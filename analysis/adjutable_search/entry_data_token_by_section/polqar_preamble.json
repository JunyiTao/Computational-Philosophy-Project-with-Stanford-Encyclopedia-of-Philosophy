    "main_text": "\n\nIsaac (Yitz\u1e25ak) Polqar was a Jewish Averroist who was active in\nnorthern Spain from the second half of the thirteenth century and the\nfirst half of the fourteenth century. Jewish Averroism refers in this\ncontext to Jewish philosophers from the thirteenth to the sixteenth\ncentury, whose worldview had two main characteristics: firstly, they\nadopted the philosophy of Ibn Rushd (Averroes), whom they considered\nthe best interpreter of Aristotle. Secondly, they interpreted Judaism\nin light of Averroes\u2019 Aristotelianism on the assumption that\nJudaism and true philosophy must always coincide. In addition to his\ninitial goal of giving the principles of Judaism a radically\nnaturalistic Averroistic interpretation, Polqar, in a more apologetic\nvein, sought to defend that interpretation from criticisms leveled\nagainst it by Christians and converts, as well as by members of his\nown Jewish community who held more traditional views. Polqar is best\nknown as the main interlocutor of his former teacher,\n Abner of Burgos\n (see entry), especially after the latter converted to Christianity\nand used his expertise in Biblical, Talmudic, and philosophical texts\nto attack the faith of his birth.\n",
