    "main_text": "Theory of Experience and Consciousness || Self-Awareness\n2.2 Self-Awareness\n\n\nThe question of how reflective thought is grounded in pure experience\nfinds a tentative answer in Nishida\u2019s next essays. How can pure\nexperience develop into reflective thought that would seem to\ninterrupt and interpret it from an external vantage point? The\nself-reflection known as self-consciousness or self-awareness\n(jikaku) provides an answer. The most basic form of consciousness\ninherently reflects or mirrors itself within itself, so that\nthere is no difference between that which reflects and what is\nreflected. In this self-awareness, immediate experiencing and reflection\nare unified. In epistemological terms, knower and known are the same,\nand this instance of unity serves as the prototype of all\nknowledge. Two points may prevent a misunderstanding of Nishida\u2019s\nposition here. First, his talk of self-awareness and\nself-reflection does not imply the pre-given existence of\nsome personal self that at times may be self-conscious. Secondly, if\nconsciousness is not placed in a pre-given self, it also is not placed\nin the objective world as a complex of brain cells or as the effect of\nmaterial objects on the mind or brain. As in modern phenomenology,\nconsciousness for Nishida means simply that which makes manifest or,\nto use a visual metaphor, that which illuminates. To emphasize its\nnon-objectifiable character, Nishida later will place consciousness\n\u201cin\u201d nothingness, that is, consider it a\n\u201cform\u201d of nothingness, and will eventually consider this a form of relative or oppositional nothingness, a non-being with respect to beings. In the meantime, he formulated it\nas the activity that precedes but ultimately unifies self and\nworld. Knowledge of things in the world begins with the\ndifferentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and\nends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes\nform not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs\nknowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive\nreach that directs sensing. In this stage of his work Nishida,\ninfluenced by Fichte and Schopenhauer, considered \u201cabsolute will\u201d as\nthe preeminent form of self-awareness and saw it as the source of acts\nof moral decision and of the creation and appreciation of art.  Since\nthe activity of the will eludes reflection, however, Nishida\neventually abandoned this formulation of a unitary source.\n",
