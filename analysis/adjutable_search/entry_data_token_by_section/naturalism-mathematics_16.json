    "main_text": "Motivating Naturalism || Historical Success\n4.5 Historical Success\n\n\nPerhaps the most promising argument for naturalism is based on\nhistorical success. Scientific and mathematical standards have a better\ntrack record than others; therefore scientific and mathematical\nstandards should be taken as authoritative, in the philosophy of\nmathematics and elsewhere. Observe that like the previous two arguments, this\nargument for naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics is an argument\nfor global naturalism.\n\n\nSome naturalists have explicitly relied on this motivation. For\nexample, Lewis uses it to reject structuralism as the correct\nphilosophy of set theory in Parts of Classes (1991,\n58\u20139) even if he disclaims it as an argument; see also Colyvan\n(2001, 33), Shapiro (1997, 30) and Burgess (1998, 197). There is much\nto say about the argument, explored in Paseau (2005). Here we\ncontent ourselves with two critical observations.\n\n\nSince philosophers deploy apparently different standards, it is not\nclear what it means to say that philosophy as a whole has a poor\nhistorical track record. Consider the early Popper (1935), who held\nthat no amount of evidence can make an unfalsified theory probable (or at least no\nmore probable than any other unfalsified theory). This is the kind of\nexample David Lewis wields to poke fun at philosophy:\nsurely\u2014surely\u2014the standards that led to this\nconclusion are not trustworthy. The theory of relativity is undoubtedly\nmore probable than the as yet unfalsified hypothesis that the world\nwill end in the year 2525. Yet if I do not share Popper's 1935\nstandards, the fact that his then philosophy of science is from my\npoint of view manifestly wrong does nothing to shake my faith in my own\nphilosophical standards. Similarly, take Thomas Aquinas, whose\nphilosophical standards included consonance with the Bible and more\ngenerally with the tenets of the Christian faith. If I am not a\nChristian, the fact that Aquinas' philosophical theology is from\nmy point of view wrong does nothing to shake my faith in my\nphilosophical standards. Thus, that Sir Karl or St Thomas' standards\nwere, as I see it, no good does not tend to undermine my faith in my\nown.\n\n\nI may therefore agree with the naturalist that philosophy has a\nworse track record than science and mathematics. But it does not follow\nthat the (non-scientific or non-mathematical) standards that I\nuse have a poor track record. If philosophers have\nconsistently assumed a more or less uniform set of standards over the\ncourse of history, and if I too follow in that tradition by\naccepting them as mine, and furthermore if these standards\ndemonstrably have a poorer track record than scientific or mathematical\nstandards, that would be a reason for me to turn naturalist. But\nthe first assumption is at least questionable, and it is not clear what\nremains of the argument from history if my standards'\nantecedents do not have a poor track record.\n\n\nA second problem with the argument has to do with its application to\nphilosophical questions. Let us agree that scientific standards have a\ngood track record when it comes to answering scientific questions, that\nmathematical standards have a good track record when it comes to\nanswering mathematical questions, and moreover that these track records\nare better than philosophical standards' track record in\nanswering philosophical questions. These facts, however, do not seem to\nbe relevant to the issue of which standards should be treated as\nauthoritative when it comes to philosophical questions. A good track\nrecord in one sphere is not in itself evidence for truth-conduciveness\nin another.\n\n\nThis by now familiar objection may be illustrated by\nconsidering the debate between platonists and structuralists in the\nphilosophy of mathematics. Platonists interpret \u20181 + 2 =\n3\u2019 as a claim about abstract objects. Structuralists on the\nother hand interpret \u20181 + 2 = 3\u2019 as a claim about what is\nthe case in any structure that satisfies the axioms of\narithmetic. (Here we are thinking of structuralism as the type of view\noften labelled \u2018eliminative structuralism\u2019 following\nCharles Parsons, and whose most sophisticated book-length\u2014and\nmodal\u2014version may be found in Hellman (1989).) Naturalists claim\nthat mathematical standards have been more successful in the past and\nhence should be trusted on this issue. But it is by no means clear\nthat this is the\ntype of question concerning which mathematical standards have\na better track record than philosophical ones. Mathematical standards\nhave a good track record when it comes to questions such as whether 1\n+ 2 is equal to 3, or what the series 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + \u2026\nconverges to, or whether the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture (concerning\nthe classification of 3-manifolds) is true; but they do not have a\nproven track record when it comes to questions such as whether these\ntruths are platonist or structuralist. (A related objection to the\nargument is that scientific standards do not speak to questions of\ninterpretation, such as the question of which of platonism or\nstructuralism to prefer.  Cf. Paseau (2007).)\n\n\nIn sum, the need for naturalists to develop these arguments or to\nproduce better ones remains pressing.\n",
