We now have a\nsense of where the action has been \u2013 the spectre of paradox, the\nsearch for unwaivable duties, the clash between self-concern and the\nneeds of others. What open questions might be the focus of the next\nbig insight, the next chapter in the story?\n\nOne question is whether duties to self are in any sense\n\u201cfoundational\u201d \u2013 either as much as or more so than\nduties to other people. The idea is associated with Kant\u2019s\nethics (see Reath 2002, sec. II). The basic idea is a moralized\nversion of RuPaul\u2019s \u201cIf you can\u2019t love yourself /\nHow in the hell you gonna love somebody else?\u201d The question,\nKantified, is that of how you could owe anything to other people if\nyou can\u2019t owe things to yourself. Margaret Gilbert\u2019s\n(2018) theory of rights also brings in rights against oneself at the\nground floor. For Gilbert, rights are the product of joint decisions,\nand they give each party to the decision a right against each that the\ndecision be carried through. That includes the right of each against\nhimself or herself. This view has the amazing consequence that,\nwhenever I violate your right against me, I also violate a right\nagainst myself \u2013 a consequence that Gilbert doesn\u2019t\nstress, but which she does accept. She even gives a partial defense at\none point, arguing that we can sensibly demand of ourselves that we\ncarry out our joint decisions with other people (2018,\n177\u201378).\n\nAnother issue is that of the \u201cSelf-Other Symmetry.\u201d If we\ndo have duties to ourselves, are they essentially similar to duties to\nothers, or fundamentally different? Most writers who take up the topic\nargue against Symmetry (Slote 1984; Stocker 1976), but some are\nsympathetic (Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 2021; Schaab 2021).\n\nA final question, shared by many writers, is whether\n\u201cobligation\u201d is the only concept that we need here. No\ndoubt, it\u2019s useful. But there is a vast and variegated range of\nthings that we do with other people that we also turn inwards in an\nintriguing way. Consider the virtues of patience, forgiveness,\ncompassion, kindness, and appreciation. It is not so obvious that the\nright theory of \u201cobligations\u201d is going to tell us how\nthese things work in general, much less in the solo case.\n\nThe deeper reason for wanting to understand self-obligation is to make\nsense of the seemingly special character of how we relate to\nourselves. To focus only on the bossiest aspects of self-relation\n\u2013 duties and demands, claims and commands \u2013 is to risk\nmissing out on the full moral richness of our inner lives.\n",
