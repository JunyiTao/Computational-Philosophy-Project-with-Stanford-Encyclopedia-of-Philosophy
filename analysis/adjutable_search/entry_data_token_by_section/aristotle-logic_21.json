Concern\nwith answering the question \u201cWhat is so-and-so?\u201d are at\nthe center of the majority of Plato\u2019s dialogues, some of which\n(most elaborately the Sophist) propound methods for finding\ndefinitions. External sources (sometimes the satirical remarks of\ncomedians) also reflect this Academic concern with definitions.\nAristotle himself traces the quest for definitions back to\nSocrates.\n",
