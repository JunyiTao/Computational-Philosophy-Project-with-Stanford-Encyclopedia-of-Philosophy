    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics || Noneism\n3.1 Noneism\n\n\nFrom 1965 on, Sylvan argued that, through the influence of Quine,\ncontemporary philosophy is committed to a fundamental mistake. Such a\nmistake, labelled the \u201cOntological Assumption\u201d (cf. 1980),\nis represented by the view that one cannot make true statements about\nwhat does not exist. In opposition to this idea, Sylvan develops a\ntheory about (non-existent) objects or, in Sylvan\u2019s jargon,\nitems\u2014noneism.\n\n\n[Noneism is] a very general theory of all items whatsoever, of those\nthat are intensional and those that are not, of those that exist and\nthose that do not (\u2026); it is a theory of the logic and\nproperties and kinds of properties of all items (1980,\n5\u20136)\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s intuition is that, in order to be able to say something\ntrue about non-existent items, we need to allow for the possibility\nthat non-existent items have properties. For instance, in order to be\nable to say that \u2018Sherlock Holmes is a detective\u2019 is true,\nSherlock Holmes needs to have the property of\nbeing a detective. Now, according to Sylvan, a suitable\nphilosophical background for supporting this intuition is\nMeinong\u2019s Theory of Objects. For this reason, in\nExploring Meinong\u2019s Jungle and Beyond (Routley 1980),\nSylvan tries to deliver a modern logical presentation of\nMeinong\u2019s philosophy. He writes:\n\n\nMeinong\u2019s theory provides a coherent scheme for talking and\nreasoning about all items, not just those which exist, without the\nnecessity for distorting or unworkable reductions; and in doing so it\nattributes \u2026 features [properties] to nonentities [non-existent\nobjects] (1980, iv\u2013v).\n\n\nAt nearly 1000 pages, Routley (1980) develops noneism in great\ndetail. We summarize it in five main theses, which represent the core\nassumptions of what Sylvan calls minimal noneism (from now on\nMN). First of all, following Meinong\u2019s account\nof intentionality, Sylvan believes that:\n\n\n(MN1)\n\u201ceverything whatever (\u2026) is an object [an item]\u201d\n\n\n\n(1980, 1\u20132; 352). In other words, every time we refer to\nsomething, we refer to an item. If I tell a story about Sherlock\nHolmes, I tell a story about an item, namely that item that is the\nsubject matter of my story.\n\n\nThe second thesis is that:\n\n\n(MN2)\n\u201cvery many objects [items] do not exist\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2\u20133). Sylvan follows Meinong in claiming that some items\nexist (e.g., the Eiffel Tower) and some others do not (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). Like Meinong, Sylvan treats existence as a property: some\nitems have the property of being red and some other items do\nnot; some items have the property of being existent (e.g.,\nthe Eiffel Tower) and some items do not (e.g., Sherlock Holmes). When\nitems do not have the property of being existent, they are\nnon-existent items. In Sylvan\u2019s jargon, they are\n\u201cnonentities\u201d.\n\n\nFurthermore, according to the third and fourth theses:\n\n\n(MN3)\n\u201cnon-existent objects [items] are constituted in one way or another\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2\u20133), and\n\n\n(MN4)\n\u201cevery object [item] has the \u2018characteristics\u2019 it has irrespective of whether it exists\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2\u20133). Thesis (MN3)\ncorresponds to Meinong\u2019s indifference principle: the\nproperties an item has are indifferent to the ontological status of\nthe item itself. Thesis (MN4) corresponds\nto Meinong\u2019s independence principle: an item\u2019s\nhaving properties is independent of whether the item in\nquestion exists or not.\n\n\nAs many have pointed out (cf. Russell 1905 and 1907; see also Berto\n2013 and Priest 2005), the original theory defended by Meinong faces\nproblems. In particular, Meinong\u2019s theory is threatened by\ntriviality (Berto 2013, 106\u2013107); that is, the\nsituation in which everything exists\u2014including items that\nclearly do not.  E.g., if I refer to not just to Sherlock Holmes but\nto \u201cthe\nexisting Sherlock Holmes\u201d, then it seems\nby (MN4) that Sherlock Holmes exists.\n\n\nIn order to resolve this issue, Sylvan makes two moves. First of all,\nhe introduces the distinction between characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties. The former are necessary in order to\ndefine the essence of an object. A characterizing property is a\nproperty (e.g., being a detective or being smart)\nthat is necessary in order to make a specific item (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes) the item that it is. Using Sylvan\u2019s words:\n\n\nCharacterizing predicates [or properties] are those which specify what\nan item is like, in itself. They tell how an item is in fact. They\ngive its description. A good dossier of an item would perhaps give its\ncharacterization first, by way of its characterization features [or\nproperties] (Sylvan 1995b).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the non-characterizing properties are all those\nproperties that are not characterizing. According to Sylvan, the\nproperty of being existent is a non-characterizing\nproperty.\n\n\nAs it has been extensively argued in the secondary literature (see,\nfor instance, Priest 2005), the difference between these two kinds of\nproperties is unclear. It is also fair to say that, even though some\n(neo-)Meinongians have tried to cash out such a distinction in more\nprecise terms (see, for instance, Jacquette 2015 and 2017; Parsons\n1978 and 1980), there is little consensus that any progress has been\nmade. That being said, even though it is certainly difficult to have\nstrict criteria to separate the characterizing properties from the\nnon-characterizing ones, it is absolutely clear that:\n\n\n(MN5)\n\u201cneither existence nor non-existence is a characterizing property\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2). This is the fifth and last thesis.\n\n\nThe second move Sylvan makes in response to the triviality problem is\nrepresented by the idea that, even though it is the case that every\ntime we refer to something we refer to an item, the item in question\nhas characterizing properties. Following Berto (2013), we can also say\nthat, consistent with some other neo-Meinongians (i.e., Jacquette 2015;\nParsons 1980), Sylvan argues in favour of the following\ncharacterization principle:\n\n\nfor any set of characterizing properties, some item satisfies\nit.\n\n\nConsider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When we refer to Sherlock\nHolmes, we refer to an item (because of\n(MN1)). Moreover, even though Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist (because of (MN2)),\nhe has some characterizing properties (because of\n(MN3) and\n(MN4)). For instance, according to\nDoyle\u2019s novels, Sherlock Holmes is a smart detective. If so, in\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s set of characterizing properties, there are, at\nleast, two properties: being a detective and being\nsmart. However, the property being non-existent is not in\nthis set because it is a non-characterizing property. And this is\nguaranteed by (MN5).\n\n\nAs we have already specified above, minimal noneism is merely\nthe core of Sylvan\u2019s noneism which is more elaborate and\nsophisticated than sketched here. Exactly because of its complexity,\nnoneism forces us to rethink some of our traditional approaches to\nimportant philosophical topics. Examples are intensionality,\nnonexistence, impossibilia, and paradoxicality. Moreover, in the light\nof these conceptual innovations, Sylvan also discusses some of the\nrelevant applications of noneism in philosophy of mathematics (cf.\n1980, 769\u2013781 and 791\u2013833), philosophy of perception\n(cf. 1980, 649\u2013678), philosophy of time (cf. 1980,\n361\u2013410); philosophy of science (cf. 1980, 781\u2013791) and\nphilosophy of fiction (cf. 1980, 537\u2013595).\n\n\nSylvan spent many years developing and defending noneism, but he was\nnot entirely satisfied with it. He had two major complaints. On the\none hand, he thought that his way of presenting noneism was\nrhetorically problematic: EMJB was too long, rambling, and not\nincisive enough. As such, EMJB needed to be rewritten (see Sylvan\n1995b). On the other hand, he aimed at \u201cliberalizing\nnoneism\u201d by allowing all items to have both characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties (Sylvan 1995b). Archival documents show\nthat, to this end, Sylvan tried to develop a new theory that has many\nfeatures in common with so-called \u201cmodal Meinongianism\u201d,\nrecently defended by Priest. On these issues, see Casati (2018),\nGriffin (2018), Kroon (2019), Priest (2005).\n",
