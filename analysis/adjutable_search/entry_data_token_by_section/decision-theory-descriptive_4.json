    "main_text": "The Issue of Independence || Allais\u2019 paradoxes\n2.1 Allais\u2019 paradoxes\n\nAllais (1953a: 527) considered hypothetical preferences revealed by\nchoices taken from two respective menus of lotteries yielding various\nincrements in wealth with various objective probabilities, one\ncontaining \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\) below, the other \\(P_3\\) and\n\\(P_4\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nHe claimed that, for a substantial proportion of agents, one would\nfind that \\(P_{1}\\succ P_{2}\\) and \\(P_{4}\\succ P_{3}\\) (call these\nthe \u201cAllais preferences\u201d). However, on the\nassumptions that (i) the subjects\u2019 degrees of belief align\nthemselves with the objective probabilities given and (ii) the\noutcomes can be adequately characterised entirely in terms of the\nassociated changes in level of wealth, such a combination of\npreferences runs contrary to Independence. More specifically, it runs\ncounter to the special case of the principle, according to which the\nsubstitution of a common \u201cconsequence\u201d, i.e., lottery, in\na pair of mixtures leave the order of preference unchanged:\n\n\nCommon Consequence For all acts \\(f, g, h, h'\\) and\n\\(\\lambda\\in(0,1]\\):  \n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\lambda P_f + (1-\\lambda) P_h\\succeq \\lambda P_g + (1-\\lambda) P_h\\\\\n\\textrm{ iff }\\lambda P_f + (1-\\lambda) P_{h'}\\succeq \\lambda P_g + (1-\\lambda) P_{h'}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo see why, let \\(\\lambda=0.11\\), \\(Q_1\\) (the\n\u201cconsequence\u201d common to \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\)) be a lottery\nyielding $\\(1\\)M for sure, \\(Q_2\\) be a lottery yielding $\\(5\\)M with\nprobability \\(10/11\\) and \\(\\$0\\) otherwise, and finally \\(Q_3\\) (the\n\u201cconsequence\u201d common to \\(P_3\\) and \\(P_4\\)) a lottery\nyielding \\(\\$0\\) for sure. \\(P_1\\) turns out to be a\n\\(\\lambda\\)-mixture of \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_1\\), \\(P_2\\) one of \\(Q_2\\) and\n\\(Q_1\\), \\(P_3\\) one of \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) and \\(P_4\\) one of \\(Q_2\\)\nand \\(Q_3\\). This is probably best seen by considering the decision\ntrees representing the corresponding compound lotteries:\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nThe upshot of this, by Common Consequence, is then that \\(P_1\\succeq\nP_2\\) iff \\(P_3\\succeq\n P_4\\).[4]\n\n\nThe probability triangle affords a helpful illustration of the\nincompatibility of the Allais preferences with SEU. Indeed, the\nsegments connecting \\(P_1\\) and \\( P_2\\), on the one hand, and \\(\nP_3\\) and \\(P_4\\) on the other are parallel, so that an EU maximiser,\nwhose indifference curves are also parallel, would be incapable of\nexhibiting the modal preferences, since no pair of indifference curves\ncould be, as required, such that one crosses the segment \\([P_1,P_2]\\)\nfrom below while the other crosses \\([P_3,P_4]\\) from above:\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nIn addition to the above, which has come to be known as the Common\nConsequence problem, a further issue, the Common Ratio\nproblem, was suggested by Allais (1953a: 529\u2013530). The\ndifficulty this time concerned a further consequence of Independence,\nwhich tells us that the order of preference between two\nidentically-weighted mixtures that share a common component lottery is\nunaffected by a change in the mixture weight:\n\n\nCommon Ratio For all acts \\(f,g,h\\) and\n\\(\\lambda,\\gamma\\in(0,1]\\):  \n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\lambda P_f + (1-\\lambda) P_h\\succeq \\lambda P_g + (1-\\lambda) P_h\\\\\n\\textrm{ iff }\n\\gamma P_f + (1-\\gamma) P_h\\succeq \\gamma P_g + (1-\\gamma) P_h.\n\\end{split}\\]\n\n\n\nA presentation of the relevant pairs of options will not be given\nhere. Note simply that, here again, the problematic choices turn out\nto involve two pairs of options whose respective corresponding\nsegments in the probability triangle run\n parallel.[5]\n\n\nA number of experimental studies in the 1960s and 1970s subsequently\nconfirmed the robustness of the effects uncovered by Allais. Slovic\n& Tversky (1974), for example, report that 17 out of 29 (59%) of\nsubjects in their study exhibit Allais preferences in their\ninvestigation of the Common Consequence problem. See MacCrimmon &\nLarson (1979) for a helpful summary of this and other early work and\nfurther data of their own.\n\nSince the late 1970s, a considerable number of generalisations of SEU\nhave been devised to accommodate the problematic preference patterns.\nA brief survey of these is provided in the following subsection.\n",
