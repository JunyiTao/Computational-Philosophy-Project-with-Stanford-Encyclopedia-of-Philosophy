    "main_text": "The Process of Thinking Critically\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\n\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\n\nsuggestions, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem to be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (reasoning, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\n\n\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\n\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\n Transit\n might have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\n Typhoid\n as avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\n\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n",
