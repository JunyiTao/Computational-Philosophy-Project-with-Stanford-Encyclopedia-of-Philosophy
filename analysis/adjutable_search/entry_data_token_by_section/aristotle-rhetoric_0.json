Aristotle\u2019s Works on Rhetoric\n\nThe work that has come down to us as Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric or Art of Rhetoric consists of three books,\nwhile the ancient catalogue of the Aristotelian works, reported e.g.\nby Diogenes Laertius, mentions only two books on rhetoric (probably\nour Rhetoric I & II), plus two further books on style\n(perhaps our Rhetoric III?). Whereas most modern authors\nagree that at least the core of Rhetoric I & II presents\na coherent rhetorical theory, the two themes of Rhetoric III\n(style/diction and the partition of speeches) are not mentioned in the\noriginal agenda of Rhetoric I & II. The conceptual link\nbetween Rhetoric I & II and Rhetoric III is not\ngiven until the very last sentence of the second book, so the\nauthenticity of this seeming ad hoc connection is slightly\nsuspicious; we cannot rule out the possibility that these two parts of\nthe Rhetoric were not put together until the first complete\nedition of Aristotle\u2019s works was accomplished by Andronicus of\nRhodes in the first century. In Aristotle\u2019s Poetics\n(1456a33) we find a cross-reference to a work called\n\u2018Rhetoric\u2019 which obviously refers only to\nRhetoric I & II, but does not seem to include the agenda\nof Rhetoric III, suggesting that Aristotle at this time\nregards Rhetoric I & II as the complete work. Regardless\nof such doubts, the systematic idea that links the two heterogeneous\nparts of the Rhetoric \u2014 Rhetoric I & II on\nthe one hand and Rhetoric III on the other\u2014 does make\ngood sense: it is not enough, or so the linking passage says, to have\na supply of things to say (the so-called \u2018thought\u2019); one\nshould also know how to express or formulate those things (the\nso-called \u2018style\u2019), so that the project of\nRhetoric I & II concerning what we say (or the\n\u2018thought\u2019) needs to be complemented by the peculiar\nproject of Rhetoric III (i.e. a treatise on\n\u2018style\u2019).\n\nThe chronological fixing of the Rhetoric has turned out to be\na delicate and controversial matter. At least the core of\nRhetoric I & II seems to be an early work (see e.g.\nD\u00fcring 1966, 118\u2013125, Rist 1989, 85\u201386, Rapp 2002 I,\n178\u2013184), written during Aristotle\u2019s first stay in Athens\n(it is unclear, however, which chapters belong to that core; regularly\nmentioned are the chapters I.4\u201315 and II.1\u201317). It is true\nthat the Rhetoric also refers to historical events that fall\nin the time of Aristotle\u2019s exile and his second stay in Athens\n(see \u00a7 1 of\n Aristotle),\n but most of them can be found in just two chapters, namely chapters\nII.23\u201324, and moreover such examples could have been updated,\nwhich is especially plausible if we assume that the Rhetoric\nformed the basis of a lecture course held several times. However, what\nis most striking are its affinities to the early work Topics\n(for the idea that the Topics is early see e.g. Solmsen 1929,\n191\u2013195; for a discussion of Solmsen\u2019s theses in English\nsee Stocks 1933); if, as is widely agreed nowadays, the\nTopics represents a pre-syllogistic stage of Aristotelian\nlogic, the same is likely to be true of the Rhetoric, as we\nactually find only few or even no hints to syllogistic inventory in\nit. (Indeed, the Rhetoric includes two short passages that\nexplicitly refer to the Analytics, which presents\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic theory: I.2, 1357a22\u20131358a2,\nII.25, 1402b13\u20131403a16. Some authors \u2014 e.g. Solmsen 1929,\n13\u201331, Burnyeat 1994, 31, Allen 2001, 20\u201340 \u2014 take\nthis as evidence that at least in these two passages the\nRhetoric makes use of the syllogistic theory, while others\n\u2014 e.g. Rapp 2002, II 202\u2013204 \u2014 object to this\ninference.)\n\nIt seems that Aristotle was the author not only of the\nRhetoric as we know it today, but of several treatises\ndealing with rhetoric. According to ancient testimonies, Aristotle\nwrote an early dialogue on rhetoric entitled\n\u2018Grullos\u2019, in which he put forward arguments for\nwhy rhetoric cannot be an art (techn\u00ea); and since this\nis precisely the position of Plato\u2019s Gorgias (see\n\u00a74 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry),\n the lost dialogue Grullos has traditionally been regarded as\na sign of Aristotle\u2019s (alleged) early Platonism (see Solmsen\n1929, 196\u2013208). But the evidence for the position defended in\nthis dialogue is too tenuous to support such strong conclusions: it\nalso could have been a \u2018dialectical\u2019 dialogue, simply\nlisting the pros and cons of the thesis that rhetoric is an art (see\nLossau 1974). We are in a similar situation concerning another lost\nwork on rhetoric, the so-called \u2018Techn\u00ea\nSunagog\u00ea\u2019, a collection of previous theories of\nrhetoric that is also ascribed to Aristotle. Cicero seems to use this\ncollection, or at least a secondary source relying on it, as his main\nhistorical source when he gives a short survey of the history of\npre-Aristotelian rhetoric in his Brutus 46\u201348. Finally,\nAristotle once mentions a work called\n\u2018Theodecteia\u2019 which has also been supposed to be\nAristotelian; but more probably he refers to the rhetorical handbook\nof his follower Theodectes, who was also a former pupil of Isocrates.\nFrom these lost works on rhetoric we only have a meagre collection of\nscattered fragments (frg. 68\u201369 R3, 114\nR3, 125\u2013141 R3: see Rose 1886).\n",
