    "main_text": "\n\nRichard Dedekind (1831\u20131916) was one of the greatest\nmathematicians of the nineteenth-century, as well as one of the most\nimportant contributors to algebra and number theory of all time. Any\ncomprehensive history of mathematics will mention him for his\ninvestigation of the notions of algebraic number, field, group,\nmodule, lattice, etc., and especially for the invention of his theory\nof ideals (see, e.g., Dieudonn\u00e9 1985, Boyer & Merzbach\n1991, Stillwell 2000, Kolmogorov & Yushkevich 2001, Wussing 2012).\nDedekind\u2019s more foundational work in mathematics is also widely known.\nOften acknowledged in that connection are: his analysis of the notion\nof continuity, his introduction of the real numbers by means of\nDedekind cuts, his formulation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms for the\nnatural numbers, his proof of the categoricity of these axioms, and\nhis contributions to the early development of set theory\n(Grattan-Guinness 1980, Ferreir\u00f3s 1996, 1999, 2016b, Jahnke\n2003, Corry 2015).\n\nWhile many of Dedekind\u2019s contributions to mathematics and its\nfoundations are thus common knowledge, they are seldom discussed\ntogether. In particular, his foundational writings are often treated\nseparately from his other writings. This entry provides a broader and\nmore integrative survey. The main focus will be on Dedekind\u2019s\nfoundational writings, but they will be related to his mathematical\nwork as a whole. Indeed, it will be argued that foundational concerns\nare at play throughout, so that any attempt to distinguish sharply\nbetween his \u201cmathematical\u201d and his\n\u201cfoundational\u201d work is artificial and misleading. Another\ngoal of the entry is to establish the continuing relevance of his\ncontributions to the philosophy of mathematics. Their full\nsignificance has only started to be recognized, as should become\nevident. This is especially so with respect to methodological and\nepistemological aspects of Dedekind\u2019s approach, which ground the\nlogical and metaphysical views that emerge in his writings.\n",
