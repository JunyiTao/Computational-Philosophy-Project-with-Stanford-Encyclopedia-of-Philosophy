Talk of models often refers to\nfragments of theories, to mere approximations and to objects (or\ndescriptions of objects) that are used to represent a given target.\nGiven that the common interpretation of classical conceptions of\nreduction requires the relata to be fully fledged theories, it is not\nclear how sciences such as biology, psychology, and neuroscience fit\ninto the picture. In these areas, such imperfect, highly idealized or\nmerely approximately correct models dominate theorizing, and often\nmodel-descriptions are accompanied by visualizations, which might\nraise further questions as to the applicability of purely or mainly\nsyntactic notions of reduction (Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2005). There\nare no definitions of reduction that accommodate that fact directly;\nthat is, there are no definitions of how one model reduces to another\nthat might serve as a counterpart to those we have for\ntheory-to-theory reduction. Rather, definitions of reduction directed\nat model-based theorizing are often described in ontological terms: It\nis the mechanisms, or phenomena captured by the models that allegedly\nreduce. The models themselves reduce only in a derivative sense (a\ndiscussion of these and related issues is covered in the entry on\n reductionism in biology.)\n\nIf, on the other hand, structuralist reconstructions of\n\u201cimperfect\u201d theories are successful, then model-reductions\nmight be covered by Theory-Reduction II. Moreover, it has\nbeen argued that Nagel\u2019s model should not be interpreted too\nstrictly; at least, it maybe was intended to cover model-reductions as\nwell (van Riel 2011).\n",
