Work in the foundations and philosophy of mathematics\n\n\nTowards the end of his Address on the Unity of Knowledge, \ndelivered at the 1954 Columbia University bicentennial celebrations, \nWeyl enumerates what he considers to be the essential constituents of\nknowledge. At the top of his \n list[7]\n comes\n\n\n\u2026intuition, mind\u2019s ordinary act of seeing what is\ngiven to it. (Weyl 1954, 629)\n\n\nIn particular Weyl held to the view that intuition, or \ninsight\u2014rather than proof\u2014furnishes the\nultimate foundation of mathematical knowledge. Thus in his \nDas Kontinuum of 1918 he says:\n\nIn the Preface to Dedekind (1888) we read that \u201cIn science,\nwhatever is provable must not be believed without proof.\u201d This\nremark is certainly characteristic of the way most mathematicians\nthink. Nevertheless, it is a preposterous principle. As if such an\nindirect concatenation of grounds, call it a proof though we may, can\nawaken any \u201cbelief\u201d apart from assuring ourselves through\nimmediate insight that each individual step is correct. In all cases,\nthis process of confirmation\u2014and not the proof\u2014remains\nthe ultimate source from which knowledge derives its authority; it is\nthe \u201cexperience of truth\u201d. (Weyl 1987, 119)\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s idealism naturally inclined him to the view that the ultimate \nbasis of his own subject, mathematics, must be found in the \nintuitively given as opposed to the transcendent. Nevertheless, he \nrecognized that it would be unreasonable to require all mathematical \nknowledge to possess intuitive immediacy. In Das Kontinuum, \nfor example, he says:\n\nThe states of affairs with which mathematics deals are, apart from the\nvery simplest ones, so complicated that it is practically impossible\nto bring them into full givenness in consciousness and in this way to\ngrasp them completely. (Ibid., 17)\n\n\nNevertheless, Weyl felt that this fact, inescapable as it might be, \ncould not justify extending the bounds of mathematics to embrace \nnotions, such as the actual infinite, which cannot be given fully in \nintuition even in principle. He held, rather, that such extensions of\nmathematics into the transcendent are warranted only by the fact that\nmathematics plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences, in \nwhich intuitive evidence is necessarily transcended. As he says in \nThe Open \n World[8]:\n \n\u2026 if mathematics is taken by itself, one should\nrestrict oneself with Brouwer to the intuitively cognizable truths\n\u2026 nothing compels us to go farther. But in the natural sciences\nwe are in contact with a sphere which is impervious to intuitive\nevidence; here cognition necessarily becomes symbolical construction.\nHence we need no longer demand that when mathematics is taken into the\nprocess of theoretical construction in physics it should be possible to\nset apart the mathematical element as a special domain in which all\njudgments are intuitively certain; from this higher standpoint which\nmakes the whole of science appear as one unit, I consider Hilbert to be\nright. (Weyl 1932, 82).\n\n\nIn Consistency in Mathematics (1929), Weyl characterized the\nmathematical method as\nthe a priori construction of the possible in opposition to\nthe a posteriori description of what is actually\n given.[9]\n\n\n\nThe problem of identifying the limits on constructing \u201cthe \npossible\u201d in this sense occupied Weyl a great deal. He was \nparticularly concerned with the concept of the mathematical \ninfinite, which he believed to elude \n\u201cconstruction\u201d in the naive set-theoretical sense \n [10].\n Again to quote a passage from Das Kontinuum:\n\nNo one can describe an infinite set other than by indicating\nproperties characteristic of the elements of the set\u2026. The\nnotion that a set is a \u201cgathering\u201d brought together by\ninfinitely many individual arbitrary acts of selection, assembled and\nthen surveyed as a whole by consciousness, is nonsensical;\n\u201cinexhaustibility\u201d is essential to the infinite. (Weyl\n1987, 23)\n\n\nBut still, as Weyl attests towards the end of The Open \nWorld, \u201cthe demand for totality and the metaphysical \nbelief in reality inevitably compel the mind to represent the \ninfinite as closed being by symbolical construction\u201d. The \nconception of the completed infinite, even if nonsensical, is \ninescapable.\n",
