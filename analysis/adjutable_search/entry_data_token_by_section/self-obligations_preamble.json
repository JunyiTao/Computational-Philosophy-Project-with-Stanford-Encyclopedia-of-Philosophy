    "main_text": "\n\nMoral philosophy is often said to be about what we owe to each\nother. Do we owe anything to ourselves?\n\nPhilosophers are torn. On the one hand, obligations to self are a\nmainstay of moral theories \u2013 most famously Kant\u2019s \u2013\nas well as ordinary thinking. It is not just academic Kantians who\nbelieve in making something of our lives and standing up for\nourselves. And yet, the idea of literally owing things to oneself can\nsound paradoxical. When I owe you $5, I am bound to pay. When you owe\nme $5, I can waive the debt away. Now suppose I owe myself $5.\nDon\u2019t I then have the power to waive my own obligation?\nBut then how could it bind me? An obligation I can escape at will is\nlike a prison with an open gate, a speed limit with no penalty. Such\nan obligation seems powerless, toothless, imperceptible \u2013 in\nother words, it seems like no obligation at all.\n\nThis paradox has cast a long shadow. In the 20th century,\nobligations to oneself \u201clargely disappeared from the radar of\nacademic philosophers\u201d (Cholbi 2015, 852), as the traditional\nquestion of what we owe to ourselves gave way to doubts about\nwhether such obligations are even coherent.\n\nBut in the new century, the topic has enjoyed a renaissance, with\nfresh theories cropping up for the first time in decades and\napplications arising across a range of fascinating issues: privacy and\npromises, self-respect and supererogation, tech-addiction and tattoos.\nSome have even wondered, echoing Kant, if the topic might lie at the\nvery heart of ethics.\n\nWe begin with the question of what obligations to oneself are supposed\nto be (\u00a71). From there we lay out the \u201cparadox\u201d and\nits history (\u00a72), along with the three theories that have arisen\nin response (\u00a7\u00a73\u20135). We conclude (\u00a77) after a\nsurvey of applied issues (\u00a76), focusing on topics of broad\ninterest, but sprinkling in a few specifics \u2013 like Kant\u2019s\nqualms about haircuts \u2013 for the sake of spice.\n",
