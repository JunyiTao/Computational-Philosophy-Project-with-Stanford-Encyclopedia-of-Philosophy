    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Anarchism is Incoherent\n4.4 Anarchism is Incoherent\n\nObjection: This objection holds that a political\ntheory that abolishes political structures makes no sense. A related\nconcern arises when anarchism is taken to be a critique of authority\nin every case and in all senses. If anarchists deny then that there\ncan be any arch\u00e9 whatsoever, then the claim\ncontradicts itself: we would have a ruling theory that states that\nthere is no ruling theory. This sort of criticism is related to\nstandard criticisms of relativism and nihilism. Related to this is a\nmore concrete and mundane objection that holds that there can be no\nanarchist movement or collective action, since anarchism is\nconstitutionally opposed to the idea of a movement or collective\n(since under anarchism there can be no authoritative ruler or set of\nrules).\n\nReply: This objection only holds if anarchism is\ntaken to be an all-or-nothing theory of the absolutist variety.\nPolitical anarchists do not necessarily agree with the skeptical\npost-foundationalist critique which holds that there can be no ruling\nprinciple or authority whatsoever. Rather, political anarchists hold\nthat there are legitimate authorities but that political power quickly\nloses its authoritativeness and legitimacy. Furthermore, anarchists\ntend to advocate for a principle and procedure for organization based\nupon voluntarism and mutual aid, as well as unanimity and/or\nconsensus. From this point of view anarchist communities can work very\nwell, provided that they avoid coercive authority. To support this\npoint anarchists will point to historical examples of successful\nanarchist communes. They will also point to ordinary human\nrelations\u2014in families and civil society relationship\u2014which\noperate quite well apart form coercive and hierarchical political\nauthority\n",
