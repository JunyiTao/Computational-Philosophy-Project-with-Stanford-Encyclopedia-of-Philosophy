    "main_text": "Applications and Other Related Notions || Substance\n6.3 Substance\n\nOne important application of ontological dependence is the analysis of\nthe notion of \u201csubstance\u201d\u2014a basic or fundamental\nentity which possesses at least some degree of ontological independence\n(for discussion on the various uses of \u201csubstance\u201d in\nphilosophy, see the separate entry on\n substance).\n If the idea of ontological independence is somehow associated with\n\u201csubstance\u201d, then it seems that some account of what the\nrelevant dependence amounts to will be required. In fact, those\nfamiliar with Lowe 2005 [2010] (an earlier version of the present\nentry), will recall that the discussion was entirely focused on\nfinding the most plausible account of ontological dependence for the\npurposes of analyzing the notion of substance (this discussion\noriginates from Lowe 1998: Ch. 6). This also ties in with a more\ngeneral application of ontological dependence, namely, the study of\nformal ontological relations obtaining between ontological categories,\nof which substance is a prime example (see also Hoffman &\nRosenkrantz 1994, Schaffer 2009, and Nolan 2011). So how should we\ndefine \u201csubstance\u201d given the various notions of\nontological dependence that we have at our disposal? It will be\nrecalled that one particularly powerful notion of ontological\ndependence is the notion of identity-dependence, which we arrived at\nwhen looking for an asymmetrical\u2014or, at least, an\nantisymmetrical\u2014relationship of ontological dependence.\nIt seems that if substances are considered as ontologically\nindependent entities, then an asymmetric relation is\nrequired. One possibility for defining substance, which relies on\n (EDR)\n is the following:\n\n(SUB-1)\n x is a substance =df x is a particular\nand there is no particular y such that y is not\nidentical with x and x dependsR for its\nexistence upon y.\n\n\n(SUB-1) could be seen to follow the precedent of Aristotle,\nwho\u2014in the Categories\u2014admitted only\nparticulars as \u201cprimary\u201d substances, while\nallowing some universals (the species and genera of primary\nsubstances) the status of \u201csecondary\u201d substances (see\nAristotle, Categories: Ch. 2). However, (SUB-1), because it\nrelies on\n (EDR),\n will be unsatisfactory for those who are convinced that the\nmodal-existential analysis of ontological dependence is not\nsufficiently fine-grained; it will face the type of problems that we\nhave discussed above in\n \u00a72.2.\n We know already that it won\u2019t do to replace the notion of\nexistential dependence employed in (SUB-1) by appealing instead to the\nrelation of essential existential dependence, as defined by\n (EDE),\n because the latter is neither an asymmetrical nor an antisymmetrical\nrelation. Indeed, this is one lesson of the example of the\nsphere\u2019s two hemispheres discussed immediately after the\ndefinition for (EDE) was given. For, whereas the whole sphere\nmight well be taken to qualify as a substance, neither of its\n\u201chalves\u201d plausibly can, because they lack the requisite\nkind of ontological independence. But, while (SUB-1) reinterpreted in\nterms of (EDE) does indeed have the implication that neither of the\nhemispheres is a substance\u2014because each dependsE for\nits existence on the other and hence on a particular distinct from\nitself\u2014it also has the unwanted implication that the whole\nsphere is not a substance for the same reason, because it is\narguably a part of the essence of the sphere as a whole that it exists\nonly if each of its hemispheres exists. However, an obvious remedy is\nat hand. We can simply replace the appeal to any species of\nexistential dependence in a definition on the pattern of\n(SUB-1) by an appeal to the relation of identity-dependence,\nas defined by\n (ID),\n to give:\n\n(SUB-2)\n x is a substance =df x is a particular\nand there is no particular y such that y is not\nidentical with x and x depends for its identity upon\ny.\n\n\nComposite substances appear to comply with (SUB-2): for, plausibly,\nalthough they possess proper parts, they do not depend for their\nidentity upon those parts, since which objects those\nparts are does not help to determine of which substances they\nare parts (the same objects being capable of becoming parts of many\ndifferent substances). Moreover, substances quite generally do not\ndepend for their identity upon their (accidental) particularized\nproperties, if such exist, nor upon the events in which they\nparticipate, nor upon the places they occupy, nor upon other\nsubstances. The particularized properties (i.e., tropes or modes) of\nsubstances and the events in which substances participate\u2014that\nis, items such as the particular redness of this apple and the\nassassination of Caesar\u2014would appear to depend for their\nidentity upon those substances, which precludes the reverse\nrelationship from obtaining, on pain of circularity. (However, see\nKein\u00e4nen & Hakkarainen 2014 for discussion; in particular,\nthey propose a strategy for identifying tropes that does not entail\ncircularity in the individuation of tropes. See also Moltmann 2019,\nwhich discusses the problem of spatial location related to tropes and\nother entities.) As for places, although a physical substance must\nindeed occupy some place, which place it occupies\ndoes not determine which substance it is, since substances\nmay exchange places.\n\nOne motivation for rejecting the appeal to\n (EDR)\n in the analysis of substance is that it permits two different\nentities to be existentially dependentR upon one\nanother\u2014entities such as Socrates and Socrates\u2019s\nlife. As we have seen,\n (ID)\n precludes any analogous symmetry where identity-dependence\nis concerned: indeed, it delivers the intuitively correct verdict that\nit is Socrates\u2019s life that is, in this sense,\nontologically dependent upon Socrates, rather than vice\nversa. For Socrates\u2019s life is an extended event or process\nin which he participates\u2014and which person Socrates is\npartially determines which event this is, but not vice\nversa. Or, to put it another way\u2014one which should by now be\nfamiliar\u2014it is part of the essence of Socrates\u2019s\nlife that it is the life of Socrates, but it is not\npart of the essence of Socrates that he is the person who lived that\nlife. Of course, we can still acknowledge that the relation defined by\n (EDR)\n does hold mutually between Socrates and his life and we can still\ncall this relationship a type of existential\ndependence\u2014namely, \u201crigid\u201d existential\ndependence. Similarly, we can recognize as other species of\nexistential dependence the \u201cgeneric\u201d existential\ndependence defined by\n (EDG),\n the \u201casymmetrical\u201d rigid existential dependence defined\nby\n (EDA)\n and the \u201cessential\u201d existential dependence defined by\n (EDE).\n\nThe key point is simply that, in the sense of \u201contological\ndependence\u201d which fits quite naturally with the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d account of substances as\nontologically independent objects, the relationships defined\nby\n (EDR),\n (EDG),\n (EDA),\n and\n (EDE)\n will not serve the purpose, whereas that defined by\n (ID)\nwill. On this view, the sense in which a substance is an\nentity which does not depend \u201contologically\u201d upon anything\nother than itself is exactly the sense in which it does not depend for\nits identity upon anything else. This still leaves many\ninteresting questions concerning ontological (in)dependence\nunanswered, notably the question of whether there is a fundamental\nlevel or layer of reality, consisting of one or more\nentities upon which all other existing entities depend ontologically\nin one way or another (for discussion, see Lowe 1998: 154\u201373;\nSchaffer 2003; Cameron 2008; and Paseau 2010).\n",
