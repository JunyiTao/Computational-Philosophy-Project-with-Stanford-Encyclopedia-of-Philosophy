Two Reasons for Thinking that Free Will is Incompatible with Determinism\n\nA common first response to determinism is to think that it means that\nour choices make no difference to anything that happens\nbecause earlier causes have pre-determined or \u201cfixed\u201d our\nentire future (Nahmias 2011). It is easy to think that determinism\nimplies that we have a destiny or fate that we cannot avoid, no matter\nwhat we choose or decide and no matter how hard we try.\n\n\nMan, when running over, frequently without his own knowledge,\nfrequently in spite of himself, the route which nature has marked out\nfor him, resembles a swimmer who is obliged to follow the current that\ncarries him along; he believes himself a free agent because he\nsometimes consents, sometimes does not consent, to glide with the\nstream, which, notwithstanding, always hurries him forward. (Holbach\n1770 [2002]: 181; see also Wegner 2003)\n\n\nIt is widely agreed, by incompatibilists as well as compatibilists,\nthat this is a mistake. Empirical discoveries about our brain and\nbehavior might tell us that we don\u2019t have as much conscious\ncontrol as we think we have (Wegner 2003; Libet 1999). (For critique\nof arguments claiming that recent scientific research has shown that\n\u201cconscious will is an illusion\u201d, see Mele 2009, some of\nthe essays in Sinnott-Armstrong & Nadel 2011, Mele 2015, and\nRoskies & Nahmias 2016.) And there are worries, arising from\ncertain versions of physicalism, that our mental states don\u2019t\nhave the causal powers we think they have (Kim 1998). But these\nthreats to free will have nothing to do with determinism. Determinism\nmight imply that our choices and efforts have earlier sufficient\ncauses; it does not imply that we don\u2019t make choices or that our\nchoices and efforts are causally impotent. Determinism is consistent\nwith the fact that our deliberation, choices and efforts are part of\nthe causal process whereby our bodies move and cause further effects\nin the world. And a cause is the kind of thing that \u201cmakes a\ndifference\u201d (Sartorio 2005, Menzies 2017, List 2019). If I raise\nmy hand because I chose to do so, then it\u2019s true, ceteris\nparibus, that if my choice had not occurred, my hand-raising\nwould not have occurred.\n\nPutting aside this worry, we may classify arguments for\nincompatibilism as falling into one of two main varieties:\n\nArguments for the claim that determinism would make it impossible\nfor us to cause and control our actions in the right kind of\nway.\nArguments for the claim that determinism would deprive us of the\npower or ability to do or choose otherwise.\n\n\nArguments of the first kind focus on the notions of self, causation,\nand responsibility; the worry is that determinism rules out the kind\nof causation that we invoke when we attribute actions to persons\n(\u201cIt was Suzy who broke the vase\u201d) and make judgments of\nmoral responsibility (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her fault; Billy pushed\nher\u201d). Someone who argues for incompatibilism in this way may\nconcede that the truth of determinism is consistent with the causal\nefficacy of our deliberation, choices, and attempts to act. But, she\ninsists, determinism implies that the only sense in which we\nare responsible for what we do is the sense in which a dog or young\nchild is responsible. Moral responsibility requires something more\nthan this, she believes. Moral responsibility requires autonomy or\nself-determination: that our actions are caused and controlled by, and\nonly by, our selves. To use a slogan popular in the\nliterature: We act freely and are morally responsible only if\nwe are the ultimate source of our actions.\n\n\nEach of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved. In doing what we\ndo, we cause certain events to happen, and nothing\u2014or no\none\u2014causes us to cause these events to happen. (Chisholm 1964:\n32)\n\nFree will\u2026is the power of agents to be the ultimate creators or\noriginators and sustainers of their own ends or purposes\u2026when\nwe trace the causal or explanatory chains of action back to their\nsources in the purposes of free agents, these causal chains must come\nto an end or terminate in the willings (choices, decisions, or\nefforts) of the agents, which cause or bring about their purposes.\n(Kane 1996: 4)\n\n\nArguments of the second kind focus on the notion of choice. To have a\nchoice, it seems, is to have genuine options or\nalternatives\u2014different ways in which we can act. The worry is\nthat determinism entails that what we do is, always, the only\nthing we can do, and that because of this we never really\nhave a choice about anything, as opposed to being under the\n(perhaps inescapable) illusion that we have a choice. Someone who\nargues for incompatibilism in this way may concede that the truth of\ndeterminism is consistent with our making choices, at least in the\nsense in which a dog or young child makes choices, and consistent also\nwith our choices being causally effective. But, she insists, this is\nnot enough for free will; we have free will only if we have a genuine\nchoice about what actions we perform, and we have a genuine choice\nonly if there is more than one action we are able to\nperform.\n\n\nA person has free will if he is often in positions like these: he must\nnow speak or be silent, and he can now speak and can\nnow remain silent; he must attempt to rescue a drowning child or else\ngo for help, and he is able to attempt to rescue the child\nand able to go for help; he must now resign his chairmanship\nor else lie to the members; and he has it within his power to resign\nand he has it within his power to lie. (van Inwagen 1983: 8)\n\n\nvan Inwagen is giving what he takes to be uncontroversial examples of\npersons who have free will; he isn\u2019t saying that free will just\nis the ability to perform more than one overt action. Our\nchoices include choices among purely mental actions (to pay attention\nto a lecture or to spend the time deciding what to cook for dinner) as\nwell as choices about the actions we perform by moving our bodies. If\nthe incompatibilist claims that determinism robs us of free will by\nrobbing us of choice, this must be understood as the claim that\ndeterminism has the consequence that we are never able to do\nanything other than what we actually do, where\n\u201cdo\u201d includes deciding, choosing, and other instances of\nmental agency as well as the things we do by moving our bodies.\n\nWe might question whether arguments based on self-determination and\narguments based on choice are independent ways of arguing for\nincompatibilism for the following reason: I cause and control my\nactions in the self-determining way required for moral responsibility\nonly if my actions are the product of my free will and my actions are\nthe product of my free will only if I have the ability to do (choose\nto do, decide to do, intend to do, try to do) otherwise. If\ndeterminism has the consequence that I never have the ability\nto do otherwise, it also has the consequence that I never cause my\nactions in the self-determining way required for moral responsibility\n(Kane 1996).\n\nAt one time, this link between moral responsibility,\nself-determination, and the ability to do otherwise was common ground\nbetween compatibilists and incompatibilists. That is, everyone agreed\nthat a person is morally responsible only if she has the right kind of\ncontrol over what she does, and everyone assumed that a\nperson has the right kind of control over something she does only if\nshe is able to do (or at least decide, choose, intend, or try)\notherwise. Given this assumption, anyone hoping to defend the\nclaim that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism had to\nfirst show that the ability to do otherwise is compatible with\ndeterminism. During the heyday of ordinary language philosophy in the\nmiddle years of the last century, there was a further assumption: that\nthe ability to do otherwise is compatible with determinism only if\nsentences like \u201c\\(S\\) could have done \\(X\\)\u201d (where \\(X\\)\nis something \\(S\\) did not do) were equivalent in meaning to\ncounterfactual conditionals like \u201cif \\(S\\) had chosen (or tried,\nwanted, preferred, etc.) to do \\(X\\), \\(S\\) would have done\n\\(X\\)\u201d. This debate was crippled by the fact that it took place\nat a time when counterfactuals were still poorly understood, before\nthe advent of the Lewis-Stalnaker possible worlds semantics (D. Lewis\n1973). There were counterexamples to the analyses proposed, and there\nwas a growing consensus that the prospects for a successful\n\u201cConditional Analysis\u201d were dim (Austin 1956; Chisholm\n1964; Lehrer 1968 and 1976). (For an argument that this pessimism was\npremature, see Vihvelin 2004 and 2013. For an argument that a\ncompatibilist doesn\u2019t need to defend a Conditional Analysis, see\nLehrer 1976.)\n\nIt was against this background that Harry Frankfurt proposed his\nfamous counterexample to the \u201cPrinciple of Alternate\nPossibilities\u201d (a person is morally responsible for what he has\ndone only if he could have done otherwise). Frankfurt wanted to defend\nthe claim that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism\nwithout having to defend the claim that the ability to do otherwise is\ncompatible with determinism. His strategy took the form of an\ningenious thought experiment that was supposed to show that no matter\nhow you understand ability to do otherwise\u2014whether you are a\ncompatibilist or an incompatibilist\u2014you should agree that the\npossession of this ability is not a necessary condition of being\nmorally responsible (Frankfurt 1969).\n\nThere were two steps to the thought experiment. In the first step he\ninvited you to imagine a person, Jones, who has free will, and who\nacts freely and who satisfies all the conditions you think necessary\nand sufficient for moral responsibility. You may imagine Jones in one\nof the scenarios van Inwagen describes, faced with a choice to speak\nor be silent, to try to rescue the child or go for help, to resign his\nchairmanship or to lie, and to imagine that Jones deliberates and\ndecides, for his own reasons, in favor of one of his contemplated\nalternatives, and then successfully acts on his decision. In the\nsecond step you are invited to add to the story the existence of a\npowerful being, Black, who takes a great interest in what Jones does,\nincluding how he deliberates and decides. You may fill in the details\nhowever you like, but you must imagine that Black has the power to\ninterfere with Jones in a way that ensures that Jones does\nexactly what Black wants him to do. And you must also imagine\nthat Black is paying very close attention and is prepared to intervene\ninstantly, should it be necessary, to stop Jones from doing something\nBlack doesn\u2019t want him to do. But, as it turns out, it\nwasn\u2019t necessary. By lucky co-incidence, Jones did exactly what\nBlack wanted him to do. (He even deliberated and decided the way Black\nwanted him to deliberate and decide.) So Black remained on the\nsidelines and only watched.\n\nBecause Black never laid a finger on Jones, or interfered in any way,\nit seems that Jones is as morally responsible in the second step of\nthe story as he is in the first step. But it also seems that the\nexistence of the powerful Black suffices to make it the case that\nJones is unable to do otherwise (or, as Frankfurt put it, that he\nlacks \u201calternate possibilities\u201d.)\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s story has strong intuitive force, and many were\nconvinced that it shows that we were mistaken when we thought that a\nperson has the right kind of control over what she does\u2014the kind\nof control that is necessary for moral responsibility\u2014only if\nshe is able to do otherwise. These philosophers, who later became\nknown as \u201cSource\u201d compatibilists or\n\u201csemi-compatibilists\u201d, took the moral to be that it is not\nrelevant, so far as moral responsibility is concerned,\nwhether determinism has the consequence that we don\u2019t have the\nfree will we think we have, that we never have any genuine choices,\nthat we are never able to do otherwise. They said that what matters,\nso far as moral responsibility is concerned, is only what happens in\nthe \u201cactual sequence\u201d (Fischer 1994; Fischer & Ravizza\n1998; Sartorio 2016).\n\nBut a little reflection should make us wonder whether facts about the\n\u201cactual sequence\u201d can come apart from facts about free\nwill in the way envisaged by Frankfurt. How can it be true that Black\nsucceeds, not just in limiting the range of Jones\u2019\nalternative courses of action, but in making it the case that Jones\nhas no alternatives? How can Black, sitting on the sidelines,\ndeprive Jones of the ability to deliberate, decide, or try\notherwise?\n\nWe can easily grant that Black has the power to directly manipulate\nJones\u2019 body so Jones loses the ability to move his body in any\nway other than the ways that Black wants. We might even grant that\nBlack has the power to directly manipulate Jones\u2019 mind/brain, so\nJones loses the ability to \u201cmove\u201d his mind in any way\nother than the ways that Black wants. But Black never exercises his\npower. There is a difference between the existence of a power\nand the exercise of a power. It is a modal fallacy to reason\nfrom \u201cBlack has the power to bring it about that Jones lacks the\nability to do otherwise\u201d to \u201cJones lacks the ability to do\notherwise\u201d. The truth about Jones is not that Black robs him of\nthe ability to do otherwise; it is the more complicated truth that\nBlack puts him at constant risk of losing the ability to do\notherwise. Jones\u2019 free will and his moral responsibility are\ndependent on the luck of his deliberations and intentions\nco-coinciding with those of Black (Vihvelin 2013; for some other\ncriticisms of Frankfurt\u2019s argument see Lamb 1993, Alvarez 2009,\nand Steward 2009).\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s argument has been enormously influential, though\nperhaps not in the way he intended. His thought experiment was a\nfailure; while most compatibilists were convinced, most\nincompatibilists were not. (Compatibilists who were not convinced\ninclude Smith 1997, 2004; Campbell 2005; Fara 2008; Vihvelin 2000 and\n2013.) These incompatibilists insisted, though not for the reason\ngiven above, that Black does not succeed in robbing Jones of all his\nfreedom; there is something that remains up to Jones\n(Widerker 1995; Ginet 1996; Kane 1996). This response, famously dubbed\nthe \u201cflickers of freedom\u201d reply, was criticized by\ndefenders of Frankfurt\u2019s argument on the ground that the\n\u201calternative possibilities\u201d retained by Jones are not\nsufficiently \u201crobust\u201d (Fischer 1994, 2003; Fischer &\nRavizza 1998). The critics of the argument rejected this charge,\narguing that Jones retains a morally relevant ability to do otherwise,\nthus resurrecting the very debate that Frankfurt had hoped to\nundermine. Other defenders of Frankfurt\u2019s argument told more\ncomplicated stories and argued that, even if Frankfurt\u2019s story\ndoes not succeed, these new stories show that a person may be morally\nresponsible for her action despite lacking any ability to do\notherwise (Mele & Robb 1998; Pereboom 2003). More than fifty years\nafter the publication of Frankfurt\u2019s article, the debate\ncontinues. For a sample of some of this vast literature, see Widerker\n& McKenna 2003.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s aim was to make it easier to defend the claim that\nmoral responsibility is compatible with determinism and there\nis a case to be made that he was successful or, at least, successful\nagainst the \u201cSource\u201d incompatibilists who were convinced\nby his argument (Fischer 2003, Sartorio 2016). But there has been a\ncost. Our interest in free will is not limited to our interest in\nmoral responsibility. Compatibilism has historically been charged with\nbeing \u201ca wretched subterfuge\u201d and a \u201cquagmire of\nevasion\u201d. Determinism seems prima facie incompatible with\ngenuine choice and the ability to do otherwise, and while there was a\ntime when the philosophical consensus was that the incompatibilist is\nguilty of some simple confusion or mistake akin to the\nfatalist\u2019s mistake, this is no longer the case, thanks to the\nConsequence argument (to be discussed later). The influence of\nFrankfurt\u2019s argument (and his other essays, especially Frankfurt\n1971) has been so great that most compatibilists have turned their\nattention away from the free will/determinism problem and focused\nexclusively on problems about moral responsibility (and related\ntopics, like blame, desert, and punishment). The term\n\u2018compatibilism\u2019 is now often used to refer to a thesis\nabout moral responsibility\u2014that the freedom sufficient for moral\nresponsibility is compatible with determinism (Pereboom 1995), that\nthe existence of actions free in the sense required for moral\nresponsibility is compatible with determinism (Markosian 1999), that\nthe unique ability of persons to exercise control in the manner\nnecessary for moral responsibility is compatible with determinism\n(McKenna 2004b [2015]). The literature on the traditional problem of\nfree will and determinism is dominated by incompatibilists. There is a\ngrowing consensus that the incompatibilist is right: if our universe\nis a deterministic one, we never have the ability to choose and do\nanything other than what we actually do.\n\nBefore we ask whether this pessimism about the compatibility of free\nwill with determinism is warranted, we should pause to ask whether\nthere really is a substantive disagreement between compatibilists and\nincompatibilists. When an incompatibilist says that determinism would\nrob us of the free will we think we have, including genuine choices\nand the ability to do otherwise, and when the compatibilist denies\nthis, are they asserting and denying the same proposition? Or is the\nincompatibilist asserting one thing while the compatibilist is denying\nsomething else?\n\nSome of the things said in the literature suggest that there is no\nsubstantive debate. For instance, some philosophers contrast a\n\u201cstrong incompatibilist ability\u201d with a \u201cweak\ncompatibilist ability\u201d (or \u201clibertarian free will\u201d\nwith \u201ccompatibilist free will\u201d) and write in a way that\nsuggests that they think that the only substantive question about free\nwill is whether it is or entails the \u201cstrong\u201d\nincompatibilist ability to do otherwise (since the \u201cweak\u201d\ncompatibilist ability to do otherwise is, by definition,\ncompatible with determinism). And one leading semantic proposal might\nseem to support the claim that there is no real dispute. According to\nthe Lewis/Kratzer, proposal \u2018can\u2019 (and other modal words,\nincluding \u2018is able\u2019, \u2018has the power\u2019,\n\u2018is free to\u2019) means \u2018compossible with relevant facts\nF\u2019, and the relevant facts are determined by the context\ntogether with the intentions of the speaker (D. Lewis 1976, Kratzer\n1977). For a different kind of contextualist proposal see Hawthorne\n2001; for criticism, see Feldman 2004. Whittle 2021 is a book-length\ndefense of a contextualist account of freedom and responsibility.\n\nSo, for instance, it might be true, given one context, that I can\nspeak Finnish (I\u2019m a native Estonian speaker, so it\nwouldn\u2019t take that long for me to learn Finnish) and false,\ngiven another context (don\u2019t take me to Finland as your\ninterpreter). There is no contradiction in saying that I both can and\ncan\u2019t speak Finnish, so long as we understand that what we are\nsaying is that my speaking Finnish is compossible with one set of\nfacts (my ability to easily learn the language) and not compossible\nwith another, more inclusive set of facts (my current inability to\nspeak it). Given this understanding of \u2018can, it might seem that\nthere is no genuine disagreement between the compatibilist and the\nincompatibilist. When the compatibilist asserts that deterministic\nagents are often able to do otherwise, she has in mind contexts (the\ncontexts of ordinary speakers, in daily life) in which the relevant\nfacts \\(F\\) are restricted to some relatively local facts\nabout the agent and her surroundings. When the incompatibilist denies\nthat any deterministic agent is ever able to do otherwise, she has in\nmind contexts (the contexts of philosophers discussing the free\nwill/determinism problem) in which the relevant facts include all\nthe facts about the laws and the past. So the proposition denied\nby the incompatibilist is not the proposition asserted by the\ncompatibilist.\n\nThe leading contemporary incompatibilist, van Inwagen, rejects any\nsuggestion that the compatibilist and the incompatibilist have a\nmerely verbal disagreement, either because they are using different\nsenses of \u2018can\u2019 (\u2018ability\u2019,\n\u2018power\u2019, \u201cfree will\u201d etc.) or because they are\nfocusing on different contexts of utterance. The debate, he says, is\nabout whether determinism has the consequence that no one is ever able\nto do otherwise (equivalently, that no one ever has it in their power\nto do otherwise) given what ordinary speakers mean, in the\ncontexts in which they use these words. The contexts to which he is\nreferring are the contexts of deliberation and choice in which we\nconsider our options, while believing that we are able to pursue each\nof them. When a compatibilist asserts, and an incompatibilist denies,\nthat a person at a deterministic world is sometimes able to do\notherwise, they mean exactly the same thing by \u2018is able\nto\u2019; they mean what ordinary English speakers mean (in these\ncontexts). The proposition asserted by the compatibilist is the\nproposition denied by the incompatibilist. Citing David Lewis as his\nexample of a compatibilist opponent, van Inwagen says that he and\nLewis cannot both be right. One of them is wrong, but neither is\nmuddled or making a simple mistake (van Inwagen 2008).\n\nIn what follows, we will assume that the debate about free will\n(including, but not necessarily limited to, genuine choice and the\nability to do otherwise) and determinism is a substantive debate, and\nnot one that can be dissolved by appeal to different senses or\ncontexts of utterance. We will now turn to the arguments.\n",
