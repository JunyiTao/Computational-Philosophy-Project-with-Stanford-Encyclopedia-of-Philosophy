    "main_text": "The Perfection of the Philosophy of Nature\n7. The Perfection of the Philosophy of Nature\n\n\nNatural philosophy has to know and teach the very essence of natural\nbeings. First, it has to deal with their basic principles, such as\nmatter and motion, which are not natural beings themselves. These\nprinciples of natural philosophy are discussed in Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics. Moreover, natural philosophy has to deal with the\naccidents of natural beings understood through their causes. These are\nthe subject of Aristotle\u2019s other writings on nature, from On the\nHeavens to On the Soul (on Zabarella\u2019s ideas\non Physics, see Biard 2005).\n\n\nIn De naturalis scientiae constitutione, the first treatise\nin his collected works on natural philosophy (De rebus\nnaturalibus), Zabarella deals in detail with the questions of the\norder and perfection of the natural sciences. He claims, for example,\nthat the book on minerals is necessary because the natural philosophy\nwould otherwise be incomplete. The place of the book on minerals in\nAristotelian corpus on natural philosophy is immediately\nafter the book On Meteorology. Whether Aristotle himself\nwrote on minerals is questionable, but he at least recognized the\nimportance of the subject. However, later both Theophrastus and\nAlbertus Magnus wrote on this important subject. Thus Zabarella did\nnot consider Aristotle\u2019s works as a complete corpus to which\nnothing could be added. In De methodis Zabarella states that\nAristotle wrote on subjects of his own choice, but it would be an\nexaggeration to claim that he was incapable of making\nmistakes. Aristotle was not infallible and it would be erroneous to\ninsist that he knew the truth of everything he wrote. Nevertheless, he\nwas an outstanding scholar in Zabarella\u2019s view, who, for example,\nturned the study of logic into a discipline.\n\n\nIn the last chapter of De naturalis scientiae constitutione\nZabarella discusses the question of the perfection of the natural\nsciences (De perfectione scientiae naturalis ac de eius\nordine). Zabarella states that Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature\nmay be perfect in structure and form, but it is incomplete in terms of\nits reference to natural beings. There is much Aristotle did not\ndiscuss at all and indeed much that was outside his cognisance.\nAlthough he dealt comparatively little with plants and animals, it is\nnot difficult to pinpoint their proper palces in the Aristotelian\nsystem of the natural sciences. Therefore Zabarella emphasizes that\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature is complete at least in theory.\nZabarella compares Aristotle\u2019s works on natural philosophy to the\ngeometry and arithmetic of Euclid. There are many theorems which can\nbe demonstrated from his works even if he did not himself actually\nwrite them. For Zabarella this is no reason to judge Euclid\u2019s geometry\nor arithmetic defective or incomplete. If Euclid had wished, he could\nhave demonstrated all the particular cases, but his book would have\nbecome so enormous that it surely would have daunted the reader.\nZabarella suggests that this is exactly why Euclid entitled his book\nThe Elements, and from this foundation all the other theorems\ncan be demonstrated.\n\n\nIn parallel view Zabarella thinks that Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy\ncan be called perfect, since it deals with all the knowledge that is\npossible for human intellect to obtain, either in practice or at least\nin theory. Also in his logical works Zabarella emphasizes the idea of\na perfect natural philosophy, which consists of a perfect and distinct\nknowledge of natural beings through their causes. Zabarella reminds\nthat scientific knowledge can never be called confused or\nimperfect. Therefore the scientific ideal Zabarella presents is\nprofoundly different from the modern view of a scientist making new\ndiscoveries. According to Zabarella, science can be \u201cnew\u201d\nonly in a restricted sense; the work of a scientist is more like\ncorrecting the mistakes and filling the gaps in a ready-made\nAristotelian world-system (Mikkeli 1992; 1997, pp. 214\u2013215; 2010,\np. 189)\n",
