    "main_text": "Morality || The \u201cInjustice\u201d of Capitalism\n5.2 The \u201cInjustice\u201d of Capitalism\n\nThe initial argument that Marx must have thought that capitalism is\nunjust is based on the observation that Marx argued that all\ncapitalist profit is ultimately derived from the exploitation of the\nworker. Capitalism\u2019s dirty secret is that it is not a realm of\nharmony and mutual benefit but a system in which one class\nsystematically extracts profit from another. How could this fail to be\nunjust? Yet it is notable that Marx never explicitly draws such a\nconclusion, and in Capital he goes as far as to say that such\nexchange is \u201cby no means an injury to the seller\u201d (MECW\n35: 204), which some commentators have taken as evidence that Marx did\nnot think that capitalism was unjust, although other readings are\npossible.\n\nAllen Wood (1972) is perhaps the leading advocate of the view that\nMarx did not believe that capitalism is unjust. Wood argues that Marx\ntakes this approach because his general theoretical approach excludes\nany trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment on the justice\nof an economic system. Even though it is acceptable to criticise\nparticular behaviour from within an economic structure as unjust (and\ntheft under capitalism would be an example) it is not possible to\ncriticise capitalism as a whole. This is a consequence of Marx\u2019s\nanalysis of the role of ideas of justice from within historical\nmaterialism. Marx claims that juridical institutions are part of the\nsuperstructure, and that ideas of justice are\nideological. Accordingly, the role of both the superstructure and\nideology, in the functionalist reading of historical materialism\nadopted here, is to stabilise the economic structure. Consequently, to\nstate that something is just under capitalism is simply a judgement\nthat it will tend to have the effect of advancing capitalism.\nAccording to Marx, in any society the ruling ideas are those of the\nruling class; the core of the theory of ideology.\n\nZiyad Husami (1978) however, argues that Wood is mistaken,\nignoring the fact that for Marx ideas undergo a double determination.\nWe need to differentiate not just by economic system, but also by\neconomic class within the system. Therefore the ideas of the\nnon-ruling class may be very different from those of the ruling class.\nOf course, it is the ideas of the ruling class that receive attention\nand implementation, but this does not mean that other ideas do not\nexist. Husami goes as far as to argue that members of the proletariat\nunder capitalism have an account of justice that matches communism.\nFrom this privileged standpoint of the proletariat, which is also\nMarx\u2019s standpoint, capitalism is unjust, and so it follows that\nMarx thought capitalism unjust.\n\nPlausible though it may sound, Husami\u2019s argument fails to\naccount for two related points. First, it cannot explain why Marx\nnever explicitly described capitalism as unjust, and second, it\noverlooks the distance Marx wanted to place between his own scientific\nsocialism, and that of other socialists who argued for the injustice\nof capitalism. Hence one cannot avoid the conclusion that the\n\u201cofficial\u201d view of Marx is that capitalism is not\nunjust.\n\nNevertheless, this leaves us with a puzzle. Much of Marx\u2019s\ndescription of capitalism\u2014his use of the words\n\u201cembezzlement\u201d, \u201crobbery\u201d and\n\u201cexploitation\u201d\u2014belie the official account. Arguably,\nthe only satisfactory way of understanding this issue is, once more,\nfrom G.A. Cohen, who proposes that Marx believed that capitalism was\nunjust, but did not believe that he believed it was unjust (Cohen\n1983). In other words, Marx, like so many of us, did not have perfect\nknowledge of his own mind. In his explicit reflections on the justice\nof capitalism he was able to maintain his official view. But in less\nguarded moments his real view slips out, even if never in explicit\nlanguage. Such an interpretation is bound to be controversial, but it\nmakes good sense of the texts.\n\nWhatever one concludes on the question of whether Marx thought\ncapitalism unjust, it is, nevertheless, obvious that Marx thought that\ncapitalism was not the best way for human beings to live. Points made\nin his early writings remain present throughout his writings, if no\nlonger connected to an explicit theory of alienation. The worker finds\nwork a torment, suffers poverty, overwork and lack of fulfilment and\nfreedom. People do not relate to each other as humans should. Does\nthis amount to a moral criticism of capitalism or not? In the absence\nof any special reason to argue otherwise, it simply seems obvious that\nMarx\u2019s critique is a moral one. Capitalism impedes human\nflourishing. It is hard to disagree with the judgement that Marx\n\n\nthinks that the capitalist exploitation of labor power is a wrong that\nhas horrendous consequences for the laborers. (Roberts 2017: 129)\n\n\nMarx, though, once more refrained from making this explicit; he seemed\nto show no interest in locating his criticism of capitalism in any of\nthe traditions of moral philosophy, or explaining how he was\ngenerating a new tradition. There may have been two reasons for his\ncaution. The first was that while there were bad things about\ncapitalism, there is, from a world historical point of view, much good\nabout it too. For without capitalism, communism would not be possible.\nCapitalism is to be transcended, not abolished, and this may be\ndifficult to convey in the terms of moral philosophy.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, we need to return to the\ncontrast between Marxian and other forms of socialism. Many\nnon-Marxian socialists appealed to universal ideas of truth and\njustice to defend their proposed schemes, and their theory of\ntransition was based on the idea that appealing to moral sensibilities\nwould be the best, perhaps only, way of bringing about the new chosen\nsociety. Marx wanted to distance himself from these other socialist\ntraditions, and a key point of distinction was to argue that the route\nto understanding the possibilities of human emancipation lay in the\nanalysis of historical and social forces, not in morality. Hence, for\nMarx, any appeal to morality was theoretically a backward step.\n",
