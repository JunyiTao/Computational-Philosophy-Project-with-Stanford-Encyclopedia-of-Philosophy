Empathy, intersubjectivity and lifeworld; ethics and value theory\n\nOne of the main themes of transcendental phenomenology is\nintersubjectivity. Among other things, it is discussed in considerable\ndetail in the 5th of the Cartesian Meditations and\nin the manuscripts published in vol. XIII\u2013XV of Husserliana\n(see Kern 2019 for an overview). (A particularly\nimportant critique of Husserl\u2019s view on intersubjectivity from a\nsociological viewpoint is found in Sch\u00fctz 1966.)\n\nAccording to Husserl, intersubjective experience plays a fundamental\nrole in our constitution of both ourselves as objectively existing\nsubjects, other experiencing subjects, and the objective\nspatio-temporal world. Transcendental phenomenology attempts to\nreconstruct the rational structures underlying\u2014and making\npossible\u2014these constitutive achievements.\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, intersubjectivity comes in when we\nundergo acts of empathy. Intersubjective experience is\nempathic experience; it occurs in the course of our conscious\nattribution of intentional acts to other subjects, in the course of\nwhich we put ourselves into the other one\u2019s shoes. In order to\nstudy this kind of experience from the phenomenological attitude, we\nmust bracket our belief in the existence of the respective target of\nour act-ascription qua experiencing subject and ask ourselves\nwhich of our further beliefs justify that existence-belief as well as\nour act-ascription. It is these further beliefs that make up the\nrational structure underlying our intersubjective experience. Since it\ntakes phenomenological investigation to lay bare these beliefs, they\nmust be first and foremost unconscious when we experience the world in\nthe natural attitude.\n\nAmong the fundamental beliefs thus uncovered by Husserl is the belief\n(or expectation) that a being that looks and behaves more or less like\nmyself, i.e., displays traits more or less familiar from my own case,\nwill generally perceive things from an egocentric viewpoint\nsimilar to my own (\u201chere\u201d, \u201cover there\u201d,\n\u201cto my left\u201d, \u201cin front of me\u201d, etc.), in the\nsense that I would roughly look upon things the way he does if I were\nin his shoes and perceived them from his perspective. This belief\nallows me to ascribe intentional acts to others immediately or\n\u201cappresentatively\u201d, i.e., without having to draw an\ninference, say, by analogy with my own case. So the belief in question\nmust lie quite at the bedrock of my belief-system. It forms a part of\nthe already pregiven (and generally unreflected) intentional\nbackground, or \u201clifeworld\u201d (cf. Crisis), against\nwhich my practice of act-ascription and all constitutive achievements\nbased upon that practice make sense in the first place, and in terms\nof which they get their ultimate justification.\n\nHusserl\u2019s notion of lifeworld is a difficult (and at the same\ntime important) one. It can roughly be thought of in two different\n(but arguably compatible) ways: (1) in terms of belief and (2) in\nterms of something like socially, culturally or evolutionarily\nestablished (but nevertheless abstract) sense or meaning.\n\n(1) If we restrict ourselves to a single subject of experience, the\nlifeworld can be looked upon as the rational structure underlying his\n(or her) \u201cnatural attitude\u201d. That is to say: a given\nsubject\u2019s lifeworld consists of the beliefs against which his\neveryday attitude towards himself, the objective world and others\nreceive their ultimate justification. (However, in principle not even\nbeliefs forming part of a subject\u2019s lifeworld are immune to\nrevision. Hence, Husserl must not be regarded as an epistemological\nfoundationalist; see F\u00f8llesdal 1988.)\n\n(2a) If we consider a single community of subjects, their common\nlifeworld, or \u201chomeworld\u201d, can be looked upon, by first\napproximation, as the system of senses or meanings constituting their\ncommon language, or \u201cform of life\u201d (Wittgenstein), given\nthat they conceive of the world and themselves in the categories\nprovided by this language.\n\n(2b) If we consider subjects belonging to different communities, we\ncan look upon their common lifeworld as the general framework, or\n\u201ca priori structure\u201d, of senses or meanings that allows\nfor the mutual translation of their respective languages (with their\ndifferent associated \u201chomeworlds\u201d) into one another.\n\nThe term \u201clifeworld\u201d thus denotes the way the members of\none or more social groups (cultures, linguistic communities) use to\nstructure the world into objects (Husserliana, vol. VI, pp.\n126\u2013138, 140\u2013145). The respective lifeworld is claimed to\n\u201cpredelineate\u201d a \u201cworld-horizon\u201d of potential\nfuture experiences that are to be (more or less) expected for a given\ngroup member at a given time, under various conditions, where the\nresulting sequences of anticipated experiences can be looked upon as\ncorresponding to different \u201cpossible worlds and\nenvironments\u201d (Husserliana, vol. III/1, p. 100). These\nexpectations follow typical patterns, as the lifeworld is fixed by a\nsystem of (first and foremost implicit) intersubjective standards, or\nconventions, that determine what counts as \u201cnormal\u201d or\n\u201cstandard\u201d observation under \u201cnormal\u201d\nconditions (Husserliana, vol. XV, pp. 135 ff, 142) and thus\nas a source of epistemic justification. Some of these standards are\nrestricted to a particular culture or \u201chomeworld\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. XV, pp. 141 f, 227\u2013236), whereas\nothers determine a \u201cgeneral structure\u201d that is \u201ca\npriori\u201d in being \u201cunconditionally valid for all\nsubjects\u201d, defining \u201cthat on which normal Europeans,\nnormal Hindus, Chinese, etc., agree in spite of all relativity\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. VI, p. 142). Husserl quotes universally\naccepted facts about \u201cspatial shape, motion,\nsense-quality\u201d as well as our prescientific notions of\n\u201cspatiotemporality\u201d, \u201cbody\u201d and\n\u201ccausality\u201d as examples (ibid.). These conceptions\ndetermine the general structure of all particular thing-concepts that\nare such that any creature sharing the essential structures of\nintentional consciousness will be capable of forming and grasping\nthem, respectively, under different lifeworldly conditions.\n\nThe notion of lifeworld was already introduced in the posthumously\npublished second volume of Ideas, under the heading of\n\u201cUmwelt\u201d, to be translated as \u201csurrounding\nworld\u201d or \u201cenvironment\u201d. Husserl there characterizes\nthe environment as a world of entities that are\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d to us in that they exercise\n\u201cmotivating\u201d force on us and present themselves to us\nunder egocentric aspects. Any subject taking the \u201cpersonalistic\nattitude\u201d builds the center of an environment containing such\nobjects. The personalistic attitude is \u201cthe attitude we are\nalways in when we live with one another, talk to one another, shake\nhands with one another in greeting, or are related to one another in\nlove and aversion, in disposition and action, in discourse and\ndiscussion\u201d (Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 183; Husserl\n1989, p. 192). The central notion of Husserl\u2019s\n\u201cUmweltanalyse\u201d is the concept of motivation, whose\napplication he explains as follows: \u201chow did I hit upon that,\nwhat brought me to it? That questions like these can be raised\ncharacterizes all motivation in general\u201d (Husserliana,\nvol. IV, p. 222; Husserl 1989, p. 234, with translation change). The\nentities exercising motivating force on us owe their corresponding\n\u201cmeaning\u201d or significance to certain forms of intentional\nconsciousness and intersubjective processes. Thus, to quote one of\nHusserl\u2019s examples, \u201cI see coal as heating material; I\nrecognize it and recognize it as useful and as used for heating, as\nappropriate for and as destined to produce warmth. [...] I can use [a\ncombustible object] as fuel; it has value for me as a possible source\nof heat. That is, it has value for me with respect to the fact that\nwith it I can produce the heating of a room and thereby pleasant\nsensations of warmth for myself and others. [...] Others also\napprehend it in the same way, and it acquires an intersubjective\nuse-value and in a social context is appreciated and is valuable as\nserving such and such a purpose, as useful to man, etc.\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. IV, pp. 186f; Husserl 1989, pp. 196f).\n\nOn Husserl\u2019s view, it is precisely this\n\u201csubjective-relative lifeworld\u201d, or environment, that\nprovides the \u201cgrounding soil\u201d of the more objective world\nof science (Husserliana, vol. VI, p. 134), in the twofold\nsense that (i) scientific conceptions owe their (sub-)propositional\ncontent and thus their reference to reality to the prescientific\nnotions they are supposed to \u201cnaturalize\u201d and that,\nconsequently, (ii) when things get into flux in science, when a crisis\noccurs, all that is left to appeal to in order to defend new\nscientific approaches against their rivals is the prescientific\nlifeworld, as manifested in our according intuitive acceptances (for\nreferences cf. F\u00f8llesdal 1990a, pp. 139f). This view offers an\nalternative to the \u201cnaturalistic\u201d stance taken by many\nanalytic philosophers today.\n\nOne of the constitutive achievements based upon my lifeworldly\ndetermined practice of act-ascription is my self-image as a\nfull-fledged person existing as a psycho-physical element of the\nobjective, spatio-temporal order. This self-image can be justified by\nwhat Edith Stein, in a PhD thesis on empathy supervised by Husserl\n(Stein 1917), has labelled as iterated empathy, where I put\nmyself into the other subject\u2019s shoes, i.e., (consciously)\nsimulate him, under the aspect that he (or she) in turn puts himself\ninto my shoes. In this way, I can figure out that in order\nfor the other subject to be able to ascribe intentional acts to me, he\nhas to identify me bodily, as a flesh-and-blood human being,\nwith its egocentric viewpoint necessarily differing from his own. This\nbrings home to me that my egocentric perspective is just one among\nmany, and that from all foreign perspectives I appear as a physical\nobject among others in a spatio-temporal world. So the following\ncriterion of subject-identity at a given time applies both to myself\nand to others: one human living body, one experiencing subject.\nHowever, Husserl does not at all want to deny that we also ascribe\nexperiences, even intentional ones, to non-human animals. This becomes\nthe more difficult and problematic, though, the less bodily and\nbehavioural similarity obtains between them and ourselves.\n\nBefore finally turning to the question of what\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d amounts to in this connection, let us notice\nthat in Husserl\u2019s eyes something like empathy also forms the\nbasis of both our practical, aesthetical and moral evaluations and of\nwhat might be called intercultural understanding, i.e., the\nconstitution of a \u201cforeign world\u201d against the background\nof one\u2019s own \u201chomeworld\u201d, i.e., one\u2019s own\nfamiliar (but, again, generally unreflected) cultural heritage (cf.\nHusserliana, vol. XV). Husserl studied many of these\nphenomena in detail, and he even outlined the beginnings of a\nphenomenological ethics and value theory (cf. Husserliana,\nvol. XXVIII, XXXVII). In this context, he formulates a\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d that makes recourse to the notion\nof lifeworld, or environment, as follows: Always act in such a way\nthat your action contributes as well as possible to the best (the most\nvaluable) you recognize yourself to be able to achieve in your life,\ngiven your individual abilities and environment (cf.\nHusserliana, vol. XXXVII, pp. 251 ff). (This version of the\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d stems from Husserl\u2019s post-war\nlectures on ethics and value theory. Earlier versions differ\nsignificantly; for the development of Husserl\u2019s thought on this and\nrelated issues, see, e.g., Melle 1991; Peucker 2008; Donohoe 2016, ch.\n4; Drummond 2018; and Crespo 2021.)\n\nNote that on Husserl\u2019s view the will of a free agent, capable of\nfollowing this imperative, is always already embedded in a\n\u201cvolitional context\u201d predelineating the open \u201cfuture\nhorizon\u201d of a \u201cfull individual life\u201d that the agent\nis currently able to lead (Husserliana, vol. XXXVII, p. 252),\nthus qualifying as a dynamic intentional structure. This individual\nlife corresponds to the agent\u2018s self-determination as an\nindividual person (see Section 8 above). The valuings underlying this\nself-determination can be veridical, and thus suitable for motivating\nobjectively valid evaluative judgments, because their correlates, i.e.\nvalues, are part of the ideal (but still intersubjectively\nconstituted) spiritual world (Husserliana, vol XXXVI, pp. 217\nff). These values stand in hierarchical relations to each other,\ngoverned by laws to be studied in what Husserl calls formal axiology\n(ibid., pp. 226\u2013232). Value-perception in the form of emotional\nvaluing thus allows for a priori insights. It is such insights that\ndetermine the good will, in that the latter orients itself by the\nhighest values the subject, on reflection, including a priori\nreflection, based on emotion, recognizes him- or herself to be able to\nrealize in life, given his or her abilities and environment (for the\npresent paragraph cf. Beyer 2013, sec. 1; for more detailed analyses\nof Husserl\u2019s ethics and value theory see, e.g., Luft 2010, the\ncontributions to Luft, ed., 2011 and the literature cited there, as\nwell as the secondary literature cited at the end of the foregoing\nparagraph.)\n",
