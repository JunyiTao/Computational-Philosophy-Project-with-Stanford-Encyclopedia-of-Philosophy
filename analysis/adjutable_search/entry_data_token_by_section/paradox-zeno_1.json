    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Plurality || The Argument from Denseness\n2.1 The Argument from Denseness\n\nIf there are many, they must be as many as they are and neither more\nnor less than that. But if they are as many as they are, they would be\nlimited. If there are many, things that are are unlimited. For there\nare always others between the things that are, and again others\nbetween those, and so the things that are are unlimited.\n(Simplicius(a) On Aristotle\u2019s Physics, 140.29)\n\n\nThis first argument, given in Zeno\u2019s words according to\nSimplicius, attempts to show that there could not be more than one\nthing, on pain of contradiction: if there are many things, then they\nare both \u2018limited\u2019 and \u2018unlimited\u2019, a\ncontradiction. On the one hand, he says that any collection must\ncontain some definite number of things, or in his words\n\u2018neither more nor less\u2019. But if you have a definite number\nof things, he concludes, you must have a\nfinite\u2014\u2018limited\u2019\u2014number of them; in drawing\nthis inference he assumes that to have infinitely many things is to\nhave an indefinite number of them. On the other hand, imagine\nany collection of \u2018many\u2019 things arranged in\nspace\u2014picture them lined up in one dimension for definiteness.\nBetween any two of them, he claims, is a third; and in between these\nthree elements another two; and another four between these five; and\nso on without end. Therefore the collection is also\n\u2018unlimited\u2019. So our original assumption of a plurality\nleads to a contradiction, and hence is false: there are not many\nthings after all. At least, so Zeno\u2019s reasoning runs.\nLet us consider the two subarguments, in reverse order. First are\nthere \u2018always others between the things that are\u2019? (In\nmodern terminology, why must objects always be \u2018densely\u2019\nordered?) Suppose that we had imagined a collection of ten apples\nlined up; then there is indeed another apple between the sixth and\neighth, but there is none between the seventh and eighth! On the\nassumption that Zeno is not simply confused, what does he have in\nmind? The texts do not say, but here are two possibilities: first, one\nmight hold that for any pair of physical objects (two apples say) to\nbe two distinct objects and not just one (a\n\u2018double-apple\u2019) there must be a third between them,\nphysically separating them, even if it is just air. And one might\nthink that for these three to be distinct, there must be two more\nobjects separating them, and so on (this view presupposes that their\nbeing made of different substances is not sufficient to render them\ndistinct). So perhaps Zeno is arguing against plurality given a\ncertain conception of physical distinctness. But second, one might\nalso hold that any body has parts that can be densely\nordered. Of course 1/2s, 1/4s, 1/8s and so on of apples are not\ndense\u2014such parts may be adjacent\u2014but there may be\nsufficiently small parts\u2014call them\n\u2018point-parts\u2019\u2014that are. Indeed, if between any two\npoint-parts there lies a finite distance, and if point-parts can be\narbitrarily close, then they are dense; a third lies at the half-way\npoint of any two. In particular, familiar geometric points are like\nthis, and hence are dense. So perhaps Zeno is offering an argument\nregarding the divisibility of bodies. Either way, Zeno\u2019s assumption of\ndenseness requires some further assumption about the plurality in\nquestion, and correspondingly focusses the target of his paradox.\n\n\nBut suppose that one holds that some collection (the points in a line,\nsay) is dense, hence \u2018unlimited\u2019, or infinite. The first\nprong of Zeno\u2019s attack purports to show that because it contains a\ndefinite number of elements it is also \u2018limited\u2019, or\nfinite. Can this contradiction be escaped? The assumption that any\ndefinite number is finite seems intuitive, but we now know, thanks to\nthe work of Cantor in the Nineteenth century, how to understand\ninfinite numbers in a way that makes them just as definite as finite\nnumbers. The central element of this theory of the \u2018transfinite\nnumbers\u2019 is a precise definition of when two infinite\ncollections are the same size, and when one is bigger than the\nother. With such a definition in hand it is then possible to order the\ninfinite numbers just as the finite numbers are ordered: for example,\nthere are different, definite infinite numbers of fractions and\ngeometric points in a line, even though both are dense. (See Further\nReading below for references to introductions to these mathematical\nideas, and their history.) So contrary to Zeno\u2019s assumption, it is\nmeaningful to compare infinite collections with respect to the number\nof their elements, to say whether two have more than, or fewer than,\nor \u2018as many as\u2019 each other: there are, for instance, more\ndecimal numbers than whole numbers, but as many even numbers as whole\nnumbers. So mathematically, Zeno\u2019s reasoning is unsound when he says\nthat because a collection has a definite number, it must be finite,\nand the first subargument is fallacious. (Though of course that only\nshows that infinite collections are mathematically consistent, not\nthat any physically exist.)\n\n",
