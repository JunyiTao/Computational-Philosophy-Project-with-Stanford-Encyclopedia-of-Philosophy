    "main_text": "Models and Theory || Models as subsidiaries to theory\n4.1 Models as subsidiaries to theory\n\nTo discuss the relation between models and theories in science it is\nhelpful to briefly recapitulate the notions of a model and of a theory\nin logic. A theory is taken to be a (usually deductively\nclosed) set of sentences in a formal language. A model is a\nstructure (in the sense introduced in\n Section 2.3)\n that makes all sentences of a theory true when its symbols are\ninterpreted as referring to objects, relations, or functions of a\nstructure. The structure is a model of the theory in the\nsense that it is correctly described by the theory (see Bell and\nMachover 1977 or Hodges 1997 for details). Logical models are\nsometimes also referred to as \u201cmodels of theory\u201d to\nindicate that they are interpretations of an abstract formal\nsystem.\n\nModels in science sometimes carry over from logic the idea of being\nthe interpretation of an abstract calculus (Hesse 1967). This is\nsalient in physics, where general laws\u2014such as Newton\u2019s\nequation of motion\u2014lie at the heart of a theory. These laws are\napplied to a particular system\u2014e.g., a pendulum\u2014by\nchoosing a special force function, making assumptions about the mass\ndistribution of the pendulum etc. The resulting model then is an\ninterpretation (or realization) of the general law.\n\nIt is important to keep the notions of a logical and a\nrepresentational model separate (Thomson-Jones 2006): these are\ndistinct concepts. Something can be a logical model without being a\nrepresentational model, and vice versa. This, however, does\nnot mean that something cannot be a model in both senses at once. In\nfact, as Hesse (1967) points out, many models in science are both\nlogical and representational models. Newton\u2019s model of planetary\nmotion is a case in point: the model, consisting of two homogeneous\nperfect spheres located in otherwise empty space that attract each\nother gravitationally, is simultaneously a logical model (because it\nmakes the axioms of Newtonian mechanics true when they are interpreted\nas referring to the model) and a representational model (because it\nrepresents the real sun and earth).\n\nThere are two main conceptions of scientific theories, the so-called\nsyntactic view of theories and the so-called semantic view of theories\n(see the entry on\n the structure of scientific theories).\n On both conceptions models play a subsidiary role to theories, albeit\nin very different ways. The syntactic view of theories (see entry\nsection on\n the syntactic view)\n retains the logical notions of a model and a theory. It construes a\ntheory as a set of sentences in an axiomatized logical system, and a\nmodel as an alternative interpretation of a certain calculus\n(Braithwaite 1953; Campbell 1920 [1957]; Nagel 1961; Spector 1965).\nIf, for instance, we take the mathematics used in the kinetic theory\nof gases and reinterpret the terms of this calculus in a way that\nmakes them refer to billiard balls, the billiard balls are a model of\nthe kinetic theory of gases in the sense that all sentences of the\ntheory come out true. The model is meant to be something that we are\nfamiliar with, and it serves the purpose of making an abstract formal\ncalculus more palpable. A given theory can have different models, and\nwhich model we choose depends both on our aims and our background\nknowledge. Proponents of the syntactic view disagree about the\nimportance of models. Carnap and Hempel thought that models only serve\na pedagogic or aesthetic purpose and are ultimately dispensable\nbecause all relevant information is contained in the theory (Carnap\n1938; Hempel 1965; see also Bailer-Jones 1999). Nagel (1961) and\nBraithwaite (1953), on the other hand, emphasize the\nheuristic role of models, and Schaffner (1969) submits that\ntheoretical terms get at least part of their meaning from models.\n\nThe semantic view of theories (see entry section on\n the semantic view)\n dispenses with sentences in an axiomatized logical system and\nconstrues a theory as a family of models. On this view, a theory\nliterally is a class, cluster, or family of models\u2014models are the\nbuilding blocks of which scientific theories are made up. Different\nversions of the semantic view work with different notions of a model,\nbut, as noted in\n Section 2.3,\n in the semantic view models are mostly construed as set-theoretic\nstructures. For a discussion of the different options, we refer the\nreader to the relevant entry in this encyclopedia (linked at the\nbeginning of this paragraph).\n",
