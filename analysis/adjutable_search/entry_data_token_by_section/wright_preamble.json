    "main_text": "\n\n\nChauncey Wright was an American philosopher of science of the second\nhalf of the nineteenth century and an early proponent of Darwinism in\nthe United States. Sometimes cited as a founder of pragmatism, he is\nmore appropriately remembered as an original \nthinker in the tradition of David Hume and John Stuart \nMill.[1]\nWright's primary interest and originality lay in philosophy of\nscience, but his insights and influence carried over to other venues,\nincluding philosophy of education and theory of meaning. Wright\nexercised a great influence at a crucial time in American cultural\nlife \u2014 in the 1860s and 70s, when the force of religious piety\nand Transcendentalism was waning.  He was a tireless critic of\nmetaphysics and the natural theology he believed it served, but he was\nalso a discriminating interpreter of principles in science and\nphilosophy. He wrote little and his influence was exerted by means of\nconversation and philosophical discussion with the circle of\nintellectuals and academics centered in Cambridge, Mass. from\n1850\u201375. This circle included Charles S. Peirce, William James,\nand Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., all of whom acknowledged Wright's\ninfluence.[2]\n\n\nWright accepted Hume's rejection of rational a priori knowledge and,\nfollowing the positivist Auguste Comte (1789\u20131857), he applied\nHume's lesson to theory in science. Wright regarded theory as a\ngrammar or logical template for organizing sense experience, which was\nthe only true origin of knowledge. As such, theory was a labor-saving\ndevice and usually mathematical in character. Some theoretical\nentities were real, but it is extremely difficult to settle upon any\nas surely real, given the method of science. That method is\nverification. Wright used the term verification to mean the testing of\ntheories by deducing from them consequences that can be confirmed by\ndirect perception, the \u201cundoubted testimony of the senses\u201d\n(PD 47). What are verified are predicted consequences of\ntheory. This commitment to the sensory base of ideas both at the\nbeginning and end of scientific investigation reinforced Wright's\nbelief that utility is what makes both nature and human affairs\nintelligible. The principle of utility informed his understanding of\nDarwin's Origin of Species as offering not axioms for deduction\nbut descriptive principles, in particular natural selection, that\nencompassed a wide range of disparate causes of change in\norganisms. From this vantage point on science, Wright became a\npenetrating interpreter and a brilliant defender of Darwinism in its\nintroduction into the United States. In what follows, Wright's\nphilosophy of science will be presented, highlighting the character of\nhis empiricism as it is revealed through his understanding of\ninduction. The influence of Mill's utilitarianism will be evident in\nhis interpretation of Darwin, which is presented next. The nature of\nhis positivism and his views on cosmology and natural theology are\nfollowed by a general characterization of his scientific\nphilosophy.\n",
