    "main_text": "The Equality of the Sexes || Natural equality\n4.3 Natural equality\n\nRegardless of how successfully Poulain is able to show the similarity\nbetween the intellectual capacities of women and men, such descriptive\nsimilarity provides a weak\u2014if any\u2014foundation for a\nnormative concept of equality (also Clarke 2013: 49; Hoekstra 2013).\nIn order to find a normative basis for Poulain\u2019s claim about the\nequality of the sexes I will first look at his references to the\nnatural equality and liberty of humankind. In De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, Poulain writes that\n\u201cdependence and servitude are contrary to the law of nature\nwhich makes all men equal\u201d (TTen 78; TTfr 95) and a few pages\nlater he points out that when humans are imagined separate from civil\nsociety, they are found \u201ccompletely free and equal, with only a\ndesire for self-preservation and an equal right to everything that\nwould be necessary to achieve it\u201d (T1en 164; TTfr 106). Poulain\ndoes not elaborate on what he means by the law of nature or by the\nstate of nature preceding civil society. It is not clear to what\nextent he is relying on the Scholastic tradition of natural law, which\nhe would have known from his studies at Sorbonne, and to what extent\nhe is inspired by more recent developments, such as the natural law\ntheory of Hugo Grotius and Thomas Hobbes.\n\nBoth passages cited above are situated in contexts that do have\nHobbesian connotations: in the first case Poulain is distinguishing\nnatural equality from the arbitrary nature of dependence in the civil\nstate (see also\n section 3.2)\n and in the second case he continues:\n\n\nBut [the woman studying law and politics] would also notice that this\nequality would involve them in war or a permanent state of mutual\ndistrust, which would be inconsistent with their objective, and that\nthe natural light of reason would dictate that they could not live in\npeace unless everyone surrendered their rights and made contracts or\nconventions. She would also see that, in order to validate these\ndecisions and to protect people from anxiety, it would be necessary to\nhave recourse to a third party who would have authority to force\neveryone to observe what they had promised to others. (T1en 164; TTfr\n106; see also Hobbes, Leviathan, part I, chap.\n13\u201315)\n\n\nOn these grounds, and considering which works were available in\nPoulain\u2019s intellectual context, Stuurman concludes that\n\u201cHobbes is his most likely source\u201d (2004: 177). The\nprobable influence of Hobbes is very illuminating, in particular when\nwe consider Poulain\u2019s view of the arbitrary nature of power, but\nStuurman seems to overemphasize the Hobbesian nature of\nPoulain\u2019s views when he indicates that Poulain rejects natural\nsociability (Stuurman 2004: 178). Poulain does indeed emphasize the\nrole of fear as a motive for political society in De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 (T1en 164; TTfr 106) as well as\nDe l\u2019excellence (TTen 280; TTfr 313), but it is crucial\nto note that he does not consider fear to be a necessary aspect of the\nnatural condition of humankind. The description of \u201cthe golden\nage of liberty\u201d, which Poulain gives in De\nl\u2019excellence, is a description of natural sociability:\n\n\nAt the dawn of the world, traces of which are still to be seen in the\ninnocent loves of shepherds and shepherdesses and in the pleasures of\nthe rustic life, which is untroubled by the fear of powers or enemies,\nall men were equal, just, and sincere, since their only rule and law\nwas that of good sense. (TTen 313; TTfr 392)\n\n\nAs we can see, fear does not exist in this original state, it is\nintroduced as a consequence of \u201csome men [taking] advantage of\ntheir strength and their leisure to try to subjugate others\u201d\n(ibid.; see also the passage cited in\n section 3.2).\n Poulain does claim that humans have \u201ca desire for\nself-preservation and an equal right to everything that would be\nnecessary to achieve it\u201d (T1en 164; TTfr 106), but when we\nconsider his writings as a whole, he does not seem to claim that this\ndesire is in itself the origin of constant confrontations and the fear\nraised by these confrontations.\n\nPoulain\u2019s discussions of natural equality and liberty in De\nl\u2019excellence are framed by theological references,\nincluding a reference to \u201cSt. Augustine, who claims that man\nshould place nothing above himself save God alone\u201d (TTen 279;\nTTfr 312; also Wilkin 2019: 234\u2013236). Poulain may have in mind a\npassage in De civitate Dei (book XIX, chap. 15), where\nAugustine writes:\n\n\nGod wanted rational man, made to his image, to have no dominion except\nover irrational nature. He meant no man, therefore, to have dominion\nover man, but only man over beast. So it fell out that those who were\nholy in primitive times became shepherds over sheep rather than\nmonarchs over men, [\u2026]. (Augustine 413\u2013427 [2008:\n223])\n\n\nKinch Hoekstra, among others, has emphasized that this chapter from\nDe civitate Dei, as well as a passage in De doctrina\nChristiana (book I, chap. 23), where Augustine states that human beings are naturally\nequal, influenced discussions about natural equality and liberty well\ninto the seventeenth century (Hoekstra 2013: 95). When we look for the\nnormative basis of Poulain\u2019s claim that all humans are equal\n(shepherds and all), this theological origin, deriving equality from\nthe creation of humankind, is at least as probable as Hobbes\u2019\naccount of equality (for an influential interpretation of the\nnormative nature of the latter, see Hoekstra 2013). Here we do not\nfind a definite break with the scholastic tradition. Poulain is using\nits concept of equality in order to argue\u2014against many\nScholastic authors\u2014that natural equality must be applied to the\nrelation between women and men.\n",
