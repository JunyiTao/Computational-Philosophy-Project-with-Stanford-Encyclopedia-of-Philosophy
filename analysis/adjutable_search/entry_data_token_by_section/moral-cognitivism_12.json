    "main_text": "Motivations for Non-cognitivism || Naturalism\n3.2 Naturalism\n\nNaturalism in metaphysics has been on the ascendancy for some time,\nthough it is often somewhat difficult to ascertain exactly what the\nposition amounts to. Metaphysical naturalists claim that there are\nonly natural properties, in some good sense of the term\n\u2018natural\u2019. Usually naturalism is taken to rule out at\nleast the existence of supernatural entities or properties. And one\nstandard way that naturalists have defended their position has been to\nreduce seemingly mysterious properties or objects which might appear\nto be non-natural to more familiar purportedly natural properties.\nThat is, they have tried to show that these objects or entities are\nnothing over and above some set of natural properties or objects\nappropriately arranged. One strategy is to identify seemingly suspect\nproperties with natural properties, either via connecting definitions\nor through synthetic identities. In this way the seemingly suspect\nproperties can be allowed into the naturalist\u2019s ontology without\nundermining the commitment to naturalism. Many naturalists have taken\nthis approach to moral properties (Firth 1952; Railton 1986; Boyd\n1988).\n\nNon-cognitivism is not a form of reductive\nnaturalism about the contents of moral judgments, beliefs and\nsentences. It does not equate the property seemingly predicated in\nsuch judgments with any natural property, precisely because it denies\nthat the (primary) function of such expressions is to predicate\nproperties. But in another good sense non-cognitivists are\nnaturalists. They offer a reduction of the attitude of accepting a\nmoral judgment to a perfectly naturalistic sort of attitude such as\nthe attitude of approval or disapproval. And they do not postulate any\nproperties which cannot be reduced to natural properties. Thus another\nmotivation for accepting non-cognitivism has been naturalism. If\nsomeone doubts the prospects for reducing moral properties to natural\nproperties (perhaps under the influence of the open question\nargument), they need not concede that there are any extra-natural or\nsupernatural properties. One can simply reinterpret even the moral\njudgments one accepts as predicating no properties at all. Or, as with\nthe more sophisticated versions of non-cognitivism, one can allow them\nto predicate natural properties and argue that the appearance that\nthey do something other than this is due to the additional expressive\ncomponent in their meaning. One\u2019s naturalism will then not\ncommit one to giving up moral judgments or reducing moral properties\nto natural properties (Ayer 1952, 106\u20137).\n",
