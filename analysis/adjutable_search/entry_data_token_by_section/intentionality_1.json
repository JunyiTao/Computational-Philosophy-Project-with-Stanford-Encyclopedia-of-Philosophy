Intentional inexistence\n\nContemporary discussions of the nature of intentionality were launched\nand many of them were anticipated by Franz Brentano (1874,\n88\u201389) in his book, Psychology From an Empirical\nStandpoint, from which I quote two famous paragraphs:\n\nEvery mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of\nthe Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an\nobject, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously,\nreference to a content, direction toward an object (which is not to be\nunderstood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every\nmental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although\nthey do not do so in the same way. In presentation, something is\npresented, in judgment something is affirmed or denied, in love loved,\nin hate hated, in desire desired and so on.\n\n\nThis intentional inexistence is characteristic exclusively of mental\nphenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We can,\ntherefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those\nphenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves.\n\n\nAs one reads these lines, numerous questions arise: what does Brentano\nmean when he says that the object towards which the mind directs\nitself \u2018is not to be understood as meaning a thing\u2019? What\ncan it be for a phenomenon (mental or otherwise) to exhibit \u2018the\nintentional inexistence of an object\u2019? What is it for a\nphenomenon to \u2018include something as object within itself\u2019?\nDo \u2018reference to a content\u2019 and \u2018direction toward an\nobject\u2019 express two distinct ideas? Or are they two distinct\nways of expressing one and the same idea? If intentionality can relate\na mind to something that either does not exist or exists wholly within\nthe mind, what sort of relation can it be?\n\nReplete as they are with complex, abstract and controversial ideas,\nthese two short paragraphs have set the agenda for all subsequent\nphilosophical discussions of intentionality in the late nineteenth and\nthe twentieth century. There has been some discussion over the meaning\nof Brentano\u2019s expression \u2018intentional inexistence.\u2019\nDid Brentano mean that the objects onto which the mind is directed are\ninternal to the mind itself (in-exist in the mind)?\nOr did he mean that the mind can be directed onto\nnon-existent objects? Or did he mean both? (See Crane, 1998\nfor further discussion.)\n\nSome of the leading ideas of the phenomenological tradition can be\ntraced back to this issue. Following the lead of Edmund Husserl (1900,\n1913), who was both the founder of phenomenology and a student of\nBrentano\u2019s, the point of the phenomenological analysis has been\nto show that the essential property of intentionality of being\ndirected onto something is not contingent upon whether some\nreal physical target exists independently of the intentional act\nitself. To achieve this goal, two concepts have been central to\nHusserl\u2019s internalist interpretation of intentionality: the\nconcept of a noema (plural noemata) and the concept\nof epoche (i.e., bracketing) or phenomenological reduction.\nBy the word \u2018noema,\u2019 Husserl refers to the internal\nstructure of mental acts. The phenomenological reduction is meant to\nhelp get at the essence of mental acts by suspending all naive\npresuppositions about the difference between real and fictitious\nentities (on these complex phenomenological concepts, see the papers\nby F\u00f8llesdal and others conveniently gathered in Dreyfus\n(1982). For further discussion, see Bell (1990) and Dummett\n(1993).\n\nIn the two paragraphs quoted above, Brentano sketches an entire\nresearch programme based on three distinct theses. According to the\nfirst thesis, it is constitutive of the phenomenon of intentionality,\nas it is exhibited by mental states such as loving, hating, desiring,\nbelieving, judging, perceiving, hoping and many others, that these\nmental states are directed towards things different from themselves.\nAccording to the second thesis, it is characteristic of the objects\ntowards which the mind is directed by virtue of intentionality that\nthey have the property which Brentano calls intentional inexistence.\nAccording to the third thesis, intentionality is the mark of the\nmental: all and only mental states exhibit intentionality.\n\nUnlike Brentano\u2019s third thesis, Brentano\u2019s first two\ntheses can hardly be divorced from each other. The first thesis can\neasily be recast so as to be unacceptable unless the second thesis is\naccepted. Suppose that it is constitutive of the nature of\nintentionality that one could not exemplify such mental states as\nloving, hating, desiring, believing, judging, perceiving, hoping, and\nso on, unless there was something to be loved, hated,\ndesired, believed, judged, perceived, hoped, and so on. If so, then it\nfollows from the very nature of intentionality (as described by the\nfirst thesis) that nothing could exhibit intentionality unless there\nwere objects\u2014intentional objects\u2014that satisfied\nthe property Brentano called intentional inexistence.\n\nNow, the full acceptance of Brentano\u2019s first two theses raises a\nfundamental ontological question in philosophical logic. The question\nis: are there such intentional objects? Does due recognition of\nintentionality force us to postulate the ontological category of\nintentional objects? This question has given rise to a major division\nwithin analytic philosophy. The prevailing (or orthodox) response has\nbeen a resounding \u2018No.\u2019 But an important minority of\nphilosophers, whom I shall call \u2018the intentional-object\u2019\ntheorists, have argued for a positive response to the question. Since\nintentional objects need not exist, according to intentional-object\ntheorists, there are things that do not exist. According to their\ncritics, there are no such things.\n\nWe shall directly examine the intentional-object theorists approach in\nsection 7. Before doing so, in section 3, we shall examine the way\nsingular thoughts about concrete particulars in space and time can be\nand have been construed as paradigms of genuine intentional relations.\nOn this relational construal, an individual\u2019s ordinary singular\nthought about a concrete physical particular involves a genuine\nrelation between the individual\u2019s mind and the concrete physical\nparticular. In sections 4\u20135, we shall examine two puzzles that\nfurther arise on the orthodox paradigm. First, we shall deal with the\npuzzle of how a rational person can believe of an object referred to\nby one singular term that it instantiates a property and\nsimultaneously disbelieve of the same object referred to by a distinct\nsingular term that it instantiates the same property. Section 4 is\ndevoted to Frege\u2019s solution to this puzzle. In section 5, we\nshall scrutinize Russell\u2019s solution to the puzzle of true\nnegative existential statements. In section 6, we shall see how the\ntheory of direct reference emerged within the orthodox paradigm out of\na critique of both Frege\u2019s notion of sense and Russell\u2019s\nassumption that most proper names in natural languages are disguised\ndefinite descriptions.\n",
