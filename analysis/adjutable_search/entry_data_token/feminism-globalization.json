What is Globalization?\n1.1 Economic Globalization\n\nEconomic globalization refers to the processes of global economic\nintegration that emerged in the late 20th century, fueled\nby neoliberal ideals. Rooted in classical liberal economic thought,\nneoliberalism claims that a largely unregulated capitalist economy\nembodies the ideal of free individual choice and maximizes economic\nefficiency and growth, technological progress, and distributive\njustice. Economic globalization is associated with particular global\npolitical and economic institutions, such as the World Trade\nOrganization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, and\nspecific neoliberal economic policies, such as the following:\n\nTrade liberalization. Free trade policies, such as the\nUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (also known as the New NAFTA),\nseek to integrate regional or global markets by reducing trade\nbarriers among nations. Signatory countries typically agree to\neliminate tariffs, such as duties and surcharges, as well as nontariff\nobstacles to trade, such as licensing regulations, quotas on imports,\nand subsidies to domestic producers. \nDeregulation. Trade liberalization is associated with the\neasing of restrictions on capital flow and investment, along with the\nelimination of government regulations that can be seen as unfair\nbarriers to trade, including legal protections for workers, consumers,\nand the environment. \nPrivatization of public assets. Economic globalization is\nmarked by the sale of state-owned enterprises, goods, and services to\nprivate investors in the name of expanding markets and increasing\nefficiency. Such assets include banks, key industries, highways and\nrailroads, power and electricity, education, and healthcare.\nPrivatization often also involves the sale of publicly owned,\neconomically exploitable natural resources, such as water, minerals,\nforests, and land, to private investors.\nElimination of social welfare programs. Neoliberalism\nfavors sharp reductions in public expenditures for social services,\nsuch as housing, health care, education, and disability and\nunemployment insurance, as a crucial means of reducing the role of\ngovernment and making private businesses more efficient. Structural\nAdjustment Policies (SAPs) have been instrumental in requiring\ncountries in the global South to eliminate social welfare spending.\nSince the early 1980s, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund\nhave required debtor nations to adopt SAPs as a condition of borrowing\nmoney or improving conditions of existing loans. SAPs require debtor\nnations to restructure their economies along neoliberal lines, by, for\nexample, removing government regulation, eliminating social welfare\nprograms, and promoting market competition.\nRestrictions on immigration. While many countries have\nliberalized capital markets and eased barriers to transnational trade\nin goods and services under globalization, most have not eliminated\nbarriers to the flow of labor. Indeed, some affluent countries, such\nas the United States, have implemented more restrictive immigration\npolicies, leading to the detention and deportation of thousands of\nundocumented immigrants and the militarization of national borders.\nDespite these restrictions, however, migration has increased along\nwith other processes of globalization.\n\n\nPolitical philosophers are concerned with the effects of these\npolicies on human well-being. Proponents of globalization claim that\neconomic liberalization has enabled many people throughout the world\nto move out of conditions of dire poverty. Open markets, they argue,\nhave increased employment and productivity within developing\ncountries, raising the standard of living and enhancing the well-being\nof the people living within them (Diamandis and Kotler 2012, Friedman\n2012, Micklethwait and Wooldridge 2000, O\u2019Neil 2013). Critics\npoint out that neoliberal policies have created the widest gap between\nthe very rich and very poor in history, with unprecedented wealth for\nthe rich and poverty and destitution for millions of the global poor\n(Nikiforuk 2007, Pogge 2002). Feminists have pointed out that pockets\nof highly concentrated wealth in the \u201cglobal South\u201d and\nthe high levels of extreme poverty in the \u201cglobal North\u201d\nmean that we cannot divide the world neatly along North/South or\nrich/poor lines (Silvey 2014). However, on the whole, they argue,\nglobalization has benefitted the world\u2019s wealthiest\npeople\u2014both citizens of the global North and the elite in\ndeveloping countries\u2014without substantially benefitting the\nmajority of the world\u2019s population.\n\nFeminist philosophers insist that economic globalization must also be\nunderstood in terms of the effects it has had on women, who make up a\ndisproportionate percentage of the global poor. Most agree that these\neffects have been primarily negative. For instance, Jaggar argues that\nglobalization has promised many things that are crucial to feminists:\npeace, prosperity, social justice, environmental protection, the\nelimination of racism and ethnocentrism, and, of course, an increase\nin the status of women. However, neoliberal policies have brought\nabout the opposite of these aspirations. Rather than peace, they have\ncreated conditions for war and increased militarism; rather than\nprosperity and social justice, they have increased the gulf between\nthe rich and the poor; rather than environmental protection, they have\nled to the privatization and destruction of publicly-owned natural\nresources; and rather than eliminating racist, ethnocentric, and\nsexist barriers, globalization has been, ultimately, \u201ca system\nhostile or antagonistic to women\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 301).\n1.2 Political Globalization\n\nAlthough political and economic globalization are interconnected and\nmutually reinforcing, they differ in significant ways. Political\nglobalization refers to changes in the exercise of political power\nthat have resulted from increased transnational engagement. Prior to\nWorld War II, the international political system was understood in\nterms of the so-called Westphalian model. According to this model,\npolitical power is exercised primarily through governance at the level\nof the territorial state. The international political system is\ncomprised of sovereign states, which enjoy a monopoly on political\npower within their own territories. International treaties govern\nrelations among states; however, states generally cannot legitimately\nintervene in the domestic affairs of other nations. Thus, when\nproblems, such as famines, genocides, and civil wars arise, they are\nseen primarily as security issues for individual states, not matters\nof justice affecting the global community (Fraser 2013).\n\nIn contrast to this state-centric model, political globalization must\nbe understood as polycentric, that is, as involving non-state\ninstitutions that exercise political power from both\n\u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d the state (So 2010). The\ndevelopment of supra-national institutions, such as the United\nNations, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization,\nthe European Union, NATO, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,\nand others, can be understood as political \u201cglobalization from\nabove.\u201d These institutions create international rules that\nconstrain the sovereignty of states, in some cases, through\nenforcement mechanisms that penalize for noncompliance. In addition to\nholding states accountable for adhering to mutually agreed upon norms\nand standards, global institutions often set the agendas that\ndetermine which issues receive international attention. Institutions\nsuch as the UN and EU have sought to draw attention to some of the\ninjustices experienced by women around the world, such as sexual\nviolence, lack of educational access, and other women\u2019s human\nrights violations, and to develop global frameworks for addressing\nthem. However, many feminist philosophers argue that supra-national\ninstitutions have had limited success in protecting the world\u2019s\nmost vulnerable people. Most global institutions privilege Western and\ncorporate interests over those of vulnerable and marginalized people,\nand few have been successful in challenging the structural\ninequalities that give rise to gendered harms, such as deprivation,\ndiscrimination, and violence. \n\nFor many feminists, the transnational political movements that have\nemerged \u201cfrom below\u201d the state offer a more promising\ndimension of political globalization. The expansion of global\ncommunications has led to the development of new transnational\npolitical networks, comprised of individuals, non-governmental\norganizations, and social movements. These transnational networks,\nsometimes referred to as \u201cglobal civil society,\u201d connect\nmillions of people around the world based on shared political\ncommitments. Consequently, some feminist philosophers believe that\npolitical \u201cglobalization from below\u201d provides women and\nother vulnerable people with an effective means for resisting the\ninequalities created by economic globalization. For instance, some\nfeminists argue that globalization has created new transnational\npublic spheres in which political opinion can be marshaled to hold\nleaders democratically accountable (Fraser 2009, Gould 2009). This\ntransnational public sphere must be understood both in terms of\nphysical locations, such as home, factory, and village, as well as\ntechnologically mediated spaces made possible by the internet; such\nmodes of communication form a new layer of transnational space that\nallows people to build horizontal networks and communities (Youngs\n2005). Others see the promise of political globalization in\ntransnational feminist solidarity networks, such as the women\u2019s\nrights are human rights campaign and groups combating sex trafficking,\nglobal care chains, and labor exploitation that enable feminist\nresistance to dominant political and economic forces (Copelon 2003,\nGallegos 2017, Hochschild 2000, 2002, Kittay, 2008, 2009, Parekh 2009,\nRobinson 2003, Stamatopoulou 1995, Walby 2002, Weir 2005). \n\nGiven the complexity of globalization, how have feminist political\nphilosophers addressed the social, political, and economic challenges\nposed by it? Below, we provide an overview of several feminist\ntheoretical approaches to this task.\n2. Feminist Theoretical Approaches to Globalization\n\n\u2018Feminist theoretical approaches to globalization\u2019 is an\numbrella term that refers to a number of specific theoretical\napproaches that feminists have used to articulate the challenges that\nglobalization poses for women, people of color, and the global poor.\nThese various approaches include those developed by postcolonial\nfeminists, transnational feminists, and feminists who endorse an\nethics of care. In this section, we identify four key features shared\nby these various feminist approaches to globalization and outline some\nof the distinctive characteristics of each theoretical\norientation.\n2.1 Key Common Features\n\nFirst, feminist approaches to globalization seek to provide frameworks\nfor understanding the gender injustices associated with globalization.\nRather than developing all-encompassing ideal theories of global\njustice, however, feminist philosophers tend to adopt the non-ideal\ntheoretical perspectives, which focus on specific, concrete issues.\nEarly feminist analyses focused on issues that were widely believed to\nbe of particular importance to women around the world, such as\ndomestic violence, workplace discrimination, and human rights\nviolations against women. While gendered analyses of these issues have\nprovided valuable insights into the distinctive nature of the harms\ninvolved, many feminist philosophers view this approach as too narrow,\nboth in terms of the specific issues it addresses and its\nmethodological approach to these issues. They contend that even\napparently gender-neutral global issues often have a gendered\ndimension, including war, global governance, migration, southern debt,\nthe \u201cresource curse,\u201d and climate change. Moreover, by\naddressing specific global \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d as\nindependent phenomena, early feminist analyses failed to take into\naccount the systematic and structural gendered injustices associated\nwith neoliberalism. Although gender oppression takes different forms\nin different social, cultural, and geographical locations, women in\nevery society face systematic disadvantages, such as those resulting\nfrom their socially assigned responsibility for domestic work (Lange\n2009). Because of these structural injustices, women of all\nnationalities tend to suffer more from the poverty, overwork,\ndeprivation, and political marginalization associated with neoliberal\npolicies. Thus, more recent feminist analyses of globalization tend to\nunderstand the outcomes of globalization not as disparate or\ncontingent phenomena, but rather as a result of systematic, structural\ninjustices on a global scale. Indeed, some contend that the global\nbasic structure itself is implicitly biased against women (Jaggar\n2009a).\n\nThe second key feature of feminist approaches to globalization is a\nshared commitment to core feminist values, including an opposition to\nthe subordination of women. Some theorists also draw upon feminist\ninterpretations of mainstream moral and political ideals, such as\nequality, democracy, and human rights, to develop critiques of\nneoliberal policies. For instance, Jaggar appeals to liberal\ndemocratic norms to argue that many southern debt obligations are not\nmorally binding because their citizenries were \u201clargely\nuninformed and/or their options were virtually non-existent\u201d\nwhen they undertook these supposed debts (Jaggar 2002a, 433). Many\nfeminists also use the language of human rights to address the\nchallenges of globalization. While they acknowledge that traditional\nunderstandings of human rights are implicitly male-biased, they\ncontend that feminist rearticulations of these norms can help to\nidentify the gendered harms involved in sexual slavery, forced\ndomestic labor, and the systematic withholding of education, food, and\nhealthcare from women and girls that follow from severe economic\ndeprivation (Bunch 2006, Cudd 2005, Jaggar 2002a, Nussbaum 2001,\nRobinson 2004, Okin 1998, Reilly 2007). (See Section 3.3 below.)\n\nHowever, not all feminist political philosophers agree with this\napproach. Some believe that new feminist ideals, such as relational\nunderstandings of power, collective responsibility, and mutual\ndependence, are needed to diagnose the gender injustices associated\nwith globalization (Hankivsky 2006, Held 2004, 2007, Kittay 2008,\n2009, Miller 2006, 2011, Robinson 2006, 2010, Weir 2008a, 2008b, Young\n2011). For instance, Iris Marion Young argues the traditional ideal\ntheories of justice are unable to account for the unjust background\nconditions that contribute to the development of sweatshops in the\nglobal South. She argues that a new relational model of\nresponsibility, which she calls the social connection model, is needed\nto articulate the obligations that people in affluent northern\ncountries have to workers in the global South. The social connection\nmodel holds that individuals bear responsibility for structural\ninjustices, such as those suffered by workers on the global assembly\nline, because our actions contribute to the institutional processes\nthat produce such injustices. In particular, northern consumers have a\nresponsibility to organize collectively to reform the injustices\nassociated with sweatshop labor (Young 2011).\n\nThe third key feature of feminist approaches to globalization is an\nemphasis on feminist methodologies. In particular, these approaches\ntend to embody three key methodological commitments. The first is\nintersectionality, which maintains that systems of oppression interact\nto produce injustices, and thus, that gender injustices cannot be\nunderstood solely in terms of sex or gender. Feminists who theorize\nabout justice on the domestic level argue that women\u2019s\nexperiences of gender oppression are shaped by other forms of\noppression, such as those based on race, class, disability, and sexual\norientation. Feminist theorists of globalization contend that gender\noppression interacts with these systems of oppression, along with\nother forms of systematic disadvantage that arise within the global\ncontext. Salient categories include nationality, geographical\nlocation, citizenship status, and socioeconomic position within the\nglobal economy (for instance, as a Southern elite, a Western laborer,\nor a worker on the global assembly line). Given this broad conception\nof intersectionality, feminist theorists of globalization insist that\ngender injustices arise within specific transnational contexts, such\nas historical relationships among nations and current global economic\npolicies. \n\nThe second methodological commitment shared by feminist approaches to\nglobalization is a sensitivity to context and concrete specificity.\nFeminist philosophers strive to accurately reflect the diverse\ninterests, experience, and concerns of women throughout the world, and\nto take seriously differences in culture, history, and socio-economic\nand political circumstances. In this way, feminist approaches to\nglobalization attempt to move between local conditions and global\npressures, between historical realities and contemporary experiences\nof oppression and vulnerability, while being attentive to complex\ninteractions among social, economic, and political forces. This has\nled some feminist theorists of globalization to distinguish their\nviews from well-known feminists, such as Martha Nussbaum and Susan\nOkin, whom Ackerly and Attanasi refer to as \u201cinternational\nfeminists\u201d by virtue of their methodological commitments. In\ntheir view, Nussbaum and Okin do not pay sufficient attention to the\nways that justice and injustice are mediated by local conditions in\ntheir attempts to identify universal moral ideals. As a result, their\ntheories tend to privilege Western perspectives and undermine their\nown commitment to reflecting women\u2019s lived experience (Ackerly\nand Attanasi 2009).\n\nFinally, feminist theorists of globalization are committed to\ndeveloping self-reflexive critiques. At the heart of this methodology\nis a willingness to critically examine feminist claims, with\nparticular attention to the ways in which feminist discourses\nprivilege certain points of view. For instance, Schutte insists that\nostensibly universal feminist values and ideas are likely to embody\nthe values of dominant cultures. This helps to explain why the voices\nof women from developing countries are often taken seriously only if\nthey reflect the norms and values of the West and conform to Western\nexpectations. Thus, Schutte insists that feminists must engage in\nmethodological practices that de-center their habitual standpoints and\nforeground perspectives that challenge accepted ways of thinking\n(Schutte 2002). Khader extends this call, urging transnational\nfeminists to reject the problematic variants of \u201cEnlightenment\nliberal\u201d values taken to be central to Western feminism,\nincluding individualism, autonomy, and gender-role eliminativism\n(Khader 2019, 3). Such values not only constitute cultural imperialism\nwhen imposed on cultural \u201cothers,\u201d as Schutte argues, but\nalso can serve to justify militarism, political domination, economic\nexploitation, and white supremacy in the name of advancing gender\ninterests (Khader 2019). Ackerly argues that feminist theory can be\nused not only to critique feminist ideals and values, but also to\ndevelop richer ways to evaluate the work done by women\u2019s human\nrights organizations. Feminist theory is able to engage with, shape\nand be shaped by the work being done \u201con the ground\u201d by\nNGOs and other groups (Ackerly 2009). \n\nThe struggle to develop feminist theories that embody these\nmethodological commitments has been ongoing for feminists. In the\n1980s, Chandra Talpade Mohanty observed that Western feminist\nscholarship tends to adopt an ethnocentric perspective, depicting\nso-called Third-World women as one-dimensional, non-agentic, and\nhomogenous. In her often-cited words, such scholarship tends to\nsuggest that:\n\nthe average Third World woman leads an essentially truncated life\nbased on her feminine gender (read: sexually constrained) and her\nbeing \u201cThird World\u201d (read: ignorant, poor, uneducated,\ntradition-bound, domestic, family-oriented, victimized, etc.). This, I\nsuggest, is in contrast to the (implicit) self-representation of\nWestern women as educated, as modern, as having control over their own\nbodies and sexualities and the freedom to make their own decisions\n(Mohanty 2003, 22).\n\n\nMohanty claims that this perspective leads to a simplistic\nunderstanding of what feminists in Western countries can do to\n\u201chelp\u201d women in developing nations. Many of the recent\ndevelopments in the feminist literature on globalization can be\nunderstood as a response to this theoretical failure. In addition to\nrecognizing the ways in which power influences the production of\nfeminist theories, feminist critics of globalization strive to\nunderstand the ways in which Western women share responsibility for\ngender injustices in developing countries and at home, and to\narticulate their obligations to eliminate these injustices.\n2.2 Distinctive Feminist Approaches\n\nDespite these common aims and methodological commitments, feminists\nhave analyzed globalization from a number of different theoretical\nperspectives. Below, we examine three prominent approaches to\nglobalization, developed by postcolonial and decolonial,\ntransnational, and ethics of care feminists. Although it is not\npossible to draw sharp boundaries around these theoretical\nperspectives, we identify some distinctive features of each.\n2.2.1 Postcolonial and Decolonial Feminisms\n\nPostcolonial and decolonial feminisms offer primarily critical\ntheoretical frameworks, which analyze globalization within the context\nof the history of Western colonialism and imperialism. They begin with\nthe claim that Western colonialism and imperialism have played\nimportant roles in shaping the contemporary world, and highlight their\nenduring effects on global relations and local cultural practices.\nAlthough postcolonial and decolonial feminists write from all over the\nworld, they foreground non-Eurocentric epistemic standpoints and\ncriticize North-South power asymmetries from the diverse perspectives\nof members of Indigenous communities and people in the global South\n(Herr 2013, Khader 2019, McLaren 2017, Schutte 2002, 2005). \n\nPostcolonial and decolonial feminists make several important claims.\nFirst, they insist that it is impossible to understand local practices\nin developing countries without acknowledging the ways in which these\npractices have been shaped by their economic and historical contexts,\nparticularly their connection to Western colonialism and imperialism.\nMoreover, they warn that attempts to explain the suffering of women in\ndeveloping countries in simplistic terms often tend to reproduce a\n\u201ccolonial stance\u201d toward the global South. For instance,\nas we explained above, Chandra Mohanty sees elements of imperialism in\nWestern feminist scholarship on women in the global South. Similarly,\nUma Narayan criticize feminists for unwittingly adopting a Eurocentric\nperspective. For example, some Western feminist scholars, such as Mary\nDaly, strongly criticize cultural practices, such as sati, the Indian\npractice of widow immolation, as self-evidently wrong. However,\nNarayan argues that approaching sati as an isolated, local phenomenon\nfundamentally misrepresents it. Understanding sati in the context of\ncolonial history provides a richer analysis of this practice, since it\ngained its symbolic power during British rule as an emblem of Hindu\nand Indian culture (Narayan 1997). Highlighting the role that\ncolonialism has played in shaping local practices enables feminists to\navoid adopting a Eurocentric perspective. Likewise, postcolonial and\ndecolonial feminists insist that any feminist analysis of the harms of\nglobalization must take seriously the history and ongoing cultural,\neconomic, and political effects of colonialism and imperialism.\n\nPostcolonial and decolonial feminists further argue that although\ntraditional forms of colonialism have formally ended, many aspects of\nglobalization are best understood as neo-colonial practices. As Sally\nScholz explains:\n\nMultinational corporations and global businesses, largely centered in\nWestern nations, bring their own colonizing influence through business\nmodels, hegemonic culture, exploitation of workers, and displacement\nof traditional trades. Whereas traditional forms of colonialism\nentailed the colonizer assuming the privilege of ruling the colony,\nthis neocolonialism rules indirectly through the power it creates and\nenjoys by bringing manufacturing jobs to an area or providing consumer\ngoods to a people \u2013 often Western inspired consumer goods as\nwell. Old style colonialism often killed or displaced indigenous\npeoples; the new style of colonialism impoverishes a culture by\nswamping society with Western values, products or ideals (2010, 139).\n\n\nMore broadly, postcolonial and decolonial feminists observe that many\nof the conditions created by colonialism\u2014economic inequality and\nexploitation, racism, cultural marginalization, and the domination of\nthe global South by the global North\u2014have been sustained and\nintensified by neoliberalism. Moreover, they argue, neoliberal\npolicies and institutions systematically favor countries in the global\nNorth to the detriment of southern nations. International trade\npolicies serve Western interests even while claiming to be politically\nneutral and fair. Global economic institutions also privilege Western\nculture and political norms, presenting them as models for the rest of\nthe world, while ignoring and marginalizing the claims of\nwomen\u2019s and indigenous movements in the global South as well as\nsettler nations (Weendon 2002). Since appeals to so-called universal\nconcepts, epistemologies, and values, such as freedom, rights, and\nautonomy, can be used to further imperialist projects, postcolonial\nand decolonial feminists seek to develop normative positions that\ncriticize neoliberal and neocolonial practices while rejecting\nproblematic ethnocentric ideals that often masquerade as universal\n(Alcoff 2017, Khader, 2019, McLaren 2017, Pohlhaus Jr. 2017, Weir\n2017).\n2.2.2 Ethics of Care\n\nAnother prominent school of feminist theoretical responses to\nglobalization puts care, both caring labor\u2014the work of caring\nfor the young, old, sick, and disabled, and the everyday maintenance\nof households\u2014and the moral ideal of care, at the center of its\nanalyses. Proponents of this approach begin by observing that most\nmainstream analyses of globalization either ignore or devalue care.\nThis is problematic, they argue, for at least three reasons: (1) care\nwork, which is done almost exclusively by women, has been profoundly\ninfluenced by globalization; (2) the values and work associated with\ncare are both undervalued and insufficiently supported, and this\ncontributes to gender, racial, and economic inequality, both within\ncountries and between the global North and the global South; and (3)\nany viable alternative to neoliberal globalization must prioritize the\nmoral ideal of care. Thus, ethics of care approaches to globalization\nhave both theoretical and practical dimensions.\n\nTheoretically, ethics of care feminists aim to provide a systematic\ncritique of neoliberal assumptions and develop moral ideals capable of\nguiding more just forms of globalization. In their view, neoliberalism\npresupposes a problematic notion of the self, which posits individuals\nas atomistic, independent, and self-interested, and an inaccurate\nsocial ontology, which suggests that human relationships are formed by\nchoice rather than necessity or dependency. These assumptions lead\nneoliberalism to prioritize economic growth, efficiency, and profit\nmaking over other values, such as equality, human rights, and care.\nEthics of care feminists reject these assumptions. In their view,\nhuman beings are fundamentally relational and interdependent;\nindividuals are defined, indeed constituted, by their caring\nrelationships. All persons experience long periods during which their\nlives literally depend on the care of others, and everyone needs some\ndegree of care in order flourish. Thus, vulnerability, dependency, and\nneed should be understood not as deficits or limitations, but rather\nas essential human qualities requiring an adequate political\nresponse.\n\nEthics of care feminists contend that relational values, including\ncare, should form the basis of more just forms of globalization. In\nHankivsky\u2019s view, a global ethics of care begins with three\nassumptions: \u201c1) care is considered to be a fundamental aspect\nof all human life; 2) all human beings are interdependent by virtue of\nbeing part of ongoing relations of care; and 3) \u2018people are\nentitled to care because they are part of ongoing relations of\ncare\u2019\u201d (9). Because a global care ethics begins with a\nrelational ontology, it requires global political leaders to develop\nsocial and economic policies that aim to meet human needs and reduce\nsuffering rather than to expand markets and increase economic\ncompetition (Hankivsky 2006). Held endorses a similar view. According\nto her, an ethic of care requires leaders to foster a global economy\nthat is capable of meeting universal human needs (Held 2004, 2007).\nSimilarly, Miller advocates a \u201cglobal duty to care,\u201d which\nrequires individuals to take responsibility for their role in\ncontributing to global oppression, and obligates leaders to advocate\nfor institutions that embody the moral value of care (Miller\n2006).\n\nConcretely, feminist theorists who favor an ethics of care approach\nhighlight the role of care work in the global economy and put forth\nrecommendations for reevaluating it. For example, Robinson develops a\nrelational moral ontology that sheds lights on the features of\nglobalization that are usually invisible: the global distribution of\ncare work and the corresponding patterns of gender and racial\ninequality; the under-provision of public resources for care work in\nboth developed and developing countries; and the ways in which unpaid\nor low-paid care work sustains cycles of exploitation and inequality\non a global scale (Robinson 2006a, 2006b). Similarly, Held advocates\nfor increased state support of various forms of care work and for\npolicies designed to meet people\u2019s needs in caring ways (Held\n2004, 2007).\n2.2.3 Transnational Feminism\n\nIn its broadest sense, transnational feminism maintains that\nglobalization has created the conditions for feminist solidarity\nacross national borders. On the one hand, globalization has enabled\ntransnational processes that generate injustices for women in multiple\ngeographical locations, such the global assembly line (discussed\nbelow). Yet on the other, the technologies associated with\nglobalization have created new political spaces that enable feminist\npolitical resistance. Thus, transnational feminists incorporate the\ncritical insights of postcolonial, Third World and ethics of care\nfeminists into a positive vision of transnational feminist solidarity.\n\n\nTransnational feminism is sometimes contrasted with global or\ninternational feminism, a second-wave theory that emphasizes\nsolidarity among women across national boundaries based on their\ncommon experience of patriarchal oppression. However, transnational\nfeminism differs from global feminism in at least three significant\nrespects. \n\nFirst, transnational feminism is sensitive to differences among women.\nGlobal feminists argue that patriarchy is universal; women across the\nglobe have a common experience of gender oppression. They promote the\nrecognition of a \u201cglobal sisterhood\u201d based on these shared\nexperiences, which transcends differences in race, class, sexuality,\nand national boundaries. This solidarity is thought to provide a\nunified front against global patriarchy. Transnational feminists also\nadvocate for solidarity across national boundaries. However, their\napproach emphasizes the methodological commitments discussed above,\nspecifically intersectionality, sensitivity to concrete specificity,\nand self-reflexivity. Transnational feminists are careful to point out\nthat although globalizing processes affect everyone, they affect\ndifferent women very differently, based on their geographical and\nsocial locations. They are also quick to acknowledge that many aspects\nof globalization may benefit some women while unduly burdening many\nothers. \n\nSecond, transnational feminist solidarity is political in nature.\nWhereas global feminists advocate a form of social solidarity defined\non the basis of characteristics shared by all women, such as a common\ngender identity or experience of patriarchal oppression, transnational\nfeminist solidarity is grounded in the political commitments of\nindividuals, such as the commitment to challenge injustice or\noppression. Because transnational feminist solidarity is based on\nshared political commitments rather than a common identity or uniform\nset of experiences, advantaged individuals, including those who have\nbenefited from injustice, can join in solidarity with those who have\nexperienced injustice or oppression directly (Ferguson 2009, Scholz\n2008). The emphasis on shared political commitments also enables\nfeminists to resist oppressive conditions that manifest differently in\ndifferent geographical locations but are nonetheless prevalent in many\ncountries, such as racialized violence against women (Khader 2019,\n44\u201348). \n\nThird, transnational feminists focus on specific globalizing\nprocesses, such as the growth of offshore manufacturing, rather than a\ntheorized global patriarchy, and often take existing transnational\nfeminist collectives as a model for their theoretical accounts of\nsolidarity. For instance, Ann Ferguson argues that anti-globalization\nnetworks, such as worker-owned cooperatives, labor unions, fair trade\norganizations, and land reform movements, are creating the conditions\nfor North-South women\u2019s coalition movements based on\nnon-essentialist political commitments to global gender justice\n(Ferguson, 2009; see also Kang 2008, Khader 2019, Mendoza, 2002,\nVargas, 2003).\n3. Issues\n\nIn addition to analyzing the gendered dimensions of globalization,\nfeminist political philosophers discuss specific issues that have been\nshaped by it. Below, we discuss four representative examples. First,\nwe discuss two issues associated with economic\nglobalization\u2014economic justice and migration\u2014and then we\nturn to two issues connected to political globalization\u2014human\nrights and global governance.\n3.1 Economic Justice\n\nIt is widely argued that neoliberal policies have created dramatic\neconomic inequalities, both between the global North and global South\nand within countries in both hemispheres. One task for feminist\npolitical philosophers has been to identify the ways in which these\npolicies reinforce specific inequalities based on gender, class, race,\nand nationality. In particular, feminists shed light on the disparate\nand often disproportionately burdensome consequences of neoliberal\npolicies for specific groups of women. An additional, related task has\nbeen to identify the ways in which gendered practices and ideologies\nshape the processes of globalization. \n\nFree trade policies feature prominently in such feminist critiques.\nTrade liberalization has led to the wide-scale movement of once\nwell-paying manufacturing jobs in the global North to low wage, export\nprocessing or free trade zones in the global South. In the global\nNorth, the pressure on companies to \u201coutsource\u201d jobs to\ncountries where labor is cheaper and working conditions are less\nregulated has meant that many of the workers who once relied on\nwell-paying manufacturing jobs are now unable to make a living. These\njobs have largely been replaced by contingent and part-time\nservice-sector jobs, which tend to be poorly paid and lack health and\nretirement benefits. The corresponding reduction in real wages has had\na disproportionate effect on women, and especially women of color, who\nhold a higher share of service-sector jobs (Jaggar 2001, 2002a). \n\nIn the global South, foreign-owned manufacturing and assembly\nproduction facilities have proliferated in free trade zones, forming\nwhat is often referred to as the \u201cglobal assembly line.\u201d\nHistorically, foreign-dominated industrial expansion has meant more\njobs for men; however, it is primarily women who comprise the new,\n\u201cinternational, industrial proletariat\u201d working on the\nglobal assembly line. Gendered and racial stereotypes have played an\nimportant role in the establishing this gendered division of labor. In\nparticular, employers tend to perceive women, particularly Asian\nwomen, as \u201ctractable, hard-working, dexterous\u2014and\nsexy\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 305). Governments have been quick to\ncapitalize on these perceptions in their efforts to recruit foreign\ninvestment.\n\nProponents of globalization argue that the expansion of export\nprocessing has had positive consequences for women, providing jobs for\nthousands of otherwise unemployed women and offering new forms of\nagency. However, feminist political philosophers argue that jobs on\nthe global assembly line tend to be difficult, insecure, and\ndangerous: working conditions are poor, hours are long, wages are low,\nand sexual harassment is widespread (Young 2007, 164\u201367). Thus,\nthey contend, the results for women are contradictory at best. As\nJaggar argues, while women\u2019s increased economic power may\nprovide them with some freedom within their families, they are also\n\u201csuper-exploited by foreign corporations with the collusion of\ntheir own governments. As employees, they often experience a type of\nlabor control that is almost feudal in its requirement of subservience\nand dependence\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 306).\n\nTrade liberalization policies have also allowed affluent, northern\ncountries to sell heavily subsidized agricultural products in southern\nmarkets, leading to the decline of small-scale and subsistence\nfarming. Many of the female farmers who have been pushed off their\nland have sought employment in export-processing zones or as seasonal\nlaborers, at lower wages than their male counterparts. Others have\nfound poorly paid and often dangerous jobs in the informal economy\n(Jaggar 2001, 2002a).\n\nFeminist political philosophers are also concerned with the gendered\neffects of structural adjustment policies (SAPs), which many poor\ncountries have been forced to undertake as conditions of borrowing\nmoney or rescheduling their existing debts. The resulting reductions\nin publicly-funded health services, education, and childcare undermine\nthe health and well-being of everyone they affect. However, the\nburdens of SAPs are disproportionately borne by women. Cuts in public\nhealth services have contributed to a rise in maternal mortality. The\nintroduction of school fees has made education unavailable to poorer\nchildren, especially to girls, leading to higher school dropout rates\nfor girls in many southern countries (Kittay 2008). Cuts to other\npublicly funded social services also disproportionately harm women,\nwhose care-giving responsibilities make them more reliant on these\nprograms. Because austerity programs decrease public support for women\nand increase women\u2019s workload, programs like these put women at\ngreater risk for some mental health disorders (Gosselin 2014).\n\nMore broadly, SAPs have contributed to increases in poverty and\nunemployment in developing countries, placing additional burdens on\nwomen within both the household and the public sphere. In times of\neconomic difficulty, men tend to maintain their expenditures, while\nwomen are expected to make ends meet with fewer resources.\nConsequently, women have had to develop survival strategies for their\nfamilies, often picking up the caregiving labor that is no longer\nprovided by the state. Women also face intensified pressure to earn\nincome outside the home. Some women who have been unable to find\nadequate employment in their own countries have turned to labor\nmigration, which we discuss below. Sex work, including child\nprostitution, has also increased under these conditions (Schutte\n2002). \n\nBrock argues that reforming the international tax regime is a matter\nof global gender justice. In her view, global gender justice arises\nonly when all people are able to meet their basic needs, have equal\nprotection for basic liberties, and enjoy fair terms of cooperation in\ncollective endeavors. Because properly funded social and political\ninstitutions are a precondition of gender justice, a fair system of\ninternational taxation and just accounting practices is needed to\nachieve it. Although the claim that international taxation is a\nrequirement of global gender justice might initially seem odd, Brock\nargues that a fair international tax regime is necessary to prevent\nthe harms that women in the global South suffer when public services\nare underfunded. In her view, all corporations should pay their fair\nshare of taxes so countries can fund education, infrastructure\ndevelopment, and programs that promote gender equity. Tax havens which\nallow corporations to evade paying their taxes\u2014so much so that\nfor every dollar of aid that flows into a country, six to seven\ndollars of corporate taxes are evaded\u2014must be eliminated.\nWithout such reforms, we must conclude that the basic institutional\nstructure of the global economy remains unjust and detrimental to\nwomen (Brock 2014).\n3.2 Migration\n\nMigration has accelerated along with the globalization of the economy\nand women comprise a higher proportion of migrants, especially labor\nmigrants, and refugees than ever before. Feminist philosophical\nresponses to the feminization of migration fall into three general\nlines of argument. Early work in this area highlights the ways in\nwhich gender, race, class, culture, and immigration status intersect\nto produce disproportionate burdens for immigrant women. Subsequent\nwork discusses the feminization of labor migration, with a focus on\ndomestic workers. Finally, more recent contributions explore the\nrelationship between transnational migration and various forms of\nstructural oppression.\n\nEarly work by feminist philosophers typically argues that in sexist,\nracist, and class-divided societies, such as the United States,\nformally gender-neutral immigration policies often work to the\ndetriment of immigrant women (Narayan 1995, Wilcox 2005). For\ninstance, Uma Narayan argues that U.S. immigration legislation, such\nas the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendment (IMFA) heightens immigrant\nwomen\u2019s vulnerability to domestic violence. Before the IMFA was\nadopted, when a citizen or legal permanent resident married a\nforeigner and petitioned for permanent residency status for his\nspouse, legal residency was granted fairly quickly. The IMFA changed\nthis process, adding a two-year period of \u201cconditional\nresidency,\u201d during which the couple must remain married, and\nrequiring both spouses to petition for adjustment to permanent\nresidency status at the end of this waiting period. Narayan argues\nthat the IMFA increases the already significant barriers to escaping\nabusive marriages for immigrant women because it ties immigration\nstatus to marriage. This is especially problematic because immigrant\nwomen are generally \u201ceconomically, psychologically, and\nlinguistically dependent on their spouses\u201d (Narayan 1995,\n106).\n\nMore recent approaches to the feminization of global migration focus\non what Arlie Hochschild refers to as \u201cglobal care chains\u201d\n(Hochschild 2000, 2002) These chains, which link women across the\nworld, are established through the transnational exchange of domestic\nservices. Global care chains typically begin when relatively well-off\nnorthern or Western women enter the paid labor force and hire other\nwomen, usually poorer women from developing countries, to care for\ntheir children and other dependents. Migrant careworkers often must\nleave their own children behind in their home countries to be cared\nfor by even poorer careworkers or family members who may already have\ncare-giving responsibilities or be engaged with paid labor. Many\nfactors have contributed to the production of global care chains. In\nwealthy countries, the entry of women into the paid workforce, without\ncorresponding increases in public provisions for childcare or the\nredistribution of caring responsibilities between genders, has created\na high demand for paid domestic labor. In poor countries, the supply\nof domestic labor has been stimulated by a scarcity of well-paying\njobs and in many cases, a growing reliance on remittances. Cuts in\npublic services in southern countries have also encouraged women to\nmigrate as a means for earning the income they need to pay for private\nservices for their children, such as healthcare and education (Kittay,\n2008, 2009).\n\nGlobal care chains raise difficult issues for feminists, over and\nabove those raised by the background injustices that help to generate\nthem. In particular, some northern women are able to take advantage of\nincreased opportunities in the paid workforce only because southern\nwomen take up their socially-assigned domestic work, leaving their own\nfamilies in the care of others. Global care chains also contribute to\na larger, neo-colonial process \u2013 a \u201cglobal care\ndrain,\u201d in which care is systematically extracted from people in\npoor countries and transferred to individuals in affluent nations\n(Hochschild 2002). \n\nFeminist analyses of care chains typically argue that traditional\ntheories of justice have difficulty articulating the precise nature of\nthe harms or injustices involved in these phenomena. Most theories of\nglobal justice focus on unjust distributions of benefits and burdens\namong nations; however, it is not clear that care should be understood\nas a distributive good. Other features of care chains also resist\ntraditional ethical evaluation. Careworkers are not overtly coerced to\nmigrate, and each party in the global care chain appears to benefit\nfrom her participation: women who employ migrant caregivers are able\nto pursue opportunities in the public sphere; migrant caregivers are\nable to send money home; and their children and sending nations\nbenefit economically from these remittances. Migrant caregivers\nclearly are vulnerable to exploitation and workplace abuses, and they\nand their children suffer from their long absences. However, it could\nbe argued that each of these harms is counterbalanced by significant\ngains (Kittay, 2008, 2009). \n\nSome feminists argue that a feminist ethics of care is better suited\nto theorizing global care chains. In particular, care ethics\nemphasizes several key normative features and practices that\ntraditional theories tend to overlook: concrete specificity;\nacknowledgement of human dependence and vulnerability; and a\nrelational understanding of the self (Kittay, 2008). Care ethics\nfocuses on the ethical significance of relationships formed through\ndependency, such as those between caregivers and their charges. Kittay\nargues that intimate relationships between specific individuals, in\nwhich caring and affection are the norm, play a vital role in forming\nand sustaining individuals\u2019 self-identities. When these\nrelationships are disrupted, people suffer harm to their sense of self\nand self-respect. It follows that the harm involved in global care\nchains lies in their threat to the core relationships that are\nconstitutive of self-identity. \n\nTo protect dependents and caregivers from the harms that flow from\nfractured relationships, Kittay believes the right to give and receive\ncare should be recognized as a basic human right. Weir agrees that\ndismantling global care chains requires recognizing care as \u201can\nintrinsic good, a source of identity and meaning, which should be\nrecognized as a human right\u201d (Weir 2005, 313). However, both\nalso suggest that the recognition of a properly formulated right to\ncare would not eliminate global care chains on its own. Care chains\nwill persist until care, whether provided by professionals or within\nfamily networks, is socially recognized and economically supported.\nCaregiving responsibilities should also be more fairly distributed\nbetween genders and paid work should be organized with the recognition\nthat all workers\u2014male and female, rich and poor\u2014are\nresponsible for providing care. Unlocking care chains will also\nrequire mitigating the unjust background conditions that force women\nto choose between providing financial support for their families and\nbeing with and providing face to face care for them. To begin,\nimmigration policies must include specific provisions that make it\neasier for careworkers to bring their children or return home on a\nregular basis. Ultimately, however, eliminating care chains will\nrequire restructuring the global economy so that no one is forced to\nleave her home country to find decent working and living\nconditions.\n\nFinally, many recent feminist philosophical analyses of migration\nexplore the relationship between transnational migration and various\nforms of structural injustice, including gender oppression, racism and\nwhite supremacy, global economic inequality, militarization, and\nlegacies of colonialism. For instance, Wilcox argues that\ntransnational injustices generate strong moral claims to admission for\ncertain groups of prospective migrants. She advances two arguments for\nthis claim. The first contends that the principle of collective\npolitical responsibility obligates states to grant admission priority\nto prospective migrants who have been seriously harmed by their\npolicies, including economic policies that disproportionately harm\nwomen and marginalized workers in less affluent countries (Wilcox\n2007). Her second argument maintains that a commitment to relational\negalitarianism entails rejecting immigration restrictions that\ncontribute to oppressive transnational structural relations. In the\ncontext of gendered and racialized global supply chains, this includes\nthose restrictions on labor migration that increase workers\u2019\nvulnerability to exploitation, domination, violence, and\nmarginalization (Wilcox 2012).\n\nOther feminists focus on the relationship between structural injustice\nand refugee determination. In particular, they argue that legal\ndefinitions of refugeehood are insufficiently attentive to\ngender-based injustices, leading to the wrongful exclusion of\nvulnerable migrants who have strong moral claims to asylum. For\ninstance, Parekh argues that despite feminist gains in expanding\ninternational refugee conventions to recognize gender-related\npersecution, many states sill regard some forms of gender injustice as\ntoo apolitical or insignificant to warrant asylum (Parekh 2012).\nAccounting for the ways in which structural injustices modulate and\namplify gender-based harms can lead to more inclusive\u2014and better\njustified\u2014conceptualizations of gender persecution. Similarly,\nMeyers argues that an adequate understanding of the coercive nature of\nsevere poverty supports broadening the conventional definition of\nrefugeehood to include economic refugees, many of whom are women\n(Meyers 2014). Using the work of Iris Marion Young, Parekh further\nargues that understanding the harms from which refugees flee as forms\nof structural injustice grounds stronger moral obligations to help\nrefugees, both those who remain in the global South an those who seek\nadmission to Western states (Parekh 2017, 2020).\n\nFeminists also warn that migration regimes tend to reinforce existing\nforms of domination and even create new types of oppression. More\nspecifically, they argue that migration, refugee, and citizenship\ndiscourses, policies, and practices often draw upon pernicious\nstereotypes and entho-nationalist tropes to construct gendered and\nracialized subjects that are, in turn, mobilized to justify the\ndomination, exclusion, and marginalization of the individuals they are\nthought to represent. For instance, Cisneros argues that recent U.S.\npolitical debates about so-called \u201canchor babies\u201d draw\nupon sexist and nationalist conceptions of women as reproducers of the\nethnic nation, together with the racist notion of the \u201cillegal\nalien,\u201d to portray migrant women, particularly undocumented\nwomen, as an existential threat to the (white supremacist) nation\n(Cisneros 2013). This fictive subject is then taken to justify\ncoercive immigration and citizenship policies designed to exclude\nmigrant women of color and bar even U.S. born children of unauthorized\nmigrants from citizenship. Similarly, Reed-Sandoval argues that the\nU.S. immigration regime, which she views as a \u201csocial-historical\nracial project that served to reorganize and redistribute resources by\nmeans of branding certain bodies as \u2019illegals\u2019 in the\nUnited States,\u201d has generated a unique social identity, which\nshe calls \u201cbeing socially undocumented\u201d (Reed-Sandoval\n2020, 86). Being socially undocumented is distinct from being legally\nundocumented in that it does not necessarily involve a lack of legal\nauthorization, but rather membership in the social group of people who\nare subject to a common set of unjust, self-legitimating,\n\u201cillegalizing,\u201d immigration-related constraints, including\nracial profiling and police harassment, offensive stereotypes, and\nexploitative and degrading employment practices, on the basis of being\nperceived to be undocumented, regardless of immigration status.\nFinally, Oliver argues that that so-called humanitarian responses to\nthe contemporary refugee crisis are governed by a similar\nself-justifying logic, which she calls carceral humanitarianism\n(Oliver 2017a, 2017b). According to this logic, refugees can\njustifiably be sorted into groups based on their perceived risk to\nhost societies, made to prove the trauma that constitutes their case\nfor asylum, confined to detention centers and refugee camps\nindefinitely, subjected to violence and denied basic human rights, and\nin many cases, treated like terrorist threats or prisoners of war.\nMerged with rescue politics, which represents refugees as helpless\nvictims to be rescued and saved, carceral humanitarianism \u201cturns\nrefugees into criminals and charity cases simultaneously, which, in\nturn, becomes the troubling justification for locking them up or\nlocking them in, increasingly in dangerous, disease-ridden and sorely\ninadequate conditions\u201d (Oliver 2017b, 185).\n3.3 Human Rights\n\nThe term \u2018human rights\u2019 refers simultaneously to several\nthings: a moral language; a set of norms and laws, both national and\ninternational; and a framework for analyzing and responding to the\nvarious serious harms experienced by men and women around the world.\nFeminist political philosophers argue that globalization has had\ncontradictory effects on the extent to which women experience human\nrights violations.\n\nMany feminist political philosophers have argued that globalization\nhas contributed to human rights violations against women. Most\nobviously, neoliberal policies have led to infringements of specific\nsocial and economic rights, such as the right \u201cto a standard of\nliving adequate for the health and well-being\u201d and the right\n\u201cto security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability,\nwidowhood, and old age\u201d (Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\narticle 25). Moreover, by diminishing women\u2019s economic security,\nneoliberal policies have exacerbated existing forms of gender\ndiscrimination and violence and made women and girls more vulnerable\nto a wide variety of additional human rights violations. Three\nexamples are prominent in the literature. First, the economic\ninsecurity and concomitant increase in poverty associated with\nglobalization have made girls more vulnerable to sexual exploitation.\nIn particular, girls are more likely to be sold as child brides or\npushed into prostitution or sexual slavery in order to support their\nfamilies (Okin 1998, 45). Second, when resources are scarce, women and\ngirls are less likely to receive food than boys and men and are less\nlikely to attend school. Finally, Shiva argues that neoliberal\nglobalization has made women more vulnerable to sexual violence. She\nnotes the extraordinary increase in rape in India: 800 percent since\nthe 1970s and an additional 250 percent since the economy was\nliberalized (Morgan 2013). Although the reasons for this rise are\ncomplex, Shiva believes they are connected to several aspects of\nglobalization: structural adjustment policies, which eliminated major\nsectors of women\u2019s economic activity; the destruction of the\nnatural environment, which displaced many women; and the exclusion of\nwomen from economic and political decision-making.\n\nMore positively, some feminist philosophers contend that globalization\nhas enabled women to claim their human rights by creating \u201cnew\nspaces, institutions and rhetoric where the notion of universal human\nrights is a powerful justificatory principle\u201d (Walby 2002, 534).\nOthers credit globalization for the emergence of new international\nnon-governmental organizations and feminist social movements, which\nhave strengthened the worldwide movement for women\u2019s human\nrights (Robinson 2003, 161). The \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human\nrights\u201d movement has used the language of human rights, which\nsome proponents believe provides \u201cthe best chance of realizing\nthe long sought after goal of gender equality,\u201d to criticize\nmany assaults on women\u2019s dignity that were previously considered\nto be natural or inevitable (Panzer 2009, 45). For instance, the\nmovement has shown that abuses in the private sphere, such as domestic\nviolence, so-called \u201chonor killings,\u201d and violence done in\nthe name of culture or tradition, are legitimate human rights\nviolations. Others have argued that cultural practices like female\ngenital cutting (FGC), which many consider to be human rights\nviolations, can be made compatible with universal human rights if\ncertain conditions are met (Gordon 2018). The movement also helped to\ncodify women\u2019s human rights in formal United Nations documents,\nsuch as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Declaration on the\nElimination of Violence Against Women, which activist groups have\nsubsequently used to challenge domestic laws and norms (Stamatopoulou\n1995). However, as McLaren points out, it is important to attend to\nthe critiques made by feminists in the global South that social and\neconomic rights, rights that are particularly important to women in\nthe global South, have been marginalized in Western feminist\ndiscourse. This critique can be accounted for, McLaren argues, if we\nadopt an integrated approach to rights that both insists on the\nindivisibility of human rights and acknowledges their ambivalence. If\nhuman rights are to realize their liberatory potential, we must\nrecognize that human rights can reinforce injustice as well as\nundermine it (McLaren 2017b). \n\nWomen\u2019s human rights movements have also had an impact on\ninternational understandings of the gendered consequences of war and\nmilitarization. In UN forums and other global venues, feminists have\nchallenged international human rights laws concerning rape and sexual\nviolence in war. As Copelon explained in 2003, \u201c[l]ess than a\ndecade ago, it was openly questioned whether rape was a war crime.\nHuman rights and humanitarian organizations largely ignored sexual\nviolence and the needs of its victims\u201d (Copelon, 1). However, by\n2002, feminists had successfully convinced the authors of the Rome\nStatute to include a broad range of sexually violent crimes among the\ngravest crimes of war. The document considers rape, forced pregnancy,\nsexual assault, and forced prostitution to be \u201ccrimes against\nhumanity\u201d if they are committed as part of a widespread or\nsystematic attack on civilian populations, in times of war as well as\npeace, by non-state actors as well as official state actors. The\nStatute\u2019s definition of rape goes a long way toward recognizing\nrape as a gender-based atrocity on par with other long-recognized\natrocities, such as torture and genocide (Parekh 2009). Arguably,\nthese changes in international law would not have been possible\nwithout transnational activism, which can clearly be seen as an\nexample of \u201cglobalization from below.\u201d\n3.4 Democracy and Global Governance\n\nAs with human rights, feminist philosophers have argued that\nglobalization has contradictory implications for democratic\ngovernance. On the one hand, neoliberalism has diminished national\nsovereignty, further excluding women and the poor from democratic\nprocesses (Herr 2003). Yet globalization also connects people across\nnational borders, creating transnational communities that offer new\navenues for democratic participation. \n\nGlobalization has been accompanied by the establishment of formal\ndemocracy in some countries and the number of women serving in\nnational legislatures has increased in some nations. However, some\nfeminist philosophers are quick to argue that neoliberalism has not\nresulted in increased political influence for women on the whole,\nespecially at the level of global politics. One important reason is\nthat global economic institutions are neither adequately\nrepresentative nor fully democratic. Women are virtually absent from\nthe formal decision-making bodies of institutions such as the WTO and\nthe World Bank, and these institutions tend to be unofficially\ndominated by the interests of wealthy nations and multinational\ncorporations. \n\nFeminists argue that women\u2019s lack of political influence at the\nglobal level has not been compensated for by their increased influence\nin national politics because globalization has undermined national\nsovereignty, especially in poor nations. Structural adjustment\npolicies require debtor nations to implement specific domestic\npolicies that disproportionately harm women, such as austerity\nmeasures, despite strong local opposition. Trade rules issued by the\nWorld Trade Organization also supersede the national laws of signatory\nnations, including those pertaining to matters of ethics and public\npolicy, such as environmental protections and health and safety\nstandards for imported goods, as well as trade tariffs (Jaggar 2001,\n2002a). \n\nNor does women\u2019s participation in NGOs or other organizations\nwithin civil society guarantee that their interests will be fairly\nrepresented. Indeed, some feminists charge that foreign-funded NGOs\nare \u201ca new form of colonialism because they create dependence on\nnonelected overseas funders and their locally appointed officials,\nundermining the development of social programs administered by elected\nofficials accountable to local people\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 309). Even\nlocal, women-run NGOs sometimes fail to live up to their democratic\naspirations. NGO projects are often shaped by the agendas of their\ncorporate funders, to the detriment of the expressed needs of the\nwomen they serve. Demands for accountability to donors also limit the\ninternal democracy of NGOs by encouraging the professionalization of\ngrassroots organizations (Jaggar 2001, 2005a).\n\nWhile feminist philosophers agree that globalization has concentrated\npower in the hands of wealthy nations and corporations, further\nmarginalizing women and the global poor, some believe the conditions\nof globalization also enable new forms of democratic accountability.\nFor instance, Gould argues that participants in transnational\nassociations have equal rights to participate in decisions about their\ncommon activities. She also suggests that the Internet and other\ncommunication and information technologies, such open source software\nand online deliberative forums, can \u201chelp to increase both\ndemocratic participation and representation in the functioning of\ntransnational institutions\u201d (Gould 2009, 38).\n\nFraser (2009) further suggests that globalization has created new\ntransnational public spheres in which public opinion can be created\nand marshaled to hold political leaders democratically accountable.\nTraditional public sphere theory, such as that developed by Habermas,\ndefines the public sphere as an area of social life in which\nindividuals come together to reach a common public opinion about\nsocial issues. Insofar as the process of deliberation is fair and\ninclusive, the resulting public opinion is normatively legitimate;\nbecause it expresses the considered will of civil society, it can be\nmobilized as a political force to hold public power democratically\naccountable.\n\nHowever, Fraser points out that these essential features of\npublicity\u2014normative legitimacy and political efficacy\u2014are\nnot easily associated with new transnational communicative arenas, in\nwhich territorially dispersed interlocutors interact through various\ndiscursive forms. The reason is that traditional public sphere theory\nimplicitly assumes a Westaphalian political model, in which\nco-citizens, with equal rights to participate, create public opinion\naddressed to a particular state. Thus, in her words:\n\n[i]t is difficult to associate the notion of legitimate public opinion\nwith communicative arenas in which the interlocutors are not fellow\nmembers of a political community, with equal rights to participate in\npolitical life. And it is hard to associate the notion of efficacious\ncommunicative power with discursive spaces that do not correlate with\nsovereign states (Fraser 2009, 77).\n\n\nNevertheless, she argues, we should not jettison the idea of a\ntransnational public sphere, provided that the notions of normative\nlegitimacy and political efficacy can be reformulated to apply to\ncommunication in transnational discursive arenas.\n4. Conclusion\n\nOn the whole, globalization presents a number of challenges to\nfeminist political philosophers who seek to develop conceptions of\njustice and responsibility capable of responding to the lived\nrealities of both men and women. As globalization will most certainly\ncontinue, these challenges are likely to increase in the coming\ndecades. As we have outlined above, feminist political philosophers\nhave already made great strides towards understanding this complex\nphenomenon. Yet the challenge of how to make globalization fairer\nremains for feminist philosophers, as well as all others who strive\nfor equality and justice.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackerly, B., 2009, \u201cFeminist Theory, Global Gender Justice,\nand the Evaluation of Grant Making,\u201d <em>Philosophical\nTopics</em>, 37(2): 179\u2013198.", "Ackerly, B., and Attanasi, K., 2009, \u201cGlobal Feminisms:\nTheory and Ethics for Studying Gendered Injustice,\u201d <em>New\nPolitical Science</em>, 31(4): 543\u2013555.", "Alcoff, L., 2009, \u201cDiscourses of Sexual Violence in a Global\nFramework,\u201d <em>Philosophical Topics</em>, 37(2):\n123\u2013139.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, \u201cDecolonizing Feminist\nPhilosophy,\u201d in <em>Decolonizing Feminism: Transnational\nFeminism and Globalization</em>, M.
