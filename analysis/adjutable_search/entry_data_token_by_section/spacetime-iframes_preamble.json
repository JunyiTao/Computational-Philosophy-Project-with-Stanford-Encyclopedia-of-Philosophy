    "main_text": "\n\nA \u201cframe of reference\u201d is a standard relative to which\nmotion and rest may be measured; any set of points or objects that are\nat rest relative to one another enables us, in principle, to describe\nthe relative motions of bodies. A frame of reference is therefore a\npurely kinematical device, for the geometrical description of motion\nwithout regard to the masses or forces involved. A dynamical account\nof motion leads to the idea of an \u201cinertial frame,\u201d or a\nreference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamical\nproperties. For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood as\na spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time,\nso that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions.\nThe laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition: an\ninertial frame is a reference-frame with a time-scale, relative to\nwhich the motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinear\nand uniform, accelerations are always proportional to and in the\ndirection of applied forces, and applied forces are always met with\nequal and opposite reactions. It follows that, in an inertial frame,\nthe center of mass of a closed system of interacting bodies is always\nat rest or in uniform motion. It also follows that any other frame of\nreference moving uniformly relative to an inertial frame is also an\ninertial frame. For example, in Newtonian celestial mechanics, taking\nthe \u201cfixed stars\u201d as a frame of reference, we can, in\nprinciple, determine an (approximately) inertial frame whose center is\nthe center of mass of the solar system; relative to this frame, every\nacceleration of every planet can be accounted for (approximately) as a\ngravitational interaction with some other planet in accord with\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion.\n\nThis appears to be a simple and straightforward concept. By inquiring\nmore narrowly into its origins and meaning, however, we begin to\nunderstand why it has been an ongoing subject of philosophical\nconcern. It originated in a profound philosophical consideration of\nthe principles of relativity and invariance in the context of\nNewtonian mechanics. Further reflections on it, in different\ntheoretical contexts, had extraordinary consequences for\n20th-century theories of space and time.\n",
