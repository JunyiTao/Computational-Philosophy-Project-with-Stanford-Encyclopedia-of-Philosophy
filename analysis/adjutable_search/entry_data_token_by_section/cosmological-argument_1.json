    "main_text": "Typology of Cosmological Arguments\n2. Typology of Cosmological Arguments\n\nPhilosophers employ diverse classifications of the cosmological\narguments. Swinburne distinguishes inductive from deductive versions.\nCraig distinguishes three types of deductive cosmological arguments in\nterms of their approach to an infinite regress of causes. The first,\nadvocated by Aquinas, is based on the impossibility of an essentially\nordered infinite regress. The second, which Craig terms the\nkal\u0101m argument, holds that an infinite temporal regress\nof causes is impossible because an actual infinite is impossible, and\neven if it were possible it could not be temporally realized. The\nthird, espoused by Leibniz and Clarke, is overtly founded on the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason (Craig 1980: 282\u201383), although it\nappears that all versions use some form of that principle. Craig notes\nthat the distinction between these types of arguments is important\nbecause the objections raised against one version may be irrelevant to\nother versions. So, for example, a critique of a particular version of\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), which one finds developed by\nWilliam Rowe or Richard Gale, might not be telling against the\nThomistic or kal\u0101m versions of the argument. Another way\nof distinguishing between versions of the argument is in terms of the\nrelevance of time to the argument. In Aquinas\u2019s version,\nconsideration of the essential ordering of the causes or reasons\nproceeds independent of temporal concerns. The relationship between\ncause and effect is treated as real but not temporal, so that the\nfirst cause is not a first cause in time but a sustaining cause\n(Siniscalchi 2018: 691). In the kal\u0101m version, however,\nthe temporal ordering of the causal sequence is central, introducing\nissues of the nature of time into the discussion.\n",
