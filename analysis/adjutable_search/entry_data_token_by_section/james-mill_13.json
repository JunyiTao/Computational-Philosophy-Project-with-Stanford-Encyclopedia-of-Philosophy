    "main_text": "The Essay on Education || Education and Happiness\n7. Conclusion: Mill\u2019s Legacy\nIn\u00a01822, James Mackintosh found much that was admirable in Mill\u2019s essays on government and education. However, Mackintosh protested, they were founded on an erroneous method (Mackintosh to Napier, 1822). Less than a decade later, Macaulay devastatingly drew out the implications of that method for Mill\u2019s \u201cutilitarian logic and politics.\u201d In\u00a0 reviewing the quarrel between Mill and Macaulay today, the modern reader may well experience a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, not because the question of parliamentary reform remains relevant and timely, but because the epistemological and methodological questions raised by this debate are with us still. What is the nature of political knowledge, and how is it to be obtained? What sort of \u201cscience\u201d can \u201cpolitical science\u201d aspire to be? What is the connection between political theory and the practice of politics? Mill\u2019s answers rather resemble those of modern \u201crational choice\u201d theorists, and Macaulay\u2019s those of their empirically minded critics. After all, Mill maintains that any scientific theory worthy of the name must proceed from a finite set of assumptions about human nature, with the self-interest axiom at their center. From these one can deduce conclusions about the ways in which rational political actors will (or at any rate ought to) behave. Macaulay, by contrast, claims that people act for all sorts of reasons, including\u2014but by no means limited to\u2014considerations of self-interest.\nMill\u2019s Essay on Government\u2014and Macaulay\u2019s attack\u2014earned for its author an unenviable reputation as an egregious simplifier of complex matters. Yet Mill remained unrepentant since such simplification was, in his view, the very purpose and point of theorizing. After all, to theorize is to simplify. But, as his critics were quick to note, it is one thing to simplify and quite another to oversimplify. In a modern echo of Macaulay\u2019s estimate, Joseph Schumpeter contrasts Mill\u2019s \u201cmonumental, and indeed path-breaking, History of British India\u201d with the Essay on Government, which \u201ccan be described only as unrelieved nonsense\u201d because of its simplistic assumptions and its equally simplistic conclusions (Schumpeter 1954, 254). A more charitable estimate is provided by Brian Barry. Barry observes:\nThe results [of Mill\u2019s reasoning] may appear somewhat crude, and yet it seems to me a serious question whether James Mill\u2019s political theory is any more of an oversimplification than, say, Ricardo\u2019s economics. The difference is, of course, that Ricardo\u2019s ideas were refined by subsequent theorists, whereas James Mill\u2019s Essay on Government had no successors until the last decade or so (Barry 1970, 11).\nThese successors, on Barry\u2019s telling, include such rational choice theorists as Mancur Olson and Anthony Downs, amongst others. Alan Ryan concurs. Although \u201can eminently dislikable document,\u201d Ryan writes, Mill\u2019s Essay on Government \u201chas virtues that ought not to be neglected.\u201d One of these is that it \u201cstands at the head of a line of thought extending down to Joseph Schumpeter and Anthony Downs, a line of thought that provides many of the explicit or implicit assumptions with the aid of which we still practice political science\u201d (Ryan 1972, 82\u201383).\nAlthough right in one respect, Barry\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s reassessments are rather wide of the mark in another. It is true that there is, methodologically speaking, a family resemblance between Mill\u2019s axiomatic deductive reasoning in Government and, say, Anthony Downs\u2019s An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957). But it is important to note that Mill, unlike Downs and other ostensible successors of the rational choice school, was never content to interpret interests as wants, desires or \u201crevealed preferences.\u201d On the contrary, Mill was concerned with distinguishing between sinister and non-sinister interests, supplying causal explanations of their origins and development, rendering judgments about them, and attempting to alter the conditions that shape (or more often misshape) men\u2019s and women\u2019s characters. Hence his abiding interest in law, education, punishment, penology, psychology, and other avenues of \u201ccharacter-formation.\u201d Mill\u2019s aims were not only explanatory but critical, educative, and, by his lights, emancipatory. The point of almost everything he wrote\u2014from his massive \u201ccritical, or judging\u201d History of British India to the shortest essay\u2014was, to borrow a phrase from Marx, not merely to understand the world but to change it. Not for Mill the vaunted \u201cvalue-neutrality\u201d of modern social and political science.\n",
