    "main_text": "The Plurality of Causal Concepts\n7. The Plurality of Causal Concepts\n\nA second respect in which reliance on the notion of an intervention\nneed not be thought of as introducing a vicious circularity is this:\nSo far, I have been following Menzies and Price in assuming that there\nis just one causal notion or locution \\((A\\) causes \\(B\\), where \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are types of events) that we are trying to analyze. But in\nfact there are many such notions. For example, among causal notions\nbelonging to the family of so-called type causal notions (i.e., causal\nclaims that relate types of events or variables) there is a\ndistinction to be drawn between what we might call claims about total\nor net causes and claims about direct causes. Even if the notion of an\nintervention presupposes some causal notion such as some notion of\ntype causation, it may be that we can use it to characterize other\ncausal notions.\n\nAs an illustration consider the causal structure represented by the\nfollowing equations and associated directed graph\n\n\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nY & = aX + cZ\\\\\n Z & = bX\\\\\n \n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this structure, there are two different causal routes from \\(X\\) to\n\\(Y\\)\u2014a direct causal relationship and an indirect relationship\nwith \\(Z\\) as an intermediate variable. If \\(a = {-bc}\\), there is\ncancellation along these two routes. This means that no intervention\non \\(X\\) will change the value of \\(Y\\). In one natural sense, this\nseems to mean that \\(X\\) does not cause \\(Y\\), assuming that (C*) a\nnecessary condition for \\(X\\) to cause \\(Y\\) is that some\ninterventions on \\(X\\) are associated with changes in the value of\n\\(Y,\\) as an obvious extension of CD seems to suggest. In another\nnatural sense, however, \\(X\\) does seem to be a cause\u2014indeed a\ndirect cause\u2014of \\(Y\\). We can resolve this apparent\ninconsistency by distinguishing between two kinds of causal claims\n(for a related distinction, see Hitchcock 2001b )\u2014the claim\n\\(X\\) is a total or net cause of \\(Y\\), where this is captured by (C*)\nand the claim that \\(X\\) is a direct cause of \\(Y\\), where this is\nunderstood along the following lines: \\(X\\) is a direct cause of \\(Y\\)\nif and only if under some intervention that changes the value of\n\\(X\\), the value of \\(Y\\) changes when all other variables in the\nsystem of interest distinct from \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) including those that\nare on some causal route from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), are held fixed at some\nvalue, also by interventions. (For related, but different,\ncharacterizations of direct causation along these lines, see Pearl\n2009 and Woodward 2003.) Fixing the other values of other variables\nmeans that each of these values is fixed by separate interventions\nthat are independent of each other and of the intervention that\nchanges the value of \\(X\\). The effect of intervening to fix the\nvalues of these variables is thus that each variable intervened on is\ndisconnected from its causes, including \\(X\\). In the example under\ndiscussion, \\(X\\) qualifies as a direct cause of \\(Y\\) because if we\nwere to fix the value of \\(Z\\) in a way that disconnects it from the\nvalue of \\(X\\), and then intervene to change the value of \\(X\\), the\nvalue of \\(Y\\) would change. This idea can then be generalized to\nprovide a characterization of \u201ccontributing\u201d causation\nalong a causal route, i.e., to capture the sense in which \\(X\\) is an\nindirect cause of \\(Y\\) along the route that goes through \\(Z\\)\n(Woodward 2003).\n\nSo far our focus has been on type causal claims of various kinds.\nThere are also a number of proposals in the literature that provide\ninterventionist treatments of token or actual cause claims (these have\nto do with the event of \\(X\\)\u2019s taking on a particular value\nbeing an actual cause of \\(Y\\)\u2019s taking on a particular value,\nas when it is claimed that Jones\u2019 smoking caused his lung\ncancer), including those that involve various forms of pre-emption and\nover-determination (e.g., Halpern and Pearl 2005 a, b; ; Hitchcock\n2001a; Woodward 2003; Hitchcock 2007a; Hall 2007; Glymour and Wimberly\n2007; Halpern and Hitchcock 2015; Halpern 2016; Weslake 2013 [Other\nInternet Resources]). Considerations of space preclude detailed\ndescription, but one strategy that has been explored is to appeal to\nwhat will happen to the effect under combinations of\ninterventions that both affect the cause and that fix certain other\nvariables to specific values. As an illustration, consider a standard\ncase of causal pre-emption: Gunman one shoots \\((s_1)\\) victim,\ncausing his death \\(d\\), while gunman two does not shoot but would\nhave shot \\((s_2)\\) also causing \\(d\\), if \\(s_1\\) had not occurred.\nIf we fix (via an intervention) the behavior of the gunman two at its\nactual value (he does not shoot), then an independent intervention\nthat alters whether gunman one shoots will alter whether victim dies,\nthus identifying \\(s_1\\) as the actual cause of \\(d\\), despite the\nabsence of counterfactual dependence (of the usual sort) between \\(d\\)\nand \\(s_1\\). Accounts along these lines are able to deal with a number\n(although admittedly not all; see Hitchcock 2007a for details) of the\nstandard counterexamples to other counterfactual treatments of token\ncausation.\n\nIt is worth adding that although this appeal to combinations of\ninterventions may seem artificial, it maps on to standard experimental\nprocedures in an intuitive way. Consider a case of genetic\nredundancy\u2014gene complex \\(G_1\\) is involved in causing\nphenotypic trait \\(P\\) but if \\(G_1\\) is inactivated another gene\ncomplex \\(G_2\\) (which is inactive when \\(G_1\\) is active) will become\nactive and will cause \\(P\\). The geneticist may test for this\npossibility by, first, intervening on \\(G_2\\) so that it is fixed at\nthe value = inactive, then intervening to vary \\(G_1\\) and observing\nwhether there is a corresponding change in \\(P\\). Second, the\ninvestigator may intervene to render \\(G_1\\) inactive and then,\nindependently of this intervening to change \\(G_2\\) and observing\nwhether there is a change in \\(P\\). As this example illustrates, we\nmay think of different complex causal structures in which there are\nmultiple pathways, redundancy, cancellation and so on, as encoding\ndifferent sets of claims about what will happen under various possible\ncombinations of interventions.\n\nThus even if a \u201cmanipulationist\u201d or\n\u201cinterventionist\u201d framework does not yield a reduction of\ncausal talk to non-causal talk, it provides a natural way of marking\nthe distinctions among a number of different causal notions and\nexhibiting their interrelations. More generally, even if a\nmanipulationist account of causation does not yield a reduction but\ninstead simply connects \u201ccausation\u201d (or better, various\nmore specific causal concepts) with other concepts within the same\ncircle, we still face many non-trivial choices about how the concepts\non this circle are to be elucidated and connected up with one another.\nFor example, it is far from obvious how to characterize the notion of\nan intervention so as to avoid the various counterexamples to a\nversion of the manipulability theory like that of Menzies and Price.\nIt is in part because the notion of manipulation/intervention has an\ninteresting and complex fine structure\u2014a structure that is left\nlargely unexplored in traditional manipulability theories-- that\nworking out the connection between causation and manipulation turns\nout to be interesting and non-trivial rather than banal and\nobvious.\n",
