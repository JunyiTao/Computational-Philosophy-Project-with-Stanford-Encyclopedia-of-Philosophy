If, as it is natural to think,\u2018is\nobservable\u2019 is a vague predicate, we should not expect there to\nbe a precise demarcation between what\u2019s observable and\nwhat\u2019s unobservable. Observability can still serve as a useful\nconcept in the philosophy of science, as long as there are clear cases\nof observability and clear cases of unobservability.\n\nHere is one rough characterization of observability:\n\nX is observable if there are circumstances which are such\nthat, if X is present to us under those circumstances, then\nwe observe it (van Fraassen 1980, 16).\n\n\nFor the constructive empiricist, this characterization is \u201cnot\nmeant as a definition, but only as a rough guide to the avoidance of\nfallacies\u201d (van Fraassen 1980, 16). It is important to clarify\nthat, as a constructive empiricist would use the terminology, one only\nobserves something when the observation is unaided. One does\nnot see cells through a microscope; instead one sees an image, an\nimage which the scientific gnostic understands one way but the\nscientific agnostic understands a different way.\n\nNote that the observability of interest is relativized to\n\u201cus,\u201d the members of the epistemic community whose\nscientific theories are the topic of interest. Since what counts as\nobservable is relative to what epistemic community the observer is\npart of, and since the members of that epistemic community are the\nsubject of scientific theory, the constructive empiricist takes what\ncounts as observable as the subject of scientific theory and not\nsomething that can be determined a priori (van Fraassen 1980,\n56\u201359). Science itself, then, is ultimately the arbiter of what\ncounts as observable. For worries about circularity in the use of\naccepted scientific theory to determine which parts of the world are\nobservable (and hence to determine which theories of science are\nempirically adequate and thereby candidates for acceptance), see\nSection 3.7 below.\n",
