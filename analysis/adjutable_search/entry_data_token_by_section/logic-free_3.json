    "main_text": "Formal Systems\n2. Formal Systems\n\nLogics may be represented in various ways. Axiom systems, natural\ndeduction systems and trees (or, equivalently, tableaux) are among the\nmost common. This section presents all three for the bivalent\ninclusive form of free logic known as Positive Free Logic (PFL) and\nmentions some variants. (For the meaning of the term\n\u201cpositive\u201d in this context see\n Section 3.2).\n PFL is formulated in a first-order language \\(\\bL\\) without sentence\nletters or function symbols, whose primitive logical operators are\nnegation (not) \u2018\\({\\sim}\\)\u2019, the conditional (if-then)\n\u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019, the universal quantifier (for all)\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019, identity \u2018=\u2019 and\n\u2018E!\u2019, the others being defined as usual. We assume for the\nsake of definiteness that the formulas of \\(\\bL\\) are closed (contain\nno unquantified variables) and that they may be vacuously quantified\n(have the form \\(\\forall xA\\) or \\(\\exists xA\\), where \\(x\\) does not\noccur free in \\(A)\\). An occurrence of a variable is\nquantified if it lies within the scope of an operator such as\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019 that binds that\nvariable; otherwise it is free.\n",
