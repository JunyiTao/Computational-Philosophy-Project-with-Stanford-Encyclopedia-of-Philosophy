    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Philosophy || Background: Idealism as understood in the German tradition\n2.1 Background: Idealism as understood in the German tradition\n\u201cIdealism\u201d is a term that had been used sporadically by\nLeibniz and his followers to refer to a type of philosophy that was\nopposed to materialism. Thus, for example, Leibniz had\ncontrasted Plato as an idealist with Epicurus as a\nmaterialist. The opposition to materialism here, together with the\nfact that in the English-speaking world the Irish philosopher and\nclergyman George Berkeley (1685\u20131753) is often taken as a\nprototypical idealist, has given rise to the assumption that idealism\nis necessarily an immaterialist doctrine. This\nassumption, however, is mistaken. With the possible exception of\nLeibniz, the idealism of the Germans was not committed to the type of\ndoctrine found in Berkeley according to which immaterial minds, both\ninfinite (God\u2019s) and finite (those of humans), were the\nultimately real entities, with apparently material things to\nbe understood as reducible to states of such minds\u2014that\nis, to ideas in the sense meant by the British\nempiricists.\nAs Leibniz\u2019s use of Plato to exemplify idealism suggests,\nidealists in the German tradition tended to hold to the reality or\nobjectivity of ideas in the Platonic sense, and for Plato, it would\nseem, such ideas were not conceived as in any mind at\nall\u2014not even the mind of Plato\u2019s god. The type of\npicture found in Berkeley was only to be found in certain late antique\nPlatonists and, especially, early Christian Platonists like Saint\nAugustine, Bishop of Hippo. But especially for the German idealists\nlike Hegel, Plato\u2019s philosophy was understood through the lenses\nof more Aristotelian varieties of neo-Platonism, which pictured the\nthoughts of a divine mind as immanent in\nmatter, and not as contained in some purely immaterial or spiritual\nmind. It thus had features closer to the more pantheistic picture of\ndivine thought found in Spinoza, for example, for whom matter and mind\nwere attributes of the one substance.\nEven for Leibniz, whose later monadological metaphysics was perhaps\ncloser to Berkeley\u2019s immaterialist philosophy, an opposition to\nmaterialism didn\u2019t necessarily imply immaterialism. Leibniz had\nresisted Descartes\u2019 postulation of distinct spiritual and\nmaterial substances, treating corporeal bodies as inseparable\ncombinations of form and matter after the manner of Aristotle. The\nmaterialists to which he was opposed (mechanistic corpuscularists of\nhis time) conceived of unformed matter as a type of self-subsistent\nsubstance, and it seems to have been that conception to which\nhe was opposed, at least in some periods of his work, not the reality\nof matter per se. Leibniz\u2019s combination of Platonic and\nAristotelian notions played a role in the thought of the later\nidealists, giving their opposition to materialism its distinctive\ncharacter. These anti-immaterialist features of the idealism of the\nGermans became more prominent in the post-Kantian period as they moved\nprogressively away from the more subjectivistic features of\nLeibniz\u2019s thought (Beiser 2002).\n",
