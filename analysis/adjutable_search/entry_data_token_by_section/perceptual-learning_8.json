    "main_text": "Varieties of Perceptual Learning || Unitization\n2.2 Unitization\n\nUnitization is the counterpart to differentiation. In unitization, a\nperson comes to perceive as a single property, what they previously\nperceived as two or more distinct properties. One example of\nunitization is the perception of written words. When we perceive a\nwritten word in English, we do not simply perceive two or more\ndistinct letters. Rather, we perceive those letters as a single word.\nPut another way, we perceive written words as a single unit (see Smith\n& Haviland 1972). This is not the case with non-words. When we\nperceive short strings of letters that are not words, we do not\nperceive them as a single unit. Goldstone and Byrge provide a list of\nitems for which there is empirical evidence of such unitization: \n\n\nbirds, words, grids of lines, random wire structures, fingerprints,\nartificial blobs, and three-dimensional creatures made from simple\ngeometric components. (2015: 823)\n\n\nWhile unitization and differentiation are converses, the one unifying\nand the other distinguishing, Goldstone and Byrge also conceive of\nthem as \u201cflip sides of the same coin\u201d (2015: 823). This is\nbecause, as they put it, both unitization and differentiation\n\u201cinvolve creating perceptual units\u2026\u201d (2015: 823).\nRegardless of whether the unit arises from the fusion or the\ndifferentiation of two other units, both instances of perceptual\nlearning involve the creation of new perceptual units.\n",
