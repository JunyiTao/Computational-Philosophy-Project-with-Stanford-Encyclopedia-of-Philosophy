Parodies of Ontological Arguments\n\nPositive ontological arguments\u2014i.e., arguments FOR the existence\nof god(s)\u2014invariably admit of various kinds of parodies, i.e.,\nparallel arguments which seem at least equally acceptable to\nnon-theists, but which establish absurd or contradictory conclusions.\nFor many positive ontological arguments, there are parodies which\npurport to establish the non-existence of god(s); and for many\npositive ontological arguments there are lots (usually a large\ninfinity!) of similar arguments which purport to establish the\nexistence of lots (usually a large infinity) of distinct god-like\nbeings. Here are some modest examples: \n\n(1) By definition, God is a non-existent being who has every (other)\nperfection. Hence God does not exist.\n\n(2) I conceive of a being than which no greater can be conceived\nexcept that it only ever creates n universes. If such a being\ndoes not exist, then we can conceive of a greater being\u2014namely,\none exactly like it which does exist. But I cannot conceive of a being\nwhich is greater in this way. Hence, a being than which no greater can\nbe conceived except that it only ever creates n universes\nexists.\n\n(3) It is possible that God does not exist. God is not a contingent\nbeing, i.e., either it is not possible that God exists, or it is\nnecessary that God exists. Hence it is not possible that God exists.\nHence God does not exist.\n\n(4) It is analytic, necessary, and a priori that the F G is\nF. Hence, the existent perfect being who creates exactly\nn universes is existent. Hence the perfect being who creates\nexactly n universes exists.\n\nThere are many kinds of parodies of Ontological Arguments. The aim is\nto construct arguments which non-theists can reasonably claim to have\nno more reason to accept than the original Ontological Arguments\nthemselves. Of course, theists may well be able to hold that the\noriginals are sound, and the parodies not\u2014but that is an\nentirely unrelated issue. (All theists\u2014and no\nnon-theists\u2014should grant that the following argument is sound,\ngiven that the connectives are to be interpreted classically:\n\u201cEither 2+2=5, or God exists. Not 2+2=5. Hence God\nexists.\u201d This argument contributes nothing positive to any case\nfor theism, just as the argument \u201cEither 2+2=5, or God does not\nexist. Not 2+2=5. Hence God does not exist.\u201d contributes nothing\npositive to the case for non-theism.)\n\nThere are many parodic discussions of Ontological Arguments in the\nliterature. See, for example, the parody provided by Raymond Smullyan\n(1984), in which the argument is attributed to \u201cthe unknown\nDutch theologian van Dollard\u201d. A relatively recent addition to\nthe genre is described in Grey 2000, though the date of its\nconstruction is uncertain. It is the work of Douglas Gasking, one-time\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne (with\nemendations by William Grey and Denis Robinson):\n\nThe creation of the world is the most marvellous achievement\nimaginable.\nThe merit of an achievement is the product of (a) its intrinsic\nquality, and (b) the ability of its creator.\nThe greater the disability or handicap of the creator, the more\nimpressive the achievement.\nThe most formidable handicap for a creator would be\nnon-existence.\nTherefore, if we suppose that the universe is the product of an\nexistent creator, we can conceive a greater being\u2014namely, one\nwho created everything while not existing.\nAn existing God, therefore, would not be a being than which a\ngreater cannot be conceived, because an even more formidable and\nincredible creator would be a God which did not exist.\n(Hence) God does not exist.\n\n\nThis parody\u2014at least in its current state\u2014is inferior to\nother parodies in the literature, including the early parodies of\nGaunilo and Caterus. To mention but one difficulty, while we\nmight suppose that it would be a greater achievement to\ncreate something if one did not exist than if one did exist, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow from this that a non-existent creator is greater\n(qua being) than an existent creator. Perhaps it might be\nreplied that this objection fails to take the first premise into\naccount: if the creation of the world really is \u201cthe most\nmarvellous achievement imaginable\u201d, then surely there is some\nplausibility to the claim that the creator must have been non-existent\n(since that would make the achievement more marvellous than it would\notherwise have been). But what reason is there to believe that the\ncreation of the world is \u201cthe most marvellous achievement\nimaginable\u201d, in the sense which is required for this argument?\nSurely it is quite easy to imagine even more marvellous\nachievements\u2014e.g., the creation of many worlds at least as good\nas this one! (Of course, one might also want to say that, in fact, one\ncannot conceive of a non-existent being\u2019s actually creating\nsomething: that is literally inconceivable. Etc.) \n\nChambers 2000 and Siegwart 2014 provide interesting recent discussions\nof Gaunilo\u2019s parody of the Proslogion II argument.\n",
