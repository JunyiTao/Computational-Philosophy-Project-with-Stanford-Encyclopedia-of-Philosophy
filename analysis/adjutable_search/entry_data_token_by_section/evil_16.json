The claim in\nquestion is an interesting one, and a thorough evaluation of it would\ninvolve consideration of some deep issues in epistemology.\nFortunately, it does not seem to make any real difference in the present\ncontext whether or not the claim is true.\n\nThe reason emerges if one considers the epistemology of perception.\nSome philosophers hold that some beliefs about physical objects are\nnon-inferentially justified, while others hold that this is never so,\nand that justified beliefs about physical states of affairs are\nalways justified via an inference to the best explanation that starts\nout from beliefs about one\u2019s experiences.  But direct realists as\nmuch as indirect realists admit that there can be cases where a\nperson would be justified in believing that a certain physical state\nof affairs obtained were it not for the fact that he has good\nevidence that he is hallucinating, or else subject to perceptual\nillusion.  Moreover, given evidence of the relevant sort, it makes no\ndifference whether direct realism is true, or indirect realism: the\nbelief in question is undermined to precisely the same extent in\neither case.\n\nThe situation is the same in the case of religious experience.  If,\nas was argued in the previous section, the primary evidence\nconcerning a person\u2019s character consists of what the person does or\nfails to do in various circumstances, and if, as a consequence,\nconclusions concerning the character of a deity based upon religious\nexperience can be undercut by the argument from evil, then nothing is\nchanged if one holds that the having of religious experiences, rather\nthan providing one with evidence for the existence of God, makes it\nthe case that one is non-inferentially justified in believing in the\nexistence of God. The non-inferential justification is merely a\nprima facie justification, and one that is undercut by\nevidence bearing upon a person\u2019s character that deals with what the\nperson does and does not do.\n",
