    "main_text": "Does Plato change his mind about politics?\n10. Does Plato change his mind about politics?\n\nThe same point\u2014that we must view the dialogues as the product of\na single mind, a single philosopher, though perhaps one who changes\nhis mind\u2014can be made in connection with the politics of\nPlato\u2019s works (see Bobonich 2002).\n\nIt is noteworthy, to begin with, that Plato is, among other things, a\npolitical philosopher. For he gives expression, in several of\nhis writings (particular Phaedo), to a yearning to escape\nfrom the tawdriness of ordinary human relations. (Similarly, he\nevinces a sense of the ugliness of the sensible world, whose beauty\npales in comparison with that of the forms.) Because of this, it would\nhave been all too easy for Plato to turn his back entirely on\npractical reality, and to confine his speculations to theoretical\nquestions. Some of his works\u2014Parmenides is a stellar\nexample\u2014do confine themselves to exploring questions that seem\nto have no bearing whatsoever on practical life. But it is remarkable\nhow few of his works fall into this category. Even the highly abstract\nquestions raised in Sophist about the nature of being and\nnot-being are, after all, embedded in a search for the definition of\nsophistry; and thus they call to mind the question whether Socrates\nshould be classified as a sophist\u2014whether, in other words,\nsophists are to be despised and avoided. In any case, despite the\ngreat sympathy Plato expresses for the desire to shed one\u2019s body\nand live in an incorporeal world, he devotes an enormous amount of\nenergy to the task of understanding the world we live in, appreciating\nits limited beauty, and improving it.\n\nHis tribute to the mixed beauty of the sensible world, in\nTimaeus, consists in his depiction of it as the outcome of\ndivine efforts to mold reality in the image of the forms, using simple\ngeometrical patterns and harmonious arithmetic relations as building\nblocks. The desire to transform human relations is given expression in\na far larger number of works. Socrates presents himself, in\nPlato\u2019s Apology, as a man who does not have his head in\nthe clouds (that is part of Aristophanes\u2019 charge against him in\nClouds). He does not want to escape from the everyday world\nbut to make it better (see Allen 2010). He presents himself, in\nGorgias, as the only Athenian who has tried his hand at the\ntrue art of politics.\n\nSimilarly, the Socrates of Republic devotes a considerable\npart of his discussion to the critique of ordinary social\ninstitutions\u2014the family, private property, and rule by the many.\nThe motivation that lies behind the writing of this dialogue is the\ndesire to transform (or, at any rate, to improve) political life, not\nto escape from it (although it is acknowledged that the desire to\nescape is an honorable one: the best sort of rulers greatly prefer the\ncontemplation of divine reality to the governance of the city). And if\nwe have any further doubts that Plato does take an interest in the\npractical realm, we need only turn to Laws. A work of such\ngreat detail and length about voting procedures, punishments,\neducation, legislation, and the oversight of public officials can only\nhave been produced by someone who wants to contribute something to the\nimprovement of the lives we lead in this sensible and imperfect realm.\nFurther evidence of Plato\u2019s interest in practical matters can be\ndrawn from his letters, if they are genuine. In most of them, he\npresents himself as having a deep interest in educating (with the help\nof his friend, Dion) the ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius II, and thus\nreforming that city\u2019s politics.\n\nJust as any attempt to understand Plato\u2019s views about forms must\nconfront the question whether his thoughts about them developed or\naltered over time, so too our reading of him as a political\nphilosopher must be shaped by a willingness to consider the\npossibility that he changed his mind. For example, on any plausible\nreading of Republic, Plato evinces a deep antipathy to rule\nby the many. Socrates tells his interlocutors that the only politics\nthat should engage them are those of the anti-democratic regime he\ndepicts as the paradigm of a good constitution. And yet in\nLaws, the Athenian visitor proposes a detailed legislative\nframework for a city in which non-philosophers (people who have never\nheard of the forms, and have not been trained to understand them) are\ngiven considerable powers as rulers. Plato would not have invested so\nmuch time in the creation of this comprehensive and lengthy work, had\nhe not believed that the creation of a political community ruled by\nthose who are philosophically unenlightened is a project that deserves\nthe support of his readers. Has Plato changed his mind, then? Has he\nre-evaluated the highly negative opinion he once held of those who are\ninnocent of philosophy? Did he at first think that the reform of\nexisting Greek cities, with all of their imperfections, is a waste of\ntime\u2014but then decide that it is an endeavor of great value? (And\nif so, what led him to change his mind?) Answers to these questions\ncan be justified only by careful attention to what he has his\ninterlocutors say. But it would be utterly implausible to suppose that\nthese developmental questions need not be raised, on the grounds that\nRepublic and Laws each has its own cast of\ncharacters, and that the two works therefore cannot come into\ncontradiction with each other. According to this hypothesis (one that\nmust be rejected), because it is Socrates (not Plato) who is critical\nof democracy in Republic, and because it is the Athenian\nvisitor (not Plato) who recognizes the merits of rule by the many in\nLaws, there is no possibility that the two dialogues are in\ntension with each other. Against this hypothesis, we should say: Since\nboth Republic and Laws are works in which Plato is\ntrying to move his readers towards certain conclusions, by having them\nreflect on certain arguments\u2014these dialogues are not barred from\nhaving this feature by their use of interlocutors\u2014it would be an\nevasion of our responsibility as readers and students of Plato not to\nask whether what one of them advocates is compatible with what the\nother advocates. If we answer that question negatively, we have some\nexplaining to do: what led to this change? Alternatively, if we\nconclude that the two works are compatible, we must say why the\nappearance of conflict is illusory.\n",
