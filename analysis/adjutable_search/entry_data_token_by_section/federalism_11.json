    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Division of Power\n4.4 Division of Power\n\nAnother and related central philosophical topic is the critical\nassessment of alleged grounds for federal arrangements in general, and\nthe division of power between member units and central bodies in\nparticular, indicated in the preceding sections. Recent contributions\ninclude Knop et al. 1995, Kymlicka 2001, Kymlicka and Norman\n2000, Nicolaidis and Howse 2001, Norman 2006. Among the important\nissues, especially due to the risks of instability, are:\n\n\n\nHow the powers should be allocated, given that they should be\nused\u2014but may be abused\u2014by political entrepreneurs at\nseveral levels to affect their claims. The concerns about stability\nrequire careful attention to the impact of these powers on the ability\nto create and maintain \u2018dual loyalties\u2019 among the\ncitizenry. \n\n\nHow to ensure that neither member units nor the central authorities\noverstep their jurisdiction. As Mill noted, \u201cthe power to decide\nbetween them in any case of dispute should not reside in either of the\ngovernments, or in any functionary subject to it, but in an umpire\nindependent of both.\u201d (1861) Such a court must be sufficiently\nindependent, yet not utterly unaccountable. Many scholars seem to\ndetect a centralising tendency among such courts (Watts 1998).\n\n\n\nHow to maintain sufficient democratic control over central bodies when\nthese are composed by representatives of the executive branch of\nmember units? The chains of accountability may be too long for\nadequate responsiveness. This is part of the core concerns about a\n\u2018democratic deficit\u2019 in the European Union (Watts 1998,\nF\u00f8llesdal and Hix 2006). \n\n\nWho shall have the authority to revise the constitutionally embedded\ndivision of power? Some hold that a significant shift in national\nsovereignty occurs when such changes may occur without the unanimity\ncharacteristic of treaties. \n\n\nThe \u201cPrinciple of Subsidiarity\u201d has often been used to\nguide the decisions about allocation of power. This principle has\nrecently received attention owing to its inclusion in European Union\ntreaties. It holds that authority should rest with the member units\nunless allocating them to a central unit would ensure higher\ncomparative efficiency or effectiveness in achieving certain goals.\nThis principle can be specified in several ways, for instance\nconcerning which units are included, which goals are to be achieved,\nand who has the authority to apply it. The principle has multiple\npedigrees, and came to recent political prominence largely through its\nrole in quelling fears of centralization in Europe\u2014a contested\nrole which the principle has not quite filled (Fleiner and Schmitt\n1996, Burgess and Gagnon 1993, F\u00f8llesdal 1998).\n",
