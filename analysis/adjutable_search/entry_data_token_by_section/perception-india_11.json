    "main_text": "Nirvikalpaka and Savikalpaka Pratyak\u1e63a || The \u015a\u0101bdika (Grammarian) nominalism and realist objections\n3.4 The \u015a\u0101bdika (Grammarian) nominalism and realist objections\n\nBhart\u1e5bhari, the most notable Grammarian, highlights the intimate\nrelation between language, thought, and knowledge. Two aspects of his\ntheory have important implications for the nature of perceptual\nexperience. First, there is no non-linguistic cognition in the world;\nall knowledge appears permeated by words. Though\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s theory may leave room for extraordinary, or\nother-worldly, cognitions, there is no scope for pure\nnon-conceptualized perception in this world. The essence of his theory\nis: words do not designate objects in the external world directly, but\nthrough the intervention of universals, which are inherent in words.\nThus universals constitute the basis of our knowledge of the external\nworld, since they are intimately connected with language and mind on\nthe one hand, and the world on the other. Given this, the Grammarians\nquestion the very possibility of non-conceptual perception? The second\naspect is underscored by Kum\u0101rila who ascribes the so-called\nSuperimposition Theory to Bhart\u1e5bhari (Taber, 2005, 27),\naccording to which, a word has its \u201cown form\u201d superimposed\nupon its meaning. This has implications for determinate conceptual\nperception, which (for the pluralists and direct realists of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ny\u0101ya persuasions) arises purely\nout of the object itself and involves discrimination and determination\nof its nature.\n\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s argument can be thought of as an attack, on\nthe adjective \u2018non-verbal\u2019 (avyapade\u015byam) in\nthe Ny\u0101ya definition of perception, aimed at their belief that\nfor cognitive comprehension language is an inessential detail. For\nhim, bare sense-impressions cannot count as awarenesses because they\nare nor effective enough, nothing is accomplished by them and, they do\nnot result in appreciable mental activity. Bhart\u1e5bhari gives an\nexample: a man walking along a village path to approach his house\nwould invariably touch some grass on the road, and in some sense this\nwould be tactile awareness at a pre-linguistic level\n(V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, Ch.1, verse 123). But this would not\ncount as an awareness unless combined with the further ability to sort\nit out or verbalize it; consciousness cannot reveal an object to us\nunless we discriminate it, and the process of discrimination requires\nverbalization. What about a baby\u2019s awareness, or that of a mute\nperson, asks V\u0101tsy\u0101yana? Bhart\u1e5bhari points out that a\nbaby\u2019s sensations or a mute person\u2019s awarenesses may still\ncount as cognitive because they are linguistically potent. A\npre-linguistic state of an infant can be cognitive if and only if it\nhas speech potency, which is the cause of verbal language. So also, in\nthe non-conceptual perceptual awareness (in adults and even some\nanimals) speech-potency is latent; it is an essential trait of human\nconsciousness and the defining characteristic of cognitive awareness\n(V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, Ch.1, verse 126). All knowledge of\nwhat is to be done in this world depends on speech-potential; even an\ninfant has such knowledge due to residual traces from previous births\n(V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, Ch.1, verse 121). The initial sensory\nawareness of external objects which does not grasp any special\nfeatures of them, nonetheless illuminates them in a non-specific\nmanner as mere things by such expressions as \u2018this\u2019 or\n\u2018that\u2019 (Bhart\u1e5bhari; 123 and 124). Thus, insofar as\nthe initial sensation is an awareness, it can be verbalized. The\nfollowing analogy is offered as an argument for positing the presence\nof speech-seed (verbal disposition, as some modern philosophers call\nit) in pre-linguistic awareness: think about the experience of trying,\nbut failing, to remember a verse heard before. Bhart\u1e5bhari claims\nthat the entire verse exists in the cognitive faculty as\nspeech-potency but because of lack of other contributory factors there\nis no verbalization. Similarly, a non-linguistic experience of a\nmute-person is an awareness because of the presence of verbal\ndisposition or speech-seed even though there is no actualization of\nspeech. There are no non-conceptual perceptions, because ordinary\nobjects are not given to us without a concept (vikalpa) or\nsome mode of presentation; verbalization makes the concept explicit.\nThere are infinite concepts associated with an object, none integral\nto it. However, we always perceive an object in a concept as\nan instantiation of a universal; it is a cow, white, bovine,\nfour-legged, etc. The point to note is that concepts or universals\n(vikalpa-s) are word-generated and superimposed on the\nobjects; there are no \u2018thing-universals\u2019 or real\nuniversals over and above these. Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s defends\nlinguistic nominalism, according to which, words are the only\nuniversals that exist; thing-universals are word-generated illusions.\nAs Matilal remarks, for Bhart\u1e5bhari there is not much of a\ndistinction between words and concepts, they are two sides of the same\ncoin (Matilal, 1986, 396).\n\nNaiy\u0101yikas and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, the common sense\nrealists, raise specific objections to the Grammarian view on the\ngrounds that it is not borne by experience. We have separate\nawarenesses of words and universals. While we may not perceive\nsomething as a cow prior to acquiring the word \u2018cow,\u2019 we\nare surely aware of cowness before we acquire the linguistic\nexpression, just as we are aware of and can discriminate shades of red\neven before we acquire the names of some of those shades. A\nnon-conceptual awareness of the object is implied by the subsequent\noccurrence of a conceptual awareness with determinate content.\nKum\u0101rila also points to other phenomena which indicate that the\nawareness of the meaning of a word (the object) is independent and\ndistinct from the word itself. Furthermore, awareness of the meaning\nand that of the word are usually different kinds of representations;\nthere is no possibility of confusing or conflating these.\nKum\u0101rila brings to attention linguistic phenomena that reinforce\nthe point that words and meanings must be distinct representations,\ne.g., homonymy, synonymy, categorizing and recognizing grammatical\nparts of speech, etc. The ability to distinguish and discriminate\ntypes is perhaps enhanced by knowledge of language and concepts, but\nis not completely dependent on it. Those who are not trained in music\ncan certainly hear the difference between distinct notes, even though\nthey are unable to identify them by name. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana also\nappeals to the ordinary experience of people who are conversant with\nwords. Ordinarily, words are apprehended as names of objects. The\nknowledge of the word-object association comes after the perceptual\nknowledge derived through sense-object contact. Such contact results\nin a perceptual awareness which, in turn, provides the occasion for\nrecalling the appropriate word, if indeed the appropriate word exists\nin the experiencer\u2019s linguistic repertoire. Perceptual knowledge\nis antecedent to verbal knowledge and cannot owe its existence to\nwords. V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra specifically objects to\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s claim that infants and adults who lack a\nlanguage perceive objects by memory impressions of their names from\nprevious births. Objects are vividly and clearly given to us in\nperception, but the memory-impressions of previous births are at best\nvague and indistinct. V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra asks, \u201cHow can\nsuch a vague and unclear thing be identified with a clear and distinct\nperception?\u201d\n(Ny\u0101yav\u0101rttikat\u0101tparya\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101,\n127). His other argument against Bhart\u1e5bhari is the obvious point\nthat words do not necessarily refer to their objects, for example\nwords in quotation marks do not refer to objects, only to themselves.\nMoreover, if the word and its denotation were identical, a blind man\nwould grasp red or redness when he grasps the word \u2018red\u2019\nand a deaf person would grasp the word \u2018red\u2019 when he\ngrasps a red thing\n(Ny\u0101yav\u0101rttikat\u0101tparya\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101,\n129).\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas also have a general response to\nnominalists\u2014Buddhists as well as Grammarians. They posit monadic\nuniversals that correspond to natural and metaphysical kinds and one\ndyadic universal, viz. inherence. The main nominalist objection is\nthat once we accept real universals in our ontology we risk\noverpopulating the world with entities corresponding to every\nexpression that designates a property. For example, if we accept\nhorsehood and cowhood as universals, we also need to accept\nuniversalhood as another universal. The Naiy\u0101yikas propose that\nnot every expression which designates a property generates an\nobjective universal (j\u0101ti); some property-expressions\ncorrespond to subjectively constructed categories\n(up\u0101dhi), which though useful for analysis, are not\nontologically real. Uddyotakara argues that to correspond to a real\nuniversal a general term must meet two conditions: (i) a general term\nshould be based on a ground, which accounts for the common awareness\nof a number of different objects, that makes the application of the\nterm possible, and (ii) that ground should be a simple (non-compound),\nunitary property or entity that cannot be analyzed or explained away\notherwise (Commentary on Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, 2.2.65).\nUniversalhood is a bogus universal; it violates the second\ncondition. There is no simple basis or ground for universalhood as\nopposed to universals such as cowhood and horsehood; the ground of\nbeing one-in-many can be analyzed in terms of inherence. The same\napplies to universals like \u2018barefooted\u2019,\n\u2018cook\u2019, \u2018reader\u2019 etc.; the basis for their\napplication is presence of compound features such as bare feet, etc.\nHowever, this stratagem forces the Naiy\u0101yikas to admit that many\ngeneral terms designate bogus universals and, consequently, they start\nsuccumbing to the nominalist pressure. Matilal (1986, 420\u2013421)\nnotes that there is another way in which it happens to\nNavya-Ny\u0101ya: A real universal must partake of the nature\nof \u2018one-in-many\u2019. The Navya-Naiy\u0101yika, Udayana (c.\n10th century CE), lists a third necessary condition for disqualifying\na property from being regarded as a real universal. Under this\ncondition, an abstract property that belongs only to one individual is\nalso a bogus universal even though it is simple and unanalyzable;\nskyness in the sky is bogus because it is only a nominal attribute.\nHowever, since both cowhood and skyness are simple properties, they\nare grasped as such in perception without further\nqualification. In this sense, Naiy\u0101yikas maintain that some real\nuniversals are directly perceptible. When we see a cow, we do not\nnecessarily see \u2018it\u2019 as a \u2018cow\u2019, the cow and\nthe cowness are not given as separate entities in our awareness,\nrather they appear fused. This leads to the peculiar Ny\u0101ya view\nthat real universals and basic properties are grasped in our awareness\nas \u2018epistemic firsts\u2019 or ultimates (Matilal, 1986, 421).\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba calls such perception, in which universals are\ngrasped as such, non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka)\nperception.\n",
