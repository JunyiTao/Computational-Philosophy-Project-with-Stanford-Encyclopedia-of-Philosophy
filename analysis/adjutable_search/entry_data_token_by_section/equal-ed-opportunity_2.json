    "main_text": "Equality of Educational Opportunity as an Independent Concern || The State Regulation of Education\n1.3 The State Regulation of Education\n\nA third consideration that underscores the importance of thinking\nabout the distribution of educational opportunities is that in most\ndeveloped societies, the vast majority of such opportunities are\nprovided through and regulated by the state. All developed societies\nhave a legal requirement that children attend school for a certain\nnumber of years. This means that, unlike other policy levers,\neducation is typically under the control of state institutions and has\nthe potential to reach the vast majority of the nation\u2019s\nchildren across racial, religious, class, and gender-based divides.\nAnd given the myriad benefits that flow from education, it is arguably\na state\u2019s most powerful mechanism for influencing the lives of\nits members. This makes education perhaps the most important function\nof government.\n\nSince education is an integral function of government, and because it\nis an opportunity that government largely provides, there are special\nconstraints on its distribution. Justice, if it requires nothing else,\nrequires that governments treat their citizens with equal concern and\nrespect. The state, for example, cannot justly provide unequal\nbenefits to children on the basis of factors such as their race or\ngender. Indeed, such discrimination, even when it arises from indirect\nstate measures such as the funding of schools from property taxes, can\nbe especially pernicious to and is not lost on children. When poor and\nminority children see, for example, that their more advantaged peers\nattend better resourced public schools\u2014a conclusion that can be\ndrawn in many cases simply by comparing how school facilities\nlook\u2014they may internalize the view that the state cares less\nabout cultivating their interests and skills. Children in this\nposition suffer the dignitary injury of feeling that they are not\nequal to their peers in the state\u2019s eyes (Kozol 1991, 2005).\nThis harm is especially damaging to one\u2019s self-respect because\nit is the development of one\u2019s talents that is at stake; whether\nor not one has opportunities to gain the skills and confidence to\npursue their conception of the good is central to what Rawls calls\n\u201cthe social basis of self-respect\u201d (Rawls 1999: sections\n65 and 67; Satz 2007: 639).\n",
