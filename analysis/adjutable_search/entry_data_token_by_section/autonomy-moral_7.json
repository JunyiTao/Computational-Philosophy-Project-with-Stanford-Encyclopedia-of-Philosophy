    "main_text": "Autonomy in Social and Political Philosophy || Identity and Conceptions of the Self\n3.2 Identity and Conceptions of the Self\n\nAutonomy, as we have been describing it, certainly attaches\nparadigmatically to individual persons; it is not (in this usage) a\nproperty of groups or peoples. So the autonomy that grounds basic\nrights and which connects to moral responsibility, as this concept is\nthought to do, is assigned to persons without essential reference to\nother people, institutions, or traditions within which they may live\nand act. Critics claim, however, that such a view runs counter to the\nmanner in which most of us (or all of us in some ways) define\nourselves, and hence diverges problematically from the aspects of\nidentity that motivate action, ground moral commitments, and by which\npeople formulate life plans. Autonomy, it is argued, implies the\nability to reflect wholly on oneself, to accept or reject one\u2019s\nvalues, connections, and self-defining features, and change such\nelements of one\u2019s life at will. But we are all not only deeply\nenmeshed in social relations and cultural patterns, we are also\ndefined by such relations, some claim(Sandel 1982, 15\u201365). For\nexample, we use language to engage in reflection but language is\nitself a social product and deeply tied to various cultural forms. In\nany number of ways we are constituted by factors that lie beyond our\nreflective control but which nonetheless structure our values,\nthoughts, and motivations (Taylor 1991, 33f; for discussion see Bell\n1993, 24\u201354). To say that we are autonomous (and hence morally\nresponsible, bear moral rights, etc.) only when we can step back from\nall such connections and critically appraise and possibly alter them\nflies in the face of these psychological and metaphysical\n realities.[6]\n\nIn a different manner, critics have claimed that the liberal\nconception of the person, reflected in standard models of autonomy,\nunder-emphasizes the deep identity-constituting connections we have\nwith gender, race, culture, and religion, among other things. Such\n\u201cthick\u201d identities are not central to the understanding of\nthe self-governing person who, according to standard liberal models,\nis fully able to abstract from such elements of her self-concept and\nto either identify with or to reject such them. But such an ideal too\nnarrowly valorizes the life of the cosmopolitan \u201cman\u201d\n\u2014 the world traveler who freely chooses whether to settle into\nthis or that community, identify with this or that group, and so on\n(see Young 1991, Alcoff 2006 and Appiah 2010; for discussion, see\nMeyers, 2000b). \n\nThese challenges have also focused on the relation of the self to its\nculture (Margalit and Raz, 1990, Tamir 1993). What is at issue from a\npolicy perspective is that emphasis on the individual\u2019s\nself-government, with the cosmopolitan perspective that this entails,\nmakes it difficult if not impossible to ground rights to the\nprotection and internal self- government of traditional cultures\nthemselves (Kymlicka, 1995). This is problematic in that it excludes\nfrom the direct protection of liberal policies those individuals and\ngroups whose self-conceptions and value commitments are deeply\nconstituted by cultural factors. Or, conversely, the assumption that\nthe autonomous person is able to separate himself from all cultural\ncommitments forestalls moves to provide state protection for cultural\nforms themselves, insofar as such state policies rest on the value of\nautonomy. \n\nThere have been many responses to these charges on behalf of a liberal\noutlook (e.g., Kymlicka, 1989, Gutman, 1985, Appiah 2005; for a\ngeneral response to question of cultural identities see Kymlicka\n1997). The most powerful response is that autonomy need not require\nthat people be in a position to step away from all of their\nconnections and values and to critically appraise them. Mere piecemeal\nreflection is all that is required. As Kymlicka puts it: \u201cNo\nparticular task is set for us by society, and no particular cultural\npractice has authority that is beyond individual judgement and\npossible rejection\u201d (Kymlicka, 1989:, 50). \n\nThere is a clarification that is needed in this exchange, however. For\ninsofar as defenders of liberal principles (based on the value of\nautonomy) claim that all aspects of a person\u2019s self-concept be\nsubject to alteration in order to manifest autonomy, they needlessly\nexaggerate the commitments of the liberal position. For such a view is\nopen to the charge that liberal conceptions fail to take seriously the\npermanent and unalterable aspects of the self and its social position\n(Young, 1990, 46). Our embodiment, for example, is often not something\nwhich we can alter other than marginally, and numerous other\nself-defining factors such as sexual orientation (for some), native\nlanguage, culture and race, are not readily subject to our\nmanipulation and transformation, even in a piecemeal manner. To say\nthat we are heteronomous because of this is therefore deeply\nproblematic. What must be claimed by the defender of autonomy-based\nliberalism is that the ability in question is to change those aspects\nof oneself from which one is deeply alienated (or with which one does\nnot identify, etc.). For in those cases where, upon reflection, one\nexperiences one\u2019s body, culture, race, or sexuality as an\nexternal burden constricting one\u2019s more settled and authentic\nnature, and still one cannot alter that factor, then one lacks\nautonomy relative to it (see Christman,2009 ch. 6). But if one feels\nfully at home within those unalterable parameters one does not lack\nautonomy because of that unalterability (for a different way of\napproach this issue see Mahmoud 2005 and Khader 2011). \n",
