    "main_text": "\n\nJeremy Bentham, jurist and political reformer, is the philosopher\nwhose name is most closely associated with the foundational era of the\nmodern utilitarian tradition. Earlier moralists had enunciated several\nof the core ideas and characteristic terminology of utilitarian\nphilosophy, most notably John Gay, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume,\nClaude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius and Cesare Beccaria, but it was Bentham\nwho rendered the theory in its recognisably secular and systematic\nform and made it a critical tool of moral and legal philosophy and\npolitical and social improvement. In 1776, he first announced himself\nto the world as a proponent of utility as the guiding principle of\nconduct and law in A Fragment on Government. In An\nIntroduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (printed\n1780, published 1789), as a preliminary to developing a theory of\npenal law he detailed the basic elements of classical utilitarian\ntheory. The penal code was to be the first in a collection of codes\nthat would constitute the utilitarian pannomion, a complete\nbody of law based on the utility principle, the development of which\nwas to engage Bentham in a lifetime\u2019s work and was to include\ncivil, procedural, and constitutional law. As a by-product, and in the\ninterstices between the sub-codes of this vast legislative edifice,\nBentham\u2019s writings ranged across ethics, ontology, logic,\npolitical economy, judicial administration, poor law reform, prison\nreform, punishment, policing, international law, education, religious\nbeliefs and institutions, democratic theory, government, and\nadministration. In all these areas he made major contributions that\ncontinue to feature in discussions of utilitarianism, notably its\nmoral, legal, economic and political forms. Upon this rests\nBentham\u2019s reputation as one of the great thinkers in modern\nphilosophy.\n",
