    "main_text": "The Role of Introspection in Scientific Psychology || The Rise of Introspective Psychology as a Science\n3.1 The Rise of Introspective Psychology as a Science\n\nPhilosophers have long made introspective claims about the human\nmind\u2014or, to speak more cautiously, they\u2019ve made claims\nseemingly at least in part introspectively grounded. Aristotle (3rd c.\nBCE/1961) asserts that thought does not occur without imagery. Mengzi\n(3rd c. BCE/2008) argues that our hearts are pleased by moral goodness\nand revolted by evil, even if the pleasure and revulsion are not\nevident in our outward behavior. Berkeley finds in himself no\n\u201cabstract ideas\u201d like that of a triangle that is, in\nLocke\u2019s terms \u201cneither oblique, nor rectangle, neither\nequilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at\nonce\u201d (Berkeley 1710/1965, 12; Locke 1689/1975, 596). James Mill\n(1829 [1878]) attempts a catalog of the varieties of sense\nexperience.\n\nAlthough a number of early modern philosophers had aimed to initiate\nthe scientific study of the mind, it wasn\u2019t until the middle of\nthe 19th century\u2014with the appearance of quantitative\nintrospective methods, especially regarding sensory\nconsciousness\u2014that the study of the mind took shape as a\nprogressive, mathematical, laboratory-based science. Early\nquantitative psychologists such as Helmholtz (1856/1962), Fechner\n(1860 [1964]), and Wundt (1896 [1902]) sought quantitative answers to\nquestions like: By how much must two physical stimuli differ for the\nexperiences of them to differ noticeably? How weak a stimulus can\nstill be consciously perceived? What is the mathematical relationship\nbetween stimulus intensity and the intensity of the resulting\nsensation? (The Weber-Fechner law holds that the relationship is\nlogarithmic.) Along what dimensions, exactly, can sense experience\nvary? (The \u201ccolor solid\u201d [see the link to the Munsell\nsolid in Other Internet Resources, below], for example, characterizes\ncolor experience by appeal to just three dimensions of variation: hue,\nsaturation, and lightness or brightness.) Although from very early on,\npsychologists also employed non-introspective methods (e.g.,\nperformance on memory tests, reaction times), most early\ncharacterizations of the field stood introspection at the center.\nJames, for example, wrote that \u201cintrospective observation is\nwhat we have to rely on first and foremost and always\u201d (1890\n[1981, 185]).\n\nIn contrast with the dominant philosophical tradition that has, since\nDescartes, stressed the special privilege or at least high accuracy of\nintrospective judgments about consciousness (see Section 4.1 below)\nmany early introspective psychologists held that the introspection of\ncurrently ongoing or recently past conscious experience is difficult\nand prone to error if the introspective observer is insufficiently\ntrained. Wundt, for example, reportedly did not credit the\nintrospective reports of people with fewer than 50,000 trials of\npractice in observing their conscious experience (Boring 1953).\nTitchener, a leading American introspective psychologist, wrote a\n1600-page introspective training manual for students, arguing that\nintrospective observation is at least as difficult as observation in\nthe physical sciences (Titchener 1901\u20131905; see also Wundt 1874\n[1908]; M\u00fcller 1904; for contemporary discussions of\nintrospective training see Varela 1996; Nahmias 2002; Schwitzgebel\n2011b). This difference in optimism about untrained introspection may\npartly reflect differences in the types of judgments foregrounded in\nthe two disciplines. Philosophers stressing privilege tend to focus on\ncoarse and (seemingly) simple judgments such as \u201cI\u2019m\nhaving a visual experience of redness\u201d or \u201cI believe\nit\u2019s raining\u201d. The projects of interest to introspective\npsychologists often required much finer judgments\u2014such as\ndetermining with mathematical precision whether one visual sensation\nhas twice the \u201cintensity\u201d of another or determining along\nwhat dimensions emotional experience can vary.\n",
