    "main_text": "The Macro-Objectification Problem\n3. The Macro-Objectification Problem\n\nWe shall now clarify why the formalism we have just presented gives\nrise to the measurement problem. To this purpose we shall, first of\nall, discuss the standard oversimplified argument based on the\nso-called von Neumann ideal measurement scheme. \n\nLet us begin by recalling how measurements are described in the\nstandard formalism:\n\nSuppose that a microsystem \\(S\\), immediately before the measurement\nof one of its observables, say \\(B\\), is in the eigenstate\n\\(\\ket{b_j}\\) of the corresponding operator. The apparatus (a\nmacrosystem) used to gain information about \\(B\\) is initially assumed\nto be in a precise macroscopic state, its ready state, corresponding\nto a definite macro property\u2014e.g., its pointer points at 0 on a\nscale. Since the apparatus \\(A\\) is made of elementary particles,\natoms and so on, it should be possible to describe it within quantum\nmechanics, which will associate a well defined state vector\n\\(\\ket{A_0}\\) to it (at least in principle). One then assumes that\nthere is an appropriate system-apparatus interaction lasting for a\nfinite time, such that when the initial state of the apparatus is\ntriggered by the state \\(\\ket{b_j}\\), it ends up in a final\nconfiguration \\(\\ket{A_j}\\), which is macroscopically distinguishable\nfrom the initial one and from the other configurations \\(\\ket{A_k}\\)\nin which it would end up if triggered by a different eigenstate\n\\(\\ket{b_k}\\). Moreover, for simplicity one assumes that the system is\nleft by the measurement in its initial state. In brief, one assumes\nthat one can dispose things in such a way that the system-apparatus\ninteraction can be described as: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1}\n(\\textit{initial state}){:}\\ & \\ket{b_k} \\ket{A_0} \\\\\n(\\textit{final state}){:}\\ & \\ket{b_k} \\ket{A_k} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nEquation (1) and the hypothesis that the superposition principle\ngoverns all natural processes tell us that, if the initial state of\nthe microsystem is a linear superposition of different eigenstates\n(for simplicity we will consider only two of them), one has:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{2}\n(\\textit{initial state}){:}\\ & (a\\ket{b_k} + b\\ket{b_j})\\ket{A_0 } \\\\\n(\\textit{final state}){:}\\ & (a\\ket{b_k} \\ket{A_k} + b\\ket{b_j} \\ket{A_j}).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSome remarks about this are in order:\n\nClearly, the above scheme is highly idealized, both because it\ntakes for granted that one can prepare the apparatus in a precise\nstate, which is impossible since we cannot have control over all its\ndegrees of freedom, and because it assumes that the apparatus\nregisters the outcome without altering the state of the measured\nsystem. However, as we shall discuss below, these assumptions are by\nno means essential to derive the embarrassing conclusion we have to\nface, i.e., that the final state is a linear superposition of two\nstates corresponding to two macroscopically different states of the\napparatus. Since we know that the + representing linear superpositions\ncannot be replaced by the logical alternative either \u2026\nor, the measurement problem arises: what meaning can one attach\nto a state of affairs in which two macroscopically and perceptively\ndifferent states occur simultaneously?\nAs already mentioned, the standard solution to this problem is\ngiven by the WPR postulate: in a measurement process reduction occurs:\nthe final state is not the one appearing in the second line of\nequation (2) but, since macro-objectification takes place, it is\n\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tag{3}\n\\text{either } &\\ket{b_k} \\ket{A_k} \\text{ with probability }\n\\lvert a\\rvert^2 \\\\ \\text{or } &\\ket{b_j} \\ket{A_j} \\text{ with\nprobability } \\lvert b\\rvert^2.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nNowadays, there is a general consensus that this solution is\nabsolutely unacceptable. It corresponds to assuming that the linear\nnature of the theory is broken at some point, without clearly\nspecifying when. Thus, quantum theory is unable to explain how it can\nhappen that apparatuses behave as required by the WPR postulate (which\nis one of the axioms of the theory), instead of satisfying the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. Even if one were to accept that quantum\nmechanics has a limited field of applicability, so that it does not\naccount for all natural processes and, in particular, it breaks down\nat the macrolevel, it is clear that the theory does not contain any\nprecise criterion for identifying the borderline between micro and\nmacro, linear and nonlinear, deterministic and stochastic, reversible\nand irreversible. To use the words of J.S. Bell, there is nothing in\nthe theory fixing such a borderline and the split between the\ntwo above types of processes is fundamentally shifty. \n\nIf one looks at the historical debate on this problem, one can easily\nsee that it is precisely by continuously resorting to this ambiguity\nabout the split that adherents of the Copenhagen orthodoxy or easy\nsolvers (Bell 1990) of the measurement problem have rejected the\ncriticism of the heretics (Gottfried 2000). For instance,\nBohr succeeded in rejecting Einstein\u2019s criticisms at the Solvay\nConferences by stressing that some macroscopic parts of the apparatus\nhad to be treated fully quantum mechanically; von Neumann and Wigner\ndisplaced the split by locating it between the physical processes and\nthe consciousness (but what is a conscious being, from the physical\npoint of view?), and so on.\n\nIt is not our task to review here the various attempts to solve the\nabove difficulties. One can find many exhaustive treatments of this\nproblem in the literature. We conclude this section by discussing how\nthe measurement problem is indeed a consequence of very general, in\nfact unavoidable, assumptions on the nature of measurements, and not\nspecifically of the assumptions of von (oversimplified) von\nNeumann\u2019s model. This was established in a series of theorems of\nincreasing generality, notably the ones by Fine (1970),\nd\u2019Espagnat (1971), Shimony (1974), Brown (1986) and Busch &\nShimony (1996). Possibly the most general and direct proof is given by\nBassi and Ghirardi (2000), whose results we briefly summarize. The\nassumptions of the theorem are:\n\nA microsystem can be prepared at least in two different\neigenstates of an observable (for example the spin component along the\nz-axis) and in a superposition of two such states;\nOne has a sufficiently reliable way of \u2018measuring\u2019\nsuch an observable, meaning that when the measurement is triggered by\neach of the two above eigenstates, the process leads in the vast\nmajority of cases to macroscopically and perceptually different\nsituations of the universe. This requirement allows for cases in which\nthe experimenter does not have perfect control of the apparatus, the\napparatus is entangled with the rest of the universe, the apparatus\nmakes mistakes, or the measured system is altered or even destroyed in\nthe measurement process;\nAll natural processes obey the linear laws of quantum theory.\n\n\nFrom these very general assumptions one can show that, repeating the\nmeasurement on systems prepared in the superposition of the two given\neigenstates, in the great majority of cases one ends up in a\nsuperposition of macroscopically and perceptually different situations\nof the whole universe. This, again, is the measurement problem of\nquantum mechanics, which calls for a resolution.\n",
