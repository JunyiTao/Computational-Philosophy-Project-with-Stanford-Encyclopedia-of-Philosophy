    "main_text": "Scholastic Concepts of Probability || Endoxic (or topical) probability\n3.1 Endoxic (or topical) probability\n\nThe most prominent scholastic understanding of probability derived\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s notion of endoxon, which shaped the\nconcept of \u201cprobable opinion\u201d (opinio\nprobabilis). Aristotle defines endoxon in\nTopics I, 100b20 as:\n\n\n[T]hose opinions are reputable [endoxa] which are accepted by\neveryone or by the majority or by the wise \u2013 i.e., by all, or by\nthe majority, or by the most notable and reputable of them.\n\n\nBoethius and medieval commentators on the Topics translated\nendoxa as probabilia (\u201cprobable things\u201d)\nor opiniones probabiles (\u201cprobable opinions\u201d). In\nlight of the rise of Aristotelianism, it is thus unsurprising that\nThomas Aquinas and other scholastics turned to this understanding of\nprobability when they discussed conclusions from uncertain\n premises:[13]\n\n\n[P]ropositions are called probable because they are more known to the\nwise or to the multitude. (Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the\nPosterior Analytics, I.8.35)\n\n\nMany scholastic characterizations or definitions of probability\ncontain an explicit reference to Topics I, such as this one\nby Gregory of Rimini:\n\n\nMoreover, since \u201cprobable things\u201d mean \u201cwhat appears\ntrue to the many or the wise\u201d according to the Philosopher\n[i.e., Aristotle] in Topics I, which also agrees with\nAugustine\u2019s Contra Cresconium, Book III, where he says\nthat things are called probable because \u201cthey are endorsed, that\nis, approved and believed\u201d, [to which] add \u201cto be\ntrue\u201d, it follows that approbation by the authority of the wise\nof this world is a reason which generates probability (ratio\n probabilis).[14]\n\n\nAs this quotation shows, Augustine\u2019s understanding of\nprobability was thought to coincide with Aristotle\u2019s, a fact\nthat must have buttressed the endoxic notion of probability. Yet,\nwhile Augustine is not often referred to in medieval definitions of\nprobability, a reference to Topics I became a\ncommonplace. It seems immediately clear why an endoxic understanding\nof probabilis led to the modern translations\n\u201creputable\u201d, \u201cplausible\u201d,\n\u201cbelievable\u201d, \u201capprovable\u201d, or\n\u201capproved\u201d. Reputability and approval, however, are not\nnecessarily indicators of truth, and therefore the role that\nendoxa played for Aristotle and for the scholastics needs\nclarification.\n\nEndoxa were important for ancient rhetoric and dialectic.\nRhetoric aims at persuasion, and opinions which are generally accepted\nor backed up by the intellectual reputation of their sources tend to\nbe persuasive. In rhetorical usage, therefore, endoxon and\nprobabilis can be equated to a proposition with\n\u201cexpected persuasiveness\u201d. Dialectic is concerned with\ndisputes and inquiry through the exchange of arguments.\nEndoxa, in ancient dialectic, were starting, intermediate,\nand often also endpoints of such activities; and, to this extent, they\nmight be seen as instruments for intellectual training. This, however,\nwould create the wrong impression of the overall role of\nendoxa in Aristotle\u2019s methodology of the sciences\n(Haskins 2004; Kraut 2006; Renon 1998). He also takes them to be\nreasonable starting points for scientific inquiry, as well as material\nfor testing its results. The process of inquiry should select the\nright endoxa and order them systematically. In this respect,\nthe connection between likely truth and being held true by many or\nwise people is presumed by Aristotle. There is no guarantee, however,\nthat an endoxon is true, which makes it an apt object of\ninquiry.\n\nScholastic usage of opinio probabilis conformed less to the\nrhetorical and more to the dialectical and methodological roles of\nendoxa (see also Section 4.1) \u2013 even if the opinions in\nquestion were applied in oratory and preaching. A scholastic author,\nin particular from the thirteenth century onward, who called a\nphilosophical position or a theological claim probable alluded to an\nepistemic quality which justified serious consideration over and above\na proposition\u2019s suitability for inducing agreement in hearers.\nSensory perception is sometimes mentioned as a basis for probable\nopinions which are held by all people (\u201cSnow is\n white\u201d).[15]Apparently,\n the opinions of the uneducated (rudes) and laymen\n(idiotae) did not qualify as probable, unless they were\nobservation statements, for which uneducated people had as much\ncompetence as the educated. Competence in judging a matter was\ntherefore the key to scholastic ascriptions of probability. The\ncategory of the \u201cwisest\u201d in medieval definitions of\nprobability was a stand-in for \u201cexpert\u201d, including\ntop-ranking lawyers, theologians, medical doctors and philosophers\n\u2013 or even architects, engineers and other virtuosi of\nmechanical arts (as in Boethius\u2019s definition of probable\nopinion). This expert status was acquired through training in a\nuniversity or with a master. Moreover, an expert counted as such only\nin his field of\n expertise.[16]\n The sapientes to which the definition of probable opinion\nrefers nevertheless had to possess at least some positive\nnon-epistemic traits: they had to be decent (probus) and\ntrustworthy people in order to possess weighty opinions.\n\nThe role of authority in the endoxic definition of probability has\nbeen widely discussed and\n criticized.[17]\n Although the word auctoritas does not occur regularly in\ndefinitions of \u201cthe probable\u201d, it seems indisputable that\nthese definitions refer to authority as the basis of probability. The\nauthority in question is, in principle, intellectual or epistemic\n(based on expertise); but the distinction between epistemic and\nhierarchical authority was always blurry, and the latter could (and\noften did) prevail in practice. Given the dismal training of parish\npriests, this was surely often the case because the uneducated were\ncalled on to accept the opinions of their parish priest or confessor\n(Thomas Aquinas, Quodlibetales, III, q. 4, 2, 47; and\nAntoninus, Summa, I, 3, 10, 64). Moreover, scholastic\nreliance on institutional indicators for competence may have impeded a\nclear distinction between epistemic and hierarchical authority, since\nepistemic authority was to some extent tied to hierarchical success in\nacademia. Students, for instance, were prima facie expected to believe\nthe opinions of their professors (i.e., masters).\n\nThe distinction between hierarchical and epistemic authority should\nnot be confused with the distinction between external and internal\nreasons for holding a proposition true. Endoxic probability seems to\nbe entirely based on the opinions of others and thus on external (or\nindirect) reasons for holding a proposition true. (Internal or direct\nreasons are those a person herself can assess.) Yet some difficulties\nwith the view that medieval probability was wholly external and thus\nauthority-based deserve to be addressed. Endoxic probability was not\nthe only concept of probability in medieval scholasticism, and others\nwere (as we shall see) more open to internal reasons. Moreover, an\nexpert might claim probability for his own judgment \u2013 something\nnot excluded by the definition of endoxon. Nevertheless,\nagents were often asked to conform to the opinion of a qualified\nmajority (\u201cthe larger and more reasonable part\u201d, maior\net sanior pars) of competent\n evaluators.[18]\n This requirement shows that the endoxic understanding of probable\nopinions was indeed skewed towards external\n authority.[19]\n",
