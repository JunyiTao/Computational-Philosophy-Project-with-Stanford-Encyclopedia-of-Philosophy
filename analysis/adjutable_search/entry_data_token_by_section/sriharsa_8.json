    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n3. Metaphysics\n\nA significant part of The Sweets of Refutation is devoted to\nthe question of whether various items in the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika ontology can be satisfactorily\ndefined. In the Aphorisms on the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika System\n(Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra), Ka\u1e47\u0101da\n(2nd century CE) offered an ontological scheme that\nincluded six positive categories\n(bh\u0101va-pad\u0101rtha-s), namely, substance\n(dravya), quality (gu\u1e47a), action\n(karma), universal (s\u0101m\u0101nya), ultimate\ndifferentiator (vi\u015be\u1e63a), and the relation of\ninherence (samav\u0101ya). In Of the Seven\nCategories (Saptapad\u0101rth\u012b), the later\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher \u015aiv\u0101dityami\u015bra\n(12th century CE) added the negative category of absence\n(abh\u0101va) to the list. This scheme of seven ontological\ncategories was adopted by Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers\nlike Udayana who combined this ontological scheme with the\nepistemological commitments of Ny\u0101ya. In the fourth chapter of\nThe Sweets of Refutation, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a sets\nhimself the task of dismantling this ontological scheme: he begins by\nattacking the notion of a positive category, and then attacks the\ndefinitions of substance, universal, ultimate differentiator,\nrelation, and absence.\n\nAlong the way, he focuses attention on two key items in the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika ontology: causation and\ndistinctness. Without these two items, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher cannot defend the claim\nthat there is a plurality of things in the world that are distinct\nfrom consciousness or the self. Once causation is out of the picture,\nthe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher cannot explain how our\nconscious awareness-episodes can be brought about by mind-independent\nobjects. Analogously, without distinctness, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher cannot claim that we have\nany reason to believe that there is a plurality of objects in the\nworld. This section shall outline \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s\ndiscussion of causation and distinctness.\n",
