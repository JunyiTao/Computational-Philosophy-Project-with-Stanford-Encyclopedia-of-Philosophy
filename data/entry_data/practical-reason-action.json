    "preamble": "\n\nA wave of recent philosophical work on practical rationality is\norganized by the following implicit argument: Practical reasoning is\nfiguring out what to do; to do is to act; so the forms of practical\ninference can be derived from the structure or features of action. Now\nit is not as though earlier work in analytic philosophy had failed to\nregister the connection between action and practical rationality; in\nfact, practical reasoning was usually picked out as, roughly,\nreasoning directed toward action. But for much of the twentieth\ncentury, attention moved quickly away from this initial delineation of\nthe subject area, to the interplay of beliefs and desires within the\nmind (instrumentalist theories, including their Davidsonian and\nWilliamsian variants), or to procedures for checking that a plan of\naction was supported by sufficient yet consistent reasons (Kantian\ntheories), or to the ultra-refined sensibilities of the practically\nintelligent reasoner (Aristotelian theories). The hallmark of the\nemerging family of treatments to be surveyed here is, first, the\nsustained attention paid to answering the question, \u201cWhat does\nit take to be an action (at all)?\u201d, and second, the use made of\na distinction between full-fledged action and its lesser relatives;\ncharacterizations and terminology vary, but often the less robust\nalternative is called \u201cmere activity\u201d or \u201cmere\nbehavior\u201d. Very schematically, these arguments for a theory of\npractical reasoning try to show that reasons brought to bear on choice\nmust have some particular logical form, if action is not to lapse into\nsomething less than that.\n\nThe current state of the dialectic is evidently transitional, because\nwork of this sort for the most part does not yet speak to other work\nof the same kind. (Recent exceptions are marked below, and it does\nspeak to earlier but differently focused work in the field.) Despite\ntheir shared agreement that practical reasoning is where the action\nis, and the consequent willingness to accord explanatory priority to\naction theory in developing theories of practical rationality, these\ntheorists differ among themselves as to what the most central features\nof actions are, and accordingly they disagree about what the\nlegitimate patterns of practical inference turn out to be. They also\ndiffer in their underlying philosophical motivations, as well as in\nwhat they take to be the upshots of their views for substantive moral\ntheory. For that reason, the considerations in play do not have the\nsort of mutual coherence and organization characteristic of the\ndiscussion of some of the more settled philosophical problem\nspaces.\n\nThe purpose of this overview is to provide a map of this territory,\nand because interchanges between the theorists in it are infrequent,\nthis is primarily going to mean describing the disparate research\nprograms that have adopted its framing argument. Because the priority\nis to highlight both their common ground, and the ways in which these\nprograms nonetheless talk past one another, this article will not\npress a number of problems internal to the several research programs.\nIf you notice some obvious but unaddressed objection to some line of\ninquiry, don\u2019t assume you\u2019re making a mistake, but don\u2019t let it\nsidetrack you.\n\nThe features of action that have come in for the most attention are,\nfirst, its calculative structure, second, its attributability, third,\nits aspiration to be challenging and ambitious, fourth, its role in\nsocial practice, and fifth, its evaluative features, and they will be\ndiscussed in that order. That will permit us to conclude with remarks\nabout the prospects and agenda of this approach to practical\ndeliberation.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Calculative View of Action\n\nThe most prominent advocates of the calculative view of action are\nCandace Vogler and Michael Thompson. We will start with Vogler\u2019s\nversion of the view, and proceed to Thompson\u2019s.\n\nCall psychologism the claim that the right way to do logic\nand theory of rationality more generally is first to figure out how\nthe mind works. Since the early seventies, almost all mainstream work\non practical reasoning has been psychologistic in this sense; a\nrepresentative example might be Michael Smith\u2019s argument for the\n\u2018Humean theory of motivation\u2019, which turns on what desires\n\u2013 a psychological state \u2013 are, and how they work (Smith\n1987). Vogler\u2019s treatment of practical rationality (Vogler 2002) is a\nsharp departure from the common approach, and an attempt to replicate\nin that field the anti-psychologistic turn which Frege and Husserl\nimparted to work on theoretical rationality in, respectively, the\nanalytic and Continental traditions. She takes herself to be following\nG. E. M. Anscombe (Anscombe 1985, Vogler 2001), who was in turn\nfollowing Aquinas. (We won\u2019t take up the historical background to the\nbody of work under discussion here, but see the entry on\n medieval theories of practical reason.)\n\nVogler notices that instrumentalism \u2013 the view that all reasons\nfor action are means-end reasons \u2013 is the default view in\ncontemporary philosophy. There must, she infers, be a compelling\ninsight at the bottom of it; but instrumentalism has been much-refuted\nover the past few decades. What the many refutations of\ninstrumentalism really show, Vogler believes, is that formulating the\nunderlying insight psychologistically (as a thesis about mental\noperations and the mental states involved in them) results in weak and\nunsustainable renditions of it. She concludes that in order to\narticulate what instrumentalism is getting right, you have to strip\naway the psychologism. The point being emphasized just now is that the\nmotivation for this instance of the turn to action theory is\nanti-psychologism about practical rationality.\n\nOn one familiar reading of Frege (not the only reading, and we\u2019ll see\nan alternative to it shortly), the proper way to do logic is not to\nlook inward, as it were to the gears of the mind, but outward, to the\nlogical relations that hold between suitable abstract objects, and to\nread the correct inference patterns off of these. In the practical\nanalog of this move, when you look outward, away from the beliefs and\ndesires that preoccupy psychologistic theorists, what you find are\nactions, the external products of any successful deployment of\npractical reasons. So the logic of practical reasons is to be read off\nthe structure of actions in something like the way that, say,\ntruth-functional logic is to be read off the truth-functional\nrelations between propositions. This form of anti-psychologism\npreempts a worry one might have had about what was described at the\noutset as the organizing argument of the action-oriented approach. The\nproposal, recall, was to read the inference patterns off the structure\nof actions; if one were to construe this as reconstructing the process\nof practical reasoning from its product, how far would the\nreconstruction be likely to get? (Compare: there are many ways to make\na chair; you would not learn much about how chairs are fabricated by\nthinking about what chairs look like, or even about their conceptually\nnecessary features.) But Vogler\u2019s anti-psychologism insists that\nquestions about rationality are not questions about what\nprocesses of thought lead up to a decision.\n\nIntentional actions are picked out and segmented into their parts by\napplications of Anscombe\u2019s \u2018Why?\u2019-questions. (\u2018Why\nare you chopping the nuts?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m making a salad.\u2019)\nThe internal structure of actions is consequently a series of steps\ntowards a termination point (or \u2018end\u2019), a place where the\naction stops. When you make Deborah Madison\u2019s persimmon and\nhazelnut salad, you first coarsely chop the nuts; then you thinly\nslice three Fuyu persimmons crosswise and put them in a bowl along\nwith the nuts; then you add in three handfuls of trimmed watercress;\nthen you toss with the dressing \u2013 and you\u2019re done. A step can be\nshown to be rational by showing it to be a step on the way to the\ntermination point of the action that you are in the course of\nperforming. A step can be shown to be irrational by showing\nthat it\u2019s not: for instance, if you\u2019ve finished making the salad, but\nyou obsessively keep chopping nuts. Vogler allows that there may be\natomic actions, actions that do not have further actions as their\nparts; perhaps blinking is such an action. But just about any action\nwe care about will be a complex action (i.e., an action that has\nfurther actions as parts); and since we don\u2019t usually notice what we\ndon\u2019t care about, atomic actions, if there are any, are hard to come\nup with.\n\nVogler\u2019s \u2018calculative view\u2019 is accordingly that whenever\n(or perhaps, almost whenever) you have a reason to do\nsomething, you have a calculative reason, that is, a reason whose\nforce is: this is a step toward the termination point of my action.\nVogler distinguishes two subclasses: means-end reasons, and part-whole\nreasons; buying the cress is best thought of as a means to making the\nsalad, whereas chopping the nuts is properly part of making the salad.\nIt is not that she is insisting that there are no other sorts of\npractical consideration. In fact, she provides what she takes to be an\nexhaustive list of the logical forms the remaining sorts of\nconsiderations can have. (See Millgram 2006 for a brief overview.)\nRather, the claim is that when you have a reason of one of these\nfurther sorts, you must also have a calculative reason.\n\nThe connection only runs one way, however. Since considerations of\nother sorts organize, modulate and generally control actions, they\npresuppose calculative reasons. But calculative structures (and the\nreasons they give you) do not presuppose these other sorts of\nconsideration: you can just tie your shoes, and Vogler\nregards theories on which such actions must be informed by, for\nexample, a large-scale conception of the good as modeling rationality\non a psychopathology akin to paranoia. This asymmetry is what Vogler\ntakes to be the deep insight underlying instrumentalism. Because any\naction large enough to be something we care about must, if it is to\nwork, be calculatively well-formed, the means-end/part-whole\narticulation of actions is nonoptional, and consequently, we have to\npay due attention to calculative reasons. We cannot shrug off others\u2019\ncriticism of our calculative reasons, as we can shrug off their\ncriticism of, say, our pleasures. Calculative reasons are thus\nnonoptional, or binding.\n\nThis appeal to the structure of action as the foundation for practical\nrationality has dramatic consequences for substantive moral theory,\nand an easy way to see how is to consider a terminological puzzle\nraised by Vogler\u2019s presentation. She argues that her view is\ninternalist; Bernard Williams introduced the contrast between internal\nand external reasons via the connection, on the one hand, or lack of\nit, on the other, between reasons and an agent\u2019s motivational states\n(Williams 1981a); motivational states are part of an agent\u2019s\npsychology; so how can an anti-psychologistic position like Vogler\u2019s\nbe avowedly internalist? The answer to the terminological question has\nto do with Williams\u2019s own philosophical development. Following\nKorsgaard\u2019s attack on his view (Korsgaard 1996, ch. 11), Williams\nbegan (albeit without announcing the changeover) to use\n\u2018internalism\u2019 for the claim that reasons for action can\ndiffer from person to person; there\u2019s no level, however deep, at which\nthey must be the same. (Williams 1995, which gives a\nstill-psychologistic example: the alcoholic has a reason to lock up\nhis liquor cabinet and throw away the key; the virtuous person does\nnot; the explanation is that their characters rather than their\ndesires differ.) So Vogler is claiming her view to be internalist in\nthis newer sense: there are no reasons that have to be the same for\neverybody. Different people have different ends at different times;\nand since other sorts of reasons, she has argued, are optional, they\nvary from person to person as well. But if internalism is correct (and\nthis was what had interested Williams in the thesis in the first\nplace), then you can be, as the title of Vogler\u2019s book has it,\nreasonably vicious; immorality of even the most extreme kind need not\nentail irrationality.\n\nMichael Thompson\u2019s equally anti-psychologistic account of calculative\nrationality (Thompson 2008, Part II) reverses the direction of\nargument we have observed in Vogler. In the alternative reading of\nFrege which it uses as a template, what comes first is our grasp of\ninference; the inferences in the relevant part of the \u2013 as\nThompson occasionally puts it \u2013 \u201cpractical\nBegriffsschrift\u201d have actions as their subject matter.\nSo it is an account of action that is being read off the inference\npatterns (rather than the other way around), in something like the way\nthat Fregeans of this stripe take us to read the logical form of\npropositions off our command of truth-functional and quantificational\ninference. The direction of argument notwithstanding, Thompson belongs\nto the group of theorists we are considering, in that the objective of\nthe argument is to exploit an account of action in order to establish\na thesis about calculative practical reasons, namely, that those\nreasons are not psychological states such as desires or intentions.\n\n\nThe argumentative strategy is adapted from Sellars (1997, pp.\n37\u201341; it bears comparison to related arguments in Nagel, 1970,\npp. 29\u201331, and Brandom, 2001). A core practice, in this case of\nreason-giving, is identified, one that adduces only actions (and not\npsychological states); Thompson then exhibits the point of introducing\napparently psychological locutions (such as \u201cbecause I want\nto\u2026\u201d) into such a practice. The explanation is supposed\nto demonstrate that these locutions do not really name\nanything on the order of desires or intentions, but are rather a\nroundabout way of conveying information about the progress of an\nongoing course of action. We will first describe the way Thompson sets\nup the core practice, and then briefly reconstruct his argument for\nnon-psychologistic renderings of apparently psychologically oriented\nreason locutions. \n\nLike Vogler, Thompson uses Anscombian \u2018Why?\u2019-questions to\npick out intentional actions. He then draws our attention to the way\nthat grammatical aspect figures into their answers. Action\ndescriptions can be either perfective (\u201cI made the salad\u201d)\nor progressive (\u201cI\u2019m making the salad,\u201d \u201cI was\nmaking the salad\u201d). Notice that these grammatical forms are not\nmerely ornamental; they carry different implications. From the\nperfective \u201cI made a salad,\u201d it follows that at some point\nthere was a salad. From the progressive \u201cI was making a\nsalad,\u201d it doesn\u2019t follow: perhaps I was interrupted by a phone\ncall, and never got back to chopping. Thompson demarcates \u2018naive\nrationalizations\u2019 as those which deploy the progressive in\nplacing one action as part of another. (\u201cWhy are you chopping\nthe nuts?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m making a salad.\u201d) The contrast is\nwith \u2018sophisticated rationalizations\u2019, which seem to\ninvoke psychological states like desires (\u201cI want to\nmake a salad\u201d). \n\nWe can imagine a society (call it the action-theoretic state of\nnature) getting by with only naive rationalization. But there is\nroom for improvement in their practice of calculative reason-giving,\nand here\u2019s a short way to see how. Agents restricted to naive\nrationalizations will say \u201cI\u2019m Bing because I\u2019m\nAing,\u201d when Bing is an action that is a part\nof Aing, and they are Aing. But such parts of\nactions often come in sequence, one after another. So such an agent\ncan, at a particular time, be executing a containing action, i.e.,\nAing, but not executing a subsidiary action, Bing,\nif Bing is an action that is a part of Aing, but one\nwhich comes earlier or later on in the sequence. Now, if, at a\nparticular time, an agent is not executing an action (again,\nBing), then when someone asks if he\u2019s Bing, he\u2019ll\nsay he\u2019s not. So it\u2019s easy to put agents restricted to naive\nrationalizations in the position of saying both that they\u2019re\nBing, and that they\u2019re not Bing. (E.g., \u201cI\u2019m\nBing because I\u2019m Aing, but I\u2019m not\nBing.\u201d) That\u2019s potentially confusing. \n\nWe can suppose that such agents will adopt devices to obviate the\nconfusion. For instance, they\u2019ll learn to say (as we do), \u201cI\u2019m\nBing tomorrow.\u201d Against that background, however,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to B,\u201d \u201cI want to\nA,\u201d and so on are evidently similar devices, and of a\npiece with \u201cI\u2019m Bing tomorrow.\u201d Each such\nlocution carries a different sort of additional information. For\ninstance, \u201cI\u2019m going to B\u201d positions one as being\nin the very preliminary run-up phases of an action; when one says,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to B because I\u2019m Aing,\u201d one\nis giving a naive rationalization, but one which registers that the\nBing phase of Aing has not yet arrived, even though\nthe reason for the former is that it is part of the latter. Likewise,\n\u201cI intend to A\u201d places one merely at the planning\nphase of Aing; \u201cI want to A,\u201d allows\nthat one may be at a pre-planning phase. Briefly, the function of\nthese locutions is to preempt confusion by placing the actions that\nmake up a naive rationalization in their temporal sequence. But once\nwe see that that is their function, the temptation to\nconstrue them as invoking psychological states (intentions, desires\nand so on) is evidently misguided. Desires, in Thompson\u2019s Sellarsian\nview, are a mistake on a par with sense-data; just as the sense-datum\ntheorist treats a linguistic device for hedging one\u2019s commitments\n(\u201cIt appears to be\u2026\u201d) as naming a psychological\nstate (a mere appearance), so the belief-desire theorist of practical\nrationality is treating a linguistic device for sorting out the order\nof subsidiary actions (\u201c\u2026because I want\nto\u2026\u201d) as naming a motivating psychological state (a\ndesire). \n\nLike Vogler\u2019s calculative view, Thompson\u2019s account of calculative\npractical reasons is motivated by anti-psychologism. Unlike Vogler,\nhowever, he is not arguing for restricting the mandatory part of\npractical rationality to calculative reasons; other parts of Life\nand Action discuss very different but evidently nonoptional forms\nof practical inference. Vogler, we saw, was concessive about the\npossibility of atomic actions; Thompson gives a surprising argument to\nthe effect that all actions have further actions as their proper\nparts. (See Millgram 2009, sec. 9.4, for a brief reconstruction.) So\nalthough the two views are closely related, they also differ on many\npoints. \n2. The Authorship View of Action\n\nA second approach takes the essential feature of action to be, not its\nstepwise structure, but that it is authored; there is no such\nthing as an action without an owner, in something like the way that\nthere is no such thing as a belief without an owner. The two most\ndeveloped positions of this kind are due to Christine M. Korsgaard and\nJ. David Velleman.\n\nOn Korsgaard\u2019s view, what gives an action an owner is that it is\nattributable to the person as a whole (rather than to a subpersonal\npart, such as a drive or an especially strong desire). Whole-person\nattributions require a constitution, a form of psychic\norganization and regulation that is the smaller-scale analog of the\npolitical constitution of a state. Constitutions are made up of the\nprocedures by which actions are to be produced; actions are owned, and\nso are full-fledged actions, only when they are so produced (Korsgaard\n2008, ch. 3, Korsgaard 2009).\n\nThe principles of practical rationality are the procedures, at a\nsuitably abstract level of description, of a satisfactory\nconstitution. So, and in contrast to Vogler\u2019s view, Korsgaard\u2019s theory\nof practical rationality is psychologistic. Actions have explanatory\npriority, but actions are the starting point of an argument used to\ndetermine the proper structure of an agent\u2019s psychology: that is, we\nask what psychological structure an agent must have in place for him\nto be able to author actions. And that psychology in turn determines\nwhat the correct forms of practical inference must be. The\nphilosophical motivations of Korsgaard\u2019s position are in part\nforensic: the connection between actions and agents must be such that\nwe can hold agents responsible for what they do. More importantly,\nhowever, the account is meant to explain why your reasons are binding:\nwhat their \u2018normative force\u2019 is. \n\nHere is a first-pass thumbnail sketch of that explanation: We have to\nact, because anything we do will be an action. Chairs are to sit on,\nand so a chair you can\u2019t sit on is defective; being something you can\nsit on is a constitutive standard for chairs. Likewise, there are\nconstitutive standards for actions, in just that way; a would-be\naction that did not conform to them would also be defective. In\nKorsgaard\u2019s view, the question of why an item should conform to the\nconstitutive standards for its type \u2018answers itself\u2019\n(Korsgaard 2008, p. 61). So if she can show that deploying reasons\nsatisfying one or another requirement is a constitutive standard for\naction \u2013 and the requirements she is going to argue for are\nKantian \u2013 that will amount to showing why you should act on\nreasons that satisfy those Kantian requirements. Before we proceed to\nthat argument, notice that we are starting to see how the\nphilosophical motivations of the work we are surveying differ from\nprogram to program; the contrast between psychologistic and\nanti-psychologistic agendas is not the only, or even the most\nimportant, dimension of variation.\n\nKorsgaard contrasts acts (such as setting the table) with actions\n(such as setting the table to be ready before the guests arrive). Her\nview is that acts and the ends for which they are performed make up an\naction when they are bound together by a principle, which must be\nformally universal (e.g., always set the table before the guests\narrive). We have already noted that actions must be attributable to\nagents, and an action is properly an agent\u2019s only when it is produced\nby the agent as a whole. For attribution to be contentful, there must\nbe a real distinction between your actions, on the one hand,\nand events that resemble actions but are produced by your psychic\nparts, on the other; we can make out such a distinction only if you\nidentify with a principle of choice, where that is universal in form.\n(We won\u2019t reconstruct her arguments for that last claim here; Millgram\n2011 gives a summary.) Consequently, reasons for action must be\nuniversal in form, and this entails, or so Korsgaard argues, the\nsubstantive correctness of Kantian moral theory, at any rate that part\nof it which imposes a universalizability requirement on practical\nreasons: very roughly, it must be possible for you and everyone else\njointly to act on the basis of that universal-in-form principle,\nwithout assuring the frustration of the end it mentions. (For further\ndescription of Kant\u2019s account, see the section on the universal law of\nnature formula in the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.)\n \n\nWhile it\u2019s no part of the present task to defend or resist the\ncompeting views about action and practical reason under review, in\nthis case the easiest way to get Korsgaard\u2019s position into focus is by\nconsidering how it can address a handful of worries, and the first of\nthese has already given rise to a small literature. Allow for the\nmoment that actions, understood as Korsgaard proposes, involve\nconstitutive standards. Still, why must we produce actions?\nThe point that anything you do will be an action is likely to be\ngranted only on the thinnest and most minimal reading of what an\naction is; but we have just seen Korsgaard distinguishing between more\nminimal \u2018acts\u2019 and more ambitiously structured\n\u2018actions\u2019. Actions are constituted by acts together with\ntheir ends; why can\u2019t you instead act aimlessly, like the characters\nin Richard Linklater\u2019s Slacker? If the penalty is that you\nwill thereby be a defective agent, why can\u2019t the slacker shrug off\nthat complaint, perhaps with the remark that agents and actions come\nwith one set of constitutive standards, and slackers and their\nless-than-actions come with others? Why should the slacker be held to\nthe standards for agency as opposed to those of slackerhood?\nKorsgaard\u2019s argument appears to involve the sleight-of-hand\nsubstitution of an ambitious and optional notion of action for a\nminimal and more plausibly nonoptional one. (For the back and forth,\nsee Enoch 2006, Ferrero 2009, Tubert 2010, Katsafanas 2013, ch. 2.)\n\n\nKorsgaard\u2019s response comes in three laps. First, she inherits from\nWittgenstein the thought that normativity involves the possibility of\ncorrection, and she infers that if there is to be any normativity, it\nmust be possible to be in violation of a standard. Now, you can be\ncounted as in violation of a standard only if you can\u2019t simply shrug\nthe correction off. But if you can switch the kind an item counts as\nbelonging to, at will, then you can shrug off any standard\nand any correction; as Korsgaard puts it, nothing will be defective,\n\u2018everything will just be different.\u2019 (E.g., \u2018I\u2019ve\ndecided I\u2019m not an agent but a slacker, so the standards for agents\ndon\u2019t apply to me.\u2019) Thus we must take there to be kinds such\nthat you can\u2019t just shrug and say that you don\u2019t see why the\nconstitutive standards of the kind apply. This first lap of the\nargument has the look and feel of an existence proof, and of softening\nup; in particular, it doesn\u2019t purport to show that the twin concepts,\n\u2018action\u2019 and \u2018agent,\u2019 are among these\nprivileged kinds (Korsgaard 2009, sec. 2.1.8).\n\nBefore turning to the second lap of Korsgaard\u2019s response, let\u2019s\nintroduce a second worry: that the argument\u2019s attempt to exploit the\nwholeness of the agent, allegedly the essential feature of agency, is\ntaking a wrong turn. Recall Korsgaard\u2019s artifactual analogy: a chair\nis something you sit on, and so a chair is defective when you can\u2019t\nsit on it \u2013 and of course it\u2019s defective as a whole, because its\njob, as a whole chair, is to be a seat. For any constitutive\nstandard, it\u2019s the thing as a whole that\u2019s supposed to live up to the\nstandard; so what\u2019s distinctive about one standard or another is what\nthe thing does or is, and not that it does it, or is it, as a whole.\nIf, when it came to understanding chairs, you devoted your theoretical\nattention to that \u2018as a whole,\u2019 as opposed to the seating,\nsomething would clearly have gone wrong. (Imagine a theorist of chairs\narguing that the constitutive standards for being a chair must be met\nby the chair as a whole, and thus the essential feature of chairs, and\nthe key to understanding them, is that they hold themselves together.)\nWhy isn\u2019t Korsgaard\u2019s focus on the shared unity condition some sort of\nred herring? \n\nBut people, Korsgaard claims, are not just like chairs. (Actually,\nthere\u2019s a subplot in which she argues that chairs are more like people\nthan you\u2019d think, but here I\u2019m going to leave it to one side.) Chairs\ndon\u2019t dissolve into their parts when they\u2019re not seating anyone,\nwhereas an agent constitutes itself by acting, or ceases to\nbe an agent entirely. Imagine that Invasion of the Body\nSnatchers had it almost right: as in the film, pod creatures from\nouter space are eliminating us one by one, and replacing us with\npod-grown impersonators; it is just that the films have gotten the\nsize of the pods wrong. Instead of being as large as a person, each\npod is roughly the size of a peapod, and so it takes a great many pod\ncreatures working together to impersonate a single Earthling. (The\nillustration adapts the argument of Korsgaard 1996, ch. 13, to fit her\nlater use of group agency as a model for individual agency.) If a\ncolony of pod creatures is going to succeed in fooling the remaining\nEarthlings, it will have to behave as a single person, and to do that,\nthe activities of the different pod creatures must be closely\ncoordinated; after all, if the pod creatures making up the feet go off\nin one direction, and the pod creatures making up the torso go off in\na different direction, no one will be fooled. When the pod creatures\nact together, and pull off the deception, they make themselves\ninto a collective agent. (One mark of this is the first-person\nindexical, as when they whisper to each other, \u2018We\u2019re\nnow going to go off to the left\u2019; their coordination induces a\npoint of view which is not that of any particular one of them.) That\u2019s\nwhy action has to be generated by you-as-a-whole, rather than your\npsychic parts. \n\nAt this point we can see why you\u2019re not supposed to be able to opt for\nslackerdom. There are things we have to get done, in\nsomething like the way that the pod creatures have to fool\nAunt Millie into thinking they\u2019re her husband Melvin; acting is our\n\u2018plight, the simple inexorable fact of the human\ncondition\u2019 (Korsgaard 2009, sec. 1.1.1). And that means\nproducing actions, not mere acts; you act because there are things you\nhave to get done, and so when you act, you normally have an end in\nview; to act with an end in view is to perform an action. Acting is\nconstituting yourself as an agent out of your desires and other\npsychological elements, in much the way that the pod creatures\nconstitute themselves as a group agent. The necessity of agency is not\nmetaphysical but practical. (This amounts to a reply to the objection\nthat the argument for the ineluctability of action involved a sleight\nof hand: that a series of interlocking definitions, purporting to show\nthat you have no alternative to acting because nothing will\ncount as an alternative to action, could not amount to a\nreason not to live like a slacker. The objection is misconstruing\nKorsgaard\u2019s argument as turning on definitional rather than practical\nnecessities.)\n\nNow we can further see \u2013 although this is a shortcut rather than\nthe argument \u2013 why constituting oneself as an agent involves\nendorsing a principle. Suppose one of the pod creatures whispers to\nits nearby fellows, \u2018Off to the left!\u2019 If enough of them\nfollow to tilt the ersatz Uncle Melvin leftwards, was that an action,\nattributable to the group agent, or just that one pod creature\nmomentarily getting its way? Suppose a moment later a different pod\ncreature whispers \u2018Off to the right!\u2019 and ersatz Melvin\nteeters back; Aunt Millie will notice that something is amiss. To\navoid this sort of back and forth, the pod creatures collectively have\nto adopt a general principle of action \u2013 perhaps, \u2018When\nmimicking Earthlings, coordinate the movements of individual pods in\nsuch and such a way.\u2019 And in acting on that principle, they\nthereby constitute themselves into a (in this case, collective) agent.\n\n\nLet\u2019s pause to mark some of the contrasts between two of the theories\nof practical inference we have on the table. First of all, Kantian\nmaxims \u2013 the structured intentions on which the\nuniversalizability requirement is imposed \u2013 have means-end or\ncalculative structure: a maxim typically specifies not just what you\nare proposing to achieve, but how you propose to proceed. So Vogler\u2019s\nrequirement, that one come up with actions that are calculatively\nwell-formed, is compatible with Korsgaard\u2019s view. But because Vogler\nregards noncalculative reasons as optional, Korsgaard and Vogler\ndiffer over whether the universalizability of maxims is mandatory. Now\nbecause the universalizability test (the so-called CI-procedure) is to\nbe applied to one\u2019s maxims as they arise, and because you may at any\npoint consider an unprecedented maxim, it is still an open question\njust what the substantive moral theory generated by this theory of\npractical reasoning is. However, a handful of canonical dicta are\nusually thought of as constituting its core: not to lie; to adopt the\nend of helping others; to adopt the end of developing one\u2019s talents.\nSo, second, we are seeing differing conceptions of action give rise to\nstarkly differing views of the moral demands of rationality; on\nVogler\u2019s view, the solely calculative conception of action allows for\nrational agents who lie, cynically exploit others, and don\u2019t bother to\nimprove themselves. So Korsgaard\u2019s account is morally more demanding,\nand it is morally more demanding because it is more demanding about\nwhat it takes to be an action, as opposed to mere bodily or mental\ngoings on.\n\nAn important contrast between these views has to do with how the\nattributability of action is understood. Anscombian accounts construe\nthe attribution of action as having to do with the special way in\nwhich you know what you\u2019re doing \u2013 that is, without looking to\nsee, the way other people have to (R\u00f6dl 2007, ch. 2, Small 2012).\nSince you just know what you\u2019re doing, its being\nyour action takes care of itself; whereas we\u2019ve seen that in\nKorsgaard\u2019s picture, action attribution is a task each agent has to\ntake care of for himself, and arises out of meeting the\nexigencies of agency. If Kantian moral theory is to be nonoptional\n\u2013 something we can\u2019t just turn our backs on \u2013 the\nnoncalculative Kantian reasons must be nonoptional. If the\nnoncalculative reasons are what it takes to have action that is\nauthored, then the ownership of actions must be demonstrably\nnonoptional. That necessity, we have seen, is practical; that is, it\u2019s\nthe necessity of \u2018gotta go, right now!\u2019 But if that is the\nright way to reconstruct Korsgaard\u2019s position, there is a final worry\nto register, one that we are not yet able to meet, but to which we\nwill return briefly when the time comes to assess the state of play of\nthe field we are surveying. \n\nWe generally take arguments built around practical necessity to be\nresponsible to and modulated by the urgency and force of the\nnecessity. The point is once again easier to see when we are\nconsidering collective agents, so let us take up Korsgaard\u2019s political\nanalogy once more. A state that aspires to having all activity within\nits jurisdiction be its own actions is totalitarian. Democratic states\nas we are familiar with them sometimes do mobilize themselves in a way\nthat approximates this extreme: usually, in times of all-out war. (For\ninstance, during WWII, the American government imposed rationing,\nmanaged a great deal of industrial production directly, and so on.)\nBut when there is no such occasion, liberals regard totalitarianism as\nan unreasonable and immoral mode of political organization, and prefer\na state in which most activity within the state is not attributable to\nit. Markets are a familiar instance of an alternative form of\ncoordination: in a market economy, market outcomes are less than\nchoices on the part of the government, and are not directly\nattributable to the state. Recall that the argument for action\nattribution turned on the need to avoid mutually frustrating\nactivities, as when the pod creatures pull in different directions. A\nmarket economy, however, pits competitors against each other; in this\napproach, coordination of activities does not consist in forestalling\ncompetition, but in creating a regulatory framework for it. If the\nanalogy goes through, action in Korsgaard\u2019s sense is inevitable only\nto the extent that practical pressures on human agency are such as to\nmake totalitarian rather than, say, market-like approaches to the\norganization of individual activity mandatory. So the final worry is\nthat we do not yet understand the ongoing practical demands warranting\nforms of coordination that underwrite the full attributability of\naction, making the latter a demand always to be met. \n\nKorsgaard\u2019s response to this worry, which is also the final lap of her\nresponse to the initial worry, is an argument that you cannot choose\nto have a character with fault lines in it, one whose unity is\n\u2018contingent and unstable\u2019 (2009, 8.5.2). That argument is\ntoo opaque to permit an uncontroversial reconstruction, and instead I\nwill conclude the exposition of her position by describing the\nchallenge the argument is meant to meet. On Korsgaard\u2019s view, the\npractical necessity of reconstituting one\u2019s agency, from moment to\nmoment, must be a formal feature of any human personality. However, in\nour ordinary ways of thinking, practical necessities are substantive\nand contingent pressures (in our earlier example, the demands of\nwartime, as experienced by a state). When ersatz Uncle Milton is out\nof sight, it looks like the pod creatures get to relax; but\nyou are never allowed to take breaks from being an agent. The\nformal feature of agency that replaces those substantive pressures is\nthe commitment to sustain one\u2019s agency in any circumstances\nwhatsoever: \u2018our principles, moral principles, are supposed to\nhold us together in any environment, any circumstance, come what\nmay\u2019 (Korsgaard 2009, sec. 5.5.3). That commitment is supposed\nto be what makes action, rather than a more loosely organized\nalternative to it, always our plight. \n\nWe turn now to the second of the positions that takes authorship to be\nthe essential feature of action. Like Korsgaard, Velleman takes action\n\u2013 \u201chuman action par excellence,\u201d as\ncontrasted with mere activity \u2013 to be owned (Velleman 2015, 101\nand ch. 5, passim). Like Korsgaard, he takes ownership to\nrequire a definite structure in an agent, and again like her, he takes\nthe forms of practical reasoning (and what practical reasons\nsubstantively will turn out to be) to be determined by the agent\u2019s\nstructure. However, he disagrees with Korsgaard as to what the\nstructure of an agent is, as to what its practical reasons are, and\nincidentally with Korsgaard\u2019s insistence that being authored by the\nagent as a whole means not being authored by a proper part of the\nagent. Velleman\u2019s position will make more sense if we bear in mind\nthat it has more than one agenda; accordingly we will juxtapose two\ncomplementary entry points, and subsequently suggest that what looks\nlike a third and independent motivation for the view is reachable from\nthose.\n\nThe sense of ownership in play in Velleman\u2019s view is inherited\nfrom an older debate about freedom of the will and autonomy, and it\nhas to do with whether the agent can honestly dissociate himself from\nhis action or motivation (e.g., \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really me\nspeaking; it was just the alcohol\u201d). One might think that this\nsort of dissociation could be overcome by a further endorsement\n(\u201cIt really\nwas me speaking\u201d), but a familiar difficulty is that\nmany forms of endorsement merely raise the problem anew: ownership\ncannot be identified with an endorsement when the agent can dissociate\nhimself from that endorsement as well (Velleman 2015, 295\u2013296). There\nis by now an extensive literature on agency built up of rounds of this\nback-and-forth, and here is a very quick taste of it. Harry Frankfurt\nhad suggested that a desire is full-fledgedly yours when you have a\nsuitable second-order desire (a desire that the initial desire\nmotivate you to act; Frankfurt 1971); Gary Watson pointed out that\nFrankfurt\u2019s proposal merely pushed the question back to whether that\nsecond-order desire was full-fledgedly yours, and he proposed fit with\nyour values as an alternative account (Watson 1975). But the rejoinder\nwas of course to ask what makes a set of values full-fledgedly your\nown (Benson 1987), and the problem seemed to take on the shape of a\nhard-to-halt regress. (For more on this debate, see Section 2 of the\nentry on\n free will.)\n\nVelleman\u2019s way of terminating the regress is to locate a\npsychological element from which an agent cannot dissociate himself\n(2015, chs. 5, 7). Because to act is to act for reasons, an agent\ncannot dissociate himself from a desire to act for reasons \u2013\nnot, that is, without ceasing to be an agent. (Treat the content of\nthat desire as a temporary placeholder; we\u2019ll return to it\nshortly.) When such a desire contributes in the canonical manner to\nproducing an action (say, by weighing in on the side of other desires\nthat it endorses, and so tipping the decision toward that action), we\nsay that the agent produces the action (in something like the way that\nwhen your intestines digest food, we say that you are digesting the\nfood). So, to recapitulate, actions are in the first\nplace owned; an action is owned, in the relevant sense, when\nit cannot be disowned; the only anchor for an action that an agent\ncannot disown in turn, without ceasing to be an agent, is (roughly)\nthe desire to act for reasons. So what it takes to be an action is to\nbe (appropriately) produced by such a desire.\n\nAn action is what is produced by the operation of this desire, and so\nthis desire amounts to the constitutive aim of action (in something\nlike the way, Velleman thinks, that truth is the constitutive aim of\nbelief [2015, ch. 10]). It will thus serve to determine what putative\nreasons for action are (good) practical reasons (in something\nlike the way that truth determines what reasons for belief are good\nreasons). But then its content cannot quite be: to act for reasons.\nFor that would amount to a viciously circular and vacuous\nspecification of the constitutive aim of action.\n\nVelleman\u2019s alternative specification of the content is (roughly\nagain, because there is some room for variation) to know what one is\ndoing when one acts, or to make sense to oneself when one acts\n(Velleman 1989). So what counts as a (good) practical reason is that\nwhich will make one\u2019s actions intelligible to one, when one\nperforms them.  Velleman seems originally to have had something like\nthe following schema in mind: desires motivate, and so explain\nactions; so when you act on the basis of a desire, your action makes\nsense to you; so when your desire to make sense to yourself, together\nwith more occasion-specific desires, produces an action serving the\noccasion-specific desires, that is a full-fledged action on your own\npart, and not mere activity. \n\nThat default schema looks to be a version of the authorship view of\naction supporting an instrumentalist or means-end (rather than, as in\nKorsgaard\u2019s development of it, a Kantian) account of practical\nreasons. However, as Velleman\u2019s position has evolved, he has\nsuggested further patterns. Often one emotion naturally gives rise to\na sequel, as when in one familiar pop-psychology meme, denial of a\nloss is supposed to be followed by anger, which is in turn succeeded\nby bargaining, which is followed by, ultimately, acceptance. Such\nemotion cascades are the spines of narratives, and an action is\nrendered narratively intelligible as following on a step of such a\ncascade (Velleman 2009, 191, 194\u2013197). Thus, when supported by a\ndesire to be intelligible to oneself, narratives give rise to\nactions. So instrumental reasons have been supplemented by what\nVelleman construes as narrative reasons, and in later work, Velleman\nhas further proposed character for the explanatory role (2009, ch. 1):\nif you stay in character (in rather the way that actors on stage aim\nat), what you do will make sense to you, and if you are motivated by\nthe desire to make sense to yourself, what you then do will count as\nan action. (A bit of nuance: in his earlier work, Velleman took the\nrelevant desire to be a substantive motivation, on a par with other\ndesires in the cognitive mix, but he has since relaxed the\ncharacterization; we can perhaps more properly think of it as a drive,\nimplemented as a structural feature of a cognitive system, rather than\none of the items moved around inside that system; compare Velleman\n2015, pp. 169, 246.) \n\nNow, notice what one\u2019s reasons for action will turn out to be,\nformally. Once again, because reasons for action are picked out as\nwhat would explain one\u2019s actions, we cannot, on pain of circularity,\ngloss what it is to be a satisfactory explanation of an action as\nbeing a practical reason (cf. Velleman 2009, 40). So we will instead\nrely on an already available notion of explanation and, Velleman\nconcludes, it must be theoretical, i.e., logically the same\nsort of explanation that would account for any matter of fact.\nReturning to the default schema for an illustration, desires are\nreasons because they (potentially) explain action, and they explain\naction in the first place because they causally explain it.\n\n\nThere is a second and equally important motivation for the position.\nIt is almost unquestioned common ground in this field that there are\ntwo deeply different but parallel modes of rationality: theoretical\nand practical. Of these, philosophers tend to see inference about\nmatters of fact as relatively unproblematic; to a first approximation,\nit is in order when you reliably derive truths from truths. Practical\nreasoning is seen as an analogous enterprise, one which is, however,\nmuch more opaque: because it determines what to do, as opposed to what\nto believe, it is much less clear when it is being executed correctly.\nVelleman\u2019s move is to eliminate the commonly accepted distinction by\nreducing practical to theoretical rationality, and thereby reduce the\nproblem of the correctness of practical inference to problems in the\nphilosophy of explanation. \n\nWe have already seen how reasons for action are understood as\nexplanations of fact; facts explain facts; so the move further\nrequires construing decisions as factual conclusions of some kind, and\nthe live candidate is that they are predictions of one\u2019s own\nactions (Velleman 2015, ch. 3). They differ from other predictions in\nbeing self-fulfilling. (Though obviously not just any self-fulfilling\nprediction will serve: as Anscombe observed, \u2018I\u2019m going to\nbe sick\u2019 does not normally express an intention \u2013 and it\ndoesn\u2019t even if the thought of being sick is what brings on the\nnausea, and even if you can predict the nausea on the basis of what\nyou have just eaten.)  Thus, and returning to our theme, an action\nproper will be the process of such a prediction fulfilling itself. And\nso practical reasoning will be the explanation of future behavior that\nunderwrites the self-fulfilling prediction of that behavior. \n\nA third motivation, which is at first glance independent, is that of\naccounting for a thesis that has received a great deal of airplay\nrecently, namely, that when you act, you know what you\u2019re doing.\nWhen you do things in order to make sense to yourself, you end up by\nand large knowing what you\u2019re doing; thus the pervasiveness of\npractical self-knowledge is explained by invoking a desire for it. The\ndesire is claimed both to be constitutive of agency, and announced to\nbe empirically present in a normal human psychology. Now, a common\nresponse to Velleman\u2019s insistence (2009, 136\u2013138, 2015, 325)\nthat people want to understand what they\u2019re doing \u2013\nmoreover, that this is part and parcel of their desire to understand\nthe universe of which they are a part \u2013 is incredulity. A quick\nreminder or two of where those responses are coming from: academics\nteaching large introductory courses look out on seas of apathetic\nfaces that don\u2019t seem to care about understanding much at all;\noutside the classroom, those same academics are committed to research\n\u2013 which, as the saying has it, is what you\u2019re doing when\nyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. And nonacademics rub\nshoulders with New Age aficionados of mystery, with defeated\nindividuals who have made compromises in life they would rather not\nthink about... briefly, with people who quite visibly would prefer not\nto understand what they are doing, even as they do it. Now, Velleman\nadduces the cognitive dissonance and attribution literatures as\nfurther confirming evidence (Velleman 2009, 37f; Cooper 2007 is an\noverview of the former), but his readers balk here also: after all,\nthe striking feature of cognitive dissonance reduction is that\nsubjects are unaware that they exhibit it, and are perturbed when it\nis pointed out to them. And indeed Velleman notices that what he\n\u2018regard[s] as the height of rationality\u2019 others\n\u2018tend to regard... as irrational\u2019 (2009, 92 n. 4).\nBecause what Velleman takes as practical rationality in operation\nseems irrational to the agents themselves, it requires, precisely, not\nunderstanding what one is doing. \n\nHowever, the thesis that one desires practical self-knowledge was\nreached from the entry points we have already introduced, and if our\nreading of the pressures on the view is correct, the inalienable drive\ntoward self-knowledge is best construed as a cognitive\nrequirement, one derived from, first, the need to anchor\naction attribution and, second, the demand that practical rationality\nbe reduced to theoretical rationality. \n\nLet\u2019s briefly turn to a handful of apparent difficulties, as a\nway of bringing the view into clearer focus and indicating some of its\nresources. First, the question of what counts as a practical reason\ngets deferred, in Velleman\u2019s position, to a philosophical account of\ntheoretical explanation. We noticed in passing that not every\npredictive technique will deliver reasons for action. (Another\ninstance: one can often predict one\u2019s choices as the mistakes one is\nprone to make, but to treat what you understand to be a mistake as a\nreason is next door to a Moore\u2019s Paradox.)\nSo Velleman must in some\nway restrict the scope of the considerations that can figure into\none\u2019s self-fulfilling predictions. There is not just one type of\nprivileged explanation that will serve; recall that Velleman allows\nboth narrative and desire-driven folk-psychological explanations,\nperhaps along with others. The reader is directed to remarks which are\nevidently meant to address the issue of the required scope restriction\n(Velleman 2009, 31f, 42f; cf. also 2006, 7f, 14); the move doesn\u2019t\nlend itself to a terse reconstruction or assessment, and here we will\nleave the intended resolution open. \n\nNext, the picture of action and agency in question, on which you\n(always, exceptionlessly) decide what to do by asking yourself what\nsomeone like you would do, might sound both implausible and\nunattractive. (Implausible: it assimilates many substantively\ndifferent forms of decision to one of them; unattractive: agents are\nturned inward, in the manner iconized by the tradition of absorption\npainting [Fried 1988] \u2013 and it is perhaps no accident that Velleman\n2006 appropriates an image from this tradition as its cover art.) But\nVelleman has a response. True enough, if you were constantly busied\nwith and focused on understanding yourself, something would have gone\nwrong; but practical reasoning is itself a sporadic activity.\nPractical rationality is, as he puts it in a vivid metaphor, in the\npassenger rather than the driver\u2019s seat (Velleman 2015, ch. 13). Most\nof the time, you\u2019re on autopilot; on his supervisory conception of\npractical reasoning, as long as you know what\u2019s going on, the\nsupervisor does not need to intervene. Evidently, this solution has a\ncost, that of attenuating the connection between action and its\nconstitutive motivation; Velleman\u2019s response to the problem is recent,\nand it\u2019s unclear what we should expect in the way of downstream\nadjustments to the earlier position. Nonetheless, this is a dramatic\nmove, on a par with the decision to assimilate practical to\ntheoretical reasoning, and it merits careful attention. (He has two\nsecondary responses to the problem, which the interested reader can\nfind at Velleman 2009, 23f and 27f.) \n\nThird, there might look to be a pair of related circularities hidden\nin Velleman\u2019s account. The presumption that desires or more generally\nmotivations explain action is plausibly a legacy of a theory of\npractical rationality on which desires are reasons for action\n\u2013 and therefore, it is concluded, their causes. (As Quinn 1994,\n236\u2013239, points out, if desires are thought of as brute causes,\ndesire-driven behavior looks like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,\nrather than rational action.) Similarly, the idea that a given emotion\nnaturally generates a particular successor emotion has often been\ntaken to be the result of training in narrative forms, patterns that\nmust be already culturally available. (For something like\nthis latter view, see Nussbaum 1992, ch. 12; Velleman responds at\n2009, 199 n. 15.) So theories of practical or narrative rationality\nwould come first, because they are presupposed by causal explanations\nappealing to desires or narratives (2009, 26f). Such theories would\nrender the account viciously circular, and (the objection concludes)\nare off-limits to Velleman\u2019s project. \n\nVelleman has an answer waiting in the wings, however. (Bear in mind that here\nwe are connecting a few of the dots in a way that hasn\u2019t been\nspelled out before.) Velleman, like other theorists we have surveyed,\nhas a finish line in moral theory, a position he calls \u2018kinda\nKantian\u2019: because our lives are pervaded by the motivation to\nunderstand ourselves, over time that motivation, even if it is not\nvery strong, is likely to have deep effects; specifically, by way of\nmaking ourselves easier to understand, we will simplify our typology\nof persons, removing asymmetries in the social roles that we occupy,\nand gradually come to be agents for whom Kantian moral theory\nis a pretty decent fit. That treatment can serve as a model for\nunderstanding the psychological processes to which Velleman appeals,\nand render the circularities we were floating no longer vicious:\nperhaps we have gradually come to be agents of whom belief-desire\npsychology is true, and in whom one particular emotion naturally\nfollows on another, because conforming to these simple-minded theories\nsimplified our personal and social lives, making it easier for us to\nunderstand ourselves. In that case, the causal factors these views\ninvoke are now elements of straightforwardly causal explanations; it\nno longer matters how they got that way. \n\nRecapping, on one authorship view of action, an action is a prediction\nbeing enacted in part on the basis of a designated motivation, and\npractical reasons are the explanatory support for such predictions.\nAnd a second such view is held to support a theory on which only\nuniversalizable maxims count as practical reasons. We are also seeing\nthat authorship views of action may have strikingly different\nphilosophical motivations: in one case, to account for the bindingness\nor normativity of reasons; in the other case, to assimilate practical\nto theoretical reasoning, as well as a need to make room for a certain\nsort of first-person authority about one\u2019s will.\n\nWe mentioned at the outset that the work of theorists in this area\ndoes not usually speak to other work of the same kind. Paul Katsafanas\nis a recent exception to this generalization. Some types of\nexplanation may produce more in the way of self-knowledge than others;\nsome principles may unify an agent more deeply or robustly. But\nKatsafanas 2013, chs. 3 and 4, argues that neither Velleman nor\nKorsgaard is in a position to show that having more rather than less\nof, respectively, the former or the latter feature is a constitutive\nend of action; consequently, neither has the resources to reconstruct\nthe comparative notion we need, that of one\u2019s having more\nreason to pursue one course of action than another.\n\nWe now turn to Katsafanas\u2019s positive view. \n3. The Challenge-Seeking View of Action\n\nActions, Katsafanas holds, are generated by drives. (Katsafanas 2013,\nch. 6; he attributes most of the elements of his view to Nietzsche,\nthis among them, but here we won\u2019t be concerned with whether the\nhistorical claim is correct.) So if there is a characteristic that\nactions must have insofar as they are generated by drives, then all\nactions have it. \n\nDrives are characterized by their aims \u2013 for instance, the aim of the\nshopping drive is having lots of stuff \u2013 and they generate objects\n(typically, objects of desire), which are formally a very different\nmatter. When an object is attained (continuing the illustration, when\nyou bring home that gewgaw from the craft fair), the desire for it\nevaporates, and you are satiated; but after a while, the drive\ngenerates a new object (now a garment, which seems to you a steal at\n30% off). Drives working this way, that is, generating one object of\ndesire after another, can be characterized more deeply as directed\ntoward encountering and overcoming resistance. \n\nNow actions are the products of choice, and often enough of\ndeliberation; when you deliberate, you take the outcome of\ndeliberation to settle what you are going to do. (If you did not, you\nwould merely be attempting to predict what you are going to do, in\njust the way you might attempt to predict the actions of other\npeople.) Even when deliberation is absent, choice involves assessment,\nand the assessment, whether deliberative or not, determines you to act\nonly if you approve of the action; therefore, actions aspire to be\nactive, where that means that you approve of what you do, and\nfurther, that if you understood what the motivational inputs to that\ndeliberative runup to the action really were, you\nwould continue to approve (Katsafanas 2013, ch. 5).   That last demand\ncovers all of those inputs, and not just the official ones (as when you claim to be weighing the pros and cons of a request, but are also responsive to the attractiveness, social class, or gender of the one making it). \n\nBecause actions are produced by drives, you can only be fully active\nif you approve of your drives\u2019 role; that in turn requires approving\nof the drives\u2019 primary structural feature, namely, their ongoing\nproduction of challenging goals. It follows that whenever we do\nsomething, we have (or aspire to have, if we are less than fully\nactive) a further aim (which, borrowing Nietzsche\u2019s vocabulary,\nKatsafanas dubs \u2018will to power\u2019): that of selecting and structuring\nour activities so that they involve challenges we will exert ourselves\nin meeting. \n\nAs in Velleman\u2019s view, the upshot is that your various reasons are\ninvariably accompanied by a further reason: not, as in Velleman\u2019s\ncase, wanting to know what you are doing and to understand yourself,\nbut rather an interest in choosing more rather than less challenging\n\u2013 but nonetheless attainable \u2013 objectives. Katsafanas takes this\ninterest to answer the complaint he directed at authorship views of\naction. If you approve of an aim, you want to achieve it to the\ngreatest extent possible; therefore, if you are active, you are\ncommitted to more rather than to less challenging activities.\n(Although this underwrites the contrast between having more and having\nless reason to do something, Katsafanas does not regard it as inducing\nthe commensurability of reasons across the board.) He also takes it to\nhave consequences for substantive moral theory; just for instance,\nbecause the struggle to overcome resistance involves suffering, that\nsort of suffering counts as a good thing. \n4. The Practice View of Action\n\nIn an early, influential, and Wittgenstein-influenced paper, John\nRawls introduced the notion of a practice as a generalization\nor extension of the notion of a game (Rawls 1955). The important\nfeature of a practice for our purposes is that it introduces statuses\nwhich are internal to it. For instance, in baseball, such statuses\nmight include being a \u2018foul\u2019, a \u2018strike\u2019, and\nso on; whatever what you\u2019re doing looks like, it can\u2019t be a (baseball)\nfoul if you\u2019re not playing baseball. A practice thereby introduces\nstandards; since something is a \u2018home run\u2019 only by virtue\nof the fact that what is being played is baseball, there are\nstandards, given by the rules of baseball, to which a home run has to\nlive up. A practice also introduces reasons which are internal to it;\nthese reasons may be means-end or calculative reasons (as when the\nrules specify the object of the game: in baseball, as Yogi Berra\nfamously put it, to win, by scoring more points than the opposing\nteam), or reasons of other kinds. (In squash, that the other player\u2019s\nhead is between your racquet and the ball is a reason to call a\n\u2018let\u2019, but not because it is the best way to win; if you\nwere to exercise your option of hitting your opponent in the head, you\nwould win the point. In squash, calculative reasons are modulated by\ngentlemanly reasons.)\n\nTamar Schapiro has extended Rawls\u2019s treatment, developing it into a\ntheory of action (Schapiro 2001; she attributes the view to Kant, but\nagain the historical question will not be taken up). On her view,\n\u2018actions\u2019 are just moves in the completely generic\npractice; that is, \u2018action\u2019 is a status within the generic\npractice in something like the way that \u2018move\u2019 is a status\nwithin chess. Schapiro does not name the generic practice, but because\nit will be convenient to have a short way of referring to it, let\u2019s\ncall it \u2018Intendo\u2019. Intendo is the game you are playing\nwhenever you do anything at all; \u2018agent\u2019 is thus the\ngeneric role in the generic game (the analog of \u2018player,\u2019\nin chess or baseball). Practices specify standards and reasons, and so\n\u2018practical reason\u2019 turns out to be a practice status as\nwell. Intendo consequently determines what forms practical reasons can\ntake, and so patterns of practical inference are to be read off of\nwhat turns out to be the theory of action.\n\nPractical reasons are practical only if they could be brought\nto bear on some decision resulting in action; being an action is a\nstatus (the generic move) within Intendo; so there could be no\npractical reasons coming from outside the practice of Intendo. (Other,\nmore local practices have to accommodate reasons that come from\noutside the practice; for instance, in chess, the object of the game\nis to win, but I may have personal reasons for not playing to win.)\nTherefore, if you can show that Intendo imposes some standard on its\nreasons (for instance, and to anticipate, that they have to be\nuniversalizable), then you will have shown that all reasons have to\nmeet it.\n\nAn important metaethical question about practical reasoning has to do\nwith the modality (roughly, the force) of the family of operators that\nincludes \u2018may\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, \u2018should\u2019,\nand so on, when what is at issue is what you have reason to do. (Call\nthis the \u2018modality of freedom\u2019.) Schapiro\u2019s approach\nprovides a surprising answer to this question: the modality of freedom\nis that of the \u2018can\u2019 in \u2018Can he do\nthat?\u2019 \u2013 said of someone who has just run the bases\nbackwards. Freedom of the will ranges over the allowable moves in the\ngame of Intendo.\n\nIn extending Rawls\u2019s view, Schapiro has departed from it in some ways.\nRawls thought that \u2018relatively few actions of the moral life are\ndefined by practices\u2019 (op. cit., 32n), and worried about the\nconservatism implicit in taking \u2018the social practices of [each\nperson\u2019s] society to provide the standard of justification for his\nactions\u2019 (32). On Schapiro\u2019s view, being an action tout\ncourt is a status in Intendo, and being a reason is a status in\nIntendo. Rawls objected to the \u2018summary\u2019 conception of\nrules characteristic of utilitarianism, that it allowed only\n\u2018one office and so no offices at all\u2019 (28). But in\nIntendo, the sole office or role is that of \u2018agent\u2019. Rawls took it\nto be \u2018essential to the notion of a practice that the rules are\npublicly known and understood as definitive\u2019 (24). This cannot\nbe true of Intendo; if what reasons for action could be was public\nknowledge, and understood as definitive, there would not be a cottage\nindustry of philosophers arguing about the forms of practical\nreasoning. And finally, the Wittgensteinian roots of Rawls\u2019s treatment\nsuggest that he would have been skeptical of a strategy that turned on\nfinding the deepest common features of all practices. The notion of a\npractice, again, is an extension of the notion of a game, and\nWittgenstein famously pointed out that there is no nontrivial feature\ncommon to all games (see Section 3.4, on language games, in the entry\non\n Ludwig Wittgenstein).\n However, to point out that Schapiro\u2019s position differs from Rawls\u2019s\nis of course not thereby to criticize it; rather, it is to warn\nagainst too quickly assuming her position to inherit all of the\nstructural features of the older and more familiar one.\n\nSchapiro\u2019s article eyes a finish line that is some version of Kantian\nmorality. She writes that \u2018if it is right to think of universal\nlaws on the model of practice rules, then the law of freedom can be\nthought of as an indeterminate practice rule, one which simply\nrequires us to make every movement as if it were to count as a move in\nsome possible global practice\u2019 (108); this is a paraphrase, in\nthe vocabulary of this theory, of the Kantian demand that one act only\non maxims of which one could will that they be universal laws. The\npatterns of practical reasoning are to be those acknowledged by\nKantian theory of practical rationality, and the substantive moral\nconsequences, those endorsed by Kantian moral theory.\n\nSchapiro\u2019s position is motivated in the first place by the history of\naction theory. She identifies two older conceptions of action, a\nconsequence-oriented view, on which actions are simply ways of\nproducing effects in a given, natural world, and an expressivist view,\non which actions function more or less as evaluative pronouncements.\nThe practice view of action is meant to capture the truth in each of\nthese, while avoiding their defects; it is, as it were, their Hegelian\nsynthesis. But Schapiro is also motivated by an appreciation of the\nimportance and value to us of a world enriched by practice statuses.\nIt is not just that the predecessor theories are wrong about what an\naction is; it is that forgoing the textured world created by our\npractices would be a terrible mistake. Korsgaard, we saw, developed\nher action-theoretic account of practical rationality\npsychologistically, and one might have jumped to the conclusion that\npsychologism was a deep feature of the Kantian position. However,\nwhile Schapiro\u2019s position is not motivated by\nanti-psychologism, it is nonetheless non-psychologistic. When you\nassess the reasons a practice generates, you can leave the psychology\nof the players out of it. For instance, when the king is in check,\nthen the chess player has a reason to move it out of check; you don\u2019t\nlook inside anyone\u2019s head, as it were, to determine that, but rather,\nat the constitutive rules of chess.\n\nAs before, if the Kantian moral conclusions are to be binding, then\nnot only must the practice conception entail the Kantian conclusions,\nbut the practice conception of action must be shown to be nonoptional.\nThe game of baseball gives its players reasons, but you can always\nchoose not to play in the first place, and you can choose to stop\nplaying; what\u2019s more, the rules of baseball themselves bring baseball\ngames to a close. In either case, the reasons of baseball do not\n\u2013 or cease to \u2013 apply to you. Intendo must therefore be a\ngame that you cannot walk away from. But why can\u2019t you simply stop\nplaying Intendo, and start producing \u2013 not perhaps\n\u2018actions\u2019, but activity of some other kind \u2013 that is\nnot practice-governed? We have already gestured at one answer: the\nimportance of living in a practice-informed world. One further answer\nSchapiro might give is that you can\u2019t do that \u2013 where\nthe modality of the \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 is the modality of freedom.\n(Since reasons are a practice status, questions having to do with\npractical reason do not arise for the alternative forms of activity.)\n\n\nThe question is especially pressing in view of a further philosophical\nmotivation for Schapiro\u2019s project. Non-ideal theory is concerned with\nguidelines for action and moral thinking in a world that is not very\nmoral at all, and Schapiro 2006 takes up a traditional Kantian test\ncase, that of the murderer at the door. Kantian moral theory prohibits\nlying, and in a world in which there were no murderers, perhaps that\nwould be fine; but here he is, asking if his intended victim, to whom\nyou have just served a cup of tea, is at home. The casuistical\nexercise is that of providing an explanation, consistent with the\nmoral theory, of the legitimacy of lying to him, and Schapiro\u2019s\nsolution draws on the idea that moral reasons, like all reasons for\naction, are statuses in the game of Intendo. If the murderer at the\ndoor is refusing to play the game, then your own moves cannot be\nresponses to his moves in the game. In this case, honesty meant as a\ncontribution to the \u2018co-legislation game\u2019 (the game that\nproperly played Intendo turns out to be) is simply not an option. And\nif proper honesty is not an available move, perhaps other moves are\navailable to you.\n\nThe tension is this: On the one hand, you must act out of the moral\nlaw because you cannot opt out of the game of Intendo; that is why\nmorality is binding. On the other hand, however, you may lie to the\nmurderer at the door, because he has opted out of the game of\nIntendo. Schapiro provides a label for what she intends as a way of\nsplitting the difference: the murderer is betraying the\ngeneric practice without opting out of it. But the\ndistinction marked by the label is as yet unexplained. The further\ndevelopment of the practice view will be shaped by the need to\naccommodate these apparently conflicting theoretical constraints.\n5. Evaluation as Essential to Action\n\nWe will review two variants of the thesis that evaluation is\nan essential feature of action, or of a privileged kind of action,\ndue, respectively, to Sarah Buss and Talbot Brewer.\n\nBuss distinguishes between mere \u201cmovements of the human\nbody\u201d and full fledged intentional action by requiring, for the\nlatter, that agents endorse their actions at the time they are\ninitiated; the content of the endorsement must in one way or another\ncome to allowing the agent\u2019s reasons to be sufficient for performing\nthe action (Buss 1999). Anything short of that, she argues, amounts to\nadopting a spectatorial stance towards your own actions: if you\nidentify a number of desires, notice that you could satisfy them by\nperforming an action, but then don\u2019t arrive at an evaluative belief\nwith roughly the content that that\u2019s good enough to go ahead, you will\nbe doing no more than sitting back to see what happens \u2013 to see\nwhether the desires actuate your body. \n\nBuss then considers a Humean moral psychology on which reasons for\naction are drawn from two mutually exclusive classes of psychological\nstates, desires and beliefs, where beliefs are understood to have no\nproperly evaluative content (e.g., Smith, 1987). Since such a moral\npsychology has no room for evaluative beliefs, and since intentional\naction requires one particular sort of evaluative belief, Humean moral\npsychology is, she concludes, incompatible with there being\nintentional actions. It evidently follows that a theory of practical\nreasoning which presupposes Humean moral psychology cannot allow for\nintentional action, either. (There is a little bit of slippage here:\none might allow for the evaluations, but then insist that these could\nnot figure into practical reasoning. But this would be an awkward way\nof resisting the conclusion.) Theories of practical reasoning which\nidentify reasons for action solely with desires and beliefs so\ncharacterized \u2013 so-called Humean theories \u2013 are directed\ntowards choosing actions, yet incompatible with actions being chosen.\nThe conclusion we are invited to draw is that Humean theories of\npractical reasoning are incoherent. A dramatic way of putting it might\nbe: if your will is to be free, instrumentalism must be false.\n\nThere is evident overlap between Buss\u2019s view and Velleman\u2019s: both\npivot on the concern that one act for one\u2019s (sufficient or good enough\nor best) reasons. (In Velleman, that concern appears as a desire,\nwhere in Buss, it appears as an evaluation.) But the concern is\ndifferently motivated: where Velleman is trying to halt a regress in\nthe structural analysis of agency, Buss is trying to express the\nphilosophical thought that action is active rather than passive. Once\npast the conclusion that a theory of practical rationality had better\nnot presuppose a Humean theory of motivation, Buss is open-minded both\nabout what one\u2019s practical reasons might turn out to be like, and thus\nabout the consequences for moral theory. And worries about\npsychologism do not seem to figure into her view.\n\nTurning now to Brewer, we encounter a shift of key.  In the contrasts\nbetween full-fledged and lower-grade doings that we have reviewed so\nfar, \u201caction \u201d was used to designate the first-class\nversion, and often \u201cactivity \u201d labeled its lesser\nrelative.  In Brewer\u2019s terminology,\ndialectical activity is the privileged category, and actions\nmake up the inferior contrasting class.  Actions are merely structured\nto produce a \u201cpre-envisioned state of affairs\u201d.  But\ndialectical activity is marked out by two features.  First, coming to\nunderstand better what the activity is counts as an essential aspect\nof the activity itself.  And second, continually arriving at a deeper\nunderstanding of the good of the activity also is an essential aspect\nof such an activity (Brewer 2009, 55 and passim).  For\ninstance, one might well think that part of what it is to be in a\nhealthy and satisfactory friendship is to be developing a\nprogressively deeper sense of what this particular friendship is\nabout, of why and how it is rewarding, and of what challenges it poses\nand how to navigate them.  Moreover, it is also to be developing a\ngradually improving understanding of the demands, rewards, promise and\nsignificance of friendship generally.  (The view is positioned as\nrecovering insights from older ethics, with pride of place to\nAristotle, but as before, here we will not take up the historical\nquestion.) \n\nAs we will shortly see, the anchor for the view is not that of our\npreviously surveyed positions, that to do is thereby to act, period.\n(And so Brewer\u2019s view is perhaps a penumbral member of this family of\npositions.)  Rather, firstly, mere actions typically will not make\nsense outside the context of a dialectical activity, and secondly,\nBrewer advances but does not quite directly argue for the suggestion\nthat dialectical activities make up everything that could count as\nintrinsically valuable for human beings.  Anything that is worthwhile\non its own \u2013 anyway, worthwhile enough to be taken seriously as\nsomething one would try to fold into one\u2019s life, from\nconversation to friendship to philosophy \u2013 belongs in this\ncategory.\n\n\nBecause the proposal is likely to bring to mind specificationist\nclaims about practical reasoning, some compare and contrast is in\norder.  Specificationism is built around the observation that,\nfrequently enough, one\u2019s ends are not concrete or definite\nenough to launch questions about how to attain them; first, the\ncontent of one\u2019s goals must be filled in and firmed up enough\nfor that to be possible.  For instance, and borrowing a low-key\nexample from Bernard Williams (1981a, 104), if our objective is to be\nentertained this evening, and so far that\u2019s all we have settled,\nwe have to decide what sort of entertainment it will be, before we can\nconsider steps we might take.  Therefore, there must be a mode of\npractical thinking that does that job.  (For an overview of the\nspecificationist back and forth, see Millgram, 2008.)  But where the\naim of specificationist deliberation is to arrive at a sufficiently\nconcrete rendering of an objective, at which point it ceases, and\ncalculatively structured action, more or less as we saw it rendered by\nVogler, resumes, in dialectical activity, the clarification of the\nactivity and of how it is desirable is ongoing, rather than a\npreliminary.  You find out what the rewards of this friendship are by\nparticipating in it, and the longer you are someone\u2019s friend,\nthe more nuanced and the deeper your appreciation of what it brings to\nyour life becomes.  When it\u2019s just an evening\u2019s\nentertainment, figuring out what we want it to be doesn\u2019t\nusually turn up as part of entertaining ourselves; in the activities\nthat constitute friendship, however, it is grounds for complaint when\none of the participants ceases paying attention to the emerging shape\nof the friendship itself.  The deliberative baton is not simply handed\nover to means-end reasoning; rather, although one is moved to one\nafter another after another goal-directed action, those actions are\nthemselves part and parcel of further comprehending just what the\ndialectical activity in which they arise is.\n\nAdapting one of Brewer\u2019s illustrations, two friends may be on a\nmotorcycle on their way to Vegas, for blackjack and wild times; when\nwe check back, a few years later, we find them in the gardening aisle\nat Home Depot; a few years after that, doing something very different\nfrom either of those things.  There\u2019s an observation we can\nextract, about the relation between activities and actions as other\nviews we have surveyed conceive them: on the one hand, the activity of\nfriendship produces an endless stream of subsidiary goals and actions\n(those roadtrips, gardening projects and so on); on the other, because\nthe participants\u2019 conception of the friendship will continue to\ndeepen and shift, the actions in that stream cannot be concretely\ncharacterized up front.  The versions of high-grade and low-grade\naction being contrasted with each other here are interdependent.\nDialectical activity normally emits merely end-directed action on an\nongoing basis.  (And the intelligibility of those ends normally\ndepends on their embedding within dialectical activity, if only the\nactivity of living one\u2019s life; it makes sense that they\u2019d\nbe biking to Vegas, given how, at that stage of the friendship, they\nunderstand what their friendship is about, and without that context,\nit wouldn\u2019t make much sense.)  Conversely, the improving grasp\nof what one is doing, central to the activity, depends on the friction\nwith the surrounding circumstances produced by the end-directed\nactions; it was, perhaps, the way the Vegas trip didn\u2019t work\nout, and the subsequent quarrel, that made the two of them rethink\nwhat they were doing with each other, and start in on the\ngardening.\n\nOn the views against which Brewer is positioning his own, actions are\nmotivated by desires, which are propositional attitudes: that is,\ncentrally, descriptions of states of affairs that might be realized in\nthe future, and in light of which you effect and adjust what you can\nand are willing to, so as to make the description true.  (Brewer\nattempts to reappropriate the concept of desire for his own purposes,\nbut I won\u2019t spell that move out here.)  However, what you\nare moved \u2013 as opposed to \u2018motivated\u2019\n\u2013 by, in the course of a dialectical activity, cannot be\ncaptured by a proposition.  For one thing, a proposition has a\ndefinite, stable content; propositions are sometimes thought of as\npartitioning all the possible worlds \u2013 the ways things might be\nor might have been \u2013 into those that are, intuitively,\ncompatible with it, and those that are not; the proposition effects\nits partition once and for all.  But the content of what\nmoves you, in the course of dialectical activity, is deepening and\nevolving, and there is no point at which apprehending it is properly\nover.  So no proposition could successfully demarcate what it is the\nactivity is after and about.\n\nMoreover, desires as nowadays standardly conceived set a proposition\nas to be made true at some point in the future.  But the object of\ndialectical activity does not lie in the future: living your life is a\ndialectical activity, and you are already living; your life\ndoes not wait to be lived until it is over.  If you are\nsomebody\u2019s friend, you are already participating, you\nhope successfully, in the friendship.  If you are philosophizing in an\nappropriately philosophical frame of mind (and so, always striving\nbetter to understand what philosophy is), you are\nalready philosophizing.  So although the many simpler\nsubsidiary actions that are constantly being spun off by dialectical\nactivities can often be thought of as controlled by this sort of\npropositional attitude, dialectical activity cannot itself be\nconstrued as desire-driven, in this standard sense of\n\u2018desire\u2019.\n\nWhat is at stake in the disagreement over how to conceptualize these\nongoing courses of action?  In the example we\u2019re using, the\nfriends\u2019 goals change dramatically from time to time; seen\nthrough the lens of rationalization-by-desires, as standardly\nconceived, the segments of the friendship are only collected into a\ndeveloping trajectory retrospectively.  The cost is not just that one\nmisses seeing what unifies the activity while it is in progress; often\nenough, the inability to understand the activity as unified, despite\nthe very different appearances of its segments, undercuts its unity.\n(Not always: Brewer adduces Augustine as an example of someone who did\nnot understand his life as a search for God until late on, even though\nthat is what it was and had been all along.)  But then, one does not\nhave that dialectical activity \u2013 here, a friendship,\nwhose parties are jointly pressing towards a more truthful, more\nworkable, or otherwise better understanding of what that friendship\nis.  That means that operating only on the basis of\nrationalization-by-desires condemns one to life largely empty of the\ngoods that really matter \u2013 for instance, friendships.  To be\nsure, whether this is the cost of surrendering dialectical activities\nas Brewer describes them will depend on whether he is substantively\ncharacterizing those central human goods correctly; an opponent will\npresumably contest the view on those grounds.\n\nReturning to the point of convergence with older specificationism, if\nthe evolving conception of a dialectical activity and what makes it\ndesirable is deliberative rather than arational, there must be\nreasons, and reasoning, that can modify not only one\u2019s decisions\nabout how to attain what one already straightforwardly wants, but also\none\u2019s view of what one is after.  That is, in the jargon, over\nand above instrumental rationality, deliberation of ends must be\npossible.  And that returns us to the question of the conception of\nreasons tied to this contrast between dialectical activity and mere\nactions.  Per the spirit of Brewer\u2019s view, it shouldn\u2019t be\npossible simply to spell out what practical reasoning correctly\nperformed must amount to; since practical reasoning is an aspect of\nmost or all dialectical activity, our grasp of what practical\nreasoning is will continue to develop alongside our grasp of such\nactivities.  Nonetheless, a number of upshots for practical\nrationality stand out in Brewer\u2019s discussion.\n\nFirst, against the often implicitly accepted model of practical\nreasoning as a matter of first surveying surrounding circumstances,\nthen assessing them, and then deciding what new action to initiate\nnext, one largely attends to what one is already in the middle of\ndoing, clarifying how it has gone hitherto, with an eye to a\ncontinuation.  The action does not commence only after the survey and\nassessment, and consequently the primary object of attention turns out\nto be the action already in progress.  Here the model is an author\nrereading his half-written book or paper, wondering how to complete\nhis not-fully-formed train of thought \u2013 the train of thought he\nis in the middle of, rather than about to kick off \u2013 or perhaps\nthat author reviewing his rough drafts.  Because understanding of what\none is doing does not come all at once but gradually, as one proceeds\nwith one\u2019s course of action, the ability to survey and assess\nall the considerations relevant to a decision up front, as presupposed\nby the competing model, will not normally be in place when anything\nthat is itself significant is at stake.\n\nSecond, the question one finds oneself asking amounts to,\n\u2018What have I been doing?,\u2019 and those\ncharacterizations of what one is doing that drive further choice will\nbe largely framed using thick ethical concepts.  That is, rather than\napplying concepts like \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 to\nevaluatively neutral descriptions of one\u2019s circumstances or\nactivity, they will deploy descriptions whose very application depends\non mobilizing one\u2019s evaluative capacities.  (E.g., in the\nelaborate case study which led Bernard Williams to identify this class\nof concepts, there isn\u2019t any way to mark out what counts as\nobscene, if one occupies only the evaluatively neutral view of a\nMartian exobiologist; Williams 1981b, and for background, see the\nentry on\nthick ethical concepts.)\nWilliams controversially claimed that thick ethical concepts could not\nbe factored into strictly factual and strictly evaluative components\n(for an overview, see Millgram 1995).  Brewer argues that the unity\nover time of dialectical activities supports Williams\u2019s view on\nthis point, and in addition, that our need to rely on thick ethical\nconcepts undercuts the distinction we have used in framing this very\nsurvey, between theoretical and practical reasons \u2013 that is,\nrespectively, reasons that figure into argument as to how the facts\nstand, and those that figure into arguments for doing one thing or\nanother.\n\nAnd third and finally for now, certain of our qualms about delegating\nour practical reasoning to others are accounted for. If practical\nthought is, as Brewer puts it, \u2018a seamless part of the\nactivity\u2019 of, say, friendship, or conducting a conversation, or\nmaking one\u2019s way through philosophy, or just living one\u2019s\nlife, then to contract out one\u2019s deliberation and decisions to\nthird parties \u2013 even expert third parties \u2013 is to forego\nthe valuable activity itself.\n\nAlthough both Buss and Brewer highlight the role of evaluation in\naction, for Buss, the evaluation that matters is the settled output of\none\u2019s evaluating; for Brewer, the evaluation that matters is the\nevaluating.\n6. Prospects and Outstanding Issues\n\nThe turn to action theory is producing some of the most interesting\nrecent work on practical reasoning. As we have seen, however, their\nshared methodology notwithstanding, these theorists disagree on just\nabout everything else: on their philosophical reasons for adopting the\napproach in the first place, on what the correct theory of practical\nreasoning is, on why one form or another of practical inference is\nnonoptional or binding, and on what the upshots are for morality or\nethics. However, as awareness of the shared agenda grows, we are\nstarting to see positions that attempt to take on board elements from\nmore than one of the theories currently in play and, in addition, take\nup the task of explaining why competitors are misguided.\n\nThe primary source of the disagreements just mentioned is a further\ndisagreement, as to what it takes to count as an action. On\none view, intentional actions are centrally characterized by their\nstepwise or nested internal structure; on another, by their being\nauthored or owned; on the third, by their location in a practice; on a\nfourth, by entailing an evaluation of one\u2019s reasons.  (In one\nvariant, we saw, those evaluations are entailed by \u2018dialectical\nactivity\u2019, contrasted with mere action, and characterized by\nongoing reconsideration of its point and nature.)  As we have seen,\nsome of these characterizations come with supporting arguments, and\nthis is a dramatic advance on the state of play as of about two\ndecades back; however, the norm in this subfield is still to omit\nexplanations of why arguments for competing conceptions of action are\nincorrect. In a famous essay that kicked off discussion of a different\ntopic in practical reasoning, Robert Nozick observed that advocates of\nthe alternative responses to Newcomb\u2019s Problem were prepared to\nexplain why they thought their own position correct, but not what was\nwrong with arguments for the other alternative; such a posture is\nunsatisfactory, and Nozick emphasized that in such debates \u2018it\nwill not do to rest content with one\u2019s belief ... nor will it do\nto just repeat one of the arguments, loudly and slowly\u2019 (Nozick\n1997, p. 48).\n\nIt follows that the most important item on the agenda of this research\nprogram is to produce arguments that will decide between the competing\nconceptions of action in play. One can\u2019t very well hang one\u2019s theory\nof practical reasoning, and one\u2019s moral theory to boot, off an account\nof action that is treated as obviously false by other researchers in\none\u2019s discipline, when one has no story to tell about why one\u2019s own\naccount is correct, and theirs is not. We may conclude by observing\nthat there are two modes of argument one must choose between. One\nmight try to establish that, as a matter of metaphysical fact, actions\nare as this or that theory says; alternatively, one might\nargue that one is to (ought to, had better) produce actions\nwhich are as the theory says; that is, the top-level argumentation\nmight be either theoretical or practical. \n\nThe choice between the two modes of argument is tied to a further\nstrategic choice. On the approach we are examining, theories of\npractical inference inherit their bindingness from the non-optionality\nof the associated conception of action. That entails that any such\ntheory needs an answer to the question, \u2018Given what is meant by\n\u201caction\u201d, why not produce activity of some other\nkind?\u2019 To quickly canvass the forms this question takes for the\ntheories we have on the table: Why shouldn\u2019t I look for noncalculative\ncontrol structures, and manage my activity by using them?\nWhat\u2019s wrong with answering the question, \u2018Did you really\ndo (i.e., author) that?\u2019 with, \u2018Well, no, it just\nkind of happened?\u2019 What\u2019s wrong with engaging in activities that\ncompete with each other or frustrate themselves \u2013 that is, with\nbehaving as though you were a market on the inside, rather than a\ntotalitarian state? Why shouldn\u2019t I opt out of the game of Intendo, in\nsomething like the way I might decline a round of pinochle? (And if\nit\u2019s simply not possible, how is it that I have to cope with people\nwho seem to have opted out themselves?) Why bother with evaluating the\nreasons for my action? Isn\u2019t the fact that I am responsive to them\nenough?   Why not detour around activities with the structure\nof friendship, philosophizing, and conversation?   Isn\u2019t, say, harvesting\nan ongoing stream of sensual pleasures quite enough?\nNotice that we should not assume without argument that one or\nanother mode of action must be nonoptional; if the pressures toward\none or another form of action amount to less than practical necessity,\npluralism about action might be the appropriate conclusion (Millgram\n2010). \n\nA theoretical answer would involve showing that there is nothing else\nthat you can \u2013 metaphysically \u2013 do: that whatever\nyou do (in the thinnest possible sense) is action (in the theory\u2019s\nthicker and more substantive sense). A practical answer would involve\nshowing that, given the alternatives, the suggestion that you produce\nactions (in the substantive sense of one\u2019s favored theory) is, as they\nused to say, an offer you can\u2019t refuse. The type of force or\nbindingness that one\u2019s theory of practical reason will inherit from\none\u2019s theory of action will be determined by the choice between these\ntwo modes of argument.\n",
