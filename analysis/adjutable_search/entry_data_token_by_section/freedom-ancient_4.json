    "main_text": "Fatalism, Bivalence, and Determinism || The Stoics on the fatalist argument and co-fated events\n1.4 The Stoics on the fatalist argument and co-fated events\n\nEpicurus believes that both the Principle of Bivalence and causal\ndeterminism are false; the Stoics believe that both are true, and that\ntheir truth does not render us powerless or make what will happen\ninevitable. In fact, the Stoics think that every event is both\ncausally determined and fated. The Stoics believe that God is wise,\ngood, perfectly happy, and creator of the world (DL 7.147, LS\n54A). But God is not an immaterial entity separate from the world who\ncreated it ex nihilo\u2014instead, god is the\nworld. and his mind pervades and organizes all things (Cicero, On\nthe Nature of the Gods 1.39, LS 54B; Alexander, On\nMixture 225, 1\u20132, LS 54H). Because God is good, he wishes to\nbenefit everything (Clement, The teacher 1.8.63 1\u20132, LS 60I).\nSo God\u2019s providential will is to make the world the best he can.\nGod is extremely powerful but not omnipotent, as he works within the\nlimits of what is physically possible, like a craftsman skillfully\nbuilding something with the materials at hand. The way God realizes\nhis providential will is through setting up the causal order of the\nworld to bring it about. Fate is an everlasting \u201cordering and\nsequence of causes\u201d which brings about every single thing that\nhas happened, is happening, and is going to happen. This is \u201cnot\nthe \u2018fate\u2019 of superstition, but that of physics\u201d\n(Cicero, On Divination 1.125\u20136, LS 55L). So for example, if\nGod has it as part of his providential plan that I will recover from\ncancer, God will fate my recovery by building that future event into\nthe overall organization of the cosmos from its foundation, so that\nthe fated recovery will necessarily arise as the series of causes\nunspools itself over time.\n\nThe Stoics believe that having everything that occurs fated in this\nway is compatible with our deliberating and acting effectively. To see\nthis, consider the following example. Suppose that I am a Stoic, and I\ncontract cancer. As a Stoic, I realize that it has been true from\neternity and fated either that I will recover from the cancer, or that\nI will not. But that does not render the outcome of my cancer\ninevitable or make it pointless for me to seek treatment. The Stoic\nChrysippus says that certain outcomes are simple, while\nothers are conjoined. Simple outcomes are ones that will occur no\nmatter what I do. For instance, as a mortal being, that I will die is\ninevitable; it will happen no matter what I\n do.[2]\n In the case of such simple outcomes, deliberation and action would be\npointless. However, other things are conjoined, where an outcome is\nlinked to its cause, which is necessary for it to occur. For instance,\nif Oedipus is going to be born of Laius, that is conjoined with Laius\nand Jocasta having intercourse. In the case of my fated recovery from\ncancer, that fated recovery is conjoined to my action of seeking\ntreatment, and Chrysippus says that the two are\n\u201cco-fated\u201d: it is fated (and causally determined)\nboth that I will recover from the cancer and that I\nwill seek treatment; it is through my fated action of seeking\ntreatment that my fated recovery will occur (Fat. 30, LS\n55S). Since my action of seeking treatment is causally efficacious in\nbringing about its purpose, it isn\u2019t pointless. My action is\nitself both causally determined and causally efficacious. Furthermore,\neven if it\u2019s causally determined that I\u2019ll recover,\ncounterfactuals like \u201cif I don\u2019t seek treatment, I will\ndie\u201d can still be true. As Chrysippus puts it, even if\nit\u2019s true (and causally determined) that somebody will wrestle,\nit doesn\u2019t follow that they\u2019ll wrestle whether or not they\nhave an opponent, and even if it\u2019s true (and causally determined)\nthat somebody will recover from a disease, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat they\u2019ll recover whether or not they call a doctor\n(Fat. 30, LS 55S).\n\nThe Stoics say that actions like my seeking treatment for cancer,\nwhich are brought about by fate through the animal,\nare \u201cin the power\u201d of the animal, but they deny that we\nare free to choose between opposite actions\u2014seeking\ntreatment or not seeking treatment (Alexander, On Fate ch 13,\n181,13\u2013182,20, LS 62G). The Stoics believe Carneades is wrong to think\nthat we need such a power to choose between opposite actions in order\nto stave off the fatalist argument and avoid its conclusion that the\nfuture is inevitable and we are powerless to do anything to shape it.\nEven if my action of seeking treatment is causally determined, and I\ndo not have the ability not to seek treatment, seeking treatment can\nstill lead to the cure of my cancer, a cure that would not have\nhappened if I had not sought treatment. Like Aristotle, who was not\nwilling to give up the idea that we effectively deliberate about our\nactions, the Stoics posit that I can effectively and rationally\ndeliberate about what to do, even if the outcome of my deliberation\nand the actions that result from it are both causally determined. If I\nam in an unclear situation, considering the pros and cons of various\nactions is rational and will likely lead to a better decision than\nacting impulsively. Consider an example where I am offered a job, and\nI think things through before deciding to accept it. I had to go\nthrough the process of deliberation to reach that fated outcome;\nit\u2019s no more true that I would have accepted the job whether or\nnot I deliberated about the offer than it is that I would have\nrecovered from cancer whether or not I sought treatment. So in the\noriginal fatalist argument, the Stoics would reject the premise that\nif it is true from eternity that an event will occur, then that event\nis necessary, in the sense of inevitable or beyond our power to\neffect, and they also reject Carneades\u2019 assertion that events\nthat have been causally determined from eternity are necessary in that\nsense.\n\nZeno, the founder of Stoicism, and Chrysippus were each said to\ncompare the relationship of humans and fate to that of a dog tied to a\ncart: \n\n\nWhen a dog is tied to a cart, if it wants to follow it is pulled and\nfollows, making its spontaneous act coincide with necessity, but if it\ndoes not want to follow it will be compelled in any case. So it is\nwith men too: even if they do not want to, they will be compelled in\nany case to follow what is destined. (Hippolytus, Refutation of\nall heresies 1.21, LS 62A) \n\n\nThis analogy suggests that god has preordained certain outcomes that\nwill happen no matter what decisions people make, with our decisions\naffecting only the manner in which this fated outcome occurs.\nGod will bypass and override any efforts to defy him. (Perhaps if I\nirrationally decide not to seek treatment for my cancer, god\nimplements a contingency plan that ensures my fated recovery, albeit\nin a way that involves far more trouble and pain for me.)\n\nBut at least as deployed by Chrysippus, the above interpretation of\nthe dog and cart analogy is probably incorrect. If certain outcomes\nwere fated to occur no matter what we were to decide or to do, that\nwould seem to make deliberation and action futile, whereas Chrysippus\nwishes to assert that our actions do have an impact on what occurs,\nwith god bringing about the fated outcome through our fated action.\nInstead, Chrysippus is probably making the more general point that it\nis impossible to resist god\u2019s providential plan and the edicts\nof fate, and that trying to do so is a bad idea. That is because\ngod\u2019s providential plan encompasses everything whatsoever that\noccurs in the cosmos, which would include even vicious actions and\nattempts to defy god (Plutarch, On Stoic Self-Contradiction\n1050c-d, LS 54T). The Stoics also share the Greek ethical commonplace\nthat vice is a kind is psychic disharmony and disorder that causes\nagitation and distress (Cicero, Tusculan disputations 4.29,\n34\u20135, LS 61O). Furthermore, the wise person willingly submits themself\nto god\u2019s will\u2014they wish for things to happen as they do\nhappen, which is the same as wishing for them to happen as god wills them\nto happen. Such submission brings happiness (Epictetus,\nHandbook 8; Seneca, On Benefits 4.34.4). And so, a\nvicious person who tries to defy the will of god fails in their plan, as\neven their attempted defiance has been fated by god, but through their\nfoolish actions they do \u201csucceed\u201d in bringing about their\nown misery, just like the dog being dragged along the path.\n",
