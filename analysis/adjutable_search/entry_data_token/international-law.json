But\nphilosophical engagement with international legal themes stretches\nback to writings on natural law in ancient Greece and Rome.\nPhilosophers in this tradition\u2014such as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,\nand the Stoics\u2014advanced the idea of a universal normative order\nover and above the laws and customs found in particular societies that\nis discoverable through the exercise of ordinary human, or\n\u201cnatural\u201d, reason (Nussbaum 2019: 18\u201396). In the\nMiddle Ages, Christian beliefs framed the idea of normative\nuniversalism which, at times, was cynically deployed to justify the\nwrongs of Christian rulers but, at its best, provided the basis for\nsubjecting their conduct to moral censure, as the criticisms of the\nConquistadores in some of the Spanish Scholastics illustrate\n(Pagden 2003; Pagden & Lawrence 1991).\n\nIn the modern era, the Dutch natural lawyer Hugo Grotius is credited\nwith laying the foundations for the rise of international law as a\ngenuine system of positive law, rather than simply a source of\nuniversal moral or \u201cnatural law\u201d principles. By insisting\nthat his system of law would be justifiable even if it were assumed\nthat God does not exist, i.e., the \u201cetiamsi\ndaremus\u201d argument in the Prolegomena to his De Jure\nBelli ac Pacis (1625: para. XI), Grotius paved the way for a more\ngenuinely universalist conception of international law, independent of\nChristian beliefs and thus more ideologically inclusive (Nussbaum\n2019: 97\u2013140). Subsequently, important contributions were made\nby other major philosophers, including Pufendorf, Kant, Hegel,\nBentham. Although the two leading legal philosophers of the twentieth\ncentury\u2014Hans Kelsen and H.L.A. Hart\u2014devoted attention to\ninternational law, and extensively so in the case of the former\n(Bernstorff 2010), international law was neglected by the Anglophone\nlegal and political philosophers who followed them, and important\nworks by international law scholars with potential significance to\nphilosophical debate\u2014e.g., Brierly (1928) or Lauterpacht\n(1933)\u2014seldom resonated outside the field of international law.\nBy the end of the last century, however, there was a surge in\nphilosophical engagement with international law. This change is\nreflected in the publication of The Law of Peoples, the last\nbook written by John Rawls (1999), and also in the more\nphilosophically inclined works of prominent international lawyers,\nsuch as Thomas Franck (1995).\n\nThe focus of this entry is on developments that have occurred since\nWorld War II. In the aftermath of World War II, an unprecedentedly\nsophisticated international architecture of legal norms and\ninstitutions, to a large extent associated with the United Nations\nsystem, was established. With the end of the Cold War, and the spread\nof globalization, this architecture reached new heights of ambition,\nclaiming authority over a diverse range of governmental matters that\nwere formerly treated as falling within the exclusive province of\nstate authority. The scope of international law expanded to cover new\nsubject-matter, such as the relationship between the individual and\nthe State, migration, or the environment. Many now perceive the\n\u201cinternational rule-based order\u201d to be imperilled by the\nrise of authoritarian powers, on the one hand, and of populist forces\nin the Western world, on the other; both are said to be hostile to\ninternational law, especially to certain aspects of it like human\nrights (Alston 2017; Ginsburg 2020; Neuman 2020; Wuerth 2017). For\nothers, the expansion of international law poses a challenge to the\nliberal foundations of domestic sovereignty. This entry is inevitably\nselective, focusing on some general conceptual and normative\nquestions, but discussions of the discrete domains of international\nlaw can be found elsewhere in the Stanford Encyclopedia (see e.g., the\nentry on\n human rights).\n", "toc": [{"#ConcNormArguInteLaw": "1.

Conceptual and Normative Argument on International Law\n\nRecent philosophy of international law has pursued a great variety of\nquestions. For present purposes, they can be broadly grouped into two\ncategories, although the boundaries between them are not sharp. First,\nthere are conceptual questions, such as whether international law is\ngenuinely an instance of \u201claw\u201d and, if it is, how it is\nrelated to the municipal legal orders associated with individual\nstates; there are also conceptual questions relating to key ideas\nemployed in international legal discourse, whether these be general\nideas such as \u201csovereignty\u201d, \u201cthe state\u201d, or\n\u201clegitimacy\u201d, or ideas associated with specific\ninternational legal sources or doctrines, such as \u201ccustomary\ninternational law\u201d, \u201cjus cogens\u201d, and\n\u201chuman rights\u201d. Such questions are discussed mainly in\nsections 2 and 3 of this entry.\n\nSecond, there are normative questions about the proper goals that\ninternational law\u2014or its domains, such as international human\nrights law, international environmental law, and international\ncriminal law\u2014should advance and the means by which it may\nproperly do so and, relatedly, how the legitimacy of international law\nis to be assessed. A recurring issue is the extent to which\nethical-political standards fashioned to assess domestic\nlaw\u2014such as democracy, the rule of law, and even legitimacy\nitself\u2014apply to international law (an important theme in the\nwork of Buchanan, e.g., Buchanan 2013). Due to the long period of\nphilosophical neglect of international law, we are still at an early\nstage in forming an adequate picture of the political morality\nappropriate to its distinctive nature and role. These questions are\nmostly discussed in sections 4, 5, and 6 of this entry.\n2. International Law as Law\n\nThe two features of international law most commonly invoked by those\nwho call into question its legal character are the absence of a\ncentralized system of enforcement and the role of state consent in the\nformation of rules of international law. Some legal philosophers,\nwhile recognizing that international law possesses some features\ncharacteristic of law, dispute its status as a genuine and\nfully-fledged legal order (e.g., Hart 1961 [2012]). We consider these\ndifferent strands of arguments on the legal nature of international\nlaw in turn.\n2.1 Lack of Centralized Enforcement Mechanisms\n\nAt the domestic level, law is enforced through both executive power\n(police, tax authorities, regulatory bodies, etc) and judicial power.\nInternational law does not benefit from a comprehensive system of\nexecutive and judicial enforcement that is comparable to what\ndeveloped domestic legal systems can offer. The UN, as the principal\ninternational organization, does perform a unique role particularly in\nthe area of collective peace and security; and its most powerful\norgan, the Security Council, is empowered to adopt decisions under\nChapter VII of the UN Charter that are binding on all member states of\nthe UN and can involve the use of military force. The Security Council\nhas used its enforcement powers since the end of the Cold War, most\nnotably during the First Gulf War in 1990\u20131991 when it\nauthorized its member States to use force to liberate Kuwait following\nIraq\u2019s aggression and invasion. But there are many examples of\ngrave breaches of international law that are not met with any\nenforcement action by the Security Council. As for judicial\nenforcement, international law lacks a centralized dispute settlement\nmechanism that operates independently of the consent of states. It is\ntrue, however, that the role of the International Court of Justice and\nthe proliferation of other international courts and\ntribunals\u2014with jurisdiction over areas such as human rights,\ntrade, investment, international crimes\u2014mean that, in practice,\ninternational law does benefit today from a far greater measure of\nenforcement through courts and tribunals than ever in the past.\n\nSome legal philosophers have responded to the problem of limited\nenforcement by fashioning a theory of international law on the basis\nof the hypothesis\u2014admitted to be a\n\u201cfantasy\u201d\u2014that an international court with\ncompulsory jurisdiction exists and that there are reliable\ninternational institutional mechanisms for giving effect to its\ndecisions (Dworkin 2013;\n section 4.4 below).\n Some have also given a normative interpretation of the relation\nbetween law and enforceability that makes in principle, rather than\nactual, enforceability a touchstone of legality. Thus, according to\nLiam Murphy, when it comes to law\n\n\nwe would regard it as obviously appropriate for provision to be made\nwithin the normative order itself for effective enforcement. Properly\nregulated third-party enforcement is always in principle appropriate.\n(Murphy 2017: 221).\n\n\nAnother solution draws attention to the existence of decentralized\nmodes of enforcement, e.g., \u201coutcasting\u201d, which operate\nnot through centralized institutions, but by denying law-breakers the\nbenefits of membership and cooperation (Hathaway & Shapiro 2011;\nKelsen 1952 [2012: 20\u201325]; Goodman & Jinks, 2013). Finally,\nand more radically, some reject the thesis that enforcement\nmechanisms, centralized or not, are necessary for full-fledged legal\nstatus. It is a mainstream view in contemporary legal philosophy,\nshared by philosophers as diverse as H.L.A. Hart, John Finnis, and\nJoseph Raz, that the concept of law does not involve the idea of\ncoercion as a necessary element (Hart 1961 [2012: 199\u2013200];\nFinnis 2011; Raz 1999: 159; and in relation to international law,\nO\u2019Connell 2008: 62\u20138. For a different view, see Schauer\n2015).\n\nThis mainstream view rejects the command theory of law (e.g., John\nAustin), which construes law as orders of a sovereign backed by the\nthreat of sanctions; the view that the function of law is to identify\ndelicts (conduct characterized as illegal) which are the condition of\na sanction (a coercive act against the law-breaker) (e.g., Kelsen); as\nwell as predictive theories of law (e.g., Oliver Wendell Holmes) which\nreduce law to predictions about the application of sanctions (Hart\n1961 [2012]). Instead, the primary function of law is to provide a\nstructure for generating norms that guide human behaviour, with or\nwithout the existence of effective sanctions, as in Joseph Raz\u2019s\nhypothetical \u201csociety of angels\u201d (Raz 1999: 159). On this\nview, enforcement mechanisms operate as a mere contingent back-up plan\nfor cases where law fails in its primary function.\n\nAs a matter of historical fact, municipal legal systems have\nextensively relied on centralized enforcement mechanisms to encourage\ncompliance, but this does not amount to a conceptual constraint on the\nexistence of law. It is also worth noting Hart\u2019s observation\nthat in the international domain\u2014where it is difficult for\nviolence and wrong-doing to remain hidden from public view\u2014there\nmay be less of a practical need for sanctions to secure compliance\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 218]).\n\nOn this view, what matters for the existence of international law is a\nsufficient level of compliance to underwrite its operation as a\npractically effective system of normative ordering. Though some query\nwhether international legal norms genuinely exert compliance pull of\ntheir own accord, as opposed to on the basis of independent (e.g.,\nself-interested) reasons that favour adopting the pattern of behaviour\nprescribed by law (Goldsmith & Posner 2005), in the famous words\nof Louis Henkin, it is arguably still the case that\n\n\nalmost all nations observe almost all principles of international law\nand almost all of their obligations almost all the time. (Henkin 1979:\n47)\n\n2.2 The Role of Consent in the Formation of Rules of International Law\n\nThe most authoritative statement of the sources of international law\nis found in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of\nJustice (ICJ 1945). Neither of the two main sources of international\nlaw there identified\u2014customary international law and\ntreaties\u2014has an obvious counterpart in domestic law. Arguments\nabout the legal character of international law turn, to a significant\ndegree, on how we understand these two methods of law creation to\nfunction.\n\nLegal philosophers writing about international law have often\nproceeded on the basis that both treaty and custom ultimately depend\non state consent. Ronald Dworkin, for example, believed that the idea\nthat a state is subject to international law only insofar as it has\nconsented to be bound by it reflects what \u201cseems to be now\ngenerally accepted by practitioners and scholars of international\nlaw\u201d (Dworkin 2013: 5). The consent-based account of\ninternational law does indeed enjoy wide support among international\nlawyers too. In one 1996 case, the International Court of Justice\ndescribed consent, alongside sovereignty, as \u201cthe very basis\nof international law\u201d (ICJ 1996: para. 21).\n\nBut is the consent-based account correct in a descriptive sense? Does\nit, in other words, accurately reflect the way in which rules of\ninternational law are generated? When one considers how international\nlaw \u201cworks\u201d, in theory as well as in practice, this\naccount begins to unravel. This was noted by H.L.A. Hart in 1961 when\nhe wrote of\n\n\nthe suspicion that the general theory that all international\nobligation is self-imposed has been inspired by too much abstract\ndogma and too little respect for the facts. (Hart 1961 [2012:\n226])\n\n\nState consent does evidently play an important role in the formation\nof treaties. Treaties do not bind states that are not parties to them\nand have not consented to be so bound (Vienna Convention on the Law of\nTreaties, Article 34 [VCLT 1969]). But among treaties too, there are\nimportant caveats. The right to withdraw unilaterally from a treaty,\nwhich would grant states the full force of consent, does not, for\nexample, apply to all treaties. The UN Charter is generally understood\nnot to be open to unilateral withdrawal: member states of the UN can\nbe expelled from the organization, but they cannot leave it\nvoluntarily. Consent to it is thus irrevocable. States may be said to\nhave consented to all of the rules that descend from UN membership\nwhen they first joined the UN, but the UN Charter is not a static body\nof legal obligations; it also governs processes through which rules of\ninternational law come into existence, and are interpreted and\ndeveloped\u2014processes which will take their course after the\nState\u2019s initial consent to be bound by the Charter.\n\nThe consent-based account runs into even greater difficulties when it\ncomes to custom. There is, first, the notion of jus cogens,\ni.e., rules of customary international law (such as the prohibition on\ntorture, genocide and apartheid) which have acquired peremptory status\nand from which no state is permitted to derogate. Dworkin maintained\nthat jus cogens too comes \u201cunder the umbrella of\nconsent\u201d in contemporary international legal doctrine (Dworkin\n2013: 6), but there is nothing in the definition of jus\ncogens in the Vienna Convention that suggests\n this.[1]\n\nNor, contrary to many accounts, is customary international law, or\ncustom, based on consent. Custom is defined in the Statute of the\nInternational Court of Justice as \u201cgeneral practice accepted as\nlaw\u201d (Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article\n38(1)). This definition is normally understood to comprise two\nelements: an objective one, i.e., the practice of States; and a\nsubjective one, i.e., opinio juris, the acceptance of rules\nas custom. Many of the conceptual errors that afflict discussions of\ncustom, with inevitable repercussions for theoretical arguments about\ninternational law, concern its subjective dimension. Two errors are\ncommon. The first one is to think of opinio juris as\nrequiring state consent to a rule of customary international law.\nAcceptance and consent are, however, different concepts. The\nInternational Court of Justice regularly establishes the existence of\nrules of customary international law without specific evidence of\nconsent from the states concerned (Talmon 2015). The second one is to\ndescribe the subjective element as necessarily involving a belief that\na particular practice is already law.\n\nThere are at least two good descriptive reasons to be sceptical about\nboth the belief- and the consent-based theories of customary\ninternational law. First, they cannot explain why newly independent\nstates are bound by rules of custom in respect of which they never had\nan opportunity to give consent or time to form beliefs (Hart 1961\n[2012: 226]). Secondly, neither the consent-based nor the belief-based\naccount of customary international law can adequately explain change\nin customary rules. Under the consent-based theory, the replacement of\na rule of custom with a contrary one would be explained as a\nconsequence of states withdrawing their consent from, and acting in\nbreach of, the prior rule. Under the belief-based approach, a change\nin custom would be explained by error or insincerity on the part of\nstates, either acting on the erroneous belief that a particular rule\nwas one of customary international law or lying about their\nbelief.\n\nThese descriptive questions have a bearing on conceptual argument\nabout the legal character of international law. If the main engines of\nrule-creation function only on the basis of consent, or depend on the\nbelief and subjective mindset of those that those rules are meant to\nconstrain, the legal character of international law would be, at best,\nseverely diminished; or, at worst, lost entirely because international\nlaw would be robbed of the claim to legitimate authority inherent to\nlaw, a claim that its norms are binding simply as legal rather than as\nvoluntarily or otherwise subjectively assumed.\n\nThese questions also have an impact on argument about the legitimacy\ninternational law, which is discussed below, because as observed by\nJohn Tasioulas, such accounts \u201ctarnish[es] the\nlegitimacy of customary international law\u201d (Tasioulas 2014: 331;\nTasioulas 2016), and undermine both the moral and systemic credentials\nof international law.\n2.4 International Law as \u201cPrimitive Law\u201d: H.L.A. Hart\u2019s Critique\n\nThe most famous post-war critique of international law\u2019s legal\ncharacter is Chapter X of H.L.A. Hart\u2019s The Concept of\nLaw. Hart was not an outright sceptic about the legal character\nof international law, saying we should \u201cneither dismiss the\ndoubt we may feel\u2026 nor shall we simply confirm them\u201d\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 214]). However, he did think international law was\nimpaired in its law-like character by the fact that\n\n\nthe rules for states resemble that simple form of social structure,\nconsisting only of primary rules of obligation, which, when we find it\namong societies of individuals, we are accustomed to contrast to a\ndeveloped legal system. (Hart 1961 [2012: 214])\n\n\nThe resemblance is \u201cin form though not at all in content\u201d\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 232]), given the discrepancy between the content of\nobligations typically imposed by domestic legal systems and those\nimposed by international law.\n\nThe main problem with international law, according to Hart, is that it\nlacks secondary rules. This means it is not law in a modern developed\nsense, but in a simple or primitive one. In Hart\u2019s well-known\nconception, a legal system is a union of two sets of rules: primary\nrules which impose obligations, and secondary rules which are rules\nabout rules, relating to the way in which those primary rules are\nidentified, changed and adjudicated\n upon.[2]\n Hart argues that international law possesses primary rules which are\nfor the most part observed in practice. International law however\nlacks that distinctive secondary rule which Hart calls the the rule of\nrecognition, that is a rule that does not depend for its existence on\nother rules and provides the ultimate foundation on which the legal\nsystem depends.\n\nThese defects, Hart says, make international law not law in the modern\nsense, but law only in a primitive or incomplete sense. Hart\u2019s\ncharacterization of international law as primitive law is a poor fit\nwith his own view of primitive law as law suitable for\n\n\na small community closely knit by ties of kinship, common sentiment,\nand belief, and placed in a stable environment. (Hart 1961 [2012:\n92])\n\n\nThe context in which international law operates is quite different:\nthe total number of States (fewer than 200) would fit the notion of\nsmall community, but the small community of States has none of the\nsocial ties that characterize the communities in which primitive law\noperates.\n\nA typical retort among international lawyers to Hart\u2019s critique\nis that these are just matters of definition. But this answer misses\nthe distinction between terminological and conceptual disagreement.\nHart\u2019s conceptual critique of international law raises crucial\nquestions about its legal character. As Hart himself understood, a\nfailure to conceptualize the social phenomenon that we normally\ndescribe as international law does matter, for it hinders both\n\u201ctheoretical enquiries \u2026 [and] moral deliberation\u201d\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 214]). We need to understand what it is that we are\ntalking about if we want to advance moral and political arguments\nabout international law.\n\nMore fundamentally, Hart\u2019s conclusion that international law\nlacks a rule of recognition needs to be tested against the evolving\nrealities since 1961 when The Concept of Law was first\npublished. Hart was not particularly prescriptive about the form of\nthe rule of recognition:\n\n\n[i]t may, as in the early law of many societies, be no more than that\nan authoritative list or text of the rules is to be found in a written\ndocument or carved on some public monument. (Hart 1961 [2012: 94])\n\n\nBut Hart was dismissive of the possibility that consent or pacta\nsunt servanda could perform such a function: to say\n\u201cinternational law is what states have consented to\u201d or\n\u201cinternational law obligations must be performed\u201d cannot\namount to a rule of recognition.\n\nA promising candidate for the role of secondary rule is the Vienna\nConvention on the Law of Treaties, which is generally understood to\nreflect customary international law. As a treaty about treaties, the\nConvention has come to perform a systemic function by regulating the\nadoption, entry into force, amendment and interpretation of treaties.\nBy providing rules for treaty-making, the Vienna Convention operates\nfor treaties much like the Uniform Commercial Code in the US or the\nCode Civil in France do for contracts. It is, in other words, a set of\nprimary and secondary rules that enables certain promises to have\nlegal effect.\n\nA basic norm to explain the legal character of the Vienna Convention\nmay be Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of\nJustice, a treaty to which all member states of the UN must also be a\nparty. But Article 38 is a treaty provision which, on first\ninspection, does no more than identify the applicable law in disputes\nbrought before the Court. Applicable law clauses are far from\ninfrequent in treaties that provide for judicial settlement of\ndisputes, and their existence supports the non-systemic and episodic\nnature of international law. So in what way can Article 38 be said to\nbe to embody the rule of recognition? Unlike other applicable law\nclauses, Article 38 has come to perform a systemic function, and is\nregularly relied upon by domestic as well as international courts. It\nis foundational at least in an explanatory sense, i.e., as a rule\nabout how \u201cprimary rules may be conclusively ascertained,\nintroduced, eliminated, varied\u201d (Hart 1961 [2012: 94]).\n\nLastly, in the search for a rule of recognition, some have pointed out\nthat features like the inability of states freely to leave the UN, to\ntake one example, have given a constitutional character to\ninternational law. This is not only an exaggeration, but also a\ndistortion of international law\u2014a conceptual over-correction of\nnot treating international law as properly law. Features such as the\nnon-denunciability of the UN Charter do however tell us something\nimportant about the nature of international law: they may evidence a\ndistinctive constitutive force from which international law derives\nfull legal character.\n\nThe above responses to Hart\u2019s ambivalence about the legal status\nof international law has granted his premise that a full-fledged legal\nsystem requires a rule of recognition. Even on this basis, critics\nlike Jeremy Waldron have rejected his \u201cvery poor\u201d\narguments for a qualified scepticism about the legal character of\ninternational law (Waldron 2014: 213). However, Hart\u2019s leading\ncritic, Ronald Dworkin, contested this premise itself. According to\nDworkin, the determination of law is not ultimately grounded in a\nsocial rule\u2014a rule of recognition\u2014widely accepted by\nofficials and others as the right standard for identifying\nlaw. Instead, legal requirements emerge through a process of\n\u201cconstructive interpretation\u201d that requires the\ninterpreter to discern the set of underlying moral-political\nprinciples that best fit and justify the relevant\nlegal materials, e.g., in the case of international law, the raw data\nof treaties, state practice, opinio juris, international\ndeclarations, etc. (Dworkin 1986). Unlike Hart, Dworkin\u2019s view\nof international law is part of his theoretical ambitions to establish\nthat genuine law is morally binding on its subjects (see\n section 4\n on Legitimacy).\n3. States and Sovereignty\n\nThe criteria for determining the existence of statehood are\nwell-established in customary international law (Crawford 1979 [2006:\n38]). They are: a defined territory, a permanent population, an\neffective government, the capacity to enter into relations with other\nStates, and independence. Each of these criteria is related to an\nequally fundamental aspect of international law and inter-state\nrelations: sovereignty. The relationship between sovereignty and\nstatehood is crucial in both legal philosophy and international legal\npractice. Although some consider sovereignty to be coextensive with\nindependence, James Crawford\u2019s seminal work on statehood\nmaintains that whereas independence is a prerequisite for statehood,\nsovereignty \u201chas another more satisfactory meaning as an\nincident or consequence of statehood\u201d (Crawford 1979 [2006:\n89]). This section will explore the various aspects of this\n\u201cmore satisfactory meaning.\u201d\n\nSovereignty can be viewed as the ultimate authority that derives from,\nand attaches to, statehood. On the international plane, though\ninternational organizations exercise some functions normally\nassociated with States, it is traditionally only States that have been\ndescribed as sovereign. This may now be changing as some argue that\nthe European Union, for example, possesses a kind of sovereignty, with\nits member States now being sovereign in a different,\n\u201clate\u201d or post-national, sense (MacCormick 1993 [2006: 4,\n16]; Walker 2003, 9). On the domestic plane, the position is more\ncomplicated given that a larger number of subjects\u2014from monarchs\nto parliaments, from individuals to peoples\u2014have, at various\npoints and in different ways, been considered sovereign (Verdirame\n2016).\n3.1 Absolute Sovereignty\n\nIdentifying the matters over which sovereign states have, or should\nhave, ultimate authority is a difficult task in both an explanatory\nand normative sense. An enduring view is that the sovereignty of the\nState is absolute; a sovereign state is the final arbiter in all\ndomestic matters, with limitations to such absolute sovereignty\npermissible only where the state has consented to them. Under this\nview, the subject matter of state sovereignty covers all legal and\npolitical matters that relate to a state\u2019s territory and people.\nHobbes is the early modern thinker most commonly associated with this\nall-encompassing conception of sovereignty. This interpretation of the\nfew brief passages on international relations in the\nLeviathan is questioned by some scholars (Malcolm 2002), but\nit remains the foundation for theories of absolute sovereignty in\ninternational political thought.\n\nThe problem with theories about absolute sovereignty is that they can\nonly, at best, support a narrow consent-based idea of international\nlaw which, as the discussion of the sources of international law in\nthe earlier section has shown, does not reflect the reality of how\nrules of international law are created, interpreted and applied. Some\nclassical international law thinkers writing in the natural law\ntradition, like Alberico Gentili (Wagner 2017), argued that it was\npossible to reconcile absolute sovereignty with a fuller idea of\ninternational law by postulating that only voluntary (i.e., positive),\nbut not involuntary (i.e., natural law), rules imposed by\ninternational law on states impinge on the concept of absolute\nsovereignty. In other words, one can be absolutely sovereign and still\nsubject to natural law.\n\nWith the exception of this particular natural law tradition,\nproponents of the absolute conception of sovereignty have generally\nbeen viewed as \u201cdeniers of the \u201cLaw of\nNations\u201d\u201d (Hinsley 1986: 184). The criticism is that there\ncan be no international law unless it is accepted that, on\nsome matters at least, states must be irrevocably subject to\nan authority other than their own; the possibility of subjection to an\nexternal authority must be viewed as a necessary requirement for even\nminimal international law.\n\nThe absolute conception of sovereignty also cannot be reconciled with\nthe UN Charter, which recognizes the principle of \u201csovereign\nequality\u201d in Article 2\u2014the same provision where other\ncornerstones for the post-war order, such as the peaceful settlement\nof disputes and the prohibition on the use of force, are laid. As a\nmatter of positive international law in force today, states are not\nfully sovereign\u2014i.e., they are not the final arbiters\u2014on\nmatters pertaining to the use of force. In particular, they are not\nfree to develop a set of rules governing the use of force that\ncontravenes the prohibition in the UN Charter, nor do they have any\nlegal means of escaping such rules by withdrawing their consent. The\nsame can be said of other fundamental principles and rules, such as\nself-determination and human rights.\n\nYet international law still describes states as sovereign. The\nprinciple of sovereignty equality constructs a world order where\nstates are endowed with ultimate authority over some matters, yet\ninescapably subject to the authority of international law in others.\n(For a defence of the idea of sovereignty as a vital mechanism for\nensuring the authority of international law in an ineradicably\npluralistic world in which states disagree on what constitutes a just\nand legitimate internal public order, see Roth 2011).\n\nThat said, it is important not to confuse sovereignty in this sense of\nultimate authority with the idea of economic or political power. For\nexample, to say that the States that emerged from the collapse of the\nEuropean empires after World War II acquired sovereignty on an equal\nbasis as their former colonies is to say that they were endowed with\nthe ultimate authority to decide matters\u2014such as the regulation\nof social and economic activities in their territory\u2014which had\nhitherto been the domain of the colonial powers. Whether these newly\nindependent States also acquired the socio-economic or political clout\nto take on, for example, big multinational corporations operating in\ntheir territory, or whether they became more powerful politically than\nthe former colonial powers, is another matter. To use a different\nexample, by leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom regained\nsovereignty over matters which (unlike colonies of course) it had\nfreely agreed to transfer to the European Union during the time of its\nmembership, but whether this increase in sovereignty means an increase\nin power or influence is a different matter. Authority can be bestowed\nupon those that have no power, and power can be wielded by those with\nno authority.\n3.2 Self-Determination\n\nThere is another fundamental concept that must be factored in to\nexplain the role of sovereignty in modern international law:\nself-determination. Self-determination is prominently mentioned in\nArticle 1(2) of the UN Charter as one of the purposes of the UN. Under\ninternational law, self-determination is a right of all peoples,\ndefined in identical terms in the Charter and the UN International\nCovenants on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and Economic, Social,\nand Cultural Rights (1966), as the right to \u201cfreely determine\ntheir political status and freely pursue their economic, social and\ncultural development.\u201d\n\nSelf-determination is considered to have both an external and internal\ndimension (Crawford 1979; Alston 2017). The external dimension, namely\nthe right of a people to be free from colonial subjugation or foreign\noccupation and control, was historically most transformative at the\ntime of decolonization (Crawford 1979). The internal dimension\nconcerns the rights of people to pursue democratic governance\ndomestically (Franck 1992) and has become increasingly relevant in\ndiscussions about the role of international law in promoting\ndemocracy.\n\nSelf-determination complicates the meaning of sovereignty in\ninternational law. It is conceptually cognate to moral and political\nideas of popular sovereignty and self-government, which are, in turn,\nrelated to the values of self-respect and autonomy. By embracing this\nnotion, international law gave recognition to the moral and political\nvalue of self-government, accepting that people prefer to be ruled by\ntheir own bad rulers rather than foreigners, including those\nforeigners with some claim to greater competence.\n\nSelf-determination adds a new dimension to argument about sovereignty\nin international law also because it is no longer only states that\nadvance a claim to ultimate authority\u2014in some sense, and to some\ndegree, people can too. This means that international law is no longer\nimmune from tensions between the state and the people that have\nfeatured prominently in many political struggles. In cases of\nsecession (Crawford 1979; Buchanan 2008) in particular, the claim of\nthe extant state to ultimate authority can be challenged by a\npopulation now empowered to articulate a competing claim under the\nbanner of an internationally recognized legal principle (the legal\nmerits of such competing claims will, of course, vary).\n\nIf sovereignty is thought of as a quality that both states and peoples\npossess, the analogy between sovereignty and human autonomy, advanced\nby Timothy Endicott, makes more sense. Moreover, understood as both\ncomplete power within a political community and complete independence\nneeded for the purposes of a good state, sovereignty is compatible\nwith the legitimate authority of international law and ameliorates the\nworry about abuses (Endicott 2010). Such power and freedom must be\nsubject to law but, just as with individual autonomy, it is wrong to\nthink that these qualities must be forgone as a price for such\nsubjection.\n3.4 International Organizations and Sovereignty\n\nThe phenomenon of international organization adds further conceptual,\nmoral and political challenges to the idea of sovereignty. The key\nquestion is one that Rousseau first posed in the Emile:\n\n\nHow far should the rights of an international federation be stretched\nwithout destroying the rights of national sovereignty? (1762 [1979:\n466])\n\n\nThe context is different in the sense that, instead of the single\ninternational federation envisaged by Rousseau, international law has\ndeveloped through a multitude of universal and regional international\norganizations.\n\nBut questions about the boundaries between the domestic and the\ninternational legal sphere, and their respective institutions, are\neven more important nowadays as international organizations exercise\nfunctions that once were within the exclusive domain of states. These\nquestions lie at the heart of the most recent debates about\ninternational law, populism (M\u00fcller 2016; Alston 2017) and the\nrise of authoritarian international law (Ginsburg 2020). Some question\nthe dualism or pluralism on which these arguments are premised, and\nprefer to think of domestic and international law as forming part of\nthe same legal order. Kelsen was the most famous proponent of these\n\u201cmonist\u201d conceptions (Bernstorff 2010; for another attempt\nto show the compatibility of state sovereignty with the authority of\ninternational law with the notion of changing sovereignty regimes and\nconstitutional pluralism, see Jean Cohen 2010).\n\nAn important set of normative questions concerns the relationship\nbetween international organizations and political and individual\nliberty. Some argue that while the transfer of sovereign functions to\ninternational organizations can be justified for a number of moral and\npolitical reasons, it cannot extend to the point where it jeopardizes\nhuman rights or hollows out self-government\u2014these limits are\nnecessary to preserve the liberal character of the international order\n(Verdirame 2013).\n\nMany contemporary writers focus on the European Union, which has been\ndescribed as \u201csupranational\u201d, rather than international,\nin light of the direct primacy that EU law enjoys within domestic\nlegal spheres (Neyer & Wiener 2011a; van Middelaar 2013). Whether\nsupranationalism is a way of ascribing sovereignty to the European\nUnion or a way of reconceiving the legal order in a\npost-sovereignist and cosmopolitan sense is an open debate\n(Eriksen 2011). For others, the process of European integration poses\na challenge to the modern liberal constitutional sense of sovereignty\nas understood to include the \u201coverall competency and\nresponsibility for the common welfare of the people united into a\npolity\u2026.\u201d, and the shift of the regulatory power over the\neconomy away from the State risks paving the way for \u201ca\nfragmentation of the care for the common good\u201d\n(B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde 1997).\n\nThese normative concerns become more acute in the case of a fully\nfledged world government. Kant, in Perpetual Peace, reached a\nfamously sobering conclusion on the prospect of international\norganizations developing into such a world government:\n\n\nThe idea of the right of nations presupposes the separation of many\nneighbouring states independent of one another; and though such a\ncondition is of itself a condition of war (unless a federative union\nof them prevents the outbreak of hostilities), this is nevertheless\nbetter, in accordance with the idea of reason, than the fusion of them\nby one power overgrowing the rest and passing into a universal\nmonarchy, since as the range of government expands laws progressively\nlose their vigour, and a soulless despotism, after it has destroyed\nthe seed of good, finally deteriorates into anarchy. (Kant 1795 [1996:\n336])\n\n\nOne of the leading contemporary political and legal philosophers,\nJoseph Raz, shares Kant\u2019s scepticism about world government, but\nargues that there may be a better alternative to world government than\na world of sovereign states. That alternative is one of relatively\nsovereign states, which are however subject to binding regulations\nissued by international organizations (Raz 2019).\n\nThe balancing act between cosmopolitan international law (i.e., law\nthat binds all states) and domestic sovereignty is famously explored\nin John Rawls\u2019 Law of Peoples (Rawls 1999; see also\nWenar 2008 [2021]). Rawls himself does not use the concept\n\u201csovereignty\u201d, or \u201cstate\u201d, in relation to the\nsocieties that are members of his \u201cSociety of Peoples\u201d,\nbut that is because he associates \u201csovereignty\u201d with an\nabsolutist conception, and regards \u201cstates\u201d as claiming\nsuch sovereignty. In contrast, his theory upholds a more restricted\nnotion of sovereignty for \u201cwell-ordered peoples\u201d. Such\npeoples enjoy both legitimacy with respect to their own citizens and\nfull international standing in the Society of Peoples, which includes\nimmunity from intervention.\n4. Legitimacy\n4.1 Senses of Legitimacy\n\nThere are multiple ways of assessing the various dimensions of\ninternational law, such as its individual norms or bodies of norms\n(e.g., international human rights law, humanitarian law etc.) and its\nassociated institutions and enforcement mechanisms (e.g., the\nInternational Court of Justice, Security Council resolutions, etc).\nSome of these assessments relate to how international law and\ninstitutions bear on a given state\u2019s interests or policy\npreferences; others are in terms of efficiency or impact on economic\ngrowth; some are more overtly moral forms of assessment, invoking\ndemands of peace, the rule of law, justice, environmental protection,\nand so on. Of course, a key debate in international relations concerns\nthe extent to which moral values find a foothold in an international\ndomain that is \u201canarchic\u201d in the sense of lacking a\nsovereign political authority or reliable enforcement mechanisms.\n\nOne prominent moral-political rubric for assessing international law\nis the contested idea of \u201clegitimacy\u201d. Sometimes\n\u201clegitimacy\u201d is used as a catch-all term encompassing any\nkind of assessment of law, but this usage is too broad. A\nstarting-point in achieving greater specificity is the distinction\nbetween de facto (or descriptive) and de jure (or\nnormative) interpretations of legitimacy. Sometimes talk of the\n\u201clegitimacy\u201d of international law is a matter of\ndescribing the degree to which it is accepted, or complied with, by\nits putative subjects, primarily states. On this de facto\ninterpretation, an international legal norm will enjoy legitimacy to\nthe extent that it exerts a high level of \u201ccompliance\npull\u201d among international actors. A substantive study of de\nfacto legitimacy investigates the features that tend to enhance\nsupport for, and compliance with, international law (Franck 1995).\n\nBy contrast, de jure senses of \u201clegitimacy\u201d refer\nto the capacity of international law to generate reasons for action of\nvarious kinds. These might be reasons, whether prudential or moral, to\nestablish international laws and institutions, to preserve and develop\nthem once they exist, or not to interfere with their operations\n(Buchanan 2013). But de jure legitimacy is often taken to\nmean something more ambitious: the existence of a \u201cright to\nrule\u201d. On this view, some domain or institution of international\nlaw enjoys de jure legitimacy to the extent that its putative\nsubjects have a pro tanto or defeasible moral obligation to\ncomply with its directives, one that is content-independent, i.e., not\ndependent for its binding force on the specific content of any\nparticular law (Raz 2006; Green 2004 [2012]). This sense of de\njure legitimacy, as the right to rule, corresponds to the kind\nlegitimate authority that states are often interpreted as asserting in\nrelation to their members.\n\nJust as it is controversial whether international law is truly law,\nsome have also raised doubts as to whether international law should be\nassessed in terms of the \u201cright to rule\u201d asserted by\nstates. A lot of international law takes the form of treaties that\nbind only states that are parties to them. It might seem that the idea\nof a promise or contract, rather than that of legitimate rule, is the\nright template for assessing the normative force of such treaties.\nMoreover, the other main source of international law, customary\ninternational law, being the product of the convergent practice and\nattitudes of disparate state actors, does not assert a right to rule\nin the way that a unitary ruler, whether an individual or group, such\nas a legislative body, does. Yet others have claimed that, insofar as\nwe can impute a claim to rule to international law, it is not as\nstrong as that made by states, but amounts instead to a claim of the\nexistence of a moral reason for maintaining and conforming to\ninternational law, not in a content-independent moral obligation\n(Buchanan 2013).\n\nBut assuming that a right to rule is an assertion plausibly imputable\nto international law and institutions, how can we determine whether it\nis ever justified? The question is rendered all the more acute by the\nfact that in recent decades international law has increasingly\nasserted a more expansive right to rule, one that encroaches into\nareas previously regarded as belonging to the domain of state\nauthority, including such matters as the basic rights of its own\ncitizens, economic and environmental policy, and the provision of\nvital goods such as education and health care.\n4.2 Consent Theory\n\nOne prominent approach traces the legitimacy of international law to\nthe actual consent (explicit or implicit) of its subjects. States are\nbound by treaties insofar as they consent to them; meanwhile, states\nare bound by customary international law insofar as they have\nexplicitly (opinio juris) consented to its norms in the\nprocess of their formation, or else implicitly done so (e.g., by\nfailing persistently to object to them). One problem with the consent\ntheory is that international law includes norms that purport to bind\nstates independently of whether they consented to them, such as norms\nthat came into being before the state came into existence, or norms\nthat have achieved the status of jus cogens norms (Dworkin\n2013). In response, the steadfast defender of the consent view might\nreply, \u201cSo much the worse for the legitimacy of these\nnorms\u201d.\n\nEven if we were to accept this hard-line response, a deeper challenge\nremains: why, if international law can help us achieve vital\ngoals\u2014such as the avoidance of war, prevention of human rights\nabuses or the mitigation of climate change\u2014on condition that all\nstates generally comply with it, should its authority over them be\nsubject to their consent? The question is all the more pointed once it\nis recognized that the governments of many states do not themselves\nenjoy the consent of their own subjects or even perpetrate grave\ninjustices against them. Considerations such as these have led many to\nconclude that, contrary to received views, actual consent is not in\ngeneral a necessary condition for international law\u2019s legitimacy\nbut is, at best, an idea that plays an important but limited role in\nexplaining the bindingness of treaties. Nor, it has been argued, is\nactual consent generally a sufficient condition for legitimacy, since\nstate consent to treaties that require the commission of human rights\nabuses would not be even presumptively binding (Buchanan 2010;\nTasioulas 2010; Murphy 2017).\n\nOne familiar move is to resort to a hypothetical version of consent\ntheory, appealing not to the actual consent of states, but to\ninternational standards that states have good reason to accept. Such a\nview is propounded by Rawls in The Law of Peoples, which\nenvisions legitimate international law as grounded in principles\n(\u201cthe Law of Peoples\u201d) that would be endorsed in social\ncontracts at two levels: first, among liberal peoples as regulating\nforeign relations among themselves; second, among liberal peoples\ntogether with a sub-category of non-liberal peoples\u2014decent\nhierarchical peoples. Rawls\u2019 account, however, is problematic in\na number of ways. First, it presupposes that decent hierarchical\nprinciples enjoy legitimacy with respect to their own populations\ndespite not adhering to basic liberal rights, such as freedom of\nspeech and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex or religion.\nSecond, and relatedly, the doctrine of human rights embodied in the\nLaw of Peoples is very minimalist, excluding not only the\naforementioned rights, but also socio-economic rights such as the\nrights to health, work, and an adequate standard of living. Finally,\ndespite its minimalism, Rawls\u2019 Law of Peoples is ultimately\ngrounded in the perspective of liberal societies\u2014the only\nmembers of the Society of Peoples that are \u201cfully\nreasonable\u201d. But given that \u201creasonableness\u201d is\ndefined by stipulation as stemming from ideas implicit in liberal\ndemocratic culture, rather than by reference to an objectively true\ncriterion, the whole approach is vulnerable to accusations of\nparochialism. (For another attempt to mobilize Rawlsian approach to\ninternational legal legitimacy, with a focus on the great pluralism\nthat characterizes the international order, see Roth 2011:\nch.2\u20134).\n4.3 The Service Conception\n\nDifficulties with consent-based, or voluntarist, theories have led to\nthe exploration of alternative bases for the legitimacy of\ninternational law, especially in relation to those obligations not\ntraceable to a treaty. The two following approaches are not only\nnon-voluntarist, but they also make reference to objective standards\nof reason. One approach is inspired by Joseph Raz\u2019s influential\n\u201cservice conception of authority\u201d, which advances a Normal\nJustification Condition (NJC) on legitimate authority. According to\nthe NJC:\n\n\nA has legitimate authority over B if the latter would better conform\nwith reasons that apply to him if he intends to be guided by A\u2019s\ndirectives than if he does not. (Raz 2006: 1014; Tasioulas 2010, 2013)\n\n\nThe NJC purports to specify a generally applicable sufficient\ncondition of legitimate authority. An important feature of it is that\nit does not present the legitimacy of international law in an\nall-or-nothing manner, and this is so in two ways (Tasioulas\n2010). First, it may be that some areas of international law (e.g.,\nthe law on the use of force) enjoy legitimacy, whereas others (e.g.,\ninternational trade law) do not.  Second, it may be that some states\nare bound by a given area of international law, such as human rights\nlaw, whereas others are not.  This is because the former, but not the\nlatter, would better comply with reasons that apply to them by being\nbound by that international legal regime, whereas others would\nnot. This second possibility enables the Razian theory to accommodate\nthe possibility of a justified exceptionalism in relation to the\nlegitimate authority of international law. This is one potential\ntemplate for defending familiar claims that the United States, for\nexample, is not bound by norms on the use of force that properly bind\nother states because it should be free to use its immense capabilities\nto further the cause of justice around the globe in ways that other\nstates cannot. But a similar argument for exceptionalism might be\npressed in the case of weaker or poorer states in relation to\ninternational obligations\u2014for example, pertaining to free trade\nor environmental protection\u2014that are unduly burdensome for\nthem.\n\nLeaving aside the possibility of exceptionalism, the Razian theory\nfaces the challenge of how to integrate a proper respect for state\nsovereignty. To what extent, for example, does a due regard for\nsovereignty entail that there are certain matters that fall within the\njurisdiction of states and regarding which international law cannot\ninvalidate or override their decisions? The question is broadly\nanalogous to that which arises in the domestic context: to what extent\nis the authority of the state limited by a due respect for the\nautonomy of its citizens, such that the state should not seek to\nimpose obligations with respect to certain matters, e.g., selection of\noccupation or spouse, even if its directives would lead to greater\ncompliance by citizens with reasons applicable to them? Of course, the\nstate is an institution, one lacking the basic moral status of\nindividual human beings, but the question arises because of the value\nof collective identity and self-determination that is protected by\nsovereignty. In this connection, Raz has controversially proposed a\nmutually exclusive relationship between state sovereignty and a sound\ninternational human rights law (Raz 2010). Over and above state\nsovereignty as a constraint on the legitimacy of international law,\nthere is a more general question of how such authority is constrained\nby a proper principle of subsidiarity that favours the resolution of\npolitical questions at the most local level possible (F\u00f8llesdal\n1998; Finnis 2016). Finally, a special challenge arises regarding\ninternational law\u2019s claim to legitimate authority in the absence\nof its creation through democratic means, especially in relation to\nstates that are themselves democracies (see section 4.5).\n\nQuestions arise, however, about the extent to which any domain of\ninternational law can achieve legitimacy in these terms, especially\ngiven the absence of reliable enforcement mechanisms at the global\nlevel. This is because, on the NJC, one way in which legitimacy can be\nacquired is through the capacity of legal institutions effectively to\nimpose solutions to various societal problems\u2014such as\nco-ordination problems regarding environmental\nprotection\u2014through its capacity to enforce the standards it lays\ndown. This reveals the familiar substantive dependence of de\njure legitimacy on de facto legitimacy: the fact that\nthe subjects of law are likely to comply with it enhances its\nlegitimacy. Some have questioned whether international law can claim\nany legitimacy given the absence of reliable enforcement mechanisms\n(Posner 2009). This is a problem that is especially acute in the area\nof international human rights law, since the usual expedient of a\ntit-for-tat response to another state\u2019s defection from the law\nseems out of place here. It will hardly be an incentive for state X to\ncomply with international human rights law if state Y threatens\nnon-compliance in relation to its own citizens.\n\nBut even in the case of international human rights law, various\nresponses have been offered. One line of response calls into question\nthe need for the \u201cenforcement\u201d of international law to be\nglobal in character. The seminal work of Beth Simmons on the\neffectiveness of human rights treaties has shown that, insofar as\nmembership of such treaty regimes tends to enhance human rights\ncompliance, the mechanisms through which this is achieved are\nprimarily those of domestic politics rather than a \u201cwhite\nknight\u201d foreign state or international agents (Simmons 2009).\nMore generally, as we saw above (\u00a72.1), states in general tend to\nconform with their international legal obligations (Henkin 1979: 47).\nAnother line of response appeals not to the effectiveness of\ninternational law, but its supposed epistemic superiority, deriving\nfrom its pooling of cross-cultural knowledge in identifying solutions\nto common problems, such as the content of human rights (Buchanan\n2008). However, it is doubtful that a bare claim to epistemic\nsuperiority can justify a claim to practical, as opposed to\ntheoretical, authority, i.e., a claim about what we have reason to do,\nas opposed to what we have reason to believe (Tasioulas 2013).\n4.4 The Principle of Salience\n\nAn alternative way of dealing with the legitimacy of international\nlaw, given the absence of reliable enforcement mechanisms, is offered\nby Ronald Dworkin (2013). For Dworkin, legitimacy concerns not only a\nmoral obligation of obedience, but one that is reliably\nenforceable through the courts. Given the absence of any\ninternational court with compulsory jurisdiction and reliable\nenforcement mechanisms, it could be argued that on this interpretation\nof legitimacy the question of international law\u2019s legitimacy\nsimply does not arise. As we noted previously (2.1), Dworkin avoids\nthis sceptical conclusion by proceeding on the \u201cfantasy\u201d\nthat such a court exists, that cases can be readily brought before it,\nand that there are effective sanctions to enforce its rulings. Dworkin\nclaims we can discern the binding requirements of international law by\nasking:\n\n\nWhat tests or arguments should that hypothetical court adopt to\ndetermine the rights and obligations of states (and other\ninternational actors and organizations) that it would be\nappropriate for it to enforce coercively? (Dworkin 2013:\n14)\n\n\nTwo more general obligations are then appealed to by Dworkin in\nanswering this question.\n\nThe first is a general obligation incumbent upon all states to\nundertake steps that enhance their own political legitimacy, as well\nas of the international legal order in which states operate. Such\nsteps include\n\nupholding human rights at home and abroad;\nguaranteeing the assistance of the international community against\ninvasion and other external threats to a state\u2019s\nindependence;\nencouraging international cooperation; and\nenabling people to have some role in their own government (Dworkin\n2013: 18).\n\n\nBut this obligation of mitigation suffers from considerable\nindeterminacy, given the existence of reasonable disagreement about\nthe best way to improve the legitimacy of the existing international\nlegal order. As a remedy, Dworkin invokes a second basic obligation on\nstates, the principle of salience:\n\n\nIf a significant number of states, encompassing a significant\npopulation, has developed an agreed code of practice, either by treaty\nor by other form of coordination, then other states have at least a\nprima facie duty to subscribe to that practice as well, with the\nimportant proviso that this duty holds only if a more general practice\nto that effect, expanded in that way, would improve the legitimacy of\nthe subscribing state and the international order as a whole. (Dworkin\n2013: 19)\n\n\nThe result is that a state will be \u201cprima facie\u201d bound to\ncomply with an emerging consensus, of the kind described, if doing so\nwill enhance its legitimacy, and it will enhance its legitimacy if\ncompliance would help ameliorate some of the four problems of the\nstate system identified above. Applying this principle, Dworkin\nbelieves that the basic elements of the UN system, including the UN\nCharter, the Geneva Conventions, the conventions on genocide, and the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court, have acquired\nsalience of this kind, such that all states now have an obligation to\nobey them as law, irrespective of whether they have consented to them\n(Dworkin 2013: 20).\n\nDworkin\u2019s resort to fantasy, however, raises questions. Critics\nof a Razian persuasion will claim that an appeal to a fantasy court is\nnecessitated only by Dworkin\u2019s adoption of an unduly restrictive\nconception of legitimacy centred on the judicial enforcement of law.\nBut the essence of legitimate authority is the existence of a\ncontent-independent obligation of obedience, not the subsidiary\nquestion of whether it is properly enforceable, let alone enforceable\nthrough the courts. Another difficulty is that it seems problematic to\nderive obligations to obey international law here and now on the basis\nof a fantasy scenario that bears little relation to any existing, or\nreasonably foreseeable, reality. For example, why should the fact that\nthere is plausibly an obligation to obey the International Criminal\nCourt in a hypothetical world in which it operates impartially and\neffectively tell us anything much about states\u2019 obligations in\nthe current world in which its impartiality and effectiveness are\nmatters of heated controversy? At a more methodological level, many\nwill baulk at Dworkin\u2019s tendency to run together the question of\nthe existence of international law with that of its legitimacy, since\nthey would reject his thesis that law is of its nature presumptively\nlegitimate (Tasioulas 2021). For some other treatments of the\nlegitimacy of international law, see Besson, Christiano, and Pettit in\nBesson and Tasioulas (2010); also regarding particular institutions,\nsuch as courts F\u00f8llesdal 1998)).\n4.5 Democracy\n\nSome believe there is an intimate link between democracy and political\nlegitimacy, at least in the domestic context. They regard the\ndemocratic enactment of law, or at least the subjection of any source\nof law to democratic control, as a necessary condition of its\nlegitimacy, if not also a sufficient one. But even many of those who\ndo not treat democracy as a universally necessary or sufficient\ncondition for legitimacy\u2014such as advocates of the service\nconception or the salience principle\u2014accept that democratic\nlaw-making processes augment the legitimacy of the laws they produce.\nOf course, the proper characterization of democracy is itself a\ncontested matter\u2014ranging from simple majoritarianism, on the one\nhand, to sophisticated deliberative conceptions of democracy, on the\nother. For present purposes, however, we can take democracy to involve\nthe idea of participatory self-government, in which those subject to\nlaws participate as free and equals in deliberation and\ndecision-making leading to the enactment of laws.\n\nVarious difficult questions arise as to the relationship between\ninternational law and democracy, such as whether non-democratic states\nshould have full sovereign status or whether international law should\nencourage the spread of democracy around the globe, perhaps by\nrecognizing and upholding a human right to democracy (Franck 1992 and\n1995: ch.4; Dworkin 2013). However, two other questions are\nparticularly salient under the rubric of legitimacy: (1) should the\nprocess of international law-making be democratic?, and (2) can\ninternational legal norms enjoy legitimacy in the case of democratic\nstates that have not consented to be bound by them?\n\nRegarding the first question, it is obvious that existing systems for\nthe generation of international law (e.g., custom and treaties) are\nnot meaningfully \u201cdemocratic\u201d. International law is\ncreated by states, many of which are not themselves democratic, and\nthe process by which they create such law cannot itself be described\nas democratic. However, many writers have advocated introducing\ndemocratic features into international law-making. One example is\nRonald Dworkin, who canvassed the idea of establishing a world\nlegislative body through a Global Legislative Convention. The body\nwould operate by means of a four-majorities system. Proposed laws\nwould need to receive votes representing states with a majority of the\nUN General Assembly\u2019s members\u2019 total populations, a\nmajority of votes in the General Assembly, a majority of votes in the\nSecurity Council, and a majority of votes among the Council\u2019s\npermanent members (Dworkin 2013: 28). One potential concern about this\nproposal is that it operates via majorities among states\n(weighted to some extent by their populations), rather than among all\nindividual persons throughout the globe. This worry may be mitigated\nsomewhat if we suppose that the states participating in this process\nmust themselves be sufficiently representative of their\npopulations.\n\nOthers, however, defend more ambitious schemes that involve the direct\nrepresentation of the global population. For example, Thomas Franck\nproposed towards the transformation of the UN General Assembly into a\nbicameral forum, with one chamber for states and another being\ndirectly elected (Franck 1995: Part V; for other such proposals of\nglobal democratic institutions, including a global direct\n\u201cvirtual\u201d democratic assembly, see Held 1995; Falk &\nStrauss 2000). Democratic reforms of this sort attract scepticism not\nonly on the basis that states are unlikely to cede power to a global\ndemocratic populace, but also because genuine democracy requires forms\nof entitlement, deliberation and solidarity (e.g., equal rights of\nparticipation, a robust civil society (e.g., mass political parties to\nmediate between individuals and officials, concern for a common good,\netc) that cannot be realistically replicated at the global level). In\nthis sceptical vein, Thomas Christiano has written that global\ndemocracy\n\n\nis highly unlikely to succeed given the weakness of global civil\nsociety and it is highly unlikely to be legitimate given the\nunevenness of stakes and given the high chance of permanent\nminorities. (Christiano 2010: 137)\n\n\nHe prefers, instead, the idea of a fair association of democratic\nstates operating on the basis of a constrained principle of consent.\n(For a discussion of international legitimacy from a neo-republican\nperspective that incorporates democratic elements, see Pettit\n2010).\n\nThe second question, identified above, is whether democratic states,\nin particular, have an obligation to obey international legal norms\nthey have not consented to or incorporated into their domestic law\nthrough democratic procedures. Recent international law, especially\nthrough expansive conceptions of customary international law and\njus cogens, has significantly increased the number of norms\nwhich bind states, even in the absence of their consent. This has\ncreated a backlash, especially among \u201cneo-conservative\u201d\ncommentators who deny that any such laws can bind a constitutional\ndemocracy, at least in the absence of its consent expressed by means\nof internal democratic processes (Rabkin 2005; Kyl, Feith, & Fonte\n2013). But this sort of concern extends beyond neo-conservative\ndefenders of American exceptionalism; for example, Martha Nussbaum, a\nleading liberal political philosopher, has argued that domestic\ndemocratic endorsement is a condition of international law\u2019s\nlegitimacy (Nussbaum 2018\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nGiven that existing international law-making processes are not even\nweakly democratic, and that there is no realistic prospect that they\nwill become so anytime in the foreseeable future, why should they be\nregarded as binding on democratic states in the absence of their\nconsent or democratic incorporation into their own legal systems? The\nproblem of integrating international and democratic governance is one\nof the most serious challenges facing us today, and it is echoed in\nsimilar challenges confronting regional governmental blocs, such as\nthe European Union, that assert authority over their constituent\ndemocratic member states.\n\nOne line of response begins by arguing that democracy is not the\nultimate touchstone of legitimacy, whether of international or\ndomestic law, and that, for example, consent theory, the service\nconception of legitimate authority, or the principle of salience can\njustify the international legal order\u2019s legitimacy even in\nrelation to democratic states. This line of thought leaves unaddressed\nspecific worries regarding how intrusive international law can be with\nrespect to the decision-making of democratic states without\ncompromising or forfeiting its claim to legitimacy or causing undue\ndamage to domestic democratic governance. For a sophisticated attempt\nto articulate ways of arriving at an acceptable balance between the\ngoods of international law and constitutional democracy, see Buchanan\nand Powell 2008. A notable element of their account is the defence of\n\u201cprinciple M\u201d, i.e.,\n\n\nwhere the acceptance of international law by a constitutional\ndemocracy can be reasonably expected to result in constitutional\nchanges\u2014significant alterations in constitutional\nstructures or significant diminutions in political\nself-determination\u2014then, as with other constitutional changes\n(such as consensual secession, accession to a federation, or\ndevolution from a centralized state), there is a strong presumption\nthat public constitutional deliberation and popular choice are\nrequired. (Buchanan & Powell 2008: 347)\n\n5. International Rule of Law\n5.1 The Rule of Law\u2014Thick and Thin\n\nOne of the key determinants of the legitimacy of a legal order is the\nextent of its compliance with the widely acclaimed, but deeply\ncontested, value commonly designated as \u201cthe rule of law\u201d.\nAn initial problem is that the phrase \u201cthe rule of law\u201d is\nused to mean many different things. It is important to avoid confusing\nthe rule of law with the idea of rule by law. The\nlatter refers to the idea of governance through the means, and under\nthe constraint of, positive law. But the fact that a mode of\ngovernance assumes a recognizably legal form does not necessarily\nreveal anything about its value. When the expression \u201crule of\nlaw\u201d is used to mean rule by law, there is no meaningful\ndifference between, for example, a call to respect the rule of law in\ninternational relations and a simple call to respect international\nlaw.\n\nIf, however, we think of the rule of law as an evaluative\nnotion, different and important issues arise. One of them is whether\nthe rule of law properly extends to the evaluation of international\nlaw and, if so, under which interpretation and with what concrete\nimplications. This debate partly reflects background disagreements\nabout the rule of law more generally. Another downstream question is\nto what extent, and in what form, the ethical-political ideal of the\nrule of law, has been, or should be, specified as a set of legal\nrequirements within international law itself, analogously to the\nmanner in which international human rights law crystallizes a\nbackground morality of human rights (Arajavi 2021). In this section,\nthe focus will be on the prior, more foundational issue.\n\nLegal philosophers disagree about the proper characterization of the\nrule of law, their differing views occupying varying points along a\nspectrum from \u201cthin\u201d, or formal-procedural, to\nincreasingly \u201cthick\u201d, or substantive, accounts (Waldron\n2016; Tasioulas 2020a). \u201cThick\u201d accounts of the rule of\nlaw identify it with something approaching all the requirements,\nformal-procedural and substantive, good law should satisfy; or all the\nrequirements that make for legitimate law (Beyleveld & Brownsword\n2007); or all the demands of political justice (rights) that bear on\nlaw (Dworkin 2011); or else some favoured comprehensive catalogue of\nlegally-relevant desiderata, such as compliance with democracy and\nhuman rights (Bingham 2010; Annan 2004). The thicker one\u2019s\nfavoured account of the rule of law, the more demanding a standard it\nsets for the international legal order. This has led some advocates of\nthick accounts to conclude that the rule of law does not apply to\ninternational law, since it imposes demands that cannot feasibly be\nmade of international, rather than domestic, law.\n\nOne such advocate of a thick account is James Crawford, a former Judge\non the International Court of Justice. Crawford identifies five\nrequirements imposed by the rule of law:\n\n\nfirst, that no one is outside the law, still less above it; second,\nthat it is by some means or in some sense democratic, at least in the\nsense of being accountable to others; third, that its instituted\nauthorities\u2014notably the Security Council\u2014are in principle\nsubject to legal constraint; fourth, that there is something like a\nconstitution of international society; and fifth, that society is not\nirremediably unjust. (Crawford 2014: 343)\n\n\nAs Crawford shows, existing international law in general struggles to\nmeet each of these desiderata; at best, perhaps only certain\n\u201cenclaves\u201d of international law do so (Crawford 2014:\n367).\n\nOne might conclude from his analysis that full compliance with the\nrule of law is an unrealistic demand to place on the international\nlegal order, ignoring, as it does, salient disanalogies between the\ndomestic and international spheres, such as the absence of a\ncentralized legislative authority, courts with compulsory\njurisdiction, and effective enforcement mechanisms, as well as forms\nof international solidarity needed to make democratic governance\nfeasible. Crawford himself draws the conclusion that there can only be\na rule of law in international law in the thin, formal, sense\n(Crawford 2014: 375), not the full, substantive, sense incorporating\nall five of his requirements. (For more optimistic proponents of\n\u201cthick\u201d conceptions of the international rule of law, one\nthat incorporates respect for human rights, see McCorquodale 2016 and\nPavel 2021).\n\nOthers, who are proponents of the thin view of the rule of law, will\nrespond to Crawford\u2019s conclusion by saying that the\n\u201cthin\u201d view of the rule of law is the correct one in\ngeneral. For these philosophers, \u201cthick\u201d accounts of the\nrule of law err in lumping together a series of requirements on law\nthat either have no underlying coherence or which simply replicate\nother standards for its evaluation, thereby obscuring the distinctive\nform of assessment imported by a thinner account of the rule of law as\none moral-political demand upon law among others (Tasioulas\n2020a).\n5.2 Thin Theories of the International Rule of Law\n\nInternational law may fare better on \u201cthin\u201d accounts of\nthe rule of law, as these are limited to a familiar set of\nformal-procedural desiderata that are not intended to be exhaustive of\nthe desiderata applicable to the assessment of law (Franck 1995;\nChesterman 2008). These desiderata include the following: that legal\nnorms be expressed in general, prospective, and clear terms, that they\nare relatively stable over time and do not issue in conflicting\ndemands or demands that cannot be feasibly complied with, that\nofficials (judges, bureaucrats, police etc) charged with applying them\ndo so consistently and in accordance with their meaning, and so on\n(Raz 1979: 214\u20138; Fuller, 1964: 33\u201341). These\nformal-procedural requirements are usually thought to require certain\ninstitutional arrangements for their effective realization, such as an\nindependent judiciary and access to professional legal advice.\n\nWhile proponents of the thin theory admit that compliance with the\nrule of law, so understood, is compatible with extreme injustice, it\nnonetheless has inherent value, an important way of respecting those\nsubject to laws as rational agents who are given the opportunity to\ntake legal norms into account in their practical deliberation prior to\nreaching a decision (Fuller 1964: 162; Raz 1979: 221; Finnis 2011:\n273). In this way, it acts as a significant, but not comprehensive,\nlimitation on certain forms of arbitrary official power. Moreover,\nsome requirements of the rule of law, such as the prohibition of\nretrospective punishment, seem to capture basic demands of justice.\nFinally, the rule of law has various kinds of instrumental value, such\nas helping achieve social goods including economic efficiency (by\nfostering a predictable environment for economic decision-making) and\ndemocratic governance (by ensuring, for example, that laws enacted\ndemocratically are effectively applied according to their terms).\n\nBut even on a thin interpretation of the rule of law, there are\nproblems about its applicability to international law. Jeremy Waldron\nhas highlighted two major disanalogies between domestic and\ninternational law that bear on the applicability of the rule of law\nideal in the case of the latter (Waldron 2011). The first is that,\nunlike ordinary citizens in domestic legal systems who are contrasted\nwith officials, states in the international legal order are both the\nsubjects of international law and its officials (its creators, e.g.,\nvia treaty-making and processes of customary international law, and\nits enforcers, e.g., via countermeasures). The second disanalogy is\nthat, unlike individual human beings, states do not have inherent\nmoral value; in particular, their freedom seems to be valuable only\ninsofar as it serves the interests of individual human beings. One\npractical upshot of both of these disanalogies is that we cannot\nreadily proceed on the assumption, which is justified in the domestic\ncase in relation to the conduct of individuals, that state conduct\nshould be free of official interference unless clearly circumscribed\nby law. One response to Waldron\u2019s first disanalogy is to say\nthat it is a matter of degree; even in a domestic legal order,\ncompliance with the rule of law will depend upon the attitudes and\nhabits of ordinary citizens in sustaining a rule of law respecting\nculture. Meanwhile, one response to the second disanalogy is to argue\nthat although state autonomy is not inherently valuable, it acquires\nvalue derivatively, as a means of protecting the autonomy of\nindividuals and groups within states (Pavel 2021: 346).\n\nFinally, some argue that the enormous power disparities among states,\ncombined with the absence of centralized and effective enforcement\nmechanisms, pose a systemic obstacle to the realization of the rule of\nlaw (Posner 2009). It is an open question to what extent the\nproliferation of discrete international legal regimes, e.g., relating\nto trade, human rights, with associated adjudicatory mechanisms, e.g.,\nWorld Trade Organization, regional human rights courts such as the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights or the Inter-American Court of Human\nRights, begin to address this problem.\n\nEven if we admit that the rule of law applies to international law,\nthere is a further question regarding the extent to which\ninternational law, in its current manifestation, complies with it\n(Lefkowitz 2020: 90\u201397). This is an immense topic, so it can\nonly be dealt with very cursorily here by reference to three problem\nareas pertaining to sources of law (custom), United Nations\ninstitutions (the UN Security Council), and one domain of law in which\nrule of law considerations have occasioned much controversy\n(international criminal law).\n5.3 Custom\n\nMany critics allege that customary international law, with its\nreliance on vaguely-specified levels and combinations of state\npractice and opinio juris, renders the existence and content\nof international legal norms highly indeterminate, thereby violating\nthe rule of law demand for notice and clarity (Goldsmith & Posner\n2005). Moreover, the process of reforming customary international law\nover time, which may involve states contravening existing customary\nnorms in order to give rise to new norms, violates the rule of law\nrequirement of congruence between law and official behaviour. Such\ncriticisms have spurred efforts to construct accounts of the formation\nof customary international law that secure greater determinacy and\nthat dispense with the need for violating existing custom in order to\nmake new custom. But an alternative view is that greater fidelity to\nthe rule of law requires that treaty law regimes should increasingly\ndisplace customary law (For contrasting views, see Bradley (ed.)\n2016).\n5.4 UN Security Council Resolutions\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly\u2019s Declaration on the Rule of\nLaw at the National and International Levels stipulates that\n\n\nthe rule of law applies to all States equally, and to international\norganizations, including the United Nations and its principal organs.\n(UN GA Res 67/1, 24 September 2012, para 2)\n\n\nBut there are notorious difficulties about the extent to which the UN\nSecurity Council, in particular, has complied with the international\nrule of law during the post-Cold War period when it has made\nresolutions \u201cto maintain or restore international peace and\nsecurity\u201d under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (see Crawford\n2014: Ch.XIII). The worry is that exercises of this power\u2014e.g.,\nto impose embargoes, authorize peace-keeping operations or military\nintervention, set up new rules on topics such as terrorism, establish\ncriminal tribunals etc\u2014is insufficiently regulated by law. Even\nif an argument can be made that the Security Council is bound not only\nby the UN Charter, but also by international law generally, a serious\nquestion remains as to the means of securing its compliance with such\nlaw. Is it enough that the legal validity of its resolutions is in\nprinciple justiciable if the issue properly arises in litigation\nbefore a court or tribunal? (ICJ 1971: p. 45, para. 88) Or should the\nICJ be given the general power to review UNSC resolutions as leading\nscholars have suggested (Franck 1995; Crawford & Marks 1998)?\nUltimately, there is an issue of ensuring adequate respect for the\nrule of law while giving the UN Security Council the flexibility to\nrespond effectively to any \u201cthreat to the peace, breach of the\npeace, or act of aggression\u201d (Art 39 UN Charter).\n5.5 International Criminal Law\n\nAs a newly emergent area of international law, one main concern about\ninternational criminal law\u2019s respect for the rule of law has\ntraditionally focused on whether it complies with the demand that\nindividuals should have fair warning that certain kinds of behaviour\nare criminally prohibited and attract liability to punishment. A\ndramatic illustration of this problem is the Nuremburg Trials, where\nit was questionable whether all of the grievous wrongs for which Nazi\ndefendants were tried were in fact criminally prohibited by\ninternational law at the time they were committed (Kelsen 1947: 171).\nOne response to these concerns is to argue that the wrongs in question\nwere so obviously evil, and the subjection of their perpetrators to\ncriminal trial and punishment so clearly justified and predictable,\nthat the obligation to give due notice did not have great weight\n(Luban 2010: 583\u2013587). To a significant degree, this problem has\nnow been addressed, both as a result of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which defines the crimes of genocide,\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, and\nassigns jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court, and as a\nresult of the evolution of counterpart norms in customary\ninternational law.\n\nYet a serious problem remains with another component of the rule of\nlaw, which is the congruence between official conduct and legal norms,\nensuring that like cases are treated alike and therefore that all\nprospective defendants are equal before the law. This is the scandal\nthat the defendants who stand trial for international crimes\noverwhelmingly come from the Global South rather than from the\npowerful North Atlantic democracies. This is deeply troubling, given\nthe great importance that the rule of law is typically thought to\npossess in the criminal law context, and has led even one expert to\nspeak of the \u201cdemise of international criminal law\u201d (Osiel\n2014\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n One can imagine various responses to this concern. One is that the\nabsence of a centralized global state whose arbitrary exercise of\nmassive power urgently needs to be reined in by law greatly diminishes\nthis rule of law blemish in the international case (Luban 2010:\n583\u2013587). Another is a more pragmatic response, according to\nwhich the edifice of international criminal justice must be patiently\nbuilt up, brick by brick, and that geographically skewed prosecutions\nhave their value, despite the cost incurred in transgressing the rule\nof law, as they are part of an ongoing effort to make international\ncriminal law more generally effective over time.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alston, Philip, 2017, \u201cThe Populist Challenge to Human\nRights\u201d, <em>Journal of Human Rights Practice</em>, 9(1):\n1\u201315. doi:10.1093/jhuman/hux007", "Annan, Kofi, 2004, <em>The Rule of Law and Transitional Justice in\nConflict and Post-Conflict Societies: Report of the\nSecretary-General</em>, New York: United Nations, UN doc.
