    "main_text": "Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers || Metaphilosophy\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAnalytic philosophy in Latin America has reached a considerable degree\nof originality and impact. The more stable democratic political\nregimes of the past forty years have also promoted research, freedom\nof expression, and critical thought. Globalization and new\ntechnologies have further contributed to this development.\n\nIn the early days, Latin American analytic philosophers were mostly\ninterested in interacting with their Anglo-Saxon peers. That relation\nwas usually asymmetric. In the last two decades or so, the situation\nhas started to change. Many Latin American analytic philosophers have\nstarted to strengthen their links with their Latin American peers and\nestablish more symmetric relations. The first steps were taken with\nthe organization of small workshops where Anglo-Saxon and Latin\nAmerican philosophers exchanged ideas and discussed each other\u2019s\nwork as equals. In 2006, the project of creating a regional\nassociation for analytic philosophy emerged in Mexico City, when Maite\nEzcurdia introduced the idea to other Latin American colleagues. As a\nresult, the Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Filosof\u00eda\nAnal\u00edtica (ALFAn) was created in 2007. ALFAn has so far\norganized six meetings in different countries. Additionally, it has\nongoing projects to mentor new generations of philosophers and\nincrease the discussion of analytic works produced within the\nregion.\n",
