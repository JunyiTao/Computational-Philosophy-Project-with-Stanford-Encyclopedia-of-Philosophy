Dispositions and Categorical Bases\n\nThe causal basis for \\(x\\)\u2019s disposition is something\nlike \\(x\\)\u2019s microstructural property that is or would be\ncausally responsible for the manifestation of that disposition. It\nwill be helpful to have in hand a characterisation of \u2018causal\nbasis\u2019 that is more perspicuous than this. In their seminal\npaper on dispositions, Prior, Pargetter & Jackson (1982) offer the\nfollowing definition (p. 251):\n\nPPJ. \nA causal basis for disposition \\(D\\) is the property or\nproperty-complex that, together with the characteristic stimulus\nof \\(D\\), is a causally operative sufficient condition for the\ncharacteristic manifestation of \\(D\\) in the case of\n\u201csurefire\u201d dispositions, and in the case of probabilistic\ndispositions is causally sufficient for the relevant chance of the\nmanifestation.\n\nWe will not here consider cases of probabilistic dispositions; the\n\u2018surefire\u2019 or deterministic cases are difficult enough. A\nclarification is needed of the concept of causally operative\nsufficient condition. One thing we can say for sure about it is that a\ncondition is causally operative sufficient for some\neffect only if, given the laws of nature, whenever the condition is\npresent it is causally necessary that the effect\noccurs. PPJ then entails the following account\nof causal basis: a causal basis for \\(D\\) is a property\nor property-complex \\(P\\) such that, given the laws of\nnature, whenever an\nobject \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) and undergoes the\ncharacteristic stimulus of \\(D\\), it is causally necessary\nthat \\(x\\) exhibits the characteristic manifestation\nof \\(D\\). Nolan (2015) suggests that a link between the\ncharacteristic stimulus and manifestation of \\(D\\) doesn\u2019t need\nto be a causal one, and then criticises PPJ on the ground\nthat it presupposes such a causal link. (For another criticism\nof PPJ, see Contessa 2012.)\n\nPPJ is not the only way to characterise the notion of\ncausal basis. Lewis (1997), for example, derives an alternative\ncharacterisation of causal basis from RCA, as pointed\nout by Hauska (2008a). The causal basis for \\(D\\) is\nthen approximately defined as an intrinsic\nproperty \\(P\\) that would cause \\(x\\) to\nmanifest \\(D\\) if \\(x\\) were to be\nexposed to the stimulus condition and, at the same\ntime, \\(x\\) were to retain \\(P\\) for a\nsufficient time. (For still alternative characterisations of causal\nbasis, see Mackie 1977, Johnston 1992, McKitrick 2003b, and Molnar\n2003.)\n\nNote that PPJ and Lewis\u2019s characterisation both\nleave it an open question whether the causal bases for a disposition\nneed be categorical properties, or instead a disposition might have a\ndisposition as a causal basis. Also it leaves it an open question\nwhether a disposition could serve as a causal basis for itself or not.\nThese open questions are the topic of the upcoming sections.\n",
