    "main_text": "Appraising Human Rationality\n8. Appraising Human Rationality\n\nThe rules of logic, the axioms of probability, the principles of\nutility theory\u2014humans flout them all, and do so as a matter of\ncourse. But are we irrational to do so? That depends on what being\nrational amounts to. For a Bayesian, any qualitative comparative\njudgment that does not abide by the axioms of probability is, by\ndefinition, irrational. For a baker, any recipe for bread that is\nequal parts salt and flour is irrational, even if coherent. Yet\nBayesians do not war with bakers. Why? Because bakers are satisfied\nwith the term \u2018inedible\u2019 and do not aspire to commandeer\n\u2018irrational\u2019.\n\nThe two schools of heuristics\n (section 7)\n reach sharply different conclusions about human rationality. Yet,\nunlike bakers, their disagreement involves the meaning of\n\u2018rationality\u2019 and how we ought to appraise human judgment\nand decision making. The \u201crationality wars\u201d are not the\nresult of \u201crhetorical flourishes\u201d concealing a broad\nconsensus (Samuels, Stich, & Bishop 2002), but substantive\ndisagreements\n (section 7.2)\n that are obscured by ambiguous use of terms like\n\u2018rationality\u2019.\n\nIn this section we first distinguish seven different notions of\nrationality, highlighting the differences in aim, scope, standards of\nassessment, and differences in the objects of evaluation. We then turn\nto consider two importantly different normative standards\nused in bounded rationality, followed by an example, the\nperception-cognition gap, illustrating how slight variations\nof classical experimental designs in the biases and heuristics\nliterature change both the results and the normative standards used to\nevaluate those results.\n",
