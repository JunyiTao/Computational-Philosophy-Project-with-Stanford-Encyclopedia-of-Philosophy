    "main_text": "Inadequate Descriptions\n2. Inadequate Descriptions\n\nIf we want to understand neoliberalism in terms of the ideas of those\ncommonly associated with it, and usages proposed by historians, we\nshould understand neoliberalism as a doctrine about how politics and\nthe economy should be organized. It is not a theory of justice or\nlegitimacy. Rather, neoliberals appeal to a plurality of moral\nconsiderations to justify their preferred institutions. We should also\navoid defining neoliberalism as fitting within any of the following\nfour categories. Neoliberalism should therefore not be identified as\n(\u00a72.1) an ethos or conception of the good life, (\u00a72.2) a\nschool of thought within utilitarianism, (\u00a72.3) a version of\nlibertarianism, or (\u00a72.4) an ideal theory.\n",
