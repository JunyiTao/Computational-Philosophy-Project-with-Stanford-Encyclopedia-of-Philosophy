Originally proposed by the Austrian\nFreidenkerbund (Free Thinker Association), the Verein Ernst Mach was\ndedicated to the dissemination of scientific ways of thought and so\nprovided a forum for popular lectures on the new scientific\nphilosophy. In the following year the Circle stepped out under its own\nname (invented by Neurath) with a manifesto and a special conference.\nThe publication of \u201cThe Scientific World Conception: The Vienna\nCircle\u201d, signed by Carnap, Hahn and Neurath and dedicated to\nSchlick, coincided with the \u201cFirst Conference for the\nEpistemology of the Exact Sciences\u201d in mid-September 1929,\norganised jointly with the Berlin Society as an adjunct to the Fifth\nCongress of German Physicists and Mathematicians in Prague (where\nFrank played a prominent role in the local organising committee). (On\nthe production history and early reception of the manifesto see Uebel\n2008.) A distinct philosophical school appeared to be emerging, one\nthat was dedicated to ending the previous disputes of philosophical\nschools by dismissing them, controversially, as strictly speaking\nmeaningless.\n\nThroughout the early and mid-1930s the Circle kept a high and\nincreasingly international profile with its numerous publications and\nconferences. In 1930, the Circle took over, again together with the\nBerlin Society, the journal Annalen der Philosophie and\nrestarted it under the name of Erkenntnis with Carnap and\nReichenbach as co-editors. (Besides publishing original articles and\nsustaining lengthy debates, this journal featured selected proceedings\nof their early conferences and documented the lecture series of the\nVerein Ernst Mach and the Berlin Society as well as their\ninternational congresses.) In addition, from 1928 until 1936, Schlick\nand Frank served as editors of their book series \u201cSchriften zur\nwissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung\u201d (\u201cWritings on the\nScientific World Conception\u201d), which published major works by\nleading members and early critics like Popper, while Neurath\nedited, from 1933 until 1939, the series\n\u201cEinheitswissenschaft\u201d (\u201cUnified Science\u201d),\nwhich published more introductory essays by leading members and\nsympathisers. Conference-wise, the Circle organized, again with the\nBerlin Society, a \u201cSecond Conference for the Epistemology of the\nExact Sciences\u201d as an adjunct to the Sixth Congress of German\nPhysicists and Mathematicians in K\u00f6nigsberg in September 1930\n(where Reidemeister played a prominent role in the organization and\nG\u00f6del first announced his incompleteness result in the\ndiscussion) and then began the series of International Congresses on\nthe Unity of Science with a \u201cPre-Conference\u201d just prior to\nthe start of the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy in Prague\nin September 1934. This, their last conference in Central Europe, was\nfollowed by the International Congresses of various sizes in Paris\n(September 1935, July 1937), Copenhagen (June 1936), Cambridge,\nEngland (July 1938), Cambridge, Mass. (September 1939), all in the\nmain organized by Neurath; a smaller last gathering was held in\nChicago in September 1941. By 1938 their collective publication\nactivity began to centre on a monumentally planned International\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science, with Neurath as editor-in-chief\nand Carnap and Charles Morris as co-editors; by the time of\nNeurath\u2019s death in 1945, only 10 monographs had appeared and the\nseries was wound up in 1970 numbering 20 monographs under the title\n\u201cFoundations of the Unity of Science\u201d (notably containing\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s Structure of Scientific Revolutions\namongst them).\n\nIndividually, the members of the Vienna Circle published extensively\nbefore, during and after the years of the Circle around Schlick. For\nsome (Frank, Hahn, Menger, Neurath), philosophy was only part of their\nscientific output, with numerous monographs and articles in their\nrespective disciplines (mathematics, physics and social science);\nothers (Schlick, Carnap, Feigl, Waismann) concentrated on philosophy,\nbut even their output cared relatively little for traditional concerns\nof the field. Here it must be noted that two early monographs by\nSchlick (1918/25) and Carnap (1928a), commonly associated with the\nVienna Circle, mostly predate their authors\u2019 participation there\nand exhibit a variety of influences not typically associated with\nlogical positivism (see section 3.7 below). Moreover, important\nmonographs by Frank (1932), Neurath (1931a), Carnap (1934/37) and\nMenger (1934) in the first half of the 1930s represent moves away from\npositions that had been held in the Circle before and contradict its\northodox profile. Yet the Circle\u2019s orthodoxy, as it were, is not\neasily pinned down either. Schlick himself was critical of the\nmanifesto of 1929 and gave a brief vision statement of his own in\n\u201cThe Turning Point in Philosophy\u201d (1930). A long-planned\nbook by Waismann of updates on Wittgenstein\u2019s thought, to which\nSchlick was extremely sympathetic, was never completed as originally\nplanned and only appeared posthumously (Waismann 1965; for earlier\nmaterial see Baker 2003). Comparison with rough transcripts of the\nCircle\u2019s discussions in the early 1930s (for transcripts from\nbetween December 1930 and July 1931 see Stadler 1997 [2015,\n69\u2013123]) suggest that Waismann\u2019s Wittgensteinian\n\u201cTheses\u201d, dated\nto \u201caround 1930\u201d (Waismann 1967 [1979, Appendix B]), come closest\nto an elaboration of the orthodox Circle position at that time (but\nwhich remained not undisputed even then). Again, what needs to be\nstressed is that all of the Circle\u2019s publications are to be\nunderstood as contributions to ongoing discussions among its members\nand associates.\n",
