    "main_text": "History of the Concept of Scientific Revolution || Scientific Revolution as a Topic for Philosophy\n2.2 Scientific Revolution as a Topic for Philosophy\n\nCommitment to the existence of deep scientific change does not, for\nall experts, equate to a commitment to the existence of revolutions in\nKuhn\u2019s sense. Consider the historically\u2013oriented\nphilosopher Stephen Toulmin (1953, 1961, 1972), who wrote of\n\u201cideals of natural order,\u201d principles so basic that they\nare normally taken for granted during an epoch but that are subject to\neventual historical change. Such was the change from the Aristotelian\nto the Newtonian conception of inertia. Yet Toulmin remained critical\nof revolution talk. Although the three influential college course\ntexts that he co-authored with June Goodfield recounted the major\nchanges that resulted in the development of several modern sciences\n(Toulmin and Goodfield 1961, 1962, 1965), these authors could write,\nalready about the so-called Copernican Revolution:\n\nWe must now look past the half-truths of this caricature, to what\nCopernicus attempted and what he in fact achieved. For in science, as\nin politics, the term \u2018revolution\u2019\u2014with its\nimplication that a whole elaborate structure is torn down and\nreconstructed overnight\u2014can be extremely misleading. In the\ndevelopment of science, as we shall see, thorough-going revolutions\nare just about out of the question. [1961, 164]\n\n\nThe Toulmin and Goodfield quotation invites us to ask, When did talk\nof scientific revolutions enter philosophy of science in a significant\nway? And the answer seems to be: there is a sprinkling of uses of the\nterm \u2018scientific revolution\u2019 and its cognates prior to\nKuhn, but these were ordinary expressions that did not yet have the\nstatus of a technical term.\n\nGiven the prominence of the topic today, it is surprising that we do\nnot find the term in Philipp Frank\u2019s account of the positivist\ndiscussion group in Vienna in the early twentieth century. However,\nFrank (1957) does speak of their perception of a \u201ccrisis\u201d\nin modern physics caused by the undermining of classical mechanics by\nspecial relativity and quantum mechanics, and it was common to speak\nof this or that worldview or world picture (Weltanschauung,\nWeltbild), e.g., the electromagnetic vs. the Einsteinian vs.\nthe mechanical picture. Nor do we find talk of scientific revolutions\nin the later Vienna Circle, even after the diaspora following the rise\nof Hitler. The technical term does not appear in Karl Popper\u2019s\nLogik der Forschung (1934) nor in his 1959 English expansion\nof that work as The Logic of Scientific Discovery, at least\nnot important enough to be indexed. Hans Reichenbach (1951) speaks\nrather casually of the revolutions in physics. The technical term is\nnot in Ernest Nagel\u2019s The Structure of Science (1961).\nNor is it in Stephen Pepper\u2019s World Hypotheses (1942).\nIt plays no significant role in N. R. Hanson\u2019s Patterns in\nDiscovery (1958), despite its talk of the theory-ladenness of\nobservation and perceptual Gestalt switches. Meanwhile, there were, of\ncourse, a few widely-read works in the background that spoke of major\nontological changes associated with the rise of modern science,\nespecially E. A. Burtt\u2019s Metaphysical Foundations of Modern\nPhysical Science (1924). Burtt\u2019s book influenced\nKoyr\u00e9, who, in turn, influenced Kuhn.\n\nIn his retrospective autobiographical lecture at Cambridge in 1953,\nPopper did refer to the dramatic political and intellectual events of\nhis youth as revolutionary:\n\n[T]he air was full of revolutionary slogans and ideas, and new and\noften wild theories. Among the theories which interested me\nEinstein\u2019s theory of relativity was no doubt by far the most\nimportant. The others were Marx\u2019s theory of history,\nFreud\u2019s psycho-analysis, and Alfred Adler\u2019s so-called\n\u2018individual psychology\u2019. [Popper 1957]\n\n\nAnd during the 1960s and 1970s, Popper indicated that, according to\nhis \u201ccritical approach\u201d to science and philosophy, all\nscience should be revolutionary\u2014revolution in permanence. But\nthis was a tame conception of revolution compared to Kuhn\u2019s,\ngiven Popper\u2019s two logical criteria for a progressive new\ntheory: (a) it must logically conflict with its predecessor and\noverthrow it; yet (b) \u201ca new theory, however revolutionary, must\nalways be able to explain fully the success of its predecessor\u201d\n(Popper 1975). As we shall see, Kuhn\u2019s model of revolution\nrejects both these constraints (depending on how one interprets his\nincommensurability claim) as well as the idea of progress toward\nfinal, big, theoretical truths about the universe. Kuhn dismissed\nPopper\u2019s notion of revolution in perpetuity as a contradiction\nin terms, on the ground that a revolution is something that overthrows\na long and well\u2013established order, in violation of the rules of\nthat order. Kuhn (1970) also vehemently rejected Popper\u2019s\ndoctrine of falsification, which implied that a theory could be\nrejected in isolation, without anything to replace it. According to\nPopper, at any time there may be several competing theories being\nproposed and subsequently refuted by failed empirical\ntests\u2014rather like several balloons being launched, over time,\nand then being shot down, one by one. Popper\u2019s view thus faces\nthe difficulty, among others, of explaining the long-term coherence\nthat historians find in scientific research.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, several philosophers and historians addressed\nthis difficulty by proposing the existence of larger units (than\ntheories) of and for analysis. Kuhn\u2019s paradigms, Imre\nLakatos\u2019s research programmes, Larry Laudan\u2019s research\ntraditions (Lakatos 1970, Laudan 1977), and the widespread use of\nterms such as \u2018conceptual scheme\u2019, \u2018conceptual\nframework\u2019, \u2018worldview\u2019, and Weltanschauung\n(Suppe 1974) instanced this felt need for larger-sized units among\nAnglo-American writers, as had Toulmin\u2019s old concept of ideals\nof natural order. These stable formations correspondingly raised the\neventual prospect of larger-scale instabilities, for an abrupt change\nin such a formation would surely be more dramatic, more revolutionary,\nthan a Popperian theory change. However, none of the other writers\nendorsed Kuhn\u2019s radical conception of scientific revolution.\nMeanwhile, Michel Foucault 1963, 1966, 1969, 1975), working in a\nFrench tradition, was positing the existence of \u201cdiscursive\nformations\u201d or epistemes, sets of deep-structural\ncultural rules that define the limits of discourse during a period.\nSection 5 returns to this theme.\n",
