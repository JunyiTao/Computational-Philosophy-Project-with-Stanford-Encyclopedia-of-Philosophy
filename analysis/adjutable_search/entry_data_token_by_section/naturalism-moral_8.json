    "main_text": "Objections to Naturalism || The Open Question Argument\n4.1 The Open Question Argument\n\nI said at the beginning of the article that contemporary metaethics\nbegan with G.E. Moore\u2019s rejection of moral naturalism. The\nargument that he deployed against naturalism is known as the Open\nQuestion Argument (OQA). The OQA is perhaps the most influential\nargument in metaethics, although today it is widely held to have\ncrippling flaws. Inevitably, this has inspired many critics of\nnaturalism to find ways to fix up or extend Moore\u2019s argument in\none way or another.\n\nExplaining Moore\u2019s argument is complicated by the fact that his\noriginal statement of the argument, in Sections 5\u201315\n(particularly 13\u201314) of Principia Ethica, is famously\nunclear. Moore himself admitted as much, in an unfinished forward to a\nsecond edition (Sinclair 2019). I won\u2019t engage in Moore exegesis\nhere. I\u2019ll just give a version of the OQA that most contemporary\nmetaethicists would recognize as \u201cthe Open Question\nArgument.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s OQA takes aim at theories of the form \u201cEverything\nthat is N is good,\u201d where \u2018N\u2019 is a\nbit of descriptive terminology that refers to a natural property, and\nwhere claims like this are true in virtue of the meanings of\n\u2018good\u2019 and \u2018N.\u2019 Moore is concerned\nwith goodness because he regards goodness as the most fundamental\nmoral concept, and holds that all moral inquiry is, in the end,\ninquiry into what sorts of things are good. And he\u2019s concerned\nwith theories that are true in virtue of meaning because he believes\nthat there are true claims of the form \u201cEverything that is\nN is good\u201d (for some potentially rather complicated\nN). He just denies that it is analytic that being N\nis the same thing as being good. \u201cIf I am right, then nobody can\nfoist upon us such an axiom as that \u2018Pleasure is the only\ngood\u2019 or that \u2018The good is the desired\u2019 on the\npretense that \u2018this is the very meaning of the\nword.\u2019\u201d (Moore 1903, Sec 6.)\n\nThe OQA relies on a test for theories of the form \u201cAll\nAs are Bs.\u201d The first step is to turn the\nstatement of the theory into a question: \u201cAll As are\nBs\u201d becomes \u201cGiven that x is A,\nis x also B?\u201d Some questions of this kind are\nclosed questions: one can know the answer simply by understanding the\nquestion. \u201cGiven that x is a bachelor, is x\nunmarried?\u201d is a closed question. Anyone who understands the\nmeanings of \u2018bachelor\u2019 and \u2018unmarried\u2019 is in a\nposition to see that the answer to that question must be yes. Anyone\nwho expressed doubt about that question must be incompetent with\neither the concept of bachelor or of unmarried. So\n\u201cAll bachelors are unmarried\u201d passes the test. That claim\nis true in virtue of the meanings of \u2018bachelor\u2019 and\n\u2018unmarried,\u2019 and so being unmarried is part of the essence\nof what it is to be a bachelor. Now consider the theory that pleasure\nis goodness. We can ask \u201cGranted that x is pleasurable,\nis x good?\u201d And this question is open. Someone can\nunderstand it perfectly and still reasonably doubt the answer. So the\ntheory that pleasure is goodness fails the open question test;\npleasure cannot be identical to goodness. The argument generalizes:\nFor any natural property N and any moral property M,\n\u201cGranted that x is N, is x\nM?\u201d will be an open question. Therefore, no moral\nproperty M is identical to any natural property\nN.\n\nThe most obvious problem with this argument is that it\u2019s not\nreally an argument against naturalism at all. It is, instead, an\nargument against analytic descriptivism. That is, it\u2019s an\nargument against the claim that there is some descriptive term\n\u2018N\u2019 that necessarily refers to a moral property\nM in virtue of the fact that there is a normative term\n\u2018M\u2019 that refers to M, and\n\u2018N\u2019 follows from a conceptual analysis of\n\u2018M\u2019 (Feldman 2005; Vessel 2020). But as we saw in\nSection 2.1, analytic descriptivism is not the same thing as\nnaturalism. Some naturalists are synthetic descriptivists, who hold\nthat \u2018N\u2019 necessarily refers to M, but\nthat this is established empirically rather than by conceptual\nanalysis (Brink 1989, Ch 6; Brink 2001). And one-term naturalists hold\nthat there is no descriptive term that necessarily refers to any moral\nproperty (Sturgeon 2003; V\u00e4yrynen 2021). The OQA has no force\nagainst either of these views. For these reasons, the common verdict\ntoday among metaethicists is that \u2013 unless it can be\nsubstantially modified or extended in some way \u2013 the OQA has no\nforce against naturalism.\n\nIn Moore\u2019s defense, even though he overlooked the possibility of\nsynthetic descriptivism and one-term naturalism, those views were not\nyet developed at the time he first outlined the OQA. Indeed, they were\ndeveloped by naturalist philosophers who recognized the force of the\nOQA against analytic descriptivism and so set out looking for other\nnaturalistic views that could evade the OQA. Rather than thinking of\nthese other naturalistic views as an oversight of Moore\u2019s, we\ncould just as easily give him credit for pointing others in their\ndirection.\n\nMost philosophers think that the OQA does succeed in refuting analytic\ndescriptivism, yet analytic descriptivists have developed several\nresponses to the OQA. One traditional response, from William Frankena\n(1939), says that the OQA begs the question. To an analytic\ndescriptivist who sincerely holds that, e.g., pleasure is the\ndefinition of goodness, the question \u201cGiven that X is\npleasurable, is it good?\u201d will seem closed. So whether that\nquestion is open or closed is precisely what is at issue, so Moore\nshouldn\u2019t claim that it is open without further argument.\nAnother traditional response appeals to the idea of the Paradox of\nAnalysis: if all analytic claims are obvious, then it\u2019s\nimpossible for there to be an interesting, informative conceptual\nanalysis. Since some conceptual analyses are interesting and\ninformative (we philosophers tell ourselves, desperately), not all\nanalytic claims are obvious. The OQA is a test of obvious analyticity,\nbut the correct definitions of moral terms might just be non-obvious\n(Smith 1994, 37\u201339). Another response begins from the\nobservation that Moore gives only a handful of examples of\nnaturalistic analyses and generalizes to the conclusion that any\nproposed analysis of moral terms must be wrong. That\u2019s an\nawfully hasty generalization. It\u2019s not clear that this worry can\nbe addressed by providing any finite number of additional failed\nanalyses. If \u2018goodness\u2019 (e.g.) can be analyzed, it can\npresumably be analyzed in one correct way, and all of the infinite\nother possible analyses are false. So the hypothesis that\n\u2018goodness\u2019 can be analyzed predicts that there are an\ninfinite number of incorrect analyses of \u2018goodness.\u2019 A\nhypothesis can\u2019t be refuted by data that it predicts, so even an\ninfinite number of incorrect analyses doesn\u2019t refute analytic\ndescriptivism (Finlay 2014, Ch 1).\n",
