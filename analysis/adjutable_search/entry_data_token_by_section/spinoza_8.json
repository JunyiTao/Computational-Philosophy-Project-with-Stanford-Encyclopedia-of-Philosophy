    "main_text": "Theological-Political Treatise || On Religion and Scripture\n3.1 On Religion and Scripture\n\nSpinoza begins the TTP by alerting his readers, through a kind of\n\u201cnatural history of religion\u201d, to just those superstitious\nbeliefs and behaviors that clergy, by playing on ordinary human\nemotions, encourage in their followers. A person guided by fear and\nhope, the main emotions in a life devoted to the pursuit of temporal\nadvantages, turns, in the face of the vagaries of fortune, to\nbehaviors calculated to secure the goods he desires. Thus, we pray,\nworship, make votive offerings, sacrifice and engage in all the\nvarious rituals of popular religion. But the emotions are as fleeting\nas the objects that occasion them, and thus the superstitions grounded\nin those emotions subject to fluctuations. Ambitious and self-serving\nclergy do their best to stabilize this situation and give some\npermanence to those beliefs and behaviors. \u201cImmense efforts have\nbeen made to invest religion, true or false, with such pomp and\nceremony that it can sustain any shock and constantly evoke the\ndeepest reverence in all its worshippers\u201d (TTP, Preface, G\nIII.6\u20137/S 2\u20133). Religious leaders are generally abetted in\ntheir purposes by the civil authority, which threatens to punish all\ndeviations from theological orthodoxy as \u201csedition\u201d. The\nresult is a state religion that has no rational foundations, a mere\n\u201crespect for ecclesiastics\u201d that involves adulation and\nmysteries but no true worship of God.\n\nThe solution to this state of affairs, Spinoza believes, is to examine\nthe Bible anew and find the doctrines of the \u201ctrue\nreligion\u201d. Only then will we be able to delimit exactly what we\nneed to do to show proper respect for God and obtain blessedness. This\nwill reduce the sway that religious authorities have over our\nemotional, intellectual and physical lives, and reinstate a proper and\nhealthy relationship between the state and religion. A close analysis\nof the Bible is particularly important for any argument that the\nfreedom of philosophizing\u2014essentially, freedom of thought and\nspeech\u2014is not prejudicial to piety. If it can be demonstrated\nthat Scripture is not a source of \u201cnatural truth\u201d, but the\nbearer of only a simple moral message (\u201cLove your\nneighbor\u201d), then people will see that \u201cfaith is something\nseparate from philosophy\u201d. Spinoza intends to show that in that\nmoral message alone\u2014and not in Scripture\u2019s words, origin\nor history\u2014lies the sacredness of what is otherwise merely a\nhuman document. The Bible teaches only \u201cobedience [to\nGod]\u201d, not knowledge. Thus, philosophy and religion, reason and\nfaith, inhabit two distinct and exclusive spheres, and neither should\ntread in the domain of the other. The freedom to philosophize and\nspeculate can therefore be granted without any harm to true religion.\nIn fact, such freedom is essential to public peace and piety, since\nmost civil disturbances arise from sectarian disputes. The real danger\nto a republic comes from those who would worship not God, but some\nwords on a page: \u201cIt will be said that, although God\u2019s law\nis inscribed in our hearts, Scripture is nevertheless the Word of God,\nand it is no more permissible to say of Scripture that it is mutilated\nand contaminated than to say this of God\u2019s Word. In reply, I\nhave to say that such objectors are carrying their piety too far, and\nare turning religion into superstition; indeed, instead of God\u2019s\nWord they are beginning to worship likenesses and images, that is,\npaper and ink\u201d (TTP, chap. 12, G III.159/S 145\u20136).\n\nFrom a proper and informed reading of Scripture, a number of things\nbecome clear. First, the prophets were not men of exceptional\nintellectual talents\u2014they were not, that is, naturally gifted\nphilosophers\u2014but simply very pious, even morally superior\nindividuals endowed with vivid imaginations. They were able to\nperceive God\u2019s revelation through their imaginative faculties\nvia words or real or imaginary figures. This is what allowed them to\napprehend that which lies beyond the boundary of the intellect.\nMoreover, the content of a prophecy varied according to the physical\ntemperament, imaginative powers, and particular opinions or prejudices\nof the prophet. It follows that prophecy, while it has its origins in\nthe power of God\u2014and in this respect it is, in Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysical scheme, no different from any other natural\nevent\u2014does not provide privileged knowledge of natural or\nspiritual phenomena. The prophets are not necessarily to be trusted\nwhen it comes to matters of the intellect, on questions of philosophy,\nhistory or science; and their pronouncements set no parameters on what\nshould or should not be believed about the natural world on the basis\nof our rational faculties.\n\nSpinoza provides an equally deflationary account of God\u2019s\nelection, or the \u201cvocation\u201d, of the Hebrews. It is\n\u201cchildish\u201d, he insists, for anyone to base their happiness\non the uniqueness of their gifts; in the case of the Jews, it would be\nthe uniqueness of their being chosen among all people. The ancient\nHebrews, in fact, did not surpass other nations in their wisdom or in\ntheir proximity to God. They were neither intellectually nor morally\nsuperior to other peoples. They were \u201cchosen\u201d only with\nrespect to their social organization and political good fortune. God\nor Nature gave them a set of laws (through a wise lawgiver, Moses),\nwhich they obeyed, and made their surrounding enemies weaker than\nthem. The natural result of this \u201cinternal\u201d and\n\u201cexternal\u201d aid is that their society was well-ordered and\ntheir autonomous government persisted for a long time. Their election\nwas thus a temporal and conditional one, and their kingdom is now long\ngone. Thus, \u201cat the present time there is nothing whatsoever\nthat the Jews can arrogate to themselves above other nations\u201d\n(TTP, chap. 3, G III.56/S 45). Spinoza thereby rejects the\nparticularism that many\u2014including Amsterdam\u2019s Sephardic\nrabbis\u2014insisted was essential to Judaism. True piety and\nblessedness are universal in their scope and accessible to anyone,\nregardless of their confessional creed.\n\nCentral to Spinoza\u2019s analysis of the Jewish\nreligion\u2014although it is applicable to any religion\nwhatsoever\u2014is the distinction between the divine law and the\nceremonial law. The law of God commands only the knowledge and love of\nGod and the actions required for attaining that condition. Such love\nmust arise not from fear of possible penalties or hope for any\nrewards, but solely from the goodness of its object. The divine law\ndoes not demand any particular rites or ceremonies such as\nsacrifices or dietary restrictions or festival observances. The six\nhundred and thirteen precepts of the Torah have nothing to do with\nblessedness or virtue. They were directed only at the Hebrews so that\nthey might govern themselves in an autonomous state. The ceremonial\nlaws helped preserve their kingdom and insure its prosperity, but were\nvalid only as long as that political entity lasted. They are not\nbinding on all Jews under all circumstances. They were, in fact,\ninstituted by Moses for a purely practical reason: so that people\nmight do their duty and not go their own way. This is true not just of\nthe rites and practices of Judaism, but of the outer ceremonies of all\nreligions. None of these activities have anything to do with true\nhappiness or piety. They serve only to control people\u2019s behavior\nand preserve a particular society.\n\nA similar practical function is served by stories of miracles.\nScripture speaks in a language suited to affect the imagination of\nordinary people and compel their obedience. Rather than appealing to\nthe natural and real causes of all events, its authors sometimes\nnarrate things in a way calculated to move people\u2014particularly\nuneducated people\u2014to devotion. \u201cIf Scripture were to\ndescribe the downfall of an empire in the style adopted by political\nhistorians, the common people would not be stirred \u2026\u201d\nStrictly speaking, however, miracles\u2014understood as divinely\ncaused departures from the ordinary course of nature\u2014are\nimpossible. Every event, no matter how extraordinary, has a natural\ncause and explanation. \u201cNothing happens in nature that does not\nfollow from her laws\u201d (TTP, chap. 6, G III.83/S 73). This is\nsimply a consequence of Spinoza\u2019s metaphysical doctrines.\nMiracles as traditionally conceived require a distinction between God\nand nature, something that Spinoza\u2019s philosophy rules out in\nprinciple. Moreover, nature\u2019s order is inviolable in so far as\nthe sequence of events in nature is a necessary consequence of\nGod\u2019s attributes. There certainly are \u201cmiracles\u201d in\nthe sense of events whose natural causes are unknown to us, and which\nwe therefore attribute to the powers of a supernatural God. But this\nis, once again, to retreat to superstition, \u201cthe bitter enemy of\nall true knowledge and true morality\u201d.\n\nBy analyzing prophecy in terms of vividness of imagination, Jewish\nelection as political fortune, the ceremonial law as a kind of social\nand political expediency, and the belief in miracles as an ignorance\nof nature\u2019s necessary causal operations, Spinoza naturalizes\n(and, consequently, demystifies) some of the fundamental elements of\nJudaism and other religions and undermines the foundations of their\nexternal, superstitious rites. At the same time, he thereby reduces\nthe fundamental doctrine of piety to a simple and universal formula,\nnaturalistic in itself, involving love and knowledge. This process of\nnaturalization achieves its stunning climax when Spinoza turns to\nconsider the authorship and interpretation of the Bible itself.\nSpinoza\u2019s views on Scripture constitute, without question, the\nmost radical theses of the Treatise, and explain why he was\nattacked with such vitriol by his contemporaries. Others before\nSpinoza had suggested that Moses was not the author of the entire\nPentateuch (for example, Abraham ibn Ezra in the twelfth century and,\nin the seventeenth century, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes).\nBut no one had taken that claim to the extreme limit that Spinoza did,\narguing for it with such boldness and at such length. Nor had anyone\nbefore Spinoza been willing to draw from it the conclusions about the\nstatus, meaning and interpretation of Scripture that Spinoza drew.\n\nSpinoza denied that Moses wrote all, or even most of the Torah. The\nreferences in the Pentateuch to Moses in the third person; the\nnarration of his death and, particularly, of events following his\ndeath; and the fact that some places are called by names that they did\nnot bear in the time of Moses all \u201cmake it clear beyond a shadow\nof doubt\u201d that the writings commonly referred to as \u201cthe\nFive Books of Moses\u201d were, in fact, written by someone who lived\nmany generations after Moses. Moses did, to be sure, compose some\nbooks of history and of law; and remnants of those long lost books can\nbe found in the Pentateuch. But the Torah as we have it, as well as as\nother books of the Hebrew Bible (such as Joshua, Judges, Samuel and\nKings) were written neither by the individuals whose names they bear\nnor by any person appearing in them. Spinoza believes that these were,\nin fact, all composed by a single historian living many generations\nafter the events narrated, and that this was most likely Ezra the\nScribe. It was the post-exilic leader who took the many writings that\nhad come down to him and began weaving them into a single (but not\nseamless) narrative. Ezra\u2019s work was later completed and\nsupplemented by the editorial labors of others. What we now possess,\nthen, is nothing but a compilation, and a rather mismanaged, haphazard\nand \u201cmutilated\u201d one at that.\n\nAs for the books of the Prophets, they are of even later provenance,\ncompiled (or \u201cheaped together\u201d, in Spinoza\u2019s view)\nby a chronicler or scribe perhaps as late as the Second Temple period.\nCanonization into Scripture occurred only in the second century BCE,\nwhen the Pharisees selected a number of texts from a multitude of\nothers. Because the process of transmission was a historical one,\ninvolving the conveyance of writings of human origin over a long\nperiod of time through numerous scribes, and because the decision to\ninclude some books but not others was made by fallible human beings,\nthere are good reasons for believing that a significant portion of the\ntext of the \u201cOld Testament\u201d is corrupt.\n\nWhile in 1670 there was nothing novel in claiming that Moses did not\nwrite all of the Torah, Spinoza\u2019s remarkably innovative claim\nwas to argue that this holds great significance for how Scripture is\nto be read and interpreted. He was dismayed by the way in which\nScripture itself was worshipped, by the reverence accorded to the\nwords on the page rather than to the message they conveyed. If the\nBible is an historical (i.e., natural) document, then it should be\ntreated like any other work of nature. The study of Scripture, or\nBiblical hermeneutics, should therefore proceed as the study of\nnature, or natural science, proceeds: by gathering and evaluating\nempirical data, that is, by examining the \u201cbook\u201d\nitself\u2014along with the contextual conditions of its\ncomposition\u2014for its general principles.\n\nI hold that the method of interpreting Scripture is no different from\nthe method of interpreting Nature, and is in fact in complete accord\nwith it. For the method of interpreting Nature consists essentially in\ncomposing a detailed study of Nature from which, as being the source\nof our assured data, we can deduce the definitions of the things of\nNature. Now in exactly the same way the task of Scriptural\ninterpretation requires us to make a straightforward study of\nScripture, and from this, as the source of our fixed data and\nprinciples, to deduce by logical inference the meaning of the authors\nof Scripture. In this way\u2014that is, by allowing no other\nprinciples or data for the interpretation of Scripture and study of\nits contents except those that can be gathered only from Scripture\nitself and from a historical study of Scripture\u2014steady progress\ncan be made without any danger of error, and one can deal with matters\nthat surpass our understanding with no less confidence than those\nmatters that are known to us by the natural light of reason. (TTP,\nchap. 7, G III.98/S 87).\n\n\nJust as the knowledge of nature must be sought from nature alone, so\nmust the knowledge of Scripture\u2014an apprehension of its intended\nmeaning\u2014be sought from Scripture alone and through the\nappropriate exercise of rational and textual inquiry.\n\nWhen properly interpreted, the universal message conveyed by Scripture\nis a simple moral one: \u201cTo know and love God, and to love\none\u2019s neighbor as oneself\u201d. This is the real word\nof God and the foundation of true piety, and it lies uncorrupted in a\nfaulty, tampered and corrupt text. The lesson involves no metaphysical\ndoctrines about God or nature, and requires no sophisticated training\nin philosophy. In contrast with Maimonides\u2019 account, Spinoza\ninsists that the object of Scripture is not to impart truth or\nknowledge, but to compel obedience and regulate our conduct.\n\u201cScriptural doctrine contains not abstruse speculation or\nphilosophic reasoning, but very simple matters able to be understood\nby the most sluggish mind\u201d (TTP, chap. 13, G III.167/S 153). To\nthe extent (and only to the extent) that Scripture is successful in\nmorally edifying its readers and inspiring them to obey the word of\nGod and treat others with justice and charity, it is\n\u201cdivine\u201d. Spinoza claims, in fact, that a familiarity with\nScripture is not even necessary for piety and blessedness, since its\nmessage can be known by our rational faculties alone, although with\ngreat difficulty for most people. \u201cHe who, while unacquainted\nwith these writings, nevertheless knows by the natural light that\nthere is a God having the attributes we have recounted, and who also\npursues a true way of life, is altogether blessed.\u201d\n\nIt follows that the only practical commandments that properly belong\nto religion are those that are necessary to carry out the moral\nprecept and \u201cconfirm in our hearts the love of our\nneighbor\u201d. \u201cA catholic faith should therefore contain only\nthose dogmas which obedience to God absolutely demands, and without\nwhich such obedience is absolutely impossible \u2026 these must all\nbe directed to this one end: that there is a Supreme Being who loves\njustice and charity, whom all must obey in order to be saved, and must\nworship by practicing justice and charity to their neighbor\u201d\n(TTP, chap. 14, G III.177/S 161\u20132). As for other dogmas,\n\u201cevery person should embrace those that he, being the best judge\nof himself, feels will do most to strengthen in him love of\njustice\u201d.\n\nThis is the heart of Spinoza\u2019s case for toleration, for freedom\nof philosophizing and freedom of religious expression. By reducing the\ncentral message of Scripture\u2014and the essential content of\npiety\u2014to a simple moral maxim, one that is free of any\nsuperfluous speculative doctrines or ceremonial practices; and by\nfreeing Scripture of the burden of having to communicate specific\nphilosophical truths or of prescribing (or proscribing) a multitude of\nrequired behaviors, he has demonstrated both that philosophy is\nindependent from religion and that the liberty of each individual to\ninterpret religion as he wishes can be upheld without any detriment to\npiety.\n\nAs to the question of what God, the exemplar of true life, really is,\nwhether he is fire, or spirit, or light, or thought, or something\nelse, this is irrelevant to faith. And so likewise is the question as\nto why he is the exemplar of true life, whether this is because he has\na just and merciful disposition, or because all things exist and act\nthrough him and consequently we, too, understand through him, and\nthrough him we see what is true, just and good. On these questions it\nmatters not what beliefs a man holds. Nor, again, does it matter for\nfaith whether one believes that God is omnipresent in essence or in\npotency, whether he directs everything from free will or from the\nnecessity of his nature, whether he lays down laws as a rule or\nteaches them as being eternal truths, whether man obeys God from free\nwill or from the necessity of the divine decree, whether the rewarding\nof the good and the punishing of the wicked is natural or\nsupernatural. The view one takes on these and similar questions has no\nbearing on faith, provided that such a belief does not lead to the\nassumption of greater license to sin, or hinders submission to God.\nIndeed \u2026 every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious\ndogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in\nwhatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them\nwith full confidence and conviction. (TTP, chap. 14, G III.164/S\n162\u20133)\n\n\nFaith and piety belong not to the person who has the most rational\nargument for the existence of God or the most thorough philosophical\nunderstanding of his attributes, but to the person \u201cwho best\ndisplays works of justice and charity\u201d.\n",
