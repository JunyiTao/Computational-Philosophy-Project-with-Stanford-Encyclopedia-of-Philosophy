    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Pluralism and Tolerance\n1.3 Pluralism and Tolerance\n\nCarnap differed from the philosophical tradition not only in his\nsuspicion of ordinary language and its potentially misleading\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d artifacts, and in his engineering impulse\nto replace our inherited languages by better-constructed and more\nprecise constructed linguistic frameworks, but also in his\nincreasingly pronounced pluralism among frameworks. In the\nAufbau, Carnap had already discussed the availability of\ndifferent frameworks (phenomenalist, physicalist, and more), and how\nthey were more or less suitable for different purposes (see the\nsupplement on\n Aufbau).\n But these frameworks still differed only in the choice of non-logical\nprimitives and in the definition of non-primitive terms\u2014the\nframeworks were still based on the same syntactic formation rules and\non one and the same logical system. As far as the explicit endorsement\nof syntactic and logical pluralism and tolerance is concerned, the\nturning point came in 1932, while Carnap was writing his book (now\noften considered his masterpiece) Logical Syntax of Language.\nThe starting point of that book, as we will see in more detail in\n section 4\n below, had been strongly motivated by the search for a single\nstandard language of science. But this was now combined with\nCarnap\u2019s new idea that, for philosophical statements\nabout science, the standard of communicative acceptability\nshould not (as in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus) be that it\nhave meaning (that it picture some state of affairs), but\nthat it be translatable into the \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d.\nHis criterion for the scientific (non-metaphysical) status of a\nphilosophical statement, that is, had shifted from the reducibility of\na sentence to \u201catomic\u201d observation sentences to its\nexpressibility as a statement solely about linguistic artifacts\n(rather than about the supposed things and processes they refer to).\nBut Carnap had still thought, until late 1932, that a single standard\nlanguage for logical syntax could be found, and had invested a lot of\ntime in devising such a language system. At that point, however, two\nsets of controversies attracted attention: the so-called\n\u201cprotocol sentence debate\u201d about the correct form of\nobservation sentences (and by implication, the role of observation in\nscience), and the dispute about the foundations of mathematics among\nthe three schools of logicism, intuitionism, and formalism. Both these\ncontroversies came to seem to Carnap, after years of involvement in\neach of them, to stumble over artifacts of inherited language just\nlike the old philosophical problems the Vienna Circle thought it had\nswept away. He came to regard the different positions in these debates\nnot as potentially \u201cright\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d (or\n\u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d) but as different\nproposals for language frameworks in which to frame the questions,\ndifferent ways of articulating the problems surrounding empirical\nevidence and the nature of mathematics, respectively. And it seemed to\nhim that these proposals were mostly not mutually exclusive; on the\ncontrary, he came to think that many different alternative languages\nshould be pursued and developed to see how well they perform in\ndifferent contexts. He saw them as motivated by different needs and\nrequirements, perhaps by different ultimate values, and he thought the\ndiscussion of values should not be confused with the study and\ndevelopment of the language frameworks themselves: \u201cin\nlogic\u201d, he famously wrote in the Syntax (LSS:\n\u00a717), \u201cthere are no morals\u201d.\n\nThis new pluralism undermined the initial premise of the\nSyntax book on which he was working then, but Carnap\nnonetheless took it on board. The language he had initially been\nintending to propose as the single standard language of science was\nnow used simply as an example, and to be sure that it wasn\u2019t\ntaken too prescriptively Carnap also developed another language\n(Dr.-Seuss-like, he called them \u201cLanguage I\u201d and\n\u201cLanguage II\u201d), and stressed that both were acceptable,\nthough each had its strengths and weaknesses for different purposes.\nThe new linguistic pluralism was stated as the\n\n\nprinciple of tolerance: we are not in the business of setting up\nprohibitions but of arriving at conventions\u2026 In logic\nthere are no morals. Everyone is welcome to set up his logic,\ni.e., his form of language, as he pleases. If he wants to discuss it\nwith us, though, he needs to state his intentions clearly, and give\nsyntactical specifications rather than philosophical debates. (LSS:\n\u00a717)\n\n\nThis principle would remain a permanent, indeed the dominant,\ncomponent of Carnap\u2019s philosophy for the rest of his career. For\nmore details on Carnapian tolerance, see the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Sections 1 and 2).\n",
