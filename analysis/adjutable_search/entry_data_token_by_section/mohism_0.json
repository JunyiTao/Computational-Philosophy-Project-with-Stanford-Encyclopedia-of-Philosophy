    "main_text": "Mozi and the Mohists\n1. Mozi and the Mohists\n\n\nMohism springs from the teachings of Mo Di, or Mozi (\u201cMaster\nMo\u201d),[1]\n about whom little is known, not even what\nstate he was from. The Shi Ji, a Han dynasty record, tells us\nonly that he was an official of the state of Song and that he lived\neither at the same time as or after Confucius (d. 479 BCE), with whom\nhe is often paired by Qin (221\u2013206 BCE) and Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013219\nCE) texts as the two great moral teachers of the Warring States era.\nMost likely, he flourished during the middle to late decades of the 5th\ncentury BCE, roughly contemporaneous with Socrates in the West.\n\u2018Mo\u2019 is an unusual surname and the common Chinese word for\n\u201cink.\u201d Hence scholars have speculated that the name may have been an epithet referring to the dark or tattooed skin of a laborer or convict or a transliteration from a non-Chinese language. However, \u2018Mo\u2019 could simply have been an uncommon ancient surname that later ceased to be used.\n\n\nA strong argument can be made that it is Mozi, not Confucius, who\ndeserves the title of China\u2019s first philosopher. Before the rise of the\nMohist school, Ru or so-called\n \u201cConfucian\u201d[2]\n thought seems to have consisted mostly of wise aphorisms offering\nmoral coaching aimed at developing virtuous performers of social roles\nas described in traditional li (norms of ritual\npropriety). Mozi and his followers were the first in the Chinese\ntradition to point out that conformity to traditional mores in itself\ndoes not ensure that actions are morally right. This critical insight\nmotivated a self-conscious search for\n objective moral standards,\n by which the Mohists hoped to unify the moral judgments of everyone in\nsociety, thus eliminating social disorder and ensuring that morality\nprevailed.  The normative standard through which they proposed to\nachieve these aims was the \u201cbenefit (l\u00ec) of all \nthe world\u201d: Actions, practices, and policies that promote the\noverall welfare of society were to be considered morally right, those\nthat interfere with it morally wrong. This consequentialist standard was\njustified by appeal to the intention of Heaven (Tian),\na sky or nature deity that the Mohists claimed is committed impartially to\nthe benefit of all. Heaven\u2019s intention provides a reliable epistemic\ncriterion for moral judgment, they held, because Heaven is the wisest\nand noblest agent in the cosmos. This basic consequentialist and religious\nframework motivated a set of\n ten core ethical and political doctrines,\n which the Mohists sought to persuade the rulers of their day to put into\npractice. This article will discuss the\n motivation\n for the Mohist philosophical and\npolitical project, the central\n epistemic\nand\n logical\n notions that structure Mohist thought,\nand the details of the Mohists\u2019\n ethical\n and\n political\n doctrines, including their strengths\nand weaknesses.\n\n\nOur primary source for the thought of Mozi and his followers is a\ncorpus of anonymously authored texts collected into a book called the\nMozi. Other, less direct sources include anecdotes and\ncomments about the Mohists preserved in early texts such as the\nLushi Chunqiu, Hanfeizi, Zhuangzi, and\nHuainanzi and criticisms of them by two of their major\nopponents, the Confucians Mencius (ca. 372\u2013289 BCE) and Xunzi (fl.\n289\u2013238 BCE). The Mozi is a diverse compilation of polemical\nessays, short dialogues, anecdotes about Mozi, and compact\nphilosophical discussions, the different parts of the book ranging in\ndate from the 5th to the 3rd century BCE. For a detailed discussion of\nthe organization, nature, and authorship of the Mozi, see the\nfollowing supplement:\nTexts and Authorship\n\n\nThe Mohist texts provide only the barest handful of clues about\nMozi\u2019s life. One passage depicts King Hui of Chu (488\u2013432 BCE)\nrefusing to grant him an audience because of his low social status.\nSeveral anecdotes in the Mozi and other early texts depict him\nas a master craftsman and military engineer. The Huainanzi, a\nHan dynasty text, claims that Mozi was an apostate Ru\n(Confucian), but the Mozi itself provides no particular reason\nto believe this. A more likely conjecture, supported by the frequency\nof references to the crafts in Mohist texts, is that he was originally\nan artisan of some kind, probably a carpenter. Indeed, the many\nexamples alluding to crafts, mechanics, trade, work, and economic\nhardship, the apparent \u201ccritical outsider\u201d stance of the earliest\nMohist texts, and the nearly total absence of references to the\nli (courtly ritual, ceremony, etiquette) so central to\nConfucian thought all tend to suggest that Mohism emerged from a rising\nclass of craftsmen, merchants, and soldiers that grew in size and\npolitical influence during the Warring States era, a time of rapid\nsocial and political change. For an exploration of the impact of this\nsocial background on Mohist thought, see the following supplement:\n\nInfluence of Social Origins on Mohist Thought\n\n\n\nAs their movement flourished in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, the\nMohists branched into a number of groups, each led by a juzi,\nor grand master. Two early sources, the Hanfeizi (Book 50, ca.\n233 BCE or later) and the Zhuangzi (Book 33, perhaps 2nd\ncentury BCE), mention a total of six groups of Mohists, who apparently\nquarreled among themselves over the details of Mohist doctrine. Another\nearly text, the Lushi Chunqiu (ca. 239 BCE), mentions at\nleast three other Mohist juzi. Evidence from the Mozi\nand Lushi Chunqiu indicates that these Mohist groups were\ndisciplined organizations devoted to moral and practical education,\npolitical advocacy, government service, and in some cases military\nservice. Members underwent a period of study and training, after which\nthe organization might find them positions in government or the\nmilitary, probably in a Mohist regiment. Members were expected to\ncontribute funds to the organization and could be expelled for failing\nto fulfill their duties. The Mohists were renowned for fervent\ncommitment to their ethical principles and to a lifestyle of austerity\nand self-sacrifice. A Han dynasty text collected in the\nZhuangzi claims that many Mohists believed it was their duty\nto emulate the legendary altruistic labors of the ancient sage king\nYu:\nMany of the Mohists of later ages\nwear furs and rough clothing, clogs and grass slippers, never resting\nday or night, taking self-sacrifice as the highest. They say, \u201cOne who\ncannot do this is not following the way of Yu and doesn\u2019t deserve to\nbe called a Mohist.\u201d \u2026 They press each other forward in\nself-sacrifice until there\u2019s no flesh left on their calves or hair on\ntheir shins. (Zhuangzi, Book 33, \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d)\n\n\nSuch external testimony \u2014 albeit from an unsympathetic source\n\u2014 presents a minor puzzle in the interpretation of Mohist\nthought, for the texts preserved in the Mozi do not directly\nadvocate self-sacrificing altruism, and at least one clearly rejects\nit. The same Zhuangzi passage tells us that different groups\nof Mohists disagreed strongly concerning the details of Mohist\ndoctrine; perhaps this was one of the issues about which they\ndiffered.\n\n\nAs the name implies, the Warring States era saw the pre-imperial Chinese world divided into\nnumerous states that frequently fell to war with each other, each of\nthe larger, more powerful states aspiring to conquer its neighbors and\nunify the empire under its rule. The Mohists were deeply committed to\nthe ideal of a harmonious, peaceful social order and to universal\nconcern for the welfare of all the world. They condemned\nunprovoked military aggression and attempted to dissuade warlike rulers\nfrom attacking other states. Far from being pacifists, however, they\nsaw a strong defense force as crucial to state survival. Indeed, many\nMohists seem to have concluded that, since social order was a paramount\nvalue and gratuitous warfare was wrong, they had a duty to assist\nvictims of aggression. Some Mohists became specialists in defensive\nwarfare, rushing to the aid of cities and states under threat of\nattack. The last quarter of the Mozi preserves the texts of\nthese militias, which present detailed information about ancient\ndefense tactics and siege fortifications (for an overview, see Yates,\n1980).\n",
