    "main_text": "The Suppositional Theory || Validity\n3.2 Validity\n\nErnest Adams, in two articles (1965, 1966) and a subsequent book\n(1975), gave a theory of the validity of arguments involving\nconditionals as construed by Supp. He taught us something important\nabout classically valid arguments as well: that they are, in a special\nsense to be made precise, probability-preserving. This property can be\ngeneralized to apply to arguments with conditionals. The valid ones\nare those which, in the special sense, preserve probability or\nconditional probability. \n\nFirst consider classically valid (that is, necessarily\ntruth-preserving) arguments which don\u2019t involve conditionals. We\nuse them in arguing from contingent premises about which we are often\nless than completely certain. The question arises: how certain can we\nbe of the conclusion of the argument, given that we think, but are not\nsure, that the premises are true? Call the improbability of a\nstatement one minus its probability. Adams showed this: if (and only\nif) an argument is valid, then in no probability distribution does the\nimprobability of its conclusion exceed the sum of the improbabilities\nof its premises. Call this the Probability Preservation Principle\n(PPP).\n\nThe proof of PPP rests on the Partition Principle \u2014 that the\nprobabilities of the members of a partition sum to 100% \u2014\nnothing else, beyond the fact that if \\(A\\) entails \\(B, \\mathbf{p}(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B) = 0\\). Here are three consequences:\n\nif \\(A\\) entails \\(B, \\mathbf{p}(A) \\le \\mathbf{p}(B)\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\text{ or } B) = \\mathbf{p}(A) + \\mathbf{p}(B) -\n\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B) \\le \\mathbf{p}(A) + \\mathbf{p}(B)\\)\nFor all \\(n, \\mathbf{p}(A_1\\) or \u2026 or \\(A_n) \\le\n\\mathbf{p}(A_1) + \\cdots + \\mathbf{p}(A_n)\\)\n\n\nSuppose \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) entail \\(B\\). Then \\({\\sim}B\\) entails\n\\({\\sim}A_1\\) or \u2026 or \\({\\sim}A_n\\). Therefore\n\\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}B) \\le \\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A_1) + \\cdots +\n\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A_n)\\): the improbability of the conclusion of a\nvalid argument cannot exceed the sum of the improbabilities of the\npremises. \n\nThe result is useful to know: if you have two premises of which you\nare at least 99% certain, they entitle you to be at least 98% certain\nof a conclusion validly drawn from them. Of course, if you have 100\npremises each at least 99% certain, your conclusion may have zero\nprobability. That is the lesson of the \u201cLottery Paradox\u201d.\nStill, Adams\u2019s result vindicates deductive reasoning from\nuncertain premises, provided that they are not too uncertain, and\nthere are not too many of them.\n\nSo far, we have a very useful consequence of the classical notion of\nvalidity. Now Adams extends this consequence to arguments involving\nconditionals. Take a language with \u201cand\u201d,\n\u201cor\u201d, \u201cnot\u201d and \u201cif\u201d \u2014 but\nwith \u201cif\u201d occurring only as the main connective in a\nsentence. (We put aside compounds of conditionals.) Take any argument\nformulated in this language. Consider any probability function over\nthe sentences of this argument which assigns non-zero probability to\nthe antecedents of all conditionals \u2014 that is, any assignment of\nnumbers to the non-conditional sentences which conforms to the\nPartition Principle, and to the conditional sentences which conforms\nto Supp\u2019s thesis: \\(\\mathbf{p}(B\\) if \\(A) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B) =\n\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B)/\\mathbf{p}(A)\\). Let the improbability of the\nconditional \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d be \\(1 - \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\).\nDefine a valid argument as one such that there is no\nprobability function in which the improbability of the conclusion\nexceeds the sum of the improbabilities of the premises. And a nice\nlogic emerges, which is now well known. It is the same as\nStalnaker\u2019s logic over this domain (see \u00a74.1). There are\nrules of proof, a decision procedure, consistency and completeness can\nbe proved. See Adams (1998 and 1975).\n\nI shall write the conditional which satisfies Adams\u2019s criterion\nof validity \u201c\\(A \\Rightarrow B\\)\u201d.\nWe have already seen that in all distributions, \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B) \\le\n\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B)\\). Therefore, \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) entails \\(A\n\\supset B\\): it cannot be the case that the former is more probable\nthan the latter. Call a non-conditional sentence a factual sentence.\nIf an argument has a factual conclusion, and is classically valid with\nthe conditional interpreted as \\(\\supset\\), it is valid with the\nconditional interpreted as the stronger \\(\\Rightarrow\\). The following\npatterns of inference are therefore valid: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA; A \\Rightarrow B; &\\text{ so } B \\text{ (modus ponens)}  \\\\\nA \\Rightarrow B; {\\sim}B; &\\text{ so } {\\sim}A \\text{ (modus tollens)} \\\\\nA \\text{ or } B; A \\Rightarrow C; B \\Rightarrow C; &\\text{ so } C.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWe cannot consistently have their premises highly probable and their\nconclusion highly improbable. \n\nArguments with conditional conclusions, however, may be valid when the\nconditional is interpreted as the weaker \\(A \\supset B\\), but invalid\nwhen it is interpreted as the stronger \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\). Here are\nsome examples. \n\n\\[\nB; \\text{ so } A \\Rightarrow B.\n\\]\n\n\nI can consistently be close to certain that Sue is lecturing right\nnow, while thinking it highly unlikely that if she had a heart attack\non her way to work, she is lecturing just now. \n\n\\[\n{\\sim}A; \\text{ so } A \\Rightarrow B.\n\\]\n\n\nYou can consistently be close to certain that the Republicans\nwon\u2019t win, while thinking it highly unlikely that if they win\nthey will double income tax. \n\n\\[\n{\\sim}(A \\amp B); \\text{ so } A \\Rightarrow{\\sim}B\n\\]\n\n\nI can consistently be close to certain that it\u2019s not the case\nthat I will be hit by a bomb and injured today, while thinking it\nhighly unlikely that if I am hit by a bomb, I won\u2019t be\ninjured. \n\n\\[\nA \\text{ or } B; \\text{ so } {\\sim}A \\Rightarrow B.\n\\]\n\n\nAs I think it is very likely to rain tomorrow, I think it\u2019s very\nlikely to be true that it will rain or snow tomorrow. But I think\nit\u2019s very unlikely that if it doesn\u2019t rain, it will\nsnow. \n\n\\[\nA \\Rightarrow B; \\text{ so } (C \\amp A)  \\Rightarrow B\n\\text{ (strengthening of the antecedent).}\n\\]\n\n\nI can think it\u2019s highly likely that if you strike the match, it\nwill light; but highly unlikely that if you dip it in water and strike\nit, it will light. \n\nStrengthening is a special case of transitivity, in which the missing\npremise is a tautology: if \\(C \\amp A\\) then \\(A\\); if \\(A, B\\); so if\n\\(C \\amp A, B\\). So transitivity also fails: \n\n\\[\nA \\Rightarrow B; B \\Rightarrow C; \\text{ so } A \\Rightarrow C.\n\\]\n\n\nAdams gave this example (1966): I can think it highly likely that if\nJones is elected, Brown will resign immediately afterwards; I can also\nthink it highly likely that if Brown dies before the election, Jones\nwill be elected; but I do not think it at all likely that if Brown\ndies before the election, Brown will resign immediately after the\nelection! \n\nWe saw in \u00a72.2 that Conditional Proof (CP) is invalid for any\nconditional stronger than \\(\\supset\\). It is invalid in Adams\u2019s\nlogic. For instance, \u201c\\({\\sim}(A \\amp B)\\); \\(A\\); so\n\\({\\sim}B\\)\u201d is valid. It contains no conditionals. Any\nnecessarily truth-preserving argument satisfies PPP. If I\u2019m\nclose to certain that I won\u2019t be hit by a bomb and injured,\nand close to certain that I will be hit by a bomb, then I\nmust be close to certain that I won\u2019t be injured. But, as we\nsaw, \u201c\\({\\sim}(A \\amp B)\\); so \\(A \\Rightarrow{\\sim}B\\)\u201d\nis invalid. Yet we can get the latter from the former by CP.\n\nWhy does CP fail on this conception of conditionals? After all,\nSupp\u2019s idea is to treat the antecedent of a conditional as an\nassumption. What is the difference between the roles of a\npremise, and of the antecedent of a conditional in the conclusion?\n\nThe antecedent of the conditional is indeed treated as an assumption.\nOn this conception of validity, the premises are not, primarily,\ntreated as assumptions. We also make inferences from beliefs,\nincluding beliefs which are less than certain. Indeed, it is not\nimmediately clear what it would be to treat a conditional, construed\naccording to Supp, as an assumption: to assume something, as\nordinarily understood, is to assume that it is true; and conditionals\nare not being construed as ordinary statement of fact. But we could\napproximate the idea of taking the premises as assumptions, by\ntreating them, hypothetically, as certainties. Treating the premises\nthus would be to require of a valid argument that it preserve\ncertainty: that there must be no probability distributions in which\nall the premises (conditional or otherwise) are assigned probability 1\nand the conclusion is assigned probability less than 1. Call this the\ncertainty-preservation principle (CPP).\n\nThe conception of validity we have been using (PPP) takes as central\nthe fact that premises may be accepted with degrees of confidence less\nthan certainty. Now, anything which satisfies PPP satisfies CPP. And\nfor argument involving only factual propositions, the converse is also\ntrue: the same class of arguments necessarily preserves truth,\nnecessarily preserves certainty and necessarily preserves probability\nin the sense of PPP. But arguments involving conditionals can satisfy\nCPP without satisfying PPP. The invalid argument forms above do\npreserve certainty: if you assign probability 1 to the premises, then\nyou are constrained to assign probability 1 to the conclusion (in all\nprobability distributions in which the antecedent of any conditional\ngets non-zero probability). But they do not preserve high probability.\nThey do not satisfy PPP. If at least one premise falls short of\ncertainty by however small an amount, the conclusion can plummet to\nzero.\n\nThe logico-mathematical fact behind this is the difference in logical\npowers between \u201cAll\u201d and \u201cAlmost all\u201d. If all\n\\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds (and there are some \\(C \\amp A\\)-worlds)\nthen all \\(C \\amp A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds. But we can have: almost\nall \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds but no \\(C \\amp A\\)-world is a\n\\(B\\)-world. If all \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds and all \\(B\\)-worlds\nare \\(C\\)-worlds, then all \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(C\\)-worlds. But we can\nhave: all \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds, almost all \\(B\\)-worlds are\n\\(C\\)-worlds, yet no \\(A\\)-world is a \\(C\\)-world; just as we can\nhave, all kiwis are birds, almost all birds fly, but no kiwi\nflies.\n\nSomeone might react as follows: \u201cAll I want of a valid argument\nis that it preserve certainty. I\u2019m not bothered if an argument\ncan have premises close to certain and a conclusion far from certain,\nas long as the conclusion is certain when the premises are\ncertain\u201d.\n\nWe could use the word \u201cvalid\u201d in such a way that\nan argument is valid provided it preserves certainty. If our interest\nin logic is confined to its application to mathematics or other a\npriori matters, that is fine. Further, when our arguments do not\ncontain conditionals, if we have certainty-preservation,\nprobability-preservation comes free. But if we use conditionals when\narguing about contingent matters, then great caution will be required.\nUnless we are 100% certain of the premises, the arguments above which\nare invalid on Adams\u2019s criterion guarantee nothing about what\nyou are entitled to think about the conclusion. The line between 100%\ncertainty and something very close is hard to make out: it\u2019s not\nclear how you tell which side of it you are on. The epistemically\ncautious might admit that they are never, or only very rarely, 100%\ncertain of contingent conditionals. So it would be useful to have\nanother category of argument, the \u201csuper-valid\u201d, which\npreserves high probability as well as certainty. Adams has shown us\nwhich arguments (on Supp\u2019s reading of \u201cif\u201d) are\nsuper-valid.\n\nContinuing to restrict our attention to the case where the antecedent\nhas non-zero probability, this argument-form preserves certainty:\nA\\(\\supset\\)B; so A\\(\\Rightarrow\\)B. The\nconverse inference is uncontroversial. So if we were just concerned\nwith certainty preservation, Hook and Supp would be equivalent. But\nthey are far from equivalent for uncertain beliefs: the former can be\narbitrarily close to 1 while the latter is 0.\n",
