    "main_text": "Real-World Affirmative Action: The Workplace\n4. Real-World Affirmative Action: The Workplace\n\n\nThe terms of the popular debate over racial and gender preferences\noften mirrored the arguments philosophers and other academics were\nmaking to each other. Preference\u2019s defenders offered many reasons to\njustify them, reasons having to do with compensatory or distributive\njustice, as well as reasons having to do with social utility (more\nAfrican-Americans in the police department would enable it better to\nserve the community, more female professors in the classroom would\ninspire young women to greater achievements). Critics of preferences\nretorted by pointing to the law. And well they should, since the text\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 seemed a solid anchor even if general\nprinciple proved elusive. Title VI of the Act promised that\n\u201c[n]o person\u2026shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial\n assistance.\u201d[7]\n Title VII similarly prohibited\nall employment practices that discriminated on the basis of race,\ngender, religion, or national\n origin.[8]\n\n\n\nIn face of the plain language of Titles VI and VII, how did\npreferential hiring and promotion ever arise in the first place? How\ncould they be justified legally? Part of the answer lies in the meaning\nof \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d The Civil Rights Act did not define\nthe term. The federal courts had to do that job themselves, and the\ncases before them drove the definition in a particular direction. Many\nfactories and businesses prior to 1964, especially in the South, had\nin place overtly discriminatory policies and rules. For example, a\ncompany\u2019s policy might have openly relegated African-Americans to the\nmaintenance department and channeled whites into operations, sales,\nand management departments, where the pay and opportunities for\nadvancement were far better. If, after passage of the Civil Rights\nAct, the company willingly abandoned its openly segregative policy,\nit could still carry forward the effects of its past segregation\nthrough other already-existing facially neutral rules. For example, a\ncompany policy that required workers to give up their seniority\nin one department if they transferred to another would have locked in\nplace older African-American maintenance workers as effectively as the\ncompany\u2019s own prior segregative rule that made them ineligible to transfer\nat all. Consequently, courts began striking down facially neutral\nrules that carried through the effects of an employer\u2019s past\ndiscrimination, regardless of the original intent or provenance of the\nrules. \u201cIntent\u201d was effectively decoupled from\n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d In 1971, the Supreme Court ratified this\nprocess, giving the following\nconstruction of Title VII:\n\n\nThe objective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII\u2026was\nto achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers\nthat have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white\nemployees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures,\nor tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent,\ncannot be maintained if they operate to \u201cfreeze\u201d the status\nquo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\n\n\nWhat is required by Congress is the removal of artificial,\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers\noperate invidiously to exclude on the basis of racial or other\nimpermissible\n classification.[9]\n\n\n\n\nIn a few short paragraphs the Court advanced from proscribing\npractices that froze in place the effects of a firm\u2019s own past\ndiscrimination to proscribing practices that carried through the\neffects of past discrimination generally. The Court characterized\nstatutory discrimination as any exclusionary practice not necessary\nto an institution\u2019s activities. Since many practices in most\ninstitutions were likely to be exclusionary, rejecting minorities and\nwomen in greater proportion than white men, all institutions needed to\nreassess the full range of their practices to look for, and correct,\ndiscriminatory effect. Against this backdrop, the generic idea of\naffirmative action took form:\n\n\nEach institution should effectively monitor its practices for\nexclusionary effect and revise those that cannot be defended as\n\u201cnecessary\u201d to doing business. In order to make its\nmonitoring and revising effective, an institution ought to predict, as\nbest it can, how many minorities and women it would select over time,\nwere it successfully nondiscriminating. These predictions constitute\nthe institution\u2019s affirmative action \u201cgoals,\u201d and failure\nto meet the goals signals to the institution (and to the government)\nthat it needs to revisit its efforts at eliminating exclusionary \npractices. There may still remain practices that ought to be modified or\n eliminated.[10]\n\n\n\nThe point of such affirmative action: to induce change in institutions\nso that they could comply with the nondiscrimination mandate of the\nCivil Rights Act.\n\n\nHowever, suppose this self-monitoring and revising fell short? In\nearly litigation under the Civil Rights Act, courts concluded that some\ninstitutions, because of their histories of exclusion and\ntheir continuing failure to find qualified women or minorities, needed\nstronger medicine. Courts ordered these institutions to adopt\n\u201cquotas,\u201d to take in specific numbers of formerly excluded\ngroups on the assumption that once these new workers were securely\nlodged in place, the institutions would adapt to this new\n reality.[11]\n\n\nThroughout the 1970s, courts and government enforcement agencies\nextended this idea across the board, requiring a wide range of firms\nand organizations\u2014from AT&T to the Alabama Highway\nPatrol\u2014temporarily to select by the numbers. In all these cases,\nthe use of preferences was tied to a single purpose: to prevent\nongoing and future discrimination. Courts carved out this\njustification for preferences not through caprice but through\nnecessity. They found themselves confronted with a practical dilemma\nthat Congress had never envisaged and thus never addressed when it\nwrote the Civil Rights Act.  The dilemma was this: courts could impose\nracial preferences to change foot-dragging or inept defendants (and by\ndoing so apparently transgress the plain prohibition in Title VII) or\nthey could order less onerous steps they knew would be ineffective,\nthus letting discrimination continue (and by doing so violate their\nduty under Title VII). Reasonably enough, the federal courts resolved\nthis dilemma by appeal to the broad purposes of the Civil Rights Act\nand justified racial preferences where needed to prevent ongoing and\nfuture\n discrimination.[12]\n\n\nThus, preferential affirmative action in the workplace served the\nsame rationale as the non-preferential sort. Its purpose was\nnot to compensate for past wrongs, offset unfair advantage,\nappropriately reward the deserving, or yield a variety\nof social goods; its purpose was to change institutions so they could\ncomply with the nondiscrimination mandate of the Civil Rights Act.\n",
