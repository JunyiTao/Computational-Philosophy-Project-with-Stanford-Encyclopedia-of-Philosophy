    "main_text": "Theodicies || Religious Theodicies\n8. More Modest Variants on Defenses and Theodicies\n In section 1.3, it was argued that concrete formulations of the\nargument from evil, which focus upon specific evils, or else upon\nnarrowly defined types of evils, are superior to abstract formulations\nof the argument from evil, which start out from very general\nstatements concerning evil\u2014such as that there is evil in the\nworld, or that there are natural evils, or that there is an enormous\namount of evil, and so on.  Consider, then, an evidential argument\nfrom evil that focuses upon Rowe\u2019s famous case of Sue\u2014a young\ngirl who was brutally beaten, raped, and murdered.  Confronted with\nsuch a case, it is natural to think that a satisfactory response will\ninvolve arguing that it is plausible that the terrible occurrence in\nquestion itself has some hidden property that makes it the case that\nallowing it to happen is not morally wrong all things considered.\n But as Peter van Inwagen has argued\u2014most recently in The\nProblem of Evil\u2014there is a very different possibility, and one\nthat he thinks is much more promising.  The basic idea is as follows.\nFirst of all, one begins by focusing upon abstract formulations of the\nargument from evil, and one attempts to put forward a story that makes\nit plausible that the existence of, say, a great amount of horrendous\nsuffering in the world, is actually desirable because there is some\ngreat good that outweighs that suffering, and that can only be\nachieved if that amount of suffering is present, or some greater evil\nthat can only be avoided if that amount of suffering is present. (This\nstory might either be a theodicy-style story that specifies the great\ngood in question, or a defense-style story, which does not do so.)\nSecondly, if that story provides a satisfactory answer to an abstract\nversion of the argument from evil that focuses upon the existence of\nhorrendous suffering, one can then turn to concrete versions of the\nargument from evil, and there the idea will be that God had good\nreason to allow a certain amount of horrendous suffering, and the\nterrible case of Sue is simply one of the cases that he allowed.  It\nis not that Sue\u2019s suffering itself had some property that made its\noccurrence good all things considered.  God could very well have prevented it, and had he done so, he would have eliminated an\noccurrence that was bad in itself, all things considered.  But had he\ndone so, he would have had to have allowed some other horrendous evil\nthat, as things stand, he prevented, and the reason that he would have\nhad to do that would be to ensure that the global property of there\nbeing a certain amount of horrendous evil in the world was\ninstantiated\u2014something that was necessary to achieve a greater\ngood, or to avoid a greater evil.\n In short, defenses and theodicies that are based upon this idea,\nrather than appealing to the idea that apparent evils are not evils in\nthemselves, all things considered, once all local properties\u2014all\nproperties that those events themselves have\u2014are taken into\naccount, appeal, instead, to the idea that there are global properties\nwhose instantiation is important, and that can only be instantiated if\nthere are events that are evil in themselves.\nDoes this shift from local properties to global properties help? It\nwould seem that it cannot.  Consider against the case of Sue. An\nadvocate of the evidential argument from evil claims that no matter\nhow carefully one examines the case, and thinks about it, considering,\nas one does, all of the rightmaking and wrongmaking properties of\nwhich one has any knowledge, the conclusion is that the wrongmaking\nproperties of allowing what happened to Sue clearly outweigh any\nrightmaking properties of allowing that event.  The advocate of a\nglobal property approach then suggests the possibility that there is\nsome global rightmaking property that involves the world\u2019s having a\ncertain amount of evil, or a certain amount of a certain kind of evil,\nand that if someone had intervened to prevent the rape and murder of\nSue, this would have changed the world from one that did have the\ndesired amount of evil, or evil of the type in question, to one that\ndoes not, and that when this property is taken into account, it turns\nout that it would have been wrong to prevent Sue\u2019s being raped and\nmurdered\u2014unless one was going to allow some compensating evil\nelsewhere.\nBut what exactly is the global wrongmaking property in question?\nDoes one know, or even have any reason at all for believing, that\nbringing it about that the amount of evil of kind \\(K\\) is less than some\nspecific amount \\(T\\) is a wrongmaking property of actions?  The answer,\nsurely, is that no one has knowledge of any such wrongmaking\nproperty. Moreover, anyone who claimed to have such knowledge would\nalso have to claim also to know that if an omnipotent and omniscient\nbeing had prevented the rape and murder of Sue, without also allowing\nsome other, compensating evil action, that would have caused the\namount of evil of type \\(K\\) to dip below level \\(T\\).\nOne need not, of course, advance a principle involving some\nspecific value of \\(T\\). One could, instead, make the existential claim\nthat there is some level \\(T\\) such that, first, it is a wrongmaking\nproperty of an action to cause the amount of evil of type \\(K\\) to dip\nbelow level \\(T\\), and, second, that if an omnipotent and omniscient being\nhad intervened to prevent the rape and murder of Sue, that would, in\nthe absence of some compensating action, have caused the amount of\nevil of type \\(K\\) to dip below level \\(T\\). But surely no one knows, or even\nhas any reason for believing, that this is the case.\nThe situation as regards an appeal to global properties is, in\nshort, as follows.  An advocate of the argument from evil points to\nvarious events, such as the rape and murder of Sue, and claims that no\nmatter how carefully one considers the case, one\u2019s conclusion is that\nthe known wrongmaking properties of not preventing that occurrence\noutweigh any rightmaking properties that not preventing the occurrence\nis known to have had.  In response, the possibility of a relevant,\nmorally significant global property is introduced.  But this is a mere\npossibility, since there is no relevant morally significant global\nproperty of which one has knowledge, let alone which one has good\nreason to believe is present in the case in question.  So the\npossibility of a relevant global property is simply that: a mere\npossibility, and as such it gets dealt with in the way that all\nunknown morally significant properties, both rightmaking and\nwrongmaking, and both local and global, are dealt with in, for example,\nthe logical probability version of the evidential argument from evil\nset out above in section 3.5.\n",
