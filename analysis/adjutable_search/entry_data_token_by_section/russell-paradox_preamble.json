    "main_text": "\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox is the most famous of the logical or\nset-theoretical paradoxes. Also known as the Russell-Zermelo paradox,\nthe paradox arises within na\u00efve set theory by considering the set\nof all sets that are not members of themselves. Such a set appears to\nbe a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself.\nHence the paradox. \n\nSome sets, such as the set of all teacups, are not members of\nthemselves. Other sets, such as the set of all non-teacups, are\nmembers of themselves. Call the set of all sets that are not members\nof themselves \u201c\\(R\\).\u201d If \\(R\\) is a member of\nitself, then by definition it must not be a member of itself.\nSimilarly, if \\(R\\) is not a member of itself, then by definition\nit must be a member of itself. \n\nAlthough also noticed by Ernst Zermelo, the contradiction was not\nthought to be important until it was discovered independently by\n Bertrand Russell\n in the spring of 1901. Since then, the paradox has prompted a great\ndeal of work in logic,\n set theory\n and the\n philosophy and foundations of mathematics.\n",
