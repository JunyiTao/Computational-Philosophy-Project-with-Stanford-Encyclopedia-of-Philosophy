    "main_text": "Optics and metaphysics of light\n6. Optics and metaphysics of light\n\nKepler contributed to the special field of optics with two seminal\nworks, the Ad Vitellionem paralipomena (=APO) and\nthe Dioptrice (=DI), the latter motivated in large part by\nthe publication in 1610 of Galileo\u2019s Sidereal Messenger\n(Sidereus Nuncius). In his Conversation with the Sidereal\nMessenger (Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo \u2026 a\nGalillaeo Galilaeo, KGW 4, pp. 281\u2013311), he supported the\nfactual information given by Galileo, indicating at the same time the\nnecessity of giving an account of the causes of the observed\nphenomena. The background for his investigation into optics was\nundoubtedly the different particular questions of astronomical optics\n(see Straker 1971). In this context he concentrated his efforts on an\nexplanation of the phenomena of eclipses, of the apparent size of the\nMoon and of atmospheric refraction. Kepler investigated the theory of\nthe camera obscura very early and recorded its general\nprinciples (see commentary by M. Hammer in KGW 2, pp. 400\u20131 and\nStraker 1981). In addition, he worked intensively on the theory of the\ntelescope and invented the refracting astronomical or\n\u2018Keplerian\u2019 telescope, which involved a considerable\nimprovement over the Galilean telescope (see especially DI, Problem\n86, KGW 4, pp. 387\u201388). Besides these impressive contributions,\nKepler expanded his research program to embrace mathematics as well as\nanatomy, discussing for instance conic sections and explaining the\nprocess of vision (see Crombie 1991 and especially Lindberg\n1976b).\n\nIn Chapter 1 of APO (\u201cOn the Nature of Light\u201d), Kepler\nexpounds 38 propositions concerning different properties of light:\nlight flows in all directions from every point of a body\u2019s\nsurface; it has no matter, weight, or resistance. Following\u2014but\nalso inverting\u2014the Aristotelian argument for the temporality of\nmotion, he affirms that the motion of light takes place not in time\nbut in an instant (in momento). Light is propagated by\nstraight lines (rays), which are not light itself but its motion. It\nis important to note that although light travels from one body to\nanother, it is not a body but a two-dimensional entity which tends to\nexpand to a curved surface. The two-dimensionality of light is\nprobably the main reason why it is incorporeal. Motion in general\nplays a significant role in Kepler\u2019s philosophy of light. For\nStraker, the supposed link between optics and physics (especially in\nProp. 20, where the mechanical analyses are introduced) \u201creveals\nthe full extent of his commitment to a mechanical physics of\nlight\u201d (Straker 1971, p. 509).\n\nTwo questions are intensively discussed by modern specialists.\nFirstly, to what extent is the attribution of a mechanistic approach\nto Kepler justified? Secondly, how should one determine his place in\nthe history of sciences, especially in the field of optics: do the\nmain lines of thought in Kepler\u2019s optics indicate a\ncontinuity or rather a rupture with tradition? There\nare well\u2013grounded arguments for different positions on both\nquestions. For Crombie (1967, 1991) and Straker, Kepler develops a\nmechanical approach, which can be particularly appreciated in his\nexplanation of vision using the model of the camera obscura.\nBesides this, Straker stresses that Kepler\u2019s basic mechanicism\nis also powerfully assisted by his conception of light as a\nnon-active, passive entity. In addition, the concept of motion and the\nexplanations using the model of the balance are indicative of a\ncommitment to mechanicism (Straker 1970, pp. 502\u20133). On the\ncontrary, Lindberg (1976a), who supports the \u201ccontinuity\nside\u201d of the dispute, has quite convincingly showed that, for\nKepler, light has a constructive and active function in the universe,\nnot only in optics but also in astrology, astronomy, and natural\nphilosophy (for Kepler\u2019s criticism of the medieval tradition see\nalso Chen-Morris / Unguru, 2001).\n",
