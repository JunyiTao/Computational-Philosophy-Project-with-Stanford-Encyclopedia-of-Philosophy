    "main_text": "The Debate over the Conventionality of Language || Against Treating Languages as Conventions\n2.3 Against Treating Languages as Conventions\n\nIn \u201cA Nice Derangement of Epitaphs\u201d, Donald Davidson\nargues that languages, if they are \u201canything like what many\nphilosophers and linguists have supposed\u201d, do not exist (1986:\n446). He does not list the philosophers and linguists he has in mind,\nbut somewhere near the centre of the cloud of positions he is\ncriticizing is Lewis\u2019s conventionalist\n theory.[1]\n More broadly, he rejects the notion of socially established links\nbetween expressions and meanings, shared participation in which\nenables a community to communicate. Davidson\u2019s article is\njargon-rich and so his argument is tricky to unpack. In this statement\nof it, we begin by explaining his formulation of the view he rejects,\nthen outline his case against the view so\n formulated.[2]\n\nThe view is expressed as the claim that first meaning is shared,\nsystematic, and prepared. To see what he means by \u201cfirst\nmeaning\u201d, consider Grice\u2019s famous example of a testimonial\nfor an academic job candidate:\n\n\nDear Sir, Mr X\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his\nattendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc. (Grice 1975:\n33)\n\n\nThe author\u2019s insinuation\u2014that Mr X is a weak\ncandidate\u2014is arrived at only via a prior interpretation of the\nexpressions as they are used in the utterance. This prior\ninterpretation is the first meaning. The contrast implicit in\n\u201cfirst\u201d is with the insinuations or implicatures one\nsubsequently goes on to read into the utterance. Davidson uses\n\u201cfirst\u201d meaning in an effort to avoid the terms\n\u201cliteral\u201d or \u201cconventional\u201d meaning because\nthe thought that there is a level of meaning that is somehow\ndetermined independently of the communicative act, by linguistic\nconvention, is exactly what he plans to challenge. \u201cFirst\nmeaning\u201d is to be understood more neutrally as the initial\nmeaning the utterer intends you to ascribe to the uttered expressions\nin the context of a particular utterance.\n\nOn the view Davidson rejects, successful communication happens because\nthis first meaning is shared (i.e., utterer and audience\nassign the same first meaning), prepared (i.e., it was\navailable to both utterer and audience prior to the utterance) and\nsystematic (i.e., capturable in a compositional theory). All\nthree properties are implicit in the conventionalist supposition that\nexpressions have their meaning specified within the social language\nfrom which they are drawn. We might conceptualize this social language\nas English, or instead as a convention in Lewis\u2019s technical\nsense. If the latter, the claim Davidson has in his sights is that\ncommunication within a given linguistic community is made possible by\na (shared, prepared, systematic) convention to be truthful and\ntrusting in some L. Davidson denies that there is any such\nL.\n\nHis argument against first meaning\u2019s being systematic, shared,\nand prepared emerges from reflection on various linguistic phenomena,\nall of which have in common that \u201cthe speaker expects to be, and\nis, interpreted as the speaker intended, although the interpreter did\nnot have a correct theory in advance\u201d (1986: 440). Grice\u2019s\nexample does not fit this description. It does not,\ntherefore, threaten the thought that the first meaning (about regular\nattendance) is the simple product of an antecedently shared\ncompositional theory. Malapropisms, on the other hand do fit the\ndescription. Here is the original Mrs Malaprop addressing Captain\nAbsolute in the exchange that gives Davidson\u2019s paper its\ntitle:\n\n\n[I]f I reprehend anything in this world, it is the use of my oracular\ntongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs! (Richard Sheridan, The\nRivals, Act III, Scene 3)\n\n\nCaptain Absolute manages to figure out the first meaning of Mrs\nMalaprop\u2019s utterance, which is that if she understands\n(comprehends) anything it is the use of her own vernacular tongue and\na nice arrangement of epithets. Davidson offers an intuitive\ndescription of what is going on in this case, a description that\napplies equally to regular communicative exchange. He then argues that\nthis description of communicative exchange is incompatible with the\nclaim that first meaning is systematic, shared, and prepared\u2014and\nso conventional.\n\nThe intuitive description is couched in terms of prior theories and\npassing theories of first meaning, defined for an arbitrary utterer\nS and intended audience H as follows:\n\n\nH\u2019s prior theory: How H is prepared in\nadvance of S\u2019s utterance to interpret the expressions in\nit\n\nS\u2019s prior theory: What S believes\nH\u2019s prior theory to be\n\nS\u2019s passing theory: The theory S intends\nH to use to interpret the expressions in S\u2019s\nutterance\n\nH\u2019s passing theory: How H in fact\ninterprets the expressions in S\u2019s utterance\n\n\nSuccessful communication at the level of first meaning happens\nwhenever S\u2019s and H\u2019s passing theories\ncoincide, notwithstanding any disagreement in prior theories. Letting\nS be Mrs. Malaprop and H be Captain Absolute, their\nprior and passing theories assign meanings to \u201cepitaph\u201d as\nin the table below:\n\n\n\n\nS\nH \n\nMeaning of \u201cepitaph\u201d in prior theory\nepithet \nepitaph  \n\nMeaning of \u201cepitaph\u201d in passing theory\nepithet \nepithet  \n\n\n\nNeither meaning-according-to-prior-theories nor\nmeaning-according-to-passing-theories have all three of the properties\nrequired to make them conventional. Specifically:\n\nPrior theories are systematic and prepared, but not shared.\nPassing theories are systematic and shared, but not prepared\n\n\nDavidson anticipates the simple response that two interlocutors\n\u201cshare the same language\u201d if their prior theories overlap\nclosely enough that they can exploit ad hoc strategies for\ninterpretation, such as that used by Captain Absolute and the theatre\naudience, i.e., searching for a similar sounding word that makes sense\nof the utterance in context. But these \u201cprinciples of \u2026\ninventive accommodation are not themselves reducible to theory,\ninvolving as they do nothing less than all our skills at theory\nconstruction\u201d. In other words:\n\n\nSuch a capacity, though shared and prepared, is not systematic.\n\n\nTo put the claim as a charge against Lewis in particular: there is no\nL, no pairing of sentences and meanings, such that\ncommunication as it actually occurs is made possible by virtue of a\n(shared, prepared, systematic) convention to be truthful and trusting\nin L.\n\nMalapropisms may seem like a marginal phenomenon to be treated as a\nspecial case. But Davidson thinks the point generalizes, and that\nachieving passing-theory agreement involves far more work than\nparticipating in a convention. For a start there are plenty of\nrelevantly similar phenomena (metaphor, polysemy, incomplete\nsentences, unfamiliar names, and performance errors such as slips of\nthe tongue or temporary confusion over whether to use\n\u201cunderestimated\u201d or \u201coverestimated\u201d after\n\u201ccannot be\u201d). Indeed, even where there is\nprior-theory agreement, general intelligence and not simply\napplication of a known convention must be exercised by both speaker\nand audience to appreciate this fact.\n",
