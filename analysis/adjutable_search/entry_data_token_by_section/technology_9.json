    "main_text": "Ethical and Social Aspects of Technology || The Development of the Ethics of Technology\n3.1 The Development of the Ethics of Technology\n\nIt was not until the twentieth century that the development of the\nethics of technology as a systematic and more or less independent\nsubdiscipline of philosophy started. This late development may seem\nsurprising given the large impact that technology has had on society,\nespecially since the industrial revolution.\n\nA plausible reason for this late development of ethics of technology\nis the instrumental perspective on technology that was mentioned in\n Section 2.2.\n This perspective implies, basically, a positive ethical assessment of\ntechnology: technology increases the possibilities and capabilities of\nhumans, which seems in general desirable. Of course, since antiquity,\nit has been recognized that the new capabilities may be put to bad use\nor lead to human hubris. Often, however, these undesirable\nconsequences are attributed to the users of technology, rather than\nthe technology itself, or its developers. This vision is known as the\ninstrumental vision of technology resulting in the so-called\nneutrality thesis. The neutrality thesis holds that technology is a\nneutral instrument that can be put to good or bad use by its users.\nDuring the twentieth century, this neutrality thesis met with severe\ncritique, most prominently by Heidegger and Ellul, who have been\nmentioned in this context in\n Section 2,\n but also by philosophers from the Frankfurt School, such as\nHorkheimer and Adorno (1947 [2002]), Marcuse (1964), and Habermas\n(1968 [1970]).\n\nThe scope and the agenda for ethics of technology to a large extent\ndepend on how technology is conceptualized. The second half of the\ntwentieth century has witnessed a richer variety of conceptualizations\nof technology that move beyond the conceptualization of technology as\na neutral tool, as a world view or as a historical necessity. This\nincludes conceptualizations of technology as a political phenomenon\n(Winner, Feenberg, Sclove), as a social activity (Latour, Callon,\nBijker and others in the area of science and technology studies), as a\ncultural phenomenon (Ihde, Borgmann), as a professional activity\n(engineering ethics, e.g., Davis), and as a cognitive activity (Bunge,\nVincenti). Despite this diversity, the development in the second half\nof the twentieth century is characterized by two general trends. One\nis a move away from technological determinism and the assumption that\ntechnology is a given self-contained phenomenon which develops\nautonomously to an emphasis on technological development being the\nresult of choices (although not necessarily the intended result). The\nother is a move away from ethical reflection on technology as such to\nethical reflection of specific technologies and to specific phases in\nthe development of technology. Both trends together have resulted in\nan enormous increase in the number and scope of ethical questions that\nare asked about technology. The developments also imply that ethics of\ntechnology is to be adequately empirically informed, not only about\nthe exact consequences of specific technologies but also about the\nactions of engineers and the process of technological development.\nThis has also opened the way to the involvement of other disciplines\nin ethical reflections on technology, such as Science and Technology\nStudies (STS) and Technology Assessment (TA).\n",
