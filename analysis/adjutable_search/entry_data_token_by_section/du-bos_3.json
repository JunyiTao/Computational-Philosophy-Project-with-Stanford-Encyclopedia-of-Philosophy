Du Bos on epistemology and philosophy of science\n\nDu Bos\u2019s primary contributions to philosophy are in aesthetics\nbut he also contributed to the revolt against Cartesianism in France.\nCartesianism dominated French thinking about knowledge and science\nuntil well into the eighteenth century (Illiffe 2003, 269). Du\nBos\u2019s approach to philosophy of art was thoroughly empiricist\nand so was his attitude towards science. He deserves credit for\napplying Locke\u2019s empirical account of knowledge to scientific\nhypotheses.\n\nIn the first instance, Du Bos applied empiricism to the study of art,\nas we have seen. According to Du Bos, judgements of works of art must\nbe empirical. He writes that\n\nDo we use reason to determine whether a ragout is good or bad? Did you\never, after having applied geometrical principles to the flavour,\ndetermine the properties that each of the ingredients contributes, go\non to discuss the proportions preserved in their mixture, in order to\ndecide whether the ragout is good? You never have. We have a sense\nthat makes us recognize whether the cook has followed the rules of his\nart. We taste the ragout and, even without knowing these rules, we\nknow that it is good. It is the same with works of wit and pictures\nmade to please us by touching us (519).\n\n\nElsewhere Du Bos adds that\n\nif there is some matter where reason should fall silent in the face of\nexperience, it is certainly in questions that can be raised regarding\nthe value of a poem. It is when we want to know whether a poem is\npleasing or not; if, generally speaking, a poem is an excellent work\nor just average\u2026there are few general principles to rely on\nregarding the value of a poem (531).\n\n\nDu Bos stresses the importance of sentiments, that is, the feelings we\nhave in response to works of art.\n\nWhile Du Bos rejected rationalism in judgements about art, his\nempiricism did not end there. He was opposed to the a priori\nconstruction of scientific systems. He notes that\n\nThe two most famous philosophical organizations in Europe, the Academy\nof Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London, refuse to adopt\nor build a single general system of natural science. Agreeing with the\nview of Chancellor Bacon, they have espoused not a single one out of\nfear that having to justify it should draw attention from onlookers\nand make them see experiments not as they truly are, but as they\nshould be, in order to give weight to an opinion they try to pass off\nas true. Our two famous academies rest content to verify facts and\npublish them in their journals, persuaded that nothing is easier\naccording to reason and that they would stumble if they took two steps\nbeyond what they acquired from experience. These two organizations\nexpect a general system on the basis of first-hand\nexperience (527).\n\n\nIn another passage, Du Bos discusses Harvey\u2019s discovery of the\ncirculation of blood and makes clear that it could only have been\ndiscovered a posteriori. People have accepted Harvey\u2019s\nhypothesis, Du Bos writes, because\n\nthey know that it no longer relies on reasoning for its proof and that\nit is demonstrated by experience. To repeat, people have much more\nconfidence in those who tell them \u201cI have seen\u201d than in\nthose who tell them \u201cI have concluded\u201d (589).\n\n\nThis passage is clearly an endorsement of empiricism and a rejection\nof Cartesian rationalism.\n\nDu Bos makes a related claim in a discussion of physicians. A\nphysician may be a Cartesian while young, but he will end up as an\nempiricist. According to Du Bos,\n\nAt twenty-five, a doctor is as persuaded of the truth of his\nanatomical reasoning, which tries to discover the manner by which\ncinchona bark works to alleviate intermittent fevers, as he is by the\neffectiveness of the remedy. By age sixty, a doctor is persuaded by\nthe truth of a fact that he has seen multiple times, but he does not\nput any faith in the explanation of the effect of the remedy than\nby the piling up of examples, if it permitted to use that\nexpression. (530)\n\n\nExperience will transform the wise physician into an empiricist.\nElsewhere, Du Bos says something similar about engineering, navigation\nand related sciences. He considers four modern scientific discoveries\n(the discovery of air pressure, the invention of the compass, the\ndevelopment of the printing press, and the invention of the telescope)\nand observes that all of these discoveries were due to the acquisition\nof new experiences.\n\nWhen Du Bos investigates any scientific matter, he proceeds in an\nempirical fashion. For example, he examines the question of why\ncertain eras have produced more geniuses than other periods. He begins\nby considering the hypothesis that a social cause is responsible for\nthe production of geniuses. In particular, he considers the hypothesis\nthat the production of geniuses can be explained by reference to\ngenerous patrons. He refutes this hypothesis by giving examples of\neras when patrons abounded but geniuses were scarce. Having\nempirically refuted this hypothesis, he considers the hypothesis that\ngenius has a natural or physical cause. Du Bos supports this\nhypothesis by attempting to find a correlation between certain\nenvironmental, climatic, and dietary factors and the production of\ngenius. Du Bos\u2019s views on the origin of genius were widely\naccepted in the first two thirds of the eighteenth century. Herder,\nMontesquieu, Voltaire, and Winckelmann were among the important\nfigures to adopt Du Bos\u2019s views on climate and genius.\n\nDu Bos held that scientific investigation always involves some\nuncertainty. He wrote that \u201cI distrust physical explanations,\nsince the imperfection of this science almost always makes guesswork\nnecessary\u201d (362). According to Du Bos, a scientific hypothesis\nis only probable to some extent or another. He illustrates this view\nby reference to Harvey\u2019s hypothesis concerning the circulation\nof blood. Du Bos writes that, \u201cMost scholars of his\n[Harvey\u2019s] time were persuaded by his views. It was as firmly\nand widely established as a scientific truth as something that is not\ndirectly observed can be. That is, it was regarded as a view more\nprobable than the contrary opinion\u201d (588).\n",
