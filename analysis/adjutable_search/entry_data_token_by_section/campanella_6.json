    "main_text": "Natural Religion: Atheism Conquered\n7. The Years of Imprisonment in Naples and the Sojourns in Rome and Paris\n\nDuring the twenty-seven years he spent imprisoned in Neapolitan\ncastles (1599\u20131626), Campanella dedicated himself to the huge task of\nproviding a new foundation for the entire encyclopedia of knowledge,\nwriting, in addition to the works already mentioned, texts dealing\nwith medicine, astrology, practical religion (in Quod\nreminiscentur he addressed eloquent appeals to members of all the\nreligions of the world, aimed at persuading them to abandon irrational\nbeliefs and to come together in Christian rationality), the\nMetaphysica, later printed in Paris, and a theological\ntreatise in thirty books, whose publication, begun in the middle of\nthe nineteenth century, is still in progress. One of the most\ninteresting of his works is the Apologia per Galileo\n(Defense of Galileo). Written in 1616, when difficulties\nrelating to natural theology first began to amass around Copernican\nand Galilean doctrines, and printed in Frankfurt in 1622, the\nApologia represents an act of great courage and intellectual\nhonesty on Campanella\u2019s part, since he took up this delicate issue\nwhile he was still in prison and, furthermore, was not even defending\nhis own doctrines. His own image of the book of nature, conceived as a\nliving and organic entity, was far from Galileo\u2019s picture of a book\nwritten in mathematical characters. Rather than a defense of\nheliocentrism, about which Campanella harbored grave reservations on\naccount of its incompatibility with Telesian physics, the\nApologia is a defense of the intellectual and academic\nfreedom (libertas philosophandi) of Galileo and, more\ngenerally, of all Christian natural philosophers, whose first right\nand duty is to give preference to reading the book of nature over\nstudying the books written by human beings. With great clarity,\nCampanella identifies the nub of the problem as the unjustified\ndogmatic value conferred on Aristotelian philosophy which, like all\nhuman doctrines, does not possess absolute and definitive certainty.\nAll philosophies, in fact, must be modified, corrected or abandoned in\nlight of our reading of the book of nature. In this brief work he\ndraws on his immense theological knowledge to rethink in a profound\nand lucid manner the relationship between philosophy, science and\ntheology. In a virtuoso demonstration of his hermeneutic\nabilities\u2014on account of which the treatise in many places\ndifficult going for the reader, who is in danger of getting lost in\nthe thick tangle of citations\u2014Campanella attempts to show how\nthe longstanding union of theology and Aristotelian philosophy,\nregarded by theologians as necessary and unalterable, is in reality\nprecarious, dated and in need of revision. Such a revision would pose\nno risk to theology; on the contrary, theology will be harmed by an\nobstinate and blind adherence to a system of physics that is no longer\nin agreement with new data and that rejects new discoveries.\nAbandoning Aristotelian philosophy not only would not bring about the\ncollapse of theology, it would permit the recovery of a correct\nconception of science, one that must consist, as it did for Galileo,\nin a continual reading of the infinite book of nature, which is the\nexpression of the infinite truth and of Christian rationality. On this\nbasis Campanella invited Christianity to accept the rational and\nnatural values of science with confidence and without unjustified\nfears, if it intended to set itself up as the authentic expression of\nChrist as the Word of God.\n\nFreed from prison in Naples in 1626, Campanella moved to Rome, where\nhe lived until 1634. The most notorious episode of his Roman sojourn\nwas connected to Pope Urban VIII\u2019s desire to take advantage of his\nastrological expertise in order to counter the ever more insistent\npredictions of his imminent death, based on the inauspicious\ndisposition of the stars. Called to the papal palace, Campanella put\ninto effect the natural magic practices described in his short\ntreatise De siderali fato vitando (How To Avoid the Fate\nDictated by the Stars). Reprising themes borrowed from Marsilio\nFicino, who had taught how to attract the favor of the stars,\nCampanella proposed to teach how to avoid the evils threatened by the\nstars through taking suitable precautions. The most famous and\ncontroversial pages of this work, since they deal with practices used\non the pope, are those in which Campanella suggests remedies against\nthe possible harm caused by eclipses and comets. When an eclipse\nappears to threaten a specific person, he counsels using every\nprecaution to prevent the seeds carried in the polluted air from\nfinding a favorable terrain and producing their noxious effects. He\nthen explains how to demarcate a separate space that will be\nimpenetrable to malign influences. With the doors and windows sealed,\nthe air should be purified by sprinkling perfumes and scents and by\nburning aromatic woods such as laurel, myrtle, rosemary and cypress.\nIn the room, decorated with foliage and fabric of white silk, one\nshould set alight two lamps, five torches and other lights in order to\nrepresent the planets of the zodiac. It will also be useful to seek\nout the company of friends who are not subject to the negative effects\nof the eclipse, to play music connected with Jupiter and Venus, and to\nhave recourse to all those \u201centicements,\u201d connected with\nplants, stones, colors and odors, capable of attracting beneficent\ninfluences and countering malign ones. If the darkness of the eclipse\nseems to suspend and interrupt the life that flows from the heavens,\nit will be necessary to secure protection by constructing a sort of\nartificial sky. De fato was published in Lyons in 1629 as the\nseventh and final book of Campanella\u2019s Astrologia. This\nrisked compromising the pope himself by involving him in accusations\nof superstitious practices. Campanella was quick to write an\nApologeticus in which he attempted to demonstrate that the\npractices recommended in De fato were not superstitious but\nrather entirely natural. In a further effort to avert any scandal, in\nthe early months of 1632 Urban VIII hurriedly promulgated an extremely\nsevere bull, Inscrutabilis, directed against astrologers. The\npope also had Don Orazio Morandi, abbot of the monastery of Santa\nPrassede, in which astrological practices were entangled with shady\npolitical intrigues, imprisoned and put to death (see the introduction\nto Campanella, Opuscoli astrologici, pp. 41\u201342).\n\nFollowing new threats from the Spanish, in 1634 Campanella was forced\nto go into exile in Paris. There he devoted his energies to the\npublication of his works, bringing out a new edition of the\nPhilosophia realis in four parts, accompanied by\nquaestiones; reprints of De sensu rerum and of\nAtheismus triumphatus; Philosophia rationalis in\nfive parts (Dialectica, Grammatica, Rhetorica,\nPoetica and Historiographia); and, above all, the\nMetaphysica, which he described with legitimate pride in the\ndedicatory letter as the \u201cphilosophers\u2019 bible.\u201d This is a\nvast and complex work, in which the most important themes of his\nthought come together and in which he sets out the doctrine of the\n\u201cprimalities\u201d (primalitates), the constituent\nprinciples of the Supreme Being and of all other created beings. God,\nthe first infinite cause, has his essence in the principles of Power,\nWisdom and Love in an infinite manner. Every finite being is composed\nof these same primalities but in ways and proportions that are limited\nand differentiated. Nothingness does not exist either in God or\noutside of him; but he makes use of it to construct the finiteness and\nthe distinctiveness of entities. After the explanation of the doctrine\nof the primalities comes that of the three great influences:\nNecessity, Fate and Harmony, the vehicles by which the divine Idea, in\nall its infinite degrees, is conveyed to the world and to matter. In\nthe light of these doctrines, Campanella re-examines fundamental\nissues such as the relationship between necessity and contingency and\nbetween human freedom, fate and providence, as well as problems\nconcerning evil and sin.\n\nDuring his years in Paris Campanella\u2019s interest in politics and in\nprophecy, subjects close to his heart, resurfaced. In the two year\nperiod from 1635 to 1636 there was a remarkable blossoming of\npolitical writings, different in style and persuasive power, but\nsharing in common certain similar themes. Making a comparative\nanalysis of the two great European powers, Spain and France, he shows\nthat Spain is on the downward slope of an inexorable decline, while\nits adversary is in the ascendant phase of \u201cmounting\nsuccess\u201d and, as the new superpower, is exhorted to assume the\nrole of re-unifying the Christian flock and asserting itself as the\nchampion of liberty against the tyranny of Spanish-Habsburg rule.\nThere are two points in particular that most dramatically reveal the\nfatal decline of Spain: it has not known either how to spread\nSpanishness to other nations or to how to manage economy affairs\neffectively. While the ancient Romans were masters of gradually\naccumulating populations and making them participants in the empire,\nthe Spanish, on account of their immense pride, spurn any integration\nwhatever with other peoples. Because of their unwillingness to adopt\nthe shrewd political tactic of mixed marriages that Campanella had\nsuggested in the Monarchia di Spagna, an alarming\ndemographic contraction has occurred due to the loss of soldiers in war\nand the infertility of women, so that the Spanish population, formerly\nnumbering eight million, has now been reduced to half that figure.\nBecause of the scarcity of the populace, they have have\ninduced\u2014and this is a very serious consequence\u2014to destroy\nand depopulate the countries that they conquer in the New World.\nChosen by divine providence to evangelize the entire world, the\nSpanish have betrayed their mission, transforming themselves into\nexecutioners and instruments of divine wrath. An even greater\ncondemnation of Spanish politics is its disastrous economic policy. In\nthe Monarchia di Spagna Campanella had already said that the\ngold of the New World had ruined the Old Word, generating greed for\nriches and therefore weakening the ties and solidarity between\nhumans. In his later works he repeated the view that affluence had\nexacerbated social inequalities, together with the vices that derive\nfrom them.\n\nAt the request of Cardinal Richelieu, Campanella wrote and dedicated\nto him a short treatise on chiromancy, entitled\nChiroroscopia; and on the occasion of the long-awaited birth\nof the Dauphin, the future Sun King, Louis XIV, he composed a lengthy\nLatin Eclogue, in which he returned to the prophetic themes\nthat had always been dear to him. In these verses he once again\npredicted the advent of an epoch of unity and peace: impiety,\ndeception, lying and disputes would be abolished; work, distributed\namong everyone, would be turned from painful labor into a game; lambs\nwould no longer fear wolves; and sovereigns would rule for the benefit\nof their people. Aware of dire presages connected to the coming of a\nsolar eclipse, he sought to avert the impending dangers; but he died\nat dawn on May 21, 1639.\n",
