    "main_text": "Varieties of Kantian Constructivism || Constructivism as Procedural Realism\n2.2 Constructivism as Procedural Realism\n\nThe anti-metaphysical orientation of constructivism is apparent in\nearly defenses of metaethical constructivism. For instance, Christine\nKorsgaard characterizes Kantian constructivism as a form of\n\u201cprocedural realism\u201d \u2013 the view that \u201cthere\nare answers to moral questions because there are correct\nprocedures for arriving at them\u201d; and she contrasts procedural\nrealism with \u201csubstantive realism\u201d \u2013 the view that\n\n\n\nthere are correct procedures for answering moral questions\nbecause there are moral truths or facts, which exist\nindependently of those procedures, and which those procedures track.\n(Korsgaard 1996a: 36\u201337, see also Korsgaard 1983: 183) \n\n\nSubstantive realism holds that there are objective criteria of\ncorrectness for moral judgments only if such judgments represent\nmatters of fact about the way the world is. By contrast, the\nconstructivist view is that there are objective criteria of moral\njudgment insofar as there are objective criteria about how to reason\nabout practical matters. There are objective reasons that prohibit\ndeceiving and manipulating others, but such reasons are the result of\npractical reasoning, rather than discovered by empirical\ninvestigation, grasped by the intellect, or revealed by some god. What\nmakes this view \u201cKantian\u201d is that there is ultimately one\ncriterion for reasoning on practical matters, which is the Categorical\nImperative. By reasoning according to this criterion, we objectively\nground moral obligations, which are requirements of practical reason.\n\n\nKorsgaard\u2019s case for constructivism parallels Kant\u2019s\nargument for the autonomy of practical reason, as Rawls reconstructs\nit. It starts by objecting that substantive realism fails to respond\nto the skeptical challenge that there really are no reasons to be\nmoral. This is because realism simply assumes the existence of\nobjective standards for morality without offering a rational basis for\nthem; hence the realist affirms what the skeptic denies. As a\nconsequence, the realist also fails to show why we really ought to do\nas morality says, and thus fails as an account of the authority of\nmoral obligations (Korsgaard 1996a; Korsgaard 2008: 30\u201331,\n55\u201357, 67\u201368; Stern 2012a; Brady 2002). Realists presume\nthat, in order to fend off skepticism, one has to anchor practical\nreasons in facts that are in themselves normative. But no appeal to\nsuch \u2018normative facts\u2019 can explain how they count as\nreasons and motivate rational agents. Suppose we agree that it is a\nnormative fact that deception is morally wrong. How does awareness of\nthis fact rationally compel us to refrain from deceiving? This is not\nonly a psychological question about the impact that such a fact might\nhave on our minds, but also, and most importantly, a normative\nquestion that concerns its authority.\n\nAccording to Korsgaard, humans are self-reflective agents, capable of\nreflecting on themselves and considering their thoughts and desires\nfrom a detached perspective. Reflection makes room for raising\nquestions about what there is reason to do or to believe (1996a:\n10\u201311, 17, 93). That is, in reflection, rational agents call\ninto question the legitimacy of particular thoughts and desires and\nsuspend their pull. Because they are reflective, rational agents have\nideals about the sort of persons they want to be, and they can guide\ntheir minds and actions accordingly. They are capable of\nself-governance because they are capable of governing themselves by\nendorsing universal standards. The appropriate form of self-governance\nis thus self-legislation (Korsgaard 1996a: 36, 91, 231\u2013232;\nKorsgaard 2008: 3).\n\nRational agents are guided by universal principles that they have\nlegislated. However, this is not to say that particular agents\narbitrarily determine the moral law; otherwise, evil people would not\nbe bound by the moral law (Korsgaard 1996a: 234\u2013235;\nO\u2019Neill 2003c; Reath 2006: 112\u2013113, 92\u2013170;\nKorsgaard 2008: 207\u2013229). On the contrary, the claim is that\nrational agents are guided by universal principles (Korsgaard 1996a:\n36, 234\u2013236; Korsgaard 2008: 207\u2013229; Reath 2006:\n112\u2013113, 92\u2013170). But the moral law obliges us only\ninsofar as it is self-legislated. That is, one can autonomously act on\nthe moral requirements only if one legislates them. Furthermore,\nuniversal principles guarantee that action is expressive of an\nagent\u2019s integrity, rather than driven by unreflective\npreferences or desires. This is because universal principles are the\nconstitutive principles of rational actions, on the Kantian view.\nCorrespondingly, an agent that acts mindlessly or compulsively lacks\nthe sort of integrity that is characteristic of rational agents. That\nsaid, it is possible for rational agents to act in the pursuit of\ndesires, when they have survived due reflection. \n\nA canonical objection to the attempt to ground morality on rationality\nalone is that it fails to account for the special bonds and ties we\nhave with our loved ones and thus fails to capture the nature of\nintegrity and morality (Williams 1981: chapters 1\u20132). To address\nthese worries, Korsgaard introduces the notion of \u201cpractical\nidentities\u201d, which specify roles as sources of special\nobligations (Korsgaard 1996a: 101, \u00a73.3.1; Korsgaard 2009: 20).\nFor instance, Guy values himself and finds his life worth living and\nhis actions worth undertaking under the description of being a teacher\nof music, an American citizen, and Robert\u2019s best friend. These\npractical identities govern Guy\u2019s choices, sustain his\nintegrity, and are sources of specific obligations to his pupils,\nfellows, and friends. However, we do not have obligations just because\nwe occupy certain roles as teachers, citizens, or friends. Rather,\nsuch roles become practical identities, and sources of reasons,\ninsofar as we reflectively endorse them (Korsgaard 1996a: \u00a73.3.1;\nKorsgaard 2009: 22). Reflective endorsement, in turn, requires that we\ntest our loyalties and allegiances according to the principle of\nuniversality, which commits us to morality. In order to value\nourselves under these specific descriptions, we must value humanity in\nourselves and in others (Korsgaard 2008: Lecture 6, 25\u201326).\n\nKorsgaard (1996a) offers a transcendental argument for the conclusion\nthat what we ought to do is justified by the norms that govern and\nconstitute our rational agency. She argues that valuing humanity,\nwhere humanity is understood as the capacity for rationality, is the\ncondition of the possibility of valuing anything at all (Korsgaard\n1996a: 121\u2013123; Korsgaard 1998: 60\u201362). In deliberating,\nwe attribute to ourselves the power to confer value on our ends\nby rationally choosing them. According to Korsgaard, in\nvaluing we are also, at the same time, attributing a fundamental kind\nof value to ourselves. The conclusion is that the value of any objects\nthus ultimately depends on the rational capacity of evaluators.\n\u2018Humanity\u2019 is the name of a distinctive value, which is\nunconditional and counts as the condition of the possibility of\nvaluing anything at all. Since humanity is embodied in all rational\nbeings, we should value humanity in ourselves as well as in others, on\npain of incoherence. Special obligations and bonds that derive from\nour practical identities are insufficient to sustain our integrity\nwhen they are inconsistent with valuing humanity. For instance, the\nconduct of a Mafioso cannot be coherently justified on the basis of a\nuniversal principle. The Mafioso thus fails as a rational agent and\nleads a life that is not autonomous, because his life is not the\nproduct of reflective self-government. A systematic failure to be\nguided by universal principles of self-government amounts to a loss of\nagency. Insofar as agency is inescapable, we are necessarily bound by\nthe norms of rationality and morality. Korsgaard argues that some kind\nof integrity is necessary to be an agent and cannot be achieved\nwithout a commitment to morality, which is founded on reason.\n\nSome critics argue that Korsgaard\u2019s argument rests on realist\npremises, and thus it is not a complete alternative to moral realism\n(Watkins & Fitzpatrick 2002; Fitzpatrick 2005; Ridge 2005; Stieb\n2006; Kain 2006a,b; Papish 2011; O\u2019Shea 2015; Schafer 2015a. To\nthis extent, her defense of Kantian constructivism does not offer a\ndistinctive reply to skeptical challenges to ethical objectivity.\nAccording to others, Korsgaard\u2019s argument is vulnerable to the\nobjection of \u2018regress on conditions\u2019, which says that it\nis not logically necessary that the condition of a thing\u2019s value\nbe valuable itself (Rabinowicz & R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2000;\nKerstein 2001; Ridge 2005; Coleman 2006). That is to say that humanity\nmay be the condition of the possibility of value and yet lack value\nitself.\n\nHowever, according to Korsgaard \u201cthere need be no such regress\nif there are principles that are constitutive of the very\nrational activities that we trying to perform\u201d (2008: 5, 1996b:\n164\u201367, 2009) In this formulation, the principles of practical\nrationality are constitutive of rational agency, in the sense that\nthey are standards arising from and justified by the nature of the\nobject in question (i.e., the rational agent). More specifically,\nunless the object conforms to the standard, it ceases to be the kind\nof object that it is. This is called the \u2018constitution\nrequirement.\u2019 If the function of the house is to serve as a\nhabitable shelter, then it must conform to the standard of being a\nhabitable shelter. A thing that does not serve this purpose is not a\nhouse. Secondly, some objects make themselves into the kind\nof objects that they are by conforming to their constitutive\nstandards. This is called the \u2018self-constitution\nrequirement.\u2019 Rational agents make things happen, that is, they\nare efficacious. They exert their efficacy in a specific way, i.e.,\nautonomously. Autonomous agents must conform to the categorical\nimperative, and in order to be efficacious, they must conform to the\nhypothetical imperative. It is by conforming to these principles,\nKorsgaard argues, that one makes oneself into an agent.\n\nKorsgaard\u2019s constitutivist strategy of grounding normativity in\nthe constitutive features of agency raises worries that will be\ndiscussed in\n section 7.\n Her more recent works point toward a new direction in the debate\nabout constructivism, which combines Aristotelian and Kantian features\n(Korsgaard 2009). Korsgaard argues that an Aristotelian account of the\nvirtues as excellences of character should play an important role in a\ncomplete account of what makes a good moral agent. However, she\nremains convinced that the Kantian idea of self-constitution is\nindispensable for giving an account of agency, and therefore of moral\nagency, itself.\n",
