    "main_text": "\n\nReference is a relation that obtains between certain sorts of\nrepresentational tokens and objects. For instance, when I assert that\n\u201cBarack Obama is a Democrat,\u201d I use a particular sort of\nrepresentational token\u2014i.e. the name \u2018Barack\nObama\u2019\u2014which refers to a particular individual\u2014i.e. \nBarack Obama. While names and other referential terms are\nhardly the only type of representational token capable of referring\n(consider, for instance, concepts, mental maps, and pictures),\nlinguistic tokens like these have long stood at the center of\nphilosophical inquiries into the nature of reference. Accordingly,\nthis entry will focus primarily on linguistic\n reference.[1]\n\n\nAssuming that at least some token linguistic expressions really do\nrefer, a number of interesting questions arise. How, for example, does\nlinguistic reference relate to the act of referring\u2014something\nthat we as speakers do with referential terms? How exactly do\nreferential terms come to refer? That is, in virtue of what do they\nrefer to what they do? Is there a single answer to this question, a\nsingle mechanism of reference, or different answers depending on the\nsort of term in question? And what exactly is the relationship\nbetween reference and meaning? Answers to these various questions will\nturn out to be closely related; the task of this entry will be to\ntrace out some of the main clusters of answers.\n",
