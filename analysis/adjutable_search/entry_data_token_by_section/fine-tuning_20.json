    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and Naturalness || Violations of Naturalness: Examples\n5.3 Violations of Naturalness and Fine-Tuning for Life\n\nAs explained in\n Section 5.1,\n violations of naturalness can be seen as instances of fine-tuning,\nbut not in the sense of fine-tuning for life. A connection between\nnaturalness and fine-tuning for life can be constructed, however,\nalong the following lines:\n\nOne can interpret equations \\(\\eqref{Higgs}\\) and\n\\(\\eqref{cosmo_constant}\\) as suggesting that the actual physical\nvalues of the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant are much\nsmaller than the values that one would expect for them in the\nframework of the Standard Model. Notably, if the Higgs mass were of\norder of the cut-off \\(\\Lambda\\), e.g., the Planck scale, and if the\ncosmological constant were of order \\(\\Lambda^4\\), the bare parameters\nwould not need to be fixed to many digits in order for the physical\nparameters to have their respective orders of magnitude, which means\nthat the physical values would be natural. Thus, assuming naturalness\nand the validity of our currently best physical theories up to the\nPlanck scale, one would expect values for the Higgs mass and the\ncosmological constants of the same order of magnitude as their vacuum\ncontributions, i.e., values much larger than the actual ones.\n\nWith respect to the problem of specifying probability distributions\nover possible values of physical parameters discussed in\n Section 2.1\n naturalness may be taken to suggest that all reasonable such\ndistributions have most of their probabilistic weight close to the\nnatural values. As explained, for the Higgs mass and the\ncosmological constant the natural values are much larger than the\nobserved ones. Advocates of the view that fine-tuning for life\nrequires a response because life-friendly constants are improbable\ntherefore put particular emphasis on those instances of fine-tuning\nfor life that are associated with violations of naturalness, notably\nthe cosmological constant (e.g., Susskind 2005: ch. 2; Donoghue 2007;\nCollins 2009: sect. 2.3.3; Tegmark 2014: 140f.).\n",
