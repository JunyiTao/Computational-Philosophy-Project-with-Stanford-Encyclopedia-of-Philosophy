Nevertheless, Bolzano\u2019s ethics contains also\nessential elements of Kantian ethics, and there is even a basic\ncoincidence between Bolzano\u2019s and Kant\u2019s ethics. The only\nthing that can be regarded as good without qualification, according to\nKant, is a good will (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,\n1785, 1). Yet (as we will see in section 5.4), it is a basic postulate\nof Bolzano\u2019s deontic logic that an ought always primarily refers\nto a willing: You ought to will to act such that the welfare\nof the whole, due to the consequences foreseeable by you and intended\nby your action, undergoes the greatest possible advancement among all\npossible alternative actions. Bolzano himself infers from this: The\nsupreme moral law demands \u201cproperly only a willing, not the\naccomplishment\u201d (RW IV, 207).\n\nWhat is primarily judged as obligatory or forbidden is not the act,\nbut a willing or decision, as Bolzano emphasizes. An action that is\nwilled must thus be assessed according to those consequences which the\nagent thereby intends or wills to achieve: For an\naction to be morally good it is not enough, as we have already seen\n(at the end of section 5.2), that it is in accordance with the moral\nlaw, but it must be undertaken also with the intention for it\nto be so (RW IV, 266), i.e., due to the moral law (RW IV,\n269). In this manner Bolzano abandons the scope of the purely\nconsequentialist position which claims that the moral assessment of an\naction or of the willing-an-action as being obligatory, permissible or\nforbidden depends solely on its consequences. Bolzano\u2019s\nutilitarianism is consequently not a purely consequentialist normative\ntheory, but rather a mixed theory. In presenting such a mixed\nethical theory, Bolzano came already close to a modern conception of\nethics (such as, e.g., that outlined in William K. Frankena\u2019s\nEthics, 2nd edition, 1973, 43 ff.) which is very common\nwithin today\u2019s applied ethics.\n",
