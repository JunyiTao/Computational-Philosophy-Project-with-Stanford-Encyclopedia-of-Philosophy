    "main_text": "Biography || Early Life\n1.1 Early Life\n\nJos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset was born on May 9, 1883, in Madrid, the\nsecond of four children by Jos\u00e9 Ortega Munilla and Dolores\nGasset Chinchilla. Eduardo Ortega y Gasset, his brother, was born in\nApril 1882, and after Jos\u00e9, Rafaela in 1884 and Manuel in 1885.\nHis mother was the daughter of Eduardo Gasset y Artime, founder of\nEl Imparcial, the eminent liberal daily newspaper; Ortega\ndivided his time between creative writing and serving as the editor of\nthe family enterprise from 1900 to 1906. From September 1891 to 1897,\nOrtega and his brother Eduardo were enrolled in the Jesuit Collegio de\nSan Estanislao de Kostka in Miraflores del Palo in M\u00e1laga,\nwhere he studied Greek and other subjects under the tutelage of Father\nGonzalo Colomer and received his bachillerato. In November\n1897, young Ortega enrolled in the Jesuit University of Deusto, in\nBilbao, accompanied by Father Colomer, for the purpose of studying\nphilology and Greek under the renowned scholar Julio Cejador y Frauca.\nHe remained in Deusto, studying philosophy, letters, and law, until\nMay 13, 1898, when he was awarded distinction in his first-year\nexaminations at the University of Salamanca. Miguel de Unamuno, an\neminent figure in Spanish intellectual circles and dean of the\nfaculty, served on the panel of examiners. The following year, Ortega\ntransferred to the Central University of Madrid from which he received\nhis licenciatura in philosophy and letters in June 1902, and\nhis doctorate in December 1904. He wrote his thesis on The Terrors\nof the Year One Thousand in which an early interest in a general\ninterpretive approach to history, with a view toward the sociological\nmanifestations of a historical period, became evident. While at the\nCentral University of Madrid, Ortega developed a close friendship with\nRamiro de Maeztu with whom he shared an enthusiasm for Friedrich\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophy. In 1904, the year prior to his departure for\nGermany, Ortega wrote his first article for the El Imparcial,\nthe family newspaper, on the Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck.\n",
