    "main_text": "\n\n\nArthur Prior (1914\u20131969) undertook pioneering work in\nintensional logic at a time when modality and intensional concepts in\ngeneral were under attack. He invented tense logic and was principal\ntheoretician of the movement to apply modal syntax to the formalisation\nof a wide variety of phenomena. Prior and Carew Meredith devised a\nversion of the possible worlds semantics several years before Saul\nKripke published his first paper on the topic. An iconoclast and a\nresourceful innovator, Prior inspired many to undertake work in\nintensional logic.\n\n\nMuch of Prior\u2019s research consisted of the tireless exploration\nof a labyrinth of axiomatic calculi. Yet for him the point of a logical\ncalculus was always that it had a subject matter, be it time,\nobligation, agency, or even biology, and a concern for philosophical\nproblems never lay far below his theorems. It was the extra-symbolic\nworld that mattered to Prior, not the formal results per se. He\nwrote:\n\n\n\nPhilosophy, including Logic, is not primarily about language, but\nabout the real world. \u2026 Formalism, i.e. the theory that Logic is\njust about symbols and not things, is false. Nevertheless, it is\nimportant to \u2018formalise\u2019 as much as we can, i.e. to state\ntruths about things in a rigorous language with a known and explicit\nstructure. (1996a: 45)\n\n\nThe first New Zealand-born logician, Prior was the founding father of\nlogic in New Zealand and also a driving force behind the renaissance\nin British logic from 1956.\n",
