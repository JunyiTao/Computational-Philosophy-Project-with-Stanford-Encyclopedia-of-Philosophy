    "main_text": "The Essay on Education || Education and Happiness\n6.4 Education and Happiness\nJames Mill thought that \u201cof all the circumstances which affect the happiness, the beauty, and order, and well-being of society, by far the most important\u201d is individual character (Mill 1813a, 97). The shaping of character was no simple matter. From the domestic to the political sphere, many institutions played a part in the \u201celevation of the people\u201d: elevation \u201cabove ignorance, above swinishness, above prostitute servility, above oppression, above delusion religious or political, above grovelling vice, above subjection to the irrational passions\u201d (Mill 1813c, 345; Plassart 2008 and 2019). To adapt a famous Stoic idea, as we move from the inner to the outer concentric circles of affection and concern for one's self and for others, it becomes increasingly difficult (impossible even without conducive physical and moral circumstances), to abstain from doing harm or do positive good to others. As we saw, without strong associations, the knowing subject\u2019s mind hardly takes cognizance of the interests or even the existence of others outside the narrow circle of one's self, family, friends and associates.\nThe effects of misguided associations, Mill urged, require \u201cthe greatest attention in Education, and Morals\u201d: the \u201clove of our Fellow-creatures\u201d is \u201ccompletely impotent\u201d against the \u201clove of Wealth, or of Power.\u201d Good education strengthens virtuous motives so that they do not \u201cgive way, habitually, whenever they are opposed by any other motive even of moderate strength\u201d (Mill 1829a, II.241). As he put it:\nWhen the grand sources of felicity are formed into the leading and governing Ideas, each in its due and relative strength, Education has then performed its most perfect work; and thus the individual becomes, to the greatest degree, the source of utility to others, and of happiness to himself (Mill 1829a, II.303).\nOnly when one cares enough to sacrifice that \u201cpart of the self which the good of our species requires\u201d (Mill 1818, V.527) can individual exertion be directed towards the pursuit of social happiness. But it was a pursuit neither for the narrow-minded nor for the faint-hearted. For this reason, Mill thought that no great public good could \u201crest with safety on any thing so precarious, as the chance of extraordinary virtue in particular men\u201d (Mill 1816, 248). \u201cIs it according to the experience of human nature, that men with the powers of government in their hands are angels and have never any propensity to oppress?\u201d, he wondered (Mill 1813d, 464).\n",
