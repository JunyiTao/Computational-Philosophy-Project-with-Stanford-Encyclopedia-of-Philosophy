    "main_text": "Kinds of Associations || Collective Associations\n1.2 Collective Associations\n\n\u201cCollective\u201d is a catchword for a smorgasbord of\nassociations, from chess clubs, to trade unions, churches and\nbusinesses, which are usually not dyadic, and which have a primary\nfunction other than associating as such. We can distinguish different\ncollective associations according to their primary functions, again\nrecognizing that a given association can perform multiple functions,\nincluding those functions closer in spirit to intimate\nassociations.\n\nEducational associations are an important early form of\nassociation outside the family and perhaps, more than any other,\nillustrate the fluidity of associational types. Children associate\nnon-voluntarily with teachers (hierarchical) and with peers\n(non-hierarchical), and thereby learn many of the social skills needed\nto make good on their rights of association within the wider world.\nSchool is most often assessed with a view to its important\ninstrumental purposes, particularly for future, work-related\nimperatives, but is equally a site of often intense and long-lasting\nintimate relationships.\n\nExpressive associations aim to give a larger microphone\nto a set of people than they would have individually, and can thus\noften serve to check the powers of other associations, interest\ngroups, governments, and state bureaucracies (Craiutu 2008:\n266\u20137). Expressive associations include not only advocacy groups\nand civil rights groups, but also segregationist groups and xenophobic\ngroups. Examples of expressive associations include the ACLU, the\nNAACP, Amnesty International, the LGBTQIA community, the NRA, and the\nKKK. In addition to lending people a larger microphone, such\nassociations can also serve a simpler, cathartic or identify-affirming\nfunction, enabling members to solidify through joint expression their\nsense of what they value (Farber 2001: 1494ff).\n Recreational associations for the joint enjoyment of\nhobbies are not paradigmatically expressive, but instead are\npleasure-oriented or progress-oriented. The members of a chess club do\nexpress a fondness for chess, but the primary function is to play and\nlearn about chess, not to express that fondness.\nCommercial and professional associations often consume\nmore time in our day than our intimate connections do. Work\nassociations can include collegiate relationships, trade unions,\nguilds, networking groups, and business groups. Such connections are\nalmost invariably shaped by important associative asymmetries between\nemployees\u2019 and employers\u2019 rights to decide about\nmembership and associative activities (White 1998: 337).\nThe free association of producers, as it occurs in\nMarxism and some anarchist literature, points to a variation in the\nidea that employees have associative freedom, highlighting a deeper\ncritique of the very concept of freedom of association. Given\nthat work is, for most of us, an associational form of activity that\nwe are compelled to undertake\u2014on pain of potentially severe\nsuffering\u2014and over which we often have little control, Marxists\nwonder how free we can really be in our associative decisions (Gorz\n1997 [1999]; James 2017: 285).\nIntentional communities sit somewhere between clans and\nneighborhoods and nations. Such communities lack the organic\nspontaneity that usually typifies residential communities. Instead,\nthese communities arise when people with similar interests,\nideologies, and concerns come together to share those things in\nsubstantial ways. Often this sharing has an ecological aspect, as with\ncommunes, or a concern with security and property values, as with\ngated communities (Low 2003: 151\u2013172). But, it can also be\nenacted by far-right political groups looking to preserve racial\ncultures which they perceive as under threat by the majority\nculture.\nNational and state associations, like our childhood\nfamily environments, are non-voluntary. We are born within a nation or\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction, and are compelled to associate at some\nlevel with the other people who fall under that jurisdiction. If we\nhave adequate resources, we may leave. But, we will only end up within\nthe circle of another such association (Dworkin 1986: 192\u2013193).\nSimilarly, if we are forced out, we will find ourselves within another\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction. Our state or national associations\ninevitably impact on our other associations, the social norms that\ndefine our families, the associative interests we develop, and the\npatterns of socialization we undergo at school, in churches, in clubs,\nand at work (Walzer 2004: 14\u201315). Moreover, the ways that\nnations and states are organized, being defined with and restricted by\nborders, limits who we, as employers, workers and potential partners,\nget to interact with and who gets to interact with us (Carens 1987:\n253; Kukathas 2005: 210).\n",
