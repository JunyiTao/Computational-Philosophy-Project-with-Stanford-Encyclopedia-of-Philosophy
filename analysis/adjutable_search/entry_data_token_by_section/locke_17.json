    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || The Social Contract Theory\n4.5 The Social Contract Theory\n\nJust as natural rights and natural law theory had a fluorescence in\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth century, so did the social contract\ntheory. Why is Locke a social contract theorist? Is it merely that\nthis was one prevailing way of thinking about government at the time\nwhich Locke blindly adopted? The answer is that there is something\nabout Locke\u2019s project which pushes him strongly in the direction\nof the social contract. One might hold that governments were\noriginally instituted by force, and that no agreement was involved.\nWere Locke to adopt this view, he would be forced to go back on many\nof the things which are at the heart of his project in the Second\nTreatise, though cases like the Norman conquest force him to\nadmit that citizens may come to accept a government that was\noriginally forced on them. Remember that the Second Treatise\nprovides Locke\u2019s positive theory of government, and that he\nexplicitly says that he must provide an alternative to the view\n\n\nthat all government in the world is merely the product of force and\nviolence, and that men live together by no other rules than that of\nthe beasts, where the strongest carries it \u2026 .\n(Treatises II, 1, 4)\n\n\nSo, while Locke might admit that some governments come about through\nforce or violence, he would be destroying the most central and vital\ndistinction, that between legitimate and illegitimate civil\ngovernment, if he admitted that legitimate government can come about\nin this way. So, for Locke, legitimate government is instituted by the\nexplicit consent of those governed. (See the section on\n consent, political obligation, and the ends of government\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s political philosophy.) Those who make\nthis agreement transfer to the government their right of executing the\nlaw of nature and judging their own case. These are the powers which\nthey give to the central government, and this is what makes the\njustice system of governments a legitimate function of such\ngovernments.\n\nRuth Grant has persuasively argued that the establishment of\ngovernment is in effect a two step process. Universal consent is\nnecessary to form a political community. Consent to join a community\nonce given is binding and cannot be withdrawn. This makes political\ncommunities stable. Grant writes: \u201cHaving established that the\nmembership in a community entails the obligation to abide by the will\nof the community, the question remains: Who rules?\u201d (1987:\n114\u2013115). The answer to this question is determined by majority\nrule. The point is that universal consent is necessary to establish a\npolitical community, majority consent to answer the question who is to\nrule such a community. Universal consent and majority consent are thus\ndifferent in kind, not just in degree. Grant writes:\n\n\nLocke\u2019s argument for the right of the majority is the\ntheoretical ground for the distinction between duty to society and\nduty to government, the distinction that permits an argument for\nresistance without anarchy. When the designated government dissolves,\nmen remain obligated to society acting through majority rule. (1987:\n119)\n\n\nIt is entirely possible for the majority to confer the rule of the\ncommunity on a king and his heirs, or a group of oligarchs or on a\ndemocratic assembly. Thus, the social contract is not inextricably\nlinked to democracy. Still, a government of any kind must perform the\nlegitimate function of a civil government.\n",
