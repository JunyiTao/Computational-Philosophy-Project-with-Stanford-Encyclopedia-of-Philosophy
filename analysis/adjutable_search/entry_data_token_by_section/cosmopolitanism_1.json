    "main_text": "History of Cosmopolitanisms || Early Modern and Enlightenment Cosmopolitanism\n1.2 Early Modern and Enlightenment Cosmopolitanism\n\n\nCosmopolitanism slowly began to come to the fore again with the\nrenewed study of more ancient texts, but during the humanist era\ncosmopolitanism still remained the exception. Despite the fact that\nancient cosmopolitan sources were well-known and that many humanists\nemphasized the essential unity of all religions, they did not develop\nthis idea in cosmopolitan terms. A few authors, however, most notably\nErasmus of Rotterdam, explicitly drew on ancient cosmopolitanism to\nadvocate the ideal of a world-wide peace. Emphasizing the unity of\nhumankind over its division into different states and peoples, by\narguing that humans are destined by Nature to be sociable and live in\nharmony, Erasmus pleaded for national and religious tolerance and\nregarded like-minded people as his compatriots (Querela\nPacis).\n\n\nEarly modern natural law theory might seem a likely candidate for\nspawning philosophical cosmopolitanism. Its secularizing tendencies and\nthe widespread individualist view among its defenders that all humans\nshare certain fundamental characteristics would seem to suggest a point\nof unification for humankind as a whole. However, according to many\nearly modern theorists, what all individuals share is a fundamental\nstriving for self-preservation, and the universality of this striving\ndoes not amount to a fundamental bond that unites (or should unite) all\nhumans in a universal community.\n\n\nStill, there are two factors that do sometimes push modern natural\nlaw theory in a cosmopolitan direction.  First, some\nnatural law theorists assume that nature implanted in humans, in\naddition to the tendency to self-preservation, also a\nfellow-feeling, a form of sociability that unites all humans at a\nfundamental level into a kind of world community. The appeal to such a\nshared human bond was very thin, however, and by no means does it\nnecessarily lead to cosmopolitanism. In fact, the very notion of a\nnatural sociability was sometimes used instead to legitimate war\nagainst peoples elsewhere in the world who were said to have violated\nthis common bond in an \u2018unnatural\u2019 way, or who were easily\nsaid to have placed themselves outside of the domain of common human\nmorality by their \u2018barbaric\u2019 customs. Second, early modern\nnatural law theory was often connected with social contract theory, and\nalthough most social contract theorists worked out their views mostly,\nif not solely, for the level of the state and not for that of\ninternational relations, the very idea behind social contract theory\nlends itself for application to this second level. Grotius, Pufendorf,\nand others did draw out these implications and thereby laid the\nfoundation for international law. Grotius envisioned a \u201cgreat\nsociety of states\u201d that is bound by a \u201claw of\nnations\u201d that holds \u201cbetween all states\u201d (De Iure\nBelli ac Paci, 1625, Prolegomena par. 17; Pufendorf, De Iure\nNaturae et Gentium, 1672).\n\n\nThe historical context of the philosophical resurgence of\ncosmopolitanism during the Enlightenment is made up of many factors:\nThe increasing rise of capitalism and world-wide trade and its\ntheoretical reflections; the reality of ever expanding empires whose\nreach extended across the globe; the voyages around the world and the\nanthropological so-called \u2018discoveries\u2019 facilitated through\nthese; the renewed interest in Hellenistic philosophy; and the\nemergence of a notion of human rights and a philosophical focus on\nhuman reason. Many intellectuals of the time regarded their membership\nin the transnational \u2018republic of letters\u2019 as more\nsignificant than their membership in the particular political states\nthey found themselves in, all the more so because their relationship\nwith their government was often strained because of censorship issues.\nThis prepared them to think in terms other than those of states and\npeoples and adopt a cosmopolitan perspective. Under the influence of\nthe American Revolution, and especially during the first years of the\nFrench Revolution, cosmopolitanism received its strongest impulse. The\n1789 declaration of \u2018human\u2019 rights had grown out of\ncosmopolitan modes of thinking and reinforced them in turn.\n\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the terms \u2018cosmopolitanism\u2019\nand \u2018world citizenship\u2019 were often used not as labels for\ndeterminate philosophical theories, but rather to indicate an attitude\nof open-mindedness and impartiality. A cosmopolitan was someone who was\nnot subservient to a particular religious or political authority,\nsomeone who was not biased by particular loyalties or cultural\nprejudice. Furthermore, the term was sometimes used to indicate a\nperson who led an urbane life-style, or who was fond of traveling,\ncherished a network of international contacts, or felt at home\neverywhere. In this sense the Encyclop\u00e9die mentioned that\n\u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 was often used to signify a \u201cman of no\nfixed abode, or a man who is nowhere a stranger.\u201d Though\nphilosophical authors such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, Addison,\nHume, and Jefferson identified themselves as cosmopolitans in one or\nmore of these senses, these usages are not of much philosophical\ninterest.\n\n\nEspecially in the second half of the century, however, the term was\nincreasingly also used to indicate particular philosophical\nconvictions. Some authors revived the Cynic tradition. Fougeret de\nMontbron in his 1753 autobiographical report, Le Cosmopolite,\ncalls himself a cosmopolitan, describes how he travels everywhere\nwithout being committed to anywhere, declaring \u201cAll the countries\nare the same to me\u201d and \u201c[I am] changing my places of\nresidence according to my whim\u201d (p. 130).\n\n\nDespite the fact that only a few authors committed\nthemselves to this kind of cosmopolitanism, this was the version that\ncritics of cosmopolitanism took as their target. For example, Rousseau\ncomplains that cosmopolitans \u201cboast that they love everyone\n[tout le monde, which also means \u2018the whole\nworld\u2019], to have the right to love no one\u201d (Geneva\nManuscript version of The Social Contract, 158). Johann Georg\nSchlosser, in the critical poem \u2018Der Kosmopolit\u2019 writes,\n\u201cIt is better to be proud of one\u2019s nation than to have\nnone,\u201d obviously assuming that cosmopolitanism implies the\nlatter.\n\n\nYet most eighteenth-century defenders of cosmopolitanism did not\nrecognize their own view in these critical descriptions. They\nunderstood cosmopolitanism not as a form of ultra-individualism, but\nrather, drawing on the Stoic tradition, as implying the positive moral\nideal of a universal human community, and they did not regard this\nideal as inimical to more particular attachments. \nSome, like the German author Christoph Martin Wieland, stayed quite\nclose to Stoic views. Others developed a cosmopolitan moral theory that\nwas distinctively new. According to Kant, all rational beings are\nmembers in a single moral community. They are analogous to citizens in\nthe political (republican) sense in that they share the characteristics\nof freedom, equality, and independence, and that they live under their own laws. Their common laws, however, are the laws of morality, grounded\nin reason. Early utilitarian cosmopolitans like Jeremy Bentham, by\ncontrast, defended their cosmopolitanism by pointing to the\n\u201ccommon and equal utility of all nations.\u201d Moral\ncosmopolitanism could be grounded in human reason, or in some other\ncharacteristic universally shared among humans (and in some cases other\nkinds of beings) such as the capacity to experience pleasure or pain, a\nmoral sense, or the aesthetic imagination. Moral cosmopolitans regarded\nall humans as \u2018brothers\u2019 \u2013 an analogy with which they aimed to indicate the fundamental\nequality of rank of all humans, which precluded slavery, colonial\nexploitation, feudal hierarchy, and tutelage of various sorts. As the term \u2018brothers\u2019 indicates, however, this does not mean that their own thought was always free from bias and inconsistency. Indeed, numerous authors combined their moral cosmopolitanism with a defense of the superiority of men over women, or that of \u201cwhites\u201d over other \u201craces.\u201d A notable example is Kant, who defended European colonialism before he became very critical of it in the mid 1790s (Kleingeld 2014), and who never gave up the view that women were inferior to men in morally relevant respects.\n\n\nSome cosmopolitans developed their view into a political theory\nabout international relations. The most radical of eighteenth-century\npolitical cosmopolitans was no doubt Anacharsis Cloots (Jean-Baptiste\ndu Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots, 1755\u20131794). Cloots advocated the\nabolition of all existing states and the establishment of a single\nworld state under which all human individuals would be directly\nsubsumed. His arguments drew first of all on the general structure of\nsocial contract theory. If it is in the general interest for everyone\nto submit to the authority of a state that enforces laws that provide\nsecurity, then this argument applies world-wide and justifies the\nestablishment of a world-wide \u201crepublic of united\nindividuals,\u201d not a plurality of states that find themselves in\nthe state of nature vis-\u00e0-vis each other. Second, he argues that\nsovereignty should reside with the people, and that the concept of\nsovereignty itself, because it involves indivisibility, implies that\nthere can be but one sovereign body in the world, namely, the human\nrace as a whole (La r\u00e9publique universelle ou adresse aux\ntyrannicides, 1792; Bases constitutionelles de la\nr\u00e9publique du genre humain, 1793).\nMost other political cosmopolitans did not go as far as\nCloots. Immanuel Kant, most famously, advocated a much weaker form of\ninternational legal order, namely, that of a \u2018league of\nnations.\u2019 In Toward Perpetual Peace (1795) Kant argues\nthat true and world-wide peace is possible only when states organize\nthemselves internally according to \u2018republican\u2019\nprinciples, when they organize themselves externally in a voluntary\nleague for the sake of keeping peace, and when they respect the human\nrights not only of their citizens but also of foreigners. He argues\nthat the league of states should not have coercive military powers\nbecause that would violate the internal sovereignty of states. \nSome critics argued in response that Kant\u2019s position was\ninconsistent, because on their view, the only way to fully overcome\nthe state of nature among states was for the latter to enter into a\nfederative union with coercive powers. The early Fichte transformed\nthe concept of sovereignty in the process, by conceiving it as\nlayered, and this enabled them to argue that states ought to transfer\npart of their sovereignty to the federal level, but only that part\nthat concerns their external relations to other states, while\nretaining the sovereignty of the states concerning their internal\naffairs. Romantic authors, on the other hand, felt that the ideal\nstate should not have to involve coercion at all, and hence also that\nthe cosmopolitan ideal should be that of a world-wide republic of\n\u2018fraternal\u2019 non-authoritarian republics (the young\nFriedrich Schlegel).\nEspecially the first objection has been repeated ever since, but\nmore recent interpretations have questioned its legitimacy (Kleingeld\n2004, 2012), arguing that Kant can also be read as advocating the\nloose league as a first step on the road toward a federation with\ncoercive powers. Because joining this stronger form of federation\nshould be a voluntary decision on the part of the peoples involved, to\nhonor their political autonomy, the strong federation is not a matter\nof coercive international right. On this interpretation, Kant\u2019s\ndefense of the loose league is much more consistent. \n\n\nKant also introduced the concept of \u201ccosmopolitan law,\u201d suggesting a\nthird sphere of public law \u2013 in addition to constitutional law\nand international law \u2013 in which both states and individuals\nhave rights, and where individuals have these rights as \u201ccitizens of\nthe earth\u201d rather than as citizens of particular states.\nIn addition to moral and political forms of cosmopolitanism, there\nemerged an economic form of cosmopolitan theory. The freer trade\nadvocated by eighteenth-century anti-mercantilists, especially Adam\nSmith, was developed further into the ideal of a global free market by\nDietrich Hermann Hegewisch (Kleingeld 2012). His ideal was a world in\nwhich tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade are abolished, a\nworld in which the market, not the government, takes care of the needs\nof the people. Against mercantilism, he argued that it is more\nadvantageous for everyone involved if a nation imports those goods\nwhich are more expensive to produce domestically, and that the\nabolition of protectionism would benefit everyone. If other states\nwere to gain from their exports, they would reach a higher standard of\nliving and become even better trading partners, because they could\nthen import more, too. Moreover, on Hegewisch\u2019s view, after trade will\nhave been liberalized world-wide, the importance of national\ngovernments will diminish dramatically. As national governments are\nmostly focused on the national economy and defense, he argued, their\nfuture role will be at most auxiliary. The freer the global market\nbecomes, the more the role of the states will become negligible.\n",
