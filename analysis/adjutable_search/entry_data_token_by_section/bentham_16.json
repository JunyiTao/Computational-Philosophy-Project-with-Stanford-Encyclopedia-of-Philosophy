    "main_text": "Administration, Government, Constitutional Law || Sovereignty\n9.2 Sovereignty\n\nThe popular dimensions of the constitutional code appear to run\ncontrary to the legal positivism commonly associated with\nBentham\u2019s utilitarianism, which implies a theory of sovereignty\nthat requires that power be located in the hands of the legislator,\nhowever constituted, and stipulates that all laws are imperative and\ndepend for their enforcement on coercive sanctions. Rosen has argued\nthat as early as A Fragment on Government, Bentham rejected\nthe Hobbesian idea of sovereignty based on simple command and\nobedience, in which the sovereign is necessarily a single, unified\nsupreme power, in favour of \u201cthe notions of the legal limitation\nand division of sovereign power\u201d (Rosen 1983, 41, 44).\n\nGenerally, by the term \u201csovereignty\u201d Bentham meant the\npower to legislate (legal sovereignty), but he also employed it in\nrelation to the power of the people to limit or control government and\npublic officials (political or popular sovereignty). In the first\nsense of the term it is seemingly impossible for there to be a law\nthat deliberately functions contrary to the will of the legislature.\nAll law emanates from the will of the sovereign and the will of the\nsovereign \u201ccannot be illegal\u201d (2010b, 38). However,\nBentham also held that all political authority, no matter what form it\ntakes, is necessarily limited by its capacity to compel obedience from\nthe people. As he put it in A Fragment on Government,\n\u201cBy a sovereign I mean any person or assemblage of persons to\nwhose will a whole political community are (no matter on what account)\nsupposed to be in a disposition to pay obedience\u201d (1977, 18).\nAnd in Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence he\nexplained that this implies two volitions, both of which are necessary\ncomponents of a complete theory of sovereignty: on the one hand, the\nenactments of a legislature and, on the other, the will of the people\nto obey those enactments. In effect, the will of the people to disobey\namounts to a permanent constitutional check on the authority of the\nsovereign, and in this sense \u201cthe submission and obedience of\nthe people\u201d acts as the \u201cconstituent cause\u201d of\nsovereignty (2010b 150n). The legislature may be \u201csupreme\u201d\nbut it \u201ccan never of itself be absolute and unlimited\u201d or\n\u201camount to the entire power of imperation\u201d (113). The\nresult is a \u201csplit concept\u201d of sovereignty defined by a\ndynamic interaction between the legislature and the people, subject to\nchanging times and the reflection of this in the public\u2019s\nattitude to law, to what is admissible and inadmissible (see Ben-Dor\n2000, Ch. 2). The process of public deliberation and accountability\nthis requires is greatly facilitated by the communicative freedoms of\nthe \u201cliberty of the press\u201d and the \u201cliberty of\npublic association\u201d (1977, 485)\u2014crystalized in\nBentham\u2019s conception of the \u201cPublic Opinion\nTribunal\u201d (POT).\n",
