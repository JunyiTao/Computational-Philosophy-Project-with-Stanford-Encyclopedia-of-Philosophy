In fact, relativistic\ncosmology predicts its own invalidity for times close to a dynamic\nsingularity, such as the big bang. (For a dissenting opinion, see\nMisner 1969.) The reason that relativistic cosmology predicts its own\nown invalidity is that in the neighborhood of singularities,\ngravitational effects are intense, and quantum effects can be expected\nto play a predominant role. But general relativity does not\nincorporate quantum effects, and indeed it is untested in such regimes\nof intense gravitational force. Thus, there is little reason to\nbelieve that the singularity theorems make a valid prediction about\nthe structure of a future successor theory of general relativity that\nincludes quantum effects. We discuss this issue further in Section\n4.\n",
