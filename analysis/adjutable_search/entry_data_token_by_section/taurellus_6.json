    "main_text": "Emanative Causation and the Problem of the Eternity of the World\n7. Aftermath\n\nAlthough Taurellus\u2019s publications in metaphysics can be read as\na sustained philosophical defense of the Christian doctrine of\ncreation, his work triggered polemical opposition from orthodox\nLutheran theologians (see Feuerlein 1734). Apart from blatantly\nmisguided but highly derogatory allegations of atheism, some of his\ncontemporaries saw a connection between Taurellus\u2019s views and\nthe views of two other controversial thinkers. One of them is the\natomistic natural philosopher David Gorlaeus (1591\u20131612), the\nother is the Arminian theologian Conrad Vorstius (1569\u20131622)\n(L\u00fcthy 2001: 278\u2013286, L\u00fcthy 2012: 122\u2013129, and\nL\u00fcthy 2018).\n\nThe connection between Taurellus and Gorlaeus seems to be particularly\ndirect because Gorlaeus develops a long series of arguments in support\nof the claim that a human being is \u201cone being by aggregation,\nnot by essence\u201d (Gorlaeus 1620: 222\u2013234; on Gorlaeaus, see\nLasswitz 1890: vol. 1, pp. 455\u2013463; Gregory 1966: 46\u201351;\nL\u00fcthy 2012). Moreover, to spell out the implications of such a\nview of composites Gorlaeus presents a fully developed theory of\nmaterial atoms, according to which nature is constituted by minimal,\nquantitative, indivisible, and corporeal particles interspersed with\nsmall regions of vacuum (Gorlaeus 1620: 239\u2013243). The close\nconnection between the endorsement of the existence of material atoms\nand the denial of the existence of composite unities in Gorlaeus made\nit tempting for Taurellus\u2019s contemporaries to conjecture that\nsuch a close connection could be found also in Taurellus (see Voetius\n1643: 28). However, a close look into Taurellus\u2019s account of\nelements (see above\n section 2)\n shows that the unities that produce beings \u201cby\naggregation\u201d are not to be understood in analogy to material\natoms. The supposed closeness between the views of Taurellus and\nGorlaeus thus rests on a misinterpretation of the ontology of the\nTriumph of Philosophy.\n\nIn critical responses to Vorstius, Taurellus has also been charged\nwith having been the author of the view that God is a limited\nquantitative being\u2014a view that his critics also ascribed to\nVorstius ([Anonymous] 1611: 8\u20139; Vorstius 1611: 22\u201323; see\nShriver 1970). As to the view that Vorstius\u2019s critics ascribed\nboth to Vorstius and to Taurellus (the view that God is a\nquantum that is limited and possesses accidents), it turns\nout, that such a reading does not adequately represent either\nVorstius\u2019s or Taurellus\u2019s views concerning divine\nextension. Vorstius holds that God is infinite not only with respect\nto duration and potency but also with respect to omnipresence\n(Vorstius 1610: 221). Because God is omnipresent, there is a\nquantitative aspect to his nature; however, Vorstius is clear that\n\n\n\nthis does not relate to physical or corporeal and sensible quantity\nbut has to be understood with respect to the true and by no means\nfictional but evidently for us imperceptible and spiritual magnitude\nof God. (Vorstius 1611: 2) \n\n\nAlso, Vorstius emphasizes that he \n\n\nnever claimed that God is finite unless perhaps in the sense that God\nis a definite being, that is, a determinate being on its own that is\ndistinct from other beings. (1611: 2\u20133) \n\n\nAccordingly, when Vorstius talks of the \u201cplace\u201d of God, he\ndoes not mean any physical place in the Aristotelian sense\u2014a\nplace defined by the boundaries of other bodies\u2014but rather\nwishes to express the view that God extends throughout the whole of\nspace (1611: 3).\n\nOn first sight, the views of Vorstius may seem to differ from\nTaurellus\u2019s conception of divine infinity, because\nTaurellus\u2019s conception seems to involve a sense in which God is\na material being. Consider the following passage: \n\n\nWe say that God is almighty both in the sense that he has an infinite\npotency due to his substance, and in the sense that he also has\ninfinite matter due to his essential characteristics, that is, one\nthat in no way hinders the agent through any potency of acting. (PT:\n484) \n\n\nHowever, although infinite matter, in a certain sense, seems to be\nincluded among the essential characteristics of God, Taurellus here\ngives an explication that clearly marks talk of \u201cinfinite\nmatter\u201d as metaphorical. \u201cInfinite matter\u201d as a\nmetaphor for the infinite divine potencies indicates that there are no\nfurther potencies that could function as an external impediment to\ndivine agency. Such a metaphorical usage of the notion of infinite\nmatter evidently does not imply that God has material (and, hence,\nlimited) properties.\n\nTaurellus thus cannot be understood as an atheist, an atomist, or a\nproponent of a theory of a material God. Nevertheless, the opposition\nthat Taurellus met during his lifetime was highly successful in\nraising suspicions in the minds of his contemporaries, and there are\nvirtually no references to his thought in subsequent publications by\nProtestant metaphysicians (on Taurellus\u2019s immediate successors,\nsee Sparn 1976). However, his work was by no means forgotten. It is\ndocumented that Jacob Thomasius (1622\u20131684), one of\nLeibniz\u2019s academic teachers, owned most of Taurellus\u2019s\nbooks (Schmid 1860: 19). Leibniz himself gave to Taurellus the epithet\nof \u201cthe Scaliger of the Germans\u201d (Feller 1718:\n142)\u2014no small compliment given the fact that the young Leibniz\nregarded Julius Caesar Scaliger as one of his models for an eclectic,\nconciliatory approach to philosophy (Leibniz 1923\u2013: II, 1, p.\n90).\n\nAlthough there are only some very few explicit references to Taurellus\nin Leibniz\u2019s writings, the nineteenth-century German philosopher\nLudwig Feuerbach (1804\u20131872) has suggested that the similarities\nbetween Taurellus and Leibniz may run much deeper than one would\nexpect. Feuerbach\u2019s suggestion is based on two considerations:\n(1) Taurellus\u2019s view of the active powers of the human mind\nbears similarities to Leibniz\u2019s conception of the inherently\nactive nature of human cognition; and (2) Taurellus\u2019s defense of\nsubstance pluralism and creation theory against Cesalpino bears\nsimilarities to Leibniz\u2019s defense of substance pluralism and\ncreation theory against Spinoza (Feuerbach 1981: 192\u2013193). If\none adds to Feuerbach\u2019s observations the similarities between\nTaurellus\u2019s conception of immaterial form-like unities as the\nultimate constituents of reality and Leibniz\u2019s conception of\nimmaterial, simple substances as grounding the physical world, then\nTaurellus may emerge as the thinker who, within the context of\nProtestant metaphysics, came closest to anticipating central elements\nof Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics.\n",
