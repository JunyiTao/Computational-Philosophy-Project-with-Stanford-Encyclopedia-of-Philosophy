    "main_text": "Scientific Method\n11.  Scientific Method\nGrosseteste\u2019s numerous short scientific works made no significant\ncontribution to scientific theory. Yet it has been argued that\nGrosseteste played a key role in the development of scientific\nmethod.  In particular, Crombie 1955 (a summary of Crombie\n1953) has claimed (1) that Grosseteste was the first in the Latin West\nto develop an account of an experimental method in science (98); (2)\nthat he \u201cseems to have been the first writer to make systematic\nuse of a method of experimental verification and falsification\u201d\n(107); (3) that he gave a \u201cspecial importance to mathematics in\nattempting to provide scientific explanations of the physical\nworld\u201d (111).  These claims have been the subject of\nconsiderable debate. \n The claim that Grosseteste developed an account of experimental\nmethod in science puts great weight on the aforementioned passage in\nwhich Grosseteste describes a controlled experiment to see whether\nscammony causes the discharge of red bile.  There can be little doubt\nthat Grosseteste does indeed have in mind the idea of a controlled\nexperiment. The question, however, is whether Grosseteste makes the\nnotion of controlled experiment part of a general account of a\nscientific method for arriving at the principles of demonstrative\nscience. The evidence that he does so is not strong. The discussion of\nscammony is the only reference to controlled experiment in his\nwritings, and when Grosseteste refers back to this discussion later in\nthe commentary as explaining how we come to acquire experiential\nprinciples, the notion of controlled experiment is sometimes\ninapplicable\u2014as for example, regarding our knowledge of\nthe cause of an eclipse. Moreover, Grosseteste is quite prepared to\ngrant that in some cases we can know causal connections after only a\nsingle perception (see Marrone 1986).  On balance, we may say that\nGrosseteste did employ the notion of controlled\nexperiment and related it to demonstrative science, but he hardly set\nit up as the method by which such knowledge is to be obtained; it is\none among many ways of arriving at such knowledge and is not accorded\nthe emphasis it has been given in scholarly commentary.\n As for Grosseteste\u2019s actual practice in his scientific writings,\nif by an experimental method is meant a method of controlled\nexperiment, then it must be said that Grosseteste makes no use of such\na method in these writings. He arrives at his conclusions in his\nscientific writings on the basis of a mix of considerations.  He\nappeals to authority and everyday observation (\u201cexperimentum\u201d\nin Latin) and makes use of thought experiments and certain\nmetaphysical assumptions, such as that \u201cevery operation of\nnature occurs in the most finite, ordered, shortest and best way\npossible for it\u201d (Baur 1912, 75). Nowhere does he describe a\ncontrolled experiment as the basis of his conclusions (see Eastwood\n1968, regarding Grosseteste\u2019s works in optics). We may grant that\nGrossetete does cite empirical observation as one factor among others\nwhen he assesses the adequacy of certain accounts of natural\nphenomena, but this is far from employing a method of experimental\nverification and falsification in the sense of a controlled\nexperiment.\n The claim that Grosseteste gave a \u201cspecial importance to\nmathematics in attempting to provide scientific explanations of the\nphysical world\u201d is on a stronger footing. In the opening of the\ntreatise On Lines, Angles and Figures Grosseteste remarks\nthat \u201cthe consideration of lines, angles and figures is of the\ngreatest utility since it is impossible for natural philosophy to be\nknown without them \u2026. All causes of natural effects have to be\ngiven through lines, angles and figures, for otherwise it is\nimpossible for the reason why (propter quid) to be known in\nthem\u201d (Baur 1912, 59\u201360).  In the treatise, On the Nature of\nPlaces, which is a continuation of On Lines, Angles and\nFigures, Grosseteste sums up the preceding text with the remark\nthat \u201cthe diligent investigator of natural phenomena can give\nthe causes of all natural effects, therefore, in this way by the rules\nand roots and foundations given from the power of geometry\u201d\n(Baur 1912, 65). Undoubtedly, then, Grosseteste saw a key role for\ngeometry in the explanation of natural phenomena. \n At the basis of this view was Grosseteste\u2019s view that natural\nagents act by the multiplication of their power or species, a view\nRoger Bacon was to develop in detail.  Grosseteste was, of course,\nthinking of the action of light. He holds that knowledge propter\nquid must be through angles, lines and figures because a\n\u201cnatural agent multiplies its power from itself to what it acts\nupon, whether it act upon the senses or upon matter\u201d (Baur 1912,\n60).  Grosseteste holds that the intensity of operation of the natural\nagent will be a matter of its distance from what it acts upon, the\nangle at which it strikes it, and the figure in which it multiplies\nits operation, this being either a sphere or cone. He establishes\ncertain rudimentary rules to this effect, such as that the shorter the\ndistance, the stronger the operation. \nThe remarks above should not blind us to the fact that Grosseteste\nwas deeply concerned with the detailed investigation of natural\nphenomena.  It was the inspiration of this attitude of mind, together\nwith Grosseteste\u2019s emphasis on the importance of mathematics, that was\nperhaps his chief legacy to thinkers in fourteenth-century Oxford who\nwere developing the beginnings of a mathematical physics.\n",
