    "main_text": "Prominent versions of pluralism || Platitude-based strategies\n3.1 Platitude-based strategies\n\n\nMany pluralists have followed Wright (1992) in supposing that\ncompliance with platitudes is what regiments and characterizes the\nbehavior and content of truth-predicates. Given a corollary account of\nhow differences in truth predicates relate to differences among truth\nproperties, this supposition suggests a platitude-based strategy for\npositing many ways of being true. Generally, a strategy will be\nplatitude-based if it is intended to show that a certain collection of\nplatitudes \\(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n\\) suffices for\nunderstanding the analysandum or explanandum. By\n\u2018platitude\u2019, philosophers generally mean certain\nuncontroversial expressions about a given topic or domain. Beyond that,\nconceptions about what more something must be or have to count as\nplatitudinous vary widely.\n3.1.1 Discourse pluralism/minimalism\n\n\nA well-known version of platitude-based pluralism is discourse\npluralism. The simplest versions of this view make the following four\nclaims. Firstly, discourse exhibits natural divisions, and so can be\nstably divided into different regions \\(D_1 , \\ldots ,D_n\\). Secondly, the platitudes subserving some\n\\(D_i\\) may be different than those subserving\n\\(D_j\\). Thirdly, for any pair \\((D_i,\nD_j)\\), compliance with different platitudes\nsubserving each region of discourse can, in principle, result in\nnumerically distinct truth predicates \\((t_i,\nt_j)\\). Finally, numerically distinct truth predicates\ndesignate different ways of being true.\n\n\nDiscourse pluralism is frequently associated with Crispin Wright\n(1992, 1996, 2001), although others have held similar views (see, e.g.,\nPutnam 1994: 515). Wright has argued that discourse pluralism is\nsupported by what he calls \u2018minimalism\u2019. According to\nminimalism, compliance with both the disquotational schema and the\noperator schema,\n\n(11) \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n(12) it is true that \\(p\\) if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nas well as other \u2018parent\u2019 platitudes, is both necessary\nand sufficient for some term \\(t_i\\) to qualify as\nexpressing a concept worth regarding as TRUTH (1992: 34\u20135).\nWright proposed that the parent platitudes, which basically serve as\nvery superficial formal or syntactic constraints, fall into two\nsubclasses: those connecting truth with assertion\n(\u2018transparency\u2019),\n\n(13) To assert is to present as true.\n\n(14) Any attitude to a proposition is an attitude towards its\ntruth.\n\n\nand those connecting truth with logical operations\n(\u2018embedding\u2019),\n\n(15) Any truth-apt content has a negation which is also\ntruth-apt.\n\n(16) Aptitude for truth is preserved under basic logical operations\n(disjunction, conjunction, etc.).\n\n\nAny such term complying with these parent platitudes, regardless of\nregion of discourse, counts as what Wright called a\n\u2018lightweight\u2019 or \u2018minimal\u2019 truth predicate.\nYet, the establishment of some \\(t\\) as a minimal truth predicate\nis compatible, argued Wright, with the nature of truth consisting in\ndifferent things in different domains (2001: 752).\n\n\nWright (2001) has also suggested that lightweight truth predicates\ntend to comply with five additional subclasses of platitudes, including\nthose connecting truth with reality (\u2018correspondence\u2019) and\neternity (\u2018stability\u2019),\n\n(17) For a sentence to be true is for it to correspond with\nreality.\n\n(18) True sentences accurately reflect how matters stand.\n(19) To be true is to \u201ctell it like it is\u201d.\n(20) A sentence is always true if it ever is.\n(21) Whatever may be asserted truly may be asserted truly at any\ntime.\n\n\nand those disconnecting truth from epistemic state\n(\u2018opacity\u2019), justification (\u2018contrast\u2019), and\nscalar degree (\u2018absoluteness\u2019),\n\n(22) A thinker may be so situated that a particular truth is beyond\nher ken.\n\n(23) Some truths may never be known.\n(24) Some truths may be unknowable in principle.\n(25) A sentence may be true without being justified and\nvice-versa.\n(26) Sentences cannot be more or less true.\n(27) Sentences are completely true if at all.\n\n\nThe idea is that \\(t\\) may satisfy additional platitudes beyond\nthese, and in doing so may increase its \u2018weight\u2019. For\nexample, some \\(t_i\\) may be a more heavyweight truth\npredicate than \\(t_j\\) in virtue of satisfying\nplatitudes which entail that truth be evidence-transcendent or that\nthere be mind-independent truth-makers. Finally, differences in what\nconstitutes truth in \\(D_1 , \\ldots ,D_n\\) are tracked by differences in the weight of\nthese predicates. In this way, Wright is able to accommodate the\nintuition that sentences about, e.g., macromolecules in biochemistry\nare amenable to realist truth in a way that sentences about\ndistributive welfare in ethics may not be.\n\n\nDistinctions among truth predicates, according to the discourse\npluralist, are due to more and less subtle differences among platitudes\nand principles with which they must comply. For example, assuming that\naccuracy of reflection is a matter of degree, predicates for truth and\ntruthlikeness diverge because a candidate predicate may comply with\neither (18) or else either of (26) or (27); to accommodate both, two\ncorollary platitudes must be included to make explicit that accurate\nreflection in the case of truth is necessarily maximal and that degrees\nof accuracy are not equivalent to degrees of truth. Indeed, it is not\nunusual for platitudes to presuppose certain attendant semantic or\nmetaphysical views. For example,\n\n(28) A sentence may be characterized as true just in case it\nexpresses a true proposition.\n\n\n\nrequires anti-nominalist commitments, an ontological commitment to\npropositions, and commitments to the expression relation (translation\nrelations, an account of synonymy, etc.). Discourse pluralists\nrequiring predicates to comply with (28) in order to count as\ntruth-predicates must therefore be prepared to accommodate other claims\nthat go along with (28) as a package-deal.\n3.1.2 Functionalism about truth\n\n\u2018Functionalism about truth\u2019 names the thesis that truth\nis a functional kind. The most comprehensive and systematic development\nof a platitude-based version of functionalism comes from Michael Lynch,\nwho has been at the forefront of ushering in pluralist themes and\ntheses (see Lynch 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004c, 2005a, 2005b, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2013; Devlin\n2003). Lynch has urged that we need to think about truth in terms of\nthe \u2018job\u2019 or role, \\(F\\), that true sentences stake\nout in our discursive practices (2005a: 29).\n\n\nInitially, Lynch\u2019s brand of functionalism attempted to\nimplicitly define the denotation of \u2018truth\u2019 using the\nquasi-formal technique of Ramsification. The technique commences by\ntreating \u2018true\u2019 as the theoretical term \\(\\tau\\)\nissued by the theory \\(T\\) and targeted for implicit definition.\nFirstly, the platitudes and principles of the theory are amassed\n\\((T: p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) so that\nthe \\(F\\)-role can be specified holistically. Secondly, a certain\nsubset \\(A\\) of essential platitudes \\((p_i ,\n\\ldots ,p_k)\\) must be extracted from \\(T\\),\nand are then conjoined. Thirdly, following David Lewis, \\(T\\) is\nrewritten as\n\n(29) \\(R(\\tau_1,\\ldots ,\n\\tau_n , \\omicron_1,\\ldots , \\omicron_n )\\)\n\n\n\nso as to isolate the \\(\\tau\\)-terms from the non-theoretical\n(\u2018old, original, other\u2019) \\(o\\)-terms. Fourthly, all\ninstances of \u2018true\u2019 and other cognate or closely related\n\\(\\tau\\)-terms are then replaced by subscripted variables\n\\(x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\). The resulting\nopen sentence is prefixed with existential quantifiers to bind them.\nNext, the Ramsey sentence is embedded in a material biconditional; this\nallows functionalists to then specify the conditions by which a given\ntruth-apt sentence \\(p\\) has a property that plays the \\(F\\)-role:\n\n(30) \\(p\\) has some property \\(\\varrho_i\\) realizing the\n\\(F\\)-role \\(\\equiv \\exists x_1 , \\ldots ,\\exists x_n [R(x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n , \\omicron_1,\\ldots , \\omicron_n ) \\amp p\\) has\n\\(x_1\\)],\n\n\n\nwhere, say, the variable \\(x_1\\) is the one that\nreplaced \u2018true\u2019. Having specified the conditions under\nwhich \\(p\\) has some property realizing \\(F\\), functionalists can then\nderive another material biconditional stating that \\(p\\) is true iff \\(p\\) has\nsome property realizing the \\(F\\)-role.\n\n\nHowever, as Lynch (2004: 394) cautioned, biconditionals that specify\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for \\(p\\) to be true still leave open\nquestions about the \u2018deep\u2019 metaphysical nature of truth.\nThus, given the choice, Lynch\u2014following up on a suggestion from\nPettit (1996: 886)\u2014urged functionalists to identify truth, not\nwith the properties realizing the \\(F\\)-role in a given region of\ndiscourse, but with the \\(F\\)-role itself. Doing so is one way to\ntry to secure the \u2018unity\u2019 of truth (on the presumption that\nthere is just one \\(F\\)-role). Hence, to say that truth is a\nfunctional kind \\(F\\) is to say that the \\(\\tau\\)-term\n\u2018truth\u2019 denotes the property of having a property that\nplays the \\(F\\)-role, where the \\(F\\)-role is tantamount to\nthe single unique second-order property of being \\(F\\).\nAccordingly, this theory proposes that something is true just in case\nit is \\(F\\).\n\n\nTwo consequences are apparent. Firstly, the functionalist\u2019s\ncommitment to alethic properties realizing the \\(F\\)-role seems to\nbe a commitment to a grounding thesis. This explains why Lynch\u2019s\nversion of alethic functionalism fits the pattern typical of\ninflationary theories of truth, which are committed to (6) and\n(7) above. Secondly, however, like most traditional inflationary\ntheories, Lynch\u2019s functionalism about truth appears to be\nmonistic. Indeed, the functionalist commitment to identifying truth\nwith and only with the unique property of being \\(F\\) seems to\nentail a commitment to strong alethic monism in (5) rather than\npluralism (Wright 2005). Nonetheless, it is clear that Lynch\u2019s\nversion does emphasize that sentences can have the property of being\n\\(F\\) in different ways. The theory thus does a great deal to\naccommodate the intuitions that initially motivate the pluralist thesis\nthat there is more than one way of being true, and to finesse a fine\nline between monism and pluralism.\n\n\nFor pluralists, this compromise may not be good enough, and critics\nof functionalism about truth have raised several concerns. One\nstumbling block for functionalist theories is a worry about epistemic\ncircularity. As Wright (2010) observes, any technique for implicit\ndefinition, such as Ramsification, proceeds on the basis of explicit\ndecisions that the platitudes and principles constitutive of the\nmodified Ramsey sentence are themselves true, and making explicit\ndecisions that they are true requires already knowing in advance what\ntruth is. Lynch (2013a) notes that the problem is not peculiar to\nfunctionalism about truth, generalizing to virtually all approaches\nthat attempt to fix the denotation of \u2018true\u2019 by appeal to\nimplicit definition. Some might want to claim that it generalizes even\nfurther, namely to any theory of truth whatsoever. Another issue is\nthat the \\(F\\)-role becomes disunified to the extent that\n\\(T\\) can accommodate substantially different platitudes and\nprinciples. Recall that the individuation and identity conditions of\nthe \\(F\\)-role\u2014with which truth is identified\u2014are\ndetermined holistically by the platitudes and principles constituting\n\\(T\\). So where \\(T\\) is constituted by expressions of the\nbeliefs and commitments of ordinary folk, pluralists could try to show\nthat these beliefs and commitments significantly differ across\nepistemic communities (see, e.g., N\u00e6ss 1938a, b; Maffie 2002;\nUlatowski 2017, Wyatt 2018). In that case, Ramsification over\nsignificantly different principles may yield implicit definitions of\nnumerically distinct role properties\n\\(F_1, F_2 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), each of which is a warranted claimant to being\ntruth.\n",
