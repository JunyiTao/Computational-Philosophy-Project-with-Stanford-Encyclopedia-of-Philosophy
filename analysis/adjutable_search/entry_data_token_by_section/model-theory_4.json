In a closely related sense, you\nmodel a system or structure that you plan to build, by\nwriting a description of it. These are very different senses of\n\u2018model\u2019 from that in model theory: the \u2018model\u2019\nof the phenomenon or the system is not a structure but a theory, often\nin a formal language. The Unified Modeling Language, UML\nfor short, is a formal language designed for just this purpose.\nIt\u2019s reported that the Australian Navy once hired a model\ntheorist for a job \u2018modelling hydrodynamic phenomena\u2019.\n(Please don\u2019t enlighten them!) \n\nA little history will show how the word \u2018model\u2019 came to\nhave these two different uses. In late Latin a \u2018modellus\u2019\nwas a measuring device, for example to measure water or milk. By the\nvagaries of language, the word generated three different words in\nEnglish: mould, module, model. Often a device that measures out a\nquantity of a substance also imposes a form on the substance. We see\nthis with a cheese mould, and also with the metal letters (called\n\u2018moduli\u2019 in the early 17th century) that carry ink to\npaper in printing. So \u2018model\u2019 comes to mean an object in\nhand that expresses the design of some other objects in the world: the\nartist\u2019s model carries the form that the artist depicts, and\nChristopher Wren\u2019s \u2018module\u2019 of St Paul\u2019s\nCathedral serves to guide the builders.\n\nAlready by the late 17th century the word \u2018model\u2019 could\nmean an object that shows the form, not of real-world objects, but of\nmathematical constructs. Leibniz boasted that he didn\u2019t need\nmodels in order to do mathematics. Other mathematicians were happy to\nuse plaster or metal models of interesting surfaces. The models of\nmodel theory first appeared as abstract versions of this kind of\nmodel, with theories in place of the defining equation of a surface.\nOn the other hand one could stay with real-world objects but show\ntheir form through a theory rather than a physical copy in hand;\n\u2018modelling\u2019 is building such a theory.\n\nWe have a confusing halfway situation when a scientist describes a\nphenomenon in the world by an equation, for example a differential\nequation with exponential functions as solutions. Is the model the\ntheory consisting of the equation, or are these exponential functions\nthemselves models of the phenomenon? Examples of this kind, where\ntheory and structures give essentially the same information, provide\nsome support for Patrick Suppes\u2019 claim that \u201cthe meaning\nof the concept of model is the same in mathematics and the empirical\nsciences\u201d (1969, 12). Several\nphilosophers of science have pursued the idea of using an informal\nversion of model-theoretic models for scientific modelling. Sometimes\nthe models are described as non-linguistic \u2013 this might be hard\nto reconcile with our definition of models in section 1 above.\n\nCognitive science is one area where the difference between models and\nmodelling tends to become blurred. A central question of cognitive\nscience is how we represent facts or possibilities in our minds. If\none formalises these mental representations, they become something\nlike \u2018models of phenomena\u2019. But it is a serious hypothesis\nthat in fact our mental representations have a good deal in common\nwith simple set-theoretic structures, so that they are\n\u2018models\u2019 in the model-theoretic sense too. In 1983 two\ninfluential works of cognitive science were published, both under the\ntitle Mental Models. The first, edited by Dedre Gentner and\nAlbert Stevens, was about people\u2019s\n\u2018conceptualizations\u2019 of the elementary facts of physics;\nit belongs squarely in the world of \u2018modelling of\nphenomena\u2019. The second, by Philip Johnson-Laird, is largely\nabout reasoning, and makes several appeals to \u2018model-theoretic\nsemantics\u2019 in our sense. Researchers in the Johnson-Laird\ntradition tend to refer to their approach as \u2018model\ntheory\u2019, and to see it as allied in some sense to what we have\ncalled model theory.\n\nPictures and diagrams seem at first to hover in the middle ground\nbetween theories and models. In practice model theorists often draw\nthemselves pictures of structures, and use the pictures to think about\nthe structures. On the other hand pictures don\u2019t generally carry\nthe labelling that is an essential feature of model-theoretic\nstructures. There is a fast growing body of work on reasoning with\ndiagrams, and the overwhelming tendency of this work is to see\npictures and diagrams as a form of language rather than as a form of\nstructure. For example Eric Hammer and Norman Danner (1996) describe a\n\u2018model theory of Venn diagrams\u2019; the Venn diagrams\nthemselves are the syntax, and the model theory is a set-theoretical\nexplanation of their meaning.  (A curious counterexample is the\nhorizontal line diagrams of the 12th century Baghdad Jewish scholar\nAb\u016b l-Barak\u0101t they represent structures and not\npropositions, and Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t uses them to express\nmodel-theoretic consequence in syllogisms.  Further details are in\nHodges 2018 on model-theoretic consequence.)\n\nThe model theorist Yuri Gurevich introduced abstract state\nmachines (ASMs) as a way of using model-theoretic ideas for\nspecification in computer science. According to the Abstract State\nMachine website (see Other Internet Resources below),\n\nany algorithm can be modeled at its natural abstraction level by an\nappropriate ASM. \u2026 ASMs use classical mathematical structures\nto describe states of a computation; structures are well-understood,\nprecise models.\n\n\nThe book of B\u00f6rger and St\u00e4rk cited below is an authoritative\naccount of ASMs and their uses. \n\nToday you can make your name and fortune by finding a good\nrepresentation system. There is no reason to expect that every such\nsystem will fit neatly into the syntax/semantics framework of model\ntheory, but it will be surprising if model-theoretic ideas don\u2019t\ncontinue to make a major contribution in this area.",
