    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Essence and Being\n5.3 Predication of Being\n\nFinally, in question 27 of his commentary on the Categories,\nSimon straightforwardly opts for the analogy of the predication of\nbeing across the ten Aristotelian categories. Being is not univocally\npredicated as the genus of the categories because it is not univocally\npredicated of substance and accident. In fact, accidents do not have\nbeing without qualification because they only have quiddity in\nrelation to substances, and so their being depends on the being of\nsubstances. But being is not purely equivocal with respect to\nsubstance and accident either, because accidents have being in a\ncertain respect thanks to their relation to substances. Being, then,\nis analogous to substance and accident: it is primarily predicated of\nsubstances and secondarily predicated of accidents. \n",
