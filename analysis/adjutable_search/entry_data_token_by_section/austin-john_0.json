    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nJohn Austin\u2019s life (1790\u20131859) was filled with\ndisappointment and unfulfilled expectations. His influential friends\n(who included Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, John Stuart Mill and Thomas\nCarlyle) were impressed by his intellect and his conversation, and\npredicted he would go far. However, in public dealings, Austin\u2019s\nnervous disposition, shaky health, tendency towards melancholy, and\nperfectionism combined to end quickly careers at the Bar, in academia,\nand in government service (Hamburger 1985, 1992).\n\nAustin was born to a Suffolk merchant family, and served briefly in\nthe military before beginning his legal training. He was called to the\nBar in 1818, but he took on few cases, and quit the practice of law in\n1825. Austin shortly thereafter obtained an appointment to the first\nChair of Jurisprudence at the recently established University of\nLondon. He prepared for his lectures by study in Bonn, and evidence of\nthe influence of continental legal and political ideas can be found\nscattered throughout Austin\u2019s writings. Commentators have found\nevidence in Austin\u2019s writings of the German Pandectist treatment\nof Roman Law, in particular, its approach to law as something that is,\nor should be, systematic and coherent (Schwarz 1934; Stein 1988: pp.\n223\u2013229, 238\u2013244; Lobban 1991: pp. 223\u2013256, Lobban\n2013).\n\nLectures from the course he gave were eventually published in 1832 as\n\u201cProvince of Jurisprudence Determined\u201d (Austin 1832).\nHowever, attendance at his courses was small and getting smaller, and\nhe gave his last lecture in 1833. A short-lived effort to give a\nsimilar course of lectures at the Inner Temple met the same result.\nAustin resigned his University of London Chair in 1835. He later\nbriefly served on the Criminal Law Commission, and as a Royal\nCommissioner to Malta, but he never found either success or\ncontentment. He did some occasional writing on political themes, but\nhis plans for longer works never came to anything during his lifetime,\ndue apparently to some combination of perfectionism, melancholy, and\nwriter\u2019s block. His changing views on moral, political, and\nlegal matters also apparently hindered both the publication of a\nrevised edition of \u201cProvince of Jurisprudence Determined,\u201d\nand the completion of a longer project started when his views had been\ndifferent.\n\n(Some scholars have argued that Austin may have moved away from\nanalytical jurisprudence (see below) towards something more\napproximating the historical jurisprudence school; cf. Hamburger 1985:\npp. 178\u201391, arguing for Austin\u2019s views having changed\nsignificantly, with Rumble 2013, arguing against that view.)\n\nMuch of whatever success Austin found during his life, and after, must\nbe attributed to his wife Sarah, for her tireless support, both moral\nand economic (during the later years of their marriage, they lived\nprimarily off her efforts as a translator and reviewer), and her work\nto publicize his writings after his death (including the publication\nof a more complete set of his Lectures on Jurisprudence) (Austin\n1879). Credit should also be given to Austin\u2019s influential\nfriends, who not only helped him to secure many of the positions he\nheld during his lifetime, but also gave important support for his\nwritings after his death (Hamburger 1985: pp. 33, 197; Morison 1982:\np. 17; Mill 1863).\n\nAustin\u2019s work was influential in the decades after his passing\naway (Rumble 2005); this influence was in part due to the restatement\nof is ideas by other thinkers, like T. E. Holland (Postema 2011: p.\n4). E. C. Clark wrote in the late 19th century that Austin\u2019s\nwork \u201cis undoubtedly forming a school of English jurists,\npossibly of English legislators also. It is the staple of\njurisprudence in all our systems of legal education\u201d (Clark\n1883: pp. 4\u20135). A similar assessment is made by H.L.A. Hart,\nlooking back nearly a century later: \u201cwithin a few years of his\ndeath it was clear that his work had established the study of\njurisprudence in England\u201d (Hart 1955: p. xvi). As will be\ndiscussed, Austin\u2019s influence can be seen at a number of levels,\nincluding the general level of how legal theory, and law generally,\nwere taught (Stein 1988: pp. 238\u2013244), and the use of an\nanalytical approach in legal theory. At such levels, Austin\u2019s\nimpact is felt to this day. Hart could write that\n\u201cAustin\u2019s influence on the development of England of\n[Jurisprudence] has been greater than that of any other writer,\u201d\n(Hart 1955: p. xvi) even while Austin\u2019s particular command\ntheory of law became almost friendless, and is today probably best\nknown from Hart\u2019s use of it (1958: 602\u2013606, 2012:\n18\u201325) as a foil for the elaboration of Hart\u2019s own, more\nnuanced approach to legal theory. In recent decades, some theorists\nhave revisited Austin\u2019s command theory (and other works),\noffering new characterizations and defenses of his ideas (e.g.,\nMorison 1982, Rumble 1985, see generally Freeman & Mindus\n2013).\n",
