    "main_text": "Range of Meanings and Uses || Negative retributivism\n3.3 Negative retributivism\n\nWhat has been called \u201cnegative\u201d (Mackie 1982),\n\u201cminimalist\u201d (Golding 1975), or \u201cweak\u201d (Hart\n1968: ch. 1) retributivism is the view that only something similar to\nthe negative component of retributivism is true. It is the view that\nwrongdoers forfeit their right not to suffer proportional punishment,\nbut that the positive reasons for punishment must appeal to some other\ngoods that punishment achieves, such as deterrence or incapacitation.\nWrongdoing, on this view, is merely a necessary condition for\npunishment. The desert of the wrongdoer provides neither a sufficient\ncondition for nor even a positive reason to punish (see also Mabbott\n1939; Quinton 1954).\n\nOf these three labels, negative retributivism seems the most apt, as\nit picks up the idea that wrongdoing negates the right the\nwrongdoer otherwise would have not to be punished. The alternative\nlabels also risk confusing negative retributivism with the thought\nthat the reasons to punish given by positive retributivism can be\nquite weak. Differences along that dimension should not be confused\nwith a position that denies that guilt, by itself, provides any reason\nto punish.\n\nNegative retributivism is often confusingly framed as the view that it\nis impermissible to punish a wrongdoer more than she deserves. (Hart\n1968: 236\u2013237; Duff 2001: 12; Lippke 2015: 58.) If desert\nprovides a limit to punishment, then it must be deserved up to that\nlimit. But there is a reason to give people what they deserve. Yet\nnegative retributivism is offered as the view that desert provides no\nreason to punish. This contradiction can be avoided by reading the\nnegative limit in terms of proportional forfeiture without referring\nto desert.\n\nThe line between negative retributivism and retributivism that posits\na weak positive reason to punish may seem unimportant. A negative\nretributivist holds that the justification for punishment must come\ncompletely from its instrumental value. A positive retributivist who\nthinks that the reasons provided by desert are relatively weak may say\nthat most of what justifies punishment comes from the same\ninstrumental bases. For both, a full justification of punishment will\nbe \u201cmixed\u201d, appealing to both retributive and\nconsequentialist ideas (Garvey 2004: 449\u2013451).\n\nNonetheless, there are three reasons it is important to distinguish\nthe two, and taken together they speak in favor of positive\nretributivism. First, negative retributivism seems to justify using\npeople merely as a means (within retributive limits) for promoting the\ngreater good (Duff 2001: 13). The thought that punishment treats\nwrongdoers as they deserve to be treated addresses this problem.\n\nSecond, a positive retributivist can distinguish different parts of\nthe all-things-considered justification for punishment. She can say,\nas Moore does (1997: 87), that the justification for\npunishing another, the thing that makes an act punitive rather than\nmerely an act of using or incapacitating another, is that the person\ndeserves to be punished for a wrong done. She can also take note of\nthe fact that punishment has its costs (see\n section 4.5),\n and she can cite the consequentialist benefits of punishment to\noutweigh those costs. Still, she can conceive of the significance of\nthese consequentialist benefits as merely offsetting the\nconsequentialist costs, not as providing a justification for the act\nqua punishment. This is not an option for negative retributivists.\n\nThird, it is not clear whether forfeiture theories that do not appeal\nto desert can make sense of the proportionality restrictions that are\ncentral to retributivism (Duff 2001: 14\u201316). Indeed, the\nproportionality limits of a pure forfeiture model, without desert, may\nbe quite different from the limits implicit in the notion of deserved\npunishment. A pure forfeiture model arguably would limit hard\ntreatment only to ensure that penalties strike a fair balance between\nthe claims of individuals not to have to bear them and the claims of\nthe state to take effective measures to promote important public ends.\nAll the concerns with the gravity of the wrong seem to go missing\n(Walen forthcoming). To cite the gravity of the wrong to set\nproportionality limits seems to presuppose some fundamental connection\nbetween the gravity of the wrong and proportional punishment (see\n section 4.4).\n That connection is naturally picked up with the notion of deserved\npunishment. If one eschews that notion, it is not clear how to make\nthe connection.\n",
