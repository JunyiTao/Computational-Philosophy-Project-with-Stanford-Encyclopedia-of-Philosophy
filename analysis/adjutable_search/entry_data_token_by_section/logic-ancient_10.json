These arguments were inspired by Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogisms \u2018from a hypothesis\u2019 (An. Pr. 1.44);\nthey were forerunners of modus ponens and modus\ntollens and had the following forms (Theophrastus frs. 111 and\n112 Fortenbaugh), employing the exclusive \u2018or\u2019:\n\n\n\n If something is F, it is G.\na is F.\n Therefore, a is G.\n \n\n If something is F, it is G.\na is not G.\n Therefore, a is not F.\n \n\n\n\n Either something is F or it is G.\na is F.\n Therefore, a is not G.\n \n\n Either something is F or it is G.\na is not F.\n Therefore, a is G.\n \n\n\n\n\nTheophrastus also recognized that the connective particle\n\u2018or\u2019 can be inclusive (Theophrastus fr. 82A Fortenbaugh);\nand he considered relative quantified sentences such as those\ncontaining \u2018more\u2019, \u2018fewer\u2019, and \u2018the\nsame\u2019 (Theophrastus fr. 89 Fortenbaugh), and seems to have\ndiscussed syllogisms built from such sentences, again following up\nupon what Aristotle said about syllogisms from a hypothesis\n(Theophrastus fr. 111E Fortenbaugh).\n",
