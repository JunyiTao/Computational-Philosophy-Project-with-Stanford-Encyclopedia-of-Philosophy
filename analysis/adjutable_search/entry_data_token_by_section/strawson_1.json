    "main_text": "Reference\n2. Reference\n\nStrawson published \u2018On Referring\u2019 in 1950. (Like Frege,\nRussell and, later, Kripke and Evans, Strawson made his name by\nwriting about reference.) He subsequently modified and developed his\nviews on reference, but the central claim of \u2018On\nReferring\u2019 is something he always defended. Strawson\u2019s\ntitle contains, of course, an allusion to Russell\u2019s famous\narticle \u2018On Denoting\u2019, the central idea of which Strawson\nis criticising. Strawson\u2019s conception of the debate is that\nRussell offered his theory of descriptions as a complete account of\nthe role of definite descriptions in English (such expressions as\n\u2018the queen of England\u2019), whereas the truth is that the\nrole of the word \u2018the\u2019 when embedded in definite\ndescriptions cannot be captured in a single account. There are uses\nwhich do not fit Russell\u2019s theory because the phenomenon is\nsimply more complex than Russell allowed. It is not, therefore, that\nStrawson is offering his own complete theory; it is, rather, that he\nis picking out uses for which, according to him, Russell\u2019s\ntheory fails, and characterising them. Russell\u2019s theory had\nachieved the status of orthodoxy at the time that Strawson launched\nhis attack on it. That this is the way to understand Strawson\u2019s\ncontribution to the debate has the important consequence that it is no\nobjection to his approach to point to uses of \u2018the\u2019 about\nwhich, arguably, Russell (or something close to Russell\u2019s view)\nmight be correct. Such points do not touch Strawson\u2019s central\nclaim. This undermines a number of responses to Strawson.\nStrawson\u2019s paper initiated a debate about definite descriptions\nthat has run ever since its publication, and in which his views have\nremained central.\n\nRussell claimed that a sentence of the form \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 says; \u2018There is one and only one F\nand it is G.\u2019 The difference from \u2018An F\nis G\u2019 is that the latter merely claims that there is\na (G) F, whereas the use of the definite\narticle imports the extra claim of uniqueness. Both are alike in\nmaking an existential claim about Fs, namely, there is an\nF, and hence, according to Russell, at least part of the role\nof \u2018the\u2019 is to be (or to introduce) what is called an\nexistential quantifier. This, in a crude presentation, is\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Definite Descriptions. Against this Strawson\nargued, first, that it is unsupported. He claimed that Russell\u2019s\nmain support for his theory is that a sentence such as \u2018The king\nof France is bald\u2019 remains meaningful even though there is no\nking of France. Its having meaning cannot, therefore, depend on there\nbeing a referent for the apparent subject expression. According to\nStrawson, Russell infers from that to the conclusion that the semantic\nrole of the apparent subject expression in such sentences (i.e.\n\u2018the F\u2019) cannot be to refer to or designate an\nobject, and must, rather, function as a quantifier. Against this,\nStrawson suggested that the meaningfulness of \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 should be thought of as, roughly, there being rules\nas to what a use of the sentence in different circumstances will\namount to. If the circumstances are right, then it can be used in a\nreferring way; if not, then the use might not succeed in being an act\nof reference. Strawson\u2019s distinction between a sentence\u2019s\nhaving a meaning and the speech act performed by its use on an\noccasion is clearly sound and important. One question that was debated\nis whether all of Russell\u2019s reasons for his theory are disarmed\nby the introduction of this distinction.\n\nHowever, against the Russellian theory itself Strawson made the\nimportant point that the theory implies that a sentence of the form\n\u2018The F is G\u2019 must count as false when\nused in circumstances where there is no F. (These cases are\noften described as ones involving \u2018reference failure\u2019). It\nmust do so because, according to the theory, part of the role of\n\u2018The F\u2019 (at least in such declarative sentences)\nis to say that there is an F. Contrary to this, Strawson\nclaims that we would not always regard a saying of \u2018The\nF is G\u2019 as false in such circumstances. We\nwould not react by saying \u2018That is false\u2019 but would rather\nsay something like \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 or \u2018You must\nbe under a misapprehension\u2019. He suggests that in such\ncircumstances the use amounts neither to saying something true nor to\nsaying something false. It exhibits what came to be called a\n\u2018truth-value gap\u2019. In subsequent discussion it became\nclear that it is difficult to determine what we should say about the\ntruth value of sentences involving referential failure.\nStrawson\u2019s main objection to Russell\u2019s account is, though,\nthat it is simply obvious that sometimes we use \u2018The\nF\u2019 to refer to or pick out an object, and we do not\nthen use it to say that there is an F.\n\nStrawson\u2019s attitude is well presented in a later important paper\nwhere he says:\n\nThe distinction between identifying reference and uniquely existential\nassertion is something quite undeniable. The sense in which the\nexistence of something answering to a definite description used for\nthe purpose of identifying reference, and its distinguishability by an\naudience from anything else, is presupposed and not asserted in an\nutterance containing such an expression, so used, stands absolutely\nfirm, whether or not one opts for the view that radical failure of the\npresupposition would deprive the statement of a truth-value. It\nremains a decisive objection to the theory of Descriptions \u2026\nthat \u2026 it amounts to a denial of these undeniable distinctions.\n(Strawson 1964, 85)\n\n\nThis passage reveals four important aspects of Strawson\u2019s\napproach to definite descriptions.\n\nThe first is that his fundamental objection to Russell is that it is\nsimply obvious to him as a sensitive and self-reflective user of\nlanguage that the use of the word \u2018the\u2019 does not conform\nto the theory. Whatever puzzles there may be about language and\nreference their solution cannot require us to deny such obvious facts.\nIt is a recurring theme in, or perhaps a recurring part of the method\nof, Strawson\u2019s philosophical discussion of language that some\naspects of language are more or less obvious to us. Second, the\ncontrast that strikes Strawson as especially obvious is that between\nsaying that there is (one and only one) F and\nemploying, in certain contexts, the definite description \u2018The\nF\u2019. If, standing in front of our familiar car, I say to\nmy family, \u2018The car will not start\u2019, I am hardly telling\nthem that we have, or there is, a certain car. Why should I engage in\na communicative act of that sort? It is the importance of this\ncontrast that impressed Strawson, as opposed to the problem often now\nraised against Russell\u2019s theory, that the uniqueness commitment\nseems equally problematic. Strawson notes the issue about uniqueness\nbut attends most to the assertion of existence problem. This reading\nof the nature of Strawson\u2019s main objection to Russell implies\nthat a crucial question is whether it is indeed an implication of\nRussell\u2019s analysis that the person employing the description\n\u2018The F\u2019 (in normal discourse) says that\nthere is one (and only one) F. If that is not an implication\nof Russell\u2019s analysis then Strawson\u2019s main objection\nlapses. It might also be asked whether any analysis of descriptions in\nterms of quantifiers, even if developed in a more sophisticated way,\nmust have such a problematic implication.\n\nThird, one central concept in Strawson\u2019s developed description\nof the role of such an expression as \u2018The F\u2019 is\nthat it can be a device for what he calls identifying reference.\nRoughly, Strawson\u2019s idea is that the definite description is\nsometimes chosen to enable the audience to fix on or pick out as the\nsubject matter of the claim an item of which they already know. In\nthis role it cannot be that \u2018the F\u2019 tells them of\nthe existence of such an F, since its role rests on the prior\nexistence of such knowledge. Strawson provides a detailed analysis of\nthis function in the first chapter of Individuals, as well as\nin the article from which the above quotation comes. Finally, a notion\nthat Strawson introduced in his own description of the nature of\ndefinite descriptions and which surfaces in the quotation is that of\npresupposition. Strawson said that the use of a definite\ndescription standardly presupposes the existence of an object fitting\nthe description even though it does not say, nor therefore entail,\nthat there is such an object. This concept met with resistance amongst\nphilosophers but has had a colossal influence on linguists, who have\ntended to see it as a useful concept in the description of language\n(see Huang 2007, ch. 7). This encourages us to ask whether it is more\nlikely that linguists or philosophers have the better insight into\nlanguage.\n",
