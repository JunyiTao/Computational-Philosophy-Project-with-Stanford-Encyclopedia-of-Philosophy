    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Action || Action and Speech as Disclosure\n4.2 Action and Speech as Disclosure\n\n\nLet us now turn to an examination of the disclosing power of action\nand speech. In the opening section of the chapter on action in The\nHuman Condition Arendt discusses one of its central functions,\nnamely, the disclosure of the identity of the agent. In action and\nspeech, she maintains, individuals reveal themselves as the unique\nindividuals they are, disclose to the world their distinct\npersonalities. In terms of Arendt\u2019s distinction, they reveal\n\u201cwho\u201d they are as distinct to \u201cwhat\u201d they are\n\u2014 the latter referring to individual abilities and talents, as well as\ndeficiencies and shortcomings, which are traits all human beings\nshare.  Neither labor nor work enable individuals to disclose their\nidentities, to reveal \u201cwho\u201d they are as distinct from\n\u201cwhat\u201d they are. In labor the individuality of each person\nis submerged by being bound to a chain of natural necessities, to the\nconstraints imposed by biological survival. When we engage in labor we\ncan only show our sameness, the fact that we all belong to the human\nspecies and must attend to the needs of our bodies. In this sphere we\ndo indeed \u201cbehave,\u201d \u201cperform roles,\u201d and\n\u201cfulfill functions,\u201d since we all obey the same\nimperatives. In work there is more scope for individuality, in that\neach work of art or production bears the mark of its maker; but the\nmaker is still subordinate to the end product, both in the sense of\nbeing guided by a model, and in the sense that the product will\ngenerally outlast the maker. Moreover, the end product reveals little\nabout the maker except the fact that he or she was able to make it. It\ndoes not tell us who the creator was, only that he or she had certain\nabilities and talents. It is thus only in action and speech, in\ninteracting with others through words and deeds, that individuals\nreveal who they personally are and can affirm their unique identities.\nAction and speech are in this sense very closely related because both\ncontain the answer to the question asked of every newcomer: \u201cWho\nare you?\u201d This disclosure of the \u201cwho\u201d is made\npossible by both deeds and words, but of the two it is speech that has\nthe closest affinity to revelation. Without the accompaniment of\nspeech, action would lose its revelatory quality and could no longer\nbe identified with an agent. It would lack, as it were, the conditions\nof ascription of agency.\n",
