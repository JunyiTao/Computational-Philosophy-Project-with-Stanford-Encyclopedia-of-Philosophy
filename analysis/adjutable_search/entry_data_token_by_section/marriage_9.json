    "main_text": "The Politics of Marriage || Arguments for Marriage Reform\n4.4 Arguments for Marriage Reform\n\nA number of theorists have argued for the abolition or restructuring\nof marriage. While same-sex marriage became legally recognized\nthroughout the United States following the Supreme Court decision in\nObergefell v Hodges 576 U.S. _ (2015), some philosophers\ncontend that justice requires further reform. Some have proposed that\ntemporary marriage contracts be made available (Nolan 2016, Shrage\n2013) and that legal frameworks for marriage and parenting be\nseparated (Brennan and Cameron 2016, Shrage 2018). A more sweeping\nview, to be discussed in Section 5, is that marriage is in itself\noppressive and unjust, and hence ought to be abolished (Card 1996,\nFineman 2004, Chambers 2013, 2017). A second argument for\ndisestablishing or privatizing legal marriage holds that, in the\nabsence of a pressing rationale for marriage law (as discussed in\n4.2), the religious or ethical associations of marriage law give\nreason for abolishing marriage as a legal category. Marriage has\nreligious associations in part responsible for public controversy over\nsame-sex marriage. If marriage is essentially defined by a\nreligious or ethical view of the good, then legal recognition of it\narguably violates state neutrality or even religious freedom (Metz\n2010, but see Macedo 2015, May 2016, Wedgwood 2016).\n\nThere are several reform proposals compatible with the\n\u2018disestablishment\u2019 of marriage. One proposal is full\ncontractualization or privatization, leaving marriage to churches and\nprivate organizations. \u201cMarital contractualism\u201d (MC) would\nrelegate spousal agreements to existing contract law, eradicating any\nspecial legal marital status or rights. Garrett has defended MC as the\ndefault position, arguing that state regulation of contracts between\nspouses and state expenditures on marriage administration and\npromotion need justification. On his view, efficiency, equality,\ndiversity, and informed consent favor MC; there is no adequate\njustification for the costly redistribution of taxpayer funds to the\nmarried, or for sustaining social stigma against the unmarried through\nlegal marriage (Garrett 2009, see also Chartier 2016).\n\nBut marriage confers rights not available through private contract and\nwhich arguably should not be eliminated due to their importance in\nprotecting intimate relationships\u2014such as evidentiary privilege\nor special eligibility for immigration. A second proposal would retain\nsuch rights while abolishing marriage; on this proposal, the state\nought to replace civil marriage entirely with a secular status such as\ncivil union or domestic partnership, which could serve the purpose of\nidentifying significant others for benefit entitlements, visiting\nrights, and so on (March 2010, 2011). This would allow equal treatment\nof same-sex relationships while reducing controversy, avoiding\nnon-neutrality, and respecting the autonomy of religious organizations\nby not compelling them to recognize same-sex marriage (Sunstein and\nThaler 2008). However, neither solution resolves the conflict between\nreligious autonomy and equality for same-sex relationships.\nPrivatization does not solve this conflict so long as religious\norganizations are involved in civil society\u2014for example, as\nemployers or benefit providers. The question is whether religious\nautonomy would allow them, in such roles, to exclude same-sex civil\nunions from benefits. Such exclusion could be defended as a matter of\nreligious autonomy; but it could also be objected to as unjust\ndiscrimination\u2014as it would be if, for example, equal treatment\nwere denied to inter-racial marriages.\n\nAnother issue raised by such a reform proposal is how to delimit the\nrelationships entitled to such recognition. Recall the new natural law\ncharge that liberalism entails an objectionable\n\u201cplasticicty\u201d regarding marriage (3.2.1). One question is\nwhether recognition should be extended to polygamous or polyamorous\nrelationships. Some defenders of same-sex marriage hold that their\narguments do not entail recognizing polygamy, due to its oppressive\neffects on women (Wedgwood 1999). However, some monogamous marriages\nare also oppressive (March 2011), and egalitarian polygamous or\npolyamorous relationships, such as a group of three women or three\nmen, exist (Emens 2004). Thus, oppressiveness does not cleanly\ndistinguish monogamous from polygamous relationships. Brooks has\nsought to show that polygamy is distinctively structurally\ninegalitarian as one party (usually the husband) can determine who\nwill join the marriage, whereas wives cannot (Brooks 2009). However,\nthis overlooks various possible configurations\u2014if a polygamous\n\u201csister wife,\u201d for instance, has the legal right to marry\noutside the existing marriage, there is no structural inequality\n(Strauss 2012). Most fundamentally, some authors have urged that a\npolitically liberal state should not prescribe the arrangements in\nwhich its competent adult members seek love, sex, and intimacy, so\nlong as they are compatible with justice (Calhoun 2005, March 2011).\nSome philosophers have argued that polygamists and polyamorous people\nare unjustly excluded from the benefits of marriage, and that legal\nrecognition of plural marriage - or small groups of friends \u2013\ncan preserve equality (Brake 2012, 2014, Den Otter 2015, Shrage 2016).\nFinally, the history of racialized stigmatization of polygamy gives\nreason to consider whether anti-polygamous intuitions rest on just\nfoundations (Denike 2010).\n\nConservatives also charge that the liberal approach cannot rule out\nincestuous marriage. While this topic has sparked less debate than\npolygamy, one defender of the civil-unions-for-all proposal has\npointed out that civil union status, as justified on politically\nliberal grounds, would not connote sexual or romantic involvement.\nThus, eligibility of adult family members for this status would not\nconvey state endorsement of incest; whether the state should prohibit\nor discourage incest is an independent question (March 2010).\n\nA further problem arises with the proposal to replace marriage with\ncivil unions on neutrality grounds. Civil unions, if they carry legal\nbenefits similar to marriage, would still involve legal discrimination\n(between members of civil unions and those who were not members)\nrequiring justification (for a specific example of this problem in the\narea of immigration law, see Ferracioli 2016). Depending on how\nrestrictive the entry criteria for civil unions were (for example,\nwhether more than two parties, blood relations, and those not\nromantically involved could enter) and how extensive the entitlements\nconferred by such unions were, the state would need to provide reason\nfor this discrimination. In the absence of compelling neutral reasons\nfor such differential treatment, liberty considerations suggest the\nstate should cease providing any special benefits to members of civil\nunions (or intimate relationships) (Vanderheiden 1999, cf. Sunstein\nand Thaler 2008). As noted in 4.2, some political liberals have sought\nto provide rationales showing why a liberal state should support\ncertain relationships; these rationales generate corresponding reform\nproposals. One approach focuses on protecting economically dependent\ncaregivers; Metz proposes replacing civil marriage with\n\u201cintimate care-giving unions\u201d which would protect the\nrights of dependent caregivers (Metz 2010; cf. Hartley and Watson\n2012). Another approach holds that caring relationships themselves -\nwhether friendships or romantic relationships - should be recognized\nas valuable by the politically liberal state, and it should,\naccordingly, distribute rights supporting them equally; the\ncorresponding reform proposal, \u201cminimal marriage,\u201d would\nprovide rights directly supporting relationships, but not economic\nbenefits, without restriction as to sex or number of parties or the\nnature of their caring relationship (Brake 2012). This would extend\nmarriage not only to polyamorists, but to asexuals and aromantics, as\nwell as those who choose to build their lives around friendships. A\nthird approach proposes that marital rights and status be replaced by\n\u201cpiecemeal directives\u201d which would regulate the various\nfunctional contexts to which marriage law now applies (such as\ncohabitation and co-parenting) (Chambers 2017); this proposal would\navoid designating any relationship type as entitled to special\ntreatment.\n\nMany of the views discussed to this point imply that current marriage\nlaw is unjust because it arbitrarily excludes some groups from\nbenefits; it follows, on such views, that marrying is to avail oneself\nof privileges unjustly extended. This seems to give reason for\nboycotting the institution, so long as some class of persons is\nunjustly excluded (Parsons 2008).\n\nBefore Obergefell, U.S. law was in patchwork regarding\nmarriages involving at least one transgender person \u2014\n\u201ctrans\u2014marriage,\u201d in Loren Cannon\u2019s term. As a\ntransgender person traveled from state to state, both their legal sex\nand marital status could change (Cannon 2009, 85). While some raised\nconcerns that the political rationales given for recognizing such\nmarriages (such as the possibility of penile-vaginal intercourse)\nreaffirmed heteronormative assumptions (Robson 2007), to other\ntheorists, the possibility of trans-marriage itself suggests the\ninstability or incoherence of legal gender categories and gendered\nrestrictions on marriage (Cannon 2009, Almeida 2012).\n",
