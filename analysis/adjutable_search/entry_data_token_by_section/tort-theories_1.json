    "main_text": "The Remedial Structure of Tort Law\n2. The Remedial Structure of Tort Law\n\nThe remedial structure of tort law reflects its nature as a part of\nprivate law. Unlike a criminal prosecution (but like an action for\nbreach of contract) a tort action is initiated by the aggrieved party\nrather than the state. Unlike a criminal prosecution, the remedy\nsought in a tort action does not involve incarceration or the payment\nof a fine to the state, but rather either the payment of damages to\nthe aggrieved party or, in a limited range of cases, an injunction\nrequiring the defendant to cease their wrongful activity. Courts also\ngive a range of more particular damage awards, including nominal\ndamages (to recognize the existence of a wrong), \u201cgeneral\ndamages\u201d for the tort of defamation (awarded for the fact of\ninjury in addition to \u201cspecial damages\u201d for clearly\nquantifiable losses), and aggravated damages for particularly\negregious instances of wrongdoing. In some instances, a court will\naward punitive damages, over and above those damages that are tied to\nthe magnitude of the wrong. As their name suggests, such damages have\na punitive dimension, but they differ in important ways from\npunishment for violation of the criminal law, both in the standard of\nproof that is applied to them and in the fact that they are awarded to\nthe injured party. The relation between punitive damages and the\nbroader structure and nature of tort law remains a matter of\ncontroversy, both in legal doctrine (punitive damages are very rare\noutside the United States) and in philosophical accounts.\n\nAs an area of private law, tort law also differs procedurally from\nother areas of law. Unlike a criminal case in which the standard of\nproof is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, the plaintiff in a\ntort action must only establish that it is more probable than not that\nthe defendant satisfied each of the elements of the tort. In the\nUnited States, tort cases are heard before civil juries. In the rest\nof the common law world, civil juries in tort actions for anything\nother than defamation are unusual; in these jurisdictions cases are\ndecided before a judge. In virtually all jurisdictions the vast\nmajority of tort litigation is settled before coming to trial.\n",
