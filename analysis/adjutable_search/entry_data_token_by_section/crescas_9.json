    "main_text": "Critiques of Aristotelian science || The definition of matter\n4.2 The definition of matter\n\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s opinion, all actual matter exists with certain\nproperties like dimension, quality (cold, warm, humid and dry) and\nweight. Crescas distinguishes between the different properties. In his\nopinion there are three different levels of material\n existence.[22]\n Matter in and of itself has no properties. The body is the unification\nof matter and dimensionality (i.e. matter in corporeal form). It is\npossible that a pure body without any other quality has actual\nexistence. The third level of material existence is the unification of\nthe corporeal form (matter) with some other unique form. This latter\nunification affords matter the additional properties of weight and\nquality.\n\n\nOne example of the way that Crescas uses this new definition is to\nrefute the proofs of Aristotle against the existence of infinity. In\nAristotle\u2019s opinion, two bodies cannot share the same space\nbecause of the property of dimension. The Greek philosopher concludes\nfrom this observation the impossibility of the existence of a void. The\ndefinition of a void is dimensional space without matter inside. Now if\nmatter can fill a void, and matter itself has dimensions, then it\nfollows that the dimensions of the matter can go inside the dimensions\nof the void. Aristotle concludes that this cannot be, for if\ndimensions can be shared, then we have to assume that two physical\nbodies could be in the same place at the same time \u2014 an absurdity\nthat would lead to other apparent absurdities, such as the entire world\nfitting inside a grain of mustard.\n\n\nCrescas refutes these proofs with his new definition of the different\nlevels of material existence. In his opinion, only the common\nexistence of matter and dimension cause the impermeability of the\nbody.  A body (matter and dimension) can go inside a void (only\ndimension), but not inside another body. In this argument we see\nCrescas utilize the work of the Jewish apostate Abner. Abner explained\nthe birth of Jesus (and transubstantiation) by the argument that Jesus\nis body without dimension and can go inside other bodies. Abner\nseparated the different properties of a body from the body itself for\nboth a philosophical goal (to prove that infinity exists) and a\ntheological goal (to strengthen certain Christian dogmas). Crescas\nrefutes this possibility by explaining the difference between a body\nthat has both matter and dimension and therefore cannot go inside\nanother such body and pure matter. Crescas distinguishes all\nproperties only from matter and not from bodies. In this way, Crescas\ncan utilize Abner\u2019s critiques of Aristotelian science without\naccepting the theological implications. (See Sadik 2008 for Abner\u2019s\nopinions.)\n",
