    "main_text": "Applications || Ethics\n4.2 Ethics\n\n\nUtilitarians, along with their descendants contemporary\nconsequentialists, hold that the rightness or wrongness of an act is\ndetermined by the moral goodness or badness of its consequences.  Some\nconsequentialists, such as (Railton 1984), interpret this to mean that\nwe ought to do whatever will in fact have the best consequences. But\nit is difficult\u2014perhaps impossible\u2014to know the long-term\nconsequences of our acts (Lenman 2000, Howard-Snyder 2007).  In light\nof this observation, Jackson (1991) argues that the right act is the\none with the greatest expected moral value, not the one that will in\nfact yield the best consequences.\n\n\nAs Jackson notes, the expected moral value of an act depends on\nwhich probability function we work with. Jackson argues that,\nwhile every probability function is associated with an\n\u201cought\u201d, the \u201cought\u201d that matters most to\naction is the one associated with the decision-maker\u2019s degrees of\nbelief at the time of action. Other authors claim priority for\nother \u201coughts\u201d: Mason (2013) favors the probability\nfunction that is most reasonable for the agent to adopt in response to\nher evidence, given her epistemic limitations, while Oddie and Menzies\n(1992) favor the objective chance function as a measure of objective\nrightness. (They appeal to a more complicated probability\nfunction to define a notion of \u201csubjective rightness\u201d for\ndecisionmakers who are ignorant of the objective chances.)\n\n\nStill others (Smart 1973, Timmons 2002) argue that even if that we\nought to do whatever will have the best consequences, expected utility\ntheory can play the role of a decision procedure when we are uncertain\nwhat consequences our acts will have. Feldman (2006) objects that\nexpected utility calculations are horribly impractical. In most\nreal life decisions, the steps required to compute expected utilities\nare beyond our ken: listing the possible outcomes of our acts,\nassigning each outcome a utility and a conditional probability given\neach act, and performing the arithmetic necessary to expected utility\ncalculations.\n\nThe expected-utility-maximizing version of consequentialism is not\nstrictly speaking a theory of rational choice. It is a theory\nof moral choice, but whether rationality requires us to do what is\nmorally best is up for debate.\n\n",
