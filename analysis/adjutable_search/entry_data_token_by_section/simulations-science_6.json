    "main_text": "Types of Computer Simulations || Monte Carlo Simulations\n2.4 Monte Carlo Simulations\n\n\nIn the scientific literature, there is another large class of\ncomputer simulations called Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations. MC\nsimulations are computer algorithms that use randomness to calculate\nthe properties of a mathematical model and where the randomness of the\nalgorithm is not a feature of the target model. A nice\nexample is the use of a random algorithm to calculate the value\nof \u03c0.  If you draw a unit square on a piece of\npaper and inscribe a circle in it, and then randomly drop a collection\nof objects inside the square, the proportion of objects that land in\nthe circle would be roughly equal to \u03c0/4. A\ncomputer simulation that simulated a procedure like that would be\ncalled a MC simulation for calculating \u03c0. \n\n\nMany philosophers of science have deviated from ordinary scientific\nlanguage here and have shied away from thinking of MC simulations as\ngenuine simulations. Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff and Weirich (2010) offer the\nfollowing reasoning: \u201cThe Monte Carlo approach does not have a\nmimetic purpose: It imitates the deterministic system not in order to\nserve as a surrogate that is investigated in its stead but only in\norder to offer an alternative computation of the deterministic\nsystem\u2019s properties\u201d (p.30). This shows that MC\nsimulations do not fit any of the above definitions aptly. On the\nother hand, the divide between philosophers and ordinary language can\nperhaps be squared by noting that MC simulations simulate an imaginary\nprocess that might be used for calculating something relevant to\nstudying some other process. Suppose I am modeling a planetary orbit\nand for my calculation I need to know the value of \u03c0. If I do the\nMC simulation mentioned in the last paragraph, I am simulating the\nprocess of randomly dropping objects into a square, but what I am\nmodeling is a planetary orbit. This is the sense in which MC\nsimulations are simulations, but they are not\nsimulations of the systems they are being used to study.\nHowever, as Beisbart and Norton (2012) point\nout, some MC simulations (viz. those that use MC techniques to solve\nstochastic dynamical equations referring to a physical system) are in\nfact simulations of the systems they study. \n",
