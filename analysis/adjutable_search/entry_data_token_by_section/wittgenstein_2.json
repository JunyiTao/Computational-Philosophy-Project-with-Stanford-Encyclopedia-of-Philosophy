    "main_text": "The Early Wittgenstein || Sense and Nonsense\n2.2 Sense and Nonsense\n\nIn the Tractatus Wittgenstein\u2019s logical construction of\na philosophical system has a purpose\u2014to find the limits of\nworld, thought, and language; in other words, to distinguish between\nsense and nonsense. \u201cThe book will \u2026 draw a limit to\nthinking, or rather\u2014not to thinking, but to the expression of\nthoughts \u2026. The limit can \u2026 only be drawn in language\nand what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply\nnonsense\u201d (TLP Preface). The conditions for a\nproposition\u2019s having sense have been explored and seen to rest\non the possibility of representation or picturing. Names must have a\nbedeutung (reference/meaning), but they can only do so in the\ncontext of a proposition which is held together by logical form. It\nfollows that only factual states of affairs which can be pictured can\nbe represented by meaningful propositions. This means that what can be\nsaid are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the\nrealm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used\nin language.\n\nThere are, first, the propositions of logic itself. These do not\nrepresent states of affairs, and the logical constants do not stand\nfor objects. \u201cMy fundamental thought is that the logical\nconstants do not represent. That the logic of the facts\ncannot be represented\u201d (TLP 4.0312). This is not a\nhappenstance thought; it is fundamental precisely because the limits\nof sense rest on logic. Tautologies and contradictions, the\npropositions of logic, are the limits of language and thought, and\nthereby the limits of the world. Obviously, then, they do not picture\nanything and do not, therefore, have sense. They are, in\nWittgenstein\u2019s terms, senseless (sinnlos). Propositions\nwhich do have sense are bipolar; they range within the\ntruth-conditions drawn by the truth-tables. But the propositions of\nlogic themselves are \u201cnot pictures of the reality \u2026 for\nthe one allows every possible state of affairs, the other\nnone\u201d (TLP 4.462). Indeed, tautologies (and\ncontradictions), being senseless, are recognized as true (or false)\n\u201cin the symbol alone \u2026 and this fact contains in itself\nthe whole philosophy of logic\u201d (TLP 6.113).\n\nThe characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the\npropositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form\nitself of the pictures that do represent. These are, like tautologies\nand contradictions, literally sense-less, they have no sense.\n\nBeyond, or aside from, senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies\nanother group of statements which cannot carry sense: the nonsensical\n(unsinnig) propositions. Nonsense, as opposed to\nsenselessness, is encountered when a proposition is even more\nradically devoid of meaning, when it transcends the bounds of sense.\nUnder the label of unsinnig can be found various\npropositions: \u201cSocrates is identical,\u201d but also \u201c1\nis a number\u201d and \u201cthere are objects.\u201d While some\nnonsensical propositions are blatantly so, others seem to be\nmeaningful\u2014and only analysis carried out in accordance with the\npicture theory can expose their nonsensicality. Since only what is\n\u201cin\u201d the world can be described, anything that is\n\u201coutside\u201d is denied meaningfulness, including the notion\nof limit and the limit points themselves. Traditional metaphysics, and\nthe propositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the\nworld as a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the\nvery notion of a subject, for it is also not \u201cin\u201d the\nworld but at its limit.\n\nWittgenstein does not, however, relegate all that is not inside the\nbounds of sense to oblivion. He makes a distinction between\nsaying and showing which is made to do additional\ncrucial work. \u201cWhat can be shown cannot be said,\u201d that is,\nwhat cannot be formulated in sayable (sensical) propositions can only\nbe shown. This applies, for example, to the logical form of the world,\nthe pictorial form, etc., which show themselves in the form of\n(contingent) propositions, in the symbolism, and in logical\npropositions. Even the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic)\npropositions of philosophy belong in this group\u2014which\nWittgenstein finally describes as \u201cthings that cannot be put\ninto words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is\nmystical\u201d (TLP 6.522).\n",
