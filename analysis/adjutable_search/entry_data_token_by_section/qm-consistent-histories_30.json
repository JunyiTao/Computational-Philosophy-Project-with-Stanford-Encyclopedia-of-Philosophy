    "main_text": "Paradoxes Resolved || Nonlocality paradoxes\n10.5 Nonlocality paradoxes\nAs discussed in section 8, the Bohm (spin\nsinglet) version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox has been\ninterpreted, by Bell and others, as indicating that quantum theory is\nnonlocal. Similar conclusions have been drawn from the Hardy and the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger paradoxes stated in a form which involves\nmeasurements at distinct physical locations. One can add to this list\nthe Elitzur-Vaidman indirect measurement\nparadox (Elitzur & Vaidman 1993),\nwhich again suggests some form of nonlocal influence. When critically\nexamined using the tools provided by the histories interpretation all\nevidence for nonlocality vanishes, for reasons discussed in\nsubsection 8.2.\n\n\n",
