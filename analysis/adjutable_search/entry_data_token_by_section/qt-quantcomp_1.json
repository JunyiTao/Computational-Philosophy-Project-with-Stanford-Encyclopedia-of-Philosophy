Apart from analog computation, there exist at\nleast two main kinds of example purporting to show that the notion of\nrecursion, or Turing-computability, is not a natural physical\nproperty (Pour-el and Richards 1981; Pitowsky 1990; Hogarth 1994).\nAlthough the physical systems involved (a specific initial condition\nfor the wave equation in three dimensions and an exotic solution to\nEinstein\u2019s field equations, respectively) are somewhat\ncontrived, a thriving school of \u201chypercomputation\u201d that\naspires to extend the limited examples of physical\n\u201chypercomputers\u201d and in so doing to physically\n\u201ccompute\u201d the non-Turing-computable has nevertheless\nemerged (for a review see Copeland (2002); for a criticism: Davis\n(2003); for a recent proposal and response to criticisms see\nAndr\u00e9ka et al. (2018)). Quantum hypercomputation is\nrarely discussed in the literature (see, e.g., Adamyan, Calude, and\nPavlov 2004), but the most concrete attempt to harness quantum theory\nto compute the non-computable is the suggestion to use the quantum\nadiabatic algorithm (see below) to solve Hilbert\u2019s Tenth Problem\n(Kieu 2002, 2004)\u2014a Turing-undecidable problem equivalent to the\nhalting problem. Criticism, however, has exposed the unphysical\ncharacter of the alleged quantum adiabatic hypercomputer (see Hodges\n2005; Hagar and Korolev 2007).\n\nSetting aside \u201chypercomputers\u201d, even if we restrict\nourselves only to Turing-computable functions, one can still find many\nproposals in the literature that purport to display\n\u201cshort-cuts\u201d in computational resources. Consider, e.g.,\nthe DNA model of computation that was claimed (Adleman 1994; Lipton\n1995) to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial\ntime. A closer inspection shows that the cost of the computation in\nthis model is still exponential since the number of molecules in the\nphysical system grows exponentially with the size of the problem. Or\ntake an allegedly instantaneous solution to another\nNP-complete problem using a construction of rods and\nballs (Vergis, Steiglitz, and Dickinson 1986) that unfortunately\nignores the accumulating time-delays in the rigid rods that result in\nan exponential overall slowdown. It appears that these and other\nsimilar models cannot serve as counter-examples to the physical\nChurch-Turing thesis (as far as complexity is concerned) since they\nall require some exponential physical resource. Note, however, that\nall these models are based on classical physics, hence the unavoidable\nquestion: Can the shift to quantum physics allow us to find\n\u201cshort-cuts\u201d in computational resources? The quest for the\nquantum computer began with the possibility of giving a positive\nanswer to this question.\n",
