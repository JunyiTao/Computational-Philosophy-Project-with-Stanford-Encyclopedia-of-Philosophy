    "main_text": "Tools for Inference || Hypothetical Logic\n6.2 Hypothetical Logic\n\nA hypothetical sentence consists of two shorter sentences joined\ntogether, as in the connected (mutta\u1e63il) form \u201cIf\np then q\u201d or the separated\n(munfa\u1e63il) form \u201cEither p or\nq\u201d. For the logic of these sentences,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b confines his attention almost entirely to\nsimple inferences like modus ponens:\n\n\nIf this visible thing is a human, then it is an animal; but it is a\nhuman. Therefore it is an animal.\n\n\nor an inference with exclusive disjunction:\n\n\nThis number is either even or odd; but it is even. Therefore it is not\nodd.\n\n\nHis treatment is so similar to the contents of Boethius\u2019 De\nSyllogismis Hypotheticis that they must have drawn on a common\nsource now lost. \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b points out that hypothetical sentences can be\nchained so as to form \u201ccompound syllogisms\u201d, as for\nexample in\n\n\nEither p or q. If p then not r. If not\nr then s. If s then t. Not t.\nTherefore q. \n\n\nThis formalizes an argument at his [Short Syllogism]\n90.6\u20139. He also gives examples of categorical syllogisms chained\ntogether\u2014though these can be found already in Aristotle. \n",
