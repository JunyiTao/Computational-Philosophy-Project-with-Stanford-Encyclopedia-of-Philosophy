His immense philosophical and other written output\nencompasses most areas of philosophy as well as a host of other\neducational, social and political concerns. Although much of\nDewey\u2019s political writing is prompted by specific issues, his\noverall orientation is deeply shaped by his pragmatism or (as he\npreferred) \u201cexperimentalism\u201d. At the core of his political\nthinking are the beliefs that science and democracy are mutually\nsupportive and interdependent enterprises, that they are egalitarian,\nprogressive and rest on habits of open social communication, and that\npowerful interpretations of liberal individualism and democracy have\nbecome ossified and self-defeating.\n\nDewey\u2019s earliest philosophical work was deeply influenced by the\nidealism imbibed from his teacher and colleague George S. Morris.\nThrough the 1890s, and particularly after moving to the newly founded\nUniversity of Chicago in 1894, Dewey began a steady drift away from\nidealist metaphysics, a process that he describes in an\nautobiographical essay \u201cFrom Absolutism to\nExperimentalism\u201d. Influenced notably by William James\u2019s\nPrinciples of Psychology (1890), Dewey came to repudiate both\nthe Idealist\u2019s claim that the study of empirical phenomena leads\nto the conclusion that the world is mind, and the belief that the only\nalternative to this is an atomistic empiricism. Yet he retained the\nIdealist ambition of articulating a unified account of human progress.\nWhile at Chicago Dewey\u2019s interest in educational theory and\nconception of the school as a central institution for a democratic\nsociety came to fruition, in the foundation of the University\nElementary School (the \u201cLab School\u201d), and in books such as\nThe School and Society (1899), The Child and the\nCurriculum (1902), and later in the culminating statement\nDemocracy and Education (1916). After a dispute with the\nuniversity president, Dewey left Chicago in 1904 for Columbia\nUniversity, where he remained until his retirement.\n\nThe period between the wars also saw an imposing series of books\narticulating and developing his philosophical beliefs. This includes\nReconstruction in Philosophy (1920), Human Nature and\nConduct (1922), Experience and Nature (1925), The\nQuest for Certainty (1929), Art as Experience (1934),\nA Common Faith (1934), Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\n(1938), and Theory of Valuation (1939). The Public and\nIts Problems (1927) contained a defence of participatory\ndemocratic ideals against sceptics such as Walter Lippmann, who argued\nthat there was only space for a minimally democratic politics in\ncomplex modern societies. Dewey was a critic of laissez-faire\nliberalism and its accompanying individualistic view of society from\nhis early writings. This criticism was amplified during the\nDepression, where he expressed a form of liberal and democratic\nsocialism in writings such as Individualism, Old and New\n(1930), Liberalism and Social Action (1935), and Freedom\nand Culture (1939).\n\nAs a public intellectual, Dewey was a supporter of such causes as\nwomen\u2019s suffrage and the Settlement House movement (he was a\nfrequent visitor to the philosopher Jane Addams\u2019s and Ellen\nGates Starr\u2019s famous Hull House in Chicago). He lectured to\ninternational audiences and his educational writing in particular was\ninfluential in a wide range of settings, including notably China. His\nimmense range of public and political activities included presidency\nof the teachers\u2019 union, sponsorship of the American Civil\nLiberties Union and NAACP, support for the Outlawry of War movement in\nthe interwar years, chairing the People\u2019s Lobby, and (persuaded\nby his student, the philosopher Sidney Hook) participation in the\n\u201ctrial\u201d of Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1938. After his move\nto New York, and particularly after the onset of the First World War,\na substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on\ncurrent domestic and international politics, and public statements on\nbehalf of many causes, both domestic and international. (He is\nprobably the only philosopher in this Encyclopaedia to have published\nboth on the Treaty of Versailles and on the value of displaying art in\npost offices.) Among these commitments, his support for the entry of\nthe United States into the First World War was hugely controversial,\nstrained or broke many of his ties with the American left, and came to\nbe a source of profound disillusionment. In a way, it marked the\nhighpoint of his belief that the American state could be tethered to\ndemocratic goals without thoroughgoing reconstruction. He went on to\nbe a prominent critic from the left of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal\nwhile also opposing Soviet communism and its western apologists. By\nthe time of his death he was lionized as a national sage (as with\nBertrand Russell, this status was compatible with his promotion of\ncontroversial and often radical public positions). Although his\nphilosophical reputation and public status dimmed somewhat in\nsubsequent years, his work has consolidated in stature as an important\nreference point and resource for democratic theory.\n", "toc": [{"#SituDewePoliPhil": "1.

Situating Dewey\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\nFrom a very early point of his intellectual development, Dewey, like\nthe British idealist T. H. Green (on whom he wrote several essays),\naccepted that traditional liberalism in part rested on a false\nconception of the individual, which was ethically pernicious in its\neffect on liberal thought. Accordingly, many of the themes that\ncharacterised Dewey\u2019s thinking about social and political theory\nafter his turn to \u201cexperimentalism\u201d were present in his\nearlier, overtly idealist political philosophy. In texts such as\n\u201cThe Ethics of Democracy\u201d (EW1) and\n\u201cChristianity and Democracy\u201d (EW4), Dewey\nelaborates a version of the idealist criticisms of classical liberal\nindividualism. For this line of criticism, classical liberalism\nenvisages the individual as an independent entity in competition with\nother individuals, and takes social and political life as a sphere in\nwhich this competitive pursuit of self-interest is coordinated. By\ncontrast, the idealists rejected this view of social and political\nlife as the aggregation of inherently conflicting private interests.\nInstead, they sought to view individuals relationally: individuality\ncould be sustained only where social life was understood as an\norganism in which the well-being of each part was tied to the\nwell-being of the whole. Freedom in a positive sense consisted not\nmerely in the absence of external constraints but the positive fact of\nparticipation in such an ethically desirable social order. On this\nfoundation, Dewey rebuts Henry Maine\u2019s bleak assessment in\nPopular Government that democracy is the rule of the ignorant\nmajority. While it is important that voters can reject their rulers\nand so control them to some extent, democracy is not simply a form of\ngovernment defined by the distribution of the franchise or majority\nrule. Rather what matters, as Dewey puts it, is the way that the\nmajority is formed. To understand that requires grasping what Maine\nmisses, in Dewey\u2019s view: that \u201cmen are not isolated\nnon-social atoms, but are men only when in intrinsic relations\u201d\nto one another, and the state in turn only represents them \u201cso\nfar as they have become organically related to one another, or are\npossessed of unity of purpose and interest\u201d (\u201cThe Ethics\nof Democracy\u201d, EW1, 231\u20132). Democracy is a form of\nmoral and spiritual association that recognizes the contribution that\neach member can make in his or her particular way to this ethical\ncommunity. And each of us can contribute to this community since we\neach only become the individuals we are through our engagement in the\ninstitutions and practices of our society.\n\nOther important themes also appear in these early statements. Dewey is\nanti-elitist, and argues that the capacity of the wise few to discern\nthe public interest tends to be distorted by their position.\nDemocratic participation is not only viewed as a bulwark against\ngovernment by elites, but also as an aspect of individual freedom\n\u2013 humanity cannot rest content with a good \u201cprocured from\nwithout\u201d. Democracy is not \u201csimply and solely a form of\ngovernment\u201d, but a social and personal ideal; in other words, it\nis not only a property of political institutions but of a wide range\nof social relationships. This ideal is common to a range of social\nspheres, and should take \u201cindustrial, as well as civil and\npolitical\u201d forms (\u201cThe Ethics of Democracy\u201d,\nEW1, 246). It also has a religious dimension. Through\ndemocracy in this expansive and ideal sense,\n\nthe incarnation of God in man \u2026 becomes a living, present thing\n\u2026 The truth is brought down to life, its segregation removed;\nit is made a common trust enacted in all departments of action, not in\none isolated sphere called religious. (\u201cChristianity and\nDemocracy\u201d, EW4, 9)\n\n\nWhile the Christian conception of democracy recedes (but does not\nentirely disappear) in Dewey\u2019s later work, the idea that\ndemocracy should be viewed as a form of relationship that encompasses\nand unifies different spheres of social life remains important.\nDewey\u2019s later work is more questioning of the traditional\nethical standards and ideals that he appeals to in an essay like\n\u201cThe Ethics of Democracy\u201d. He is also sharply critical of\nwhat he sees as the residual Kantianism in Green\u2019s ethics of\nself-realization, although the general orientation remains:\nindividuals are not presocial atoms, and democracy in an ideal sense\nis a primarily social and ethical ideal rather than a method of\nmajority rule through voting.\n\nThree features of Dewey\u2019s wider conception of knowledge and\nvalue as he develops them in his later work are particularly important\nfor his political thinking: anti-absolutism, experimentalism, and\nnaturalism. The first strand of Dewey\u2019s philosophy is his\nscepticism about what he calls an \u201cabsolutistic\u201d\nconception of social and political philosophy. Dewey gathers some\ndifferent ideas under this heading but at its core it is the belief\nthat there are certain ahistorical and foundational features of the\nsocial world and that social and political philosophy should consist\nin identifying these features and using them to diagnose and evaluate\nsocial and political problems. This anti-absolutism is expressed in\nvarious ways by Dewey. In one version of this idea is the argument\nthat \u201cthe logic of general notions\u201d provides an idealised\npicture of agents and institutions that is too abstract to contribute\nto the kind of experimental inquiry that Dewey thinks we need in\nsocial thought (Reconstruction in Philosophy, MW12,\n187). For example:\n\nWe want to know about the worth of the institution of private property\nas it operates under given conditions of definite time and place. We\nmeet with the reply of Proudhon that property generally is theft, or\nwith that of Hegel that the realization of will is the end of all\ninstitutions, and that private ownership as the expression of mastery\nof personality over physical nature is a necessary element in such\nrealization \u2026. They are general answers supposed to have a universal\nmeaning that covers and dominates all particulars. Hence they do not\nassist in inquiry. They close it. They are not instrumentalities to be\nemployed and tested in clarifying concrete social difficulties. They\nare ready-made principles to be imposed upon particulars in order to\ndetermine their nature. (Reconstruction in Philosophy,\nMW12, 188)\n\n\nDewey diagnoses the same defect of absolutism in the more\n\u201cprofessedly empirical\u201d social theory of J. S. Mill\n(1843), for whom certain \u201csocial laws, normative and regulative,\nat all periods and under all circumstances of proper social life were\nassumed to exist\u201d (Public and Its Problems,\nLW2, 357). On this view, society is an aggregate of\nindividual human minds and the purpose of social science is to derive\nthe laws governing these aggregates. Dewey argues that this ignores\nthe extent to which the content of individual beliefs, desires and\npurposes are given by the social context in which individuals live and\nselves are socially constituted: the individual should not be\n\u201cregarded as something given, something already\nthere\u201d \u2013 social institutions are \u201cmeans for\ncreating individuals\u201d (Reconstruction in\nPhilosophy, MW12, 190, 192). Mill\u2019s individualism\nexemplifies what he describes as \u201cthe most pervasive fallacy of\nphilosophical thinking\u201d (\u201cContext and Thought\u201d,\nLW5, 5). This is the tendency to divide up experienced\nphenomena, and to take the distinct analysed elements to be separate\nexistences, independent both of the analysis and of each other. That\nthis abstraction is in particular circumstances essential for inquiry\nis an important theme in Dewey\u2019s philosophy. But this\nabstraction goes wrong \u201cwhenever the distinctions or elements\nthat are discriminated are treated as if they were final and\nself-sufficient\u201d (\u201cContext and Thought\u201d,\nLW5, 7), as when classical liberalism treats the individuals\nas \u201csomething given\u201d, ontologically prior to the\nsocial groups of which they are members. His anti-absolutist point,\nhowever, is not to claim the universal explanatory primacy of the\nsocial (a position associated with Hegel and the idealism of Green and\nF. H. Bradley that he had come to reject) or to object to the idea\nthat the individuals can be abstracted from their social context for\ncertain analytical purposes but with the idea that this abstracted\nindividual provides the firm foundation for a fixed and ahistorical\nexplanatory framework for social theory.\n\nA second sort of absolutism that Dewey rejects is the idea that there\nis a fixed and ahistorical standard of social evaluation using\ncritical standards derived from \u201cconsideration of the ultimate\nnature of things \u2013 God, the Universe, Man, Reason\u201d\n(Syllabus Social Institutions and the Study of Morals, MW15,\n233). The group of philosophers guilty of this kind of\nabsolutism includes Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Spinoza and Hegel.\nHe also diagnoses this absolutism in philosophers who define the good\nwith reference to the psychology of personal and private\nconsciousness, encompassing not only hedonistic versions of\nutilitarianism but also theories of personal conscience associated\nwith Protestantism. These standards gain \u201coutside\nleverage\u201d only by being \u201cabsolutistic and non-historical,\nand, in effect, partisan, since they choose their outside standard to\nserve the purpose they have in mind, and there is no objective check\nupon their choice\u201d. Dewey develops a kind of ideological\ncriticism of traditional philosophy as prone to mistaking contingent\n(and convenient) social products for unchangeable features of human\nnature. Famously, for example, he thinks that the philosophical\npreference for \u201cintrinsic\u201d goods of contemplation and\nrelated values such as aesthetic purity originally reflect a form of\nGreek society structured around a slave class and a leisured class but\nis reproduced (with increasing difficulty) in other class-divided\nsocieties. Instead, what Dewey says that social criticism should be\ngoverned by what he calls \u201can immanent standard\u201d:\n\u201cthis is relative to phenomena but at the same time it is\nexperimental and hence it is checked up by social processes similar to\nthose which suggest it\u201d (Syllabus Social Institutions and\nthe Study of Morals, MW15, 234). This is not an appeal to a\nconventionalist or relativist idea that the standards for judging a\npractice are whatever happens to be prevalent or identifiable in a\ncommunity since, unless we define social groups in a moralistic way,\nthese can include groups \u201cbanded together in a criminal\nconspiracy, business aggregations that prey upon the public while\nserving it, political machines held together by the interests of\nplunder\u201c (Democracy and Education, MW9, 88):\nso not just any set of standards is valuable. Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalism and his naturalism each form parts of his alternative\nto this conventionalist interpretation of immanent standards.\n\nThe experimentalist conception of what he calls intelligence or\ninquiry as problem-solving is intended as an account of human\nepistemic practices. We don\u2019t chase the impossible goal of\ncertainty, he thinks, and there are no epistemological foundations\navailable to guarantee that we have achieved it. The goal of an\ninquiry is not to arrive at a certain picture of the nature of things,\nbut to come up with what is an inevitably provisional solution to the\npractical and intellectual problem that sparked it. Inquiry has\nreached its apogee in the successes of modern science, medicine, and\nengineering but is continuous with, and arises from, mundane processes\nof inquiry and problem-solving or, as he put it in a text for\neducationalists, with How We Think (MW6,\nLW8). Inquiry should be understood as part of our struggle\nwith an objectively precarious but improvable environment. Inquiry is\ndemanded by what he calls an \u201cincomplete\u201d or\n\u201cproblematic\u201d situation, that is, one in which our\ninherited habits and standard ways of doing things run into trouble,\nperhaps through our actions\u2019 having unexpected consequences,\nthrough our having developed new needs and desires that are unmet in\ncurrent circumstances, or through conflict among our own goals and\nprojects or with those of others. These challenges prompt us to step\nback, identify the problem that confronts us, and reflect on what to\ndo next. Modern societies have an awesome exemplar of successful\ninquiry, in the natural sciences which, Dewey argues, have been\nprogressive and cumulative, giving us greater and greater\nunderstanding and control of the natural world. This has above all\nbeen the result of their experimental character, in which no\nintellectual element is taken to be beyond rational scrutiny. Theories\nand hypotheses are invented, used, tested, revised, and so on. At the\nsame time, new methods for the invention, use, testing and revision of\ntheories and hypotheses are developed and refined, and so are new\nstandards for evaluating theories and hypotheses. What counts as\nsuccess in inquiry is some practice\u2019s meeting these standards,\nbut these standards themselves may be judged in the light of how they\nsquare with ongoing practices of inquiry. In this way, the methods\nused by science are not fixed but themselves have a history and\ndevelop progressively and sometimes in unexpected ways. A crucial\ndimension of the experience that has established these standards and\npractices is social or communal, as we must look to the community of\nour fellow inquirers for testing and confirmation of our findings.\n\nDewey\u2019s conception of inquiry is intended as a general model of\nreflective intelligence: we struggle with problems in all sorts of\nareas of human experience, including art and ethics. Accordingly he\nrejects non-cognitivism about values and holds that values can be true\nor false in his pragmatic sense, responsive to reasons and corrigible\nin the light of experience. He argues that we should generally think\nof values or ideals as hypotheses about what course of action to take,\nforged reflectively in response to problematic situations, with the\naim of providing means for what Dewey calls their \u201cdirected\nresolution\u201d (most fully in these terms in the late work,\nTheory of Valuation (LW13)). Practical inquiry\nencompasses instrumental reasoning about means: so if we our path to\nthe beach is blocked by a giant rock (the problematic situation) we\ncan reflect on what it would involve to take another route, to climb\nthe rock, to dynamite it, etc., and can imaginatively rehearse the\noptions. This inquiry also includes reflective criticism of ends: if\nthe journey now has to include arduous rock-climbing, we may\nreconsider how important our end of getting to the beach is, or of the\nvalue we attach to it. Inquiry as practical judgment involves\nreflecting on, criticising and revising our ends, in the light of what\nis involved for us in achieving them, and this often leads us\ncreatively to transform our values and to develop new ends.\n\nIn this context, Dewey develops a particular conception of moral\ntheory. Deliberation as inquiry is concerned with judging ends and\nchoosing means to achieve those ends. There are situations, though, in\nwhich an agent is presented with a conflict of ends or goals which is\nnot straightforwardly susceptible to being settled by reference to\nsome higher order end possessed by the agent. In the case of ethics, a\nmoral problem presents \u201calternative ends so heterogeneous\u201d\nthat they appeal to different kinds of disposition in the agent\n(Ethics, first edition, MW5, 192). Dewey and Tufts\ngive as an example a pacifist citizen whose state goes to war:\n\nHe is deeply attached to his own state. He has formed habits of\nloyalty and of abiding by its laws, and now one of its decrees is that\nhe shall support war. He feels in addition gratitude and affection for\nthe country which has sheltered and nurtured him. But his believes\nthat this war is unjust, or perhaps he has a condition that all war is\na form of murder and hence wrong. One side of his nature, one set of\nconvictions and habits, leads him to acquiesce in war; another deep\npart of his being protests. He is torn between two duties: he\nexperiences a conflict between the incompatible values presented to\nhim by his habits of citizenship and by his religious beliefs\nrespectively. Up to this time, he has never experienced a struggle\nbetween the two; they have coincided and reenforced one another. Now\nhe has to make a choice between competing moral loyalties and\nconvictions. The struggle is not between a good which is clear to him\nand something else which attracts him but which he knows to be wrong.\nIt is between values each of which is an undoubted good in its place\nbut which now get in each other\u2019s way. He is forced to reflect\nin order to come to a decision. Moral theory is a generalised\nextension of the kind of thinking in which he now engages.\n(Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7, 165)\n\n\nIn spite of his doubts about moral theory as an external standard for\njudging social institutions, Dewey isn\u2019t a sceptic about\ninherited moral theory. Rather, he interprets it as as a repertoire of\nconceptual resources and tools that we have for dealing with the\nproblems of value judgement in a world of plural and changing values.\nIn Ethics, Dewey and Tufts offer an interpretation of\ndifferent canonical value theories, teleology, deontology and virtue\nethics as providing contrasting methodological orientations for\nidentifying, describing and solving problems. Moral theories are\ngenerated in contingent historical circumstances, are responsive to\nthe particular needs and conflicts of those circumstances, and reflect\ntheir prejudices and assumption. Ideals and values that were\nfunctional for a particular social order can cease to make sense or\nbecome dysfunctional as that order changes. Instead of asking which of\nthese approaches best captures \u201cour intuitions\u201d and so\nshould be used as an unvarying standard to guide decision-making in\nconcrete situations, Dewey argues that no one approach constitutes a\ntheoretically adequate guide to how to act in particular situations.\nInstead, these provide standpoints from which agents can identify and\nanalyze problems, sift important from unimportant considerations, and\nwork out whether what we desire or value is really desirable or\nvaluable. Conflict among these approaches cannot be resolved in\ntheory, only in practice and in particular contexts, if at all, where\nan agent must make \u201cthe best adjustment he can among forces\nwhich are genuinely disparate\u201d (\u201cThree Independent Factors\nin Morals\u201d, MW5, 288). Recall his claim that immanent\ncriticism has the virtue of being \u201cexperimental and hence \u2026\nchecked up by social processes similar to those which suggest\nit\u201d. Experimentalism is immanent in the sense that it is carried\nout and embodied by particular agents confronted with the particular\nproblems they grapple with, agents who are themselves constituted by\nthe social habitat they grapple with, and uses the criteria of\njudgment provided by that habitat. At the same time, it is\nexperimental in the sense that the exercise of intelligence does not\ninvolve unreflectively applying these criteria but reflectively\ntesting and challenging them in the light of experience. At the social\nlevel, the model of ethical deliberation is not that of trying to\nimplement a given standard:\n\nthe process of growth, of improvement and progress, rather than the\nstatic outcome and result, becomes the significant thing. Not health\nas an end fixed once and for all, but the needed improvement in health\n\u2013 a continual process \u2013 is the end and good. The end is no\nlonger a terminus or limit to be reached. It is the active process of\ntransforming the existing situation. Not perfection as a final goal,\nbut the ever-enduring process of perfecting, maturing, refining is the\naim in living \u2026 Growth itself is the only moral \u201cend\u201d.\n(Reconstruction in Philosophy, MW12, 181)\n\n\nAs Dewey and Tufts put it, this experimentalism tells us about\n\u201cthe method by which the criterion should be reached and the\nspirit in which it is employed, namely, the experimental.That\nstatement concerns the form of the criterion rather than its content\nor substance\u201d (Ethics, 2nd edition\n, LW7, 343). This is not all that can be said about the\ncontent of a criterion of social judgment, however: Dewey and Tufts go\non to explain that \u201ctheir position is that past experience\nenables us to state a criterion of judgment which is sufficiently\ndefinite to be usable and sufficiently flexible to lead to its own\nreinterpretation as experience progresses\u201d ((Ethics,\n2nd edition, LW7, 343) \u2013 to tell us\nsomething about content or substance, in other words. Dewey provides a\nhistoricised form of ethical naturalism, which fleshes out the\ncriterion of social judgment. In this vein, Dewey says that \u201cthe\nmeasure of the worth of any social institution, economic, domestic,\npolitical, legal, religious, is its effect in enlarging and improving\nexperience\u201d (Democracy and Education, MW9, 9).\nOne way in which we can see Dewey\u2019s account as substantive is in\nthe practical virtues that he thinks accompany the commitment to\nexperimentalism. Social practices that promote free and open learning\nhave the instrumental epistemic benefits of growing knowledge and\nunderstanding, increasing the capacity to control experience, and\nproviding a richer and more dynamic environment, and we benefit if we\nare prepared to be open-minded in dealing with this environment.\nBeyond this, though, Dewey has a conception of what it is to judge a\nsocial group based on its relationship to its members. For example, he\nwrites in Democracy and Education:\n\nNow in any social group whatsoever, even in a gang of thieves, we find\nsome interest held in common and we find a certain amount of\ninteraction and cooperative intercourse with other groups. From these\ntwo traits we derive our standard. How numerous and varied are the\ninterests which are consciously shared? How full and free is the\ninterplay with other forms of association? If we apply these\nconsiderations to, say, the members of a criminal band, we find that\nthe ties which consciously hold the members together are few in\nnumber, reducible almost to a common interest in plunder; and that\nthey are of such a nature as to isolate the group from other groups\nwith respect to give and take of the values of life. Hence the\neducation such a society gives is partial and distorted. If we take,\non the other hand, the kind of family life which illustrates the\nstandard, we find that there are material, intellectual, aesthetic\ninterests in which all participate and that the progress of one member\nhas worth for the experience of other members \u2013 it is readily\ncommunicable \u2013 and that the family is not an isolated whole, but\nenters intimately into relationships with business interests, with\nschools, with all the agencies of culture, as well as with other\nsimilar groups, and that it plays a due part in the political\norganisation and in return receives support from it. In short, there\nare many interests consciously communicated and shared; and there are\nvaried and free modes of association with other modes of association.\n(MW9, 89)\n\n\nAuthoritarian or anti-social groups have to stunt their members\u2019\ninterests and allegiances in order to maintain their hold over them.\nAs Dewey puts it, reflecting on the gang of thieves in The Public\nand Its Problems, it is possible for a member of the gang\n\u201cto express his powers in a way consonant with belonging to that\ngroup and be directed by the interest common to its members\u201d but\nhe can do so \u201conly at the cost of repression of his\npotentialities which can be realized only through membership of other\ngroups\u201d and through \u201cthe free give-and-take\u201d that is\nthe condition for \u201cthe fullness of integrated personality\u201d\n(LW2, 328). The free communication of interests and open\ninteraction within and beyond a group provide a standard for judging\nsocial groups. This is also in a certain sense formal, since as a\ncriterion it is not a moral demand with a particular determinate\ncontent but is itself a tool for dealing with experience to be used or\napplied experimentally by the individuals involved.\n2. Reconstructing Liberalism\n\nOne of the legacies of Green\u2019s idealism and of Dewey\u2019s\nengagement with the New Liberals was the project of recasting\nliberalism in an appropriate form for modern societies. The core or at\nleast viable component of liberalism is a commitment to\u201cliberty\nand the opportunity of all individuals to secure full realization of\ntheir potentialities\u201d (Liberalism and Social Action,\nLW11, 38). Moral theories, as we have seen, can be viewed as\nconstructs to solve practical problems. Like an outmoded piece of\ntechnology, a past value which was once constructed to address a\nproblem in one set of circumstances can outlive its usefulness, and\nbecome a hindrance to the capacity of those in the present to deal\nwith their practical needs and worries. This, Dewey believes, is the\ncase with the theory of classical or laissez-faire\nliberalism. As he puts it, \u201cthe slogans of liberalism in\none period can become the bulwarks of reaction\u201d in the next\n(\u201cLogical Method and Law\u201d, MW15, 76). For Dewey\nthis does not provide a reason to reject liberalism, however although\nhe is sensitive to the allure of anti-liberal thought. Rather,\nliberalism it for modern societies, usually in a more socialist\nand radical direction. Throughout his political writings, he develops\nthis thought in discussing the relation of individual and society, the\ncharacter and value of freedom, and the scope of legitimate social and\npolitical action.\n\nDewey\u2019s treatment of the genealogy of classical liberalism is\nnuanced but in summary he sees it as a doctrine committed to the\nuniversal moral primacy of the individual possessed of pre-societal\nrights, including liberties of thought and action, which it is the\nsole business of the state to protect (Liberalism and Social\nAction, LW11, 7). This meant that the main opponent of\nliberty was seen as government because of its tendency to encroach on\nthese innate liberties. The abstraction of the individual from social\ncontext in classical liberalism shapes its normative theory. If the\nindividual is thought of as existing prior to social institutions,\nthen it is easier to envisage securing freedom for the individual in\npurely negative terms as solely consisting in the removal of external\nimpediments on individual action, such as legal restrictions on\nfreedom of speech. For classical liberalism or \u201cold\nindividualism\u201d, freedom is taken to consist in the absence of\nsome intentional constraint on the individual\u2019s ability to\npursue his or her chosen goals and the individual is viewed as\nsurrounded by a protective cordon of rights, which define his or her\nfreedom. While removal of external constraints may sometimes be very\nimportant for supplying the conditions of liberty, liberty in the\nsense in which it is a value for liberals does not consist in the mere\nabsence of external constraint. For Dewey, this negative view of\nfreedom is at the root of the wider social, ethical and political\ndefects of this form of individualism (\u201cReligion and Morality in\na Free Society\u201d, LW15, 181). While the anti-historical\ncharacter of classical liberalism at one point provided it with a\ncertain ideological advantage, since it allowed it to attack appeals\nto tradition, it meant that it failed to see the historically\nconditioned character of its interpretations of liberty and\nindividuality. This failure of historical self-awareness means that\nclassical liberalism neglects or suppresses an understanding of the\ncentral challenges to liberty and in effect becomes an instrument of\nplutocratic interests.\n\nBy contrast, as we have seen, Dewey rejects the philosophical\nabsolutism of a fixed and ahistorical conception of the self and\nargues that a genuine liberalism views the individual as\n\u201cnothing fixed, given ready-made. It is something achieved, and\nachieved not in isolation but with the aid and support of conditions,\ncultural and physical: \u2013 including in \u2018cultural\u2019,\neconomic, legal and political institutions as well as science and\nart\u201d (\u201cThe Future of Liberalism\u201d, LW11:\n291). One argument Dewey makes is for the \u201chistoric\nrelativity\u201d of what constitutes a constraint on individual\nliberty. At one time it made sense to say that dynastic despotic rule\nor inherited legal customs were the main obstacles to individual\nfreedom. Today, however, liberty signifies \u201cliberation from\nmaterial insecurity and from the coercions and repressions that\nprevent multitudes from participation in the vast cultural resources\nthat are to hand\u201d (Liberalism and Social Action,\nLW11, 38). It is a historically relative matter what\nconstitutes a constraint on individual freedom, however. By\nattempting to mask this as well as by promoting an outdated conception\nof what these constraints must be, classical liberalism has come to\nsubvert liberalism\u2019s core commitments to liberty and\nindividuality.\n\nDewey goes beyond this historicization, however. In the sense in which\nfreedom is a substantive value for liberals, what is valuable about it\nis not the negative absence of constraints but the positive\n\u201cpower to be an individualized self\u201d (The Public and\nIts Problems, LW2, 329). Individuality in what we may\ncall a weak sense is universally possessed and consists in the\nparticular patterns of response to the environment that each person\ndisplays, \u201ca distinctive way of feeling the impacts of the world\nand of showing a preferential bias in response to these impacts\u201d\n(Individualism Old and New, LW5, 121). In the\nstronger sense in which it is a value for liberals, according to\nDewey, individuality consists in the personal capacity for\nchoice, \u201cthe most characteristic activity of a\nself\u201d (Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7,\n285). This is not a matter of having the capacity only for arbitrarily\nor whimsically plumping for one option rather than another. Rather,\nchoice that is expressive of your individuality in the strong sense\ninvolves your intelligent criticism and appraisal of options.\nAccordingly, we can understand why Dewey claims that \u201cto foresee\nfuture objective alternatives and to be able by deliberation to choose\none of them and thereby weigh its chances in the struggle for future\nexistence, measures our freedom\u201d (Human Nature and\nConduct, MW14, 210). The alternative to intelligent\nself-direction is action according to whatever notions individuals\nhave picked up from their environment, including not only unreflective\nimpulses but propaganda (the \u201cflood of mass suggestion\u201d\nthat he identifies with the media revolution of the early twentieth\ncentury), class ideologies and \u201cthe monotonous round of imagery\nflowing from illiberal interests, broken only by wild forays into the\nillicit\u201d (Ethics, 1st edition, MW5, 392). It\nfollows that possession and exercise of this capacity for individuality\nrequire the right social conditions. Throughout his writings he\nargues that education to produce undocile, unservile, creative\ncitizens is essential. Further, he views this capacity for\ncritical reflection as supported by democratic institutions and\nculture, since, at least in principle, these allow for openness,\nepistemic diversity, experiment, contestation and revision that\nsupports freedom as individuality (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 329; Ethics, 2nd\nedition, LW7, 358).\n\nDewey goes further still, though, in situating the free individual:\nfreedom doesn\u2019t only consist in the development\nof reflective individuality, which requires supportive social and\npolitical conditions. It also includes participation in a community\n(here tweaking an idea he found in Green and the New Liberals). As he\nputs it in The Public and Its Problems, liberty \u201cis\nthat secure release and fulfilment of personal potentialities which\ntake place only in rich and manifold association with others: the\npower to be an individualized self making a distinctive contribution\nand enjoying in its own way the fruits of association\u201d (The\nPublic and Its Problems, LW2, 329). You are free not\nonly in reflectively choosing among a set of options but in having\navailable a rich set of worthwhile options; without these options, you\naren\u2019t free, or as free, as someone who does enjoy a rich and\nmanifold association with others. You are also free only when you are\nmaking your own distinctive contribution to the society. Dewey is\nthe kind of positive liberty theorist for whom individual freedom is\nachieved through participation in the process through which the\nindividual\u2019s society exercises collective control over its own\naffairs. I\u2019ll return to this in the next section, since it\nshapes Dewey\u2019s conception of democracy.\n\nWhat should be underlined here is that this account of freedom is the\nbasis of a critical assessment of capitalist\nsociety: \u201c[t]he direct impact of liberty always has to do\nwith some class or group that is suffering in a special way from some\nform of constraint exercised by the distribution of powers that exists\nin contemporary society\u201d (Liberalism and Social\nAction, LW11, 38). Liberals agree that the state\nhas an important role in maintaining the conditions for individual\nfreedom. For Dewey, the character and value of freedom, as for\nthe Hegelian idealists and New Liberals on whom he drew and for later\nwriters on negative and positive liberty such as Isaiah Berlin, flowed\ninto a debate about the proper scope of social and political action.\nThe scope of legitimate social and political action had to be\ndetermined experimentally and in the light of the needs of his\nconception of freedom as individuality: laissez-faire should\nnot be assumed to be the default position for a liberal. For earlier\nliberalism, the opposition of the individual and government may have\nmade sense, in an era characterised by political despotism. In\ncircumstances of popular government and where there is a need to track\nand regulate the complexities of modern industrial conditions,\nhowever, the nostrums of laissez-faire liberalism only\nserve to provide ideological support for plutocracy. Dewey\ndrew on a wide range of sources to flesh out his conception of social\naction or social control, including the utopian Edward Bellamy and\nBritish guild socialist G. D. H. Cole, and argued for social\nreforms that tended to strengthen workers\u2019 rights, including\nrights to form and join unions, and to take strike action, and the\nextension of democratic control in the workplace, and a welfare\nstate, in the name of freedom as individuality. More\npointedly, Dewey argued, particularly in the 1930s, that a socialized\neconomy was necessary to maintain the liberal value of freedom.\nUnsurprisingly, this drew a hostile reception from advocates of a\nnegative concept of liberty such as F. A. Hayek (1960), who viewed\nDewey as profoundly destructive of liberalism.\n\nSince both positive liberty and the idea of social control have been\nthought to have worrying authoritarian implications, and Dewey is\nsometimes thought of as a technocrat, it is worth emphasising the\nliberal and democratic character of Dewey\u2019s conception of social\naction. Individuality as an ethical ideal requires that individuals\nfind their own way, and not have particular doctrines or social roles\nimposed on them: it is only \u201cwhen individuals have initiative,\nindependence of judgment, flexibility, fullness of experience can they\nact so as to enrich the lives of others\u201d (Ethics,\n2nd edition, LW7, 285). Dewey doesn\u2019t think\nthat the liberal rights protected in the name of individual liberty\n(such as freedoms of speech, thought, movement, and so on) should be\ndispensed with but rather that they are constitutive in part of the\npositive liberty he advocates. Indeed, he emphasises that\n\u201cdirect and violent encroachments on liberty of thought and\nspeech are perpetrated by police and by organized bands of persons\nwhen suggestions for important change in economic lines are put\nforth\u201d (Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7,\n360). Furthermore, viewing liberty through the prism of individuality\nonly opens up the possibility of political action in the name of\nliberty, but it does not itself require it. Finally, and in contrast\nto technocratic critics of laissez-faire such as Walter\nLippmann, as we will see, Dewey argues that an extensive form of\ndemocracy is essential for social action, and he vests little faith in\nexperts.\n3. Democratic Ideals and Realities\n\nWhile democracy is the key organising concept of Dewey\u2019s\npolitical philosophy, it is one that he thinks of in a very unusual\nway. As he puts it in Democracy and Education, it is\n\u201cmore than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of\nassociated living, of conjoint communicated experience\u201d\n(MW9, 93) or, famously, it is a \u201cway of life\u201d\n(Freedom and Culture, LW13, 155; \u201cCreative\nDemocracy: The Task Before Us\u201d, LW14, 226). This is a\nlong way from the conception of democracy as majority rule or as a set\nof procedures for the selection of governors.\n\nDewey views democracy as an ideal of associated life in the sense that\nas an ideal he thinks that it reconciles the full expression of\nindividual potentialities and the common good. In this sense, democracy\nsits at the apex of his historicised naturalist account of\nindividuality and community. \u201cFrom the standpoint of the\nindividual\u201d, as he puts it, democracy \u201cconsists in having\na responsible share according to capacity in forming and directing the\nactivities of the groups in which one belongs and in participating\naccording to need in the values which the groups sustain\u201d, while\n\u201cfrom the standpoint of the groups, it demands liberation of the\npotentialities of members of a group in harmony with the interests and\ngoods which are common\u201d (The Public and Its Problems,\nLW2, 327\u20138). In working out what to do, individuals and\ngroups are confronted by dilemmas. Some of us (such as a gang of\nthieves, in Dewey\u2019s example) address these problems in ways that\npromote certain kinds of growth and development (you can flourish as a\nthief, including feeling solidarity with your gang) but inherently\nfrustrate ourselves and our goals, since these set us on paths of\nactivity that necessarily generate conflict with other individuals and\ngroups, and so the need for coercion. It is only a democratic\ncommunity, Dewey believes, which allows each member fully to realize\nher potentialities without conflict and coercion, since it does not\ninherently generate conflict. Dewey is explicit that this ideal\ndescribes a problem that societies confront and a\ncritical ideal for them to attain, namely, how to harmonize the\ndevelopment of each individual with the maintenance of a society in\nwhich the individual activities will contribute to the common good\n(Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7, 350), rather\nthan the blueprint for an institutional solution. Dewey\u2019s point\nis that (unlike externally imposed moral standards) this ideal is\nimmanent to democratic societies, since what makes them democratic is\nthe extent to which they overcome the barriers (of class and race, for\nexample (Democracy and Education, MW9, 93)) to free\ninteraction. As critics point out, this does not furnish a reason for\nsomeone who lacks an interest in overcoming those barriers to do so.\nPerhaps, though, Dewey should not be viewed as striving to provide\nsuch a reason, at this very general level, beyond pointing out that\nthose who are antipathetic to other classes and races should not claim\nto be democrats.\n\nAn overlapping but not identical fashion in which democracy\nconstitutes a way of life for Dewey concerns his view of the scope of\ndemocracy: democracy does not only govern what we think of as politics\nor administration, in the normal sense. Dewey thinks that this narrow\nview misses out the importance of democracy for a much wider range of\nsocial institutions: it is \u201csuperficial\u201d to think that\n\u201cgovernment is located in Washington and Albany. There is\ngovernment in the family, in business, in the church, in every social\ngroup\u201d which regulates the behaviour of its members\n(\u201cDemocracy and Educational\nAdministration\u201d, LW11, 221). The scope of democracy, in\nthe sense of the range of institutions to which it applies, should not\nbe construed narrowly. If our individuality is shaped by the wide\nrange of institutions that make up our social habitat, as Dewey\nthinks, then the rules and norms governing these institutions are too\nimportant to us to be left to chance, dogma, tradition or inherited\nhierarchy. Power and domination are present in all these spheres of\nsocial life so restricting democratic scrutiny and control to a single\nsphere of social life would be a mistake. In The Public and Its\nProblems, Dewey gives the question of the scope of politics some\nsystematic thought and provides this account of the distinction\nbetween public and private:\n\nWhen the consequences of an action are confined, or are thought to be\nconfined mainly to the persons directly engaged in it, the transaction\nis a private one \u2026. Yet if it is found that the consequences\n\u2026 extend beyond [those] directly concerned \u2026 the act\nacquires a public capacity \u2026 The line between private and\npublic is to be drawn on the basis of the extent and scope of the\nconsequences of acts which are so important as to need control,\nwhether by inhibition or promotion. The public consists of all those\nwho are affected by the indirect consequences of transactions to such\nan extent that it is deemed necessary to have these consequences\nsystematically cared for.  (LW2, 244\u20136)\n\n\nWhat constitutes the public (and private) in particular cases is\nrelative to range of judgments about what counts as a consequence, who\nis concerned, and what is so important as to need control, and the\npublic is a concept we have to deploy these judgments. So this\nconception of the public/private distinction fits with his\nexperimentalism by leaving very open the content of these judgments.\nAs we saw in the discussion of liberalism, in part Dewey objects to\nclassical liberalism because he thinks it has an overly restrictive\nview of what constitutes a constraint on individual liberty, grounded\nin an ahistorical conception of the individual. If we really\ncollectively value individuality, Dewey thinks, we should think not\nonly about how to protect some sorts of act from regulation (so are\n\u201cprivate\u201d) but also about where we need to intervene and\nregulate in order to support individuality.\n\nFurther, \u201c[d]emocracy is only estimable through the changed\nconception of intelligence that forms modern science\u201d\n(\u201cIntelligence and Morals\u201d, MW4, 39); it is a\nkind of social embodiment of his conception of experimentalism.\n\u201cThe very heart of political democracy is adjudication of social\ndifferences by discussion and exchange of views\u201d, he writes in a\nlate essay. \u201cThis method provides a rough approximation to the\nmethod of effecting change by means of experimental inquiry and\ntest\u201d (\u201cChallenge to Liberal Thought\u201d,\nLW15, 273). Democracy is a method for identifying and solving\nthe common problems confronted by communities. Robust inquiry requires\nthat we must have access to all the available evidence and arguments.\nIf we want our inquiry to be successful, we should not prejudge its\noutcomes, by excluding sources of experience that allow us to explore\nand correct our hypotheses. By contrast,\n\n[e]very authoritarian scheme, \u2026 assumes that its value may be\nassessed by some prior principle, if not of family and birth or race\nand color or possession of material wealth, then by the position and\nrank the person occupies in the existing social scheme. The democratic\nfaith in equality is the faith that each individual shall have the\nchance and opportunity to contribute whatever he is capable of\ncontributing, and that the value of his contribution be decided by its\nplace and function in the organized total of similar contributions:\n\u2013 not on the basis of prior status of any kind whatever.\n(\u201cDemocracy and Educational Administration\u201d,\nLW11, 220)\n\n\nAlthough the \u201cdemocratic faith\u201d suggests that we are all\ncapable of meaningfully contributing to critical inquiry, the\ndevelopment of habits of intelligent conduct isn\u2019t taken for\ngranted: they can be degraded by social disempowerment, propaganda and\nideology. And, as we\u2019ve seen, they are in any case viewed as\nhard-won achievements of schooling and a generally supportive society.\nDemocratic societies are thought of as both seeking to attain\ndesirable goals, and arguing over how to do so, and also as arguing\nover what a desirable goal is. In other words, democratic politics is\na mode of activity in which we can arrive at a conception of what our\ninterests are. Accordingly, like recent deliberative democrats, Dewey\nascribes a central importance to discussion, consultation, persuasion\nand debate in democratic decision-making. As the experimentalist\nconception of inquiry insists, this does not imply that we need a\npriori criteria in order to establish if this process has been\nsuccessful. Rather, criteria for what counts as a satisfactory\nsolution may be hammered out in the process of searching for one.\nDemocracy is experimental for Dewey in that it allows, or should\nallow, a profound questioning of the id\u00e9es fixes of\nthe established order, even if, of course, much democratic politics\nwill not take the form of such questioning. Further, it is worth\nunderlining that Dewey does not conflate this kind of\ndeliberative politics with the elimination of social conflict, and so\nwith the critical ideal of democracy in his social ontology. He\ndoesn\u2019t imagine away differences of opinion, conflicts of\ninterest and value pluralism as ineliminable features of social and\npolitical life. Even where there is open public discussion,\n\u201c[d]ifferences of opinion in the sense of differences of\njudgment as to the course which it is best to follow, the policy which\nit is best to try out, will still exist\u201d (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 362). Democracy as public discussion is\nviewed as the best way of dealing with the conflict of interests in a\nsociety:\n\nThe method of democracy \u2013 inasfar as it is that of organized\nintelligence \u2013 is to bring these conflicts out into the open\nwhere their special claims can be discussed and judged in the light of\nmore inclusive interests than are represented by either of them\nseparately. (Liberalism and Social Action, LW11, 56)\n\n\nA concern with the epistemic costs and risks of social and political\nhierarchy runs through Dewey\u2019s work: such \u201csocial\ndivisions as interfere with free and full intercourse react to make\nintelligence and knowing of the separated classes one-sided\u201d\n(Democracy and Education, MW9, 354). It is not only\nthat some classes are excluded from cultural capital and education or\nsubjected to propaganda: \u201call special privilege narrows the\noutlook of those who possess it, as well as limits the possibilities\nof development of those not having it\u201d (Ethics,\n2nd edition, LW7, 347). Rationalization of your\nown superior position as well as wilful ignorance of others\u2019\nsituation are central epistemic vices of this kind of hierarchy. This\nanxiety about hierarchy underlies the response to Walter\nLippmann\u2019s influential sceptical attack on democratic theory in\nbooks such as Public Opinion (1922) and The Phantom\nPublic (1925). Lippmann (who like Dewey was influenced by William\nJames and who shared many philosophical and political commitments with\nDewey at an earlier stage of his career) agrees that contemporary\nmoral and political thinking has not caught up with the modern world.\nUnlike Dewey, however, Lippmann thinks that understanding the\ncomplexity and opacity of modern societies requires us to set aside\nthe illusion entertained by classical democratic theorists that\ncitizens are \u201comnicompetent\u201d, capable of arriving at\ninformed judgments about politics, and instead embrace the legitimacy\nof decision-making by qualified experts. The force of this critique of\ndemocracy for Dewey in part derives from its deployment of his own\nintellectual strategy for ends with which he vehemently disagrees. In\nthis context, although Dewey can sometimes appear to sound dismissive\nabout what he calls the \u201cpolitical machinery\u201d of democracy\nsuch as the vote and majority rule, he never regards this as\ninessential or disposable. At the minimum, for Dewey, this machinery\nhelps to protect individuals from putative experts about where the\ninterests of people lie. Dewey\u2019s response to this is to point\nout that experts have their own biases, and need correction from those\nwho have to live with the consequences of their decisions: \u201cin\nthe absence of an articulate voice on the part of the masses, the best\ndo not remain the best, the wise cease to be wise \u2026. In the\ndegree to which they become a specialized class, they are shut off\nfrom knowledge of the needs they are supposed to serve\u201d. So the\nmerit of even existing \u201crudimentary\u201d forms of democracy is\nthat they compel \u201crecourse to methods of discussion,\nconsultation and persuasion\u201d and in so doing provide the\nopportunity to improve decisions (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 364; cf. Reconstruction in\nPhilosophy, MW12, 164). Taken in isolation, this way of\nviewing the desirability of democratic political machinery seems\ninstrumental and minimal; instrumental, in that the desirability of\ndemocracy derives from its protecting the interests of each individual\nagainst the depredations of an elite class, and minimal, in that the\nrationale for popular participation is limited to the need to keep the\nelite informed about where the shoe pinches, if its policies are not\nto be misguided. In spite of his scathing tone, Dewey is committed to\nimproving this machinery (by supporting the equal distribution of the\nfranchise, for example) rather than merely dismissing it as\nunimportant. The real target of his ire is the exclusive\nidentification of democracy with a particular current set of political\ninstitutions, particularly only with elections and majority rule. As\nin the case of the defunct idea of liberalism, Dewey thinks of this as\na once liberating conception that now contains an inbuilt conservative\nbias that prevents us from seeing the relevance of democracy to wider\nsocial terrain, such as the workplace, and constrains more imaginative\ninstitutional thinking.\n4. Legacies\n\nDewey\u2019s obituarists eulogized him as the authoritative American\nphilosopher of democracy. Both during his life and subsequently,\nhowever, he has been a more controversial figure than this reputation\nwould suggest. In part, this reflects his profile and fecundity.\nPrecisely because he ranged so prominently across such a wide\nintellectual terrain, Dewey has been a point of reference and target\nfor commentators in all the fields he explored: his educational\nwritings in particular became a default fons et origo of the\nalleged ills ascribed to schemes of progressive education by their\ncritics. Further, across a long and active career as a public\nintellectual, Dewey adopted bold and controversial political positions\non deeply divisive issues, including (for example) robustly supporting\nUS entry into the First World War and later opposing intervention in\nthe Second World War, which also attracted fierce opprobrium as well\nas support.\n\nDewey\u2019s pragmatism was always highly contentious. A dominant\nview for much of the twentieth century, expounded by such diverse\nvoices as Lewis Mumford (1926), Louis Hartz (1955), Bernard Crick\n(1959), Max Horkheimer (1974), Herbert Marcuse (2011), John Diggins\n(1994), and Sheldon Wolin (2004), was that pragmatism is a philosophy\nfor liberal technocrats, an account of how to think flexibly about the\nachievement of socially endorsed parochial goals but with few\nresources to think critically about those goals. For others, including\nBertrand Russell and William Elliott, its apparent laxity about\nobjectivity made it susceptible to capture by darker forces, such as\nfascism (a point some fascists were happy to accept). To skeptics in\ndemocratic theory, following in the tracks of Lippmann and other of\nDewey\u2019s contemporaries such as Reinhold Niebuhr (1960),\nDewey\u2019s radical and unconventional idea of democracy is\nextravagantly optimistic about the epistemic capacities of the\nindividual citizen and of democratic institutions. By the\nmid-twentieth century his views had to some extent staled in the face\nof stimulating new research programmes, such as logical empiricism,\nthe Frankfurt School, existentialism, and other approaches. And the\nkey intellectual antagonist of much of Dewey\u2019s political\nwriting, laissez-faire liberalism, occupied a relatively\nmarginal space.\n\nThe philosopher who probably did the most singlehandedly to promote\nthe recrudescence of interest in Dewey\u2019s thinking after this\nperiod of relative marginality, Richard Rorty, found in his work an\nhistorically-minded questioning of epistemological foundations and\naspirations to a God\u2019s-eye point of view that of course provided\nfodder for Rorty\u2019s own project. Yet, in relation to political\nphilosophy, Rorty\u2019s skeptical postmodern liberal ironism glossed\nover the detailed architecture of Dewey\u2019s ethical and political\ntheory, and made very little either of Dewey\u2019s own naturalistic\nconfidence in the mutually supportive or his conception of the\nprogressive character of scientific method and democracy. Even among\nthose philosophers who have been keen to draw on the pragmatist\ntradition as a resource for more positively elaborating a political\ntheory than Rorty was inclined to there are important figures, such as\nCheryl Misak (2000, 2013), who seek foundations for their view\nelsewhere, notably in Peirce\u2019s view of the precondition of\nbelief, and express doubts about what they see as Dewey\u2019s less\nclearly grounded ethical commitments. However, others such as Hilary\nand Ruth Anna Putnam (2017) and Philip Kitcher (2020, 2021) more\nwholeheartedly identify with, and try to develop, the commitments of\nDewey\u2019s pragmatic naturalism, in thinking through the\nrelationship between scientific inquiry, ethics and democracy. In\npart, recent increased engagement with Dewey\u2019s political\nphilosophy from philosophers across a range of traditions, including\nepistemic democrats, such as Elizabeth Anderson (2006), and Frankfurt\nSchool critical theorists, such as Axel Honneth (1998, 2008, 2014) and\nRahel Jaeggi (2018), flows from an interest in developing a fuller\nunderstanding of democracy as a method of social learning. In the\nteeth of the neoliberal revival of laissez-faire\nliberalism, many of these authors, and others, have mined his work\nas a resource for contemporary thinking about liberal socialism\nand participatory democracy (Medearis 2015, Jackson 2018).\nDewey\u2019s political philosophy remains an important reference\npoint and source of inspiration for thinkers who seek to explore and\ndevelop radical forms of democratic liberalism.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Dewey", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Dewey": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>The Early Works, 1882\u20131898</em>, 5 volumes, ed. by JoAnn\nBoydston, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1969\u20131975\n(abbreviated here <em>EW</em>, followed by volume number).", "<em>The Middle Works, 1899\u20131924</em>, 15 volumes, ed. by JoAnn\nBoydston, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1976\u20131983\n(abbreviated here <em>MW</em>, followed by volume number).", "<em>The Later Works</em>, 17 volumes, ed. by JoAnn Boydston,\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1981\u20131990 (abbreviated\nhere as <em>LW</em>, followed by volume number).", "Debra Morris and Ian Shapiro (eds.), <em>John Dewey: The Political\nWritings</em>, Indianapolis: Hackett, 1993.", "Larry Hickman and Thomas Alexander (eds.), <em>The Essential\nDewey</em> (two volumes), Bloomington: Indiana University Press,\n1999.\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"SecoLite\">"], "Secondary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Anderson, Elizabeth, 2006, \u201cThe Epistemology of\nDemocracy\u201d, <em>Episteme</em>, 3: 8\u201322.", "Bernstein, Richard J., 1971, <em>Praxis and Action</em>,\nPhiladelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2010, <em>The Pragmatic Turn</em>,\nCambridge: Polity Press.", "Bohman, James, 1999, \u201cDemocracy as Inquiry, Inquiry as\nDemocratic: Pragmatism, Social Science and the Democratic Division of\nLabor\u201d, <em>American Journal of Political Science</em>, 43:\n590\u2013607.", "Bourne, Randolph, 1977, <em>The Radical Will: Selected Writings,\n1911\u20131918</em>, Olaf Hansen (ed.), New York: Urizen.", "Caspary, William R., 2000, <em>Dewey on Democracy</em>, Ithaca:\nCornell University Press.", "Cochran, Molly, 2010, <em>The Cambridge Companion to Dewey</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Crick, Bernard, 1959, <em>The American Science of Politics</em>,\nBerkeley: University of California Press.", "Commager, Henry Steele, 1950, <em>The American Mind</em>, New\nHaven: Yale University Press.", "Damico, Alfonso, 1978, <em>Individuality and Community: The Social\nand Political Thought of John Dewey</em>, Gainesville: University\nPresses of Florida.", "Dieleman, Susan, David Rondel, and Christopher Voparil (eds.),\n2017, <em>Pragmatism and Justice</em>, New York: Oxford University\nPress.", "Diggins, John P., 1994, <em>The Promise of Pragmatism: Modernism\nand the Crisis of Knowledge and Authority</em>, Chicago: University of\nChicago Press.", "Farr, James, 1999, \u201cJohn Dewey and American Political\nScience\u201d, <em>American Journal of Political Science</em>, 43:\n520\u2013541.", "Fesmire, Steven, 2003, <em>John Dewey and Moral Imagination</em>,\nBloomington: Indiana University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2015, <em>Dewey</em>, Abingdon:\nRoutledge.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 (ed.), 2019, <em>The Oxford Handbook of\nDewey</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Festenstein, Matthew, 1997, <em>Pragmatism and Political Theory:\nFrom Dewey to Rorty</em>, Chicago: Chicago University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2001, \u201cInquiry as Critique: On the\nLegacy of Deweyan Pragmatism for Political Theory\u201d,\n<em>Political Studies</em>, 49: 730\u201348.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2008, \u201cJohn Dewey: Inquiry, Ethics\nand Democracy\u201d, in Cheryl Misak (ed.), <em>The Oxford Handbook\nof American Philosophy</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.\n87\u2013109.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, \u201cIdeal and Actual in\nDewey\u2019s Political Thought\u201d, in Dieleman, Rondel, and\nVoparil (eds.) 2017, pp. 97\u2013114.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2019, \u201cDoes Dewey Have an\n\u2018Epistemic Argument\u2019 for Democracy?\u201d,\n<em>Contemporary Pragmatism</em>, 16: 217\u201341.", "Festl, Michael G.
