Between object realism and mathematical platonism\n\nObject realism says there exist abstract mathematical objects, whereas\nplatonism adds Independence, which says that\nmathematical objects are independent of intelligent agents and their\nlanguage, thought, and practices. This final section surveys some\nlightweight forms of object realism that stop short of full-fledged\nplatonism. Such intermediate views are attracting an increasing amount\nof interest. \n4.1 How To Understand Independence\n\nA natural gloss on Independence is the following\ncounterfactual conditional: \n\nCounterfactual Independence.\nHad there not been any intelligent agents, or had their language,\nthought, or practices been suitably different, there would still have\nbeen mathematical objects.\n\n\nThis counterfactual conditional is accepted by most analytic\nphilosophers. To see why, consider the role that mathematics plays in\nour reasoning. We often reason about scenarios that aren\u2019t\nactual. Were we to build a bridge across this canyon, say, how strong\nwould it have to be to withstand the powerful gusts of wind? Sadly,\nthe previous bridge collapsed. Would it have done so had the steel\ngirders been twice as thick? This form of reasoning about\ncounterfactual scenarios is indispensable both to our everyday\ndeliberations and to science. The permissibility of such reasoning has\nan important consequence. Since the truths of pure mathematics can\nfreely be appealed to throughout our counterfactual reasoning, it\nfollows that these truths are counterfactually independent of us\nhumans, and all other intelligent life for that matter. That is, had\nbeen there been no intelligent life, these truths would still have\nremained the same. \n\nPure mathematics is in this respect very different from ordinary\nempirical truths. Had intelligent life never existed, this article\nwould not have been written. More interestingly, pure mathematics also\ncontrasts with various social conventions and constructions, with\nwhich it is sometimes compared (Hersh 1997, Feferman 2009, Cole 2013).\nHad intelligent life never existed, there would have been no laws,\ncontracts, or marriages\u2014yet the mathematical truths would have\nremained the same. \n\nThus, if Independence is understood merely as\ncounterfactual independence, then anyone who accepts object realism\nshould also accept platonism. \n\nIt is doubtful, however, that this understanding of\nIndependence fully captures the intended content of\nthe thesis. For Independence is meant to substantiate\nan analogy between mathematical objects and ordinary physical objects.\nJust as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so do numbers\nand sets. And just as statements about electrons and planets are made\ntrue or false by the objects with which they are concerned and these\nobjects\u2019 perfectly objective properties, so are statements about\nnumbers and sets. (See the quotes from Dummett 1978b and Maddy 1990 in\n the supplement.)\n In short, we have the following thesis: \n\nRobust Independence.\n\nMathematical objects are metaphysically on a par with ordinary\nphysical objects.\n\nLet us now consider some views that reject the stronger thesis of\nRobust Independence. These views are thus lightweight forms of object\nrealism, which stop short of full-blown platonism. \n4.2 Plenitudious platonism\n\nOne lightweight form of object realism is the \u201cfull-blooded\nplatonism\u201d of Balaguer 1998. This view is characterized by a\nplenitude principle to the effect that any mathematical\nobjects that could exist actually do exist. For instance, since the\nContinuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axiomatization of\nset theory, there is a universe of sets in which the hypothesis is\ntrue and another in which it is false. And neither universe is\nmetaphysically privileged (Hamkins 2012). By contrast, traditional\nplatonism asserts that there is a unique universe of sets in which the\nContinuum Hypothesis is either determinately true or determinately\n false.[15]\n\nOne alleged benefit of this plenitudinous view is in the epistemology\nof mathematics. If every consistent mathematical theory is true of\nsome universe of mathematical objects, then mathematical knowledge\nwill, in some sense, be easy to obtain: provided that our mathematical\ntheories are consistent, they are guaranteed to be true of some\nuniverse of mathematical objects.\n\nHowever, \u201cfull-blooded platonism\u201d has received much\ncriticism. Colyvan and Zalta 1999 criticize it for undermining the\npossibility of reference to mathematical objects, and Restall 2003,\nfor lacking a precise and coherent formulation of the plenitude\nprinciple on which the view is based. Martin (2001) proposes that\ndifferent universes of sets be amalgamated to yield a single maximal\nuniverse, which will be privileged by fitting our conception of set\nbetter than any other universe of sets.\n\nA different version of plenitudinous platonism is developed in Linsky\n& Zalta 1995 and a series of further articles. (See, for instance,\nLinsky & Zalta 2006 and other articles cited therein.) Traditional\nplatonism goes wrong by \u201cconceiv[ing] of abstract objects on the\nmodel of physical objects\u201d (Linsky & Zalta 1995, p. 533),\nincluding in particular the idea that such objects are\n\u201csparse\u201d rather than plenitudinous. Linsky & Zalta\ndevelop an alternative approach on the basis of the second\nauthor\u2019s \u201cobject theory\u201d. The main feature of object\ntheory is a very general comprehension principle which asserts the\nexistence of a plenitude of abstract objects: for any collection of\nproperties, there is an abstract object which \u201cencodes\u201d\nprecisely these properties. In object theory, moreover, two abstract\nobjects are identical just in case they encode precisely the same\nproperties. Object theory\u2019s comprehension principle and identity\ncriterion are said to \u201cprovide the link between our cognitive\nfaculty of understanding and abstract objects\u201d (ibid.,\np. 547). (See Ebert & Rossberg 2007 for critical discussion.)\n4.3 Lightweight semantic values\n\nAssume that object realism is true. For convenience, assume also\nClassical Semantics. These assumptions ensure that\nthe singular terms and quantifiers of mathematical language refer to\nand range over abstract objects. Given these assumptions, should one\nalso be a mathematical platonist? In other words, do the objects that\nmathematical sentences refer to and quantify over satisfy either\nversion of the independence thesis?\n\nIt will be useful to restate our assumptions in more neutral terms. We\ncan do this by invoking the notion of a semantic value, which\nplays an important role in semantics and the philosophy of language.\nIn these fields it is widely assumed that each expression makes some\ndefinite contribution to the truth-value of sentences in which the\nexpression occurs. This contribution is known as the semantic\nvalue of the expression. It is widely assumed that (at least in\nextensional contexts) the semantic value of a singular term is just\nits referent.\n\nOur assumptions can now be stated neutrally as the claim that\nmathematical singular terms have abstract semantic values and that its\nquantifiers range over the kinds of item that serve as semantic\nvalues. Let\u2019s focus on the claim about singular terms. What is\nthe philosophical significance of this claim? In particular, does it\nsupport some version of Independence? The answer will\ndepend on what is required for a mathematical singular term to have a\nsemantic value.\n\nSome philosophers argue that not very much is required (Frege 1953,\nDummett 1981, Dummett 1991a, Wright 1983, Hale & Wright 2000, Rayo\n2013, and Linnebo 2012 and 2018). It suffices for the term \\(t\\) to\nmake some definite contribution to the truth-values of sentences in\nwhich it occurs. The whole purpose of the notion of a semantic value\nwas to represent such contributions. It therefore suffices for a\nsingular term to possess a semantic value that it makes some such\nsuitable contribution.\n\nThis may even open the way for a form of non-eliminative reductionism\nabout mathematical objects (Dummett 1991a, Linnebo 2018). Although it\nis perfectly true that the mathematical singular term \\(t\\) has an\nabstract object as its semantic value, this truth may obtain in virtue\nof more basic facts which do not mention or involve the relevant\nabstract object. For example, a singular term may refer to a direction\nin virtue of being associated with an appropriately oriented line and\nsubject to the criterion of identity stating that two lines specify\none and the same direction just in case they are parallel. Thus,\nalthough it is perfectly true that the term refers to an abstract\nobject, this truth obtains in virtue of some more basic facts that do\nnot mention or involve that abstract object. Linnebo (2018, ch. 11)\nargues that this approach to mathematical objects nevertheless\nvalidates Counterfactual Independence.\n\nThere is no reason, however, why an approach of this sort should be\ncommitted to Robust Independence. On the contrary, such approaches\nentail some important disanalogies between mathematical and physical\nobjects. For a direction to exist, for example, it suffices that there\nexists an appropriate oriented line that specifies that the direction.\nSince this line can be located anywhere, the existence of the\ndirection does not impose any constraints on any particular region of\nspacetime. By contrast, the existence of a physical object imposes\nsubstantial constraints on the particular region of spacetime where\nthe object is located. \n\nIn short, if some lightweight account of semantic values is\ndefensible, we can accept object realism and Counterfactual\nIndependence without committing ourselves to a more robust\nform of platonism.\n4.4 Inspiration from Aristotle\n\nWe conclude by describing two further examples of lightweight forms of\nobject realism that reject the platonistic analogy between\nmathematical objects and ordinary physical objects. Both examples are\ninspired by Aristotle.\n\nFirst, perhaps mathematical objects exist only in a potential manner,\nwhich contrasts with the actual mode of existence of ordinary physical\nobjects. This idea is at the heart of the ancient notion of potential\ninfinity (Lear 1980, Linnebo & Shapiro 2019). According to\nAristotle, the natural numbers are potentially infinite in\nthe sense that, however large a number we have produced (by\ninstantiating it in the physical world), it is possible to produce an\neven larger number. But Aristotle denies that the natural numbers are\nactually infinite: this would require the physical world to\nbe infinite, which he argues is impossible. \n\nFollowing Cantor, most mathematicians and philosophers now defend the\nactual infinity of the natural numbers. This is made possible in part\nby denying the Aristotelian requirement that every number needs to be\ninstantiated in the physical world. When this is denied, the actual\ninfinity of the natural numbers no longer entails the actual infinity\nof the physical world. \n\nHowever, a form of potentialism about the hierarchy of sets continues\nto enjoy considerable support, especially in connection with the\niterative conception of sets (Parsons 1977, Jan\u00e9 2010, Linnebo\n2013, Studd 2013). No matter how many sets have been formed, it is\npossible to form even more. If true, this would mean that sets have a\npotential form of existence which distinguishes them sharply from\nordinary physical\n objects.[16]\n\n\nSecond, perhaps mathematical objects are ontologically dependent or\nderivative in a way that distinguishes them from independently\nexisting physical objects. According to what Rosen (2011) calls\n\u201cqualified realism\u201d, mathematical facts are grounded in\nother facts that do not involve mathematical objects. For example, the\nnatural numbers exist, but their existence and their properties and\nrelations are grounded in facts more fundamental than the arithmetical\nones, e.g., in facts about provability or about structural\npossibilities. The view can also be given a more Aristotelian spin by\ntaking simple arithmetical truths to be grounded in facts about\nappropriately numerous pluralities that instantiate the relevant\nnumbers (Schwartzkopff 2011, Donaldson 2017). For example, \\(2+2=4\\)\nis grounded in any fact about a pair and a disjoint pair making a\nquadruple. There are other versions of the view as well. For example,\nKit Fine (1995) and others argue that a set is ontologically dependent\non its elements. (This view is also closely related to the\nset-theoretic potentialism mentioned above.) ",
