    "main_text": "Dilemmas and Consistency\n4. Dilemmas and Consistency\n\nWe shall return to the issue of whether it is possible to preclude\ngenuine moral dilemmas. But what about the desirability of doing so?\nWhy have ethicists thought that their theories should preclude the\npossibility of dilemmas? At the intuitive level, the existence of\nmoral dilemmas suggests some sort of inconsistency. An agent caught in\na genuine dilemma is required to do each of two acts but cannot do\nboth. And since he cannot do both, not doing one is a condition of\ndoing the other. Thus, it seems that the same act is both required and\nforbidden. But exposing a logical inconsistency takes some work; for\ninitial inspection reveals that the inconsistency intuitively felt is\nnot present. Allowing \\(OA\\) to designate that the agent in question\nought to do \\(A\\) (or is morally obligated to do \\(A\\), or is morally\nrequired to do \\(A)\\), that \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are both true is not\nitself inconsistent, even if one adds that it is not possible for the\nagent to do both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). And even if the situation is\nappropriately described as \\(OA\\) and \\(O\\neg A\\), that is not a\ncontradiction; the contradictory of \\(OA\\) is \\(\\neg OA\\). (See Marcus\n1980 and McConnell 1978, 273.)\n\nSimilarly rules that generate moral dilemmas are not inconsistent, at\nleast on the usual understanding of that term. Ruth Marcus suggests\nplausibly that we \u201cdefine a set of rules as consistent if there\nis some possible world in which they are all obeyable in all\ncircumstances in that world.\u201d Thus, \u201crules are\nconsistent if there are possible circumstances in which no conflict\nwill emerge,\u201d and \u201ca set of rules is inconsistent if there\nare no circumstances, no possible world, in which all the\nrules are satisfiable\u201d (Marcus 1980, 128 and 129). Kant, Mill,\nand Ross were likely aware that a dilemma-generating theory need not\nbe inconsistent. Even so, they would be disturbed if their own\ntheories allowed for such predicaments. If this speculation is\ncorrect, it suggests that Kant, Mill, Ross, and others thought that\nthere is an important theoretical feature that dilemma-generating\ntheories lack. And this is understandable. It is certainly no comfort\nto an agent facing a reputed moral dilemma to be told that at least\nthe rules which generate this predicament are consistent because there\nis a possible world in which they do not conflict. For a good\npractical example, consider the situation of the criminal defense\nattorney. She is said to have an obligation to hold in confidence the\ndisclosures made by a client and to be required to conduct herself\nwith candor before the court (where the latter requires that the\nattorney inform the court when her client commits perjury) (Freedman\n1975, Chapter 3). It is clear that in this world these two obligations\noften conflict. It is equally clear that in some possible\nworld\u2014for example, one in which clients do not commit\nperjury\u2014that both obligations can be satisfied. Knowing this is\nof no assistance to defense attorneys who face a conflict between\nthese two requirements in this world.\n\nEthicists who are concerned that their theories not allow for moral\ndilemmas have more than consistency in mind. What is troubling is that\ntheories that allow for dilemmas fail to be uniquely\naction-guiding. A theory is appropriately action-guiding if it\nassesses an agent\u2019s options as either forbidden, (merely) permissible,\nor obligatory (or, possibly, supererogatory). If more than one action\nis right, then the agent\u2019s obligation is to do any one of the right\nacts. A theory can fail to be uniquely action-guiding in either of two\nways: by recommending incompatible actions in a situation or by not\nrecommending any action at all. Theories that generate genuine moral\ndilemmas fail to be uniquely action-guiding in the former way.\nTheories that have no way, even in principle, of determining what an\nagent should do in a particular situation have what Thomas E. Hill,\nJr. calls \u201cgaps\u201d (Hill 1996, 179\u2013183); they fail to\nbe action-guiding in the latter way. Since one of the main points of\nmoral theories is to provide agents with guidance, that suggests that\nit is desirable for theories to eliminate dilemmas and gaps, at least\nif doing so is possible.\n\nBut failing to be uniquely action-guiding is not the only reason that\nthe existence of moral dilemmas is thought to be troublesome. Just as\nimportant, the existence of dilemmas does lead to inconsistencies if\ncertain other widely held theses are true. Here we shall consider two\ndifferent arguments, each of which shows that one cannot consistently\nacknowledge the reality of moral dilemmas while holding selected (and\nseemingly plausible) principles.\n\nThe first argument shows that two standard principles of deontic logic\nare, when conjoined, incompatible with the existence of moral\ndilemmas. The first of these is the principle of deontic\nconsistency \n\\[\\tag{PC}\nOA \\rightarrow \\neg O\\neg A.\n\\]\n\n\nIntuitively this principle just says that the same action cannot be\nboth obligatory and forbidden. Note that as initially described, the\nexistence of dilemmas does not conflict with PC. For as described,\ndilemmas involve a situation in which an agent ought to do \\(A\\),\nought to do \\(B\\), but cannot do both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But if we add a\nprinciple of deontic logic, then we obtain a conflict with\nPC: \n\\[\\tag{PD}\n\\Box(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(OA \\rightarrow OB).\n\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, PD just says that if doing \\(A\\) brings about \\(B\\), and\nif \\(A\\) is obligatory (morally required), then \\(B\\) is obligatory\n(morally required). The first argument that generates\ninconsistency can now be stated. Premises (1), (2), and (3) represent\nthe claim that moral dilemmas exist. \n\n\n1.\n\\(OA\\)\n\n\n2.\n\\(OB\\)\n\n\n3.\n\\(\\neg C (A \\amp B)\\)\n[where \u2018\\(\\neg C\\)\u2019 means\n\u2018cannot\u2019]\n\n4.\n\\(\\Box(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(OA \\rightarrow OB)\\)\n[where \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 means physical\nnecessity]\n\n5.\n\\(\\Box \\neg(B \\amp A)\\)\n(from 3)\n\n6.\n\\(\\Box(B \\rightarrow \\neg A)\\)\n(from 5)\n\n7.\n\\(\\Box(B \\rightarrow \\neg A) \\rightarrow(OB \\rightarrow O\\neg\nA)\\)\n(an instantiation of 4)\n\n8.\n\\(OB \\rightarrow O\\neg A\\)\n(from 6 and 7)\n\n9.\n\\(O\\neg A\\)\n(from 2 and 8)\n\n10.\n\\(OA \\text{ and } O\\neg A\\)\n(from 1 and 9)\n\n\nLine (10) directly conflicts with PC. And from PC and (1), we can\nconclude:\n\n\n11.\n\\(\\neg O\\neg A\\)\n\n\nAnd, of course, (9) and (11) are contradictory. So if we assume PC and\nPD, then the existence of dilemmas generates an inconsistency of the\nold-fashioned logical sort. (Note: In standard deontic logic, the\n\u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 in PD typically designates logical necessity.\nHere I take it to indicate physical necessity so that the appropriate\nconnection with premise (3) can be made. And I take it that logical\nnecessity is stronger than physical necessity.)\n\nTwo other principles accepted in most systems of deontic logic entail\nPC. So if PD holds, then one of these additional two principles must\nbe jettisoned too. The first says that if an action is obligatory, it\nis also permissible. The second says that an action is permissible if\nand only if it is not forbidden. These principles may be stated\nas: \n\\[\\tag{OP}\nOA \\rightarrow PA;\n\\]\n\n\nand  \n\\[\\tag{D}\nPA \\leftrightarrow \\neg O\\neg A.\n\\]\n\n\nPrinciples OP and D are basic; they seem to be conceptual truths\n(Brink 1994, section IV). From these two principles, one can deduce\nPC, which gives it additional support.\n\nThe second argument that generates inconsistency, like the\nfirst, has as its first three premises a symbolic representation of a\nmoral dilemma.\n\n\n1.\n\\(OA\\)\n\n2.\n\\(OB\\)\n\n3.\n\\(\\neg C (A \\amp B)\\)\n\n\nAnd like the first, this second argument shows that the existence of\ndilemmas leads to a contradiction if we assume two other commonly\naccepted principles. The first of these principles is that\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019. Intuitively this says\nthat if an agent is morally required to do an action, it must be\nwithin the agent\u2019s power to do it. This principle seems necessary if\nmoral judgments are to be uniquely action-guiding. We may represent\nthis as\n\n\n4.\n\\(OA \\rightarrow CA\\)\n(for all \\(A\\))\n\n\nThe other principle, endorsed by most systems of deontic logic, says\nthat if an agent is required to do each of two actions, she is\nrequired to do both. We may represent this as \n\n\n5.\n\\((OA \\amp OB) \\rightarrow O(A\\amp B)\\)\n(for all \\(A\\) and all \\(B\\))\n\n\nThe argument then proceeds: \n\n\n6.\n\\(O(A \\amp B) \\rightarrow C(A \\amp B)\\)\n(an instance of 4)\n\n7.\n\\(OA \\amp OB\\)\n(from 1 and 2)\n\n8.\n\\(O(A \\amp B)\\)\n(from 5 and 7)\n\n9.\n\\(\\neg O(A \\amp B)\\)\n(from 3 and 6)\n\n\nSo if one assumes that \u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019\nand if one assumes the principle represented in (5)\u2014dubbed by\nsome the agglomeration principle (Williams 1965)\u2014then again a\ncontradiction can be derived.\n",
