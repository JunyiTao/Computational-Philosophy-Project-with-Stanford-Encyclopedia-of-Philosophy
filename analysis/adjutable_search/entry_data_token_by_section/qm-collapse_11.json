    "main_text": "The Problem of the Tails of the Wave Function\n12. The Problem of the Tails of the Wave Function\n\nThere has been a lively debate around a problem which has its origin,\naccording to some of the authors which have raised it, in the fact\nthat even though the localization process which corresponds to\nmultiplying the wave function times a Gaussian, thus leading to wave\nfunctions strongly peaked around the position of the hitting, they\nallow nevertheless the final wavefuntion to be different from zero\nover the whole space. The first criticism of this kind was raised by\nA. Shimony (1990) and can be summarized by his sentence,\n\n\n[one should not] tolerate\u201ctails\u201d which are so broad that\ndifferent parts [...] can be discriminated by the senses, even if very\nlow probability amplitude is assigned to the tail (1990: 53)\n\n\n\nAfter a localization of a macroscopic system, typically the pointer of\nthe apparatus, its centre of mass will be associated to a wave\nfunction which is different from zero over the whole space. If one\nadopts the probabilistic interpretation of the standard theory, this\nmeans that even when the measurement process is over, there is a\nnonzero (even though extremely small) probability of finding its\npointer in an arbitrary position, instead of the one corresponding to\nthe registered outcome. This is taken as unacceptable, as indicating\nthat the DRP does not actually overcome the macro-objectification\nproblem.\n\nLet us state immediately that the (alleged) problem arises entirely\nfrom keeping the standard interpretation of the wave function\nunchanged, in particular assuming that its squared modulus gives the\nprobability density of the position variable. However, as we have\ndiscussed in the previous section, there are much more serious reasons\nof principle which require to abandon the probabilistic interpretation\nand replace it either with the \u2018flash ontology\u2019, or with\nthe \u2018 mass density ontology\u2019 which we have discussed\nabove.\n\nBefore entering into a detailed discussion of this subtle point we\nneed to focus the problem better. Suppose one adopts, for the moment,\nthe conventional quantum position. We agree that, within such a\nframework, the fact that wave functions never have strictly compact\nspatial support can be considered puzzling. However this is an\nunavoidable problem arising directly from the mathematical features\n(spreading of wave functions) and from the probabilistic\ninterpretation of the theory, and not at all a problem peculiar to\ndynamical reduction models. Indeed, the fact that, e.g., the wave\nfunction of the center of mass of a pointer or of a table has not a\ncompact support has never been taken to be a problem for standard\nquantum mechanics. When, e.g., the center of mass of a table is\nextremely well peaked around a given point in space, it has always\nbeen accepted that it describes a table located at some position, and\nthat this corresponds in some way to our perception of it. It is\nobviously true that, for the given wave function, the quantum rules\nentail that if a measurement were performed the table could be found\n(with an extremely small probability) to be kilometers far away, but\nthis is not the measurement or the macro-objectification\nproblem of the standard theory. The latter concerns a completely\ndifferent situation, i.e., that in which one is confronted with a\nsuperposition with comparable weights of two macroscopically separated\nwave functions, both of which possess tails (i.e., have non-compact\nsupport) but are appreciably different from zero only in far-away\nnarrow intervals. This is the really embarrassing situation which\nconventional quantum mechanics is unable to make understandable. To\nwhich perception of the position of the pointer (of the table) does\nthis wave function correspond?\n\nWithin GRW, the superposition of two states which, when considered\nindividually, are assumed to lead to different and definite\nperceptions of macroscopic locations, are dynamically forbidden. If\nsome process tends to produce such superpositions, then the reducing\ndynamics induces the localization of the centre of mass (the\nassociated wave function being appreciably different from zero only in\na narrow and precise interval). Correspondingly, the possibility\narises of attributing to the system the property of being in a\ndefinite place and thus of accounting for our definite perception of\nit. Summarizing, we stress once more that the criticism about the\ntails as well as the requirement that the appearance of\nmacroscopically extended (even though extremely small) tails be\nstrictly forbidden is exclusively motivated by uncritically committing\noneself to the probabilistic interpretation of the theory, even for\nwhat concerns the psycho-physical correspondence: when this position\nis taken, states assigning non-exactly vanishing probabilities to\ndifferent outcomes of position measurements should correspond to\nambiguous perceptions about these positions. Since neither within the\nstandard formalism nor within the framework of dynamical reduction\nmodels a wave function can have compact support, taking such a\nposition leads to conclude that it is just the linear character of the\nHilbert space description of physical systems which has to be given\nup.\n\nIt ought to be stressed that there is nothing in the GRW theory which\nforbids or makes problematic to assume that the localization function\nhas compact support, but it also has to be noted that following this\nline would be totally useless: since the evolution equation contains\nthe kinetic energy term, any function, even if it has compact support\nat a given time, will instantaneously spread, acquiring a tail\nextending over the whole space. If one sticks to the probabilistic\ninterpretation and one accepts the completeness of the description of\nthe states of physical systems in terms of the wave function, the tail\nproblem cannot be avoided.\n\nThe solution to the tails problem can only derive from abandoning\ncompletely the probabilistic interpretation and from adopting a more\nphysical and realistic interpretation relating \u2018what is out\nthere\u2019 to, e.g., the mass density distribution over the whole\nuniverse. In this connection, the following example will be\ninstructive. Take a massive sphere of normal density and mass of about\n1 kg. Classically, the mass of this body would be totally concentrated\nwithin the radius of the sphere, call it \\(r\\). In QMSL, after the\nextremely short time interval in which the collapse dynamics leads to\na \u2018regime\u2019 situation, and if one considers a sphere with\nradius \\(r + 10^{-5}\\) cm, the integral of the mass density over the\nrest of space turns out to be an incredibly small fraction (of the\norder of 1 over 10 to the power \\(10^{15})\\) of the mass of a single\nproton. In such conditions, it seems quite legitimate to claim that\nthe macroscopic body is localised within the sphere.\n\nHowever, also this quite reasonable conclusion has been questioned and\nit has been claimed (Lewis 1997), that the very existence of the tails\nimplies that the enumeration principle (i.e., the fact that the claim\n\u2018particle 1 is within this box & particle 2 is within this\nbox &\u00a0\u2026 & particle \\(n\\) is within this box &\nno other particle is within this box\u2019 implies the claim\n\u2018there are \\(n\\) particles within this box\u2019) does not\nhold, if one takes seriously the mass density interpretation of\ncollapse theories. This paper has given rise to a long debate which\nwould be inappropriate to reproduce here. \n\nWe conclude this brief analysis by stressing once more that, in our\nopinion, all the disagreements and the misunderstandings concerning\nthis problem have their origin in the fact that the idea that the\nprobabilistic interpretation of the wave function must be abandoned\nhas not been fully accepted by the authors who find some difficulties\nin the proposed mass density interpretation of the Collapse Theories.\nFor a more recent reconsideration of the problem we refer the reader\nto the paper by Lewis (2003).\n",
