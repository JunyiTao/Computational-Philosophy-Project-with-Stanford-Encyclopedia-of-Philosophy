    "main_text": "Power as Domination || Radical Feminist Approaches\n3.2 Radical Feminist Approaches\n\nUnlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social resource\nthat ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist phenomenologists,\nwho understand domination in terms of a tension between transcendence\nand immanence, radical feminists tend to understand power in terms of\ndyadic relations of dominance/subordination, often understood on\nanalogy with the relationship between master and slave.\n\nFor example, in the work of legal theorist Catharine MacKinnon,\ndomination is closely bound up with her understanding of gender\ndifference. According to MacKinnon, gender difference is simply the\nreified effect of domination. As she puts it, \u201cdifference is the\nvelvet glove on the iron fist of domination. The problem is not that\ndifferences are not valued; the problem is that they are defined by\npower\u201d (MacKinnon 1989, 219). If gender difference is itself a\nfunction of domination, then the implication is that men are powerful\nand women are powerless by definition. As MacKinnon puts it,\n\u201cwomen/men is a distinction not just of difference, but of power\nand powerlessness\u2026.Power/powerlessness is the sex\ndifference\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 123). (In this passage, MacKinnon\nglosses over the distinction, articulated by many second-wave\nfeminists, between sex \u2013 the biologically rooted traits that\nmake one male or female, traits that are often presumed to be natural\nand immutable \u2013 and gender \u2013 the socially and culturally\nrooted, hence contingent and mutable, traits, characteristics,\ndispositions, and practices that make one a woman or a man. This\npassage suggests that MacKinnon, like Judith Butler (1990) and other\ncritics of the sex/gender distinction, thinks that sex difference, no\nless than gender difference, is socially constructed and shaped by\nrelations of power.) If men are powerful and women powerless as such,\nthen male domination is, on this view, pervasive. Indeed, MacKinnon\nclaims that it is a basic \u201cfact of male supremacy\u201d that\n\u201cno woman escapes the meaning of being a woman within a gendered\nsocial system, and sex inequality is not only pervasive but may be\nuniversal (in the sense of never having not been in some form\u201d\n(MacKinnon 1989, 104\u201305). For MacKinnon, heterosexual\nintercourse is the paradigm of male domination; as she puts it,\n\u201cthe social relation between the sexes is organized so that men\nmay dominate and women must submit and this relation is sexual \u2013\nin fact, is sex\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 3). As a result, she tends to\npresuppose a dyadic conception of domination, according to which\nindividual women are subject to the will of individual men. If male\ndomination is pervasive and women are powerless by definition, then it\nfollows that female power is \u201ca contradiction in terms, socially\nspeaking\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 53). The claim that female power is a\ncontradiction in terms has led many feminists to criticize MacKinnon\non the grounds that she denies women\u2019s political agency and\npresents them as helpless victims (for exemplary versions of this\ncriticism, see Brown 1995 and Butler 1997a).\n\nMarilyn Frye likewise offers a radical feminist analysis of power that\nseems to presuppose a dyadic model of domination. Frye identifies\nseveral faces of power, one of the most important of which is access.\nAs Frye puts it, \u201ctotal power is unconditional access; total\npowerlessness is being unconditionally accessible. The creation and\nmanipulation of power is constituted of the manipulation and control\nof access\u201d (Frye 1983, 103). If access is one of the most\nimportant faces of power, then feminist separatism, insofar as it is a\nway of denying access to women\u2019s bodies, emotional support,\ndomestic labor, and so forth, represents a profound challenge to male\npower. For this reason, Frye maintains that all feminism that is worth\nthe name entails some form of separatism. She also suggests that this\nis the real reason that men get so upset by acts of separatism:\n\u201cif you are doing something that is so strictly forbidden by the\npatriarchs, you must be doing something right\u201d (Frye 1983, 98).\nFrye frequently compares male domination to a master/slave\nrelationship (see, for example, 1983, 103\u2013105), and she defines\noppression as \u201ca system of interrelated barriers and forces\nwhich reduce, immobilize, and mold people who belong to a certain\ngroup, and effect their subordination to another group (individually\nto individuals of the other group, and as a group, to that\ngroup)\u201d (Frye 1983, 33). In addition to access, Frye discusses\ndefinition as another, related, face of power. Frye claims that\n\u201cthe powerful normally determine what is said and sayable\u201d\n(105). For example, \u201cwhen the Secretary of Defense calls\nsomething a peace negotiation\u2026then whatever it is that he\ncalled a peace negotiation is an instance of negotiating peace\u201d\n(105). Under conditions of subordination, women typically do not have\nthe power to define the terms of their situation, but by controlling\naccess, Frye argues, they can begin to assert control over their own\nself-definition. Both of these \u2013 controlling access and\ndefinition \u2013 are ways of taking power. Although she does not go\nso far as MacKinnon does in claiming that female power is a\ncontradiction in terms, Frye does claim that \u201cif there is one\nthing women are queasy about it is actually taking power\u201d (Frye\n1983, 107).\n\nA similar dyadic conception of male domination can arguably be found\nin Carole Pateman\u2019s The Sexual Contract (1988)\n(although Pateman's work is heavily influenced by socialist feminism,\nher account of power is closer to radical feminism). Like MacKinnon,\nPateman claims that gender difference is constituted by domination; as\nshe puts it, \u201cthe patriarchal construction of the difference\nbetween masculinity and femininity is the political difference between\nfreedom and subjection\u201d (Pateman 1988, 207). She also claims\nthat male domination is pervasive, and she explicitly appeals to a\nmaster/subject model to understand it; as she puts it, \u201cin\nmodern civil society all men are deemed good enough to be\nwomen\u2019s masters\u201d (Pateman 1988, 219). In Pateman\u2019s\nview, the social contract that initiates civil society and provides\nfor the legitimate exercise of political rights is also a sexual\ncontract that establishes what she calls \u201cthe law of male\nsex-right,\u201d securing male sexual access to and dominance over\nwomen (1988, 182). As Nancy Fraser has argued, on Pateman\u2019s\nview, the sexual contract \u201cinstitutes a series of male/female\nmaster/subject dyads\u201d (Fraser 1993, 173). Fraser is highly\ncritical of Pateman\u2019s analysis, which she terms the\n\u201cmaster/subject model,\u201d a model that presents\nwomen\u2019s subordination \u201cfirst and foremost as the condition\nof being subject to the direct command of an individual man\u201d\n(1993, 173). The problem with this dyadic account of women\u2019s\nsubordination, according to Fraser, is that \u201cgender inequality\nis today being transformed by a shift from dyadic relations of mastery\nand subjection to more impersonal structural mechanisms that are lived\nthrough more fluid cultural forms\u201d (1993, 180). Fraser suggests\nthat, in order to understand women\u2019s subordination in\ncontemporary Western societies, feminists will have to move beyond the\nmaster/subject model to analyze how women\u2019s subordination is\nsecured through cultural norms, social practices, and other impersonal\nstructural mechanisms. (For Pateman\u2019s response to Fraser\u2019s\ncriticism, see Pateman and Mills (2007, 205\u201306)).\n\nAlthough feminists such as Fraser, Judith Butler, and Wendy Brown have\nbeen highly critical of the radical feminist account of domination,\nanalytic feminists have found this account more productive. For\nexample, Rae Langton (2009) has used speech act theory to defend\nMacKinnon's claims that pornography both causes and constitutes\nwomen's subordination. More generally, Langton (2009) and Sally\nHaslanger (2012) have drawn on MacKinnon's work to develop an account\nof sexual objectification and to explore the ways that objectification\nis often obscured by claims to objectivity (for further discussion of\nHaslanger's work, see section 3.7 below).\n",
