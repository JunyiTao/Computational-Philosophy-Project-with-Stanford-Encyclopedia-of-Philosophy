    "main_text": "\n\nPhilo of Alexandria is a Jewish thinker who lived in Alexandria in the\nfirst half of the first century BCE (Hadas Lebel 2012). Whether he\nreally was a philosopher is a question still debated at length. At the\nbeginning of the Roman Empire, especially for the Stoics and the\nCynics, the fundamental task of a philosopher was the construction of\nhis own self (Foucault 2001). A man who sought to improve himself had\nto first regulate his own nature, controlling his passions and\nemotions and eliminating any gap between theory and practice. He was\nthus supposed to approach the perfection of a god. To the exact\ncontrary of this attitude, Philo\u2019s purpose was to prove the\noudeneia, the ontological nothingness of human beings. In his\nopinion, the only way to have real existence was to admit that one is\nnothing without the help of God, who is the source of freedom,\nlogos (reason) and consciousness. He aimed to be the best\npossible servant of the Revelation and of the text that forms\nGod\u2019s Word. He accepted contradiction as a normal means of\nexpression, which serves as a possible explanation for the disordered\nimpression of his treatises. He was, however, neither ignorant nor\nconfused; rather, he consciously deconstructed the rationalist\npatterns of Greek thought, which in his opinion served to affirm the\nprimacy of the self. He did not want to get rid of logos but\nrather to place it clearly within the unique perspective of divine\ntranscendence. Though he felt great admiration for Plato\n(Reydams-Schils 2008), his transcendence was not exactly Platonic, but\nrather of a God both absolutely unknowable yet very close to mankind.\nNikiprowetzky (1977) inaugurated a new era in Philonian studies by\naffirming the centrality of the Law in the Philo\u2019s thought. In\nthis perspective, philosophy was the servant of Revelation, a way to\nlend his exegesis a more universal impact by drawing upon the\ncategories of Greek logos One of the purposes of our\npresentation will be to give a plausible evaluation of the many images\nand interpretations of Philo that we find in Philonian\nscholarship.\n",
