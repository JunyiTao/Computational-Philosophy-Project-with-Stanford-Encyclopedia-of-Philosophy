    "main_text": "The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika System of Categories || The Underlying Structure of the List\n1.3 The Underlying Structure of the List\n\nFirst divide things up into the existents and the non-existents, the\nlatter corresponding to the category \u2018absence\u2019. Now take\ninherence to be a primitive, fundamental relation. Given such a\nrelation, the following three-fold division is exhaustive:\n\nthings which do not inhere in others, but are inhered in,\nthings which both inhere in others, and are themselves inhered\nin,\nthings which inhere in others, but are not inhered in by\nanything.\n\n\nWe want group (a) to correspond to the category\n\u2018substance\u2019. Unfortunately, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nclaim that wholes are distinct from, and inhere in, their parts. The\nonly substances which do not inhere in anything are the atomic\nsubstances (which for the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas correspond with the\neternal substances). Group (c) corresponds to the category\n\u2018universal\u2019, for universals are said to inhere in things\n(substances, qualities and motions) but do not have anything inhering\nin them. Group (b) comprises, the non-atomic substances, the qualities\nand the motions. Let us now divide this group into two: those which\nare inhered in only by universals, and those which are inhered in by\nother things as well. The former corresponds to the categories\n\u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018motion\u2019, for substances are\ninhered in, not only by universals, but also by qualities, motions, as\nwell as by other substances. Finally, we must find a way to sub-divide\nthe former group into qualities and motions. More traditional\nNaiy\u0101yikas preserve the distinction by saying that motions, but\nnot qualities, cause the substances in which they inhere to come into\ncontact with (or break away from) each other. This, however, appeals\nto the idea of \u2018contact\u2019, which cannot itself be defined\nin terms of our primitive relation inherence. Some radical\nNaiy\u0101yikas (especially Bh\u0101saravaj\u00f1a) claim that\nmotions are just a kind of quality, as their properties are so\nsimilar. The only remaining category is \u2018differentium\u2019\n(vi\u015be\u1e63a), whose members reside in and individuate\nthe eternal substances i.e. the atoms. The point, perhaps, is that all\nother things are individuated by the universals and wholes that inhere\nin them, but two atoms of the same substance are in all respects\nidentical. But if objects are individuated by means of what inheres in\nthem, then there must be something inhering in each atom which\ndistinguishes it from the others\u2014a \u2018differentium\u2019\n(see \u00a710.2).\n\nThis is a rough sketch, omitting many technicalities, of how the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers tried to build their system of\ncategories on logical principles (for an example of such\ntechnicalities, see TSD 3(c). The Manual of Reason points out\nthat a substance cannot be defined as the substratum of qualities,\nbecause of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrine that substances do not\npossess any qualities at the moment when they are created.)\n",
