    "main_text": "Substantive Naturalism || Scandinavian Legal Realism\n5.1 Scandinavian Legal Realism\n\nScandinavian Legal Realism stands out from other major traditions in\nlegal philosophy for expressly placing naturalism\u2014and\nS-naturalism in particular\u2014at center stage. Perhaps the most\nstriking example of this comes in the preface to the Second Edition of\nKarl Olivecrona\u2019s Law as Fact, where Olivecrona states\nthat the aim of his book is \u201cto fit the complex phenomena\ncovered by the word law into the spatio-temporal world\u201d (1971,\np. vii). But S-naturalism is equally prominent in Alf Ross\u2019\nOn Law and Justice (1959, p. 67; see also Spaak 2009, pp.\n40\u201342), probably the most internationally famous contribution to\nthe Scandinavian Realist tradition. Given the centrality of\nS-naturalism to Scandinavian Realism, it is unsurprising that a\nvariety of familiar naturalism-motivated philosophical gambits feature\nprominently in the major Scandinavian Realist texts. These include\nefforts at naturalistic reduction of legal concepts, as well as\nnon-cognitivist and error-theoretic accounts of important aspects of\nlegal discourse. (Some particular examples are discussed below.)\n\nThe S-naturalism of the Scandinavian Realists is today viewed more as\nan intellectual-historical museum piece than as a live contender in\njurisprudential debate. That Scandinavian Realism should have fallen\nout of favor is not altogether surprising, given the strong influence\nof logical positivism and the similar Uppsala school of philosophy on\nthe philosophical outlook and approach of the major Scandinavian\nRealists (Bjarup 1999, p. 774; see also Sandin 1962, p.\n496). Although many would still sympathize broadly with the\nScandinavian Realists\u2019 naturalism, anti-metaphysical\ninclinations, and moral anti-realism, their specific versions of these\ndoctrines have not, as a general matter, aged well. Be that as it may,\nthe poor long-term reception of the Scandinavians may be owed, in\nlarge part, to a rather more accidental cause: the influence of Hart\n(1959). In an influential review of Ross\u2019 On Law and\nJustice\u2014simply (and somewhat misleadingly) titled\n\u201cScandinavian Realism\u201d\u2014Hart famously attacked a\ncentral pillar of Ross\u2019 legal philosophy, namely his austerely\nnaturalistic analysis of the concept of legal validity. Ross (1962)\nresponded in his own review of Hart\u2019s The Concept of\nLaw, arguing that Hart had misunderstood him and that their\nviews, properly understood, were not so far apart.\n\nIn order to understand what it was that Ross proposed and that Hart\nfound so objectionable, it is best to begin with the opening pages of\nOn Law and Justice. There, Ross draws a distinction between\ntwo kinds of linguistic meaning: expressive and representative.\nAccording to Ross, all linguistic utterances, oral or written, have\nexpressive meaning (i.e., express something); but only some have\nrepresentative meaning, i.e., represent states of affairs in the\nworld. Here Ross contrasts an utterance like \u201cmy father is\ndead,\u201d which has expressive and representative meaning, with\nutterances like \u201couch!\u201d and \u201cshut the door,\u201d\nwhich have expressive meaning only. Ross calls utterances with\nrepresentative meaning \u201cassertions.\u201d Utterances without\nrepresentative meaning he calls either \u201cexclamations\u201d or\n\u201cdirectives\u201d\u2014the former if they are not intended to\nexert influence on others (as in the case of a reflexive cry of\n\u201couch!\u201d), the latter if they are intended to exert\ninfluence (as in the case of \u201cshut the door\u201d) (1959, pp.\n6\u20138).\n\nRoss holds that legal rules, such as statutory provisions, are\ndirectives. He explains that such rules are not meant to represent\nstates of affairs, but to influence behavior. Simply put, if a legal\nrule is laid down stating that certain behavior \u201cshall be\npunished\u201d or \u201cgives rise to liability,\u201d this is not\ndone to describe what courts would do anyway, but to direct\nthe behavior of courts (and, indirectly at least, the behavior of\nprivate individuals) (1959, pp. 8\u20139).\n\nWhat, then, of the legal utterances \u201coccurring in a textbook of\nlaw\u201d? Are these assertions or directives? At a surface level,\nRoss tells us, the language in such books will often be similar or\neven identical to the language in an actual statute: a doctrinal\nwriter might, for example, say that certain behavior \u201cgives rise\nto liability\u201d or \u201cshall be punished.\u201d But we should\nnot be misled by this surface similarity, Ross says: \u201cthe\npropositions in a textbook, at any rate to a certain extent, intend to\ndescribe, not to prescribe\u201d (1959, p. 9). To that extent,\ntherefore, they must be assertions, not directives\u2014specifically,\nRoss claims, assertions about what is valid law.\n\nAnd what does it mean to say that something is valid law? In effect,\nRoss tells us, it is to predict the behavior and thinking of courts.\nDetails aside, to say that \u201cX is valid law\u201d\nis in effect to say that (1) judges will act in accordance\nwith X, and (2) in so acting, they will feel themselves bound\nto do so. Hence, claims about what is valid law are claims about\npurely natural-factual states of affairs: facts about the behavior and\npsychology of judges (1959, pp. 42, 73\u201374, 75).\n\nThe Hart\u2013Ross dialogue revolved around the merits of this\nanalysis; Hart, for his part, found it altogether inadequate. Most\ncrucially and memorably, Hart argued that \u201ceven if in the mouth\nof the ordinary citizen or lawyer \u2018this is a valid rule of\nEnglish law\u2019 is a prediction of what [English] judge[s] will do,\nsay and/or feel, this cannot be its meaning in the mouth of a judge\nwho is not engaged in predicting his own or others\u2019 behaviour or\nfeelings.\u201d Instead, it is an \u201cact of recognition\u201d of\n\u201cthe rule in question as one satisfying certain accepted general\ncriteria for admission as a rule of the system and so as a legal\nstandard of behaviour\u201d (1959, p. 165). At root, Hart argued,\nRoss\u2019 analysis of the concept of legal validity fails because\n\u201cthe normal central use of \u2018legally valid\u2019 is in an\ninternal normative statement of a special kind\u201d (1959, p.\n167).\n\nLater, in his review of Hart\u2019s The Concept of Law, Ross\nclaimed that Hart had misunderstood him. In his analysis of\n\u201cvalid law,\u201d Ross replied, he had been concerned\nspecifically with \u201clegal concepts as they function in the\ndoctrinal study of law, what we on the Continent are accustomed to\ncall the science of law,\u201d and if this were adequately\nunderstood, it would be evident that much of the apparent disagreement\nbetween him and Hart was illusory (1962, p. 1190). In effect, Ross\nsaid, he had been analyzing legal statements of a kind Hart would have\nclassified as \u201cexternal.\u201d Ross chalked up the confusion at\nleast in part to the translation of the Danish phrase\n\u201cg\u00e6ldende ret\u201d as \u201cvalid law,\u201d\nacknowledging that the results sounded \u201codd in English\nusage,\u201d and suggesting in passing that \u201cexisting\nlaw\u201d or \u201claw in force\u201d might have better captured\nwhat he had in mind. (For further discussion of the translation\nquestion, see Eng 2011.)\n\nA number of subsequent authors who have revisited the Hart\u2013Ross\ndebate have expressed broad sympathy for Ross\u2019 claims to have\nbeen misunderstood. (See Pattaro 2009, pp. 545\u2013546; Eng 2011;\nHoltermann 2014, p. 166 n. 4.) Nonetheless, as a matter of\nintellectual history, Hart\u2019s critique had its effect. There has,\nhowever, been a recent uptick in interest in Scandinavian Legal\nRealism, perhaps owing in part to a broader renewal of interest in\nnaturalism in legal philosophy. This has not been limited to strictly\nhistorical or exegetical work, but has included efforts to mine the\nScandinavian Realists\u2019 writings for philosophical strategies or\ninsights that might help advance contemporary legal philosophy, or to\noffer fruitful rational reconstructions of their ideas. (See, e.g.,\nHoltermann 2014; Spaak 2014, Ch. 10.)\n\nOne topic of some contemporary interest to which the Scandinavian\nRealists may be relevant is the possibility of understanding legal\nlanguage in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist terms. Largely owing\nto Kevin Toh\u2019s work on the subject, there has been some recent\ninterest in legal (or \u201cmeta-legal\u201d) expressivism, that is,\ntreatments of legal statements as expressions of distinctive (perhaps\nconative) mental states. (See Toh 2005; Toh 2011; Etchemendy 2016.)\nContemporary legal expressivists might look to the Scandinavian\nRealists as intellectual forebears of a sort, given the prominence of\nnon-cognitivist ideas in their theories of legal language.\n\nAs is widely recognized, the Scandinavian Realists were ethical\nnon-cognitivists. (Bjarup 1999, p. 775; Ross 1959, p. 313; Spaak 2009,\npp. 42\u201344, 52\u201355, 64.) In principle, this would not\nrequire adopting expressivist or non-cognitivist accounts of legal\nstatements, but as it happens Ross and Olivecrona did understand\nsubstantial parts of legal discourse on this model. To be sure, Ross\nanalyzed statements about \u201cvalid law\u201d as assertions of\nnaturalistic fact, and thus cognitive. But, as discussed earlier, Ross\nthought some legal utterances were non-cognitive directives. This most\nobviously included legal rules themselves, as in the provisions of a\nstatute. But Ross also thought jurists\u2019 doctrinal writings were\ntypically a blend of cognitive assertions of valid law and\nnon-cognitive directives, the latter being in effect advice calculated\nto influence the behavior of the judiciary (1959, pp. 46\u201349). In\nadvancing this idea, Ross was not merely making the banal point that\ndoctrinal writing is frequently laced with transparently normative\nclaims about how courts should decide cases. His point was subtler\nthan this; telegraphically stated, Ross\u2019 observation was that\ndoctrinal writers sometimes do (and sometimes intend to) influence\njudges by making statements that could, on their face, equally be\ninterpreted as straightforward predictive/descriptive claims. It turns\nout, therefore, that Ross had a rather nuanced understanding of the\nmix of cognitive (or representational/descriptive) and non-cognitive\n(or directive/prescriptive) elements in legal discourse.\n\nIf anything, non-cognitivist ideas play an even more striking role in\nOlivecrona\u2019s mature legal philosophy, notably as set out in the\nSecond Edition of Law as Fact. Unsatisfied with efforts to\nreduce talk of legal rights to claims about naturalistic states of\naffairs, Olivecrona ultimately concludes that the word\n\u201cright,\u201d as commonly used, does not signify anything and\nlacks semantic reference (1971, pp. 183\u2013184). In the first\ninstance, he argues, statements about legal rights serve a directive\nfunction, though they can also indirectly serve to communicate\ninformation about actual (naturalistic) facts. Ultimately, Olivecrona\nextends this analysis to legal language in general, concluding:\n\u201cLegal language is not a descriptive language. It is a\ndirective, influential language serving as an instrument of social\ncontrol\u201d (1971, p. 253). Lest there be doubts about how far\nOlivecrona took this idea, he went on to observe that on his account,\n\u201cCitizen, government, parliament, law, right, duty, marriage,\nelections, taxes, corporations, and princess all belong to th[e]\ncategory\u201d of \u201cwords which\u2026lack semantic\nreference\u201d (1971, p. 255). Thus, Olivecrona found no place for\nmany of the \u201cthings\u201d legal language is ostensibly\n\u201cabout\u201d in the world of facts that he countenanced as an\nS-naturalist. As so often happens with philosophers who embrace\nnon-cognitivism about some domain of thought and talk, however,\nOlivecrona was equally insistent that legal language and\nideas do find a place in reality. He accordingly devoted\nconsiderable attention to describing the function of legal language in\nsociety\u2014concluding, ultimately, that \u201clegal language plays\na vital role\u201d as \u201can instrument of social control,\u201d\n\u201cfor keeping the peace, as well as for sending men to death on\nthe battlefield\u201d (1971, p. 254). Insofar as there is some\ncontemporary interest in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist accounts\nof legal thought and talk, therefore, Scandinavian Realism may offer\ninteresting intellectual-historical reference points (and possibly\nsubstantive inspiration) for the further development of such\nideas.\n",
