    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues in Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Pure Land Buddhist Hermeneutics\n4.3 Pure Land Buddhist Hermeneutics\n\nIssues of hermeneutics are central to the Japanese Pure Land tradition\nbecause of the breach it asserts between the ordinary awareness of\nbeings and the enlightened wisdom-compassion of the Buddha, which is\nthe source and ultimate content of the teaching. This is not, of\ncourse, a problem limited to the Pure Land tradition, but has\nengaged Buddhist tradition from the time of Sakyamuni.\nNevertheless, communicating its teaching raises special difficulties\nfor H\u014dnen\u2019s Pure Land thought because of its thoroughly\nnegative assessment of human capacities of comprehension. It views\nhuman understanding as constantly subject to the distortions\nof self-attachment. Thus, for the teaching to be authentically\ngrasped, two conditions must arise. First, the Buddhas\u2014Amida,\nSakyamuni, and the Buddhas of the cosmos\u2014must actively work to\nbridge the gap between dharma and beings\u2019 ignorance, enabling\nbeings\u2019 apprehension of the vow. Second, a shift or transformation of\nawareness must emerge in beings.\n\nThe narrative settings of the Pure Land teachings in the sutras were\nregarded as particularly significant in this regard. The\nContemplation Sutra was especially important in\nH\u014dnen\u2019s interpretation of Amida\u2019s vow, and narratives\nin that sutra were understood to reveal both Sakyamuni\u2019s intent\nin expounding the Pure Land teaching and the proper stance for\nunderstanding it. According to the sutra, the circumstances for\nSakyamuni\u2019s teaching of Amida and his Pure Land relate to the\nstory of Prince Aj\u0101ta\u015batru, who, prompted by the\nBuddha\u2019s jealous cousin Devadatta, usurps the throne by\nmurdering his father and imprisoning his mother Vaidehi. From her\ncell, Vaidehi beseeches the Buddha to teach her a way to be born in a\nworld free of such treachery and turmoil. This leads to\nSakyamuni\u2019s exposition of Amida\u2019s Pure Land.\n\nIn East Asian Pure Land tradition, this royal \u201ctragedy of the\ncapital of R\u0101jag\u1e5bha,\u201d where Sakyamuni often resided\nand preached, was understood to indicate that the Pure Land teaching\nwas intended for ordinary, unenlightened beings in anguished\ncircumstances, rather than for a capable spiritual elite. Shinran\nemphasizes the distance between this world and the realm of\nenlightenment by asserting that at the point in history when\nconditions were ripe for teaching and reception of the Pure Land path,\nthe entire drama of regicide and betrayal was played out by incarnated\nbodhisattvas precisely to allow for the introduction of the Pure Land\nteaching. It is, therefore, the condition of self-reflection and\nrepentance that allows for the reception of the Pure Land teaching. As\nwe have seen, for the Pure Land tradition that H\u014dnen adopted from\nChina, this motif is reiterated in the sutra narrative of the lowest\ngrade of nembutsu practitioner, who has committed evil throughout his\nlife but encounters the teaching through a good friend on his deathbed\nand simply utters Amida\u2019s name ten times.\n\nIn terms of reception, some among H\u014dnen\u2019s disciples further\nemphasized the action of Amida and Sakyamuni in guiding and actively\nbringing beings to trust in the vow. While the Chinzei branch of\nH\u014dnen\u2019s Pure Land school sought to temper the\nmaster\u2019s sweeping rejection of other practices by recognizing\nthe possibility of attaining birth through the various meditative and\nnonmeditative practices set forth in the Contemplation Sutra,\nSh\u014dk\u016b and his Seizan branch taught that the intent of the\nsutra is precisely to lead people to awareness that birth is possible\nonly through the nembutsu. In the latter view, the various\ncontemplative exercises and the disciplines and study taught by the\nsutra are meant to reveal the wisdom-compassion of the vow, which\ngrasps all beings without discrimination, whatever their capacity.\nSince in the sutra beings attain birth regardless of their particular\nlevel or kind of practice, it is not that those practices are being\nprescribed; rather, the sutra intends to show that the actual cause of\nbirth lies not in any such practices, but solely in Amida\u2019s vow.\nIn other words, the sutra teachings are not to be taken literally and\nprescriptively, but as means to awaken beings so that they come to\nentrust themselves to the vow.\n\nIn Shinran, the activity of the vow is more direct, for he asserts\nthat shinjin in beings is itself the mind of Amida and that Amida\ngives his mind to beings. Thus, for example, Shinran interprets the\nnembutsu to be not the invocation of the Buddha by beings but rather\nthe Buddha\u2019s call to beings in order to awaken them.\nSh\u014dk\u016b makes a similar claim, asserting that when a person\ntakes refuge in Amida\u2019s vow, then the Buddha, who is the\nembodiment of perfect practice performed out of the desire to save all\nbeings, enters and becomes one with the person\u2019s aspiration.\nThis oneness manifests itself as the nembutsu. We see in such thinkers\nthat genuine engagement with the teaching is not primarily\nintellectual understanding or simple assent, but a transformative\nencounter in which the dualism of the person\u2019s samsaric\nexistence and Amida\u2019s wisdom-compassion is transcendent.\n",
