    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || The Nature of Philosophy\n3.7 The Nature of Philosophy\n\nIn his later writings Wittgenstein holds, as he did in the\nTractatus, that philosophers do not\u2014or should\nnot\u2014supply a theory, neither do they provide explanations.\n\u201cPhilosophy just puts everything before us, and neither explains\nnor deduces anything.\u2014Since everything lies open to view there\nis nothing to explain\u201d (PI 126). The anti-theoretical\nstance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein, but there are\nmanifest differences. Although the Tractatus precludes\nphilosophical theories, it does construct a systematic edifice which\nresults in the general form of the proposition, all the while relying\non strict formal logic; the Investigations points out the\ntherapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy, verily instructing\nphilosophers in the ways of therapy. \u201cThe work of the\nphilosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular\npurpose\u201d (PI 127). Working with reminders and series of\nexamples, different problems are solved. Unlike the Tractatus\nwhich advanced one philosophical method, in the\nInvestigations \u201cthere is not a single philosophical\nmethod, though there are indeed methods, different therapies, as it\nwere\u201d (PI 133d). This is directly related to\nWittgenstein\u2019s eschewal of the logical form or of any\na-priori generalization that can be discovered or made in philosophy.\nTrying to advance such general theses is a temptation which lures\nphilosophers; but the real task of philosophy is both to make us aware\nof the temptation and to show us how to overcome it. Consequently\n\u201ca philosophical problem has the form: \u2018I don\u2019t know\nmy way about.\u2019\u201d (PI 123), and hence the aim of\nphilosophy is \u201cto show the fly the way out of the\nfly-bottle\u201d (PI 309).\n\nThe refusal of theory goes hand in hand with Wittgenstein\u2019s\nobjection to have \u201canything hypothetical in our [philosophical]\nconsiderations\u201d (PI 109): \u201cAll\nexplanation must disappear, and description alone must take\nits place.\u201d In The Blue Book, Wittgenstein explained\nthe difficulty encountered by philosophers to work on a minor scale\nand to take seriously \u201cthe particular case\u201d as originating\nfrom their \u201ccraving for generality.\u201d This craving is\nstrongly influenced by philosophers\u2019 \u201cpreoccupation with\nthe method of science,\u201d a reductive and unifying tendency which\nis \u201cthe real source of metaphysics\u201d (BB 18).\nWittgenstein\u2019s determined anti-scientism should not be read as\nan opposition to science in itself; it is the insistence that\nphilosophy and science are to be kept apart \u2013 that (contrary to\nthe prevalent attitude of modern civilization) the scientific\nframework is not appropriate everywhere, and certainly not for\nphilosophical investigations.\n\nThe style of the Investigations is strikingly different from\nthat of the Tractatus. Instead of strictly numbered sections\nwhich are organized hierarchically in programmatic order, the\nInvestigations fragmentarily voices aphorisms about\nlanguage-games, family resemblance, forms of life, \u201csometimes\njumping, in a sudden change, from one area to another\u201d\n(PI Preface). This variation in style is of course essential\nand is \u201cconnected with the very nature of the\ninvestigation\u201d (PI Preface). As a matter of fact,\nWittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages\nof his thought, suggesting publication of both texts together in order\nto make the contrast obvious and clear.\n\nStill, it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy\nthat the fundamental continuity between these two stages, rather than\nthe discrepancy between them, is to be found. In both cases philosophy\nserves, first, as critique of language. It is through analyzing\nlanguage\u2019s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the\ntraps of meaningless philosophical formulations. This means that what\nwas formerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve\n\u201cand this simply means that the philosophical problems should\ncompletely disappear\u201d (PI 133). Two\nimplications of this diagnosis, easily traced back in the\nTractatus, are to be recognized. One is the inherent\ndialogical character of philosophy, which is a responsive activity:\ndifficulties and torments are encountered which are then to be\ndissipated by philosophical therapy. In the Tractatus, this\ntook the shape of advice: \u201cThe correct method in philosophy\nwould really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said,\ni.e. propositions of natural science \u2026 and then whenever\nsomeone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to\nhim that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his\npropositions\u201d (TLP 6.53) The second, more far-\nreaching, \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the Investigations\n\u201cis the one that enables me to break off philosophizing when I\nwant to\u201d (PI 133). This has been taken to revert back\nto the ladder metaphor and the injunction to silence in the\nTractatus.\n",
