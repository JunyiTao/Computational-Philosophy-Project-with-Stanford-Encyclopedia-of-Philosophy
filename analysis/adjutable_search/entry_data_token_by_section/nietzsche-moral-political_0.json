    "main_text": "The Critique of Morality || Scope of the Critique: Morality in the Pejorative Sense\n1.1 Scope of the Critique: Morality in the Pejorative Sense\n\nNietzsche is not a critic of all \u201cmorality.\u201d He\nexplicitly embraces, for example, the idea of a \u201chigher\nmorality\u201d which would inform the lives of \u201chigher\nmen\u201d (Schacht 1983: 466\u2013469), and, in so doing, he employs\nthe same German word \u2014 Moral, sometimes\nMoralit\u00e4t \u2014 for both what he attacks and what he\npraises. Moreover, Nietzsche aims to offer a revaluation of existing\nvalues in a manner that appears, itself, to involve appeal to broadly\n\u201cmoral\u201d standards of some sort. As he writes in the\nPreface to Daybreak: \u201cin this book faith in morality\n[Moral] is withdrawn \u2014 but why? Out of\nmorality [Moralit\u00e4t]! Or what else should we call\nthat which informs it \u2014 and us?\u2026.[T]here is no\ndoubt that a \u2018thou shalt\u2019 [du sollst] speaks to\nus too\u201d (D 4). This means, of course, that morality as the\nobject of Nietzsche\u2019s critique must be distinguishable from the\nsense of \u201cmorality\u201d he retains and employs.\n\nYet Nietzsche also does not confine his criticisms of morality to some\none religiously, philosophically, socially or historically\ncircumscribed example. Thus, it will not suffice to say that he simply\nattacks Christian or Kantian or European or utilitarian morality\n\u2014 though he certainly at times attacks all of these. To do\njustice to the scope of his critique, we should ask what characterizes\n\u201cmorality\u201d in Nietzsche\u2019s pejorative sense \u2014\nhereafter, \u201cMPS\u201d \u2014 that is, morality as the object\nof his critique.\n\nNietzsche believes that all normative systems which perform something\nlike the role we associate with \u201cmorality\u201d share certain\nstructural characteristics, even as the meaning and value of these\nnormative systems varies considerably over time. In particular, all\nnormative systems have both descriptive and\nnormative components, in the sense that: (a) they presuppose\na particular descriptive account of human being and human agency, in\nthe sense that for the normative claims comprising the system to have\nintelligible application to humans, particular metaphysical and\nempirical claims about human beings and agency must be true; and (b)\nthe system\u2019s norms favor the interests of some people, often\n(though not necessarily) at the expense of others. Any particular\nmorality will, in turn, be the object of Nietzsche\u2019s critique\n(i.e., MPS) only if it:\n\npresupposes three particular descriptive claims about the nature\nof humans pertaining to free will, the transparency of the self, and\ntheir essential similarity in morally relevant respects (\u201cthe\nDescriptive Component\u201d); and/or\nembraces norms that harm the \u201chighest men\u201d while\nbenefiting the \u201clowest\u201d (\u201cthe Normative\nComponent\u201d).\n\n\nWhile Nietzsche offers criticisms of both the Descriptive and\nNormative Components of MPS, what ultimately defines MPS as against\nunobjectionable normative systems is the distinctive normative agenda.\nThus, while Nietzsche criticizes the description of agency that is\npart of many versions of MPS, he also holds that \u201c[i]t is\nnot error as error that\u201d he objects to fundamentally in\nMPS (EH IV;7): that is, it is not the falsity of the\ndescriptive account of agency presupposed by MPS, per se,\nthat is the heart of the problem, but rather its distinctive normative\ncommitments. Thus, strictly speaking, it is true that an MPS would be\nobjectionable even if it did not involve a commitment to an untenable\ndescriptive account of agency (as, say, certain forms of\nutilitarianism do not). Because Nietzsche\u2019s two most common\n\u2014 and closely related \u2014 specific targets are, however,\nChristian and Kantian morality, the critique of the descriptive\ncomponent of MPS figures prominently in Nietzsche\u2019s writing, and\nany account of the logic of his critique that omitted it would not do\njustice to his concerns.\n",
