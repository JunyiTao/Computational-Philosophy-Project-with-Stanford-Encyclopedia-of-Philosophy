    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nAlmost nothing is known about the life of Thomas of Erfurt except that\nhe was active as a teacher and philosopher in the first quarter of the\nfourteenth\n century.[1]\n Presumably, he came from the city of Erfurt in present-day Germany.\nHis work shows the influence of the Paris Arts Masters Radulphus Brito\n(ca. 1270\u20131320) and Siger of Courtrai (ca. 1280\u20131341),\nwhich suggests that he was educated and perhaps also taught at the\nUniversity of\n Paris.[2]\n Later documents associate him with the school of St. Severus and the\nSchottenkloster of St. Jacob at\n Erfurt.[3]\n His most famous grammatical text, De modis significandi (On\nthe Modes of Signifying) was known by 1310 and was already being\ncommented upon by 1324. It is possible that he returned to Paris a\nnumber of times over the course of his academic career, although there\nare no records attesting to this.\n\nSome copies of De modis significandi attribute the work to an\nearly fourteenth-century English cleric named Thomas of Occam, but\nscholars have been skeptical about this because it occurs in just a\nhandful fifteenth-century\n manuscripts.[4]\n The vast majority of the manuscript evidence, and all of the earliest\nwitnesses, refer to its author as Thomas of Erfurt.\n",
