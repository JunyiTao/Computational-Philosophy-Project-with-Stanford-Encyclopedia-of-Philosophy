A \u201cgame\u201d in this sense is a model of\na strategic interaction between agents (\u201cplayers\u201d), each\nof whom has a set of available actions or strategies. Each combination\nof the players\u2019 strategic responses has a designated outcome or\na \u201cpayoff\u201d. In contrast to traditional game theory, which\nfocuses on agents\u2019 rational decision-making aimed at maximizing\ntheir payoff in one-off interactions, the evolutionary approach\nfocuses on repeated interactions in a population. A game is assumed to\nbe played over and over again by players who are randomly drawn from a\nlarge population. While agents start with a certain strategic\nbehavior, they learn and gradually adjust their responses according to\nspecific rules called \u201cdynamics\u201d (for example, by\nimitating other players or by considering their own past\ninteractions). As a result, successful strategies will diffuse across\nthe community. In this way, evolutionary game-theoretic models can be\nused to explain how a distribution of strategies across the population\nchanges over time as an outcome of long-term population-level\nprocesses. While the standard approach to game theory has primarily\nfocused on combinations of players\u2019 strategies that lead to a\n\u201cstable\u201d state, such as the Nash equilibrium\u2014a state\nin which no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing\ntheir strategy\u2014the evolutionary approach has been used to study\nhow equilibria emerge in a community (see the entries on\n game theory\n and on\n evolutionary game theory).\n\nEvolutionary game theory was originally introduced in biology\n(Lewontin 1961; Maynard Smith 1982). It subsequently gained interest\nof social scientists and philosophers as a tool for studying cultural\nevolution, that is, for investigations into how beliefs and norms\nchange over time (Axelrod 1984; Skyrms 1996). The models can be\nimplemented using a mathematical treatment based on differential\nequations, or using agent-based modeling. While the former approach\nemploys certain idealizations, such as an infinite population size or\nperfect mixing of populations, ABMs were introduced to study scenarios\nin which such assumptions are relaxed (see, e.g., Adami, Schossau,\n& Hintze 2016).\n\nApplications of evolutionary game theory to social epistemology of\nscience were especially inspired by models of bargaining, studying how\ndifferent bargaining norms emerge from local interactions of\nindividuals (Skyrms 1996; Axtell, Epstein, & Young 2001). The\nframework was introduced to the study of epistemic communities by\nO\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019), building up on Bruner\u2019s (2019)\nmodel of cultural\n interactions.[5]\n\n\nThe basic idea of bargaining models is as follows: agents bargain over\nshares of available resources, where their demands and expectations\nabout others\u2019 demands evolve endogenously in view of their\nprevious interactions. Applied to the context of science, bargaining\nconcerns not only explicit negotiations over financial resources, but\nalso situations in which scientists need to agree how to divide their\nworkload in joint projects (O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019). For\nexample, if two scientists are working on a joint paper or if they are\norganizing a conference together they will have to agree on how much\ntime and effort each of them will devote to it. The norms determining\nsuch a division of labor may not be fair. For example, if scientist\nA puts much less effort into the project than scientist\nB, but they both get the same recognition for its success,\nB will be disadvantaged. Similarly, if they agree on A\nbeing the first author in a collaborative paper, while B ends\nup working much more on it, the outcome will again be unfair. Such\nnorms may become entrenched in the scientific community, especially in\nthe context of interactions between members of majority and minority\ngroups in academia. But how do such norms emerge? Are biases favoring\nmembers of certain groups over others necessary for the emergence of\nsuch discriminatory patterns, or can they become entrenched due to\nother, perhaps more surprising factors?\n\nEvolutionary game-theoretic models have been used to study these and\nrelated questions. Bargaining is represented as a strategic\ninteraction between two agents, each of whom makes a demand concerning\nthe issue at hand (for instance, a certain amount of workload, the\norder of authors\u2019 names in a joint publication, and so on).\nDepending on each agent\u2019s demand, each gets a certain payoff.\nFor instance, suppose A and B wish to organize a\nconference and they start by negotiating who will cover which tasks.\nIf they both make a high demand in the sense that each is willing to\nput only a minimal effort into the project while expecting the other\nto cover the rest of the tasks, they will fail to organize the event.\nIf B, on the other hand, makes a low demand (by taking on a\nlarger portion of the work) while A makes a high demand, they\nwill be able to organize the conference, though the division of labor\nwill be unfair (assuming they both get equal credit for successfully\nrealizing the project).\n\nThe game, originating in the work of John Nash (1950), is called the\n\u201cNash demand game\u201d (or the \u201cmini-Nash demand\ngame\u201d). Each player in the game makes their demand (Low, Med or\nHigh). If the demands do not jointly exceed a given resource, each\nplayer gets what they asked for. If they do exceed the available\nresource, no-one gets anything. In the example above, High can be\ninterpreted as demanding to work less than the other on the\norganization of the conference, or demanding the first authorship in a\njoint paper while putting relatively lower effort into it. Similarly,\nLow corresponds to the willingness to take on a larger portion of the\nwork (relative to the order of authors in case of the joint paper),\nwhile Med corresponds to demanding a fair distribution of labor.\n Table 1\n displays the payoffs in such a game. Any combination of demands that\ngives a joint payoff of 10 is a Nash equilibrium, which means that\neither player\u2019s strategy is the best response to the other\nplayer\u2019s one. While a Nash equilibrium may correspond to a fair\ndistribution of resources (if both players demand Med), it may also\ncorrespond to an unfair one (if one player demands Low and the other\none High). This raises the question: which equilibrium will the\ncommunity achieve if agents learn from their previous interactions? In\nparticular, if the individuals are divided into sub-groups (which may\nbe of different sizes), where their membership can be identified by\nmeans of markers visible to other agents, they can develop strategies\nconditional on the group membership of their co-players. Which\nequilibrium state will such a community evolve to? To study such\nquestions, evolutionary models employ rules or dynamics that determine\nhow players update their strategies and how the distribution of\nstrategies across the community changes over\n time.[6]\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nLow\nMed\nHigh  \n\n\nLow\nL,L\nL,5\nL,H \n\nMed\n5,L\n5,5\n0,0 \n\nHigh\nH,L\n0,0\n0,0  \n\n\nTable 1: A payoff table in the Nash\ndemand game. The rows show the strategic options of Player1 and the\ncolumns the options of Player2. Each cell shows the payoff Player1\ngets for the given combination of options, followed by the payoff for\nPlayer2. Players can make three demands: Low, Med and High for the\ntotal resource of 10. The payoffs are represented as L, M and H, where\n\\(\\mathrm{M}= 5\\), \\(\\mathrm{L} < 5 < \\mathrm{H}\\), and\n\\(\\mathrm{L} + \\mathrm{H} = 10\\). (cf. O\u2019Connor & Bruner\n2019; Rubin & O\u2019Connor 2018) \n\n\nThe modeling framework based on bargaining has been used to study\nnorms in scientific collaborations and inequalities that may emerge\nthrough them. For example, O\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019)\ninvestigate the emergence of discriminatory norms in academic\ninteractions between minority and majority members. Rubin and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) study the emergence of discriminatory patterns\nand their effects on diversity in collaboration networks, while\nVentura (2023) examines the impact of the structure of collaborative\nnetworks on the emergence of discriminatory norms even if there are no\nvisible markers of an agent\u2019s membership to a sub-group.\nMoreover, Klein, Marx, and Scheller (2020) use a similar framework to\nstudy the relationship between rationality and inequality, that is,\nthe success of different strategies for bargaining (such as maximizing\nexpected utility) and their impact on the emergence of inequality.\n",
