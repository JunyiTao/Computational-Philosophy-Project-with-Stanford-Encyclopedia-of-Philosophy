    "main_text": "Answering the Evaluation Question || Manipulation and Autonomy\n3.3 Manipulation and Autonomy\n\nAnother natural way to account for the wrongness of manipulation would\nbe to claim that it violates, undermines, or is otherwise antithetical\nto the target\u2019s personal autonomy. Manipulation, by definition,\ninfluences decision-making by means that\u2014unlike rational\npersuasion\u2014do not seem to be autonomy-preserving. Thus, it is\nnatural to regard it as interfering with autonomous decision-making.\nThe idea that manipulation is wrong because it undermines autonomous\nchoice is implicit in discussions of manipulation as a potential\ninvalidator of consent. But even outside of discussions of autonomous\nconsent, the claim that manipulation is immoral because it undermines\nautonomy is commonly made (and perhaps even more commonly\nassumed).\n\nHowever, there are reasons for caution about tying the moral status of\nmanipulation too tightly to its effects on autonomy. One can imagine\ncases where it is not obvious that manipulation undermines autonomy.\nOne can even imagine cases where manipulation might enhance the\ntarget\u2019s overall autonomy. For example, a teacher might\nmanipulate a student into taking a class which ultimately enhances her\nautonomy by opening new career options, improving her skills of\ncritical self-reflection, etc. We might also imagine cases where\nmanipulation is used to support the target\u2019s autonomous choice.\nSuppose that Tonya has autonomously decided to leave an abusive\npartner, but that she is now tempted to go back. If Irving resorts to\na manipulative tactic designed to keep her from backsliding on her\nautonomous choice to leave her abuser, then his action might seem less\nlike undermining Tonya\u2019s autonomy and more like supporting\nit.\n\nOne might respond that these examples do not undermine the claim that\nmanipulation is wrong when and because it undermines autonomy because\nthese autonomy-enhancing instances of manipulation are not wrong.\nHowever, this response faces a complication: Consider the case where\nIrving manipulates Tonya into resisting the temptation to backslide on\nher resolution to leave her abusive partner. It seems plausible to say\nthat Irving\u2019s manipulation in this case is not wrong on balance.\nBut it also seems plausible to say that it was nevertheless pro\ntanto wrong, since it seems plausible to think that it would have\nbeen morally preferable for Irving to find some non-manipulative way\nto help Tonya avoid backsliding. But this judgment seems inconsistent\nwith the claim that manipulation is wrong when and because it\nundermines autonomy. Of course, it is open to defenders of the\nautonomy account of the wrongness of manipulation to bite the bullet\nhere and deny that autonomy-enhancing manipulation is even pro\ntanto immoral.\n\nAlternatively\u2014and perhaps more plausibly\u2014the defender of\nthe autonomy account of the wrongness of manipulation might concede\nthat Irving\u2019s autonomy-enhancing manipulation of Tonya is\npro tanto wrong. But she might explain this by claiming that\nwhile the manipulation is autonomy-enhancing overall, it nevertheless\nundermines Tonya\u2019s autonomy in the short term. The fact that\nIrving\u2019s manipulation undermines Tonya\u2019s autonomy\ntemporarily explains why it is pro tanto immoral\u2014and\nwhy it would be morally better for Irving to find a non-manipulative\nway to help Tonya avoid backsliding. But the fact that the\nmanipulation enhances Tonya\u2019s autonomy overall explains why it\nis not immoral on balance. Of course, this strategy will not appeal to\nthose who hold that it is wrong to undermine a person\u2019s autonomy\neven when doing so enhances that same person\u2019s overall\nautonomy.\n\nA more significant threat to the link between manipulation and\nautonomy appears in an influential paper by Sarah Buss. She argues\nthat \u201cwhen we are obligated to refrain from manipulation or\ndeceiving one another, this has relatively little to do with the value\nof autonomy\u201d (S. Buss 2005: 208). Buss\u2019s argument has two\nparts. First, she claims that manipulation does not, in fact, deprive\nits victim of the ability to make choices; indeed, it typically\npresupposes that the target will make her own choice. But if the\nmanipulation does not take away the target\u2019s choice, Buss\nmaintains, it does not undermine her autonomy. (For a similar\nargument, see Long 2014). Second, Buss argues that it is false to\nclaim that an autonomous agent would rationally reject being subjected\nto manipulative influences. To support this claim, Buss argues that\nmanipulation and deception are \u201cpervasive forms of human\ninteraction which are often quite benign and even valuable\u201d (S.\nBuss 2005: 224). Her most notable example is the cultivation of\nromantic love, which often involves\u2014and may even\nrequire\u2014significant amounts of behavior that is aptly described\nas manipulation.\n\nDefenders of the link between autonomy and the wrongness of\nmanipulation are not without potential replies to Buss\u2019s\nintriguing argument. For one thing, it seems possible to craft a\nnotion of autonomy according to which having false information (or\nother faulty mental states) or being subjected to pressure (even when\nit does not rise to the level of coercion) compromise a person\u2019s\nautonomy. Even though false beliefs about how to achieve one\u2019s\nends may not compromise one\u2019s authentic values or one\u2019s\npowers of practical reasoning, they do seem to compromise one\u2019s\nability to achieve one\u2019s autonomously-chosen ends, and it is\nplausible to regard this as a diminishment of (some form of) autonomy.\nMoreover, the defender of the link between autonomy and the wrongness\nof manipulation might simply deny that the forms of manipulation to\nwhich an autonomous agent would consent (for example, those required\nby romantic love) are wrongful cases of manipulation.\n",
