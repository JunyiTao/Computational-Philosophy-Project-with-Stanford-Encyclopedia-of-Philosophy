Dialogical Conceptions\n\nA discussion of self-regarding attitudes raises the question of the\ninterrelation between self-interpretation and interpretation of the\nself by others. Charles Taylor comments on the dialogical nature of\nthe social self. Taylor writes that \u201cwe define our identity\nalways in dialogue with, sometimes in struggle against, the things our\nsignificant others want to see in us\u201d (Taylor 1994, 28; compare\nOshana 2005, 78). In the same vein, several authors pursue\n\u201cdialogical\u201d conceptions of autonomy in which an\nagent\u2019s answerability to others is the key condition.\nAs we saw above, Benson explicates the notion of self-worth as in part\na requirement of \u201cregarding oneself as being competent to answer\nfor one\u2019s conduct\u201d (Benson 1994, 660). He develops this\nidea in recent work to argue that autonomous agents are those who\ntreat themselves as answerable for their conduct, who claim the\nauthority to speak for themselves (Benson 2005b, 111 ff.) Catriona\nMackenzie also proposes an account based on agents\u2019\nanswerability to others. For Mackenzie, being self-governing is to\nhave \u201cnormative authority\u201d over one\u2019s decisions,\nwhich means that an agent must \u201cregard herself as the legitimate\nsource of the authority, as able, and authorized, to speak for\nherself\u2026[S]uch attitudes towards oneself can only be sustained\nin relations of intersubjective recognition\u201d (Mackenzie 2008,\n4).\n\nAndrea Westlund has developed a dialogical approach in some detail\n(Westlund 2003; 2009; 2012; 2018). For Westlund, autonomy is neither a\nstructural nor a historical capacity of critical reflection, but\nrather a disposition of an agent to \u201chold herself answerable,\nfor her action-guiding commitments, to external critical\nperspectives\u201d (Westlund 2009, 35). Westlund notes that\n\u201cAutonomous agents will, in one way or another, manifest\nresponsiveness to justificatory challenges and their disposition to do\nso is partly constitutive of their status as self-governing\u201d\n(Westlund 2009, 40). Excessively deferential agents such as the\nDeferential Wife will almost certainly fail to have this disposition.\nThese agents will not treat themselves as authoritative and\nanswerable for their conduct; rather, the way in which they answer for\nthemselves (if they do so at all) will be governed by the reasons of\nthe agents to whom they defer. Westlund argues, however, that it\nshould not be assumed that the women described in the hard cases above\nare \u201cpsychologically similar to each other\u201d (Westlund\n2009, 29). For example, Westlund wants to allow that agents who adopt\noppressive practices that significantly inhibit their equality may do\nso autonomously and believes that if a \u201cfundamentalist woman\ndoes freely and authentically accept a condition of social and\npersonal subordination, it seems\u2026problematic to assume that her\ncondition as subordinate, in and of itself, undermines her status as a\nself-governing agent\u201d (Westlund 2009, 29). Westlund\ndistinguishes between two (hypothetical) fundamentalist women, both of\nwhom accept their condition of subordination but only one of whom\n\u201cis prepared to take up and respond to the critical perspectives\nof others, even if she is unconvinced by their arguments\u201d\n(Westlund 2009, 29). The latter exhibits dialogical autonomy whereas\nthe former does not. (For a critical discussion of Westlund\u2019s\naccount, see Stoljar 2018.) \n\nLike accounts that employ self-regarding attitudes, dialogical\naccounts can be either content-neutral or substantive. Westlund\ncharacterizes her own view as \u201cformal\u201d (i.e.,\ncontent-neutral) because it does not require an agent to endorse or\nreject any specific justificatory practice. Benson\u2019s position,\nhowever, is weakly substantive for the reason that a condition of\nanswerability on his view is that the agent treats herself as\n\u201cproperly\u2026fit and worthy to possess such\nauthority\u201d (Benson 2005b, 117). Indeed, he is skeptical that\nWestlund\u2019s account can maintain its neutrality and contends that\n\u201c[t]o hold oneself answerable, in any concrete situation, is\nto\u2026to be disposed to apply in that situation some normative\nexpectation to oneself\u201d (Benson 2011). However, the different\nproponents of dialogical accounts are in agreement that their position\nis constitutively relational. Westlund explains that the\nautonomy disposition requires \u201cpositioning oneself as always a\npotential member of a reflective or deliberative dyad\u201d so that\nthe psychological perspective of the autonomous agent \u201c[points]\nbeyond itself, to the position the agent occupies as one reflective,\nresponsible self among many\u201d (Westlund 2009, 35). The idea of\nanswerability employs interpersonal relations in the definition of\nautonomy and hence is constitutively relational.\n\nDialogical accounts potentially suffer from the objection that they\nare too weak to capture agents whose autonomy appears to be\ncompromised by oppressive socialization or circumstances. Suppose an\nagent acquiesces in and endorses a set of circumstances or an ideology\nthat is oppressive to her. As Westlund\u2019s account explicitly\nacknowledges, she may nevertheless have the capacity for\nanswerability. In Benson\u2019s terms, she may \u201cregard herself\nas being competent to answer for her conduct in the light of normative\ndemands that, from her point of view, others might appropriately apply\nto her actions\u201d. Consider the eighteen-year-old student who is\nconcerned to uphold dominant beauty standards. In one sense, she may\nlack a sense of self-worth; but on Benson\u2019s notion of the\nself-worth required for free agency, she may exhibit self-worth\nbecause, with respect to the norms she believes to be applicable to\nher, she may regard herself as competent to answer for her actions in\nterms of those norms. She may be engaged in an attempt to enhance her\nsense of self-worth through beauty treatments precisely because she\nbelieves that it is appropriate that the norms of the fashion industry\napply to her (Stoljar 2000, 108). Indeed, when an agent has acquiesced\nin and embraced a set of oppressive norms, she will often have the\nself-confidence required to articulate her commitment to these norms\nto others. Hence, agents who have adopted oppressive practices will\noften be autonomous on dialogical accounts.\n8. Strong Substantive and Social-relational Conceptions\n\nA strong substantive theory of autonomy was defined earlier as one in\nwhich \u201cthe contents of the preferences or values that agents can\nform or act on autonomously are subject to direct normative\nconstraints\u201d (Benson 2005a, 133). On strong substantive\napproaches, certain preferences and values are deemed to be\nincompatible with autonomy, not because of how they are formed, but\nrather because of their content. For example, choosing slavery or\nsubservience would not be autonomous on a strong substantive approach\nbecause the contents of the choices would violate the normative\nconstraints introduced by the theory. The conceptions of autonomy that\nemploy normative competence (\u00a75), self-regarding\nattitudes (\u00a76) and dialogical features (\u00a77)\nshould be distinguished from those in the strong substantive category.\nThese conceptions may \u201cincorporate normative substance\u201d in\ndifferent ways and hence may be weakly substantive (Benson 2005a,\n133). However, none of these approaches invoke direct normative\nconstraints on the content of agents\u2019 preferences as necessary\nconditions of autonomy.\n\nStrong substantive accounts come in various forms. One account\ncharacterizes autonomy as a moral notion: choices with criticizable\nmoral contents are deemed nonautonomous. For example, Thomas\nHill characterizes the failure of autonomy in the case of the\nDeferential Wife as a moral failure of self-respect, a failure to\ntreat oneself as a moral equal (Hill 1991, 15). Agents who choose\nsubservience are nonautonomous because they make a special kind of\nmoral mistake (see also Superson 2005). An alternative proposal says\nthat agents cannot manifest autonomy in a \u201cthick\u201d sense\nunless their choices are consistent with what is objectively in their\ninterests. The Deferential Wife is making a mistake because it is in\nher interests to choose a life of autonomy, rather than a life of\nsubservience. Susan Babbitt notes that \u201cthe effects of\noppression may be such that people are psychologically damaged,\npossessing interests and desires that reflect their subservient\nstatus\u201d (Babbitt 1993, 246). She argues that even if the\nDeferential Wife were a Rawlsian ideal reasoner, making choices under\nideal epistemic conditions\u2014those of \u201cadequate instrumental\nreasoning abilities, full and complete information and the capacity to\nvividly imagine the consequences of her actions\u201d (Babbitt 1993,\n247)\u2014she still would not choose autonomy over deference. Rather,\n\u201cit is part of her social and historical identity to be inferior\nto men\u201d (Babbitt 1993, 250), and hence she would have to undergo\na conversion in her sense of self, so that \u201chabitual servility\nis not what defines it\u201d, to be able to makes the choice that is\nin her objective interest.\n\nStrong substantive accounts are constitutively relational because they\nclaim that preferences are autonomous if and only if their contents\ncorrespond to morally permissible or correct features of the world. A\nrelated constitutively relational conception is exemplified in Marina\nOshana\u2019s \u201csocial-relational\u201d approach in which the\npresence of certain external conditions is necessary for autonomy\n(Oshana 2006). Up until now the theories of autonomy surveyed have\ntreated autonomy as a psychological feature of agents. Procedural\ntheories and Meyers\u2019s competency approach employ psychological\nprocesses of critical reflection. Similarly, normative competence\ntheories rely on an agent\u2019s psychological capacity to discern\nsubstantive norms. Dialogical approaches invoke agents\u2019\npsychological states, such as the sense of one\u2019s own\nanswerability, although they analyze these states as related to\nexternal interpersonal conditions. Strong substantive accounts require\nthat agents\u2019 psychologies hook onto the world in the right ways.\nOn all these positions, in principle, autonomy \u201ccan be\nachieved\u201d by the agent as long as her psychology changes in the\nright way or is aligned in the right way with features of the world.\n(Compare Meyers\u2019s distinction between autonomy as\n\u201csomething a person accomplishes\u201d and autonomy as\n\u201csomething that happens to a person\u201d: Meyers 1987,\n626).\n\nOshana\u2019s social-relational view proposes that autonomy can be\nundermined by conditions in the world that do not necessarily affect\nthe agent\u2019s psychology. Autonomy (or lack of it) is\n\u201csomething that happens\u201d to the agent. Other theorists\nalso invoke external conditions. For instance, Joseph Raz argues that\na woman living on a desert island who is hounded by a wild animal is\nnot capable of autonomy because her options in this situation are so\nseverely curtailed (Raz 1988, 374). And Susan Brison claims that\n\u201cif one has an inadequate range of significant options to choose\nfrom, one\u2019s autonomy is diminished and the extent to which\nsignificant options are available to someone depends on the kind of\nsociety she lives in\u201d (Brison 2000, 285).\n\nOshana\u2019s social-relational analysis is explicit that agents who\nare reflective and psychologically competent can have their autonomy\nundermined by finding themselves in\u2014or deliberately\nadopting\u2014a situation in which their \u201cpractical\ncontrol\u201d is removed: \u201cWe correctly attribute autonomy to a\nperson when the person has de facto power and authority to direct\naffairs of elemental importance to her life within a framework of\nrules (or values, principles, beliefs, pro-attitudes) that she has set\nfor herself\u201d (Oshana 2007, p. 411). For Oshana, no matter the\ndegree of subjective self-realization or subjective endorsement of\ntheir situation, agents living under conditions of severe social\nconstraint have limited autonomy. Consider, for example, serfs living\nunder the protection of the lord of the manor in feudal times. On the\nsocial-relational conception, serfs would be considered lacking in\nautonomy due to a social structure in which the \u201cgeneral and\nroutine\u201d aspects of a serf\u2019s life are not under his or her\nown control but rather under that of the lord of the manor. To the\nextent that agents today live under parallel social conditions, they\nlack or have significantly diminished autonomy. Oshana writes of the\nDeferential Wife that \u201cshe fails to be autonomous\u2014not\nbecause she wants to be subservient, but because she is subservient.\nHer lack of autonomy is due to her personal relations with others and\nto the social institutions of her society\u201d (Oshana 2006, 62).\nSimilarly, Oshana\u2019s example \u201cTaliban Woman\u201d is not\nautonomous because external circumstances deny her practical\ncontrol:\n\nShe is not permitted to support herself financially. She does not have\nlegal custody of her children\u2014that remains in the hands of their\nfather and in his male relatives should he die. She has no voice in\nthe manner and duration of any schooling that her children,\nparticularly her daughters, may receive. She must remain costumed in\ncumbersome garb\u2014a burqa\u2014when in public. She cannot travel\nunless accompanied by a male relative\u2026and can travel only when\ngranted permission by a male relative or religious elder. She knows\nthat any transgression, any show of independence counts as heretical\ndefiance and invites punishment both swift and harsh. (Oshana 2006,\n60)\n\n\nAccording to Oshana, the external conditions to which this woman is\nsubjected render her passive and her \u201clife-plan remains in force\n[only] because of the will of another\u201d (Oshana 2006, 62). Even\nif the woman endorses the situation she is in, she lacks de\nfacto control over routine aspects of daily life and hence cannot\nbe autonomous.\n\nOshana\u2019s conception of autonomy should be distinguished from the\nstrong substantive views identified above: on her approach, the\ncontents of preferences and conceptions of the good are irrelevant to\nautonomy. Agents may have autonomy-promoting conceptions of the good,\nyet may fail to be autonomous because constraining external conditions\nrule it out. Moreover, the converse case is also true. Consider a\nnewly liberated prisoner who we will suppose satisfies the rational\ncompetency conditions that are also necessary for autonomy on\nOshana\u2019s account (Oshana 2007, p. 419). For Oshana, once the\nprisoner is released into autonomy-compatible external conditions, he\nis autonomous despite the content of his desires. The prisoner may\nprefer to return to prison, yet this preference will not nullify his\nautonomy. Although an agent may desire to be directed by the will of\nanother, it is only if she is actually in the external\nconditions in which she is so directed that her autonomy is impeded.\nThus, Oshana\u2019s conception is in a sense content-neutral.\n\nThere is an additional sense in which the social-relational conception\ndiffers from other conceptions of autonomy: it is \u201cglobal\u201d\nnot \u201clocal\u201d. Oshana\u2019s theory provides an analysis of\nthe condition of the autonomous agent rather than the conditions under\nwhich an agent\u2019s particular desires and preferences at\nparticular times count as autonomous. This means that agents\n\u2014for example, those living under conditions of slavery\u2014\ncould lack global autonomy but nevertheless have local autonomy with\nrespect to particular preferences and desires. A question arises then\nabout the relationship between local and global autonomy.\n\nStrong substantive and social-relational approaches are perhaps the\nmost controversial of those surveyed and have as a result attracted\ntrenchant critiques. The first is conceptual. It has been suggested\nthat strong substantive theories conflate autonomy (defined as\nself-rule) with morally right-rule (Benson 2005a,\n132). In other words, on these accounts, agents are autonomous\nonly if they make morally correct choices or choices that\ncoincide with their objective interests. But, it is argued, being\nautonomous is not conceptually identical to being moral, or to always\nacting in ways that promote an agent\u2019s interests. Second, it has\nbeen suggested that social-relational views are objectionable because\nthey permit paternalism or are implicitly committed to perfectionism\n(Holroyd 2009; Christman 2004; cf. Mackenzie 2008; Stoljar 2017). For\nexample, Christman argues that Oshana\u2019s position is implicitly\ncommitted to an egalitarian ideal; he claims that on her account, no\nother political arrangement is consistent with personal autonomy\n(Christman 2004; Christman 2009). Third, it has been alleged that\nthese accounts are too quick to treat oppression as always impeding\nautonomy. For instance, Meyers claims that certain agents are\n\u201cfirebrand, adventure-loving resisters\u201d, who thrive and\nflourish when they have the opportunity to oppose social norms (Meyers\n2000a, 479). If this is so, autonomy would be possible even in the\ncircumstances of the extremely constraining regime described by\nOshana. Catriona Mackenzie has recently argued that autonomy is a\nmulti-dimensional concept, and that the different conceptions of\nautonomy surveyed here correspond to different dimensions of the\nconcept, namely self-determination, self-governance,\nand self-authorization (Mackenzie 2014; Mackenzie 2015).\nOshana\u2019s social-relational approach provides an account of\nself-determination because it identifies the external\n\u201copportunities necessary to make and enact decisions of\npractical import to one\u2019s life\u201d (Mackenzie 2015, 55). The\nprocedural approaches of Meyers and Friedman fall under the dimension\nof self-governance because of their focus on the \u201cskills and\ncapacities necessary to make and enact decisions and to live one\u2019s\nlife\u201d (Mackenzie 2015, 55). And dialogical theories of autonomy\nthat employ answerability correspond to the dimension of\nself-authorization, which \u201cinvolves regarding oneself as having\nthe normative authority to be self-determining and\nself-governing\u201d (Mackenzie 2015, 55). Mackenzie\u2019s\nmulti-dimensional approach illuminates the different concerns of\nrelational autonomy theorists, but raises further questions. How do\nthe three dimensions of autonomy intersect? Are any or all of the\ndifferent dimensions necessary or sufficient conditions of autonomy?\nIs it possible for an agent to be fully autonomous is she satisfies\nonly one dimension of autonomy?\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nFeminist theories of autonomy analyze the effects of internalized\noppression and the circumstances of oppression on agents\u2019 global\nand local autonomy. There is no consensus as to which theoretical\nposition is correct. To some extent, the answer depends on intuitions\nabout which view best captures the notion of agency that is\none\u2019s own. There is considerable consensus, however,\nthat oppressive socialization and oppressive practices diminish\nautonomy and perhaps undermine it altogether. The relational\nconceptions of autonomy surveyed here are important contributions to\ntheoretical debates on the nature of autonomy as well as to our\nunderstanding of how oppression interferes with the psychological\nstates and social conditions required for autonomy.",
