Clearly, a list of examples for\neach category would be a heuristically promising start in the search\nfor some criterion (or list of criteria) that would be fruitful for\ndrawing the distinction. However, a simple list would be of limited\nsignificance since there are too many ways of extrapolating from the\nparadigm cases to a distinction that would cover the unclear cases,\nwith the result that no clear notion has been explained.\n\nFor example, pure sets are paradigm examples of abstract entities. But\nthe case of impure sets is far from clear. Consider the unit set whose\nsole member is Joe Biden (i.e., {Joe Biden}), the Undergraduate Class\nof 2020 or The Ethics Committee, etc. They are sets, but it is not\nclear that they are abstract given that Joe Biden, the members of the\nclass and committee are concrete. Similarly, if one offers the\ncharacters of Sherlock Holmes stories as examples to help motivate the\nprimitive concept abstract object, then one has to wonder about the\nobject London that appears in the novels.\n\nThe refusal to characterize the abstract/concrete distinction while\nmaintaining that both categories have instances might be called the\nway of primitivism, whenever the following condition obtains:\na few predicates are distinguished as primitive and unanalyzable, and\nthe explanatory power rests on the fact that other interesting\npredicates can be defined in terms of the primitives and that\ninteresting claims can be judged true on the basis of our intuitive\nunderstanding of the primitive and defined notions. Thus, one might\ntake abstract and concrete as primitive notions. It wouldn\u2019t be\nan insignificant result if one could use this strategy to explain why\nabstract objects are necessarily existent, causally ineffiacious,\nnon-spatiotemporal, intersubjective, etc. (see Cowling 2017:\n92\u201397).\n\nBut closer inspection of this method reveals some significant\nconcerns. To start with, when a distinction is taken as basic and\nunanalyzable, one typically has to offer some intuitive instances of\nthe primitive predicates. But it is not always so easy to do this. For\nexample, when mathematicians take set and membership\nas primitives and then assert some principles of set theory, they\noften illustrate their primitives by offering some examples of sets,\nsuch as The Undergraduate Class of 2020 or The Ethics Committee, etc.\nBut these, of course, aren\u2019t quite right, since the members of\nthe class and committee may change while the class and committee\nremain the same, whereas if the members of a set change, one has a\ndifferent set. A similar concern affects the present proposal. If one\noffers sets or the characters of the Sherlock Holmes novels as\nexamples to help motivate the primitive concept abstract\nobject, then one has to wonder about impure sets such as the unit\nset whose sole member is Aristotle (i.e., \\(\\{\\textrm{Aristotle}\\}\\))\nand the object London that appears in the novels.\n",
