    "main_text": "Later Developments || Modern, Renaissance, and Nineteenth Centuries\n6. Strawson\u2019s Defense\n\n\nIn the twentieth century there were many creative uses of logical\ntools and techniques in reassessing past doctrines. One might\nnaturally wonder if there is some ingenious interpretation of the\nsquare that attributes existential import to the O\nform and makes sense of it all without forbidding empty or\nuniversal terms, thus reconciling traditional doctrine with modern\nviews. Peter Geach, 1970, 62\u201364, shows that this can be done\nusing an unnatural interpretation. Peter Strawson, 1952, 176\u201378,\nhad a more ambitious goal. Strawson\u2019s idea was to justify the square\nby adopting a nonclassical view of truth of statements, and by\nredefining the logical relation of validity. First, he suggested, we\nneed to suppose that a proposition whose subject term is empty is\nneither true nor false, but lacks truth value altogether.  Then we say\nthat Q entails R just in case there are no instances\nof Q and R such that the instance of Q is\ntrue and the instance of R is false. For example, the\nA form \u2018Every S is P\u2019\nentails the I form \u2018Some S is\nP\u2019 because there is no instance of the\nA form that is true when the corresponding instance\nof the I form is false. The troublesome cases\ninvolving empty terms turn out to be instances in which one or both\nforms lack truth value, and these are irrelevant so far as entailment\nis concerned. With this revised account of entailment, all of the\n\u201ctraditional\u201d logical relations result, if they are worded as follows:\n\n\n\nContradictories:\nThe A and O forms\nentail each other\u2019s negations, as do the E and\nI forms. The negation of the A form\nentails the (unnegated) O form, and vice versa;\nlikewise for the E and I forms.\n\n\nContraries:\nThe A and E forms\nentail each other\u2019s negations\n\n\nSubcontraries:\nThe negation of the I form entails the\n(unnegated) O form, and vice versa.\n\n\nSubalternation:\nThe A form entails the I\nform, and the E form entails the O form.\n\n\nConverses:\nThe E and I forms each\nentail their own converses.\n\n\nContraposition:\nThe A and O forms each\nentail their own contrapositives.\n\n\nObverses:\nEach form entails its own obverse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese doctrines are not, however, the doctrines of [SQUARE]. The\ndoctrines of [SQUARE] are worded entirely in terms of the possibilities\nof truth values, not in terms of entailment. So \u201centailment\u201d is\nirrelevant to [SQUARE]. It turns out that Strawson\u2019s revision of truth\nconditions does preserve the principles of SQUARE (these can\neasily be checked by\n cases),[27]\n but not the additional conversion principles of [SQUARE], and also\nnot the traditional principles of contraposition or obversion. For\nexample, Strawson\u2019s reinterpreted version of conversion holds for the\nI form because any I form\nproposition entails its own converse: if \u2018Some A is\nB\u2019 and \u2018Some B is A\u2019 both\nhave truth value, then neither has an empty subject term, and so if\nneither lack truth value and if either is true the other will be true\nas well. But the original doctrine of conversion says that an\nI form and its converse always have the same truth value, and\nthat is false on Strawson\u2019s account; if there are As but no\nBs, then \u2018Some A is B\u2019 is false\nand \u2018Some B is A\u2019 has no truth value at\nall. Similar results follow for contraposition and obversion.\n\n\nThe \u201ctraditional logic\u201d that Strawson discusses is much closer to\nthat of nineteenth century logic texts than it is to the version that\nheld sway for two millennia before\n that.[28]\n But even though he\nliterally salvages a version of nineteenth century logic, the view he\nsaves is unable to serve the purposes for which logical principles are\nformulated, as was pointed out by Timothy Smiley in a short note in\nMind in\n 1967.[29]\n People have always taken the square to\nembody principles by which one can reason, and by which one can\nconstruct extended chains of reasoning. But if you string together\nStrawson\u2019s entailments you can infer falsehoods from truths, something\nthat nobody in any tradition would consider legitimate. For example,\nbegin with this truth (the subject term is non-empty):\nNo man is a chimera.\n\n\nBy conversion, we get: \nNo chimera is a man.\n\n\nBy obversion: \nEvery chimera is a non-man.\n\n\nBy subalternation: \nSome chimera is a non-man.\n\n\nBy conversion: \nSome non-man is a chimera.\n\n\nSince there are non-men, the conclusion is not truth-valueless, and\nsince there are no chimeras it is false. Thus we have passed from a\ntrue claim to a false one. (The example does not even involve the\nproblematic O form.) All steps are validated by\nStrawson\u2019s doctrine. So Strawson reaches his goal of preserving\ncertain patterns commonly identified as constituting traditional\nlogic, but at the cost of sacrificing the application of logic to\nextended reasoning.\n",
