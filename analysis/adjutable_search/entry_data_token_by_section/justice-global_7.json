    "main_text": "Principles to Guide Behavior in International and Global Matters || Human Rights Fulfillment\n2.4 Human Rights Fulfillment\n\nDiscussion of global justice matters often invokes concern for human\nrights. In fact, for all their differences, both nationalists and\ncosmopolitans frequently agree that a good way to think about some of\nour duties to one another is via human rights. Human rights can and do\ntherefore serve as an important discourse for furthering discussion\nabout our global responsibilities.\n\nRespecting human rights is an important requirement in much\ninternational law and can be a key criterion in evaluating whether\ngovernments are considered legitimate by the international community.\nThe United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a highly\ninfluential account of all human beings\u2019 basic entitlements and\nthis document often plays an important role in real world debates\nabout justice matters. See the comprehensive entry on\n human rights\n for more detail. Here we have space to discuss only two issues that\nhave been prominent in debates about global justice.\n\nThe first concerns the kinds of duties we have in relation to human\nrights. Against a conventional view widespread before 1980, Henry Shue\nargues that if rights to physical security are basic, so are rights to\nsubsistence (Shue 1980). A careful analysis of the duties associated\nwith human rights indicates that the commonly held distinction between\npositive and negative duties cannot be maintained. All rights have a\nrange of both positive and negative duties associated with them.\n\nThe second prominent issue concerns whether our failures in relation\nto fulfilling human rights amount to rights violations. Thomas Pogge\n(2008) offers an influential account of duties with respect to human\nrights. Our current global order perpetuates global poverty on a\nmassive scale, but since feasible reforms to that order could avert\nthis harm, our failure to make reforms not only implicates us in the\nmisery but also in the violation of the rights of the\n poor.[3]\n We therefore have extensive obligations to reform our global order so\nthat the rights of the poor can be fulfilled.\n\nMany theorists have done important work on a range of issues\nconcerning human rights and international obligations (Buchanan 2004;\nHessler 2005; Nickel 2007; Beitz 2009; Holder and Reidy 2013; Song\n2019). Theorists have also focused attention on particular rights,\nprominently the right to health (Wolff 2013). Some important questions\ninclude: What are human rights\u2019 grounds or can they be defined\nby their functions? Are human rights properly moral or\npolitical/legal? Does respect for rights conflict with community\nobligations or respect for culture? What is the proper role of human\nrights in morality, law, and policy? How should we best understand the\nnormative implications of our contemporary human rights practice?\n(Wolff 2013; Cruft, Liao, and Renzo 2015; Gilabert 2019; Etinson 2018;\nO\u2019Neill 2005; Beitz 2009; Brock 2023).\n\nFor more treatment of issues, especially concerning what human rights\nare, which rights are rightly construed as human rights, and how human\nrights function in international law, see the entry on\n human rights.\n",
