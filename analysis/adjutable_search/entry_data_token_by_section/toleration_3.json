    "main_text": "Justifying Toleration\n4. Justifying Toleration\n\nMany of the systematic arguments for toleration\u2014be they\nreligious, pragmatic, moral or epistemological\u2014can be used as a\njustification for more than one of the conceptions of toleration\nmentioned above (section 2). The classic argument for freedom of\nconscience, for example, has been used to justify arrangements\naccording to the \u201cpermission conception\u201d as well as the\n\u201crespect conception.\u201d Generally speaking, relations of\ntoleration are hierarchically ordered according to the first\nconception, quite unstable according to the conception of\n\u201ccoexistence,\u201d while the \u201cesteem conception\u201d\nis the most demanding in terms of the kind of mutual appreciation\nbetween the tolerating parties. In each case, the limits of toleration\nseem either arbitrary or too narrow, as in the esteem conception,\nwhich only allows toleration of those beliefs and practices that can\nbe ethically valued.\n\nAccordingly, in current philosophical discussions of toleration in\nmulticultural, modern societies, the \u201crespect conception\u201d\nis often seen as the most appropriate and promising. Yet in these\ndiscussions, toleration as \u201crespect\u201d can be justified in\ndifferent ways. An ethical-liberal, neo-Lockean justification argues\nthat respect is owed to individuals as personally and ethically\nautonomous beings with the capacity to choose, possibly revise and\nrealize an individual conception of the good. This capacity is to be\nrespected and furthered because it is seen as a necessary (though not\nsufficient) condition for attaining the good life (cf. Kymlicka 1995).\nHence the argument presupposes a specific thesis about the good\nlife\u2014i.e., that only an autonomously chosen way of life can be a\ngood life\u2014which can, however, reasonably be questioned. One may\ndoubt whether such a way of life will necessarily be subjectively more\nfulfilling or objectively more valuable than one adopted in a more\ntraditional way, without the presence of a range of options to choose\nfrom. Apart from that, the ethical-liberal theory could lead to a\nperfectionist justification of policies designed to further individual\nautonomy that could have a paternalistic character and lack toleration\nfor non-liberal ways of life. In other words, there is the danger of\nan insufficient distinction between the components of objection and\nrejection mentioned above (section 1).\n\nThus, an alternative, neo-Baylean justification of the respect\nconception seeks to avoid a particular conception of the good life,\nrelying instead on the discursive principle of justification which\nsays that every norm that is to be binding for a plurality of persons,\nespecially norms that are the basis of legal coercion, must be\njustifiable with reasons that are reciprocally acceptable to all\naffected as free and equal persons. Such persons have a basic\n\u201cright to justification\u201d (Forst 2012a) which gives them\nthe power to reject one-sided ethical or religious justifications for\ngeneral norms. For a complete argument for toleration, however, this\nnormative component has to be accompanied by an epistemological\ncomponent which says that ethical or religious reasons, if\nreciprocally contested, cannot be sufficient to justify the exercise\nof force, since their validation depends on a particular faith that\ncan reasonably be rejected by others who do not share it; its validity\nreaches into a realm \u201cbeyond reason,\u201d as Bayle said (see\nalso similar arguments by Rawls 1993, ch. 2, and Larmore 1996, ch. 7).\nThus toleration consists of the insight that reasons of ethical\nobjection, even if deeply held, cannot be valid as general\nreasons of rejection so long as they are reciprocally\nrejectable as belonging to a conception of the good or true way of\nlife that is not and need not be shareable. While such a distinction\nbetween ethical reasons for objection and stronger, morally\njustifiable reasons for rejection tries to overcome the \u201cparadox\nof moral tolerance\u201d (see section 1 above), the \u201cparadox of\ndrawing the limits\u201d would be solved by seeing as tolerable all\nsuch views or practices that do not violate the principle of\njustification itself (see Forst 2013).\n\nWith such a reflexive turn in the debate about toleration, a number of\nquestions arise as to the alleged superior validity of the principle\nof justification and the plausibility of a neo-Baylean epistemology\ndistinguishing between faith and knowledge. Can there be an impartial\njustification that is not in the same way a \u201cparty\u201d to the\ncontest of ethical truths and world-views? Might there be the\npossibility, using a phrase John Rawls (1993) coined in the context of\nhis theory of justice, of a \u201ctolerant\u201d theory of\ntoleration that is at the same time substantive enough to ground and\nlimit toleration?\n",
