Chomsky\u2019s 2000 cautions mentioned in\n footnote 10)?\n Is it really true that in the \u201cpale grey lore\u201d of all the\nsentences we accept, there aren\u2019t some that are\n\u201cwhite\u201d somehow \u201cby virtue of the very meanings of\ntheir words\u201d? What about our examples in our earlier set II?\nWhat about sentences of the sort that interest Juhl and Loomis (2010)\nthat merely link patent synonyms, as in \u201cLawyers are\nattorneys,\u201d or \u201cA fortnight is a period of fourteen\ndays\u201d? As Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975])\npointed out, it is unlikely that so intuitively plausible a\ndistinction should turn out to have no basis at all in\nfact.\n\nQuine addressed this issue, first, in his (1953 [1980a], chapter 3),\nand then in a much larger way in his (1960, chapter 2, and 1974) and\nrelated articles. In his (1953 [1980a]) he pressed his objection to\nanalyticity further to the very ideas of synonymy and the linguistic\nmeaning of an expression, on which, we saw, Frege\u2019s criterion of\nanalyticity crucially relied. His objection is that he sees no way to\nmake any serious explanatory sense of them. He explored plausible\nexplanations in terms of \u201cdefinition,\u201d\n\u201cintension,\u201d \u201cpossibility,\u201d and\n\u201ccontradiction,\u201d, pointing out that each of these notions\nseems to stand in precisely as much need of explanation as synonymy\nitself (recall our observation in \u00a71.2 above regarding the lack\nof any formal contradiction in \u201cSome pediatricans\naren\u2019t doctors\u201d). The terms seem to be mutually definable\nin what seems to be a\u2014viciously?\u2014small \u201cclosed curve\nin space\u201d (Quine 1953 [1980a], p. 30). Though they might be\ninvoked to explain one another, they could not in the end answer the\nchallenge of how to distinguish an analytic claim from simply a\ntenaciously held belief.\n\nTo take a recent example, David Chalmers (2012) revisits\nCarnap\u2019s (1956b) proposal for basing synonymy on\n\u201cintension\u201d by way of eliciting a person\u2019s judgments\nabout the extension of a term/concept in all possible\n worlds:[14]\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s key idea is that we can investigate the intension that\na subject associated with an expression by investigating the\nsubject\u2019s judgments about possible cases. To determine the\nintension of an expression such as \u2018Pferd\u2019 for a subject,\nwe present the subject with descriptions of various logically possible\ncases, and we ask the subject whether he or she is willing to apply\nthe term \u2018Pferd\u2019 to objects specified in these cases. If\nwe do this for enough cases, then we can test all sorts of hypotheses\nabout the intension of the expression. (Chalmers 2012, p. 204)\n\n\nBut how are the informants to understand the questions they\u2019re\nbeing asked? If they understand the term \u201cpossible\u201d as\nlogicians do, as truth in a set-theoretically specified\nmodel, then it will be too weak: there are obviously models in\nwhich synonymous expressions e.g., \u201chorse\u201d and\n\u201cPferd,\u201d or \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cunmarried\nmale\u201d are assigned non-overlapping sets (cf. Quine\n[1953 [1980a], pp. 22\u20133), so that it\u2019s logically possible\nfor there be a horse that\u2019s not a Pferd, or a bachelor\nthat\u2019s married (again, \u201ca married bachelor\u201d is\nformally contradictory only if one substitutes synonyms for synonyms;\nbut we certainly can\u2019t appeal to synonymy in trying to\ndefine synonymy). But if \u201cpossible\u201d is understood\n(as it ordinarily would be) as merely imaginable, then it\nwill be far too strong, ruling out ideas that the scientifically\nunder-informed might find impossible, e.g., curved space-time,\nsomething having the properties of both waves and particles, or\ncompletely unconscious thoughts (which, at least, e.g., John Searle\n1992, pp. 155\u20136, and Galen Strawson 1994, pp. 166\u20137 report\nhaving trouble conceiving). As Quine (1953 [1980a]) famously argued,\nsuch appeals to informant verdicts will only work if the informants\nunderstand the questions as about the very terms the proposed test\nis supposed to define, viz., \u201cpossible\u201d as\nconstrained by synonymy or preservation of meaning. Although, as many\nhave noted (e.g., Williamson 2007, p. 50), there may be explanatory\ncircularities in the best of theories, the circularity here seems\nparticularly vicious, with the relevant ideas appearing not to perform\nany explanatory work other than bringing in each other\u2019s\nlaundry.\n\nWhy was Quine so convinced of this last claim? Because he thought it\nwas possible to provide a satisfactory explanation of human language\nwithout them, indeed, without any mentalistic notions at all. In his\n(1953 [1980b], 1960 [2013] and 1974) he sketched a behavioristic\ntheory of language that doesn\u2019t rely on the postulation of\ndeterminate meaning or reference, and argued that, indeed, translation\nis \u201cindeterminate\u201d: there is \u201cno fact of the\nmatter\u201d about whether two expressions do or do not have the same\nmeaning (see Indeterminacy of Translation). This would appear\nto imply that there are pretty much no facts of the matter about\npeople\u2019s mental lives at all! For, if there is no fact of the\nmatter about whether two people mean the same thing by their words,\nthen there is no fact of the matter about the content of\nanyone\u2019s thoughts. Quine himself took this consequence in\nstride\u2014he was, after all, a behaviorist\u2013 regarding it as\n\u201cof a piece\u201d with Franz Brentano\u2019s (1874 [1995])\nfamous thesis of the \u201cirreducibility of the intentional\u201d;\nit\u2019s just that for him, unlike for Brentano, it simply showed\nthe \u201cbaselessness of intentional idioms and the emptiness of a\nscience of intention\u201d (1960 [2013], p. 202). Needless to say,\nmany subsequent philosophers have not been happy with this view, and\nhave wondered where Quine\u2019s argument went wrong.\n",
