    "preamble": "\n\nThought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They are\nemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,\nconceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,\ntheory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversial\nthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve to\nillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used in\neducational contexts. The situation is different, however, with\nrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigate\nreality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,\ntables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and even\ndivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attracts\nmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.\nSignificant is the overlap here with many other central philosophical\ntopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance of\nunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition in\nhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.\nMoreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two important\nrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers study them as a research\ntopic, but also historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc.\nSecondly, they are used in many disciplines, including biology,\neconomics, history, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,\ninterestingly, not with the same frequency in each).\n\nMost often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,\nfrequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between the\nimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on the\none hand, and the narratives that establish those scenarios in\npeople\u2019s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it may\nassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative power\nof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain that\nactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion of\nan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should be\ndistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imagining\nany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and from\npsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be some\noverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactual\nreasoning in general, as they seem to require a palpable element,\nwhich explains the impression that something is experienced in a\nthought experiment (i.e., being seen, felt, heard, etc.; not\nliterally, of course). In other words, though many call any\ncounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,\ne.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing.\n\nIt is a quite different matter as to whether there is a logical\nstructure common to all of thought experiments. Based on such\nconsiderations of logical structure, a taxonomy has been proposed\naccording to which all thought experiments fall into two classes:\n\u201cNecessity Refuters\u201d and \u201cPossibility\nRefuters\u201d (see Sorensen 1992, 132\u2013160). Such proposals\nespecially fuel the debate about identity conditions of thought\nexperiments. What modifications to logical structure does a thought\nexperiment tolerate before it ceases to exist and a new one is born?\nIn other words, how much emphasis on propositional characteristics is\nappropriate in the analysis of thought experiments?\n\nLooking at the development of the discussion about thought experiments\nover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experiments\nwere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and the\nphilosophy of philosophy (\u201cmetaphilosophy\u201d), before the\nscope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for that\npath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simple\nepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerful\nmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science has\nto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world by\nvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can we\nlearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking? This is the\ncentral question. Are there really thought experiments that enable us\nto acquire new knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If\nso, where does the new information come from, assuming that it takes\nnew information to learn anything new about the world by means of\nthought experiments? Finally, how can we distinguish good from bad\ninstances of thought experiments? These questions seem urgent with\nrespect to scientific thought experiments, because many\n\u201crecognize them as an occasionally potent tool for increasing\nour understanding of nature\u201d (Kuhn 1977, p. 241).\n\u201cHistorically their role is very close to the double one played\nby actual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thought\nexperiments can disclose nature\u2019s failure to conform to a\npreviously held set of expectations. Second, they can suggest\nparticular ways in which both expectation and theory must henceforth\nbe revised\u201d (Kuhn 1977, p. 261). Yet, questions surrounding the\nepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experiments\npose, are equally urgent with respect to thought experiments outside\nof the natural sciences. This is especially true with respect to\nphilosophy itself. Philosophy offers numerous examples of thought\nexperiments that play a role similar in importance to some scientific\nthought experiments. And this fact provokes in turn further inquiries\ninto the relationship between the natural sciences and philosophy,\nespecially with respect to phenomena that implicate both the natural\nsciences and philosophy, such as the mind and free will (see, e.g.,\nWilkes 1988; Young 2013).\n\nIf scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then the\nquestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology to\nbe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is often\noffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may be\nsubjected to further empirical testing. Obviously, this can\u2019t be\ndone for philosophical thought experiments. But, it seems difficult to\naccept a categorical separation of science and philosophy along these\nlines. The 17th century saw some of the most brilliant practitioners\nof thought experimentation in Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz,\nall of whom pursued the project of \u201cnatural philosophy.\u201d\nAnd in our own time, the creation of quantum mechanics and relativity\nare almost unthinkable without the crucial role played by thought\nexperiments, most of which relate to important philosophical issues\nthat arise from these scientific theories. Besides, much of ethics,\nphilosophy of language, and philosophy of mind is based on the results\nof thought experiments in a way that seems very similar to scientific\nthought experiments (though some might contest this), including\nSearle\u2019s Chinese room, Putnam\u2019s twin earth, and\nJackson\u2019s Mary the colour scientist. Philosophy, even more than\nthe sciences, would be severely impoverished without thought\nexperiments. These observations partly explain why it has been argued\nthat a more \u201cunified\u201d account of thought experiments is\ndesirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005, pp. 329\u2013330;\nG\u00e4hde 2000). Of course, it is important not to downplay the\nsignificant differences between the sciences and philosophy. But an\naccount of thought experiments seems more powerful if it can do\njustice to the fact that not only in the sciences we find many of\nthem.\n\nThere have been several attempts to define \u201cthought\nexperiment\u201d along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis\n(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better to\nleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the\nongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what\nthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (see\nH\u00e4ggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to begin\nwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficient\nconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal with\nremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,\nreligion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to refer\nto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well as\nthose already mentioned, there are Newton\u2019s bucket,\nHeisenberg\u2019s gamma-ray microscope, Einstein\u2019s elevator,\nLeibniz\u2019s mill, Parfit\u2019s people who split like amoebas,\nand Thomson\u2019s violinist. Everyone is probably familiar with some\nof these. Less familiar thought experiments include the mouse that\nbreaks into the tabernacle of a medieval Roman Catholic Church\nbuilding to feed on the consecrated wafers kept in there (see Fehige\n2018). Roman Catholic Christians believe that a consecrated wafer is\nthe \u201cbody of Christ\u201d. The \u201csubstance\u201d of the\nwafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed to\nbe replaced. In its place is the \u201csubstance\u201d of\nChrist\u2019s body after consecration by a priest. Only the\nAristotelian \u201caccidents\u201d of the wafer remain intact\n(smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eat the \u201cbody of\nChrist\u201d (if any human actually does)? If not, then the\n\u201cbody of Christ\u201d seems to be less than an objective\nreality; if yes, the \u201cbody of Christ\u201d must be able to do\ngood in the absence of a believing human soul. Another example less\nknown is \u201cthe dome\u201d thought experiment, which is to prove\nindeterminism in Newtonian physics. Imagine a mass sitting on a\nradially symmetric surface in a gravitational field. Guided by\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion one comes to realize that the mass can\neither remain at rest for all times, or spontaneously move in an\narbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). This thought experiment\ntriggers a number of very interesting questions concerning the nature\nof Newtonian theory, the meaning of \u201cphysical\u201d, and the\nrole of idealizations in physics. And, of course, does it show what it\nclaims? (see Malament 2008).\n\nThis entry continues with an overview of the characteristics of\nthought experiments in light of examples in Section 1. Section 2\nreviews several taxonomies for classfying thought experiments and\nSection 3 sketches a history of philosophical inquiry into the nature\nof thought experiments. Section 4 covers several views representing\nthe current state of the debate. The entry concludes by highlighting\nsome trends in discussions surrounding the so-called laboratory of the\nmind.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Important Characteristics of Thought Experiments\n\nTheorizing about thought experiments usually turns on the details or\nthe patterns of specific cases. Familiarity with a wide range of\nexamples is crucial for commentators, and the list is very long (see,\ne.g., Stuart et al. 2018, pp. 558\u2013560) We will provide a few\nhere. One of the most beautiful early instances (found in Lucretius,\nDe Rerum Natura 1.951\u2013987; see Bailey 1950, pp.\n58\u201359) attempts to show that space is infinite: if there is a\npurported boundary to the universe, we can toss a spear at it. If the\nspear flies through, it isn\u2019t a boundary after all; if the spear\nbounces back, then there must be something beyond the supposed edge of\nspace, a cosmic wall that stopped the spear, a wall that is itself in\nspace. Either way, there is no edge of the universe; thus, space must\nbe infinite.\n\nThis example nicely illustrates many of the most common features of\nwhat it means to engage in the conduct of thought experiments: we\nvisualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we\nlet it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally,\nwe draw a conclusion. The example also illustrates the fallibility of\nthought experiments. Since the time of Lucretius, we\u2019ve learned\nhow to conceptualize space so that it could be both finite and\nunbounded. Imagine a circle, which is a one-dimensional space. As we\nmove around, there is no edge, but it is nevertheless finite. The\nuniverse might be a three-dimensional version of this topology. It is,\ntherefore, true that we must try to be mindful of unexpected\nlimitations due to \u201cphysical scale effects\u201d (Klee 2008),\nor other such things, when imagining counterfactual scenarios.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \u201cWelcome to the edge of\nthe Universe\u201d\n\n\nOften a real experiment that is meant to be the analogue of a thought\nexperiment is impossible to be carried out as such due to physical,\ntechnological, ethical, or financial limitations (see, e.g., Sorensen\n1992, pp. 200\u2013202); but physical unrealizability needn\u2019t\nbe a defining condition of thought experiments. Rather, the main point\nis that we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking, and\ntherein lies the great interest for philosophy. That was the position\nof Ernst Mach (see Mach, 1897 and 1905; for a most instructive\nassessments of his views see K\u00fchne 2006, pp. 165\u2013202, and\nSorensen 1992, pp. 51\u201375). Thought experiments are on a spectrum\nof different kinds of experiments. They allow us to tap into a great\nstore of \u201cinstinctive knowledge\u201d picked up from past\nexperience. We will get back to Mach\u2019s theory further down. His\naccount of thought experiments remains one of the major theories of\nhow thought experiments work. One of Mach\u2019s favourite examples\nis due to Simon Stevin (see Mach, 1883, pp. 48\u201358). When a chain\nis draped over a double frictionless plane, as in Fig. 2a, how will it\nmove? Add some links as in Fig. 2b. Now it is obvious. The initial\nsetup must have been in static equilibrium. Otherwise, we would have a\nperpetual motion machine; and according to our experience-based\n\u201cinstinctive knowledge,\u201d says Mach, this is impossible. We\ndo not have to perform the experiment in the real world, which we\ncould not do, anyway, since it would require a perfectly frictionless\nplane. Nevertheless the outcome seems compelling.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 2. \u201cHow will it\nmove?\u201d\n\n\nJudith Thomson provided one of the most striking and effective thought\nexperiments in the moral realm (see Thomson 1971). Her example is\naimed at a popular anti-abortion argument that goes something like\nthis: A fetus is an innocent person. All innocent persons have a right\nto life. Abortion results in the death of a fetus. Therefore, abortion\nis morally wrong. In her thought experiment, Thomson asks you to\nimagine a famous violinist falling into a coma. The society of music\nlovers determines from medical records that you and you alone can save\nthe violinist\u2019s life by being hooked up to him for nine months.\nThe music lovers break into your home while you are asleep and hook\nthe unconscious (and unknowing, hence innocent) violinist to you. You\nmay want to unhook him, but you are then faced with the following\nargument put forward by the music lovers: The violinist is an innocent\nperson. All innocent persons have a right to life. Unhooking him will\nresult in his death. Therefore, unhooking him is morally wrong.\nHowever, the argument, even though it has the same structure as the\nanti-abortion argument, does not seem convincing in this case. You\nwould be very generous to remain attached for nine months, but you are\nnot morally obligated to do so. The parallel with the abortion case is\nevident. Thomson\u2019s thought experiment is effective in\ndistinguishing two concepts that had previously been run together:\n\u201cright to life\u201d and \u201cright to what is needed to\nsustain life.\u201d The fetus and the violinist might each have the\nformer, but it is not evident that either has the latter. The upshot\nis that even if the fetus has a right to life (which Thomson does not\nbelieve but allows for the sake of the argument), it may still be\nmorally permissible to abort. Those opposed to Thomson\u2019s view\nhave two options. They can either dismiss her thought experiment as a\nuseless fiction. In fact, thought experiments as a method in ethics\nhave their critics (see, e.g., Dancy 1985). Alternatively, they can\nprovide a different version of the same scenario to challenge the\nconclusion. It is a very intriguing feature of thought experiments\nthat they can be \u201crethought\u201d (see Bokulich 2001). Real\nexperiments are frequently open to reinterpretation, too. In this\nrespect there does not seem to be a principled difference between the\ntwo classes of experiments.\n\nLike arguments, thought experiments can be criticized in different\nways. Perhaps the set up is faulty; perhaps the conclusions drawn from\nthe thought experiment are not justified. Similar criticisms can arise\nin real experiments. Counter thought experiments are perhaps another\nform of criticism. They do not target the premises or conclusions\ninvolved in a particular thought experiment but question the\nphenomenon, i.e. the non-propositional heart of an imagined scenario\n(see Brown 2007). For example, Daniel Dennett is convinced that Frank\nJackson\u2019s Mary thought experiment is poor evidence to oppose\nphysicalism in philosophy of mind. In Jackson\u2019s version, Mary,\nwho knows everything physics and the neurosciences can possibly know\nabout colours but grew up in a colourless environment (seeing only\nblack, white and grey things), allegedly learns something new when she\nsees a red tomato for the first time. Now she knows what it is like to\nexperience red. This is an argument for qualia as something over and\nabove the physical. Instead of a red tomato, Dennett, in his version\nof the thought experiment, presents Mary with a bright blue banana. In\nhis version of the story (which seems just as plausible as\nJackson\u2019s), Mary balks and says she is being tricked, since she\nknows that bananas are yellow, and this, says Mary, is a consequence\nof knowing everything physical about colour perception. Mary does not\nlearn anything new when she sees coloured objects for the first time,\nso there is no case against physicalism after all. Jackson\u2019s\ninitial thought experiment was very persuasive, but Dennett\u2019s\nseems equally so, thus, undermining Jackson\u2019s argument, although\nthere is greater resistence to the conclusion of the latter than the\nformer! Dennett complains a great deal about the ongoing\n\u201cMariology\u201d, as he calls the continuing acceptance of\nJackson\u2019s thought experiment as a poweful case against\nphysicalism.\n\nClearly, thought experiments are characterized by an intriguing\nplasticity, and this raises the interesting question of what it is\nthat preserves the identity of a thought experiment. Replacing a red\ntomato with a blue banana might still leave us with the same thought\nexperiment\u2013\u2013slightly revised. But, at what point do we get\na new thought experiment? This is not merely a question about\nconceptual vagueness. It helps to facilitate a discussion of the\nintuitively most plausible view about the cognitive efficacy of\nthought experiments, according to which this power depends on their\nbeing arguments, in a fairly strict sense of argument. John D. Norton\nholds such a view, which will be discussed below. In light of cases\nwhere the discussion of one and the same thought experiment played an\nimportant role in settling a dispute, the following problem arises:\nhow can one and the same thought experiment support opposing views\nabout a particular matter if the arguments that correspond to the\ndifferent versions of the thought experiment that were entertained by\nthe disputing parties are significantly different? The dilemma is: we\ncould say that if there is more than one argument then there is more\nthan one thought experiment involved in the dispute. But if that is\ntrue then the disputing parties simply talked past each other. One\nparty presented an argument that the other party ignored while\npresenting their own. Alternatively, we can say that one thought\nexperiment can correspond to many different arguments. But, if that is\ntrue then it becomes unclear in what non-trivial sense thought\nexperiments are supposed to be identical with arguments (see Bishop\n1999, and the response by Norton 2004, 63\u201364).\n\nThe plasticity of thought experiments coheres with another feature of\nthought experiments, namely that they seem to have \u201cevidential\nsignificance only historically and locally, i.e., when and where\npremises that attribute evidential significance to it [\u2026] are\nendorsed\u201d (McAllister 1996, p. 248).\n2. Taxonomies of Thought Experiments\n\nMany taxonomies can be found in the literature. They are not mutually\nexclusive. We will present three of them. The first follows the type\nof purpose thought experiments serve. A very rudimentary version of it\ncan be found in Mach (1897 and 1905). Such a classification makes\nsense, because an \u201cimaginary experiment should be judged on its\nspecific purpose\u201d (Krimsky 1973, p. 331). Thought experiments\nare conducted for diverse reasons (see, e.g., DeMay 2006; Sorensen\n1992, pp. 7\u201315), and this in a variety of areas, including\neconomics (see, e.g., Herfeld 2019; Thoma 2016), education (Helm and\nGilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985, Klassen 2006; Sriraman 2006; Stonier\n1990), history (see, e.g., Maar 2014; Reiss 2009), literature (see,\ne.g., Davies 2007; Elgin 2004), mathematics (see, e.g. Brown 1991\n[2011], pp. 90\u201397; Glas 1999), morality (see, e.g., Hauerwas\n1996; Wilson 2016), as well as the natural sciences (see Krimsky\n1973), the socio-political realm (see, e.g. Roberts 1993: Thaler\n2016), and theology (see, e.g., Gregersen 2014; Fehige 2024). Thought\nexperiments may be used to entertain. This is probably true of short\nstories or novels which some argue qualify as thought experiments if\ncertain conditions apply (see, e.g., Davenport 1983). Some thought\nexperiments fulfil a specific function within a theory (see Borsboom\net al. 2002). Others are executed because it is impossible to run the\nexperimental scenario in the real world (see, e.g., Sorensen 1992, pp.\n200\u2013202). Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and\nclarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the\nprocess of understanding (see Behmel 2001). Again others serve as\nexamples in conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz 2006). And, then there\nare those that matter in the process of theory discovery (Praem and\nSteglich\u2013Peterson 2015). The thought experiments that have\nreceived most of the attention are taken to provide evidence for or\nagainst a theory, putting them on a par with real-world experiments\n(see, e.g., Gendler 2004). The different ways to use thought\nexperiments, of course, do not exclude one another. Most obviously,\nfor example, a thought experiment can both entertain and make a case\nagainst a theory.\n\nA second taxonomy classifies thought experiments in terms of their\nlogical structure (see Sorensen 1992, pp. 132\u2013166). The idea is\nto divide all thought experiments into two types of \u201calethic\nrefuters\u201d: \u201cAlthough there are a number of ways to\nclassify thought experiments, a refutation format scores the most\npoints when judged by familiarity, specificity, and simplicity.\nAccording to this scheme, thought experiments aim at overturning\nstatements by disproving one of their modal consequences. Modalities\nare operators that are applied to propositions to yield new\npropositions. There are deontic modalities (permissible,\nforbidden), epistemic modalities (know, believe), and\nalethic modalities (possible, necessary). The alethic\nmodalities are the best\u2013known and more\u2013basic modality.\nHence, we won\u2019t miss anything by concentrating on them\u201d\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135). One type of thought experiment \u201cis\ndesigned to refute a statement by showing that something ruled out as\nimpossible by that statement is really possible after all\u201d\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135). The most discussed examples in the\nmetaphilosophical discussion on thought experiments is of such a type,\nnamely the Gettier scenarios (see Grundmann & Horvarth 2014;\nSaint-Germier 2019). They are designed to refute the claim that all\nknowledge is justified, true belief. They serve as a \u201cnecessity\nrefuter.\u201d The other type collects examples of \u201cpossibility\nrefuters\u201d. They don\u2019t affirm \u201cthe possibility of the\nthought experiment\u2019s content\u201d. Instead, they establish\n\u201ccopossibilities\u201d. A wonderful example is the scenario of\nan omnipotent God who faces the task of creating a stone too heavy for\nthat God to lift. It seems God cannot succeed. The notion of divine\nomnipotence causes some headache here.\n\nA third taxonomy (see Brown 1991, chapter 2), which has not gone\nunchallenged (see Norton 1993b), is more limited than the first two\ninsofar as it focuses largely on the class of those thought\nexperiments that are taken to function in theory choice, which is the\nuse of thought experiments that has been receiving most of the\nattention. According to this taxonomy, the main division is\nconstructive vs. destructive and resembles Karl\nPopper\u2019s distinction between apologetic and\ncritical thought experiments. Popper actually distinguishes\nbetween three types of thought experiments: heuristic (to\nillustrate a theory), critical (against a theory) and\napologetic (in favour of a theory) (see Popper 1959). His\ncase in favour of a critical and against an apologetic use of thought\nexperiments is very limited. He focuses exclusively on quantum physics\nand doesn\u2019t really say much to address the primary\nepistemological challenge presented by the success of critical thought\nexperiments.\n\nAmong destructive thought experiments, the following subtypes\ncan be identified: the simplest of these is to draw out a\ncontradiction in a theory, thereby refuting it. The first part of\nGalileo\u2019s famous falling bodies example does this. It shows that\nin Aristotle\u2019s account, a composite body (cannon ball and musket\nball attached) would have to fall both faster and slower than the\ncannon ball alone. A second subtype is constituted by those thought\nexperiments that aim to show that the theory in question is in\nconflict with other beliefs that we hold. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nwell-known cat paradox, for instance, does not show that quantum\ntheory (at least on some interpretations) is internally inconsistent\n(see Schr\u00f6dinger 1935, p. 812; translation: Trimmer 1980, p.\n328): \u201cA cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the\nfollowing diabolical device (which must be secured against direct\ninterference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of\nradioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of one\nhour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability,\nperhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a\nrelay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic\nacid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one\nwould say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed.\nThe first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The q-function of the\nentire system would express this by having in it the living and the\ndead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal\nparts.\u201d This thought experiment shows that quantum theory (as\ninterpreted by Bohr) is in conflict with some very powerful common\nsense beliefs we have about macro-sized objects such as\ncats\u2013\u2013they cannot be both dead and alive in any sense\nwhatsoever. The bizarreness of superpositions in the atomic world is\nworrisome enough, says Schr\u00f6dinger, but when it implies that same\nbizarreness at an everyday level, it is intolerable. There is a third\nsubtype of negative thought experiments, namely when, in effect, a\ncentral assumption or premise of the thought experiment itself is\nundermined. For example, as we have seen above, Thomson showed with\nher thought experiment that \u201cright to life\u201d and\n\u201cright to what is needed to sustain life\u201d had been run\ntogether. When distinguished, the argument against abortion is\nnegatively affected.\n\nA fourth sub-type of negative thought experiments are \u201ccounter\nthought experiments\u201d (see Brown 2007). Norton very usefully\nintroduces a related idea:\n\u201cthought-experiment/anti-thought-experiment pairs\u201d (see\nNorton 2004, pp. 45\u201349). Above, we have already encountered this\nsubtype in our discussion of Lucretius\u2019 spear-thought\nexperiment, and with Dennett\u2019s reply to Jackson\u2019s much\ndiscussed Mary the colour scientist thought experiment. Here we would\nlike to add one more example, namely Mach\u2019s counter thought\nexperiment against absolute space. In his Principia\nMathematica, Newton offers a pair of thought experiments as\nevidence for absolute space. One is the bucket thought experiment with\nwater climbing the wall (see Fig. 3), the other is about a pair of\nspheres joined by a cord that maintained its tension in otherwise\nempty space (see Fig. 4). The explanation for these phenomena, argues\nNewton, is absolute space: the bucket and the joined spheres are\nrotating with respect to space itself. In response, Mach modifies the\nscenario and argues, contra Newton, that the two spheres would move\ntoward one another thanks to the tension in the cord, and if we\nrotated a very thick, massive ring around a stationary bucket, we\nwould see the water climb the bucket wall. (For further discussion of\nMach\u2019s counter thought experiment to Newton\u2019s see\nK\u00fchne 2006, pp. 191\u2013202). In short, the point of\nMach\u2019s counter thought experiments is to describe the phenomena\nof the thought experiments\u2019 scenarios differently, that is, to\ndeclare that different things would happen. Mach\u2019s counter\nthought experiment undermines our confidence in Newton\u2019s thought\nexperiments. Absolute space might be a plausible explanation of the\nphenomena in Newton\u2019s thought experiments, but now, in light of\nMach\u2019s counter thought experiment, we\u2019re not so sure of\nthe phenomena itself and thus of the idea of absolute space.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Stages in the bucket\nexperiment\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Two spheres held by a cord in\notherwise empty space\n\n\nTo be effective, counter thought experiments needn\u2019t be very\nplausible at all. In a court of law a jury would convict provided\nguilt is established \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d A common\ndefence strategy is to provide an alternative account of the evidence\nthat has just enough plausibility to put the prosecution\u2019s case\ninto some measure of doubt. That is sufficient to undermine it. A\ncounter thought experiment need only do that much to be effective, and\nin this sense it operates like a \u201cnecessity refuter\u201d in\nSorensen\u2019s sense.\n\nIn addition to destructive ones, there is a second type, the\nconstructive thought experiments. Unsurprisingly, there are\nmany ways they could provide positive support for a theory. One of\nthese is to provide a kind of illustration that makes a theory\u2019s\nclaims clear and evident. In such cases thought experiments serve as a\nkind of heuristic aid. A result may already be well established, but\nthe thought experiment can lead to a very satisfying sense of\nunderstanding. In his Principia Mathematica, Newton provides\na wonderful example showing how the moon is kept in its orbit in just\nthe same way as an object falls to the earth (see Ducheyne 2006, pp.\n435\u2013437). He illustrates this by means of a cannon shooting a\ncannon ball further and further (see Fig. 5). In the limit, the earth\ncurves away as fast as the ball falls, with the eventual result being\nthat the cannon ball will return to the spot where it was fired, and,\nif not impeded, will go around again and again. This is what the moon\nis doing. We could arrive at the same conclusion through calculation.\nBut Newton\u2019s thought experiment provides that elusive sense of\nunderstanding. It\u2019s a wonderful example of the \u201caha\neffect\u201d that is typical of many powerful thought\nexperiments.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. \u201cThe shot heard around\nthe world\u201d\n\n\nThomson\u2019s violinist showed that abortion could be morally\npermissible even when the fetus has a right to life. Similarly,\nEinstein\u2019s elevator showed that light will bend in a\ngravitational field, because according to the principle of\nequivalence, there is no difference between such a frame of reference\nand one that is accelerating in free space; the laws of physics are\nthe same in all. Suppose then, an observer is inside an elevator\nsealed off from the outside so that the observer cannot tell whether\nhe is in a gravitational field or accelerating. If it were\naccelerating, and if a light beam were to enter one side, then, due to\nthe elevator\u2019s motion, the beam would appear to drop or curve\ndown as it crossed the elevator. Consequently, it would have to do the\nsame thing if the elevator was in a gravitational field. Therefore,\ngravity \u2018bends\u2019 light.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s demon showed that entropy could be decreased: The\nsecond law of thermodynamics implies that heat won\u2019t pass from a\ncold body to a hot one. In classical thermodynamics this law is quite\nstrict; but in Maxwell\u2019s kinetic theory of heat there is a\nprobability, though extremely small, of such an event happening. Some\nthought this a reductio ad absurdum of Maxwell\u2019s theory. To show\nhow it is possible to violate the second law, Maxwell imagined a tiny\ncreature who controls a door between two chambers. Fast molecules from\nthe cold box are let into the hot box, and slow molecules from the hot\nare allowed into the cold. Thus, there will be an increase in the\naverage speed in the hot box and a decrease in the average speed of\nmolecules in the cold. Since, on Maxwell\u2019s theory, heat is just\nthe average speed of the molecules, there has been a flow of heat from\na cold body to a hot one.\n\nParfit\u2019s splitting persons shows that survival is a more\nimportant notion than identity when considering personhood (for a\ncritical discussion see Gendler 2002a). We say they \u201cshow\u201d\nsuch and such, but, \u201cpurport to show\u201d might be better,\nsince some of these thought experiments are quite contentious. What\nthey have in common is that they aim to establish something positive.\nUnlike destructive thought experiments, they are not trying to\ndemolish an existing theory, though they may do that in passing. To\nrepeat an important point: in principle, given the fact that thought\nexperiments can be rethought (see Bokulich 2001), and that the\nevidential significance is dependent on historical and local\naccomplishments (see McAllister 1996), it cannot be irrelevant to\nidentify the intention of the thought experimenter, if one wants to\ndetermine the type of a thought experiment: \u201cAn imaginary\nexperiment should be judged on its specific purpose\u201d (Krimsky\n1973, p. 331).\n3. The History of Thought Experiments\n\nThe practice of thought experiments is not an invention of modern\nscience. That fact may be obscured by the dominance of scientific\nexamples in the lively discussions about thouht experiments today. The\nPre-Socratics \u201cinvented thought experimentation as a cognitive\nprocedure and practiced it with great dedication and\nversatility\u201d (Rescher 2005, p. 2). \u201cThere is no ancient\nGreek term corresponding to what we nowadays refer to as a thought\nexperiment, and presumably ancient philosophers did not have our\nmodern notion of a thought experiment. But there is no doubt that they\ndid use thought experiments. In fact, they often employed them in ways\nsimilar to those of contemporary philosophers, that is, both for\ndefending their own theories as well as for refuting the theories of\ntheir opponents \u201d (Ierodiakonou 2018, p. 31). (See also Becker\n2018; Diamond 2002, pp. 229\u2013232; Fuhrer 2009; Glas 1999;\nIerodiakonou 2005; Ierodiakonou and Roux (eds.) 2011; Irvine 1991;\nRescher 1991 and 2005, pp. 61\u201372). The situation is similar with\nrespect to medieval natural philosophy, although there are further\nnuances to be considered (see King 1991). According to Edward Grant,\nduring the late Middle Ages \u201cthe imagination became a formidable\ninstrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that would have\nastonished ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially\nAristotle\u201d (Grant 2007, p. 201). But this doesn\u2019t mean\nthat we have reason to think of Aristotle as an opponent of the\nconduct of thought experiments tout court. On the contrary,\n\u201cAristotle uses thought experiments for argumentative persuasion\nand in places where, due to the obscure nature of the subject matter\nor the counterintuitive nature of the thesis they are meant to\nsupport, insight cannot be readily communicated by appeal to\nobservational facts\u201d (Corcilius 2018, p. 73). With a few\nexceptions that involved problems of motion, \u201cthe\nscholastics\u201d of the medieval period made no meaningful effort to\ntransform their hypothetical conclusions into specific knowledge about\nthe physical world. They did, however, assume that although these\nhypothetical conclusions were naturally impossible, God could produce\nthem supernaturally if he wished. Special attention received also a\nclass of medieval thought experiments that does not rely on\ncounterfactuals but depends on theological assumptions to study\nmatters non-theological, namely those thought experiments involving\nangels, whose existence were affirmed at that time (see Perler 2008).\nAngels are gone by now (see Clark 1992), but not thought experiments.\nWhile most thought experiments involving angels have Christianity as\ntheir context, there is evidence of the practice of thought\nexperiments also in the context of Islam and Judaism (see McGinnis\n2018; Fisch 2019). In fact, the case has been made \u201cthat Ibn\nSina is the first philosopher in the Aristotelian tradition, and thus\nperhaps the first in Western philosophy overall, to try to identify\nthe psychological processes that go into postulating a hypothetical\nscenario. Ibn Sina also exhibits an interest in accounting for why,\nand to what extent, such psychological acts are thought to carry\nweight in our study of nature\u201d (Kukkonen 2014, p. 434).\n\nErnst Mach is commonly credited with introducing the word\n\u201cthought experiment\u201d (Gadankenexperiment) and\nthereby coining a term for philosophical discussion (recently done,\nfor instance, by Krauthausen 2015, p. 15). \u201c This view is\nincorrect, however! [\u2026] it can be substantiated that it was\nused [\u2026] already in 1811\u201d (Witt-Hansen 1976, p. 48; see\nalso Buzzoni 2008, pp. 14\u201315; 61\u201365; K\u00fchne 2005, pp.\n92\u2013224; Moue et al. 2006, p. 63). The conceptual history of\n\u201cthought experiment\u201d goes back at least to the Danish\n\u201cTankeexperiment,\u201d as it was used by Hans-Christian\n\u00d8rsted. We can go back even further and find in the work of the\nGerman philosopher-scientist Georg Lichtenberg (1742\u20131799) a\ntacit theory of \u201cexperiments with thoughts and ideas.\u201d\nThese experiments help to overcome habits of thought that can inhibit\nscientific progress, and make possible an enlightened philosophy (see\nSchildknecht 1990, pp. 21; 123\u2013169; Sch\u00f6ne 1982).\nLichtenberg\u2019s \u201caphoristic experiments\u201d (see Stern\n1963, pp. 112\u2013126) reflect \u201cthat Lichtenberg\u2019s\nscientific preoccupations are the formal and thematic prolegomena to\nhis work as a literary artist\u201d (Stern 1963, p. 126).\nLichtenberg\u2019s reflections on thought experimentation resemble\nthose of Popper and Thomas S. Kuhn, and it is plausible to think of\nhim as one important figure of the very first period in the history of\nphilosophical inquiry into thought experiments (see Fehige and Stuart\n2014).\n\nAccordingly, the modern history of the philosophical investigation\ninto thought experiments can be divided into four stages: in the 18th\nand 19th century the awareness of the importance of thought\nexperiments in philosophy and science emerges. In addition to\nLichtenberg and Hans-Christian \u00d8rsted, special mention should\nbe made of Novalis (see Daiber 2001). The topic reemerges in a more\nsystematic manner at the beginning of the 20th century with little\nrelation to the attempts made at the first stage. The stakeholders of\nthe second stage were Pierre Duhem, Mach, and Alexius Meinong (see\nDuhem 1913, pp. 304\u2013311; Mach, 1883, pp. 48\u201358, 1897 and\n1905; Meinong 1907). A third stage, probably due to the rediscovery of\nthe importance of scientific practice for a proper understanding of\nscience, followed in the first part of the second half of the 20th\ncentury. Again, the contributions of this stage bear little relation\nto the two previous stages. While the third period has seen a number\nof noteworthy contributions (Cole 1983; Dancy 1985; Dennett 1985;\nFodor 1964; Helm and Gilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985; Krimsky 1973;\nMcMullin 1985; Myers 1986; Poser 1984; Prudovsky 1989; Rehder 1980a,b;\nYourgrau 1962 and 1967), the protagonists of this period were\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, Kuhn and Popper. The ongoing philosophical\nexploration of thought experiments began in the 1980s, and marks the\nfourth stage. Arguably, it has been the most prolific one of all four\nstages. With some very important sign-postings in place (Horowitz and\nMassey (eds.) 1991; Sorensen 1992; Wilkes 1988), the ongoing\ndiscussion took off in light of a debate between James Robert Brown\nand John D. Norton (see for a concise statement of each position Brown\n2004 and Norton 2004), which many have found useful to establish a\ncontrast with their own alternative accounts of thought experiments.\nThese views \u201crepresent the extremes of platonic rationalism and\nclassic empiricism, respectively\u201d (Moue et al. 2006, p. 69).\nThey will be described below.\n4. Current Views on Thought Experiments\n\nAt this point it is important to recall the key epistemological\nchallenge described in the introduction: how can we learn about the\nreal world through merely thinking about imagined scenarios? This\nchallenge sits at the center of the discussion about thought\nexperiments even though we must note that not all of the work\ndiscussed below focuses on it directly. Still, this section describes\nsix views that can be seen as responding in some way to this\nchallenge: The Skeptical Objection, The Intuition-Based Account, The\nArgument View, Conceptual Constructivism, Experimentalism, and The\nMental-Model Account.\n4.1 The Skeptical Objection\n\nOf course, particular thought experiments have been contested. But for\nthe most part, the practice of thought experiments in the sciences has\nbeen cheerfully accepted. Pierre Duhem, the great historian of\nphysics, is almost alone in what has been understood as an outright\ncondemnation of scientific thought experiments (see Duhem 1913, pp.\n304\u2013311). A thought experiment is no substitute for a real\nexperiment, he claimed, and should be forbidden in science, including\nscience education. However, in view of the important role of actual\nthought experiments in the history of physics \u2014 from\nGalileo\u2019s falling bodies, to Newton\u2019s bucket, to\nEinstein\u2019s elevator \u2014 it is unlikely that anyone will feel\nor should feel much sympathy for Duhem\u2019s strictures. We hasten\nto add that Buzzoni (2018) questions the validity of this reading of\nDuhem, and argues that already Mach\u2019s reception of Duhem\u2019s\nviews suggests a more nuanced reading of Duhem\u2019s position.\n\nPhilosophers can be as critical as Duhem when it comes to thought\nexperimenting in their own field (see Peijnenburg; Atkinson 2003;\nThagard 2014; Wilson 2016). At least thought experiments in science,\nthe skeptic claims, can be tested by physical experiment. However,\nthis is clearly false, since frictionless planes and universes empty\nof all material bodies cannot be produced in any laboratory. True, the\nresults of philosophical thought experiments cannot be even\napproximately tested. But, skeptics say little about why thought\nexperiments enjoy such popularity in philosophy. We are inclined to\nsay that skeptics underestimate the importance of thought experiments\nfor the creative mind in any field. Also, one mustn\u2019t forget\nthat the cognitive power of real world experiments isn\u2019t a\nself-evident matter either.\n\nFew are outright skeptics, however. Many take a more ambiguous stance.\nS\u00f6ren H\u00e4ggqvist, for example, has developed a normative\nmodel for philosophical thought experiments (see H\u00e4ggqvist 1996\nand 2009). Surprisingly, none of the commonly accepted philosophical\nthought experiments satisfies his model. And the process of\nidentifying successful thought experiments is only the first step in\naddressing the central epistemological challenge posed by thought\nexperiments. It gets much messier once we begin to ask exactly how\nreliable \u201csuccessful\u201d thought experiments are. Granted,\nthere is some justice in worrying about the reliability of\nphilosophical thought experiments (see, e.g., Klee 2008). This might\nbe true for ethics (see Dancy 1985, Jackson 1992; Wilson 2016),\nconceptual analysis (see Fodor 1964), and the philosophy of mind:\n\u201cA popular strategy in philosophy is to construct a certain sort\nof thought experiment I call intuition pump. [\u2026] Intuition\npumps are often abused, though seldom deliberately\u201d (Dennett\n1985, p. 12). The claim by Dennett and others is that thought\nexperiments too often rest on prejudice and faulty common sense; they\nare inherently conservative, while real science will likely result in\nhighly-counterintuitive outcomes. Dennett believes that thought\nexperiments rest on naive \u201cfolk concepts,\u201d which is why\nthey can be so misguided. It is far from clear that this is a fair\ncharge. Everything involved in Galileo\u2019s thought experiment that\nproduced the principle of relativity could be called \u201cfolk\nconcepts.\u201d If we are inside a ship and perform a number of\nexperiments, such as walking about, tossing a ball, watching birds fly\nabout, we could not tell whether we are at rest in port or sailing\nover a smooth sea. The upshot is that nature behaves the same either\nway; the laws of nature are the same in any inertial frame. This\nresult is profound and is still with us in Einstein\u2019s\nrelativity, whether it is folk physics or not.\n\nFrequently discussed is the skeptical challenge raised by Kathleen\nWilkes. She expresses a deep suspicion of scenarios such as Derek\nParfit\u2019s people splitting like an amoeba (see Parfit 1987;\nGendler 2002a). Wilkes wants philosophy \u201cto use science fact\nrather than science fiction or fantasy\u201d (Wilkes 1988, p. 1), and\ntherefore to refrain from using thought experiments because they are\n\u201cboth problematic and positively misleading\u201d (Wilkes 1988,\np. 2). She claims that thought experiments about personal identity in\nparticular often fail to provide the background conditions against\nwhich the experiment is set (see Wilkes 1988, p. 7). She thinks we\nwould not know what to say if we encountered someone who split like an\namoeba. She insists that a legitimate thought experiment must not\nviolate the known laws of nature. We do agree with Wilkes that\nunderdetermination can be a problem. But instead of dismissing thought\nexperiments in philosophy we should consider it a crucial factor in\nassessing the quality of a thought experiment (see Rescher 2005, pp.\n9\u201314). That is to say that the more detailed the imaginary\nscenario in the relevant aspects is, the better the thought experiment\n(see Brendel 2004, pp. 97\u201399; H\u00e4ggqvist 1996, p. 28).\n\nWe also agree that the inferences drawn in thought experimenting are\nhighly problematic if the hypothetical scenario \u201cis inadequately\ndescribed\u201d (Wilkes 1988, p. 8). But Wilkes seems to think that\nthe lack of description is unavoidable, which supposedly amounts to a\nreason against philosophical thought experiments on personal identity\nbecause persons are not natural kinds. This makes it impossible to\nfill in necessary information to make the thought experiment work\ngiven its unavoidable underdetermination. Wilkes thinks that\n\u201cwhenever we are examining the ranges of concepts that do not\npick on natural kinds, the problem of deciding what is or what is not\n\u2018relevant\u2019 to the success of the thought experiment is yet\nmore problematic than the same question as it arises in science; and,\nunlike the scientific problem, it may not even have an answer in\nprinciple\u201d (Wilkes 1988, p. 15). She adds that scientific laws\n\u2014 especially those describing biological kinds like human beings\n\u2014 \u201care not disjoint and independent, detachable from one\nanother [\u2026]. They are interrelated, to varying degrees of\ncourse\u201d (Wilkes 1988, p. 29). This implies, for example, that\n\u201ca full psychophysiological account of the processes of human\nperception must at some stage link up with part at least of linguistic\nability; for we typically see things under a certain description, and\nthat description may be a very sophisticated one\u201d (Wilkes 1988,\np. 29). These considerations have her rule out experiments that\nchallenge the human monopoly of personhood. No thought experiment,\nclaims Wilkes, is well conceived if it involves non-human animals or\ncomputers as persons. But also those thought experiments can be ruled\nout which involve the \u201cfission or fusion of humans\u201d\nbecause it is not theoretically possible. \u201cThe total impact of\nthe sum of laws that group us together as human beings (a natural kind\ncategory) precludes our splitting into two [\u2026] or fusing with\nsomeone else\u201d (Wilkes 1988, p. 36).\n\nOne can ascertain here all too well the inherent difficulties in\nthinking about personal identity and the limited benefit some thought\nexperiments might have for what is deemed the proper metaphysics of\npersonal identity. Nevertheless, good reasons have been given in\nfavour of the use of thought experiments about personal identity (see\nBeck 2006; Kolak 1993; Hershenov 2008). We also feel that the problems\nabout thought experiments on personal identity reveal more about the\nintricate nature of the subject than about the usefulness of\nphilosophical thought experiments. And, disregarding other\nshortcomings in Wilkes\u2019 skepticism (for further discussion of\nWilkes\u2019 views see Beck 1992; Brooks 1994; Focquaert 2003;\nH\u00e4ggqvist 1996, pp. 27\u201334), her suggestion that thought\nexperimental scenarios would have to satisfy current scientific\nknowledge about the relevant entities featured in a thought experiment\nis highly implausible. We learn a great deal about the world and our\ntheories when we wonder, for instance, what would have happened after\nthe big bang if the law of gravity had been an inverse cube law\ninstead of an inverse square. Would stars have failed to form?\nReasoning about such a scenario is perfectly coherent and very\ninstructive, even though it violates a law of nature.\n\nTo some extent we should share Wilkes\u2019s concern that thought\nexperimenting seems to be constrained only by relevant logical\nimpossibilities and what seems intuitively acceptable. This is indeed\nproblematic because intuitions can be highly misleading and relevant\nlogical impossibilities are fairly ungrounded if they cannot be\nsupplemented by relevant theoretical impossibilities based on current\nscience in order to avoid the jump into futile fantasy. But in order\nto dismiss thought experimenting as a useful philosophical tool one\nhas to show that intuition cannot be a source of knowledge and that an\nepistemic tool should be useless because there is a serious chance it\ncan fail. Timothy Williamson has argued that we should forget about\nintuition as a cushion in the philosophical armchair (see Williamson\n2004a,b, 2008, pp. 179\u2013207, and 2009; see also Schaffer 2017).\nThe importance of intuitions in philosophy has been neglected in the\npast (see Williamson 2004b, p. 109\u2013110), and for too long\nintuition didn\u2019t receive the attention it deserves (see, e.g.,\nDePaul and Ramsey (eds.) 1998). Besides the traditional divide between\nempiricists, rationalists and skeptics, it is not only a very\nnon-uniform use of the word \u201cintuition\u201d that makes it\ndifficult to assess the progress of the last years of philosophical\ninquiry about intuitions. The situation has been complicated by the\ncontributions of experimental philosophers on intuitions who add\ndifferent reasons to question their reliability (see for a careful\ncritique of those reasons: Ludwig 2007; see also Ludwig 2018).\nGenerally speaking, the reliability of intuitions has been challenged\non two grounds. One stems from an evolutionary explanation of the\ncapacity to intuit; another is due to experiments which supposedly\nshow the cultural relativity or racial and gender sensitivity of\nintuitions (see, e.g., Buckwalter and Stich 2010): \u201c\u2026a\nsubstantial list of philosophical intuitions vary across demographic\ngroups and\u2026they are influenced by a number of prima\nfacie irrelevant factors\u2026Some writers\u2026have urged\nthat these findings justify a thoroughgoing skepticism about the use\nof intuitions as evidence in philosophy\u2026But we think this\nconclusion is much too strong\u2026\u201d (Stich & Toba 2018,\np. 379). After all, knowledge without intuitions (if only common sense\nassumptions) seems impossible.\n\nThe recent discussion of intuitions in epistemology has barely made an\nimpact on philosophical reflections about thought experiments. As far\nas philosophical thought experiments are concerned, this is as it\nshould be, according to Williamson. In this respect George Bealer can\nbe cited in support of Williamson, because for Bealer the talk about\nphilosophical thought experiments reveals a conceptual confusion.\nPhilosophy, he claims, is about \u201crational intuitions\u201d and\nthought experiments can be only about \u201cphysical\nintuitions\u201d (see Bealer 1998, pp. 207\u2013208, and 2002, p.\n74). To many, this is an implausible claim based on a deeply\nproblematic \u201cphenomenology of intuitions\u201d resulting in a\nstrict separation of \u201crational intuitions\u201d from\n\u201cphysical intuitions\u201d, on such grounds as an alleged\nimmutability of \u201crational intuitions\u201d. There are good\nreasons to believe that thought experiments appeal to intuitions in\norder to give us new insights about different realms of investigation,\nincluding philosophy. This kind of positive connection is what\nWilliamson has in mind when addressing the role of intuitions in\nphilosophical thought experiments like the famous Gettier cases, which\novernight found acceptance by the philosophical community in their aim\nto refute the view that knowledge is justified true belief. While\nWilliamson expects \u201carmchair methods to play legitimately a more\ndominant role in future philosophy\u201d (Williamson 2009, p. 126),\nhe thinks that \u201cwe should stop talking about intuition\u201d\n(Williamson 2004b, p. 152). This does not impress proponents of what\nwe call an intuition-based account of thought experiments, and\nprobably for good reasons, given the problems in Williamson\u2019s\napproach (see, e.g., Dohrn 2016; Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009; Schaffer\n2017), and the strong empirical evidence in favour of the positive\nrole that intuitions does play in human cognition (see Myers\n2004).\n4.2 The Intuition\u2013Based Account\n\nWhat we term the \u201cintuition\u2013based account\u201d of\nthought experiments comes in a naturalistic version (see Brendel 2004;\nGendler 2007), and in a Platonic version (see Brown 1991a [2011]). We\nbegin with a discussion of the latter. Brown holds that in a few\nspecial cases we do go well beyond the old empirical data to acquire a\npriori knowledge of nature (see also Koyr\u00e9 1968). Galileo\nshowed that all bodies fall at the same speed with a brilliant thought\nexperiment that started by destroying the then reigning Aristotelian\naccount. The latter holds that heavy bodies fall faster than light\nones (H > L). But consider Figure 6, in which a\nheavy cannon ball (H) and light musket ball (L) are\nattached together to form a compound object (H+L);\nthe latter must fall faster than the cannon ball alone. Yet the\ncompound object must also fall slower, since the light part will act\nas a drag on the heavy part. Now we have a contradiction:\nH+L > H and H >\nH+L. That\u2019s the end of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory. But there is a bonus, since the right account is now obvious:\nthey all fall at the same speed (H = L =\nH+L).\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Galileo: \u201cI don\u2019t\neven have to look\u201d\n\n\nBrown claims this is a priori (though still fallible) knowledge of\nnature, since there are no new data involved, nor is the conclusion\nderived from old data. Moreover, is it some sort of logical truth (for\na technical challenge of this claim see Urbaniak 2012). This account\nof thought experiments can be further developed by linking the a\npriori epistemology to accounts of laws of nature that hold that laws\nare relations among objectively existing abstract entities. It is thus\na form of Platonism, not unlike Platonic accounts of mathematics such\nas that urged by Kurt G\u00f6del.\n\nThe two most often repeated arguments against this sort of Platonism\nare: it does not identify criteria to distinguish good from bad\nthought experiments, and it violates the principle of ontological\nparsimony. These seem weak objections. Perhaps they find widespread\nacceptance because Platonism seems to be unfashionable these days (see\nGrundmann 2018), given the general popularity of various forms of\nnaturalism. If intuitions really do the job in a thought experiment,\nthe first objection is weak because neither rationalists nor\nempiricists have a theory about the reliability of intuitions. So the\nobjection should be that intuitions probably just do not matter in\nhuman cognition. However, there are good reasons to question the truth\nof this claim (see Myers 2004). This is not to marginalize the\nproblems that arise when admitting intuitions as a source of knowledge\nand justification, especially in philosophy (see Hitchcock 2012).\n\nAs for the second objection, the appeal to Occam\u2019s razor is in\ngeneral problematic when it is employed to rule out a theory. Whatever\nwe eliminate by employing the principle of parsimony, we can easily\nreintroduce it by an inference to the best explanation (see Meixner\n2000). And this is exactly what a Platonist contends his or her\nPlatonism about thought experimenting to be, while conceding that the\nPlatonic intuition appears miraculous. But are they really more\nmiraculous than sense perception, which seems similar in many respects\nto Platonic intuition? One might want to say yes, because supposedly\nwe have no clue at all how Platonic intuition works but we do have\nsome idea about the nature of sense perception. We know that if an\nobject is far away it appears smaller in vision, and under certain\nlight conditions the same object can look quite different. However, is\nit really impossible to state similar rules to capture the nature of\nPlatonic intuition? If you are drunk or lack attention you most\nprobably will not be very successful in intuiting anything of\nphilosophical value.\n\nA review of the relevant psychological literature will reveal further\ncriteria that could be employed to identify good and bad conditions\nfor Platonic intuition while thought experimenting. Yet, proponents of\nthe naturalistic version of the intuition\u2013based account wonder\nhow necessary Platonism is once this move is entertained in defence of\nthe reliability of intuitions (see Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 2004).\nElke Brendel defines intuitions as mental propositional attitudes\naccompanied with a strong feeling of certainty. In her view, we can\ntell two stories to make sense of their cognitive power and\nplasticity. One story relates to our biological constitution and\nevolutionary past. The other is about membership in specialized\ncommunities. Brendel\u2019s account raises many questions, but it is\ndifficult to resist its appeal. A universal set is appealing to anyone\nnot trained in logic because most things we are familiar with can come\nin sets, such as books, tables, and philosophers. A set of all sets\nseems intuitively plausible. The intuition disappears once you worked\nyourself through the problems arising from the idea of a set of all\nsets. Brendel is quick to insist that such relativity of our\nintuitions doesn\u2019t imply that they are cognitively useless.\nWithout intuitions, we probably wouldn\u2019t have knowledge, and\nthought experiments are sometimes the only way to access the\nintuitions that guide us in our cognitive lives (see Brendel\n2004).\n4.3 The Argument View\n\nJohn D. Norton is the most influential advocate of what we call\n\u201cthe argument view\u201d of thought experiments (see Norton\n1991, 1993, 1996, 2004a,b, 2008). Even though the argument view seems\nto be a natural option for empiricists, it seems that most empiricists\nfind Norton\u2019s argument view too strong. For this reason, many\nparticipants in the debate about thought experiments place themselves\nbetween the extreme views of Norton and Brown, which function as\nuseful foils for apparently more moderate outlooks. Perhaps (with\ntongue in cheek) they could agree with Bernard Shaw on the virtues of\nmoderation, when Shaw said of the typical member of the middle class\nthat he is moderately honest, moderately intelligent, and moderately\nfaithful to his spouse. Norton claims that any thought experiment is\nreally a (possibly disguised) argument; it starts with premises\ngrounded in experience and follows deductive or inductive rules of\ninference in arriving at its conclusion. The picturesque features of\nany thought experiment which give it an experimental flavour might be\npsychologically helpful, but are strictly redundant. Thus, says\nNorton, we never go beyond the empirical premises in a way to which\nany empiricist would object.\n\nThere are three objections that might be offered against Norton.\nFirst, his notion of argument is too vague. However, this might not be\nthe best objection: arguments can be deductive (which are perfectly\nclear) or inductive. If the latter are unclear, the fault is with\ninduction, not with Norton\u2019s argument view. Second, it is argued\nthat Norton simply begs the question: every real world experiment can\nbe rephrased as an argument, but nobody would say that real world\nexperiences are dispensable. The account does not address the\nquestion: where do the premises come from? A thought experiment might\nbe an essential step in making the Norton-style reconstruction. Third,\na thought experiment that is presented in argument form loses its\ntypical force. The soft-point in Brown\u2019s Platonism is linked to\nthe strength of Norton\u2019s account because Norton claims that any\nother view implies a commitment to \u201casking the oracle.\u201d\n\u201cImagine an oracle that claims mysterious powers but never\ndelivers predictions that could not be learned by simple inferences\nfrom ordinary experience. We would not believe that the oracle had any\nmysterious powers. I propose the same verdict for thought experiments\nin science\u201d (Norton 1996, pp. 1142\u20131143). Defenders of\nempiricist alternatives deny this dispensability thesis. Brendel\n(2018) offers a most comprehensive review of merits and perils of the\nargument view.\n4.4 Conceptual Constructivism\n\n\u201cConceptual constructivism\u201d, as we could call it, is among\nthe empiricist alternatives to the argument view. The position has\nbeen taken up by Van Dyck (2003) to account especially for\nHeisenberg\u2019s \u0263-ray microscope; but also by Gendler (1998)\nto makes sense of Galileo\u2019s falling body thought experiment.\nGendler\u2019s proposal was advanced in more general terms by\nCamilleri (2014) in order to establish a firm middle ground between\nthe views of Norton and Brown. Conceptual constructivism was first\nproposed by Thomas Kuhn (1964). He employs many of the concepts (but\nnot the terminology) of his well-known Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions. On his view a well-conceived thought experiment can\nbring on a crisis or at least create an anomaly in the reigning theory\nand so contribute to paradigm change. Thought experiments can teach us\nsomething new about the world, even though we have no new empirical\ndata, by helping us to re-conceptualize the world in a new way.\nAccordingly, some have entertained the option of conceptual\nconstructivism in the form of a Neo-Kantian reading of\nEinstein\u2019s famous clock in the box thought experiment. Such an\napproach is inspired by Michael Friedman\u2019s proposal to conceive\nof scientific revolutions as times when a Kantian kind of natural\nphilosophy plays a major role in guiding scientists from one paradigm\nto another. The work of Kuhn left us with a puzzle: if scientific\nrationality is absolutely dependent on a paradigm, and if during\nscientific revolutions one paradigm replaces another, not in degrees\nbut absolutely, comparable to a \u201cGestalt\u201d switch, then\nthis transition from one paradigm to the next cannot be a matter of\nscientific rationality. Are scientific revolutions irrational periods\nin the history of science? Not necessarily; some kind of natural\nphilosophy may guide the process. Friedman has a Kantian natural\nphilosophy in mind; his proposal did not earn wide acceptance, but the\nproblem remains (see Fisch 2017). Be that as it may, it is true that\nthought experiments are a valuable currency in times of scientific\nrevolution. For example, Lennox (1991) has argued that the revolution\nbrought about by Charles Darwin in 1859 was made possible by thought\nexperiments (among other things, of course).\n4.5 Experimentalism\n\nWhat we might term \u201cexperimentalism\u201d encompasses a wide\nrange of different approaches which all advance the view that thought\nexperiments are a \u201climiting case\u201d of ordinary experiments.\nExperimentalism was proposed first by Ernst Mach (1897 and 1905). He\ndefines experimenting in terms of its basic method of variation and\nits capacity to destroy prejudices about nature. According to Mach,\nexperimenting is innate to higher animals, including humans. The\nthought experiment just happens on a higher intellectual level but is\nbasically still an experiment. At the centre of thought experimenting\nis a \u201cGedankenerfahrung\u201d, an experience in thought. Such\nan experience is possible because thought experiments draw from\n\u201cunwillk\u00fcrliche Abbildungen von Tatsachen\u201d\n(non-arbitrary images of facts) acquired in past experiences of the\nworld. Some thought experiments are so convincing in their results\nthat an execution seems unnecessary; others could be conducted in a\nreal-world experiment, which is the most natural trajectory of a\nscientific thought experiment. In any case thought experiments can\nresult in a revision of belief, thereby demonstrating their\nsignificance for scientific progress. Mach also appreciates the\ndidactic value of thought experiments: they help us to realize what\ncan be accomplished in thinking and what cannot.\n\nIn the spirit of Mach, Sorensen (1992) has offered an aspiring version\nof experimentalism that accounts for thought experiments in science\nand philosophy, and tackles many of the central issues of the topic.\nSorensen claims that thought experiments are \u201ca subset of\nunexecuted experiments\u201d (1992, p. 213). By their logical nature\nthey are paradoxes that aim to test modal consequences of\npropositions. The origin of our capacity of thought experimentation is\nexplained in terms of Darwinian evolution (as in Genz 1999, pp.\n25\u201329), though the explanation has been criticized to be only\nlittle more than a \u2018just so story\u2019 that fails, on a\nposteriori grounds, to epistemically underwrite that capacity (see\nMaffie 1997). Others are more optimistic (see Shepard 2008).\n\nExperimentalism does not have to take a naturalistic turn as it does\nin Sorensen\u2019s case. In a number of contributions Marco Buzzoni\nhas defended a Neo-Kantian version of experimentalism (see Buzzoni\n2004, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2011b, 2013, 2013b). Buzzoni (2008) argues for\nthe dialectical unity of thought experiments and real-world\nexperiments. Thought experiments and real-world experiments are\nclaimed to be identical on the \u201ctechnological-operational\u201d\nlevel, and at least in science, one is impossible without the other:\nwithout thought experiments there wouldn\u2019t be real-world\nexperiments because we would not know how to put questions to nature;\nwithout real-world experiments there wouldn\u2019t be answers to\nthese questions or experience from which they could draw. Given the\nmany scientific thought experiments that cannot be realized in the\nreal-world, Buzzoni might be conflating thought experiments with\nimagined experiments to be carried out in the real-world (see Fehige\n2012, 2013b; and Buzzoni 2013b).\n\nIdealizations are common in both real experiments and thought\nexperiments. So-called Aristotelian idealization might ignore, say,\nthe colour of a falling object. Galilean idealizations ignore some\nphysical aspects, such as air friction, to get at the underlying\nphysics (McMullin 1985). So-called Platonic idelization goes beyond\nthis and ignores what would be actually seen even in a Galilean\nidealization. For instance, a rapidly moving object in special\nrelativity would not look contracted, but rather would look rotated\n(surprisingly, this phenomenon is not well known). This rotation is\nignored as an irrelevant optical phenomenon to yield the correct\nthought experiment visualization, which is the well-known Lorentz\ncontraction (Brown 2013).\n4.6 The Mental\u2013Model Account\n\nThe last of the many accounts that emerged in the discussion about\nthought experiments is what could be called the\n\u201cmental\u2013model account.\u201d It attracts the most\nfollowers (see Andreas 2011; Bishop 1998; Cooper 2005; Gendler 2004;\nPalmieri 2003; Nersessian 1992, 1993, 2007; McMullin 1985;\nMi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 1992, 2007, 2021). When we conduct a thought\nexperiment, according to champions of this view, we manipulate a\nmental model instead of the physical realm: \u201cThe general claim\nis that in certain problem-solving tasks people reason by constructing\na mental model of the situations, events, and processes that in\ndynamic cases can be manipulated through simulation\u201d (Nersessian\n2018, p. 319). Like physical models, mental models are\nnon-propositional in nature. This means first of all \u201cthat the\ncarefully crafted thought\u2013experimental narrative focuses on the\nconstruction of a model of a kind of situation and\nmanipulating that model through simulation affords epistemic access to\ncertain features of current representations in a way that manipulating\npropositional representations using logical rules cannot\u201d\n(Nersessian 2018, pp. 319\u2013320). A narrative functions as a kind\nof user-manual for building the model, but it isn\u2019t identical to\na thought experiment. The biggest problem for the mental\u2013model\naccount is to explain how something non-propositional like a mental\nmodel can make an impact on the propositional realm, which happens\nwhen a thought experiment causes a revision in beliefs.\n5. Going Forward\n\nThe mental\u2013model approach is one of the most promising of all\nthe accounts the literature on thought experiments has to offer, and\nthis for several reasons. First, it does not seem to be much of a\nstretch to draw connections to the intuition\u2013based account. In\nfact, intuitions maybe the missing link to connect the essentially\nnon-propositional activities surrounding mental models, on the one\nhand, and the propositional aspects of thought experiments, on the\nother. After all, thought experiments involve propositional reasoning,\nand somehow the non-propositional and propositional aspects of thought\nexperiments must be linked in any account of thought experiments. This\nis urgent insofar as thought experiments are credited with a\nmeaningful role in theory discovery and theory choice. Second, the\nmental\u2013model approach also allows for inclusion of important\nelements of experimentalism and the argument\u2013view. Thought\nexperiments are realized in the mind on mental models, and the method\nof variation is employed such that the results of the experiment may\nbe subject to a careful reconstruction of propositional lines of\nreasoning to submit it for careful assessment and critique. Third, the\nmental\u2013model approach enables us to bring an aspect into focus\nthat has been widely neglected in the discussion so far: the bodily\ncomponent of (thought) experiments. The exception is the work of the\nlate David Gooding (1992, 1993, 1994, and 1999). Fourth, in critical\nengagement with such naturalistic proposals, those theories of the\nbody may be put to work that the philosophical school of phenomenology\nhas produced (see Fehige and Wiltsche 2013). To be welcomed,\ntherefore, is the entry of phenomenology into the discussion on\nthought experiments (see Hopp 2014; Wiltsche 2018). Fifth, the\nmental\u2013model account also relates naturally to the most\nintriguing discussions about the role of literary fiction in thought\nexperiments.\n\nSome have placed \u201cliterary fiction on the level of thought\nexperiments\u201d (Swirski 2007, p. 6). There are two readings of\nsuch a claim. According to the first, some literary fiction may be of\ncognitive power due to the fact that they are thought experiments. In\nother words, we shouldn\u2019t outright reject the idea that\nliterature can be of cognitive value. Dystopian novels such as\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 and Huxley\u2019s Brave New\nWorld are obvious examples. According to the second reading, the\npower of thought experiments is partially a function of the narrative\nthat conveys it. The work of Novalis remains relevant for the\nexploration of this link between narrative development and thought\nexperiment: experimental writing and experiments on imagined scenarios\ngo hand in hand; words and thoughts coincide; mind and matter are\nentangled (see Daiber 2001). According to the mental\u2013model\napproach, both readings have a valid point. Literary fiction and\nnarratives of thought experiments can be powerful in establishing\nmental models in such a way that we can even learn new things about\nthe world at times from the fictional elements of them. The common\ndenominator is the work on mental models each may facilitate. It is in\nthis context that an appreciation can grow for Catherine Elgin\u2019s\ntheory of exemplification to argue against the \u201cvalorization of\ntruth in epistemology\u201d (2004, p. 113). This is also the place to\nconsider Andras Kertesz\u2019s (2015) work on conceptual metaphor\nresearch in its relevance to the epistemological puzzle that thought\nexperiments pose.\n\nFinally, sixth, mention could be made of visual reasoning in\nmathematics, which often seems closely related to thought experiments.\nThe standard view of mathematics is that the one and only source of\nevidence is a proof, and a proof is a derivation from axioms or first\nprinciples. Let\u2019s overlook the problem of where the first\nprinciples come from. A simple example such as the following casts\ndoubt on the standard view:\n\n\nTheorem: 1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + n = n2/2 + n/2\n\nProof: See Figure 7.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Picture proof.\n\n\nThe proof works like this: Start at the top and work down, letting the\nlittle squares represent numbers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. The\ntotal number of squares in the picture is equal to this sum. Notice\nalso that the numbers of squares is equal to a large square with sides\nof length 5 that is cut in half along the diagonal, i.e.,\n52/2, plus the shaded bits that were cut off by\nthe diagonal cut, i.e., 5/2. It is plausible to claim that\nthe diagram is a perfectly good proof of the theorem. One can\n\u201csee\u201d complete generality in the picture. Even though it\nonly illustrates the theorem for n = 5, somehow we can see\nthat it works for every number, all infinitely many of them. The\ndiagram does not implicitly suggest a \u201crigorous\u201d verbal or\nsymbolic proof. The regular proof of this theorem is by mathematical\ninduction, but the diagram does not correspond to an inductive proof\nat all, since the key element in an inductive proof is the passage\nfrom n to n + 1. The simple moral we could draw from\nthe example is just this: We can in special cases correctly infer\ntheorems from pictures, that is, from visualizable situations. There\nis an intuition and from this intuition we can grasp the truth of the\ntheorem (see Brown 1999 [2008]).\n\nOur assessment of the prospects of the mental\u2013model account is\nvery rough and speculative, though certainly not implausible. Of\ncourse, there are challenges to such a vision of a greater synthesis\nof the many different takes on thought experiments under the umbrella\nof the mental-model account. For example, some see additional support\narising for the argument\u2013view from computer simulations (see\nBeisbart 2012). Others find that \u201ccomputational modeling is\nlargely replacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only\na limited role in future practice of science, especially in the\nsciences of complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena\u201d (see\nChandrasekharan et al. 2012, p. 239). But, there are also\nproposals such as that by Marcus Schulzke (2014) to think of video\ngames philosophically as executable thought experiments. Whatever the\nmerits of this particular proposal, future explorations of the\nrelationship between computer simulations and thought experiments can\nbuild on outcomes of closer inquiries into it (see Behmel 2001, pp.\n98\u2013108; Di Paolo et al. 2000; El Skaf and Imbert 2013;\nLenhard 2011; St\u00e4udner 1998; Lenhard 2018). The work on the\nnature of the importance of scientific understanding (see, e.g.,\nStuart 2018) will inform that exploration as much as the fruits of\ncontinuing efforts to clarify the role of the imagination in thought\nexperiments (see, e.g., Meynell 2014; Stuart 2017 and 2021).\n\nWe conclude with an interesting, but still relatively unexplored issue\nthat concerns the relative importance of thought experiments in\ndifferent disciplines. Physics and philosophy use them extensively.\nChemistry, by contrast, seems to attract less attention in this\nrespect. Why is this the case? Perhaps it is merely an historical\naccident that chemists never developed a culture of doing thought\nexperiments. Perhaps it is tied to some deep feature of the discipline\nitself (see Snooks 2006). Economics and history use thought\nexperiments, but apparently not anthropology. A good explanation would\nlikely tell us a lot about the structure of these disciplines.\n\nRelated to this is the question of the difference, if any, between\nthought experiments in the sciences and those in philosophy. We have\nassumed throughout this entry that they are the same kind of thing.\nNot everyone sees them this way, so perhaps it should be considered an\nopen question. On the one hand, philosophy and science seem to many to\nbe different kinds of activities. That might suggest that thought\nexperiments would differ in the two areas. On the other hand, there is\na huge difference between thought experiments within a single field,\ne.g., Newton\u2019s bucket attempts to establish absolute space while\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat aims to show QM as then understood to be\nabsurd. Is the difference between them less than the difference\nbetween either of them and Searle\u2019s Chinese Room or\nThomson\u2019s violinist? The case one way or the other is not\nobvious. Of course, there are differences between constructive and\ndestructive thought experiments, but this is true within any\ndiscipline. Perhaps for now the default attitude ought to be that\nthere is no categorical difference between scientific and\nphilosophical thought experiments. This should not be treated as a\ndogmatic principle, but rather a stimulus to look deeper for important\nsubtle contrasts.\n",

        "raw_text": "<div id=\"bibliography\">\n<h2 id=\"Bib\">Bibliography</h2>\n<p>\nThe number of papers, anthologies, and monographs has been growing\nimmensely since the beginning of the 1990s. It might be useful to\nhighlight that in existing literature, K\u00fchne (2006) remains the\nmost substantial historical study on the philosophical exploration of\nthought experiments. And Sorensen (1992) remains the most\ncomprehensive philosophical study of thought experiments. More than\nother monographs both of these studies well exceed the author\u2019s\nown systematic contribution to what is widely considered the primary\nepistemological challenge presented by thought experiments. Also, this\nbibliography does not include the many (we count about eight) popular\nbooks on thought experiments (like <em>Wittgenstein\u2019s Beetle and\nOther Classical Thought Experiments</em> by Martin Cohen); nor do we\nlist fiction that is related to the subject (like <em>The End of Mr.\nY</em> by Scarlett Thomas, or <em>God\u2019s Debris</em> by Scott\nAdams). Further, for undergraduate teaching purposes one might want to\nconsider <em>Doing Philosophy: An Introduction Through Thought\nExperiments</em> (edited by Theodore Schick, Jr. and Lewis Vaughn,\nfifth edition, 2012, Boston: McGraw Hill Higher Education), and\nchapter 5 of Timothy Williamson\u2019s short introduction to\nphilosophical method (Oxford University Press, 2020). Moreover, a\nnumber of philosophical journals have dedicated part or all of an\nissue to the topic of thought experiments, including the <em>Croatian\nJournal of Philosophy</em> (19/VII, 2007), <em>Deutsche Zeitschrift\nf\u00fcr Philosophie</em> (1/59, 2011), <em>Informal Logic</em> (3/17,\n1995), <em>Philosophica</em> (1/72, 2003), <em>Perspectives on\nScience</em> (2/22, 2014), <em>Berichte zur\nWissenschaftsgeschichte</em> (1/38, 2015)), as well as <em>TOPOI</em>\n(4/38, 2019), <em>HOPOS</em> (1/11, 2021), and <em>Epistemologia</em>\n(12/2022). Furthermore, a companion to thought experiments exists now:\n<em>The Routledge Companion to Thought Experiments</em> was published\nin 2017. Each includes substantial state of the art reports. The\nbibliography that follows aims to list only publications that address\nthought experiments as such. Not included are the many specialized\npapers that discuss a particular thought experiment in its systematic\ncontribution to the discussion of a particular issue (such as\nPutnam\u2019s twin earth scenario to support semantic externalism).\nAn exception is made, of course, when such work is cited. Unlike in\nprevious versions of this entry, we no longer aim for\ncomprehensiveness in the bibliography that follows.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Aligica, Paul D., and Anthony J.
