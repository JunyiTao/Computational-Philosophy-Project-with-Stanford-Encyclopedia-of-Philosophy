    "main_text": "New Directions for Neutral Monism || Mind & Matter: A Merely Conceptual Distinction\n5.2 Mind & Matter: A Merely Conceptual Distinction\n\nFor want of a better label, John Heil presents his view on the\nmind-body relation as a form of neutral monism. He resists being\nlabeled a materialist\n\nbecause it carries with it the implication that there is an\nasymmetry in the identification of mental qualities with\nmaterial qualities: the mental is supplanted by the material. (Heil\n2013: 242)\n\n\nNor does he see himself as an idealist. And he has systematic and deep\nreasons for rejecting the property dualism that characterizes the\nvarious versions of nonreductive materialism. The neutral monism that\nhe accepts is characterized as follows:\n\n\nNeutral monism includes the denial that there is a\nmental\u2013material chasm to be bridged. The mental\u2013material\ndistinction is, as Spinoza and Donald Davidson contend, a distinction\nof conception only, not a real distinction, not a distinction\nin reality. (Heil 2013: 242)\n\n\nAn example will help to illustrate the gist of this view. Take the\nwell-worn claim that pain is c-fiber\n stimulation.[22]\n According to Heil, this says that the predicate \u201cc-fiber\nstimulation\u201d and the predicate \u201cpain\u201d apply to the\nsame things: all things that are truly described as being c-fiber\nstimulations are also truly described as pains. But\u2014and this is\na crucial claim that cannot be developed here\u2014this does\nnot mean that there is a property of being a c-fiber\nstimulation and a property of being a pain, and that these two\nproperties stand in some interesting relationship, such as identity,\nreduction, realization, etc. What this does mean is that there is a\ncomplex object that makes both of these claims true. The nature of the\nparts of this object, as well as their intricate relationships to one\nanother, is the reality that is correctly described as a c-fiber\nstimulation and as a pain.\n\nThis part of Heil\u2019s account appears to be consistent with the\nspirit of traditional neutral monism. One is reminded of\nRussell\u2019s pithy description of his project: \u201cWhat I wish\nto do in this essay is to restate the relations of mind and brain in\nterms not implying the existence of either\u201d (Russell 1956a:\n145). This can easily be read as a denial of the existence of a chasm\nbetween mental and physical properties. And Heil\u2019s complex\nobjects that serve as the truth-makers for mental and physical\ndescriptions may be seen as analogous to Russell\u2019s groups\n(logical constructions) of events that can properly be described in\nphysical and mental terms.\n\nBut there is an additional part to the neutral monist\npicture\u2014one that (arguably) all of the mainline neutral monists\nagree on\u2014that Heil rejects. When he tells the \u201cdeep\nstory\u201d (Heil\u2019s term) about the nature of the complex\nobjects (the truth-makers for claims about c-fibers and pains etc.),\nhe turns to fundamental physics:\n\nI take it to be an empirical question\u2014a question for science,\nfor fundamental physics\u2014what the substances are and what they\nare like, how they are. (Heil 2013: 201\u20132)\n\n\nSo the basic constituents of the world\u2014the substances and the\nproperties\u2014that Heil describes are physical. Here the\nneutral monist (who is committed to the Neither View of\nneutrality) parts company with Heil. The deep story of the neutral\nmonist has it that the fundamental entities\u2014be they events, bits\nof information, substances, properties, etc.\u2014are not physical\n(and not mental, of course). That is to say, they are not the sort of\nthing that fundamental physics (or psychology) reveals.\n",
