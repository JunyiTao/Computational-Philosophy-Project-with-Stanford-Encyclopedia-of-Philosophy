    "main_text": "Transcendence of the Ego: The Discovery of Intentionality\n2. Transcendence of the Ego: The Discovery of Intentionality\n\nOne of the most famous foundational moments of existentialism concerns\nSartre\u2019s discovery of phenomenology around the turn of 1932/3,\nwhen in a Parisian bar listening to his friend Raymond Aron\u2019s\ndescription of an apricot cocktail (de Beauvoir 1960 [1962: 135]).\nFrom this moment, Sartre was fascinated by the originality and novelty\nof Husserl\u2019s method, which he identified straight away as a\nmeans to fulfil his own philosophical expectations: overcoming the\nopposition between idealism and realism; getting a view on the world\nthat would allow him \u201cto describe objects just as he saw and\ntouched them, and extract philosophy from the process\u201d. Sartre\nbecame immediately acquainted with Emmanuel Levinas\u2019s early\ntranslation of Husserl\u2019s Cartesian Meditations and his\nintroductory book on Husserl\u2019s theory of intuition. He spent the\nfollowing year in Berlin, so as to study more closely Husserl\u2019s\nmethod and to familiarise himself with the works of his students,\nHeidegger and Scheler. With Levinas, and then later with\nMerleau-Ponty, Ric\u0153ur, and Tran Duc Thao, Sartre became one of\nthe first serious interpreters and proponent of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology in France.\n\nWhile he was studying in Berlin, Sartre tried to convert his study of\nHusserl into an article that documents his enthusiastic discovery of\nintentionality. It was published a few years later under the title\n\u201cIntentionality: a fundamental idea of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology\u201d. This article, which had considerable influence\nover the early French reception of phenomenology, makes explicit the\nreasons Sartre had to be fascinated by Husserl\u2019s descriptive\napproach to consciousness, and how he managed to merge it with his\nprevious philosophical concerns. Purposefully leaving aside the\nidealist aspects of Husserl\u2019s transcendental phenomenology,\nSartre proposes a radicalisation of intentionality that stresses its\nanti-idealistic potential. Against the French contemporary versions of\nneo-Kantianism (Brochard, Lachelier), and more particularly against\nthe kind of idealism advocated by L\u00e9on Brunschvicg, Sartre\nfamously claims that intentionality allows us to discard the\nmetaphysical oppositions between the inner and outer and to renounce\nto the very notion of the interiority of consciousness. If it is true,\nas Husserl states, that every consciousness is consciousness\nof something, and if intentionality accounts for this\nfundamental direction that orients consciousness towards its object\nand beyond itself, then, Sartre concludes, the phenomenological\ndescription of intentionality does away with the illusion that makes\nus responsible for the way the world appears to us. According to\nSartre\u2019s radicalised reading of Husserl\u2019s thesis,\nintentionality is intrinsically realistic: it lets the world appear to\nconsciousness as it really is, and not as a mere correlate of\nan intellectual act. This realistic interpretation, being perfectly in\ntune with Sartre\u2019s lifelong ambition to provide a philosophical\naccount of the contingency of being\u2014its non-negotiable lack of\nnecessity\u2014convinced him to adopt Husserl\u2019s method of\nphenomenological description. \n\nWhile he was still in Berlin, Sartre also began to work on a more\npersonal essay, which a few years later resulted in his first\nsignificant philosophical contribution, Transcendence of the\nEgo. With this influential essay Sartre engages in a much more\ncritical way with the conception of the \u201ctranscendental\nego\u201d presented in Husserl\u2019s Ideas and defends his\nrealistic interpretation of intentionality against the idealistic\ntendencies of Husserl\u2019s own phenomenology after the publication\nof Logical Investigations. Stressing the irreducible\ntransparency of intentional experience\u2014its fundamental\norientation beyond itself towards its object, whatever this object may\nbe\u2014Sartre distinguishes between the dimensions of our subjective\nexperiences that are pre-reflectively lived through, and the\nreflective stance thanks to which one can always make their experience\nthe intentional object towards which consciousness is oriented. One of\nSartre\u2019s most fundamental claims in Transcendence of the\nEgo is that these two forms of consciousness cannot and must not\nbe mistaken with one another: reflexive consciousness is a form of\nintentional consciousness that takes one\u2019s own lived-experiences\nas its specific object, whereas pre-reflexive consciousness need not\ninvolve the intentional distance to the object that the act of\nreflection entails. In regard to self-consciousness, Sartre argues\nthere is an immediate and non-cognitive form of self-awareness, as\nwell as reflective forms of self-consciousness. The latter is unable\nto give access to oneself as the subject of unreflected\nconsciousness, but only as the intentional object of the act\nof reflection, i.e., the Ego in Sartre\u2019s terminology. The Ego is\nthe specific object that intentional consciousness is directed upon\nwhen performing reflection\u2014an object that consciousness\n\u201cposits and grasps [\u2026] in the same act\u201d (Sartre\n1936a [1957: 41; 2004: 5]), and that is constituted in and by the act\nof reflection (Sartre 1936a [1957: 80\u20131; 2004: 20]). Instead of\na transcendental subject, the Ego must consequently be understood as a\ntranscendent object similar to any other object, with the only\ndifference that it is given to us through a particular kind of\nexperience, i.e., reflection. The Ego, Sartre argues, \u201cis\noutside, in the world. It is a being of the world, like the\nEgo of another\u201d (Sartre 1936a [1957: 31; 2004: 1]).\n\nThis critique of the transcendental Ego is less opposed to Husserl\nthan it may seem, notwithstanding Sartre\u2019s reservations about\nthe transcendental radicalisation of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology.\nThe neo-Humean claim that the \u201cI\u201d or Ego is nowhere to be\nfound \u201cwithin\u201d ourselves remains faithful to the 5th\nLogical Investigation, in which Husserl had initially\nfollowed the very same line of reasoning (see Husserl 1901 [2001: vol.\n2, 91\u201393]), before developing a transcendental methodology that\nsubstantially modified his approach to subjectivity (as exposed in\nparticular in Husserl 1913 [1983]). However, for the Husserl of the\nIdeas Pertaining to a Phenomenology (published in 1913), the\nsense in which a perceptual object, which is necessarily seen from one\nside but also presented to us as a unified object (involving other\nunseen sides), requires that there be a unifying structure within\nconsciousness itself: the transcendental ego. Sartre argues that such\nan account would entail that the perception of an object would always\nalso involve an intermediary perception\u2014such as some kind of\nperception or consciousness of the transcendental ego\u2014thus\nthreatening to disrupt the \u201ctransparency\u201d or\n\u201ctranslucidity\u201d of consciousness. All forms of perception\nand consciousness would involve (at least) these two components, and\nthere would be an opaqueness to consciousness that is not\nphenomenologically apparent. In addition, it appears that\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental ego would have to pre-exist all of our\nparticular actions and perceptions, which is something that the\nexistentialist dictum \u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d, which\nwe will explicate shortly, seems committed to denying. Without\nconsidering here the extent to which Husserl can be defended against\nthese charges, Sartre\u2019s general claim is that the notion of a\nself or ego is not given in experience. Rather, it is something that\nis not immanent but transcendent to pre-reflective experience. The Ego\nis the transcendent object of one\u2019s reflexive\nexperience, and not the subject of the pre-reflective experience that\nwas initially lived (but not known).\n\nSartre devotes a great deal of effort to establishing the impersonal\n(or \u201cpre-personal\u201d) character of consciousness, which\nstems from its non-egological structure and results directly from the\nabsence of the I in the transcendental field. According to\nhim, intentional (positional) consciousness typically involves an\nanonymous and \u201cimpersonal\u201d relation to a transcendent\nobject: \n\n\nWhen I run after a streetcar, when I look at the time, when I am\nabsorbed in contemplating a portrait, there is no I.\n[\u2026] In fact I am plunged in the world of objects; it is they\nwhich constitute the unity of my consciousness; [\u2026] but\nme, I have disappeared; I have annihilated myself. There is\nno place for me on this level. (Sartre 1936a [1957: 49; 2004:\n8]) \n\n\nThe tram appears to me in a specific way (as\n\u201chaving-to-be-overtaken\u201d, in this case) that is\nexperienced as its own mode of phenomenalization, and not as\na mere relational aspect of its appearing to me. The object\npresents itself as carrying a set of objective properties that are\nstrictly independent from one\u2019s personal relation to it. The\nstreetcar is experienced as a transcendent object, in a way that\nobliterates and overrides, so to speak, the subjective\nfeatures of conscious experience; its\n\u201chaving-to-be-overtaken-ness\u201d does not belong to my\nsubjective experience of the world but to the\nobjective description of the way the world is (see also\nSartre 1936a [1957: 56; 2004: 10\u201311]). When I run after the\nstreetcar, my consciousness is absorbed in the relation to its\nintentional object, \u201cthe\nstreetcar-having-to-be-overtaken\u201d, and there is no trace of\nthe \u201cI\u201d in such lived-experience. I do not need to be\naware of my intention to take the streetcar, since the object itself\nappears as having-to-be-overtaken, and the subjective properties of my\nexperience disappear in the intentional relation to the object. They\nare lived-through without any reference to the experiencing subject\n(or to the fact that this experience has to be experienced by\nsomeone). This particular feature derives from the diaphanousness\nof lived-experiences. In a different example of this, Sartre argues\nthat when I perceive Pierre as loathsome, say, I do not perceive my\nfeeling of hatred; rather, Pierre repulses me and I experience\nhim as repulsive (Sartre 1936a [1957: 63\u20134; 2004: 13]).\nRepulsiveness constitutes an essential feature of his\ndistinctive mode of appearing, rather than a trait of my\nfeelings towards him. Sartre concludes that reflective statements\nabout one\u2019s Ego cannot be logically derived from non-reflective\n(\u201cirr\u00e9fl\u00e9chies\u201d) lived-experiences:\n\n\n\nThus to say \u201cI hate\u201d or \u201cI love\u201d on the\noccasion of a singular consciousness of attraction or repulsion, is to\ncarry out a veritable passage to the infinite [\u2026] Nothing more\nis needed for the rights of reflection to be singularly limited: it is\ncertain that Pierre repulses me, yet it is and will remain forever\ndoubtful that I hate him. Indeed, this affirmation infinitely exceeds\nthe power of reflection. (Sartre 1936a [1957: 63\u20134; 2004: 13])\n\n\n\nThis critique of the powers of reflection forms one important part of\nSartre\u2019s argument for the primacy of pre-reflective\nconsciousness over reflective consciousness, which is central to many\nof the pivotal arguments of Being and Nothingness, as we\nindicate in the relevant sections below.\n",
