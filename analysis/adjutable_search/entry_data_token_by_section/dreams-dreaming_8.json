    "main_text": "The ontology of dreams || Dreams and hallucinations\n2.4 Dreams and hallucinations\n\nEven where philosophers agree dreams are experiences, they often\ndisagree on how exactly to characterize dreaming relative to\nwake-state psychological terms. Often, questions about the ontology of\ndreaming intersect with epistemological issues. Increasingly, they\nalso incorporate empirical findings.\n\nThe standard view is that dreams have the same phenomenal character as\nwaking perception in that they seemingly put us in contact with\nmind-independent objects, yet no such object is actually being\nperceived. This means dreams count as hallucinations in the\nphilosophical sense (Crane & French 2017; Macpherson 2013). Even\nif, in a particularly realistic dream, my visual experience was\nexactly as it would be if I were awake (I could see my bedroom, my\nhands on the bed sheets, etc.), as long as my eyes were closed during\nthe episode, I would not, literally, be seeing anything.\n\nThere is some controversy in the psychological literature about\nwhether dreams should be regarded as hallucinations. Some believe the\nterm hallucination should be reserved for clinical contexts and\nwake-state pathologies (Aleman & Lar\u00f8i 2008: 17; but see\nffytche 2007; ffytche et al. 2010).\n\nThe view that dreams involve hallucinations is implicit in\nDescartes\u2019 assumption that even when dreaming,\n\n\nit is certain that I seem to see light, hear a noise, and feel heat;\nthis cannot be false, and this is what in me is properly called\nperceiving (sentire). (Descartes 1641: II.9) \n\n\nIt also lies at the heart of Aristotle\u2019s (On Dreams)\nassumption that dreams result from the movements of the sensory organs\nthat continue even after the original stimulus has ceased. He believed\nthat in the silence of sleep, these residual movements result in vivid\nsensory imagery that is subjectively indistinguishable from genuine\nperception (see also Dreisbach 2000; Barbera 2008).\n\nThe assumption of phenomenological equivalence between dream and\nwaking experience can also be found in Berkeley\u2019s (1710: I.18)\nidealist claim that the existence of external bodies is not necessary\nfor the production of vivid, wake-like perceptual experience.\nSimilarly, Russell defended sense-data theory by noting that in\ndreams, \n\n\nI have all the experiences that I seem to have; it is only things\noutside my mind that are not as I believe them to be while I am\ndreaming. (Russell 1948: 149\u2013150) \n\n\nElsewhere, he argued dreams and waking life\n\n\nmust be treated with equal respect; it is only by some reality not\nmerely sensible that dreams can be condemned. (Russell 1914:\n69) \n\n\nHume was less clear on this matter, proposing that dreams occupy an\nintermediate position between vivid and largely non-voluntary sensory\nimpressions and ideas, or \u201cthe faint images of previous\nimpressions in thinking and reasoning\u201d (Hume 1739: 1.1.1.1). On\nthe one hand, as mere creatures of the mind, Hume wanted to categorize\ndreams as ideas. On the other hand, he acknowledged that in sleep,\n\u201cour ideas can approach the vivacity of sensory\nimpressions\u201d (Hume 1739: 1.1.1.1). Dreams do not fit comfortably\ninto Hume\u2019s attempt to draw a dichotomous distinction between\nimpressions, including perception, and ideas, including sensory\nimagination (Ryle 1949; Waxman 1994; Broughton 2006).\n\nPhenomenologists often focus not so much on the quality of dream\nimagery as on the overall character of experience, noting that dreams\nare experienced as reality; as in waking perception, we simply feel\npresent in a world. This also sets dreams apart from waking fantasy\nand daydreams (Husserl 1904/1905; Uslar 1964; Conrad 1968; Globus\n1987: 89. \n\nAt its strongest, the hallucination view claims that dreaming and\nwaking experience are identical in both the quality of sensory imagery\nand their overall, self-in-a-world structure (Revonsuo 2006: 84). This\nclaim is central to the virtual reality metaphor, according\nto which consciousness itself is dreamlike and waking perception a\nkind of online hallucination modulated by the senses (Llin\u00e1s\n& Ribary 1994; Llin\u00e1s & Par\u00e9 1991; Revonsuo\n2006; Metzinger 2003, 2009).\n\nThis seems to be empirically supported. Neuroimaging studies (Dang-Vu\net al. 2007; Nir & Tononi 2010; Desseilles et al. 2011) show that\nthe predominance of visual and motor imagery as well as strong\nemotions in dreams is paralleled by high activation of the\ncorresponding brain areas in REM sleep, which may exceed waking; at\nthe same time, the cognitive deficits often thought to characterize\ndreams such as the loss of self-awareness, the absence of critical\nthinking, delusional reasoning, and mnemonic deficits fit in well with\nthe comparative deactivation of frontal areas (Hobson et al. 2000).\nHobson (1988, Hobson et al. 2000) has argued that the vivid,\nhallucinatory character of dreaming results from the fact that in REM\nsleep, the visual and motor areas are activated in the same way as in\nwaking perception, the sole difference being dreams\u2019 dependence on\ninternal signal generation. Horikawa and colleagues (2013) used\nneuroimaging data from sleep onset to predict the types of objects\ndescribed in mentation reports, which they took to support the\nperceptual equivalence between dreaming and waking. \n\nGenerally, versions of the hallucination view that suggest dreams\nreplicate all aspects of waking perception are too vague to be\ninformative. Especially for subtle perceptual activities (such as\nvisual search), we might not know enough about dream phenomenology to\nmake any strong claims (Nielsen 2010). Specifying points of similarity\nleads to a more informative and precise, but likely also more nuanced\nview. Dreams are heterogeneous, and some might be more perception-like\nwhile others resemble imagination (Windt 2015a). There might also be\ndifferences between or even within specific types of imagery. For\nexample, visual imagery might be quite different from touch\nsensations, which tend to be rare in dreams (Hobson 1988). Visual\ndream imagery might overall resemble waking perception but lack color\nsaturation, background detail and focus (Rechtschaffen &\nBuchignani, 1992). Classifying dreams as either hallucinatory or\nimaginative is further complicated by the fact that there is strong\noverlap in cortical activity associated with both visual imagery and\nperception (Zeidman & Maguire, 2016). This means even a strong\noverlap in cortical activity between, say, visual dream imagery and\nvisual perception does not necessarily set dreaming apart from waking\nimagination.\n\nThis is also true for evidence on eye movements in dreams. LaBerge and\ncolleagues (2018) recently showed that eye tracking of objects is\nsmooth in lucid dreaming and perceiving, but not in imagining. Drawing\nfrom this evidence, Rosen (forthcoming) suggests many dreams mimic the\nphenomenology of interacting with a stable world, including eye\nmovements and visual search. Others argue we should not analogize\ndream imagery to mind-independent, scannable objects and that eye\nmovements might instead be implicated in the generation of dream\nimagery (Windt 2018).\n",
