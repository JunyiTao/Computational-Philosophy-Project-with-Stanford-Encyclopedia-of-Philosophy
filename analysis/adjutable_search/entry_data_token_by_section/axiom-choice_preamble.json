    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe principle of set theory known as the Axiom of Choice has\nbeen hailed as \u201cprobably the most interesting and, in spite of\nits late appearance, the most discussed axiom of mathematics, second\nonly to Euclid\u2019s axiom of parallels which was introduced more than two\nthousand years ago\u201d (Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel & Levy 1973,\n\u00a7II.4). The fulsomeness of this description might lead those\nunfamiliar with the axiom to expect it to be as startling as, say, the\nPrinciple of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light or the Heisenberg\nUncertainty Principle. But in fact the Axiom of Choice as it is\nusually stated appears humdrum, even self-evident. For it amounts to\nnothing more than the claim that, given any collection of mutually\ndisjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set\u2014a\ntransversal or choice set\u2014containing exactly\none element from each member of the given collection. Nevertheless,\nthis seemingly innocuous principle has far-reaching mathematical\nconsequences\u2014many indispensable, some startling\u2014and\nhas come to figure prominently in discussions on the foundations of\nmathematics. It (or its equivalents) have been employed in countless\nmathematical papers, and a number of monographs have been exclusively\ndevoted to it.\n",
