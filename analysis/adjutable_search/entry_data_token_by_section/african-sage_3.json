Ethnophilosophy, Unanimity and African Critical Thought\n\nAlthough it had been used previously by other writers, the term\n\u201cethnophilosophy\u201d acquired its notoriety in the work of\nthe Beninois philosopher Paulin Hountondji (1970, 1983). Perhaps\nunaware that the term had been used earlier, Hountondji criticized the\nBelgian missionary, Placide Tempels\u2019 book, Bantu Philosophy\n(first French ed. 1945, and Eng. tr. 1959), as well as his disciples,\namong them the French philosopher and ethnographer Marcel Griaule, the\nRwandais philosopher Alexis Kagame, and the Kenyan theologian John\nMbiti, for casting African philosophy as an anonymous system of\nthought, without individual thinkers to claim or account for it. By\nthe end of the 1960s, the positive reception in Anglophone Africa, not\nonly of Tempels\u2019 Bantu Philosophy, but also John Mbiti\u2019s African\nReligions and Philosophy (1969) and Marcel Griaule\u2019s\nConversations with Ogotemm\u00eali that had recently been\ntranslated into English (1965), coincided with the rising tides of\npolitical and cultural nationalism throughout the continent.\n\nThe third negative claim Oruka aimed to challenge pertains to the\nphilosophical status of indigenous African thought. Ethnophilosophy\nhad falsely popularized the view that traditional Africa was a place\nof philosophical unanimity and that African traditions encouraged\nunanimity regarding beliefs and values. If this were true it would\nallow no room for individual thinkers like, say, Socrates or\nDescartes, with their own independent views on such matters. Oruka was\nconcerned that African intellectuals were drawn into this false\nassumption regarding the intellectual inclination of African people,\nmaintaining the belief that critique is absent from indigenous African\nthought. This situation was worsened by the new political movements of\npostindependence African nations where one-party political systems\nsprang up. By outlawing opposition politics as being both unAfrican\nand antinationalist, political leaders often appealed to this view of\nunanimity. The Sage Philosophy project objected to this claim\nregarding unanimity in Africa, which Oruka regarded as absurd, by\npresenting empirical evidence of the diversity of thought among\nindigenous thinkers. Oruka insisted that, while rulers everywhere will\nalways crave unanimity, thinkers thrive in dialogue and diversity of\nopinion. He pointed out that Sage philosophy was about thinkers, not\nrulers.\n\nOruka\u2019s desire to distinguish Sage philosophy from ethnophilosophy was\nalso in response to another false view, partly created by\nethnophilosophy, that indigenous African thought is anonymous. An\nimportant charge against ethnophilosophy has been that, by simply\npresenting the teachings of African beliefs in the allegorical modes,\nthe impression is created that indigenous African modes of thought are\ndeeply grounded in their mythical representations of reality, thus\nleaving the philosophic ideas largely unexplained. With this in mind,\nOruka\u2019s project aimed to counter two types of false perception of\nindigenous African thought. First, he separated the myths from the\nclearly thought out and logically valid philosophical ideas of\nindigenous individual thinkers to make clear what he frequently\nreferred to as the \u201canthropological fogs\u201d (Sage\nPhilosophy, pp. xxi-xxix). Secondly, he contested the idea that a\nqualitative mental leap from myth is required for Africans to embrace\nphilosophical thought. Such a view had been expressed by the Belgian\nphilosopher Franz Crahay in a widely read article, \u201cLe\nd\u00e9collage conceptuel: conditions d\u2019une philosophie\nbantoue\u201d (1965). Although he was critical of ethnophilosophy,\nHountondji was the first philosopher to distance himself from Crahay\u2019s\nposition, arguing that local knowledge systems were already separate\nfrom myths, as no humans can live on myths. Moral principles, for\nexample, would have to be abstract in character to be applicable in\ngeneral terms beyond one person (Hountondji 1970). According to Wiredu\n(1996: 182ff), such independent and critical thinking was available in\nvarying forms in Akan communities and was the basis of frequently\nprotracted disputations among elders in search of a consensus\nregarding matters that required negotiations. Thus, contrary to the\nview that knowledge at the communal level was anonymous, Wiredu argues\nthat it is precisely in regard to the importance of consensus on\nmatters of common good that disputation and careful navigation through\ndifferent opinions was not just considered to be crucial, but was put\non transparent display until some form of consensus was attained. In\nother words, consensus was not imposed, but relentlessly pursued. Such\nimportant matters like just claims to different kinds of rights were\nnot adjudicated without the input of those members of community who\nwere well regarded for their independent opinions.\n\nAnother point that Oruka makes against the perception of unanimity in\nAfrican traditional thought can be found in the expressions of\nthinkers whose ideas are grounded in critical analysis and evaluation\nof everyday experiences in their communities. Another example of this,\nbesides such figures as Paulo Mbuya Akoko and others who Oruka\nmentions and discusses in the book Sage Philosophy is the\nfamous Swahili poet, critic, and philosopher Shabaan bin Robert from\nthen Tanganyika, now Tanzania. Shabaan, famed as a pioneer in the\ninterface between the oral and the written traditions, has established\na unique legacy as an indigenous independent thinker, whose focus in\nhis written work was to theorize about metaphysical and social ideals.\nAbout the former, Shabaan theorizes in his work entitled Utubora\nMkulima the attributes of ideal personhood by arguing strongly,\nin a dialogical setting, that an ideal person is one whose moral\nrighteousness is aimed at being a perfect member of community, and\ntherefore his concerns for common good supersede individual interests\n(pp. 26\u201328). Regarding social ideals, Shabaan argues in\nKusadikika that a good society is defined as one in which all\nmembers are accorded their basic rights and treated with equality\nregardless of gender, age, or social status (pp. 29\u201343). This makes\nShabaan Robert an example of a liberal thinker whose ideas bridge\nbetween indigenous or pre-colonial social structures and values, and\nthe so-called modern society whose values were significantly\ninfluenced by colonial occupations and interests, as well as new\neconomic, political, and moral values. In these senses, Shabaan Robert\nthought and works complement those of other indigenous thinkers in\ncritiquing both indigenous and new modes of existence. To Oruka, these\nare signs that indigeneity is not, as is widely but falsely thought,\nsynonymous with anonymity and stagnation in thought.\n",
