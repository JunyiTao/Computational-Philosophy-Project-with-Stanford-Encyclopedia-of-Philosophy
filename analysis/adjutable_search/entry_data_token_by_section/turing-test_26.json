    "main_text": "The Chinese Room\n6. The Chinese Room\n\nThere are many different objections to The Turing Test which have\nsurfaced in the literature during the past fifty years, but which we\nhave not yet discussed. We cannot hope to canvass all of these\nobjections here. However, there is one argument\u2014Searle\u2019s\n\u201cChinese Room\u201d argument\u2014that is mentioned so often\nin connection with the Turing Test that we feel obliged to end with\nsome discussion of it.\n\nIn Minds, Brains and Programs and elsewhere, John Searle\nargues against the claim that \u201cappropriately programmed\ncomputers literally have cognitive states\u201d (64). Clearly enough,\nSearle is here disagreeing with Turing\u2019s claim that an\nappropriately programmed computer could think. There is much that is\ncontroversial about Searle\u2019s argument; we shall just consider\none way of understanding what it is that he is arguing\nfor.\n\nThe basic structure of Searle\u2019s argument is very well known. We\ncan imagine a \u201chand simulation\u201d of an intelligent\nagent\u2014in the case described, a speaker of a Chinese\nlanguage\u2014in circumstances in which we might well be very\nreluctant to allow that there is any appropriate intelligence lying\nbehind the simulated behavior. (Thus, what we are invited to suppose\nis a logical possibility is not so very different from what Block\ninvites us to suppose is a logical possibility. However, the argument\nthat Searle goes on to develop is rather different from the argument\nthat Block defends.) Moreover\u2014and this is really the\nkey point for Searle\u2019s argument\u2014the \u201chand\nsimulation\u201d in question is, in all relevant respects, simply a\nspecial kind of digital computation. So, there is a possible\nworld\u2014doubtless one quite remote from the actual world\u2014in\nwhich a digital computer simulates intelligence but in which the\ndigital computer does not itself possess intelligence. But, if we\nconsider any digital computer in the actual world, it will not differ\nfrom the computer in that remote possible world in any way which could\nmake it the case that the computer in the actual world is more\nintelligent than the computer in that remote possible world. Given\nthat we agree that the \u201chand simulating\u201d computer in the\nChinese Room is not intelligent, we have no option but to conclude\nthat digital computers are simply not the kinds of things that\ncan be intelligent.\n\nSo far, the argument that we have described arrives at the conclusion\nthat no appropriately programmed computer can think. While this\nconclusion is not one that Turing accepted, it is important to note\nthat it is compatible with the claim that The Turing Test is a good\ntest for intelligence. This is because, for all that has been argued,\nit may be that it is not nomically possible to provide any\n\u201chand simulation\u201d of intelligence (and, in particular,\nthat it is not possible to simulate intelligence using any kind of\ncomputer). In order to turn Searle\u2019s argument\u2014at least in\nthe way in which we have developed it\u2014into an objection to The\nTuring Test, we need to have some reason for thinking that it is at\nleast nomically possible to simulate intelligence using\ncomputers. (If it is nomically impossible to simulate intelligence\nusing computers, then the alleged fact that digital computers cannot\ngenuinely possess intelligence casts no doubt at all on the usefulness\nof the Turing Test, since digital computers are nomically disqualified\nfrom the range of cases in which there is mere simulation of\nintelligence.) In the absence of reason to believe this, the most that\nSearle\u2019s argument yields is an objection to Turing\u2019s\nconfidently held belief that digital computing machines will one day\npass The Turing Test. (Here, as elsewhere, we are supposing that, for\nany kind of creature C, there is a version of The Turing Test in which\nC takes the role of the machine in the specific test that Turing\ndescribes. This general format for testing for the presence of\nintelligence would not necessarily be undermined by the success of\nSearle\u2019s Chinese Room argument.)\n\nThere are various responses that might be made to the argument that we\nhave attributed to Searle. One kind of response is to dispute the\nclaim that there is no intelligence present in the case of the Chinese\nRoom. (Suppose that the \u201chand simulation\u201d is embedded in a\nrobot that is equipped with appropriate sensors, etc. Suppose,\nfurther, that the \u201chand simulation\u201d involves updating the\nprocess of \u201chand simulation,\u201d etc. If enough details of\nthis kind are added, then it becomes quite unclear whether we do want\nto say that we still haven\u2019t described an intelligent system.)\nAnother kind of response is to dispute the claim that digital\ncomputers in the actual world could not be relevantly different from\nthe system that operates in the Chinese Room in that remote possible\nworld. (If we suppose that the core of the Chinese Room is a kind of\ngiant look-up table, then it may well be important to note that\ndigital computers in the actual world do not work with look-up tables\nin that kind of way.) Doubtless there are other possible lines of\nresponse as well. However, it would take us out of our way to try to\ntake this discussion further. (One good place to look for further\ndiscussion of these matters is Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson\n(1996).)\n",
