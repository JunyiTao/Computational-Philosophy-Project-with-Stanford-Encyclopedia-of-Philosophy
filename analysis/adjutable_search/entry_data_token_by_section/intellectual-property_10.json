    "main_text": "Justifications and Critiques || Personality-Based Justifications of Intellectual Property\n3.1 Personality-Based Justifications of Intellectual Property\n\nRather than focusing on incentives and consequences or labor and merit\n(see utilitarian and Lockean arguments below), the personality\ntheorist argues that intellectual property is an extension of\nindividual personality. Personality theorists such as Hegel maintain\nthat individuals have moral claims to their own talents, feelings,\ncharacter traits, and experiences. We are self-owners in this sense.\nControl over physical and intellectual objects is essential for\nself-actualization\u2014by expanding our selves outward beyond our\nown minds and mixing these selves with tangible and intangible items,\nwe both define ourselves and obtain control over our goals and\nprojects. For Hegel, the external actualization of the human will\nrequires property (Hegel 1821). Property rights are important in two\nways according to this view. First, by controlling and manipulating\nobjects, both tangible and intangible, our will takes form in the\nworld and we obtain a measure of freedom. Individuals may use their\nphysical and intellectual property rights, for example, to shield\ntheir private lives from public scrutiny and to facilitate life-long\nproject pursuit. Second, in some cases our personality becomes fused\nwith an object\u2014thus moral claims to control feelings, character\ntraits, and experiences may be expanded to intangible works (Humboldt\n1792; Kohler 1969).\n\nThe right of divulgation, when and if an intellectual work is placed\nbefore the public, is grounded in justified possession or prior\nentitlements over the work in question and the wrongness of compelling\nspeech.  A central wrong-making feature of violating the\nrights of attribution and integrity is that, in the typical case, a\nkind of misrepresentation or fraud occurs. For example, when\nSmith changes a painting by Jones without notice, there is a\nmisrepresentation being offered. As with attribution and\nintegrity, the right of withdraw could be protected by contracts\nthat determine the downstream uses of intellectual works.\n3.1.1 Problems for Personality-Based Justifications of Intellectual Property\n\nThere are at least four problems with this view (Hughes 1988; Palmer\n2005; Schroeder 2006). First, it is not clear that we own our\nfeelings, character traits, and experiences. While it is true that we\nhave possession of these things or that they are a part of each of us,\nan argument is needed to establish the relevant moral claims.\n\nSecond, even if it could be established that individuals own or have\nmoral claims to their personality, it does not automatically follow\nthat such claims are expanded when personalities become infused in\ntangible or intangible works. Rather than establishing property claims\nto such works, perhaps we should view this as an abandonment of\npersonality\u2014similar to the sloughing off of hair and skin cells.\nMoreover, misrepresenting an intellectual work (assuming there are no\nmoral rights to these expressions) might change the perception of an\nauthor\u2019s personality, but it would not in fact change their\npersonality.\n\nThird, assuming that moral claims to personality could be expanded to\ntangible or intangible items, we would still need an argument\njustifying property rights. Personality-based moral claims may warrant\nnothing more than use rights or prohibitions against alteration.\nFinally, there are many intellectual innovations in which there is no\nevidence of a creator\u2019s personality\u2014a list of customers or\na new safety-pin design, for instance (Hughes 1988). Given these\nchallenges, personality-based theories may not provide a strong moral\nfoundation for legal systems of intellectual property.\n3.1.2 The Personality Theorist\u2019s Rejoinder\n\nEven if we acknowledge the force of these objections, there does seem\nto be something intuitively appealing about personality-based theories\nof intellectual property rights. Suppose, for example, that Mr. Friday\nbuys a painting at a garage sale\u2014a long-lost Crusoe original.\nFriday takes the painting home and alters the painting with a marker,\ndrawing horns and mustaches on the figures in the painting. The\nadditions are so clever and fit so nicely into the painting that\nFriday hangs it in a window on a busy street. There are at least two\nethical worries to consider in this case. First, the alterations by\nFriday may cause unjustified economic damage to Crusoe. Second, and\nindependent of the economic considerations, Friday\u2019s actions may\ndamage Crusoe\u2019s reputation. The integrity of the painting has\nbeen violated without the consent of the author, perhaps causing\nlong-term damage to his reputation and community standing. If these\nclaims are sensible, then it appears that we are acknowledging\npersonality-based moral \u201cstrings\u201d attaching to certain\nintellectual works. By producing intellectual works, authors and\ninventors put themselves on display, so-to-speak, and incur certain\nrisks. Intellectual property rights afford authors and inventors a\nmeasure of control over this risk. To put the point a different way,\nit is the moral claims that attach to personality, reputation, and the\nphysical embodiments of these individual goods that justify legal\nrules covering damage to reputation and certain sorts of economic\nlosses.\n\nThere is also the issue of compelled speech. Friday, in this\nexample, is misrepresenting Crusoe and compelling him to discuss\nthe changes, integrity, and original intent of the intellectual\nwork. Instances of plagiarism and forgery are also example of\nmisrepresentation and fraud.\n\nMoreover, personality-based theories of intellectual property often\nappeal to other moral considerations. Hegel\u2019s personality-based\njustification of intellectual property rights included an\nincentive-based component as well\u2014he asserts that protecting the\nsciences promotes them, benefiting society (Hegel 1821). Perhaps the\nbest way to protect these intuitively attractive personality-based\nclaims to intangible works is to adopt a more comprehensive system\ndesigned to promote progress and social utility.\n",
