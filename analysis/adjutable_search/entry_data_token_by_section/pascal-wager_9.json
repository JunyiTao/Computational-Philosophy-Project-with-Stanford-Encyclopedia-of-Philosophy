    "main_text": "A Fourth \u201cWager\u201d?\n6. A Fourth \u201cWager\u201d?\n\nWe have concluded our discussion of what is traditionally known as\n\u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d. But Pascal has one last twist in\nstore for us. In his \u201cEnd of this address\u201d he writes\nregarding wagering for God:\n\nNow, what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be\nfaithful, humble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful.\nCertainly you will not have those poisonous pleasures, glory and\nluxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will\nthereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you take on this\nroad, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in\nwhat you risk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered\nfor something certain and infinite, for which you have given\nnothing.\n\nThis passage makes two further striking claims regarding wagering for\nGod: you will \u201cgain in this life\u201d, and \u201cyou have\nwagered for something certain\u201d. The decision table can be\npresented as follows (with the outcomes ranked):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nWager for God\n\n\nGain all\n\n(Best) \n\n\nGain in earthly life\n\n(Second best)  \n\nWager against God\n\n\nMisery\n\n(Worst) \n\n\nEarthly life\n\n(Third best)   \n\n\nThis is again a decision under uncertainty (in our technical\nsense)\u2014it involves no considerations of probability. Indeed,\n\u201cthe wager\u201d dissolves, twice over: utilities alone\ndefinitively settle that you should wager for God, and in any case it\nis not really a gamble at all, since your gain is certain! (That is my\nunderstanding of \u201cyou have wagered for something certain\u201d;\nit is not God's existence itself that\nis\u00a0\u201ccertain\u201d.)\u00a0The worst outcome associated with\nwagering for God (gain in earthly life) is\u00a0strictly\nbetter\u00a0than the best outcome associated with wagering\nagainst God (earthly life). It follows immediately that you should\nwager for God. H\u00e1jek (2018) calls this an argument\nfrom\u00a0superduperdominance. This is a valid argument for\nwagering for God, even if we allow that God's existence might be\nimpossible.\n\nPascal has come full circle back to the first wager, and he now goes\neven beyond it. The solution to\u00a0this\u00a0decision\nproblem is trivial. The status of this \u201cwager\u201d\u2014the\nsoundness or otherwise of this argument\u2014turns on whether one's\nprospects are as this decision table portrays them. See Jordan (2006)\nand (2018, 108\u2013109) for further discusion.\n",
