    "main_text": "Giuseppe Peano\n5. Giuseppe Peano\n\nIn his 1889, Giuseppe Peano, independently of Peirce and Frege,\nintroduced a notation for universal quantification. If a and\nb are propositions with the free variables \\(x, y, \\ldots\\),\nthen \\(a \\mathbin{\\revc_{x, y,\\ldots}} b\\) symbolized: Whatever \\(x,\ny, \\ldots\\), may be, from the proposition a one deduces\nb. One hesitates to call this a notation for the universal\nquantifier, since the quantification is not severable from the sign\nfor material implication: notationally, this is a considerable step\nbackwards from Peirce. Peano moreover does not distinguish first-order\nfrom second-order quantification. The point of his essay was to\npresent the principles of arithmetic in logical symbolism, and his\nformulation of the principle of mathematical induction can be seen, by\nour lights, to be second-order: but only tacitly. This was a\ndistinction to which (again unlike Peirce) he seems to have attached\nno importance. He did, however, add a range of new symbols to\nmathematical logic which were to be influential on the work of\nWhitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica; and one of\nthe symbols was the notation \\(\\exists\\) for the existential\nquantifier. (Oddly, Peano did not introduce a parallel symbol for the\nuniversal quantifier. It seems to have been Whitehead who introduced\nthe \\((x)\\) notation in Principia, and Hilbert who introduced\nthe symbol \\(\\forall\\).)\n",
