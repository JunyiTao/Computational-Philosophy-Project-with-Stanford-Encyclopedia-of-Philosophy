As he was completing\nthe Platonic Theology, he wrote his On the Christian\nReligion, a treatise that, in its lapidary beginning, synthesized\nmuch of his life-long commitment to the centrality of religion to\nhuman experience. He begins the work\u2019s first chapter: \u201cWe do\nobserve, at times in some animals, some individual gifts of the human\nrace, with one exception: religion\u201d (Ficino 1576, 2). And he\nhad already written, in the preface to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, that God\u2019s\nwisdom had established that the \u201cdivine mysteries,\u201d which\nis to say religion, should be handled by \u201cthose who were true\nlovers of true wisdom,\u201d in short by true\n\u201cphilosophers.\u201d Humanity\u2019s uniqueness with respect to\nreligion also demanded that religion should be watched over by members\nwho adhered to its highest calling: the love of wisdom, or\nphilosophy. Ficino produced both a vernacular and a Latin version of\nthis work; the vernacular version was published in 1474, whereas the\nLatin came out in 1476, even as Ficino seems to have published two\nlater, different redactions (Kristeller 1938, 1: lxxviii).\n\n\nThe rest of that decade was filled with work that reflected Ficino\u2019s\npropensity to join philosophy and religion: in different contexts\n(letters and discussions) he spread some of the doctrines elaborated\nin his yet-to-be printed Platonic Theology. He continued work\non commentaries, and he wrote his work on the rapture of St. Paul\n(De raptu Pauli); Paul\u2019s \u201crapture\u201d referred to a\npassage in II Cor. 12:2\u20134, where Paul is said to have known a\n\u201cman\u201d (widely assumed to have been the Apostle himself)\n\u201cwho was taken up into heaven and heard the secret words\n[arcana verba] that man is not allowed to hear.\u201d This\npassage, which was resonant with themes of ecstatic, extra-mental\nascent, had been important to Augustine and Aquinas (Newman); and for\nFicino, it also proved a touchstone, given that themes of ascent were\ndear to the Platonic tradition.\n\n\nFicino\u2019s medical mission continued to play a role in these years. He\nworked on his \u201cAdvice against the Plague\u201d (Consiglio\ncontro la pestilenza) in 1478\u201379, a treatise that was\nprinted in 1481 (Katinis 2007).\n",
