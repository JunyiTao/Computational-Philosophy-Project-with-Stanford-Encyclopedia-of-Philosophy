    "main_text": "The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality || On the origin and nature of parameter dependence\n8.5 On the origin and nature of parameter dependence\n\n\nParameter dependence (PI) postulates that in the EPR/B experiment the\nprobability of the later, distant measurement outcome depends on the\nsetting of the apparatus of the nearby, earlier measurement. It may be\ntempting to assume that this dependence is due to a direct influence\nof the nearby setting on the (probability of the) distant outcome. But\na little reflection on the failure of PI in Bohm's theory, which is\nthe paradigm for parameter dependence, demonstrates that the setting\nof the nearby apparatus per se has no influence on the\ndistant measurement outcome.  Rather, it is because the setting of the\nnearby measurmenent apparatus influences the nearby measurement\noutcome and the nearby outcome influences the distant outcome that the\nsetting of the nearby apparatus can have an influence on the distant\noutcome. For, as is not difficult to see from the analysis of the\nnature of non-locality in the minimal Bohm theory (see section 5.3.1),\nthe setting of the apparatus of the nearby (earlier) measurement in\nthe EPR/B experiment influences the outcome the nearby measurement,\nand this outcome influences the guiding field of the distant particle\nand accordingly the outcome of a measurement on that particle.\n\n\nWhile the influence of the nearby setting on the nearby outcome is\nnecessary for parameter dependence, it is not sufficient for it. In\nall the current quantum theories, the probabilities of joint outcomes\nin the EPR/B experiment depend on the settings of both measurement\napparatuses: The probability that the L-outcome is l-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-outcome is r-spin \u2018up\u2019\nand the probability that the L-outcome is l-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-outcome is r-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 both depend on (l \u2212 r),\ni.e.,  the distance between the angles l and r. In\ntheories in which the sum of these joint probabilities is invariant\nwith respect to the value of (l \u2212 r),\nparameter independence obtains: for all pairs' states \u03bb,\nL-setting l, and R-settings r and r\u2032,\nL-outcome xl, and R-outcomes\nyr and yr\u2032\u2009:\n\n\n(PI) \nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl & \nyr) + \nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl &\n\u00acyr) =\nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r\u2032\u2009(xl \n& yr\u2032\u2009) +\nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r\u2032\u2009(xl \n& \u00acyr\u2032\u2009).\n \n\n\n\n\nParameter dependence is a violation of this invariance condition.\n",
