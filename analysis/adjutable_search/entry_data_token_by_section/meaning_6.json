    "main_text": "Foundational Theories of Meaning || Mentalist Theories\n3.1 Mentalist Theories\n\nAll mentalist theories of meaning have in common that they analyze one\nsort of representation\u2014linguistic representation\u2014in terms\nof another sort of representation\u2014mental representation. For\nphilosophers who are interested in explaining content, or\nrepresentation, in non-representational terms, then, mentalist\ntheories can only be a first step in the task of giving an ultimate\nexplanation of the foundations of linguistic representation. The\nsecond, and more fundamental explanation would then come at the level\nof a theory of mental content. (For an overview of theories of this\nsort, see entry on\n mental representation\n and the essays in Stich and Warfield 1994.) Indeed, the popularity of\nmentalist theories of linguistic meaning, along with the conviction\nthat content should be explicable in non-representational terms, is an\nimportant reason why so much attention has been focused on theories of\nmental representation over the last few decades.\n\nSince mentalists aim to explain the nature of meaning in terms of the\nmental states of language users, mentalist theories may be divided\naccording to which mental states they take to be relevant to the\ndetermination of meaning. The most well-worked out views on this topic\nare the Gricean view, which explains meaning in terms of the\ncommunicative intentions of language users, and the view that the\nmeanings of expressions are fixed by conventions which pair sentences\nwith certain beliefs. We will discuss these in turn, followed by a\nbrief discussion of a third alternative available to the\nmentalist.\n3.1.1 The Gricean program\n\nPaul Grice\n developed an analysis of meaning which can be thought of as the\nconjunction of two claims: (1) facts about what expressions mean are\nto be explained, or analyzed, in terms of facts about what speakers\nmean by utterances of them, and (2) facts about what speakers mean by\ntheir utterances can be explained in terms of their intentions. These\ntwo theses comprise the \u201cGricean program\u201d for reducing\nmeaning to the contents of the intentions of speakers.\n\nTo understand Grice\u2019s view of meaning, it is important first to\nbe clear on the distinction between the meaning, or content, of\nlinguistic expressions\u2014which is what semantic theories\nlike those discussed in\n \u00a72\n aim to describe\u2014and what speakers mean by utterances\nemploying those expressions. This distinction can be illustrated by\nexample. (See entry on\n pragmatics\n for more discussion.) Suppose that in response to a question about\nthe weather in the city where I live, I say \u201cWell, South Bend is\nnot exactly Hawaii\u201d. The meaning of this sentence is fairly\nclear: it expresses the (true) proposition that South Bend, Indiana is\nnot identical to Hawaii. But what I mean by uttering this\nsentence is something more than this triviality: I mean by the\nutterance that the weather in South Bend is not nearly as good as that\nin Hawaii. And this example utterance is in an important respect very\ntypical: usually the propositions which speakers mean to convey by\ntheir utterances include propositions other than the one expressed by\nthe sentence used in the context. When we ask \u201cWhat did you mean\nby that?\u201d we are usually not asking for the meaning of the\nsentence uttered.\n\nThe idea behind stage (1) of Grice\u2019s theory of meaning is that\nof these two phenomena, speaker-meaning is the more fundamental:\nsentences and other expressions mean what they do because of what\nspeakers mean by their utterances of those sentences. (For more\ndetails about how Grice thought that sentence-meaning could be\nexplained in terms of speaker-meaning, see the discussion of resultant\nprocedures in the entry on\n Paul Grice.)\n One powerful way to substantiate the claim that speaker-meaning is\nexplanatorily prior to expression-meaning would be to show that facts\nabout speaker-meaning may be given an analysis which makes no use of\nfacts about what expressions mean; and this is just what stage (2) of\nGrice\u2019s analysis, to which we now turn, aims to provide.\n\nGrice thought that speaker-meaning could be analyzed in terms of the\ncommunicative intentions of speakers\u2014in particular, their\nintentions to cause beliefs in their audience.\n\nThe simplest version of this idea would hold that meaning p by\nan utterance is just a matter of intending that one\u2019s audience\ncome to believe p. But this can\u2019t be quite right. Suppose\nI turn to you and say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot\u201d.\nI intend that you hear the words I am saying; so I intend that you\nbelieve that I have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my\nfoot\u201d. But I do not mean by my utterance that I have said,\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot\u201d. That is my\nutterance\u2014what I mean by it is the proposition that you are\nstanding on my foot, or that you should get off of my foot. I do not\nmean by my utterance that I am uttering a certain sentence.\n\nThis sort of example indicates that speaker meaning can\u2019t just\nbe a matter of intending to cause a certain belief\u2014it must be\nintending to cause a certain belief in a certain way. But what, in\naddition to intending to cause the belief, is required for meaning\nthat p? Grice\u2019s idea was that one must not only intend to\ncause the audience to form a belief, but also intend that they do so\non the basis of their recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention.\nThis condition is not met in the above example: I don\u2019t expect\nyou to believe that I have uttered a certain sentence on the basis of\nyour recognition of my intention that you do so; after all,\nyou\u2019d believe this whether or not I wanted you to. This is all\nto the good.\n\nThis Gricean analysis of speaker-meaning can be formulated as\n follows:[5]\n\n[G] a means\np by uttering x iff a intends in uttering\nx that\n  1.\nhis audience come to\nbelieve p, \n  2.\n his audience recognize\nthis intention, and \n  3.\n (1) occur on the basis\nof (2). \n\n\nHowever, even if [G] can be given a fairly plausible motivation, and\nfits many cases rather well, it is also open to some convincing\ncounterexamples. Three such types of cases are: (i) cases in which the\nspeaker means p by an utterance despite knowing that the\naudience already believes p, as in cases of reminding or\nconfession; (ii) cases in which a speaker means p by an\nutterance, such as the conclusion of an argument, which the speaker\nintends an audience to believe on the basis of evidence rather than\nrecognition of speaker intention; and (iii) cases in which there is no\nintended audience at all, as in uses of language in thought. These\ncases call into question whether there is any connection between\nspeaker-meaning and intended effects stable enough to ground an\nanalysis of the sort that Grice envisaged; it is still a matter of\nmuch controversy whether an explanation of speaker meaning descended\nfrom [G] can succeed.\n\nFor developments of the Gricean program, see\u2014in addition to the\nclassic essays in Grice (1989)\u2014Schiffer (1972), Neale (1992),\nand Davis (2002). For an extended criticism, see Schiffer (1987).\n3.1.2 Meaning, belief, and convention\n\nAn important alternative to the Gricean analysis, which shares the\nGricean\u2019s commitment to a mentalist analysis of meaning in terms\nof the contents of mental states, is the analysis of meaning in terms\nof the beliefs rather than the intentions of speakers.\n\nIt is intuitively plausible that such an analysis should be possible.\nAfter all, there clearly are regularities which connect utterances and\nthe beliefs of speakers; roughly, it seems that, for the most part,\nspeakers seriously utter a sentence which (in the context) means\np only if they also believe p. One might then, try to\nanalyze meaning directly in terms of the beliefs of language users, by\nsaying that what it is for a sentence S to express some\nproposition p is for it to be the case that, typically, members\nof the community would not utter S unless they believed\np. However, we can imagine a community in which there is some\naction which everyone would only perform were they to believe some\nproposition p, but which is such that no member of the\ncommunity knows that any other member of the community acts according\nto a rule of this sort. It is plausible that in such a community, the\naction-type in question would not express the proposition p, or\nindeed have any meaning at all.\n\nBecause of cases like this, it seems that regularities in meaning and\nbelief are not sufficient to ground an analysis of meaning. For this\nreason, many proponents of a mentalist analysis of meaning in terms of\nbelief have sought instead to analyze meaning in terms of\nconventions governing such regularities. Roughly, a\nregularity is a matter of convention when the regularity obtains\nbecause there is something akin to an agreement among a group of\npeople to keep the regularity in place. So, applied to our present\nexample, the idea would be (again roughly) that for a sentence\nS to express a proposition p in some group is for there\nto be something like an agreement in that group to maintain some sort\nof regularity between utterances of S and agents\u2019\nbelieving p. This seems to be what is lacking in the example\ndescribed in the previous paragraph.\n\nThere are different ways to make this rough idea precise (see the\nentry on\n convention).\n According to one important view, a sentence S expresses the\nproposition p if and only if the following three conditions are\nsatisfied: (1) speakers typically utter S only if they believe\np and typically come to believe p upon hearing S,\n(2) members of the community believe that (1) is true, and (3) the\nfact that members of the community believe that (1) is true, and\nbelieve that other members of the community believe that (1) is true,\ngives them a good reason to go on acting so as to make (1) true. (This\na simplified version of the theory defended in David Lewis 1975.)\n\nFor critical discussion of this sort of analysis of meaning, see Burge\n1975, Hawthorne 1990, Laurence 1996, and Schiffer 2006.\n3.1.3 Mental representation-based theories\n\nThe two sorts of mentalist theories sketched above both try to explain\nmeaning in terms of the relationship between linguistic expressions\nand propositional attitudes of users of the relevant language. But\nthis is not the only sort of theory available to a theorist who wants\nto analyze meaning in terms of broadly mental representation. A common\nview in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science is that the\npropositional attitudes of subjects are underwritten by an internal\nlanguage of thought, comprised of mental representations. (See entry\non\n the computational theory of mind.)\n One might try to explain linguistic meaning directly in terms of the\ncontents of mental representations, perhaps by thinking of language\nprocessing as pairing linguistic expressions with mental\nrepresentations; one could then think of the meaning of the relevant\nexpression for that individual as being inherited from the content of\nthe mental representation with which it is paired.\n\nWhile this view has, historically, not enjoyed as much attention as\nthe mentalist theories discussed in the preceding two subsections, it\nis a natural view for anyone who endorses the widely held thesis that\nsemantic competence is to be explained by some sort of internal\nrepresentation of the semantic facts. If we need to posit such\ninternal representations anyway, it is natural to think that the\nmeaning of an expression for an individual can be explained in terms\nof that individual's representation of its meaning. For discussion of\nthis sort of theory, see Laurence (1996).\n\nJust as proponents of Gricean and convention-based theories typically\nview their theories as only the first stage in an analysis of\nmeaning\u2014because they analyze meaning in terms of another sort of\nmental representation\u2014so proponents of mental\nrepresentation-based theories will typically seek to provide an\nindependent analysis of contents of mental representations. For an\noverview of attempts to provide the latter sort of theory, see the\nentry on\n mental representation\n and the essays in Stich and Warfield (1994).\n3.2 Non-Mentalist Theories\n\nAs noted above, not all foundational theories of meaning attempt to\nexplain meaning in terms of mental content. One might be inclined to\npursue a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning for a number of\nreasons; for example, one might be skeptical about the mentalist\ntheories on offer; one might think that mental representation should\nbe analyzed in terms of linguistic representation, rather than the\nother way around; or one might think that representation should be\nanalyzable in non-representational terms, and doubt whether there is\nany true explanation of mental representation suitable to accompany a\nmentalist reduction of meaning to mental representation.\n\nTo give a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning is to say which\naspects of the use of an expression determine\nmeaning\u2014and do so without taking that expression to simply\ninherit its content from some more fundamental bearer of content. In\nwhat follows I\u2019ll briefly discuss some of the aspects of the use\nof expressions which proponents of non-mentalist theories have taken\nto explain their meanings.\n3.2.1 Causal origin\n\nIn Naming and Necessity, Kripke suggested that the reference\nof a name could be explained in terms of the history of use of that\nname, rather than by descriptions associated with that name by its\nusers. In the standard case, Kripke thought, the right explanation of\nthe reference of a name could be divided into an explanation of the\nname\u2019s introduction as name for this or that\u2014an\nevent of \u201cbaptism\u201d\u2014and its successful\ntransmission from one speaker to another.\n\nOne approach to the theory of meaning is to extend Kripke\u2019s\nremarks in two ways: first, by suggesting that they might serve as an\naccount of meaning, as well as\n reference;[6]\n and second, by extending them to parts of speech other than names.\n(See, for discussion, Devitt 1981.) In this way, we might aim to\nexplain the meanings of expressions in terms of their causal\norigin.\n\nWhile causal theories don\u2019t take expressions to simply inherit\ntheir contents from mental states, it is plausible that they should\nstill give mental states an important role to play in explaining\nmeaning. For example, it is plausible that introducing a term involves\nintending that it stand for some object or property, and that\ntransmission of a term from one speaker to another involves the latter\nintending to use it in the same way as the former.\n\nThere are two standard problems for causal theories of this sort\n(whether they are elaborated in a mentalist or a non-mentalist way).\nThe first is the problem of extending the theory from the case of\nnames to to other sorts of vocabulary for which the theory seems less\nnatural. Examples which have seemed to many to be problematic are\nempty names and non-referring theoretical terms, logical vocabulary,\nand predicates which, because their content does not seem closely\nrelated to the properties represented in perceptual experience, are\nnot intuitively linked to any initial act of \u201cbaptism\u201d.\nThe second problem, which is sometimes called the \u201cqua\nproblem\u201d, is the problem of explaining which of the many causes\nof a term\u2019s introduction should determine its content. Suppose\nthat the term \u201cwater\u201d was introduced in the presence of a\nbody of H2O. What made it a term for this substance, rather\nthan for liquid in general, or colorless liquid, or colorless liquid\nin the region of the term's introduction? The proponent of a causal\ntheory owes some answer to this question; see for discussion Devitt\nand Sterelny (1987).\n\nFor a classic discussion of the prospects of causal theories, see\nEvans (1973). For a\nrecent theory which makes causal origin part but not all of the story,\nsee Dickie (2015).\n3.2.2 Truth-maximization and the principle of charity\n\nCausal theories aim to explain meaning in terms of the relations\nbetween expressions and the objects and properties they represent. A\nvery different sort of foundational theory of meaning which maintains\nthis emphasis on the relations between expressions and the world gives\na central role to a principle of charity which holds that\n(modulo some qualifications) the right assignment of meanings to the\nexpression of a subject\u2019s language is that assignment of\nmeanings which maximizes the truth of the subject\u2019s\nutterances.\n\nAn influential proponent of this sort of view was Donald Davidson, who\nstated the motivation for the view as follows:\n\n\nA central source of trouble is the way beliefs and meanings conspire\nto account for utterances. A speaker who holds a sentence to be true\non an occasion does so in part because of what he means, or would\nmean, by an utterance of that sentence, and in part because of what he\nbelieves. If all we have to go on is the fact of honest utterance, we\ncannot infer the belief without knowing the meaning, and have no\nchance of inferring the meaning without the belief. (Davidson 1974a:\n314; see also Davidson 1973)\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s idea was that attempts to state the facts in virtue\nof which expressions have a certain meaning for a subject face a kind\nof dilemma: if we had an independent account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content, we could ascend from\nthere to an account of what it is for a sentence to have a meaning; if\nwe had an independent account of what it is for a sentence to have a\nmeaning, we could ascend from there to an account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content; but in fact neither\nsort of independent account is available, because many assignments of\nbeliefs and meanings are consistent with the subject\u2019s\nlinguistic behavior. Davidson\u2019s solution to this dilemma is that\nwe must define belief and meaning together, in terms of an independent\nthird fact: the fact that the beliefs of an agent, and the meanings of\nher words, are whatever they must be in order to maximize the truth of\nher beliefs and utterances.\n\nBy tying meaning and belief to truth, this sort of foundational theory\nof meaning implies that it is impossible for anyone who speaks a\nmeaningful language to be radically mistaken about the nature of the\nworld; and this implies that certain levels of radical disagreement\nbetween a pair of speakers or communities will also be impossible\n(since the beliefs of each community must be, by and large, true).\nThis is a consequence of the view which Davidson embraced (see\nDavidson 1974b); but one might also reasonably think that radical\ndisagreement, as well as radical error, are possible, and hence that\nany theory, like Davidson\u2019s, which implies that they are\nimpossible must be mistaken.\n\nA different sort of worry about a theory of this sort is that the\nrequirement that we maximize the truth of the utterances of subjects\nhardly seems sufficient to determine the meanings of the expressions\nof their language. It seems plausible, offhand, that there will be\nmany different interpretations of a subject\u2019s language which\nwill be tied on the measure of truth-maximization; one way to see the\nforce of this sort of worry is to recall the point, familiar from our\ndiscussion of possible worlds semantics in\n \u00a72.1.5\n above, that a pair of sentences can be true in exactly the same\ncircumstances and yet differ in meaning. One worry is thus that a\ntheory of Davidson\u2019s sort will entail an implausible\nindeterminacy of meaning. For Davidson\u2019s fullest attempt to\nanswer this sort of worry, see Chapter 3 of Davidson (2005).\n3.2.3 Reference magnetism\n\nA different sort of theory emerges from a further objection to the\nsort of theory discussed in the previous section. This objection is\nbased on Hilary Putnam\u2019s (1980, 1981) model-theoretic argument.\nThis argument aimed to show that there are very many different\nassignments of reference to subsentential expressions of our language\nwhich make all of our utterances true. (For details on how the\nargument works, see the entry on\n Skolem\u2019s paradox,\n especially \u00a73.4.) Putnam\u2019s argument therefore leaves us\nwith a choice between two options: either we must accept that there\nare no facts of the matter about what any of our expressions refer to,\nor we must deny that is determined solely by a principle of\ntruth-maximization.\n\nMost philosophers take the second option. Doing so, however,\ndoesn\u2019t mean that something like the principle of charity\ncan\u2019t still be part of our foundational theory of meaning.\n\nDavid Lewis (1983, 1984) gave a version of this kind of response,\nwhich he credits to Merrill (1980), and which has since been quite\ninfluential. His idea was that the assignment of contents to\nexpressions of our language is fixed, not just by the constraint that\nthe right interpretation will maximize the truth of our utterances,\nbut by picking the interpretation which does best at jointly\nsatisfying the constraints of truth-maximization and the constraint\nthat the referents of our terms should, as much as possible, be\n\u201cthe ones that respect the objective joints in nature\u201d\n(1984: 227).\n\nSuch entities are often said to be more \u201celigible\u201d to be\nthe referents of expressions than others. An approach to the\nfoundations of meaning based on the twin principles of charity +\neligibility has some claim to being the most widely held view today.\nSee Sider (2011) for an influential extension of the Lewisian\nstrategy.\n\nLewis\u2019 solution to Putnam\u2019s problem comes with a\nnon-trivial metaphysical price tag: recognition of an objective graded\ndistinction between more and less natural properties. Some have found\nthe price too much to pay, and have sought other approaches to the\nfoundational theory of meaning. But even if we recognize in our\nmetaphysics a distinction between properties which are\n\u201cjoint-carving\u201d and those which are not, we might still\ndoubt whether this distinction can remedy the sorts of indeterminacy\nproblems which plague foundational theories based solely on the\nprinciple of charity. For doubts along these lines, see Hawthorne\n(2007).\n3.2.4 Regularities in use\n\nA different way to develop a non-mentalist foundational theory of\nmeaning focuses less on relations between subsentential expressions or\nsentences and bits of non-linguistic reality and more on the\nregularities which govern our use of language. Views of this sort have\nbeen defended by a number of authors; this section focuses on the\nversion of the view developed in Horwich (1998, 2005).\n\nHorwich\u2019s core idea is that our acceptance of sentences is\ngoverned by certain laws, and, in the case of non-ambiguous\nexpressions, there is a single \u201cacceptance regularity\u201d\nwhich explains all of our uses of the expression. The type of\nacceptance regularity which is relevant will vary depending on the\nsort of expression whose meaning is being explained. For example, our\nuse of a perceptual term like \u201cred\u201d might be best\nexplained by the following acceptance regularity:\n\n\nThe disposition to accept \u201cthat is red\u201d in response to the\nsort of visual experience normally provoked by a red surface.\n\n\nwhereas, in the case of a logical term like \u201cand\u201d, the\nacceptance regularity will involve dispositions to accept inferences\ninvolving pairs of sentences rather than dispositions to respond to\nparticular sorts of experiences:\n\n\nThe disposition to accept the two-way argument schema \u201cp,\nq // p and q\u201d.\n\n\nAs these examples illustrate, it is plausible that a strength of a\nview like Horwich\u2019s is its ability to handle expressions of\ndifferent categories.\n\nLike its competitors, Horwich\u2019s theory is also open to some\nobjections. One might worry that his use of the sentential attitude of\nacceptance entails a lapse into mentalism, if acceptance either just\nis, or is analyzed in terms of, beliefs. There is also a\nworry\u2014which affects other \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cconceptual\nrole\u201d or \u201cfunctional role\u201d theories of\nmeaning\u2014that Horwich\u2019s account implies the existence of\ndifferences in meaning which do not exist; it seems, for example, that\ntwo people\u2019s use of some term might be explained by distinct\nbasic acceptance regularities without their meaning different things\nby that term. Schiffer (2000) discusses the example of\n\u201cdog\u201d, and the differences between the basic acceptance\nregularities which govern the use of the term for the blind, the\nbiologically unsophisticated, and people acquainted only with certain\nsorts of\n dogs.[7]\n3.2.5 Social norms\n\nThis last concern about Horwich\u2019s theory stems from the fact\nthat the theory is, at its core, an individualist theory: it explains\nthe meaning of an expression for an individual in terms of properties\nof that individual\u2019s use of the term. A quite different sort of\nuse theory of meaning turns from the laws which explain an\nindividual\u2019s use of a word to the norms which, in a society,\ngovern the use of the relevant terms. Like the other views discussed\nhere, the view that meaning is a product of social norms of this sort\nhas a long history; it is particularly associated with the work of the\nlater Wittgenstein and his philosophical descendants. (See especially\nWittgenstein 1953.)\n\nAn important defender of this sort of view is Robert Brandom. On\nBrandom\u2019s view, a sentence\u2019s meaning is due to the\nconditions, in a given society, under which it is correct or\nappropriate to perform various speech acts involving the sentence. To\ndevelop a theory of this sort, one must do two things. First, one must\nshow how the meanings of expressions can be explained in terms of\nthese normative statuses\u2014in Brandom\u2019s (slightly\nnonstandard) terms, one must show how semantics can be explained in\nterms of pragmatics. Second, one must explain how these normative\nstatuses can be instituted by social practices.\n\nFor details, see Brandom (1994), in which the view is developed at\ngreat length; for a critical discussion of Brandom\u2019s attempt to\ncarry out the second task above, see Rosen (1997). For discussion of\nthe role (or lack thereof) of normativity in a foundational theory of\nmeaning, see Hattiangadi (2007), Gluer and Wilkforss (2009), and the\nentry on\n meaning normativity.",
