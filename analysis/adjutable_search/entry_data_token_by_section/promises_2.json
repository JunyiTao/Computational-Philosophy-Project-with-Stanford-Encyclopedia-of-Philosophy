Aquinas used Aristotelian assumptions and techniques to expand\nand detail the theory, deriving the duty to keep a promise from the\nintentions of the promisor and the underpinning virtues (see Gordley\n1991: 10ff).\n\nAquinas discusses promises indirectly, in his treatment of vows, which\nhe takes are promises made to God. His adaptation of Aristotelian\nvirtue theory to the precepts of the natural law made for some\nimportant changes in the theory\u2014principally a shift in focus to\nthe will of the promisor as the agent of obligation. For Aquinas, a\npromise is essentially the agent\u00a0\u201cbinding\u201d himself\n(i.e., generating an obligation) by act of will:\n\n\nA vow denotes a binding to do or omit some particular thing. Now one\nman binds himself to another by means of a promise, which is an act of\nthe reason to which faculty it belongs to direct. For just as a man by\ncommanding or praying, directs, in a fashion, what others are to do\nfor him, so by promising he directs what he himself is to do for\nanother. [\u2026] Now a promise is the outcome from a purpose of\ndoing something: and a purpose presupposes deliberation, since it is\nthe act of a deliberate will. Accordingly three things are essential\nto a vow: the first is deliberation; the second is a purpose of the\nwill; and the third is a promise, wherein is completed the nature of a\nvow. Sometimes, however, two other things are added as a sort of\nconfirmation of the vow, namely, pronouncement by word of mouth,\naccording to Psalm 65:13, \u201cI will pay Thee my vows which my lips\nhave uttered\u201d; and the witnessing of others. Hence the Master\nsays (Sent. iv, D, 38) that a vow is \u201cthe witnessing of a\nspontaneous promise and ought to be made to God and about things\nrelating to God\u201d: although the \u201cwitnessing\u201d may\nstrictly refer to the inward protestation. (Summa, II-II,\nq.88)\n\n\nStill later on, important early modern commentators on promising in\nthe Natural Law tradition such as Locke (1689, Two Treatises On\nGovernment, II-II:14), Reid (1788, Essay on the Active Powers\nof Man, 2), Grotius (1625, De iure naturae, ii. xi.),\nPufendorf (1672, De iure naturae et gentium, iii. v. 9),\nStair (1681/93, Institutions of the Laws of Scotland, I.\nX.1), and others developed the doctrine in new directions.\n\nThis natural law tradition waned in popularity among philosophers\nduring the modern period, with influential early theorists like Hobbes\nand Hume adopting conventionalist sorts of views. This is of a piece\nwith the turn to more naturalistic views in many different areas of\nwestern philosophy, but the tradition never disappeared. Through the\nworks of later natural lawyers in Spain and elsewhere, (Suarez,\nMolina), the tradition greatly influenced the development of European\nprivate law doctrine\u2014the doctrine underlying things like\ncontract and tort law. See the section below on the\n relationship between promissory theory and contract law\n for more. For an excellent overview of these issues, see chapter 1 of\nJames Gordley\u2019s The Philosophical Origins of Modern Contract\nDoctrine (1991).\n",
