    "main_text": "History of the Philosophical Debate on Substance || Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz\n2.4 Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz\n\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the\nrationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the\nempiricists. The rationalists\u2019 substances are not, however, the\nindividual objects of everyday life.\n\nDescartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body,\nwhich is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined\nby thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to\nconsciousness. Descartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his\ncontemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist. He did\nnot believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which\nthere is just one material substance, numerically as well as\nspecifically. For Descartes, therefore, material substance falls more\nnaturally into the stuff category, rather than into the\nthing category. The situation is different for mental\nsubstance. The cogito shows that Descartes definitely\nbelieves that each person is a different individual mental\nsubstance.\n\nDescartes, like the atomists, believed that matter operates in an\nentirely mechanical way. There is, therefore, no causal role for\nsubstantial form to play and, hence, no need for such forms. His two\nsubstances are each defined in terms of one property (extension for\nmatter and thought for mind), hence there is no problem about the\nrelation between substance and the properties in terms of which it is\ndefined. As he does not have substances as individuals made of kinds\nof stuff, there is no conflict between individuals and stuffs.\n\nFor Spinoza, there is only one substance, the existence of which is\ndemonstrated by a version of the ontological argument, that is thought\nof as being both God and Nature. It is an unending controversy whether\nSpinoza was a pantheist, or an atheist who called nature\n\u2018God\u2019 because it was the one true substance and existed\nnecessarily. Everything else is a mode of this one substance. The view\nis analogous to a claim that the universe is space-time as a whole,\nwith matter as distortions in it. If this were true, material objects\nwould be modes of space-time. The analogy would be more exact if one\nalso thought of the laws of nature as equivalent to the divine\nintellect immanent in nature. Spinoza\u2019s view represents the\nextreme end of stressing the status of substance as the fundamental\nexistent conceived of as wholly necessary and self-subsistent: that\nis, criteria (i) and (ii) in the original list come to take on maximum\nweight. Nothing but the universe as a whole meets this criterion\nfully.\n\nLeibniz was not satisfied by this conception of divine substance, at\nleast in part because it confines God to what actually exists. For\nLeibniz, God contains within himself all possibilities, not just the\nactual world: this latter is just that maximal set of possibilities\nthat he has best reason to actualise. Leibniz acknowledges created\nsubstances, though they are very intimately dependent on God. In the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics (Section 14), he says:\n\nit is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them\nand indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just\nas we produce our thoughts. (1998: 66)\n\n\nThe analogy with thought hardly emphasises the independence of\nsubstance! Nevertheless, created substances do constitute the created\nworld, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance.\nThey are also the subjects of predication, so they meet criterion\n(iii). Leibniz\u2019s substances, however, are the bearers of change\n(criterion (iv)) in a very different way from Aristotle\u2019s\nindividual substances. An Aristotelian individual possesses some\nproperties essentially and some accidentally. The accidental\nproperties of an object are ones that can be gained and lost over\ntime, and which it might never have possessed at all: its essential\nproperties are the only ones it had to possess and which it possesses\nthroughout its existence. The situation is different for\nLeibniz\u2019s monads\u2014which is the name he gives to\nindividual substances, created or uncreated (so God is a monad).\nWhereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to\npossess and those that it possesses throughout its existence\ncoincide, they do not do so for Leibniz. That is, for Leibniz, even\nthe properties that an object possesses only for a part of its\nexistence are essential to it. Every monad bears each of its\nproperties as part of its nature, so if it were to have been different\nin any respect, it would have been a different entity.\n\nFurthermore, there is a sense in which all monads are exactly similar\nto each other, for they all reflect the whole world. They each do so,\nhowever, from a different perspective.\n\nFor God, so to speak, turns on all sides and considers in all ways the\ngeneral system of phenomena which he has found it good to\nproduce\u2026And he considers all the faces of the world in all\npossible ways\u2026the result of each view of the universe, as\nlooked at from a certain position, is\u2026a substance which\nexpresses the universe in conformity with that view. (1998: 66)\n\n\nSo each monad reflects the whole system, but with its own perspective\nemphasised. If a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all\nthe features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to\nits own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in\naccordance with temporal and spatial distance. Because there is a\ncontinuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of\nthese substances. Nevertheless, there is internal change in the\nmonads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with\ntime and with action. Indeed, the passage of time just is the change\nin which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.\n\nIt is not possible to investigate here Leibniz\u2019s reasons for\nthese apparently very strange views. Our present concern is with\nwhether, and in what sense, Leibniz\u2019s substances are subjects of\nchange. One can say that, in so far as, at all times, they reflect the\nwhole of reality, then they do not change. But in so far as they\nreflect some parts of that reality more vividly than others, depending\non their position in space and time, they can be said to change.\n",
