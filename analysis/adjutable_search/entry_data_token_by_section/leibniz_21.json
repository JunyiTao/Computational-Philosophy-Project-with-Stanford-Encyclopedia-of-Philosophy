It\nwas his first mature publication and one to which he often referred\nin the course of his philosophical career. In it, Leibniz sets out a series of\ndistinctions for human knowledge or cognition (cognitio):\nknowledge is either obscure or clear; clear knowledge is either\nconfused or distinct; distinct knowledge is either inadequate or\nadequate; and adequate knowledge is either symbolic or intuitive. Now,\naccording to Leibniz, clear knowledge means being able to recognize\nsomething that is represented to us, for example, a rose; and knowledge\nis both clear and distinct when one can enumerate marks sufficient to\ndistinguish a rose from other things. When one can give such an\nenumeration, one possesses a distinct notion or concept and is thus able to give a\nnominal definition of the thing. Further, if all the marks\nthat form part of a distinct notion are themselves distinctly known,\nthen the cognition is adequate. And, finally, if a notion is complex\nand we are able to consider all its component notions simultaneously,\nthen our knowledge of it is intuitive. Ultimately, Leibniz holds that\nhuman beings have intuitive knowledge only of primary notions and\npropositions, whereas God, of course, has intuitive knowledge of all\nthings.\n\n\nLeibniz believes his distinctions also serve to show the difference\nbetween true and false ideas. \u201cAn idea is true,\u201d he writes,\n\u201cwhen its notion is possible and false when it includes a\ncontradiction\u201d (A VI iv 589/AG 26). Now, possibility can be\nestablished a priori and a posteriori. On the one\nhand, we can know a priori that something is possible if we\ncan resolve it into its component notions which are themselves possible\nand if we know that there is no incompatibility among those component\nnotions. On the other hand, we know a posteriori that\nsomething is possible merely through experience, for the actual\nexistence of a thing is proof of its possibility.\n",
