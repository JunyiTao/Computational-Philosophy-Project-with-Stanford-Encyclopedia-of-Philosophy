    "main_text": "Other Types of Protest || Revolutionary Action\n2.7 Revolutionary Action\n\nWhile a civil disobedient does not necessarily oppose the regime in\nwhich she acts, the revolutionary agent is deeply opposed to that\nregime (or a core aspect of that regime). Revolutionary agents may not\nseek to persuade others of the merits of their position \u2013\ncommunication is usually not their primary aim, although they convey\nthe urgency of a regime change. When revolution is called for, such as\nunder colonial occupation, there is no need to justify constrained\nacts of protest like civil disobedience. Indeed, more forceful\nresistance can be justified as we pass into the realm of just war\ntheory (Buchanan 2013; Finlay 2015). This is not to say that all\nviolent tactics, including terror, are permissible, since the use of\nviolence must not only pursue a just cause but also accord with\nproportionality and necessity (i.e., be undertaken in last resort and\nwith a reasonable chance of success). As will be discussed in the next\nsection, revolutionary activists and thinkers like Frantz Fanon (2004,\nch. 1) and Gandhi disagreed about the effectiveness of violence in\nemancipatory struggles, but not about its justifiability, as Karuna\nMantena (2018, 83\u20134) has shown.\n",
