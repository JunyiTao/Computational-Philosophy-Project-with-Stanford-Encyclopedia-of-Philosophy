    "main_text": "Historical Background || Precursors of Bradley\u2019s Regress\n1.1 Precursors of Bradley\u2019s Regress\n\nThe most notable ancient regress argument that is associated with\nBradley\u2019s is found in Plato\u2019s Parmenides 132a-b.\nTherein Plato presents an argument that has come to be knows as the\nThird Man Argument (TMA), which challenges an explanation of\nsimilarity between distinct particulars that appeals to forms.\nFollowing Vlastos (1954), the regress can be reconstructed as\nexhibiting the following structure:\n\na, b and c are all large because there is a\nForm of largeness L that they all participate in. \na, b, c and L are all large because\nthere is a Form of largeness L1 that they all\nparticipate in.\n a, b, c, L and L1\nare all large because all of them participate in a Form of largeness\nL2, and so on ad infinitum.\n\n\n\nIt is commonly assumed that at least three theses underlie this\nargument. The first one is \u201cthe one over many\u201d which\nstates that many things having L in common must be explained by\nthe existence of the form L that all of them participate in.\nThe second premise is implicit and it has been called the premise of\n\u201cnon-self explanation\u201d; it simply assumes, that in\nexplaining what a, b, c and L have in common one\ncannot appeal to the L itself, but needs to appeal to a\ndifferent form of largeness,\nL1. The third premise which is implied\nin this argument is \u201cthe self-partaking\u201d premise; it\nassumes that the form L is itself L, i.e., that the form\nof largeness is itself large.\n\nIt has been debated at great length amongst the Plato scholars whether\nthe Third Man Argument is to be understood as a metaphysical or as an\nepistemic argument, an argument about the postulated entities or an\nargument about what is involved in our knowledge of them. (For an\nentry point on literature concerning the Third Man Argument, as well\nas the dialogue more broadly see SEP\u2019s entry Plato\u2019s\nParmenides). Similarly, there has been much disagreement about\nwhich of the theses that underlie the TMA Plato was willing\nto give up in order to avoid the regress. To a modern reader the\n\u201cself-partaking\u201d premise seems like an obvious candidate,\nsince it is quite odd to think that the form of largeness is itself\nlarge, the form of smallness itself small, etc.\n\nPlato\u2019s TMA featured prominently in Aristotle\u2019s\nPeri Ideon, and was later picked up and discussed by medieval\nphilosophers. For instance, Boethius in his Second Commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge discusses a peculiar infinite regress\nthat could be seen to echo TMA, though it is described as an\ninfinite series of genus ascriptions. (See Spade (1994: 22) for an\nEnglish translation of the text).\n\nHenninger (1989) has individuated arguments by certain orthodox Muslim\ntheologians, the Mutakallimun, that seem to resemble closely\nBradley\u2019s regress. Apparently they believed relations to be\npurely subjective, and argued that positing relations as\nmind-independent entities would lead to an infinite regress. According\nto Henninger (1989: 110), a version of this argument can also be found\nin Harclay, Ockham, and Aureoli.\n\nPerhaps the closest precursor of Bradley\u2019s regress arguments is\nto be found in Leibniz. Mugnai (2010) has drawn attention to and\ntranslated the following passage from a text dated \u201cDecember\n1676\u201d written during Leibniz\u2019s stay in Paris:\n\nSuppose, for example, that there is a relation between a and\nb, and call it c; then, consider a new relation between\na and c: call it d, and so forth to the infinite.\nIt seems that we do not have to say that all these relations are a\nkind of true and real ideas. Perhaps they are only mere intelligible\nthings, which may be produced, i.e., that are or will be produced.\n(Mugnai 2010: 1)\n\nAs we will see shortly, this passage very closely resembles the first\nof the three regresses discussed by Bradley (1893).\n",
