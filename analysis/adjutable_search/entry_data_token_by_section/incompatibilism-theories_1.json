    "main_text": "Noncausal Theories || Control\n1.1 Control\n\nThe first objection to noncausal theories of free will concerns\ncontrol. Performing an action\u2014even acting unfreely\u2014is\noften thought to involve active control over what one does, and acting\nfreely is thought to involve an especially valuable variety of such\ncontrol. An account of free will ought to say what this latter variety\nof control is or in what its exercise consists. A common objection is\nthat noncausal accounts fail to do that.\n\nAccounts of active control often appeal to causation. Exercising such\ncontrol when one acts, it is said, consists in causing some event (the\naction, or an event internal to that action). It is often further held\nthat causation by an agent consists entirely in causation by mental\nevents or states of certain kinds, such as the agent\u2019s desiring,\nbelieving, or intending something in particular. Of course, noncausal\ntheories reject any such view, but what alternative have they to offer\nus?\n\nOn Ginet\u2019s view, each basic action is characterized by an actish\nphenomenal quality, its seeming to the agent as if she is directly\nmaking happen the event that is her basic action. Ginet stresses the\n\u201cas if\u201d nature of this appearance; it does not, he says,\nliterally represent to the agent that she is causing the event in\nquestion. And in fact, he holds, it cannot be true that we really are\nagent-causes of what we do, and it need not be the case that any\nevents involving us cause our actions.\n\nMight the actish feel of some occurrence itself constitute that\nevent\u2019s activeness, the agent\u2019s exercise of active\ncontrol? Can an event\u2019s seeming to oneself to be one\u2019s\nperforming an action suffice for its being so? This seems doubtful. As\nGinet (1990: 9) allows, an event with the indicated intrinsic quality\nmight be brought about by direct stimulation of someone\u2019s brain,\nin the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that\nperson. An occurrence produced in this way and in these circumstances\nwould hardly seem to be an exercise of the subject\u2019s agency.\n\nMcCann (1998: 180) holds that an agent\u2019s exercise of active\ncontrol has two aspects: any basic action is a spontaneous, creative\nundertaking on the part of the agent, and it is intrinsically\nintentional. The intentionality of a basic action is said not to\nrequire any internal causal structure or external causal relation, yet\nit may be doubted that something\u2019s being done intentionally can\nbe altogether divorced in this way from causation. Further, supposing\nthat such intrinsic intentionality is possible, it would seem that\nhere too an event with this feature could be brought about by direct\nstimulation of someone\u2019s brain, in the absence of any relevant\ndesire or prior intention on the part of that person. But, again, such\nan occurrence, even if intrinsically something the agent means to be\nan exercise of her agency, hardly seems to be that.\n\nThe other aspect of the control that McCann says is exercised in basic\naction\u2014the spontaneity or activeness of such an\noccurrence\u2014thus appears to be the crucial one. This aspect, too,\nMcCann holds, is intrinsic to basic actions, and he maintains that\n\u201cit has a certain sui generis character that renders it\nincapable of being reduced to anything else\u201d (1998: 185). Other\nproponents of noncausal theories of action (e.g., Pink 2004: ch. 8;\nPalmer forthcoming) likewise take the exercise of active control to be\nan ontologically fundamental or irreducible thing. Whether it is\nremains controversial.\n",
