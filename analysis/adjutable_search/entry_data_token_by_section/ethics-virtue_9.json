    "main_text": "Objections to virtue ethics\n4. Future Directions\n\nOver the past thirty-five years most of those contributing to the\nrevival of virtue ethics have worked within a neo-Aristotelian,\neudaimonist framework. However, as noted in section 2, other forms of\nvirtue ethics have begun to emerge. Theorists have begun to turn to\nphilosophers like Hutcheson, Hume, Nietzsche, Martineau, and Heidegger\nfor resources they might use to develop alternatives (see Russell\n2006; Swanton 2013 and 2015; Taylor 2015; and Harcourt 2015). Others\nhave turned their attention eastward, exploring Confucian, Buddhist,\nand Hindu traditions (Yu 2007; Slingerland 2011; Finnigan and Tanaka\n2011; McRae 2012; Angle and Slote 2013; Davis 2014; Flanagan 2015;\nPerrett and Pettigrove 2015; and Sim 2015). These explorations promise\nto open up new avenues for the development of virtue ethics.\n\nAlthough virtue ethics has grown remarkably in the last thirty-five\nyears, it is still very much in the minority, particularly in the area\nof applied ethics. Many editors of big textbook collections on\n\u201cmoral problems\u201d or \u201capplied ethics\u201d now try\nto include articles representative of each of the three normative\napproaches but are often unable to find a virtue ethics article\naddressing a particular issue. This is sometimes, no doubt, because\n\u201cthe\u201d issue has been set up as a\ndeontologicial/utilitarian debate, but it is often simply because no\nvirtue ethicist has yet written on the topic. However, the last decade\nhas seen an increase in the amount of attention applied virtue ethics\nhas received (Walker and Ivanhoe 2007; Hartman 2013; Austin 2014; Van\nHooft 2014; and Annas 2015). This area can certainly be expected to\ngrow in the future, and it looks as though applying virtue ethics in\nthe field of environmental ethics may prove particularly fruitful\n(Sandler 2007; Hursthouse 2007, 2011; Zwolinski and Schmidtz 2013;\nCafaro 2015).\n\nWhether virtue ethics can be expected to grow into \u201cvirtue\npolitics\u201d\u2014i.e. to extend from moral philosophy into\npolitical philosophy\u2014is not so clear. Gisela Striker (2006) has\nargued that Aristotle\u2019s ethics cannot be understood adequately\nwithout attending to its place in his politics. That suggests that at\nleast those virtue ethicists who take their inspiration from Aristotle\nshould have resources to offer for the development of virtue politics.\nBut, while Plato and Aristotle can be great inspirations as far as\nvirtue ethics is concerned, neither, on the face of it, are attractive\nsources of insight where politics is concerned. However, recent work\nsuggests that Aristotelian ideas can, after all, generate a\nsatisfyingly liberal political philosophy (Nussbaum 2006; LeBar\n2013a). Moreover, as noted above, virtue ethics does not have to be\nneo-Aristotelian. It may be that the virtue ethics of Hutcheson and\nHume can be naturally extended into a modern political philosophy\n(Hursthouse 1990\u201391; Slote 1993).\n\nFollowing Plato and Aristotle, modern virtue ethics has always\nemphasised the importance of moral education, not as the inculcation\nof rules but as the training of character. There is now a growing\nmovement towards virtues education, amongst both academics (Carr 1999;\nAthanassoulis 2014; Curren 2015) and teachers in the classroom. One\nexciting thing about research in this area is its engagement with\nother academic disciplines, including psychology, educational theory,\nand theology (see Cline 2015; and Snow 2015).\n\nFinally, one of the more productive developments of virtue ethics has\ncome through the study of particular virtues and vices. There are now\na number of careful studies of the cardinal virtues and capital vices\n(Pieper 1966; Taylor 2006; Curzer 2012; Timpe and Boyd 2014). Others\nhave explored less widely discussed virtues or vices, such as\ncivility, decency, truthfulness, ambition, and meekness (Calhoun 2000;\nKekes 2002; Williams 2002; and Pettigrove 2007 and 2012). One of the\nquestions these studies raise is \u201cHow many virtues are\nthere?\u201d A second is, \u201cHow are these virtues related to one\nanother?\u201d Some virtue ethicists have been happy to work on the\nassumption that there is no principled reason for limiting the number\nof virtues and plenty of reason for positing a plurality of them\n(Swanton 2003; Battaly 2015). Others have been concerned that such an\nopen-handed approach to the virtues will make it difficult for virtue\nethicists to come up with an adequate account of right action or deal\nwith the conflict problem discussed above. Dan Russell has proposed\ncardinality and a version of the unity thesis as a solution to what he\ncalls \u201cthe enumeration problem\u201d (the problem of too many\nvirtues). The apparent proliferation of virtues can be significantly\nreduced if we group virtues together with some being cardinal and\nothers subordinate extensions of those cardinal virtues. Possible\nconflicts between the remaining virtues can then be managed if they\nare tied together in some way as part of a unified whole (Russell\n2009). This highlights two important avenues for future research, one\nof which explores individual virtues and the other of which analyses\nhow they might be related to one another.\n",
