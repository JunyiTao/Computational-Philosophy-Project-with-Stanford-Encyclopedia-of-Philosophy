Basic Concepts\n\nOn a standard characterization, Earth\u2019s climate system\nis the complex, interactive system consisting of the atmosphere,\nhydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and biosphere (IPCC-glossary:\n1451). Some definitions appear to be narrower, limiting the scope of\nthe climate system to those aspects of the atmosphere, hydrosphere,\netc. that jointly determine the values of paradigmatic climate\nvariables, such as average surface temperature and rainfall, in\nresponse to external influences (see, e.g., American Meteorological\nSociety 2017a). In either case, it would seem that some human\nactivities, including those that release greenhouse gases to the\natmosphere and those that change the land surface, are part of the\nclimate system. In practice, however, climate scientists often\nclassify such human activities as external influences, along with\nvolcanic eruptions (which eject reflective aerosols and other material\ninto the atmosphere) and solar output (which is the primary source of\nenergy for the system) (see IPCC-glossary: 1454). Classifying human\nactivities as external to the climate system seems to be a pragmatic\nchoice\u2014it is easier, and a reasonable first approximation, to\nrepresent anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions as exogenous\nvariables in climate models\u2014though it may also reflect a deeper\nambivalence about whether humans are part of nature. \n\nA climate is a property of a climate system, but there are\ndifferent views on what sort of property it is. According to what might be\ncalled actualist views, a climate is defined by actual\nconditions in the climate system. Narrower actualist definitions,\nwhich have their roots in climatology (see\n Section 1),\n reference weather conditions only. For example, the climate of a\nregion is often defined as its average weather conditions, or the\nstatistical distribution of those conditions, when long time periods\nare considered (Houghton 2015: 2; IPCC-glossary: 1450). The standard\nperiod of analysis, set by the World Meteorological Organization, is\n30 years, defining a \u201cclimate normal\u201d for a region. Given\nrecent rates of change in climate system conditions, however, some\nclimate scientists suggest that climate normals should now be defined\nover much shorter periods (Arguez & Vose 2011). Broader actualist\ndefinitions of climate reference conditions throughout the climate\nsystem. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for\nexample, gives a broader definition of climate as \u201cthe state,\nincluding a statistical description, of the climate system\u201d\n(IPCC-glossary: 1450). These broader definitions emerged in the second\nhalf of the twentieth century in connection with increased efforts to\nunderstand, with the help of physical theory, how climates in the\nnarrower sense are maintained and changed via atmospheric, oceanic and\nother processes. These efforts in effect marked the emergence of\nclimate science itself (see\n Section 1).\n\nA number of other definitions of \u201cclimate\u201d are what Werndl\n(2016) calls model-immanent: they reference conditions\nindicated by a model of the climate system, rather than actual\nconditions. For example, taking a dynamical systems perspective,\nclimate is often identified with an attractor of the climate system,\nthat is, with the conditions represented by an attractor of a\n(perfect) mathematical model of the climate system (Palmer 1999; Smith\n2002). Roughly speaking, an attractor is a set of points to which the\nvalues of variables in a dynamical model tend to evolve from a wide\nrange of starting values. Actual conditions in the climate system over\na finite period are then understood to be a single realization from\nthe set of possibilities represented by the attractor. A practical\ndrawback of this way of thinking about climate is that the\ndistribution of conditions in a given finite time period need not\nresemble those represented by an (infinite-time) attractor (Smith\n2002; Werndl 2016). More fundamentally, standard (autonomous)\ndynamical systems theory does not apply to models of the climate\nsystem in which external factors like solar output and greenhouse gas\nconcentrations are changing significantly with time, as they are for\nthe real climate system; how to apply the resources of non-autonomous\ndynamical systems theory to the climate system is a current area of\nresearch (e.g., Chekroun et al. 2011; Dr\u1f79tos et al. 2015).\n\nWerndl (2016) provides a critical, philosophical examination of\nseveral definitions of climate and proposes a novel, model-immanent\ndefinition on which a climate is a distribution of values of climate\nvariables over a suitably-long but finite time period, under a regime\nof external conditions and starting from a particular initial\nstate. Roughly speaking, a regime is a pattern of variation in\nexternal conditions that has an approximately constant mean value over\ndifferent sub-periods of a chosen time period. This definition is\nmodel-immanent because it refers to the distribution of conditions\nthat would obtain (i.e., the conditions that a perfect model of the\nclimate system would indicate) if the climate system were subjected to\na regime for a suitably-long time period; this distribution defines\nthe climate of periods in which that regime actually obtains, even if\nthose periods are relatively short. Werndl\u2019s definition avoids\nmany of the problems that she finds with other definitions, but still\nsome questions remain, including how to employ the regime concept when\nexternal conditions are changing rapidly.\n\nDefinitions of climate change are closely related to\ndefinitions of climate. For instance, scientists subscribing to the\nclimate-as-attractor view might characterize climate change as the\ndifference between two attractors, one associated with a set of\nexternal conditions obtaining at an earlier time and one associated\nwith a different set obtaining at a later time. By contrast, a\ndefinition of climate change associated with a narrower, actualist\nview is: \n\n\nany systematic change in the long-term statistics of climate elements\n(such as temperature, pressure, or winds) sustained over several\ndecades or longer. (American Meteorological Society 2017b) \n\n\nThe latter definition, unlike the former, allows that climate change\nmight occur even in the absence of any changes in external conditions,\nas a result of natural processes internal to the climate system (e.g.,\nslowly-evolving ocean circulations). That is, the latter definition\nallows that climate change can be a manifestation of internal\nvariability in the climate system.\n\nThe notion of internal variability, and various other concepts in\nclimate science, also raise interesting questions and problems, both\nconceptual and empirical (Katzav and Parker forthcoming). Thus far, however, the foundations of\nclimate science have remained largely unexplored by philosophers.\n",
