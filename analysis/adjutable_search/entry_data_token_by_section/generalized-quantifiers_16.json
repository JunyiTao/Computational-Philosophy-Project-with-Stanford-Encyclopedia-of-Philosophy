GQ Theory and Linguistics\n\nThe advent of generalized quantifiers had a huge impact on linguistic\nsemantics via Montague\u2019s work in the late 60s, reinforced by the\napplication of model-theoretic methods in the early 80s by Barwise and\nCooper, Keenan and Stavi, and others (see note\n 21).\n In almost all examples in these works, the natural language was\nEnglish. Linguists have since applied and tested the tools and methods\nof \u201cGQ theory\u201d on other languages. The collection Bach\net al. (1995) has, among many other\nthings, seven case studies of quantification in other languages. It\nalso emphasizes the distinction between D-quantification and\nA-quantification. In D-quantification, which most of our\nexamples so far exhibit, the quantifier expression is (usually) a\ndeterminer which applies to a noun. A-quantification is performed by\nother means\u2014A stands for adverbs, auxiliaries, affixes, and\nargument-structure adjusters. Many languages prefer A-quantification,\nsome exclusively. English has both types; recall the adverbs of\nquantification in\n (38).[36]\n\nMore recently, the volumes Keenan and Paperno\n(2012) and Paperno and Keenan\n(2017) have a separate chapter answering a fixed set of\nquestions about expressing quantification for each of 34 different\nlanguages (different also from those mentioned above), in order to\nmake an extensive inventory of their expressive\n resources.[37]\n The approach is semantic: the questions are of the form \u201cCan\none express X in your language, and if so in what ways?\u201d, which\nallows precise questions about conservativity, monotonicity, polarity\nitems, monadic vs.\u00a0polyadic quantification, etc.\u00a0to be put\nto each language. The summary in the last chapter shows that many of\nthe generalizations that hold for English, concerning the existence of\nexpressions denoting certain quantifiers and the properties of those,\nhold in all or most of the other languages studied as well (Keenan and\nPaperno list 25 such generalizations).\n\nOn the other hand, beginning in the 1990s some linguists have argued\nthat GQ theory is unable to account for a range of important semantic\nphenomena\u2014in English and other languages\u2014related to\nquantification. Szabolcsi (2010) gives a\ndetailed account of these developments. One issue is that GQ theory\nappears to have nothing to say about the compositional meaning of\ncomplex determiners. For example, how is the meaning of more\nthan five derived from the meanings of\nits parts? Or consider most, which is\noften treated as a simple determiner, even though its meaning must\nsomehow come from being a superlative of more.\n\nAnother problematic phenomenon is scope. While GQ theory in\nprinciple seems to allow all theoretically possible scopings of nested\nquantifier expressions, natural languages have restrictions regulating\nwhich of these are actually allowed. Indeed, scope is a major topic in\nlinguistic syntax and semantics, and a complex one. The problem is\nalso methodological: how to determine if a given sentence S\ncan actually mean Y (where Y corresponds to a\nparticular scoping)? First, one must filter out cases where the\nunavailability of Y depends on facts about the world, not about\nlanguage. Second, whose intuitions should count: the linguist\u2019s,\nor those of native speakers in a test situation, or perhaps\nstatistical evidence should play a role? Still, while it is true that\nmany readings that seem impossible at first sight are in fact\navailable in sufficiently specific contexts, it is plausible that\nlanguages have scope restrictions beyond the reach of GQ\n theory.[38]\n\nThe \u201cGQ theorist\u201d could reply that her tools were never\nmeant to fully explain scope, or enable compositional analyses of\nevery complex expression. The model-theoretic framework is first of\nall descriptive: it provides mathematical objects that can\nserve as (models of) meaning, and formulate properties of and\nrelations between these objects. Sometimes, facts about the\nmathematical objects reveal insights about the things they are\nmodeling, as in the case of monotonicity and polarity items, or the\ncase of the meaning of conjoined noun phrases. But there is no reason\nto expect this to happen in every case.\n\nThese are positions in an ongoing debate about the role of formal\nmethods, and in particular of model-theoretic tools, in semantics; a\ndebate which is by no means settled. What seems clear is that the\nphenomena related to quantification in natural languages continue to\nprovide excellent material for that discussion. \n",
