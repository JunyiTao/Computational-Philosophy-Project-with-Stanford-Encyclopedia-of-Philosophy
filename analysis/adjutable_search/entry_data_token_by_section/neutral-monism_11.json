    "main_text": "The Case for Neutral Monism || Perceptual Evidence for Physics\n3.3 Perceptual Evidence for Physics\n\nThe Analysis of Matter (Russell 1927a) is widely regarded as\nthe most important text of the neutral monist literature. Chapter one\nof this book, entitled \u201cThe Nature of the Problem\u201d, states\nit as follows:\n\nthe world of physics is, prima facie, so different from the\nworld of perception that it is difficult to see how the one can afford\nevidence for the other; moreover, physics and physiology themselves\nseem to give grounds for supposing that perception cannot give very\naccurate information as to the external world, and thus weaken the\nprops upon which they are built\u2026We must therefore find an\ninterpretation of physics which gives a due place to perceptions; if\nnot, we have no right to appeal to the empirical evidence. (Russell\n1927a: 6\u20137; see also Russell 1948: Part III, Ch. IV)\n\n\nThe previous remarks addressed to the mind-body problem in general,\nand to the problem of perceptual experience in particular, contain the\ncore of the solution Russell proposes. By \u201cbridging the gulf\nbetween physics (as commonly interpreted) and perception\u201d\n(Russell 1927a: 7), neutral monism promises to solve this\nproblem\u2014a problem that Russell took to be difficult and largely\nunnoticed (see Russell 1948: 175\u2013176).\n",
