The word rasa can mean juice, sap,\nessence, condiment or even flavour and refers to the different\nsentiments invoked by a work of art, for example a piece of music.\nSecondly, emotions are discussed within the context of the\nbhakti (devotional) movement. Here particular emphasis is\nplaced on cultivating the emotion of love for a supreme being, e.g.,\n\u015aiva. Thirdly, they are discussed in various tantric traditions.\nThese traditions form a counterbalance to the ascetic ideal of\nclassical philosophical texts (fourth context in which emotions are\ndiscussed) in that they encourage \u201cliving out\u201d emotions\n(and desires) without forming any attachment to them. This entry\nfocuses on the emotions in this fourth context, namely classical\nIndian philosophical thinking, which includes Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical\nas well as Buddhist texts, among others. While there is no equivalent\nfor the term \u201cemotion\u201d in Sanskrit, the concept\nnevertheless plays an important role in Indian philosophy. Terms used\nin Sanskrit texts include vedan\u0101 (feeling) and\nbh\u0101va (feeling) as well as names of individual emotions,\nsuch as r\u0101ga (love, attraction), dve\u1e63a\n(hatred, aversion), har\u1e63a (joy), bhaya (fear)\nand \u015boka (sorrow). One of the reasons why emotions are\nphilosophically interesting in India and the West is their\nrelationship with the mental phenomenon of\nvij\u00f1\u0101na or j\u00f1\u0101na which is\ntranslated as \u201ccognition\u201d. The relationship between\nemotion and cognition is important for any account of reason and\nrationality. While the importance of the emotions for rational\ndeliberation and decision-making has been acknowledged in recent\ndiscussions in the philosophy of mind, the history of Western\nphilosophy contains many views, for example those of Plato, Aristotle,\nand the Stoics, which emphasize the dangerous and destructive role of\nthe emotions. At the heart of these views lies a division of our\nmental lives into cognitions and feelings. Cognitions are\nrepresentational thoughts. They are often regarded as rational because\nthey are capable of representing the external world and therefore they\nprovide us with access to the external world, based on the best\navailable evidence. So, according to this view of rationality, when I\nthink that there is a book on the table, based on my available\nevidence, and there really is one, then my thought is rational.\nHowever, if I am hallucinating that there is a book on the table, my\nthought that there is a book might also be rational because the\navailable evidence points towards this thought. In order to make sure\nthat our thoughts represent reality correctly, we require an account\nof what counts as good evidence, which is one of the main foci of\nepistemology in Indian and Western philosophy. Nevertheless,\ncognitions derive their status as thoughts capable of rationality from\nthe fact that they have objects which represent the external world. By\ncontrast, feelings are some of the non-representational attitudes one\ncan have towards the objects of the representations of our thoughts.\nFor example, when a person thinks about her daughters, she has a\ncognition which represents her daughters. The objects of her thought\nare her daughters and her thought picks them out among various objects\nand subjects in the world. There are several ways in which these\nobjects can be picked out: one can simply have the thought that one\nhas two daughters or one\u2019s thought can be \u201ccoloured\u201d\nwith love and affection. This \u201ccolouring\u201d of thought is\noften regarded as an affect. Together with the thought, it accounts\nfor an emotion. So, the emotion of love, for example, is the thought\nof the object of love plus an affect. The affect is\nnon-representational and regarded as a \u201cmere\u201d feeling.\n\nThe reason why many philosophers regard the emotions as an obstacle to\nrational thought is the influence of the non-representational feeling.\nThe fact that feelings do not seem to have objects means, according to\nsome views, that they can interfere with rational thought. According\nto these views, rational thought, which is representational and\ntherefore object-directed, is subject to disturbing interferences from\nthe feelings. The feelings themselves, however, are non-rational\nbecause they arise due to some physical imbalance in the body, for\nexample through an imbalance of the various \u201chumours\u201d.\nThis imbalance can negatively influence rational thought. An example\nis the person who acts against her better judgment because she is in\nthe grip of some feeling. This is of course also the basis for the\nterm \u201cpassion\u201d as something that we \u201csuffer\u201d,\nwhich was discussed by many philosophers in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries, e.g., Descartes, Spinoza and Hume. Since rational\nthought is an ideal for many philosophers and the feelings can\ninterfere with this ideal, the natural consequence seems to be to\nadvocate for the extinction or at least the control of the feelings\nand, as a consequence, of the emotions. This is what many philosophers\nthroughout the history of philosophy have done, most notably of course\nthe Stoics. While they often recognize that the emotions contain a\ncognitive, and therefore potentially rational, element, they try to\nuncover this element by advocating its separation from the affect. Of\ncourse, if the affect were to be purged from the emotion, the\nresulting cognition would cease to be an emotion.\n\nThere is a parallel between this Western view and a prejudice that\nattaches to Indian philosophy. The prejudice is that Indian\nphilosophy, because of its soteriological nature with its emphasis on\nthe attainment of liberation, is about freeing the mind from feelings\nand emotions because they constitute an attachment to the world. While\nthis is true of some schools of Indian philosophy, it is by no means a\njustified account of Indian philosophy as a whole. The different\npositions within Indian philosophy on this topic are more complex, as\nis the case with regard to Western philosophy. This article introduces\nsome of the main positions regarding the emotions and their relation\nto cognitions in Indian philosophy. The sections of the article\nroughly correspond to the division into philosophical schools in\nclassical Indian philosophy. Since arguably Buddhist philosophers have\npaid more attention to those phenomena that Western philosophers would\nclassify as emotions than other Indian philosophers, the Buddhist\naccount of the emotions will be discussed in more detail than the\nother accounts.\n", "toc": [{"#NyaVaiAccEmo": "1.

The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account of the emotions\n\nThe discussion of this account will focus on the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btras, V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, Uddyotakara\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika and Jayanta\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s Ny\u0101ya-ma\u00f1jar\u012b. In\naddition, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btras together with\n\u015aa\u1e45kara Mi\u015bra\u2019s\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra-upask\u0101ra will be\nmentioned. The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account of the emotions\ninvolves a strict division into cognition (j\u00f1\u0101na)\nand mental phenomena that include a feeling aspect, such as love or\nattraction (r\u0101ga) and aversion (dve\u1e63a).\nOne of the main reasons for this is the acceptance of the existence of\na permanent immaterial self (\u0101tman) by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. According to their\narguments, the \u0101tman is a substance (dravya)\nwhich possesses several qualities (gu\u1e47as), such as\ncognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain. This\nenumeration shows that there is no common Sanskrit term for the\nconcept \u201cemotion\u201d in the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\ntexts. One general term used is sa\u1e43vedana which\ntranslates as \u201cfeeling\u201d, for example\nsukha-sa\u1e43vedana (feeling of pleasure).\n\nThe important aspect of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account is\nthat the individual emotions, such as attachment and aversion are\nregarded as defects (do\u1e63as) [NB 1.1.18] or impurities\n(upadh\u0101) [VS and VSU 6.2.4]. These defects are the\nresult of ignorance (mithy\u0101j\u00f1\u0101na) and they\ngive rise to actions that lead to the feeling of pleasure or pain. The\nreason why this is regarded as negative is that the feeling of\npleasure and pain is responsible for our attachment to the world and,\nmore importantly, for our attachment to the self and therefore\npresents an obstacle to liberation. For this reason, any emotion is\ndeemed to have a negative influence on the individual. However, NV\n1.1.22 mentions one exception, namely the desire for eternal pleasure\nand absence from pain which is final liberation. While, strictly\nspeaking, a desire is not an emotion, it usually has the same negative\neffect because it results in attachment to the object of desire. The\ndesire for eternal pleasure, however, is not detrimental to\nliberation; in fact it is a precondition for liberation.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers clearly distinguish\nbetween pleasure (sukha) and pain (du\u1e25kha) on\nthe one hand and the experience of pleasure (sukha-pratyaya)\nand pain (du\u1e25kha-pratyaya) on the other hand. Pain and\npleasure are qualities of the soul but they need to be cognized by the\nself in order to be experienced. This means that cognition has a\nspecial status among the qualities of self: no other quality can be\nexperienced without cognition.\n\nAnother reason why cognition is an important quality is that it is not\nnecessarily a defect whereas the other qualities are always defects.\nThe defects fall into 3 groups: i) attraction (r\u0101ga),\nii) aversion (dve\u1e63a) and iii) illusion (moha)\n[NS 4.1.3]. Among the first group we find love, selfishness and greed.\nThe second group includes anger, jealousy, envy, malice and\nresentment. The Third group encompasses error, suspicion, pride and\nnegligence. These groupings show that, according to the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account, there are no positive\nemotions. Even love, which is regarded as a positive emotion in many\ncultures, is ultimately a defect because all emotions lead to\nattachment and error.\n\nThe opposite of all three types of defect is described in NB 4.1.4 as\nknowledge of truth (tattvaj\u00f1\u0101na), right knowledge\n(samya\u1e45mati), truthful cognition\n(\u0101ryapraj\u00f1\u0101) and right apprehension\n(sambodha). This shows that, according to the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, emotions are defects\nbecause they prevent our thinking from turning into right knowledge.\nThis knowledge can thus only be had if we eliminate these defects and\nthereby our emotions.\n\nAccording to NS 4.1.6, illusion is the worst defect because without it\nthe others are not going to appear. This means that one has to be\nunder an illusion already in order to think that the object of\none\u2019s attraction provides pleasure and the object of one\u2019s\naversion pain. In fact, NS and NB 4.1.58 state that ordinary pleasure\nshould be regarded as pain:\n\nThe ordinary man, addicted to pleasure, regards pleasure as the\nhighest end of man, and feels that there is nothing better than\npleasure; and hence when pleasure has been attained, he feels happy\nand contented, feeling that all he had to attain had been attained;\nand under the influence of illusion, he becomes attached to the\npleasure, as also to the things that bring about its accomplishment;\nbecoming so attached, he makes an attempt to obtain the pleasure; and\nwhile he is trying for it, there come down on him several kinds of\npain, in the form of birth, old age, disease, death, the contact of\ndisagreeable things, separation from agreeable things, the\nnon-fulfilment of desires and so forth; and yet all these several\nkinds of pain he regards as \u2018pleasure.\u2019 In fact pain is a\nnecessary factor in pleasure; without suffering some pain no pleasure\ncan be obtained; hence as leading to pleasure, this pain is regarded\nby the man as pleasure; and such a man, having his mind obsessed by\nthis notion of \u2018pleasure\u2019, never escapes from\nmetempsychosis, which consists of a running series of births and\ndeaths. And it is as an antidote of this notion of pleasure that we\nhave the teaching that all this should be looked upon as\n\u2018pain.\u2019 [NB 4.1.58, p. 1553]\n\n\nThis quote shows that ultimately the feeling of pleasure is an\nillusion and that our ordinary existence is necessarily beset with\npain. This demonstrates the link between feeling and error, according\nto the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. Both pleasure and\npain are two factors that are responsible for our notion of\n\u201cI\u201d that prevents us from attaining final liberation.\nTherefore, the pursuit of pleasure is futile and ought to be abandoned\nin favour of final liberation.\n\nFor the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, pleasure and\npain are not forms of cognition because they have different causes\nthan cognitions [VS and VSU 10.1.5\u20136]. This means that we can\nhave a cognition without a feeling and we can also have a feeling\nwithout a cognition. In addition, they are experienced differently\n[NM, vol. 1, p. 118]. This separation between cognitions and feelings,\ntogether with the view that feelings are defects that disturb\ncognitions, means that feelings are regarded as purely negative. They\nlead to an attachment to the world which causes a sense of self and\nthis sense of self provides an obstacle to liberation.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view shows similarities with the\nreceived view of the emotions in Western philosophy with regard to the\npoint that feelings are a disturbance of cognition. However, in many\nWestern accounts cognition is regarded as an end in itself because it\ncoincides with the ideal of rational thinking, whereas according to\nthe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers cognition is not an\nend in itself. Rather, it is supposed to lead to the conclusion that\nfinal liberation is the ultimate aim and final liberation means the\nend of cognition.\n2. The Ved\u0101nta account of the emotions\n\nIn his commentary on the Brahma-s\u016btras,\n\u015aa\u1e43kara makes the well-known argument that the self\n(\u0101tman) exists because its existence is the only way to\naccount for the idea of a subject of experience. This argument relies\non the idea that the self has certain mental qualities, which are\ntermed manas (mind), buddhi (intellect),\nvij\u00f1\u0101na (cognition) or citta\n(consciousness), depending on what mental function is ascribed to\nthem. Different mental functions are doubt, resolution, egoism or\nrecollection [BSBh 2.4.6]. These mental functions, regardless of how\nthey are referred to, have several qualities or modifications,\nincluding desire, imagination, doubt, faith, want of faith, memory,\nforgetfulness, shame, reflection and fear [BSBh 2.3.32] as well as\nlove, aversion, pleasure and pain [BSBh 2.3.29]. This means that,\naccording to \u015aa\u1e43kara, the mind\u2019s cognitive and\nemotional abilities are the qualities of our mental functioning which\nis different from the self.\n\nAt the heart of \u015aa\u1e43kara\u2019s teaching lies the notion\nthat the true knowledge of the \u0101tman is knowledge that\nis devoid of any of the above-mentioned qualities. In this respect one\ncan find a similarity between the Ny\u0101ya school and\n\u015aa\u1e43kara because for both of them cognitive and emotional\nqualities are due to false knowledge or ignorance of the true self.\nThis means that the removal of ignorance results in a removal of\nemotions as well as cognitions. However, it is clear that the emotions\npresent the main obstacle for the realization of the true self because\ndesire and aversion lead to attachment and clinging which cause us to\nneglect the search for liberation that is crucial to Ved\u0101nta\nteaching. So, while \u015aa\u1e43kara distinguishes between what\nWestern philosophers would call cognitions and emotions, he does not\npresent a purely cognitive state of mind without emotions as the ideal\nstate of mind because such a state would be impossible. By definition,\nany purely cognitive state of mind presupposes the existence of a mind\nor intellect. For \u015aa\u1e43kara, however, the problem is that a\nmind will always have certain qualities that would be called emotive\nin Western philosophy, such as desire, aversion, hatred, pleasure or\npain. So, as long there are cognitions, there will also be emotions.\nTherefore, both must be eliminated in order for the self to attain\nliberation. On this point, \u015aa\u1e43kara agrees with the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. While \u015aa\u1e43kara\ndistinguishes between emotions and cognitions, his distinction is not\nas pronounced as that of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosophers. He regards both as qualities of the mind or\nintellect.\n3. The S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account of the emotions\n\nUnlike the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and Ved\u0101nta accounts\nof the emotions, the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account does not draw a\nfundamental distinction between feelings and cognitions. The reason\nfor this is that the S\u0101\u1e43khya account rests on the division\nbetween puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti. The former\nis pure consciousness and does not contain any cognitions or feelings\nwhereas prak\u1e5bti is primordial matter and has the three\nqualities (gu\u1e47as) sattva, rajas and\ntamas, which are aligned with different feelings:\nsattva with pleasure (sukha), rajas with\npain (du\u1e25kha) and tamas with confusion or\nillusion (moha). The terms sattva, rajas\nand tamas are difficult to translate but are sometimes\nrendered as \u201creflection\u201d, \u201cactivity\u201d and\n\u201cinertia\u201d. The important point about this dualist\nstructure for the emotions is that, according to the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya account, both cognition and feeling belong to the\nrealm of prak\u1e5bti which means that they are material.\nThis stands in contrast to many dualist accounts in the history of\nWestern philosophy, for example that of Descartes, according to which\ncognitions are immaterial whereas emotions or passions are material,\nthus making it easier to oppose the two. Larson and Bhattacharya\n(1987) summarize the difference between Western and S\u0101\u1e43khya\ndualism in the following way:\n\n[A]ccording to S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy, the experiences of\nintellect, egoity, and mind, and the \u201craw feels\u201d such as\nfrustration or satisfaction\u2014or, in other words, what\nconventional dualists would consider to be \u201cinherently\nprivate\u201d\u2014are simply subtle reflections of primordial\nmateriality, a primordial materiality undergoing continuous\ntransformation by means of its constituent unfolding as spontaneous\nactivity, reflective discerning, and determinate formulation. Thus,\nthe modern reductive materialists\u2019 claim that \u201csensations\nare identical with certain brain processes\u201d would have a\npeculiar counterpart in the S\u0101\u1e43khya claim that\n\u201cawarenesses\u201d [Sanskrit terms omitted] are identical with\ncertain gu\u1e47a modalities. (Larson and Bhattacharya 1987,\np. 76)\n\n\nThe relationship between puru\u1e63a and\nprak\u1e5bti in S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy is complex:\npuru\u1e63a as pure consciousness is characterized by\ninaction (akart\u1e5bbh\u0101va) and pure presence\n(s\u0101k\u1e63itva). It does not stand in any relation with\nprak\u1e5bti, which comprises the material world, including\nmental processes. Nevertheless, puru\u1e63a forms the\nfoundation of prak\u1e5bti. This means that\npuru\u1e63a provides the meaning for all material processes.\nThus prak\u1e5bti exists for puru\u1e63a and it is\nonly because of this that the world is not simply a collection of\nmeaningless physical processes. In addition, the intellect as part of\nprak\u1e5bti is supposed to realize that it is not\nconsciousness and it is to become aware of pure consciousness as the\nway to liberation. This means that the intellect is supposed to\nunderstand the contentless pure consciousness but of course in order\nto do so it would have to become contentless itself, which seems\nimpossible. Therefore, the intellect can only achieve this in an\nindirect way without cognition. Instead, we require meditative or\nyogic exercises to understand the difference between\npuru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti.\n\nIn spite of the fact that cognition and emotion are both material,\nemotions have a negative connotation in S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy.\nIn this regard the account is similar to that of many Western\nphilosophers. However, in Western philosophy the idea is to have\ncognition free from emotion. By contrast, the S\u0101\u1e43khya\nphilosophers do not think of cognition as a desirable end in itself.\nRather, their idea is that ultimate liberation lies in the recognition\nof puru\u1e63a by prak\u1e5bti. This means that\nour everyday experience of ourselves as conscious intellects with\ncognitions and emotions is an obstacle on the way to realizing what\npure contentless consciousness is. In fact, S\u0101\u1e43khya\nphilosophers argue that our experience of ourselves as conscious\nbeings is a mistake that needs to be rectified in order to achieve\nliberation. This realization is extremely difficult to achieve and\ntherefore S\u0101\u1e43khya proposes first of all to clear the mind\nof the passions [SSu 2.15] by separating them from cognition and then\nto free the mind from cognition in order to comprehend contentless\nconsciousness. So emotions or passions are regarded as negative but\nthey are not contrasted with cognitions because cognitions themselves\nare supposed to be overcome in order to understand\npuru\u1e63a.\n\nIn the Yogas\u016btras, Pata\u00f1jali provides a method\nfor understanding the difference between puru\u1e63a and\nprak\u1e5bti via a series of exercises that aim at stripping\naway all of the disturbing influences from the mind, including what\nWestern philosophers would classify as emotions. In fact,\nPata\u00f1jali argues that the mind is affected by afflictions\n(kle\u015bas) that keep it from becoming clear about the\ndifference between puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti.\nIn YS 2.3, Pata\u00f1jali lists the afflictions:\n\nIgnorance (avidy\u0101), egoism (asmit\u0101),\nattachment (r\u0101ga), aversion (dve\u1e63a) and\nadherence [to mundane existence] (abhinive\u015ba) are\nafflictions. [YS 2.3]\n\n\nThese afflictions need to be removed in order to achieve liberation.\nUnlike in many Western accounts of the emotions, the removal of the\nafflictions is not supposed to lead to a form of rational thinking\nthat is divorced from any emotion. Rather, rational thinking itself\nneeds to be overcome, in order to achieve true liberation by\nseparating puru\u1e63a from prak\u1e5bti.\n\nThe main reason why emotions such as attachment and aversion are\nregarded as afflictions is that they lead to a desire to change our\ncircumstances and therefore to an attachment to the world. This\nattachment, however, is precisely what is to be given up in order to\nachieve liberation. So, Pata\u00f1jali and his commentators argue\nthat emotions lead to desire and therefore have to be given up as one\nof the root causes of ignorance that causes attachment to the world.\nOnly then can the mind discriminate between puru\u1e63a and\nprak\u1e5bti.\n\nOne interesting parallel between Western accounts of the emotions and\nPata\u00f1jali is the use of the \u201ccolouring\u201d\n(upar\u0101ga) or \u201ccoloured\u201d (uparaktam)\nmetaphor with regard to the mind [e.g., in YS 4.23]. Pata\u00f1jali\nclaims that the mind is \u201ccoloured\u201d by all of the objects\nit knows, including cognitions and emotions. This means that in order\nto understand the difference between itself and pure consciousness\n(puru\u1e63a), it has to free itself from these colourings\nand become pure. Only then can it recognize that it is different from\nthe puru\u1e63a which cannot be known in itself because it\ncannot become an object of the mind. Vy\u0101sa, in his commentary on\nYS 4.23, explains that the mind itself is an object that appears as a\nconscious subject which is why many philosophers mistake it for the\nsubject. However, once the mind becomes empty of all objects the\ndifference between the mind and puru\u1e63a reveals itself.\nVy\u0101sa makes the argument that a mind which is empty of all\nobjects can still know itself and thus it would have to become an\nobject in the mind, i.e., itself. In other words, cognition would have\nto be cognized by itself. This, however, is impossible, according to\nhim. Instead, puru\u1e63a shows itself as that which makes\ncognition possible. In this sense, puru\u1e63a can be\ncompared to Husserl\u2019s idea of the \u201ctranscendental\nego\u201d. So, puru\u1e63a can only reveal itself\nindirectly by emptying the mind of all cognitions, including emotions.\nThis means that emotions are regarded as an obstacle to liberation but\nat the same time, they share this designation with other cognitions of\nthe world.\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account of the emotions thus shows some\nsimilarities with the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account in that\nboth regard the emotions as the first obstacle to liberation. Both\naccounts differ from many Western views in that they regard\nemotion-free thinking not as an end in itself but as the next obstacle\nto be removed. For the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga philosophers there is a\ndistinction between veridical and non-veridical cognition\n(vij\u00f1\u0101na). The latter is classified as ignorance\n(avidy\u0101), which, together with certain emotions, forms\nthe afflictions (kle\u015bas). The Yoga-s\u016btras\n[YS 2.4] emphasize that ignorance is the most fundamental affliction\nthat is the root of all other afflictions. In his commentary on YS\n2.3, Vy\u0101sa states that \u201cthe afflictions are the five forms\nof unreal cognition.\u201d So, as Sinha points out:\n\nAll afflictions (kle\u015ba) are due to false knowledge\n(avidy\u0101) and can be destroyed by right knowledge. The\nYoga, like Spinoza, regards emotions as intellectual disorders which\ncan be cured by true knowledge. [Footnote omitted] (Sinha 1985, p. 97)\n\n\nWe therefore see similarities between a cognitive account of the\nemotions and the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account because both claim\nthat emotions have mental objects but at the same time there is a\ndifference in how emotions can relate to knowledge, with the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga philosophers claiming that knowledge and\nemotions are incompatible.\n4. The Buddhist account of the emotions\n\nWhile there are many nuances in the accounts of the emotions among\nBuddhist writers, there are also certain key ideas that are common to\nall of them. This section, tries to bring out these key ideas by\nanalyzing some of the writings of the Buddhist philosophers\nDharmak\u012brti, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla.\n4.1 Buddhist cognition\n\nAs with other Indian accounts of the emotions, the Buddhist conception\nof emotion appears in the context of the discussion about the role of\ncognition (vij\u00f1\u0101na). Buddhist philosophers argue\nagainst the existence of a self (\u0101tman). At the same\ntime, they acknowledge the existence of a non-physical momentary\nconsciousness or chain of cognitions (sant\u0101na\nvij\u00f1\u0101na) which carries over from former births into\nthe present and future rebirths. Thus, Buddhists try to find a middle\nground between a permanent non-physical self and the materialism of\nthe Lok\u0101yata school (materialist school of philosophy) which\nargues that the self is purely the result of bodily processes.\nAccording to the materialists, the self comes into existence with the\nbody and ceases to exist when the body ceases to exist.\n\nIn the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-siddhi-chapter of the\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101rttika, Dharmak\u012brti argues\nthat past lives exist. We can know this because of the authority of\nthe Buddha and we have reason to accept his authority because of his\ninfinite compassion. This compassion can only be the result of\npractice over many life times [PV 36]. The Lok\u0101yata philosophers\nargue that cognitions require the support of a body and therefore\ncease to exist when the body ceases to exist. Dharmak\u012brti objects\nto this by arguing that mental cognitions do not derive from any\nphysical support [PV 49]. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla state that the relationship between the support\nand what is supported can be analyzed either as a causal relationship\nor as the relationship between an object and its capacity [TS and TSP\n1858\u20131859]. In this respect they do not deviate from\nDharmak\u012brti who rejects this position of the Lok\u0101yata\nphilosophers by arguing that the body could be neither the cause of\ncognition nor could it have the capacity of cognition. Franco explains\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s argument in the following way:\n\nIf the body were one lasting and changeless entity from birth to\ndeath, it could not produce cognitions gradually, and thus all the\ncognitions one has throughout one\u2019s life would be produced at\nonce. If the body were the material cause of the cognition, the\ncognition would last as long as the body, and thus there could be no\ndead body (v. 51). If the breaths are considered the cause of\ncognition, the same inadmissible consequence applies: Because the body\nis the material cause of the breaths, the breaths would last as long\nas the body and the cognition as long as the breaths (v. 53). All\nthese inadmissible consequences do not apply if one admits that\ncognition is the cause of cognition. (Franco 1997, pp. 134\u2013135)\n\n\nOf course, there is no reason why the Lok\u0101yata philosophers\nshould say that the body is changeless. It might precisely be the\nchanges that appear in the body, for example in the brain, which are\nresponsible for cognition. Dharmak\u012brti argues that if cognition\nrequired the support of the body, there is no reason why it should not\narise everywhere where there exists a body or matter [PV 37\u201338].\nThe obvious objection to this argument is that not any form of matter\nsupports cognition. It has to be a particular kind of matter, ordered\nin a particular way, as is the case in human beings and many\nanimals.\n\nAccording to Buddhist \u201cpsychology\u201d, love and hatred are\ntwo of the afflictions (kle\u015bas) that befall human beings\nand that need to be removed in order to attain liberation. There are a\nnumber of sections in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi,\npossibly written by either Asa\u1e45ga or Maitreya, that discuss\nthese kle\u015bas. The text provides several lists, most of\nwhich include love (r\u0101ga) and hatred or enmity\n(pratigha). Other kle\u015bas are:\nsatk\u0101ya-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di (false view with regard\nto the satk\u0101ya (five skandhas)), attachment to\nextreme views, attachment to unwholesome views, attachment to\npractices and observances, pride, ignorance and doubt. These\nkle\u015bas could be associated with one or more of the five\npossible feelings: pleasant feeling (sukha), unpleasant\nfeeling (du\u1e25kha), neutral feeling\n(upek\u1e63\u0101), happy mood (sau-manasya) or\nunhappy mood (daur-manasya). A translation of the\npsychological categories of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi\ninto the categories of Western philosophy of mind would render the\nfollowing distinctions: a kle\u015ba is a mental phenomenon\nthat consists of a representation of an object plus a certain feeling,\nsensation or affect. For example, in the case of love, the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi states that we have the object\nof love plus either a pleasant sensation or a happy mood or\nindifference (neutral feeling). It is interesting to note that the\nmental phenomenon of love can be connected with indifference. In\ngeneral, this suggests that a sensation is comparable to a\npsychological attitude and that we always have to have one attitude or\nanother towards a mental object. This means that our thinking is never\nwithout a feeling, even if it is a \u201cneutral\u201d feeling. It\nis unclear, however, in what way we could experience the emotion of\nlove with the sensation of indifference. It seems that love always\nrequires a positive feeling. The\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi allows for a mental phenomenon\nto count as the experience of love, as long as it does not involve a\n\u201cnegative\u201d, i.e., unhappy or unpleasant, feeling.\n\nIn addition, the text acknowledges that a representation can be about\na real object or an imagined object. In the latter case, the question\narises in what way we can distinguish between an object and its\nrepresentation. This suggests that at least some Buddhist traditions\ndistinguish between a cognition, the object of a cognition and the\nfeeling accompanying a cognition. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nmentions kle\u015bas in TS 1955 and it is obvious that he\noperates within the context of this psychological distinction which\nbecomes clear in his discussion of love (r\u0101ga) and\nhatred (dve\u1e63a).\n4.2 \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita on love and hatred\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that love and hatred exist due to\nhabit and repetition which is ascertained by confirming and\ndisconfirming concomitance. This means that they are learned through\nexperience. For example, love is learned by a person being confronted\nwith objects to which this feeling is attributed and thus reinforced\nthe more of these objects a person encounters. However, we can observe\nthe existence of love and hatred in babies who have not had the\nrepeated experience of these objects in this life.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita claims that the existence of love and\nhatred cannot be due to the first encounter with the object of love or\nhatred because it would be possible, as indeed happens according to\nhim, to encounter this object without the respective feelings of love\nor hatred or to encounter it with another feeling, such as disgust. As\nan example, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita mentions the attraction a man\nmight feel towards a woman. He claims that men are attracted to women\nif they also attribute \u201cgoodness\u201d and\n\u201cdevotedness\u201d to them, even though a particular woman\nmight not possess these qualities. So the qualities that make, for\nexample, a woman \u201clovable\u201d do not have to exist in the\nwoman and therefore, according to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the\nwoman cannot be said to be the cause of the feeling of love in the\nman. Love, then is not an object of the senses\n(vi\u1e63aya). Therefore, the reason why these feelings\nexist is through force of habit in previous lives. We have learned\nover time that women are \u201clovable\u201d. This argument is meant\nto demonstrate that love and hatred could not exist if the\nmaterialists were right and mental life was simply the result of\nbodily processes.\n\nKamala\u015b\u012bla explains this argument in his commentary on TS\n1948\u20131953 in a rather straightforward way and adds a very\nhelpful example:\n\nFor the following reason also, the feelings of Love, etc. cannot be\ndue to presence of the excitants:\u2013Because, if the feelings\nappeared exactly in accordance with the excitants, they would proceed\nfrom the excitant exactly in the same manner as the Cognition of Blue\nand other things (which always proceeds in accordance with these\nthings);\u2013the feelings however do not proceed in this way; on the\ncontrary, the said feelings appear in regard to the Woman and other\nthings, in men who attribute to the woman the form of their own\nlasting pleasure, etc. which have not been experienced at all; and yet\nthe objects (woman, etc.) are not actually possessed of the said form\nof goodness, etc.;\u2013and when a thing is devoid of a certain form,\nit cannot be the excitant or basis of the Cognition of that form;\notherwise it would lead to absurdity. (TSP: 931)\n\n\nIn this passage, Kamala\u015b\u012bla draws a distinction between the\ncognition of blue and the feeling of love. His point is that the\ncognition of blue is a perception and therefore requires an object\nwhereas a feeling of love does not. There is no basis for love in the\nway that there is a basis for our perception of blue. So,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s argument, as explained by\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, consists of two parts: a) love, hatred etc. are\nlearned through experience and reinforced by repetition and b) love,\nhatred etc. are not perceptions.\n\nIn TS 1958, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita provides a similar example of\nmale animals that become \u201cperturbed\u201d by the touch of\nfemale animals even though they do not know anything about any\n\u201cdoings\u201d (v\u1e5btt\u0101nta) or sexual\nintercourse, yet. His argument is that this feeling must be due to\nexperiences in previous lives. He does not account for the possibility\nof instinctual behaviour. If \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita allowed for\nthe existence of instinctual behaviour then his observation of babies\nand animals might have let him to believe that love and hatred are\nmental phenomena that are not learned through experience.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita clearly believes that there is something\nfundamental about the feelings of love and hatred. They are so\nfundamental that even babies feel them. At the same time, they require\nexperience. So the question is how was the first feeling of love (or\nhatred) acquired? There might have been a time when humans did not\nhave the feeling of love and they only acquired it at some point in\ntheir lives through experience and subsequent repetition of the\nexperience. This sounds like a strange idea precisely because love and\nhatred are so fundamental to our unenlightened lives that the\nexistence of a time when they did not exist seems impossible. Yet,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s view implies either that there\nmust have been such a time or that there is an infinite chain of these\nfeelings stretching backwards. In TS 1872,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita makes it clear that he believes in the\nlatter option:\n\nAs regards the \u201cother world\u201d, there is no such\n\u201cother world\u201d, apart from the \u201cchain of causes and\neffects, in the form of cognition and the rest\u201d. What is spoken\nof as \u201cthe other world\u201d or \u201cthis world\u201d, that\nis only by way of a certain limit placed upon the said\n\u201cchain\u201d which is beginningless and endless. (TS 1872)\n\n\nSo, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita might argue that love and hatred are\njust as much part of a \u201cchain of cognitions\u201d that is\nwithout beginning and end as all other cognitions. The reason why he\npostulates the existence of this eternal \u201cchain of\ncognitions\u201d is the argument that no cognition could be caused by\nanything other than a previous cognition and hence there cannot be a\nfirst cognition for anything we call a particular being. If there was\na first cognition for a particular being then, according to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (TS 1878\u20131885), there would be five\noptions: i) the first cognition does not have a cause; ii) it is\nproduced by an eternal cause; iii) it is eternal and unchanging; iv)\nit is caused by another substance; and v) it is caused by a cognition\n\u201cfrom another chain\u201d.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita rejects the first option because he\nargues that according to this idea the foetus would somehow receive\nthe first cognition without any cause. This means that the cognition\nwould be eternal, rather than momentary. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nrejects the second option because if the cognition is produced by an\neternal non-material cause then it should itself be eternal. The\nargument is that if something which exists eternally can bring about a\ncognition then there is no point in time at which this cause could\nhave brought about the effect. So the effect is eternal in the same\nway as the cause. But an eternal effect cannot exist because something\nwhich is eternal does not have a cause. The third option that the\ncognition is eternal runs counter to our experience which tells us\nthat cognitions are momentary. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita also\ndismisses the Lok\u0101yata position that cognitions are produced by\nphysical substances because the Lok\u0101yata philosophers argue that\nmaterial substances are eternal. So, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nmakes a similar argument to the rejection of option two. An eternal\ncause has to have an eternal effect but cognitions are not eternal.\nOption five is rejected in TS 1893\u20131896 where\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that the first cognition of one\nchain cannot be solely caused by a cognition from another chain\nbecause in that case we would expect the knowledge of parents to carry\nover into their babies.\n\nThe second part (b) of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s argument,\nthat love and hatred are different from perception, is intriguing in\nthat he claims that there cannot be an external cause for love and\nhatred because whatever we might want to postulate as this external\nobject can elicit different feelings in different people. The object\nof one person\u2019s love might be the object of another\nperson\u2019s aversion. For this reason, love and hatred cannot be\nacquired in this life, like perceptions. So the love and hatred that\nexist in a baby or young animal must be carried over from another\nlife. This argument assumes that there could not be non-perceptual\ncognition that can arise without previous experience and therefore\nfaces the same challenges as the claim that all feelings have to be\nlearned through repeated experience. But it goes beyond this\ndiscussion in that it raises the question of what the object of love\nand hatred is. Kamala\u015b\u012bla uses the term va\u015ba\n(desire, love) rather than r\u0101ga in his commentary on TS\n1948\u20131953 which suggests that he does not clearly distinguish\nbetween desire and love. If it is true that r\u0101ga is a\nkle\u015ba then it is plausible that there is no distinction\nbetween love and craving. So he could be making the obvious point that\nwe can desire something without a basis in the external world, i.e.,\nwhat I desire might not exist, or that I might desire something for\nthe wrong reasons. Love, hatred and desire all require the existence\nof an object. However, unlike a perceptual object, the objects of love\nand desire can be \u201cmerely\u201d mental. I can love the idea of\nequality or I can desire something which does not exist. This\n\u201cnon-existence\u201d can be two-fold: i) I can desire something\nwhich cannot exist either logically or physically, for example, I can\ndesire that I had wings; ii) if I desire something to be the case,\nthen what I desire does not exist, yet. For example, if I desire an\nice-cream then the state of affairs in which I have an ice-cream does\nnot exist, yet. In contrast with love and desire, perception, at least\non a realist account, requires its object to exist in the external\nworld.\n4.3 Cognitions, emotions and kle\u015bas\n\nWhile the argument about the difference between perception and love\ndoes not show that love requires previous experience, it raises, (at\nleast) two interesting questions about the Buddhist account of the\nemotions: i) why does \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita draw a distinction\nbetween perception and feeling on the basis of the non-existence of\nexternal objects in the case of love, hatred and desire? ii) why does\nhe make a specific argument about love and hatred when he has already\nargued in previous verses of the\nLok\u0101yata-par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 that all cognitions\nrequire other cognitions as their causes?\n\nIn what follows, these questions are addressed briefly in reverse\norder. The second question raises the general problem of the\ntranslatability of the concept of feeling or emotion into Sanskrit. As\nmentioned in the introduction, there is no general term in Sanskrit\nfor emotion and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita uses the expression\n\u201clove and hatred etc.\u201d (r\u0101ga-dve\u1e63a +\n\u0101di). In the translation, Jha has taken the\n\u201cetc.\u201d as referring to other feelings, assuming that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was operating with a psychological\ncategory such as \u201cfeeling\u201d. However, there is no single\nword in the text which would translate as feeling every time it\nappears in the translation. In fact, it is clear that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita does not mean \u201cfeelings\u201d in\nthe sense of non-representational attitudes towards objects because\nlove and hatred have objects according to him, albeit mental objects.\nSince \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita remains within the context of\nBuddhist psychology and clearly refers to Dharmak\u012brti, it is\nplausible that he means \u201cother kle\u015bas\u201d\ninstead of \u201cother feelings\u201d because love and hatred are\nkle\u015bas and have objects.\n\nIn this context, it is also important to discuss the translation of\nthe term vij\u00f1\u0101na as \u201ccognition\u201d. Both\nterms refer to a mental phenomenon that provides knowledge. This means\nthat they refer to a state of affairs that pertains in the world. Both\nterms presuppose an external or mental object they are directed\ntowards. One important difference between these two terms, which shows\nthe difficulty with translating vij\u00f1\u0101na as\ncognition, is that, according to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, a\nvij\u00f1\u0101na always has an object but it does not have\nto have conceptual content. In this sense, even a sensation or\nfeeling, such as the sensation of pleasure, is a\nvij\u00f1\u0101na because it has an object but lacks\nconceptual content, according to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita. The\nsensation has an object because it provides knowledge about mental\nstates and therefore has to have an object of knowledge. However, this\nobject is not conceptual. So, according to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, a vij\u00f1\u0101na includes\naffective mental states, such as feelings, sensations and emotions and\ntherefore kle\u015bas. The Western term\n\u201ccognition\u201d, by contrast, excludes affective mental\nstates.\n\nThe whole of the Lok\u0101yata-par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 of the\nTattva-sa\u1e43graha is one argument for the existence of an\ninfinite chain of vij\u00f1\u0101nas that is independent of\nits physical manifestation. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\n\u201clove, hatred and the rest\u201d are examples of\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas. These vij\u00f1\u0101nas are\nalso kle\u015bas but not all vij\u00f1\u0101nas\nare kle\u015bas. Love and hatred are especially useful for\nhis argument because they are fundamental to our experience and\nemphasize the continuity of the \u201cchain of\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas\u201d.\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas can include feelings and emotions\nwhereas in Western psychology and philosophy cognitions are distinct\nfrom emotions and feelings. This means that the role of\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nsystem is different from the role of cognitions in Western psychology\nand philosophy. As I mentioned above, in the history of Western\nphilosophy the distinction between feeling and cognition has often\nbeen used as the demarcation between feeling and rational thought with\nthe ideal of affectless thought. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nother Buddhist philosophers the ideal is not necessarily that of\naffectless thought. Instead, their ideal is that of an existence free\nfrom afflictions (kle\u015bas). So, they try to extinguish\none kind of mental phenomenon but their distinction is different from\nthe distinction between feeling and thought. For them, all mental\nphenomena that provide an obstacle to liberation should be eliminated.\nThis includes what Western psychologists would call emotions or\nfeelings. However, it also includes many affectless cognitions. This\nmeans that the Western psychological category \u201cemotions\u201d\ndoes not feature prominently in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\naccount of the mind. In fact, it is not clear that he would even\nrecognize such a category. According to Buddhist psychology, some\nkle\u015bas straddle the Western divide between feeling and\nthought. They involve both feeling and thought and they are a mental\nphenomenon, called a vij\u00f1\u0101na. Whereas for many\nphilosophers in the history of Western philosophy, the ideal has been\nto purge feeling from thought, in order to attain a standard of\nrationality, the ideal for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and other\nBuddhist philosophers is to free our mental life from those\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas which are kle\u015bas. The\nreason is not to attain some standard of rationality because, for\nBuddhists, most vij\u00f1\u0101nas are suspect in that they\ninvolve an attachment to the present life and therefore pose an\nobstacle to liberation.\n\nOne question that arises in this context is \u201cwhy does\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita single out love and hatred, instead of\ndiscussing kle\u015bas in general?\u201d. One answer might\nbe that they are fundamental to our human experience and therefore\nlend themselves to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s argument that\ncognitions in general do not come into existence with the body.\n\nIn Western discussions of this topic, feelings are very often\nassociated with some physical change, such as a quicker heartbeat or a\nchange in the chemical make up of the brain. For this reason, emotions\nare very often regarded as providing some link between the mental and\nthe physical. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita mentions this link between\nfeeling and physical changes in TS 1960. He claims that phlegm\n(bal\u0101sa) and other bodily changes are not responsible\nfor love, hatred or perturbations through sexual arousal because there\nis no observed concomitance between them. While this claim might be\ntrue with regard to phlegm, it is obviously false with regard to other\nphysical changes, especially changes in the brain. However, it would\nbe wrong to completely dismiss \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nargument simply because he turned out to be wrong about this empirical\nclaim. After all, the argument raises important questions about the\nstatus of mental phenomena, such as love and hatred. This becomes\nclear when we think about the other question mentioned earlier: why\ndoes \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita distinguish between perceptions on\nthe one hand and love and hatred on the other hand based on the\nexistence or non-existence of external objects? While\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita often adopts an idealist position\ncompatible with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra standpoint in the\nTattva-sa\u1e43graha, he seems to switch to a realist\nposition in this case which is compatible with a\nSaut\u0101ntrika standpoint. The best explanation for this\nswitch is that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla\nare arguing against Lok\u0101yata philosophers (materialists), who do\nnot share the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra outlook on reality. This means that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla try to find\ncommon ground with these philosophers and therefore share their\nassumptions about the mind-independent existence of an external world.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s and Kamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s\nargument then is that even with this assumption in place, it does not\nfollow that all cognitions are dependent on or even identical with the\nbody. According to them, the Lok\u0101yata philosophers would have to\ndraw a distinction between perceptions on the one hand and love and\nhatred on the other hand, and while they might be able to account for\nperceptions they are not able to account for love and hatred.\n4.4 Buddhist emotions\n\nFrom the preceding arguments by the Buddhist philosophers\nDharmak\u012brti, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla it becomes clear that Buddhist philosophers do\nnot operate with the psychological category \u201cemotion\u201d; at\nleast not in the way that other Indian (and Western) philosophers do.\nFor example, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla do\nnot consider love and hatred to be irrational because they involve\nnon-cognitive feelings that do not represent an external reality.\nKamala\u015b\u012bla in particular makes it clear that for him love\nand hatred do not require a relationship to objects in the external\nworld. He argues that not having an external object is a salient\nfeature of love and hatred. In Western philosophy of mind we often use\nthe presence or absence of an object of love in order to distinguish\nbetween rational and irrational love. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, however, do not use this distinction in order to\nargue that love and hatred should be eliminated. As Buddhists, their\nconcern lies with the afflictions that prevent the mind from becoming\nliberated and whatever mental state is an affliction ought to be\neliminated. Emotions then are vij\u00f1\u0101nas and as\nsuch they always have an object. This position stands in contrast to\nphilosophical traditions, be they Indian or Western, in which feelings\nand emotions are often distinguished from cognitions because they lack\nan object.\n5. Conclusion\n\nA number of themes emerge from this overview: 1) The Western\ncategories of \u201ccognition\u201d and \u201cemotion\u201d do not\nhave equivalents in classical Indian philosophy. This is interesting\nbecause it suggests that these concepts are not psychological\ncategories but perhaps social categories. While there has been some\nanthropological work done by, for example, Catherine Lutz on the\ndifferences in the categorization of specific emotions across\ncultures, there is the possibility that the category as a whole might\nnot translate into all cultures (see Danziger 1997). 2) One common\ntheme in classical Indian philosophy is that the phenomena that would\nbe labelled as \u201cemotions\u201d in Western philosophy are to be\neradicated because they prevent liberation. 3) None of the Indian\nphilosophical schools aim at \u201cemotion-free\u201d cognitions as\nan end in itself. In fact, those states that would be labelled\n\u201ccognitions\u201d in Western philosophy are also to be\neradicated because they also prevent liberation. 4) Indian schools\ndiffer over the inclusion of feeling states under the concept of\nvij\u00f1\u0101na (cognition). Some schools distinguish\nbetween feeling states and vij\u00f1\u0101na whereas\nothers, most notably Buddhists, do not. This last point suggests that\nthere is an interesting comparison to be made between Buddhist\naccounts and cognitive accounts of the emotions. However, any\ncomparison must be sensitive to the difficulties in translating the\nconcepts involved.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "[BSBh]", "\u015aa\u1e43kara,\n<em>Brahma-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya</em>; (1) <em>Brahmas\u016btra\nwith \u015aa\u1e43karabh\u0101\u1e63ya, works of\nSa\u1e43kar\u0101carya in original Sanskrit, vol. 3</em>, Delhi:\nMotial Banarsidass, 2007; (2) V.
