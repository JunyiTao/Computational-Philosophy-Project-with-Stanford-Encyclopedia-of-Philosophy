Strictly speaking, this constitutes an elementary category\nmistake. In relativistic physics, as in classical physics, mass and\nenergy are both regarded as properties of physical systems or\nproperties of the constituents of physical systems. If one wishes to\ntalk about the physical stuff that is the bearer of such\nproperties, then one typically talks about either \u201cmatter\u201d\nor \u201cfields.\u201d The distinction between \u201cmatter\u201d\nand \u201cfields\u201d in modern physics is itself rather subtle in\nno small part because of the equivalence of mass and energy.\nPhilosophically, to think of fields as stuff is also controversial.\n\n\nNevertheless, we can assert that whatever sense of\n\u201cconversion\u201d seems compelling between mass and energy, it\nwill have to be a \u201cconversion\u201d between mass and\nenergy, and not between matter and energy. Finally, our\nobservation obtains even in so-called \u201cannihilation\u201d\nreactions where the entire mass of the incoming particles seems to\n\u201cdisappear\u201d (see, for example, Baierlein (2007, p.\u00a0323)). Of course, the older terminology of \u201cmatter\u201d and\n\u201canti-matter\u201d in the description of annihilation reactions\ndoes not really help our philosophical understanding of mass-energy\nequivalence and is perhaps partly to blame for some of the\nmisconceptions surrounding \\(E_o = mc^2\\).\n",
