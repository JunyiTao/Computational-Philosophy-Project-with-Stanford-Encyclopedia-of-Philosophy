    "main_text": "Special Relativity\n4. Special Relativity\n\n\nSchlick availed himself of the opportunity to elaborate his\nepistemological views in application to the new physics of Relativity\nin his 1915 essay on \u201cThe Philosophical Significance of the\nPrinciple of Relativity\u201d (1979a, 153\u2013189). This essay\nis particularly significant in Schlick\u2019s development since it\nfirst presented certain philosophical tenets which would figure in all\nhis subsequent work. Implicit in the general philosophical scheme\nin which Schlick discussed Relativity is an objective, logical\ndistinction between the representational framework in which scientific\nclaims may be formulated and those claims themselves. An\nintrinsic function of the representational scheme is the constitution\nof the very concepts in which the formulation of empirical claims is\nfirst made possible. Moreover, since the same empirical claims\nmay be expressed in distinct representational schemes, the content\nwhich is expressed by all the differing conceptual frameworks comprises\nthe common, objective content of scientific assertions. In\ncontrast, what varies from one description to another reflects the\nfeatures of the representational systems which distinguish them from\none another.\n\n\nSchlick applied these insights to the fact that no physical means\nsuffice to distinguish inertial frames or, in other words, no (uniform,\nrectilinear) motion can be detected relative to the ether. There\nare two alternative responses to this situation. The first\nalternative, due to Lorentz and Fitzgerald, accommodates experimental\nfindings through the postulation of compensating contractions of moving\nbodies in the direction of motion. Buttressed by additional\nauxiliary hypotheses, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald hypothesis preserves the\nabsolute space and time of Euclid and Newton, as well as Galilean\nkinematics, while explicating experimental failures to detect the\nabsolute rest of the ether by positing a real effect of absolute motion\non length. The alternative presented by Einstein in the Special\nTheory was simply to deny the presupposition of an absolute time\nreference, allowing that two spatially separated events may be\ntemporally ordered in one way for a given system of reference and may\nalso be ordered differently for a distinct, yet equally legitimate\nsystem. Contractions of length are then a consequence of the\nrelativity of reference frames: the length of a measuring rod depends\non its velocity for a given frame of reference (Schlick 1979a,\n160\u20131). Consequently, the facts of observation are accommodated\nequally well by the Principle of Special Relativity as they are by the\nLorentz-Fitzgerald hypotheses. In other words, they are\nequivalent or \u201cboth theories do the same thing\u201d. \n(Schlick 1979a, 162) The principal advantage of Einstein\u2019s\napproach is that his solution is clearly the simplest. At this\njuncture, it should be noted that Schlick did not argue that the choice\nbetween the available alternatives is conventional because they are\nempirically equivalent, implying all the same observational\nconsequences. Rather, Schlick repeatedly urged that there is an\nunderlying physical equivalence from which the empirical or\nobservational equivalence follows. And the fact that it is the\nphysical rather than observational equivalence which serves as premise\nof his argument is especially evident from his use of his earlier\nanalysis of the concept of truth to explicate the equivalence.\n\n\nSchlick thought the situation in physics presented a thorough-going\nanalogy with Poincar\u00e9\u2019s treatment of the conventionality\nof geometry. Schlick noted, first of all, that\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometric conventionalism was founded on the\nKantian insight that it is only the behavior of bodies in space that\nforms the object of study, so that the resulting physics is \u201cthe\nproduct of two factors, namely the spatial properties of bodies and\ntheir physical properties in the narrower sense\u201d (Schlick 1979a,\n169; Cf. also 1979a, 230\u2013233). The point of Schlick\u2019s\nreference to Poincar\u00e9 is to illustrate the particular variety of\nconventionalism operative in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s treatment of\ngeometry, in order to apply it to the case of Special Relativity. \nAnd just as Poincar\u00e9 isolated two factors in the treatment of\nthe motion of rigid bodies, in general any true theory may be regarded\nas the product of a reference-system, or representational scheme, and\nthe judgments formulated in that system. Since there are\nalternative ways of securing univocal coordination, the components with\nrespect to which distinct but equivalent representations differ are\nartifices of the representational scheme. Parting from\nPoincar\u00e9, Schlick recognized that the representational framework\nthat appears simplest when regarded in isolation may nonetheless\nrequire excessively complicated formulations for the description of\nreality. And he insisted \u2013 contra\nPoincar\u00e9 \u2013 that it is the simplicity of these formulations that\nis the most compelling desideratum, not the simplicity of the\nrepresentational scheme. Thus, the representational scheme that\nallows for the simplest description of reality is always to be\npreferred \u2013 so much the worse for Euclid, and Poincar\u00e9,\ntoo.\n",
