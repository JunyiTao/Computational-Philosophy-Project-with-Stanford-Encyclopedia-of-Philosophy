    "main_text": "Metaphysics: A Primer on Substance || Unity\n4.2 Unity\n\n\nIf a finite substance is to have a CIC, as Leibniz claims in \u00a78\nof the Discourse on Metaphysics, what is its ontological\nstatus? That is, what kind of thing could have such a CIC or such a\nnature? Leibniz's answer to this question brings to the fore\nanother paradigm of substancehood: unity. While it is the nature of an\nindividual substance to have a CIC, only a genuine unity can\nqualify as a substance. Leibniz expresses his position in a letter to\nArnauld in a very clear and forceful manner: \u201cTo put it briefly,\nI hold this identical proposition, differentiated only by the emphasis,\nto be an axiom, namely, that what is not truly\none being is not truly one\nbeing either.\u201d (G II 97/AG 86)\nIn the period of the Discourse on Metaphysics and\nCorrespondence with Arnauld, Leibniz appeals to certain Scholastic\nnotions, chief among them, the notion of a substantial form. In later\nyears, the Scholastic way of speaking fades away, but the fundamental\nidea remains the same: there must be something that guarantees or makes\npossible the unity of a substance, and this is the substantial form or\nthe soul. The point Leibniz wants to make is that only a soul or a\nsubstantial form is the kind of thing that can be said to have or\nunderlie a complete individual concept, for only a soul or substantial\nform is by its nature an imperishable unity. Leibniz makes\nthis point very clear in another letter to Arnauld: \u201cA\nsubstantial unity requires a thoroughly indivisible and naturally\nindestructible being, since its notion includes everything that will\nhappen to it, something which can be found neither in shape nor in\nmotion (both of which involve something imaginary, as I could\ndemonstrate), but which can be found in a soul or substantial form, on\nthe model of what is called me\u201d (G II 76/AG 79). Thus,\nunity is the hallmark of a genuine substance, but equally important is\nLeibniz's paradigm case of a substance: the self. This\nthought underlies much of Leibniz's reflections on the nature of\nsubstance and has important consequences. For, following not only\nDescartes but also the entire Augustinian tradition, the\n\u201cI\u201d is essentially immaterial, a mind or a soul. Similarly,\nhe writes in Primary Truths, \u201cSomething lacking\nextension is required for the substance of bodies, otherwise there\nwould be no source [principium] for the reality of phenomena\nor for true unity\u2026 But since atoms are excluded, what remains is\nsomething lacking extension, analogous to the soul, which they once\ncalled form or species\u201d (A VI iv 1648/AG 34). (Material atoms, as\nadvocated by Democritus in the classical period and by Gassendi and\nothers in the seventeenth century, are excluded, Leibniz thinks,\nbecause they violate PII; that is, two purely material atoms would seem\nto be qualitatively identical and yet distinct, which is impossible if\none accepts PC, PSR, and the derivation of PII.)\n\n\nLeibniz is not as clear as one would like him to be, for at this\npoint in his career it is possible to read him as seeing that something\nis a substance so long as it has a soul or a substantial form,\nwhereas later in his career it seems more clearly to be the case that\nthe only substances are souls or soul-like entities, the\nmonads. In other words, Leibniz can be interpreted as advocating, at\nleast in this period, a kind of Aristotelian hylomorphism, in which\nsubstances are composites of matter and form. This has been the subject\nof debate in the field, but this entry cannot adjudicate the\nmatter. (For more on this dispute, see Look 2010.)\n\n\nNevertheless, in declaring that a substance is necessarily\nindivisible, Leibniz renders it impossible for a body, or\nmatter alone, to be a substance. Thus, Cartesian corporeal\nsubstance, the essence of which is simply extension, cannot exist\nas substance. Put differently, Leibniz's argument is that nothing that\nis divisible is a substance; a Cartesian chunk of matter is divisible;\ntherefore, a Cartesian chunk of matter is not a substance.  This\npoints to the first part of Leibniz's critique of the Cartesianism\nmentioned above: namely, that according to Leibniz, Cartesian matter\nfails to have the unity required of a genuine substance. Indeed, in\nthe Correspondence with Arnauld, Leibniz considers the case of a human\nbody deprived of a soul and says the body, or cadaver, would not be a\nsubstance at all but merely an aggregate of substances. Moreover,\nanything lacking a substantial form or soul is not a substance, that\nis, if a thing is not truly \u201canimated\u201d, then it is only a\ntrue phenomenon. (G II 77/AG 80) It should be noted how strong\nLeibniz's claim is: he is arguing that Cartesian corporeal substances\nor any such chunks of matter are not real beings \u2013 at least not\nas real as simple substances.  Aggregates of simple substances,\ntherefore, have a different ontological status from simple\nsubstances.\n\n\nThe distinction between simple substances and aggregates becomes an\nimportant one in Leibniz's philosophy. To Arnauld, he writes the\nfollowing: \u201cI hold that philosophy cannot be better reestablished\nand reduced to something precise, than by recognizing only substances\nor complete beings endowed with a true unity, together with the\ndifferent states that succeed one another; everything else is only\nphenomena, abstractions, or relations\u201d (G II 101/AG 89). If this\nis the case, then aggregates of simple substances are merely phenomena\nand fail to have the reality of the underlying simples. Further, the\nbodies of natural philosophy, the bodies of the world we observe around\nus, would seem to be in some sense mere phenomena. \n\n\nWhile some scholars of Leibniz's thought have suggested this, it does\nnot get at the full story of Leibniz's metaphysical system.  The\ndistinction that Leibniz draws is one between a real unity and a\nphenomenal unity, or as he also puts it, between a unum per\nse and a unum per aggregationem. Leibniz's favorite\ncomparison in the case of the latter is to a rainbow: bodies, for\nexample, fail to have intrinsic unity, but we do represent them as\nbeing single and unified objects much as we represent a rainbow as\nbeing one thing when it is in fact merely the result of the refraction\nof light through innumerable water droplets. But just as the rainbow\nresults from the presence of genuine unities, the water droplets (to\ncontinue the metaphor, even if this is not true when speaking with\nLeibniz in metaphysical rigor), so do the bodies of the natural world\nresult from the genuine simple substances.  Put differently, the\nsimple substances ground the phenomena of bodies in the\nworld. This relation between the phenomena and the underlying simple\nsubstances is what Leibniz means when he talks about\n\u201cwell-founded phenomena\u201d [phenomena bene\nfundata].  But insofar as the bodies of the natural world are\nwell-founded phenomena \u2013 that is, insofar as they are grounded\nin the simple substances \u2013 they are not simply phenomena as in\nBerkeley's philosophy. (This view is also not uncontroversial.  To\ncompare Leibniz with Berkeley, see the entry on\n Berkeley.)  \n",
