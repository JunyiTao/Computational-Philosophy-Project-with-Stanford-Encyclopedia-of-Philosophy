    "main_text": "Theology || Natural Theology\n3.2 Natural Theology\n\nLike Cleanthes in Hume\u2019s Dialogues, Price holds that\nbelief in a Designer is immediate and irresistible. \u201cThis\nvisible universe \u2026 is self-evidently, an exhibition of\nthe power and wisdom of a powerful and wise cause\u201d (R 285) But\nwhat of his moral qualities? Although in his introduction to the\n\u201cDissertation\u201d, Price claims that a posteriori\narguments also show the Designer to be good, in Chapter X of the\nReview, Price strikes a cautious note. There may be much more\nof good than bad in the works of that Designer, but we might wonder\nwhether that is sufficient grounds for drawing conclusions about the\nDesigner\u2019s moral character. For a malicious being could produce\nhappiness, and perhaps the Designer grants us happiness now only to\nfrustrate our expectations in order to increase our misery later by\ncontrast to our present state. Price himself thinks that, despite such\npossibilities, we are justified in inferring God\u2019s goodness from\nhis creation but accepts that such inferences are open to cavil.\nHowever, as a moral realist, Price does not need to rely on arguments\nfrom the distribution of good and bad things in the world. For if\nbenevolence is, in itself better than malice, justice than injustice,\nand so on, and if an intelligent mind must both recognize and be\nguided by these thoughts, then we can know a priori that God\nis morally perfect.\n\nNevertheless, it is a striking fact that virtue is not always\nproportionately rewarded, nor vice punished. Price is more realistic\non this point than Butler who said \u201cSelf-love then, though\nconfined to the interest of the present world, does in general\nperfectly coincide with virtue\u201d (1729: Sermon 3, para. 8 [2017:\n36]). Not only do the virtuous often suffer and the vicious flourish,\nbut the virtuous are open to peculiar psychological sufferings of\nwhich the vicious know nothing. They may suffer from an over\nscrupulous conscience, from guilt, and consciousness of their own\nunworthiness.\n\n\nIt can scarcely be denied with respect to wickedness, that it would\nvery frequently be much better for a man, (I mean for his own present\nease) to be thoroughly wicked than partially so. (R\n259)\n\n\nSo much is this the case that Price contends\n\n\nthis world appears fitted more to be a school for the\neducation of virtue, than a station of honour to it. (R\n257)\n\n\nWhat may we infer from these rather dismal facts with respect to a\nfuture life? If we are moral sentimentalists, nothing. But if we\naccept moral realism then we know that a wise Designer will also be a\nmorally good one. From this we may conclude that there is some future\nscene of life in which these imbalances between virtue and reward will\nbe rectified. We cannot, however, infer that this future life will be\nendless, for the injustices of this life could be rectified in a\nfinite time.\n\n\nThat we are to be delivered to from death to a new life that shall\nnever end of complete happiness, this is unspeakably\nmore than any arguments from distributive justice can teach us to\nexpect. (R 263)\n\n\nIt is revelation alone that can assure us of God\u2019s graciousness\nin this respect.\n",
