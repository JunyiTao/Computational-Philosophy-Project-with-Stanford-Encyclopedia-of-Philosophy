    "main_text": "Aristotle\u2019s Life\n1. Aristotle\u2019s Life\n\n\n           \nBorn in 384 B.C.E. in the Macedonian region of northeastern Greece in\nthe small city of Stagira (whence the moniker \u2018the\nStagirite\u2019, which one still occasionally encounters in\nAristotelian scholarship), Aristotle was sent to Athens at about the\nage of seventeen to study in Plato\u2019s Academy, then a pre-eminent\nplace of learning in the Greek world. Once in Athens, Aristotle\nremained associated with the Academy until Plato\u2019s death in 347,\nat which time he left for Assos, in Asia Minor, on the northwest coast\nof present-day Turkey. There he continued the philosophical activity\nhe had begun in the Academy, but in all likelihood also began to\nexpand his researches into marine biology. He remained at Assos for\napproximately three years, when, evidently upon the death of his host\nHermeias, a friend and former Academic who had been the ruler of\nAssos, Aristotle moved to the nearby coastal island of Lesbos. There\nhe continued his philosophical and empirical researches for an\nadditional two years, working in conjunction with Theophrastus, a\nnative of Lesbos who was also reported in antiquity to have been\nassociated with Plato\u2019s Academy. While in Lesbos, Aristotle\nmarried Pythias, the niece of Hermeias, with whom he had a daughter,\nalso named Pythias.\n\n\nIn 343, upon the request of Philip, the king of Macedon, Aristotle\nleft Lesbos for Pella, the Macedonian capital, in order to tutor the\nking\u2019s thirteen-year-old son, Alexander\u2014the boy who was\neventually to become Alexander the Great. Although speculation\nconcerning Aristotle\u2019s influence upon the developing Alexander has\nproven irresistible to historians, in fact little concrete is known\nabout their interaction. On the balance, it seems reasonable to\nconclude that some tuition took place, but that it lasted only two or\nthree years, when Alexander was aged from thirteen to fifteen. By\nfifteen, Alexander was apparently already serving as a deputy military\ncommander for his father, a circumstance undermining, if\ninconclusively, the judgment of those historians who conjecture a\nlonger period of tuition. Be that as it may, some suppose that their\nassociation lasted as long as eight years.\n\n\nIt is difficult to rule out that possibility decisively, since little\nis known about the period of Aristotle\u2019s life from\n341\u2013335.  He evidently remained a further five years in Stagira\nor Macedon before returning to Athens for the second and final time,\nin 335. In Athens, Aristotle set up his own school in a public\nexercise area dedicated to the god Apollo Lykeios, whence its name,\nthe Lyceum.  Those affiliated with Aristotle\u2019s school\nlater came to be called Peripatetics, probably because of the\nexistence of an ambulatory (peripatos) on the school\u2019s\nproperty adjacent to the exercise ground.  Members of the Lyceum\nconducted research into a wide range of subjects, all of which were of\ninterest to Aristotle himself: botany, biology, logic, music,\nmathematics, astronomy, medicine, cosmology, physics, the history of\nphilosophy, metaphysics, psychology, ethics, theology, rhetoric,\npolitical history, government and political theory, and the arts. In\nall these areas, the Lyceum collected manuscripts, thereby, according\nto some ancient accounts, assembling the first great library of\nantiquity. \n\n\nDuring this period, Aristotle\u2019s wife, Pythias, died and he\ndeveloped a new relationship with Herpyllis, perhaps like him a native\nof Stagira, though her origins are disputed, as is the question of her\nexact relationship to Aristotle. Some suppose that she was merely his\nslave; others infer from the provisions of Aristotle\u2019s will that\nshe was a freed woman and likely his wife at the time of his\ndeath. In any event, they had children together, including a son,\nNicomachus, named for Aristotle\u2019s father and after whom his\nNicomachean Ethics is presumably named.\n\n\nAfter thirteen years in Athens, Aristotle once again found cause to\nretire from the city, in 323. Probably his departure was\noccasioned by a resurgence of the always-simmering anti-Macedonian\nsentiment in Athens, which was free to come to the boil after Alexander\nsuccumbed to disease in Babylon during that same year. Because of\nhis connections to Macedon, Aristotle reasonably feared for his safety\nand left Athens, remarking, as an oft-repeated ancient tale would tell\nit, that he saw no reason to permit Athens to sin twice against\nphilosophy. He withdrew directly to Chalcis, on Euboea, an island\noff the Attic coast, and died there of natural causes the following\nyear, in\n 322.[3]\n",
