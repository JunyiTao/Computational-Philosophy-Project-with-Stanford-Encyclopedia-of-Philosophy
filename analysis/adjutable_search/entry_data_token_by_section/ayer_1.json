    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || Meaning\n2.1 Meaning\n\n\nThe empiricist basis of Ayer\u2019s attitude to meaning was laid first in\nhis reading of Hume. The thought that no idea had any empirical\nsignificance unless it was suitably related to an impression stayed\nwith him, and was reinforced both by his reading of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus and by the time spent in Vienna with the Logical\nPositivists. His first formulation of a criterion of meaning, the\nprinciple of verification, was in the first edition of LTL\n(1936), where he claimed that all propositions were analytic\n(true in virtue of their meaning) or else either strongly verifiable\nor weakly verifiable. Strong verification required that the truth of a\nproposition be conclusively ascertainable; weak verification required\nonly that an observation statement be deducible from the proposition\ntogether with other, auxiliary, propositions, provided that the\nobservation statement was not deducible from these auxiliaries\nalone. This rapidly proved defective: any proposition P\nconjoined with \u2018if P then O\u2019, where\n\u2018O\u2019 is an observation statement, will yield\nO, without this being deducible from \u2018if P\nthen O\u2019 alone. So in the second edition Ayer amended\nthe principle to read: a statement is directly verifiable if it is\neither an observation statement or is such that an observation\nstatement is derivable from it in conjunction with another observation\nstatement (or observation statements), such derivability not being\npossible from the conjoined observation statement(s) alone. And a\nstatement is indirectly verifiable if, first, in conjunction with\ncertain other premises it entails one or more directly verifiable\nstatements that are not derivable from these other premises alone,\nand, second, that these other premises \u201cdo not include any\nstatement that is not either analytic, or directly verifiable, or\ncapable of being independently established as indirectly\nverifiable.\u201d (LTL 2nd ed. P. 17).\n\n\nThis principle generated further criticism, most significantly from\nAlonzo Church (1949), who claimed to show that, again, it allowed\nany statement to be meaningful. Take O1,\nO2, and O3 as logically\nindependent observation statements, and S any statement\nwhatsoever. Then\n\n\n(1) (\u00acO1&O2) v\n(O3&\u00acS)\n\n\nis directly verifiable, as (1) in conjunction with\nO1 entails O3. S\nbecomes indirectly verifiable, as O2 follows from\nS and (1), and (1) is directly verifiable. Should\nO2 follow from (1) alone, then\nO2 follows from\nO3&\u00acS, which means that\n\u00acS is directly verifiable (O2 and\nO3&\u00acS being logically\nindependent).\n\n\nDespite the failure of these attempts to provide a rigorous empiricist\ncriterion of meaning, Ayer continued to hold that there was a close\nconnection between evidence and meaning, maintaining that a\nsatisfactory account of confirmation was needed before a fool-proof\ncriterion of empirical meaning could be supplied. Given later doubts\nabout whether any theory of confirmation could provide a foundation\nfor a theory of meaning (Quinean doubts relating to the impossibility\nof ruling out any facts as possibly bearing on the truth of any\nsentence), it remains unclear as to how the evidence-meaning\nconnection can be circumscribed. (For a review of other attacks on,\nand adjustments to, the verification principle, see Wright 1986,\n1989.)\nIn addition to the technical difficulties surrounding the proper\nformulation of the meaning-criterion, Ayer later acknowledged that he\nhad been vague as to whether the criterion was intended in a \u2018weak\u2019 or\n\u2018strong\u2019 sense: if weak, verifiability merely demarcated sense from\nnonsense, whilst the strong version meant that the method of\nverification provided the meaning of the sentence. It was the strong\nversion that was used in his discussion of the meaning of sentences\nabout the past and other minds, but in his discussion of the latter\nanother difficulty emerged. It had not been made clear whether the\n\u2018method of verification\u2019 was intended to be neutral between people\nemploying the sentences in question, and so provide a standard meaning\nfor these sentences, or whether such a method could provide an\nidiosyncratic meaning for one individual\u2019s use of the sentence, the\nmethod of verification being peculiar to that person. In his\ndiscussion of mental experiences, Ayer had implicitly taken the second\nroute, and so sentences attributing such experiences to himself were\ngiven a \u2018mentalistic\u2019 analysis, and those attributing experiences to\nothers were given a behaviorist analysis (see the introduction to the\nsecond edition of LTL. At the same time, however, he construed\nanother\u2019s self-attribution of experience mentalistically, whereas, as\nhe later acknowledged, to be consistent these should also have been\ngiven a behaviorist analysis (see the discussion between Bernard Williams and\nAyer in Macdonald 1979).\n\n\nThe strong interpretation of the criterion required there to be some\ndecision made as to what evidence contributed to the meaning of\nverifiable sentences. For Ayer it was clear that not all evidence for\na statement was to be included in the meaning of the statement: a\nstatement about the blood on Jack\u2019s jacket was not included in the\nmeaning of the assertion that Jack was the murderer. Further, although\nonly present evidence is available to anybody making a statement about\nthe past, the meaning of such a statement is not restricted to such\npresent evidence; one is entitled to include in the meaning evidence\nthat would be available if one were able to transport oneself to that\npast time. Moral statements were, in Ayer\u2019s view, not verifiable, and\nso could not be construed as assertions of fact, being interpreted\ninstead as expressions of emotion. This is examined again in Section\n7.\n\n\nThe only class of statements that Ayer allowed to be meaningful\nwithout such a connection to evidence was that comprised of\ntautologies, which included all analytic propositions. These were the\nonly propositions knowable a priori, their meaning being\ndependent on how language was used, and on the conventions governing\nthat use. Ayer insisted that the necessity attaching to these\npropositions was only available once the conventions governing\nlanguage-use were in play.\n",
