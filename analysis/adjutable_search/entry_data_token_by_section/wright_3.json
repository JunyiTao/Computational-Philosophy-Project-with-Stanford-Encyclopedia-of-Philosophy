    "main_text": "Wright's Philosophy of Science || Positivism\n2.3 Positivism\n\nSeveral issues were involved in the view of science as a taxonomy or\ngrammar.  The influential French positivist, Auguste Comte, along with\nscientific positivists like Mach, distrusted theoretical concepts in\nscience because they saw that these concepts rely on elements of\npractical\n experience.[6]\n A prime example was the relation of the concept of gravity to the\nexperience of weight on the surface of the earth. Comte said that\ngravitation is a \u201cgeneral fact\u201d which is itself \u201ca\nmere extension of [a fact] which is perfectly familiar to us, and\nwhich we therefore say that we know; \u2014 the weight of bodies on\nthe surface of the earth\u201d (Comte 28\u201329). Positivists\nbelieved we cannot avoid the anthropomorphic origin of theoretical\nconcepts. It had, however, become clear to positivists who were\nactually engaged in the practice of science that the structure of a\nscience is what sustains prediction, not the meaning\nof the theoretical terms of the science. A system of principles\nconstitutes a logical form of explanation, and the ability of the\nsystem of principles to link disparate phenomena, more than concepts,\nis the truth in science. As a result, descriptions of the\nlogical character of a science come to the fore in discussions of\ntheory.\n\n\nWright's emphasis on verification, his pluralism about induction, and\nhis focus on the logical character of scientific principles together\nshow that he had absorbed important aspects of scientific\npositivism. He often highlighted scientific theory as classificatory\n(PD 363) and emphasized the relating of higher and lower\nlevels of generality as the hallmark of science. He referred to the\npositivists often and to Comte in particular. In a passage that\nparallels Auguste Comte, Wright said that every scientific distinction\nis of value in classification and \u201cmust coincide with and be of\nuse as a sign of other distinctions \u2014 that is, be a mark of the\nthings distinguished by it\u201d (PD\n 370).[7]\n\n\nThis passage points to Wright as a link between Comte's positivism and\nC.S. Peirce, who believed that concepts are indexical signs. Although\nhe had no semiotic theory, Wright's view of scientific discourse as a\ndevice substituting for useless thought made him sensitive to the role\nof signs (PD 280). Wright also identified the objective value\nof science with its use. He meant by this \u201cits relatedness or\nulterior value, whether as leading to other and wider ranges of\nknowledge, or as a discipline of the mind, or even as leading to\n\u2018bread and butter\u2019\u201d (PD 282). Peirce, as is\nwell-known, insisted that the meaning of a concept is its use\nor effect.  In contrast, Wright believed theoretical statements have\nmeaning other than their effects, but the truth of the statements is\njudged by whether predicted effects or results are\nverified.[8]\n\n\nHis own approach to signs is evident in his speculation, undertaken\nat the urging of Darwin, about the origin of self-consciousness. Here\nWright treated concepts as images. He traced the emergence of\nself-consciousness in terms of human awareness of different kinds of\nsigns (usually vocal, he said) that recall images in thought. The\nimages themselves act as signs when a human being reasons, but\n\u201cwith reference to the more vivid outward signs, they are, in the\nanimal mind, merged in the things signified, like stars in the light of\nthe sun\u201d (PD 209). The conscious awareness of the\ndifference between outward and inward signs is crucial to human\nawareness, he believed. This awareness may have come with the\n\u201cconsciousness of simultaneous internal and external\nsuggestion\u201d and the recognition of the outward sign as a\nsubstitute for the inward sign (PD 210). The key to\nrationality is the outward sign itself, i.e., elements of language,\nbeing made the object of attention (PD \n206).[9]\n\nIt is worth noting that, in a letter of 1869, Wright used the term\nconsilience to explain the advantages of positivism over the\n\u201colder\n philosophy.\u201d[10]\n Positivism, he said, is a system of \u201cuniversal methods,\nhypotheses, and principles\u201d founded on the sciences. It is not a\nuniversal science itself but must be \u201ccoextensive with actual\nknowledge, and exhibit the consilience of the sciences\u201d (L,\n141). Consilience was a term used by William Whewell in 1858 to\ndescribe the coherence and mutual consistency of different scientific\ndisciplines as they develop. This coherence, for Whewell, was a test\nof the truth of the\n sciences.[11]\n\nIn summary, Wright's understanding of\nscience and its method are distinguished by (1) his refusal to theorize about sense data\nand his consequent grounding of empiricism in the type of data\navailable to everyday perceiving, (2) his nuanced treatment of\ninduction, which rejects Cartesian starting points, and (3) his\ncombination of verification with methodological realism about theoretical\nentities.\n",
