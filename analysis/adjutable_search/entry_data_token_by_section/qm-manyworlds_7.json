    "main_text": "Correspondence Between the Formalism and Our Experience || FAPP\n3.4 FAPP\n\nThe construction of the quantum state of the Universe in terms of the\nquantum states of objects presented above is only approximate; it is\ngood only for all practical purposes (FAPP). Indeed, the\nconcept of an object itself has no rigorous definition: should a mouse\nthat a cat just swallowed be considered as a part of the cat? The\nconcept of a \u201cdefinite position\u201d is also only\napproximately defined: how far should a cat be displaced for it to be\nconsidered to exist in a different position? If the displacement is\nmuch smaller than the quantum uncertainty, it must be considered to\nexist in the same place, because in this case the quantum state of the\ncat is almost the same and the displacement is undetectable in\nprinciple. But this is only an absolute bound, because our ability to\ndistinguish various locations of the cat is far from this quantum\nlimit. Furthermore, the state of an object (e.g. alive or dead) is\nmeaningful only if the object is considered for a period of time. In\nour construction, however, the quantum state of an object is defined\nat a particular time. In fact, we have to ensure that the quantum\nstate will have the shape of the object not only at that time, but for\nsome period of time. Splitting of the world during this period of time\nis another source of ambiguity because there is no precise definition\nof when the splitting occurs. The time of splitting corresponds to the\ntime of the collapse in the approach given by von Neumann 1955. He\nprovided a very extensive discussion showing that it does not matter\nwhen exactly the collapse occurs, and this analysis shows also that it\ndoes not matter when the splitting in the MWI occurs.\n\nThe reason that it is possible to propose only an approximate\nprescription for the correspondence between the quantum state of the\nUniverse and our experience is essentially the same reason for the\nclaim of Bell 1990 that \u201cordinary quantum mechanics is just fine\nFAPP\u201d. The concepts we use: \u201cobject\u201d,\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d, etc. are not rigorously defined. Bell and\nmany others were looking (until now in vain) for a \u201cprecise\nquantum mechanics\u201d. Since it is not enough for a physical theory\nto be just fine FAPP, a quantum mechanics needs rigorous foundations.\nThe MWI has rigorous foundations for (i), the \u201cphysics\npart\u201d of the theory; only part (ii), corresponding to our\nexperience, is approximate (just fine FAPP). But \u201cjust fine\nFAPP\u201d means that the theory explains our experience for any\npossible experiment, and this is the goal of (ii). See Wallace 2002,\n2010a, 2012 for more arguments why a FAPP definition of a world is\nenough.\n",
