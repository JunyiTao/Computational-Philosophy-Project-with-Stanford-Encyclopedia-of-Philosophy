Dilthey\u2019s ambivalent attitude towards\nHegel can provide some initial clues about his own philosophical\napproach. He admired Hegel\u2019s recognition of the historical\ndimension of philosophical thought, but rejected the speculative and\nmetaphysical ways he developed this relation. Like the Neo-Kantians,\nDilthey proposed a return to the more focused viewpoint of Kant, but\nnot without also taking account of the higher emancipatory aspirations\nand broader perspectives of later thinkers such as Fichte, Herder, and\nHegel.\n\nDilthey characterized his own expansive view of philosophy as one of\nestablishing integral relations to all the theoretical disciplines and\nhistorical practices that attempt to make sense of the world. Instead\nof demarcating the boundaries that set philosophy apart from other\nways of engaging life, Dilthey conceives its critical task as\narticulating the overall structures that define the human spirit in\ngeneral. Relatively early in his career, philosophy is defined as\n\u201can experiential science of spiritual phenomena\u201d that\nseeks to \u201ccognize the laws governing social, intellectual and\nmoral phenomena\u201d (1867/GS.V, 27). Philosophy should aim to\npreserve the scope that idealists such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel\nhad given it, but it must do so by recapturing the Kantian rigor that\nhad been lost and by proceeding empirically.\n\nThese goals, as formulated in the inaugural lecture that Dilthey gave\nin 1867 on assuming his first professorship in Basel, were already\nprefigured in his early journals. Thus in 1859 Dilthey wrote that a\nnew Critique of Reason must proceed on the basis of the psychological\nlaws and impulses from which art, religion and science all derive. All\nintellectual systems are mere crystallizations of more generic\nschemata rooted in life (JD, 80).\n\nThe early Dilthey conceived his goal as a broadening of the critical\nproject that would ground the human sciences as Kant had grounded the\nnatural sciences. His hope then was that the human sciences would be\nable to arrive at lawful explanations just like the natural sciences.\nUp until at least 1887, when he published his Poetics,\nDilthey was confident that inner explanations of human creativity\ncould be arrived at. He himself formulated three laws of the\nimaginative metamorphosis to account for the uplifting effect that\npoets can have on us. Dilthey summarizes them as the laws of\nexclusion, intensification, and completion. Even in ordinary\nexperience images are transformed by excluding what is no longer of\ninterest and intensifying what remains based on our present interests.\nBut what distinguishes poetic imagery is that it is also completed by\nthe overall life-concerns of a powerful psyche. \n\nThrough his efforts to work out a kind of gestaltist\npsychology that could frame this third law of imaginative completion,\nDilthey came to modify some of his basic assumptions. He came to\nrealize that the overall psychic nexus of an individual was not a\nsufficient contextual frame to explain human experience. Our\nexperience can only be understood by describing it as it as a\ncontinuum that is gradually acquired over time. What he calls the\n\u201cacquired psychic nexus\u201d is itself historically embedded\nin a social world. This means that our access to history is much more\ndirect than our access to nature. We feel ourselves as part of history\nwhereas nature has come to increasingly stand apart from us. Although\nDilthey is still willing to accept that objects of outer experience\nare phenomenal, he no longer accepts the Kantian thesis that the\ncontents of inner experience are phenomenal as well. Inner experience\nis reconceived as lived experience (Erlebnis) that is real\nand the time that relates us to history is not merely the ideal form\nthat Kant had exposited for nature. -\n\n\nThis second phase of Dilthey\u2019s thought is characterized by a\nstress on the reality of lived experience and on the immediate\nunderstanding of human life that this makes possible. It is in the\n\u201cIdeas for a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology\u201d of 1894\nthat Dilthey works out his explanation-understanding distinction.\n\u201cWe explain through purely intellectual processes, but we\nunderstand through the cooperation of all the powers of the mind\nactivated by apprehension\u201d (1894/SW.II, 147). The human sciences\nwill henceforth be conceived as primarily concerned with understanding\nthe meaning of human action and interaction. Also central to this\nsecond phase of Dilthey\u2019s thought is the essay \u201cThe Origin\nof Our Belief in the Reality of the External World and Its\nJustification\u201d of 1890. Our initial access to the external world\nis not inferential, but is felt as resistance to the will. The world\nof lived experience is not merely a theoretical representation, but is\ndirectly present to us as embodying values that are relevant to our\npurposes. The stress on feeling and immediacy in this second phase\namounts to a rejection of Hegel\u2019s dialectical approach.\n\nIf the first phase was characterized by a search for inner\nexplanations and the second phase by direct understanding, the third\nphase can be characterized by the need for interpretation. This final\nphase can be said to span the last decade of Dilthey\u2019s life\nuntil his death in 1911. It begins with the realization in the essay\n\u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d of 1900 that the inner\nintelligibility of lived experience does not yet constitute full\nunderstanding. Self-understanding must also be mediated from without.\nThe way we express ourselves, whether in communication or in action,\nis a crucial intermediary in defining ourselves. Understanding can\nonly be reliable if it proceeds through the interpretation of human\nobjectifications. Thus we properly understand ourselves not through\nintrospection but through historical contextualization. It is in this\nlast phase of his thought that Dilthey, who now occupied the chair\nthat Hegel had once held in Berlin, revives his predecessor\u2019s\ntheory of objective spirit as the medium relating us to the past. In\n1906 Dilthey published a seminal work on the young Hegel \u2013\nDie Jugendgeschichte Hegels \u2013 that made use of recently\ndiscovered theological and political fragments. These unknown early\nfragments disclosed Hegel\u2019s historical geniality before it\nbecame constrained by the dialectical systematization that Dilthey had\nalways objected to. Dilthey\u2019s student Herman Nohl was helpful in\ndeciphering some of these fragments and went on to publish them. Nohl\nalso edited a volume of Dilthey\u2019s writings on the history of\nGerman Idealism going back to Kant, Beck and Fichte and leading up to\nsuch contemporaries of Hegel as Schelling, Schleiermacher,\nSchopenhauer and Fries.\n",
