    "main_text": "Features of Criminal Law\n1. Features of Criminal Law\n\n\nThe life of the criminal law begins with criminalization. To\ncriminalize an act-type\u2014call it \\(\\phi\\)ing\u2014is to make it a\ncrime to commit tokens of that type. Many claim that if it is a crime\nto \\(\\phi\\) then \\(\\phi\\)ing is legally wrongful\u2014it is something that,\nin the eyes of the law, ought not to be done (Hart 1994, 27; Gardner\n2007, 239; Tadros 2016, 91). On this view, we are not invited to\ncommit crimes\u2014like murder, or driving uninsured\u2014just as\nlong as we willingly take the prescribed legal consequences. As far as\nthe law is concerned, criminal conduct is to be avoided. This is so\nwhether or not we are willing to take the consequences.\n\n\nIt is possible to imagine a world in which the law gets its\nway\u2014in which people uniformly refrain from criminal conduct.\nObviously enough this is not the world in which we live. Imagine \\(D\\) is\nabout to \\(\\phi\\). If \\(\\phi\\)ing is a crime, reasonable force may\npermissibly be used to prevent \\(D\\) \\(\\phi\\)ing. Police officers and private\npersons alike have powers to arrest \\(D\\), and reasonable force may\npermissibly be used to make arrests effective.\n\n\nThese powers and permissions exist ex ante\u2014prior, that\nis, to the commission of crime. We can add those that exist ex\npost\u2014once crime has been committed. Imagine now that \\(D\\)\nhas \\(\\phi\\)ed. As well as the power to arrest \\(D\\), the criminal law\nconfers a set of investigative powers designed to help generate\nevidence of \\(D\\)\u2019s criminality: these include powers to stop\nand search, to carry out surveillance, and to detain suspects for\nquestioning. If sufficient evidence is produced, and it is in the\npublic interest to do so, \\(D\\) may be charged with a crime. To\nexercise these powers is to impose new duties on \\(D\\)\u2014\\(D\\)\nmust submit to the search, remain in detention, and turn up in court\nwhen required. For \\(D\\) to do otherwise\u2014absent justification or\nexcuse\u2014is itself criminal. So reasonable force can permissibly\nbe used against \\(D\\) if she refuses to co-operate.\n\n\nThe powers and permissions mentioned so far help \\(D\\)\u2019s accusers\nput together their case against \\(D\\). By the time cases reach the courts\nthose accusers are typically state officials (or those to whom the\nstate has delegated official power). Some legal systems do make space\nfor private prosecutions. But such prosecutions can be discontinued or\ntaken over by state officials (and their delegates). Those officials\n(and delegates) can also continue proceedings in the face of private\nopposition, even when the opposition comes from those wronged by \\(D\\). In\nthis way, the state exercises a form of control over criminal\nproceedings that is absent from legal proceedings of other kinds\n(Marshall and Duff 1998).\n\n\nIt may seem from the above that criminal proceedings are tilted\nheavily in favour of the accusing side. But the criminal law also\nconfers rights on the accused that help protect \\(D\\) against her\naccusers (Ashworth and Zedner 2010, 82). These typically include the\nright to be informed of the accusations in question, the right to\nconfidential access to a lawyer, and the privilege against\nself-incrimination. Most important of all, perhaps, is the right to be\ntried before an independent court that respects the presumption of\ninnocence\u2014that requires the prosecution to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that \\(D\\) committed the crime.\n\n\nAt least on paper, the procedural protections on offer in criminal\nproceedings are more robust than those available to the accused in\nlegal proceedings of other kinds. This is explained in large part by\nthe consequences of criminal conviction. If \\(D\\) is found guilty in a\ncriminal court, \\(D\\) gains a criminal record. Depending on the crime,\n\\(D\\) may be disenfranchised, banned from certain professions, refused\nentry to other countries, and declined access to insurance, housing,\nand education (Hoskins 2014; 2016). This is to say nothing of criminal\nsentences themselves. Those sentences are typically punishments: the\nobject of the exercise is that \\(D\\) suffer some harm or deprivation;\n\\(D\\) is to be made worse off than she otherwise would have been. This\nis not to say that suffering or deprivation must be the ultimate end\nof those who punish. That \\(D\\) suffer or lose out may be a means to\nany number of ultimate ends, including deterrence, restoration, or\nrehabilitation. What it cannot be is a mere side-effect. This is one\nthing that distinguishes criminal sentences\u2014at least of the\npunitive kind\u2014from the reparative remedies that are standard\nfare in civil law. Those remedies are designed to benefit\n\\(P\\)\u2014to wipe out losses the plaintiff suffered in virtue of the\ndefendant\u2019s wrong. True, \\(D\\) often loses in the process of\nensuring that \\(P\\) gains. But we can imagine cases in which this is\nnot so: in which an award of damages leaves \\(D\\) no worse off than\n\\(D\\) was before. The award may remain a reparative success. It cannot\nbe anything other than a punitive failure (Boonin 2008, 12\u201317;\nGardner 2013).\n\n\nWe can now see that criminalizing \\(\\phi\\)ing does much more than make\n\\(\\phi\\)ing a legal wrong. It also makes it the case that \\(\\phi\\)ing\ntriggers a set of legal rights, duties, powers, and permissions, the\nexistence of which distinguishes criminal law from the rest of the\nlegal system. Those rights, duties, powers, and permissions are\nconstitutive of a criminal process via which suspected \\(\\phi\\)ing\nturns into arrest, charge, trial, conviction, and\npunishment. Obviously suspicions are sometimes misplaced. Innocent\npeople\u2019s lives are sometimes ruined in consequence. So it is no\nsurprise that the most destructive powers and permissions are\njealously guarded by the criminal law. Trials held in a\nuniversity\u2019s moot court might be meticulously fair to\ndefendants. But a moot court has no power to detain us in advance, to\nrequire us to appear before it, or to sentence us to\nimprisonment. Force used to achieve any of these things would itself\nbe criminal, however proportionate the resulting punishment might\nbe. As this example shows, criminal law is characterised by an\nasymmetry\u2014it bestows powers and permissions on state officials\n(and delegates) which are withheld from private persons, such that the\nlatter are condemned as vigilantes for doing what the former lawfully\ndo (Thorburn 2011a, 92\u201393; Edwards forthcoming). This remains the\ncase\u2014often to the great frustration of victims and their\nsupporters\u2014even if the official response, assuming it comes at\nall, will be woefully inadequate.\n",
