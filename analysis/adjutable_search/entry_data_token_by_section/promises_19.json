    "main_text": "Issues in Promissory Theory || Promissory Reasons\n5.4 Promissory Reasons\n\nAnother set of issues that have been discussed in the literature we\nmight call issues of promissory psychology. These are issues\nconcerning the mental states of promisors and promisees, and the role\nthese play in producing, explaining or justifying promissory\nobligations. The main focus is on promissory reasons.\n\nWhat reasons do promisors have to keep promises? How do these\npromissory come about and how do they function? How strong are they,\nand what, if any, reasons may override them? These are just some of\nthe most common questions in this area, and the literature on them is\nquite large, too large to adequately survey here, so I will just note\nsome important foci. Of particular interest are the answers to these\nquestions provided by Joseph Raz (1975, 1982, 1986, 2012).\n\nRaz proposes a system of practical rationality with two sorts of\nreasons, of first and second order. First order reasons are reason for\nor against courses of action, while second order reasons are reasons\nabout reasons themselves. Exclusionary reasons are second order\nreasons that exclude other, first order reasons. Promises, says Raz,\nproduce (in the promisor) both first order reasons to perform the\npromised act as well as second order exclusionary reasons to bar from\nconsiderations most first order reasons that counsel against keeping\nthe promise.\n\n\nLet us say that a person does A for the reason that\np if and only if he does A because he believes that\np is a reason for him to do A. A person refrains\nfrom doing A for the reason that p if and only if it\nis not the case that he does A for the reason that\np. In other words a person refrains from acting for a reason\nif he does not do the act or does it but not for this reason.\n\u201cRefrains\u201d is used here in an extended sense which does\nnot imply that the agent intentionally avoids acting for the reason. A\nsecond order reason is any reason to act for a reason or to refrain\nfrom acting for a reason. An exclusionary reason is a second order\nreason to refrain from acting for some reason. (Raz 1975: 487)\n\n\nMoreover, on the Razian picture exclusionary reasons are\n\u201ccontent independent\u201d reasons. This is the notion\n(original with Hart [1958, 1982] cited in Sciaraffa 2009) that a\nreason for action is independent of the \u201ccontent\u201d or\n\u201cnature\u201d of the action they implicate:\n\nThere is a vibrant literature, spanning many decades, engaging with\nRaz\u2019s intriguing suggestions. see Sciaraffa (2009) for a survey\nof some of the earlier literature on this. More recent work can be\nfound in McBride (2015), MacMahon (2018), Molina (2019), Murphy\n(2020), Kimel (forthcoming), and others. Much of this work is in legal\ntheory, on the philosophical underpinnings of private law.\n",
