    "main_text": "Teleosemantic Theories || Informational Teleoemantics\n3.1 Informational Teleoemantics\n\nStampe (1977) was one of the first philosophers in modern times to\nsuggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of\nreliable causes. Dretske\u2019s book, Knowledge and the Flow of\nInformation (1981) has also been very influential. The theory\nDretske develops in that book relies primarily on the notion of\ninformation, but he later offers a theory of content that combines\nboth informational and teleological elements (Dretske 1986, 1988,\n1995). He begins with a notion of information-carrying, which he calls\n\u201cindicating\u201d, and suggests that a representation\u2019s\ncontent is what it has the function to \n indicate.[6]\n\n\nDretske (1981) provides the most careful analysis of the indication\nrelation and he often refers back to it in his later work. However,\nthis analysis adverts to background knowledge, which is clearly an\nintentional phenomenon, so it had to be modified in order to serve as\na basis for Dretske\u2019s theory of content. The modified analysis\nruns as follows: an event token of type R indicates that a\nstate of affairs of type C obtains if and only if (i)\nC in fact obtains and (ii) the probability of\nC\u2019s obtaining, given that R is instanced, is\none (assuming that certain background or \u201cchannel\nconditions\u201d \n hold).[7]\n\n\nDretske points out that representation is not equivalent to\nindication. \u201cR indicates C\u201d entails\n\u201cC obtains\u201d, so \u201cmisindication\u201d (or\n\u201cmisinformation\u201d) is impossible. Misrepresentation, by\ncontrast, is clearly possible. So Dretske (1986) suggests that\nrepresentations are states that have the function of\nindicating. The starting idea is this: if something has the function\nof indicating something else then it is supposed to indicate it but,\nsince items don\u2019t always perform their functions, room for error\nhas been made. (The analysis of functions Dretske relies on here\nappears to be an etiological analysis of; see e.g., Dretske 1995,\n7.)\n\nHowever, Dretske (1986) sees a problem with this starting idea. He\nillustrates the problem with the case of ocean-dwelling anaerobic\nbacteria that have tiny magnets (magnetosomes) that are attracted to\nmagnetic north, which serve to direct the bacteria downwards into the\nrelatively oxygen-free sediment on the ocean floor . Plausibly, the\nfunction of the magnetosomes is to direct the bacteria to anaerobic\nconditions. If we \u201cfool\u201d the bacteria by holding a bar\nmagnet nearby and lead the bacteria upward to their death, this looks\nlike a case of natural misrepresentation. We were, in Dretske\u2019s\nwords, looking for \u201cnature\u2019s way of making a\nmistake\u201d and we seem to have found it. The problem, says\nDretske, is that it is indeterminate how we should describe the\nfunction of the magnetosomes. We can plausibly say that they have the\nfunction of indicating the oxygen-free sediment. But we can also\nplausibly say that they have the function of indicating geo-magnetic\nor even local magnetic north. If we say the latter, no\nmisrepresentation has occurred. So Dretske\u2019s interim conclusion\nis that we cannot count this as an unambiguous case of error, on his\ntheory as outlined so far.\n\nA number of distinct problems for teleological theories go under the\nname of \u201cthe functional indeterminacy problem\u201d\n (section 4.1)\n and the magnetosome example can be used to illustrate several of\nthem. However, Dretske\u2019s response to the indeterminacy problem\nthat he raised suggests that his main concern was with what is now\noften called \u201cthe problem of distal content\u201d. His problem,\nthen, is this. Suppose that we have a simple system that has just one\nway of detecting the presence of some feature of the environment. We\nhave just seen a case of this for the anaerobic bacteria have just one\nway of detecting anaerobic conditions (via the local magnetic field).\nIn such a case, if an inner state indicates the distal feature\n(anaerobic conditions) it will also indicate the more proximal feature\n(local magnetic north). Moreover, if there was selection for\nindicating the distal feature, there will also have been selection for\nindicating the more proximal feature (since the inner state indicates\nthe former by indicating the latter). Dretske further points\nout that, even if a creature has several routes by which it can detect\na given distal feature (e.g., even if the bacteria can detect\nanaerobic conditions by means of light sensors as well) there would\nstill be a disjunction of more proximal features that the\nrepresentation could count as representing, since it could still count\nas having the function of indicating the disjunction of more proximal\nfeatures (i.e., local magnetic north or reduced light).\n\nWhile we might be perfectly willing to allow that the magnetosomes in\nanaerobic bacteria do not represent or misrepresent, the problem of\ndistal content generalizes. When you see a chair across the room as a\nchair across the room, you represent it as a solid 3D object at a\ndistance from you and not as a stream of light reflected from it or as\na pattern of firings in your retinas. Otherwise you would not try to\nwalk to the chair and sit on it. An informational theory of content\nmust therefore explain how mental representations represent distal\nfeatures of the world, as opposed to the more proximal items that\ncarry information about those distal features to the representational\nsystems.\n\nDretske (1986) therefore modifies his proposal and maintains that a\ncreature that is capable of representing determinate content must be\ncapable of learning any number of new epistemic routes to the same\ndistal feature. In that case, he says, there is no closed disjunction\nof more proximal stimuli that the representation could count as\nrepresenting. He speaks of conditioning in this context. The relevant\nrepresentation is recruited by conditioning to indicate the distal\nfeature rather than the disjunction of more proximal features, because\nthere is no finite time-invariant disjunction of more proximal stimuli\nthat it has the function of indicating. However, it is controversial\nwhether the presence of such a learning mechanism would, in fact,\nsolve the distality problem (for discussion, cf. Loewer 1987 and the\nexchange between Garson 2019b and Schulte 2022).\n\nThe claim that misrepresentation is impossible without learning anyway\nseems problematic, since it appears to preclude representations\nproduced by innate input systems, such as innate sensory-perceptual\nsystems. Some psychologists also claim that some core concepts are\ninnate (e.g., see Carey 2009). Later, Dretske (1988) appears to drop\nhis conditioning requirement as a general requirement for\n(determinate) content, although he still maintains that instrumental\nconditioning or other forms of learning are necessary for acquiring\nthe kind of content that can explain \n behavior.[8]\n This re-raises the question of how representations produced by innate\ninput analyzers can have distal content.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the problem of distal content, Dretske\u2019s account\nalso faces a number of other difficulties. Some arise from his strict\ndefinition of information and the notion of \u201cchannel\nconditions\u201d (Fodor 1990c), others from the notion of a function\nto indicate/to carry information (Millikan 2004, ch. 6).\n\nDespite these problems, however, Dretske\u2019s central insight seems\nimportant and appealing. It is plausible that sensory-perceptual\nsystems have the function to produce representations that carry\ninformation and that this bears on their content. An alternative\nattempt to elaborate this insight is sketched later\n (section 3.4).\n",
