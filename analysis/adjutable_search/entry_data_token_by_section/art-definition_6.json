Conventionalist definitions have\nbeen strongly influenced by the emergence, in the twentieth century,\nof artworks that seem to differ radically from all previous\nartworks. Avant-garde works like Marcel Duchamp\u2019s\n\u201cready-mades\u201d \u2013 ordinary unaltered objects like\nsnow-shovels (In Advance of the Broken Arm) and \nbottle-racks \u2013 conceptual works like Robert Barry\u2019s All the things I know\nbut of which I am not at the moment thinking \u2013 1:36 PM; June 15,\n1969, and John Cage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033, have seemed to\nmany philosophers to lack or even, somehow, repudiate, the traditional\nproperties of art: intended aesthetic interest, artifactuality, even\nperceivability. Conventionalist definitions have also been strongly\ninfluenced by the work of a number of historically-minded\nphilosophers, who have documented the rise and development of modern\nideas of the fine arts, the individual arts, the work of art, and the\naesthetic (Kristeller, Shiner, Carroll, Goehr, Kivy).\n\n\nConventionalist definitions come in two varieties, institutional and\nhistorical. Institutionalist conventionalism, or institutionalism, a\nsynchronic view, typically hold that to be a work of art is to be an\nartifact of a kind created, by an artist, to be presented to an\nartworld public (Dickie 1984). Historical conventionalism, a\ndiachronic view, holds that artworks necessarily stand in an\nart-historical relation to some set of earlier artworks.\n",
