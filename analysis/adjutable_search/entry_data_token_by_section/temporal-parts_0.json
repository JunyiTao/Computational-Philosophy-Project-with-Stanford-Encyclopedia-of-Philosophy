    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nYou\u2019re performing an amazing trick right now: you\u2019re in\ntwo places at once. How do you manage to be down there, near the\nfloor, and yet also be a metre or two up in the air? Well, it\u2019s\nnot so very amazing: your feet are down there on the floor, and your\nhead is up in the air. Having spatial parts enables you to be in\nseveral different places, and to have different properties in\ndifferent places: you\u2019re cold down there on the tiled floor, and\nalso warm up there by the heater, because your feet are cold and your\nhead is warm. Moreover, having parts could let you be in the same\nplace as someone else: if you shared a hand with a conjoined\n(\u2018Siamese\u2019) twin, then you could both wear the same glove\nwithout jostling for space.\n\nNone of this is special to people: inanimate objects also extend\nthrough space by having spatial parts. They have different properties\nin different places, and sometimes they overlap by sharing their\nparts. These simple facts about spatial parts explain basic features\nabout the way things and people occupy space.\n\nThings and people take up time as well as taking up space: you existed\nyesterday, and, unless reading this article is a real strain, you will\nexist tomorrow too. Just as you can have different properties at\ndifferent places (hot up here, cold down there), you can have\ndifferent properties at different times (yesterday you hadn\u2019t\nheard of temporal parts, by tomorrow you\u2019ll know plenty about\nthem).\u00a0\n\nSome philosophers believe that you take up time by having different\ntemporal parts at different times. Your spatial parts are things like\nyour head, your feet and your nose; your temporal parts are things\nlike you-yesterday, you-today and you-tomorrow. If you have different\ntemporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different\ntimes, and it would also explain how you can have different properties\nat different times (you-yesterday hasn\u2019t heard of temporal\nparts, you-tomorrow is an expert). According to these philosophers,\nthen, persisting through time is pretty much like extending through\nspace: it\u2019s all a matter of parts.\n\nOther philosophers reject this picture. They argue that you persist\nthrough time as a whole: it\u2019s not just a part of you sitting in\nfront of the computer right now, it\u2019s you, the whole you! It was\nthe very same whole person yesterday who knew nothing about temporal\nparts, and, by tomorrow, the very same whole person will be an expert.\n\u2018You-yesterday\u2019 isn\u2019t a name for some mysterious\npart of you which only existed for a day; instead, it\u2019s a\nstilted way of talking about you, and what you were like\nyesterday.\n\nDiscussions of time, space, identity and change have been part of\nphilosophy since its earliest days, and not every question about\npersistence obviously concerns temporal parts. For example, can we\ngive criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or\npeople? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by\none? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of\nthem? In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it\nhas proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts,\nbecause the answers that philosophers give to these questions can\noften depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.\n\nThis article is divided into a number of sections. Section 2 looks\nmore closely at what exactly temporal parts are supposed to be, and at\nwhat sorts of things are supposed to have them. Sections\n 3,\n 4 and\n 5\n look at a range of arguments in favour of believing in temporal\nparts, and at the responses of those who reject temporal parts.\n Section 6\n discusses connections between debate about temporal parts, and debate\nabout the nature of time more generally.\n Section 7\n considers whether physics can teach us anything about temporal parts.\n Section 8\n discusses a question internal to temporal-parts theories: what\nrelationship is there between the different temporal parts of a single\nobject?\u00a0 Finally,\n section 9\n touches on special concerns about the persistence of people through\ntime.\n",
