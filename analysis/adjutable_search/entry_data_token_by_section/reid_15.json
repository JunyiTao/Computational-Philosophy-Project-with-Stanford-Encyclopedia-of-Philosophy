    "main_text": "Causation and Free Will || The Three Arguments for Moral Liberty\n4.4 The Three Arguments for Moral Liberty\n\n\nReid does not rest content to defend the claim that human beings are\nthe efficient causes of their own behavior by responding to the best\nobjections to it; he also provides three positive arguments for the\nclaim which he labels the \u2018first\u2019, \u2018second\u2019 and \u2018third argument for\nmoral liberty\u2019. (The arguments appear in Essays on the Active\nPowers 4.6\u20138.)\n\n\nThe first argument for moral liberty parallels Reid's response to\nexternal world skepticism (see 3.5 Responding to\nSkepticism about the External World, above). Reid claims that the\nbelief that we are endowed with power to produce our own actions is a\nfirst principle and then employs his general form of defense of first\nprinciples in order to argue that it must be so. We naturally and\nnon-inferentially believe ourselves to be endowed with power since\nvarious activities in which we engage would make no sense if we did\nnot believe ourselves to be endowed with power. For instance, he\nclaims that the activity of deliberating, of weighing reasons for and\nagainst various possible actions, proceeds under the assumption that\nwe have power; if we didn't believe that, he thinks, then we would not\nbother deliberating.\n\n\nWhat gives Reid's claim appeal is the fact that when we deliberate we\nthink that what we are deliberating about is up to us, and for Reid,\nwhat is up to us is identical to what is in our power. However, it's\nnot clear that we have to think of actions as being in our power in\norder to be motivated to deliberate; the thought that our actions are\n\u2018up to us\u2019, a thought which is undeniably involved in deliberation,\nmight be understood in some way which does not presuppose power. For\ninstance, in thinking that what we do is \u2018up to us\u2019, we might just be\nthinking that if we're sufficiently motivated to do it, we will. By\nway of example, note that it's generally true that people who\ndeliberate before they act do things that are more in their interests\nthan those who simply act impulsively, without deliberation. Hence, if\nyou are motivated to avoid impulsive action, that motive might lead\nyou to deliberate, and your deliberation might, in turn, lead you to\ndo something better than you would have done had you not\ndeliberated. It is not clear that a person who was motivated to\ndeliberate for this reason would be presuming himself or herself to be\nendowed with power in Reid's sense. Such a person might think merely\nthat deliberation will produce motives that happen to give rise, for\nreasons entirely out of the agent's control, to better actions. In\nshort, if we think of deliberation as motivated action, and if we can\nimagine a person being motivated to engage in it even in the absence\nof the belief that he or she is endowed with power, then Reid is\nwrong.\n\n\nStill, it is quite possible that Reid is right. The question turns on\nwhether or not it is possible to provide an adequate picture of the\npsychology of deliberation without appeal to the belief that we are\nendowed with power. What the first argument from moral liberty serves\nto do is not to silence the opposition, but instead to force the\nopposition not to oversimplify the phenomena. Those who deny that\nhuman beings are endowed with power in Reid's sense need to explain\nwhat we are thinking when we deliberate. That explanation must not\ngloss over the complexity of ordinary deliberation, but also must not\nshow us to be thinking ourselves to be endowed with power in Reid's\nsense whenever we deliberate about what to do (see Yaffe 2004,\nch. 1).\n\n\nIn the second argument for moral liberty, Reid claims that none of our\nmoral practices\u2014our practices of holding ourselves and others\naccountable for their behavior\u2014would make any sense if we did\nnot believe ourselves and others to be endowed with power over\nconduct. He claims, in short, that the very concept of a morally\naccountable being presupposes that that being has power over his\nconduct. Since we are, he thinks, morally accountable beings, it\nfollows that we are endowed with power over our conduct.\n\n\nThe first argument for moral liberty depends upon the inadequacy of\nany account of deliberation that leaves out the belief that our\nconduct is in our power. So the second depends upon the inadequacy of\nany account of what makes a person morally accountable that does not\ninclude the power to control action. Someone who wished to deny that\nhuman beings have power over their conduct, but are still morally\naccountable, might note, for instance, that one of the primary\npurposes of certain forms of punishment, most notably imprisonment, is\nto prevent the offender from acting similarly in the future. However,\nsuch a purpose does not presuppose that the person has power over his\nor her conduct. If the thief is going to steal again, then that's\nreason enough to imprison him, we might say. This is so even if he is\ngoing to steal only because his desires will inevitably give rise to\nsuch behavior and not because he has power that he is resolved to\nexercise objectionably in the future. Reid's second argument for moral\nliberty fails if purposes of this sort exhaust the purposes of\npunishment. The second argument turns, that is, on a retributivist\nconception of punishment\u2014a conception according to which a\npunishment is appropriate only if it is deserved\u2014and a\nfurther claim to the effect that a punishment is never deserved in the\nretributivist's sense if the crime was not efficiently caused by the\nagent to whom the punishment is issued. It remains an open question\nwhether or not a retributivist conception of punishment could be\ncoherently married to a view that denies that human beings are endowed\nwith power. Reid's second argument for moral liberty raises this\nquestion in a powerful form.\n\n\nIn the third argument for moral liberty, which is the most obscure of\nthe three, Reid claims that a person could not engage in planned\nconduct if not endowed with power. Since it's obvious, he thinks, that\nwe do engage in planned conduct, it follows that we must have power\nover our actions. Reid links the third argument for moral liberty with\nthe argument from design for God's existence. According to the\nargument from design, God must exist since the world is so complex,\nand yet so orderly, that there must have been an all-powerful,\nall-knowing being who designed it and made it according to\nplan. Similarly, Reid argues, planned conduct is at once so\ncomplicated and so orderly that there must have been some author of\nit. He then claims that since it is obvious that we think up our own\nplans, we must also execute them. So, he thinks, we must be endowed\nwith power (see Hatcher 2013).\n\n\nThere is room to object not just to the third argument, but also to\nthe argument from design, by noting that ordered complexity can arise\nthrough mechanisms other than a guiding hand. Most of us think, for\ninstance, that the mechanisms of natural selection result in the\nproduction of enormously complicated and yet ordered biological\nstructures, like the human eye. If natural selection is causally\nresponsible for the human eye, then there is no designer of these\nstructures who efficiently caused them. We don't need power, in Reid's\nsense, in order to execute our plans; we just need to be the sorts of\ncreatures whose minds are hooked up to their bodies in such a way that\nthey do what they plan. It could be, that is, that by forming plans we\nengage powers that are not our own by engaging laws linking plans with\nexecution, laws of which we are not the authors.\n\n\nThis is a powerful objection, but it is not the end of the\ndebate. Notice that someone who rejects the argument from design is\nlikely to think both that there is no efficient cause of the complex\norder which we encounter in nature, and that nobody planned\nthe order that we find. But there is no doubt that when a person, say,\nbuilds a house that there was somebody who formed the plan to build\nthe house. The question is whether or not that person must have had\nthe power to build it in order to bring the plan to fruition. Reid's\npoint is that our attribution of the wisdom to form the plan goes\nhand-in-hand with the attribution of the power to execute it. We might\nthink that nobody was either wise enough or powerful enough to create\nthe world; but if we do think someone was wise enough, then we must\nalso think that person powerful enough. In the case of planned\nconduct, we know that there is a person wise enough\u2014namely the\nperson whose plan it was\u2014so surely we must also think that\nperson powerful enough. As he puts the point:\nEvery indication of wisdom, taken from the effect, is\nequally an indication of power to execute what wisdom planned. And, if\nwe have any evidence that the wisdom which formed the plan is in the\nman, we have the very same evidence, that the power which executed it\nis in him also. (EAP 4.8, 241)\n\n\nEven this point\u2014that where there's wisdom there's\npower\u2014can be questioned, but there is surely something right\nabout it. Traits of character, of which wisdom is an example, are both\ncognitive and volitional: we think of a person who has one as both\ncapable of understanding things, and of doing them. To be wise isn't\njust to know how to do something, but also to be able to do it. So,\nwhen we ascribe someone with the intelligence to think up a complex\nplan, and on those grounds take the person to be wise, we are also\ntaking the person to have the power to execute the plan. This is the\nidea that drives Reid's third argument for moral liberty.\n\n\nNone of Reid's arguments for moral liberty are decisive. Each,\nhowever, lays bare a manner in which the notion of power is naturally\nconstrued to be implicated in our ordinary beliefs and our ordinary\npractices. While it remains possible that what is implicated is\nactually something less, something that can be described and explained\nwithout appeal to Reid's very strong notion of power, Reid's arguments\nnonetheless make clear what an account of human agency that does\nwithout power would need to account for if it is to be\nsatisfactory.
