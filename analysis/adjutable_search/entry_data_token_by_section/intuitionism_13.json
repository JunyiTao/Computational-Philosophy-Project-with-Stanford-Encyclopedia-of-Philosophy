Meta-mathematics\n\nAlthough Brouwer developed his mathematics in a precise and\nfundamental way, formalization in the sense as we know it today was\nonly carried out later by others. Indeed, according to Brouwer\u2019s\nview that mathematics unfolds itself internally, formalization,\nalthough not unacceptable, is unnecessary. Others after him thought\notherwise, and the formalization of intuitionistic mathematics and the\nstudy of its meta-mathematical properties, in particular of arithmetic\nand analysis, have attracted many researchers. The formalization of\nintuitionistic logic on which all formalizations are based has already\nbeen treated above. \n",
