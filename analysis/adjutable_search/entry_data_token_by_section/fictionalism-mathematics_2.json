    "main_text": "The Argument For Fictionalism || Premise (2) and Deflationary-Truth Nominalism\n1.3 Premise (2) and Deflationary-Truth Nominalism\n\nDeflationary-truth nominalism is the view that (a) as platonists and\nfictionalists maintain, ordinary mathematical sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 should be read at face value, i.e., as being of the\nform \u2018Fa\u2019 and hence as making claims\nabout mathematical objects, and (b) there are no such things as\nmathematical objects, but (c) our mathematical sentences are still\ntrue. Views of this kind have been endorsed by Azzouni (1994, 2004,\n2010) and Bueno (2005, 2009). It should be noted, however, that\nBueno\u2014in his (2009)\u2014calls his version of\ndeflationary-truth nominalism a version of fictionalism. This\nisn\u2019t because he really endorses the view that\u2019s being\ncalled fictionalism in this essay; it\u2019s because he uses the term\n\u2018fictionalism\u2019 differently from the way in which\nit\u2019s being used in this essay. But it\u2019s important to note\nthat Bueno\u2019s usage isn\u2019t that different; for as\nwe are about to see, deflationary-truth nominalism and fictionalism\n(as it\u2019s being defined here) are fairly similar views.\n(Bueno\u2019s view also differs from the fictionalist view defined\nhere in a second way: he endorses agnosticism about abstract\nobjects rather than full-blown anti-realism. But this difference is\neven less important than the first one; if we rephrased (b) and (c) in\nthe above definition of fictionalism so that they were consistent with\nagnosticism, virtually nothing else about the fictionalist view would\nhave to change. So fictionalists can choose whether they want to be\nagnostic or anti-realist about abstract objects, and this decision\nwon\u2019t have a very big impact on the rest of their view. Indeed,\nas will become clear in section 3, Bueno\u2019s agnosticism might be\nmore or less equivalent to the views of certain fictionalists.)\n\nBefore describing the problems with deflationary-truth nominalism,\nit\u2019s important to note that the central claim behind that view\nis an empirical hypothesis about ordinary discourse. In particular,\nit\u2019s a claim about the meaning of the term \u2018true\u2019,\nor about the concept of truth. When deflationary-truth nominalists say\nthat, e.g., \u20183 is prime\u2019 could be true even if there were\nno such thing as the number 3, they are making a claim about the\nordinary concept of truth. They are saying that that concept applies\nin certain situations that most of us\u2014platonists and\nfictionalists and just about everyone else\u2014think it\ndoesn\u2019t apply in. If deflationary-truth nominalists try\nto deny that they are making a claim about the ordinary\nconcept of truth, then their view will collapse into a version of\nfictionalism. For since they agree with fictionalists that \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 purports to be about a certain abstract object, and since\nthey also agree that there are no such things as abstract objects, it\nfollows that if they endorsed a standard view of truth\u2014i.e., a\nplatonist-fictionalist view according to which a sentence of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019 could not be true unless\n\u2018a\u2019 referred to an actually existing\nobject\u2014then they would have to admit that \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 is untrue. Now, they might go on to argue that these\nsentences are true*\u2014where this is defined in such a way\nthat sentences of the form \u2018Fa\u2019 can be\ntrue* even if there is no such thing as a\u2014but, of\ncourse, fictionalists would agree with this. So if\ndeflationary-truth nominalism is to be genuinely distinct from\nfictionalism, it has to involve a thesis about the meaning of the\nordinary word \u2018true\u2019; in particular, the claim has to be\nthat sentences of the form \u2018Fa\u2019 can be\ntrue, in the ordinary sense of the term, even if the singular\nterm \u2018a\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to any actually\nexisting object.\n\nGiven this, most fictionalists would probably say that the problem\nwith deflationary-truth nominalism is that it\u2019s empirically\nimplausible. In other words, the objection would be that\ndeflationary-truth nominalism flies badly in the face of our\nintuitions about the meaning of \u2018true\u2019. And there does\nseem to be some justification for this claim. For instance, it just\nseems intuitively obvious that the sentence \u2018Mars is a\nplanet\u2019 could not be literally true unless there really existed\nsuch a thing as Mars. Moreover, intuitively, the sentence \u2018Mars\nis a planet, but it doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 seems like a\ncontradiction, and this intuition seems to be incompatible with\ndeflationary-truth nominalism. If this is right\u2014if the\ndeflationary-truth semantic thesis runs counter to our semantic\nintuitions\u2014then this provides strong evidence for thinking\nit\u2019s false.\n\nBut there is also a second problem with deflationary-truth nominalism:\nit\u2019s supposed to provide us with a way of avoiding platonism,\nbut in fact, it doesn\u2019t. Prima facie, it might seem\nthat deflationary-truth nominalism does deliver a way of avoiding\nplatonism, because the argument for platonism might seem to rely upon\npremise (2) above\u2014i.e., it might seem to rely upon the\nanti-deflationary-truth claim that if sentences like \u20184 is\neven\u2019 should be read at face value, i.e., as being of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019, and if these sentence are\nliterally true, then we are committed to believing in the objects that\nthey\u2019re about, e.g., the number 4. But, in fact, platonists can\nformulate their argument so that it doesn\u2019t rely upon this\nanti-deflationary-truth premise. To bring this point out, let\u2019s\nbegin by introducing two new terms of\nart\u2014\u2018true1\u2019 and\n\u2018true2\u2019\u2014and stipulating that\n\u2018true1\u2019 is to be taken as expressing the\nplatonist-fictionalist concept of truth, so that a sentence of the\nform \u2018Fa\u2019 cannot be true1\nunless \u2018a\u2019 refers to an actually existing object,\nwhereas \u2018true2\u2019 expresses a deflationary\nconcept of truth, so that a sentence of the form\n\u2018Fa\u2019 can be true2 even if\n\u2018a\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to any actually existing\nobject. Given this, platonists can say the following: \n\nWe just don\u2019t care whether the word \u2018true\u2019, as\nit\u2019s used in ordinary English, expresses truth1 or\ntruth2 (or whether it\u2019s ambiguous and sometimes\nexpresses the one concept and sometimes the other). We acknowledge\nthat standard formulations of the argument for platonism involve\nclaims to the effect that ordinary mathematical sentences like\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 are true. But we could just as\neasily base our argument on the claim that sentences like this are\ntrue1. In doing this, we wouldn\u2019t weaken our argument\nin any way. For the arguments we use to motivate the truth of\nmathematics\u2014most notably, the Quine-Putnam indispensability\nargument discussed below\u2014are already arguments for the\ntruth1 of mathematics. And this shouldn\u2019t be\nsurprising; for when we say that ordinary mathematical\nsentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are true, what we\nmean is that they\u2019re true1; so, of course,\nthe arguments that we give for the truth of mathematics are already\nsupposed to be arguments for the truth1 of mathematics.\n\n\nGiven that platonists can proceed in this way, it seems that the\nquestion of whether the deflationary-truth semantic thesis is\nright\u2014i.e., the question of whether the English word\n\u2018true\u2019 expresses the concept of truth1 or\ntruth2\u2014is simply a red herring. The real question is\nwhether platonists have any good arguments for the truth1\nof mathematics (and, of course, whether anti-platonists have any good\narguments against the truth1 of mathematics). In\nother words, if we assume that premises (1) and (4) are true, so that\nwe have to read our mathematical claims as being about (or at least\npurporting to be about) abstract objects, then the real question is\nwhether there are any good reasons for choosing between platonism and\nfictionalism.\n",
