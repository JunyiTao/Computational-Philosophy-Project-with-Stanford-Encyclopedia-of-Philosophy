    "main_text": "Awareness and Access\n1. Awareness and Access\n\nIn an essay on Descartes, the British philosopher H.A. Prichard said\nthat,\n\nWhen we know something, we either do or can directly know that we are\nknowing it, and when we believe something we know or can know that we\nare believing and not knowing it, and in view of the former fact, we\nknow that in certain instances of its use our intelligence is not\ndefective\u2026 (Prichard 1950, 94)\n\n\nPrichard also characterized the point in terms of knowing by\nreflection:\n\n\u2026if there is to be such a thing as knowing that we know\nsomething, that knowing can be attained only directly, we in knowing\nthe thing knowing directly, either at the same time or on reflection,\nthat we are knowing it. (Ibid.)\n\n\nKnowing by reflection is knowledge one achieves merely by thinking\nabout the matter at hand. Further, even if one reflects a good deal,\nPrichard holds that the knowing thereby achieved is direct knowing,\npresumably because one need make no inferences from one belief to\nanother in the activity of reflecting.\n\nPrichard is here endorsing the KK-thesis, i.e., the thesis that\nknowing implies knowing that one knows. Philosophers who endorse what\nwe can call knowledge internalism accept something akin to what\nPrichard endorses, though their main focus is slightly different. That\nis, knowledge internalism concerns not knowing that one knows, as in\nPrichard, but rather knowing or being aware of that on the basis of\nwhich one knows. For example, imagine that you know that a flock of\nCanada geese has landed in a neighborhood park in your city; and\nsuppose that you came by this piece of knowledge on the basis of and\nas a result of some testimony from another person who has just\nreturned from that park. Then knowledge internalism would be the view\nthat in knowing that the geese are in the park, one also knows or is\naware of that on the basis of which one knows, namely, one is aware of\nthe testimony on the basis of which one has knowledge of the geese.\nOr, more plausibly, one could become aware merely by reflection of\nthat on the basis of which one knows about the geese.\n\nWe can use the term \u2018knowledge basis\u2019 for that on the\nbasis of which one knows something. A knowledge basis as here\nunderstood need not be restricted to other pieces of knowledge or\nbeliefs, but could also include experiences a person has had. Using\nthis terminology, we could say that knowledge internalism is the\nthesis that a person either is aware or can be become aware of the\nknowledge basis for each item of knowledge that person may have.\n\nIt is clear that when one is aware of the knowledge basis, or when one\ncan become aware of the knowledge basis, that one thereby has a kind\nof access to the knowledge basis. Accessibility, it is often said, is\nthe core idea behind internalism, and it is also usually supposed that\nthe sort of accessibility one has is pretty much what Prichard spoke\nof, namely a kind of direct awareness that one actually engages in or\ncould engage in merely by reflection. Using these ideas we can\ncharacterize two different forms of access knowledge internalism.\n\nActual Access KI:\nOne knows some proposition p only if one is also aware of\none's knowledge basis for p.\nAccessibility KI:\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection of one's knowledge basis for p.\n\n\nHere we assume that the awareness spoken of in Actual Access knowledge\ninternalism is the direct sort that Prichard had in mind. It is an\nawareness that is not brought about by any calculation or\nreasoning.\n\nTo illustrate and partly defend Actual Access knowledge internalism,\nimagine that you look at a tree in the park, and thereby come to know\nthat there is a tree there. We can suppose for these illustrative\npurposes that your knowledge basis is the visual experience of the\ntree, and thus that you acquire direct, non-inferential knowledge of\nthe presence of the tree. In this example, when you acquire that\nknowledge, it seems plausible to also think that you are aware that\nyou are engaged in seeing, and that the content of the visual event is\na tree. Moreover, this same sort of point will hold for all manner of\neasily acquired perceptual knowledge, including that acquired by other\nsense modalities. So, for a very wide range of cases all involving, we\nare supposing, non-inferential perceptual knowledge acquisition,\nactual access will be quite plausible. In those cases it seems right\nto think that you are aware of the knowledge basis, the specific\nperceptual experience and its content, in which you engage when the\nknowledge is first secured.\n\nEven so, Actual Access knowledge internalism is not plausible when\ntaken in full generality, for these perceptual cases make up only a\nsmall portion of one's knowledge. We need only notice that most of\none's knowledge is stored knowledge, that is, knowledge one gained at\nan earlier time and has since retained. Imagine that a person knows\nthat Illinois was Abraham Lincoln's home state. She acquired this\nknowledge years before, while in elementary school, and has retained\nit ever since. It is most implausible to think that she is now aware\nof her knowledge basis for this knowledge about Lincoln, and this in\ntwo important senses. First, it is hardly likely that she is now aware\nof her original knowledge basis, whatever that may have been back in\nelementary school. Also, second, it is most likely that she has no\ncurrent awareness of her present knowledge basis, presumably something\nto do with ongoing stable memory. Of course, some people will have\nsuch awareness, but we should not let this fact lead us to the\nconclusion that every person with this knowledge of Lincoln's home\nstate will be aware of the workings of memory. We should, thus, reject\nActual Access knowledge internalism as implausible.\n",
