    "main_text": "Revisiting Classical Philosophical Questions || Reductionism and the Sum of the Parts\n4.1 Reductionism and the Sum of the Parts\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, proponents of systems biology often\nexplicitly define their approach in contrast to reductionist\nstrategies in molecular biology. Molecular biology is depicted as a\nfield studying molecular components and pathways in isolation, whereas\nsystems biology integrates the pieces of the puzzle in the context of\nthe system as a whole (van Regenmortel 2004; Keller 2005; Kitano\n2002a,b). The contrast between molecular biology and systems biology\nis often overstated, and much of systems biology research is also\nfocused on specific molecular difference-makers (De Backer et al.\n2010; Gross 2017; O\u2019Malley & Dupr\u00e9 2005). However,\nsystems biology may give a novel interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\ndictum that the whole is more than the sum of the parts by\nspecifying what more means in the context of contemporary\nbiology.\n4.1.1. Modular and Bottom-Up Reductionism\n\nWhen systems biologists criticize reduction in molecular biology, the\nissue at stake is typically the limitations of studying biological\nparts or modules in isolation. Because the target of the criticism\noften differs from the more traditional philosophical focus on\nreduction of higher-level to lower-level explanations (Brigandt &\nLove 2017), systems biologists can be said to oppose what has been\ntermed modular reductionism (Gross & Green 2017). An\nanti-reductionist stance towards modular reductionism needs not reject\nthe idea that living systems can be modelled and explained bottom\nup. For instance, while global approaches within these fields\nreject the modularity assumption, some keep the focus on genomes and\nmolecular networks as the primary determinants of biological functions\n(O\u2019Malley et al.\n 2008).[7]\n\nMany systems biologists have, however, also argued against reduction\nof higher-level models and explanations, and there is an ongoing\ndebate about how far genomics, proteomics, etc. will take us in\nsolving complex problems like understanding cancer (cf.,\nBarab\u00e1si et al. 2011; Hood et al. 2015). Similarly, researchers\ninvolved in projects aiming to simulate multiscale structures like the\nhuman heart emphasize the need to include macroscale parameters as\nthey provide functionally important constraints on the behavior of\nmicroscale processes (Bassingthwaighte et al. 2009; Kohl & Noble\n2009). An interesting reframing of Aristotle\u2019s dictum in this\ndiscussion is that living systems at the same time are more\nand less than the sum of the parts (see Hofmeyr 2017; Noble\n2012). In other words, the system as a whole constrains the degree of\nfreedom of lower-level parts and provides a functional organization of\nthese that are required for some system capacities (see below).\n\nGiven the increasing emphasis on comprehensive multiscale models,\nsystems biology research may have a unique potential for philosophical\ninsights considering the explanatory role of macroscale properties and\ntop-down effects. Systems biologists for instance point to how enzyme\nactivity is constrained by the chemical environment and the cellular\ncontext (Hofmeyr 2017), or how the biophysical properties of muscle\nfibers and cell membranes provide functional constraints on ionic\noscillations central to the generation of heart rhythms (Noble 2012).\nInterpreting top-down effects as constraining relations may exemplify\nwhat philosophers of science have called \u2018medium downward\ncausation\u2019 (Emmeche et al. 2000), which interprets downward\ncausation as boundary conditions. Noble (2012) explicitly endorses\nsuch a view when arguing that downward causation is necessary by\npointing out how equations describing the kinetics of ion channels in\ncardiac modeling cannot be solved without defining the boundary\nconditions (e.g., the cell voltage). Multi-scale modeling may thus\nhelp to give a more concrete mathematical reinterpretation of the\ncontroversial notion of downwards causation (see also Ellis et al.\n2011; Green 2018). Moreover, discussions of downward causation in\nsystems biology have practical as well as theoretical implications,\ne.g., for experimental design in cancer research on studies of cancer\nas a genetic or tissue-based disease (Bertolaso 2011; Soto et al.\n2008; see also\n Section 5.3).\n4.1.2 Emergence and Predictability\n\nDiscussions of downward causation are often connected to debates about\nwhether biological systems exhibit emergent properties (cf.,\nAlberghina & Westerhoff 2005; Boogerd et al. 2005, 2007; Kolodkin\net al. 2011). Emergence in the context of systems biology typically\nmeans that systems properties cannot be explained from\u00a0the\nproperties of parts. Discussions can center on epistemic questions\nabout whether systems properties can be predicted from analyses of\nlower-level constituents (epistemological emergence) to debates on\nwhether multilevel systems are fundamentally irreducible (ontological\nemergence).\n\nSome systems biologists are optimistic that current limitations in the\npredictive capacity of models can be overcome by increasing the\ncomplexity\u00a0of computational models, thus presenting a epistemic\ndeparture from the methodological principle of Ockham\u2019s razor\n(Kolodkin & Westerhoff 2011). Others stress that biological\ncomplexity forces life scientists to draw on abstract and idealized\nmodels (Hofmeyr 2017; Gross 2017; 2019). These debates center on\nfundamental questions about how far biological research can be taken\nby integrating more parameters and data points (Kolodkin et al. 2012),\nand how far we can \u2018extend ourselves\u2019 through\ncomputational approaches (Humphreys 2004; Vermeulen 2011). But they\nalso concern ontological questions about whether there are principled\nlimitations to our ability to predict and control living systems\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d (Bassingthwaighte et al. 2009; Green 2018;\nNoble 2012; Moreno and Su\u00e1rez 2020). Large-scale modeling\nprojects such as the Virtual Cell, the Physiome Project, and\nthe Virtual Physiological Human offer exciting cases for\nphilosophical analysis of the prospects and challenges associated with\nparameterizing and validating complex models (Carusi et al. 2012;\nCarusi 2014; Hunter et al. 2013). Ultimately, such projects may push\nthe boundaries for prediction and control in the life science, or may\nreveal deeper challenges of biological complexity.\n4.2 Explanatory Pluralism\n\nSystems biology also brings new insights to discussions of scientific\nexplanation. In particular, network analysis in systems biology have\nfurther sparked discussion about the roles of mathematical\nabstractions to identify organizational features, counterfactual\ndependencies, and generalizable aspects of biological systems. The\nintegration of different disciplinary inputs and emphasis on\nmathematical modeling make systems biology a particularly interesting\ncase for discussions of whether the mechanistic account can fully\ncapture the diversity of explanatory practices in contemporary\nbiology.\n\nMechanistic accounts initially emphasized the differences between the\nexplanatory ideal of covering laws in physics and explanations in\nmolecular biology (Craver & Tabery 2015). Mechanistic explanations\ncite how biological functions arise from the interactions and\norganization of component parts or entities (Bechtel & Richardson\n1993; Machamer et al. 2000; Glennan 2002). Since research in systems\nbiology is often integrated with research in molecular and cell\nbiology, some have argued that many cases in systems biology can\nreadily be seen as an extension of mechanistic research (Boogerd et\nal. 2013; Richardson & Stephan 2007). But although abstract\nmodeling is compatible with mechanistic research, it is a contested\nissue whether abstract models are developed towards research aims that\nare distinct from mechanistic explanations. While some contend that\nmathematical models are primarily used as inputs to or heuristics for\nmechanistic explanations, i.e., as mechanistic schemas (Darden 2002;\nMatthiessen 2015), others interpret the emphasis on quantitative and\ndynamic aspects as a departure from mechanistic explanations. One\nargument in support of the latter is that the modeling process does\nnot proceed from abstract to more detailed models, but in the opposite\ndirection, suggesting that mechanistic details may be vehicles for\nmore generic explanations rather than the other way around (Braillard\n2010; Serban & Green 2020). A second argument refers to the\ndifficulty of reconstructing a causal story from the abstract\nmathematical models (Issad & Malaterre 2015). Systems biology may\ntherefore also offer cases of non-mechanistic explanations.\n\nTopological or structural explanations emphasize how\nnetworks architectures generically determine dynamic behaviors,\nindependently of the causal details of the network (Huneman 2010;\nKosti\u0107 2020; Kosti\u0107 et al. 2020; Su\u00e1rez &\nDeulofeu 2019). Mathematical analysis of network structures underlying\nbiological robustness has been argued to exemplify this explanatory\ngoal (Jones 2014). Another type of non-mechanistic explanations is\nwhat Wouters (2007) calls design explanations, first outlined\nin the context of comparative physiology. Design explanations do not\ndescribe how a biological function is causally produced but instead\nclarify why a given design (and not an alternative design) is present.\nThey do so by pointing to constraints on the possible designs that\nmake some designs good, some suboptimal, and others impossible. The\nrelevance of design explanations for systems biology lies in the\ninterest to specify relations between functional capacities (e.g.,\nrobustness) and system organization (e.g., integral feedback control)\nvia design principles that are independent of specific contexts of\nimplementation (Braillard 2010; Boogerd 2017, see also Shinar &\nFeinberg 2011 for a candidate example from systems biology). Design\nexplanations highlight explanatory features similar to what Batterman\nand Rice (2014) call minimal model explanations (see also\nGross 2015). These explanatory accounts have been interpreted as\nvarieties of constraint-based explanations (Green and Jones\n2016), because they prioritize physical and formal constraints at the\nexpense of mechanistic details. Aside from highlighting differences in\nthe epistemic aims of explanation, some accounts also provide an\nontological justification for different explanatory\nstrategies, i.e., that higher-level phenomena are characterized by a\nfunctional loss of and autonomy from mechanistic details at lower\nlevels (Batterman and Green 2021; Moreno and Su\u00e1rez 2020).\n\nAnother approach is to consider explanations in systems biology as\nmergers of different types of explanations. Some accounts highlight\nthe compatibility of different explanatory aims as ingredients in a\npluralistic approach to biological explanation (Brigandt et al. 2018;\nMekios 2015). One way to clarify the compatibility is that different\napproaches highlight constitutive or causal aspects\n(Fagan 2015). Distinguishing between these can possibly help identify\nthe distinct contributions of causal mechanistic modeling and\nmathematical analysis of network dynamics. Whereas causal relations\nare often prioritized in mechanistic accounts, Fagan (2015) suggests a\njoint account of collaborative explanations that combine\ndescriptions of the spatial organization and the causal relations in\nthe system. The increasing reliance on formal modeling in systems\nbiology also call for an examination of the relation between\nmathematical and mechanistic explanations (Baker\n2005; Brigandt 2013; Mekios 2015). Some have argued that an updated\naccount of dynamic mechanistic explanations is required,\nhighlighting the importance of mathematical and computational modeling\nfor understanding non-linear dynamics, cyclic organization, and\ncomplex feedback relations (Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2011, 2012;\nBrigandt 2013). In this context, idealized models are important for\nunderstanding the organization of mechanisms within a larger network\nstructure (Bechtel 2015b; Levy & Bechtel 2013; van Eck &\nWright\n 2021).[8]\n\nAlthough much, or perhaps most, of the philosophical work on systems\nbiology has focused on explanation, one cannot assume that explanation\nis the sole aim of systems biology research (MacLeod & Nersessian\n2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b). Design principle may not only explain how\nbiological functions are realized but also allow for explorations of\nwhether the same function could be realized in other or simpler ways\n(Briat et al. 2016). Thus, synthetic and systems biology also call for\nphilosophers to examine other epistemic aims, such as prediction,\ncontrol, and design, and well as theoretical and practical interests\nin understanding the minimal requirements for biological functions and\nlife itself.\n5. Social and Societal Implications\n5.1 Interdisciplinary Integration, Collaboration and Education\n\nLarge-scale interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly\nhighlighted as a necessary requirement for addressing the grand\nchallenges of modern science and society (Vermeulen 2010; Calvert\n2010; Andersen 2016). Interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of systems and\nsynthetic biology, and both approaches offer rich sources for\nphilosophical analysis of the epistemic features of interdisciplinary\nintegration (O\u2019Malley & Soyer 2012), interdisciplinary\nidentities (Calvert 2012), and of large-scale collaboration across\ndifferent universities (Calvert & Frow 2015; for examples of\nlarge-scale projects see the list of internet resources below).\n\nStudying the prospects and challenges of interdisciplinary integration\nalso offers a window to the cognitive processes involved in\ninterdisciplinary problem-solving, where research cannot rely on a\nsingle theoretical framework (MacLeod & Nersessian 2013a,b).\nThrough this process, different epistemic ideals operating in\ncontemporary science often become apparent. While combining different\nconceptual frameworks can lead to innovation and scientific progress,\nthe existence of different epistemic cultures can also pose challenges\nfor interdisciplinary collaboration (Calvert & Fujimura 2011;\nCarusi 2011; Kastenhofer 2007). Philosophical analysis has been\nproposed to help facilitate collaboration in situations where\nepistemic standards clash. Philosophy of science can help explicate\nthe differences and the backgrounds for these, and uncover\n\u2018blind spots\u2019 considering the aims, values, constraints,\nand challenges of other disciplines (Nersessian 2017).\n\nOne divide that is commonly highlighted is the gap between\nexperimental biologists and modelers with a background in engineering,\nmathematics, or physics. Empirical analyses of collaborations between\nmodelers and experimentalists in systems biology show that these two\ngroups often have different views on what kinds of data and models are\nmost relevant (Joaquium et al. 2019; Nersessian 2017; Rowbottom 2011).\nFor instance, modelers may not be interested in studying biological\nsystems at the same level of detail as experimental biologists, and\nexperimentalists may find highly abstract and idealized models\ninspired by physics or engineering misleading (MacLeod 2018). From the\nperspective of engineers or physicists, the preoccupation with\nmolecular details involves a risk of missing out on dynamic patterns\nthat could be captured with more generic models, while\nexperimentalists may find that such generic models often lack\nspecificity or merely reproduce current biological knowledge. These\ndifferences may in part be grounded in different explanatory standards\nas also discussed in Section 4.2 (Fagan 2016; Green et al. 2015a).\n\nMaking explanatory standards and values more explicit, and clarifying\nthe relative prospects and limitations of different research\nstrategies, are ways in which philosophy of science could contribute\nto science and science education. At the same time, collaborative\npractices in synthetic and systems biology may call for an extension\nof the scope of philosophical analysis. Whereas philosophers\ntraditionally have focused on logical and argumentative relations in\nscientific texts, understanding collaborative practices in systems and\nsynthetic biology may further require the exploration of the\naesthetic, cognitive, and creative dimensions of scientific practice\n(Carusi 2011; Ginsberg et al. 2015). Important questions are which\naspects underlie choices of visualization strategies, and how the\nrepresentation of biological data through diagrams, heat maps, network\nmodels, or state spaces influence biological reasoning and\ncollaboration (Abrahamsen & Bechtel 2015; Carusi 2012; Jones &\nWolkenhauer 2012).\n5.2 Biology in the Digital Age\n\nThe emergence of systems biology and synthetic biology in the 21th\ncentury is to a large extent driven by the development of techniques\nand strategies for producing, digitalizing, collecting, disseminating,\nand standardizing data. A first step in these research practices is\noften to consult online databases or bio-ontologies that are used for\ndata sharing, data integration, annotation, and curation of\nexperimental datasets (Leonelli 2016). For instance, the search for\nnetwork motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n started with the development of network models based on data\ndownloaded from the database RegulonDB as well as other sources\n(Shen-Orr et al. 2002). Numerous databases, bio-ontologies, and\nsoftware tools have been developed, emphasizing the ideals of Open\nData and large-scale collaborative efforts (Leonelli 2013). These\npractices raise questions as to whether some projects within systems\nand synthetic biology may be described as \u2018big science\u2019\n(Vermeulen 2010), and about the epistemic and social implications of\ndata-intensive research practices and collaborations.\n\nOne debated issue is the extent to which big data will radically\nchange or even revolutionize scientific methods, shifting the focus\nfrom hypothesis-driven inquiry to data-driven discoveries (Mazzocchi\n2015). Whereas some have seen data-intensive strategies as a\ntheory-free approach (Allen 2001), others have argued that\ntheory\u00a0plays different, although not less important, roles in\ndata-intensive science (Leonelli 2016). In particular, big data\nbiology presents new opportunities for eliminative inferences and\nexploratory experiments (Ratti 2015). Moreover, since the aim of\nbio-ontologies is to provide a standardized language and repository\nfor shared information, choices concerning vocabulary and\ncategorizations become important philosophical topics, including\nwhether standardization is compatible with local data uses (Leonelli\n2016). Important philosophical questions include how choices\nconcerning collection, sampling, standardization, visualization, and\ninterpretation of data affect the result of the analysis.\nSpecifically, the results of correlation-based methods such as GWAS\nare sensitive to sampling procedures and specific statistical\nthresholds, and the clinical validity and utility of genetic\nbiomarkers is a debated issue (e.g., Hey 2015; Maher 2008; McPherson\nand Tybjaerg-Hansen 2016).\n\nFinally, data-intensive practices also have implications for the\ninstitutional organization of science, as exemplified by the push for\nopen access on one hand and commercial interests in big data on the\nother (Calvert & Frow 2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b; Leonelli 2013,\n2014; Royal Society 2012; Vermeulen 2011). Data are often produced and\ncompiled without specific aims in mind and are used and reused for\nmultiple purposes, and scholars have stressed the need to reconsider\nthe relation between data and evidence, and between basic and applied\nscience. Moreover, as contexts for ownership of data change, also\nreward-systems in terms of authorship and credits may need to be\nreconsidered (Ankeny & Leonelli 2015).\n5.3 Applications and Ethical Issues\n\nSystems biology and synthetic biology are expected to help address\nsocietal challenges with payoffs for biomedical research, health care,\nand environmental resource management. While offering new exciting\npotentials, concerns have also been raised about the social and\nethical implications of the new techno-scientific strategies.\n\nSystems medicine, the medical application of systems biology, aims for\nmajor breakthroughs towards understanding of complex diseases such as\ncancer and heart conditions (Voit & Brigham 2008; Wolkenhauer et\nal. 2013). Ambitious projects within systems biology such as the\nVirtual Physiological Human raise intriguing questions about\nhow computational modeling will influence future biomedical research\n(Kohl & Noble 2009; Kolodkin et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2013).\nMulti-scale cardiac models are already being developed with important\nimplications for the potential to address physiological variability,\nand for philosophical discussions of model validation and the relation\nbetween experiment and simulation (Carusi et al. 2012; Carusi\n2014).\n\nDevelopments in systems and synthetic biology have encouraged\nphilosophers to revisit traditional conceptions of disease as\ndysfunctional states (Holm 2013, 2014), or broken mechanisms (Gross\n2011). Rather than focusing on the function or dysfunction of specific\ngenes or molecular mechanisms, network approaches to disease may\nsuggest a more dynamic approach to disease that accounts for an\nincreasing number of integrated processes (Del Sol et al. 2010; Huang\net al. 2009). Cancer research is a major priority of systems biology\nresearch, and exemplifies a field where data-intensive approaches may\nbe needed to address biological complexity (Plutynski 2021).\nDevelopments in cancer genomics have revealed an astonishing diversity\nof tumor types, suggesting that finer-grained disease-categories and\nmore targeted treatments may be needed. This line of research has\nopened new research venues, such as the development of multi-action\nremedies targeting numerous disease-related pathways identified via\ngenomic analysis. The discovered diversity of mutations identified in\nsequenced tumors has, however, also led to heated debates on whether\nthe behavior and identity of cancer cells can fully be understood at\nthe molecular level. Some have stressed the need to move beyond\ngene-centric or cell-centric approaches and to consider cancer as a\nproblem of tissue-organization (Soto & Sonnenschein 2011).\nAlthough some systems biological explanations of cancer illustrate the\npossibility of integrating \u201ctop-down\u201d and\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches (Bertolaso 2016; Plutynski and\nBertolaso 2018), systems biology research also displays a variety and\nsometimes conflicting approaches to cancer. These debates not only\nhave philosophical implications for discussions about reductionism but\nalso\u00a0practical implications for how cancer should be approached\nexperimentally and treated in clinical practice (Bertolaso 2011; Soto\net al. 2008).\n\nOne of the important problems in contemporary medicine is how to\naccount for patient-specific variation. Systems medicine is sometimes\nhighlighted as a route to personalized or precision medicine (Hood et\nal. 2015). The aim to personalize medicine is as old as the medical\nprofession itself, but it is now promoted through data-intensive\ncomputational strategies with exciting new potentials (Tutton 2014).\nProponents are optimistic that large-scale modeling of\npatient-specific data can result in a paradigm-shift from a\none-size-fits-all model in traditional medicine, toward a more\nefficient systemic approach that can tailor disease prevention,\ndiagnosis, and treatment to individual patients. Against this\noptimism, some have raised concerns about uncertainties and potential\nharmful results associated with genetic risk profiling, including the\nrisk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary medicalization of healthy\nindividuals (Green & Vogt 2016; Vogt et al. 2016, 2019).\nPhilosophers and social scientists have also critically examined how\nrisk information is communicated to the public by companies\ncapitalizing on personalized genomics, and discussed how such\ninformation may affect health outcomes and perceptions of health\n(Bartol 2013; Prainsack 2017; Reydon et al. 2012). More generally,\nsystems medicine has spurred debates about whether the vision to\npredict and control future health outcomes is compatible with a\nhumanistic approach to medicine and social complexity (Tutton 2014;\nVogt et al. 2014). Moreover, combination of systems medicine and\nsynthetic biology applications opens also for what O\u2019Malley\n(2011a) termed constructive personalized medicine, where\npredictive modeling and synthetic interventions are combined.\nPromising technologies for these purposes now include CRISPR-Cas9 gene\nediting, organ-on-chip models, 3D bioprinting and organoid-based\nmodels for replacement therapies. While creating unprecedented\npotentials for disease treatment, they also raise ethical questions\nabout artificial chimerism and human enhancement (Pio-Lopez 2021).\n\nIn the context of synthetic biology, discussions often center on\nwhether the attempt to create synthetic organisms and the use of\ndesign metaphors can compromise our perspective on and respect for\nlife (Christiansen 2016a; Douglas et al. 2013; McLeod and Nerlich\n2017). Other ethical debates consider the risk of negative\nconsequences of specific synthetic applications. Discussions often\ninvolve so-called dual-use problems where the benefits of genetically\nmodified organisms are weighted against potential problems and risks.\nExamples are biohazards associated with intentional or unintentional\nrelease of synthetic pathogens, or the possibility that synthetic\nproduction of biomedical compounds opens for efficient and inexpensive\nproduction of illegal drugs (Christiansen 2016b). Concerns have also\nbeen raised about the commercialization of biotechnologies. Examples\nare applications of broad patents concerning minimal genomes or\nsynthetic genes (O\u2019Malley et al. 2008), and considerations about\nstructural injustice if industrial production via synthetic organisms\noutcompete conventional farming in developing countries (Christiansen\n2016b). Thus, the strong push to address societal problems through\nsystems and synthetic biology gives rise to new exciting possibilities\nbut also calls for critical examination from philosophers and social\nscientists.\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nSystems and synthetic biology are often described as distinguishable\nin their emphasis on analysis versus synthesis, but the ties to\nengineering approaches are complex and multi-faceted in both fields.\nSystems and synthetic biology have been addressed together in this\nentry because many scientific and philosophical issues overlap. Both\napproaches draw inspiration from engineering, mathematics, physics,\nand computer science, but in various different ways and towards the\ndifferent aims of understanding, predicting, and modifying biological\nsystems. Accordingly, both approaches provide excellent sources for\nphilosophical discussions of interdisciplinary integration,\nparticularly the implications of the increasing embedding of\nmathematical and computational approaches in biology. Some practices\nencourage philosophers to revisit classical philosophical topics such\nas reductionism and scientific explanation, but systems and synthetic\nbiology also broaden the scope of philosophical topics to include\ndata-intensive practices and modeling strategies towards the aims of\ndesign and control.\n\nSince this entry has examined the philosophical implications of both\nsystems biology and synthetic biology, much attention has been given\nto the implications of engineering approaches, including the quest for\nso-called design principles. It is, however, important to note that\nsystems biology and synthetic biology cover a broad spectrum of\nresearch practices, some of which are more strongly inspired by\nchemistry or physics than engineering. This entry should thus be taken\nas an attempt to only cover some ground of the vast philosophical\nlandscape that these research fields reach into. With the rapid\ndevelopment of both approaches and their explicit aim to address grand\nscientific and societal challenges, exciting times lie ahead for\nphilosophy of biology.",
