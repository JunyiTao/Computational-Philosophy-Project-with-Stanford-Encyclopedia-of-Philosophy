Defining the Emotions: What are the Desiderata?\n\nTwo broad desiderata have governed the project of defining emotions in\nboth philosophy and affective science: (a) Achieving compatibility\nwith ordinary linguistic usage, and (b) Achieving theoretical\nfruitfulness. A definition that aims exclusively at (a) is a\ndescriptive definition. A definition that aims at (b) at the\ncost of possibly violating some ordinary intuitions is\nprescriptive. To secure ordinary language compatibility,\ntraditional philosophers have relied on introspection, thought\nexperiments, casual observation, gleaning of insights from literary\ntexts and other artistic sources, and more recently, experimental\ntests of ordinary intuitions and of the psychological processes\nunderlying them performed within \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d.\n\nScientists have also been interested in the study of folk emotion\nconcepts, and they have applied to them experimental techniques common\nin the psychology of concepts. These techniques have revealed that\nemotion concepts, like most ordinary concepts, are prototypically\norganized (Fehr & Russell 1984). There are better and worse\nexamples of emotions as ordinarily understood (e.g., fear is a better\nexample of emotion than awe) and there are borderline cases, such as\nboredom: on those, ordinary language users are split as to whether\nthey qualify as emotions. A variety of psychological structures have\nbeen proposed by concept theorists to account for membership in folk\nemotion categories, including similarity to prototypes, exemplars,\nperceptual symbols and others (Fehr & Russell 1984; Wilson-Mendenhall et al.\n2011).\n\nWhat philosophers and affective scientists aim to offer are\nprescriptive definitions of emotions that preserve as much ordinary\nlanguage compatibility as it is compatible with serving\ninterest-dependent theoretical objectives. One reason why\ntheoreticians are not merely interested in outlining the contours of\nfolk emotion concepts through descriptive definitions is that they\nsuspect that such concepts may include widely diverse items that are\nnot amenable to any robust theoretical generalizations.\n\nAt first blush, the things we ordinarily call emotions differ from one\nanother along several dimensions. For example, some emotions are\noccurrences (e.g., panic), and others are dispositions (e.g.,\nhostility); some are short-lived (e.g., anger) and others are\nlong-lived (e.g., grief); some involve primitive cognitive processing\n(e.g., fear of a suddenly looming object), and others involve\nsophisticated cognitive processing (e.g., fear of losing a chess\nmatch); some are conscious (e.g., disgust about an insect in the\nmouth) and others are unconscious (e.g., unconscious fear of failing\nin life); some have prototypical facial expressions (e.g., surprise)\nand others lack them (e.g., regret). Some involve strong motivations\nto act (e.g., rage) and others do not (e.g., sadness). Some are\npresent across species (e.g., fear) and others are exclusively human\n(e.g., schadenfreude). And so on.\n\nThis multi-dimensional heterogeneity has led some to conclude that\nfolk emotion categories do not designate natural kinds, either with\nrespect to the generic category of emotion (Rorty 1980b, 2003; Griffiths 1997;\nRussell 2003; Zachar 2006; Kagan 2007, 2010) or with respect to\nspecific emotion categories such as anger, fear, happiness, disgust,\nand so on (Scarantino 2012; Barrett 2006, 2017). Others have\nargued that there is, nevertheless, enough homogeneity among instances\nof folk emotion categories to allow them to qualify as natural kinds\n(e.g., Charland 2002; Prinz 2004; Zinck & Newen 2008).\n\nThe concept of a natural kind is itself contentious and\nprobably more suitable for discussing the categories affective\nscientists are interested in, so we will speak of theoretical\nkinds instead, understood as groupings of entities that\nparticipate in a body of philosophically or scientifically interesting\ngeneralizations due to some set of properties they have in common.\n\n\nWhether folk emotion categories are homogeneous enough to qualify as\ntheoretical kinds has important methodological implications. To the\nextent that they are, the prescriptive definitions of emotions the\ntheorist offers can achieve both theoretical fruitfulness and maximal\ncompatibility with ordinary linguistic usage (in such case,\nprescriptive definitions will also be descriptively adequate). To the\nextent that they are not homogeneous enough, prescriptive definitions\nwill have to explicate folk emotion categories, transforming\nthem so as to increase theoretical fruitfulness while giving up on\nsome degree of ordinary language compatibility (Carnap 1950). \n\nTheoretical fruitfulness, however, is conceived differently by\nphilosophers and affective scientists. The former often have as their\nprimary target making sense of the human experience of emotions and\nsometimes to contribute to other projects in philosophy, such as\nexplaining the origins of rational action or moral judgment, or\nshedding light on what makes life worth living, or investigating the\nnature of self-knowledge. Affective scientists, by contrast, are more\nlikely to favor a third-person approach that may be highly revisionary\nwith respect to our first-person self-understanding. And their\nprescriptive definitions are often designed to promote measurement and\nexperimentation for the purposes of prediction and explanation in a\nspecific scientific discipline. \n\nIn this entry, we will assess philosophical and scientific definitions\nof emotions in terms of both ordinary language compatibility and\ntheoretical fruitfulness, but acknowledge that the field currently\nlacks clear guidelines for how to strike a proper balance between\nthese two desiderata.\n",
