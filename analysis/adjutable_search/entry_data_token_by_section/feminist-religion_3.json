    "main_text": "The Problem of God || Feminist Critique of Traditional Theism\n3.1 Feminist Critique of Traditional Theism\n\nPhilosophers of religion have sometimes marked a distinction between\nthe anthropomorphic language of myth and popular piety, on the one\nhand, and the conceptual and abstract categories of philosophy, on the\nother hand, as though when we repair to the metalevel of analysis we\nleave gender-inflected language behind. Feminist philosophy of\nreligion points to all the ways the signifier \u201cGod\u201d\nremains stubbornly gendered male in Western thought and subliminally\nenvisioned as a male personage. Whether taken as real or unreal,\ninferred validly or invalidly, said to be experienced directly or only\nprojected illusorily, the divine identity in classical theism and\natheism is unmistakably male. This supreme, ruling, judging, and\nloving male God is envisioned as a single, absolute subject, is named\nFather, and is conceived as standing in a relation of hierarchical\ndominion over the world. In ways both implicit and explicit, this\nconstruct tends in turn to justify various social and political\nstructures of patriarchy which exalt solitary human patriarchs at the\nhead of pyramids of power. Drawn almost exclusively from the world of\nruling class men, traditional theistic concepts and images legitimate\nsocial and intellectual structures that grant a theomorphic character\nto men who rule and relegate women, children, and other men to\nmarginalized and subordinated areas. The discursive practices that\nhave constructed the divine as male are intimately connected to the\nproduction of ideologies which devalue all that is not male; they have\nformed a constitutive element in the oppression of women and other\n\u201cOthers\u201d.\n\nThe dominance of male signifiers for deity is only part of the problem\nof classical theism. Like a prism which refracts all the surrounding\nlight, the gendering of God has skewed the way in which other problems\nin philosophy of religion have been traditionally constructed. The\nproblem of religious language, for example, is frequently\ncast in terms of the meaning and use of metaphors and models,\ninvolving questions of reference and truth. But the metaphors and\nmodels employed by mainstream philosophers of religion often trade\nuncritically on intrinsically hierarchical patterns of relations.\nMetaphors such as father, king, lord, bridegroom, husband and\nGod-\u201cHe\u201d go unmarked. If an occasional female model or\nmetaphor intrudes into this homosocial circle, it is immediately\nre-marked upon. Introducing female pronouns for God-\u201cshe\u201d\nproduces nervous laughter in most classrooms.\n\nIn the study of the so-called divine attributes, none has\nreceived more discussion in the literature than\n\u201comnipotence\u201d, defined as some version of \u201cperfect\npower\u201d. Both the conceptualization of the nature of this power\nas well as descriptions of its effects embody sexism and androsexism.\nIn twentieth century studies, the standard definition of perfect\npower ranged from \u201cunilateral power to effect any\nconceivable state of affairs\u201d to the more moderate notion of\n\u201cself-limiting power\u201d. But the kind of power in question\nwas in principle one of domination, or power-over, as it has been\npersistently associated with the characteristics of ideal masculinity.\nIn the eleventh century, Peter Damian could quote approvingly the\nbiblical passage \u201cO Lord, King Omnipotent, all things are placed\nin your power, and there is no one who is able to resist your\nwill\u201d, as he argued, contra St. Jerome, that divine\nomnipotence is even able to \u201ccause a virgin to be restored after\nshe has fallen\u201d (1065 [1969: 143). Like the two favorite heroes\nof modern philosophy, the Cartesian cognitive subject and the Kantian\nautonomous will, an omnipotent deity reflects the mirror image of\nidealized masculinist qualities, according to feminist philosophers of\nreligion.  Among contemporary schools, only process philosophers of\nreligion have explicitly argued against the attribute of omnipotence\non the grounds that it is conceptually incoherent, scientifically\nsuperfluous, and morally offensive in its association of the divine\nwith male controlling power (see, for example, Cobb & Griffin\n1976; Suchocki 1988; Howell 1988).\n\nPhilosophical arguments on behalf of the concept of divine\naseity or self-sufficiency reinforce the characteristic\ndisparagement of reciprocal power relations found in other social and\nintellectual expressions of patriarchy. Divine existence is said to be\ncompletely self-sufficient and sovereign. It is what it is\nindependently of any and all creatures, and its relations to these\nothers are external relations only. But, according to feminist\ncritics, in the absence of internal or constitutive relations that\nwould affect or qualify the divine aseity, real relatedness to\ncreatures is ruled out and a one-sided glorification of impassivity\nover change regulates the model of God and the world.\n\nIn a related way, the topic of theodicy has also been deeply\nshaped by male-defined constructions of power and interest. The very\nform of the question, How can an all-powerful deity permit evil?\nimplies a meaning of \u201call-powerful\u201d that is embedded in a\ndiscourse of domination. At the same time, the meaning of\n\u201call-good\u201d, called into question by the power of evil, is\ndefended by traditional theodicies in ways that either equivocate on\nthe meaning of \u201cgoodness\u201d or cast doubt on the moral\nattributes of the deity. Also exemplary are the types of evil simply\noverlooked in the many hypotheticals, counterexamples, and possible\nworlds that are generated in discussions of theodicy by male\nphilosophers. Misogyny and rape rarely make the list of evils. The\nwhole drift of theodicy as an intellectual exercise gravitates back to\nthe question of God, and rarely to the world of cruelty and suffering\n(Thie 1994; for exceptions, see Farley 1990, and Sands 1994).\n\nPhilosophical debates on the topic of immortality have also\nbeen deeply shaped by androcentric interests\u2014centering on\nself-perpetuation and individual, rather than collective, survival.\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, arguably a foremother in feminist philosophy\nof religion, located an important gender difference in His\nReligion and Hers (1923). \u201cDeath-based\u201d religion, she\nclaimed, asks the question, \u201cWhat is going to happen to me,\nafter I am dead?\u201d\u2014a posthumous egoism. To this she\njuxtaposed a \u201cbirth-based\u201d religion whose main question is\n\u201cWhat is to be done for the child who is born?\u201d\u2014an\nimmediate altruism. Many contemporary feminist philosophers of\nreligion would find Gilman\u2019s anthropology overly simple but her\nemphasis suggestive.\n\nA still deeper critique involves the differentiation of embedded\nlevels of bias and androcentrism in the crucial assumptions, methods,\nand norms of traditional philosophy of religion. Rooted in an ancient\ndualistic worldview whose philosophical inadequacy has been harder to\ndetect until recently than its social and legalistic inequities,\nWestern religious categories have been inextricably bound up with a\ncertain metaphysical exigency. The metaphysical worldview that once\nsupported the sacred canopy may have lost much of its cogency for the\nmodern mind, along with the arguments of medieval scholastics that\nsailors cannot kiss their wives goodbye on Sundays, or hangmen go to\nheaven, but the dualisms associated with that worldview have continued\nto haunt the philosophical imagination. Beginning with Greek\nphilosophy\u2019s equation of the male principle with mind and reason and\nact, the female principle was associated with the contrasting\nidentification in terms of matter, body, passion and potency. The\nsubsequent history of Western philosophy, despite major conceptual\nshifts, displayed a characteristic logic and form. Taking the form of\nhierarchical opposition, the logic of binary structuring mutually\nopposed such elements as mind and body, reason and passion, object and\nsubject, transcendental and empirical. As argued by any number of\nfeminist philosophers, these hierarchical oppositions are typically\ngender-coded. Body, matter, emotions, instincts, and subjectivity are\ncoded as feminine, while mind, reason, science, objectivity are coded\nas masculine (see Bordo 1987, Harding & Hintikka 1983, Irigaray\n1977 [1985], Lloyd 1985). The specific link between this metaphysics\nand western conceptions of God is a complex chicken-and-egg question.\nCertainly it is fair to say that the Hellenizing of Christian theology\nfrom the second century C.E. on saddled classical theism with\nproblematic philosophical valences. But classical theism in turn\nreinforced and sanctioned the philosophical valorization of mind,\nreason, and male over and against body, passion, and female. Some\nfeminists would trace the cultural roots of this way of thinking to\nthe phenomenon of \u201cmale bodily alienation\u201d that arose in\nlate classical antiquity\u2019s asceticism (see Ruether 1983).\n\nIn any case, insofar as Western monotheism has constructed the meaning\nof \u201cGod\u201d in relation to \u201cworld\u201d around binary\noppositions of mind/body, reason/passion, and male/female, traditional\ntheism remains complicitous with the very system of gender constructs\nand symbolic structures that underlie women\u2019s oppression. In the\nbinary opposition between \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d,\nthe term \u201cGod\u201d occupies the privileged space and acts as\nthe central principle, the One who confers identity to creatures to\nwhom \u201cHe\u201d stands in hierarchical relation. Oppositional\npairing of God/world has served in turn to organize other categories,\nsuch as heaven and earth, sacred and profane. The widespread\ndistinction between sacred and profane, employed by many authors, thus\ncomes already encoded with the hierarchical oppositions of male/female\nand masculine/feminine onto which it is mapped, along with the\nstructurally related pairs, white/black and heterosexual/homosexual.\nThe first term in each pair is sacralized, while the second is\nrendered profane. This set of themes can be traced in connection with\nthe classic work of Durkheim and Weber in their theorizations of\nreligion (Erickson 1993).\n\nContemporary feminist philosophy of religion is also aware that the\nrelation between symbolic structures, on the one hand, and gender\nconstructions, on the other hand, cannot be specified in terms of a\nsingle explanatory model. The power of symbolic orders to invoke and\nreinscribe implicit gender understandings works in varied and complex\nways, as shown in studies by Bynum (1986), Fulkerson (1994), and\nHollywood (1995, 2002). Because religious symbols are polysemic and\nmultivalent, they hold different meanings for different people at\ndifferent times. It is never a simple matter of sheer reflection of\nthe given social order. The relation between society and symbol, or\nbetween psyche and symbol, is recognized as open-ended. Relations of\nreversal or inversion of actual social structures may obtain, making\nit risky for the interpreter to posit a single unidirectional\ncause-effect relation between symbol and social setting. As Bynum\npoints out, meaning is not so much imparted as it is appropriated\n\u201cin a dialectical process whereby it becomes subjective reality\nfor the one who uses the symbol\u201d, allowing for the possibility\nthat \u201cthose with different gender experiences will appropriate\nsymbols in different ways\u201d (1986: 9).\n\nIt follows that no necessary correlation can be assumed between\ngoddess-worshipping cultures and actual egalitarian social structures\nin the lives of females and males of that culture. Similarly, the male\nFather God may open up a range of different interpretative\npossibilities for both women and men. In culturally specific and\nhistorically unstable ways, religious symbols even of the male Father\nGod have been useful in resisting and subverting the social order, not\nonly reflecting and reinforcing it. In light of these considerations,\nmost feminist philosophers of religions regard it as risky to\ngeneralize across cultures, religious traditions, or historical\nperiods with respect to the different ways in which males and females\nappropriate or construct religious symbolism.\n",
