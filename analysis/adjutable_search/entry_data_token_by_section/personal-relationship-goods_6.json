    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods || Constitutive Value\n3.1 Constitutive Value\n\nOne of the main insights of the ethics of care is that some goods that\nare only available through close personal relationships are essential\nfor any flourishing life. Other philosophers have, more recently,\ndefended more specific claims.\n\nFirst, personal relationship goods realized in close relationships are\nconstitutive of good lives (Liao 2006; Lynch et al. 2009; Gheaus 2009,\n2017; Brownlee 2013, 2016a). This is perhaps most obvious for those\ngoods that have an affective quality (that is, most of them). The\nlargest longitudinal study in adult development to date (Vaillant\n2012) indicates that personal relationships are\u2014most likely\nthanks to the goods they generate\u2014indispensable to subjective\nlife satisfaction (but also positively correlated with other valuable\noutcomes such as longevity and health\u2014see\n 3.2).\n And an extensive study conducted by a team of philosophers and\nsociologists in Ireland revealed that close relationships and the\nunique goods they generate are for many adults the most important\ncomponent of their life plans, or at least more important than other\nforms of advantage (Lynch et al. 2009). For children, too, some\npersonal relationship goods, especially those available in\nparent-children relationships, are constitutive of good lives: it is\nhard to see how a good childhood could be (entirely) devoid of loving\ncare from parental figures, kindness from adults in general and\nfriendship with peers. Familial relationship goods\u2014including the\nspecial sort of intimacy between parents and children and the unique\nfiduciary responsibility of parents\u2014have also been said to be\nconstitutive of (most) potential parents\u2019 full flourishing\n(Brighouse & Swift 2014). On this latter account, the goods have\nconstitutive value in an objective sense.\n\nFurther personal relationship goods that are political may contribute\nin a constitutive way to good, or flourishing, lives (Brownlee 2013:\n200; Gheaus 2018). These goods include non-discrimination,\nnon-marginalization and non-domination by fellow citizens with whom we\nstand in personal relationships, such as those with whom we work in\npolitical organizations or with whom we repeatedly share public\nspaces.\n\nBecause personal relationship goods are part and parcel of good lives,\nsome believe we have duties to extend our friendship to others if we\ncan (Collins 2013). Onora O\u2019Neill (1988) thinks that adults have\na fundamental duty to be kind and cheerful towards children, and\ninvolved in their lives, but perhaps the duty could be extended to all\nindividuals. The duty is, originally, incomplete, or\nimperfect\u2014that is, not owed to all children and up to the agent\nto judge when to exercise. O\u2019Neill acknowledges that part of the\nduty can become perfect\u2014and its recipients can acquire\ncorresponding rights\u2014through institutionalization, which is what\nhappens when children are being taken into care; but she doubts that\nall the moral duties associated with the roles of parent, teacher or\nsocial worker can be institutionalized. More generally, one view is\nthat duties with respect to at least some of the personal relationship\ngoods are matters of benevolence rather than justice, and that\nattempts to institutionalize them would be particularly stigmatizing\nor otherwise self-defeating (Gheaus 2009; Valentini 2016). Another,\npossibly compatible, view, defended by Kimberley Brownlee is that the\nprovision of some personal relationship goods is a matter of justice\nwhen they are constitutive of minimally good lives.\nSpecifically, her claim is that there is a human right to the\nunconditional provision of enough opportunities for decent\ninterpersonal contact (Brownlee 2013, forthcoming). With respect to\nfamilial relationship goods, Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift (2014)\nargue that adults who would make adequate parents are owed an\nopportunity to enjoy the goods of intimate, caring and authoritative\nrelationships with children.\n",
