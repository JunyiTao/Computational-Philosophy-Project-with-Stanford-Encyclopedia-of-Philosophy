Like the behaviorists, the structuralists (e.g., Harris, \n1951) refused to postulate irreducibly theoretical entities; they \ninsisted that syntactic categories (such as \u2018noun phrase\u2019\n(\u2018NP\u2019) or \u2018verb phrase\u2019 (\u2018VP\u2019), \netc.) be reducible to properties of actual utterances (collected in \n\u2018corpora\u2019 \u2014 lists of things people have said). In \nhis landmark book, Syntactic Structures (1957), however, \nChomsky argued that because corpora can contain only finitely many \nsentences, no attempt at reduction can succeed. Linguists need \ntheoretical constructs that capture regularities going beyond the set\nof actual utterances, and that allow them to predict the properties \nof novel utterances. But if the category NP, for instance, is to \ninclude noun phrases that haven't been uttered yet, the meaning of \nnoun phrase can't be exhausted by what's in the corpus: the \nstructuralists' positivistic strictures on theoretical kinds are \nmisguided.\n\n\nIn addition, the structuralists had attempted to capture the \nsyntactic properties of languages in terms of simple rewrite rules \nknown as \u2018phrase structure rules.\u2019 Phrase structure rules\ndescribe the internal syntactic structures of sentence types; \ninterpreted as rewrite rules, they can be used to generate or \nconstruct sentences. Thus, the rule S \u2192 NP VP, for instance, \nsays that a sentence symbol S can be rewritten as the symbol NP \nfollowed by the symbol VP, and tells you that a sentence consists of \na noun phrase followed by a verb phrase. (This information can be \nrepresented via a tree-diagram, as in Fig. 1a, or by a phrasemarker \n(or labeled bracketing), as in Fig. 1b.)\n\n\n\n\n[[___]NP[___]VP]S\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Phrasemarkers representing a sentence as consisting of a \nnoun phrase and a verb phrase via (a) a tree diagram or (b) a labeled\nbracketing.\n\n\n\nOther rules, (such as NP \u2192 Det N, VP \u2192 V NP, Det \u2192 \na, the, \u2026, etc., V\u2192 hit, kiss\u2026, \netc.; N \u2192 boy, girl,\u2026, etc.) are subsequently \napplied, and (with still further rules not discussed here) allow for \nthe generation of sentences such as The boy kissed the girl, The \ngirl hits the boy, and so on. \n\n\nChomsky argued (on technical grounds; see Chomsky 1957, ch.1) that \ngrammars must be enriched with a second type of rule, known as \n\u2018transformations.\u2019 Unlike phrase structure rules, \ntransformations operate on whole sentences (or more strictly, their \nphrasemarkers); they allow for the generation of new sentences \n(/phrasemarkers) out of old ones. The Passive transformation\ndescribed in Chomsky 1957:112, for instance, specifies how to turn an\nactive sentence (/phrasemarker) into a passive one. Simplifying \nsomewhat, you take an active phrasemarker of the form NP \u2014 \nAux \u2014 V \u2014 NP, like Kate is biting \nMark, and rearrange its elements x1 \u2014 \nx2 \u2014 x3 \u2014 \nx4 as follows: x4 \u2014 \nx2 + be + en \u2014 \nx3 + by \u2014 x1 \nto get Mark bite (+ is + en) by \nKate. The parenthetical + en and + is invoke \nfurther operations on the verb bite that transform it into \nis being bitten, and ultimately Kate is biting Mark\nis \u2018transformed\u2019 into Mark is being bitten by \nKate.\n\n\nOnly a grammar containing both phrase structure and transformation \nrules, Chomsky argued, could generate a natural language \u2014 \n\u2018generate\u2019 in the sense that by stepwise application of \nthe rules, one could in principle build up from scratch all and only \nthe sentences that the language contains. Hence, Chomsky urged the \ndevelopment of generative grammars of this type.\n\n\nSyntactic theory has now gone well beyond this early vision \u2014 \nboth phrase structure and transformation rules were abandoned in \nsuccessive linguistic revolutions wrought by Chomsky and his students\nand colleagues (see Newmeyer 1986, 1997 for a history of generative \nlinguistics).\n\n\nBut what has not changed \u2014 and what is important for our \npurposes \u2014 is that in every version of the grammar of (say) \nEnglish, the rules governing the syntactic structure of sentences and\nphrases are stated in terms of syntactic categories that are highly \nabstracted from the properties of utterances that are accessible to \nexperience. As an example of this, consider the notion of a \ntrace. Traces are symbols that appear in phrasemarkers and \nmark the path of an element as it is moved from one position to \nanother at various stages of a sentence's derivation, as in (1), \nwhere ti markes the NP Jacob's position at an \nearlier stage in the derivation.\n\nJacobi seems [ti to have vanished]\n\n\n\nBut while traces are vital to the statement of many syntactic rules \nand regularities, they are \u2018empty categories\u2019 \u2014 \nthey are not audible in the sentence as spoken. (See Chomsky 1981 \nand Lasnik and Uriagereka 1986 for more on traces and other empty \ncategories.) Traces (and other similarly abstract properties of \nlanguages) thus raise a question for the theory of language \nacquisition. For if, as Chomsky maintains, mastery of language \ninvolves knowledge of rules stated in terms of sentences' syntactic \nproperties, and if those properties are not so to speak \n\u2018present\u2019 in the data, but are rather highly abstract and\n\u2018unobservable,\u2019 then it becomes hard to see how children \ncould possibly acquire knowledge of the rules concerning them. As a \nconsequence, children's feat in learning a language appears \nmiraculous: how could a child learn the myriad rules governing \nlinguistic expression given only her exposure to the sentences spoken\naround \n her?[4]\n\n\n\nIn response to this question, most 20th century theorists followed \nChomsky in holding that language acquisition could not occur unless \nmuch of the knowledge eventually attained were innate or inborn. The \ngap between what speaker-hearers know about language (its grammar, \namong other things) and the data they have access to during learning \n(the pld) is just too broad to be bridged by any process of \nlearning alone. It follows that since children patently do learn \nlanguage, they are not linguistic \u2018blank slates.\u2019 \nInstead, Chomsky and his followers maintained, human children are \nborn knowing the \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 or \u2018UG,\u2019\na theory describing the most fundamental properties of all natural \nlanguages (e.g., the facts that elements leave traces behind when \nthey move, and that their movements are constrained in various ways).\nLearning a particular language thus becomes the comparatively simple \nmatter of elaborating upon this antecedently possessed knowledge, and\nhence appears a much more tractable task for young children to \nattempt.\n\n\nOver the years, two conceptions of the innate contribution to \nlanguage learning and its elaboration during the learning process \nhave been proposed. In earlier writings (e.g., Chomsky 1965), Chomsky\nsaw learning a language as basically a matter of formulating and \ntesting hypotheses about its grammar \u2014 unconsciously, of \ncourse. He argued that in order to acquire the correct grammar, the \nchild must innately know a \u201ca linguistic theory that specifies \nthe form of the grammar of a possible human language\u201d (1965:25)\n\u2014 she must know UG in other words. He saw this knowledge as \nbeing embodied in a suite of innate linguistic abilities, concepts, \nand constraints on the kinds of grammatical rules learners can \npropose for testing. On this view (1965:30-31), the inborn UG \nincludes (i) a way of analyzing and representing the incoming \nlinguistic data; (ii) a set of linguistic concepts with which to \nstate grammatical hypotheses; (iii) a way of telling how the data \nbear on those hypotheses (an \u2018evaluation metric\u2019); and \n(iv) a very restrictive set of constraints on the hypotheses that are\navailable for consideration. (i) through (iv) constitute the \n\u2018initial state\u2019 of the language faculty, and the child \narrives at the final state (knowledge of her language) by performing \nwhat is basically a kind of scientific inquiry into its nature.\n\n\nBy the 1980's, a less intellectualized conception of how language is \nacquired began to supplant the hypothesis-testing model. Whereas the \nearly model saw the child as a \u2018little scientist,\u2019 \nactively (if unconsciously) figuring out the rules of grammar, the \nnew \u2018parameter-setting\u2019 model conceived language \nacquisition as a kind of growth or maturation; language acquisition \nis something that happens to you, not something you do. The innate UG\nwas no longer viewed as a set of tools for inference; rather, it was \nconceived as a highly articulated set of representations\nof actual grammatical principles. Of course, since not everyone ends \nup speaking the same language, these innate representations must \nallow for some variation. This is achieved in this model via\nthe notion of a \u2018parameter\u2019: some of the innately \nrepresented grammatical principles contain variables that may take \none of a certain (highly restricted) range of values. These different\n\u2018parameter settings\u2019 are determined by the child's \nlinguistic experience, and result in the acquisition of different \nlanguages. Thus, Chomsky (1988:61-62) compared the learner to a \nswitchbox: just as a switchbox's circuitry is all in place but for \nsome switches that need to be flicked to one position or another, the\nlearner's knowledge of language is basically all in place, but for \nsome linguistic \u2018switches\u2019 that are set by linguistic \nexperience.\n\n\nTo illustrate how parameter setting works, consider a simplified \nexample (discussed in more detail in Chomsky 1990:644-45). All \nlanguages require that sentences have subjects, but whereas some \nlanguages (like English) require that the subject be overt in the \nutterance, other languages (like Spanish) allow you to leave the \nsubject out of the sentence when it is written or spoken. Thus, a \nSpanish speaker who wanted to say that he speaks Spanish could say \nHablo espa\u00f1ol (leaving out the first personal pronoun\nyo) without violating the rules of Spanish, whereas an \nEnglish speaker wanting to express that thought could not say \n*Speak Spanish without violating the rules of English: to \nspeak grammatically, he must say I speak Spanish. The \nparameter-setting model accommodates this sort of difference by \nproposing that there is a \u2018Null Subject Parameter,\u2019 which\nis set differently in English and Spanish speakers: Spanish speakers \nset it to \u2018Subject Optional,\u2019 whereas in English \nspeakers, it is set to \u2018Subject Obligatory.\u2019 How? One \nproposal is that the parameter is set by default to \u2018Subject \nObligatory\u2019 and that hearing a subjectless sentence causes it \nto be set to \u2018Subject Optional.\u2019 Since children learning \nSpanish frequently hear subjectless sentences, whereas those learning\nEnglish do not, the parameter setting is switched in the Spanish \nlearner, but remains set at the default for the English learner. \n(Roeper and Williams 1987 is the locus classicus for \nparameter-setting models; Ayoun 2003 is more up-to-date; Pinker, \n1997: ch.3 provides a helpful, non-technical overview.)\n\n\nThese two approaches to language acquisition clearly differ \nsignificantly in their conception of the nature of the learning \nprocess and the learner's role in it, but we are not concerned to \nevaluate their respective merits here. Rather, the important point \nfor our purposes is that they both attribute substantial amounts of \ninnate information about language to the language learner. \nIn what follows, we will look in more detail at the various arguments\nthat have been used to support this \u2018nativist\u2019 theory of \nlanguage acquisition. We will focus on the following question:\n\n\nWhat evidence is there that children come to the language learning task\nequipped with a specialized store of inborn linguistic information,\nsuch as that specified in the linguist's theory of\nUniversal Grammar?\n\n\nTerminological Note: As Chomsky acknowledges (e.g., 1986:28-29), \n\u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 is used with a systematic ambiguity \nin his writings. Sometimes, the term refers to the inborn knowledge \nof language that learners are hypothesized to possess \u2014 the \ncontent of the \u2018initial state\u2019 of the language faculty \n\u2014 whatever that knowledge (/content) turns out to be. \nOther times, \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 is used to refer to \ncertain specific proposals as to the content of our innate \nlinguistic knowledge, such as the Government-Binding theorist's claim\nthat we have inborn knowledge of such things as the Principle of \nStructure Dependence, Binding theory, Theta theory, the Empty \nCategory Principle, etc.\n\n\nThis ambiguity is important when one is evaluating Chomskyan claims \nthat we have innate knowledge of UG. For on the first reading of \n\u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 distinguished above, that claim will \nbe true so long as any form of nativism turns out to be true\nof language learners (i.e., so long as they possess any \ninborn knowledge about language). On the second reading, however, it \nis possible that learners have innate knowledge of language \nwithout that knowledge's being knowledge of UG (as currently\ndescribed by linguists): learners might know things about language, \nyet not know Binding Theory, or the Principle of Structure \nDependence, etc.\n\n\nIn this entry, \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 will always be used in\nthe second of these senses, to refer to a specific theory as to the \ncontent of learners' innate knowledge of language. Where the issue \nconcerns merely their having some or other innate knowledge \nabout language (and is neutral on the question of whether any \nparticular theory about that knowledge is true), I will talk of \n\u2018innate linguistic information.\u2019 Clearly, an argument to \nthe effect that speakers have inborn knowledge of UG entails the \nclaim that they have innate linguistic information at their disposal.\nThe reverse, however, is not the case: there might be reason to think\nthat a speaker knows something about language innately, without its \nconstituting reason to think that what they know is Universal Grammar\nas described by Chomksyan linguists; Chomksy might be right that we \nhave innate knowledge about language, but wrong about what the \ncontent of that knowledge is. These issues will be \nclarified, as necessary, below.\n",
