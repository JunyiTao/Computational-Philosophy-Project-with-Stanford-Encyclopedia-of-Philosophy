    "main_text": "Replies to the Chinese Room Argument || The Brain Simulator Reply\n4.3 The Brain Simulator Reply\n\nConsider a computer that operates in quite a different manner than the\nusual AI program with scripts and operations on sentence-like strings\nof symbols. The Brain Simulator reply asks us to suppose instead the\nprogram simulates the actual sequence of nerve firings that occur in\nthe brain of a native Chinese language speaker when that person\nunderstands Chinese \u2013 every nerve, every firing. Since the\ncomputer then works the very same way as the brain of a native Chinese\nspeaker, processing information in just the same way, it will\nunderstand Chinese. Paul and Patricia Churchland have set out a reply\nalong these lines, discussed below. \n\nIn response to this, Searle argues that it makes no difference. He\nsuggests a variation on the brain simulator scenario: suppose that in\nthe room the man has a huge set of valves and water pipes, in the same\narrangement as the neurons in a native Chinese speaker\u2019s brain.\nThe program now tells the man which valves to open in response to\ninput. Searle claims that it is obvious that there would be no\nunderstanding of Chinese. (Note however that the basis for this claim\nis no longer simply that Searle himself wouldn\u2019t understand\nChinese \u2013 it seems clear that now he is just facilitating the\ncausal operation of the system and so we rely on our Leibnizian\nintuition that water-works don\u2019t understand (see also Maudlin\n1989).) Searle concludes that a simulation of brain activity is not\nthe real thing. \n\nHowever, following Pylyshyn 1980, Cole and Foelber 1984, Chalmers\n1996, we might wonder about hybrid systems. Pylyshyn writes: \n\nIf more and more of the cells in your brain were to be replaced by\nintegrated circuit chips, programmed in such a way as to keep the\ninput-output function each unit identical to that of the unit being\nreplaced, you would in all likelihood just keep right on speaking\nexactly as you are doing now except that you would eventually stop\nmeaning anything by it. What we outside observers might take to be\nwords would become for you just certain noises that circuits caused\nyou to make.\n\n\nThese cyborgization thought experiments can be linked to the Chinese\nRoom. Suppose Otto has a neural disease that causes one of the neurons\nin my brain to fail, but surgeons install a tiny remotely controlled\nartificial neuron, a synron, along side his disabled neuron. The\ncontrol of Otto\u2019s neuron is by John Searle in the Chinese Room,\nunbeknownst to both Searle and Otto. Tiny wires connect the artificial\nneuron to the synapses on the cell-body of his disabled neuron. When\nhis artificial neuron is stimulated by neurons that synapse on his\ndisabled neuron, a light goes on in the Chinese Room. Searle then\nmanipulates some valves and switches in accord with a program. That,\nvia the radio link, causes Otto\u2019s artificial neuron to release\nneuro-transmitters from its tiny artificial vesicles. If\nSearle\u2019s programmed activity causes Otto\u2019s artificial\nneuron to behave just as his disabled natural neuron once did, the\nbehavior of the rest of his nervous system will be unchanged. Alas,\nOtto\u2019s disease progresses; more neurons are replaced by synrons\ncontrolled by Searle. Ex hypothesi the rest of the world will not\nnotice the difference; will Otto?  If so, when? And why?\n\nUnder the rubric \u201cThe Combination Reply\u201d, Searle also\nconsiders a system with the features of all three of the preceding: a\nrobot with a digital brain simulating computer in its cranium, such\nthat the system as a whole behaves indistinguishably from a human.\nSince the normal input to the brain is from sense organs, it is\nnatural to suppose that most advocates of the Brain Simulator Reply\nhave in mind such a combination of brain simulation, Robot, and\nSystems Reply. Some (e.g. Rey 1986) argue it is reasonable to\nattribute intentionality to such a system as a whole. Searle agrees\nthat it would indeed be reasonable to attribute understanding to such\nan android system \u2013 but only as long as you don\u2019t know how\nit works. As soon as you know the truth \u2013 it is a computer,\nuncomprehendingly manipulating symbols on the basis of syntax, not\nmeaning \u2013 you would cease to attribute intentionality to it.\n\n(One assumes this would be true even if it were one\u2019s spouse,\nwith whom one had built a life-long relationship, that was revealed to\nhide a silicon secret. Science fiction stories, including episodes of\nRod Serling\u2019s television series The Twilight Zone, have\nbeen based on such possibilities (the face of the beloved peels away\nto reveal the awful android truth); however, Steven Pinker (1997)\nmentions one episode in which the android\u2019s secret was known\nfrom the start, but the protagonist developed a romantic relationship\nwith the android.)\n\nOn its tenth anniversary the Chinese Room argument was featured in the\ngeneral science periodical Scientific American. Leading the\nopposition to Searle\u2019s lead article in that issue were\nphilosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. The Churchlands agree with\nSearle that the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese, but hold\nthat the argument itself exploits our ignorance of cognitive and\nsemantic phenomena. They raise a parallel case of \u201cThe Luminous\nRoom\u201d where someone waves a magnet and argues that the absence\nof resulting visible light shows that Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetic\ntheory is false. The Churchlands advocate a view of the brain as a\nconnectionist system, a vector transformer, not a system manipulating\nsymbols according to structure-sensitive rules. The system in the\nChinese Room uses the wrong computational strategies. Thus they agree\nwith Searle against traditional AI, but they presumably would endorse\nwhat Searle calls \u201cthe Brain Simulator Reply\u201d, arguing\nthat, as with the Luminous Room, our intuitions fail us when\nconsidering such a complex system, and it is a fallacy to move from\npart to whole: \u201c\u2026 no neuron in my brain understands\nEnglish, although my whole brain does.\u201d\n\nIn his 1991 book, Microcognition. Andy Clark holds that\nSearle is right that a computer running Schank\u2019s program does\nnot know anything about restaurants, \u201cat least if by\n\u2018know\u2019 we mean anything like\n\u2018understand\u2019\u201d. But Searle thinks that this would\napply to any computational model, while Clark, like the Churchlands,\nholds that Searle is wrong about connectionist models. Clark\u2019s\ninterest is thus in the brain-simulator reply. The brain thinks in\nvirtue of its physical properties. What physical properties of the\nbrain are important? Clark answers that what is important about brains\nare \u201cvariable and flexible substructures\u201d which\nconventional AI systems lack. But that doesn\u2019t mean\ncomputationalism or functionalism is false. It depends on what level\nyou take the functional units to be. Clark defends\n\u201cmicrofunctionalism\u201d \u2013 one should look to a\nfine-grained functional description, e.g. neural net level. Clark\ncites William Lycan approvingly contra Block\u2019s absent qualia\nobjection \u2013 yes, there can be absent qualia, if the functional\nunits are made large. But that does not constitute a refutation of\nfunctionalism generally. So Clark\u2019s views are not unlike the\nChurchlands\u2019, conceding that Searle is right about Schank and\nsymbolic-level processing systems, but holding that he is mistaken\nabout connectionist systems.\n\nSimilarly Ray Kurzweil (2002) argues that Searle\u2019s argument\ncould be turned around to show that human brains cannot understand\n\u2013 the brain succeeds by manipulating neurotransmitter\nconcentrations and other mechanisms that are in themselves\nmeaningless. In criticism of Searle\u2019s response to the Brain\nSimulator Reply, Kurzweil says: \u201cSo if we scale up\nSearle\u2019s Chinese Room to be the rather massive\n\u2018room\u2019 it needs to be, who\u2019s to say that the entire\nsystem of a hundred trillion people simulating a Chinese Brain that\nknows Chinese isn\u2019t conscious? Certainly, it would be correct to\nsay that such a system knows Chinese. And we can\u2019t say that it\nis not conscious anymore than we can say that about any other process.\nWe can\u2019t know the subjective experience of another\nentity\u2026.\u201d \n",
