Its laboratory\nroutines or experimental regimens are neglected by cognitive\nethologists and ecological psychologists convinced that its methods\nare irrelevant to studying how animals and persons behave in their\nnatural and social environment. Its traditional relative indifference\ntowards neuroscience and deference to environmental contingencies is\nrejected by neuroscientists sure that direct study of the brain is the\nonly way to understand the truly proximate causes of behavior.\n\nBut by no means has behaviorism disappeared. Robust elements of\nbehaviorism survive in both behavior therapy and laboratory-based\nanimal learning theory (of which more below). In the metaphysics of\nmind, too, behavioristic themes survive in the approach to mind known\nas Functionalism. Functionalism defines states of mind as states that\nplay causal-functional roles in animals or systems in which they\noccur. Paul Churchland writes of Functionalism as follows: \u201cThe\nessential or defining feature of any type of mental states is the set\nof causal relations it bears to \u2026 bodily behavior\u201d (1984,\np. 36). This functionalist notion is similar to the behaviorist idea\nthat reference to behavior and to stimulus/response relations enters\ncentrally and essentially into any account of what it means for a\ncreature to behave or to be subject, in the scheme of analytical or\nlogical behaviorism, to the attribution of mental states. \n\nFans of the so-called and now widely discussed Extended Mind\nHypothesis (EMH) also share a kinship with behaviorism or at least\nwith Skinner. The defining hypothesis of EMH is that\n\u201cmental\u201d representation is a matter that spills out from\nthe brain or head into the world and cultural environment (Levy 2007).\nRepresentations are things external to the head or which bear special\nindividuating relationships with external devices or forms of cultural\nactivity. Skinner\u2019s misgivings about depicting the power of\nmental representation as something confined to the head (brain, inner\nmind) are at least loosely akin to EMH\u2019s shift to depict\nrepresentationality as environmentally extended.\n\nElements, however, are elements. Behaviorism is no longer a dominating\nresearch program. \n\nWhy has the influence of behaviorism declined? The deepest and most\ncomplex reason for behaviorism\u2019s decline in influence is its\ncommitment to the thesis that behavior can be explained without\nreference to non-behavioral and inner mental (cognitive,\nrepresentational, or interpretative) activity. Behavior, for Skinner,\ncan be explained just by reference to its \u201cfunctional\u201d\n(Skinner\u2019s term) relation to or co-variation with the\nenvironment and to the animal\u2019s history of environmental\ninteraction. Neurophysiological and neurobiological conditions, for\nSkinner, sustain or implement these functional or causal relations.\nBut they do not serve as ultimate or independent sources or\nexplanations of behavior. Behavior, Skinner (1953) wrote, cannot be\naccounted for \u201cwhile staying wholly inside [an animal];\neventually we must turn to forces operating upon the organism from\nwithout.\u201d \u201cUnless there is a weak spot in our causal chain\nso that the second [neurological] link is not lawfully determined by\nthe first [environmental stimuli], or the third [behavior] by the\nsecond, the first and third links must be lawfully related.\u201d (p.\n35) \u201cValid information about the second link may throw light on\nthis relationship but can in no way alter it.\u201d (ibid.) It is\n\u201cexternal variables of which behavior is a function.\u201d\n(ibid.) \n\nSkinner was no triumphalist about neuroscience. Neuroscience, for him,\nmore or less just identifies organismic physical processes that\nunderlie animal/environment interactions. Therein, it rides evidential\nor epistemic piggyback on radical behaviorism\u2019s prior\ndescription of those interactions. \u201cThe organism\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cis not empty, and it cannot adequately be treated simply\nas a black box\u201d (1976, p. 233). \u201cSomething is done today\nwhich affects the behavior of the organism tomorrow\u201d (p. 233).\nNeuroscience describes inside-the-box mechanisms that permit\ntoday\u2019s reinforcing stimulus to affect tomorrow\u2019s\nbehavior. The neural box is not empty, but it is unable, except in\ncases of malfunction or breakdown, to disengage the animal from past\npatterns of behavior that have been reinforced. It cannot exercise\nindependent or non-environmentally countervailing authority over\nbehavior.\n\nFor many critics of behaviorism it seems obvious that, at a minimum,\nthe occurrence and character of behavior (especially human behavior)\ndoes not depend primarily upon an individual\u2019s reinforcement\nhistory, although that is a factor, but on the fact that the\nenvironment or learning history is represented by an individual and\nhow (the manner in which) it is represented. The fact that the\nenvironment is represented by me constrains or informs the functional\nor causal relations that hold between my behavior and the environment\nand may, from an anti-behaviorist perspective, partially disengage my\nbehavior from its conditioning or reinforcement history. No matter,\nfor example, how tirelessly and repeatedly I have been reinforced for\npointing to or eating ice cream, such a history is impotent if I just\ndon\u2019t see a potential stimulus as ice cream or represent it to\nmyself as ice cream or if I desire to hide the fact that something is\nice cream from others. My conditioning history, narrowly understood as\nunrepresented by me, is behaviorally less important than the\nenvironment or my learning history as represented or interpreted by\nme.\n\nSimilarly, for many critics of behaviorism, if representationality\ncomes between environment and behavior, this implies that Skinner is\ntoo restrictive or limited in his attitude towards the role of brain\nmechanisms in producing or controlling behavior. The brain is no mere\npassive memory bank of behavior/environment interactions (see Roediger\nand Goff 1998). The central nervous system, which otherwise sustains\nmy reinforcement history, contains systems or neurocomputational\nsub-systems that implement or encode whatever representational content\nor meaning the environment has for me. It is also an active\ninterpretation machine or semantic engine, often critically performing\nenvironmentally untethered and behavior controlling tasks. Such talk\nof representation or interpretation, however, is a perspective from\nwhich behaviorism\u2014most certainly in Skinner\u2014 wishes and\ntries to depart.\n\nOne defining aspiration of traditional behaviorism is that it tried to\nfree psychology from having to theorize about how animals and persons\nrepresent (internally, in the head) their environment. This effort at\nfreedom was important, historically, because it seemed that\nbehavior/environment connections are a lot clearer and more manageable\nexperimentally than internal representations. Unfortunately, for\nbehaviorism, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more restrictive rule for\npsychology than one which prohibits hypotheses about representational\nstorage and processing. Stephen Stich, for example, complains against\nSkinner that \u201cwe now have an enormous collection of experimental\ndata which, it would seem, simply cannot be made sense of unless we\npostulate something like\u201d information processing mechanisms in\nthe heads of organisms (1998, p. 649).\n\nA second reason for rejecting behaviorism is that some features of\nmentality\u2014some elements, in particular, of the conscious mental\nlife of persons\u2014have characteristic \u2018qualia\u2019 or\npresentationally immediate or phenomenal qualities. To be in pain, for\nexample, is not merely to produce appropriate pain behavior under the\nright environmental circumstances, but it is to experience a\n\u2018like-thisness\u2019 to the pain (as something dull or sharp,\nperhaps). A purely behaviorist creature, a \u2018zombie\u2019, as it\nwere, may engage in pain behavior, including beneath the skin pain\nresponses, yet completely lack whatever is qualitatively distinctive\nof and proper to pain (its painfulness). (See also Graham 1998, pp.\n47\u201351 and Graham and Horgan 2000. On the scope of the phenomenal\nin human mentality, see Graham, Horgan, and Tienson 2009).\n\nThe philosopher-psychologist U. T. Place, although otherwise\nsympathetic to the application of behaviorist ideas to matters of\nmind, argued that phenomenal qualia cannot be analyzed in behaviorist\nterms. He claimed that qualia are neither behavior nor dispositions to\nbehave. \u201cThey make themselves felt,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom\nthe very moment that the experience of whose qualia they are\u201d\ncomes into existence (2000, p. 191; reprinted in Graham and Valentine\n2004). They are instantaneous features of processes or events rather\nthan dispositions manifested over time. Qualitative mental events\n(such as sensations, perceptual experiences, and so on), for Place,\nundergird dispositions to behave rather than count as dispositions.\nIndeed, it is tempting to postulate that the qualitative aspects of\nmentality affect non-qualitative elements of internal processing, and\nthat they, for example, contribute to arousal, attention, and\nreceptivity to associative conditioning.\n\nThe third reason for rejecting behaviorism is connected with Noam\nChomsky. Chomsky has been one of behaviorism\u2019s most successful\nand damaging critics. In a review of Skinner\u2019s book on verbal\nbehavior (see above), Chomsky (1959) charged that behaviorist models\nof language learning cannot explain various facts about language\nacquisition, such as the rapid acquisition of language by young\nchildren, which is sometimes referred to as the phenomenon of\n\u201clexical explosion.\u201d A child\u2019s linguistic abilities\nappear to be radically underdetermined by the evidence of verbal\nbehavior offered to the child in the short period in which he or she\nexpresses those abilities. By the age of four or five (normal)\nchildren have an almost limitless capacity to understand and produce\nsentences which they have never heard before. Chomsky also argued that\nit seems plainly untrue that language learning depends on the\napplication of detailed reinforcement. A child does not, as an English\nspeaker in the presence of a house, utter \u201chouse\u201d\nrepeatedly in the presence of reinforcing elders. Language as such\nseems to be learned without, in a sense, being explicitly taught or\ntaught in detail, and behaviorism doesn\u2019t offer an account of\nhow this could be so. Chomsky\u2019s own speculations about the\npsychological realities underlying language development include the\nhypothesis that the rules or principles underlying linguistic behavior\nare abstract (applying to all human languages) and innate (part of our\nnative psychological endowment as human beings). When put to the test\nof uttering a grammatical sentence, a person, for Chomsky, has a\nvirtually infinite number of possible responses available, and the\nonly way in which to understand this virtually infinite generative\ncapacity is to suppose that a person possesses a powerful and abstract\ninnate grammar (underlying whatever competence he or she may have in\none or more particular natural languages).\n\nThe problem to which Chomsky refers, which is the problem of\nbehavioral competence and thus performance outstripping individual\nlearning histories, goes beyond merely the issue of linguistic\nbehavior in young children. It appears to be a fundamental fact about\nhuman beings that our behavior and behavioral capacities often surpass\nthe limitations of individual reinforcement histories. Our history of\nreinforcement is often too impoverished to determine uniquely what we\ndo or how we do it. Much learning, therefore, seems to require\npre-existing or innate representational structures or principled\nconstraints within which learning occurs. (See also Brewer 1974, but\ncompare with Bates et al. 1998 and Cowie 1998).\n\nIs the case against behaviorism definitive? Decisive? Paul Meehl noted\ndecades ago that theories in psychology seem to disappear not under\nthe force of decisive refutation but rather because researchers lose\ninterest in their theoretical orientations (Meehl 1978). One\nimplication of Meehl\u2019s thesis is that a once popular\n\u201cIsm\u201d, not having been decisively refuted, may restore\nsome of its former prominence if it mutates or transforms itself so as\nto incorporate responses to criticisms. What may this mean for\nbehaviorism? It may mean that some version of the doctrine might\nrebound.\n\nSkinner claimed that neural activities subserve or underlie\nbehavior/environment relations and that the organism\u2019s\ncontribution to these relations does not reduce to neurophysiological\nproperties. But this does not mean that behaviorism cannot gain useful\nalliance with neuroscience. Reference to brain structures\n(neurobiology, neurochemistry, and so on) may help in explaining\nbehavior even if such references do not ultimately displace reference\nto environmental contingencies in a behaviorist account.\n\nSuch is a lesson of animal modeling in which behaviorist themes still\nenjoy currency. Animal models of addiction, habit and instrumental\nlearning are particularly noteworthy because they bring behavioral\nresearch into closer contact than did traditional psychological\nbehaviorism with research on the brain mechanisms underlying\nreinforcement, especially positive reinforcement (West 2006, pp.\n91\u2013108). One result of this contact is the discovery that\nsensitized neural systems responsible for heightened reinforcement\nvalue or strength can be dissociated from the hedonic utility or\npleasurable quality of reinforcement (see Robinson and Berridge 2003).\nThe power of a stimulus to reinforce behavior may be independent of\nwhether it is a source or cause of pleasure. Focus on brain mechanisms\nunderlying reinforcement also forms the centerpiece of one of the most\nactive research programs in current neuroscience, so-called\nneuroeconomics, which weds study of the brain\u2019s reward systems\nwith models of valuation and economic decision making (see Montague\nand Berns 2002; Nestler and Malenka 2004; Ross et al 2008).\nBehaviorism may do well to purchase some of neuroeconomic\u2019s\nconceptual currency, especially since some advocates of the program\nsee themselves as behaviorists in spirit if not stereotypical letter\nand honor the work of a number of theorists in the behavioristic\ntradition of the experimental analysis of behavior, such as George\nAinslie, Richard Herrnstein and Howard Rachlin, on how patterns of\nbehavior relate to patterns of reward or reinforcement (see Ross et\nal. 2008, especially p. 10). One important assumption in\nneuroeconomics is that full explanations of organism/environmental\ninteractions will combine facts about such things as reinforcement\nschedules with appeal to neurocomputational modeling and to the\nneurochemistry and neurobiology of reinforcement. \n\nOther potential sources of utility or renewal? The continued\npopularity of so-called economic behavior therapy is noteworthy\nbecause it offers a potential domain of testing application for the\nregimen of behaviorism. Early versions of behavior therapy sought to\napply restricted results from Skinnerian or Pavlovian conditioning\nparadigms to human behavior problems. No minds should be spoken of;\njust behavior\u2014stimuli, responses, and reinforcement. Therapy\nshapes behavior not thought. Successive generations of behavior\ntherapy relax those conceptual restrictions. Advocates refer to\nthemselves as cognitive behavior therapists (e.g. Mahoney 1974;\nMeichenbaum 1977). Clients\u2019 behavior problems are described by\nreferring to their beliefs, desires, intentions, memories, and so on.\nEven the language of self-reflexive thought and belief (so-called\n\u2018meta-cognition\u2019) figures in some accounts of behavioral\ndifficulties and interventions (Wells 2000). One goal of such language\nis to encourage clients to monitor and self-reinforce their own\nbehavior. Self-reinforcement is an essential feature of behavioral\nself-control (Rachlin 2000; Ainslie 2001). The monitoring process\nmay include a number of checking and error detection processes and\ncorrection of behavior in a client\u2019s current life circumstances\n(West 2006).\n\nIt may be wondered whether cognitive behavior therapy is aptly\nconsistent with behaviorist doctrine. Much depends on how beliefs and\ndesires are understood. If beliefs and desires are understood as\nstates that somehow spill out into the environment and are\nindividuated in terms of their non-mentalistic, behavior-like role in\norganism/environment interactions, this would be consistent with\ntraditional behaviorist doctrine. It would reflect the principle of\nlogical or analytical behaviorism that if mental terms are to be used\nin the description and explanation of behavior, they must be defined\nor paraphrased in non-mental behavioral terms. Prospects for\nbelief/desire individuation in non-mental, environmentally externalist\nterms may look doubtful however, especially in cases of conscious\nattitudes(see Horgan, Tienson and Graham 2006). But the topic of the\nforms and limits of behavior therapy and the range of its plausible\napplication is open for continued further exploration. \n",
