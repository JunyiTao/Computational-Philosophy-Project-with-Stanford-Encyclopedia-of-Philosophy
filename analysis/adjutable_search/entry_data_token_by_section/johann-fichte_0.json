    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nFichte was born May 19, 1762 in the village of Rammenau in the\nOberlausitz area of Saxony. He was the eldest son in a family of poor\nand pious ribbon weavers. His extraordinary intellectual talent soon\nbrought him to the attention of a local baron, who sponsored his\neducation, first in the home of a local pastor, then at the famous\nPforta boarding school, and finally at the universities of Jena and\nLeipzig. With the death of his patron, Fichte was forced to\ndiscontinue his studies and seek his livelihood as a private tutor, a\nprofession he quickly came to detest.\n\nFollowing a lengthy sojourn in Zurich, were he met his future wife,\nJohanna Rahn, Fichte returned to Leipzig with the intention of\npursuing a literary career. When his projects failed, he was again\nforced to survive as a tutor. It was in this capacity that he began\ngiving lessons on the Kantian philosophy in the summer of 1790. This\nfirst encounter with Kant\u2019s writings produced what Fichte\nhimself described as a \u201crevolution\u201d in his manner of\nthinking. Whereas he had formally been torn between, on the one hand,\na practical commitment to the moral improvement of humanity and, on\nthe other, a theoretical commitment to \u201cintelligible\nfatalism,\u201d he found in the Critical philosophy a way of\nreconciling his \u201chead\u201d and \u201cheart\u201d in a system\nthat could meet the highest intellectual standards without requiring\nhim to sacrifice his belief in human freedom.\n\nFichte eventually made his way to K\u00f6nigsberg, where he lived for\na few months. After a disappointing interview with Kant, he resolved\nto demonstrate his mastery of the latter\u2019s philosophy by writing\na treatise on a theme as yet unaddressed by Kant: namely, the question\nof the compatibility of the Critical philosophy with any concept of\ndivine revelation. In a few weeks Fichte composed a remarkable\nmanuscript in which he concluded that the only revelation consistent\nwith the Critical philosophy is the moral law itself. Kant was\nsufficiently impressed by the talent of this unknown and impoverished\nyoung man to offer to arrange for the publication of Fichte\u2019s\nmanuscript, which was published by Kant\u2019s own publisher in 1792\nunder the title Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation. The\nfirst edition of this work, however, for reasons that have never been\nsatisfactorily explained, appeared without the author\u2019s name and\npreface and was quickly and widely hailed as a work by Kant himself.\nWhen the true identity of its author was revealed, Fichte was\nimmediately catapulted from total obscurity to philosophical\ncelebrity.\n\nMeanwhile, Fichte was once again employed as a private tutor, this\ntime on an estate near Danzig, where he wrote several, anonymously\npublished political tracts. The first of these was published in 1793\nwith the provocative title Reclamation of the Freedom of Thought\nfrom the Princes of Europe, who have hitherto Suppressed it. In\nthe summer of 1793 Fichte returned to Zurich where he married his\nfianc\u00e9 and oversaw the publication of the first two\ninstallments of his spirited Contribution to the Rectification of\nthe Public\u2019s Judgment of the French Revolution (1793 and\n1794). In this work he not only defended the principles (if not all\nthe practices) of the French revolutionaries, but also attempted to\noutline his own democratic view of legitimate state authority and\ninsisted on the right of revolution. Despite the fact that these\npolitical writings were published anonymously, the author\u2019s\nidentity was widely known, and Fichte thereby acquired a reputation,\nnot wholly deserved, as a radical \u201cJacobin.\u201d\n\nFollowing the completion of these projects, Fichte devoted his time in\nZurich to rethinking and revising his own philosophical position.\nWhile maintaining his allegiance to the new Critical or Kantian\nphilosophy, Fichte was powerfully impressed by the efforts of K. L.\nReinhold to provide the Critical philosophy with a new, more secure\n\u201cfoundation\u201d and to base the entire system upon a single\n\u201cfirst principle.\u201d At the same time, he became acquainted\nwith the works of two authors who were engaged in skeptical attacks\nupon the philosophies of both Kant and Reinhold: Solomon Maimon and G.\nE. Schulze (\u201cAenesidemus\u201d). It was the need to respond to\nthe sharp criticisms of these authors that eventually led Fichte to\nconstruct his own, unique version of transcendental idealism, for\nwhich, in the spring of 1794, he eventually coined the name\nWissenschaftslehre (\u201cDoctrine of Science\u201d or\n\u201cTheory of Scientific Knowledge\u201d). During the winter of\n1793/94 he composed a long manuscript, \u201cPrivate Mediations on\nElementary Philosophy/Pracical Philosophy,\u201d in which worked out\nsome of the fundamental features of his new system. In Feburary and\nMarch of 1794 he gave a series of private lectures on his conception\nof philosophy before a small circle of influential clerics and\nintellectuals in Zurich.\n\nIt was at this moment that he received an invitation to assume the\nrecently vacated chair of Critical Philosophy at the University of\nJena, which was rapidly emerging as the capital of the new German\nphilosophy. Fichte arrived in Jena in May of 1794, and enjoyed\ntremendous popular success there for the next six years, during which\ntime he laid the foundations and developed the first systematic\narticulations of his new system. Even as he was engaged in this\nimmense theoretical labor, he also tried to address a larger, popular\naudience and also threw himself into various practical efforts to\nreform university life. As one bemused colleague observed, \u201chis\nis a restless spirit; he thirsts for some opportunity to act in the\nworld. Fichte wants to employ his philosophy to guide the spirit of\nhis age.\u201d Indeed, a passionate desire to \u201chave an\neffect\u201d upon his own age remained a central feature of\nFichte\u2019s character, most notably expressed a decade later in his\ncelebrated Addresses to the German Nation, delivered in\nBerlin in 1806 during the French occupation. In Jena, this same desire\nis reflected in the enormously popular series of public lectures on\n\u201cMorality for Scholars,\u201d which he began to deliver\nimmediately upon his arrival in Jena. The first five of these lectures\nwere published in 1794 under the title Some Lectures concerning\nthe Scholar\u2019s Vocation.\n\nThough Fichte has already hinted at his new philosophical position in\nhis 1794 review of G. E. Schulze\u2019s Aenesidemus, the\nfirst full-scale public announcement of the same came in a short\nmanifesto that he published as a means of introducing himself to his\nnew students and colleagues at Jena and attracting listeners to his\nlectures. (As an \u201cextraordinary professor,\u201d Fichte was\nlargely dependent upon fees paid by students attending his\n\u201cprivate\u201d lectures.) This manifesto, Concerning the\nConcept of the Wissenschaftslehre (1794), articulated some of the\nbasic ideas of the new philosophy, but it mainly focused upon\nquestions of systematic form and the relationship between philosophy\nand its proper object (the necessary actions of the human mind).\n\nFichte\u2019s first truly systematic work was his Foundation of\nthe Entire Wissenschaftslehre (1794/95). As the title implies,\nthis work, which remains to this day Fichte\u2019s best-known\nphilosophical treatise, was not meant to be a presentation of his\nentire system, but only of the rudiments or first principles of the\nsame. In fact, Fichte had not originally intended to publish this work\nat all, which was written less than a year after his first tentative\nefforts to articulate for himself his new conception of transcendental\nphilosophy. The Foundation was originally intended to be\ndistributed, in fascicles, to students attending his private lectures\nduring his first two semesters at Jena, where the printed sheets could\nbe subjected to analysis and questions and supplemented with oral\nexplanations. Because of the great interest in Fichte\u2019s new\nphilosophy, however, he soon authorized a public edition of the same,\nin two volumes. Parts I and II of the Foundation were\npublished in 1794 and Part II in 1795. In 1795 he also published a\nsubstantial supplement to the Foundation, under the title\nOutline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre\nwith Respect to the Theoretical Faculty. The title pages of all\nthree of these publications, however, still stipulated that they were\nintended only as \u201ca manuscript for the use of his\nlisteners.\u201d (When, in 1802, Fichte issued a second, one-volume\nedition of the Foundation and Outline, in 1801, this\nsubtitle was dropped.)\n\nDissatisfied with many features of his initial presentation of the\n\u201cfoundational\u201d portion of his system and shocked by the\nvirtually universal misunderstanding of his published\nFoundation, Fichte immediately set to work on an entirely new\nexposition of the same, which he repeated three times in his private\nlectures on \u201cThe Foundations of Transcendental Philosophy\n(Wissenschaftslehre) nova methodo\u201d (1796/76, 1797/98,\n1798/99). Though he intended to revise these lectures for serial\npublication under the title An Attempt a New Presentation of the\nWissenschaftslehre in the Philosophisches Journal einer\nGesellschaft Teutscher Gelehrten, of which he himself was by then\nco-editor, only the two Introductions to and the first chapter of this\n\u201cNew Presentation\u201d ever appeared (1797/98).\n\nEven as he was thoroughly revising his presentation of the\nfoundational portion of his system, Fichte was simultaneously engaged\nin elaborating the various subdivisions or systematic branches of the\nsame. As was his custom, he did this first in his private lectures and\nthen in published texts based upon the same. The first such extension\nwas into the realm of philosophy of law and social philosophy, which\nresulted in the publication Foundations of Natural Right in\naccordance with the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre\n(published in two volumes in 1796 and 1797). The second extension was\ninto the realm of moral philosophy, which resulted in the publication\nof the System of Ethics in accordance with the Principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre (1798). Fichte then planned to extend his\nsystem into the realm of philosophy of religion. Indeed, he announced\nlectures on this topic for the Spring Semester of 1799, but before he\ncould commence these lectures, his career at Jena had come to an\nabrupt and unhappy conclusion in the wake of the so-called\n\u201cAtheism Controversy\u201d of 1798/99.\n\nIn 1798 Fichte published in his Philosophical Journal a brief\nessay \u201cOn the Basis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the\nWorld,\u201d in which he attempted to sketch some of his preliminary\nideas on the topic indicated in the title and simultaneously to give\nthe first clear public hint of the character of a philosophy of\nreligion \u201cin accordance with the principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre.\u201d The occasion for this essay was\nanother essay, published in the same issue of the Philosophical\nJournal, by K. L. Forberg. As it happened, these two essays\nprovoked an anonymous author to publish a pamphlet charging the\nauthors of both essays with atheism and demanding Fichte\u2019s\ndismissal from his post at Jena. The matter quickly escalated into a\nmajor public controversy which eventually led to the official\nsuppression of the offending issue of the journal and to public\nthreats by various German princes to prevent their students from\nenrolling at the University of Jena. The crisis produced by these\nactions and the growing number of publications for and against\nFichte\u2014which included an intemperate Appeal to the\nPublic by Fichte himself (1799), as well as a more thoughtful\nresponse entitled \u201cFrom a Private Letter\u201d\n(1799)\u2014eventually provoked F. H. Jacobi to publish his famous\n\u201copen letter\u201d to Fichte, in which he equated philosophy in\ngeneral and Fichte\u2019s transcendental philosophy in particular\nwith \u201cnihilism.\u201d As the public controversy unfolded,\nFichte badly miscalculated his own position and was finally forced to\nresign his position at Jena and to flee to Berlin, where he arrived in\nthe summer of 1799.\n\nAt this point, the Prussian capital had no university of its own, and\nFichte was forced to support himself by giving private tutorials and\nlectures on the Wissenschaftslehre and by a new flurry of\nliterary production, increasingly aimed at a large, popular audience.\nThe first of these \u201cpopular\u201d writings was a brilliant\npresentation of some of the characteristic doctrines and conclusions\nof Fichte\u2019s system, with a strong emphasis upon the moral and\nreligious character of the same. This work, The Vocation of\nMan (1800), which is perhaps Fichte\u2019s greatest literary\nachievements, was intended as an indirect response to Jacobi\u2019s\npublic repudiation of the Wissenschaftslehre. That same year\nalso saw the publication of a typically bold foray into political\neconomy, The Closed Commercial State, in which Fichte\npropounds a curious blend of socialist political ideas and autarkic\neconomic principles. Defending his philosophy against misunderstanding\nremained, however, Fichte\u2019s chief concern during this period, as\nis evidenced by the more direct response to Jacobi contained in his\npoignantly titled Sun-Clear Report to the Public at Large\nconcerning the Actual Character of the latest Philosophy: An Attempt\nto Force the Reader to Understand (1801).\n\nAt the same time that he was addressing the public in this manner,\nFichte was becoming ever more deeply engrossed in efforts to rethink\nand to rearticulate the very foundations of his system, beginning with\nhis private lectures on the Wissenschaftslehre of 1801/2, and\nculminating in the three, radically new versions of the same produced\nduring the year 1804. Indeed, he continued to produce new versions of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre right up until his death, delivering\nnew versions of his system in 1805, 1807, 1810, 1811, 1812, 1813, and\n1814 (though the last two versions were cut short, the first by the\nwar with France and the second by Fichte\u2019s death). However, with\nthe single exception of the extraordinarily condensed (and\nextraordinarily opaque) Presentation of the General Outlines of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre (1810), none of these later versions of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre was published during Fichte\u2019s\nlifetime. Some of them appeared, in severely edited form, in the\ncollection of Fichte\u2019s Works published by his son\nseveral decades following his death, but most of them are only now\nbeing published for the first time in the critical edition of\nFichte\u2019s writings produced by the Bavarian Academy of the\nSciences. It appears that Fichte was so discouraged by the public\nreception of the first, 1794/95 presentation of the foundation of his\nsystem that he concluded that it was prudent to limit future new\npresentations of the same to the lecture hall and seminar room, where\nhe could elicit reactions and objections from his listeners and\nrespond immediately with the requisite corrections and clarifications.\nBe that as it may, Fichte never stopped trying to refine his\nphilosophical insights and to revise his systematic presentation of\nthe same. Thus there are more than a dozen different full-scale\npresentations or versions of the Wissenschaftslehre, most of\nwhich were written after his departure from Jena. \u201cThe\nWissenschaftslehre\u201d is not the name of a book; it is\nthe name of a system of philosophy, one capable of being\nexpounded in a variety of different ways. Despite the striking\ndifferences between the earlier and later versions of his lectures on\nthe foundations of his system, Fichte always insisted that the\n\u201cspirit\u201d of the same remained unaltered\u2014a claim that\ncontinues to be challenged and debated by Fichte scholars.\n\nIn 1805 Fichte spend a semester as a professor at the University of\nErlangen, but returned to Berlin in the fall of that year. The next\nyear, 1806, he published in rapid succession three popular and\nwell-received books, all of which were based upon earlier series of\npublic lectures that he had delivered in Berlin: On the Essence of\nthe Scholar (a reworking of some of the same themes first\naddressed in the similarly titled lectures of 1794); The\nCharacteristics of the Present Age (an attempt to show the\nimplications of his \u201csystem of freedom\u201d for a speculative\nphilosophy of history); and Guide to the Blessed Life, or the\nDoctrine of Religion (an eloquent and somewhat mystically tinged\ntreatise on the relationship between transcendental philosophy and\ngenuine religion). Taken together, these three \u201cpopular\u201d\nworks are remarkable blends of speculative profundity and rhetorical\neloquence.\n\nWith the entry of the French army of occupation into Berlin in 1806,\nFichte joined the Prussian government in exile in K\u00f6nigsberg,\nwhere he delivered yet another course of lectures on the\nWissenschaftslehre and wrote an important short book on\nMachiavelli as Author (1807), which defends a form of\nRealpolitik that at least appears to contrast quite starkly\nwith the liberalism and political idealism of Fichte\u2019s earlier\npolitical writings. Fichte soon returned to occupied Berlin, however,\nwhere, in the winter of 1807/8, he delivered his celebrated\nAddresses to the German Nation (published in 1808). Though\nthese lectures later obtained a place of dubious honor as founding\ndocuments in the history of German nationalism, they are mainly\nconcerned with the issue of national identity (and particularly with\nthe relationship between language and nationality) and the question of\nnational education (which is the main topic of the work)\u2014both of\nwhich are understood by Fichte as means toward a larger, cosmopolitan\nend.\n\nFichte had always had a lively interest in pedagogical issues and\nassumed a leading role in planning the new Prussian university to be\nestablished in Berlin (though his own detailed plans for the same were\neventually rejected in favor of those put forward by Wilhelm von\nHumboldt). When the new university finally opened in 1810, Fichte was\nthe first head of the philosophical faculty as well as the first\nelected rector of the university. His final years saw no diminishment\nin the pace either of his public activity or of his philosophical\nefforts. He continued to produce new lectures on the foundations and\nfirst principles of his system, as well as new introductory lectures\non philosophy in general (\u201cLogic and Philosophy\u201d [1812]\nand \u201cThe Facts of Consciousness\u201d [1813]), political\nphilosophy (\u201cSystem of the Doctrine of Right\u201d [1812] and\n\u201cDoctrine of the State\u201d [1813]) and ethics (\u201cSystem\nof Ethical Theory\u201d [1812]). As presaged perhaps by his earlier\nbook on Machiavelli, these late forays into the domain of practical\nphilosophy betray a darker view of human nature and defend a more\nauthoritarian view of the state than anything to be found in\nFichte\u2019s earlier writings on these subject.\n\nIn 1813 Fichte canceled his lectures so that his students could enlist\nin the \u201cWar of Liberation\u201d against Napoleon, of which\nFichte himself proved to be an indirect casualty. From his wife, who\nwas serving as a volunteer nurse in a Berlin military hospital, he\ncontracted a fatal infection of which he died on January 29, 1814.\nAlmost to the moment of his death he continued his lifelong efforts to\nrethink and to re-examine the basic foundations and systematic\nimplications of his philosophy, as is rather poignantly reflected in\nthe remarkable philosophical \u201cDiary\u201d in which he recorded\nhis thoughts during this final period.\n",
