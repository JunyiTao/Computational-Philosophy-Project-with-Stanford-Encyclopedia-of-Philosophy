    "main_text": "Tarski\u2019s theory of truth || Sentences as truth-bearers\n2.1 Sentences as truth-bearers\n\nIn the classical debate on truth at the beginning of the 20th century\nwe considered in section 1, the issue of truth-bearers was of great\nsignificance. For instance, Moore and Russell\u2019s turn to the\ncorrespondence theory was driven by their views on whether there are\npropositions to be the bearers of truth. Many theories we reviewed\ntook beliefs to be the bearers of truth.\n\nIn contrast, Tarski and much of the subsequent work on truth takes\nsentences to be the primary bearers of truth. This is not an\nentirely novel development: Russell (1956) also takes truth to apply\nto sentence (which he calls \u2018propositions\u2019 in that text).\nBut whereas much of the classical debate takes the issue of the\nprimary bearers of truth to be a substantial and important\nmetaphysical one, Tarski is quite casual about it. His primary reason\nfor taking sentences as truth-bearers is convenience, and he\nexplicitly distances himself from any commitment about the\nphilosophically contentious issues surrounding other candidate\ntruth-bearers (e.g., Tarski, 1944). (Russell (1956) makes a similar\nsuggestion that sentences are the appropriate truth-bearers \u201cfor\nthe purposes of logic\u201d (p. 184), though he still takes the\nclassical metaphysical issues to be important.)\n\nWe will return to the issue of the primary bearers of truth in section\n6.1. For the moment, it will be useful to simply follow Tarski\u2019s\nlead. But it should be stressed that for this discussion, sentences\nare fully interpreted sentences, having meanings. We will\nalso assume that the sentences in question do not change their content\nacross occasions of use, i.e., that they display no\ncontext-dependence. We are taking sentences to be what Quine (1960)\ncalls \u2018eternal sentences\u2019.\n\nIn some places (e.g., Tarski, 1944), Tarski refers to his view as the\n\u2018semantic conception of truth\u2019. It is not entirely clear\njust what Tarski had in mind by this, but it is clear enough that\nTarski\u2019s theory defines truth for sentences in terms of concepts\nlike reference and satisfaction, which are intimately related to the\nbasic semantic functions of names and predicates (according to many\napproaches to semantics). For more discussion, see Wole\u0144ski\n(2001). \n",
