    "main_text": "Five Philosophical Themes || The Interpretation of Art\n3.4 The Interpretation of Art\n\nAt the most basic level of inquiry, two queries arise about\ninterpretation in art: (i) what \u2018tools\u2019 do we use to\ninterpret artworks?, and (ii) what is it we do when we interpret\nartworks? In the case of conceptual art, a satisfactory answer to (i)\nwill most probably appeal to elements such as the narrative aids\nprovided by artists or curators (e.g. catalogues, titles, exhibited\nexplanations, labels, etc.); the appropriate mode of perception (i.e.\nlooking or listening); and what we know about the artwork\u2019s and\nartist\u2019s social, historical, political or artistic context.\nDepending on the ontological status of the particular piece (if it is,\nsay, a ready-made or a performance), these elements can be combined in\ndifferent ways to explain our interpretative habits and practices.\n\nIn addressing (ii) we will most likely need to refer to the various\nmental abilities we put to use in such interpretative exercises (e.g.\nimagination, empathy); and also to ask precisely what the target of\nour interpretation is. This latter task is not as unproblematic as it\nmay seem, for it is not always clear whether it is the object itself\nthat should be under scrutiny, the object\u2019s perceptual\nproperties (and, if so, which), the idea at the heart of the work, or\nthe artist\u2019s intentions in making the piece. It seems unlikely\nthat the question will find an adequate answer until we find an\nacceptable solution to the problem mentioned above, namely \u2018Is\nthe vehicular medium a constitutive part of the conceptual artwork or\nnot, and if so how?\u2019.\n\nTwo further philosophical questions about the notion of artistic\ninterpretation take on a particularly complex dimension in relation to\nconceptual art. First, exactly what information is relevant in\nartistic interpretation? And, more importantly, to what extent should\nthe artist\u2019s intention be allowed to determine the\nappropriate interpretation? Views differ widely on this topic. In\ntheir article, \u2018The Intentional Fallacy\u2019, William Wimsatt\nand Monroe Beardsley famously argue in relation to the literary arts\nthat the only kind of evidence that is relevant to interpretation is\nthat which is internal to the work in question. (Wimsatt &\nBeardsley 1946). An artist\u2019s intention or design is of no\ninterpretative significance. Obviously, this position seems difficult\nto defend in the case of conceptual art: when we are dealing with\npieces such as Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes, where the\ninternal evidence is clearly insufficient to discern that it is an\nartwork in the first place, it seems that we need to know that Warhol\nintended the boxes to be viewed qua art, at the very\nleast.\n\nNow, even if we do wish to defend the view that the artist\u2019s\nintention needs to be taken into account somehow in the interpretation\nof conceptual art, further questions still require our attention here.\nMost centrally, should the artist\u2019s intention always be\nconsidered the decisive factor in interpretation and\nmust it always be involved? Generally speaking, there are two\nmain strands of intentionalist positions available. On the one hand,\nthere is an approach which holds that the artist\u2019s intention\ndetermines an artwork\u2019s meaning, and thus cannot be overlooked\n\u2013 or indeed superseded \u2013 in artistic interpretation (e.g.,\nCarroll 1992). On the other hand, there is a view that the interpreter\nought to construct the best hypothesis concerning the artist\u2019s\nactual intention with the help of, say, the text and biographical\nnotes, and that this hypothesis confers meaning on the work in\nquestion (e.g., Levinson 1992).\n\nAt least at a first glance, it may seem that conceptual art presents a\nstronger case for the first approach to interpretation, since the\nartist\u2019s intention is all we have to go by, quite literally, in\nworks such as Robert Barry\u2019s simple statement entitled All\nthe Things I Know But of which I am Not at the Moment Thinking\n(1969) (see, e.g., Maes 2010 and Gover 2012). Nevertheless, the\nquestion cannot be settled quite so easily, for many conceptual\nartists make a point of putting all the interpretative onus on the\nspectator. How often are we told, after all, that a specific\nartwork\u2019s meaning rests entirely in our hands; that \u2018it\nmeans whatever you want it to mean\u2019?\n\nThis leads us to the second question that is especially pertinent for\na kind of art that sets out to convey an idea or meaning, namely\nwhether there can be more than one correct or appropriate\ninterpretation of an artwork. Again, several theories present\nthemselves as eligible candidates in relation to this problem. One\nsuggestion has centred around the idea that there can be a\nmultiplicity of appropriate or correct divergent interpretations of\none and the same artwork which cannot be reduced to one underlying\ninterpretation or ranked in relation to each other (e.g., Margolis\n1991; Goldman 1990). In opposition to this view, however, another\napproach has it that there is in fact always a single best\ninterpretation which is better than any other (e.g., Beardsley 1970).\nThe aim of artistic interpretation is, then, in Matthew Kieran\u2019s\nwords, \u2018restricted to discovering the one true meaning of an\nartwork.\u2019 (Kieran 1996, 239). Whilst conceptual art certainly\nseems to rest on something like the interpretative plurality of the\nfirst view, it is not obvious how a kind of art that presents itself\nas an idea can, in reality, accommodate such indeterminacy.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that of all the questions conceptual\nart gives rise to, interpretation is the most problematic from an\ninternal point of view. The conundrum can be put in the following\nterms. If the conceptual work is the idea, it seems reasonable to\nassume that artistic interpretation will consist primarily in coming\nto understand that idea (which is conceded by the artist to the\nartwork considered as such). In other words, if we take conceptual\nart\u2019s de-materialisation claim seriously, we are left with a\nnotion of interpretation which is relatively constrained to the\nartist\u2019s intention and to the claim that that intention\ndetermines the appropriate or correct interpretation for that\nparticular work.\n\nAs we have seen, though, we are often encouraged by conceptual artists\nto take the interpretative exercise into our own hands, so to speak,\nand not be shy to use features about ourselves and our own lives as\ninterpretive tools. We are, in other words, asked to combine the idea\nof art as idea with the claim that we can, as spectators, convey an\nentirely new and fresh interpretation onto an artwork that is nothing\nbut an idea which, by definition, needs to be about or concerned with\nsomething. So, if the idea is the art, then how can my idiosyncratic\ninterpretation of that idea be anywhere near valid? It seems, then\nthat in order to be coherent, conceptual art must give up either the\nclaim that the actual artwork is nothing other than the idea, or the\nclaim that the interpretative onus lies on the viewer.\n",
