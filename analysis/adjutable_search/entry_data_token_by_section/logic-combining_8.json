Lack or excess of interaction: perplexities when combining logics\n\nUp to this point, several techniques for composing logics have been\ndescribed and exemplified. Are these processes appropriate for\ncomposing, without surprises, any pair of logics? In other words,\ngiven a pair of logics (presented in a homogeneous way), are they\ncomposable in a meaningful way? Does the composition make\nphilosophical sense? As pointed by Schurz 1991, it is conceivable that\nsome multimodal logics obtained as combination of modal logics by\nadding arbitrarily chosen bridge principles could be meaningless.\n\nFrom the technical point of view there is an important problem\nconcerning composition of logics known as collapsing problem,\nfirstly identified in Gabbay 1996b, and later formalized in del Cerro\nand Herzig 1996. In the latter paper, it is shown that, by freely\ncombining classical propositional logic and intuitionistic\npropositional logic at the semantical level (technically: by\nconstructing their unconstrained fibring in the category of\ninterpretation systems, recall\n subsection 4.3)\n the resulting logic collapses to classical logic. More precisely, the\nresulting logic will consist of two twin copies of classical\npropositional logic, having two negations, two implications and so on.\nClearly, the respective copies of each connectives will be proved to\nbe inter-derivable in the resulting logic: \\(\\neg_1 \\varphi\\) will be\nequivalent to \\(\\neg_2\\varphi\\), \\((\\varphi\\to_1 \\psi)\\) will be\nequivalent to \\((\\varphi\\to_2 \\psi)\\) and so on. The collapse only\nhappens when considering the algebraic fibring at the semantical\nlevel: in Caleiro and Ramos 2007 was shown that the collapse does not\noccur when computing the algebraic fibring of the respective Hilbert\ncalculi.\n\nBasically, the phenomenon arises because both implications collapse,\nand then intuitionistic implication becomes classic. From the\nsemantical point of view, it happens that the models of the fibred\nlogic are Heyting algebras which are simultaneously Boolean algebras:\nevidently the algebras collapse to the Boolean ones. From the point of\nview of proof theory, the problem appears as a consequence of the\nmetaproperty called Deduction Metatheorem (DMT): let\n\\(\\to_1\\) and \\(\\to_2\\) be the intuitionistic and the classical\nimplications, respectively. Then \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  & \\textrm{ iff }&  \\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\\\\n\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  & \\textrm{ iff }&  \\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_2\\psi)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n Thus, the following\nargument applies (see Gabbay 1996b): \n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi) &  \\textrm{(Axiom)}\\\\\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi),\\,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi  &  \\textrm{(DMT for } \\rightarrow_1) \\\\\n(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_2\\psi) &  \\textrm{(DMT for } \\rightarrow_2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n A similar argument\nshows that \\((\\varphi\\to_2\\psi)\\vdash(\\varphi\\to_1\\psi)\\). That is,\nclassical and intuitionistic implications collapse in the combined\nlogic.\n\nIt is worth noting that the previous arguments depart from a very\nstrong assumption: that the metaproperty DMT is preserved in the\ncombined logic. As we shall see below, this is not the case for\nalgebraic fibring, unless a stronger notion of morphism between logics\nis adopted.\n\nIn C. Sernadas et al. 2002b other examples of collapse were presented,\nand a solution to the problem was proposed by means of a controlled\nnotion of algebraic fibring called modulated fibring. An\napparently simpler solution to the collapsing problem appeared in\nCaleiro and Ramos 2007, using a variant of the algebraic fibring\ntechnique called cryptofibring. As mentioned in\n subsection 4.6,\n the graph-theoretic fibring leads to an additional solution to this\nproblem. Another solution to the collapsing problem was obtained by\nmeans of the meet combination of logics (see\n subsection 4.6).\n Given that the combined connectives inherit the common properties\nenjoyed in both logics, the interaction between the component logics\nwithin the resulting logic is minimized, which allows to overcome the\ncollapsing problem.\n\nIndependently, in Beziau 2004 it was observed that by putting together\nthe sequent rules for classical conjunction and the rules for\nclassical disjunction, the resulting sequent calculus will\n(unexpectedly) prove the distributivity between conjunction and\ndisjunction. The same phenomenon occurs if we join the (two-valued)\nvaluation clauses for classical conjunction with the valuation clauses\nfor classical disjunction. However, this is avoided by considering\nalgebraic fibring in the usual categories (Hilbert calculi or\nconsequence relations) with translations between logics as morphisms:\nthe logic obtained is the logic of lattices, which does not satisfy\ndistributivity (see Beziau and Coniglio 2005, 2011).\n\nThis situation, in which new interaction rules between the connectives\narise, is arguably undesirable. In fact, it contradicts a basic\ncriterion of fibring (and also of fusion), as expressed in Gabbay\n1999: given logic systems \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\), the\ncombination of \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) should be the\nsmallest logic system in the combined language which is a conservative\nextension of both \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\).\n\nIndeed, the distributivity problem and the collapsing problem are two\ninstances of the same phenomenon of emergence of unexpected\ninteractions (such as bridge principles) between connectives caused by\ncombination processes. In the case of combination of conjunction with\ndisjunction, the distributive law emerges: this interaction is due to\nthe combination process and appears without any apparent reason. In\nturn, the collapsing problem is a limit case of interactions: the\ninterderivability between classical and intuitionistic implication\n(nothing else than two interaction laws between different connectives)\nis also spontaneously created by the combination process.\n\nIt can be argued that the combined logics are excessively strong in\nsuch cases, because they derive too many propositions in the new\ncombined language.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposite (or dual) situation may also be\nproblematic: suppose, to help intuition, that the logic of classical\nnegation is combined with the logic of classical disjunction. These\nlogics can be presented, for instance, axiomatically (through Hilbert\ncalculi) or semantically, say, through valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)\n(that is, by means of classical truth-tables). The semantical\npresentation of the logic of classical negation consists of the set of\nall valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) satisfying the following clause:\n\n\\[v(\\neg\\varphi)=0 \\textrm{ iff } v(\\varphi)=1.\\]\n\n On the other hand, the logic of classical disjunction can\nbe characterized by the set of all valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) such\nthat: \n\n\\[v(\\varphi \\vee \\psi)=0  \\textrm{ iff } v(\\varphi)=0 \\textrm{ and  } v(\\psi)=0.\\]\n\n \n\nAs a consequence, the combined logic of negation and disjunction\n(which can be defined as the logic over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\)\ncharacterized by the valuations over \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) satisfying both\nclauses above) validates \\((\\varphi \\vee \\neg \\varphi)\\), and so\nclassical logic is recovered. This is the result obtained by the\ncombination method called direct union of matrices,\nintroduced in Coniglio and Fern\u00e1ndez 2005. However, if\nalgebraic fibring is considered in categories such as those of Hilbert\ncalculi or consequence relations, the combination between the logic of\nnegation and the logic of disjunction results in a logic defined over\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) which is weaker than classical logic: the\ninteraction law \\((\\varphi \\vee \\neg \\varphi)\\) is no longer valid.\nThat is, an arguably desirable interaction between the connectives is\nlost in the combination process, and classical logic expressed over\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) cannot be recovered from its fragments, as long\nas algebraic fibring in these categories of logics is used.\n\nAnother example of the same kind is the following: the algebraic\nfibring between the logic of classical negation \\(\\neg\\) and the logic\nof classical implication \\(\\to\\) regarded in the categories above does\nnot recover classical logic expressed over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\to\\).\nIndeed, the resulting logic system, defined over \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\to\\),\ncannot validate Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet when\npresented as an axiom: \n\n\\[\\not\\vdash(\\varphi \\to(\\neg\\varphi \\to \\psi)).\\]\n\n \n\nInterestingly enough, Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet,\npresented as a derivation, holds in the fibred logic: \n\n\\[\\varphi, \\neg\\varphi \\vdash \\psi.\\]\n\n\n\nObserve that \\((\\varphi \\to(\\neg\\varphi \\to \\psi))\\) is an interaction\nrule between the connectives of the logics being combined which cannot\nbe obtained by algebraic fibring in the categories under consideration\n(however, this principle can be recovered, e.g., by direct union of\nmatrices). If one is interested in recovering a logic from its\nfragments, this result is disappointing.\n  \nConcerning the study of the expressive power of the combination of \nfragments of classical logic mentioned above, both at the axiomatic \nlevel, as well as considered as subalgebras of the 2-valued Boolean \nalgebra, Rautenberg obtained several interesting results in Rautenberg \n1981. One of his main contributions was the proof that any 2-valued matrix \ncan be effectively axiomatized. In turn, the  question of combination \nof fragments of classical logic by fibring was additionally investigated \nin Caleiro et al 2019, based on the description of \nthe 2-valued clones made in Post 1941, on the axiomatization \nprocedures for 2-valued matrices introduced in Rautenberg 1981, and \non the results on fibring (N)matrices presented in Marcelino and \nCaleiro 2017b (see subsection 4.3). \nIn particular, the  paper studied the\nconditions under which the fibring of the Hilbert calculi of disjoint\nfragments of classical logic recovers the union of the fragments. \nSeveral examples of combinations by fibring of the logics of classical \nconnectives were analyzed, obtaining their characterizations by \n(N)matrices, as well as the additional inference rules (bridge principles) needed \nfor recovering the corresponding fragment of classical logic. Among \nseveral examples, it was shown that the fibring of two copies of the logic \nof classical conjunction collapses into the logic of a single conjunction. \nOn the other hand, neither the combination of two copies of the logic of the \nclassical negation nor the combination of two copies of  the logic of the \nclassical disjunction produces an analogous collapse: the fibring of two \ncopies of the logic of \nclassical negation is not finite-valued, but can be characterized by a \n5-valued Nmatrix; and the fibring of two copies of the logic of classical \ndisjunction cannot be characterized by a single finite-valued Nmatrix. \nBy analyzing once again the combination by fibring of the logic of \nclassical disjunction and the logic of classical conjunction (that is, \nthe least conservative extension of both logics) it was shown that the \ncombined logic cannot be characterized by a single finite-valued Nmatrix. \nThe same happens with the fibring of the logic of classical disjunction \nand the logic of classical negation, thus showing that the fibred logics \nare strictly subclassical in both cases.\n\nThese examples, as well as other along the same lines, suggest a\nproblem dual to that of collapsing and distributivity between\nconjunction and disjunction: some expected interaction laws fail to be\ncreated by some combination processes.\n\nIn such cases, it could be said that the combined logics are too weak\nbecause they are unable to derive certain intended propositions in the\nnew combined language.\n\nWhat could be expected when combining logics? Strong logics\n(guaranteeing, for instance, that a logic can be recovered from its\nfragments) or weaker ones (in which undesirable interactions between\nconnectives are blocked)?\n\nThe examples above are evidence against and in favor of both\nsituations: in order to avoid del Cerro and Herzig\u2019s collapsing problem, a careful\nsplicing process should be expected (and so the interaction between\nboth implications would disappear). On the other hand, if one wants to\nrecover, say, classical logic from some of its fragments, a more liberal\nsplicing process would be more appropriate as some intended\ninteractions between connectives of both logics would be\nrecovered.\n\nWith respect to the distributivity problem when combining conjunction\nand disjunction, the choice of method is also not determined:\ndistributivity could be a desired feature if we adopted the viewpoint\nof recovering a logic from its fragments. In this case, a combination\nmethod defining a stronger logic (such as the direct union of\nmatrices) would be more appropriate than, for instance, algebraic\nfibring of Hilbert calculi. But if, as argued in Beziau 2004,\ndistributivity is regarded as an intruder, then a more cautious\nprocess would be recommended: algebraic fibring of Hilbert calculi\nwould be more appropriate in this case. To sum up: the choice of the\nmost adequate combining process depends upon what one wants to\nobtain.\n\nAt this point, it is convenient to notice that the question about\nwhether or not interactive principles are generated when combining\nmodal logics, is intrinsically related to Hume\u2019s \u2018is-ought\nproblem\u2019 discussed in\n section 1.\n Indeed, as proven in Schurz 1991, it is possible to obtain nontrivial\n\u2018is-ought\u2019 deductions in the combination of alethic and\ndeontic logics provided that some bridge principles are allowed. The\nvalidity of bridge principles as \\(\\obcirc \\varphi \\rightarrow\n\\lozenge \\varphi\\) is nothing else than interaction rules between\nconnectives of the logics being combined. Such principles enjoy a\nsimilar conceptual status as the distributivity laws between\nconjunction and disjunction, or as the collapsing example mentioned\nabove. Thus, in order to satisfy Hume\u2019s thesis, a combination\nprocess generating logics without interactions should be preferred. On\nthe other hand, a combination process allowing the creation of\ninteractions between the connectives could grant bridge principles\nviolating Hume\u2019s thesis.\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy to observe that algebraic fibring does not\nintrinsically forbid the emergence of interactions between connectives\nof the logics being combined. In fact, the notion of morphism in the\ncategory of logic systems being employed is the key to creating or\nblocking interactions. In order to exemplify this assertion, consider\nthe case of the failure to recover classical logic from its\n\\(\\{\\neg\\}\\)-fragment and \\(\\{\\vee\\}\\)-fragment by algebraic fibring.\nFrom a proof-theoretic perspective, the key reason for this failure is that the rule \n\n\\[\n\\tag{* }\n\\frac{\\Gamma, \\varphi\\vdash \\psi \\;\\quad\\; \\Delta, \\neg\\varphi\\vdash \\psi}\n{\\Gamma, \\Delta\\vdash \\psi}\n\\]\n\n of the\nlogic of classical negation is not preserved by algebraic fibring in\ncategories of logic systems having translations between logics as\nmorphisms (recall\n subsection 4.4),\n such as the category of Hilbert calculi or consequence relations.\n\nWhen considering algebraic fibring of classical implication with\nclassical negation in those categories, the missing rule is the\nDeduction Metatheorem: \n\n\\[\\tag{**} \\frac{\\Gamma,\\varphi\\vdash\\psi}\n{\\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\to\\psi)}.\\]\n\n \n\nCategories of logic systems having logic translations as morphisms are\nsuch that the canonical injections of the coproduct are just inclusion\nmappings. Then, given two logics \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal\nL}}_2\\), the only rules of these logics which are preserved by\nalgebraic fibring are those of the form: \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi.\\]\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, suppose that we are dealing with a category of\nlogic systems in which the preservation of rules such as \\((*)\\) or\n\\((**)\\) above is required by the very notion of morphism. Thus, if a\nlogic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is obtained as a combination of two other systems\n\\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) then the rules of \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) would be faithfully transferred to\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\). This is the proposal of Coniglio 2007, in which\nalgebraic fibring in categories of sequent calculi is investigated,\ntaking into account a notion of morphism which preserves logical rules\nof the form \n\n\\[\n\\textit{If  }\\;\\; \\Gamma_1\\vdash\\varphi_1 \\;\\;\\textit{ and  \u2026  and  }\\;\\; \\Gamma_n\\vdash\\varphi_n \\;\\;\\textit{  then }\\;\\;\n\\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi.\n\\]\n\n \n\nIn such categories, when a logic system is embedded into a larger one\nby algebraic fibring, any rule as above, which can be considered as a\nmeta-theorem of the logic, is preserved by the canonical injections.\nThis is why this process is called meta-fibring. From the\ncategorial point of view, the process is the same as for algebraic\nfibring, the only difference being that the notion of morphism is\nstronger.\n\nIn Coniglio and Figallo 2015, Coniglio and Figallo extended the idea\nof meta-fibring (that is, algebraic fibring of formal sequent calculi)\nto hypersequents, which allows preserving even stronger\nmeta-properties of the logics being combined. Hypersequents, which are\nfinite multisets of ordinary sequents, constitute a natural\ngeneralization of the proof-method of sequents and turn out to be a\nsuitable tool for presenting cut-free Gentzen-type formulations for\nseveral non-classical logics.\n\nThese examples illustrate the advantages of using category theory and\ntheir tools for defining combination procedures as universal\nconstructions: the same construction (in this case, algebraic fibring)\ncan be performed in categories of logic systems with different\nfeatures obtaining, as a consequence of this, stronger or weaker logic\nsystems.\n",
