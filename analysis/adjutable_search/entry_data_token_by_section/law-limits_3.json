    "main_text": "Legal Moralism: Restrictive Factors that Can Defeat Prima Facie Wrongs || The Crime Tariff\n2.3 The Crime Tariff\n\nThe legal moralist notion of defeaters\u2014the conditions that can\npotentially defeat a prima facie reason to impose legal\ncoercion on the basis of moral wrongdoing\u2014should not be thought\nof as closed, but rather as flexible and subject to evolution or\nchange. The notion fits comfortably with an established set of\nconsiderations that have been developed since the 1960s, based on the\n\u201ccrime tariff\u201d and other mechanisms at work in the\ncriminal law (Packer 1964, 1968; Moore 1997: 664). The idea of the\ncrime tariff is that certain kinds of (perceived) wrongful behaviour\nwill be engaged in, one way or another, whether it is criminal or not.\nThat, of course, is not a conclusive objection to criminalization. If\nit were, the criminalization of murder or theft would be ruled out.\nHowever, if one looks at the predictable effects of criminalization of\ngiven wrongful conduct, it may make matters still worse than staying\nthe hand of the criminal law. For one effect of criminalization is\nthat the price of products (for example dangerous drugs) or services\n(for example sex work) will go up and will attract suppliers willing\nto break the law systematically and introduce a plethora of criminal\ngangs into societies, among other effects. The result may be worse\nthan leaving well (or quite bad) alone. Michael Moore, for example,\nwrites:\n\n\nProstitution\u2026 does not go away by being legislated against, as\nthe experience of all societies has shown. By making it criminal,\nhowever, the supply is artificially restricted to those willing to\nengage in criminal behaviour, so that prices and profits are such as\nto draw in organized criminal activity. (Moore 1997: 664; cf. Flanigan\n& Watson 2020).\n\n\nDevlin appeared to be anticipating this argument when pointing out a\nfactor that needed to be weighed in considering whether abortion\n(which he appeared to assume was morally wrongful) should be, or\nshould remain, criminal. Abortions, in certain circumstances, will be\nsought irrespective of whether the conduct is criminal. But, if\ncriminal, they will be performed by amateur, unskilled\n\u201cbackstreet\u201d practitioners, operating outside of legal\nregulation. This renders the procedure dangerous in a way it would not\nbe if properly attested professionals were undertaking the procedure;\nand punishment may seem appropriate for anyone causing or risking such\ndanger. However, the dangerousness of this conduct, said Devlin, is\n\u201clargely\u201d based on the facts that \u201cit is illegal and\ntherefore performed only by the unskilled\u201d (Devlin 1965: 24).\nThis again yields a factor of potential relevance\u2014even to those\nwho, like Devlin, believe abortion to be morally wrong. Whatever the\nconclusion, such a consideration is a factor to be weighed in the\nbalance.\n",
