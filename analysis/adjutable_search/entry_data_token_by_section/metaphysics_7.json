    "main_text": "The Problems of Metaphysics: the \u201cNew\u201d Metaphysics || Causation, Freedom and Determinism\n3.4 Causation, Freedom and Determinism\n\nQuestions about causation form yet a fourth important category of\nissues in the \u201cnew\u201d metaphysics. Of course, discussion of\ncauses go back to Ancient Philosophy, featuring prominently in\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and Physics. But\nAristotle understood \u2018cause\u2019 in a much broader sense than\nwe do today. In Aristotle\u2019s sense, a \u2018cause\u2019 or\n\u2018aiton\u2019 is an explanatory condition of an\nobject\u2014an answer to a \u201cwhy\u201d question about the\nobject. Aristotle classifies four such explanatory conditions\u2014an\nobject\u2019s form, matter, efficient cause, and teleology. An\nobject\u2019s efficient cause is the cause which explains change or\nmotion in an object. With the rise of modern physics in the\nseventeenth century, interest in efficient causal relations became\nacute, and it remains so today. And when contemporary philosophers\ndiscuss problems of causation, they typically mean this sense.\n\nOne major issue in the metaphysics of causation concerns specifying\nthe relata of causal relations. Consider a mundane claim: an iceberg\ncaused the Titanic to sink. Does the causal relation hold\nbetween two events: the event of the ship hitting the iceberg and the\nevent of the ship sinking? Or does it hold between two sets of states\nof affairs? Or does it hold between two substances, the iceberg and\nthe ship? Must causal relations be triadic or otherwise poly-adic? For\nexample, one might think that we are always required to qualify a\ncausal claim: the iceberg, rather than the captain\u2019s negligence,\nwas causally responsible for the ship\u2019s foundering. And can\nabsences feature in causal relations? For example, does it make sense\nto claim that a lack of lifeboats was the cause of a third-class\npassenger\u2019s death? Bernstein (2014) and Sartorio (2004) argue\nthat absences can be causes. Beebee (2004) suggests that absences are\ncausal explanations, but not causes.\n\nAnother question taken up by contemporary literature is whether\ncausation comes in degrees. For example: if two people lift a heavy\nplank and one person bears more of the weight, has one person\ncontributed more than the other to the lifting of the plank? Bernstein\n(2017) suggests that causation comes in degrees, but that most\nmetaphysical theories of causation cannot account for this idea.\nDemirtas (2022) and Kaiserman (2018) agree, while Sartorio (2020)\nargues that the appearance that causation comes in degrees is\nillusory, and can be explained away.\n\nWe might further ask whether causal relations are objective and\nirreducible features of reality. Hume famously doubted this,\ntheorizing that our observations of causation were nothing more than\nobservations of constant conjunction. For example, perhaps we think\nicebergs cause ships to sink only because we always observe\nship-sinking events occurring after iceberg-hitting events and not\nbecause there is a real causal relation that holds between icebergs\nand foundering ships.\n\nContemporary metaphysicians have been attracted to other kinds of\nreductive treatments of causation. Some\u2014like Stalnaker and\nLewis\u2014have argued that causal relations should be understood in\nterms of counterfactual dependencies (Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973).\nFor example, an iceberg\u2019s striking the ship caused its sinking\nat time t if and only if in the nearest possible worlds where\nthe iceberg did not strike the ship at time t, the ship did\nnot sink. Others have argued that causal relations should be\nunderstood in terms of instantiations of laws of nature. (Davidson\n(1967) and Armstrong (1997) each defend this view albeit in different\nways.) All of these theories expand on an idea from Hume\u2019s\nTreatise in attempting to reduce causation to different or\nmore fundamental categories. (For a more complete survey of recent\ntheories of causation, see Paul and Hall 2013.)\n\nDebates about causation and laws of nature further give rise to a\nrelated set of pressing philosophical questions\u2014questions of\nfreedom. In the seventeenth century, celestial mechanics gave\nphilosophers a certain picture of a way the world might be: it might\nbe a world whose future states were entirely determined by the past\nand the laws of nature (of which Newton\u2019s laws of motion and law\nof universal gravitation served as paradigms). In the nineteenth\ncentury the thesis that the world was indeed this way came to be\ncalled \u2018determinism\u2019. The problem of free will can be\nstated as a dilemma. If determinism is true, there is only one\nphysically possible future. But then how can anyone ever have acted\notherwise? For, as Carl Ginet has said (1990: 103), our freedom can\nonly be the freedom to add to the actual past; and if determinism\nholds, then there is only one way that the given\u2014the\nactual\u2014past can be \u201cadded to\u201d. But if determinism\ndoes not hold, if there are alternative physically possible futures,\nthen which one comes to pass must be a mere matter of chance. And if\nit is a mere matter of chance whether I lie or tell the truth, how can\nit be \u201cup to me\u201d whether I lie or tell the truth? Unless\nthere is something wrong with one of these two arguments, the argument\nfor the incompatibility of free will and determinism or the argument\nfor the incompatibility of free will and the falsity of determinism,\nfree will is impossible. The problem of free will may be identified\nwith the problem of discovering whether free will is\npossible\u2014and, if free will is possible, the problem of giving an\naccount of free will that displays an error in one of (or both) these\narguments.\n\nVan Inwagen (1998) defends the position that, although the modern\nproblem of free will has its origin in philosophical reflections on\nthe consequences of supposing the physical universe to be governed by\ndeterministic laws, the problem cannot be evaded by embracing a\nmetaphysic (like dualism or idealism) that supposes that agents are\nimmaterial or non-physical. This leads into our next and final sample\nof topics from the \u201cnew\u201d metaphysics.\n",
