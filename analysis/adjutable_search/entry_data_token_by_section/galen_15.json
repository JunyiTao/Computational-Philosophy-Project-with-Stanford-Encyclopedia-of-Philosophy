    "main_text": "Physical Theory and Biological Concepts || Mixture and Change\n6.3 Mixture and Change\nThe coming-to-be of different physical substances in the world, as well as their various properties, is explained through the concept of mixture (krasis). Every physical thing in the world, in particular the biological world, is composed from mixtures of the fundamental elements; it is thus appropriately described in terms of the predominance of one or more qualities (hot, cold, etc.) within the mixture. Galen holds that higher-level properties come about through the alteration that may take place in this process of mixture; at the same time, the fundamental, low-level properties\u2014hot, cold, wet and dry\u2014which predominate in a given body remain powerful explanantia of its nature, at the macroscopic, perceptible level too; and this applies, for example, both to human bodies and to the various things they may eat and drink, including both food substances and drugs.\nWe should say a little more about the nature of mixture and change. As in many areas, Galen here tries to avoid intricate and undecidable metaphysical debates, while insisting on certain fixed points. One of the latter, as we have seen, is the four-element theory; another is the understanding of the physical world as a continuum, rather than as some set of bodies interspersed with void. As to the nature of the change that takes place in mixture: krasis must be understood to be a process in which the elements involved undergo some fundamental change; it is not a mere placing alongside each other of tiny quanta of different substances (as might happen in mixing two powders), whereby those substances themselves remain in principle capable of being separated, and retain their original properties. What happens, rather, is that a new substance arises with distinct properties, and the smallest imaginable quantum of this new substance would have those distinct properties, not those of the elements from which it was mixed.\nHere Galen again draws on Stoic terminology, and talks of the \u201ctotal mixture\u201d (krasis di\u2019 hol\u014dn). In Stoic theory, this \u201ctotal mixture\u201d involves the notion that the two bodies mixed in this particular way co-inhabit one space. Galen does not commit himself on the precise metaphysical description, but seems to prefer the formulation that the qualities (poiot\u0113tes) undergo total mixture while the bodies do not.\nThis, then, is Galen\u2019s account of how a new type of substance comes about through the combination of two other substances. And here he makes the distinction between the kind of change where a substance affects another in just one or other of its qualities\u2014heating it, for example, or heating it and drying it\u2014and another, observed particularly in the assimilation of food, which involves change in respect of the whole substance (kath\u2019 hol\u0113n t\u0113n ousian, and similar expressions); the distinction is elaborated in Temp. (III.1, 270; III.4, 277; cf. Hipp. Elem. 9, 132\u20139), as well as in Galen\u2019s theoretical work on the action of drugs, SMT, III.4); at Prop. Plac. (9, 84\u20137), he talks of the \u201cspecificity\u201d or \u201cspecific quality\u201d (idiot\u0113s) of the substance considered as a whole. This specific quality, apparently, inheres in the substance, as something separate from its components. Galen here comes close to articulating a notion of emergent properties: he uses these notions of hol\u0113 ousia and idiot\u0113s not only in the context of drug properties, but also occasionally in that of the higher-level physiological capacities of the body, or even the soul, in accounts of the way in which an entity or its active capacities are qualititatively different from the underyling elements that went into its composition (Singer 2020a).\n",
