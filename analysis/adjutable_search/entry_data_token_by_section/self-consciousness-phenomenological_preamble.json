    "main_text": "\n\nFor phenomenologists, the immediate and first-personal givenness of\nexperience is accounted for in terms of a prereflective\nself-consciousness. In the most basic sense of the term,\nself-consciousness is not something that comes about the moment one\nattentively inspects or reflectively introspects one\u2019s\nexperiences, or recognizes one\u2019s specular image in the mirror,\nor refers to oneself with the use of the first-person pronoun, or\nconstructs a self-narrative. Rather, these different kinds of\nself-consciousness are to be distinguished from the prereflective\nself-consciousness which is present whenever I am living through or\nundergoing an experience, e.g., whenever I am consciously perceiving\nthe world, remembering a past event, imagining a future event,\nthinking an occurrent thought, or feeling sad or happy, thirsty or in\npain, and so forth.\n",
