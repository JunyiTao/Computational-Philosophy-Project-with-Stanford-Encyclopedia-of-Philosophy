    "main_text": "Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology || The Rise of \u201cAnalytic Theology\u201d\n2.6 The Rise of \u201cAnalytic Theology\u201d\n\nIn 2009 Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea published their edited volume\nAnalytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology.\nThe volume\u2019s contributors collectively try to make the case that\nanalytic philosophy offers a valuable and neglected resource for\nChristian theologians. A new research program developed in its wake,\nand the ensuing years have seen the rise of a self-identified school\nof \u201canalytic theologians\u201d, who use the tools and methods\nof analytic philosophy to address Christian theological topics.\n\nAt present, it is not clear whether there is any meaningful difference\nbetween Christian \u201canalytic theology\u201d and Christian\n\u201cphilosophical theology\u201d, which has been treated as a kind\nof philosophy. As the discussion above indicates, analytic\nphilosophical theology has been produced largely by Christian\nphilosophers working in philosophy departments, rather than by\ntheologians in departments of theology or divinity schools. Classic\nworks of philosophical theology like Swinburne (1994) and Adams (2000)\nseem like analytic theology avant la lettre, for example, and\nmuch recent work called \u201canalytic theology\u201d seems quite\nsimilar to previous work called \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d\nor even \u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d (e.g., Mullins 2016). Yet\nsome self-described analytic theologians have also insisted that\nChristian analytic theology is really a form of theology\n(Torrance [Alan] 2013; Torrance [Andrew] 2019; Crisp, Arcadi, &\nWessling 2019). They emphasize that Christian analytic theology is an\ninternal project of faith seeking understanding that, as theology,\nholds itself accountable to scripture and Church tradition. Yet\nwhether Christian analytic theology is properly regarded as a kind of\nphilosophy or a kind of theology depends on how we draw the underlying\ndistinction between philosophy and theology\u2014if indeed we draw\nsuch a distinction at all.\n",
