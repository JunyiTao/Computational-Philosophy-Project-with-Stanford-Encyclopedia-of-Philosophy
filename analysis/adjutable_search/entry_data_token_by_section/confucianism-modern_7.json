    "main_text": "Knowledge || The Reality of Intellectual Intuition and Free Will\n3.3 The Reality of Intellectual Intuition and Free Will\n\nMou Zongsan held similar views on the limits of science (MZCW 22: 50),\nbut as that topic was covered already, here the focus is Mou\u2019s\njustification of knowledge of the free will. His later philosophy\nfocused on demonstrating the reality of autonomy and morality, which\nhe felt Kant failed to do (Schmidt 2011). For Kant, because knowledge\nis limited to the world of appearances, free will remains something\nbeyond the bounds of human knowledge. Freedom remains a postulate, or\na mere idea, but can never be known (Kant 1785 [1997: 63], 4:459). Mou\ncriticized Kant for precisely this point and argued that Chinese\nphilosophy could provide what Kant could not: knowledge of free\nwill.\n\nAccording to Mou, Confucian philosophers also wanted to establish the\na priori conditions of morality. As in Kant, this a priori condition\nis freedom or autonomy (MZCW 5: 1.11; Lee 2017: 15). Mou concedes that\ntheoretical knowledge of the free will is not possible; however, he\ncriticizes Kant for not understanding that the truth of the free will\nhas to be grasped and known practically rather than theoretically.\nThis is what Confucianism achieved, and how it confirms that the free,\nautonomous will is a reality and not merely a postulate: it is\nrealized and verified through moral activity in the world.\n\nAutonomy for Mou requires independence from interests, inclinations,\nand external control. Morality has to be founded on a principle that\nthe will gives to itself. A will that is decided or controlled by\nanything external is not a free, autonomous will (MZCW 5: 1.136). Free\nwill cannot be an effect brought about by something else; it can only\nbe a cause (MZCW 20: 247). In addition, he writes,\n\n\nIf it requires a lower interest from something external to stimulate\nit, then it is not the fundamental heart-mind; it is not the true,\nautonomous will that gives the law to itself. (MZCW 5: 1.171)\n\n\nMorality requires the will to determine itself, free from the\ninfluence, control, or stimulation of an external object.\n\nThis describes autonomy, but is not an argument for it; for that, we\nhave to look elsewhere. One way Mou argues for the reality of autonomy\ncan be sketched out like this:\n\nAutonomy is necessary for morality to be possible.\nMorality is a reality\nTherefore, autonomy is a reality\n\n\nMou turns around Kant\u2019s argument that because we cannot know\nthat we are free, we cannot know that morality is real. We know that\nmorality is real, and therefore we know that autonomy is real (see\nFung 2021: 617\u201318; Schmidt 2011: 265). After discussing why the\nfundamental heart-mind has to be unlimited in order for morality to be\npossible, Mou gives a theoretical account of intellectual intuition\n(non-sensible intuition of the autonomous self) and says,\n\n\nIntellectual intuition must not only be affirmed theoretically, it\nmust emerge in reality\u2026. When we speak of the fundamental\nheart-mind, it is as a concrete presence, such as the feelings of\nalarm and compassion or shame and disgust that emerge at any time as\nMengzi spoke about. When it sees one\u2019s father it naturally knows\nfiliality; when it sees one\u2019s older brother it naturally knows\nbrotherly respect (these are not biological instincts, but the\nfundamental heart-mind). When it should feel alarm and compassion, it\nfeels alarm and compassion. When it should feel shame and dislike, it\nfeels shame and dislike, and so on. (MZCW 20: 249)\n\n\nThese moral responses are real presences, and they require the\nfundamental heart-mind (one of the terms Mou uses for self as a thing\nin itself, not appearance) to be possible. Kant only approached\nmorality theoretically, but Chinese philosophy makes practical\nknowledge of morality possible (Billioud 2012: 79\u201381; Tan 2009:\n559). Morality is a fact because we feel it: the moral responses are a\ndefinite presence which cannot be denied.\n\nAs knowledge through understanding requires sensible intuition,\nintellectual knowledge requires intellectual intuition: intuition of\nthings in themselves and not mere appearances. Kant attributed\nintellectual intuition only to God, denying that humans had that\ncapacity (Bunnin 2008; N. S. Chan 2011: 142). For Mou, humans have\nintellectual intuition of a limited sort, and that is how knowledge of\nthe true self (also called fundamental heart-mind or nature in itself,\nnot different from the creative power of the universe) is possible\n(Billioud 2012: 75\u201376). Intellectual intuition is\nnon-discursive, direct knowledge of the self unmediated by the\ncategories of the understanding (MZCW 10: 204). Thus, the content of\nthe intuition itself cannot be put into words, but he does say it is\nintuition of the fundamental heart-mind and humaneness in itself (MZCW\n10: 249\u201350). A moment of awareness of what is morally right is\nan instance of intellectual intuition. It is in the process of moral\nresponse that the fundamental mind intuits itself, and the mind\nbecomes aware of its own infinite moral responsiveness.\n\nMou here brings together these themes: distinguishing theoretical and\npractical knowledge, and insisting that practical (moral) knowledge\nhas to be approached in an experiential, intuitive way that focuses on\nuncovering the true self. He calls these intensional truths, in that\nthey are subject-dependent, unlike extensional truths (MZCW 29:\n19\u201327; Ro\u0161ker 2016: 118). This approach of course raises\nquestions. One problem with this intuitive method is that it can\nhardly avoid reflecting culturally learned responses and may take them\nto be a priori and necessary, believing them to be representative of\nhuman nature as a whole. Tang Junyi, for example, insists,\n\n\nFiliality should be constructed on moral reason, and this means that\nit has absolute significance. This is to say that I should be filial\neven if my parents do not love me. (TJCW 12: 43)\n\n\nPeople from other cultures might dispute that strongly. Mou also does\nnot explain how to distinguish true intellectual intuition from what\nmay feel like intellectual intuition, but not intuit its object\ncorrectly (Fung 2021: 616). Furthermore, his argument relies on\naccepting the Kantian view of morality that requires autonomy. If one\ndoes not accept that premise, this argument does not persuade.\n",
