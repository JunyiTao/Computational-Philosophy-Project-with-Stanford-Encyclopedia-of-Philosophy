    "main_text": "\n\n\nHuman embryonic stem cell (HESC) research offers much hope for\nalleviating the human suffering brought on by the ravages of disease\nand injury. HESCs are characterized by their capacity for\nself-renewal and their ability to differentiate into all types of cells\nof the body. The main goal of HESC research is to identify the\nmechanisms that govern cell differentiation and to turn HESCs into\nspecific cell types that can be used for treating debilitating and\nlife-threatening diseases and injuries.\n\n\nDespite the tremendous therapeutic promise of HESC research, the\nresearch has met with heated opposition because the harvesting of HESCs\ninvolves the destruction of the human embryo. HESCs are derived in\nvitro around the fifth day of the embryo\u2019s development\n(Thomson et al. 1998). A typical day-5 human embryo\nconsists of 200\u2013250 cells, most of which comprise the trophoblast,\nwhich is the outermost layer of the blastocyst. HESCs are harvested\nfrom the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which consists of 30\u201334\ncells. The derivation of HESC cultures requires the removal of\nthe trophoblast. This process of disaggregating the\nblastocyst\u2019s cells eliminates its potential for further\ndevelopment. Opponents of HESC research argue that the research\nis morally impermissible because it involves the unjust killing of\ninnocent human beings.\n\n\nScientists recently succeeded in converting adult human skin cells\ninto cells that appear to have the properties of HESCs by activating\nfour genes in the adult cells (Takahashi et al. 2007; Yu\net al. 2007). The reprogrammed cells\u2014\u201cinduced\npluripotent stem cells\u201d (iPSCs)\u2014could ultimately\neliminate the need for HESCs. However, at present, the consensus in\nthe scientific community is that both HESC and iPSC research should be\npursued, as we do not yet know whether iPSCs have the same potential\nas HESCs or whether it is safe to transplant them into humans. Thus,\nthe controversies around HESC research will continue, at least in the\nnear-term.\n\n\nWhile the principal source of the controversy surrounding HESC\nresearch lies in competing views about the value of human embryonic\nlife, the scope of ethical issues in HESC research is broader than the\nquestion of the ethics of destroying human embryos. It also\nencompasses questions about, among other things, whether researchers\nwho use but do not derive HESCs are complicit in the destruction of\nembryos, whether there is a moral distinction between creating embryos\nfor research purposes and creating them for reproductive ends, the\npermissibility of cloning human embryos to harvest HESCs, and the\nethics of creating human/non-human chimeras. This entry provides an\noverview of all but the last two issues just listed; cloning and\nhuman-non-human chimeras are addressed in separate entries.\n",
