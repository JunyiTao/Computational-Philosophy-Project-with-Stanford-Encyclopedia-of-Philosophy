We should distinguish two questions: (i) to\nwhat extent should non-liberal cultural and religious communities be\nexempt from the requirements of the liberal state? and, (ii) to what\nextent can they be allowed to participate in decision-making in the\nliberal state?\n\nTurning to (i), liberalism has a long history of seeking to\naccommodate religious groups that have deep objections to certain\npublic policies, such as the Quakers, Mennonites or Sikhs. The most\ndifficult issues in this regard arise in relation to children and\neducation (see Galston, 2003; Fowler, 2010; Andersson, 2011) Mill, for\nexample, writes:\n\nConsider \u2026 the case of education. Is it not almost a\nself-evident axiom, that the State should require and compel the\neducation, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is born\nits citizen? Yet who is there that is not afraid to recognize and\nassert this truth? Hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of\nthe most sacred duties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand,\nthe father), after summoning a human being into the world, to give to\nthat being an education fitting him to perform his part well in life\ntowards others and towards himself \u2026 . that to bring a child\ninto existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to\nprovide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind,\nis a moral crime, both against the unfortunate offspring and against\nsociety \u2026 . (1963, vol. 18)\n\n\nOver the last thirty years, there has been a particular case that is\nat the core of this debate \u2014 Wisconsin vs. Yoder: [406\nU.S. 205 (1972)]. In this case, the United States Supreme Court upheld\nthe right of Amish parents to avoid compulsory schooling laws and\nremove their children from school at the age of 14 \u2014 thus,\naccording to the Amish, avoiding secular influences that might\nundermine the traditional Amish way of life. Because cultural and\nreligious communities raise and educate children, they cannot be seen\nas purely voluntary opt-outs from the liberal state: they exercise\ncoercive power over children, and so basic liberal principles about\nprotecting the innocent from unjustified coercion come into play. Some\nhave maintained that liberal principles require that the state should\nintervene (against groups like the Amish) in order to [1] provide the\nchildren with an effective right of exit that would otherwise be\ndenied via a lack of education (Okin, 2002), [2] to protect the\nchildren\u2019s right to an autonomous and \u2018open future\u2019\n(Feinberg, 1980) and/or [3] to insure that children will have the\ncognitive tools to prepare them for their future role as citizens\n(Galston, 1995: p. 529; Macedo, 1995: pp. 285\u20136). Other liberal\ntheorists, on the other hand, have argued that the state should not\nintervene because it might undermine the inculcation of certain values\nthat are necessary for the continued existence of certain\ncomprehensive doctrines (Galston, 1995: p. 533; Stolzenberg, 1993: pp.\n582\u20133). Moreover, some such as Harry Brighouse (1998) have\nargued that the inculcation of liberal values through compulsory\neducation might undermine the legitimacy of liberal states because\nchildren would not (due to possible indoctrination) be free to consent\nto such institutions.\n\nQuestion (ii) \u2014 the extent to which non-liberal beliefs and\nvalues may be employed in liberal political discussion\u2014 has\nbecome the subject of sustained debate in the years following\nRawls\u2019s Political Liberalism. According to\nRawls\u2019s liberalism \u2014 and what we might call \u2018public\nreason liberalism\u2019 more generally \u2014 because our societies\nare characterized by \u2018reasonable pluralism\u2019, coercion\ncannot be justified on the basis of comprehensive moral or religious\nsystems of belief. But many friends of religion (e.g., Eberle, 2002;\nPerry, 1993) argue that this is objectionably\n\u2018exclusionary\u2019: conscientious believers are barred from\nvoting on their deepest convictions. Again liberals diverge in their\nresponses. Some such as Stephen Macedo take a pretty hard-nosed\nattitude: \u2018if some people\u2026feel \u201csilenced\u201d or\n\u201cmarginalized\u201d by the fact that some of us believe that it\nis wrong to shape basic liberties on the basis of religious or\nmetaphysical claims, I can only say \u201cgrow up!\u201d\u2019\n(2000: 35). Rawls, in contrast, seeks to be more accommodating,\nallowing that arguments based on religious comprehensive doctrines may\nenter into liberal politics on issues of basic justice \u201cprovided\nthat, in due course, we give properly public reasons to support the\nprinciples and policies that our comprehensive doctrine is said to\nsupport\u201d (1999a: 144). Thus Rawls allows the legitimacy of\nreligious-based arguments against slavery and in favor of the United\nStates civil rights movement, because ultimately such arguments were\nsupported by public reasons. Others (e.g., Greenawalt, 1995) hold that\neven this is too restrictive: it is difficult for liberals to justify\na moral prohibition on a religious citizen from voicing her view in\nliberal political debate.\n",
