    "main_text": "Religion and Prophecy\n6. Legacy\n\nWhatever the case, there is no doubt that the\nIsm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs were especially hostile to\nal-R\u0101z\u012b. Alongside Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim\nal-R\u0101z\u012b and the aforementioned Na\u1e63\u012br-e Khosraw,\nwho was also an Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b, one may mention another\nrepresentative of this group named \u1e24am\u012bd al-D\u012bn\nal-Kirm\u0101n\u012b (d. after 1020), who attacked\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s ethical teachings (\u1e24am\u012bd\nal-D\u012bn al-Kirm\u0101n\u012b, see\n HDK\n in bibliography). This is not to say that only\nIsm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b authors are critical of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b, though. Another opponent, who polemicizes against\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s cosmology and apparent belief in the\npossibility of transmigration (al-R\u0101z\u012b, RF: 174), is the\nAndalusian jurist and philosopher Ibn \u1e24azm. Also in the Western\nIslamic world, Maimonides includes a diatribe against the Razian\ntheodicy in his Guide for the Perplexed (GP: \u00a73.12).\nThough Ibn \u1e24azm associates other thinkers with\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s teachings (al-R\u0101z\u012b, RF: 170 and\n174) it does not seem that his daring ideas gained much traction among\nlater philosophers. Perhaps the most productive engagement with the\nfive eternal theory is found in Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b.\nHe gives a fair hearing to al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s account of place\nand time, and adopts a similar view on the question of time in\nparticular (Adamson and Lammer 2020).\n\nIn his primary vocation of medicine, too, al-R\u0101z\u012b had his\ncritics, including Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, his only rival for the title of\nmost influential figure in the Islamic medical tradition. In an\nepistolary exchange with al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\nsays that al-R\u0101z\u012b overreached his competence in both\nphilosophy and medicine (\u201che exceeded his abilities when lancing\nabscesses and examining urine and feces\u201d, quoted at\nal-R\u0101z\u012b, RF: 290). Al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s project in\nDoubts was also deemed presumptuous by later medical writers,\nwho composed refutations of the work. Nonetheless,\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s works were widely consulted by doctors in\nthe Islamic world, and he had a wide diffusion in the Latin speaking\nworld under the name \u201cRhazes\u201d. This began in the medieval\nperiod and persisted through the Renaissance, with sixty-seven printed\neditions of his works before 1700 (Hasse 2016: 8). No less an\nauthority than Vesalius edited an older translation of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s Book for al-Man\u1e63\u016br, and\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s medical writings were on the teaching\nsyllabus at Bologna, the most important university in Europe for\nmedical training (Siriasi 1990: 131 and 178). The independent-minded\nGirolamo Cardano, who in personality and diversity of interests was in\nsome ways the heir of Galen and al-R\u0101z\u012b, praised the latter\nas one of several doctors from the Islamic world who had improved upon\nGalenic medicine through empirical observation (experimentum)\n(Siriasi 1997: 60). More recently, al-R\u0101z\u012b has been praised\nfor his innovative approach and for breakthroughs in the history of\nmedicine, for example by investigating differential diagnosis\n(Iskandar 1962) and using a control group to test the efficacy of a\ndrug (Pormann 2008). Thus al-R\u0101z\u012b the doctor has had a more\nillustrious posthumous career than al-R\u0101z\u012b the\nphilosopher.\n",
