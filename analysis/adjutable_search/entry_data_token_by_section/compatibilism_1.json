    "main_text": "Free Will and the Problem of Causal Determinism || Determinism and Alternative Possibilities\n1.1 Determinism and Alternative Possibilities\n\nA natural way to think of an agent\u2019s control over her conduct at\na moment in time is in terms of her ability to select among, or choose\nbetween, alternative courses of action. This picture of control stems\nfrom common features of our perspectives as practical deliberators\nsettling on courses of action. If a person is choosing between voting\nfor Clinton as opposed to Trump, it is plausible to assume that her\nfreedom with regard to her voting consists, at least partially, in her\nability to choose between these two alternatives. On this account,\nacting with free will requires alternative possibilities. A\nnatural way to model this account of free will is in terms of an\nagent\u2019s future as a garden of forking paths branching off from a\nsingle past. A locus of freely willed action arises when the present\noffers, from an agent\u2019s (singular) past, more than one path into\nthe future. On this model of human agency, then, when a person acts of\nher own free will, she could have acted otherwise.\n\nThis conception of free will immediately invites the thought that\ndeterminism might be a threat. For determinism, understood in the\nstrict sense characterized above, tells us that, at any time, given\nthe facts of the past and the laws of nature, only one future\nis possible. But according to the conception of human agency under\nconsideration, a freely willing agent could have acted other than she\ndid and, hence, that more than one future is possible.\n\nHere is an incompatibilist argument that codifies the considerations\nset out above:\n\nAny agent, x, performs an act a of\nx\u2019s own free will iff x has control over\na.\nx has control over a only if x has the\nability to select among alternative courses of action to act\na.\nIf x has the ability to select among alternative courses\nof action to act a, then there are alternative courses of\naction to act a open to x (i.e., x could\nhave done otherwise than a).\nIf determinism is true, then only one future is possible holding\nfixed the actual past and the laws of nature.\nIf only one future is possible holding fixed the actual past and\nthe laws of nature, then there are no alternative courses of action to\nany act open to x (i.e., x could not have done\notherwise than she actually does).\nTherefore, if determinism is true, it is not the case that any\nagent, x, performs any act, a, of her own free\nwill.\n\n\nFor ease of reference and discussion throughout this entry, let us\nsimplify the above argument as follows:\n\nIf someone acts of her own free will, then she could have done\notherwise. (A \u2013 C)\nIf determinism is true, no one can do otherwise than one actually\ndoes. (D \u2013 E)\nTherefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free\nwill (F).\n\n\nCall this simplified argument the Classical Incompatibilist\nArgument. According to the argument, if determinism is true, no\none has access to alternatives of the sort you might plausibly think\nto be required for free will.\n",
