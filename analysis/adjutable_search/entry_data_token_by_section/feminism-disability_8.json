    "main_text": "Applications || Caregiving\n7.1 Caregiving\n\n\nWomen are more likely to remain in relationships with ill or\ndisabled dependents\u2014partners, children, or elders\u2014than are men\n(Cohen 1996). Possibly, fewer men than women consider caregiving as a\nself-affirming role. Women therefore contribute a very large proportion\nof society's caregiving, but may be harmfully confined and\ndisadvantaged by this role unless their contributions as carers are\nadequately acknowledged, appreciated and compensated. Emphasized\nin feminist literature and by the women's movement, this issue is\na touchstone for many feminist philosophers in judging the adequacy of\nmoral and political theories.\n\n\nAnalyses and assessments of the moral dimensions of how caregivers\nrelate to dependent disabled individuals, as well as to disabled people\nwho do not need extraordinary levels of care, would benefit from\nnuanced collaboration attention by feminist and disability\nscholars. Even where helping relationships are voluntary, they\nrisk being asymmetrically so, with the dependent feeling coerced into\nreceiving assistance in the proffered rather than in a preferred form,\nor the dependency worker feeling imprisoned by the relationship.\nHelp-givers choose how they will help, but help-takers cannot choose\nhow they will be helped, for if one's connection to others is as the\nrecipient of help, rejecting others' choice of proffered help leaves\none solitary (Silvers 1995). Joan Tronto finds that the power\nimbalance between care givers and care receivers carries with it a\npotential for oppression (Tronto 1987; Tronto 1993).\n\n\n\nNussbaum rightly observes that we must preserve the self-respect of\ndependents without exploiting caregivers. Morris argues that the\nsolution lies in eliminating the presumptions about normate embodiment\nand normal functioning that now pervade the way caregivers and care\nreceivers usually are conceptualized by ethics of care.  Proponents of\nthe ethics of care could profit from recognizing that many disabled\npeople, men as well as women, are caregivers for themselves and\ntherefore are crucially positioned to understand how giving care best\nconnects to receiving it (Morris 2001). Working out better\nunderstanding of the moral, political, and social dimensions of\ncaregiving relationships is of crucial importance not only to disabled\npeople themselves, but also to families who are as dependent on\nsecuring care for their dependent members as their dependents are on\nthem.\n",
