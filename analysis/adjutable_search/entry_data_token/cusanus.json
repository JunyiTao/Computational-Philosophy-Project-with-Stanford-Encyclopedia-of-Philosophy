Biography\n\nNicholas of Cusa (Nikolaus Cryfftz or Krebs in German, then Nicolaus\nCusanus in Latin) was born in 1401 in Kues (now Bernkastel-Kues) on\nthe Moselle River between Koblenz and Trier. He was one of four\nchildren in a bourgeois family. His father, Johan Cryfftz, was a\nprosperous merchant who became one of the landed gentry in Trier. The\nfirst record we have of Nicholas\u2019 early education comes from his\nstudy of the liberal arts at University of Heidelburg in\n1416\u201317. He then moved to the University of Padua where he\nstudied canon law, receiving his Doctor of Canon Law in 1423. In Padua\nhe met the physician and mathematician Paolo Toscanelli, the canonist\nGiuliano Caesarini, and the humanists Guarino da Verona and Vittorino\nda Feltre.\n\nIn 1425 he entered the service of the archbishop of Trier and, as his\nsecretary, received income from several benefices. By 1426 he was in\nCologne where he may have lectured on canon law, studied philosophy\nand theology, and began researches into original source material and\ninto the annals of German law. There he was able to prove that the\nDonation of Constantine was an eighth-century forgery, and he found\nmanuscripts of Pliny\u2019s Natural History and of\nPlautus\u2019 comedies. In Cologne he met Heimerich of Campo, who\nintroduced him to the writings of Ramon Llull, Albert the Great and\nhis commentary on Dionysius, and Proclus\u2019 commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides. In 1428 and 1435 Nicholas was\noffered positions teaching canon law at the University of Louvain, but\nhe turned them down to remain in church administration.\n\nOrdained a priest sometime during the 1430s, Nicholas first gained\nwider notice for his work as a conciliarist at the Council of Basel.\nThere he wrote De concordantia catholica (1433), arguing for\nthe authority of the council over that of the pope and stressing the\nnotions of consent and representation. After the turmoil at Basel\nsplit the council, Nicholas ultimately sided with the papal party and\nleft the conciliarists. In 1437 he was part of an embassy sent to\nConstantinople to seek reconciliation of the Greek Church with Rome.\nHe reported that, during the voyage home, the insights of De docta\nignorantia (1440) came to him as a kind of divine revelation. He\ncontinued as a papal legate to Germany from 1438\u201348. Named\ncardinal in 1446 by Eugenius IV, Cusanus was elevated to that position\nin 1448 by Nicholas V and was sent to Germany in 1451 as papal legate\nto reform the church.\n\nNicholas\u2019 most important philosophical works were written in the\ntwenty-four years between the appearance of De docta\nignorantia and his death. De coniecturis\n(1442\u201343), De dato patris luminum (1445), Apologia\ndoctae ignorantiae (1449), Idiota de sapientia, Idiota de\nmente, Idiota de staticis experimentis (all 1450) were among\nimportant works of the decade from 1440\u20131450, as were many\nsermons and works on mathematics. The final fourteen years of his life\nsaw the appearance of De visione Dei (1453), De\nberyllo (1458), De possest (1460), De li non\naliud (1461), De ludo globi (1462\u201363), De\nvenatione sapientiae (1462), Compendium (1464) and\nDe apice theoriae (1464), more works on mathematics and many\nmore sermons. Of particular note are two works he wrote during these\nyears that reached out to other religions, especially Islam, De\nPace Fidei (1453) and Cribatio Alchorani (1461).\n\nIn 1450 he was named bishop of Brixen in the Tirol. In 1452 he began\nactive administration in Brixen, but his attempts at reform led to\nthreats and clashes with Sigismund, the count of Tirol. Many of his\nover two hundred sermons date from this time in Brixen, though his\nreform efforts there and earlier in Germany mostly failed. Nicholas\nfinally retreated from the conflict in Brixen to Rome, where he\nremained in the papal curia advising Pius II. He died in 1464 in Todi\non his way from Rome to Ancona. His remains were buried in his titular\nChurch, St Peter in Chains, at Rome; his heart was sent to Kues and\nburied in the chapel of the hospice for elderly men there that he\nendowed in his will. The hospice survives and his remarkable library\nis housed there today.\n2. Nicholas\u2019 Thought\n\nNicholas of Cusa may arguably be best understood as employing a\nChristian Neoplatonic framework to construct his own synthesis of\ninherited ideas. His thought witnesses to his own reading in a variety\nof predecessors, while side-stepping the methods of the medieval\nscholastic summae and their typical controversies and\narguments. Trained as a canon lawyer, Nicholas is mostly self-taught\nin theology and philosophy; both his ideas and his language may\npresent some difficulties to contemporary readers. His thought has to\nbe viewed as a whole, for it works more by correspondences and\nparallels between the domains he is interested in expounding than in a\nlinear fashion or by direct argument. What is noteworthy are the\nflexible metaphors he uses as he moves across what we designate today\nas ontology, philosophy of mind and epistemology, and philosophical\ntheology. His metaphors provide some methodological clue to\nunderstanding how Nicholas proposes that we should think God and\ncreatures together. It is not just that God exceeds our conceptual\nreach and grasp as well as our literal language. The asymmetry between\nGod and creatures also provides a measure or norm for the\nappropriateness of any metaphor exploring or attempting to explain\ntheir relationship.\n2.1 Metaphysics and ontology\n\nNicholas of Cusa\u2019s most complete set of proposals about what is\nreal occurs in his best-known work of 1440, De docta\nignorantia: On Learned Ignorance. Here Cusanus addresses\nthe four categorical realities traditionally found in Christian\nthought: God, the natural universe, Christ and human beings. On\nLearned Ignorance devotes its first book to God, the second to\nthe universe and a third to the God-man, Jesus Christ. While its order\nmirrors the outflow from God and return to him, this book does not\ndistinguish philosophy and theology as contemporary thinkers might,\nbut unites them in a single overview of Neoplatonic Christian\nreality.\n\nNicholas begins with a single trope or symbol to lay out the parallels\nbetween his teachings in the three books, that of the\n\u201cmaximum.\u201d God is the absolute Maximum; the universe is a\ncreated image of God, the \u201ccontracted\u201d or restricted\nmaximum. Christ unites the first two as the Maximum at once\nabsolute-and-contracted. \u201cContraction\u201d is a metaphor for\nthe finite status of creatures, all of whom are limited images of God.\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d is used in its etymological sense of\n\u201cfree from\u201d (ab-solutus) to characterize\nGod\u2019s infinity. As absolute maximum God is both unlimited and\ntranscendent, unreachable by human conceptions that measure the\nlimited or contracted realm of more and less. Once Cusanus\nconceptualizes human knowing as measuring, he proposes that our\nknowledge also cannot measure exactly the essence of any limited\nthing. A fortiori, when it comes to the unlimited God, Nicholas\nasserts that \u201cthere is no proportion between finite and\ninfinite.\u201d The infinite God remains beyond our ken. Human\nefforts to understand the depth and implications of this assertion are\nwhat will render our ignorance \u201clearn-ed.\u201d\n\nAs so often in Christian thinking, this sort of apophatic preamble\ndoes not prevent Cusanus from spending a whole book proposing how we\nmight comprehend the incomprehensible God\n\u201cincomprehensibly.\u201d His first proposal is that God is the\n\u201ccoincidence of opposites.\u201d This turns out to be a way\nboth of recalling the negative theology to be found in Dionysius the\nAreopagite and his other predecessors and at the same time of going\nbeyond it. Put in the language of the \u201cmaximum,\u201d in God\nboth maximum and minimum coincide in the divine infinite Oneness, for\nboth take the mind beyond the measurable created domain of more and\nless and end up meaning just the \u201csuperlative\u201d or\ntranscendent. The implication, in other words, is that God\u2019s\nreality lies beyond any familiar domain where the principle of\ncontradiction holds sway.\n\nAt the same time this \u201ccoincidence\u201d underlines the divine\nOneness that comprehends all else in undifferentiated and unlimited\nunity. It is not that creatures coincide with God or God with\ncreatures, but that in God all else coincides as nothing else than\nGod. As so often in negative and apophatic \u201ctheology,\u201d we\nare not only told what God is not but led to reflect explicitly on\nwhat God must be, even if we have no conceptual clarity about what we\nassert. The result is a kind of second-order language about the ways\nin which we are forced to think and talk about divinity.\n\nNicholas then proposes some geometrical \u201cexercises\u201d to\nprovide his readers some object lessons designed to teach how we might\nreach for the unlimited even while we are aware that we cannot grasp\nwhat the infinite God may be. For instance, we are to imagine a circle\nand a straight line or tangent that meets the circle. From a certain\nperspective, as the diameter or circumference of the circle increases,\nits circumference approaches the straight line and appears less and\nless curved. If we then imagine and extrapolate the circumference to\nthe infinite, we can almost \u201csee\u201d that both straight\ntangent and curved circumference should coincide\u2014a kind of\n\u201ccoincidence of opposites\u201d that is a figure of how we may\nthink beyond limited things toward the transcendent One. All this is\nmathematically impossible, of course, but it demonstrates some\nmetaphorical steps for moving beyond the finite toward the infinite\nthat might be transferred from geometrical figures to created beings\nand their Creator.\n\nIn Book II of On Learned Ignorance Cusanus deals with the\ncreated universe. The natural universe counts as the limited or\ncontracted maximum that is the image of the absolute Maximum. Here\nNicholas introduces another central metaphor to capture the\nrelationship between God and creatures, the metaphor of enfolding and\nunfolding (complicatio/explicatio). He expands the\n\u201cfolding\u201d metaphor he inherited from the twelfth-century\nschool of Chartres. While all beings are \u201cenfolded\u201d in the\nundifferentiated oneness of their Divine Source, they are at the same\ntime an \u201cunfolding\u201d of God in time and space.\n\u201cInsofar as He is the unfolding,\u201d Nicholas writes,\n\u201cin all things He is that which they are, just as in an image\nthe reality itself [veritas] is present\u201d (II.3, Hopkins\ntranslation). In Neoplatonic terms, one must think the unfolded\nuniverse we experience and all that is real in it as at once enfolded\nin the Creator on whom it depends. God encompasses every thing created\nin a dialectical outflow and return to God without any creatures ever\nbeing identified with the God on whom they depend, that One who\nremains both present to them yet ever absent and beyond. What the\n\u201cunfolding/enfolding\u201d couple captures is the dynamic\nrelationship between divine Original and created image.\n\nThe natural universe, then, is the whole or contracted maximum\ncollectively constituted by the many beings in space and time.\nNicholas proposes the quasi-Anaxagorean slogan that \u201ceach thing\nis in each thing: quodlibet in quolibet\u201d to emphasize\nthat the individual beings or parts are no less\n\u201ccontracted\u201d images of the whole created universe. Just as\nGod is present to each creature that stands as a contracted image of\nthe divine, so the universe as a macrocosm is present to each creature\nor constitutive part as microcosm. In that way, each natural thing is\nan image of the collective whole. But since this collectivity is made\nup of interrelated parts, each thing is also the totality of its\nconnections with everything else. \u201cEach thing is in each\nthing\u201d because each is an image reflecting the oneness of the\nwhole and thus of all other individuals that are the interrelated\nparts of that whole.\n\nNicholas also recognizes in Book Two that the natural universe is\ncharacterized by change or motion; it is not static in time and space.\nBut finite change and motion, ontologically speaking, are also matters\nof more and less and have no fixed maximum or minimum. This\n\u201contological relativity\u201d leads Cusanus to some remarkable\nconclusions about the earth and the physical universe, based not on\nempirical observation but on metaphysical grounds. The earth is not\nfixed in place at some given point because nothing is utterly at rest;\nnor can it be the exact physical center of the natural universe, even\nif it seems nearer the center than \u201cthe fixed stars.\u201d\nBecause the universe is in motion without fixed center or boundaries,\nnone of the spheres of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic world picture\nare exactly spherical. None of them has an exact center, and the\n\u201coutermost sphere\u201d is not a boundary. The universe is\ntherefore \u201cinfinite,\u201d in the sense of physically\nunbounded. Cusanus thus shifts the typical medieval picture of the\ncreated universe toward later views, but on ontological grounds.\n\nFor Nicholas, the exact center and circumference of the created\nuniverse are to be found only in God. What we take to be\ncenter and outer limits depends on our viewpoint. If we change\nperspectives, say to that from another planet (which might indeed be\ninhabited) and take it to be center, then earth might be zenith. In\nthis way we come to realize that what is taken as fixed or central can\nbe altered to be moving and at the zenith, depending on the location\nof the standpoint we pick in the unbounded universe. The reason,\nCusanus writes, is that there is no exactness outside of God, and only\n\u201cGod, who is everywhere and nowhere, is its [the\nuniverse\u2019s] circumference and center\u201d (II.12, Hopkins\ntranslation).\n\nIn this way learned ignorance recognizes that the natural universe\nitself, as a contracted image of God, has a physical center that can\nbe anywhere and a circumference that is nowhere. That is why Nicholas\ncharacterized the natural universe as a contracted maximum or\n\u201cprivative\u201d infinite while God remains the\n\u201cnegative\u201d infinite or absolute maximum. This means that\nthe universe merely lacks set physical bounds or limits, while God has\nno ontological limits in being all that can possibly be. This enables\nthe \u201cinfinite\u201d universe, as the whole constituted by all\ncreatures, to be an image of the divine oneness, but only in a\ncontracted or attenuated fashion.\n\nNowhere is the Christian bearing of On Learned Ignorance more\nobvious than in Book III, where Nicholas treats of the God-man, Jesus\nChrist, as a third \u201cmaximum,\u201d the Maximum at once\nabsolute-and-contracted. Once again, however, Cusanus uses the\northodox teaching of early Christian councils such as Chalcedon more\nas a background guide than as providing a straightforward Christology\nor text for exposition. He returns to the contrast between absolute\nGod and contracted creatures that he used throughout Books I and II to\ninterpret and contrast the relation between infinite God and finite\ncreatures, even though there is no real proportion between them.\n\nGod was construed as the absolute maximum and divine infinite Oneness,\nwhile Nicholas viewed the natural universe as a contracted maximum\nwhose unity-in-multiplicity and lack of physical limits\n\u201creflected\u201d God\u2019s positively unlimited oneness.\nNicholas now entertains a third possibility, an anomalous joining of\nabsolute and contracted in the God-man. He reviews, borrowing from\nAristotle, the ordered universe of things belonging to natural types\n(genera and species), then modifies it by extending to individuals his\nidea of contraction or limitation. Individual specimens are all that\nexist, but not only are they contracted images of God\u2019s oneness,\nbut also contracted images of their types insofar as each more or less\nfulfills the possibilities of its nature.\n\nCusanus thereupon asks a hypothetical question. What would happen were\na perfect specimen, an individual fulfillment of its type, to actually\nexist? In his language of maximality, it would be another maximum\ncontracted to a unique individual of a given kind. But what would make\nsuch a maximum individual possible in a universe of more or less? Only\nits unique union with God, the absolute divine Maximum that is the\nsource of every contracted reality, a union signaled in the\ntraditional \u201chypostatic union.\u201d The whole of this maximal\nyet finite human nature is created and united with the absolute God so\nthat God remains transcendent, yet inseparable from this one human\ncreature. In terms of enfolding and unfolding, this unique unfolding\nin a human being is at the same time to reveal the God enfolding Jesus\nChrist. Jesus is an image of God so utterly transparent as to remain\nopaque except to the eyes of faith.\n\nCusanus relies on the traditional microcosm/macrocosm trope to explain\nwhy human nature would be the contracted nature best suited for union\nwith the divine Absolute. Human nature is the created nature\n\u201cmore common to the totality of beings\u201d (III.3, Hopkins\ntranslation) because the intermediate status of human beings between\nangels and all other bodily creatures provides common ties to the\nwhole range of created things. These ties are based on its capacities\nas \u201cwhat is highest of the lower and what is lowest of the\nhigher\u201d natures (ibid.), so that it stands as\nrepresentative microcosm of the created macrocosm. The upshot is that\nthe historical Jesus Christ is human in such a way as to be divine\nand divine in such a way as to be human, the Maximum at once\ncontracted and absolute, the human image who is\nsimultaneously the divine Original. Because the divine Word is one\nwith Jesus\u2019 human nature, that nature is perfect of its kind, at\nthe same time contracted and maximal. Learned ignorance may thus press\nthe Cusan metaphors and ideas to the limit in dealing with Jesus\nChrist, because the hypostatic oneness of the incarnate God will\nalways elude full human understanding.\n\nThis third book realigns the order of Christian metaphysics so that\nthe God-man stands between God and the rest of creation, for it is\nthrough the mediation of the Incarnate Word that creatures are made\nand creatures return to their source. In Book I, Nicholas proposed\nthat there is no proportion or measure between the infinite and the\nfinite that will enable us to grasp the Infinite God or even\nGod\u2019s contracted image in the natural universe. This is what\nlearned ignorance establishes for and contributes to human wisdom. Yet\nthe historic reality of Jesus Christ has a theoretical role to play in\ninterpreting Nicholas\u2019 metaphysical vision. The Cusan Christ\nstands as a more adequate norm and measure for theory and practice.\nJesus Christ is the historical human image of the Absolute One beyond\nour ken and thus the paradigm that reveals our creaturely connection\nwith the infinite God. Christ is the disclosure in time of what God\nis. In this way learned ignorance points to Jesus Christ as the\nmedium, the measure and mediator between finite and infinite,\nand, as well, the concrete norm for what human beings may become.\n\nThe three books of On Learned Ignorance thus represent a\nseries of powerful proposals for reinterpreting Christian reality.\nThroughout Nicholas uses metaphors such as the coincidence of\nopposites, absolute/contracted and enfolding/unfolding to relate God\nand creation. His proposals are established by seeking out parallels\nbetween the infinite divine Original and limited created images and by\ndrawing out the implications of these parallels. This book is neither\nmedieval Aristotelian scholastic disputation nor later Cartesian\nrationalism, but its own kind of Christian Neoplatonic speculation\nthat teases the philosophical imagination as much as it may frustrate\nany contemporary philosophical search for arguments or proofs. It is\nthe coherence of the parallels or correspondences within the overall\nview of reality that gives Cusan metaphysics and Cusan metaphors their\npersuasive power.\n2.2 The Mind and Human Knowing\n\nNicholas of Cusa does not neatly divide ontology from epistemology any\nmore than he separates faith and reason, so it seems fitting that his\nideas on human knowing emphasize the metaphor of mind as measure\n(mens/mensura) already mentioned in On Learned\nIgnorance. This becomes the significant way that human minds are\nimages of the divine mind. In his 1450 dialogue, Idiota de mente:\nThe Layman: About Mind, the first \u201cdefinition\u201d\nproposed for mind may fit the divine mind better than the human:\n\u201cMind is the limit and measure of all things\u201d (c.1).\nCusanus proceeds to employ the quasi-technical metaphor from On\nLearned Ignorance,\n\u201cenfolding/unfolding\u2014complicatio/explicatio,\u201d\nto spell out just how our minds are images of God\u2019s mind. These\nmoves already separate his ideas about human knowing from those of\nboth his scholastic predecessors and his post-Renaissance successors.\nHe writes:\n\nYou know how the divine Simplicity enfolds all things. Mind is the\nimage of this enfolding Simplicity. If, then, you called this divine\nSimplicity infinite Mind, it will be the exemplar of our mind. If you\ncalled the divine mind the totality of the truth of things, you will\ncall our mind the totality of the assimilation of things, so that it\nmay be a totality of ideas. In the divine Mind conception is the\nproduction of things; in our mind conception is the knowledge of\nthings. If the divine Mind is absolute Being, then its conception is\nthe creation of beings; and conception in the human mind is the\nassimilation of beings. (c.3)\n\n\nThis extension of the metaphor used in metaphysics to capture how\nthings simultaneously proceed from and return to God spells out where\nhuman knowledge stands. God\u2019s utterly simple divine mind enfolds\nthe true natures of all the actual things \u201cunfolded\u201d from\nit in the created universe. The human mind is a parallel though\nlimited oneness that can enfold or encompass the concepts of all it\nknows while unfolding them in a conceptual universe. While divine\nknowing amounts to the creating of beings, human knowing amounts to\nthe creating of concepts that are \u201cthe assimilation of\nbeings.\u201d The idiota/layman continues:\n\nWhat suits the divine Mind as infinite Truth suits our mind as its\nclose image. If all things are in the divine Mind as in their exact\nand proper Truth, all things are in our mind as in the image or\nlikeness of their proper Truth, that is, as known; for knowledge takes\nplace by likeness. All things are in God, but there as exemplars of\nthings. All things are in our mind, but there as likenesses of things.\n(c.3)\n\n\nTwo points here are essential. First, the conceptual content of our\nknowledge is tied to the things God created as to their epistemic\nlikenesses. Nicholas thus stands in the tradition of Christian\nrealism. Second, the correspondences between divine mind and human\nmind are severely modified by the fact that God\u2019s purported\n\u201cconcepts,\u201d the \u201cexemplars\u201d of things, are\nreally nothing else in God but God\u2019s undifferentiated oneness.\nOneness is primary in God\u2019s knowledge, \u201cmanyness\u201d\nand \u201cotherness\u201d characterize our conceptual domain. At\nbest we humans are unitary sources of our own knowledge and can give\nour ideas an overall oneness as a more or less organized whole\u2014a\nquite imperfect and faint mirroring of God\u2019s mind.\n2.2.1 Human Knowing is Conjecturing\n\nNicholas\u2019 second major treatise (1442\u201343) that again\nexplains his vision of all there is in Neoplatonic Christian terms is\nentitled De coniecturis: On Conjectures. Here he employs the\ncontrasting terms of unitas/alteritas: oneness/otherness, as\nwell as enfolding/unfolding to propose how we might understand from a\nsomewhat different viewpoint God, the universe and human beings.\nOneness is characteristic of God, while otherness stands for the\ncontingent plurality and variety of limited created things. In this\nwork Nicholas also introduces an explicit contrast between the human\ncapacities of ratio and intellectus. Ratio\nor discursive reason is our capacity for thinking, using concepts and\njudgments. Intellectus, by contrast, is a direct intellectual\nvision. Nicholas parallels the way our plural capacities for reason,\nimagination and sensation are founded in \u201cintellectus\u201d as\ntheir single source to the simultaneous outflow and return of the\nplurality of creatures to their single divine Source. (Ratio\nand intellectus may recall in some ways dianoia and\nnoesis in Plato\u2019s famous image of the divided\nline.)\n\nThe title, On Conjectures, is also intriguing because here\nCusanus makes explicit the limits of human knowing only hinted at in\nOn Learned Ignorance and in his later The Layman: On\nMind. As his Prologue puts it, \u201cYou have seen that the\nexactness of truth cannot be attained. The consequence is that every\npositive human assertion of the truth is a conjecture\u2026. And so\nthe unattainable Oneness of truth is known in conjectural otherness\nand the conjecture of otherness is itself known in the most simple\nOneness of truth.\u201d Here the Neoplatonic dialectical principle\nthat insists we never think anything apart from the First is applied\neven to human knowing. And such knowing is conjecturing.\n\nCusan \u201cconjecture\u201d is not to be taken as what we normally\nmean by the word in contemporary English where it covers the range\nfrom a guess or hunch to a typical surmise to a provisional proposal\nto be investigated or checked against usually empirical evidence.\nNicholas only considers \u201ctrue\u201d conjectures and believes\nthat our conceptual and judgmental knowledge is conjectural or\nprovisional because human reason never grasps the essence of anything\nprecisely as it is. This does not mean we cannot improve our\nunderstanding or that we are simply making things up; rather, it\nfollows from the fact that our knowledge is a likeness of actual\nthings and real characteristics whose complete and \u201ctrue\u201d\nnatures are only known to their Creator. To quote the Prologue again,\n\u201cwhile our actual knowledge is incommensurable with the greatest\nknowledge, something humanly unattainable, the unsure falling away of\nour weak apprehension from the purity of truth makes our assertions of\nwhat is true conjecture.\u201d\n\nNicholas composed On Conjectures as a letter treatise\naddressed to Cardinal Cesarini. In chapter 11 of Book One he proposes\na scenario where the cardinal views the pope. This scenario leads into\nhis sole explicit description of coniectura. This example of\nvisual perception lets us recognize that we readily make perceptual\nassertions about what we see or hear. And when we reflect on these\nperceptual judgments we realize that we go beyond what sensation alone\ndelivers, for we use reason to interpret and make sense of what we\nsee. Reason and sense operate inseparably in our perceptual\nexperience. Reason discriminates, recognizes and may explicitly\nformulate in language or thought what the experience comes to, for\ninstance, \u201cThere\u2019s the pope.\u201d\n\nFurther reflection enables us to realize that what visual perception\ndelivers is limited, that is, partial and perspectival, because our\nperceptual judgments reflect at least the constraints of the\nperceiver\u2019s bodiliness. These constraints include what physical\neyes can see, as well as one\u2019s physical location and viewpoint.\nNicholas terms this a twofold \u201cotherness\u201d that conditions\nand limits all sensory perception, limitations that we are implicitly\naware of in making perceptual judgments. So Nicholas\u2019\ndescription of coniectura reflects the\n\u201cotherness\u201d of our finite human estate. As he writes,\n\u201cA conjecture, then, is a positive assertion that participates\nin truth as it is, but in otherness.\u201d (Bk. I, c. 11)\n\u201cTruth as it is\u201d refers, of course, to what is enfolded in\nthe divine Mind. What is unfolded in our concepts and assertions\nshares that truth but only approximately, \u201cin\notherness.\u201d\n\nTwo other sources of \u201cotherness\u201d besides bodiliness\nunderlie the limitations on perceptual knowledge. One is the fact that\nthe objects of perception are themselves limited. The cardinal\u2019s\nsight of the pope has to be conjectural because anything extended can\nshow, as it were, but one side of itself to another embodied viewer. A\nsecond \u201cotherness\u201d in perception is due to the\n\u201cotherness\u201d of the mental and linguistic signs, images,\nand symbols we use to think and talk about what we perceive. These\ndiffer from both our mental capacities and what we are looking at or\nlistening to. This means the terms in which perceptual judgments are\nexpressed reflect the broader historical background and interests of\nthe perceiver as well as his or her linguistic community.\n\nGiven all these constraints we may wonder why Nicholas believes that\nconjectural knowledge \u201cparticipates in the truth as it\nis.\u201d Fundamentally, he is convinced that our status as images of\nGod\u2019s mind and its oneness secures the cognitive validity of\nwhat we know. Our knowledge is \u201cconjectural\u201d in contrast\nto God\u2019s knowledge, for divine knowledge is complete and exact,\nboth aperspectival and omniperspectival, where knower and known\ncoincide in infinite Oneness. Our recognition of the limits in our own\nknowing and its contents can keep us in touch, at least implicitly,\nwith what is beyond our ken in that ideal oneness of knower and known.\nThe separation of the human mind from the universe of knowable things\nis at the same time a connection that results in conjectural\nknowledge. Just so, conjectural knowledge is also an outcome of the\nseparation and connection of the human mind and the divine Mind, of\nimage and Original.\n2.2.2 Knowing as Assimilative Measuring\n\nRecall once more the Cusan \u201cdefinition\u201d of mind already\nalluded to in The Layman: About Mind: Mind is \u201cthat\nfrom which comes the limit and measure of all things.\u201d (c.1) If\nwe set this beside the comment quoted above that \u201cconception in\nthe human mind is the assimilation of beings,\u201d it is clear that\n\u201cassimilating\u201d and \u201cmeasuring\u201d are the\ndominant metaphors Nicholas uses to understand what we do as knowers.\nAs knowers we measure the things we know and we also are\nassimilated or likened in some way to the objects of\nknowledge. Along with the \u201chorizontal\u201d notion of our\nconcepts being images of things as well as of the mind\u2019s own\noneness, assimilatio also has a \u201cvertical\u201d\ndimension because in knowing we liken ourselves to our divine\nOriginal.\n\nWhat is at issue is the connection and tension between the two\nmetaphors. Supposedly complementary, assimilatio and\nmensura give no obvious answer to what provides the measure\nfor the content and validity of our knowledge\u2014is it the things\nknown or our knowing minds? Nicholas never questioned that the varied\nthings we discover in the natural universe and fashion ourselves in\nthe social and cultural milieu exist independently of our minds (if\nnot of God\u2019s). But the question here is whether our knowledge is\nderived from what is independent of mind or is in whole or part the\nresult of the linguistic and conceptual measures we learn, construct\nand employ in dealing with reality. If knowing is creative or\nproductive, solely a matter of our \u201cmeasuring,\u201d it is easy\nto see how it is an image of God\u2019s creating, but not how it is a\nlikening to extra-mental things. If things outside measure and cause\nwhat we know, we can see why human knowledge is a likening to things,\nbut not how it is an image of God\u2019s creative mind. The two\nmetaphors may well run counter to each other.\n\nBecause Nicholas himself does not frame the question in this way, he\nprovides ample evidence for both answers. Some interpreters, such as\nJ. Hopkins (1996), see his use of medieval scholastic language for the\npowers and activities of the mind as placing him mainly in the\nmedieval Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of critical realism, while\nemphasizing anew the active character of knowing at all levels and\nthus stressing that the mind is an active power. Those interpreters\nwhose proclivities are more Kantian, for instance, K. Flasch (1998)\nand K. Kremer (1978, 2000), find in his texts gestures towards what\nwould in Kant become \u201cthe transcendental unity of\napperception\u201d and \u201ca priori\u201d concepts of the\nunderstanding, not to mention the stress on active judgment. The view\nof the present author is that both of these interpretations may miss\nthe Neoplatonic context in which Nicholas discusses human knowledge\nand may underestimate how important philosophical theology is to the\nCusan exposition of knowing.\n\nWhat are the clues we need to connect the metaphors of likening and\nmeasuring in a complementary way? We must return to Nicholas\u2019\nunderlying conviction that our minds are images of God\u2019s mind\nand that this connection between them is constant and thoroughgoing\nand thus should never be overlooked. Then we may begin to understand\nthat just as God\u2019s creative measuring sets the ontological\nlimits of everything God creates, so our corresponding measuring can\nat best be assimilative of the mind-independent things we wish to know\nbut do not create or place in reality, and yet be creative in\nmeasuring and adjudicating the conceptual domain that results from our\nknowing them.\n\nBoth of these strands can seen to be operative in chapter 7 of The\nLayman: About Mind. There Cusanus gives a somewhat more detailed\naccount of how he sees the mind\u2019s cognitive functions operating\nat the levels of sensation, imagination, reasoning and intellectual\nvision or intuition. Here, as in his later work entitled\nCompendium, we find that Nicholas inherited a technical\nvocabulary and conceptual framework for human knowing that embodies\nthe medieval Aristotelian view that natural things are the causes and\nmeasures of perceptual and conceptual human knowledge. On that view,\nwhat we understand is to correspond to the intelligible aspects of\nthings that are mind-independent so that an identity in\nintelligibility between mind and thing results\u2014the mind is\nmeasured by things. While Nicholas insists that the active,\nself-moving mind directs and integrates the joint operation of our\nknowing capacities, he also agrees that the mind has no innate ideas\nand that mental life has to be awakened or stimulated by direct\ncontact with the perceptible world. He never questions that the\nperceptible world (\u201cthe plurality of things\u201d) exists and\nis independent of our minds and our knowledge.\n\nIt is the mind\u2019s power to discriminate and make sense of what we\nperceive, imagine or remember that Cusanus emphasizes. He writes,\nspeaking of imagination, \u201cWhen sensible things are not present,\nit [imagination] conforms itself to things in a confused way and\nwithout discriminating one condition from another. But [when]\nfunctioning with thinking imagination conforms itself to things while\ndiscriminating one condition from another.\u201d (Idiota de\nmente, c.7)\n\nTo help us understand the mind\u2019s engagement in perceptual\n\u201cassimilation,\u201d Nicholas turns to the work of sculptors\nand craftsmen who use wax or clay to make an impression of some shape\nso they can work from that likeness. When it is a matter of planning\nsomething to do or make, it is easy to see our minds as active. What\nabout perceptual experiences where what we encounter is not up to us?\nNicholas returns to the wax, asking us to imagine wax informed by mind\nin the way mind informs our capacities for sensing and proposing that\nmind so imagined could \u201cform the wax to every shape presented to\nit.\u201d (c.7) Nicholas is saying, in effect, that\n\u201cassimilation\u201d in perception is indeed a matter of\nreason\u2019s active selecting and managing the deliverances of sense\nand imagination that result from our encounters with perceptible\nthings. We are not mere passive recipients of colors, sounds, textures\nand so on, but our minds differentiate and connect perceptions and\nimages in order to form concepts based on the discriminations of\nreason.\n\nNicholas avers that our knowledge of the natural and cultural world\nembodied in and made systematic in the technical and mechanical and\nliberal arts will remain \u201cconjectural.\u201d The reason is that\nwe are not dealing with the true reality of mind-independent things\nwhose true forms are one with God. We only encounter the physically\nlocated temporal realities that are images of the really real. As he\nremarks, \u201cthe notions that are attained through the\nassimilations of reason are uncertain, because they are in accord with\nthe images of forms rather than with their true [forms].\u201d\n(ibid., c.7) Only the concepts of mathematics are not\nconjectural because we fashion or construct these ideas ourselves.\nConsequently our conceptions of them can be precise and certain, for\nas conceptual entities they escape the sorts of change and bodily\nlimits characteristic of the physical world.\n2.2.3 The Measure of Knowledge\n\nBut this sketch of our knowing powers as assimilative does not settle\nwhat is normative for human knowing or what it means to take the mind\nas a measure. Nicholas takes up this explicitly a bit later in chapter\n9 of The Layman: About Mind. When he is questioned how the\nmind can be a measure adequate to such a variety of things, the layman\nresponds somewhat cryptically:\n\nIn the way an \u201cabsolute\u201d face would make itself the\nmeasure of all faces. For when you attend to the fact that mind is a\ncertain absolute measure that cannot be greater or smaller since it is\nnot restricted to quantity, and when you attend to the fact that this\nmeasure is alive so that it measures by itself (as if a living compass\nwere to measure by itself), then you grasp how it makes itself into a\nconcept, measure, or exemplar so that it attains itself in everything.\n(c.9)\n\n\nEarlier the layman had described the human mind as a measure that sets\nlimits, conceptual and linguistic boundaries, to all that it knows.\nWhat this presupposes are the requirements of any measuring,\nquantitative or qualitative: (1) something measurable to be\nascertained, (2) a measure, that is a criterion or norm embodying\nstandard units, (3) the actual measuring that employs the norm, (4)\nthe results of the process, the measure taken.\n\nAll these requirements can be found in the passage above. What we want\nto know counts as the cognitively measurable (\u201csuch a variety of\nthings\u201d). These knowables span items in the natural world and\nthe cultural sphere and their features, as well as concepts in the\nrealm of thought itself. The \u201cconcept, measure, or\nexemplar\u201d is the qualitative norm the mind employs and of which\nit is the source. The mind does the actual measuring (\u201cmeasures\nby itself\u201d) and \u201cmakes itself a measure\u201d or norm in\njudging and taking the measure of each item across the range of things\nit knows. What results is the knowledge we obtain when the mind\nbecomes \u201cequal to such a variety of things\u201d and\n\u201cattains itself in everything.\u201d Our knowledge includes\nwhat we gain from everyday experience in society, from the natural and\nhuman sciences, and from literature and the other arts.\n\nWhat does the reference to \u201cabsolute face\u201d in the passage\nquoted come to? \u201cAbsolute\u201d is a term Cusanus usually\nreserved for God as the infinite One free from every limitation and\nrestriction. Here it is transferred to our minds as images of God. Our\nminds are not limited to quantitative measures and thus can determine\nthe conceptual measures or \u201cunits\u201d that best fit or are\nadequate to the different sorts of things we want to know. We can\nanswer questions of \u201cwhat sort,\u201d not just of \u201chow\nmuch.\u201d Our concepts and judgments are assimilative or actively\nlikened to what we know because we construct the conceptual measures\nappropriate, if never wholly adequate, to what we are investigating or\nthinking about. As thus relatively unrestricted or\n\u201cabsolute,\u201d our minds can be conformed to whatever is\nknowable in whatever way we can grasp it. Just as the absolute divine\n\u201cface\u201d or mind is the infinite measure of all the\ncreaturely minds that are its images, so the human mind measures the\ndeterminate conceptual realities that reflect its own finite unity or\noneness.\n\nHuman concepts are measures insofar they involve choice and\nconstruction, application and interpretation, whether quantitative or\nqualitative. The use of a given group of concepts or a particular\nscheme of ideas or interpretative framework is a matter of human\ncreating. If we recognize some mind-independent phenomena we want to\nexplore and come to know, whether in nature or in culture, we should\nalso recognize that it is up to us to construct and employ the\nappropriate cognitive measures in order to \u201ctake the\nmeasure\u201d of the state of affairs in question. Being introduced\nto some cognitive domain or area of practice we are unfamiliar with\ninvolves learning \u201ca new vocabulary\u201d and set of ideas\nalready utilized and standard in that area. Unless and until we can\nunderstand the concepts and language in question, we cannot make sense\nout of what we perceive and continue to understand in our previous\nterms.\n\nThat Nicholas is using \u201cmeasuring\u201d in this sense is\nbrought home to us by the metaphor he employs in the passage quoted\nabove from chapter 9 where he says the mind is \u201ca living compass\nthat measures by itself.\u201d In contrast with a fixed or\nnon-adjustable straight ruler, a compass or caliper can be adjusted to\nfit a range of sizes and shapes. Cusanus\u2019 fanciful\n\u201cliving\u201d compass reminds us that as knowers we can\nactively accommodate our ideas to what we want to know. As a compass\ncan be adjusted to find the quantitative measure of a variety of sizes\nand shapes, so our minds are able to fashion, adopt, modify and\nutilize both the literal and the symbolic ideas and concepts available\nto us for exploring and understanding the natural, social and\nconceptual worlds we inherit and extend.\n\nThis may help us understand why Nicholas\u2019 sketch of\nmens involves both the mind-independent things and the mind\nitself as normative measures of the assimilation that is human\ncognition. We become like the knowable features of the things we know\nand we fashion the conceptual and judgmental measures whereby we take\nthem into ourselves as known. The full determinate intelligibility of\nmind-independent things and states of affairs provides a kind of ideal\nlimit that we acknowledge in recognizing the inadequacy and\nshortcomings of what we do know about them. That is why Nicholas deems\nour knowledge \u201cconjectural.\u201d\n\nAlong with providing this ideal limit to what we know, things outside\nthe mind also stand as referents that themselves measure our cognitive\nassimilating. Recognizing that they exist, we also acknowledge that\nthey are what our knowledge is about. And we constantly return to what\nwe seek to understand to assess the adequacy of our conceptions and to\ncorrect any mistakes or misinterpretations in our interpretations.\nDeprived of these independent measures, our knowledge has no reference\noutside the mind and no standard for revising or improving our\nconceptual measures as more or less adequate to what we are trying to\nunderstand.\n\nThe Cusan answer, then, to the question of whether mind or the\nmind-independent realities are the \u201cmeasures\u201d of what we\nknow may thus be seen as an attempt to have it both ways. We are both\nmeasured by the things we know and we construct the concepts and\nconceptual frameworks whereby we measure them, however\n\u201cconjecturally.\u201d There are situations and realities we\nwant to understand that challenge us to adjust to what we perceive,\nexamine, and experience. So, too, there are situations and realities\nthat require us to modify our ideas and concepts and symbols so that\nthey will be consistent one with another and with the rest of our\nbeliefs.\n\nNicholas of Cusa thus combines the metaphors of assimilatio\nand mensuratio in his account of what provides the cognitive\nnorms or criteria for human knowing. We cannot resolve the tension\nbetween the two that we find in what he says, but must hold onto it.\nThe reason is that, as God\u2019s images, we do not create but must\nrecognize what God has created as independent of human knowledge. We\nmay fashion the interpretative measures whereby we know created\nthings, but we do this while acknowledging that the full\nintelligibility of each determinate reality is ultimately identical\nwith God\u2019s unknowable Oneness. We may aspire to full\nintelligibility but can reach it only in mathematics. That is why our\nbest knowledge, even of the mind itself, remains conjectural, sharing\nGod\u2019s truth but limited to human ways of knowing.\n2.3 Symbols and Philosophical Theology\n\nThe relationship between On Learned Ignorance and On\nConjectures sets a pattern for the many shorter theoretical works\nNicholas was to write in the two decades that followed. The basic\ninsights and the framework laid out in On Learned Ignorance\nis never discarded and never substantively modified. Instead\nNicholas\u2019 dialogues and briefer treatises can be read as\nproposing many different metaphors or symbols for understanding his\nteaching about the relationship between God and creatures. Three\nexamples of these metaphors may give some idea of the power and\nfreshness of his speculative imagining. The first is his use of the\nicon and the wall in The Vision of God (1453); the second his\nattempt to capture the God-creature connection by describing God as\n\u201cNot Other\u201d in the dialogue by that name (On the Not\nOther, 1461); the third his fascination with mathematics and its\nsymbolic potential. While Cusanus never surrenders his initial insight\nthat there is no proportion between infinite and finite, thinking\nthrough these later symbols and neologisms lets us see how these\nindirect means enable some movement of mind and heart towards the\ndivine Mystery with whom we are ever connected.\n2.3.1 The Icon and the Wall\n\nCusanus wrote The Vision of God in the form of a prayer,\nresponding to the request of the Benedictines of Tegernsee for a\ntreatise on mystical theology. With it he sent them an\n\u201call-seeing\u201d icon and proposed an exercise for its use to\ngive them some understanding of God\u2019s seeing their attempts to\nsee God. The icon was probably a \u201cVeronica\u201d or image of\nthe face of the suffering Jesus in which the eyes were portrayed as\nlooking out of the picture plane. As a result, from whatever\nstandpoint one looked at the painting, it seemed the eyes of Jesus\nlooked directly into the viewer\u2019s own eyes. Thus it could\nsymbolize at once both God\u2019s vision of us and our vision of God\n(the combined objective and subjective senses of visio\nDei).\n\nNicholas begins by warning that \u201cWhatever is apparent with\nregard to the icon of God\u2019s sight is truer with regard to\nGod\u2019s true sight.\u201d(c. 1) And what does appear when we\nplace ourselves with the monks viewing the painting and reflect? Since\nit is a painting we see, what we seem to experience as we look into\nthe eyes of Jesus is not really taking place. The face portrayed\nneither looks at nor sees anyone; in fact, the viewer\u2019s gaze is\nthe norm for this experience of a face-to-face encounter. Yet because\nof the spatial and temporal simultaneity the apparent gaze of the icon\ninvites the viewer to enter into the world of the painting and tends\nto privilege what is portrayed, namely Jesus gazing at me. I move back\nand forth from my customary reactions when eyes are looking into my\neyes to the realization that this eye contact is illusory.\n\nBut the illusory image in this case is of Christ suffering and looking\nat me. If this painting is to mediate between my reality and what it\nportrays, it obviously invites me to look beyond, since this is an\nimage of the One who is the image of the Father. Twice\nremoved from the actual divine seeing and being seen it is supposed to\nsymbolize, Nicholas\u2019 use of this icon lets us understand how far\nwe stand from God\u2019s own seeing. Yet Nicholas\u2019 initial\nwarning also reminds us that what is symbolized here by the painting\nis all the more so in reality. We are in truth preceded and embraced\nby Christ\u2019s seeing us.\n\nIn seeing we are seen\u2014this mutual relatedness is at least what\nthe icon symbolizes. But Nicholas goes further, proposing that\nGod\u2019s seeing and God\u2019s being seen are identical:\n\nO Lord, when you look upon me with an eye of graciousness, what is\nyour seeing, other than your being seen by me? In seeing me, you who\nare deus absconditus [hidden God] give yourself to be seen by\nme. No one can see You except insofar as you grant that you be seen.\nTo see you is not other than that you see the one who sees you. (c.5,\nHopkins translation)\n\n\nIn this way God seen is identically God seeing. The reason is that for\nGod to be seen by any creature is nothing else than for God to\n\u201csee\u201d that creature gazing. But the icon also reminds us\nof our distance from seeing God. I can see the depicted eyes of Jesus\neven though no real eyes are present. But I cannot see the divine face\nor its vision even though God\u2019s reality is present and\n\u201csees\u201d me. The dialectic of divine presence and absence,\nof human seeing and not seeing that I experience with the icon is thus\nturned inside out. When I look at the icon of Christ, what seems\npresent, its seeing, is really absent, yet God\u2019s seeing is\nreally present though it seems absent.\n\nWhat the icon thus symbolizes is the experienced simultaneous\nconnection of different levels of reality. Indeed, I have separate\nreality as a contracted image of God only through my relation to my\ndivine Source. What is telling about Nicholas\u2019 version of seeing\nGod is neither what vision discerns nor what practices one must follow\nin order to gain the correct standpoint for such seeing. Rather he\nrevises the meaning of \u201cseeing God\u201d so that God is both\nsubject and object of our purported vision of God.\n\nYet this vision of God is merely purported. Cusanus leads us through a\nseries of reflections on seeing and on the face of God only to let us\nrealize that, whatever ratio or discursive reason comes to\nrealize, God is located beyond both imaginative exercise and\nconceptual understanding. Nicholas symbolizes our approach to this\nbeyond by encouraging us to enter \u201cinto a certain secret and\nhidden silence wherein there is no knowledge or concept of a\nface,\u201d characterizing it as an \u201cobscuring mist, haze,\ndarkness or ignorance.\u201d (c.6) He invokes the coincidence of\nopposites from On Learned Ignorance and, in chapter 9 of\nThe Vision of God, proposes his second central metaphor: the\nwall of paradise. God dwells inside this wall, and the wall also\nsymbolizes the coincidence of opposites and thus the defeat of\ndiscursive reason and the principle of contradiction.\n\nJust how are we to think through the coincidence of opposites and\nattempt to move beyond the wall to some sort of \u201cseeing\u201d\nGod? Nicholas proposes that three locations in relation to the wall\nmap three stages in the mystical quest, using the metaphorical couple\nof \u201cenfolding/unfolding\u201d from On Learned\nIgnorance. Reason can understand things enfolded in or identical\nwith God as different from the same things unfolded in the created\nuniverse. At this first stage we are outside the wall. The second\nstage is at the wall itself, where Nicholas places us with Christ at\nthe door or threshold of an entrance in the wall. Here enfolding and\nunfolding coincide and we encounter the barrier of the coincidence of\nopposites. At best we acknowledge that creating and being created are\none and the same in God. A third stage is beyond the entrance and\ninside the wall where enfolding/unfolding fall away and Cusanus points\nto God\u2019s silent presence and utter transcendence, \u201cfree\nfrom whatever can be spoken of or thought of\u201d (c.11) The third\nstage involves recognition that God\u2019s infinity remains\nunknowable to us in conceptual terms.\n\nCusanus proposes some possible indirect routes that will give us no\npositive insight or conceptual grasp of the divine Essence. For\ninstance, if we look to the very oppositions and contradictions that\nplague our normal thinking about God, we may do more justice to the\nunique relation between God and creatures. In his words, \u201cthe\noppositeness of opposites is oppositeness without oppositeness.\u201d\n(c.13) He identifies the infinite God with this \u201coppositeness of\nopposites.\u201d Now the \u201copposites\u201d in question are the\nordinary things of our experience that are separate and distinct and\nthat may have opposed or mutually exclusive properties.\n\nDesignating God as the Oppositeness of such opposites can take us from\nthe distinctions and oppositions with which we are familiar to the One\nwho is responsible for there being such oppositions. God is distinct\nfrom these oppositions and differences but only in a way that\nestablishes their reality. Yet God\u2019s oppositeness is\n\u201cwithout oppositeness\u201d since God\u2019s distinctiveness\nis unlimited and beyond familiar oppositions. In fact, God\u2019s\noppositeness encompasses or enfolds all opposites in God as\nidentically God and encompasses or unfolds all opposites in creation\nby constituting them as what they are in all their determinate, finite\ndifferences. We are to think together both the way finite\nthings are opposed and God\u2019s transcendent oppositeness\nthat is \u201copposed\u201d to those opposites, not as they are to\none another, but so as to be ontologically responsible for the\noppositions with which we are familiar.\n2.3.2 God is the Not Other\n\nIn De li Non Aliud/On the Not Other (1462) Nicholas returns\nto the ancient Platonic categories of the One and the Other in order\nto re-construe in novel language what Christians believe about the\ndependence of creatures on their Creator. Several of Cusanus\u2019\nlater works use verbal coinages or Latin neologisms as\n\u201cnames\u201d or characterizations of God that are original with\nhim, though they have earlier echoes in Christian Neoplatonism. In\nthis dialogue he uses the expression \u201cthe not other\u201d as a\nsubstantive for God as the divine Not-Other, even though we are more\nfamiliar with the phrase in comparative expressions that are negative\nways of stating self-identity. For instance, \u201cthe tree is not\nother than (= the same as, identical with) the tree.\u201d\n\nWhen we use reason to recognize differences and to make distinctions,\nwe are attempting to do justice to the plurality and variety of the\nnatural and cultural realms with which we are most familiar. Even\nthings of the same kind are different numerically, and speaking and\nthinking clearly about things and their features requires our\ndifferentiating what is determinate about them. We expect them to stay\nthe same as they are and to remain different from other things and we\nreflect this in our language of identity and difference when we\ndescribe and define what we perceive and understand.\n\nNicholas is attempting to capitalize on the way we differentiate\ncreated things to signal and symbolize their divine Creator. While\neach created thing is not other than itself, so to speak, it certainly\nis other or different from other things. And created things are\ndifferent from God as well. But Nicholas is proposing a way of\n\u201cnaming\u201d God that will underline how God\u2019s\ndifference from God\u2019s creatures is not even close to one\ncreature\u2019s difference from another creature. God\u2019s\ndifference is categorially different, so to speak, from one\ncreature\u2019s otherness from a second creature. Cusanus can thus\nparadoxically assert that God is \u201cnot other\u201d than anything\nGod has created and is sustaining in being. Indeed, we do well to\nthink of God as \u201cthe Not-Other.\u201d\n\nHere is what Nicholas writes:\n\nNot Other is not an other, nor is it other than any other, nor is it\nan other in an other\u2014for no other reason than that it is Not\nOther, which can in no way be other, as if it something were lacking\nto it, as to an other. For an other which is other than something\nlacks that than which it is other. But Not Other, because it is not\nother than anything, does not lack anything nor can anything be\noutside it. (c.6)\n\n\nWe may paraphrase this rather cryptic passage as follows. The divine\nNot-Other is simply not one of the things we are familiar with in the\nworld we inhabit, where all is multiplicity and difference, where each\nthing or state of affairs is other than or different from every other\nexistent thing or situation that obtains. Nicholas terms the multiple\nthings we deal with \u201cothers\u201d because each one of them,\neach \u201cother,\u201d is distinct from every other thing. Nicholas\nalso proposes that such finite things possess and lack what things\ndifferent from them possess\u2014to be other or distinct is precisely\nnot to be one or any of the finite others. Our language and thought\nbusy themselves in finding and making further distinctions and\ndivisions between things and parts of things, between one condition\nand another, between one state of affairs and another. So we come to\nknow that one thing is other than or separate from another thing or\nthat we find it in another that is related to, yet different from,\nsomething else.\n\nNicholas\u2019 central point is that the divine Not-Other is nothing\nlike all the finite, limited others of our experience. Nicholas\nwrites, \u201cNot Other does not lack anything.\u201d Even in common\nsense terms, any given thing is \u201cplenty lacking,\u201d to speak\ncolloquially. No matter what it has, it arguably is lacking some of\nwhat it should have as a specimen of its type, and it certainly lacks\nwhat other things not of its kind possess. One way to think of the\nfinite things with which we are familiar is to consider that their\nbeing limited means that they are just so much and not more. But this\nis exactly how we should not think of God, who \u201cdoes not lack\nanything\u201d and outside of whom nothing can exist. As Nicholas\nsays, \u201cBut God is Not-Other because God is not other than other,\neven though \u2018not other\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 seem\nopposed. But other is not opposed to God from whom it has that it is\nother.\u201d (c.6)\n\nThe opposition in this case is entirely different because, though\ncreatures are dependent functions of God and may be interdependent\nfunctions of one another, God is not a dependent function of\ncreatures. God is precisely not any of the others and so is not other\nor different in the way creatures are. We thus have two sorts of\ndifferentiation or otherness, the opposition between distinct\ncreatures and the opposition between creatures and God. The\n\u201cNot\u201d in \u201cNot-Other\u201d differentiates God from\ncreatures but does not exclude the divine Not-Other since the\nNot-Other ontologically determines creatures. Thinking God as\nNot-Other requires a characteristic Cusan dialectical thinking, not\nsimply affirming or denying difference. We are to recognize and\nacknowledge that the divine Not-Other is both not one of the\nothers and at once not other than any or all of them.\n\nTo put this more formally, the difference or opposition between\ncreated things is both symmetrical and transitive. The basis for their\ndistinction is their identity: their symmetrical otherness is the\nresult of their substantial not-otherness, so to speak. But created\nthings\u2019 difference from God is asymmetrical and intransitive.\nTrue, the divine Not-Other is not one of the creatures, but in a\ndifferent way than they are different from one another. Cusanus gives\nexpression to this important difference between finite and Infinite\nwhen he asserts that the divine Not-Other is not other than\nany created other. Negatively, the Not-Other is not finite as the\nothers are; positively, the reflexivity characteristic of a limited\nthing\u2019s self-identity also characterizes the Not-Other\u2019s\nrelation with it.\n\nJust as any creature is not other than itself so it is not other than\nthe divine Not-Other. The divine Not-Other both is and is not every\nfinite other. The reason is that distinct created things possess their\nvery status as beings, and thus their otherness, from and through God.\nGod, the divine Not-Other, is causally responsible for things\u2019\nexisting as separate and self-identical others. For Nicholas, nothing\ncan have being outside of God.\n2.3.3 Mathematics and God\n\nRecent publications, and in particular, D.Albertson\u2019s\nMathematical Theologies(2014), have highlighted another key\ntheme and its attendant metaphors in Nicholas\u2019 works:\nmathematics and number. Cusanus believes that no knowledge we have is\nmore certain than mathematics, given that it is the construction of\nour own minds. Mathematical ideas are the paradigm of how the human\nmind unfolds a conceptual universe that parallels and forms an image\nof God\u2019s unfolding of the created world. Number here refers\nprimarily to arithmetic and geometry, to the whole numbers and to\nplane and solid figures. The latter are often imagined as in movement\nor constructing other figures. Nicholas joins enfolding/unfolding and\nthe certainty of mathematics to the Christian tradition that\neverything is created in the divine word or Logos.\n\nGeometrical figures are used early in Book 1 of On Learned\nIgnorance to illustrate how our knowledge of created things is\nonly approximative. A bit later we are led to extrapolate straight and\ncurved lines as an aid to understanding the coincidence of opposites\nand to moving human thought towards the God who is unknowable by\nreason. Book 2 uses number to illustrate enfolding and\nunfolding\u2014as the number series unfolds what is enfolded in the\nunit, so God unfolds all created things. Nicholas later introduces the\ngeometrical image of the sphere whose center is everywhere and whose\ncircumference is nowhere to explain how the physical universe\u2019s\nlack of boundaries is an image of God\u2019s infinity. Book 2 also\nopens and closes with reflection on the quadrivium: arithmetic,\ngeometry, music and astronomy. Book 3 returns to the image of the\ninfinite sphere for the combination of absolute and contracted reality\nin the God-man.\n\nOn Conjectures moves directly into arithmetic and geometry\nwith its conjectural reflections on the decade\u2019s embracing all\nnumber and with its ordering of reality\u2019s oneness and otherness\nusing the spatial diagrams P and U that employ cones and spheres. Just\nas the number series unfolds the unit, so the created universe unfolds\nGod\u2019s creating, and human concepts (such as numbers and\ngeometric figures) unfold the oneness of the human mind. In this way a\nhuman being is truly a \u201csecond God.\u201d\n\nNicholas\u2019 later works of the 1450s extend the notion of number\nand of enfolding/unfolding that he inherited from Boethius and the\ntwelfth-century school of Chartres. Number and size (multitudo et\nmagnitudo) are central to The Layman: On Mind where\nmeasuring is proposed as the layman\u2019s definition of the human\nmind. Measuring is then used directly in The Layman: Experiments\nwith Weights. Nicholas proposes that the Divine Word in whom all\nthings are created or unfolded in time is to be thought together with\nhuman measuring as the closest sign or image of the Divine Oneness. In\nthe background stands the saying from the Book of Wisdom11.21\nthat in creating God ordered \u201call things in measure, number and\nweight.\u201d This way number and mathematical ideas take on more\nthan their usual employment for human ends and become a way to the\nCreator always present to creaturely unfoldings in human thought.\n\nThe Vision of God (1453) proposes an exercise for the monks\nbased on the center and circumference of circle wherein seeing from\nthe circumference and being seen from the center collapse into a\nfigure of mystical oneness: being seen seeing. In the same year\nNicholas composes Complementary Theological Considerations (De\ntheologicis complementis). There he features God as a\nmathematician who creates in the Equality of the Divine\nWord\u2014unfolding as well human beings whose quadrivial mathematics\nis an image of the divine creativity. God is now named \u201cinfinite\nangle\u201d that unites maximal and minimal angles and the\nnon-quantitative number of everything. Nicholas thus brings together\nhis theological and mathematical concepts from the 1440s and unites\nnumber, enfolding/unfolding and the Divine Word.\n3. A Neoplatonism of His Own\n\nHow does Nicholas\u2019 Neoplatonism aid his thinking about God? One\nadvantage is that Nicholas can take the basic asymmetry between\nparadigmatic Platonic Forms and the perceptible realm of particular\nthings that are images of the Forms and apply that asymmetry to the\nway the First Principle, God, is related to all other created\nrealities. In working out this relationship, Plato proposed that what\nresults for individual Forms is that all particulars\n\u201cparticipate\u201d in the relevant Form just the way an image\nreflects and depends on its original. That is to say, the Form does\nnot require the particulars but is prior ontologically. The relation\nbetween Form and particulars is not one of reciprocal dependence.\nApplied to the first ontological principle, or to the Christian God,\nthe result is to let all the multiple, complex creatures participate\nin their ultimate Source while the divine Creator remains simple,\nunparticipated and unchanged. As Christian medieval thinkers (even the\nAristotelians agreed on this point) were accustomed to express it,\ncreatures depend on God while God is not at all dependent on\ncreatures. All the dependence is one-way.\n\nAnd that dependence is interpreted in Platonic and Biblical terms, as\nthe dependence of creaturely images on a divine Original. While the\ntotal reality of an image requires the influence of the original,\nthere is nothing about the latter that is ontologically in need of the\nimage. In Platonism this effectively means there is\n\u201cseparation\u201d of the intelligible and perceptible realms,\nfor in fact the perceptible cannot exist without the very intelligible\nthat abides unaffected by the realm of multiplicity and change. While\nnot being themselves Forms, perceptible things are not really separate\nfrom the intelligible Forms on which they depend. No less than Form\nand perceptible thing in Platonism and Neoplatonism, in Christian\nNeoplatonism Creator and creature are bound together in a parallel\nasymmetry.\n\nIf this asymmetry is rethought in terms of the presence required for\nthe creatures to be all that they are by nature, it will turn out that\nGod (or the One in non-Christian Neoplatonisms), the greater and prior\nreality, must always be there if creaturely reality is to be\nforthcoming and to continue. Now creatures as created images can stand\nfor manifestation and reflection of (and for Christian thinkers,\nlikeness to) as well as for dependence on God, for the divine presence\npenetrates and encompasses each and all creatures without ever being\nlimited or captured by any of them. While Plato\u2019s Forms play a\ndefinitive role in the perceptible realm as responsible for the\ndeterminate characteristics of things, they count as a kind of present\nabsence. No less determinative is the ongoing presence of the\nChristian God and that, too, has become a kind of absence. How should\nwe attempt to understand this?\n\nOur conceptions of the absence or presence of one thing to another are\ntaken originally from and remain most at home in the realm of limited\nphysical beings. Here presence to or absence from another involves the\nsame sort of mutuality or reciprocity that the same corporeal realm of\nlimited things must always manifest. If body A is present to or absent\nfrom body B, B is present to or absent from A and vice versa. The\nother sorts of important presence or absence we are familiar\nwith\u2014presence in thought, in memory and imagination and\naffection, for instance\u2014are metaphorical to some degree and are\nextensions from and find their source in our experience of some prior\nphysical presence, whether merely perceived and understood, or hoped\nfor, or feared. So too with the kinds of metaphorical absence we\nrecognize when some present person is, as we say, \u201cjust not\nthere.\u201d And absence, whether indifferent, bad or good,\npresupposes presence. Such metaphorical presences and absences of\nlimited things to one another might thus be understood as absent\npresences or present absences.\n\nAnd so we are able to speculate about the case of a non-finite\npresence-in-absence by starting with but moving beyond the limits of\nthe presence and absence we are familiar with in the realm of limited\nthings. Now we turn to the presence of the unfamiliar infinite One as\nwhat is finally required, even if not obviously experienced, to keep\nthe creaturely image present and real. In this case, we may think that\nabsence becomes what is metaphorical and the presence of the First is\nin truth ineluctably and literally necessary to explain the reality of\nanything and everything. But God\u2019s presence is hardly like that\nof one physical thing to another.\n\nThis means that the presence of God and God\u2019s identity with\nthings is not to be thought as the kind of reciprocity, say, that two\ncreated physical things have that are present to one another, let\nalone similar or identical to each other. What is distinctive about\nChristian Neoplatonism is its ability to hold together dialectically\nin thought the insight it provides about this asymmetrical,\nnon-reciprocal ontological connection between God and creatures. God\npenetrates and surpasses or exceeds each thing God creates and\nencompasses. Creatures are thus themselves real with the limited sort\nof independence they manifest, yet they are at once in God and indeed\none with God without being themselves divine.\n\nBut what has all this to do with Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s having a\nNeoplatonism of his own? What is characteristic of his thought, I want\nto propose, is that in key passages of major works he proposes this\nsame kind of dialectical thinking to enable our grasping the general\nrelationship between God and creatures. But the thinking is supposed\nto reflect an ontological dialectic, that is to say, a relationship\nthat is real whether we acknowledge it or not. The dialectical\nrelation between God and creatures is something towards which we\nmostly gesture in our efforts to do it justice in thought and speech.\nBut is this not merely Proclus or Dionysius or Eriugena or Eckhart\nrevisited in the fifteenth century? The answer is both yes and no.\n\nYes, the dialectical reality envisioned by Nicholas should be little\ndifferent than that pointed to by earlier Christian Neoplatonists.\nNeither Plato\u2019s Forms nor the Christian God did or could change\nover the centuries nor did the need of particulars and creatures for\ntheir intelligible and divine originals. But also, no, for Cusanus\ngives the dialectical relation his own expression in a series of novel\nmetaphors for the connection between God and creatures. Some of his\noriginal metaphors, such as the coincidence of opposites,\nenfolding/unfolding, God as the Not Other, and as the Oppositeness of\nopposites, are controlled by and witness to that same asymmetrical\nrelationship, yet lead our speculative imaginations in some new\ndirections that would otherwise remain unexplored.\n\nIf only God can bespeak Godself in literal terms, then we humans are\ngraced with metaphors. What Cusanus provides in his metaphorical\nforays is not simply imaginative originality, but a series of\nmetaphors designed to remind us that there is no proportion between\ncreatures and creator; that indeed there is an asymmetry between them.\nMoreover, our best ways of conceiving and asserting this necessary\nlack of reciprocal dependence should be built into the metaphors we\nchoose. This is why one may not need a theory of metaphor to do\njustice to the Cusan project of philosophical theology. Rather, the\nCusan project is Neoplatonic and has its own traditional strictures on\nany metaphors he chooses: the ontology determines the metaphors, the\nmetaphors do not determine the ontology. What makes Nicholas\u2019\nthought a Neoplatonism of his own is precisely the grasp his metaphors\ndemonstrate of those ontological strictures, as well as the\nspeculative imagination he evinces in the range, originality and\nvariety of metaphors for what we can and cannot understand about\nGod\u2019s connection with creatures.\n4. Contribution to Political Ideas\n\nNicholas of Cusa has attracted frequent notice in the history of\npolitical ideas because of his early work, The Catholic\nConcordance/De Concordantia Catholica (1433\u201334). This\nlengthy work in three books is aimed first of all at an ecclesiatical\naudience at the Council of Basel and only secondarily, in Book 3, at\nthe Holy Roman Empire and its electors of the emperor. Nicholas\u2019\nideas stand squarely in the conciliarist tradition following proposals\nfrom the Council of Constance (1414\u201318), and thus privilege the\ncouncil\u2019s authority above the pope\u2019s. In Book 1 he\nexpounds a hierarchical view of creation and of the church, following\nDionysius the Areopagite. Then he uses both canon law and historical\ndocuments from and about the early church councils to undergird his\nview of council and papacy. Yet he never denies the importance of the\npositions of pope and emperor. Throughout Nicholas works to harmonize\n(=concordantia) the many different strands in church law and\npolitical theory.\n\nOver the last century scholars of political history have singled out\nchapters, particularly in Book 2, where Nicholas discusses consent as\na prerequisite for legitimate law and government. Going beyond\ntradition and canon law, he argues on the basis of people\u2019s\nnatural freedom (\u201cmen are by nature equal in power and equally\nfree\u201d) that all governance comes from the consent of the\nsubjects. This argument to explicitly institutionalize consent is\nNicholas\u2019 original contribution. He follows it with proposals on\nrepresentation that move from representation as virtual impersonation\nto representation as delegation based on those represented selecting\ntheir representatives. This is one of the first explicit statements in\nthe West of the institutional limits to be placed on rulers and of the\nidea that people must consent to their representative\ninstitutions.\n\nEven after he changed allegiance to the side of papal supremacy,\nNicholas used his ideas to argue in later brief writings that Basel\nwas not truly representative and that consent was embodied in the\ncollege of cardinals. In the following centuries, secular parliaments\nreturned to ideas of consent and representation (though not directly\nto Nicholas\u2019 book) in attempting to restrict the power of\nmonarchs. In the church itself, tradition continued to outweigh\ninnovation, and the idea of conciliar superiority to the pope seemed\ndead for centuries. Some twentieth-century thinking in the Roman\nCatholic Church has returned to and enlivened ideas about council and\npapacy propounded by Nicholas of Cusa.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriTex\">Primary Texts</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriTex\">Primary Texts</a>": ["</h3>\n<p>\n<em>Nicolai de Cusa Opera Omnia jussu et auctoritate Academicae\nLitterarum Heidelbergensis</em>, 1932\u20132007, Leipzig-Hamburg:\nMeiner.</p>\n<h4>German Translations</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Philosophisch-Theologische Schriften</em>, 1967, 3 volumes, L.\nGabriel (ed.), D. &amp; W.
