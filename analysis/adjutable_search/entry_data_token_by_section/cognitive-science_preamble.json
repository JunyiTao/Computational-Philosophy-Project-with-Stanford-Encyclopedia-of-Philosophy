    "main_text": "\n\nCognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mind and\nintelligence, embracing philosophy, psychology, artificial\nintelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology. Its\nintellectual origins are in the mid-1950s when researchers in several\nfields began to develop theories of mind based on complex\nrepresentations and computational procedures. Its organizational\norigins are in the mid-1970s when the Cognitive Science Society was\nformed and the journal Cognitive Science began. Since then,\nmore than one hundred universities in North America, Europe, Asia, and\nAustralia have established cognitive science programs, and many others\nhave instituted courses in cognitive science.\n",
