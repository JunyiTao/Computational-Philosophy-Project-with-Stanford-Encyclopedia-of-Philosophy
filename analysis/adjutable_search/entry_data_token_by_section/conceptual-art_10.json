    "main_text": "Five Philosophical Themes || The Cognitive Value of Art\n3.5 The Cognitive Value of Art\n\nIn seeking to convey a semantic representation through a vehicular\nmedium, conceptual art arguably aims to have cognitive \u2013 rather\nthan aesthetic \u2013 value. By cognitive value, what is meant is\nsimply the value an artwork may have in virtue of enhancing or\nincreasing our understanding of some topic, notion or event.\nInterestingly, conceptual art seems to assume that the aesthetic\ndetracts from or divests art of its possible cognitive value in such a\nway as to render the two kinds of value close to mutually exclusive\n(Schellekens 2007).\n\nThe attempt to separate the aesthetic from the cognitive is far from a\nrecent investigative endeavour in philosophical circles. In the very\nfirst section of Kant\u2019s Critique of the Power of\nJudgement, a clear-cut distinction is outlined between aesthetic\nand cognitive (or \u2018logical\u2019) judgements. However, few\nartistic movements have pressed these questions about the division\nbetween aesthetic value on the one hand, and cognitive value on the\nother, as scrupulously and explicitly as conceptual art. In fact,\nconceptual art makes things very difficult for itself by holding that\nthe only kind of artistic value that is entirely legitimate\nis cognitive value.\n\nClearly, conceptual art is not the only kind of art that may have\ncognitive value \u2013 many other artforms aim to have cognitive\nvalue in addition to aesthetic value \u2013 and most of us\nwould agree that part of why we find art rewarding is precisely\nbecause it often yields some kind of understanding. That is to say, we\nread novels, look at paintings and listen to music not only because of\nthe pleasure it may afford, but also because it tends to make us\nricher human beings, better able to make sense of the world around\nus.\n\nUncontroversial as this claim may seem, some philosophers have denied\nthat art should either have or seek to have cognitive value. Most\nfamously perhaps, expressivists such as Clive Bell and Roger Fry held\nthat art should only seek to express and arouse emotions (Bell 1914;\nFry 1920). James Young has defended a view whereby\navant-garde art, like conceptual art, cannot yield any\nsignificant knowledge or understanding (Young 2001, 77).\n\nYoung\u2019s argument focuses on the notion of exemplification which\nhe locates at the heart of the only kind of semantic representation\nand cognitive value that can be ascribed to artworks such as\nconceptual ones. Exemplification is a form of reference to properties\nby means of a sample (or exemplar). An exemplar \u2018stands for some\nproperty by [non-metaphorically, literally] possessing the\nproperty\u2019 (Young 2001, 72). In the case of conceptual art, a\nwork then exemplifies an idea or concept. So, for example, Tom\nMarioni\u2019s The Act of Drinking Beer with One\u2019s Friends\nis the Highest Form of Art\n (1970)[9]\n \u2013 a piece involving the artist and his friends drinking beer\ntogether \u2013 is an exemplar of the idea at the heart of the work,\nnamely that drinking beer with one\u2019s friends is the highest\nart-form of all. This is the work\u2019s statement. However, as Young\npoints out, it doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that something\nexpresses a statement or has meaning that it has significant cognitive\nvalue. All things considered, the kind of statement that conceptual\nartworks and their like are typically able to make, according to\nYoung, are merely truisms. If conceptual art yields cognitive value,\nthat is to say, it tends to be so trivial that it barely deserves the\nname.\n\nThe argument puts a finger on an experience shared by many spectators\nof conceptual art who feel conned or deceived by it. Not only are\nconceptual artworks not beautiful, one might object, they don\u2019t\neven tell us anything over and beyond banal clich\u00e9s. What,\nthen, is conceptual art really good for?\n\nIf there is to be a way out of this difficulty, we will have to take\nthe bull by the horns and discuss exactly what (kind of) understanding\none may gain from it. This answer will have to be cashed out in terms\nof two concerns: one about the content of the knowledge, and\nanother about the kind of knowledge in question. First,\nknowledge yielded by art can be about the artwork \u2013 not only the\ntechniques employed, the work\u2019s history and tradition, and so\non, but also the meaning and thoughts that the work conveys. Second,\nart can yield either propositional knowledge or knowledge by\nacquaintance. Whereas the first consists of knowledge given to us in\nterms of propositions and can either be concerned with the artwork\nitself (e.g. knowledge \u2018that [Manet's famous painting]\nrepresents the Emperor Maximilan\u2019s execution') or a reality\nbeyond that work (e.g. knowledge \u2018that horrible things are often\ndone in the name of political revolutions\u2019), the second kind of\nknowledge has the potential to enable one to imagine what it would be\nlike to be in a certain position or situation, to empathize, to come\nvery close to experiencing what it would be like to have that kind of\nexperience first-hand (e.g. what it is like to witness the execution\nof a dishonoured Emperor).\n\nThe notions of knowledge and cognitive value, whilst at the very heart\nof the conceptual project, raise a manifold of important questions\nthat require solid and cogent philosophical answers. Perhaps\nexemplification can still serve an epistemological purpose by inviting\nus to engage with the issues raised by a work of art in a richer and\nmore imaginative way; in a way that makes us think about questions of\nphilosophical interest in particular way \u2013 a way that\npropositions alone cannot do? Perhaps the key to conceptual\nart\u2019s value lies in a more challenging intellectual relationship\nwith the work, a genuine engagement with the idea in question.\nExploring this avenue may yet help us see what kind of non-trivial\ncognitive value conceptual art is capable of yielding.\n",
