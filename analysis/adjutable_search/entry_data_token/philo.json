Whether he\nreally was a philosopher is a question still debated at length. At the\nbeginning of the Roman Empire, especially for the Stoics and the\nCynics, the fundamental task of a philosopher was the construction of\nhis own self (Foucault 2001). A man who sought to improve himself had\nto first regulate his own nature, controlling his passions and\nemotions and eliminating any gap between theory and practice. He was\nthus supposed to approach the perfection of a god. To the exact\ncontrary of this attitude, Philo\u2019s purpose was to prove the\noudeneia, the ontological nothingness of human beings. In his\nopinion, the only way to have real existence was to admit that one is\nnothing without the help of God, who is the source of freedom,\nlogos (reason) and consciousness. He aimed to be the best\npossible servant of the Revelation and of the text that forms\nGod\u2019s Word. He accepted contradiction as a normal means of\nexpression, which serves as a possible explanation for the disordered\nimpression of his treatises. He was, however, neither ignorant nor\nconfused; rather, he consciously deconstructed the rationalist\npatterns of Greek thought, which in his opinion served to affirm the\nprimacy of the self. He did not want to get rid of logos but\nrather to place it clearly within the unique perspective of divine\ntranscendence. Though he felt great admiration for Plato\n(Reydams-Schils 2008), his transcendence was not exactly Platonic, but\nrather of a God both absolutely unknowable yet very close to mankind.\nNikiprowetzky (1977) inaugurated a new era in Philonian studies by\naffirming the centrality of the Law in the Philo\u2019s thought. In\nthis perspective, philosophy was the servant of Revelation, a way to\nlend his exegesis a more universal impact by drawing upon the\ncategories of Greek logos One of the purposes of our\npresentation will be to give a plausible evaluation of the many images\nand interpretations of Philo that we find in Philonian\nscholarship.\n", "toc": [{"#ManHisWork": "1.

The Man and His Work\n1.1 Philo Alexandrinus\n\nIt is impossible to give precise dates for Philo\u2019s birth. The\nconsensus is that he lived between the end of the first century BCE\nand the middle of the first century CE, during a period of acute\nagitation and interethnic tensions in Alexandria. The Romans, with\ntheir universal ambitions, had replaced the Macedonians, leaving to\nthe Greeks only the pride of their identity and some fiscal\nadvantages. The Greeks in turn pretended to be the only citizens of\nthe city of Alexandria, refusing citizenship to the Jews with very few\nexceptions, among which was Alexander the Alabarch (tax collector),\nPhilo\u2019s brother (Bloch 2021, Siegert 2021). Alexander\u2019s\nson, in turn, became one of the famous apostates in the history of\nJudaism, becoming prefect of Egypt in 66\u201369 CE and serving as\nEmperor Titus\u2019 second-in-command at the siege of Jerusalem in 70\nCE. The history of the apostate within his family was certainly a\nproblem for Philo, who tried to raise the issue with his nephew in the\n(De providentia 2 and in the De animalibus. Though\nhe never specified his own political status, Philo was likely a\ncitizen of this prestigious city. Finally, the native Egyptians were\ndespised by both Greeks and Jews. The Egyptians didn\u2019t all\nremain passive, however; Manetho (Stern 1974, texts n.19\u201321), an\nEgyptian priest, wrote a parody of the Exodus, transforming the\nliberation of Israel into the ignominious expulsion of a disabled and\ndishonest people. This topos won great favor among Greek\nintellectuals like Philo\u2019s contemporary, Apion, against whom\nFlavius Josephus wrote his famous apology of the Jewish people. This\ntension erupted into the Alexandria riots of 38 CE, the first major\npogrom in the history of Jewish people, leading in turn to the\ninstallation of a ghetto, murders, tortures, humiliations, and\nmockeries of Agrippa I, the king of Judaea (van der Horst 2003). We\nmust keep all this in mind in order not to imagine Philo merely as a\nscholar burrowed away in the Great Library, nor as a rabbi lecturing\npeacefully in the synagogues. In Spec. 3.1, he wistfully\nremembers a time when he could devote himself to study and\ncontemplation, probably before the disasters of 38 CE: \n\n\nThere was a time when I had leisure for philosophy and for the\ncontemplation of the universe and its contents, when I made its spirit\nmy own in all its beauty and loveliness and true blessedness, when my\nconstant companions were divine themes and verities, when I rejoiced\nwith a joy that never cloyed or sated. \n\n\nBut just after, he evokes the violent envy of those who plunged him\n\u201cin[to] the ocean of civil cares\u201d, likely an allusion to\nthe many difficulties created by the hostility of Greeks and Egyptians\n(Spec. 3.1). Even before this violence, however, the\nenvironment he faced was a hostile and resentful one. Philo considered\nthe Egyptians, his \u201cultimate other\u201d (Niehoff 2001), the\nmost disgusting of polytheists because of their zoolatry. He was full\nof reverence and fear toward the Romans, or at least pretends as such\nin his two books on the pogrom of 38 CE: the In Flaccum,\nwhich is against the Roman prefect in Alexandria at the moment of the\npogrom, and the Legatio (Smallwood 1961) in which he narrates\nhis own experience of the embassy sent to the Emperor Caligula by the\nJews of Alexandria after the riot. Recently Niehoff stressed the idea\nthat Roman culture had become an important element of Philo\u2019s\nidentity (Niehoff 2018). Nevertheless, he was first and foremost a Jew\nof the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Bible (ca 270\nBCE). That is to say, however distinctive his views, he was a\nsincerely pious Jew. He knew very little Hebrew, though he went to\nJerusalem to pray and offer sacrifices in the Temple (Prov.\n2.107), and he thought that the Bible written in Greek was perfectly\nequivalent to the Hebrew one (Mos. 2.40). His\npaideia or Greek education was excellent, both in philosophy\nand the liberal arts, as he says in Congr. 79\u201380: \n\n\nFor instance when first I was incited by the goads of philosophy to\ndesire her I consorted in early youth with one of her handmaids,\nGrammar, and all that I begat by her, writing, reading and study of\nthe writings of the poets, I dedicated to her mistress.\n\n\nBy this period in Alexandria, the spirit of mutual comprehension that\nmarked the beginning of the Ptolemaic epoch (ca 332\nBCE\u201330 BCE) had faded away. In his own person, Philo brought\ntogether two elements that the Greek elite now held to be\nincompatible: paideia, Greek education, and Judaism. He\nstudied and commented on the Bible in the synagogues, which he\ndescribes as \u201cschools of virtue\u201d. His understanding of\nrhetoric was not merely theoretical. He was probably a great orator.\nThe addressees of his treatises were foremost the Jews, both believers\nand unbelievers. He may have had a second, much more hypothetical,\naudience in mind as well: Greek philosophers and intellectuals more\ngenerally. However, to the best of our knowledge, this latter group\npaid scant attention to Philo\u2019s writings. In the fragments of\nGreek and Roman writers carefully collected by Menahem Stern (1974),\nwe find two kinds of Greek reactions towards Judaism. In the earlier\nperiod, they received some sympathy from philosophers; Theophrastus,\nthe main disciple of Aristotle, writes in a famous fragment that Jews\nare \u201cphilosophers by race\u201d, saying about them: \n\n\nthey converse with each other about the deity, and at night-time they\nmake observations of the stars, gazing at them and calling on God by\nprayer. (quoted in Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica,\n40.3.1\u20133) \n\n\nFrom the end of the second century BCE, however, many philosophers\nwere active propagandists for\n antisemitism.[1]\n One might have expected that Stoicism, with its cosmopolitism and\nrational humanism, would have avoided this kind of attitude. In fact,\nas we can see in Posidonius, Seneca, or Chaeremon, Stoic antisemitism\nwas a product not of racism, but of an erroneous understanding of\nrationalism and universalism. For these men, the Jews were a very\nsuperstitious nation, blemished by strange habits and strong animosity\ntowards foreigners. Except for the case of Varro, the Roman scholar of\nthe first century BCE who appreciated Jews for their refusal of images\n(Lehmann 1997), it would be impossible to give an example of a Greek\nor Latin text of this period showing sympathy or even interest toward\nthe Jews. This was a condition of which Philo could not have been\nignorant. In the background of his life and of his work lay an\nantisemitism growing more and more violent. In contrast to Flavius,\nwho decades later wrote the Against Apion in order to refute\nGreek antisemitism, Philo seems to have preferred to extol the virtues\nof Judaism than to fight against the adversaries of Jews, as we can\nsee in the extant fragments of his Hypotetica.\n1.2 His works\n\nPhilo\u2019s work does not form a well-organized corpus. During\nPhilo\u2019s time, the work was larger than the corpus we now have.\nThe relation of Philo to the Hebrew exegetical traditions of his time\nis an important and controversial question. One of the major paradoxes\nfor his posterity is that his work was ignored by Jews and saved by\nChristians, some of whom thought that he was himself a Christian\n(Runia 2009). In 233 CE the entire corpus was brought to Caesarea, a\ncity that became the main center of its transmission, though some\npapyri suggest the circulation of at least some of his treatises in\nEgypt. The more or less generally accepted classification is that of\nMassebiau (1889), completed by Cohn (1899). It is divided into five\nprincipal categories:\n\nAllegorical commentaries (39 treatises)\nTwelve treatises of exposition of the law (12 treatises)\nQuestions and answers on Genesis and Exodus (6\ntreatises)\nFour historical and apologetic treatises (4 treatises)\nFive philosophical treatises\n\n\nNo definite chronology of the works was established until the very\nrecent book of Niehoff (2018). Philo gives very few hints regarding\nhis process of composition, offering only a few remarks about the\nstructure and divisions of his treatises. Regarding the strange fact\nthat these Greek treatises bear Latin titles, Monique Alexandre (1997)\nconducted a complete study in which she examines a complex\nphilological process from Antiquity to the nineteenth century through\nthe humanists of the Renaissance and their immediate successors.\n2. Philosophy, Philosophers, and Rhetoric\n2.1 Philosophical works\n\nOn the meaning of philosophy for Philo, see see the supplement on\n The Meanings of Philosophy in Philo of Alexandria.\n His five philosophical works are De providentia 1 and 2,\nDe animalibus, De aeternitate and Quod omnis\nprobus. The two latter works are the only ones for which we have\nGreek texts. With the exception of a few rare references to the Bible,\nthese texts could well have been written by a pagan philosopher. This\nis why some scholars thought they were products of Philo\u2019s\npaideia, his classical Greek education. Today, there is a\ntendency to believe that Philo\u2019s extant texts were written near\nthe end of his life. If this is the case, the reason for writing, in\nthe atmosphere of great cultural and political rivalry of the epoch,\ncould have been to demonstrate that a Jew was as able to compose a\nphilosophy as \u201cpure\u201d as any Greek. In any case, the most\ndiscussed problem today is the skepticism regarding the authenticity\nof the De aeternitate, the treatise in which we find the most\nexplicit references to philosophy and philosophers. Since\nRunia\u2019s seminal article in 1981, a majority of scholars seems to\nhave distanced themselves from thinking the text is inauthentic. For\nRunia, there is no contradiction in the fact that Philo goes against\nthe biblical tradition and defends the eternity of the world not only\nin the future but also in the past. The second part of Philo\u2019s\ntreatise, now lost, would have contained the refutation of this\nunorthodox\u2014at least from a Jewish point of view\u2014thesis. It\nis probable that Philo, who seems to have had good knowledge of\nskeptical methods, was trained to argue both pro and\ncontra of a thesis, a dialectical technique of which the\nDe aeternitate is probably the best illustration. We will\nreturn to the question of the authenticity in the supplemenary\ndocument\n About the De aeternitate and the De providentia.\n2.2 Philosophers\n2.2.1 Jewish philosophers\n\nWe have little information about Jewish intellectuals in the\nHellenistic epoch. One of our main sources is the Sentences\nof Pseudo-Phocylides (Barclay 2007), most likely written in Alexandria\nby a Jew. They show an interesting mix of Jewish and Greek elements:\nan absence of attacks against polytheism, some popular Stoic themes,\nand a rather soft affirmation of the monotheistic faith. It is not\neasy, however, to date these Sentences. The most probable\ndate would be somewhere between 30 BCE and 40 CE, but other dates are\npossible. Regardless, the Sentences provides an image of what\ncould have been a Jewish openness towards pagan culture if relations\nwere calmer. According to a well-attested tradition, some Jews posited\nthat Plato had taken his inspiration from Moses, an idea that seems to\nhave been popularized by Aristobulus of Paneas, a Jewish philosopher\nwho lived in the first half of second century BCE. Philo, who lived in\na more unstable period, employs this kind of assertion with prudence\n(Spec. 2.164\u2013167). He himself sometimes alludes to his\nimmediate predecessors, which is the topic of Goulet\u2019s book\n(1987). Goulet\u2019s central thesis is that the primary source of\nPhilo\u2019s allegories was a Jewish commentary that used Stoic\nmethods of interpretation to attempt a wholly rationalist exegesis of\nthe Bible devoid of any notion of transcendence. In fact, there is\nonly one clear allusion to these phusiologoi, i.e.,\nrationalist allegorists. It is likely that in Alexandria there were\nJews who attempted to interpret the Bible as the Stoics had\ninterpreted Homer (Niehoff 2011). It is unclear whether their\ninterpretation was integrated into a comprehensive system of\nrationalism. The allegoric interpretation did not prevent Stoics from\ndefending divination, a practice that was considered absurd by their\nopponents. One could add that this evolution towards a more religious\ncast of mind was not a distinctive characteristic of Philo, but rather\na hallmark of the Middle-Platonist period as a whole.\n2.2.2 Greek philosophers\n\nNamed references to philosophers in Philo\u2019s work are rather\nrare, and often the cited names are not those that one would expect.\nFor example, he never mentions Posidonius, one of the greatest names\nof Stoicism, who was the first to attempt a reconciliation of at least\nsome Stoic and Platonic themes. There are reasons to think Philo read\nthis Rhodian philosopher, but he is silent about Posidonius. One could\nsurmise that his clearly anti-Jewish position was one possible reason\nfor Philo\u2019s silence. However, Philo is also silent regarding\nthinkers of the New Academy, Arcesilas and Carneades. He was clearly\nacquainted with these Academics, since there are some rather clear\nallusions in his work to their brand of skepticism. It is therefore\ncurious that he gives the first version of the Skeptical tropes\nwithout any allusion to Aenesidemus, who developed them a century\nbefore. Leaving aside the contested De aeternitate, we notice\nthat Philo fails to mention Aristotle even once. While Stoicism plays\na leading though complex role in most Philonian treatises, we only\nfind four allusions to Zeno, the founder of the doctrine. They are all\nin the Probus, a treatise with strong Stoic features. There\nis only a single mention of Epicurus, in Post. 2. Plato is\nmentioned twice each in the De opificio and the De uita\ncontemplativa, and once in the Probus. Only three\nmentions of Socrates are found, but surprisingly, the presocratic\nthinkers are quoted much more than one would have thought: fourteen\nreferences to Pythagoras (with some uncertainties, since some of them\nare to be found in fragments), six to Heraclitus, and one each to\nAnaxagoras and Democritus. The De aeternitate is striking\nbecause Aristotle is mentioned four times. In this treatise, Philo\ncites a book written by the Pythagorean Ocellos of Lucania, who\nestablished the eternity of the world in a way that Philo seems to\nfind satisfactory. This, notably, is the only time when he mentions a\nspecific text and explicitly affirms having read it.\n\nOne might wonder whether there is a logic to Philo\u2019s explicit\nreferences to philosophers.\n\nSeveral elements point us toward a more complete understanding. First,\nPhilo evidently prefers indirect allusions to direct citations.\nPhilosophical concepts are necessary to the elaboration of exegesis,\nbut too many precise mentions of philosophers would have presented\nPhilo himself as subordinate not to the Word of God but to the\ndoctrines of philosophers. He is still more silent about the great\nrabbis he would have certainly met in Alexandria and perhaps in\nJerusalem. In his philosophical references, it is clear that he\nprefers to evoke the presocratic thinkers and the classical period of\nphilosophy than the Hellenistic one. This is paradoxical since he was\ndeeply marked by Hellenistic philosophy, which was the natural\nenvironment of his education. It must be added that his prose is also\ngenerally classical, reluctant to admit neologisms and technical\nvocabulary. He certainly wanted to appear in all areas a man of\ntradition.\n2.2.3 \u201cBarbarian\u201d philosophers\n\nDid Philo think that philosophy was a Greek monopoly, only shared with\nsome Jews?\n\nIn recent years, the temptation has been great among some scholars to\nimagine that he had at least some knowledge of non-Greek thinkers such\nas Cicero and Seneca (L\u00e9vy 2021). The problem remains that we\nhave no evidence of this hypothesis. Philo never evoked Roman\nphilosophers, so we cannot pass beyond statements of probability. More\ngenerally, what can be said about Philo\u2019s attitude towards\n\u201cbarbarian\u201d wisdom can be summarized in three points:\n\n\n\nJewish wisdom surpasses all other wisdom, both Greek and barbarian,\nbecause it is the only one inspired by God. In Mos. 2.12,\nPhilo makes no attempt to hide that when the Bible was first\ntranslated into Greek, the Word of God was considered by many an\nexpression of barbarian wisdom. The Septuagint is implicitly presented\nas proof that the distinction between Greek and barbarian could be\nabolished, though for Greek civilization this distinction had great\nontological weight.\n\n\nEven Greek education, despite its exceptional prestige, is unable to\nprovide access to the truth. A learned man according to the criterion\nof the paideia is no more able than anyone else to say what\nthe world truly is.\n\n\nPhilo did not deny that barbarians were able to create sophisticated\nforms of sciences and culture. Despite his own contempt for the\nEgyptians, he stresses that Moses himself received an education in\nwhich Egyptian sciences were included. Furthermore, he argues that\nmany barbarians, though untutored in philosophy, have a natural\nintuition of how to live in agreement with virtue. In Somn.\n2.56, the Indian ascetics (\u201cgymnosophists\u201d) appear as the\nbarbarian form of the Cynic life, lacking any form of luxury or\nmaterial comfort, and in Probus 96, the letter of the ascetic\nCalanos to Alexander [now known to be fake] provides the best evidence\nthat some barbarians could practice a perfectly philosophical life\nwithout ever having received a Greek education.\n\n2.2.4 Philosophy and rhetoric\n\nThrough the many studies Manuel Alexandre Jr (1999) devoted to\nPhilo\u2019s rhetoric, we can more precisely gauge Philo\u2019s\nposition in this central debate within Greek culture: the conflict\nbetween philosophy and rhetoric, or better, between philosophers and\nrhetors. Philo displays a sound knowledge of rhetoric. His affinity\nwith Platonism impelled him to address very harsh critics of the\n\u201clesser\u201d rhetoric, that of sophists, who represent the\nopposite pole of his own thought (Filler 2016). Sophisteia,\nsophistry, is in Philo a frequent concept attached to a range of\nnegative meanings. But, as in Plato (where Socrates opposes the idea\nof a greater rhetoric to Gorgias\u2019 lesser rhetoric in the\nPhaedrus), in Philo we see the possibility of a positive use\nof rhetoric. For Philo, rhetoric is neither an activity nor an\nabstract ideal but a human reality, the nature of which is laid out in\nthe Bible. Moses is the man who saw God in the Sinai, but he by\nhimself would have been unable to speak to Pharaoh and persuade him to\nlet his people go. Moses needed the presence of Aaron in order to\nobtain what he sought. Moses represents the metaphysical truth, Aaron\nits implementation in reality, akin to the two faces of\nlogos: while the logos prophorikos is that of\ncommunication, the logos endiathetos is the internal world of\nthoughts, and each is impossible without the other. It can be added\nthat Abraham is said by Philo (Mut. 66) to have been the\n\u201cfather of the sounds\u201d, a strange expression that,\nalongside many similar allusions to music, shows that Philo was not\nthe philosopher of sight alone. Another path of research is that of\nparr\u00easia, a complex term of political origin that\nappeared in the context of the Athenian democracy. In literary and\nphilosophical texts, it means freedom of speech, frankness, and\nhonesty. For Philo, however, parr\u00easia is neither a\npolitical ideal nor an individual achievement, but something given by\nGod; and it must be used without harming relatives or friends.\n3. Philo and Philosophical Schools\n\nFor us it is clear that Philo never had a philosophical affiliation.\nTo say that he was a Pythagorean, a Platonist, or a Stoic would have\nbeen for him to admit that he sought truth in spaces outside the\nBible. Was he an Eclectic (Mansfeld 1988)? The concept of eclecticism\nis a complicated one. If it means that Philo used different\nphilosophers as sources of inspiration and expression in order to\nelaborate his work, this cannot be denied. On the other hand, if one\nmeans that he built a specific philosophical identity for himself by\nassociating with different doctrines, that seems far from the truth.\nIt would mean that he was in search of an autonomous ego, a\nperspective at odds with his denial of the possibility for an\nindividual to exist truly on his own, i.e., without God\u2019s help.\nMore exactly, if Philo asserted his own individuality, it was in the\nfree modification and criticism of all philosophical doctrines around\nhim, sometimes using them as their creators would never have imagined\npossible.\n3.1 Philo and Aristotelianism\n\nAs Roskam (2011: 35) underscored, \n\n\nthe period of Middle Platonism is particularly interesting because it\nis in this period that Aristotle begins to receive more and more\nattention in the circles of a systematised Platonism. \n\n\nThis does not mean that the rivalry between Platonists and\nAristotelians was over, but rather that Aristotle, who seems to have\nbeen largely ignored by Neo-Academic philosophers during the\nHellenistic period (but Weische 1961), emerged again as a reference\nand a point of discussion. Philo is full of praise towards the\nStagirite in the De aeternitate, a puzzling text. He was\nhimself a Creationist while Aristotle asserted the eternity of the\nworld. This does not mean that his admiration was unbounded,\nespecially if the original treatise had been in the form of an\nantilogy, a disputatio in utramque partem. Today, some\nscholars try to demonstrate that Aristotle, more than Plato, lay at\nthe core of Philo\u2019s thought (Bos 2009). It can be objected that\nthe dogmatic Academic Antiochus of Ascalon (ca\n140/130\u201360 BCE), a philosopher that Philo certainly had read,\ndid much to intertwine Platonic, Stoic, and Aristotelian ideas (Sedley\n2012). The influence of Antiochus on the Alexandrian philosophical\nmilieu is a controversial question. Despite the efforts of Andronicus\nof Rhodes (first editor of the Aristotelian corpus) to organize the\ncorpus, some of the texts used Aristotelian elements in a spirit quite\ndifferent from what we now understand by Aristotelianism. This can\nshed light on our understanding of Philo\u2019s Aristotelianism and\non the comparison of his Aristotelian passages with the\npseudo-Aristotelian ones, a point on which many have commented.\nAntiochus was not the only one to shift the borders between these\ndoctrines. The Stoic Posidonius also played a role in Philo\u2019s\nelaboration of an unorthodox form of Aristotelianism.\n\nEven if one is persuaded of the authenticity of Philo\u2019s\nAristotelianism in the De aeternitate mundi, the compliments\ntowards Aristotle at the beginning of the treatise are surprising and\ndo not exactly fit within the traditional frame of a disputatio\npro and contra. The most probable thesis was put in\nsecond position, as we can see in the Ciceronian antilogy on justice\nin the third book of the De re publica. Another ambiguity is\nthat Aristotle is praised here for having referred to the visible God,\nwhile Philo says many times elsewhere that God is invisible. Of this\noddity two contradictory interpretations may be given: either Philo\nmeans that Aristotle as a philosopher is what Israel is among the\nnations, the one able to see God, an etymology of which Philo is fond;\nor the reference to the \u201cvisible God\u201d, without any\nreference to His essence, means that Aristotle is only able to see the\nvisible aspects of Him. This would be an implicit criticism of the\nStagirite\u2019s incapacity to perceive God\u2019s transcendental\nand divine Nature.\n\nThe above is but one example of the difficulties inherent to the\ninterpretation of Aristotelian elements in Philo\u2019s corpus, at\nleast regarding cosmological and metaphysical problems. Things are\nperhaps clearer concerning Aristotle\u2019s influence on\nPhilo\u2019s ethics. The term mesot\u00e8s (middle way),\nwhich has special importance in Aristotelian ethics, is used by Philo\nonce, in Migr. 147. In this passage, the Alexandrine argues\nthat the \u201croyal road\u201d is the middle way. But this\nassertion is not an unrestricted sign of approval of Aristotle\u2019s\nethics. In the desert, there is no way at all\u2014and the desert was\nthe exact place where Israel received the Revelation and achieved its\nliberty. The middle way may play a positive role in reining in\ndebauchery, but for Philo, it has no absolute value. In Leg.\n3.20, Laban asks Jacob why he fled instead of remaining faithful to\nthe doctrine that recognizes the goods of the body and external\npossessions. Here is evidence of Philo\u2019s refusal to accept\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of the three kinds of goods. In\nDet. 8, it is said that corporeal and external goods are\nassets in name only, and in Somn. 2.9, he criticizes those\nwho upheld the tripartition of human goods and contrasts them with\nthose for whom virtue was the only good. To summarize, Philo could\noccasionally borrow some elements of Peripatetic doctrine, but he\nnever believed them to be an expression of higher truth. He reveals a\nparticular sort of coherence with regard to Aristotelianism: it\nconsists in demonstrating through exegesis that Aristotle\u2019s\nprudent philosophy could not entirely coincide with the Bible\u2019s\nspiritual wisdom.\n3.2 Stoicism\n\nPhilo was probably the non-Stoic thinker who most frequently drew upon\nboth Stoic themes and vocabulary. Many scholars have noticed the\nstrong influence of Stoicism on Philo, and he is described frequently\nas a Platonizing Stoic. However, matters are a bit more complex. Given\nhis Jewish faith, he couldn\u2019t refuse the Stoic conception of a\nperfectly organized world in which mankind had a privileged status\namong all other living creatures. One can add that the specific\nvocabulary of Stoicism had become a kind of lingua franca of\nintellectual discourse, used even by those who had no special\naffinity with the Stoics. At the same time, Philo was aware that the\nStoic refusal of transcendence created an unbridgeable gap between his\nown spiritual identity and Stoicism. There is a huge debt of Philo\ntowards Stoicism, but at the same time, he could claim to have repaid\nthis debt by bringing Stoicism in the direction of truth. Philo never\nsays exactly the same things as the Stoics. Despite their apparent\nsimilarities, there always remains a difference\u2013sometimes barely\nperceptible, but always highly significant\u2014between his doctrines\nand those of the Stoics. These differences can be distributed into\nfour categories:\n\n\n\nDoctrinal differences: for the Stoics, logos was\nequally reason (individual and universal), nature, and God, while for\nPhilo, logos is not ultimate reality but merely what we can\nsee and understand of God, who is Himself very far from human\ncomprehension (Calabi 2008). In Stoicism, logos is God; in\nPhilo it corresponds to his specific doctrine of the\ndunameis, the powers of God who created the world and governs\nit.\n\n\nAn inverse relation between the individual and the universal:\nfor Stoic philosophers, natural law is the logos in its\nfunction of commanding what must be done or avoided. No particular\nhuman law corresponds with the natural law, though Cicero tried to\ndemonstrate that Roman religious law could coincide at least partly\nwith the law of nature. In Philo\u2019s thought, the Torah is\ndescribed as containing many elements of natural law, and its claims\nto universality were concretized in the Greek of the\nSeptuagint.\n\n\nThe refusal of essential Stoic concepts: Philo only uses the\nword sunkatathesis twice in his entire corpus, a key term\ndefining the human ability to accept or refuse information given by\nthe senses and the capacity to transform decisions into action. He\nuses sometimes oikei\u00f4sis, another Stoic keyword, but\nnever with the meaning the Stoics lent to this concept. In brief,\nStoic oikei\u00f4sis expresses the idea that Nature gives to\nevery living being from birth an indication of what its supreme\npurpose in life will be. In the case of mankind, things are a little\nmore complex. The first impulse is, as in the case of all animals, the\nimpulse to survive, but after this comes the impulse toward a rational\nlife, a privilege that human beings alone share with God. All this was\nunacceptable to Philo, both the idea that human beings could at their\nbirth be submitted to the same law as animals, and the definition of\ntelos, the supreme human good (Besnier 1999), as the capacity\nof making choices in accordance with nature. It must be added that\nPhilo only uses the term \u201cprokopt\u00f4n\u201d (a progressing in ethics)\nas an exegetic tool. This absence can be interpreted as an argument\nagainst the thesis of a late conversion to stoIcism (L\u00e9vy 2021\nvs Niehoff 2018).\n\n\nSubstitutions and additions: It has been correctly observed\nthat psychology, and especially psychology of the passions (Weisser\n2021), is one of the fields in which Stoic influence is most visible\nin the Philonian corpus (Reydams Schils 2008). It is perfectly true\nthat he employs many Stoic elements in his psychological commentaries,\nbut in contrast to Chrysippean monistic doctrine, Philo never insists\nthat the soul could be exclusively rational. Philo\u2019s own stance\nis to invoke a Platonic dualism when arguing that the soul is exiled\nin the body and consequently in the world, and invoke Stoic\npsychological descriptions when describing the multiplicity of mental\nactivities. Because he used these two levels\u2014one metaphysical\nand ethical, the other descriptive and functionalist\u2014he could\ngive the impression of having avoided the contradictions between the\ntwo doctrines.\n\n3.3 From Scepticism to Pythagorean Platonism\n\nBr\u00e9hier, a great French name in Philonian studies, wrote that\nPhilo\u2019s thoughts aligned much closer to Platonism than to\nSkepticism (Br\u00e9hier 1908 [1925: 214]). That assertion is\ncharacteristic of an epoch in which these two doctrines were\nconsidered to be radically different. More recent studies have\ndemonstrated that things are much more complex. Middle Platonist\nphilosophers like Plutarch, Favorinus, or Alcinoos integrated many\nelements of Skepticism to their dogmas (Bonazzi 2007), especially in\norder to undermine Hellenistic naturalism and redirect attention to an\nidea of transcendence. Philo himself knew the existence of two kinds\nof Skepticism: New Academic and Neopyrrhonian (L\u00e9vy 2008). The\nformer school seems to have disappeared as a structured institution by\nhis lifetime. The latter came to prominence in the middle of the first\ncentury BCE, with Enesidemus criticizing New Academic philosophers,\nand especially those of his age, on the grounds that they had conceded\nfar too much to Stoic dogma. Philo seems to have paid little attention\nto New Academic sceptics, but was acquainted at least with some of\ntheir principal doctrines. By contrast, he is the first to have used\nthe tropes, i.e., the system of Sceptic arguments, elaborated by\nEnesidemus, which remained for centuries a kind of manifesto of\nSkepticism. At the beginning of the twentieth century and for many\nyears after, scholars paid great attention to the passage of the\nDe ebrietate where Philo uses these tropes. Today, however,\nit is commonplace to say that the connection was a weak one, and that\nPhilo had his own interests instead. Of course he did, but Sextus\nEmpircus himself, now considered the most reliable source, had his own\ninterests as well as being a physician, and it is rash at least to\nneglect the Philonian testimony, closer to Enesidemus from both a\ngeographical and chronological point of view. Philo uses Sceptic\nmethods to demonstrate that even with the aid of education, the\npaideia of which he was so proud, human beings are unable to\nfind the truth. Skepticism thus appears as the best means to awaken\nmankind to its oudeneia and to open the path toward\ntranscendence.\n\n\u201cWas Philo a Middle Platonist?\u201d is the title David Runia\ngave to one of his articles (1993). There is at least one point of\nconsensus among the scholars, i.e., that Philo\u2019s Platonism\naccurately reflected the Platonist interpretations circulating in\nAlexandria at the time. Very useful comparisons have been made with\nEudorus, a contemporary and compatriot, and with Plutarch. It is most\nprobable that Pythagoreanism played a great role in Philo\u2019s\ndevelopment of negative theology; it certainly did so in his doctrine\nof the first principle. At the same time, Philo makes extensive use of\nPlato as well despite the difficulty of reconciling this doctrine with\nmore classical Platonic themes. The presence of the Timaeus\nin the De opificio mundi is massive, as demonstrated by Runia\n(2001). Philo\u2019s many allusions to the theme of\n\u201cassimilation to God\u201d prove how conscious he was of the\ndifference between Stoic immanence and Platonic transcendence. At the\ncore of Stoic ethics lay the concept of oikei\u00f4sis,\nwhich required both adaptation to Nature and absolute obedience to her\nguidance. The word oikei\u00f4sis derives from\noikos, meaning house. The goal of a Stoic\u2019s life was to\nknow every hidden recess of \u201cNature\u2019s house\u201d and to\ndwell respectfully therein. On the contrary, for Middle Platonists who\nwere readers and commentators of the Theaetetus, the goal was\nto depart from nature, a dwelling of sensations and injustice, in\norder to become as similar as possible to God. Another major theme\nthat Philo shares with other Middle Platonists is that of Ideas as\ndivine thoughts, one of the features of Imperial Platonism (Dillon\n1996). Unlike Plato in the Timaeus, Philo does not assert\nthat the Ideas are exterior to the Creator. For him God is, through\nhis logos, the only active cause. The world of the Ideas, the\nno\u00e8tos kosmos, is that of God\u2019s thoughts.\nDespite many nuances, variations, and even contradictions, there is in\nPhilo the same triple structure common to many Middle Platonic texts:\nthe God/Demiurge, the first principle; the Ideas and powers by which\nGod acts on matter; and matter itself. However, it must be added that\nin Philo everything is both similar and different. His God is not the\nDemiurge; he does not define powers and Ideas with reference to\nmathematical principles, though arithmology is quite present in his\ncommentaries; and his conception of matter, despite many allusions to\nthe philosophical doctrine of the dyad (the formless and unlimited\nbase), has deep Biblical roots. \n\nIt may be useful at this point to address the question of Pythagorean\ninfluence on Philo. In Probus 2, he speaks of the\n\u201choliest sect\u201d of the Pythagoreans, a highly admiring\nexpression. In fact, the quite numerous mentions of this\n\u201csect\u201d in his treatises are a confirmation of his\nfascination for it. He admires Pythagorean elitism (Probus\n2), and sees in the ban against pronouncing their Master\u2019s name\nsomething akin to the Jewish idea of divine ineffability (QG\n1.99). He explicitly mentions twice Pythagorean sources: in\nAet. 2, where he says, as we have seen, that he read a\ntreatise of Ocellus; and in Opif. 100, there is a complex\npassage about the number seven, likened by the Pythagoreans to Zeus,\nthe \u201cDirector and Ruler of all things\u201d. In QG\n2.12, arithmology is explicitly evoked as a Pythagorean science.\nNevertheless, his allusions to Pythagorean themes are often vague and\nmerit further analysis. As an example, Philo is often willing to use\nadjectives by which Pythagoreans characterized the dyad but reluctant\nto use the word itself. And when he does so, he clarifies in a very\npersonal manner that \u201cthe monad is the image of the\nfirst Cause\u201d and the dyad that of \u201cthe matter passive and\nindivisible\u201d (Spec. 3.180). Monad and dyad serve Philo\nas exegetical tools, not actual substitutes for the narrative of\nCreation in the Bible. It is as if the imperative not to coincide\nexactly with Greek philosophical doctrine was for Philo an obligation\nof identity.\n3.4 Epicureanism\n\nEvidently, Philo felt no sympathy towards Epicureanism (L\u00e9vy,\nRanocchia 2008), an exclusively materialistic doctrine which denied\nthe existence of Providence and defined pleasure both as the first\nmotivator of human actions and as the supreme good. As if this was not\nenough, Epicureans also described gods as taking human form, which was\nfor Philo an indisputable case of idolatry. Nevertheless, his attitude\ntowards Epicureanism is at times more complex than one might expect.\nIn the first instance, his condemnation of Epicureanism is clear. In\nthe same sentence at Post. 2, he castigates Epicurean impiety\nalongside Egyptian atheism. In De providentia as well we find\nstrong elements of a refutation of Epicurean denial of Providence. And\nin Aet. 6\u20138, he draws a clear contrast between\nEpicureans who believe in the genesis and dissolution of worlds\ncreated by the chance of atomic collisions, and the Stoics, who\ndespite being materialists themselves, claim that the world is single\nand governed by Reason. In addition, atomism becomes an allegorical\ninstrument in the splendid exegesis of Moses killing the Egyptian\n(Fug. 148), where this episode becomes the symbol of the\nconfrontation between the doctrines of unity and of extreme\nfragmentation. The Egyptian, who symbolizes pleasure, is buried in the\nsand, symbol of atoms. Nothing in all this is truly unexpected. More\nsurprising, however, is the inclusion of the most complete exposition\nof the Epicurean version of oikei\u00f4sis in Opif.\n161, the doctrine of first adaptation to nature, probably of Stoic\norigin but also adopted by other schools. Moreover, despite many\nappearances, Philo does not consider pleasure an absolute evil. For\nhim, it has a place in the divine program of Creation since it plays\nan essential role in procreation. The error lay with those who would\ntransform a relative good into a perfect one.\n4. Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo\n4.1 Allegory\n\nPhilo\u2019s name has almost become a byword for allegory (Sellin\n2011). There are many arguments to defend this association, but it\nwould be an error to affirm that he was merely an allegorist. In many\npassages he defines with precision what can be called his methodology\nof allegory. In Praem. 61\u201365, he says that there are\nsecret meanings, reachable only with God\u2019s help. He\ndistinguishes three cases by which a secret meaning may be\nascertained: (a) directly by divine illumination, or (b1) indirectly\nin the shadow of literal interpretation, and/or (b2) by allegorical\ninterpretation. It must be added that he not only uses the word\nallegoria, but also uponoia, a Platonic term which\nby this time may have been somewhat archaic. The two terms are not\nexactly synonymous for him. In Opif. 157, he posits that\nBiblical tales are not the kind of myths in which poets and sophists\nrejoice but are in fact \u201cindications of character types which\ninvite allegorical interpretation through the explanation of hidden\nmeanings\u201d. Nevertheless, according to Philo, it is an error to\nexclude literal meanings. As he notes in Migr. 89\u201393,\n\n\n\nthere are some who, regarding laws in their literal sense in the light\nof symbols of matters belonging to the intellect, are over punctilious\nabout the latter, while treating the former with easy-going neglect.\nSuch men I for my part should blame for handling the matter in too\neasy and off-hand a manner: they ought to have given careful attention\nto both aims, to a more full and exact investigations of what is not\nseen and in what is seen to be stewards without reproach. \n\n\nFor him, allegory assumes importance when literal interpretation\nencounters difficulty, for example, when it suggests conclusions in\ncontradiction with God\u2019s absolute perfection. In Leg.\n2.19, he does not hesitate to say that the creation of Eve from one of\nAdam\u2019s ribs was a most improbable myth, if taken literally. It\nbecomes likely only if one understands that \u201cribs\u201d are in\nfact the powers of Adam\u2019s mind. It has been amply demonstrated\nthat Philo\u2019s use of allegory was not born ex nihilo.\nFor example, an allegorical interpretation of the garment of the high\npriest (Mos. 2.117) as a microcosmic reproduction of the\nuniverse is found in Wisdom of Solomon 18:24, probably written at the\nend of the first century BCE. This suggests a Jewish source. On the\nother hand, many examples evince Philo\u2019s perfect knowledge of\nGreek allegories in the interpretation of Homeric and Hesiodic myths.\nHe does not hesitate to evoke some of these by name. For example,\nspeaking about the earth in Aet. 63, he says that she was\nrightly called Pandora, since she gives to living things all that is\nuseful. In Greek d\u00f4ron means a present. The allegorical\ninterpretation is here based on etymology, as are those of the\ngreatest Stoic allegorist of the imperial period, Cornutus.\nResearchers have recently shown great interest in Philo\u2019s\nlinguistic remarks. Most of the time, however, he adapts classical\nallegorical interpretations to a Jewish context. For example, in\nConf. 170 he quotes Homer, Iliad 2.204\u2013205,\ntwo verses in which the poet praises the power of a single man. Philo\ndenies that this should be interpreted as a general principle of\npolitics; under his own interpretation, it is instead a poetic\nreference to almighty God. In one of his most famous passages, Philo\ninterprets the tale of Mambre, in Genesis 18:1\u201315, where Abraham\nreceives three men he initially believed to be foreigners. The author\nreminds his readers (QG 4.2) that Homer, who in recounting\nOdysseus\u2019 homecoming, says that gods often disguise themselves\nin order not to be immediately recognized by humans (Odyssey\n17.483\u2013487).\n\nA central problem in Philo\u2019s use of allegory is the nature of\nthe debt he owes to those he calls fusikoi. Since he evokes\nthem regarding the interpretation of some Biblical difficulties, they\nwere most likely Jewish exegetes using Stoic methods in which, at\nleast at that time, etymology played a strong role. For Long (1992),\nthere is a big difference between Stoic \u201callegory\u201d, based\non etymological and, more generally, linguistic bases, and the\nallegories of Philo. Stoic allegoresis, he says, \n\n\nwas not an attempt like [Philo\u2019s], to distinguish figurative\nfrom literal meaning, but an effort to normalize language and remove\nambiguity according to their own understanding of the empirical world.\n(1992 [1996: 210]) \n\n\nIn fact, the problem of the exact nature of Stoic allegoresis is\ncontroversial. It can be remarked that Philo\u2019s allegory is not\nmerely symbolic. Especially when mentioning the fusikoi, he\nhimself draws upon etymology, for example, about Sara whose name in\nthe Chaldean language (i.e., in Hebrew) means \u201cthe ruler\u201d\n(Abr. 99), and for whom nothing is more dominant than virtue\n(80). If it is probable that in Alexandria at this time there were a\ngreat variety of allegorists blending literary, philosophical, and\nspiritual currents, then we can say that Philo was very skillful in\ndrawing upon each of these. To this observation, let us add a\nPhilonian conception of allegory that appears not to have interested\nlater scholars: in his interpretation of one of Joseph\u2019s dreams\nin Somn. 2.8, Philo states that he will follow the method of\nallegory which he calls a \u201cwise architect\u201d. This\nexpression is a \u201chapax\u201d, i.e., an isolated case. The best\nway to understand the meaning of this phrase is given by Plutarch when\nhe says that Alexander, seeking the proper place for the Egyptian city\ndestined to bear his name, had a vision (Life of Alexander\n26). In it, Homer recites two verses for him in which he mentioned the\nisland of Paros (Odyssey 4.354\u201355). Alexander declares\nto his friends that he will follow Homer\u2019s advice since he was\nthe wisest architect\u2014an already well-known story in Alexandria\nto which Philo alludes in his own way. The difference between\nPhilo\u2019s reference to Alexander and Plutarch\u2019s is itself\ninteresting. In the latter case, Homer is not only the greatest poet\nbut also the father of all science. In the former, it is not the poet\nbut the exegete that unveils the meanings of dreams. And dreams sent\nby God always reveal something about the truth of the world.\n4.2 Negative theology and Providence\n\nPhilo is also considered the founder of negative theology in the\nhistory of monotheistic faith. Given the association of his faith with\ncontemporary forms of Skepticism, he was also the founder of at least\na kind of fideism, i.e., a doctrine in which faith is the foundation\nof all essential truths. His apparent versatility in exegesis can give\nthe impression that his only purpose is to make philosophical themes\nand words coincide with the text of Bible. However, though Philo is\nnot as systematic as Plotinus, there is much more coherence in his\nphysics and metaphysics than one might think. Even John Dillon, hardly\nan unconditional admirer of Philo, argues that \u201che follows a\nsystem in which the supreme principle is the One\u201d, meaning not\nthe God of philosophers but the personal God of Judaism (1977: 155).\nThe problem of possible philosophical antecedents to Philo\u2019s\nconception of an unknowable and ineffable God is a complex one. Such a\nhypothesis cannot be dismissed, but there is no clear evidence of its\ntruth. In any case, negativity is, par excellence, the manner\nof speaking in the best way possible about God. It is not the only\none; there is also the possibility of declaring His perfection and\ninfinite glory. And metaphors, like those of monarchy, the sower, and\nthe sun, are still different. But the uiae negationis,\neminentiae (all that is good has its origin in God), and\nanalogiae (there is a kind of analogy of being between\nCreator and creature), though perfectly compatible with each other,\nare only poor human means to suggest Him who can\u2019t be seen,\nnamed, nor known. Nevertheless, one of the most interesting\ncomparative means to evoke man\u2019s relation to God is the\nvocabulary of mysteries, for example when Philo says in Cher.\n49: \n\n\nI myself was initiated under Moses the God-beloved into his great\nmysteries, yet when I saw the prophet Jeremiah and knew him to be not\nonly himself enlightened, but a worthy minister of the holy secrets, I\nwas not slow to become his disciple. \n\n\nThe comparison with the Eleusinian mysteries is so precise that Moses\nis often called \u201chierophantos\u201d, initiated in the\nSinai to mysteries most obscure. As it had held in Eleusis, Philo\nspeaks of \u201clittle mysteries\u201d and \u201cgreat\nmysteries\u201d, the former leading to liberation from passions, the\nlatter from sensations. Many other elements, especially those of the\nsacred banquet, resonate with the theme of the mysteries. Many\nscholars suggested that Philo situated himself in the Platonic\ntradition of philosophically transposing the Eleusinian mysteries. In\nthis perspective, the mystery is the allegoric method itself.\nHowever, one could object to this interpretation that the meaning of a\nmetaphor is not monolithic. It depends in great part on the identity\nof the addressee, about which we know little. Indeed, there was at\nleast one ambiguity: did Philo want to prove to hypothetic Greek\nreaders that Eleusinian mysteries were shadowy images of the only true\nmysteries, the Jewish ones? Was he using a kind of spiritual\nlingua franca elaborated during the pluralistic honeymoon at\nthe beginning of the Ptolemaic period? Still, no element of the\nmysteries\u2019 lexicon could trace a shift with regard to the theme\nof the impossibility of knowing God.\n\nEven the man who was the closest to God, Moses, could not see Him in\nthe Sinai. God is \u201cineffable, inconceivable and\nincomprehensible\u201d (Mut. 15). This means that without\nRevelation, it would be impossible to say anything about Him that bore\nrelation with truth. At the same time, the absolute transcendence of\nGod, as theorized by Philo, could have implied His perfect\nindifference to the world of matter, time, and sensibility. Yet,\nthrough His providence, God is present in the world He created. From a\nphilosophical point of view, the problem of what Radice calls\n\u201cthe antinomy of transcendence and providence\u201d played a\ngreat role even in the period before Middle Platonism (2009: 128). The\nreturn to Platonic transcendence was the major philosophical\ncharacteristic of Philo\u2019s age. It is highly improbable, however,\nthat philosophy had a determining role in shaping his faith and\nbeliefs. More probable is that he perceived himself in the tradition\nof biblical translators, the Septuagint being so highly praised by him\nin the Vita Mosis. In a time when Egypt was Ptolemaic, these\ntranslations had both political and cultural purposes. In\nPhilo\u2019s time, the main center of Greek power was cultural. To\ncomment upon the Bible with philosophical concepts was, in a certain\nway, to translate it into the language of the new cultural elite, the\nRoman as well as Greek. Regardless, the central idea was that the word\nof God had to be mediated to become accessible outside of Israel. From\nthis point of view, mediation was a central Philonian concept, not\nonly linguistically and culturally, but also ontologically: in\nSomn. 1.62, he says that God fulfilled His Word with His\nincorporeal powers.\n4.3 Powers of God and logos\n\nOne of the main Philonian concepts, power, is all the more complex\ngiven the varieties in Philo\u2019s prose when discussing it (Termini\n2000). These variations were probably a means to avoid the implication\nthat these powers had an ontological autonomy. Their nature, rather,\nis merely linguistic and functionalist. The number of God\u2019s\npower is not fixed and their relation to the logos is evoked\nvaguely or not at all. From a philosophical point of view, the\ngenealogy of dunamis is incredibly rich since each great\nGreek philosopher used it with his own semantic specificity. In the\nBible, God is omnipotent but there is no systematic presentation of\nHis powers. Just before the apparition of Middle Platonism,\ndunamis was present in Stoic doctrine, but with a more\nreduced range of meaning. The question of Philo\u2019s source(s) on\nthis point is very controversial, but the general structure is quite\nclear. His two main powers are the \u201ccreative power\u201d\n(theos) and \u201cregal power\u201d (kyrios)\n(Cher. 27\u20138). The beneficent and the legislative powers\nare subordinated to them, but in Spec. 1.45, Philo uses a\nPlatonic metaphor to assert that God is surrounded by a great number\nof powers who are like His bodyguards. Before trying to specify the\nrelation between these powers and the logos, it is necessary\nto add that dunamis is not only a metaphysical term. It bears\na psychological meaning as well, for example at Opif. 67 when\nPhilo evokes the division of the soul in a context both Aristotelian\nand Stoic. In Leg. 1.11, the division is more clearly Stoic,\nwith its seven traditional parts (the five senses, reproduction and\nspeech) but at the same time, Philo seems to adopt a dualistic\nposition, distinguishing a rational and irrational part of the soul.\nThe main problem, in human psychology as with the divine powers, lies\nin their relation to the logos.\n\nIt seems that Philo did his utmost to make the relation between God\nand the logos as complex as possible (Calabi 2008). As an\nexample of these difficulties, in Leg. 2.86, God is said to\nbe the supreme genus and His logos the second one.\nOther things, Philo adds, only exist in speech and sometimes amount to\nmere nothingness. In the third book of the same treatise\n(Leg. 3.175\u20136), the logos is defined as the\n\u201cti\u201d, i.e., the all-encompassing genus in the\nStoic system. To explain this definition, Philo specifies that\nGod\u2019s logos is the supreme genus of everything that was\nborn. From a philosophical point of view, if somebody remains in the\nworld of immanence, he can refer to the universal logos, and\nonly to him. But to see the logos as the ultimate expression\nof the absolute is for Philo an absolute impiety. In fact, the\nlogos is only God\u2019s shadow, His image, the instrument\nby which He created the world, or in a more anthropomorphic way, His\n\u201cfirst-born son\u201d or His deputy (Agr. 51). In\nFug. 109, the logos is said to be \u201cthe Son of\nGod and Sophia\u201d. The Pythagorean-Platonic model of Creation\nacting on undefined matter is thus both preserved and richly\ntransformed.\n\nGod is unity, and only unity. It is the logos which carries\nin itself the principle of contraries, mixing good and evil. This\nleads in turn to a distinction between ontology and methodology.\nAnyone who divinizes the world, seeing it as the most perfect\nexpression of the logos, is deeply wrong, since he omits God,\nthe truly supreme genus and the only one not to have been created. At\nthe same time, the exegete of God\u2019s word can occasionally lead\nto his commentary focusing on the logos, creating a false\nresemblance to Stoicism. However, the theologian is, mutatis\nmutandis, like the biologist who today chooses some cells to\nplace under his microscope. This act, of course, does not imply that\nthe biologist forgets the tissue of which these cells are a part.\nSimilarly, Philo\u2019s focus on logos should never suggest\nthat he feels a temptation toward Stoicism. Themes and language of\nimmanence are for him only a means to better understand the world\ncreated by God. When he praises the philosophers who recommend\n\u201cliving according to nature\u201d, he uses a famous Stoic\nformula, but immediately after explains that this means \u201cto\nfollow God\u201d (Migr. 128). For a Stoic, the two formulae\nwere strictly synonymous. In Philo\u2019s thought, the former is\nvalid only if it is followed by a reference to God, who is\ntranscendent by definition.\n\nThe intermediary status of the logos and the many nuances in\nthe expression of its nature do not prevent Philo from providing a\nmore or less systematic framework.\n\nThe logos, God\u2019s organon in the creation of\nthe world, is described in Opif. 20 as \u201cthe place of\nthe Ideas\u201d, a metaphoric expression since for Philo the\nintelligible world could not be contained in a place. While the\ndemiurge contemplates the Ideas in order to create the World in the\nTimaeus, in the De opificio, God not only creates\nthe Ideas but organizes them into an intelligible world. In\nHer. 119, the divine logos is said to be both sower\nand creator. The former word refers to a Stoic concept, that of\nspermatikoi logoi, defined as the rational patterns inherent\nin the principles of organization of the world, but which Philo\npreferred not to use with precision. The Quis heres is\nprobably the treatise in which Philo\u2019s reflection on the\nlogos\u2019 way of action is most complete, through the\nconcept of logos divider (tomeus). In Stoicism, one\nof the main functions of the logos is to establish the\nprinciple of the idi\u00f4s poion, that is to say, the\nabsolute specificity of each being in the world. In the Quis\nheres, perhaps under the influence of a Stoicized interpretation\nof the Timaeus, Philo explains how God created the four\nelements from undifferentiated matter, then individual beings, by\nmixing these elements together.\n\nAs was said rightly by Radice, the \n\n\nphilosophical doctrine of the powers\u2026 allowed Philo to maintain\nboth the oneness of God despite His many names and epithets, and the\ntranscendence of God despite His action on the world. (2009: 136)\n\n4.4 The Law of Nature\n\nThe relation between the logos and the law of Nature is an\ninteresting topic since it shows the different perspectives of\nPhilo\u2019s thought and Stoic doctrine despite their many\nsimilarities (Najman 1999). For the Stoics, the logos and the\nlaw of Nature are perfectly synonymous. In their definition, the law\nof Nature is the command of the logos as to what must be done\nand what avoided. Philo\u2019s thought of the law is different. In\nOpif. 143, Philo alludes to man\u2019s original ancestor as\nliving in a world governed by a constitution, i.e., \u201cthe right\nreason of nature\u201d, which is named with more appropriate title\n\u201cordinance\u201d, a divine law according to which obligations\nand rights have been distributed to each creature. The vocabulary is\nStoic, but with an interesting nuance: Philo speaks about \u201cthe\nright reason of nature\u201d instead of \u201cthe law of\nnature\u201d. This is perhaps more than a stylistic variation;\ninstead, it may have served to reveal a distance with regard to the\ncanonical doctrine of the law of Nature. This distance appears to be\nessential, despite many variations and occasional contradictions.\nFirst of all, while Stoic natural law is affirmed by Cicero to be\n\u201cthe same in Athens and in Rome\u201d, but without any precise\nformulation, the Torah, specific law of the people of Israel, is\nposited by Philo to be unique, since it is both concrete and eternal.\nThe law of Moses thus has an ambiguous status, since it is sometimes\nsaid to be the Natural Law itself, and sometimes an image,\neik\u00f4n, of it. It is a controversial point whether the\nterm \u201cimage\u201d means an ontological degradation or a perfect\nidentity of one with the other. Last but not least, Philo emphasizes\nthe fact that before the Torah, the patriarchs were unwritten\nincarnations of the law of Nature. Admittedly, his task bordered on\nthe impossible. He had to take into account both the historicity of\nthe Torah and its eternity, its universality, and its institutional\nstatus as law of Israel. It is not impossible that he had in mind a\nmodel similar to the translation of the Torah into Greek. In the\nVita Mosis, he emphasizes the fact that the Greek translation\nand the Hebrew (he says \u201cChaldean\u201d) original are perfectly\nidentical and equivalent. There is a plasticity of the law of Nature,\nat first incarnated by the patriarchs, then written; and a plasticity\nof the Torah, first in Hebrew, then in Greek. At the same time, their\nunderlying function is always the same: defining a principle of\nethical responsibility not exclusively from the rationality of the\nworld but by reference to a personal God who chose Israel to incarnate\nand bear witness to this principle in its different forms.\n4.5 Creation and anthropology\n\nThe De opificio was often defined as a Jewish version of the\nTimaeus (Sterling 1993). In this treatise, Philo proclaims,\nagainst Aristotelianism and Stoicism, that God is the unique Creator\nboth of the models for the world and of the world itself. That does\nnot prevent him from drawing upon patterns elaborated in the somewhat\nconfused but rich period at the end of the first century BCE. The\nevaluation of the most common model of cosmological creation in the\nDe opificio, that of an active power acting on unqualified\nmatter, is difficult since Philo seems to affirm that God created the\nworld ex nihilo in some passages. It is probable that there\nwas no significant difference between unqualified matter and pure void\nfor him. God\u2019s first task\u2014though Philo refuses to admit\nthe historicity of Creation (Runia 2001: 156\u2013162)\u2014was\nacting as architect to elaborate His project, i.e., to structure the\nintelligible world, conceived as the model of the corporeal one and\nestablished in the logos. The chief contents of the\nincorporeal cosmos were heaven, an invisible earth, air and void,\nwater, spirit, and light. After the creation of the firmament and of\nthe earth, on the fourth day God proceeded to order the heaven and to\nadorn it with splendid heavenly bodies. The explanation of this fourth\nday is especially interesting given the following elements:\n\n\n\nGod has absolute liberty, and creates the less-important earth before\nthe more-important celestial bodies.\n\n\nHe knows what the then non-existent human beings will think and wants\nto prevent them from thinking that the movement of the celestial\nbodies is the cause of everything. This could be called the Chaldean\ntemptation, not without similarities to Stoicism, and is an obsessive\nfear of Philo\u2019s.\n\n\nAt this point he begins an extensive section on Pythagorean\narithmology, including a meditation on the perfection of the number\nfour.\n\n\nOn the fifth day, God creates the living beings according to a\nscala naturae replete with Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic\nechoes. As has been remarked, there is a crucial difference between\nPlato and Philo on this point (Runia 2001: 213). While \u201cthe\ncreational sequence\u201d is descending in the former, in the\nAlexandrian exegetes\u2014who aim to defend the Biblical\naccount\u2014it ascends. Between the fishes, which are the first\ncreated, and man, crown of Creation, are birds and land animals. The\ncreation of man, on the sixth day, is for Philo an occasion to develop\nsome of his main themes: the resemblance of the human being to God,\nbased on the Platonic and Stoic idea that the intellect holds the same\nposition in the human being that the Great Creator holds in the\ncosmos; the concept of the powers of God, introduced with his exegesis\nof the words, \u201clet us make a human being after our image and\nlikeness\u201d. In fact, argues Philo, God needed no one to create\nthe human being, but preferred that human sins not be attributed to\nHim. In addition, he cites the Platonic idea of contemplation leading\nto philosophy, a risky idea since it could lead to such a fascination\nwith worldly things that the Creator would be forgotten and denied, as\nwas the case with the Chaldeans. After a long arithmologic meditation\non the hebdomad, the seventh day or Shabbat, Philo arrives at original\nsin. It is said that the first man (the name Adam is never evoked) was\nmost excellent in his body as well as his soul. He lived in perfect\nharmony with nature, homeless, but the cosmos was his home and city,\nwhere he resided with complete safety. God ascribed to the first man\nthe imposition of names, a philosophical theme with strong Platonic\nconnotations. In the following paragraphs Philo explains his descent\ninto wickedness by the creation of woman. The sentence \u201cwoman\nbecomes for him the starting point of a blameworthy life\u201d has\naroused many criticisms of misogyny on Philo\u2019s part. It would be\nabsurd to deny that there are many offensive assertions regarding\nwomen in his work. Woman is the symbol of sensation, man that of\nreason. These problems are essential in that they deal with sexuality,\nethics and ontology alike. Without trying to defend Philo\nsystematically, one must however emphasize the first sentence of\nOpif. 151: \n\n\nBut since nothing is stable in the world of becoming, mortal beings\nnecessarily undergo reverses and changes, the first human being too\nhad to enjoy some ill fortune. \n\n\nThe word \u201cnecessarily\u201d means that human responsibility is\nmuch more relative than absolute. The first man could not eternally\nhave a perfect life in a world which was not the intelligible one. In\nStoic doctrine, the similarity between the sage and God is a permanent\none. Philo is much more cautious when saying at Opif. 151:\n\n\n\nAs long as he was single, he resembled God and the cosmos in his\nsolitariness, receiving the delineations of his soul, not all of them\nbut as many as a mortal constitution could contain. \n\n\nEve\u2019s role was inscribed in Adam\u2019s ontological\ninstability. In Philo\u2019s allegorical interpretation, defined not\nas a certainty but a conjecture, the serpent is the symbol of\npleasure. It cannot be said, however, that pleasure is an absolute\nevil in Philo\u2019s thought. It is necessary in the created world\nand it is said in Leg. 2.17 that the new born child makes use\nof it. The defenders of pleasure are not absolutely wrong when they\nsay that offspring feel an affinity with it. Their error is not in\ndefending pleasure but in transforming its auxiliary role into the\nalpha and omega of ethics. The moment of humankind\u2019s fall is\nneither the triumph of evil, nor a victory of individual perversity,\nbut rather the appearance of a contrast between the first man in his\ninitial perfection and a world which, being created on the basis of\nthe intelligible one, could not itself be perfect.\n4.6 Soul and body\n\nIn a huge catalogue of philosophical opinions, which is of\nconsiderable interest, Philo begins by demonstrating how little we\nknow about heaven, then arrives at the human being about whom he says\nthat he/she has four parts: body, sensibility, speech, intellect\n(nous) (Somn. 1.25). He exposes all that we know\nabout the first three, for example, that body has three dimensions and\nsix ways of moving. But about the intellect, he says that it is\nabsolutely unintelligible. Nothing is known about its nature, its way\nof arriving in the body, or its place. As with the place of heaven in\nthe world, we are unable to say anything about it. But in contrast\nwith this scientific and philosophical ignorance, the Bible gives its\nreader true information. The intellect is a divine emanation\n(Somn. 1.34, Genesis 2:7), and the human being is the one who\nreceived the privilege of worshipping God, the One Being. There are\ngrounding elements of the problem: what must the human being do in the\nface of such problems? Philo\u2019s answer is both philosophical and\ntheological. She must, like Socrates or like Terah (father of Abraham)\nin the Torah, make a constant effort to have better self-knowledge.\nSocrates is the man who had no other philosophy than to know himself,\nwhile Terah is the very idea of knowing oneself. What does it mean to\nknow oneself? Essentially, to have a clearer idea of one\u2019s\nposition with respect to God and His powers in order to have the means\nof becoming wiser, and therefore better. The human being has no other\npersonal good than reason. The paradoxical aim of reason is to\nperceive the distance between God and His creation (Somn.\n1.66) and so to understand how far He is from human comprehension.\n\nTo know oneself does not mean to have a perfect science of what a soul\nis. Philo knows all the suppositions elaborated by philosophers and he\nuses many of them, but without ever saying that he is in possession of\nknowledge of the soul. It has been rightly said that his purpose was\nnot to build a scientific but a \u201creligious psychology\u201d. In\nthis kind of psychology, it was not essential to know if a soul has\nseven components besides reason, as it is said by the Stoics, or\nthree, like in the Platonic division, or if it contains, besides\nreason, nutritive and sensitive parts like in Aristotelianism. Here\nI\u2019ll give a few examples of his varieties of uses. In\nOpif. 117, soul is compared to a puppet show, the seven\npuppets being manipulated by the h\u00e8gemonikon, the\ncentral rational element. This metaphor strongly reminds us of the\nStoic comparison with the octopus, but is also very different from\nthis image. The octopus is a living unity, while the puppet master is\nessentially different from his puppets. The Stoic metaphor of the\noctopus is a monist one, but the Philonian image, inspired from Plato\n(Laws 644d), is strongly dualistic. The puppets are not even\nirrational beings as they are mere objects. But it is true that in\nLeg. 1.28, the image of the source and the stream could have\nbeen used by the most orthodox of the Stoics if separated from its\ncontext. In 1.29, Philo says that the intellect (nous, note\nthat he does not use the Stoic word logos) is like a source\ngoing to the senses. There is, however, no contradiction in all this.\nIn 1.30, Philo uses a strictly Stoic definition: the living being is\ncharacterized by representation and impulse. But when he arrives to\nthe human being at 1.31, Stoicism is completed by a Biblical quotation\n(Genesis 2:7). A Stoic image is a good way to speak about living\nbeings, but it is not enough when the narrative is about humans. That\nis why Philo often uses the distinction between rational and\nirrational beings with an opposition between the\nh\u00e8gemonikon, unique and rational, and the other parts\nof soul, divided in seven and irrational. However, it must be added\nthat in Philo, dualistic images do not imply the division of the soul.\nIn Leg. 2.8, he asserts that sensation and passions are like\nparts and products of a unified soul. Such are the multi-layered\nlevels of language Philo is capable of using at every page. For him,\nit is impossible to know what a human soul is, but it is not necessary\nto have this kind of knowledge in order to try to understand what the\nmeaning of the word of the Lord is. To be conscious of her ignorance\nin the field of psychology, far from being an obstacle, actually helps\nto have a better perception of the limitations inherent to human\nnature. But this consciousness itself necessarily rises from the\nconfrontation of the philosophical doctrines.\n\nIt would be an error to affirm that Philo despises and hates the body.\nEven if he is often very harsh towards it, he never forgets that when\nGod created the first human being, He made him not only spiritually\nperfect, but also physically beautiful. He does not see any\ninconvenience in emphasizing the perfection of sensation or sexuality.\nIt is said in Opif. 136 that the first human being was truly\nand really kalos kagathos, beautiful and good. It is strange\nto find in a Jewish biblical commentator the explicit expression of\nthis Greek ideal of humanity. At the same time, it could mean that for\nPhilo the Greek conception of this expression was an erroneous one,\nsince it did not imply an immediate link with divine transcendence.\nGod, Philo says, was a good technit\u00e8s, both of the\nbody and the soul. The beauty of the body is in Opif. 138\nexplained in specific Greek terms, symmetry, beauty of the flesh, and\ncolor. All these concepts can be found in Plato, Aristotle, and the\nStoics, but it does not mean that Philo uses them in the same way. In\nPhilo, the body is not a principle of evil, though it can be used as\nan instrument of perversion when the human being focuses more on\nhimself than on the powers of God. We find in Leg. 3.71,\nhowever, the assertion that the body is bad by nature,\npon\u00e8ron fusei. The meaning of the expression is\nperfectly clear, but it is also necessary to remember the context.\nPhilo is commenting on Genesis 38:7, where it is said that God killed\nEr without any justified reason. According to Philo, \u201cER\u201d\nmeans in Hebrew the flesh, the body which is a threat for the soul.\nBut at the same time Philo specifies that to create the best things,\nGod had to create less good things. This can lead to the conclusion\nthat the pon\u00e8ron fusei means not absolute but relative\nperversion since the body is necessary to demonstrate, by contrast,\nthe beauty of soul. Creation is good by nature (fusei) and\nthe body is an element of the Creation. The example of Issachar in\nLeg. 1.83 shows how necessary the body is for ethical\nprogress. But at the same time, the knowledge of the body can be only\nphenomenological, while real research is ontological. This can explain\nPhilo\u2019s violent attacks on the body: it is a tomb (following the\nPlatonic play on words comparing the body to a tomb), a\nnos\u00e8ma (disease), a vase unable to contain its desire,\nand most frequently a burden of flesh. But all this verbal violence is\naddressed more to human error on the value of the body than to the\nbody itself created by God.\n5. Transcendental Ethics\n5.1 From oikei\u00f4sis to omoi\u00f4sis\n\nOne major intellectual revolution in the passage from the Hellenistic\nperiod to Middle Platonism was a relative abandoning of the concept of\noikei\u00f4sis (natural kinship) which, originating with the\nStoics, became a foundation of ethics not only in Stoicism but also in\nEpicureanism and the late Aristotelianism of Antiochus of Ascalon. The\nHellenistic period was that of a naturalism that only the sceptic\nAcademy undertook to fight it. The great change brought by Middle\nPlatonism was the irruption of transcendence which seemed to have been\nforgotten for at least two centuries. And in the case of Philo,\ntranscendence was not only philosophical, but also religious, mainly\nthat of the God of the Bible. Philo sometimes uses the term\noikei\u00f4sis, but never in the Stoic meaning, always with\nsemantic transformations. He could not accept the idea, central in the\ndogma of oikei\u00f4sis, that children as well as animals\nare the image of nature. His own description of the world of childhood\nis a frightening one, a description Sigmund Freud would not have\nspurned. For him the main ethical purpose is to become closer and\ncloser to God, and so to be in a spiritual kinship with Him. At this\npoint, Philonian oikei\u00f4sis is not different from the\nPlatonic omoi\u00f4sis. It is not, as in Stoicism, an\ninitial impulse, indicating the path of nature, but the result of a\npious asceticism, getting rid of desire and passionate impulses. It\nhas been suggested that the resemblance to God did not have in Philo\nany concrete social or ethical consequences, but things are much more\ncomplex. He says in Decalogo 133 that murder is forbidden\nbecause of the common resemblance (omoi\u00f4sis) of all men\nto God, but it is true that he does not develop extensively the\nconsequences of this omoi\u00f4sis. In Stoicism, there is a\nkind of family relationship between human beings, since they alone\n(among animals) share reason in a world which is itself exclusively\nrational. Philo puts great weight on the specific status of Israel as\nthe only people able to see God, an etymology of which he is very\nfond. In Alexandria, anti-Semitic propagandists accused Jews of being\na group unified through their hatred of other nations, and today in\nthe scholarship, the problem of universalism in Philo is much\ndiscussed (Berthelot 2003). However, it is necessary to distinguish\nbetween the ontological level and the ethical level. Because of its\nspecific relation with God, Israel is the priest of the Nations, for\nwhom it prays and offers sacrifices (Abr. 98; Somn.\n2.163; Mos. 2.133\u2013135). At the same time, Philo never\ndenied that non-Jews could reach wisdom. For him, as well as Jews,\nGreeks and Barbarians could be ascetics of wisdom. Jewish superiority\nlies in the unique capacity to articulate the three levels: human\nindividual perfection, with the examples of the patriarchs and Moses;\nsocial perfection, that of a society ruled by the laws of Moses; and\nontological specificity, due to a deep kinship with God.\n5.2 From passions to virtue\n\nPhilo\u2019s general vision of mankind is often pessimistic. In\nIos. 30, he uses the Stoic metaphor of the world as a huge\ncity, but a city ruled by violence and hatred. The main cause of this\ndisaster is the reign of passion, a theme very often evoked in the\nphilosophy of his time. In his exegesis of the Biblical passages\nrelating to human errors, Philo uses many philosophical terms and\nmetaphors. Sometimes, he uses a Platonizing description of passion,\nrecalling the description of the winged team of horses in\nPhaedrus 253 c\u2013e. At the same time, in many texts, he\nrefers to the Stoic division of passions, with four bad passions\n(path\u00ea): desire, fear, sadness, and pleasure, and three\ngood passions, joy, caution, and will. But his use of this Stoic\ndivision is not strictly faithful to the original. In his allegorical\ninterpretation of Det. 119\u2013120, Philo contrasts bad and\ngood passions, but he introduces hope and repentance, biblical\nvirtues, among the latter. It was not simply a terminological change,\nbut the sign of a deep ontological change. In Stoic doctrine, only the\npresent exists. To be a sage means to understand that the past and the\nfuture have no real existence, but are mainly spaces of projection for\npassions. By introducing hope and repentance among good passions,\nPhilo, without renouncing a complete, or at least as complete as\npossible, control of bad passions, opened a path going from psychology\nto transcendentalist ethics. \n\nPhilo, without giving a precise and irreversible definition of the\nnature of soul, recommends the radical excision of passions in\nLeg. 3.129, arguing that no moderation of them could be\nsatisfactory. The model is a medical one of major surgery, which will\nalso be used by Seneca. In the fight against passions,\nenkrateia (self-control) and karteria (endurance)\nplay a decisive role. However, only the sage can live without any\npassion in Stoicism, and everyone knows that the Stoic sage is\nextremely rare in the history of mankind. It was impossible for Philo\nto admit that a human being could be perfect. However, it is said in\nDeus 67 that Moses aimed at the disappearance of the\npassions, but did he succeed in it? There are many similarities\nbetween Philo\u2019s attitude towards passions and that of the\nStoics, but there is also a fundamental difference. For him it is\nimpossible to become free from passion without divine Grace. That does\nnot mean that one has to become passive and wait for God\u2019s\nintervention. Enkrateia and karteria are individual\nqualities that are encouraged by the rules of life included in the\nlaws of Moses. However, even before the Law was given to Moses, faith\nwas the condition sine qua non to escape the process of\npassion. When Abraham received the order to sacrifice his son, he\nobeyed without any emotion. \u201cHe admitted no swerving of body nor\nmind\u201d (Abr. 175). His faith was so absolute that at no\nmoment did he try to revolt. But there is yet another difference with\nStoicism. In this doctrine, the sage cannot lose his perfection, and\nhe remains always in his apatheia (perfect serenity) even if\nhe has reflex reactions (propatheiai) of which his judgment\nis not responsible. On the contrary, at the death of Sarah, Abraham\navoids the two attitudes considered erroneous by Philo. He did not\ngrieve over-bitterly nor did he assume indifference\n(apatheia) as if nothing painful had occurred. On this\noccasion, the patriarch chose the metriopatheia, the middle\nway, which, in philosophy, corresponds to Aristotelian doctrine.\nUnlike the Stoics, Philo does not try to present apatheia as\na kind of ethical heroism. Unlike the Peripatetics, he does not think\nthat ethics always requires reasonable aims. He considers the human\nbeing able to transform bad passions into good ones and affirms that\nthere are no natural limits to his perfectibility when he accepts to\nsubmit himself to the power of God.\n5.3 Virtues, the paths to perfection\n\nMost philosophical themes related to virtue are present in the\nPhilonian treatises. The four traditional virtues (phronesis\n[prudence], s\u00f4phrosyn\u00e8 [temperance],\nandreia [courage], dikaiosun\u00e8 [justice]) are\ncompleted through enkrateia which pertains more specifically\nto the Cynic-Stoic tradition as the science of that which appears in\nline with right reason. In Spec. 4.135, we find a different\ndefinition of the four cardinal virtues: eusebeia (piety,\nsanctity) is defined as \u201cthe queen of virtues\u201d, and\nwisdom, temperance, and justice following. In the treatise De\nvirtutibus, metanoia (repentance) and eugeneia\n(nobility) have special importance (Wilson 2010). The first concept,\nconsidered an unhappy passion by the Stoics, is the equivalent of the\nJewish concept of teshuva. In Philo, it expresses the strong\nconnection between theological and moral reflection. Eugeneia\nhas nothing of a racist concept, since all those who are temperate and\njust are truly noble (Virt. 189). Abraham, son of a Chaldean\nastrologist, becomes the symbol of true nobility when he emigrated\nfrom polytheism to monotheism.\n\nOne of the most interesting elements in the Philonian presentation of\nvirtues is the understanding of matriarchs as allegorical symbols of\nvirtues. Gender differences are a complex and interesting aspect of\nthe Alexandrine\u2019s thought. One cannot deny his misogyny, which,\nhowever, is not common since it is expressed through rather\nsophisticated semantic webs. Virtue is, on his view, masculine in its\nessence, since it is powerful and active. The realm of reason is\nmasculine, \u201cfor nature is the law of men, and to follow nature\nis the mark of a strong and truly masculine reason\u201d\n(Ebr. 54\u20135). Why, then, are women, the matriarchs,\nchosen as symbols of virtues? The answer given in Fug. 51 is\nthat God used a feminine appearance so that even the most perfect\nhuman qualities would be imperfect. Each matriarch has her allegorical\npeculiarities. Sarah, for example, is said to have nothing to do with\nthe world of women and to be born, like Athena, from the father of\neverything (Ebr. 60\u20131). At the same time, she unites\nwith Abraham to give birth to Isaac, who is the allegory of joy, one\nof the three Stoic good passions (eupatheiai) which also\ninclude will (boul\u00e8sis) and caution\n(eulabeia).\n\nIn Stoicism, virtue, or human perfection, is the natural end\n(telos) of the programming of mankind by Providence. In\nPhilo, things are more complex because of Original Sin. For the\nStoics, there was no ontologisation of evil in a world which was\nentirely rational, and to become as perfect as God was not an absurd\nproject. Philo lived in a period when most philosophers chose a more\nmodest purpose: to become like God as far as possible by flying from\nthe earthly sphere to the heavenly realm (Plato, Theaetetus\n176 a\u2013b). To live in the least imperfect way was the goal, a\ngoal which had some similarities with the Stoic figure of the\nprokopt\u00f4n, the person making moral progress. Philo knew\nthe different aspects of this figure and gave his own interpretation\nof it in Agr. 15. The striving towards a lesser imperfection\ncould take three forms, a division with Platonic/Pythagorean origin\nbut embodied by the example of the patriarchs. Abraham embodies the\neffort to know, in traveling from astrology to real comprehension of\nnature, then from the comprehension of nature to \u201cthe maker and\nfather of the world\u201d; Isaac symbolizes the happy nature,\n\u201cthe new race, superior to reason and truly divine\u201d\n(Fug. 168); and Jacob, the struggle against senses and\npassions. Philo stresses the fact that each of these three types is\npresent in the other two (Abr. 52\u201353). From a formal\npoint of view, the relation among the three types is not fundamentally\ndifferent from that of the virtues in the Stoic system which aims to\nreconcile the unity of the whole and the specificity of each\nelement.On the specificities of the character of Joseph in\nHellenistic philosophy, see Niehoff (1992)\n\n\nThere is an element which differentiates Philo from his contemporary\nphilosophers and rabbis: the absence of a master. It is impossible to\nfind in his vast corpus the name of someone who initiated him to\nphilosophy or to Biblical exegesis. Why this silence about his\nmasters? One possible explanation is that for Philo, transmission is\ngreater than the transmitters. He is consistent regarding this\nposition when he speaks very little of himself. His main idea is that\n\u201cthe only good that is infallible and firm is faith in\nGod\u201d (Abr. 268). The human being can improve herself,\nand she can have a clear conscience (suneid\u00easis is a\nkey word of Philo\u2019s ethical vocabulary) of the ethical issues,\nbut this does not allow her to assert her real existence.\n5.4 Politics and contemplation\n\nAlmost all the details that we know of Philo\u2019s life are in\nrelation to his political activity. Though he himself has a clear\npreference for theoretical and mystical life, he played an important\nrole in the Jewish community of Alexandria. This is one of the great\nparadoxes of his life. He thought that it was necessary to engage in\npolitical affairs before attempting the contemplative life, but the\ntragic situation of the Alexandrine community obliged him to commit to\npublic life in order to defend his coreligionists. Nevertheless, he\nnever considered politics a field without interest. His treatises are\nfull of remarks about the origin of society, or about the functioning\nof human society. Stasis, violent sedition in the city, was\none of his main concerns, certainly based on his own experience. He\nwas perfectly aware of the Stoic doctrine of the social\noikei\u00f4sis, which affirmed that the whole of mankind was\na natural community, arranged in concentric circles (family, nation,\nhumankind as a whole). He did not deny the existence of kinship among\nhuman beings, even if \u201cmalignant covetousness\u201d is always a\nsource of hatred. He tried to give a concrete shape to the natural\nlink by encouraging philanthropy and demanding humane treatment of\nslaves. He did not hesitate in advocating their emancipation. He even\nasserts that their emancipation \u201cgranted freedom to him who is\nnaturally free\u201d (Spec. 2.84). At the same time, he\ndescribes mankind as being deeply divided by passions, wars, and all\nkinds of violence. He has the same optimistic vision of human nature,\nat least in principle, as the Stoics, while he also adopted the\npessimistic view of the Neo-Academic Carneades in his critique of\nStoicism. One of his most original ideas to transcend this duality was\nthat individual political regimes were \u201cadditions to the one\nnatural regime\u201d (Ios. 28\u201331). The dispersion of\nhumanity and the strength of the passions have as consequence that\nharmonious coexistence of nations, though theoretically possible, is\nin reality impossible. Because there is, in politics, a permanent\nantagonism between individual passions and natural reason, the figure\nof the politician is himself varied and contradictory. Moses is not a\npolitician, but at once the figure of the philosopher-king, the sage,\nthe priest, and the prophet. Even before receiving the Law, he is the\nincarnation of the law (nomos empsychos), as were the\npatriarchs (Abr. 3\u20135). Joseph, the best politician, is\nnot a constant object of Philo\u2019s admiration. Even though a\nrecent paper (Frazier 2002) tried to give evidence of a greater\ncoherence between the two treatises, in the De Iosepho Joseph\nis described as a responsible and courageous man, while in the De\nsomniis he is said to be mainly desperate for glory. For Philo,\nmonotheism would imply the superiority of monarchy, but with the\nexception of Moses, most human beings are too weak and inconsistent to\nensure stable monarchy. In fact, his political thought is profoundly\ninfluenced by the Hellenistic idea of anacycl\u00f4sis, the\nnatural instability of the three elementary constitutions (monarchy,\naristocracy, and democracy). The Greek historian Polybius had thought\nthat a mixed constitution would be the guarantee against this\ninstability, and he saw in the Roman constitution the paradigm of this\nstability. In a certain sense, for Philo, the city of Moses is the\nmodel of a new kind of constitution: it associates transcendence with\nlaw of nature, particularism and universalism, monarchy, aristocracy\nand democracy. Was it for him, as it said by Carlier (2008: 433)\n\u201cun mod\u00e8le concurrentiel \u00e0 la civitas\nromana\u201d (i.e., a competitive model to Rome)? Certainly it\nwas for him a model of a different kind, a radically different kind of\nexemplarity. In this perspective, the famous and controversial passage\nabout the Essenians (Probus 75\u201392) can be read as the\ndemonstration that this model was not a utopian one.\n\nFor Cicero, who has many common points with Philo despite fundamental\ndifferences, the problem of the choice of life (theoretical,\npolitical, or mixed) is one of the most frequent themes of his\nphilosophical reflection. For him, it was essentially a matter of\npersonal choice. In the case of Philo, as it was underlined by Calabi\n(2011, 2013: 87), the commandment to observe the Sabbath establishes a\nstructural organization of time, which must include at least a part of\ntheoretical life. Philo stresses the fact that in all the Jewish\ncommunities Sabbath was a day for praying and also for devoting\noneself to philosophy (Spec. 2.62), that is, the study of the\nTorah. Does the De uita contemplativa, with its long\ndescription of the life of the Therapeuts of Alexandria, mean that the\ntheoretical life was for Philo the best kind of life, or only a\nphilosopher\u2019s dream? There are many declarations of Philo\nasserting the superiority of the theoretical life. At the same time,\nhe does not imagine this life as an isolated one. To live in the\ndesert does not necessarily mean to live alone. In fact, the desert is\nthe place where the double aspect of virtue appears most clearly,\nwhich is reflection and action at the same time. This duality is once\nagain a common point between Philo and the Stoics, but also an element\nof difference, because no Stoic showed the slightest interest for kind\nof life of the Therapeuts.\n5.5 The sage, the divine man\n\nThe Quod omnis probus is one of the most puzzling Philonian\ntreatises. Despite the fact that Eusebius included it in his catalogue\nof the works of Philo, the question of its authenticity was often\ndiscussed from the middle of the 19th century. The main\narguments against its authenticity were the massive presence of\nStoicism and the lack of any allegoric commentary. Biblical references\nare rare, only five quotations used for an apologetic purpose. From a\nphilosophical point of view, it is not easy to understand how Philo,\nwho was a major user of Stoic topoi, but always showing\ndistance towards them, seems to have fully adopted the paradox of the\nperfect liberty of the sage, even when he is in a situation of\nslavery. Did Philo adopt the Stoic view that the sage embodies the\nperfection of human nature? And how could he reconcile this with the\nJewish conception of a human being marked by Original Sin? More\ngenerally, between Stoicism affirming that the wise man is the equal\nof God and Plato proposing that man assimilate to God to the furthest\nextent possible, where did Philo stand? The first remark is that Philo\ndoes not consider Stoicism an autonomous thought in the\nProbus. According to Philo\u2014if he really was the author\nof the treatise\u2014Zeno, the creator of the Stoa, most likely found\nhis doctrine of human liberty in the Bible, more precisely in Genesis\n27:40, the story of two brothers, one moderate, the other shameless.\nTheir father wanted the shameless to be the slave of the moderate one\nin order to improve the shameless one. The perfection of the sage in\nthe Probus is always subordinated to that of God, who is\ninfinitely superior. In Stoic doctrine, God is the logos, and\nthat means that He and the human being have the same nature, perfect\nin the first case, perfectible in the second one. In Philo\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Bible, the distance between the two is infinite.\nEven if man is created in the image of God, the Philonian negative\ntheology affirms that we know nothing about Him. Philo says in the\nProbus 20 that only he who has no other master than God is\nfree. He adds that this man is also the master of other human beings,\nthe deadly vicar of a Grand Immortal King. In Stoic doctrine, the Sage\nis the King and the next best human beings are his ministers. There is\nno mention of a mightier king. But how can Philo say that a human\nbeing is divine?\n\nLitwa (2014) focuses on the deification of Moses. In conclusion, Litwa\naffirms that \u201cMoses is deified by participating in the\nlogos, the Mind of God, and Philo\u2019s \u2018second\nGod\u2019\u201d (2014: 27). God is the King and God of gods, while\nMoses is only a god with regard to mankind. It can only be added that\nif the Sage embodies the exceptional fulfillment of the human nature\nin Stoicism, in Somn. 2.234, the perfect man is said to be\nneither of an ungenerated nature nor a mortal one. Not only the\ncontext of Middle Platonism but also the beginning of the deification\nof the princeps in the Roman empire can help understand why\nPhilo so easily expressed the idea of the man-god, which seemed to be\nfar from his own convictions. \n6. Conclusion\n\nAnother long article would be necessary to address the Christian\nreception of Philo. Many books and articles provide precious\ninformation on this point (Van den Hoek 1988; Runia 1993, 2009;\nSterling 1998). Philo\u2019s thought was used by the Christian\nfathers in many different ways. Their attitude towards him ranged from\nthe passionate interest of Origen to the accurate attention of Clemens\nto the somewhat stubborn and hostile attitude of Ambrose, who in many\nplaces plagiarizes Philo. Today, Philo is included in the modern\ncategories of \u201cMiddle Platonism\u201d and, still more recent,\n\u201cMiddle Judaism\u201d. In his case these expressions are\nmeaningful. He spent his life \u201cin the middle of\u201d\nantagonistic cultures, violent conflicts, and contrasting\nphilosophical and religious theories. His main legacy in philosophy\nwas the idea that in the face of many harsh human attitudes, there\nwere two complementary ways of remaining free and lucid. The main\nmodel was for him, as it was constantly asserted by Nikiprowetzky, the\nflight, not exactly the Platonic flight of the Theaetetus,\nbut that of Exodus, both a spatial, historical, and vertical flight,\nthe most perfect example of the presence of Transcendence in the\nworld. While the cause of Abraham\u2019s flight was his rejection of\nidolatry, Moses\u2019 project was far more ambitious: not only to\nescape from Egypt, but to build a nation by giving it the Word of God\nas a constitution. But it must be added that there was for Philo also\na kind of Exodus of words. He gathers concepts and themes of\nphilosophy to free them, i.e., to bring them into the light of the God\nof the Torah. Like Moses who knew all the foreign sciences, Philo\nlearned almost everything of philosophy, not in order to be a\nprofessional philosopher, but to demonstrate that the truth the Greeks\nlooked for was where they did not imagine it to be. Philo\u2019s\nconception of oudeneia, the human nothingness, had nothing to\ndo with nihilism. It was the affirmation of the centrality of God\ninstead of the centrality of the self. One could say that this was\ntheology much more than philosophy. But, at the same time, it would be\nan error to say that philosophy remained the same before and after\nPhilo. \nSupplementary Documents\n\nThe Meanings of Philosophy in Philo of Alexandria\nAbout the De aeternitate and the De providentia\nAbbreviations of the Philonian treatises (Studia Philonica Annual)\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Bibliographies", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<h4>Philo: Editions, translations and commentaries</h4>\n<p>\nThe edition of reference is that of Leopald Cohn, Paulus Wendland and\nSiegfried Reiter, <em>Philonis Alexandri opera quae supersunt</em>,\nBerlin 1896\u20131915.
