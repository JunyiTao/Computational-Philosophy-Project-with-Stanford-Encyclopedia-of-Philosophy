Hegel does not provide an exhaustive\naccount of all recognized arts (he says little, for example, about\ndance and nothing, obviously, about cinema), but he examines the five\narts that he thinks are made necessary by the very concept of art\nitself.\n6.3.1 Architecture\n\n\nArt, we recall, is the sensuous expression of divine and human\nfreedom. If it is to demonstrate that spirit is indeed free, it must\nshow that spirit is free in relation to that which is itself unfree,\nspiritless and lifeless\u2014that is, three-dimensional, inorganic\nmatter, weighed down by gravity. Art must, therefore, be the\ntransformation of such brute, heavy matter into the expression of\nspiritual freedom, or what Hegel calls \u201cthe forming of the\ninorganic\u201d (VPK, 209). The art that gives heavy\nmatter the explicit form of spiritual freedom\u2014and so works\nstone and metal into the shape of a human being or a god\u2014is\nsculpture. Architecture, by contrast, gives matter an abstract,\ninorganic form created by human understanding. It does not\nanimate matter in the manner of sculpture but invests matter with\nstrict regularity, symmetry and harmony (PK\u00c4, 155,\n166). In so doing architecture turns matter not into the direct\nsensuous expression of spiritual freedom, but into an artificially and\nartfully shaped surrounding for the direct expression of\nspiritual freedom in sculpture. The art of architecture fulfills its\npurpose, therefore, when it creates classical temples to house statues\nof the gods (VPK, 221).\n\n\nHegel points out, however, that prior to the emergence of classical\narchitecture in ancient Greece, architecture took the more primitive\nform of \u201cindependent\u201d (selbst\u00e4ndig) or\n\u201csymbolic\u201d architecture (Aesthetics, 2: 635;\nPK\u00c4, 159). The constructions that fall into this\ncategory do not house or surround individual sculptures, like classical\nGreek temples, but are themselves partly sculptural and partly\narchitectural. They are works of architectural sculpture or sculptural\narchitecture. Such constructions are sculptural in so far as they are\nbuilt for their own sake and do not serve to shelter or enclose\nsomething else. They are works of architecture, however, in so far as\nthey are overtly heavy and massive and lack the animation of sculpture.\nThey are also sometimes arranged in rows, like columns, with no\ndistinctive individuality.\n\n\nSome of these works of independent architecture have regular inorganic,\ngeometrical shapes (such as the temple of Bel described by Herodotus)\n(see Herodotus, 79\u201380 [1: 181]); some are clearly embodiments of\nthe organic \u201cforce of life in nature\u201d (such as the phallus\nand the lingam) (Aesthetics, 2: 641); and some even have a\nhuman form, albeit one that is abstract and colossal (such as the\nEgyptian Memnons of Amenhotep III). In Hegel\u2019s view, however, all\nsuch constructions have a symbolic significance for those who built\nthem. They were not built simply to provide shelter or security for\npeople (like a house or a castle), but are works of symbolic art.\n\n\nThese \u201cindependent\u201d constructions are meaningful in\nthemselves: their meaning lies, for example, in their shape or in the\nnumber of their parts. By contrast, the Egyptian pyramids contain a\n\u201cmeaning\u201d that is separate from the construction\nitself. That \u201cmeaning,\u201d of course, is the body of the dead\npharaoh. Since they house within themselves something other than\nthemselves, pyramids, in Hegel\u2019s view, are, as it were, on the\nway to being properly architectural. They fall short of proper\nclassical architecture, however, because what they shelter within\nthemselves is death, not the embodiment of the living god: they are, as\nHegel puts it, \u201ccrystals that shelter within them a departed\nspirit\u201d (VPK, 218). Furthermore, the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d that they contain is completely hidden within\nthem, invisible to all. Pyramids thus remain works of symbolic\nart that point to a hidden meaning buried within them. Indeed, as was\nnoted above, Hegel claims that the pyramid is the image or symbol of\nsymbolic art itself (Aesthetics, 1: 356).\n\n\nThe epitome of symbolic art is symbolic architecture (specifically, the\npyramids). Architecture itself, however, comes into its own only with\nthe emergence of classical art: for it is only in the classical period\nthat architecture provides the surrounding for, and so becomes the\nservant of, a sculpture that is itself the embodiment of free\nspirit.\n\n\nHegel has much to say about the proper form of such a surrounding. The\nmain point is this: spiritual freedom is embodied in the sculpture of\nthe god; the house of the god\u2014the temple\u2014is something\nquite distinct from, and subordinate to, the sculpture it surrounds;\nthe form of that temple should thus also be quite distinct from that of\nthe sculpture. The temple, therefore, should not mimic the flowing\ncontours of the human body, but should be governed by the abstract\nprinciples of regularity, symmetry and harmony.\n\n\nHegel also insists that the form of the temple should be determined by\nthe purpose it serves: namely to provide an enclosure and\nprotection for the god (VPK, 221). This means that the\nbasic shape of the temple should contain only those features that are\nneeded to fulfill its purpose. Furthermore, it means (in Hegel\u2019s\nview) that each part of the temple should perform a specific\nfunction within the economy of the whole building and that different\nfunctions should not be confused with one another. It is this latter\nrequirement that makes columns necessary. There is a\ndifference, for Hegel, between the task of bearing the roof and that of\nenclosing the statue within a given space. The second task\u2014that\nof enclosure\u2014is performed by a wall. If the first task is to be\nclearly distinguished from the second, therefore, it must be performed\nnot by a wall but by a separate feature of the temple. Columns are\nnecessary in a classical temple, according to Hegel, because they\nperform the distinct task of bearing the roof without forming\na wall. The classical temple is thus the most intelligible of\nbuildings because different functions are carried out in this way by\ndifferent architectural features and yet are harmonized with one\nanother. Herein, indeed, lies the beauty of such a temple\n(VPK, 221, 224).\n\n\nIn contrast to classical architecture, romantic or \u201cGothic\u201d\narchitecture is based on the idea of a closed house in which Christian\ninwardness can find refuge from the outside world. In the Gothic\ncathedral columns are located within, rather than around the outside\nof, the enclosed space, and their overt function is no longer merely to\nbear weight but to draw the soul up into the heavens. Consequently, the\ncolumns or pillars do not come to a definite end (in a capital on which\nrests the architrave of the classical temple), but continue up until\nthey meet to form a pointed arch or a vaulted roof. In this way, the\nGothic cathedral not only shelters the spirit of the religious\ncommunity, but also symbolizes the upward movement of that spirit in\nits very structure (PK\u00c4, 170\u20131).\n\n\nHegel considers a relatively small range of buildings: he says almost\nnothing, for example, about secular buildings. One should bear in mind,\nhowever, that he is interested in architecture only in so far as it is\nan art, not in so far as it provides us with protection and security in\nour everyday lives. Yet it should also be noted that architecture, as\nHegel describes it, falls short of genuine art, as he defines it, since\nit is never the direct sensuous expression of spiritual freedom itself\n(in the manner of sculpture) (see Aesthetics, 2: 888). This is\na fundamental limitation of architecture: the structures of\n\u201cindependent architecture\u201d symbolize meanings that are more\nor less indeterminate; the pyramids indicate the presence of a hidden\nmeaning, namely death; and even in its classical and romantic forms\narchitecture remains a \u201csymbolic\u201d art, in so far as the\nstructures it creates remain separate from the spirit they house\n(Aesthetics, 2: 888). In no case is architecture the explicit\nmanifestation or embodiment of free spirituality itself. This does not,\nhowever, make architecture any less necessary as a part of our\naesthetic and religious life. Nor does it prevent Hegel from seeking to\nunderstand what distinguishes the \u201cart\u201d of architecture (as\nopposed to the more everyday practice or business of architecture) in\nboth the classical and romantic eras.\n6.3.2 Sculpture\n\n\nIn contrast to architecture, sculpture works heavy matter into the\nconcrete expression of spiritual freedom by giving it the shape of the\nhuman being. The high point of sculpture, for Hegel, was\nachieved in classical Greece. In Egyptian sculpture the figures often\nstand firm with one foot placed before the other and the arms held\ntightly by the side of the body, giving the figures a rather rigid,\nlifeless appearance. By contrast, the idealized statues of the gods\ncreated by Greek sculptors, such as Phidias and Praxiteles, are clearly\nalive and animated, even when the gods are depicted at rest. This\nanimation is apparent in the posture of the figure, in the nuanced\ncontours of the body and also in the free fall of the figure\u2019s\ngarments. Hegel greatly admired the sculpture of Michelangelo\u2014a\ncast of whose Piet\u00e0 he saw in Berlin\n(Aesthetics, 2: 790)\u2014but it was the Greeks, in his\nview, who set the standard for \u201cideal\u201d sculptural beauty.\nIndeed, Greek sculpture, according to Hegel, embodies the purest\nbeauty of which art itself is capable. (For a more detailed study\nof Hegel\u2019s account of sculpture, see Houlgate 2007, \n56\u201389).\n6.3.3 Painting\n\n\nHegel was well aware that Greek statues were often painted in quite\na gaudy manner. He claims, however, that sculpture expresses spiritual\nfreedom and vitality in the three-dimensional shape of the\nfigure, rather than in the color that has been applied to it. In\npainting, by contrast, it is color above all that is the medium of\nexpression. The point of painting, for Hegel, is not to show us what it\nis for free spirit to be fully embodied. It is to show us only\nwhat free spirit looks like, how it manifests itself\nto the eye. The images of painting thus lack the three-dimensionality\nof sculpture, but they add the detail and specificity provided by\ncolor.\n\n\nHegel acknowledges that painting reached a degree of perfection in the\nclassical world, but he maintains that it is best suited to the\nexpression of romantic, Christian spirituality (and the secular freedom\nof post-Reformation modernity) (PK\u00c4, 181). This is\nbecause the absence of bodily solidity and the presence of color allow\nthe more inward spirituality of the Christian world to\nmanifest itself as such. If sculpture is the material embodiment of\nspirit, painting gives us, as it were, the face of spirit in which the\nsoul within manifests itself as the soul within\n(PK\u00c4, 183).\n\n\nPainting, however, is also able\u2014unlike sculpture\u2014to set\ndivine and human spirit in relation to its external environment: it is\nable to include within the painted image itself the natural landscape\nand the architecture by which Christ, the Virgin Mary, the saints or\nsecular figures are surrounded (Aesthetics, 2: 854). Indeed,\nHegel argues that painting\u2014in contrast to sculpture, which\nexcels in presenting independent, free-standing individuals\u2014is\naltogether more suited to showing human beings in their\nrelations both to their environment and to one another: hence\nthe prominence in painting of, for example, depictions of the love\nbetween the Virgin Mary and the Christ child.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of painting is extraordinarily rich and\nwide-ranging. He has particular praise for Raphael, Titian and the\nDutch masters and, as noted earlier, is especially interested in the\nways in which painters can combine colors to create what he calls\n\u201cobjective music\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 599\u2013600). It\nshould be noted, however, that Hegel sees the abstract play of colors\nas an integral part of the depiction of free human beings and does not\nsuggest that painting should ever become purely abstract and\n\u201cmusical\u201d (as it did in the twentieth century).\n6.3.4 Music\n\n\nThe next art in Hegel\u2019s \u201csystem of the individual\narts\u201d is music itself. It, too, comes into its own in the period\nof romantic art. Like sculpture and painting, but unlike architecture,\nmusic gives direct expression to free subjectivity. Yet music goes even\nfurther in the direction of expressing the inwardness of\nsubjectivity by dropping the dimensions of space altogether. It thus\ngives no enduring visual expression to such subjectivity, but\nexpresses the latter in the organized succession of vanishing sounds.\nMusic, for Hegel, originates in the immediate uttering of feeling or\nwhat he calls \u201cinterjection\u201d\u2014\u201cthe Ah\nand Oh of the heart\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 903). Yet music is\nmore than just a cry of pain or a sigh; it is an organized, developed,\n\u201ccadenced\u201d interjection. Music is thus not just a sequence\nof sounds for its own sake, but is the structured expression in sounds\nof inner subjectivity. Through rhythm, harmony and melody music allows\nthe soul to hear its own inner movement and to be moved in turn by what\nit hears. It is \u201cspirit, soul which resounds immediately for\nitself and feels satisfied in hearing itself [in ihrem\nSichvernehmen]\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 939, translation\naltered).\n\n\nMusic expresses, and allows us to hear and enjoy, the movement of the\nsoul in time through difference and dissonance back into its unity with\nitself. It also expresses, and moves us to, various different\nfeelings, such as love, longing and joy (Aesthetics,\n2: 940). In Hegel\u2019s view, however, the purpose of music is not\nonly to arouse feelings in us, but\u2014as in all genuine art\n\u2014to enable us to enjoy a sense of reconciliation and\nsatisfaction in what we encounter. This, Hegel contends, is the secret\nof truly \u201cideal\u201d music, the music of Palestrina, Gluck,\nHaydn and Mozart: even in the deepest grief \u201ctranquillity of soul\nis never missing [ \u2026 ]; grief is expressed there, too, but it is\nassuaged at once; [ \u2026] everything is kept firmly together in a\nrestrained form so that jubilation does not degenerate into a repulsive\nuproar, and even a lament gives us the most blissful\ntranquillity\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 939).\n\n\n Hegel notes that music is able to express feelings with especial\nclarity when it is accompanied by a poetic text, and he had a\nparticular love of both church music and opera. Interestingly, however,\nhe argues that in such cases it is really the text that serves the\nmusic, rather than the other way around, for it is the music above all\nthat expresses the profound movements of the soul (Aesthetics,\n2: 934). Yet music does not have to be accompanied by a text; it can\nalso be \u201cindependent\u201d instrumental music. Such music also\nfulfills the aim of art by expressing the movements of the soul and\nmoving the soul in turn to \u201cemotions in sympathy with it\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 894). Over and above this expression, however,\nindependent music pursues the purely formal development of themes and\nharmonies for its own sake. This, in Hegel\u2019s view, is a perfectly\nappropriate, indeed necessary, thing for music to do. The danger he\nsees, however, is that such formal development can become completely\ndetached from the musical expression of inward feeling and subjectivity, and\nthat, as a result, music can cease being a genuine art and become mere\nartistry. Music, as it were, loses its soul and becomes nothing but\n\u201cskill and virtuosity in compilation\u201d (Aesthetics,\n2: 906). At this point, music no longer moves us to feel\nanything, but simply engages our abstract understanding. It thereby\nbecomes the province of the \u201cconnoisseur\u201d and leaves the\nlayman\u2014who \u201clikes most in music [ \u2026 ] the\nintelligible expression of feelings and ideas\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 953)\u2014behind.\n\n\nHegel admits that he is not as well versed in music as he is in the\nother arts he discusses. He has a deep appreciation, however, for the\nmusic of J.S. Bach, Handel and Mozart and his analyses of musical\nrhythm, harmony and melody are highly illuminating. He was familiar\nwith, though critical of, the music of his contemporary Carl Maria von\nWeber, and he had a particular affection for Rossini\n(Aesthetics, 1: 159, 2: 949). Surprisingly, he never makes any\nmention of Beethoven.\n6.3.5 Poetry\n\n\nThe last art that Hegel considers is also an art of sound, but sound\nunderstood as the sign of ideas and inner representations\u2014sound\nas speech. This is the art of poetry (Poesie) in the\nbroad sense of the term. Hegel regards poetry as the \u201cmost\nperfect art\u201d (PK\u00c4, 197), because it provides the\nrichest and most concrete expression of spiritual freedom (in\ncontrast to sculpture which, in its classical form, gives us the\npurest ideal beauty). Poetry is capable of showing spiritual\nfreedom both as concentrated inwardness and as action in space\nand time. It is equally at home in symbolic, classical and romantic art\nand, in this sense, is the \u201cmost unrestricted of the arts\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 626).\n\n\nPoetry, for Hegel, is not simply the structured presentation of ideas,\nbut the articulation of ideas in language, indeed in spoken\n(rather than just written) language. An important aspect of the art of\npoetry\u2014and what clearly marks it off from prose\u2014is thus\nthe musical ordering of words themselves or\n\u201cversification.\u201d In this respect, Hegel claims, there are\nimportant differences between classical and romantic art: the ancients\nplace more emphasis on rhythmic structure in their verse, whereas in\nChristendom (especially in France and Italy) greater use is made of\nrhyme (PK\u00c4, 201\u20134).\n\n\nThe three basic forms of poetry identified by Hegel are epic, lyric and\ndramatic poetry.\n6.3.5.1 Epic and Lyric poetry\n\n\nEpic poetry presents spiritual freedom\u2014that is, free human\nbeings\u2014in the context of a world of circumstances and events.\n\u201cIn the epic,\u201d Hegel states, \u201cindividuals act and\nfeel; but their actions are not independent, events [also] have their\nright.\u201d What is described in such poetry, therefore, is \u201ca\nplay between actions and events\u201d (PK\u00c4, 208).\nEpic individuals are situated individuals, caught up in a larger\nenterprise (such as the Trojan War in Homer\u2019s Iliad).\nWhat they do is thus determined as much by the situation in which they\nfind themselves as by their own will, and the consequences of their\nactions are to a large degree at the mercy of circumstances. Epic\npoetry thus shows us the worldly character\u2014and\nattendant limitations\u2014of human freedom. (In this respect, Hegel\nnotes, Alexander the Great would not have made a good subject for epic\npoetry, because \u201chis world was his army\u201d\u2014\nhis creation under his control\u2014and so was not\ntruly independent of his will [PK\u00c4, 213].)\n\n\nAmong the great epic poems Hegel discusses are Homer\u2019s\nOdyssey, Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy and the\nmediaeval Spanish poem El Cid. Much of what he has to say\nabout the epic, however, is based on his reading of Homer\u2019s\nIliad. In the modern period, Hegel maintains, the epic gives\nway to the novel (PK\u00c4, 207, 217).\n\n\nIn contrast to the epic hero, the subject of lyric poetry does not\nundertake tasks, journeys or adventures in the world but simply gives\nexpression\u2014in hymns, odes or songs\u2014to the self\u2019s\nideas and inner feelings. This can be done directly or via the poetic\ndescription of something else, such as a rose, wine, or another person.\nAs always, Hegel\u2019s remarks about lyric poetry bear witness to his\nextraordinary erudition and to his critical acumen. He lavishes\nparticular praise on Goethe\u2019s West-Eastern Divan (1819)\nbut criticizes the eighteenth-century poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock\nfor wanting to create a new \u201cpoetic mythology\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1154\u20137; PK\u00c4, 218).\n6.3.5.2 Dramatic Poetry\n\n\nDramatic poetry combines the principles of epic and lyric poetry. It\nshows characters acting in the world\u2014in a given situation\n\u2014but their actions issue directly from their own inner\nwill (rather than being co-determined by events beyond the\nagent\u2019s control). Drama thus presents the\u2014all too often\nself-destructive\u2014consequences of free human action\nitself.\n\n\nDrama, for Hegel, is the \u201chighest\u201d and most concrete art\n(PK\u00c4, 205)\u2014the art in which human beings\nthemselves are the medium of aesthetic expression. (Seeing a play\nperformed by actors, as opposed to hearing it read aloud or reading it\nfor oneself, is thus central, in Hegel\u2019s view, to the experience of\ndrama [Aesthetics, 2: 1182\u20135; PK\u00c4,\n223\u20134].) Drama, indeed, is the art in which all the other arts\nare contained (virtually or actually): \u201cthe human being is the\nliving statue, architecture is represented by painting or there is\nreal architecture,\u201d and\u2014in particular in Greek\ndrama\u2014there is \u201cmusic, dance and pantomime\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 223). At this point, it is tempting to say that,\nfor Hegel, drama\u2014to use Richard Wagner\u2019s expression\u2014is the\n\u201ctotal work of art\u201d (Gesamtkunstwerk). It is\ndoubtful, however, whether Hegel would have been sympathetic to\nWagner\u2019s project. Hegel remarks that drama takes the explicit form of\na \u201ctotality\u201d in opera, which belongs more to the\nsphere of music than to drama proper (PK\u00c4, 223). (He has\nin mind in particular the operas of Gluck and Mozart.) In drama as\nsuch, by contrast, language is what predominates and music plays\na subordinate role and may even be present only in the virtual form of\nversification. The Wagnerian idea of a \u201cmusic drama\u201d that\nis neither a straightforward opera nor a simple drama would thus\nappear, from Hegel\u2019s point of view, to confuse two distinct arts.\n\n\nDrama, for Hegel, does not depict the richness of the epic world or\nexplore the inner world of lyric feeling. It shows characters acting in\npursuit of their own will and interest and thereby coming into\nconflict with other individuals (even if, as in the case of Hamlet,\nafter some initial hesitation). Hegel distinguishes between tragic and\ncomic drama and between classical and romantic versions of each. (He\nalso notes that in some plays, such as Goethe\u2019s Iphigenie auf\nTauris, tragedy threatens but is averted by acts of trust or\nforgiveness [Aesthetics, 2: 1204].)\n\n\nIn classical Greek tragedy individuals are moved to act by an\nethical interest or \u201cpathos,\u201d such as concern for\nthe family or for the state. The conflict between Antigone and Creon in\nSophocles\u2019 Antigone is of this kind, as is the conflict\nacted out in Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia. In Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus the King the conflict is not a straightforwardly\nethical one, but it is nonetheless a conflict between two\n\u201crights\u201d: the right of consciousness to accept\nresponsibility only for what it knows it has done, and the right of the\n\u201cunconscious\u201d\u2014of what we do not know\u2014to be\naccorded respect. The tragedy of Oedipus is that he pursues his right\nto uncover the truth about the murder of Laius without ever considering\nthat he himself might be responsible for the murder or, indeed, that\nthere might be anything about him of which he is unaware\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1213\u201314).\n\n\nGreek tragic heroes and heroines are moved to act by the ethical (or\notherwise justified) interest with which they identify, but they act\nfreely in pursuit of that interest. Tragedy shows how such\nfree action leads to conflict and then to the violent (or sometimes\npeaceful) resolution of that conflict. At the close of the drama, Hegel\nmaintains, we are shattered by the fate of the characters (at least\nwhen the resolution is violent). We are also satisfied by the outcome,\nbecause we see that justice has been done. Individuals, whose\ninterests\u2014such as the family and the state\u2014should be in\nharmony with one another, set those interests in opposition to one\nanother; in so doing, however, they destroy themselves and thereby undo\nthe very opposition they set up. In the self-destruction of such\n\u201cone-sidedly\u201d ethical characters, Hegel believes, we, the\naudience, see the work of \u201ceternal justice\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1198, 1215). This reconciles us to\nthe fate of the characters and so provides the sense of\n\u201creconciliation which art should never lack\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1173).\n\n\nIn modern tragedy\u2014by which Hegel means above all Shakespearean\ntragedy\u2014characters are moved not by an ethical interest, but by\na subjective passion, such as ambition or jealousy. These characters,\nhowever, still act freely and destroy themselves through the free\npursuit of their passion. Tragic individuals, therefore\u2014whether\nancient or modern\u2014are not brought down by fate but are\nultimately responsible for their own demise. Indeed, Hegel maintains,\n\u201cinnocent suffering is not the object of high art\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 231\u20132). Drama that sees people primarily as\nvictims of circumstance or oppression (such as Georg\nB\u00fcchner\u2019s Woyzeck [1836]) is thus, from a Hegelian point\nof view, drama without genuine tragedy.\n\n\nIn comedy individuals also undermine their own endeavors in some way,\nbut the purposes that animate them are either inherently trivial ones\nor grand ones which they pursue in a laughably inappropriate way. In\ncontrast to tragic characters, truly comic figures do not identify\nthemselves seriously with their laughable ends or means. They can thus\nsurvive the frustration of their purposes, and often come to laugh at\nthemselves, in a way that tragic figures cannot. In this respect, Hegel\nclaims, characters in many modern comedies, such as those by\nMoli\u00e8re, are frequently ridiculous, but not genuinely\ncomic, characters: we laugh at Moli\u00e8re\u2019s\nmiser or Shakespeare\u2019s Malvolio, but they do not laugh\nwith us at their own foibles. Truly comic figures are found\nby Hegel in the plays of the ancient Greek dramatist\nAristophanes. What we encounter in such plays, Hegel maintains, is\n\u201can infinite light-heartedness and confidence felt by someone\nraised altogether above his own inner contradiction and not bitter or\nmiserable in it at all: this is the bliss and ease of a man who, being\nsure of himself, can bear the frustration of his aims and\nachievements\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 1200). Modern equivalents\nof such Aristophanic light-heartedness may be found in\nVerdi\u2019s Falstaff (1893) and in the unrivalled comic genius of\nHomer Simpson, both of which, of course, were unknown to Hegel. \n\n\nComedy, in Hegel\u2019s view, marks the \u201cdissolution of\nart\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 1236). Yet the way in which comedy\n\u201cdissolves\u201d art differs from the way in which modern ironic\nhumor does so. Ironic humor\u2014at least of the kind found in the\nwork of Jean Paul Richter\u2014is the expression of the \u201cpower\nof subjective notions, flashes of thought\u201d to \u201cdestroy and\ndissolve everything that proposes to make itself objective\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 601). It is the expression of the unchallenged\nmastery of wit. Since Hegel does not regard such arbitrary mastery as\ngenuine freedom, he argues that works of ironic humor in which this\nmastery is exhibited no longer count as genuine works of art. True\ncomedy, by contrast, is the expression of a sense of wholeness,\nself-confidence and well-being\u2014of subjective freedom and life\n\u2014that survives the loss of mastery and control over\none\u2019s life. Plays that express such freedom count as genuine\nworks of art. Yet they are works that show freedom to reside precisely\nnot in the works we undertake but within subjectivity\nitself, within subjectivity that happily endures the frustration of its\nlaughable aims.\n\n\nAccording to Hegel, the idea that true freedom is to be found in inner\nspirituality that is prepared to let go of, or to \u201cdie to,\u201d\nits own selfish purposes lies at the heart of religion,\nspecifically of Christianity. True comedy, therefore, implicitly points\nbeyond art to religion. It is in this way\u2014and not by\nceasing to be art\u2014that comedy \u201cdissolves\u201d art.\n\n\nComedy thus takes art to its limit: beyond comedy there is no further\naesthetic manifestation of freedom, there is only religion\n(and philosophy). Religion, in Hegel\u2019s view, does not make the\naesthetic expression of freedom redundant; indeed, it is often the\nsource of the greatest art. Yet religion provides a more profound\nunderstanding of freedom than art, just as philosophy provides a\nclearer and more profound understanding of freedom than religion.\n",
