Why Holist Explanations are Indispensable\n\nThis section examines some of the most important arguments offered in\nsupport of the claim that holist explanations are indispensable within\nthe social sciences. All the arguments have been advocated by moderate\nmethodological holists. Only the first version of the first argument\nhas also, and perhaps mainly, been propounded by strong methodological\nholists. The arguments should all be read as defenses of the\nindispensability of holist explanations understood as final\nexplanations.\n",
