    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Nature\n5. Aesthetics and Nature\n\nOne of the romantics\u2019 central aims was to (re)enchant nature in\nthe face of what they regarded as a threat from modern science. The\nthreat was embodied primarily in the worry that modern science\nalienated (rational and free) human beings from nature, which, through\nthe lens of this new science, had been viewed as a domain of brute,\ndetermined, mechanical causality\n (\u00a75.1).\n Aesthetics is capable of (re)enchanting nature insofar as it brings\nout a different conception of nature as organic rather than mechanic.\nOn this organic conception, nature is (a) an organic whole, which is\nreciprocally interdependent on its parts; (b) a domain of teleological\nrather than merely mechanical causality; and (c) a dynamic and living\nforce, which is self-organizing and self-generating\n (\u00a75.2).\n \u201cScience should become poetic\u201d insofar as it should\napproach nature in the same way that criticism approaches romantic\npoetry. Like romantic poetry, nature should be viewed as an organic\nand spontaneous whole. Under this conception of nature, rational,\nautonomous human beings are not alienated from, but are rather part\nand parcel of, nature\n (\u00a75.3).\n",
