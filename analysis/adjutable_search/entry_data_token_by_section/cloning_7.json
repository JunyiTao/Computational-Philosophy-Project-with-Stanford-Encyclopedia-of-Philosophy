    "main_text": "Human Reproductive Cloning || Safety and Efficiency\n3.1 Safety and Efficiency\n\nDespite the successful creation of viable offspring via SCNT in\nvarious mammalian species, researchers still have limited\nunderstanding of how the technique works on the subcellular and\nmolecular level. Although the overall efficiency and safety of\nreproductive cloning in mammals has significantly increased over the\npast fifteen years, it is not yet a safe process (Whitworth &\nPrather 2010). For example, the rate of abortions, stillbirths and\ndevelopmental abnormalities remains high. Another source of concern is\nthe risk of premature ageing because of shortened telomeres. Telomeres\nare repetitive DNA sequences at the tip of chromosomes that get\nshorter as an animal gets older. When the telomeres of a cell get so\nshort that they disappear, the cell dies. The concern is that cloned\nanimals may inherit the shortened telomeres from their older\nprogenitor, with possibly premature aging and a shortened lifespan as\na result.\n\nFor many, the fact that reproductive cloning is unsafe provides a\nsufficient reason not to pursue it. It has been argued that it would\nsimply be wrong to impose such significant health risks on humans. The\nstrongest version of this argument states that it would be wrong now\nto produce a child using SCNT because it would constitute a case of\nwrongful procreation. Some adopt a consent-based objection and condemn\ncloning because the person conceived cannot consent to being exposed\nto significant risks involved in the procedure (Kass 1998; PCBE 2002).\nAgainst this, it has been argued that even if reproductive cloning is\nunsafe, it may still be permissible if there are no safer means to\nbring that very same child into existence so long as the child is\nexpected to have a life worth living (Strong 2005).\n\nWith the actual rate of advancement in cloning, one cannot exclude a\nfuture in which the safety and efficiency of SCNT will be comparable\nor superior to that of IVF or even sexual reproduction. A remaining\nquestion is, then, whether those who condemn cloning because of its\nexperimental nature should continue to condemn it morally and legally.\nSome authors have reasoned that if, in the future, cloning becomes\nsafer than sexual reproduction, we should even make it our\nreproductive method of choice (Fletcher 1988; Harris 2004, Ch. 4).\n\n",
