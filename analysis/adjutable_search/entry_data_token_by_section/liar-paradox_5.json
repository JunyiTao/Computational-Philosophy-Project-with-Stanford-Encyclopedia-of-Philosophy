    "main_text": "Basic Ingredients\n2. Basic Ingredients\n\nWe have already seen a kind of characteristic reasoning that goes with\nthe Liar. We have also seen some common structure across all our\nexample Liar paradoxes, such as the presence of truth predicates, and\nsomething like negation. We pause here to discuss these ingredients of\nthe paradox, focusing on the basic Liars. Just what creates\nthe Liar paradox, and just which of the puzzles we just surveyed is\n\u2018basic\u2019, is a contentious matter; different approaches to\nsolving the Liar view these matters differently. Hence, our goal is\nmerely to illuminate some common themes across different Liars, not to\noffer a full diagnosis of the source of the paradox.\n\nWe highlight three aspects of the Liar: the role of truth predicates,\nthe kinds of principles for reasoning about truth that are needed, and\nthe way that a paradox can be derived given these resources.\n",
