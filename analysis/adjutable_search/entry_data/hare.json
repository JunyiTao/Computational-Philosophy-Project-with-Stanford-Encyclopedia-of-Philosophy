    "preamble": "\n\nRichard Hare left behind at his death a long essay titled \u201cA\nPhilosophical Autobiography\u201d, which was published after his\ndeath. Its opening is striking:\n\n\nI had a strange dream, or half-waking vision, not long ago. I found\nmyself at the top of a mountain in the mist, feeling very pleased with\nmyself, not just for having climbed the mountain, but for having\nachieved my life\u2019s ambition, to find a way of answering moral\nquestions rationally. But as I was preening myself on this\nachievement, the mist began to clear, and I saw that I was surrounded\non the mountain top by the graves of all those other philosophers,\ngreat and small, who had had the same ambition, and thought they had\nachieved it.  And I have come to see, reflecting on my dream, that,\never since, the hard-working philosophical worms had been nibbling\naway at their systems and showing that the achievement was an\nillusion. (2002: 269)\n\n\nYet his imagination could also be less modest: a gaggle of moral\nphilosophers is trapped beneath the earth in a smoke-filled chamber;\nthey talk at cross purposes, and refuse to take the way out into the\nopen air that he alone has discovered. It was his ambition to have\nunited elements from Aristotle, Kant, and Mill in a logically cogent\nway that solved the fundamental problems of ethics (though leaving\nunfinished business), and he usually believed himself to have achieved\nthis. For much of his career, his \u201cprescriptivism\u201d formed\nan important part of the curriculum, certainly in Britain. His\ndisappointment was not to have persuaded others (an occasional\n\u201cwe prescriptivists\u201d was always uncertain of reference),\nand to have left no disciples; he once told John Lucas that this made\nhis life a failure. Yet he leaves behind generations of pupils\ngrateful for the transmission not of a doctrine but of a discipline;\nand posterity, while unlikely to ratify the logical validity of his\ntheory, will have reason to admire it for its uniting of apparent\nopposites, freedom and reason, tradition and rationalism, eclecticism\nand rigor.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Life and the Man\n\n\nRichard Mervyn Hare was born at Backwell Down, outside Bristol, on 21\nMarch 1919. He was to be known professionally as R.M.  Hare, and\npersonally as Dick Hare. His father, Charles Francis Aubone Hare, was\ndirector of a firm, John Hare & Co., making paint and floor-cloth;\nhis mother was Louise Kathleen Simonds, of a brewing and banking\nfamily. His parents died while he was still young. He was then cared\nfor chiefly by guardians and relatives on his mother\u2019s side, being\nsent to school first at Copthorne in Sussex, and then, from 1932 to\n1937, as a classical scholar at Rugby. He was awarded a scholarship to\nBalliol College in 1937, where he read two years of Greats before the\noutbreak of war.\n\n\nDespite a largely classical education, Hare\u2019s mind was already turning\ntowards moral philosophy. He ascribed this to two things, the need to\ndefine an attitude towards fighting, and a feeling of guilt at living\nin moderate comfort. He spent much time while still at Rugby working\nwith the unemployed, and finally decided not to be a pacifist, but to\njoin the OTC. When war broke out, he volunteered for service in the\nRoyal Artillery, and circumvented the results of a medical test in\norder to be permitted active service overseas. He was eventually put\non a ship for India in autumn 1940. He had a year training Punjabi\nsoldiers, and enjoying some adventures (twice finding his own way back\nthrough the jungle, once after losing his guns to the Japanese). He\nwas finally taken prisoner when Singapore fell in February 1942. He\nthen suffered a long march up the River Kwai to near the Three Pagodas\nPass, with a group of officers whose task was to work as coolies\nbuilding the railway from Siam into Burma. So he knew too well the\n\u201cviolent untiring labours\u201d that Aristotle associates with\nvirtue in an ode to a dead friend that was dear to Hare\u2019s heart. He\nwrites in his autobiography, \u201cI prefer to pass over our\nsufferings during the eight months we were there\u201d (2002: 283);\nhe rarely mentioned them (except when more fortunate critics of his\nviews rashly imputed to him the exemption from a wider experience of\nlife that can be the privilege of an Oxford fellowship). He was\neventually imprisoned with fellow officers in Singapore, whence he was\nreleased after exactly three and a half years when the War ended.\n\n\nAfter the war, Hare returned to Balliol to complete the four years of\nGreats. Even before he sat Finals, he was offered a lectureship at\nBalliol, which almost immediately became a fellowship. Hare always\nclaimed to have learnt a lot from his pupils, and his early years at\nBalliol granted him outstanding ones\u2014four of whom, Bernard\nWilliams, David Pears, Richard Wollheim, and John Lucas, were to join\nhim both as professional philosophers, and as Fellows of the British\nAcademy. Lucas narrates how he and his contemporaries would plan a\nday\u2019s campaigning, with a succession of tutees concerting, through the\nday, objections to some settled opinion of Hare\u2019s, and replies to his\nreplies\u2014with Williams sent in last to deliver the coup de\ngr\u00e2ce that was never, in the event, fatal. No one who never\nexperienced Hare\u2019s impromptu fielding of objections can really\nunderstand the resilience of even his less plausible convictions. And\nyet, despite some impressions, he was quite capable of admitting the\nforce of fair counter-arguments. He had a faith that apparent\ndisagreements can usually be resolved once confusions are removed\n(whence the over-sanguine title of his last book, Sorting Out\nEthics, 1997a). This went with a presumption that objections to\nhis views rested on confusion, one that could lead to a degree of\nasperity. He recognized that the brusquely economical format of his\n\u201cComments\u201d within Hare and Critics (which he\nseriously wanted to be titled, after a pub-name familiar in England,\n\u201cHare and Hounds\u201d) might be taken amiss (1988a: 201):\nIn case anybody thinks that I have been discourteous to\nmy critics in writing notes instead of essays, I must point out that\nthis is what we commonly do to Plato and Aristotle (as in the\nClarendon series of commentaries), taking their arguments one by one\nand treating them briskly but seriously.\n\n\nThere could be a complaint that Hare was most interested in his own\nideas. John Lucas had from Tom Braun a Balliol rhyme (of which he\ncites a variant version in Lucas 2002: 31) dating from soon after the\npublication of The Language of Morals (1952):\n\n\nMy pupils I have always taught You cannot get an \u201cis\u201d\nfrom \u201cought\u201d.  This is the burden of my song:\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my book, or else it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt is true that Hare was most appreciative of points helpful to his\nown reconsiderations; he could then be depended upon to be\nover-generous. He always disparaged his own scholarship, though from a\ndemanding point of view. (Few writers of long books on Plato can have\nfirst re-read the whole of Plato in Greek, as Hare did before writing\nhis very short one, 1982.) Yet his interests were wider in range than\nhis publications, and extended through Frege, Chomsky, Davidson, and a\nfair range of contemporary philosophy of mind and language. Though he\nwas keen to claim ancestry (in a late encyclopedia article he counts\nSocrates and Aristotle as, in part, the first prescriptivists; 1998:\n20), his love of philosophy did not reduce at all to a love of his own\nphilosophy.\n\n\nHis most amiable aspects were apparent to the undergraduates (by\npreference) whom, from early on, he invited to one of his\nreading-parties, first at Plas Rhoscolyn in Anglesey, and later also\nat Saffron House in Ewelme, beneath the Chilterns. It was there above\nall that he vividly communicated a sense of how worthwhile and\nenjoyable it is not just to read but to do philosophy. He was\nthus, however exacting his standards, a most positive figure as a\nmentor, giving of himself in discussion in a manner that could be\nopinionated but was also self-forgetful. He was a Puritan of the\ntraditional kind who shared Dr Johnson\u2019s approval of \u201charmless\npleasures\u201d. He was concerned about the case against eating meat;\nbut his eventual virtual vegetarianism was rather caused, he said, by\ngardening than by argument. Some of his dislikes were distinctive: the\nmusic of Beethoven (which he came to find superficial), wearing socks\n(which he ascribed to commercialism), drinking coffee (which he said\naffected his temper), travelling by train (which caused him anxiety),\ngiving and receiving presents (when the recipient best knows what he\nwants). Ved Mehta (1962) recalls his working, for freedom from\ninterruption, in a caravan on the front lawn of his house in\nOxford. He had the courage, though not the extravagance, to be an\neccentric.\n\n\nIt was initially at reading parties that his pupils encountered a part\nof his life equally important to him as philosophy, his wife and\nchildren. What he describes as \u201ca night of mostly bad\ndreams\u201d, starting with his mother\u2019s death in 1935, ended with\nhis marriage in 1947 to Catherine Verney, which he calls \u201cthe\nbest thing I ever did, and a source of lasting happiness\u201d (2002:\n272 & 292). They shared a love of traditional Anglicanism (though\nher beliefs were more orthodox than his), and of music (especially\nchoral and a cappella). A Hare reading party at Ewelme was\nalways in part a music camp, with (for all those able to join in) a\npiano to play and madrigals to sing.  Everything equally involved\ntheir four children, John (who has published about his father, 2007:\n184\u2013248), and three daughters.  Without them, he would have felt\nincomplete even as a moral philosopher; for Aristotle\u2019s question\n\u201cWhat sort of person should I be?\u201d gave way, for him, to\nthe question \u201cWhat sort of person should I bring up my children\nto be?\u201d\n\n\nHare remained a tutor at Balliol for twenty years, and always felt\nattached to that institution above all others (whence the bequest of\nhis Nachlass). It was still during his time there, in 1964,\nthat he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. However,\nineluctable promotion eventually removed him, in 1966, to the White\u2019s\nChair of Moral Philosophy at Corpus Christi. There he took on a\nresponsibility for the supervision of research students.  (Balliol and\nCorpus Greats pupils still had the benefit of his reading parties,\nwhich for a time, while John was at Balliol, became biennial.)  He\nalso took his turn as chairman of the Philosophy Panel, which admits\nand oversees graduates, and chairman of the Faculty Board.\nAdministration, it may be said, was a task with which he coped\nadmirably, but, also admirably, refused to identify.\n\n\nHe recalls that most of his cousins on his mother\u2019s side were\nAmericans; and two of his children emigrated to America and married\nAmericans. Like all distinguished Oxford philosophers, he received\nmany invitations there (of which the most welcome was to the Center\nfor Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, where he\nwrote both Moral Thinking, 1981, and his little\nbook Plato, 1982). All this made less improbable his early\nretirement from Oxford in 1983, and his appointment as Graduate\nResearch Professor of Philosophy at the University of Florida at\nGainesville. One desire was to escape from faculty politics at\nOxford. A contributing factor was the publication of Moral\nThinking, which left him immediately, he confessed, nothing new\nto say in his staple lectures.  Yet his main motive was the prospect\nof helping to set up a Center for Applied Philosophy.\n\n\nThe very phrase \u201capplied ethics\u201d, now so familiar (and\nyet, one may think, tendentious), presupposes a tradition of ethical\ntheories, such as his, that invite practical applications. In fact, he\npublished his first paper in practical ethics, titled \u201cEthics\nand Politics\u201d, in the Listener (1955). (Part of it is\ncollected, under the title \u201cCan I be Blamed for Obeying\nOrders?\u201d, in Hare 1972a; there it is followed by three papers\noriginally published in the 1950s, and more from the 1960s.) Better\nknown is the last chapter of Freedom and Reason (1963), which\naddressed the issue, then (it seemed) wholly recalcitrant, of\napartheid. And much else followed, with a stream of papers, and\nmemberships of various advisory bodies (Hare 2002: 294\u20135). He\nwas engaged especially by urban planning, where he favored radial over\nring roads, and biomedical ethics, in which he labored to be logical\nand not just bien pensant. When a Society for Applied\nPhilosophy was formed, he became its first President. So he looked\nforward to a profitable refocusing of his energies; and this, to an\nextent, occurred, even when the Center partly disappointed. As he\nnotes, three out of four volumes of essays published between 1989 and\n1993 fall within practical ethics (Hare 1989b, 1992a, 1993a).\n\n\nHis time in Gainesville was disturbed by the first, and slightest, of\nhis strokes. When he fully returned with Catherine to Ewelme in 1994,\nfurther attacks cheated him of his hopes of continuing to combat\n\u201cthe usual misunderstandings\u201d (2002: 304\u20135). He gave\nhis last paper, appropriately, to an undergraduate audience at King\u2019s\nCollege London. He was still able to put together Sorting Out\nEthics (1997a), deriving from the Axel H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m Lectures that\nhe had given at Uppsala University in 1991 (when he also received an\nhonorary doctorate\u2014his first doctorate\u2014from the University\nof Lund). His eightieth birthday was marked by the publication of a\nfinal collection of papers, Objective Prescriptions and other\nessays (1999). He died suddenly but peacefully on 29 January\n2002.\n2. The Language of Morals\n\n\nPhilosophically, Hare came under two influences that together led him\nto views that he could always retain. One was emotivism. He followed\nthis in accepting a broadly empiricist view of facts that excluded\nmoral facts in any unetiolated sense of \u201cfact\u201d.  However,\nhe never adopted the verification principle of meaning in any\nthorough-going way. He also recoiled from any causal account of\n\u201cemotive meaning\u201d that reduced moral discourse to\nemotional manipulation. It became a recurrent theme that emotivism\nwent wrong by connecting the meaning of moral language with its\nperlocutionary, rather than its illocutionary, force (1997a:\n112\u201314), that is, with what we do by\nor through using it, rather than what we do in using\nit.\n\n\nThe other influence was Kantian. From H.J. Paton\u2019s lectures on Kant,\nand articles by Reginald Jackson, he learnt that imperatives fall\nwithin the realm of reason. This led him into a study of imperative\nlogic, a topic already being explored in Scandinavia (especially by\nAlf Ross), but unfamiliar in Britain. In his first published article,\n\u201cImperative Sentences\u201d (1949), in his essay\n\u201cPractical Reason\u201d entered for the T.H. Green Moral\nPhilosophy prize in 1950, and in his first book, The Language of\nMorals (1952), he explored the possibilities of inferring\nimperative conclusions from imperative, or a combination of imperative\nand indicative, premises.\n\nThe Language of Morals introduced a distinction between\nprescriptive and descriptive meaning. Prescriptive meaning is defined\nin relation to imperatives: a statement is prescriptive if it entails,\nif necessary in conjunction with purely factual statements, at least\none imperative; and to assent to an imperative is to prescribe action.\nDescriptive meaning is defined in relation to truth-conditions: a\nstatement is descriptive to the extent that factual conditions for its\ncorrect application define its meaning. It is taken for granted, in\nthe tradition of Hume, that the factual is only contingently\nmotivating: desire is no part of sincere assent to a purely factual\nstatement. A moral statement has prescriptive meaning, but may also be\npartly descriptive. Thus \u201cA [a person] ought\nto \u03c6\u201d entails the imperative\n\u201cLet A \u03c6\u201d, so that to assent to it sincerely\nis to have an overriding desire (which in application to oneself will\namount, if its satisfaction appears practicable, to an intention)\nthat A \u03c6. If there are agreed reasons for \u03c6-ing\nwithin a linguistic community, say that it is enjoyable,\n\u201cA ought to \u03c6\u201d may take on the descriptive\nimplication of \u201c\u03c6-ing is\nenjoyable\u201d. \u201cX is a good F\u201d\nprescribes choice within a certain range (e.g., for someone who is\nchoosing an F); it takes on a descriptive connotation if\nthere are agreed standards for assessing Fs.\n\n\nHare never said that ethical statements are imperatives;\nhowever, it is striking that non-descriptive or evaluative meaning is\ndefined in terms of imperatives. This at once gave a clear sense to\nhis endorsement of Hume\u2019s denial that one can derive an\n\u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d. It also coincided, at\nleast in appearance, with Kant, and was to become essential for later\ndevelopments that brought results comparable to Kant\u2019s. However, a\nHumean who lacked Kant\u2019s belief in a purely rational will might prefer\nto make ethical statements more loosely expressive of wish or desire,\nor even aspiration; and this could avoid what is everyone\u2019s first\nobjection to prescriptivism, that, intuitively, \u201cI ought\nto \u03c6\u201d does not entail \u201cI will \u03c6\u201d\n(expressing intention). Hare took courage from the fact that Socrates\nand Aristotle incur much the same objection; as he liked to urge,\nSocrates wasn\u2019t simply making a mistake. His initial reply was that\ncases of failing to try to do what one admits one ought to do may\ninvolve psychological incapacity, or an off-color use of\n\u201cought\u201d that sheds its full prescriptive meaning. He was\nto return more fully to the issue in a chapter of his second\nbook, Freedom and Reason (1963), and again in a late\nencyclopedia article, \u201cWeakness of the Will\u201d (1992). In\nthis last piece he acknowledges that different things go wrong in\ndifferent cases. At times, the true story may even involve something\nlike Plato\u2019s partition of the soul (which was designed to accommodate\nconscious self-contradiction).\n3. The Logic of Imperatives\n\n\nHare\u2019s attempt to ground a logic of imperatives was innovative, but\nproblematic. One uncertainty is about its field. He supposes that\nthere is a genus of tellings to that extends over commands,\norders, instructions, givings of advice, and even\u2014when the\nimperative is self-addressed\u2014forming desires and\nintentions. These belong together in sharing a direction of\nfit or onus of match that contrasts them\nwith tellings that which convey information and express\nstates of belief or of knowledge. Crudely, if I tell you\nthat p, and p is false, then, if anything, it is my\nutterance that is out of order; if I tell you to do X, and you\ndon\u2019t do X, then, if anything, it is your action that is out of\norder. The general idea is that, just as, if I tell you\nthat p, I am implicitly telling you that q, if it is\ncommon knowledge between us that p entails q, so, if\nI tell you to do X, I am implicitly telling you to do Y,\nif we know that\u2014well, this is what has to be determined.\n\n\nIt is arguable that the notion of implicitly prescribing\nfails to determine any logic of imperatives (Price 2004b: \u00a74).\nLater papers of Hare\u2019s focused upon various problem cases.  I shall\nconsider three of these here, all of which admit possible solutions\neither proposed, or proposable, by Hare.\n\n(1) The simplest examples involve only imperative sentences. These may\ninvite the simple thought that one imperative entails another if the\nfirst cannot be satisfied without the second being satisfied also\n(Hare identifies this as a \u201clogic of satisfaction\u201d, 1971a:\n63). This may seem plausible in the following case:\n\n\n(A)\nDo X and Y. So, do X.\n\n\n\nLess plausible, however, may appear to be this:\n\n\n(B) Do X.\nSo, do X or Y.\n\n(Hare discusses the following instance, \u201cPost the letter; so\npost the letter or burn it\u201d, 1967: 25\u201334). And yet it is\nequally true with (B) as with (A) that the premise cannot be satisfied\nwithout the conclusion being satisfied. Moreover, (B) can be derived\nfrom (A) by contraposition and substitution. If (A) is valid, so\nshould (C) be:\n\n\n(C)\n Don\u2019t do X.\nSo, don\u2019t (do X and Y).\nSo, do not X or not Y.\n\n\nThen we have only to replace \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d by \u201cdo\u201d,\nand we have (B).\n\n\nWilliams (1962/3) judged (B) to be invalid, on the ground that its\nconclusion carried a \u201cpermissive presupposition\u201d that the\nhearer may do X or do Y. Hare defended it on the ground\nthat the permission is a conversational implicature that is cancelled\nin the context defined by the premise\n\u201cDo X\u201d. However, even (A) may be less plausible\nthan it looks. Take this example (which comes from Bob Hale):\n\n(D)\n Light the fuse and step back three paces.\nSo, light the fuse.\n\n\n\nIt is certainly true that the conclusion reiterates part of\nwhat was prescribed in the premise. And yet I may hesitate to tell\nsomeone to light the fuse, even when I am happy to tell him to light\nthe fuse and step back, if I know that, given his tendency to be\ncarried away, he is most likely, if he lights the fuse, not\nto remember to step back. (As we might put the point in terms of\npossible worlds, I won\u2019t tell him to light the fuse if the closest\nworld to this one in which he lights the fuse is one where he forgets\nto step back; indeed, one solution is to require, for the inference to\ngo through, the addition of a factual premise to the effect that if he\nlights the fuse, he will remember to step back.) And how can\nI be telling someone implicitly to do a thing that I would be\nunwilling to tell him to do explicitly?\n\n\nAgain, however, Hare would presumably say that any suggestion,\nimplicit in the entailed \u201cLight the fuse\u201d, that the hearer\nshould focus upon lighting the fuse is corrected in context by the\ninitial instruction that he then step back.\n\n\n(2) New problems arise when we have mixed inferences, involving\nindicative as well as imperative premises. The simplest way of\nextending a logic of satisfaction to these is by the following rule: a\nset of premises entails a conclusion if the premises cannot be true\n(if indicative) or satisfied (if imperative) without the conclusion\nbeing true or satisfied also. However, we also need restrictive rules\nof which an example (already stated in 1952: 28) would be that no\nimperative conclusion can be drawn from purely indicative\npremises\u2014but that is doubtless too simple. Take an example from\nAristotle\u2019s De Motu Animalium (7, 701a19\u201322). It\ninvolves reasoning from one intention to another. Given Hare\u2019s\nwillingness to represent intentions as self-addressed imperatives, we\ncan rewrite it as follows:\n\n(E)\n Let me make a cloak.\nIf I make a cloak, I must do such-and-such.\nSo, let me do such-and-such.\n\n\n\nHere, if the second premise is true, the first premise cannot be\nsatisfied without the conclusion\u2019s being satisfied also; so the\ninference goes through on a logic of satisfaction.\n\n\nNow this evidently needs to be restricted. Take the following:\n\n(F)\n Let me get drunk.\nWhoever gets drunk is bound to have a hangover.\nSo, let me have a hangover.\n\n\nIt is true that, if I advise someone \u201cGet drunk\u201d, he might\nrespond \u201cAre you telling me to have a hangover?\u201d Yet this\ninference is not acceptable as leading from one intention to another;\nfor predicted side-effects of realizing one\u2019s intentions are not\nthereby intended, even if (in another case) they are\nwelcome. Inferences that may take one from one intention to another\nneed rather to relate, as Aristotle intended (E) (though its wording is actually ambiguous), to means towards, or ways of,\nachieving a given goal.\n\n\nYet further problems arise. Suppose that I intend to achieve some\nunforgettable end, and recognize that it will require, in due course,\na presently forgettable means. (Suppose that I am already set on\nmaking a cloak, an end which already looms large in my mind; but some\nsubsidiary means that I know to be necessary in due course can only\nbecome salient when the time approaches\u2014I cannot now form an\nintention to realize the means since I know that I would at once\nforget it until my intention to realize the end reminded me of them at\nan opportune moment.) I then already intend the end,\nbut cannot as yet seriously intend the means; for it is\nplausibly part of having a present intention to do something that one\nexpects one\u2019s intention to play a role in a causal sequence\nculminating in one\u2019s doing it.\n\n\nWhat would Hare say to all this? He can reply that while a\nself-addressed imperative may express an intention, it can also fail\nto do so, and that this puts no limits on a logic of prescriptions. If\nI tell someone to get drunk, knowing that this will produce a\nhangover, I am telling him to have a hangover, even\nwithout intending this. Further, it was already a condition\non a prescription\u2019s expressing an intention that its realization\nappears to the subject to be practicable; it can now be added that I\ncan only form an intention now if I expect it to contribute to the\nsatisfaction of the prescription. This then becomes a refinement, and\nnot an objection.\n\n\n(3) A problem that we all face is how to reconcile the following two\nconditional imperatives. (I take my example from Price 2008: 60; but\nit is of a kind that Hare was long conscious of, and discusses in Hare\n1968.)\n\n(a)\nIf you want to get drunk every evening,\n you should work in a bar.\n(b)\nIf you want to get drunk every evening,\n you shouldn\u2019t work in a bar.\n\n\n\nThese look contradictory, but need not be in any way inconsistent: (a)\nmay be true in that working in a bar is the only way through which you\ncan manage to get drunk every evening; (b) may be true in that, given\nthat you are a potential alcoholic with a weak will, not working in a\nbar is a necessary condition of your maintaining your health (which\nyou either are much concerned about, or ought to\nbe). We can distinguish (a) and (b) most clearly by asking how to\ndetach the consequent. This seems straightforward in the case of (b):\none can detach \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t work in a bar\u201d from (b) by\nasserting \u201cYou (do) want to get drunk every evening\u201d. But\nhow, if at all, can we detach the consequent of (a)?\n \n\n\nOne answer might be that one can\u2019t. Another might be that one can, and by asserting \u201cYou (do) want to get drunk every evening\u201d, but \nonly by deriving the consequent \u201cYou should work in a bar\u201d\nin a heavily qualified and contextualized sense: working in a bar\nmay fit getting drunk every evening as a necessary means;\nhence one might say \u201cYou should work in bar\u201d, but only if\nit is implicit that the fittingness that \u201cshould\u201d connotes\nexists only in relation to the goal in question. (So, of\ncourse, no recommendation of working in a bar follows.)\nHare, however, permits himself a bold solution. He takes the clause\n\u201cyou want to get drunk every evening\u201d to be have different\nmeanings in (a) and (b). In (b), it is an embedded indicative,\nascribing a desire to you\u2014which is why the consequent can be\ndetached by asserting \u201cYou want to get drunk every\nevening\u201d. In (a), it is an embedded imperative, which would\nserve on its own for advising you to get drunk every evening;\ntherefore the consequent can be detached, but only\nby prescribing \u201cGet drunk every evening\u201d.\n\n\nThe logic is then essentially the same as that of (E) above (but with a disambiguation of its second premise):\n\n\nGet drunk every evening.  To get drunk every evening, you must\nwork in a bar.  So, work in a bar.\n\n\n\nThis then invites rewriting, by what Hare takes to be an analogue of a licit logical manoeuvre, as\nfollows:\n\n\nTo get drunk every evening, you must work in a bar.  So, if get\ndrunk every evening, work in a bar.\n\n\n\nHowever, since grammar excludes following \u201cif\u201d by an\nimperative, it is replaced in the antecedent by a special use of\n\u201cyou want\u201d.\n\n\nThis might be thought no less problematic than convenient for Hare:\ndoesn\u2019t it break the simple\u2014if too simple\u2014rule that no\nimperative conclusion can be derived from premises that contain no\nimperative? However, that simple rule lacks application here; for the\noperator with widest scope in the conclusion is \u201cif\u201d, and\nnot an imperative.\n\n\nOf course, this proposal by Hare makes salient what has always been\nthe gravest objection to a prescriptivist analysis of practical\n\u201cought\u201ds (and \u201cmust\u201ds): moral judgments cannot\nentail imperatives; for the content of a moral judgment can occur,\nwhereas an imperative cannot occur, embedded in various\ncontexts, such as an \u201cif\u201d-clause (forming a conditional\nantecedent), or a \u201cthat\u201d-clause (giving the content of a\nbelief or assertion). The objection was made strongly by Peter Geach\nin an article (1965) citing Gottlob Frege; so it has come to be known\nas the \u201cFrege-Geach\u201d objection.  Hare\u2019s response is to be\nfound in Hare (1970). His solution to the problem as it arises with\nconditionals derives from Gilbert Ryle\u2019s notion of \u201cinference\ntickets\u201d (1950). The role of the quasi-English \u201cIf get\ndrunk every evening, work in a bar\u201d is to yield an implicit\nprescription to work in a bar out of any prescription to get drunk\nevery evening. To press the utterer of (a) on what he is\nhypothesizing, and what might make it true, is therefore out of\nplace. What looks like a truth-apt proposition with a complex\nstructure is really playing a quite different role: it is not a\nproposition, but a kind of rule.\n\n\nHare (1989c) further hoped to reduce the paradox of an embedded\nimperative by making a distinction between two elements within the\nexpression of a speech act: when a speaker says\n\u201cDo X\u201d, thereby telling a hearer to do X, he\nboth issues a sentence in the imperative mood, fit for the\ncommunication of a command, and indicates that he intends so to be\nusing it. He calls a sign of the first a tropic, or sign of\nmood; this is to be distinguished from a neustic, or sign of\nsubscription (like Frege\u2019s assertion-sign). When\n\u201cDo X\u201d is embedded within a conditional antecedent,\nas can be expressed in English by \u201cIf you want to\ndo X\u201d, the tropic remains though the neustic disappears.\nThis is why it is the imperative \u201cDo X\u201d, and not\nthe indicative \u201cYou are about to do X\u201d, that\nreleases the consequent.\n\n\nMany attempts have been made since to solve what is essentially the\nsame problem, which arises with any view of moral judgments that\ndenies that they are truth\u2013apt in the substantive sense of\ndescribing things, or presenting possible contents of belief about the\nway things are. Indeed, the topic has come fully to life again during\nthe past ten years or so. Of recent treatments, that which owes the\nmost to Hare, both actually and explicitly, is that of John Eriksson\n(2009); cf. also Eriksson (2015), and for discussion Eggers\n(2016). Take the following example (which is more straightforward than\nEriksson\u2019s):\n\nIt would be bad of you to lie to me.\nIf it would be bad of you to lie to me, it would be bad of me to\nlie to you. Therefore,\nIt would be bad of me to lie to you.\n\n\n\nWe may call the speaker \u201cS\u201d, and the addressee\n\u201cA\u201d. Eriksson\u2019s proposal is that the validity of\nthe reasoning depends upon the descriptive meaning of\n\u201cbad\u201d (one that it has in general, or, more likely, one\nthat it takes on in this context). Suppose that S\njudges A\u2019s lying to him to be bad. This must be because, in\nhis view, it has some general bad\u2013making characteristic (or set\nof characteristics) B*; this lies behind Premise 1. Then, in\na simple case (which should suffice for making the present point),\nwhat lies behind Premise 2. will be the equal but conditional\nascription of B* to A\u2019s lying to him. Premise\n1. becomes the antecedent that discharges the consequent of Premise\n2., and we have the conclusion stated in 3.\n\n\nHare was aware that such an inference goes through unproblematically\n(and uninterestingly) once we limit ourselves to the descriptive\nmeaning of \u201cbad\u201d that is spelled out in B*; but,\nof course, we want to have an inference to a prescriptive, and not\njust a descriptive, conclusion. Eriksson now draws on a point that is\nalready recurrent in Hare: in virtue of universalizability, S\nfaces a problem if he wishes to mean 1. prescriptively while refusing\nto mean 3. prescriptively. If he is to forbid A\u2019s lying to\nhim, but not his lying to A, he will need to identify some\nrelevant alternative to B* that fits A\u2019s lying to\nhim, but not his lying to A; this is where descriptive\nmeaning becomes crucial. What here defines \u201crelevance\u201d? A\nmere difference of identity between S and A is\nexcluded from counting as relevant by universalizability. Yet no\ndoubt S is also distinguishable from A by various\ngeneral features, and any of these might serve to make a permissible\ndistinction between the two cases. Here we need to appeal to the full\nforce of the Golden Rule Argument that we shall come to in the next\nsection: what is likely to exclude the speaker from making some\nartificial distinction that permits him to lie to A, but\nnot A to lie to him, will be his inability sincerely and\nprudently to select his prescriptions in accordance with it.\n \n\nThere can be no doubt that Hare would have welcomed this solution. Two\nobvious objections to it arise from problems that anyway attach to his\nconception of \u201cdescriptive meaning\u201d:\n\nS may have only a vague notion of the content of B*.\nEven if S has a clear (or sufficiently clear) notion of\nB*, A may well have a different notion himself,\nand/or no clear understanding of S\u2019s notion.\n\n\nEvidently, Hare needed to give further thought, within a philosophy of\nthought and language, to what must be a concept of speaker\u2019s\nmeaning. (At reading parties and in informal discussion, he took a\nkeen interest in the work of H.P. Grice; yet, perhaps out of an\nawareness of its complications, he never engaged with it in print, or\nin this connection.) A local reply, which keeps away from any such\ngeneral philosophy, must have to be on the lines of the\nfollowing. Evidently, it wasn\u2019t material to the validity of the\ninference as I presented it how we choose to\nspecify B*. Hence S and A can share a grasp\nof the validity of the inference even if they both lack, or fail to\nshare, any suitable conception of B*. All that Eriksson\noffers, and that I have presented, is a schematic grounding of the\ninference; and, for the reasons given, we can grasp, before we are\nable to spell out the details in a way that can reliably\nunderpin S and A\u2019s reasoning together to an ethical\nconclusion, how the schema confirms the validity of the inference. And\none real possibility that may ease the situation is this: S\nand A may agree that there is no relevant general\ncharacteristic that distinguishes S\u2019s lying to A\nfrom A\u2019s lying to S, though they disagree \u2013 or\nare each unclear \u2013 about what characteristic makes both\nwrong.\n\nDiscussion has focused upon the special problems that arise over\nembeddings within the antecedents of conditionals. With the occurrence\nof moral predicates within indirect speech Hare faced separate\ndifficulties, and ones to which he offers no explicit\nsolution. However, if there is to be any hope of a solution, he\nmay need, in this case, to exploit his notion of descriptive\nmeaning. Take as an example, \u201cS believes that lying is\nwrong\u201d, or alternatively (and indifferently) \u201cS\nholds lying to be wrong.\u201d A direct analysis of what he believes\nin believing this is hardly going to be available. Yet one may be able\nto specify, taking Hare\u2019s analysis of \u201cLying is wrong\u201d as\na hypothesis, what has to be true if S is to count as\nbelieving that lying is wrong. S needs to have a conception\nof some feature that characterizes lying in virtue of which, once he\nis prescribing universally, he forbids it. (Or else, S may be\nunable to say what it is about lying that makes it wrong to lie, yet\nwithout doubting that lying has some feature that does this.) What\nthen gives intelligibility and determinacy to the content of his\n\u201cbelief\u201d is not a set of truth-conditions, but an act of\nwill that rests upon a factual basis, and does not simply reiterate\nwhat his nanny has taught him to will. He holds what is\nstraightforwardly a factual belief about lying (though he may be\nvariably able to articulate it), and forbids lying in the light of\nthat.\n\n\n4. Decisions of Principle\n\n\nThe two features of prescriptivity and universalizability remained the\ntwin pillars of Hare\u2019s theory ever afterwards. The term\n\u201cuniversalisability\u201d was to become the title of a slightly\nlater paper (1954/5) which also sorted out a confusion that causes\nreal trouble in Aristotle and\nKant. \u201cGeneral\u201d terms (such as \u201cman\u201d\nor \u201cGreek\u201d) contrast with \u201csingular\u201d ones\n(such as \u201cSocrates\u201d). However, in the case\nof maxims, one needs to keep two distinctions apart: a maxim\nmay be \u201cuniversal\u201d, rather than \u201csingular\u201d or\n(ambiguously) \u201cparticular\u201d, in referring to no individuals\n(unless within the scope of a preposition such as \u201clike\u201d\nwhich converts the name of an individual into the vague specification\nof a kind); a maxim may also be \u201cgeneral\u201d, rather than\n\u201cspecific\u201d, in identifying a wide class of agent\nor act\u2014a difference that is one of degree (so that the universal\nrule \u201cAlways give true evidence\u201d is more specific than\n\u201cAlways tell the truth\u201d, and more general than\n\u201cAlways give true evidence on oath\u201d). Any discussion of\nthe practicality and acceptability of \u201cgeneral principles\u201d\nneeds to keep these distinctions apart. Hare\u2019s clarity on the matter\nis his most important non-disputable contribution to philosophy.\n\n\nIn his essay \u201cPractical Reason\u201d (1950), he had already\nargued that many decisions are decisions of principle not in deriving\nfrom a principle, but in establishing one. As he remarked there, \nIt is not easier, but more difficult, to decide to\naccept a very general command like \u201cNever tell lies\u201d than\nit is to decide not to tell this particular lie \u2026 If we cannot\ndecide even whether to tell this lie, we cannot, a fortiori,\ndecide whether to tell lies in innumerable circumstances whose details\nare totally unknown to us.\n What, then, is to guide decision? In the second part of his essay,\nhe attempted to find a secure basis for moral reasoning in such\nconcepts as \u201cfriend\u201d; but he discarded that approach\nbefore trying it out in print. His paper\n\u201cUniversalisability\u201d (1954/5) stressed one\u2019s personal\nresponsibility in making decisions that are also decisions of\nprinciple. The next important development came in a second\nbook, Freedom and Reason (1963), in which the formal features\nof prescriptivity and universalizability generate a \u201cGolden\nRule\u201d form of argument (as stated in Luke 6:31 (KJV), this ran,\n\u201cAnd as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them\nlikewise\u201d). Hare offers a simple scenario (1963: 90\u20131):\nsuppose that A owes money to B, who owes money\nto C, and that the law allows creditors to exact their debts by\nputting their debtors into prison. If B simply decides \u201cI\nwill put A into prison\u201d, there may be nothing to say to\nhim. But can he say \u201cI ought to put A into prison\u201d?\nIf he does, he commits himself to a principle such as \u201cIf this\nis the only way to exact the debt, the creditor should imprison the\ndebtor\u201d. B is unlikely to be willing to prescribe a\nlikely implication of this, \u201cLet C put me into\nprison\u201d, since that would frustrate his own interests. Hare\nargues that the form of argument retains its force even if, in\nfact, B is not himself a debtor; for the judgment \u201cI\nought to put A into prison\u201d, and the principle that it\ninvokes, will still entail conditionals, such as \u201cLet me be put\ninto prison if I am ever in A\u2019s situation\u201d, to\nwhich B is unlikely to be able honestly to subscribe.\n\n\nIn Freedom and Reason, Hare allows the argument to be evaded\nby the \u201cfanatic\u201d who is so committed to some impersonal\nideal (say that debtors deserve a hard time) that he is willing to\ndisregard his own personal interests (including the interests that he\nhas himself as a debtor, or would have if he were a debtor). A later\ntightening of the argument (first set out fully in 1972c), hoped to\nclose off this possibility. In their practical force, ideals are\nequivalent to universal preferences that differ from personal\npreferences in their content, but owe their moral weight to the\nprevalence and intensity of whatever preferences their realization\nwould satisfy. That B would really rather go to prison himself\nthan have debtors be treated leniently is possible, but improbable. A\nmore likely fanatic is guilty of a kind of imprudence in failing to\ngive due weight to his own interests, actual or counter-factual. The\nemergent ethical theory is a distinctive variety of utilitarianism,\none that identifies the moral good with the maximization not of some\nsubjective state such as happiness, but of the satisfaction of\npreferences.\n\n\nThe argument excited almost as much skepticism as attention. It seemed\nimplausible that the very activity of prescribing universally should\ncommit a speaker to a substantive ethical position, let alone one so\ndistinctive. However, the logic of Hare\u2019s position became perspicuous\nin his third book, Moral Thinking: Its Levels, Method, and\nPoint (1981). It is there set out as follows. In wondering\nwhether he should assent to the statement \u201cA ought\nto \u03c6\u201d, the speaker has to reflect whether he can\nprescribe that everyone should act in the same way, whatever his own\nsituation.  \u201cI\u201d connotes no essence (e.g., human): each of\nus might be anything, and so has, when prescribing for all\nsituations, actual or possible, to be concerned on behalf\nof everybody. There is further a prescriptive aspect to the\nmeaning of \u201cI\u201d: to take a role to be possibly one\u2019s\nown, and to prescribe for that possible situation, is to give\nweight to the preferences of the occupant of that role as if they were\nactually one\u2019s own. Hence, the speaker can rationally assent to a\nparticular \u201cought\u201d-statement only if it is derivable from\nsome universal principle that he will accept if he gives impartial and\npositive weight to all preferences whose satisfaction would be\naffected by its observance. Thus moral reflection generates a\nuniversalized prudence. Moral ideals register within this framework\nsimply as universal preferences; to allow one\u2019s own ideals to override\nmore intense or prevalent desires or ideals of others is a kind of\negoism, and so excluded. Human decision remains free, however rational\nand informed, because anyone can avoid the constraints of morality by\ndeclining to moralize; for this reason, it remains true that no\n\u201cis\u201d entails an \u201cought\u201d.\n\n\nThis is an extraordinary, and extraordinarily bold, intellectual\nconstruction, which invites debate at many points. Zeno Vendler (1988:\n181) urged that we keep apart the semantic thesis (which may be true\nor nearly true) that \u201cI\u201d is a pure indexical, from any\nmetaphysical claim (which may baffle us) that it denotes a pure\nsubject which can take on any state or role. In his reply,\nHare clearly shies away from adopting a metaphysical position stranger\nthan Vendler\u2019s own (which rejects Cartesian egos but does admit a\ntranscendental ego). Yet he still supposes it to be true that \u201cI\nmight be Napoleon\u201d, and that \u201cthe world in which I was\nNapoleon would be a different world than this, though not in its\nuniversal properties\u201d (1988a: 285). He even supposes that I can\nconsider situations in which I am a stove, a mountain, or a\ntree\u2014although, since I cannot care what happens to me if I\nbecome such a thing, the consideration is\nidle (1988a:\n283). Hare seems here to have entered rather unexpected territory. It\nwould have suited his usual common sense to permit me to imagine\nnot that I am Napoleon, but being Napoleon, i.e.,\nwhat it was like to be Napoleon; and that can suffice to incline one\nto ambivalence about the outcome of Waterloo. But he requires there to\nbe a possible situation in which I am, at any rate,\nrelevantly just like Napoleon if he is to maintain that\nprescribing, say, \u201cAll men like Napoleon should receive their\ncome-uppance\u201d applies even to oneself, and so may be\nimprudent.\n\n\nA danger remained of deriving a kind of imperative from an\nindicative. No doubt Napoleon very much wanted to win the battle. Does\nawareness of that fact commit me to prescribing, on the\ncounter-factual supposition that I am Napoleon, that Napoleon be\nvictorious? Here Hare makes further use of his thesis that the meaning\nof \u201cI\u201d is partly prescriptive: to hypothesize \u201cif I\nwere Napoleon\u201d is already to \u201cidentify with his\nprescriptions\u201d, in the sense of prescribing that, other things\nbeing equal, they be satisfied within the scope of the hypothesis\n(1981: 96\u20139). \n\n\nThe solution is equally elegant and audacious. It may confirm doubts\nwhether the situation of my being Napoleon is a situation at\nall. (For if it were a possible situation, of the\nsame kind as an actual situation, how could I\nbe logically\u2014as opposed to humanly\u2014constrained in\nwhat attitude I adopted towards it?) It also throws open questions\nabout what identifying with Napoleon\u2019s prescriptions comes to. One\nmight think that, if \u201cI\u201d is fully prescriptive, I\ncannot prescribe that Napoleon be defeated in the situation in which I\nam Napoleon, since that is certainly not what he wanted or would ever\nhave wanted; if so, I cannot honestly prescribe that all men like\nNapoleon be defeated, since, for one case (that in which I am\nNapoleon), I do not want that. What Hare requires is a weaker\nidentification: given that I am moralizing, and hence prescribing for\nall situations of a given general kind, I must give some\nweight to the preferences that are mine in the situation in which I am\nNapoleon, but not more weight than that which I give to the preferences\nthat are mine in any of the other situations; hence, in deciding what\nto prescribe universally, I must weigh all relevant preferences\nequally (relative to their prevalence and intensity). This is exactly\nwhere Hare intends to lead us; but he invites the question how he can\nprove that one is taken that way by the logic of\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cI\u201d.\n5. Attending to Preferences\n\n\nA related query (which Moral Thinking leaves as\n\u201cunfinished business\u201d; 1981: 105, cf. 1997) arises about\nthe range of preferences that prescribing universally commits one to\ntaking on board. If \u201cI\u201d is fully prescriptive, it may\nfurther follow that to suppose that I am some person is to take on\nboard all his preferences, including \u201cexternal\u201d\nones about matters (say his neighbors\u2019 sexual or dietary\npractices) that may never impinge upon his consciousness. Yet\nsometimes Hare only demands impartiality between interests, which is\nnarrower. To accommodate precisely that, we might distinguish a\nsympathetic \u201cI\u201d: to suppose that I am some person might be\nto give full weight to his preferences regarding his own\nexperiences. This would still leave open whether I should take into\naccount his prudential preferences (now-for-then) for his future, or\nonly his synchronic preferences (now-for-now) regarding his present\nstate. Alternatively, we might admit an egocentric \u201cI\u201d:\nthis would let us give weight to Cheops\u2019 desire that he\nreceive a big funeral after his death, but not to external desires\nthat do not essentially refer to their possessor. Yet such options\nembarrass if the aim was to derive a precise ethical theory from the\nvery logic of the concepts.\n\n\nAs Hare notes (1981: 103), restrictions upon the relevant range of\npreferences may have the effect of bringing together a utilitarianism\nthat aims to maximize pleasure or happiness, and one that aims to\nmaximize the satisfaction of preference. Yet to have any hope of\nachieving this we would need a double restriction: the only\npreferences to be considered must be now-for-now or then-for-then, and\nthey must be fully internal in relating only to conscious states of\nthe subject\u2014indeed, more precisely, to features of those states\nof which the agent is conscious, or, for short, what it is\nlike to be in those states. However, this position is doubly\ninsecure. First, when discussing the treatment of now-for-then\npreferences, Hare takes over from Richard Brandt the idea that\nrational agents seek to maximize the satisfaction of their present\npreferences after they have been adjusted in the light of full\nexposure to logic and the facts (1981: 101\u20135,\n214\u201316). This makes the practical question for the agent not\n\u201cWhat do I now prefer?\u201d, but \u201cWhat would I prefer\nafter full exposure to logic and the facts?\u201d The same issue\narises even with now-for-now preferences. Hare discusses, though in a\ndifferent context (1981: 142\u20134), the pleasure machine imagined\nby J.J.C. Smart (Smart & Williams 1983: 18) that maximizes the\npleasures of a subject through generating a stream of illusory but\nenjoyable experiences. He sees it as an advantage of his variety of\nutilitarianism that, not being \u201cformulated in terms of\npleasure\u201d, it can give weight to whether\n\u201cwe prefer a life for ourselves plugged into the\nmachines to one devoted to pursuits now considered normal and\nenjoyable\u201d (1981: 143). That suggests that we should give weight\nto now-for-now preferences whose objects are not restricted\nto conscious features of current mental states. Further, if we follow\nBrandt, we should ask not what now-for-now preferences an\nagent actually has, but which he would have after\nsubjection to Brandt\u2019s \u201ccognitive psycho-therapy\u201d. Yet\nthis implication may trouble us, not only because of the indefinite\nscope it offers to paternalism, but because it would seem\nundeterminable what an agent would want if indefinitely\ninformed.\n\n\nThe other source of insecurity is doubts about whether, within Hare\u2019s\nframework, we are justified in restricting the relevant range of\npreferences. If, in deciding what ought to be done, I am rationally\nbound to identify with the agents whose preferences, internal or\nexternal, bear on it, how can I fail to take on the widest range of\nactual preferences, now-for-then as well as now-for-now and\nthen-for-then, external as well as internal, and uninformed as well as\ninformed? Hare inclines this way, writing \u201cIt is still my belief\nthat a full account of the matter would assign weight to all\npreferences\u201d (1981: 103\u20134). However, how might this best\nbe done? Let us take them in turn.\n\nNow-for-then preferences.  Hare is clear that we take\ninto account how much an agent prefers one thing to another,\nalso to how many agents prefer it. This suggests that we\nshould also attend to how long an agent has a preference; for\nit would seem arbitrary to count a preference twice if two men have\nit, if only for a day, but only once if one man has it for two\ndays. We might assimilate the questions how long and how\nmany by dividing people into time-slices within which their\nrelevant preferences are stable, and asking how many\nperson-slices shared some given preference. Yet the effect is\ncurious. Within the life of an individual, a preference may become\noverriding because he has entertained it for a long time, even if it\nhas been replaced by conflicting preferences at the time of\naction. (And the theory would not allow one to give precedence to the\npreferences of the person-slice who acts on the grounds of agential\nautonomy; for agents enjoy no such privilege.)\nExternal preferences. One difficulty here is in assessing\nthe intensity of an external preference that is idle, but perhaps\nbecause the agent can do nothing towards satisfying it.  Apparent\nintensity may be deceptive: it is the mark of a sentimental attitude\nthat it may be warmly felt, and yet at the same time inactive and\ninsincere. However, the same problem arises elsewhere; it is not\npeculiar to external preferences.\nUninformed preferences. It is hard to see how Hare\u2019s\nframework itself justifies disregarding these. However, subjects may\nhave a higher-level preference that, where they hold or lack a\nlower-level preference only out of ignorance, its presence or absence\nshould be discounted\u2014thought perhaps only so long as this does\nnot give rise to a denial of autonomy within spheres where each of us\nexpects to be free to act at will according to his own judgment.\n\n\n\nThere is further unclarity in the notion of a preference.\nHare had long distinguished being in pain, to which one may\nbe indifferent (if the pain is slight, or if one has undergone\nprefrontal lobotomy), and suffering, which entails having a\ndesire (not necessarily overriding) to escape it. Now it is plausible\nto suppose that, of any variety of suffering, there is such a thing\nas what it is like to be subject to it. (So Hare can write of\na group of sufferers, \u201cI shall not know what it will be like for\nthem \u2026 unless I know what it is like to suffer like\nthat\u201d; 1981: 92.) This applies so long as the desire that is an\naspect of suffering is of a kind that is bound to be felt.\nYet we all are subject to an indefinite range of desires that are\ndispositional; and even occurrent desires may be manifest in how we\nthink or act without being felt. Hare appears to overlook such\nvariations when he writes of preferences in general, \u201cIf I do\nnot feel the preference with the intensity which the person in the\nsituation feels it, I have not fully represented his situation to\nmyself\u201d (Seanor & Fotion 1988: 288). And yet, when he\nconsiders failures to act as one prescribes (e.g., 1981: 21\u20132),\nhe shows an awareness that how one chooses and acts can be equally\nindicative as anything one feels of what one prefers. No doubt this\ncould be sorted out, and precisely by recognizing (as Hare doubtless\ncould have, though the language is not his) that the criteria\nof preference are multiple. However, this would have for him two\ndrawbacks. First, it multiplies the possible ways in which one might\ncount as \u201cidentifying with\u201d another. Hare has written,\n\u201cIn identifying myself with some person either actually or\nhypothetically, I identify with his prescriptions\u201d (1981:\n96\u20137). Yet another way might be imagining what it is like to be\nhim at some time or in some situation\u2014which is different, though\nit may (to the extent that his preferences come to his mind as objects\nof attention) be overlapping.  Secondly, it confirms a doubt that one\nis likely to have anyway about the comparability of preferences. If I\nfeel like doing something but, for no compelling reason, fail to do\nit, whereas you do it without any prior or accompanying consciousness\nof the preference, who has the stronger preference to do it? The\nquestion is liable to be unanswerable.\n6. Possible People\n\n\nOutside Moral Thinking itself, a striking application of\nHare\u2019s framework was to possible people, that is, to people who may\nexist, with preferences and interests to be satisfied, if we choose to\nbring them into existence. Ought we to do so, so long as this will\nincrease the total satisfaction of preference? A positive answer has\nimplications\u2014though not, Hare argued, very radical\nones\u2014for population policy, and the morality of such practices\nas abortion and IVF. Hare reasons that, if I am glad that I exist, I\ntenselessly prescribe, ceteris paribus, that my parents bring\nme into existence; universalizing the prescription, I must\nprescribe, ceteris paribus, the bringing into existence of\nothers relevantly like me (1975, 1988b, 1988c).\n\n\nThis is intriguing, though not unproblematic. We may be struck by its\ninvocation, in effect, of past imperatives (such as Gerald Manley\nHopkins\u2019s \u201cHave fair fallen, O fair, fair have\nfallen\u201d, addressed to Henry Purcell, which Hopkins explained, in\na letter to Bridges on Feb. 3 1883, as \u2018the singular imperative\n(or optative if you like) of the past, a thing possible and actual\nboth in logic and grammar, but naturally a rare one\u2019). Not that\nthis is new: Hare had had already to defend them in prescriptivist\nanalysis of \u201cI ought to have done that\u201d. A further\nquestion is whether Hare has correctly isolated the initial\nattitude. If what I am glad of is the kind of life I experience, in\npreference to there simply being less life of this kind in the world\n(cf. 1988c: 173\u20134), then, if universalization generates a\ngolden-rule argument, it should indeed lead me to\nprescribe, ceteris paribus, creating other similar lives\n(unless it is the uniqueness of the life that I value).  But Hare also\nsupposes that what Jane Doe is grateful for is that she, Jane\nDoe, exist and not someone else, even equally privileged, in her place\n(1988b: 87\u20138). Yet it is less clear that we can expect her to\nhave that attitude, let alone its analogue, within Hare\u2019s\nframework, of being specially glad that Dick Hare (or someone with all\nhis universal qualities) exists\u2014supposing that he is glad to\nexist\u2014in that possible world in which she is (or has all the\nuniversal qualities of) Dick Hare.\n7. Levels of Moral Thinking\n\n\nA different feature of his theory, first presented (in different\nterminology) in \u201cEthical Theory and Utilitarianism\u201d\n(1976), and fully explored in Moral Thinking (1981), is a\ndistinction between a \u201ccritical\u201d level of thinking,\nconducted by \u201carchangels\u201d with the use of \u201cGolden\nRule\u201d arguments, and an \u201cintuitive\u201d level, conducted\nby \u201cproles\u201d with the use of simple principles (often\narticulating emotional responses) whose acceptance can be justified at\nthe critical level. These two levels define not two social castes, but\ntwo roles between which each of us learns to alternate as appropriate.\nThe complication is actually inevitable within consequentialism, which\nhas to separate the question how one should act from the\nquestion how one should think about how to act\u2014for ways\nof thinking have consequences no less than ways of acting (and\nthinking that one should act in a certain way entails no success in so\nacting, nor even any attempt). A utilitarian assessment of practical\nprinciples has to consider not only their observance utility\n(OU), which is what good will come of enacting them, but also\ntheir acceptance utility (AU), which is (roughly) what good\nwill come of intending to enact them. (Note that intending to act in a\ncertain way is itself a mental act. There is no ground here\nto shift to a different form of utilitarianism,\n\u201crule\u201d rather than \u201cact\u201d, or\n\u201cindirect\u201d rather than \u201cdirect\u201d; rather, so\nfar we are simply extending act-utilitarianism to a wider range of\nacts, mental as well as physical.) A broad generalization that Hare\nfavored is that the highest OU is likely to attach to highly specific\nprinciples, though a higher AU may attach to some fairly general ones.\nThis comes of human ignorance and self-deception. A principle, say,\npermitting adultery when a marriage is breaking up anyway might have a\nhigher OU than one simply forbidding adultery; but, if there are\npotential Don Juan\u2019s around with a talent for false rationalization,\nits AU may be lower.\n\n\nThis complication was both convenient, and problematic. Hare had long\nbeen wearied by familiar objections citing concrete cases where\nutilitarian theory appears to conflict with moral intuition, as when\nan American sheriff might judicially execute one suspect in order to\nprevent a mass lynching of others. He could now hope to accommodate\nthese at the \u201cintuitive\u201d level of thinking. An inability\never to countenance judicial murder may be recommendable by\ncritical to intuitive thinking as a constraint upon practical\nreflection in an emergency. And given that the attitude is approved,\nif not reasserted, by critical thinking as Hare conceives it, how can\nit in itself tell against his conception of critical thinking? (It\nwould be a case, so to speak, of biting the hand that fed one.)\n\n\nHowever, there is a difficulty. It is one thing to make do\nwith intuitive ways of solving problems that are the best available\nwithin limits of time and information, while leaving them subject to\ncorrection at leisure or in retrospect; it is another to accept a\ntheory that approves one\u2019s actually assenting to certain\nprinciples whose contents it cannot endorse. And yet a rule that is a\nmere \u201crule of thumb\u201d is a paper shield against temptation.\nAll is well if the theory can be self-effacing, so that the agent\ndiscards it as and when he adopts an intuitive viewpoint; but, in\nHare\u2019s scenario, in which the agent has internalized both critical and\nintuitive ways of thinking, how is he to keep out of mind, as he tests\nhis practical commitment to some intuitive principle, that it is\nsimply not of a kind (being absolute, and yet evidently equivalent to\nno principle of utility) to be critically endorsable?\n\n\nThis objection was to be raised both by Williams (1988) and by J.L.\nMackie (1985: 110\u201311) (cf. also, though not explicitly about\nHare, Hunt 1999: \u00a75). Hare anticipated it as follows:\nTo say that it is impossible to keep critical and intuitive\nthinking going in the same thought-process is like saying that in a\nbattle a commander cannot at the same time be thinking of the details\nof tactics, the overall aim of victory, and the principles (economy of\nforce, concentration of force, offensive action, etc.) which he has\nlearnt when learning his trade. (1981: 52; cf. 1988a:\n289\u201390)\nThis is evidently true of what he had called\n\u201crules of thumb\u201d, which an agent applies just so long as\nthis remains the best way in context of achieving his goals. However,\nHare came to deprecate that phrase (1981: 38), and to emphasize that\nthe \u201cprima facie principles\u201d he prefers to speak of have\nthe power to produce compunction even where their neglect,\nsince well grounded, cannot produce remorse (1981: 30). Yet\nhow is this to work? No doubt it is possible to combine being\nconvinced both that one has to do X in some difficult situation\n(say when only lying will save my father), and that doing X\nremains in some significant way bad. Yet this thought\nrequires the possession of a distinctive concept of being bad\nwhose application, on occasion, though lacking the power to determine\nan ethical decision, remains obstinately significant and\ninexpungible. Without such a concept, talk of\n\u201ccompunction\u201d is out of place. Hare makes room for this\nwhen he concedes that moral concepts may suffer a sea-change when they\nare applied at the intuitive and non-critical level. The only\nparticular proposal he makes is that \u201cought\u201d becomes\noverridable; yet he should surely be willing to concede that quite new\nconcepts may come into being\u2014all, of course, under the arching\nguidance of critical thinking. And one such concept might be expressed\nby a use of \u201cmorally bad\u201d of a kind associated with moral\nphilosophies that Hare would otherwise reject.\n\n\nHowever, it must remain a problem that, precisely to the extent that\nintuitive thinking can draw upon conceptions of its own, a clear-eyed\nintuitive thinking that does not occlude the judgments of critical\nthinking must be as problematic for Hare as a clear-eyed acrasia that\nunites conscious and voluntary infringement of a prescription with\ncontinued acceptance of it. Force still attaches to an objection by\nWilliams (1988: 190):\n\n\nThe theory ignores the fact that the responses are not merely a\nblack-box mechanism to generate what is probably the best outcome\nunder confusing conditions. Rather, they constitute a way of seeing\nthe situation; and you cannot combine seeing the situation in that\nway, from the point of view of those dispositions, with seeing it\nin the archangel\u2019s way, in which all that is important is maximum\npreference satisfaction, and the dispositions themselves are merely a\nmeans to that.\n8. Traces of Positivism in Religion and Metaethics\n\n\nHare did not suppose that the modern thinking man could long remain\nwhat he called a \u201csimple believer\u201d; so he welcomed\nattempts by R.B. Braithwaite and others to empty religion of dogmatic\ncontent.  He called himself a \u201cChristian empiricist\u201d, but\nthought the question whether he was really a Christian\nterminological.  What he retained for himself was what he once called\na \u201cblik\u201d, an attitude to the world which somehow gave him\nconfidence to live and think morally, trusting (as he put it)\n\u201cin my own continued well-being (in some sense of that world\nthat I may not now fully understand) if I continue to do what is right\naccording to my lights\u201d, as also \u201cin the general\nlikelihood of people like Hitler coming to a bad end\u201d (1950/1:\n38). John Hare (2002: 307) connects the inhibitions that held his\nfather back from belief not just with modern skepticism, but with\n\u201ca philosophical doctrine about meaning which he inherited from\nCarnap and the logical positivists\u201d; for \u201cHe thought he\ncould not make meaningful assertions about subjects, like God, which\nlay beyond the limits of possible sense experience\u201d. Thus he\ndenied that the transcendental has anything to do with prayer, asking\n\u201cWhat is the difference between there being a transcendental God\nwho listens to the prayer and directs events accordingly, and it just\nbeing the case that the events take place?\u201d, and answering\n\u201cNone at all\u201d (1973: 27). The upshot is fatal to the\northodoxies of belief as of unbelief:\nWhere the transcendental is concerned, there is no\ndifference between a true story and a myth; it is therefore wrong to\nspeak of the person who prays having an illusion that there\nis somebody that he is praying to. (ibid.)\nSimple belief, it turns out, lacks even a content.\n\nAlso traceable to positivism was a recurrent tendency to doubt the\nsubstantiality of philosophical disagreement. Presumably Plato was\nmaking a mistake of a kind when, as Hare diagnosed it, he\ninterpreted the experience which we call\n\u201chaving a particular mental image of a square\u201d as\n\u201chaving, on a particular occasion, a mental look at the\nSquare\u201d. (1964: 67)\nWithin meta-ethics, however, Hare was inclined to suppose that such\nvariations fail to be more than verbal. This suspicion was first\nexpressed in an unpublished paper \u201cMoral Objectivity\u201d\n(1949\u201350). Here Hare imagines a White (an objectivist) who calls\n\u201ca moral intuition\u201d what a Black (a subjectivist) calls\n\u201ca feeling of approval\u201d, and wonders about the point at\nissue:\nNow we may well ask, seeing that we are all agreed\nthat there is this experience, no matter what you call it,\nwhat on earth is the point of having long philosophical arguments\nabout what you do call it.\nTake a case of disagreement about pacifism:\nThe Whites describe this situation by saying that\nthere is a difference of opinion between us as to whether fighting\ndoes or does not possess the quality right; the Blacks, on the other\nhand, describe it by saying that we have different feelings about\nfighting. But the situation which they are both trying to describe is\nprecisely the same, and they know it \u2026 They are disagreeing\nmerely about words.\nHare pursued this skepticism in two published\npapers, \u201cNothing Matters\u201d (1959), and \u201cOntology in\nEthics\u201d (1985). Here he suspects of vacuity certain terms that\nget overworked, \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfact\u201d,\n\u201cworld\u201d, \u201cobjective\u201d, \u201crealist\u201d,\n\u201ccognitivist\u201d; hence he thinks it much harder than many\nhave done to define a position that is distinctively objectivist. (It\nis certainly not enough to reassert \u201cMurder is wrong\u201d in a\npeculiar and, as it were, metaethical tone of voice, firm and yet\nunemotive.) What I have traced back to a verificationism that may now\nseem dated becomes well-grounded when applied to abstractions that, as\nappropriated by philosophers, await a clear sense.\n9. Afterword\n\n\nHare\u2019s unpublished paper \u201cMoral Objectivity\u201d contains a\nstriking passage, unparalleled elsewhere, that confirms Lucas\u2019s\nsupposition (2002: 31) of a connection between his war experience and\na vein of existentialism. He imagines being an interpreter in a\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camp who is trying to persuade the Japanese\ncommander not to send sick people out to work on the railway:\n\nI ask him to visualise, not certain non-natural properties, but the\nvery natural, real properties of the situations that the alternative\ncourses of action will bring about \u2026 It is not by any appeal to\nintuition that I can conduct my argument; \u2026 it is by revealing\nto him the nature of his choice, and showing him what it involves,\nwhat in fact he is choosing. And when I have done all this, I can only\nleave him to choose; for it is after all his choice, not mine \u2026\nAt any rate I have myself chosen, so far as in me lies, my own way of\nlife, my own standard of values, my own principle of choice. In the\nend we all have to choose for ourselves; and no one can do it for\nanyone else.\n\n\nWhat makes Hare arguably unique, though at the same time closer in\napproach to Kant than to the utilitarians whose ally he became, was\nthat he combined this insistence upon the ineluctability of individual\nchoice with an optimistic view of the possibilities of making choices\nrationally. (Indeed, he played with the idea that Kant could have been\na utilitarian, 1993b.) What reconciles these two features of moral\nthinking, in his view, is nothing other than the logic of the\npractical \u201cought\u201d. That this is crucial and central was\nalready a claim within his early and unpublished monograph \u201cAn\nEssay in Monism\u201d. There, criticizing \u201cmaterialists\u201d\n(among whom he counts utilitarians) for letting \u201cthe word\n\u2018ought\u2019 slip out of their vocabulary\u201d, he remarks,\nBoth the Greeks of the Fourth Century B.C. and we\nin our own times have seen how quickly people like Thrasymachus spring\nup, and with what dire results, once men have forgotten the meaning of\n\u201cought\u201d. (ch. 19, p. 62)\n\n\nThis may already seem curious in two ways. First, one might suppose\nthat language is rather our servant than our master, and that the\nrationality of reasoning in the ways he recommends needs to be\nestablished on general grounds, and not made to depend upon theses\nabout the connotations of a word. Secondly, one of the theses in\nquestion\u2014that practical \u201cought\u201ds entail\nimperatives\u2014is hardly obviously true; one might rather expect an\nOxford philosopher, in the heyday of ordinary language philosophy, to\nbe sensitive to the objection that the modal \u201cYou ought to\ndo X\u201d no more entails the imperative\n\u201cDo X\u201d than the modal \u201cHe ought to have got\nhome by now\u201d entails the indicative \u201cHe has got home by\nnow\u201d. (Think how much more plausible it is to infer the second\nfrom \u201cHe must have got home by now\u201d.)\n\n\nHare had replies to both objections, which he sets out briefly\nin Moral Thinking (1981). He insists that we need our words\nto mean what they do mean if we are to answer the questions that we\nwant to ask:\nIf we were to alter the meaning of our words, we\nshould be altering the questions we were asking, and perhaps\nanswering, in terms of them \u2026 If we go trying to\nanswer those questions, we are stuck with those\nconcepts. (1981: 18)\nAnd yet, at the same time, he asserts no more\nthan that the practical \u201cought\u201d is a \u201cnear\nneighbour\u201d to the deontic \u201cmust\u201d (1981: 7),\nacknowledging\nIt is much odder to say \u201cI must\u201d at\nthe moment at which one is backsliding (i.e. doing what one says one\nmust not do) than it is to do this with \u201cought\u201d.  (1981:\n24)\nHere he may seem to vacillate between two different roles, that of\ndescribing our language as it is, and that of tightening it in order\nto make it more rigorous. Perhaps one may reconcile these through\nmaking much of the following qualification:\nBut \u201cought\u201d aspires to the status of\n\u201cmust\u201d, and \u2026 in rigorous, critical moral reasoning\nhas to be used like it. (1981: 24)\nIn Hare\u2019s view, it is human weakness that is\nserved better by \u201cought\u201d than by \u201cmust\u201d, and\nwe reveal our commitment to the logic of \u201cmust\u201d in uses of\n\u201cought\u201d that fall short of that logic, and yet constantly\naspire to live up to it.  \u201cIntuitive\u201d thinking may be as\nnecessary as \u201ccritical\u201d, and yet it is never such as to\nenjoy a secure resting-place in our hearts and minds.\n\n\nAt the heart of Hare\u2019s ethical theory, therefore, lies a vision of\nhuman beings as unable to live up to a way of thinking towards which\nthey are nonetheless ineluctably drawn. He perceives there to be a\ndrama inherent in the human condition to which no fully integrated and\nunified system could do justice. His philosophy is currently somewhat\nout of fashion, in part through a reversion to various forms of\ncognitivism in ethics, in part through changes in the style of\nphilosophy, which now pursues the clarity that he desired through a\nnew complexity and professionalization. At least in the short term, it\nis probable, and in accord with the \u201cstrange dream\u201d from\nwhich we started, that his thinking will come to be viewed from a\ndistance, as playing a once important role within the non-cognitivist\nstrain in ethics that was dominant through much of the 20th\ncentury. And yet it may yet come to hold the attention of a new\naudience through its recognition of the tensions inherent in any\npractical thinking that responds without complacency to the\naspirations of our ethical ideals, and the limitations of our moral\ncapacities.\n\n\n Supplementary Document:\n Hare\u2019s \u201cAn Essay on Monism\u201d\n\n\n",
