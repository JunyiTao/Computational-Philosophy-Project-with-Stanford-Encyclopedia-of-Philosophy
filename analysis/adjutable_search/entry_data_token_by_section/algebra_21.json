The term algebra determined by\nthe binary operation symbol and the constant symbol for identity can\nbe viewed as binary trees with variables and copies of the constant\nsymbol at the leaves. Identifying trees according to associativity has\nthe effect of flattening the trees into words that ignore the order in\nwhich the operation was applied (without however reversing the order\nof any arguments). This produces words over the alphabet \\(X\\)\ntogether with the identity. The identity laws then erase the\nidentities, except in the case of a word consisting only of the\nidentity symbol, which we take to be the empty word.\n\nThus the monoid of finite words over an alphabet \\(X\\) is the free\nmonoid on \\(X\\).\n\nAnother representation of the free monoid on \\(n\\) generators is as an\ninfinite tree, every vertex of which has \\(n\\) descendants, one for\neach letter of the alphabet, with each edge labeled by the\ncorresponding letter. Each vertex \\(v\\) represents the word consisting\nof the letters encountered along the path from the root to \\(v\\). The\nconcatenation of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) is the vertex arrived at by taking\nthe subtree whose root is the vertex \\(u\\), noticing that this tree is\nisomorphic to the full tree, and locating \\(v\\) in this subtree as\nthough it were the full tree.\n\nIf we ignore the direction and labels of the edges in this tree we can\nstill identify the root: it is the only vertex with \\(n\\) edges\nincident on it, all other vertices have \\(n+1\\), namely the one\nincoming edge and the \\(n\\) outgoing ones.\n\nThe free commutative monoid on a set is that monoid whose\ngenerators behave like letters just as for free monoids (in particular\nthey are still atoms), but which satisfy the additional law \\(uv =\nvu\\). We make further identifications, e.g. of\n\u201cdog\u201d and \u201cdgo\u201d. Order of letters in a word is\nnow immaterial, all that matters is how many copies there are of each\nletter. This information can be represented as an \\(n\\)-tuple of\nnatural numbers where \\(n\\) is the size of the alphabet. Thus the free\ncommutative monoid on \\(n\\) generators is \\(N^n\\), the algebra of\n\\(n\\)-tuples of natural numbers under addition.\n\nIt can also be obtained from the tree representation of the free\nmonoid by identifying vertices. Consider the case \\(n = 2\\) of two\nletters. Since the identifications do not change word length, all\nidentifications are of vertices at the same depth from the root. We\nperform all identifications simultaneously as follows. At every vertex\n\\(v\\), identify \\(v_{01}\\) and \\(v_{10}\\) and their subtrees. Whereas\nbefore there were \\(2^n\\) vertices at depth \\(n\\), now there are\n\\(n+1\\). Furthermore instead of a tree we have the upper right\nquadrant of the plane, that is, \\(N^2\\), rotated 135 degrees\nclockwise, with every vertex \\(v\\) at the top of a diamond whose other\nvertices are \\(v_0\\) and \\(v_1\\) at the next level down, and the\nidentified pair \\(v_{01} = v_{10}\\) below both.\n\nTo form the free group on \\(n\\) generators, first form the free monoid\non \\(2n\\) generators, with generators organized into complementary\npairs each the inverse of the other, and then delete all adjacent\ncomplementary pairs from all words.\n\nThis view is not particularly insightful. The group counterpart of the\ntree representation does a better job of presenting a free group.\nConsider the free group on \\(n = 2\\) generators \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We\nstart with the free monoid on 4 generators \\(A, B, a, b\\) where \\(a\\)\nis the inverse of \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) that of \\(B\\). Every vertex of this\ntree has 4 descendants. So the root has degree 4 and the remaining\nvertices have degree 5: every vertex except the root has one edge\ngoing in, say the generator \\(a\\), and four out. Consider any nonroot\nvertex \\(v\\). The effect of deleting adjacent complementary pairs is\nto identify the immediate ancestor of \\(v\\) with one of the four\ndescendants of \\(v\\), namely the one that makes the path from the\nancestor to the descendant a complementary pair. For every nonroot\nvertex \\(v\\) these identifications reduce the degree of \\(v\\) from 5\nto 4. The root remains at degree 4.\n\nSo now we have an infinite graph every vertex of which has degree 4.\nUnlike the tree for the free monoid on 2 generators, where the root is\ntopologically different from the other vertices, the tree for the free\ngroup on 2 generators is entirely homogeneous. Thus if we throw away\nthe vertex labels and rely only on the edge labels to navigate, any\nvertex can be taken as the identity of the group.\n\nThis homogeneity remains the case for the free abelian group on 2\ngenerators, whose vertices are still of degree 4. However the\nadditional identifications turns it from a tree (a graph with no\ncycles) to a grid whose vertices are the lattice points of the plane.\nThat is, the free abelian group on 2 generators is \\(Z^2\\), and on\n\\(n\\) generators \\(Z^n\\). The edges are the line segments joining\nadjacent lattice points.\n",
