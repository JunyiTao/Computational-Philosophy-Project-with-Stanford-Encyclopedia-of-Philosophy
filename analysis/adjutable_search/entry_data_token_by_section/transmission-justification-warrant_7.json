    "main_text": "Applications || Moorean Proofs, Perceptual Justification and Religious Justification\n4.2 McKinsey\u2019s Paradox\n\nMcKinsey (1991, 2002, 2003, 2007) has offered a reductio argument for\nthe incompatibility of first-person privileged access to mental\ncontent and externalism about mental content. The privileged access\nthesis roughly says that it is necessarily true that if \\(s\\) is\nthinking that \\(x\\), then \\(s\\) can in principle know a\npriori (or in a non-empirical way) that she is thinking that\n\\(x\\). Externalism about mental content roughly says that predicates\nof the form \u2018is thinking that \\(x\\)\u2019\u2014e.g., \u2018is\nthinking that water is wet\u2019\u2014express properties that are\nwide, in the sense that possession of these properties by\n\\(s\\) logically or conceptually implies the existence of relevant\ncontingent objects external to \\(s\\)\u2019s mind\u2014e.g., water.\nMcKinsey argues that \\(s\\) may reason along these lines:\n\nWater\n\n\\(\\rP_{10}\\).\n I am thinking that water is wet.\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\).\n If I am thinking that water is wet, then I have (or my linguistic\ncommunity has) been embedded in an environment that contains\nwater.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_{10}\\).\n I have (or my linguistic community has) been embedded in an\nenvironment that contains water.\n\n\n\nWater produces an absurdity. If the privileged access thesis\nis true, \\(s\\) knows\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\nnon-empirically. If semantic externalism is true, \\(s\\)\nknows\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\na priori by conceptual analysis. Since \\(\\rP_{10}\\) and\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\) do entail\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\n and knowledge is presumably closed under known entailment, \\(s\\)\nknows \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\u2014which is an empirical\nproposition\u2014by simply competently deducing it from \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\nand \\(\\rP_{11}\\) and without conducting any empirical\ninvestigation. Since this is absurd, McKinsey concludes that the\nprivileged access thesis or semantic externalism must be false.\n\nOne way to resist McKinsey\u2019s incompatibilist conclusion\nthat the privileged access thesis and externalism about mental content\ncannot be true together is to argue that\n Water\n is non-transmissive. Since knowledge is presumably closed under known\nentailment, it remains true that \\(s\\) cannot know\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n and\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\n while failing to know\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\).\n However, McKinsey\u2019s paradox originates from the stronger\nconclusion\u2014motivated by the claim that Water is a\ndeductively valid argument featuring premises knowable\nnon-empirically\u2014that \\(s\\), by running Water, could\nknow non-empirically the empirical proposition\n\\(\\rQ_{10}\\) that she or members of her community have had contact\nwith water. This is precisely what could not happen if Water\nis non-transmissive: in this case \\(s\\) couldn\u2019t learn\n\\(\\rQ_{10}\\) on the basis of her non-empirical justification for\n\\(\\rP_{10}\\) and \\(\\rP_{11}\\), and her knowledge of the entailment\nbetween \\(\\rP_{10}\\), \\(\\rP_{11}\\), and \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) (see mainly\nWright 2000, 2003,\n 2011).[19]\n\nA first possibility to defend the thesis that Water is\nnon-transmissive is to argue that it instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate (considered in\n Sect. 3.2)\n (cf. Wright 2000, 2003, 2011). If Water is non-transmissive,\n\\(s\\) could acquire a justification for, or knowledge of,\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n and\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\n only if \\(s\\) had an independent justification for, or\nknowledge of,\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\).\n (And to avoid the absurd result that McKinsey recoils from, this\nindependent justification should be empirical.) If this diagnosis is\ncorrect, one need not deny \\(\\rP_{10}\\) or \\(\\rP_{11}\\) to reject the\nintuitively false claim that \\(s\\) could know the empirical\nproposition \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) in virtue of only non-empirical\nknowledge.\n\nTo substantiate the thesis that Water instantiates the\ndisjunctive template one should first emphasize that the kind\nof externalism about mental content underlying \\(\\rP_{10}\\) is\ncompatible with the possibility that \\(s\\) suffers from illusion of\ncontent. Were this to happen with \\(\\rP_{10}, s\\) would seem to\nintrospect that she believes that water is wet whereas there is\nnothing like that content to be believed by \\(s\\) in the first\ninstance. Consider:\n\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\).\n \u2018water\u2019 refers to no natural kind so that\nthere is no content expressed by the sentence \u2018water is\nwet\u2019.\n\n\n\\(s\\)\u2019s state of having introspective justification for\nbelieving\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n is arguably subjectively indistinguishable from a situation in which\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\) is true. Thus condition\n (D2)\n of the disjunctive template is met. Moreover,\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\) appears incompatible with an obvious\npresupposition of \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive project of attaining\nintrospective justification for believing \\(\\rP_{10}\\), at least if\nthe content that water is wet embedded in \\(\\rP_{10}\\) is constrained\nby \\(s\\) or her linguistic community having being in contact with\nwater. Thus condition\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n is also met. Furthermore, \\(\\rP_{10}\\) entails \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) (when\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\) is in background information). Hence, condition\n (D1)\n is fulfilled. If one could also show that\n (D4)\n is satisfied in Water, in the sense that if \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\nwere false \\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\) would be true, one would have\nshown that the disjunctive template is satisfied by\nWater. Wright (2000) takes (D4) to be fulfilled and concludes\nthat the disjunctive template is satisfied by\nWater.\n\nUnfortunately, the claim that\n (D4)\n is satisfied in Water cannot easily be vindicated (cf.\nWright 2003). Condition (D4) is satisfied in Water only if it\nis true that if \\(s\\) (or \\(s\\)\u2019s linguistic community) had not\nbeen embedded in an environment that contains water, the term\n\u2018water\u2019 would have referred to no natural kind. This is\ntrue only if the closest possible world \\(w\\) in which this\ncounterfactual\u2019s antecedent is true is like Boghossian\u2019s\n(1997) Dry Earth\u2014namely, a world where no one has ever\nhad any contact with any kind of watery stuff, and all apparent\ncontacts with it are always due to multi-sensory hallucination. If\n\\(w\\) is not Dry Earth, but Putnam\u2019s Twin\nEarth, however, the counterfactual turns out false, as in this\npossible world people usually have contact with some other watery\nstuff that they call \u2018water\u2019. So, in this world\n\u2018water\u2019 refers to a natural kind, though not to\nH2O. Since determining which of Dry Earth or\nTwin Earth is modally closer to the actual world (supposing\n\\(s\\) is in the actual world)\u2014and so determining whether (D4) is\nsatisfied in Water\u2014is a potentially elusive task, the\nclaim that Water instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate appears less than fully\n warranted.[20]\n\nAn alternative dissolution of McKinsey paradox\u2014also based on a\ndiagnosis of non-transmissivity\u2014seems to be available if one\nconsiders the proposition that \n\n\\(\\rQ_{11}\\).\n \\(s\\) (or \\(s\\)\u2019s linguistic community) has been embedded\nin an environment containing some watery substance (cf.\nWright 2003 and 2011).\n\n\nThis alternative strategy assumes that\n \\(\\rQ_{11}\\),\n rather than\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\),\n is a presupposition of \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive project of attaining\nintrospective justification for\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\).\n\nEven if Water doesn\u2019t instantiate the disjunctive\ntemplate, a new diagnosis of what\u2019s wrong with\nMcKinsey\u2019s paradox could rest on the claim that the different\nargument yielded by expanding Water with\n \\(\\rQ_{11}\\)\n as conclusion\u2014call it Water*\u2014instantiates the\ndisjunctive template. If\n \\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\)\n is the same proposition as above, it is easy to see that\nWater* satisfies conditions\n (D4),\n (D2), and\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n of the disjunctive template. Furthermore\n (D1)\n is satisfied at least in the sense that it seems a priori\nthat\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n via\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_{11}\\)\n (if\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\n is in background information) (cf. Wright 2011). On this novel\ndiagnosis of non-transmissivity, what would be paradoxical is that\n\\(s\\) could earn justification for \\(\\rQ_{11}\\) in virtue of her\nnon-empirical justification for \\(\\rP_{10}\\) and \\(\\rP_{11}\\) and her\nknowledge of the a priori link from \\(\\rP_{10}\\),\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\) via \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) to \\(\\rQ_{11}\\). If one follows\nWright\u2019s (2003)\n suggestion[21]\n that \\(s\\) is entitled to accept \\(\\rQ_{11}\\)\u2014namely,\nthe presupposition that there is a watery substance that provides\n\u2018water\u2019 with its extension\u2014Water becomes\ninnocuously transmissive, and the apparent paradox\nsurrounding Water vanishes. This is so at least if one grants\nthat it is a priori that water is the watery stuff of our\nactual acquaintance, once it is presupposed that there is any watery\nstuff of our actual acquaintance.
