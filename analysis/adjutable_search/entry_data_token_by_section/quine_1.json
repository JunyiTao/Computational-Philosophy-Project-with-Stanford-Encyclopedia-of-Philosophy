    "main_text": "Quine\u2019s Naturalism and its Implications || Introduction\n2.1 Introduction\n\nQuine\u2019s philosophical thought is remarkably consistent over the\ncourse of his long working life. There are developments, of course,\nbut outright changes of mind are relatively rare and mostly on\nrelatively minor points. We can, for the most part, treat him as\nhaving a single philosophical orientation, to which what he calls\n\u201cnaturalism\u201d is fundamental. This is not to say that his\nnaturalism is self-conscious and explicit from the start; it is,\nrather, something that he became clearer about over the years. (For\nthe development of Quine\u2019s naturalism, see Verhaegh, 2018; for\nthe very early Quine, see Sinclair 2022.)\n\nThe term \u201cnaturalism\u201d has been understood in various ways;\nwe need to see what Quine\u2019s naturalism comes to. At one point,\nhe describes naturalism as \u201cthe recognition that it is within\nscience itself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to\nbe identified and described\u201d (1981, 21). Two points are\nimportant to note about the idea of \u201cscience\u201d here. First,\nit is less restrictive than it may seem. Quine certainly takes the\nnatural sciences, especially physics, as paradigmatic. As he says\nhimself, however, he uses the word \u201cscience\u201d broadly; he\nexplicitly includes psychology, economics, sociology, and history (see\n1995, 49). Second, Quine does not see scientific knowledge as\ndifferent in kind from our ordinary knowledge; he sees it, rather, as\nthe result of attempts to improve our ordinary knowledge of the world:\n\u201cScience is not a substitute for common sense but an extension\nof it.\u201d (1957, 229). The scientist, he says, \u201cis\nindistinguishable from the common man in his sense of evidence, except\nthat the scientist is more careful.\u201d (1957, 233). We might add\nthat the scientist is more narrowly focused on issues of truth and\nobjectivity and, in the hope of contributing to these goals, clearer\nand more systematic.\n\nMany philosophers would no doubt accept that the methods and\ntechniques of science are the best way to find out about the world.\n(With or without the points just noted about the word\n\u201cscience\u201d.) The distinctiveness of Quine\u2019s\nnaturalism begins to emerge if we ask what justifies this naturalistic\nclaim: what reason do we have to believe that the methods and\ntechniques of science are the best way to find out about the world?\nQuine would insist that this claim too must be based on natural\nscience. (If this is circular, he simply accepts the circularity.)\nThis is the revolutionary step: naturalism self-applied. There is no\nfoundation for Quine\u2019s naturalism: it is not based on anything\nelse.\n\nThe point here is that Quine denies that there is a distinctively\nphilosophical standpoint, which might, for example, allow\nphilosophical reflection to prescribe standards to science as a whole.\nHe holds that all of our attempts at knowledge are subject to those\nstandards of evidence and justification which are most explicitly\ndisplayed, and most successfully implemented, in the natural sciences.\nThis applies to philosophy as well as to other branches of knowledge.\nThe epistemologist, therefore, reflects on science from within\nscience; there is no theory of knowledge distinct from science.\n\u201cEpistemology\u201d, Quine says, \u201c\u2026is contained in\nnatural science, as a chapter of psychology\u201d (1969, 83). (For an\nalternative view of the relation of philosophy to science, based on\ndiscussion of the history of science, see Friedman, 1997.)\n\nIn Quine\u2019s view, philosophers can, therefore, do no better than\nto adopt the standpoint of the best available knowledge, i.e. science,\nin some suitably broad sense. We adopt what he calls \u201cthe\nfundamental conceptual scheme of science and common sense\u201d\n(1960, 276). Philosophers are thus to be constrained by scientific\nstandards. In (1974) he puts it this way: \u201cIn our account of how\nscience might be acquired we do not try to justify science by some\nprior and firmer philosophy, but neither are we to maintain less than\nscientific standards. Evidence must regularly be sought in external\nobjects, out where observers can jointly observe it\u2026.\u201d\n(1974, 34f.)\n",
