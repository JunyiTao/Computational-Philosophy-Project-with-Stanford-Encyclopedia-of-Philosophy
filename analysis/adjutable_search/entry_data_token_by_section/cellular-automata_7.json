    "main_text": "Some Basic Notions and Results || CA in More Dimensions: the Game of Life\n2.5 CA in More Dimensions: the Game of Life\n\nNotwithstanding the computational interest of one-dimensional CA,\nphilosophical issues have been discussed more often in connection with\ntwo-dimensional CA. The first CA, von Neumann\u2019s self-reproducing\nautomaton, inhabited a two-dimensional grid. Besides, two-dimensional\nCA are suitable for representing many physical, biological, and even\nhuman phenomena, ranging from the dynamics of perfect gases to the\nmovements of birds in a storm and soldiers on a battlefield. The most\ncommon configurations have either square or hexagonal cells, given\ntheir translational and rotational symmetries. Moving to two\ndimensions, of course, also expands the possibly interesting\ncombinations of rules and neighborhoods. As for the latter, the two\nmost common options in a grid of squares are the von Neumann\nneighborhood, where each cell interacts only with its four horizontal\nand vertical adjacent mates, and the Moore neighborhood,\ncomprising all the eight immediately adjacent cells.\n\nBy way of example, we introduce the famous Game of Life (or,\nmore briefly, Life) by John Conway (see Berkelamp, Conway,\n& Guy 1982). Life fits well with our usual schema: \n\n2-dimensional lattice of square cells in an orthogonal grid.\n\\(\\Sigma = \\{1, 0\\}\\), so \\(|\\Sigma| = 2\\) (for reasons we are\nabout to see, we can picture 1 as the state of being alive for a given\ncell, 0 as the state of being dead).\nEach cell\u2019s neighborhood is composed of all its eight\nneighboring cells (the Moore neighborhood).\nLife\u2019s transition rule goes as follows. At each\ntime step t exactly one of three things can happen to a cell:\n\n\nBirth: If the cell state at \\(t - 1\\) was 0 (dead), the\ncell state becomes 1 (alive) if exactly three neighbors were 1 (alive)\nat \\(t - 1\\);\nSurvival: If the cell state at \\(t - 1\\) was 1 (alive),\nthe cell state is still 1 if either two or three neighbors were 1\n(alive) at \\(t - 1\\);\n Death: If the cell state at \\(t - 1\\) was 1 (alive), the\ncell state becomes 0 (dead) if either fewer than two or more than\nthree neighbors were 1 (alive) at \\(t - 1\\) (cells can die of\n\u201cloneliness\u201d or \u201coverpopulation\u201d).\n \n\n\nLife would definitely be considered a Class4 CA by\nWolfram\u2019s taxonomy. In this simple setting, periodic structures,\nstable blocks and complex moving patterns come into existence, even\nstarting from a very simple initial configuration. Conway remarked:\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probable, given a large enough Life space,\ninitially in a random state, that after a long time, intelligent,\nself-reproducing animals will emerge and populate some parts of the\nspace. (cited in Ilachinski 2001: 131) \n\n\nLife-fans explored the CA\u2019s possible patterns of\nevolution, and shared their findings in what has been called\nLife\u2019s zoology (Dennett 2003: 41). Here is a small\ngallery of samples together with snapshots of a typical simulation\n(for more pictures and animations, see\n Other Internet Resources\n at the end). Gliders are the most popular among the basic\nLife inhabitants: a simple 5-bit structure, a glider can\ntravel the Life grid in a 4-time step cycle:\n\n\nGlider\n\n\n\n\\(t_{0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{12}\\)\n\n\n\nToads are period 2 blinking configurations: together with\nBlinkers and Beacons they are the simplest\noscillators of the universe. \n\n\nToad\n\n\n\n\\(t_{0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{3}\\)\n\n\n\nEaters have the feature of devouring other configurations,\ne.g., gliders, maintaining intact their own form (because of this,\nthey play an important role for Life\u2019s computational\nabilities).\n\n\nAn Eater devouring a Glider\n\n\n\n\\(t_{0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{4}\\)\n\n\n\nA typical evolution of Life starting from random initial\nconditions may contain all of the above notable figures and much more.\nSome initial configuration may end up, even after few time steps, into\nstatic or simple periodic structures. Other configurations, though,\ncan produce non-periodic, increasingly complex environments whose\ndevelopment can be unpredictable (even in the computational sense we\nare about to explore). As Ilachinski has suggestively conjectured from\nthis: \n\n\nUpon observing the seemingly unlimited complexity and variety of\nLife\u2019s evolving patterns, it becomes almost impossible\nto refrain from imagining, along with Conway, that, were the game\nreally to be played on an infinite lattice, there must surely arise\ntrue living \u201clife-forms\u201d, perhaps themselves evolving into\nmore complex, possibly sentient, \u201corganisms\u201d. (Ilachinski\n2001: 133)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{10}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{20}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{30}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{40}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_{175}\\)\n\n\n\nThe mathematical literature on CA does not refrain from describing the\nLife configurations using the same imaginative vocabulary we\nused: items are born, live, move around,\neat other figures, die, etc. The universe these\npatterns inhabit may also be described, though, as a collection of\nindividual cells, each of which does not directly depend on what is\nhappening on the macro-scale. And the life on Life can also\nbe described in the simple mathematical language of matrices and\ndiscrete sequences. But if one is only told the basic Life\nrule, one could hardly imagine the complexity it can\ngenerate\u2014until one sees it. Life\u2019s reputation\namong scientists and philosophers arguably comes from its challenging\nnaive intuitions about complexity, pattern formation and reality,\npersistence, and continuity: as a toy universe we ourselves built, we\nfeel we should know in advance what dynamics are allowed. This has\nbeen shown to be impossible, in a mathematically precise sense.\n",
