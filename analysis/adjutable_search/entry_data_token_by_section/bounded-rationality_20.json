Even though this outcome is often seen in economic\nexperiments, in broader society cooperative behavior is pervasive\n(Bowles & Gintis 2011). Why? The traditional evolutionary\nexplanations of human cooperation in terms of reputation,\nreciprocation, and retribution (Trivers 1971; R.\nAlexander 1987), are unsatisfactory because they do not uniquely\nexplain why cooperation is a stable behavior. If a group punishes\nindividuals for failing to perform a behavior, and the punishment\ncosts exceed the benefit of doing that behavior, then this behavior\nwill become stable regardless of its social benefits. Anti-social\nnorms arguably take root by precisely the same mechanisms (Bicchieri\n& Muldoon 2014). Although reputation, reciprocation, and\nretribution may explain how large-scale cooperation is sustained in\nhuman societies, it does not explain how the behavior emerged (Boyd\n& Richerson 2005). Furthermore, cooperation is observed in\nmicroorganisms (Damore & Gore 2012), which suggests that much\nsimpler mechanisms are sufficient for the emergence of cooperative\nbehavior.\n\nWhereas the 1970s saw a broader realization of the advantages of\nimproper models to yield results that were often good enough\n (section 2.3),\n the 1980s and 1990s witnessed a series of results involving improper\nmodels yielding results that were strictly better than what was\nprescribed by the corresponding proper model. In the early 1980s\nRobert Axelrod held a tournament to empirically test which among a\ncollection of strategies for playing iterations of the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma performed best in a round-robin competition.\nThe winner was a simple reciprocal altruism strategy called\ntit-for-tat (Rapoport & Chammah 1965), which simply\nstarts off each game cooperating then, on each successive round,\ncopies the strategy the opposing player played in the previous round.\nSo, if your opponent cooperated in this round, then you will cooperate\non the next round; and if your opponent defected this round, then you\nwill defect the next. Subsequent tournaments have shown that\ntit-for-tat is remarkably robust against much more sophisticated\nalternatives (Axelrod 1984). For example, even a rational utility\nmaximizing player playing against an opponent who only plays\ntit-for-tat (i.e., will play tit-for-tat no matter whom he faces) must\nadapt and play tit-for-tat\u2014or a strategy very close to it\n(Kreps, Milgrom, et al. 1982).\n\nSince tit-for-tat is a very simple strategy, computationally, one can\nbegin to explore a notion of rationality that emerges in a group of\nboundedly rational agents and even see evidence of those bounds\ncontributing to the emergence of pro-social norms. Rubinstein\n(Rubinstein 1986) studied finite automata which play repeated\nprisoner\u2019s dilemmas and whose aims are to maximize average\npayoff while minimizing the number of states of a machine. Finite\nautomata capture regular languages, the lowest-level of the\nChomsky-hierarchy, thus model a type of boundedly rational agents.\nSolutions are a pair of machines in which the choice of the machine is\noptimal for each player at every stage of the game. In an evolutionary\ninterpretation of repeated games, each iteration of Rubinstein\u2019s\ncan be seen as successive generations of agents. This approach is in\ncontrast to Neyman\u2019s study of players of repeated games who can\nonly play mixtures of pure strategies that can be programmed on finite\nautomata, where the number of states that are available is an\nexogenous variable whose value is fixed by the modeler. In\nNeyman\u2019s model, each generation plays the entire game and thus\ntraits connected to reputation can arise (Neyman 1985). More\ngenerally, although cooperation is impossible for infinitely repeated\nprisoner\u2019s dilemmas, for finitely repeated prisoner\u2019s\ndilemmas, a cooperative equilibrium exists for finite automata players\nwhose number of states is less than exponential in the number of\nrounds of the game (Papadimitriou & Yannakakis 1994; Ho 1996). The\ndemands on memory may exceed the psychological capacities of people,\nhowever, even for simple strategies like tit-for-tat played by a\nmoderately sized group of players (Stevens, Volstorf, et al. 2011).\nThese theoretical models showing a number of simple paths to\npro-social behavior may not, on their own, be simple enough to offer\nplausible process models for cooperation.\n\nOn the heels of work on the effects of time (finite iteration versus\ninfinite iteration) and memory/cognitive ability (finite state\nautomata versus Turing machines), attention soon turned to\nenvironmental constraints. Nowak and May looked at the spatial\ndistribution on a two-dimensional grid of \u2018cooperators\u2019\nand \u2018defectors\u2019 in iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemmas and\nfound cooperation to emerge among players without memories or\nstrategic foresight (Nowak & May 1992). This work led to the study\nof network topology as a factor in social behavior (Jackson\n2010), including social norms (Bicchieri 2005; J. Alexander 2007),\nsignaling (Skyrms 2003), and wisdom of crowd effects (Golub &\nJackson 2010). When social ties in a network follow a scale-free\ndistribution, the resulting diversity in the number and size of\npublic-goods games is found to promote cooperation, which contributes\nto explaining the emergence of cooperation in communities without\nmechanisms for reputation and punishment (F. Santos, M. Santos, &\nPacheco 2008).\n\nBut, perhaps the simplest case for bounded rationality are examples of\nagents achieving a desirable goal without any deliberation at all.\nInsects, flowers, and even bacteria exhibit evolutionary stable\nstrategies (Maynard Smith 1982), effectively arriving at Nash\nequilibria in strategic normal form games. If we imagine two species\ninteracting with one another, say honey bees (Apis mellifera)\nand a species of flower, each interaction between a bee and a flower\nhas some bearing on the fitness of each species, where fitness is\ndefined as the expected number of offspring. There is an incremental\npayoff to bees and flowers, possibly negative, after each interaction,\nand the payoffs are determined by the genetic endowments of bees and\nflowers each. The point is that there is no choice exhibited by these\norganisms nor in the models; the process itself selects the traits.\nThe agents have no foresight. There are no strategies that the players\nthemselves choose. The process is entirely mechanical. What emerges in\nthis setting are evolutionary dynamics, a form of bounded\nrationality without foresight.\n\nOf course, any improper model can misfire. A rule of thumb shared by\npeople the world-over is to not let other people take advantage of\nthem. While this rule works most of the time, it misfires in the\nultimatum game (G\u00fcth, Schmittberger, & Schwarze\n1982). The ultimatum game is a two-player game in which one player,\nendowed with a sum of money, is given the task of splitting the sum\nwith another player who may either accept the offer\u2014in which\ncase the pot is accordingly split between the two players\u2014or\nreject, in which case both players receive nothing. People\nreceiving offers of 30 percent or less of the pot are often observed\nto reject the offer, even when players are anonymous and therefore\nwould not suffer the consequences of a negative reputation signal\nassociated with accepting a very low offer. In such cases, one might\nreasonably argue that no proposed split is worse than the status quo\nof zero, so people ought to accept whatever they are offered.\n",
