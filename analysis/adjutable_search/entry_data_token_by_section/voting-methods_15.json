    "main_text": "Topics in Voting Theory || Computational Social Choice\n4.4 Computational Social Choice\n\nOne of the most active and exciting areas of research that is focused,\nin part, on the study of voting methods and voting paradoxes is\ncomputational social choice. This is an interdisciplinary\nresearch area that uses ideas and techniques from theoretical computer\nscience and artificial intelligence to provide new perspectives and to\nask new questions about methods for making group decisions; and to use\nvoting methods in computational domains, such as recommendation\nsystems, information retrieval, and crowdsourcing. It is beyond the\nscope of this article to survey this entire research area. Readers are\nencouraged to consult the Handbook of Computational Social\nChoice (Brandt et al. 2016) for an overview of this field (cf.\nalso Endriss 2017). In the remainder of this section, I briefly\nhighlight some work from this research area related to issues\ndiscussed in this article. \n\nSection 4.1 discussed election scenarios in which voters choose their\nballots strategically and briefly introduced the Gibbard-Satterthwaite\nTheorem. This theorem shows that every voting method satisfying\nnatural properties has profiles in which there is some voter, called a\nmanipulator, that can achieve a better outcome by selecting a\nballot that misrepresents her preferences. Importantly, in order to\nsuccessfully manipulate an election, the manipulator must not only\nknow which voting method is being used but also how the other members\nof society are voting. Although there is some debate about whether\nmanipulation in this sense is in fact a problem (Dowding and van Hees\n2008; Conitzer and Walsh, 2016, Section 6.2), there is interest in\nmechanisms that incentivize voters to report their\n\u201ctruthful\u201d preferences. In a seminal paper, Bartholdi et\nal. (1989) argue that the complexity of computing which ballot will\nlead to a preferred outcome for the manipulator may provide a barrier\nto voting insincerely. See Faliszewski and Procaccia 2010, Faliszewski\net al. 2010, Walsh 2011, Brandt et al. 2013, and Conitzer and Walsh\n2016 for surveys of the literature on this and related questions, such\nas the the complexity of determining the winner given a voting method\nand the complexity of determining which voter or voters should be\nbribed to change their vote to achieve a given outcome. \n\nOne of the most interesting lines of research in computational social\nchoice is to use techniques and ideas from AI and theoretical computer\nscience to design new voting methods. The main idea is to think of\nvoting methods as solutions to an optimization problem. Consider the\nspace of all rankings of the alternatives \\(X\\). Given a profile of\nrankings, the voting problem is to find an \u201coptimal\u201d group\nranking (cf. the discussion or distance-based\nrationalizations of voting methods from Elkind et al. 2015). What\ncounts as an \u201coptimal\u201d group ranking depends on\nassumptions about the type of the decision that the group is making.\nOne assumption is that the voters have real-valued utilities\nfor each candidate, but are only able to report rankings of the\nalternatives (it is assumed that the rankings represent the utility\nfunctions). The voting problem is to identify the candidates that\nmaximizes the (expected) social welfare (the average of the voters\u2019\nutilities), given the  partial information about the voters\u2019\nutilities\u2014i.e., the profile of rankings of the candidates. See\nPivato 2015 for a discussion of this approach to voting and Boutilier\net al. 2015 for algorithms that solve different versions of this\nproblem. A second assumption is that there is an objectively correct\nranking of the alternatives and the voters\u2019 rankings are noisy\nestimates of this ground truth. This way of thinking about the voting\nproblem was introduced by Condorcet and discussed in Section 4.3.\nProcaccia et al. (2016) import ideas from the theory of\nerror-correcting codes to develop an interesting new approach to\naggregate rankings viewed as noisy estimates of some ground truth.\n\n",
