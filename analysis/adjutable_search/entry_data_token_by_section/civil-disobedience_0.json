    "main_text": "Features of Civil Disobedience\n1. Features of Civil Disobedience\n\nHenry David Thoreau is widely credited with coining the term civil\ndisobedience. For years, Thoreau refused to pay his state poll\ntax as a protest against the institution of slavery, the extermination\nof Native Americans, and the war against Mexico. When a Concord,\nMassachusetts, constable named Sam Staples asked Thoreau to pay his\nback taxes in 1846 and Thoreau refused, Staples escorted him to jail.\nIn a public lecture that Thoreau gave twice in 1848, he justified his\ntax refusal as a way to withdraw cooperation with the government and\nhe called on his fellow townspeople to do the same. Thoreau\u2019s\nlecture, titled \u201cThe Rights and Duties of the Individual in\nrelation to Government,\u201d formed the basis of his 1849 essay,\n\u201cResistance to Civil Government.\u201d In 1866, four years\nafter Thoreau\u2019s death, the essay was republished under the title\n\u201cCivil Disobedience.\u201d Some scholars believe the new title\nwas provided by Thoreau\u2019s sister Sophia, his sole literary\nexecutor and sole editor of his posthumous edited works (Fedorko\n2016). But others have provided evidence for Thoreau\u2019s authority\nover the edits in the 1866 text (Dawson 2007).\n\nWhereas Thoreau understood the \u201ccivil\u201d in civil\ndisobedience to characterize the political relations between civilian\nsubjects and their civil government, today most scholars and activists\nunderstand the \u201ccivil\u201d to relate to civility\n\u2013 a kind of self-restraint necessary for concord under\nconditions of pluralism. The next sub-sections review central features\nof civil disobedience.\n",
