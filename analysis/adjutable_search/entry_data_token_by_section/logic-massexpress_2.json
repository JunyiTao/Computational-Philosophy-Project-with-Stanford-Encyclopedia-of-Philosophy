    "main_text": "What are mass expressions? || Semantic criteria\n1.2 Semantic criteria\n\n\nAt the semantic level, two properties have been proposed as being\ncharacteristic of mass nouns: cumulative reference and distributive\nreference. But as we shall see, cumulative reference is also a property\nof plurals, while distributive reference doesn\u2019t apply to all mass\nnouns.\n\n\nSince Quine (1960), it is generally accepted that mass nouns refer\ncumulatively. Consider a mass noun M. Suppose that we can\ntruly say of something x that This is M (with\nthis referring to x) and of something distinct,\ny, that This is M (with this now referring to\ny). Then in the same circumstance, we can also refer to\nx and y together, and say of x and y that\nThis is M. This property of mass nouns is called cumulative\nreference.  Plural count nouns also have the same property. Let\nNs be a plural count noun. If these are Ns and those are Ns,\nthen we can refer to these and those together, and say of all of them\nthat they are Ns.\n\n\nVarious authors have proposed that mass nouns also refer\ndistributively (e.g., Cheng 1973; ter Meulen 1981). Let M be a\nmass noun. Suppose that we can truly say of something x that This\nis M (with this referring to x). Then in the same\ncircumstance, for anything y that is part of x, we can also say of y\nthat This is M (with this now referring to y).\nHowever, with many mass nouns, the property doesn\u2019t apply when one\nconsiders parts that are small enough. Water is made of oxygen and\nhydrogen, but oxygen isn\u2019t water. And with mass nouns like\nfurniture or silverware, the problem appears even\nmore clearly, at the macroscopic level: a table is furniture, a leg of\nthe table is part of the table, but the leg isn\u2019t furniture.\nThus, the thesis that mass nouns refer distributively is mistaken\n(e.g., Gillon 1992; Nicolas 2002).\n\n\nA first attempt to defend the view would be as follows. Bunt (1985)\nand others have proposed that, although modern science is in conflict\nwith the claim that the mass noun water refers distributively,\nEnglish speakers use the noun as if it did. The problem with this\nsuggestion is that it cannot be falsified, since it puts aside the very\ncases that would do so. So it doesn\u2019t seem to be an empirical\nhypothesis and it doesn\u2019t appear to make any prediction. What benefit\nwould there be to add this claim to any theory?\n\n\nA better attempt would consist, in effect, in attributing a weaker\nproperty to mass nouns. As we will see in section\n2, an approach based on mereology may well, contrary to what is\nusually assumed, want to use a non-extensional mereology, where the\nnotion of part is defined in terms of the notion of sum. If\ndistributive reference were understood using such a notion of part, it\ncould avoid the problems mentioned here. There is nothing wrong with\nthat, but then, the property attributed to mass nouns would be much\nweaker than that originally advocated by its partisans (see Nicolas\n2002, chapter 3, for a proposal of this kind).  The claim made here is\nsimply that distributive reference, as usually conceived, is not a\nproperty of mass nouns.\n\n\nBut more generally, it seems that there are no necessary and\nsufficient semantic conditions that would specify what mass nouns are\nand what count nouns are (see Gillon 1992, Koslicki 1999, and Nicolas\n2002 for detailed arguments to this effect[3]; a contrario, see for\ninstance Landman 2011). A common noun that is mass in a language (like\nluggage in English) may be count in another (like\nbagage in French). The distinction between mass nouns and\ncount nouns should be drawn syntactically. A key feature of count nouns\nis that they admit the singular / plural contrast while mass nouns do\nnot. So languages that do not mark the singular / plural contrast could\nlack count nouns and all their common nouns function in a similar way\nas mass nouns do in English. This might the case of certain classifier\nlanguages, like Mandarin (Chierchia 1998,\n 2010).[4]\nAlternatively, the mass / count distinction could\njust fail to apply to such languages. The proper way to draw the mass /\ncount distinction across languages is still debated (see Doetjes 2012, Rothstein 2017, and Bale & Barner 2018 for cross-linguistic overviews).\n\n\nIn the rest of this entry, we examine how sentences containing mass\nnouns are interpreted, i.e., how their truth-conditions can be\nspecified. We consider several approaches to the semantics of mass\nnouns. Even though a given approach may turn out to be unsatisfactory,\nit is important to know in what precise respects it fails. For some of\nits key proposals may be retained in (or transposed to) a better,\noverall framework.\n",
