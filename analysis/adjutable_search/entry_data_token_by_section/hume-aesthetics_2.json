    "main_text": "Beauty and Taste in Hume\u2019s Moral Theory || Subjectivism\n3.1 Subjectivism\n\nHume proposes that feeling, not thought, informs us that an object is\nbeautiful or ugly, or that an action exhibits virtue or vice:\n\u201cThe very feeling constitutes our praise or\nadmiration\u201d (T, 471). The feeling or sentiment is itself an\naesthetic or moral discrimination. It is prior to, and the basis of,\nany subsequent expression of praise or admiration. The sentiment\nis the beauty of the object and it is the virtue of\ndesirable human action. Sentiment is the sole source of values\ngoverning human activity. Taste is a \u201cproductive faculty, and\ngilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed\nfrom internal sentiment, raises, in a manner, a new creation.\u201d\nThat new creation is \u201cbeauty and deformity, virtue and\nvice\u201d (EPM, 294). However, the sentiment is calm rather than\nviolent, so an unphilosophical perspective treats it as a property\n\u201cof the object\u201d (S, 218). \n\nThis moral and aesthetic subjectivism attracts Hume for the same\nreason that it attracts Hutcheson. The appeal to sentiment offers a\nmiddle position between the two prevailing theories within English\nletters, Hobbesian egoism and ethical rationalism. Hutcheson holds\nthat virtue and beauty are not qualities of the people and things to\nwhich they are attributed. We may speak as if objects and people have\nmoral and aesthetic properties, but the relevant property is merely an\n\u201cidea raised in us.\u201d Hume alters Hutcheson\u2019s theory\nby imposing his own philosophical vocabulary, making beauty an\nimpression rather than an idea. But they agree that to describe a\nperson as virtuous or an object as beautiful is to make a claim about\ntheir tendency to cause a certain response. Is it imprudent and\n\u201ctoo strong,\u201d Hume asks Hutcheson, to summarize the thesis\nin the following terms (HL, I, 39\u201340)? \u201c[W]hen you\npronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but\nthat from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or\nsentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue,\ntherefore, may be compared to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which,\naccording to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but\nperceptions in the mind\u201d (T, 469). Emphasizing Hume\u2019s debt\nto Hutcheson, Kivy (2003, pp. 307\u2013310), argues that Hume\nunderstands beauty very much on the model of colors. Although they are\nsecondary qualities and so do not directly reveal the properties of\nthe occasioning object, some color perception is \u201ctrue and\nreal\u201d (SOT, 272), and so it is for Hume likewise with beauty.\nHowever, virtue and beauty are not strictly analogous to secondary\nqualities, such as heat and cold, because a critic\u2019s claim that\na work is beautiful involves an element of endorsement that does not\narise in the observation that ice is cold. The case against reading\nHumean beauty on the model of ideas of secondary qualities is provided\nby Shiner (1996) and Taylor (2011).\n\nHume defends the centrality of sentiment with the following reasoning.\nRecognitions of virtue and beauty require particular sentiments in\nhuman observers. If the discriminations of taste took place without\nthese sentiments, we would lack any motivation to do what we regard as\nmoral. Moral and aesthetic judgments have practical consequences that\nmere reason lacks. So taste differs from the assent that characterizes\nunderstanding or reason (T, 458; EPM, 172; S, 219). Although taste\nresponds to real qualities of objects, we cannot replace the exercise\nof taste with the assent of reason. In many cases, beauty and\ngracefulness (both aesthetic and moral) are inexplicable; they resist\nour efforts at explication, and we must trust the \u201csure\ntestimony of taste and sentiment\u201d (EPM, 267).\n\nEpistemically, taste is nonetheless a fallible indicator of beauty and\ndeformity. The underlying sentiments never \u201crefer\u201d to\nanything in their cause (SOT, 268). Feelings do not represent any\naspect of their occasioning objects, and they are easily attached to\nobjects other than their cause (T, 280). (As with any causal\nrelationship, such as the causal link between smoke and fire, an\nisolated effect does not refer back to its cause, nor does it provide\nus with information about the nature of the object or event that\ncauses it. If we experience smoke but have never experienced fire, the\nsmoke will tell us nothing about the nature of fire.) As effects of\nour interaction with the world, sentiments cannot reliably inform us\nabout the nature of their causes. It will not always be clear, prior\nto careful attention and reflection, which features of a work of art\nare responsible for our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation.\nOn Hume\u2019s analysis, the chain running from cause to effect turns\nout to be extremely complex, for the relationship is indirect and\n\u201cthe human body is a mighty complicated machine\u201d with many\n\u201csecret powers\u201d (EHU, 87; see also SOT, 270). Knowing\nthis, good critics pronounce their verdicts only after they clarify\nhow their own sentiments relate to the object that is being evaluated\n(SOT, 270\u201371).\n\nHowever, some of Hume\u2019s critics see a fundamental contradiction\nbetween his subjectivism and his distinction between better and worse\ncritics or the possession of better and worse taste. The criticism is\nmost often formulated against Hume\u2019s parallel discussion of\nethical evaluation. A particularly forceful statement of the objection\nis provided by Philippa Foot (1966). Hume was acutely aware of the\ngeneral problem and it is the starting point of the essay \u201cOf\nthe Standard of Taste.\u201d (See\n Section 4\n below.)\n",
