    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nPrice was born on 17 May 1899 and died on 26 November 1984. He was\nborn in Neath, a small, then industrial town in South Wales, and\neducated at the famous public school Winchester College, whose\nstudents are called Wykehamists. He studied Literae Humaniores\n(\u201cGreats\u201d, covering Ancient History, Ancient Literature,\nand Philosophy) at New College, Oxford, where the cleverest\nWykehamists go, both colleges being founded by William of Wykeham in\nthe fourteenth century. He had the perfect Wykehamist career: being\nWykeham Professor of Logic from the remarkably young age of 35 in 1935\nuntil his retirement in 1959 (Harrison 1993: 479). He had a very\ndistinguished academic career (Quinton 1995a: 676; 1995b: 252),\nreceiving many honours and prestigious invitations and was known as an\nexcellent philosophy lecturer (Mitchell 2009: 45\u201346). He was a\nconstructive philosopher, attempting constantly to develop approaches\nand not satisfied with the demolition of extant views. Famously, Price\nis credited with punching a hole in the isolation of Oxford philosophy\nin the inter-war period by discussing philosophy with Moore and Broad\nin Cambridge, especially on perception, and importing the new approach\nto philosophy developed there with, in Quinton\u2019s (1995a: 675)\nwords, \u201cstyle, rigour, and authority\u201d (see also 1995c:\n708; Mabbott 1986: 78). He was extremely polite, usually trying to\nformulate the views of other philosophers and students, especially if\nhe disagreed with them, in the best way possible (Price [1945: 2]\ndiscusses this in his balanced response to critics of clarificatory\nphilosophy). For example, he finds some merit in the\ntraditional imagistic model of thought (1951\u20131952; 1969). His\nimpact on students was significant. Anscombe recalls, \u201cof all\nthe people I heard at Oxford, he was the one who excited my respect;\nthe one I found worth listening to\u201d (1981: viii; Mac Cumhaill\n& Wiseman 2022: 76f). He supervised several philosophers who went\non to have distinguished careers themselves, including Wilfrid Sellars\n(for some reflections, see Sellars 1975: 285) and D.M. Armstrong.\n",
