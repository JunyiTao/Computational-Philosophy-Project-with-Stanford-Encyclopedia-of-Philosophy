    "main_text": "Bacon\u2019s Later Philosophy: Language Study and Science in the Service of both Moral Philosophy and Theology || Opus maius/Part Seven: Moralis philosophia\n5.5 Opus maius/Part Seven: Moralis philosophia\n\nBacon\u2019s Moralis philosophia (= Opus maius, VII\n= RBMP) comprises the philosophy of religion, social philosophy, a\ntheory of the virtues, an astrological-sociology of religion and\ncultures, and an account of argument and rhetoric.\n\nBacon describes the object of moral inquiry as follows: \u201cThis\nscience is preeminently active, that is, operative, and deals with our\nactions in this life and the other life\u201d ([RBMP], 3). It is\nfocused on human action. Of course, many human actions deal with\nissues that are the concern of the natural and linguistic sciences.\nBacon notes that these sciences are active and operative but concerned\n\u201c\u2026with artificial and natural works which refer to the\nspeculative intellect, and they are not concerned with those things\nwhich refer to the practical intellect, which is called practical\nbecause it exercises operations of good and evil\u201d ([RBMP],\n3). These works of the human being (operabilia) are\n\u201c\u2026more difficult to know than the objects of speculative\nknowledge.\u201d These include \u201c\u2026the highest truths\nconcerning God and divine worship, eternal life, the laws of Justice,\nthe glory of peace, and the sublimity of the virtues\u201d ([RBMP],\n247). For Bacon, the human ability to deal with these topics is\naffected by a certain corruption of the human will. \n\nMoral science has two parts. The first is speculative, dealing with\nultimate moral truths. The second deals with the process of moral\npersuasion: \u201cThe practical part is related to the first part as\nthe curing of the sick and the conserving of health, which are treated\nin practical medicine, are related to that part of medicine which\nteaches what health is\u2026\u201d ([RBMP], 248).\n\nPart one deals with the object and method of morals science and with\nan outline of a philosophical anthropology based on Platonic,\nAristotelian, and Stoic texts in which Bacon argues for an Augustinian\nview of the place of human beings in the world. This includes a\nsection on metaphysical proof for God\u2019s existence. And the\nancient source texts are treated as testifying to the universal\nreligion of Christianity. Part two is a very brief outline of the\nstructure of social life, taken from Avicenna.\n\nPart three, the most substantial in the book, is concerned with virtue\nand vice. Bacon\u2019s own text for this part of the Opus\nmaius still exists and one can see his personal editorial remarks\nin the margins. He did not have time to write a formal treatise, and\nso he presents an anthology of texts from Seneca and excerpts from\nCicero with comment. This is preceded by a brief resume of Aristotle\non the virtues. But it is clear that Bacon favors the image of the\nStoic wise person as his model for virtue. Bacon places great emphasis\non magnanimity as a virtue for the Prince and Prelate. Magnanimity of\nthe greatest of the natural virtues. And it must not be confused with\nChristian humility. This distances Bacon from Bernard of Clairvaux and\nBonaventure. For Bacon, Christian humility has its own distinctive\nrole reflecting the relation of the human to the cosmos and to God.\nAbove all, Bacon is concerned with reproducing as much of the\nAristotelian and Stoic accounts of virtues as possible, and he is\nconcerned with making the Dialogues of Seneca known to Pope\nClement IV. In particular, he is most of all concerned with\nSeneca\u2019s De ira, which he regards as a fundamental text\nfor the moral instruction of princes and prelates. Certainly, Bacon,\nas he does in the Secretum secretorum, presents himself as a\nmoral advisor to Princes. \n\nPart four provides an astrological sociology of human nations or\n\u201csects\u201d, relying on the moral/political account of\nal-Farabi and on the astrological views of Abu Ma\u2019shar\n(Albumassar). Bacon had a wide knowledge of the world including the\ncustoms of the Mongols, and so he compares Mongol, Jewish, Arab, and\nPagan civilizations.\n\nPart five deals with the role of rhetoric in moral persuasion. Bacon\nis convinced that rhetoric is closely connected with logic, and\nbelieved that the university system failed by teaching only grammar\nand logic (linguistics). The omission from the university curriculum\nof rhetoric and poetics, as found in Aristotle and as interpreted by\nal-Farabi and Averroes, was in Bacon\u2019s view a mistake. He knows\nthe latest translations and remarks:\n\n\nBut al-Farabi has presented to us the meaning of this kind of\nargument, and Avicenna, al-Ghazali, and Averroes have done likewise.\nBecause of this, one ought to present an account of the nature of\npoetic argument, and it falls to logic alone to compose such\na book, since the composition of argumentation pertains to\nlogic alone\u2026The appropriate presentation of this\nargument is found in [my] Moralis philosophia, and in its\nuse, and likewise in theological proofs and doctrines; and in such\nmoral matters, this kind of argument moves a [person] much more than\ndoes a demonstrative argument since it has much greater power. And I\nhave already composed a treatise on this [rhetorical-poetic] argument\nin my works on logic, and I have shown there what is proper\nto this science. ([OHI, XVI], 16\u201317)\n\n\nHe continues and notes that according to Aristotle and al-Farabi, this\nargument makes use of appropriate language so that the self can be led\nto virtue and to overcome of vice. He then links up the Greek and\nIslamic sources with the regular sources in the Latin tradition such\nas Cicero, Seneca, and Augustine. And he distinguishes carefully\nbetween demonstrative, dialectical, and rhetorical forms of\nargument.\n5.6 Bacon\u2019s Political Philosophy: the Secretum secretorum\n\nBacon devoted considerable time to the study of this work, the Latin\ntranslation of the Arabic work on statecraft in the tradition of\nMirrors for Princes entitled Sirr-al-\u2018asrar. He worked on\nthe text at Paris and completed the edition of this text with\nintroduction and notes at Oxford after his return there from Paris c.\n1280. This is the most important text on government and the education\nof the Prince prior to the writing of The Prince by\nMachiavelli. The work is divided into four parts. Part one begins with\nthe letter of Alexander to Aristotle and deals with the king\u2019s\nmaintenance of the kingdom. It deals with virtues, largesse, and\ngifts. It is an account of the behavior expected of a King. Part two\ndeals with health care, medicine, and the origins of the sciences.\nPart three deals with alchemy and with the human emotional structure.\nPart four deals with physiognomy and anthropology. Bacon\u2019s\nintroduction is substantial, consisting of seven chapters. It is\nclosely connected with his account of astrology in Opus maius,\npart four, and with scientia experimentalis in part six. His\nsources are mostly Islamic and include the De radiis and De\naspectibus of al-Kindi and the introduction to astrology of Abu\nMa\u2019shar. Bacon proposes a kind of statistical predictive\nastrology, and so has to deal explicitly with the issue of freedom and\ndeterminism. He objects to a kind of infallibilist necessitarianism\nand thinks that provided \u201cpossibility\u201d and\n\u201ccontingency\u201d can be guarded, one can predict what can\nhappen in nature and in human society (due to the effects of the\nelements on temperament) in a general manner. Thus, the ruler will\nhave need of the astrologer who will function as a kind of doctor,\npsychologist, sociologist, and political theorist. This is a far cry\nfrom a contemplative ethics. It is significant that in the work\nentitled Errores philosophorum ascribed to Giles of Rome, a\ncontemporary of Bacon at Paris, many of Bacon\u2019s sources are\nseverely criticized. In the De regimine principium (1280s),\nGiles, unlike Bacon, provides a moral education for the prince that is\nentirely based on Greek and Latin sources, especially on\nAristotle.\n\nThe idea of secrecy and secret books associated with Roger Bacon\ncontinued into the Renaissance (Kavey 2007), with the depiction of\nRoger Bacon on stage in a drama by Robert Greene.\n6. Conclusion\n\nIt will be clear from this account that Roger Bacon was an important\nteacher of the Arts at Paris in the 1240s. He was ahead of his time in\nthe vigorous manner in which he integrated the new Aristotle with the\ntraditional Latin traditions of grammar and logic. He taught for a\nlong period in the Arts. He later called himself an expert in the\nphilosophy of Aristotle as interpreted by Avicenna and Averroes. And\nwe should also add Avicebron (Solomon Ibn Gabirol). By 1248\u201349 he\nseems to have become an independent scholar. He then, it would seem,\nreturned to England, where, under the influence of Adam Marsh, friend\nof Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, he was attracted to\ninterests associated with both scholars: language study including the\nlearning of ancient languages, experimental concerns such as optics\nand experimental science, and a renewed critical study of the text of\nScripture. When Bacon returned to Paris in the 1250s, he was to oppose\nwhat had become a profound change in the methodology of university\nlearning, that is, the introduction of the\n\u201cSentence-Method\u201d into the study of theology. For Bacon,\nthis was a destruction of practices that he associated with Robert\nGrosseteste. Taking up the flag of the Bishop of Lincoln (d. 1253), he\nbecame the great critic of the Parisian mode of doing philosophy and\ntheology. As we saw above, Bacon was already by 1266 very concerned\nwith the new heterodox interpretations of Aristotle found in the\nFaculty of Arts. His later works for Pope Clement IV must be read in\nthe context of the Parisian debates on Latin Averroism\n(1266\u20131277).\n\nThe later Roger Bacon has a good knowledge of the geography and\nhistory of the world and an awareness of geo-politics. In this\ncontext, he devoted much time to the important work on the education\nof the Prince, the Secretum secretorum. He may have returned to\nOxford c. 1280, if not before. There, he completed his edition, with\nnotes and introduction, of this work. In his last work, the\nCompendium studii theologiae (c. 1292), he repeats some of the\nmain arguments from the 1260s against Richard Rufus of Cornwall. Roger\nBacon sets out themes in his philosophy of language, philosophy of\nnature, and moral philosophy and theology that would influence\nfourteenth century writers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham,\namong others. Jeremiah Hackett examines the influence of Roger Bacon\non the philosophy of mind in John Pecham (Hackett 2018c).\nBacon\u2019s influence on the fourteenth century has been documented\nby Katherine H. Tachau (1988). He is much more important for the\nphilosophy of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries than has\nhitherto been recognized. The editors of Peter of John Olivi on matter\nhave noted the appropriation by Olivi of Bacon\u2019s teaching on\nmatter. Doninique Demange and Yael Kedar have demonstrated Peter John\nOlivi\u2019s critical appropriation of Bacon\u2019s theory of Vision\nand his natural philosophy (Demange & Kedar, 2020). Jeremiah\nHackett (2018a) has suggested that in the early to mid-1260s, Olivi\nmay have been the Iuvenis Johannes, Bacon\u2019s star student.\nRecently, Mattia Montovani has written a very important study on the\nimportance of Bacon\u2019s theory of vision for the new Cartesian\ndiscussions of vision in the early 17th century. It is a study of\nmajor significance for the influence of Bacon on early modern\nphilosophy. (Montovani 2020) As noted above, the newly formed\nRoger Bacon Research Society will in the near future do much\nto further the study of the scientific, philosophical and theological\nworks of Roger Bacon.
