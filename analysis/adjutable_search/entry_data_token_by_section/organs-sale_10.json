    "main_text": "Inducements and Consent\n5. Inducements and Consent\n\n\nMonetary incentives, it is sometimes argued, make valid consent\ndifficult, impossible, or problematic (Radcliffe Richards\n2010, 2012). Some of the main arguments offered for this view are that\u2014\n\nFinancial incentives encourage people to do things that they would\nnot otherwise do.\nFinancial incentives encourage people to do things that are likely\nto be harmful to them and which go against their \u2018better\njudgement\u2019.\nFinancial incentives can make people's actions, consents, and\ndecisions less autonomous or less voluntary (Wilkinson 2005).\n\n\n\n(a) will not work. For the fact that payments encourage people\nto do things that they otherwise would not does not, in and of itself,\ninvalidate consent. If it did, consent problems would be endemic\nand occur every time someone was encouraged by payment to go to work\nfor wages or to surrender property for a price. So although some people\nwould only provide organs because of the money, this fact alone would\nnot invalidate consent.\n\n\n(b) is more plausible. Or at least it is plausible to suppose\nthat we ought not to encourage donors to subject themselves to more\nthan a certain level of danger. But the fundamental problem with\nthis would be not payment or consent, but rather the fact that they are\nexposed to too much danger. So, provided that we have an adequate\nway of controlling and regulating risk to organ sellers this particular\nworry about payment ought not to arise.\n\n\nThis is supported by two additional considerations.\n\n\nFirst, as mentioned earlier, the amount of danger remains the same\nregardless of whether or not payment takes place. So if someone\nobjects to paying donors on the grounds that payment will encourage\nexcessive risk-taking, s/he ought to object to donation itself\n(including free donation) not just the payment. Imagine someone\nwho objects to paying astronauts on the grounds that it encourages them\nto do something excessively dangerous. Surely we should say to\nher that, if the objection is danger, s/he should object to space\ntravel in general, not (just) to paid space\ntravel. Much the same goes for paying organ donors. If the\nworry is danger, we should object to dangerous donation of all kinds,\nnot just the paid variety.\n\n\nSecond, it is not clear that monetary incentives make people act\nagainst their better interests or judgement. Indeed, this is a\nrather surprising view to take since people trade off monetary gains\nand losses against other factors on a daily basis; commerce and work\nrequire us to do this all the time. So if an adequately informed\nand competent person decides, after deliberation, that it is worth\nsubjecting herself to a given risk in return for $10,000 then we should\nnot just assume that s/he is acting against her better judgement since,\nfor all we know, the $10,000 is more valuable to her than avoiding the\nrisk (Wilkinson 2005).\n\n\nFinally, there is (c): the idea that financial incentives, when\nallowed to operate in certain conditions, \u2018pressurise\u2019\npeople in ways which are harmful and/or which render their decisions\nnot truly voluntary.  Rippon (2014, 148), for example, tells us that:\n\n\n\n\u2026 because people in poverty often find themselves either\nindebted or in need of cash to meet their own basic needs and those of\ntheir families, they would predictably find themselves faced with\nsocial or legal pressure to pay the bills by selling their organs, if\nselling organs were permitted. So we would harm people in poverty by\nintroducing a legal market that would subject them to such\npressures.\n\nIt is difficult, he argues:\n\n\n\u2026 to see how regulation could prevent the kind of pressure in\nquestion, while still maintaining the organ supply. Suppose that a\nhigh minimum price for organs was set. This would prevent one sort of\nexploitation ... as everyone who sold an organ would be substantially\ncompensated for it. However, this would do nothing to address the\nproblem that some might sell their organs out of economic desperation,\nrather than out of a choice made free from external pressure.\n\nThe underlying argument here is that certain sorts of payment, or\npayment in certain circumstances, exert undue influence on a person's\ndecision (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2002). Accusations of undue\ninducement almost always occur in one of two different contexts. The\nfirst is where the \u2018victim\u2019 of the inducement is in\ndesperate need of money; the second is where the \u2018victim\u2019\nis not desperate, but is offered such a huge amount of money to\ndo X that doing X becomes almost irresistible.\nWilkinson terms these \u2018desperate offeree\u2019 cases and\n\u2018enormous offer\u2019 cases. One notable thing that these have\nin common is that there is a huge gap between the offeree's\nwelfare-level if s/he does not accept the offer, and her welfare-level\nif s/he does accept (Wilkinson 2003).\n\n\nIs valid consent possible in these cases? In both scenarios it\nmay be terrifically hard to decline. However this does not mean\nthat valid consent to the offer is impossible. Radcliffe Richards\n(2010, 291) makes the point as follows:\n\n\nIt does not normally occur to us that people coerced by circumstances\ninto doing things they would not otherwise do should have their consent\nregarded as invalid. If you have cancer, with the choice between\nrisking its unchecked progression and putting up with pretty nasty\ntreatments, nobody would think of arguing that the narrow range of\noptions made your consent to treatment invalid.\n\n\n\nSo even if we grant that the recipients of enormous offers and\ndesperate offerees will find it hard to refuse, this does not mean that\nthey cannot validly consent. This must be so. Otherwise, it would be\nimpossible for anyone ever to consent validly to lifesaving operations,\nnot to mention lottery \u2018jackpot\u2019 wins or large wage rises;\nthe mere fact that a proposal is tremendously attractive does not mean\nthat it cannot be voluntarily accepted.\n\n\nA slightly different tack is to invoke the idea of coercion by\ncircumstances, specifically coercion by poverty (Annas 1984; Rippon 2014;\nTorcello & Wear 2000). Thus, someone might argue that\neven though valid consent from \u2018desperate\u2019 people is\npossible in principle for the reasons just given, consent will normally\nbe invalid when the person consenting (e.g., to selling her kidney) is\ncoerced by poverty. The difference between coercion by poverty\nand Radcliffe Richards' cancer example is supposed to be that\nwhereas the cancer is a morally neutral natural occurrence, the poverty\n(at least in some cases) is the result of immoral acts and policies; it\nis unjust poverty.\n\n\nOne initial response to the \u2018coercion by poverty\u2019 refers\nus back to the fact that almost all defenders of organ sale are arguing\nnot for unfettered international trafficking in transplant organs but\nrather for a regulated system of compensation. Within the context\nof a regulated system (particularly that advocated by Erin and Harris,\nwhich would be limited to one economic area) there is no reason to\nbelieve that most organ sellers would be desperately poor. Organ\nsale may admittedly be more attractive to those with the least money\n(for why would someone rich need or want to sell an organ?) but then\nmuch the same can be said of some of the least sought-after and worst\npaid agricultural and cleaning jobs, and we do not generally say that\npeople cannot consent to do these or that these types of employment\nshould be banned.\n\n\nBut let us allow for the sake of argument that organ vendors would\nbe very poor. What would follow from this? Poverty (or\nthreatening poverty) can clearly be a method of coercion. An\nobvious example of this is the behaviour of exploitative employers\nduring times of high unemployment. They can threaten workers with\nunemployment\u2014and, hence, poverty\u2014if they do not comply\nwith their demands (Wilkinson 2003). The position of the\nprospective organ buyer though seems rather unlike that of the\nexploitative employer and, as Wilkinson and Moore (1999, 378) point\nout:\n\n\n\n\u2026 it is a necessary condition of an offer's being\ncoercive that the offerer is also responsible for the bad circumstances\nof the offeree. For example, if we poison you and then offer to provide\nthe only available antidote in exchange for your stamp collection, that\nis coercive. If you are poisoned in a way for which we are not\nresponsible, and we make the same offer, that is not coercive \u2026\nas long as those making an offer are not responsible for the\ncircumstances of the potential subjects, their offer is not\ncoercive.\n\n\n\nSo in order for prospective organ purchasers to be coercing through\npoverty, they must be responsible for the poverty. This need not\nmean that they caused the poverty, for people may be responsible for\n(improving or preventing) situations that they have not themselves\ncaused. Hence, another scenario in which the buyers may be\nresponsible is if they have a positive duty to rescue the prospective\nsellers from poverty (and \u2018for free\u2019 rather than in\nexchange for an organ).\n\n\nAn illuminating analogy is Nozick's Drowning Case\n(Nozick 1969, 449). This is a situation in which P (the occupant\nof a boat) offers to save Q (who is drowning close to the boat) but\nonly if Q promises to pay P $10,000 within three days of reaching\nshore. One view of this case is that P coerces Q (into paying) if and\nonly if P has a freestanding duty to save Q without reward.\nWhether P does in fact have such a duty is not something we need to\ndecide upon here and that will depend upon a wide range of facts about\nthe situation.\n\n\nOrgan vendors then are somewhat like the person in the boat.\nIf they have an independent duty to alleviate the poverty (i.e., a duty\nthat does not depend on their getting an organ in return) then to\ninsist on an organ for the money (when they should have been giving the\nmoney anyway) would be coercive. It would be like charging\nsomeone who would otherwise drown in a situation where there is a duty\nfreely to rescue.\n\n\nIt is not hard to see how, in principle, this style of coercion\nargument could work against organ sale. What is much harder is working\nout whether, in most of the cases envisaged, organ buyers have a duty\nto alleviate the poverty. The case most often discussed is where the\norgan purchaser is a rich Westerner and the vendor is someone\ndesperately poor from the developing world. The Westerner, it is said,\nuses poverty to \u2018force\u2019 (coerce) the poor person into\ngiving up the organ. This may be the case if the Westerner\nhas a duty to alleviate the prospective organ seller's poverty. But,\nas well as difficult general questions about global distributive\njustice and the like, there is also the question of whether the\nindividual in question is directly responsible for alleviating the\nother's poverty in these cases. The problem with attributing\nresponsibility to individual organ purchasers is that the extent to\nwhich they have a positive \u2018duty to rescue\u2019 those in dire\npoverty may vary enormously depending on their own positions of wealth\nand power, and on the extent to which they have already done virtuous\nthings in an attempt to act on their duties towards the poor.  For\nexample, a Western organ purchaser could have already devoted a large\npart of her income and time to charitable projects aimed at the\nalleviation of poverty and may herself have relatively little\nmoney\u2014just enough to buy a kidney. Do we really want to say that\nsuch a person has a duty to give her money to the prospective organ\nvendor without receiving the kidney (without which she may well die)\nin return?\n\n\nA more promising option is to focus on groups rather than\nindividuals. One might argue, for example, that the rich nations have a\nduty to alleviate poverty in the poor nations. With this (plausible)\nassumption in place, it could then be argued that when the rich nations\ncollectively offer the poor nations money (but only) in return for\norgans, this is not really an offer, but rather a threat (a threat to\nwrongfully withhold resources if they do not hand over organs).\nThe rich nations (it is argued) should be giving the money anyway, not\ndemanding organs in return for it. So what the rich nations are doing\nis threatening to withhold resources to which the poor nations have a\nmoral right, unless the poor nations hand over organs: a seemingly\nclear case of coercion.\n\n\nHowever, there is a further problem with the \u2018coercion by\npoverty\u2019 argument\u2014or at least there is a serious problem\nwith attempting to use it specifically as an argument for the legal\nprohibition of organ sale. The problem is that the argument works\nequally well against all trade between the rich nations and the poor\nones. For (in simplistic terms) if the rich nations have a duty to give\nresources to the poor nations, then any time that the rich nations\ninsist on trading rather than donating, they will be practicing\ncoercion\u2014threatening to withhold money that they should be\ngiving anyway, unless they are provided with goods of one sort or\nanother. And, as far as the coercion argument is concerned, there is no\nreason to single out the trade in organs for special treatment. This\nlooks like a decisive objection to the coercion argument. Either it\ndoes not work at all, or it works but \u2018proves too much\u2019 and\ngives us no reason to single out organ sale for condemnation and/or\nprohibition.\n\n\nOne possible reply to this is to make a distinction between forms of\nglobal trade which benefit developing world economies and societies\nand those which do not. One might then argue that a difference between\nthe organ trade and (say) the development of hi-tech manufacturing is\nthat only the latter has the potential to emancipate populations in\nthe longer-term, whereas buying an organ is merely a \u2018resource\ngrab\u2019 with no positive side-effects on socio-economic\ndevelopment. Like many of the other arguments discussed in this entry,\nmuch depends on the how the empirical evidence shapes up, but this\nresponse does seem to have some plausibility.  However, it could still\nbe claimed that the international organ trade is no worse (as far as\nthe quality of consent is concerned) than any other form of\ninternational trade which fails positively to contribute to long-term\ndevelopment. So perhaps the organ trade is (in this respect) on a par\nwith logging, or mining, or some basic forms of agriculture.\n\n\nPerhaps more importantly, though, we must remember that, in any\ncase, most of these concerns about coercion and poverty can be dealt\nwith by having a controlled system such as the Erin-Harris\nproposal. Of course it is not the case that there is no unfair\npoverty within the Western countries that they have in mind. And\nso, even under the Erin-Harris system, some account would have to be\ntaken of the coercion by poverty argument. Perhaps, for example,\nwe would want to say that, in order for the national organ purchasing\nagency not to be coercing-by-poverty it needs to be the case that there\nis a minimum wage law and a welfare state that are at least close to\nbeing fair, so that there is no poverty in society for which the state\nis morally responsible (either actively or by omission). This is\nprobably a lot to ask but then we must remember that any actual organ\nsale system, along with all other aspects of the economy, is unlikely\nto be perfect; and, provided that the organ sale system is not\nsubstantially more exploitative or harmful than most other widely\naccepted economic transactions then it would seem arbitrary and unfair\nto single it out for particular condemnation or prohibition.\n\n\nFinally, Radcliffe Richards offers an argument to the effect that\neven if there is a consent problem caused by \u2018coercion through\npoverty\u2019 (a claim about which she is sceptical) this is unlikely\nto be a sound basis for prohibiting sale. She asks us to\nconsider a case in which your daughter is kidnapped. The\nkidnappers ask for a ransom in return for your daughter's\nlife. Clearly, your consent to this arrangement (if forthcoming)\nwould be invalid because coerced. But\u2014\n\n\nSuppose the police appeared on the kidnapping scene and prevented you\nfrom signing the [ransom payment] document, perhaps with the outcome\nthat your child was shot. They might have good public policy\nreasons for doing this \u2026 but it would be preposterous for them\nto claim that they were doing it because the consent you were trying to\ngive would be invalid \u2026 [T]he whole point of declaring\ninvalidity is to protect the alleged consenter, and here the police\nwould actually be compounding the wrong done to you by constricting\nstill further the range of options already constricted by the\nkidnapper (Radcliffe Richards 2010, 294).\n\n\n\nAccording to Radcliffe Richards, this is analogous to the situation\nin which state action is used to prevent organ sale. As with the\nkidnapping, there may be legitimate reasons for such state action (for\nexample, if the police suspect that the organ purchaser's surgeon\nis planning to take several organs and then kill the organ\nvendor). However, the invalidity of the seller's consent\n(due to poverty) would not in and of itself be a sufficient reason for\nstate intervention in these circumstances.\n\n\nSince the metaphorical coercer (poverty) is still present, and the\nindividual is making the best choice among a still-constricted range of\noptions, disallowing the choice is like preventing you from meeting the\ndemands of the kidnapper while he still has your child\n(Radcliffe Richards 2010, 294).\n\n\n\nSo even if there is a quality of consent problem in these\norgan sale cases this is unlikely to justify prohibition.\n",
