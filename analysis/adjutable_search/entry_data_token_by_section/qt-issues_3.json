An element of convention\ncomes in when deciding how the operators representing observables at\ndifferent times are to be related.\n\nFor concreteness, suppose that have a system whose observables include\na position, \\(x\\), and momentum, \\(p\\), with respect to some\nframe of reference. There is a sense in which, for two distinct times,\n\\(t\\) and \\(t'\\), position at time \\(t\\) and\nposition at time \\(t'\\) are distinct observables, and also\na sense in which they are values, at different times, of the same\nobservable. Once we have settled on operators \\(\\hat{X}\\) and\n\\(\\hat{P}\\) to represent position and momentum at time \\(t\\), we\nstill have a choice of which operators represent the corresponding\nquantities at time \\(t.\\)  On the Schr\u00f6dinger\npicture, the same operators \\(\\hat{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{P}\\) are used\nto represent position and momentum, whatever time is considered.  As\nthe probabilities for results of experiments involving these\nquantities may be changing with time, different vectors must be used\nto represent the state at different times.\n\nThe equation of motion obeyed by a quantum state vector is the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. It is constructed by first forming\nthe operator \\(\\hat{H}\\)corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem, which represents the total energy of the system. The rate of\nchange of a state vector is proportional to the result of operating on\nthe vector with the Hamiltonian operator \\(\\hat{H}\\).\n\n\\[ i \\hbar {\\,\\D}/{\\D t}\\, \\ket{\\psi (t)} = \\hat{H} \\ket{\\psi (t)}. \\]\n\n\nThere is an operator that takes a state at time 0 into a state at time\n\\(t\\); it is given by \n\n\\[ U(t) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{{-}i H t}{\\hbar}\\right). \\]\n\n\nThis operator is a linear operator that implements a one-one mapping\nof the Hilbert space to itself that preserves the inner product of any\ntwo vectors; operators with these properties are called unitary\noperators, and, for this reason, evolution according to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation is called unitary evolution.\n\nFor our purposes, the most important features of this equation is that\nit is deterministic and linear. The state vector at\nany time, together with the equation, uniquely determines the state\nvector at any other time. Linearity means that, if two vectors\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(0)}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(0)}\\) evolve into vectors\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(t) }\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(t)}\\), respectively, then, if\nthe state at time 0 is a linear combination of these two, the state at\nany time \\(t\\) will be the corresponding linear\ncombination of \\(\\ket{\\psi_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(t)}\\).\n\\[ a\\ket{\\psi_{1}(0)} + b\\ket{\\psi_{2}(0)} \\rightarrow a\\ket{\\psi_{1}(t)} + b\\ket{\\psi_{2}(t)} . \\]\n\nThe Heisenberg picture, on the other hand, employs different operators\n\\(\\hat{X}(t)\\), \\(\\hat{X}(t')\\) for position, depending on the time\nconsidered (and similarly for momentum and other observables). If\n\\(\\hat{A}(t)\\)is a family of Heisenberg picture operators representing\nsome observable at different times, the members of the family \nsatisfy the Heisenberg equation of motion,\n\n\\[\ni \\hbar d/dt \\; \\hat{A}(t) = \\hat{A}(t) \\hat{H} - \\hat{H} \\hat{A}(t).\n\\]\n\n\nOne sometimes hears it said that, on the Heisenberg picture, the state\nof the system is unchanging. This is incorrect. It is true that there\nare not different state vectors corresponding to different times, but\nthat is because a single state vector serves for computing\nprobabilities for all observables pertaining to all times. These\nprobabilities do change with time.\n2.3.2. The collapse postulate\n\nAs mentioned, standard applications of quantum theory involve a\ndivision of the world into a system that is treated within quantum\ntheory, and the remainder, typically including the experimental\napparatus, that is not treated within the theory. Associated with this\ndivision is a postulate about how to assign a state vector after an\nexperiment that yields a value for an observable, according to which,\nafter an experiment, one replaces the quantum state with an eigenstate\ncorresponding to the value obtained.  Unlike the unitary\nevolution applied otherwise, this is a discontinuous change of the\nquantum state, sometimes referred to as collapse of the state\nvector, or state vector reduction. There are two\ninterpretations of the postulate about collapse, corresponding to two\ndifferent conceptions of quantum states. If a quantum state represents\nnothing more than knowledge about the system, then the collapse of the\nstate to one corresponding to an observed result can be thought of as\nmere updating of knowledge. If, however, quantum states represent\nphysical reality, in such a way that distinct pure states always\nrepresent distinct physical states of affairs, then the collapse\npostulate entails an abrupt, perhaps discontinuous, change of the\nphysical state of the system. Considerable confusion can arise if the\ntwo interpretations are conflated.\n\nThe collapse postulate occurs already in the general discussion at the\nfifth Solvay Conference in 1927 (see Bacciagaluppi and Valentini, 2009,\n437\u2013450). It is also found in Heisenberg\u2019s The\nPhysical Principles of the Quantum Theory, based on lectures\npresented in 1929 (Heisenberg, 1930a, 27; 1930b, 36). Von Neumann, in\nhis reformulation of quantum theory a few years later, distinguished\nbetween two types of processes: Process 1:, which occurs upon\nperformance of an experiment, and Process 2:, the unitary evolution\nthat takes place as long as no measurement is made (von Neumann, 1932;\n1955, \u00a7V.I). He does not take this distinction to be a difference\nbetween two physically distinct processes. Rather, the invocation of\none process or the other depends on a somewhat arbitrary division of\nthe world into an observing part and an observed part (see von\nNeumann,1932, 224; 1955, 420).\n\nThe collapse postulate does not appear in the first edition (1930) of\nDirac\u2019s Principles of Quantum Mechanics; it is\nintroduced in the second edition (1935). Dirac formulates it as\nfollows.\n\n\nWhen we measure a real dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\), the disturbance\ninvolved in the act of measurement causes a jump in the state of the\ndynamical system. From physical continuity, if we make a second\nmeasurement of the same dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\) immediately after\nthe first, the result of the second measurement must be the same as\nthat of the first. Thus after the first measurement has been made,\nthere is no indeterminacy in the result of the second. Hence, after\nthe first measurement has been made, the system is in an eigenstate of\nthe dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\), the eigenvalue it belongs to being\nequal to the result of the first measurement. This conclusion must\nstill hold if the second measurement is not actually made. In this way\nwe see that a measurement always causes the system to jump into an\neigenstate of the dynamical variable that is being measured, the\neigenvalue this eigenstate belongs to being equal to the result of the\nmeasurement (Dirac 1935: 36).\n\n\nUnlike von Neumann and Heisenberg, Dirac is treating the\n\u201cjump\u201d as a physical process.\n\nNeither von Neumann nor Dirac take awareness of the result by a\nconscious observer to be a necessary condition for collapse. For von\nNeumann, the location of the cut between the \u201cobserved\u201d\nsystem and the \u201cobserver\u201dis somewhat arbitrary. It may be\nplaced between the system under study and the experimental apparatus.\nOn the other hand, we could include the experimental apparatus in the\nquantum description, and place the cut at the moment when light\nindicating the result hits the observer\u2019s retina. We could also\ngo even further, and include the retina and relevant parts of the\nobserver\u2019s nervous system in the quantum system. That the cut\nmay be pushed arbitrarily far into the perceptual apparatus of the\nobserver is required, according to von Neumann, by the principle\nof psycho-physical parallelism.\n\nA formulation of a version of the collapse postulate according to\nwhich a measurement is not completed until the result is observed is\nfound in London and Bauer (1939). For them, as for Heisenberg, this is\na matter of an increase of knowledge on the part of the observer.\n\nWigner (1961) combined elements of the two interpretations. Like those\nwho take the collapse to be a matter of updating of belief in light of\ninformation newly acquired by an observer, he takes collapse to take\nplace when a conscious observer becomes aware of an experimental\nresult. However, like Dirac, he takes it to be a real physical\nprocess. His conclusion is that consciousness has an influence on the\nphysical world not captured by the laws of quantum mechanics. This\ninvolves a rejection of von Neumann\u2019s principle of\npsycho-physical parallelism, according to which it must be possible to\ntreat the process of subjective perception as if it were a physical\nprocess like any other.\n\nThere is a persistent misconception that, for von Neumann, collapse is\nto be invoked only when a conscious observer becomes aware of the\nresult. As noted, this is the opposite of his view, as the cut may be\nplaced between the observed system and the experimental apparatus, and\nit is for him an important point that the location of the cut be\nsomewhat arbitrary. In spite of this, von Neumann\u2019s position is\nsometimes conflated with Wigner\u2019s speculative proposal, and\nWigner\u2019s proposal is sometimes erroneously referred to as the\nvon Neumann-Wigner interpretation.\n\nNone of the standard formulations are precise about when the collapse\npostulate is to be applied; there is some lee-way as to what is to\ncount as an experiment, or (for versions that require reference to an\nobserver) what is to count as an observer. Some, including von Neumann\nand Heisenberg, have taken it to be a matter of principle that there\nbe some arbitrariness in where to apply the postulate. It is common\nwisdom that, in practice, this arbitrariness is innocuous. The rule of\nthumb that seems to be applied, in practice, in setting the split\nbetween the parts of the world treated quantum-mechanically and things\ntreated as classical objects has been formulated by J. S. Bell as,\n\u201c[w]hen in doubt enlarge the quantum system,\u201d to the point\nat which including more in the quantum system makes negligible\ndifference to practical predictions (Bell 1986, 362; Bell 2004, 189).\nIf anything is to be counted as \u201cstandard\u201d quantum\nmechanics, it is the operational core we have discussed, supplemented\nby a heuristic rule of application of this sort. Standard quantum\nmechanics works very well.  If, however, one seeks a theory that is\ncapable of describing all systems, including macroscopic ones, and can\nyield an account of the process by which macroscopic events, including\nexperimental outcomes, come about, this gives rise to the so-called\n\u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, which we will discuss after we have\nintroduced the notion of entanglement (see \n section 3).\n2.3.3. Wave functions\n\nAmong the Hilbert-space representations of a quantum theory are\nwave-function representations.\n\nAssociated with any observable is its spectrum, the range of\npossible values that the observable can take on.  Given any\nphysical system and any observable for that system, one can always\nform a Hilbert-space representation for the quantum theory of that\nsystem by considering complex-valued functions on the spectrum of that\nobservable.  The set of such functions form a vector space. Given\na measure on the spectrum of the observable, we can form a Hilbert space\nout of the set of complex-valued square-integrable functions on the\nspectrum by treating functions that differ only on a set of zero\nmeasure as equivalent (that is, the elements of our Hilbert space are\nreally equivalence classes of functions), and by using the measure to\ndefine an inner product (see\n entry on Quantum Mechanics\n if this terminology is unfamiliar).\n\nIf the spectrum of the chosen observable is a continuum (as it is, for\nexample, for position or momentum), a Hilbert-space representation of\nthis sort is called a wave function representation, and the\nfunctions that represent quantum states, wave functions (also\n\u201cwave-functions,\u201d or \u201cwavefunctions\u201d). The\nmost familiar representations of this form are position-space wave\nfunctions, which are functions on the set of possible configurations\nof the system, and momentum-space wave functions, which are functions\nof the momenta of the systems involved.\n",
