    "main_text": "Psychoanalysis and Utopian Vision || The Historical and Social Nature of Human Drives\n4.1 The Historical and Social Nature of Human Drives\n\n\nPsychoanalysis was an essential theoretical tool for the Frankfurt\nSchool from the beginning. When Max Horkheimer took over as director\nin 1931, he had already been influenced by psychoanalysis (Abromeit\n2011: 192\u2013195). Soon after becoming director he brought\nPsychoanalyst Erich Fromm on board. The initial goal was to use\npsychoanalytic theory to understand the psyche of the working\nclass. That is, the goal was to understand why those who would benefit\nmost from a revolution of social change seemed to resist it. Marcuse\ndid not engage psychoanalysis until later. Although he made the\nsame use of psychoanalysis as his colleagues, Marcuse also developed\nhis own unique approach to interpreting psychoanalytic\ntheory. While Eros and Civilization is a work on Freud and is\nreplete with the language of psychoanalysis, it is as Marxian as it is\nFreudian. The name Marx it not mentioned in the text, and rarely\nare Marxian categories be introduced. Nevertheless, the Freudian\ncategories are bent toward a Marxist/Marxian type of analysis of\nadvanced industrial societies.\n\nAlthough Marcuse had read Freud in the 1920s and 1930s, his serious\nengagement did not begin until the 1950s. Marcuse was invited to give\na series of lectures in 1950\u201351 by the Washington School of\nPsychiatry. The result of this engagement was one of Marcuse\u2019s\nmost famous books, Eros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry\ninto Freud. Marcuse\u2019s book is a response to the pessimism\nof Freud\u2019s Civilization and its Discontents (1930\n[1961]). Freud\u2019s book paints a bleak picture of the evolution of\ncivilization as the evolution of greater and greater repression from\nwhich there seems to be no escape. The death and life instincts are\nengaged in a battle for dominance with no clear winner in\nsight. According to Marcuse, Freud fails to develop the emancipatory\npossibility of his own theory. Marcuse\u2019s task is\ntwo-fold. First, he must show that human instincts or drives are not\nmerely biological and fixed, but also social, historical, and\nmalleable. Secondly, he must show that repressive society also\nproduces the possibility of the abolition of repression (Marcuse 1955: 5). \n\nThat the instincts can be repressed already suggests that society and\nits form of organization play a role in shaping the instincts. \nIf this is the case, the instincts cannot be fixed. As society\nand its mechanisms of repression change, so does the instincts. \nMarcuse claims that:\n\n The vicissitudes of the instincts are the vicissitudes of the\nmental apparatus in civilization. The animal drive become human\ninstincts under the influence of the external reality. (Marcuse 1955: 11\u201312)\n\n\nIn this transformation of the animal drives into human instincts there\nis a transformation of the pleasure principle into the reality\nprinciple (Marcuse 1955: 12). In Civilization and its\nDiscontents Freud claimed it was the program of the pleasure\nprinciple that decided the purpose of life (Freud 1961 [1930]:\n25). However, the external world does not conform to the dictates of\nthe pleasure principle and is even hostile toward it. Hence, the\npleasure principle reverts, turns inward, is repressed. \n\nFor Marcuse, liberation means a freeing up of the pleasure\nprinciple. However, he realizes that if human beings are to\nco-exist, some degree of repression is necessary. That is, if one\nacted simply according to the demands of the pleasure principle, this\nwould lead to an infringement on the freedom of others. Hence,\nthere has to be a mutual limiting of freedom and happiness if we are to\nco-exist. It is with regards to this problem that Marcuse comes\nup with one of his most creative modifications of Freud\u2019s\ntheory. \n",
