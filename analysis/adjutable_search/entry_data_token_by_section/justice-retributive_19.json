    "main_text": "The Question of Justification\n5. The Question of Justification\n\nThe principal focus of concern when it comes to justifying\nretributivism is justifying its desert object. The question is: if we\ncan assume that the institutions of punishment can be justified all\nthings considered, can we justify the claim that wrongdoers deserve\ncensure and hard treatment?\n\nCensure is surely the easier of the two. It respects the wrongdoer as\na responsible agent to censure her, and it respects the victim (if\nthere is one) to stand up for her as someone whose rights should have\nbeen respected. The core challenge for justifying retributivism, then,\nis justifying the claim that hard treatment is equally deserved.\n\nAs Michael Moore (1997: 106) points out, there are two general\nstrategies for justifying retributive hard treatment: (1) showing how\nsuch treatment \u201cfollows from some yet more general principle of\njustice that we think to be true\u201d, and (2) showing that it fits\nwith a theory of punishment that \u201cbest accounts for those of our\nmore particular judgments that we also believe to be true\u201d.\nThese will be handled in reverse order.\n",
