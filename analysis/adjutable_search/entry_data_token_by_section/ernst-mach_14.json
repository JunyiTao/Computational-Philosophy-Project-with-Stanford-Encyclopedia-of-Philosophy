    "main_text": "Physics || Measurement\n5.2 Measurement\n\n\nThis brings us to the problem of measurement. Normally\nwhen we measure an interval we believe we are indeed measuring space or\ntime. However, measurement relies upon comparison.\nThis was important for Mach: we do not measure \u2018space\u2019, but\nrather we compare our spatial sensations. All measurement\nrequires the use of a standard, and since any standard we pick is of\nthe same nature as the thing we are measuring, we do not truly measure\nanything (if by this we mean an absolute measurement):\n\n\nBut we do not measure mere space; we require a material standard of\nmeasurement, and with this the whole system of manifold sensations is\nbrought back again. It is only intuitional sense-presentations that can\nlead to the formulation of the equations of physics, and it is\nprecisely in such presentations that the interpretation of these\nequations consists. Thus, though the equations only contain\nspatial numerical measurements, these measurements, also, are merely\nthe ordering principle which tells us out of what members of the series\nof sensational elements we have to construct our picture of the\nworld. [AS: 343]\n\n\nWhen we measure the spatial dimensions of an object, we are comparing\nit to an agreed upon standard. Ultimately all standards must have\ntheir root in physiological comparison. In this way Mach tries to\nbring physics back into psychology. Physics is based upon\nmeasurements, but measurements are ultimately physiological\ncomparisons. According to Mach, physics can never escape its\nbiological origins. Planck and Einstein accepted Mach\u2019s critique of\nthe old physics, that it was under the spell of concepts which were\nderivative of unreflective development, but rejected Mach\u2019s claim that\nphysics was stuck, so to speak, in psychology.\n",
