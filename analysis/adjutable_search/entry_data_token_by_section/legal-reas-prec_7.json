    "main_text": "The Justifications for Precedent || Expectations\n3.2 Expectations\n\n\nAnother common argument in favour of precedent is in terms of\nprotecting expectations: if an institution has dealt with an issue in\none way in the past, then that creates the expectation that it will do\nso in the future\u2014an expectation which people use to plan their\nlives and enjoy some control over their\n situations.[15] \n So there are good reasons for an institution to follow its previous\ndecisions (other things being equal), even if it turns out that they\nwere mistaken.\n\n\nThe fundamental problem with this line of argument in the case of\nprecedent is that it suffers from a type of circularity. It is true\nthat legal systems that follow a practice of precedent create\nexpectations that earlier decisions will be followed in the\nfuture. But it is important to bear in mind that it is only\nlegitimate expectations which need to be considered in\ndecision-making, not any expectation which someone forms. The mere\nfact that a decision was made in the past provides no reason in itself\nto expect that it will be followed in the future, and certainly\ncreates no entitlement to expect that it will be followed. That a\ncompany orders stationery from a supplier at the start of the year may\nraise a hope, and even possibly an expectation, that it will do so\nagain later in the year, but the supplier does not have a\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 expectation that it will do so, and the\ncompany does not create a precedent for itself. Where there\nis an institutional practice of following past decisions, on\nthe other hand, the reliance of those subject to future decisions may\nground legitimate expectations, but it is always open to the\ninstitution to announce that it will no longer treat past decisions as\nbinding and will, instead, decide each case on its merits.  Equally,\nit is a common occurrence in some institutional settings where past\ndecisions are followed for a decision to be made subject to\nthe proviso that it is \u2018not setting a precedent\u2019 for the\nfuture. \n\n\nWhether a past decision creates legitimate expectations, therefore,\ndepends upon there being good independent reasons for the institution\nto follow its earlier decisions, or upon the existence of a practice\nof doing so. But the practice itself should only be maintained if\nthere are good independent reasons for having it: its mere existence\ncannot bootstrap a justification for the maintenance of the\npractice.\n",
