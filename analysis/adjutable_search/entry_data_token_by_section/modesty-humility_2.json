    "main_text": "Modesty and Humility || Key Features\n1.2 Key Features\n\n\nModesty has several key features that theoretical accounts aim to\ncapture. These are explicitly stated in Driver (1989 and 2001) and are\ntaken up in most work on modesty since then.\n\nDependent Virtue: Slote (1983, 61ff) notes that\nmodesty is a dependent virtue. One is modest about something\nelse that is good, about their success or intelligence. In this sense,\nmodesty requires the existence of another good quality. This is\ntypically taken to be something objectively good rather than simply\nsomething that the person thinks is good, though most views\ncan accommodate either intuition. Most views assume that the good\nquality in question is a good quality of the person who is modest,\nthough Bommarito (2013, 94) broadens the scope to allow modesty about\nthe good qualities in others when they reflect on us, as when one is\nmodest about the achievements of their child, nation, or local sports\nteams. Others, such as Ben-Ze\u2019ev (1993) and Um (forthcoming), go\nfurther and deny that modesty is a dependent virtue at all.\n\nFalse Modesty: Theories of modesty also need to be\nable to distinguish modesty from false modesty. That is, some people\nwho are not modest can act as if they are. This rules out accounts of\nmodesty that are entirely behavioral. If being modest is simply a\nmatter of certain external behaviors, then there would be no way to\ndistinguish modesty from false modesty. Modesty and humility require\ncertain mental states in addition to overt behaviors.\n\nSelf-Attribution Strangeness: Self-predications of\nmodesty and humility are, at least in general, self-undermining. This\nis highlighted by Sorensen (1988, 120ff) and Driver (1989, 375) who\nnote that the sentence \u201cI am modest\u201d is a distinctly\nimmodest thing to say. Though Raterman (2006, 232) and\nBommarito (2013, 113) describe contexts in which saying \u201cI am\nmodest\u201d is not self-undermining, self-ascriptions of modesty are,\nin general, self-undermining. It is important to note that this need\nnot be about public utterances; a person seems less modest for\nthinking about how modest they are. Bernard Williams, for\nexample, writes that \u201c\u2026 it is a notorious truth that a\nmodest person does not act under the title of modesty\u201d (1993,\n10). That is, a modest person does not think of themselves as acting\nmodestly, while a just person typically does think of themselves as\nacting justly.\n",
