    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn June 1899, at a ceremony marking the installation of the new\nGauss-Weber monument in G\u00f6ttingen, David Hilbert delivered a\nlecture on the foundations of geometry. Published later that year by\nTeubner under the title \u201cGrundlagen der\nGeometrie\u201d (\u201cFoundations of Geometry\u201d), the\npiece stands as a watershed in the development of modern mathematics\nand logic. Though the subject-matter of the work is geometry, its\nlasting influence concerns more broadly the role of axioms in\nmathematical theories, and the systematic treatment of such\nmetatheoretical questions as consistency and independence. By\npresenting a rich trove of consistency and independence\ndemonstrations, Hilbert displays here the power of the\n\u201cformal\u201d approach to axioms, and lays the groundwork for\nwhat soon becomes our own contemporary model-theoretic approach to\nformal systems. (For the historical background to Hilbert\u2019s\ntreatment of axioms, see Hallett 2012 and\n Nineteenth Century Geometry;\n for the role of Hilbert\u2019s work in the development of model\ntheory, see\n model theory\n and Eder & Schiemer 2018.)\n\nHilbert\u2019s lecture and monograph inspired a sharp reaction from\nhis contemporary Gottlob Frege, who found both Hilbert\u2019s\nunderstanding of axioms, and his approach to consistency and\nindependence demonstrations, virtually incomprehensible and at any\nrate seriously flawed. Frege\u2019s reaction is first laid out in his\ncorrespondence with Hilbert from December 1899 to September 1900, and\nsubsequently in two series of essays (both entitled \u201cOn the\nFoundations of Geometry\u201d) published in 1903 and 1906. Hilbert\nwas never moved by Frege\u2019s criticisms, and did not respond to\nthem after 1900. Frege, for his part, was never convinced of the\nreliability of Hilbert\u2019s methods, and held until the end that\nthe latter\u2019s consistency and independence proofs were fatally\n flawed.[1]\n\n\nIn this philosophical debate between the two mathematicians, we see a\nclash between two quite different ways of understanding the nature of\nmathematical theories and of their justification. The difference of\nopinion over the success of Hilbert\u2019s consistency and\nindependence proofs is, as detailed below, the result of significant\ndifferences of opinion over such fundamental issues as: how to\nunderstand the content of a mathematical theory, what a successful\naxiomatization consists in, what the \u201ctruths\u201d of a\nmathematical theory really are, and finally, what one is really asking\nwhen one asks about the consistency of a set of axioms or the\nindependence of a given mathematical statement from others.\n\nIn what follows, we look briefly at Hilbert\u2019s technique in\nFoundations of Geometry, detail Frege\u2019s various\ncriticisms thereof, and finally outline the overall conceptions of\nlogic that give rise to the differences.\n",
