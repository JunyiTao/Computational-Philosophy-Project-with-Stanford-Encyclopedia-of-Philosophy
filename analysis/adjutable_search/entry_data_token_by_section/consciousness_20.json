    "main_text": "The functional question: Why does consciousness exist?\n6. The functional question: Why does consciousness exist?\n\n\nThe functional or Why question asks about the\nvalue or role or consciousness and thus indirectly\nabout its origin. Does it have a function, and if so what\nis it? Does it make a difference to the operation of systems in which\nit is present, and if so why and how? If consciousness exists as a\ncomplex feature of biological systems, then its adaptive value is\nlikely relevant to explaining its evolutionary origin, though of course\nits present function, if it has one, need not be the same as that it\nmay have had when it first arose. Adaptive functions often change over\nbiological time. Questions about the value of consciousness also have a\nmoral dimension in at least two ways. We are inclined to\nregard an organism's moral status as at least partly determined by the\nnature and extent to which it is conscious, and conscious states,\nespecially conscious affective states such as pleasures and pains, play\na major role in many of the accounts of value that underlie moral\ntheory (Singer 1975).\n\n\nAs with the What and How questions, the Why question poses a general\nproblem that subdivides into a diversity of more specific inquiries. In\nso far as the various sorts of consciousness, e.g., access, phenomenal,\nmeta-mental, are distinct and separable\u2014which remains an open\nquestion\u2014they likely also differ in their specific roles and\nvalues. Thus the Why question may well not have a single or uniform\nanswer.\n",
