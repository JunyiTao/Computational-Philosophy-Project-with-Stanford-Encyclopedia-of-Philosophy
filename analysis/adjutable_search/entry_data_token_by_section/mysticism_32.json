    "main_text": "Mysticism and Morality\n12. Secular Mysticism\n\nThe new scientific interest in meditation (especially mindfulness),\nthe new cultural interest in meditating for limited psychological or\nphysiological benefits rather than transforming one\u2019s entire\ncharacter, and the utilization of psychedelics in psychotherapy have\ngiven rise today to a new phenomenon \u2014 \u201csecular mysticism.\u201d Awe\nand wonder at nature is prominent, but this mysticism is not a matter\nof \u201cnature mysticism\u201d or of aesthetic experiences as possible\ntriggers of mystical experiences. Rather, the interest is in the\npsycho-physiological effects of meditation and psychedelics, with\nmystical experiences understood within a naturalist framework.\nNeuroscience appears to validate the positive effects of meditation\nand psychedelics on our well-being. Secular forms of meditation for\nlimited benefits, such as Jon Kabat-Zinn\u2019s\nmindfulness-based stress reduction program. Secularists can disconnect\ntraditional practices from a mystical tradition (e.g.,\nBatchelor\u2019s \u201csecular Buddhism\u201d [2015]) or focus only on\nlimited practices (e.g., Harris 2014, Letheby 2017).\n\nMysticism becomes \u201cnaturalized.\u201d It is reduced from a full way of life\nto eliciting mystical experiences for limited benefits or as mere\nrecreation. Mystical experiences break the sense of a narrow\n\u201cself\u2019\u201d and makes one feel connected to others and the rest of\nthe world, and secularists see this in terms of the natural world\nalone. This naturalist spirituality appears more tied to mystical\nexperiences than other psychedelic experiences (Letheby 2021, 200).\nPatients often attach great spiritual importance to mystical\nexperiences even if their metaphysics remains naturalist (see\nGriffiths 2011). Mystical experiences often touch off awe and wonder\nat the universe and being alive and also an interest in the \u201cbig\nquestions\u201d of philosophy and science even if the experiences\nthemselves are not taken to be cognitive. That mystical\nexperiences may involve transcendent realities or may give knowledge\nof reality is either denied in favor of a naturalist metaphysics,\nor the issue is simply ignored. In fact, while mystical experiences\nare normally seen in terms of transcendent realities, these\nexperiences may lead those inclined toward naturalism to becoming\nconvinced that there is no god or life after death and to abandoning\nreligion entirely (Newberg and Waldman 2016, 60, 67\u201381).\n\nSecular mysticism raises three central philosophical questions. First,\nit impacts the epistemological question of whether mystical\nexperiences give any insight into reality or other knowledge. If the\nexperiences do not necessarily lead to cognitive claims, we have to\nask whether mystics\u2019 knowledge-claims come only from their\ntradition and ask what role mystical experiences actually play. The\nissue of whether mystical experiences have any epistemic or\nontological implications becomes clearer. Second, it highlights\nthe issue of the role of cultural interpretation in understanding\nmystical experiences and the constructivist claim that cultural\ninfluences penetrate some or all mystical experiences. Third, can the\neffect of mystical experiences lead to a meaningful or purposeful life\nwithout reference to transcendent realities?\n",
