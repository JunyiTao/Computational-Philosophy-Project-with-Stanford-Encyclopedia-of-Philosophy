    "main_text": "The Linguistic Argument || Second Group of Objections\n4.3 Second Group of Objections\n\nAmong those engaging with the linguistic argument, many have objected\nthat it fails to adequately capture the truth conditions of\nknowledge-how ascriptions (Roberts 2009; Brogaard 2009, 2011;\nMichaelis 2011; Bengson & Moffett 2011a; Ginzburg 2011; Abbott\n2013; Santorio 2016; Hornsby 2016). Some have argued against the claim\nthat knowledge-wh is a matter of knowing a proposition that answers a\nquestion (Semantics for knowledge-wh). For example,\nCarr (1979, 1981) argues that when you know how to do something, you\nhave an attitude that essentially takes an act as its object. But when\nyou know that something is the case, you have an attitude that\nessentially takes a proposition as its object. Yet, intellectualists\nmight reply that knowledge-how might be an attitude towards an act\nin virtue of being an attitude towards a proposition about\nthat act. \n\nOthers have questioned whether the complement \u201cwhich team is\nwinning\u201d in \u201cS knows which team is winning\u201d\nis, semantically, just like an interrogative (Brogaard 2009, 2011;\nGinzburg 1995a, 1995b, 1996, 2011; Ginzburg & Sag 2000). One\nargument against this assumption is that, if, e.g., \u201cwhich team\nis winning\u201d denoted a question, we would expect it to co-refer\nwith \u201cthe question of which team is winning\u201d. Yet we\ncannot substitute such expression-pairs salva veritate.\nSuppose Jenny knows/discovered/revealed an interesting question and\nsuppose the interesting question discovered by Jenny is \u201cwho\nleft yesterday?\u201d. Even so, it does not follow that Jenny\nknows/discovered/revealed who left yesterday. A response to this\nobjection might be that these examples exploit a subtle equivocation\n(Stanley 2011b: ch. 2, following King 2002). Consider \u201cJamaal\ndiscovered a new element\u201d. In it, \u201cdiscovered\u201d\ndenotes a relation between Jamaal and an object, a chemical element.\nOn the other hand, in the sentence \u201cJamaal discovered who left\nyesterday\u201d, \u201cdiscovered\u201d denotes a different\nrelation, one that holds between Jamaal and something of a different\nsort, namely, the proposition answering the question expressed by\n\u201cwho left yesterday\u201d. It is this second relation which is\nrelevant for the intellectualist. This is supported by the fact that\nthe \u201c[t]he former relation would be expressed in German by\n\u2018kennen\u2019, and the latter by\n\u2018wissen\u2019\u201d (Stanley 2011b: 66). (For more\nrelevant discussion, see Parent 2014.)\n\nOthers have questioned Logical form\u2014the claim\nthat in knowledge-how ascriptions, the embedded complement is an\ninterrogative. Objectualists claim that the complement of\nknowledge-how ascriptions (\u201chow to \u03a6\u201d) is not an\ninterrogative but an \u201cobjectual\u201d complement\u2014one\ndenoting ways to \u03a6 instead of propositions representing these ways\n(Bengson & Moffett 2011a). Objectualism is motivated by the\nconsideration that \u201cknowing how to \u03a6\u201d seems to be\nequivalent to \u201cknowing a way to \u03a6\u201d in pretty much\nevery context and by the apparent gradability of\n\u201cknows-how\u201d ascriptions (cf.\n section 3).\n An objectual semantics is in a good place to explain the gradability\nof knowledge-how ascriptions, since objectual knowledge ascriptions\nalso permit degree modifiers\u2014one can have partial knowledge of\nParis, or know Paris better than someone else. Along similar lines,\nBach (2012) and Abbott (2013) argue that in knowledge-how ascriptions\n\u201chow to \u03a6\u201d might work as a free relative. A\nfree relative is a wh-phrase that denotes an individual. So for\nexample, \u201cwhat I was given for dinner\u201d can be used as an\ninterrogative in \u201cI asked what I was given for dinner\u201d but\nalso as a free relative in \u201cI ate what I was given for\ndinner\u201d. In the latter ascription, it denotes some food that was\ngiven to me for dinner. In that sense, \u201chow to \u03a6\u201d\naccording to this proposal, in \u201cS knows how to\n\u03a6\u201d should be interpreted as a free relative denoting a way\nto \u03a6, rather than an answer to the question \u201chow to\n\u03a6?\u201d \n\nTo this proposal, some respond that knowledge-how ascriptions do not\npass the standard tests for detecting free relative complements\n(Schaffer 2009: 486\u201391; Habgood-Coote 2018a). Take the\ncoordinated use of knowledge-how and other knowledge-wh ascriptions in\n\u201cS has always known how to swim and never has wondered\nhow\u201d. This coordination suggests that both kinds of ascriptions\nhave an interrogative as a complement (Bresnan & Grimshaw 1978:\n332; M. Baker 1996: 204\u20137). Further, knowledge-how ascriptions\ncan be extended to embed a multiple interrogative, as in \u201cMark\nknows how to do what?\u201d , whereas free relative complements do\nnot tolerate multiple wh-phrases (C. Baker 1968; Bresnan &\nGrimshaw 1978: 335). Moreover, infinitival wh phrases, such as\n\u201cwhat to do\u201d, \u201chow to do\u201d, \u201cwho to\nask\u201d never allow for free relative reading (Huddleston &\nPullum 2002: 1070\u20133). Finally, a standard test for telling apart\nfree relatives and interrogatives is to see if they embed under\n\u201cbelieve\u201d, for \u201cbelieve\u201d does not take\ninterrogatives as complements but it does tolerate free relatives.\n(For example, \u201cMark believed who was charged guilty\u201d\ncannot mean \u201cMark believed the answer to the question \u201cWho\nwas charged guilty?\u201d\u201d. Rather, it means that Mark believed\nthe person who was charged guilty.) However, interestingly,\n\u201cbelieve\u201d can never embed infinitival constructions such\nas \u201cwhat to do\u201d, \u201chow to do\u201d, or \u201cwho to\nask\u201d. \n\nFinally, some have questioned whether Semantics for\nknowledge-wh applies to ascriptions embedding infinitival\ncomplements, like knowledge-how ascriptions. Roberts (2009) argues\nthat, as opposed to other wh complements, the meaning of\n\u201chow\u201d denotes a property rather than a proposition when\nembedded in infinitival clauses. Santorio (2016) defends a Gibbardian\nsemantics for knowledge ascriptions embedding infinitive\ninterrogatives, on which these ascriptions ascribe maximal performance\nplans compatible with an agent\u2019s plans (for more objections to\nSemantics for knowledge-wh, see also Sgaravatti &\nZardini 2008 and George 2013).\n",
