    "main_text": "Epistemology and Philosophy of Language: The Treasury of Reasoning || Introduction to the Work\n2.1 Introduction to the Work\n\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s Treasury of Epistemological\n Reasoning[2]\n is one of Tibet\u2019s best known and most consequential\nphilosophical achievements, roundly extolled as a work of genius and\nvalidation of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s reputation as an emanation of\nMa\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b, the bodhisattva of wisdom. It is an\nunrivaled touchstone for Tibetan approaches to concept formation,\nphilosophy of language, cognition and perception. Still, the work has\nan ambiguous legacy. Like the Three Vows, it was mired in\ncontroversy from its debut\u2014controversy around a number of its\nstridently combative positions, but especially, and without end,\ncontroversy around its meaning. What\u2019s more, at least some of\nits advocates were false friends, appropriating the glow of\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s legacy while making only selective use of the\nwork\u2019s masterful exposition of Dharmak\u012brti and, especially,\nturning a blind eye to crucial particulars that might call into\nquestion their own cherished\n doctrines.[3]\n Recent scholarship has begun to reveal the work\u2019s own goals and\nplace it within its intellectual contexts, but the project is complex\nand ongoing. This section is, of necessity, only a sketch.\n\nThe Treasury is staunchly anti-realist about both cognitive\nand linguistic objects. Nominalism and pragmatism are hardly outside\nthe range of expectation for a Buddhist. Yet Tibetans both before and\nafter Sapa\u1e47 (esp. Chapa before, Tsongkhapa after) have tended to\nhew to a more intuitive and \u201cmoderate\u201d realism\u2014to\nuse Georges Dreyfus\u2019 terminology (1997). Sapa\u1e47 defends a\nposition that is more spare and more severe than most Tibetan\nepistemologists, and, according to modern scholarship, closer to\n Dharmak\u012brti.[4]\n Buddhist traditions are widely known for their insistence that\nordinary beings are uniformly deluded and reality seen correctly by a\nBuddha is entirely beyond their (our) ken, so the counter-intuitive\nnature of anti-realism is not at all discomforting to the Indic\nBuddhist mainstream. Sapa\u1e47 certainly considered his own views\nmore accurate and more authentically Indian than those of his Tibetan\nadversaries. This self-understanding was, no doubt, buttressed by the\nfact that he had studied Sanskrit and Indian linguistic sciences with\nthe followers of the Kashmiri scholar\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra and that with\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b he had retranslated, and thereby\nrejuvenated the study of, Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika. Association with great\nIndian pa\u1e47\u1e0ditas gave Sapa\u1e47 the confidence\nto distinguish his own conservative stance from ideas he disparagingly\ncalled \u201cTibetan\u201d innovations.\n\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s main adversaries in his Treasury were\nadherents of the tradition of Ngok (rngog lugs) centered in\nSangpu (gsang-phu) monastery, whose most prominent advocates\nwere Ngog Lotsawa himself and his disciple Chapa Chokyi Senge. As\nChapa\u2019s epistemology gained ascendancy, study of the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika was apparently eclipsed by\nthat of other writings of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s (primarily the\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u1e63caya), and this perhaps had the\neffect of these thinkers losing sight of the key Buddhist\nphilosophical ingredient for a strong anti-realist view: concept\nformation via exclusion\n (any\u0101poha).[5]\n Whatever the cause, the significance of this piece of Buddhist\nepistemology seems to have been missed or downplayed by Chapa and his\n followers.[6]\n Sapa\u1e47\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\nrenaissance helped to bring the doctrine of apoha back into\nthe center of Buddhist epistemology and thereby resisted the rising\ntide of moderate realism. The great Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419), more\nthan a century later, rejuvenated moderate realism in Tibet through a\nnew synthesis of epistemology with Madhyamaka.\n",
