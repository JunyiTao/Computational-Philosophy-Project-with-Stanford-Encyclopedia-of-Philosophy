    "main_text": "Arguments in the Age of Materialism || Empirical Considerations\n3.5 Empirical Considerations\n\nThere are some empirical results that engage epiphenomenalism in\nseveral ways. These empirical results do not cut as deeply as the\nforegoing arguments, for they do not claim to show that consciousness\nis completely inefficacious. In particular, they do not show, and are\nnot aimed at showing, that episodes of consciousness do not causally\ncontribute to reports of such episodes. They suggest instead that the\nreported consciousness is not causally related to our nonlinguistic\nbehavior in ways that we ordinarily suppose.\n\nAn early and very well known argument derives from the work of B.\nLibet (1985, 2004). Libet asked participants in his experiments to\nmake an unplanned movement when they felt the urge to do so, and to\nreport (using a specially designed clock-like instrument) the time\nwhen they felt the urge to move. Recordings of participants\u2019\nbrain waves were made during these experiments, and Libet found a\nsignal (the \u201creadiness potential\u201d, RP) that correlated\nwith the movements. The key finding was that (after allowing for\ncorrections due to neural transmission times) the RP occurred about\n350 ms earlier than the time that participants reported having the\nurge to move. Libet himself allowed for the possibility of a veto\nafter the urge that would block the movement. However, many have drawn\nan implication that the conscious urge to make a movement comes too\nlate to causally contribute to a movement that has already been\ninitiated by brain processes (that were detected by the RP\nmeasurement). A corollary of this implication is that, to the extent\nwe have an intuition that our urge to move caused the movement, we are\nsubject to a causal illusion. The possibility of causal illusion, in\nturn, weakens the intuitive argument against epiphenomenalism\nexplained in section 2.1 above.\n\nMore recently, work led by J-D. Haynes (2013; see also Soon, et\nal. 2008) has found brain events that are somewhat correlated\nwith decisions, and that occur several seconds before the decision is\nmade. This work seems unsettling for the following reason. If we\nbelieve we were weighing options on a matter that was still open at,\nsay, one second before our conscious decision, but our action was\nalready predictable from neural events before that, then we would be\nunder some illusion about the extent to which our conscious decision\nhas an effect on our behavior.\n\nWork by Wegner and Wheatley (1999), Wegner (2002), and Linser and\nGoschke (2007), describes participants who have judged themselves to\nhave partial control of movements over which they in fact lacked\ncontrol. But if we can demonstrably have illusions about being in\ncontrol, our sense of being in control of our actions cannot be taken\nas evidence that our conscious intentions actually have effects in our\n(nonlinguistic) behavior. Such illusions further imply that we\nsometimes lack knowledge of the actual course of causation of our\nactions. (For discussion of conscious control, see also Oakley and\nHalligan 2017.)\n\nIn well-regarded studies, Nisbett and Wilson (1977a, 1977b) showed\nthat people sometimes confabulate, that is, they give reasons for\nevaluative judgments that do not reflect the actual causes of making\nthose judgments. This work again carries two implications: that people\nare sometimes mistaken in accepting efficacy of what they believe to\nbe their reasons for a judgment, and that they are sometimes mistaken\nabout the real reasons for their behavior.\n\nThe implications drawn from these experiments have been criticized on\nseveral grounds. In some cases, there are technical criticisms of\nmethods or statistical analyses (see Dennett, 1991 for critique of\nLibet\u2019s conclusions, and S. Walter\u2019s 2014 discussion of\nthe Wegner and Wheatley (1999) experiment; for defense of Libet see\nBonicalzi and Hggard, 2019.). The force of the work led by Haynes is\nmitigated by the fact that predictions of behavior from several\nseconds before its occurrence, while statistically significant, are\nfar from perfect. Many other points have been made (see Nahamias\n2008; Mele 2014; Shepherd 2017; Baumeister et al. 2018).\nTwo basic criticisms are offered by many writers. First, many of the\nexperimental conditions involve meaningless setups (ouija-like boards,\nfor example) or meaningless decisions (e.g., when to move a finger or\nwhich of two buttons to press) that bear little resemblance to\nreal-life decisions (e.g., whether to accept a job, or go to a\nparticular place for a vacation) where people bring substantive\nreasons and personal preferences to bear. These oddities and\nsimplifications may be thought to render ineffective psychological\nmechanisms that would be operative in more realistic cases and that\nwould forestall illusions about the relation between our consciously\nentertained reasons and our behavior. Second, the fact that there are\nsome cases in which unconscious influences have a noticeable effect on\nour behavior does not show that we are never, or even not usually,\nacting in a manner that would be rational, given our particular\nlongstanding beliefs and preferences.\n",
