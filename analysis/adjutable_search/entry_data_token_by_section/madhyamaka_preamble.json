    "main_text": "\n\nThe Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, the followers of which are called\nM\u0101dhyamikas, was one of the two principal schools of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in India, the other school being the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. The name of the school is a reference to the claim\nmade of Buddhism in general that it is a middle path\n(madhyam\u0101 pratipad) that avoids the two extremes of\neternalism\u2014the doctrine that all things exist because of an\neternal essence\u2014and annihilationism\u2014the doctrine that\nthings have essences while they exist but that these essences are\nannihilated just when the things themselves go out of existence. The\nconviction of the Madhyamaka school, which can be called the Centrist\nschool in English, is that this middle path is best achieved by a\ndenial that things have any inherent natures at all. All things are,\nin other words, empty of inherent natures. This doctrine of universal\nemptiness of inherent natures\n(svabh\u0101va-\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) is the hallmark of the\nschool, which places the school solidly in the tradition associated\nwith the Perfection of Wisdom\n(praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101) literature of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism.\n\nThe key texts of the school comprised commentaries to the writings of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2014the works of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna most often\ncommented upon are the M\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101\n(MMK) and Vigraha-vy\u0101vartan\u012b (VV)\u2014and a\nnumber of independent works that expanded on ideas found in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s writings. A few of the Sanskrit treatises\nof the early Madhyamaka school were translated into Chinese and became\nthe basis of a short-lived school of Chinese Buddhism. A significant\nnumber of Sanskrit Madhyamaka texts were eventually translated into\nTibetan and exerted considerable influence on the intellectual\nheritage of Tibetan Buddhism. This article will deal only with the\nMadhyamaka school in India from the fifth through the eighth\ncenturies, during which time the school underwent most of its\nevolution.\n",
