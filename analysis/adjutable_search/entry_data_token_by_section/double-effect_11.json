    "main_text": "End of Life Decision-Making || Terminal Sedation\n5.2 Terminal Sedation\n\nIn a U.S. Supreme Court decision that rejected arguments for\npermitting patients with terminal illness to request assistance from a\nphysician in ending their lives (Vacco et al. v. Quill et al., 117\nS.Ct. 2293 (1997), Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the\nmajority, invoked double effect not only as a justification for the\nadministration of pain-relieving drugs that might hasten death but\nalso as a justification for the practice known as terminal sedation or\ncontinuous sedation. This occurs when patients with terminal\nconditions who experience intractable pain that cannot be treated\neffectively with opioid or other analgesic drugs are treated with\nsedative drugs (which do not typically have analgesic properties) in\norder to induce unconsciousness. Artificial hydration and nutrition\nare not provided for patients sedated for these reasons in the context\nof palliative care at the end of life. If death is not already\nimminent for such a deeply sedated patient, dehydration and starvation\nwill make it inevitable. In such cases, withholding life-sustaining\ntreatment does in fact hasten death, intentionally but justifiably.\nProlonging the process of dying for a continuously sedated patient, in\nwhom sedation was initiated to deal with intractable pain, does not\nbenefit the patient.\n\nIn some cases, the patient\u2019s right to refuse life-sustaining\ntreatment, as expressed directly by the patient or through a proxy or\nan advance directive, is the justification for withholding artificial\nhydration and nutrition during terminal sedation. If a dying patient\nviews hastening death as a good to be pursued, then double\neffect\u2019s presumption that death is a harm that a physician may\nnot intend to bring about is at odds with the preferences of a patient\nwho rejects artificial hydration and nutrition in order to hasten\ndeath.\n\nTimothy E. Quill, M.D., Rebecca Dresser, J.D, and Dan W. Brock, Ph.D.\nargue that double effect, if applied consistently, would rule out the\npractice of terminal sedation. \u201cUnlike the use of high-dose\nopioids to relieve pain, with death as a possible but undesired side\neffect, terminal sedation inevitably causes death, which in many cases\nis what the patient desires. Although the overall goal of terminal\nsedation is to relieve otherwise uncontrollable suffering,\nlife-prolonging therapies are withdrawn with the intent of hastening\ndeath. Terminal sedation would thus not be permitted under the rule of\ndouble effect, even though it is usually considered acceptable\naccording to current legal and medical ethical standards\u201d\n(Quill, Dresser and Brock, 1997; see also Quill, Lo and Brock\n1997).\n\nThe belief that doctors can cite double effect reasoning to justify\nactions that hasten death tends to obscure rather than clarify these\nimportant issues in palliative care. A single principle is no\nsubstitute for the professional expertise of palliative care\nspecialists who seek to ensure a patient\u2019s comfort at the end of\nlife by using a variety of forms of care while respecting the\npatient\u2019s right to refuse even life-sustaining treatment.\nStandardized forms that invite patients with advanced chronic\nillnesses to specify in advance their Medical (or Physician)\nOrders regarding Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST or POLST form)\nallow patients to request or to reject various treatments that would\nextend their lives while also opting for forms of medical care that\nwill promote their comfort in dying (Bomba 2011). A physician\nproviding palliative care with the goal of promoting the\npatient\u2019s comfort might provide pain relief, supplemental oxygen\nor artificial hydration to a patient with the goal of increasing their\ncomfort, even when these treatments also have the effect of extending\nlife and prolonging the process of dying. The issues are complex and\ncannot be resolved with a single principle that endorses a single\nremedy. The compassionate ethos that the traditional application of\ndouble effect is often understood to express is a central commitment\nof palliative care, but the considerations to be taken into account go\nbeyond what could be explained by the principle of double effect.\n",
