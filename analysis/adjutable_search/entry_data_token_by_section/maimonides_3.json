    "main_text": "God and the Via Negativa\n4. God and the Via Negativa\n\n\nMaimonides offers several proofs for the existence of God, all of\nwhich are versions of the cosmological argument (GP 2.1).\nRather than begin with a definition of God and try to show that God\u2019s\nessence implies existence, he begins with a description of the world as\nwe know it and tries to show that it implies the existence of God.\nAccording to one such argument, we assume that the heavenly bodies are\nengaged in eternal motion. We then recognize that it is impossible for\nthere to be an infinite body or an infinite number of finite bodies. So\nevery corporeal thing is finite. If it is finite, it can only contain a\nfinite amount of power. If it can only contain a finite amount of\npower, it can only explain motion over a finite period of time. Because\nthe heavenly bodies are always moving, the only thing that can explain\nthat motion is an infinite power. Because an infinite power cannot be\ncontained in a finite thing, it cannot be corporeal. If it is not\ncorporeal, it is not subject to division or change. Seeing that its\npower is infinite, it cannot derive that power from something else.\nThus the only way to explain the motion of the heavenly bodies is to\nposit the existence of a being that is neither a body nor a force in a\nbody.\n\n\nAlthough Maimonides thinks this argument gives us sufficient grounds\nfor saying that God is, he does not think it provides any\ngrounds for saying what God is. To see why not, we have to\nrecognize that God is not one in a way comparable to anything else: one\nperson, one number, one idea. According to Guide 1.51:\n There is no oneness at all except in believing that\nthere is one simple essence in which there is no complexity or\nmultiplicity of notions, but one notion only; so that from whatever\nangle you regard it and from whatever point of view you consider it,\nyou will find that it is one, not divided in any way and by any cause\ninto two notions \u2026 \n\n\nIf Maimonides is right, there can be no plurality of faculties,\nmoral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that\nGod is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce\nplurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate\nattributes. The same is true if we say that God is a composite of\nmatter and form, genus and specific difference, or essence and\naccident. All introduce plurality where none can be tolerated.\n\n\nAside from religious considerations, plurality is objectionable\nbecause it compromises logical priority. If God were a composite of\nF and G, some reason would have to be found for what\nbrought them together and keeps them together. In short, if God were a\ncomposite, there would have to be a cause prior to God, which is absurd\n(GP 2. Intro., premise 21). For the same reason, God cannot be\nsubsumed under a wider concept as man is subsumed under\nanimal (GP 1.52). Once God fell under a genus, there\nwould be something prior to or more inclusive than God, either of which\nis absurd. Without a genus or a minimal form of composition, there is\nno possibility of defining God and thus no possibility of saying what\nGod is. Even superlatives are of no help. To say that God is the wisest\nor most powerful thing in the universe is still to subsume God under a\nwider description.\n\n\nWorse, to say that God is the wisest or most powerful thing is to\nimply that God\u2019s wisdom or power bears some likeness to ours. This\nMaimonides firmly denies (GP 1.56\u201357). The power manifested by\na body is finite and can be measured in foot/pounds. No matter how\npowerful it is, we can easily imagine something whose power is greater.\nWhat is more, if we are talking about the power of a body, it always\nmakes sense to ask from what it derives its power or how its power is\nrelated to something else, e.g. its goodness. None of this is true of\nGod. Maimonides therefore concludes (GP 1.56) that it is\nnot true to say that God\u2019s power is greater than ours, that\nGod\u2019s life is more permanent than ours, than God\u2019s knowledge is broader\nthan ours, or that God\u2019s will is more universal than ours, if that\nmeans that God can be put on the same scale as something else, that God\nis a bigger, stronger, better version of something in the created\norder.\n\n\nDoes that mean that statements like \u201cGod lives\u201d or\n\u201cGod is powerful\u201d are nonsense? The answer is yes if one\ninsists on interpreting them as normal subject/predicate propositions.\nBut they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations.\nThus \u201cGod is powerful\u201d should be taken as \u201cGod is not\nlacking in power.\u201d Maimonides\u2019 appeal to negation (GP\n1.58) is often misunderstood because in normal speech a double negative\nusually indicates a positive. If I say that this dog is not lacking in\nthe power of sight, you would be justified in concluding that it can\nsee for the simple reason that sight is a power normally associated\nwith dogs. What Maimonides has in mind is a more extreme form of\nnegation. Thus \u201cGod is powerful\u201d means \u201cGod does not\nlack power or possess it in a way that makes it comparable to\nother things.\u201d Can God do something like move a book off a shelf?\nYes, to the extent that God does not lack power but no to the extent\nthat God does not have to move muscles, summon energy, or receive a\nsupply of food or fuel. The power to create the whole universe is so\nfar beyond that needed to move a book that any comparison cannot help\nbut mislead.\n\n\nFrom an epistemological standpoint, a statement like \u201cGod is\npowerful\u201d is objectionable in so far as it implies that we have\ninsight into the essence of God. The advantage of the negative\nformulation is that it implies nothing of the sort. To say that God\ndoes not lack power or possess it in a way comparable to other things\nis to say that God\u2019s power is beyond our comprehension. And similarly\nfor God\u2019s life, wisdom, unity, or will. Thus most of the terms we use\nto describe God are completely equivocal as between God and us. There\nis then no reason to think that every time we praise God, we are\nidentifying a separate part of the divine persona and comparing it to\nsomething else.\n\n\nAs severe as Maimonides\u2019 position is, even this is not enough.\nAlthough negation is preferable to affirmation, even negation is\nobjectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity: God is\nneither this nor that. What then? Maimonides\u2019 reply (GP 1.58)\nis that ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us. Rather than\nprovide a precise metaphysical account of the nature of God, the\npurpose of theological discourse is heuristic: to \u201cconduct the\nmind toward the utmost reach that man may attain in the apprehension of\nHim.\u201d Theological language is important to the degree that it\neliminates error and sets us along the path of recognizing God\u2019s\ntranscendence. Unless one could speak about God, she could easily fall\ninto the trap of thinking that God is corporeal. But in the end, the\nonly thing it reveals is that God is beyond the reach of any\nsubject/predicate proposition. Thus GP 1.59:\n Know that when you make an affirmation ascribing\nanother thing to Him, you become more remote from Him in two respects:\none of them is that everything You affirm is a perfection only with\nreference to us, And the other is that He does not possess a thing\nother than His essence \u2026 \n\n\nCiting Psalm 65, Maimonides concludes that the highest form of\npraise we can give God is silence.\n\n\nMaimonides knows (GP 3.32) that a religion based entirely\non silent reflection would never succeed, and insists that daily prayer\nis mandatory (MT 2, Prayer, 1.1). His point is that the\nqualities mentioned in prayer are either negations or descriptions of\nthe effects of divine activity; in no case do they provide knowledge of\nGod\u2019s essence. To illustrate this point, he asks us to consider\nthe effect of fire on various things that could be put before it. It\nwould soften wax, harden clay, blacken sugar, and whiten other things.\nThis does not mean that fire is soft, hard, black, and white\nsimultaneously but that it has these effects on various things.\n\n\nApplying this analogy to God, we can say that God is merciful to the\nextent that the order of nature (what God created) exhibits merciful\ncharacteristics and angry to the extent that it is harsh toward things\nthat do not take proper care of themselves. The point is not that God\npossesses emotions similar to ours but that the effects of God\u2019s\nactions resemble the effects of ours. Maimonides refers to these\nqualities as attributes of action and identifies them with the\ngoodness God revealed to Moses at Exodus 33. In that passage, God\nrefuses to let Moses see the divine face (which Maimonides identifies\nwith essence) but allows him to see God\u2019s backside (which Maimonides\nidentifies with the consequences or effects that flow from God). We can\ntherefore praise God as long as we realize that all such praise is\nindirect and leaves God\u2019s essence undescribed and unknowable.\n",
