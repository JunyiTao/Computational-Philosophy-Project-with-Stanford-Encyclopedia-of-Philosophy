Prichard\u2019s Life\n\nBorn in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard\n(a solicitor) and his wife Lucy, Harold Prichard attended Clifton\nCollege in Bristol and was admitted to New College, Oxford to study\nmathematics. But after taking First Class honours in mathematical\nmoderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied Greats\n(ancient history and philosophy) taking First Class Honours in 1894.\nHe also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford\nhe spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London,\nbefore returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first\nas Fellow of Hertford College (1895\u20138) and then of Trinity\nCollege (1898\u20131924). He took early retirement from Trinity in\n1924 on grounds of temporary ill-health, but recovered and was elected\nto the White\u2019s Professorship of Moral Philosophy in 1928. He\nretired in 1937 and died in 1947.\n\nPrichard is mainly known for his work in moral philosophy, but the\nfirst of his very few publications were in epistemology. His main\nintellectual debt was to his teacher John Cook Wilson, whose thinking\ncentered on topics in epistemology and what would now be called\nphilosophical logic, rather than in ethics. In 1909 Prichard published\nhis only book, Kant\u2019s Theory of Knowledge, which was an\naccount of Kant\u2019s Transcendental Idealism. This book criticized\nKant severely, and Prichard acknowledges that his main arguments\nagainst Kant originated from Cook Wilson. The book\u2019s main\nconclusion is that \u2018Knowledge is sui generis and\ntherefore a \u2018theory\u2019 of knowledge is impossible. Knowledge\nis knowledge, and any attempt to state it in terms of something else\nmust end in describing something which is not knowledge\u2019 (p.\n245). This view that a \u2018theory\u2019 of knowledge is impossible\nhas its analogue in Prichard\u2019s later argument that there can be\nno philosophical account of moral obligation of the sort that moral\nphilosophers have traditionally tried to provide.\n\nCook Wilson\u2019s influence is also evident in Prichard\u2019s\nargument against Kant\u2019s view that we cannot know things in\nthemselves, but only know them as they present themselves, or appear,\nto us. Prichard inherits from Cook Wilson the view that any state of\nmind that affects the nature of its presentations cannot be knowledge.\nKnowledge can only be of what it does not affect; its object must be\nentirely independent. In Kant\u2019s terms, then, the only possible\nobjects of knowledge are things in themselves. Appearances, assuming\nthat they are objects, cannot be known at all, but must be the object\nof some other state of mind.\n\nBut appearances are not objects. When two lines appear to converge,\nthere is, we might say, an appearance of convergence here, but we\nshould not understand this as the two lines presenting a appearance\nthat is convergent. Appearances can be neither convergent, nor\ndivergent; and they cannot be parallel either. More generally, spatial\nproperties cannot be properties of appearances, since no appearance\ncan be great or small, square or round, bent or straight. Prichard\ntherefore thinks of the noun \u2018appearance\u2019 is a source of\nconfusion, because it leads us to think of appearances as objects with\ntheir own \u2018phenomenal\u2019 properties, and thereby to ascribe\nto them properties that really belong (or perhaps only appear to\nbelong) to the object that so appears. Having fallen victim to this\nmistake, we then make the further mistake of supposing that we can\nnever cognize objects as they are, but only as they appear to be, and\nwe understand this last as cognition of the appearances rather than of\nthe objects. But an object can of course be the way it appears to be,\nand when it is, its so appearing makes it possible for us to know that\nit is so. So in knowing how things appear we sometimes know how they\nare \u2013 indeed, how they are \u2018in themselves\u2019.\n\nThe view that knowledge must be of what is independent is the second\nprong of Prichard\u2019s persistent attacks on the notion of a\nsense-datum (and thereby on Russell, Moore and Price). A sense-datum,\nhe says, is supposed to be something of whose existence we know in\nevery case of perception. But sense-data are not supposed to have an\nindependent existence, and therefore the very conception of a\nsense-datum involves a contradiction. As Prichard came to see it, the\nbasic mistake made by defenders of a sense-datum theory is that of\nsupposing that perceiving is a form of knowing; all the other errors\nflow from this (Prichard 1938; see also his 1909, p. 99).\n\nPrichard continued to work and to lecture on topics in epistemology,\nin particular perception. He gave lectures on Modern Philosophy\n(Descartes, Locke, Berkeley and Hume) every year for the first five\nyears of his tenure of the White\u2019s Professorship. Indeed he\nlectured as often on these topics as on moral philosophy. He wrote on\nthe perception of movement and the apprehension of time. He said,\ncharacteristically, that \u2018the hearing a sound \u2013 a sound\nhaving as such a duration \u2013 and in general what is called the\nperceiving anything which has a duration \u2013 is absolutely\nunderivative and cannot be resolved into anything else\u2019\n(Knowledge and Perception ed. Ross, 48). I cannot resist\nquoting also a passage from a lecture on perception which was not\npublished in Prichard\u2019s lifetime, with the warning that Prichard\nwas known to trail his coat in lectures, in the hope of generating\nlively discussion (ibid., 59\u201360). \u2018For as soon as\nwe compare our states or processes of seeing with one another or with\nother states or processes of perceiving we have to allow that we do\nnot see bodies. For example, it is certain that if\nwe see bodies we in some cases see a body move, but it is also\ncertain that we cannot possibly ever see a body move; for in\nspite of what the followers of Einstein say, motion is, and is always\nreally thought of as, absolute, relative motion being a contradiction\nin terms. (I should like, incidentally, but without any sense of\nshame, to offer this statement as a specimen of one of the few\nstatements of things which we can really be said to know.)\nAnd, motion being absolute, when we are said to be seeing a body move,\nwe cannot possibly be really doing so, since a stationary body would\npresent precisely the same appearance to us, provided our body was\nmoving in a certain way, so that in that case we should be seeing a\nbody move although in fact it was stationary.\u2019\n\nPrichard was renowned in Oxford (and not only among philosophers) for\nthe simplicity and clarity of his writing style, though he published\nso little of what he wrote. There are also occasional moments of wry\nhumour such as his comment in a commemorative piece on Joseph:\n\u2018His best memorial, unlike that of many other teachers, perhaps\nconsists in the books that his pupils refrained from writing.\u2019\nPrichard is standing here in a venerable Oxford tradition of not\npublishing oneself and discouraging others either by example and\nprecept (Cook Wilson, Prichard \u2013 but not in fact Joseph) or by\nfear (Austin). Prichard\u2019s daughter wrote: \u2018My father was\nalways so reluctant to publish\u2019 (quoted in MacAdam 2002,\nxv).\n\nFinally, some anecdotes and personal testimony:\n\nAustin was much impressed by Prichard, whom he thought the most\nrigorous and minute thinker in Oxford (Berlin, 1973, 2). J. O. Urmson\ntold me that Austin had attended Prichard\u2019s lectures as an\nundergraduate in the early 1930s, sat right at the front and asked\nvery many questions. Eventually Prichard wrote to Austin\u2019s tutor\nin Balliol (I\u2019m not sure who that was), asking him to persuade\nAustin either not to ask so many questions, or not to attend at all.\nBut Austin did neither of these things. Urmson himself wrote \u2018As\na member of the very last generation of undergraduates to attend\nPrichard\u2019s lectures and informal instruction, I learnt to admire\nhis patience as a teacher, his philosophical acuity and, above all,\nhis quite exceptional intellectual honesty and independence.\u2019\n(This is in his introduction to his Prichard collection, reprinted in\nMacAdam, p. x.)\n\nC. D. Broad called Prichard \u2018a man of immense ability whom I\nhave always regarded as the Oxford Moore\u2019 (Cheney 1971, 14). It\nis also worth reporting Broad\u2019s remarks about Prichard\u2019s\nexamination of T. H. Green: \u2018Seldom can the floor have been more\nthoroughly wiped with the remains of one who was at one time commonly\nregarded as a great thinker and who still enjoys a considerable\nreputation in some circles\u2019 (1950, 557). The realist backlash\nagainst nineteenth century Oxford Idealism was complete.\n\nWittgenstein came to speak in Oxford in 1947, just before\nPrichard\u2019s death. He had said he did not want to read a paper,\nbut was willing to respond to a paper given by some agreeable student.\nO. P. Wood, who was still an undergraduate (at Corpus Christi) was set\nup as the fall guy, and read a paper on the Cogito.\nWittgenstein, using the paper as a springboard for his own ideas,\nresponded at length. Prichard made several interventions, on each\noccasion very deliberately mispronouncing Wittgenstein\u2019s name as\nWhittgensteen. Finally he rose again and said, in his high reedy voice\n\u2018Mr. Whittgensteen, Mr. Whittgensteen, you have not answered the\nquestion. Cogito ergo sum \u2013 I think therefore I am. Is\nit true, Mr Whittgensteen, is it true \u2013 I think therefore I\nam?\u2019. Wittgenstein, exasperated, turned very icy and replied\n\u2018I think this is a very foolish old man; so I am \u2013\nwhat?\u2019. (This story comes from Peter Hacker, who heard it from\ntwo people who were there, J. O. Urmson and H. L. A. Hart. Hart\nthought that Wittgenstein\u2019s reply was brilliant repartee; Urmson\nthought it unforgivably rude.)\n2. Prichard\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n\n[All simple page references from now on will be to the MacAdam 2002\nedition of Prichard\u2019s work.]\n\nPrichard starts where many moral philosophers never tread: from an\naccount of what an act is. For him, an act is the origination of a\nstate of affairs. That is, to act is to originate a state of affairs.\nThe agent is the originator.\n\nWhat makes an act, so conceived, either right or wrong? Prichard holds\nthat the rightness of an act is \u2018constituted\u2019 by a\ncombination of two things:\n\nthe nature of the state of affairs originated, and\nwhat Prichard calls \u2018a definite relation\u2019 in which the\nagent stands to himself or to others, that relation forming part of\nthe actual situation in which he has to act.\n\n\nWhat this means is that a right act is made right by such a\ncombination of features. An example might be that of an act made right\nby being the origination of a certain change, say, the educating of a\nyoung person, and the relation between the agent and that person, say,\nhis being her parent. However Prichard is pretty catholic about what\nis to count as a relation, since he allows common humanity to count as\nsuch: \u2018the obligation not to hurt the feelings of another\ninvolves no special relation of us to that other, i.e. no relation\nother than that of our both being men, and men in one and the same\nworld\u2019 (13). So a \u2018definite\u2019 relation need not be a\n\u2018special\u2019 relation.\n\nThere is a question what Prichard meant to exclude by his claim about\nwhat constitutes the rightness of an act. One thing he definitely\nmeant to exclude was that an act can be made right merely by the\ngoodness of its consequences. He argues (216\u201317) that this alone\ncannot be sufficient to constitute an act as right. Take an act whose\nconsequence will be an increase in someone\u2019s patience, which is\ngood. If that someone is oneself, one has a duty to do it, Prichard\nclaims; if it is someone else, one also has a duty to act in that way\nbut it is a different duty. So the mere goodness of the consequence is\ninsufficient to render an act a duty. We need also to know what the\nrelevant \u2018definite relation\u2019 is.\n\nAs it stands, however, all this is compatible with the view that the\nrightness of an act is (at least capable of being) constituted by this\ncombination:\n\n\n\n1.*\nthe value of the state of affairs originated, and \n\n2.\na definite relation.  \n\n\nBut in my view this reading of Prichard is wrong; it would involve two\nmistakes. The first, less subtle but still enticing, is to suppose\nthat the value of the state of affairs originated is at least part of\nwhat we would now call the \u2018ground\u2019 of the relevant duty\n\u2013 part of what makes the action a duty. The second, more subtle,\nis to suppose that the phrase \u2018state of affairs\noriginated\u2019 refers to the consequences of the action rather than\nto the nature of the action itself. I will comment on the first of\nthese supposed mistakes immediately, and on the second later.\n\nOne might be forgiven for thinking that Prichard is a sort of\nagent-relative consequentialist. He says that \u2018unless the effect\nof an act were in some way good, there would be no obligation to\nproduce it, i.e. the goodness of the thing produced is a\npresupposition of the obligation to produce it\u2019 (2). And he says\nthat a moral principle specifies two things, (a) a good thing which\nthe action will produce and (b) a definite relation\u2026\u2019\n(4). And in his most famous published article he writes \u2018At best\nit can only be maintained that there is this element of truth in the\nUtilitarian view, that unless we recognized that something which an\nact will originate is good, we should not recognize that we ought to\ndo the action\u2019 (10). I take it, however, that it is one thing to\nspecify as part of the ground something that is good, and another to\nsay that its goodness is itself part of the ground, and that\nPrichard\u2019s choice of the word \u2018presupposition\u2019 was\nwell advised. (Not all necessary conditions for the rightness of an\nact are parts of the ground for that rightness; consider the role of\nthe fact that there is nothing else that one should be doing instead.)\nAnd I would offer in support of this reading the following sentence\nfrom the same paper: \u2018we do not come to appreciate an obligation\nby an argument, i.e. by a process of non-moral thinking, and in\nparticular we do not do so by an argument of which a premiss is the\nethical but not moral activity of appreciating the goodness either of\nthe act or of a consequence of the act, i.e. our sense of the\nrightness of an act is not a conclusion from our appreciation of the\ngoodness either of it or of anything else\u2019 (13\u201314). Note\nthe words \u2018a premiss\u2019 in this sentence.\n\nWhy did Prichard reject all such appeals to value? I think his main\npoint is similar in style to the main \u2018argument\u2019 of\nBerkeley\u2019s Principles \u00a73. \u2018Suppose we ask ourselves\nwhether our sense that we ought to pay our debts or to tell the truth\narises from our recognition that in doing so we would be originating\nsomething good \u2026 We at once and without hesitation answer\n\u201cNo\u201d\u2019 (10). But he does try to support this claim by\nargument. For instance, it might be held that the reasoning that runs\n\u2018This would be the repayment of a debt, and one which I\nvoluntarily incurred; so I ought to do it\u2019 is actually\nenthymematic, and properly runs \u2018This would be the repayment of\na debt, and one which I voluntarily incurred; such a result would be\ngood; so I ought to do it\u2019. But Prichard says that there is\nnothing much wrong with the original reasoning, and that the expanded\nversion is actually worse, since it appeals to an unsound principle,\nthat what is good ought to be. The principle is unsound because the\nidea of \u2018ought to be\u2019 does not make sense; what makes\nsense is \u2018I ought to do it\u2019. But we can only derive\n\u2018I ought to do it\u2019 by means of a principle that what is\ngood ought to be, and another that if something ought to be, then we\nought to do whatever would have it as a consequence. But these\nprinciples require us to think of the good as somehow imperatival\n(nowadays we would say \u2018deontic\u2019), because otherwise there\nwould be no explanation of our ability to extract an\n\u2018ought\u2019 from a \u2018good\u2019 \u2013 and nobody\nthinks of the good as imperatival in that way. Further, it does not\nfollow that if some state of affairs would be good, and I am able to\nbring it about by acting in some way, then I ought to act in that way.\nSuppose, for instance, that it would be good if you gave money to a\nhospital, and that you would do this if I wrote you a letter asking\nyou to make some contribution. Does it follow that I ought to write\nyou a letter? Not at all. What follows is not even that my writing you\na letter would be good. (Prichard rejects the very notion of the\n\u2018instrumentally good\u2019.) All that we get is that my writing\nyou a letter is something that would have a good result, which is just\nwhat we had at the beginning.\n\nSo much for Prichard\u2019s views about what makes acts right. He\nfurther held that every act that is right is of a type (specified as\nabove) such that all acts of that type are right. At least, this is\nhow he expressed himself early in his career. Later, he came to\nrealize that this was incautious. We may have one act that is right,\nand which is of such and such a type, and which (as he would have\nsaid) is made right by being of that type, but where there could be\nanother act of that type which is not right, because it is also of\nanother type which is more important, as it were, and which makes the\nact either not a duty, or even plain wrong. So what he came to say was\nthat if an act is right, it is of a type such that all acts of that\ntype make a claim on the agent \u2013 a claim which may however be\ndefeated by a greater claim made on the agent to avoid acting in that\nway. Either way round, Prichard is not a particularist. Wherever an\nact is right, according to him, there is a principle at work.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that in order to appreciate the rightness\nof the act, one must appeal to the principle. Prichard\u2019s view is\nquite the contrary. The main thrust of his famous article is the claim\nthat \u2018the sense of obligation to do, or of the rightness of, an\naction of a particular kind is absolutely underivative and\nimmediate\u2019 (12). To come to recognize that an act is a duty, one\nneed only concentrate on the relevant non-moral facts, facts about the\nstate of affairs that one will, if successful, originate (including\nany consequences) and facts about the relations in which one stands\nhere to others and to oneself (e.g. that one borrowed the money and\npromised to return it by the end of the week). Then, by an act of\nspecifically moral thinking, one recognizes that those facts together\nmake a claim on one to respond in a specific way, and that the claim\nmade is stronger than any competing claim thrown up by other features\nof the situation. Again, \u2018Suppose we come genuinely to doubt\nwhether we ought, for example, to pay our debts \u2026 The only\nremedy lies in actually getting into a situation which occasions the\nobligation, or \u2013 if our imagination be strong enough \u2013 in\nimagining ourselves in that situation, and then letting our capacities\nof moral thinking do their work\u2019 (20).\n\nBut Prichard also supposes that if we ask why a feature that grounds\nan obligation does so, for example why the fact that I borrowed the\nmoney means that I ought to pay it back, all we can really do is to\noffer a principle, e.g. \u2018because I ought to pay anything I\nowe\u2019 (4). If we then go on to ask for a reason for the\nprinciple, there is nothing left to be said. But this is not because\nthere is no reason for the principle; it is because the principle\n\u2018includes its reason, the reason becoming explicit when the\nprinciple is properly expressed\u2019 (ibid.). It is when we\nhave lost our sense of the truth of the principle itself, so\nconceived, that \u2018the only remedy lies\u2019 in exposing\nourselves to a real or imaginary case. \u2018We first recognize the\nparticular obligation and then by reflecting on it discover the\nprinciple, i.e. formulate to ourselves that general character of the\nact which renders it, or any act like it, an obligation\u2019\n(5).\n\nThis process, then, enables one to discern a moral principle, one that\nsays that all acts of a specified type (that is, which are the\norigination of some specified sort of state of affairs), and whose\nagents stand in some specified relation either to others or to\nthemselves, are such that there is a claim on those agents to act in\nthat way, this claim being grounded in the specified nature of the act\nand/or the relevant relation. Knowing this principle might be of some\nuse. But if one comes to doubt the principle, just gazing at it will\nnot restore one\u2019s confidence in it, no matter how searching\none\u2019s gaze. Nor will it help to try to infer the principle from\nsomething else; \u201cthe remedy lies not in any process of general\nthinking\u201d (20). To recover one\u2019s sense of its truth, one\nneeds to put oneself into a situation of the relevant sort, or at\nleast to imagine oneself in such a situation, if one\u2019s\nimagination is powerful enough, and see whether the sense of\nobligation arises or not.\n3. The Good, the Right, and the Obligatory\n\nIt is characteristic of intuitionists to deny that the right can be\nderived from the good, and Prichard, as we have seen, was no\nexception. Some intuitionists think that the good can be derived from\nthe right, perhaps by thinking of the good as that which it is right\nto approve, admire, seek. Prichard does not take this sort of line\neither. For him, goodness is very different from rightness. Goodness\nseems to be a simple monadic property. The things that can have this\nproperty are states of affairs, people and actions. An act can be\nthought of as good, but whenever we do so, we are really thinking of\nits motive; a good act is one done from a good motive. Prichard\ndistinguished between the moral motive, which is a sense of\nobligation, and ordinary motives, which are desires. \u2018Desire and\na sense of obligation are co-ordinate species of motive\u2019 (15).\nThere is the act, the origination of a change, and there is the motive\nfor that act. Acts themselves are not good or bad. But we can think of\nthe act together with its motive, and think of such a thing as good or\nbad. Prichard used the term \u2018action\u2019 for this combination\nof act and motive (officially, but not always consistently). Acts\ncannot really be good or bad, but actions can (156\u20137).\n\nWe might protest that an act can surely be good if it has good\nconsequences: it is \u2018instrumentally good\u2019, that is, good\nas a means (though not good as an instrument; the term\n\u2018instrumental value\u2019 is a snare). Prichard\u2019s\nresponse to this is that being a means to a good is not a way of being\ngood.\n\nObligatoriness is completely different. It looks initially as if\nobligatoriness \u2013 being what one ought to do \u2013 is another\nmonadic property, distinct from goodness. If it is, the only things\nthat can have this property are acts. The motive with which an act is\ndone is irrelevant to its obligatoriness; one can do what one ought\nfor the wrong reason, or from a bad motive (11\u201312). Agents\ncannot have obligatoriness, and nor can outcomes. And to think of an\naction (in Prichard\u2019s official sense) as obligatory is just\nevidence of confusion. If an action is what one ought to do, it is\nbecause the act involved, the origination, is what one ought to do.\nMotives themselves cannot be morally right or wrong. Nor can one have\nan obligation to act from a certain motive, for two reasons. First,\none is not able to choose to have a motive, and one can only have an\nobligation to do something that one is capable of choosing to do or\nnot to do. In general, we either have certain motives or we\ndon\u2019t, and there is not a lot that we can do about it. (We can,\nof course, try to train ourselves up so that we are in a better\nposition next time.) Second, when we choose an action, the motive for\nwhich we will act if we do so act is already given (12). There is not,\nand cannot be, a separate motive for which we will choose the action.\nThe motive for choice is the motive for acting.\n\nBut in fact Prichard held, or at least came to hold, that\nobligatoriness is not a property of acts at all. An act that ought to\nbe done is one that is obligatory for some agent, one that that agent\nought to do, or that is his duty. These notions of duty, obligation,\nand ought really denote properties of agents. It is not so much the\naction that is obligatory as the agent that has the obligation to do\nit, or to act in that way. There is no obligatoriness out there,\nbelonging to the act that we are considering. A sense of obligation is\nnot a recognition of a property that the act has got, in addition to\nall its more normal properties. It is really a sense that one is\nobliged, or ought, to act in that way. One might think of this as a\nrelation, except that there is no act there yet for one to be related\nto in the obligated way. It is not a relation, then. But if one is\nobliged to act in this way, that will (as I said at the beginning) be\nbecause of \u2013 be constituted by \u2013 facts about the act and\nabout relations in which one stands to others or to oneself.\n\nWe can now see further reason for rejecting these two inferences:\n\nIf this action would be good, I ought to do it.\n\n\nIf this act would have a good result, I ought to do it.\n\n\nBoth inferences take us from a remark about an act or action to a\nremark about an agent. Prichard asks us what the principles of these\ninferences could possibly be.\n\nOf course Prichard does not just announce that obligatoriness is not a\nproperty of acts. He has two arguments. The first is that there are\nepistemic difficulties in supposing that acts are made obligatory by\nobjective matters of fact such as their own nature and the attendant\ncircumstances. Most of these things are things that we cannot truly\nknow to be the case, such as what results our action will have (at\nthis point Prichard is appealing to the theory of knowledge that he\ninherited from Cook Wilson). If so, we would hardly ever be able to\nknow what our duty was; and the thought that most of our duties are\nthings of which we cannot know is unbearable. This difficulty vanishes\nif we suppose that the ground for duty is not the objective nature of\nthe situation, but the way the agent supposes things to be. But if we\nmake that move, we suppose that the ground for duty lies in some fact\nabout the agent (that she so supposes), and this makes it much easier\nto think of the duty itself as attaching to the agent rather than to\nthe act. (On this argument and its peculiarities, see Dancy,\n2002.)\n\nPrichard\u2019s second argument is equally idiosyncratic. We can have\nan obligation to do an action long before the action is done. If so,\nthe obligation cannot be a feature of the action, since it exists\nbefore the action does. It must be a feature of something else, if it\nis a feature of anything, and the obvious candidate is the agent.\n\nThis argument impressed Prichard. But Broad wrote \u2018I find it\ndifficult to persuade myself that this argument is very\nformidable\u2019 (1950, 555). I don\u2019t myself think that the\nargument is especially formidable, exactly, but it does serve to\nprevent errors of various sorts, such as the error of thinking that\ndeciding what to do is like choosing chocolates from a box, as if the\nactions between which one is choosing are somehow laid out before one\nin their full particularity, waiting to be chosen, that is, done. In\nthe present case, the question is how to avoid the argument without\ngoing down Prichard\u2019s route. It is true that there is no\nparticular action that we are now obliged to do tomorrow; what we are\nobliged to do is only to act in a certain way; there will be a wide\nvariety of actions that would meet that obligation, and we are not\nobliged to do one of them rather than any other. If we have to pay the\nmoney, it doesn\u2019t matter, so far as that goes, how we go about\ndoing it. But how does this help us understand what it is that is\nobligatory \u2013 the owner of the obligatoriness, as it were? It\ncannot belong to \u2018acting in a certain way\u2019. The most we\ncould do would be to abandon the idea of obligatoriness as a character\nbelonging to \u2018acting in a way\u2019 and think instead of\nsomething like \u2018it is obligatory that p\u2019, where p stands\nfor \u2018A Vs\u2019. But even that doesn\u2019t quite work, since\nit seems to specify a state of affairs or perhaps an event as\nobligatory, and this makes no sense at all. The only way to resolve\nthe impasse is to take Prichard\u2019s way out and award the\nobligation to the agent, yielding \u2018A is obliged to V\u2019\n\u2013 which is where Prichard wanted to take us.\n\nSo when one senses an obligation one senses a character of oneself, a\nclaim on oneself to act in a certain way. And to sense an obligation\nall that is needed is to put oneself into the relevant situation and\nconsider the various ways of acting that are available, and the\nvarious relevant relations in which one stands to others and to\noneself. If this does not lead to a sense of obligation, there is\nnothing much else that can do it. Moral philosophy, certainly, offers\nno such resources, and the Mistake on which Moral Philosophy rests, to\nrevert to the title of Prichard\u2019s famous article, is to suppose\notherwise.\n\nDespite all this, in the article in which Prichard addresses these\nissues (1932) he seems at one point to distinguish the obligatory from\nthe right, and to suppose that rightness is still to be understood as\na monadic property of the act, like goodness. If that is the correct\nreading, it introduces considerable complications. See Dancy (2002)\nfor comment.\n4. The Rights and Wrongs of Non-intuitionism\n\nPrichard works initially with Sidgwick\u2019s contrast between\nintuitionism as the view that conduct is right when conforming to\ncertain principles known to be unconditionally binding, and\nnon-intuitionism as the view that there are ends at which we should\naim. (The view that there are ends that we should do what we can to\nrealize, which is a different view, is according to Prichard not\nSidgwick\u2019s official view, but a better view that Sidgwick should\nhave adopted instead.)\n\nPrichard argues that when one asks oneself what it is to aim at an\noutcome, the answer has to be that it is to act from the desire of it,\nthat is, to be motivated by the prospect of achieving it. But in that\ncase, Sidgwick (as a non-intuitionist) is maintaining that right\nactions are those that have a certain motive. And Prichard has his\nargument (which we have already seen) that we cannot be required to\nact from a certain motive, since our motivation is not something over\nwhich we have the required control. This form of non-intuitionism,\nthen, is a non-starter, despite the fact that it appears to be\nSidgwick\u2019s preferred form.\n\nWhat is more, Prichard thinks that even if it were true that we ought\nto aim at this end, it would not follow that we ought to do what (we\nthink) will lead to it. The derived \u2018ought\u2019 here can only\nbe identical with the sort of \u2018ought\u2019 that we derive in\nnon-moral cases, as when we say to a poisoner \u2018you ought to give\na second dose\u2019, and such an \u2018ought\u2019 has no force for\nthose who have not adopted the relevant end. This is partly because it\nis not true that we have a moral duty to do those actions that will\nlead to outcomes that we have a duty to aim at. We might, for\ninstance, have a duty to help the sick, and it may be that the only\nway to achieve that end is to write begging letters to our more\nprosperous friends. But it does not follow that we have a duty to\nwrite those letters. It will be true that we ought to write those\nletters, but this only means (says Prichard) that if we do not write\nthem, we will not achieve our end. The \u2018ought\u2019 here is the\nnon-moral \u2018ought\u2019.\n\nWe might think (and Broad did think) that Prichard cannot be right to\nsay that there are only two sorts of \u2018ought\u2019: the moral\none, full-blown, and the means-end one which only has force for those\nwho have adopted the end, and only says that if they don\u2019t take\nthis means they will not achieve that end. I myself would want to\nappeal to the normative force of advice. But Prichard\u2019s main\npoint might survive such a response. For all that he needs to\nestablish is that in order to show that we have a moral duty to write\nthe begging letters we need to do more than show that it is the best\nor only means to something which we have a moral duty to aim at.\n\nPrichard thinks, however, that Sidgwick never really considered the\nquestion what it is to aim at an outcome, and that if he had he would\nhave abandoned his official view for a very different view, namely\nthat our duty is not to aim at certain outcomes, but to achieve them\nor ensure them.\n\nThis new view, however, comes in two forms, which emerge when we ask\nwhat it is about those outcomes that gives us a duty to ensure them.\nThe first answer, which again we can attribute to Sidgwick, is that it\nis the value of those outcomes that grounds the relevant duty. But we\nhave already seen Prichard\u2019s attack on this view. He claims that\nit doesn\u2019t survive the test of instances; nobody thinks that\ntheir sense of obligation, when they feel obliged to do something,\narises from their recognition that in so acting they will be\noriginating something good. And even if they did, it is impossible to\nunderstand how the supposed duty can be derived from some fact about\ngoodness. For duty is imperatival in nature and goodness is not. We\nwould have to find some link between the goodness of the action and\nthe duty to act, and all such links are spurious.\n\nThe only remaining alternative is to say that the ground for our duty\nto ensure certain outcomes lies not in their value but in their\nnature. But Prichard claims that this is just a form of intuitionism\nin its conception of our duties \u2013 at least in its conception of\nthose duties that are grounded in outcomes (137\u201342). We are\ndealing with principles that are unconditionally binding, and which\nrequire us to achieve certain ends, or ensure certain outcomes. There\nis nothing here that is inconsistent with intuitionism, or even hard\nfor the intuitionist to explain. At this stage non-intuitionism\ncollapses into intuitionism. For the act which it is our duty to do is\nthe origination of a change, and the act of originating that change is\nnot a duty in virtue of its consequences, or outcomes; it is a duty in\nits own nature.\n\n(For an excellent discussion of Prichard\u2019s argument in this\nconnection, see Shaver 2018.)\n5. The Rights and Wrongs of Kantianism\n\nPrichard\u2019s other main target was Kant. As he sees it, Kant\nmaintained that an action is right if and only if it is done from the\nmotive of duty, that is, from a sense of obligation. Now Prichard\nwants to admit that it can be good to act from this motive; maybe this\nis the only morally good motive. Other motives, such as a general\nbenevolence, may make the relevant action good, but cannot make it\nmorally good. But he wants first to insist that we cannot have an\nobligation to act from a particular motive, as we have already seen.\nAnd there are further difficulties peculiar to Kant\u2019s position,\nin which the motive is specified as the conviction that the act\nconcerned is a duty. The first is that the position has the\nconsequence that no act, in Prichard\u2019s official narrow sense, is\na duty at all. One\u2019s duty is to act from the motive of duty,\nnever to do this or that act in the narrow sense. So Prichard is able\nto present Kant as holding that there is nothing that we ought to do,\nand therefore that it is impossible to act from the sense that one\nought to do this. If so, Kant has undermined his own position, since\nhis understanding of the motive of duty shows that there can be no\nsuch thing. Or rather, if there is such a thing as the motive of duty,\nit follows necessarily that it cannot be one\u2019s sole or primary\nduty to act on it.\n\nThis is a lovely chain of criticism, but it seems to me to suffer from\na mistake right at the beginning \u2013 which, if it is a mistake, is\none echoed by Ross (1930, 5), though Ross corrected his mistake later\n(1939, 139). Kant held that an action was only morally good if done\nfrom the motive of duty, but he did not hold, as far as I can see,\nthat an act is only right if done from that motive. The Kantian\nCategorical Imperative \u2018I ought never to act except in such a\nway that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal\nlaw\u2019 need not, and surely should not, be read as saying acts are\nonly right if motivated in a certain way. Kant treats it as an open\nquestion whether an act done \u2018in conformity with duty\u2019 has\nalso been done \u2018from duty\u2019. He would think it possible for\npeople to do what they ought, do the right thing, even if their\nactions do not have the special sort of value that so interests him.\nActions have that sort of value when they are done out of respect for\nthe law rather than merely in accordance with it.\n\nSo it seems to me that Prichard imposes on Kant a view that he neither\nheld nor needed to hold (but see the extended discussion of Kant\n(153\u20139), which ends \u2018Plainly he had not fully thought the\nposition out.\u2019). Prichard would have done better to concentrate\non the difference between Kant\u2019s account of how it comes about\nthat an action is a duty and his own minimal account. Kant\u2019s\nexplanation would start from the fact that the maxim of the action can\nbe willed as a universal law. Prichard would, I think, say that there\nis no possibility of, or need for, any such explanation. This is just\none more instance of the quietism that characterizes intuitionism as\nopposed to constructivism.\n6. Significant Issues on Which Prichard Changed His Mind\n\nPrichard\u2019s views remained broadly unchanged throughout his life,\nexcept in the following respects.\n6.1 The moral motive\n\nPrichard originally thought that conscience, or a sense of obligation,\nwas a distinct species of motive from desire. \u2018A sense of\nobligation does sometimes move us to act\u2019 (15). In this he was a\nprecursor of the direction that intuitionistic moral philosophy would\ntake 60 years later. By 1928, however, he had abandoned this dualist\nview, writing \u2018Again, if we face the purely general question\n\u2018Can we really do anything whatever unless in some respect or\nother we desire to do it?\u2019 we have to answer\n\u201cNo\u201d\u2019 (38; see also 129). On this new understanding\na sense of obligation was not a motive at all, since it involved no\ndesire; to get motivation, one needs in addition a desire to do the\nright. This \u2018externalist\u2019 position, also adopted by Ross,\nopened the door to complaints that on the intuitionist picture moral\ncognition was the recognition of facts that lacked any intrinsic\nconnection to action; it should be possible to come to know that it is\nwrong to kill the innocent without thinking of that as at all relevant\nto one\u2019s choice of action. And those complaints eventually\nbecame the strongest argument for non-cognitivism in meta-ethics.\n6.2 The nature of action\n\nAt the beginning of his career Prichard writes \u2018In action we\nconsciously originate a change\u2019 (1). On p.10 he speaks\napparently without strain both of our action as being the origination\nof a change and as originating that change, and of ourselves as\noriginating that change. In the Manuscript on Morals (of uncertain\ndate, perhaps c. 1928), we read that the phrase \u2018an\naction\u2019 is ambiguous, but \u2018ordinarily it stands for the\norigination or bringing something about \u2026 such as the action of\npoking a fire or annoying a neighbour\u2019.\n\nBy 1932 he has moved on, but only a little. \u2018It is, no doubt,\nnot easy to say what we mean by \u2018an action\u2019 or by\n\u2018doing something\u2019. Yet we have in the end to allow that we\nmean by it originating, causing, or bringing about the existence of\nsomething, viz. some new state of an existing thing or substance, or,\nmore shortly, causing a change of state of some existing thing.\n\u2026 We may be tempted to go farther, and say that we mean by\n\u2018an action\u2019 the conscious origination of something, i.e.\nthe originating something knowing that we are doing so. But this will\nnot do; for no one, for instance, thinks himself to be denying that he\nhas hurt a person\u2019s feelings when he says that he did not know\nthat he was hurting them, and, indeed, thought he was not\u2019\n(85).\n\nBut at this point Prichard introduces a distinction between what we\ncause directly and what we cause indirectly. He says that when we\ncause something indirectly, by causing something else to cause it,\n\u2018the result is not wholly due to us\u2019. When we cause\nsomething directly, by contrast, it is wholly due to us. And Prichard\ngives us an example of such a thing, namely \u2018transferring\ncertain ink to certain places on a piece of paper\u2019. But he\nmaintains that if such a thing were an obligation, it would be the\nsort of obligation we would never be able to know that we have,\nbecause we can never know what will in fact result. If we are to be\ncapable of knowing our obligations, they cannot be obligations which\nwe cannot know that we have met when we have met them. If so, our\nobligations cannot be to achieve this or that outcome, but only to\n\u2018set ourselves to achieve them\u2019. All actions that are\nobligatory are of this sort. And Prichard evidently concludes that\nwhen we cause a change directly, in each case there is such a thing as\n\u2018setting oneself to cause that change\u2019, which may be\nsuccessful and may not be. An action that is a failure is still an\naction. So though we may describe an action in terms of its further\neffects, say lighting the fire, a necessary part of that action will\nhave been a \u2018setting oneself to \u2026\u2019.\n\nAt the end of his life, in 1945, he writes that the view he has\ninherited from Cook Wilson, namely that to act is to originate a\nchange, has to be wrong. In fact, to act is to will a change, and the\nchange willed is not an action; most often it is a bodily movement,\nthat is to say, a change in the location of one\u2019s body or of\nparts of it. He says that the characterization of willing as\n\u2018setting oneself to cause a change\u2019 has to be wrong.\n\u201cI now think I was mistaken in suggesting that the phrase in use\nfor it is \u2018setting oneself to cause\u2019\u201d (274).\n\nThe reason he gives for abandoning the Cook Wilson picture is that an\naction is an activity, and there is no such activity as that of\noriginating or causing a change in oneself or anything else (273).\nEven if causing a change may require an activity, it is not that\nactivity. Now often we do not know what activity is involved when one\nbody causes a change in another. But when it comes to human actions,\nwe do know. First, we know that we are looking for something mental,\nand second, we know that the word for that special kind of mental\nactivity is \u2018willing\u2019.\n\nVery little can be said about this mental activity of willing, though\nwe are all, of course, perfectly familiar with it. But we can ask\nabout its proper object. What is it that we will? Two possible answers\npresent themselves: we will actions, and we will changes. The first of\nthese must be wrong because it generates an infinite regress. So the\nsecond must be right. An action is the willing of a change.\n6.3 The nature of obligation, or of obligatedness\n\nPrichard\u2019s earliest work does seem to treat rightness or\nobligatoriness as a property of the action to be done, or rather, as a\nproperty of the action once it is done. By 1932, however, as discussed\nin section 3 above, he had moved to the view that obligation is a\nproperty of the agent, not of the act at all. There is some sign in\nhis published paper of that date that he had not yet extended the new\nview to include rightness, i.e. that he had come to distinguish\nrightness, which remained a property of the act and not of the agent,\nfrom obligation or obligatedness, now appearing as a property of the\nagent. For he writes \u2018While the truth could not be expressed by\nsaying \u2018My setting myself to do so-and-so would\nbe right, because I think it would have a certain\neffect\u2019 \u2013 a statement which would be as vicious in\nprinciple as the statement \u2018Doing so-and-so would\nbe right because I think it would be right\u2019\n\u2013 there is nothing to prevent its being expressible in the form\n\u2018I ought to set myself to do so-and-so because I think\nit would have a certain effect\u2019 (99\u2013100). With this\ndistinction the property of obligatoriness vanishes altogether, though\nrightness remains, grounded in the familiar combinations of the\n(objective) nature of the situation and some definite relation in\nwhich the agent stands to others or to himself. However, if this was\nPrichard\u2019s view at the time, no trace of it appears later, and\nRoss appears not to have noticed it at all (see his account of the\nargument of Prichard\u2019s 1932 paper in Ross 1939, ch. 7). And this\nis just as well, because it is very unsettling to be told that one can\nhave an obligation to do an action that is in fact wrong.\n6.4 The content of a moral principle\n\nIn his earliest work Prichard supposes that principles specify\ndistinct obligations, e.g. those of telling the truth, educating\none\u2019s children, serving one\u2019s country. It did not take him\nlong to see that, so understood, pretty well any collection of\nprinciples is going to lead to contradiction and incoherence. He then\nmoved to what looks like a form of what we now know best as\nRoss\u2019s theory of prima facie duties. On this understanding, a\nprinciple specifies what Prichard calls a \u2018claim\u2019 on us,\nfor example that we serve our country \u2013 but all such claims can\nbe defeated by more pressing claims to do something else, such as care\nfor our aging mother. Prichard\u2019s version seems to differ from\nRoss\u2019s, however, at least if we are to trust a letter he wrote\nto Ross in 1932 (to be found in MacAdam, 286\u20137). Ross thinks\nthat duty proper, as he calls it, is a quite different sort of thing\nfrom a prima facie duty; the notion of \u2018duty\u2019 in\n\u2018prima facie duty\u2019 is a different notion from that in\n\u2018duty proper\u2019. Prichard, by contrast, thinks of this as\nincoherent, and opts instead for the view that, expressed in terms of\n\u2018ought\u2019, maintains that, faced with a moral difficulty,\nthere will be different actions each of which in some respect I ought\nto do (this is the prima facie ought) and of those one will be the\naction which I most ought to do, my duty proper. On this picture there\nis no great divide between the \u2018ought\u2019 of duty proper and\nthe \u2018ought\u2019 of prima facie duty.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"ColPriWor\">Collections of Prichard\u2019s works</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"OthRef\">Other references</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1906, \u201cAppearances and Reality,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 15:\n223\u20139.", "1907, \u201cA Criticism of the Psychologists\u2019 Treatment of\nKnowledge,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 16: 27\u201353.", "1909, <em>Kant\u2019s Theory of Knowledge</em>, Oxford: Clarendon\nPress.", "1910, \u201cPhilosophic Pre-Copernicanism: an Answer,\u201d\n<em>Mind</em>, 19: 541\u20133.", "1912, \u201cDoes Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?\u201d\n<em>Mind</em>, 21: 21\u201337.", "1915, \u201cMr. Bertrand Russell on our Knowledge of the External\nWorld,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 24: 145\u201385.", "1919, \u201cProfessor John Cook Wilson,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 28:\n297\u2013318.", "1928, \u201cMr. Bertrand Russell\u2019s <em>Outline of\nPhilosophy</em>,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 37: 265\u201382.", "1929, \u201cDuty and Interest,\u201d Inaugural Lecture (Oxford:\nClarendon Press).", "1932, \u201cDuty and Ignorance of Fact,\u201d Annual\nPhilosophical Lecture, Henrietta Hertz Trust (London: Humphrey\nMilford), pp. 28.", "1935, \u201cThe Meaning of \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\nin the <em>Ethics</em> of Aristotle,\u201d <em>Philosophy</em>, 37:\n27\u201339.", "1938, \u201cThe Sense-datum Fallacy,\u201d <em>Proceedings of\nthe Aristotelian Society</em> (Supplementary Volume), 17:\n1\u201318.", "1944, \u201cH.
