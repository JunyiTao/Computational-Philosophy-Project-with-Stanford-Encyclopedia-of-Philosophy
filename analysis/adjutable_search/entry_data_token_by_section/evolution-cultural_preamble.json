    "main_text": "\n\nResearchers in the field of cultural evolutionary theory pursue an\neclectic program of investigation that lies at the intersection of\ncognitive science, anthropology, and evolutionary biology.\n\u201cCultural Evolutionary Theory\u201d, as we understand it here,\nis most thoroughly exemplified in the ongoing research tradition\ninitiated in the 1970s and early 1980s by Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman\n(1981) on the one hand, and Boyd & Richerson (1985, 2005;\nRicherson & Boyd 2005) on the other.\n\nWhat makes this program cultural (in the eyes of its\nadherents) is its focus on the various ways in which humans\u2014and\nother organisms\u2014learn from other members of their species. These\ncapacities, usually described as forms of \u201csocial\nlearning\u201d, or channels of \u201ccultural inheritance\u201d,\nare explored both as targets of explanation, and as drivers of change.\nIn other words, cultural evolutionary theorists ask questions about\nthe nature and origins of capacities for social learning, and also\nabout the effects of social learning on how populations change and\nadapt over time.\n\nWhat makes this program evolutionary resists any brief\nanswer, but some relevant factors include the following: researchers\nin this tradition often examine how cultural inheritance interacts\nwith the forms of inheritance (especially genetic inheritance) studied\nby mainstream evolutionary theorists; they seek to understand culture\nusing explanatory models and investigative tools adapted from those\nused in evolutionary and ecological theory; they reach back into human\npre-history when determining the origins of the capacity for culture;\nand they ask comparative questions concerning differences between\nspecies in terms of their abilities to create and maintain storehouses\nof valuable socially transmitted information.\n\nThe case in favor of some cultural evolutionary theory is\nirresistible. It is undeniable that members of our own species survive\nand reproduce in part because of habits, know-how and technologies\nthat are not only maintained by learning from others, but that are\nalso generated as part of a cumulative project that builds on\ndiscoveries made by others. Our species also contains sub-groups with\ndifferent habits, different norms, different forms of know-how, and\ndifferent artefactual supports for their ways of life, which are once\nagain generated and maintained through interaction with others. Social\nlearning is also an important agent of adaptation, and perhaps of\nspeciation, in animals. The interesting questions are not so much\nwhether cultural evolution is important, but precisely how theories of\ncultural evolution should be fashioned, and how they should be related\nto more traditional understandings of organic evolution.\n",
