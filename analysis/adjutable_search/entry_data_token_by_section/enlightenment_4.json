    "main_text": "The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment || Science of Man and Subjectivism in the Enlightenment\n1.4 Science of Man and Subjectivism in the Enlightenment\n\nThough Hume finds himself struggling with skepticism in the conclusion\nof Book One of the Treatise, the project of the work as he\noutlines it is not to advance a skeptical viewpoint, but to establish\na science of the mind. Hume is one of many Enlightenment thinkers who\naspire to be the \u201cNewton of the mind\u201d; he aspires to\nestablish the basic laws that govern the elements of the human mind in\nits operations. Alexander Pope\u2019s famous couplet in An Essay\non Man (1733) (\u201cKnow then thyself, presume not God to scan/\nThe proper study of mankind is man\u201d) expresses well the intense\ninterest humanity gains in itself within the context of the\nEnlightenment, as a partial substitute for its traditional interest in\nGod and the transcendent domain. Just as the sun replaces the earth as\nthe center of our cosmos in Copernicus\u2019 cosmological system, so\nhumanity itself replaces God at the center of humanity\u2019s\nconsciousness in the Enlightenment. Given the Enlightenment\u2019s\npassion for science, the self-directed attention naturally takes the\nform of the rise of the scientific study of humanity in the\nperiod.\n\nThe enthusiasm for the scientific study of humanity in the period\nincorporates a tension or paradox concerning the place of humanity in\nthe cosmos, as the cosmos is re-conceived in the context of\nEnlightenment philosophy and science. Newton\u2019s success early in\nthe Enlightenment of subsuming the phenomena of nature under universal\nlaws of motion, expressed in simple mathematical formulae, encourages\nthe conception of nature as a very complicated machine, whose parts\nare material and whose motions and properties are fully accounted for\nby deterministic causal laws. But if our conception of nature is of an\nexclusively material domain governed by deterministic, mechanical\nlaws, and if we at the same time deny the place of the supernatural in\nthe cosmos, then how does humanity itself fit into the cosmos? On the\none hand, the achievements of the natural sciences in general are the\ngreat pride of the Enlightenment, manifesting the excellence of\ndistinctively human capacities. The pride and self-assertiveness of\nhumanity in the Enlightenment expresses itself, among other ways, in\nhumanity\u2019s making the study of itself its central concern. On\nthe other hand, the study of humanity in the Enlightenment typically\nyields a portrait of us that is the opposite of flattering or\nelevating. Instead of being represented as occupying a privileged\nplace in nature, as made in the image of God, humanity is represented\ntypically in the Enlightenment as a fully natural creature, devoid of\nfree will, of an immortal soul, and of a non-natural faculty of\nintelligence or reason. The very title of J.O. de La Mettrie\u2019s\nMan a Machine (1748), for example, seems designed to deflate\nhumanity\u2019s self-conception, and in this respect it is\ncharacteristic of the Enlightenment \u201cscience of man\u201d. It\nis true of a number of works of the Enlightenment, perhaps especially\nworks in the more radical French Enlightenment \u2013 notable here\nare Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s Of the Spirit (1758) and Baron\nd\u2019Holbach\u2019s System of Nature (1770) \u2013 that\nthey at once express the remarkable self-assertiveness of humanity\ncharacteristic of the Enlightenment in their scientific aspirations\nwhile at the same time painting a portrait of humanity that\ndramatically deflates its traditional self-image as occupying a\nprivileged position in nature.\n\nThe methodology of epistemology in the period reflects a similar\ntension. Given the epistemological role of Descartes\u2019 famous\n\u201ccogito, ergo sum\u201d in his system of knowledge,\none might see Descartes\u2019 epistemology as already marking the\ntransition from an epistemology privileging knowledge of God to one\nthat privileges self-knowledge instead. However, in Descartes\u2019\nepistemology, it remains true that knowledge of God serves as the\nnecessary foundation for all human knowledge. Hume\u2019s\nTreatise displays such a re-orientation less ambiguously. As\nnoted, Hume means his work to comprise a science of the mind or of\nman. In the Introduction, Hume describes the science of man as\neffectively a foundation for all the sciences since all sciences\n\u201clie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their\npowers and faculties.\u201d In other words, since all science is\nhuman knowledge, scientific knowledge of humanity is the\nfoundation of the sciences. Hume\u2019s placing the science of man at\nthe foundation of all the sciences both exemplifies the privilege\nafforded to \u201cmankind\u2019s study of man\u201d within the\nEnlightenment and provides an interpretation of it. But Hume\u2019s\nmethodological privileging of humanity in the system of sciences\ncontrasts sharply with what he says in the body of his science about\nhumanity. In Hume\u2019s science of man, reason as a faculty of\nknowledge is skeptically attacked and marginalized; reason is\nattributed to other animals as well; belief is shown to be grounded in\ncustom and habit; and free will is denied. So, even as knowledge of\nhumanity supplants knowledge of God as the keystone of the system of\nknowledge, the scientific perspective on humanity starkly challenges\nhumankind\u2019s self-conception as occupying a privileged position\nin the order of nature.\n\nImmanuel Kant explicitly enacts a revolution in epistemology modeled\non the Copernican in astronomy. As characteristic of Enlightenment\nepistemology, Kant, in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781,\nsecond edition 1787) undertakes both to determine the limits of our\nknowledge, and at the same time to provide a foundation of scientific\nknowledge of nature, and he attempts to do this by examining our human\nfaculties of knowledge critically. Even as he draws strict limits to\nrational knowledge, he attempts to defend reason as a faculty of\nknowledge, as playing a necessary role in natural science, in the face\nof skeptical challenges that reason faces in the period. According to\nKant, scientific knowledge of nature is not merely knowledge of what\nin fact happens in nature, but knowledge of the causal laws\nof nature according to which what in fact happens must\nhappen. But how is knowledge of necessary causal connection in nature\npossible? Hume\u2019s investigation of the idea of cause had made\nclear that we cannot know causal necessity through experience;\nexperience teaches us at most what in fact happens, not what\nmust happen. In addition, Kant\u2019s own earlier critique\nof principles of rationalism had convinced him that the principles of\n(\u201cgeneral\u201d) logic also cannot justify knowledge of\nreal necessary connections (in nature); the formal principle\nof non-contradiction can ground at best the deduction of one\nproposition from another, but not the claim that one\nproperty or event must follow from another in the\ncourse of nature. The generalized epistemological problem Kant\naddresses in the Critique of Pure Reason is: how is science\npossible (including natural science, mathematics, metaphysics), given\nthat all such knowledge must be (or include) knowledge of real,\nsubstantive (not merely logical or formal) necessities. Put in the\nterms Kant defines, the problem is: how is synthetic, a priori\nknowledge possible?\n\nAccording to Kant\u2019s Copernican Revolution in epistemology\naddressed to this problem, objects must conform themselves to human\nknowledge rather than knowledge to objects. Certain cognitive forms\nlie ready in the human mind \u2013 prominent examples are the pure\nconcepts of substance and cause and the forms of intuition, space and\ntime; given sensible representations must conform themselves to these\nforms in order for human experience (as empirical knowledge of nature)\nto be possible at all. We can acquire scientific knowledge of nature\nbecause we constitute it a priori according to certain cognitive\nforms; for example, we can know nature as a causally ordered domain\nbecause we originally synthesize a priori the given manifold of\nsensibility according to the category of causality, which has its\nsource in the human mind.\n\nKant saves rational knowledge of nature by limiting rational knowledge\nto nature. According to Kant\u2019s argument, we can have rational\nknowledge only of the domain of possible experience, not of\nsupersensible objects such as God and the soul. Moreover Kant\u2019s\nsolution brings with it a kind of idealism: given the mind\u2019s\nrole in constituting objects of experience, we know objects only as\nappearances, only as they appear according to our faculties,\nnot as they are in themselves. This is the subjectivism of\nKant\u2019s epistemology. Kant\u2019s epistemology exemplifies\nEnlightenment thought by replacing the theocentric conception of\nknowledge of the rationalist tradition with an anthropocentric\nconception.\n\nHowever, Kant means his system to make room for humanity\u2019s\npractical and religious aspirations toward the transcendent as well.\nAccording to Kant\u2019s idealism, the realm of nature is limited to\na realm of appearances, and we can intelligibly think supersensible\nobjects such as God, freedom and the soul, though we cannot know them.\nThrough the postulation of a realm of unknowable noumena (things in\nthemselves) over against the realm of nature as a realm of\nappearances, Kant manages to make place for practical concepts that\nare central to our understanding of ourselves even while grounding our\nscientific knowledge of nature as a domain governed by deterministic\ncausal laws. Though Kant\u2019s idealism is highly controversial from\nits initial publication, a main point in its favor, according to Kant\nhimself, is that it reconciles, in a single coherent tension, the main\ntension between the Enlightenment\u2019s conception of nature, as\nordered according to deterministic causal laws, and the\nEnlightenment\u2019s conception of ourselves, as morally free, as\nhaving dignity, and as perfectible.\n",
