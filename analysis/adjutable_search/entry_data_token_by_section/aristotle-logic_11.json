A deduction is perfect if it\n\u201cneeds no external term in order to show the necessary\nresult\u201d (24b23\u201324), and it is imperfect if it \u201cneeds\none or several in addition that are necessary because of the terms\nsupposed but were not assumed through premises\u201d\n(24b24\u201325). The precise interpretation of this distinction is\ndebatable, but it is at any rate clear that Aristotle regards the\nperfect deductions as not in need of proof in some sense. For\nimperfect deductions, Aristotle does give proofs, which invariably\ndepend on the perfect deductions. Thus, with some reservations, we\nmight compare the perfect deductions to the axioms or primitive rules\nof a deductive system.\n\nIn the proofs for imperfect deductions, Aristotle says that he\n\u201creduces\u201d (anagein) each case to one of the\nperfect forms and that they are thereby \u201ccompleted\u201d or\n\u201cperfected\u201d. These completions are either\nprobative (deiktikos: a modern translation\nmight be \u201cdirect\u201d) or through the\nimpossible (dia to adunaton).\n\nA direct deduction is a series of steps leading from the premises to\nthe conclusion, each of which is either a conversion\nof a previous step or an inference from two previous steps relying on\na first-figure deduction. Conversion, in turn, is inferring from a\nproposition another which has the subject and predicate interchanged.\nSpecifically, Aristotle argues that three such conversions are\nsound: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nEab &\\rightarrow Eba \\\\\n Iab &\\rightarrow Iba \\\\\n Aab &\\rightarrow Iba \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nHe undertakes to justify these in An. Pr. I.2. From a modern\nstandpoint, the third is sometimes regarded with suspicion. Using it\nwe can get Some monsters are chimeras from the apparently\ntrue All chimeras are monsters; but the former is often\nconstrued as implying in turn There is something which is a\nmonster and a chimera, and thus that there are monsters and there\nare chimeras. In fact, this simply points up something about\nAristotle\u2019s system: Aristotle in effect supposes that\nall terms in syllogisms are non-empty. (For further\ndiscussion of this point, see the entry on the\n square of opposition).\n\nAs an example of the procedure, we may take Aristotle\u2019s proof of\nCamestres. He says:\n\nIf \\(M\\) belongs to every \\(N\\) but to no \\(X\\), then neither will\n\\(N\\) belong to any \\(X\\). For if \\(M\\) belongs to no \\(X\\), then\nneither does \\(X\\) belong to any \\(M\\); but \\(M\\) belonged to every\n\\(N\\); therefore, \\(X\\) will belong to no \\(N\\) (for the first figure\nhas come about). And since the privative converts, neither will \\(N\\)\nbelong to any \\(X\\). (An. Pr. I.5, 27a9\u201312)\n\n\nFrom this text, we can extract an exact formal proof, as follows:\n\n\n\nStep\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJustification\nAristotle\u2019s Text \n\n1. \\(MaN\\)\n\u00a0\nIf \\(M\\) belongs to every \\(N\\) \n\n2. \\(MeX\\)\n\u00a0\nbut to no \\(X\\), \n\nTo prove:\n\n\\(NeX\\)\n\u00a0\nthen neither will \\(N\\) belong to any \\(X\\). \n\n3. \\(MeX\\)\n(2, premise)\nFor if \\(M\\) belongs to no \\(X\\), \n\n4. \\(XeM\\)\n(3, conversion of \\(e\\))\nthen neither does \\(X\\) belong to any \\(M\\); \n\n5. \\(MaN\\)\n(1, premise)\nbut \\(M\\) belonged to every \\(N\\); \n\n6. \\(XeN\\)\n(4, 5, Celarent)\ntherefore, \\(X\\) will belong to no \\(N\\) (for the first\nfigure has come about). \n\n7. \\(NeX\\)\n(6, conversion of \\(e\\))\nAnd since the privative converts, neither will \\(N\\) belong\nto any \\(X\\).  \n\n\nA completion or proof \u201cthrough the impossible\u201d shows that\na certain conclusion follows from a pair of premises by assuming as a\nthird premise the denial of that conclusion and giving a deduction,\nfrom it and one of the original premises, the denial (or the contrary)\nof the other premises. This is the deduction of an\n\u201cimpossible\u201d, and Aristotle\u2019s proof ends at that\npoint. An example is his proof of Baroco in\n27a36\u2013b1:\n\n\n\nStep\nJustification\nAristotle\u2019s Text \n\n1. \\(MaN\\)\n\u00a0\nNext, if \\(M\\) belongs to every \\(N\\), \n\n2. \\(MoX\\)\n\u00a0\nbut does not belong to some \\(X\\), \n\nTo prove: \\(NoX\\)\n\u00a0\nthen it is necessary for \\(N\\) not to belong to some\n\\(X\\) \n\n3. \\(NaX\\)\nContradictory of the desired conclusion\nFor if it belongs to all, \n\n4. \\(MaN\\)\nRepetition of premise 1\nand \\(M\\) is predicated of every \\(N\\), \n\n5. \\(MaX\\)\n(3, 4, Barbara)\nthen it is necessary that \\(M\\) belongs to every\n\\(X\\). \n\n6. \\(MoX\\)\n(5 is the contradictory of 2)\nBut it was assumed not to belong to some. \n\n\n",
