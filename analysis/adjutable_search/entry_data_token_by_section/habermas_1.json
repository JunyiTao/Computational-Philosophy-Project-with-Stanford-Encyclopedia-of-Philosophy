    "main_text": "Biography || The Public Sphere\n1.2 The Public Sphere\n\nThe public sphere is one of Habermas\u2019s most well-known concepts,\nintroduced in his habilitation thesis, published in 1962 as The\nStructural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a\nCategory of Bourgeois Society. Belonging to neither the state,\nthe economy, nor the family, the public sphere is where private\nindividuals come together to communicate about matters of general\nconcern. It is the location of the public use of reason and the place\nwhere \u201cpublic opinion\u201d is formed. Structural\nTransformation is a reconstructed history of the rise and fall of\nthe public sphere focused on Britain, France, and Germany from the\nearly modern era to the mid-twentieth century. In the Middle Ages,\nthere was a merely \u201crepresentative\u201d public sphere, in\nwhich kings and nobles displayed their status before society (1962\n[1989: 7\u201310]). The bourgeois public sphere begins to emerge in\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at first in the guise of a\nliterary public sphere. In coffee houses, salons, and literary\nsocieties, the new reading public came together to discuss\nnovels\u2014Habermas cites Samuel Richardson\u2019s Pamela\nas an example (1962 [1989: 31\u20136, 49\u201350, 174]). Skills of\ncritical reasoning first developed in the journals of the literary\npublic sphere were subsequently applied to the political public\nsphere, where public affairs rather than literary texts are the\nobjects of criticism. In this period the modern state was emerging, as\npolitical authority was gradually depersonalized and vested in\nmore-or-less independent bureaucratic institutions, rather than the\nperson of the monarch (1962 [1989: 17\u20138]). Simultaneously, the\ndevelopment of mercantile capitalism endowed merchants with\nunprecedented wealth and influence, and an ever-greater need for\naccurate information about market conditions. This need was met by\nnews-sheets and gazettes, which soon turned their attention to state\npolicy as much as commodity prices (1962 [1989: 20\u20132]). The\nbourgeois public sphere thus developed concomitantly with both the\ncapitalist economy and the Westphalian sovereign state, and flourished\nduring the high point of bourgeois-liberal politics in the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries.\n\nThe bourgeois public sphere is constituted by an ideological\nseparation between public and private. The state and politics are\ndeemed \u201cpublic\u201d, whereas civil society, the market\neconomy, and the family are deemed \u201cprivate\u201d. The public\nsphere, according to Habermas, mediates between these two realms (1962\n[1989: 30]). Participants in the bourgeois public sphere are\nprivate individuals, coming together to rationally and\ncritically discuss public affairs, above all the actions of\ngovernments; it is\n\n\na realm of private individuals assembled into a public body who as\ncitizens transmit the needs of bourgeois society to the state, in\norder, ideally, to transform political into \u201crational\u201d\nauthority within the medium of this public sphere. (1964 [1974:\n53])\n\n\nHabermas would later refer to this as the generation of\n\u201ccommunicative power\u201d, which can legitimate the political\nsystem\u2019s actions if yoked to the latter\u2019s\n\u201cadministrative power\u201d (1992b [1996b: 147\u201350]). As\nmembers of the public, private individuals bring decisions into the\npublic sphere where they are open to rational discussion and\ncriticism. In the process, participants form and articulate the\ngeneral interest of society, drawing on ideas of truth, justice and\nhuman rights.\n\nNeedless to say, participants in the bourgeois public sphere were\nde facto almost all educated male property-owning members of\nthe bourgeoisie, along with some sympathisers from the aristocracy.\nHabermas has acknowledged the selective membership of the bourgeois\npublic sphere during its heyday (1992c: 425\u2013430), although\ncritics have charged that he does not pay sufficient attention to the\nway it was constituted by excluding propertyless workers\n(Negt & Kluge 1972 [2016]) and, above all, women (Landes 1988).\nDespite its limitations, Habermas argues that the bourgeois public\nsphere nevertheless embodied certain principles and ideals, never\nfully realized, that are vital to any flourishing democratic society.\nIt was thus both an \u201cideal\u201d and an \u201cideology\u201d\n(1962 [1989: 112]). Since differences in social status between\ninterlocutors were bracketed as \u201cprivate\u201d matters (1962\n[1989: 36]) the public sphere was in theory universal, open to any\nliterate person (1962 [1989: 37]). This ensured that rational\nargumentation was calibrated to universal standards of validity, not\nto the relative status of interlocutors, and could function as a\ncooperative search for truth and justice (1962 [1989: 54]).\n\nHabermas\u2019s approach in this early work can be described as one\nof historical reconstruction in the service of internal criticism. He\nreconstructs an \u201cideal type\u201d of the bourgeois public\nsphere, in order to criticize the really existing public spheres of\nmodern democracies.\n\nThe structural transformation which marks the beginning of the end of\nthe bourgeois public sphere involves a re-definition of the\npublic/private distinction. Under conditions of mid-twentieth century\n\u201cwelfare-state mass democracy\u201d, (1962 [1989: 208]) state\nand society became ever more entangled as governments pursued\ninterventionist economic policies and expanded welfare provision. At\nthe same time, non-state actors such as pressure groups, corporations,\nand political parties played an increasing role in governance (1962\n[1989: 142]). Habermas refers to this process as\n\u201crefeudalization\u201d (1962 [1989: 200\u20131]).\n\nHabermas sees the modern public sphere as, in many ways, the victim of\nits own success. As it expanded far beyond its original basis of\neducated male property-owners, material inequalities could no longer\nbe set aside, but rather became the subject of public debate (1962\n[1989: 127]). And this debate was no longer a matter of\nrational-critical analysis of state action by the assembled public,\nbut of negotiation between interest groups which bypass public reason.\nInstead of the approximation of society to the ideal type, what\nemerged was an impoverished pseudo-public sphere, lacking its original\ncapacity for rational-critical discourse, easily manipulated by\nstates, corporations, and interest groups using the techniques of\n\u201cpublic relations\u201d (1962 [1989: 176, 236]). Its role now,\nas in the feudal era, is to acclaim decisions which have already been\nmade.\n\nHabermas continues to make use of the concept of the public sphere in\nhis later works (1973a [1975: 37\u20138, 48]; 1992b [1996b]),\ndeveloping a detailed account of its place in modern societies (1992b\n[1996b: 359\u201387]; 2008b [2009: chapters 8 & 9]). In his\noriginal formulation, there was a tendency to assume the existence of\na single unified public sphere for a single polity. In response to\nNancy Fraser\u2019s discussion of \u201csubaltern\ncounterpublics\u201d (Fraser 1992) and acknowledging his own earlier\nneglect of \u201cplebian public spheres\u201d, Habermas now concedes\nthat there may be a multitude of intersecting public spheres within a\ngiven society, focusing on different communities and topics but with\nporous boundaries that allow flows of communication to pass between\nthem (1992c: 424\u20135; 1992b [1996b: 373\u20134]). The closest\nthing to a \u201cuniversal\u201d public sphere is the political\npublic sphere, focused on the political system. The political public\nsphere acts as a \u201csounding board\u201d for problems which\naffect society as a whole, as well as a \u201cfilter-bed\u201d,\nfiltering out contributions to public discourse which represent\ngeneralizable interests (2008b chapter 11 [2009: chapter 9, 143]). In\nthis manner, reflexive public opinion is formed and communicative\npower is generated. One of the most salient features of the\ncontemporary political public is its division into\n\u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinformal\u201d segments, the former\ndenoting the highly regulated discourse of elected politicians,\njudges, parliaments, and courts, and the latter the\n\u201cwild\u201d, unregulated flows of communication outside these\nspaces (2008b chapter 11 [2009: chapter 9, 159\u201362]). Habermas\nargues that the right kind of feedback between formal and informal\npublic spheres is vital for legitimating the political system\u2019s\nactions. At the same time, there is no reason to think that public\nspheres must stop at national borders. In an increasingly\ninterdependent world, global attention can be focused on single\nissues\u2014Habermas mentions the wars in Vietnam and Iraq as\nexamples\u2014creating, at least temporarily, a transnational public\nsphere (2004: chapter 3 [2006c: 39\u201348]). The political\nlegitimacy of transnational polities like the EU hinges on whether the\npublic spheres of its member states can act together, functioning as a\nEuropean public sphere (2008b chapter 9, chapter 11 [2009: chapter 6,\n87\u20138, chapter 9, 181\u20133]).\n",
