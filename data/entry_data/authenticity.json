    "preamble": "\n\nThe term \u2018authentic\u2019 is used either in the strong sense of\nbeing \u201cof undisputed origin or authorship\u201d, or in a weaker\nsense of being \u201cfaithful to an original\u201d or a\n\u201creliable, accurate representation\u201d. To say that something\nis authentic is to say that it is what it professes to be, or what it\nis reputed to be, in origin or authorship. But the distinction between\nauthentic and derivative is more complicated when discussing\nauthenticity as a characteristic attributed to human beings. For in\nthis case, the question arises: What is it to be oneself, at one with\noneself, or truly representing one\u2019s self? The multiplicity of\npuzzles that arise in conjunction with the conception of authenticity\nconnects with metaphysical, epistemological, and moral issues (for\nrecent discussion, see Newman and Smith 2016; Heldke and Thomsen\n2014). On the one hand, being oneself is inescapable, since whenever\none makes a choice or acts, it is oneself who is doing these things.\nBut on the other hand, we are sometimes inclined to say that some of\nthe thoughts, decisions and actions that we undertake are not\nreally one\u2019s own and are therefore not genuinely\nexpressive of who one is. Here, the issue is no longer of metaphysical\nnature, but rather about moral-psychology, identity and\nresponsibility.\n\nWhen used in this latter sense, the characterization describes a\nperson who acts in accordance with desires, motives, ideals or beliefs\nthat are not only hers (as opposed to someone else\u2019s), but that\nalso express who she really is. Bernard Williams captures this when he\nspecifies authenticity as \u201cthe idea that some things are in some\nsense really you, or express what you are, and others\naren\u2019t\u201d (quoted in Guignon 2004: viii).\n\nBesides being a topic in philosophical debates, authenticity is also a\npervasive ideal that impacts social and political thinking.\nIn fact, one distinctive feature of recent Western intellectual\ndevelopments has been a shift to what is called the \u201cage of\nauthenticity\u201d (Taylor 2007; Ferrarra 1998). Therefore,\nunderstanding the concept also involves investigating its historical\nand philosophical sources and on the way it impacts the\nsocio-political outlook of contemporary societies.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Origins and Meaning of the Concept of Authenticity\n1.1 Sincerity and Authenticity\n\nA number of significant cultural changes in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries led to the emergence of a new ideal in the\nWestern world (Trilling 1972). During this period, human beings came\nto be thought of more as individuals than as placeholders in systems\nof social relations. This emphasis on the importance of the individual\nis seen in the prevalence of autobiographies and self-portraits, where\nthe individual becomes the centre of attention not because of\nextraordinary feats or access to special knowledge, but because he or\nshe is an individual.\n\nIn the same period, society comes to be seen not as an organic whole\nof interacting components, but as an aggregate of individual human\nbeings, a social system with a life of its own, which presents itself\nto the individual as not itself quite human but rather as artificial,\nthe result of a \u201csocial contract\u201d. Being human is\nunderstood as being best achieved through being unique and\ndistinctive, even when these collide with certain social norms. At the\nsame time, there is an increasing awareness of what Charles Taylor\n(1989) calls \u201cinwardness\u201d or \u201cinternal space\u201d.\nThe result is a distinction between one\u2019s private and unique\nindividuality, and one\u2019s public self (Taylor 1991; Trilling\n1972).\n\nWith these social changes there is a sharp shift in the conceptions of\napprobation and disapproval that are commonly used in judging others\nand oneself. For instance, concepts like sincerity and honor become\nobsolescent (Berger 1970). In earlier times, a sincere person was seen\nas someone who honestly attempts to neither violate the expectations\nthat follow from the position he holds in society, nor to strive to\nappear otherwise than he ought to. However, by the time of Hegel, the\nideal of sincerity had lost its normative appeal. Hegel polemically\nrefers to sincerity as \u201cthe heroism of dumb service\u201d\n(Hegel 2002 [1807]: 515) and launches an attack on the bourgeois\n\u201chonest man,\u201d who passively internalizes a particular\nconventional social ethos. In the condition of sincerity, the\nindividual is uncritically obedient to the power of society\u2014a\nconformity that for Hegel leads to subjugation and a deterioration of\nthe individual (Hegel 2002 [1807]; Golomb 1995: 9; Trilling 1972). For\nHegel, in the progress of \u201cspirit\u201d, the individual\nconsciousness will eventually move from this condition of sincerity to\na condition of baseness, in which the individual becomes antagonistic\nto external societal powers and achieves a measure of autonomy. Hegel\nshows this clearly in a comment on Diderot\u2019s Rameau\u2019s\nNephew, a story in which the narrator (supposedly Diderot\nhimself) is portrayed as the reasonable, sincere man who respects the\nprevailing order and who has achieved bourgeois respectability. In\ncontrast, the nephew is full of contempt for the society in which he\nfigures as a worthless person. However, he is in opposition to\nhimself, because he still aspires to a better standing in a society,\nwhich he believes has nothing but emptiness to offer (Despland 1975:\n360; Golomb 1995: 13\u201315). For Hegel, the narrator is an example\nof the sincere, honest soul, while the nephew figures as the\n\u201cdisintegrated,\u201d alienated consciousness. The nephew is\nclearly alienated, but for Hegel this alienation is a step in the\nprogression towards autonomous existence (Williams 2002: 190).\n\nIn the midst of this conceptual change, the term\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 becomes applicable in demarcating a\nsomewhat new set of virtues. The older concept of sincerity, referring\nto being truthful in order to be honest in one\u2019s dealings with\nothers, comes to be replaced by a relatively new concept of\nauthenticity, understood as being true to oneself for one\u2019s own\nbenefit. Earlier, the moral advice to be authentic recommended that\none should be true to oneself in order thereby to be true to\nothers. Thus, being true to oneself is seen as a means to the\nend of successful social relations. In contrast, in our contemporary\nthinking, authenticity as a virtue term is seen as referring to a way\nof acting that is choiceworthy in itself (Ferrara 1993; Varga 2011a;\nVarga 2011b).\n1.2 Autonomy and Authenticity\n\nThe growing appeal of the idea of authenticity has led to the\nemergence of a highly influential modern \u201cethic of\nauthenticity\u201d (Ferrara 1993; Ferrara 2017). This ethic\nacknowledges the value of the dominant \u201cethic of autonomy\u201d\nthat shapes modern moral thought (Schneewind 1998; Dworkin 1988). The\nidea of autonomy emphasizes the individual\u2019s self-governing\nabilities, the independence of one\u2019s deliberation from\nmanipulation and the capacity to decide for oneself. It is connected\nto the view that moral principles and the legitimacy of political\nauthority should be grounded in the self-governing individual who is\nfree from diverse cultural and social pressures. According to the\nethic of autonomy, each individual should follow those norms he or she\ncan will on the basis of rational reflective endorsement. To some\nextent, authenticity and autonomy agree in supposing that one should\nstrive to lead one\u2019s life according to one\u2019s own reasons\nand motives, relying on one\u2019s capacity to follow\nself-imposed guidelines. In both cases, it is crucial that\none has the ability to put one\u2019s own behavior under reflexive\nscrutiny and make it dependent on self-determined goals (Honneth\n1994).\n\nOne crucial difference is that the ethic of authenticity introduces\nthe idea that there are motives, desires and commitments that\nsometimes should outweigh the restrictions of rational reflection.\nThis is because those motives are so fundamental to the cohesion of\none\u2019s own identity that overriding them would mean\ndisintegrating the very self which is necessary to be a moral agent.\nThe point is that there are types of moral philosophical reasoning\nthat can be repressive if they arise from \u201can autonomous moral\nconscience not complemented by sensitivity to the equilibrium of\nidentity and by authenticity\u201d (Ferrara 1993: 102). Besides\nleading an autonomous life, guided by one\u2019s own, non-constrained\nreasons and motives, authenticity requires that these motives and\nreasons should be expressive of one\u2019s self-identity.\nAuthenticity guides the moral agent to follow only those \u201cmoral\nsources outside the subject [that speak in a language] which\nresonate[s] within him or her\u201d, in other words, moral\nsources that accord with \u201can order which is inseparably indexed\nto a personal vision\u201d (Taylor 1989: 510). Hence, authenticity\nentails an aspect that lies beyond the scope of autonomy, namely, a\n\u201clanguage of personal resonance\u201d (Taylor 1991: 90). This\npoints to the gap between (Kantian) autonomy and authenticity: one can\nlead an autonomous life, even if this way of living fails to express a\nperson\u2019s self-understanding.\n\nIn recent years, more attention has been devoted to highlighting how\nautonomy and authenticity can come apart (e.g. Oshana 2007; Roessler\n2012; MacKay forthcoming). Some argue that authenticity demands more\nthan is necessary for autonomy: a person does not have to reflectively\nendorse key aspects of her identity in order to qualify as autonomous\n(Oshana 2007). If she acknowledges that aspects of her identity\ncontradict her self-conception, she might still be autonomous, even if\nthis acknowledgement injects ambivalence into her life.\n\nIn all, the ideal of authenticity does not object to the importance of\nthe self-given law, but disagrees that full freedom consists in making\nand following such a law (Menke 2005: 308). It is not just about being\ninvolved in the authorship of such a law, but about how this law fits\nwith the wholeness of a person\u2019s life, and how or whether it\nexpresses who the person is. In this sense, the idea of autonomy\nalready represents a counterposition to an ethic that is solely\nconcerned with strict adherence to social norms.\n1.3 Authenticity and the self\n\nAnother decisive factor in the development of the ideal of\nauthenticity was that it emerged together with a distinctively modern\nconception of the self. This is visible in the work of Rousseau, who\nargues that the orientation toward life that should guide the conduct\none chooses should come from a source within. This led to questions\nabout inwardness, self-reflection and introspection, many of them\naddressed in his Confessions (1770). When the space of\ninteriority becomes a guiding authority, the individual must detect\nand distinguish central impulses, feelings and wishes from ones that\nare less central or conflict with one\u2019s central motives. In\nother words, interiority must be divided into what is at the core and\nwhat is peripheral. In this picture, the measure of one\u2019s\nactions is whether they spring from and express essential aspects of\none\u2019s identity or whether they come from a peripheral place.\n\nSuch a conception of the self exhibits decisive parallels to the\ntradition of \u201creligious individualism\u201d that centers\nreligious life on the individual and stresses the importance of\ninwardness and the introspective examination of one\u2019s inner\nmotives, intentions and conscience. Investigating the characteristics\nof the modern subject of inwardness, Foucault (1980: 58\u201360)\nsuggests that \u201cit seems to us that truth, lodged in our most\nsecret nature, \u2018demands\u2019 only to surface.\u201d For\nFoucault, confession\u2014the look inward to monitor one\u2019s\ninterior life and to tell certain \u201ctruths\u201d about\noneself\u2014has become a part of a cultural life, reaching from\nreligious contexts to psychological therapy. The radicalization of the\ndistinction between true and false interiority has led to new\npossibilities; inner states, motivations and feelings are now\nincreasingly thought of as objectifiable and malleable in different\ncontexts.\n\nRousseau also adds that acting on motives that spring from the\nperiphery of the self, while ignoring or denying essential aspects of\none\u2019s self, simply amounts to self-betrayal and annihilation of\nthe self. Rousseau\u2019s The New Heloise (1997 [1761])\nemphasizes this aspect by showing how the novel accentuates the\nsignificant costs and the potential self-alienation involved in\nsuppressing one\u2019s deepest motivations. But, in addition, in the\nDiscourse on the Origin of Inequality, Rousseau argues that,\nwith the emergence of a competitive public sphere, the ability to turn\ninward is increasingly compromised, because competitive relations\nrequire intense role-playing, which Rousseau calls an \u201cexcessive\nlabor\u201d (Rousseau 1992 [1754]: 22). The ongoing instrumental\nrole-playing not only causes alienation, but ultimately inequality and\ninjustice, since it destroys the immanent moral understanding with\nwhich, according to Rousseau, humans are hard-wired. Social life\nrequires identification with social roles, but because role identity\nis determined by other people\u2019s normative expectations,\nrole-playing leads to a tension that might be understood as a matter\nof politics more than anything else (Schmid 2017). \n2. Critique of Authenticity\n\nThe idea of autonomy\u2014the view that each individual must decide\nhow to act based on his or her own rational deliberations about the\nbest course of action\u2014has in many ways paved the way for the\nidea of authenticity. However, authenticity goes beyond autonomy by\nholding that an individual\u2019s feelings and deepest desires can\noutweigh both the outcome of rational deliberation in making\ndecisions, and our willingness to immerse ourselves into the reigning\nnorms and values of society. Whereas sincerity generally seems to\naccept a given social order, authenticity becomes an implicitly\ncritical concept, often calling into question the reigning social\norder and public opinion. In Rousseau\u2019s optic, one of our most\nimportant projects is to avert from the social sphere and to unearth\nwhat is truly us underneath the \u2018masks\u2019 that\nsociety forces on us. But when authenticity comes to be regarded as\nsomething like sincerity for its own sake (Ferrara 1993: 86), it\nbecomes increasingly hard to see what the moral good is that it is\nsupposed to bring into being.\n\nA frequently mentioned worry with the ideal of authenticity is that\nthe focus on one\u2019s own inner feelings and attitudes may breed a\nself-centered preoccupation with oneself that is anti-social and\ndestructive of altruism and compassion toward others. Christopher\nLasch (1979) points out similarities between the clinical disorder\nreferred to as Narcissistic Personality Disorder and authenticity.\nAccording to Lasch, narcissism and authenticity are both characterized\nby deficient empathic skills, self-indulgence and self-absorbed\nbehavior. Similarly, Allan Bloom (1987: 61) maintains that the culture\nof authenticity has made the minds of the youth \u201cnarrower and\nflatter,\u201d leading to self-centeredness and the collapse of the\npublic self. While Lasch and Bloom worry about the threat that the\nself-centeredness and narcissism of the \u201cculture of\nauthenticity\u201d poses to morality and political coherence, Daniel\nBell voices worries about its economic viability. What Bell fears is\nthat the \u201cmegalomania of self-infinitization\u201d that comes\nwith the culture of authenticity will erode the foundations of market\nmechanisms that are \u201cbased on a moral system of reward rooted in\nthe Protestant sanctification of work\u201d (Bell 1976: 84). More\nrecently, critics have argued that when properly analyzed,\nauthenticity demands positing the existence of a \u201ctrue\nself.\u201d It requires positing an essentialist structure leading to\nmetaphysical problems that current accounts of authenticity fail to\nsolve (Bialystok 2014). Correspondingly, Feldman (2014) argues in\nfavor of abandoning the ideal of authenticity because it builds on\nconfused assumptions about the self, the value of one\u2019s\n\u201cgut feelings\u201d in revealing one\u2019s values, and the\nsupposedly corrupting influence of the \u201cexternal\u201d social\nrealm (for a critique of this position, see Bauer 2017; Ferrara 2009)\n\n\nHowever, one might argue that this only becomes a problem if one\nthinks of authenticity as entirely a personal virtue. In other words,\nthere is only a clash between morality and social life and being\nauthentic if the \u201ctrue\u201d self is regarded as fundamentally\nprone to anti-social behaviour. But many thinkers at this time\nunderstood human nature as fundamentally disposed toward beneficence,\nso that evil was seen as arising from socialization and upbringing\nrather than from deep drives within the human being. For instance,\nRousseau holds that certain immoral characteristics are immanent in\nman but were produced by the dynamics of modern society, which is\ncharacterized by a competitive way of relating to others and striving\nfor acknowledgement in the public sphere. Rousseau thus externalizes\nthe origins of societal evil and alienation from the original nature\nof man. The undistorted self-relation of natural man inspires sympathy\nand considerate relations with others, sensitive to \u201cseeing any\nsentient being, especially our fellow-man, perish or suffer,\nprincipally those like ourselves\u201d (Rousseau 1992 [1754]: 14). In\nsomewhat the same way, economic theorists of the time supposed that\nunregulated markets are self-correcting, as human beings are naturally\ninclined to engage in mutually advantageous commercial activities\n(Taylor 2007: 221\u2013269). On this view, authenticity does not\namount to egoism or self-absorption. On the contrary, the prevailing\nview seems to have been that, by turning inward and accessing the\n\u201ctrue\u201d self, one is simultaneously led towards a deeper\nengagement with the social world. This is why Taylor (1989:\n419\u2013455) describes the trajectory of the project of authenticity\nis \u201cinward and upward\u201d.\n\nIt might however be objected that supposing that the\n\u201cinner\u201d is a morally worthy guide is deeply misguided and\nbuilds upon an overly optimistic idea of human nature. It may be\nargued that once the idea of rational deliberation is set aside, the\npowerful impact of the non-rational becomes apparent. Thinkers such as\nNietzsche and Freud have put in question the conception of human\nnature, and especially of our \u201cinner\u201d nature, as\nfundamentally good. Following their \u201chermeneutics of\nsuspicion\u201d (Ricoeur 1970), human nature comes to be seen as\nincluding forces of violence, disorder and unreason as well as\ntendencies toward beneficence and altruism. In that case, any idea of\nan ethic based primarily on the ideal of authenticity is simply\nuntenable.\n\nOthers have expressed serious concerns not about the optimistic view\nof human nature, but about the conception of the self that underlies\nthe idea of authenticity. Some argued that the dichotomies that the\nconcept authenticity was built on, like conformity vs. independence,\nindividual vs. society, or inner-directedness vs. other-directedness,\nwere entirely misguided. The underlying assumption that considers the\nindividual separate from the environment is an absurd assumption that\nerodes that bond between the individual and community, which\nultimately is the source of the authentic self (Slater 1970: 15; Sisk\n1973). In agreement with Slater (1970) and Yankelovich (1981), Bellah\net al. (1985) and Fairlie (1978) contend that such a pursuit of\nauthenticity is self-defeating, for with the loss of the bond with\ncommunity, the sense of self is also diminished.\n\nAdditionally, in The Jargon of Authenticity, Adorno contended\nthat the \u201cliturgy of inwardness\u201d is founded on the flawed\nidea of a self-transparent individual who is capable of choosing\nherself (Adorno 1973: 70). The doubtful picture of the self-centered\nindividual covers up the constitutive alterity and mimetic nature of\nthe self. In the concluding part of The Order of Things,\nFoucault maintained that present society was witnessing a crisis, not\nonly of authenticity but also of the whole idea of the subject in its\ntemporary historically contingent constitution, foreseeing that\n\u201cman would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of\nthe sea\u201d (Foucault 1994: 387). Foucault clearly opposed the idea\nof a hidden authentic self, which he critically referred to as the\n\u201cCalifornian cult of the self\u201d (1983: 266). The\nrecognition that the subject is not given to itself in advance leads\nhim to the practical consequence that it must create itself as a work\nof art (Foucault 1983: 392). Rather than searching for a hidden true\nself, one should attempt to shape one\u2019s life as a work of art,\nproceeding without recourse to any fixed rules or permanent truths in\na process of unending becoming (Foucault 1988: 49). In a similar vein,\nRichard Rorty has argued that the idea of coming to \u201cknow a\ntruth which was out there (or in here) all the time\u201d (Rorty\n1989: 27) is simply a myth. Postmodern thought raises questions about\nthe existence of an underlying subject with essential properties\naccessible through introspection. The whole idea of the authentic as\nthat which is \u201coriginal\u201d, \u201cessential\u201d,\n\u201cproper\u201d, and so forth now seems doubtful. If we are\nself-constituting beings who make ourselves up from one moment to the\nnext, it appears that the term \u201cauthenticity\u201d can refer\nonly to whatever feels right at some particular moment.\n\nYet others have based their criticism of authenticity especially on\nthe emergence of a pervasive \u201cculture of authenticity\u201d.\nCultural critics have argued that the ostensible \u201cdecline\u201d\nof modern society might not primarily be a result of economical or\nstructural transformations, but as the outcome of an increasingly\nubiquitous ideal of authenticity. Before we turn to these critiques,\nit is helpful to understand how the ideal of authenticity became so\nwidespread. First, we should mention that Rousseau\u2019s work, made\na significant contribution to the popularization of authenticity.\nIndeed, some argue that authenticity can be seen as a\n\u201ckeystone\u201d in Rousseau\u2019s work, giving unity to his\nreflections on sociality, political order, and education (Ferrara\n2017: 2). Particularly The New Heloise (1997 [1761]) was\nenormously influential, with at least 70 editions in print before 1800\n(Darnton 1984: 242). This dispersion of the ideal of authenticity into\npopular culture was further strengthened by several factors. For\ninstance, a wide array of intellectuals of the nineteenth and the\nearly twentieth century had embraced the idea of authenticity, and\neven radicalized it by resisting established codes and publicly\ndefending alternative, \u201cartistic\u201d or\n\u201cbohemian\u201d modes of life.\n\nThe reception of the work of Sartre and Heidegger has surely\ncontributed to the popularization of the idea of authenticity, and the\ndecisive impact of this idea first began to manifest itself after the\nSecond World War (Taylor 2007: 475). Rossinow contends that the\npolitics of the 1960s were centered on questions of authenticity.\nFollowing his account, the main driving force towards political and\nsocial changes of the New Left movement in the 1960s was \u201ca\nsearch for authenticity in industrial American life\u201d (Rossinow\n1998: 345). Both J. Farrell (1997) and Rossinow argue that the New\nLeft emerged partly as a reaction to traditional American liberalism\nand Christian existentialism, replacing the negative concept of\n\u201csin\u201d with \u201calienation\u201d and the positive goal\nof \u201csalvation\u201d with that of \u201cauthenticity\u201d.\nConfronted with what they understood as alienation that\n\u201cisn\u2019t restricted to the poor\u201d (Rossinow 1998: 194),\nNew Left activism reached beyond civil rights to moral rights and\nattempted to bring about a recovery of a sense of personal wholeness\nand authenticity by curing the institutions of American society.\n\nThe emerging youth culture was characterized by a severe\ndissatisfaction with the \u201cmorass of conformity\u201d of the\nparental generation (Gray 1965: 57). The critique of the growing\nconformity of life got more persistent during the 1950s, and a number\nof social scientists in widely read books criticized what they saw as\nwidespread conformity and inauthenticity. Among these, The Lonely\nCrowd (1950) by Riesman and The Organization Man (1956)\nby Whyte received the most attention. Riesman points out that the\nefficacious functioning of modern organizations requires\nother-directed individuals who smoothly adjust to their environment.\nHowever, he also notes that such people compromised themselves, and a\nsociety consisting mostly of other-directed individuals faces\nsubstantial deficiencies in leadership and human potential.\n\nOn the background of this development, it seems that at a time when\nrelativism appears difficult to surmount, authenticity has become a\nlast measure of value and a common currency in contemporary cultural\nlife (Jay 2004). So, under the impact of existentialism on Western\nculture, the ubiquitous desire for authenticity has emerged in modern\nsociety as \u201cone of the most politically explosive of human\nimpulses,\u201d as Marshall Berman argues (1970: xix). \n3. Conceptions of Authenticity\n3.1 Kierkegaard and Heidegger\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s work on authenticity and his suggestion that each\nof us is to \u201cbecome what one is\u201d (1992 [1846]: 130), is\nbest seen as linked to his critical stance towards a certain social\nreality and a certain essentialist trend in philosophical and\nscientific thought. On the one hand, he (1962 [1846]) condemned\naspects of his contemporary social world, claiming that many people\nhave come to function as merely place-holders in a society that\nconstantly levels down possibilities to the lowest common denominator.\nIn more contemporary terms, we can say that Kierkegaard provides a\ncriticism of modern society as causing \u201cinauthenticity\u201d.\nLiving in a society characterized by such \u201cmassification\u201d\nlead to what he refers to as widespread \u201cdespair\u201d that\ncomes to the fore as spiritlessness, denial, and defiance. On the\nother hand, he rejected the view that a human being should be regarded\nas an object, as a substance with certain essential attributes. Rather\nthan being an item among others, Kierkegaard proposes to understand\nthe self in relational terms: \u201cThe self is a relation that\nrelates itself to itself\u2026\u201d (Kierkegaard 1980 [1849]:13).\nThis relation consists in the unfolding project of taking what we find\nourselves with as beings in the world and imparting some meaning or\nconcrete identity to our own life course. Thus, the self is defined by\nconcrete expressions through which one manifests oneself in\nthe world and thereby constitutes one\u2019s identity over time. In\nKierkegaard\u2019s view, \u201cbecoming what one is\u201d and\nevading despair and hollowness is not a matter of solitary\nintrospection, but rather a matter of passionate commitment to a\nrelation to something outside oneself that bestows one\u2019s life\nwith meaning. For Kierkegaard, as a religious thinker, this ultimate\ncommitment was his defining relation to God. The idea is that\npassionate care about something outside ourselves gives diachronic\ncoherence in our lives and provides the basis for the narrative unity\nof the self (Davenport 2012).\n\nThe most familiar conception of \u201cauthenticity\u201d comes to us\nmainly from Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time of 1927. The\nword we translate as \u2018authenticity\u2019 is actually a\nneologism invented by Heidegger, the word Eigentlichkeit,\nwhich comes from an ordinary term, eigentlich, meaning\n\u2018really\u2019 or \u2018truly\u2019, but is built on the stem\neigen, meaning \u2018own\u2019 or \u2018proper\u2019. So\nthe word might be more literally translated as\n\u2018ownedness\u2019, or \u2018being owned\u2019, or even\n\u2018being one\u2019s own\u2019, implying the idea of owning up to\nand owning what one is and does (for a stimulating recent\ninterpretation, see McManus 2019). Nevertheless, the word\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 has become closely associated with\nHeidegger as a result of early translations of Being and Time\ninto English, and was adopted by Sartre and Beauvoir as well as by\nexistentialist therapists and cultural theorists who followed\n them.[1]\n\nHeidegger\u2019s conception of ownedness as the most fully realized\nhuman form of life emerges from his view of what it is to be a human\nbeing. This conception of human Dasein echoes\nKierkegaard\u2019s description of a \u201cself\u201d. On\nHeidegger\u2019s account, Dasein is not a type of object among others\nin the totality of what is on hand in the universe. Instead, human\nbeing is a \u201crelation of being\u201d, a relation that\nobtains between what one is at any moment (the immediacy of the\nconcrete present as it has evolved) and what one can and will be as\nthe temporally extended unfolding or happening of life into\nan open realm of possibilities. To say that human being is a relation\nis to say that, in living out our lives, we always care about\nwho and what we are. Heidegger expresses this by saying that, for each\nof us, our being (what our lives will amount to overall) is always\nat issue. This \u201cbeing at stake\u201d or \u201cbeing\nin question for oneself\u201d is made concrete in the specific stands\nwe take\u2014that is, in the roles we enact\u2014over the course of\nour lives. It is because our being (our identity) is in question for\nus that we are always taking a stand on who we are. Since the German\nword for \u2018understanding\u2019, Verstehen, is\netymologically derived from the idea of \u2018taking a stand\u2019,\nHeidegger can call the projection into the future by which we shape\nour identity \u2018understanding\u2019. And because any stand one\ntakes is inescapably \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d, understanding\ncarries with it some degree of competence in coping with the world\naround us. An understanding of being in general is therefore built\ninto human agency.\n\nTo the extent that all our actions contribute to realizing an\noverarching project or set of projects, our active lives can be seen\nas embodying a life-project of some sort. On Heidegger\u2019s view,\nwe exist for the sake of ourselves: enacting roles and\nexpressing character traits contribute to realizing some image of what\nit is to be human in our own cases. Existence has a directedness or\npurposiveness that imparts a degree of connection to our life stories.\nFor the most part, having such a life-plan requires very little\nconscious formulation of goals or deliberation about means. It results\nfrom our competence in being members of a historical culture that we\nhave mastered to a great extent in growing up into a shared world.\nThis tacit \u201cpre-understanding\u201d makes possible our familiar\ndwelling with things and others in the familiar, everyday world.\n\nHeidegger holds that all possibilities of concrete understanding and\naction are made possible by a background of shared practices opened up\nby the social context in which we find ourselves, by what he calls the\n\u2018They\u2019 (das Man). Far from it being the case that\nsocial existence is something alien to and opposed to our humanity,\nHeidegger holds that we are always essentially and inescapably social\nbeings. As he says,\n\n\nThey itself prescribes that way of interpreting the world that lies\nclosest. Dasein is for the sake of the They in an everyday\nmanner\u2026 In terms of the They, and as the They, I am\n\u2018given\u2019 proximally to \u2018myself\u2019\u2026. (1962\n[1927]: 167, translation modified)\n\n\nTo be a teacher, for instance, I must adopt (and perhaps blend) some\nset of the ready-made styles of classroom presentation and of dealing\nwith students laid out in advance by existing norms and conventions of\nprofessional conduct.\n\nTo say that we are always the They is not to say we are automata,\nhowever. Heidegger suggests that even in the bland conformism of\n\u201caverage everydayness\u201d we are constantly making choices\nthat reflect our understanding of who we are. Nevertheless, in average\neverydayness, we are as a rule adrift, acting as one of the\n\u201cherd\u201d or \u201ccrowd\u201d\u2014a form of life\nHeidegger calls \u201cfalling\u201d (Verfallen). Heidegger\n(1962 [1927]: 220) emphasizes that calling this way of living\n\u201cfalling\u201d does not imply that it is \u201ca bad or\ndeplorable ontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of\nhuman culture might be able to rid themselves\u201d (1962 [1927]:\n220). On the contrary, since there is no exit from the social\nworld\u2014since it is the \u201conly game in town\u201d\u2014it\nplays a positive role in creating the background of shared\nintelligibility that lets us be fully human in the first place.\nNevertheless, Heidegger is aware that there is something deeply\nproblematic about this falling mode of existence. In \u201cdoing what\none does\u201d, he suggests, we fail to own up to who we are. We do\nnot take over our own choices as our own and, as a result, we are not\nreally the authors of our own lives. To the extent that our lives are\nunowned or disowned, existence is inauthentic (uneigentlich),\nnot our own (eigen).\n\nOur condition as They-selves is one of dispersal, distraction and\nforgetfulness. But this \u201cdownward plunge\u201d captures only\none aspect of Dasein, Heidegger says. In order to be able to realize\nthe capacity for authenticity, one must undergo a personal\ntransformation, one that tears us away from falling. This is possible\nonly given certain fundamental insights arising in a life. The first\nmajor shift can occur when one experiences an intense bout of anxiety.\nIn anxiety, the familiar world that seemed to assure one\u2019s\nsecurity suddenly breaks down, and in this world-collapse one finds\nthat the significance of things is \u201ccompletely lacking\u201d\n(1962 [1927]: 186). One finds oneself alone, with no worldly supports\nfor one\u2019s existence. In anxiety, Dasein encounters itself as an\nindividual, ultimately alone. In Heidegger\u2019s words,\n\u201cAnxiety individualizes Dasein and thus discloses it as\n\u2018solus ipse\u2019\u201d (1962 [1927]: 188). The\nsecond transformative event is the encounter with one\u2019s\n\u201cownmost\u201d possibility, the possibility of death as the\npossible loss of all possibilities. In facing our own finitude, we\nfind that we are always future-directed happenings or projects, where\nwhat is crucial to that ongoing forward movement is not its\nactualization of possibilities, but the \u201cHow\u201d with which\none undertakes one\u2019s life. Heidegger tries to envision a way of\nlife he calls anticipatory running-forward\n(Vorlaufen) as a life that clear-sightedly and intensely\ncarries out its projects, no matter what they may be. The third\ntransformative event is hearing the call of conscience. What\nconscience calls out to us is the fact that we are\n\u201cguilty\u201d in the German sense of that word, which means\nthat we have a debt (Schuld) and are responsible for\nourselves. Conscience tells us that we are falling short of what we\ncan be, and that we are obliged to take up the task of living with\nresoluteness and full engagement. Such resoluteness is seen clearly in\nthe case of vocational commitments, where one has heard a calling and\nfeels pulled toward pursuing that\n calling.[2]\n\nThe three \u201cexistentialia\u201d that structure Dasein\u2019s\nBeing-in-the-world make up the \u201cformal existential totality of\nDasein\u2019s structural whole\u201d, what Heidegger calls\ncare. To be Dasein, an entity must have some sense of what it\nis \u201ccoming toward\u201d (Zu-kunft, the German for\n\u201cfuture\u201d), what has \u201ccome before\u201d (what is\n\u201cpassed\u201d, Vorbei), and what one is dealing with\nin one\u2019s current situation (\u201cmaking present\u201d). The\ndefining characteristics of Dasein\u2019s potentiality-for-Being are\ndisplayed in the transformative events that lead to the possibility of\nbeing authentic (eigentlich, as we saw, from the stem meaning\n\u201cproper\u201d or \u201cown\u201d). When Dasein confronts and\ngrasps its authentic possibility of being, it becomes possible to see\nthe whole of Dasein, including both its being as a They-self\nand as authentic being-one\u2019s-self. \u201cDasein is\nauthentically itself in [its] primordial\nindividualization\u201d, where the \u201cconstancy\n[St\u00e4ndigkeit] of the Self \u2026 gets\nclarified\u201d (1962 [1927]: 322). What defines the wholeness and\nunity of Dasein is determined not by an underlying substance (e.g.,\nthe sub-ject, that which underlies), but by the \u201csteadiness and\nsteadfastness\u201d (best\u00e4ndigen Standfestigkeit, ibid)\nof authenticity.\n\nThe key to understanding authenticity lies, as we have seen, in the\ncharacterization of Dasein\u2019s being as a relation\nbetween two aspects or dimensions making up human existence. On the\none hand, we find ourselves thrown into a world and a\nsituation not of our own making, already disposed by moods and\nparticular commitments, with a past behind us that constrains our\nchoices. With respect to this dimension of human life, we are\ngenerally absorbed in practical affairs, taking care of business,\nstriving to get things done as they crop up from time to time. This\n\u201cbeing-in-a-situation\u201d naturally inclines us to everyday\nfalling as Heidegger describes it.\n\nAt the same time, however, to be human is to be underway toward\nachieving ends that are understood as integral to one\u2019s\noverarching life-project. My actions at any moment, though typically\naimed at accomplishing tasks laid out by the demands of circumstances,\nare also cumulatively creating me as a person of a particular sort. In\nthis sense, my futural projection as \u201cunderstanding\u201d has\nthe structure of being a projection onto one\u2019s ownmost\npossibility of being. So, for example, when I attend a boring\nparent/teacher conference, I do so as part of handling my current\nduties. But this act is also part of being a parent insofar\nas it contributes to determining \u201cthat for the sake of\nwhich\u201d I understand myself as existing. Given this distinction\nbetween current means/ends strategic actions and long-range\nlife-defining undertakings, it is possible to see that there are two\nsenses of freedom in play in Heidegger\u2019s account of human\nexistence. There is freedom in the humdrum sense of doing what I\nchoose to do under ordinary conditions, a freedom Heidegger presumably\ninterprets in an agent-libertarian way. But there is also freedom in\nan ethically more robust sense. In addition to choosing courses of\naction among options, Dasein is capable of \u201cchoosing to choose a\nkind of being-one\u2019s-self\u201d (1962 [1927]: 314) through its\nongoing constitution of that identity for the sake of which it exists.\nThus, I attend the parent/teacher conference and behave in a\nparticular way because I care about being a parent and a citizen of a\nparticular sort. I understand this stance as having repercussions for\nmy life as a whole, and I grasp the need for resoluteness in\nholding steady to undertakings of this sort if I am to shape my\nidentity in the way I can care about. For Heidegger, the resolute\ncommitment that is made concrete and defined in one\u2019s day-to-day\nactions is what imparts steadiness and steadfastness\nto a life. It is also the condition for being responsible for\none\u2019s own existence: \u201cOnly so can [one] be\nresponsible [verantwortlich]\u201d, Heidegger says (1962\n[1927]: 334, translation modified). Authenticity, defined as standing\nup for and standing behind what one does\u2014as owning and\nowning up to one\u2019s deeds as an agent in the\nworld\u2014becomes possible in this sort of resolute commitment to\nthe \u201cfor the sake of which\u201d of one\u2019s existence.\n\nIt should be obvious that this conception of authenticity has very\nlittle to do with the older idea of being true to one\u2019s own\npregiven feelings and desires. But there is still a clear respect in\nwhich the idea of \u201cbeing true to oneself\u201d has a role to\nplay here. What distinguishes this conception from the conceptions of\npop psychology and romantic views of authenticity is the fact that the\n\u201ctrue self\u201d to which we are to be true is not some\npre-given set of substantive feelings, opinions and desires to be\nconsulted through inward-turning or introspection. On the contrary,\nthe \u201ctrue self\u201d alluded to here is an on-going narrative\nconstruction: the composition of one\u2019s own autobiography through\none\u2019s concrete ways of acting over the course of a life as a\nwhole. Feelings and desires are, of course, profoundly important, as\nare the features of one\u2019s situation and one\u2019s concrete\nconnections to others. Heidegger wants to recover a firm sense of the\nwholeness of the existing individual. But this wholeness is found in\nthe connectedness of what Heidegger calls the \u201chappening\u201d\nor \u201cmovement\u201d of a life\u2014that is, in the unfolding\nand constantly \u201cin-progress\u201d storyizing that continues\nuntil death. What is at stake in the ideal of authenticity is not\nbeing true to some antecedently given nature, then, but being\na person of a particular sort. Heidegger emphasizes that being\nauthentic presupposes that one instantiate such virtues as\nperseverance, integrity, clear-sightedness, flexibility, openness, and\nso forth. It should be obvious that such a life is not necessarily\nopposed to an ethical and socially engaged existence. On the contrary,\nauthenticity seems to be regarded as a \u201cexecutive virtue\u201d\nthat provides the condition for the possibility of being a moral agent\nin any meaningful sense whatsoever.\n\nOthers argue that Heidegger uses authenticity in both\nevaluative-normative and purely descriptive senses. In the descriptive\nuse of the term, inauthenticity is simply the default condition of\neveryday life, in which our self-relations are mediated by others. In\nthis sense, authenticity involves no judgment about which mode of\nbeing is superior for Dasein. But sometimes Heidegger\u2019s language\nturns normative (Carman 2003), and the seemingly neutral inauthentic\nform of relating transforms into something negative. Inauthentic\nDasein is now \u201cnot itself\u201d, loses itself\n(Selbstverlorenheit), and becomes self-alienated. At this point, it is\nargued that when introducing the normative-evaluative sense, Heidegger\npresents three modes of life:\nauthentic\u2014average(ness)\u2014inauthentic, where the authentic\nand inauthentic modes are existential modifications of average\neverydayness (Blattner 2006: 130; Dreyfus 1991). In this picture, an\nauthentic way of life is owned, an inauthentic disowned, and the\nmiddle one\u2014which is how we live much of the time\u2014is simply\none that is unowned. Dasein and authenticity emerge in contrast to\nthis background and out of this background, so that the primordially\nindifferent mode is the condition of possibility for authenticity or\ninauthenticity. In addition, Carman (2003: 295) argues that\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of conscience can help us further illustrate\nhis account of authenticity and shows how the \u201ccall of\nconscience\u201d may be interpreted as expressive responsiveness to\none\u2019s own particularity.\n3.2 Sartre and de Beauvoir\n\nPublished in 1943, Sartre\u2019s opus magnum, Being and\nNothingness: A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology, had a\nsignificant influence on philosophical thought and intellectual life\nin the second half of the twentieth century. His principal goal in\nthis book is to \u201crepudiate the spirit of\nseriousness\u201d of traditional philosophy as well as of\nbourgeois culture (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 796). The spirit of\nseriousness assumes (1) that there are transcendent values that exist\nantecedently to humans, and (2) that the value of a thing is part of\nthe actual being of the valued thing. Sartre\u2019s view, in\ncontrast, is that all values are generated by human interactions in\nsituations, so that value is a human construct with no extra-human\nexistence in things.\n\nTo address the question of human existence, Sartre scrutinizes our\neveryday lives, focusing on two particular aspects. He notes that\nhuman beings, like other entities in the world, have certain concrete\ncharacteristics that make up what he calls their\n\u201cfacticity\u201d or what they are \u201cin themselves\u201d\n(en soi). Facticity makes up the element of\n\u201cgivenness\u201d we must work with: I find myself with a past,\na body and a social situation that constrains me in what I can do.\nThis \u201cjust being there\u201d is above all contingent: there is\nno prior justification or reason for the existence of my being. On\nSartre\u2019s view, the \u201cin itself\u201d does not even have\nany determinate characteristics, since every determination (every\n\u201cthis, not that\u201d) is first introduced into the\ntotality of being by our specific interpretations of things.\n\nWhile human beings share their \u201cfacticity\u201d with other\nentities in the world, they are unique among the totality of entities\ninsofar as they are capable of distancing themselves from what is\n\u201cin itself\u201d through reflection and self-awareness. Rather\nthan being an item in the world with relatively fixed attributes, what\nis distinctive about me as a human being is that I am capable of\nputting my own being in question by asking myself, for example,\nwhether I want to be a person of a particular sort. This capacity for\ngaining distance inserts a \u201cnot\u201d or a\n\u201cnonbeing\u201d into the totality of what is, which allows me\nto organize what surrounds me into a meaningfully differentiated\nwhole. In addition, human consciousness is the source of the\n\u201cnot\u201d because it is itself a \u201cnothingness\u201d. In\nother words, a human being is not just an \u201cin itself\u201d but\nalso a \u201cfor itself (pour soi), thus characterized by\nwhat Sartre calls \u201ctranscendence\u201d. As transcendence, I am\nalways more than I am as facticity because, as surpassing my brute\nbeing, I stand before an open range of possibilities for\nself-definition in the future.\n\nSartre\u2019s notion of transcendence is closely linked with the idea\nof freedom. Humans are free in the sense that they have the\nability to choose how they are going to interpret things, and in these\ninterpretations they are deciding how things are to count or matter.\nWe constitute the world through our freedom to the extent that our\nways of taking things determine how reality will be sorted out and\nmatter to us. At the same time, we constitute ourselves\nthrough our own choices: though the facticity of my situation creates\nsome constraints on my possible self-interpretations, it is always up\nto me to decide the meaning of those constraints, and this means that\nwhat I take to be limitations are in fact produced by my own\ninterpretations or meaning-giving activities. Such limitations are\ngrasped in light of antecedent commitments, on the background of which\nsituations becomes intelligible, as affording certain actions and/or\nmodes of evaluation. It is our antecedent commitments that shape our\nworld, making situations and objects intelligible as threatening or\nfavorable, easy or full of obstacles, or more generally, as affording\ncertain actions (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 489). Our engagements provide a\nhermeneutic structure within which our situations and motives become\ncomprehensible and reveal themselves in the way situations appear to\nus\u2014as significant, requiring our attention, etc. (1992a [1943]:\n485).\n\nIt is important to note that Sartre\u2019s notion of freedom is\nradical. Freedom is absolute to the extent that each person decides\nthe significance of the constraints in his or her facticity: \u201cI\nfind an absolute responsibility for the fact that my facticity\n\u2026 is directly inapprehensible\u201d, because supposed\n\u201cfacts\u201d about me are never brute facts, \u201cbut always\nappear across a projective reconstruction of my for-itself\u201d\n(Sartre 1992a [1943]: 710). For Sartre, only our choices and their\nprojected ends define our situations as meaningful, as threatening or\nfavorable, as affording certain actions etc. The resistances and\nobstacles that one encounters in a situation acquire meaning only in\nand through the free choice. Thus, individuals are responsible not\nonly for their identities, but for the way the world presents itself\nin their experiences. Even others are just\n\u201copportunities and chances\u201d for my free\ncreative activity. According to this early formulation, it is up to us\nto interpret how other people are to matter to us relative to\nsituations in which we find ourselves engaged (Sartre 1992a [1943]:\n711).\n\nBut human beings are not merely characterized by facticity and\ntranscendence; they are also seen as embodying a deep and\nirreconcilable tension between facticity and transcendence. This\ntension comes to the fore in Sartre\u2019s account of \u201cbad\nfaith\u201d. Bad faith, a kind of self-deception, involves believing\nor taking oneself to be an X while all along one is (and knows\noneself to be) actually a Y. The most familiar form of bad\nfaith is acting as if one were a mere thing\u2014solely\nfacticity\u2014and thereby denying one\u2019s own freedom to make\noneself into something very different. Thus, the person who thinks she\nis a coward \u201cjust as a matter of fact\u201d is excluding from\nview the ability to transform her existence through changed ways of\nbehaving. Such bad faith is a denial of transcendence or freedom.\n\nAt first, it might seem that one could escape bad faith by making a\nsincere, deep commitment to something and abiding by that\ncommitment\u2014for example, a total, resolute engagement of the self\ncomparable to Kierkegaard\u2019s notion of an \u201cinfinite\npassion\u201d. In this regard, Sartre considers a person who tries to\nwholeheartedly believe that his friend really likes him. \u201cI\nbelieve it\u201d, he says, \u201cI decide to believe in it\nand maintain myself in this decision\u2026\u201d (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 114). My belief will be steady and solid, like something\n\u201cin itself\u201d that informs my being and cuts through all the\ntenuousness and unsteadiness of my subjective life. I know I\nbelieve it, I will say. If I could make myself believe\nsomething in this way, then to achieve this might be what we could\ncall \u201cgood faith:\u201d to actually be something,\nwithout the questionability of the \u201cnot\u201d creeping in.\nHowever, Sartre doubts that such an absolute, being-determining\ncommitment is possible. In fact, Sartre claims that any such sort of\n\u201cgood faith\u201d would actually amount to little more than\nanother form of self-deception. For if my decision to believe is in\nfact a decision, it must always be something that to some extent\ndistances me from what is decided. That is why we use the word\n\u2018believe\u2019 to imply some degree of uncertainty, as when we\nsay, \u201cIs he my friend? Well, I believe he is\u201d.\nLucid self-awareness shows us that in making a choice, we can never\nattain the condition of the \u201cin itself\u201d, because what we\nare is always in question for us. This is what Sartre means when he\nsays human being is always \u201cpreviously corrupted\u201d and that\n\u201cbad faith [always] reapprehends good faith\u201d (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 116). Thus, the project of being in good faith seems\nimpossible, as we are always necessarily in bad faith.\n\nThe inescapable nature of bad faith seems to leave no room for the\npossibility of authenticity. This might be why the word translated as\n\u201cauthentic\u201d only appears twice in this vast tome. On one\noccasion, Sartre attacks Heidegger for introducing the idea of\nauthenticity as a way of providing something foundational in an\notherwise totally contingent world. The concept of authenticity\n\u201cshows all too clearly [Heidegger\u2019s] anxiety to establish\nan ontological foundation for an Ethics\u2026\u201d (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 128). A second and more obscure appearance of the word comes\nat the end of the discussion of bad faith early in the book. Here\nSartre acknowledges that his account of bad faith seems to have the\nconsequence that there can be no such thing as good faith, so that\n\u201cit is indifferent whether one is in good faith or in bad\nfaith\u201d, and that in turn seems to imply that \u201cwe can never\nradically escape bad faith\u201d. Nevertheless, he goes on, there may\nbe a \u201cself-recovery of being which has been previously\ncorrupted\u201d, a recovery \u201cwe shall call authenticity, the\ndescription of which has no place here\u201d (Sartre 1992a [1943]:\n116n).\n\nOne might thus conclude that there is no way to be true to what one\nis, because there is nothing that one is. However, such a negative\nconclusion would be reached only by someone who embraced from the\noutset the \u201cspirit of seriousness\u201d Sartre sets out to\nattack. Seriousness would lead us to think that there is simply a fact\nof the matter about a person: the person is either a believer or he is\nnot. But, as Linda A. Bell (1989: 45) has noted, there is another\npossibility. If one rejects the spirit of seriousness, one might\nlucidly acknowledge that, as transcendence, one\u2019s\nbelief is always in question and so not really a secure belief. Yet,\nat the same time, one might also recognize that, as\nfacticity, one genuinely holds a belief, and that the belief is\ncentral to one\u2019s being as an engaged agent in this situation. In\nSartre\u2019s convoluted style of formulation, \u201che would be\nright if he recognized himself as a being that is what it is not and\nis not what it is\u201d (Bell 1989: 45). On this account, I believe,\nbut I also acknowledge my ability to retract the belief, since nothing\nis ever fixed in stone.\n\nWhat is suggested here is that a correlate of authenticity can be\nfound in the idea of being true to the inescapable tension at the core\nof the human self. This would be attained if one clear-sightedly\nacknowledged the fundamental ambiguity of the human\ncondition. Authenticity would then be what Sartre calls a\n\u201cself-recovery of being which was previously corrupted\u201d\n(1992a [1943]: 116). In a sense, humans can never really be\nanything in the way brute objects can be things with determinate\nattributes. In Bell\u2019s words, authenticity would be \u201cthe\nawareness and acceptance of\u2014this basic ambiguity\u201d (1989:\n46). This conclusion is supported by Sartre\u2019s later work,\nAnti-Semite and Jew where he writes,\n\n\nAuthenticity, it is almost needless to say, consists in having a true\nand lucid consciousness of the situation, in assuming the\nresponsibilities and risks it involves, in accepting it \u2026\nsometimes in horror and hate. (1948: 90)\n\n\nLucid recognition of the ambiguity of the human condition is the\nleading idea behind Beauvoir\u2019s The Ethics of Ambiguity.\nBeauvoir takes over Sartre\u2019s characterization of the human\ncondition and expands on ideas only hinted at in Sartre\u2019s famous\nlecture, \u201cThe Humanism of Existentialism\u201d (1946), in\ndeveloping a conception of authenticity. According to Beauvoir,\nSartre\u2019s conception of the human being as \u201cengaged\nfreedom\u201d implies not just that each individual finds his or her\n\u201creason for being\u201d in concrete realizations of freedom,\nbut that willing one\u2019s own freedom necessarily involves willing\nthe freedom of all humans. In achieving one\u2019s own freedom, she\nwrites, freedom must also will \u201can open future, by seeking to\nextend itself by means of the freedom of others\u201d (1948: 60). The\npoint here is that a dedication to freedom, when clearly grasped in\nits full implications, will be seen to call for a future in which an\nunrestricted range of possibilities is open to all.\n\nBeauvoir also builds on Sartre\u2019s notion of engagement\nto extend the idea of authenticity. Following Sartre, we are always\nalready engaged in the affairs of the world, whether we realize it or\nnot. To be human is to be already caught up in the midst of social and\nconcrete situations that call for commitments of certain sorts on our\npart. Sartre takes this ground-level fact of engagement as the basis\nfor exhorting us to be engaged in a deeper sense, where this implies\nthat we decisively and wholeheartedly involve ourselves in what the\ncurrent situation demands. Of course, once we have abandoned the\nspirit of seriousness, we will recognize that there are no\nantecedently given principles or values that dictate the proper course\nfor our existential engagement, so that any commitment will be tenuous\nand groundless. But the authentic individual will be the one who takes\nup the terrifying freedom of being the ultimate source of values,\nembraces it, and acts with a clarity and firmness suitable to his or\nher best understanding of what is right in this context. In this way,\nthe conception of authenticity is continuous with the ideal of being\ntrue to ourselves: we are called upon to become, in our concrete\nlives, what we already are in the ontological structure of our\nbeing.\n\nThis is in agreement with the manner in which Sartre describes the\nconsequences of acting against one\u2019s deepest commitments.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that I could have done otherwise, but that is not\nthe problem. It ought to be formulated like this: could I have done\notherwise without perceptibly modifying the organic totality of the\nprojects that make up who I am?\n\n\nSartre goes on to say that the character of the act may be such\nthat\n\n\ninstead of remaining a purely local and accidental modification of my\nbehavior, it could be effected only by means of a radical\ntransformation of my being-in-the-world\u2026 In other words: I\ncould have acted otherwise. Agreed. But at what price? (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 454)\n\n\nThus, acting otherwise or, more precisely, failing to act on\none\u2019s fundamental commitments, comes at the price of\ntransforming who one is. This change effectively precludes one from\ncarrying on with an unchanged self-conception.\n4. Recent Accounts of Authenticity\n\nIn the last three decades, authors like Taylor (1989, 1991, 1995,\n2007), Ferrara (1993; 1998), Jacob Golomb (1995), Guignon (2004, 2008)\nand Varga (2011a) have attempted to reconstruct authenticity by\nmaintaining that the justified criticism of self-indulgent forms of\nthe idea does not justify the total condemnation of the idea itself\n(see Taylor 1991: 56). Instead of abandoning the notion of\nauthenticity, they attempt to reconstruct it in a manner that leads\nneither to aestheticism nor to atomistic self-indulgence.\n\nIn The Ethics of Authenticity, and the more fully articulated\nSources of the Self, Taylor makes a case for retaining the\nconcept of authenticity (and the practices associated with it) on the\ngrounds that the original and undistorted idea of authenticity\ncontains an important element of self-transcendence (Taylor 1991: 15;\nAnderson 1995). Unsatisfied with the widespread criticism of\nauthenticity as an adequate ethical orientation, Taylor sets out to\nprove that authenticity does not necessarily lead to aestheticism or\nself-indulgence: the justified criticism of self-indulgent forms of\nthe ideal does not justify the complete condemnation of the ideal\nitself (Taylor 1991: 56). This would mean extricating aestheticism,\nsubjectivism, individualism, and self-indulgent interpretations of\nthis ideal from what Taylor (Ibid.: 15) holds to be an original\nunderstanding of that concept as achieving self-transcendence\n(Anderson 1995). Restoring an undistorted version, Taylor says, could\nguard against meaninglessness, which is one of the \u201cmalaises of\nmodernity\u201d that Taylor regards as tied to trivialized forms of\nthe culture of authenticity. Self-transcendence, which once was a\ncrucial element in the ideal of authenticity, is practically lost from\nthe contemporary version, giving rise to cultures of self-absorption,\nwhich ultimately deteriorate into the malaise of absurdity.\n\nAlready in Sources of the Self, Taylor draws attention to how\nmodernism gives birth to a new kind of inward turn that not only\nattempts to overcome the mechanistic conception of the self linked to\ndisengaged reason but also the Romantic ideal of a faultless alignment\nof inner nature and reason. Instead, for the modernists, a turn inward\ndid not mean a turn towards a self that needs articulation.\n\n\nOn the contrary, the turn inward may take us beyond the self as\nusually understood, to a fragmentation of experience which calls our\nordinary notions of identity into question. (Taylor 1989: 462)\n\n\nWhile in modernism, the turn inward still contained a\nself-transcending moment, the critical point where the ideal of\nauthenticity becomes flattened is when it becomes\n\u2018contaminated\u2019 by a certain form of\n\u2018self-determining freedom\u2019 that also contains elements of\ninwardness and unconventionality (Taylor 1991: 38). Self-determining\nfreedom\n\n\nis the idea that I am free when I decide for myself what concerns me,\nrather than being shaped by external influences. It is a standard of\nfreedom that obviously goes beyond what has been called negative\nliberty (being free to do what I want without interference by others)\nbecause that is compatible with one\u2019s being shaped and\ninfluenced by society and its laws of conformity. Instead,\nself-determining freedom demands that one break free of all such\nexternal impositions and decide for oneself alone. (Taylor 1991:\n27)\n\n\nNot only is self-determining freedom not a necessary part of\nauthenticity, it is also counterproductive because its\nself-centeredness flattens the meanings of lives and fragments\nidentities. For Taylor, the process of articulating an identity\ninvolves adopting a relationship to the good or to what is important,\nwhich is connected to one\u2019s membership in a language community\n(Taylor 1989: 34\u201335). As he clearly states, \u201cauthenticity\nis not the enemy of demands that emanate from beyond the self; it\npresupposes such demands\u201d (Taylor 1991: 41). It cannot be up to\nme to decide what is important, since this would be self-defeating.\nInstead, whatever is important for me must connect to an\ninter-subjective notion of the good, wherefrom a good part of its\nnormative force lastly emanates. In this sense, authenticity simply\nrequires maintaining bonds to collective questions of worth that point\nbeyond one\u2019s own preferences. Taylor wants to show that modes of\ncontemporary culture that opt for self-fulfillment without regard\n\n\n(a) to the demands of our ties with others, or (b) to demands of any\nkind emanating from something more or other than human desires or\naspirations are self-defeating, that they destroy the conditions for\nrealizing authenticity itself. (Taylor 1991: 35)\n\n\nThus, not only do we need the recognition of concrete others in order\nto form our identities, but we must also (critically) engage with a\ncommon vocabulary of shared value orientations. In other words, Taylor\npoints out that authenticity needs the appropriation of values that\nmake up our collective horizons.\n\nIn his Reflective Authenticity, Alessandro Ferrara also sets\nout to defend authenticity as an ideal, but in contrast to Taylor he\nis interested in the social and philosophical issues of the relation\nbetween authenticity and validity. According to Ferrara\u2019s\ndiagnosis, we are currently witnessing a profound transition that,\nbesides affecting cultures, values and norms, also touch on the\n\u201cfoundations of validity,\u201d thereby affecting the\n\u201cbedrock of the symbolic network through which we relate to\nreality and reproduce our life-forms\u201d (Ferrara 1998: 1). At the\ncore of this transformation is the reformulation of\n\u201cwell-being\u201d (eudaimonia) as the normative ideal\nof authenticity, which can be of help in reconstructing a contemporary\nunderstanding of normativity. For Ferrara, it can ground a new ideal\nof universal validity \u201cultimately linked with the model of\nexemplary uniqueness or enlightening singularity thus far associated\nwith \u2018aesthetics\u2019\u201d (Ferrara 1998: 10). Authenticity\nis then characterized by the \u201cself-congruency\u201d of an\nindividual, collective or symbolic identity (Ferrara 1998: 70), and is\nthought of as providing a new universal validity that does not build\non the generalizable but rather on the exemplary. Ferrara views\nSimmel\u2019s idea of an individual law as an instructive example of\nsuch an anti-generalizing universalism, and it is exactly this\ncharacteristic that makes it better suited to the pluralist contexts\nfaced by modern Western societies. More recently, Ferrara (2019) has\nargued that authenticity currently faces a \u201cdual paradox\u201d\nand is misconstrued by many critics advocating its deconstructionist\ndismissal.\n\nGolomb (1995) provides an informative historical overview of the\ngenesis and development of the concept of authenticity, paying\nattention to both literary and philosophical sources. While\ncontinuously reminding us of the inherently social dimension of\nauthenticity, one of the achievements here is the focus on boundary\nsituations where authenticity \u201cis best forged and\nrevealed\u201d (Ibid.: 201). Golomb takes a neutral position on the\nethical value of authenticity, maintaining that \u201cthere is no\nreason to suppose that it is any better or any more valuable to be\nauthentic than to act inauthentically\u201d (Ibid.: 202).\n\nGuignon (2004) explores both the philosophical roots of authenticity\nand its contemporary manifestations in popular culture. He\nthoughtfully criticizes pop-psychological literature that deals with\nthe authentic life by making recourse to the subdued \u2018inner\nchild\u2019. Since Rousseau, the dichotomy between authentic and\ninauthentic has often been interpreted akin to the distinction between\nchild and adult (Guignon 2004: 43). Like the inner child, the\nauthentic self is depicted as not yet corrupted by the pressures,\ncompetitiveness, and conformity of modern public life. Guignon draws\non the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Jung to remind us of less\nromanticized visions of the inner child. Additionally, Guignon (2004:\n151) aims to identify the manner in which authenticity can be\nunderstood as being at the same time a personal and a\n\u201cfundamentally and irreducibly\u201d social virtue.\nAuthenticity then involves reflectively discerning what is really\nworth pursuing in the social context in which the agent is situated\n(Ibid.: 155). If the ideal of authenticity is possible only in a free\nsociety with a solid foundation of established social virtues, it\nwould seem that trying to be authentic, if it is to be coherent, must\ninvolve a commitment to sustaining and nurturing the type of society\nin which such an ideal is possible. A reflection on the social\nembodiment of virtues therefore suggests that authenticity, like many\nother character ideals, carries with it an obligation to contribute to\nthe maintenance and well-being of a particular type of social\norganization and way of life (Guignon 2008: 288; 2004: 161). On the\nother hand, Guignon (2004, 2008) argues that in a democratic society,\nin which the authority of government\u2014in setting the political\ncourse\u2014stems from the consent of the governed, there is good\nreason to promote virtues like authenticity that sustain such an\norganization of government. To be authentic is to be clear about\none\u2019s own most basic feelings, desires and convictions, and to\nopenly express one\u2019s stance in the public arena. But that\ncapacity is precisely the character trait that is needed in order to\nbe an effective member of a democratic society (Guignon 2008:\n288).\n\nVarga (2011a) shares the fundamental assumption that authenticity has\na certain potential (and therefore deserves to be reformulated), but\nhe also thinks that it could be used for a critical inquiry into the\npractices of the self in contemporary life. By way of an analysis of\nself-help and self-management literature, Varga detects a\n\u201cparadoxical transformation:\u201d the ideal of authenticity\nthat once provided an antidote to hierarchical institutions and\nrequirements of capitalism, now seems to function both as an\ninstitutionalized demand towards subjects to match the systemic\ndemands of contemporary capitalism and as a factor in the economic\nutilization of subjective capacities. Varga argues that it is in\n\u201cexistential\u201d choices that we express who we are, and that\nthese have a complex phenomenology characterized by a sense of\nnecessity. In such choices, described as \u201calternativeless\nchoices\u201d, we articulate who we are, bringing into reality some\ntacit intuitions that often only take on a gestalt-like formation. In\nthese cases, we both discover who we are \u201con the inside\u201d,\nand actively constitute ourselves. Varga\u2019s examination of the\nstructure of our commitments culminates in the claim that the internal\nstructure of our commitments commits us to more than what we happen to\ncare about. In many cases it may actually commit us to publicly\nintelligible values that we take our commitments to embody\u2014an\naspect that may constrain the manner of our practical deliberation and\nthe way in which we can pursue our commitments (Varga 2011a,b).\n\nAlong similar lines, Bauer (2017) defends authenticity as an ethical\nideal, arguing that the ideal should understood as the combination of\nthe ideal of expressing one\u2019s individual personality and the\nideal of being an autonomous and morally responsible person. Others\nhave argued that authenticity might require more than living in accord\nwith commitments that one wholeheartedly endorses. For example, Rings\n(2017) highlights an epistemic criterion. The point is that the\ncommitments in question have to be chosen in light of an\nacknowledgment of facts concerning one\u2019s personal history and\npresent context. Thus, self-knowledge might matter more than hitherto\nrecognized, even if the self-relation most pertinent to authenticity\nis not primarily of an epistemic nature. \n",
