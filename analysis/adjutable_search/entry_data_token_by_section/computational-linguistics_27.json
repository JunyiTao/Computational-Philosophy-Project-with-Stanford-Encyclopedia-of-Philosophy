    "main_text": "Applications || Machine translation (again)\n10.1 Machine translation (again)\nOne of the oldest MT systems is SYSTRAN,\nwhich was developed as a rule-based system beginning in the 1960s, and\nhas been extensively used by US and European government agencies, and\nalso in Yahoo! Babel Fish and (until 2007) in Google Translate. \nIn 2010, it was hybridized with statistical MT techniques. As mentioned, Google\nTranslate currently uses phrase-based MT, with English serving as an\ninterlingua for the majority of language pairs. Microsoft's Bing\nTranslator employs dependency structure analysis together with\nstatistical MT. Other very comprehensive translation systems include\nAsia Online and WorldLingo. Many systems for small language groups\nexist as well, for instance for translating between Punjabi and Hindi\n(the Direct MT system), or between a few European languages (e.g.,\nOpenLogos, IdiomaX, and GramTrans).\nTranslations remain error-prone, but their quality is usually\nsufficient for readers to grasp the general drift of the source\ncontents. No more than that may be required in many cases, such as\ninternational web browsing (an application scarcely anticipated in\ndecades of MT research). Also, MT applications on hand-held devices,\ndesigned to aid international travellers, can be sufficiently accurate\nfor limited purposes such as asking directions or emergency help,\ninteracting with transportation personnel, or making purchases or\nreservations,  When high-quality translations are required,\nautomatic methods can be used as an aid to human translators, but\nsubtle issues may still absorb a large portion of a translator's time.\n",
