    "main_text": "Augustine || The City of God\n4.1 The City of God\n\nThe work of Augustine\u2019s most likely to be known to modern\nstudents of political thought is The City of God. Although\nthis work was often copied in the middle ages (382 manuscripts have\n survived),[10]\n a reading of the whole work was never part of the university\ncurriculum. Extracts from it were included in influential anthologies,\nsuch as Gratian\u2019s Decretum and Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences (c.\n 1150).[11]\n\n\nTwo cities, the city of God and the earthly city, are distinguished by\ntwo loves, love of God and (misdirected) love of self, and by two\ndestinies, heaven and hell. Augustine\u2019s most famous contribution\nto theology was the doctrine of predestination, a position that only\nbecame pronounced later in life. God has decreed from all eternity\nthat to some he will give the grace (special help) needed to attain\neternal salvation, while the rest of mankind (the majority) will go to\neternal damnation\u2014the massa damnata (City of\nGod, XXI.12, p. 1070). Salvation requires the grace of\n\u201cfinal perseverance\u201d, i.e., the grace of being in\nfriendship with God at the moment of death. Some who live well for\nmost of their lives may fall away at the very end. Thus we cannot tell\nfor sure who is predestined to salvation. Since the city of God\nconsists of those predestined to salvation, we cannot be sure of its\nmembership. The city of God is not identical with the Church, since\nnot all members of the Church will be saved. The earthly city is not\nidentical with any particular state, since some members of a state may\nbe predestined to salvation. A particular state may include citizens\nof both cities.\n\nAlthough the members of the two cities have different ultimate values,\nthey may have intermediate ends in common\u2014for example, they all\ndesire peace on earth. Insofar as any particular state serves such\ncommon ends it will have the cooperation of members of the city of God\n(City of God, XIX.17, p. 945\u20137). As a Platonist\nAugustine thought in terms of a hierarchy of levels of reality, in\nwhich lower levels imitate or reflect the higher levels.\nAugustine\u2019s is not a philosophy of \u201cblack and\nwhite\u201d, of stark opposition between the forces of light and the\nforces of darkness\u2014this was the Manichean philosophy, to which\nAugustine at one time subscribed, until the reading of certain works\nof the Platonists had led him to reject it. According to Augustine\nthere is no absolute evil (see City of God XI.22, XII.2, 3,\n7;\n Confessions VII.xii.18\u2013xiii.19;\n Enchiridion 11\u201312). Anything evil must be to some extent good, or it could\nnot exist at all. Its evil consists in disorder or misdirection, in\nits failing to attain all the goodness appropriate to it. \n\n\nThe peace of all things lies in the tranquillity of order, and order\nis the disposition of equal and unequal things in such a way as to\ngive to each its proper place. (City of God, XIX.13, p. 938)\n\n\n\nThere are many orderings and sub-orderings, and there are therefore\ndifferent kinds or levels of peace, and (for beings capable of moral\nchoice) different kinds or levels of virtue, justice and\n happiness.[12]\n\n\nTrue virtue presupposes obedience to the true God. But something like\ntrue virtue, namely love of honour, may lead to something like justice\nand peace, as it did in the Roman Republic (City of God,\nV.12). Earlier, Augustine had offered to prove that by Cicero\u2019s\ndefinition, the Romans never had a republic: \u201cI shall attempt to\nshow that no such commonwealth ever existed, because true justice was\nnever present in it\u201d (City of God II.21, p. 80; see\nalso the entry on\n ancient political philosophy\n (\u00a76. Cicero and the Roman Republic), since the Romans did not\nobey the true God (cf. XIX.21). But this is only an argumentum ad\nhominem. As Augustine says, \u201cThere was, of course,\naccording to a more practicable definition, a commonwealth of a\nsort\u201d (II.21, p. 80). It is only by an unduly narrow definition\nthat it can be said that non-Christians cannot form a commonwealth.\nMotivated by love of honour, the Romans were able to live together in\nan approximation to peace, justice and happiness, though not in\n\u201ctrue\u201d peace, justice and happiness. Justice in some\nmeasure is essential to anything that deserves to be called a\ncommonwealth. \n\n\nJustice removed, then, what are kingdoms but great bands of\nrobbers?\u2026 It was a pertinent and true answer which was made to\nAlexander the Great by a pirate whom he had seized. When the king\nasked him what he meant by infesting the sea, the pirate defiantly\nreplied: \u201cThe same as you do when you infest the whole world;\nbut because I do it with a little ship I am called a robber, and\nbecause you do it with a great fleet, you are an emperor\u201d.\n(City of God, IV.4, p. 147\u20138)\n\n\nSome medieval writers, whom some modern historians have called\n\u201cPolitical\n Augustinians\u201d,[13]\n inferred from Augustine\u2019s discussion of Cicero\u2019s\ndefinition of a republic that among non-Christians there can be no\ncommunity. According to\n Giles of Rome\n (d. 1316), among others, non-Christians can have no property rights\nand no political rights, since such things presuppose membership of a\ncommunity, and only Christians can form a true community. But the\nviews of these so-called Political Augustinians were generally\nrejected by other medieval political thinkers.\n\nWe should not infer that Augustine believed only good Christians can\nbe rulers. Nevertheless, he believes that Christian virtue, if\nobserved, makes for better government (City of God, V.24, p.\n232).\n\nAmong medieval Christians there were at least three views of the goods\nand evils of government:\n\n\n\nGovernment may be, and should be, rule by the ideal Christian ruler,\nwhom Protestants later called \u201cthe godly prince\u201d; such a\nruler would lead his people in obedience to God.\n\n\nGovernment may be simply a wicked tyranny, an expression of the\n\u201cearthly city\u201d. As Pope Gregory VII (1081) once wrote:\n\n\n\nWho does not know that kings and dukes had their rulership from those\nwho, not knowing God, strove from blind greed and intolerable\npresumption to dominate their equals, namely mankind, by pride,\nrapine, perfidy, murder, and crimes of all sorts, urged on by the\nruler of the world, i.e., the devil? (Gregory VII 1081: 552; see also\nPoole 1920: 201, fn. 5)\n\n\n\nGovernment exists to organise the cooperation of \u201cmen of good\nwill\u201d (to use a modern phrase), i.e., citizens of the two cities\nunited by an interest in earthly peace and other earthly goods valued\nby both Christians and others. Such a limited view of the goals of\ngovernment is found in Marsilius and Ockham (McGrade 1974:\n109\u201333).\n\n\nAll three views could find support in The City of God.\n",
