    "main_text": "Issues || Bodiless vs. Bulky Boundaries\n1.4 Bodiless vs. Bulky Boundaries\n\nA fourth source of concern relates to the intuition, implicit in\nAristotle\u2019s and Euclid\u2019s definitions, that boundaries are\nlower-dimensional entities, i.e., have at least one dimension fewer\nthan the entities they bound. The surface of a (continuous) sphere,\nfor example, is two-dimensional (it has no \u201csubstance\u201d or\n\u201cdivisible bulk\u201d), the Mason-Dixon Line is one-dimensional\n(it has \u201clength\u201d but no \u201cbreadth\u201d), and a\nboundary point such as the vertex of a cone is zero-dimensional (it\nextends in no direction). This intuition has become common currency in\ncontemporary philosophy through Johnson (1922: 168; 1924:\n163\u2013164) and is germane to much of what we ordinarily say about\nboundaries. Yet it is problematic insofar as it contrasts with several\nindependent intuitions that are of a piece with both common sense and\nphilosophical theorizing. For instance, there is a standing tradition\nin epistemology (from Moore 1925 to Jackson 1977 and Gibson 1979)\naccording to which boundaries play a crucial role in perception: we\nsee (opaque) physical objects indirectly by seeing their surfaces. Yet\nit is not clear how one could see a whole just by seeing part of it\n(Chisholm 1957; Clarke 1965), even less how one could literally\nsee parts that lack physical bulk altogether (Stroll 1986a,\n1986b). Likewise, we often speak of surfaces as of things that may be\npitted, or damp, or that can be scratched, polished, sanded, and so\non, and it is unclear whether such predicates can be applied at all to\nimmaterial entities. In such cases, it would rather seem that surfaces\n(and boundaries more generally; see Jackendoff 1991) are to be\nconstrued as \u201cthin layers\u201d that are schematized\nas having fewer dimensions than the wholes to which they apply. The\nsame sort of schematization is commonplace in the geopolitical domain,\nwhere the boundary lines that we find depicted in ordinary maps and\natlases may in fact correspond to border \u201cbelts\u201d, or\n\u201czones\u201d, of various kinds and widths (Prescott 1965). The\nvery fact that the geographic notion of a natural boundary is often\nillustrated with reference to rivers, ravines, mountain ranges, etc.\nis indicative of this tendency. As Ratzel famously put it: \u201cThe\nborder area is the reality, the border line the abstraction\nthereof\u201d (1897: 448).\n\nArguably, this conceptual tension between boundaries understood as\nlower-dimensional entities and boundaries understood as thin layers,\nor zones, reflects an irreducible ambiguity in ordinary speech (Stroll\n1977, 1979). And, arguably, it is only the first conception that gives\nrise to the puzzles outlined in the foregoing sections; bulky\nboundaries and border zones can be treated as ordinary, extended\nproper parts of the bodies and regions they bound. Yet a general\ntheory of boundaries should have something to say about the second\nconception as well \u2014 and more generally about the interaction\nbetween the mathematical idealization associated with the former\nconception and the physical, cognitive, and philosophical significance\nof the latter (Stroll 1988; Simons 1991; Galton 2007).\n\nThe issue also relates to the question of whether there can be\nextended mereological simples. The ancient atomists had no doubts,\nwith Democritus famously holding that the ultimate constituent of\nreality, while indivisible, come in an infinite variety\n\u201cdiffering in size and in shape\u201d (Aristotle,\nMetaphysics, III, 203b2). Today it is more common to assume\nthat the mereological structure of a thing always matches perfectly\nthat of its spatio-temporal receptacle (what Varzi 2007 calls\n\u201cmirroring\u201d and Uzquiano 2011 \u201charmony\u201d),\nwhich would imply the opposite answer. Nevertheless, in recent years\nseveral authors have rejected the assumption, seriously reviving the\nhypothesis of mereological simples that occupy extended regions of\nspace and/or time (see e.g. Markosian 1998, Parsons 2000, Simons 2004,\nBraddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, and McDaniel 2007 along with the\nentry on\n location and mereology).\n Insofar as the lower-dimensional nature of boundaries may be\nconstrued in terms of their being indivisible along one or\nmore dimensions, as opposed to unextended along those\ndimensions (a conception encouraged also by some medieval\nphilosophers, e.g. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t of Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101, II, ii, 4\u20136), such a view would suggest\nthat also a boundary\u2019s spatio-temporal extension may transcend\nits mereological structure; the boundary would lack divisible bulk,\nbut it might nonetheless possess divisible extent. A boundary point,\nfor instance, would be pointy in that it has no proper parts, though\nit could extend over a (small) one-dimensional, a two-dimensional, or\neven a three-dimensional region. Again, such extended boundaries would\nbe refreshingly unproblematic. As with their divisible bulky cousins,\none could easily explain how we can see them, for instance, or polish\nthem, scratch them, etc. However, they would also raise questions of\ntheir own. Above all: How would such boundaries connect to the things\nthey bound? Would there be a further, unextended boundary separating\nthe two (and matching the unextended boundary between the\ncorresponding receptacles)? In the case of boundaries with divisible\nbulk, the answer to the latter question is obviously in the\naffirmative. It is an open question, however, whether the same answer\nshould apply to extended indivisible boundaries.\n",
