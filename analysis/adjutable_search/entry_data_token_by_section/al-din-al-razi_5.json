    "main_text": "Psychology\n6. Ethics\n\nOne passage which makes that point is found in his Book on the\nSoul and Spirit (Kit\u0101b al-Nafs wa-l-r\u016b\u1e25\n86\u20137): humans differ so much in their character traits that one\nmay suspect they do not all share the same essence. That exemplifies\nthe approach of this separate treatise, which is to stage a joint\ninquiry into ethics and the soul. One theme addressed here is the\nimprovement of our \u201ccharacter traits\n(akhl\u0101q)\u201d. This is hardly surprising: the\ncentrality of this concept in Arabic moral thinking was such that\nethics itself was referred to as \u02bfilm al-akhl\u0101q\n(literally, \u201cthe science of character traits\u201d). And\nphilosophers both before Fakhr al-D\u012bn, like Miskawayh (d.1040)\nand Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u02bfAd\u012b (d.974), and after him, like\nNa\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (d.1274), put\ncharacter traits in both the thematic focus of their writings on\nethics and the titles of those writings. These works are part of a\nbroadly Aristotelian tradition of virtue ethics, which encourages\nreaders to pursue excellent rather than base character. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 also contributed to this tradition, as in two short\nworks called On Ethics (again, F\u012b l-\u02bfilm\nal-akh\u0101q) and On Governance (F\u012b\nl-Siy\u0101sa; for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019S influence on later\npractical philosophy see Kaya 2014).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn was of course aware of this approach to ethics, and\ntook an interest in the topic of virtue (al-Shaar 2012). But he was no\nAristotelian. Historically, we can say that he responds more to\nkal\u0101m ethics; philosophically, we can say that he was a\nconsequentialist rather than a virtue theorist (for this the essential\nreading is Shihadeh 2006; see also his 2016). Taking the historical\npoint first, as an Ash\u02bfarite he is committed to what would now be\ncalled a \u201cdivine command theory\u201d. That is, the right\naction is whatever is commanded by God, the wrong action is whatever\nis forbidden. The Ash\u02bfarite stance emerged as a critique of the\nMu\u02bftazilite position, which holds that certain types of action\nare known to be wrong without recourse to revelation, for example\nlying. We can always imagine circumstances in which\n\u201cintrinsically wrong\u201d action types turn out to be right\nafter all, like lying to a tyrant to avoid betraying a prophet\n(Arba\u02bf\u012bn vol.1, 348). Therefore this\nMu\u02bftazilite theory is untenable.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s early works uphold a straightforward divine\ncommand theory. But he comes to pair this with a hedonist and\nconsequentialist ethics, which assumes that pleasure is good for\nhumans and pain bad. To avoid a regress of normative explanation,\nthere must be some fundamental norm, and in Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\nview hedonism provides that norm. The connection between hedonism and\nAsh\u02bfarite ethics is that God has promised us pleasure if we\nfollow His commands, and pain if we do not. Thus, the divine command\ntheory turns out to be justified on egoistic, consequentialist grounds\n(Shihadeh 2016: 66). This also opens the prospect for determining what\nwe should do in the absence of a divine command: whatever is\n\u201cbeneficial\u201d, in other words pleasure-maximizing for the\nagent. Because pleasure is now so central to his ethical theory, he\ndevotes significant attention to its nature, refuting the originally\nPlatonic \u201crestoration theory\u201d according to which all\npleasure is a return to a natural state from a harmful or painful\nstate (Shar\u1e25 vol.2, 552\u20134). This analysis might\napply to the base pleasures of food or sex, but would not hold for\nhigher pleasures like the grasping of knowledge (see his Epistle\nCensuring the Pleasures of this World, in Shihadeh 2016).\n\nIf we again take his late work, the Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, as\nour best evidence for Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s final philosophical\nviews, then we can infer that he retained his commitment to\nconsequentialism. Characteristically, he itemizes arguments against\nhis own position and refutes them one by one\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.3, 66\u20139). For example, you\nmight encounter an ill person in a wasteland where no one else is\naround to see, and help them. What pleasure are you getting out of\nthis? None, it would seem, yet you would and should do it nonetheless.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn explains that you would be acting on the principle\nthat, if you were in the same position as the unfortunate person, you\nwould want to be treated in the same way. This is not an appeal to\nsome kind of Kantian categorical imperative, but more like what we now\ncall \u201crule utilitarianism\u201d. That is, we should act in such\na way that if people in general acted like this, pleasure would be\nmaximized and pain minimized (for a similar interpretation see\nShihadeh 2016: 80, who emphasizes that the motivation is\n\u201cneither altruistic nor based on a sense of duty\u2026 but is\na self-centred, prudential motivation\u201d).\n\nThis example shows that Fakhr al-D\u012bn was not simply reacting to\nAvicennan falsafa by rehearsing an Ash\u02bfarite\nkal\u0101m view (though he does also refute Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proposal, inspired by Neoplatonism, that evils\nare cases of non-being). He also applied his philosophical acuity to\nreflect on, and modify, the Ash\u02bfarite position. In the later\ntradition he was sometimes accused of adopting skepticism. A\nrepresentative anecdote has him weeping after being disabused of\nsomething he had formerly taken as certain truth and lamenting,\n\u201cwhat is there to prove that all my beliefs are not of this\nnature?\u201d (quoted at Kholeif 1966: 18). The impression of\nskepticism could also be encouraged by his tendency to provide only a\nminimal verdict, or no verdict at all, at the end of a lengthy\ndialectical investigation of some issue. This is something else that\nannoyed later readers: the sheer accumulation of arguments he offered\nfor unacceptable views was dangerous, even if refutations of these\narguments were given thereafter. And it does seem that he saw certain\ndemonstration as being impossible on many theological and\nphilosophical issues. But he was not a global skeptic. As discussed\nabove, he had views about what it would mean to have knowledge, and\nassumed that knowledge is indeed attainable. His massive and still\ninadequately explored corpus testifies to his determination to attain\nthat knowledge like no one else in his time, and thus to supplant Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 as the indispensable thinker of the Islamic world.\n",
