    "main_text": "Religious Experience\n5. Religious Experience\n\nScheler\u2019s work on the phenomenology of religious experience is\none of his most significant contributions to the phenomenological\ntradition. Contrary to his contemporaries such as Husserl and\nHeidegger who persist on bracketing out the question of God or the\nholy, Scheler examines the experience in a direct and explicit manner.\nScheler\u2019s insistence on the possibility of a phenomenology of\nreligious experience, an insistence that it is possible to provide a\ndescription of the essential qualities and conditions of the\nexperience of the holy, is itself a critique of modernity and of the\npositivistic tendencies growing in philosophical and scientific\nthought.\n\nAccording to Scheler, the modern worldview harbors a prejudice with\nrespect to what counts as an experience or what is evidential. For the\nmodern thinker, only those experiences that can be proven in a\nrational or logical manner are true or evidential experiences (GW V,\n104). The prejudice is not that matters of faith or religious\nexperience are not meaningful, but that they are not subject to\nrigorous scientific or critical investigation. Because they lie\noutside the bounds of reason, we are, as Wittgenstein would say, to\nremain silent. For Scheler, the problem in modernity is that only one\ntype or form of evidence is regarded as objective or true, the mode of\nrational proof. Inherent to the practice of phenomenology is the\nopenness to distinctive modes of evidence. Any presupposition about\nwhat counts as objective or subjective, as true or merely\npsychological must be held in abeyance. For Scheler, the experience of\nthe holy or of the absolute is not given through rational proof, but\nin the distinctive evidential mode of revelation (GW V, 150). All\nrational proofs already assume the experience or the revelation of God\nand thus come too late in the attempt to grasp how the holy or the\nabsolute is experienced (GW V, 249). Scheler\u2019s approach is to\ngrant revelation its own integrity and to treat it as a meaningful\nexperience subject to philosophical investigation.\n\nIt is important to note at the outset of a discussion of\nScheler\u2019s work on religious experience that he prefaces his\nmajor work on religious experience, Vom Ewigen des Menschens\n(On the Eternal in Man), with a description of the religious\nand existential crisis that humanity faced at the end of World War I.\nMany, including Scheler, had hoped that the Great War would reawaken a\nsense of dignity both in one\u2019s culture and in humanity in\ngeneral. The war failed miserably in this respect and has left\nhumanity only \u201cdrunk\u201d with suffering, death and tears (GW\nV, 103). In this moment of despair comes the call to a religious\nrenewal, a call that concerns the very meaning and purpose of human\nexistence. For Scheler, World War I was the first collective\nexperience of humanity as such, i.e., an experience shared by all (GW\nV, 104). Consequently, the call to renewal, the desperate seeking of\nthe meaning of existence, is a call experienced by all of humanity. It\nhas thus never been so crucial to understand the meaning of revelation\nand the experience of the absolute, for the danger of the rise of an\nidol or a false god has never been so imminent. Whoever or whatever\nmay step in to answer this call to renewal during these times of\ncrisis potentially has the power to determine the meaning and course\nof humanity.\n\nA phenomenology of religious experience is, for Scheler, a description\nof the essential characteristics and the meaning of revelation.\nScheler defines revelation simply as the specific type of givenness\nwherein the divine or the holy is given (GW V, 249).\n\u201cGivenness\u201d is a term used by Scheler and other\nphenomenologists to name that which is experienced in a particular\nact. It is, more precisely, the objective correlate of the intentional\nact. There is the intending on the part of the person and that which\nis given, the object or meaning. To suggest that revelation is a\npeculiar mode of givenness is to say that the divine or the holy is\ngiven to the person in a unique manner that is wholly distinct from\nperceived objects or rational judgments. The attempt to describe the\nessential characteristics of revelation, characteristics that show how\nrevelation is distinct from other modes of givenness, assumes that\nrevelation has its own particular sense of lawfulness (GW V, 242).\nThis means that the investigation into the nature of revelation must\nfollow the logic demonstrated in the revelatory experience itself and\non its own accord.\n\nScheler distinguishes three essential characteristics of the act of\nrevelation that are unique to the religious act.\n\n\n\nThe intention of the religious act is world transcendence. Scheler is\ncommitted to the idea that the religious act is an intentional act.\nThe intention is the so-called subject correlate of the act of\nintentionality. In the case of revelation, this intention is a\ntranscendence of anything finite (i.e.of this world) (GW V, 245). This\nis not to say that revelation is not of this world or does not take\nplace in this world, nor does it mean that the holy is not experienced\nin a finite object such as a religious icon or a finite person.\nRather, it means that what is posited in the act of revelation is\nalways other than this world, a meaning transcending the finite or the\nrelative.\n\n\nThe objective correlate of the religious intention is also infinite in\nits meaning and value. Only the divine or the holy fulfills the\nintention of the religious act. No finite thing of any kind, no finite\ngood or object of love can fulfill the religious act. This is not to\nsay that we are not at times mistaken and erringly take a finite\nobject as infinite, as in the case of idolatry. What is sought in the\nreligious act is precisely that which in principle could not be\nexperienced in this world. We are seeking a happiness that would never\nbe possible on earth and we are hoping in the religious act for that\nwhich is impossible and unimaginable (GW V, 246).\n\n\nFinally, the religious act is only fulfilled through a reception\n(Aufnahme) of the divine that reveals itself to another\nbeing. (GW V, 245). In revelation, something is given, i.e.,\nexperienced. Scheler rejects the idea that the experience of the\ndivine is wholly immanent and could be explained through an\nobjectivization of an immanent experience, an experience motivated by\nand in the person. For this reason, the religious act is not\nsubjective. It is a response to that which is given, a response to the\ndivine that gives itself. The essential difference between so-called\nnatural religion (where the world is given as God\u2019s creation)\nand positive religion (where the experience of the divine is personal)\nlies in the way that the divine reveals itself. The revelation found\nin natural religion is generic: God is given in nature for all to see.\nRevelation in positive religion is the experience of a wholly unique\nrelation. God gives him or herself to me in a manner that is\nparticular to me (GW V, 249).\n\n\nIt is this third and final aspect of the religious act that marks\nScheler\u2019s contribution to the investigation of revelation.\nScheler\u2019s claim is that for there to be a religious act, the\ndivine must be given in experience. The question that immediately\narises, particularly within the context of the modern worldview, is\nhow we know that this experience is real and not imaginary or merely\nsubjective. Scheler agrees that there is no way to prove deductively\nor rationally that this experience was indeed real or that the divine\nexists. The givenness of the divine is its demonstration. Scheler uses\nthe German term Aufweis to distinguish the particular way in\nwhich the reality or truth of the experience is given in revelation.\nAn Aufweis is a pointing out or a showing of. The divine\nshows itself in such a manner that its existence cannot be proven by\nthe use of reason. In the experience of the divine, the existence of\nthe divine is given. For this reason, it is impossible to prove to\nanyone who has not had a religious experience that God or a god\nexists.\n\nAs with much of his research, Scheler\u2019s investigation into the\nreligious act is ultimately rooted in a a study of the meaning of the\nhuman being. For Scheler, the religious act is a fundamental and\nessential aspect of being human (GW V, 261). Each and every human\nbeing executes the intending of the absolute or the divine and is\nalways a response to the givenness of the absolute. A human being is a\nGod-seeker. This is not to say that everyone believes that there is a\nGod, but only that each and every one of us executes the religious\nintention, an intending of the absolute.\n\nAtheism is not a disproof of Scheler\u2019s claim; it is only a\nrejection of God\u2019s existence. That there is a negation of the\ndivine in atheism only demonstrates that even the atheist executes the\nreligious act. The negation of the divine only makes sense in the\ncontext of the religious act. For the atheist, one may very well\nintend the divine, but such intentions are only met with great\ndisappointment. The agnostic, on the other hand, holds open the\npossibility that the divine exists. For Scheler, the agnostic is a\nmetaphysical nihilist, a person who rejects that we could ever know\nwith certainty that there is a God.\n\nScheler\u2019s claim that the human being is a God seeker allows for\nthe beliefs of atheists and agnostics, but it leads him to a much\nstronger claim: \u201cEvery finite spirit believes either in a God or\nin an idol\u201d (GW V, 261). An idol is a finite object that is\ntreated as if it were infinite, as if it were God (GW V, 263). The\natheist is not really, according to Scheler, a non-believer. Rather,\nthe atheist believes in a no-God, that there is no absolute value or\nmeaning. This is still a religious act and a religious belief.\nScheler\u2019s point is that there is always an intending of the\nabsolute, a seeking of a God. What is in question is necessarily the\nobject intended as absolute. In the act of idolatry, this God is a\nfinite object or a good such as wealth, fame or power. The risk of\nidolatry is ever present, a risk entailed in the radical openness of\nthe human being to absolute value. Whether God exists or not is\nirrelevant here. What the investigation of the religious act and\nreligious experience demonstrates is that being human is an opening; a\nhuman being is open to the absolute and the divine.\n\nA final note and a useful transition into the next subject heading\nconcerns the relation between religions themselves and the question\nconcerning the diversity or variety of religious experience. The image\nScheler uses to depict the relation that different religions and\ncultures bear to one another is that of a tributary all flowing into\nthe same river toward the same end point (GW XIII, 92). Religious\nexperience yields only a glimpse of the holy and provides only a\npartial, but original insight. Although all religious insight yields\nsuch a partial glimpse, not all insights are of the same depth. Some\nof the deepest insights into the holy have formed and led to the major\nreligions of the world. These rivers may intersect, divide or share\ncertain pathways, but none serves or can serve as the disproof of the\nother. Religious faith and beliefs are of the most deeply rooted and\nsignificant, and consequently can often lead to great conflict with\nother faiths. In his more hopeful moments, Scheler thought that the\nincreasingly shrinking world promised the opportunity to understand\nthe different religious insights and form a greater understanding of\nthe divine. Yet, he also warned that these conflicts of faith may\ncontinue to lead to the bloodiest of wars. Acknowledging a genuine\nreligious diversity does not commit one to the view that all religious\nideas or beliefs are of the same value, but rather to the realization\nthat there are genuine and irreconcilable differences between them.\nHow we reconcile and live in a smaller world with these differences\nwill determine whether the future will be one of war or one of\npeace.\n",
