    "preamble": "\n\nAlain LeRoy Locke is heralded as the \u201cFather of the Harlem\nRenaissance\u201d for his publication in 1925 of The New\nNegro\u2014an anthology of poetry, essays, plays, music and\nportraiture by white and black artists. Locke is best known as a\ntheorist, critic, and interpreter of African-American literature and\nart. He was also a creative and systematic philosopher who developed\ntheories of value, pluralism and cultural relativism that informed and\nwere reinforced by his work on aesthetics. Locke saw black aesthetics\nquite differently than some of the leading Negro intellectuals of his\nday; most notably W. E. B. Du Bois, with whom he disagreed about the\nappropriate social function of Negro artistic pursuits. Du Bois\nthought it was a role and responsibility of the Negro artist to offer\na representation of the Negro and black experience which might help in\nthe quest for social uplift. Locke criticized this as\n\u201cpropaganda\u201d (AOP 12) and argued that the primary\nresponsibility and function of the artist is to express his own\nindividuality, and in doing that to communicate something of universal\nhuman appeal.\n\nLocke was a distinguished scholar and educator and during his lifetime\nan important philosopher of race and culture. Principal among his\ncontributions in these areas was the development of the notion of\n\u201cethnic race\u201d, Locke's conception of race as primarily a\nmatter of social and cultural, rather than biological, heredity. Locke\nwas in contemporary parlance a racial revisionist, and held the\nsomewhat controversial and paradoxical view that it was often in the\ninterests of groups to think and act as members of a\n\u201crace\u201d even while they consciously worked for the\ndestruction or alteration of pernicious racial categories. Racial\ndesignations were for Locke incomprehensible apart from an\nunderstanding of the specific cultural and historical contexts in\nwhich they grew up. A great deal of Locke's philosophical thinking and\nwriting in the areas of pluralism, relativism and democracy are aimed\nat offering a more lucid understanding of cultural or racial\ndifferences and prospects for more functional methods of navigating\ncontacts between different races and cultures.\n\nLocke, like Du Bois, is often affiliated with the pragmatist\nphilosophical tradition though somewhat surprisingly\u2014surprising\nbecause Locke's actual views are closer substantively to pragmatist\nthinkers Like Dewey, James, and Royce than are Du Bois's\u2014he does\nnot receive as much attention in the writings of contemporary\npragmatist philosophers as does Du Bois. Regardless, he is most\nstrongly identified with the pragmatist tradition, but his\n\u201ccritical pragmatism\u201d, and most specifically his value\ntheory, is also influenced by Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg, F.S.C. Schiller,\nAlexius Meinong, Frantz Brentano, and Christian von Erhenfels. From\nearly on in his education at Harvard University, Locke had an affinity\nfor the pragmatist tradition in philosophy. Locked developed his\nmature views on axiology well in advance of many leading\npragmatists\u2014e.g., Dewey and James. Among pragmatists, Locke has\narguably the most developed and systematic philosophy of value, and\noffers many critical insights concerning democracy.\n",

Chronology\n\n\n1885\u00a0\n Born Arthur Locke September 13 to Pliny Ishmael Locke and Mary\nHawkins Locke in Philadelphia, PA.\n\n1902\u00a0\n Graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia during that\nsame year Locke was afflicted by rheumatic fever, which did permanent\ndamage to his heart.\n\n1904\u00a0\n Graduates with Bachelor of Arts degree from Philadelphia School\nof Pedagogy first in his class. Publishes \u201cMoral Training in\nElementary Schools,\u201d his first known publication.\n\n1904\u201307\u00a0\n Locke attends Harvard University, earning his second Bachelor\nof Arts degree and graduating magna cum laude. During his\ntime at Harvard Locke was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society\nand studied under Josiah Royce, George Herbert Palmer, Hugo\nM\u00fcnsterberg, and Ralph Barton Perry. Though he was a member of\nthe faculty at the time Locke never actually studied with William\nJames. While at Harvard Locke received the Bowdoin Prize in English\nfor an essay composed on Tennyson entitled \u201cThe Prometheus Myth:\nA Study in Literary Tradition.\u201d It was while at Harvard that\nLocke first met Horace Kallen, who worked as an instructor.\n\n1907\u201309\u00a0\n In 1907 Locke was chosen as the first-ever African-American\nRhodes Scholar. Even though he held a right to admittance to an Oxford\ncollege as a Rhodes Scholar he encountered some difficulty in this\nregard until he was finally admitted to Hertford College. While at\nOxford Locke studied philosophy, Greek, and literature. It was while\nat Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar that Locke first met and became friends\nwith Pixley Ka Isasha Seme. In 1907 and 1908, Horace Kallen was also\nat Oxford as a Sheldon Scholar.\n\n1910\u201311\u00a0\n Following his studies at Oxford University and before returning\nto Harvard University to complete his PhD, Locke studied at the\nUniversity of Berlin under the German sociologist Georg Simmel, where\nhe was reacquainted with his Harvard professor Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg.\nWhile at the University of Berlin Locke deepened his interest in value\ntheory, particularly in the work of theorists such as Alexius Meinong,\nChristian Freiherr von Ehrenfels, and Frantz Brentano.\n\n1912\u201314\u00a0\n Appointed as assistant professor of English, philosophy, and\neducation to Teachers College at Howard University.\n\n1915\u00a0\n Gives a series of lectures to the Howard chapter of the NAACP\non the scientific study of race and race relations entitled\n\u201cRace Contacts and Interracial Relations: Lectures on the Theory\nand Practice of Race.\u201d\n\n1917\u00a0\n Doctoral dissertation entitled The Problem of\nClassification in Theory of Value submitted to adviser Ralph\nBarton Perry September 17, 1917.\n\n1918\u00a0\n Receives PhD in philosophy from Harvard University.\n\n1925\u00a0\n Fired from Howard University following efforts to achieve pay\nequity between black and white faculty. December of that year Locke\npublishes The New Negro: An Interpretation perhaps\nhis most famous work and earns himself recognition as a leading\nAfrican-American literary critic and aesthete.\n\n1928\u00a0\n Returns to Howard University following the appointment of\nMordecai W. Johnson, the university's first African-American\npresident.\n\n1935\u00a0\n Reportedly it was in this year that Locke renewed his interest\nin writing philosophy as signaled by the publication of \u201cValues\nand Imperatives,\u201d in American Philosophy, Today and\nTomorrow edited by Horace M. Kallen and Sidney Hook.\n\n1942\u00a0\n Publishes two edited volumes and an article: When Peoples\nMeet: A Study in Race and Culture edited with Bernhard J. Stern,\nColor: The Unfinished Business of Democracy special volume of\nSurvey Graphic and \u201cWho, and What, Is\nNegro?\u201d.\n\n1943\u00a0\n Delivers a series of lectures entitled \u201cThe Contribution\nof the Negro to the Culture of the Americas,\u201d under the auspices\nof the Haitian Ministry of Public Instruction as the Exchange\nProfessor for the Committee for Inter-American Artistic and\nIntellectual Relations.\n\n1953\u00a0\n Retired from Howard University and moved to New York.\n\n1954\u00a0\n Died June 9 in Mount Sinai Hospital, New York from persistent\nheart trouble.\n\n2. Axiology/Value Theory\n\nLocke's seminal essay in value theory, \u201cValues and\nImperatives\u201d is as ambitious in its aims as it is pioneering. In\nit Locke states what he takes to be the central problem for axiology;\ndetails the reasons for the failure of American philosophy,\nparticularly pragmatism, to make anything more than a minimal\ncontribution to the development of the philosophical study of values;\nargues that values are primarily rooted in human attitudes; and\nprovides an elaborate theoretical account of value formation and the\nfunctional role of values. A value, according to Locke, is \u201can\nemotionally mediated form of experience.\u201d Locke issues the\nfollowing warning: \n\n[i]n dethroning our absolutes, we must take care not to exile our\nimperatives, for after all, we live by them. We must realize more\nfully that values create these imperatives as well as the more\nformally super-imposed absolutes, and that norms guide our behavior as\nwell as guide our reasoning. (VI 34)\n\n\nValues are an important and necessary part of human experience. Values\nare an essential part of human existence as all human persons are\ninherently valuing beings. He writes:\n\n[t]he common man, in both his individual and group behavior,\nperpetuates the problem in a very practical way. He sets up personal\nand private and group norms as standards and principles, and rightly\nor wrongly hypothesizes them as universals for all conditions, all\ntimes and all men. (VI 35)\n\n\nValuations of multiple kinds pervade nearly every aspect of our lives;\nour aesthetic, moral and religious evaluations and judgments.\n\nOn Locke's estimation,\n\nthe gravest problem of contemporary philosophy is how to ground some\nnormative principle or criterion of objective validity for values\nwithout resort to dogmatism and absolutism on the intellectual plane,\nand without falling into their corollaries, on the plane of social\nbehavior and action, of intolerance and mass coercion. (VI 36)\n\n\nThis is the central and driving question of Locke's axiology and as\nsuch it points to some of the crucial aspects of his overall\nphilosophical view, but his theory of value specifically, and\nimportantly his social and political philosophy. On the axiological\nplane the question is reformulated as whether or not the fundamental\nvalue modes automatically or dispositionally set up their end values\nprior to evaluative judgment. If value modes automatically or\ndispositionally set up their own ends, then there would exist a more\ndirect approach to the apprehension of values. Moreover, if a\nconnection can be discovered between certain psychological states and\nparticular valuations then that might yield at least one avenue for an\nobjective assessment of values and valuations. On the social and\npolitical plane\u2014the practical plane where persons actually form\nvaluations and act on them in myriad ways\u2014the question is\nformulated in terms of how best to avoid a theory of value that is\nstatic, arbitrary and overly formulaic in ways that impede the\ntheory's ability to provide an adequate understanding of value\nphenomena. To do this, a functional analysis of value norms is\nrequired, and normative principles must be the result of the immediate\ncontext of valuation. This we will see in the following sections is\nthe major thrust of Locke's value pluralism and relativism. \n2.1 Value-Feelings and Value-Modes\n\nLocke begins by considering what he takes to be the most basic feature\nof values; their emotional character. He writes\n\nthe value-mode establishes for itself, directly through feeling, a\nqualitative category which, as discriminated by its appropriate\nfeeling-quality, constitutes an emotionally mediated form of\nexperience. (VI 38)\n\n\nThere is a particular feeling or feeling-quality associated with each\nvalue-mode. In fact, Locke contends that value-modes differ in virtue\nof differences in feeling-qualities. The value-mode, or perhaps\nbetter, the mode of valuing, refers to the qualitative character of a\nparticular way of experiencing as mediated by a given emotion or\nattitude which Locke terms the feeling-quality. This has several\nimportant implications for the general theory of value: predicating a\nvalue to a subject depends on the feeling-quality associated with it;\nvalues are immediately recognized through an apprehension of their\nemotional quality; value-predicates are determined by the affective\nand volitional influence of the feeling-quality; and the imperatives\nof a given value are given immediately once the primary\nfeeling-quality has been established.\n\nLocke claims that there is a necessary connection between the\nfeeling-quality and the value-mode with the former determining the\nlater. The value-mode is normally established as the value is being\napprehended. If this were not the case, the value-mode would be\nindeterminate even while its immediate quality is being felt. The\nbasic categories of value are not rational: one cannot simply reason\none's way to an understanding of them. In developing and articulating\nhis axiology, Locke looks for the categories of value in the actual\nvaluations of human beings. Rather than predetermining the categories\nof valuation and attempting to cram experiences of values into them,\nhis theory begins with our concrete valuations and determines which if\nany features they have in common. It is then on the basis of the\ncommonalities observed to obtain between particular experiences of\nvalues that they are classed together as members of the same class.\nLocke writes,\n\n[f]lesh and blood values may not be as universal or objective as\nlogical truth or schematized judgments, but they are not thereby\ndeprived of some relative objectivity and universality of their own.\nThe basic qualities of values\u2026pertain to psychological\ncategories. They are not grounded in types of realms of value, but are\nrooted in modes or kinds of valuing. (VI 38)\n\n\nLocke is aware that it is not easy to demonstrate that the fundamental\nidentity and unity of a value-mode depends on a feeling-quality. It\nmay be that the position thus far articulated is merely hypothetical\nand speculative and requires an experimental methodology to prove it.\nLocke notes that the main objections to the position have been\naddresses by developments in the Gestalt psychology insofar as it has\nestablished an empirical basis for a comprehensive perceptual scheme\nfunctioning in recognition, comparison and choice. Further\ncircumstantial evidence is offered for the position by the phenomenon\nof transvaluation (see\n section 2.3\n below).\n2.2 A Functional View of Values\n\nOn Locke's view, though the value-mode is determined immediately by\nthe affective character of the value, this is not the final\ndetermination of the value. Even after the value-mode has been\nascertained, the legitimacy of the value may still be in question, its\nplace in the overall value scheme may be unclear, and particular\naspects of the context of valuation may be uncertain. This leads Locke\nto conclude that the primary normative character of value norms is\nbest sought in their functional role as stereotypes of feeling\nattitudes and as habitual impulses toward certain choices of actions.\nThis would make them culturally specific, as well as temporally and\ngeographically contingent as values can only be habituated and\nfunction with any degree of reliability in specific contexts.\nMoreover, as in the case of apprehending value-modes, the\nfunctionality of a given value is to be discovered experientially;\nrather than, postulated a priori. Values, then, would only\nbecome absolutes\u2014should they become absolute at\nall\u2014because reason and judgment secondarily re-enforce them as\nsuch. In their immediate character and quality values are affective,\nbut they are further mediated by reason and judgment. Value\npredication depends on reason and judgment; but the predicates\nthemselves are determined by the modal quality of the value. So, the\njudgment that an object is beautiful or ugly involves reason and\njudgment, but that the object is experienced as aesthetic depends on\nits affective apprehension; its being experienced aesthetically. \n\nCommenting on his own preference for a functional theory of value\nLocke writes:\n\nI confess at the outset to a preference for a functional theory of\nvalue, but my brief for a functional analysis of value norms is not\ncompletely parti pris, but is made rather because a\nfunctional approach, even should it lead to a non-functionalist theory\nof value, of necessity treats the value varieties in terms of their\ninterrelationships, guaranteeing a comparative approach and a more\nrealistic type of value analysis. (FVVU 81)\n\n\nMoreover, a functional account of value has the theoretical advantages\nof being able to account for parallels between values, value\ninterchangeability, and transvaluation. It is perhaps in taking a\nfunctional view of values and their associated imperatives where\nLocke's theory of value is most pragmatic. A functional view of values\nemphasizes the fact that values are an essential feature of our\nlived-experiences. At its most basic level value functionality aims to\nprovide a way of understanding how particular values operate as\ncoordinating mechanisms for individual and collective action. Some\nvalues have a specific social role; a societal aim or goal that they\nhave been modified and adapted over time to help achieve or maintain.\nSuch values are often codified in the customs and traditions of a\nculture and can sometimes remain ritualized long after their\nfunctional role is obsolete. The importance and usefulness of a\nfunctional view of values in Locke's social and political philosophy\nis further explored in\n section 3.2\n below.\n2.3 Transvaluation\n\nTransvaluation is a central tenet of Locke's axiology. He writes:\n\n[t]he further we investigate, the more we discover that there is no\nfixity of content to values, and the more we are bound, then, to infer\nthat their identity as groups must rest on other elements. (VI 40)\n\n\nThe feeling-quality of a given value necessarily establishes the mode\nof valuation, i.e., the type of value in question (for example,\naesthetic, religious, moral etc.) as well as the appropriate\nvalue-predicates. However, there is no necessary connection between a\ngiven object that serves as the content of a value and any particular\nemotional response to that object. One and the same object may affect\nthe same person differently at different times, or may at the same\ntime elicit from multiple people different emotional reactions.\nTransvaluation, then is most simply valuing something in a different\nway, which requires, at first, having an atypical emotional\nassociation with the object of value. There are multifarious potential\ncauses of such transformations in one's affective responses to an\nobject, and those causes can be immediate or unfold over time.\n\u201cThe changed feeling-attitude creates a new value\u201d says\nLocke \u201cand the type-form of the attitude brings with it its\nappropriate value category. These modes co-assert their own relevant\nnorms; each sets up a categorical imperative of its own\u201d (VI\n41).\n\nLocke treats transvaluation as inevitable; values are dependent upon\nsocial and cultural forces that are always in a state of flux and\nsubject to myriad transformative influences at any given time, hence\nstatic values are implausible. Value transformation can take place on\nthe individual level or on the level of widespread social or cultural\nvalues. Locke's hope is that this analysis will bring us closer to a\npractical understanding of value and the mechanism of valuation, which\nhe hopes will bring us closer to understanding the grounds for both\nagreements among values and value conflict.\n2.4 Taxonomy of Values\n\nLocke offers a schematization of four traditional\nvalues\u2014religious, moral, logical and aesthetic\u2014to\ndemonstrate how his theory classifies values into types according to\ntheir characteristic feeling-quality (see the table below) (VI 43).\nThe schema also charts the value-predicates and the positive and\nnegative poles associated with each value-type (type of value).\nFinally, the schema further divides each value according to its\ndirectionality; that is, whether the value is primarily introverted,\nfunctioning inwardly on the individual subject, or is extroverted,\nfunctioning externally in a social context. \n\nLocke contends that his position has certain advantages over more\nlogical theories of value. In particular, it is better able to explain\ncertain value phenomena that are troubling for the latter type of\ntheories. Phenomena such as transvaluation, value merging, and value\nconflict are able to be explained in terms of the basic doctrine that\nthe mode of valuation is determined by the character of a subject's\naffective response in a value context. Locke claims that logical\ntheories of value have historically had difficulty accounting for\nphenomena such as the aesthetic appraisal of a logical or mathematical\nproof; moral commitment to aesthetic production; or aesthetic\nappreciation of religious practice. In particular, logical theories\nhave struggled to make sense of assigning predicates from one\nvalue-type to objects that are traditionally the content of a\ndifferent value-type as when a proof in logic is deemed beautiful or\nugly. Traditional theories treat such value predication as merely\nmetaphorical or analogical. \n\n\nModal\u00a0Quality\nValue\u00a0Type\nValue\u00a0Predicates\nValue\u00a0Polarity \n\n\n\n\n\nPositive\nNegative\n\nExaltation: (Awe\nWorship)\n\na.\nIntroverted: Inner Ecstasy\nReligious\nHoly\u2014Unholy\nHoliness\nSin\n\nb.\nExtroverted: Religious Zeal\n\nGood\u2014Evil\nSalvation\nDamnation\n\nTension: (Conflict\nChoice)\n\na.\nInner Tension of \u201cConscience\u201d\nEthical\nGood\u2014Bad\nConscience\nTemptation\n\nb.\nOuter Tension of Duty\nMoral\nRight\u2014Wrong\nRight\nCrime\n\nAcceptance or Agreement:\n(Curiosity\u2014Intellectual\nSatisfaction)\n\na.\nInner Agreement in Thought\nLogical Truth\nCorrect\u2014Incorrect\nConsistency\nContradiction\n\nb.\nOuter Agreement in Experience\nScientific Truth\nTrue\u2014False\nCertainty\nError\n\nRepose and Equilibrium\n\na.\nConsummation in Contemplation\nAesthetic\nBeautiful\u2014Ugly\nSatisfaction\nDisgust\n\nb.\nConsummation in Creativity\nArtistic\nFine\u2014Unsatisfactory\nJoy\nDistress \n\n\nLocke explains value conflict in terms of a more fundamental\npsychological incompatibility. Not only does the value-feeling\ndetermine the qualitative character of a given value, it also\nestablishes broader categories of value by grouping values according\nto their common affective quality. As he puts it \u201c[c]hange the\nattitude, and, irrespective of content, you change the value-type; the\nappropriate new predicates automatically follow\u201d (VI 44).\n\nValue attitudes can be psychologically incompatible, and where they\nare Locke contends that a hierarchical ranking of values will not\nresolve the incompatibility. In fact, he suggests that people resolve\nthe incommensurability of their various value attitudes by shifting\nfrom one mode of valuation to another. This is why a functional\naccount of values that determines the various value-modes on the basis\nof underlying psychological states is desirable. Such a theory is\nbetter able to achieve a reflective equilibrium with our actual value\npractices. All values have associated with them a set of imperatives.\nLocke does not have a great deal to say about how imperatives are\nformed. Presumably, imperatives are determined, at least in part, by\nthe qualitative character of the value in question. People begin by\nforming a value-attitude based on one's initial affective response to\nthe object of valuation. As a mediating form of experience a value\nsupplies motivational drives toward acting and refraining from acting\nin certain ways. Values provide normative direction not only for\ncognition and psychological drives, but also for action. Imperatives\nare partially in place as soon as the affective quality of the value\nis apprehended.\n3. Pluralism\n\nLocke's philosophical worldview is pervaded by a concern for\ndiversity. Locke takes pluralism in all its form\u2014religious,\ncultural, value etc.\u2014as a basic feature of the world. His\nprimary focus then becomes one of understanding the multiplicity of\nways in which peoples meet, and providing some normative guidance\nconcerning how best to act when they do. Values organize, coordinate,\nmediate and direct experience. In so doing, they serve both a valuable\nepistemic as well as existential function. Values direct and guide our\nactivity, but more than that they color the nature of our encounters\nwith other persons, and frequently function as a source of conflict\nbetween individual persons and groups of human beings. The common\nmistake among valuers that leads to a \u201ctotalizing\u201d of\nvalues as \u201cabsolutes\u201d or \u201cultimates\u201d is to\nforget that any given value encompasses only an aspect of reality and\nought not to be treated as transcendent or reducible to that reality.\nThis is a fundamental insight of Locke's philosophy of value as it is\napplied to social theory. And Locke believes that if he is correct in\nasserting that \u201c[a]s derivative aspects of the same basic\nreality, value orders cannot reasonably become competitive and rival\nrealities\u201d that he will have provided the necessary theoretical\nfoundation for a more latitudinarian exchange between diverse human\ncollectives (VI 47). Locke's presentation of his pluralist position\nproceeds as a response to three obstacles or barriers to pluralism:\nabsolutism, (counter) uniformitarianism, and arbitrary dogmatism. If\nindividual valuers or value groups are able to avoid these three\npitfalls, then either may possibly develop a pluralistic value\norientation.\n3.1 Three Barriers to Pluralism\n\nThe first barrier to pluralism is absolutism. Values and their\nassociated imperatives are absolute when they are thought to apply to\nall human beings, at all times irrespective of social or historical\nconditions. This is because absolutist conceptions of values are\nderived from, and ultimately justified by something other than the\nlived-experiences of human beings, be it God, or human rationality.\nWhereas pluralism is intended to accommodate a wide array of\ncontending values, absolutism countenances one, and only one set of\nvalues universally applicable to all human beings. Locke claims that\n\u201cabsolutism has come forward again in new and formidable\nguise,\u201d and he warns us to be on guard for \u201csocial and\npolitical forms of it, with their associated intellectual tyrannies of\nauthoritarian dogmatism and uniformitarian universality\u201d (PID\n53). These newer forms of absolutism, Locke claimed, are the products\nof older ones. When values are held to be absolute there often results\na tendency to discount the legitimacy of rival values. Pluralism\navoids conceiving of values in absolutist terms. Setting various value\nconceptions on equal footing is the aim of Locke's pluralism.\n\nUniformitarianism, the second obstacle to pluralism, is the view that\nvalues ought to be uniform within a given community or group. The\nexperiences of members of a given group are filtered through the same\nforms of mediation to produce value uniformity. Values are ascribed a\nsingle form for all members of a group; rather than allowing for a\nmultiplicity of mediated experiences. Value uniformity can be achieved\nviolently, coercively or peacefully, but in all instances it is an\nattempt to replace diversity with homogeneity. Locke suspects that it\nis the desire to defend one's own culture and to create consensus\namong competing value claims that is at the root of the quest for\nuniformity. Unfortunately, that motivation can easily lapse into an\nattempt to force one's own value system onto others without\njustification. Uniformitarianism is a refusal to accommodate the\nmyriad value forms that are essential to pluralism.\n\nFinally, Locke warns us to avoid the pitfalls of arbitrariness and\ndogmatism. Value commitments are arbitrary when one forms\nthem\u2014thereby rejecting viable alternatives\u2014in the absence\nof any justification for choosing them over other available options.\nOne holds her values dogmatically when she takes them to be\nindisputable and is closed-off to the possibility of taking a critical\nview of her value commitments that could possibly result in her\naltering or rejecting them.\n3.2 Pluralism as a Functional Base\n\nLocke describes pluralism as a functional base, one that can function\nas a foundation from which to achieve a rapprochement of conflicting\nvalues. Pluralism, as Locke envisions it, has the potential to create\nagreement among competing and conflicting values, through the\nrecognition of common features of various values and value systems. A\ncloser look at Locke's analysis of values; in particular, the three\nconcepts of basic human values, basic equivalence, and functional\nconstancy will illuminate what it means for pluralism to function in\nthis way.\n\nFirst, is the concept of basic human values, by which Locke means\nthose values that are common to many, or all value systems; values\nsuch as belief in god, commitment to one's cultural community, respect\nfor human life, etc. which though they may have multifarious\nmanifestations, are in a more general way common to most, if not all\ngroups. Of course, value communities differ, and no two value\ncommunities will be exactly alike, but there does exist substantial\noverlap of a subset of values across values communities. Basic human\nvalues then, are basic and human in virtue of their common expression\nin a plurality of value contexts and their pertaining to the lives of\nhuman beings, and not as a matter of their universal applicability\nacross all of humanity.\n\nThe next two concepts\u2014basic equivalence and functional\nconstancy\u2014are perhaps best understood as two sides of a\ndistinction between formal and functional equivalence. Basic\nequivalence refers to a similarity of form and functional constancy\nrefers to a similarity in function. Basic equivalence is a formal\nresemblance owing to a corresponding value-mode. It is a similarity in\nthe type of value, or better, being particular values of the same\ntype. This notion rests on drawing a distinction between the object of\nvaluation and the way the object is valued. The object may differ\nwhere the value mode does not. As a consequence a single object can be\nvalued multiple ways, and many different objects can be valued in the\nsame way. Take for example the institution of marriage as the object\nof valuation. Marriage is valuable in least two senses, first, it may\nbe valued as the religious union of a man and a woman, and secondly,\nthe marriage ceremony itself could be valued as a ritualized aesthetic\nexperience. In both cases one and the same phenomenon is the content\nof two different value modes. In the first instance, marriage is\nvalued religiously; the characteristic quality of the value, its form,\nis spiritual. In the second instance, marriage could be valued because\nof the elegant d\u00e9cor, grandiose ceremony, and beautiful\narrangements that characterize the event. The example goes to\nillustrate the fact that different ways of valuing can be applied to\nthe same object by the same person or by different people. Valuation\nworks the other way as well, that is, different objects can be valued\nthe same way. As for example, a marriage, a baptism, or a christening\ncan all be valued religiously or aesthetically. One can recognize a\nsimilarity in the form of competing values even though their objects\nmay differ, or a difference in form where the object stays the same.\nBasic equivalence then speaks to an identity of form not of content.\nIt is a conceptual tool that enables persons to recognize that their\nrespective value expressions are species of the same genus. Locke\nspeaks of the objective comparison of basic human values which leads\none to think that his claim is that different groups may regard\ndifferent sets of values as basic to human beings though these may not\nbe identical, but rather, formally equivalent values.\n\nThe other side of the formal/functional equivalence distinction is the\nnotion of functional constancy. By functional constancy is meant the\nability of basic equivalent values to operate as stable features of\nvalue processes and activity within various value communities. Locke\nenvisions that what will be found beneath potentially vast differences\nin content, and beyond a similarity of form, is a comparable utility\nof various values across contexts. Every value has an attendant\nfunction; a role that it plays within a given value community. Values\nthat differ either in form or in content may still be equivalent as\nregards their function. These functional constants are discovered\nthrough comparison of fundamental values found across value\ngroups.\n\nThus functional equivalence provides a constancy of two sorts: first,\nthe function is constant within a given value community insofar as it\nplays the same role for different members of the same value group, and\nsecond, the function can be a common feature across value groups.\nThink here again of the example of marriage. Admittedly, there is a\nwide variety of particular manifestations of such a value, and there\ncan be differences in the form as well as the content of such values.\nBut it is still the case that such variation results in a similar\nfunction within a value community. Children are reared, networks of\nsupport are maintained, property is held in common and bequeathed to\nsuccessive generations etc. and these social roles are served by a\nmyriad of expressions of familial ties in the community. Moreover,\nfamily values function in this way across cultures. To be sure, there\nmay not be an exact equivalence of function across value communities,\nor even within them for that matter, but to a large extent this\nequivalence of function is there to be observed. It may be the case\nthat there exist social functions for a given value in one context\nthat are absent in another: if so, there is no equivalence to be made.\nAll values have a function, but as there is no necessary connection\nbetween a given value and a particular function, it does not follow\nfrom this that every value function can be found in every culture.\n4. Relativism\n\nRelativism, for Locke, begins as a systematic approach to the\nrecognition of the sorts of value equivalence discussed earlier, and\nis then able to militate against the pernicious forms of valuing that\noften turn cultural exchanges into intractable problems. The view is\ntermed relativist because it makes a comprehensive and accurate\nunderstanding of the values of a given culture dependent\u2014at\nleast in part\u2014on that culture being viewed in relation to other\ncultures. Moreover, Locke claims that cultural relativism can serve as\n\u201ca scientifically impartial interpreter of human values, and\nsometimes even as a referee and mediator among conflicting\nvalues\u201d (CRIP 70).\n4.1 The Principle of Cultural Equivalence\n\nRelativism, on Locke's view, is not a negative skeptical position that\nis predicated upon the belief that one is unable to make a\nsatisfactory determination about the relative worth of value\ncommunities. Instead, it is a positive and affirmative position\nconcerning the relative worth of distinct value traditions and\ncultures. Locke formulates his relativism in terms of the three\nprinciples of cultural equivalence, cultural reciprocity, and cultural\nconvertibility. He claims that the three principles are derivable from\nthis larger relativist outlook and will enable \u201ca more objective\nand scientific understanding of human cultures and\u2026more\nreasonable control of their interrelationships\u201d (CRIP 73).\n\nThe first of the three principles is:\n\nThe principle of cultural equivalence, under which we would\nmore wisely press the search for functional similarity in our analyses\nand comparisons of human cultures; thus offsetting our traditional and\nexcessive emphasis upon cultural differences. Such functional\nequivalences, which we might term \u2018culture-cognates\u2019 or\n\u2018culture-correlates,\u2019 discovered underneath deceptive but\nsuperficial institutional divergence, would provide objective but\nsoundly neutral common denominators for intercultural understanding\nand cooperation. (CRIP 73)\n\n\nThe effect of the first principle is to lay bare the fact that the\nseemingly vast differences between cultures is more a matter of our\nselective preferences; that is, the habits of mind we have cultivated\nfor being more keenly attuned to difference rather than similarity.\nThe first stage of relativism, then, is to reorient our focus in favor\nof the similarity to be found across value communities. Cultural\ncognates and correlates are objective because they are discovered to\nbe real features of multiple value systems. They are in an important\nsense \u201cthere\u201d to be discovered both by internal and\nexternal observers of the value group. The reason that these value\ncognates count as neutral is that they do not, in virtue of their\nbeing objective, privilege any value-type or value-content over any\nother. At this stage they are taken as mere facts of the matter about\nthe values that exist within communities.\n4.2 The Principle of Cultural Reciprocity\n\nThe second principle of cultural relativism is:\n\nThe principle of cultural reciprocity, which, by a general recognition\nof the reciprocal character of all contacts between cultures and of\nthe fact that all modern cultures are highly composite ones, would\ninvalidate the lump estimating of cultures in terms of generalized, en\nbloc assumptions of superiority and inferiority, substituting\nscientific, point-by-point comparisons with their correspondingly\nlimited, specific, and objectively verifiable superiorities or\ninferiorities. (CRIP 73)\n\n\nThis aspect of Locke's relativism requires a \u201cbeneficent\nneutrality between divergent positions\u201d (CRIP 70\u201371). It\nbegins by fostering a disposition toward cultural toleration in the\nhope that such toleration will lead to mutual respect, which would in\nturn serve as a foundation upon which to base reciprocal exchanges\nbetween cultures. In the most likely case, these initial exchanges\nwill be centered around specific values that form narrowly defined\ncommunities of agreement. In the end, if cultural relativism is able\nto foster reciprocity between value communities to a sufficient\ndegree, then cultural relativism may well establish a foundation of\nmutual understanding and appreciation to support active cooperation\nbetween value groups. The principle of cultural reciprocity restrains\nthe inferences that we are able to make as a result of the principal\nof cultural equivalence in at least two ways: first, its emphasis on\npoint-by-point comparisons limits the scope of the value cognates that\nare discovered, and second, it issues an injunction against\nidentifying or connecting specific values with specific cultures or\nvalue communities. Relativism is to borrow from an idealized model of\nscientific practice; a point of view that does not prejudge the\nresults of a given observation before it is carried out. Moreover, it\npoints out that the discovery of cognates and correlates is not likely\nto be wholesale, but instead, specific and contextualized.\n4.3 The Principle of Cultural Convertibility\n\nFinally, we have the principle of cultural convertibility:\n\nThe principle of limited cultural convertibility, that, since culture\nelements, though widely interchangeable, are so separable, the\ninstitutional forms from their values and the values from their\ninstitutional forms, the organic selectivity and assimilative capacity\nof a borrowing culture becomes a limiting criterion for cultural\nexchange. Conversely, pressure acculturation and the mass\ntransplanting of culture, the stock procedure of groups with\ntraditions of culture \u2018superiority\u2019 and dominance, are\ncounterindicated as against both the interests of cultural efficiency\nand the natural trends of culture selectivity. (CRIP 73)\n\n\nAll value-types are independent of any given value-content; any given\nvalue-type can be joined with any value-content. This fact of\nvaluation is what grounds cross-cultural transformation. The extent to\nwhich cultures are modified by their interactions with other cultures,\nis in part a function of how stringently the cultures in question\nassociate their own value-forms with specific value-content. At a\nhigher level, Locke indicates that associations might even be made\nbetween a value and its institutional form, by which he seems to mean\nthe manner in which the value is organized into the social structure\nof a value community. If specific values are correlated with\nparticular institutional forms, a necessary connection may be assumed\nto exist between them where it does not.\n5. Aesthetics\n\nLocke is perhaps best known for his work in aesthetics, in particular,\nhis role as both an intellectual purveyor of Negro art and literary\ncritic. Locke managed to position himself at the forefront of one of\nthe most significant and important artistic rebirths in American\nhistory. His seminal work, The New Negro, was ground-breaking\nin its presentation of Negro art as thoroughly self-expressive of the\nindividual artist, and not as merely representative of aesthetic,\ncultural and social possibilities. Locke's publication of The New\nNegro was in many ways in direct defiance and contradiction of\nthe black intellectual elite of his day, most notably W. E. B. Du\nBois, as well as being the advance guard of the aesthetic sentiments\nof the average Negro of his day. There is evidence of his\nphilosophical views, especially in the areas of axiology, culture,\nrace and ethnicity throughout his writings on aesthetics. Major themes\nin Locke's aesthetics include: universal human appeal and the\nrelationship of universal and particular; the transition from folk art\nto high art; the centrality of individual expressivity; and\ncross-cultural communicability through the aesthetic.\n5.1 The New Negro\n\nPrior to the period of individual expression characteristic of the\nHarlem Renaissance, Negro art in Locke's estimation had as its primary\nfunction representation of a Negro type that was socially acceptable\nand laudably ideal. The aim of much Negro art was to advance\npresentations of the Negro as civilized, cultured, and capable of\nmaking a worthwhile contribution to American society, or to portray\nblacks in America as a progressive people, needing only to be\nliberated from slavery or Jim Crow segregation to realize their true\npotential. In discharging this representative function, Negro art was\nconsumed with the promulgation of stereotypes and counter-stereotypes.\nIt had constantly to react against negative portrayals and stifling\nsocial pressures; to attempt to make out of Negro life and experience\nsomething worthy of respect, a fitting object of honor and emulation.\nAs Locke put it, \n\nfor generations in the mind of America, the Negro has been more of a\nformula than a human being\u2014a something to be argued about,\ncondemned or defended, to be \u2018kept down,\u2019 or \u2018in his\nplace,\u2019 or \u2018helped up,\u2019 to be worried with or\nworried over, harassed or patronized, a social bogey or a social\nburden. (NN 3\u20134)\n\n\nThe primary consequence of this social environment on black aesthetics\nin the United States according to Locke was its Ghettoization. In\ndealing with this specialized subject matter of social uplift Negro\naesthetics segregates itself from the broader American social context\nand fails to achieve universal human appeal. \u201cThe thinking\nNegro,\u201d by whom Locke seems to have Du Bois primarily in mind,\n\u201chas been induced to share this same general attitude, to focus\nhis attention on controversial issues, to see himself in the distorted\nperspective of a social problem\u201d (NN 3\u20134).\n\nArt at its best on Locke's view is not propaganda, and though there\nmay be some initial phase in which art is forced to perform such a\nfunction that is not the ultimate goal. \u201cUntil recently,\u201d\nLocke comments \u201clacking self-understanding, we have been almost\nas much of a problem to ourselves as we still are to others.\u201d\nYet as \u201cthe thinking few know\u201d as that self-understanding\nis achieved and worked into artistic expression the result is\n\u201cthat in the reaction the vital inner grip of prejudice has been\nbroken\u201d (NN 4). This is the first significant change in the\nsocial environment that produces the \u201cNew Negro\u201d; namely,\nthe attitude of young Negro artist to racial segregation.\n\nAnother change in American society that had a profound impact on the\naesthetic advancement of African-Americans at the time of Locke's\npublication of The New Negro was the Great Migration. One\nmajor consequence of \u201cthat shifting of the Negro\npopulation\u201d was that it \u201cmade the Negro problem no longer\nexclusively or even predominantly Southern\u201d (NN 5). Locke did\nnot however regard the cause of the great migration as chiefly racial;\nthat is, escape from the segregation of the South was not the major\nmotivation behind the mass African-American exodus from the South to\nthe North and Mid-West. Instead,\n\nThe tide of Negro migration, northward and city-ward, is not to be\nfully explained as a blind flood started by the demands of war\nindustry coupled with the shutting off of foreign migration, or by the\npressure of poor crops coupled with increased social terrorism in\ncertain sections of the South and Southwest\u2026The wash and rush\nof this human tide on the beach line of the northern city centers is\nto be explained primarily in terms of a new vision of opportunity, of\nsocial and economic freedom, of a spirit to seize, even in the face of\nan extortionate and heavy toll, a chance for the improvement of\nconditions. (NN 6)\n\n\nThe Great Migration brought with it a need for a plurality of social\nadjustments as the droves of African-Americans flooded into Northern\ncities. Principal among this was the realization that the Negro\nwas\n\nrapidly in process of class differentiation, [and] if it ever was\nwarrantable to regard and treat the Negro en masse it is\nbecoming with every day less possible, more unjust and more\nridiculous. (NN 5\u20136)\n\n\nNegro life in America according to Locke is comprised of many diverse\nelements. The plurality of groups that congregated in places like\nDetroit, Chicago, Philadelphia and Harlem all with varying motivations\nand group specific aims constituted some of the largest concentrations\nof diverse segments of the Negro population. These circumstances\ncoupled with the oppressive effects of prejudice forced myriad sectors\nof the African-American population to discover and interact with one\nanother. Prior to that Locke claims that \n\nit must be admitted that the American Negroes have been a race more in\nname than in fact, or to be exact, more in sentiment than in\nexperience. The chief bond between them has been that of a common\ncondition rather than a common consciousness; a problem in common\nrather than a life in common. (NN 6\u20137)\n\n\nLocke explains that in part the artistic endeavors of the Negro have\nfailed to achieve universal resonance because the Negro himself has\nbeen so poorly understood. He readily admits that \u201c[i]t does not\nfollow that if the Negro were better known, he would be better liked\nor better treated[,]\u201d and goes on to note that despite this fact\n\u201cmutual understanding is basic for any subsequent cooperation\nand adjustment\u201d predicated upon, or in pursuit of an\nunderstanding of the universality of Negro experiences as expressed in\nart. Moreover, \n\neffort towards this will at least have the effect of remedying in\nlarge part what has been the most unsatisfactory feature of our\npresent stage of race relations in America, namely the fact that the\nmore intelligent and representative elements of the two race groups\nhave at so many points got quite out of vital touch with one another\n(NN 8\u20139)\n\n\nAnd in addressing that crucial fact, such efforts may go a long way\ntowards facilitating an appreciation of Negro art as expressive both\nof the peculiar racial, ethnic, and cultural experiences of\nAfrican-Americans, and as expressive of ubiquitous aspects of human\nexperience. It is a mere \u201cfiction\u2026that the life of the\nraces is separate,\u201d and a dangerously divisive one at that,\n\u201c[t]he fact is that they have touched too closely at the\nunfavorable and too lightly at the favorable levels\u201d (NN 9).\nHence, it is not simply a failure of contact, but a failure of the\nright sort of contact that accounts for the under appreciation of the\naesthetic life of black peoples.\n\nFor his part, Locke argues, the \u201cNew Negro\u201d in recognizing\n\u201cthe necessity for fuller, truer self-expression,\u2026[and]\nthe realization of the unwisdom of allowing discrimination to\nsegregate him mentally, and a counter attitude to cramp and fetter his\nown living\u201d has played a vital role in demolishing \u201cthe\n\u2018spite-wall\u2019 that the intellectuals built over the\n\u2018color-line[.]\u2019\u201d (NN, 9\u201310). Life for the\nNegro in the early 1920's was steadily progressing toward the ideals\nof American democracy. The Negro of the time was also characterized by\na new vein; one around which there was a growing consensus primarily\nof feeling and attitude; rather than opinion or program. As Locke has\nit:\n\nUp to the present one may adequately describe the Negro's \u2018inner\nobjectives\u2019 as an attempt to repair a damaged group psychology\nand reshape a warped social perspective. Their realization has\nacquired a new mentality for the American Negro. And as it matures we\nbegin to see its effects; at first, negative, iconoclastic, and then\npositive and constructive. In this new group psychology we note the\nlapse of sentimental appeal, then the development of a more positive\nself-respect and self-reliance; the repudiation of social dependence,\nand then the gradual recovery from hyper-sensitiveness and\n\u2018touchy\u2019 nerves, the repudiation of the double standard of\njudgment with its special philanthropic allowances and in the sturdier\ndesire for objective and scientific appraisal; and finally the rise\nfrom social disillusionment to race pride, from the sense of social\ndebt to the responsibilities of social contribution, and offsetting\nthe necessary working commonsense acceptance of restricted conditions,\nthe belief in ultimate esteem and recognition. Therefore, the Negro\ntoday wishes to be known for what he is, even in his faults and\nshortcomings, and scorns a craven and precarious survival at the price\nof seeming to be what he is not (NN 11).\n\n\nLocke ends his exposition of what is characteristic of the New Negro\nwith the observation that the reception of black aesthetic products is\nan experiment in democracy. As African-American art resists\nghettoization and increasingly makes its presence felt in the American\nartistic mainstream it seeks to establish itself as a subset of\nAmerican art; rather than, the totality of Negro American art. And\nsince, according to Locke,\n\n[d]emocracy itself is obstructed and stagnated to the extent that any\nof its channels are closed\u2026the choice is not between one way\nfor the Negro and another way for the rest, but between American\ninstitutions frustrated on the one hand and American ideals\nprogressively fulfilled and realized on the other. (NN 12)\n\n\nThe North American Negro artist in being \u2018new\u2019 is a living\ninstantiation of the fact that no culture, people, race, or society is\na static one. Such entities are always in process of transformation,\nand always a composite of myriad cultural, ethnic, racial, and social\ninfluences. The emergence of the new is at once a presentation of what\nhas been and an indication of what the future may hold. This is a\ndeeply pragmatic current running through Locke's aesthetic philosophy.\nLocke is later critical of the Harlem Renaissance because it failed to\nsustain a cyclical process of rebirth. In the years following the\nheight of the Harlem Renaissance he remarked later that that a new\nNegro must be born every decade or two.\n5.2 The Young Negro\n\nLocke explains that the aesthetic renaissance that took place in\nHarlem and elsewhere was primarily a movement of young artists. The\nyouth, Locke claims, speak in distinctive overtones, and \u201cout of\na unique experience and with particular representativeness\u201d (NN\n47). The experiences of young American Negroes is uniquely\nrepresentative because\n\n[a]ll classes of people under social pressure are permeated with a\ncommon experience; they are emotionally welded as others cannot be.\nWith them, even ordinary living has epic depth and lyric intensity,\nand this, their material handicap, is their spiritual advantage. (NN\n47)\n\n\nHere we find an interesting problem in Lockean exegesis: How is it\nthat the aesthetic contribution is at once characterized by a\ndisavowal of representativeness, while at the same time being uniquely\nrepresentative? Locke goes on to note that\n\n[r]acial expression as a conscious motive, it is true, is fading out\nof our latest art, but just as surely the age of truer, finer group\nexpression is coming in\u2014for race expression does not need to be\ndeliberate to be vital. Indeed, at its best it never is. (NN 47)\n\n\nLocke's resolution of the seeming paradox comes by way of recognizing\nthat \u201c[o]ur poets have now stopped speaking for the\nNegro[;]\u201d the sort of representativeness characteristic of past\naesthetic pursuits and instead now \u201cspeak as Negroes\u201d (NN\n48). The main difference being that \u201c[w]here formally they spoke\nto others and tried to interpret,\u201d the experiences of\nAfrican-Americans for white or other nonblack audiences \u201cthey\nnow speak to their own and try to express.\u201d \u201cThey\nhave\u201d he notes \u201cstopped posing, being nearer the\nattainment of poise\u201d (NN 48). With this change in the mind of\nthe Negro artist the aim of art is no longer the presentation of an\nideal type, or an effective counter-stereotype; instead, it is the\nexpression of the universal truth contained in the particularity of\nNegro experiences.\n\nThis is a major theme that runs throughout all of Locke's aesthetic\nphilosophy; the idea that within a particular manifestation of human\nexperience can be found something of universal human significance.\nIndeed, this is the quintessential marker of \u201chigh art\u201d or\n\u201cclassical art\u201d. In the case of the young Negro artist\nLocke claims \u201c[r]ace for them is but an idiom of experience, a\nsort of added enriching adventure and discipline, giving subtler\novertones to life, making it more beautiful and interesting, even if\nmore poignantly so. When viewed from this more objective attitude and\n\u201cso experienced, it affords a deepening rather than narrowing of\nsocial vision\u201d (NN 48).\n\nThe youth \u201cconstitute a new generation, not because of years\nonly, but because of the new aesthetic and a new philosophy of\nlife\u201d (NN 49). Locke explicates this new aesthetic philosophy by\nway of comparison to \u201c[t]he elder generation of Negro\nwriters\u201d who were resigned to expressing themselves in\n\u201ccautious moralism and guarded idealizations\u201d (NN 49).\nThis generation of artists, with\n\nthe repercussions of prejudice\u2026heavy on its heart\u2026felt\nart must fight social battles and compensate social wrongs; \u201cBe\nrepresentative\u201d: put the better foot foremost, was the\nunderlying mood. (NN 50)\n\n\nThis hampered both the individual expressivity of the older generation\nof artists as well as their ability to communicate cross culturally\nthe truth of black experiences. The artist was not free to speak his\nheart or mind, but had to remain cognizant of the way he presented the\nNegro yet again. With the youth of the Harlem Renaissance there came a\n\u201cnewer motive,\u201d for the younger generation of American\nNegro artists the aim \u201cin being racial is to be so purely for\nthe sake of art.\u201d (NN 51) The new artist does not take folksy\nracial types to be emblematic of anything but the individual artist.\nLocke sees this manifested in the artist's ability to make of\n\u201cthe racial substance something technically distinctive,\u201d\na method of giving expression to a specific type of experience that\nallows for full expression of that experience across cultural, racial,\nor ethnic boundaries. In this way techniques that exist as \u201can\nidiom of style may become a contribution to general resources of\nart\u201d; (NN 51) available in the end, not only to those who\ncreated, cultivated and refined them, but to any artist who wished to\ndeal with that particular idiom.\n5.3 The Negro Spirituals\n\nIn Locke's estimation, the spirituals are the quintessential Negro\ncontribution to American art and culture; manifesting as they do so\nmuch, not only about the North American Negro and his aesthetic and\ncultural heritage and evolution, but also in standing as a paragon of\nprocesses of aesthetic transition and development.\n\nThe spirituals are really the most characteristic product of the race\ngenius as yet in America. But the very elements which make them\nuniquely expressive of the Negro make them at the same time deeply\nrepresentative of the soil that produced them. Thus, as unique\nspiritual products of American life, they become nationally as well as\nracially characteristic. It may not be readily conceded now that the\nsong of the Negro is America's folksong; but if the spirituals are\nwhat we think them to be, a classical folk expression, then this is\ntheir ultimate destiny. Already they give evidence of this classic\nquality. Through their immediate and compelling universality of\nappeal, through their untarnishable beauty, they seem assured of the\nimmortality of those great folk expressions that survive not so much\nthrough being typical of a group or representative of a period as by\nvirtue of being fundamentally and everlastingly human. (NN 199)\n\n\nThe best evidence, Locke seems to think, in support of the spirituals'\nclaim to universality is that they have withstood the test of time. As\nan art form they have outlived not only the generations that produced\nthem but the peculiar social environment that enlivened them. Beyond\nthis the spirituals have survived\n\nthe contempt of the slave owners, the conventionalizations of formal\nreligion, the repressions of Puritanism, the corruptions of\nsentimental balladry, and the neglect and disdain of second-generation\nrespectability. (NN 199)\n\n\nIn short, they have successfully made the transition from folk art to\nformal music.\n\nThe spirituals at once exemplify all of the three major themes of\nLocke's aesthetic philosophy: they are expressive of the individuality\nof a given artist\u2014think of the distinctiveness of Paul Robeson's\nbaritone renderings of \u201cSwing Low, Sweet Chariot\u201d; they\nhave universal human appeal; and they epitomize the process of\ntransition from a folk art to high or classical art. \u201cIn its\ndisingenuous simplicity, folk art is always despised and rejected at\nfirst; but generations after, it flowers again and transcends the\nlevel of its origin\u201d (NN 199).\n\nNegro folk music or spirituals contain the raw material for myriad new\nmusical developments. That material was at the time of the publication\nof The New Negro to Locke's mind underdeveloped, but as Negro\nartists grew in sophistication and craft Locke saw the potential for\nthem to complete the conversion of so fundamentally American and\npedestrian an art form into an avenue for insight into some of the\nmost deeply emotional aspects of humanity.\n\nLocke credits Du Bois with being among the first to give the\nspirituals \u201ca serious and proper social interpretation,\u201d\nwith his chapter in The Souls of Black Folks on the Sorrow\nSongs. \u201cBut underneath the broken words, childish imagery,\npeasant simplicity, lies\u201d Locke notes\n\nas Dr. Du Bois pointed out, and epic intensity and a tragic profundity\nof emotional experience, for which the only historical analogy is the\nspiritual experience of the Jews and the only analogue, the Psalms.\n(NN 200)\n\n\nBut whatever they may lack in terms of poetic form, they more than\ncompensate for in their ability to embody the religious mood. This\nNorth American Negro folk form is replete with the spirit of\nexaltation. The spirituals are remarkable for their ability to\ntranscend the profound tragedy that gives birth to them and offer up a\nmodel of enduring hopefulness in this world or the next. \u201cTheir\nwords are colloquial,\u201d Locke notes, being the products of\nunlettered folk \u201cbut their mood is epic\u201d giving emotive\nexpression to experiences that exemplify the possibilities of humanity\nat its best (NN 201). The spirituals \u201care primitive, but their\nemotional artistry is perfect\u201d (NN 201).\n\nHistorically, Negro colleges were the mechanism through which the\nspirituals were popularized. The travelling choirs of Negro\ninstitutions such as Hampton University, Wilberforce University, Fisk\nUniversity and Tuskegee University performed the spirituals across the\ncountry as a means of raising funds for their respective institutions,\nall the while bringing to black and white audiences in the United\nStates knowledge and appreciation of this indigenous musical form.\nMany of these university choirs also recorded compilations of Negro\nspirituals and published them. It was thus, as Locke has it, that the\nspirituals were able to avoid simply falling out of fashion and\nfailing to survive \u201cthat critical period of disfavor in which\nany folk product is likely to be snuffed out by the false pride of the\nsecond-generation\u201d (NN 202). This, by Locke's lights, is not an\nuncommon situation for folk arts to face, finding it necessary as they\noften do to resist being disavowed by subsequent generations wishing\nto distance themselves from the supposedly deficient quality of the\nfolk expression.\n\nEmotions and attitudes form the very foundation of Locke's philosophy\nof value: undoubtedly, one reason that Locke was so enamored with the\nspirituals was that as he understood them their primary artistic\nvirtue was their deeply emotive character. \u201cEmotionally,\u201d\nhe points out, \u201cthese songs are far from simple\u201d (NN 205).\nThere is to be found in the spiritual folk music of the American Negro\nthe entire range of human moods and emotions, and within a given\nspiritual there can be a drastic change in mood from the deepest\nsorrow to glorious praise, as each and every song is infused with\nreligious sentiment. Surprisingly, when it comes to the problem of\nclassification of the spirituals, Locke does not insist upon the\nprimary mode of classification being the feeling-quality of the song\nas his value theory might suggest. In fact, Locke argues that\n\n[i]nteresting and intriguing as was Dr. Du Bois's analysis of their\nemotional themes, modern interpretation must break with that mode of\nanalysis, and relate these songs to the folk activity that they\nmotivated, classifying them by their respective song-types. (NN 205)\n\n\nIn the case of the spirituals Locke is in favor of a different method\nof classification because contemporary interpreters of the Negro's\nmusic tend to mischaracterize, or characterize in a way that is not\ntrue to the folk that produced it, the music of the Negro. Locke\nlaments the fact that \u201cat present many a half secularized ballad\nis mistaken for a \u2018spiritual,\u2019 and many a camp-meeting\nshout for a folk hymn\u201d (NN 205). He believed the folk music of\nthe Negro is best categorized according to the sort of activity they\ninspired. \u201cFrom this point of view\u201d Locke claims\n\nwe have essentially four classes, the almost ritualistic prayer songs\nfor pure spirituals, the freer and more unrestrained evangelical\nshouts or Meeting songs, the folk ballad so overlaid with the\ntradition of the spirituals proper that the distinctive type quality\nhas almost been unnoticed until late, and the work and labor songs of\nstrictly secular character. (NN 205)\n\n\nHowever, discriminating Negro folk music into types on the basis of\nthe folk activity that underlies them is not necessarily to exclude\nthe emotive content of the song. In fact, it seems that what is really\nbeing discriminated is the active expression of the underlying\nemotional content, i.e., the activity that is most commonly associated\nwith a particular emotion or mood. And here we see perhaps the most\ndirect effect that Locke's axiology has on his assessment of\nspirituals discriminating them as he does into types in terms of their\nfeeling-quality, but also linking each form with a set of imperatives\nin this case, a practical imperative understood by the type of\nactivity that each song is used to motivate.\n\nLocke sees as a major problem with the scholarship on Negro folk music\nin his day the tendency to overemphasize one of the various\ndistinctive elements of the music over the others. The result was a\njaundiced view of Negro music. \u201cStrain out and emphasize the\nmelodic element\u201d Locke informs\n\nand you get only the sentimental ballad; emphasize the harmonic idiom,\nand you get a cloying sentimental glee; overemphasize the rhythmic\nidiom and instantly you secularize the product into syncopated dance\nelements. (NN 206)\n\n5.4 Who, and What, is \u201cNegro\u201d?\n\nLurking in the background of all of this talk of the \u201cNew\nNegro\u201d is the assumption that there is something distinctively\nNegro about at least some American art. As to what that is, or could\nbe, answers are sometimes extremely hard to come by. But, Locke warns\n\n\n[s]ooner or later the critic must face the basic issues involved in\nhis use of risky and perhaps untenable terms like \u2018Negro\nart\u2019 and \u2018Negro literature\u2019 and answer the\nmuch-evaded question unequivocally,\u2014who and what is Negro? (WWN\n209)\n\n\nBeyond this Locke thinks it a meaningful query to ask whether the\nracial concept has any place in art at all. Perhaps it would be better\nto understand art as a cultural or social mode of production that cuts\nacross racial and ethnic divisions.\n5.4.1 Who is Negro?\n\nIn answering the question \u201cWho is Negro?\u201d Locke begins by\nexposing a common misguided assumption in such queries:\n\n[t]he fallacy of the \u2018new\u2019 as of the \u2018older\u2019\nthinking is that there is a type Negro who, either qualitatively or\nquantitatively, is the type symbol of the entire group. (WWN 210)\n\n\nLocke sees this as the unfortunate consequence of the past need to\nproffer counter-stereotypes to combat demeaning stereotypes of Negro\npersons. Counter-stereotypes may well contain some element of truth,\nbut they fail to convey the whole truth about as diverse a population\nof human beings as Negroes in the United States, let alone the\nAmericas or Negroes the World over. There is no distinctive singular\nNegro type. The answer then to the question posed \u201cwho is\nNegro?\u201d is no Negro in particular. The Negro is a dynamic and\nmultifaceted population admitting of myriad cultural and social forms\ncharacterized as those are by variegated linguistic, religious and\nartistic elements. This is important for Locke to note as the Negro of\nhis day was thought to be classless, undifferentiated, and ethnically\nhomogeneous. In fact, Locke himself thought it possible (and actual)\nfor human beings biologically similar in the way that American race\nthinking presupposes to be members of different races. A full and\naccurate artistic portrayal of who is Negro would, Locke argued, have\nto picture the many diverse Negro strands in their own right, weaving\ntogether from these diverse threads a multifaceted presentation of\nNegro experiences.\n5.4.2 What is Negro?\n\n\u201cTurning to the other basic question,\u2014what is\nNegro,\u201d Locke begins by narrowing the question to \u201cwhat\nmakes a work of art Negro, if indeed any such nomenclature is\nproper,\u2014its authorship, its theme or its idiom?\u201d (WWN\n211). In other words, what gives a particular work of art its\ndistinctive, if any, racial character: the racial identity of its\nauthor, its treatment of themes characteristic of a particular racial\nexperience in a particular place, or its use of styles and modes of\nexpression peculiar to a given people? Of these three candidates for\nthe foundation of Negro art Locke claims each has had its day\ndepending on the social environment that was prevalent at the time.\nLocke dismisses nearly out of hand the first option remarking that\nmany a Negro artist has produced the most amateurish works of art due\nprimarily to their poor mastery of Negro idioms, and inadequate\ntreatment of Negro themes. What is more, some white (or at least\nnon-Negro) artist have been quite adept in either their use of\ncharacteristically Negro styles, or their dealings with Negro motifs.\nOf course, it stands to reason that artist steeped in the cultural,\nethnic and racial environments that give rise to these idioms and\nthemes are most likely to master their use and expression, and that\npersons who do so are most likely to be members of these communities,\nhaving the same racial, ethnic or cultural identities as other\nmembers. However, such communal membership is not a necessary\ncondition for the work of a particular artist to count amongst the\nworks that comprise a racially distinctive body of art such as might\nbe called \u201cNegro art.\u201d\n6. Philosophy of Race\n\nLocke understood race as primarily a product of social culture. Locke\ndenies as do nearly all contemporary race theorists that races are\nbiologically distinct categories of human beings. Locke maintained\nthat culture and race were distinct, but often overlapping categories.\nThere is no tight causal or otherwise necessary connection between\nrace and culture. The two are mutually exclusive even though they do\nsometimes vary together or otherwise correspond. Race, for Locke, is\nnot determinative of culture or civilization. Locke's position on race\ndoes not deny, as some of his contemporaries concerned with the notion\nof race and culture did, that there ever is a significant connection\nbetween racial and cultural factors, nor does it deny that \u201crace\nstands for significant social characters and culture-traits or\nrepresents in given historical contexts characteristic\ndifferentiations of culture-type\u201d (CRASC 188). This is primarily\na cautionary observation on Locke's part seeing as how\n\n[i]t is too early to assume that there is no significant relationship\nbetween race and culture because of the manifestly false and arbitrary\nlinkage which has previously been asserted. (CRASC 189)\n\n\nLocke has some hesitation about the prudence and possibility of\ncompletely eradicating racial categories. He states,\n\n[i]n some revised and reconstructed form, we may anticipate the\ncontinued even if restricted use of these terms as more or less\nnecessary and basic concepts that cannot be eliminated altogether, but\nthat must nevertheless be so safe-guarded in this continued use as not\nto give further currency to the invalidated assumption concerning\nthem. (CRASC 189)\n\n\nLocke attributes the original idea that race is a primary determining\nfactor in culture to the work of Arthur de Gobineau, though he thinks\nthe main scientific justification for the view has been offered by\nthose who seek to interpret culture in evolutionary terms such as the\nsocial evolutionism of Herbert Spencer. Positing a fixed link between\nrace and culture was useful for such theorists in developing a\nstep-by-step account of the development of cultures. But even in\nLocke's day, the supposed scientific foundations of such theoretical\npositions faced challenges. In light of that Locke thinks it\nunderstandable for some to want to correct this misinterpretation of\nthe facts by insisting that there is no connection at all between race\nand culture. We see here again perhaps some of the influence that\npragmatist thinkers, in this case Dewey, may have had on Locke, as\nDewey was apt to point out on numerous occasions the shortcomings of\nSpencer's social Darwinism, and chiefly its attempt to offer a\nuniversal account of all aspects of human development. Locke worried\nthat extreme cultural relativism\n\nleaves an open question as to the association of certain ethnic groups\nwith definite culture traits and culture types under circumstances\nwhere there is evidently a greater persistence of certain strains and\ncharacteristics in their culture than of other factors.\n\n\nIt is \u201c[t]he stability of such factors and their resistance to\ndirect historical modification\u201d Locke thought, which\n\nmarks out the province of that aspect of the problem of race which is\ndistinctly ethnological and which the revised notion of ethnic race\nmust cover. (CRASC 190)\n\n6.1 Theoretical and Scientific Conceptions of Race\n\nLocke postulates three conceptions of race: theoretical or scientific,\npolitical, and social or cultural. Scientific conceptions posit race\nas natural biological kinds. The existence of race and racial\ndifferentiation are explained in terms of biological or ethnological\nfeatures of human populations. Scientific theories frequently assert a\nnatural biological hierarchy between races and aim to explain\ndivergent cultural characteristics of groups though biological\nfactors. Locke argues that genetic inheritance varies both within and\nbetween human populations and cannot be the basis for the sociological\nconcept of race. The factors that create genetic subdivisions of the\nhuman species such as physical and social reproductive isolation\nproduce various consequences (Locke, 1989, 190 \u2013 92 see also\nLocke, 1992, 4\u20136) that may not vary conterminously with the\ngroup\u2019s social history. Genetic subdivisions produce population\nvariances that may not track the social distinctions that a given\nsociety deems salient in terms of group identity.\n\nLocke argues that biological race is an ethnic fiction. (Locke, 1992,\n11 \u2013 12). Putative biological races do not necessarily\ncorrespond with the racialized social identities operative in a given\nsociety. One way race can be an ethnic fiction is when\nnon-biologically determined ethnic or cultural groups are presumed to\nbe real biological populations, when in fact they are not. Locke does\nnot seem to think that this fictitious conception of race undermines\nthe social reality of the phenomenon. On Locke\u2019s view race\namounts to something significant even if many common conceptions of it\nare mistaken. Racialized populations can be comprised from various\ngenetic, cultural and ethnic intermixtures throughout its history.\nIsolating any one of the plurality of factors around which a\npopulation is racialized as the single factor constituting the race\ncan cause a significant divergence between one\u2019s conception of\nracial groups and any underlying reality. Such divergence can inform a\nwhole host of mistaken beliefs and misguided racial practices. Locke\nwrites: \u201c[a]s I pointed out, these groups, from the point of\nview of anthropology, are ethnic fictions. This does not mean that\nthey do not exist, but it can be shown [that these groups do] not have\nas [permanent] designations those very factors upon which they pride\nthemselves. (Locke, 1992, 11)\n\nLocke\u2019s understanding of race is influenced by the ethnology of\nhis time. The notion that racial types are not permanent he derives\nfrom Frantz Boas. (Locke, 1992, 75\u201376) Locke\u2019s belief that\nrace and culture vary independently of each and are thus not causally\nlinked stems from the work of R. H. Lowie. (Locke, 1989, 189\u201390)\nLocke agreed with Sapir that unique cultural or ethnic traits are best\nexplained historically; rather than, biologically or psychologically.\n(Locke, 1989, 190) His reading of Flinders-Petrie\u2019s account of\nassimilative processes initially informed his view of social race, and\nracial differentiation, though these are latter most influenced by his\nconcept of cultural pluralism. (Locke, 1989, 191\u201392) Finally, he\nderives the view that race practices are deeply rooted in imperialism\nfrom Lord Cromer. (Locke, 1992, 64)\n6.2 Political Conceptions of Race\n\nPolitical conceptions of race reject two basic assumptions of\nscientific theories, they reject that races are distinct biologically\ndetermined populations, and secondarily reject that biological\ndifferences of race account for cultural variation, or establish the\nrelative inferiority or superiority of putative race groups. Political\nconceptions of race contend that racism is constitutive of races.\nRacial groups result from political, economic, and social mechanisms\nthat create relative group advantage or disadvantage. Racial\ndifferentiation and hierarchy are the consequences of group exercise\nof political power.\n\nPolitical race, for Locke, is merely favorable or unfavorable social\ninheritance masquerading as genetic ethnic inheritance. Racial\ndifferences and inequalities are caused by these factors, and so, will\nnot account for the duration or amelioration of inequalities and\ndifferentiations. The permanence of racial groups, if it is to be\npromoted, must be based on something other than metaphysical realist\nnotions of race. Conversely, if racial inequalities are to be\neradicated, that too will likely require attention to, and control of,\nfactors and elements of putatively racial groups other than their\nsupposed biological or anthropological similarity.\n\nCharacteristically racial modes of living are wrongly regarded as\nbiologically, rather than, socially inherited. This social inheritance\ncan be either favorable or unfavorable. Locke observes that cultures\nare often racially diverse. Multiple races may share some larger\ncultural elements. (Locke, 1989, 193\u201394) Races are regarded as\n\u201cconcrete culture-types,\u201d according to Locke, which are\n\u201ccomposite racially speaking, and have only an artificial ethnic\nunity, of historical derivation and manufacture.\u201d (Locke, 1989,\n194) Race is a learned epistemic mode of being. A sense of race\nmembership is enculturated and socialized, and once acquired, the race\nsense partly conditions how one perceives and understands the\nworld.\n6.3 Social or Cultural Conceptions of Race\n\nLocke\u2019s social conception of race is a proto-social\nconstructionist account of race. Race, for him, is a\ncultural-historical phenomenon and not a natural kind distinction.\nRace, for Locke, is culture; or conversely, culture is race. The\ncultural conception views race as a learned socially inherited\nphenomenon. Culturally conceived, a race is a transactionally\nconstituted, and inherently transformational, subcultural variant, not\nfixed by biological determinants. Race for Locke is the characteristic\ndifferentiation of culture-type perpetuated through social heredity.\nLocke states that \u201c[r]ace in the vital and basic sense is simply\nand primarily the culture-heredity, and that in its blendings and\ndifferentiations is properly analyzed on the basis of conformity to or\nvariance from culture-type.\u201d (Locke, 1989, 192) Locke\u2019s\nview of social race implies that there are further distinctions to\nmake within current racial categories. Many groups commonly regarded\nas one race constitute several different races.\n\nLocke held that race was in point of fact a social and cultural\ncategory rather than a biological one. For this reason he developed\nthe notion of ethnic race or culture group. By ethnic race, I take\nLocke to mean a peculiar set of psychological and affective responsive\ndispositions, expressed or manifested as cultural traits, socially\ninherited and able to be attributed through historical\ncontextualization to a specifiable group of people. The concept of\nethnic race is a way of preserving the demonstrated distinctiveness of\nvarious groupings of human beings in terms of characteristic traits,\nlifestyles, forms of expression; without resulting to the\nscientifically invalidated notion of biological race.\n\u201cRace,\u201d Locke argues \u201cwould have been regarded as\nprimarily a matter of social [as opposed to biological]\nheredity,\u201d if only the science of his day had reached a more\ntenable understanding of the relationship of race to culture which\nwould likely have resulted from focusing more on the ethnic; rather\nthan, anthropological factors. The distinctiveness of a given race\nwould be understood as the result of \u201cthe selective\npsychological \u201cset\u201d of established cultural\nreactions\u201d (CRASC 191).\n\nThe notion of ethnic race is better able to capture the myriad\ndifferences between culture groups in terms of the actual social,\ncultural and historical conditions that give rise to such variation,\nand without the scientifically indefensible reliance on biological\nfactors. On this view, race is no longer thought to be the progenitor\nof culture; instead race is understood to be a cultural product. Locke\nheld that the more objective analysis of culture he advocated would\nlikely result in the development over time of distinctive\nculture-types for which it may prove possible to work out some\nprinciple of development or evolution. This he thought might\neventually make it possible to develop \u201ca standard of value for\nrelative culture grading\u201d (CRASC 194).\n\nNearly every culture is highly composite; consisting as most due in\nthe union of various social and historical influences; moreover, every\nethnic group in the unique outcome of a specific social history. A\nmore scientific understanding of man replaces the abstract artifice of\nbiological race, and requires that we deal with concrete culture-types\nwhich are frequently complex amalgamations of supposed races united\nprincipally by entrenchment of customary reactions, standardized\npractices, traditional forms of expression and interaction, in sum,\nthe specific history of a given people in a particular place. It is\nnoteworthy and perhaps illuminating of Locke's conception of ethnic or\nsocial race that the groupings of human persons formerly thought to\nconstitute \u201craces\u201d in the biological sense such as\n\u201cNegro,\u201d \u201cCaucasian,\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d\nare in fact each composed of several different social or ethnic races.\nOn Locke's view there are many so-called \u201cNegro,\u201d\n\u201cCaucasian,\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d races. This revised\nunderstanding of culture constitutes in Locke's estimation a\nfundamental paradigm shift in the study of human cultures \u201d[s]o\nconsiderable\u2026[in] emphasis and meaning that at times it does\nseem that the best procedure would be to substitute the term\nrace the term culture group\u201c (CRASC 194).\n\nLocke quickly notes while the notion of race has been invalidated as\nan explanation of culture groups understood as totalities, race does\nhelp to explain various cultural components within a given culture.\n\u201cRace operates as tradition,\u201d Locke noted, \u201cas\npreferred traits and values,\u201d changes in these aspects of\nculture in a distinctive way by a subset of a culture group\nconstitutes \u201cethnic remoulding\u201d (CRASC 195). Race becomes\na term that designates the specific outcome of the \u201cpeculiar\nselective preferences\u201d in favor of some, and against other,\nculture-traits of a given group. \u201cSuch facts\u201d Locke\nobserved\n\nnullify two of the most prevalent popular and scientific fallacies,\nthe ascription of a total culture to any one ethnic strain, and the\ninterpretation of culture in terms of the intrinsic rather than the\nfusion of its various constituent elements. (CRASC 195)\n\n\nTo illustrate Locke\u2019s view consider African Americans, they\nshare a common culture with white Americans in terms of language,\nreligion, aesthetic sense, and many other cultural elements. Even with\nthese cultural elements in common there are characteristic,\nqualitatively distinct, and phenomenologically unique forms that\ncommon language, religion, and aesthetic sense have among African\nAmericans that are not characteristic of white Americans.\nCharacteristic differences such as have produced the musical styles,\nliterary techniques, humor, oratorical idioms, mannerisms, forms of\nworship and religious expression, hair styles etc. and many other\nelements of culture that are the frequent objects of\nappropriation.\n\nA sense of kinship among members of a subcultural group which yields\nan understanding that \u201cdifferent practices [operate in] their\nsociety from those which [operate in other societies and therefore]\ndetermine their treatment of other groups,\u201d Locke argues is a\nkey element in racial differentiation. (Locke, 1992, 20) Racial\nconsciousness is not itself pernicious, but a group\u2019s sense of\nitself and its difference from other social races can be based on the\ndomination and oppression of other groups. (Locke, 1992, 20)\n\nA social group\u2019s sense of itself as a distinctive subculture\nyields the formation of peculiar values and beliefs, alongside\nspecific practices and forms of living. These produce over time\ndistinguishing qualities of the subculture in terms of elements that\nare noticeably present in one, or lacking from other groups. (Locke,\n1989, 194\u201396) Culture-traits\u2014ways of acting, speaking,\ninterrelating, worshipping, eating, expressing etc.\u2014establishes\na dominant and characteristic pattern in a population. This pattern\nconsists of social norms toward which members of the group conform.\nWith sufficient conformity around those norms a culture-type is\neventually established. (Locke, 1989, 194\u201395) Some people\nself-identify in racial terms, but the core elements with which they\nidentify may be illusory. Such identification can benefit a racialized\ngroup. Observing that some racial conceptions are ethnic fictions does\nnot lead Locke to deny the practical utility of racial\nidentification.\n6.4 Race Creeds, Race Practices, Racial Difference and Prejudice\n\nPolitical and social conceptions of race are more useful in explaining\nracial domination and cultural assimilation and pluralism than\nscientific theories of race, which have been thoroughly undermined as\nthe cause of cultural variation. Moreover, the distinctions made, the\nvery populations designated by, anthropological race, rarely if ever\ncoincide with those of ethnic race. The three conceptions carve up the\nworld differently, and of them, Locke finds the political analysis and\nsocial or ethnic conception of race more accurate historically and\nsociologically. This is a matter of some debate in recent work in the\nphilosophy of race. Also, advances in recent decades have raised\nimportant questions about the viability and usefulness of treating\ngenetically discernable populations of human beings as races. Locke\nprovides us further reason to doubt the viability of such projects.\nMoreover, he was adept enough to envision that even in the light of\nsuch advances it is a separate question whether the genetic\npopulations of evolutionary biologists track closely the social\npopulations putatively taken to be races.\n\nPutatively biological conceptions of race, Locke argues, are social\nfictions. This aligns his thinking with fictionalist, or antirealist\naccounts of race, and inclines him in the direction of racial\neliminativism. He argues that theoretical and scientific conceptions\nof race are misguided and ought to be eliminated for metaphysical,\nepistemological and normative reasons. Despite this he regards race as\na fundamental category for understanding human social interactions.\nThis informs his view that political conceptions of race are useful\nfor understanding the way a society\u2019s race creeds can rest on\nfalse beliefs, race practices are misguided and effectuate oppression,\nand understanding of the role of race in advancing imperialism and\ncolonialism. In good pragmatist fashion, Locke is careful not to\ninterpret political conceptions of race as postulating race as a\nmetaphysical reality. His political conception of race offers a model\nfor interpreting and analyzing a society\u2019s racial creeds and\nrace practices, it does not establish that race is a real biological\nor cultural factor of human populations or of individual persons.\nLocke argues that the only viable meaning of race is social. The\nconception of social race is for Locke the only plausible meaning of\nrace. This aligns him with contemporary social constructionist. Locke\nendorses a form of substitutionism by contending that metaphysically\nrealist conceptions of race should be abandoned in favor of ethnic or\nsocial race. His view is reconstructionist in that it aims to correct\nclassical racialist views as well as the prevailing metaphysically\nrealist views of his day.\n\nLocke distinguishes between racial conceptions and a society\u2019s\nrace practices. The social differentiations that produce various\nsocial groupings including races, result on his analysis from social,\npolitical, and economic causes. Locke does not deny that racial\ndifferences or racial prejudices exist. Racial differences, he\nthought, often parallel racial inequalities. (Locke, 1992, 1\u201314)\nLocke claims that \u201c[w]e should expect naturally that race theory\nshould be a philosophy of the dominant group.\u201d (Locke, 1992, 3)\nAs it was in the United States and other European colonial powers\nwhose members proffered racial theories that privileged dominant\ngroups. This leads Locke to argue that much of what has passed for\nrace theory in Western civilizations is \u201cbad science.\u201d\nSpecious justifications of exploitive and oppressive race practices\nabound, and such theories, Locke observes are resistant to correction\nby more accurate scientific investigation, or social scientific or\nhistorical facts.\n\nLocke is doubtful of the prospects of a thorough-going racial\neliminativism. He writes: \u201cI believe that a word and an idea\ncovering so indispensable, useful, and necessary a grouping in human\nsociety will never vanish, never be eradicated, and that the only\npossible way in which a change will come about will be through a\nsubstitution of better meanings for the meanings which are now so\ncurrent under the term.\u201d (Locke, 1992, 84\u201385) This is a\nclear articulation of Locke\u2019s racial substitutionism. He rejects\neliminativism as the appropriate response to problematic conceptions\nof race or pernicious race practices and creeds. But Locke, unlike Du\nBois, is not clearly a racial conservationist. He argues that\nprevailing conceptions of race are illegitimate, present race\npractices are pernicious, and contemporary race creeds unjust.\n\nLocke is arguably a qualified or partial eliminativist as he advocates\na radical redefinition of race in terms of culture, the elimination of\ncertain race practices, race creeds, and race prejudices. Race\nprejudices, Locke claims, are ultimately based on cultural differences\nand differences in the type of civilization. Racial difference is at\nbase a difference in the social consciousness of groups. Race\nprejudice erroneously assigns that variation to biological and\nanthropological factors that are unrelated to racial groups. This\nleaves racial prejudice in the paradoxical situation of being\n\u201can almost instinctive aberration in favor of anthropological\nfactors erected into social distinctions\u201d without any scientific\nwarrant for so doing. (Locke, 1992, 10)\n\nRace prejudices, Locke claims, result from aberrant psychological\npredispositions and tendencies. These habits often function\nunconsciously, but are not exempt from control and amelioration.\nMoreover, race creeds are for Locke distorted conceptual schemes and\nat the root of our notions of racial superiority and inferiority. Race\nprejudice and race creeds can and should be eliminated as features of\nrace practice. His racial eliminativism is partial or qualified\nbecause he advocates jettisoning the more pernicious forms of our race\npractice, and is adamant about substituting current racial conceptions\nfor the view of race as social culture.\n",
