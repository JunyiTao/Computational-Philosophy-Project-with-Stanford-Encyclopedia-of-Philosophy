The \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cMe\u201d\n\nOne of Mead\u2019s most significant contributions to social\npsychology is his distinction between the \u201cI\u201d and the\n\u201cMe.\u201d It\u2019s worth emphasizing that while this\ndistinction is utilized in sociological circles, it is grounded\nphilosophically for Mead. His target, in part, is no less than the\nidea of the transcendental ego, especially in its Kantian incarnation.\nIt is also important to note that the \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cMe\u201d are functional distinctions for Mead, not\nmetaphysical ones. He refers to them as phases of the self (MSS 178,\n200), although he more typically uses the word self to refer to the\n\u201cMe\u201d (Aboulafia 2016).\n\nThe self that arises in relationship to a specific generalized other\nis referred to as the \u201cMe.\u201d The \u201cMe\u201d is a\ncognitive object, which is only known retrospectively, that is, on\nreflection. When we act in habitual ways we are not typically\nself-conscious. We are engaged in actions at a non-reflective level.\nHowever, when we take the perspective of the generalized other, we are\nboth \u201cwatching\u201d and forming a self in relationship to the\nsystem of behaviors that constitute this generalized other. So, for\nexample, if I am playing second base, I may reflect on my position as\na second baseman, but to do so I have to be able to think of\n\u201cmyself\u201d in relationship to the whole game, namely, the\nother actors and the rules of the game. We might refer to this\ncognitive object as my (second baseman) baseball self or\n\u201cMe.\u201d Perhaps a better example might be to think of the\nself in relationship to one\u2019s family of origin. In this\nsituation, one views oneself from the perspective of the various sets\nof behaviors that constitute the family system.\n\nTo return to the baseball example, one may have a self, a\n\u201cMe,\u201d that corresponds to a particular position that one\nplays, which is nested within the game as an organized totality. This\nself, however, doesn\u2019t tell us how any particular play may be\nmade. When a ball is grounded to a second baseman, how he or she\nreacts is not predetermined. He reacts, and how he reacts is always to\nsome degree different from how he has reacted in the past. These\nreactions or actions of the individual, whether in response to others\nor self-initiated, fall within the \u201csphere\u201d of the\n\u201cI.\u201d Every response that the \u201cI\u201d makes is\nsomewhat novel. Its responses may differ only in small ways from\nprevious responses, making them functionally equivalent, but they will\nnever be exactly the same. No catch in a ball game is ever identical\nto a previous catch. Mead declares that, \u201cThe \u2018I\u2019\ngives the sense of freedom, of initiative. The situation is there for\nus to act in a self-conscious fashion. We are aware of ourselves, and\nof what the situation is, but exactly how we will act never gets into\nexperience until after the action takes place\u201d (MSS,\n177\u2013178). The \u201cI\u201d is a \u201csource\u201d of both\nspontaneity and creativity. For Mead, however, the \u201cI\u201d is\nnot a noumenal ego. Nor is it a substance. It is a way of designating\na locus of activity.\n\nThe responses of the \u201cI\u201d are non-reflective. How the\n\u201cI\u201d reacts is known only on reflection, that is, after we\nretrospect.\n\nIf you ask, then, where directly in your own experience the\n\u201cI\u201d comes in, the answer is that it comes in as a\nhistorical figure. It is what you were a second ago that is the\n\u201cI\u201d of the \u201cme.\u201d It is another\n\u201cme\u201d that has to take that r\u00f4le. You cannot get the\nimmediate response of the \u201cI\u201d in the process. (MSS, 174)\n\n\nIn other words, once the actions of the \u201cI\u201d have become\nobjectified and known, by definition they have become a\n\u201cMe.\u201d The status of the \u201cI\u201d is interesting in\nMead. In trying to differentiate it from the empirical, knowable,\n\u201cMe,\u201d he states, \u201cThe \u2018I\u2019 is the\ntranscendental self of Kant, the soul that James conceived behind the\nscene holding on to the skirts of an idea to give it an added\nincrement of emphasis\u201d (MSC in SW, 141). However, this statement\nshould not to be interpreted as endorsing the notion of a\ntranscendental ego. Mead is seeking to emphasize that the\n\u201cI\u201d is not available to us in our acts, that is, it is\nonly knowable in its objectified form as a \u201cMe.\u201d This\npoint is clarified by a remark that directly follows the statement\njust cited. \u201cThe self-conscious, actual self in social\nintercourse is the objective \u2018me\u2019 or\n\u2018me\u2019s\u2019 with the process of response continually\ngoing on and implying a fictitious \u2018I\u2019 always out of sight\nof himself\u201d (MSC in SW, 141). A transcendental ego is not\nfictitious. But for Mead, since we are dealing with a functional\ndistinction here, it is quite acceptable to refer to the\n\u201cI\u201d as fictitious in a metaphysical sense.\n\nWhy, then, do we seem to experience what Mead refers to as a\n\u201crunning current of awareness,\u201d that is, an ego that\nappears to be aware of itself as it acts and thinks, if the\n\u201cI\u201d is not immediately aware of itself (SS in SW, 144)?\nWilliam James sought to explain this phenomenon in terms of\nproprioception and the relationship between \u201cparts\u201d of the\nstream of consciousness. (James 1890, 296\u2013307; James 1904,\n169\u2013183; James 1905, 184\u2013194). Mead developed a unique\nexplanation based on the relationship of the \u201cI\u201d to the\n\u201cMe.\u201d As we have seen, the \u201cI\u201d reacts and\ninitiates action, but the actions taken are comprehended, objectified,\nas a \u201cMe.\u201d However, the \u201cMe\u201d is not simply\nconfined to the objectifications of the immediate actions of the\n\u201cI.\u201d The \u201cMe\u201d carries with it internalized\nresponses that serve as a commentary on the \u201cI\u2019s\u201d\nactions. Mead states, \u201cThe action with reference to the others\ncalls out responses in the individual himself\u2014there is then\nanother \u2018me\u2019 criticizing, approving, and suggesting, and\nconsciously planning, i.e., the reflective self\u201d (SS in SW,\n145). The running current of awareness, then, is not due to the\n\u201cI\u201d being immediately aware of itself. It is due to the\nrunning commentary of the \u201cMe\u201d on the actions of the\n\u201cI.\u201d The \u201cMe\u201d follows the \u201cI\u201d so\nclosely in time that it appears as if the \u201cI\u201d is the\nsource of the \u201crunning current of awareness.\u201d\n\nFreud\u2019s super-ego could be conscious or unconscious. One might\nthink of the \u201cMe\u201d as similar to the conscious super-ego in\nthe commentary that it provides, but one would have to be careful not\nto carry this analogy too far. For Mead, the \u201cMe\u201d arises\nin relationship to systems of behaviors, generalized others, and,\ntherefore, is by definition multiple, although the behaviors of\nvarious \u201cMe\u2019s\u201d can overlap. Further, Freud\u2019s\nmodel assumes a determinism that is not inherent in the relationship\nof the \u201cI\u201d to the \u201cMe.\u201d Not only does the\n\u201cI\u201d initiate novel responses, its new behaviors can become\npart of a \u201cMe.\u201d In other words, \u201cMe\u2019s\u201d\nare not static. They are systems that often undergo transformation.\nThis will become more apparent in the next section when we discuss\nMead\u2019s ideas regarding emergence. In this context it is enough\nto suggest the following: when a ballplayer makes a catch in a manner\nthat has never been made before\u2014that is, makes a play that is\nsignificantly different from prior catches\u2014the new play may\nbecome part of the repertoire of the team\u2019s behaviors. In other\nwords, the play may alter the existing generalized other by modifying\nexisting behavioral patterns. In so doing, it gives rise to a modified\nor new self because the game as a whole has been changed. Once again,\nthis may be easier to see in terms of the transformations that take\nplace in families when new reactions occur as children and adults\ninteract over time. New selves are generated as family systems are\ntransformed.\n",
