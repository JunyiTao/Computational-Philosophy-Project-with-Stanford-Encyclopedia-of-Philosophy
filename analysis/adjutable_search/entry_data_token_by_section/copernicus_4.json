    "main_text": "Astronomical Ideas and Writings || Rheticus and the Narratio prima\n2.4 Rheticus and the Narratio prima\n\nAlthough Copernicus received encouragement to publish his book from\nhis close friend, the bishop of Chelmo Tiedemann Giese\n(1480\u20131550), and from the cardinal of Capua Nicholas\nSch\u00f6nberg (1472\u20131537), it was the arrival of Georg Joachim\nRheticus in Frombork that solved his needs for a supportive and\nstimulating colleague in mathematics and astronomy and for access to\nan appropriate printer. Rheticus was a professor of mathematics at the\nUniversity of Wittenberg, a major center for the student of\nmathematics as well as for Lutheran theology. In 1538 Rheticus took a\nleave of absence to visit several famous scholars in the fields of\nastronomy and mathematics. It is not known how Rheticus learned about\nCopernicus\u2019s theory; he may have been convinced to visit\nCopernicus by one of the earlier scholars he had visited, Johann\nSch\u00f6ner, though, as Swerdlow and Neugebauer (16) noted, by\n\u201cthe early 1530\u2019s knowledge of Copernicus\u2019s new\ntheory was circulating in Europe, even reaching the high and learned\ncircles of the Vatican.\u201d Rheticus brought with him some\nmathematical and astronomical volumes, which both provided Copernicus\nwith some important material and showed him the quality of the\nmathematical printing available in the German centers of\n publishing.[10]\n Rheticus\u2019s present of the 1533 edition of Regiomontanus\u2019s\nOn all Kinds of Triangles (De triangulis omnimodis),\nfor example, convinced Copernicus to revise his section on\ntrigonometry. But Rheticus was particularly interested in showing\nCopernicus the work of the Nuremberg publisher Johann Petreius as a\npossible publisher of Copernicus\u2019s volume. Swerdlow and\nNeugebauer (25) plausibly suggested that \u201cPetreius was offering\nto publish Copernicus\u2019s work, if not advertising by this notice\nthat he was already committed to do so.\u201d Rheticus wrote the\nNarratio prima in 1540, an introduction to the theories of\nCopernicus, which was published and circulated. This further\nencouraged Copernicus to publish his Revolutions, which he\nhad been working on since he published the\nCommentariolus.\n\nThe Narratio prima was written in 1539 and took the form of a\nletter to Johann Sch\u00f6ner announcing Copernicus\u2019s findings\nand describing the contents of the Revolutions. He dealt with\nsuch topics as the motions of the fixed stars, the tropical year, the\nobliquity of the ecliptic, the problems resulting from the motion of\nthe sun, the motions of the earth and the other planets, librations,\nlongitude in the other five planets, and the apparent deviation of the\nplanets from the ecliptic. He asserted that the heliocentric universe\nshould have been adopted because it better accounted for such\nphenomena as the precession of the equinoxes and the change in the\nobliquity of the ecliptic; it resulted in a diminution of the\neccentricity of the sun; the sun was the center of the deferents of\nthe planets; it allowed the circles in the universe to revolve\nuniformly and regularly; it satisfied appearances more readily with\nfewer explanations necessary; it united all the spheres into one\nsystem. Rheticus added astrological predictions and number mysticism,\nwhich were absent from Copernicus\u2019s work.\n\nThe Narratio prima was printed in 1540 in Gdansk (then\nDanzig); thus, it was the first printed description of the Copernican\nthesis. Rheticus sent a copy to Achilles Pirmin Gasser of Feldkirch,\nhis hometown in modern-day Austria, and Gasser wrote a foreword that\nwas published with a second edition that was produced in 1541 in\nBasel. It was published again in 1596 as an appendix to the first\nedition of Johannes Kepler\u2019s Mysterium cosmographicum\n(Secret of the Universe), the first completely Copernican work by an\nadherent since the publications by Copernicus and Rheticus.\n",
