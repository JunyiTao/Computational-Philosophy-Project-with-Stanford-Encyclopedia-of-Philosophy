It says that S and\nH are related by the pervasion relation just in case there is\ncollocation of H with S and S is not a\nproperty the absence of which is collocated with H\n(hetusam\u0101n\u0101dhikara\u1e47\u0101tyant\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101pratiyogi-s\u0101dhyas\u0101m\u0101n\u0101dhikara\u1e47yam\nvy\u0101pti\u1e25; TS 50). Almost the same formulation is found\nin other Navya-Ny\u0101ya texts, such as the\nSiddh\u0101nta-mukt\u0101vali. This definition is supposed to\nbe applicable even if the inferred property S is\n\u2018universally positive\u2019. The idea, roughly, is that if\nS pervades H then no property whose absence is\ncollocated with H can be identical to S. If we can\nfind an instance of a locus of smoke which is also a locus of the\nabsence of some property, coldness say, then coldness cannot be\nidentical with fieriness. That is:\n\nPervades (S, H) only if\n(\u2203x)(Hx &\nP\u2032x) \u2192 (P \u2260 S).\n\n\n(There is an implicit quantification over P here). What this\nsays is that there is no place where H is collocated with the\nabsence of S, but it does so without actually using the\npotentially non-referring phrase \u201cabsence of S\u201d, and it\nthereby avoids the problem of universally positive properties.\nHowever, although this condition is necessary for pervasion, it is not\nsufficient, for it is consistent with H (or S) being\nuninstantiated. So Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba insists too that H and\nS must be collocated:\n\n \nPervades (S, H) iff\n  \ni.\n\u2203x (Hx &\n      P\u2032x) \u2192 (P \u2260 S),\n      and\nii.\n\u2203x (Hx & Sx).\n\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s trick implicitly trades on the theorem\n\u201cA \u2192 B \u2261 \u00ac (A &\n\u00ac B)\u201d. Thus clause (i) is virtually equivalent to\nV1. This shows too that we do not yet have a definition\nwhich can deal with the partially locatable properties, for which we\nneed something more like V2. Hence\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s final definition is:\n\nV3\nPervades (S, H) iff\n  \ni.\n\u2203x (Hx &\n      P\u2032x & \u00acPx) \u2192\n      (P \u2260 S), and\nii.\n\u2203x (Hx &\n      Sx).\n\n\n\nThis definition of pervasion is able to handle both universally\npositive properties and partially located properties appearing as\ninferred property.\n\nOne may wonder why it is that, since a pervasion relation is of the\nform \u201call Hs are S\u201d, the Naiy\u0101yikas\ndid not simply use the notion of universal quantification in their\ndefinitions. The answer, perhaps, is that they were in fact trying to\ndefine this notion, and to do so only in terms of certain other\nnotions which they took to be primitive, especially the notion of\nco-location and absence. If this is correct, however, then we must\nshow how to reconstruct the definition without its implicit\nquantification over a property P (cf. Goekoop 1967).\n",
