    "main_text": "Why Public Reason?\n1. Why Public Reason?\n\nThe idea of public reason appears to inhabit a middle ground between\ntwo more familiar standards of evaluation in moral and political\nphilosophy. On the one hand, there is consent. Some political\nphilosophers, for example, argue that political legitimacy requires\nthe actual or implied consent of the governed (Otsuka 2003,\n89\u2013113; Simmons 1999). On the other hand, there is\ntruth: we can simply ask whether any alleged moral or\npolitical principle is true. Public reason does not aim either at\nconsent or truth. Public reason instead requires that our moral or\npolitical principles be justifiable to, or reasonably acceptable to,\nall those persons to whom the principles are meant to apply. An\naccount of public reason must find some way of giving the perspective\nof individual persons a significant role, without allowing this to\ncollapse into consent: public reason is not simply a way of\nidentifying those principles to which people already consent. But\nequally, public reason must not define those principles that could be\njustified to, or be acceptable to, each person as simply those\nprinciples that are true. In either case, the idea of public reason\nwould do no independent work.\n\nThis apparent middle ground between consent and truth may seem\npuzzling in several respects. One puzzle is whether there is, in fact,\na coherent and stable way of explicating the notion of reasonable\nacceptability or justification (Raz 1990, 46; Enoch, 2015). But even\nif we assume the idea of public reason is coherent, we can plausibly\nask why we ought to accept this idea, that is, what is the basis for\nadopting public reason as the relevant standard to evaluate rules and\nto govern individual conduct? This section considers five different\nanswers to this question (these answers can, of course, also be\ncombined). It is helpful to begin by considering these different\npositions regarding the basis of public reason, since how one chooses\nto answer this question often has direct implications for the scope,\nconstituency, content, site, duties, and structure of public reason\n(see Billingham and Taylor 2020).\n\nEach of the positions below is usually combined with an assumption\nabout pluralism or reasonable disagreement over a wide range of moral,\nethical, and other philosophical matters. That is, virtually all\nproponents of public reason assume that there is deep and intractable\ndisagreement amongst some people, and this disagreement is not simply\nthe result of irrationality, prejudice, or self-interest, but rather\narises as a result of the normal functioning of human reasoning under\nreasonably favorable conditions. This assumption about pluralism or\ndisagreement is an essential part of the rationale for public reason\nsince without it, it is difficult to understand why our moral or\npolitical principles ought to be justifiable or acceptable to others,\nas opposed to simply true or correct. The most influential conception\nof such pluralism or disagreement is Rawls\u2019s account of the\nburdens of judgment and the subsequent fact of reasonable\npluralism (Rawls 1996, 36\u201337, 55\u201357), though this\naccount is controversial, and has been subject to extensive criticism\n(e.g. Galston 2002, 46\u201347; Gaus 1996, 131\u2013136; Wenar 1995,\n41\u201348).\n",
