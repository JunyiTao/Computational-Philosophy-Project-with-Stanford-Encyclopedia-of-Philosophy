The Status of Collapse Models and Recent Positions about them\n\nWe recall that, as stated in Section 3, the macro-objectification\nproblem has been at the centre of the most lively and most challenging\ndebate originated by the quantum view of natural processes. According\nto the majority of those who adhere to the orthodox position such a\nproblem does not deserve a particular attention: classical concepts\nare a logical prerequisite for the very formulation of quantum\nmechanics and, consequently, the measurement process itself, the\ndividing line between the quantum and the classical world, cannot and\nmust not be investigated, but simply accepted. This position has been\nlucidly summarized by J. Bell himself:\n\n\nMaking a virtue of necessity and influenced by positivistic and\ninstrumentalist philosophies, many came to hold not only that it is\ndifficult to find a coherent picture but that it is wrong to look for\none\u2014if not actually immoral then certainly unprofessional.\n(1981: 45)\n\n\nThe situation has seen many changes in the course of time, and the\nnecessity of making a clear distinction between what is quantum and\nwhat is classical has given rise to many proposals for \u2018easy\nsolutions\u2019 to the problem which are based on the possibility,\nfor all practical purposes (FAPP), of locating the splitting\nbetween these two faces of reality at different levels.\n\nThen came Bohmian mechanics, a theory which has made clear, in a lucid\nand perfectly consistent way, that there is no reason of principle to\nrequire a dichotomic description of the world. A universal dynamical\nprinciple runs all physical processes and even though \u2018it\ncompletely agrees with standard quantum predictions\u2019, it\naccounts for the standard wave-packet reduction in micro-macro\ninteractions as well as the classical behaviour of macroscopic\nobjects.\n\nAs we have mentioned, the other consistent proposal, at the\nnonrelativistic level, of a conceptually satisfactory solution of the\nmacro-objectification problem is represented by the Collapse Theories\nwhich are the subject of these pages. Contrary to Bohmian mechanics,\nthey are rival to quantum mechanics, since they make different\npredictions (even though quite difficult to put into evidence)\nconcerning various physical processes.\n\nA common criticism makes reference to the fact that within any\ncollapse model the ensuing dynamics for the statistical operator can\nbe considered as the reduced dynamics deriving from a unitary (and,\nconsequently, essentially a standard quantum) dynamics for the states\nof an enlarged Hilbert space of a composite quantum system \\(S+E\\)\ninvolving, besides the physical system \\(S\\) of interest, an ancilla\n\\(E\\) whose degrees of freedom are completely unaccessible. Due to the\nquantum dynamical semigroup nature of the evolution equation for the\nstatistical operator, any GRW-like model can always be seen as a\nphenomenological model deriving from a standard quantum evolution on a\nlarger Hilbert space. In this way, the unitary deterministic evolution\ncharacterizing quantum mechanics would be fully restored.\n\nApart from the obvious remark that such a critical attitude completely\nfails to grasp the most important feature of collapse theories, i.e.,\nof dealing with individual quantum systems and not with statistical\nensembles and of yielding a perfectly satisfactory description,\nmatching our perceptions concerning individual macroscopic\nsystems, invoking an unaccessible ancilla to account for the\nnonlinear and stochastic character of GRW-type theories is once more a\npurely verbal way of avoiding facing the real puzzling aspects of the\nquantum description of macroscopic systems. \n\nOther reasons for ignoring the dynamical reduction program have been\nput forward within the quantum information community. We will not\nspend too much time in analyzing and discussing the new position about\nthe foundational issues which have motivated the elaboration of\ncollapse theories. The crucial fact is that, from this perspective,\none takes the theory not to be about something real \u2018occurring\nout there\u2019 in a real word, but simply about information. This\npoint is made extremely explicit by Zeilinger (2002: 252):\n\n\ninformation is the most basic notion of quantum mechanics, and it is\ninformation about possible measurement results that is represented in\nthe quantum state. Measurement results are nothing more than states of\nthe classical apparatus used by the experimentalist. The quantum\nsystem then is nothing other than the consistently constructed\nreferent of the information represented in the quantum state.\n\n\n\nIt is clear that if one takes such a position almost all motivations\nto be worried by the measurement problem disappear, and with them the\nreasons to work out what Bell has denoted as \u2018an exact version\nof quantum mechanics\u2019. The most appropriate reply to this type\nof criticisms is to recall that J. Bell (1990) has included\n\u2018information\u2019 among the words which must have no place in\na formulation with any pretension to physical precision. In particular\nhe has stressed that one cannot even mention information unless one\nhas given a precise answer to the two following questions: Whose\ninformation? and Information about what?\n\nA much more serious attitude is to call attention, as many serious\nauthors do, to the fact that since collapse theories represent rival\ntheories with respect to standard quantum mechanics they lead to the\nidentification of experimental situations which would allow, in\nprinciple, crucial tests to discriminate between the two. As we have\ndiscussed above, presently, fully discriminating tests are not out of\nreach.\n",
