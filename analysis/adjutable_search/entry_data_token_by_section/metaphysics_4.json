    "main_text": "The Problems of Metaphysics: the \u201cNew\u201d Metaphysics || Modality\n3.1 Modality\n\nPhilosophers have long recognized that there is an important\ndistinction within the class of true propositions: the distinction\nbetween those propositions that might have been false and those that\ncould not have been false (those that must be true). Compare, for\nexample, the proposition that Paris is the capital of France and the\nproposition that there is a prime between every number greater than 1\nand its double. Both are true, but the former could have been false\nand the latter could not have been false. Likewise, there is a\ndistinction to be made within the class of false propositions: between\nthose that could have been true and those that could not have been\ntrue (those that had to be false).\n\nSome Medieval philosophers supposed that the fact that true\npropositions are of the two sorts \u201cnecessarily true\u201d and\n\u201ccontingently true\u201d (and the corresponding fact about\nfalse propositions) showed that there were two \u201cmodes\u201d in\nwhich a proposition could be true (or false): the mode of contingency\nand the mode of necessity\u2014hence the term \u2018modality\u2019.\nPresent-day philosophers retain the Medieval term\n\u2018modality\u2019 but now it means no more than \u201cpertaining\nto possibility and necessity\u201d. The types of modality of interest\nto metaphysicians fall into two camps: modality de re and\nmodality de dicto.\n\nModality de dicto is the modality of propositions\n(\u2018dictum\u2019 means proposition, or close enough). If\nmodality were coextensive with modality de dicto, it would be\nat least a defensible position that the topic of modality belongs to\nlogic rather than to metaphysics. (Indeed, the study of modal logics\ngoes back to Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics.)\n\nBut many philosophers also think there is a second kind of modality,\nmodality de re\u2014the modality of things. (The modality of\nsubstances, certainly, and perhaps of things in other ontological\ncategories.) The status of modality de re is undeniably a\nmetaphysical topic, and we assign it to the \u201cnew\u201d\nmetaphysics because, although one can ask modal questions about things\nthat do not change\u2014God, for example, or universals\u2014a large\nproportion of the work that has been done in this area concerns the\nmodal features of changing things.\n\nThere are two types of modality de re. The first concerns the\nexistence of things\u2014of human beings, for example. If Sally, an\nordinary human being, says, \u201cI might not have existed\u201d,\nalmost everyone will take her to have stated an obvious truth. And if\nwhat she has said is indeed true, then she exists contingently. That\nis to say, she is a contingent being: a being who might not have\nexisted. A necessary being, in contrast, is a being of which it is\nfalse that it might not have existed. Whether any objects are\nnecessary beings is an important question of modal metaphysics. Some\nphilosophers have gone so far to maintain that all objects are\nnecessary beings, since necessary existence is a truth of logic in\nwhat seems to them to be the best quantified modal logic. (See Barcan\n1946 for the first modern connection between necessary existence and\nquantified modal logic. Barcan did not draw any metaphysical\nconclusions from her logical results, but later authors, especially\nWilliamson 2013 have.)\n\nThe second kind of modality de re concerns the properties of\nthings. Like the existence of things, the possession of properties by\nthings is subject to modal qualification. If Sally, who speaks\nEnglish, says, \u201cI might have spoken only French\u201d, almost\neveryone will take that statement to be no less obviously true than\nher statement that she might not have existed. And if what she has\nsaid is indeed true, then \u201cspeaking English\u201d is a property\nthat she has only contingently or (the more usual word) only\naccidentally. Additionally there may be properties which some objects\nhave essentially. A thing has a property essentially if it could not\nexist without having that property. Examples of essential properties\ntend to be controversial, largely because the most plausible examples\nof a certain object\u2019s possessing a property essentially are only\nas plausible as the thesis that that object possesses those properties\nat all. For example, if Sally is a physical object, as physicalists\nsuppose, then it is very plausible for them to suppose further that\nshe is essentially a physical object\u2014but it is controversial\nwhether they are right to suppose that she is a physical object. And,\nof course, the same thing can be said, mutatis mutandis,\nconcerning dualists and the property of being a non-physical object.\nIt would seem, however, that Sally is either essentially a physical\nobject or essentially a non-physical object. And many find it\nplausible to suppose that (whether she is physical or non-physical)\nshe has the property \u201cnot being a poached egg\u201d\nessentially.\n\nThe most able and influential enemy of modality (both de\ndicto and de re) was W. V. Quine, who vigorously\ndefended both the following theses. First, that modality de\ndicto can be understood only in terms of the concept of\nanalyticity (a problematical concept in his view). Secondly, that\nmodality de re cannot be understood in terms of analyticity\nand therefore cannot be understood at all. Quine argued for this\nlatter claim by proposing what he took to be decisive counterexamples\nto theories that take essentiality to be meaningful. If modality\nde re makes any sense, Quine contended (1960: 199\u2013200),\ncyclists must be regarded as essentially bipedal\u2014for\n\u201cCyclists are bipedal\u201d would be regarded as an analytic\nsentence by those who believe in analyticity. But mathematicians are\nonly accidentally bipedal (\u201cMathematicians are bipedal\u201d is\nnot analytic by anyone\u2019s lights). What then, Quine proceeded to\nask, of someone who is both a mathematician and a cyclist?\u2014that\nperson seems both essentially and only accidentally bi-pedal. Since\nthis is incoherent, Quine thought that modality de re is\nincoherent.\n\nMost philosophers are now convinced, however, that Quine\u2019s\n\u201cmathematical cyclist\u201d argument has been adequately\nanswered by Saul Kripke (1972), Alvin Plantinga (1974) and various\nother defenders of modality de re. Kripke and\nPlantinga\u2019s defenses of modality are paradigmatically\nmetaphysical (except insofar as they directly address Quine\u2019s\nlinguistic argument). Both make extensive use of the concept of a\npossible world in defending the intelligibility of modality (both\nde re and de dicto). Leibniz was the first\nphilosopher to use \u2018possible world\u2019 as a philosophical\nterm of art, but Kripke\u2019s and Plantinga\u2019s use of the\nphrase is different from his. For Leibniz, a possible world was a\npossible creation: God\u2019s act of creation consists in his\nchoosing one possible world among many to be the one world that he\ncreates\u2014the \u201cactual\u201d world. For Kripke and\nPlantinga, however, a possible world is a possible \u201cwhole of\nreality\u201d. For Leibniz, God and his actions \u201cstand\noutside\u201d all possible worlds. For Kripke and Plantinga, no\nbeing, not even God, could stand outside the whole system of possible\nworlds. A Kripke-Plantinga (KP) world is an abstract object of some\nsort. Let us suppose that a KP world is a possible state of affairs\n(this is Plantinga\u2019s idea; Kripke says nothing so definite).\nConsider any given state of affairs; let us say, Paris being the\ncapital of France. This state of affairs obtains, since Paris\nis the capital of France. By contrast, the state of affairs\nTours being the capital of France does not obtain. The latter\nstate of affairs does, however, exist, for there is such a state of\naffairs. (Obtaining thus stands to states of affairs as truth stands\nto propositions: although the proposition that Tours is the capital of\nFrance is not true, there nevertheless is such a proposition.) The\nstate of affairs x is said to include the state of affairs\ny if it is impossible for x to obtain and y\nnot to obtain. If it is impossible for both x and y\nto obtain, then each precludes the other. A possible world is simply a\npossible state of affairs that, for every state of affairs x,\neither includes or precludes x; the actual world is the one\nsuch state of affairs that obtains.\n\nUsing the KP theory we can answer Quine\u2019s challenge as follows.\nIn every possible world, every cyclist in that world is bipedal in\nthat world. (Assuming with Quine that necessarily cyclists are\nbipedal. Apparently he had not foreseen adaptive bicycles.)\nNevertheless for any particular cyclist, there is some possible world\nwhere he (the same person) is not bipedal. Once we draw this\ndistinction, we can see that Quine\u2019s argument is invalid. More\ngenerally, on the KP theory, theses about de re essential\nproperties need not be analytic; they are meaningful because they\nexpress claims about an object\u2019s properties in various possible\nworlds.\n\nWe can also use the notion of possible worlds to define many other\nmodal concepts. For example, a necessarily true proposition is a\nproposition that would be true no matter what possible world was\nactual. Socrates is a contingent being if there is some possible world\nsuch that he would not exist if that world were actual, and he has the\nproperty \u201cbeing human\u201d essentially if every possible world\nthat includes his existence also includes his being human. Kripke and\nPlantinga have greatly increased the clarity of modal discourse (and\nparticularly of modal discourse de re), but at the expense of\nintroducing a modal ontology, an ontology of possible worlds.\n\nTheirs is not the only modal ontology on offer. The main alternative\nto the KP theory has been the \u2018modal realism\u2019 championed\nby David Lewis (1986). Lewis\u2019s modal ontology appeals to objects\ncalled possible worlds, but these \u201cworlds\u201d are concrete\nobjects. What we call the actual world is one of these concrete\nobjects, the spatiotemporally connected universe we inhabit. What we\ncall \u201cnon-actual\u201d worlds are other concrete universes that\nare spatiotemporally isolated from ours (and from each other). There\nis, Lewis contends, a vast array of non-actual worlds, an array that\ncontains at least those worlds that are generated by an ingenious\nprinciple of recombination, a principle that can be stated without the\nuse of modal language (1986: 87). For Lewis, moreover,\n\u201cactual\u201d is an indexical term: when I speak of the actual\nworld, I refer to the world of which I am an inhabitant\u2014and so\nfor any speaker who is \u201cin\u201d (who is a part of) any\nworld.\n\nIn the matter of modality de dicto, Lewis\u2019s theory\nproceeds in a manner that is at least parallel to the KP theory: there\ncould be flying pigs if there are flying pigs in some possible world\n(if some world has flying pigs as parts). But the case is otherwise\nwith modality de re. Since every ordinary object is in only\none of the concrete worlds, Lewis must either say that each such\nobject has all its properties essentially or else adopt a treatment of\nmodality de re that is not parallel to the KP treatment. He\nchooses the latter alternative. Although Socrates is in only the\nactual world, Lewis holds, he has \u2018counterparts\u2019 in some\nother worlds, objects that play the role in those worlds that he plays\nin this world. If all Socrates\u2019 counterparts are human, then we\nmay say that he is essentially human. If one of Hubert\nHumphrey\u2019s counterparts won (the counterpart of) the 1968\npresidential election, it is correct to say of Humphrey that he could\nhave won that election.\n\nIn addition to the obvious stark ontological contrast between the two\ntheories, they differ in two important ways in their implications for\nthe philosophy of modality. First, if Lewis is right, then modal\nconcepts can be defined in terms of paradigmatically non-modal\nconcepts, since \u2018world\u2019 and all of Lewis\u2019s other\ntechnical terms can be defined using only \u2018is spatiotemporally\nrelated to\u2019, \u2018is a part of\u2019 and the vocabulary of\nset theory. For Kripke and Plantinga, however, modal concepts are\nsui generis, indefinable or having only definitions that\nappeal to other modal concepts. Secondly, Lewis\u2019s theory implies\na kind of anti-realism concerning modality de re. This is\nbecause there is no one relation that is the counterpart\nrelation\u2014there are rather various ways or respects in which one\ncould say that objects in two worlds \u201cplay the same role\u201d\nin their respective worlds. Socrates, therefore, may well have\nnon-human counterparts under one counterpart relation and no non-human\ncounterparts under another. And the choice of a counterpart relation\nis a pragmatic or interest-relative choice. But on the KP theory, it\nis an entirely objective question whether Socrates fails to be human\nin some world in which he exists: the answer must be Yes or No and is\nindependent of human choices and interests.\n\nWhatever one may think of these theories when one considers them in\ntheir own right (as theories of modality, as theories with various\nperhaps objectionable ontological commitments), one must concede that\nthey are paradigmatically metaphysical theories. They bear witness to\nthe resurgence of metaphysics in analytical philosophy in the last\nthird of the twentieth century.\n",
