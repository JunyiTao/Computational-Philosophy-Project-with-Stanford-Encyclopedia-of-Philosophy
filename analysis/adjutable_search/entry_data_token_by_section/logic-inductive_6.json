    "main_text": "The Application of Inductive Probabilities to the Evaluation of Scientific Hypotheses || Likelihoods\n3.1 Likelihoods\n\nIn probabilistic inductive logic the likelihoods carry the\nempirical import of hypotheses. A likelihood is a support\nfunction probability of form \\(P[e \\pmid h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c]\\). It\nexpresses how likely it is that outcome \\(e\\) will occur according\nto hypothesis \\(h_i\\) together with the background and auxiliaries \\(b\\) and the experimental (or observational) conditions \\(c\\).[5]\n If a hypothesis together with auxiliaries and experimental/observation conditions\ndeductively entails an evidence claim, the axioms of probability make\nthe corresponding likelihood objective in the sense that every support\nfunction must agree on its values: \\(P[e \\pmid h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c] =\n1\\) if \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c \\vDash e\\); \\(P[e \\pmid h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c]\n= 0\\) if \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c \\vDash{\\nsim}e\\). However, in many cases\na hypothesis \\(h_i\\) will not be deductively related to the evidence,\nbut will only imply it probabilistically. There are several ways this\nmight happen: (1) hypothesis \\(h_i\\) may itself be an explicitly\nprobabilistic or statistical hypothesis; (2) an auxiliary statistical\nhypothesis, as part of the background b, may connect hypothesis\n\\(h_i\\) to the evidence; (3) the connection between the hypothesis and\nthe evidence may be somewhat loose or imprecise, not mediated by\nexplicit statistical claims, but nevertheless objective enough for the\npurposes of evidential evaluation. Let\u2019s briefly consider\nexamples of the first two kinds. We\u2019ll treat case (3) in\n Section 5,\n which addresses the the issue of vague and imprecise likelihoods.\n\nThe hypotheses being tested may themselves be statistical in nature.\nOne of the simplest examples of statistical hypotheses and their role\nin likelihoods are hypotheses about the chance characteristic of\ncoin-tossing. Let \\(h_{[r]}\\)\nbe a hypothesis that says a specific coin has a propensity (or\nobjective chance) r for coming up heads on normal tosses, let \\(b\\) say that such tosses are probabilistically independent of one another. Let \\(c\\)\nstate that the coin is tossed n times in the normal way; and\nlet \\(e\\) say that on these tosses the coin comes up heads m\ntimes. In cases like this the value of the likelihood of the outcome\n\\(e\\) on hypothesis \\(h_{[r]}\\)\nfor condition \\(c\\) is given by the well-known binomial formula:  \n\n\\[\nP[e \\pmid  h_{[r]}\\cdot b\\cdot c] =\n\\frac{n!}{m! \\times(n-m)!}\n\\times r^m (1-r)^{n-m}.\n\\]\n\n\nThere are, of course, more complex cases of likelihoods involving\nstatistical hypotheses. Consider, for example, the hypothesis that\nplutonium 233 nuclei have a half-life of 20 minutes\u2014i.e., that\nthe propensity (or objective chance) for a Pu-233 nucleus to\ndecay within a 20 minute period is 1/2. The full statistical model for\nthe lifetime of such a system says that the propensity (or\nobjective chance) for that system to remain intact (i.e., to\nnot decay) within any time period x is governed by the\nformula \\(1/2^{x/\\tau}\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is the half-life of such a\nsystem. Let \\(h\\) be a hypothesis that says that this statistical\nmodel applies to Pu-233 nuclei with \\(\\tau = 20\\) minutes; let\n\\(c\\) say that some specific Pu-233 nucleus is intact within a decay detector (of some specific kind) at an initial time \\(t_0\\); let \\(e\\) say that no decay of this same Pu-233 nucleus is detected by the later time \\(t\\); and let \\(b\\) say that the detector is completely accurate (it always registers a real decay, and it never registers false-positive detections).  Then, the associated likelihood of\n\\(e\\) given \\(h\\) and \\(c\\) is this: \\(P[e \\pmid h\\cdot b\\cdot c] =\n1/2^{(t - t_0)/\\tau}\\), where the value of \\(\\tau\\) is 20 minutes.\n\nAn auxiliary statistical hypothesis, as part of the background\n\\(b\\), may be required to connect hypothesis \\(h_i\\) to the evidence. For example,\na blood test for HIV has a known false-positive rate and a known\ntrue-positive rate. Suppose the false-positive rate is .05\u2014i.e.,\nthe test tends to incorrectly show the blood sample to be positive for\nHIV in 5% of all cases where HIV is not present. And suppose that the\ntrue-positive rate is .99\u2014i.e., the test tends to correctly show\nthe blood sample to be positive for HIV in 99% of all cases where HIV\nreally is present. When a particular patient\u2019s blood is tested, the hypotheses under consideration are this patient is infected with HIV, \\(h\\), and this patient is not infected with HIV, \\({\\nsim}h\\). In this context the known test characteristics function as background information, b. The\nexperimental condition \\(c\\) merely states that this particular\npatient was subjected to this specific kind of blood test for HIV,\nwhich was processed by the lab using proper procedures. Let us suppose\nthat the outcome \\(e\\) states that the result is a positive test\nresult for HIV. The relevant likelihoods then, are \\(P[e \\pmid h\\cdot\nb\\cdot c] = .99\\) and \\(P[e \\pmid {\\nsim}h\\cdot b\\cdot c]\\) = .05.\n\n\nIn this example the values of the likelihoods are entirely due to the\nstatistical characteristics of the accuracy of the test, which is\ncarried by the background/auxiliary information \\(b\\). The hypothesis\n\\(h\\) being tested by the evidence is not itself statistical.\n\nThis kind of situation may, of course, arise for much more complex\nhypotheses. The alternative hypotheses of interest may be deterministic\nphysical theories, say Newtonian Gravitation Theory and some specific alternatives. \nSome of the experiments that test this theory relay on somewhat imprecise\nmeasurements that have known statistical error characteristics, which\nare expressed as part of the background or auxiliary hypotheses,\n\\(b\\). For example, the auxiliary \\(b\\) may describe the error\ncharacteristics of a device that measures the torque imparted to a\nquartz fiber, where the measured torque is used to assess the strength\nof the gravitational force between test masses. In that case \\(b\\)\nmay say that for this kind of device the measurement errors are\nnormally distributed about whatever value a given gravitational theory\npredicts, with some specified standard deviation that is\ncharacteristic of the device. This results in specific values \\(r_i\\)\nfor the likelihoods, \\(P[e \\pmid h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c] = r_i\\), for each\nof the various gravitational theories, \\(h_i\\), being\ntested.\n\nLikelihoods that arise from explicit statistical claims\u2014either\nwithin the hypotheses being tested, or from explicit statistical\nbackground claims that tie the hypotheses to the evidence\u2014are\noften called direct inference likelihoods. Such likelihoods\nshould be completely objective. So, all evidential support functions should agree on their values, just as all support functions agree on likelihoods when evidence is logically\nentailed. Direct inference likelihoods are logical in an\nextended, non-deductive sense. Indeed, some logicians have attempted\nto spell out the logic of direct inferences in terms of the\nlogical form of the sentences\n involved.[6]\n But regardless of whether that project succeeds, it seems reasonable\nto take likelihoods of this sort to have highly objective or\nintersubjectively agreed values.\n\nNot all likelihoods of interest in confirmational contexts are\nwarranted deductively or by explicitly stated statistical claims. In\nsuch cases the likelihoods may have vague, imprecise values, but\nvalues that are determinate enough to still underwrite an objective\nevaluation of hypotheses on the evidence. In\n Section 5\n we\u2019ll consider such cases, where no underlying statistical\ntheory is involved, but where likelihoods are determinate enough to\nplay their standard role in the evidential evaluation of scientific\nhypotheses. However, the proper treatment of such cases will be more\neasily understood after we have first seen how the logic works when\nlikelihoods are precisely known (such as cases where the likelihood\nvalues are endorsed by explicit statistical hypotheses and/or explicit\nstatistical auxiliaries). In any case, the likelihoods that relate\nhypotheses to evidence claims in many scientific contexts will have\nsuch objective values. So, although a variety of different support\nfunctions \\(P_{\\alpha}\\), \\(P_{\\beta}\\),\u2026, \\(P_{\\gamma}\\),\netc., may be needed to represent the differing \u201cinductive\nproclivities\u201d of the various members of a scientific community,\nfor now we will consider cases where all evidential support functions\nagree on the values of the likelihoods. For,\nthe likelihoods represent the empirical content of a scientific hypothesis, what\nthe hypothesis (together with experimental conditions, \\(c\\), and background and auxiliaries \\(b\\))\nsays or probabilistically implies about the\nevidence. Thus, the empirical objectivity of a science relies on a\nhigh degree of objectivity or intersubjective agreement among\nscientists on the numerical values of likelihoods.\n\nTo see the point more vividly, imagine what a science would be like if\nscientists disagreed widely about the values of likelihoods. Each\npractitioner interprets a theory to say quite different\nthings about how likely it is that various possible evidence\nstatements will turn out to be true. Whereas scientist \\(\\alpha\\)\ntakes theory \\(h_1\\) to probabilistically imply that event \\(e\\) is\nhighly likely, his colleague \\(\\beta\\) understands the empirical\nimport of \\(h_1\\) to say that \\(e\\) is very unlikely. And,\nconversely, \\(\\alpha\\) takes competing theory \\(h_2\\) to\nprobabilistically imply that \\(e\\) is very unlikely, whereas\n\\(\\beta\\) reads \\(h_2\\) to say that \\(e\\) is extremely likely. So,\nfor \\(\\alpha\\) the evidential outcome \\(e\\) supplies strong support\nfor \\(h_1\\) over \\(h_2\\), because  \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[e \\pmid  h_1\\cdot b\\cdot c]  \\gg P_{\\alpha}[e \\pmid  h_2\\cdot b\\cdot c].\\]\n\n\nBut his colleague \\(\\beta\\) takes outcome \\(e\\) to show just the\nopposite, that \\(h_2\\) is strongly supported over \\(h_1\\), because\n\n \\[P_{\\beta}[e \\pmid  h_2\\cdot b\\cdot c] \\gg  P_{\\beta}[e \\pmid  h_1\\cdot b\\cdot c].\\]\n\n\nIf this kind of situation were to occur often, or for significant evidence\nclaims in a scientific domain, it would make a shambles of the\nempirical objectivity of that science. It would completely undermine\nthe empirical testability of such hypotheses and theories within that\nscientific domain. Under these circumstances, although each scientist\nemploys the same sentences to express a given theory\n\\(h_i\\), each understands the empirical import of these\nsentences so differently that \\(h_i\\) as understood by\n\\(\\alpha\\) is an empirically different theory than \\(h_i\\) as\nunderstood by \\(\\beta\\). (Indeed, arguably, \\(\\alpha\\) must take\nat least one of the two sentences, \\(h_1\\) or \\(h_2\\), to express a different proposition than does \\(\\beta\\).) Thus, the empirical\nobjectivity of the sciences requires that experts should be in close\nagreement about the values of the likelihoods.[7]\n\n\nFor now we will suppose that the likelihoods have objective or\nintersubjectively agreed values, common to all agents in a scientific\ncommunity. We mark this agreement by dropping the subscript\n\u2018\\(\\alpha\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(\\beta\\)\u2019, etc., from\nexpressions that represent likelihoods, since all support functions\nunder consideration are supposed to agree on the values for\nlikelihoods. One might worry that this supposition is overly strong.\nThere are legitimate scientific contexts where, although scientists\nshould have enough of a common understanding of the empirical import\nof hypotheses to assign quite similar values to likelihoods, precise\nagreement on their numerical values may be unrealistic. This point is\nright in some important kinds of cases. So later, in Section 5, we will see how to relax the supposition that precise\nlikelihood values are available, and see how the logic works in such\ncases. But for now the main ideas underlying probabilistic inductive\nlogic will be more easily explained if we focus on those contexts were\nobjective or intersubjectively agreed likelihoods are available. Later\nwe will see that much the same logic continues to apply in contexts\nwhere the values of likelihoods may be somewhat vague, or where\nmembers of the scientific community disagree to some extent about\ntheir values.\n\nAn adequate treatment of the likelihoods calls for the introduction of\none additional notational device. Scientific hypotheses are generally\ntested by a sequence of experiments or observations conducted over a\nperiod of time. To explicitly represent the accumulation of evidence,\nlet the series of sentences \\(c_1\\), \\(c_2\\), \u2026, \\(c_n\\),\ndescribe the conditions under which a sequence of experiments or\nobservations are conducted. And let the corresponding outcomes of\nthese observations be represented by sentences \\(e_1\\), \\(e_2\\),\n\u2026, \\(e_n\\). We will abbreviate the conjunction of the first\nn descriptions of experimental or observational conditions by\n\u2018\\(c^n\\)\u2019, and abbreviate the conjunction of descriptions\nof their outcomes by \u2018\\(e^n\\)\u2019. Then, for a stream of\nn observations or experiments and their outcomes, the\nlikelihoods take form \\(P[e^n \\pmid h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}] = r\\),\nfor appropriate values of \\(r\\). In many cases the likelihood\nof the evidence stream will be equal to the product of the likelihoods\nof the individual outcomes: \n\n\\[\nP[e^n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}] = P[e_1 \\pmid  h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c_1] \\times \\cdots \\times P[e_n \\pmid  h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c_{n}].\n\\]\n\n\nWhen this equality holds, the individual bits of evidence are said to\nbe probabilistically independent on the hypothesis (together with\nauxiliaries). In the following account of the logic of evidential\nsupport, such probabilistic independence will not be assumed,\nexcept in those places where it is explicitly invoked.\n",
