    "main_text": "The Theory of Information Channels\n3. The Theory of Information Channels\n\nThe theory of information channels, channel theory, emerged\nfrom\n situation semantics\n (see the entry), with the latter being motivated by the observation\nthat meaning depends on systematic regularities in the world, and that\nsuch regularities are a necessary condition on our grasping any\nmeanings at all (Barwise 1993). Jon Barwise and John Perry (1983)\nappealed to this observation in order to justify and motivate a\nnaturalistic theory of meaning. Early work in situation theory\nconcentrated on situations themselves, thought of best as partial\nworlds in modal parlance. Importantly, situation theory itself\ndealt with the formal side of things in terms of set theory as opposed\nto modally, although as we will see below, modal interpretations have\ncome to dominate.\n\nSituation theory focused on constraints early on, with\nconstraints thought of most usefully as conditionals.\nSituation theory builds its semantic theory on an Austinian theory of\ntruth\u2014where an utterance \\(u_s\\) of a declarative sentence \\(s\\)\nis putting forward a claim that is about some type of\nsituation \\(x\\), such that \\(x\\) is of\nsome type \\(\\phi\\) (Barwise 1993: 4). Austin (1950) calls the type\n\\(\\phi\\) the descriptive content of \\(s,\\) with \\(\\phi\\) specifying\nthe type of situation (or event or thing etc.) in the world that is\nbeing described. He calls the situation \\(x\\) itself\nthe demonstrative content of \\(s\\). In other\nwords, \\(\\phi\\) describes the content of \\(s\\), and \\(x\\)\nis the content demonstrated by \\(s\\)\u2014which\nis just to say that it is the part of the\nworld about which the utterer of \\(u_s\\) is speaking when they utter\n\\(s\\).\n\nAccording to Barwise, for any conditional statement if \\(s_1\\)\nthen \\(s_2\\), such that the descriptive content of \\(s_1\\) is of\ntype \\(\\phi\\), and the descriptive content of \\(s_2\\) is of type\n\\(\\psi\\), the descriptive content of if \\(s_1\\) then \\(s_2\\)\nis the constraint \\(\\phi\\to\\psi\\). Constraints are connections between\ntypes. The demonstrative content of if \\(s_1\\) then\n\\(s_2\\) will be a connection between the demonstrative contents\nof \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\). Supposing that \\(x\\) is the\ndemonstrative content of \\(\\phi\\), and \\(y\\) is the\ndemonstrative content of \\(\\psi\\), the demonstrative content of if\n\\(s_1\\) then \\(s_2\\) will be a connection between \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), with this connection being\nan information channel \\(c\\) between \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), written \\(x\\cmapsto y\\). As\nBarwise puts it succinctly:\n\n\nBy an information channel, let us mean one of these relations\nbetween situations, since it is these relations which allow\ninformation about one situation to be gleaned from another situation.\n(1993: 5)\n\n\nThe proposal in sum is that when we express a constraint\n\\(\\phi\\to\\psi\\) by way of uttering if \\(s_1\\) then \\(s_2\\),\nwe are making a claim to the effect that there is an information\nchannel supporting the constraint. For an information channel to\nsupport a constraint, Barwise\u2019 proposal is the following:\n\\[\\text{If }x\\vDash\\phi, \\:x\\cmapsto y,\\text{ and } \\phi\\to\\psi, \\text{ then } y\\vDash \\psi\\]\n\n(11)\n states that if information of type \\(\\phi\\) is true at the situation\n\\(x\\), and there is an information channel \\(c\\)\nfrom the situation \\(x\\) to the\nsituation \\(y\\), and there is a constraint from\ninformation of type \\(\\phi\\) to information of type \\(\\psi\\), then\ninformation of type \\(\\psi\\) is true at the situation \\(y\\).\n\nBarwise refines the notion of a situation to that of\n\u201csite\u201d\u2014a structured object that contains\ninformation. We now have sites \\(x,\\) \\(y,\\) \\(z,\\)\u2026 and types\n\\(\\phi,\\) \\(\\psi,\\)\u2026, where \\(x:\\phi\\) is read as the\ninformation site \\(x\\) is of type \\(\\phi\\). With\nthe qualification that the channels may or may not be among the sites,\nand that \\(x\\cmapsto y\\) is a three-place (ternary) relation between\ninformation sites and channels. Barwise formulates the Soundness\nAxiom for channel theory as follows:\n\\[c: \\phi\\to\\psi \\text{ iff } \\text{ for all sites } x, y, \\text{ if } x\\cmapsto y\\text{ and } x:\\phi, \\text{ then } y:\\psi.\\]\n\nAt this stage, things are starting to look decidedly modal in\nspirit, if not in practice.\n\nBarwise and Perry\u2019s situations and Austin\u2019s\ndemonstrative contents, are simply partial worlds under a\ndifferent name. That is, they are incomplete possible worlds.\nAustin\u2019s types, the descriptive contents of statements,\nare looking very much like propositions\u2014in particular the\nproposition that describes the claim being made by an utterance. With\na little bit of license, we might think of Austin\u2019s\ndemonstrative content of a statement as that statement\u2019s\ntruthmaker in a fine-grained sense. Barwise\u2019 notation\nin\n  (11)\n above with respect to \\(x\\vDash\\phi\\) betrays this reading. Moreover,\ngiven that \\(x\\cmapsto y\\) is a ternary relation,\n (12)\n is starting to look very much like a semantic clause for the\nconditional that turns on a three-place accessibility relation in\nsomething like a Kripke frame.\n\nThe semantics from Routley et al.\u2019s (1982) relevance logic\ngives the evaluation conditions on a three-place accessibility\nrelation, where the notion of an accessibility relation is familiar\nfrom their role in Kripke frames, used to specify the semantics of\nmodal logic. Barwise notes the connection explicitly:\n\n\nThe work presented here work also suggests a way to think about the\nthree-place accessibility relation semantics for relevance logic of\nRoutley and Meyer. (I have discussed this with both Gabbay and Dunn\noff and on over the past year. More recently, Greg Restall has\nobserved this connection, and has begun to work out the connection in\nsome detail.) (1993: 26)\n\n\nRestall (1996) along with Mares (1996) work out this connection as\nfollows. Restall assumes that channels are amongst the\ninformation sites (Mares does not). Instead of information\nsites, common terminology speaks of information\nstates. Information states may be incomplete and/or\ninconsistent, indeed they may be sub-propositional entirely (as will\nbe the case below when we look at fine-grained information-based\nsemantics for natural languages based on informationalised versions of\nthe Lambek Calculi). In Kripke/frame semantics terms, we have\nternary information frame \\(\\mathbf{F}:\\langle S,\n\\sqsubseteq, R\\rangle\\), where \\(S\\) is a set of\ninformation states, \\(\\sqsubseteq\\) is a partial order on \\(S\\),\nand \\(R\\) is a ternary accessibility\nrelation on members of \\(S\\). An information\nmodel is an information frame \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) along with an\nevaluation/supports relation \\(\\Vdash\\) between members of \\(S\\)\nand types/propositions \\(\\phi, \\psi\\ldots\\). How\nexactly we read \\(x\\Vdash\\phi\\) is going to depend on what sort of\ninformation state \\(x\\) happens to be, and what type of\nthing \\(\\phi\\) is. The simplest case will be when \\(x\\)\nis a situation and \\(\\phi\\) is a proposition. In this case we may read\n\\(x\\Vdash\\phi\\) as \\(\\phi\\) is true at \\(x\\).\nGiven this much,\n (12)\n is translated as follows:\n\\[x\\Vdash\\phi\\to\\psi\\text{ iff }\\forall y, z \\text{ s.t. } Rxyz, \\text{ if }y\\Vdash\\phi\\text{ then }z\\Vdash\\psi.\\]\n\nIn this context, the way that \\(Rxyz\\) is read is\u2014if you take\nthe information that is true at \\(x\\), and you put it\ntogether with the information that is true at \\(y\\),\nthen you get the information that is true at \\(z\\).\nHowever, \\(Rxyz\\) is not read so strictly in general. Although the\n\\(\\Vdash\\) relation can be read as a straightforward semantic\nrelation in line with \\(\\vDash\\), it is considerably more flexible.\nOther readings \\(x\\Vdash\\phi\\) include \\(x\\)\ncarries the information that \\(\\psi\\), \\(x\\)\ncarries the information of type \\(\\psi\\), \\(x\\)\nsupports the information that/of type \\(\\psi\\),\n\\(x\\) is a record of the information that/of type\n\\(\\psi\\), and so on. As a consequence of this, the way that\n\\(Rxyz\\) is read in practice will depend the applications to which the\nresulting information-based semantic models are being put\u2014that\nis, on the domain of the information channels in question.\n\nThe domain of information channels might be anything from channels for\npropositionally structured environmental information along the lines\nFloridi is interested in (be it veridical or not), or\nsub-propositionally structured environmental information along the\nlines Fodor and Evans are interested in. Moreover, it might be\nlinguistically focused sub-propositionally structured information from\nnatural language semantics, or concern semantic informational\nphenomena familiar from issues in the philosophy of language such as\nattitude reports and the semantic analysis of epistemic and other\nattitudinal states. We will examine such approaches in some detail in\nthe section below.\n\nFor now, note that semantic models of different information channel\ntypes will be individuated in terms of how it is that the\n\u201cputting together\u201d of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nin \\(Rxyz\\) is understood precisely. For\nexample, putting \\(x\\) together with \\(y\\)\nmight mean the same thing as putting \\(y\\)\ntogether with \\(x\\), or it might not,\ndepending on whether or not one wants the ternary relation \\(R\\)\nto be a commutative relation. That is, on\nwhether or not one wants it to be the case the \\(\\forall x\\;\\forall\ny\\;\\forall z(Rxyz\\to Ryxz)\\) Whether or not one does want \\(R\\)\nto be a commutative relation will depend on\nproperties of the information channels that one is trying to model\n(for which see the paragraph above).\n\nBy analogy, recall modal logic, where different properties of the\ntwo-place accessibility relation \\(R^2xy\\) will generate different\nmodal logics (for example, to get the modal logic \\(T\\)\none makes \\(R^2xy\\) reflexive, to get the modal logic \\(S4\\) one makes\n\\(R^2xy\\) reflexive and transitive and so on). Similar decisions can\nbe made with regard to the ternary relation \\(Rxyz\\). For example, one\nmight want \\(Rxyz\\) to have the properties of commutativity,\nassociativity, contraction, monotonicity,\nand others, or none at all, or subtle combinations of these and more.\nThese decisions will generate different logics of information\nchannels in the same way as do the choices on \\(R^2\\) with regard\nto different modal logics. These logics are known in general as\nsubstructural logics on account of the way the properties of the\nternary accessibility relation (commutation etc.), correspond to the\nstructural rules that individuate the logics themselves. (One may\nthink of structural rules as the syntactic/proof-theoretic\ncounterparts to the semantic conditions being discussed presently.) As\na part of the growing field of\n logic and information\n more generally, we will see in the following section that clusters of\nsuch logics have found utility across a range of\ninformational-semantic phenomena.\n",
