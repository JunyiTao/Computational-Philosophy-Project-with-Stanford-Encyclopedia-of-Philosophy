A Paradox of Self-Reference in Game Models\nThe first step in any epistemic analysis of a game is to describe\nthe players\u2019 knowledge and beliefs using (a possible variant of)\none of the models introduced in Section 2. As we\nnoted already in Section 2.2, there will be\nstatements about what the players know and believe about the game\nsituation and about each other that are commonly known in some models\nbut not in others.\n\nIn any particular structure, certain beliefs, beliefs about belief,\n\u2026, will be present and others won\u2019t be. So, there is an\nimportant implicit assumption behind the choice of a structure. This\nis that it is \u201ctransparent\u201d to the players that the\nbeliefs in the type structure\u2014and only those beliefs\u2014are\npossible \u2026.The idea is that there is a \u201ccontext\u201d to\nthe strategic situation (e.g., history, conventions, etc.) and this\n\u201ccontext\u201d causes the players to rule out certain\nbeliefs. (Brandenburger & Friedenberg 2010: 801)\n\nRuling out certain configurations of beliefs\nconstitute substantive assumptions about the players\u2019\nreasoning during the decision making process. In other words,\nsubstantive assumptions are about how, and how much, information is\nimparted to the agents, over and above those that are intrinsic to the\nmathematical formulation of the structures used to describe the\nplayers\u2019 information. It is not hard to see that one always\nfinds substantive assumptions in finite structures: Given a countably\ninfinite set of atomic propositions, for instance, in finite\nstructures it will always be common knowledge that some logically\nconsistent combination of these basic facts are not realized,\nand a fortiori for logically consistent configurations of\ninformation and higher-order information about these basic facts. On\nthe other hand, monotonicity of the belief/knowledge operator is a\ntypical example of an assumption that is not\nsubstantive. More generally, there are no models of games, as we\ndefined in Section 2, where it is not common\nknowledge that the players believe all the logical consequences of\ntheir beliefs.[19]\nCan we compare models in terms of the number of substantive\nassumptions that are made? Are there models that make no, or at least\nas few as possible, substantive assumptions? These questions have been\nextensively discussed in the epistemic foundations of game\ntheory\u2014see the discussion in Samuelson (1992) and the references\nin Moscati (2009). Intuitively, a structure without any substantive\nassumptions must represent all possible states of (higher-order)\ninformation. Whether such a structure exists will depend, in part, on\nhow the players\u2019 informational attitudes are\nrepresented\u2014e.g., as (conditional/lexicographic) probability\nmeasures or set-valued knowledge/belief functions. These questions\nhave triggered interest in the existence of \u201crich\u201d models\ncontaining most, if not all, possible configurations of (higher-order)\nknowledge and beliefs.\nThere are different ways to understand what it means for a\nstructure to minimize the substantive assumptions about the\nplayers\u2019 higher-order information. We do not attempt a complete\noverview of this interesting literature here (see Brandenburger &\nKeisler (2006: sec. 11) and Siniscalchi (2008: sec. 3) for discussion\nand pointers to the relevant results). One approach considers the\nspace of all (Harsanyi type-/Kripke-/epistemic-plausibility-)\nstructures and tries to find a single structure that, in some suitable\nsense, \u201ccontains\u201d all other structures. Such a structure,\noften called called a universal structure (or a terminal\nobject in the language of category theory), if it exists,\nincorporates any substantive assumption that an analyst can\nimagine. Such structure have been shown to exists for Harsanyi type\nspaces (Mertens & Zamir 1985; Brandenburger & Dekel 1993). For\nKripke structures, the question has been answered in the negative\n(Heifetz & Samet 1998; Fagin, Geanakoplos, Halpern, & Vardi\n1999; Meier 2005), with some qualifications regarding the language\nthat is used to describe them (Heifetz 1999; Roy & Pacuit\n2013).\nA second approach takes an internal perspective by asking\nwhether, for a fixed set of states or types, the agents are\nmaking any substantive assumptions about what their opponents know or\nbelieve. The idea is to identify (in a given model) a set of\npossible conjectures about the players. For example, in a\nknowledge structure based on a set of states \\(W\\) this might be the set\nof all subsets of \\(W\\) or the set definable subsets of \\(W\\) in some\nsuitable logical language. A space is said to be complete if\neach agent correctly takes into account each possible conjecture about\nher opponents. A simple counting argument shows that there cannot\nexist a complete structure when the set of conjectures is all\nsubsets of the set of states (Brandenburger 2003). However, there is a\ndeeper result here which we discuss below.\nThe Brandenburger-Keisler Paradox\nAdam Brandenburger and H. Jerome Keisler (2006) introduce the\nfollowing two person, Russel-style paradox. The statement of the\nparadox involves two concepts: beliefs and\nassumptions. An assumption is a player\u2019s strongest\nbelief: it is a set of states that implies all other beliefs at a\ngiven state. We will say more about the interpretation of an\nassumption below. Suppose there are two players, Ann and Bob, and\nconsider the following description of beliefs.\n\n(S)\nAnn believes that Bob assumes that Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong.\n\n\nA paradox arises by asking the question\n\n(Q)\nDoes Ann believe that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong?\n\nTo ease the discussion, let \\(C\\) be Bob\u2019s assumption in (S):\nthat is, \\(C\\) is the statement \u201cAnn believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is wrong.\u201d So, (Q) asks whether \\(C\\) is true or\nfalse. We will argue that \\(C\\) is true if, and only if, \\(C\\) is\nfalse.\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is true. Then, Ann does believe that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is wrong, and, by introspection, she believes that she\nbelieves this. That is to say, Ann believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect. Furthermore, according to (S), Ann believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is \\(C\\). So, Ann, in fact, believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is correct (she believes Bob\u2019s assumption is \\(C\\) and\nthat \\(C\\) is correct). So, \\(C\\) is false.\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is false. This means that Ann believes that\nBob\u2019s assumption is correct. That is, Ann believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect (By (S), Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is\n\\(C\\)). Furthermore, by (S), we have that Ann believes that Bob\nassumes that Ann believes that \\(C\\) is wrong. So, Ann believes\nthat she believes that \\(C\\) is correct and she believes that Bob\nassumption is that she believes that \\(C\\) is wrong. So, it is true that\nshe believes Bob\u2019s assumptions is wrong (Ann believes that\nBob\u2019s assumption is she believes that \\(C\\) is wrong, but\nshe believes that is wrong: she believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect). So, \\(C\\) is true.\nBrandenburger and Keisler formalize the above argument in order to\nprove a very strong impossibility result about the existence of\nso-called assumption-complete structures. We need some\nnotation to state this result. It will be most convenient to work in\nqualitative type spaces for two players\n(Definition 2.7). A qualitative type space\nfor two players (cf. Definition 2.7. The set\nof states is not important in what follows, so we leave it out) is a\nstructure \\(\\langle \\{T_A, T_B\\}, \\{\\lambda_A, \\lambda_B\\}\\rangle\\)\nwhere\n\n\\[\\lambda_A:T_A\\rightarrow \\pow(T_B)\\qquad\\lambda_B:T_B\\rightarrow\\pow(T_A)\\]\n\nA set of conjectures about Ann is a subset\n\\(\\C_A\\subseteq \\pow(T_A)\\) (similarly, the set of conjectures about Bob\nis a subset \\(\\C_B\\subseteq \\pow(T_B)\\)). A structure \\(\\langle \\{T_A,\nT_B\\}, \\{\\lambda_A, \\lambda_B\\}\\rangle\\) is said to\nbe assumption-complete for the conjectures \\(\\C_A\\) and\n\\(\\C_B\\) provided for each conjecture in \\(\\C_A\\) there is a type that\nassumes that conjecture (similarly for Bob). Formally, for each\n\\(Y\\in\\C_B\\) there is a \\(t_0\\in T_A\\) such that \\(\\lambda_A(t_0)=Y\\), and\nsimilarly for Bob. As we remarked above, a simple counting argument\nshows that when \\(\\C_A=\\pow(T_A)\\) and \\(\\C_B=\\pow(T_B)\\), then\nassumption-complete models only exist in trivial cases. A much deeper\nresult is:\n\nTheorem 6.1 (Brandenburger & Keisler 2006: Theorem 5.4)\nThere is no assumption-complete type structure for the set of\nconjectures that contains the first-order definable subsets.\n\nSee the supplement for a discussion of the proof of this theorem\n(see Section 2).\nConsult Pacuit (2007) and  Abramsky & Zvesper (2010) for an extensive analysis and\ngeneralization of this result. But, it is not all bad news: Mariotti,\nMeier, & Piccione (2005) construct a complete structure where the\nset of conjectures are compact subsets of some well-behaved\ntopological space.\n",
