    "main_text": "The Case for Neutral Monism || Unity of Science\n3.5 Unity of Science\n\nMach operates on the assumption that all sciences form a whole (see\nMach 1886: 30). The great virtue of neutral monism is that it affords\na unified perspective from which scientific inquiry can be\nundertaken:\n\nwhat I aimed at was merely to attain a safe and clear philosophical\nstandpoint, whence practicable paths, shrouded in no metaphysical\nclouds, might be seen leading not only into the field of physics but\nalso into that of psycho-physiology. (Mach 1886: 47)\n\n\nThe idea of neutral monism as a bridge between different sciences is\nalso present in Russell. He presents neutral monism as\n\nan attempt to harmonize two different tendencies, one in psychology,\nthe other in physics\u2026[viz.]\u2026the materialistic tendency\nof psychology and the anti-materialistic tendency of physics. (Russell\n1921: 5\u20136)\n\n",
