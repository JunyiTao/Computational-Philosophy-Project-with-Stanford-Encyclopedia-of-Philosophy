    "main_text": "Securitist Views || A Synchronic Actualist-Possibilist Case\n4.1 A Synchronic Actualist-Possibilist Case\n\nConsider Goldman\u2019s (1978: 186) case, which we\u2019ll call\nTraffic 1:\n\n Traffic 1: Jones is driving\nthrough a tunnel behind a slow-moving truck. It is illegal to change\nlanes in the tunnel, and Jones\u2019 doing so would disrupt traffic.\nNevertheless she is going to change lanes [at t]\u2014perhaps\nshe doesn\u2019t realize it is illegal, or perhaps she is simply in a\nhurry. If she changes lanes without accelerating [at t],\ntraffic will be disrupted more severely than if she accelerates. If\nshe accelerates without changing lanes [at t], her car will\ncollide with the back of a truck.\n\n\nAccording to Goldman, it seems that Jones should\n\u27e8accelerate\u27e9 at t since Jones is going to\n\u27e8change lanes\u27e9 at t, and \u27e8accelerating\n& changing lanes\u27e9 at t would result in a better\noutcome than that of \u27e8not accelerating & changing\nlanes\u27e9. But now consider this case:\n\n Traffic 2: Everything that is true in\nTraffic 1 is true in this case. Additionally, Jones would\n\u27e8not accelerate\u27e9 at t if Jones were to either\n\u27e8change lanes\u27e9 or \u27e8not change lanes\u27e9 at\nt.\n\n\nIn Traffic 2 Jones \u27e8changes lanes and doesn\u2019t\naccelerate\u27e9 at t. It seems that Jones should \u27e8not\nchange lanes\u27e9 at t since she is going to \u27e8not\naccelerate\u27e9 at t. But it also seems that Jones should\n\u27e8accelerate\u27e9 at t since she is going to\n\u27e8change lanes\u27e9. We have arrived at the verdict that in\nTraffic 2 Jones should \u27e8not change lanes\u27e9 and\nthat Jones should \u27e8accelerate\u27e9. This verdict is\nextremely counterintuitive since this would result in colliding with\nthe back of the truck, which is the worst possible outcome. \n\nAccording to Goldman, the lesson to be gleamed from synchronic\nactualist-possibilist cases is this: In determining what we are\nobligated at t to do at t, we should not hold fixed\nfacts about what we are freely doing at t. Moreover, such synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not determine in any way what an agent is obligated\nto do at any time. Consequently, the kind of immediate act-set that is\na candidate for being obligatory is the fully specific simultaneous\nact-set that is immediately available to Jones. A performable fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set is one such that one cannot also perform\nany other act-set at the relevant time. Goldman (1978: 190) calls such\nact-sets maximal conjunctive acts, but this entry will stick with the\nterminology of a fully specific simultaneous act-set in order\nto avoid ambiguation with other notions of act-sets at issue in this\npaper. Let\u2019s suppose that the (immediate) fully specific\nsimultaneous act-sets available to Jones are ranked from best to worst\nas follows. \n\n \u27e8Don\u2019t change lanes & don\u2019t\naccelerate\u27e9\n \u27e8Change lanes & accelerate\u27e9\n \u27e8Change lanes & don\u2019t accelerate\u27e9\n \u27e8Don\u2019t change lanes & accelerate\u27e9\n\n\nAccording to Goldman, given options (1)\u2013(4), Jones should\nobviously perform (1). Moreover, notice that if Jones were to\nperform (1), then the following synchronic counterfactual that is in\nfact true in Traffic 2 would be false instead: \u201cif\nJones were to \u27e8not accelerate\u27e9 at t, then at\nt Jones would \u27e8change lanes\u27e9\u201d. So, given\nthe intuition that Jones is obligated to perform (1) and that doing so\nwould alter the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals, we\nshould not hold fixed the truth-value of such synchronic\ncounterfactuals when theorizing about an agent\u2019s obligation to\nperform some immediate fully specific simultaneous act-set. To\naccommodate this judgment, Goldman\u2019s (1978) revised view\nincorporates a control condition over the truth-value of such\nsynchronic counterfactuals.\n",
