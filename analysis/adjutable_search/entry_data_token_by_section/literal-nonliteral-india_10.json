    "main_text": "Suggested Meaning and Speaker\u2019s Intention || Varieties of Suggested Meaning\n3.2 Varieties of Suggested Meaning\nWhile one can present a definitive number of types of suggestion (Abhinavagupta says there are thirty-five), \u0100nandavardhana himself says there are an endless number of combinations if we take into account all of the facts involved in creating suggested meaning. Whether this should be taken literally or as a rhetorical flourish, the point is that \u0100nandavardhana does not view his analysis as a complete taxonomy of suggested meaning. In keeping with this spirit, only a few of the important divisions are discussed below.\n\u0100nandavardhana subdivides suggestion in two ways based on two kinds of intentions a speaker has with regard to the expression she utters. This is consistent with his view that underlying all cases of suggestion there is a purpose (prayojana) the speaker has in choosing a particular expression. In particular, these intentions are defined in terms of the speaker\u2019s attitude towards the primary meaning of an expression. First, a speaker may intend to convey the primary meaning plus some suggested meaning. Second, she may not intend to convey the primary meaning, but only have an intention to convey a suggested meaning.\nAs an example of the first type, \u0100nandavardhana cites love poetry written by the Buddhist philosopher Dharmak\u012brti (ca 6th to 7th century CE, see the entry on Dharmak\u012brti). The poem describes images of birds and fruit which are meant to be taken literally. However, these images are juxtaposed in a way which suggests an additional sense consistent with the romantic tone of the poem. There is no explicit comparison between the images, but the comparison is suggested. This kind of suggestion is something like the phenomenon in Ezra Pound\u2019s famous imagist poem, \u201cIn a Station of a Metro\u201d\n\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd;\nPetals on a wet, black bough. (Pound 1913)\n\nThere is no linguistic metaphor in the sense of an explicit predication between two things, such as faces and petals. However, the reader understands an implicit comparisons between the two images. Thus there is both primary and suggested meaning. Other times, \u0100nandavardhana says, the speaker intends only to convey a suggested meaning, so the primary meaning may be entirely replaced or set aside in some manner. For example, in this passage from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the phrase \u201cblinded\u201d is not being used in a primary sense, but in a suggestive manner:\n\nThe sun has stolen our affection for the moon,\nwhose circle is now dull with frost\nand like a mirror blinded by breath,\nshines no more. (DL: 209)\n\nSince a mirror cannot, strictly speaking, be made blind\u2014breath merely fogs it\u2014this is a case where the speaker intends what is suggested to replace the primary meaning.\nWhile the previous categories are distinguished by the speaker\u2019s aims, the two other categories are distinguished by the hearer\u2019s experience. \u0100nandavardhana says that when hearers come to understand the suggested meaning of a poem, they can do so either instantaneously or else after a \u201creverberation\u201d\u2014some experienced temporal gap between recovering the literal meaning and recovering the suggested meaning. The suggested content characterized by reverberation may be similar to what contemporary philosophers talk about in terms of the metaphorical \u201cfelt gap\u201d between literal and metaphorical meanings in particular (e.g., Camp & Reimer 2008). However, it also includes the idea of a temporal gap between understanding the literal and suggested meaning. The phenomenological observation can, and should, be distinguished from a claim about content recovery. \u0100nandavardhana does not appeal to the phenomenology of suggested meanings as evidence that they are recovered in a certain way, though such a move was certainly available to him, as we have seen in section 1.2.\n\u0100nandavardhana categorizes a case of bitextuality (\u015ble\u1e63a) as involving reverberation, as both meanings do not occur to the reader simultaneously. Further he describes this as a case where the sentence (rather than individual words) suggests a second meaning, which comes like a \u201creverberation\u201d or some time after the first. This supports the idea that reverberation is about processing time, rather than (or in addition to) a felt tension. Elsewhere, \u0100nandavardhana points out that for many kinds of suggestion, hearers do not have a \u201creverberation\u201d or awareness of a gap between the primary meaning and what is suggested. Abhinavagupta gives an analogy to explain cases where there is no such reverberation. He says that when someone has taken to heart the relationship between smoke and fire, she will be able to reason inferentially to the existence of fire simply on the perceptual basis of smoke. There need not be any awareness of inferential processes on the part of the thinker.\n\u0100nandavardhana distinguishes in a number of other ways between varieties of suggestion. He identifies the basis of suggestion: word meanings, sentence meanings, discourse unit meanings, and even the sounds of individual phonemes can all give rise to suggested meaning. A poem\u2019s entire \u201cmeaning,\u201d that is, a comparison which may not be explicit in the poem, but is suggested throughout, can itself be the basis for a suggested rasa, such as love or heroism. At a more local level, individual phonemes within a poem may also suggest an aesthetic mood, through being sonorous or harsh, etc. These distinctions within suggested meaning underscore the need for caution in drawing equivalence between suggestion and analytic philosophical concepts, such as implicature (see the entry on implicature) which is roughly analogous to, but not co-extensive with, \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s dhvani, since \u0100nandavardhana denies that suggestion arises through inferential reasoning.\n",
