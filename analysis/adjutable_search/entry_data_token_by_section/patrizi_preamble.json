    "main_text": "\n\n\nRenaissance, Francesco Patrizi of Cherso (1529-1597) was a leading\ncritic of the dominant Aristotelianism of the times. Not to be\nconfused with the earlier humanist and political theoretician,\nFrancesco Patrizi of Siena (1413-1494), Patrizi of Cherso focused his\nattention on a wide variety of philosophical, scientific, artistic and\nliterary issues, providing in his \u201cNew Philosophy\u201d a major\nalternative to earlier schools of thought and a model which later\nthinkers such as Galileo Galilei no doubt found valuable in developing\nthe mathematized physics which would prove the dominant force in the\nrise of early modern science. In addition, Patrizi's\nresearch into the history of ancient and medieval philosophical sources\nas an essential part of his method for establishing the legitimacy of\nhis own position would make those texts available to his contemporaries\nin a way they had never been before and serve as a model for future\ngenerations of scholars. It also emphasized the centrality of the\nstudy of the history of philosophy as an integral part of engaging in\nphilosophical investigation in its own right.\n",
