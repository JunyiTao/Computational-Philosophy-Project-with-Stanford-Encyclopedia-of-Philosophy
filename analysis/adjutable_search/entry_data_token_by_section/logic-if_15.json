Their metalogical properties have been explained\nand the philosophical relevance of these properties has been\ndiscussed. The suggested consequences of these logics for\nphilosophical issues such as the existence of a self-applied\ntruth-predicate, the logicist program, the philosophical relevance of\naxiomatic set theory, and informational independence in natural\nlanguages have been covered as well. Slash logic and dependence logic\n\u2013 both closely related to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and inspired by it\n\u2013 were also briefly considered.\n",
