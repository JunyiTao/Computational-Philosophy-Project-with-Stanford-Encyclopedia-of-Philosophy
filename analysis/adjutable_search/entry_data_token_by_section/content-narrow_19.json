    "main_text": "Strategies for Determining Narrow Content || Epistemic Strategy\n5.4 Epistemic Strategy\n\nThe epistemic strategy is recommended by Chalmers (2002, 2003, 2006).\nThe framework that gives rise to this strategy was presented in\nsection 3.5. Narrow contents are to be thought of as effecting a\npartition of scenarios, which are similar to the centered worlds\nemployed by the diagonalization strategy, into those endorsed by the\nthought and those excluded by it. But how exactly are we to determine\nwhich scenarios are which? On the diagonalization strategy, we make\nuse of our preexisting grasp of ordinary content to determine what\nordinary content the thought would express if it were located at the\ncenter of a particular centered world, and then determine whether that\nordinary content is true at that centered world. The epistemic\nstrategy is radically different, and treats narrow content as at least\nas fundamental as ordinary content.\n\nSo, what function from scenarios to truth values constitutes the\nnarrow content of my thought that the lakes contain water? Put\nslightly differently, which scenarios does this narrow content include\nand which does it exclude? To find out whether the narrow content of\nthe thought that the lakes contain water includes a given scenario, I\nconsider the hypothesis that the scenario is actual. For example, if I\nconsider the hypothesis that a scenario in which the oceans and lakes\naround me contain H2O is actual, then I will be led by a\npriori reasoning to the conclusion that the lakes contain water;\nhence, the narrow content of my thought that the lakes contain water\nincludes this Twin Earthly scenario. Similarly, if I consider the\nhypothesis that a scenario in which the oceans and lakes contain XYZ\nis actual, I will still conclude that the lakes contain water, since\nin Twin Earth scenarios my water-thoughts are about XYZ. So the Twin\nEarthly scenario is also included in the narrow content of my thought\nthat the lakes contain water. By contrast, the narrow content of my\nthought that water is H2O will separate these two\nscenarios. If I consider the hypothesis that an Earthly scenario is\nactual, I will conclude that water is H2O, so the narrow\ncontent of the thought that water is H2O includes Earthly\nscenarios. However, if I consider the hypothesis that a Twin Earthly\nscenario is actual, I will conclude that water is not H2O\n(rather, it is XYZ), so the narrow content of my thought that water is\nH2O excludes Twin Earthly scenarios.\n\nIt is crucial that when I consider the hypothesis that the\nTwin-Earthly (or any other) scenario is actual, and ask whether, in\nthat case, my thought that lakes contain water is true, I am\nnot asking whether, had a Twin-Earthly world obtained, lakes\nwould have contained water. The answer to that question is\n\u201cno,\u201d but it is a different question. When I ask this\nlatter question, I am considering the Twin-Earthly world as\ncounterfactual. Presupposing that the world is not actually that way,\nI ask what would be true if it were that way. Such questions, in which\nwe consider alternative worlds as counterfactual, are the appropriate\nway to determine issues of metaphysical possibility. The sort\nof question relevant to epistemic possibility is different.\nIt involves considering scenarios as actual, not as\ncounterfactual: seeing what is the case if the world\nis that way, not seeing what would be the case if\nthe world were that way. Questions about epistemic\npossibility, in which we consider scenarios as actual, are naturally\nposed in indicative conditionals: if the substance in the lakes\nis XYZ, is it water?\n\nA full account must say much more than this about precisely what it is\nto consider a scenario as actual, and what it is for a scenario to be\nendorsed by a particular belief. In order to consider a scenario, we\nmust have a complete description of some sort. On the other hand,\nthere must be restrictions on the vocabulary in which the description\nis expressed. In particular, it cannot contain expressions like\n\u2018water\u2019, for which Twin Earth examples can be constructed.\nChalmers offers a detailed account that addresses such questions.\n(This is presented briefly in Chalmers 2002 and Chalmers 2003, and in\nmuch more detail in Chalmers 2006.) Here is the short version\n(Chalmers 2002, p. 611):\n\nTo consider a scenario W as actual is to consider the hypothesis that\nD is the case, where D is a canonical description of W. When\nscenarios are understood as centered worlds, a canonical description\nwill conjoin an objective description of the character of W\n(including its mental and physical character, for example), with an\nindexical description of the center\u2019s location within\nW. The objective description will be restricted to semantically\nneutral terms: roughly, terms that are not themselves vulnerable\nto Twin Earth thought experiments (thus excluding most names, natural\nkind terms, indexicals, and terms used with semantic deference). The\nindexical description will allow in addition indexical terms such as\n\u2018I\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019, to specify the center\u2019s\nlocation. We can then say that W verifies a thought T when a\nhypothesis that D is the case implies T. Or equivalently, where S is a\nlinguistic expression of T, W verifies T when a material conditional\n\u2018if D, then S\u2019 is a priori.\n\n\nUnlike the diagonalization strategy, the epistemic strategy does not\ndepend on a prior determination of the broad content of the expression\nor state. Moreover, it does not require that narrow contents be\nevaluated only in scenarios that contain a token of the mental state\nat their center.\n\nPotential problems for the epistemic strategy include: (1) whether it\ncan be applied to nonhuman animals, many of whom presumably also have\ncontentful mental states; (2) whether a canonical language that\nsatisfies the necessary constraints is possible (see e.g. Schroeter\n2004; Soames 2005, pp. 216\u2013218; Sawyer 2007); and (3) whether a\nversion of the \u201cwhat is held constant\u201d problem for the\ndiagonalization strategy also poses problems for the epistemic\nstrategy. (This last point is discussed a bit further in section\n6.2.)\n",
