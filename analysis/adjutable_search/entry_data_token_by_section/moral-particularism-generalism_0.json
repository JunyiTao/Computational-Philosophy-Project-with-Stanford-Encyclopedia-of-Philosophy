    "main_text": "Historical Introduction\n1. Historical Introduction\n\nAristotle might reasonably be characterized as the\n\u201cforefather\u201d of particularism. Aristotle famously\nemphasizes that ethical inquiry is mistaken if it aims for \u201ca\ndegree of exactness\u201d too great for its subject matter, and added\nthat moral generalizations can hold only \u201cfor the most\npart\u201d. Moreover, Aristotle tirelessly emphasizes that ethics\nultimately concerns particular cases, that no theory can fully address\nthem all, and that \u201cjudgment depends on perception\u201d (NE,\n1109b). These ideas have all deeply inspired contemporary\nparticularists (John McDowell is a prominent case, though he does not\ntend to label himself as a particularist; see McDowell 1981, 1998).\nWhether Aristotle should ultimately be interpreted as a particularist\nis a matter of debate (Irwin 2000; Leibovitz 2013).\n\nInterestingly, no single major historic figure is most obviously\ncharacterized as the \u201cforefather\u201d of generalism. This is\npresumably because the most important historic generalists in effect\ndefended generalism by defending specific moral theories or\nprinciples. The two most important traditions here are the\ndeontological tradition which owes so much to Kant, and the\nconsequentialist tradition which owes so much to the British\nutilitarians (Bentham, Mill and Sidgwick). Nonetheless, each of these\ntraditions substantially enriched the generalist approach with a\nwealth of ideas and distinctions which need not be restricted to the\ntheories in which they were originally formulated.\n\nThe Kantian tradition puts enormous weight on the idea that morality\nmust be principled and that the ultimate principle of morality must be\none we can know a priori. According to Kant, the moral law as\napplied to imperfect agents who are subject to temptations, provides\nwhat he called a \u201ccategorical imperative\u201d\u2014an\nimperative whose rational authority is not dependent on the\nagent\u2019s contingent ends. Kant provided several formulations of\nthe categorical imperative. The so-called \u201cuniversal law\u201d\nformulation holds that one must always act so that one\u2019s maxim\ncould at the same time be willed as a universal law. The humanity\nformulation holds that one must always act so as to treat humanity,\nwhether in one\u2019s own person or that of another, always as an end\nand never merely as a means. The Kantian tradition emphasizes common\nsense moral ideas like respect and dignity, and provides a distinctive\ninterpretation of the role of universalizability in moral thought. On\nsome readings of Kant, the moral law must itself be\nconstitutive of being a rational agent at all. This idea has,\nin turn, been enormously influential, especially in the late twentieth\nand early twenty-first century.\n\nConsequentialism enriched the generalist framework in other ways. Most\nnotably, perhaps, consequentialists have often distinguished between\ntwo very different kinds of principles, corresponding to two\nrather different roles they may play. On the one hand, there\nare principles\u2014call them \u201cstandards\u201d\u2014which\nprovide the deepest explanation of why certain actions are\nright or wrong. On the other hand, there are the principles which\nordinary agents ought to follow in their day to day deliberations.\nSuch principles are \u201cguides\u201d. Consider a simple analogy\nwith the stock market. The principle which explains what counts as\nsuccess might simply be \u201cbuy low and sell high\u201d, but this\nprinciple is woefully inadequate as a guide to making investment\ndecisions in real time. A principle like \u201chave a diversified\nportfolio\u201d seems much more suitable for the latter role.\n\nEach of these traditions (the Kantian and the consequentialist) faces\na number of prima facie powerful objections. It is therefore\nperhaps not surprising that there was ultimately a reaction against\nthe broader generalist aspirations that these theories embodied. On\nsome readings, one of the earliest particularists in the modern sense\nwas Ewing, who in The Morality of Punishment (1929) argued\nthat consequentialism and deontology were the only plausible\nprincipled conceptions of morality, that neither was defensible, and\nthat morality was therefore not principled (cf. Lind &\nBr\u00e4nnmark 2008 interview with Dancy, who explicitly characterizes\nEwing in this way at p. 10).\n\nJust one year after Ewing in effect defended a fairly radical form of\nmoral particularism, W.D. Ross argued for a more moderate form. Ross\noccupies a very interesting place in the history of particularism, as\nhe has served as both an inspiration and a foil to modern\nparticularists. Ross put forward a battery of \u201cprima\nfacie duties\u201d specifying types of conduct\u2014for example\nacts of gratitude\u2014that are always, in some sense, obligatory.\nThe obligation in question need not be an all things considered one,\nhowever, since a conflicting prima facie duty might, in the\ncircumstances, be more important.\n\nSetting aside whether Ross thought anything theoretically useful could\nbe said about how to adjudicate conflicts of prima facie\nduty, he did not think it useful to try to formulate exceptionless\nprinciples with regard to all things considered duty (cf. Postow\n2006). Ross thus appears to be a generalist about prima facie\nduty, but a defender of particularism about overall duty. Some\ncontemporary particularists, however, insist on going beyond Ross and\ncasting doubt even on principles of prima facie duty, or\nprinciples specifying which considerations are pro tanto (or\n\u201ccontributory\u201d in Jonathan Dancy\u2019s terminology)\nreasons.\n\nJonathan Dancy has done more than anyone to articulate and defend an\nespecially radical form of particularism. Although Ross was both a\nfoil and an inspiration for Dancy, R.M. Hare was a more immediate\nopponent. Hare\u2019s prescriptivism drew on ideas from both the\nKantian and the consequentialist tradition. Hare defended a strong\nform of universalizability which can be traced to Kant, but Hare then\nargued that universalizability lent support not to a deontological\nmoral theory, but to a form of consequentialism. Indeed it led to a\nform of consequentialism which emphasized the distinction between\nstandards and guides (cf. Hare 1963).\n\nIn the introduction of Moral Reasons, Dancy summarizes his\nconclusions as the \u201cmirror image\u201d of Hare\u2019s. Perhaps\nmost notably, Dancy objected to an idea which he took to be implicit\nin Hare\u2019s universalizability principle, that if a consideration\nis a reason in one context then it is a reason with the same valence\nin any possible context in which it occurs. (This reading of\nHare is open to objection. See McNaughton and Rawlings (2000) for\ndiscussion.) Dancy calls this idea, which he also attributes to Ross,\n\u201catomism\u201d in the theory of reasons and argues against it\nand in favour of what he calls \u201cholism\u201d.\n\nAs Dancy\u2019s early work came to fruition, it inspired his\nthen-colleague David McNaughton to advance distinct but complementary\narguments for particularism. McNaughton was also heavily influenced by\nthe work of John McDowell, who had argued that it was an advantage of\nhis own brand of moral realism that it did not presuppose generalism\n(see McDowell 1981; see also Blackburn 1981). In Moral\nVision, McNaughton defended a form of moral realism which he\nargued lent support to particularism. He also argued that\nparticularism better accounts for moral conflict, fits reasonably well\nwith ordinary practice and can explain why we might reasonably be\nsuspicious of the very idea of a moral expert.\n\nThe work of Dancy and McNaughton inspired a host of other philosophers\nto carry forward the particularist research programme, sometimes in\nrather different directions. This eventually led to a wide variety of\nviews all going under the heading of \u201cparticularism\u201d. Nor\nwere the challenges posed by these many moral particularisms ignored\nby those with more generalist sympathies. Woken from their generalist\nslumbers, they began to develop arguments for generalism which did not\ndepend on the correctness of any particular moral principle(s). This\ngenerated a healthy debate, the contours of which the rest of this\nentry will outline.\n",
