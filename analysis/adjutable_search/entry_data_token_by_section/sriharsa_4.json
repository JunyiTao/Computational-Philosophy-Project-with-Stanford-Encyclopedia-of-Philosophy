    "main_text": "Epistemology || The Challenge of Epistemic Luck\n2.1 The Challenge of Epistemic Luck\n\nThe very first definition of knowledge that \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\nattacks is offered by Udayana in his Garland of Definitions\n(Lak\u1e63a\u1e47am\u0101l\u0101) (Jh\u0101 1963: 3).\n\n\nknowledge i Knowledge is non-mnemonic\nawareness of the truth (tattv\u0101nubh\u016bti).\n\n\n\nAfter offering a long series of objections against the definitions of\ntruth (tattva) and non-mnemonic awareness\n(anubh\u016bti), \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a proceeds to give a\ngeneral argument against this definition: it overextends to the case\nof accidentally true (k\u0101kat\u0101l\u012bya-samv\u0101da)\nawareness (KKh 207\u2013208). He then proceeds to give some examples\nof such accidentally true awareness that we can flesh out as\nfollows.\n\n\nShells. Holding five shells in his closed fist, a bookie asks\nthe gambler, \u201cHow many shells do I have in my hand?\u201d The\ngambler hasn\u2019t seen the contents of the bookie\u2019s hand,\nbut, for some reason, he has a hunch that there are five shells in the\nbookie\u2019s hand. On that basis, he judges that there are five\nshells in the bookie\u2019s hand. So, he replies, \u201cFive.\u201d\nDoes that mean that he knows this claim? Surely not: the gambler has\nhit the truth merely accidentally (KKh 208).\n\nMist. You look at a far-away hill, and see what looks like\nsmoke emerging from it. So, you judge that there is smoke on the hill.\nSince you know that fire always accompanies smoke, you infer,\n\u201cThere\u2019s fire on the hill.\u201d In fact, what you saw\nwas just mist, but there is in fact fire on the hill. Your awareness\ntherefore is true, but is it knowledge? Once again, you have only\naccidentally hit the truth, and therefore you lack knowledge (KKh\n211).\n\nHorns. An animal comes into your view, but you are unable to\ntell what it is. A little later, as you get closer, you see horns on\nthe animal\u2019s head. Falsely, you believe that only cows have\nhorns. So, you infer, \u201cThat animal is a cow.\u201d Your\nawareness is true, but only accidentally so. That is why you lack\nknowledge (KKh 213).\n\n\nThese are cases of epistemic luck: in each case, the protagonist hits\nthe truth, but only luckily so. That is why he or she lacks knowledge.\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s discussion of these counterexamples\nto the \u201ctrue awareness\u201d account of knowledge is\nsignificant for two reasons.\n\nFirst of all, Mist and Horns clearly conform to the\nstructure of standard Gettier cases; similar examples are also\ndiscussed by classical Indian philosophers such as Dharmottara,\nKum\u0101rila, and Sr\u012bdhara (Matilal 1986: ch. 4; Ganeri 2007:\nch. 5; Stoltz 2007). Even though \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\ndoesn\u2019t intend these examples to be counterexample to any\n\u201cjustified true belief\u201d account of knowledge, he does seem\nto think that in order to rule out cases of this kind from the scope\nof knowledge, we need to impose an anti-luck condition on knowledge.\nAnd this is precisely the lesson that philosophers have drawn from the\ncases of epistemic luck described by Gettier (1963). What this suggests is that\nthe kind of intuitions that Gettier and others were trying to\nelicit with such cases are not intuitions shared by a narrow group of\nAnglophone philosophers. This, in turn, casts doubt on\narguments\u2014offered by early researchers in experimental\nphilosophy (Weinberg et al 2001; Weinberg 2007)\u2014which sought to\ndebunk Gettier intuitions by showing that they might just have been\nartifacts of a certain culture. The history of Indian philosophy in\nSanskrit shows that even in classical India, Gettier phenomena were\nrecognized as a potential problem for theories of knowledge that\ndidn\u2019t include any anti-luck condition. This, one might argue,\nshould bolster our confidence in treating such intuitions as evidence\nin philosophical inquiry.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a uses\nthese cases to argue that there may not after all be any satisfactory\ndefinition of knowledge. Even though \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s\ncriticisms are directed against proposals of knowledge defended by his\npredecessors and contemporaries, his arguments remain relevant to\ntoday\u2019s discussions of knowledge. On the one hand, he\nanticipates some of the problems that arise for recent attempts at\nsolving the Gettier problem, e.g., \u00adconditions like\nsensitivity and safety and theories like the\nrelevant alternatives theory. On the other hand, he also\nclaims that the problem posed by cases of epistemic luck cannot be\navoided simply by treating knowledge\u2014as Williamson (2000)\ndoes\u2014as analytically primitive. The following three sections\nsurvey some of these arguments.\n",
