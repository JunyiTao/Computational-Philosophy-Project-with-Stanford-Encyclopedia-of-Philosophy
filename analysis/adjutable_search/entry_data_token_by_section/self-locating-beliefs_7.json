    "main_text": "Theoretical Responses || Centered worlds\n3.1 Centered worlds\n\nOn Lewis\u2019s view, what\u2019s distinctive about self-locating\nbeliefs is their content. Instead of taking the objects of\nbelief to be possible worlds propositions, we take them to be\nproperties. Equivalently, we can take them to be sets of centered\nworlds. A centered world is a set-theoretic object that models a\nposition or a location within a world; it\u2019s easiest to think of\na centered world as a \\(\\langle \\textrm{world}, \\textrm{time},\n\\textrm{individual}\\rangle\\) triple. (Absent clever science-fictional\nexamples, specifying a world and then a time and an individual within\nthat world suffices to specify the intended sort of position or\nlocation. See Liao (2012) for troublemaking clever science-fictional\nexamples, and for discussion.) Treating objects of belief as sets of\ncentered worlds is equivalent to treating them as properties because\nfor each property \\(F\\), there\u2019s a set of centered worlds that\nincludes a given \\(\\langle w,t,i\\rangle\\) triple iff \\(i\\) has \\(F\\)\nat \\(t\\) in \\(w\\), and for each set of centered worlds, there\u2019s\na property that\u2019s shared by all and only those individuals in\nthose worlds at those times. (Note that this requires a plenitudinous\nontology of properties, to which Lewis is already independently\ncommitted. Those who subscribe to enough Lewisian metaphysics can\nalso, equivalently, treat the objects of belief as sets of worldbound\ntime-slices.) We will call a set of centered worlds a\ncentered-worlds proposition or a centered\nproposition, and a belief with a centered-worlds proposition as\nits content a centered belief.\n\nLewis (1979) argues that properties/centered-worlds propositions can\ndo all of the attitude-characterizing work of traditional\npossible-worlds propositions, and more besides. For each\npossible-worlds proposition P, there\u2019s a corresponding\nproperty (centered-worlds proposition)\u2014the property of\ninhabiting a P-world, a.k.a. the set of triples \\(\\langle\nw,t,i\\rangle\\) such that \\(w\\) is a P-world. But there are\nalso more properties and centered-worlds propositions\u2014ones that\nsometimes distinguish between worldmates, such that one individual in\na world has the property and another doesn\u2019t, or such that an\nindividual in a world has the property at some times but not others.\nLet\u2019s call the first kind of property or centered proposition\nboring and the second kind interesting. Where a\npossible-worlds proposition would do as an object of belief, the\ncorresponding boring property or centered proposition will do as well\n(see Nolan 2006 for dissent, and Turner 2010 and Feit 2010 for\ndefense). So every doxastic state that we could represent using belief\nrelations to possible-worlds propositions\u2014every one that\nappeared in the Simple Picture\u2014we can also represent using\nbelief relations to boring properties or boring centered propositions.\nBut having properties or centered propositions as objects of belief\ngives us additional resources we can use to represent doxastic states\nthat resisted characterization using the Simple Picture.\n\nFor example: What\u2019s missing in ignorance cases is an interesting\ncentered belief\u2014it\u2019s a state of believing\nP for an interesting centered proposition P. In\nthe messy shopper example, Perry\u2019s realization puts him in the\nbelief relation to the property being the messy shopper (or\nto the corresponding centered-worlds proposition). In the case of the\ntwo gods, the gods are belief-related to all the right boring\nworld-occupancy properties, but they\u2019re not belief-related to\nall the right interesting properties. The manna-throwing god on the\ntallest mountain, for example, isn\u2019t belief-related to being\non the tallest mountain or throwing manna.\n\nWhat\u2019s different in difference cases is interesting centered\nbeliefs\u2014it\u2019s a difference in states of believing\nP for interesting centered propositions P. In\nthe case of John and David and the bear, John and David are both\nbelief-related to inhabiting a world in which John is being\nattacked by a bear while David looks on, but only John is\nbelief-related to being attacked by a bear, while only David\nis belief-related to being an unattacked witness to a bear\nattack. This case highlights how \u201cself-locating\u201d\nbelief isn\u2019t just about geographical self-location. On\nLewis\u2019s framework self-locating beliefs relate individuals to\nproperties of the form, being such-and-such, as opposed to\nproperties of the form, inhabiting a world in which so-and-so\nperson is such-and-such. For example, having written the\nTreatise, rather than inhabiting a world in which Hume wrote\nthe Treatise. (Annoying complication: we need to qualify and\nrestrict to values of such-and-such where it\u2019s a\ncondition that\u2019s not necessarily satisfied by all individuals in\na world at all times if it\u2019s satisfied by any individual in that\nworld at any time.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the same in sameness cases is interesting centered\nbeliefs\u2014it\u2019s a similarity in states of believing\nP for interesting centered propositions P. In\nthe burning pants case, all of the people who sincerely exclaim\n\u201cmy pants are on fire!\u201d (and are disposed towards the\nassociated non-verbal behaviors) are belief-related to having\nburning pants. Hume and Heimson are both belief-related to\nbeing Hume, and to having written the Treatise.\n\nThis will generalize to the non-doxastic attitudes as well\u2014if we\ntake the objects of propositional attitudes generally to be properties\nor centered-worlds propositions, we can handle the cases of\nsimilarities and differences in desire (etc.) that resisted\ncharacterization in terms of attitudes toward possible-worlds\npropositions in the same way as we handle the recalcitrant\nsimilarities and differences in belief.\n",
