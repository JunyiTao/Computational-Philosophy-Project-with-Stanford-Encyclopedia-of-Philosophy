    "main_text": "The Metasemantic Interpretation || A 2D account of assertoric content\n3.2 A 2D account of assertoric content\n\nThe metasemantic interpretation of the 2D framework was originally\ndeveloped as a way of explaining how the propositions conveyed by the\nassertion of a sentence can vary depending on the conversational\ncontext (Stalnaker 1978). In this seminal paper, Stalnaker proposes an\nattractive theoretical account of the role of assertion in a\nconversation, which is then used to explain how the assertoric use of\na necessary sentence like \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019, can\nconvey a specific empirical proposition within a given conversation.\nIn particular, Stalnaker argues that our commitment to construing such\nsentences as making felicitous and informative assertions will lead us\nto reinterpret their content in ways that can be modeled\nusing the 2D framework.\n\nThe guiding idea is that in making an assertion the speaker is trying\nto get the audience to rule out certain possibilities. In asserting\n\u2018It\u2019s cold today\u2019, for instance, I may be trying to\nget you to rule out possibilities in which today\u2019s temperature\nin Melbourne is over 10\u00b0 C. We can model what my assertion\nconveys, then, as a function that maps possible worlds in which\ntoday\u2019s temperature is under 10\u00b0 C to True and all other\nworlds to False. However, the precise truth-conditions communicated by\nan assertoric use of a sentence depend in part on the conversational\ncontext in which it takes place. Just which temperatures count as\ncold, for instance, depends on shared background assumptions in a\nparticular conversational context: what\u2019s cold in Melbourne is\nmild in Manitoba.\n\nA second guiding idea is that the proposition actually conveyed by the\nassertion of a particular sentence depends on presuppositions\nshared by the participants in the conversation\u2014including\npresuppositions about what particular words represent and\npresuppositions about actual empirical circumstances. If you\u2019re\na Chinese speaker who doesn\u2019t understand anything at all about\nwhat the term \u2018cold\u2019 represents in English, then I cannot\nuse \u2018It\u2019s cold today\u2018 to convey facts about\nMelbourne\u2019s weather. And if you\u2019re a Canadian who\ndoesn\u2019t understand anything about Australian weather conditions,\nyou won\u2019t understand precisely what I am saying to my fellow\nMelburnians when I assert that sentence. Stalnaker calls the set of\npresuppositions that conversational partners treat as common knowledge\nthat they can rely on to get their point across the \u201ccontext\nset\u201d\u2014which he models as the set of possible worlds that\nsatisfy all of these mutual presuppositions. The context set will\nencode shared assumptions about the meaning of words, about general\nempirical facts, about the what\u2019s happened so far in the\nconversation, and so on.\n\nThe goal of assertion, Stalnaker suggests, is to shrink the context\nset. In making an assertion, the speaker tries to get the audience to\naccept a new proposition as one of their shared presuppositions,\nthereby shrinking the set of possible worlds that are considered live\noptions. For instance, in asserting \u2018It\u2019ll be very cold\ntoday\u2019 to a group of Melburnians, I exploit background knowledge\nof local weather conditions in June to get my audience to accept that\nthe temperature outside is somewhere between 5\u201310\u00b0 C, ruling\nout live possibilities that it might be in the 15\u201320\u00b0 C\nrange. If all goes well, further planning will proceed on the basis of\na smaller and more accurate range of possibilities. In contrast, if I\nwere to assert \u2018It\u2019s cold\u2019 to the monolingual\nChinese speaker or to the parochial Canadian, my assertion would be\ndefective, since my audience wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out\nwhich temperatures are ruled out by my assertion.\n\nIdentity claims, however, do not seem to fit this simple model of\nassertion. As Kripke (1980) argued, identities are either necessarily\ntrue or necessarily false. So accepting an identity will either leave\nthe context set unchanged or it will eliminate it altogether. Either\nway, asserting an identity would be pointless. But clearly it is not.\nAsserting an identity such as \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019\ncan be genuinely informative, ruling out empirical possibilities\npreviously taken to be live options. According to the metasemantic\naccount, (i) the goal of assertion can explain why the assertion of a\nnecessary sentence will lead to a reinterpretation of the content of\nthe asserted sentence, and (ii) the 2D framework helps to specify just\nwhich proposition will be conveyed by the sentence within a given\nconversation.\n\nIn general, an identity claim is appropriate when one of the parties\nto a conversation is (partially) ignorant about which object is picked\nout by a name like \u2018Lloyd\u2019. For an externalist like\nStalnaker, this is a case of semantic ignorance. If\nO\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know that \u2018Lloyd\u2019 is\nco-referential with \u2018I.L. Humberstone\u2019, then he does not\nfully understand the semantic rules governing these names: i.e., that\nboth names are associated with a constant function from any possible\nworld to a specific individual. But O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t utterly\nincompetent with the meaning of these terms: he implicitly understands\nboth names as rigid designators, and he has some substantive\nunderstanding of the object each name picks out. For instance, he may\nunderstand that \u2018Lloyd\u2019 refers to the person to whom\nhe\u2019s just been introduced and that \u2018I.L.\nHumberstone\u2019 refers to the author of \u2018Direction of\nFit\u2019. O\u2019Leary\u2019s semantic deficiency\u2014his\nfailure to fully understand the meaning of these names in a\ncontextually appropriate way\u2014is grounded in his ignorance of the\nordinary empirical fact that the man to whom he has been introduced is\nthe author of \u2018Direction of Fit\u2019.\n\n2D matrices can be used to represent this sort of partial semantic\nunderstanding. O\u2019Leary knows that \\(if\\) the man in front of him\nis the author of the famous article, then \u2018Lloyd = I.L.\nHumberstone\u2019 expresses a necessary truth; and he knows that\n\\(if\\) the man in front of him isn\u2019t the author, the sentence\nexpresses a necessary falsehood. What O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know\nis which of these two possibilities corresponds to his actual\nsituation. Call the first possibility i and the\nsecond j. O\u2019Leary\u2019s epistemic situation\ncan then be summed up in a 2D matrix:\n\nO\u2019Leary: \u2018Lloyd = I.L. Humberstone\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\ni\nj \n\ni\nT\nT \n\nj\nF\nF  \n\n\n\nThe matrix is defined only with respect to a specific set of relevant\nalternative possibilities, i and j,\nchosen in such a way as to reflect the\nsubjects\u2019 semantic understanding and our own explanatory\ninterests. The vertical axis represents these possible worlds in their\nrole as contexts of use, which determine the literal semantic\ncontent of the expressions used in them. The horizontal axis\nrepresents those same possible worlds as circumstances of\nevaluation, relative to which we evaluate the truth or falsity of\nthe proposition expressed. Each row of the matrix thus represents a\ndifferent proposition that might be literally expressed by the\nsentence. Stalnaker calls such matrices propositional\nconcepts, since they reflect the subject\u2019s current\nimperfect conception of the meaning of the\n sentence.[22]\n This particular matrix reflects the fact that O\u2019Leary\u2019s\ncurrent epistemic state is compatible with the identity sentence\nexpressing either a necessary truth or a necessary falsehood,\ndepending on empirical facts about the actual context of use.\n\nWhat does O\u2019Leary learn when he comes to accept Daniels\u2019\nassertion of \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019? Since the actual\nworld is like i, the literal semantic content of\nthe asserted sentence is a necessary truth. But necessary truths rule\nout no empirical possibilities whatsoever, so this cannot be the\ninformative proposition that is conveyed by Daniels\u2019 assertion.\nMoreover, O\u2019Leary is not in a position to recognize that this is\nthe literal semantic content of the sentence, since he doesn\u2019t\nknow whether the actual world is like i or j.\nThe natural suggestion is that the information\nconveyed by Daniels\u2019 assertion is that the real world is like\ni and not j. When O\u2019Leary\naccepts \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019, he will no longer\ntreat the possibility that the man in front of him is not the\nauthor of the famous article as a live option: this empirical\npossibility will be eliminated from his context set. Thus, the\nproposition that seems to be conveyed by Daniels\u2019 assertion\ncorresponds to the diagonal intension determined by our 2D matrix for\nthat assertion. Moreover, this observation generalizes: when subjects\nare partially ignorant of the semantic values of their words, the\ndiagonal proposition determined by the propositional concept can\ncapture the empirical information conveyed by the assertion.\n\nBut why is this so? To explain why assertions sometimes express the\ndiagonal proposition, the metasemantic account appeals to rational\nmaxims governing conversational cooperation. The following maxim seems\nto govern the practice of assertion:\n\nThe very same proposition should be expressed relative to every\npossible world in the context set. (Stalnaker 1978, 88)\n\n\nSpeakers should conform to this maxim, because assertion involves an\nintention to get one\u2019s audience to eliminate worlds from the\ncontext set in accordance with the proposition expressed\u2014and in\norder for this intention to succeed the audience must be in a position\nto figure out just which worlds they are being asked to eliminate.\nWhen this sort of rational maxim governing the communication of\ninformation is flouted, the audience will look for a non-standard\ninterpretation of the utterance that would bring it back into\nconformity with the maxims (Grice 1989). [See the entries on\n pragmatics\n and on\n implicature.]\n\nAccording to Stalnaker, this is precisely what is going on in the case\nof identity claims like the one we have been considering.\nDaniels\u2019 assertion of \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019\nclearly flouts the proposed maxim. We can assume that Daniels is aware\nthat O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know whether he is in a world like\ni, where the man to whom he\u2019s been introduced\nis the famous author, or a world like j where they are distinct. Yet\nDaniels utters a sentence that expresses a different proposition\ndepending on whether the actual world is like i or\nlike j. In such circumstances, the audience should\nlook for an alternative interpretation of the assertion.\nDaniels\u2019 assertion can be brought back into conformity with the\nmaxim by re-interpreting it as conveying the proposition expressed by\nthe diagonal of the matrix. At a rough intuitive level, we can say\nthat Daniels is trying to get O\u2019Leary to accept that the\nsentence \u2018Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone\u2019 expresses a truth.\nBut the 2D framework also allows us to specify more precisely just\nwhat empirical information is conveyed within a given conversational\ncontext. Given O\u2019Leary\u2019s and Daniels\u2019 common\npresuppositions about what the two names represent, Daniels\u2019\nassertion also expresses the proposition that the man to whom\nO\u2019Leary has just been introduced is the author of\n\u2018Direction of Fit\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing, however, that the very same sentence\nasserted in a different conversational context could express an\nentirely different empirical proposition: just which proposition is\nexpressed, on this metasemantic account, depends on what the\nindividual parties to the conversation are currently presupposing\nabout the meanings of the expressions used.\n\nIn recent work, Stalnaker has enriched his notion of a context. In\naddition to a sets of possible worlds, he introduces (i) multiple\ncenters within those worlds representing the participants in a\nconversation, and (ii) accessibility relations among the centers\nrepresenting interlocutors\u2019 ways of identifying each other\n(Stalnaker 2008, 2014). This added structure is intended to capture\nself-locating presuppositions that can help explain what\u2019s\ncommunicated by indexical expressions like \u2018I\u2019,\n\u2018you\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019. For a helpful overview of the\nmotivation for such an approach, see (Ninan 2010a) and for further\ndevelopment of multi-centered accounts of propositional content see\n(Torre 2010, Ninan 2013).\n",
