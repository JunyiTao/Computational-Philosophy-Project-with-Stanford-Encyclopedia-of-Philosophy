Probabilistic Measures of Coherence\n\nWe recall that Lewis\u2019s defined coherence, or congruence, not for any\nold set of proposition but rather for a set of supposed facts\nasserted. One way to capture this idea is in terms of the notion of a\ntestimonial system introduced in Olsson (2005). A testimonial system\n\\(S\\) is a set\n\\(\\{\\langle E_1,A_1\\rangle ,\\ldots ,\\langle E_n,A_n\\rangle \\}\\)\nwhere \\(E_i\\) is a report to the effect that\n\\(A_i\\) is true. We will say that\n\\(A_i\\) is the content of report\n\\(E_i\\). The content of a testimonial system\n\\(S = \\{\\langle E_1,A_1\\rangle ,\n\\ldots ,\\langle E_n,A_n\\rangle \\}\\)\nis the ordered set of report contents\n\\(\\langle A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n\\rangle\\).\nBy the degree of coherence \\(C(S)\\) of such a testimonial\nsystem we will mean the degree of coherence of its content.\nBovens and Hartmann (2003) proposed a similar representation of\nsupposed facts asserted in terms of ordered sets.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, consider a case in which all witnesses\nreport exactly the same thing, e.g., that John was at the crime scene.\nThat would be a paradigm case of a (highly) coherent set of reports.\nNow contrast this situation with one in which only one witness reports\nthis. That would be a situation which would intuitively not qualify as\ncoherent. Indeed, it does not even seem meaningful to apply the\nconcept of coherence to a case of just one report (except in the\ntrivial sense in which everything coheres with itself). Letting\n\\(A\\) be the proposition \u201cJohn was at the crime scene\u201d,\nand \\(E_1 ,\\ldots ,E_n\\) the\ncorresponding reports, this intuitive difference can be represented as\nthe difference between two testimonial systems: \\(S = \\{\\langle E_1,A\\rangle ,\\ldots ,\\langle E_n ,A\\rangle \\}\\) and\n\\(S' = \\{\\langle E_1,A\\rangle \\}\\). If, by\ncontrast, the entities to which coherence applies are represented as\nsimple unstructured sets, the sets of testimonies in question would be\ngiven the same formal representation in terms of the set having\n\\(A\\) as its sole member.\n\nBy a (probabilistic) coherence measure, as defined for ordered sets of\npropositions, we shall mean any numerical measure\n\\(C(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n)\\)\ndefined solely in terms of the probability of\n\\(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n\\) (and their\nBoolean combinations) and standard arithmetical operations (Olsson,\n2002). This definition makes the degree of coherence of a set of\nwitness reports a function of the probability of the report contents\n(and their Boolean combinations). Huemer (2011, 45) refers to this\nconsequence as the Content Determination Thesis. We will return to the\nstatus of this thesis in section 8, in connection with the recent\nimpossibility results for coherence. A reasonable constraint on any\ncoherence measure is that the degree of coherence of an ordered set\nshould be independent of the particular way in which the content\npropositions are listed. Thus,\n\\(C(\\langle A_1,A_2 , \\ldots ,A_n\\rangle) = C(\\langle B_1,B_2 , \\ldots ,B_n\\rangle)\\) whenever\n\\(\\langle B_1,B_2 , \\ldots ,B_n\\rangle\\) is a permutation of\n\\(\\langle A_1,A_2 , \\ldots ,A_n\\rangle\\). This is a formal way of stating\nthat all propositions in the relevant set should be treated as\nepistemic equals. All measures that will be discussed below satisfy\nthis condition.\n\nOur starting point will be an attempt to identify the degree of\ncoherence of a set with its joint probability:\n\n\\[\nC_0 (A,B) = P(A\\wedge B)\n\\]\n\n\nHowever, it is easily seen that this is not a plausible proposal.\nConsider the following two cases. Case 1: Two witnesses point out the\nsame person as the perpetrator, John, say. Case 2: One witness states\nthat John or James did it, and the other witness that John or Mary did\nit. Since the joint probability is the same in both cases, equaling\nthe probability that John did it, they yield the same degree of\ncoherence as measured by \\(C_0\\). And yet, the reports in\nthe first case are more coherent from a presystematic standpoint\nbecause the witnesses are in complete agreement.\n\nOne way of handling this example would be to define coherence as relative overlap, in the following sense (Glass 2002, Olsson 2002):\n\n\\[\nC_1 (A,B) = \\frac{P(A\\wedge B)}\n                 {P(A\\vee B)}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(C_1 (A,B)\\), which also takes on values\nbetween 0 and 1, measures how much of the total probability mass\nassigned to either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) falls into their intersection.\nThe degree of coherence is 0 if and only if\n\\(P(A\\wedge B) = 0\\), i.e., just in case \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) do not overlap at all, and it is 1 if and only if\n\\(P(A\\wedge B) = P(A\\vee B)\\), i.e., just in case\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) coincide. The measure is straightforwardly\ngeneralizable:\n\n\\[\nC_1 (A_1 ,\\ldots A_n) =\n  \\frac{P(A_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_n)}\n       {P(A_1\\vee \\ldots \\vee A_n)}\n\\]\n\n\nThis measure assigns the same coherence value, namely 1, to all cases\nof total agreement, regardless of the number of witnesses that are\ninvolved. Against this it may be objected that agreement among the\nmany is more coherent than agreement among the few, an intuition that\ncan be accounted for by the following alternative measure introduced\nby Shogenji (1999):\n\n\\[\nC_2 (A,B) = \\frac{P(A \\mid B)}{P(A)}\n       = \\frac{P(A\\wedge B)}{P(A)\\times P(B)}\n\\]\n\n\nor, as Shogenji proposes to generalize it,\n\n\\[\nC_2 (A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n) = \n   \\frac{P(A_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_n)}{P(A_1)\\times \\ldots \\times P(A_n)}\n\\]\n\n\nIt is easy to see that this measure is sensitive, in the way we\nsuggested, to the number of reports in cases of total agreement:\n\\(n\\) agreeing reports correspond to a coherence value of\n\\(\\bfrac{1}{P(A)^{n-1}}\\), meaning that as\n\\(n\\) approaches infinity, so does the degree of coherence. Like\nthe other measures, \\(C_2 (A,B)\\) equals 0\nif and only if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do not overlap. An alternative\ngeneralization of the Shogenji measure is presented in Shupbach\n(2011). However, whatever its philosophical merits, Schupbach\u2019s\nproposal is considerably more complex than Shogenji\u2019s original\nsuggestion. Akiba (2000) and Moretti and Akiba (2007) raise a number\nof worries for the Shogenji measure and for probabilistic measures of\ncoherence generally but they seem to be predicated on the assumption\nthat the concept of coherence is interestingly applicable to unordered\nsets of propositions, an assumption that we found reason to question\nabove.\n\n\\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) can also be contrasted\nwith regard to their sensitivity to the specificity of the\npropositions involved. Consider two cases. The first case involves two\nwitnesses both claiming that John committed the crime. The second case\ninvolves two witnesses both making the weaker disjunctive claim that\nJohn, Paul or Mary committed the crime. Which pair of witnesses are\ndelivering the more coherent set? One way to reason is as follows.\nSince both cases involve fully agreeing testimonies, the degree of\ncoherence should be the same. This is also the result we get if we\napply \\(C_1\\). But one could maintain instead that since\nthe first two witnesses agree on something more specific\u2014a\nparticular individual\u2019s guilt\u2014the degree of coherence should be\nhigher. This is what we get if we apply \\(C_2\\). In an\nattempt at reconciliation, Olsson (2002) suggested that\n\\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) may capture two\ndifferent concepts of coherence. While \\(C_1\\) measures\nthe degree of agreement of a set, \\(C_2\\) is more\nplausible as a measure of how striking the agreement is.\n\nRecently, however, Koscholke and Schippers (2015) have noted a\ncounterintuitive feature of \\(C_1\\): that it is impossible to increase\na set\u2019s degree of coherence by adding further propositions to\nthe set. They also show that according to a more sophisticated\nrelative overlap measure which avoids this issue no set\u2019s degree\nof coherence exceeds the degree of coherence of its maximally coherent\nsubset. On the other hand, they also prove in a later article, in\ncollaboration with Stegman, that there is a further relative overlap\nmeasure which avoids both these problems and which therefore in their\nview re-establishes relative overlap as a candidate for a proper\nformalization of coherence (Koscholke, Schippers and Stegman,\n2019).\n\nA further much discussed measure is that proposed in Fitelson (2003).\nIt is based on the intuition that the degree of coherence of a set\n\\(E\\) should be \u201ca quantitative, probabilistic generalization\nof the (deductive) logical coherence of \\(E\\)\u201d (ibid., 194).\nFitelson takes it to be a consequence of this idea that a maximum\n(constant) degree of coherence is attained if the propositions in\n\\(E\\) are all logically equivalent (and consistent). This is in\naccordance with \\(C_1\\) but not with\n\\(C_2\\), which as we saw is sensitive to the specificity\n(prior probability) of the propositions involved. Fitelson, who\napproached the subject from the standpoint of confirmation theory,\nproposed a complex coherence measure based on Kemeny and Oppenheim\u2019s\n(1952) measure of factual support. A further innovative idea is that\nFitelson extends this measure to take into account support relations\nholding between all subsets in the set \\(E\\), whereas\nLewis, we recall, only considered the support relation holding between\none element and the rest. The degree of coherence of a set, finally,\nis defined as the mean support among the subsets of \\(E\\). An\nalleged counterexample to this measure can be found in Siebel (2004)\nand criticisms and proposed amendments in Meijs (2006). The reader may\nwish to consult Bovens and Hartmann (2003), Douven and Meijs (2007),\nRoche (2013a) and Shippers (2014a) for further coherence measures and\nhow they fare in relation to test cases in the literature, and\nKoscholke and Jekel (2017) for an empirical study of coherence\nassessments drawing on similar examples. The latter study indicates\nthat the measures by Douven and Meijs and by Roche are more in line\nwith intuitive judgement than other established measures. Some recent\nworks have focused on applying coherence measures to inconsistent\nsets, e.g., Schippers (2014b) and Schippers and Siebel (2015).\n\nIt is fair to say that coherence theorists have yet to reach anything\nlike consensus on how best to define coherence in probabilistic terms.\nNevertheless, the debate so far has given rise to a much more\nfine-grained understanding of what the options are and what\nconsequences they have. What is more, some quite surprising\nconclusions can be drawn even with this issue largely unresolved: all\nwe need to assume in order to prove that no coherence measure can be\ntruth conducive, in a sense to be explained, is that those measures\nrespect the Content Determination Thesis.\n",
