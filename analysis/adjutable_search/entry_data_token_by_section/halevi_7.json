    "main_text": "The Problem of Creation vs. the Eternity of the World\n8. The Origin of the Jewish Religion and the Theophany at Sinai\n\n\nHalevi's treatment of the theophany at Sinai presents a\nremarkably rich, nuanced, yet compact summary of familiar themes in the\nbiblical accounts of this axial event, set within the context of the\nliberation from bondage. At the same time, it links up with other\nsignificant themes already discussed or elaborated on later in the\ndialogue. Following a brief discussion of what we can know about\nnature, causation, and divine agency, (K 1:68\u201379) the king asks the\nsage to tell him how his religion developed and spread beyond its point\nof origin, how it overcame internal dissension to achieve unity, and\nhow it eventually became well established. From the question itself, it\nis obvious that the king conceives of Judaism's emergence in\npurely naturalistic terms, akin to what the sage had previously\nidentified as a syllogistic, governmental religion. Much to his\nsurprise, however, the sage asserts that only man-made\nnomoi (laws) arise in this way, while\na nomos that has its origin\nin God arises suddenly. On being told to be, it obediently came into\nbeing, just like the creation of the world. The king confesses to being\nawestruck by this unexpected declaration, although it is unclear\nwhether he is more impressed by the miraculous suddenness of what is\nclaimed or the element of obedience associated with it.\n\nHalevi builds upon this ambiguity as the sage proceeds to describe the\nremarkable loyalty, courage, cohesiveness, and sheer endurance of the\nHebrew slaves. He traces their path out of the humiliation and misery\nof Egyptian slavery to their ultimate deliverance under the leadership\nof Moses and Aaron, amidst miraculous plagues announced in advance. He\ngoes on to recount their subsequent rescue at the sea and, finally, the\nbeginning of their journey into the wilderness of Sinai. Although the\nsage matter-of-factly characterizes the story as lengthy and\nwell-known, the king's response registers its intended effect. He\nsays that this is truly the divine order at work, since no doubt about\nthese events having come about through magic, subterfuge or imagination\ngrips the heart. While his informal survey of\npossible explanations is by no means exhaustive, it does underscore the\npeople's belief that their God can indeed do whatever he wishes\nwhenever he wishes\u2014at least within the parameters of the story as\ntold thus far. However, it does not dispel either their doubt or the\nking's own doubt as to whether God enters into contact with flesh\nand blood. Halevi makes it clear that the theophany at Sinai was\nintended to resolve that doubt once and for all. (K\n1:80\u201387)\n\nIn the first of the discussion's three phases, the nature of this\npersistent doubt is explained. The people are convinced that speaking\nis a corporeal phenomenon, presumably because physical organs are\nneeded both to produce and to apprehend the sounds and a physical\nmedium such as air is needed to carry or convey them. But if that is\nso, speech without a flesh and blood speaker seems highly unlikely.\nYet, the people had also come to believe that God was well above the\ncharacteristics and accoutrements of flesh and blood. To remove both\nthe doubt itself and the concomitant supposition that any allegedly\ndivine Law actually had to be the result of human thought and opinion,\nthe people were instructed first to prepare inwardly and outwardly over\nthree days of great terror for the theophany to come. Significantly,\nhowever, when Halevi undertakes to describe the momentous revelation,\nhe carefully distinguishes between the events that the people\nwitnessed, on the one hand, and how they reported and transmitted what\nthey apprehended, on the other. What they actually witnessed was (1)\nlightning, thunder, earthquakes, and fires that surrounded the\nmountain; (2) Moses entering and emerging from the fire, alive; (3) the\npresentation of the Ten Commandments; and (4) the stone tablets\ninscribed with divine writing. The description is uncharacteristically\nbare of any reference to God having said or done anything and likewise\nbereft of any biblical citations to fill in the lacunae.\n\nImmediately afterwards, the sage indicates that the multitude did not\ntransmit the Ten Commandments as something declared by individuals\namong them or by a prophet, but by God. Later, when Moses had been\nasked to serve as their intermediary with God, they believed that he\nwas addressed by speech that had its origin in God, but without prior\nthought on his part. To make the point of God's involvement\nclearer still, we are told that when Moses came down from the mountain\nwith the inscribed tablets in hand, all conjectures about his having\nformulated the Ten Commandments on his own or with the help of the\nActive Intellect, or as a figment of his imagination while dreaming\nwere refuted by the theophany itself\u2014a clear invitation to\nre-examine what they witnessed\u2014and by the fact that the people\n\u201csaw them asdivine writing, just as\nthey heard them as divine\nspeech.\u201d (K1:87; italics added) Given the fact that Halevi was an\naccomplished poet and sensitive to the nuances of language, there is\nevery reason to suppose that he knew that \u201cseeing\u201d and\n\u201cseeing as\u201d do not signify the same kind of activity. The\nrelational and interpretive character of \u201cseeing as\u201d and\n\u201chearing as\u201d raises the possibility that the imagination\nmay have had at least some role in how the people understood the events\nthey witnessed, even though the only explicit reference to it thus far\ndenies it any role in what Moses experienced. By the end of this phase\nof Halevi's discussion, (K 1:87) it is clear that the skeptical\nIsraelites have at last been persuaded that God does enter into contact\nwith flesh and blood. They are plainly unanimous about what they\nexperienced and unanimous about accepting the Law as divine and\nauthoritative. From the standpoint of the king's four criteria\nfor resolving his own skepticism, the sage's account would seem\nto have addressed them all with the added prospect that political\nbenefits like stability and cohesiveness might likewise result from his\nfollowing the Israelites example. (cf. K 1: 21\u201322)\n\nIn the second phase of the discussion, (K 1: 88\u201390) the king offers two\nresponses to what he has heard, but neither one explicitly states his\nown view. The first suggests that \u201csomeone\u201d who hears all\nthat the sage described would surely be excused for supposing that Jews\nbelieve that God is corporeal. In saying this, he calls attention to a\ncommon misunderstanding many people have upon first encountering\nbiblical and rabbinic narratives relating to God. The second response\naddresses the sage, and through him the Jews generally, by allowing\nthat they, too, may be excused for rejecting reason and speculation\nbecause of the undeniable and plainly visible sights\njust related. By excusing his interlocutor and those he\nrepresents, however, the king indicates, albeit indirectly, his own\nacceptance of the evidence presented and, with it, the implication that\nexperience trumps both reason and speculation, (cf. K 1:4, 5)\napparently without qualification. This plainly ignores several of the\nmore qualified observations offered by the sage (e.g., the\n\u201cseeing\u201d/ \u201cseeing as\u201d distinction), but it also\nshows that the king has reached one of several turning points that\nculminate in his conversion to Judaism (K 2:1) and his continuing\neducation through the end of the dialogue.\n\nUnlike the king, the sage is by no means prepared to jettison reason\nand speculation altogether, even and perhaps especially in defense of\nhis faith. Thus, he invokes God's name in an informal oath, once\nagain, to forbid the acceptance of anything that the intellect regards\nas absurd or impossible, which in the case at hand would clearly apply\nto construing God as corporeal. While his oath is surely no syllogistic\nargument, it is a performative utterance to be taken with the utmost\nseriousness, especially when the strictures against taking God's\nname in vain are recalled. By speaking in this manner, the sage\nacknowledges the supremacy of the divine order in all of its senses,\nbut he does this now in defense of reason and\nrationality. Since oaths are taken, in part, to\nestablish truth in an inquiry, his purpose in taking this oath is\nevidently to base all inquiries in pursuit of the truth on the\nauthority of the Law and respect for its foundations. He illustrates\nthe point by noting that the first of the Ten Commandments mandates the\nacceptance of God's sovereignty, and his oath assuredly does\nthis. The second Commandment, in turn, forbids representing God\ncorporeally in any form. If\nso, it would be utterly absurd for the Law to presuppose what it\nprohibits (i.e., that God must be corporeal), given what the Bible\nrelates about the great theophany.\n\nOnce the religious and legal basis for reason's denial of divine\ncorporeality is established, the sage does not hesitate to offer a\nspeculative argument of his own. He presents it in the a\nfortioriform often used to interpret the Law\nand argues that if we maintain that many of God's creations are\nabove corporeality, \u201clike the rational soul, which is what man is\nin reality,\u201d how shall we not maintain that God is also above\ncorporeality? Using Moses as an example, he notes that the part of\nMoses that speaks to, understands, and governs his people is not his\ntongue, brain, or heart, which are merely organs and instruments\nbelonging to him, but rather his rational soul, which is what he really\nis. On the basis of this clearly Platonic conception of the soul, he\ngoes on to argue that, owing to the soul's incorporeality, no\nplace is too narrow for it to enter, nor is it too narrow for the forms\nof all created things to\nfind a place in it. The restriction of what the soul may eventually\nunderstand to created things is entirely consistent with the\nsage's account of the hierarchy of being. What is unexpected and\nultimately more important is that Halevi gives enormous latitude to\nwhat the soul, or, more concretely stated, philosophers and natural\nscientists, may inquire into and understand within the created world\nitself. Whatever the limits of our capacity to understand divine things\nrationally, he is certainly not an irrationalist or even an\nanti-rationalist if that is understood to mean someone who completely\nrejects inquiry and theorizing. The second phase ends with the sage\nreminding the king that we must not reject what has been transmitted\nabout the theophany, but say instead that we do not understand how\nthese events and the miraculous deliverances that accompanied them took\nplace. As noted above, \u201cwhat has been transmitted\u201d includes\nnot only Moses\u2019 reports but also the multitude's\nunderstanding and interpretation of what took place, and, insofar as\nthis, too, is preserved in the Written and Oral Law, rejecting it would\nbe tantamount to rejecting the Law itself and with it the social\ncontract that it embodies. Thus, it is not surprising that the king\naccepts all that has been said as persuasive for the purposes of\nargument.\n \n\nIn the third and concluding part of the discussion, (K 1:90) the\nsage acknowledges that he is not saying categorically that the matter\ntook place just as he described. He allows that it may have taken\nplace in an even more profound way than he can imagine. Here,\nthe sage's admission would seem to create some difficulty for\nhis earlier claim that uninterrupted tradition is as valid as direct\nobservation. (K 1: 25; 5: 14) However, it also invites his\ninterlocutor and the reader to fulfill the last of the king's\nfour requirements or criteria for overcoming his skepticism about\nrevelation, namely to study and test the evidence repeatedly, but now\nit is in order to arrive at a more profound understanding of it.\n\n\nPerhaps most unexpected of all is the sage's explicit reference to\nrole of imagination in relating events of the past. Despite his\nefforts to dismiss philosophical accounts of the imagination's role in\ndream prophecy and its mimetic function in intellectual prophecy, he\nnow accords it a role in representing decisive events from the\npast. By the time imagination reappears in Halevi's discussion of the\n\u201cinner eye\u201d of prophecy, (K 4:3) it also has a role in\nunderstanding and interpreting events, states of affairs, and the\nnatures of created things in the present. The question that remains to\nbe answered is whether the inner eye had the same function and also\nperformed that function in connection with the events associated with\nthe theophany at Sinai. Halevi does not address the issue. The most\nthat he is prepared to say is that those who witnessed those events,\nnoting especially the events' unprecedented character, were convinced\nthat they came from the Creator without intermediary, as did the\ncreation of the world itself. That is why faith in the divine Law is\nthereafter associated by the faithful with a matching faith that the\nworld, too, is God's entirely originated creation.\n",
