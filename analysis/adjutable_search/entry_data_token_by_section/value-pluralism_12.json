    "main_text": "Pluralism and Rational Choice || Practical Wisdom\n4.1 Practical Wisdom\n\nThe pluralist\u2019s most common strategy in the face of worries\nabout choices between incommensurable values is to appeal to practical\nwisdom\u2014the faculty described by Aristotle\u2014a faculty of\njudgment that the wise and virtuous person has, which enables him to\nsee the right answer. Practical wisdom is not just a question of being\nable to see and collate the facts, it goes beyond that in some\nway\u2014the wise person will see things that only a wise person\ncould see. So plural values can be compared in that a wise person will\n\u2018just see\u2019 that one course of action rather than another\nis to be taken. This strategy is used (explicitly or implicitly) by\nMcDowell (1979), Nagel (1979), Larmore (1987), Skorupski (1996),\nAnderson (1993 and 1997) Wiggins (1997 and 1998), Chappell (1998),\nSwanton (2003). Here it is in Nagel\u2019s words:\n\nProvided one has taken the process of practical justification as far\nas it will go in the course of arriving at the conflict, one may be\nable to proceed without further justification, but without\nirrationality either. What makes this possible is\njudgment\u2014essentially the faculty Aristotle described as\npractical wisdom, which reveals itself over time in individual\ndecisions rather than in the enunciation of general principles. (1979,\np. 135)\n\n\nThe main issue for this solution to the comparison problem is to come\nup with an account of what practical wisdom is. It is not easy to\nunderstand what sort of thing the faculty of judgment might be, or how\nit might work. Obviously pluralists who appeal to this strategy do not\nwant to end up saying that the wise judge can see which of the options\nhas more goodness, as that would constitute collapsing back into\nmonism. So the pluralist has to maintain that the wise judge makes a\njudgment about what the right thing to do is without making any\nquantitative judgment. The danger is that the faculty seems entirely\nmysterious: it is a kind of magical vision, unrelated to our natural\nsenses. As a solution to the comparison problem, the appeal to\npractical wisdom looks rather like way of shifting the problem to\nanother level. Thus the appeal to practical wisdom cannot be left at\nthat. The pluralist owes more explanation of what is involved in\npractical wisdom. What follows below are various pluralists\u2019\naccounts of how choice between plural values is possible, and whether\nsuch choice is rational.\n",
