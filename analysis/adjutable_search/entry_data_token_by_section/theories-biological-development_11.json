    "main_text": "Twentieth-Century Genetics: A New Predeterminism\n9. Twentieth-Century Genetics: A New Predeterminism\n\nEarly twentieth-century embryology highlighted epigenesis. But a new\ntwist on preformationism soon arose in the form of genetics. This\npointed to the nuclear chromosomes as loci for the causes of\ndifferentiation. Yet unlike Weismann and Roux, new geneticists did not\nsee the genetic material as divided up into a mosaic to explain\nensuing cell and tissue differences. Rather, the inherited nuclear\nmaterial was the same in every cell, but it acted differently\naccording to an internal program. This interpretation appealed to some\nscientists for metaphysical reasons since it focused on the material\nunits of heredity and apparently of causation. Epistemologically, it\nwas more difficult to point to evidence that inherited genes explain\ndevelopment.\n\nThis is not the place for a history of genetics, which has been\noffered many times elsewhere. The important point here is that\ngenetics brought a new form of preformationism. Instead of a\ndynamically acting organism taking its cues from the environmental\nconditions and from the way that cells interact with each cell\ndivision, the twentieth century brought a dominant and popular view\nthat has often emphasized genes as programmed to carry the information\nof heredity, which was also the information necessary to construct an\nindividual. Of course, there have been calls for alternatives or\ninteractionist models where heredity and development, epigenesis and\npreformation, work together, but these have often been offered as\nalternatives than as central interpretations (see\n Section 10).\n\nIn the beginning of the twentieth century, at first Thomas Hunt Morgan\nresisted the Mendelian-chromosome theory of inheritance that saw\ninherited units of heredity carried on chromosomes as determinants of\ndeveloped characters. If all the cells contain the same chromosomes,\nthen how can their inheritance explain anything, he asked. Instead, he\ninsisted that \u201cWe have two factors determining characters:\nheredity and the modification during development\u201d (Morgan 1910a:\n477). Morgan wrote to a friend that \u201cmy field is experimental\nembryology\u201d and not the genetics with which he became associated\n(Morgan 1908). Like his Woods Hole colleagues at the Marine Biological\nLaboratory, Morgan did not see how inherited chromosomes could explain\ndevelopment of form from non-form. He had rejected Weismann\u2019s\ninterpretations and continued to reject the idea of inherited\ndeterminants.\n\nAlso in 1910, however, he was studying many different kinds of\norganisms in pursuit of explanations of heredity as well as\ndifferentiation. A white-eyed male Drosophila fly famously caught his\nattention, and led him to the conclusion that some inherited factors\nmust, indeed, cause expression in the emerging organism (Morgan\n1910b). It is not that Morgan changed his mind about how to do\nscience, but rather that the evidence carried him in new directions\n(Maienschein 1991a).\n\nThe fertilized egg cell contains a nucleus made up of chromosomes\ninherited from both parents. Along these chromosomes are lined up\nunits of heredity that serve like Weismann\u2019s determinants, now\ncalled genes. These genes correlate with some characters in the\nresulting organism, and therefore in some sense the resulting form was\npredetermined in the egg. Yet it was not already formed. And, indeed,\nthe mere correlation of genes and characters tells us virtually\nnothing about how the differentiation occurs nor about how form\nbecomes formed (the problem of morphogenesis). Therefore, yes,\ngenetics brings a sort of new preformation or more accurately\npredeterminism. But that in itself brings a description and a\ncorrelation but no explanation. Or so Morgan initially felt, as did\nhis embryologist colleagues. Advances in genetics soon changed the\ntheoretical landscape. In 1934, Morgan posited differential gene\nactivity as the key to understanding organismal development. On his\nview, genes are inherited, their activity controlled by cytoplasmic\nfactors. The latter are originally heterogeneously distributed in the\negg. Differential gene activity so-driven leads in turn to\ndifferential cytoplasmic factor distribution, and the cycle continues,\ninfluenced by signals from a cell\u2019s environment (primarily\nneighboring cells). Ideas of preformation and epigenesis are combined\nin pre-determined genes acting in response to diverse environmental\nfactors. Burian (2005) argues that the old theoretical opposition was\nreinscribed in the disciplinary separation of embryology and genetics,\nparticularly in the US. In that context, studies of development\nemphasizing the nucleus endorsed preformationism, while those focusing\non cytoplasm and cell lineage differentiation tended to epigenesis.\nThis theoretical rift was healed when research focus shifted from\n\u201ccytoplasm vs. nucleus\u201d to mechanisms of gene expression\n(Burian 2005). Theoretical concepts grounded in genetics and molecular\nbiology thereafter increasingly dominated thinking about\ndevelopment.\n\nBy mid-twentieth century, and especially after the discovery of\nDNA\u2019s structure (which apparently also explained its function),\nresearchers began to forget or at least ignore questions about\nmorphogenesis and epigenesis (see, for example, Olby 1974, Judson\n1979). Instead they asked how, actually, genes give rise to\ndifferentiated form? Somehow that works, seemed to be the answer.\nGenetics predominated over what C.H. Waddington referred to as the\nepigenetics of development (Waddington 1942). Of course not everyone\nignored development, but it became a seriously neglected field and\neven professional societies and journals that had focused on\n\u201cembryology\u201d shifted to \u201cdevelopmental\ngenetics\u201d (Oppenheimer 1967). When Robert Briggs and Thomas King\ncloned frogs in the 1950s and John Gurdon extended the research in the\n1960s, it seemed that nuclear transfer could come from only early\nstages of development. Furthermore, the resulting clones were like\ntheir donors from whom the nuclei came rather than like the mothers\nfrom whom the eggs came (Briggs & King 1952; Gurdon & Colman\n1999; McLaren 2000). Apparently development brings differentiation\nthat is unidirectional. Preformationist/ predeterminist thinking\nprevailed. Epigenetic development and regulatory response to\nenvironmental conditions seemed to have strict limits for those\nadopting the mid-twentieth-century predeterminist emphasis.\n",
