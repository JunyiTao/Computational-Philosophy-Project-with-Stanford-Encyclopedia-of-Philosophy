    "main_text": "Definitions of \u2018_reduces to_\u2019 || Theories\n4.2 Theories\n\nThe most prominent candidates are theories. On the classical\ninterpretation, theories are sets of sentences. This suggests a\nspecific view on the reductive link: The reduction-relation is\ninstantiated when the reduced theory is syntactically derivable from\nthe reducing theory, with the help of bridge-laws. We thus get the\nfollowing definition where x is the theory being reduced,\ny is the reducing theory and z is a set of bridge\nlaws.\n\n\nTheory-Reduction I:\nx reduces to y if and only if x is a theory\n& y is a theory & \u2203z (y, z\n\u251c\nx)\n\n\nThe quantification is restricted to bridge-laws of the appropriate\nkind. A variant of this definition interprets the relata as sets of\nlaws of two theories. Nagel\u2019s homogeneous reductions\nare trivially covered (bridge-laws are irrelevant for the derivation;\nhowever, they do exist and state trivial connections not connecting\ndistinct predicates, but the very same predicate in the reduced and\nthe reducing theory). Variants of this definition include\nSchaffner\u2019s model that, in addition, mentions possible\nreplacements and catches aspects of the epistemological dimension of\nreductions, concerning the way scientists actually arrive at\nreductions (Schaffner 1993). These additional requirements might be\nregarded as imposing further constraints on the reductive link;\nhowever, especially in Schaffner\u2019s model as well as in New Wave\nmodels of reduction, these further constraints are always\ndisjunctive and seem to play the role of characterizations\nthat accompany the definition. They do not form necessary conditions\nfor reduction.\n\nDepending on how bridge-laws are characterized (epistemically,\nsemantically, metaphysically, or syntactically), a full-blown\ncharacterization of the link might or might not be a purely syntactic\naffair: If, for example, appropriate bridge-laws state\nproperty-identifications, or relations among the predicates\u2019\nextensions, then the characterization of the reductive link contains a\nmetaphysical aspect.\n\nOn a structuralist interpretation, theories are complex\nmodel-structures. Here, mapping-relations play the role derivation is\nsupposed to play on the syntactic interpretation of theories. We thus\nget (schematically, since the relevant function f is left\nunspecified):\n\n\nTheory-Reduction II:\nx reduces to y if and only if x is a theory & y\nis a theory & (f(y)=x)\n\n\nThe conditions on this function differ according to different\naccounts; however, the function is characterized solely in structural\nterms. It is supposed to capture a relevant similarity relation\nbetween the respective theories, such as a structural isomorphism\n(Suppes 1967; Sneed 1971). Moulines\u2019 criticism that this picture\nof reduction lacks an ontological link to rule out arbitrary\nreductions (Moulines 1984) reflects the idea that bridge-laws\nshouldn\u2019t be given a purely structural interpretation.\n",
