    "main_text": "Normative conceptions of the person || The Zhuangzi\n2.5 The Zhuangzi\n\nThe Zhuangzi puts the focus back on the epistemic and\nnormative (guidance) functions of the heart-mind, i.e., Mencius heart\nof \u662f\u975e shi-fei (this-not that). This reconnects\nhim with the later Mohist\u2019s theory of the norms of language/name\nuse. But his style differs and is unique. He relates insights through\nvivid and often humorous stories and metaphorical imagery.\n\nThe Zhuangzi questions the very notion of a hierarchy with\nthe heart-mind leading the rest of the person (references are to\nZhuangzi in CTP). Zhuangzi advises listening to all the\nnatural parts of one\u2019s body, of which the heart-mind is only\none. This egalitarian conception of the parts of a person puts the\nheart-mind in conversation with the rest of the body rather than in\ncommand.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s theory of cognition and guidance receives its most\nsustained, varied, and intricate expression in the second chapter,\n\u201cEqualizing Assessments of Things\u201d (Qi Wu Lun\n\u9f4a\u7269\u8ad6). Its blend of illustrations of knowing and\nof mistaking ignorance for knowing challenges interpreters to reflect\non how his theory of mind works. The opening reflection by Ziqi\n\u5b50\u7da6 starts the analysis of the heart-mind regarding the\nbody. Seemingly deep in some meditative state, Ziqi describes it as\nhaving \u201clost myself\u201d. He further explains to his\ninterlocutor using the metaphor of pipes. We know of human pipes but\nhaven\u2019t known of the pipes of earth; We\u2019ve heard the pipes\nof earth, but not yet the pipes of Tian. The Great Clump\n(earth) blows its breath, its qi, through ten thousand\nnatural hollows. When blown lightly, it generates small harmony, and\nwhen powerful, a vast and grand harmony.\n\nSo, what then are the pipes of Tian? It blows out the 10\nthousand dissimilarities and makes them one\u2019s own, along with\none\u2019s own choosing, where does the impulse arise?\n(Zhuangzi CTP: Qi Wu Lun, 1 [trans. 2009: 9]).\nZhuangzi\u2019s obscure answer has provided fuel for many\ninterpreters\u2019 employment (see entry on\n Zhuangzi).\n\nThe combative moral arguments of humans start from their choosing\ndifferent ways of marking similarity and dissimilarity in language,\ne.g., with terms like \u7fa9 yi (rightness). We speak of\ngreat and small knowing, great and small ways of speaking and even\nargue in our sleep. Waking, our heart-minds go into battle with\nfeints, deception, threats. We \u201cshoot out\u201d \u662f\nshi\u2019s (this is right) and \u975e fei\u2019s\n(No, that is wrong) like arrows from a crossbow. Then we stick to them\nas if they were covenants, As the weight of commitments grows we slow,\nweaken, fade and lose our vitality as if we were \u201c[h]eld fast as\nif bound by cords\u201d, continuing \u201calong the same\nruts\u201d. \u201cThus, the heart-mind moves closer to death, and\nnothing can restore its vitality\u201d (Zhuangzi CTP: Qi\nWu Lun, 2 [trans. 2009: 9]). Presumably the insight Ziqi reports\nas \u201closing my \u2018I\u2019\u201d concerns the cognitive and\nnormative capacity. But it views the battles with heart-minds as if\nfrom a distance. Then, pointedly avoiding attributing them to the\norgan, it introduces feelings that arise.\n\n\nJoy and anger, sorrow and happiness, plans and regrets,\ntransformations and stagnations, unguarded abandonment and deliberate\nposturing\u2014music flows out of hollows, mushrooms form from steam!\nDay and night they alternate before us, but no one knows from whence\nthey sprout. Never mind! Merely notice that they are there day and\nnight\u2026they come from somewhere. Without them there would be no\n\u201cI\u201d, and without an \u201cI\u201d nothing chosen.\n(Qi Wu Lun, 3 [trans. 2009: 10]).\n\n\nThis Hume-like reflection about the source of the \u201cI\u201d\nsuggests it is not identified with the heart-mind. The body has\n\u201chundreds of bones, nine openings and six organs\u201d, is any\nof them more \u201cI\u201d than the others? The Zhuangzi\ngoes on to muse that there must be some controller or true lord even\nif we cannot identify it. Once put together, these parts depend on\neach other as we struggle through life which passes by at a gallop.\nWe\u2019re never sure of what we\u2019ve done or if we achieve\ngoals. As the body fades, the heart-mind fades with it. Sad!\n(Ibid)\n\n\nIf we follow whatever has so far taken shape, fully formed, in our\nheart-minds, making that our teacher, who could ever be without a\nteacher? \ufeffThe historical scholar knows the times and his\nheart-mind chooses by itself. The fool does so as well. To get\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d before one\u2019s pass\nstructures someone\u2019s heart-mind \u2014that is like leaving for\nYue today and arriving yesterday. (Qi Wu Lun, 4 [trans.\nadapted from 2009: 11])\n\n\nThe heart-mind acquires its structure as it \u201cselects\u201d\n(qu \u53d6) among alternatives. This cheng xin\n\u6210\u5fc3, the fully-structured heart-mind then \u201cshoots\nout\u201d \u201cthis-right!\u201d and \u201cnot that-wrong!\u201d\nsuggests that the piping of human beings is formed on the basis of\nselecting from some this\u2019s and rejecting others. We\nacquire a conception of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d\nfrom our past practice.\n\nThe passage goes on to say, \u201cCourses are formed by walking them.\nThings are so by being called so\u201d (Qi Wu Lun, 6 [trans.\n2009: 13]). The implication is that the heart-mind\u2019s\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cthus and\nso\u201d and \u201cnot thus and so\u201d emerge within the relative\nspace or our lived worlds in which our structure was acquired by our\npast practice, our concepts of things with certain relations and\ndifferences from other things in our environment. Zhuangzi\u2019s\nview in the Qi Wu Lun is like Nelson Goodman (1978) and Iris\nEinheuser (2011). On this view, facts are not \u201cin the\nworld\u201d independently of how we conceptualize them. We carve out\nfacts from the stream of goings-on in our environment. An independent\nworld is responsible for this stream, and we systematize and structure\nit from the very small portion the world we have navigated in our time\nin that world.\n\nRecent neuroscience also fits within this Zhuangzian picture. It\nsuggests that we focus attention on only part of the overwhelming\namount of information we get from the world. We suppress conscious\nawareness of information that seems irrelevant to that focus.\n(Nakajima et al. 2019). This is how we can hear other people at our\ntable in a noisy restaurant. Once we have our concept scheme for the\nworld, we suppress alternative ways of naming (concept frameworks).\nThe natural world, independent of our concepts, does impact and\nconstrain the shape of that framework. Constellations of stars are a\nmetaphor for this process of selection. We may see a certain group of\nstars as forming a \u201cBig Dipper\u201d, but alternatively see\nthat group as part of a larger group forming a \u201cGreat\nBear\u201d, the dipper stars now forming a portion of the back half\nof the bear\u2019s torso and its tail. Such alternative parsings\ncannot produce just any range of facts. But we make the facts we make\nthrough the parsings.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s epistemology and theory of mind does not concern how\nwe represent mentally a fact that exists out in the natural world. It\nis of a scheme of navigation with concepts we project on the world to\naid us in getting about. Zhuangzi sees a similar orientation by all\nnatural creatures. They are equipped with faculties for getting on\nwith their lives. Our language-ing the world is broadly like\nbird\u2019s chirping. Both of us are seeking coherence with the\nstructure of the world in our own choices of ways to live.\n\nConstructive skepticism and substantial assertion about the world and\nhow we relate to it do not just sit side by side in this haunting\nimagery, but are intertwined. Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is\nconstructive because it does not compel us to give up on our\nconceptualization, but to recognize its overarching similarity to\nother creatures as well as other peoples with different\nlanguages\u2014systems of names. Thus, constructive skepticism is\ncompatible with substantive claims about the nature of the world as a\nwhole consisting in interdependent, fluidly interacting things that\nreact to and flow into a shared system. We become an ecosystem of\nrelated ways of life fitting this natural world. Each of us\nemerges from and returns to that greater whole, a living monism with\nreal parts. Indeed, the complexity and fluid plasticity of things is\npart of what makes the range of alternative conceptualizations of the\nworld significant and wide. The significance of this way of all being\n\u201cOne\u201d is that the world can be expected to be elusive.\n\nThe Zhuangzi expresses a keen appreciation for the\nvariability of language and conceptualization across persons and\ncommunities. People differ in the inferences that link the terms\nostensibly shared in their language. This often results in their\ntalking past each other, as is the case with the Mohists and the\nConfucians. Each shi\u2019s (affirms) what the other\nfei\u2019s (negates) and negates what the other affirms\n(Qi Wu Lun, 4). Mohists, for example, will fei\nritual practice that puts resources and human energy into rituals of\nmourning and burial that could have gone into fulfilling the needs of\nthe living, and Confucians will shi ritual practice that\nexpresses reverence and gratitude toward the deceased as cultivating\nimportant emotional dispositions of deference, yielding and gratitude\ntoward others. Mohist bring coherence into their inference relations\namong terms by making benefit and harm (li hai\n\u5229\u5bb3) central to normative conceptual scheme. Confucians\nwill bring coherence to their inferences focusing on family relations\nand fidelity to past usage and practice, deference and ritual (li\nrang \u79ae\u8b93). The mere fact that both have emerged in\nPre-Han China does not, by itself, require either side to abandon its\nscheme. But it does require that we be more modest about our own\nconstructions, even as we use them. We should recognize that our\nreasons for them are themselves derived from the scheme constructed in\nour heart-minds by past practice and exposure. We are well advised to\nbe open to how others construct their worlds and seek understanding of\nhow the others\u2019 scheme works in their way of life rather than\nwarring with or coercing them to follow what we \u201cknow\u201d in\nour way of life. \u201c\u2026 if you want to affirm what they\nnegate and negate what they affirm, nothing compares with using the\nlight (yi ming \u4ee5\u660e)\u201d (Qi Wu Lun,\n4). What does it mean to use the light?\n\nThe Zhuangzi is often interpreted as holding that there is a\nway of knowing that is not subject to skeptical doubt. This way may be\na kind of knowing-how different in kind from propositional knowledge\n(e.g., see Ivanhoe 1993; Eno 1996), or it may be a kind of mystical,\nineffable insight into the nature of things or their oneness (e.g.,\nRoth 2003). The skepticism, on this interpretation, is limited to\nskepticism about words, argument, and discursive theory (for detailed\ncriticism of these interpretations, see Chiu 2018). Given the\nelusiveness of the language in the text, it is not surprising that it\nis hard to definitively rule out the presence of a voice that speaks\nfor ineffable, unmediated access to the world as it is. The skill\npassages, however, require no such interpretation. They often\nemphasize that the skill is largely independent of language and admit\nto an inability to teach the skill to others.\n\nA modest constructive skepticism takes care not to overgeneralize\nskepticism itself. It does not require ruling out skills or\nrealization of our oneness with the world. It is, in fact, the\nlaunching point of this theory of a mind that copes with reality as it\nfinds it. The value of Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is its combination\nof cultivating one\u2019s way of structuring by appreciating\n(shedding light on) other possibilities found in nature and\nother human views. We are open to other voices in finding ways to live\ntogether in a natural unity, but also open to the limitations of these\nother voices. No performative author (including tian) makes\none of these lives required. They are real world, practical options.\nWe, the audience, are left to make up our minds, as would be in the\nspirit of constructive skepticism!\n\nMoreover, Zhuangzi even hesitates to definitively affirm ways of\nliving (if that means not dying).\n\n\n\ufeffHow, then, do I know that delighting in life is not a\ndelusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like an orphan\nwho left home in youth and no longer knows the way back? (Qi Wu\nLun, 12 [trans. 2009: 19])\n\n\nAnd later,\n\n\n\ufeffWhile dreaming you don\u2019t know it\u2019s a dream. You\nmight even interpret a dream in your dream\u2014and then you wake up\nand realize it was all a dream. \ufeffPerhaps a great awakening\nwould reveal all of this to be a vast dream. (Qi Wu Lun, 12\n[trans. 2009: 19])\n\n\nConsider perception. In the opening story of the first chapter,\n\u201cFree and Easy Wandering\u201d (Xiao Yao You\n\u900d\u9059\u904a) we encounter an enormous bird named Peng\nflying 90,000 miles up. Is \u201cthe blue on blue\u201d of the sky\nis its true color or is it the distance that makes it look that way\n(Xiao Yao You, 1). When Peng looks down, he sees only this\nearth. We, looking around on earth, see much more detail. Smaller\ncreatures, a cicada and fledgling dove, who struggle to make it from\nthe sandalwood to the elm tree, and they wonder what Peng up to 90,000\nmiles in the air and head south for. These creatures illustrate that\ntheir size and powers determine their Umwelten\u2014the\nworlds of their aspirations and ways of guiding their behavior (von\nUexk\u00fcll 2010). Each kind of organism lives in a world shaped by\ntheir distinctive capacities. Each organism \u201cselects\u201d from\nthe plethora of possibilities in the world, the possible paths to its\nfuture given its size, powers and needs (see Cantor 2020 for a similar\ntake on the \u201cHappy Fish\u201d story in chapter 17,\n\u201cAutumn Floods\u201d Qiushui \u79cb\u6c34\nchapter).\n\nDifferent creatures \u201cfit\u201d their environment in different\nways. People eschew sleeping in damp places, unlike eels. People fear\nliving in trees, unlike monkeys. Which of these creatures\n\u201cknows\u201d the right place to live? Different creatures want\nto eat different things. Each is attracted to creatures of their own\nkind and not to other kinds. The passage concludes,\n\n\nFrom where I see it, the transitions of Humanity and Responsibility\nand the trails of right and wrong are hopelessly tangled and confused.\nHow could I know how to distinguish which is right among them? (Qi\nWu Lun, 11 [trans. 2009: 18])\n\n\nIf the point of these observations about various animals were a fairly\nsimple relativism to the effect that each picks out the features of\nthe environment that is the most relevant to their size, needs, and\npowers, there need be no skeptical thrust. Differences in what is\nright for each type of creature need not pose problems for the\nprospects of gaining knowledge. Yet the passage ends with the\ndeclaration that the trails of right and wrong are hopelessly tangled\nand confused. The point instead is that different animals are\ninevitably partial in selecting the features of the environment that\nare the most suitable given their size, needs, and powers. The\nUmwelt of an animal is likely to leave out features of the\nworld that are not so relevant to its needs, and maybe some features\nare out of reach entirely from the creature\u2019s powers of\nunderstanding and perception.\n\nRight before this relativist passage, Nie Que asked Wang Ni if he\nknows what all creatures agree on affirming. He demurs \u201chow\nwould I know that!\u201d \u201cdo you knows what you do not\nknow?\u201d Same answer (Qi Wu Lun, 11). This illustrates\nthat the sort of skepticism in play here. It is not a complete denial\nof knowing that dooms any attempt at discovery. Modest, constructive\nskepticism encourages discovery. In the first chapter, Zhuangzi\nchastises Huizi for being unimaginative in using a huge gourd. Why had\nhe not thought of making it into a boat? That Huizi stopped trying to\nfind a use for an unconventionally large gourd because he only had\nconventional uses for it in his mind meant that he still had a lot of\ntangled weeds clogging up his mind (Xiao Yao You, 6 [trans:\nZiporyn 2009: 7).\n\nThe tone of skepticism here arises from our treating conventional\nknowledge as final. This skeptical stance is constructive in two ways.\nFirst, the prospect of overturning received ideas is greeted with\ndelight. We can do this by learning to take the perspectives of\nothers, human and non-human.\n\nLearning is using one\u2019s capacities to increase know-how. An\nessential part of learning is practice. When the dao of our\ninner parts, our li, is coherent with a dao in our\nenvironment, we can achieve extraordinary skills. Skill learning\ninvolves the entire body. Such sublime exercise is described with\nZhuangzi\u2019s usual skill with words in \u201cThe Primacy of\nNurturing Life\u201d (Yangsheng zhu\n\u990a\u751f\u4e3b) chapter. Zhuangzi describes the coordination\nof his hand, foot, shoulder, and knee as he carved the ox\u2014like\nperforming an elegant dance\u2014even the sounds of the cutting,\nflopping, ripping were like the musical accompaniment. The artist,\nCook Ding, replies to a ruler\u2019s praise of his elegant dance-like\nbutchering, that what he values is dao through which his\nskill advances. When he first began butchering, he saw only the oxen.\nAfter three years, he never again saw the ox as whole. Now his\n\u201cspirit\u201d (shen \u795e) guides rather than his\neyes depending on natural lines (Tianli \u5929\u7406)\ndividing its joints and spaces (Yang Sheng Zhu, 2).\n\nThree years of practice led to a changing conception of his\nperformance as a natural way through the path structure in the ox. He\nno longer self-consciously performs the constituent behaviors, but\nfocuses on the dao and li of his movements and the\nenvironment. He is totally absorbed and yet performs in relaxed joyous\nease. His body knows the way; no Cartesian pilot in the head directs\nit.\n\nRecent work on human embodied activity reflects Zhuangzi\u2019s\ndescription of elevated skills. Sean Gallagher (2005) has written\nabout the way embodiment of know-how shapes our \u201cbody\nschemas\u201d, the sensory-motor capacities that give us a sense of\nour bodies in space. When we close our eyes and raise an arm, our body\nschemas enable us to know exactly where our arm is located. Our body\nschemas become engaged with the environment to help us accomplish our\ntask. When we get good at using these available things as tools, they\nin effect become part of our body schemas, at least in that context\n(see also Barrett 2011: 200).\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s reflections on this kind of knowing invariably\nincludes notice of its defects and limitations. The modest skepticism\nthat motivates being open to further advancing know-how remains for\nCook Ding. When he comes to a difficult spot in the ox, he pauses and\nfocuses, looking carefully at the point of difficulty, and carefully,\ncautiously, goes at cutting the knot. The experiential immersion in a\nlearned behavior never reaches absolute or total perfection, the flow,\nno matter how advanced, always possible to improve or achieve with\ngreater ease and satisfaction.\n\nFurther, even great skill may not amount to an ability to teach\nothers. The wheelwright of the \u201cHeaven\u2019s Way\u201d\n(Tian Dao\u5929\u9053) chapter says he cannot pass onto\nhis son the right way to chisel a wheel, and likens his situation to\nthe ancients who left their words in texts but not what they\naccomplished and how\u2014know-how that died with them (Tian\nDao, 9).\n\nHumans learn complex patterns of motor responses involved in playing\nmusical instruments and driving cars, in which the acquired knowledge\nis not fully accessible to discursive awareness (Clegg, DiGirolamo,\n& Keele 1998), and much of the way we learn language, especially\nthe first language, is natural programming. (Cleeremens, Destrebecqz,\n& Boyer 1998; Reber 1967, 1989). When intuitive know-how or\nability is unconsciously learned, conscious monitoring of performance\ncan be a matter of degree. Learning skilled motor responses involve\nbeing guided by kinesthetic feelings\u2014e.g., walking on two feet.\nKnowing how to ride a bicycle is notoriously persistent as\n\u201csecond nature\u201d. The same applies to navigating the\ninternet, playing an instrument, reading the emotions and body\nlanguage of others (Rosenthal et al. 1979; Edwards: 1998; Lewicki\n1986), or, as Zhuangzi notes, Hui Shi\u2019s philosophical\nreflections (Qi Wu Lun 7). Propositional knowledge is easily\nexplained as activation of an acquired capacity to formulate an answer\nto a question with \u201ckinesthetic\u201d sense of confidence in\nour performance. (Cohen et al. 1990; Dimitrovsky 1964; Rosenthal et\nal. 1979)\n\nZhuangzi links his theory of how learning cheng (shapes) the\nbody and heart-mind and what he calls \u201cfasting the\nheart-mind\u201d (Ren Jian Shi 1). The text advises Yan Hui\nto fast (zhai \u9f4b) his heart-mind in advising a violent\nruler. In interacting with him, Yan must listen with the heart-mind\nrather than with the ears, but not just with the heart-mind but\nlistening with his bodily qi:\n\n\nFor the ears are halted at what they hear. The [heart-]mind is halted\nat whatever verifies its preconceptions. But the vital energy is an\nemptiness, a waiting for the presence of beings. (Ren jian\nshi, 2 [trans. adapted from 2009: 26])\n\n\nOne may have a strategy, but its implementation must respond to the\nwhole situation.\n\nHaving the heart-mind involved the way it was in learning after the\nperformance has become bodily, second-nature motor memory, may\nactually impinge on performance flow. (Lieberman 2000: 121; McDonald\n& White 1993; Packard et al. 1989; Rauch et al. 1995; Fletcher et\nal. 2005). Thus, the relation between heart-mind\u2019s engaging in\nlearning and intuitive flow and bodily performance is complex. Thought\nfocused on method can also take over when intuitive performance hits a\nproblematic spot, as in Cook Ding\u2019s difficult spot in the ox. At\nother times, it can be better to suspend the heart-mind\u2019s\njudging in favor of sensitive responsive processing because the two\ncan interfere with one another. If there is sometimes competition\nbetween the disciplined learning and practice and the immediate\nprocessing of the complexities of a situation of performance,\nZhuangzi encourages fasting the heart-mind and\nresponding with one\u2019s whole qi.\n\nZhuangzi thus rejects Mencius\u2019 hierarchical conception\nof the person with the heart-mind in control of all behavior. The\nwhole body works together, and the role of the heart-mind may fit (as\nin learning and practice) or distract. When Confucius advises Yan Hui\nto fast his mind it is in the context of his going into a dangerously\ncomplex environment which demands totally alert focus on minute\ndetails of the situation. Moral lecturing and strategic manipulation\nof the ruler may have a counter-productive effect. More fundamentally,\nthe appeal is to the deliberative mind to recognize how elusive the\ncomplex and changing world is, and to take seriously the possibility\nthat it is tapping into just a sliver of the information coming in\nfrom that world.\n\nSome link Zhuangzi\u2019s \u201cfasting the heart-mind\u201d to\nmeditation. Certain forms of meditation may increase one\u2019s\ncapacity for attentiveness to features of the present situation,\nincluding cues as what others are thinking and feeling. There is some\nevidence that it increases attentional focus and cognitive\nflexibility. (Cahn & Polich 2006; Davidson et al. 2003; Moore\n& Malinowski 2009; Moore et al. 2012; Siegel 2007; but see\nHartkamp & Thornton 2017 for a negative result). \u201cBe\ncognitively flexible\u201d is in part the message of the stories of\nHuizi\u2019s gourds and the trainer\u2019s alternative offer of\nchestnuts to his monkeys, and the heart-mind might be able to learn it\nthrough meditation. Chan Buddhism or Zen has a complex theory of this\nwhich some link to fasting the mind.\n\nThis distinction between the conscious deliberative heart-mind as such\nand the heart-mind that is rigidly committed to certain\nconceptualizations of the world is used by advocates of combining\nConfucian with Daoist approaches to decision-making and epistemic\ninquiry. They see the Zhuangzi as affirming or approving of\nconscious deliberation as a learned process. When Confucius presents\nYan Hui with a dao or way of \u201cfasting the\nheart-mind\u201d, they engage in conscious, deliberative discussion\ngoverned by training-induced pathways in their brains.\n\nWhen Cook Ding employs caution upon encountering a complicated place\nin the ox, his conscious, deliberative heart-mind is taking over\ncontrol from the first-order heart-mind. Zhuangzi\u2019s\nadvice on the organs taking turns in guiding the body, operates on a\nmeta or second-order level. It is advice about how to prepare oneself\nto make quick, selectively precise and perceptively sensitive\ndecisions on a first-order level (Kahneman 2011). The training takes\nplace on the second level, the deliberative, cognitive level. One may\nbe advised to turn off the second-level, meta-dao in a\nreal-time. If you can\u2019t recognize an ox when you see one, you\nwon\u2019t recognize the words we used in teaching you a dao\nfor butchering one. Thus, Cook Ding underwent three years of study and\npractice after which he didn\u2019t have to rehearse his lessons to\ndistinguish and divide the thigh joint from the femur. He saw the\nanimal as a composition of its natural parts. He goes about carving at\nthe first level.\n\nA later Confucian, Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529 see entry on\n Wang Yangming)\n influenced by Daoist theory, argued that we go about learning to do\nsecond order deliberation at a first order level. We are, that is,\nnatural learners. Cook Ding went about learning to carve, but now\nhe\u2019s learning to practice in a different context, the\nking\u2019s palace. He learned a dao of carving an ox as Hui\nShi learned his discursive deliberative, deliberative, rhetorical\nteaching style. Both gradually came to shift from deliberate learning\nthrough practice to fast, first-order responsiveness.\n\nLater Chinese inheritors of the Laozi and the\nZhuangzi would as enthusiastically embrace teach and learning\nlogic and scientific method. Yan Fu (1854\u20131921) saw science and\nlogic as a dao of learning about natural dao.\nMetaphorically, he treated evolution as our natural dao.\nSimilarly, Jin Yuelin (1895\u20131984) taught mathematical logic at\nTsing Hua university modernized Zhuangzi\u2019s Daoism.\nNothing in Zhuangzi\u2019s conception of naturalism rules out being\ntrained in a dao of logic to use in guiding first-order\ndeliberative, discursive interactions with others.\n",
