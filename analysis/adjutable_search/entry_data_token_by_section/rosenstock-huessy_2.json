    "main_text": "Speech, Time, History\n3. Speech, Time, History\n\nIn Ja und Nein, a work written a little over four years\nbefore his death, Rosenstock-Huessy thanked Georg M\u00fcller for\nhaving summed up seven decades of thought in the three words: speech,\ntime, history. \u2018I seem\u2019 he says \u2018to have pursued the\ndaily life of peoples and their members as reflections of this\ntrinity. I have looked at the speech of individuals and nations, the\ntimes of lovers and haters, the history of empires, the church and\nsociety as the reflections of the divine trinity\u2019 (1968, 9).\nThese three terms not only sum up the orientation of\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s life work, they also provide the key to\nunderstanding where he thinks philosophy has gone wrong.\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, speech\u2019s significance was not to describe a\nlitany of factual statements about the world of the sort \u2018it is\nraining\u2019\u2014see \u201cEs Regnet oder die Sprache steht\nauf dem Kopf\u201d in Die Sprache des\nMenschengeschlects). Nor is it, as Saussure held, simply a means\nof A expressing his or her intention to B. Moreover,\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s interest in speech is restricted to what he calls,\nin The Origins of Speech, \u2018authentic speech\u2019.\nThis is not the kind of speech which has its parallels in the animal\nkingdom. Authentic speech is the foundation and perpetuation of\nconstitutions and institutions\u2014social acts that reach across\ngenerations and establish patterns of social complexity which show us\nthe difference in our self- and world-making and that of animals.\n\nWe exist in a social reality which has been made by others and which\nwe make for others. And thus speech gives us a plasticity which\nseparates us from other animals and which enables us to work with time\nand space like no other species familiar to us. Speech is the way that\nwe reorganize the universe (1970a, 19).\n\n\nNo language is communication with others only, it is communication\nwith the universe. We try by speaking to communicate our experience of\nthe universe to our fellow men; by listening, reading, learning, we\ntry to get hold of their experience of the universe. To speak means to\nreenact cosmic processes so that these processes may reach others. In\nevery sentence, man acts within the cosmos and establishes a social\nrelation for the sake of saving the cosmos from wasting acts in vain.\nMan economizes the cosmic processes by making them available to all\nother men. Man, by speech, establishes the solidarity of all men for\nthe acceptance of our universe (1970a, 122\u2013123).\n\n\nThat solidarity is ultimately historical, for it is only by being able\nto draw upon the powers of the past and future that the human being\ncan survive the crises of their present. Thus speech and history form\nan indissoluble connection. As he says, \u2018Language is the vehicle\non which history invades the animal life of man. And the study of\nhistory and the study of language are one and the same study\u2019\n(1943, 173).\n\nSpeech, then, is a responsive and creative act in which we discover\nthings about ourselves, each other, and the world itself which we\nwould never have chanced upon had we not the power to reframe the\nuniverse through speech\u2014speech accounts for our unpredictable\nnature. And a large part of Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s objection to\nnaturalism is that either it ignores speech completely and reduces us\nto more basic animal or physical processes, or, if it does take\naccount of speech, it places speech on the same continuum as animal\ncries and calls.\n\nThe social character of speech also means that it is not only a matter\nof what is being said when we speak to one another, but also who is\ntalking to whom\u2014what a parent says to a child, a president to\nhis or her people, what friends say to one another. As he writes in\nJa und Nein:\n\nIn speech it is not a matter of what I think about myself, or even\njust what I say, rather it\u2019s a matter of how we address each other\nreciprocally. We don\u2019t speak, as the semanticists declare, to\nunderstand something. We speak, so that each understands the other\nthrough the manner that we address him and we ourselves through the\nway he address us. Each man proceeds thus: A false address can\nirritate someone for the entire day. Because speech comes into the\nworld in order to ensure that your representation of me, and mine of\nyou, is situated in the right places in the cosmos (1968, 23).\n\n\nThis one example shows how Rosenstock-Huessy differs from Saussurian\nlinguistics which break up the world into the units of language\nirrespective of how language circulates socially. It also shows how\nfar removed Rosenstock-Huessy is from the naturalistic based\nphilosophical models which see the world as an object to be\nunderstood. For Rosenstock-Huessy, the truth of the world we\nparticipate in\u2014which includes the panoply of names and concepts\nand theories which we ascribe to nature\u2014could never have been\n\u2018noticed\u2019 by a disinterested scientific spectator some\nthree thousand years ago because it wasn\u2019t there yet. It takes time\nfor us and our truths to become created and revealed to us and speech\nis the power of disclosing ourselves to each other, and ourselves, in\npart through our respective roles which enable us to preside over a\nparticular domain of \u2018powers\u2019. Speech takes and makes\ntime. In an important sense, for Rosenstock-Huessy, speech is\nrevelation which is, in turn, orientation (which is also a process of\nmutual development):\n\nThe double character of revelation consists in the way in which it\nallocates to the speaker as much as to the people whom the speaker\nsees before him, a new and at the same time a determined\nplace...revelation is orientation. Orientation is a correlation\nbetween at least two new poles; one may call it a\n\u2018correspondence\u2019, because this relationship between two\nletter writers is today more likely to be understood than between two\nspeakers. In a correspondence two speakers respond in such a manner\nthat the longer it continues the more each correspondent becomes\npolarized in his own character (1968, 21).\n\n\nIn speech then we really make each other and hence we are literally,\nfor Rosenstock-Huessy, the word made flesh. The corollary of this is\nthat \u2018we ourselves become structured by grammar\u2019. He puts\nit more forcefully when he writes \u2018most men are shards of broken\ngrammar\u2019 (1968, 37 and 43), and he went so far as to hold that\ngrammar is the key to us as social organisms. In keeping with this, he\nproposed a re-working of the social sciences on the basis of a\ngrammatical revolution. Indeed, he believes that as things are now,\nthe social sciences rest on a grammar that is akin to Ptolemaic\nastronomy. (See \u2018Die kopernikanische Wendung der\nGrammatik\u2019 in Die Sprache des\nMenschengeschlechts.)\n\nVery briefly, he argues that the intellectual life of nations, and the\nprofessions which give us social orientation, are responses to the\nuniverse seeking its own enhancement through the distribution of tasks\nand activities which have a grammatical underpinning. Thus, deploying\nthe quadrilateral matrix necessary for correctly observing any social\nreality, he argues that our experiences will be accumulated and\ndevolved through these spatial/temporal grammatical modules so\nthat:\n\nthe subjunctive of grammar, in the life of a great nation, is\nrepresented by music, by poetry, by all the arts. The equations of our\ncalculating logic are spread out in all the sciences and techniques.\nThe trajective, linking us with the living past, lives in us through\nall the traditions. The prejective is represented by prophecy, ethics,\nprogrammatic movements (1970a, 187).\n\n\nAccordingly, the professions (lawyers, preachers, artists and\nscientists) are grammatical necessities, each profession accentuating\nan aspect of reality whose grammatical mode is the trajective,\nprejective, subjective and objective respectively. For\nRosenstock-Huessy, a society\u2019s survival and development depends very\nmuch on its ability to cope adequately with its inner and outer\nspatial and trajective and prejective temporal potencies. We need to\nwork with all these potencies and the great danger of philosophy is\nthat it elevates its own importance\u2014and the procedures and\ngrammatical elements which constitute it\u2014at the expense of other\npotencies which are only disclosed and developed through other\ngrammatical elements and procedures. In this respect,\nRosenstock-Huessy sees that when philosophy tries to dominate society\nit does so at the expense of other powers of society and hence\nultimately is pernicious. Its main deficiency lies in its\nunder-appreciation of the fecundity and importance of the polyform\nnature of speech.\n\nRosenstock-Huessy complains that linguistics has followed philosophy\nin elevating the mind above speech, as if the mind itself is the real\nthinker and speech simply a rather poor means to get from a\nto b. (\u2018Fritz Mauthner wrote 6000 pages and proved in\none and a half million words that all words lie\u2019 (1962, Vol. 1,\n554)). Such approaches to speech all follow what he calls \u2018the\nabstract madness of the school grammar\u2019, which makes the mistake\nof explaining \u2018the last grammatical creation, the declarative\nsentence \u201cthese are\u201d, as the beginning of speech.\u2019\nIn fact, he says, a declarative sentence is:\n\nonly a conclusion, behind which it has to be started again from the\nbeginning. From the declarative sentence nothing ensues for the\nfuture. That\u2019s why no knowledge of nature helps us to answer the\nquestion how we should live. The bible with its \u2018let there be\nlight\u2019 and \u2018there was light\u2019 has the experiential\ndemonstrable grammar. Imperative (prejective), conjunctive or optative\n(subjective), preterite or perfect (trajective), neutral indicative\n(objective) are grammatical necessities arising out of times and\nspaces. A higher scientific grammar can exist because from now we can\nsee the modes, the tenses, persons in a completely different way to\nthe Alexandrians (1968, 32).\n\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the Alexandrian grammar table, which was\noriginally developed in the 4th century BC as part of\nlarger pedagogical architectonic of the sciences and which is still\nthe standard manner of grammar instruction, has been one of the great\nhidden obstacles to understanding real or speech thinking. His claim\nis that the Alexandrian architectonic carries with it a specific\norientation to ourselves and reality whose core elements mistakenly\nbecome solidified and privileged and passed on as if reality itself\nwere essentially\u2014always and everywhere\u2014composed of its\nelements. In particular it privileges the disinterested, impersonal,\nreflective mode, which breaks up the world into subject and predicate,\nsubject and object. This orientation also brings everything under the\nrule of the indicative mood of the declarative sentence.\n\nIt is this emphasis upon the declarative sentence, which provides the\nanswer to \u2018what is?\u2019, that lies behind the repeated\naccusation he makes against philosophy\u2014that it has\ninstrumentalized speech. As Rosenstock-Huessy says in \u2018The Race\nof Thinkers or the Knacker\u2019s Yard of Faith\u2019 (1962, Vol. 2, 612):\n\u2018The scandalous [and terrific and unheard] claims of the\nthinkers consist in this: that first they think, and only after that\ndo they mis-advisedly or treacherously disclose what they think to us\nwith the help of speech as their\n tool.\u2019[10]\n\n\nOf course, philosophy from its inception appealed to the possibility\nof judging the world. Thus the importance to it of the subjunctive or\noptative mood. As he wrote in his early work  An Applied Science\n(or Know How) of the Soul:\n\nThings controlled by the indicative are calmly dismissed into the\nworld. The indicative describes and tells about things which are\nresting, which have been, which are finished or at hand\u2026 Being\nand existence are indeed the epitome of the indicative in all its\nvarieties, because it \u2018allows\u2019 something to be said about\nthe world\u2026The philosophy which deifies man is called Idealism\nsince it thrives on freedom of the will. Freedom, however, is the most\npithy expression for the subjunctive which expresses everything coming\nto be. Freedom is the most pithy expression for not wanting to obey\nyet the laws of existence, for wishing to think of oneself not as part\nof the world but as divinely inspired, as an Idealist (1924, 14).\n\n\nAlso:\n\nPhilosophy in which the intellect lets everything revolve around the\n\u2018I\u2019 starts with the assumption of eternal freedom. Natural\nscience, emphatically revolving around the \u2018it\u2019, starts\nwith the principles of law (1924, 42).\n\n\nKant\u2019s distinction between theoretical and practical reason\nexemplifies how this move from indicative to subjunctive is\nattempted\u2014as the categorical imperative first requires\nacknowledging that the will (the base of the subjunctive) is only free\nwhen it is not in violation of the laws potentially knowable by\ntheoretical reason (the indicative). Thus, when Kant says that he\nwishes to create a rational faith by defining the limits of\nexperience, just as when he says that \u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019, he is really showing, from Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s\nperspective, that the entire metaphysical edifice is derived from a\nlexical ordering of grammar.\n\nThe architecture of the Alexandrian grammar was itself a result of the\ncentral role that it had ascribed to philosophy in the sciences so its\nconcurrence with philosophy in grammatical priorities should come as\nno surprise. To a large extent it does this because it has already\nmade some fundamental linguistic commitments which Rosenstock-Huessy\nthinks have plagued philosophy from its very inception and whose span\ncan be witnessed from Parmenides to Heidegger, and which he also sees\nas repeatedly dragging philosophy and its followers into phantasmic\npursuits. In the first instance, and what he holds responsible for\nphilosophy\u2019s break from what he calls its \u2018aboriginal\nhumanity\u2019, is its grammatical preference for pronominals rather\nthan names (1970b, 77\u201390).\n\nRosenstock-Huessy argues that it is not only from the moment of birth\nthat one is inducted via names\u2014the names of one\u2019s parents, their\nfamily, one\u2019s birthplace, one\u2019s own name\u2014 but our life is a\ncontinuous accrual of names as each person is shaped by his or her\nexperiences, thus developing new qualities or characteristics. Through\nthe course of a life each of us is enmeshed in an expanding cluster of\ntitles that reflect one\u2019s responses to the callings and imperatives of\none\u2019s parents, friends, teachers, spouse and children, colleagues,\ngovernment, society and, far from being least, one\u2019s enemies. Naming\nis orientating. As he says in Ja und Nein:\n\nIn every healthy society, one is inducted and introduced\n(vorgestellt), because life continues as a chain of people\nand things who have been introduced/ represented\n(Vorgestellten). That\u2019s how one enters history, in so far as\none asks after my name and then one acclaims the other\u2026The\nhuman world does not consist of \u2018will and representation\u2019\nbut as love and introduction/representation (1968, p.\n 22).[11]\n\n\nNames, then, refer to dynamic processes that move over time. On the\nother hand pronominals transport us beyond those processes to\nsomething more stable; they take us out of the specific relationship\nand have us think about relationships in a more general manner. As\nwith Schelling\u2019s distinction between positive and negative philosophy\nand the limits of the later, Rosenstock-Huessy is highly suspicious of\nabstractions and he believes that philosophers have tended to put too\nmuch faith in them, believing that they provide the magic key for\nbringing order into the disorder of the world. The accusation by\nSocrates that his interlocutors do not have a specific virtue unless\nthey can provide a logically tight definition for \u2018what (the\nspecific) virtue is\u2019, and the Parmenidian formulation that\n\u2018being is\u2019 are, for Rosenstock-Huessy, but variants of\nthis mistaken grammatical faith.\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the problem with the kind of case Plato makes\nin favor of essences and against names in the Cratylus (where\nhe provides a satire on the sophists\u2019 use of etymology) is that the\nessence is purchased at the expense of the many processes which names\nrightly recognize as many. Of course Plato insists that the one and\nthe many must be brought into the union of knowledge\u2019s correct\ndefinition. But Rosenstock-Huessy argues that names are primarily an\nhistorical founding, and hence not a logical matter. Rosenstock-Huessy\nemphasized this point in his Lectures on Greek Philosophy\nwhen he contrasted Book 2 of the Iliad, where Homer recalls\nthe ships and the names of the places and commanders of the different\narmies of the Greeks, with Plato. \u2018Homer\u2019s heart,\u2019 he\nsays, \u2018is in following the first impressions also in the\nphysical, in the real life\u2026He\u2019s not systematic. He\u2019s\nanti-philosophical\u2026Because a philosopher must have all his\nmaterial gathered before he can subdivide it\u2026Therefore it\u2019s\nalways a second impression, it\u2019s an afterthought.\u2019 Whereas the\nphilosopher is suspicious of the same name that may be concealing\ndifferent essences, Homer is not interested if two people have the\nsame name in trying to establish a common essence, but in this naming\nof the ships \u2018poetry has to keep the individual names of every\none city here\u2019 (1956b, Oct 18).\n\nUnlike a pronoun, a specific name locates, sums up, emphasizes an\nevent that has been or will become; it is done to orientate (even if,\nas in a lie, to veil). As Rosenstock-Huessy says:\n\n\nThe political power of names makes people circulate. Names signify our\ndivision of labor. They make room for a man and a thing. The\n\u2018throne\u2019, the \u2018hustings\u2019, our\n\u2018tongue\u2019 as Greeks, the \u2018eye of justice\u2019, the\n\u2018thunder of Zeus\u2019, those were all names whose invocation\nmade people move out or in\u2026\n\nNames make no sense unless they stand in mutual relation. Mother is\nnot mother unless she may call, under the law, somebody the father.\nBrother is brother to a sister. And unless he calls her sister and she\ncalls him brother, the name is worthless. The general and the\nsergeant, the master and the apprentice, the army and the navy make\nroom for each other, in the wonderful whole of names. All names belong\nto this holon, to society. No name is good without the\nothers. The Pan of the universe drives people panicky, that is they\nlose speech. The holon of the city gives everybody a name in\nsuch a manner that everybody else now can be named by him, too (1970b,\n83\u201384).\n\n\nOn the other hand, a pronoun is a way of not being precise about such\nthings as location, emergence, faith, hope, or love:\n\n\nPronouns are a compromise between the real name of a person or a thing\nand the pointing finger while such person or thing is within the reach\nof our sense perception. To call a spade a spade is one thing; to\npoint to the spade while it lies before us, which simply requires the\ngesture and a \u2018there!\u2019, is a totally different act. One is\nthe act of naming, the other is an attempt to reduce naming to its\ninformal minimum (1970b, 82).\n\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy the problem of names is also a key component in\nthe dispute between Heraclitus\u2019 flux and Parmenides\u2019 sphere of being.\nLike Nietzsche, he saw that the two philosophies represent the choice\nbetween one path generally not taken by philosophers (Heraclitus\u2019)\nwhich would enable us to enter more deeply into the tensions and\nstruggles of life, and another (the road more traveled of Parmenides)\nwhich stabilizes and logicizes and hence simplifies the abstract\nworld, thus making it of very limited real worth for orientating us in\nlife. In what he calls a \u2018conjuration\u2019, a letter he\ncomposes from Heraclitus to Parmenides, he has Heraclitus say to\nParmenides: \u2018\u201cBeing\u201d is the scalp of the divine acts\nand the political names. This scalp hangs dangling on your belt. To\nhell with your \u201cpronoun\u201d, to hell with your\n\u201cpro-verb\u201d \u201cbeing\u201d. Or we shall all find\nourselves in hell\u2019 (1970b, 90).\n\nIn Ja und Nein he makes the point that what is done with\nnouns is also done with verbs, most notably in the case of philosophy\nwith the verb sein (to be)/ noun Das Sein which is\nthen rendered as being, which he sees as simply the dead husk or the\nsmoke of what once had life.\n\nChildren say \u2018you\u2019, \u2018I\u2019, \u2018there\u2019,\n\u2018here\u2019\u2026 Philosophers though love one pronoun above\nall others: the little word \u2018being\u2019. Being involves the\nloss of seeing and hearing (Sein. Da vergehen ihm H\u00f6ren und\nSehen). He wants to ground being. \u2018Being\u2019\n(\u2018Das Sein\u2019) along with the forms am, are, is, is\na pro-verb in exactly the same way as \u2018this\u2019 is a pronoun.\nThe famous copula \u2018is\u2019 stands for all verbs as a\nstenophon, an abbreviation. Only one who experiences all verbs and\ncites them as \u2018being\u2019 can talk of being. This is because\npronouns are senseless without the words for which they stand. Most\nphilosophies of being speak of \u2018being\u2019, without having\ndrunk from and been sated by the fullness of all verbs; that\u2019s why\nthey are noise and smoke, and that\u2019s why the existentialists explained\nthe war to them. There is only the essence of God after you have\nexperienced that God rages, creates, blesses and shakes up (1968,\n38\u201339).\n\n\nThe great choice for post-Nietzschean thinking, for Rosenstock-Huessy,\nis not so much, as Heidegger believed, a choice between continuing to\nremain entrapped in our compliance with beings rather than Being, but\nbetween continuing to take our orientation from pronominals rather\nthan giving attention to names. In this respect Heidegger is\nGreek\u2014i.e. still philosophical\u2014whereas Rosenstock-Huessy\nis (to use a much loved word of Heidegger) genuinely\n\u2018primordial\u2019 or pre-philosophical because he thinks the\npre-philosophical was wiser in its fidelity to language. Moreover,\nfrom Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s perspective, what Heidegger has in common\nwith the essentialist thinking he is so critical of, is that he still\nfools himself into thinking that he is not part of the great events of\nhistorical experiences which are encapsulated in names. Heidegger\nthinks that with thought he can move beyond them. The thought itself,\nfor Heidegger, when it is not merely pronominal pro-verbial thought,\nis so saturated in history it cannot be overleaped except by a social\nrupture and a new social foundational act and\n name.[12]\n From Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s perspective, Heidegger\u2019s deployment of\nBeing, as a gesture of defiance against the technicity into which the\nworld has fallen, is precisely the same kind of optatively-governed\ngesture which characterizes the philosopher\u2019s freedom (an aesthetic/\nmoral one). Heidegger\u2019s refers to himself in his Der Spiegel\ninterview of 1966 as awaiting a new god, a god who must remain\nnameless, on an earth from which the gods have fled. From\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s perspective, this is indicative of just how barren\nis his landscape of possibilities. For all Heidegger\u2019s talk of being\nbeyond metaphysics, from Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s perspective, Heidegger is\nso afraid of repeating the gestures and moves of metaphysics that he\nis imprisoned by them. He is still primarily a philosopher, and far\nless a Mensch, as the speech thinkers like Rosenstock-Huessy\nsought to be, exercising \u2018common sense\u2019 and\nworking with the common stock of names.\n\nBy appealing to the primacy of names, Rosenstock-Huessy is not saying\nthat one must always accept one\u2019s tradition; traditions have to\nconstantly be reinvented or reconfigured. However he does dispute that\nthe basis of that transformation is primarily a philosophical act, as\nif the disinterested philosopher could digest and judge everything\nwith his or her own mind. Names are constantly being renegotiated and\n\u2018to think means to introduce better names\u2019 (1970a, 174).\nBut for the most part this process occurs through the trial and\ncatastrophes of events and a social consensus about the meaning of the\nevent. Tracing the naming of what is now known as the Holocaust is one\nexample of how naming is often a matter of trial and error before\nthere is a consensus about which name is appropriate for the\nexperience that has traumatized a group and which that social group\nwishes to embed in its collective/institutional memory and pass on to\nfuture generations (1970a, 174).\n\nThe downgrading of the importance of the name in philosophy, for\nRosenstock-Huessy, has as its counterpart the downgrading of the\nvocative case and hence the dialogical component of truth. For\nRosenstock-Huessy, the vocative is the condition of dialogue and hence\nthe real condition of a new truth. Unlike philosophers, who generally\nbegin with the nominative case, he argues that a case such as the\nnominative is dependent upon, and hence subordinate to, the vocative.\n\u2018Vocatives create the preconditions for reciprocal\ncommunication; whereas nominatives and other cases take their place\ninside of communication. The vocative provokes the\nconversation\u2019, he says in Ja und Nein (1968, 25).\nAnd:\n\nThe vocative means: turn around and face me; we want to talk with each\nother for a while. Such a summons, invitation, challenge, introduction\nsets men in motion. The other cases enable all the named to have their\nplace. The vocative, however, turns them around!\u2026The nominative\nonly points to different things, how they stand or lay\u2026but the\nvocative belongs in the conjugation. The caller and the called belong\nin the conjugation (1968, 26).\n\n\nThis may be contrasted with the Socratic and more modern Cartesian\ntraditions. In these traditions the concrete self dissolves either\ninto the object to be studied or into the cognitive or methodological\nrules of the transcendental subject. In both instances the truth is\nthe objective fact or state of affairs. But for Rosenstock-Huessy what\nis being left out of this picture is the participative role we all\nhave in world-making and that role brings with it a knowledge and\nsense of our own purposefulness. What is so important is that creative\naddress requires being open to the unpredictable. The social world is\ngenerated by decisive acts of inspiration and history and is , inter\nalia, a tapestry of inspired and unpredictable acts. The more\npredictable a group\u2019s actions become, the more spiritless they\nbecome.\n\nThis lack of emphasis upon the vocative is closely related to\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s attempt to redress what he sees as the over\naccentuation of the modern faith in analysis, which is part of its\nphilosophical legacy and also part of philosophy\u2019s aspiration to rule.\nAccording to Rosenstock-Huessy, the real sequence of orientation is:\nobey, communicate, explain, systematize.\n\nIn the first instance one hears a name called out above one, then one\ncommunicates with another, who participates in the same named group as\nhim. In the third we report, everything that has been done and has\nhappened under this name; we report, we explain and we establish what\nis happening. Finally we oversee everything and compare and draw the\nsum of everything into a logical system. We analyze (1968, 32).\n\n\nAnalysis, then, is the conclusion of a process. At no stage does\nRosenstock-Huessy claim that analysis or philosophy are completely\nunhelpful\u2014but their benefits require that they are part of a\nlinguistic whole and that whole is what forms the social organism\nwithin which philosophy may play its role. According to\nRosenstock-Huessy, philosophy tends to mistake the part for the whole\nand wrongly assume that the small measure of reason we have is being\npowerful enough to be the measure of all. The process briefly\ndescribed above is what forms the collective \u2018we\u2019. This\nformation of the \u2018we\u2019 is at the basis of all common\nendeavors. It applies as much to the case of philosophers or natural\nscientists\u2014for the group of \u2018analysts\u2019\u2014as for\nany group. Science tends to concentrate on the array of its results\nand the application of methods and experiments etc. which achieve\nthem. However, no less real are the human and institutional processes\nthat are involved. The audacity of Galileo; the sweat and sacrifice of\na science student to learn difficult material; the solidarity in\npursuit of the truth about nature\u2019s workings: these are all\nindispensable to science and enable scientists to share a common\npursuit and what Rosenstock-Huessy calls a particular\n\u2018present\u2019 in a \u2018time body\u2019. As he writes in\nhis The Hegemony of Spaces:\n\nOnly because all physicists describe one Physics, because\n\u2018Physics\u2019 has existed from 1600 to 1950, thanks only to\nthis omnipresence of Physics for 350 years, is the chain of\nexperiments and mistakes meaningful. Physics can make gigantic\nmistakes and false teachings, a thousand times more than a single\nmortal, because it has a great present, on which the most distant\nfuture and the oldest past work (2009,1,318).\n\n\nIn contrast to real speech, which is developed over time,\nRosenstock-Huessy sees that \u2018philosophy talks to man as though\nthe experiment of living had not yet taken place before the\nexperiment, so to speak. \u201cReason\u201d always argues before the\nevent, before our soul, has been incarnated, before God has come into\nthe world\u2019 (1941, 6). Philosophy is able to occupy a zone in\nwhich our problems and its solution are\n\u2018eternalized\u2019\u2014it stops time and that shows in its\nsolutions. In sum, it is a-historical while our challenges and crises\nare in history and in time.\n\nAlthough other philosophers (in particular Heidegger, Schelling, and\nBergson) make time important, Rosenstock-Huessy was not at all\nconvinced that they had done it sufficiently. In the case of Schelling\nand Bergson it was because they remained imprisoned by the mechanistic\nconception of sequential time in which past, present and future move\nin the one direction. Thus, in the opening chapter of volume 2 of the\nIn the Cross of Reality, he takes issue with Schelling\u2019s\ndeclaration in the Ages of the World that \u2018the past is\nknown, the present cognized, the future intimated\u2019 (2009, 2 16).\nWhile Schelling is a major critic of mechanistic philosophy, and his\ncall for a narrative philosophy is explicitly acknowledged by Franz\nRosenzweig as being one of the most important precursors of the new\nthinking, the notion of time expressed here is decisively sequential\nand not at all at odds with the mechanistic conception of time which\nhas evolved out of\n philosophy.[13]\n Such a representation of space and time as one finds in the new\nsciences of the philosophies of Descartes, Newton, and Kant (for all\ntheir differences), certainly enables the sharpening of our\nunderstanding and observation of causal or material process. However,\nsocially and personally we experience time as the push of the past and\nthe future. Our present is not simply a passing point on a one-way\nflow, but the intersection of past and future in our\npresent\u2014future coming back to us as much as past coming toward\nus. Rosenstock-Huessy believed that this is how we experience the\nhistorical catastrophes which come from the conflict between\nsuffocating spaces and the freedom to found a new time. Heidegger\u2019s\nemphasis upon thrownness and projection make him much closer to\nRosenstock-Huessy, but his substitution of historicity for real\nhistory, and hence real times, evident in the above discussion on\nnames, remains a dividing line between them.\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, our temporal and purposeful nature is evident\nin our grammar and our institutions. Institutions are the embodiment\nand reproduction of a particular coalition of temporal forces.\n\u2018Without a multiplicity of times\u2019, he says \u2018I remain\nspeechless\u2019 (1968, 12). Moreover, time and passion and history\nform an important connection which all come together in speech. Above\nall, time is experienced as history and this is as much so\nindividually as collectively. History is not simply a sequential flow\nof forces which have their naturalistic counterparts. Rather,\ndifferent events stamp themselves in the hearts and minds of a people\nand continue to impact upon a group long after their occurrence,\nthereby, at different times and to different degrees, activating\npassions of subsequent generations. Much of Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s work\nis devoted to the great \u2018events\u2019, the great catastrophes,\nand the time bodies ensuing from them which have given us our\nparticular historical character. More generally, this activation of\nthe passions by past events and the replacement of one pantheon of\nnames by another\u2014as a hateful future is replaced by the promise\nof one more venerable\u2014is a fundamental aspect of world-making\nand it is ultimately why, for him, names are so important. Names are\ntestimonies to events and, just as our speech is a means to activate\nus, they are the fundamental triggers of the passions and hence of our\nworld making. Names are the testimonies of what we love, of what calls\nus to act or of what has become so hateful that new directions must be\nopened up and new names found. History is a great pantheon of names,\nnames which are the registers of passions and total commitments past.\nWhen those names no longer em-passion then that component of a group\u2019s\nhistory is dead.\n\nHowever, history is not simply a plurality of names. Rosenstock-Huessy\nargued that it also tends toward a common story, as speakers and\nlisteners are forced by successive catastrophes to become increasingly\nintegrated into common spaces and times and to see the connection\nbetween the times and hence between each other. Such a connection can\nonly be a real connection if it takes account of the bloody conflicts\nand the different responses and causes behind war and revolution as\nmuch as the moments and successes of common cause. That is, it must be\nmulti-vocular. However, being multi-vocular is not the same as being\nan archipelago of hermetically sealed cries; history provides the\ndifference between Babel (the interminable inability to communicate\none\u2019s suffering and one\u2019s love, faith, and hopes) and a possible\ncommon future. \u2018All history is the tale of acts in which some\nspeaker and some listener have become one\u2019 (1970a, 109). It is\nthe formation of \u2018we \u2019. Thus, he says in Ja und\nNein, \u2018we discover the founding act of life as the shaking\nup or shock (Ersch\u00fctterung) of a man so that he is\nactivated, finally activated and called upon to join in the formation\nof history in his own name\u2019 (1968, 26).\n\nWhat ultimately concerns Rosenstock-Huessy is incarnation and he\nbelieves that philosophy not only has not been sufficiently attentive\nto the process of incarnation and its historical importance, but that\nreligions, especially Christianity, have been far more successful in\ntheir fruits than philosophy\u2014a claim he attempts to back up in\nhis historical writings on the Church and Christendom. Modernity was\nin many ways an attempt by philosophy to replace Christianity in\nEurope as an incarnatory force with its sciences and morals and art,\nin sum its humanism. But he believed\u2014and this is the seminal\nevent overhanging all his thought\u2014that the devastation of the\nWorld Wars had disproved its claim, and that humanism had discovered,\nbut not sufficiently digested, the truth of incarnation: that it is\nbased upon service to somebody. The nations became the gods of the\nmoderns. This had not been foreseen by those philosophers who had\ndivinized nature and/or the self. Nor had the pioneers of humanism\never envisaged a world in which monsters, such as Stalin, Hitler and\nthe like, would be as gods ruling over \u2018selves\u2019 and the\nsciences.\n",
