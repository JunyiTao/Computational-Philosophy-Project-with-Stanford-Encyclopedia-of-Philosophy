    "main_text": "\n\nPhilo (159/8\u201384/3 BCE) was the last known head of Plato\u2019s\nAcademy during its skeptical phase. Under his leadership, the\nAcademics abandoned the radical skepticism of Arcesilaus and Carneades\n(who professed to live without rationally warranted beliefs) in favor\nof a form of mitigated skepticism allowing for provisional beliefs\nthat did not claim certainty. But Philo himself seems to have gone a\nstep further in his controversial \u201cRoman Books\u201d, where he\nrejected the Stoic definition of knowledge on which the\nAcademics\u2019 mitigated skepticism relied. The evidence suggests\nthat he proposed instead a weaker, fallibilist theory that allowed for\nordinary knowledge but did not support the theoretical dogmatism of\nthe Academics\u2019 philosophical rivals. By challenging the accepted\nepistemological framework of the Hellenistic period, Philo thus\ninadvertently helped to set the stage for the subsequent revival of\nPlatonism as a dogmatic tradition based on the interpretation of\nPlatonic doctrines. He is most widely known, however, as the teacher\nof Cicero, through whose work Academic skepticism became known in the\nLatin-reading world.\n",
