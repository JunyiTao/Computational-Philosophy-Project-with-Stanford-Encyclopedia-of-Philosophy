    "main_text": "\n\nLogicism is a philosophical, foundational, and\nfoundationalist doctrine that can be advanced with respect to\nany branch of mathematics. Traditionally, logicism has concerned\nitself especially with arithmetic and real analysis. It comes in a\nstronger and a weaker version.\n\nThe strong version of logicism maintains that all\nmathematical truths in the chosen branch(es) form a species\nof logical truth. The weak version of logicism, by contrast, maintains\nonly that all the theorems do. (By \u2018theorems\u2019 we\nmean results that are provable within the branch of\nmathematics in question.) The foundationalism is with respect to those\nparts of mathematics that the logicist reconstructs. Success in this\nregard is compatible, however, with a non-foundationalist (e.g.,\ncoherentist) view of the parts of mathematics that cannot be so\nreconstructed.\n\nBoth versions of logicism\u2014strong and weak\u2014maintain\nthat\n\nAll the objects forming the subject matter of those\nbranches of mathematics are logical objects; and\nLogic\u2014in some suitably general and powerful sense that the\nlogicist will have to define\u2014is capable of furnishing\ndefinitions of the primitive concepts of these branches of\nmathematics, allowing one to derive the mathematician\u2019s\n\u2018first principles\u2019 therein as results within Logic itself.\n(The branch of mathematics in question is thereby said to have been\nreduced to Logic.)\n\n\nFor the foundationalist who accepts Kant\u2019s distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic truth, the truths of logic are paradigm cases\nof analytic truths. They are true solely by virtue of the meanings\nof the linguistic expressions involved in expressing them; or, as\nKant might have preferred it, by virtue of internal relations among\nthe concepts involved. A successful logicist reduction of any branch\nof mathematics will therefore show that its truths (strong version) or\nits theorems (weak version) are analytic.\n\nAnother consequence of successful logicist reduction of a given branch\nof mathematics is that mathematical certainty (within that branch) is\nof a piece with certainty about logical truth. The same holds for\nnecessity; and for the a priori character of the knowledge\nconcerned.\n\nLogicist doctrines were espoused in two main forms\u2014Fregean and\nRussellian\u2014until around 1930, at which point logicism went into\ndecline, largely because of the discovery of G\u00f6delian\nincompleteness, and the ascendancy of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,\nwhich displaced the Russellian theory of types as the most promising\nfoundational theory for mathematics. The doctrine of\nneo-logicism subsequently revived some of the core ideas of\nlogicism, with its first hints appearing in the mid-1960s, and its\nmore substantive contributions beginning in the 1980s.\n\nThe main technical and philosophical innovation of the\nneo-logicists is their use of abstraction principles\nin order to secure the existence of such things as numbers,\nunderstood, with Frege, as logical objects. One favored kind\nof abstraction principle typically effects the reification of\nequivalence classes of an equivalence\n relation.[1]\n One of Frege\u2019s favorite examples involved the equivalence\nrelation of parallelism among lines. The relevant abstraction would be\nthat of the direction of a line. Thus, two lines \\(l_1\\) and\n\\(l_2\\) have the same direction just in case they are\nparallel: \n\\[d(l_1) = d(l_2) \\Leftrightarrow l_1 || l_2.\\]\n\n\nThe function denoted by the abstraction operator \\(d(\\,)\\) is here\napplied to lines, and produces directions (new abstract\nobjects) as its values. Note that the abstraction operator can take\nvariables as arguments.\n\nThe neo-logicists characterize abstraction operators that produce\nnumbers as their values. Details of notation and method will\nbe provided in due course.\n\nThere has not been any historical trend discernible as an\nevolution of the doctrine of logicism, with incremental\nadjustments to deal with occasional problems as they arose, while\nmaintaining a reasonably stable trajectory towards an ideal\nformulation. Rather, the doctrine has been characterized by abrupt\nshifts as far as methods and materials are concerned, even if the goal\nhas remained relatively constant through such\n changes.[2]\n We shall allow the pattern of change to become evident as the\ndifferent phases of logicism are recounted below.\n",
