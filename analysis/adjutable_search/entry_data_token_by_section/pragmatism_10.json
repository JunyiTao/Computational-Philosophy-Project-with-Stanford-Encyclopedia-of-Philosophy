    "main_text": "Further pragmatists || The Early Years\n5.1 The Early Years\n\nIt would be wrong to conclude that pragmatism was restricted to the\nUnited States or that the only important pragmatist thinkers were\nPeirce, James and Dewey. As is documented by Thayer, there were\npragmatists in Oxford, in France and, especially, in Italy in the\nearly years of the twentieth century (Thayer 1968, part III, Baldwin\n2003: 88\u20139). Moreover we can mention several other important\nAmerican pragmatists, for example Josiah Royce. Commonly thought to be\nan idealist opponent of James and a critic of pragmatism, Royce\nincreasingly came to be influenced by Peirce\u2019s work on signs and\non the community of inquirers and was acknowledged as a fellow\npragmatist by Peirce himself. C.I. Lewis, the teacher of Quine and of\nseveral generations of Harvard philosophers developed a philosophy\nthat was a sort of pragmatist Kantianism. Murray Murphey has\nidentified him as \u2018the last great pragmatist\u2019 (Murphey\n2005). In books such as Mind and the World Order (1929), he\ndefended a pragmatist conception of the a priori, holding that\nour choices of laws of logic and systems of classification were to be\ndetermined by pragmatic criteria (Lewis 1923, 1929; Murphey 2005:\nchapters four and five). Of comparable importance was George Herbert\nMead, whose contribution to the social sciences has been noted. The\nwork of Frank Ramsey at Cambridge (Ramsey 1926) in the 1920s developed\nPeirce\u2019s views on statistical reasoning and on inquiry in ways\nthat provided fertile research programmes through much of the century,\nfor example in the work of Isaac Levi at Columbia (Levi 2012). As a\nnumber of scholars have documented (Boncompagni 2016; Goodman 2002),\nWittgenstein\u2019s later thought acquired a pragmatist flavour\nthrough his reading of James\u2019s Varieties of Religious\nExperience (1902).\n",
