    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Action || Action, Unpredictability, and Irreversibility\n4.5 Action, Unpredictability, and Irreversibility\n\n\nThe discussion of Arendt\u2019s theory of action so far has stressed\na number of features, chief among which is action\u2019s capacity to\ndisclose the identity of the agent, to enable freedom to appear and be\nactualized as a worldly reality, to create and sustain a public space\nof appearance, and to make possible the generation of power. We have\nalso emphasized the importance of narrative and remembrance, of the\nretrospective articulation of the meaning of action by means of\nstorytelling and its preservation through a community of memory. In\nconclusion, we examine two other features of action,\nnamely, unpredictability and\nirreversibility, and their respective remedies, the\npower of promise and the power to forgive.\n\n\nAction is unpredictable because it is a manifestation of freedom, of\nthe capacity to innovate and to alter situations by engaging in them;\nbut also, and primarily, because it takes place within the web of\nhuman relationships, within a context defined by plurality, so that no\nactor can control its final outcome. Each actor sets off processes and\nenters into the inextricable web of actions and events to which all\nother actors also contribute, with the result that the outcome can\nnever be predicted from the intentions of any particular actor. The\nopen and unpredictable nature of action is a consequence of human\nfreedom and plurality: by acting we are free to start processes and\nbring about new events, but no actor has the power to control the\nconsequences of his or her deeds.\n\n\nAnother and related reason for the unpredictability of action is that\nits consequences are boundless: every act sets in motion an unlimited\nnumber of actions and reactions which have literally no end.  As\nArendt puts it: \u201cThe reason why we are never able to foretell\nwith certainty the outcome and end of any action is simply that action\nhas no end\u201d (HC, 233). This is because action \u201cthough it\nmay proceed from nowhere, so to speak, acts into a medium where every\naction becomes a chain reaction and where every process is the cause\nof new processes \u2026 the smallest act in the most limited\ncircumstances bears the seed of the same boundlessness, because one\ndeed, and sometimes one word, suffices to change every\nconstellation\u201d (HC, 190).\n\n\nClosely connected to the boundlessness and unpredictability of action\nis its irreversibility. Every action sets off processes which cannot\nbe undone or retrieved in the way, say, we are able to undo a faulty\nproduct of our hands. If one builds an artifact and is not satisfied\nwith it, it can always be destroyed and recreated again. This is\nimpossible where action is concerned, because action always takes\nplace within an already existing web of human relationships, where\nevery action becomes a reaction, every deed a source of future deeds,\nand none of these can be stopped or subsequently undone. The\nconsequences of each act are thus not only unpredictable but also\nirreversible; the processes started by action can neither be\ncontrolled nor be reversed.\n\n\nThe remedy which the tradition of Western thought has proposed for the\nunpredictability and irreversibility of action has consisted in\nabstaining from action altogether, in the withdrawal from the sphere\nof interaction with others, in the hope that one\u2019s freedom and\nintegrity could thereby be preserved. Platonism, Stoicism and\nChristianity elevated the sphere of contemplation above the sphere of\naction, precisely because in the former one could be free from the\nentanglements and frustrations of action. Arendt\u2019s proposal, by\ncontrast, is not to turn one\u2019s back on the realm of human affairs, but\nto rely on two faculties inherent in action itself, the faculty of\nforgiving and the faculty of\npromising. These two faculties are closely connected,\nthe former mitigating the irreversibility of action by absolving the\nactor from the unintended consequences of his or her deeds, the latter\nmoderating the uncertainty of its outcome by binding actors to certain\ncourses of action and thereby setting some limit to the\nunpredictability of the future. Both faculties are, in this respect,\nconnected to temporality: from the standpoint of the present\nforgiving looks backward to what has happened and absolves the actor\nfrom what was unintentionally done, while promising looks forward as\nit seeks to establish islands of security in an otherwise uncertain\nand unpredictable future.\n\n\nForgiving enables us to come to terms with the past and liberates us\nto some extent from the burden of irreversibility; promising allows us\nto face the future and to set some bounds to its unpredictability. As\nArendt puts it: \u201cWithout being forgiven, released from the\nconsequences of what we have done, our capacity to act would, as it\nwere, be confined to one single deed from which we could never\nrecover; we would remain the victims of its consequences\nforever.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cwithout being bound to the\nfulfillment of promises, we would never be able to keep our\nidentities; we would be condemned to wander helplessly and without\ndirection in the darkness of each man\u2019s lonely heart\u201d (HC,\n237). Both faculties, in this sense, depend on plurality, on\nthe presence and acting of others, for no one can forgive himself and\nno one can feel bound by a promise made only to one\u2019s self. At the\nsame time, both faculties are an expression of human freedom,\nsince without the faculty to undo what we have done in the past, and\nwithout the ability to control at least partially the processes we\nhave started, we would be the victims \u201cof an automatic necessity\nbearing all the marks of inexorable laws\u201d (HC, 246).\n",
