Life and Works: Some Comments on the Historiography\n\nPeter of Spain has been established as the medieval author of a work\nthat became widely known as Summule logicales magistri Petri\nHispani (Collection of Logic Matters of Master Peter of Spain).\nThe great number of manuscripts and printed editions is evidence of\nthe enormous success this work met with throughout European\nuniversities well into the seventeenth century. An interpolated\nversion of his Tractatus, by then known as the Summulae\nlogicales, was used by John Buridan as a basic text to comment\nupon. But finding out the true identity of the author of this\ninfluential Tractatus has proved to be a difficult task. For\na long time it was assumed that he was a Portuguese who became Pope in\n1276, under the name of John XXI. There is also another, earlier\ntradition, according to which the author of the Tractatus was\nregarded as Spanish, and a member of the Dominican order. Yet another\nattribution, dating from the fifteenth century, was to a Petrus\nFerrandi Hispanus, who died between 1254 and 1259; this attribution\nwould be consistent with the idea that Peter\u2019s works on logic\noriginated from the first half of the thirteenth century. According to\nstill another attribution, the Summule was compiled by a\nBlack Friar no earlier than in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth\ncentury.\n\nThe \u2018Dominican-thesis\u2019 can be divided into three\ntraditions:\n\nThe general view that Peter of Spain, author of the\nTractatus, is someone who belonged to Order of Black\nFriars,\nThe more specific view that the author of the Tractatus\nwas a frater Petrus Alfonsi Hispanus O.P.,\nAnother specific view that the Peter of Spain who created the\nTractatus was the same Peter of Spain as the one who wrote\nthe Legenda sancti Dominici and the Office of the\nSaint\u2019s Feast, namely Petrus Ferrandi Hispanus O.P., who died in\nthe 1250s.\n\n\nCurrent research on the identity of Peter of Spain has once again\ntaken up the idea that he must have been a member of the Dominican\nOrder instead of Pope John XXI (D\u2019Ors 1997, 2001, 2003).\nHowever, we are still in the dark about the true identity of Peter of\nSpain. The most recent information we have on this score is that a\nnumber of the Dominican candidates recently suggested as the author of\nthe Tractatus can be deleted from the list (Tugwell 1999,\n2006). The lack of further information also makes it difficult to\nestablish the dates and specifics of his carreer.\n\nIt is still not possible to establish the date of origin of the\nTractatus, the work that has enjoyed such enormous success.\nRecent scholarship suggests that it could have been written any time\nbetween the 1220s and the 1250s (Ebbessen 2013, 68\u201369). It has\nuniversally been recognised as a work by Peter of Spain. Another work\nthat has been identified as Peter of Spain\u2019s is a\nSyncategoreumata (Treatise on Syncategorematic Words), which\nwas probably written some years after the Tractatus.\nConsidering the fact that in all the thirteenth-century manuscripts\nthe Syncategoreumata directly follows the Tractatus,\nand given the number of similarities between doctrinal aspects of\nthese two works on logic, it is almost certain that they were written\nby the same author. Both works seem to have originated from Southern\nFrance or Northern Spain, the region where we also find the earliest\ncommentaries on these treatises.\n\nAn extensive list of writings ascribed to an author by the name of\nPetrus Hispanus is provided by Meirinhos (2018). Besides the two works\non logic, the Petrus Hispanus in the papa-tradition is the\nsupposed author of a famous medical work Thesaurus pauperum,\nas well as fourteen other works on medicine. Writings by (a) Peter of\nSpain in the field of natural philosophy include a Scientia libri\nde anima, and commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima, De morte et vita, De sensu et sensato,\nDe animalibus, and theological works include commentaries on\nworks by pseudo-Denys the Areopagite as well as a collection of\nsermons. As yet there is no certainty about whether the author of\nthese treatises also wrote the Tractatus and the\nSyncategoreumata, or about the dates of their origin.\n\nAnother Petrus Hispanus, referred to as Petrus Hispanus\nnon-papa, has been identified as the author of the Summa\n\u2018Absoluta cuiuslibet\u2019, a late twelfth-century\nhandbook on syntax closely linked with Priscian\u2019s\nInstitutiones grammatice, libb. XVII and XVIII, which became\nvery popular later in the Middle Ages under the name Priscianus\nminor (Kneepkens 1987). The chronology of this work seems to rule\nout that this Peter of Spain is the same author as the author of the\nTractatus.\n",
