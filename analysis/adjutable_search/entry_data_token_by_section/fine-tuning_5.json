    "main_text": "Does Fine-Tuning for Life Require a Response? || Avoiding Fine-Tuning for Life Through New Physics?\n2.3 Avoiding Fine-Tuning for Life Through New Physics?\n\nBiological fine-tuning for survival and reproduction, as marvellous as\nit often appears, is regarded as unmysterious by biologists because\nevolution as driven by natural and sexual selection can generate it\n(see\n Section 1.3).\n One may hope that, similarly, future developments in fundamental\nphysics will reveal principles or mechanisms which explain the\nlife-friendly conditions in our universe.\n\nThere are two different types of scenarios of how future developments\nin physics could realize this hope: first, physicists may hit upon a\nso-called theory of everything according to which, as\nenvisaged by Albert Einstein, \n\n\nnature is so constituted that it is possible logically to lay down\nsuch strongly determined laws that within these laws only rationally\ncompletely determined constants occur (not constants, therefore, whose\nnumerical values could be changed without destroying the theory).\n(Einstein 1949: 63) \n\n\nEinstein\u2019s idea is that, ultimately, the laws and constants of\nphysics will turn out to be dictated completely by fundamental general\nprinciples. This would make considerations about alternative laws and\nconstants obsolete, and thereby undermine any perspective according to\nwhich these are fine-tuned for life.\n\nUnfortunately, developments in the last few decades have not been kind\nto hopes of the sort expressed by Einstein. In the eyes of many\nphysicists, string theory is still the most promising\ncandidate \u201ctheory of everything\u201d in that it potentially\noffers a unified account of all known forces of nature, including\ngravity. (See Susskind 2005 for a popular introduction, Rickles 2014\nfor a philosopher\u2019s historical account and Dawid 2013 for a\nrecent, favourable, methodological appraisal.) But according to our\npresent understanding of string theory, the theory has an enormous\nnumber of lowest energy states, or vacua, which would\nmanifest themselves at the empirical level in terms of radically\ndifferent effective physical laws and different values of the\nconstants. These would be the laws and constants that we have\nempirical access to, and so string theory would not come close to\nuniquely determining the laws and constants in the manner envisaged by\nEinstein.\n\nA second type of scenario according to which future developments in\nphysics may eliminate at least some fine-tuning for life would be a\ndynamical account of the generation of life-friendly\nconditions, in analogy to the Darwinian \u201cdynamical\u201d\nevolutionary account of biological fine-tuning for survival and\nreproduction. Inflationary cosmology (Guth 1981, 2000) is a paradigm\ncandidate example of such an account in that it dynamically explains\nwhy the total cosmic energy density \\(\\Omega\\) in the early universe\nis extremely close to the so-called critical value \\(\\Omega_c\\) (see\n Section 1.1)\u2014or,\n equivalently, why the overall spatial curvature of the universe is\nclose to zero. According to inflationary cosmology, the very early\nuniverse undergoes a period of exponential or near-exponential\nexpansion (\u201cinflation\u201d) which effectively flattens out\nspace and results in near-zero post-inflation curvature, leading to a\ntotal energy density \\(\\Omega\\) extremely close to the critical\ndensity \\(\\Omega_c\\). Further claimed achievements of inflationary\ncosmology include its ability to account for the observed near-perfect\nisotropy of the universe and the absence of magnetic monopoles. The\nstrongest empirical support for inflationary cosmology, however, is\nnow widely believed to come from of its apparently correct predictions\nof the shape of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations (PLANCK\ncollaboration 2014).\n\nInflationary cosmology\u2019s attractions notwithstanding, its\nsuggested achievements are not universally recognized. (See Steinhardt\n& Turok [2008] for harsh criticism by two eminent cosmologists and\nEarman & J. Moster\u00edn [1999] and McCoy [2015] for critical\nappraisals by philosophers.) However, even if its dynamical accounts\nof the flatness, isotropy, and absence of magnetic monopoles in the\nearly universe are correct, there is little reason to accept that\nsimilar accounts will be forthcoming for many other constants,\nboundary conditions, or even laws of nature that seem fine-tuned for\nlife: whereas, notably, the critical energy density \\(\\Omega_c\\) has\nindependently specifiable dynamical properties that characterize it as\na systematically distinguished value of the energy density \\(\\Omega\\),\nthe actual values of most other constants and parameters that\ncharacterize boundary conditions are not similarly distinguished and\ndo not form any clear systematic pattern (Donoghue 2007: sect. 8).\nThis makes it difficult to imagine that future physical theories will\nindeed reveal dynamical mechanisms which inevitably lead to these\nvalues (Lewis & Barnes 2016: 181f.).\n",
