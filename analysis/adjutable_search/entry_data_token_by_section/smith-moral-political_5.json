    "main_text": "Smith\u2019s Political Philosophy\n6. Conclusion\n\nSmith has an account of the nature of moral judgment, and its\ndevelopment, that is richer and subtler than Hume\u2019s; he offers a\nprototype for modern Aristotelianism in morality; he brings out the\nimportance of the imagination to moral development as few other\nphilosophers have done; he is an early and forceful promoter of the\nnotion that history is guided largely by unintended consequences; and\nhe derives from these views an unusual variant of liberal politics.\nFew of these contributions are spelled out with the clarity and tight\nargumentation that contemporary philosophers demand of their canonical\nfigures, but Smith compensates for this weakness by the humanity and\nthoughtfulness of his views, by their detachment from metaphysical\ncommitments, and by an abundance of historical and imaginative detail.\nThe richness of his ideas, and their quiet plausibility, earn him a\nplace among the most important of modern moral and political\nphilosophers.\n",
