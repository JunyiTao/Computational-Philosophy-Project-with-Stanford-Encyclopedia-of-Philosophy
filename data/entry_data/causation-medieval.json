    "preamble": "\n\nCausality plays an important role in medieval philosophical writing:\nthe dominant genre of medieval academic writing was the commentary on\nan authoritative work, very often a work of Aristotle. Of the works of\nAristotle thus commented on, the Physics plays a central\nrole.  Other of Aristotle\u2019s scientific works \u2013 On the\nHeavens and the Earth, On Generation and Corruption,\nand, of course, the Metaphysics \u2013 are also significant\nfor the study of causation: so there is a rather daunting body of work\nto survey. \n\nOne might, though, be tempted to argue that this concentration on\ncausality is simply an effect of reading Aristotle, but this would be\ntoo hasty. Medieval thinkers were attracted to the problem of\ncausality long before most of Aristotle\u2019s texts became available\nin the thirteenth century: already in the twelfth century the created\nuniverse was seen as a rational manifestation of God (Wetherbee 1988,\np. 25), and, consequently, the rational investigation of the universe\nwas seen as a way of approaching God: \u201cIn the creation of\nthings\u201d, says William of Conches, \u201cdivine power, wisdom\nand goodness are beheld\u201d (William of Conches, Glosa super\nPlatonem, p. 60). This consideration of the relation between the\nnatural world and God continues throughout the Middle Ages: for\nexample, Duns Scotus\u2019 proof of the existence of God is an a\nposteriori modal proof, based on the notion of causality (Craig\n1980; Normore 2003; Ross and Bates 2003).\n\nThus, apart from direct literary influence, the nature of the\nphilosophical and theological themes which were popular in the Middle\nAges also led to an emphasis on causality. Writers studied the\ninterrelationship of divine grace and natural processes, the role of\nthe will in ethics, free will and determinism: all of these problems\nhave an important causal component.  Similarly, they investigated the\nnature of the causal processes involved in human and animal\nperception.  These questions were often handled by methods which might\nseem to us to be extraordinarily naturalistic \u2013 naturalistic, of\ncourse, in the sense of the modes of natural investigation which were\ncurrent at the time. It comes as no surprise to know that many\nmedieval thinkers discussed the question of whether divine grace can\nincrease: what is surprising is that many of the discussions\nuse the technical tools of Aristotle\u2019s physical and biological\nworks, tools which were originally developed to discuss problems of\ncontinuity and change in the natural world.  What is even more\nsurprising is the technical proficiency of many of these discussions:\nfourteenth-century work on this topic gave rise to very acute analyses\nof the variation of continuous quantities (see Murdoch 1975), and this\nstudy of continuous variation played an important role in the\ndevelopment of the calculus.\n\n\nWhat should become evident during this survey is the extremely tight\nand complex interconnection between medieval causal theories and\nmedieval ontology. After Aristotle\u2019s texts had been assimilated,\nalmost all medieval academic theories had an ontology which was\nbasically hylomorphic: substances were composites of matter and form,\nand change was described as the loss of one form and the acquisition\nof another.  Form was not merely shape, but an active principle: the\nform of a thing was responsible for its causal role (White 1984; Goddu\n1999, p. 148).  Furthermore, in any causal interaction, the allocation\nof active and passive roles to the individuals involved tended to be\nthought of as unproblematic. Although many aspects of Aristotle\u2019s\ncausal theories were extensively and critically debated, this basic\nhylomorphism persisted throughout; and it is this, rather than\nanything more arcane, which often poses the greatest problems in\nassimilating, or evaluating, medieval thought on these topics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Causality and Motion\n\n\nThe term \u2018motion\u2019, in Aristotelian philosophy, can stand\nfor a wide range of changes of state, and not simply changes of place\n(the latter is usually known as local motion). Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics is basically an exhaustive study of motion in this\nvery wide sense. In this section, we will first deal with motion in general,\nand then with local motion. \n1.1 Motion in General\n\nThere is a large body of medieval literature which deals with general\nchange of state: it is important because it led to a great deal of\ncareful analysis of continuous change (under the heading of \u201cintension\nand remission of forms\u201d), and this body of analysis was one of the\ncontributing currents which led to the invention of the calculus in\nthe sixteenth century. So, we can look at this literature from two\nviewpoints: either from the tradition which it grew out of \u2013\nthat of interpretations on Aristotle\u2019s Physics and the\npicture of change found there \u2013 or from the viewpoint of what it\nled to, that is, the analysis of continuous change. Either viewpoint\ncan be regarded as doing violence to the historical material, either\nby disregarding what was new in it, or by isolating the innovation\nfrom the tradition.\n\nFirst we can look at the starting point. There\nwas a great deal of argument, in the thirteenth\nand fourteenth century, about the precise interpretation of \nAristotle\u2019s theory of change: this theory talks about the bringing\nabout of change, by an agent, in a patient, and, furthermore, \nit talks about the change happening because of the transmission of a form \nfrom the agent to the patient.  The key text for this is \nAristotle, Physics III, cc2\u20133 (202a9\u201320), and it is very obscure. \nBecause of this obscurity, there is room for a good deal of disagreement\nabout the details: see (L\u00f6we 2017) for a particularly baroque example. \n\nNext we can look at study of intension and remission of forms: (Goubier and\nRoques 2017) is a good recent collection of work on this, Sylla (1982) shows\nhow this work was related to, and to some extent originated in, disputations \nabout logic, and Dumont (2009) \nshows how these debates were related to their theological context. We must not \nforget, though, that modern scholarship on this topic\ngoes back to at least Anneliese Maier (1964), whose work goes back to the\n1930s, and that she was working in the tradition of Pierre Duhem. So there is\na vast body of work on this topic, written by people with a variety\nof agendas. Despite this, it is a very interesting body of literature, \nand, if it might seem impossibly complex, it is thus because it reflects\nthe variety of medieval and early modern viewpoints on this material. \n\nMotions are, in Aristotle\u2019s physics, classified into\nnatural and violent. A paradigmatic example of\nnatural (local) motion is the motion of a freely falling body, whereas\nan example of violent (local) motion would be the motion of a thrown\nbody. The motion of a falling body is natural because\na heavy body has a natural tendency to move\ndownwards, or, as the thirteenth-century philosopher Peter of\nAuvergne puts it, \u201cbeing below is the principal end\nof a heavy body\u201d (Trifolgi 2015, p. 93).\n1.2 Local Motion\n\nNow if we throw a body, then it is, in this framework, relatively\nunproblematic to account for the motion when it is in contact with our\nhand: what is difficult is to account for its continued motion\nthereafter.  Aristotle\u2019s theory accounts for it by saying that,\nwhen it is moving, a temporary vacuum is caused behind it, and, in\norder to fill in this vacuum, air rushes around from the front, thus\nleaving a void in front of the projectile which is filled by the\ncontinued motion of the projectile. This explanation was vulnerable to\na large number of objections \u2013 for example, it is clearly easier\nto throw a moderately heavy object, such as a stone, than a light\nobject, such as a bean, whereas light objects ought to be more\nsusceptible than others to motions of the air. And Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory, when confronted with the example of two stones thrown in\nopposite directions so as to pass near to one another, cannot\nconsistently say how the air is supposed to move in the neighbourhood\nof their close encounter. These objections were made by numerous\nmedieval authors, most significantly by John Buridan (De Caelo et\nMundo III, qu. 22, pp. 227ff.) and Nicole Oresme (Du ciel et\ndu monde II, ch. 25ff., pp. 525ff.).\n\nThis critique of Aristotle\u2019s theory of projectile motion did not\ncome out of nowhere. Aristotle relied on a concept of natural motion,\nand that, in turn, relied on a concept of natural place:\nnatural motion was motion towards the natural place of a body (i.e.\nmotion downwards in the case of earth, and motion upwards in the case\nof fire). (Aristotle, Physics IV.5, 212b30\u2013213a5) Ockham is\nalready quite equivocal about the concept of natural place: and this is\nfor several reasons.\n\nOne is that \u2013 as we shall see later \u2013 he is generally quite\nsuspicious about teleology, and the concept of natural place is\nbasically a teleological one. Correspondingly, Ockham attempts \u2013 not\nvery successfully \u2013 to explain the kinematics associated with natural\nplace in terms of efficient causality. (Ockham, Expositio\nPhysicorum IV, c6: Opera Philosophica V, p. 78; Goddu\n1984, pp. 122ff.).\nAnother reason is because of several examples which tend to\nundermine the difference between rest and motion. Ockham, and many\nother medievals, have reductionist accounts of place in terms of\ncontact between bodies; the place of a body is just the surfaces of the\nbodies surrounding it (Ockham, Expositio Physicorum IV, c6:\nOpera Philosophica V, pp. 55ff.). So, if we have a ship in a\nriver, which is flowing, is the place of the ship the surface of the\nsurrounding water? Is this, then, a moving place? And what, then, would\nbe the relation between that moving place and fixed places? Ockham\neventually decides that there are only fixed places, but his arguments\nare not very strong, and one is left with the impression that the very\nideas of rest and motion have become somewhat problematic. (Ockham,\nExpositio Physicorum IV, c7: Opera Philosophica V,\npp. 79ff.; cf. Goddu 1999)\nThe final reason is motivated by a theological example: we can\nsuppose that God could create another world than this, but, in that\ncase, what would the earth of that world do? Would it move towards the\ncentre of this world (which seems to us to be the natural\nplace of earth)? Or towards the centre of the other world? (Ockham, I\nSent., d. 44: Opera Theologica IV, pp. 655\u201356; Goddu\n1984, p. 124. See also Marsilius of Inghen, Si essent plures\nmundi (1992).)\n\n\n\nCorrespondingly, both Buridan and Oresme are sceptical, not only\nabout Aristotle\u2019s theory of projectile motion, but also about the\nrelated notions of natural place, motion, and rest. They both state \u2013\nOresme far more emphatically \u2013 that it would be consistent with all we\nobserve if the earth were to rotate while the heavens remained at rest;\nOresme and Buridan have, on these grounds, been described as\n\u201cprecursors of Galileo\u201d.\n\n\nHowever, what is more interesting for us are the alternative causal\naccounts that Buridan and Oresme adopted: they both said that\nprojectiles move violently because of a form inherent in them, which\nled them to move in a non-natural direction, and which naturally\ndecayed. This form was known as \u2018impetus\u2019, and was a common\ntheme in the philosophy of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries;\nsome version of an impetus theory goes back to the early thirteenth\ncentury (Wood 1992). There was, especially in the fourteenth century, a\nconsiderable amount of quantitative work on impetus which attempted to\nestablish such things as the law according to which impetus decayed\n(Weisheipl 1982, pp. 535ff.).\n\n\nWhat is significant here is that \u2013 despite the radical changes\nin cosmology \u2013 this is is still an extremely medieval\ntheory: causation is due to forms inhering in substances, and there is\na division of the substances involved into agents and\npatients. Instead of there being a single form involved in projectile\nmotion \u2013 the form of heaviness, responsible for natural motion\ndownwards \u2013 there are two, weight and impetus, and the two\nconflict. The basic ontology is still the same, and the division into\nagents and patients, though its details may have changed, still\npersists. Furthermore, despite persistent doubts, there is still\nsomething of a distinction between motion and rest, and motion can\nonly be the result of agency. Contrast this with Galileo\u2019s or\n\u2013 still more \u2013 Newton\u2019s account: here uniform motion\nand rest are treated on an equal footing, and, consequently, there can\nbe no unequivocal distinction between motion and rest. So, although\nBuridan and Oresme are \u2013 in some sense \u2013 precursors of\nGalileo, their causal ontology is still, in important respects,\nthoroughly medieval (Maier 1964).\n2. Causality, Self-Motion, and the Will\n\n\nAn example of motion in the wider sense is an act of the will: it is\na change of state of some entity (namely the mind or soul), but would\nnot have been thought of as local motion by most medieval\nthinkers \u2013 thought and will were generally regarded as immaterial\nprocesses (see Cross 1999, p. 75).\n\n\nAristotle has a picture of willed action in which actions are caused\nby combinations of beliefs and desires: these belief-desire states are\nnot, of course, themselves actions (Normore 1998). This picture of the\nwill fits with one of Aristotle\u2019s major causal doctrines: that nothing\ncauses a change in itself.\n\n\nHowever, Aristotle\u2019s picture of the will was not undisputed in the\nMiddle Ages: as early as the twelfth century, Anselm had outlined a\ntheory in which the will was a self-mover, and in which moral conflict\nwas explained by the presence of two wills in the same person (Normore\n1998, p. 28). This position was later taken up, in conscious opposition\nto Aristotle, by thinkers in the Franciscan school \u2013 Peter Olivi, and\nthen Scotus and Ockham.\n\n\nScotus follows a modified Anselmian line, speaking of a single will,\nwith two inclinations: one towards self-fulfillment, the other towards\njustice). It is the presence of these two inclinations which\ndistinguishes willed causes from natural causes: natural causes are\ndetermined to perform their acts (unless impeded), whereas the will is\nnot thus determined (Scotus, Metaphysics IV, 9: in Scotus,\nOn the Will and Morality, pp. 136ff.; Lee 1998; Cross 1999,\npp. 84ff.). The will is thus self-determining, rather than determined\nby its end, and so Scotus affirms self-motion in psychology. In fact,\nhe goes further, and admits self-motion in physical cases as well: for\nexample, a falling object is actively moving towards its goal, and its\nmotion is caused by itself (because it is heavy); so this, too, is an\ninstance of self-motion (Effler 1962).\n\n\nOckham expands on Scotus\u2019s theory of the will to deny that actions\nare properly explained by their ends: we are influenced by\nends, but our actions are not necessitated by them and thus\nnot caused by them (Ockham, Quodlibet I, qu. 16: Opera\nTheologica IX, pp. 87ff.). A free agent is one which, under\nexactly the same circumstances, could have chosen otherwise; and so a\nfree agent can reject the Beatific Vision (and, in fact, actively turn\nto any other object whatever). (Ockham, Quodlibet IV, q. 1:\nOpera Theologica IX, pp. 292ff.).\n3. Causal Accounts of Perception\n\nPerception was, throughout the Middle Ages, a contentious topic, and\nit was also a topic in which the answers to strictly causal\nquestions could influence philosophical positions in other areas (for\nexample, on whether certain knowledge of external entities was\nattainable). The \u201ctraditional\u201d view, dating back to Roger\nBacon in the mid-thirteenth century, was that physical objects were\nknown because they caused a succession of likenesses, or\nspecies, first in the medium between the object and the perceiver,\nthen in the senses, and finally in the intellect, of the perceiver (Tachau\n1988, pp. 3ff., Normore 2010, pp. 255f.).  This position was attacked by\nthinkers such as Henry of Ghent, Peter Olivi,  and Duns Scotus. Interestingly,\nmany of these criticisms tend towards a relational account of perception, in\nwhich \u2013 although species still play a role \u2013 the role that they play\nis to be a means by which we know things, and in which the species\nthemselves are not known directly but only by reflection. (Tachau 1988, p. 66}.\n(Panaccio 2010, pp. 242f., Normore 2010, pp. 255f.)\n\nOckham then radicalised these critiques by denying that there are any\nsuch species at all: perception and other phenomena which\nwere usually explained by species \u2013 the sun heating or\nilluminating physical objects, for example \u2013 were now explained by\naction at a distance (Tachau 1988, pp. 130ff., Stump 1999). There was\na similar debate about the causal mechanisms behind memory, where,\nagain, Ockham denied a species-based account; however, in the\ncase of memory, he replaced species not with action at a distance but\nwith habits (Wolter and Adams 1993).\n\nThere was a similar late medieval debate on intentionality,\nthat is, the relation\nbetween mental states and their objects. It is no surprise, given Ockham\u2019s\narguments about species, that he took an externalist line on these,\ntoo: he poses the question by asking whether, if an angel saw the contents of\nmy mind when I was thinking about some singular object, could the angel\n(supposing that it did not know about anything external to my mind) tell which\nobject I was thinking about? Ockham answered no: and this thought experiment\nseems to show that my mental state (i.e.\\ my thinking of this particular\nobject) is not determined by the contents of my mind alone (Panaccio 2010, pp.\n242f., William of Ockham 1981, pp. 378f.). This is clearly some sort\n\tof externalist position, but describing this position exactly has proved\nto be surprisingly difficult (Panaccio 2010, Normore 2010, Brower-Toland 2007).\nCorrespondingly although many medieval thinkers were sympathetic to arguments\nof this sort, the details of the positions they adopted were by no means\nuniform. For example, followers of Scotus, such as Francis of Meyronnes, held\npositions on intentionality which were intricate, were relational in some\nsense, but were not straightforwardly externalist (Cesalli 2010). Debate on \nthese issues continues into our era, and has invited comparison with, for\nexample, Sellars (1960): Sellars\u2019 position, although interesting, does\nnot seem (as he claims) to reproduce Aquinas\u2019 position on \nintentionality (King 2010). This only shows that there are a very large\nnumber of different accounts of intentionality, and that the\nmedievals, even though they were surprisingly inventive in discovering them,\ndid not manage to discover all of them. \n\n\nOckham denies species not on the basis of empirical evidence, or on\nthe basis of epistemological arguments, but purely and simply on the\nbasis of his razor: if we deny species, then we can give an\naccount of the phenomena which uses fewer entities, because\nspecies are entities. Although this position of Ockham\u2019s did\nnot have much influence on his contemporaries or followers \u2013 it is,\nafter all, extremely implausible \u2013 it is a good example of how causal\nreasoning is affected by tacit ontological assumptions: the fact that\nspecies were seen as entities and the fact that Ockham had a\nprogramme of reducing the number of entities, led to an account of\nperception which tried to do away with species. On the other\nhand, action at a distance was, despite its implausibility, entirely\nunaffected by Ockham\u2019s critique. And, similarly, Ockham\u2019s account was\nnot noticeably simpler than the accounts it criticised, which\nshows how far Ockham\u2019s own razor was from the principles of simplicity\nand the like, which are usually considered to be its modern\nequivalents.\n\nOne should note that, although Ockham was very innovative, and altered the\nlandscape of medieval thought quite decisively, there were very few, if any,\npeople who adopted his position without modification: he produced a large\nnumber of interesting arguments, but, on the basis of these arguments, he\nadopted positions which many of his contemporaries were not convinced by (Rode\n2016, Courtenay 2008). So, although his arguments forced a reexamination of\nmany philosophical and theological doctrines, the thinkers influenced by him\ntook up a broad spectrum of positions, depending on which of his doctrines they\nassented to and which of them they rejected. Walter Chatton, for example,\ndenied Ockham\u2019s position on intuitive cognition \u2013 namely, that when\nwe know singulars we do so by a separate intellectual faculty distinct from\nsense perception \u2013 in favour of a position that saw intuitive and sensory \ncognition as very much interrelated, and this, in turn, followed from a rejection\nof Ockham\u2019s position that the sensitive and intellectual souls were distinct \n(Schierbaum 2016).\n4. Causality, Knowledge and Necessity\n\n\nThere is a persistent supposition \u2013 see, for example, (Gilson\n1937) \u2013 that Ockham, and many of his fourteenth-century\nfollowers, had a basically Humean position on causality; this\nsupposition has deep historical roots (Nadler 1996), but is inaccurate\n(Adams 1987, pp.  741ff.).\n\n\nThe supposedly Humean position has three basic assertions: that\nthere is nothing more to causality than the regular sequence of\nphenomena, that such a regular sequence cannot give a necessary\nconnection, and that, consequently, we can have no certain knowledge of\ncausal relations.\n\n\nOne item in this chain of argument has some textual support in\nOckham: he did not believe that the relation of efficient causality was\na thing distinct from its relata (Ockham,\nQuodlibet VI, qu. 12: Opera Theologica IX, pp.\n629ff.) However, one can still believe this and hold that causality is\na real relation, and Ockham did so believe (Adams 1987, p.\n744; White 1990b). So this link in the chain is not found in\nOckham.\n\n\nThe \u201cHumean\u201d argument, in addition, makes a detour through\npsychology: as Adams analyses it, it relies on a premise like \u201cThere\ncan be nothing more in concepts than there actually is in intuitions\u201d\n(Adams 1987, p. 744). But such a detour through psychology, though\nwidely practiced in the eighteenth century, was somewhat foreign to\nmedieval thought (White 1990a). And one should generally be very\ncircumspect in interpreting medieval texts on issues like\nthese: key terms tend to be used in subtly different ways \nthan in the modern literature, and controversies tend to be\nabout issues which are rather different from our controversies\n(Zupko 2001).\n\n\nEven though pseudo-Humean arguments of this sort cannot reasonably\nbe ascribed to Ockham or to most other medieval thinkers \u2013 with the\npossible exception of Nicholas of Autrecourt \u2013 there still remains the\nquestion of what their views on these questions actually were. Since\nthe medievals generally did not conflate ontological and\nepistemological issues, there are two questions: first about the\nnecessity of causality, and second about whether we can know causal\npropositions with certainty.\n4.1 Causality and Necessity\n\n\nMedieval thinkers believed that the world was created by God, and so\na question like \u201cIs proposition P contingent?\u201d were seen as equivalent\nto the question \u201cCould God have created a world in which P does not\nhold?\u201d. So our question can be reduced to one about divine power.\n\n\nA very common theme in medieval thought is the distinction between\nGod\u2019s absolute and ordered, or ordained, power (potentia\nabsoluta and potentia ordinata). This distinction goes\nback to early medieval thought (Moonan 1994), and was extensively used\nin later medieval philosophy (Courtenay 1971; Adams 1987, pp.\n1186ff.).\n\n\nGod\u2019s absolute power is unrestricted power. According to this power,\nGod can create a huge variety of possible worlds. One frequently used\nprinciple is this: given two distinct entities, God can create a world\nin which one of them, but not the other, exists, or, in this\nworld, God can destroy one of them, leaving the other intact. We should\nnote that this is not exactly innocuous; ontologically, it amounts to\nsome sort of logical atomism. See (White 1990b).\n\n\nBut God will, in practice, not exercise absolute power: as Aquinas\nputs it, \u201cwhat is attributed to the divine power insofar as the command\nof a just will executes it, God is said to be able to do with respect\nto His ordered power\u201d. (Aquinas, Summa theologiae I, qu. 25,\na. 5, ad 1) So there are limits to God\u2019s ordained power (which come\nfrom the concept of a just agent): inside the space of worlds which God\ncould create by absolute power, there is a space of worlds which could\nbe created by ordered power. It is this smaller space of worlds which\nis relevant for our question of the necessity of causal connections.\nAnd, with respect to God\u2019s ordered power, there was a wide range of\ncausal assertions which were regarded as necessary by medieval\nthinkers.\nOne of the significant aspects of this distinction was that \u2013\nentirely apart from its theological motivation \u2013 it gave\nmedieval authors very powerful and flexible analytical tools. \nBuridan, for example, deploys this distinction in a very subtle\nanalysis of some extremely obscure arguments in Aristotle (Knuuttila 2001).\nScotus uses different, but related, arguments to investigate\nmodal questions such as that of the contingency of the\npresent. To some extent (although there is\nconsiderable argument about this area) these methods allowed\na far-reaching reformulation of the metaphysics of modality \n(Normore 2003; cf. Knuuttila 1993). \n\n4.2 Knowing Causal Propositions: Demonstration\n\n\nAs far as our knowledge of causal propositions is concerned, we can\nagain draw a distinction. One question is this: do medieval thinkers,\nin practice, establish causal propositions on the basis of argument?\nAnd the other is this: what sort of metatheory of causal argument do\nthe medievals have?\n\n\nThe answer to the first question is quite straightforward. Ockham,\nlike other fourteenth-century theologians \n\u2013 see, for example,  (Biard 2000) on Buridan \u2013 frequently gives instances\nwhere we can make reliable causal inferences and come to know causal\npropositions on the basis of experience (Ockham, Ordinatio\nPrologue, qu. 2: Opera Theologica I, p. 87) These arguments\nfrequently rely on a theory of natural kinds: for example, Ockham\nwrites\nBecause someone sees that, after eating such an herb,\nhealth follows for someone with a fever, and because he can eliminate\nall other causes of health for that person, he knows evidently that\nthat herb was the cause of health; and thus he has knowledge\n(experimentum) in the singular case. It is, however, obvious\nto him that all individuals of the same kind have an effect of the same\nkind in a patient of the same kind; and thus he assents evidently, as\nto a principle, that every herb of such a kind cures fever. (Ockham,\nOrdinatio prologue, qu. 2: Opera Theologica I, p.\n87)\n\n\nThe second question is that of a metatheory. Here the story becomes\nsomewhat more complicated. There was a generally accepted metatheory,\nnamely that of Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics, according to\nwhich scientific demonstrations were syllogistic proofs, based on\nnecessary and self-evident premises. There were two sorts of these:\nproofs of the simple fact (demonstrationes quia) and proofs of\nthe reasoned fact (demonstrationes propter quid). In the\nlatter, the syllogisms involved must have middle terms that are\ncauses of the state of affairs which is to be demonstrated.\nThis gives a theory of scientific reasoning in which the structure of\nthe arguments is intimately tied up with the structure of the causal\nchains that they demonstrate.\n\n\nThere is, indeed, an extensive literature of medieval commentaries\non the Posterior Analytics, and much of this literature is\nvery important; we find in it a great deal of material on the authors\u2019\nattitudes to necessity, the structure of science, the relation between\nvarious sciences, the autonomy of philosophy vis-\u00e0-vis\ntheology, and the like. However, it cannot be taken to be automatically\nrelevant to the practice of reasoning in the Middle Ages: the\nlogical metatheory (that of the syllogism) is far too restrictive, and\nthe conditions placed on scientific demonstrations are far too\nstringent, for it to be a plausible description of very many actual\nprocesses of reasoning, in the Middle Ages or at any other time.\n5. Final Causes\n\n\nWe often find in Aristotle and in the literature influenced by him\nan enumeration of four types of cause: formal, material, efficient and\nfinal. The first two are uses of \u2018cause\u2019 in a somewhat\nwider sense than is current nowadays: the term here simply means\n\u2018explanation in general\u2019 (Ockham, Expositio\nPhysicorum II, c11: Opera Philosophica IV, p. 348), and\nexplanations by means of matter and form were common both in Aristotle\nand in the literature. Efficient causes are what we would now simply\ncall \u2018causes\u2019. Final causes, however, are problematic: a\nfinal cause is an end or a purpose, and, whereas it is clear that\nrational agents act for the sake of ends, it is not clear that\nmuch else does. Furthermore, it also seems clear to us that the\ncausality of a rationally pursued goal can be reduced to efficient\ncausality.\n\n\nAristotle, however, has a much stronger position on final causality:\nhe believes that there are processes in nature (the growing of a tree,\nfor example) which are completed and regulated by a final state, or\nend, towards which they tend. As Adams puts it,\nAccording to Aristotelian metaphysics, natures are\ncomplexes of powers. When appropriately coordinated, the collective\nexercise of such powers converges on an end. In the sublunary world,\nelemental powers are simple and deterministic. Even where more complex\nliving things are concerned, the \u201ccoordination\u201d of their\npowers is \u201cbuilt-in\u201d in such a fashion that \u2013 given\nrelevant circumstances \u2013 they function to achieve their\nend. (Adams 1996, p. 499)\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s natural science tends to be governed by the biological\nparadigm, and it is clear that, for him, final causes in this strong\nsense are extremely pervasive. He also argues in the Physics\nthat natural processes cannot all be explained by final causality\nalone, which implies that final causality cannot, in general, be\nreduced to efficient causality.\n\n\nThe medieval literature is far from unanimous on these questions.\nWilliam of Ockham, for example, who wrote several commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, and who discusses these questions at\nnumerous places in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics,\nhardly has a uniform position. He is quite happy with explanations of\nnatural phenomena by means of efficient causes in general, but he will\nalso often speak of final causes: what is unclear is whether the final\ncauses he speaks of (with varying degrees of strength in different\nworks) have any explanatory role to play that cannot be reduced to\nefficient causality (Adams 1998; cf. Goddu 1999).\n",
