At first glance, this seems like an easy\nquestion to answer. Homo sapiens is a species, and so is\nCanis familiaris. Many species can be easily distinguished.\nWhen we turn to the scientific literature on species, the nature of\nspecies becomes much less clear. Biologists offer over twenty\ndefinitions of the term \u2018species\u2019 (Hey 2001). These\ndefinitions are not fringe accounts of species but prominent\ndefinitions in the biological literature. Philosophers also disagree\non the nature of species. Their primary concern is the ontological\nstatus of species. Some philosophers believe that species are natural\nkinds. Others maintain that species are particulars or\nindividuals.\n\nThe concept of species plays an important role both in and outside of\nbiology. Within biology, species are the fundamental units of\nbiological classification. Species are also units of\nevolution\u2014groups of organisms that evolve in a unified way.\nOutside of biology, the concept of species plays a role in debates\nover environmental law and ecological preservation. Our conception of\nspecies even affects our understanding of human nature. From a\nbiological perspective humans are the species Homo\nsapiens.\n\nThis entry discusses a number of philosophical issues concerning\nspecies. The first issue is their ontological status. Are species\nnatural kinds, individuals, or sets? The second issue concerns species\npluralism. Monists argue that biologists should attempt to find the\ncorrect definition of \u2018species.\u2019 Pluralists disagree. They\nargue that there is no single correct definition of\n\u2018species\u2019 but a plurality of equally correct definitions.\nThe third issue concerns the reality of species. Does the term\n\u2018species\u2019 refer to a real category in nature? Or, as some\nphilosophers and biologists argue, is the term \u2018species\u2019 a\ntheoretically empty designation? The fourth and final issue concerns\nhow social values affect which definitions of \u2018species\u2019\nbiologists use. \n2. The Ontological Status of Species\n2.1 The Death of Essentialism\n\nSince Aristotle, species have been paradigmatic examples of natural\nkinds with essences. An essentialist approach to species makes sense\nin a pre Darwinian context. God created species and an eternal essence\nfor each species. After God\u2019s initial creation, each species is\na static, not an evolving group of organisms. Darwinism offers a\ndifferent view of species. Species are the result of speciation. No\nqualitative feature\u2014morphological, genetic, or\nbehavioral\u2014is considered essential for membership in a species.\nDespite this change in biological thinking, many philosophers still\nbelieve that species are natural kinds with essences. Let us start\nwith a brief introduction to kind essentialism and then turn to the\nbiological reasons why species fail to have essences.\n\nKind essentialism has a number of tenets. One tenet is that all and\nonly the members of a kind have a common essence. A second tenet is\nthat the essence of a kind is responsible for the traits typically\nassociated with the members of that kind. For example, gold\u2019s\natomic structure is responsible for gold\u2019s disposition to melt\nat certain temperatures. Third, knowing a kind\u2019s essence helps\nus explain and predict those properties typically associated with a\nkind. The application of any of these tenets to species is\nproblematic. But to see the failure of essentialism we need only\nconsider the first tenet.\n\nBiologists have had a hard time finding biological traits that occur\nin all and only the members of a species. Even such pre Darwinian\nessentialists as Linnaeus could not locate the essences of species\n(Ereshefsky 2001). Evolutionary theory explains why. A number of\nforces conspire against the universality and uniqueness of a trait in\na species (Hull 1965). Suppose a genetically based trait were found in\nall the members of a species. The forces of mutation, recombination,\nand random drift can cause the disappearance of that trait in a future\nmember of the species. All it takes is the disappearance of a trait in\none member of a species to show that it is not essential. The\nuniversality of a biological trait in a species is fragile.\n\nSuppose, nevertheless, that a trait occurs in all the members of a\nspecies. That trait is the essence of a species only if it is unique\nto that species. Yet organisms in different species often have common\ncharacteristics. Again, biological forces work against the uniqueness\nof a trait within a single species. Organisms in related species\ninherit similar genes and developmental programs from their common\nancestors. These common stores of developmental resources cause a\nnumber of similarities in the organisms of different species. Another\nsource of similar traits in different species is parallel evolution.\nSpecies frequently live in similar habitats with comparable selection\npressures. Those selection pressures cause the prominence of similar\ntraits in more than one species. The parallel evolution of opposable\nthumbs in primates and pandas is an example.\n\nThe existence of various evolutionary forces does not rule out the\npossibility of a trait occurring in all and only the members of a\nspecies. But consider the conditions such a trait must satisfy. A\nspecies\u2019 essential trait must occur in all the members of a\nspecies for the entire life of that species. Moreover, if that trait\nis to be unique to that species, it cannot occur in any other species\nfor the entire existence of life on this planet. The temporal\nparameters that species essentialism must satisfy are quite broad. The\noccurrence of a biological trait in all and only the members of a\nspecies is an empirical possibility. But given current biological\ntheory, that possibility is unlikely.\n\nOther arguments have been mustered against species essentialism. Hull\n(1965) contends that species have vague boundaries and that such\nvagueness is incompatible with the existence of species specific\nessences. According to Hull, essentialist definitions of natural kinds\nrequire strict boundaries between those kinds. But the boundaries\nbetween species are vague. In all but a few cases, speciation is a\nlong and gradual process such that there is no principled way to draw\na precise boundary between one species and the next. As a result,\nspecies cannot be given essentialist definitions. (Hull\u2019s\nargument against species essentialism is very similar to one of\nLocke\u2019s (1690[1975], III, vi) arguments against kind\nessentialism.)\n\nSober (1980) raises a different objection to species essentialism. He\nillustrates how essentialist explanations have been replaced by\nevolutionary ones. Essentialists explain variation within a species as\nthe result of interference in the ontogenetic development of\nparticular members of that species. Organisms have species specific\nessences, but interference often prevents the manifestations of those\nessences. Contemporary geneticists offer a different explanation of\nvariation within a species. They cite the gene frequencies of a\nspecies as well as the evolutionary forces that affect those\nfrequencies. No species specific essences are posited. Contemporary\nbiology can explain variation within a species without positing a\nspecies\u2019 essence. So according to Sober, species essentialism\nhas become theoretically superfluous.\n\nIn a pre Darwinian age, species essentialism made sense. Such\nessentialism, however, is out of step with contemporary evolutionary\ntheory. Evolutionary theory provides its own methods for explaining\nvariation within a species. It tells us that the boundaries between\nspecies are vague. And it tells us that a number of forces conspire\nagainst the existence of a trait in all and only the members of a\nspecies. From a biological perspective, species essentialism is no\nlonger a plausible position. Nevertheless, as we shall see in Section\n2.5, some philosophers have recently tried to revive species\nessentialism.\n2.2 Species as Individuals\n\nLet us turn to a popular view among philosophers and biologists\nconcerning the ontological status of species. Ghiselin (1974) and Hull\n(1978) suggest that instead of viewing species as natural kinds we\nshould think of them as individuals. Hull draws the ontological\ndistinction this way. (Instead of the phrase \u2018natural\nkind,\u2019 Hull uses the term \u2018class.\u2019) Classes are\ngroups of entities that can function in scientific laws. One\nrequirement of such laws is that they are true at any time and at any\nplace in the universe. If \u2018All copper conducts\nelectricity\u2019 is a law, then that law is true here and now, as\nwell as 100,000 years ago on some distant planet. Copper is a class\nbecause samples of copper are spatiotemporally unrestricted\n\u2014copper can occur anywhere in the universe. Individuals, unlike\nclasses, consist of parts that are spatiotemporally restricted. Think\nof a paradigmatic individual, a single mammalian organism. The parts\nof that organism cannot be scattered around the universe at different\ntimes if they are parts of a living, functioning organism. Various\nbiological processes, such as digestion and respiration, require that\nthose parts be causally and spatiotemporally connected. The parts of\nsuch an organism can only exist in a particular space-time region. In\nbrief, individuals consist of parts that are spatiotemporally\nrestricted. Classes consist of members that are spatiotemporally\nunrestricted.\n\nGiven the class/individual distinction, Ghiselin and Hull argue that\nspecies are individuals, not classes. Their argument assumes that the\nterm \u2018species\u2019 is a theoretical term in evolutionary\ntheory, so their argument focuses on the role of \u2018species\u2019\nin that theory. Here is Hull\u2019s version of the argument, which\ncan be dubbed the \u2018evolutionary unit argument.\u2019 Since\nDarwin, species have been considered units of evolution. When Hull\nasserts that species are units of evolution, he does not simply mean\nthat the gene frequencies of a species change from one generation to\nthe next. He has a more significant form of evolution in mind, namely\na trait going from being rare to being prominent in a species. A\nnumber of processes can cause a trait to become prominent in a\nspecies. Hull highlights selection. Selection causes a trait to become\nprominent in a species only if that trait is passed down from one\ngeneration to the next. If a trait is not heritable, the frequency of\nthat trait will not increase cumulatively. Hereditary relations,\ngenetic or otherwise, require the generations of a species to be\ncausally and hence spatiotemporally connected. So, if species are to\nevolve in non trivial ways by natural selection, they must be\nspatiotemporally continuous entities. Given that species are units of\nevolution, species are individuals and not classes. (For responses to\nthe Evolutionary Unit Argument see Dupr\u00e9 2001, Reydon 2003,\nCrane 2004, and Crawford 2008.)\n\nThe conclusion that species are individuals has a number of\ninteresting implications. For one, the relationship between an\norganism and its species is not a member/class relation but a\npart/whole relation. An organism belongs to a particular species only\nif it is appropriately causally connected to the other organisms in\nthat species. The organisms of a species must be parts of a single\nevolving lineage. If belonging to a species turns on an\norganism\u2019s insertion in a lineage, then qualitative similarity\ncan be misleading. Two organisms may be very similar morphologically,\ngenetically, and behaviorally, but unless they belong to the same\nspatiotemporally continuous lineage they cannot belong to the same\nspecies. Think of an analogy. Being part of my immediate family turns\non my wife, my children and I having certain biological relations to\none another, not our having similar features. It does not matter that\nmy son\u2019s best friend looks just like him. That friend is not\npart of our family. Similarly, organisms belong to a particular\nspecies because they are appropriately causally connected, not because\nthey look similar.\n\nAnother implication of the species are individuals thesis concerns our\nconception of human nature (Hull 1978). As we have seen, species are\nfirst and foremost genealogical lineages. An organism belongs to a\nspecies because it is part of a lineage not because it has a\nparticular qualitative feature. Humans may be a number of things. One\nof them is being the species Homo sapiens. From an\nevolutionary perspective, there is no biological essence to being a\nhuman. There is no essential feature that all and only humans must\nhave to be part of Homo sapiens. Humans are not essentially\nrational beings or social animals or ethical agents. An organism can\nbe born without any of these features and still be a human. From a\nbiological perspective, being part of the lineage Homo\nsapiens is both necessary and sufficient for being a human. (For\nfurther implications of the individuality thesis, see Hull 1978,\nBuller 2005, Haber 2016.)\n2.3 Species as Sets\n\nSome philosophers think that Hull and Ghiselin too quickly dismiss the\nassumption that species are natural kinds. Kitcher (1984) believes\nthat species are sets of organisms. Thinking of species as sets is an\nontologically neutral stance. It allows that some species are\nspatiotemporally restricted sets of organisms, that is, individuals.\nAnd it allows that other species are spatiotemporally unrestricted\nsets of organisms.\n\nWhy does Kitcher believe that some species are individuals and other\nspecies are spatiotemporally unrestricted sets? Following the\nbiologist Ernst Mayr, Kitcher suggests that there are two fundamental\ntypes of explanation in biology: those that cite proximate\ncauses and those that cite ultimate causes. Proximate\nexplanations cite the more immediate cause of a trait, for example,\nthe genes or developmental pathways that cause the occurrence of a\ntrait in an organism. Ultimate explanations cite the evolutionary\ncause of a trait in a species, for example, the selection forces that\ncaused the evolution of thumbs in pandas and their ancestors.\n\nFor each type of explanation, Kitcher believes that there are\ncorresponding definitions of the term \u2018species\u2019 (what\nbiologists call \u2018species concepts\u2019). Proximate\nexplanations cite species concepts based on structural similarities,\nsuch as genetic, chromosomal and developmental similarities. These\nspecies concepts assume that species are spatiotemporally unrestricted\nsets of organisms. Ultimate explanations cite species concepts that\nassign species evolutionary roles. These species concepts assume that\nspecies are lineages and thus individuals.\n\nKitcher is correct that biologists attempt to explain the traits of\norganisms in two ways: sometimes they cite the ultimate, or\nevolutionary, cause of a trait; other times they cite a structural\nfeature of an organism with that trait. A problem with Kitcher\u2019s\napproach is his characterization of biological practice. Biologists\nsince Darwin have taken species to be evolutionary units. A glance at\na biology text book will reveal that the evolutionary approach to\nspecies is the going concern in biology. The groups that correspond to\nKitcher\u2019s structural concepts are not considered species by\ntaxonomists. Groups of organisms that have genetic, developmental,\nbehavioral and ecological similarities, are natural kinds in biology,\nbut they are not considered species. Consider such groups of organisms\nas males, females, tree nesters and diploid organisms. These groups of\norganisms cut across species. For instance, some but not all humans\nare males and many organisms in other species are males. Male is a\nkind in biology, but it is not a species. Kitcher\u2019s motivation\nfor asserting that species are sets is to allow spatiotemporally\nunrestricted groups of organisms to form species. That motivation,\nhowever, is not substantiated by biological theory or practice.\n2.4 Species as Homeostatic Property Cluster Kinds\n\nAnother response to the species are individuals thesis is offered by\nproponents of an alternative approach to natural kinds. According to\nBoyd (1999a, 1999b), Griffiths (1999), Wilson (1999), Millikan (1999),\nand Wilson et al. (2007), species are natural kinds on a\nproper conception of natural kinds. These authors adopt Boyd\u2019s\nHomeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) theory of natural kinds. HPC theory\nassumes that natural kinds are groups of entities that share stable\nsimilarities. HPC theory does not require that species are defined by\ntraditional essential properties. The members of Canis\nfamiliaris, for example, tend to share a number of common\nproperties (having four legs, two eyes, and so on), but given the\nforces of evolution, no biological property is essential for\nmembership in that species. For HPC theory, the similarities among the\nmembers of a kind must be stable enough to allow better than chance\npredictions about the properties found among the members of a kind.\nFor instance, given that we know that Lizzy is a dog, we can predict\nwith greater than chance probability that Lizzy will have four\nlegs.\n\nHPC kinds are more than groups of entities that share stable clusters\nof similarities. HPC kinds also contain \u201chomeostatic causal\nmechanisms\u201d that are responsible for the similarities found\namong the members of a kind. The members of a biological species\ninterbreed, share common developmental programs, and are exposed to\ncommon selection regimes. These \u201chomeostatic mechanisms\u201d\ncause the members of a species to have similar features. Dogs, for\ninstance, tend to have four legs and two eyes because they share\ngenetic material and are exposed to common environmental pressures. An\nHPC kind consists of entities that share similarities induced by that\nkind\u2019s homeostatic mechanisms. According to Boyd, species are\nHPC kinds and thus natural kinds because \u201cspecies are defined\n\u2026 by \u2026 shared properties and by the mechanisms\n(including both \u201dexternal\u201c mechanisms and genetic\ntransmission) which sustain their homeostasis\u201d (1999b, 81).\n\nHPC theory provides a more promising account of species as natural\nkinds than essentialism. HPC kinds need not have a common essential\nproperty, so the criticisms of species essentialism are avoided.\nFurthermore, HPC theory allows that external relations play a\nsignificant role in causing similarity among the members of a kind.\nTraditional essentialism assumes that the essence of a kind is an\ninternal or intrinsic property of a kind\u2019s members, such as the\natomic structure of gold or the DNA of tigers. HPC theory is more\ninclusive because it recognizes that both the internal properties of\norganisms and the external relations of organisms are important causes\nof species-wide similarities. For instance, HPC theory but not\nessentialism cites interbreeding as a fundamental cause of similarity\namong the organisms of many species.\n\nWhile HPC theory is better at capturing the features of species than\nessentialism, does HPC theory provide an adequate account of species\nas natural kinds? Here are two potential problems with HPC theory. HPC\ntheory\u2019s objective is to explain the existence of stable\nsimilarities within groups of entities. However, species are also\ncharacterized by persistent differences. Polymorphism (stable\nvariation within a species) is an important feature of nearly every\nspecies. Species polymorphisms are easy to find. Consider sexual\ndimorphism: within any mammalian species there are pronounced\ndifferences between males and females. Or consider polymorphism in the\nlife cycles of organisms. The lives of organisms consist of\ndramatically different life stages, such as the difference between the\ncaterpillar and butterfly stages of a single organism. HPC theorists\nrecognize the existence of polymorphism, but they do not recognize\npolymorphism as a central feature of species in need of explanation.\nHPC theorists privilege and attempt to explain similarities. In\naddition to Boyd\u2019s \u2018homeostatic\u2019 mechanisms we need\nto recognize \u2018heterostatic\u2019 mechanisms that maintain\nspecies variation. (For further discussion of polymorphism in species\nsee Ereshefsky and Matthen 2005 and Magnus 2008.)\n\nA second concern with HPC theory involves the identity conditions of\nspecies. The members of a species vary in their traits. Moreover, they\nvary in their homeostatic mechanisms. Over time and across geographic\nregions, the members of a single species are often exposed to\ndifferent homeostatic mechanisms. Given such variation, what causes\norganisms with different traits and exposed to different homeostatic\nmechanisms to be members of the same species? The common answer is\ngenealogy: the members of a species form a continuous genealogical\nentity on the tree of life. A species\u2019 homeostatic mechanisms\nare mechanisms of one species because they affect organisms that form\na unique lineage. Boyd and promoters of HPC theory recognize the\nimportance of genealogy and see historical relations as one type of\nhomeostatic mechanism. However, Boyd does not see genealogy as the\ndefining aspect of species, and this goes against a fundamental\nassumption of biological systematics: species are first and foremost\ncontinuous genealogical entities. Boyd is quite clear that similarity\nand not genealogical connectedness is the final arbitrator of species\nsameness (1999b, 80). This assumption makes sense given that Boyd\nbelieves that species are kinds and kinds are ultimately\nsimilarity-based classes that play a role in induction. But this view\nof the identity conditions of species conflicts with the standard view\nin biological systematics that species are continuous genealogical\nlineages (Ereshefsky 2007).\n2.5 The New Biological Essentialism\n\nGriffiths (1999), Okasha (2002), and LaPorte (2004) have suggested a\nform of species essentialism which can be called \u2018relational\nessentialism\u2019. According to relational essentialism, certain\nrelations among organisms, or between organisms and the environment,\nare necessary and sufficient for membership in a species. Such\nrelations, argue Griffiths, Okasha, and LaPorte, are species essences.\nFor example, they suggest that being descendent from a particular\nancestor is necessary and sufficient for being a member of a\nspecies.\n\nDevitt (2008) rejects relational essentialism. He argues that\nrelational essentialism fails to answer two crucial questions. The\ntaxon question: Why is organism O a member of species\nS? The trait question: Why do members of species S\ntypically have trait T? Devitt suggests that to answer these\nquestions species need intrinsic essences; and because relational\nessentialism only posits relational essences, relational essentialism\nfails to answer these questions. Devitt\u2019s target is not merely\nto discredit relational essentialism, but also to argue for a new form\nof intrinsic biological essentialism. According to Devitt (2008), a\nspecies\u2019 essence is the cluster of intrinsic properties and\nperhaps the relations that cause the typical traits of a taxon\u2019s\nmembers. Let us consider Devitt\u2019s critique of relational\nessentialism. In doing so, we will learn about both relational\nessentialism and Devitt\u2019s intrinsic biological essentialism.\n\nRecall the trait question: Why do zebras have stripes? Devitt (2008,\n352ff.) argues that explanations that merely cite relations are\ninsufficient to explain the traits typically found among zebras. We\nmust cite intrinsic properties as well, and such properties are\nessential intrinsic properties of zebras. Devitt is right that we need\nto cite more than relations to explain why zebras have stripes.\nGenerally, to explain the occurrence of a homologue, such as stripes\nin zebras, we need to cite both relations among organisms and\nintrinsic factors within organisms. More precisely, embryonic zebras\nhave developmental mechanisms that cause zebras to have stripes. These\nmechanisms are intrinsic features of embryonic zebras. But those\ndevelopmental mechanisms must be passed down from parent to offspring,\nvia genealogical relations. So a robust explanation of why zebras have\nstripes cites both the relations and intrinsic properties that cause\nstripes.\n\nGiven the observation that we should cite both genealogy and\ndevelopmental mechanisms to understand why zebras have stripes, should\nwe infer, as Devitt does, that the taxon Zebra has an intrinsic\nessence? Some argue \u2018no\u2019 (Ereshefsky 2010a). Biologists\nexplain the characters of organisms by citing other characters,\nwithout the added metaphysical claim that a character cited in an\nexplanans is essential for membership in a taxon. Consider how a\nbiologist explains the occurrence of stripes in a zebra. In its\nembryonic state, a zebra has an ontogenetic mechanism that causes it\nto develop stripes. That developmental mechanism is neither necessary\nnor sufficient for membership in Zebra. Some zebras lack that\nmechanism. Moreover, the developmental mechanism that causes stripes\nin zebras causes stripes in a variety of mammals, including cats.\nGenerally, the intrinsic properties that cause organismic traits do\nnot coincide with taxonomic boundaries: they cross-cut such\nboundaries. The belief that such intrinsic properties are essential\nfor taxon membership is not part of biological theory.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the taxon question: Why are certain organisms\nmembers of species S? Relational essentialists argue that\nmodern species concepts posit relational properties, such as\ninterbreeding, genealogy, and occupying a specific niche, as the\ndefining features of species. Relational essentialists tell us that\nbiologists do not posit intrinsic properties as the defining features\nof species. Devitt responds (2008) that citing the relations among the\norganisms of a species does not explain why particular organisms are\nmembers of a certain species. According to Devitt, saying that\norganism O can interbreed with other Homo sapiens\nleaves unanswered why those other organisms are Homo sapiens.\nThen there\u2019s an unanswered regress: why are any of them Homo\nsapiens? According to Devitt, to answer that question we must\ncite essential intrinsic properties in organisms.\n\nHas Devitt made the case for intrinsic essentialism? Perhaps not. Once\nagain, why are certain organisms members of species S?\nAccording to our best biological theory, if S is an\ninterbreeding species, then those organisms have intrinsic\nreproductive mechanisms that allow them to interbreed with one\nanother. However, we do not know which intrinsic mechanisms are\nmechanisms that cause an organism to be a member of a particular\nspecies. We need some way of determining which mechanisms cause an\norganism to be a member of one species versus a member of another\nspecies. Here we must turn to relations: particular population and\ngenealogical relations among organisms. The answer to why particular\nreproductive mechanisms are mechanisms of species S is that\nthose mechanisms occur in organisms whose populations are\ngenealogically connected in a single lineage. Relations are\nexplanatorily prior in explaining taxon identity, not intrinsic\nproperties.\n\nTo reinforce this point, consider which aspects of an organism can be\nchanged while it remains a member of the same species, and which\naspects cannot be changed. The intrinsic reproductive mechanisms\nwithin the organisms of a species can be changed, but being part of\nthe same lineage or gene pool cannot be changed. To make this more\nconcrete consider the case of ring species. A ring species consists of\na geographic ring of populations such that organisms in contiguous\npopulations can successfully mate, but organisms in populations at\ndistant links in the ring cannot successfully mate. The organisms in\ndistant populations of a ring species have different reproductive\nmechanisms (Mayr 1963, 512ff.). Suppose Joe is a member of a ring\nspecies. Joe could have had a different intrinsic reproductive\nmechanism than the one he has. Imagine counterfactually that he is a\nmember of a different population of his ring species, namely one with\ndifferent reproductive mechanisms than those found in his actual\npopulation. In this counterfactual situation Joe is still a member of\nhis species so long as we do not remove him from the lineage and gene\npool of that ring species. Generally, an organism in a species can\nhave a different reproductive mechanism and still be a part of that\nspecies. But an organism cannot be removed from its original lineage\nand put in another lineage and remain part of the original species.\nWhen it comes to species membership, intrinsic mechanisms within the\norganisms of a species can vary, but certain relations among its\norganisms cannot vary (Ereshefsky 2010a). (For more critiques of\nDevitt\u2019s intrinsic essentialism see Barker 2010 and Lewens 2012.\nFor Devitt\u2019s response to those criticisms see Devitt 2021.)\n\nDo the results of this section thus far imply that relational\nessentialism is correct? Consider two traditional requirements of\nessentialism highlighted by Okasha (2002). The membership requirement:\nthe essence of a kind provides the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor membership in that kind. The explanatory requirement: citing a\nkind\u2019s essence is central in explaining the properties typically\nassociated with the members of that kind. Given these two requirements\nOkasha offers the following argument. Because certain relations are\nnecessary and sufficient for membership in a species, such relations\nsatisfy the membership requirement of essentialism. However, those\nrelations do not satisfy the explanatory requirement. According to\nOkasha, relations such as genealogy and interbreeding fail to explain\nthe traits typically found among the members of a species. Instead, we\nmust cite the \u201cgenotype and its developmental environment\u201d\n(2002, 204) to explain such traits. Despite failing to meet the\nexplanatory requirement, Okasha thinks that certain relations are\ntaxon essences. Okasha writes that there is no a priori\nreason to retain the explanatory requirement of essentialism and\nsuggests that it should be dropped. With the explanatory requirement\nout of the way and the membership requirement satisfied, Okasha\nconcludes that species have relational essences.\n\nA potential problem with Okasha\u2019s relational essentialism is\nthat if the relations that serve as the identity conditions for a\nspecies are not central in explaining the typical traits among a\nspecies\u2019 members, then such relations are not essences. Okasha\njettisons a core feature of essentialism: that the essence of a kind\nplays a central role in explaining the typical features of a\nkind\u2019s members. Essentialists, from Aristotle to Locke, from\nKripke to Devitt, believe that essences figure centrally in explaining\nthe traits typically found among the members of a kind. If we give up\nthat explanatory component of essentialism we give up a core feature\nof essentialism, a feature that distinguishes real essences from\nnominal essences. Nominal essences demarcate membership in a kind, but\nthey do not explain the typical traits of a kind. Arguably, any\napproach to natural kinds that aims to capture the kinds of science\nshould preserve this explanatory feature of kinds. So in the end,\nrelational essentialism may not be essentialism because it fails to\nsatisfy a core aim of essentialism. (For a detailed response to\nOkasha\u2019s relational essentialism see Pedroso 2014.)\n3. Species Pluralism\n\nBiologists offer various definitions of the term \u2018species\u2019\n(Claridge, Dawah, and Wilson 1997). Biologists call these different\ndefinitions \u2018species concepts.\u2019 Consider three of these\nconcepts. The Biological Species Concept defines a species as a group\nof organisms that can successfully interbreed and produce fertile\noffspring. The Phylogenetic Species Concept (which has multiple\nversions) defines a species as a group of organisms bound by a unique\nancestry. The Ecological Species Concept defines a species as a group\nof organisms that share a distinct ecological niche. These species\nconcepts are just three among over a dozen prominent species concepts\nin the biological literature.\n\nWhat are we to make of this variety of species concepts? Monists\nbelieve that an aim of biological taxonomy is to identify the single\ncorrect species concept. Perhaps that concept is among the species\nconcepts currently proposed and we need to determine which concept is\nthe right one. Or perhaps we have not yet found the correct species\nconcept and we need to wait for further progress in biology.\nPluralists take a different stance. They do not believe that there is\na single correct species concept. Biology, they argue, contains a\nnumber of legitimate species concepts. Pluralists believe that the\nmonist\u2019s goal of a single correct species concept should be\nabandoned.\n3.1 Varieties of Pluralism\n\nSpecies pluralism comes in various forms (for example, Kitcher 1984,\nMishler and Brandon 1987, Dupr\u00e9 1993, and Ereshefsky 2001).\nKitcher and Dupr\u00e9 offer forms of species pluralism that\nrecognize the species concepts mentioned above\u2014biological\nspecies, phylogenetic species, and ecological species\u2014as well as\nother species concepts. As we saw in Section 1.2, Kitcher accepts\nspecies concepts that require species to be individuals, and he\naccepts species concepts based on the structural similarities of\norganisms. The latter type of species are not spatiotemporally\ncontinuous entities. Such species merely need to contain organisms\nthat share theoretically significant properties. Dupr\u00e9\u2019s\nversion of species pluralism is more robust. He recognizes all of the\nspecies concepts found in Kitcher\u2019s version of pluralism.\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s pluralism also allows species concepts based on\nsimilarities highlighted by non biologists. For example, Dupr\u00e9\naccepts species concepts based on gastronomically significant\nproperties.\n\nIf one thinks that the term \u2018species\u2019 is a theoretical\nterm found within evolutionary biology, then one might find\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s version of pluralism too promiscuous. If the\nquestion is how the term \u2018species\u2019 is defined in biology,\nthen how it is defined outside of biology does not count. Think of a\nparallel situation in physics. When we are interested in the\nscientific meaning of the term \u2018work\u2019 we do not attend to\nits meaning in the sentence \u2018How was work today?\u2019\nSimilarly, the use of the word \u2018species\u2019 by culinary\nexperts does not reveal the theoretical meaning of\n\u2018species.\u2019\n\nKitcher\u2019s pluralism is more circumspect: it limits species\nconcepts to those that are legitimized by theoretical biology. Still,\none might worry that Kitcher\u2019s form of pluralism is too liberal.\nKitcher\u2019s pluralism allows that some species are\nspatiotemporally continuous entities (individuals), while other\nspecies may be spatiotemporally unrestricted entities (natural kinds).\nAs we saw in Section 2.1, Hull\u2019s evolutionary unit argument\nstates that within the purview of evolutionary biology, species must\nbe individuals. Kitcher\u2019s pluralism does not satisfy this\nrequirement. If one assumes that \u2018species\u2019 is a\ntheoretical term in evolutionary theory and that species are\nindividuals, then Kitcher\u2019s pluralism is too inclusive.\n\nAnother version of species pluralism is found in Ereshefsky (2001).\nThis version of pluralism adopts Hull\u2019s conclusion that species\nmust be spatiotemporally continuous lineages. Nevertheless, this\nversion of pluralism asserts that there are different types of\nlineages called \u2018species.\u2019 The Biological Species Concept\nand related concepts highlight those lineages bound by the process of\ninterbreeding. The Phylogenetic Species Concepts highlight those\nlineages of organisms that share a common and unique ancestry.\nEcological approaches to species focus on lineages of organisms that\nare exposed to common sets of stabilizing selection. According to this\nform of species pluralism, the tree of life is segmented by different\nprocesses into different types of species lineages.\n\nIt is worth noting that the motivation behind Dupr\u00e9\u2019s,\nKitcher\u2019s and Ereshefsky\u2019s versions of pluralism is\nontological not epistemological. Some authors (for example, Rosenberg\n1994) suggest that we adopt pluralism because of our epistemological\nlimitations. The world is exceedingly complex and we have limited\ncognitive abilities, so we should accept a plurality of simplified and\ninaccurate classifications of the world. The versions of species\npluralism offered by Dupr\u00e9, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky are not\nepistemologically driven. Evolutionary theory, a well substantiated\ntheory, tells us that the organic world is multifaceted. According to\nDupr\u00e9, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky, species pluralism is a result\nof a fecundity of biological forces rather than a paucity of\nscientific information.\n3.2 Older Responses to Pluralism\n\nNot everyone is willing to accept species pluralism. Monists have\nlaunched a number of objections to species pluralism. (for example,\nSober 1984, Ghiselin 1987, Hull 1987, de Queiroz 1999, Mayden 2002,\nBrigandt 2003, Pigliucci 2003, Wilkins 2003, and Richards 2010) One\nobjection centers on the type of lineage that should be accepted as\nspecies. Some monists allow the existence of different types of base\nlineages but contend that only one type of lineage should be called\n\u2018species\u2019 (Ghiselin 1987). For instance, supporters of the\nBiological Species Concept believe that lineages of interbreeding\nsexual organisms are much more important in the evolution of life on\nthis planet (Eldredge 1985, Lee 2003, Coyne and Orr 2004). They argue\nthat only the Biological Species Concept, or some interbreeding\nconcept, should be accepted.\n\nHowever, adopting only an interbreeding approach to species has its\ncosts: it would exclude all asexual organisms from forming species.\nInterbreeding requires the genetic contributions of two sexual\norganisms. Asexual organisms reproduce by themselves, either through\ncloning, vegetative means, or self fertilization. Some reptiles and\namphibians reproduce asexually. Many insects reproduce asexually. And\nasexuality is rampant in plants, fungi and bacteria. In fact, asexual\nreproduction is the prominent form of reproduction on Earth (Hull\n1988, Templeton 1989). If one adopts an interbreeding approach to\nspecies, then most organisms do not form species. This seems a high\nprice to pay for species monism.\n\nAnother objection to species pluralism is that pluralism is an overly\nliberal position (Sober 1984, Ghiselin 1987, and Hull 1987).\nPluralists allow a number of legitimate species concepts, but how do\npluralists determine which concepts should be accepted as legitimate?\nShould any species concept proposed by a biologist be accepted? What\nabout those concepts proposed by non biologists? Without criteria for\ndetermining the legitimacy of a proposed species concept, species\npluralism boils down to a position of anything goes.\n\nSpecies pluralists respond to this objection by suggesting criteria\nfor judging the legitimacy of a proposed species concept (Dupr\u00e9\n1993, Ereshefsky 2001). Such criteria can be used to determine which\nspecies concepts should be accepted into the plurality of legitimate\nspecies concepts. Candidate criteria are the epistemic virtues that\nscientists typically use for determining the scientific worthiness of\na theory. For example, in judging a species concept, one might ask if\nthe theoretical assumptions of a concept are empirically testable. The\nBiological Species Concept relies on the assumption that interbreeding\ncauses the existence of stable lineages. It also assumes that\norganisms that cannot interbreed do not form stable lineages. Whether\ninterbreeding and only interbreeding causes the existence of stable\nlineages is empirically testable. So the Biological Species Concept\nhas the virtue of empirical sensitivity. Other criteria for judging\nspecies concepts include intertheoretic coherence and internal\nconsistency. Pluralists can provide criteria for discerning which\nconcepts should be accepted as legitimate. Thus the \u2018anything\ngoes\u2019 objection can be answered.\n\nAnother response to species pluralism is de Queiroz\u2019s (1999,\n2005, 2007) General Lineage Concept. De Queiroz suggests that despite\ndifferences among various species concepts, all such concepts agree on\none thing: species are \u201cseparately evolving metapopulation\nlineages\u201d (2005, 1263). De Queiroz writes that this conception\nof species is the \u201csingle, more general, concept of\nspecies\u201d that reconciles all other species concepts (2007, 880).\nWhat is the relationship between the General Lineage Concept and those\nconcepts? De Queiroz suggests that the General Lineage Concept\nprovides the necessary criterion for being a species. The properties\nthat other species concepts disagree over, for example, a\nlineage\u2019s occupying a unique niche, being monophyletic, or being\nreproductively isolated, are contingent properties of species. They\nare \u201csecondary\u201d properties of species (de Queiroz 2005,\n1264). All species taxa must be metapopulation lineages, but they can\nvary in their secondary properties. De Queiroz contrasts the necessary\nproperty of species from their secondary properties in another way.\nWhereas the necessary property cited by the General Species Concept\ncaptures the fundamental nature of species, the secondary properties\nof species are merely \u201coperational criteria\u201d (2007, 882)\nfor \u201cinferring the boundaries and numbers of species\u201d\n(2005, 264). According to de Queiroz, disagreements among other\nspecies concepts merely concern operational and evidential issues.\nProponents of other species concepts are confusing\n\u201cmethodological\u201d disagreements with\n\u201cconceptual\u201d ones (de Queiroz 2005, 1267).\n\nOne concern one might have about de Queiroz\u2019s attempt to unify\nthe species category is that proponents of other species concepts\nwould disagree with de Queiroz\u2019s assertion that their\ndisagreements are merely over evidence for the numbers and boundaries\nof species. Proponents of the interbreeding, ecological and\nphylogenetic approaches believe that they are identifying different\ntypes of lineages (interbreeding lineages, ecological lineages,\nphylogenetic lineages), not merely disagreeing over evidence for the\nsame type of lineage. For example, when supporters of the\ninterbreeding approach say that asexual organisms do not form species\nthey are making a conceptual or ontological claim, not an operational\nclaim. De Queiroz\u2019s unified approach seems to mischaracterize\ndisagreements among proponents of other species concepts.\n\nAnother potential problem is how the General Lineage Concept\ndistinguishes species from higher taxa. According to de Queiroz,\nspecies are single lineages whereas higher taxa are clades of multiple\nlineages. What, then, distinguishes a single lineage from a branch\nwith multiple lineages according to the General Lineage Concept? De\nQueiroz (2005, 1265) writes that the General Lineage Concept does not\nneed to cite the secondary properties mentioned in other species\nconcepts to answer this. However, de Queiroz offers no alternative\ncriteria for determining when a single lineage becomes a branch of\nmultiple lineages. Moreover, the secondary properties of other species\nconcepts are commonly used to make that determination. Therein lies a\npotential problem with the General Lineage Concept\u2019s attempt to\nunify the species category. According to the General Lineage Concept,\nspecies are lineages. But to determine what is a lineage we must turn\nto other species concepts, and in doing so the heterogeneity of the\nspecies category rears its head again. De Queiroz attempts to unify\nthe species category by asserting that all and only lineages are\nspecies. But that just masks the heterogeneity of the species category\nbecause what constitutes a lineage has multiple answers, and those\nanswers vary according to which species concept one adopts.\n3.3 Recent Responses to Pluralism\n\nIn the last five years a new set of criticisms have been launched\nagainst species pluralism. Let\u2019s start with Barker\u2019s\n(2019a, 2019b) recent work. Barker (2019a) offers several arguments\nagainst species pluralism and he suggests a new form of species\nmonism. \n\nOne assumption that species pluralists make is that there are three\n(perhaps more) types of lineages that biologists call\n\u2018species\u2019. Hence when biologists refer with the word\n\u2018species\u2019 they refer to different types of lineages. As we\nsaw earlier, three types of species lineages are brought to the fore\nby three different species concepts: (1) The Biological Species\nConcept and related concepts highlight those lineages bound by the\nprocess of interbreeding. (2) The Phylogenetic Species Concepts\nhighlight those lineages of organisms that share a common and unique\nancestor. (3) The Ecological Species Concepts highlight lineages of\norganisms that are exposed to common sets of stabilizing selection.\nAccording to species pluralism, the Tree of Life is segmented by\ndifferent processes into different types of species lineages. Barker,\nhowever, questions the pluralist assumption that there are three\ndistinct types of lineages that fall under the heading\n\u2018species\u2019. Barker argues that pluralists have not\nsufficiently established the plausibility of that assumption. For\nexample, he argues that while pluralists assume that interbreeding and\necological species are different types of lineages, many interbreeding\nspecies and ecological species lack explanatorily or predictively\nsignificant differences. So, the pluralist\u2019s assumption that\nthere are distinct types of species lineages is problematic. \n\nBarker also attacks species pluralism from a different angle. In the\npluralist\u2019s argument there is the assumption that the three main\ntypes of species lineages are basal lineages. \u2018Basal\u2019 here\nmeans they are the smallest lineages on the Tree of Life that are\nrecognized by the Linnaean Hierarchy of biological classification.\n(Recall that hierarchy: species are the smallest units of\nclassification followed by more inclusive units such as genus, family,\norder, and so on.) Barker argues that species pluralists unknowingly\nmake an assumption that goes against their attempt to establish\nspecies pluralism. Namely, they assume the three types of species taxa\nthat pluralists refer to (interbreeding species lineages, ecological\nspecies lineages, and phylogenetic species lineages) have an important\nsimilarity \u2013 they are all basal lineages in the Linnaean Hierarchy. If\nthat is the case, then these different types of species lineages have\nsomething in common \u2013 they are all basal lineages. So, species\npluralists are wrong to assert that there are three types of species\nlineages that lack a biologically important commonality.\n\nBarker goes further and suggests what might unify the different\nlineages that fall under different species concepts. Baker argues that\nthe pluralists\u2019 focus on the different forces that cause species\nlineages (interbreeding, ecological, and phylogenetic) is the wrong\nplace to look for unity in the species category. Instead, he suggests\nwe should look for the common effect of species lineages. The common\neffect he focuses on is species cohesiveness. He suggests that species\nlineages are metapopulational feedback systems. Such systems\nhave cohesifying processes that cause further cohesifying processes.\nBarker cites the example of selection for a particular flower color in\na South American plant species. That color is very attractive to\npollinators, thus causing pollinators to more frequently visit that\nspecies\u2019 flowers. That, in turn, causes the genes of the plant\nto be more widely spread to other populations of that species. In this\nexample, selection causes the enhancement of another cohesifying\nforce, gene flow, among the members of a species. As Barker\nrecognizes, his suggestion concerning feedback and cohesiveness in\nspecies is a theoretical hypothesis that needs empirical confirmation.\nNevertheless, it provides a new way that species monists may secure\ntheir position.\n\nAnother recent response to species pluralism is found in the work of\nDoolittle (2019) and Novak and Doolittle (2021). They don\u2019t deny\nthe pluralism in species pluralism, but they deny the\nspecies in species pluralism. That is, they agree with\npluralists that there are different processes that cause the existence\nof basal taxa (what we usually call \u2018species\u2019).\nNevertheless, they think that the general concept of species does\nsignificant work in biology and should not be rejected. The importance\nof the general concept of species, they argue, is to organize the\nstudy of those evolutionary processes that cause basal taxa.\n\nHow does the concept of species help organize the study of evolution,\naccording to Novak and Doolittle? The general concept of species\nconsists of what they call \u201cconceptual patchworks.\u201d Those conceptual\npatchworks are the various species concepts we have seen, such as the\nBiological Species Concept and the Ecological Species Concept. These\npatchwork concepts interact and contribute to our understanding of\nspeciation. For instance, the Biological Species Concept was first\ndeveloped for multicellular organisms, but more recently ideas from\nthat concept have been applied to microorganisms. The result is a\npatchwork version of the Biological Species Concept that applies to\nmulticellular organisms and another version that applies to\nmicroorganisms. (See Section 4 of this entry for more on microbiology\nand species.)\n\nAnother way that Novak and Doolittle see individual species concepts\n(patchworks for them) working together is that they describe the\ndifferent processes that cause the existence of genetic and phenotypic\nclusters of organisms (in other words, basal taxa). For instance, the\nBiological Species Concept focuses on the exchange of genes among the\nmembers of a group, while the Ecological Species Concept focuses on\nthe how selection affects those organisms. According Novak and\nDoolittle, most microorganism clusters are the result of both\nprocesses to varying degrees. These are cases where the Biological\nSpecies Concept and the Ecological Species Concept work together in\nhelping us understand what causes those clusters.\n\nIn the end, Novak and Doolittle accept that there is a plurality of\nspecies concepts that highlight different processes that cause stable\nclusters of organisms. Despite this pluralism, they think the general\nconcept of species and the individual species concepts that fall under\nit form a set of conceptual tools that interact and allow us to\ninvestigate how evolutionary processes give rise to stable clusters of\norganisms. As a consequence, Novak and Doolittle reject the pluralist\nview that the concept of species fails to provide an overarching\nexplanatory approach in biology.\n4. Microbiology and Species\n\nMuch of the debate over species pluralism focuses on multicellular\norganisms. In other words, the debate focuses on how to sort mammals,\nbirds, fish, plants, and other multicellular organisms into species.\nHowever, most of life is not multicellular. Most organisms in the\nworld are single cell microbial organisms (Rossello-Mora and Amann\n2001). Just as biologists sort multicellular organisms into species,\nmicrobiologists sort microbial organisms into species. Advancements in\ngenetic technology in the last thirty years have caused an increase in\ntaxonomic work in microbiology, including ways to think about\nmicrobial species. Microbial biologists have their own species\nconcepts\u2014definitions of \u2018species\u2019 that apply to only\nmicrobial organisms. Microbial species concepts vary, and as we shall\nsee, cross-classify microbial organisms into different species. Once\nagain we come to the question of species pluralism.\n\nConsider some of the species concepts developed by microbiologists.\nOne microbial species concept, the Recombination Species Concept,\nasserts that species are groups of microbes whose genomes can\nrecombine (Dykuizen and Green 1991). The motivation behind this\nspecies concept is that though microbes generally do not reproduce\nsexually, they form gene pools of organisms connected by\nrecombination. Another microbial species concept is Cohan\u2019s\n(2001, 467) ecological concept in which a \u201cspecies in the\nbacterial world may be understood as an evolutionary lineage bound by\necotype-periodic selection.\u201d According to Nesbo et al. (2006)\nand others, these two microbial species concepts sometimes sort the\nsame organisms into different species. A third microbial species\nconcept, the Phylo-Phenetic Species Concept (Rossello-Mora and Amann\n2001), is different than the first two. While the Recombination and\nEcological Concepts are based on biological theory about the nature of\nmicrobial species, the Phylo-Phenetic Species Concept is designed to\nobtain stable classifications of species that can be used in medical\nand microbial research.\n\nYet another approach to microbial species uses genetic data to\ndetermine phylogenetic relations and assigns organisms to species\naccording to those relations. Microbiologists use various types of\ngenetic data for recognizing microbial species, such as 16S rRNA\ngenes, DNA:DNA hybridization, ANI or average nucleotide identity, and\ncore or house-keeping genes. Using such genetic data to classify\nmicrobes into species is complicated by the existence of lateral gene\ntransfer. Lateral gene transfer occurs when microbes share genetic\nmaterial with microbes near them. Lateral gene transfer is not the\ntransfer of genetic material due to reproduction, but a different way\nmicrobes share genes. Lateral gene transfer is frequent in microbes.\n(See O\u2019Malley 2014 for an explanation of lateral gene transfer.)\nGiven the frequent occurrence of lateral gene transfer among microbes,\ndifferent parts of a microbe\u2019s genome will have different\nevolutionary histories. Microbiologists use different genes when\nclassifying microbes into species. As a result, they obtain different\nclassifications of species.\n\nStepping back from these details, we see that depending on the\nmicrobial species concept or the type of genetic data used,\nmicrobiologists will obtain different species classifications for a\nparticular set of organisms. One might wonder if this situation gives\nus reason to be species pluralists when it comes to microbiology. Is\none microbial species concept, or one type of genetic data, better\nthan all the rest and we should adopt monism? Or is there no best way\nto sort microbes into species but a variety of equally adequate ways?\nIf the latter is correct then we should be pluralists concerning\nmicrobial species. For further discussion of microbiology and species,\nsee O\u2019Malley and Dupr\u00e9 2007, Franklin 2007, Morgan and\nPitts 2008, Doolittle and Bapteste 2007, Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva\n2009, Ereshefsky 2010b, and O\u2019Malley 2014.\n5. Does the Species Category Exist?\n\nThere is another aspect of species pluralism worth discussing. Suppose\none accepts species pluralism. The term \u2018species\u2019 then\nrefers to different types of lineages. Some species are groups of\ninterbreeding organisms, other species are groups of organisms that\nshare a common ecological niche, and still other species are\nphylogenetic units. Given that there are different types of species,\none might wonder what feature causes these different types of species\nto be species?\n\nPerhaps they share a common property that renders them species. If one\nadopts the thesis that all species are genealogical lineages, then a\ncommon feature of species is their being lineages. However, this\nfeature is also shared by other types of taxa in the Linnaean\nHierarchy. From an evolutionary perspective, all taxa, whether they be\nspecies, genera, or tribes, are genealogical lineages. We need to\nlocate a feature that is not only common in species but also\ndistinguishes species from other types of taxa.\n\nBiological taxonomists often talk in terms of the patterns and\nprocesses of evolution. Perhaps there is a process or a pattern that\noccurs in species but not in other types of taxa. Such a process or\npattern would unify the types of lineages we call\n\u2018species.\u2019 Let us start with process. The Biological\nSpecies Concept highlights those species bound by the process of\ninterbreeding. The Ecological Species Concept identifies those species\nunified by stabilizing selection. The species highlighted by\nPhylogenetic Species Concepts are unified by such historical processes\nas genetic and developmental homeostasis. A survey of these different\nspecies concepts reveals that species are bound by different types of\nprocesses. So no single type of process is common to all species.\nArguably, none of these processes are unique to species either\n(Mishler and Donoghue 1982).\n\nWhat about pattern? Do species display a pattern that distinguishes\nthem from other types of taxa? If by pattern we mean ontological\nstructure, then species have different patterns. Species are\nindividuals, but they are different types of individuals. Species of\nasexual organisms and species of sexual organisms have different\nstructures. Both types of species contain organisms that are\ngenealogically connected to a common ancestor. But the organisms in a\nsexual species are also connected by interbreeding. Thus species of\nsexual organisms form causally integrated entities: within a given\ngeneration, their members exchange genetic material through sexual\nreproduction. Species of asexual organisms do not form causally\nintegrated entities: their organisms are merely connected to a common\nancestor.\n\nThere are other suggestions for the common and unique pattern of\nspecies. Many observe that the organisms of a species often look the\nsame or that the organisms of a species share a cluster of reoccurring\nproperties. To the extent that this is true, it is also true of genera\nand some other higher taxa. The members of some genera tend to look\nthe same and have a cluster of stable properties. Another suggestion\nfor the pattern that distinguishes species is their ability to evolve\nas a unit\u2014species are the units of evolution, other types of\ntaxa are not. But again, many higher taxa have such unity as well\n(Mishler and Donoghue 1982).\n\nThe above survey of candidate unifying features is far from\nexhaustive. But the result is clear enough. Species vary in their\nunifying processes and ontological structure. Furthermore, many\nfeatures that biologists and philosophers highlight as unique to\nspecies occur in many higher taxa as well. Given this survey, what\nposition should we adopt concerning the nature of species? There are\nseveral options. According to one option we should keep looking for\nthe unifying feature of species. This is the option favored by some\nmonists (Sober 1984). Contemporary biology may not have discovered the\nunifying feature of species, but that does not mean that biology will\nnot find such a feature in the future. To give up the search for the\nunifying nature of species would be too hasty.\n\nAnother option starts with the assumption that the search for the\nunifying feature of species has gone on long enough. Biologists have\nlooked long and hard for the correct definition of\n\u2018species.\u2019 The result of that search is not that we do not\nknow what species are. The result is that the organic world contains\ndifferent types of species. The conclusion drawn by some pluralists\n(Kitcher 1984, Dupr\u00e9 1993) is that the term\n\u2018species\u2019 should be given a disjunctive definition.\nSpecies are either interbreeding lineages, or ecological lineages, or\nphylogenetic units, or \u2026.\n\nA third option, like the previous one, assumes that biologists have\nlooked long enough for the unifying feature of species. In that\nsearch, biology has learned that there are different types of lineages\ncalled \u2018species.\u2019 But proponents (Ereshefsky 1998) of this\noption do not opt for a disjunctive definition of\n\u2018species.\u2019 According to this option, we should doubt the\nvery existence of the category species. Those lineages we call\n\u2018species\u2019 vary in their patterns and processes.\nFurthermore, the distinction between species and other types of taxa\nis riddled with vagueness. Consequently, we should doubt whether the\nterm \u2018species\u2019 refers to a real category in nature.\n\nTo better understand this third option it is useful to see more\nprecisely what is being doubted. Biologists make a distinction between\nthe species category and species taxa. Species taxa\nare the individual lineages we call \u2018species.\u2019 Homo\nsapiens and Canis familiaris are species taxa. The\nspecies category is a more inclusive entity. The species category is\nthe class of all species taxa. The third option does not call into\nquestion the existence of Homo sapiens or Canis\nfamiliaris or any other lineage that we call\n\u2018species.\u2019 The third option just calls into question the\nexistence of the categorical rank of species. (For different\napproaches that call into question the existence of the species\ncategory, see Mishler and Wilkins 2018, and Haber 2019. For recent\ndefences of the reality of the species category see Currie 2016,\nBarker 2019a, Novak and Doolittle 2021.)\n6. Darwin and Species\n\nWhat did Darwin mean by the word \u2018species\u2019? Answers to\nthat question vary (see Ghiselin 1969, Mayr 1982, Beatty 1992, Stamos\n2007, Mallet 2008, Kohn 2008, Wilkins 2009, and Ereshefsky 2010c).\nNevertheless, it seems that Darwin was an anti-realist when it comes\nto the species category, though a realist concerning those taxa called\n\u2018species\u2019 by competent naturalists. Consider what he wrote\nto his friend, the botanist Joseph Hooker.\n\nIt is really laughable to see what different ideas are prominent in\nvarious naturalists\u2019 minds, when they speak of\n\u2018species\u2019; in some, resemblance is everything and descent\nof little weight\u2014in some, resemblance seems to go for nothing,\nand Creation the reigning idea\u2014in some, sterility an unfailing\ntest, with others it is not worth a farthing. It all comes, I believe,\nfrom trying to define the indefinable. (December 24, 1856; in F.\nDarwin 1887, vol. 2, 88)\n\n\nFor Darwin, the word \u2018species\u2019 is indefinable. One reason\nhe thought it was indefinable because he was skeptical of the\ndistinction between species and varieties. For example, in the\nOrigin of Species, he writes, \u201cI look at the term\nspecies as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set\nof individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not\nessentially differ from the term variety\u201d (1859 [1964], 52). In\nother words, \u2018species\u2019 is indefinable because there is no\ndifference between species and varieties. But why would Darwin think\nthere is no distinction between species and varieties? Darwin offers\nseveral reasons (Ereshefsky 2010c). First, Darwin argues that no\nprocess distinguishes varieties from species. Second, he contends that\nany differences drawn between them lie on a seamless continuum and are\ndrawn for pragmatic reasons. Third, Darwin rejects the distinction\nbetween varieties and species because it is built on ideas concerning\ncreation rather than natural selection. In what follows we will just\nlook at why Darwin thought there was no process difference between\nspecies and varieties.\n\nChapter 8 of the Origin of Species titled\n\u201cHybridism\u201d is devoted to discussing whether hybrid\nsterility serves as an adequate criterion for distinguishing species\nfrom varieties. Such naturalists as John Ray and Buffon held that\nhybrid sterility marked the species/variety boundary. They believed\nthat offspring from parents of different species are sterile, whereas\noffspring from parents of different varieties of the same species are\nfertile. Much of Darwin\u2019s chapter on hybridism is dedicated to\nproviding counterexamples to the claim that hybrid sterility marks a\ndistinction between species and varieties. In the end, Darwin rejects\nhybrid sterility as a criterion for distinguishing species and\nvarieties. He writes, \u201cIt can thus be shown that neither\nsterility nor fertility affords a clear distinction between species\nand varieties\u201d (1859 [1964], 248).\n\nFurther evidence that Darwin doubted a process distinction between\nspecies and varieties is found in Chapter 4 of the Origin of\nSpecies, titled \u201cNatural Selection.\u201d Darwin proposes\ntwo principles, which he calls The Principle of Character Divergence\nand The Principle of Extinction. Together these principles explain the\norigin of new taxa and morphological gaps among taxa. The Principle of\nCharacter Divergence has a familiar Darwinian starting point. Suppose\nthat a geographic region contains several closely related groups of\norganisms. Within one of those groups, some organisms are selected\nbecause they have a trait that gives them an adaptive advantage.\nDivergent selection occurs in future generations when organisms with\neven better adapted forms of that trait are selected, eventually\ncausing pronounced morphological gaps between that group of organisms\nand its parent and sister groups (Darwin 1859 [1964], 112ff.). Darwin\nillustrates this process with a number of examples. Consider his\nexample of a pigeon fancier (1859 [1964],112). A pigeon fancier is\nstruck by the slightly longer beak of some birds. She then selects\nbirds with slightly longer beaks in that generation, and continues to\ndo so in subsequent generations until there is a pronounced\nmorphological gap between the selected group and the original stock.\nDarwin argues that the process of divergent selection causes the\norigin of new taxa and is the source of branching on the tree of\nlife.\n\nThe Principle of Extinction further explains the gaps we find in\nbiodiversity. As groups become more distinctive and better adapted to\ntheir environment, their parental and sister groups are pushed to\nextinction. This extinction of \u201cintermediates,\u201d as Darwin\ncalls them, causes the observed gaps among taxa (1859 [1964],121ff.).\nExtinction, in other words, prunes branches on tree of life so that it\nhas the shape we observe. Together, the Principles of Character\nDivergence and Extinction explain the origin of varieties and species,\nand the observed patterns of biodiversity in the world. The relevant\npoint for our discussion of Darwin is that there is no special\nspeciation mechanism that marks the difference between species and\nvarieties. As Kohn (2008) notes, Darwin did not use the word\n\u2018speciation\u2019 in the Origin. For Darwin, the\norigin of varieties and species is due to divergent selection. As\nDarwin writes: \u201cThe origin of the existence of groups\nsubordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species,\nnamely, closeness of descent with various degrees of\nmodification\u201d (1859 [1964], 423).\n\nThus far it has been suggested that Darwin doubted the existence of\nthe species category because he doubted the distinction between\nspecies and varieties. What about those taxa called\n\u2018species\u2019 by competent naturalists, are they real taxa for\nDarwin? It seems that Darwin was a realist when it comes to taxa. A\npassage at the start of the Origin\u2019s chapter on\nclassification, Chapter 13, confirms this. Darwin writes that\n\u201c[f]rom the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to\nresemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed\nin groups under groups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary\nlike the grouping of the stars in constellations\u201d (1859 [1964],\n411). Those taxa (\u201cgroups\u201d) identified by competent\nnaturalists can be real. And classifications of groups within groups,\nif properly constructed, reflect the hierarchical arrangement of taxa\nin the world. Thus, Darwin\u2019s skepticism of the species category\ndid not extend to taxa and those taxa called\n\u2018species.\u2019\n7. Values and Species\n\nThere is another topic concerning species that has recently been\ndiscussed in the philosophical and biological literature. This topic\nconcerns the reasons biologists have for accepting or rejecting a\nspecies concept. Typically, biologists use such standard epistemic\nvalues as empirical accuracy or generality for accepting or rejecting a\nspecies concept. For instance, supporters of the Ecological Species\nConcept believe their concept is better than the Biological Species\nConcept because the Ecological Species Concept is more general \u2013 it\napplies to both sexual and asexual organisms whereas the Biological\nSpecies Concept only applies to sexual organisms (see Ereshefsky 2001\nfor discussion). Recently, some biologists have offered non-epistemic\nreasons (such as moral or social reasons) for accepting or rejecting a\nspecies concept (Frankham et al. 2012, Zachos et al. 2013, and\nAttenborough 2015). Before talking about how some biologists use\nnon-epistemic reasons for choosing species concepts, let\u2019s have\na brief introduction to the issue of science and values in the\nphilosophy of science.\n\nA standard view in philosophy of science for much of the 20th Century\nwas that scientists should use only epistemic values in evaluating\nhypotheses (Reiss and Springer 2017). Non-epistemic values, such as\nmoral or social values, should not be used in judging scientific\nhypotheses. This view is called the \u2018Value Free Ideal\u2019\n(see Section 3 of the entry \n scientific objectivity). The word \u2018ideal\u2019 is used to recognize that some\nnon-epistemic values do affect the selection of scientific hypotheses\n(for example, through implicit bias), but scientists should strive as\nbest they can to avoid using non-epistemic values when selecting\nhypotheses. Recently, a number of philosophers have argued that the\nValue Free Ideal cannot be achieved, and moreover we should not\nattempt to rid science of non-epistemic values (for example, Kourany\n2010, Kitcher 2011). Instead of discussing the general issue of\nscience and values further, let\u2019s see how these issues arise\nwhen it comes to species. \n\nA survey of the sorts of values biologists used in the second half of\nthe 20th Century for accepting or rejecting species concepts shows that\nbiologists typically used epistemic values. Many biologists wanted\nspecies concepts that helped biologists make inferences about the\nmembers of particular species (for example, Mayr 1982 and Eldridge and\nCracraft 1980). That is, species concepts should pick out those\nspecies taxa such that if we know that an organism belongs to a\nparticular species, we can infer that this organism probably has a\nparticular property. To put it another way, species concepts should\nidentify species that allow us to make projective inferences. Other\nepistemic values that biologists want species concepts to have include\nsimplicity, generality, and uniformity (see Ereshefsky 2001 for\nfurther discussion).\n\nMore recently, some biologists have argued that not only should\nspecies concepts be evaluated on how well they achieve particular\nepistemic aims, but also how well they satisfy certain non-epistemic\nvalues (Ludwig 2016, Conix 2019, Reydon and Ereshefsky 2022). For\nexample, some biologists believe that if we want to preserve species\nfrom extinction, we are better off using the Biological Species\nConcept rather than Phylogentic Species Concepts (Frankham et al. 2012\nand Zachos et al. 2013). (These species concepts were introduced and\nexplained in Section 3 above.) These biologists reason as follows.\nPhylogenetic Species Concepts identify considerably more species taxa\nthan the Biological Species Concept. Yet there is limited funding and\nresources for preserving species. If the Phylogenetic Species Concept\nis adopted, then funding and resources for preserving species will be\nspread too thinly. Moreover, the Phylogenetic Species Concepts tend to\nidentify more species with small populations. Those small species are\nless likely to survive than the larger species identified by the\nBiological Species Concept. Thus, these biologists are using the value\nof preserving biodiversity (which is a non-epistemic value) to choose\nwhich species concept to accept. \n\nAnother example of a biologist using social values to accept or reject\na species concept is Attenborough\u2019s (2015) preference for\nemploying the Phylogenetic Species Concept over the Biological Species\nConcept when trying to eradicate malaria. Attenborough argues that\nPhylogenetic Species Concepts performs better than the Biological\nSpecies Concept at identifying cryptic and incipient mosquito species.\nIdentifying such cryptic groups is important for public health\npurposes, because such groups, and not others, can be the bearers of\nmalaria parasites. Here, then, is an example where a biologist is\nchoosing one species concept over another because one concept better\npromotes the non-epistemic aim of eradicating malaria and promoting\nhuman health. \n\nThese examples show there is yet another issue in the debate over\nspecies that requires philosophical attention. Recently, the choice of\na species concept in some cases turns on non-epistemic values, that\nis, moral or social values. This is a departure from the view that\nonly epistemic or metaphysical concerns should affect the choice of\nspecies concepts. If moral and social considerations should be taken\ninto account when selecting species concepts, there are philosophical\nquestions to consider. For example, one might wonder when it is\nlegitimate to use a non-epistemic value in accessing a species concept?\nOr one might wonder what should be done if conflicting but legitimate\nnon-epistemic values favor different species concepts? As this section\ndemonstrates, philosophical questions concerning species are not\nlimited to epistemic or metaphysical questions. The concept of species\nis also entangled with moral and social issues.\n8. Summary\n\nThis encyclopedia entry started with the observation that at an\nintuitive level the nature of species seems fairly obvious. But a\nreview of the biological and philosophical literature reveals that our\nunderstanding of species is far from settled. The debate over the\nnature of species involves a number of issues. One issue is their\nontological status: are species natural kinds or individuals? A second\nissue concerns pluralism: should we adopt species monism or species\npluralism? A third issue is whether the term \u2018species\u2019\nrefers to a real category in nature. Even Darwin, it seems, doubted\nthat \u2018species\u2019 refers to a real category in nature.\nFinally we looked at how social values may affect which definitions of\n\u2018species\u2019 biologists use. Throughout this entry we have\nseen that many questions concerning biological species are in part\nphilosophical. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Attenborough, R., 2015, \u201cWhat are species and why does it\nmatter?
