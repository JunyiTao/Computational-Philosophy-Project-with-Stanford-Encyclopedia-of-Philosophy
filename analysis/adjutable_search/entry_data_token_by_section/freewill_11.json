    "main_text": "Theological Wrinkles || Free Will and God\u2019s Power, Knowledge, and Goodness\n4.2 God\u2019s Freedom\n\nFinally, there is the question of the freedom of God himself. Perfect\ngoodness is an essential, not acquired, attribute of God. God cannot\nlie or be in any way immoral in His dealings with His creatures\n(appearances notwithstanding). Unless we take the minority position on\nwhich this is a trivial claim, since whatever God does\ndefinitionally counts as good, this appears to be a\nsignificant, inner constraint on God\u2019s freedom. Did we not\ncontemplate immediately above that human freedom would be curtailed by\nour having an unmistakable awareness of what is in fact the Good? And\nyet is it not passing strange to suppose that God should be less than\nperfectly free?\n\nOne suggested solution to this puzzle takes as its point of departure\nthe distinction noted in section 2.3 between the ability to do\notherwise and sourcehood, proposing that the core metaphysical feature\nof freedom is being the ultimate source, or originator, of one\u2019s\nchoices. For human beings or any created persons who owe their\nexistence to factors outside themselves, the only way their acts of\nwill could find their ultimate origin in themselves is for such acts\nnot to be determined by their character and circumstances. For if all\nmy willings were wholly determined, then if we were to trace my causal\nhistory back far enough, we would ultimately arrive at external\nfactors that gave rise to me, with my particular genetic dispositions.\nMy motives at the time would not be the ultimate source of my\nwillings, only the most proximate ones. Only by there being\nless than deterministic connections between external influences and\nchoices, then, is it be possible for me to be an ultimate source of my\nactivity, concerning which I may truly say, \u201cthe buck stops\nhere.\u201d\n\nAs is generally the case, things are different on this point in the\ncase of God. As Anselm observed, even if God\u2019s character\nabsolutely precludes His performing certain actions in certain\ncontexts, this will not imply that some external factor is in any way\na partial origin of His willings and refrainings from willing. Indeed,\nthis would not be so even if he were determined by character to will\neverything which He wills. God\u2019s nature owes its\nexistence to nothing. Thus, God would be the sole and ultimate source\nof His will even if He couldn\u2019t will otherwise.\n\nWell, then, might God have willed otherwise in any respect?\nThe majority view in the history of philosophical theology is that He\nindeed could have. He might have chosen not to create anything at all.\nAnd given that He did create, He might have created any number of\nalternatives to what we observe. But there have been noteworthy\nthinkers who argued the contrary position, along with others who\nclearly felt the pull of the contrary position even while resisting\nit. The most famous such thinker is Leibniz (1710 [1985]), who argued\nthat God, being both perfectly good and perfectly powerful, cannot\nfail to will the best possible world. Leibniz insisted that this is\nconsistent with saying that God is able to will otherwise, although\nhis defense of this last claim is notoriously difficult to make out\nsatisfactorily. Many read Leibniz, malgr\u00e9 lui, as one\nwhose basic commitments imply that God could not have willed other\nthan He does in any respect.\n\nOne might challenge Leibniz\u2019s reasoning on this point by\nquestioning the assumption that there is a uniquely best possible\nCreation (an option noted by Adams 1987, though he challenges instead\nLeibniz\u2019s conclusion based on it). One way this could be is if\nthere is no well-ordering of worlds: some pairs of worlds are\nsufficiently different in kind that they are incommensurate with each\nother (neither is better than the other, nor are they equal) and no\nworld is better than either of them. Another way this could be is if\nthere is no upper limit on goodness of worlds: for every possible\nworld God might have created, there are others (infinitely many, in\nfact) which are better. If such is the case, one might argue, it is\nreasonable for God to arbitrarily choose which world to create from\namong those worlds exceeding some threshold value of overall\ngoodness.\n\nHowever, William Rowe (2004) has countered that the thesis that there\nis no upper limit on goodness of worlds has a very different\nconsequence: it shows that there could not be a morally perfect\nCreator! For suppose our world has an on-balance moral value of \\(n\\)\nand that God chose to create it despite being aware of possibilities\nhaving values higher than \\(n\\) that He was able to create. It seems\nwe can now imagine a morally better Creator: one having the same\noptions who chooses to create a better world. For critical replies to\nRowe, see Almeida (2008, ch. 1), Kray (2010), and Zimmerman (2018).\n\nFinally, Norman Kretzmann (1997, 220\u201325) has argued in the\ncontext of Aquinas\u2019s theological system that there is strong\npressure to say that God must have created something or other, though\nit may well have been open to Him to create any of a number of\ncontingent orders. The reason is that there is no plausible account of\nhow an absolutely perfect God might have a resistible\nmotivation\u2014one consideration among other, competing\nconsiderations\u2014for creating something rather than nothing. (It\nobviously cannot have to do with any sort of utility, for example.)\nThe best general understanding of God\u2019s being motivated to\ncreate at all\u2014one which in places Aquinas himself comes very\nclose to endorsing\u2014is to see it as reflecting the fact that\nGod\u2019s very being, which is goodness, necessarily diffuses\nitself. Perfect goodness will naturally communicate itself outwardly;\nGod who is perfect goodness will naturally create, generating a\ndependent reality that imperfectly reflects that goodness. Wainwright\n(1996) discusses a somewhat similar line of thought in the Puritan\nthinker Jonathan Edwards. Alexander Pruss (2016), however, raises\nsubstantial grounds for doubt concerning this line of thought;\nO\u2019Connor (2022) offers a rejoinder. \n",
