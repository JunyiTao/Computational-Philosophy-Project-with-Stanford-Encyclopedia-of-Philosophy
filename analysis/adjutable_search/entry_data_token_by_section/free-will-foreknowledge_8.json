Incompatibilist responses to the argument for theological fatalism\n\nEver since the dilemma of this article was identified, there have been\nphilosophers who thought that something like our basic argument\nsucceeds in demonstrating that infallible foreknowledge is\nincompatible with human free will. If they are incompatible, one of\nthem must be given up. It\u2019s possible to give up both, of course,\nbut that\u2019s more than the argument requires, and one reason the\ndilemma has attracted so much attention in the history of philosophy\nis that both the belief in a being with infallible foreknowledge and\nbelief in the existence of libertarian free will are strongly\nentrenched in the world view of many philosophers. To give up either\nof these beliefs is difficult and often has many ramifications for\none\u2019s other beliefs.\n\nThe denial of libertarian freedom has always had many supporters. The\nidea of making causal determinism the focal point of discussions of\nfree will is modern in origin, and some philosophers think that the\nmodern framing of the issue is confused. Philosophers who deny\nlibertarian freedom may affirm a type of free will compatible with\ndeterminism, or they may instead simply accept the consequence that\nhuman beings lack free will. It is worth noting, however, that theists\nwho deny libertarian freedom are typically theological\ndeterminists rather than fatalists; it\u2019s\nprimarily considerations of divine omnipotence or sovereignty, rather\nthan foreknowledge, that motivate them. When Augustine, for example,\nrejected human freedom apart from divine control\u2014\u201cI tried\nhard to maintain the free decision of the human will, but the grace of\nGod was victorious\u201d (Retractationes 2.1)\u2014it\nwasn\u2019t because of the fatalist argument from divine\nforeknowedge, which (as we\u2019ve seen) he regarded as a complete\nfailure. Jonathan Edwards, on the other hand, based his Calvinist\ndenial of libertarian freedom, in part, on a sophisticated version of\nthe argument for theological fatalism (FW II.12).\n\nThe other incompatibilist position is to affirm libertarian free will\nalong with the principle of alternate possibilities (premise 9), and\nto deny the possibility of infallible foreknowledge. This position has\nrecently come into prominence through its association with \u201copen\ntheism\u201d (Pinnock et al. 1994). Open theists reject\ndivine timelessness and immutability, along with infallible\nforeknowledge, arguing that not only should foreknowledge be rejected\nbecause of its fatalist consequences, but the view of a God who takes\nrisks, and can be surprised and even disappointed at how things turn\nout, is more faithful to Scripture than the classical notion of an\nessentially omniscient and foreknowing deity (Sanders 1998, Boyd\net al 2001, 13\u201347). See Rhoda et al\n(2006) for an argument that the key issue in the open theism debate is\nthe nature of the future, and Tuggy (2007) for an overview of the\ndifferent positions open theists can take on this question. A reply to\nboth Rhoda et al. and Tuggy may be found in Craig and Hunt\n(2013). Fischer, Todd and Tognazzini (2009) offers a wide-ranging\nappraisal of responses to Pike's argument, paying special\nattention to open theism and issues in the philosophy of time. For an\nargument that open theism necessitates the view that propositions\nabout the future lack truth value, see Arbour (2013). Todd disagrees\non behalf of the open theist, defending (but without endorsing) the\nmutability of the future (2016a), and arguing that future contingents\nare all false rather than truth-valueless (2016b). Boyd (2015)\nattempts to turn the tables against critics on the grounds that the\nopenist God\u2019s knowledge of all the ways the future\nmight go represents more knowledge than the\nclassical theistic God\u2019s knowledge of the way the future\nwill go. Arbour (2019) is a recent collection of commisioned\nessays criticizing open theism on philosophical grounds.\n\nOne influential argument that open theists use against defenders of\nforeknowledge who do not also accept Molinism is that foreknowledge\nwithout middle knowledge is useless for divine providence. In a number\nof papers (1993, 1997, 2009), David Hunt has defended the providential\nutility of foreknowledge without middle knowledge, describing cases in\nwhich foreknowledge enhances God\u2019s providential prospects\nwithout generating the \u201cmetaphysical problem\u201d of\nexplanatory circles, and arguing that the \u201cdoxastic\nproblem\u201d of agential impotence when one already knows what one\nis going to do rests on a principle that is in fact false. Responses\nto Hunt include Kapitan (1993), Basinger (1993), Robinson (2004a,\n2004b), and Hasker (2009). Zimmerman (2012) is friendlier to\nHunt\u2019s position.\n\nA related objection to foreknowledge without middle knowledge is that\nprophecy requires middle knowledge. See Pruss (2007) for a defense of\na foreknowledge-only account of prophecy. Another issue related to\ndivine providence is the efficacy of past-directed prayers. Kevin\nTimpe (2005) argues that adherents of simple foreknowledge or timeless\nknowledge and Molinists have the resources to explain the efficacy of\nprayers about the past, but open theism does not.\n",
