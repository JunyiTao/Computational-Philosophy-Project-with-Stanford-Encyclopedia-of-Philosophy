    "main_text": "Virtues || \u201cVirtue ethics\u201d\n4.5 \u201cVirtue ethics\u201d\n\nIn recent decades various philosophers and theologians have proposed\nthat ethics done well is virtue ethics, not an ethics of rules and\nprinciples. An ethics of the latter kind is denounced as legalistic.\nAs should be clear from the foregoing, Aquinas rejects the proposed\ncontrast and gives systematic prominence both to standards, such as\nprinciples and rules, and to virtues. He holds, in effect, that they\nare interdefined. Nor does he have any time for the view that there\nare no exceptionless moral norms and that moral norms or other\nstandards are no more than a kind of anticipation, shadow or\napproximation of the judgments which in each situation need to be made\nby a person of virtue, and which could never exclude in\nadvance any kind of act as always wrongful by reason of its\nobject and regardless of its further intentions or the circumstances\nof the situation. On the contrary, he holds that no human act is\nmorally good (right, in the sense of not wrong) unless it is in line\nwith love of self and neighbor (and thus with respect for the basic\naspects of the wellbeing of each and all human beings) not only (i) in\nthe motives or intentions with which it is chosen, and (ii) in the\nappropriateness of the circumstances, but also (iii) in its object\n(more precisely the object, or closest-in intention of the choosing\nperson) (see 2.1.1 above). This is the primary sense of the axiom he\nfrequently articulates by quoting an old tag: bonum ex integra\ncausa, malum ex quocumque defectu (good from an unflawed set of\ncontributing factors, bad from any defect in the set). That is, there\nis a fundamental asymmetry between moral good and moral evil \u2013 a\nnotion very foreign to any version of utilitarian or post-utilitarian\nconsequentialist or \u201cproportionalist\u201d ethics.\n",
