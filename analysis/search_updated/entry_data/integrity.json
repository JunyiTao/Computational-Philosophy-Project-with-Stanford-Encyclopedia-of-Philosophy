    "preamble": "\n\nIntegrity is one of the most important and oft-cited of virtue terms.\nIt is also perhaps the most puzzling. For example, while it is\nsometimes used virtually synonymously with \u2018moral,\u2019 we\nalso at times distinguish acting morally from acting with integrity.\nPersons of integrity may in fact act immorally\u2014though they would\nusually not know they are acting immorally. Thus one may acknowledge a\nperson to have integrity even though that person may hold what one\nthinks are importantly mistaken moral views.\n\nWhen used as a virtue term, \u2018integrity\u2019 refers to a\nquality of a person\u2019s character; however, there are other uses\nof the term. One may speak of the integrity of a wilderness region or\nan ecosystem, a computerized database, a defense system, a work of\nart, and so on. When it is applied to objects, integrity refers to the\nwholeness, intactness or purity of a thing\u2014meanings that are\nsometimes carried over when it is applied to people. A wilderness\nregion has integrity when it has not been corrupted by development or\nby the side-effects of development, when it remains intact as\nwilderness. A database maintains its integrity as long as it remains\nuncorrupted by error; a defense system as long as it is not breached.\nA musical work might be said to have integrity when its musical\nstructure has a certain completeness that is not intruded upon by\nuncoordinated, unrelated musical ideas; that is, when it possesses a\nkind of musical wholeness, intactness and purity.\n\nIntegrity is also attributed to various parts or aspects of a\nperson\u2019s life. We speak of attributes such as professional,\nintellectual and artistic integrity. However, the most philosophically\nimportant sense of the term \u2018integrity\u2019 relates to general\ncharacter. Philosophers have been particularly concerned to understand\nwhat it is for a person to exhibit integrity throughout life. What is\nit to be a person of integrity? Ordinary discourse about\nintegrity involves two fundamental intuitions: first, that integrity\nis primarily a formal relation one has to oneself, or between parts or\naspects of one\u2019s self; and second, that integrity is connected\nin an important way to acting morally, in other words, there are some\nsubstantive or normative constraints on what it is to act with\nintegrity.\n\nHow these two intuitions can be incorporated into a consistent theory\nof integrity is not obvious, and most accounts of integrity tend to\nfocus on one of these intuitions to the detriment of the other. A\nnumber of accounts have been advanced, the most important of them\nbeing: (i) integrity as the integration of self; (ii) integrity as\nmaintenance of identity; (iii) integrity as standing for something;\n(iv) integrity as moral purpose; and (v) integrity as a virtue. These\naccounts are reviewed below. We then examine several issues that have\nbeen of central concern to philosophers exploring the concept of\nintegrity: the relations between types of integrity, integrity and\nmoral theory, and integrity and social and political conditions.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Integrity as Self-Integration\n\nOn the self-integration view of integrity, integrity is a matter of\npersons integrating various parts of their personality into a\nharmonious, intact whole. Understood in this way, the integrity of\npersons is analogous to the integrity of things: integrity is\nprimarily a matter of keeping the self intact and uncorrupted. The\nself-integration view of integrity makes integrity a formal relation\nto the self.\n\nWhat is a formal relation to the self? One answer is that a formal\nrelation can be attributed to a person without evaluating the\nrelation\u2019s components. Strength of will is probably a formal\nrelation one has to oneself. Very roughly, we might say that a display\nof strength of will is a particular relation between a person\u2019s\nintention and corresponding action: it is a matter of acting on an\nintention given serious obstacles to the action. This is a formal\nrelation to the self in the sense we are after because we don\u2019t\nneed to evaluate the appropriateness, value, justice, practical\nwisdom, and so on, either of the intention or corresponding action in\norder to identify the whole thing as a case of strength of will. We\nmight think that all displays of strength of will are valuable, so we\nmight have certain pro-attitudes to an action simply because it is an\nattempt to fulfill an intention in the face of serious obstacles. Yet\nwe don\u2019t need to make this evaluation in order to attribute a\ndisplay of strength of will to someone. All we need to do is inspect\nthe correspondence of intention and action given the difficulty of\nacting on the intention. We don\u2019t need to evaluate whether the\nintention is directed at anything worthwhile, for example. John\nBigelow and Robert Pargetter (2007) argue that strength of will is the\ncore of integrity (and that alternative conceptions of integrity tend\nto confuse integrity with authenticity). The self-integration account\nof integrity takes this formal characterization of integrity a step\nfurther. Self-integration is an achievement rather than a quality or\ndisposition such as strength of will \u2014 though strength of will\nis likely to be an important quality in those who achieve\nself-integration. Self-integration still represents a formal account\nof integrity. In attributing self-integration to a person we are\nmaking no evaluative judgement of the states that are integrated\nwithin the person.\n\nOne instructive attempt to describe the fully integrated self is Harry\nFrankfurt\u2019s (Frankfurt 1987, 33\u201334). Frankfurt does not\nexplicitly address himself to the problem of defining integrity,\nnonetheless he does describe an important and influential account of\nself-integration. According to Frankfurt, desires and volitions (acts\nof will) are arranged in a hierarchy. First-order desires are desires\nfor various goods; second-order desires are desires that one desire\ncertain goods, or that one act on one first-order desire rather than\nanother. Similarly, one may will a particular action (first-order\nvolition) or one may will that one\u2019s first order volitions are\nof a particular sort (second-order volition). Second-order desires and\nvolitions pave the way for third-order desires and volitions, and so\non. According to Frankfurt, wholly integrated persons bring these\nvarious levels of volition and desire into harmony and fully identify\nwith them at the highest level. There are various ideas as to what it\nmeans to fully identify with higher-level desires and volitions.\nHowever, such identification appears to involve knowing them; not\ndeceiving oneself about them; and acting on them (usually).\n\nA person is subject to many conflicting desires. If one simply acted\nat each moment out of the strongest current desire, with no\ndeliberation or discrimination between more or less worthwhile\ndesires, then one clearly acts without integrity. Frankfurt calls such\na person a \u2018wanton\u2019 (Frankfurt 1971). Integrity thus\nrequires that one discriminate between first-order desires. One may do\nthis by endorsing certain first-order desires and\n\u2018outlawing\u2019 others. For instance, one may endorse a desire\nto study and \u2018outlaw\u2019 a desire to party, and do so by\nreference to a higher order desire ranking success over fun.\nSecond-order desires may conflict. One may value success over fun, but\nalso both fear that a ruthless pursuit of success will make one boring\nand value being fun over being boring. Fully integrated persons will\nnot fall victim to such conflict; they will either avoid it altogether\n(if they can) or resolve the conflict in some way. Resolution of\nself-conflict may be achieved by appeal to yet higher level desires or\nvolitions, or by deciding to endorse one set of desires and outlawing\nothers. At some point the full integration of one\u2019s self will\nrequire that one decide upon a certain structure of higher level\ndesires and order one\u2019s lower level desires and volitions in\nlight of it. As Frankfurt puts it, when a person unreservedly decides\nto endorse a particular desire:\n\n\u2026 the person no longer holds himself at all apart from the desire to\nwhich he has committed himself. It is no longer unsettled or uncertain\nwhether the object of that desire\u2014that is, what he\nwants\u2014is what he really wants: The decision determines what the\nperson really wants by making the desires upon which he decides fully\nhis own. To this extent the person, in making a decision by which he\nidentifies with a desire, constitutes himself. (Frankfurt\n1987, 38)\n\n\nWhen agents thus constitute themselves without ambivalence (that is,\nunresolved desire for a thing and against it) or inconsistency (that\nis, unresolved desire for incompatible things), then the agent has\nwhat Frankfurt calls wholeheartedness. On one way of developing the\nintegrated-self view of integrity, wholeheartedness is equated with\nintegrity. It should be noted that self-conflict is not limited to\ndesire. Conflict also ranges over commitments, principles, values, and\nwishes. Furthermore, all of these things\u2014desires, commitments,\nvalues, and so on\u2014are in flux. They change over time so that\nachieving the kind of \u2018wholeheartedness\u2019 that Frankfurt\ndescribes is a never-ending process and task. Self-knowledge is\ncrucial to this process in so far as one must know what one\u2019s\nvalues, for example, are if one is to order them.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s account illustrates one way of describing the\nfully-integrated self. (See Taylor 1981 for a different approach.) The\nkey question, however, is whether the idea of a fully-integrated self\nadequately captures the quality we ascribe when we say of someone that\nthey are a person of integrity. There have been a number of criticisms\nof the integrated-self view of integrity. First, it places only formal\nlimits on the kind of person who may be said to have integrity. People\nof integrity, however, are plausibly thought to be generally honest\nand genuine in their dealings with others. (See Halfon 1989,\n7\u20138.) Imagine a person who sells used-cars for a living and is\nwholeheartedly dedicated to selling cars for as much money as\npossible. Such a person will be prepared to blatantly lie in order to\nset up a deal. The person may well be perfectly integrated in\nFrankfurt\u2019s sense, but we should feel no temptation at all to\ndescribe them as having exemplary integrity.\n\nSecond, a person of integrity is plausibly said to make reasonable\njudgments about the relative importance of various desires and\ncommitments. Yet, again, the self-integration view places only formal\nlimits on the kind of desires that constitute a self. (See McFall\n1987, 9\u201311, Calhoun 1995, 237\u201338). As McFall notes, one\ncannot say with a straight face something like: \u2018Harold\ndemonstrates great integrity in his single-minded pursuit of\napproval.\u2019 (McFall 1987, 9; we discuss McFall\u2019s views more\nfully in Section 4, below.) If integrity is nothing more than the\nperfect integration of self, however, it is hard to see how one can\nautomatically deny Harold\u2019s integrity.\n\nThird, on some accounts, the fully and perfectly integrated person is\nnot able to experience genuine temptation. Temptation requires that\nthe full force of an \u2018outlaw\u2019 desire be experienced, but\nsuccessful integration of the self may mean that such desires are\nfully subordinated to wholeheartedly endorsed desires and this may\npreclude an agent fully experiencing them. (See Taylor 1981, 151 for\nan example of a view like this.) That a person experiences, and\novercomes, temptation would count against their integrity on such a\nview. One might think, however, that a capacity to overcome temptation\nand display strength of character is in fact a sign of a\nperson\u2019s integrity, not its lack. (Halfon 1989, 44\u20137 urges\nthis criticism.)\n\nFourth, Cheshire Calhoun argues that agents may find themselves in\nsituations in which wholeheartedness tends to undermine their\nintegrity rather than constitute it (Calhoun 1995, 238\u201341; see\nalso, Cox, La Caze and Levine 2003, 18\u20132.) Victoria Davion\n(1991) argues that a person may change radically and yet maintain\nintegrity. In the midst of a complex and multifaceted life one may\nhave compelling reasons to avoid neatly resolving incompatible\ndesires. The cost of the resolution of all self-conflict may be a\nwithdrawal from aspects of life that make genuine claims upon us.\nResolving self-conflict at the expense of fully engaging with\ndifferent parts of one\u2019s life does not seem to contribute to\none\u2019s integrity. It seems rather like the sort of cop-out that\nundermines integrity. (One should not confuse integrity with\nneatness.)\n\nChristian Golden (2019, 505) goes further in seeking to avoid\n\u2018framing ambivalence and conflict as defects of character and\naction\u2019, proposing humility as an alternative ideal to\nwholeheartedness as a model of personal integrity.\n\nOne possibility here is to acknowledge different kinds of integrity.\nFor example, Matthew Pianalto (2012) distinguishes between\npsychological integrity (a form of self-integration) and practical\nintegrity in order to deal with the integrity of agents for whom\nwholeheartedness is not a realistic option. Alfred Archer (2017, 435,\n453) argues that an integrated self has value whether or not we equate\nit with the virtue of integrity. Its principle value resides in the\neffect it has on moral agency. Self-integrated people tend\noverwhelmingly to be better, more effective moral agents than people\nwho are not integrated. Disintegration tends to undermine agency in\ngeneral, but most importantly, it tends to undermine moral agency.\nMoral exemplars exhibit strong traits of self-integration. The\nimportance and value of self-integration need not be identified with\nthe importance of integrity. They may have different foundations.\n2. The Identity View of Integrity\n\nA related approach to integrity is to think of it primarily in terms\nof a person\u2019s holding steadfastly true to their commitments,\nrather than ordering and endorsing desires. \u2018Commitment\u2019\nis used as a broad umbrella term covering many different kinds of\nintentions, promises, convictions and relationships of trust and\nexpectation. One may be, and usually is, committed in many different\nways to many different kinds of thing: people, institutions,\ntraditions, causes, ideals, principles, projects, and so on.\nCommitments can be explicitly, self-consciously, publicly entered into\nor implicit, unself-conscious and private. Some are relatively\nsuperficial and unimportant, like casual support of a sporting team;\nothers are very deep, like the commitment implicit in genuine love or\nfriendship.\n\nBecause we find ourselves with so many commitments, of so many\ndifferent kinds, and because commitments inevitably clash and change\nover time, it will not do to define integrity merely in terms of\nremaining steadfastly true to one\u2019s commitments. It matters\nwhich commitments we expect a person of integrity to remain true to.\nPhilosophers have developed different accounts of integrity in\nresponse to this need to specify the kind of commitments that are\ncentrally important to a person\u2019s integrity.\n\nOne option here is to define integrity in terms of the commitments\nthat people identify with most deeply, as constituting what they\nconsider their life is fundamentally about. Commitments of this kind\nare called \u2018identity-conferring commitments\u2019 or sometimes\n\u2018ground projects\u2019. This view of integrity, the identity\nview, is associated most closely with Bernard Williams. It is implicit\nin his discussion of integrity and utilitarianism (Williams 1973; we\nexamine this discussion below) and also features in his criticism of\nKantian moral theory (1981b). The idea is that for people to abandon\nan identity-conferring commitment is for them to lose grip on what\ngives their life its identity, or individual character. An\nidentity-conferring commitment, according to Williams, is \u2018the\ncondition of my existence, in the sense that unless I am propelled\nforward by the conatus of desire, project and interest, it is unclear\nwhy I should go on at all.\u2019 (Williams 1981b, 12).\n\nOne apparent consequence of defining integrity as maintenance of\nidentity-conferring commitments is that integrity cannot really be a\nvirtue. This is Williams\u2019s view. He argues that integrity is not\nrelated to motivation as virtues are. A virtue either motivates a\nperson to act in desirable ways (as benevolence moves a person to act\nfor another\u2019s good), or it enables a person to act in desirable\nways (as courage enables a person to act well). If integrity is no\nmore than maintenance of identity, however, it can play neither of\nthese roles. On the identity view of integrity, to act with integrity\nis just to act in a way that accurately reflects your sense of who you\nare; to act from motives, interests and commitments that are most\ndeeply your own. (Williams 1981a, 49)\n\nA number of criticisms of the identity view of integrity have been\nmade. First, integrity is usually regarded as something worth striving\nfor and the identity account of integrity fails to make sense of this.\n(See Cox, La Caze, Levine 1999.) It disconnects integrity from the\nprevalent view that it is a virtue of some kind and generally\npraiseworthy. Second, the identity theory of integrity ties integrity\nto commitments with which an agent identifies, but acts of\nidentification can be ill-informed, superficial and foolish. People\nmay, through ignorance or self-deception, fail to understand or\nproperly acknowledge the source of their deepest commitments and\nconvictions and we are unlikely to attribute integrity to people who\nhold true to a false and unrealistic picture of themselves. (On the\nother hand, this view of integrity as maintenance of\nidentify-conferring commitments recognizes the relevance of\nself-knowledge to acting with integrity. If people fail to\nact on their core commitments, through self-deception, weakness of\nwill, cowardice, or even ignorance, then to this extent they may be\nsaid to lack integrity.)\n\nThird, on the identity view of integrity, a person\u2019s integrity\nis only at issue when their deepest, most characteristic, or core\nconvictions and aspirations are brought into play. However, we expect\npersons of integrity to behave with integrity in many different\ncontexts, not only those of central importance to them. (See Calhoun\n1995, 245.)\n\nFourth, as noted above, the identity view of integrity places only\nformal conditions upon the kind of person that might be said to\npossess integrity. The identity view of integrity shares this feature\nwith the self-integration view of integrity and similar criticism can\nbe made of it on this ground. It seems plausible to observe certain\nsubstantive limits on the kinds of commitments had by a person of\nintegrity.\n3. The Self-Constitution View of Integrity\n\nThe self-integration view of integrity and the identity view of\nintegrity, as we described them above, place only formal limits on the\nkinds of desires and projects that might constitute an integrated\nself. Christine Korsgaard (2009) develops a distinctive picture of\nintegrity that takes the self-integration and identity views in a\nconstructivist Kantian direction. According to Korsgaard, integrity is\nnot so much a condition of excellence we aspire to as a precondition\nof being an agent at all. To the extent that we fail to live with\nintegrity, we fail to live as persons: we fail to be a self, as\nopposed to a collection of strivings; we fail to exemplify human\nagency as opposed to the unreflective satisfaction of desire.\n\nTo live with integrity is not merely to have a coherent life-plan and\nthe courage to realise it, it is to act in a way that is rationally\nendorsed both by oneself as one acts and one\u2019s future self. To\ndo this, one must act on principles and these principles must be such\nthat they would be rationally endorsed by any future self who reflects\non the matter satisfactorily. Hypothetical imperatives tie our present\nplans and our future actions together; they are necessary for agency,\nbut not sufficient. Categorical imperatives must be brought to bear if\nthe tie between present and future self is to be appropriately\nbinding. A future self must be bound to a project in light of the same\nprinciples that illuminated the project\u2019s origin, endorsable in\na process of rational reflection parallel to that at work at the\nproject\u2019s origin.\n\nKorsgaard illustrates how this process may fail, and what is at stake\nin such a failure, with an example drawn from Derek Parfit (Korsgaard\n2009, 185\u201386). A Russian nobleman wants to create a fortune in\norder to give it away to others in need. But he thinks that by the\ntime he makes his fortune, he will not be idealistic and altruistic\nenough to give his fortune away. He will likely regard his plan as the\nfolly of youth. The nobleman therefore seeks a promise from his wife\nthat the fortune will be given away even if he protests. He seeks to\nuse an external force (his wife\u2019s agency) to secure his present\nplans against his future self\u2019s abandonment of them. In such a\ncase, the present self is treating the future self as a stranger, as a\ndistinct person. To overcome this, the nobleman must formulate his\nplan according to principles that are categorical in nature.\nHypothetical imperatives have no force once their antecedent condition\nis abandoned. Only a categorical principle of action will necessarily\nform a basis for endorsing a plan now and in the future. The nobleman\nmust formulate his plan in the light of such a principle and trust his\nfuture self to endorse the plan in the light of the same principle. It\nis a risk, of course. But integrity is born of this risk. And if\nKorsgaard is right, it is not just integrity that is constituted in\nthis way, but our becoming a distinctive self is constituted in this\nway too.\n\nAccording to Korsgaard, the categorical nature of the principles\nthrough which we endorse our projects ensures that they will be\nmorally satisfactory projects. Korsgaard sums up her thinking like\nthis:\n\nAnd in the course of this process, of falling apart and pulling\nyourself back together, you create something new, you constitute\nsomething new: yourself. For the way to make yourself into an agent, a\nperson, is to make yourself into a particular person, with a practical\nidentity of your own. And the way to make yourself into a particular\nperson, who can interact well with herself and others, is to be\nconsistent and unified and whole \u2013 to have integrity. And if you\nconstitute yourself well, if you are good at being a person, then\nyou\u2019ll be a good person. The moral law is the law of\nself-constitution. (2009, 214)\n\n\nThe self-constitution view of integrity inherits many of the\nchallenges encountered by the self-integration view and the identity\nview, described above. These challenges are not decisive objections,\nbut defence of the self-constitution view will need ultimately to take\naccount of them. In addition, the view appears to rely on a\nconstructivist account of normative reasons. (See Bagnoli, 2011.) In\nparticular, the kind of agency Korsgaard appeals to when she\nidentifies integrity with successful agency and self-constitution must\nbe inescapable if it is to constitute the very possibility of being a\nperson. David Enoch (2006) argues that this kind of agency is\noptional, and that one could coherently aspire to a distinct form of\nagency \u2013 he calls it \u201cshmagency\u201d \u2013 which\nallows one to act in a practically successful way without committing\noneself to universalizable, categorical norms of action. The issue\nturns on whether the account of agency developed by Korsgaard is\ninescapable; whether is must govern reflection on what to do by any\nrational self-conscious being and whether this inescapable\ncharacteristic of agency, if it exists, stretches to an ideal of a\ncomplete life of unified agency that Korsgaard identifies with\nintegrity.\n4. Integrity as Standing for Something\n\nThe self-integration and identity views of integrity see it as\nprimarily a personal matter: a quality defined by a person\u2019s\ncare of the self. Cheshire Calhoun argues that integrity is primarily\na social virtue, one that is defined by a person\u2019s relations to\nothers (Calhoun 1995). The social character of integrity is, Calhoun\nclaims, a matter of a person\u2019s proper regard for their own best\njudgement. Persons of integrity do not just act consistently with\ntheir endorsements, they stand for something: they stand up for their\nbest judgment within a community of people trying to discover what in\nlife is worth doing. As she puts it:\n\nPersons of integrity treat their own endorsements as ones that matter,\nor ought to matter, to fellow deliberators. Absent a special sort of\nstory, lying about one\u2019s views, concealing them, recanting them\nunder pressure, selling them out for rewards or to avoid penalties,\nand pandering to what one regards as the bad views of others, all\nindicate a failure to regard one\u2019s own judgment as one that\nshould matter to others. (Calhoun 1995, 258)\n\n\nOn Calhoun\u2019s view, integrity is a matter of having proper regard\nfor one\u2019s role in a community process of deliberation over what\nis valuable and what is worth doing. This, she claims, entails not\nonly that one stand up, unhypocritically, for one\u2019s best\njudgment, but also that one have proper respect for the judgment of\nothers.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s account of integrity promises to explain why it is\nthat the fanatic lacks integrity. It seems intuitively very plausible\nto distinguish between fanatical zeal and integrity, but the\nself-integration and identity views of integrity threaten to make the\nfanatic a paradigm case of a person of integrity. Fanatics integrate\ndesires and volitions of various orders in an intimidatingly coherent\npackage; they remain steadfastly true to their deepest commitments\nlike no others. On Calhoun\u2019s view of integrity, however, we can\nlocate a distinction between integrity and fanaticism. Fanatics lack\none very important quality that, on Calhoun\u2019s view, is centrally\nimportant to integrity: they lack proper respect for the deliberations\nof others. What is not clear in Calhoun\u2019s account, and is in\nfact very hard to get clear on in any case, is what the\nproper respect for other\u2019s views in the end amounts to.\nExemplary figures of integrity often stand by their judgment in the\nface of enormous pressure to recant. How, then, is one to understand\nthe difference between standing up for one\u2019s views under great\npressure and fanatically standing by them? Calhoun\u2019s claim that\nthe fanatic lacks integrity because they fail to properly respect the\nsocial character of judgement and deliberation sounds right, but most\nof the work is done by the idea of \u2018proper\nrespect\u2019\u2014and it is not clear in the end what this comes\nto. It may be that integrity involves standing up for one\u2019s\nviews in a way that does not fully respect the differing views of\nothers. We therefore need an account of the difference between between\nfailing to respect the differing views of others (which is compatible\nwith integrity, and indeed sometimes required by it) and failing to\nproperly respect the differing views of others (something that it\nincompatible with integrity on Calhoun\u2019s account).\n\nOne way to expand upon Calhoun\u2019s account of integrity is to\nfurnish an epistemic conception of integrity. Greg Scherkoske (2011,\n2012a and 2012b, see also discussion in section 6 of this entry)\ndevelops such an account. According to Scherkoske \u201cIntegrity is\nan epistemic virtue: that is, it is a stable disposition that reliably\nplaces its possessor in good epistemic position and leads to cognitive\nsuccess\u201d (Scherkoske 2011, 196). Hugh Breakey (Breakey, 2016)\ndevelops an alternative to this approach. He argues that integrity is\na potentially dangerous trait in that possession of it can lead\nstrong-minded people to act without proper regard for the needs and\nperspectives of others. However, he argues, \u201cintegrity contains\nsubstantive moral principles that serve to surgically target the\ndangers that integrity would otherwise pose.\u201d (Breakey 2016,\n613) Integrity fits its possessor with what is required to act as a\nbenign deliberator in community with other deliberators. These are\nsubstantive rather than epistemic commitments implicit in the\npossession of integrity, and include such things as trustworthiness,\nnon-coercion, and sociability. In this way, Breakey proposes a morally\nsubstantive account of integrity that includes, not general kinds of\nmoral commitments, but specific commitments targeted at the dangers of\nbeing a self-directed and strong-minded individual. By contrast, the\nfollowing account of integrity is explicitly concerned with quite\ngeneral attitudes towards morality.\n5. Integrity as Moral Purpose\n\nAnother way of thinking about integrity places moral constraints upon\nthe kinds of commitment to which a person of integrity must remain\ntrue. There are several ways of doing this. Elizabeth Ashford argues\nfor a virtue she calls \u2018objective integrity\u2019. Objective\nintegrity requires that agents have a sure grasp of their real moral\nobligations (Ashford 2000, 246). A person of integrity cannot,\ntherefore, be morally mistaken. Understood in this way, one only\nproperly ascribes integrity to a person with whom one finds oneself\ncompletely in moral agreement. This concept of integrity does not,\nhowever, closely match ordinary use of the term. The point of\nattributing integrity to another is not always to signal unambiguous\nmoral agreement. It is often to ameliorate criticism of\nanother\u2019s moral judgment. For example, we may disagree strongly\nwith the Pope\u2019s views of the role of women in the Church, take\nthis to be a significant moral criticism of him, and yet admit that he\nis a man of integrity. In such a case it is largely the point of\nattributing integrity to open a space for substantial moral\ndisagreement without launching a wholesale attack upon another\u2019s\nmoral character.\n\nMark Halfon offers a different way of defining integrity in terms of\nmoral purpose. Halfon describes integrity in terms of a person\u2019s\ndedication to the pursuit of a moral life and their intellectual\nresponsibility in seeking to understand the demands of such a life. He\nwrites that persons of integrity:\n\n\u2026embrace a moral point of view that urges them to be\nconceptually clear, logically consistent, apprised of relevant\nempirical evidence, and careful about acknowledging as well as\nweighing relevant moral considerations. Persons of integrity impose\nthese restrictions on themselves since they are concerned, not simply\nwith taking any moral position, but with pursuing a commitment to do\nwhat is best. (Halfon 1989, 37)\n\n\nHalfon\u2019s view allows that integrity is not necessarily\n\u2018objective\u2019, as Ashford claims, and is similar in a number\nof respects to Calhoun\u2019s. Both see integrity as centrally\nconcerned with deliberation about how to live. However, Halfon\nconceives this task in more narrowly moral terms and ties integrity to\npersonal intellectual virtues exercised in pursuit of a morally good\nlife. Halfon speaks of a person confronting \u2018all relevant moral\nconsiderations\u2019, but this turns out to be quite a formal\nconstraint. What counts as a relevant moral consideration, on\nHalfon\u2019s view, depends upon the moral point of view of the\nagent. Persons of integrity may thus be responsible for acts others\nwould regard as grossly immoral. What is important is that they act\nwith moral purpose and display intellectual integrity in moral\ndeliberation. This leads Halfon to admit that, on his conception of\nintegrity, it is possible for a Nazi bent on genocide of the entire\nJewish people to be a person of moral integrity. Halfon thinks it\npossible, but not at all likely (Halfon 1989, 134\u201336).\n\nOther philosophers object to this consequence. If the genocidal Nazi\nis a possible object of ascriptions of moral integrity, then we can\nproperly ascribe integrity to people whose moral viewpoint is\nbizarrely remote from any we find intelligible or defensible. (See\nMcFall 1987 and Cox, La Caze and Levine 2003, 56\u201368. Putnam 1996\ndraws on the work of Carol Gilligan 1982 to suggest a different way of\novercoming the problem of the Nazi of integrity.) Moral constraints\nupon attributions of integrity need not take the form of\nAshford\u2019s \u2018moralized\u2019 view or Halfon\u2019s more\nlimited formal view. One might say instead that attributions of\nintegrity involve the judgment that an agent acts from a moral point\nof view those attributing integrity find intelligible and defensible\n(though not necessarily right) \u2014and that this formal constraint\ndoes have substantive implications. It prohibits attributing integrity\nto, for example, those who advocate genocide, or deny the moral\nstanding of people on, for example, sex-based or racial grounds. There\nare things which a person of integrity cannot do. The Nazis and other\nperpetrators of great evil were either committed to what they were\ndoing, in which case they were profoundly immoral (or not moral agents\nat all) and lacked integrity; or else they lacked integrity because\nthey were self-deceived or dissembling and never actually had the Nazi\ncommitments they claimed to have. Judgments of integrity would thus\ninvolve judgment about the reasonableness of others\u2019 moral\npoints of view, rather than the absolute correctness of their view\n(Ashford) or the intellectual responsibility with which they generally\napproach the task of thinking about moral questions (Halfon).\n\nMcFall (1987) contains an interesting discussion of the nature of the\nconstraints on proper attributions of integrity. She asks \u2018Are\nthere no constraints on the content of the principles or\ncommitments a person of integrity may hold?\u2019 and then invites us\nto consider the following statements (McFall 1987, 9).\n\nSally is a person of principle: pleasure.\nHarold demonstrates great integrity in his single-minded pursuit\nof approval.\nJohn was a man of uncommon integrity. He let nothing, not\nfriendship, not justice, not truth stand in the way of his amassment\nof wealth.\n\n\nMcFall holds that the fact that \u2018none of these claims can be\nmade with a straight face suggests that integrity is inconsistent with\nsuch principles.\u2019 (McFall 1987, p. 9) The question, however, is\nwhether this is due to the formal constraints or substantive\nconstraints; that is, whether attributions of integrity are\nconstrained by the content of principles a person maintains, or by way\ncertain kinds of principle fail to meet formal constraints on the way\npersons of integrity hold to their principles. McFall appears to\nsuggest the latter interpretation.\n\nIn providing reasons for our dismissal of [i] to [iii] she says (1987,\n9\u201310)\n\nA person of integrity is willing to bear the consequences of her\nconvictions, even when this is difficult \u2026 A person whose only\nprinciple is \u2018Seek my own pleasure\u2019 is not a candidate for\nintegrity because there is no possibility of conflict\u2014between\npleasure and principle\u2014in which integrity could be lost. Where\nthere is no possibility of its loss, integrity cannot exist. Similarly\nin the case of the approval seeker. The single-minded pursuit of\napproval is inconsistent with integrity \u2026 A commitment to\nspinelessness does not vitiate its spinelessness\u2014another of\nintegrity\u2019s contraries. The same may be said for the ruthless\nseeker of wealth. A person whose only aim is to increase his bank\nbalance is a person for whom nothing is ruled out: duplicity, theft,\nmurder. Expedience is contrasted to a life of principle, so\nan ascription of integrity is out of place. Like the pleasure seeker\nand the approval seeker, he lacks a \u2018core,\u2019 the kind of\ncommitments that give a person character and that make a loss of\nintegrity possible. In order to sell one\u2019s soul, one must have\nsomething to sell.\n\n\nThis is an argument that invokes formal incompatibility between\nparticular principles or goals and the proper attribution of\nintegrity. The argument is not conclusive, however. Seeking pleasure,\napproval or wealth, is not always easy and it seems possible that\nconflict could arise, for example, between determinations to pursue\nhigher or lower pleasures, long-term pleasures or immediate\ngratifications. The ruthless seeker of wealth seems to have a\n\u2018core,\u2019\u2014albeit a nasty one\u2014along with a set of\nprinciples of a sort and a set of actions that are ruled out on\nprinciple. If integrity requires a conflict between pleasure and\nprinciple, that would explain why a pure pleasure seeker lacks\nintegrity. But in this case, it seems that a perfectly virtuous agent\ndoes not possess, or need to possess, integrity. For instance,\nAristotle\u2019s model of a virtuous agent contrasts with merely\nenkratic agents who must struggle to act virtuously. The fully\nvirtuous Aristotelean agent would have no need of integrity if\nintegrity were about the struggle between pleasure and principle. (But\nsee Kristj\u00e1n Kristj\u00e1nsson, 2019.) The idea that a fully\nvirtuous agent lacks integrity does not seem plausible, however, and\nthis suggests that integrity cannot merely reside in the triumph of\nprinciple over pleasure.\n\nAccording to McFall, we judge people to be of integrity only if they\nhave commitments which a reasonable person could accept as important.\nShe writes, \u2018Whether we grant or deny personal integrity, then,\nseems to depend on our own conceptions of what is important. And since\nmost of our conceptions are informed if not dominated by moral\nconceptions of the good, it is natural that this should be reflected\nin our judgments of personal integrity\u2019 (1987, 11).\n\nHowever, she also draws a distinction between personal and moral\nintegrity (McFall 1987, 14). On her view, a person who, in acting on\nsome morally deficient principle, does morally abhorrent things may\nhave personal integrity even if not moral integrity. McFall gives the\nexample of a utilitarian lover of literature who is willing to stop\npeople burning books by killing them. She says of the utilitarian\nkiller (1987, 14), \u2018Although we may find his actions morally\nabhorrent, we may still be inclined to grant him the virtue of\npersonal integrity. We would not, however, hold him up as a paragon of\nmoral integrity.\u2019\n\nIt may be, then, that a certain kind of integrity \u2014 moral\nintegrity \u2014 should be defined in terms of moral purpose (perhaps\nalong the lines laid out by Ashford or by Halfon) and another kind of\nintegrity \u2014 personal integrity \u2014 defined in terms of other\nqualities adumbrated by theorists discussed previously. Defining the\noverall integrity of character in terms of moral purpose has the\nadvantage of capturing intuitions of the moral seriousness of\nquestions of integrity. However, the approach may also be too narrow.\nHalfon\u2019s identification of integrity and moral integrity appears\nto leave out important personal aspects of integrity, aspects better\ncaptured by the other views of integrity we have examined. Integrity\ndoes not seem to be exclusively a matter of how people approach\nplainly moral concerns. Other matters like love, friendship and\npersonal projects appear highly relevant to judgments of integrity.\nImagine a person who sets great store in writing a novel, but who\npostpones the writing of it for years on one excuse or another and\nthen abandons the idea of novel-writing after one difficult experience\nwith a first chapter. We would think this person\u2019s integrity\ndiminished by their failure to make a serious attempt to see the\nproject through, yet the writing of a novel need not be a moral\nproject.\n6. Integrity as a Virtue\n\nIf integrity is a virtue, the key questions are what sort of virtue it\nis; what is its object and characteristic motivation? Bernard Williams\n(1981a, 49) claims that integrity is not a virtue because:\n\n\u2026 while it is an admirable human property, it is not related to\nmotivation as the virtues are. It is not a disposition which itself\nyields motivations, as generosity and benevolence do; nor is it a\nvirtue of that type, sometimes called \u2018executive\u2019 virtues,\nwhich do not themselves yield a characteristic motive, but are\nnecessary for that relation to oneself and the world which enables one\nto act from desirable motives in desirable ways \u2014 the type that\nincludes courage and self-control.\n\n\nWilliams also contends that integrity does not dispose its possessors\ntowards a characteristic thought\u2014there is nothing in particular\nthat integrity leads those who possess it to attend to. He writes\n\u201cIf integrity had to be provided with a characteristic thought,\nthere would be nothing for the thought to be about but\noneself\u2014but there is no such characteristic thought, only\nthoughts associated with projects, in carrying out which a man may\ndisplay his integrity\u201d (Williams 1981a, 49). Williams holds this\nview because he sees integrity as steadfast maintenance of\nidentity-conferring commitments, a view we discussed in section 2.\nNonetheless, Williams sets out a clear challenge for those who hold\nintegrity to be a virtue. They should either set out the\ncharacteristic motivations and thoughts of those who possess the\nvirtue or explain why it is that integrity is an anomalous virtue, one\nnot associated with characteristic motivations and thoughts. There are\ntwo main ways this has been approached. One is to claim that the\nvirtue of integrity need not involve characteristic motivations or\nthoughts because it is a special kind of virtue; the other is to claim\nthat integrity is a cluster concept and thus involves multiple\nmotivations and thoughts.\n\nScherkoske (2011, 2012a and 2012b) suggests that integrity is an\nepistemic virtue, broadly conceived. In his view this explains why\nintegrity appears not to furnish its possessor with a characteristic\nsort of motivation or thought. According to Scherkoske, epistemic\nvirtues are distinct from moral virtues in just this way: they neither\ndispose agents to particular motivations or characteristic thoughts.\n\u201cIn the same way that epistemic virtues such as accuracy,\nopen-mindedness and analytical insightfulness do not specify any\nparticular content, integrity does not supply a characteristic\nthought, either\u201d (Scherkoske 2011, 201). However, it seems that\nepistemic virtues do furnish characteristic motivations. An\nepistemically virtuous person, it seems, is motivated to discover the\ntruth, the most justified belief, or something along these lines. A\nvirtuously open minded person, for example, is not motivated to\nentertain new ideas merely because they are new, they are motivated by\nthe possibility that in new ideas lie new insights and new\npossibilities for encountering the truth. A benevolent person is\nmotivated by the needs of particular others and characteristically\nthinks of what will answer these needs. An epistemically virtuous\nperson is motivated by the search for truth or justification and\ncharacteristically thinks of what will answer this quest.\nScherkoske\u2019s contrast between moral and epistemic virtues may\ntherefore be overdrawn. Scherkoske\u2019s view was discussed in\nsection 3.\n\nAn alternative view is that the concept of integrity is a cluster\nconcept, tying together different overlapping qualities of character\nunder the one term. Cox, La Caze and Levine (2003) argue that\nintegrity is a virtue, but not one that is reducible to the workings\nof a single moral capacity (in the way that, say, courage is) or the\nwholehearted pursuit of an identifiable moral end (in the way that,\nsay, benevolence is). On this view, integrity is a complex and thick\nvirtue term. One gains a fair grasp of the variety of ways in which\npeople properly use the term \u2018integrity\u2019 by examining\nconditions commonly accepted to defeat or diminish a person\u2019s\nintegrity. Integrity stands as a mean to various excesses. On the one\nside we have character traits and ways of behaving and thinking that\ntend to maintain the status quo even where acting with integrity\ndemands a change. These are things like arrogance, dogmatism,\nfanaticism, monomania, preciousness, sanctimoniousness, and rigidity.\nThese are all traits that can defeat integrity in so far as they\nundermine and suppress attempts by an individual to critically assess\nand balance their desires, commitments, wishes, changing goals and\nother factors. Thus, refusing to acknowledge that circumstance in a\nmarriage, or one\u2019s passionate desire to write a novel, have\ndramatically changed (for whatever reasons) may indicate a lack of\nintegrity\u2014a giving in to cowardice for example, and a refusal to\nacknowledge new or overriding commitments. These same factors can\ndefeat one\u2019s integrity, or an aspect of one\u2019s integrity,\nwhether one decides to stay with a marriage or abandon it. In one case\nstaying may indicate a lack of integrity, while in a different case,\nabandoning the marriage would indicate such a lack.\n\nOn the other side, a different set of characteristics undermine\nintegrity. These do not undermine the status quo as much as they make\nit impossible to discern stable features in one\u2019s life, and in\none\u2019s relations to others, that are necessary if one is to act\nwith integrity. In this category are capriciousness, wantonness,\ntriviality, disintegration, weakness of will, self deception,\nself-ignorance, mendacity, hypocrisy, indifference. Although the\nsecond of these lists dominates contemporary reflection on the nature\nof integrity, the first may also represent an ever present threat to\nour integrity. The person of integrity lives in a fragile balance\nbetween every one of these all-too-human traits (Cox, La Caze, Levine\n2003, p. 41). It is not that integrity stands as a mean\nbetween the vices that are represented in these two lists.\nRather, the person of integrity will find a mean between the excesses\nof each one of these vices, or traits or practices that can\nundermine\u2014that do undermine\u2014integrity. Some people will be\nmore prone to a certain set of practices or character traits that\nundermine integrity than others. The defeaters of integrity are\nperson-relative, and may even be situation-relative.\n\nOne worry with this kind of grab-all approach to integrity is that it\nfails to issue in clear moral judgment of individual cases. Robert\nAudi and Patrick Murphy call this the blunt instrument problem (Audi\nand Murphy 2006, 8). Attributions of integrity leave too much\nunspecified to afford clear and determinate ethical judgments, either\nof character or action. In saying that a person or an organization\nacted with integrity, for example, we fail to pass a clear and\nunambiguous moral judgment upon their action. Audi and Murphy\u2019s\nsuggestion is that the term should be used as a complement to other,\nmore specific, moral terms drawn from theories like utilitarianism and\nKantianism. Self-standing attributions of integrity are of little\npractical or intellectual value in their view (Audi and Murphy 2006,\n11). Audi and Murphy are surely right that ethical judgment of action\nis rarely if ever settled by observing that agents have acted with\nintegrity. The question remains open, however, about the work that\nintegrity attributions do. Is there anything in general that\nattributions of integrity specifically commend in a person?\n\nOn the assumption that integrity is a cluster concept of some kind,\nthe question turns on whether anything ties together the various\ntraits associated with integrity in a coherent overarching conception\nof integrity, one that makes it a clear virtue. One possibility is\nthat the traits of integrity are tied together by the idea of\nsuccessfully taking one\u2019s life seriously either in all its\nimportant aspects (personal, intimate, social, professional,\naesthetic, intellectual and emotional) or in some of them. The variety\nof qualities that Cox, La Caze and Levine claim are needed for\nintegrity might not be an awkwardly heterogeneous collection they seem\nto be at first sight if they contribute in recognizable ways to the\nbusiness of successfully taking one\u2019s life\u2014in itself and\nas lived with others\u2014 seriously. Such a view requires\ndevelopment of the idea of taking one\u2019s life seriously, but it\nmight posses certain advantages. It might have an advantage over\nintegrationist views, for example, because it promises an explanation\nof why integration seems both important to integrity and also\nsometimes in tension with it. Audi and Murphy explicitly deny this\ntension\u2014they deny that a person of integrity will experience\nvery much self-conflict except over clashing prima facie duties (Audi\nand Murphy 2006, 18). However, the idea that integrity is compatible\nwith substantial self-conflict is defended by a number of authors (see\nthe discussion of integrity as self-integration in section 1).\n\nCentral to the idea of integrity as the virtue of taking one\u2019s\nlife seriously would be the idea that a pursuit of integrity involves\nsomehow taking account of one\u2019s changing values, convictions,\ncommitments, desires, knowledge, beliefs and so on over time.\nIntegrity would thus require a robustly successful kind of\nself-examination (an examined life). Further understanding of this\naspect of integrity would likely involve examining the so-called moral\nemotions or emotions of self-assessment: regret; remorse; guilt;\nshame. These are central to the kind of self-monitoring that would be\npart of what it means to have the virtue of integrity, understood as\nthe virtue of successfully approaching one\u2019s life seriously. Far\nfrom being either unnecessary or undesirable, such emotions may be\nessential to integrity. (Pugmire (2005) discusses integrity and the\nemotions.)\n\nThis account of integrity makes it appear that integrity is much more\ndifficult to achieve than is sometimes thought. It makes integrity a\nquality of character that one may have to a greater or lesser extent,\nin certain ways but not others, and in certain aspects or areas of\none\u2019s life but not others. Having integrity is not on this view\nan all or nothing thing. To say a person has integrity is to make an\n\u201call things considered\u201d judgment: something that we may\nsay of people if we know\u2014and even if they know\u2014that in\ncertain ways and about certain things, they lack integrity.\n\nA conception of integrity as a virtue\u2014either developed along the\nlines described above or along different lines\u2014is compatible\nwith the existence of constraints on the content of the norms the\nperson of integrity is committed to. Profound moral failure may be an\nindependent defeater of integrity, just as hypocrisy, fanaticism and\nthe like are defeaters of integrity. One might judge as internal to\nsuch a conception of the virtue the idea that integrity is\nincompatible with major failures of moral imagination or moral\ncourage, or with the maintenance of wholly unreasonable moral\nprinciples or opinions. On such a view, the Nazi could not, all things\nconsidered, be a regarded as person of integrity. The Nazi may be\nself-deceiver and a liar (which is highly probable), but even if he is\nnot, his principles and his actions are not rationally defensible\nunder any coherent moral view. And this latter fact may by itself\njustify the judgment that the Nazi lacks the virtue of integrity.\n7. Types of Integrity\n\nReferences to different types of integrity, such as intellectual and\nartistic integrity, abound in the philosophical literature on\nintegrity and everyday discourse. Because integrity involves managing\nvarious commitments and values, one might conjecture that such types\nof integrity are simply manifestations of a person\u2019s overall\nintegrity, or of their personal integrity. However, there are many\npeople who we are inclined to say have intellectual but not personal\nintegrity\u2014or who have more of the former than the latter. If\nthere is a radical disjunction between the type of integrity which is\ndemanded in one sphere of life and another, integrity overall, or\npersonal integrity, may be undermined, or at least profoundly\nchallenged. There may, for example, be conflict between types of\nintegrity, such as between intellectual and moral integrity. (See Code\n1983, 268\u2013282; Kekes 1983, 512\u2013516.)\n\nIs integrity in one area of life likely to flow over into others? This\nis possible, in that the kind of reflection and self-assessment which\ngoes into maintaining integrity in one sphere of life may help people\nto reflect similarly in other spheres. However, given human\nbeings\u2019 capacity and need for compartmentalization, or\npsychologically separating out different parts of their lives, this\neffect will not necessarily occur. The relationship between different\ntypes of integrity and moral and personal integrity needs to be\ncarefully charted. Is integrity a zero-sum game, so that for example,\nthe more artistic integrity a person has, the less she has in personal\nlife? This does not seem necessarily to be the case. At the same time,\na lack of integrity in one aspect of life does not necessarily mean\nthere will be a lack in other aspects of life. Presumably, a person\ncould lack personal integrity, but still have integrity in a number of\nrestricted areas of life, such as in intellectual and artistic\npursuits.\n\nA related question is how different types of integrity are associated\nwith moral integrity. Stan Godlovitch (1993, 580) says that\nprofessional integrity, for example, is weaker than moral integrity,\nand is more like etiquette. For him (1993, 573), integrity\n\u2018trades between the norms of unity and honesty\u2019. More\nspecifically, Godlovitch (1993, 580) argues that the responsibilities\nof performers, for example, are quasi-moral; they are not truly moral\nbecause they are internal to the profession. However, it seems\nplausible to maintain that professional integrity is better understood\nas an important contribution to the living of a moral life.\nProfessional integrity is specific to the sphere of a profession, but\nnot entirely independent of morality.\n\nOne can also ask how types of integrity are distinguished from each\nother. Halfon (1989, 55) argues that we distinguish between types of\nintegrity in terms of commitments to specific kinds of ends,\nprinciples and ideals. However, not every end creates a distinct type\nof integrity. Trivial ends, like train-spotting, do not introduce a\nnew species of integrity. To count as being a type of integrity, the\nsphere of action and commitment in question should be a complex and\nvaluable human pursuit that has distinct ways in which integrity is\ndemonstrated. Robust examples are intellectual integrity and artistic\nintegrity. On this way of looking at the matter, personal integrity\nand various specific types of integrity tend to be run together.\nIntegrity is seen as the one virtue: essentially the same virtue\nexpected of one\u2019s life partner, a friend, an employee, a priest,\na teacher, or a politician. (See Benjamin, 1990; Calhoun, 1995;\nHalfon, 1989; and Grant, 1997.) Professional integrity then becomes a\nmatter of the extent to which a person displays personal integrity in\nprofessional life. Halfon (1989, 53), for example, argues that types\nof integrity may overlap, \u2018So a person who is an artist by\nprofession may come to possess professional and artistic integrity in\nvirtue of performing one and the same action or fulfilling one and the\nsame commitment\u2019.\n\nThere are, however, good reasons to resist this running together of\nvarious types of integrity. In the first place, our legitimate\nexpectations of people must be sensitive to the roles we have tacitly\nor explicitly agreed that they perform. If we expect people to act\nwith integrity in a certain professional context, then our judgment of\nthem should be based on an understanding of this context: its special\nduties, obligations, rights, competencies, and so on. What it is to\ndisplay integrity in one profession need not, therefore, carry over to\nother professions; and the difference between acting with integrity in\none context may not share a common currency with what it is to act\nwith integrity in another context. It seems that the concept of\nintegrity cannot be demarcated into types without specific\ncharacterization of the kinds of challenges and hazards encountered in\nthe relevant field of action.\n\nConsider the example of intellectual integrity. The term\n\u2018intellectual integrity\u2019 is ambiguous between integrity of\nthe intellect and the integrity of the intellectual. While it should,\nin general, be construed broadly, as integrity of the intellect, and\nthus applicable to anyone who thinks, here we will concentrate on the\nintegrity of the intellectual, or integrity as the academic\u2019s\nvirtue, as Susan Haack puts it (1976, 59). Intellectuals may differ in\nthe extent to which they exemplify intellectual virtues such as\nhonesty, impartiality, and openness to the views of others.\nIntellectual integrity may then be thought of as the over-arching\nvirtue that enables and enhances these individual virtues by\nmaintaining a proper balance between them.\n\nHalfon (1989, 54) argues that Socrates had a commitment to the pursuit\nof truth and knowledge, and he demonstrated his intellectual integrity\nin the face of attacks on it. Socrates may be an outstanding example\nof a person of intellectual integrity; nevertheless, there is more to\nintellectual integrity than having a commitment to truth and\nknowledge. Intellectual integrity is often characterized as a kind of\n\u2018openness\u2019\u2014 an openness to criticism and to the\nideas of others. However, if one is too open, one could absorb too\nmany influences to be able to properly pursue any line of thought. So\nan adequate account of intellectual integrity must incorporate\nconflicting claims: that one must be open to new ideas but not be\noverwhelmed by them. An account of intellectual integrity should\nrecognize other sources of conflict and temptations that impede\nintellectual integrity, such as the temptations offered by the\ncommercialization of research, self-deception about the nature of\none\u2019s work, and the conflict between the free pursuit of ideas\nand responsibility to others.\n\nThere are a range of commonly cited intellectual virtues central to\nour conception of intellectual integrity, such as honesty, courage,\nand fairness. Plausibly, such virtues as sensitivity and\nperceptiveness or insightfulness should also be added. In Virtues\nof the Mind, Linda Zagzebski (1996, 114) gives a very\ncomprehensive list of intellectual virtues, adding such items as\nintellectual humility, perseverance, adaptability and\ncommunicativeness. Possession of these virtues is part of what it\nmeans for a person to have intellectual integrity, although they may\nexist in varying degrees without undermining a person\u2019s overall\nintellectual integrity. There are a range of kinds of actions one\nmight expect from a person of intellectual integrity as well: for\nexample, being against plagiarism, refusing to suppress\ncounter-arguments, and consistently acknowledging help. The fact that\nthere are a number of distinct intellectual virtues, involving\ndistinct, and sometime conflicting, dispositions to action, means that\nwe have a need to balance or manage these virtues. For example, a\nperson who has too much intellectual courage may well become a\ndogmatist, and a person who is excessively impartial will probably\nlack conviction. It seems plausible to say that intellectual integrity\nis that quality that enables a person to balance the various demands\nof intellectual work and to manifest intellectual virtues in a proper\norder.\n\nThis balance cannot be maintained without a certain degree of\nreflection on the relationship between different intellectual\ncommitments. The importance of appropriate reflection to intellectual\nintegrity indicates that, like personal integrity, it is closely\nrelated to self-knowledge. Self-knowledge appears essential to\nintegrity in general, and given that intellectual integrity concerns\nknowledge itself, the relationship between having intellectual\nintegrity and self-knowledge is particularly close. This close\nrelationship might lead one to assume that self-deception is\nantithetical to intellectual integrity because it undermines the kind\nof self-knowledge, such as knowledge of our intellectual strengths and\ncapacities, necessary to such reflection. However, self-deception does\nnot necessarily undermine intellectual integrity. In fact,\nsome self-deception might be necessary to pursue some lines of thought\nwell. Having integrity may be consistent with\u2014may even\nrequire\u2014self-deceptive strategies to maintain one\u2019s\nequilibrium in the face of conflicts and obstacles. As Am\u00e9lie\nOksenberg Rorty (1994, 218) points out, self-deception can be\nnecessary to be energized to do anything. The mild self-deception that\none has a good idea before one really has an idea at all is often\nnecessary to get started on a piece of work.\n\nNonetheless, some forms of self-deception are seriously detrimental to\nintellectual integrity. Gabriele Taylor (1981, 146) believes that\nself-deception constitutes the most fundamental and important case of\nlack of integrity. She discusses an example which shows in an\nexemplary manner the dangers of self-deception\u2014that of Casaubon\nin George Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch (1994). Casaubon is a\ncleric working on the connections between different religions, a\nmammoth scholarly work he has devoted himself to for many years. In\nTaylor\u2019s view, he is self-deceived about his commitment to\nscholarship. Casaubon\u2019s problem may be seen as a conflict\nbetween his belief in his capacity and desire to write something very\nimportant and his realization of the truth that he is incapable of\ndoing so. The kind of failure of integrity here is partly due to\nfailure to take the views of others seriously, and thus differs from\ncases where others might encourage one in self-deception. Casaubon\nacted to prevent his wife Dorothea and others from realising the\npaucity of his researches. His case is more blameworthy because of\nthis failure and it demonstrates the way in which self-deception can\nundermine intellectual integrity.\n\nAnother important type of integrity is artistic integrity. Bernard\nWilliams (1981) discusses a fictionalized version of Gauguin\u2019s\nstory, a discussion that raises questions about the relationship\nbetween artistic integrity and other kinds of integrity. On\nWilliams\u2019s (1981, 22) account, Gauguin \u2018turns away from\ndefinite and pressing human claims on him in order to live a life in\nwhich, as he supposes, he can pursue his art.\u2019 In other words,\nthe fictional Gauguin left his loved ones to paint in Tahiti.\nWilliams\u2019s point is that how Gauguin judges himself and how his\nactions are judged partly depends on the success of his artistic\nproject. In Williams\u2019s view, if Gauguin\u2019s artistic project\nfails, we are apt to judge him morally deficient; if his artistic\nproject succeeds, we are likely to see his actions in a more favorable\nmoral light. Although Williams\u2019s discussion of this case is\nfocused on the concept of moral luck, there are two important issues\nconcerning artistic integrity here. First, there is the issue of\nwhether Gauguin acted with a kind of integrity at all, and second,\nthere is the issue of whether artistic integrity, if this is what\nGauguin\u2019s actions manifest, conflicts with moral and personal\nintegrity.\n\nCalhoun (1995, 244) notes that \u2018\u2026 insofar as we imagine\nthat Gauguin, in pursuing \u2018what he found his life bound up\nwith\u2019, acted merely on a psychologically deep impulse without\ncritically reflecting on the value of doing so, we may suspect him of\nnot acting with integrity\u2019. He may have lacked personal\nintegrity because he did not take an assessment of his values and\ncommitments seriously enough. Calhoun (1995, 244) suggests that\nperhaps Gauguin believes that morality does not demand he give up\npartiality to his own artistic project. If this is his view, then the\nsuccess of his artistic project may contribute to a favorable judgment\nof his moral integrity. Williams\u2019s argument that Gauguin\u2019s\nactions are given some sort of justification by the success of his\nartistic project is not entirely convincing. There is no reason to\nthink that Gauguin\u2019s project could only succeed if he turned\naway from the people that depend upon him, leaving them to a\n\u2018grim\u2019 life. Posterity may think more of him as an artist\nbecause of his work in Tahiti, but it doesn\u2019t follow that we\nshould think that Gauguin showed artistic integrity in taking his art\nto Tahiti, valuing his drive to paint in an exotic location above\nother commitments. Nor is it clear that being successful in Tahiti\ncontributes to our judgment of his artistic integrity. Would our\njudgment of his artistic integrity have suffered had he stayed at home\nproducing his art? Artistic integrity may come into conflict with\npersonal and moral integrity, but it is surprisingly difficult to\ncharacterize the precise circumstances of such a conflict.\nWilliams\u2019s fictionalized portrait of Gauguin does not\nconvincingly demonstrate such a conflict (and nor was it devised by\nWilliams for such a purpose).\n\nThere are certainly connections between artistic integrity and the\nmoral integrity of artists, which in turn is connected to the moral\nfeatures of artworks themselves. Novitz (1990, 16), for example,\nargues that the values we bring to art are social ones, and that\nso-called pure aesthetic values are themselves socially induced. At\nthe very least, the moral values which artworks suggest or promote are\nrelevant to considerations of artistic integrity. On the one hand,\nartistic integrity and moral integrity can overlap, particularly if\nthe standards of artistic integrity are high. On the other hand,\nartistic and moral integrity can come apart in situations of great\npressure. Circumstances also vary, and with them both the difficulty\nof pursuing integrity, and our assessment of its merit. Stewart\nSutherland (1996) argues that the case of Dimitri Shostakovich creates\ndifficulties for an account of integrity developed in terms of\nconsistency. The idea is that Shostakovich demonstrated equal if not\ngreater integrity than other more artistically consistent composers\nwriting in more congenial circumstances by coding his works with\nanti-Stalinist irony. More plausibly, however, one might argue that\nShostakovich showed considerable strength of character in difficult\ncircumstances whilst also admitting to his many artistic compromises,\ncompromises which affected his integrity as an artist. Thus, one might\nrate his moral integrity more highly than his artistic integrity.\nExpectations of artistic integrity have to be tempered by\nunderstanding of the conflicts and pressures, both commercial and\npolitical, involved in pursuing artistic values.\n\nDoes having one type of integrity mean that one is, to that extent,\nmoral? Halfon says that integrity in one sphere of life is admirable,\nthough less admirable than having integrity overall and a specific\ntype of integrity may interfere with moral integrity rather than be\nexpressive of it. Yet overall integrity demands that this conflict be\nmanaged in appropriate ways. Integrity is so broad that it has to\nencompass morality in a profound way. Artistic integrity is greater if\nit involves not just following the demands of the profession, but\ndoing so in such a way that one does not diminish others\u2019 lives.\nDaniel Putnam (1996, 237) expresses the point well when he says:\n\u2018Integrity reaches its highest point when it unifies and\nmaintains a balance of virtues.\u2019 In that sense, a particular\ntype of integrity, such as intellectual integrity, is greater when it\ndoes not interfere with personal and moral integrity.\n\nThere certainly can be conflict between types of integrity,\nparticularly where the demands of a profession interfere with personal\nand moral integrity. Pursuit of one particular project can prevent us\nfrom balancing our commitments, as in Williams\u2019s fictional\nGauguin case. However, while different types of integrity can be\nsequestered from each other, integrity of one type is more likely to\nflourish in a context of greater integrity in various spheres of\nexistence. The kind of virtues and skills which are developed in\nmaintaining, say, intellectual integrity, are likely to be available\nto make use of in dealing with the conflicts and temptations which\nthreaten personal and moral integrity, and conversely.\n8. Integrity and Moral Theory\n\nDespite the fact that it is somewhat troublesome, the concept of\nintegrity has played an important role in contemporary discussion of\nmoral theory. An important and influential line of argument, first\ndeveloped by Bernard Williams, seeks to show that certain moral\ntheories do not sufficiently respect the integrity of moral agents.\n(See Williams 1973 & 1981.) This has become an important avenue of\ncritique of modern moral theory. (See, for example, Scheffler 1993 and\nLomasky 1987.)\n\nModern moral theories, the most representative of which are\nutilitarianism and Kantian moral theory, do not concern themselves\ndirectly with virtue and character. Instead, they are primarily\nconcerned to describe morally correct action. Theories of morally\ncorrect action generally aspire to develop criteria by which to\ncategorize actions as morally obligatory, morally permissible, or\nmorally impermissible. Some theories of morally correct action also\nintroduce the category of the supererogatory: an action is\nsupererogatory if and only if it is morally praiseworthy, but not\nobligatory. The two theories of primary concern to Williams are\nutilitarianism and Kantian moral theory, and both of these are usually\ninterpreted as eschewing the category of the supererogatory. (See\nBaron 1995 for an argument that Kantian moral theory has no need for\nthe category of the supererogatory.) Williams maintains that both\nutilitarianism and Kantian moral theory are deeply implausible because\nof their integrity undermining effects. His argument against\nutilitarianism makes the more transparent appeal to the concept of\nintegrity and it is this argument that we examine here. (But see\nHerman 1983, Rogerson 1983, Jensen 1989, and Baron 1995, chapter four,\nfor critical discussion of the Williams\u2019s argument against\nKantian moral theory.)\n\nWilliams\u2019s argument against utilitarianism is directed against a\nparticular version of utilitarianism\u2014act-utilitarianism. This\nis, very roughly, the view that an agent is to regard as morally\nobligatory all and only actions that maximize general well-being. The\nact-utilitarian theory that Williams criticizes has an important\nfeature: it aspires to describe the correct form of moral\ndeliberation. It does more than specify what it is for an\naction to be morally correct, it specifies how an agent should think\nabout moral decisions. Agents should think about which of the actions\navailable to them will maximize general well-being and decide to act\naccordingly. Notice that this theory is completely impartial and that\nit makes no room for an agent to give special weight to personal\ncommitments, causes, projects, and the like. Act-utilitarianism\nrecognizes no personal sphere of activity in which moral reflection\noperates merely as a side-constraint.\n\nAccording to Williams, an agent who adopted this version of\nutilitarianism would find themselves unable to live with integrity. As\nhe puts it, to become genuinely committed to act-utilitarianism is for\na person to become alienated:\n\nin a real sense from his actions and the source of his actions in his\nown convictions. It is to make him into a channel between the input of\neveryone\u2019s projects, including his own, and an output of\noptimific decision; but this is to neglect the extent to which\nhis actions and his decisions have to be seen as the\nactions and decisions which flow from the projects and attitudes with\nwhich he is most closely identified. It is thus, in the most literal\nsense, an attack on his integrity. (Williams 1973, 117)\n\n\nWilliams\u2019s argument is based on the identity theory of\nintegrity, discussed above. Integrity, on this view, requires that\npersons act out of their own convictions, that is, out of commitments\nwith which they deeply identify. Act-utilitarianism seeks to replace\npersonal motivations of this kind with impartial utilitarian\nreasoning. Williams\u2019s argument appears to make acting with\nintegrity incompatible with acting in accordance with\nact-utilitarianism.\n\nWilliams develops the point with two famous and much discussed\nexamples (1972, 97\u201399). The example which best illustrates his\nargument involves the figure of George, a recent doctoral graduate in\nchemistry who is having difficulty finding work. George has young\nchildren. He also has poor health, limiting his job opportunities.\nGeorge\u2019s (unnamed) wife must work to support the family and on\nWilliams\u2019s story this causes a great deal of strain on the\nfamily. George has a strong commitment to pacifism, a conviction\namounting to an identity-conferring commitment. A dilemma arises for\nGeorge when more senior colleague tells him about a decently paid job\nin a laboratory doing work on biological and chemical warfare. If\nGeorge does not take up the job, it will almost certainly go to\nanother chemist, one without George\u2019s pacifist commitment, who\nwill pursue the development of biological and chemical weapons more\nvigorously than George. Should George take the job or not?\n\nThe most likely act-utilitarian conclusion here is that George should\naccept the job. This would contribute greatly to the well-being of his\nfamily as well as probably contributing to general welfare by\nforestalling some relatively zealous development of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Weighed in the balance are George\u2019s feelings in the\nmatter. The utilitarian calculation, if it really does come out this\nway, is demanding a sacrifice of George: that he put aside his\nopposition to, and distaste for, biological and chemical weapons\ndevelopment and deal with the anguish and alienation that may result\nfrom working in the laboratory.\n\nAccording to Williams, however, act-utilitarianism in fact demands a\ndifferent kind of sacrifice from George. It demands that he act\nwithout integrity, abandoning or ignoring a longstanding,\nidentity-conferring commitment to pacifism simply because maximum\ngeneral well-being is to be found elsewhere. This is just one,\nparticularly acute, example of the tendency of impartial utilitarian\ndeliberation to run roughshod over identity-conferring commitments,\ntreating them as no more than one source of utility among others. In\ngeneral, Williams concludes, identity-conferring commitments cannot\nplay the kind of role in act-utilitarian moral deliberation that is\nrequired for an agent to act with integrity, that is, for an agent to\nact with genuine conviction in matters of grave, identity-determining\nimportance to them.\n\nWilliams\u2019s critique of utilitarianism has spawned a large and\nimportant literature in which the argument has been interpreted and\nreinterpreted, redrafted, and much criticized. There are, nonetheless,\nthree main lines of response to the Williams\u2019s critique of\nutilitarianism. We consider them in turn. The first reply essentially\nconcedes the point and offers in response a development of utilitarian\nmoral theory, one aimed at avoiding the flaws that Williams sought to\ndemonstrate. One way to do this is by watering down the impartiality\nof utilitarian theory, explicitly factoring in the permissibility of\ngiving extra weight to one\u2019s own personal projects, commitments,\nand so on. (See Scheffler 1993 for a development of this view, and\nHarris 1989a and 1989b for criticism of the adequacy of this\nresponse.)\n\nAnother way to try and improve utilitarianism in response to\nWilliams\u2019s argument is to advance a less ambitious form of\nutilitarian moral theory. Recall that Williams criticizes a version of\nact-utilitarian moral deliberation, so one may respond to it\nby describing a version of utilitarianism that does not directly\ndictate the form of moral deliberation. Thus one might subscribe to an\nact-utilitarian account of morally correct action whilst not demanding\nthat someone like George approach life by deliberating in strictly\nutilitarian ways. Instead, utilitarianism may be thought to furnish\ncriteria from which to derive decision-procedures. (See Driver 2012,\nMoore 2007, Railton 1986, for discussion of such a view; Cox 2005,\nHoward-Snyder 1997, and Harcourt 1998 for criticism of it.)\n\nA second possible line of response to the argument is to deny the\npresupposition of Williams\u2019s argument that it is absurd for a\nmoral theory to undermine integrity. It may just be that moral demands\nupon us really are very stringent, and identity-conferring commitments\nmust sometimes (perhaps often) be sacrificed in the interests of, say,\nour acting to ameliorate preventable suffering. One might even\nconsider it a virtue of utilitarianism that it demonstrates how\ngenuinely difficult it is to preserve one\u2019s integrity when\nconfronting a world of massive and easily preventable suffering. (See\nAshford 2000 for an argument along these lines.)\n\nThe third, and most influential, line of response argues directly\nagainst the idea that utilitarianism demands that agents act against\ntheir convictions. Utilitarianism demands that agents adopt\nutilitarian ideals; that agents give utilitarian ideals the kind of\npriority that would have them function as the central\nidentity-conferring commitments of their life. Thus utilitarianism\ndoes not demand that one live without identity-conferring commitments\nat all, but that one live with utilitarian\nidentity-conferring commitments. Were George a utilitarian, he would\nnot have been acting against his convictions by taking a job in the\nchemical weapons factory. He does not lose his integrity simply in\nvirtue of his commitment to utilitarianism. Williams appears to\nconfuse the case in which a utilitarian George acts against his\npersonal interests (in which case his integrity would be preserved)\nwith the case in which a non-utilitarian George is somehow persuaded\nto act as a utilitarian (in which case his integrity would not be\npreserved). Acting as a utilitarian when one has no sympathy with\nutilitarianism may well diminish one\u2019s integrity, but such a\nloss of integrity is not attributable to utilitarianism and has no\nbearing on utilitarianism\u2019s plausibility as a moral theory. (See\nCarr 1976, Trianosky 1986 and Blustein 1991 for versions of this\ncriticism.)\n\nThe matter is not finally settled, however, for notice that\nWilliams\u2019s critique is premised on a version of the identity\ntheory of integrity. As we have seen, there are other plausible\ncandidates for an account of integrity and the critique of\nutilitarianism may well succeed better in their terms. The key issues\nare whether utilitarian commitment is compatible with a fully\nsatisfactory account of integrity, and if so, whether integrity is of\nsuch value and importance that the clash between integrity and\nutilitarian commitment undermines the plausibility of utilitarian\nmoral theory. An adequate account of integrity needs to deal with\nthese issues and to capture basic intuitions about the nature of\nintegrity: that persons of integrity may differ about what is right\nbut a moral monster cannot have integrity.\n\nStuart Rosenbaum (2015, 23, 41) claims that \u2018integrity is the\nheart of morality to most people\u2019, and that pragmatism alone can\naccommodate that centrality. He (2015, 24) argues that pragmatist\nconceptions render integrity more than \u2018useful in efforts to\nunderstand the moral life.\u2019 For Rosenbaum (2015, 27), \u2018The\nidea of integrity, focussed through the lens of pragmatism, enable a\ncohesive way of thinking about the many and diverse moral dimensions\nof life.\u2019 He (2015, 22) maintains that the idea of integrity\ndoes not \u2018play any distinctive role\u2019 in utilitarian,\ndeontological, or virtue ethics; and he laments (2015, 22, 28\u201333) what\nhe sees as the baleful historical influence of Platonism in\nmisdirecting moral philosophers\u2019 attention away from ordinary\npeoples\u2019 actual moral concerns. For Rosenbaum (2015, 34, 65),\nintegrity is not an a priori ideal, but provides for a\ncontext-sensitive, working theory of morality. A person\u2019s\nintegrity consists of their autonomy, their commitment to community\nvalues and traditions, and their commitment to the ideals of self and\ncommunity (2015, 87f.). \u2018Being a person of integrity is doing\none\u2019s best given one\u2019s values and the social and cultural\nconditions of one\u2019s environment (2015, 106). Thus Rosenbaum is\nin agreement with Williams that integrity lacks determinate content;\nbut he differs in qualifying the italicized declaration that integrity\n\u2018has no moral content of its own, no essence or ontology of\nits own, apart from the cultures, societies, and psyches that may\nrealize it\u2019 (2015, 20; cf.88). So it is that, although he sees\nuniversal applicability in this concept of integrity, and indeed in\naspects of integrity-based morality more widely, Rosenbaum (2015,\n103f.) is able to contemplate the possibility that even a\nsuicide-bomber may be a person of integrity.\n\nIn keeping with Williams\u2019 views, C\u00e9cile Laborde (2017,\n203) defines integrity as \u2018an ideal of congruence between\none\u2019s ethical commitments and one\u2019s actions\u2019, and\nargues (2017, 207) that two tests must be applied to claims (religious\nor otherwise) for exemptions from laws. These are the thick sincerity\nof the claimant, and the thin acceptability of the proposed exemption\n\u2014 which must thus be compatible with the basic rights of others. For\nLori Watson (2019, 656), no exemptions are permissible which are\n\u2018incompatible with the project of liberal egalitarian\njustice.\u2019 Giulio Fornaroli (2019, 659) goes further, concluding\nthat \u2018the notion of personal integrity is, by itself,\nunnecessary and possibly detrimental in a theory of justice.\u2019\n\n9. Integrity in relation to Social and Political Conditions\n\nEven where the social and political dimensions of integrity are\ndiscussed, integrity is often seen as largely a private or personal\naffair\u2014albeit one with important implications in the public\nsphere. Less attention has been given to ways in which social (e.g.\nfamily, business, religious) and political (e.g. forms of government)\nstructures and processes may affect personal integrity. They can do\nthis either by promoting or undermining features essential to having\nor practicing integrity; or by aiding, abetting, or being inimical to\nthe defeaters of integrity (e.g., self-deception). If integrity is as\ncentral and important a virtue as recent work on the topic suggests,\nthen ideally the institutions\u2014including forms of government and\neconomic arrangements\u2014that help shape our lives should be\nstructured in ways that promote integrity. Arguably, this is not the\ncase, and why it may not be the case, and how to change it, is as much\na problem for social and political philosophy, and ethics generally,\nas it is for philosophical psychology.\n\nSusan Babbitt (1997, 118) says that an adequate account of personal\nintegrity must:\n\n\u2026recognize that some social structures are of the wrong sort\naltogether for some individuals to be able to pursue personal\nintegrity, and that questions about the moral nature of society often\nneed to be asked first before questions about personal integrity can\nproperly be raised. Questions about integrity may turn out to be, not\nabout the relationship between individual characteristics, interests,\nchoices and so on, and a society, but rather about what kind of\nsociety it is in terms of which an individual comes to possess certain\ninterests, characteristics, and so on. This does not imply that\nquestions about personal integrity are entirely moral, not having to\ndo with idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; instead, it\nsuggests that the very meaning of personal integrity in particular\ncases sometimes depends upon more general considerations about the\nnature of the society that makes some idiosyncratic properties\nidentifying and others not. The pursuit of adequate personal integrity\noften depends, not so much on understanding who one is and what one\nbelieves and is committed to, but rather understanding what\none\u2019s society is and imagining what it could be.\n\n\nBabbitt explicitly links personal integrity to political and social\nstructures in a way that broadens the concept of integrity. What she\nsays is applicable to all of the views that we have discussed. But her\naccount also enables us to raise questions about the relationship\nbetween social structures and personal integrity. The most general\nquestion is what kinds of society and what kinds of practice within a\nsociety are most conducive to personal integrity?\n\nIf society is structured in such a way that it undermines\npeople\u2019s attempt at either knowing or acting upon their\ncommitments, values and desires, then such a structure is inimical to\nintegrity. And if integrity is connected to well-being, then adverse\nsocial and political conditions are a threat\u2014not merely an\nultimate threat, but also a daily threat\u2014to well-being. The\ntwentieth century technical term for this mismatch is alienation.\nAlienation results when people are so confused or conflicted\u2014are\nrelentlessly exposed, for example, to the social manufacture of\nincompatible desires\u2014that they take on roles they mistakenly\nbelieve they want or deceive themselves about wanting.\n\nAre political and social conditions in contemporary liberal\ndemocracies conducive both to acquiring the self-understanding\nnecessary for integrity and, more generally, to the business of acting\nwith integrity? Historically, one of the governing ideals of liberal\ndemocratic societies is to provide its citizens, not with the goods\nthey desire, but with certain primary goods, such as freedom, and with\npolitical/social/cultural structures (laws, codes, institutions,\npractices, and so on) that facilitate their capacity to obtain goods\nthey desire for themselves. This is one reason education has always\nplayed a prominent role in discussion of liberal-democratic forms of\nlife. Education is seen as a crucial structure in the facilitation of\nindividuals\u2019 pursuit of chosen goods. Such an instrumental view\nof education is rather narrow and omits any role for inculcation of\nthe means to choose goods wisely. Integrity requires more than\nfacilitation of an instrumental capacity to acquired desired goods. It\nrequires the wisdom and self-knowledge to choose appropriate goods,\nworthwhile goals, and so on. It is, perhaps, hard to see extant social\neducational structures playing a very significant role in this\nprocess, and harder still to imagine real\ninstitutions\u2014institutions compatible with the demands and\nlimitations of contemporary life\u2014that would.\n\nIf social educational structures fail to facilitate the life of\nintegrity, other structures may be positively hostile to it. Arguably,\nand despite what might seem like overwhelming choice, job markets are\nstructured by financial and other incentives, restricted opportunities\nand economic rents. The result is that many people choose careers they\ndo not really want and for which they are barely suited. There are\nother perhaps more straightforward ways in which social and cultural\nstructures may be inimical to the pursuit of integrity. The ideology\nof love, for instance, may undermine the integrity of lovers, as it\nmay undermine the possibility of genuine and realistic love. In\nprofessional life, people may be called upon (not only tacitly) to\nlie, bluff or manipulate the truth in ways that directly or indirectly\naffect their integrity. The construction of a mission statement or a\nstrategic plan is in some ways an open invitation to dissemble, pander\nand obfuscate. The expectation that one \u2018sells oneself\u2019 or\n\u2018sells the company\u2019 provides explicit reward for\nhypocrites and sycophants. And there are many kinds of assessments,\nreports and application processes that foster both deception and\nself-deception. If this is right, then contemporary society is\ninimical to a life of integrity in many small-scale ways. Broad social\nstructures also have a deleterious effect on our capacity to live with\nintegrity and here, of course, the effects of totalitarian regimes are\nmore extreme than those liberal democracies.\n\nThose who are oppressed seem to be in a paradoxical relation to\nintegrity. On the one hand, members of oppressed groups would seem to\nbe deprived of the conditions for developing integrity: the freedom to\nmake choices how to act and think. As Babbitt (1997, 118) notes, one\nneeds to be able to make choices in order to develop the kinds of\ninterests and concerns which are central to leading a life of\nintegrity. On the other hand, oppressed people are often able to\nreflect on political and social realities with the greater insight\nbecause they do not benefit from them. They have no incentive to adopt\nself-deceptive/self-protective attitudes about circumstances of\noppression or to see past them with convenient blindness. Oppressed\ngroups therefore have all the more scope to think about social reality\nwith integrity, and to act out of this understanding with integrity. A\ncapacity for reflection and understanding enables one to work toward\nintegrity even if it does not ensure that one achieves an ideal of\nintegrity.\n\nAny attempt to strive for integrity has to take account of the effect\nof social and political context. The kind of society which is likely\nto be more conducive to integrity is one which enables people to\ndevelop and make use of their capacity for critical reflection, one\nwhich does not force people to take up particular roles because of\ntheir sex or race or any other reason, and one which does not\nencourage individuals to betray each other, either to escape prison or\nto advance their career. Societies and political structures can be\nboth inimical and favorable to the development of integrity, sometimes\nboth at once.\n",
