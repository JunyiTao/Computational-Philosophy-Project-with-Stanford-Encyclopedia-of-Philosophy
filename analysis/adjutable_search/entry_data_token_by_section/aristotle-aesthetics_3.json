    "main_text": "The Poetics: How to Understand Poetry ? || What is poetry as such?\n3.1 What is poetry as such?\n\nTwo major themes run through the first part of the Poetics on\n\u201cpoetry as such\u201d: the naturalness of poetry and the\ndivision of poetry into serious and comic poetry.\n\nThe first sentence of Poetics 4 is famous for stating that\ntwo causes presided over the birth of poetry, and that those two\ncauses are natural: the instinct that all men have for mimesis and the\npleasure they take in the objects of mimesis (1448b4\u20135). A few\nlines further down, Aristotle adds to the instinct for mimesis, the\ninstinct for melody and rhythm (1448b20\u201321). What he means\nexactly by these two causes is disputed. It might seem more natural to\nopt for mimetic instinct and pleasure, taking the musical instinct as\npart of the mimetic instinct (music also being a mimesis for\nAristotle). But it should be noted on the one hand that this instinct\nfor rhythm explains the versification (which in Greek is based on the\nrhythmic alternation of long and short syllables), which can hardly be\nqualified as mimesis. And on the other hand, that the pleasure is not\nonly the one we take in the works resulting from the mimesis, but also\nin the mimesis itself. It seems that Aristotle apparently wants to\nspeak not only about the two causes which preside over the poetic\ncreation, but also about the causes which make for our attraction to\npoetic works, the two perspectives being intimately linked. Both\npoetic creation and our attraction to poetic works have as their\ncauses our mimetic instinct and our musical instinct, as well as the\npleasure that accompanies the expression of these two instincts. Here\nagain, Aristotle has a totally different vision from Plato\u2019s.\nPoets are not divinely inspired people: they are people who are\nnaturally more gifted than most other humans (1448b22). And unlike\nSocrates who in the Republic seems to advocate a\n\u201cnatural city\u201d which would not contain the mimetic arts,\nAristotle takes them as part of human nature which a\n\u201cnatural\u201d city must take into account. (One will remember\nthe vivid response of Glaucon against Socrates\u2019 proposal:\n\u201cBut this is a city for pigs!\u201d [Rep. II 372d],\nmeaning that such a city would be deprived of everything that makes\nfor a properly human city. Aristotle would have applauded)\n\nIt is from this insistence on the naturalness of poetry and the\ncentrality of pleasure that one should understand the division that\nAristotle operates within poetry, between \u201claudative\u201d and\n\u201cserious\u201d poetry, and \u201cdenigrating\u201d and\n\u201cfunny\u201d poetry, whose points of arrival are the genres of\ncomedy and tragedy. At first sight, when Aristotle introduces the\nhistory of this division, he seems to rely on an ethical or social\ndistinction: \n\n\nPoetry branched into two, according to each poet\u2019s character:\nthe more serious-minded poets represented admirable actions, that is\nto say the actions carried out by that kind of person, whereas the\nmore trivial poets depicted the actions of base people.\n(Poetics 4, 1448b24\u201326) \n\n\nPresumably, Aristotle takes it that the first poems to date must have\nbeen what we call \u201clyric poetry\u201d, with on the one hand the\npoetry of praise (such as those that Pindar would later write) and on\nthe other hand satirical poems (predating those of Archilochus), and\nwhich are the latest ancestors of the tragic and comic plays. However,\nAristotle himself qualifies such a presentation, adding that between\nthose first lyrical poems and these two much later genres, stands\nHomer, who is the author of poems depicting admirable actions in his\nIliad and Odyssey, and ridiculous ones in the\nMargites (a comic epic poem Aristotle takes to be Homeric).\nInsofar as Homer cannot be both below and above average, we must\nconclude that this distinction refers rather to what we would call\n\u201cfictional\u201d possibilities. A good poet is the one who,\nlike a good actor, knows how to put himself in the shoes of his\ncharacters, whoever they may be (17, 1455a32\u201333), and Homer was\nparticularly good at that (24, 1460a5\u201311). Moreover, there is no\nevidence that Aristotle held comedy as inferior to tragedy, nor is\nthere any reason to believe that he held the spectators or readers of\nsatires, the Margites or theater comedies to be\n\u201cinferior\u201d people. To say that \u201csuperior\u201d or\n\u201cinferior\u201d people invented serious and comic poetry is in\nfact to say that they were particularly good at impersonating those\ntypes of characters. And the reason why the characters themselves must\nbe represented either as \u201csuperior\u201d or\n\u201cinferior\u201d is due to the aims of these poetic genres. In\nthe case of tragedy, only \u201csuperior\u201d characters can elicit\nour fear and pity: the more we admire someone, the more we pity him or\nher when they don\u2019t merit their fate. Conversely, in comedy\ncharacters must be represented as \u201cinferior\u201d to elicit our\nmockery and laughter.\n\nAristotle supposes a temporal and essential filiation between these\npoetic genres: lyric poetry, both laudative and satiric (which,\nAristotle oddly supposes, must have begun before Homer); serious and\ncomic epic; and the genres of tragedy and comedy. The key moment is\nHomer. It is in Homer that \u201ctragedy and comedy loomed out\u201d\n(4, 1449a2\u20133), that is to say that poets saw in Homer\u2019s\npoems the promises of comedy and tragedy; it is from there that they\ngave birth to these new genres and developed them (Aeschylus and\nSophocles are named for being such developers). But above all,\nAristotle adds that once these genres were discovered from Homer, all\nthe poets abandoned lyric and epic poetry, and wrote in these two\ngenres, \u201cbecause these new genres had more prestige and value\nthan the older ones\u201d (1449a5\u20136). That is to say, the poets\nrealized that by writing comedies or tragedies instead of epics, they\ncould gain more prestige, and it is because of their value that people\nimmediately became attached to these new genres. But why? Because\nthese genres were entirely dramatic, and involved a fully enactive\nmimesis and used music (while epics were recited without\nmusic, at least in Aristotle\u2019s time), they fully implement our\nnatural instincts for both mimesis and music, and so they\nwere more pleasant. If pleasure is the aim of poetry, it is only\nreasonable to focus on the most pleasurable genres, tragedy and\ncomedy. (It is true that Aristotle goes back to epic after his\ntreatment of tragedy, in Poetics 23\u201326, but it is\nessentially to help better understand tragedy, and to oppose other\ncritics who took epics to be the most paradigmatic genre of\npoetry).\n\nIt is now time to ask ourselves what this pleasure of poetry might\nexactly amount to. In Poetics 4, Aristotle notoriously\nintroduces the paradoxical example of an abject animal: while seeing\nsuch an animal provokes disgust and pain in the real world, seeing a\npicture of it produces pleasure. He explains why: \n\n\nSeeing a likeness is pleasurable, because in contemplating it, people\ncome to understand (manthanein) through inference, what each\nof its details are: for example, that the man there is so-and-so.\n(1448b15\u201317) \n\n\nThis sentence has often been taken as a commitment to what we might\nroughly label a cognitivist approach to aesthetic pleasure. The\npleasure a work of art, be it a picture or a tragedy, affords would\ncome from the understanding, or actually the \u201clearning\u201d\n(the verb manthanein can mean both), it allows; and the\nexample of the man depicted in the picture would point to the idea\nthat gazing at it, we could learn something new and fresh about that\n man.[4]\n (Some interpreters have even gone so far as to read the phrase\n\u201cthe man is so-and-so\u201d as referring to his essence or a\ncertain essential quality that the picture would allow us to grasp\n[Gallop 1990]). And since this is the pleasure that a mimesis\ngenerally speaking seems to afford, it is tempting to conclude that\nthe pleasure that a tragedy or a comedy provides must be one species\nof such cognitive pleasure. But as others have replied (notably Lear\n1988, and Ferrari 1999), such an interpretation is based on an\nover-reading of the text, especially if one fully takes into account\nwhat Aristotle immediately adds: \n\n\nIn case you never saw the man before, you will not derive any pleasure\nfrom his likeness qua representation. But you will get\npleasure from the brilliant execution or the colours, or for some\nother such reason. (1448b17\u201319) \n\n\nIn other words, the \u201cunderstanding\u201d here barely amounts to\nthe recognition of the man you already knew as so and so, like\nSocrates in the portrait of him in front of you.\n\nTo be sure, there may be cases where a more complex cognitive process\ntakes place, such as in the case of a god which you recognize as being\nsuch and such, because you infer from, e.g., the statue having a\nthunderbolt in his hand, that it is intended to be Zeus. But in all\nsuch cases, there is no new learning involved. This reading of the\ntext, however natural, may seem rather unappealing. But one should\nremember that here Aristotle is only giving a description of the\ngeneral cause of our being attracted to mimesis: and indeed, were you\nnot able to recognize what the object of the mimesis is, be it the\nvoice of such and such a person, or the identity of the person\ndepicted in this portrait, you wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy it qua\nmimesis. In tragedy and comedy, we do enjoy such pleasures as well; it\nis certainly pleasant to recognize the characters and their features\nwhen they intervene in the play, and that recognition is indeed a\nsine qua non of your following a plot, and enjoying the whole\nplay; and the same goes, more basically, in cases where someone, in\nthe real world or on stage, mimics the voice or the accent of a\ncertain person: this affords you with the pleasure of recognizing who\nis meant. But all these pleasures are common to all sorts of mimesis.\nThis is perhaps the most important point. As we have seen from the\nvery first sentence of the Poetics, what Aristotle is\ninterested in is inquiring into each of the poetic genres, and the\npower each has. And indeed, what Aristotle repeatedly emphasizes\nthroughout the Poetics is that the poet must seek to produce\nthe pleasure that is proper to such or such poetic genre: \u201cone\nshould not seek any kind of pleasure from tragedy but only the\nappropriate kind\u201d (14, 1453b10\u201311). As for tragedy,\nAristotle leaves no doubt: \u201cWhat the tragic poet must produce is\nthe pleasure derived from pity and fear through mimesis\u201d\n(1453b11\u201313). Since book 2 is lost, we no longer have the\nformulation that Aristotle must have made in the case of comedy, but\nit is fairly obvious that he would have mentioned the pleasure\nassociated with the amusement provoked by the comic plot\u2019s jokes\nand gags. We do have something of an echo of such a statement in\nPoetics 13, which mentions the \u201cpleasure proper to\ncomedy\u201d, and gives the example of a comedy where Orestes would\nmake friends with Aegisthes instead of killing him: this parodic\ntreatment of the tragic end of Sophocles\u2019 or Euripides\u2019\ncorresponding play, Electra, is what creates our amusement,\nthat is our comic pleasure (1453a35\u201339).\n\nThus, the pleasure that is the aim of tragedy is an emotional\npleasure, and the same goes for comedy. In the latter case, amusement\n(of which laughter is the physical expression) is certainly not an\nemotion strictly speaking, but is rather the experience of a state of\nmind, which, like an emotion, is an affect or what early modern\nphilosophers will call a \u201cpassion\u201d. (Here we may note that\nin the quoted passage from the Eudemian Ethics, Aristotle\ndoes not shy away from using the word paschein, i.e.,\nundergoing a pathos, to describe the experience of gazing at\na beautiful thing or listening to a fine tune.) As Plato had said,\nwhen we watch tragic heroes suffering on stage, \n\n\nwe take pleasure and, surrendering ourselves, we follow and share the\nhero\u2019s sufferings and earnestly praise as a good poet whoever\nmost affects us in this way; (Rep. X 605d) \n\n\nand the same goes for comedy, which offers the opportunity of\n\u201ctaking great pleasure\u201d (606c) in letting us \u201cgive\nin violent laughter\u201d, and even \u201cbe overcome by\nlaughter\u201d (III 388e-89a). To be sure, for Plato, this is a\nsurrender to the irrational part of our soul, which may have some\ndeleterious consequences. Aristotle does not seem to be worried by\nthat, at least not in the case of adults. In one passage of the\nPolitics, he warns that letting children go to the theater\nand watch comedies where people insult one another or make obscene\njokes can be damaging, and he does not hesitate to prohibit them from\ngoing to the theater. But once \u201ctheir education has rendered\nthem immune to the harm such things can do\u201d (VII\n17.1336b22\u201323), there is no reason why adults should be\nprohibited, or even discouraged, from enjoying comic theater. In fact,\na similar point can be made in the case of tragic poetry as well: if\nin the theater (or in an epic recital), we do take pleasure when, as\nPlato vividly depicts it, \n\n\nwe hear Homer or any other tragic poet representing one of the heroes\nin a state of grief and making a long speech of lamentation or even\nchanting and beating his breast, (Rep. X 605c-d) \n\n\nit would be a shameful thing to do so in the real world (where men at\nleast were not allowed to express their grief aloud). Aristotle seems\nto take it as evident that the world of the theater is a fictive world\nthat obeys other rules than the real world, and provided we have\nreceived a good ethical education, certain \u201cpolitically\nincorrect\u201d features, such as laughing at incongruous insults or\n\u201csharing the hero\u2019s sufferings\u201d and his \u201cstate\nof grief\u201d in a boisterous manner should not cause any harm.\nQuite to the contrary, Aristotle seems to take tragic emotions and\namusement as typical human propensities, which give us lots of\npleasures when they are experienced in the theater.\n3.2. Tragedy\n\nThe best tragedy, as we have seen, is the one that can best produce\nthe power typical of a tragedy, i.e., producing pity and fear, and\ntherefore can best achieve its function or aim, which is the pleasure\nthat comes from the experience of these emotions. What Aristotle\nproposes in his analysis of tragedy is highlighting the means by which\nthe poet can implement this function, which in turn should provide\ntheater goers with the right understanding they need to have in order\nto be able to judge the quality of such and such a play they may\nattend, or read. As Aristotle announced right at the beginning, the\nplot is to be considered the most important means and indeed it is\ngiven the most expansive treatment, while the other\n\u201celements\u201d of the tragedy, such as the depiction of the\ncharacters and their expression (or what we more commonly call the\nstyle, in which their dialogues are written), come next. This focus\nimposes itself from the perspective of the aim or function of poetry.\nA tragedy typically depicts the change of fortune which includes\nreversal of circumstances and sufferings, and rightly so: this is of\ncourse how fear and pity for the main heroes can be produced. Thus,\nthe actions of the heroes that lead to such an outcome must be what a\ntragedy should mainly depict, or represent, as well as other features\nthat are part and parcel of that outcome. The way plots are\nconstructed or assembled from the various deeds and words of the\ncharacters (or what Aristotle calls the \u201cevents\u201d,\npragmata) should be what constitutes \u201cthe aim\u201d of\nthe poet (Poetics 6, 1450a22\u201323). This is the aim a\npoet must seek if he wants to end up with a tragedy that can fulfill\nits aim or function properly. \n\n\nIf a poet were to string together tirades describing characters,\nhowever perfectly composed in terms of expression and reasoning they\nmight be, he will not be able to achieve what we have said is the\nfunction of tragedy: (1450a29\u201331) \n\n\npresumably he might well provide a certain pleasure to his public (if\nonly for the beauty of his style), but he would not obtain the proper\naim or function of tragedy.\n\nThere are two series of requirements for a plot to be a good plot. One\nseries involves the qualities of the plots, which includes totality,\nunity and generality (or: universality); the second one involves the\nturning points of the plot, which include the reversal of\ncircumstances, the recognition, and the sufferings. But both series\nare based on what a proper consumption of tragedy requires: the first\nseries is about our being involved in a plot; the second series, about\nwhat creates the emotions of pity and fear. Producing the pleasure\nthat comes from the emotions of pity and fear is the aim of tragedy,\nbut in order to achieve this, the poet must create a plot the hearers\ncan immerse themselves in; as we would say, a theater audience must\n\u201cbelieve\u201d in the story that is unfolding and in the\ncharacters who make up the story. Otherwise, they would just lose\nattention and interest, which would prevent any strong emotional\ninvolvement. One such requirement is that of \u201cthe fitting\nsize\u201d. In the case of gazing at a beautiful animal, whether in\nreality or in a picture, our admirative enjoyment cannot hold if the\nanimal or the picture is so big that it cannot be grasped in one\nglimpse, or if it is too minute to be seen at our ease. The case of a\ntragic plot is similar: a proper size is needed to make the whole play\n\u201ceasy to remember\u201d (6, 1450b34\u201351a6). One must be\nable to remember the important features and events the full time we\nwatch it, which is a sine qua non condition for our being\nunflaggingly attentive and attracted to the plot.\n\nAnother such sine qua non requirement is what one may call\nthe \u201claw of likelihood\u201d, or \u201cplausibility\u201d.\nAristotle strongly insists on this: all events must offer the\nappearance of causality, and follow not one after the other, but from\neach other (10, 1452a20\u201321). Faced with an event that is totally\nunexpected in being disconnected from any normal causal sequence would\njust be incredible, and, in worst cases, hearers would laugh instead\nof feeling pity or fear. Of course, unexpectedness can be an efficient\ntool for evoking strong reactions. For example, \n\n\nwhen the statue of Mitys in Argos killed the person responsible for\nthe death of Mitys himself by falling on him as he was staring at it,\n(9, 1452a7\u20139) \n\n\nit must have created a big surprise, and putting such an event into a\nplot might be very powerful. But even if the event happened by pure\ncoincidence, the poet must suppose that his audience will, even if\nsubconsciously, admit a certain divine vengeful intention behind the\nevent, so it appears to them as having a certain plausible cause. The\npoet has full license for inventing whatever events he wants, but they\nmust appear \u201cplausible\u201d in one way or another. Or as\nAristotle summarizes, \n\n\nthe function of the poet is not to speak of what has happened but of\nthings such as they might happen, that is to say, to tell us of\npossible outcomes in all likelihood or out of necessity.\n(1451a36\u201338) \n\n\nThe weight is not so much on the fictionality of events, since the\npoet can also draw his material from events that actually occurred,\nbut in the way he presents them: whether they actually happened or\nnot, and whether they are physically possible, he must describe them\nin the way we would think they might happen. It is to be noted that\n\u201cin all likelihood or out of necessity\u201d is a rephrasing of\nthe well-known \u201cfor the most part or out of necessity\u201d\nmotto in the Physics, where \u201cfor the most part\u201d\ndescribes what actually happens to physical things which obey causal\nnecessity, barring a few exceptions. In the case of poetry, or any\nother mimetic genre, the only causality we need is\n\u201csubjective\u201d causality, or plausibility. Aristotle even\ngoes so far as to say: \u201cWhat is impossible but plausible must be\npreferred to what is possible but not credible\u201d (24, 1460a27):\nan event that has taken place, and so is physically possible, but\nwhich would not be presented in a plausible way would not succeed in\ngripping hearers.\n\nIt is in this context that Aristotle makes a comparison with history:\nwhile history must report hard facts as they actually happened, poetry\nmust tell them as they might happen according to the law of\nplausibility. It is in this context where we find one of the most\nfamous, and famously contentious, sentences of the Poetics:\n\n\n\nThis is the very reason why writing poetry is more philosophical and\nmore worthy than writing history. For poetry tends towards a general\npicture (katholou), whereas history tells us of particular\ncase studies. (9, 1451b5\u20137) \n\n\nIt is very tempting to interpret this as if Aristotle were proposing\nthat poetry dealt with \u201cuniversals\u201d in the usual sense of\nthe term, and thus conveyed \u201cuniversal truths\u201d. Many\nphilosopher readers have assigned Aristotle a grandiose view of\npoetry, while historians have blamed him for undermining the\nimportance of history. Both are probably overreactions. Aristotle does\nnot say that history is not philosophical, but that poetry is\n\u201cmore philosophical\u201d than history. Since philosophy is the\nsearch for causal understanding, we may suppose that\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d means, in effect: \u201cthat which sees\nthings under the perspective of causality\u201d. Of course, history,\nas Herodotus claims in the very first sentence of his\nHistories, is also a search for the causes of the events he\nreports; but his main focus must be to report and explain those events\nas they actually happened, for example \u201cwhat Alcibiades did or\nwhat happened to him\u201d (1451b11). What the poet does is to take\nwhatever event he may want to introduce into his plot and turn it into\na plausible one\u2014even the most factually impossible events! \n\n\nFor nothing prevents what really happened to be turned into things\nsuch as they might happen in all likelihood or be possible\u2014it is\nthis which makes him the poet of these. (1451b30\u201332) \n\n\nThis makes poetry, in the active sense of the term \u201cmaking\npoetry\u201d (the word poi\u00easis allows for both\nmeanings), a \u201cmore philosophical\u201d craft. And this involves\n\u201cuniversals\u201d in a non-technical sense, as Aristotle\nexplains: \n\n\nA general picture is this: the kind of thing a certain type of person\nwould say or do in all likelihood or out of necessity.\n(1451b8\u20139) \n\n\n\u201cGeneral\u201d, or \u201cuniversal\u201d, does not describe\nhere a specific item, but the way how one may expect someone will say\nor do things given the person she is. And that goes not only for\ntragedy, but also for comedy where (contrary to most tragedies which\ndraw their plot from well known myths) particular names of the\ncharacters are up to the poet\u2019s choice and added after the plot\nis written (1451b11\u201314): thus, here too, the crucial thing is to\ncreate a plausible plot where all the deeds and words done or uttered\nby the play\u2019s characters seem to be causally related; this is\nwhat makes them plausible to an audience.\n\nThe second type of requirement involves the content of the plot.\nGenerally speaking, a plot is constituted by all the events making up,\nas we say, the \u201cdramatic action\u201d. But what counts\nprimarily among such events are three features. First, the reversal of\ncircumstances which \u201cis a volte-face change in the sequence of\nevents\u201d (11, 1452a22\u201323). This must happen \u201cin all\nlikelihood or out of necessity\u201d as Aristotle insists, otherwise\nthey would not achieve their aim, which is to provoke strong emotional\nreactions in the public. Emotional reaction is also created by\nrecognitions: after, or just before, something important happens to a\ncharacter, he or she is recognized as having such and such relation\ntowards his or her protagonist (1452a36\u2013b3). And, last but not\nleast: audience members respond to sufferings (path\u00ea),\nor rather what Aristotle determines as \u201can action conducive\neither to death or great pain\u201d (1452b11\u201312), thus an act\nof violence that causes great suffering. This action is best conducted\nwhen it involves kin: it is much more powerful, emotionally speaking,\nto watch a scene in which, e.g., a mother is going to kill her son, or\na daughter her father (14, 1453b19\u201322). In such tragic scenes,\ninvolving unexpected yet plausible changes of fortune, startling\nrecognitions, and acts of violence, managing them in the right way is\nabsolutely key if one wants to elicit the tragic emotions. These are\npity and fear, which are the two moments, or aspects, of the same\nemotional experience, where fear concerns primarily the moment when a\ncharacter is about to commit the irreparable towards his kin, while\npity comes about at the sufferings and deep misfortunes of the\ninvolved parties.\n\nIf plot is at tragedy\u2019s core, that is not to say that the\nplay\u2019s other features are of no importance. That is especially\nthe case for how the characters are depicted, and how they speak. Both\nare a significant factor in rendering a plot successful. In a word,\ncharacters must be credible: when we see a character doing or\nsaying such and such, we must believe in them. Characters must be\nnormally virtuous, for otherwise we couldn\u2019t admire them, and\npity requires that we think that their misfortune is unmerited.\nConversely, a woman shouldn\u2019t be presented as talking like a\nphilosopher (such as Menalippe in one of Euripides\u2019 play),\nbecause no ancient Greek spectator would ever expect to see a woman\nspeaking like a male philosopher (15, 1454a16\u201332). Building\ncharacters that correspond to an audience\u2019s expectations is key\nif one wants to immerse them in a tragic play. As to the\n\u201cexpression\u201d, or the style, characters must speak in a\nrelatively clear and common way, so the spectators can easily follow\nthe plot. But figures of style such as rare words or metaphors must be\nadded at the right times, especially when what a character says may\nadd to the scene\u2019s emotional impact. Aristotle compares two ways\nof saying the same thing: \n\n\nIn his Philoctetes, Aeschylus had written: \u201cThe ulcer\nwhich eats the sole of my foot\u201d, whereas Euripides replaced\n\u201ceats\u201d by \u201cfeasts on\u201d\n(thoina\u00f4). (22, 1458b19\u201324) \n\n\nThe rare, poetic verb that Euripides used produces an unusual\nimpression, and for that very fact strikes the spectators, which is of\ncourse a means of still further increasing the pity they feel for this\ncharacter whose foot is affected by a painful gangrene.\n\nBy reconstructing how tragedies can best implement their function,\nAristotle intended to help his readers to become better judges and\nappreciators of the tragedies they could read or attend in the\ntheater. But for any modern reader, there remain two perplexing\nquestions. Whereas pity and fear are normally painful emotions, how\nare we to conceive of them as pleasurable? And what about the most\nenigmatic word of the Poetics, katharsis, which also\nseems to be presented as the aim of tragedy?\n\nSince the Renaissance, the theme of katharsis, which appears\nin the definition of tragedy (tragedy is \u201ca mimesis of a\nmomentous action\u201d, which \u201cby stirring up pity and fear,\nbrings about a katharsis of such\nemotions\u201d\u20146,1449b25\u201328), has been the subject of\nendless debates, as Aristotle himself never explains himself about it.\nThe interpretive conundrum is basically this. Normally, the word\nitself refers to the action of rendering something \u201cpure\u201d\n(katharos), with all the possible senses or connotations of\n\u201cpure\u201d: purification in a religious context (such as\nOrestes who undergoes a katharsis when digging in the sea to\nbe \u201cpurified\u201d of the murder of his mother, which Aristotle\nrefers to at Poetics 17, 1455b15), purgation in a medical\ncontext, or cleaning in the case of an object that is dirty. It might\nmean either in principle, but we might expect the word to get its\nmeaning from its context of use. But what is the context supposed to\nbe in the case of tragedy? Aristotle does not tell us. In\nPolitics VIII, he briefly mentions a kind of music, the\nso-called \u201centhusiastic music\u201d, which provides a medical\ncure that consists in a katharsis for those who are\nespecially prone to \u201centhusiasm\u201d (or what we would call\n\u201cfrenzy\u201d, or \u201cagitation\u201d). And then he adds:\n\n\n\nThe same thing, then, must be experienced by those who are especially\nprone to pity and fear and in general by those who are suffering from\ntheir emotions (pathetikoi) on the one hand, and by any other\nperson to the extant as she shares in those emotions on the other\nhand: they all undergo a certain katharsis and get a pleasant\nfeeling of relief. (Pol. VIII 7, 1342a11\u201315) \n\n\nAt least for the pathetikoi, the context seems to be medical.\nBut is it the case for \u201ceach other person to the extent that she\nshares in those emotions\u201d, i.e., notably the spectators of\ntragedy? When Aristotle refers to \u201ca certain\nkatharsis\u201d (tina katharsin), he may mean\neither that all these people, the pathetikoi as well as\nanyone else, undergo the same sort of medical katharsis, or\nthat they each undergo a different sort of katharsis.\n\nThe best known scholar forcefully endorsing the first interpretation\nremains Jakob Bernays (whose nephew by marriage, Freud, adapted the\nviews to psychoanalysis): Aristotle, a doctor\u2019s son, would have\ndefended tragedy against Plato\u2019s rejection by conceiving of it\nas sort of beneficial cure for all theater spectators (Bernays 1858).\nThat interpretation (which has known several refinements, especially\nin German scholarship; collected in Luserke 1991) has been fiercely\ncriticised for reducing tragedy to being a medical cure. Whereas\nBernays was actually reacting against the strong ethical views of the\nGerman writer and philosopher Lessing, many contemporary scholars have\nproposed coming back to such views. According to one reading, defended\nby Richard Janko, the tragic katharsis should be conceived of\nas the purgation of the excessive emotions so as to obtain the right\nmeasure of pity and fear, which nicely matches Aristotle\u2019s\nconception of virtue (see especially Janko 1992). But Aristotle seems\nadamant in the text of Politics VIII that music for\nkatharsis is to be differentiated from music for moral\neducation (7, 1341a21\u201324; 1341b38). And in the Poetics,\nAristotle takes it as evident that emotions must be strongly\nexperienced; aiming at the right, moderated measure of pity would\nactually spoil the typical pleasure that a good tragedy provides!\nOthers, notably Martha Nussbaum, have suggested that in the case of\npeople who go to the theater to enjoy the emotions of fear and pity,\nkatharsis might mean \u201cclarification\u201d (i.e., the\nremoval of obscurities; in his logical works, Aristotle does use the\nadverb kathar\u00f4s in the sense of \u201cclearly\u201d);\nthe tragic theater would then aim at providing spectators with a\nclarification of the pitiful, indeed tragic, human\n condition.[5]\n As philosophically engaging as that reading may be, there is no\ntextual proof that Aristotle would have adopted such a grandiose view;\nand contrary to Nussbaum\u2019s own views on ethics, where pity is\nconsidered a central ethical emotion, pity only plays a very marginal\nrole in Aristotle\u2019s ethics. Yet another kind of reading, relying\non the idea that pity presupposes that the object must primarily be\nthe spectator him- or herself, has insisted on the relief that such an\nemotional releasing might offer, consisting in a\n\u201cconsolation\u201d: as Jonathan Lear states, \n\n\nIn tragedy, we are able to put ourselves imaginatively in a position\nin which there is nothing further to fear. There is consolation in\nrealizing that one has experienced the worst, there is nothing further\nto fear, and yet the world remains a rational, meaningful place in\nwhich a person can conduct himself with dignity. (1988: 326; A reading\nof a similar kind has been offered by Munteanu 2012: 131\u2013136)\n\n\n\nAgain, this is a fascinating approach of the ultimate meaning of\ntragedy, but it does not seem that Aristotle himself ever expressed\nsuch an idea of \u201cconsolation\u201d.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that a much more minimalist reading might better\nsuit Aristotle\u2019s texts. One such reading, advocated by John\nFerrari, is to take the word katharsis as a way to describe\nthe process of relieving the tension created by the stimulation of the\ntragic emotions (Ferrari 1999, 2019). The great advantage of this\ninterpretation is that it does not presuppose anything beyond the\ncontext of the Poetics, and it does not seem to contradict\nany other explicit statement of Aristotle\u2019s; but one may wonder\nif it really explains the phrase, the \u201ckatharsis of\nsuch emotions\u201d, where the idea of \u201ctension\u201d, or\n\u201csuspense\u201d, does not seem to be present. Another such\nreading might look like the following. In his biological works,\nAristotle regularly uses the word katharsis to refer to the\nmenstrual blood or bleeding as well as to the male ejaculation: in\nthose cases, katharsis means the flowing itself (or by\nmetonymy, the blood); and the fluid is nothing deleterious\n(interestingly enough, against Hippocratic views, Aristotle does not\ntake menstrual blood to be \u201cimpure\u201d). He holds rather only\nthat keeping such fluid inside the body without discharge can be\nunhealthy, and so a discharge is needed from time to time. As\nAristotle knew very well, ancient theater audiences showed their\nemotional reactions in a very physical way by screaming and weeping\nloudly. So, the katharsis of the emotions of pity and fear\ncould be meant to name that sort of physical expression or outlet of\nsuch emotions. This last reading might perhaps not appear worthy of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophical genius. But it would fit the aim\nAristotle has himself proposed: to explain how a tragedy accomplishes\nits function, which is to produce the emotions of pity and fear, and\nthe pleasure accompanying them. Saying that a tragedy is a\nmimesis which \u201cby stirring up pity and fear, brings\nabout a katharsis of such emotions\u201d might simply mean\nthat tragedy should indeed aim to allowing spectators to express and\nunleash their emotions in the\n theater.[6]\n\nThe second perplexing question involves what modern aestheticians call\nthe \u201cparadoxical pleasure of negative emotions\u201d. How is it\nthat we can enjoy emotions such as pity and fear that are normally\npainful? It is quite often assumed that katharsis can do just\nthat, transform the pain of those emotions into pleasure, through the\nfeeling of relief that accompanies it. But it would be very\ncounter-intuitive to reduce the pleasure any audience gets from a play\nto just that pleasure, which follows or is the consequence of a\nkatharsis. For one would then have to suppose that a theater\naudience would suffer all through the play to finally undergo a\nkatharsis, and get their pleasure at the play\u2019s end, on\nleaving the theater! As Aristotle surely noticed himself, an audience\nthat has felt great fear for heroes on the verge of grave suffering\nand has wept and cried during a two hour show, will normally leave the\ntheater with a physical sense of relief. But when he says that the\npoet must \u201cproduce the pleasure from pity and fear through\nmimesis (dia mim\u00ease\u00f4s)\u201d, Aristotle\nprobably wanted to allude to the fact that mimesis is what\nmakes those emotions a source of pleasure. How are we understand this\nmore precisely? Relying on Kendall Walton\u2019s theory of\n\u201cmake-believe\u201d, one might be tempted to take mimesis here\nas what would allow spectators to pretend to have those emotions. But\nnothing indicates that Aristotle would have shared such a conception;\non the contrary, describing what even the simple reading of such a\npowerful plot as Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus-Rex would produce,\nhe speaks of shuddering or getting goosebumps (phrittein),\nwhich seems to indicate that we actually experience strong emotional\nreaction (14, 1453b3\u20136). (And the same would hold for pity which\nproduces tears). Thus, insofar as we immerse ourselves in a tragic\nplot and \u201cbelieve\u201d in its characters, it is probably in\nsome way a painful emotional experience. But we also know that a story\nexperienced in this way takes place in an imaginative world, where\nthere is no real object to be feared. Thus mimesis, one might say,\nallows us to experience fear for itself (and as Aristotle says in a\npassage from De Anima, imagining fearful objects is \u201cup\nto us\u201d, while seeing them in the real world is not:\n427b14\u201321), which is pleasurable. This is not to say, though,\nthat this would annihilate the painfulness of the experience. As Plato\nexplicitly said (and there is no reason to think Aristotle would have\ndisapproved), this is precisely what makes tragic pleasures so\nparadoxically attractive: they are a kind of mixture of pain and\npleasure (Philebus\n 48a).[7]\n\n3.3 Comedy\n\nMany if not most scholars seem to consider tragedy to be the best\npossible kind of poetry in Aristotle\u2019s eyes. But Aristotle never\nsuggests that; on the contrary, he insists that tragedy and comedy,\neach constituting a fully enactive mimesis, are the most\nperfect genres of poetry, each one corresponding to our natural\ninclinations for tears and laughter. Whereas the tragic poet must\nproduce strong emotions in order to enjoy a tragic play, the comic\npoet must produce amusement, which finds its physical expression in\nlaughter. (Also, as a few lines from the neo-platonists Iamblichus and\nProclus forcefully suggest, it might well be the case that Aristotle\nthought there was a katharsis in comedy as well, which would\nperfectly fit the last proposed interpretation: a comic\nkatharsis would just amount to the expression or the outlet\nof\n laughter.)[8]\n\nIn chapter 5 of our Poetics, Aristotle presents comedy with\nthese terse words: \n\n\nComedy, as we have already said, is the representation of men of\nlesser value, but not in a sense that would imply all defects:\nridicule is only a part of what is shameful. What makes people laugh\nis indeed a form of error or physical ugliness which does not cause\nsuffering or death, as is immediately seen from a comedy mask: it is\nsomething ugly and deformed, but which does not express any suffering.\n(1449a32\u201337) \n\n\nScholars have often drawn on the idea that aggressiveness or, as\nBergson would say, \u201cmalice\u201d, would be at the heart of\ncomedy as Aristotle sees it. And indeed, this is already what Plato\ndefends in a famous passage of the Philebus (47d-50b): it\nwould be phthonos (an emotion that is often translated as\n\u201cmalice\u201d or \u201cill will\u201d, but that designates\nabove all \u201cenvy\u201d) that would be the hidden cause of our\nlaughter (Imagine your neighbor, whose new Ferrari you envy,\ninadvertently crashing it into his garage door: the strength of your\nlaughter would be proportional to your\n envy!).[9]\n\nBut let us return to the example of the comedy he mentions in\nPoetics 13, where spectators see Orestes ending up being\nreconciled with Aegisthes. What makes them laugh at that ending?\nUndoubtedly, the ancient spectators must have felt a sense of\nindignation: not avenging one\u2019s father by killing his murderer\nis a moral fault. But it cannot be indignation that causes them to\nlaugh (if anything, indignation provokes anger, not amusement). What\nmakes them laugh, rather, is the complete oddity of such a\nreconciliation, its sheer incongruity. So more generally, one may\nsuppose, what makes one laugh is the incongruity of the blunders of\nthe characters on stage, perhaps coupled with their ugliness (which is\nmoreover accentuated by the mask the actors wear). That these\ncharacters must be \u201cinferior\u201d is a psychological\nrequirement that is the opposite of that of tragedy: if we can only\nfeel fear and pity towards a hero who does not deserve his fate, we\nreadily laugh at a man full of himself who slips on a banana peel.\nSimilarly, Aristotle\u2019s insists that a character\u2019s blunders\nmust not cause him to suffer, and that therefore a comedy cannot end\nwith the characters\u2019 misfortune or death. That would not be\nfunny: a comedy in which the arrogant character killed himself on a\nbanana peel would end our amusement (provided we are average, morally\ngood people). And this also implies that our negative feelings towards\nsuch characters, made up of a certain contempt and perhaps a feeling\nof superiority (as Hobbes would say), is really just a kind of game:\nwe do not feel any real animosity or condescension towards comedy\ncharacters. If we really felt indignation when attending that comedy\nof Orestes, we would not be able to laugh.\n\nIn the third book of the Rhetoric, dedicated to the figures\nof speech, Aristotle recalls that in his Poetics, presumably\nin its second book on comedy, he spoke of different \u201ctypes of\njokes\u201d (III 18, 1419b6\u20137). There is perhaps a difference\nof emphasis on this point between comedy and tragedy. If a comedy must\nalso have a good plot, having good jokes is essential: \n\n\nIt is especially in regard to these [funny comparisons] that poets\nfail with the public if they do not make them well, and if they do\nmake them well, that they are popular. (11, 1413a10\u201311) \n\n\nIt is impossible to reconstruct what exactly those \u201ctypes of\njokes\u201d would have been. But in his treatment there of the\nfigures of speech, Aristotle evokes those that the comic poet uses.\nThe central idea that emerges is that of incongruity. Aristotle argues\nthat a serious speech that wants to persuade its listeners must use a\n\u201csuitable\u201d, or \u201cappropriate\u201d style, where the\nwords chosen are \u201cin proportion\u201d (to analogon) to\nthe things they signify. If there is disproportion, or what we call\n\u201cincongruity\u201d, that speech\u2019s style will be\n\u201clike that of comedy\u201d. And to exemplify what he seriously\nstates, Aristotle makes a joke at the expenses of a tragedy writer, a\ncertain Cleophon, whose style was (at least in Aristotle\u2019s eyes)\nrather like a comedy writer\u2019s: \u201cSome of his expressions\nwere like saying: august fig tree\u201d (III 7, 1408a10\u201316).\nThis expression is funny (and not at all appropriate to the tragic\nstyle), because there is a total incongruity between this adjective\nwhich is normally reserved for a goddess or a queen, and that tree\nwhich, in ancient Greece, was considered of little value.\n\nIn the case of tragedy, Aristotle\u2019s aim is to reconstruct for\nhis readers what the art of poetic composition should be, in order to\nenable them to distinguish a good tragedy from a bad one and to\nexplain why. There is no reason to think that this should not also\nhave been his goal in writing on comedy. We have no direct echo of\nthis in our Poetics, but a passage from the Nicomachean\nEthics provides a clue worth following. It comes from the chapter\ndevoted to the virtue of \u201csense of humor\u201d\n(eutrapelia), which consists in being able to make good jokes\namong friends as well as in being able to take mockery against oneself\nwith good grace. It is in this context that we read this statement:\n\n\n\nThe amusement of the free man is very different from that of the\nslave, that of the educated man from that of an uneducated man. This\ncan be seen also in the ancient and recent comedies: in the former,\nwhat makes one laugh is obscene language, in the latter, it is rather\nthe innuendos (huponoia), and this difference is not small in\nview of elegance (eusch\u00eamosun\u00ea). (IV 8,\n1128a20\u201325) \n\n\nTo be sure, this is an analogy that is intended to make clear what\nkind of jokes decent citizens should make or hear in the real world.\nBut this analogy also reveals the normative judgment that Aristotle\nsuggests when it comes to theater: good comedy, that which is intended\nfor educated audiences, should use innuendo and allusion, not obscene\nlanguage. This is not an ethical normativity, but a normativity\nintrinsic to the art of making people laugh. Jokes that use crude and\nobscene language are what might be called \u201ceasy jokes\u201d,\nwhich require no originality and inventiveness on the part of the\njokester. On the contrary, good jokes must be \u201crefined\u201d,\nor \u201celegant\u201d, which show a good, truly incongruous and\nsophisticated use of the figures of\n speech.[10]\n4. Music and the Value of Art\n\nWhat is the value of poetry, or art more generally? Neither in the\nPoetics nor in the published works on poetry does Aristotle\nseem to be bothered by that question. But since this is yet another\nperplexing question for us, many scholars have been tempted to supply\nan ethical answer. Interpreting the katharsis clause in this\nway has been one major way of satisfying the urge to answer this\nquestion. But even without relying on that admittedly controversial\nphrase, other ethically tinged answers have been offered. For example,\nwhy can\u2019t we read tragedies as providing us an attractive way to\ndevelop a typically \u201cemotional understanding\u201d of important\nethical features, such as the importance of being moved by other\npeople\u2019s misfortunes (Halliwell 1986, 2002)? Or, more\nspecifically, shouldn\u2019t tragedies allow for imagining ethical\nsituations that would help spectators illuminate issues linked to\ntheir use of practical wisdom (Frede 1992; Belfiore 1992; Donini\n 2004)?[11]\n There is certainly much to say in favor of such readings, especially\nif one focuses on, say, Antigone or Philoctetes. But\nwhen Aristotle mentions these plays, he does not at all give the\nimpression that he takes them to be paradigmatic of the genre (In the\nPoetics, he mentions the former in the framework of a\ncritique of the quite untragic way Sophocles has depicted Haemon, who\ndid not dare to kill his father Creon: 14, 1454a1\u20132; as to the\nlatter, one verse of Euripides\u2019 lost play is quoted for the\nappropriate use of a rare verb: Poetics 22,\n1458b22\u201324). Instead, the two plays that he seems to take as\nparadigmatic (and to which he refers the most) are Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus-Rex and Euripides\u2019 Iphigenia in\nTauris. Certainly, Oedipus-Rex can easily be read as\nproviding a kind of insight into the deep miseries a human being can\nbe subjected to; but one may fairly doubt that it might really help\npeople in their use of practical wisdom. As to Iphigenia in\nTauris, it would require a tremendous battery of arguments to\npersuade modern readers that they should read it in a either such\nway\u2014and it is no surprise that no scholar has attempted to do\nso!\n\nMore generally, there are at least two main rebuttals to be made\nagainst such ethical readings of the Poetics (and presumably\nAristotle\u2019s aesthetics in\n general).[12]\n First, what then about comedy? When he mentions a possible positive\nuse of comedy, Plato proposes that virtuous citizens watch them for a\nbetter grasp of what vices look like: \u201cWe must learn to\nrecognizes buffoonery in order to avoid doing or saying anything\nridiculous out of ignorance\u201d (Laws VII 816e). It is\ntelling that Aristotle never mentions such an odd suggestion: how can\nwe possibly learn about vice while we are enjoying the jokes and\ngaffes that pepper comedic plots? A second reply comes from what\nAristotle says about music in Politics VIII. There, he begins\nby repeating faithfully what Plato had proposed: since music can\nrepresent virtues like courage, children must learn to play it and it\nis through enjoying singing and playing such music that they will\nsubconsciously come to enjoy those virtues. But then, in a second\ninstance, Aristotle vigorously, if implicitly, opposes Plato. In the\nLaws, Plato very much insists that adult citizens of Magnesia\nmust continue singing and dancing in order to bolster their virtues\n(II 664d). Aristotle is no less insistent that once adults, the\ncitizens of his ideal city stop singing and playing music and instead\nhire professional musicians and enjoy listening to them during their\n\u201cfree time\u201d (VIII 6, 1340b35\u201339).\n\n\u201cFree time\u201d or \u201cleisure\u201d\n(schol\u00ea) is a key concept (on this, see Too 1998; Heath\n2014; and Ferrari 2019). It does not mean the pause or the rest one\ntakes from work; it is a time, or a mode of life, where activities are\nenjoyed for themselves. In the Nicomachean Ethics, it is at\nthe core of the argument for the primacy of theoretical activity:\nwhile contemplation is typically a leisured activity, political\nactivities constitute the non-leisured life, one which is meant to\nachieve practical goals (X 8, 1177b4\u201324). And in\nPolitics VII-VIII, when defending his own proposal as how\norganize a perfect city, Aristotle goes as far as saying: \u201cTo be\nable to enjoy leisure rightly is the principle of everything\u201d\n(VIII 3, 1337b31\u201332). In the case of music, Aristotle makes it\nclear that if music can be listened to for the practical purpose of\nrelaxation (a little bit like our ambient music), or fostering virtue\n(as children must do), music can also be listened to for its own sake,\njust for the sake of enjoying it. Here Aristotle seems to be repeating\nwhat he says in the passage of the Eudemian Ethics already\nquoted, but he adds something we do not find there: music \u201cfor\nthe sake of leisure\u201d is characterized as a music \u201cfor the\nsake of intelligence (phron\u00easis)\u201d (VIII\n5, 1339a14\u201326).\n\nUnfortunately, Aristotle does not spell out what exactly he means by\nthat, and the phrase has been variously interpreted. Again, some\nscholars have proposed an ethical reading: the intelligence involved\nwould amount to the practical intelligence, or wisdom (which is\ntypically called phron\u00easis), that is required in any\nmoral action. Thus, by listening to music that depicts, or\n\u201crepresents\u201d, say, courage, one may better understand what\ncourage is. Despite its seeming natural, this reading contradicts what\nAristotle repeats in those same pages: moral, or political, action is\nfundamentally a non-leisured activity (ascholia). It would be\nodd then if Aristotle were recommending such a leisured use of music\nwhile aiming to describe how to manage non-leisured moral life!\nAnother theme that is also repeated in those pages should give us a\nbetter clue: the final aim of learning how to sing and play an\ninstrument is to help these future citizens become \u201cgood\njudges\u201d of music (VIII 6, 1340b35\u201339). In the\nLaws, Plato also used that phrase, and meant by it that adult\ncitizens should be able to recognize morally good from morally bad\nsongs, and thus enable them to decide which songs must be sung in\nMagnesia (II 669a-670c). There is no reason to believe Aristotle would\nhave endorsed such a strong ethical-cum-political agenda. Instead, it\nis very likely that by \u201cjudging\u201d, Aristotle just means\nthat by having the first-hand experience of playing music, citizens\nwill be able to judge and appreciate the good quality of music. And,\nas all musical connoisseurs know, such an appreciation is both\nperceptual (as we do enjoy listening to sounds and rhythm) and also\nsomehow intellectual: a connoisseur, that is, equally enjoys how well\nor inventively a piece of music is\n constructed.[13]\n\nAdmittedly, all of this is absent from the Poetics, where the\nword \u201cleisure\u201d does not even appear. But when in the\nPolitics, he presents his conception of a music that should\nbe listened to and appreciated for its own sake, it is surprising that\nAristotle gives as justification the example of Homer, and cites\nseveral verses from the Odyssey: besides music for relaxation\nand moral education, there is \n\n\nmusic for a life spent in leisure, which is the very reason why people\nbring it in. They give it a place among the leisure time that they\nthink befits free people. That is why Homer wrote these verses:\n[\u2026] \u201cThey invite the bard who charms them all\u201d. And\nelsewhere, Odysseus says that the best way to spend one\u2019s life\nis in view when men are rejoicing: \u201cthe guests sit in a row in\nthe room to listen to the bard\u201d. (VIII 3, 1338a21\u201330) \n\n\nOf course, Aristotle must have been aware that the bard is the one who\nsings poetry, whether lyric or epic, with the accompaniment of the\nlyre. This argument therefore implies that it is actually the\nlistening and appreciation of performed poetry that must constitute\nsuch a leisured activity. And since in the Poetics, tragedy\nand comedy are presented as poetic forms that are more valuable than\nepic or lyric poetry, Aristotle must also have considered attending\ntragic and comic plays as part of these leisured activities, or more\ngenerally of what he calls in that passage of the Politics, a\n\u201cfree life\u201d, that is a life of free citizens (not of\nslaves), but also a life that in which time is spent enjoying music or\npoetry for their own sake.\n\nIn the case of music, Aristotle strongly recommends that children\nlearn how to play an instrument (actually, the lyre) so that once\nadults they will be able to fully enjoy beautiful songs since they\nwill have become able to \u201cjudge the beautiful songs\u201d and\ntherefore \u201cenjoy them for themselves\u201d (Pol. VIII\n6, 1340b38\u201339). This is also the case for visual arts: children,\nAristotle proposes, should learn how to draw images in order to be\nable \u201cto contemplate the beauty of bodies\u201d\n(1338a40\u2013b2). In both cases, their pleasure can be taken along\nthe lines in which Aristotle defines pleasure in his Nicomachean\nEthics: it is the unimpeded activity, or\n\u201cactivation\u201d, of their natural capacity, or faculty, of\nhearing and seeing respectively. But Aristotle importantly adds:\n\u201cwhen it comes to the best possible object\u201d to be heard or\nseen (NE 10.4, 1174b14\u201323). We therefore need to learn\nhow to judge how good the objects of our listening or seeing are. And\nonce we have learned this, we can fully enjoy pieces of music and\npaintings or sculptures that we know are those that best suit our\nrespective faculties. \n\nAristotle never makes such a suggestion in the case of poetry; and\nindeed, if one holds that poetry is a matter of exceptional natural\ngift, as Aristotle does, it would be odd to propose that every child\nshould practice composing poetry. One might then perhaps take his\nwritings on poetry offered as a sort of late education on such\nartworks. Through their reading of either the Poetics (if\nthey get the chance of enrolling in the Lyceum) or Aristotle\u2019s\npublished works, people can become such connoisseurs of poetry, and\nenjoy it fully too. \n\nIt is often claimed that the ancients did not value artworks in the\nways we moderns do. Ancient Greek theater, which includes poetry,\nscene painting and music, the argument goes, is only one moment of\nreligious festivals where a whole city came to unite in shared\nactivities and values. And despite all his critiques of the theater,\nfor which he coined the despising word \u201ctheatrocracy\u201d\n(Laws III 701a), Plato nevertheless emphasized that the right\nsorts of poetry and music should play a crucial role in the moral\neducation of youth. But Aristotle seems very much unconcerned about\nthe religious and political context of theater performances; and it is\ntelling that he doesn\u2019t say anything worth noticing about the\nrole of the gods in the tragedies. (Actually, these elements are even\na matter of reproach that classicists often make against\n him![14])\n And he vividly opposes a complete subjection of art to any other\nuseful objective: \u201cTo search everywhere for what is useful is\ntotally inappropriate for those who are great in soul and free\u201d\n(Pol. VIII 3, 1338b2\u20134). In other words, if indeed it\nmay be useful to listen to some sorts of music for educational or\ntherapeutic purposes, music can, and should, also be enjoyed for\nitself, and the same goes for painting and poetry. To be sure, by\nthemselves, the objects of mimesis may not be worthy. But even the\nlowest animals, as Aristotle states in the preface of his Parts of\nAnimals, do offer \u201cextraordinary pleasures to those who are\nable to know their causes and are naturally gifted for philosophical\nunderstanding\u201d (I 5, 645a9\u201310). In the case of animals and\nplants, we admire the way \u201cartistic nature\u201d\n(d\u00eamiourg\u00easasa phusis) has built them. In the\ncase of artworks, \n\n\nwe enjoy gazing at likenesses of animals because we are at the same\ntime contemplating how artistic craft (d\u00eamiourg\u00easasa\ntechn\u00ea), whether painting or sculpture, has produced them;\n(645a11\u201312) \n\n\nthat is, when we are connoisseurs of art. True, as Aristotle also says\nin that preface, divine beings such as celestial bodies and unmoved\ngods are much more worthy objects to contemplate (mostly because they\nare eternal). And indeed, as he repeats in his Nicomachean\nEthics and Politics, philosophical contemplation, which\nculminates in exercising our intellect towards such divine objects, is\nthe highest activity one can attain. But such philosophical\ncontemplation, whether it comes to these divine entities or to the\ncauses of the animals and plants, is deemed to remain for the\n\u201cnaturally gifted for philosophical understanding\u201d which\nare few, as Aristotle seems to admit with regret. By contrast,\nprovided one gets the right artistic education leading to\nconnoisseurship, contemplating art can be part and parcel of\neveryone\u2019s happiness (or typically human flourishing:\neudaimonia).
