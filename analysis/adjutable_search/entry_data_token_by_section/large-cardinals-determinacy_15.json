    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Structure Theory\n4.2  Structure Theory\n\nFor definiteness, when we speak of the \u201cstructure\ntheory\u201d (at a given level) we shall be referring to the\nregularity properties introduced above\u2014the perfect set property,\nand the property of Baire, and Lebesgue measurability\u2014along with\nthe uniformization property. There is actually much more (as indicated\nabove) to the structure theory and what we shall have to say\ngeneralizes. We shall concentrate on two levels of definable\ndeterminacy\u2014\u0394\u033011-determinacy\nand ADL(\u211d). Again, this is just for\ndefiniteness and what we shall have to say generalizes to certain\nhigher forms of definable determinacy. \n\n The\naxiom \u0394\u033011-determinacy\n(equivalently, Borel-determinacy) is a theorem of ZFC and lies at the\nheart of the structure theory of Borel sets (and, in fact,\nthe \u03a3\u033011-sets\nand \u03a3\u033012\nsets). One virtue of ADL(\u211d) is that it lifts\nthis entire structure theory from the Borel sets to the sets\nin L(\u211d). Summarizing results from above we have: \n\n\nTheorem 4.1. Assume ZFC +ADL(\u211d). Then every set of reals in L(\u211d) has the perfect set property, the property of Baire, is Lebesgue measurable, and \u03a321-uniformization holds in L(\u211d).  \n\n\n Many descriptive set theorists take these consequences to be\nintrinsically plausible. Moreover, they have found the particular\npattern of the uniformization property provided by\nADL(\u211d) to be a plausible extension of the\npattern initiated in ZFC. For this last point consider the first\n\u03c9 many levels and compare the case of V = L with\nthat of PD. In ZFC, the uniformization property propagates\nfrom \u03a0\u033011\nto \u03a3\u033012. It\nis natural to expect it to continue to zig-zag back and\nforth. However, under V = L it stabilizes: \n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Uniformization under V = L.\n\n\nIn contrast, PD provides what appears to be the correct\nextrapolation: \n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Uniformization under PD.\n\n\nAgain, this \u201cperiodicity phenomenon\u201d occurs at higher\nlevels in L(\u211d). \n\n One might grant that these are indeed fruitful consequences of\nADL(\u211d) and as such are evidence that\nADL(\u211d) holds. However, one might be concerned\nthat perhaps there are axioms that share these fruitful consequences\nand yet are incompatible with ADL(\u211d). As a\nresponse, one might note that this objection is never raised in the\nanalogous case of physics where a multitude of incompatible theories\ncan agree in their empirical consequences. But there is a much\nstronger response that one can make. For in contrast to the case of\nphysics\u2014where one could never hope to show that there was only\none theory with the desired empirical consequences\u2014in set theory\nthis is actually the case; more precisely, any theory that has these\nfruitful consequences\u2014that is, which lifts the structure theory\nto the level of L(\u211d)\u2014must imply\nADL(\u211d). This remarkable fact is embodied in\nthe following theorem: \n\n Theorem 4.2 (Woodin). Assume that all sets in L(\u211d) are Lebesgue measurable, have the property of Baire, and that \u03a321-uniformization holds in L(\u211d). Then ADL(\u211d).  \n\n\n Summary: There is a \u201cgood theory\u201d (one that lifts the\nstructure theory) and all good theories imply\nADL(\u211d). \n",
