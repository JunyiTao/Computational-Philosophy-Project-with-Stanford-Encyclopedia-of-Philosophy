    "main_text": "The Method in Mathematics\n8. The Method in Mathematics\n\nIn a letter to Mersenne written toward the end of December 1637,\nDescartes intimates that \n\n\n[in] the Optics and the Meteorology I merely tried\nto show that my method is better than the usual one; in my\nGeometry, however, I claim to have demonstrated this. (AT 1:\n478, CSMK 3: 77\u201378) \n\n\nGeometrical problems are perfectly understood problems; all the\nconditions needed to solve the problem are provided in the statement\nof the problem (see\n Section 1). To solve any problem in geometry, one must find a\nline(s) that bears a definite relation to given lines. \n\n\nAll the problems of geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that\nthereafter we need to know only the length of certain straight lines\nin order to construct them. (AT 6: 369, MOGM: 177) \n\n\nThese lines can only be found by means of the addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, division, and root extraction of given lines. While it\nis clear how these operations can be performed on numbers, it is less\nclear how they can be performed on lines. What, for example, does it\nmean to multiply one line by another?\n\nA very elementary example of how multiplication may be performed on\nlines can be seen in the problem of squaring a line. Let line a\nbe the given line, and let it be required to multiply a by itself\n\\((x=a^2).\\) To find the value of x, I simply construct the\nsquare \\(a^2\\) below (see\n Fig. 7):\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^3\\)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Line, square, and cube. The\nproblem of dimensionality.\n\n\nThis example clearly illustrates how multiplication may be performed\non lines, but its simplicity conceals a problem. Descartes\u2019\npredecessors regarded geometrical constructions of arithmetical\noperations in an extremely limited way: due to the fact that in\ngeometry there are only three spatial dimensions, multiplication\nbeyond the cube proved difficult. A number can be represented by a\nline, the square of a number by a surface (a square), and the cube of\na number by a solid (a cube), but beyond the solid, there are no more\ndimensions in which to represent the multiplication of \\(n > 3\\)\nlines (see Mancosu 2008: 112) (see\n Fig. 7).\n The \u201cproblem of dimensionality\u201d, as it has since come to\nbe known, constituted a serious obstacle to the use of algebra in\ngeometry (ibid.). Suppose the problem is to raise a line to the fourth\npower \\((x=a^4).\\) For Descartes\u2019 predecessors, this made\nabsolutely no geometrical sense.\n\nDescartes solved the problem of dimensionality by showing how\narithmetical operations performed on lines never transcend the line.\nFor example, if line AB is the unit (see\n Fig. 8),\n and I want to multiply line BD by BC, \u201cI have only to join the\npoints A and C, then to draw DE parallel CA, and BE is the product of\nthis multiplication\u201d (AT 6: 370, MOGM: 177\u2013178).\nDescartes\u2019 procedure is modeled on similar triangles (two or\nmore triangles whose sides may have different lengths but whose angles are equal). The sides of all similar\ntriangles are proportional to one another (e.g., triangle ACB is\nsimilar to triangle DEB, such that BC is proportional to BE and BA is\nproportional to BD, etc.) (see Euclid\u2019s\n Elements VI.4\u20135\n [1908: [2] 200\u2013204]). By exploiting the theory of proportions,\nDescartes could easily show that BA:BD=BC:BE, or \\(1:a=b:c\\) (e.g.,\n\\(1:2=2:4,\\) so that \\(2\u20222=4,\\) etc.), in which case\n\\(a\u2022b=c\\) or \\(\\textrm{BD}\u2022\\textrm{BC}=\\textrm{BE}.\\) The\nmultiplication of two or more lines never produces a square or a\nsolid, but only another line segment that bears a definite\n(proportional) relation to the other line segments. All magnitudes can\neasily be compared to one another as lines related to one another by\nsome measure or proportion, effectively opening the door to the\nunrestricted use of algebra in geometry.\n\n\n\nFigure 8 (AT 6: 370, MOGM: 178, D1637:\n298). [An\n extended description and SVG diagram of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHaving explained how multiplication and other arithmetical operations\ncan be employed in geometry (AT 6: 369\u2013370, MOGM:\n177\u2013178), Descartes proceeds to describe how the method should\nbe applied to problems in geometry:\n\n\nThus, if we wish to solve some problem, we should first of all\nconsider it solved, and give names to all the lines\u2014the unknown\nones as well as the others\u2014which seem necessary in order to\nconstruct it. Then, without considering any difference between the\nknown and the unknown lines, we should go through the problem in the\norder which most naturally shows the mutual dependency between these\nlines, until we have found a means of expressing a single quantity in\ntwo ways. This will be called an equation, for the terms of one of the\ntwo ways [of expressing the quantity] are equal to those of the other.\n(AT 6: 372, MOGM: 179)\n\n\nThis is the method of analysis, which will also find some application\nin metaphysics (see\n Section 9).\n To apply the method to problems in geometry, one must first\n\u201cconsider [the problem] solved\u201d, using letters to name\nboth known and unknown lines. One must then produce as many equations\nas there are unknown lines, and each equation must express the unknown\nline in terms of the known lines. (Equations define unknown magnitudes\nin terms of known magnitudes. For example, the equation \\(x^2=ax+b^2\\)\ndefines the unknown magnitude \u201cx\u201d in relation to\nthe known magnitudes \u201ca\u201d and\n\u201cb\u201d, thereby expressing one quantity in two ways.)\nFinally, one must employ these equations in order to geometrically\nconstruct the required line(s).\n\nDescartes provides an easy example in Geometry I. The line\nsegments a and b are given, and I must construct a line\nx such that \\(x^2 = ax+b^2.\\) The construction proceeds as\nfollows (see\n Fig. 9).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 (AT 6: 375, MOGM: 181, D1637:\n302). [An\n extended description and SVG diagram of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFirst, I draw a right-angled triangle NLM, such that \\(\\textrm{LN} =\n1/2 a\\), \\(\\textrm{LM} = b\\) and the angle \\(\\textrm{NLM} =\n90\u00ba.\\)\n\nSecond, I draw a circle with center N and radius \\(1/2a\\).\n\nThird, I prolong NM so that it intersects the circle in O.\n\nMO = x, the required line segment.\n\nProof: By Elements III.36,\n\\(\\textrm{MO}\u2022\\textrm{MP}=\\textrm{LM}^2.\\) Therefore,\n\\(x(x-a)=b^2\\) or \\(x^2=ax+b^2\\) (see Bos 2001: 305).\n\nThis procedure is relatively elementary (readers not familiar with the\nrelevant Euclidean constructions are encouraged to consult\nEuclid\u2019s\n Elements III.36\n [1908: [2] 73\u201375]). The method employed is clear. The problem\nis algebraically expressed by means of letters for known and unknown\nmagnitudes, and an equation is produced in which the unknown magnitude\nis expressed exclusively in terms of known magnitudes. The unknown\nmagnitude is then constructed by the addition of a line that satisfies\nthe equation. The construction is such that the solution to the\nproblem can be intuited or directly seen in spatial\nintuition by the intellect aided by the imagination (or on paper,\nwhich embodies the operations of the intellect on line segments in the\nimagination). Geometrical construction is, therefore, the foundation\nof intuition in Cartesian geometry, and it constitutes the final step\nin the solution to any problem.\n\nDescartes employed his method in order to solve problems that had\nnever been solved in the history of mathematics. One such problem is\nthe \u201cPappus problem\u201d, a locus problem, or problem in which\none must find the locus (location) of all points satisfying a definite\ncondition (equation), stated by the fourth-century Greek mathematician\nPappus of Alexandria (c. 300\u2013350): \n\n\n[If] we have three, or four, or a greater number of straight lines\ngiven in position, we must first of all have a point from which we can\ndraw as many other straight lines, one on each of the given lines,\nwhich form given angles with them. (AT 6: 379, MOGM: 184) \n\n\nsuch that a definite ratio between these lines obtains. In the case of\nlocus problems involving more than six lines (in which three lines on\none side of the equation must be shown to have a proportional relation\nto four lines on the other side), Pappus believed that the problem of\ndimensionality prohibited solutions to these problems, \u201csince\nthere is no figure of more than three dimensions\u201d, so that\n\u201ca figure contained by these lines is not understandable in any\nway\u201d (ibid.). For Descartes, by contrast, geometrical sense can\nbe made of the multiplication of any number of lines. Descartes\nprovides a completely general solution to the Pappus problem: no\nmatter how many lines, he demonstrates how it is possible to find an\nequation and produce a construction satisfying the required conditions\n(see Bos 2001: 313\u2013334). More broadly, he provides a complete\nenumeration of the types of problem one encounters in geometry\n(defined by degree of complexity); enumerates the geometrical\nconstructions required to solve problems in each class; and defines\nthe class of geometrically acceptable constructions by whether or not\nthey can be algebraically expressed.\n",
