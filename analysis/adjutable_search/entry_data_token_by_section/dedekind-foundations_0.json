    "main_text": "Biographical Information\n1. Biographical Information\n\nRichard Dedekind was born in Brunswick (Braunschweig), a city in\nnorthern Germany, in 1831. Much of his education took place in\nBrunswick as well, where he first attended school and then, for two\nyears, the local technical university. In 1850, he transferred to the\nUniversity of G\u00f6ttingen, a main center for scientific research in\nEurope. Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians of\nall time, taught in G\u00f6ttingen, and Dedekind became his last\ndoctoral student. He wrote a dissertation under Gauss, finished in\n1852. As was customary, he also wrote a second dissertation\n(Habilitation), completed in 1854, shortly after that of his\ncolleague and friend Bernhard Riemann. Dedekind stayed in\nG\u00f6ttingen for four more years, as an unsalaried lecturer\n(Privatdozent). During that time he was strongly influenced\nby P.G.L. Dirichlet, Gauss\u2019s successor in G\u00f6ttingen, and by\nRiemann, then a rising star. (Dedekind did important editorial\nwork for Gauss, Dirichlet, and Riemann.) In 1858, he moved to the\nPolytechnic in Z\u00fcrich (later ETH Z\u00fcrich), Switzerland, to\ntake up his first salaried position. He returned to Brunswick in 1862,\nwhere he became professor at the local university and taught until his\nretirement in 1896. He published most of his major works in this later\nperiod. He also had interactions with important mathematicians\nelsewhere; thus he was in correspondence with Georg Cantor,\ncollaborated with Heinrich Weber, and developed an intellectual\nrivalry with Leopold Kronecker. He stayed in his hometown until the\nend of his life, in 1916. (Cf. Landau 1917, ch. 1 of Dugac 1976,\nScharlau 1981, Mehrten 1982, ch. 1 of Ferreir\u00f3s 1999, Harborth\net al. 2007, Sonar 2017, for biographical information.)\n\nDedekind\u2019s main foundational writings are: Stetigkeit und\nirrationale Zahlen (1872) and Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen? (1888a). Equally important, especially in the eyes of\nhistorians of mathematics, is his work in algebraic number theory.\nThat work was first presented in an unusual manner: as supplements to\nDirichlet\u2019s Vorlesungen \u00fcber Zahlentheorie. The latter\nwas based on Dedekind\u2019s notes from Dirichlet\u2019s lectures, edited\nfurther by him, and published in a series of editions. It is in his\nsupplements to the second edition, from 1871, that Dedekind\u2019s famous\ntheory of ideals was first presented. He modified and expanded it\nseveral times, with a fourth edition published in 1893\n(Lejeune-Dirichlet 1893, Dedekind 1964) and an unfinished fifth\nedition later found in his Nachlass (Scheel 2020). An\nintermediate version of Dedekind\u2019s theory appeared separately in a\nFrench translation (Dedekind 1877). Further works by him include: a\nlong and influential article on the theory of algebraic functions,\nwritten jointly with Heinrich Weber (Dedekind 1882, Dedekind &\nWeber 2012); and a variety of shorter pieces in algebra, number\ntheory, complex analysis, probability theory, etc. All of these works\nwere re-published, together with selections from his\nNachlass, in Dedekind (1930\u201332). Finally, lecture notes\nfrom some of his own classes were made available later (Dedekind 1981,\n1985), as were further selections from his Nachlass (Dedekind\n1982, also Dugac 1976, Sinaceur 1990, Schlimm 2000) and from his\ncorrespondence (Noether & Cavaill\u00e8s 1937, Lipschitz 1986,\nMeschkowski & Nilson 1991, Scheel 2014).\n\nAs this brief chronology indicates, Dedekind was a wide-ranging and\ncreative mathematician, although he tended to publish slowly and\ndeliberately. It also shows that he was part of a distinguished\ntradition in mathematics, extending from Gauss and Dirichlet through\nRiemann, Dedekind himself, Weber, and Cantor in the nineteenth\ncentury, on to David Hilbert, Ernst Zermelo, Emmy Noether, B.L. van\nder Waerden, Nicolas Bourbaki, and others in the twentieth and\ntwenty-first centuries. With some partial exceptions, these\nmathematicians did not publish explicitly philosophical treatises. At\nthe same time, all of them were very sensitive to foundational issues\nin mathematics understood in a broad sense, including the choice of\nbasic concepts, the kinds of reasoning to be used, and the\npresuppositions build into them. Consequently, one can find\nphilosophically pregnant remarks sprinkled through their works, as\nexemplified by Dedekind works.\n\nNot much is known about other influences on Dedekind, especially\nphilosophical ones. While a student in G\u00f6ttingen, he did attend a\nlecture class by Hermann Lotze, called \u201cDeutsche Philosophie\nseit Kant\u201d (\u201cGerman philosophy since Kant\u201d), as is\nclear from notes he took that are preserved in his Nachlass. In his\nshort biography of Riemann (Dedekind 1876a), there is a reference to\nthe post-Kantian philosopher and educator J.F. Herbart, professor in\nG\u00f6ttingen from 1833 to 1841, as an influence on Riemann; and in\nhis correspondence, Dedekind mentions the German Idealist J.G. Fichte\nin passing (Scharlau 1981, Reck 2017). However, he does not align\nhimself explicitly with either of them, nor with any other philosopher\nor philosophical school.  Little is known about which philosophical\ntexts might have shaped Dedekind\u2019s views, especially early on. A rare\npiece of information we have in this connection is that he became\naware of Gottlob Frege\u2019s most philosophical work, Die Grundlagen\nder Arithmetik (published in 1884), only after having settled on\nhis own basic ideas; similarly for Bernard Bolzano\u2019s Paradoxien\ndes Unendlichen (Dedekind 1888a, preface to the second\nedition). Then again, several of Dedekind\u2019s mathematical role models\nhad strong philosophical interests, especially Gauss, Riemann, and\nCantor; and German intellectual life at the time was saturated with\ndiscussions of Kantian and German Idealist views, including debates\nabout the role of intuition for mathematics, and there is evidence\nthat Dedekind was familiar with at least some of them.\n",
