    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThere are two competing mathematical strategies that are used in\nconnection with physical theory; one emphasizes rigor and the other\npragmatics. The pragmatic approach often compromises mathematical\nrigor, but offers instead expediency of calculation and elegance of\nexpression. A case in point is the notion of an infinitesimal, a\nnon-zero quantity that is smaller than any finite quantity.\nInfinitesimals were used by Kepler, Galileo, Newton, Leibniz and many\nothers in developing and using their respective physical theories,\ndespite lacking a mathematically rigorous foundation, as Berkeley\nclearly showed in his famous 1734 treatise The Analyst\ncriticizing infinitesimals. Such criticisms did not prevent various\n18th Century mathematicians, scientists, and engineers such as Euler\nand Lagrange from using infinitesimals to get accurate answers from\ntheir calculations. Nevertheless, the pull towards rigor led to the\ndevelopment in the 19th century of the concept of a limit by Cauchy\nand others, which provided a rigorous mathematical framework that\neffectively replaced the theory of infinitesimals. A rigorous\nfoundation was eventually provided for infinitesimals by Robinson\nduring the second half of the 20th Century, but infinitesimals are\nrarely used in contemporary physics. For more on the history of\ninfinitesimals, see the entry on\n continuity and infinitesimals.\n\nThe competing mathematical strategies are manifest in a more recent\ndiscussion concerning the mathematical foundations of quantum\nmechanics. In the preface to von Neumann\u2019s (1955) treatise on\nthat topic, he notes that Dirac provides a very elegant and powerful\nformal framework for quantum mechanics, but complains about the\ncentral role in that framework of an \u201cimproper function with\nself-contradictory properties,\u201d which he also characterizes as a\n\u201cmathematical fiction.\u201d He is referring to the Dirac\n\\(\\delta\\) function, which has the following incompatible properties:\nit is defined over the real line, is zero everywhere except for one\npoint at which it is infinite, and yields unity when integrated over\nthe real line. Von Neumann promotes an alternative framework, which he\ncharacterizes as being \u201cjust as clear and unified, but without\nmathematical objections.\u201d He emphasizes that his framework is\nnot merely a refinement of Dirac\u2019s; rather, it is a radically\ndifferent framework that is based on Hilbert\u2019s theory of\noperators.\n\nDirac is of course fully aware that the \\(\\delta\\) function is not a\nwell-defined expression. But he is not troubled by this for two\nreasons. First, as long as one follows the rules governing the\n\\(\\delta\\) function (such as using the \\(\\delta\\) function only under\nan integral sign, meaning in part not asking the value of a \\(\\delta\\)\nfunction at a given point), then no inconsistencies will arise.\nSecond, the \\(\\delta\\) function can be eliminated, meaning that it can\nbe replaced with a well-defined mathematical expression. However, the\ndrawback in that case is, according to Dirac, that the substitution\nleads to a more cumbersome expression that obscures the argument. In\nshort, when pragmatics and rigor lead to the same conclusion,\npragmatics trumps rigor due to the resulting simplicity, efficiency,\nand increase in understanding.\n\nAs in the case of the notion of an infinitesimal, the Dirac \\(\\delta\\)\nfunction was eventually given a mathematically rigorous foundation.\nThat was done within Schwartz\u2019s theory of distributions, which\nwas later used in developing the notion of a rigged Hilbert space. The\ntheory of distributions was used to provide a mathematical framework\nfor quantum field theory (Wightman 1964). The rigged Hilbert space was\nused to do so for quantum mechanics (B\u00f6hm 1966) and then for\nquantum field theory (Bogoluliubov et al. 1975).\n\nThe complementary approaches, rigor and pragmatics, which are\nexhibited in the development of quantum mechanics, later came about in\na more striking way in connection with the development of quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) and, more generally, quantum field theory (QFT).\nThe emphasis on rigor emerges in connection with two frameworks,\nalgebraic QFT and Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. Algebraic QFT has\nits roots in the work of von Neumann on operator algebras, which was\ndeveloped by him in an attempt to generalize the Hilbert space\nframework. Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT has its roots in\nSchwartz\u2019s theory of distributions, and it was later developed\nin the rigged Hilbert space framework. Roughly, the basic distinction\nbetween the two approaches is that the algebra of operators is the\nbasic mathematical concept in algebraic QFT, while operator-valued\ndistributions (the quantum analogues of field quantities) are\nfundamental in Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. It is worth noting that\nalgebraic QFT is generally formulated axiomatically, and that it is\njust as deserving of the name \u201caxiomatic\u201d QFT. However,\nthat term is often taken to refer specifically to the approach based\non operator-valued distributions. To avoid any possible confusion,\nthat approach is referred to here as \u201cWightman\u2019s\naxiomatic\u201d QFT. The emphasis on pragmatics arises most notably\nin Lagrangian QFT, which uses perturbation theory, path integrals, and\nrenormalization techniques. Although some elements of the theory were\neventually placed on a firmer mathematical foundation, there are still\nserious questions about its being a fully rigorous approach on a par\nwith algebraic and Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. Nevertheless, it\nhas been spectacularly successful in providing numerical results that\nare exceptionally accurate with respect to experimentally determined\nquantities, and in making possible expedient calculations that are\nunrivaled by other approaches.\n\nThe two approaches to QFT continue to develop in parallel. Fleming\n(2002, pp. 135\u2013136) brings this into focus in his discussion of\ndifferences between Haag\u2019s Local Quantum Physics (1996)\nand Weinberg\u2019s Quantum Field Theory (1995);\nHaag\u2019s book presents algebraic QFT, and Weinberg\u2019s book\npresents Lagrangian QFT. While both books are ostensibly about the\nsame subject, Haag gives a precise formulation of QFT and its\nmathematical structure, but does not provide any techniques for\nconnecting with experimentally determined quantities, such as\nscattering cross sections. Weinberg gives a pragmatic formulation that\nengages with physical intuition and provides heuristics that are\nimportant for performing calculations; however, it is not as\nmathematically rigorous. Moreover, there are a number of important\ntopics that are examined in one book while not even mentioned in the\nother. For example, unitarily inequivalent representations are\ndiscussed by Haag, but not by Weinberg. By contrast, Weinberg\ndiscusses Feynman\u2019s rules for path integrals, which are not\nmentioned at all by Haag. There is also the issue of demographics.\nMost particle and experimental physicists will read and study\nWeinberg\u2019s book, but very few will read Haag\u2019s book.\nBecause of these differences, Fleming (2002, p. 136) suggests that one\nmight question whether the two books are really about the same\nsubject. This gives rise to the question whether any formulation of\nQFT is worthy of philosophical attention to its foundations. In\nparticular, there is a debate between Wallace (2006, 2011) and Fraser\n(2009, 2011) over whether an interpretation of QFT should be based on\nthe standard textbook treatment of QFT or an axiomatic formulation of\nQFT.\n",
