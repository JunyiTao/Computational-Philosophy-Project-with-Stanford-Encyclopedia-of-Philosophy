    "main_text": "Morals, Motives, and Reasons\n6. Morals, Motives, and Reasons\n\nAmong morality\u2019s distinctive features, all agree, is its\napparently intimate connection to action. In making moral judgments,\nfor instance, we seem to be making a claim that, if true, establishes\nthat someone or other has a reason to act or be a certain way. This\nmarks an important difference between moral claims and claims\nconcerning, say, color. The claim that something is red is, even if\ntrue, only contingently connected to whether anyone has any reason at\nall to act or be a certain way. Whereas if a certain thing is morally\ngood it seems that everyone necessarily has at least some reason\n(perhaps overridable or defeasible, but still some reason) to promote,\npursue, protect, or respect it\u2014at least if they recognize that\nit is good. Moreover, many have thought, to judge sincerely that\nsomething is good (whether or not one is right) is to have some\nmotivation (again, perhaps overridable or defeasible, but still some\nmotivation) to promote, pursue, protect, or respect it.\n\nThus there seem to be necessary connections between moral properties\nand reasons and also between moral judgments and motivations. Some\nhave thought as well that there is a necessary connection between\nmoral judgments and reasons, such that if one judges that something is\ngood or right then (whether one is correct or not) one had a reason to\nact or be a certain way. Others have thought that there is a\nconnection, again, a necessary connection, between there being a\nreason for someone to act or be a certain way and that person being,\nor at least being able to be, motivated in a certain\n way.[14]\n This last suggestion, that (say) one can have reason to do only what\none might be motivated to do, has implications as well for what might\ncount as good, if something is good only if one has a reason to act in\na certain way with respect to\n it.[15]\n\nEach of these supposed necessary connections is controversial and yet\neach has plausibly been taken to be at the heart of what is\ndistinctive about\n morality.[16]\n At the same time, different proposed connections fit more or less\nwell with different accounts of morality and at least some of the\nsupposed connections are flat out incompatible with some of the\naccounts. Thus those versions of non-cognitivism that see making a\nmoral judgment as a matter of expressing some motivating attitude have\nan easier time explaining the internal connection (if there is one)\nbetween sincerely making a moral judgment and having an appropriate\nmotive, while certain naturalist cognitivist proposals, for instance\nthose that identify goodness with having the capacity to garner\napproval from someone who is fully informed, must hold that a person\nmight sincerely judge that something would secure that approval and\nyet be utterly unmotivated by that\n fact.[17]\n (See the entries on\n moral motivation\n and\n reasons for action: internal vs external.)\n\nWorking through the ways in which a proper appreciation of the\nrelations between morality, reasons, and motivation constrain and\ninform an account of morality has been a central issue in metaethics.\nIn fact, Glaucon\u2019s original proposal concerning the nature of\nmorality (according to which morality is a conventional solution to\nproblems we would otherwise have to face) was introduced as a way of\npressing a worry about morality: Morality pretends to provide reason\nto all, virtue is supposed to be its own reward, and a person is told\nshe should do the right thing because it is right and not because she\nhopes for some reward, yet, in the face of the demands morality\nsometimes makes, these claims concerning its nature and value all seem\ndubious. Specifically, if morality is (as Glaucon\u2019s proposal\nwould have it) constituted solely by a set of conventional rules we\nput in place to secure the benefits we receive from the restraint of\nothers, it looks as if the only reason (and the only motive) we would\neach have for conforming to the rules would be found in the\nconsequences we hope such compliance would secure. In cases where we\ncould get the benefits without the restraint (as when our failure to\nrestrain ourselves would be undetected) we would have neither reason\nnor motive not to violate the rules. Thus, if Glaucon is right about\nthe nature of morality, then morality (properly understood) would only\nprovide reason to some, under some circumstances, not reason to all,\nalways. Moreover, virtue would not be its own reward. And morality\nwould not be such that it would make sense for a person to do the\nright thing (as defined by the rules in place) for its own sake, since\nthe sole value of the relevant rules is found in the benefits that\ncome from others complying with those rules.\n\nGlaucon\u2019s ultimate hope was Socrates would provide an account of\nmorality that\u2014unlike his own\u2014would serve to vindicate\nmorality\u2019s pretensions. Glaucon assumed that if no such account\nis forthcoming morality\u2019s claim on our allegiance is undermined,\neven as we might continue to have our own reasons for perpetuating the\nmyth and for working to see that others comply with its rules. Much of\nthe Republic is then given over to Socrates\u2019 first,\ndeveloping an account of the nature of morality (specifically, of\njustice) and then, second, arguing that being moral is valuable\nregardless of the consequences. Socrates\u2019 concern, in showing\nthat being moral is valuable, is to show specifically that it is\nvaluable to the person who is moral, that the virtuous person, and not\njust others, benefits from her virtue. Indeed, he tries to show that\nbeing moral is so valuable to the person who is moral, that whatever\nthe consequences of injustice might be, however great the rewards,\nthey could never be valuable enough to outweigh the loss of\none\u2019s virtue.\n\nSocrates\u2019 own account of the metaphysical and epistemological\nunderpinnings of his view (his appeal to eternal, non-physical\nPlatonic Forms and to our intellectual access to those Forms) commits\nhim unmistakably to non-naturalism and to something like intuitionism.\nYet his account of the nature of justice (as a matter of people\nsuccessfully being ruled by reason) and the specific features of\njustice that he takes to establish its value (specifically its\nconnection to freedom), are as available to a naturalist as to a\nnon-naturalist (as long as reason and freedom can be understood\nnaturalistically).\n\nIn any case, the question underlying Glaucon\u2019s concern\nis\u2014Why should I be moral?\u2014has consistently been at the\ncenter of attempts to explain the connection between morality and what\nwe have reason to\n do.[18]\n Some have argued that the question is misplaced, at least if it\nassumes there must be some non-moral reason to be moral. Others have\nheld that the question is easily answered on the grounds that the fact\nthat some action is morally required, for instance, entails that one\nhas reason to do it. And still others have maintained that the\nquestion presses the single most important challenge to\nmorality\u2019s legitimacy, since morality\u2019s claim on our\nallegiance depends on our having reason to comply with its demands,\nyet explaining why we might have those reasons is extraordinarily\ndifficult.\n\nWhatever view one ends up adopting concerning the connections that\nhold (or do not hold) among moral properties, moral judgments, reasons\nfor action, and effective motivations, no account is plausible as a\nvindication of morality unless it makes sense of how and why moral\nconsiderations might properly figure in practical deliberation that\nresults in decision and action. Doing this successfully is, in\nprinciple, compatible with thinking moral properties do not always\nprovide reasons, compatible too with holding that moral judgments\nsometimes fail to motivate, and, finally, compatible as well with the\nidea that one might have a reason to perform some action that one has\nno motivation to perform. Of course, these various views are each\nquite controversial and involve rejecting what others have thought to\nbe necessary truths.\n",
