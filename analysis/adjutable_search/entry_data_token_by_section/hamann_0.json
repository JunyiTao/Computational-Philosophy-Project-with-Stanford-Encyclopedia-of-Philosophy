    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nJohann Georg Hamann was born in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1730, the son of a\nmidwife and a barber-surgeon. He began study in philosophy and\ntheology at the age of 16, changed to law but mainly read literature,\nphilology, and rhetoric, but also mathematics and science. He left\nuniversity without completing his studies and became the governor to a\nwealthy family on a Baltic estate. During this time he continued his\nextraordinarily broad reading and private research. He took up a job\nin the family firm of a friend from his K\u00f6nigsberg days,\nChristoph Berens, and was sent on an obscure mission to London, in\nwhich he evidently failed. He then led a high life until he ran out of\nfriends, money and support. In a garret, depressed and impoverished,\nhe read the Bible cover to cover and experienced a religious\nconversion.\n\nHe returned to the House of Berens in Riga, where they evidently\nforgave him his failure. He fell in love with Christoph Berens\u2019\nsister, Katharina, but was refused permission to marry her by his\nfriend, on the grounds of his religious conversion; Berens was an\nenthusiastic follower of the Enlightenment and was nauseated by the\nmore pious manifestations of Hamann\u2019s new-found religiosity.\nSmarting from this blow and its motivations, Hamann returned to his\nfather\u2019s house in K\u00f6nigsberg, where he lived for the rest\nof his life until his final months.\n\nIn K\u00f6nigsberg, he never held an official academic post, nor an\necclesiastical one; this may in part have been due to his pronounced\nspeech impediment, which inhibited him from either lecturing or\npreaching. Eventually, through the intercession of his acquaintance,\nImmanuel Kant, he found employment as a low-level civil servant\nworking in the tax office of Frederick the Great; a ruler Hamann in\nfact despised. Nevertheless his principal activity was as an editor\nand a writer; he was considered one of the most widely-read scholars\nof his time (greatly aided by his fluency in many languages), as well\nas a notorious author. During this time, despite his committed\nChristianity, he lived with a woman whom he never married but to whom\nhe remained devoted and faithful, having four children on whom he\ndoted, and who occasionally feature in his writings (principally as\nunruly distractions to the author\u2019s scholarship).\n\nAt the end of his life he accepted an invitation to M\u00fcnster from\none of his admirers, Princess Gallitzin. He died in M\u00fcnster in\n1788.\n\nHamann had a profound influence on the German \u2018Storm and\nStress\u2019 movement, and on other contemporaries such as Herder and\nJacobi; he impressed Hegel and Goethe (who called him the brightest\nhead of his time) and was a major influence on Kierkegaard. His\ninfluence continued on twentieth century German thinkers, particularly\nthose interested in language. His popularity has increased\ndramatically in the last few decades amongst philosophers,\ntheologians, and German studies scholars around the world.\n",
