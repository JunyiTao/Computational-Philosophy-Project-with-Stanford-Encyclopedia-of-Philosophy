    "main_text": "Conceptual Themes in Feminist Philosophy of Biology || Determinism\n4.1 Determinism\n\n\nAs previously stated, biological or genetic determinism is the view\nthat individual, low-level and often genetic factors are the primary\ncauses of biological phenomena. Feminists are concerned with\ndeterminism because it has been used to argue that political change is\nfutile because sex and gender at the individual and social level are\ncaused by a static, biological human nature. Feminists have\ncriticized biological or genetic determinism in a number of biological\ndisciplines. Within genetics and molecular biology researchers\nsuch as Evelyn Fox Keller (2000), Bonnie Spanier (1995) Ruth Hubbard\n(1990) and Anne Fausto-Sterling (1992) have pointed out the logical and\nempirical distance between an organism having a particular genotype and\nexpressing a particular phenotype, including behaviors. Non-feminist\nphilosophers of biology have also developed criticisms of biological\ndeterminism (an influential example is Richard Lewontin's book\nBiology as Ideology 1992).\n\n\nFor example, the causal relationship between genes and the\nparticular proteins that result in phenotypes is called the Central\nDogma. According to the Central Dogma, information flows from DNA to\nRNA to protein, and not in the other direction. DNA\nspecifies messenger RNA in a process called transcription.\nMessenger RNA plays a role in specifying the amino acid sequence of a\nprotein which is the fundamental structure of an organism's\nphenotype. Feminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology,\nalong with many biologists, have pointed out that this causal chain is\nextremely complicated and that a particular genotype can result in\ndifferent phenotypes in different contexts. There are gene regulation\nmechanisms that turn genes on and off, and control the rate of\ntranscription. There are hereditary mechanisms whereby once a\nportion of DNA is rendered inactive in a cell it remains inactive in\nall of that cell's descendents. The cellular environment\naffects what DNA is transcribed and the fate of particular DNA\ntranscripts. A sequence of DNA does not uniquely specify a\nparticular protein. The machinery of the cell processes the RNA\ntranscript. During this processing different portions of an RNA\nstrand can be spliced out resulting in a different end products, which\nmeans that same DNA sequence can result in different proteins and\ndifferent phenotypic traits. The nature of the relationship\nbetween a sequence of DNA and the traits of an organism is\ncomplicated. Although genes make a difference in an\norganism's phenotype, they are not the sole causes determining\nthat phenotype. Simple pictures of genetic determinism are not\nsupported by molecular biology.\n\n\nFeminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology have made it clear\nthat even if a trait is the result of evolution by natural selection,\nor in other words is an adaptation, it does not follow that the trait\nis uniformly expressed in a population or static in an individual over\ntime. Some adaptive traits are almost always present and others\nrequire very specific environmental conditions in order to\ndevelop. One could have the genetic correlate of a trait and that\ntrait could be the result of natural selection, and yet changing the\nenvironment could eliminate the expression of that trait. Some traits\nare adaptations to past environmental conditions and are not beneficial\nto organisms in current conditions. Some traits are present and\nvery beneficial, and yet are not the result of natural selection and\nhence are not adaptations. Simple pictures of biological determinism\nare thus not supported by evolutionary biology (for example see Keller\n2000).\n\n\nAnother aspect of biology that has been used to support determinist\narguments involves differences in male and female brains, and the\neffects of sex hormones on the expression of behavioral traits.\nFeminist responses in these areas primarily consist of careful analysis\nof studies used to support these determinist arguments. For\nexample, Bleier (1984) points out the futility of separating nature\nfrom nurture, or in other words the structural and hormonal aspects of\nbrain development, from social learning and environmental influences on\nbrain development. She points out that the fetal and postnatal\ndevelopment of the brain is highly influenced by environmental inputs,\nthe human brain exhibits high levels of developmental plasticity, is\nsensitive to experience, and finally that humans are very good at\nlearning. It is very difficult to determine whether or not\nsexually dichotomized behaviors, which may be correlated with genetic,\nhormonal or brain differences, are fixed or changeable.\n\n\nFeminist philosophers of biology, such as Bleier (1984) and\nFausto-Sterling (1992), reveal a series of problems with studies that\npurport to find sex differences in brain anatomy, brain lateralization,\nand hormones that are correlated with gender differences in behavioral\ntraits and abilities. These critiques include pointing out that\n(1) for most of the behavioral traits in question there is more overlap\nthan difference among populations of men and women, (2) these studies\nare often based on limited data and insufficient sample sizes, (3)\nthese studies often involve unwarranted extrapolation from rodent\nmodels to humans, (4) there are problems with the biological conversion\nof androgens to estrogens in the body that make it difficult to\ninterpret in vivo experiments, and finally (5) there is also a\ntendency to discount social causes of putative differences between the\nsexes (see also Fehr 2004).\n",
