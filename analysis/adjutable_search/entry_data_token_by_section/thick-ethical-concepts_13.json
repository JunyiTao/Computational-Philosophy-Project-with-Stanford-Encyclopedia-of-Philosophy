    "main_text": "The Delineation Question: How Do Thick and Thin Concepts Differ? || Thick and Thin Differ in Degree\n5.2 Thick and Thin Differ in Degree\n\nThe second view about the relationship between thick and thin is that\nthey differ only in degree, not in kind. Samuel Scheffler suggests\nthis view in objecting to Bernard Williams\u2019s claim that thick\nand thin differ in kind. He observes that there are many evaluative\nterms that are hard to classify as either thick or thin, such as\njust, fair, impartial, rights,\nautonomy, well-being, and consent. They are\nless rich in non-evaluative content than terms such as cruel\nor tactful, although richer than good or\nright. But if descriptive thickness is a matter of degree,\nthen perhaps a binary division of evaluative concepts into thick and\nthin is an \u201coversimplification\u201d (Scheffler 1987:\n417\u20138). We might instead think of the distinction in terms of a\ncontinuum of descriptive thickness or specificity, where\nScheffler\u2019s examples lie between paradigmatic thick and thin\nterms. On the thin end we might either allow that some thin terms are\npurely evaluative and treat them as a limiting case, or we might hold\nthat even the maximally thin concepts are a little bit thick. Those\nholding the latter view have advocated either Thin Centralism (Smith\n2013) or Thick Centralism (Chappell 2013), but the latter view, unlike\nthe former, seems compatible also with the No Priority View.\n\nWhatever the merits of this view about how thick and thin differ only\nin degree, it doesn\u2019t follow simply from conceding that\nevaluative terms may be descriptively thick to varying degrees. This\nconcession allows a binary distinction between purely thin evaluative\nconcepts and thick evaluative concepts that are characterized by\nhaving some or other degree of non-evaluative content (cf. Dancy 2013:\n48\u20139). More definite conclusions about Scheffler\u2019s\nproposal would require reflection on whether his examples could\nplausibly belong to a separate third category of evaluative terms that\nare neither thick nor thin, and on whether a principled distinction\ncan be drawn between different kinds of non-evaluative content. In the\nlatter case a paradigmatic thin term such as ought might be a\nlittle bit thick if it implied can, and yet lack a kind of\nnon-evaluative content that is possessed only by thick terms proper.\nPerhaps, for instance, the non-evaluative aspects of tactful\nand cruel distinguish their meanings from other evaluative\nterms in a way that can doesn\u2019t do with\nought.\n\nIf thin terms are evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, then any\nversion of the difference-in-degree view requires that the Semantic\nView is true of thick terms. It fits with Pragmatic Views only if\nthese take thick and thin terms both to be related to the evaluations\nthey convey in the same way (whether as a matter of presupposition,\nimplicature, or some kind of not-at-issue content). Either way it will\nbe a further question whether the view is best combined with Thin\nCentralism, Thick Centralism, No Priority View or Non-Centralism.\nAgain the question whether thick and thin differ in degree or in kind\nhas no theory-neutral answer but depends on the correct substantive\ntheory of thick terms and concepts.\n\nA final proposal we\u2019ll consider can be developed either as\nsaying that thick and thin terms differ in kind or that they differ in\ndegree. R.M. Hare denies that thin terms are purely evaluative; actual\nusages of thin terms like good will always carry some\ndescriptive meaning. Instead, thick and thin terms both incorporate\nevaluative and non-evaluative information. The difference is that thin\nterms have their evaluative meaning \u201cmore firmly attached\u201d\nto them than their non-evaluative meaning, whereas thick terms have\ntheir non-evaluative meaning \u201cmore firmly attached\u201d to\nthem than their evaluative meaning (Hare 1963: 24\u201325; see also\nthe distinction between primarily and secondarily evaluative words in\nHare 1952: 121\u20132). The idea is that evaluative terms can be\ndistinguished in terms of which sort of meaning is less likely to\nchange when speakers alter their usage of a term. If\nlaissez-faire capitalists begin to use selfish\npositively, we are much more likely to still understand them than if\nthey started using selfish to describe generous acts. We\nwould be less likely to be accused of misusing kind and\ngenerous if we began to use them negatively to condemn\nbleeding hearts than if we started using them to describe cruel and\nselfish acts. Hare takes this to suggest that the non-evaluative\nmeanings of thick terms are more firmly attached to them than their\nevaluative meanings. Thin terms display the opposite behavior. We will\nunderstand those who use good to evaluate promise-breaking,\ntorture, and enslavement of their enemies positively, whereas we would\nbe liable to be misunderstood or accused of misusing the word if we\nstarted using good to express negative evaluations of helping\nand respecting others. Such descriptive ossification of thin terms,\nwhile not impossible, would seem very much like an exception rather\nthan the rule. (Hare 1952: 123 notes that a good effluent\nfunctions as a descriptive technical term in sewage disposal manuals.)\nSo the evaluative meanings of thin terms (in particular, their\naction-guiding function) seem to be more firmly attached to them than\ntheir non-evaluative meanings.\n\nHare\u2019s proposal seems quite ecumenical. If you worry that the\ntalk of evaluative and non-evaluative meanings suggests that\nHare\u2019s proposal is committed to Separability, note that it can\nbe reformulated as follows: thick and thin terms are typically used to\nperform two kinds of speech acts, describing and evaluating, and they\ndiffer with respect to how likely a speaker is to be misunderstood or\naccused of misusing the term if one or the other of these speech acts\nis changed. For instance, a speaker who uses selfish to\nevaluate positively acts which we typically describe as selfish would\nbe more likely to be understood than a speaker who uses\nselfish to describe generous acts and evaluate them\nnegatively, whereas the opposite pattern holds for thin terms. This\nversion of the proposal seems compatible with Inseparability. Nor does\nthe proposal entail the Semantic View. Instead of taking evaluative\nand non-evaluative meanings both to be semantic meanings, the less\nfirmly attached meaning can be taken as a speaker meaning instead. One\nway to interpret Hare\u2019s distinction between primarily and\nsecondarily evaluative words is that the latter carry evaluation only\nas a speaker meaning whereas the former carry non-evaluative\ndescription only as a speaker meaning (Hare 1952: 121\u20134). The\nPragmatic View is well suited to treating the evaluations normally\nconveyed by T-utterances as speaker meanings, especially if they are\nbest explained by conversational mechanisms. Here we can finally ask\nwhether Hare\u2019s proposal makes thick and thin different in kind\nor degree. You might think the latter: how firmly two things are\nattached is a matter of degree. However, the distinction between\nsemantic and speaker meaning makes a difference-in-kind reading\navailable. If the non-evaluative meanings of thick terms are semantic\nmeanings and their evaluative meanings are speaker meanings but thin\nterms work the other way around, then Hare\u2019s proposal regarding\nwhat kind of meanings thick and thin terms are more firmly attached to\nwould be a difference in kind.\n\nFor a summary of how thick terms and concepts relate to a further sort\nof evaluative terms, pejoratives, see\n section 4\n of the supplementary document\n \u201cAdditional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance\u201d.\n",
