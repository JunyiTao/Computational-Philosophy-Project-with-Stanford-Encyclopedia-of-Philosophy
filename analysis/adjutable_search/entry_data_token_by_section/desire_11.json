Controversies Surrounding Desire\n\n\nBecause desires feature prominently in theories of mind, action,\nfree will, and morality (and more!), desires are enmeshed in far too\nmany controversies to enumerate them all here. Nonetheless, some\ncontroversies surrounding desires are worthy of special attention,\neither because they are controversies surrounding key features of\ndesire (the first three that follow) or because they are controversies\nthat illustrate the larger role of desires in philosophical theorizing,\nespecially ethical theorizing (the second three).\n",
