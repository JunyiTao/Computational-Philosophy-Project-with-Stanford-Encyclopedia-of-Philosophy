    "main_text": "Arguing For and Against Moral Anti-realism || Non-objectivism\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has not attempted to adjudicate the rich and noisy debate\nbetween the moral realist and moral anti-realist, but rather has\nattempted to clarify just what their debate is about. But even this\nmuch more modest task is doomed to lead to unsatisfactory results, for\nthere is much confusion\u2014perhaps a hopeless\nconfusion\u2014about how the terms of the debate should be drawn up.\nIt is entirely possible that when subjected to acute critical\nexamination, the traditional dialectic between the moral realist and\nthe moral anti-realist will crumble into a bunch of evocative\nmetaphors from which well-formed philosophical theses cannot be\nextracted. If this is true, it would not follow that metaethics is\nbankrupt; far from it\u2014it may be more accurate to think that\nmodern metaethics has prospered to such an extent that the old terms\nno longer fit its complex landscape.\n\nBut for present, at least, the terms \u201cmoral realist\u201d and\n\u201cmoral anti-realist\u201d seem firmly entrenched. With so much\nill-defined, however, it would seem close to pointless to conduct\nmetaethical debate under these terms. This latitude means\nthat the terms \u201cmoral realist\u201d and \u201cmoral\nanti-realist\u201d are free to be bandied with rhetorical\nforce\u2014more as badges of honor or terms of abuse (as the case may\nbe) than as useful descriptive labels. Rather like arguments over\nwhether some avant-garde gallery installation does or does not count\nas \u201cart,\u201d taxonomic bickering over whether a given\nphilosopher is or is not a \u201cmoral realist\u201d is an activity\nas tiresome as it is fruitless.\n\nJust as important as gaining a clear and distinct understanding of\nthese labels is gaining an appreciation of what of real consequence\nturns on the debate. This seems particularly pressing here because a\nnatural suspicion is that much of the opposition to moral anti-realism\ndevelops from a nebulous but nagging practical concern about what\nmight happen\u2014to individuals, to the community, to\nsocial order\u2014if moral anti-realism, in one guise or another,\nwere widely adopted. The embrace of moral anti-realism, it is assumed,\nwill have an insidious influence. This concern presupposes that most\nof the folk are already pretheoretically inclined toward\nmoral realism\u2014an assumption that was queried earlier. But even\nif it is true that most people are naive moral realists, the question\nof what would happen if they ceased to be so is an empirical matter,\nconcerning which neither optimism nor pessimism seems prima facie more\nwarranted than the other. As with the opposition to moral\nnon-objectivism, the more general opposition to moral anti-realism is\nfrequently based on an under-estimation of the resources available to\nthe anti-realist\u2014on an unexamined assumption that the silliest,\ncrudest, or most pernicious version will stand as a good\nrepresentative of a whole range of extremely varied and often\nsophisticated theories.\n",
