    "main_text": "Theodicy\n5. Theodicy\n\nThe presence of various evils in the world is problematic for anyone\nwho claims that this world was created by a God who has infinite\npower, knowledge and goodness. However, the problem is particularly\nacute for an occasionalist such as Malebranche who holds that God is\nthe only true cause of effects in nature. Malebranche offers a\ntheodicy that addresses the problem of evil by emphasizing that in the\n\u201corder of nature\u201d God acts for the most part through His\ngeneral will. In Nature et gr\u00e2ce, he starts by\nadmitting that God could have acted by particular volitions to prevent\nnatural evils such as malformed offspring (a fitting example given his\nown malformed spine), and thus could have produced a more perfect\nworld than He actually did create. In correspondence with Leibniz,\nMalebranche emphasizes this point in distinguishing his theodicy from\nLeibniz\u2019s (see Schmaltz 2010). However, Malebranche also claims\nthat God could have created a more perfect world only by departing\nfrom simple laws, thereby sacrificing the simplicity and uniformity of\naction that is a supreme mark of His wisdom. God produces the natural\nevils that follow from simple laws not because He wills those\nparticular effects, but because He wills a world that best reflects\nHis wisdom by possessing the most effects governed by the fewest\nlaws.\n\nIn his R\u00e9flexions on Malebranche\u2019s Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce, Arnauld objects to what he took to be the suggestion\nin his target text that God has concern only for general features of\nthe world and does not will the details of His effects. For Arnauld,\ndivine providence requires that God intend all of the particularities\nof the world He creates. In the recent Anglophone literature, there is\na debate over whether Arnauld\u2019s critique is based on a proper\ninterpretation of Malebranche. This debate was promoted by the claim\nin Nadler (1993) that when Malebranche says that God acts by means of\ngeneral laws or volitions, he means only that God has volitions in\naccord with general laws, and that his doctrine of God\u2019s\ncontinual creation in the Entretiens sur la\nm\u00e9taphysique in fact requires distinct volitions for\ndistinct effects (cf. the development of this interpretation in Pessin\n2001 and Stencil 2011). Other commentators have countered that Arnauld\nwas correct in thinking that Malebranche\u2019s claim in Nature\net gr\u00e2ce that God acts by relatively few general volitions\ninvolves a rejection of the position that He has volitions for each\nparticular effect. Some evidence for this view is provided by the fact\nthat Malebranche emphasizes that the laws themselves are\n\u201cefficacious,\u201d and that God employs relatively few\nvolitions in producing effects in the order of nature (see Black 1997,\nJolley 2002, and Schmaltz 2003).\n\nMalebranche insists that God\u2019s general will is operative not\nonly in the order of nature, but also in the \u201corder of\ngrace.\u201d However, he notes that the production of effects in the\nlatter order also involves human action that is free in the strong\nsense of not being determined by anything external to the agent. His\nappeal to this sort of freedom is in fact central to his solution to\nthe problem of moral evil, that is, the compatibility of sin with\nGod\u2019s goodness. According to Malebranche, God is not responsible\nfor sinful action since such action derives not from Him but from\nsinful agents. Arnauld objects that this solution is \u201cmore\npelagian than anything in Pelagius,\u201d and that one must side with\nAugustine, who declared Pelagianism a heresy. Malebranche responds\nthat he did not follow Pelagius in denying the importance of grace,\nand that Augustine himself had emphasized our freedom in action.\n\nMalebranche also holds that it is obvious by \u201cinner\nsensation\u201d that we are genuinely free. However, there is some\nquestion whether this introspective report is compatible with\nMalebranche\u2019s occasionalist claim that God is the only real\ncause. This question has generated considerable discussion in the\nrecent Anglophone literature (cf. Schmaltz 2005, Greenberg 2008 and\n2015, and Peppers-Bates 2009). Malebranche does allow that God alone\nis the cause of our inclination to love \u201cthe good in\ngeneral.\u201d However, he also insists that we are free to\n\u201cconsent\u201d to the stopping of that inclination at a\nparticular object other than God. Such consent results in an\n\u201cabsolute and intrinsic\u201d love of that object that is\nsinful given that this love is worthy only of God. The consent is free\nbecause one is always able to suspend consent and to search for\nobjects more worthy of our love.\n\nThere is the claim that Malebranche\u2019s account of consent\nremained essentially the same over the course of his philosophical\ncareer (see Kremer 2000, 206). However, there is some reason to think\nthat this account in fact was subject to significant development. In\nthe initial discussion of freedom in the Recherche, there is\nthe suggestion that consent consists in our\n\u201cdetermination\u201d of our natural inclination toward the good\nin general (Malebranche [OC], 1:46). However, this suggestion\nconflicts with the claim in the very same text that it is God who\ndirects our natural inclination toward particular objects prior to any\nfree act on our part. Indeed, in his later discussion of freedom in\n\u201cEclaircissement I,\u201d Malebranche held that our freedom\nconsists not in an active turning of our natural inclination, but\nrather in the inactivity of our resting with a particular good\n(Malebranche [OC], 3:548). This view is further developed in the\nTrait\u00e9 de morale, which in the case of free action\ndistinguishes between the force involved in the search for\ntruth and the libert\u00e9 that directs this search. Free\nacts of consent fall under the latter, whereas the former involves the\ndispositions of our free inclinations that God produces in us on the\noccasion of these acts (Malebranche [OC], 11:70). In contrast to his\nearlier suggestion that our free acts involve either a turning of our\nnatural inclination or an inactivity coupled with such an inclination,\nMalebranche\u2019s view here is that such acts are inactivities\ncoupled with a distinct sort of free inclination. There are different\nanswers to the question of whether this account serves to reconcile\nMalebranche\u2019s occasionalism with his claim that we have genuine\nfreedom of action; cf. Schmaltz (2005), which defends the coherence of\nMalebranche\u2019s final position on this issue (in line with the\nearlier view in Laporte 1951), and Greenberg (2015), which argues that\nthis position is not fully consistent.\n",
