Newtonian Stargazing: \u201cThe Splendor of a Single Universal Rule\u201d\nFor the next seven years, Kant\u2019s life would be quiet. He was now\nteaching children in the Baltic countryside. As a Hofmeister\n(private teacher), he educated the sons of Pastor Andersch, from 1748\nto 1751, in the French settlement Judtschen, half a day\u2019s walk from\nK\u00f6nigsberg. Next he taught the sons of Knight von H\u00fclsen at his\nArnsberg estate until about 1753, a two-day day ride from\nK\u00f6nigsberg. Finally he worked as a tutor for Count Keyserlingk until\n1754. This in Kant\u2019s life is marked by social engagements, dinners and\nconvivial living. During this time Kant\u2019s finances improved, which\nleft him more time to attend to his tutoring and his own research.\nWhen Kant left town, the main influence on his thought had been\nGeorg Bernhard Bilfinger[16]\n (1693\u20131750), Wolff\u2019s former\nassistant at Halle. Bilfinger\u2019s heuristic method had inspired the\nproject of Living Forces.  This rule for finding truth is to\nidentify an intermediate position when experts advance contrary\nviews, provided ulterior motives are absent\n(1:32.7\u201313). Bilfinger\u2019s rule had guided Kant to reconcile\nLeibniz and Descartes over force. This method was to characterize\nnearly all of his critical writings as well.\nIn the countryside, Kant realized that his debut had met with no\nsuccess, despite its inspiration. His middle way of synthesizing\nLeibniz and Descartes was ignored. Having criticized Newton, Kant now\nreconsidered his stance on Newtonian physics. When Kant published his\nsecond work, the Spin-Cycle essay (1754), his misgivings had\nturned into admiration. As its title states, it is an\n\ninvestigation of the question whether the earth in its axial\nrotation, whereby it causes the change of day and night, has\nexperienced any change since the earliest times of its origin, and how\none could answer this question, announced for the current year\u2019s\nprize, by the Royal Academy of Sciences in\nBerlin. (1:183.1\u201312)\nKant describes gravitational attraction there as \u201cnature\u2019s\nuniversal engine\u201d (das allgemeine Triebwerk der Natur),\nwhich allowed Newton to reveal the secrets of nature in a manner that\nis \u201cas clear as it is indubitable\u201d (1:186.35\u20137). In\nthe essay, he also announces his next book (1755) with the working\ntitle,\n Cosmogony, or attempt to deduce the origin of the\ncosmos, the constitution of celestial bodies, and the causes of their\nmotions, from the general laws of motion of matter according to\nNewton\u2019s theory. (1:191.4\u20138)\nKant\u2019s Newtonian conversion would be completed while working on\nthe Spin-Cycle essay. The early drafts still involve\ndiscussions of Huygens\u2019s dynamics (23:5\u20137). But published\nargument is sharpened to a Newtonian point\u2014no other natural\nphilosopher is even mentioned. Newton had become Kant\u2019s authority and\nhis sole scientific point of reference.\nLittle is known of Kant\u2019s actual conversion. Only start and\nfinish\u2014Living Forces and Spin-Cycle\u2014are\npresent. But it does not take much imagination to fill in the blanks.\nIn 1749, Kant promoted his book and waited for a reaction. When\nkeeping track of the relevant journals, it could not have escaped him\nthat Newton was the winner, nor that Leibnizian dynamics was on the\nwane and that support for Cartesian kinematics had all but\ncollapsed. Force was Newtonian force. Newtonian physics had become the\nnew paradigm of natural philosophy.\nBy his own account, Kant was not enthusiastic about his employment,\nbut he did not hate it either. Some of his charges affectionately\nstayed in touch and later sought him out in the city. He was on good\nterms with Andersch and H\u00fclsen, and the work for the Keyserlingks was\nthe start of lifelong friendships. So his tutoring responsibilities\nwere not too great a burden. Afterwards, he would churn out\npublications at breath-taking speed\u2014two tracts, one book, a\nMaster\u2019s thesis, and a dissertation; each of them on a different\ntopic, and all of them in little more than one year (from June 1754 to\nSeptember 1755). The timing suggests that he had written some of it\nalready in the countryside.\nThis means he had leisure. He taught, but also pursued his own\ninterests. Remarkable about his Newtonian conversion is not the change\nof heart, but the change in competence. His first publication, despite\nits brilliance, reveals his confusions over basic mechanics and a\nremedial grasp of the mathematics needed to understand Newton. His\nnext group of works displays a firm grasp of celestial mechanics and a\ngrowing appreciation of the Principia. Digesting its\ncontents, particularly in the given form (in fluxion instead of normal\ncalculus) could have taken months, if not years.\nThe context in which Kant found himself may have lent itself to a\nmore holistic engagement with Newton. Rural life is life in daylight.\nKant had to adapt to his employers and attended to his charges during\nthe day. Because his leisure would have been after dinner (sundown) or\nbefore breakfast (sunrise), he probably read the Principia at\nnight. Nights before the industrial revolution were different than\nthey are now. Nights were dark, and when there was neither clouds nor\na full moon, stars would blaze with intensity unfamiliar to us\ntoday. The starry skies must have been awe-inspiring. We can\nconjecture that Kant, studying the Principia, would\noccasionally step outside and look up. He was reading about celestial\nmechanics\u2014and then he would see it. Kant\u2019s subsequent\npublications reveal his exuberance about the stars and the laws they\ndisplay; just as they reveal his grasp of the planetary dance and his\nrecognition of Newton\u2019s achievement. Kant\u2019s employment in the\ncountryside can certainly be understood as a boon to his study of\nNewton.\nKant\u2019s earlier work had sensitized him to the dynamics of nature,\nand this would have made it all the easier to marvel over celestial\nmechanics while stargazing. Thinkers with a dynamic bent, from\nPythagoras to Kepler, listened to the music of the spheres. As\nKepler\u2019s Harmonice Mundi (1619) shows, the music of the\nspheres is not a poetic delusion but a heuristic\ndevice.[17] It\nturns one\u2019s attention on cosmic patterns, the harmonies and beats\nthat point to laws. As the Spin-Cycle essay illustrates,\nKant followed in the footsteps of such thinkers.  Listening to the\nmusic of the spheres would generate the astonishing discoveries of\nthe 1750s.\nOn the face of it, it seems inexplicable how Kant could apply\nNewton\u2019s theory of the tides to the fate of Earth\u2019s axial\nrotation. But in the Spin-Cycle essay (1754), Kant arrived at\nthe right result for the right reasons. Newton showed that the\nprimarily lunar gravity acts on ocean tides. This action, Kant argues,\nconstitutes a retarding moment on the Earth\u2019s surface (1:187); this\nretardation, he infers, slows down the Earth\u2019s rotation (1:188); and\nthe lunar brake only lets go, he concludes, when days are as long as\nlunar months (1:190). He found the solution despite multiple\nhandicaps: minimal data, unimpressive formal skills, and no\ninstruments.\nBut if the planet\u2019s rotational fate is modeled as music, the\nsolution will be loud and clear. The gravitational pulls beat out\ndifferent rhythms. Daily terrestrial rotation and monthly lunar\nrevolution are not in sync. The resonance of their two spheres rattles\nwith a noise\u2014drumming a syncopated beat, the lows and highs of\noceanic tides. This tidal noise distracts from the rotating\nrhythm. The tidal taps, every six hours, weaken the Earth\u2019s\nbeat. Syncopates are dissonant; they are mechanical wobbles, and they\nwill eventually cease.  Undermining the cosmic beat, the dynamic\nopposites slow the Earth\u2019s spin down until they dissolve in\nharmony. When, in the far future the Moon always shines over the same\nspot, the Earth will have found its rhythm, sans tidal\ncacophony, and be in sonic step with its celestial neighborhood, and\nthe rotation of the Earth will be slowed.  Thus Kant\u2019s astrophysical\nessay was possible.\nIn retrospect, Newton had clarified to Kant the force-space bond of\nthe Living Forces. In its new guise, the bond is so useful\nthat its implications go beyond the Earth-Moon system. Its pulse, the\npulls and pushes, is the rhythm of the cosmos. The lesson of\nthe Living Forces is that matter is energy, and that forces\nact and interact with space. Aristotle\u2019s entelechy reveals that an\ninitial dynamic push produces material order when put into\naction. This action involves Bilfinger\u2019s dialectical harmony of\nopposites, but it is Newton who reveals its actual and precise\nmechanics.\nCosmic action turns on gravitation, the reciprocal attraction of\nmasses. When drawn together, masses collide, crash, and are laterally\ndeflected. The angular momentum of deflections generates a\ncounterforce to centripetal gravitation\u2014centrifugal\nrepulsion. Applying Newton to the bond, in his second\nbook Universal Natural History and Theory of the Sky (1755),\nKant sees that the dynamics of force, its push and pull, are\nattraction and repulsion. Matter is then all you need, he says, and\nyou can start building a world (1:229.10\u201311).\nThis is far more radical\u2014and more consistent\u2014than\nNewton\u2019s approach. Gravity will not do the trick of world building.\nHowever, the cosmic harmony of dynamic opposites, attraction and\nrepulsion, can do the conceptual work, provided one assumes a random\ndistribution of particles. This proviso marks a step beyond\nthe Living Forces. There, in the first book, Kant had\nexplained space by the outward action of force, but had glossed over\nthe individuation of multiple dynamic presences, necessary for cosmic\nevolution. Here, in the second book, he assumes an initial material\nchaos and explains its growth into ordered complexity by the\ninteraction of forces.\nKant\u2019s two cosmological starting points\u2014dynamic stretch into\nthe void in the 1740s, and homogeneous material chaos in the\n1750s\u2014are not contradictory. The reflections in his first book\nbegin with the very beginning, with existence prior to extension. The\nreflections in his second book proceed from the next stage, existence\nin extension. Kant\u2019s initial cosmogony starts with force stretching\nout into a void, creating a field. His next theory begins with the\nextended field sedimenting into a scattering of particles. He does not\nreplace a dynamic by an atomistic theory, or switch from active forces\nto inert matter. Matter always remains the guise and result of\nenergetic interactions. As he would stress in his professorial thesis,\nthe Physical Monadology (1756), particles are force\nconcentrations, whose solidity is due to dynamic interplay.\nIn light of present knowledge, his reflections were largely\ncorrect, and the gap in his cosmic history\u2014the interval from\ndynamic extension to material particles\u2014remains subject to\ndebate today. Cosmologists are not unanimous on what happened in this\nperiod.  Nonetheless, they have substantiated that force came first\nand that material chaos followed next. The universe did start\ndynamically as a singularity, whose first outward-bound and energetic\naction\u2014the Big Bang\u2014wove a dimensional structure in its\nwake. The continuum (the disentangling of space and time) emerged\n10\u221251 years and the chaos (the formation of atomic\nnuclei) 10\u22125 years after the Big Bang\u2014followed\nby the creation of atoms, of stars, the Sun, and the Earth. Within the\nexpanding bubble of the Bang is the universe today.\nAs soon as material chaos is assumed, everything happens on its\nown.  Kant contends in the Universal Natural History that\nnature\u2019s flourishing toward well-ordered complexity is explicable\nthrough an \u201cessential striving\u201d (1:226.8\u201312). No\nNewtonian \u201chand of God\u201d needs to stave off perceived loss\nof motion (1:222\u2013225); he had already stated earlier that\nappealing to lost motion is a \u201cdesperate excuse\u201d\n(Living Forces #50; 1:59). As he explains now\u2014taking\nnothing back from the stance that cost him his graduation\u2014God\ndoes not function in nature\u2019s development because creation is\nself-organization. Fully convinced of this, he warns fundamentalists\nagainst opposing science; if they did, they would be defeated\n(1:222.32\u201335; 225.2\u20135).\nThe push and pull of the bond explains cosmic self-organization,\nand in the Universal Natural History Kant shows how the chaos\nevolved to the starry skies visible now. It should be possible to do\nthe same for organisms, but science at the time did not explain the\nformation of life. How life unfolds we do not know\n(1:230.14\u201320); we only know that it does. Kant believes (science\nagrees) that star birth is easier to determine than the creation of\nlife (1:230.20\u201326).\nWith his famous nebular hypothesis, Kant discerned how planets,\nstars, and galaxies form. Their birth is a process of titanic power.\nAttractive forces contract particles into clouds, but repulsive\nforces deflect them up close. Continued accretion increases\ndeflection, imparting angular momentum on the ever quicker rotating\ncloud. Rotation generates centrifugal forces, pulling the cloud\u2019s\nequators outwards, crushing the poles, until the out-bulging yet\nin-falling sphere, revolving ever faster around its center, flattens\ninto a disc. The bond, in Newton\u2019s model of universal gravitation,\ncontinues coalescing in momentum and spin, until the center of the\ncosmic disc is so energized that it combusts. Increased energy\ntranslates into increased structure, organizing the ecliptic plane\ninto lumpy coalescence. When the disc plane sediments into spinning\nbands, the lumps grow massive, while caroming along their orbits. The\nmoving masses vacuum their paths and grow into planets strung along\nan ecliptic plane, orbiting a sun in now empty space\u2014or, on a\nhigher order of magnitude, into suns majestically revolving around a\nbrightly lit galactic center. Whether suns in spiral galaxies, or\nplanets in solar systems, the orbiting satellites sweep out equal\nareas in equal times, with their periods in sync with their distances\nfrom the gravitational \ncenters.[18]\nWith this essay, Kant synthesize Newton with his own theory of\nforces, leading Kant to the cutting edge of current knowledge. Nature,\nin the Universal Natural History, streams outward in a\nwavefront of organization (1:314.1\u20132), generating worlds\n(1:314.8), biospheres and sentience (1:317.5\u201313, 352\u20133),\nand finally reason, human and otherwise (1:351\u201366). Organization\nis fragile, and spontaneity, pushed far enough, invites chaos. Mature\ncosmic regions decay, chaos sets in, and entropy follows in the wake\nof complexity. But entropy provides the very conditions that allow the\ncosmic pulse to bounce material points back to order. Thus the\nexpanding chaos coalesces at its center into order, followed by chaos,\nby order, by chaos. Like a rising and burning phoenix, nature cycles\nbetween life and death (1:312.13).\nFor creatures, the cosmic phoenix is a problem. Humans are just\nfeathers on its wings. Humans grow only to burn to ashes; they are not\nexempt from the cosmic law (1:318.17\u201318). As the pulsing cosmic\nvector governs everything, order emerges on all orders of magnitude,\nfrom the repetitive birth of the phoenix to the elements to life and\nto inevitable collapse\u2014only to begin anew again. The force-space\nbond unfolds in the interactive harmony of dynamic opposites, an\ninteraction governed by Newton\u2019s universal gravitation, churning out\ngalaxies, suns, planets, life, and minds. Thus, as Kant writes, a\n\u201csingle universal rule\u201d guides natural evolution in an\nabsolutely glorious way (1:306.18\u201323).\n",
