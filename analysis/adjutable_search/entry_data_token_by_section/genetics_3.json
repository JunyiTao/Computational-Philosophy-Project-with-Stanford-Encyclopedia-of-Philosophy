    "main_text": "The Science of Genetics || Genetics Goes Molecular\n1.3 Genetics Goes Molecular\n\nMorgan\u2019s fruit fly research proved that genes were on\nchromosomes. But by the 1950s it was still unclear what genes were\nmade up of, what their molecular structure was, and how that structure\nproduced the observable hereditary patterns found in nature.\nBiologists at the time debated whether the genetic material was\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or proteins; Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod,\nand Maclyn McCarty had previously indicated in research on mice that\nit was DNA, but this conclusion was by no means universally accepted\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty 1944). Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase at\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory ingeniously used viruses\u2014made up\nof a protein body (or \u201ccoat\u201d) and DNA inside\u2014that\ninfected bacteria to settle the matter (Hershey and Chase 1952). They\nfirst radioactively labeled the viruses\u2019 protein coat and\nallowed them to infect the bacteria, and then they radioactively\nlabeled the viruses\u2019 DNA and allowed them to infect the\nbacteria. The question was: When the viruses replicated in the\nbacteria, would the radioactive marker show up in the bacteria\ninfected by viruses with radioactively-labeled proteins or in the\nbacteria infected by viruses with radioactively-labeled DNA? It was\nthe latter, and that convinced molecular biologists that deciphering\nthe molecular structure of DNA was the next major challenge (entry:\n molecular biology).\n\nA number of geneticists, structural chemists, and physicists descended\non the structure of DNA in the 1950s (Olby 1994). It was James Watson\nand Francis Crick at the University of Cambridge who first determined\nthat DNA was a double-helix (Watson and Crick 1953). Utilizing\nWatson\u2019s genetic expertise, Crick\u2019s work in theoretical\nphysics, and Rosalind Franklin\u2019s x-ray crystallographic images\nof DNA (appallingly, without her consent or even knowledge), Watson\nand Crick built a model of DNA showing two polynucleotide strands\nspiraling around one another (de Chadarevian 2002; Maddox 2002). The\nstrands were made up of a sequence of nucleic acids\u2014combinations\nof adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), such that\nan adenine on one strand hydrogen-bonded with a thymine on the other\nand a cytosine on one strand hydrogen-bonded with a guanine on the\nother (entry:\n models in science).\n\nMolecular biologists spent the remainder of the 1950s and 1960s\ndetermining how the double-helical structure of DNA helped to\nelucidate the mechanisms of genetic replication and function. This\nresearch was guided by the notion that the gene was an informational\nmolecule (Kay 2000). The nucleic acid bases were \u201cletters\u201d\nwhich, in sets of three, made up \u201cwords\u201d that\n\u201ccoded\u201d for one amino acid. Each chromosome was a\n\u201cchapter\u201d in an organism\u2019s entire genome\u2014the\n\u201cbook of life\u201d. These weren\u2019t just catchy phrases\nfor newspaper headlines. The technical language of molecular biology\nemployed the information metaphor. DNA was \u201ctranscribed\u201d\ninto RNA, which was then \u201ctranslated\u201d into\nproteins\u2014the central dogma of molecular biology (entry:\n biological information).\n\nEvolutionary biology also followed this reductionistic trend down to\nmolecules. Molecular evolution emerged as a field of study where\nevolutionary changes were tracked at the level of DNA sequences, and\nDNA became thought of as a ledger of evolutionary history. Most\ngenetic mutations, it became clear, had little to no impact on an\norganism\u2019s fitness\u2014either because the mutation occurred in\nsuch a way that the same amino acid was produced anyway (a product of\nredundancy in the genetic code) or because the mutation occurred in a\nregion of the genome where no proteins were coded; this, in turn,\nforced biologists to rethink the extent to which DNA sequences could\nbe understood as the product of natural selection alone (Kimura 1968;\nDietrich 1994). Mutation rates in homologous DNA sequences shared by\ndifferent species (say, humans and chimpanzees) also allowed for\ninferring how far back those two species diverged from a common\nancestor (entries:\n ecological genetics;\n genetic drift).\n",
