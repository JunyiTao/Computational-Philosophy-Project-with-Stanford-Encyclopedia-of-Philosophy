Learning to\ncooperate involves learning to become a trading partner. In other\nwords, cooperation begins with having something to offer: a way of\nmaking people better off.\n\nClearly in Smith, who inspired Hayek, but also in Hayek himself, one\ninfers that the driving motivation is not greed or even well-being so\nmuch as a propensity to truck and barter, where this deal-making is\nnot only a means to an end but somehow also something we do for its\nown sake, because making deals is what our kind of social animal was\nborn to do. Neither, Hayek thought, is the objective for buyers and\nsellers to coordinate on a price that a central planner might\nstumble on, but to coordinate, period. Mutually satisfying\ncoordination, the ongoing equilibration of supply and demand,\nconstantly evolving in response to changing conditions, is itself the\nachievement. There is no need for that coordination to be tracking\nanything beyond itself. To Hayek, the value that we hope to see\nrealized in a marketplace is not so much that the correct volume of\ngoods gets exchanged at the correct price. Rather, the genesis and\npoint of the division of labor is not only a prospect of realizing\ngains from trade but trade per se. The valued result is buyers and\nsellers responding to each other, becoming more attuned to what people\naround them want, and helping to create a community in which their\nrole in an important one.\n\nSuch sensitivity is good, but there is little that central planners\ncan do to encourage it. Central planners replace what could be a\ncomplex, decentralized network of interdependence and mutual\nresponsibility with something more like a society of spokes tethered\nto a central distributor at the hub but otherwise dangling. It is no\nsubstitute for real community.\n",
