    "main_text": "The Condition Question || Structuralist Approaches\n4.6 Structuralist Approaches\n\nAnother idea about how to define the physical that has become\nprominent in recent times is a structuralist approach to the\nphysical.\n\nOne way to introduce the structuralist approach is to see it as a\ndevelopment of the theory conception formulated above. On the theory\nview, a property is physical just in case it is tied in the right way\nto a physical theory. One problem that arises for such a view, as we\nhave seen, is what \u2018physical theory\u2019 is supposed to mean\nhere. For the structuralist (at least in the context;\n\u2018structuralism\u2019 can mean many different things), a\nphysical theory is one that employs a restricted vocabulary. One\nparticularly frank version of this sort of view is suggested by\nRussell 1927; on this view, the vocabulary in question is restricted\nto logical or mathematical vocabulary. Contemporary philosophers adopt\na less restricted view according to which the vocabulary is either\nlogical or mathematical or causal or nomological (i.e. pertaining to\nlaws) or some combination of these (see Alter 2016, Chalmers 2020,\nGoff 2017; for criticism see Stoljar 2020). In effect, proposals like\nthis provide a topic-neutral conception of the physical, and hence a\ntopic-neutral conception of physicalism.\n\nAn attractive feature of this approach is that it provides an answer\nto Hempel\u2019s dilemma and similar problems. Physics may indeed\nchange over time, but according to the structuralist, any physical\ntheory must be restricted to this sort of vocabulary. Hence we can\nappeal to the notion of a physical theory to formulate a version of\nphysicalism on which everything supervenes on or is realised by or is\ngrounded in physical properties that can be expressed in that limited\nvocabulary. (Here structuralism about the physical draws support from\nstructural realism in philosophy of science, a position to which it is\nin some ways quite similar; see, e.g.\n Structural Realism)\n\nHowever, a problem for structuralism (developed in Stoljar 2020) is\nthat, while placing restrictions of this sort on the notion of a\nphysical theory helps with Hempel\u2019s dilemma, it also seems\noverly stringent. Physical theories on the face of it tell you lots of\nthings about the physical world which are not topic-neutral, for\nexample, about mass, energy, electrons, protons and a myriad other\nthings. The idea that we can capture all of this using a language that\nemploys only logical/mathematical or causal/nomic vocabulary\nmay seem an overly ambitious one. \n\nWhile there are problems with structuralist approaches to the\nphysical, as with the Via Negativa, there is also something right\nabout it. We have noted one idea in philosophy of science that is\nsimilar to the structuralist approach to the physical, namely,\nstructural realism. A different idea that philosophers of science have\nemphasised a lot in recent literature is that physicists and other\nscientists often construct mathematical models of the systems they are\ninterested in; moreover, they often focus on the mathematical\nproperties of these models themselves (see, e.g. Weisberg 2013).\nPerhaps a structuralist approach to such mathematical models is\nplausible. Nevertheless, structuralism about the physical is a thesis,\nnot about these mathematical models, but about the target systems that\nthese models correspond to, and it precisely this that causes the\nproblem.\n",
