    "main_text": "Problems and Prospects || The dream-skeptical problem: judgment, problematic idealism, and the gap in the Second Analogy\n4.4 Conclusion: judgment without strong transcendental idealism?\n\nAs we have seen in Sections 4.1 to 4.3, Kant\u2019s theory of\njudgment leads to at least three serious problems when it is taken in\nconjunction with the issue about his conceptualism vs. his\nnon-conceptualism (in the supplement\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism)\n and his metaphysics of strong transcendental idealism (Section 3.1\nand the supplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment).\n Does this mean his theory of judgment is philosophically unacceptable\nand at best an antiquarian curiosity of 18th century German\nphilosophy? No. This is because it seems very likely that the problems\nin Kant\u2019s theory of judgment are principally due to his\nconjoining the centrality thesis and the priority-of-the-proposition\nthesis with the thesis of transcendental idealism. But suppose that\nthe strongest version of transcendental idealism is false, and that\nthe transcendental idealism thesis is either logically detached from\nthe other two theses or else retained but instead based on a\nsignificantly weaker version of transcendental idealism (Hanna 2006b,\nch. 5): what remains? We are left with a general Kantian theory of\nhuman rationality that is essentially oriented towards judgment, and\nthen in turn with specific Kantian accounts of the nature of judgment\nand of the various irreducibly different kinds of judgment, that are\nessentially oriented towards the anthropocentric empirical\nmeaningfulness and truth of the proposition. As such, Kant\u2019s\ntheory of judgment is thoroughly cognitivist but also\nanti-psychologistic and anti-platonistic, and it thereby smoothly\ncombines the several \u201cfaces\u201d of judgment into a unified\ndoctrine. So the fact that Kantian non-conceptualism (see the\nsupplement\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism)\n makes serious trouble for the B Deduction (Section 4.1), together\nwith the further fact that the strongest version of transcendental\nidealism is very likely false\u2014since the unqualified\ntranscendental ideality thesis, when conjoined with the centrality\nthesis and the priority-of-the-proposition thesis, collectively entail\ncontradictions in Kant\u2019s theory that are not entailed by the\nconjunction of the other two theses alone\u2014do not ultimately\ncompromise the inherent philosophical interest, contemporary\nrelevance, and critical defensibility of the other basic parts of\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment.\n",
