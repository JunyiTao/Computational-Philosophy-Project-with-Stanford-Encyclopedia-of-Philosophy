    "main_text": "Reinhold\u2019s Life and Work\n1. Reinhold\u2019s Life and Work\n\nKarl Leonhard Reinhold was born in Vienna October 26, 1757 (though\nmany older sources erroneously give 1758 as his year of his birth). He\nstudied at the Jesuit Seminary in Vienna for a year, until the order\nwas suppressed in 1773, at which time he entered the Barnabite\nseminary. Following his ordination, he became a Barnabite monk and\nserved for several years as a parish priest and teacher of philosophy.\nReinhold\u2019s first publications were book reviews and short essays\nin popular newspapers, in which he showed himself to be a zealous\nadvocate of Josephite reforms and an enthusiastic exponent of radical\nEnlightenment and religious toleration.\n\nIn 1783 Reinhold moved to Leipzig and converted to Protestantism. He\nalso became a Freemason and a member of the Illuminati, and\nhe remained an active Freemason until the end of his life. Possessed\nof a restless, inquiring spirit, Reinhold\u2019s early intellectual\ntrajectory led him from orthodox Catholicism, to reformed Catholicism,\nto materialism and atheism, and then to Leibnizianism and to Humean\nskepticism. Yet he always remained true to the ideal of\n\u201cEnlightenment,\u201d at least as he understood that ideal, and\nhe never ceased to insist that philosophy ought to make a practical\ndifference in the world. For all of his forays into the most technical\nand arcane philosophical debates and issues, he never wavered in his\ninsistence that true \u201cpopularity\u201d must remain the goal of\nphilosophy, and that the ultimate test of any system is its capacity\nfor convincing everyone of its truth. Enlightenment, for Reinhold, was\nno abstract pursuit of truth, but a program of religious, moral,\nsocial, and political reform. Coupled with this commitment to\npopularity, was a pedagogic zeal to do everything in his power to\nspread the message of popular Enlightenment\u2014whether in its\nmaterialist, its neo-Leibnizian, its skeptical, its Kantian, its\nFichtean, its Bardilian, or its distinctively\n\u201cReinholdian\u201d form\u2014as widely and as effectively as\npossible.\n\nIn 1784, after studying philosophy for a semester in Leipzig, Reinhold\nmoved to Weimar, where he became a confidant (and son-in-law) of C. M.\nWieland and a regular contributor to Wieland\u2019s widely read\nDer Teutsche Merkur. It was in this journal that his famous\nseries of \u201cLetters on the Kantian Philosophy\u201d began to\nappear in 1786. It is with these \u201cLetters,\u201d which were\nsubsequently published in revised and expanded form in two volumes,\nthat Reinhold\u2019s name enters the history of philosophy. What\nReinhold found in Kant is clearly expressed in the first of his many\nprivate letters to the latter: namely, a way to resolve the\ndebilitating conflict between faith and reason,\n\u201csuperstition\u201d and \u201cdisbelief,\u201d\n\u201cheart\u201d and \u201chead.\u201d And this is precisely the\naspect of the new, Critical philosophy that is emphasized in his\nLetters on the Kantian Philosophy: not Kant\u2019s radical\nnew account of space and time, nor his audacious effort to provide a\ntranscendental deduction of the pure categories of the understanding,\nbut rather the conclusions and implications of the\n\u201ctranscendental dialectic.\u201d\n\nKantianism was recommended by Reinhold, above all, for its allegedly\nsalubrious and enlightened practical consequences,\nparticularly with respect to religion and morality. It was not for\nnothing that Reinhold described this new philosophy to readers of\nDie Teutscher Merkur as \u201cthe gospel of pure\nreason.\u201d Rational belief in God, in the immortality of the soul,\nin the reality of free will: such are the articles of this new\n\u201cgospel\u201d\u2014a gospel promulgated, everyone agreed, far\nmore effectively and popularly by Reinhold than by Kant himself. Even\nKant professed to be charmed by Reinhold\u2019s effort and gratified\nby his success.\n\nOn the strength of his newfound fame as author of the\nLetters, Reinhold was invited to be the inaugural occupant of\nthe first professorial chair devoted exclusively to the new Kantian\nphilosophy, and thus he began lecturing at the University of Jena in\n1787. First at Jena, and then later at the University of Kiel,\nReinhold proved to be an immensely popular and influential teacher,\nmuch beloved by his students. (Of the approximately 860 students\nenrolled in Jena in the Spring Semester of 1794, 600 were enrolled in\nReinhold\u2019s three lecture courses.) Indeed, Reinhold was largely\nresponsible for making Jena the center of German philosophy, which it\nremained for the next several decades.\n\nIn his published Letters on the Kantian Philosophy Reinhold\nhad excused himself from the task of presenting and examining the\ntheoretical foundations of Kant\u2019s Critical philosophy, in order\nto concentrate instead upon the practical consequences of the same.\nBut once he arrived at Jena he set himself to the former task, the\nsurprising result of which was not so much the popularization of\nanother aspect of Kant\u2019s thought as a first, historically\nmomentous effort to revise and recast the\ntheoretical foundations of the new transcendental idealism in a new,\nallegedly more coherent and systematic form. The fruit of this\nrevisionist effort was Reinhold\u2019s own \u201cElementary\nPhilosophy\u201d (see below), which, though only a passing phase in\nReinhold\u2019s own development as a philosopher, remains his most\nsubstantial and effective contribution to the historical development\nof German Idealism.\n\nReinhold\u2019s Elementary Philosophy is most fully expounded in\nthree works he published in rapid succession during his tenure at the\nUniversity of Jena: Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen\nVorstellungsverm\u00f6gens [Attempt a New Theory of the Human\nFaculty of Representation] (1789), Beytr\u00e4ge zur\nBerichtigung bisheriger Missverst\u00e4ndnisse der Philosophen,\nErster Band [Contributions toward Correcting the Previous\nMisunderstandings of Philosophers, Vol. I] (1790), and Ueber\ndas Fundament des philosophischen Wissens [On the Foundation\nof Philosophical Knowledge] (1791).\n\nReinhold\u2019s radical revision and implicit critique of orthodox\nKantianism exercised an immediate and immense influence upon his\ncontemporaries, and particularly upon the philosopher who followed him\nat Jena in 1794, namely Johann Gottlieb Fichte. But though Fichte was\nthoroughly convinced by Reinhold\u2019s arguments for the\nincompleteness of Kant\u2019s own presentation of the Critical\nphilosophy and by his demand for an immediately certain \u201cfirst\nprinciple\u201d of the same, he was not satisfied with\nReinhold\u2019s own efforts to satisfy these demands and, in the\nAenesidemus review and elsewhere, made public his own\ncriticisms of the Elementary Philosophy and of Reinhold\u2019s\n\u201cPrinciple of Consciousness.\u201d For a few years following\nFichte\u2019s arrival in Jena and Reinhold\u2019s transfer to Kiel,\nthe two men engaged in a wide-ranging and stimulating philosophical\ncorrespondence, though they never met.\n\nThe final upshot of Reinhold\u2019s Auseinandersetzung with\nFichte was the former\u2019s recantation of his own Elementary\nPhilosophy and transference of his allegiance to the standpoint of\nFichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre. This conversion was made\npublic in early 1797, in the preface to Reinhold\u2019s Auswahl\nVermischster Schriften, Zweyter Band [Selection of\nVarious Writings, Volume II] and in his revised 1795 Prize Essay,\nfeatured in that work. It was elaborated in a lengthy review essay in\nthe Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung of Fichte\u2019s recent\nwritings, and again, the following year, in Reinhold\u2019s Ueber\ndie Paradoxien der neuesten Philosophie [Concerning the\nParadoxes of the most recent Philosophy], in which he explicitly\nacknowledged the inadequacy of his own Principle of Consciousness as\nthe foundation of philosophy as a whole and endorsed Fichte\u2019s\nproposal for a more \u201cactive\u201d first principle (the\nTathandlung, or \u201cfact-act\u201d of the I\u2019s\nself-positing), which would be capable of fully integrating\ntheoretical with practical reason, as well as uniting theoretical and\npractical philosophy.\n\nAs his contribution to the Atheism Controversy of 1798/99, which led\nto Fichte\u2019s departure from Jena, Reinhold published a pamphlet\nin Fichte\u2019s defense. However, it was not long before he grew\ndissatisfied with what he perceived to be the\n\u201cone-sidedness\u201d of Fichte\u2019s philosophy\u2014and\nindeed, of transcendental idealism as a whole\u2014and publicly\nsought some \u201cthird way,\u201d which could reconcile the\nopposing positions of Fichte and Jacobi (whose contribution to the\nAtheism Controversy was an influential \u201cOpen letter,\u201d\ncriticizing philosophy in general and Fichte\u2019s transcendental\nidealism in particular as \u201cnihilism.\u201d) This effort on\nReinhold\u2019s part to mediate the differences between the\ntranscendental idealist \u201cphilosopher of freedom\u201d (Fichte)\nand the common-sense \u201cnon-philosopher of faith\u201d (Jacobi)\npleased neither party, and signaled the quick and abrupt end of\nReinhold\u2019s short-lived \u201cFichte phase.\u201d\n\nAfter resolutely turning his back on the new post-Kantian idealist\nphilosophy that he himself had done so much to instigate, Reinhold now\npresented himself to the public, in the six issues of his own\nBeytr\u00e4ge zur leichtern Uebersicht des Zustandes der\nPhilosophie beym Anfange des 19. Jahrhunderts [Contributions\nto a Simpler Overview of the State of Philosophy at the Beginning of\nthe Nineteenth Century] (1801\u20131803), as a partisan of C.G.\nBardili\u2019s \u201clogical realism,\u201d which Reinhold dubbed\n\u201crational realism.\u201d This system attempted to base\nphilosophy upon pure logic and upon an appeal to what Bardili called\n\u201cthinking qua thinking.\u201d It was this effort on\nReinhold\u2019s part, in the first issue of the\nBeytr\u00e4ge, \u201cto reduce philosophy to logic\u201d\nthat drew the sarcastic ire of Hegel in his notorious appendix to his\nDifferenz des Fichte\u2019schen und Schelling\u2019schen Systems\nder Philosophie [Difference between the Fichtean and\nSchellingian System of Philosophy] (1801).\n\nSoon enough, however, Reinhold became dissatisfied with\nBardili\u2019s position as well, and began publicly to criticize the\nsame \u201cfrom the standpoint of language\u201d and to reject all\nefforts to ground philosophy in pure formal logic. Reinhold\u2019s\nfinal project as a philosopher can be described as a pioneering effort\nto take seriously the implications of ordinary language for philosophy\nitself and to insist upon the intimate relationship between speaking\nand thinking. These writings of Reinhold\u2019s final years went\nnearly unnoticed during his own lifetime and have generally remained\nunknown until very recently; yet they would appear to merit the\nattention of contemporary philosophers and scholars, inasmuch as they\nanticipate in certain ways the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d of so\nmuch subsequent philosophy.\n\nAfter a lifetime of philosophical inquiry, during which he influenced\ncountless readers and students, while himself moving restlessly from\none theoretical standpoint to another, Reinhold died in Kiel in\n1823.\n",
