    "main_text": "Different Kinds of Organ Sale System\n1. Different Kinds of Organ Sale System\n\nThe expression \u2018organ sale\u2019 covers a wide range of\ndifferent practices.  People most readily associate it with the case\nin which one individual (who needs or wants money) sells his or her\nkidney to another (who needs a kidney).  But there are other\npossibilities too.  One (in countries where the prior consent of the\ndeceased is required for cadaveric organ donation) is to pay people\nliving now for rights over their body after death.  Another (in\ncountries where the consent of relatives is required for cadaveric\norgan donation) is to pay relatives for transplant rights over their\nrecently deceased loved ones' bodies.\n\n\nSince the kidney is the most commonly transplanted organ and since the\nethics literature on organ sale is mainly about kidney sale from live\ndonors, that is the practice on which this entry will focus.\n\u2018Organ sale\u2019 as the term is used here does not include the\nsale of body products (a category which includes blood, eggs,\nhair, and sperm) since this is different in some important respects.\nFor example, the risk of permanent harm is generally much less in the\ncase of blood and hair donation; while, the donation of eggs and sperm\nraises additional issues relating to the creation and parenting of\nadditional future people.  That said, many of the fundamental issues\nare similar and the very same concerns about (for example)\nexploitation and consent arise in both cases.\n\n\nAn important preliminary point is that almost all serious advocates of\nallowing payment for human organs argue not for an unfettered\n\u2018free market\u2019 but for a regulated one.  Radcliffe Richards\net al. (1998, 1950) for example, in their paper \u201cThe Case for\nAllowing Kidney Sales\u201d say:\n\n\n\nIt must be stressed that we are not arguing for the positive conclusion\nthat organ sales must always be acceptable, let alone that there should\nbe an unfettered market.\n\n\nWhile Wilkinson (2003, 132) is typical of organ sale defenders in\nwishing to distance himself from today's (largely\n\u2018underground\u2019) organ trade:\n\n\n\n\u2026 far from being a reason to continue the ban on sale, the\ndreadfulness of present practice may be a reason\nto discontinue prohibition, so that the organ trade can be\nbrought \u2018overground\u2019 and properly regulated.\n\n\n\nDifferent scholars have different views about the precise scope and\nextent of the regulation required, but most support the requirements\nthat organ sellers give valid consent, are paid a reasonable fee, and\nare provided with adequate medical care.  Taylor (2005, 110) for\nexample, says that:\n\n\n\nAt minimum \u2026 a market should require that vendors give their\ninformed consent to the sale of their kidneys, that they not be\ncoerced into selling their kidneys by a third party and that they\nreceive adequate post-operative care.\n\n\n\nOne noteworthy policy proposal comes from Erin and Harris (1994; 2003)\nwho suggest that a market in human organs should have the following\nfeatures:\n\n\n\nIt is limited to a particular geopolitical area, such as a state or\nthe European Union, with only citizens or residents of that area being\nallowed to sell or to receive organs.\n\nThere is a central public body responsible for making (and funding)\nall purchases and for allocating organs fairly in accordance with\nclinical criteria. Direct sales are banned.\n\nPrices are set at a reasonably generous level to attract people\nvoluntarily into the market.\n\n\n\nFeatures (1) and (2) combined are supposed to rule out exploitative\norgan trafficking from poorer countries, while the ban on direct sales\nand allocation by a central agency ensure that the organs go not to\nthose most able to pay, but to those in most need. In common with\nmany other defenders of organ sale, Erin and Harris also propose\nbuilding in practical protections for donors and recipients (e.g.,\nadequate medical care and thorough health checkups before donation\ntakes place).\n\n\nWhen ethically evaluating organ sale therefore it is best to focus\nnot on the worst aspects of today's organ trafficking practices\n(since that is not what any serious ethicist is defending or proposing)\nbut rather on what a reasonably well-regulated system of organ sale,\ncontrolled by some combination of the medical profession and state\nregulators, would look like. More specifically, it should be\nassumed (as it is in what follows) that the doctors, nurses, and\ntransplant coordinators implementing an organ sale system should at\nleast adhere to the standards around consent and clinical care\nadvocated by The Transplantation Society and the World Health\nOrganisation (leaving aside of course those bodies' opposition to\norgan sale itself) (see Other Internet Resources section below).\n\n\nOne final preliminary point is the distinction between questions of\nlaw and public policy, on the one hand, and personal morality on the\nother. The debate about organ sale is largely about whether this\nshould be allowed (by law) and, if so, about what system of\nremuneration would be best. However, there is a set of separable\nquestions about personal morality: about (for example) whether buying\nan organ for oneself might be morally problematic even if it should\nnot be prohibited. Although this distinction is important, and should\nbe kept in mind throughout, it will not be referred to much in the\nfollowing sections. That is because, for the most part, the very same\narguments are used both in attempts to show that organ sale is morally\nproblematic and in attempts to show that it ought not to be\nallowed.\n",
