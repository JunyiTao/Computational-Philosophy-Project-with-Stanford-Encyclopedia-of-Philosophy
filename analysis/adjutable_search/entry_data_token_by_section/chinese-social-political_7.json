    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Book of Lord Shang: Benefit Through Order\n2.6 Book of Lord Shang: Benefit Through Order\n\nThe Book of Lord Shang (Shangjun shu) builds on two\nthemes that we have already encountered. First, it argues that\n\u201cthe greatest benefit to the people is order\n(zhi)\u201d (SJS ch. 7). This is to implicitly accept that\n\u201cbenefit (li)\u201d is the standard by which theories\nof governance are judged, but it also places particular stress on the\ncollective character of \u201cbenefit\u201d. In a war-torn world, we\nare told, only when the state is strong can its inhabitants flourish.\nThose who act for their own interests rather than for the\n\u201cbenefit of the state\u201d, therefore, are to be punished (SJS\nch. 14). The text is no friend of those who like to debate and push\ntheir own agendas; it prefers a people devoted to agriculture who are\n\u201csimple (pu) and easy to direct\u201d (SJS ch. 3). We\ncan see here, in short, that one result of the fuzziness surrounding\nthe idea of \u201cbenefitting the people\u201d is that if clearer\ncriteria can plausibly be seen as necessary conditions for benefitting\nthe people, they take center stage. A prime example is\n\u201corder\u201d. Disorder, it is natural to assume, is\nincompatible with the people\u2019s well-being, so rulers could\nconcentrate on order and allow benefit to follow in its wake.\nEspecially when combined with the idea that the people tend to be\nselfish and not understand what is really good for them, though, a\nfocus on order can rapidly lead to tyranny.\n\nAnother idea we have seen already is that governance demands objective\nstandards. This is a central theme of the Book of Lord Shang.\nIt repeatedly stresses the importance of public, impartial standards\n(fa) for application of punishment and reward.\n\u201cFa\u201d is often translated \u201claw\u201d, but\nits uses here and elsewhere are clearly broader than mere penal law.\nOne kind of standard, to be sure, is the penal statute\n(xian), but standards take many other forms. The fact that\nrewards and punishments are regularly attached to standards makes it\nclear that these are normative expectations, and not just ideals. In\nanother way the \u201cfa\u201d are more than ideals: they\nare institutionalized. This aspect no doubt explains part of the\nappeal of translating \u201cfa\u201d as \u201claw\u201d,\nsince we often think of laws as norms that are subject to some kind of\nenforcement, unlike ethical ideals.\n\nFinally, the text also insists that there be no debate over what the\nstandards are nor about when they have been fulfilled: the ruler alone\nfixes the standard based on his assessment of the needs of the age. He\nshould neither imitate antiquity nor follow current standards. What is\ncrucial is that his standards set out the distinct roles\n(fen) expected of people, as well as the rewards and\npenalties that will enforce these roles. The text adds that the\nintelligent ruler will not fail to carry out his own role, on pain of\n\u201charming the standards\u201d.\n",
