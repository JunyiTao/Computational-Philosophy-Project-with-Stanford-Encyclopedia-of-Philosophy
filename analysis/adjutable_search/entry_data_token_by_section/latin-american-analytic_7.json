    "main_text": "Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers\n3. Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers\n\nSection 2\n approached Latin American analytic philosophy from a historical\nperspective. This section presents some original contributions by\nanalytic philosophers working in the region regardless of any\ndiachronic considerations. It discusses three types of original\ncontributions: novel contributions to academic debates, novel\ncontributions to the public sphere, and autochthonous research\navenues. Novel contributions to academic debates include either\nuncommon but interesting claims that challenge entrenched views in\ninternational scholarship, or defenses of more traditional claims from\nunusual perspectives.\n Section 3.1\n presents some instances from the philosophies of language and mind.\nNovel contributions to the public sphere comprise applications of\nanalytic tools to address moral and political issues that are tied to\nthe sociopolitical circumstances of Latin American countries. Applied\nethics, bioethics, and philosophy of law are three areas where this\nform of originality can be found\n (Section 3.2).\n Finally, autochthonous research avenues refer to debates that\noriginated in Latin America and could have a significant impact\nworldwide.\n Section 3.3\n offers some examples from metaphilosophy.\n\nFor reasons of space, the following discussion is limited in three\nways. First, it does not cover some areas of analytic philosophy that\neither are insufficiently represented in the region (metaphysics) or\nare already covered by other entries (epistemology, logic, philosophy\nof science, political philosophy) (see the entries\n Philosophy of Science in Latin America,\n Epistemology in Latin America,\n Skepticism in Latin America,\n and\n Liberalism in Latin America).\n Second, it does not offer an exhaustive selection of contributions.\nThe aim is to present a small but representative sample. The\ninterested reader can find references to other significant\ncontributions in the footnotes. Third, it does not critically assess\nthe merits of each contribution. Instead, it provides sufficient\ninformation to show why each contribution is worthy of\nconsideration.\n",
