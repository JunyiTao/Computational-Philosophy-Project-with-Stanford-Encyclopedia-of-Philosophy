    "main_text": "The Case for Neutral Monism || Knowledge of the External World\n3.4 Knowledge of the External World\n\nMach and James understand neutral monism as an especially radical form\nof achieving perceptual contact with the world. It might be understood\nas a limiting case of na\u00efve realism\u2014a case in which the\nrelation between the subject and its perceptual object becomes the\nidentity relation. In perception \u201csubject and object\nmerge\u201d (James 1905: 57). A single reality\u2014a red patch,\nsay, when we see a tomato\u2014is a constituent of two groups of\nneutral entities: the group that is the perceiver, and the group that\nis the tomato. The mind and its object become one. In James\u2019s\nwords:\n\nA given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context of\nassociates, play[s] the part of the knower, or a state of mind, or\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d; while in a different context the same\nundivided bit of experience plays the part of a thing known, of an\nobjective \u201ccontent\u201d. In a word, in one group it figures as\na thought, in another group as a thing. (James 1904b: 9\u201310)\n\n\nSome have seen this epistemic achievement as the most important reward\nof neutral monism.\n\nBut Russell dissented. There are well known problems surrounding\naccounts of perception that conceive it as a form of direct contact\nwith the world. Among them are the problems arising from the fact that\nan object can present different and incompatible appearances to\ndifferent observers, or even the same observer in different\ncircumstances. Some neutral monists concluded that \u201cnature is a\nseething chaos of contradiction\u201d (Holt 1914: 276). But Russell\nchose to abandon the view that in perception \u201csubject and object\nmerge\u201d. Instead he locates the red patch you see when looking at\na tomato in your brain, and distinguishes it from the tomato (from the\ngroup of events that constitute the tomato). That is why he can assert\nthat what is happening in his brain is \u201cexactly what na\u00efve\nrealism thinks it knows about what is happening in the outside\nworld\u201d (Russell 1927b: 138). This solves the problem of\ndifferent and incompatible appearances: compatibility is restored by\nmoving the conflicting features away from the single physical object\nand into the brains of the percipients. But in making this move\nRussell abandons the na\u00efve realism of Mach and James and puts a\nversion of representative realism in its place. The problem of our\nknowledge of the external world is thereby reintroduced in full\n force.[16]\n",
