    "main_text": "Logic || Bolzano\u2019s Conception of Logic\n3.2 Bolzano\u2019s Conception of Logic\n\nBolzano\u2019s logic was based upon a fundamental view that was the\nvery opposite of the common view of his time. Whereas it was quite\ncommon at his time to mix logical with psychological investigations,\nBolzano made every effort to separate them. For him logical concepts\nare concepts of their own, and their definition therefore must be kept\nfree from any psychological admixture (WL I, 61\u201366).\nBolzano\u2019s approach to logic was \u2014 long before Frege and\nHusserl \u2014 unmistakably antipsychologistic, even if he did not\nyet use this term. In order to overcome psychologism and to achieve a\nstrict separation of logic from psychology, Bolzano \u201copened\nup\u201d for logic a realm or \u201cworld\u201d of its own,\ndifferent from the world of material objects as well as from the world\nof mental phenomena, a World 3 to speak with Karl Popper.\nBolzano\u2019s motive for postulating such a logical realm of its own\nobviously was the erroneous belief that logical properties (such as\nlogical truth) and logical relations (such as logical consequence)\nneed purely logical objects as their bearers in order to remain purely\nlogical and free from any psychological admixture themselves. What is\nmore, Bolzano had an unshakeable intuition that there are and must\nbe such purely logical objects, namely \u201cobjective\nsentences\u201d or \u201csentences in themselves\u201d\n(S\u00e4tze an sich), and their parts, i.e., \u201cobjective\nideas\u201d or \u201cideas in themselves\u201d (Vorstellungen\nan sich). In today\u2019s terminology, Bolzano\u2019s\n\u201csentences in themselves\u201d are called\n\u2018propositions\u2019; this term (without any epithet) will be\nused for them in what follows. (The term \u2018sentence\u2019\nwithout epithet, however, will be used in its linguistic sense for\ncertain strings of words or symbols.) Moreover, following\nBolzano\u2019s practice, we will use the term \u2018idea\u2019\n(\u2018Vorstellung\u2019) without epithet for \u2018idea\nin itself\u2019 (\u2018Vorstellung an sich\u2019).\nPropositions and ideas are the objects which can be\n\u201cgrasped\u201d by mental phenomena (subjective propositions, in\nparticular judgments, and subjective ideas) and expressed in language,\nbut \u2014 despite their close connection to their mental and\nlinguistic correlates \u2014 they must be rigorously distinguished\nfrom them.\n\nDue to his conception of logic, Bolzano was \u201cin need\u201d of\npropositions and ideas and therefore postulated that there are such\ngenuinely logical objects. He himself, however, was convinced that he\nneed not postulate them but can undoubtedly prove that there\nmust be propositions and ideas.\n",
