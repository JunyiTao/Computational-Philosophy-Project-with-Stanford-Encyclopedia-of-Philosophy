    "main_text": "Anarchism and Political Activity\n3. Anarchism and Political Activity\n\nAnarchism forces us to re-evaluate political activity. Ancient Greek\nphilosophers such as Aristotle and Plato held that human beings\nflourished within just political communities and that there was a\nvirtue in serving the polis. Modern political philosophy tended to\nhold, as well, that political action\u2014including obedience to the\nlaw and the ideal of a rule of law\u2014was noble and enlightened. In\nHegelian political philosophy, these ideas combine in a way that\ncelebrates citizenship and service to the state. And in contemporary\nliberal political philosophy, it is often presumed that obedience to\nthe law is required as a prima facie duty (see Reiman 1972;\nGans 1992). Anarchists, of course, call this all into question.\n\nThe crucial question for anarchists is thus whether one ought to\ndisengage from political life, whether one ought to submit to\npolitical authority and obey the law, or whether one ought to engage\nin active efforts to actively abolish the state. Those who opt to work\nactively for the abolition of the state often understand this as a\nform of \u201cdirect action\u201d or \u201cpropaganda of the\ndeed\u201d. The idea of direct action is often viewed as typical of\nanarchists, who believe that something ought to be done to actively\nabolish the state including: graffiti, street theater, organized\noccupations, boycotts, and even violence. There are disputes among\nanarchists about what ought to be done, with an important dividing\nline occurring with regard to the question of violence and criminal\nbehavior.\n\nBefore turning to that discussion, let\u2019s note one further\nimportant theoretical distinction with regard to the question of\ntaking action, connected to the typology offered above: whether action\nshould be justified in consequentialist or non-consequentialist terms.\nFranks has argued that anarchist direct action ought to exemplify a\nunity of means and ends (Franks 2003). On this view, if liberation and\nautonomy are what anarchists are pursuing, then the methods used to\nobtain these goods must be liberationist and celebrate\nautonomy\u2014and embody this within direct action. Franks argues\nthat the idea that \u201cthe end justifies the means\u201d is more\ntypical of state-centered movements, such as Bolshevism\u2014and of\nright-wing movements. While some may think that anarchists are willing\nto engage in action \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, that\nphraseology and the crass consequentialism underlying it is more\ntypical of radical movements which are not anarchist. Coercive\nimposition of the anarchist ideal re-inscribes the problem of\ndomination, hierarchy, centralization, and monopolistic power that the\nanarchist was originally opposed to.\n",
