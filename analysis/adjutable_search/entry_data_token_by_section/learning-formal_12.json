    "main_text": "The Limits of Inquiry and the Complexity of Empirical Problems || Point-Set Topology and the Axioms of Verifiability\n3.2 Point-Set Topology and the Axioms of Verifiability\n\nTo further elucidate the learning-theoretic concepts of verifiability\nand refutability, we note that they satisfy the following fundamental\nproperties. We give informal but rigorous proofs.\n\nA disjunction of verifiable hypotheses is also\nverifiable.\n\n\nProof: Let \\(H = H_1\\) or\n\\(H_2,\\ldots\\) or \\(H_n\\) or \u2026\nbe a disjunction of verifiable hypotheses \\(H_i\\) (the\ndisjunction may be infinite). Suppose that \\(H\\) is correct for a\ncomplete data sequence. Then some \\(H_i\\) is correct\nfor the data sequence. Since \\(H_i\\) is verifiable,\nthere is a finite number of observations that entails\n\\(H_i\\), which entails \\(H\\). So if \\(H\\) is\ncorrect for any complete data sequence, there is a finite number of\nobservations from the sequence that entails \\(H\\), as required\nfor verifiability. For example, let \\(H_i\\) be the\nverifiable hypothesis that there is a non-black raven at time\n\\(i\\). Then the hypothesis \\(H =\\) \u201csome (observed)\nraven is not black\u201d is equivalent to the disjunction\n\\(H_1\\) or \\(H_2,\\ldots\\) or\n\\(H_n\\) or \u2026. Since each hypothesis\n\\(H_i\\) is verifiable, so is \\(H\\).\n \nA finite conjunction of verifiable hypotheses is also\nverifiable.\n\n\nProof: Let \\(H = H_1\\) and \\(H_2,\\ldots\\) and \\(H_n\\) be a finite\nconjunction of verifiable hypotheses \\(H_i\\).  Suppose that \\(H\\) is\ncorrect for a complete data sequence. Then each \\(H_i\\) is correct for\nthe data sequence. Since \\(H_i\\) is verifiable, there is a finite\nnumber of observations that entails \\(H_i\\). Because there are only\nfinite many hypotheses \\(H_i\\), eventually each hypothesis will be\nverified by a finite number of observations, which entails their\nconjunction \\(H\\). So if \\(H\\) is correct for any complete data\nsequence, there is a finite number of observations from the sequence\nthat entails \\(H\\), as required for verifiability. For example, let\n\\(H_1\\) be the verifiable hypothesis that the first raven is non-black\nand let \\(H_2\\) be the verifiable hypothesis that the second raven is\nnon-black. If the conjunction \\(H = H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) is correct for a\ndata sequence, then the first two ravens are not black. The\nobservation of the first two ravens therefore entails \\(H\\).\n \nA tautology and a contradiction are (trivially)\nverifiable.\n\n\nProof: A tautology (like \u201cthe first observed raven is black or\nis not black\u201d) is correct for any data sequence and entailed by\nany evidence sequence. A contradiction (like \u201cthe first observed\nraven is black and is not black\u201d) is trivially verified if it is\ncorrect because it is never correct.\n \nA hypothesis is verifiable if and only if its negation is\nrefutable.\n\n\nProof: We consider the only-if direction; the converse is similar.\nSuppose that the negation not H of a hypothesis is refutable.\nConsider any complete data sequence for which hypothesis \\(H\\) is\ncorrect. Then not H is incorrect, and will be falsified by a\nfinite number of observations, since it is refutable. This finite\nobservation set entails \\(H\\). So if \\(H\\) is correct for\nany complete data sequence, there is a finite number of observations\nfrom the sequence that entails \\(H\\), as required for\nverifiability. For example, \\( H=\\) \u201csome (observed) raven\nis not black\u201d is the negation of the refutable hypothesis\nnot \\(H =\\) \u201call (observed) ravens are black\u201d. If\nnot \\(H\\) is incorrect for a complete data sequence, it will be\neventually falsified by the observation of a non-black raven. This\nobservation entails \\(H\\).\n \n\n\nRemarkably, the properties listed are exactly the fundamental axioms\nof an important branch of mathematics known as  point-set \ntopology [Abramsky 1987, Vickers 1986]. A topological space is defined\nby a collection of sets known as  open sets or\nneighbourhoods, that satisfy the axiomatic properties of verifiable\nhypotheses (closure under arbitrary union and finite disjunction, both\nthe empty set and the entire space are open). The set-theoretic\ncomplements of open sets are called closed sets, so refutable\nhypotheses correspond exactly to closed sets. Point-set topology was\ninvented to support a kind of generalized functional analysis without\nnumbers (more precisely, without distances). It is striking that the\nfoundational axioms of topology have an exact epistemological\ninterpretation in terms of the properties of empirical hypotheses that\nallow verification or falsification with certainty. Current\nmathematical developments of learning theory often begin by taking as\na basic concept a set of verifiable hypotheses satisfying the\nproperties listed. This approach has two advantages.\n\nLearning theory can draw on, and contribute to, the rich body of\nconcepts and results from one of the most developed branches of modern\nmathematics [Kelly 1996, Baltag et al. 2015, de Brecht and Yamamoto\n2008].\nThe flexibility to adapt the notion of evidence item to the\ncontext of an application makes it easier to apply the general theory\nin different domains. For example, consider the problem of obtaining\nincreasing precisely measurements of a quantity of interest (e.g. the\nspeed of light in physics). We can take the basic set of verifiable\nhypotheses to be (unions of) open intervals around the true value of\nthe quantity [Baltag et al. 2015, MONIST, Genin and Kelly 2017].\nAnother example is the concept of statistical verifiability covered in\n Section 6\n below.\n\n\nFor the sake of concreteness, this entry describes examples where the\nbasic verifiable hypotheses are disjunctions of finite sequences of\nevidence items. We will describe definitions and results in such a way\nthat they assume only the axiomatic properties listed so that they are\neasy to apply in other settings.\n",
