    "main_text": "Arguments Against Compositionality || How Compositionality Allegedly Fails\n4.2 How Compositionality Allegedly Fails\n\nWe now discuss briefly four famous putative counterexamples to the\ncompositionality of English from the semantic literature. The list is\nsupposed to be representative but by no means exhaustive. (For a more\nsystematic survey of how compositionality problems are typically\nsolved in formal semantics, see Zimmerman 2012.) In each case, we also\nindicate what reasonable responses to the challenges might look\nlike.\n\nPutative counterexamples to\n (C)\n are always complex expressions whose meaning appears to depend not\nonly on the meanings of their constituents and on their structure but\non some third factor as well. Sometimes this third factor is\nlinguistic context: what a complex expression means seems to depend in\npart on how it is embedded into a sentence\n (\u00a7 4.2.1)\n or a sequence of sentences\n (\u00a7 4.2.2).\n In other cases the third factor is extra-linguistic: the setting in\nwhich the complex expression is used\n (\u00a7 4.2.3)\n or someone\u2019s beliefs about what the expression means\n (\u00a7 4.2.4).\n\nSuch putative counterexamples are not all on the same level. Although\nthey all violate the letter of\n (C),\n some could be more easily reconciled with productivity and\nsystematicity than others. If it turned out that in order to interpret\nan embedded sentence, one needs information about the embedding\nsentence as well we would have to conclude that the algorithm for\ncalculating the meanings of complex expressions is more complicated\nthen we thought. But a complicated algorithm is still an algorithm and\nthe core explanation of how we understand complex expressions would\nremain untouched. By contrast, if it turned out that in order to\ninterpret a sentence we must know all sorts of ephemeral\nnon-linguistic facts we would have to conclude that the fact that we\ncan reliably understand all sorts of unfamiliar sentences is a\nmystery. Those who accept putative counterexamples of this latter kind\nmust provide alternative explanations for productivity and\nsystematicity.\n4.2.1 Conditionals\n\nConsider the following minimal pair:\n\n(1)\nEveryone will succeed if he works hard. \n(2)\n No one will succeed if he goofs off. \n\n\nA good translation of (1) into a first-order language is (1\u2032).\nBut the analogous translation of (2) would yield (2\u2032), which is\ninadequate. A good translation for (2) would be (2\u2033) but it is\nunclear why. We might convert \u2018\\(\\neg \\exists\\)\u2019 to the\nequivalent \u2018\\(\\forall \\neg\\)\u2019 but then we must also\ninexplicably push the negation into the consequent of the embedded\nconditional.\n\n(1\u2032)\n\\( \\forall x\\)(x works hard \\(\\rightarrow x\\) will\nsucceed) \n(2\u2032)\n\\( \\neg \\exists x\\) (x goofs off \\(\\rightarrow x\\) will\nsucceed)\n(2\u2033)\n\\( \\forall x\\) (x goofs off \\(\\rightarrow \\neg(x\\) will\nsucceed))\n\n\nThis gives rise to a problem for the compositionality of English,\nsince is seems rather plausible that the syntactic structure of (1)\nand (2) is the same and that \u2018if\u2019 contributes some sort of\nconditional connective\u2014not necessarily a material\nconditional!\u2014to the meaning of (1). But it seems that it cannot\ncontribute just that to the meaning of (2). More precisely, the\ninterpretation of an embedded conditional clause appears to be\nsensitive to the nature of the quantifier in the embedding\nsentence\u2014a violation of compositionality (the problem is\noriginally raised in Higginbotham 1986).\n\nOne response might be to claim that \u2018if\u2019 does not\ncontribute a conditional connective to the meaning of either (1) or\n(2)\u2014rather, it marks a restriction on the domain of the\nquantifier, as the paraphrases under (1\u2033) and (2\u2033)\n suggest:[19]\n\n(1\u2033)\n Everyone who works hard will succeed. \n(2\u2033)\nNo one who goofs off will succeed. \n\n\nBut this simple proposal (however it may be implemented) runs into\ntrouble when it comes to quantifiers like \u2018most\u2019. Unlike\n(3\u2032), (3) says that those students (in the contextually given\ndomain) who succeed if they work hard are most of the students (in the\ncontextually relevant domain):\n\n(3)\n Most students will succeed if they work hard. \n(3\u2032) \n Most students who work hard will succeed. \n\n\n\nSection 6.4. of Stalnaker (2014) contains a detailed defense of the claim that this problem and related ones are properly handled if we use the semantics of Stalnaker (1975) for indicative conditionals. But the predictions depend essentially on the fact that on this account, conditionals are context-dependent and their interpretation is constrained by certain pragmatic principles. There are many alternative approaches on the market and the question how best account for these examples remains controversial.[20]\n4.2.2 Cross-sentential anaphora\n\nConsider the following minimal pair from Barbara Partee:\n\n(4)\nI dropped ten marbles and found all but one of them. It is\nprobably under the sofa.\n\n(5)\n I dropped ten marbles and found nine of them. It is probably\nunder the sofa.\n\n\nThere is a clear difference between (4) and (5)\u2014the first one is\nunproblematic, the second markedly odd. This difference is plausibly a\nmatter of meaning, and so (4) and (5) cannot be synonyms. Nonetheless,\nthe first sentences are at least truth-conditionally equivalent. If we\nadopt a conception of meaning where truth-conditional equivalence is\nsufficient for synonymy, we have an apparent counterexample to\ncompositionality.\n\nFew would insist that the first sentences of (4) and (5) are really\nsynonymous. What is interesting about this example is that even if we\nconclude that we should opt for a more fine grained conception of\nmeaning, it is not immediately clear how that will account for the\ncontrast between these sentences. The difference is obviously due to\nthe fact that \u2018one\u2019 occurs in the first sentence of (4),\nwhich is available as a proper antecedent for \u2018it\u2019 and\nthat there is nothing in the first sentence of (5) that could play a\nsimilar role. Some authors have suggested that the right way to\napproach this problem is to opt for a dynamic conception of meaning,\none that can encode anaphoric possibilities for subsequent sentences\n(cf. Heim 1982; Groenendijk & Stokhof 1990, 1991; and Chierchia\n1995).\n\nInteresting though these cases might be, it is not at all clear that\nwe are faced with a genuine challenge to compositionality, even if we\nwant to stick with the idea that meanings are just truth-conditions.\nFor it is not clear that (5) lacks the normal reading of (4)\u2014on\nreflection it seems better to say that the reading is available even\nthough it is considerably harder to get. (Contrast this with an\nexample due to\u2014I think\u2014Irene Heim: \u2018They got\nmarried. She is beautiful.\u2019 This is like (5) because the first\nsentence lacks an explicit antecedent for the pronoun in the second.\nNonetheless, it is clear that the bride is said to be beautiful.) If\nthe difference between (4) and (5) is only this, it is no longer clear\nthat we must accept the idea that they must differ in meaning.\n4.2.3 Adjectives\n\nSuppose a Japanese maple leaf, turned brown, has been painted green.\nConsider someone pointing at this leaf uttering (6):\n\n(6)\nThis leaf is green.\n\n\nThe utterance could be true on one occasion (say, when the speaker is\nsorting leaves for decoration) and false on another (say, when the\nspeaker is trying to identify the species of tree the leaf belongs\nto). The meanings of the words are the same on both occasions and so\nis their syntactic composition. But the meaning of (6) on these two\noccasions\u2014what (6) says when uttered in these\noccasions\u2014is different. As Charles Travis, the inventor of this\nexample puts it: \u201c\u2026words may have all the stipulated\nfeatures while saying something true, but also while saying something\nfalse\u201d (Travis 1994: 171\u2013172; see also Travis 1996 and Lahav 1989).\n\nThere are many possible responses to this challenge. One is to deny\nthe relevant intuition. Perhaps the leaf really is green if it is\npainted green and (6) is uttered truly in both situations.\nNonetheless, we might be sometimes reluctant to make such a true\nutterance for fear of being misleading. We might be taken to falsely\nsuggest that the leaf is green under the paint or that it is not\npainted at all (cf. Sainsbury 2001 and Berg 2002).\nThe second option is to point out that the fact that a sentence can\nsay one thing on one occasion and something else on another is not in\nconflict with its meaning remaining the same. Do we have then a\nchallenge to compositionality of reference, or perhaps to\ncompositionality of content? Not clear, for the reference or content\nof \u2018green\u2019 may also change between the two situations.\nThis could happen, for example, if the lexical representation of this\nword contains an indexical\n element.[21]\n If this seems ad hoc, we can say instead that although there\nis no context-dependent expression in (6) it can still be used to make\nboth true and false assertions. Perhaps the compositionally determined\noccasion meanings are impoverished (perhaps not even propositional),\nwhich is why they tend to be different from what speakers assert (cf.\nBach 1994 and Soames 2005).\n4.2.4 Propositional attitudes\n\nPerhaps the most widely known objection to compositionality comes from\nthe observation that even if e and \\(e'\\) are synonyms, the\ntruth-values of sentences where they occur embedded within the clausal\ncomplement of a mental attitude verb may well differ. So, despite the\nfact that \u2018eye-doctor\u2019 and \u2018ophthalmologist\u2019\nare synonyms (7) may be true and (8) false if Carla is ignorant of\nthis fact:\n\n(7)\nCarla believes that eye doctors are rich.\n(8)\nCarla believes that ophthalmologists are rich.\n\n\nSo, we have a case of apparent violation of compositionality; cf.\nPelletier (1994).\n\nThere is a sizable literature on the semantics of\n propositional attitude reports\n (see entry). Some think that considerations like this show that there\nare no genuine synonyms in natural languages. If so, compositionality\n(at least the language-bound version) is of course vacuously true.\nSome deny the intuition that (7) and (8) may differ in\ntruth-conditions and seek explanations for the contrary appearance in\nterms of\n implicature.[22]\n Some give up the letter of compositionality but still provide\nrecursive semantic\n clauses.[23]\n And some preserve compositionality by postulating a hidden indexical\nassociated with \u2018believe\u2019 (for example, Richard 1990, Crimmins & Perry\n1989, and Crimmins 1992).",
