    "main_text": "Integrity and Moral Theory\n9. Integrity in relation to Social and Political Conditions\n\nEven where the social and political dimensions of integrity are\ndiscussed, integrity is often seen as largely a private or personal\naffair\u2014albeit one with important implications in the public\nsphere. Less attention has been given to ways in which social (e.g.\nfamily, business, religious) and political (e.g. forms of government)\nstructures and processes may affect personal integrity. They can do\nthis either by promoting or undermining features essential to having\nor practicing integrity; or by aiding, abetting, or being inimical to\nthe defeaters of integrity (e.g., self-deception). If integrity is as\ncentral and important a virtue as recent work on the topic suggests,\nthen ideally the institutions\u2014including forms of government and\neconomic arrangements\u2014that help shape our lives should be\nstructured in ways that promote integrity. Arguably, this is not the\ncase, and why it may not be the case, and how to change it, is as much\na problem for social and political philosophy, and ethics generally,\nas it is for philosophical psychology.\n\nSusan Babbitt (1997, 118) says that an adequate account of personal\nintegrity must:\n\n\u2026recognize that some social structures are of the wrong sort\naltogether for some individuals to be able to pursue personal\nintegrity, and that questions about the moral nature of society often\nneed to be asked first before questions about personal integrity can\nproperly be raised. Questions about integrity may turn out to be, not\nabout the relationship between individual characteristics, interests,\nchoices and so on, and a society, but rather about what kind of\nsociety it is in terms of which an individual comes to possess certain\ninterests, characteristics, and so on. This does not imply that\nquestions about personal integrity are entirely moral, not having to\ndo with idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; instead, it\nsuggests that the very meaning of personal integrity in particular\ncases sometimes depends upon more general considerations about the\nnature of the society that makes some idiosyncratic properties\nidentifying and others not. The pursuit of adequate personal integrity\noften depends, not so much on understanding who one is and what one\nbelieves and is committed to, but rather understanding what\none\u2019s society is and imagining what it could be.\n\n\nBabbitt explicitly links personal integrity to political and social\nstructures in a way that broadens the concept of integrity. What she\nsays is applicable to all of the views that we have discussed. But her\naccount also enables us to raise questions about the relationship\nbetween social structures and personal integrity. The most general\nquestion is what kinds of society and what kinds of practice within a\nsociety are most conducive to personal integrity?\n\nIf society is structured in such a way that it undermines\npeople\u2019s attempt at either knowing or acting upon their\ncommitments, values and desires, then such a structure is inimical to\nintegrity. And if integrity is connected to well-being, then adverse\nsocial and political conditions are a threat\u2014not merely an\nultimate threat, but also a daily threat\u2014to well-being. The\ntwentieth century technical term for this mismatch is alienation.\nAlienation results when people are so confused or conflicted\u2014are\nrelentlessly exposed, for example, to the social manufacture of\nincompatible desires\u2014that they take on roles they mistakenly\nbelieve they want or deceive themselves about wanting.\n\nAre political and social conditions in contemporary liberal\ndemocracies conducive both to acquiring the self-understanding\nnecessary for integrity and, more generally, to the business of acting\nwith integrity? Historically, one of the governing ideals of liberal\ndemocratic societies is to provide its citizens, not with the goods\nthey desire, but with certain primary goods, such as freedom, and with\npolitical/social/cultural structures (laws, codes, institutions,\npractices, and so on) that facilitate their capacity to obtain goods\nthey desire for themselves. This is one reason education has always\nplayed a prominent role in discussion of liberal-democratic forms of\nlife. Education is seen as a crucial structure in the facilitation of\nindividuals\u2019 pursuit of chosen goods. Such an instrumental view\nof education is rather narrow and omits any role for inculcation of\nthe means to choose goods wisely. Integrity requires more than\nfacilitation of an instrumental capacity to acquired desired goods. It\nrequires the wisdom and self-knowledge to choose appropriate goods,\nworthwhile goals, and so on. It is, perhaps, hard to see extant social\neducational structures playing a very significant role in this\nprocess, and harder still to imagine real\ninstitutions\u2014institutions compatible with the demands and\nlimitations of contemporary life\u2014that would.\n\nIf social educational structures fail to facilitate the life of\nintegrity, other structures may be positively hostile to it. Arguably,\nand despite what might seem like overwhelming choice, job markets are\nstructured by financial and other incentives, restricted opportunities\nand economic rents. The result is that many people choose careers they\ndo not really want and for which they are barely suited. There are\nother perhaps more straightforward ways in which social and cultural\nstructures may be inimical to the pursuit of integrity. The ideology\nof love, for instance, may undermine the integrity of lovers, as it\nmay undermine the possibility of genuine and realistic love. In\nprofessional life, people may be called upon (not only tacitly) to\nlie, bluff or manipulate the truth in ways that directly or indirectly\naffect their integrity. The construction of a mission statement or a\nstrategic plan is in some ways an open invitation to dissemble, pander\nand obfuscate. The expectation that one \u2018sells oneself\u2019 or\n\u2018sells the company\u2019 provides explicit reward for\nhypocrites and sycophants. And there are many kinds of assessments,\nreports and application processes that foster both deception and\nself-deception. If this is right, then contemporary society is\ninimical to a life of integrity in many small-scale ways. Broad social\nstructures also have a deleterious effect on our capacity to live with\nintegrity and here, of course, the effects of totalitarian regimes are\nmore extreme than those liberal democracies.\n\nThose who are oppressed seem to be in a paradoxical relation to\nintegrity. On the one hand, members of oppressed groups would seem to\nbe deprived of the conditions for developing integrity: the freedom to\nmake choices how to act and think. As Babbitt (1997, 118) notes, one\nneeds to be able to make choices in order to develop the kinds of\ninterests and concerns which are central to leading a life of\nintegrity. On the other hand, oppressed people are often able to\nreflect on political and social realities with the greater insight\nbecause they do not benefit from them. They have no incentive to adopt\nself-deceptive/self-protective attitudes about circumstances of\noppression or to see past them with convenient blindness. Oppressed\ngroups therefore have all the more scope to think about social reality\nwith integrity, and to act out of this understanding with integrity. A\ncapacity for reflection and understanding enables one to work toward\nintegrity even if it does not ensure that one achieves an ideal of\nintegrity.\n\nAny attempt to strive for integrity has to take account of the effect\nof social and political context. The kind of society which is likely\nto be more conducive to integrity is one which enables people to\ndevelop and make use of their capacity for critical reflection, one\nwhich does not force people to take up particular roles because of\ntheir sex or race or any other reason, and one which does not\nencourage individuals to betray each other, either to escape prison or\nto advance their career. Societies and political structures can be\nboth inimical and favorable to the development of integrity, sometimes\nboth at once.\n",
