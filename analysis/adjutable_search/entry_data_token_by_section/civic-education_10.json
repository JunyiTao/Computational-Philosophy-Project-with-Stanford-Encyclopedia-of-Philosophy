    "main_text": "The Good Democrat || Public Work\n2.4 Public Work\n\nHarry C. Boyte (1996, 2004) argues for the centrality of work\nto citizenship. We are not only citizens when we vote, read and\ndiscuss the news, and volunteer after school or work--which are all\nunpaid, voluntary activities. We are also citizens on the job; and\neven when we perform unpaid service, we should see our contributions\nas work-like in the sense that they are serious business. Citizens do\nnot merely monitor and influence the government (per the theory of\ndeliberative democracy) nor serve other people in community settings\n(emphasized in the idea of social capital); they also literally build,\nmake, and maintain public goods. They do so whether they work in the\npublic, private, or nonprofit sectors, for pay or not. Of course, they\ncan work either well or badly, and a good citizen is one who\nmakes valuable contributions to the public good, or builds \u201cthe\ncommonwealth.\u201d\n\nThe theory of public work suggests that civic education should be\nhighly experiential and closely related to vocational education. Young\npeople should gain skills and agency by actually making things\ntogether. A good outcome is an individual who will be able to\ncontribute to the commonwealth through her or his work. Albert Dzur\n(2008), who holds a kindred but not identical view, emphasizes the\nimportance of revising professional education so that professionals\nlearn to collaborate better with laypeople.\n",
