    "main_text": "Bacon\u2019s Later Philosophy: Language Study and Science in the Service of both Moral Philosophy and Theology || Bacon\u2019s political philosophy: the Secretum secretorum\n6. Conclusion\n\nIt will be clear from this account that Roger Bacon was an important\nteacher of the Arts at Paris in the 1240s. He was ahead of his time in\nthe vigorous manner in which he integrated the new Aristotle with the\ntraditional Latin traditions of grammar and logic. He taught for a\nlong period in the Arts. He later called himself an expert in the\nphilosophy of Aristotle as interpreted by Avicenna and Averroes. And\nwe should also add Avicebron (Solomon Ibn Gabirol). By 1248\u201349 he\nseems to have become an independent scholar. He then, it would seem,\nreturned to England, where, under the influence of Adam Marsh, friend\nof Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, he was attracted to\ninterests associated with both scholars: language study including the\nlearning of ancient languages, experimental concerns such as optics\nand experimental science, and a renewed critical study of the text of\nScripture. When Bacon returned to Paris in the 1250s, he was to oppose\nwhat had become a profound change in the methodology of university\nlearning, that is, the introduction of the\n\u201cSentence-Method\u201d into the study of theology. For Bacon,\nthis was a destruction of practices that he associated with Robert\nGrosseteste. Taking up the flag of the Bishop of Lincoln (d. 1253), he\nbecame the great critic of the Parisian mode of doing philosophy and\ntheology. As we saw above, Bacon was already by 1266 very concerned\nwith the new heterodox interpretations of Aristotle found in the\nFaculty of Arts. His later works for Pope Clement IV must be read in\nthe context of the Parisian debates on Latin Averroism\n(1266\u20131277).\n\nThe later Roger Bacon has a good knowledge of the geography and\nhistory of the world and an awareness of geo-politics. In this\ncontext, he devoted much time to the important work on the education\nof the Prince, the Secretum secretorum. He may have returned to\nOxford c. 1280, if not before. There, he completed his edition, with\nnotes and introduction, of this work. In his last work, the\nCompendium studii theologiae (c. 1292), he repeats some of the\nmain arguments from the 1260s against Richard Rufus of Cornwall. Roger\nBacon sets out themes in his philosophy of language, philosophy of\nnature, and moral philosophy and theology that would influence\nfourteenth century writers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham,\namong others. Jeremiah Hackett examines the influence of Roger Bacon\non the philosophy of mind in John Pecham (Hackett 2018c).\nBacon\u2019s influence on the fourteenth century has been documented\nby Katherine H. Tachau (1988). He is much more important for the\nphilosophy of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries than has\nhitherto been recognized. The editors of Peter of John Olivi on matter\nhave noted the appropriation by Olivi of Bacon\u2019s teaching on\nmatter. Doninique Demange and Yael Kedar have demonstrated Peter John\nOlivi\u2019s critical appropriation of Bacon\u2019s theory of Vision\nand his natural philosophy (Demange & Kedar, 2020). Jeremiah\nHackett (2018a) has suggested that in the early to mid-1260s, Olivi\nmay have been the Iuvenis Johannes, Bacon\u2019s star student.\nRecently, Mattia Montovani has written a very important study on the\nimportance of Bacon\u2019s theory of vision for the new Cartesian\ndiscussions of vision in the early 17th century. It is a study of\nmajor significance for the influence of Bacon on early modern\nphilosophy. (Montovani 2020) As noted above, the newly formed\nRoger Bacon Research Society will in the near future do much\nto further the study of the scientific, philosophical and theological\nworks of Roger Bacon. \n",
