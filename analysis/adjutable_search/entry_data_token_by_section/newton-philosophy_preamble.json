    "main_text": "\n\nIsaac Newton (1642\u20131727) lived in a philosophically tumultuous\ntime. He witnessed the end of the Aristotelian dominance of philosophy\nin Europe, the rise and fall of Cartesianism, the emergence of\n\u201cexperimental philosophy,\u201d and the development of numerous\nexperimental and mathematical methods for the study of nature. Indeed,\nhe helped to develop many of those methods. Newton\u2019s\ncontributions to mathematics\u2014including the co-discovery with\nG.W. Leibniz of what we now call the calculus\u2014and to what is now\ncalled physics, including both its experimental and theoretical\naspects, will forever dominate discussions of his lasting influence.\nHis impact on the development of early modern philosophy was also\nprofound; indeed, it is difficult to grasp the history of philosophy\nin the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries without\nconsidering Newton\u2019s role. His engagement with Cartesian ideas\nand methods early in his life was just as significant to the\ntransformation of philosophy in the seventeenth century as his debates\nwith Leibniz were to the setting of the agenda of philosophy in the\neighteenth. Obviously, Newton is not part of the traditional\nphilosophy canon of the period. That fact reflects an anachronistic\napproach to the history of modern philosophy that we have inherited\nfrom French and German scholars of the nineteenth century. During the\nheight of the Enlightenment, Newton was always characterized as a\ncanonical philosopher: for instance, he plays a leading role in the\nvery first \u201cmodern\u201d history of modern philosophy, Johann\nJacob Brucker\u2019s Historia Critica Philosophiae of 1744.\nEvery major Enlightenment thinker, from Diderot to D\u2019Alembert to\nKant, was influenced by Brucker\u2019s account of modern philosophy.\nIn tandem, numerous works on \u201cNewton\u2019s philosophy\u201d\nand his \u201cphilosophical discoveries\u201d were published\nthroughout the eighteenth century in every major European language. By\nthe early nineteenth century, however, a separation between\n\u201cscience\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d had been\neffectuated, which led to Newton\u2019s shunting into the science\ncanon. Recent scholarship has challenged this conception of the canon.\nMoreover, Newton engaged with, or influenced, many of the standardly\ncanonical philosophers of the early modern era, including Descartes,\nLocke, Berkeley, Hume, Leibniz and Kant. His influence on early modern\nphilosophy is a rich topic.\n",
