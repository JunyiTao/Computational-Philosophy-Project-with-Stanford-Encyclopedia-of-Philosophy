The\ncore point of the argument is that the topology used to distinguish\nthese representations as different, namely the uniform operator\ntopology or \u201cnorm topology\u201d, is inappropriately fine-grained (where a topology defines what is meant by the\nneighborhood of an element). Therefore, it classifies representations\nas inequivalent, which are in fact empirically and therefore\n\u201cphysically equivalent.\u201d The whole argument depends decisively on a theorem by Fell (1960), according to which a finite\nnumber of measurements, performed with some inaccuracy, can never\ndistinguish unitarily inequivalent representations. They are\n\u201cweakly equivalent,\u201d a notion introduced by Fell (1960), using a weak operator topology. Invoking Fell\u2019s theorem and equating weak equivalence and physical equivalence,\nHaag & Kastler (1964) reason that the \u201crelevant object is the abstract algebra and not the representation. The selection of a particular (faithful) representation is a matter of convenience\nwithout physical implications. It may provide a more or less handy\nanalytical apparatus.\u201d\n\nArageorgis (1995), Ruetsche (2003, 2011), Lupher & Kronz (2005),\nand most recently, Lupher (2018) attack algebraic imperialists for\nusing Fell\u2019s theorem in order to denigrate UIRs.\nRuetsche\u2019s most important point is that UIRs do real explanatory\nwork in physics, e.g., in quantum statistical mechanics (see Bratteli\n& Robinson 1997 and Ruetsche 2003) and in particular when it comes\nto spontaneous symmetry breaking. The coexistence of UIRs can be\nreadily understood by looking at ferromagnetism for infinite spin\nchains (see Ruetsche 2006). At high temperatures the atomic dipoles in\nferromagnetic substances fluctuate randomly. Below a certain\ntemperature the atomic dipoles tend to align to each other in some\ndirection. Since the basic laws governing this phenomenon are\nrotationally symmetrical, no direction is preferred. Thus once the\ndipoles have \u201cchosen\u201d one particular direction, the\nsymmetry is broken. Since there is a different ground state for each\ndirection of magnetization, one needs different Hilbert\nspace representations\u2014each containing a unique ground state\u2014in order to\ndescribe symmetry breaking systems. Correspondingly, one has to employ\ninequivalent representations.\n\nAlready Lupher & Kronz (2005) point out that an attractive\nalternative to the strict \\(C^{\\ast}\\)-algebraic\nimperialism is to extend the\nphysical content to von Neumann algebras, the elements of which are\ngenerated by representations of algebra \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nLupher (2018) analyzes the algebraic\nimperialists\u2019 use of Fell\u2019s theorem in detail and points\nout that there are important representations in the algebraic approach\nto which Fell\u2019s theorem does not apply, in particular many \\(W^{\\ast}\\)-algebras,\nthe abstract\ncounterparts of von Neumann algebras. Moreover, he argues that it is a\n\\(W^{\\ast}\\)-algebra, namely the\nbidual \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\ast \\ast}\\),\nwhich is the appropriate locus of physical content for the algebraic\nimperialist, to which Lupher subscribes in the form of what he dubs\n\u201cbidualism.\u201d One crucial advantage of taking the \\(W^{\\ast}\\)-algebra\n\\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\ast\n\\ast}\\) is that it is larger than\nthe \\(C^{\\ast}\\)-algebra \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nIn particular it also\ncontains what Ruetsche (2011) calls \u201cparochial\nobservables\u201d (or the abstract counterparts thereof), such as net\nmagnetization and particle number. Also against Ruetsche, Feintzeig\n(2018) argues that not only the universalist (or bidualist) but also\n\\(C^{\\ast}\\)-algebraic imperialism\nhas access to \u201cparochial observables,\u201d since it has\nadditional tools to represent such observables by means of\nidealizations from the observables in the abstract algebra.\n\nTo conclude, it is difficult to say how the availability of UIRs\nshould be interpreted in general. Clifton and Halvorson (2001b)\npropose seeing this as a form of complementarity. Ruetsche (2003)\nadvocates a \u201cSwiss army approach\u201d, according to which the\navailability of UIRs shows that physical possibilities in different\ndegrees must be included into our ontology. In addition, Ruetsche\n(2011: 119) argues that both Hilbert space conservatism and algebraic\nimperialism are extremist, or \u201cpristine\u201d, positions in the\nend. Accordingly, she advocates taking UIRs more seriously than in\nthese extremist approaches. As we have just seen, however, recent\nadherents of algebraic imperialism and universalism/bidualism have\naccepted the challenge.\n",
