    "main_text": "Feminist Philosophy of Science || Feminist Empiricist Holism\n4.1 Feminist Empiricist Holism\n\nOne way in which feminist philosophers of science have accounted for\nthe role of values in science is through an empiricist holism. As\nMiriam Solomon has noted, many feminist empiricists were influenced by\nthe American pragmatists of the second half of the twentieth century,\nparticularly Wilfred Sellars, Willard van Orman Quine, and Donald\nDavidson. Among the similarities that result from this influence is\ntheir naturalized approach to the philosophy of science, in that they\nbase their accounts on the knowledge practices of the sciences on\nwhich they focus. They are empiricists in taking experience as the\nultimate arbitrator of our beliefs; they are holists in that they take\nbeliefs to answer to experience as whole\u2014in Quine\u2019s\nphrase, as a \u201cweb of belief\u201d\u2014rather than\none-by-one.\n\nLynn Hankinson Nelson (1990) is explicit in her debt to Quine, others\nare less so. Longino\u2019s contextual empiricism, discussed in\ndetail elsewhere (see the entries on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science,\n feminist social epistemology,\n the social dimensions of scientific knowledge,\n and briefly in this entry in\n section 4.2),\n is one of the most influential of these approaches and differs from\nother empiricist approaches, most notably in the role that she\nascribes to values and how she believes that differences in values\nshould be adjudicated (Longino 1990, 2002). Other versions of holism\nappear in the work of Lynn Hankinson Nelson (1990), Elizabeth Anderson\n(1995a, 2004), and Sharyn Clough (2003a, 2003b, 2012) all of whom,\nunlike Longino, argue that values should answer to empirical evidence.\nSolomon has dubbed the latter approach \u201cfeminist radical\nempiricism\u201d (Solomon 2012: 435).\n\nSince it is clear that problematic sexist values can distort science\n(see the examples discussed previously in\n section 2)\n much of the work of feminists exploring the role of values in science\nfocuses instead on the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate\nuses of values, and also on the legitimacy of the values\nthemselves.\n\nAnderson argues that values are used legitimately when they are used\nnon-dogmatically. As an illustration she offers an analysis of Abigail\nStewart et al.\u2019s (1997) research on divorce (Anderson\n2004)\u2014research that was explicitly guided by feminist values in\na variety of ways. According to Anderson, the values that Stewart and\nher team of researchers brought to their investigation are of the sort\nthat are answerable to empirical evidence\u2014the evidence of\nemotional states.\n\nAnderson examines how background values function at various stages of\nStewart et al.\u2019s research: the framing of research questions,\nthe understanding of the objects of inquiry, the making of decisions\nabout what data to collect, the generation and sampling of data, the\nanalysis of the data including the choice of technique for analysis,\ndecisions about when to end data analysis, and what conclusions are\ndrawn. To illustrate, consider just one of these stages\u2014the way\nthat values enter into understanding the objects of inquiry.\n\nIn the case of studying divorce, there are a variety of such objects\nthat need to be considered, but prominent among these are\n\u201cdivorce\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d. Stewart\u2019s\nresearch team identifies these objects of inquiry as\n\u201cthickly\u201d described\u2014meaning that values are\nincorporated into their descriptions. Anderson notes that, for\nexample, Stewart\u2019s team understanding of divorce incorporated\ndifferent values than those used in Judith Wallerstein and Joan\nKelly\u2019s research (Wallerstein & Kelly 1980). For Wallerstein\nand Kelly loss and trauma are fundamental aspects of divorce.\nStewart\u2019s team, in contrast, took divorce to be a process of\nadjustment to a new state. On this alternate understanding divorce is\nnot treated as a one-time event with an aftermath but rather as an\nongoing life adjustment. This framing also treats the process of\nadjustment as open-ended allowing for both positive and negative\neffects. Wallerstein and Kelly\u2019s framing of divorce as a trauma\nor loss calls for researchers to focus on the negative effects and so\nshapes the data collection. Both studies incorporate values, however\nonly Stewart et al.\u2019s values are explicitly acknowledged and\nself-consciously present and thus, open to empirical scrutiny.\n\nAnderson evaluates Stewart et al.\u2019s work as better science\nbecause it is more empirically adequate.\n\nShe argues that since Stewart\u2019s conception of divorce allows for\nboth negative and positive experiences to count as evidence of the\neffects of divorce, the way Stewart\u2019s team conceptualizes\ndivorce as an object of inquiry allows for a consideration of all of\nthe evidence. Wallerstein and Kelly\u2019s research focuses only on\nthe negative effects and consequently is less empirically adequate.\nThus Anderson argues that in this case the feminist values\nincorporated into the research produce more empirically adequate, and\nhence better, science. Anderson also notes that because the values in\nWallerstein and Kelly\u2019s account are not explicitly identified\nthey are not open to empirical examination. They are consequently held\ndogmatically, whereas Stewart et al.\u2019s are explicit and so open\nto empirical test. In this way, she argues that values are not\nproblematic for science per se, but become problematic when\nheld dogmatically.\n\nSharyn Clough also argues for a legitimate role for values in science,\ncontending that they are subject to the same sort of empirical\nevidence that other beliefs are. She takes Donald Davidson\u2019s\naccount of belief formation as her starting point. For Clough,\n\u201csome political claims (e.g., feminist claims) are better\nsupported by empirical evidence than others\u201d (2003b: 4). Sexist\nand racist values, for example, are not well-supported by evidence and\nhence science that is sexist and racist is clearly not good science\n(Clough 2003a; Clough & Loges 2008).\n\nClough agrees with Anderson that feminist values can improve science\nand offers an illustration in her analysis of research on the hygiene\nhypothesis\u2014the hypothesis that increased levels of concern about\nsanitation and the consequent decrease in exposure to micro-organisms\nand pathogens is causally related to increasing rates of auto-immune\ndisease and allergies, particularly in the industrialized nations of\nthe North and West (Clough 2011, 2012). Clough explores this case from\na feminist perspective noting some additional data related to\ngender\u2014the affected populations (those suffering from allergies\nand auto-immune diseases) include a disproportionate representation of\nwomen and girls. Clough argues that the additional information that\ngender norms in the most severely affected societies generally require\nhigher standards of cleanliness for girls than for boys is\nevidentially relevant since research shows that increased\nexposure to microbes in childhood increases immunity to pathogens in\nadulthood. Since early exposure to pathogens may decrease the\nincidence of allergies and auto-immune diseases, the higher incidence\nof these conditions among girls and women in cultures where the they\nare subject to stricter norms of cleanliness is predicted by the\nhygiene hypothesis. Thus this correlation can provide additional\nevidence for the hypothesis when gender is taken into consideration.\nAdopting the minimal feminist value that gender matters improves\nresearch in this case. These values increase the empirical adequacy of\nthe account and thus improve the science.\n\nFor both Anderson and Clough the values incorporated into the science\nin this way are subject to empirical test as part of the theory as a\nwhole. Since the research relies on those values, when the evidence\nsupports the account as superior, it also confirms the values the\naccount incorporates. The objectivity of science is not threatened by\nthe inclusion of values since the account as a whole is still subject\nto empirical evidence.\n\nFeminist radical empiricist holist accounts such as Anderson\u2019s\nand Clough\u2019s present challenges however. Solomon questions\nwhether any single approach to values will be able to provide an\naccount of the varied ways that they can function appropriately in\nscience. She argues that values are not all of one type and\nconsequently, when relevant (and she notes that they may not always be\nrelevant) they may be relevant in different ways, playing different\nroles in knowledge production (Solomon 2012: 446). Audrey Yap worries\nthat some values may not be sensitive to evidence in the ways that\nAnderson\u2019s and Clough\u2019s accounts would seem to require\n(Yap 2016). Other feminist empiricist approaches, such as Helen\nLongino\u2019s contextual empiricism discussed briefly in the next\nsection, may avoid these concerns.\n",
