    "main_text": "Diachronic Identity Puzzles\n4. Diachronic Identity Puzzles\n\nIn the introduction we encountered one type of puzzle about identity\nacross time: the case of Cup and Tcup. The puzzle arose because we\nenvisaged Cup losing one of its parts, and coming to have the same\nmaterial constitution (being, for example, composed of exactly the\nsame atoms as), and spatial boundaries as Tcup. Call this the cup\ncase. Let us say that a and b are coincident at a\ntime t just in case the following holds. Something is a\nproper part of a at t if and only if it is a proper\npart of b at that same time. Cup and Tcup are coincident at\nthe later time since something at that later time is, for example, and\natomic part of a if and only if it is an atomic part of\nb.\n\nThere are cases that pose similar diachronic identity puzzles that do\nnot involve change of parts. One of the best known involves a lump of\nclay which, at an earlier time, is coincident with a statue, but, at a\nlater, say as a result of deformation, is just a shapeless lump of\nclay. Other much discussed cases of putatively distinct things at one\ntime being coincident at another involve fission or fusion. One of the\nmost famous examples of a fission case is provided by the ship of\nTheseus. Over a long period all of the planks composing a certain ship\nare replaced one by one. Eventually a ship indiscernible from the\noriginal, but composed of entirely different planks, results. Call\nthat later ship Replacement. As each plank is removed from the\noriginal ship it is used to construct a ship that is constituted from\nall and only the planks belonging to the original ship. Call the ship\ncomposed of the same planks as the ones initially composing the\noriginal ship Reassembly.\n\nIdentity is, very plausibly, an equivalence relation (see\n Section 2.2).\n One consequence of it being an equivalence relation is that it is\nsubject to transitivity: the principle that if aRb and\nbRc, then aRc. Saying that, in the case of Theseus'\nship, Replacement and Reassembly are both identical with the original\nship putatively conflicts with the transitivity of identity since\nReplacement seems to be later clearly distinct from Reassembly.\n\nWhat is the best account of these cases? Here are some of the major\nones on offer:\n",
