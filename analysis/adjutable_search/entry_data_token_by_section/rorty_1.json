    "main_text": "Against Epistemology\n2. Against Epistemology\n\nOn Rorty\u2019s account, modern epistemology is not only an attempt\nto legitimate our claim to knowledge of what is real, but also an\nattempt to legitimate philosophical reflection itself \u2013 a\npressing task, on many accounts, once the advent of the so-called\nnew science of the sixteenth and seventeenth century\ngradually gave content to a notion of knowledge obtained by the\nmethodological interrogation of nature itself. Because the result of\nthis kind of interrogation, theoretical empirical knowledge, is so\nobviously fruitful, and also carries with it seemingly uncontentious\nnorms of progress, its mere presence poses a legitimation challenge to\na form of thought, and claim to knowledge, that is distinct from it.\nCartesian epistemology, in Rorty\u2019s picture, is designed to meet\nthis challenge. It is sceptical in a fundamental way; sceptical doubts\nof a Cartesian sort, that is, doubts that can be raised about any set\nof empirical claims whatever, and so cannot be alleviated by\nexperience, are tailor-made to preserve at once a domain and a job for\nphilosophical reflection. Rorty\u2019s aim in PMN is to undermine the\nassumptions in light of which this double legitimation project makes\nsense.\n",
