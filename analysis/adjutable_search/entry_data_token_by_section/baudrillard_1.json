Symbolic Exchange and the Postmodern Break\n\nThe Mirror of Production and his next book Symbolic\nExchange and Death (1976), a major text finally translated in\n1993, are attempts to provide ultraradical perspectives that overcome\nthe limitations of an economistic Marxist tradition that privileges the\neconomic sphere. This ultra-leftist phase of Baudrillard\u2019s\nitinerary would be short-lived, however, though in Symbolic\nExchange and Death, Baudrillard produces one of his most important\nand dramatic provocations. The text opens with a Preface that condenses\nhis attempt to provide a significantly different approach to society\nand culture. Building on the French cultural theory of Georges\nBataille, Marcel Mauss, and Alfred Jarry, he champions \u201csymbolic\nexchange\u201d which resists capitalist values of utility and monetary\nprofit for cultural values. Baudrillard argues that in Bataille\u2019s\nclaim that expenditure and excess is connected with sovereignty,\nMauss\u2019s descriptions of the social prestige of gift-giving in\npremodern society, Jarry\u2019s theater that ridicules French culture,\nand Saussure\u2019s anagrams, there is a break with the values of\ncapitalist exchange and production, or the production of meaning in\nlinguistic exchange. These cases of \u201csymbolic exchange,\u201d\nBaudrillard believes, break with the values of production and describe\npoetic exchange and creative cultural activity that provides\nalternatives to the capitalist values of production and exchange.\n\n\nThe term \u201csymbolic exchange\u201d was derived from Georges\nBataille\u2019s notion of a \u201cgeneral economy\u201d where\nexpenditure, waste, sacrifice, and destruction were claimed to be more\nfundamental to human life than economies of production and utility\n(1988 [1967]). Bataille\u2019s model was the sun that freely expended\nits energy without asking anything in return. He argued that if\nindividuals wanted to be truly sovereign (e.g., free from the\nimperatives of capitalism) they should pursue a \u201cgeneral\neconomy\u201d of expenditure, giving, sacrifice, and destruction to\nescape determination by existing imperatives of utility.\n\n\nFor Bataille, human beings were beings of excess with\nexorbitant energy, fantasies, drives, needs, and heterogeneous desire.\nAt this point, Baudrillard presupposes the truth of Bataille\u2019s\nanthropology and general economy. In a 1976 review of a volume of\nBataille\u2019s Complete Works, Baudrillard writes:\n\u201cThe central idea is that the economy which governs our societies\nresults from a misappropriation of the fundamental human principle,\nwhich is a solar principle of expenditure\u201d (1987: 57). In the\nearly 1970s, Baudrillard took over Bataille\u2019s anthropological\nposition and what he calls Bataille\u2019s \u201caristocratic\ncritique\u201d of capitalism that he now claims is grounded in the\ncrass notions of utility and savings rather than the more sublime\n\u201caristocratic\u201d notion of excess and expenditure. Bataille\nand Baudrillard presuppose here a contradiction between human nature\nand capitalism. They maintain that humans \u201cby nature\u201d gain\npleasure from such things as expenditure, waste, festivities,\nsacrifices, and so on, in which they are sovereign and free to expend\nthe excesses of their energy (and thus to follow their \u201creal\nnature\u201d). The capitalist imperatives of labor, utility, and\nsavings by implication are \u201cunnatural,\u201d and go against\nhuman nature.\n\n\nBaudrillard argues that the Marxian critique of capitalism, by\ncontrast, merely attacks exchange value while exalting use value and\nthus utility and instrumental rationality, thereby \u201cseeking a\ngood use of the economy.\u201d For Baudrillard:\n\n\n\nMarxism is therefore only a limited petit bourgeois critique, one\nmore step in the banalization of life toward the \u2018good use\u2019\nof the social! Bataille, to the contrary, sweeps away all this slave\ndialectic from an aristocratic point of view, that of the master\nstruggling with his death. One can accuse this perspective of being\npre- or post-Marxist. At any rate, Marxism is only the disenchanted\nhorizon of capital \u2014 all that precedes or follows it is more\nradical than it is (1987: 60).\n\n\n\nThis passage is highly revealing and marks Baudrillard\u2019s\nswitch to an \u201caristocratic critique\u201d of political economy\ndeeply influenced by Bataille and Nietzsche. For Bataille and\nBaudrillard are presenting a version of Nietzsche\u2019s aristocratic\n\u201cmaster morality\u201d where \u201csuperior\u201d individuals\ncreate their own values and their life articulates an excess, overflow,\nand intensification of creative and erotic energies. Nietzsche was a\nmajor\n influence[5]\nthroughout\nBaudrillard\u2019s life and, especially in the last decades of his\nwork, Nietzschean motifs, modes of thought, and writing practices\nincreasingly informed his work. Baudrillard became increasingly radical\nand \u201cun-contemporary,\u201d standing alone against current\ntrends and fashions, in a fiercely individualistic mode of thought.\nNietzschean categories like fate, reversal, uncertainty, and an\naristocratic assault on conventional wisdom began to shape his\nwritings, that often, a la Nietzsche, took the form of aphorisms or\nshort essays.\n\n\nFor some time, Baudrillard would continue to attack the bourgeoisie,\ncapital, and political economy, but from a perspective which champions\n\u201caristocratic\u201d expenditure and sumptuary, aesthetic and\nsymbolic values. The dark side of his switch in theoretical and\npolitical allegiances is a valorization of (i.e., a giving or\nassigning of value to) sacrifice and death that informs Symbolic\nExchange and Death (in which sacrifice provides a giving that\nsubverts bourgeois values of utility and self-preservation, an idea\nthat has sinister implications in an era of suicide bombings and\nterrorism).\n\n\nOn the whole, in his mid-1970s work, Baudrillard was extricating\nhimself from the familiar Marxian universe of production and class\nstruggle into a quite different neo-aristocratic and metaphysical\nworld-view. Baudrillard seems to assume at this point that\npre-capitalist societies were governed by forms of symbolic exchange\nsimilar to Bataille\u2019s notion of a general economy. Influenced by\nMauss\u2019 theory of the gift and countergift, Baudrillard claimed\nthat pre-capitalist societies were governed by laws of symbolic\nexchange rather than production and utility. Developing these ideas,\nBaudrillard sketched a fundamental dividing line in history between\nsymbolic societies \u2014 i.e., societies fundamentally organized\naround premodern exchange \u2014 and productivist societies (i.e.,\nsocieties organized around production and commodity exchange). He thus\nrejects the Marxian philosophy of history which posits the primacy of\nproduction in all societies and rejects the Marxian concept of\nsocialism, arguing that it does not break radically enough with\ncapitalist productivism, offering itself merely as a more efficient and\nequitable organization of production rather than as a completely\ndifferent sort of society with a different values and forms of culture\nand life.\n\n\nHenceforth, Baudrillard would contrast \u2014 in one way or another\n\u2014 his ideal of symbolic exchange to the values of production,\nutility, and instrumental rationality that govern capitalist (and\nsocialist) societies. \u201cSymbolic exchange\u201d thus emerges as\nBaudrillard\u2019s \u201crevolutionary\u201d alternative to the\nvalues and practices of capitalist society, and stands for a variety of\nheterogeneous activities in his 1970s writings. For instance, he writes\nin the Critique: \u201cThe exchange of looks, the present\nwhich comes and goes, are like the air people breathe in and out. This\nis the metabolism of exchange, prodigality, festival \u2014 and also\nof destruction (which returns to non-value what production has erected,\nvalorized). In this domain, value isn\u2019t even recognized\u201d\n(1981: 207). He also describes his conception of symbolic exchange in\nThe Mirror of Production where he writes: \u201cThe symbolic\nsocial relation is the uninterrupted cycle of giving and receiving,\nwhich, in primitive exchange, includes the consumption of the\n\u2018surplus\u2019 and deliberate anti-production\u201d (1975:\n143). The term therefore refers to symbolic or cultural activities\nwhich do not contribute to capitalist production and accumulation and\nwhich potentially constitute a \u201cradical negation\u201d of\nproductivist society.\n\n\nAt this stage of his thought, Baudrillard stood in a French\ntradition of extolling \u201cprimitive\u201d or premodern culture\nover the abstract rationalism and utilitarianism of modern society. His\ndefense of symbolic exchange over production and instrumental\nrationality thus stands in the tradition of Rousseau\u2019s defense of\nthe \u201cnatural savage\u201d over modern man, Durkheim\u2019s\nposing mechanical solidarities of premodern societies against the\nabstract individualism and anomie of modern ones, Bataille\u2019s\nvalorization of expenditure of premodern societies, or Mauss\u2019 or\nLevi-Strauss\u2019 fascination with the richness of \u201cprimitive\nsocieties\u201d or \u201cthe savage mind.\u201d After deconstructing\nthe modern master thinkers and his own theoretical fathers (Marx,\nFreud, Saussure, and his French contemporaries) for missing the\nrichness of symbolic exchange, Baudrillard continues to champion the\nsymbolic and radical forms of thought and writing in a quest that takes\nhim into ever more esoteric and exotic discourse.\n\n\nThus, against the organizing forms of modern thought and society,\nBaudrillard champions symbolic exchange as an alternative. Against\nmodern demands to produce value and meaning, he calls for their\nextermination and annihilation, providing as examples, Mauss\u2019s\ngift-exchange, Saussure\u2019s anagrams, and Freud\u2019s concept of\nthe death drive. In all of these instances, there is a rupture with the\nforms of exchange (of goods, meanings, and libidinal energies) and thus\nan escape from the forms of production, capitalism, rationality, and\nmeaning. Baudrillard\u2019s paradoxical concept of symbolic exchange\ncan be explained as expression of a desire to liberate himself from\nmodern positions and to seek a revolutionary position outside of modern\nsociety. Against modern values, he advocates their annihilation and\nextermination.\n\n\nIn 1970s like Baudrillard posits another divide in history as\nradical as the rupture between premodern symbolic societies and modern\nones. In the mode of classical social theory, he systematically\ndevelops distinctions between premodern societies organized around\nsymbolic exchange, modern societies organized around production, and\npostmodern societies organized around \u201csimulation\u201d by which\nhe means the cultural modes of representation that\n\u201csimulate\u201d reality as in television, computer cyberspace,\nand virtual reality. Baudrillard\u2019s distinction between the mode\nof production and utility that organized modern societies and the mode\nof simulation that he believes is the organizing form of postmodern\nsocieties postulates a rupture between modern and postmodern societies\nas great as the divide between modern and premodern ones. In theorizing\nthe epochal postmodern rupture with modernity, he declares the\n\u201cend of political economy\u201d and of an era in which\nproduction was the organizing form of society. Following Marx, he\nargues that this modern epoch was the era of capitalism and the\nbourgeoisie, in which workers were exploited by capital and provided a\nrevolutionary force of upheaval. Baudrillard, however, declared the end\nof political economy and thus the end of the Marxist problematic and of\nmodernity itself:\n\n\n\nThe end of labor. The end of production. The end of political\neconomy. The end of the signifier/signified dialectic which facilitates\nthe accumulation of knowledge and of meaning, the linear syntagma of\ncumulative discourse. And at the same time, the end simultaneously of\nthe exchange value/use value dialectic which is the only thing that\nmakes accumulation and social production possible. The end of linear\ndimension of discourse. The end of the linear dimension of the\ncommodity. The end of the classical era of the sign. The end of the era\nof production (Baudrillard 1993a: 8).\n\n\n\nThe discourse of \u201cthe end\u201d signifies his announcing a\npostmodern break or rupture in history. People are now, Baudrillard\nclaims, in a new era of simulation in which social reproduction\n(information processing, communication, and knowledge industries, and\nso on) replaces production as the organizing form of society. In this\nera, labor is no longer a force of production but is itself a\n\u201cone sign amongst many\u201d (1993a: 10). Labor is not\nprimarily productive in this situation, but is a sign of one\u2019s\nsocial position, way of life, and mode of servitude. Wages too bear no\nrational relation to one\u2019s work and what one produces but to\none\u2019s place within the system (1993a: 19ff.). But, crucially,\npolitical economy is no longer the foundation, the social determinant,\nor even a structural \u201creality\u201d in which other phenomena can\nbe interpreted and explained (31ff.). Instead people live in the\n\u201chyperreality\u201d of simulations in which images, spectacles,\nand the play of signs replace the concepts of production and class\nconflict as key constituents of contemporary societies.\n\n\nFrom now on, capital and political economy disappear from\nBaudrillard\u2019s story, or return in radically new forms.\nHenceforth, signs and codes proliferate and produce other signs and new\nsign machines in ever-expanding and spiraling cycles. Technology thus\nreplaces capital in this story and semiurgy (interpreted by Baudrillard\nas proliferation of images, information, and signs) replaces\nproduction. His postmodern turn is thus connected to a form of\ntechnological determinism and a rejection of political economy as a\nuseful explanatory principle \u2014 a move that many of his critics\nreject (see Kellner 1989, Norris 1992, and the studies in Kellner\n1994).\n\nSymbolic Exchange and Death and the succeeding studies in\nSimulation and Simulacra (1994 [1981]) articulate the\nprinciple of a fundamental rupture between modern and postmodern\nsocieties and mark Baudrillard\u2019s departure from the problematic\nof modern social theory. For him, modern societies are organized around\nthe production and consumption of commodities, while postmodern\nsocieties are organized around simulation and the play of\nimages and signs, denoting a situation in which codes, models, and\nsigns are the organizing forms of a new social order where\nsimulation\n rules.[6]\nIn the society of\nsimulation, identities are constructed by the appropriation of images,\nand codes and models determine how individuals perceive themselves and\nrelate to other people. Economics, politics, social life, and culture\nare all governed by the mode of simulation, whereby codes and models\ndetermine how goods are consumed and used, politics unfold, culture is\nproduced and consumed, and everyday life is lived.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s postmodern world is also one in which previously\nimportant boundaries and distinctions \u2014 such as those between\nsocial classes, genders, political leanings, and once autonomous realms\nof society and culture \u2014 lose power. If modern societies, for\nclassical social theory, were characterized by differentiation, for\nBaudrillard, postmodern societies are characterized by\ndedifferentiation, the \u201ccollapse\u201d of (the power of)\ndistinctions, or implosion. In his society of simulation, the\nrealms of economics, politics, culture, sexuality, and the social all\nimplode into each other. In this implosive mix, economics is\nfundamentally shaped by culture, politics, and other spheres, while\nart, once a sphere of potential difference and opposition, is absorbed\ninto the economic and political, while sexuality is everywhere. In this\nsituation, differences between individuals and groups implode in a\nrapidly mutating or changing dissolution of the social and the previous\nboundaries and structures upon which social theory had once\nfocused.\n\n\nIn addition, his postmodern universe is one of hyperreality\nin which entertainment, information, and communication technologies\nprovide experiences more intense and involving than the scenes of banal\neveryday life, as well as the codes and models that structure everyday\nlife. The realm of the hyperreal (e.g., media simulations of reality,\nDisneyland and amusement parks, malls and consumer fantasylands, TV\nsports, virtual reality games, social networking sites, and other\nexcursions into ideal worlds) is more real than real, whereby the\nmodels, images, and codes of the hyperreal come to control thought and\nbehavior. Yet determination itself is aleatory in a non-linear world\nwhere it is impossible to chart causal mechanisms in a situation in\nwhich individuals are confronted with an overwhelming flux of images,\ncodes, and models, any of which may shape an individual\u2019s thought\nor behavior.\n\n\nIn this postmodern world, individuals flee from the \u201cdesert of\nthe real\u201d for the ecstasies of hyperreality and the new realm of\ncomputer, media, and technological experience. In this universe,\nsubjectivities are fragmented and lost, and a new terrain of experience\nappears that for Baudrillard renders previous social theories and\npolitics obsolete and irrelevant. Tracing the vicissitudes of the\nsubject in present-day society, Baudrillard claims that contemporary\nsubjects are no longer afflicted with modern pathologies like hysteria\nor paranoia. Rather, they exist in \u201ca state of terror which is\ncharacteristic of the schizophrenic, an over-proximity of all things, a\nfoul promiscuity of all things which beleaguer and penetrate him,\nmeeting with no resistance, and no halo, no aura, not even the aura of\nhis own body protects him. In spite of himself the schizophrenic is\nopen to everything and lives in the most extreme confusion\u201d\n(1988: 27). For Baudrillard, the \u201cecstasy of communication\u201d\nmeans that the subject is in close proximity to instantaneous images\nand information, in an overexposed and transparent world. In this\nsituation, the subject \u201cbecomes a pure screen a pure absorption\nand re-absorption surface of the influent networks\u201d (1988: 27).\nIn other words, an individual in a postmodern world becomes merely an\nentity influenced by media, technological experience, and the\nhyperreal.\n\n\nThus, Baudrillard\u2019s categories of simulation, implosion, and\nhyperreality combine to create an emergent postmodern condition that\nrequires entirely new modes of theory and politics to chart and respond\nto the novelties of the contemporary era. His style and writing\nstrategies are also implosive (i.e., working against previously\nimportant distinctions), combining material from strikingly different\nfields, studded with examples from the mass media and popular culture\nin an innovative mode of postmodern theory that does not respect\ndisciplinary boundaries. His writing attempts to itself simulate the\nnew conditions, capturing its novelties through inventive use of\nlanguage and theory. Such radical questioning of contemporary theory\nand the need for new theoretical strategies are thus legitimated for\nBaudrillard by the large extent of changes in the current era.\n\n\nFor instance, Baudrillard claims that modernity operates with a mode\nof representation in which ideas represent reality and truth, concepts\nthat are key postulates of modern theory. A postmodern society explodes\nthis epistemology by creating a situation in which subjects lose\ncontact with the real and fragment and dissolve. This situation\nportends the end of modern theory that operated with a subject-object\ndialectic in which the subject was supposed to represent and control\nthe object. In the story of modern philosophy, the philosophic subject\nattempts to discern the nature of reality, to secure grounded\nknowledge, and to apply this knowledge to control and dominate the\nobject (e.g., nature, other people, ideas, and so on). Baudrillard\nfollows here the poststructuralist critique that thought and discourse\ncould no longer be securely anchored in a priori or privileged\nstructures of \u201cthe real.\u201d Reacting against the mode of\nrepresentation in modern theory, French thought, especially some\ndeconstructionists (Rorty\u2019s \u201cstrong textualists\u201d),\nmoved into the play of textuality, of discourse, which allegedly\nreferred only to other texts or discourses in which \u201cthe\nreal\u201d or an \u201coutside\u201d were banished to the realm of\nnostalgia.\n\n\nIn a similar fashion, Baudrillard, a \u201cstrong\nsimulacrist,\u201d claims that in the media and consumer society,\npeople are caught up in the play of images, spectacles, and simulacra,\nthat have less and less relationship to an outside, to an external\n\u201creality,\u201d to such an extent that the very concepts of the\nsocial, political, or even \u201creality\u201d no longer seem to have\nany meaning. And the narcoticized and mesmerized (some of\nBaudrillard\u2019s metaphors) media-saturated consciousness is in such\na state of fascination with image and spectacle that the concept of\nmeaning itself (which depends on stable boundaries, fixed structures,\nshared consensus) dissolves. In this alarming and novel postmodern\nsituation, the referent, the behind and the outside, along with depth,\nessence, and reality all disappear, and with their disappearance, the\npossibility of all potential opposition vanishes as well. As\nsimulations proliferate, they come to refer only to themselves: a\ncarnival of mirrors reflecting images projected from other mirrors onto\nthe omnipresent television and computer screen and the screen of\nconsciousness, which in turn refers the image to its previous\nstorehouse of images also produced by simulatory mirrors. Caught up in\nthe universe of simulations, the \u201cmasses\u201d are \u201cbathed\nin a media massage\u201d without messages or meaning, a mass age where\nclasses disappear, and politics is dead, as are the grand dreams of\ndisalienation, liberation, and revolution.\n\n\nBaudrillard claims that henceforth the masses seek spectacle and not\nmeaning. They implode into a \u201csilent majority,\u201d signifying\n\u201cthe end of the social\u201d (1983b). Baudrillard implies that\nsocial theory loses its very object as meanings, classes, and\ndifference implode into a \u201cblack hole\u201d of\nnon-differentiation. Fixed distinctions between social groupings and\nideologies implode and concrete face-to-face social relations recede as\nindividuals disappear in worlds of simulation \u2014 media, computers,\nvirtual reality itself. Social theory itself thus loses its object, the\nsocial, while radical politics loses its subject and agency.\n\n\nNonetheless, he claims, at this point in his trajectory (i.e., the\nlate 1970s and early 1980s) that refusal of meaning and participation\nby the masses is a form of resistance. Hovering between nostalgia and\nnihilism, Baudrillard at once exterminates modern ideas (e.g., the\nsubject, meaning, truth, reality, society, socialism, and emancipation)\nand affirms a mode of symbolic exchange which appears to manifest a\nnostalgic desire to return to premodern cultural forms. This desperate\nsearch for a genuinely revolutionary alternative was abandoned,\nhowever, by the early 1980s. Henceforth, he develops yet more novel\nperspectives on the contemporary moment, vacillating between sketching\nout alternative modes of thought and behavior and renouncing the quest\nfor political and social change.\n\n\nIn a sense, there is a parodic inversion of historical materialism\nin Baudrillard. In place of Marx\u2019s emphasis on political economy\nand the primacy of the economic, for Baudrillard it is the model, the\nsuperstructure, that generates the real in a situation he refers to as\nthe \u201cend of political economy\u201d (1993a). For Baudrillard,\nsign values predominate over use values and exchange values; the\nmateriality of needs and commodity use-values to serve them disappear\nin Baudrillard\u2019s semiological imaginary, in which signs take\nprecedence over the real and reconstruct human life. Turning the\nMarxist categories against themselves, masses absorb classes, the\nsubject of praxis is fractured, and objects come to rule human beings.\nRevolution is absorbed by the object of critique and technological\nimplosion replaces the socialist revolution in producing a rupture in\nhistory. For Baudrillard, in contrast to Marx, the catastrophe of\nmodernity and eruption of postmodernity is produced by the unfolding of\ntechnological revolution. Consequently, Baudrillard replaces\nMarx\u2019s hard economic and social determinism with its emphasis on\nthe economic dimension, class struggle, and human praxis, with a form\nof semiological idealism and technological determinism where signs and\nobjects come to dominate the subject.\n\n\nBaudrillard thus concludes that the \u201ccatastrophe has\nhappened,\u201d that the destruction of modernity and modern theory\nwhich he noted in the mid-1970s, has been completed by the development\nof capitalist society itself, that modernity has disappeared and a new\nsocial situation has taken its place. Against traditional strategies of\nrebellion and revolution, Baudrillard begins to champion what he calls\n\u201cfatal strategies\u201d that push the values of the system to\nthe extreme in the hopes of collapse or reversal, and eventually adopts\na style of highly ironic metaphysical discourse that renounces\nemancipation and the discourse and hopes of progressive social\ntransformation.\n",
