In glossing\nthe [AK] 6.4 verse his commentary explains that ultimate reality is\nregarded as ultimately existent, one that is both physically and\nlogically irreducible. Vasubandhu supplies three arguments to support\nthis: (i) ultimate reality is both physically and logically\nirreducible, as it does not disintegrate when it is subjected to\nphysical destruction and that its identity does not disappear when its\nparts are separated from it under logical analysis; and (ii) ultimate\nreality does not borrow its nature from other things including its\nparts. Rather it exists independently in virtue of its intrinsic\nreality (svabh\u0101va), the exclusion of its parts thus does\nnot affect its inherent nature; and (iii) it is not a product of\nmental constructions, like that of conventionally real wholes,\ncausation, continuum etc. It exists intrinsically ([AKB] 6.4,\nMngon pa khu 214a).\n\nUltimate reality is of two types: the compounded\n(sa\u1e41sk\u1e5bta) ultimate, and the uncompounded\n(asa\u1e41sk\u1e5bta) ultimate. The uncompounded ultimate consists\nof (a) space (ak\u0101\u015ba), and (b)\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014analytical cessation\n(pratisa\u1e41ky\u0101-nirodha) and non-analytical cessation\n(apratisa\u1e41khy\u0101-nirodha). These three ultimates are\nuncompounded as each is seen as being causally unconditioned. They are\nnonspatial concepts. These concepts do not have any physical referent\nwhatsoever. Space is a mere absence of entity. Analytical and\nnonanalytical cessations are the two forms of nirv\u0101\u1e47a,\nwhich is simply freedom from afflictive suffering, or the elimination\nof afflictive suffering. These concepts are not associated in positing\nany thing that can be described as remotely physical. They are thus\nthe concepts that are irreducible physically and logically.\n\nThe compounded ultimate consists of the five aggregates\u2014material\naggregate (r\u016bpa), feeling aggregate (vedan\u0101),\nperception-aggregate (sa\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101), dispositional\naggregate (sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra), and consciousness-aggregate\n(vij\u00f1\u0101na)\u2014since they are causally produced, and the\nideas of each aggregate are conceived individually rather than\ncollectively. If the aggregates, the ideas of which are conceived\ncollectively as a whole(s) or a continuum/continua, they could not be\nultimately real. The collective concepts of the aggregate as a\n\u201cwhole\u201d or as a \u201ccontinuum\u201d subject to\ncessation as they cease to appear to the mind, get excluded from the\nconceptual framework of the reality of the five aggregates when they\nare logically analysed.\n",
