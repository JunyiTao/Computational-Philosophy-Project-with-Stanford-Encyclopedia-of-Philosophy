    "main_text": "\n\n\nHenry of Ghent (b. 1217?, d. 1293) is perhaps the most prominent\nfigure at the Faculty of Theology in Paris during the last quarter of\nthe 13th century; that is, of the next generation after the\ndeath of Thomas Aquinas. For a long time it was thought that Henry was\na conservative theologian, engaged in the defence of the Augustinian\ntradition against the risks deriving from the spread of\nAristotelianism and Arabic philosophy \u2014 an impression that\nseemed to be confirmed by Henry's participation in the commission set\nup by Bishop Tempier in view of the famous condemnation of March\n1277. However, the progress of the new critical edition of the\nOpera Omnia of Henry \u2014 begun in Leuven by Raymond\nMacken nearly thirty years ago and now coordinated by G.A. Wilson,\nsupported by an international team \u2014 has already demonstrated\nthat this evaluation needs to be substantially revised. Indeed, Henry\nsought to reconcile traditional Augustinian theories with some of the\nbasic principles of Aristotelian epistemology and Avicennian ontology,\nthereby giving rise to a complex and original synthesis.\n",
