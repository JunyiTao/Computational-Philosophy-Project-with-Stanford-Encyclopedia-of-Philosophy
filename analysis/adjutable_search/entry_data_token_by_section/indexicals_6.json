These context-sensitive expressions are sometimes\nsaid to be, or to resemble, indexicals, pronouns, or variables. For\nillustration, consider the gradable adjective \u2018rich\u2019. A\nstrict contextualist theory would claim that this adjective is\na unary predicate whose content in any context is a unary\nproperty. In some contexts, the content of \u2018rich\u2019 is\n(roughly) the property of being rich for a philosopher, while in others\nits content is the property of being rich for the CEO of a large\ncompany. By contrast, an invariantist theory with hidden\nindexicals for \u2018rich\u2019 would claim that the content of\n\u2018rich\u2019 does not vary from context to context: its content,\nin every context, is the same binary relation, roughly\nrich for, that can hold between a person and (roughly) a\nproperty. Sometimes the predicate \u2018rich\u2019 appears in\nsentences in which it has two (linguistic) arguments, as in\n\u2018George is rich for a philosopher\u2019. But in sentences in\nwhich there is no pronounced second argument, as in\n\u2018George is rich\u2019, the predicate \u2018rich\u2019 is\naccompanied by an unpronounced occurrence of a context-sensitive\nexpression that resembles a pronoun. In some contexts, the content of\nthe hidden indexical is the property of being a philosopher and in\nothers it is the property of being a CEO of a large company. See Partee\n(1989), Condoravdi and Gawron (1996), Stanley and Szabo 2000.\n\n\nA third type of theory for \u2018rich\u2019 is an invariantist\ntheory with unarticulated constituents (Perry 2000, Chapter\n10). On such views, \u2018rich\u2019 is a binary predicate whose\ncontent in all contexts is the previously mentioned binary relation\nrich for, but the word is never accompanied by a hidden\nindexical. Thus the content of the sentence \u2018George is\nrich\u2019, in all contexts, is less than fully propositional.\nHowever, according to some views of this sort, a speaker who utters\nthat sentence typically asserts a full proposition, such as the\nproposition that George is rich for a philosopher. For discussion, see\nBach 1994, 2005.\n",
