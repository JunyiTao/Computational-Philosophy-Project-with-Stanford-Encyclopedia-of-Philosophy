    "main_text": "Piety and Ethics\n6. Piety and Ethics\n\n\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s writings as a rule deal exclusively with speculative\nmatters. Two recently published treatises, however, give equal weight\nto praxis, in line with the pairing of \u2018ilm and\n\u2019amal (knowledge and practice) that appears in the title of\nthe longer work; this pairing was widespread among Sufis but by no\nmeans limited to them alone. Ibn Kammuna usually identifies the reader\nof these tracts as an \u2018\u0101qil, literally someone who employs\nhis intellect; this too is quite common. Other expressions he uses to\ndescribe his audience are \u201cseeker of perfection\u201d and\n\u201cseeker of salvation (najat) and perfection.\u201d\n\n\nThe speculative philosophy expressed in these writings is in keeping\nwith the views that Ibn Kammuna expresses elsewhere. However, he has\nin mind here a very particular type of \u2018ilm;\n\u201ctrue\u201d \u2018ilm is not, as he tells us, what people\ngenerally think. Rather, it is self-knowledge: knowledge of one\u2019s own\nshortcomings, and of one\u2019s obligations to worship God. Knowledge of\nthis sort is goal directed; it serves to weaken one\u2019s\nconnections or involvement in this world, and to produce a concomitant\nintensification of one\u2019s inclination towards the other world. The\nsections on\n\u2019amal, which urge an ethical program steeped in piety, reveal\na side to Ibn Kammuna that has not been mentioned, let alone\nadequately explored, in the scholarly literature to date. The\nfollowing paragraphs are an attempt to bring to the fore some salient\npoints. We shall offer some suggestions towards contextualization,\nwhich are necessarily tentative and preliminary.\n\n\nThe tension-free concord between reasoned, independently verifiable\nknowledge and knowledge based on revelation and tradition (science and\nfaith, to put it more simply) manifest in these writings is noteworthy.\nIbn Kammuna raises none of the ostensible contradictions that so\ntroubled Ibn Sina, al-Ghazali, and Maimonides. A series of generally\nfacile arguments are given for the existence of God and his attributes.\nIn general, the conception of the deity is informed more by His\ngoodness and bounty than it is by His power and judgment.\n\n\nConsistent with the concerns so prominent in his other writings, Ibn\nKammuna devotes a great deal of space (half of part one of the Kalimat, which deals with \u2018ilm, whose meaning in\nthis text has been described two paragraphs above) to the human soul\n(nafs; the meaning of this term in this text has been given\nabove, section II), its quasi-divine nature, and its survival after\ndeath. His discourse on these issues is philosophical. In the second\npart of this treatise, however, Ibn Kammuna shifts to a Sufi mode of\nexposition. In keeping with Sufi notions, he emphasizes the key,\ncritical role of the qalb, literally \u201cheart\u201d, as\nthe epicenter of human goodness. However, he does not adopt the very\ncommon Sufi opposition of nafs, \u201csoul\u201d, to\nqalb, where the former stands for passions and bad moral\ntraits. Instead, he defines qalb as \u201cthe eye of\nnafs. (\u201dEye\u201c in this context has much the same\nmeaning as it has in the English phrase, \u201dthe eye of the\nstorm\u201c).\u201d\n\n\nBoth treatises display a thorough integration of religious and\nphilosophical ideas and ideals. As Ibn Kammuna writes at the beginning\nof the Kalimat: \u201cThe masters of traditional religions\nand of intellectual tenets agree that salvation and eternal felicity\ndepend upon belief in God, the end of days, and doing good\nworks\u201d (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 142). Elsewhere Ibn\nKammuna speaks of \u201cthe people of wisdom and revelation.\u201d\nThe values and ideas expounded in these two works look to represent a\nconsensus that has been reached by these two groups, who, in different\ncircumstances, were thought to be very much at odds with one\nanother. We cannot say as yet how widespread this concordance was as a\nsocial phenomenon. In any event, it was shattered a century later by\nIbn Taymiyya and his followers, who assaulted the\n\u201cforeign\u201d sciences from different angles.\n\n\u2019Amal is definitely subordinate to \u2018ilm; in this\nsense, the pietistic treatises continue the strong scientific\norientation evident in all of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s writings. However, praxis\nis by no means a concession to the low intellectual level of the\nmasses, as it is often thought to be in \u201cpolitical\u201d\nconceptions of religion; nor is it merely a device to restrain bodily\ndrives. Praxis and science reinforce each other in a specific way:\n\u201cFrom the states of the limbs, lights ascend forth to the\nqalb, just as from the gnoses (ma\u2018arif) of the\nqalb, lights descend to the limbs. This is the secret of the\nelevation of souls by means of bodily devotions\u201d (Pourjavady\n& Schmidtke 2006, 161). There is thus a distinct and immediate\nspiritual reward for praxis, even for\u2014perhaps especially\nfor\u2014the enlightened.\n\n\nThe Kalimat is dedicated to a Muslim patron, and it easily\nand naturally reads as a work of Muslim piety. However, on close\ninspection, there is nothing distinctly Muslim about it. Ibn Kammuna\nis driven by the same idea of spirituality and religiosity common to\nMuslims, Jews, Christians, or non-denominational philosophic theists\nof the type described by Judah Hallevi in his Kuzari, a book that Ibn\nKammuna studied closely. It is striking that the only Qur\u2019anic verse\ncited, from the fifty-seventh sura (\u201cIron\u201d, verse\n3) has, at least for its first part (\u201cHe is the first and the\nlast\u2026\u201d), an exact parallel in both the Hebrew and\nChristian bibles.\n\n\nJust how much Jewish ethics, biblical, rabbinic, and medieval, Ibn\nKammuna has included is difficult to determine. Jewish and Islamic\nethics have been intertwined all along; by the thirteenth century, some\nrabbinic ideas had become thoroughly islamicized on the one hand, and,\non the other, Jewish versions of Sufism were well-established. Jews\ncited snippets of the Qur\u2019an as apothegms of universal wisdom, rather\nthan as the scripture of a particular faith\n community.[4] So\nwhen Ibn Kammuna says that \u201cThe beginning (ra\u2019s,\ncf. Hebrew reishit) of wisdom is fear of God,\u201d is he\nconsciously importing the verse from Psalms 111:10? Overall, Ibn\nKammuna appears to have formulated an original \u201cAbrahamic\u201d\nphilosophical piety. Both the philosophical foundations underpinnings\n(concepts of the deity and of humanity) as well as the moral values\nand spiritual exercises, were carefully crafted so as to be acceptable\nto all monotheists .\n7. Shubah\u0101t: Paradoxes, Problems, and Sophistries\n\n\n A number of \u201cproblems\u201d (shubuh\u0101t; the Arabic\nrefers to all forms of obscurities, including what we call paradoxes\nand sophistries) are attributed to Ibn Kammuna. These have challenged\nIranian philosophers in particular from the sixteenth century onwards\n(Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 37\u201351). Some but not all can be\ntraced to known writings of Ibn Kammuna. One of these is the famous\nliar paradox, which Ibn Kammuna discusses in The New Wisdom;\nsome later figures mistakenly thought that Ibn Kammuna had invented\nit. Another, much discussed item is \u201cthe problem of unity\u201d\n(shubhat al-tawh\u0323\u012bd). Especially since Ibn Sina, the deity was\nwidely identified with w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd, \u201cthat whose\nexistence is necessary\u201d; but, as a philosophical category, is\n\u201cnecessary existence\u201d necessarily unique?  Muslim and\nJewish thinkers would certainly want it to be so, but proving this\npoint was no simple matter. At one place Ibn Kammuna argues from the\ninterconnectedness of all reality, which implies that a single\n\u201cnecessary existence\u201d must stand at the top of the causal\nchain.  He may have picked this up from Maimonides who noted in his\nGuide of the Perplexed (Part I, Ch. 72) that the unity of\nreality is an important indication for the unity of God. Elsewhere,\nhowever, he chose a more torturous route. Were there more than one\n\u201cnecessary existence\u201d, then, rather than being a unique\nessential characteristic, \u201cnecessary existence\u201d would\nperforce be demoted to the rank of an accident shared by two or more\nbeings. It was this proposal that was debated and criticized by later\nthinkers.\n\n\nAnother \u201cproblem\u201d is a sophistry that ties in with some\nrecondite issues in logic that exercised Ibn Kammuna and his\ncontemporaries, especially conversion by contraposition (Langermann\n2007, 11\u201313). It appears that Ibn Kammuna tried to manipulate the\nsimple observation that creation (h\u0323ud\u016bth al-\u2018alam) is not\ncounterfactual, that is to say, it does not require one to deny\nimmediate reality (al-waqi\u2019, reality or actuality as it\npresents itself here and now), into a formal proof: creation does not\nnecessitate the denial of immediate reality; whatever does not\nnecessitate the denial of immediate reality is immediately real; ergo,\nthe creation of the world is immediately real.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna communicated this \u201cproof\u201d to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, who\nproceeded to uncover its\n fallacies.[5]\nFor example, the contraposed major premise,\n\u201cwhatever does not necessitate the denial of immediate reality is\nimmediately real,\u201d when written in its positive formulation, requires a\nrider: \u201cWhatever is absent from immediate reality (ghayr\nwaqi\u2019, grammatically a positive sentence in Arabic) necessitates\nthe negation of immediate reality, as long as it remains absent from\nimmediate reality.\u201d The rider, however, makes the premise hypothetical,\nand that, in turn, changes the rules as far as conversion is concerned,\nand does not allow the conclusion Ibn Kammuna wishes to draw.\n8. Recent Editions\n\nIt is a common complaint in the field of Islamic philosophy,\nespecially in its post-Avicennan phases, that we lack editions of\nprimary texts; this complaint was voiced in the first version of this\nentry. In the intervening years, not a few editions of writings by Ibn\nKammuna have appeared. Two key texts have been reissued in the\noriginal. Dr Lwiis Saliba has reissued the Tanq\u012bh\u0323 al-Abh\u0323\u0101th\n(Examination the Three Faiths, published by Byblion, in\nByblos, Lebanon 2009; a second printing was made already in 2010) in a\nvolume of nearly 600 pages, provided with a detailed introduction and\ncopious notes, all in Arabic, but with a very good command of academic\npublications in European languages. Simon Bellahsen has published a\nFrench translation of the Examination, including a\ntranslation of portions from the biography in Pourjavady and Schmidtke\n2006: Examen de la critique des trois religions monoth\u00e9istes,\nParis: Vrin, 2012. H.J. Isfahani published a new edition of\nthe New Wisdom, which he chose to give an alternative title,\nKit\u0101b al-K\u0101shif (The Revealor), published jointly by\nthe Iranian Institute of Philosophy and the Institute of Islamic\nStudies of the Free University of Berlin, Tehran 2008.\n\n\n\nOnly a very small portion of the commentary to\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Talwihat was published by Ziai and Alwishah. Now\ntwo editions of the full text have been prepared: a three volume\ndoctoral dissertation by Sayyid H.S. Musawi (Tehran University, 1385\nSolar, 1996/1997) and a three volume publication by N. Habibi (Tehran\n1387 Solar, 2008/2009.) Joep Lameer scoured all three editions and\npublished a thirty page review (2012). He concludes that we are still\nin need of a reliable edition.\n\n\nThese are welcome developments, to be sure, but there is cause for\nfurther reflection. In particular, the arguments advanced by Ibn\nKammuna have as a rule not been taken into account by the editors, who\nmust decide between variants in the manuscripts, or by the critics who\nreview the editions. Simply taking note of variants missed by one or\nmore editor, even if these seem to be significant, is not enough; we\nwould like to see a discussion of sample passages, with full analysis\nof the implications of the different readings. At times there is no\ngrammatical, syntactical, or lexical reason a priori to choose one\nvariant over the other. Without fully understanding the passage in\nquestion, errors may ensue; an example of this given by Langermann\n2009, p. 282. Earlier editions must not be dismissed as worthless\nunless one can provide examples to prove such an extreme\nclaim. Moreover, changing the title of a book in mid-course without\nany justification (all agree, for example, that Ibn Kammuna himself\ngave no title to the work commonly referred to as the New\nWisdom) introduces confusion with no compensatory payoff.
