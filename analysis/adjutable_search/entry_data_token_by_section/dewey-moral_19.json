    "main_text": "Moral Theories: the Good, the Right, the Virtuous || Reflective Morality\n4.4 Reflective Morality\n\nDewey\u2019s accounts of the main types of moral theory fit neatly\ninto his experimentalist account of practical reasoning and value\njudgments. Individuals begin their lives as human societies did\nhistorically: acting on impulse and custom. These modes of conduct,\nbeing unselfconscious and shortsighted, cannot handle all the\nchallenges life poses, and generate problems of their own. Thus arises\nthe need for reflective appraisal of conduct in view of its wider\nconsequences, with the aim of controlling future conduct by means of\nthese appraisals, so as to solve the problems at hand. This practical\nreasoning uses the same general experimental method as theoretical\nreasoning does. We begin with certain given facts: these are our\nimmediate valuings of things by impulse and habit. The data for\nappraisal of these valuings come from the consequences of acting on\nthem, along with the ways we value these consequences. The three types\nof moral theory identify three sources of evidence that bear on our\ncurrent valuings: our desires (which by definition are informed), the\nclaims or demands of other people, and their approvals and\ndisapprovals of our conduct. Traditional philosophical ethics tries to\nerect these sources of evidence into transcendent, authoritative\ncriteria, typically by means of certain idealizing moves (such as\nuniversalization and full information). Dewey argued that the\nsupposedly external, transcendent criteria for appraising conduct\n\u2014 ideals of the good, principles of right, standards of approval\nand disapproval \u2014 should rather be treated as hypotheses, as\ntools for uncovering additional data needed to appraise our valuings.\nThey provide us with standpoints by which we can make ourselves aware\nof a wider set of consequences of our conduct. Ideals of the good\nenable us to take up the standpoint of the prudent and foresighted\nindividual, concerned to harmonize current desires with one another\nand with the self\u2019s future needs and interests. Principles of\nright enable us to take up the standpoint of others who make claims on\nus in light of the impact of our conduct on their interests. Standards\nof approval enable us to take up the standpoint of observers, who\napprove and disapprove of our conduct not just for its consequences\nbut on account of its underlying motives as well. Thus, these norms\nenable us to survey the consequences of our conduct from a first\npersonal, second personal, and third personal point of view,\nrespectively, and to shape new ends (desires) accordingly. But no\nactual ideal, principle, or standard exhaustively captures each point\nof view, since each is subject to further development with further\nextensions of information, imagination, and sympathy. They can only be\naccepted tentatively, as hypotheses to be tested by acting on them and\nseeing what further data they elicit. Some of this data \u2014 new\nregrets, new complaints, new disapprovals \u2014 will disconfirm our\nhypotheses and provide grounds for revising our ideals, principles,\nand standards. (This is not to suggest that the import of the data\nthemselves should be taken at face value. Some regrets simply reflect\nthe resistance of old dysfunctional habits; some complaints are\nunreasonable; some disapprovals reflect hidebound and dogmatic\ndispositions. But these hypotheses, too, can be tested.) History and\nthe social sciences provide us with additional data on the customs and\nlaws by which people have dealt with the problems that have arisen in\ntheir circumstances, and general knowledge of human psychology and\nsocial interactions that enable us to learn from the experiences of\nothers and formulate educated guesses \u2014 new hypotheses \u2014\nfor how we might solve our problems.\n\nDewey stressed several themes in developing his account of reflective\nmorality for the present day: change, pluralism, conflict, and\nanti-authoritarianism. Living in an era of unprecedented social\nchange, Dewey situated reflective morality in a non-teleological\nDarwinian view of organisms\u2019 adaptation to environmental\ncontingencies (IDP). Nature does not supply a telos or rule for human\nbeings, but rather a constantly changing environment to which humans\nneed to adjust by using their intelligence. Modern science and\neducation lead people to doubt old traditions and arrive at different\nbeliefs by empowering them to think for themselves. Immigration brings\npeople of different faiths and cultures together, with a need to\ndevise shared moral norms to regulate their interactions.\nInterpersonal conflict along lines of class, religion, race, and other\nsocially salient divisions generates demands for new norms to resolve\ndisputes. All of these factors undermine appeals to traditional norms,\nwhich are not adapted to changed circumstances, presuppose a consensus\nthat does not exist, and suppress rather than address interpersonal\nconflict. Nor is resort to traditional authorities any solution.\nPeople don\u2019t agree on their authority. Moreover, authority\nitself corrupts people\u2019s moral views:\n\nIt is difficult for a person in a place of authoritative power to\navoid supposing that what he wants is right as long as he has power to\nenforce his demand. And even with the best will in the world, he is\nlikely to be isolated from the real needs of others, and the perils of\nignorance are added to those of selfishness. (E 226)\n\n\nMoral insights come from the demands of others, not from any\nindividual\u2019s isolated reflections. And insights come from all\nsocial quarters. Intelligent revision of norms therefore requires\npractices of moral inquiry that stress mutual responsiveness to\nothers\u2019 claims, and social inclusion of all members of society.\nSuch practices are constitutive features of democracy, understood as a\nform of everyday life (not simply as a type of state constitution) (CD\n224\u2013230). This is the point at which Dewey\u2019s political\nphilosophy emerges from his ethics. Democracy, in Dewey\u2019s view,\nis the means by which we practice intelligent moral inquiry together,\nseeking solutions to the problems we face together (PP).\n",
