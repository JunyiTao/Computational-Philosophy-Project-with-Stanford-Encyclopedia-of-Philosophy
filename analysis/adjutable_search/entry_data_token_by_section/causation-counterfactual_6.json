    "main_text": "The Structural Equations Framework\n5. The Structural Equations Framework\n\nA number of contemporary philosophers have explored an alternative\ncounterfactual approach to causation that employs the structural\nequations framework. (Early exponents include Hitchcock 2001, 2007;\nWoodward 2003; Woodward and Hitchcock 2003.) This framework, which has\nbeen used in the social sciences and biomedical sciences since the\n1930s and 1940s, received its state-of-the-art formulation in Judea\nPearl\u2019s landmark 2000 book. Hitchcock and Woodward acknowledge\ntheir debt to Pearl\u2019s work and to related work on causal Bayes\nnets by Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines (2001).\nHowever, while Pearl and Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines focus on issues\nto do with causal discovery and inference, Woodward and Hitchcock\nfocus on issues of the meaning of causal claims. For this reason,\ntheir formulations of the structural equations framework are better\nsuited to the purposes of this discussion. The exposition of this\nsection largely follows that of Hitchcock 2001.\n",
