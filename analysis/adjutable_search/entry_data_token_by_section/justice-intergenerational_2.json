Consider the following claim: \n\n\nFuture generations by definition do not exist now. They cannot now,\ntherefore, be the present bearer or subject of anything, including\nrights. (De George 1981: 161; see also Macklin 1981: 151\u2013152;\nBeckerman & Pasek 2001: 14\u201323; Herstein 2009:\n1180\u20131182) \n\n\nClaiming that we can violate the rights of future people now does not,\nhowever, imply that future people have rights now (though see\nPartridge 1990: 54\u201355, who suggests that future people have\nrights in the present). That implication would hold only if it were\nconceded that presently existing rights alone constrain present\naction. But we can safely assume, first, that future people will be\nbearers of rights in the future, second, that the rights they have\nwill be determined by the interests they have then, and third, that\nour present actions and policies can affect their interests. If we can\nviolate a person\u2019s rights by frustrating her interests severely,\nand if we can so severely frustrate such interests of future people,\nwe can violate their future rights (see Hoerster 1991: 98\u2013102).\nTheir future existence itself is thus insufficient to ground the claim\nthat we cannot now violate the rights of future persons.\n\nAccording to the second argument, for future people to have rights\nvis-\u00e0-vis us we would have to ascribe a right to existence to\nthem. However, we are not committed to the claim that if we are able\nnow to violate the rights of future generations, it is their rights to\nexistence that we violate. Since it is implausible that\nanyone has a right to existence as such, it is implausible\nthat future persons have rights to existence. Furthermore, when we\nprevent someone\u2019s existence, we do not thereby harm the\nhypothetical interests of this potential subject. Thus, claiming that\nactual future people have rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently living\npeople now cannot commit us to claiming that possible future people\nhave a right to existence.\n\nThe third argument points to the fact that our epistemic situation\ndoes not allow us to relate to future people as individuals. Can our\npresent actions nonetheless be constrained by rights of future\ngenerations that are based on interests other than existence as such,\ninterests such as subsistence, etc.? This is possible only if\nattributing rights to people does not require us to make reference to\nindividual persons (Herstein 2009: 1180\u20131182). However, third,\nlack of particular knowledge of future people as individuals does not\nstand in the way of attributing to them welfare rights, such as a\nright to subsistence.\n [1]\n The corresponding obligations do not depend on the\nparticular identity of future persons. Rather, such\nobligations are grounded in the fact that future persons are human\nbeings; that is, they share those properties of being human that\npermit and require us to relate morally to them as fellow humans who\nshould be able to pursue their own well-being.\n\nHaving reported on skeptical doubts concerning the possibility of\nfuture people having rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently living people\nwe now turn to an analysis of the relevance of the contingency of\nfuture people\u2014the subject that, under the title of the\n\u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d has been at the core of much of the\nphilosophical inquiry into the foundations of intergenerational\njustice\n (\u00a7\u00a73\u20134.4;\n see also entry\n nonidentity problem).\n We will introduce that core issue by addressing a specific criticism\nof the person-affecting view in the context of intergenerational\njustice\n (\u00a72.2):\n Some have argued that a person-affecting view cannot account for the\nwidely held belief that persons have the right not to be brought into\nexistence if the person-to-be would not reach a sufficiently good (or\ndecent) level of well-being.\n",
