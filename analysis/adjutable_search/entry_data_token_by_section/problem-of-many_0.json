    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn his (1980), Peter Unger introduced the \u201cProblem of the\nMany\u201d. A similar problem appeared simultaneously in P. T. Geach\n(1980), but Unger\u2019s presentation has been the most influential\nover recent years. The problem initially looks like a special kind of\npuzzle about\n vague predicates,\n but that may be misleading. Some of the standard solutions to\n Sorites paradoxes\n do not obviously help here, so perhaps the Problem reveals some\ndeeper truths involving the metaphysics of material constitution, or\nthe logic of statements involving identity.\n\nThe puzzle arises as soon as there is an object without clearly\ndemarcated borders. Unger suggested that clouds are paradigms of this\nphenomenon, and recent authors such as David Lewis (1993) and Neil\nMcKinnon (2002) have followed him here. Here is Lewis\u2019s\npresentation of the puzzle:\n\nThink of a cloud\u2014just one cloud, and around it a clear blue sky.\nSeen from the ground, the cloud may seem to have a sharp boundary. Not\nso. The cloud is a swarm of water droplets. At the outskirts of the\ncloud, the density of the droplets falls off. Eventually they are so\nfew and far between that we may hesitate to say that the outlying\ndroplets are still part of the cloud at all; perhaps we might better\nsay only that they are near the cloud. But the transition is gradual.\nMany surfaces are equally good candidates to be the boundary of the\ncloud. Therefore many aggregates of droplets, some more inclusive and\nsome less inclusive (and some inclusive in different ways than\nothers), are equally good candidates to be the cloud. Since they have\nequal claim, how can we say that the cloud is one of these aggregates\nrather than another? But if all of them count as clouds, then we have\nmany clouds rather than one. And if none of them count, each one being\nruled out because of the competition from the others, then we have no\ncloud. How is it, then, that we have just one cloud? And yet we do.\n(Lewis 1993: 164)\n\n\nThe paradox arises because in the story as told the following eight\nclaims each seem to be true, but they are mutually inconsistent.\n\nThere are several distinct sets of water droplets\nsk such that for each such set, it is not clear\nwhether the water droplets in sk form a\ncloud.\nThere is a cloud in the sky.\nThere is at most one cloud in the sky.\nFor each set sk, there is an object\nok that the water droplets in\nsk compose.\nIf the water droplets in si compose\noi, and the objects in sj\ncompose oj, and the sets si\nand sk are not identical, then the objects\noi and oj are not\nidentical.\nIf oi is a cloud in the sky, and\noj is a cloud in the sky, and\noi is not identical with oj,\nthen there are at least two clouds in the sky.\nIf any of these sets si is such that its\nmembers compose a cloud, then for any other set\nsj, if its members compose an object\noj, then oj is a cloud.\nAny cloud is composed of a set of water droplets.\n\n\nTo see the inconsistency, note that by 1 and 7 there is a cloud\ncomposed of water droplets. Say this cloud is composed of the water\ndroplets in si, and let sj be\nany other set whose members might, for all we can tell, form a cloud.\n(Premise 0 guarantees the existence of such a set.) By 3, the water\ndroplets in sj compose an object\noj. By 4, oj is not identical\nto our original cloud. By 6, oj is a cloud, and\nsince it is transparently in the sky, it is a cloud in the sky. By 5,\nthere are at least two clouds in the sky. But this is inconsistent\nwith 2. A solution to the paradox must provide a reason for rejecting\none of the premises, or a reason to reject the reasoning that led us\nto the contradiction, or the means to live with the contradiction.\nSince none of the motivations for believing in the existence of\n dialetheia\n apply here, let us ignore the last possibility. And since 0 follows\ndirectly from the way the story is told, let us ignore that option as\nwell. That leaves open eight possibilities.\n\n(The classification of the solutions here is slightly\ndifferent from that in Chapter One of Hud Hudson\u2019s \u201cA\nMaterialist Metaphysics of the Human Person.\u201d But it has a deep\ndebt to Hudson\u2019s presentation of the range of solutions, which\nshould be clear from the discussion that follows.)\n",
