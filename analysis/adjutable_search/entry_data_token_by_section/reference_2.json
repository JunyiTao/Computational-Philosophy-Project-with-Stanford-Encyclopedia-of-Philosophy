    "main_text": "Proper Names || Descriptivist Theories\n2.1 Descriptivist Theories\n\nAccording to descriptivist theories of proper names, a particular use\nof a proper name refers when the descriptive content somehow\nassociated with that use suffices to pick out a specific object or\nindividual. On one standard way of working out this sort of view, one\nassociated with both Gottlob Frege (1892) and Bertrand Russell (1911),\nsome particular descriptive content is associated with a given use of\na name because the speaker associates this content, in her\nmind, with the name in question. For the use of the name to refer,\nthis descriptive content must uniquely determine the name\u2019s\nreferent. So when a speaker uses the name \u2018N\u2019\nand, in so doing, successfully refers to a particular object or\nindividual x, this sort of descriptivist claims (i) that the\nspeaker must be thinking of N as the (unique) F and\n(ii) that x must in fact be the (unique) F. In other\nwords, this sort of \u2018classical\u2019 descriptivist posits that\nreferential success hinges on speakers attaching to each name in their\nrepertoire some descriptive content F which uniquely singles\nout a specific object in the world. Conversely, when speakers fail\nto associate a sufficiently precise description with a name, this sort\nof descriptivist predicts that reference fails.\n\nClassical descriptivists, like Frege and Russell, were perfectly\nwilling to acknowledge that the descriptive content in question might\nvary\u2014sometimes quite markedly\u2014from one speaker to the\nnext. Indeed, according to Russell, such contents may vary across time\nfor one and the same speaker. Thus, while I might associate the name\n\u2018Obama\u2019 with the descriptive content the previous U.S.\npresident, Michelle Obama might associate the same name with the\ndescriptive content my husband. If Trump were to assume\ndictatorial powers, my identifying content associated with Obama might\nwell change\u2014perhaps to something like the last legitimate\npresident of the United States. If Barack and Michelle were to\ndivorce, Michelle\u2019s identifying descriptive content would no doubt\nchange as well\u2014perhaps to my ex-husband. In all of\nthese cases, the individual referred to by means of the name is\ndetermined (or, as it is often put, is \u2018picked out\u2019 or\n\u2018fixed\u2019) by the particular descriptive content the speaker\nassociates with that name. Because the descriptive content in question\nis typically characterized by means of a definite description (an\nexpression of the form the F), such theories are often (even\nif somewhat\n misleadingly[2])\n known as \u2018descriptivist theories\u2019 of proper names.\n\nTo get the intuitive appeal of descriptivism more clearly in view,\nconsider a case where we know two individuals named \u2018David\nCameron\u2019\u2014one of whom is a mutual friend and has never\nheld any elected office, the other of whom is the former Prime\nMinister of the United Kingdom. Suppose now that I assertively\nutter:\n\nDavid Cameron made a grave error.\n\n\nIf for some reason you are confused about who I am talking about, the\nnatural thing for you to do is to ask me \u201cWhich David Cameron do\nyou mean?\u201d I might then respond \u201cThe former Prime Minister\nof the U.K.,\u201d and this seems to be dispositive of the facts\nhere. That is, supposing that this is the description I had in mind,\nthen it would seem that my utterance of (2) is genuinely\nabout David Cameron the former Prime Minister and not our\nmutual friend, the non-politician. Likewise, the truth or falsity of\n(2) would seem to hinge on how things are with the former Prime\nMinister and not on how things are with our mutual friend of the same\nname. \n\nSome other appealing aspects of descriptivism become evident when we\npair the thesis considered above, a thesis about what determines\nreference, with a natural companion thesis to the effect that the\ndescriptive contents associated with uses of names also provide their\ntoken meanings. In other words, proper names may well refer, but they\nonly do so via their meanings\u2014which are more like\ndefinite descriptions. By adopting this thesis, the descriptivist now\nhas ready explanations available for a range of philosophically\ninteresting cases. So, consider:\n\nHesperus is Phosphorus.\nSanta Claus lives at the North Pole.\nFred believes that Cicero, but not Tully, was Roman.\n\n\n(3) is true, but not knowable apriori. That said, if the\nmeanings of these two names is just whatever they refer to, we lack\nany obvious explanation for why (3) isn\u2019t knowable apriori.\nAfter all, it just turns out to be an instance of the law of\nself-identify\u2014something which very plausibly is\nknowable apriori. The meaning descriptivist, however, can say\nthat what (3) asserts is that two distinct descriptions are satisfied\nby the same object. Given what the relevant descriptions are likely to\nbe here, this won\u2019t be something that can plausibly be known\napriori. (4) presents a different sort of challenge: if the\nname \u2018Santa Claus\u2019 fails to refer, then how can an\nutterance of this sentence count as meaningful? What, in other words,\nis such an utterance about? Again, the meaning descriptivist\nhas an easy answer here. What (4) means is something like there is\nsome unique bearded, jolly elf who lives at the North Pole.\nFinally, one might worry that if \u2018Cicero\u2019 and\n\u2018Tully\u2019 just refer, and refer to the same thing, then it\nbecomes rather difficult to see how Fred could believe something about\nthe one but not about the other. But if Fred associates each name with\na different description, and if those descriptions are crucial to the\nmeaning of (5), then the problem simply dissolves.\n\nThe central challenge to the descriptivist theory is that there is\nreason to suspect that proper names are not semantically equivalent to\ndefinite descriptions. Saul Kripke (1972) argues, for example, that\nnames pick out the same object even when embedded under modal terms\nlike \u2018might\u2019, whereas definite descriptions typically\ndon\u2019t do this. Returning to our earlier example of \u2018David\nCameron\u2019 and supposing that the description I associate with\nCameron is the British Prime Minister who called for a referendum\non Brexit, it seems that I can still truly assert:\n\n David Cameron might not have called for a referendum on\nBrexit.\n\n\nIf descriptivism is right about both meaning and reference, however,\nthen (6) should be equivalent to:\n\n It might have been the case that: the British Prime Minister who\ncalled for a referendum on Brexit did not call for a referendum on\nBrexit.\n\n\nGranted, (7) is not really a claim of ordinary English. Still, holding\nfixed that we are talking about metaphysical rather than\nepistemic possibility here, it should be clear enough that (7)\nis false: if there is someone who satisfies the description \u2018the\nBritish Prime Minister who called for a referendum on Brexit\u2019 in\nwhatever possible situation we are considering, then that individual\ncalled for a Brexit referendum in that possible situation.\n\nNow, in more ordinary English, there is a way of hearing something\nalong the lines of (7) as true: assuming that we are talking about the\nPrime Minister who  actually called for a referendum, of\ncourse he might not have. But that is not how definite descriptions\nare typically assumed to function; rather, they are typically\nunderstood to be flexible, or  non-rigid across the space of\npossibility, picking out whatever happens to satisfy them in whatever\npossible situation we are considering. So, if the descriptivist is to\navail herself of this sort of defensive maneuver, as some have been\ntempted to, then she will have to motivate the claim that names are\nsemantically equivalent not to definite descriptions per se,\nbut rather to \u2018actualized\u2019 or \u2018rigidified\u2019\nversions\n thereof.[3]\n\nThis challenge can be avoided by a descriptivist who is willing to\ngive up on the claim that what a proper name means, on a given occasion,\nis equivalent to a definite description. In that case, an associated\ndescription will fix reference relative to the actual world, and then\nthat referent is what relevant to determining the truth of modal\nstatements. This response, however, entails giving up on the nice\nexplanations of (3)\u2013(5) that the more committal meaning\ndescriptivist was able to provide. What\u2019s more, even this more minimal\nversion of descriptivism will run into another problem raised by\nKripke, what is often called the \u2018semantic\u2019 problem.\n\nThis problem runs as follows: often, we don\u2019t associate enough\ninformation with a name to pick out any particular individual.\nNonetheless, we seem to be capable of using that name to refer to a\nspecific individual. Kripke offers as an example the name\n\u2018Feynman\u2019. Most people, Kripke claims, will at best know\nthat Feynman was a physicist; they will not know anything, aside from\nthe name, that would serve to differentiate Feynman from any other\nphysicist they have heard of. The problem is that an indefinite\ndescription like a physicist will not suffice to pick out any\nparticular individual in the world. Even  a physicist named\n\u2018Feynman\u2019 won\u2019t do, at least in a world where two\nphysicists bear this name. At best, this sort of description\nwill pick out an arbitrary member of a class of individuals, not a\nparticular one. And yet, as Kripke points out, it seems perfectly\ncoherent for someone who knows nothing about Feynman, who has only\noverheard someone using the name, to say to herself \u201cI wonder\nwho Feynman is,\u201d or to ask her friend \u201cWho is\nFeynman?\u201d In each of these cases, the natural thing to say is\nthat the speaker is using the name \u2018Feynman\u2019 to wonder or\nask about Feynman. How she can manage to do so, however, looks to be\nsomething that is going to be very difficult for the descriptivist to\nexplain\u2014assuming (i) that she  wants to maintain\nthe link between associated descriptions and the information available\nto an individual speaker, and (ii) that she is unwilling\nto rely on descriptions like whoever the person I overheard this\nname from was using it to talk about.\n\nBefore moving on to the Millian alternative, it is worth noting that\nsome descriptivists have indeed been tempted to defend the theory by \ngiving up on the link mentioned in (i). P.F. Strawson (1959), for instance,\nsuggests that speakers may rely on others to provide the relevant\ndescriptive content, the content that serves to hook a given use of a\nname onto an object or individual in the world. In fact, Strawson\nallows that groups can effectively use names to refer so long as there\nis a at least one expert among them for whom for whom the following holds:\nwhen we pool expert opinion, a plurality of the the descriptions\nthey associate with the relevant name are true of a single object. This\nwill effectively deal with Kripke\u2019s Feynman case, but at an intuitive\ncost. For now the descriptivist has not only forfeited her ability to\nexplain (3)\u2013(5), she has also risked making it the case that\nspeakers will have no special access to who they are talking about\nwhen using a name. If speakers regularly lack sufficient information\nto identify the referent of their use of a proper name, then it is\nhighly unclear why we would be justified in relying on them to answer\nquestions like \u201cWhich N were you talking about?\u201d\nSome may be tempted to pay this price. Others may be tempted to try to\nintegrate bits and pieces of descriptivism even into theories which\nare otherwise anti-descriptivist. In fact, this latter option has\nproven a popular one, and much of what follows can be viewed as a study\nin how this strategy has played out with respect to different sorts of\nreferential terms.\n",
