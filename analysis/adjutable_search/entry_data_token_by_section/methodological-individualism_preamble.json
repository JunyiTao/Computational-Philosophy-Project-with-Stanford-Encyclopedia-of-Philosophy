    "main_text": "\n\n\nThis doctrine was introduced as a methodological precept for the\nsocial sciences by Max Weber, most importantly in the first chapter of\nEconomy and Society (1922). It amounts to the claim\nthat social phenomena must be explained by showing how they result\nfrom individual actions, which in turn must be explained through\nreference to the intentional states that motivate the individual\nactors. It involves, in other words, a commitment to the primacy of\nwhat Talcott Parsons would later call \u201cthe action frame of\nreference\u201d (Parsons 1937: 43\u201351) in social-scientific\nexplanation. It is also sometimes described as the claim that\nexplanations of \u201cmacro\u201d social phenomena must be supplied\nwith \u201cmicro\u201d foundations, ones that specify an\naction-theoretic mechanism (Alexander, 1987).\n\n\nA contrast is often drawn, following J.W.N. Watkins (1952a), between\nmethodological individualism and methodological holism. This is\nusually tendentious, since there are very few social scientists who\ndescribe themselves as methodological holists. There are, however,\nforms of social-scientific explanation with more active adherents that\nmethodological individualism precludes or downgrades. These include,\nmost importantly, functionalism, many types of sociobiology,\n\u201cmemetics\u201d or evolutionary cultural explanation,\npsychoanalytic and \u201cdepth hermeneutic\u201d methods, and any\nform of explanatory generalization grounded in purely statistical\nanalysis.\n\n\nDefenders of methodological individualism generally claim that it is\nan innocent doctrine, devoid of any political or ideological\ncontent. Weber himself cautioned that \u201cit is a tremendous\nmisunderstanding to think that an \u2018individualistic\u2019\nmethod should involve what is in any conceivable sense an\nindividualistic system of values\u201d (Weber 1922:\n18). Nevertheless, the doctrine of methodological individualism became\nembroiled in a number of highly politicized debates during the\n20th century, largely because it was often invoked as a way\nof discrediting historical materialism.  There were two distinct\nrounds of controversy on this score. The first occurred primarily\nduring the 1950s, in response to the work of Friedrich von Hayek and\nKarl Popper. The second round occurred during the 1980s, in\nresponse to Jon Elster, this time as part of critical debates within\nthe movement known as \u201canalytical Marxism.\u201d During the\nlatter period, methodological individualism became widely associated\nwith what many called \u201crational choice imperialism.\u201d\n",
