    "main_text": "Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Causal Inference || Implications\n3.5 Implications\n\nWhether Pearl provides the correct causal explanation of\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox remains a topic of continued debate (Armistead\n2014 see also\n Section 4).\n What should not, however, be controversial is that recent causal\nmodeling techniques enable one to systematically distinguish between\ncausal and probabilistic claims in a much more general and precise way\nthan had previously been possible. While Cartwright required that all\ncauses of \\(E\\) be included in the background context, for the sake of\neliminating confounding it is only necessary to hold fixed\ncommon causes (and other variables needed to block back-door\npaths). Theorists of probabilistic causality were to some extent aware\nthat one did not need to hold fixed all causes of the effect in order\nto eliminate confounding, but they lacked a general account of which\nvariable sets are sufficient for identifying the effect.\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox was especially threatening, since there was no\nway to provide general conditions under which an apparent positive\ncausal relationship in a population would disappear entirely upon\npartitioning. Using Pearl\u2019s framework, it is trivial to show\nthat as long as one does not condition on mediators, if a\nprobabilistic expression identifies an average positive effect between\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in a population, intervening on \\(X\\) must raise\n\\(Y\\)\u2019s effect in at least some subpopulations\n(Weinberger 2015).\n\nTurning back to the debate about average effects in the probabilistic\nframework, this fact vindicates Dupr\u00e9\u2019s (1984) liberal\nattitude toward average effects against critics such as Eells and\nSober (1983: 54) who dismiss it as a \u201csorry excuse for a causal\nconcept\u201d (though see Hitchcock 2003: 13\u201315, and Hausman\n2010: 56, for further nuances). Of course, a positive average effect\nis compatible with the cause lowering the probability of the effect\nsignificantly in many subpopulations. This reflects the fact that the\npartitioning variable(s) could interact with the cause of interest.\nBut such possible interactions do not make the effect any less genuine\nas an average effect for the whole population.\n\nThis brings us to the issue of whether Simpson\u2019s Paradox\nthreatens the objectivity of causal relationships. Properly\nunderstood, it does not. It is certainly true that a cause can raise\nthe probability of its effect in one population and lower it in\nanother, or that it can have a positive effect in a whole population,\nbut not in some of its subpopulations. But it is not as if only some\nof these causal relationships are genuine and that philosophers must\ntherefore find a privileged background context within which the true\nrelationship is revealed. It is simply a fact about causation that\ndifferent populations can have different sets of interactive\nbackground factors, and thus the average effects will genuinely differ\nacross the populations.\n",
