The English jurist John\nAustin (1790\u20131859) formulated it thus: \n\n\nThe existence of law is one thing; its merit and demerit another.\nWhether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not\nconformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry. (1832\n[1995: 157]) \n\n\nThe positivist thesis does not say that law\u2019s merits are\nunintelligible, unimportant, or peripheral to the philosophy of law.\nIt says that they do not determine whether laws or legal systems\nexist. Whether a society has a legal system depends on the\npresence of certain structures of governance, not on the extent to\nwhich it satisfies ideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law.\nWhat laws are in force in that system depends on what social standards\nits officials recognize as authoritative; for example, legislative\nenactments, judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a\npolicy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient\nreason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it\nis unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason\nfor doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has\nbeen posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.). Austin\nthought the thesis \u201csimple and glaring\u201d. While it is\nprobably the dominant view among analytically inclined philosophers of\nlaw, it is also the subject of competing interpretations together with\npersistent criticisms and misunderstandings.\n", "toc": [{"#DeveInfl": "1.

Development and Influence\n\nLegal positivism has a long history and a broad influence. It has\nantecedents in ancient political philosophy and is discussed, and the\nterm itself introduced, in mediaeval legal and political thought (see\nFinnis 1996). The modern doctrine, however, owes little to these\nforbears. Its most important roots lie in the political philosophies\nof Hobbes and Hume, and its first full elaboration is due to Jeremy\nBentham (1748\u20131832) whose account Austin adopted, modified, and\npopularized. For much of the next century an amalgam of their views,\naccording to which law is the command of a sovereign backed by force,\ndominated English philosophical reflection about law. By the\nmid-twentieth century, however, this account had lost its influence\namong working legal philosophers. Its emphasis on legislative\ninstitutions was replaced by a focus on law-applying institutions such\nas courts, and its insistence of the role of coercive force gave way\nto theories emphasizing the systematic and normative character of law.\nThe most important architects of contemporary legal positivism are the\nAustrian jurist Hans Kelsen (1881\u20131973) and the two dominating\nfigures in the analytic philosophy of law, H.L.A. Hart (1907\u201392)\nand Joseph Raz, among whom there are clear lines of influence, but\nalso important contrasts. Legal positivism\u2019s importance,\nhowever, is not confined to the philosophy of law. It can be seen\nthroughout social theory, particularly in the works of Marx, Weber,\nand Durkheim, and also among many lawyers, including the American\n\u201clegal realists\u201d and most contemporary feminist scholars.\nAlthough they disagree on many other points, these writers all\nacknowledge that law is essentially a matter of social fact. Some of\nthem are, it is true, uncomfortable with the label \u201clegal\npositivism\u201d and therefore hope to escape it. Their discomfort is\nsometimes the product of confusion. Lawyers often use\n\u201cpositivist\u201d abusively, to condemn a formalistic doctrine\naccording to which law is always clear and, however pointless or\nwrong, is to be rigorously applied by officials and obeyed by\nsubjects. It is doubtful that anyone ever held this view, but it is in\nany case false and has nothing to do with legal positivism. Among the\nphilosophically literate another, more intelligible, misunderstanding\nmay interfere. Legal positivism is here sometimes associated with the\nhomonymic but independent doctrines of logical positivism (the meaning\nof a sentence is its mode of verification) or sociological positivism\n(social phenomena can be studied only through the methods of natural\nscience). While there are historical connections and commonalities of\ntemper among these ideas, they are essentially different. The view\nthat the existence and content of law depends ultimately on social\nfacts does not rest on a particular semantic thesis, and it is\ncompatible with a range of theories about how one investigates the\nsocial world, including non-naturalistic accounts. To say that the\nexistence of law depends on facts and not on its merits is a thesis\nabout the relation among laws, facts, and merits, and not\notherwise a thesis about the individual relata. Hence, many\ntraditional \u201cnatural law\u201d moral doctrines\u2014including\nthe belief in a universal, objective morality grounded in human\nnature\u2014do not contradict legal positivism. The only influential\npositivist moral theories are the views that moral norms are\nvalid only if they have a source in divine commands or in social\nconventions. Such theists and relativists apply to morality the\nconstraints that legal positivists think hold for law.\n2. The Existence and Sources of Law\n\nEvery human society has some form of social order, some way of marking\nand encouraging approved behavior, deterring disapproved behavior, and\nresolving disputes about that behavior. What then is distinctive of\nsocieties with legal systems and, within those societies, of their\nlaw? Before exploring some positivist answers, it bears emphasizing\nthat these are not the only questions worth asking about law. While an\nunderstanding of the nature of law requires an account of what makes\nlaw distinctive, it also requires an understanding of what it has\nin common with other forms of social control. Some Marxists\nare positivists about the nature of law while insisting that its\ndistinguishing characteristics matter less than its role in\nreplicating and facilitating other forms of domination. (Though other\nMarxists disagree: see Pashukanis 1924). They think that the specific\nnature of law casts little light on their primary concerns. But one\ncan hardly know that in advance; it depends on what the nature of law\nis.\n\nFor Bentham and Austin, law is a phenomenon of societies with a\nsovereign: a determinate person or group who have supreme and\nabsolute de facto power\u2014they are obeyed by all or most\nothers but do not themselves similarly obey anyone else. The laws in\nthat society are a subset of the sovereign\u2019s commands:\ngeneral orders that apply to classes of actions and people and that\nare backed up by threat of force or \u201csanction\u201d. This\nimperatival theory is positivist, for it identifies the existence of\nlaw with patterns of command and obedience that can be ascertained\nwithout considering whether the sovereign has a moral right to rule or\nwhether their commands are meritorious. It has two other distinctive\nfeatures. The theory is monistic: it represents all laws as\nhaving a single form, imposing obligations on their subjects, though\nnot on the sovereign itself. The imperativalist acknowledges that\nultimate legislative power may be self-limiting, or limited externally\nby what public opinion will tolerate, and also that legal systems\ncontain provisions that are not imperatives (for example, permissions,\ndefinitions, and so on). But they regard these as part of the\nnon-legal material that is necessary for every legal system. (Austin\nis a bit more liberal on this point). The theory is also\nreductivist, for it maintains that the normative language\nused in describing and stating the law\u2014talk of authority,\nrights, obligations, and so on\u2014can all be analyzed without\nremainder in factual terms, typically as concatenations of statements\nabout power and obedience.\n\nImperatival theories are now without influence in legal philosophy\n(but see Ladenson 1980 and Morison 1982). What survives of their\noutlook is the idea that legal theory must ultimately be rooted in\nsome account of the political system, an insight that came to be\nshared by all major positivists save Kelsen. Their particular\nconception of a society under a sovereign commander, however, is\nfriendless (except among Foucauldians, who strangely take this relic\nas the ideal-type of what they call \u201cjuridical\u201d power). It\nis clear that in complex societies there may be no one who has all the\nattributes of sovereignty, for ultimate authority may be divided among\norgans and may itself be limited by law. Moreover, sovereignty is a\nnormative concept. A legislator is one who has authority to\nmake laws, and not merely someone with great social power, and it is\ndoubtful that \u201chabits of obedience\u201d is a candidate\nreduction for explaining authority. To distinguish genuine obedience\nfrom coincidental compliance we need something like the idea of\nsubjects being oriented to, or guided by, the commands. Explicating\nthis will carry us far from the power-based notions with which\nclassical positivism hoped to work. The imperativalists\u2019 account\nof the character of individual laws is also subject to decisive\nobjections (Hart 1961 [2012: 26\u201378]; and Hacker 1973). Treating\nall laws as commands conceals important differences in their social\nfunctions, in the ways they operate in practical reasoning, and in the\nsort of justifications to which they are liable. For instance, laws\nconferring the power to marry command nothing; they do not obligate\npeople to marry, or even to marry according to the prescribed\nformalities. Nor is reductivism any more plausible here: we speak of\nlegal obligations when there is no probability of sanctions being\napplied and when there is no provision for sanctions (as in the duty\nof courts to apply the law). Moreover, we take the existence of legal\nobligations to be a reason for imposing sanctions, not a\nconsequence or constituent of it.\n\nHans Kelsen retains the imperativalists\u2019 monism but abandons\ntheir reductivism. On his view, law is characterized by a singular\nform and basic norm. The form of every law is that of a\nconditional order, directed at the courts, to apply sanctions if a\ncertain behavior (the \u201cdelict\u201d) is performed. On this\nview, law is an indirect system of guidance: it does not tell subjects\nwhat to do; it tells officials what to do to its subjects\nunder certain conditions. Thus, what we ordinarily regard as the legal\nduty not to steal is for Kelsen merely a logical correlate of the\nprimary norm which stipulates a sanction for stealing (1945 [1961:\n61]). The objections to imperatival monism apply also to this more\nsophisticated version: the reduction misses important facts, such as\nthe point of having a prohibition on theft; the law is not indifferent\nbetween, on the one hand, people not stealing and, on the other,\nstealing and suffering the sanctions. But in one respect the\nconditional sanction theory is in worse shape than is imperativalism,\nfor it has no way to fix on the delict as the duty-defining condition\nof the sanction\u2014that is but one of a large number of relevant\nantecedent conditions, including the legal capacity of the offender,\nthe jurisdiction of the judge, the constitutionality of the offense,\nand so forth. Which among all these is the content of a legal\nduty?\n\nKelsen\u2019s most important contribution lies in his attack on\nreductivism and his doctrine of the \u201cbasic norm\u201d. He\nmaintains that law is a normative domain and must understood as such.\nMight does not make right\u2014not even legal right\u2014so the\nphilosophy of law must explain the fact that law imposes obligations\non its subjects. Moreover, law is a normative system:\n\u201cLaw is not, as it is sometimes said, a rule. It is a set of\nrules having the kind of unity we understand by a system\u201d (1945\n[1961: 3]). For the imperativalists, the unity of a legal system\nconsists in the fact that all its laws are commanded by one sovereign.\nFor Kelsen, it consists in the fact that they are all links in one\nchain of authority. For example, a by-law is legally valid because it\nis created by a corporation lawfully exercising the powers conferred\non it by the legislature, which confers those powers in a manner\nprovided by the constitution, which was itself created in a way\nprovided by an earlier constitution. But what about the very first\nconstitution, historically speaking? Its authority, says Kelsen, is\n\u201cpresupposed\u201d. The condition for interpreting any legal\nnorm as binding is that the first constitution is validated by the\nfollowing \u201cbasic norm:\u201d \u201cthe original\nconstitution is to be obeyed\u201d. Now, the basic norm cannot\nbe a legal norm\u2014we cannot explain the bindingness of law by\nreference to more law without an infinite regress. Nor can it be a\nsocial fact, for Kelsen maintains that the reason for the validity of\na norm must always be another norm\u2014no ought from is. It follows,\nthen, that a legal system must consist of norms all the way down. It\nbottoms in a hypothetical, transcendental norm that is the condition\nof the intelligibility of any (and all) other norms as binding. To\n\u201cpresuppose\u201d this basic norm is not to endorse it as good\nor just\u2014presupposition is a cognitive stance only\u2014but it\nis, Kelsen thinks, the necessary precondition for a non-reductivist\naccount of law as a normative system.\n\nThere are many difficulties with this, not least of which is the fact\nthat if we are going to accept the basic norm as the solution it is\nnot clear what we thought was the problem in the first place. One\ncannot say both that presupposing the basic norm is what validates all\ninferior norms and also that an inferior norm is part of the legal\nsystem only if it is connected by a chain of validity to the basic\nnorm. We need a way into the circle. Moreover, it draws the boundaries\nof legal systems incorrectly. The Canadian Constitution of 1982 was\nlawfully created by an Act of the U.K. Parliament, and on that basis\nCanadian law and English law should be parts of a single legal system,\nrooted in one basic norm: \u201cThe (first) U.K. constitution is to\nbe obeyed\u201d. Yet English law is not binding in Canada, and a\npurported repeal of the Constitution Act by the U.K. would be without\nlegal effect there.\n\nIf law cannot ultimately be grounded in force, or in a presupposed\nnorm, on what does its authority rest? The most influential solution\nis perhaps H.L.A. Hart\u2019s. His solution resembles Kelsen\u2019s\nin its emphasis on the normative foundations of legal systems, but\nHart rejects Kelsen\u2019s transcendentalist, Kantian view of\nauthority in favor of an empirical, Weberian one. For Hart, the\nauthority of law is social. The ultimate criterion of validity in a\nlegal system is neither a legal norm nor a presupposed norm, but a\nsocial rule that exists only because it is actually\npracticed, that is, used to guide conduct. Law ultimately\nrests on custom: customs about who shall have the authority to decide\ndisputes, what they shall treat as binding reasons for decision, i.e.,\nas sources of law, and how laws may be changed. Of these three\n\u201csecondary rules\u201d, as Hart calls them, the\nsource-determining rule of recognition is most important, for\nit specifies the ultimate criteria of validity in the legal system. It\nexists only because it is practiced by officials, and it is not only\nthat the recognition rule best explains their practice, it is the rule\nto which they actually appeal in arguments about what standards they\nare bound to apply. Hart\u2019s account is therefore in one sense\nconventionalist (see Marmor 1998 and Coleman 2001): ultimate legal\nrules are social norms, although they are neither the product of\nexpress agreement nor conventions in the Schelling-Lewis sense (see\nGreen 1999). Thus for Hart too the legal system is rule-based all the\nway down, but at its root is a social norm that has the kind of\nnormative force that customs have. It is a regularity of behavior\nregarding which officials take \u201cthe internal point of\nview:\u201d they use it as a standard for guiding and evaluating\ntheir own and others\u2019 behavior, and this use is displayed in\ntheir conduct and speech, including the resort to various forms of\nsocial pressure to support the rule and the ready application of\nnormative terms such as \u201cduty\u201d and\n\u201cobligation\u201d when invoking it.\n\nLaw, then, has its ultimate basis in the behaviors and attitudes of\nits officials. In the eyes of some this still seems to imply a\nmystifying reduction: how can we generate the oughts of the legal\nworld from the is of official consensus? Concerns of this type part\nmotivate Scott Shapiro\u2019s understanding of law and his attempt to\nbreak with Hart\u2019s theory: laws, he suggests, should be conceived\nof as \u201cgeneralized plans, or planlike norms, issued by those who\nare authorized to plan for others\u201d (2011: 155). Understanding\nlaw on the model of social planning, Shapiro suggests, frees us from\nmisplaced concerns about its metaphysical basis. Just as you or I can\nadopt a plan for our day just by willing it, so a legal system\u2019s\nofficials can create or recognize plans for its subjects. To the\nextent there remains an issue, however, it is not clear that the\nnotion of planning itself offers any deeper explanation. To begin\nwith, planning, whether by an individual or a group, involves setting\nrules with the aim of achieving certain ends. So the ontology of plans\nfolds into and becomes part of the more general ontology of rules on\nwhich Hart was rightly focused. Second, it is unclear whether the\nmechanics of law are accurately captured under the label of planning\n(is the law against theft, for example, to be thought of as a plan\nthat people not deprive others of their property?\u2014a somewhat\nimplausible reading of the relevant injunction\u2014or is the\nplanning element exhausted by the decision to create the prohibition,\nin which case the law is not the plan). Nonetheless, Shapiro\u2019s\naccount helpfully reminds us that the theoretical complexity of law as\na social kind does not render implausible an understanding of its\nfoundation based in the everyday actions of its agents. In this he\njoins Hart.\n\nIt is an important feature of Hart\u2019s account that the rule of\nrecognition is an official custom, and not a standard\nnecessarily shared by the broader community. If the\nimperativalists\u2019 picture of the political system was pyramidal\npower, Hart\u2019s is more like Weber\u2019s rational bureaucracy.\nLaw is normally a technical enterprise, characterized by a division of\nlabor. Ordinary subjects\u2019 contribution to the existence of law\nmay therefore amount to no more than passive compliance, and in an\nextreme case perhaps less than this. Thus, Hart\u2019s necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of a legal system are that\n\n\n\nthose rules of behavior which are valid according to the\nsystem\u2019s ultimate criteria of validity must be generally obeyed,\nand\u2026its rules of recognition specifying the criteria of legal\nvalidity and its rules of change and adjudication must be effectively\naccepted as common public standards of official behavior by its\nofficials. (1961 [2012: 116]) \n\n\nAnd this division of labor is not a normatively neutral fact about\nlaw; it is politically charged, for it sets up the possibility of law\nbecoming remote from the life of a society, a hazard to which Hart is\nacutely alert (1961 [2012: 117]; cf. Waldron 1999 and Green 2008).\n\nAlthough Hart introduces the rule of recognition through a speculative\nanthropology of how it might emerge in response to deficiencies in a\ncustomary social order, he is not committed to the view that law is a\ncultural achievement. To the contrary, the idea that legal order is\nalways a good thing, and that societies without it are deficient, is a\nfamiliar element of many anti-positivist views, beginning\nwith Henry Maine\u2019s criticism of Austin on the ground that his\ntheory would not apply to certain Indian villages. The objection\nembraces the error it seeks to avoid. It imperialistically assumes\nthat it is always a bad thing to lack law, and then makes a dazzling\ninference from ought to is: if it is good to have law, then each\nsociety must have it, and the concept of law must be adjusted to show\nthat it does. If one thinks that law is a many splendored thing, one\nwill be tempted by a very wide understanding of law, for it would seem\nimproper to charge others with missing out. Positivism releases the\nharness. Law is a distinctive form of political order, not a moral\nachievement, and whether it is necessary or even useful depends\nentirely on its content and context. Societies without law may be\nperfectly adapted to their environments, missing nothing.\n\nA positivist account of the existence and content of law, along any of\nthe above lines, offers a theory of the validity of law in\none of the two main senses of that term (see Harris 1979:\n107\u2013111). Kelsen says that validity is the specific mode of\nexistence of a norm. In this sense a valid law is one that is\nsystemically valid in the jurisdiction\u2014it is part of\nthe legal system, and identified as such by virtue of its dependence\non the system\u2019s social sources. The idea is distinct from that\nof validity as moral propriety, i.e., a sound justification for\nrespecting the norm. For the legal positivist, this depends on the\nnorm\u2019s merits. One indication that these senses differ is that\none may know that a society has a legal system, and know what its laws\nare, without having any idea whether they are morally justified. For\nexample, one may know that the law of ancient Athens included the\npunishment of ostracism without knowing whether it was justified,\nbecause one does not know enough about its effects, about the social\ncontext, and so forth.\n\nNo legal positivist argues that the systemic validity of law\nestablishes its moral validity, i.e., that it should be\nobeyed by subjects or applied by judges. Even Hobbes, to whom this\nview is sometimes ascribed, required that law actually be able to keep\nthe peace, failing which we owe it nothing. Bentham and Austin, as\nutilitarians, hold that such questions always turn on the\nconsequences, and both acknowledge that disobedience is therefore\nsometimes fully justified. Kelsen insists that \u201cThe science of\nlaw does not prescribe that one ought to obey the commands of the\ncreator of the constitution\u201d (1960 [1967: 204]). Hart believes\nthat law may generate a prima facie duty to obey, grounded in\nbut also limited by fairness\u2014so there is no obligation to unfair\nor pointless laws (Hart 1955: 185\u2013186). Raz goes further still,\narguing that there isn\u2019t even a prima facie duty to\nobey the law, not even in a just state (Raz 1979 [2009:\n233\u2013249]). The peculiar accusation that positivists believe the\nlaw is always to be obeyed is without foundation. Indeed, Hart\u2019s\nown view is that an overweening deference to law consorts more easily\nwith theories that imbue it with moral ideals, permitting \n\n\nan enormous overvaluation of the importance of the bare fact that a\nrule may be said to be a valid rule of law, as if this, once declared,\nwas conclusive of the final moral question: \u201cOught this law to\nbe obeyed?\u201d (Hart 1958: 75)\n\n3. Moral Principles and the Boundaries of Law\n\nThe most influential criticisms of legal positivism all flow, in one\nway or another, from the suspicion that it fails to give morality its\ndue. A theory that insists on the facticity of law seems to contribute\nlittle to our understanding that law has important functions in making\nhuman life go well, that the rule of law is a prized ideal, and that\nthe language and practice of law is highly moralized. Accordingly,\npositivism\u2019s critics maintain that the most important features\nof law are not to be found in its source-based character, but in\nlaw\u2019s capacity to advance the common good, to secure human\nrights, or to govern with integrity.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that moral and political considerations bear on\nlegal philosophy. As Finnis says, the reasons we have for\nestablishing, maintaining or reforming law include moral reasons, and\nthese reasons therefore shape our legal concepts (1980 [2011:\n266\u2013273] and 1996: 204). But which concepts? If one\naccepts, as Finnis does, that the existence and content of law can be\nidentified without recourse to moral argument, and that \u201chuman\nlaw is artefact and artifice; and not a conclusion from moral\npremises\u201d (1996: 205), it becomes hard to see how the natural\nlaw theory he develops rivals rather than accommodates the truth of\nlegal positivism (see Gardner 2001, 225\u2013227). This\nvitiates also Lon Fuller\u2019s criticisms of Hart (Fuller 1958 and\n1964). Fuller has two main points. First, he thinks that it\nisn\u2019t enough for a legal system to rest on customary social\nrules, since law could not guide behavior without also being at least\nminimally clear, consistent, public, prospective and so on\u2014that\nis, without exhibiting to some degree those virtues collectively\ncalled \u201cthe rule of law\u201d. It suffices to note that this is\nconsistent with law being source-based. Even if moral properties were\nidentical with, or supervened upon, these rule-of-law properties, they\ndo so in virtue of their rule-like character. Whatever virtues inhere\nin or follow from clear, consistent, prospective, and open practices\ncan be found not only in law but in all other social practices with\nthose features, including custom and positive morality. And such\nvirtues, if they exist, are minor: there is little, if anything, to be\nsaid in favor of a clear, consistent, prospective, public and\nimpartially administered system of racial segregation, for\nexample. Fuller\u2019s second worry is that if law is a matter of\nfact, then we are without an explanation of the duty to obey. He asks\nhow \u201can amoral datum called law could have the peculiar quality\nof creating an obligation to obey it\u201d (Fuller 1958: 656). One\npossibility he neglects is that it doesn\u2019t. But even if Fuller\nis right in his unargued assumption, the \u201cpeculiar\nquality\u201d whose existence he doubts is a familiar feature of many\npractices. Compare promises: whether a society has a practice of\npromising, and what someone has promised to do, are matters of social\nfact. Yet promising creates moral obligations of performance or\ncompensation. An \u201camoral datum\u201d may indeed figure,\ntogether with other premises, in a sound argument to moral\nconclusions.\n\nWhile Finnis and Fuller\u2019s views are thus compatible with the\npositivist thesis, the same cannot be said of Ronald Dworkin\u2019s\nimportant works (Dworkin 1978, 1986 and 2011). Positivism\u2019s most\ninfluential critic rejects the theory on every conceivable level. He\ndenies that there can be any general theory of the existence\nand content of law; he denies that local theories of particular legal\nsystems can identify law without recourse to its merits, and he\nrejects the whole institutional focus of positivism. A theory of law\nis for Dworkin a theory of how cases ought to be decided and it\nbegins, not with an account of political organization, but with an\nabstract ideal regulating the conditions under which governments may\nuse coercive force over their subjects. Coercion must not be deployed,\nhe claims, \n\n\nexcept as licensed or required by individual rights and\nresponsibilities flowing from past political decisions about when\ncollective force is justified. (Dworkin 1986: 93) \n\n\nA society has a legal system only when, and to the extent that, it\nhonors this ideal, and its law is the set of all considerations that\nthe courts of such a society would be morally justified in applying,\nwhether or not those considerations are determined by any source. To\nidentify the law of a given society we must always engage in moral and\npolitical argument, for the law is whatever requirements are\nconsistent with an interpretation of its legal practices that shows\nthem to be best justified in light of this animating ideal. In\naddition to these philosophical considerations, Dworkin invokes two\nfeatures of the phenomenology of judging, as he sees it. He finds deep\ncontroversy among lawyers and judges about how important\ncases should be decided, and he finds diversity in the\nconsiderations that they hold relevant to deciding them. The\ncontroversy suggests to him that law cannot rest on an official\nconsensus, and the diversity suggests that there is no single social\nrule that validates all relevant reasons, moral and non-moral, for\njudicial decisions.\n\nDworkin\u2019s rich and complex arguments attracted various lines of\nreply from positivists. One response denies the relevance of the\nphenomenological claims. Controversy is a matter of degree, and a\nconsensus-defeating amount of it is not proved by the existence of\nadversarial argument in the high courts, or indeed in any courts. As\nimportant is the broad range of settled law that gives rise to few\ndoubts and which guides social life outside the courtroom\n(see Leiter 2009). As for the diversity argument, so far from being a\nrefutation of positivism, this is an entailment of it. Positivism\nidentifies law, not with all valid reasons for decision, but only with\nthe source-based subset of them. It is no part of the positivist claim\nthat the rule of recognition tells us how to decide cases, or even\nidentifies all relevant reasons for a decision. Positivists accept\nthat moral, political or economic considerations are properly\noperative in legal decisions, just as linguistic or logical ones are.\nModus ponens holds in court as much as outside, but not\nbecause it was enacted by the legislature or decided by the judges,\nand the fact that there is no social rule that validates both\nmodus ponens and also the Municipalities Act is true but\nirrelevant. The authority of principles of logic (or morality) is not\nsomething to be explained by legal philosophy; the authority of acts\nof Parliament must be; and accounting for the difference is a central\ntask of the philosophy of law.\n\nOther positivists respond differently to Dworkin\u2019s\nphenomenological points, accepting their relevance but modifying the\ntheory to accommodate them. So-called \u201cinclusive\npositivists\u201d (e.g., Soper, Lyons, Coleman, Waluchow (to whom the\nterm is due), Kramer and Himma) argue that the merit-based\nconsiderations may indeed be part of the law, if they are explicitly\nor implicitly made so by source-based considerations. For example,\nCanada\u2019s constitution explicitly authorizes for breach of\nCharter rights, \u201csuch remedy as the court considers appropriate\nand just in the circumstances\u201d. In determining which remedies\nmight be legally valid, judges are thus expressly told to take into\naccount their morality. And judges may develop a settled practice of\ndoing this whether or not it is required by any enactment; it may\nbecome customary practice in certain types of cases. Reference to\nmoral principles may be implicit in the web of judge-made law, for\ninstance in the common law principle that no one should profit from\nhis own wrongdoing. Such moral considerations, inclusivists claim, are\npart of the law because the sources make them so, and thus\nDworkin is right that the existence and content of law might turn on\nits merits, and wrong only in his explanation of this fact. Legal\nvalidity depends on morality, not because of the interpretative\nconsequences of some ideal about how the government may use force, but\nbecause that is one of the things that may be customarily recognized\nas an ultimate determinant of legal validity. It is the sources that\nmake the merits relevant.\n\nTo understand and assess this response some clarifications are needed.\nFirst, it is not plausible to hold that the merits are relevant to a\njudicial decision only when the sources make them so. It\nwould be odd to think that justice is a reason for decision only\nbecause some source directs an official to decide justly. It\nis of the nature of justice that it properly bears on certain\ncontroversies. In legal decisions, especially important ones, moral\nand political considerations are present of their own authority; they\ndo not need sources to propel them into action. On the contrary, we\nexpect to see a source\u2014a statute, a decision, or a\nconvention\u2014when judges are constrained not to appeal\ndirectly to the merits (see Raz 2004a). Second, the fact that there is\nmoral language in judicial decisions does not establish the presence\nof moral tests for law, for sources come in various guises. What\nsounds like moral reasoning in the courts is sometimes really\nsource-based reasoning. For example, when the Supreme Court of Canada\nsays that a publication is criminally \u201cobscene\u201d only if it\nis harmful, it is not applying J.S. Mill\u2019s harm principle, for\nwhat that court means by \u201charmful\u201d is that which is\nregarded by the community as degrading or intolerable. That\nis a source-based test, not a moral one. This is just one of many\nappeals to positive morality, i.e., to the moral customs actually\npracticed by a given society, and no positivist denies that positive\nmorality may be a source of law. Moreover, it is important to remember\nthat law is dynamic and that even a decision that does apply morality\nitself becomes a source of law, in the first instance for the\nparties and possibly for others as well. Over time, by the doctrine of\nprecedent where it exists or through the gradual emergence of an\ninterpretative convention where it does not, this gives a factual edge\nto normative terms. Thus, if a court decides that money damages are in\nsome instances not a \u201cjust remedy\u201d then this fact\nwill join with others in fixing what \u201cjustice\u201d means for\nthese purposes. This process may ultimately detach legal concepts from\ntheir moral analogs (thus, legal \u201cmurder\u201d may require no\nintention to kill, legal \u201cfault\u201d no moral blameworthiness,\nan \u201cequitable\u201d remedy may be manifestly unfair, etc.).\nBearing in mind these complications, however, there undeniably remains\na great deal of moral reasoning in adjudication. Courts are often\ncalled on to decide what would reasonable, fair, just, cruel, etc. by\nexplicit or implicit requirement of statute or common law, or because\nthis is the only proper or intelligible way to decide. When the law\nitself licenses such reasoning should we understand it, with the\ninclusive positivist, to incorporate moral standards, or, as per the\nviews of their rival, the exclusive positivist, only to make reference\nto moral principles?\n\nExclusive positivists offer two main arguments for stopping at social\nsources. The first is due to Raz (1994: 201\u201337) and has to do\nwith law\u2019s role in practical reasoning (for criticism see Perry\n1989, Waluchow 1994, Coleman 2001, Dworkin 2002, Kramer 2004 and\nHimma 2019). Although law does not necessarily have legitimate authority,\nRaz suggests it lays claim to it, and can intelligibly do so only if\nit is the kind of thing that could have legitimate authority.\nIt may fail, therefore, in certain ways only, for example, by being\nunjust, pointless, or ineffective. But law cannot fail to be a\ncandidate authority, for it is constituted in that role by\nour political practices. According to Raz, practical authorities\nmediate between subjects and the ultimate reasons for which they\nshould act. Authorities\u2019 directives should be based on such\nreasons, and they are justified only when compliance with the\ndirectives makes it more likely that people will comply with the\nunderlying reasons that apply to them. But they can do that,\nhe suggests, only if is possible to know what the directives require\nindependent of appeal to those underlying reasons. If law were to\nincorporate the moral standards to which it refers it would no longer\nbe able to play this mediating role; identifying the law would require\nidentifying the reasons underlying it. Because the nature of law is\npartly determined by its role in giving practical guidance, Raz\nconcludes, there is theoretical reason for stopping at source-based\nconsiderations.\n\nThe second argument challenges an underlying idea of inclusive\npositivism, what we might call the Midas Principle. \u201cJust as\neverything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which\nlaw refers becomes law \u2026\u201d (Kelsen 1945 [1961: 161]).\nKelsen thought that it followed from this principle that \n\n\nIt is\u2026possible for the legal order, by obliging the\nlaw-creating organs to respect or apply certain moral norms or\npolitical principles or opinions of experts to transform these norms,\nprinciples, or opinions into legal norms, and thus into sources of\nlaw. (Kelsen 1945 [1961: 132]) \n\n\n(Though he regarded this transformation as effected by a sort of tacit\nlegislation.) If sound, the Midas Principle holds in general and not\nonly with respect to morality, as Kelsen makes clear. Suppose then\nthat the Income Tax Act penalizes overdue accounts at 8% per annum. In\na relevant case, an official can determine the content of a legal\nobligation only by calculating compound interest. Does this make\nmathematics part of the law? A contrary indication is that it is not\nsubject to the rules of change in a legal system\u2014neither courts\nnor legislators can repeal or amend the law of commutativity. The same\nholds of other social norms, including the norms of foreign legal\nsystems. A conflict-of-laws rule may direct a Canadian judge to apply\nMexican law in a Canadian case. The conflicts rule is\nobviously part of the Canadian legal system. But the rule of Mexican\nlaw is not, for although Canadian officials can decide whether or not\nto apply it, they can neither change it nor repeal it, and the best\nexplanation for its existence and content makes no reference to\nCanadian society or its political system. In like manner, moral\nstandards, logic, mathematics, principles of statistical inference, or\nEnglish grammar, though all properly applied in cases, are not\nthemselves the law, for legal organs have applicative but not creative\npower over them. The inclusivist thesis is actually groping towards an\nimportant, but different, truth. Law is an open normative\nsystem (Raz 1975 [1990: 152\u2013154]): it adopts and enforces many\nother standards, including moral norms and the rules of social groups.\nThere is no warrant for adopting the Midas Principle to explain how or\nwhy it does this.\n\nAs noted above, Dworkin\u2019s arguments against positivism depend\nupon claims about the phenomenology of adjudication and about the\nconstraints imposed on jurisprudence by legal disagreement. Mark\nGreenberg\u2019s recent work takes as its starting point many of\nDworkin\u2019s claims, but his conclusions are in several ways more\nradical (see Greenberg 2004 and 2014). Greenberg\u2019s central\nargument against positivism is methodological: no one, he suggests,\nwould deny that the content of the law depends at least in part upon\nsocial facts. However, the question of which facts\u2014the\nsemantic content or intended effect of legislation, for\nexample\u2014cannot be answered by reference to further of the same:\n\u201claw practices\u2026cannot determine their own\nrelevance\u201d (2004: 185). Appeal must therefore be made to other\nkinds of considerations\u2014for Greenberg, considerations about the\nmoral import of our social practices. It is positivism\u2019s error\nto suggest that law could be practice-based all the way down. That the\ncontent of law depends upon social sources, however, is a truth borne\nout by law in general, as opposed to being established within local\nlegal practices. There is a categorical difference between the\nvalidity of the sources thesis\u2014a truth about law as a kind of\nsocial practice\u2014and the claim that in the UK, for example,\nstatute renders it is illegal to drive above 70 miles an hour on the\nmotorway. In this way the former explains the latter without\ncircularity, and without the need for appeal to morality.\n4. Law and Its Merits\n\nIt may clarify the philosophical stakes in legal positivism by\ncomparing it to a number of other theses with which it is sometimes\nwrongly identified, and not only by its opponents (see also Hart 1958,\nF\u00fc\u00dfer 1996, and Schauer 1996).\n4.1 The Fallibility Thesis\n\nLaw does not necessarily satisfy the conditions by which it is\nappropriately assessed (Lyons 1984: 63; Hart 1961 [2012:\n185\u2013186)]. Law should be just, but it may not be; it should\npromote the common good, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t; it should\nprotect moral rights, but it may fail miserably. This we may call the\nmoral fallibility thesis. The thesis is correct, but it is not the\nexclusive property of positivism. Aquinas accepts it, Fuller accepts\nit, Finnis accepts it, and Dworkin accepts it. Only a crude\nmisunderstanding of ideas like Aquinas\u2019s claim that \u201can\nunjust law seems to be no law at all\u201d might suggest the\ncontrary. Law may have an essentially moral character and yet be\nmorally deficient. Even if every law always does one kind of justice\n(formal justice; justice according to law), this does not entail that\nit does every kind of justice. Even if every law has a prima\nfacie claim to be applied or obeyed, it does not follow that it\nhas such a claim all things considered. The gap between these partial\nand conclusive judgments is all a natural law theory needs to\naccommodate the fallibility thesis. It is sometimes said that\npositivism gives a more secure grasp on the fallibility of\nlaw, for once we see that it is a social construction we will be less\nlikely to accord it inappropriate deference and better prepared to\nengage in a clear-headed moral appraisal of the law. This claim\nappealed to several positivists, including Bentham and Hart. But while\nthis might follow from the truth of positivism, it cannot provide an\nindependent argument for it. If law has an essentially moral character\nthen it is obfuscating, not clarifying, to describe it as a\nsource-based structure of governance.\n4.2 The Separability Thesis\n\nAt one point, Hart identifies legal positivism with \n\n\nthe simple contention that it is no sense a necessary truth that laws\nreproduce or satisfy certain demands of morality, though in fact they\nhave often done so. (1961 [2012: 185\u2013186]) \n\n\nMany other philosophers, encouraged also by the title of Hart\u2019s\nfamous essay, \u201cPositivism and the Separation of Law and\nMorals\u201d, (1958) treat the theory as the denial that there is a\nnecessary connection between law and morality\u2014they must be in\nsome sense \u201cseparable\u201d even if not in fact separate\n(Coleman 1982). The separability thesis is generally construed so as\nto tolerate any contingent connection between morality and\nlaw, provided only that it is conceivable that the connection\nmight fail. Thus, the separability thesis is consistent with all of\nthe following: (i) moral principles may be part of the law; (ii) law\nis usually, or even always in fact, valuable; (iii) the best\nexplanation for the content of a society\u2019s laws includes\nreference to the moral ideals current in that society; and (iv) a\nlegal system cannot survive unless it is seen to be, and thus in some\nmeasure actually is, just. All four claims are counted by the\nseparability thesis as contingent connections only; they do not hold\nof all possible legal systems\u2014they probably don\u2019t\neven hold of all historical legal systems. As merely contingent\ntruths, it is said that they do not affect the concept of law itself.\nIf we think of the positivist thesis this way, we might interpret the\ndifference between exclusive and inclusive positivism in terms of the\nscope of the modal operator:\n\n(EP) It is necessarily\nthe case that there is no connection between law and\nmorality.\n(IP) It is not\nnecessarily the case that there is a connection between law and\nmorality.\n\n\nIn reality, however, legal positivism is not to be identified with\neither thesis: both are false. There are many necessary\n\u201cconnections\u201d, trivial and non-trivial, between law and\nmorality. As John Gardner notes, legal positivism takes a position on\nonly one of them; it rejects any dependence of the existence\nof law on its merits (Gardner 2001). And with respect to this\ndependency relation, legal positivists are concerned with much more\nthan the relationship between law and morality, for in the\nonly sense in which they insist on a separation of law and morals they\nmust insist also\u2014and for the same reasons\u2014on a separation\nof law and economics.\n\nTo exclude this dependency relation, however, is to leave intact many\nother interesting possibilities. For instance, it is possible that\nmoral value derives from the existence of law (Raz 1975\n[1990: 165\u2013170]). If Hobbes is right, any order is better than\nchaos and in some circumstances order may be achievable only through\npositive law. Or perhaps in a Hegelian way every existing legal system\nexpresses deliberate governance in a world otherwise dominated by\nchance; law is the spirit of the community come to self-consciousness.\nNotice that these claims are consistent with the fallibility thesis,\nfor they do not deny that these supposedly good things might also\nbring evils, such as too much order or the will to power. Perhaps such\nderivative connections between law and morality are thought innocuous\non the ground that they show more about human nature than they do\nabout the nature of law. The same cannot be said of the following\nnecessary connections between law and morality, each of which goes to\nthe heart of our concept of law (on which see further Green 2008):\n\n(1) Necessarily, law\ndeals with moral matters.\n\n\nKelsen writes, \n\n\nJust as natural and positive law govern the same subject-matter, and\nrelate, therefore, to the same norm-object, namely the mutual\nrelationships of men\u2014so both also have in common the universal\nform of this governance, namely obligation. (Kelsen 1928\n[1973: 34]) \n\n\nThis is a matter of the content of all legal systems. Where there is\nlaw there is also morality, and they regulate the same matters by\nanalogous techniques. Of course to say that law deals with\nmorality\u2019s subject matter is not to say that it does so well,\nand to say that all legal systems create obligations is not to endorse\nthe duties so created. This notion is distinct from Hart\u2019s\n\u201cminimum content\u201d thesis according to which there are\nbasic rules governing violence, property, fidelity, and kinship that\nany legal system must encompass if it aims at the survival of social\ncreatures like ourselves (Hart 1961 [2012: 193\u2013200]). Hart\nregards this as a matter of \u201cnatural necessity\u201d and in\nthat measure is willing to qualify his endorsement of the separability\nthesis. But even a society that prefers national glory or the worship\nof gods to survival will charge its legal system with the same tasks\nits morality pursues. Unlike the rules of a health club, law has broad\nscope and reaches to the most important things in any society,\nwhatever they may be. Indeed, our most urgent political worries about\nlaw and its claims flow from just this capacity to regulate our most\nvital interests, and law\u2019s wide reach must figure in any\nargument about its legitimacy. (A distinct argument, developed most\nfully by Raz (1994) and Gardner (2012a), is that law not only occupies\nitself with moral matters but makes moral claims\nover us. For criticism see Kramer 1999: 83\u20139; Duarte\nd\u2019Almeida and Edwards 2014.)\n\n(2) Necessarily, law is\njustice-apt.\n\n\nIn view of the normative function of law in creating and enforcing\nobligations and rights, it always makes sense to ask whether\nlaw is just, and where it is found deficient to demand reform. Legal\nsystems are therefore the kind of thing that is apt for\nappraisal as just or unjust. This is a significant feature of law. Not\nall human practices are justice-apt. It makes no sense to ask whether\na certain fugue is just or to demand that it become so. The musical\nstandards of fugal excellence are pre-eminently internal\u2014a good\nfugue is a good example of its genre; it should be melodic,\ninteresting, inventive etc.\u2014and the further we get from these\ninternal standards of excellence the more diverse evaluative judgments\nabout it become. While some formalists flirt with similar ideas about\nlaw, this seems inconsistent with law\u2019s place amongst human\npractices. Even if law has internal standards of merit\u2014virtues\nuniquely its own that inhere in its law-like character\u2014these\ncannot preclude or displace its assessment on independent criteria of\njustice. A fugue may be at its best when it has all the virtues of\nfugacity; but law is not best when it excels in legality; law\nmust also be just. A society may therefore suffer not only from too\nlittle of the rule of law, but also from too much of it. This does not\npresuppose that justice is the only, or even the first, virtue of a\nlegal system. It means that our concern for its justice as one of its\nvirtues cannot be side lined by any claim of the sort that law\u2019s\npurpose is to be law, to its most excellent degree. Law stands\ncontinuously exposed to demands for justification, and that too shapes\nits nature and role in our lives and culture.\n\n(3) Necessarily, law is\nmorally risky.\n\n\nIt is a curious fact that almost all theories that insist on the\nessentially moral character of law take law\u2019s character to be\nessentially good. The gravamen of Fuller\u2019s philosophy is that\nlaw is essentially a moral enterprise, made possible only by a robust\nadherence to its own inner morality. The thought that the law might\nhave an inner immorality never occurred to him. But, as Hart\nrecognized, where there is \u201ca union of primary and secondary\nrules\u201d\u2014that is to say, wherever there is law\u2014moral\nrisks emerge as a matter of necessity. There are not only newly\nefficient forms of oppression, unavailable in communities with more\ndiffuse forms of social organization, there are also new vices: the\npossible alienation of community and value, the loss of transparency,\nthe rise of a new hierarchy, and the possibility that some who should\nresist injustice may be bought off by the goods that legal order\nbrings. Although law has its virtues, it also necessarily risks\ncertain vices, and this marks a connection between law and morality of\na reverse kind.\n\nThese three theses establish connections between law and morality that\nare both necessary and highly significant. Each of them is consistent\nwith the positivist thesis that the existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts, not on the law\u2019s merits. Each of them\ncontributes to an understanding of the nature of law. The once-popular\nidea that legal positivism insists on the separability of law and\nmorality is therefore significantly mistaken.\n4.3 The Neutrality Thesis\n\nThe preceding theses together establish that law is not\nvalue-neutral. Although some lawyers regard this idea as a revelation\n(and others as provocation) it is in fact banal. The thought that law\ncould be value neutral does not even rise to falsity\u2014it is\nincoherent. Law is a normative system, promoting certain values and\nrepressing others. Law is not neutral between victim and murderer or\nbetween owner and thief. When people complain of the law\u2019s lack\nof neutrality, they are in fact voicing very different aspirations,\nsuch as the demand that it be fair, just, impartial, and so forth. A\ncondition of law\u2019s achieving any of these ideals is that it is\nnot neutral in either its aims or its effects.\n\nPositivism is however sometimes more credibly associated with the idea\nthat legal philosophy is or should be value-neutral. Kelsen,\nfor example, says, \u201cthe function of the science of law is not\nthe evaluation of its subject, but its value-free description\u201d\n(1960 [1967: 68]) and Hart at one point described his work as\n\u201cdescriptive sociology\u201d (1961 [2012: v]). But a\ndescription of what? \u201cLaw\u201d is an anthropocentric subject,\ndependent not merely on our sensory embodiment but also, as its\nnecessary connections to morality show, on our moral sense and\ncapacities. Legal kinds such as courts, decisions, and rules will not\nappear in a purely physical description of the universe and may not\neven appear in every social description. (This may limit the prospects\nfor a \u201cnaturalized\u201d jurisprudence; though for a defense of\nthe contrary view, see Leiter 1997). Legal positivism, to be sure, is\nnot an \u201cevaluation of its subject\u201d, i.e., an evaluation of\nthe law. And to say that the existence of law depends on\nsocial facts does not commit one to thinking that it is a good thing\nthat this is so (nor does it preclude it: see MacCormick 1985 and\nCampbell 1996). But it does not follow that legal philosophy therefore\noffers a \u201cvalue-free description\u201d of its subject. There is\na sense, of course, in which every description is value-laden. It\nselects and systematizes only a subset of the infinite number of facts\nabout its subject. To describe law as resting on customary social\nrules is to omit many other truths about it including, for example,\ntruths about its connection to the demand for paper or silk. What\nforms the warrant for our prioritizing the former over the latter?\nFinnis (1980 [2011: 3\u201319]) thinks that the only possibility here\nhas to do with the moral reasons we might have for wanting law (that\nwe answer \u201cwhat?\u201d by answering \u201cwhy?\u201d) and\nthat the failure of methodological positivism, the failure to achieve\na value-free description of the subject, results in the failure of\nlegal positivism. But the question of social significance is not\nexhausted by our moral register, and especially not only by its\npositive valence (on which see Dickson 2001). Others point to the\nnotion of conceptual or metaphysical truth as setting the bounds of\nthe question that positivism seeks to answer (for discussion see Raz\n2004b). But however these difficult issues are to be resolved, we\nshould not expect legal positivism itself to contribute much. A thesis\nabout the nature of law is not at the same time a thesis about how to\nunderstand the nature of law.\n\nIt may seem, however, that legal positivism at least requires a stand\non the so-called \u201cfact-value\u201d problem. There is no doubt\nthat certain positivists, especially Kelsen, believe this to be so. In\nreality, positivism may cohabit with a range of views here\u2014value\nstatements may be entailed by factual statements; values may supervene\non facts; values may be kinds of fact. Legal positivism requires only\nthat it be in virtue of its facticity rather than its meritoriousness\nthat something is law, and that we can describe that facticity without\nassessing its merits.\n\nEvaluative argument is, of course, central to the philosophy of law\nmore generally. No legal philosopher can be only a legal\npositivist. A complete understanding of law requires also an account\nof what kinds of things could possibly count as the merits of law\n(must law be efficient or elegant as well as just?); of what role law\nshould play in adjudication (should valid law always be applied?); of\nwhat claim law has on our obedience (is there a duty to obey?); and\nalso the more practical questions of what laws we should have and\nwhether we should have law at all. Legal positivism does not aspire to\nanswer these questions (although cf. Murphy 2014: 88\u2013108 for the\nargument that the theory has important first-order implications for\nlegal practice). Nonetheless, positivism\u2019s claim that the\nexistence and content of law depends only on social facts does give\nthem shape.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Austin, John, 1832 [1995], <em>Austin: The Province of\nJurisprudence Determined</em>, Wilfrid E.
