    "main_text": "The Regress Argument\n1. The Regress Argument\n\nRyle\u2019s most famous objection to intellectualist accounts of\nskills and knowledge-how is that they lead to a vicious regress: \n\n\nThe consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution\nof which can be more or less intelligent, less or more stupid. But if,\nfor any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical\noperation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it\nwould be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the\ncircle. (1949: 19)\n\n\nRyle concludes: \n\n\n\u201cIntelligent\u201d cannot be defined in terms of\n\u201cintellectual\u201d or \u201cknowing how\u201d in terms of\n\u201cknowing that\u201d, (1949: 20) \n\n\non pain of a vicious regress (see also Ryle 1946: 22). Exactly how to\nreconstruct Ryle\u2019s argument is a matter of controversy (Stanley\n& Williamson 2001; Stanley 2011b; Bengson & Moffett 2011a;\nCath 2013; Fantl 2011; Kremer 2020). The next sections discuss\ndifferent possible ways of understanding the regress challenge and\npossible responses on behalf of intellectualism.\n",
