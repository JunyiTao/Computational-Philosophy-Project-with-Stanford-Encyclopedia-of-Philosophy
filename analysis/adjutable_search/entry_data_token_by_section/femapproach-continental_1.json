    "main_text": "Continental Feminism and Black Feminist Thought\n2. Continental Feminism and Black Feminist Thought\n\nThis section on the convergences between Black and Continental\nfeminist thought begins with a discussion about the history of Black\nfeminist scholarship utilizing existential/phenomenological,\npsychoanalytic, critical, and hermeneutic approaches. It then\nintroduces intersectionality as the major heuristic for Black feminist\ntheorizing, and concludes by highlighting emerging areas and\nintersections between Black studies and Black feminist Continental\nthought.\n\nBlack women have long been contributors to the Continental\nphilosophical tradition. One may argue that their contributions to\nprofessional philosophy started after the graduation of the first\nBlack woman to earn the PhD in philosophy, Joyce Mitchell Cook, who\ncompleted the degree in 1965 from Princeton University. Even prior to\nthis date, however, Black women engaged in projects that we can\nrecognize as Continental feminist projects. Importantly,\n\n\nmany Black intellectuals in the United States going back (at least) to\nthe nineteenth century offered what are now described as existential,\nphenomenological, and/or genealogical analyses of race and racism.\n(Belle 2012, 329 fn. 1)\n\n\nThese contributions did not always occur in the form of traditional\nphilosophical discussions, nor are they always created by those who\nhave professional degrees in philosophy, which is certainly true of\nthe nineteenth and early twentieth century thinkers, Sojourner Truth,\nMaria W. Stewart, and\n Anna Julia Cooper.\n\nBlack feminists\u2019 contributions to Continental philosophy\ndemonstrate the ways in which their voices are crucial to both shaping\nand expanding the discipline. Kathryn Sophia Belle, Donna-Dale\nMarcano, and Maria del Guadalupe Davidson edited Convergences:\nBlack Feminism and Continental Philosophy (del Guadalupe et al.\n2010), the only text at the publication of this entry that addresses\nboth these topics simultaneously. For the editors, the concept of\nconvergence is demonstrated by the natural, historical, and necessary\nengagement of Black women with Continental philosophy. Belle\nwrites,\n\n\nBlack feminist and womanist thinkers inevitably address the very same\nissues of agency, identity, alienation, power, and so on that are\nraised in much recent Continental philosophy. Likewise, from Immanuel\nKant to the feminist thinkers of the present, Continental philosophy\nhas engaged, to some extent, with issues of race and gender. (2010:\n5)\n\n\nThe Black feminist tradition in Continental philosophy demonstrates\nthat Black women are not strangers nor enemies of Continental\nphilosophy; rather, their unique theoretical positioning affords them\nthe opportunity to utilize, challenge, and expand the tradition.\n\nBlack feminist thinkers contribute to Continental feminist thought in\nat least two ways. First, they engage directly with Continental\nfigures and theories. For example, Lorraine Hansberry comments that\nSimone de Beauvoir\u2019s The Second Sex (1949, translated\nin 1953) was arguably the \u201cmost important work of this\ncentury\u201d (1957 [1995: 129 and 133]), and Antillean thinker\nPaulette Nardal draws on both features of the Harlem Renaissance and\nexistentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre to provide a\nphenomenological and genealogical account of how the Black race, and\nAntilleans in particular, have come to understand their own notion of\nrace consciousness in \u201cThe Awakening of Race\nConsciousness\u201d (1932). More recently, they engage with canonical\nfigures and ideologies of Continental philosophy, as in the work of\nKathryn Sophia Belle on Hannah Arendt (2014) or Kris Sealey on\nEmmanuel Levinas (2014). Second, regardless of their professional\nPhilosophy degrees or lack thereof, Black feminist thinkers utilize\nthe tools of the Continental tradition as part of their\ninterdisciplinary approaches, as in the use of Foucault in the work of\nSylvia Wynter (2003) and the use of Freud, Lacan, and psychoanalysis\nin the work of Hortense Spillers (1996).\n\nBlack feminist thinkers have frequently used intersectionality as an\neffective entry-point into conversations with the Continental\ntradition. Intersectionality is a Black feminist theory that describes\nthe oppression that Black women experience as a result of lying at the\nnexus of simultaneously impactful identities, such as that of race,\ngender, class, and sexuality. As such, intersectionality can be used\nas a phenomenological tool to describe Black women\u2019s lived\nexperience of oppression. While legal theorist Kimberl\u00e9\nCrenshaw coined the term in 1989, the theory has been articulated at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century in Sojourner Truth\u2019s\nproclamation, \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d (1851). In the\nspeech, Truth highlights that Black women are treated with less\nrespect than white women while bearing the same burdens of racism as\nBlack men. Anna Julia Cooper wrote that Black women are\n\n\nconfronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is as yet\nan unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both. (1892 [1988: 134])\n\n\nIn their collective statement from April 1977, The Combahee River\nCollective argues that\n\n\nBlack feminism [is] the logical political movement to combat the\nmanifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face\n\n\nand that\n\n\n[t]here is also undeniably a personal genesis for Black feminism, that\nis, the political realization that comes from the seemingly personal\nexperiences of individual Black women\u2019s lives. (Taylor 2017: 15\nand 17)\n\n\nIntersectionality is thus a hallmark of Black feminist thought because\nit prioritizes the lived experiences of Black women. In doing so, it\nsupplies the tools to think about the extent to which one\u2019s\nconsciousness the world is informed by experiences of racism, sexism,\nclassism, and homophobia.\n\nIn addition to its utility in explaining Black women\u2019s lived\nexperience, intersectionality also provides tools for Black feminists\nto critique the presumed whiteness and bourgeois-class status of\nfeminism and to combat various forms of oppression and violence. Thus,\nintersectionality is also key to critiquing phenomenological analysis,\nthat is, analysis of lived experiences and feminist movements through\nthe lens of sociopolitical identities such as race, sex, and class.\nAngela Davis\u2019s text Women, Race, & Class (1981) is\nan early model of this approach; it details the history of U.S.\nwomen\u2019s movements and their consideration, or lack thereof, of\nthe class-based and racial dimensions of womanhood. Texts such as\nPatricia Hill-Collins\u2019s Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge,\nConsciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment (1990 [2015]) underscore\nthe ways in which Black women create their own epistemological\nstandpoint as a result of their lived experiences. In the 1970s to\n90s, when Black women\u2019s contributions to academia reached its\nzenith, Black feminist scholars such as Barbara Christian in\n\u201cThe Race for Theory\u201d (1988), Toni Morrison in Playing\nin the Dark (1992), and Audre Lorde in \u201cThe Master\u2019s\nTools will Never Dismantle the Master\u2019s House\u201d (1984a) and\n\u201cAge, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference\u201d\n(1984b) exemplified Black women\u2019s critiques of theoretical\napproaches that adopt a \u201cneutral\u201d stance toward feminist\nmovements where neutral meant presuming all women to be white,\nmiddle-class, young or middle-aged, and heterosexual (see also Hull,\nBell-Scott, & Smith 1982).\n\nCurrent Black feminist work centers Black epistemologies,\npractices, and concepts. The burgeoning scholarship of Black women\nphilosophers continue to push the boundaries of Continental feminism,\nas in the work of Lindsey Stewart\u2019s work on Black feminist\npractices of freedom (2017), Camisha Russell\u2019s work on the\nissues of race and gender in assisted reproduction (2018), and Axelle\nKarera\u2019s work, which focuses on the Anthropocene and\nantiBlackness (2019). In addition to engaging with the canonical\nfigures of the Continental tradition, Black thinkers harvest\nphilosophy from their own perspective and experience of the world as\nwell as their theoretical archives. Much of this more recent work\nintersects with Black Studies. The work of Black thinkers from\ndisciplines other than philosophy are intersecting with Continental\nphilosophical and feminist approaches, as seen in the works of such as\nSaidiya Hartman (1997, 2007, and 2019), Christina Sharpe (2016),\nRizvana Bradley (2014 and 2018), Jennifer Nash (2019), Denise Ferreira\nda Silva (2007, 2014, and 2018), Riley Snorton (2017), Selamawit\nTerrefe (2020), and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020).\n",
