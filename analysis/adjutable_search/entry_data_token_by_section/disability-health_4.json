    "main_text": "Disability and Well-Being || The Claimed Neutrality of Disability\n1.4 The Claimed Neutrality of Disability\n\nMany plausible accounts of well-being can explain why life can and\noften does go comparably well for people with most disabilities\nrelative to people without disabilities. There are unresolved issues\nabout how broadly the objective elements of well-being can be framed\nwithout becoming so broad as to lose distinct content. But these\nquestions may be less about disability and more about objective list\ntheories generally.\n\nSome philosophers have argued more affirmatively that disabilities are\n\u201cneutral\u201d characteristics or \u201cmere\ndifferences\u201d, with no average or generally adverse impact on\nwell-being. They argue that disability should be regarded as a\ncharacteristic like race or sex, which are widely seen as neutral with\nrespect to well-being, once discrimination and its effects are\nfactored out\u2014or even if they are not. Disability is grouped with\nthese characteristics in anti-discrimination law. But it is also\ngrouped with those characteristics by writers who argue, more\nambitiously, that disability, no less than race or sex, is a neutral\ncharacteristic\u2014one that, in the absence of social exclusion,\ndoes not make lives go any worse on average (Barnes 2009a;\nMcBryde-Johnson 2003).\nThese writers do not deny that becoming disabled may make life go\nworse for some time, but no more so than other wrenching changes, like\nlosing a job, home, or loved one. In the former case as well as the\nlatter, the bad or harm is in the transition\u2014in the loss and\ndisruption\u2014and not in the end state. Any disadvantage that\npersists after the transition is plausibly attributed to social\nfactors.\n\nThere are various ways to distinguish disabilities, on the one hand,\nfrom neutral characteristics like race and sex, on the other. The\ndistinction can be easily made on a maximalist view of well-being\nwhich holds that life is presumptively better with more valuable\ncapacities. In contrast to race and sex, disabilities, by definition,\ninvolve fewer valuable capacities, so they presumptively make life go\nworse. It is simply better to have more senses, more intelligence, and\na greater range of motion, even if they do not make one happier, have\nlimited practical value, and do not advance one\u2019s specific\nprojects. This view regards standard disabilities as among the most\nsalient limitations to which humanity is subject. Less is always\nworse, although how much worse will depend on contingent\ncircumstances. But many philosophers reject maximalism, in part\nbecause they balk at the implication that we should strive to acquire,\nand bear children who will possess, the greatest number and range of\npossible capacities. \n\nJeff McMahan offers a non-maximalist argument against the neutrality\nof disabilities, based on a view of how people with single impairments\nflourish despite them:\n\n\nA single disability may seem neutral because it can be compensated for\nby other abilities that develop to fulfill its functions. Blindness,\nfor example, may be compensated for by the enhancement of other\nsenses, particularly hearing. But if disabilities were individually\nentirely neutral, they ought also to be neutral in combination; but\nthey are not (2005: 96).\n\n\nSome might dispute McMahan\u2019s claim that disabilities cannot be\nneutral in combination, but our focus here is his claim that\nneutrality for individual disabilities implies neutrality in\ncombination. In support of this claim, he argues the effects of\ndisabilities on well-being \u201care largely additive\u201d, because\nwith each further disability, it becomes harder to compensate for\nother disabilities. This argument assumes that the possibility of\nliving as well without as with any given ability depends on the\npossibility of compensating for its absence. This assumption may be\nmistaken: the possibility of flourishing with a single disability may\ndepend not on compensation but on what we could call\n\u201csaturation\u201d. A blind person can live as well as a sighted\none not because she develops better hearing\u2014she may\nnot\u2014but just because the senses and abilities she has are more\nthan adequate to allow her to live as fully and richly as possible. As\nAsch and Wasserman argue:\n\n\n[H]uman beings enjoy a fortunate redundancy in many of the capacities\nthat are instrumental for, or constitutive of, valuable human goods\nand activities, from intimate relationships to rewarding work. Humans\nwith a standard complement of senses and motor functions rarely use\nall of these functions in achieving such goods, and humans lacking\nthose skills can use only some. But those are usually sufficient (2005: 208\n).\n\n\nThere may be a limited number of ways to realize important human goods\nlike rich aesthetic experience, and those with disabilities may have\nfewer ways to do so. But the ways they have may be as good as the ways\nthey lack, and employing the ones they have need not be seen as\ncompensating for their inability to employ the ones they lack. Having\nmore ways to realize a good does not mean that you can realize it more\nfully.\n\nThis response, however, suggests two final sources of difference, both\nof which involve what we might call \u201cwelfare security\u201d.\nEven if people with a single major disability can live as well as\npeople without one, 1) it requires more effort or luck for them to do\nso, and 2) they are at greater risk of lacking the means to do so. The\nfirst claim is that the fewer means there are to achieve a particular\ngood like rich aesthetic experience, the more difficult it may be to\nachieve it. An individual who can meet his aesthetic quota, so to\nspeak, with sunsets or symphonies, doesn\u2019t have to work as hard\nor need as aesthetically rich an environment as one who can meet his\nquota only with symphonies. The second claim is that people with\nsingle disabilities are at greater risk than people without any\ndisabilities of losing the means to achieve various goods, since they\nhave a smaller surplus or reserve. The plausibility of these claims\ndepends on a myriad of unresolved issues: Is there an irreducible\nplurality of objective goods and if so, how they are individuated? Are\nthere a limited number of means for attaining those goods? If it\nrequires greater effort to attain a particular good with fewer\nfunctions, does that additional effort itself enhance or reduce\nwell-being?\n\nAnother argument for the conclusion that disabilities entail setbacks\nto well-being is suggested by the human variation model (Scotch and\nShriner 1997). This treats disabilities not as a distinct category,\nbut as conditions falling on a continuum of physical or mental\ndifference. It is not intrinsically disadvantageous to be near the end\nof such a continuum but may be disadvantageous in a society in which\nonly a small proportion of people fall near that end. This is because\nmany of the physical structures and social practices of that society\nwill inevitably be designed for its average members. No matter how\njust a society, how committed to inclusion, there would still be some\ndisadvantage in being toward the end of the spectrum. There may be\nsome truth to this claim, but it is easy to overstate. Universal\ndesign advocates argue that it is, or will become, feasible to build\nstructures and practices that fully or equally accommodate individuals\nacross large ranges of human variation. Even if their claims are also\noverstated, they suggest a need for caution in concluding that\nminority status is intrinsically disadvantageous.\n\nPerhaps the most tenacious source of resistance to the \u201cmere\ndifference\u201d claim comes from a stubborn asymmetry, which appears to\ndistinguish disability from race and sex and to challenge its\nneutrality. We generally seek to prevent individuals who are not\ndisabled from becoming disabled, but not vice-versa. We strongly\nsupport measures to prevent disability, if prevention can be\naccomplished without coercion, harmful side effects, or the loss or\ndisruption of personal or narrative identity. Consider a form of\nprevention widely seen as unproblematic: taking folic acid during\npregnancy to prevent spina bifida. Some governments mandate that\ncertain food be enriched with folic acid. These mandates are\ncontroversial, but the controversy concerns the issues of involuntary\nmedication and possible side-effects rather than the intended\npreventative effect. Few, if any, disability advocates object to these\nmandates, any more than they object to the myriad safety measures\nimposed by the modern state, from requiring seat belts to restricting\nteratogenic drugs. Many object to the needlessly grim depiction of\ndisability in some safety campaigns; few to the campaigns\nthemselves (Emens 2012).\n\nNo such asymmetry exists for other allegedly neutral characteristics.\nThere would be strong opposition to government measures to prevent\nthem, alter them, or reduce their incidence. Imagine that a dietary\nsupplement as safe as folic acid could alter the sex of the fetus, or\nlighten its complexion. We suspect that most people would find it\ntroublesome for pregnant women to take that drug voluntarily, let\nalone for the government to put it in the food supply. Or imagine a\nfluoride-like substance with a similar effect, which could be safely\nadded to the water supply. Fluoridation to prevent female sex or dark\nskin would strike most people as offensive, even though it would not\nprevent the existence of anyone on the basis of a disfavored\ncharacteristic, at least if personal identity survives alteration of\nrace or sex. The claim that women or people of color lead worse lives\non average due to pervasive discrimination would not be seen as a\njustification for changing sex or race. Undertaken by an individual,\nit would be seen as complicit with sexism or racism regardless of its\nmotivation; undertaken by the state, it would be seen as an egregious\nexpression of racism or sexism. Public health measures to prevent\ndisability, like dietary supplements, would not provoke similar\nobjections. In general, measures to alter other significant\ncharacteristics\u2014not only race and sex, but minority cultures,\nsexual orientations, and social identities\u2014would be considered\nunjustifiable or only justifiable in special circumstances. By\ncontrast, measures to prevent disabilities are considered\npresumptively acceptable.\n\nThe contrast between sex and race, on one hand, and disability on the\nother, is especially striking in light of the fact that in the former,\nmeasures to alter stigmatized social identities are often regarded as\nmore objectionable than measures to alter dominant social identities\nthat are not stigmatized. Just the reverse is true for disability.\nGiving deaf children cochlear implants is somewhat controversial;\ndeafening hearing children would be considered criminal abuse. And\nthis would be so even if the children were too young to have the\nself-conscious experience of hearing, had no other effects from being\ndeafened, and faced no discrimination on the basis of deafness. These\ncontrasts raise the question of whether the asymmetry with respect to\ndisability-prevention is compatible with the view that disabilities\nare neutral characteristics\u2014that they do not make life go worse\noverall.\n\nRecently, Elizabeth Barnes has sought to challenge this perceived\nasymmetry between measures to prevent or correct disabilities and\nother significant characteristics. She attributes much of the\nobjection to changing sex or gender to moral considerations equally\napplicable to \u201ccorrecting\u201d disability: 1) they would\nviolate the individual\u2019s right to control her own body unless\nconsented to; if consented to, they would be permissible elective\nprocedures (as would, Barnes maintains, procedures to create\ndisabilities); and 2) such procedures generally involve considerable\nloss and transition costs\u2014but so do procedures to correct\ndisabilities, as many \u201ccure\u201d narratives attest. For\npreventative measures not involving bodily modification, loss, or\ntransition costs, Barnes argues that the claimed difference between\npreventing disabilities and preventing less favored races or sexual\norientations is simply question-begging\u2014no good reason has been\ngiven to accept the former and reject the latter, merely the\n\u201cnegative-difference\u201d view the intuition is supposed to\nsupport. \n\nBarnes\u2019 argument, not surprisingly, has proven controversial.\nSeveral commentators sympathetic with mere-difference claims for some\ndisabilities have questioned Barnes categorical claim for all\ndisabilities; others have questioned whether she is too quick to\naccuse those claiming an asymmetry in the case of preventative\nmeasures of begging the question (see Dougherty 2014).\n\nYet even if disability could be regarded as neutral if other features\ncontingently associated with it, such as social exclusion, physical\npain, and the loss of valued functions, are factored out, that\nconclusion might have limited practical significance for decision\nmakers who cannot factor out those features. As noted earlier, the\nquestion of whether it is disadvantageous may have a different answer\nfor those who can significantly modify the physical and social\nenvironment and those who cannot. Many decision makers, from\nprospective parents to healthcare policy makers, will fall in the\nlatter category.\n\nBefore discussing specific decision making contexts, then, we need to\nconsider arguments that significant disabilities can be neutral, in\nthe sense of not reducing overall well-being, even if various\ncontingent harmful features are not excluded. We will examine two\ngrounds for claiming that disabilities, including painful, disruptive,\nand stigmatized ones, need not reduce overall well-being, although\nthey may still be conditions worth preventing: 1) if disabilities deny\nsome valuable experiences and achievements, they provide others, which\nmay not be accessible, or may be less accessible, to nondisabled\npeople; and 2) there is a non-additive relationship between parts or\naspects of a life and life as a whole.\n\nBarnes (2009a) argues that having a disability can make an\nindividual\u2019s life more difficult and challenging at some points\nwithout making it go worse overall, or even making it more probable\nthat it will. The challenges of disability are like those of other\nminority characteristics such as homosexuality; facing those\nchallenges can give a life greater depth or direction. For example,\nsome individuals who are disabled in adolescence or adulthood find\nthat their previously shallow or aimless lives gained focus and\npurpose from the challenges they faced, and some individuals find that\nthey acquired new skills or interests more rewarding than those\nprecluded by their impairments. Because such enriching responses are\nso common, there is no basis for concluding that people with\ndisabilities have a lower quality of life overall. But because\ndisabilities \n\n\nare, in general, the kinds of things that make life harder\u2014they\nimpose limitations, they cause pain, they subject their bearers to\nstigmas and discrimination (2009a: 339) \n\n\n\u2014they are associated with with harms and should be prevented in\nsome circumstances. They should not, however, be regarded as\n\u201cnegative difference-makers\u201d\u2014conditions that\nnecessarily make lives worse overall.\n\nIn blocking the inference from disability as a harm to disability as a\nnegative difference-maker, Barnes adduces instances of the positive\nconsequences that disabilities have had for specific individuals,\ndespite or sometimes because of the \u201clocal\u201d hardships they\ncause. It may be, however, that no positive consequences are needed to\n\u201cneutralize\u201d the hardships associated with a disability.\nThose hardships may simply get absorbed in the immense complex of\nfactors that make a life go better or worse. It is only on a simple\nadditive view of the relationship of parts to whole that a local harm\nwould necessarily make a life go worse unless compensated for. It is\ndifficult to be more precise about the impact of disability on whole\nlives, however, because it is not clear how the goodness or badness of\nparts of a life contribute to the goodness of the whole, on either\nobjective or subjective accounts of well-being (Feldman 2008). David Velleman has argued\nthat whatever one\u2019s particular theory of individual well-being,\nthe parts of a life do not contribute to the goodness of a life\nadditively. That is, the goodness of a whole life is not the sum of\nthe goodness of its parts. Instead, the goodness of a whole life is to\nbe understood in terms of the narrative relations between its various\nparts. From this perspective, successes or failures at particular\ntimes in one\u2019s life can retrospectively alter the meaning or\nsignificance of earlier ones (Velleman 1991).\n\nRecent accounts of noncomparative harm (Harman 2009; Shiffrin 2012,\n1999) provide additional reasons to challenge the inference from\ndisability as harm to disability as negative difference-maker. These\naccounts reject the prevailing, counterfactual analysis of harm as a\nsetback to an individual\u2019s interests with reference to some\nbaseline\u2014her past, her expectations, or the average of her group\nor society. Instead, they understand harms as fundamentally bad states\nor events, like pain, disability, and death; states or events that\n(proponents of these accounts claim) can be regarded as bad without\nreference to any baseline. On these views, an individual is harmed\nmerely by suffering pain or injury, regardless of whether that pain or\ninjury leaves her worse off overall. She is harmed by painful\nlife-saving surgery, although that averts a greater harm, or\nlife-transforming disability, although her life may go much better as\na result.\n\nObviously a critical question for these accounts is what makes\nsomething a noncomparative harm (Bradley 2012). Harman (2009) offers\nno general characterization of noncomparative harms; Shiffrin\ncharacterizes such harms in terms of a significant chasm, conflict, or\nother form of significant disconnect between one\u2019s will and\none\u2019s circumstances (2012: 388). Disabilities, injuries, and\nillnesses and typically regarded as harms in these terms because they\n\u201coften significantly impede one\u2019s capacity to achieve\nsubstantial congruity between one\u2019s will and one\u2019s life\n(2012: 384). Shiffrin recognizes both that one\u2019s circumstances\nmay narrow that chasm considerably, and she considers it a strength of\nher account \u201cthat it can recognize quotidian conditions such as\nordinary conditions as harms\u201d (2012: 387, n. 46). Although\nShiffrin does not take this additional step, it would seem that if\nordinary conditions can be harmful in damaging one\u2019s agency,\nextraordinary ones can be harmless, if they were congenital,\npredictable, or successfully adapted to, such that congruity between\none\u2019s will and one\u2019s life is never lost, or is quickly\nrestored. Further, although Harman and Shiffrin, like Barnes, regard\nthe onset of most disabilities as harms, they also, like Barnes, hold\nthat such harms need not make life go worse overall.\n\nAnother factor associated with disability\u2014reduced\nlifespan\u2014arguably has an adverse impact on well-being. Many\ndisabilities, or their associated disease processes, result in\nlower-than-average life expectancy, though it is worth emphasizing\nthat the relationship between disability and reduced lifespan is\ncontingent, and so even if reduced lifespan necessarily reduces\nwell-being, it would not follow that disability necessarily reduces\nwell-being. Moreover, it is not clear that reduced lifespan\nnecessarily reduces well-being. It is at least arguable that living to\n80, with the last 5 years of one\u2019s life in severe pain, does not\nyield more well-being than a life of 75 relatively painless years. And\nit is at least arguable that longer lives correlate with greater\nwell-being because they enable one to pass through all of life\u2019s\nstages\u2014childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle age, and\ngradual aging\u2014but that having passed through all of life\u2019s\nstages, additional years yield small increases in well-being. Clearly,\nthese are complicated issues that deserve more attention. We simply\nnote that there is no straightforward inference to be drawn from\ndisability\u2019s correlation with reduced lifespan to\ndisability\u2019s having an adverse effect on well-being. \n",
