    "main_text": "Are zombies conceivable?\n4. Are zombies conceivable?\n\nThose who exploited the zombie idea in the 1970s typically assumed\nwithout argument that zombies are not just conceivable but possible\n(e. g. Campbell 1970, Nagel 1970). When Chalmers reactivated the idea\nhe found the conceivability of zombies \u2018obvious\u2019,\nremarking that \u2018it certainly seems that a coherent situation is\ndescribed; I can discern no contradiction in the description\u2019\n(1996, p. 96). However, he also recognized that this intuition cannot\nbe relied on. The nature of conscious experience is after all hard to\nunderstand: what strikes some people as obviously possible could still\nturn out to harbour hidden contradictions (Nagel 1998; Stoljar 2001).\nClearly, those who maintain that zombies are conceivable must provide\njustification, recognizing that, being an epistemic claim dependent on\nour cognitive abilities, it is defeasible.\n",
