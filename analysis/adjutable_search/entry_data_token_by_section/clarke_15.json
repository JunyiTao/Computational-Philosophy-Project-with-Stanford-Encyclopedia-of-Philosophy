    "main_text": "Ethics\n5. Ethics\n\nAlthough some of his sermons contain interesting analyses of\nindividual Christian virtues, the most sustained exposition of\nClarke\u2019s deontological, rationalist ethics is contained in his\nsecond set of Boyle Lectures, A Discourse Concerning the\nUnalterable Obligations of Natural Religion. Clarke begins by\nstating that clearly there are different relations among persons and\nthat from these relations there arise a \u201cfitness\u201d or\n\u201cunfitness\u201d of behavior among persons. So, for example,\ngiven the relation of infinite disproportion between humans and God,\nit is fit that we honor, worship, and imitate God. These facts can be\nrationally apprehended by anyone with a sound mind, although in some\ncases we may be at a loss in clearly demarcating right from wrong.\nBeing grounded in necessary relations, ethical truths, like\ngeometrical truths, are universal and necessary. As such, they are\nindependent of any will, divine or human, and of any consideration of\npunishment or reward.\n\nIn somewhat more detail, the central tenets of Clarke\u2019s ethics\nare elucidated in the subordinate components of the first proposition\nof A Discourse.\n\nThere are eternal and necessary differences (or\n\u201creasons\u201d) of things, from which \u201cnecessarily arises\nan agreement or disagreement of some things with\nothers, or a fitness or unfitness of the application\nof different things or different relations one to another\u201d (W\n2.608).\nGod wills to act according to these eternal reasons of things (W\n2.612).\nAll rational creatures should choose to act according to the\neternal rule of reason (by which Clarke seems to mean these eternal\nrelations) (W 2.612), and the human mind \u201cnaturally and\nnecessarily Assents to the eternal Law of Righteousness\u201d (W\n2.616).\nThis eternal law is classified into piety (duty toward God),\nrighteousness (duty to other human persons), and sobriety (duty to\noneself) (W 2.618).\nThis law of nature is (temporally and logically) prior to and\nindependent of human interaction (W 2.624).\nIt is also (logically) prior to and independent of the will of God\n(W 2.626).\nThe obligation to follow this law is \u201cantecedent to all\nConsideration of any particular private and personal Reward or\nPunishment\u201d (W 2.627).\n\n\nFrom (3) and in clarification of sobriety and piety in (4), Clarke\nargues the ideal (created) moral agent is one who acts within the\nscope of what God, with full authority and compatibly with reason, has\ncommanded. For instance, we ought to preserve our own being because\nGod has created us and sustains us and only God ought to remove us\nfrom the world (Heydt 2018, 135). Regarding (4), Clarke argues that\nduties toward others are governed by equity, which demands that one\ndeal with other persons as one can reasonably expect others to deal\nwith one (W 2.619), and by love, which demands that one further the\nwell-being happiness of all persons (W 2.621). Duties towards oneself\ndemand that one preserve one\u2019s physical health, mental\nfaculties, and spiritual well-being so as to be able to perform\none\u2019s duties (W 2.623). Clarke uses (5) as an opportunity to\ndevelop a series of interesting attacks on Hobbes\u2019 account of\npolitical and moral obligation. Among his many criticisms, he argues\nthat a social contract cannot be obligatory unless there were already\nan obligation to obey contracts; if a contract benefits the community\nthen there are real benefits prior to the contract so the contract\ndoes not generate benefits and harms; it is a contradiction for\neveryone to have a right to the same thing in the state of nature; and\nif power is to be obeyed then an all-powerful devil should be obeyed,\nwhich is absurd (W 2.609\u2013616, 631\u2013638).\n\nIn clarification of (6), Clarke adds that because God always does what\nis just and good, God\u2019s commands align with the eternal law (W\n2.637), and that because God wants to make us happy and good, God\npromotes the goodness and welfare of the whole of creation, including\nus (W 2.640). While the law is antecedent to considerations of reward\nand punishment (7), God\u2019s justice ensures the proper rewards and\npunishments for following the law (W 2.641). These sanctions are not\nuniformly present in this life, so the reward and punishment must (at\nleast partly) occur in the next life. Moreover, human depravity makes\nthe prospect of future sanctions a necessary incentive for proper\nbehavior. God might also ensure that our acting from the best reasons\ndoes not have overall much worse consequences (Schneewind 1997,\n317).\n\nClarke\u2019s theory has been roundly criticized on several grounds,\nespecially on the meaning and sufficiency of (1). He never adequately\nexplained the nature of the relations among persons that ground\nmorality. For instance, his explanation for why it is\n\u201cfit\u201d to honor, worship, obey, and imitate God is that\n\u201cGod is infinitely superior to Men\u201d (W\n2.608). If the infinite superiority is in reference to power or being,\nit is not obviously to the point; if it is an expression of an ethical\nrelation, the argument is circular. Additionally, it is unclear what\nin the \u201cNature and Reason of Things\u201d is necessary. Is it\nthat good is necessarily not evil? (This is trivial and unhelpful.) Is\nit that one thing cannot be both good from one perspective and evil\nfrom another? (In which case, Clarke is offering a response to Hobbes\nor maybe Spinoza, but he doesn\u2019t provide a substantial\nalternative.) Is it that whatever is good is necessarily good? (In\nwhich case, he is perhaps restating his opposition to divine command\ntheory, but again not in a way that makes clear his alternative.) Is\nit something else? Clarke\u2019s position is not clear, but he does\nseem to affirm each of these interpretations at different times. A\nfurther structural problem is that Clarke slides between the claim\nthat ethical truths are relations between mind-independent objects in\nthe world, and that they are grounded in the nature of rationality\nitself, apparently without distinguishing the two positions.\nRelatedly, there is an interpretive question about whether Clarke is\nontologically committed to the existence of mind-independent values\nthat are not reducible to anything in the world (Kelly 2002). Finally,\neven if these relations exist, it is not clear how moral obligation\narises from such relations. Hume (1739, 3.1.1.3\u20137) famously\ncharged theories like Clarke\u2019s with motivational impotence\nbecause the perception of \u201cfitness\u201d cannot, by itself,\nmove the will. However, as we saw, Clarke denied that evaluation\ncauses motivation, although he clearly thought that evaluation\nprovides the agent, who ultimately causes the volition, with reasons\nfor action.\n",
