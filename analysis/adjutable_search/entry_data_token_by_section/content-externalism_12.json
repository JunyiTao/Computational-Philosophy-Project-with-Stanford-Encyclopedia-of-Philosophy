The Scope of Extended Mind\n\nIn its earlier incarnations, the scope of extended mind was\nrelatively restricted, it being understood, primarily, as a thesis\nabout cognition. The types of external structure or activity involved\nin developing the idea of extended mind reflected this focus on\ncognition. They were predominantly thought of as structures that\ncarried information pertinent to the solution of cognitive tasks that\nan organism might face, where the organism, through acting on these\nstructures, could transform this information from information merely\npresent in the structures to information that is available to the\norganism (Rowlands 2010). Accordingly, expansion in the scope of\nextended mind can, and has, occurred along two (related)\ndimensions: (1) expansion in scope from cognition to other kinds of\nmental process, and (2) expansion in the types of external structure\ninvolve in these extended mental processes.\n\nSome prominent advocates of extended cognitive states or processes\nhave been skeptical of the idea that consciousness could be extended,\noften on the grounds that external structures do not possess the kind\nof informational bandwidth necessary to sustain conscious experience\n(Clark 2009, Chalmers 2019). Others are more sanguine about this\npossibility, and extended accounts of experiences (Rowlands 2010) and\nother conscious states, such as emotions (Krueger 2014; Krueger &\nSzanto 2016; Carter et al. 2016) have been defended. At the same time,\nand relatedly, there has been an expansion in the types of external\nstructures thought relevant. In particular, there has been a\npronounced social turn in extended mind in recent\nyears, exploring the ways in which social structures and institutions\nmight also, in part, be constitutive of constitute mental processes\n(De Jaegher et al. 2010, Gallagher 2013, Lyre 2018, and Slors 2019),\nand the idea that our basic biological cognitive faculties may be\ntransformed by a process of enculturation (Menary 2015) has\nhelped reshape extended mind in recent years. One important\nexample of this social turn pertains to the study of memory, in\nparticular, in the way in which memory is often\ntransactive\u2014involving the combined efforts of two or\nmore people, bonded together as a coupled system (Barnier et al \n2008; Sutton 2008, 2010, 2015).\n",
