    "main_text": "Aristotle\n4. Aristotle\n\nThe two Platonic themes of superior political knowledge and, expressed\nparticularly in his Laws, political participation, also\nstructure the political thought of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), who\nstudied in Plato\u2019s Academy as a youth and researched there for\nmany years thereafter. Living much of his life as a resident alien in\nAthens, with close familial ties to the extra-polis\nMacedonian court which would, near the end of his life, bring Athens\nunder its sway, Aristotle at once thematized the fundamental\nperspective of the Greek citizenship of equals and at the same time\nacknowledged the claim to rule of anyone of truly superior political\nknowledge. While building on Plato\u2019s project of demarcating\npolitical expertise and depicting ideal as well as imperfect cities,\nthe advances and new directions that Aristotle pioneered in political\nphilosophy reflect certain disagreements with Plato in their wider\nphilosophies, though also with some deep commonalities.\n",
