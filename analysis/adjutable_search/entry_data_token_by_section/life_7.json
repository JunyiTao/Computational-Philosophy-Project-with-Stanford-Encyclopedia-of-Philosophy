    "main_text": "Ethics, Law, and Politics\n7. Ethics, Law, and Politics\n\n\nThe term \u2018life\u2019 is important outside of biology. Often,\nthe focus is not on the concept of life or life in general, but on the\nstatus of individual living entities. Typically, the focus is on the\nbeginning and end stages of individual lives, which raises legal,\nreligious, and moral questions. The start of an individual life\nhas been the source of contraception and abortion discussions \n(Noonan 1967, Dellapenna 1978). Unfortunately, developmental biology\ndoes not provide an uncontroversial starting point for when\n\u2018life\u2019 begins (Maienschein 2014). The end of individual lives was also a heated debate in the 20th century as new technologies were\nable to keep human bodies alive long after they would have died in\nnature (DeGrazia 2016).\nAny discussion of defining life in these contexts should begin by\ndistinguishing between life and other phenomena that are often\nconflated with it in public discourse, such as sentience, personhood,\nand moral considerability. It\u2019s unclear how much ontological,\nepistemic, or moral weight the category of life has independently of\nother properties. Attributing moral worth to non-living entities is\nstill a minority position in environmental or comparative philosophy\n(but see Leopold 1949, Basl 2019). Thus, a starting position might be\nthat life is a prerequisite for moral considerability. Nonetheless,\nmost humans don\u2019t mind killing bacteria for the sake of\ncleanliness and many people eat or wear the flesh of animals. So, in\nmany discussions, life is only valuable when it is the vehicle for\nother equally nebulous properties like sentience, personhood, or\nimmaterial souls.\nIf any living entities have a distinct moral or ontological status,\nmost philosophers would accept that humans are among them (Rolston\n1975, Goodpaster 1978). In these contexts, it matters when individual\nhumans come into being and acquire such a status in their own right, be\nit conception, birth, or some time period in between. Considered\nopinions differ as to when this occurs and in virtue of what, be it\nmere possibility of self-sustained life, sentience, or other features.\nThere is still a rampant pro-life/pro-choice split in cultural\npolitics, which is somewhat lessened in European countries (Corbella\n2020). There are equivalent, but less tendentious analogues in the\ncontexts of euthanasia, the death penalty, war, and the prevention of\ndeath and disease. In these debates, both ethical and metaphysical\ncommitments matter.\nThe public questions of life are often raised by new technologies.\nIn the abortion discussion above, for example, new techniques to end\npregnancies, from birth control to abortion procedures, as well as new\nmedical technologies facilitating premature deliveries made the topic\nmore contentious. Other technological innovations also raise questions\nabout life. One such area is that of transhumanism  (c.f. More and\nVita-More 2013). Transhumanism is the movement aimed toward the use of\ntechnology for the human enhancement of social, psychological, and\nphysical lives. These can range from prosthetics to implants or from\npharmaceuticals to mental \u2018uploading.\u2019 There are\nbioconservatives, who argue against transhumanism for practical, moral,\nor aesthetic reasons. There are also posthumanists, who look forward to\na world in which humans are replaced or eliminated by subsequent\nartificial intelligence. The debate over whether such posthumans might\nbe \u2018alive\u2019 is similar in structure to the artificial life\ndiscussion in section 3. Bioconservatives also argue against this view.\nAmong the topics in these debates are whether a particular technology\ncounts as therapy or enhancement, whether the risks of alteration\noutweigh the benefits, whether certain goals of transhumanism are even\npossible, and which alterations will affect the moral or ontological\nstatus of the people that receive them.\nThat life is a source of ethical, legal, and political controversy\nis to be expected. And although it is beyond the scope of this article\nto adjudicate these debates, advocates ought to be aware of the deep\nvagueness in biology and disagreement within philosophy with respect to\nwhat life is, what an individual living organism is, when individual\nlives begin or end, and what features of life ground moral\nconsiderability.\n",
