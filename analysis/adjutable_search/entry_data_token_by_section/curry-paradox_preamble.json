    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cCurry\u2019s paradox\u201d, as the term is used by\n philosophers today, refers to a wide variety of paradoxes of\n self-reference or circularity\n that trace their modern\n ancestry to Curry (1942b) and L\u00f6b\n (1955).[1]\n The common characteristic of these so-called Curry paradoxes is the\nway they exploit a notion of implication, entailment, or consequence,\neither in the form of a connective or in the form of a predicate.\n Curry\u2019s paradox arises in a number of different domains. Like\n Russell\u2019s paradox,\n it can take the form of a paradox of\nset theory or the theory of properties. But it can also take the form\n of a semantic paradox, closely akin to the \n Liar paradox.\n Curry\u2019s paradox differs from both Russell\u2019s paradox and\nthe Liar paradox in that it doesn\u2019t essentially involve the\nnotion of negation. Common truth-theoretic versions involve a sentence\nthat says of itself that if it is true then an arbitrarily chosen\nclaim is true, or\u2014to use a more sinister instance\u2014says of\nitself that if it is true then every falsity is true. The paradox is\nthat the existence of such a sentence appears to imply the truth of\nthe arbitrarily chosen claim, or\u2014in the more sinister\ninstance\u2014of every falsity. In this entry, we show how the\nvarious Curry paradoxes can be constructed, examine the space of\navailable solutions, and explain some ways Curry\u2019s paradox is\nsignificant and poses distinctive challenges.\n",
