Aquinas\u2019 solution is that such an\naddition is possible as the explication of a mode of being that is not\nyet said by \u2018being\u2019 itself: either through a special mode\nof being, i.e. one of the categories, which contract\n\u2018being\u2019 in their own way, or through a general mode of\nbeing, i.e., one of the transcendentals, the addition of which does not\nyield such a contraction. The basic text De ver. 1.1 explains\nthat the expressed mode of being pertains to every being in itself or\nin relation to something else. If it pertains to every being in itself,\nit can either be said positively, i.e. the essence indicated by\n\u2018thing\u2019 (res), or negatively, and that is the\n\u2018indivision\u2019 expressed by \u2018one\u2019. If it pertains\nto every being in relation to something else, it can express either the\ndifference between beings, which is indicated by\n\u2018something\u2019 (aliquid), or their conformity. Since\nthe soul is \u201cin a sense all things\u201d, it is suited to\nconform to every being. A being either conforms to the soul\u2019s\ncognitive faculty, which is expressed by \u2018true\u2019, or to the\nappetitive faculty, which is expressed by \u2018good\u2019. Aquinas\ndeclares \u2018being in general\u2019 (ens commune)\nto be the subject of metaphysics and God to be the principle of this\nsubject (In Metaph., prooem.). Parallel to this\nrestriction of the subject of metaphysics to created being, there is a\nrestriction of the first object of the intellect to the \u2018quiddity\nof material things\u2019 or to \u2018being and the true as found in\nmaterial things\u2019. Reflection on the relation between God and\n\u2018being in general\u2019, which leads Aquinas to present the\ntranscendentals as divine names, and thus to integrate the Platonic and\nAristotelian traditions of reflection on \u2018being\u2019,\n\u2018one\u2019, \u2018true\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019, gives\nrise to the influential doctrine of the analogical predication of the\ntranscendental terms. As stated in the treatise on natural law, the\ntranscendentals \u2018being\u2019 (ens) and\n\u2018good\u2019 serve as the foundation of the principles of\ntheoretical and practical reason (S.th. I-II. 94.2).\n",
