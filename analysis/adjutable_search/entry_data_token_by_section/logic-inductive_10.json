    "main_text": "The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem\n4. The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem\n\nIn this section we will investigate the Likelihood Ratio\nConvergence Theorem. This theorem shows that under certain\nreasonable conditions, when hypothesis \\(h_i\\) (in conjunction with\nauxiliaries in b) is true and an alternative hypothesis \\(h_j\\)\nis empirically distinct from \\(h_i\\) on some possible outcomes of\nexperiments or observations described by conditions \\(c_k\\), then it\nis very likely that a long enough sequence of such\nexperiments and observations c\\(^n\\) will produce a sequence\nof outcomes \\(e^n\\) that yields likelihood ratios \\(P[e^n \\pmid\nh_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}] / P[e^n \\pmid h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}]\\) that\napproach 0, favoring \\(h_i\\) over \\(h_j\\), as evidence accumulates\n(i.e., as n increases). This theorem places an explicit lower\nbound on the \u201crate of probable convergence\u201d of these\nlikelihood ratios towards 0. That is, it puts a lower bound on how\nlikely it is, if \\(h_i\\) is true, that a stream of outcomes will occur\nthat yields likelihood ratio values against \\(h_j\\) as compared to\n\\(h_i\\) that lie within any specified small distance above 0. \n\nThe theorem itself does not require the full apparatus of Bayesian\nprobability functions. It draws only on likelihoods. Neither the\nstatement of the theorem nor its proof employ prior probabilities of\nany kind. So even likelihoodists, who eschew the use of\nBayesian prior probabilities, may embrace this result. Given the forms\nof Bayes\u2019 Theorem, 9*-11 from the previous section, the\nLikelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem further implies the\nlikely convergence to 0 of the posterior probabilities of false\ncompetitors of a true hypothesis. That is, when the ratios \\(P[e^n\n\\pmid h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{n}] / P[e^n \\pmid h_{i}\\cdot b\\cdot\nc^{n}]\\) approach 0 for increasing n, the Ratio Form of\nBayes\u2019 Theorem,\n Equation 9*,\n says that the posterior probability of \\(h_j\\) must also approach 0\nas evidence accumulates, regardless of the value of its prior\nprobability. So, support functions in collections representing vague\nprior plausibilities for an individual agent (i.e., a\nvagueness set) and representing the diverse range of priors\nfor a community of agents (i.e., a diversity set) will come\nto agree on the near 0 posterior probability of empirically distinct\nfalse rivals of a true hypothesis. And as the posterior probabilities\nof false competitors fall, the posterior probability of the true\nhypothesis heads towards 1. Thus, the theorem establishes that the\ninductive logic of probabilistic support functions satisfies the\n Criterion of Adequacy (CoA)\n suggested at the beginning of this article.\n\nThe Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem merely provides some\nsufficient conditions for probable convergence. But likelihood ratios\nmay well converge towards 0 (in the way described by the theorem) even\nwhen the antecedent conditions of the theorem are not satisfied. This\ntheorem overcomes many of the objections raised by critics of Bayesian\nconvergence results. First, this theorem does not employ\nsecond-order probabilities; it says noting about the\nprobability of a probability. It only concerns the probability of a\nparticular disjunctive sentence that expresses a disjunction of\nvarious possible sequences of experimental or observational outcomes.\nThe theorem does not require evidence to consist of sequences of\nevents that, according to the hypothesis, are identically distributed\n(like repeated tosses of a die). The result is most easily expressed\nin cases where the individual outcomes of a sequence of experiments or\nobservations are probabilistically independent, given each hypothesis.\nSo that is the version that will be presented in this section.\nHowever, a version of the theorem also holds when the individual\noutcomes of the evidence stream are not probabilistically independent,\ngiven the hypotheses. (This more general version of the theorem will\nbe presented in a supplement on the\n Probabilistic Refutation Theorem,\n below, where the proof of both versions is provided.) In addition,\nthis result does not rely on supposing that the probability functions\ninvolved are countably additive. Furthermore, the explicit\nlower bounds on the rate of convergence provided by this result means\nthat there is no need to wait for the infinitely long run before\nconvergence occurs (as some critics seem to think).\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that Bayesian convergence results only work\nwhen an agent locks in values for the prior probabilities of\nhypotheses once-and-for-all, and then updates posterior probabilities\nfrom there only by conditioning on evidence via Bayes Theorem. The\nLikelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem, however, applies even\nif agents revise their prior probability assessments over time. Such\nnon-Bayesian shifts from one support function (or vagueness\nset) to another may arise from new plausibility arguments or from\nreassessments of the strengths of old ones. The Likelihood Ratio\nConvergence Theorem itself only involves the values of\nlikelihoods. So, provided such reassessments don\u2019t push the\nprior probability of the true hypothesis towards 0 too\nrapidly, the theorem implies that the posterior probabilities of\neach empirically distinct false competitor will very probably\napproach 0 as evidence\n increases.[13]\n\n",
