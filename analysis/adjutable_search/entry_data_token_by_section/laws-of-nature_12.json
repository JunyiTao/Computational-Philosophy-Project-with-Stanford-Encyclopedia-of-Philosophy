    "main_text": "Physics and the Special Sciences || Could there be any Special-Science Laws?\n11. Concluding Remarks: What is Next?\n\nHow will matters progress? How can philosophy advance beyond the\ncurrent disputes about laws of nature? Three issues are\nespecially interesting and important ones. The first concerns\nwhether lawhood is a part of the content of scientific theories. This\nis a question often asked about causation, but less frequently\naddressed about lawhood. Roberts offers an analogy in support of the\nthought that it is not: It is a postulate of Euclidean geometry that\ntwo points determine a line. But it is not part of the content of\nEuclidean geometry that this proposition is a postulate. Euclidean\ngeometry is not a theory about postulates; it is a theory about\npoints, lines, and planes \u2026 (2008, 92). This may be a\nplausible first step toward understanding the absence  of some\nnomic terms from formal statements of scientific theories. The\nsecond issue is whether there are any contingent laws of nature.\nNecessitarians continue to work on filling in their view, while\nHumeans and others pay relatively little attention to what they are up\nto; new work needs to explain the source of the underlying commitments\nthat divide these camps.  Finally, more attention needs to be\npaid to the language used to report what are the laws and the language\nused to express the laws themselves and whether the laws\nexplain. It is clear that recent disputes about generalizations\nin physics and the special sciences turn on precisely these matters,\nbut exploring them may also pay dividends on central matters regarding\nontology, realism vs. antirealism, and supervenience.\n",
