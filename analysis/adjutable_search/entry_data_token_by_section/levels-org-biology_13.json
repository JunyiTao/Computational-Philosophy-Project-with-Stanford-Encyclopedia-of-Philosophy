    "main_text": "Levels in biological theory and usage || Levels and experimental biological research\n6.5 Levels and experimental biological research\n\nAlthough the levels concept may at first glance appear an abstract\nidea poised orthogonally to empirical matters (or interpretations\nthereof), the constituents of nature that the concept orders also\ncomprise targets of experimental investigation. In this way, the\nlevels concept can be conceptualized not only as local maxima of\nregularity and predictability, but also as local maxima of\nobservability and manipulability. Here we describe several\nexperimental practices where levels play an important role, focusing\non observation and manipulation.\n\nTracking the various objects and processes occurring at different\nscales of nature is a centerpiece to conducting observations and\nobservational studies in biology. That these constituents then also\nfrequently make up central units of study for biology (molecules,\ncells, tissues, organs, and so on) is one notable element of the\nlevels concept\u2019s basic expression (Wimsatt 1994; 2021). The\nsystematicity of these constituents\u2019 relationships is an\nespecially noteworthy consequence of reasoning with the levels\nconcept: When we shift between scale resolutions (be it temporal or\nspatial), different units of study can be identified and investigated.\nOftentimes, the units generically involved in an area of research\n(molecules, cells, tissues) are basically known, but their specific\ndynamics comprise targets for further study and characterization\n(Brooks 2021b).\n\nIn addition to observational techniques, experimental manipulation of\ndifferent scale-bound units is another hallmark of daily practices in\nbiological research. Here the levels concept contributes to our basic\nreasoning of these practices by aiding our efforts in testing\nhypotheses and building explanations. In this vein, Alan Love (2021)\nargues that applying the levels concept is not merely a matter of\nabstract representation, but also of articulating well-defined\nexperimental targets in laboratory settings. Love considers examples\nsuch as mixed cell aggregates, a well-established and classical\nexperimental technique where tissues are first physically separated\ninto their constituent cells, mixed together in a medium, and then\nsegregate and regrow into tissue aggregates of similar cell-type (see\nespecially Moscona 1959). Such targets of manipulation, Love reasons,\nalign with the explicit aims of researching biologists to describe,\npredict, and explain biological phenomena such as morphogenesis (and\nbiological development in general; see Love 2021: 139).\n\nAs the example of mixed cell aggregates implies, observation and\nmanipulation co-occur in experimental settings: Tissues (higher level)\nare physically separated into individual cells (lower level) and\nplaced in a medium (that is, are manipulated), and their subsequent\nbehavior is observed and measured. Such transitions to and from higher\nand lower levels demonstrate the structuring capacities of the levels\nconcept for interpreting the significance of experimental efforts.\nConsider another example from experimental evolution (for a primer\nsee, e.g., Kawecki et al. 2012), where the transition from cellular to\nmulticellular individuals is experimentally induced in different\nspecies of unicellular life. In one experiment, Ratcliff, Denison, et\nal. (2012) induced multicellular snowflake-like clusters in the yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae using a simple selection regime\n(i.e., gravity; multicellular clusters sink more quickly in a medium,\nand were collected after various intervals and placed in a new\nmedium). These clusters began reproducing via post-division adhesion\n(rather than aggregation) across several generations, thus creating\nits own novel life history (reproducing uniclonal clusters rather than\naggregates containing individual cell genomes), developing a division\nof labor among cell constituents (see also Simpson 2012), and even\nexhibiting regulation of cluster phenotype behavior, seen in the\nemergence of programmed cell death in individual cells unable to\ncontribute to the supracellular individual (see also Ratcliff,\nFankhauser, et al. 2015; Herron et al. 2019).\n\nFocusing on the practical and experimental significance of levels of\norganization also stands to contribute to the philosophical discourse\non levels more generally. Love (2021), for instance, argues that the\npractices of working biologists in manipulating levels warrant an\ninference from successful practice to scientific metaphysics, thereby\nsupporting a \u201cmodest realism\u201d regarding levels of\norganization.\n",
