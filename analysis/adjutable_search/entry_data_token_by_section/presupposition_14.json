Presuppositions and attitudes\n\nFor nearly four decades, the Holy Grail of presupposition research has\nbeen to explain the behavior of presuppositional expressions occurring\nin embedded positions. A particularly challenging mode of embedding\narises with attitude verbs. If we embed a presupposition trigger\nunder, e.g., \u201cbelieve\u201d, we observe two types of inference.\nThis is seen in the following examples, where \u201c\u2192\u201d\nindicates that there is an inference, but of unspecified type:\n\n(50)\nBarney believes that his sister is drunk.\n\n\u2192 Barney has a sister.\n\n\u2192 Barney believes he has a sister.\n(51)\nWilma believes that Barney knows that his sister is\ndrunk.\n\n\u2192 Barney\u2019s sister is drunk.\n\n\u2192 Wilma believes that Barney\u2019s sister is drunk.\n\n\nBoth inferences are fairly robust, and both seem to exhibit projection\nbehavior, as we illustrate here by applying various embedding tests to\n(50):\n\n(52a)\nBarney doesn\u2019t believe that his sister is drunk.\n(52b)\nPerhaps Barney believes that his sister is drunk.\n\n\n(52c)\nIf Barney has a sister, then he believes that his sister is\ndrunk.\n(52d)\nIf Barney believes that he has a sister, then he also believes\nthat his sister is drunk.\n\n\nIt is natural to infer from both (52a) and (52b) that Barney has a\nsister and that he believes that he has a sister, and these inferences\ncan be blocked in sentences such as those in (52c) and (52d) , where\n\u201chis sister\u201d occurs in the consequent of a conditional\nwhose antecedent makes one or the other inference explicit. It may\nseem odd at first that (52c) should block the inference that Barney\nbelieves that he has a sister, while (52d) blocks the inference that\nBarney has a sister. Note however that, generally speaking, Barney has\na sister iff he believes that he has a sister. We\u2019ll return\nto this theme below.\n\nInterestingly, literally the same pattern of observations holds for\nother attitude verbs, like \u201cwant\u201d for example:\n\n(53)\nBarney wants to phone his sister.\n\n\u2192 Barney has a sister.\n\n\u2192 Barney believes he has a sister.\n\n\nThe puzzling thing is that (53) does not license the inference that\nBarney wants to have a sister, but rather that he believes\nthat he has one.\n\nSo, in many cases at least, a presupposition \u03c6 triggered within\nthe scope of \u201cx\nVA\u2026\u201d, where\nVA is an attitude verb, gives rise to two\ninferences with a candidature for presuppositional status: (a) that\n\u03c6 and (b) that x believes \u03c6. Hence, we have three\npossible ways of proceeding, all of which have been defended in the\nliterature:\n\nBoth inferences are presuppositions (Zeevat 1992, at least for\ncertain triggers).\nOnly \u03c6 is a presupposition (Gazdar 1979a; van der Sandt 1988;\nGeurts 1998).\nOnly \u201cx believes that \u03c6\u201d is a\npresupposition (Karttunen 1974; Heim 1992).\n\n\nThe first strategy seems to require a stipulation that certain\npresuppositions have to be accommodated twice, once inside a belief\ncontext, and once outside, and such a strategy is difficult to\nmotivate. On the other hand, for (ii) and (iii),\nthere is the obvious problem that if we adopt either one of them, we\nonly account for half of the observed inferences. How to explain the\nother half? Three possible answers to this question have been\ndiscussed in the literature, mainly by Heim (1992):\n\nDe re construal (Heim 1992) What at first looks like a\npresupposition projecting to the global context may in fact be due to\na de re construal of the presupposition trigger. This\nsolution has several serious drawbacks. In particular, it\u2019s hard to\nsee how this proposal can give us both inferences at the same time,\nrather than one (de re) or the other (presupposition). For\nthis and other reasons (see Geurts 1998), we will not consider it any\nfurther.\nExportation (Karttunen 1974, Heim 1992, Kay 1992) If\nBarney believes that he has a sister, then it may plausibly be\ninferred that he has a sister. Therefore, if it is presupposed that\nBarney believes that he has a sister, then it may plausibly be\ninferred that he has a sister.\nImportation (Heim 1992, Geurts 1998) If Barney has a\nsister, then it may plausibly be inferred that he believes that he has\na sister. Therefore, if it is presupposed that Barney has a sister,\nthen it may plausibly be inferred that he believes that he has a\nsister.\n\n\nIf our presupposition theory predicts that the inferences projected\nfrom \u201cx VA\u201d are of\nthe form \u201cx believes that \u03c6\u201d, then we can\nappeal to exportation to explain why \u03c6 is inferable, as well.\nVice versa, a theory which predicts that \u03c6 is presupposed\ncan use importation for deriving \u201cx believes that\n\u03c6\u201d. So we have two options:\n\n\n\u00a0\nx believes that \u03c6\n\u03c6 \n\nOption A\nimportation\npresupposition \n\nOption B\npresupposition\nexportation \n\n\nWhich is it going to be? That\u2019s a hard question, which raises various\nissues, only some of which we can mention here. First, it should be\nnoted that, whereas for theories of the satisfaction family it is hard\nto avoid making the prediction that presuppositions projected\nfrom attitude contexts are of the form \u201cx believes that\n\u03c6\u201d, DRT-style theories are more flexible, and can predict\neither this or that the presupposition is simply \u03c6. In other\nwords, satisfaction theories are more constrained (which is good), but\ntherefore practically forced to resort to Option B.\n\nOne of the issues that need to be addressed is that of the true nature\nof importation and exportation inferences. It seems reasonable to\nassume that, generally speaking, people\u2019s beliefs are consistent with\nthe facts, and that we tend to assume by default that this is the\ncase. But even if this much is true, it is most unlikely that, by\ndefault, people will infer \u03c6 from \u201cx believes\n\u03c6\u201d (for arbitrary x and \u03c6), or vice versa.\nWhatever importation and exportation are, they aren\u2019t general\nheuristics; rather, these inferences are almost certainly dependent on\nthe context to some degree.\n",
