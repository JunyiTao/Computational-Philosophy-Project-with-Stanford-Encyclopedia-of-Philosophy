One of the most important points is to decide\nwhether one of the concepts to be studied is \u2018more\nfundamental\u2019 than the other, in the sense that the latter can be\ndefined in terms of the former. As mentioned, the famous understanding\nof knowledge as justified true belief is one of the most notable\nexamples. Others are equally relevant, as a definition of beliefs in\nterms of the available arguments/evidence/justifications, or a\ndefinition of epistemic notions for a group in terms of the epistemic\nnotions of its members. Yet, the basic alethic modal logic of\nnecessity and possibility already provides a paradigmatic example of\nhow to define the relationship between two concepts.\n",
