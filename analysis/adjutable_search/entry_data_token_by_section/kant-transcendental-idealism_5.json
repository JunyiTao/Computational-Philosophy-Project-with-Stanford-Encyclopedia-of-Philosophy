    "main_text": "The Feder-Garve Review and Kant\u2019s Replies || Varieties of Phenomenalism\n2.2 Varieties of Phenomenalism\n\nPhenomenalism can mean many things, and later we will explore these\nmeanings in detail, but for now it is worth distinguishing at least\nthree different things we might mean by phenomenalism:\n\n(1) \n Objects in space are identical to (unified collections of) our\n representations.[10]\n(2) \n Objects in space exist solely in virtue of the contents of our\nrepresentations of them. They possess all of their properties solely\nin virtue of the contents of those representations.\n(3)\n Objects in space exist partly in virtue of the contents of our\nrepresentations of them. They possess their \u201ccore physical\nproperties\u201d solely in virtue of the contents of those\nrepresentations.\n\n\n\u201cCore physical properties\u201d here means the properties that\nappearances have \u201cin themselves\u201d according to Kant. These\nare, roughly, Lockean primary qualities (see Locke, Essay\nconcerning Human Understanding, book II, chapter VIII).\nFeder-Garve accuse Kant of holding (1), which we may call\n\u201cidentity phenomenalism\u201d. But even if he did not hold that\nextreme view, he might hold one of the weaker views listed here. Claim\n(2) is a quite strong form of phenomenalism, for it entails that, in\nsome sense, all there is to objects is our representations of them,\nalthough they are not literally identical to those representation. We\nmay call this \u201cstrong phenomenalism\u201d. The exact meaning of\nBerkeley\u2019s own views about bodies is unclear, and not the\nsubject of this entry. But it is not implausible to read Berkeley as\nholding (2). However, claim (3), while very controversial and\n(arguably) extremely counter-intuitive, is weaker. It allows that\nthere may be more to the existence of objects in space than our\nrepresenting them, and it allows that there may be aspects or\nproperties of objects that they possess independently of how we\nrepresent them. We may call it \u201cqualified phenomenalism\u201d.\nIn discussing the debate about Kant\u2019s alleged phenomenalism, and\nKant\u2019s own responses to the Feder-Garve review, it will help to\nhave these distinctions in mind.\n",
