    "main_text": "History || Knowledge, Impersonality, and Control\n3.3 Knowledge, Impersonality, and Control\n\nOn a more analytical plateau, all these disparate processes of\nrationalization can be surmised as increasing knowledge, growing\nimpersonality, and enhanced control [Brubaker 1991, 32\u201335].\nFirst, knowledge. Rational action in one very general sense\npresupposes knowledge. It requires some knowledge of the ideational\nand material circumstances in which our action is embedded, since to\nact rationally is to act on the basis of conscious reflection about\nthe probable consequences of action. As such, the knowledge that\nunderpins a rational action is of a causal nature conceived in terms\nof means-ends relationships, aspiring towards a systematic, logically\ninterconnected whole. Modern scientific and technological knowledge is\na culmination of this process that Weber called intellectualization,\nin the course of which, the germinating grounds of human knowledge in\nthe past, such as religion, theology, and metaphysics, were slowly\npushed back to the realm of the superstitious, mystical, or simply\nirrational. It is only in modern Western civilization, according to\nWeber, that this gradual process of disenchantment\n(Entzauberung) has reached its radical conclusion.\n\nSecond, impersonality. Rationalization, according to Weber, entails\nobjectification (Versachlichung). Industrial capitalism, for\none, reduces workers to sheer numbers in an accounting book,\ncompletely free from the fetters of tradition and non-economic\nconsiderations, and so does the market relationship vis-\u00e0-vis\nbuyers and sellers. For another, having abandoned the principle of\nKhadi justice (i.e., personalized ad hoc adjudication),\nmodern law and administration also rule in strict accordance with the\nsystematic formal codes and sine ira et studio, that is,\n\u201cwithout anger or passion.\u201d Again, Weber found the seed of\nobjectification not in material interests alone, but in the Puritan\nvocational ethic (Berufsethik) and the life conduct that it\ninspired, which was predicated upon a disenchanted monotheistic\ntheodicy that reduced humans to mere tools of God\u2019s providence.\nIronically, for Weber, modern inward subjectivity was born once we\nlost any inherent value qua humans and became thoroughly\nobjectified vis-\u00e0-vis God in the course of the Reformation.\nModern individuals are subjectified and objectified all at once.\n\nThird, control. Pervasive in Weber\u2019s view of rationalization is\nthe increasing control in social and material life. Scientific and\ntechnical rationalization has greatly improved both the human capacity\nfor a mastery over nature and institutionalized discipline\nvia bureaucratic administration, legal formalism, and\nindustrial capitalism. The calculable, disciplined control over humans\nwas, again, an unintended consequence of the Puritan ethic of rigorous\nself-discipline and self-control, or what Weber called\n\u201cinnerworldly asceticism (innerweltliche\nAskese).\u201d Here again, Weber saw the irony that a modern\nindividual citizen equipped with inviolable rights was born as a part\nof the rational, disciplinary ethos that increasingly penetrated into\nevery aspect of social life.\n",
