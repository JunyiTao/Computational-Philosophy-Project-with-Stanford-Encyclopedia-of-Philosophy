They are: (1) positions whose historical beginnings\nare located in non-feminist Western environmental philosophies; (2)\npositions that were initially identified with\n\u201cecofeminism\u201d (or \u201cecological feminism\u201d)\ngenerally, but, since the late 1980s and early 1990s, are more\naccurately identified with\n\u201cecofeminist philosophy,\u201d specifically; and (3)\nnew or emerging \u201cstand alone\u201d\npositions that offer novel or unique perspectives on\n\u201cwomen-nature connections\u201d that are not identified with\neither (1) or (2). Discussion of these three sorts of positions\nconstitutes the subject matter of Section 2.\n",
