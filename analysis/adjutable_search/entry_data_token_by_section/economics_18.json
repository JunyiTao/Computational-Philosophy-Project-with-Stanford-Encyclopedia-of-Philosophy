    "main_text": "Influential approaches to economic methodology || Economic methodology and social studies of science\n4.4 Economic methodology and social studies of science\n\nThroughout its history, economics has been the subject of sociological\nas well as methodological scrutiny. Many sociological discussions of\neconomics, like Marx\u2019s critique of classical political economy,\nhave been concerned to identify ideological distortions and thereby to\ncriticize particular aspects of economic theory and economic policy.\nSince every political program finds economists who testify to its\neconomic virtues, there is a never-ending source of material for such\ncritiques. For example, in the wake of the near collapse of the\ninternational financial system in 2008, American economists who argued\nfor austerity were mostly Republicans, while those who defended\nefforts to increase aggregate demand were mostly Democrats.\n\nThe influence of contemporary sociology of science and social studies\nof science, coupled with the difficulties methodologists have had\nmaking sense of and rationalizing the conduct of economics, have led\nto efforts at fusing economics and sociology (Granovetter 1985,\nSwedberg 1990, 2007) as well as to a sociological turn within\nmethodological reflection itself. Rather than showing that there is\ngood evidence supporting developments in economic theory or that those\ndevelopments have other broadly epistemic virtues, methodologists and\nhistorians such as D. Wade Hands (2001); Hands and Mirowski 1998),\nPhilip Mirowski (1990, 2002, 2004, 2013), and E. Roy Weintraub (1991)\nhave argued that these changes reflect a wide variety of non-rational\nfactors, from changes in funding for theoretical economics, political\ncommitments, personal rivalries, attachments to metaphors, or\nmathematical interests.\n\nFurthermore, many of the same methodologists and historians have\nargued that economics is not only an object of social inquiry, but\nthat it can be a tool of social inquiry into science. By studying the\nincentive structure of scientific disciplines and the implicit or\nexplicit market forces impinging on research (including of course\nresearch in economics), it should be possible to write the economics\nof science and the economics of economics itself (Hands 1995, Hull\n1988, Leonard 2002, Mirowski and Sent 2002).\n\nExactly how, if at all, this work is supposed to bear on questions\nconcerning how well supported are the claims economists make is not\nclear. Though eschewing traditional methodology, Mirowski\u2019s\nmonograph on the role of physical analogy in economics (1990) is often\nvery critical of mainstream economics. In his Reflection without\nRules (2001) D. W. Hands maintains that general methodological\nrules are of little use. He defends a naturalistic view of methodology\nand is skeptical of prescriptions that are not based on detailed\nknowledge. But he does not argue that no rules apply.\n",
