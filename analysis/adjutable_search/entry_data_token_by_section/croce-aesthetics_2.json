    "main_text": "Art and Aesthetics\n3. Art and Aesthetics\n\nWith such an account of \u2018the aesthetic\u2019 in view, one might\nthink that Croce intends to cover roughly the same ground as\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic, and like Kant will think of art\nas a comparatively narrow if profound region of experience. But Croce\ntakes the opposite line (and finds Kant\u2019s theory of beauty and\nart to have failed at precisely this point): art is everywhere, and\nthe difference between ordinary intuition and that of \u2018works of\nart\u2019 is only a quantitative difference\n(Aes.13). This principle has for Croce a profound\nsignificance:\n\nWe must hold firmly to our identification, because among the principal\nreasons which have prevented Aesthetic, the science of art, from\nrevealing the true nature of art, its real roots in human nature, has\nbeen its separation from the general spiritual life, the having made\nof it a sort of special function or aristocratic club\u2026. There\nis not \u2026 a special chemical theory of stones as distinct from\nmountains. In the same way, there is not a science of lesser intuition\nas distinct from a science of greater intuition, nor one of ordinary\nintuition as distinct from artistic intuition. (Aes. 14)\n\n\nBut the point is not that every object is to some degree a work of\nart. The point is that every intuition has to some degree the\nqualities of the intuition of a work of art; it\u2019s just that the\nintuition of a work of art has them in much greater degree.\n",
