    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness || Amniotes (including birds and reptiles)\n6.4 Amniotes (including birds and reptiles)\n\nQuestions about whether reptiles are conscious (and if so what their\nmental lives might be like) are especially interesting because birds\nare more closely related to them than they are to mammals, yet birds\ndisplay a variety of behaviors that tend to intuitively suggest\nintelligence and emotion to human observers much more obviously than\nthe behavior of scaly, so-called \u2018cold-blooded\u2019 animals\nlike snakes and turtles. Do birds and mammals share mental features\n(consciousness, intelligence, emotion, social attachment) that are\nabsent in reptiles? If so this would represent independent, convergent\nevolution of these phenomena. Alternatively, are these features common\nto all of these animals, but less obvious in some than others?\n Cabanac et al. (2009) argue that consciousness is unique to, and\nshared by all amniotes \u2014 the clade that includes all\ndescendants of the common ancestor of living birds and mammals,\nincluding reptiles such as lizards, snakes, turtles and extinct\nanimals such as dinosaurs, pterosaurs and pleseiosaurs (see\nhttp://tolweb.org/Amniota). On this hypothesis, only these animals,\nand not amphibians, fish, or any invertebrates, possess\nconsciousness. Cabanac\u2019s argument is based on an explicit structural\nand functional theory of consciousness as a unified representational\nspace, \u201can abstract private model of reality with four dimensions:\nquality, intensity, hedonicity and duration\u201d (2009, p.268). Possessing\nthis ability to model reality allows animals to simulate possible\ncourses of action, using hedonicity (pleasure or pain) as a\n\u2018common currency\u2019 to evaluate and choose between actions\nbased on expected consequences (which are based on prior\nexperience). \n\nCabanac identifies a set of behavioral markers of consciousness, based\non this model structural and functional theory:\n\nthe ability to make motivational tradeoffs;\nplay; \nnavigational detouring (which requires an animal to pursue a\nseries of nonrewarding intermediate goals in order to obtain an\nultimate reward);\nexpression of emotion; \nexpression of sensory pleasure;\nemotional fever (an increase in body temperature in response to a\nsupposedly stressful situation \u2014 gentle handling, as\noperationalized in Cabanac\u2019s experiments);\ntaste aversion.\n\n Based on supposed evidence of these phenomena in amniotes but not\nin non-amniotes, Cabanac argues that consciousness originated in the\ncommon ancestor of amniotes, and hence is present in all living\namniotes but in no other animals. Cabanac and Cabanac (2009) also\nargue that a qualitative difference in the role of dopamine in\nmotivational processes in the brains of amniotes compared to\nnon-amniotes supports this distribution/origin hypothesis. \n Cabanac and colleagues have documented the presence of some of\nthese phenomena in amniotes, in contrast with their absence in at\nleast a small number of non-amniote species, such as emotional fever\n(Cabanac and Bernieri 2000; Cabanac and Cabanac 2000; Cabanac and\nCabanac 2004) and taste aversion (Paradis and Cabanac 2004). \n However, the assertion that these aspects of behavior and\ncognition do not exist outside amniota is largely based on absence of\nevidence (and hence, inherently limited). In particular, they do not\noffer direct support for their claims that non-amniotes are incapable\nof trading off punishments and rewards, play or detouring. Indeed,\nsome of these claims appear to be contradicted by existing studies\n\u2014 for example, documentation of detouring in jumping spiders\n(Jackson and Wilcox 2003) and work by Elwood and Appel(2009) that\nshows motivational trade-off behavior in hermit crabs. \n Cabanac\u2019s structural and functional theory of consciousness can be\nevaluated independently of the evidence that he marshals in support of\nhis view of the distribution and origins of consciousness. Indeed, one\nmight challenge his views on distribution and origins precisely by\naccepting his structural and functional theory, and arguing that the\nlist of proposed indicators can actually by identified with a wider\ndistribution (i.e. if motivational trade-offs, play, and detouring are\npresent outside of amniotes). As we shall see, his structural and\nfunctional views of consciousness have much in common with those of\nother authors who argue for wider distributions of consciousness among\nanimals.\n",
