    "preamble": "\n\nPacifism is a commitment to peace and opposition to war. Our ordinary\nlanguage allows a diverse set of beliefs and commitments to be held\ntogether under the general rubric of pacifism. This article will\nexplain the family resemblance among the variety of pacifisms. It will\nlocate pacifism within deontological and consequentialist approaches\nto ethics. It will consider diverse cultural and religious sources of\npacifism. And it will consider and reply to objections to\npacifism.\n\nThe word \u201cpacifism\u201d is derived from the word\n\u201cpacific,\u201d which means \u201cpeace making\u201d [Latin,\npaci- (from pax) meaning \u201cpeace\u201d and\n-ficus meaning \u201cmaking\u201d]. Modern usage has been\ntraced to 1901 and \u00c9mile Artaud\u2019s usage of the French\nterm pacifisme. But the basic commitment to peace is an old\nidea. Pacifist sentiment can be found, for example, in the West in\nearly Christianity. Perhaps the most famous use of the word pacifism\nis found in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), where Jesus\nclaims that the \u201cpeacemakers\u201d are blessed. In this\npassage, the Greek word eirenopoios is translated into Latin\nas pacifici, which means those who work for peace. The Greek\neirenopoios is derived from the Greek\neir\u00ean\u00ea [peace] in conjunction with\npoiesis [to make].\n\nPhilosophical discussions of pacifism have clarified the concept by\ndistinguishing the more general commitment to nonviolence from a\nnarrower anti-war position. A related term,\n\u201cnonviolentism,\u201d has been coined by Holmes (Holmes 2013:\n157), to describe a position that goes beyond anti-war pacifism in its\nopposition to violence in all of its forms. Pacifism has often been\ndefined dialectically in relation to the idea of justified violence\nthat is found in the Western just war\n tradition.[1]\n Pacifism is often located on a continuum for assessing the morality\nof war that includes realism, just war theory, and pacifism. The\nfundamental question here is \u201ccan war be justified?\u201d (see\nFiala and Kling, 2023). Indeed, there is an ongoing debate about the\nproper relation between just war theory and pacifism that focuses on\nthe question of whether the just war theory begins with a pacifist\npresumption against war. Some authors have used the just war theory to\nderive a version of pacifism described as \u201ccontingent\npacifism\u201d (May 2015, for example) or \u201cjust war\npacifism\u201d (Sterba 1998). Authors such as Cheyney Ryan and Robert\nHolmes more strongly maintain that the just war framework is flawed.\nHolmes argues that the just war tradition typically ignores the\ncentral moral issue in war, which is about the presumptive immorality\nof the \u201cmassive, systematic and deliberate killing of human\nbeings\u201d that occurs in war (Holmes 2017a: xvii). Ryan argues\nthat although the just war tradition and pacifism developed through\n\u201cmutual critique\u201d pacifism has often been marginalized as\nan \u201coutcast tradition\u201d (Ryan 2017: 125). And yet, the\n\u201cpacifist tradition\u201d includes a robust historical dialogue\ninvolving important authors and movements (Fiala 2018b; Fiala and\nKling 2023).\n\nSome have tried to distinguish \u201cpacific-ism\u201d from\npacifism, where pacific-ism is a commitment to peace and peacefulness\nthat is not strictly opposed to war while pacifism is a more\nprincipled or absolute rejection of violence. But this distinction is\nnot widely accepted (although Dower 2009 employed it). William James\nused the term \u201cpacific-ism\u201d in 1910 to describe his\nrejection of militarism (James 1910). The shorter term,\n\u201cpacifism,\u201d has become more common in English usage to\ndescribe a variety of views that are critical of war.\n\nGenerally pacifism is thought to be a principled rejection of war and\nkilling. Oddly enough, terminology related to pacifism has\noccasionally been used to describe a pragmatic commitment to using war\nto create peace. Thus a term like \u201cpacification\u201d can be\nemployed in military usage to describe a violent process of\nsuppressing violence, as when an enemy territory is\n\u201cpacified\u201d by killing or disabling the enemy. While George\nOrwell (2002) complained about such euphemistic descriptions of\nviolence, the just war tradition does hold that war can be a suitable\nmeans to bring about peace. Despite these complications, pacifism\ngenerally connotes a commitment to making peace that rejects violent\nmeans for obtaining this end. One reason to reject violent means is\nthe fact that might does not make right. While violence can destroy an\nenemy, victory does not amount to justification.\n\nPacifism, as it is understood in ordinary discourse today, includes a\nvariety of commitments on a continuum from an absolute adherence to\nnonviolence in all actions to a more focused or minimal sort of\nanti-warism. In contrast to the just war tradition, pacifism rejects\nwar as an acceptable means for obtaining peace. Pacifists will often\nrefuse to serve in the military. And some refuse to support political\nand social systems that promote war by, for example, withholding their\ntaxes. Pacifists have been associated with quietistic withdrawal from\npolitical life and even outright anarchism. But pacifists need not be\n\u201cpassive\u201d: many committed pacifists have been actively\ninvolved in nonviolent social protest. Pacifism can be used to\ndescribe a commitment to nonviolence in one\u2019s personal life that\nmight include the attempt to cultivate pacific virtues such as\ntolerance, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and love. It might also be\nextended to include nonviolence toward all sentient beings and thus\nresult in a commitment to vegetarianism and what Albert Schweitzer\n(1967) called, \u201creverence for life.\u201d Pacifism can be\nconnected to a larger project of spiritual transformation, as in\nGandhi\u2019s commitment to ahimsa or nonviolence. And as the author\nof the present entry has argued, pacifism can be understood as\noffering a comprehensive normative framework (Fiala 2018a).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Defining Peace\n\nPacifism is the broad commitment to making peace. The idea is\ncomplicated by the fact that peace is a family resemblance term: there\nare many varieties of peace. Peace is easiest to define dialectically\nas the opposite of war or violence. Pacifism has thus been described\nsimply as anti-warism or as commitment to nonviolence. One conceptual\ndifficulty here is that when peace is defined negatively, pacifism\nappears as a reactionary response to war and violence. Discussions of\npeace thus often employ negative terms and creative neologisms to\nexpress the concept of peace: \u201cnonviolence,\u201d\n\u201cnonwar,\u201d \u201cnonkilling,\u201d\n\u201cnonconflict,\u201d or \u201cnonwar.\u201d Peace advocates\nwill however insist that peace should be understood as a primary\nconcept connected to cooperation, harmony, and positive human\nrelations and that it is a mistake to understand peace in merely\nnegative terms (see Fox 2014). At any rate, peace scholarship has long\nemphasized the distinction between negative peace and\npositive peace: negative peace is the absence of violence or\nwar while positive peace encompasses cooperative, tranquil, and\nharmonious relations and the broader concerns of human flourishing and\nintegration (see Galtung 1969; Boersema 2017). A related distinction\nis that between what Sims et al (2014) call \u201cpersonal\npeacefulness,\u201d involving small groups of people, and peace at a\nlarger international scale, up to and including \u201cworld peace\u201d (see\nBellamy 2019).\n\nWhen pacifism is defined as anti-warism, we encounter the difficulty\nof defining war. War is usually thought of as violence between states\nor, more broadly speaking, political communities. But the term\n\u201cwar\u201d can also be applied to violent conflicts among\nindividuals, as in Hobbes\u2019 idea that the state of nature is a\nstate of war. Similarly, although peace is usually thought of as a\npolitical condition of amicable relations between states, terms like\n\u201cpeace\u201d or \u201cpeaceful\u201d can also be used to\ndescribe a relation between individuals or even a person\u2019s state\nof mind.\n\nIf pacifism is defined as a commitment to nonviolence, we encounter\nthe same problem of definition. Violence usually has a normative value\nand is defined as something like \u201can unjustified injury or\nharm.\u201d But it is possible to speak of justified\nviolence\u2014as in the just war theory. And so, the normative value\nof violence remains an open question. The concept of violence can also\nbe extended metaphorically and used as an\nadjective\u2014\u201cviolent\u201d\u2014to mean something like\nunbridled, uncontrolled, rough, or intense. Thus we speak of\n\u201cviolent storms\u201d or \u201cviolent emotions.\u201d A\ncommitment to nonviolence is, at least, a commitment to avoiding\nunjustified intentional injury. Pacifists will tend to think that most\nintentionally caused harms are unjustifiable. But the ideal of\nnonviolence might be extended to include the idea of controlling rough\nand intense emotions. In his essay, \u201cJourney to\nNonviolence,\u201d for example, Martin Luther King Jr. claimed that a\ncommitment to nonviolence required overcoming the \u201cinternal\nviolence\u201d of hatred and anger by cultivating love and compassion\n(King 1986, 46).\n\nThere are a variety of possibilities for thinking about the nature of\npeace and thus for understanding what pacifism aims at creating.\n1.1 Peace as Slavery or Submission\n\nPeace can result from submission to power; and war can end with\nunconditional surrender. Rousseau maligned this sort of peace by\ncalling it the \u201cpeace of Ulysses and his comrades, imprisoned in\nthe cave of the Cyclops and waiting their turn to be devoured\u201d\n(Rousseau 1917, 125). We might claim that absolute rule and absolute\nsubmission produce a sort of peace. But this is peace conjoined with\ninjustice. So it is clear that the sort of peace that is worth\npursuing is peace that is also linked to justice. The idea of justice\nis at the heart of the just war tradition, which claims that we are\nentitled to fight back against injustice. As Patrick Henry asked in\nhis famous \u201cGive me Liberty or Give me Death Speech\u201d:\n\u201cIs life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the\nprice of chains and slavery?\u201d One might claim that the peace of\nthe Cyclops\u2019 cave is not peace at all but a state of war.\n\nMost pacifists will claim that the false peace of slavery is not what\nthey have in mind. Rather, for the majority of pacifists, pacifism is\nnot simply acquiescing passively to evil\u2014pacifism is not\npassive-ism. Rather, pacifism involves actively but nonviolently\nresisting evil. Nonetheless, some pacifists, such as Tolstoy, do\nappear to advocate nonresistance. Tolstoy said, for example,\n\u201cthe only means of deliverance from violence is the submissive\nand peaceful endurance of it\u201d (Tolstoy 1906, 36; see\nChristoyannopoulos 2020). Nonresistant pacifists in the Christian\ntradition often base the idea of submitting to evil on Jesus\u2019\nideas as expressed in the Sermon on the Mount. \u201cDo not resist\none who is evil\u201d and \u201clove your enemies and pray for those\nwho persecute you\u201d (Matthew 5.39 and 5.44; Luke 6.27\u201330).\nSome Christian martyrs take this ideal seriously and look to\nJesus\u2019 life and execution as a model of pacific virtue.\n1.2 Peace as Modus Vivendi or Truce\n\nThe dialectical definition of peace as the absence of war can\nencompass the idea of the armed peace of the Cold War. Peace as the\nabsence of war may be a mere modus vivendi in which armed\nopponents refrain from attacking one another out of fear. This sort of\npeace is the peace of a truce or stalemate. While it is true that in\nsuch conditions, there is no overt damage done, the opponents have not\nbeen reconciled and hostile intentions have not been eliminated. Some\nmay claim that the best we can do to make peace is to reach a state of\ndetente that is made possible by mutual deterrent force. Related to\nthis is what might be called, following Raymond Aron, \u201cpeace by\nimpotence\u201d or peace by exhaustion (Aron 1966, 159 ff). In this\nsort of peace, the antagonistic parties are simply no longer willing\nto fight. Hostile intentions may persist; but the will to fight can no\nlonger be actualized. Kant rejected this sort of peace, claiming that\npeace means \u201can end to all hostilities\u201d (Kant 1991, 93).\nThis is why Kant maintains that the first principle of perpetual peace\nis that states should not make \u201csecret reservation of the\nmaterial for future war\u201d (93).\n\nThose who call themselves \u201cpacifists\u201d will usually agree\nwith Kant that a mere modus vivendi produced by impotence or\nexhaustion is not actually peace, since hostile intent remains. And\npacifists will argue that the peace of deterrence and detente are not\nreally peace either, because they are the result of an increase in\narmaments and the threat of escalating violence.\n1.3 Peace of a Just and Tranquil Order\n\nOpposed to peace as modus vivendi is what Aron calls,\n\u201cpeace by satisfaction\u201d (Aron 1966, 160 ff). This is a\npeace that results from a lack of grievances and hostility. In the\nhistory of the West, this sort of peace is often linked to what\nAugustine called the \u201ctranquility of order\u201d (Augustine\n1958, Book 19, Chapter 13) In recent Western thought, this idea often\nfollows Kant in claiming that liberal democracy is the key to such a\ntranquil order.\n\nFrancis Fukuyama\u2019s Hegelian idea about the \u201cend of\nhistory,\u201d for example, hoped that the end of the Cold War would\nbring about the end of war in general, as liberal-democracy spread\n(Fukuyama 1992). Similarly, Michael Doyle has claimed that democracies\ndo not go to war with one another (Doyle 1997; see Gursozlu 2017).\nJohn Rawls has explained the stability of well-ordered democratic\nstates as follows: \u201cThere is true peace among them because all\nsocieties are satisfied with the status quo for the right\nreasons\u201d (Rawls 1999, 47). More recently, this idea about the\nstabilizing and peace-making power of democracy has influenced\nneo-conservative ideas in U.S. foreign policy, where the hope is that\npeace will occur as democracy is spread.\n\nThe idea that peace is founded in a just political order is connected\nto the ideas of the just war tradition. Defenders of the just war\ntradition\u2014from Augustine to Walzer\u2014argue that occasionally\nit is necessary to make war in order to establish such a tranquil and\njust social condition. More recent defenders of the just war idea have\nargued that interventionist wars should be fought in order to create\nstable conditions by defending human rights (see\n footnote 1).\n\nPacifists will disagree with those who claim that wars should be\nfought in pursuit of the ideal of a just and stable social order.\nProponents of humanitarian intervention maintain that war is a\nsuitable means for attaining the goal of respect for human rights and\nsatisfaction of human needs; but pacifists will argue that only\nnonviolent means are coherent with the these intended ends.\n1.4 Positive Peace\n\nPositive definitions of peace go beyond merely dialectical definitions\nof peace as the opposite of war and instead focus on peace as a state\nof rest, wholeness, or completion. The peace of a just and tranquil\norder points toward something like a condition of wholeness in which\nthere is solidarity, mutual respect, and satisfaction of needs. In\nthis vision of peace there is genuine community and human flourishing.\nThis includes not only the absence of direct violence but also the\nabsence of structural violence (Galtung 1969). The concept of\nstructural violence has been widely discussed in recent years in\nconnection with racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression.\nStructural violence involves very generally practices and institutions\nthat undermine human flourishing and create social tension. One\ncentral concern from the standpoint of positive peace is the project\nof criticizing and remediating structural violence. This may include\nwhat Llewellyn (2018) has called \u201cemancipatory peace,\u201d i.e., peace\nrelated to liberation or emancipation from structures of oppression.\nThis also includes the work of peace education, as well as work on\nnonviolent conflict resolution and mediation (see Fitz-Gibbon 2010).\nRelated concerns point toward the importance of justice, with a\nspecial focus on restorative justice and community building. However,\nrecent work (Davenport, Melander, and Regan, 2018) in the field of\npeace studies has argued that positive peace is both too broad and too\nvague to be of use for empirical work in peace studies. The worry is\nthat the notion of positive peace includes a broad range of social and\npolitical concerns (equality, economic justice, environmental\nsustainability, and so on) that stray far from the core idea of peace\nas the absence of direct violence. Despite this criticism, the notion\nof positive peace remains in use.\n\nThe positive ideal of peace can be found in religious conceptions of\npeace. Stanley Hauerwas has explained that some Christian pacifists\nclaim that the concept of shalom (Hebrew for \u201cpeace\u201d) is focused\non positive peace: it is more than the absence of war; rather, it is\n\u201charmony, health, and well-being in all human relations\u201d (Hauerwas\n155). Shameer Mondongal maintains that something similar is found in\nIslam, where salaam is more than the absence of war, \u201cit also\nrequires the presence of justice and an atmosphere that promotes\nself-actualization\u201d (Mondongal 2023, 18). In some traditions, this\nappears to point beyond the merely political realm and aim toward\nspiritual transformation. In Christian contexts this is related to the\npeace of God that surpasses all understanding (as in Philippians 4.7).\nIn Buddhism, this is related to the idea propounded by Thich Nhat Hanh\n(1987) of \u201cbeing peace\u201d that is connected to Buddhist\npractice. The Dalai Lama claims that peace is more than the absence of\nwar and he connects his vision of world peace to peacefulness as a\nstate of mind: \u201cpeace is a state of tranquility founded on the\ndeep sense of security that arises from mutual understanding,\ntolerance of others\u2019 point of view, and respect for their\nrights\u201d (Dalai Lama, 202). This is closely related to the ideal\nof social stability; but the Dalai Lama also connects it to the deeper\nprocess of personal transformation.\n1.5 Peace as a Virtue and Intrinsic Value\n\nBuilding upon these ideas, Michael Fox has described \u201cpeace as a\nway of life\u201d: \u201ca peaceful way of life will be such as to\nincorporate nonviolence toward oneself and others, and will be guided\nby cooperation, mutual respect, creative problem-solving, negotiation\nof differences, and caring concern or compassion\u201d (Fox 2014,\n202).This conception of peace is not mere quietism or passivity. Jay\nMcDaniel (2005) has argued in favor of a notion of \u201ccreative\npeace\u201d in which there is tension and activity as individuals and\ncultures must learn to listen to and interact with one another. This\nnotion of peace as a way of life can be understood in connection with\nvirtue ethics, where peacefulness is understood as a virtue that is\nconnected to other virtues such as modesty, tolerance, and mercy\n(virtue ethics is discussed further below).\n\nAs we conclude this consideration of what peace means in pacifism, it\nis important to note that pacifists often view peace as an\nend-in-itself or as a having a kind of intrinsic value. This is\nexpressed in a variety of ways by pacifists. Pope Francis has said,\nfor example, \u201cPeace alone is holy. Peace alone is holy, not war\u201d\n(Francis 2017). This idea has roots in Augustine, who says in The\nCity of God that peace is the summum bonum(Augustine 1958,\nbook 19, chapter 11). This is connected to Augustine\u2019s idea that we\nshould only go to war if we are aiming at peace. Of course, that idea\nis central to the just war tradition that develops after Augustine.\nPacifists have responded by arguing that there ought to be a unity of\nmeans and ends and stipulating that only nonviolent means may be\nemployed in pursuit of peace. This notion of peace as the summum\nbonum has been developed in Islamic thought by Wahiduddin Khan\n(2015), who suggests that peace is like the soil that provides a\nfoundation for all other good things.\n\nThis conception of peace as having intrinsic value helps explain how\npacifists may respond to the question of what peace is good for. If\npeace is conceived as having intrinsic value, it is not good for\nanything else; it is simply good in itself. In understanding peace in\nthis way, pacifists may rely on a kind of intuitionism that holds that\npeace and its value are known through a kind of moral intuition. Fiala\nhas developed this account of pacifist metaethics (Fiala 2022b),\nbuilding on work in pacifist metaethics done by Holmes (Holmes 2017a\nand 2015). Those who hold that peace is an end-in-itself with\nintrinsic value may question the idea that peace should be understood\nin instrumental terms. For example, some will argue that peace is good\nbecause it produces prosperity (see Pinker 2011). But for pacifists\nwho hold that peace has intrinsic value, we should do not pursue peace\nbecause it leads to prosperity; rather, we ought to pursue peace for\nits own sake. \n\nPositive peace can be best understood from the tradition of virtue\nethics, where peacefulness is understood as a virtue that is connected\nto other virtues such as modesty, tolerance, and mercy. It is\nimportant to note that peace is not mere quietism and the passivity of\nmeditation or contemplation. Jay McDaniel (2005) has argued in favor\nof a notion of \u201ccreative peace\u201d in which there is tension\nand activity as individuals and cultures must learn to listen to and\ninteract with one another.\n2. Varieties of Pacifism\n\nPacifism includes a wide variety of ideas and commitments. Pacifism\nhas typically been understood as a critical or negative argument\nagainst war (or violence), even though Fiala has argued that pacifism\ncould be understood as a comprehensive normative theory that\npostulates peace as the highest good (Fiala 2018a). Pacifism in its\nbroadest sense can be distinguished from application of pacifist\ncritique to particular issues such as: domestic violence (Hall\nFitzgibbon 2017), environmental issues (Woods 2017), the death penalty\n(Steffen 2017), nonhuman animals (Chapple 2017), and so on. This\narticle will not focus on those applications. Rather, it organizes the\nvariety of pacifisms in several ways according to interrelated\nconceptual distinctions: absolute and contingent pacifism; maximal and\nminimal pacifism; universal vs. particular pacifism. These\ndistinctions overlap, as we shall see here.\n2.1 Absolute vs. Contingent Pacifism\n\nThis distinction organizes different answers to the question of how\nobligated we are to reject violence and war. Absolute pacifism is\nunderstood as a maximal and universal rejection of violence and war.\nAbsolutism in ethics (or moral absolutism) holds that moral principles\nare eternal and unchanging and that they admit no exceptions. So,\nabsolute pacifism holds that war and violence are always wrong. One\nrecent proponent of a version of absolute pacifism is Michael Allen\nFox. Fox argues that war is inconsistent with morality and with human\nwell-being. He concludes by asserting a \u201cvery strong form of\npacifism\u201d and admits that this results in some uncomfortable\nconclusions, such as that \u201ceven military action aimed at\nprotecting people against acute and systematic human-rights violations\ncannot be justified\u201d (Fox 2014, 126). Fox explains that pacifism\nresults in a difficult dilemma that is reminiscent of the question of\nwhether two wrongs can make a right. Fox asks, \u201cShould immoral\nactions be used to stop other (perhaps gravely more) immoral\nactions?\u201d(Fox 2014, 127). He answers \u201cNo,\u201d and\nmaintains that this shows us that we have to work to find ways to move\nbeyond our reliance on war as the solution to social and political\nproblems. A similar conclusion has been argued by Holmes who concludes\nthat morality and warfare are \u201cantithetical\u201d (Holmes 2017a\np.25).\n\nNon-absolute pacifism may be called contingent pacifism. While\nabsolute pacifism admits no exceptions to the rejection of war and\nviolence, contingent pacifism is usually understood as a principled\nrejection of a particular war. A different version of contingent\npacifism can also be understood to hold that pacifism is only an\nobligation for a particular group of individuals and not for everyone.\nContingent pacifism can also be a principled rejection of a particular\nmilitary system or set of military policies. Contingent pacifists may\naccept the permissibility or even necessity of war in some\ncircumstances and reject it in others, while absolute pacifists will\nalways and everywhere reject war and violence.\n\nAbsolute pacifism is often connected with a religious standpoint in\nwhich nonviolence is seen as a religious commandment. Thomas Merton\nexplains that Gandhi and most other absolute pacifists have a larger\nmetaphysical view: \u201cas Gandhi saw, the fully consistent practice\nof nonviolence demands a solid metaphysical basis both in being and in\nGod\u201d (Merton 1971, 209). There is an open question about how\n\u201cabsolute\u201d Gandhi was in his pacifism (Fiala 2022a), but it is\nclear that he is often viewed as a paradigmatic figure of what we\nAllen calls \u201cabsolute nonviolence\u201d (Allen 2022). In the West,\nabsolute pacifism is often derived from the Christian ideal of\nnonresistance to evil as required by Jesus\u2019 pronouncements about\nnonresistance in the Sermon on the Mount (in Matthew) or the Sermon on\nthe Plain (in Luke). In Indian traditions, it is grounded in the\ncommitment to ahimsa or nonviolence that is derived from a larger\nmetaphysical picture which emphasizes karmic interdependence, ascetic\nself-abnegation, and compassion. The religious foundation of absolute\npacifism is often tied to the idea that there is merit in suffering\nviolence without retaliating. As Martin Luther King Jr. puts this,\n\u201cunearned suffering is redemptive\u201d (King 1986, 18).\n\nAbsolute pacifism is an ideal. Some versions of absolute pacifism go\nso far as to abjure the idea of personal self-defense. Other absolute\npacifists may allow for personal self-defense while rejecting the\nimpersonal and political violence of war. Almost every defender of\nabsolute pacifism recognizes the difficulty of attaining to the\nabsolute idea. Gandhi writes the following in his autobiography:\n\u201cMan cannot for a moment live without consciously or\nunconsciously committing outward himsa (violence)\u2026 A\nvotary of ahimsa (nonviolence) therefore remains true to this\nfaith if the spring of all his actions is compassion, if he shuns to\nthe best of his ability the destruction of the tiniest creature, tries\nto save it, and thus incessantly strives to be free from the deadly\ncoil of himsa. He will be constantly growing in self-restraint and\ncompassion, but he can never become entirely free from outward\nhimsa\u201d (Gandhi 1993, 439). The absolute ideal is nearly\nimpossible to achieve because we must harm other beings in order to\nsurvive: we must kill in order to eat. And the world often presents us\nwith difficult \u201ckill or be killed\u201d choices as in the\nquestion of self-defense or war. Absolute pacifists may hold that it\nis better to be killed than to kill. But such a choice may be\nimpossible for many of us to make. Pacifists will often argue that\nthis way of describing a situation\u2014as one where the choice is\n\u201ckill or be killed\u201d\u2014usually presents us with a false\ndilemma: often there are other nonviolent alternatives to either\nkilling or being killed. But when presented with such a stark choice,\nabsolute pacifism may require self-sacrifice.\n\nContingent or conditional pacifism qualifies such an uncompromising\ncondemnation of violence and warfare. Albert Einstein and Bertrand\nRussell, for example, were both supporters of the war against Nazi\nGermany, despite the fact that each considered himself to be a\npacifist. Russell identified his position as what he called\n\u201crelative political pacifism\u201d (Russell 1943). Russell uses\nthe word \u201crelative\u201d to describe the contingent nature of\nthe commitment to peace: one\u2019s commitment to pacifism depends\nupon or is relative to the nature of the war. Relative pacifism means,\nfor Russell, \u201cthat very few wars are worth fighting,\nand that the evils of war are almost always greater than they\nseem to excited populations at the moment when war breaks out\u201d\n(Russell 1943, 8). Russell calls his position \u201cpolitical\u201d\nbecause his emphasis is on war and political institutions, not on a\npersonal commitment to nonviolence.\n\nAlong these lines, David Cortright has described what he calls\n\u201crealistic pacifism.\u201d Cortright claims that in the realm\nof nuclear war, pacifism is absolute. But in other sorts of conflict,\npacifism is \u201cconditional and pragmatic\u201d and\n\u201cpredicated on a presumption against armed violence, but it\nacknowledges that the use of force, constrained by rigorous ethical\nstandards, may be necessary at times for self-defense and the\nprotection of the innocent\u201d (Cortright 2008, 334). Such an idea\nis clearly related to just war theory. Indeed, some authors (such as\nLarry May) have derived contingent pacifism from just war\nthinking.\n\nThere are several varieties of contingent pacifism. A basic\ndistinction to be made here is whether one\u2019s argument against a\ngiven war is is merely occasional or situational (what we might call a\ncontingently pacifist argument against a given war); or whether one is\noffering a broader argument against wars of a certain type or wars\nthat are generally fought under certain conditions (see Fiala 2014;\nMorrow 2017).\n\nFirst, pacifism may not be required of all moral agents. Thus pacifism\nmay only be required for members of particular professions. Pacifism\nis often thought to be a professional obligation of certain religious\nvocations. But such a vocation may be thought of as a choice of\nconscience that is not universally required. In this version of\ncontingent pacifism, the prohibition against violence only applies to\nthose who take a vow or make a pledge to renounce violence and war.\nWithin this two-tiered approach, the vow of peacefulness might be\nconsidered as a sort of supererogatory ideal that is not required of\nothers. But it is also possible for the two-tier approach to contain\nan implicit condemnation of those who do not take up the higher\ncalling of pacifism.\n\nA second sort of contingent pacifism holds that if a particular war or\nmilitary policy is prudentially unwise it should be resisted. Such\nprudential pacifism is based upon cost-benefit analyses focused on the\nfacts of particular conflicts. A more principled sort of prudential\npacifism can be based upon the general claim that war usually causes\nmore harm than good.\n\nA third sort of contingent pacifism will appeal to the just war theory\nand claim that a given war is unjust according to this theory. As John\nRawls says of what he calls \u201ccontingent pacifism,\u201d\n\u201cthe possibility of a just war is conceded but not under present\ncircumstances\u201d (Rawls 1971, 382). This idea is closely related\nto \u201cjust war pacifism\u201d as developed in the last couple of\ndecades by critics of the just war tradition: just war pacifism\nmaintains that modern wars are not fought according to the standards\nof the just war theory because, for example, they make use of aerial\nbombardment and other means that do not adequately discriminate\nbetween combatants and noncombatants. Such a claim may result in a\nnearly absolute proscription against war under present circumstances.\nAnd it may contain an absolute prohibition against certain sorts of\nwar, such as nuclear war. Most so-called \u201cjust war\npacifists\u201d are contingent pacifists in this sense: they object\nto the way modern wars are fought.\n\nWith the just war theory in mind, contingent pacifism may focus either\non the basis for war (as in the just war idea of jus ad\nbellum), on the way that the war is being fought (as in the just\nwar idea of jus in bello), or on the expected outcome of the\nwar (as in the idea of jus post bellum). With regard to\njus ad bellum, contingent pacifists may reject the legitimacy\nof the authority who is fighting, they may claim that war is not being\nfought as a last resort, or they may deny that the war is being fought\nfor a just cause. With regard to jus in bello, contingent\npacifist may worry that innocent noncombatants are being harmed or\nthat soldiers are employing means mala in se (such as rape or\ntorture). Finally, with regard to jus post bellum, contingent\npacifists may object to wars that will undermine long-term peace,\njustice, and stability.\n\nA fourth form of contingent pacifism might be called \u201cpolitical\npacifism.\u201d This approach adheres to pacifism as a strategic\npolitical commitment within an adversarial system. In political\ndiscourse, the so-called \u201cdoves\u201d are usually not absolute\npacifists. Rather, they define themselves in opposition to the\n\u201chawks\u201d who advocate war and funding for the war-system.\nPolitical pacifists need not have an absolute commitment to\nnonviolence; nor need they have a principled commitment to the ideas\nof the just war theory. Rather, they can reject militaristic policies\nfor strategic political purposes that have to do with budget\npriorities or other issues. Political pacifism may seem to be merely\nopportunistic; but opposition parties who offer critical perspectives\non militarism are an important component of adversarial democracy.\nMoreover, political pacifists can end up forming useful coalitions\nwith other more principled pacifists and absolute pacifists.\n\nFinally, another version of contingent pacifism can be called,\nfollowing Robert Holmes, \u201cliberal-democratic\u201d or\n\u201cliberal pacifism.\u201d Holmes argues that modern warfare runs\ncounter to the values of liberal-democracy. Thus those who are\ncommitted to liberal values should not support war. Essential for this\nclaim is the idea that \u201cno one has a right to command others to\nkill, and no one is justified in killing on command\u201d (Holmes\n1999, 398). The sort of pacifism that is derived from this claim is\ncontingent upon the fact that modern warfare involves a hierarchically\norganized military system and mass conscription. It is possible that\nwar could be fought without conscription or without military\nhierarchy; but Holmes argues that this is unlikely in the modern\nworld. Moreover, this sort of pacifism is contingent upon our social\nand political commitments. Those who are committed to other social and\npolitical ideologies may find that war and the war system are morally\nand politically acceptable.\n\nContingent pacifism is often based upon empirical and historical\njudgments about the way wars are fought. Such judgments will vary\ndepending upon changing circumstances. And these judgments are also\ncontingent upon the availability of information about why and how wars\nare fought. It is possible, then, that contingent pacifists can admit\nthat there may be conflicting judgments about the justice of a\nparticular war. Unlike contingent pacifism, absolute pacifism rejects\nwar in an a priori fashion: one of the first principles of absolute\npacifism is that war (or violence more generally) is always wrong.\nThus absolute pacifism will claim that any judgment that leads to the\njustification of war is wrong.\n2.2 Maximal vs. Minimal Pacifism\n\nThe difference between maximal (or broad) and minimal (or narrow)\npacifism has to do with the extent of the commitment to nonviolence.\nThis difference can be explained with reference to the questions of\nwhat sorts of violence are rejected, and who is the recipient or\nbeneficiary of nonviolent concern. Pacifists reject violence and war.\nBut there is an open question about how war and violence are defined\nand thus about what sorts of actions are rejected by pacifists. There\nis, of course, a continuum between maximal and minimal pacifism, with\nmaximal pacifism rejecting all forms of war and violence. Minimal\nversions of pacifism fall away from this in various directions.\nMaximal pacifism is closely related to absolute and universal\nformulations of pacifism; minimal pacifism has more in common with\ncontingent and particular versions of pacifism.\n\nThere are a variety of actions that can be described as\n\u201cwar\u201d: terrorism, insurgency, civil war, humanitarian\nintervention, full-fledged inter-state conflict, and world war that\nincludes the possible employment of nuclear weapons. Most pacifists\nwill reject nuclear war and full-fledged inter-state conflict. But\nthere are differences about whether, for example, civil war or\nhumanitarian intervention can be justified. For example, some who\ncould be described as pacifists supported the use of military force\nduring the American Civil War (William Lloyd Garrison, for example,\ncompromised his pacifist beliefs to support the cause of emancipating\nthe slaves). At issue in thinking about these differences are\nquestions about the importance of key values such as sovereignty and\nhuman rights, as well as the question of how best to create stability\nin the face of social unrest. One difficult issue for some pacifists\nis the question of using violence in defense of human rights or in\nopposition to tyranny. Maximal pacifists will reject all use of\nmilitary force, even in defense against dictators or in response to\nhuman rights violations.\n\nMaximal versions of pacifism will condemn all taking of life.\nPacifists may also extend their rejection of violence to include a\nrejection of the death penalty, meat-eating, and abortion. More narrow\nversions of pacifism may take into account the distinction between the\ninnocent and the guilty, holding only that the innocent may not be\nharmed. This distinction is important for thinking about the question\nof noncombatant immunity in war, with many pacifists arguing that war\nis wrong because it puts the innocent at risk. Some opponents of the\ndeath penalty will make a similar argument about the death penalty and\nthe risk of executing the innocent. And opponents of abortion will\nalso claim that it harms the innocent. The connection between war, the\ndeath penalty, and abortion is made in the Catholic \u201cseamless\ngarment\u201d approach to the problem of developing a\n\u201cconsistent ethic of life.\u201d This approach condemns all\nactions that harm innocent persons; and it is often extended toward a\nrejection of all harm, without regard for the distinction between\ninnocence and guilt. Such a view has been defended most famously by\nPope John Paul II, who rejected (or was skeptical toward) all sorts of\nviolence including war, the death penalty, suicide, euthanasia, and\nabortion. Pacifists may also extend moral concern to include concern\nfor all sentient beings; and thus pacifists may also condemn\nmeat-eating and animal cruelty. Gandhi, for example, extended ahimsa\nmaximally to include avoiding harm to sentient beings.\n2.3 Universal vs. Particular Pacifism\n\nThis distinction has to do with the issue of whether everyone is\nrequired to be a pacifist or whether pacifism can be a moral choice of\nsome particular individuals. This is related to the question of\nwhether pacifism is a duty for all or whether it supererogatory. While\nthe distinction between universal and particular pacifism is related\nto the distinction between absolute and contingent pacifism, it is\nprimarily focused on the question of who is obligated by\npacifism. Universalism in thinking about pacifism will hold that if\nwar is wrong, it is wrong for everyone and thus that soldiers who\nfight are wrong, as are those who support the war system that\nencourages them to fight. Particular pacifists articulate their\nposition as merely personal and do not condemn the war system or\nsoldiers who choose to fight. Universal pacifism is closely connected\nwith absolute and maximal versions of pacifism; particular pacifism is\nrelated to contingent and minimal pacifisms.\n\nOne way that this distinction between universal and particular\npacifism has been enacted in history is through the idea of vocational\npacifism discussed above Vocational pacifism holds that pacifism is a\nspecial obligation of a particular vocational service; but that it is\nnot required of all. In this sense, pacifism is a supererogatory\nobligation. Religious clerics may thus be required to renounce\nviolence, while ordinary members of their congregations may not be so\nobliged. Particular pacifism is thus connected to contingent pacifism:\nthe moral demand of pacifism may be contingent upon one\u2019s social\nposition.\n\nThis distinction can be understood by considering whether pacifism is\nmorally necessary or whether it is merely morally permitted. The\nuniversalist answer to this question is: if war and violence are\nwrong, then pacifism is morally necessary and those who fight are\nwrong. But some pacifist appear to hold that it is not wrong\nto fight (or that some persons are permitted to fight), even\nthough the pacifists herself may choose (or is obliged by some\nvocational commitment) not to fight. A conscientious objector may thus\nchoose not to fight while not condemning those who do. Conscientious\nrefusal may be articulated as a personal belief about pacifism that\ndoes not apply to others. This is one way pacifists who refuse to\nfight may avoid the charge that they are traitors who are opposed to\ntheir compatriots who fight: they may deny that their refusal has any\nuniversal moral significance or application. Eric Reitan has argued\nthat one may adopt a sort of \u201cpersonal pacifism\u201d that need\nnot be universally applied. One way of understanding this is to\nconnect it with the idea of tolerance. A personal pacifist may believe\nthat pacifism is the right choice; but she may choose to tolerate\nothers who do not make the same choice. A personal pacifist may also\nespouse a sort of relativism that holds that a commitment to pacifism\nis merely a personal commitment that cannot be used to condemn others\nwho make different commitments.\n\nThis idea of particular pacifism is a subtle one. And critics will\nargue that it is incoherent, especially if it is understood as a sort\nof relativism. Those who claim that conscientious objectors are\ntraitors may argue that pacifism cannot be a particular or personal\nchoice. Critics of pacifism will argue that pacifism is morally wrong\nbecause they think that patriotism or justice requires fighting or at\nleast supporting the war effort. This objection would hold that if a\nwar is justified, then conscientious objectors are wrong to reject it.\nParticularists may reply by claiming that their rejection of war is a\npersonal choice without universal significance.\n2.4 Skeptical and Prima Facie Pacifism\n\nArguments in defense of pacifism are usually based on assertions about\nthe immorality of violence and war. Thus pacifism is usually derived\nby negation. Pacifism, primarily, tells us what not to do. As Cheyney\nRyan has argued, pacifism is a \u201cskeptical position.\u201d As\nRyan puts this: \u201cits general claim is that the proponent of\nkilling cannot produce a single compelling argument for why killing\nanother person is permissible\u201d (Ryan 1983, 509). One of the\nskeptical problems that Ryan addresses is the problem that occurs in\nkilling in self-defense. When a Victim kills an Aggressor in\nself-defense, this killing occurs before the Aggressor has actualized\nhis malicious intention. In this case, killing in self-defense is out\nof proportion to the harm done, since the Victim who kills in\nself-defense was not himself killed. A skeptical version of pacifism\ncan thus develop from the worry that when we choose to kill in\nself-defense, we never know whether this killing is in fact\njustifiable.\n\nThis sort of skeptical position can be linked to the just war\ntradition\u2019s concern with the question of \u201clast\nresort\u201d in thinking about jus ad bellum. Skeptical\npacifists wonder how we would know that we ever reach the stage of\nlast resort, when violence becomes necessary. One way that pacifists\narticulate this concern is to focus on the variety of nonviolent\nmeasures that could be employed before it becomes necessary to resort\nto force. Indeed, it may be argued that to resort to violence is to\nadmit to a failure of imagination and to give up hope that more humane\nforms of problem solving and conflict resolution can be effective.\nMoreover, pacifists will note that it is not sufficient to try\nnonviolent methods once and then disregard them. Rather, one must\nengage in a variety of nonviolent actions; and one must try these\nnonviolent alternatives more than once.\n\nA somewhat different version of skeptical pacifism can be found in\ncritiques of militarism and the ideology and propaganda that lead\npeople to support war. This skeptical stance has been defended by\nFiala (Fiala 2008 and 2010). In this approach, skepticism produces a\npractical political pacifism that is based upon the fact that citizens\nhave no good reason to trust that their governments are telling them\nthe truth about war and its justification. This skepticism is derived\nfrom historical judgments about the tendency of governments to\nmanipulate information in order to provoke the citizenry toward war.\nIn light of such skepticism, the burden of proof for the justification\nof war is placed upon the government, who must prove that the\ndangerous and presumptively immoral activity of war can in fact be\njustified.\n\nThis sort of skepticism might also be called \u201cprima facie\npacifism\u201d: this is the idea that war is usually wrong except in\ncertain extraordinary circumstances when it is compellingly shown that\nthe evil of war is a sort of lesser evil that is necessary for some\ngreater good. Prima facie pacifism presumes that war is wrong but\nallows for exceptions. Prima facie pacifism places the burden of proof\nupon the proponent of war: it is up to the proponent of war to prove,\nin a given circumstance, that war is in fact morally necessary.\n2.5 Transformational Pacifism\n\nTransformational pacifism is understood as aiming at a transformation\nof psychological, cultural, social, and moral sensibility away from\nacceptance of violence and war. Transformational pacifism articulates\na broad framework of cultural criticism and includes an effort to\nreform educational and cultural practices that tend to support\nviolence and war. The goal of transformational pacifism is a world in\nwhich war and violence appear to be archaic remnants of less civilized\npast. The author of the present entry has contributed to the idea of\n\u201ctransformative pacifism\u201d as a critical theory of society\nthat critiques militarism and the assumptions of warrior culture while\noffering a more peaceful ethical alternative (Fiala 2018).\n\nOne traditional version of transformational pacifism can be found in\npacifist religious traditions. For example, Jesus articulated a\nrevaluation of values from the standpoint of a more pacific\nunderstanding of God\u2019s commandments. Instead of retaliation and\nthe logic of \u201can eye for eye,\u201d Jesus claimed that we must\nevolve a new idea\u2014of not returning evil for evil.\nTransformational pacifism is often connected to a progressive\ninterpretation of history that points toward a pacifist goal for human\nevolution. Gandhi thought that such progress was already underway and\nthat history \u201chas been steadily progressing towards ahimsa\n(nonviolence)\u201d (Gandhi 1972, 310\u201311).\n\nTransformational pacifism has been described by Joseph J.\nFahey\u2014who also calls it \u201creconstructionist\u201d\npacifism\u2014as follows: \u201ctransformational pacifists stress\nthe spiritual unity of all people\u2026 they seek not only the\nabolition of war, but also the creation of an international juridical,\npolitical, and economic order that will promote the rights of all\nspecies\u201d (Fahey 1997, 393). War resistance can be located under\nthis general rubric\u2014insofar as war resistance is linked to a\ngeneral criticism of those structures of authority, economic and\npolitical choices, and institutional frameworks that support what is\noften called \u201cthe war system\u201d (see Atack 2001).\n\nTransformational pacifism can also be linked to feminism and feminist\ncritiques of the masculine values found in warrior cultures and the\nwar system (see Poe 2017. Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams is a\nprominent figure here. Addams connected her pragmatic hope for peace\nto democracy and the empowerment of women and the oppressed masses,\nwho had in the past silently suffered from the horrors of war. During\nWorld War I, Addams and her Women\u2019s Peace Party worked to end\nthe war and eventually ended up creating the Women\u2019s\nInternational League for Peace and Freedom. More recently authors such\nas Sara Ruddick and Nel Noddings have connected feminist criticism\nwith pacifism and the ethics of care. Ruddick notes that military\nthinking utilizes a variety of conceptual strategies that create a\nmyth of \u201cthe manly just warrior, which interlocks myths of\nmasculinity, sacrifice, and heroic death\u201d (Ruddick 1995, 202).\nNoddings has noted that \u201ccare ethics\u201d does not support\nabsolute pacifism, since care-givers may in rare circumstances kill in\norder to defend those they love. Nonetheless, Noddings argues that\ncare ethics and feminism are concerned with a general critique of the\nmilitaristic and violent assumptions of male-dominant culture.\nNoddings contends that our culture \u201cputs a high value on the\naggressive tendencies of males\u201d (Noddings 2010, 215). Her\nsolution is to re-create culture and education in such as way as to\ndevalue aggression and provide support for love, nurturance,\nsolidarity, and care.\n3. Consequentialist Pacifism\n\nDeontological prohibitions against war are usually absolute, while\nconsequentialist prohibitions against war are for the most part\ncontingent.\n\nConsequentialist pacifism is usually grounded in some sort of\nrule-utilitarianism. A utilitarian pacifist may argue that a rule\nagainst war or other sorts of violence will tend to promote the\ngreatest happiness for the greatest number. A broader prohibition\nagainst violence other than war can extend the \u201cgreatest\nhappiness\u201d concept to take into account the happiness of\nsentient beings other than humans.\n\nUtilitarian pacifists must appeal to empirical and historical data to\nsupport this rule. A utilitarian argument for pacifism could be\ngrounded in the claim that history shows us that wars tend to produce\nmore harm than good. As Bentham put it, \u201cThe happiest of mankind\nare sufferers by war; and the wisest, nay, even the least wise, are\nwise enough to ascribe the chief of their sufferings to that\ncause\u201d (Bentham 1789, Fourth Essay) One of the problems for\nconsequentialist arguments against war is that judgments vary about\nwhether war always causes more suffering than it prevents. Utilitarian\ndefenders of the just war theory will argue that some wars help\nalleviate suffering, as for example, in the case of humanitarian wars\nin defense of human rights.\n\nUtilitarian pacifists may articulate a rule-based argument that holds\nthat a general rule against war will, in the long run, produce more\nhappiness. A utilitarian might support such an argument by also\narguing that economic and other resources that are spent on war and\npreparation for war could produce more happiness if spent on peaceful\ngoods such as education, hunger relief, and so on. And a\nrule-utilitarian might argue that a rule against humanitarian\nintervention would produce more happiness in the long run by\nprotecting international stability and preserving important values\nlike national sovereignty.\n\nIt is important to note that, unlike deontological pacifism,\nconsequentialist pacifism is not opposed to killing per se. Nor is the\nconsequentialist approach especially concerned with the distinction\nbetween combatants and noncombatants, since the \u201cgreatest\nhappiness\u201d principle adopts a perspective that includes both\ncombatants and noncombatants. Indeed, the combatant/noncombatant\ndistinction is better understood as a deontological principle, as\ndiscussed below. It is difficult to see how absolute pacifism can\ndevelop from act-utilitarianism that is devoid of side-constraints\nagainst killing. The rule-utilitarian approach can, however, allow for\ngeneral rules that allow killing in certain circumstances, say in\nself-defense. The idea of proportionality in just war theory is an\nexample of such a rule: killing in war is justifiable if it promotes\ngeneral long-term happiness.\n\nThe claim that war produces more harm than good is disputable; at\nleast, it requires empirical research to decide if it is true.\nEmpirical research into the consequences of war provides mixed results\ndepending upon contexts and circumstances in which wars are fought and\nthe range of consequences considered (whether short-term or\nlong-term). Some authors (Pinker and Goldstein) suggest that the use\nof judicious military power during the last several decades has\nproduced good results. But other authors reach different conclusions.\nIan Bickerton concludes that the wars of the past 200 years have\nproduced ambiguous results: \u201cvictory did not achieve its desired\nresults and war sacrifices were largely in vain. The reality is that\nthe costs of war are rarely, if ever, worthwhile\u201d (Bickerton\n2011, xi).\n\nGiven the difficulty of assessing the empirical data, consequentialist\npacifism will usually be a sort of contingent pacifism. But this is\nnot always true, since absolute pacifism might be justifiable on\nconsequentialist grounds as a rule that will in the long run produce\ngood consequences. There may be variable judgments among\nconsequentialists about whether some wars produce more harm than good.\nThus pacifists such as Einstein and Russell could agree that the First\nWorld War was wrong, while admitting that the Second World War could\nbe justified. The Second World War is in fact often used as an example\nof a war that can be justified in consequentialist terms: the good\nproduced by the war\u2014the defeat of Nazism in Europe, for\nexample\u2014is thought to outweigh its negative consequences,\nespecially the massive numbers of persons killed in the war. In\nresponse, consequentialist pacifists might emphasize the negative\nutility of the deaths caused by the war while also arguing that the\nSecond World War produced long-term negative consequences with the\nintroduction of nuclear weapons, the partition of Europe, and the\nmadness of the Cold War. Consequentialist defenders of pacifism will\nalso argue that creative and coordinated nonviolent action can produce\ngood consequences that are at least as good as the consequences of\nwar.\n\nOne of the issues that consequentialists must consider is the temporal\nand spatial scope of our concern for consequences. It is possible that\nwars may produce short-term benefits for some and long-term\ndisadvantages for others. Judgments about benefits and harms are thus\ncomplex and we must clarify our understanding of what matters in\nthinking about consequences. Often consequentialist arguments for\npacifism emphasize the short-term damage of war. It is obviously true\nthat wars kill people. But the further question to be asked from the\nstandpoint of consequentialism is whether the harms that occur in the\nnear-term are outweighed by the long-term benefits of the war. Just\nwar theorists believe that some wars do have positive long-term\nconsequences. Pacifists do not think that long-term benefits outweigh\nsuch near-term harms. Consequentialist pacifists often also consider\nthe broad and long-term negative effects of war on the economy, on\nculture, on political life, and on the environment. Moreover,\npacifists worry that war contributes to long-term international\ninstability.\n\nWhen thinking about the negative consequences of war it is important\nto recognize that we are engaged in comparative cost-benefit analysis.\nCritics of consequentialist pacifism often skew the results of such\ncost-benefit analysis by comparing war to passivity or inaction. But\nmost forms of pacifism do not advocate complete passivity. It is a\nmistake to compare the consequences of going to war to the\nconsequences of doing nothing. Rather, the cost-benefit analysis must\ncompare the costs and benefits of going to war against those of\ncreative, organized, and sustained nonviolent action.\n\nA further consequentialist argument claims that cultures and states\nthat fight wars tend to become militaristic and expansionist. This\nargument focuses on the long-term negative consequences of a social\nand political system that is committed to militarism. One of these\nnegative consequences is the rise of the so-called\n\u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d in which social capital is\nexpended on military infrastructure at the expense of other social\nprojects. A negative consequence of militarism is the tendency of\nmilitarist states to become centralized, secretive, and imperial. This\ncritique of military expansionism can be connected to a general\ncritique of the potential negative consequences of imperial power. One\nsuch negative consequence is found in the illiberal tendencies of\nmilitary power. Another negative consequence can be found in the\npossibility of \u201cblow-back\u201d or retaliation in which those\nwho are subjugated turn against the colonial power. And other negative\nconsequences include the danger of an arms races and the wasted money\nand energy that are spent on preparing for war.\n\nEmpirical research is required to say whether it is true that what\npacifists often call \u201cthe war system\u201d does produce these\nnegative political consequences. Judgment about these empirical facts\nwill likely vary in accord with historical, geographical, and\npolitical differences, as well as in light of which consequences we\nchose to emphasize. Thus while pacifists argue that resources are\nsquandered in war and environmentalists will point out the military is\none of the largest polluters on the planet, proponents of war argue\nthat war and the military produces goods and technologies, such as\nairplanes, satellites, and so on, that are useful for civilians\n(Ruttan 2006).\n\nAnother consequentialist argument can be located in the idea of the\nsort of \u201cjust war pacifism\u201d that developed during the late\n20th Century (see Sterba 1998 and Neu 2011). One\nsignificant worry of just war pacifism is that modern wars fought with\nweapons of mass destruction can never be justified. There are\ndeontological concerns behind this sort of pacifism\u2014with regard\nto concern for noncombatants. But there are also consequentialist\nreasons to be skeptical of wars fought with weapons of mass\ndestruction, most notably the problem of escalation. Nuclear deterrent\nstrategy relies upon the threat of escalation to keep antagonists in\ncheck. The idea of deterrent strategy is to make the negative\nconsequences of war for the enemy so horrifying that war will not\noccur. But if the threat of escalation is real and the results of war\nare really so atrocious, then there are good consequentialist reasons\nto be opposed to war: wars fought with weapons of mass destruction\nwill tend to produce horrifying consequences including the potentially\ntotal devastation of what was called during the Cold War,\n\u201cmutually assured destruction.\u201d During the Cold War, this\nconcern was located in the worry about \u201cnuclear winter,\u201d\nwhich was the catastrophic destruction of the earth\u2019s climate\nand biosphere that would occur if an all out nuclear war had erupted.\nEven more limited conflicts that occur among states that possess\nweapons of mass destruction could produce horrible consequences.\nNuclear proliferation remains a concern along with the general threat\nof terrorists in possession of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nJust war pacifists generally claim that the negative consequences of\nmodern war make war unjustifiable. Just war pacifism might be more\nnarrowly focused on the immorality of nuclear war and nuclear\ndeterrence strategy. But those who reject nuclear warfare might still\nallow that limited defensive or even humanitarian wars can be fought\nprovided we could be sure that just war principles were respected.\nPerhaps the most important conclusion of just war pacifism is that the\nburden of proof rests on the proponent of war: for just war pacifists\nwho base their conclusions on consequentialist reasoning, war is\npresumed to produce negative consequences until is proved\notherwise.\n3.1 Active Nonviolence\n\nRelated to these consequentialist arguments against war is a more\npositive consequentialist argument about the positive power of\nnonviolence as a social force. This is grounded in a consequentialist\nargument that active nonviolence can produce social goods like respect\nfor human rights as well as peace and reconciliation.\n\nThe basic theory and strategy of nonviolent action were worked out by\nMohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Gene Sharp, and\nothers who were engaged in nonviolent social protest in the\n20th Century. Although the roots of this approach can be\nfound in the long history of pacifism from Jesus onward, the\nGandhi-King approach both clarified the basic principles of nonviolent\nresistance and successfully put these principles into action in the\nIndian struggle for self-determination and in the American civil\nrights movement. One of the important contributions of this approach\nis the idea that there should be a coordination between means and\nends. Peaceful means should be employed in pursuit of the end of peace\nand justice.\n\nFor peaceful means of social change to be effective, they must be\ncoordinated and organized. Gandhi and King thought that the power of\nnonviolence was linked to its ability to motivate and move large\nnumbers of people. Pacifism as a personal stance will not be effective\nat creating social change: it requires a coordinated social\neffort.\n\nProponents of active nonviolence will claim that coordinated\nnonviolence can be successful even in the face of aggression.\nAdvocates of this position will point to the successes of Gandhi and\nKing. They will also point to the \u201cvelvet revolutions\u201d\nthat occurred in Eastern Europe in the late 1980\u2019s and early\n1990\u2019s. And they will point to the example of Lithuania in\n1990\u201391, when unarmed civilians succeeded in turning back Soviet\ntroops. Some initially viewed the so-called \u201cArab Spring\u201d\nthat began in late 2010 as an example of the power of nonviolence.\nHowever, subsequent oppression by military and police forces remind us\nof the fragility of nonviolent social movements. Proponents of\nnonviolent action argue that nonviolence could be even more effective\nif society focused its resources on training citizens for nonviolent\nresistance and on coordinating nonviolent action. The ideal here would\nbe a sort of nonviolent \u201carmy\u201d that is funded, trained,\nand coordinated for national self-defense in a way that mimics\nmilitary training. For pacifism to be effective, the social\nresources\u2014money, technology, and investment of labor and\ncreative power\u2014that are currently used for military training\nwould have to be converted to nonviolent applications. This idea draws\non what James called \u201cthe moral equivalent of war\u201d and\nwhat Gandhi called the \u201cnonviolent army.\u201d\n4. Deontological Pacifism\n\nDeontological pacifism is closely related to absolute pacifism.\nDeontological approaches to morality focus on duty and right. One\ntypical idea for deontological pacifism is that there is a basic law\nor principle that prohibits killing, such as \u201cthou shall not\nkill.\u201d\n\nThe most famous theory of deontological ethics is Kant\u2019s.\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative is formulated as follows:\n\u201cAct according to that maxim by which you can at the same time\nwill that it should become a universal law\u201d (Kant 1990, 38). It\nis difficult to supply content to this imperative. Thus, it is not\nclear that the Kantian imperative can be used to rule out war. Indeed,\nKant is a defender of a version of the just war theory, in part\nbecause he believes that states have a duty to defend their citizens.\nAlthough Kant is not himself a pacifist, one might be able to ground\npacifism in Kant\u2019s alternative version of the moral law:\n\u201cAct so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or\nin that of another, always as an end and never as a means only\u201d\n(Kant 1990, 46). Some pacifists use the second formulation of the\ncategorical imperative to support their position by claiming that war\ntreats persons as means and does not respect them as ends in\nthemselves. One version of this idea has been defended by Soran\nReader, who argues that the basic presumption of the \u201cmoral\nstatus of persons\u201d leads to pacifism. Although Reader argues\nthat one can arrive at this perspective from both a consequentialist\napproach and a Kantian one, she relies on the basic intuition that\nrespect for persons as ends in themselves requires us not to kill\nthem. It is possible to use this deontological principle to support a\nmaximal extension of pacifism such that the prohibition against\nkilling might be extended to include a prohibition against killing\nnon-human persons. This interpretation would obviously require a\nfurther analysis of the notion of personhood. Another version of\ndeontological pacifism has been defended by Robert Holmes who claims\nthat morality, properly speaking, focuses on individuals, while war\nfocuses on defending collectives, which are not the proper focal point\nof morality (Holmes 2017b).\n\nIn addition to killing human persons, war violates the moral status of\npersons when, for example, soldiers are viewed as interchangeable cogs\nin the war machine. One might then criticize the apparent \u201cherd\nmentality\u201d of militarism, as Albert Einstein did when he called\nthe militaristic patriotism of the masses a sort of \u201cloathsome\nnonsense\u201d (Einstein 1954, 8) The idea of conscription seems to\nrun counter to the idea of respect for persons. And pacifists may\nargue that it is somehow disrespectful to require soldiers to conform\nto military virtues such as obedience to authority. Arguments against\nmilitarism along these lines were made famous by Thoreau who claimed\nthat in military service \u201cthe mass of men serve the State thus,\nnot as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies\u201d (Thoreau\n2000, 669)\n\nThe more important critique of the way that war betrays human dignity\ncan be found in the pacifist critique of the killing that happens in\nwar. Pacifists might claim that war is a violation of human rights.\nMore concretely the pacifist may claim that all human beings have a\nright to life and that killing in war violates this right.\n\nThis idea has been rejected by Anscombe, Narveson, and others who\nargue that the idea of human dignity or human rights can necessitate\nthe use of violence in defense of these rights. This sort of objection\nholds that it is both inconsistent and immoral for pacifists to reject\nthe use of violence in defense of human rights. As David Luban puts\nthis: \u201cSuch rights are worth fighting for. They are worth\nfighting for not only by those to whom they are denied but, if we take\nseriously the obligation which is indicated when we speak of human\nrights, by the rest of us as well\u201d (Luban 1980, 170).\n\nOne of the ways that pacifists can reply to this objection is to\nemphasize the difference between personal nonviolence and war.\nPacifists may accept that personal self-defense is acceptable; and\nthey may accept the idea of using violence in defense of the innocent\nin concrete personal encounters. (Of course, absolute pacifists who\nemphasized complete nonresistance will not accept such violence at\nall). But pacifism as anti-warism will argue that the violence of war\nis of a different kind. War is dehumanizing violence that kills masses\nof persons without any concern for them as persons. Along these lines,\nThomas Nagel claims that we should be able to justify to the victim\nwhat is being done to them, in light of morally relevant facts about\nthem. At the level of personal violence, it is possible to say that an\naggressor deserves the violence that is inflicted upon him. But at the\nlevel of war, this personal element is lost and instead we have\nkilling en masse, which is an assault on human dignity.\n4.1 Killing Combatants and Killing \u201cThe Guilty\u201d\n\nOne aspect of the deontological condemnation of war focuses on the\nkilling of combatants, although the killing of combatants has also\nbeen connected to contingent pacifism by way of just war\ntheory\u2019s proportionality constraint (Bazargan 2014). A pacifist\nmight argue that it is wrong to kill enemy combatants because killing\nis always wrong. Such an argument runs counter to the just war ideal\nthat combatants can be killed. Critics will argue that pacifism thus\nfails to distinguish between \u201cinnocence\u201d and\n\u201cguilt.\u201d As Anscombe puts this, \u201cpacifism teaches\npeople to make no distinction between the shedding of innocent blood\nand the shedding of any human blood\u201d (Anscombe 1981a, 58) The\njust war tradition holds that it is permissible to kill enemy\ncombatants because these combatants are, in some sense, no longer\ninnocent. Those who claim that it is acceptable to kill enemy\ncombatants claim that enemy soldiers deserve to die; or at least that\nit is not wrong to kill them. There are open questions in just war\ntheory about how this notion of desert functions. One of the problems\nis that young conscripted soldiers may not fully support the war into\nwhich they are drafted; and thus it may seem odd to claim that such\nsoldiers are guilty for or deserve to be killed in a war for which\nthey hold no personal responsibility (see McMahan 2009). But the most\nobvious way to justify killing combatants is to link such killing to\nthe notion of self-defense. In war, soldiers are confronted with enemy\ncombatants who will kill them and their comrades, if they aren\u2019t\nkilled first. In the language of just war theory, an enemy combatant\nis guilty of the crime of aggression; and in the context of war, this\ncrime is punishable by death.\n\nThis notion of killing as punishment can easily be connected to the\nissue of the death penalty. For deontological proponents of the death\npenalty, murderers can be executed because the nature of their crime\nmerits death. While consequentialists add in other considerations such\nas the deterrent value of the death penalty, the deontological\napproach focuses on the moral desert that is connected to the guilt of\nthe murderer. This notion of guilt\u2014as a moral quality that\nadheres to an individual in light of his past actions\u2014is also\nfound in the idea that enemy combatants may be killed. Those\nindividuals who are engaged in fighting have done something (or have\nadopted some characteristic) that makes it permissible to kill\nthem.\n\nAbsolute and maximal versions of deontological pacifism maintain that\nkilling is never permitted, even the killing of enemy soldiers. They\nmay also claim that the death penalty is wrong; and they may deny that\nkilling in self-defense is ever justifiable. Opponents of war may also\ndeny that international aggression is punishable by death.\n\nA more subtle argument along these lines will claim that it is wrong\nto kill enemy combatants because enemy combatants are occasionally (or\nusually\u2014depending on the strength of this particular claim) not\nresponsible for their participation in war. This is especially true of\nconscript armies who are forced to fight. A pacifist might want to\nmake an exception for killing soldiers who have malicious intent; but\nthey may argue that it is immoral to kill soldiers who are forced to\nfight.\n4.2 Killing Noncombatants\n\nAlthough some maximal versions of deontological pacifism will claim\nthat it is wrong even to kill combatants in war, other versions will\nargue that war is wrong primarily because of the risk to\nnoncombatants. A cherished principle of the just war tradition is the\nidea of noncombatant immunity. This idea holds that those not actually\nengaged in the fighting should not be put at risk and should not be\ndeliberately targeted. This idea is often connected to the idea that\nthe innocent should not be killed. Noncombatants are presumed to be\ninnocent and thus immune from being killed. There is an open question\nas to whether all noncombatants are really innocent. But the just war\ntradition stipulates that noncombatants should be immune from\nintentional harm. A version of pacifism can thus be derived from this\nprinciple of the just war tradition by arguing against wars that do in\nfact end up killing innocent noncombatants. Just war pacifists will\nargue that this is especially true given the nature of modern warfare,\nwhich includes the use of mechanized weapons, aerial bombardment, and\nweapons of mass destruction. Such weaponry does not adequately\ndiscriminate between combatants and noncombatants. Thus modern war\ncannot be just, according to the pacifist interpretation of the just\nwar tradition.\n\nThe just war tradition, however, allows that innocent noncombatants\nmay be killed according to the principle of double effect. This idea\nis derived in the Christian tradition from Aquinas, who holds that a\nsingle act may have two effects. Aquinas uses an example of killing in\nself-defense: the act has one effect of saving a life but another\neffect of killing the aggressor. Killing an aggressor in self-defense\nmay be permitted, if the death of the aggressor is not the primary\nintention of the defensive act. It is significant that Aquinas does\nnot expand this discussion to make it permissible to kill an innocent\nthird party. But the just war tradition has employed this idea in a\nway that makes it permissible to kill innocent third parties (i.e.,\nnoncombatants) in war, so long as the primary intention is to\naccomplish a legitimate war aim and so long as the killing of\ninnocents is merely a foreseen but unintended secondary effect.\nAbsolute pacifists will argue against this employment of the doctrine\nof double effect and will claim that the killing of the innocent in\nwar is always wrong, even if it is an unintended effect.\n\nIndeed, some pacifists may also claim that since we know that war will\nkill noncombatants, it is disingenuous to claim that the deaths of\ninnocent noncombatants are not intended. The pacifist may claim that\nthe real problem of war is that noncombatants are killed intentionally\nas a means of warfare. Although Anscombe argued against pacifism, she\nmade a similar argument in her criticism of the attacks on Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki, \u201cit is nonsense to pretend that you do not intend\nto do what is the means you take to your chosen end\u201d (1981a).\nAnscombe thought that war could be justified\u2014if it did not\ndirectly intend to kill noncombatants. And Anscombe thought that\npacifists were wrong to ignore the distinction between shedding\ninnocent blood and shedding blood in just warfare. But pacifists might\nargue in response that war is wrong because innocent noncombatants are\nkilled\u2014whether intentionally or not.\n5. Religious and Cultural Basis\n5.1 Religion and Virtue Ethics\n\nPacifism that is absolutist and deontological is often grounded in\nreligious belief. Christian philosopher Stanley Hauerwas has claimed\nthat pacifism is a theological position because it is as much about\neschatological faith as it is about ethics and politics (Hauerwas\n2006). A variety of religions have supported pacifist positions.\nHindus, Jains, and Buddhists share a concern for ahimsa or\nnonviolence as a basic moral virtue. Likewise, Christians also find a\ncommitment to nonviolence at the heart of their tradition. One reason\nthat absolutist and deontological pacifism appears to require a\nreligious foundation is that the commitment to peace can lead to\nsuffering in the \u2018real\u2019 world of political life. But for\nsome religious believers the world of political life is only an\napparent world and not the real world at all. In the Buddhist\ntradition, the world of dependent arising is a world of appearances in\nwhich suffering is ubiquitous. One of the ways to overcome this\nsuffering is to see through the veil of maya and the illusions of this\nworld. Ahimsa or nonviolence is a virtue that renounces the ubiquitous\nviolence of the \u2018real\u2019 world. In a different way, the\nChristian tradition holds that the \u2018city of God\u2019 or divine\nprovidence is a mysterious reality that is infinitely more important\nthan the reality of the \u2018city of Man.\u2019\n\nThe structure of this sort of religious belief is closely related to\nthe absolute, deontological, and transformational nature of religious\npacifism. In Christian pacifism, it is God\u2019s commandments as\narticulated by Jesus that necessitate a commitment to pacifism. Of\ncourse, this is a contentious point; and some deny that Christianity\nrequires pacifism (see Fiala 2007). But Christian pacifists maintain\nthat Christians should refuse to kill regardless of the consequences\nin the \u2018real\u2019 world. Related to this is the faith that God\nwill provide both the strength to endure suffering and a final reward\nfor those who remain committed to principles of nonviolence. Even\nthough pacifism may seem imprudent or even idiotic from the standpoint\nof consequentialism or political realism, these consequences have no\nlasting significance from the standpoint of Providence. Indeed,\nreligious pacifists are not averse to the pain that they might suffer\nas a result of their refusal to take part in violence because they\nbelieve that this suffering will be redeemed in the larger structure\nof divine justice.\n\nA further variety of religious pacifism is closely connected with the\nideas of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics emphasizes the cultivation of\nvirtues over the course of a lifetime. Virtue ethicists are reluctant\nto judge actions in isolation from the total context of an\nindividual\u2019s life. Religious pacifism has a virtue ethics\ncomponent when the commitment to peace is conceived as a lifelong\nproject of personal transformation. In the Christian tradition this is\nunderstood as a project in which human beings learn to imitate Jesus\nin order to become closer to God. The Christian model of virtue is\nJesus, and Jesus\u2019 practice of nonviolence culminated in his\ncrucifixion. Christian martyrs have looked to this paradigm for\nmillennia.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that virtue ethics need not be\nreduced to a merely religious idea: there are important non-religious\narticulations of virtue ethics. And there are authors who defend\nversions of pacifism based upon claims grounded in humanistic virtue\nethics. David K. Chan has argued, for example, that while virtuous\nindividuals would generally be averse to killing, they would not be\nabsolute pacifists (Chan 2017 and 2012). A different argument for\npacifism, based in virtue ethics, has been made by Trivigno (2013),\nwho argues that training soldiers to kill turns them into bad\npersons.\n\nA similar idea about the practical impact of violence or nonviolence\nis found in the Indian traditions. Gandhi\u2019s practice of\nself-renunciation (brahmacharya) including his vow of poverty\nand his fasts were closely tied to his commitment to ahimsa.\nFor Gandhi, nonviolence is part of a total practice of virtue. In the\nBuddhist tradition this is developed for example, in Thich Nhat\nHanh\u2019s (1987) idea of \u201cbeing peace.\u201d The virtue\napproach emphasizes that pacifism is a lifelong project that requires\ndiscipline and practice. This is true because we are not born\nvirtuous. Rather, we learn to cultivate the virtue of peacefulness by\ngradually learning habits that help us control and resist anger,\nhatred, pride, competitiveness and the other emotions that lead to\nviolence. In the Christian tradition this is linked to the idea of\noriginal sin: we are born in violence and have to learn to overcome\nviolence. Theological questions arise in Christianity about whether\nhuman beings can overcome violence by themselves or whether grace is\nneeded in order to cultivate the virtue of peace.\n\nIt is possible to develop a version of virtue-pacifism from a\nnon-religious standpoint. In the ancient world, some versions of\nStoicism and Epicureanism come close to this. Stoics, for example,\nemphasize the virtue of tranquility or undisturbedness. One attains\nthis state by learning proper discipline and by cultivating the other\nvirtues that are essential for reigning in hubris. Hubris is wanton\nviolence or pride run amok. Since Plato, the Greek tradition has\nclaimed that justice, courage, moderation, and wisdom were needed to\novercome hubris. It is conceivable that these virtues would conjoin in\na sort of peacefulness. Indeed, one can see the roots of nonviolent\nsocial protest in Socrates\u2019 nonresistance to the Athenian state.\nIt should be noted, however, that although Socrates refused to carry\nout unjust orders, he did serve the state in battle.\n\nA non-religious version of virtue-pacifism can be found in the ideas\nof 20th Century humanists such as William James. At the\nbeginning of the 20th Century, James acknowledged that war\nand military service did produce certain virtues, such as courage and\ndiscipline. But James hoped that there could be a non-military way of\nproducing these virtues. This was the basic idea behind his proposal\nfor a \u201cmoral equivalent to war,\u201d which was an attempt to\nfind a way to produce virtues without connecting them to militarism\n(James 1910).\n5.2 Diverse Religious and Cultural Sources\n\nThe general rejection of war has a long history that parallels the\njust war tradition and its idea that wars should be fought for the\nsake of peace and justice. In the West, pacifism and the just war\ntradition have roots in both Christian and non-Christian sources. For\nChristian thinkers, one of the primary problems is trying to reconcile\nthe pacific commandments of Jesus with the apparent moral necessity of\nusing war to defend the innocent. This problem is acute for Christians\nsince Jesus seems to advocate an ethic of nonviolence both in the\nSermon on the Mount and in his submission to violence, while Augustine\nand others use both Biblical sources (such as Paul\u2019s letter to\nthe Romans) and natural law to argue in favor of the just war idea. In\nthe European tradition, pacifism is an ideal that develops alongside\nof and in contrast to the just war tradition, with adherents of\npacifism including the Mennonites and Quakers, as well as Christian\nhumanists such as Erasmus.\n\nThe problem of justifying war is also found in Greek thinkers, such as\nPlato, who argued in the Laws that war should only be waged\nfor the sake of peace and that \u201cit is peace in which each of us\nshould spend most of his life and spend it best\u201d (803d). And in\nthe Crito, Socrates considers the problem of whether it is\never justified to return evil for evil. Socrates begins with the\nassumption that we must do no harm; and he and Crito agree at one\npoint that one \u201cought not retaliate or render evil for evil to\nanyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him\u201d (49d). It\nseems that this idea is behind Socrates decision to remain in prison\nand allow himself to be executed.\n\nPacifism shows up in non-European traditions as well. Jains,\nBuddhists, and others in the Indian tradition share a commitment to\nahimsa or nonviolence as a cardinal virtue (see Howard 2017).\nThe ideal in these traditions is a sort of selflessness in which,\nthrough the dissolution of the self, a larger truth emerges. For\nBuddhists this is based upon the idea of nonattachment: war, violence,\nanger, and hatred result from our attachment to material things.\nAhimsa is also linked to the idea that all sentient beings are\ninterdependent. Thus nonviolence is extended toward a rejection of\nviolence toward sentient beings in general and a commitment to\nvegetarianism. Mohandas Gandhi is perhaps the most famous adherent of\nahimsa of the last century. Gandhi based his commitment to\nnonviolence on a spiritual foundation that emphasized\nself-renunciation (brahmacharya) and the positive action of\nthe force of love or force of truth that he called\nsatyagraha.\n\nWhile Indian traditions are often cited as sources of pacifism, it is\nalso important to note that pacifism and nonviolence can be found in\nIslamic traditions and in African religious and philosophical\ntraditions. Ramin Jahanbegloo (2017) argues, for example, that Islam\n(whose root is salaam, which means peace) includes a rich\nconversation about violence and peace. In the South Asian context of\nthe 20th Century, Muslims such as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Khan\nAbdul Ghaffar Khan joined Gandhi in affirming the power of\nnonviolence. There has been discussion among some Western politicians\nand journalists in the past couple of decades about whether there is\nsomething inherently violent about Islam and its notion of\njihad. But scholars such as Cole (2021) and Shadi (2017) show\nthat the diverse Muslim tradition includes a number of pacifist\nthinkers. And Alvi (2021) explains that a notion of nonviolent\njihad can be found in Islam in relation to the idea of jihad as\nspiritual struggle, and with regard to the role of nonviolent activism\nin Islamic contexts.\n\nA similar kind of diversity can be found across the world\u2019s\ntraditions. This includes pacifist ideas found in a variety of\nindigenous traditions. And often this involves a kind of syncretism\nthat results from colonialism. One example in North America is worth\nnoting: the case of Papunhank, a native American convert to Quaker\nreligion in Pennsylvania during colonial times, who has been cited as\na \u201cpacifist prophet\u201d (see Pointer 2020). In African thought this\nsyncretism also includes the influence of Christianity and Islam. For\nexample, the Jahkanke pacifists of West Africa were an Islamic sect\n(see Sanneh 2016). And it is important to note that Gandhi was also at\nwork in South Africa, where Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu\nare now seen as important figures in the history of nonviolence. While\nTutu works in the Christian tradition, we also see an emphasis on\nnonviolence in indigenous African contexts. Gail Presbey has traced\nout numerous examples of this, including the way that nonviolence is\nrelated to concepts such as ubuntu (Presbey 2017).\n\nIt is to note that the distinction between European and non-European\ntraditions breaks down in the 20th Century: Gandhi was\ninspired by Thoreau and by Tolstoy; and Gandhi in turn inspired\nWestern pacifists such as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and\nMartin Luther King Jr. Gandhi and King both claim that one of the most\nimportant ideas underlying this sort of pacifism is love, especially\nthe disinterested brotherly love that is described in the Greek New\nTestament using the word agape. King explains it this way:\n\u201cIn the final analysis, agape means recognition of the fact that\nall life is interrelated. All humanity is involved in a single\nprocess, and all men are brothers. To the degree that I harm my\nbrother, no matter what he is doing to me, to that extent I am harming\nmyself\u201d (King 1986, 20) This idea represents the extension of\nChristian pacifism in light of Gandhian principles.\n\nFurther discussions should more systematically consider how such ideas\nhave spread to Latin America, East Asia, and the Muslim world, as well\nas the ways that nonviolence shows up in the religious and\nphilosophical traditions of the rest of the world. Research projects\nin pacifism and peace studies should continue to explore ideas found\nin the variety of world traditions including Taoism, African thought,\nand indigenous American philosophies.\n6. Objections to Pacifism and Possible Replies\n\nHere we will summarize briefly several objections to pacifism and\npacifist replies to these objections. These objections and replies\nwill, of course, vary according to the different sorts of pacifism\nbeing attacked or defended.\n6.1 Pacifism is for Cowards, Free Riders, Traitors, and Other Vicious Persons\n\nObjection: This objection holds that the reason\npacifists advocate nonviolence is that they are afraid of suffering\nfrom violence; or that they are too lazy or self-interested to take up\narms to fight. This objection focuses on the motivation and psychology\nof pacifists and accuses pacifists of the vice of cowardice. Moreover,\nsuch an objection may also argue that pacifists are egoists who are\ntoo selfish to do what is required to serve justice, protect the\ninnocent, and defend the nation. The free rider objection adds that\npacifists benefit from social goods that are produced through military\npower, while they contribute nothing substantial to the production of\nthese goods. This objection thus claims that pacifism is unjust since\npacifists share in social benefits, without also taking up the burdens\nand obligations that are tied to these benefits. Related to this is\nthe charge that pacifism is unpatriotic and even treasonous. The\nconcern here is that if pacifists are unwilling to fight to defend the\nnation, then they effectively betray the nation and help the enemy. As\nJan Narveson once put this, pacifists have \u201ctoo many\nfriends\u201d (Narveson 2003; also Narveson 2017) since they are\nunwilling to take up arms against their enemies. A more forceful ad\nhominem argument against pacifism can be found in Ward\nChurchill\u2019s idea that pacifism is a pathology of the privileged,\na point that has been reiterated by Derek Jensen. This objection holds\nthat it is easy for those who are not oppressed to advocate\nnonviolence and indeed, that the powerful can use the ideology of\npacifism as a tool with which to further oppress those who are\nunwilling to take up arms in defense of human rights. This idea can be\ntraced back to ideas found in Marcuse, who argued that the weaker\nparties in social conflict are forced by the stronger party to employ\nnonviolence and thus that resort to nonviolence is both ineffective\nand an admission of weakness.\n\nReply: One way that a pacifist might reply to this\nobjection is to argue that pacifism results from noble motives and not\nvicious ones. To support this reply, pacifists might show examples of\nthe virtuous individuals who have advocated pacifism, while also\nemphasizing the ethical basis on which pacifism is grounded. Indeed,\npacifists can avoid the cowardice objection by stressing that\npacifists are willing to suffer violence even though they refuse to\nparticipate in it. With regard to the free rider problem, a principled\npacifist can argue that her moral principles require that she be a\npacifist and that these principles also require that she work to\ntransform society. Moreover, pacifists can engage in productive social\nendeavors that do not necessitate the use of violence or war. This\nsort of compromise occurs when military states find ways to employ the\ntalents of conscientious objectors. Pacifists who refuse to fight can\nvolunteer their talents and energies in nonviolent activities that\nsupport the common good. With regard to the accusation of treason, a\npacifist might claim that there are higher goods than the state.\nIndeed some pacifists\u2014such as Tolstoy or Hauerwas\u2014are also\nanarchists who claim that Christian faith requires that one overcome\none\u2019s attachment to the state as well as one\u2019s hatred of\nenemies. A similar argument can be made against Churchill\u2019s\n\u201cpacifism as pathology\u201d objection, with principled\npacifists claiming that nonviolence is a moral requirement that\ntranscends class and national ideology. Finally, a consequentialist\npacifist can reply that she is concerned with the long-term interests\nof the community and not with the short-term question of winning a war\nor staging a revolution. While violence may create short term\nbenefits, the long term project of creating a stable peace will\nrequire nonviolent means and projects focused on reconciliation and\nrestorative justice. Contra the Churchill/Jensen objection, pacifists\nwill emphasize the moral and political importance of unifying means\nand end. And, as Jos\u00e9-Antonio Orosco has argued, nonviolent\nactivism can be an effective means of countering oppression (Orosco\n2017).\n6.2 Pacifists are Wrong to Aspire for the Purity of \u201cClean Hands\u201d; and Pacifism is Based on Bad Theology\n\nObjection: The clean hands objection holds that\npacifists are so committed to keeping their hands clean that they fail\nto act on other requirements of life. The clean hands objection holds\nthat pacifists are disconnected from the world of concrete human\nreality. As Anscombe puts this in her critique of pacifism, the\npacifist holds \u201cwithdrawal from the world as man\u2019s only\nsalvation\u201d (Anscombe 1981a, 52). This is tied to a theological\nobjection that holds that pacifists incorrectly believe that they can\novercome the limits of human nature. A version of this objection that\nis often directed against Christian pacifism holds that war will\nremain necessary because of the fallen and sinful nature of human\nbeings. This objection also reminds Christian pacifists that there is\nexplicit advocacy for war in the Old Testament and that Paul\u2019s\nletter to the Romans allows the sovereign to use the sword to\nexecute God\u2019s wrath. The objection holds that since we are not\nperfect, we must employ the imperfect means of war and violence to\nattain moral ends. From this standpoint, defenders of the idea of a\njust war argue that love of the neighbor and the need for a just\nsocial order will occasionally necessitate just wars.\n\nReply: Pacifists might reply to this sort of\nobjection by delving deeper into the requirements of both religious\nfaith and ethics. This objection is tied to a much larger problem of\ncoordinating the demands of ordinary political life with the\nrequirements of morality and religion. Christian pacifists will reply\nto the \u201cbad theology\u201d objection by focusing on the message\nof Jesus in the Gospels; and they will argue, as John Howard Yoder\ndoes, that just war theory is a later development of a lapsed sort of\n\u201cConstantinian\u201d (or Augustinian) Christianity. Moreover,\nChristian pacifists will argue that pacifism is part of a religious\nworldview that looks beyond a materialistic defense of the finite\ngoods of this world. For religiously oriented pacifists in many\ntraditions, a commitment to nonviolence is tied to the attempt to see\nthrough the vanity of temporal things. Nonreligious pacifists will\nreply to this objection by clarifying the importance of clean hands in\nmorality. Absolutists will claim that we have an obligation to uphold\nthe requirements of morality and keep our hands as clean as possible.\nThey will also claim that the world would be a better place if\neveryone took this obligation seriously and refused to compromise with\nevil.\n6.3 Pacifism is Self-contradictory, Unjust, and Not Effective\n\nObjection: This objection claims that pacifism\nresults in a performative contradiction because an absolute pacifist\nwho is unwilling to defend himself simply ends up dead. A more subtle\nversion of this argument has been articulated by Jan Narveson\n(Narveson 1965) who argued that pacifism involves an internal\ncontradiction that is related to the idea of justice and human rights.\nPacifists are unwilling to use violence to defend against aggression\nbecause they respect life or respect persons. But a contradiction\noccurs when the pacifist who claims that life is an absolute good is\nunwilling to take the necessary steps to defend lives that are\nthreatened by aggression. This objection shares something with those\ndefenders of the just war idea who, like George Weigel, are inspired\nby the Augustinian ideal of using war to defend a tranquil and just\nsocial order. The objection holds that it is immoral to avoid war,\nwhen war could be used to defend the innocent, protect sovereignty,\nand uphold a just international order. This objection can be applied\nboth to defensive wars, in which the state has an obligation to\nprotect its own citizens, and to wars of humanitarian intervention, in\nwhich military power is used to defend the human rights and to\nestablish domestic tranquility and social order in pursuit of peace.\nRelated to this is the claim that nonviolent means of producing social\nchange are ineffective. Critics will claim, for example, that although\nthere appear to be cases of successful nonviolent action in India or\nin the American civil rights movements, these movements were\nsuccessful because of unique set of historical circumstances. Critics\nwill argue that Gandhi\u2019s success was made possible by British\nexhaustion from the World Wars; and they will argue that the success\nof Martin Luther King Jr. was made possible by the threat of violence\nfrom radicals such as the Black Panthers. Moreover, critics will argue\nthat Gandhi and King were successful because their opponents were for\nthe most part sympathetic to their cause from the beginning. But such\ncritics will argue that non-violence will simply not work against\nNazis or terrorists; and that those who think so are dangerously\ndeluded. President Barack Obama articulated this sort of objection to\npacifism in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech (Obama 2009).\nObama expressed respect for pacifists such as Gandhi and King. He\nsaid, \u201cthere is nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naive in\nthe creed and lives of Gandhi and King.\u201d But he claimed that a\nhead of state cannot be guided by pacifism. And he concluded: \u201cA\nnonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler\u2019s armies.\nNegotiations cannot convince al-Qaeda\u2019s leaders to lay down\ntheir arms.\u201d A similar argument about the efficacy of violence\nhas been made by defenders of insurrectionary violence such as\nMarcuse, Fanon, and Sartre.\n\nReply: One way that a pacifist may reply to this\nobjection is to focus on pacifism as a skeptical political stance\nabout war. Some political pacifists do allow for personal self-defense\nand defense of loved-ones while remaining skeptical of war as a social\nmovement. Another way that a pacifist may reply is to focus on\nconsequences and argue that war produces more negative consequences\nthan nonviolence. Against Narveson, the pacifist might argue that\npacifism is no more contradictory than the idea that we might kill in\norder to defend life. Deontological pacifists will also reply that\nwhile they do value a just and tranquil social order, and may even be\nwilling to die in defense of such as just order, their basic\nprinciples prohibit them from killing in its defense. A pacifist might\nfurther reply to this objection by arguing that the idea that war can\nbe used to defend the innocent is also imprudent and unwise. Pacifists\nwill argue that nonviolent means of defending the just political order\nare the best means to be employed in practice because they remain\nconsistent with the ideals of justice and order that are to be\ndefended. This claim about the unity of means and ends can be used to\nargue against the Fanon/Marcuse justification of violence in\ninsurrection by noting a contradiction in revolutionaries using\nviolence to oppose the violence of oppressive states. A pacifist might\nadd that history shows that violent revolution often either escalates\nor provokes more oppression. With regard to humanitarian intervention,\nsome deontological pacifists will worry that interventions by\noutsiders will run counter to the national right to\nself-determination. And more prudentially minded pacifists will worry\nthat humanitarian intervention will produce resistance and an\nescalation of violence that will undermine the long-term goals of\npolitical stabilization, justice, and reconciliation. Finally, the\npacifist might also appeal to the tragic element in human life: that\nwe often have to make tragic choices in which there is no genuinely\ngood alternative. When confronted with such tragic conflicts, the\npacifist will argue that we should err on the side of peace and take\ncare that we do no harm. The examples of King and Gandhi may in fact\nrequire careful historical analysis; and different historical\ncircumstances will require different sorts of nonviolent action. But,\nfor the pacifist, history shows us the horror of war; and the success\nof Gandhi and King reminds us that there is an alternative. Finally, a\npacifist might also point out that the long term goal of a\ntransformation beyond war is shared by a variety of people, including\nthose who are reluctant to call themselves pacifists. As Obama pointed\nout in his Nobel Peace Prize speech, even if war may be necessary, it\nis also \u201cat some level an expression of human folly.\u201d\nPacifists usually deny that war is necessary. But they agree that war\nis usually an expression of human folly.\n",
