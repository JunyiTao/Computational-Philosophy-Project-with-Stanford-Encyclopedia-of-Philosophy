    "main_text": "Crito\n12. Crito\n\nIn the Crito Socrates states the doctrines most important to\nhis conception of the ethical life. He will give up his life rather\nthan compromise his ethics. His peers would all agree that life is not\nworth living with a badly deformed body; they should agree that life\nis even less worth living with the deformation of something more\nimportant than the body\u2014in other dialogues identified as the\nsoul. Acting wrongly causes serious injury to the soul. That is why\nSocrates believes we must strive to avoid wrongdoing at all costs.\n\nCrito, a wealthy Athenian friend of Socrates, has bribed the jailers\nand prepared means for Socrates to escape from Athens, but Socrates\nrefuses on the grounds that to do so would be to damage the laws\nwrongfully, and this violates his\n bedrock principle\n that one must never do wrong, even in return for a wrong. When Crito\nappeals to popular opinion on the matter, Socrates replies that the\nonly authority he would accept on the matter would be that of someone\nwho is expert on the matter at hand, which is how doing right and\ndoing wrong affect the most important part of a person. This is\nanalogous to how health and disease affect the body. Socrates is\nlooking for an expert who is analogous to a doctor, whose specialty is\nmoral health and corruption. In the absence of such an expert,\nhowever, he must make up his own mind.\n\nHis first conclusion is that nothing matters other than whether their\nactions would be just or unjust, right or wrong.\n(\u201cJustice\u201d and \u201cinjustice\u201d (dike and\nadikia) in this context cover all other-regarding ethical\nmatters, and may be translated \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201cwrong.\u201d) Socrates then goes on to argue that they would\ndo wrong if they followed Crito\u2019s plan. His argument uses his\nold method of accepting the reasoning (logos) that seems best\nto him as he reasons about it (46b). The bedrock principle has guided\nhis life so far, and it would be absurd to give it up now merely\nbecause his circumstances have changed (46b, 49ab).\n\nHis second conclusion is that they would do wrong if they followed\nCrito\u2019s plan. The argument leads to a question Crito cannot\nanswer: One should abide by one\u2019s agreements provided they are\njust; would I be abiding by my agreement if I escaped without\npersuading the city (49e\u201350a)?\n\nBecause Crito cannot answer, Socrates personifies the laws and\nimagines their response, on behalf of his obligation to them. (Here as\nelsewhere, with the exception of the Apology, Socrates avoids\ngiving an extensive speech in his own persona.) The argument the laws\ngive is elaborate, and appeals mainly to two points: an agreement they\nallege Socrates made to obey them by choosing to live in Athens, and\nthe benefits they claim Socrates has received from them, which place\nSocrates under a stronger obligation to the laws than he has to his\nparents. Neither Crito nor Socrates can reply to the arguments given\nby the laws, and conclusion of the laws is allowed to stand.\n\nThe conclusion of these personified laws\u2014that one must obey the\ncity in all things (51bc)\u2014seems to conflict with a memorable\ntext in the Apology, as Grote first pointed out; there\nSocrates promises to disobey the court if it should let him off on the\ncondition that he give up his mission in Athens (29d). Scholarly\nopinions differ over how to reconcile these texts.\n",
