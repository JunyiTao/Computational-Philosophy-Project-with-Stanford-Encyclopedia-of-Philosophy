    "main_text": "The Argument From Skepticism || Tracking and Skepticism\n5.2 Tracking and Skepticism\n\nAccording to Dretske and Nozick, skepticism is appealing because\nskeptics are partially right. They are correct when they say that we\ndo not know that skeptical hypotheses fail to hold. For I do not track\nnot-biv: if biv were true, I would still\nhave the experiences that lead me to believe that biv is\nfalse. Something similar can be said about antiskepticism:\nantiskeptics are correct when they say we know all sorts of\ncommonsense claims that entail the falsity of skeptical hypotheses.\nHaving gotten this far, however, skeptics appeal to K, and argue that\nsince I would know not-biv if I knew h, then I must\nnot know h after all, while Moore-style antiskeptics appeal\nto K in order to conclude that I do know not-biv. But\nthis is precisely where skeptics and antiskeptics alike go wrong, for\nK is false. Consider the position skeptics are in. Having\naccepted the tracking view\u2014as they do when they deny that we\nknow skeptical hypotheses are false\u2014skeptics cannot appeal to\nthe principle of closure, which is false on the tracking theory. We\ntrack (hence know) the truth of ordinary knowledge claims yet fail to\ntrack (or know) the truth of things that follow, such as that\nincompatible skeptical hypotheses are false.\n\nOne shortcoming of this story is that it cannot come to terms with all\ntypes of skepticism. There are two main forms of skepticism (and\nvarious sub-categories): regress (or Pyrrhonian) skepticism, and\nindiscernability (Cartesian) skepticism. At best, Dretske and Nozick\nhave provided a way of dealing with the latter.\n\nAnother worry about Dretske\u2019s and Nozick\u2019s response to Cartesian\nskepticism is that it forces us to give up K (as well as\nGK, and closure across instantiation and simplification). Given\nthe intuitive appeal of these principles, some theorists have looked\nfor alternative ways of explaining skepticism, which they then offer\nas superior in part on the grounds that they do no violence to\nK. Consider two possibilities, one offered by advocates of the\nsafe indication theory, and one by contextualists.\n",
