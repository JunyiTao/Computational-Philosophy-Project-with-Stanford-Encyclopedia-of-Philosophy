    "main_text": "She Came to Stay: Freedom and Violence\n3. She Came to Stay: Freedom and Violence\n\nThough Beauvoir\u2019s first philosophical essay was Pyrrhus and\nCin\u00e9as (1944) many of her interpreters identify She\nCame to Stay (1943) as her inaugural philosophical foray. It is a\nclear example of what Beauvoir calls the metaphysical novel. The\nletters between Sartre and Beauvoir and Beauvoir\u2019s diaries of\nthat period (published in the 1980s), show that both Beauvoir and\nSartre were concerned with the question of the other, the issue of bad\nfaith and the dynamics of desire. They were also examining the\nrelationship and tensions between our singular existential status and\nthe social conditions within which our singularity is lived. She\nCame to Stay is packed with philosophical\nreflections\u2014reflections on our relationship to time, to each\nother, to ourselves. These reflections are never, however, presented\nin systematic arguments or brought to closure. They are lived in the\nconcrete, ambiguously triangulated lives of Pierre, Xavi\u00e8re and\nFran\u00e7oise. Opening with a quote from Hegel, \u201cEach\nconscience seeks the death of the other\u201d, and ending with\nFran\u00e7oise\u2019s murder of Xavi\u00e8re, which Beauvoir\nnarrates as an act in which Fran\u00e7oise confronts her solitude\nand announces her freedom, the novel does not necessarily confirm\nHegel\u2019s claim. The point of the murder was not to eliminate the\nother per se but to destroy a particular other, Xavi\u00e8re, who\nwas the other who threatened to leave Fran\u00e7oise without the\nother she loved, Pierre. Here, existential ambiguity trumps Hegelian\nclarity. The issues raised in this first novel, including the\nambiguity regarding the responsibilities and limits of freedom, the\nlegitimacy of violence, the tension between our experience of\nourselves as simultaneously solitary and intertwined with others, the\ntemptations of bad faith and the examination of the existentially\nfaithful relationship to time, will pervade Beauvoir\u2019s\nsubsequent reflections.\n",
