The Place of Beneficence in the History of Ethical Theory\n\n\nThe history of ethical theory shows that there are many ways to\nthink about beneficence and benevolence. Several landmark ethical\ntheories have embraced these moral notions as central categories, while\nproposing strikingly different conceptual and moral analyses. Prime\nexamples are found in the moral-sentiment theory of David Hume, where\nbenevolence is the central \u201cprinciple\u201d of human nature in\nhis moral psychology, and in utilitarian theories such as John Stuart\nMill\u2019s, where the principle of utility is itself a strong and\nvery demanding normative principle of beneficence. In these writers\nbeneficence is close to the essence of morality. Other writers,\nincluding Kant, have given less ascendency to beneficence, but still\ngive it a central place in morality.\n",
