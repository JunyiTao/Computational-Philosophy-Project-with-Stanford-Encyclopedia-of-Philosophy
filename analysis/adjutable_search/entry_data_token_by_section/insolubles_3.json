    "main_text": "Origins of the Medieval Discussion || Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations\n1.3 Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations\n\nBy contrast with these passages, none of which was cited in the\ninsolubilia-literature, there is a text from\nAristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations 25, [A-SR]:\n180a27\u2013b7, that, almost from the very beginning of the\ninsolubilia-literature to the end of the Middle Ages, served\nas the framework for discussing insolubles. It occurs in\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the fallacy of confusing things said\n\u201cin a certain respect\u201d (secundum quid) with\nthings said \u201cabsolutely\u201d or \u201cwithout\nqualification\u201d (simpliciter). In this context,\nAristotle considers someone who takes an oath that he will become an\noath-breaker, and then does so. Absolutely or without qualification,\nAristotle says, such a man is an oath-breaker, even though with\nrespect to the particular oath to become an oath-breaker he\nis an oath-keeper. Then Aristotle adds the intriguing remark,\n\u201cThe argument is similar too concerning the same man\u2019s\nlying and speaking the truth at the same time\u201d ([A-SR]:\n180b2\u20133). It was this sentence that many medieval authors took\nto be a reference to the Liar Paradox, which therefore, on the\nauthority of Aristotle, could be solved as a fallacy secundum quid\net simpliciter.\n\nThe widespread appeal to this passage throughout the history of the\ninsolubilia-literature indicates that the text did play some\nrole in prompting medieval interest in insolubles. This suggestion is\nreinforced by the fact that the earliest known medieval statement of\nthe Liar occurs in 1132, around the time the Sophistical\nRefutations first began to circulate in Western Europe in Latin\ntranslation (see\n Section 2\n below).\n\nNevertheless, it is not immediately obvious how Aristotle\u2019s\nremarks can be made to fit the Liar Paradox. The oath-breaker, as the\nexample was generally interpreted, takes two oaths: one,\nwhich he keeps, that he will break his oath, and a second (it does not\nmatter what it is) that he breaks, thereby fulfilling the first oath.\nThe man is an oath-breaker and an oath-fulfiller, but with respect to\ndifferent oaths; by breaking his second oath, rendering it\nfalse, he fulfills the first oath, making it true. However, it is\npossible to interpret the passage as referring to a single oath, when\nthe oath is broken at the same time as it is made. Seen that way, it\nconnects the Liar paradox with the fallacy secundum quid et\n simpliciter.[6]\n\nIn short, it seems clear that the Sophistical Refutations was\ninstrumental in prompting medieval interest in insolubles. But more\nmust have been involved too. Martin (1993) suggests a connection with\ntheories of obligations (cf.\n Section 3.3\n below). Before medieval logicians could formulate genuine Liar-type\nparadoxes, they first had to go well beyond anything found in\nAristotle\u2019s text. At present we cannot say whether they did this\non the basis of some still unidentified ancient source or whether it\nwas through their own intellectual power and logical insight.\n",
