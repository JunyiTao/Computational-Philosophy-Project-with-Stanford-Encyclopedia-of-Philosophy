    "main_text": "The impact of information technology on privacy || Mobile devices\n2.5 Mobile devices\n\nAs users increasingly own networked devices such as smart phones,\nmobile devices collect and send more and more data. These devices\ntypically contain a range of data-generating sensors, including GPS\n(location), movement sensors, and cameras, and may transmit the\nresulting data via the Internet or other networks. One particular\nexample concerns location data. Many mobile devices have a GPS sensor\nthat registers the user\u2019s location, but even without a GPS sensor,\napproximate locations can be derived, for example by monitoring the\navailable wireless networks. As location data links the online world\nto the user\u2019s physical environment, with the potential of physical\nharm (stalking, burglary during holidays, etc.), such data are often\nconsidered particularly sensitive.\n\nMany of these devices also contain cameras which, when applications\nhave access, can be used to take pictures. These can be considered\nsensors as well, and the data they generate may be particularly\nprivate. For sensors like cameras, it is assumed that the user is\naware when they are activated, and privacy depends on such knowledge.\nFor webcams, a light typically indicates whether the camera is on, but\nthis light may be manipulated by malicious software. In general,\n\u201creconfigurable technology\u201d (Dechesne, Warnier, & van\nden Hoven 2011) that handles personal data raises the question of user\nknowledge of the configuration.\n",
