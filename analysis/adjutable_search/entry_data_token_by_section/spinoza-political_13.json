    "main_text": "The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus || Social Contract in the TTP\n3.6 Social Contract in the TTP\n\n\nA good deal of scholarly attention has been placed on Spinoza\u2019s\naccount of the social contract in the TTP. Spinoza introduces the\ncontract in Chapter 16, when considering how people escape the\npre-civil condition. Here he claims that \u201c[men] had to make a\nfirm decision, and reach agreement, to decide everything by the sole\ndictate of reason\u201d (TTP 16, 198), which requires, as he later makes\nclear, that each transfers one\u2019s right to determine how to live and\ndefend himself to the sovereign (TTP 16, 199\u2013200);\ncf. EIVP37S2). He also cites the establishment of the Hebrew\nstate, with Moses as the absolute sovereign, as an historical example\nof a social contract (TTP 19, 240). The social contract seems to confer\nnearly boundless authority on the sovereign. So long as we are\nrational, \u201cwe are obliged to carry out absolutely all commands\nof the sovereign power, however absurd they may be\u201d (TTP 16,\n200).\n\n\nHowever, if Spinoza really relies upon the social contract as a\nsource of legitimacy, several problems arise. First of all, it seems\nunlikely that such a contract could ever have been formed, since the\nlegitimating strength of a social contract depends on farsighted\nrationality that Spinoza clearly thinks most people lack (see Den Uyl\n1983).\n\n\nBut even if such a contract were possible, a much greater problem\nremains for Spinoza. How can we take seriously a legitimacy-conferring\ncontract without violating the naturalism that is at the core of\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics? What is this right that is surrendered or\ntransferred? And how can one really transfer one\u2019s right, given\nthe coextensivity of right and power? Spinoza\u2019s\nnaturalistic, utility-based account of obligation (see 2.2, above) also seems to preclude the possibility of a binding social contract.\n\n\nSome commentators take these problems with Spinoza\u2019s social\ncontract to be insurmountable, and for this reason they regard him as\ncoming to his senses when he abandons the contract in the TP (Wernham\n1958, 25\u201327). Others have tried to reinterpret the contract in a way\nthat is makes it consistent with his naturalism. For instance, Barbone\nand Rice distinguish between two concepts that have been rendered in\nEnglish as \u201cpower.\u201d On the one hand there is\npotentia, which is the power that is essential to the\nindividual (Barbone and Rice 2000, 17). This power in inalienable. What\nis transferable is one\u2019s potestas, i.e. one\u2019s\nauthority (Barbone and Rice 2000, 17) or coercive power (Blom 1995,\n211).\n\n\nWhile this interpretation has the virtue of cohering with\nSpinoza\u2019s claim that he \u201calways preserve[s] the natural\nright in its entirety\u201d (Epistle 50), since one\u2019s right, or\npotentia, always remains intact, it leaves unexplained how\npotestas, which Barbone and Rice describe as a\n\u201csuper-added\u201d capacity, fits into the natural order. What\ncan it mean to possess, transfer, or renounce one\u2019s\npotestas? And how can transferring or revoking it result in an\nobligation, given Spinoza\u2019s utility-based account of\nobligation?\n\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand what it means to possess or give up one\npotestas is in psychological terms. Curley suggests this when\nhe looks to Hobbes\u2019 claim in Behemoth that the\n\u201cthe power of the mighty hath no foundation but in the opinion\nand belief of the people\u201d (EW VI, 184, 237\u2014cited in Curley\n1996, 326) as a way of understanding Spinoza\u2019s conception of\nsovereign formation. One could also cite Hobbes\u2019 famous claim in\nLeviathan that \u201creputation of power is power\u201d (Ch.\n10) as an expression of the same point. These passages can be\nunderstood as supporting the view that power is not transferred by way\nof a speech act, but rather by standing in the psychological thrall of\nthe sovereign. Sovereignty is the product of psychological deference\nrather than the formal transference of rights or titles. \n\n\nSome evidence in support of this psychological interpretation comes in\nTTP 17, where Spinoza claims that sovereign power or authority derives\nfrom the will of its subjects to obey (TTP 17, 209\u201310; cf. TP\n2/9\u201310). There are places in the text, however, when Spinoza\nseems to imply that we have obligations to the sovereign irrespective\nof our psychological or motivational state. In some of these\ninstances, a careful reading reveals that nothing of the sort is\nimplied. For instance, his claim that \u201cwe are obliged to carry\nabsolutely all the commands of the sovereign power, however absurd\nthey may be\u201d (TTP 16, 200) is contingent on our behaving rationally\nand wanting to avoid being regarded as enemies of the state. Still,\nthere are other places when he does imply that de facto\nobedience is neither necessary nor sufficient for establishing the\nlegitimacy of a civil body. For instance, he claims that the sovereign\nalone has right over religious matters such as interpreting Scripture,\nexcommunicating heretics, and making provisions for the poor (TTP 19, 239\n- 40), despite the fact that the church had, in fact, been exercising\npower in these matters. But this too can be reconciled with Spinoza\u2019s\nnaturalism, provided that we understand that the power or authority of\nclerics devolves upon them from the power or authority of the\nsovereign.\n",
