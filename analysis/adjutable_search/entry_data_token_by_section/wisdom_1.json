    "main_text": "Wisdom as Epistemic Accuracy\n2. Wisdom as Epistemic Accuracy\n\n \nSocrates can be interpreted as providing an epistemic accuracy, rather\nthan an epistemic humility, theory of wisdom. The poets, politicians,\nand craftsmen all believe they have knowledge about topics on which\nthey are considerably ignorant. Socrates, one might argue, believes he\nhas knowledge when, and only when, he really does have knowledge.\nPerhaps wise people restrict their confidence to propositions for\nwhich they have knowledge or, at least, to propositions for which they\nhave excellent justification.  Perhaps Socrates is better interpreted\nas having held an Epistemic Accuracy Theory such as:\n\nEpistemic Accuracy Theory 1 (EA1):\nS is wise iff for all p, (S believes\n S knows\np iff S knows p.)\n\n\nAccording to (EA1), a wise person is accurate about what she knows and\nwhat she does not know. If she really knows p, she believes she knows\np. And, if she believes she knows p, then she really does know\np. (EA1) is consistent with the idea that Socrates accepts that he is\nwise and with the idea that Socrates does have some knowledge. (EA1)\nis a plausible interpretation of the view Socrates endorses, but it is\nnot a plausible answer in the search for an understanding of\nwisdom. Wise people can make mistakes about what they know. Socrates,\nMaimonides, King Solomon, Einstein, Goethe, Gandhi, and every other\ncandidate for the honor of wisdom have held false beliefs about what\nthey did and did not know. It is easy to imagine a wise person being\njustified in believing she possesses knowledge about some claim, and\nalso easy to imagine that she could be shown to be mistaken, perhaps\nlong after her death. If (EA1) is true, then just because a person\nbelieves she has knowledge when she does not, she is not wise. That\nseems wrong.  It is hard to imagine that anyone at all is, or ever has\nbeen, wise if (EA1) is correct. \n\n \nWe could revise the Epistemic Accuracy Theory to get around this\nproblem. We might only require that a wise person\u2019s belief is\nhighly justified when she believes she has knowledge. \nThat excuses people with bad epistemic luck.\n\nEpistemic Accuracy 2 (EA2): \nS is wise iff for all p, (S believes\n S knows\np iff S\u2019s belief in p is highly\njustified.)\n\n\n(EA2) gets around the problem with (EA1). The Socratic Method\nchallenges one to produce reasons for one\u2019s view. When\nSocrates\u2019 interlocutor is left dumbfounded, or reduced to\nabsurdity, Socrates rests his case. One might argue that through\nhis questioning, Socrates reveals not that his opponents\nlack knowledge because their beliefs are false, but he\ndemonstrates that his opponents are not justified in holding the\nviews they profess to know. Since the craftsmen, poets, and\npoliticians questioned by Socrates all fail his interrogation,\nthey were shown, one might argue, to have claimed to have knowledge\nwhen their beliefs were not even justified. \n\n \nMany philosophers would hesitate to endorse this interpretation of\nwhat is going on in The Apology.  They would argue that a\nfailure to defend one\u2019s beliefs from Socrates\u2019 relentless questioning\ndoes not show that a person is not justified in believing a\nproposition. Many philosophers would argue that having very good\nevidence, or forming a belief via a reliable process, would be\nsufficient for justification.\n\nProving, or demonstrating to an interrogator, that one is justified is\nanother matter, and not necessary for simply being\njustified. Socrates, some might argue, shows only that the craftsmen,\npoets, and politicians cannot defend themselves from his questions. He\ndoes not show, one might argue, that the poets, politicians, and\ncraftsmen have unjustified beliefs.  Since we gain very little insight\ninto the details of the conversation in this dialogue, it would be\nunfair to dismiss this interpretation on these grounds. Perhaps\nSocrates did show, through his intense questioning, that the\ncraftsmen, poets, and politicians formed and held their beliefs\nwithout adequate evidence or formed and held them through unreliable\nbelief forming processes.  Socrates only reports that they did not\nknow all that they professed to know.  Since we do not get to witness\nthe actual questioning as we do in Plato\u2019s other dialogues, we should\nnot reject (EA2) as an interpretation of Socrates\u2019 view of wisdom\nin The Apology. \n\n \nRegardless of whether (EA2) is Socrates\u2019 view, there are problems for\n(EA2) as an account of what it means to be wise. Even if (EA2) is\nexactly what Socrates meant, some philosophers would argue that one\ncould be justified in believing a proposition, but not realize that\nshe is justified. If that is a possible situation for a wise person to\nbe in, then she might be justified, but fail to believe she has\nknowledge. Could a wise person be in such a situation, or is it\nnecessary that a wise person would always recognize the epistemic\nvalue of what he or she \n  believes?[1]\n  If this situation is impossible,\nthen this criticism could be avoided. There is no need to resolve this\nissue here because (EA1) and (EA2) fall prey to another, much less\nphilosophically thorny and controversial problem.\n\n \n(EA1) and (EA2) suffer from a similar, and very serious,\nproblem.  Imagine a person who has very little knowledge. Suppose\nfurther, that the few things she does know are of little or no importance. She\ncould be the sort of person that nobody would ever go to for\ninformation or advice. Such a person could be very cautious and believe that\nshe knows only what she actually knows. Although she would have\naccurate beliefs about what she does and does not know, she would not\nbe wise. This shows that (EA1) is flawed. As for (EA2), imagine that\nshe believes she knows only what she is actually justified in\nbelieving. She is still not wise. It should be noted, however, that\nalthough accuracy theories do not provide an adequate account of\nwisdom, they reveal an important insight. Perhaps a necessary\ncondition for being wise is that wise people think they have knowledge\nonly when their beliefs are highly justified. Or, even more simply,\nperhaps wise people have epistemically justified, or rational, beliefs. \n",
