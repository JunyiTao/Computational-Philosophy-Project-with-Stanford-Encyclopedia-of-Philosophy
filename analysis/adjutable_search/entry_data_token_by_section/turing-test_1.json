Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections\n\nAlthough Turing (1950) is pretty informal, and, in some ways rather\nidiosyncratic, there is much to be gained by considering the\ndiscussion that Turing gives of potential objections to his claim that\nmachines\u2014and, in particular, digital computers\u2014can\n\u201cthink\u201d. Turing gives the following labels to the\nobjections that he considers: (1) The Theological Objection; (2) The\n\u201cHeads in the Sand\u201d Objection; (3) The Mathematical\nObjection; (4) The Argument from Consciousness; (5) Arguments from\nVarious Disabilities; (6) Lady Lovelace\u2019s Objection; (7)\nArgument from Continuity of the Nervous System; (8) The Argument from\nInformality of Behavior; and (9) The Argument from Extra-Sensory\nPerception. We shall consider these objections in the corresponding\nsubsections below. (In some\u2014but not all\u2014cases, the\ncounter-arguments to these objections that we discuss are also\nprovided by Turing.)\n",
