    "main_text": "\n\nCausality is at the heart of Aristotle\u2019s scientific and\nphilosophical enterprise. Each Aristotelian science consists in the\ncausal investigation of a specific department of reality. If\nsuccessful, such an investigation results in causal knowledge; that\nis, knowledge of the relevant or appropriate causes. The emphasis on\nthe concept of cause explains why Aristotle developed a theory of\ncausality which is commonly known as the doctrine of the four causes.\nFor Aristotle, a firm grasp of what a cause is, and how many kinds of\ncauses there are, is essential for a successful investigation of the\nworld around us.\n\nAristotle is committed to a form of causal pluralism (Stein\n2011: 121\u2013147). For Aristotle, causes are spoken of in more than\none way, so more than one cause may be the non-coincidental cause of\nsomething (Phys. II 3, 195 a 3\u20135; Metaph. V 2,\n1013 b 4\u20136). Aristotle\u2019s considered view is that there are\nfour primary and irreducible kinds of causes (Metaph.. I 3,\n983 a 24\u2013983 b 1; cf.  APost, II 11, 94 a 20\u201324).\nThe focus of this entry is on the systematic interrelations among\nthem.\n",
