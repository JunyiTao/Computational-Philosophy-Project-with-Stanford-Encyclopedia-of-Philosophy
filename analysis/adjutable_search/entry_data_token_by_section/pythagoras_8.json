Aristotle emphasized his\nsuperhuman nature in the following ways: there was a story that\nPythagoras had a golden thigh (a sign of divinity); the Pythagoreans\ntaught that \u201cof rational beings, one sort is divine, one is\nhuman, and another such as Pythagoras\u201d (Iamblichus, VP\n31); Pythagoras was seen on the same day at the same time in both\nMetapontum and Croton; he killed a deadly snake by biting it; as he\nwas crossing a river it spoke to him (all citations are from\nAristotle, Fr. 191, unless otherwise noted). Aristotle reports that\nthe people of Croton called Pythagoras the \u201cHyperborean Apollo\u201d and\nIamblichus\u2019 report (VP 140) that a priest from the land of\nthe Hyperboreans, Abaris, visited Pythagoras and presented him with\nhis arrow, a token of power, may well also go back to Aristotle\n(Burkert 1972a, 143). Kingsley argues that the visit of Abaris is the\nkey to understanding the identity and significance of\nPythagoras. Abaris was a shaman from Mongolia (part of what the Greeks\ncalled Hyperborea), who recognized Pythagoras as an incarnation of\nApollo. The stillness of ecstacy practiced by Abaris and handed on to\nPythagoras is the foundation of all civilization. Abaris\u2019 visit to\nPythagoras thus beomces the central moment when civilizing power is\npassed from East to West (Kingsley 2010). \n\n\nWhether or not one accepts this account of Pythagoras and his relation\nto Abaris, there is a clear parallel for some of the remarkable\nabilities of Pythagoras in the later figure of Empedocles, who\npromises to teach his pupils to control the winds and bring the dead\nback to life (Fr. 111). There are recognizable traces of this\ntradition about Pythagoras even in the pre-Aristotelian evidence, and\nhis wonder-working clearly evoked diametrically opposed reactions.\nHeraclitus\u2019 description of Pythagoras as \u201cthe chief of the\ncharlatans\u201d (Fr. 81) and of his wisdom as \u201cfraudulent\nart\u201d (Fr. 129) is most easily understood as an unsympathetic\nreference to his miracles. Empedocles, on the other hand, is clearly\nsympathetic to Pythagoras, when he describes him as \u201c a man who\nknew remarkable things\u201d and who \u201cpossessed the greatest\nwealth of intelligence\u201d and again probably makes reference to\nhis wonder-working by calling him \u201caccomplished in all sorts of\nwise deeds\u201d(Fr. 129). In Herodotus\u2019 report, Zalmoxis,\nwhom some of the Greeks identified as the slave and pupil of\nPythagoras, tried to gain authority for his teachings about the fate\nof the soul by claiming to have journeyed to the next world\n(IV. 95). The skeptical tradition represented in Herodotus\u2019 report\ntreats this as a ruse on Zalmoxis\u2019 part; he had not journeyed to the\nnext world but had in reality hidden in an underground dwelling for\nthree years. Similarly Pythagoras may have claimed authority for his\nteachings concerning the fate of our soul on the basis of his\nremarkable abilities and experiences, and there is some evidence that\nhe too claimed to have journeyed to the underworld and that this\njourney may have been transferred from Pythagoras to Zalmoxis (Burkert\n1972a,154 ff.).\n",
