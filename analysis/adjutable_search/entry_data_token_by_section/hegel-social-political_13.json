    "main_text": "The State\n10. The State\n\nHegel\u2019s final section of \u201cEthical Life\u201d is the state.\nThe love for others based on feeling in the family and then on the\nsatisfaction of needs in civil society is transformed to a patriotic\nlove for fellow citizens in support of a shared community, embodied by\nthe modern state (see PR \u00a7268). Moreover, the individual\npursuit of the satisfaction of needs leads to the development of the\nstate.\n\nFor Hegel, it is only in the state that the family develops into\ncivil society and where civil society gains greater\n\u201cactuality\u201d (PR \u00a7256\u201357). The state is where\nour \u201cconcrete freedom\u201d is realized as we conceive of\nourselves in our full social and political reality (PR\n\u00a7260). It is only here that the individual is conceived at once as\na member of a family, as a part of civil society and as a citizen of a\nstate. While the stage where our freedom is realized most concretely,\nit is not the case that individual freedom is somehow a problem \u2013\nour individual freedom has greatest actuality when mutually recognized\nby others in law. Hegel reflects that \u201cit has often been said\nthat the end of the state is the happiness of its citizens. This is\ncertainly true, for if their welfare is deficient, if their subjective\nends are not satisfied, and if they do not find that the state as such\nis the means to this satisfaction, the state itself stands on an\ninsecure footing\u201d (PR \u00a7265 Addition). Hegel\u2019s\nstate is a community where individuals and their individuality are\nmeant to flourish.\n\nHegel\u2019s conception of the state\u2019s composition is\ncontroversial. He seeks to unify the three traditional models of\ngovernment \u2013 aristocracy, democracy and monarchy \u2013 under a\nnew form of representative government with a constitutional monarch\n(Deranty 2001). Hegel proposes an Estates Assembly with the natural\naristocracy of the agrarian class in one chamber and representatives\nfrom different trades in another. Hegel believed that representing a\nlocality based on geography was arbitrary and lacking substance. He\nclaimed a stronger ethical relation could be formed through\nrepresentation of people through their work.\n\nHegel\u2019s state is headed by a hereditary monarch (\u00a7273\nRemark, Brudner 1981, Redding 1994). He claims the state requires\nsomeone to provide unity as an individual to the individual state, a\nsomeone to declare the state confirms a law as its law or agrees\ntreaties with foreign countries. An elected monarch or president as\nhead of state is objectionable because such a person would represent\nthe interests of supporters. This would create a barrier for the\nmonarch to truly speak with one voice on behalf of the country \u2013\nand so the monarch should be above such partisanship. A hereditary\nmonarch would provide some basis for there being a head of state that\ncould represent all and provide the unity required.\n\nWhile virtually no commentator is convinced by Hegel\u2019s\njustification of constitutional monarch, the orthodox view is that the\nmonarch is a rubber stamp (Yack 1980). Hegel remarks that \u201cin a\nfully organized state \u2026 all that is required in a monarch is\nsomeone to say \u2018yes\u2019 and to dot the \u2018I\u2019; for\nthe supreme office should be such that the particular character of its\noccupant is of no significance\u201d (PR \u00a7280 Addition).\nSome have drawn comparisons with the UK\u2019s constitutional\nmonarchy, where laws require the Assent of Her Majesty The Queen but\nwhere this is automatically done when requested by Parliament for\nexample (Findlay 1958).\n\nThe real power is behind the throne and held by an educated\ngoverning cabinet [Ministerium], often referred to as the\nbureaucracy. It is these advisors to the monarch who propose new laws,\nvia the responsible cabinet minister. These ministers, and not the\nmonarch, are answerable to the legislature whose role is to consider\nproposals and either enact or reject them.\n\nThere is reason to doubt this picture (Brooks 2007). The monarch\ncannot act arbitrarily. In being \u201cbound by the concrete content\nof the advice he receives,\u201d he must be able to discern this\ncontent (PR \u00a7279 Addition). And Hegel is critical of the\nUK\u2019s constitutional monarchy post-Civil War noting that\n\u201csince 1692 there has never been a case of the king\u2019s\nvetoing a parliamentary decree\u201d with the consequence that it\n\u201creduces him virtually to a cipher\u201d and he should be more\nactive on state matters \u2013 and, presumably, making his own\njudgements whether to support proposed legislation or not in\nrecommending it for approval to the legislature (LNR \u00a7133\nRemark). While the ministers advising him should be of rough\nequality making little difference who is in which role, the monarch has\nfull discretion to hire and fire anyone at will from an eligible pool.\nMoreover, it is the monarch advised by his relevant minister who agree\ntreaties and decide all matters of war and peace (PR\n\u00a7329). Given the monarch cannot be removed from office, this gives\nhim considerable powers in foreign affairs raising questions about how\nrelatively powerless, if at all, he really is.\n",
