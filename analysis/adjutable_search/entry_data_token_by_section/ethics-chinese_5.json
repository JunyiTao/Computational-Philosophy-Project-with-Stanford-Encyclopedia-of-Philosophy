    "main_text": "Confucian Ethics || Xunzi versus Mencius on human nature and the origins of morality\n2.6 Xunzi versus Mencius on human nature and the origins of morality\n\nIn the Xing E (\u201c[Human] Nature is Bad\u201d) chapter\n(see Hutton 2014 for a translation), Xunzi explicitly opposes his\nposition on human nature to Mencius\u2019s. He asserts that far from\nbeing good, human nature is bad because it includes a love of profit,\nenvy and hatred, and desires of the eyes and ears that lead to\nviolence and anarchy. To avoid these consequences of indulging our\nspontaneous desires and impulses, it takes wei (conscious\nactivity or deliberate effort), models and teaching, and guidance\nthrough observing ritual and yi (standards of righteousness).\nThrough such efforts, natural emotions and desires are transformed as\na crooked piece of wood is steamed and then straightened upon a press\nframe. All rituals and standards of righteousness are sheng\n(generated, produced) by the sages. These are generated from the\nconscious activity of the sages and not from their original nature.\nJust as the vessel made by a potter is generated from his conscious\nactivity and not his original nature, so the sages accumulated their\nthoughts and ideas and made a practice of conscious activity and\nprecedents, thereby generating rituals and standards of\nrighteousness.\n\nPart of Xunzi\u2019s argument against Mencius is that human nature is\nnot what is produced by conscious activity but rather that which is\nalready there in human beings independently of conscious activity.\nSince it is clear that human beings are not already good but must work\nat it, it is clear that human nature cannot be good. When Mencius\nexpresses the water-metaphor view of the human inclination toward\ngoodness, Xunzi\u2019s criticism has a point. Becoming good does not\nseem to be merely a matter of not interfering with what will unfold in\nnormal circumstances. However, when Mencius expresses the\nsprout-metaphor view, the differences between him and Xunzi are more\nsubtle. On the sprout-metaphor view, effort and reflection must be put\ninto the project of extending the sprouts to where they should be. It\nmight be thought that one of the real differences between Mencius and\nXunzi is that the former believes the necessary effort lies in growing\nor extending what lies in human nature, whereas the latter believes\nthat the effort lies in remaking and reshaping what lies in human\nnature. Perhaps one believes that we can go \u201cwith the\ngrain\u201d of what we are born with, and the other believes we must\ngo \u201cagainst the grain.\u201d\n\nEach thinker emphasizes one of these opposing directions, but\nit is a credit to the subtlety and power of their views that each also\ntakes into account the direction that the other emphasizes. Mencius\nacknowledges that moral development is hindered when a person pays\nmore attention to the \u201csmall\u201d parts of the self that\ninclude desires for sensual and material satisfaction and fails to use\nthe heart-mind to reflect on the great parts that have normative\npriority. In the chapter on rituals, Xunzi identifies natural and\npowerful emotional dispositions such as love of one\u2019s own kind\nthat rituals must give expression to and that seem to form more of a\npositive basis for moral development. Such natural love is expressed\nin love for parents and intense grief upon their deaths, which must be\ngiven appropriate expression in mourning and burial rituals. Thus\nMencius acknowledges that there are natural parts of the self that\nmust be disciplined and held in check while Xunzi acknowledges that\nthere are natural parts that are largely congenial to morality in the\nsense that they are the natural basis for taking great satisfaction\nand contentment in virtue once one has gotten the self-aggrandizing\ndesires and emotions under control.\n\nAnother disagreement between Mencius and Xunzi has to do with\nMencius\u2019 claim that human nature contains moral predispositions.\nAs indicated earlier, such Mencian predispositions appear to contain\nmoral intuitions (e.g., about what is shameful and right or wrong). On\none plausible interpretation of Mencius, morality is part of the order\nimparted to the world by tian or heaven. By contrast, Xunzi\nseems to rule out the existence of natural predispositions with moral\ncontent when he claims that the sage kings generated ritual principles\nand precepts of moral duty. One natural interpretation of\n\u201cgenerated\u201d is \u201ccreated\u201d or\n\u201cinvented.\u201d On these interpretations of each thinker, the\ncontrast between Mencius and Xunzi exemplifies the contrast between a\nrobust moral realism that has moral properties such as rightness\nexisting independently of human invention and a constructivist\nposition that makes moral properties dependent on human invention.\n\nThe interpretation of Xunzi as a constructivist does not commit\nhim to a denial of the objectivity of morality or to the denial that\nthere is a single objectively correct morality. It is possible to see\nXunzi as a constructivist about morality but also as an objectivist\n(see Nivison, 1991). On the constructivist interpretation, Xunzi holds\na functional conception of morality, according to which it is invented\nto harmonize the interests of individuals and to constrain and\ntransform the heedless pursuit of short-term gratification for the\nsake of promoting the long-term interests of the individual and the\ngroup. Ritual principles and moral precepts are invented to accomplish\nsuch a function, and human nature constrains which of the possible\nprinciples and precepts are better or worse for accomplishing that\nfunction. Xunzi\u2019s point about the mourning rituals prescribed by\nConfucians being suited to the nature of human love for one\u2019s\nparents is a case in point.\n\nXunzi\u2019s functional theory of morality bears added interest for\nthose exploring the possibilities of a naturalistic approach to\nmorality. One fairly common interpretation of Xunzi\u2019s conception\nof tian or heaven is that it is an order-giving force in the\ncosmos that is neutral to whatever human beings have come to regard as\nright and good. In fact, a translation that better conveys such a\nmeaning for \u2018tian\u2019 is \u201cnature,\u201d which\nis the translation given by Knoblock\u2019s valued translation of the\nXunzi. Textual passages that support this interpretation\nstress that tian operates according to patterns that remain\nconstant no matter what human beings do or whether they appeal to it\nfor good fortune (chapter 17). It is the proper task of human beings\nto understand what these patterns are in order to take advantage of\nthem (e.g., so that they may know to plow in the spring, weed in the\nsummer, harvest in the fall, and store in the winter).\n\nSuch a view of the difference between Xunzi and Mencius, however,\ndepends on interpretations that been disputed in favor of alternative\ninterpretations. Roger Ames (1991, 2002) defends an interpretation of\nMencius that gives the greatest role in shaping the direction of moral\ndevelopment to human \u201ccreative social intelligence\u201d rather\nthan tian conceived as a force operating independently of\nhuman beings. For a contrasting view, see Irene Bloom (1994, 1997,\n2002), who, sometimes in response to Ames, defends a greater role for\nbiology in her interpretation of Mencius while also leaving an\nimportant role for culture. The Xunzi text is also\nsusceptible to very different interpretations, partly because of the\noriginality of its synthesis of several streams of thought:\nConfucianism, Daoism, Mohism, and the Jixia Academy. When Xunzi\nasserts that tian is unresponsive to human supplication and\nritual sacrifice, it looks as if he might be drawing from Daoism (see\nbelow), but when he refers to the tian-given faculties human\nbeings should exercise to solve the problem of conflict, he might be\ninterpreted as implying that tian conferred these faculties\nupon human beings for the purpose of solving the problem of\nconflict and realizing fulfilling human lives together (see Eno 1990;\nand Machle, 1993 for an exploration of the rich interpretive\npossibilities regarding Xunzi\u2019s conception of tian).\nWhile it might still be possible to interpret Xunzi as a\nconstructivist on the origin of morality, this alternative\ninterpretation might suggest that Xunzi\u2019s tian had a\nblueprint it intended human beings to fulfill. Under alternative\ninterpretations of Mencius and Xunzi, then, the differences do not\ndisappear, but they might form even more subtle contrasts (Wong,\n2016).\n\nEven some of the theoretical difficulties that Xunzi has are\ninstructive. In pressing his case against Mencius for the badness of\nhuman nature, he stresses the self-serving drives of human nature.\nUnlike Hobbes, he does not accept that human beings are inevitably\nmotivated by self-interest, and he does not try to base adherence to\nmoral norms on the basis of self-interest alone. This arguably is a\npromising move, given the heavy criticism that can be directed against\nthe Hobbesian project and subsequent attempts to carry it out its\nbasic idea (see Gauthier, 1986 for such an attempt; see Vallentyne,\n1991 for criticism). Xunzi rather argues that the problems created by\nunrestrained self-interest point to the need to transform human\nmotivation. People can come to love moral virtue and the rites for\ntheir own sakes, and this is necessary, on Xunzi\u2019s view, for a\nstable solution to the problem of conflict between self-interested\nindividuals. At times, Xunzi suggests that the intellect can override\nthe desires arising from the natural emotions, but it remains unclear\nas to how self-regarding motivations can become a love of virtue and\nthe rites simply because the intellect approves of them. The parts of\nXunzi asserting a more complex picture of human motivation suggest a\nsolution. If human beings are capable of genuine compassion and\nconcern for others, as the chapter on rites suggests, then the ritual\nprinciples and moral precepts invented by the sage kings have some\nmotivational leverage for the birth of a love of virtue and rites.\nSuch a solution draws from what are arguably some of the most\nplausible positions of Mencius: that human beings are capable of\naltruism and compassion even if they are motivated much of the time by\nself-interest; and that moral transformation is a matter of\ncultivating and extending a motivational substance that is congenial\nto morality (see Wong, 2000).\n\nMencius and Xunzi, then, offer sophisticated theories that expand the\nrange of possible ways of understanding moral knowledge, motivation,\nand the nature of morality itself. Mencius presents an interesting\nconception of the way that we reason by analogy from intuitive\njudgments and also a plausible conception of innate predispositions\nthat are compatible with a major role for learning and upbringing in\nthe development of character and virtue. Those who are more\nnaturalistically inclined in their approach to morality (at least\ninsofar as this involves resisting the idea of a transcendent source\nof moral properties) may find the interpretation of Xunzi as offering\na functional conception of morality appealing, especially if it allows\nfor a degree of objectivity regarding the content of morality.\n",
