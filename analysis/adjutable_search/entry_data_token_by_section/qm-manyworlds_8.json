    "main_text": "Correspondence Between the Formalism and Our Experience || Preferred Basis\n3.5 Preferred Basis\n\nThe mathematical structure of the theory (i) allows infinitely many\nways to decompose the quantum state of the Universe into a\nsuperposition of orthogonal states. The basis for the decomposition\ninto world states follows from the definition of a world composed of\nobjects in definite positions and states (\u201cdefinite\u201d on\nthe scale of our ability to distinguish them). In the alternative\napproach, the basis of a centered world is defined directly by an\nobserver. Therefore, given the nature of the observer and her concepts\nfor describing the world, the particular choice of the decomposition\n(2) follows (up to a precision which is good FAPP, as required). If we\ndo not ask why we are what we are, and why the world we perceive is\nwhat it is, but only how we can explain relations between the events\nwe observe in our world, then the problem of the preferred basis does\nnot arise: we and the concepts of our world define the preferred\nbasis.\n\nBut if we do ask why we are what we are, we can explain more. Looking\nat the details of the physical world, the structure of the\nHamiltonian, the value of the Planck constant, etc., one can\nunderstand why the sentient beings we know are of a particular type\nand why they have their particular concepts for describing their\nworlds. The main argument is that the locality of interactions yields\nthe stability of worlds in which objects are well localized. The\nsmall value of the Planck constant allows macroscopic objects to be\nwell localized for a long period of time. Worlds corresponding to\nlocalized quantum states \\(\\ket{\\Psi_{\\world\\ i}}\\) do not split for a\nlong enough time such that sentient beings can perceive the locations\nof macroscopic objects. By contrast, a \u201cworld\u201d obtained in\nanother decomposition, e.g., the \u201cworld +\u201d which is\ncharacterized by the relative phase of a superposition of states of\nmacroscopic objects being in macroscopically distinguishable states\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\,(\\ket{\\Psi_A} +\n\\ket{\\Psi_B})\\ket{\\Phi},\\) splits immediately, during a period of time\nwhich is much smaller than the perception time of any feasible\nsentient being, into two worlds: the new \u201cworld+\u201d and the\n\u201cworld\\(-\\)\u201d:\n\\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\,(\\ket{\\Psi_A}-\\ket{\\Psi_B})\\ket{\\Phi'}.\\) This is the\nphenomenon of\n decoherence\n which has attracted enormous attention in recent years, e.g., Joos\net al. 2003, Zurek 2003, Schlosshauer 2007, Wallace 2012,\nRiedel 2017, Schlosshauer 2019, Boge 2019, Saunders forthcoming-a also in the\n\u201cdecoherent histories\u201d framework of Gell-Mann and Hartle\n1990, see Saunders 1995 and Riedel et al.2016.\n",
