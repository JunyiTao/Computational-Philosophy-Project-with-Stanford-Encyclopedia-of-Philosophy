The key\nquestion is one that Rousseau first posed in the Emile:\n\n\nHow far should the rights of an international federation be stretched\nwithout destroying the rights of national sovereignty? (1762 [1979:\n466])\n\n\nThe context is different in the sense that, instead of the single\ninternational federation envisaged by Rousseau, international law has\ndeveloped through a multitude of universal and regional international\norganizations.\n\nBut questions about the boundaries between the domestic and the\ninternational legal sphere, and their respective institutions, are\neven more important nowadays as international organizations exercise\nfunctions that once were within the exclusive domain of states. These\nquestions lie at the heart of the most recent debates about\ninternational law, populism (M\u00fcller 2016; Alston 2017) and the\nrise of authoritarian international law (Ginsburg 2020). Some question\nthe dualism or pluralism on which these arguments are premised, and\nprefer to think of domestic and international law as forming part of\nthe same legal order. Kelsen was the most famous proponent of these\n\u201cmonist\u201d conceptions (Bernstorff 2010; for another attempt\nto show the compatibility of state sovereignty with the authority of\ninternational law with the notion of changing sovereignty regimes and\nconstitutional pluralism, see Jean Cohen 2010).\n\nAn important set of normative questions concerns the relationship\nbetween international organizations and political and individual\nliberty. Some argue that while the transfer of sovereign functions to\ninternational organizations can be justified for a number of moral and\npolitical reasons, it cannot extend to the point where it jeopardizes\nhuman rights or hollows out self-government\u2014these limits are\nnecessary to preserve the liberal character of the international order\n(Verdirame 2013).\n\nMany contemporary writers focus on the European Union, which has been\ndescribed as \u201csupranational\u201d, rather than international,\nin light of the direct primacy that EU law enjoys within domestic\nlegal spheres (Neyer & Wiener 2011a; van Middelaar 2013). Whether\nsupranationalism is a way of ascribing sovereignty to the European\nUnion or a way of reconceiving the legal order in a\npost-sovereignist and cosmopolitan sense is an open debate\n(Eriksen 2011). For others, the process of European integration poses\na challenge to the modern liberal constitutional sense of sovereignty\nas understood to include the \u201coverall competency and\nresponsibility for the common welfare of the people united into a\npolity\u2026.\u201d, and the shift of the regulatory power over the\neconomy away from the State risks paving the way for \u201ca\nfragmentation of the care for the common good\u201d\n(B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde 1997).\n\nThese normative concerns become more acute in the case of a fully\nfledged world government. Kant, in Perpetual Peace, reached a\nfamously sobering conclusion on the prospect of international\norganizations developing into such a world government:\n\n\nThe idea of the right of nations presupposes the separation of many\nneighbouring states independent of one another; and though such a\ncondition is of itself a condition of war (unless a federative union\nof them prevents the outbreak of hostilities), this is nevertheless\nbetter, in accordance with the idea of reason, than the fusion of them\nby one power overgrowing the rest and passing into a universal\nmonarchy, since as the range of government expands laws progressively\nlose their vigour, and a soulless despotism, after it has destroyed\nthe seed of good, finally deteriorates into anarchy. (Kant 1795 [1996:\n336])\n\n\nOne of the leading contemporary political and legal philosophers,\nJoseph Raz, shares Kant\u2019s scepticism about world government, but\nargues that there may be a better alternative to world government than\na world of sovereign states. That alternative is one of relatively\nsovereign states, which are however subject to binding regulations\nissued by international organizations (Raz 2019).\n\nThe balancing act between cosmopolitan international law (i.e., law\nthat binds all states) and domestic sovereignty is famously explored\nin John Rawls\u2019 Law of Peoples (Rawls 1999; see also\nWenar 2008 [2021]). Rawls himself does not use the concept\n\u201csovereignty\u201d, or \u201cstate\u201d, in relation to the\nsocieties that are members of his \u201cSociety of Peoples\u201d,\nbut that is because he associates \u201csovereignty\u201d with an\nabsolutist conception, and regards \u201cstates\u201d as claiming\nsuch sovereignty. In contrast, his theory upholds a more restricted\nnotion of sovereignty for \u201cwell-ordered peoples\u201d. Such\npeoples enjoy both legitimacy with respect to their own citizens and\nfull international standing in the Society of Peoples, which includes\nimmunity from intervention.\n",
