    "main_text": "Emotions and religious experience\n2. Emotions and religious experience\n\nMany commentators have thought that the phenomenology of religious\nexperience depends in significant part on its affective tone. When God\nis made known in the experience of guilt, as someone to whom we are\naccountable and who summons us to newness of life, or when God is\nrevealed in the feeling of wonderment at the vastness or beauty of the\ncosmos, or when God is manifest in the experience of encountering some\nthrilling and awe-inspiring \u201cother,\u201d or in many other\ncases too, the religious import of the experience is given in large\npart in our affective responses. It is noteworthy too how often the\nlanguage of \u201cspiritual sensations\u201d involves reference to\nstates of feeling. And perhaps this is a conceptual requirement: what\nsense would there be in the idea of a religiously authentic encounter\nwith God, the supreme good and maker of all, which left the subject of\nthe experience unmoved?\n",
