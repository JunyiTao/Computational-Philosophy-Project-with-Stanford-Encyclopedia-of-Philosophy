    "main_text": "One-self Theories || Selves, gods, and modes\n1.1 Selves, gods, and modes\n\nA self is a being who is in principle capable of knowledge,\nintentional action, and interpersonal relationships. A deity is\ncommonly understood to be a sort of extraordinary self. In the Bible,\nthe deity Yahweh (a.k.a. \u201cthe LORD\u201d) commands, forgives,\ncontrols history, predicts the future, occasionally appears in\nhumanoid form, enters into covenants with human beings, and sends\nprophets, whom he even allows to argue with him. More than a common\ndeity in a pantheon of deities, he is portrayed as being the one\ncreator of the cosmos, and as having uniquely great power, knowledge,\nand goodness.\n\nTrinitarians hold this revelation of the one God as a great self to\nhave been either supplemented or superseded by later revelation which\nshows the one God in some sense to be three \u201cPersons.\u201d\n(Greek: hypostaseis or prosopa, Latin:\npersonae) But if these divine Persons are selves, then the\nclaim is that there are three divine selves, which would seem to be\nthree gods. Some Trinity theories understand the Persons to be selves,\nand then try to show that the falsity of monotheism does not follow.\n(See section\n 2\n below.) But a rival approach is to explain that these three divine\nPersons are really ways the one divine self is, that is to say, modes\nof the one god. In current terms, one reduces all but one of the three\nor four apparent divine selves (Father, Son, Spirit, the triune God)\nto the remaining one. One of these four is the one god, and the others\nare his modes. Because the New Testament seems to portray the Son and\nSpirit as somehow subordinate to the one God, one-self Trinity\ntheories always either reduce Father, Son, and Spirit to modes of the\none, triune God, or reduce the Son and Spirit to modes of the Father,\nwho is supposed to be numerically identical to the one God. (See\nsection\n 1.8\n for views on which only the Holy Spirit is reduced to a mode of God,\nthat is, the Father.)\n\nBecause God in the Bible is portrayed as a great self, at the popular\nlevel of trinitarian Christianity one-self thinking has a firm hold.\nLiturgical statements, song lyrics, and sermons frequently use\ntrinitarian names (\u201cFather\u201d, \u201cSon\u201d,\n\u201cJesus\u201d, \u201cGod\u201d, etc.) as if they were\ninterchangeable, co-referring terms, referring directly or indirectly\n(via a mode) to one and the same divine self.\n",
