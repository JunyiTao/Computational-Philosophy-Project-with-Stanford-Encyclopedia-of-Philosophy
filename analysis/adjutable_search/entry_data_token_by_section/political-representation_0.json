    "main_text": "Key Components of Political Representation\n1. Key Components of Political Representation\n\nPolitical representation, on almost any account, will exhibit the\nfollowing five components:\n\nsome party that is representing (the\nrepresentative, an organization, movement, state agency, etc.);\nsome party that is being represented (the\nconstituents, the clients, etc.);\nsomething that is being represented (opinions,\nperspectives, interests, discourses, etc.); and\na setting within which the activity of representation is\ntaking place (the political context).\nsomething that is being left out (the opinions,\ninterests, and perspectives not voiced).\n\n\nTheories of political representation often begin by specifying the\nterms for the first four components. For instance, democratic\ntheorists often limit the types of representatives being discussed to\nformal representatives \u2014 that is, to representatives who hold\nelected offices. One reason that the concept of representation remains\nelusive is that theories of representation often apply only to\nparticular kinds of political actors within a particular context. How\nindividuals represent an electoral district is treated as distinct\nfrom how social movements, judicial bodies, or informal organizations\nrepresent. Consequently, it is unclear how different forms of\nrepresentation relate to each other. Andrew Rehfeld (2006) has offered\na general theory of representation which simply identifies\nrepresentation by reference to a relevant audience accepting a person\nas its representative. One consequence of Rehfeld\u2019s general\napproach to representation is that it allows for undemocratic cases of\nrepresentation. \n\nHowever, Rehfeld\u2019s general theory of representation does not\nspecify what representative do or should do in order to be recognized\nas a representative. And what exactly representatives do has\nbeen a hotly contested issue. In particular, a controversy has raged\nover whether representatives should act as delegates or\ntrustees.\n",
