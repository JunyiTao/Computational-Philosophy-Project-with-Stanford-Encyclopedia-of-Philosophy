    "main_text": "Which Rights are Human Rights? || Rights of Women, Minorities, and Groups\n3.3 Rights of Women, Minorities, and Groups\n\nEquality of rights for historically disadvantaged or subordinated\ngroups is a longstanding concern of the human rights movement. Human\nrights documents repeatedly emphasize that all people,\nincluding women and members of minority ethnic and religious groups,\nhave equal human rights and should be able to enjoy them without\ndiscrimination. The right to freedom from discrimination figures\nprominently in the Universal Declaration and subsequent treaties. The\nCivil and Political Covenant, for example, commits participating\nstates to respect and protect their people\u2019s rights\n\u201cwithout distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex,\nlanguage, political or other opinion, national or social origin,\nproperty, birth, or social status\u201d (on minority and group rights\nsee Kymlicka 1995, Nickel 2007).\n\nA number of standard individual rights are especially important to\nethnic and religious minorities, including rights to freedom of\nassociation, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom\nfrom discrimination. Human rights documents also include rights that\nrefer to minorities explicitly and give them special protections. For\nexample, the Civil and Political Covenant in Article 27 says that\npersons belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities\n\u201cshall not be denied the right, in community with other members\nof their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice\ntheir own religion, or to use their own language.\u201d\n\nFeminists have often protested that standard lists of human rights do\nnot sufficiently take into account the different risks faced by women\nand men. For example, issues like domestic violence, reproductive\nchoice, and trafficking of women and girls for sex work did not have a\nprominent place in early human rights documents and treaties. Lists of\nhuman rights have had to be expanded \u201cto include the degradation\nand violation of women\u201d (Bunch 2006, 58; see also Lockwood 2006\nand Okin 1998). Violations of women\u2019s human rights often occur\nin the home at the hands of other family members, not in the street at\nthe hands of the police. Most violence against women occurs in the\n\u201cprivate\u201d sphere. This has meant that governments cannot\nbe seen as the only addressees of human rights and that the right to\nprivacy of home and family needs qualifications to allow police to\nprotect women within the home.\n\nThe issue of how formulations of human rights should respond to\nvariations in the sorts of risks and dangers that different people\nface is difficult and arises not just in relation to gender but also\nin relation to age, profession, political affiliation, religion, and\npersonal interests. Due process rights, for example, are much more\nuseful to young people (and particularly young men) than they are to\nolder people since the latter are far less likely to run afoul of the\ncriminal law.\n\nSince 1964 the United Nations has mainly dealt with the rights of\nwomen and minorities through specialized treaties such as the\n International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\n (1965); the\n Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\n (1979); the\n Convention on the Rights of the Child\n (1989), and the\n Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n (2007). See also the\n Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\n (2007). Specialized treaties allow international norms to address\nunique problems of particular groups such as assistance and care\nduring pregnancy and childbearing in the case of women, custody issues\nin the case of children, and the loss of historic territories by\nindigenous peoples.\n\nMinority groups are often targets of violence. Human rights norms call\nupon governments to refrain from such violence and to provide\nprotections against it. This work is partly done by the right to life,\nwhich is a standard individual right. It is also done by the right\nagainst genocide which protects some groups from attempts to\ndestroy or decimate them. The Genocide Convention was one of\nthe first human rights treaties after World War II. The right against\ngenocide is clearly a group right. It is held by both individuals and\ngroups and provides protection to groups as groups. It is largely\nnegative in the sense that it requires governments and other agencies\nto refrain from destroying groups; but it also requires that legal and\nother protections against genocide be created at the national\nlevel.\n\nCan the right against genocide be a human right? More generally, can a\ngroup right fit the general idea of human rights proposed earlier? On\nthat conception, human rights are rights of all persons.\nPerhaps it can, however, if we broaden our conception of who can hold\nhuman rights to include important groups that people form and cherish\n(see the entry on\n group rights).\n This can be made more palatable, perhaps, by recognizing that the\nbeneficiaries of the right against genocide are individual humans who\nenjoy greater security against attempts to destroy the group to which\nthey belong (Kymlicka 1989).\n",
