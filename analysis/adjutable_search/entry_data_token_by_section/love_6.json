    "main_text": "Love as Valuing || An Intermediate Position?\n4.3 An Intermediate Position?\n\nPerhaps there is room for an understanding of love and its relation to\nvalue that is intermediate between appraisal and bestowal accounts.\nAfter all, if we think of appraisal as something like perception, a\nmatter of responding to what is out there in the world, and of\nbestowal as something like action, a matter of doing something and\ncreating something, we should recognize that the responsiveness\ncentral to appraisal may itself depend on our active, creative\nchoices. Thus, just as we must recognize that ordinary perception\ndepends on our actively directing our attention and deploying\nconcepts, interpretations, and even arguments in order to perceive\nthings accurately, so too we might think our vision of our\nbeloved\u2019s valuable properties that is love also depends on our\nactively attending to and interpreting him. Something like this is\nJollimore\u2019s view (2011). According to Jollimore, in loving\nsomeone we actively attend to his valuable properties in a way that we\ntake to provide us with reasons to treat him preferentially. Although\nwe may acknowledge that others might have such properties even to a\ngreater degree than our beloved does, we do not attend to and\nappreciate such properties in others in the same way we do those in\nour beloveds; indeed, we find our appreciation of our beloved\u2019s\nvaluable properties to \u201csilence\u201d our similar appreciation\nof those in others. (In this way, Jollimore thinks, we can solve the\nproblem of fungibility, discussed below in\n Section 6.)\n Likewise, in perceiving our beloved\u2019s actions and character, we\ndo so through the lens of such an appreciation, which will tend as to\n\u201csilence\u201d interpretations inconsistent with that\nappreciation. In this way, love involves finding one\u2019s beloved\nto be valuable in a way that involves elements of both appraisal\n(insofar as one must thereby be responsive to valuable properties\none\u2019s beloved really has) and bestowal (insofar as through\none\u2019s attention and committed appreciation of these properties\nthey come to have special significance for one).\n\nOne might object that this conception of love as silencing the special\nvalue of others or to negative interpretations of our beloveds is\nirrational in a way that love is not. For, it might seem, such\n\u201csilencing\u201d is merely a matter of our blinding\nourselves to how things really are. Yet Jollimore claims that this\nsense in which love is blind is not objectionable, for (a) we can\nstill intellectually recognize the things that love\u2019s vision\nsilences, and (b) there really is no impartial perspective we can take\non the values things have, and love is one appropriate sort of partial\nperspective from which the value of persons can be manifest.\nNonetheless, one might wonder about whether that perspective of love\nitself can be distorted and what the norms are in terms of which such\ndistortions are intelligible. Furthermore, it may seem that\nJollimore\u2019s attempt to reconcile appraisal and bestowal fails to\nappreciate the underlying metaphysical difficulty: appraisal is a\nresponse to value that is antecedently there, whereas bestowal is the\ncreation of value that was not antecedently there. Consequently, it\nmight seem, appraisal and bestowal are mutually exclusive and cannot\nbe reconciled in the way Jollimore hopes.\n\nWhereas Jollimore tries to combine separate elements of appraisal and\nof bestowal in a single account, Helm (2010) and Bagley (2015) offer\naccounts that reject the metaphysical presupposition that values must\nbe either prior to love (as with appraisal) or posterior to love (as\nwith bestowal), instead understanding the love and the values to\nemerge simultaneously. Thus, Helm presents a detailed account of\nvaluing in terms of the emotions, arguing that while we can understand\nindividual emotions as appraisals, responding to values\nalready their in their objects, these values are bestowed on\nthose objects via broad, holistic patterns of emotions. How this\namounts to an account of love will be discussed in\n Section 5.2,\n below. Bagley (2015) instead appeals to a metaphor of improvisation,\narguing that just as jazz musicians jointly make determinate the\ncontent of their musical ideas through on-going processes of their\nexpression, so too lovers jointly engage in \u201cdeep\nimprovisation\u201d, thereby working out of their values and\nidentities through the on-going process of living their lives\ntogether. These values are thus something the lovers jointly construct\nthrough the process of recognizing and responding to those very\nvalues. To love someone is thus to engage with them as partners in\nsuch \u201cdeep improvisation\u201d. (This account is similar to\nHelm (2008, 2010)\u2019s account of plural agency, which he uses to\nprovide an account of friendship and other loving relationships; see\nthe discussion of\n shared activity\n in the entry on\n friendship.)\n",
