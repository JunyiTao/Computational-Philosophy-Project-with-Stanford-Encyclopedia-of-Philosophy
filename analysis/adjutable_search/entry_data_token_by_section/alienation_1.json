    "main_text": "The Basic Idea || Elaborated\n1.2 Elaborated\n\nThat formulation of the basic idea is perhaps too abbreviated to be\neasily intelligible, and certainly benefits from a little elaboration.\nThe characterisation of alienation offered here\u2014as a social or\npsychological ill involving the problematic separation of a subject\nand object that belong together\u2014involves three constituent\nelements: a subject, an object, and the relation between them. It will\nbe helpful to say a little more about each of these in turn.\n\nFirst, the subject here is a self; typically, but not\nnecessarily, a person, an individual agent. \u2018Not\nnecessarily\u2019 because the subject could also be, for instance, a\ngroup of some kind. There seems to be no good reason to deny that a\ncollective as well as an individual agent might be alienated from some\nobject. For instance, as well as Anna being alienated from her\ngovernment, it might be that women or citizens find themselves\nalienated from their government.\n\nSecond, the relevant object can take a variety of forms.\nThese include: entities which are not a subject; another subject or\nsubjects; and oneself. The object here might be an entity which is not\na subject; for example, Beatrice might be alienated from the natural\nworld, from a social practice, from an institution, or from a social\nnorm, where none of those entities are understood as agents of any\nkind. In addition, the object might be an entity which is another\nsubject, another person or group; for example, Beatrice might be\nalienated from her childhood friend Cecile, and Beatrice might also be\nalienated from her own family. Lastly, the object here might be the\noriginal subject; that is, there might be reflexive variants of the\nrelation, for example, in which Beatrice is alienated from\nherself.\n\nThird, the relation is one of problematic separation between\na subject and object that belong together. All of these elements are required: there has to be a separation; the separation has to be problematic; and it has to obtain\nbetween a  subject and object that properly belong together.\n\nThe idea of separation is important. Not all problematic\nrelations between relevant entities involve alienation. For instance,\nbeing overly integrated into some other object might also be a\nproblematic or dysfunctional relation but it is not what is typically\nthought of as alienation. Imagine, for instance, that Cecile has no\nlife, no identity, finds no meaning, outside of her family membership.\nIt is tempting, at least for modern individuals, to say that she has\nan \u2018unhealthy\u2019 relationship with her family, but it would\nseem odd to say that she was alienated from it. Alienation typically\ninvolves a separation from something.\n\nThese problematic separations can be indicated by a wide\nvariety of words and phrases. No particular vocabulary seems to be\nrequired by the basic idea. The linguistic variety here might include\nwords suggesting: breaks (\u2018splits\u2019,\n\u2018ruptures\u2019, \u2018bifurcations\u2019,\n\u2018divisions\u2019, and so on); isolation\n(\u2018indifference\u2019, \u2018meaninglessness\u2019,\n\u2018powerlessness\u2019, \u2018disconnection\u2019, and so on);\nand hostility (\u2018conflicts\u2019, \u2018antagonism\u2019,\n\u2018domination\u2019, and so on). All these, and more, might be\nways of indicating problematic separations of the relevant kind. Of\ncourse, particular authors may use language more systematically, but\nthere seems little reason to insist that a specific vocabulary is\nrequired by the basic idea.\n\nThe idea of the relevant separation having to be, in some way,\nproblematic, is also important. Separations between a subject\nand object do not necessarily appear problematic. Relations of\nindifference, for example, might or might not be problematic. For an\nunproblematic instance, consider Daniela, a distinguished Spanish\narchitect, who\u2014when it is brought to her\nattention\u2014discovers that she is unconcerned with, and apathetic\ntowards, the complex constitutional relationship between the Pacific\nislands of Niue and New Zealand. Her indifference in this case looks\nunproblematic. Less obviously perhaps, the same might be true of\nrelations of hostility; that is, that hostility also might or might\nnot be problematic. For an unproblematic instance, consider Enid and\nFrancesca, two highly competitive middleweight boxers competing in the\nOlympics for the first time. It may well be that a certain amount of\nantagonism and rancour between these two individual sportswomen is\nentirely appropriate; after all, if Enid identifies too closely with\nFrancesca\u2014imagine her experiencing every blow to\nFrancesca\u2019s desires and interests as a defeat for her\nown\u2014she is not only unlikely to make it to the podium, but is\nalso, in some way, failing qua boxer.\n\nThe suggestion here is that to be appropriately\nproblematic\u2014appropriate, that is, to constitute examples of\nalienation\u2014the separations have to obtain between a subject and\nobject that properly belong together (Wood 2004: 3). More\nprecisely, that the candidate separations have to frustrate or\nconflict with the proper harmony or connectedness between that subject\nand object. Imagine, for instance, that both the indifference of\nDaniela, and the hostility of Enid, now also take appropriately\nproblematic forms. Perhaps we discover that Daniela has become\nincreasingly indifferent to her lifelong vocation, that she no longer\ncares about the design and construction issues over which she had\npreviously always enthused and obsessed; whilst Enid has started to develop feelings of loathing and suspicion for her domestic partner who she had previously trusted and loved. What makes these examples of separation (indifference and hostility) appear appropriately problematic is that they violate some\nbaseline condition of harmony or connectedness between the relevant\nentities. (A baseline condition that does not seem to obtain in the\nearlier examples of unproblematic separation.) Alienation\nobtains when a separation between a subject and object that properly\nbelong together, frustrates or conflicts with that baseline\nconnectedness or harmony. To say that they properly belong together is\nto suggest that the harmonious or connected relation between the\nsubject and object is rational, natural, or good. And, in turn, that\nthe separations frustrating or conflicting with that baseline\ncondition, are correspondingly irrational, unnatural, or bad. (For\nsome resistance to this characterisation, see Gilabert 2020,\n55\u201356.) Of course, that is not yet to identify what might establish\nthis baseline harmony as, say, rational, natural, or good. Nor is it\nto claim that the disruption of the baseline harmony is\nall-things-considered bad, that alienation could never be a justified\nor positive step. (These issues are discussed further in sections 4.1\nand 5.2, respectively.)\n",
