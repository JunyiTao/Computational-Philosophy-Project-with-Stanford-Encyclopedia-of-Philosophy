    "main_text": "Perceptual theories || Direct and indirect perceptual theories\n3.4 Direct and indirect perceptual theories\n\nThe perceptual view of pain as presented so far is a view even an\nindirect realist can subscribe to, although, as a matter of historical\nfact, very few indirect realists have done so (Perkins 1983, 2006;\nMaund 2003, 2006). A sense-datum theorist is someone who thinks that\nall perception of extramental reality is indirect, mediated by a\ndirect perception of sense-data that stand in certain systematic\nrelations to extramental objects in the world in virtue of which\nsense-data contingently come to represent them. So it is entirely\npossible, in fact reasonable, to hold that pain sense-data are also\nrepresentational. In other worlds, direct awareness of pain sense-data\ncould constitute the indirect perception of tissue damage in bodily\nregions which typically and systematically cause these sense-data.\n\nThe reason why this line was not pursued by indirect realists has\nprobably something to do with the intuitive resistance against any\nperceptual view of pain already embedded in our ordinary conception\nthat we discussed\n above.[12]\n Indirect realists like sense-datum theorists, as we have already\nseen, have the theoretical resources to accommodate the intuitive\nunderstanding of pain without forcing it into a perceptualist mold.\nWithout any qualms, they can say that we are directly and immediately\naware of pain qua a mental object or quality, whether or not\nthis represents or signals tissue damage. This is to say that they\nalready have a locus of concept application in their theory for the\nconcept of pain: PAIN directly applies to the experience or to its\ninternal direct object, i.e., to either a sense-datum or to\nits direct awareness. This seems to accommodate all the intuitions\nembedded in common sense; why go further? Furthermore, if one is not a\nperceptualist, one doesn\u2019t have an obligation to deal with what\nwe\u2019ll call below the problem of focus, the problem of\nexplaining why there is an asymmetry in conceptual focus between pain\nand standard exteroception if both are genuinely perceptual.\n\nIn practice, however, almost all defenders of perceptual view of pains\nare direct realists. If one wants to run a direct realist version of\nthe perceptual theory, however, one immediately runs into the\ndifficulty of finding an appropriate locus for direct perceptual\nawareness, and for that matter, a locus for immediate concept\napplication; that is, one runs into the difficulty of finding an\nobject, state, or event to which we spontaneously apply PAIN, ITCH,\nTICKLE, etc., when we are introspectively aware of our pains, itches,\ntickles, etc., and report them on this basis. This difficulty arises\nbecause the mark of any (early) direct realism in the theory of\nperception is the repudiation of consciously available perceptual\nintermediaries that mediate standard exteroception: when I see a red\napple on the table, there is no object or quality distinct from the\napple and its redness such that I see the apple in virtue of seeing\nit (or more generally, in virtue of directly perceiving or\nbeing aware of it). On the direct realist view, when I see an\napple, I directly perceive, or am directly acquainted with, the apple\nand its qualities such as its redness. This view works well in\nveridical perception: the locus of concept application is always the\npublic object of perception, like the apple and its properties. It\nalso explains why the spontaneous concept application is the way it is\neven when one hallucinates or has illusions. Even when one\nhallucinates a red apple, one is naturally disposed to apply the\nconcept RED APPLE to what one either takes or is tempted to take to be\nthe public object of one\u2019s epistemic efforts and its publicly\navailable features, and rarely, if ever, to what one believes to be a\nprivate mental object or quality.\n\nBut how is the repudiation of consciously available perceptual\nintermediaries to be reconciled with the admission that the concept of\npain is the concept of a subjective sensation/experience of a certain\nsort? Recall that most perceptual theorists admit that introspective\nreports of pain in body regions are reports of experiences\nthat represent physical disorder of some sort in those regions. This\nis just to say that when one is in pain one is directly aware of a\nsensation or experience, i.e., pain. This in turn means that the\nconcepts we are spontaneously prompted to apply in having pains and\nother intransitive bodily sensations directly apply to the prompting\nsensations/experiences in the first place \u2014 appearances to the\ncontrary. So how to understand the direct realist\u2019s talk of\nconscious sensations or experiences?\n",
