    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa was born on 14 September 1486 in Cologne.\nHe matriculated at the University of Cologne in 1499 and graduated in\n1502. The degree in medicine which he claimed to have earned was ruled\nout by Prost (1882: 67\u201374), who also raised serious doubts about\nhis doctorates in Canon and Civil Law (in utroque iure).\nNauert (1965: 10\u201311), however, suggested that they might have\nbeen obtained during the two periods of his life about which we have\nvery little information: 1502\u20131507 and 1511\u20131518. Agrippa\ncame into contact with the school of Albertus Magnus at Cologne, where\nit was still a living tradition and where he pursed his interest in\nnatural philosophy, encountering the Historia naturalis\n(Natural History) of Pliny the Elder for the first time.\nAndreas Canter, the city poet of Cologne, probably introduced him to\nLullism\u2014later, Agrippa wrote a long commentary, printed at\nCologne in 1531, on Lull\u2019s Ars magna (Great\nArt). During his youthful studies, Agrippa also established\npersonal relationships with those German humanists who shared his\ninterest in ancient wisdom. He spent a short period in Paris, where he\nmight have been a student. With some French friends, he formed a\nsodalitium, a sort of secret circle or initiatory\nbrotherhood, which, according the collection of letters from and to\nAgrippa, included Charles de Bovelles (c. 1479\u20131533), Symphorien\nChampier (c. 1471\u20131539), Germain de Brie (c. 1489\u20131538),\nGermain de Ganay (d. 1520), the portraitist at the French court Jean\nPerr\u00e9al (c. 1455\u20131530), and an unknown Italian friend,\nLandulfus. Between 1508 and 1509, Agrippa undertook a mysterious\njourney to Spain, seemingly engaged in a military mission. In 1509 he\nwas charged with a course of lectures on Johannes Reuchlin\u2019s\nDe verbo mirifico (On the Wonder-Working Word) at\nthe University of D\u00f4le in Burgundy. This academic appointment\nhad been supported by the chancellor of the university, Archbishop\nAntoine de Vergy. In the inaugural lecture, Agrippa pronounced a\nprolusion in honor of the daughter of Emperor Maximilian, Margaret of\nAustria, Princess of Austria and Burgundy. He planned to develop the\nspeech into a more comprehensive treatise in praise of womankind,\ndedicating it to Margaret. Therefore, he began to draft, but perhaps\ndid not finish, his celebrated De nobilitate et praecellentia\nfoeminei sexus declamatio (Declamation on the Nobility and\nPre-Eminence of the Female Sex), which was published only in\n1529. Agrippa\u2019s teaching on Christian kabbalah attracted\nconsiderable interest among the members of the university and of the\nlocal Parlement, and he joined the collegium of\ntheologians. Unfortunately, not everyone had a benevolent attitude to\nwhat sounded like an attempt to spread the \u201cmost criminal,\ncondemned and prohibited art of kabbalah\u201d\n(Expostulatio, p. 494) in Christian schools. The Franciscan\nJean Catilinet, the provincial superior for Burgundy, preaching in the\npresence of Margaret at the court of Low Countries in Ghent, denounced\nAgrippa as a \u201cjudaizing heretic\u201d (ibidem). This\ncharge put an end to Agrippa\u2019s teaching career in D\u00f4le and\ndashed his hopes of obtaining Margaret\u2019s favor. Returning to\nGermany, in the winter of 1509\u20131510 Agrippa went to the\nmonastery of St. Jacob at W\u00fcrzburg to meet Johannes Trithemius,\nAbbot of Sponheim. Over the course of a few intense days, the famous\nabbot and his young visitor discussed a topic of mutual interest:\nnatural magic and its role in contemporary culture. The meeting had a\ncrucial impact on Agrippa. He quickly finished a compendium\non magic, which he had been working on for some time. The first draft\nof De occulta philosophia was dedicated to Trithemius, who\nreceived the manuscript shortly before 8 April 1510 and generously\npraised Agrippa\u2019s commitment. The book circulated in manuscript,\nas evidence from Agrippa\u2019s correspondence shows; but he\ncontinued to assemble materials in order to revise this first draft.\nThis aim was achieved only twenty years later.\n\nIn London, where he had gone in 1510 to carry out a political and\n\u201cvery secret assignment\u201d (occultissimum negotium,\nDefensio, F. B6), probably on the orders of Emperor\nMaximilian, he became familiar with John Colet, who introduced him to\nthe study of St. Paul\u2019s epistles. Agrippa wrote\nCommentariola (Little Commentaries) on the Epistle\nto the Romans, which he then lost in Italy and recovered only in 1523,\nbut which remain totally unknown to us. During his stay in London,\nAgrippa replied to Catilinet\u2019s accusations with a polemical\nExpostulatio super Expositione sua in librum De verbo mirifico cum\nJoanne Catilineti (Expostulation with Jean Catilinet over His\nExposition of the Book On the Wonder-Working Word)\u2014just the\nfirst in a series of countless epic battles between him and\ncontemporary scholastic theologians. From 1511 to 1518, Agrippa was in\nItaly, serving Maximilian, but his military duties did not prevent him\nfrom pursuing his philosophical interests. He lectured on\nPlato\u2019s Symposium (Convivium) and on the\nHermetic Pimander (that is, the Corpus Hermeticum)\nat the University of Pavia, in 1512 and 1515 respectively. He probably\nbelieved that he might be able to achieve his academic ambitions\nthere, but his fervent expectations were soon disappointed. After the\ndefeat of the Swiss and Imperial troops at Marignano (13\u201314\nSeptember 1515), he was forced to quit teaching and to abandon Pavia.\nHe then sought patronage at the court of William IX Paleologus,\nMarquis of Monferrato, to whom he promptly dedicated two little works,\nDe homine (On Humankind) and De triplici ratione\ncognoscendi Deum (On the Threefold Way of Knowing God),\ngathering together some notes and materials he had already organized\nor perhaps even prepared for press, in Pavia. Both works attest to the\nimportance of Agrippa\u2019s contact with early sixteenth-century\nItalian culture. During his stay in Italy, he joined a network of\nfriends and correspondents, who allowed him to deepen his knowledge of\nNeoplatonic and Hermetic literature, to sharpen his acquaintance with\nkabbalistic texts, and to broaden and update his bibliographical\ninformation. For a time he was in Turin, where he lectured on\ntheological topics.\n\nIn the following years, Agrippa was in Metz (1518\u20131520), as the\ncity orator and advocate (advocatus), in Geneva\n(1521\u20131523), where he practiced medicine, and, finally in\nFreiburg (until 1524), as the city physician. Throughout this period,\nhe came into contact with a number of humanists who were engaging with\nthe new religious ideas circulating at the time. Therefore, his\nreputation as an \u201coccult philosopher\u201d assumed more complex\naspects. His De originali peccato declamatio (Declamation\non Original Sin), written in 1518 but not printed until 1529,\npuzzled the dedicatee, Dietrich Wichwael, Bishop of Cyrene, and\nAgrippa\u2019s friend Claude Dieudonn\u00e9 with regard to his\ninterpretation of Adam\u2019s sin as consisting in the sexual act. In\nMetz, he was involved in the debate on St. Anne\u2019s triple\nmarriage, expressing his passionate support for Jacques Lef\u00e8vre\nd\u2019\u00c9taples\u2019 criticism of the popular legend that\nattributed three husbands and three daughters to her. In De\nBeatissimae Annae monogamia ac unico puerperio (On St.\nAnne\u2019s Monogamy and Sole Childbirth, printed in Cologne,\n1534), he gave a fierce reply to the accusations of heresy leveled at\nLef\u00e8vre (and at himself) by three conservative monks. The\ndefense was vehement and strongly sarcastic: no wonder Lef\u00e8vre\nd\u2019\u00c9taples reacted anxiously to Agrippa\u2019s promise to\nbecome his ally. Meanwhile, Agrippa had successfully defended a woman\nof Woippy who was accused of being a witch, saving her from the stake.\nThanks to these courageous positions and his intense relationships\nwith pre-Reform circles, Agrippa was gradually assuming a by no means\nsecondary role in the general movement against the scholastic\ntradition. He won the esteem of many scholars (some of them would\nlater on join the Reformation), but, at the same time, attracted the\nparticular attention of the religious authorities.\n\nIn spring of 1524 Agrippa moved to Lyon to take up the office of\nphysician to the French king\u2019s mother, Louise of Savoy. He tried\nto win the favor of the king\u2019s sister, Marguerite\nd\u2019Alen\u00e7on, by dedicating to her his declamation De\nsacramento matrimonii (On the Sacrament of Marriage,\n1526) in parallel Latin and French versions. Unfortunately, it was a\nblunder and a terrible failure. The princess (who had recently been\nwidowed) was already hostile to the Erasmian \u2018spirit\u2019,\nwhich Agrippa referred to in order to claim the lawfulness and benefit\nof second marriages. Furthermore, ecclesiastical authorities were able\nto recognize the influence of some Erasmus\u2019 condemned works on\nAgrippa\u2019s positive attitude towards marriage, as well as the\nlink which connected it to the treatise De sacro coniugio\n(On Holy Wedlock) of the Franciscan Fran\u00e7ois Lambert,\nwho had fled to Strasbourg after joining the Reformation.\nAgrippa\u2019s position at court was becoming worse. His friendships,\nhis sympathies for the work of humanist Reformers, his more and more\naggressive theses\u2014in 1526 he reworked an earlier oration or\nletter, Dehortatio gentilis theologiae (Dissuasion from\nPagan Theology), in which he criticized contemporaries for their\nexcessive curiosity about Hermetic theology and their disregard for\nChristian education\u2014were raising doubts his religious orthodoxy.\nHis correspondence with the Duke of Bourbon, who had betrayed the\nFrench Crown in order to side with the Emperor, called into question\nhis political loyalties, and he was suspected of involvement in a\nplot. His refusal to furnish an astrological prognostication for\nFran\u00e7ois I and his incautious remarks about Louise\u2019s\nsuperstition, which a friend passed on to her, sparked off her open\nhostility. Agrippa was stripped of his pension and forbidden to leave\nFrance. In the midst of such dramatic misadventures, he wrote his\nDe incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum. It was a biting\ncommentary on all human sciences and arts and a fierce attack on the\nmoral and social assumptions of his day. Agrippa subjected the work to\nlater revisions and enlargements, right up to the moment of\npublication, in 1530.\n\nWhen, at last, he was allowed to leave France, Agrippa accepted the\noffice of archivist and imperial historiographer at the court of\nMargaret of Austria, governor of the Low Countries, in Antwerp. He\nfinally dedicated himself to publishing his writings. In 1529 a\ncollection of his short treatises was printed in Antwerp by Michael\nHillenius, and in 1530 another Antwerp printer, Johannes Graphaeus,\nbrought out De vanitate. In 1531, Graphaeus also printed the\nenlarged version of Book I of De occulta philosophia,\ndedicated to Hermann von Wied, Archbishop Elector of Cologne\n(1477\u20131552), and the table of contents for Book II and III. Both\nDe vanitate and De occulta philosophia circulated\nwidely, thanks to further editions (in Antwerp, Cologne, and Paris),\nand once more Agrippa found himself in trouble with the religious\nauthorities. The Louvain theologians, questioned by Margaret of\nAustria herself, condemned De vanitate as scandalous, impious\nand heretical, and so did the Sorbonne with respect to the Paris\nedition. The Parlement at Mechelin was informed of the\nLouvain professors\u2019 judgment, and required Agrippa to answer\ntheir accusations. He replied with two fearless writings, refuting,\npoint by point, the criticisms in his Apologia\n(Defense) and accusing, in turn, his opponents of ignorance\nand bad faith in his Querela (Complaint). These\nevents obviously put an end to Agrippa\u2019s career at\nMargaret\u2019s court, and he was once again seeking a new protector.\nHermann von Wied, who was both interested in occult sciences and\nsympathized with moderate religious reform, offered him protection\nand, in June 1532, brought him into his own household. Eventually,\nAgrippa was able to deliver the complete, final version of De\nocculta philosophia to the Cologne printer Johannes Soter, who in\nNovember was already typesetting it. Shortly before Christmas,\nhowever, the Dominican inquisitor Conrad K\u00f6llin denounced the\nbook as heretical and blasphemous, getting the city\u2019s Senate to\nsuspend the printing. Agrippa\u2019s impassioned and controversial\nappeal to the Cologne Senate (Zika 2003: 99\u2013124) did not succeed\nin resolving the impasse. It was, instead, the forceful intervention\nof Hermann which enabled De occulta philosophia to appear,\neven though accompanied by an appendix including the chapters of\nDe vanitate which criticized magic.\n\nWe are not informed about the last years of Agrippa\u2019s life,\nbecause his correspondence stops in July 1533. He was perhaps the\nauthor of a self-defense, Dialogus de vanitate scientiarum et\nruina Christianae religionis (Dialogue on the Vanity of the\nSciences and the Ruin of Christian Religion), fictitiously\nattributed to Godoschalcus Moncordius, an otherwise unknown Cistercian\nmonk, and printed, in all probability, by Johannes Soter in 1534\n(Zambelli 1965: 220\u201323). On 22 February 1534, from Bonn, Agrippa\naddressed a legal memorandum to the Parliament of the Low Countries\n(Zambelli 1965: 305\u201312). According to his pupil Johannes Wier\n(1515\u20131565), Agrippa was in Bonn until 1535. He then returned to\nFrance, where he was arrested on the order of Fran\u00e7ois I.\nShortly after his release, he died in Grenoble in 1535 or, at the\nlatest, in 1536.\n",
