    "main_text": "Egalitarianism and Justice || Relational Egalitarianism\n7. Conclusion\n\nWe saw at the beginning of this article that justice can take a number\nof different forms, depending on the practical context in which it is\nbeing applied. Although we found common elements running through this\ndiversity of use \u2013 most readily captured in Justinian\u2019s\n\u2018suum cuique\u2019 formula \u2013 these were formal\nrather than substantive. In these circumstances, it is natural to look\nfor an overarching framework into which the various contextually\nspecific conceptions of justice can all be fitted. Three such\nframeworks were examined: utilitarianism, contractarianism and\negalitarianism. None, however, passed what we might call the\n\u2018Sidgwick/Rawls test\u2019, namely that of incorporating and\nexplaining the majority at least of our considered convictions about\njustice \u2013 beliefs that we feel confident in holding about what\njustice requires us to do in a wide and varied range of circumstances\n(for Rawls\u2019 version of the test see the entry on\n reflective equilibrium).\n So unless we are willing to jettison many of these convictions in\norder to uphold one or other general framework, we will need to accept\nthat no comprehensive theory of justice is available to us; we will\nhave to make do with partial theories \u2013 theories about what\njustice requires in particular domains of human life. Rawls himself,\ndespite the bold title of his first book (A Theory of\nJustice), came to recognize that what he had outlined was at best\na theory of social justice applied to the basic institutional\nstructure of a modern liberal state. Other forms of justice \u2013\nfamilial, allocative, associational, international \u2013 with their\nassociated principles would be applicable in their respective domains\n(for an even more explicitly pluralist account of justice, see Walzer\n1983; for a fuller defence of a contextual approach to justice, see\nMiller 2013, esp. ch. 2).\n\nOne way to loosen up our thinking about justice is by paying greater\nattention to the history of the concept. We can learn a great deal by\nreading what Aristotle, or Aquinas, or Hume, has to say about the\nconcept, but as we do so, we also see that elements we would expect to\nfind are missing (there is nothing about rights in Aristotle,\nfor example), while others that we would not anticipate are present.\nThis may in some part be due to the idiosyncrasies of each thinker,\nbut more importantly it reflects differences in the form of social\nlife in which each was embedded \u2013 its economic, legal and\npolitical structure, especially. Various attempts have been made to\nwrite histories of justice that are more than just catalogues of what\nindividual thinkers have said: they aim to trace and explain\nsystematic shifts in the way that justice has been interpreted (for\ncontrasting examples, see MacIntyre 1988, Fleischacker 2004, Johnston\n2011). These should not be read as enlightenment stories in which our\nunderstanding of justice steadily improves as the centuries roll by.\nMacIntyre\u2019s view, for example, is that modern liberal societies\ncannot sustain the practices within which notions of justice find\ntheir proper home. We can get a better grasp of what justice means to\nus by seeing the various conceptions that compete for our attention as\ntied to aspects of our social world that did not exist in the past,\nand are equally liable to disappear in the future.\n",
