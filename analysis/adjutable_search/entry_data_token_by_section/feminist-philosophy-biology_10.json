    "main_text": "Conceptual Themes in Feminist Philosophy of Biology || Pluralism\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nThere are at least three areas in which feminist philosophy of\nbiology can be fruitfully developed. First, it is striking that\nthere are many topics that feminist and non-feminist philosophers of\nbiology both address, but there is often a paucity of interactions\nbetween these two bodies of literature. For example, reductionism\nis a central area of investigation in both fields, and in both fields\nthere is generally an anti-reductionist consensus, yet feminist and\nnon-feminist philosophers of biology rarely cite each others'\nwork (for an exception see Dupr\u00e9 2001). There is a wide range of\nanti-reductionist arguments on which feminists could draw and\nnon-feminists can be aided by careful considerations of the social and\npolitical impact of reductionism. More interaction between these\ngroups of scholars could be mutually beneficial. \n\n\nSecond, there is room for further integrating feminist philosophy of\nbiology with feminist epistemology and philosophy of science.\nFeminist philosophy of biology includes a vast body of literature\ndocumenting the impact of sexism and androcentrism in both the practice\nof biology and the knowledge produced by biologists. There are\nsignificant opportunities to further develop this work in light of\nadvances in feminist and social epistemology. For example, it\nwould be interesting to consider many of the feminist criticisms of\ngender bias in biology from the perspective of social accounts of\nknowledge production or using Haraway's notion of situated\nknowledges.\n\n\nFinally, there are opportunities to develop feminist analyses on a\nwide range of topics in the biological sciences. These include\nmore contemporary scientific research on topics covered by classic\nworks in feminist philosophy of biology. For example Anne\nFausto-Sterling (1992) and Ruth Bleier (1984) critiqued research on\nsexual selection, and related work in sociobiology and evolutionary\npsychology, for focusing on individual sperm as a unit for determining\nthe male contribution to reproduction. Since then biological research\non sexual selection and Darwinian feminist approaches to sociobiology\nand evolutionary ecology (although little in evolutionary psychology)\nhave addressed this issue. There are opportunities for feminist\nphilosophers of biology to engage this shift in scientific research\nfocus. Opportunities also exist for feminist philosophy of\nbiology to analyze other topics and groups of researchers in the\nbiological sciences, including Darwinian feminist research on life\nhistory strategies and the evolution of male and female reproductive\nstrategies. Finally there are opportunities to develop feminist\nanalyses of topics that are relatively new such as research on genomics\nas it relates to gender (see the work Evelyn Fox Keller 2000).\nIn all of these areas of investigation there is room to ask questions\nabout the efficacy of the relevant scientific practices at producing\nmaximally accurate representations of gender as well as epistemic\nquestions rooted in recent work in feminist epistemology.\n",
