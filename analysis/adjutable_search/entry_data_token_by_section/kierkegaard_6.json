Trajectories in Kierkegaard Scholarship\n\nThe vast range of Kierkegaard\u2019s influences makes the task of\nsummarizing the most important secondary literature close to\nimpossible. For the literature selected would depend upon which\napproaches to Kierkegaard the author finds most fruitful. In this\nsection, we aim to sketch some key trajectories of interpretation,\ngiving sample references of each kind of approach.\n\nOne axis along which Kierkegaard commentators may be divided is\nbetween those for whom the primary task in understanding Kierkegaard\ninvolves locating him accurately in his historical context (e.g.,\nunderstanding his complex relationship to German idealism and\nromanticism, and to contemporaries such as the Danish Hegelian Hans\nLassen Martensen), and those for whom Kierkegaard is interesting\nprimarily because of the ability his texts have to contribute to\nissues of more recent or contemporary interest (philosophical;\ntheological; literary; social or political; etc.). An excellent\nexample of the former approach would be much of the work of Jon\nStewart. For many years, Niels Thulstrup\u2019s\nKierkegaard\u2019s Relation to Hegel (1967 [1980]) was\nthought to have decisively shown that Kierkegaard took little from\nHegel. However, Stewart\u2019s Kierkegaard\u2019s Relations to\nHegel Reconsidered (2003)\u2014note the plural in the\ntitle\u2014argues convincingly that many of the targets Kierkegaard\nhad in mind in his attacks on Hegelianism were Danish followers of\nHegel who may have misunderstood or misapplied Hegel in significant\nways. Thus, Kierkegaard\u2019s relation to Hegel is much more complex\nand nuanced than has sometimes been thought. Stewart aims to show that\nKierkegaard was responding specifically to debates in 1830s and 1840s\nDenmark about Hegel\u2019s philosophy (especially its significance\nfor theology), a milieu in which Martensen was a crucial\nfigure.\n\nThis does not mean, nor does Stewart claim, that there are no\ndisagreements between Kierkegaard and Hegel. Stewart divides the\nKierkegaard corpus into three main periods: up to and including\nEither/Or (where Kierkegaard is most open to Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy); from Fear and Trembling to the\nPostscript (where the attacks on \u201cHegelianism\u201d\nare most pronounced and polemical); and Works of Love\nonwards, where the waning of Hegel\u2019s influence in Denmark means\nthat Kierkegaard\u2019s criticism diminishes. Here a certain positive\ninfluence of Hegel re-emerges, for example in the method of The\nSickness Unto Death.\n\nCritics have disagreed as to whether Stewart\u2019s analysis closes\nthe gap between Kierkegaard and Hegel excessively, for instance\nregarding the two figures\u2019 different views of the relationship\nbetween philosophy and religion. One central issue concerns the proper\nattitude of the philosopher. As we have noted, Kierkegaard opposes a\nkind of disengaged \u201cobjective\u201d standpoint, while Hegel at\nleast in some places maintains that such an attitude is necessary for\nphilosophy to be \u201cscientific\u201d. Hegel famously claims that\n\u201cphilosophy should beware of the wish to be edifying\u201d\n(Hegel 1977: 6; originally published 1807), which seems directly\ncontrary to the Kierkegaardian claim at the end of Either/Or\nII: \u201cOnly the truth that edifies is truth for you\u201d\n(EO II, 354, translation modified/ SKS 3,331). Another point of\ntension is the Hegelian aim to produce a \u201csystem\u201d\nencompassing the whole of reality, whereas Kierkegaard\u2019s\npseudonym Johannes Climacus insists that a system of existence is\nimpossible for anyone but God (CUP I, 118\u2013125/SKS 7, 114\n-120).\n\nStewart later went on to become general editor of a monumental series:\nKierkegaard Research: Sources, Reception, and Resources,\nwhich includes a huge amount of work of this historically oriented\ntype (amongst others). Michelle Kosch\u2019s work on Kierkegaard in\nrelation to German idealism (Kosch 2006) is another exemplary instance\nof historically oriented work, while Fred Rush\u2019s book on\nKierkegaard in relation to romanticism (esp. Schlegel) and idealism\n(esp. Hegel) also provides helpful historical context (Rush 2016).\n\nExamples of the less historically oriented type of Kierkegaard\nscholarship are highly varied. Some have looked to Kierkegaard as a\nkind of proto-Derrida, a deconstructionist avant la lettre\n(e.g., Poole 1993; for an overview of deconstructionist and\npostmodernist readings of Kierkegaard which does not conflate the two,\nsee Shakespeare 2013). Similarly, the question has been raised as to\nwhether Kierkegaard can plausibly be read as a proto-phenomenologist\ndespite preceding Husserl (e.g., Hanson 2010; see also Welz 2013).\nOthers have seen some intriguing commonalities between Kierkegaard and\nWittgenstein, either the Tractatus or later writings,\nsometimes focusing on the ostensibly narrow but (it is claimed)\nultimately deeply significant question of how we should read the\n\u201crevocation\u201d of the Postscript, and what this\nreveals about the proper method of philosophy with regard to religious\nquestions (e.g., Cavell 1969; Conant 1989, 1993, 1995; Lippitt &\nHutto 1998; Phillips 1999; Mulhall 2001; Sch\u00f6nbaumsfeld 2007).\nMacIntyre\u2019s claims about Kierkegaard\u2019s proper place in the\nhistory of philosophy\u2014allegedly, as a critical figure in the\nfailure of the Enlightenment\u2019s attempt to offer a rational\njustification of morality\u2014spawned a veritable scholarly\nsub-industry, not only aiming to show where MacIntyre was wrong in his\ninterpretation of Kierkegaard, but of how Kierkegaard in fact\nanticipated many highly MacIntyrean themes. As noted above, a central\nfocus of debate has been whether Kierkegaard may be read\u2014like\nMacIntyre\u2014as a proponent of a narrative-based account of\npractical identity, where a \u201cnarrative structure\u201d is\nneeded to make a human life intelligible, actions and intentions\nneeding to be located in a temporal, social and teleological context\nin order to be understood. However, this may be seen as part of a\nbroader school of interpretation, which finds some intriguing\nparallels between Kierkegaard and several major recent anglophone\nmoral philosophers. Besides MacIntyre, these would include Harry\nFrankfurt (see, e.g., Mooney 1996, esp. 65\u201376 and the essays in\nRudd and Davenport 2015); Iris Murdoch (e.g., Martens 2012); Charles\nTaylor (e.g., Khan 2012) and Bernard Williams (e.g., Mooney 1996, esp.\n65\u201376, Compaijen 2018). The shift in moral philosophy during the\nlater decades of the twentieth century and into the\ntwenty-first\u2014from mid-1900s concerns about the nature of ethical\nlanguage and debates about realism versus anti-realism in ethics, to\nbroader concerns about what makes human lives meaningful, the nature\nof human flourishing, and the moral psychology of the\nvirtues\u2014has been seen by many Kierkegaard scholars as a move\n(albeit mostly an unwitting one) in the direction of more\n\u201cKierkegaardian\u201d concerns. Within this school of\ninterpretation, some key claims have been that Kierkegaard holds a\nteleological view of the self; a belief that the quest for\n\u201cnarrative unity\u201d is an important element in achieving\nethical selfhood; and a rich view of the virtues (Davenport and Rudd\n2001; Davenport 2012; Rudd 2012). Even skeptics about the second view\n(e.g., Lippitt 2007, 2015b) have tended to agree on the first and\nthird.\n\nAnother major fault line in Kierkegaard scholarship concerns the\ndivide between scholars who take Kierkegaard\u2019s Christian\ncommitments seriously and those who find them something of an\nembarrassment, and whose approach to the texts seems to be to ask what\ncan be salvaged despite these commitments. The former approach is\nexemplified in much of the work of Evans (1983, 1992, 2009, 2019),\nwhich has consistently tried to show that Kierkegaard\u2019s writings\ncan be helpful in making sense of the religious life in general and\nChristianity in particular. The latter type of work has sometimes\ntaken the form of reading Kierkegaard \u201cagainst\nKierkegaard\u201d (e.g., Adorno 1933 [1989], Theunissen 1993 [2005]).\nFinally, quite a bit of work has also been done on Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview of women and gender (see for instance Walsh 2022.)\n",
