    "preamble": "\n\nEpist\u00eam\u00ea is the Greek word most often translated\nas knowledge, while techn\u00ea is translated as either\ncraft or art. These translations, however, may inappropriately harbor\nsome of our contemporary assumptions about the relation between theory\n(the domain of \u2018knowledge\u2019) and practice (the concern of\n\u2018craft\u2019 or \u2018art\u2019). In our era, the paradigm of\ntheory is pure mathematics, that has no obvious application to\npractical problems of, e.g., engineering. As well, theoretical physics\nsometimes has a tenuous relation to confirming/disconfirming\nexperimentation. At the other end of the spectrum is craft, for\nexample, carpentry, which is so enmeshed in material application that\nit resists any general explanation but must be learned by practice. As\na consequence, theory and practice even seem irreconcilable. Outside\nof modern science, there is sometimes skepticism about the relevance\nof theory to practice because it is thought that theory is conducted\nat so great a remove from the facts, the province of practice, that it\ncan lose touch with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concrete\nexperience might be all we need. Finally, if the practical is widened\nto include more than the way we manipulate the physical world but also\nthe way we lead our lives, the relation between theory and practice\nhas another problematic aspect. Within science, theory strives for a\nvalue-free view of reality. As a consequence, scientific theory cannot\ntell us how things should be or how to lead our lives. This contrast\npresents another aspect of the difference between theory and practice;\npure theory is removed from ethical investigation and the practice of\nliving requires it.\n However, in what follows we will see that some of\nthe features of this contemporary distinction between theory and\npractice are not found in the relation between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea. Others are\nfound in a somewhat refracted fashion. As we move chronologically from\nXenophon to Plotinus, we go from an author who does not distinguish\nbetween the two terms, to an author who has little use for\ntechn\u00ea because it is so far from what he considers to\nbe real. It is in Aristotle that we find the basis for something like\nthe modern opposition between epist\u00eam\u00ea as pure\ntheory and techn\u00ea as practice. Yet even Aristotle\nrefers to techn\u00ea or craft as itself also\nepist\u00eam\u00ea or knowledge because it is a practice\ngrounded in an \u2018account\u2019 \u2014 something involving\ntheoretical understanding. Plato \u2014 whose theory of forms seems\nan arch example of pure theoretical knowledge \u2014 nevertheless is\nfascinated by the idea of a kind of techn\u00ea that is\ninformed by knowledge of forms. In the Republic this\nknowledge is the indispensable basis for the philosophers\u2019 craft\nof ruling in the city. Picking up another theme in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, the Stoics develop the idea that virtue is a kind of\ntechn\u00ea or craft of life, one that is based on an\nunderstanding of the universe. The relation, then, between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea in ancient\nphilosophy offers an interesting contrast with our own notions about\ntheory (pure knowledge) and (experience-based) practice. There is an\nintimate positive relationship between epist\u00eam\u00ea\nand techn\u00ea, as well as a fundamental contrast.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Xenophon\n\nXenophon\u2019s only sustained discussions of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea are in two of\nhis Socratic works, Memorabilia and Oeconomicus. The\nMemorabilia recounts conversations which Socrates held on a\nvariety of topics; the Oeconomicus is a conversation largely\ndevoted to one, i.e., the art of running a successful estate and\nhousehold. In these works, knowledge is intimately tied to knowing how\nto do things, especially the more organized kind of knowing-how\ndesignated by techn\u00ea. There is no distinction between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea as theoretical knowledge and\ntechn\u00ea as mere craft or skill. Socrates explicitly\nidentifies as technai such activities as playing the harp,\ngeneralship, piloting a ship, cooking, medicine, managing an estate,\nsmithing, and carpentry; by association with these technai,\nwe can include housebuilding, mathematics, astronomy, making money,\nflute playing, and painting. Without marking any difference, he also\ncalls many of these activities epist\u00eamai.\n\nAt the beginning of Memorabilia, Xenophon, in fact, portrays\nSocrates as uninterested in the abstract investigations of the\nphysical philosophers. Socrates, he says, eschewed the investigation\nof the kosmos; he preferred looking into human affairs.\nBesides, humans cannot understand the universe, as shown by the\ninability of those who engage in these kinds of study to agree\n(I.i.11\u201314). In fact, towards the end of the work, Xenophon says\nthat Socrates held that the study of geometry should be pursued to the\npoint where one could measure a parcel of land he meant to buy; study\nof more complicated figures he disparaged because he did not see the\nuse of it (IV.vii.3). If after this introduction we did not expect to\nfind a very great difference between epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea, we would not be disappointed.\n\nAlmost all occurrences of the word\n\u2018epist\u00eam\u00ea\u2019 show its close connection\nto skill, practice, and techn\u00ea. In a jocular vein,\nCritoboulos says he wants to gain the knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) which will allow him to win over those\nwith good souls and beautiful bodies (II.vi.30). Socrates compares the\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) of justice to the knowledge\nof letters, i.e., a skill (IV.ii.20). As well, the verb\nepistasthai \u2014 the root of epist\u00eam\u00ea\n\u2014 carries the sense of knowing how to do something. The stronger\nknow how to use (chr\u00easthai) the weaker like slaves\n(II.i.12\u201313). If one does not know how to pilot (m\u00ea\nepistamen\u00f4(i) kubern\u00e2n) a ship \u2014 a\ntechn\u00ea \u2014 both he and his ship will be lost\n(II.vi.38). One must learn the crafts (technai) of war from\none who knows them (epistamenon) (II.i.28). Socrates says\nthat some of the sub-skills of generalship \u2014 which elsewhere he\ncalls a techn\u00ea \u2014 come by nature and others come\nthrough knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) (III.i.6\u20137).\nThe difference is between what is not acquired and what is acquired;\nbut we find no distinction \u2014 as in Plato \u2014 between what is\nacquired by teaching and what is acquired by training. Thus Xenophon\ndoes not make the Platonic distinction between theoretical instruction\nand learning by practice (cf. Meno 70a\u2013b).\n\nSocrates emphasizes that learning an epist\u00eam\u00ea\n\u2014 what we would call a field of knowledge \u2014 entails care,\ndiligence, and practice. He says that idleness does not put knowledge\nworthy of mention into the soul; one must also have care or diligence\n(epimeleia) for doing fine and good deeds (II.i.20). Free men\n(actually gentlemen farmers) who are not idle but exercise diligence\n(epimelomenous) in those useful things they understand\n(epistantai) are happiest; work and application\n(epimeleian) help men to learn what they need to know and to\nremember what they learn (II.vii.7\u20138). Near the beginning of the\nMemorabilia, Socrates argues against those who say that a\njust man can never become unjust. Rather, he says, those who do not\ntrain the soul (askountas) cannot carry out the functions of\nthe soul (I.ii.19\u201320). Diligence and training, then, are the\nbasis of these skills, not a theoretical grasp of principles.\n\nEven at his most theoretical, Xenophon\u2019s Socrates shows a\npractical bent. Saying that those who know what each virtue is can\nexpound these to others, he gives definitions for the virtues. A pious\nman, for instance, knows the laws respecting the worship of the gods\nand thus worships the gods lawfully; and, in general, the man who\nknows what is lawful with respect to the gods (ta peri tous theous\nnomima eid\u00f4s) is pious (IV.vi.1\u20134). The pious man,\nthen, is defined by informed religious practice. The most abstract\ndefinition would seem to be that of wisdom. Claiming the wise are wise\nby knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea(i)), Socrates says wisdom\nis knowledge. Next, however, he cautions that no one can know all\nthings; so a person is wise to the extent that he knows (IV.vi.7).\nKnowledge, then, can be accumulated. Since knowledge is divided into\nvarious skills, such as managing an estate and generalship, and their\nsubdivisions, the wise man would appear to be someone who acquires as\nmuch of this kind of knowledge as possible. If so, he is a person of\nwide accomplishments, not someone with a theory about the\nuniverse.\n\nThroughout the Memorabilia, Xenophon weaves the theme of the\ncraft of ruling (basilik\u00ea techn\u00ea).  This craft is the finest of\nvirtues and technai, by which men, public and private, become\ncapable of ruling and benefiting other men and themselves (IV.ii.11).\nKings and rulers are not simply those who are chosen but those who\nknow how to rule (tous epistamenous archein). In this regard\nthey are compared to others who exercise a techn\u00ea, such\nas ship\u2019s pilots (III.ix.10\u201311). A good king does not just\nmanage his own life well but also that of the ones he rules and he is\nthe cause of their happiness (III.ii.2\u20133). However, he also\nargues that rulers have a more pleasant life than those who are ruled.\nHis interlocutor, Aristippus, takes him to be claiming that the ruling\ncraft is happiness. In answer, Socrates describes the life of what is\nobviously a gentleman, capable of winning good friends and subduing\nenemies, fit in body and soul to manage his household, to help his\nfriends, and serve his country (II.i.19\u201320). These constitute\nthe happy life of the gentleman; they also make him able to make\nothers happy (IV.i.2\u20133). Although\nruling is associated with happiness (eudaimonia), Socrates is\nnot tempted to generalize about happiness; instead of an account of happiness,\nhe enumerates the activities of a flourishing member of the\ndominant class.\n\nIn the Oeconomicus, Socrates uses knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and craft (techn\u00ea)\ninterchangeably to refer to the practical undertakings of a gentleman,\ncalled in Greek kalos k\u2019agathos \u2014 literally one\nwho is fine and good. He opens the work with the question whether\nestate management (oikonomia) is the name of a type of\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) like medicine, smithing, and\ncarpentry. Then he asks whether he and his interlocutor can say what\nthe function (ergon) of estate management is, just as they\ncan say what are the functions of these other technai\n(I.1\u20132). When he uses epist\u00eam\u00ea in what\nfollows, the focus of his discussion is some aspect of estate or\nhousehold management. He refers indifferently to the knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and the craft (techn\u00ea)\nof estate management and of farming; the latter includes sub-skills\nsuch as breeding stock (V.3) casting seed (XVII.7) and the planting of\ntrees (XIX.1). However, there is a distinction between illiberal arts\n(banausikai technai) and those worthy of a gentleman. The\nlatter are the craft of war (polemik\u00ea\ntechn\u00ea) and that of farming (ge\u00f4rgia).\nThe illiberal arts confine one to the workshop and narrow one\u2019s\ninterests to his own welfare; the crafts of war and farming give one a\nwider scope so that he can attend to his friends and city\n(IV.2\u20134; VI.5\u20139). In fact, farming is the mother and nurse\nof the other technai (V.17). However, knowledge by itself is\nnot sufficient to prosper. There are those who have the knowledge and\nresources to increase their estates but are unwilling to do so (I.16).\nOthers, like Socrates\u2019 respondent Critoboulos, might gain such\nknowledge but do not have the wealth necessary to make use of it\n(II.11\u201313). Still, Socrates says, knowledge is not sufficient to\nprofit but one also needs care and diligence in order to put his\nknowledge into effect (XX.2\u20136). This unused knowledge is not\nuntried theory but neglected skill.\n2. Plato\n\nIn Plato\u2019s dialogues the relation between knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and craft or skill\n(techn\u00ea) is complex and surprising. There is no general\nand systematic account of either but rather overlapping treatments,\nreflecting the context of different dialogues. Nevertheless, Plato\nemphasizes certain characteristics of both that demonstrate a\nsustained and consistent engagement with the two concepts.\n\nThroughout the dialogues characters frequently cite\ntechn\u00ea as a way of illustrating important points in\ntheir philosophical conversations. Some crafts mentioned are medicine,\nhorsemanship, huntsmanship, oxherding, farming, calculation, geometry,\ngeneralship, piloting a ship, chariot-driving, political craft,\nprophecy, music, lyre-playing, flute-playing, painting, sculpture,\nhousebuilding, shipbuilding, carpentry, weaving, pottery, smithing,\nand cookery. Each of these activities is associated with the word\ntechn\u00ea, e.g., medicine with the iatrik\u00ea\ntechn\u00ea. Each is also associated with a practitioner, e.g.,\nmedicine with a physician (iatros). Other crafts are\nmentioned but without practitioners, e.g., arithmetic, flute-making,\nand sorcery. Socrates uses medicine much more than any other\ntechn\u00ea; other crafts repeatedly mentioned, albeit less\nfrequently than medicine, are house-building, weaving, political\ncraft, music, shoemaking, piloting a ship, generalship, prophecy,\ncarpentry, farming, horsemanship, flute-playing. To our contemporary\nears this list is quite various; it is hard to think that they all\nhave any interesting characteristics in common. Such crafts, or\ntechnai, as farming and building have concrete, inanimate\nproducts. Horse training and huntsmanship care for animate but\nnon-human beings. Medicine cares for the health of humans. Calculation\nhas neither a concrete product nor does it provide care.\n\nIn some dialogues, craft (techn\u00ea) and knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) seem interchangeable in much the same\nway as in Xenophon\u2019s Socratic dialogues. In the\nCharmides (165c) Socrates says that medicine, i.e., the\nphysician\u2019s craft (iatrik\u00ea techn\u00ea), is the\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) of health. In\nEuthydemus (281a) Socrates says that what guides right use of\nmaterials in carpentry is the knowledge of carpentry\n(techtonik\u00ea epist\u00eam\u00ea). In\nIon (532c) Socrates tells the rhapsode Ion that he is not\nable to talk about Homer with craft and knowledge. In\nProtagoras (356d-e) Socrates refers to measuring as both a\ncraft and a kind of knowledge.\n\nHowever, Plato\u2019s interest in techn\u00ea is not\ninnocent. He uses the notion as a way of explicating central themes,\nsuch as virtue, ruling, and the creation of the cosmos. As a\nconsequence, he develops a complex account of techn\u00ea.\nFirst of all, a craft has a function (ergon); this is what it\ncharacteristically does or what it characteristically accomplishes. In\nfact, crafts are differentiated by their specific functions\n(erga)(Rep. 346a). A similar idea is assumed in the\nexchange between Dionysiodorus and Socrates (Euthydemus\n301c), as it is by Socrates in Euthyphro (13d) and\nIon (537c). While the ergon of a craft is its goal,\nthe goal is frequently identified with a result separate from the\nactivity of the craft. In the Euthydemus (291e) the goal\n(ergon) of medicine is health just as food is the goal\n(ergon) of farming. When in the Charmides (165e)\nCritias denies that calculation has an ergon, in the way that\na house is the ergon of building or a garment of weaving,\nSocrates answers that nevertheless calculation is about the odd and\nthe even. His answer suggests the possibility of a\ntechn\u00ea whose goal is not a separate result \u2014 an\nidea to be found in the Statesman. Still in the\nGorgias (453e\u2013454a) Socrates argues that calculation produces\nas its ergon persuasion about the amount of the odd and the\neven \u2014 a result separate from the activity of calculation.\n\nAs the concept of techn\u00ea develops, the role of\nreflective knowledge is emphasized. Whereas techn\u00ea is\nassociated with knowing how to do (epistasthai) certain\nactivities, epist\u00eam\u00ea sometimes indicates a\ntheoretical component of techn\u00ea. For example, the\nphysician knows how to care for the sick (Rep. 342d), to\nprescribe a regimen (Rep. 407d), to provide for the advantage\nof the body (Rep. 341e), to make someone healthy\n(Charm. 174c), to make someone vomit (Laws 933b).\nHowever, the epist\u00eam\u00ea associated with craft means\nmore than simply how to do certain activities. The physician knows or\nrecognizes (gign\u00f4skein) health by medical knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) (Charm. 170c). Since health\nis the goal of the medical craft, the physician understands the goal\nof the craft. Plato emphasizes this knowledge as a distinct aspect of\nthe craftsman\u2019s skill. Sometimes this aspect is theoretical in\nthe root sense of the\u00f4ria \u2014 looking. In the\nCratylus (389a\u2013b) Socrates talks about the carpenter who\nmakes the weaver\u2019s shuttle; he looks to (blep\u00f4n)\nsomething whose nature is to weave. This latter seems to be a material\nmodel because Socrates supposes what would happen if it were to break.\nIn that case, the carpenter looks to the form (eidos) of\nshuttle, that which is shuttle (ho estin kerkis). In the\nGorgias (503d-e) all craftsmen work not at random but look\ntoward the goal of their craft (ergon) so that what each\nproduces will have a certain form. Socrates cites painters,\nhousebuilders, and shipbuilders. In Republic VI Socrates\ncompares philosophers who are rulers to painters who look to a model\n(484c).\n\nThe theoretical aspect is also expressed as articulate reasoning about\nthe goal. In Plato\u2019s view, the ability to explain why he does\nwhat he does is one of the most important characteristics of the\ncraftsman. In the Charmides, Socrates says that we test the\nphysician by questioning him since he understands health\n(Charm. 170e5\u20137). Expanding on the idea of testing,\nSocrates says they will investigate the physician in what he says and\nin what he does, on whether what he says is true and whether what he\ndoes is right (171b7\u20139). This theoretical side of craft is\nfurther developed in the Gorgias. In his conversation with\nPolus and later in his conversation with Callicles, Socrates carries\non a sustained reflection about craft. In his conversation with Polus,\nSocrates distinguishes four crafts (technai: medicine,\nphysical training, judging, and legislating; the first pair are\nconcerned with the body and the latter with the soul (464b). These\ncrafts provide their care always for the best, either of the body or\nof the soul (464c). Unlike empiric practice (empeiria),\ntechn\u00ea has an account to give by which it provides the\nthings it provides, an account of what their nature is, so that it can\nsay the cause of each (465a). In the conversation with Callicles,\nSocrates returns to this account, when he seems especially interested\nin the ability of techn\u00ea to give an account. He says\nmedical techn\u00ea investigates the nature of the thing it\ncares for (therapeuei) and the cause of what it does and has\nan account to give of each of them (501a). In the first instance,\nmedicine cares for, or treats, the body; but, more particularly, it\ncares for the good of the body, i.e., its health. So, this\ntechn\u00ea has an account to give of health and of what it\ndoes to achieve the end of health.\n\nSo far then, a craft is defined by its goal and is a kind of\nknowledge. Fully developed, this knowledge is knowing how to\naccomplish a goal on the basis of an understanding of the goal; the\nunderstanding can be articulated in an account. The account informs\nand guides the skilled practice. A craftsman\u2019s being able to\narticulate the goal is most fully developed, perhaps, in the\nLaws. The Athenian Stranger describes the distinction between\nthe slave doctor and the doctor of free men as resting on the ability\nto give an account. The slave doctor relies on experience\n(empeiria) and has no account to give for his procedure. The\nfree doctor not only has an account, he communicates it to his\npatients as a way of eliciting their cooperation in the course of\ntreatment (720 b\u2013d). Presumably, the patients come to appreciate the\nreasons for the actions the doctor undertakes as well as the regimen\nhe prescribes because they better understand the nature of health and\nthe way the treatments produce health. In fact, the empiric doctor\nlaughs at the free doctor for instructing his patients \u2014 as\nthough he were trying to make them into doctors themselves (857\nd-e).\n\nThere is a second feature of techn\u00ea that is vital for\nunderstanding its importance to Plato. In the Gorgias,\ntechn\u00ea is distinguished from empeiria not only\nby its ability to give an account but also because it seeks the\nwelfare of its object. The physician and the physical trainer seek the\nwelfare of the body, just as the judge and the legislator seek the\nwelfare of the soul (464c). These features of techn\u00ea\nfigure in one of Plato\u2019s persistent themes, the knowledge needed\nto rule the city. One of its most important occurrences is in the\nRepublic, where Socrates characterizes ruling as a kind of\ntechn\u00ea that looks out after the welfare of the city\n(Rep. 342e). But in other dialogues as well, the authentic\nruler has a knowledge, both practical and theoretical, that allows him\nto achieve what is good for the city. In fact, the passage just cited\nfrom the Laws is part of an analogy to explain why the\nlegislator should be able to explain to the citizens the reasons\nbehind the law, and presumably why the law is good for the city.\n\nIndeed, most accounts of knowledge in the dialogues are carried out in\nthe context of such discussions. Even in the Theaetetus, the\ndialogue most often thought of as dedicated to epistemology, we find\nthe same theme. When he argues against Protagoras\u2019 relativism,\nSocrates gets the sophist to concede that some people are wiser than\nothers when it comes to what is good for the city (167c\u2013d). Socrates\nthen seizes upon an analogy with medicine. While each person may be\nthe final authority for himself when it comes to what is hot, dry, and\nsweet for him, in matters of health and disease not everyone knows the\nhealthy for himself nor is he able to cure himself. Just so, while\nProtagoras may hold that for each city what is fine or base, just or\nunjust, pious or impious is what the city takes it to be, what is\nreally advantageous for the city is not the same as what it takes to\nbe advantageous (171e \u2013 172b). Although Socrates\u2019\ninvestigation of knowledge becomes more abstract when he introduces\nbeing, not-being, likeness and unlikeness, identity and difference,\nunity and plurality, to this group he adds the fine and the base, the\ngood and the bad (185c\u2013186a). The soul itself investigates these\nthings, trying to determine their being (ousia) and their\nopposition to one another and the being of that opposition. Finally,\nthe investigation of being, non-being and the other opposites \u2014\nincluding the fine and the base, the good and the bad \u2014 also\nreflects both on the being of each and on its usefulness (pros te\nousian kai \u00f4pheleian) (186c).While Socrates does not\nexplain what reflecting on their usefulness amounts to, the remark\nshows a link, however slight, to the original motivation for the\ninvestigation of knowledge\u2014 i.e., providing what is really\nadvantageous for the city.\n\nNevertheless, these passages from the Theaetetus draw our\nattention to a change in the notion of epist\u00eam\u00ea.\nKnowledge of the forms tends to become an end in itself; and in this\nway the idea of knowledge as pure theory begins to make an appearance\nin the dialogues. This tension is also prominent in the\nRepublic, of course, where Socrates introduces and develops\nthe notion that rulers should be philosophers, who are defined by\ntheir knowledge of forms. At the beginning of the discussion of\nphilosophical rulers in Republic IV, knowledge and craft fall\ninto a familiar pattern of interchangeability. After defining the\nthree classes in the city, Socrates is looking for the knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) in virtue of which the city is\nwell-counseled. He dismisses the crafts of carpentry, smithing, and\nfarming \u2014 obviously crafts and called epist\u00eamai\n(428b\u2013c). While these focus on some partial good for the city, the\nepist\u00eam\u00ea of ruling takes counsel for the city as\na whole and what is best for it internally and externally (428 b\u2013d).\nThen, in Republic V, Socrates introduces an altogether\ndifferent notion of the knowledge that philosophers will have \u2014\none whose object is forms. Indeed this passage defines for most\nreaders Plato\u2019s idea of epist\u00eam\u00ea.\n\nKnowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) is the ability to know the\nreal as it is (477b). The context shows that when Socrates talks about\nthe real, he is referring to the forms. In the Republic, the\nprominent forms are the forms for the beautiful, the good, and the\njust. In the Symposium, Socrates describes the form of the\nbeautiful as neither coming to be nor passing away, as not changing in\nany other way, as never being or even appearing to anyone as anything\nbut beautiful (211a\u2013b). Since an analogous description applies to the\ngood and the just, one can see that forms are very different from the\nsorts of things we experience through the sensory perception\nassociated with the usual technai. After forms are introduced\nin the Republic, they are the objects of the most abstract\nand highest knowledge, afforded by the power of dialectic. At the end\nof Book VI, Socrates uses the words for knowledge that we have found\nin other contexts\u2014 understanding (gn\u00f4sis) and\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea). However, in the Divided\nLine passage a new vocabulary is introduced, as though the conception\nof knowledge has changed in a fundamental way. As he has in other\nplaces, Socrates divides the visible world (horaton) from the\nintelligible (no\u00eaton). Whereas before the intelligible\nhad been the undivided field of gn\u00f4sis and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, now it is subdivided into the fields of\nmathematical or deductive reasoning (dianoia) and the\ngrasping of the unhypothetical beginning point (nous). The\nlatter is the goal of dialectic (511a\u2013b).\n\nLater in Republic VI there is a connection\u2014of a\ndifferent sort\u2014between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. Knowledge, in the sense of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, will be deductive and logical like\nmathematics; unlike mathematics, its deductions will be based on\nfoundations that need no further justification. In part it will be\nsomething like mathematical deduction based on fundamental reality. Two\naspects of this account are significant. First, using a mathematical\nmodel as the root of this conception of knowledge makes it purely\ntheoretical; it is theoretical because, like calculation in the\nCharmides (165e), it has no separate product. Its\nergon seems to be the activity itself of dialectical thought.\nSecond, in using mathematical thinking as an analogue for dialectic,\nSocrates is still relying on the notion of techn\u00ea since\nboth geometry and calculation are technai. \n\nNevertheless, in the Divided Line, Socrates posits intelligible\nentities, abstract but real, as objects of mathematical thought and of\ndialectical knowledge. Although it treats them only as hypotheses,\nmathematics reasons about the odd and the even, the various kinds of\nshapes, and the three kinds of angles. These are entities distinct\nfrom their perceptual representation in material diagrams. In turn,\ndialectic does not treat forms as hypotheses but comes to know what\neach is. This knowledge comes from grasping their relation to the\nunhypothetical beginning point, the form of the good (509d-511e). The\nsuper-eminence of the knowledge of the good leads to the\nlatter\u2019s becoming an end in itself. When philosophers, after\nyears of study, at last see the good, they would prefer to stay at\nthis level and not go back down into the city to rule. They must be\nforced, by argument, to undertake the task of applying their knowledge\nof the forms to the affairs of ruling (519c\u2013520e). So, when this\naccount introduces abstract but real entities as objects of knowledge,\nSocrates comes close to giving theoretical knowledge a sphere of\nactivity that is distinct from that of practical knowledge.\n\nNevertheless, even though epist\u00eam\u00ea is tied to\nforms, it still has a role in techn\u00ea. First, at the\nbeginning of Republic VI, Socrates gives his interlocutors a\npeculiar description of what the philosopher will do with this\nknowledge of reality. Converting Socrates\u2019 negative description\nof the non-philosopher, we find that the philosopher has a knowledge\n(gn\u00f4sis) of the reality of each form, thus a clear\nparadigm in his soul. Like painters, philosophers look to\n(apoblepontes) the truest paradigm, always referring to it\nand contemplating it as accurately as possible; in this way they\nestablish here the laws respecting the fine, the just, and the good,\nif there is need to establish them, or take care to preserve those\nthat are established (484c\u2013d). By comparing philosophers to painters\nwho imitate a paradigm, Socrates is giving to the knowledge of forms a\nrole within a kind of craft which imitates forms. This notion of\nimitating forms is an important one for Plato; he uses it again in the\naccount of creation in the Timaeus. At 28a, the Demiurge\n\u2014 the craftsman of the universe \u2014 looking at\n(blep\u00f4n) that which does not change and using it as a\nparadigm, fashions its form and power into his creation. In the\nsubsequent passage we learn that this unchanging paradigm is the\nintelligible animal that contains all other intelligible animals\n(30c\u2013d).\n\nBesides the contexts in which epist\u00eam\u00ea of forms\nresults in imitating them, the dialogues offer another important way\nof reconciling knowledge of forms and techn\u00ea. In the\nSophist, the Visitor from Elea elaborates an analogy between\ntechn\u00ea and dialectic, whose objects are clearly forms.\nHe begins with the idea that there is a techn\u00ea for\ntelling which letters join to which, just as there is\ntechn\u00ea for which musical notes mingle and which do not\n(253a ff). Then the Visitor turns to the kinds (gen\u00ea)\nthat he has just introduced: being, rest, motion, sameness, and\ndifference (254d-e). Making an analogy with the grammatical and\nmusical technai, he posits a sort of knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) for showing which kinds harmonize and\nwhich do not. This is also the knowledge of how to discriminate\naccording to kinds, which the Visitor calls dialectic. While this\nknowledge of how to distinguish and to harmonize forms is compared to\ncraft, it is not productive, the way carpentry is productive. However,\nin the Statesman, the Visitor takes up the relation of\ndialectic, conceived of as theoretical, with practical knowledge. He\ncontrasts epist\u00eamai that are practical \u2014 like\ncarpentry \u2014 and those which are for knowledge only (258d). The\nVisitor calls them respectively the practical\n(praktik\u00ea) and the theoretical\n(gn\u00f4stik\u00ea \u2014 clearly related to\ngn\u00f4sis and gign\u00f4skein)(259d). The\npractical epist\u00eamai cover what are otherwise called\ncrafts; however, the theoretical is subdivided into (a)\nepist\u00eamai like calculation, which only judges or\ndistinguishes the things known and (b) epist\u00eamai like\nthat of the architect (architekt\u00f4n), which command and\nare thus called commanding (epitaktik\u00ea) (259e). The\nVisitor may seem to have blurred his original distinction between\npractical and theoretical by including commanding knowledge\n(epitaktik\u00ea) in the latter category. Still, the notion\nthat at least part of theoretical knowledge only judges the things\nknown gives us a basis for distinguishing theoretical from practical\nknowledge. The former entails craft-like skill; but the skill remains\nfocused on the objects of knowledge. In calculation the objects are\nnumbers; in dialectic they are the kinds. This kind of knowledge has\nno product separate from its activity; by contrast, practical\nknowledge actually produces something separate, in the way carpentry\ndoes. This way of expressing the difference suggests that theoretical\nepist\u00eam\u00ea is not so much a body of knowledge as an\nability to grasp very abstract sorts of distinctions. \n\nStill, by including commanding knowledge, the Visitor has left a\nmiddle ground between the purely theoretical and the practical.\nCertainly architecture is not practical since it does not directly\nproduce anything, in the way carpentry does. However, it does give\ncommands, whose effects are practical; thus, it is not for knowledge\nonly, in the way in which calculation is for knowledge only. Insofar\nas architecture is an analogue for the political craft, the Visitor\nseems to be exploiting this middle ground (259e). It is as though the\nVisitor is trying to associate the political craft with the most\nabstract disciplines, like geometry, even though it has to have\npractical impact. In fact, including commanding knowledge under\ntheoretical knowledge reflects again the tension between the knowledge\nneeded to rule and the elaboration of that knowledge. The ruler needs\nto be able to engage in purely theoretical investigation; he also\nneeds to bring order into the city. The Visitor turns to the latter\nactivity when he compares the kingly or political knowledge to\nweaving. Finally, he arrives at the conclusion that the kingly\nknowledge weaves together all the other epist\u00eamai\n\u2014 like generalship and judging \u2014 as well as the laws and\nthose things having to do with the city (305e). While no resolution is\noffered to this tension, two features of this long discussion are\nsuggestive. If the kingly or political epist\u00eam\u00ea\nis like weaving, it depends on the ability first of all to distinguish\nwhat it will weave together. Insofar as dialectic is the skill of\ndistinguishing the things known, it can serve as preliminary to\nweaving because it is preliminary to showing how the kinds harmonize.\nFurther, if political knowledge is like architecture, it is a\ncommanding knowledge (epitaktik\u00ea epist\u00eam\u00ea);\nit gives commands. If we search for the source of these commands, a\nlikely source is the relations and distinctions to be found among\nforms. If so, the abstract structures discovered by\ngn\u00f4stik\u00ea are normative for the city, the way the\nforms are in the Republic.\n3. Aristotle\n\nThe obvious place to begin a consideration of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea in\nAristotle\u2019s writings is in Book VI of the Nicomachean\nEthics. Here Aristotle makes a very clear distinction between the\ntwo intellectual virtues, a distinction which is not always observed\nelsewhere in his work. He begins with the rational soul (to te\nlogon echon) which is divided into the calculating part (to\nlogistikon) and the scientific part (to\nepist\u00eamonikon). With the calculating part we consider\n(the\u00f4roumen) things which could be otherwise whereas with\nthe scientific part we consider things which could not be otherwise.\nWhen he adds that calculation and deliberation are the same, he\nindicates why calculation is about what could be otherwise; no one deliberates\nabout what cannot be otherwise (1139a5\u201315). Things which could be otherwise are, e.g., the contingencies of everyday life; things which\ncould not be otherwise are, e.g., the necessary truths of mathematics.\nWith this distinction between a reality which is contingent and a\nreality which is necessary, Aristotle has laid the foundation for the\nstrong distinction between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea.\n\nThen the account turns to action (praxis), where we find the\nkind of thought that deals with what is capable of change. The\nefficient cause of actions is choice (prohairesis). The cause\nof choice is desire (orexis) and reasoning toward an end\n(logos ho heneka tinos). Thought (dianoia) by itself\nmoves nothing, only thought that is practical\n(praktik\u00ea) and for the sake of an end. So, practical\nthought (dianoia praktik\u00ea) belongs to the calculative\npart and pertains to practical truth; theoretical thought\n(the\u00f4r\u00eatik\u00ea dianoia) belongs to the\nscientific part and pertains to truth and falsity. In turn, practical\nthought governs productive (poi\u00eatik\u00ea) action. The\nlatter has an end separate from the action, i.e., the product; we will\nsee that this kind of practical thought is  techn\u00ea.\nUnderlining the way action requires the two elements of the soul,\nAristotle sums up by saying choice can be called intellect fused with\ndesire (orektikos nous) or desire fused with thought\n(orexis diano\u00eatik\u00ea) (1139a17\u20131139b5). While\nthis chapter suggests that the truth sought by practical thought is\ndifferent in kind from the truth sought by theoretical\nthought\u2014because their respective objects are different\u2014it\nends with the summary claim that attaining truth is the function of\nboth parts of the rational soul; then he turns to the virtues which\nmake the soul able to attain the truth.\n\nThere are five virtues of thought: techn\u00ea,\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, phron\u00easis,\nsophia, and nous (1139b15). Various translations\nhave been offered for each of these terms. Most often,\ntechn\u00ea is translated as craft or art. While\nepist\u00eam\u00ea is generally rendered as knowledge, in\nthis context, where it is used in its precise sense, it is sometimes\ntranslated as scientific knowledge. However, one must not confuse this\nusage with our contemporary understanding of science, which includes\nexperimentation. Conducting experiments to confirm hypotheses is a\nmuch later development. Rather, translating\nepist\u00eam\u00ea as scientific knowledge is a way of\nemphasizing its certainty. In any event, as soon as Aristotle\nintroduces these five terms, he turns to the distinction between the\nfirst two virtues. First he defines epist\u00eam\u00ea, as\nhe says, in its accurate sense and leaving aside its analogous uses.\nScientific knowledge is distinguished by its objects, which do not\nadmit of being otherwise; these objects are eternal and exist of necessity.\nMore precisely, scientific knowledge comprises demonstration, starting\nfrom first principles; the latter must also be known, although they\nare not known by demonstration (1139b15\u201330). The full account of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense is found in\nPosterior Analytics, where Aristotle says that we think we\nknow something without qualification\n(epistasthai\u2026hapl\u00f4s) when we think we know\n(gign\u00f4skein) the cause by which the thing is, that it\nis the cause of the thing, and that this cannot be otherwise\n(71b10\u201315). As though to emphasize the necessity of what is\nknown, he most frequently uses geometry as an example of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. In this regard, it should be pointed\nout that Aristotle uses the notion of cause (aitia) in a\nbroader sense than it usually has in contemporary thought. Thus,\nunderstanding how the geometrical axioms lead to a theorem that right\ntriangles have a certain property would be an instance, for Aristotle,\nof understanding the cause of the proven property of the right\ntriangle.\n\nThe two virtues of thought that deal with what can be otherwise, i.e.,\nwhat is contingent, are techn\u00ea and\nphron\u00easis, craft and practical wisdom. Aristotle\nemphasizes the former, a disposition (hexis) with respect to\nmaking (poi\u00easis), is distinct from the latter, a\ndisposition with respect to doing (praxis). First,\ntechn\u00ea is a disposition that produces something by way\nof true reasoning; it is concerned with the bringing into existence\n(peri genesin) of things that could either exist or not. The\nprinciple (arch\u00ea) of these things is in the one who\nmakes them, whereas the principle of those things that exist by\nnecessity or by nature is in the things themselves (1140a1\u201320).\nFor instance, carpentry makes this house and medicine produces health\nin a particular case. What is contingent is whether this house exists\nor whether health exits in this case. Since what it produces could\nexist or not, its products are one of the ways craft deals with the\ncontingent. \n\nBy contrast, practical wisdom does not make something separate the way\ncraft does. Its province is doing (praxis) and not making\n(poi\u00easis). Presumably Aristotle is relying on a\ndistinction between activity, whose end is in itself, and making,\nwhose end is a product separate from the activity of making. When\nsomeone plays the flute, e.g., typically there is no further product\nof playing; playing the flute is an end in itself. However, when one\nmakes a house, e.g., the activity of making a house is not an end in\nitself but has a product, which is separate from the activity. This\ndistinction is clearer in the opening paragraphs of the\nNicomachean Ethics. There Aristotle says that each\ntechn\u00ea, investigation, action (praxis), and\nundertaking seems to aim at some good. The ends vary, however; some\nends are the activities themselves and some ends are products\n(erga) beyond the activities. As examples of these latter\nkinds of ends, he cites health as the end of medicine, a ship as the\nend of shipbuilding, and victory as the end of generalship; these ends\nare products separate from the respective activities\n(1094a5\u201310). \n\nThe distinction between making and doing is also important for another\ndistinction, in Book Two, between craft (techn\u00ea) and\nvirtue (aret\u00ea) because virtue is a kind of doing. The\nvalue of the works (ginomena) of technai is in the\nworks themselves--because they are of a certain sort. Whereas the\nvalue of a virtuous action depends on the agent, who must act with\nknowledge (eid\u00f4s) and deliberately choose the action\nfor itself; finally, the action must come from a fixed disposition of\ncharacter. The latter two features do not belong to\ntechn\u00ea (1105a25\u20131105b5). Presumably, then, the\ncraftsman does not choose his activity for itself but for the end;\nthus the value of the activity is in what is made. In the case of\nvirtue, by contrast, the value is not in a separate product but in the\nactivity itself. In the light of what Aristotle says about the\nactivity of virtue, we can better understand practical wisdom. For it,\ndoing well (eupraxia) is an end in itself. However, this end\nis quite expansive; it is doing well as a human being, living life\nwell in general. \n\nAristotle ends this chapter by saying that practical wisdom belongs to\nthe second part of the rational soul, i.e., the part whose object is\nwhat is contingent. Its virtue is the ability to form opinion\n(doxa) with respect to what is contingent\n(1140a1\u20131140b30). Of course, craft also belongs to this part of\nthe rational soul. So, it appears that both of these intellectual\nvirtues, which deal with contingent reality, form (scil.\ntrue) opinions. In the case of techn\u00ea, the opinions are\nthe basis for production; and in the case of phron\u00easis,\nthe opinions are the basis for living well. By making explicit the\nrole of opinion in dealing with contingent reality, Aristotle has\nmarked the fundamental difference between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, as scientific knowledge, and\ntechn\u00ea.\n\nWith this distinction we seem to have, at last, the classic division\nbetween the purely theoretical and the purely practical. Scientific\nknowledge concerns itself with the world of necessary truths, which\nstands apart from the world of everyday contingencies, the province of\ncraft. Still, there are many problems of interpretation surrounding\nthis description of scientific knowledge in Posterior\nAnalytics. While we cannot address them in this article, we can\nat least point out a central one. The description just given of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea makes scientific knowledge into a\ndeductive system in which the relations among terms are invariable and\nnecessary. The problem for commentators has been how to reconcile this\ndescription of epist\u00eam\u00ea with Aristotle\u2019s\nactual procedure in such treatises as the Physics and De\nAnima, where one does not find a deductive system of invariable\nand necessary relations. One possible explanation is that these\ntreatises are preliminary sketches for a truly scientific treatise. So\none could envision another Physics which would be a series of\ndeductions, all expressing invariable and necessary truths about\nnature. However, this charitable assessment does not avoid all\nproblems. In Metaphysics II, Aristotle explicitly undermines\nthe possibility of an epist\u00eam\u00ea, in the strict\nsense, with respect to nature. At the end of Book II, Aristotle makes\na distinction between the accuracy to be found in mathematics and that\nin other disciplines. Mathematical accuracy, he says, cannot be\nexpected in all things but only in those which do not contain matter.\nIn particular, then, one cannot expect mathematical accuracy in the\nstudy of nature since it is concerned with matter (995a15\u201320).\nIf \u2018mathematical accuracy\u2019 means the grasp of necessary\nand invariable relations among terms, then the study of nature will,\nby definition, have no such accuracy because what it studies contains\nmatter. About nature, then, we might have to settle for something less\nthan epist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense. Indeed, in\nBook VI of the Metaphysics, Aristotle seems to make a major\nconcession on the issue of epist\u00eam\u00ea when he says\nthat there is no knowledge of the accidental, i.e., what happens\ninfrequently, because all epist\u00eam\u00ea is of that\nwhich is always or for the most part (h\u00f4s epi to polu)\n(1027a20). Instead of grasping what is always and necessary, knowledge\ncan then grasp what happens for the most part, e.g., the regularities\nof nature, to which there are exceptions.\n\nThere is, then, some ambivalence in Aristotle\u2019s use of the term\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. For our purposes in this article, we\nwill leave suspended the question whether\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense is achievable in the\nstudy of nature. Still, we can recognize a secondary sense of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, since Aristotle in some contexts uses\nepist\u00eam\u00ea although the strict conditions do not\nhold. One of these contexts appears to be the study of nature. Whether\nin the study of nature epist\u00eam\u00ea in this secondary\nsense is the best that can be done or whether it can be converted into\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense, there is still a\nsecondary sense of epist\u00eam\u00ea, one that is not\ndefined in terms of what is eternal and necessary. As we shall see,\nthis secondary sense is important for understanding the relation\nbetween techn\u00ea and epist\u00eam\u00ea.\n\nNow that we have traced Aristotle\u2019s way of distinguishing craft\nfrom scientific knowledge and from virtue, we can focus on craft as\nproductive. As we have just seen, craft produces something by way of\ntrue reasoning. Aristotle also gives us a very interesting sketch of\nthis practical reasoning at work. In an important example from\nMetaphysics VII we see how the account of the goal is the\nbasis for reasoning which ends in action. In production the form is in\nthe soul of the one who produces; in the case of medicine, health is\nsuch a form. To begin with, health is knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and an account (logos) in the\nsoul. Then the physician engages in the following kind of reasoning:\nsince health is this particular state, if the patient is to be\nhealthy, he should have this other particular state, for instance\nhomogeneity, and if he is to have homogeneity, he should have heat.\nThe physician continues to reason in this way until he arrives at the\nlast step, the thing he can do. From this point the process, which\naims at health, is called production (1032b1\u201310).\n\nWith this sketch of practical reasoning we can come to closer grips\nwith what sorts of things could not be otherwise. Let us begin with health\nand the claim that the physician has an account of health. It is\nhealth that is the cause of the steps in the practical reasoning\nbecause it explains what is to be done. In what way does health admit\nof being otherwise? One possibility is that what constitutes health is not\ninvariable; thus the account of health would not be invariable. While\nit seems unlikely that health is variable in this sense, what\nobviously could be otherwise is whether health exists in this particular\ncase or not. If health does not exist in this case, it is up to\nmedicine to restore it. In this sense, as well, all of the steps\nprescribed by the practical reasoning could be otherwise. In the case of\nthis patient, homogeneity may or may not exist; heat may or may not\nexist. However, there is another sense in which the steps in the\nsyllogism might admit of being otherwise. Each step alleges a productive\nrelation \u2014 e.g., heat produces homogeneity. Now, there is a\nsense in which these relations could be otherwise. While heat produces\nhomogeneity, in a particular case heat causing homogeneity may or may\nnot exist because there may or may not be heat. To say of all these\nconditions that they could be otherwise, then, implies that they could or\ncould not exist. Whether these conditions exist or not depends on an\nagent bringing them into existence. So the field of craft is those\nconditions that can be brought into existence by an agent.\n\nTo this kind of contingency, however, another must be added. The\nproductive relation can be contingent in another sense. It is\ncontingent whether heat, e.g., produces homogeneity. Heat does not\ninvariably nor necessarily produce homogeneity, although it does do so\nfor the most part (Prior Analytics, 32b5\u201320). There\nare, then, two kinds of contingency possible in practicing medicine.\nThe first kind has to do with whether the physician acts or not; the\nsecond kind has to do with whether the productive relation holds or\nnot. On the one hand, if the first kind of contingency held but the\nsecond did not, the physician would have a nearly sovereign command of\nhealth. If the productive relations between heat and homogeneity and\nbetween homogeneity and health were invariable and necessary, then so\nlong as the physician could produce heat, he could invariably produce\nhealth. On the other hand, if the productive connections were not\ninvariable and necessary \u2014 but only held for the most part\n\u2014 then the physician could reliably but not invariably produce\nhealth (Metaphysics, 1026b30\u20131027a25). One could say of\ncontingent productive connections that they hold unless something\nunusual happens, that, e.g., heat always causes homogeneity unless\nsomething unusual intervenes. Accidental factors \u2014 by definition\nfactors which arise infrequently \u2014 can defeat the causal link\nbetween heat and homogeneity. But since accidental factors are\ninfrequent, one can claim that for the most part heat causes\nhomogeneity. In view of this kind of contingency, what the physician\ncan claim to know is that heat produces homogeneity unless something\nunusual intervenes. In his deliberations, what he does not know is\nwhen something unusual will happen (Nicomachean Ethics,\n1112a20\u20131112b10).\n\nScientific knowledge, in the strict sense, does not deal with these\nkinds of contingency. Nevertheless, Aristotle still describes medicine\n\u2014 which does deal with contingency \u2014 as an\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, as we have seen. Indeed, from time to\ntime, Aristotle mentions epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea in the same breath, as though they are not as\ndistinct as Nicomachean Ethics VI would make them seem. In\nthe Physics (194a20), Aristotle argues that the student of\nnature will study both form and matter. To illustrate he says that it\nbelongs to the same epist\u00eam\u00ea to study the form as\nwell as the matter; the physician, for instance, studies health as\nwell as bile and phlegm. In Nicomachean Ethics, in his\npolemic against the Platonic notion of the good itself\u2014 using\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea indifferently\n\u2014 Aristotle says the physician does not study health as such but\nhuman health \u2014 even the health of this human because it is\nindividuals that he cures (1097a10\u201315). Clearly, if medicine is\nan epist\u00eam\u00ea which studies health, it is also a\ntechn\u00ea which produces health. If he were using\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in its strict sense, he ought not to\nhave called medicine epist\u00eam\u00ea. Indeed, the mixing\nof epist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea is not\nconfined to medicine. In Nicomachean Ethics II, when he\nillustrates the notion of the mean between extremes, he cites experts\nin physical training. Generalizing, he says that every\nepist\u00eam\u00ea achieves well its goal (ergon)\nby looking at the mean and using that as a standard in its products.\nThen when he says next that the good craftsmen technitai\n(craftsmen) and techn\u00ea look to the mean, he shows there\nis no hard distinction between epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea in this context (1106b5\u201315).\n\nThus, a mixed picture of epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea begins to emerge. While techn\u00ea\ndeals with things which could be otherwise, Aristotle still has a tendency to call\nit epist\u00eam\u00ea. The reason for this tendency is\nprobably that, while the person with techn\u00ea does not\nhave epist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense, he has\nsomething close to it. At the beginning of the Metaphysics,\nAristotle says that the person with epist\u00eam\u00ea and\nthe person with techn\u00ea share an important similarity.\nThere Aristotle contrasts the person of experience (empeiria)\nwith someone who has techn\u00ea or\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. The former knows that, when Callias had\nsuch and such disease, thus and such helped him, and the same for\nSocrates and many others. However, the person who has a\ntechn\u00ea goes beyond experience to a universal judgment.\nThis judgment is that this remedy helped all individuals of this type,\nwith this disease. Examples of the types of individuals are the\nphlegmatic and the bilious, when afflicted with a burning fever\n(981a5\u201315). However, it is important to note that the universals\ncited \u2014 phlegmatic and bilious \u2014 have a role to play in\nexplaining a fever and, thus, a role to play in the account of a cure.\nAs Aristotle says, the master craftsman (technit\u00eas) is\nwiser than the person of experience because he knows the cause, the\nreasons that things are to be done. The mere artisan\n(cheirotechn\u00eas) acts without this knowledge\n(981a30\u2013b5). Aristotle goes on to say that in general the sign of\nknowing or not knowing (tou eidotos kai m\u00ea eidotos) is\nbeing able to teach. Because techn\u00ea can be taught, we\nthink it, rather than experience, is epist\u00eam\u00ea (\n981b10). Presumably the reason that the one with techn\u00ea\ncan teach is that he knows the cause and reason for what is done in\nhis techn\u00ea. So we can conclude that the person with\ntechn\u00ea is like the person with\nepist\u00eam\u00ea; both can make a universal judgment and\nboth know the cause. Of course, the epist\u00eam\u00ea in\nquestion is not meant in the strict sense; techn\u00ea is\nlike epist\u00eam\u00ea only in the secondary sense.\n\nStill, even if the craftsman is capable of a universal judgment about\nthe cause of disease, we ought not to conclude that there is no\ndifference between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, even in the secondary sense. We can\ntake our cue from the kind of accuracy Aristotle says is to be\nexpected in the study of the supreme good. In Nicomachean\nEthics I 3, he says that it is political science\n(politik\u00ea epist\u00eam\u00ea) which pursues\nthis study (1094b1). Since there is disagreement and error surrounding\nthe topic of the good, we must be content, concerning such a subject\nand relying on similar premises, to show the truth roughly and in\noutline. Given a subject and premises that hold for the most part\n(h\u00f4s epi to polu) similar conclusions will follow. He\nadds that it is the mark of an educated person to seek the amount of\naccuracy (takribes) that the nature of the subject matter\npermits (1094b20\u201325). Later in Book I, Aristotle returns to the\nproblem of the accuracy appropriate to different undertakings; one\nmust seek accuracy (akribeian) according to each subject\nmatter and to the degree that is appropriate to the method for\ninvestigating it. He illustrates this problem by comparing geometry\nwith carpentry. Both seek (epiz\u00eatousi) the right angle,\nthe latter insofar as it is useful for his product and the former as\nto what it is and its properties, since he is looking for the truth\n(1098a25\u201330). Here Aristotle suggests the notion of practical\naccuracy, clearly distinct from mathematical accuracy, is possibly\ndistinct from the accuracy of the study of nature. After all, the\naccuracy needed for production might also fall short of the standard\nrequired by the study of nature, even when this study is\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the secondary sense. Finally, nothing\nin the last distinction undermines the claim that\ntechn\u00ea is clearly distinct from\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense. The former is\nconfined to the world of contingencies; the domain of the latter is\nwhat is necessary.\n4. The Stoics\n\nAmong the Stoics, the relation between epist\u00eam\u00ea\nand techn\u00ea is the richest and most focused of all the\naccounts we have so far considered. That relation is enmeshed in the\nStoic account of virtue, in which the two notions of knowledge and\ncraft flow together in forming the science and art of living. Zeno\nrefers to a techn\u00ea which cures the diseases of the soul\n(SVF, i.e. Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, I 323) and\nChrysippus says that practical judgment (phron\u00easis) is\na kind of techn\u00ea concerning the things having to do\nwith life (SVF II 909). While virtue is compared to a\ntechn\u00ea, it is also a complete and unshakeable\nunderstanding of the universe. It has then some of the features of an\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in Aristotle\u2019s strong sense.\nClearly, such a position rests on the basis of peculiar Stoic\ndoctrines. We can begin with the Stoic idea of impulse to action.\nDiogenes Laertius says that, according to the Stoics, an animal has\nself-preservation as the object of its first impulse\n(horm\u00ea). So, the first thing appropriate\n(oikeios) to every animal \u2013 including humans \u2013 is\nits own constitution and the consciousness of this. Impulse leads\nevery animal to seek what is appropriate to it and rejects what is not\nappropriate. In addition, the constitution of adult humans includes\nreason; so, reason supervenes on what would be purely automatic\nimpulses in other animals. Stoics say that reason is itself the\ncraftsman (technit\u00eas) of the adult\u2019s impulses\n(Diogenes Laertius 7.85\u20136).\n\nFor the Stoics, however, reason\u2019s being the craftsman of all\nadult human impulses does not imply a division between the rational\nand any non-rational parts of the soul. Orthodox Stoics do not divide\nthe soul into reason and non-rational desires. Without this division\nthere is no basis for a distinction between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea as an intellectual virtue and reason as\nexercising a kind of techn\u00ea with respect to some\nnon-rational element. Rather, there is only the reasoning\n(dianoia) and governing principle\n(h\u00eagemonikon) which is capable of opposite states and\nthus becomes either virtue or vice (Plutarch, On moral virtue\n441 C\u2013D). Moral weakness or hesitancy comes from alternating judgments\nabout what is morally right (446E\u2013447A). Such an account implies that\nreason controls impulse solely by its judgments. One\u2019s emotions,\nthen, are not independent of reason; they cannot pursue as good\nsomething different from what reason takes to be good. In those who do\nnot know what the good is, reason gives rise to mistaken impulses to\naction. For instance, the belief that health is good is mistaken\nbecause only virtue is good; still, this mistaken belief is expressed\nas fear at the prospect of losing one\u2019s health, which, in turn,\ncan move one to preserve health at the expense of virtue. However, in\nthe one who knows that virtue is the only good \u2013 the sage\n\u2013 reason, unimpeded by fear, gives rise to impulses that aim\nonly at virtue. If reason is the craftsman of impulse and if\ntechn\u00ea implies knowledge, then it molds one\u2019s\nimpulsive feelings, i.e., the ones that lead one to act, through\nknowledge of the good. \n\nHowever, this knowledge of the good locates what is good for the sage\nin what is good for the whole universe. Zeno says that the end of life\nis to live in accordance with nature. In fact, living in accordance\nwith nature is the same as virtue (Diogenes Laertius, 7.87).\nChrysippus modifies Zeno\u2019s claim when he says that living in\naccordance with virtue is equivalent to living in accordance with the\nexperience of what happens by nature. What happens by nature is\ngoverned by universal law, which is right reason pervading everything\nand is identical with Zeus, who is the leader of the governance of\neverything (Diogenes Laertius, 7.87\u20138). The consequence is that\nthe sage\u2019s reason, endowed with knowledge of the way right\nreason pervades the universe, supervenes on impulse with the good of\nthe whole in view. Chrysippus says that there is no other or more\nappropriate way of approaching the account of things which are good\nand bad or the virtues or happiness than from universal nature and\nfrom the governance of the universe. (Plutarch. On Stoic\nSelf-contradictions 1035 C\u2013D)\n\nAt this point, we can appreciate the way Stoicism presents a distinct\nview of the relation between epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea. Socratic intellectualism holds that what one\nknows to be good is sufficient for one to do what is good; but it has\nno moral psychology to justify the claim. Finding the claim itself\nparadoxical, Plato explains the hesitancy to do what one knows to be\ngood by introducing non-rational elements into the soul. (See the\nentry on\n ancient ethical theory,\n especially the sections on Socrates and on Plato.) Finally, the\nStoics return to a form of Socratic intellectualism. However, Stoicism\nprovides the missing moral psychology with its doctrine of the unity\nof the soul. In the soul of the Stoic sage, the knowledge of the good\nis an unshakeable grasp of what is good both for the sage and for the\nwhole universe. Because of its unity, there is nothing in the soul of\nthe sage to oppose this knowledge. It is as though the Stoics assume\nthat, without opposition, this sort of knowledge would naturally pass\nover into action once the connection is made with a particular\nsituation. Any reason to think otherwise is false. One type of false\nopinion is theoretical (and external to moral reasoning) and comes\nfrom mistaken views about moral psychology that clutter the soul up\nwith non-rational parts. The other type is practical (and internal to\nmoral reasoning) and comes from failure to know that virtue is living\nin accordance with nature and is the only good. This type of false\nopinion gives rise to such emotions as fear, which impede living in\naccordance with nature. Once these are swept away, knowledge of what\nis good is motivation enough to act. In the sage, then, where the\nunity of the soul is perfected, the theoretical grasp characteristic\nof epist\u00eam\u00ea just is a techn\u00ea.\n\nThe way this techn\u00ea works is illustrated in another\nwidely held Stoic teaching, i.e., the unity of the virtues. Zeno held\nthat virtue is practical knowledge (phron\u00easis) in\nvarious forms. When phron\u00easis deals with what is owed\nto others it is justice (dikaiosun\u00ea); when it deals\nwith what should be chosen it is moderation\n(s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea); when it deals with what must be\nendured it is courage (andreia). In all of these definitions\nZeno means phron\u00easis to be knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) (Plutarch, On moral virtue\n441A). According to Sextus, the Stoics say that\nphron\u00easis, being knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) of the good and the evil, provides a\ntechn\u00ea concerning life (SVF III 598). Here we can see\nthe \u2018sage\u2019 or fully perfected human being has a kind of\ninsight into what is good and bad in each situation of life. In its\nparticularity, this insight is like that of a master craftsman, who\nknows what is appropriate at each juncture of his practice. And like\nthe master craftsman, the sage reacts appropriately both in the way he\nfeels and in the way he acts.\n\nStill, there is room for a distinction between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea. Several\nauthors attribute to Zeno the notion that a techn\u00ea is a\nsystematic collection of cognitions (katal\u00eapseis)\nunified by practice for some goal advantageous in life (SVF I 73). The\ndifference between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea properly speaking is that the latter is\nsaid to be secure and unshakeable by reason (Stobaeus\n2.73,16\u201374,3). In general, however, techn\u00ea does\nnot have the same kind of stability (Cicero, On Ends III.50).\nIndeed, such technai as love of music, and liberal arts in\ngeneral, are not even called knowledge (Stobaeus, 2.67, 5\u201312; cf\nSeneca, Letters 88). Nevertheless, such distinctions between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea do not keep\nthe Stoics from characterizing virtue as techn\u00ea. This\nspecial techn\u00ea does consist in a secure and unshakeable\ninsight into what is appropriate at each juncture of life.\n\nA significant refinement of this techn\u00ea is found in\nCicero\u2019s On Ends. In Book V, Piso, representing the\nviews of Antiochus of Ascalon, gives an overview of philosophical\nschools. The account depends on the notion of the highest good\n(summum bonum) because differences about the highest good\ndefine the possible schools. The explication of these differences\nbegins with an analogy drawn from the crafts (artes,\nCicero\u2019s Latin for the Greek technai). First of all,\nthe art is different from its object. Second, as medicine is the art\nof health and navigation the art of guiding ships, so prudence\n(practical wisdom) is the art of how to live (vivendi ars est\nprudentia). Piso presents this last claim as common to all the\nschools, or at least as a good way to present an element which is\ncommon. Next he says that whatever prudence would aim for is something\nsuited to our nature and the object of natural impulse (what the\nGreeks call horm\u00ea). Stoics hold that prudence aims for\nthe primary objects of nature. The primary objects of nature include\nsuch things as life and health. However, Stoics do not hold that\nactually obtaining the primary objects of nature is the highest good.\nRather they maintain that making every effort to obtain them (i.e.,\nappropriate ones among them, given the circumstances), even if one is\nunsuccessful, is morality and is the only thing desirable for itself\nand the highest good (V.16\u201320).\n\nIf life and health are among the primary objects of nature, then the\nStoic teaching is that doing everything to obtain life and health is\nmorality. But this claim must be qualified; it is not moral to strive\nfor life and health in an unjust way. Another of the primary objects\nof nature is human solidarity. Thus, making every effort to obtain\nlife and health (and the other primary objects of nature) is the same\nas being virtuous, just as making every effort to cure a patient is\nthe same as following the craft of medicine. Whether the sage actually\nobtains life and health (or his other specific objectives in his\nactions) is beyond his control. Finally, however, virtuously striving\nfor these is more important than obtaining them \u2014 it is, in\nfact, the only true good.\n\nIn Book III, the Stoic Cato explains this complicated position. Human\nbeings begin life automatically and instinctively seeking the primary\nobjects of nature, but as their power of reason develops, they come to\nrealize, if they attain a correct understanding, that moral action is\nreally the end of life. So they shift the aim of their life, from the\nprimary objects of nature themselves to doing everything possible to\nattain them. Using an analogy to marksmanship, Cato says that someone\nwho makes it his purpose to hit the target would do everything he\ncould to hit the target. Thus, he says, his end would be to try\neverything he could. Cato\u2019s thought is that the sage will aim\nfor such things as health; however, the good \u2014 and therefore the\nend he seeks \u2014 is in the way he pursues health. Thus, actually\ngetting health is preferable to not getting it, but pursuing it in a\nmoral way is what is desirable in itself. So, he explains, wisdom\n(sapientia) is not like medicine or navigation but closer to\nacting and dancing, where the end is the exercise of the art and is in\nthe art itself and not external to it. Even this analogy to the art of\ndancing is not quite adequate. According to Cato, a virtuous action\nentails all the virtues; presumably he means, e.g., a just action is\nalso moderate and courageous. However, not every dance movement\nincludes all the possible dance steps (III. 22\u201325). In sum, the\nStoics give us the powerful idea that the excellent human life, and\nhappiness, is the same thing as performing in an artful way, striving\nfor a life of natural satisfactions, but actually finding ultimate\nvalue in the way one strives.\n5. Alexander of Aphrodisias\n\nIn commenting on the notion of contingency in Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior Analytics, Alexander introduces the idea of stochastic\ntechn\u00ea \u2014 an idea important for the Stoic\nexplanation of virtue that we have just seen. Aristotle himself\nrecognizes a kind of knowledge that deals with things that happen for\nthe most part; what happens for the most part is distinct from what\nmay or may not happen (Prior Analytics, 32b5\u201320). In\nhis commentary on the kind of syllogism relative to what happens for\nthe most part, Alexander calls the technai that use this kind\nof syllogism stochastic. The root sense of \u2018stochastic\u2019 is\nthe ability to aim or hit. Obviously there is an ambiguity in the\nnotion. A necessary condition of being able reliably to hit the target\nis being able to aim; but aiming and hitting are different. If one\naims well, she usually hits, but contingencies can intervene.\nStochastic technai are ones subject to this kind of\ncontingency. Alexander calls them stochastic, in the sense of\nconjectural (In An.Pr. 39, 15\u201340, 5). When the\nphysician, e.g., aims at health, his aiming is a kind of conjecture,\nalbeit a grounded one, that such and such treatment will produce\nhealth.\n\nAlexander develops the notion of stochastic techn\u00ea\nfurther in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Topics.\nAddressing the problem that dialectic does not always achieve its\ngoal, i.e., leading the interlocutor to a contradiction, he divides\ntechnai into ones which achieve their ends by definite steps\nand those which cannot (In Top. 32,10\u201334,1). Given\nmaterials, tools, and other conditions, carpentry, e.g., can produce\nhouses by following a series of steps each of which is effective in a\ndeterminate way. However, medicine does not always cure and certainly\ndoes not cure with the reliability that carpentry produces houses.\nEven though medicine tries everything in its power, chance can\nintervene so that it does not achieve its goal, the curing of the\npatient. When carpentry, by contrast, tries everything in its power,\nit achieves its goal. If there is failure, it is the result not of\nchance but of error in executing the techn\u00ea, as\nAlexander says in Quaestiones (Quaestio 2.16,\n10\u201325). To mark the difference between these two kinds of\ntechn\u00ea, Alexander says that the task (ergon)\nof medicine is to try everything possible to achieve its goal\n(telos); but achieving its goal is not (totally) within the\npower of medicine. He calls stochastic, then, the sorts of\ntechn\u00ea whose task is to try everything possible to\nachieve its goal, the realization of the goal being subject to\nchance.\n\nIn a different vein, Alexander makes an interesting addition to\nAristotle\u2019s distinction between epist\u00eam\u00ea\nand techn\u00ea. In his account of wisdom in Book One of the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle argues that knowledge is valued for\nits own sake. In one place, Aristotle says that what distinguishes\nexperience (empeiria) from techn\u00ea is that the\nlatter has a rational account, which explains what it does. Of course,\nthe one with experience may be more effective than the inexperienced\nperson who has only the rational account. Still, we think the\ncraftsman wiser than the empiric because of his knowledge of the\naccount (Metaphysics 981a 5\u201330). The suppressed\nconclusion is that wisdom is characterized by knowledge of causes\nquite apart from the utility of knowing the causes. Another argument\nshows that wisdom is not productive knowledge. Since wonder is the\nbeginning of philosophy, satisfying that wonder is an end in itself.\nIn fact, this kind of pursuit arose when the requirements of necessity\nand ease were satisfied (Metaphysics 982b 10\u201315). So\nwisdom is knowledge without practical utility, an end in itself.\n\nIn his commentary on the Metaphysics, Alexander interprets\nthese arguments as showing that pure knowledge is superior to action.\nBut there is a difference between the claim that there is a kind of\nknowledge which is an end in itself and the claim that pure knowledge\nis superior to action. The latter idea is a distinct development in\nthinking about the relation between knowledge and craft. This\ndevelopment rests on the notion that action implies need and it is\nbetter to be without need. So knowledge that fills no need is superior\nto action, which fills some need or other. We see this idea at work in\nthe auxiliary arguments which Alexander offers to back up or explicate\nclaims made in Aristotle\u2019s text. For instance, when Alexander\nfirst claims that Aristotle means to show that knowledge is more\nhonorable than action, he says that action aims at some end other than\nitself. As though remembering that virtuous action \u2014 unlike\nproductive action \u2014 has no end outside itself, he immediately\noffers an argument to the effect that even virtuous actions have\nreference to the passions. Divine beings, who are without passions,\nhave no need of virtue. Those who have passions need the virtues in\norder to control the passions (In Metaph. 2, 1\u201310).\nObviously, to have passions is to be in need. The contrast between the\ndivine and the human also figures in another auxiliary argument. In\npassing, Aristotle says that one might justifiably think that wisdom\nis beyond human ability because in many ways human nature is in\nslavery (Metaphysics 982b30). Alexander explicates the remark\nabout slavery by saying that humans are slaves in that they need such\nthings as health and prosperity. But what is divine is free of all\nneed (In Metaph. 17, 15\u201320).\n\nAlexander returns to this theme in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior Analytics. At the beginning of the commentary, he\nclaims that theorizing is the highest of human goods. In making out\nthis claim, Alexander points to the situation of the gods, who are\nwithout emotions and therefore do not need the moral virtues. Nor do\nthey need to deliberate. What is left is contemplating the truth. For\nthe gods, theorizing about truth is continuous and uninterrupted. Such\na state is impossible for humans in general; but some may approach it.\nBy leaving behind emotions and the human condition, one may engage in\nthe divine activity of pure theorizing. Insofar as one is engaged in\nthis activity, a human becomes like the gods. If becoming like god\n(homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4(i)) is the greatest good for\nhumans, then syllogistic, the method for theorizing, is most valuable\n(In An. Pr. 5,20 \u2013 6,10). Although expressed\nhypothetically, becoming like god is being put forth as the greatest\ngood for humans. Even if a human cannot always be in such a state,\nwhen he is in a state of continuous and uninterrupted theorizing about\nthe truth, he is just so far forth like god. In this discussion\nAlexander is building on themes found in Aristotle\u2019s\nNicomachean Ethics (X.7\u20138). There Aristotle argues that\nthe life of contemplation is happiness because it is the virtue of the\nhighest part of the soul, reason. Since this part is the most\ngod-like, contemplation is in some sense divine activity. Still, in\nthese passages, Aristotle continues to talk about integrating\ncontemplation of truth within the context of a human life. By\ncontrast, Alexander suggests that one might lead \u2014 or at least\nstrive for\u2014 a god-like life of pure contemplation. In such an\naccount, pure theory is expressly divorced from practice and promoted\nover it.\n6. Plotinus\n\nAs might be expected, Plotinus\u2019 philosophy does not have much\nuse for the concept of techn\u00ea. Its account of knowledge\nis fuller than that of craft and is close to Aristotle\u2019s idea of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strong sense. In the\nEnneads, epist\u00eam\u00ea is not directly\nassociated with techn\u00ea. In the first place,\nepist\u00eam\u00ea refers to the particular cognitive state\nof the first hypostasis from the One, Nous, in which there is an\nidentity between knowledge and what is known (VI. 6. 15). Our souls\ngain true knowledge by the presence of Nous, although Nous knows\nnon-discursively while our souls characteristically know in a\ndiscursive way (V. 9. 7; IV. 3.18). Discursive knowledge is the sort\nof knowing that moves from, e.g., premise to conclusion;\nnon-discursive thought, then, is a unitary grasp or understanding.\nDiscursive knowledge, through dialectic, is able to speak in a\nreasoned way about each thing, say what it is and in what way it\ndiffers from others, and what it has in common with those with which\nit exists, and so on. It does all these things with certain knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and not by opinion (I. 3. 4). Plotinus\nalso uses epist\u00eam\u00ea in another sense to refer to\nthe various branches of knowledge which are articulated in theorems\n(e.g., IV. 3. 2). Since the ideal state for a human is to enjoy the\nknowledge which is found in Nous and then, beyond that, the\ncontemplation of the One, Plotinus gives short shrift to the civic\nvirtues of courage, justice, and moderation. Once one attains the\nhigher levels, he gives up the civic virtues in their usual sense. At\nthis level, moderation, for instance, is not measure and limit but\nrather separation from one\u2019s lower nature (I. 2. 7. 25).\n\nTechn\u00ea, then, is even further down Plotinus\u2019 list\nof concerns. He gives as examples of technai grammar,\nrhetoric, lyre playing, music, housebuilding, medicine, and farming\n(II. 3. 2. 10\u201315; IV. 4. 31. 15\u201320). The most important\nuse of the nature of techn\u00ea is to illustrate points\nabout the coming to be of the universe. Plotinus holds that Nous gives\nrise to the rational principle (logos) which is responsible\nfor the existence of our universe (III. 2. 2) although the rational\nprinciple does not create the universe because the universe neither\ncomes into existence nor perishes (III. 2. 1). Still, Plotinus uses\nanalogies with techn\u00ea to explain the work of the\nrational principle. In the treatise on beauty, he says that beauty in\nthe material world comes from shape or form and rational principle;\ninsofar as matter is ordered by these it is beautiful. As an\nillustration of this point he cites the way techn\u00ea can\nbestow beauty on a house and its parts (I. 6. 2). In justifying the\npresence of both good and evil in the universe, he cites the way a\npainter includes varying and contrasting elements in painting (III. 2.\n11). In another very striking passage, Plotinus invokes the\ntechnai of dance, music, and drama to explain the way\ncontrasting elements in the life of the universe are blended (III. 2.\n16). Nevertheless, there are ways in which the activity of the\nrational principle is different from techn\u00ea. The most\nimportant is that rational principle does not reason that the universe\nshould exist; the creative power of rational principle is the power to\nmake another thing without striving for its being made. This power is\nnot acquired or learnt the way a techn\u00ea is (III. 2. 2).\nIn explaining the way nature works, Plotinus says that nature is\nproductive because of its contemplation of realities in Nous. Its act\nof contemplation makes what it contemplates\u2014 as though the very\nact of contemplation were automatically productive (III. 8. 4). In a\nsimilar vein he says that the universe is an image of reality but does\nnot exist by discursive thought (dianoia) nor by contrivance\nof craft (epitechn\u00easis) (II. 9. 8). Plotinus, then, is\nproposing the interesting notion that pure thought, while distinct\nfrom craft, can be productive in its own right.\n\nHence Plotinus can dismiss techn\u00ea as later than soul\nand imitating it, making unclear and weak copies, childish things not\nworth much, stacking up many devices in making an image of nature (IV.\n3. 10). Still, Plotinus makes some interesting claims about craft when\nhe is being less severe. Making an analogy with the beauty in Nous,\nPlotinus says that the statue is beautiful not because of the stone\nbut because of the form which craft puts in it. Moreover, this beauty\nwhich exists in the craft is much better than the beauty expressed in\nthe stone (V. 8. 1). Drawing another analogy between Nous and\ntechn\u00ea, he says that the forming principles of the\nuniverse come from Nous the way the forming principles in the souls of\ncraftsmen come from their crafts (V. 9. 3). Finally he raises the\nquestion whether techn\u00ea might be based somehow in the\nintelligible world. In answer, he distinguishes those crafts which\nimitate nature from those which consider proportion in general. The\nformer are painting, sculpture, dance, and mime. However, music deals\nwith proportion of an intelligible kind (V. 9. 11). Music, then, has\nsome grasp of purely intelligible proportion.\n",
