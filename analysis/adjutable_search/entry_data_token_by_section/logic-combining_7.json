Moreover, at the semantical level, algebraic fibring, by its\nown nature, does not make possible to keep representatives of all the\nmodels of the original logics (which leads to the collapsing\nproblem of fibring, see\n section 5).\n\nWith the aim of still enlarging the range of application of algebraic\nfibring, so as to make it able to deal with substructural logics and\nwith logics endowed with nondeterministic semantics, as well as to\ncombine pointwise models of each logic, a formalism for representing\nlogics and their combinations based on the general notion of\nmulti-graphs (or, for short, m-graphs) was proposed by A. Sernadas and\nhis collaborators (see Sernadas et al. 2009a, 2009b). Multi-graphs are\ngraphs where the source of each edge is a finite sequence of nodes\n(instead of a unique node). Concerning signatures, the nodes of the\nm-graph are seen as sorts and the m-edges are seen as language\nconstructors. From the semantical viewpoint, nodes are truth-values\nand m-edges are relations between truth-values. Finally, concerning\ndeductive systems, nodes are language expressions, and m-edges are\ninference rules. The fibring of logics described by m-graphs (a.k.a.\ngraph-theoretic fibring) is defined by pointwise combining\nmodels of each combined logic, in contrast to the usual notion of\nsemantic fibring in which entire classes of models are combined. This\nallows one to avoid the collapsing problem (see the next section) in a\nvery natural way.\n\nAs an immediate application of this graph-theoretic setting, the\npreservation of the finite-model property by graph-theoretic fibring\nwas proved in Coniglio et al. 2011. Since (under reasonable\nconditions) the finite model property entails decidability, this\nresult is particularly useful.\n\nAnother application to the graph-theoretic account of logic is the\ndefinition of an asymmetric combination technique called importing\nlogics (see Rasga et al. 2012). Temporalization, as well as its\ngeneralization, modalization (see Fajardo and Finger 2003 and\nFinger and Weiss 2002), are particular cases of importing logics.\nUnder this approach, the combined language is endowed with an explicit\nconstructor called importing connective which transforms\nformulas of the imported logic into formulas of the importing logic.\nThis is the main difference between the technique of importing logics\nand the related technique of parameterization (which also generalizes\ntemporalization, see\n subsection 4.5).\n Semantically, each model of the resulting logic obtained by the\nmethod of importing logics is a pair composed of a model of the\nimporting logic and a model of the imported logic, plus the\ninterpretation of the importing connective. In Rasga et al. 2014 a new\nformulation of algebraic fibring, called biporting, was\nintroduced, which turns out to be equivalent to the original one. From\nthis, it is possible to prove that some particular cases of importing,\nlike temporalization, modalization and globalization, are subsumed by\nfibring.\n\nA new mechanism for combining logics called meet combination of\nlogics was firstly presented in C. Sernadas et al. 2013 and\nadditionaly developed in Rasga et al. 2016. This technique is based on the idea of melding or pairing\nconnectives (of the same arity) of two given logics being\ncombined. The melded connectives of the resulting logic inherit the\ncommon properties enjoyed in both logics, instead of the union of\ntheir properties, as it occurs in the case of the shared connectives\nof constrained fibring. The idea of pairing connectives within a\nsingle logic was already explored in Sernadas et al. 2011a and 2011b,\ntowards identifying common properties of any given pair of connectives\nof the same arity.\n",
