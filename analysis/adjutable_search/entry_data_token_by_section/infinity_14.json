    "main_text": "Paradise lost? Paradoxes and puzzles involving infinity || Hilbert\u2019s Hotel\n5.1 Hilbert\u2019s Hotel\n\nHilbert\u2019s Hotel has infinitely many rooms, labelled 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, each of which is currently occupied by a guest. Despite the\nfact that the hotel is already full, a new guest who turns up at\nreception is readily accommodated: for each n, the guest in room \\(n\\)\nis moved to room \\(n+1\\), and the new guest is installed in room 1.\nIndeed, despite the fact that the hotel is already full, it can\naccommodate infinitely many new guests: for each \\(n\\), the guest in\nroom \\(n\\) is moved to room \\(2n\\), and the new guests are installed\nin the odd-numbered rooms. Of course, if the infinitely many people in\nthe odd-numbered rooms check out, there are infinitely many people\nleft in Hilbert\u2019s Hotel; but if infinitely many people check out\nfrom all but the first three rooms, only three people remain.\n\nSome philosophers have thought that Hilbert\u2019s Hotel supports an\nargument against the possibility of physically realized\ninfinities:\n\nIf there could be physically realized infinities, then there could\nbe a hotel with infinitely many rooms.\nBut if there could be a hotel with infinitely many rooms, then the\nevents described in the preceding paragraph could occur.\nBut it is absurd to suppose that the events described in the\npreceding paragraph could occur.\n\n\nSo there cannot be physically realized infinities. (See, e.g., Craig\n(1979).)\n\nThis argument faces various challenges, depending on one\u2019s views\nabout what physical possibility amounts to. The first premise may be\nchallenged: perhaps some kinds of physical infinities can be realized\neven though other kinds of physical infinities cannot: for example,\nperhaps there can be infinitely many stars even though there cannot be\na hotel with infinitely many rooms. The second premise may also be\nchallenged: even if there could be a hotel with infinitely many rooms,\nperhaps the events described in the story could not occur\u2014the\nstory was told at a high level of abstraction, and the details may\nmatter. And the third premise is also questionable: it is not clearly\nabsurd to suppose that there could be an infinite hotel in which\nguests come and go in the manner described.\n\nFor further discussion of Hilbert\u2019s Hotel, see Gamow (1946),\nHuby (1971), Rucker (1982), Moore (1990/2019), Oppy (2006), Kragh\n(2014), Huemer (2016), and the entries on\n supertasks\n and\n cosmology and theology.\n",
