    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Pythagoras || The Fate of the Soul\u2014Metempsychosis\n4.1 The Fate of the Soul\u2014Metempsychosis\n\n\nThe earliest evidence makes clear that above all Pythagoras was known\nas an expert on the fate of our soul after death. Herodotus tells the\nstory of the Thracian Zalmoxis, who taught his countrymen that they\nwould never die but instead go to a place where they would eternally\npossess all good things (IV. 95). Among the Greeks the tradition arose\nthat this Zalmoxis was the slave of Pythagoras. Herodotus himself\nthinks that Zalmoxis lived long before Pythagoras, but the Greeks\u2019\nwillingness to portray Zalmoxis as Pythagoras\u2019 slave shows that they\nthought of Pythagoras as the expert from whom Zalmoxis derived his\nteaching. Ion of Chios (5th c. BCE) says of Phercydes of\nSyros that \u201calthough dead he has a pleasant life for his soul,\nif Pythagoras is truly wise, who knew and learned wisdom beyond all\nmen.\u201d Here Pythagoras is again the expert on the life of the\nsoul after death. A famous fragment of Xenophanes, Pythagoras\u2019\ncontemporary, provides some more specific information on what happens\nto the soul after death. He reports that \u201conce when he\n[Pythagoras] was present at the beating of a puppy, he pitied it and\nsaid \u2018stop, don\u2019t keep hitting him, since it is the soul of a\nman who is dear to me, which I recognized, when I heard it\nyelping\u2019\u201d (Fr. 7).  Although Xenophanes clearly finds the\nidea ridiculous, the fragment shows that Pythagoras believed in\nmetempsychosis or reincarnation, according to which human souls were\nreborn into other animals after death. This early evidence is\nemphatically confirmed by Dicaearchus in the fourth century, who first\ncomments on the difficulty of determining what Pythagoras taught and\nthen asserts that his most recognized doctrines were \u201cthat the\nsoul is immortal and that it transmigrates into other kinds of\nanimals\u201d (Porphyry, VP 19). Unfortunately we can say\nlittle more about the details of Pythagoras\u2019 conception of\nmetempsychosis. According to Herodotus, the Egyptians believed that\nthe soul was reborn as every sort of animal before returning to human\nform after 3,000 years. Without naming names, he reports that some\nGreeks both earlier and later adopted this doctrine; this seems very\nlikely to be a reference to Pythagoras (earlier) and perhaps\nEmpedocles (later).  Many doubt that Herodotus is right to assign\nmetempsychosis to the Egyptians, since none of the other evidence we\nhave for Egyptian beliefs supports his claim, but it is nonetheless\nclear that we cannot assume that Pythagoras accepted the details of\nthe view Herodotus ascribes to them. Similarly both Empedocles (see\nInwood 2001, 55\u201368) and Plato (e.g., Republic X and\nPhaedrus) provide a more detailed account of transmigration\nof souls, but neither of them ascribes these details to Pythagoras nor\nshould we. Did he think that we ever escape the cycle of\nreincarnations? We simply do not know.  The fragment of Ion quoted\nabove may suggest that the soul could have a pleasant existence after\ndeath between reincarnations or even escape the cycle of reincarnation\naltogether, but the evidence is too weak to be confident in such a\nconclusion. In the fourth century several authors report that\nPythagoras remembered his previous human incarnations, but the\naccounts do not agree on the details. Dicaearchus (Aulus Gellius\nIV. 11.14) and Heraclides (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 4) agree that he\nwas the Trojan hero Euphorbus in a previous life. Dicaearchus\ncontinues the tradition of savage satire begun by Xenophanes, when he\nsuggests that Pythagoras was the beautiful prostitute, Alco, in\nanother incarnation (Huffman 2014b, 281\u2013285).\n\n\nIt is not clear how Pythagoras conceived of the nature of the\ntransmigrating soul but a few tentative conjectures can be made\n(Huffman 2009). Transmigration does not require that the soul be\nimmortal; it could go through several incarnations before perishing.\nDicaearchus explicitly says that Pythagoras regarded the soul as\nimmortal, however, and this agrees with Herodotus\u2019 description of\nZalmoxis\u2019 view.  It is likely that he used the Greek\nword psych\u00ea to refer to the transmigrating soul, since\nthis is the word used by all sources reporting his views, unlike\nEmpedocles, who used daimon. His successor, Philoalus,\nuses psych\u00ea to refer not to a comprehensive soul but\nrather to just one psychic faculty, the seat of emotions, which is\nlocated in the heart along with the faculty of sensation (Philolaus,\nFr. 13). This psych\u00ea is explicitly said by Philolaus to\nbe shared with animals. Herodotus uses psych\u00ea in a\nsimilar way to refer to the seat of emotions. Thus it seems likely\nthat Pythagoras too thought of the\ntransmigrating psych\u00ea in this way. If so, it is\nunlikely that Pythagoras thought that humans could be reincarnated as\nplants, since psych\u00ea is not assigned to plants by\nPhilolaus. It has often been assumed that the transmigrating soul is\nimmaterial, but Philolaus seems to have a materialistic conception of\nsoul and he may be following Pythagoras. Similarly, it is doubtful\nthat Pythagoras thought of the transmigrating soul as a comprehensive\nsoul that includes all psychic faculties. His ability to recognize\nsomething distinctive of his friend in the puppy (if this is not\npushing the evidence of a joke too far) and to remember his own\nprevious incarnations show that personal identity was preserved\nthrough incarnations. This personal identity could well be contained\nin the pattern of emotions, that constitute a person\u2019s character and\nthat is preserved in the psych\u00ea and need not presuppose\nall psychic faculties. In Philolaus this psych\u00ea\nexplicitly does not include the nous (intellect), which is\nnot shared with animals. Thus, it would appear that what is shared\nwith animals and which led Pythagoras to suppose that they had special\nkinship with human beings (Dicaearchus in Porphyry, VP 19) is\nnot intellect, as some have supposed (Sorabji 1993, 78 and 208) but\nrather the ability to feel emotions such as pleasure and pain. \n\n\nThere are significant points of contact between the Greek religious\nmovement known as Orphism and Pythagoreanism, but the evidence for\nOrphism is at least as problematic as that for Pythagoras and often\ncomplicates rather than clarifies our understanding of Pythagoras\n(Betegh 2014; Burkert 1972a, 125 ff.; Kahn 2002, 19\u201322; Riedweg\n2002). There is some evidence that the Orphics also believed in\nmetempsychosis and considerable debate has arisen as to whether they\nborrowed the doctrine from Pythagoras (Burkert 1972a, 133; Bremmer\n2002, 24) or he borrowed it from them (Zhmud 2012a,\n221\u2013238). Dicaearchus says that Pythagoras was the first to introduce\nmetempsychosis into Greece (Porphyry VP 19). Moreover, while\nOrphism presents a heavily moralized version of metempsychosis in\naccordance with which we are born again for punishment in this life so\nthat our body is the prison of the soul while it undergoes punishment,\nit is not clear that the same was true in Pythagoreanism. It may be\nthat rebirths in a series of animals and people were seen as a natural\ncycle of the soul (Zhmud 2012a, 232\u2013233). One would expect that the\nPythagorean way of life was connected to metempsychosis, which would\nin turn suggest that a certain reincarnation is a reward or punishment\nfor following or not following the principles set out in that way of\nlife. However, there is no unambiguous evidence connecting the\nPythagorean way of life with metempsychosis. \n\n\n  It is crucial to recognize that most Greeks followed Homer in\nbelieving that the soul was an insubstantial shade, which lived a\nshadowy existence in the underworld after death, an existence so bleak\nthat Achilles famously asserts that he would rather be the lowest\nmortal on earth than king of the dead (Homer, Odyssey\nXI. 489). Pythagoras\u2019 teachings that the soul was immortal, would have\nother physical incarnations and might have a good existence after\ndeath were striking innovations that must have had considerable appeal\nin comparison to the Homeric view.  According to Dicaearchus, in\naddition to the immortality of the soul and reincarnation, Pythagoras\nbelieved that \u201cafter certain periods of time the things that\nhave happened once happen again and nothing is absolutely new\u201d\n(Porphyry, VP 19).  This doctrine of \u201ceternal\nrecurrence\u201d is also attested by Aristotle\u2019s pupil Eudemus,\nalthough he ascribes it to the Pythagoreans rather than to Pythagoras\nhimself.  (Fr. 88 Wehrli). The doctrine of transmigration thus seems\nto have been extended to include the idea that we and indeed the whole\nworld will be reborn into lives that are exactly the same as those we\nare living and have already lived.\n",
