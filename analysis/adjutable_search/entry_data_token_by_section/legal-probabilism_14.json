    "main_text": "Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications || Modeling an entire case\n3.3 Modeling an entire case\n\nKadane and Schum (2011) made one of the first attempts to model an entire\ncriminal case, Sacco and Vanzetti from 1920, using probabilistic\ngraphs. More recently, Fenton and Neil (2013 [2018]) constructed a\nBayesian network for the Sally Clark case (discussed earlier in\n \u00a71.3),\n reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe arrows depict relationships of influence between variables.\nWhether Sally Clark\u2019s sons, call them \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), died by\nSIDS or murder (A.cause and B.cause)\ninfluences whether signs of disease\n(A.disease and B.disease)\nand bruising (A.bruising\nand B.bruising)\nwere present. Since son \\(A\\)\ndied first, whether \\(A\\) was murdered or died by SIDS (A.cause)\ninfluences how son \\(B\\) died\n(B.cause). How the sons died\ndetermines how many sons were murdered (No.murdered),\nand how many sons were\nmurdered decides whether Sally Clark is guilty (Guilty).\n\nAccording to the calculation by Fenton and Neil (2013 [2018]) (see\ntheir paper for details), the prior probability of Guilty\n= Yes should be .0789. After taking into\naccount the incriminating evidence presented at trial, such as that\nthere were signs of bruising but no signs of a preexisting disease\naffecting the children, the posterior probabilities are as\nfollows:\n\nTable 8\n\n\nEvidence (cumulative)\n\\(\\Pr(\\textrm{Clark guilty})\\)  \n\n\nA bruising\n.2887 \n\nA no signs of disease\n.3093 \n\nB bruising\n.6913 \n\nB no signs of disease\n.7019  \n\n\nThe incriminating evidence, combined, brings the probability of guilt\nfrom .0789 to .7019. This is a significant increase, but not quite\nenough for a conviction. If one wishes to perform sensitivity\nanalysis\u2014see earlier discussion in\n \u00a71.4\u2014by\n modifying some of the probabilities, this can be easily done. During\nthe appeal trial, new evidence was discovered, in particular, evidence\nthat son \\(A\\) was affected by a disease. Once this evidence is taken\ninto account, the probability of guilt drops to .00459 (and if signs\nof disease were also present on \\(B\\), the guilt probability would\ndrop even further to .0009). For a general discussion on how to elicit\nprobabilities, see Renooij (2001) and Gaag et al.\n(1999).\n",
