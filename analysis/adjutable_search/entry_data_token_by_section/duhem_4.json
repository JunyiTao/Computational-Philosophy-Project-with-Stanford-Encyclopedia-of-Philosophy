    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science || Later Developments\n2.3 Later Developments\n\n\nAs presented so far, Duhem is a philosopher who weaves together two\nlarge patchworks of theses: (i) instrumentalism or fictionalism,\nanti-atomism or anti-Cartesianism, anti-modelism, and autonomy of\nphysics from metaphysics and (ii) anti-inductivism or critique of\nNewtonian method, the Duhem thesis, that is, non-falsifiability and\nnon-separability. Both sets of theses are intended as empirical theses\nabout the workings of science and both are important to understanding\nDuhem\u2019s thought. The first set of theses effectively demarcates\nphysical theory as an autonomous domain apart from other domains, that\nis, rejects any external method, and the second set then operates on\nthe internal workings of physical theory. Having set apart physical\ntheory, Duhem asserts that no internal method leads inexorably to the\ntruth.\n\n\nFor Duhem, there are always at least two basic ways of proceeding in\nscience. Some scientists prefer the clutter of concrete details and\nthus do not mind ad hoc explanations, complications, and corrected\ntheories; others prefer abstract, simple, and uncomplicated theories,\neven if they are gotten at the price of conceptual novelty. As we have\nseen, Duhem discusses this dichotomy under the rubric of the English\nmind and the French mind\u2014what he also calls \u201cesprit de\nfinesse\u201d and \u201cesprit de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie,\u201d\nfollowing Blaise Pascal. Despite the labels \u201cEnglish\u201d and\n\u201cFrench,\u201d Duhem\u2019s categories are analytic ones, not\nmere epithets to be used rhetorically against his adversaries. In fact,\nfrom the start, when he described the broad-shallow English mind, his\narchetype was Napoleon Bonaparte, a great genius of military\ndetails\u2014not an Englishman. Duhem\u2019s ideal of the narrow-deep\nFrench mind was Newton, the geometer of physics\u2014not a Frenchman.\nThus, when Duhem accused Faraday and Maxwell of having English minds,\nhe did so by trying to establish something about how they conducted\ntheir science, not by referring to their ancestry.\n\n\nIn his last work, La science allemande, mostly a work of\nwartime propaganda, Duhem added a third kind of mind to his original\ntwo, namely, the German mind. If there are two basic types, the French\nmind and the English mind, then what could the German mind possibly be?\nCiting Pascal, Duhem tells us that truth requires both reason and\nargument\u2014raison and raisonnement. Logic, or our\nability to link propositions with one another, allows us to deduce one\ntruth from another; but that ability, by itself, merely gets us back to\nfirst principles or axioms. We also need a faculty that allows us to\nintuit the truth of the first principles or axioms, that is, bon\nsens (good sense). Bon sens is to \u201cesprit de\nfinesse\u201d what \u201cpure logic\u201d is to \u201cesprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie.\u201d Moreover, bon sens, our\nfaculty of recognizing fundamental truth gets perfected by the practice\nof history, by our becoming more aware of the failures and successes of\nprevious theories, by thinking about the trajectory of scientific\ntheories, rather than by considering a single theory frozen in time.\nThe dual scheme can now be expanded. We need logic, the ability to\nsystematize, but we also need intuition, the recognition of truth. When\none of these is allowed to dominate, we get a science which is all\nintuition, all \u201cesprit de finesse,\u201d but no logical\ncoherence, namely, English science; or we get a science which is all\nlogic, lacking bon sens, namely, German science. German science then is\na degenerate kind of French science, the latter being predominantly\n\u201cesprit de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie,\u201d corrected by bon\nsens.\n\n\nAs a result, we can talk about a continuum of sciences; at one extreme\non the theoretical side is German science, or logicism, and at the\nother extreme on the experimental side is English science, or crude\nmodelism. In the middle is French science, which allegedly tempers the\nlogical bent with historicism.\n\n\nIn a well-known chapter of Social Theory and Social Structure,\nthe sociologist of science Robert Merton refers to Duhem\u2019s\ncritique of German science as one of the many polemics against national\nkinds affirming a universalistic standard: \u201cDispassionate\nscientists impugned \u2018enemy\u2019 contributions, charging\nnationalistic bias, log-rolling, intellectual dishonesty, incompetence,\nand lack of creative capacity. Yet this very deviation from the norm of\nuniversalism actually presupposed the legitimacy of the norm. For\nnationalistic bias is opprobrious only if judged in terms of the\nstandard of universalism\u2026 Thus by the very process of condemning\ntheir violation, the mores are reaffirmed\u201d (1968, 8).\n\n\nAt first glance Duhem\u2019s polemics against German science might\nseem to arise from a universalistic standard. Duhem does talk at times\nof a perfect form of science, one without personal or national\ncharacter: \u201cQuite often the great masters possess a reason in\nwhich all the faculties are so harmoniously proportioned that their\nvery perfect doctrines are exempt from all individual character, as\nfrom all national character. \u2026 In such works one no longer sees\nthe genius of this or that people, but only the genius of\nHumanity\u201d (1915, 105 [EHPS, 253]). Such perfection for Duhem is an\nequilibrium of disparate elements, not itself a single ideal type.\nDuhem might regret what he sees as an overabundance of esprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie in German science, and might wish that it be\ntempered by a bit more finesse, but there is no suggestion in Duhem\nthat there is only one way to proceed in science.\n\n\nDuhem specifically states that the\n\n\nperfect form of science could not be obtained except by a very precise\nseparation of the various methods concurring in the discovery of truth.\nEach of the many faculties that human reason puts into play when it\nwishes to know more and better would have to play its role, without\nanything being omitted, without any faculty being overlooked. This\nperfect equilibrium between the many organs of reason does not occur in\nany one man. In each of us one faculty is stronger and another weaker.\nIn the conquest of truth the weaker will not contribute as much as it\nshould and the stronger will take on more than its share. (1915, 104\n[EHPS, 252]).\n\n\nAt bottom, despite his talk of ideal type and equilibrium,\nDuhem\u2019s science is not universalistic. The strength of his\nanalysis is that there is no single direction within science that each\nindividual must follow. For that, one would need to ground physics in a\nparticular metaphysics\u2014which Duhem explicitly rejects with his\ninstrumentalism\u2014or rather, to be guided by what one projects\nmetaphysics will look like over the long run. Unfortunately, Duhem took\nthis last thought too rigidly and ultimately condemned all innovations\nas breaking with the past, either due to an excess of esprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie, as with non-Euclidean geometry and\nrelativity, or an excess of esprit de finesse, as with\nelectron theory. But his philosophy of science itself contained the\nseeds of scientific pluralism, which are the foundations of the Duhem\nthesis, that is, the thought that there are many legitimate and\ndisparate ways of proceeding in science.\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s famous critique of crucial experiments follows a similar\npattern. Duhem argues that crucial experiments resemble false dilemmas:\nhypotheses in physics do not come in pairs, so that crucial experiments\ncannot transform one of the two into a demonstrated truth. For example,\nthe Newtonian emission theory predicts that light travels faster in\nwater than in air; according to the wave theory, light travels slower\nin water than in air. Dominique Fran\u00e7ois Arago proposed a\ncrucial experiment comparing the respective velocities. L\u00e9on\nFoucault then devised an apparatus to measure the speed of light in\nvarious media and found a lower velocity in water than in air. Arago\nand Foucault concluded for the wave theory, thinking that the\nexperiment refuted the emission theory. Discussing Foucault\u2019s\nexperiment, Duhem asks whether we dare assert that no other hypothesis\nis imaginable and suggests that instead of light being either a simple\nparticle or wave, it might be something else, perhaps a disturbance\npropagated within a dielectric medium, as theorized by Maxwell (1914,\n285\u201389; 1954, 188\u201390).\n\nMore than a century after Duhem argued for his non-falsifiability\nthesis, the set of issues connected with it are still elaborated upon,\ncriticized, and defended in the large literature on the philosophy of\nscience. Given holism, non-falsifiability follows logically and thus,\nwhen an experiment goes wrong, there is no set way to determine which\nhypothesis among many hypotheses is defective. Duhem proposed bon\nsens as a resolution to the problem, but that solution seemed\nunsatisfactory to many: it looked more psychological than\nepistemological and it sounded too vague. Thus scholars attempted to\narticulate further what Duhem might have meant as bon sens\n(see Ivanova 2010, Kidd 2011, Ivanova 2011, and Ivanova and Pasternote\n2013). Others proposed their own resolutions to the problem,\nattempting to isolate defective hypotheses by extra-logical means,\nwhether by inference to the best explanation, Bayesian devices,\nerror-statistical methods, or though elaborate experimental practices;\nfor an analysis of such solutions, see Dietrich and Honenberger 2020\nor Ivanova 2021).\n",
