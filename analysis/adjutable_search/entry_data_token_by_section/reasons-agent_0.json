    "main_text": "The Principle-Based Conception\n1. The Principle-Based Conception\n\nThe principle-based version of the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction actually predates the terminology\n\u2018agent-relative\u2019 and \u2018agent-neutral\u2019. Thomas\nNagel instead uses the terms \u2018subjective\u2019 and\n\u2018objective\u2019 to mark a version of the principle-based\ndistinction in his classic The Possibility of Altruism (Nagel\n1970). The terms \u2018agent-relative\u2019 and\n\u2018agent-neutral\u2019 were later introduced by Derek Parfit\n(Parfit 1984) and Nagel himself then adopted Parfit\u2019s\nterminology (Nagel 1986). As background to Nagel\u2019s version of\nthe distinction, we must first note that for Nagel, reasons are\nuniversal, in the sense that for every token reason there corresponds\na predicate R which figures in a universally quantified\nproposition of the following form:\n\nEvery reason is a predicate R such that for all persons\np and events A, if R is true of A,\nthen p has prima facie reason to promote A. (Nagel\n1970: 47)\n\n\nWith this conception of the universality of reasons in hand, Nagel\narticulates the distinction as follows:\n\nFormally, a subjective reason is one whose defining predicate\nR contains a free occurrence of the variable p. (The\nfree-agent variable will, of course, be free only within\nR; it will be bound by the universal quantification over\npersons which governs the entire formula.) All universal reasons and\nprinciples expressible in terms of the basic formula either contain a\nfree-agent variable or they do not. The former are subjective; the\nlater will be called objective. (Nagel 1970: 91)\n\n\nDrawn in such formal terms, the distinction can seem alien and\ndifficult to grasp but the basic idea is actually not that complex. A\nfew examples should help illustrate Nagel\u2019s idea. Suppose that\nthere is reason for me to phone a friend because doing so would make\nthe friend happy. Now suppose that my reason is best expressed as\nfollows\u2014that phoning her would make someone happy. In that case,\nthe fact that the person who is made happy is my friend is\nincidental. If phoning a stranger would have generated just as much\nhappiness then I would have had just as much reason to call the\nstranger. This in turn suggests that the principle corresponding to\nthis reason is of the form,\n\n(p, A) (If A will make someone happy then\np has reason to promote A)\n\n\nThe use of \u2018promote\u2019 in Nagel\u2019s canonical\nformulation raises some interesting issues. Nagel holds that\nperforming an action A is a trivial way of promoting\nA, so I can promote the calling of my friend by calling her.\nIn one sense, Nagel builds teleology into his conception of a reason\nfor action. For Nagel glosses \u2018promotion\u2019 in such a way\nthat the fact that an action will produce the relevant sort of outcome\nis sufficient for there being a reason to perform that action (see\nNagel 1970: 52). So every reason entails that if someone can promote\nthe relevant outcome (which outcomes are relevant may depend on the\nagents involved if the reason is agent-relative) then it logically\nfollows from Nagel\u2019s gloss of reasons in terms of promotion (in\nhis sense) that there is reason to perform that action. In another\nsense, though, Nagel does not build teleology into his conception of a\nreason for action. For Nagel does not hold that causally producing (or\neven instantiating) are necessary for there to be a reason\nfor the action. In his somewhat capacious sense of\n\u2018promote\u2019, it is sufficient for an action to count as\npromoting an outcome if the action is such that not performing it\nwould bring about the non-occurrence of the relevant state of affairs\n(again, see Nagel 1970: 52). So actions which are necessary but not\nsufficient for a given outcome thereby count as promoting that\noutcome. So all reasons are not teleological in the sense of being\nreasons in virtue of their causally bringing about the relevant sort\nof outcome; simply preserving the possibility of that outcome is\nenough. However, all reasons are teleological in the sense that any\nreason for an agent A to X does entail that if a\nsuitable agent (who counts as suitable depends on whether the reason\nis agent-relative; if it is agent-neutral then any agent will do) can\npromote A\u2019s X-ing then there is reason for\nthem to do so. Reasons are for Nagel teleological in the sense that\nthey all entail reasons for people to perform actions in the right\ncircumstances in virtue of what states of affairs they would causally\nbring about. This is not trivial. Some conceptions of reasons do not\nhave this consequence, as in the case of those conceptions which gloss\nreasons for action in a way that does not advert to promotion at\n all.[1]\n\n\nIn any event, for Nagel, the preceding principle (and hence the\ncorresponding reason) is agent-neutral because the antecedent contains\nno use of the free-agent variable \u2018p\u2019. The reason\nis in this sense not relativized to the agent for whom it is a reason.\nHowever, we could instead hold that the fact that it is my friend who\nwould be made happy is relevant to whether I have reason to call. In\nthat case, the principle corresponding to the reason would be of the\nform,\n\n(p, A) (If A will make p\u2019s\nfriend happy then p has reason to promote A)\n\n\nThis principle is agent-relative because the free-agent variable\n\u2018p\u2019 does appear in its antecedent. Basically, if\nthe sufficient condition for the application of the reason predicate\n(the condition given by the antecedent of the principle corresponding\nto the reason) includes such a free-agent variable then the reason is\nagent-relative; otherwise it is agent-neutral. It is easy enough to\nsee that on this conception, ethical egoism is an\nagent-relative theory (and hence concerns agent-relative reasons)\nwhile objective utilitarianism is an agent-neutral theory (and hence\nconcerns agent-neutral reasons). For egoism holds that there is reason\nfor a given agent to do something just in case his doing it would\npromote his welfare. Whereas objective\nutilitarianism, see the entry on\n consequentialism,\n (on at least one version) holds that someone ought to do something\njust insofar as it promotes welfare, period (no matter whose it is).\nIt is also important to be clear that the principles Nagel has in mind\nmust be understood as the basic normative principles of a theory\nrather than the theory\u2019s account of what gives those principles\ntheir status as basic normative\n principles.[2]\n Otherwise various meta-ethical (see entry on\n metaethics)\n theories of what it is to be a reason (e.g., informed desire\naccounts) might be taken to imply agent-relativity when in fact they\nshould be understood as neutral on this issue.\n\nNagel\u2019s version of the distinction is\n\u2018principle-based\u2019 in the fairly straightforward sense that\none must first look to the principle corresponding to a given reason\nto determine whether it is agent-relative or agent-neutral. Nagel also\nmakes this clear in his later work. In The View From Nowhere\nhe holds that,\n\nIf a reason can be given a general form which does not include an\nessential reference to the person who has it, it is an\nagent-neutral reason\u2026If on the other hand, the general\nform of a reason does include an essential reference to the person who\nhas it then it is an agent-relative reason. (Nagel 1986:\n152\u2013153)\n\n\nThe context makes it relatively clear Nagel\u2019s reference to the\n\u2018general form\u2019 of a reason is a universally quantified\nprinciple corresponding to the reason of the sort he discussed in\nThe Possibility of Altruism. Derek Parfit, who is the first\none to introduce the terminology \u2018agent-relative\u2019 and\n\u2018agent-neutral\u2019 makes it even more clear that the\ndistinction is in the first instance applied to normative theories.\nHaving described a moral theory he calls C, he remarks\nthat,\n\nSince C gives to all agents common moral aims, I shall call\nC agent-neutral. Many moral theories do not take\nthis form. These theories are agent-relative, giving to\ndifferent agents, different aims (Parfit 1984: 27).\n\n\nParfit\u2019s conception of moral principles as giving agents (common\nor separate) moral aims is itself controversial. Some moral theories\ninstead understand moral principles as (at least in some cases)\nproviding constraints on how to pursue one\u2019s ends. Parfit later\nexplains how his terminology, when applied to reasons, maps onto\nNagel\u2019s:\n\nNagel\u2019s subjective reasons are reasons only for the\nagent. I call these agent-relative\u2026When I call some reason\nagent-relative, I am not claiming that this reason cannot be\na reason for other agents. All that I am claiming is that it may not\nbe. (Parfit 1984: 143)\n\n\nThis is slightly confusing. First, how does Parfit\u2019s distinction\nbetween agent-relative and agent-neutral theories map onto his\ndistinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons? The\nformer is cast in terms of common aims while the second is cast in\nterms of whether a reason for one agent must also be a reason for\nanyone else. Second, how exactly does Parfit\u2019s distinction\nbetween agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons correspond to\nNagel\u2019s version of the distinction? The former is cast in terms\nof whether a reason for one agent must also be a reason for anyone\nelse while the latter is cast in terms of the occurrence of free agent\nvariables in the sufficient condition for the application of the\nreason predicate corresponding to the reason. These are not obviously\nequivalent, yet Parfit takes his distinction to be the same as\nNagel\u2019s.\n\nThe first of these two questions is slightly easier to answer than the\nsecond. A moral theory is agent-neutral if it gives us common aims,\nbut if we have common aims then whenever there is a reason for you to\npromote an aim there will also be reason for me to promote that aim\n(if I can). So Parfit\u2019s agent-neutral moral theories provide\nagent-neutral reasons in his sense\u2014in the sense of being such\nthat a reason for one agent is guaranteed to be a reason for any agent\nsituated to promote the end which figures in that reason. By contrast,\na moral theory is agent-relative if it does not give every agent a\ncommon aim. However, if we do not have common aims then what is a\nreason for you may be no reason whatsoever for me even if I\nam in a position to promote the end which figures in that reason. So\nParfit\u2019s agent-relative moral theories provide agent-relative\nreasons in his sense\u2014reasons which are not such that a reason\nfor one agent entails a reason for any agent in a position to promote\nthe end which figures in that reason. So Parfit\u2019s agent-relative\nmoral theories concern agent-relative reasons in his sense and his\nagent-neutral moral theories concern agent-neutral reasons in his\nsense. So the use of the same terminology is no coincidence, and\npresumably Parfit would agree that the agent-relativity of a reason is\nwell understood in terms of the agent-relativity of the principle\nassociated with that reason. Indeed, the primary reason we have\nincluded Parfit\u2019s version of the distinction in this discussion\nof the principle-based version of the distinction is the suspicion\nthat his distinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons\nis really just a corollary of his distinction between agent-relative\nand agent-neutral theories. The fact that Parfit clearly thinks that\nhis distinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons is\njust the same as Nagel\u2019s distinction also suggests that\nParfit\u2019s distinction is well understood as principle-based,\nsince Nagel\u2019s version of the distinction is a paradigmatic\ninstance of a principle-based version of the distinction. The other\n(closely related) reason for including Parfit\u2019s version of the\ndistinction here is that it also shares the chief vice of\nNagel\u2019s version. As explained below, neither Nagel\u2019s nor\nParfit\u2019s version of the distinction sits well with radical forms\nof moral particularism.\n\nWhat about our second question about Parfit\u2019s distinctions,\nthough? Why should Parfit assume his version of the distinction\nbetween agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons is the same as\nNagel\u2019s even though they are not drawn in the same way? Here it\nis relevant that (in at least one sense; see above) Nagel builds\nteleology into the logical form of the reason predicate, so that a\nreason is always understood as a reason to promote something.\nGiven this conception of reasons, it does seem that Parfit\u2019s\nconception maps fairly neatly onto Nagel\u2019s. For if a reason is\nagent-relative in Nagel\u2019s sense, then whether there is a reason\nfor me to promote the state of affairs for which it is a reason will\ndepend on whether I am the agent who figures in the token reason under\nconsideration. An agent-relative reason to promote A\u2019s\nhappiness will give me a reason only if I am A or suitably\nrelated to A (e.g., there can be agent-relative reasons to\npromote the welfare of my nearest and dearest). So reasons\nwhich are agent-relative in Nagel\u2019s sense are agent-relative in\nParfit\u2019s sense. By contrast, if a reason is agent-neutral in\nNagel\u2019s sense then it gives any agent who can promote the state\nof affairs it favors a reason to promote that state of affairs. In\nNagel\u2019s colorful phrase, agent-neutral reasons in his sense\ntransfer \u201cacross the gap between persons\u201d (Nagel 1970:\n79). So reasons that are agent-neutral in Nagel\u2019s sense are\nagent-neutral in Parfit\u2019s sense as well. Moreover, so long as we\nassume that all reasons are teleological, any reason which is\nagent-relative in Parfit\u2019s sense is agent-relative in\nNagel\u2019s sense and any reason that is agent-neutral in\nParfit\u2019s sense is agent-neutral in Nagel\u2019s sense. For\nplausibly the only way a reason for one person to promote X\ncould fail to also provide someone else who could promote X a\nreason to do so would be if the reason was indexed to me in the way\nNagel\u2019s agent-relative reasons are. So long as we hold onto the\nassumption that all reasons for action are teleological,\nParfit\u2019s version of the distinction and Nagel\u2019s version of\nthe distinction are at least extensionally equivalent in all possible\nworlds in spite of their rather different formulations of the\ndistinction.\n\nIn different ways, both Nagel and Parfit formulate the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in terms of general\nprinciples and the distinctions they draw do indeed seem useful and\nimportant (more on why they are useful and important below). For a\nmore explicit defense of drawing the distinction in terms of general\nprinciples (or \u2018rules\u2019 in their terminology), see also\nMcNaughton and Rawling\n 1991.[3]\n However, one unfortunate consequence of these classical\nprinciple-based ways of drawing the distinction is that they are\nincompatible with radical forms of particularism of the sort\nrecently defended by Jonathan Dancy and others. There are actually\nmany forms of moral particularism (see Jonathan Dancy\u2019s entry on\nparticularism in this Encyclopedia; see also McKeever and Ridge 2005a,\n2016), but particularists are united in their embrace of holism in the\ntheory of reasons. On a holistic conception of reasons, a\nconsideration which functions as a reason in one context need not\nfunction as a reason at all in another context. For example, that my\ncalling my friend would give him pleasure may be a reason here, but\nnot a reason in another context (perhaps his pleasure would be purely\nsadistic in the second case, taking pleasure in some misfortune of\nmine). The atomist impulse is to build whatever is necessary for the\nconsideration\u2019s status as a reason into the reason itself, so\nthat whatever is a reason in one context is thereby guaranteed to be a\nreason in any other context as well. So in the preceding example, the\natomist would insist that the second example just shows that we\nmischaracterized the reason in the first case. The real reason to call\nmy friend in the first case is not merely that it will give him\npleasure but rather that it will give him innocent pleasure, and that\nconsideration is not present in the second case. Particularists argue\nat some length that we should resist this atomistic impulse and stick\nwith the more natural characterization of the reason in the first case\nand accept a holistic conception of reasons. Particularists then argue\nthat holism in the theory of reasons in turn supports the conclusion\nthat morality is not well understood in terms of principles (for\ncritical discussion of this move, see McKeever and Ridge 2005b).\n\nParticularism is an interesting position and it would be a shame if\nsome plausible version of the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction\nwere not compatible with the leading ideas behind particularism.\nHowever, it seems that both Nagel\u2019s and Parfit\u2019s versions\nof the distinction do not sit well with particularism. This is most\nclear in the case of Nagel. His doctrine of the universality of\nreasons directly contradicts holism about reasons yet plays an\nessential role in his account of what he calls the \u2018general\nform\u2019 of a reason which in turn plays an essential role in his\nversion of the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction.\nParfit\u2019s distinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral\ntheories of course presupposes that we should think about morality in\nterms of normative theories, which also contradicts many forms of\nparticularism. Finally, Parfit\u2019s distinction between\nagent-relative and agent-neutral reasons holds that a reason is\nagent-neutral only if it is guaranteed to provide a reason for any\nagent who can promote the end which figures in the reason (again, we\nare assuming all reasons are teleological and hence always involve an\nend). Particularists will reject the idea that just because something\nis a reason for one agent it thereby must be a reason for any other\nagent who can promote the end which figures in the reason. For on a\nholistic conception of how reasons function, there may be some further\naspect of another agent\u2019s situation which cancels the force of\nthis consideration as a reason even though he could promote the\nrelevant end. If this is right then for this sort of particularism it\nwill follow trivially that all reasons are agent-relative and this\nmakes the distinction useless for their purposes. So perhaps\nunsurprisingly, the principle-based version of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction does not seem like a\npromising one if we want to make sure that the distinction is useful\nto particularists as well as their generalist opponents. We should\ntherefore consider whether either the reason-statement-based version\nof the distinction or the perspective-based version of the distinction\nare more likely to be available to particularists as well while still\ndoing roughly the same sort of important philosophical work that Nagel\nand Parfit had in mind.\n",
