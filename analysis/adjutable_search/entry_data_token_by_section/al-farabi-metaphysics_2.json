F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ontology: the Book of Letters and On the One and Unity\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s most widely-known and perhaps\nbest-understood work, the Principles of the Opinions of the People\nof the Perfect City, and his often similar Political\nRegime, presuppose analyses of being and unity in arguing for\nconclusions about God and his attributes and his causality; but\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee makes these analyses fully explicit only in\ntwo much less widely known and less well-understood texts, the\nKit\u00e2b al-\u1e25ur\u00fbf = Book of Letters\nand On the One and Unity, which are intended to be read\ntogether. Both of these texts were edited for the first time by Muhsin\nMahdi, the Book of Letters in 1969 and On the One and\nUnity in 1989; only partial translations of the Book of\nLetters, and no translations at all of On the One and\nUnity, have been published in English or any western European\n language.[14]\n Both texts are difficult, and at least the Book of Letters\npresents serious textual problems; there have been few studies of\nOn the One and Unity, and most studies of the Book of\nLetters have focussed on its socio-political rather than\nmetaphysical\n sections.[15]\n So what is said here must remain tentative.\n",
