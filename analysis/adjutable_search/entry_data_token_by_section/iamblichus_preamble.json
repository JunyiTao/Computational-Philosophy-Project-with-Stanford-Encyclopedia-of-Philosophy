    "main_text": "\n\nIamblichus (ca. 242\u2013ca. 325) was a Syrian Neoplatonist and\ndisciple of Porphyry of Tyre, the editor of Plotinus\u2019 works. One\nof the three major representatives of early Neoplatonism (the third\none being Plotinus himself), he exerted considerable influence among\nlater philosophers belonging to the same tradition, such as Proclus,\nDamascius, and Simplicius. His work as a Pagan theologian and exegete\nearned him high praise and made a decisive contribution to the\ntransformation of Plotinian metaphysics into the full-fledged system\nof the fifth-century school of Athens, at that time the major school\nof philosophy, along with the one in Alexandria. His harsh critique of\nPlotinus\u2019 philosophical tenets is linked to his pessimistic\noutlook on the condition of the human soul, as well as to his advocacy\nof salvation by ritual means, known as \u201ctheurgy\u201d.\n",
