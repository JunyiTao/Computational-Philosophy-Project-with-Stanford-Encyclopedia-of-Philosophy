    "main_text": "Substances, Elements, and Chemical Combination || Mendeleev\u2019s Periodic Table\n1.3 Mendeleev\u2019s Periodic Table\n\nLavoisier\u2019s list of elements was corrected and elaborated with the\ndiscovery of many new elements in the 19th century. For example,\nHumphrey Davy (1778\u20131829) isolated sodium and potassium by\nelectrolysis, demonstrating that Lavoisier\u2019s earths were actually\ncompounds. In addition, caloric disappeared from the list of accepted\nelements with the discovery of the first law of thermodynamics in the\n1840s. Thus with this changing, but growing, number of elements,\nchemists increasingly recognized the need for a systematization. Many\nattempts were made, but an early influential account was given by John\nNewlands (1837\u201398) who prepared the first periodic table showing\nthat 62 of the 63 then known elements follow an \u201coctave\u201d\nrule according to which every eighth element has similar\nproperties.\n\nLater, Lothar Meyer (1830\u201395) and Dmitrij Mendeleev\n(1834\u20131907) independently presented periodic tables covering all\n63 elements known in 1869. In 1871, Mendeleev published his periodic\ntable in the form it was subsequently acclaimed. This table was\norganized on the idea of periodically recurring general features as\nthe elements are followed when sequentially ordered by relative atomic\nweight. The periodically recurring similarities of chemical behavior\nprovided the basis of organizing elements into groups. He identified 8\nsuch groups across 12 horizontal periods, which, given that he was\nworking with just 63 elements, meant there were several holes.\n\n\nFigure 1.\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\u2019s Periodic\nTable of the Elements.\n\n\nThe modern Periodic Table depicted in Figure 1 is based on Mendeleev\u2019s\ntable, but now includes 92 naturally occurring elements and some dozen\nartificial elements (see Scerri 2006). The lightest element,\nhydrogen, is difficult to place, but is generally placed at the top of\nthe first group. Next comes helium, the lightest of the noble gases,\nwhich were not discovered until the end of the 19th\ncentury. Then the second period begins with lithium, the first of the\ngroup 1 (alkali metal) elements. As we cross the second period,\nsuccessively heavier elements are first members of other groups until\nwe reach neon, which is a noble gas like helium. Then with the next\nheaviest element sodium we return to the group 1 alkali metals and\nbegin the third period, and so on.\n\nOn the basis of his systematization, Mendeleev was able to correct the\nvalues of the atomic weights of certain known elements and also to\npredict the existence of then unknown elements corresponding to gaps\nin his Periodic Table. His system first began to seriously attract\nattention in 1875 when he was able to point out that gallium, the\nnewly discovered element by Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1838\u20131912),\nwas the same as the element he predicted under the name eka-aluminium,\nbut that its density should be considerably greater than the value\nLecoq de Boisbaudran reported. Repeating the measurement proved\nMendeleev to be right. The discovery of scandium in 1879 and germanium\nin 1886 with the properties Mendeleev predicted for what he called\n\u201ceka-bor\u201d and \u201ceka-silicon\u201d were further\ntriumphs (Scerri 2006).\n\nIn addition to providing the systematization of the elements used in\nmodern chemistry, Mendeleev also gave an account of the nature of\nelements which informs contemporary philosophical understanding. He\nexplicitly distinguished between the end of analysis and actual\ncomponents conceptions of elements and while he thought that both\nnotions have chemical importance, he relied on the actual components\nthesis when constructing the Periodic Table. He assumed that the\nelements remained present in compounds and that the weights of\ncompounds is the sum of the weights of their constituent atoms. He was\nthus able to use atomic weights as the primary ordering property of\nthe Periodic\n Table.[3]\n\nNowadays, chemical nomenclature, including the definition of the\nelement, is regulated by The International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC). In 1923, IUPAC followed Mendeleev and standardized\nthe individuation criteria for the elements by explicitly endorsing\nthe actual components thesis. Where they differed from Mendeleev is in\nwhat property they thought could best individuate the elements. Rather\nthan using atomic weights, they ordered elements according to\natomic number, the number of protons and of electrons of\nneutral elemental atoms, allowing for the occurrence of\nisotopes with the same atomic number but different atomic\nweights. They chose to order elements by atomic number because of the\ngrowing recognition that electronic structure was the atomic feature\nresponsible for governing how atoms combine to form molecules, and the\nnumber of electrons is governed by the requirement of overall\nelectrical neutrality (Kragh 2000).\n",
