    "main_text": "Subject Matter and Methodology || Varieties of moral experience\n1.1 Varieties of moral experience\n\nHere we wish to propose in a somewhat preliminary way a general\ntaxonomy of types of moral experience\u2014a taxonomy that is\nintended to cover the territory well enough and is useful for thinking\nabout the subject matter of moral phenomenology.\n\nMoral perception includes moral experiences that crucially\ninvolve the use of one\u2019s perceptual faculties, ocular and\nauditory being the most obvious. An example of visual moral perception\nis seeing someone gleefully torture a helpless animal and experiencing\nthat action as morally wrong. Hearing someone utter a deliberately\ninsulting remark and recognizing it as such is an example of a moral\nexperience grounded in auditory perception. Understood more narrowly\n(and quite literally) moral perception, as understood by its\ndefenders, involves (what appears to one as) an instantiated moral\nproperty (i.e., an instance of a moral property possessed by an object\nof moral evaluation) being presented in one\u2019s perceptual\nexperience, as when one\u2019s visual perceptual experience presents\nthe injustice of a perceived action (see, for example, Audi\n 2013).[2]\n Moral perception, so understood, is to be distinguished (at least\nprima facie) from spontaneous, perceptually grounded moral\nbelief as when one sees someone slap a small child triggering the\nbelief that the slapping was morally wrong. Arguably, the content of\none\u2019s visual experience need not include the presentation of the\nproperty wrongness. (For further discussion of this issue, see\n section 2.1.)\n\nMoral emotions, both positive (e.g., gratitude, respect,\nadmiration) and negative (e.g., shame, guilt, indignation) are mental\nstates of moral significance that often have, when occurrent, a\nrobust, arguably complex, phenomenal character. In the empirical\nliterature, for example, one finds experimental studies of the\ndifferences in people\u2019s experiences of envy compared to\n jealousy,[3]\n of guilt compared to\n shame,[4]\n as well as studies of people\u2019s experiences of gratitude, of\ngenerosity, of disrespect, and other emotions. Note that if, as many\ntheoreticians of emotion suppose, moral judgments are embedded in\nthese emotions (or some instances of them), then the phenomenology of\nmoral emotion will overlap with the phenomenology of moral judgment.\nFor theorists who liken the emotions to perception, the phenomenology\nof moral emotion will overlap with the phenomenology of moral\nperception. Of course, for many theorists, the phenomenology of moral\nemotion will intersect both moral perception and moral judgment.\n\nMoral judgment is understood as occurrent experiences of\nthinking a moral proposition, whether it is about oneself, including\none\u2019s actions, past, present, or in prospect, or about\none\u2019s character, past, present, or future, or whether it is\nabout the actions or character of others, or whether it is about the\nstructures and behaviors of institutions. Within this category, many\nfurther divisions of phenomenological significance are called for. On\nphenomenological grounds, Maurice Mandelbaum (1955) distinguished what\nhe referred to as \u201cdirect\u201d from \u201cremoved\u201d\nmoral judgments\u2014intended to capture the difference in the\nphenomenologies of perspective between first and third-person moral\njudgment. He also found reason on phenomenological grounds to\ndistinguish judgments of obligation (and deontic judgments generally)\nfrom judgments of value. One might also suppose that spontaneous moral\njudgments (intuitions) typically have a different experiential aspect\nto them compared to moral judgments that are the deliverances of moral\n deliberation.[5]\n\nMoral deliberation includes formulating moral propositions\nand considering their plausibility (e.g., mulling them over, thinking\nabout reasons for and against), typically aimed at reaching a moral\nverdict about some issue. This category focuses on the conscious\nprocess often leading up to forming a moral judgment or leading up to\na decision to act based on one\u2019s deliberations\u2014both\ntypical products of this process.\n\nMoral agency involves exercising one\u2019s capacity to act,\nincluding the experience of making moral decisions (an exercise of\nwill), as well as experiences of planning, trying, striving, and\nacting in ways that have moral significance. Julia Annas (2008)\ndiscusses the experiences of a virtuous agent that she describes in\nterms of the sort of \u201cflow\u201d experience that is extensively\nexplored in the work of Csikszentmihalyi (1990). Hubert and Stuart\nDreyfus discuss what they call \u201cethical comportment\u201d, a\ndeveloped skill-like capacity in which an agent who has reached the\nrequisite level of moral expertise can see \u201cintuitively what to\ndo without applying rules and making judgments at all\u201d (1990:\n 243).[6]\n\nNotice two things about this taxonomy. First, these categories of\nmoral experience are porous, as indicated in what we have noted about\nthe possible involvement of moral judgment in experiencing moral\nemotions. Moral deliberation most often includes moral judgments that\none may or may not bring to mind in mulling over some moral issue to\nreach a verdict about that issue. Second, as indicated in the remarks\nabout moral judgment, there are more fine-grained distinctions one\nmight draw within and across the basic types of moral experience we\nhave just presented (e.g., direct vs. removed moral judgments) that\nmay be of phenomenological significance. The above taxonomy represents\nonly a rough guide to the most general types of moral experience. In\n section 3\n and\n 4,\n we return to the work that has been done investigating some of these\nspecies of moral experience as it bears on issues in metaethics and\nnormative ethics.\n",
