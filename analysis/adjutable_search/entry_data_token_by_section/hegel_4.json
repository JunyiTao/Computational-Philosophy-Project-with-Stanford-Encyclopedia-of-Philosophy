    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Philosophy || The post-Kantian (sometimes called the non-metaphysical) view of Hegel\n2.3 The post-Kantian (sometimes called the non-metaphysical) view of Hegel\nLeast controversially, it is often claimed that either\nparticular works, such as the Phenomenology of\nSpirit, or particular areas of Hegel\u2019s philosophy,\nespecially his ethical and political philosophy, can be understood as\nstanding independently of the type of unacceptable metaphysical system\nsketched above. Thus it is commonly asserted that implicit within the\nmetaphysical Hegel is an anti-metaphysical philosopher struggling to\nget out\u2014one potentially capable of beating the critical Kant at\nhis own game.\nMore controversially, one now finds it argued that the traditional\npicture is simply wrong at a more general level, and that Hegel, even\nin his systematic thought, was not committed to the bizarre,\nteleological spirit monism that has been traditionally\nattributed to him because he was free of the type of traditional\nmetaphysical commitments that had been criticized by Kant. Prominent\namong such interpretations has been the so-called\npost-Kantian interpretation advanced by North American\nHegel scholars Robert Pippin (1989, 2008, 2019) and Terry Pinkard\n(1994, 2000, 2012). From an explicitly analytic perspective, broadly\nsimilar views have been put forward by Robert Brandom (2002, 2014,\n2019) and John McDowell (2006, 2018). Thus while the traditional view sees\nHegel as exemplifying the very type of metaphysical speculation that\nKant successfully criticised, the post-Kantian view regards him as\nboth accepting and extending Kant\u2019s critique,\nultimately turning it against the residual dogmatically\nmetaphysical aspects of Kant\u2019s own philosophy.\nIn Hegel, the non-traditionalists argue, one can see the ambition\nto bring together the universalist dimensions of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental program with the culturally contextualist conceptions\nof his more historically and relativistically-minded contemporaries,\nresulting in his controversial conception of spirit, as\ndeveloped in his Phenomenology of Spirit. With this notion,\nit is claimed, Hegel was essentially attempting to answer the Kantian\nquestion of the conditions of rational human mindedness,\nrather than being concerned with giving an account of the developing\nself-consciousness of God. But while Kant had limited such conditions\nto formal abstractly conceived structures of the mind,\nHegel extended them to include aspects of historically and socially\ndetermined forms of embodied human existence.\n",
