    "main_text": "Degrees of Personhood\n1. Degrees of Personhood\n\n\nIn an attempt to express the essence of the Akan concept of persons,\nKwasi Wiredu refers to former Zambian President Kaunda's praise\nof former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as \u201ctruly a\nperson.\u201d The concept of person to which Kaunda referred has a\nparticular significance within the African cultural context. As Kaunda\nexplains, \u201cpersonhood is not an automatic quality of the human\nindividual; it is something to be achieved, the higher the\nachievement, the higher the credit\u201d (Wiredu 1992, 104).  The\nview of personhood as a matter of degrees, as exemplified in\nKaunda's remark, is also a defining characteristic of the Akan\nnotion of personhood.\n\n\nThe Akan word onipa is an ambiguous term, sometimes referring\nto a member of a biological species and sometimes referring instead to\na human who has attained a special kind of social status (Wiredu\n1992).  According to Wiredu, this dual meaning reflects an important\nconceptual distinction between a human\u2014a biological\nentity\u2014and a person\u2014an entity with special moral\nand metaphysical qualities. Status as a human is not susceptible to\ndegrees, nor is such status conferred on an individual as a\n\u2018reward\u2019 for her efforts. One is either a human or one is\nnot\u2014there is no such thing as becoming a human. In\ncontrast, personhood is something for a human to become to different\ndegrees through individual achievement. An individual's human\n status, then, is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for\n personhood.[1]\n\n\nUnder this interpretation, the \u2018payoff\u2019 for attaining\nhigher degrees of personhood is directly related to rights and\nprivileges that can make a significant difference between success\n and\n failure.[2]\n The more\nrights and privileges an individual enjoys, the more social capital\nthat individual acquires (in the form of access to lineal networks and\nthe resources they control). A person\u2014taken in its fullest\nsense\u2014is therefore an individual who, through mature reflection\nand action, has both flourished economically and succeeded in meeting\nher (often weighty) responsibilities to her family and community.\n\n\nThe distinctive qualities of this concept of persons (as interpreted by\nWiredu) are brought out when contrasted to the analysis of another\nleading African philosopher, Kwame Gyekye, who takes issue with this\ngraduated conception of person. Gyekye specifically objects to the role\nthat social status plays in Wiredu's view of personhood, arguing\nthat that is inconsistent with the natural or innate moral equality of\npersons derived from their common humanity. That is, we are human\npersons before we are anything else and it is the human person that\nmatters from the moral point of view. Not surprisingly, Gyekye quotes\nKant's categorical imperative approvingly when arguing that human\npersons are, as members of the \u2018kingdom of ends,\u2019 equal\nindependent of their empirical or accidental characteristics (be they\nsocial or even genetic qualities.\n\n\nAccording to Gyekye, it is our essentially human capacity for\nreason\u2014not other fortuitous or accidental predicates\u2014that\nserves as the basis for moral worth. In this respect, one cannot point\nto such accidental characteristics as height, gender, age, marital\nstatus, or social class as basis for personhood:\n\n\n[W]hat a person acquires are status, habits, and personality or\ncharacter traits: he, qua person acquires and thus becomes\nthe subject of acquisition, and being thus prior to\nacquisition process, he cannot be defined by what he acquires. One is\na person because of what he is, not because of what he acquires\n(Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 108).\n\n\nGyekye is quick to note that there are some Akan expressions and\njudgments about the life and conduct of people that appear to give the\nimpression that personhood is something that is acquired or bestowed\nupon one in virtue of taken responsibility in the community. For\nexample, Onnye \u2018nipa is a moral judgmental expression\nused among the Akan to describe someone who appears in his conduct to\nbe wicked, bad, and ungenerous to others. In fact, a person of high\nmoral standards or conduct would be described approvingly as oye\nonipa paa\u2014literally, she is a real (human) person. In\ncontrast, an individual who fails in his striving in the Akan community\nmay be judged as onipa hun, which literally means\n\u201cuseless person,\u201d an opprobrious expression.\n\n\nAccording to Gyekye, however, these locutions should not be taken\nliterally, but instead merely to reflect \u201cstatus, habits, and\npersonality or character traits\u201d that one acquires over the\ncourse of the one's life, not personhood (Wiredu & Gyekye\n1992, 108).  For Gyekye, personhood is prior to and independent of\nsuch acquisitions. To conceive of personhood as a continuous property\ncapable of degrees is to confuse conventional notions of\nstatus\u2014a highly variable quantity\u2014with the notion of\npersonhood, a constant for all human persons.\n\n\nThe relationship between Wiredu's and Gyekye's analyses of\npersonhood is brought out more clearly by considering the status of\ninfants, vis-a-vis personhood. Akan linguistic conventions distinguish\ninfants from full persons on the basis of their lacking intellectual\nand moral maturity. This aspect reflects the continuous character of\npersonhood stressed by Wiredu. Yet the infant (or onipa) is\nalso accorded a baseline level of respect by virtue of her possessing\nthe okra. In that respect, an infant is entitled to the\nrespect due to any other human, regardless of age, or\n capability. (Wiredu & Gyekye 1992)\n\n\nAs interpreted by Wiredu, these conventions clearly indicate that\ncertain kinds of achievements\u2014be they moral, intellectual, or\nsocial\u2014are, for the Akan, constitutive of personhood,\nnot merely indicators of such status. But at the same time, Wiredu\ntakes those conventions to indicate the importance of the\ninfant's status as a human, since it entitles the\ninfant\u2014and, for that matter, all other humans\u2014to a minimum\nlevel of respect. The significance of humanity, he argues, is that it\nis a necessary (albeit not a sufficient) condition for personhood. From\nWiredu's perspective, possession of the okra confers one\ncondition of self-respect, not self-respect itself. To acquire\nself-respect itself, one must build upon that basis to achieve greater\ndegrees of moral agency, and in so doing, achieving greater degrees of\npersonhood.\n\n\nThe difference in status between those possessing merely the\nokra and those who have achieved a higher degree of personhood\ncan be thought of in terms of the difference between the quality of\nmoral agency and degrees of moral responsibility.\nAmong the Akan, phrases like onye\u2019 nipa (\u201che is\nnot a person\u201d) or onipa hun (\u201cuseless\nperson\u201d) indicate that an individual is a moral agent, one that\nis equal to all others with respect to having the potential for full\npersonhood\u2014albeit a potential that the individual has not\nrealized. In fact, to pass a judgment that someone is an\nonye\u2019 nipa is a way of respecting the person as a moral\nagent; not holding an adult responsible in this way would be tantamount\nto failing to respect their moral agency.\n\n\nThe two levels of personhood (one discrete, the other continuous)\nposited by Wiredu allows him to account for much of the social and\nlinguistic data while also satisfying many of the moral intuitions\nunderlying Gyekye's own purely discrete interpretation. Think\nagain, for example, about the concept of a human being. As explicated\nby Wiredu, what makes an entity a human being is simply his or her\npossession of the okra. This can be translated into\nGyekye's Kantian parlance as the claim that one's status as\nnot just a human being but as a moral agent rests solely on one's\ncapacity for reason. The normative implication of possession of the\nokra or the capacity for rationality is that the entity is\nentitled to an irreducible respect matched by irreducible\nrights\u2014like the negative right not to be killed unjustly, or the\npositive right to be given what is needed to sustain life. The social\nbases of personhood supplement this minimum level of inherent\nrespect. In this wise one can say that all persons are human\nbeings but not all human beings are persons. At bottom, all human\nbeings are potential moral agents. This is a status (capacity for\nrationality and morality) that a colt cannot be accorded because even a\nhorse cannot become a moral agent. An infant can.\n\n\nThe implications of the two-tiered view of personhood presented by\nWiredu are nicely illustrated by Akan practices following the death of\nan infant. Despite the obviously tragic circumstances of such a death,\nno funeral ceremonies are permitted in Akan society for infants.\nAccording to Wiredu, the reason for this naturally follows from the\nminimal level of personhood achieved by infants: It isn't that\ninfants are not valued or cherished by the Akan; rather, it is that\nthey are just not the kind of individual for whom such a ceremony is\nappropriate. The Akan funeral is a form of send-off for the departing\nsoul on the journey to the ancestral world\u2014a journey for which a\nchild does not qualify because she hasn't attained personhood.\nThus, the death of a child is not a time for mourning. Instead, parents\nare expected to behave normally and cheerfully.\n\n\nThe different treatment accorded to deceased adults and children is a\nmanifestation of what we can refer to as the Akan theory of selective\nreincarnation, a view that postulates that otherwise deserving humans\nwho have failed to fulfill their potential for achieving a higher\ndegree of personhood a second chance in the\n world.[3]\n For the Akan, those who die in\ninfancy are obvious candidates for this form of reincarnation, since\nthey have failed to make good on their potential but not through any\nlack of effort on their part. In that respect they are what Wiredu\ncalls \u2018limbo people,\u2019 humans with an untapped potential for\nfull personhood and the opportunity to return to life to make good on\nthat potential.\n\n\nOn its face, the theory of selective reincarnation may appear to be\nnothing more than a curious feature of Akan cosmology. As presented by\nWiredu, however, it is part of a general process of making moral\nagents. Appreciating the role of selective reincarnation among the Akan\nthus requires acknowledging the whole process by which morally\nresponsible agents come to be, as well as how individuals become\nmotivated to be moral. Critical to this appreciation is the\nunderstanding that the entity underlying this process exists beyond the\nlife of a physical human being. The okra that forms the\n\u2018core\u2019 of the human being (and the returns through the\nprocess of selective reincarnation) precedes one's life as a\nhuman and constitutes one end of this process. At the other end\nis the Akan ancestor, the culmination of the process of becoming a\nperson whose memory serves as a moral exemplar to the living that\nguides the moral journey of the Akan. Those who become ancestors are\nthose who, through their imagination, intelligence, and empathetic\nidentification with their fellow human beings, excel not in spite of\nbut because of all the challenges that are put before them. After\nhaving lived a full life, they obtain their \u2018ticket\u2019 (to\nuse Wiredu's imagery) to the ancestral world and are reincarnated\ninto service-ancestors.\n\n\nGyekye rejects this explanation, along with Wiredu's analysis of\nAkan personhood. He argues instead that any such explanation of Akan\nsocial and linguistic conventions must presume the personhood of even\nthe youngest human:\n\n\n[A] human person is a person whatever his age or social\nstatus. Personhood may reach its full realization in community, but it\nis not acquired or yet to be achieved as one goes along in society.\nWhat a person acquires are status, habits, and personality or\ncharacter traits: he, qua person, thus becomes the\nsubject of acquisition, and being thus prior to the\nacquisition, he cannot be defined by what he acquires. One is a person\nbecause of what he is not because of what he has acquired (Wiredu\n& Gyekye 1992, 108 note 22).\n\n\nFor Gyekye, then, differences with respect to personhood cannot\naccount for the difference in how the Akan deal with the death of\ninfants and adults. He prefers instead to account for these differences\nin terms of the utilitarian value of cultural practices such as the\ndifferent treatment of the deaths of infants and adults. The most\nobvious reason for the difference, according to Gyekye, is that the\nsize and magnitude of death celebration depends on the social status of\nthe deceased\n individual.[4]\n The death of a wealthy and well-connected\nperson will naturally call for a more elaborate ceremony than the death\nof a newborn, quite independently of their status as persons.\n\n\nThis is not to say that Gyekye denies the role that the idea\nof reincarnation plays for the Akan in the formation of persons. For\nhim, however, the idea of reincarnation (and of the graduated concept\nof personhood) is less a factual account of personhood than a moral\nnarrative, such as the ones postulated by Aquinas, Kant, Bentham, and\nJohn Stuart Mill to explain and justify moral precepts. The central\nnarratives of Western moral philosophy (such as the social contract)\nprovide vivid images that motivate individuals to act in certain ways.\nIn the same way, the Akan narratives of reincarnation and personhood\nserve to reinforce socially valuable traits and practices such as\ncooperation and industriousness.\n\n\nFrom this perspective, the sage Akan elders who insure death\ncelebrations for full persons grasp what a casual onlooker might often\noverlook\u2014namely, that the most important effects of a death\ncelebration are on the onlookers, rather than the deceased. What might\nbe called the expressive content of public action\u2014the message to\nthe Akan community conveyed by the ritual and symbolic performance, the\npublic utterances of the Akan leaders\u2014is the most important\neffect of such ceremonies. These ceremonies are a powerful symbolic\nmechanism for both expressing and shaping the values and beliefs of the\nAkan people. Thus, the Akan may abstain from mourning a rapist or a\nmurderer to express their collective abhorrence of the offending\nact.\n",
