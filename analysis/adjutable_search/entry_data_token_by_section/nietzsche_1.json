    "main_text": "Critique of Religion and Morality\n2. Critique of Religion and Morality\n\nNietzsche is arguably most famous for his criticisms of traditional\nEuropean moral commitments, together with their foundations in\nChristianity. This critique is very wide-ranging; it aims to undermine\nnot just religious faith or philosophical moral theory, but\nalso many central aspects of ordinary moral consciousness, some of\nwhich are difficult to imagine doing without (e.g., altruistic\nconcern, guilt for wrongdoing, moral responsibility, the value of\ncompassion, the demand for equal consideration of persons, and so\non).\n\nBy the time Nietzsche wrote, it was common for European intellectuals\nto assume that such ideas, however much inspiration they owed to the\nChristian intellectual and faith tradition, needed a rational\ngrounding independent from particular sectarian or even ecumenical\nreligious commitments. Then as now, most philosophers assumed that a\nsecular vindication of morality would surely be forthcoming and would\nsave the large majority of our standard commitments. Nietzsche found\nthat confidence na\u00efve, and he deployed all his rhetorical prowess\nto shock his readers out of complacency on this score. For example,\nhis doubts about the viability of Christian underpinnings for moral\nand cultural life are not offered in a sunny spirit of anticipated\nliberation, nor does he present a sober but basically confident call\nto develop a secular understanding of morality; instead, he launches\nthe famous, aggressive and paradoxical pronouncement that \u201cGod\nis dead\u201d (GS 108, 125, 343). The idea is not so much\nthat atheism is true\u2014in GS 125, he depicts this\npronouncement arriving as fresh news to a group of\natheists\u2014but instead that because \u201cthe belief in the\nChristian God has become unbelievable\u201d, everything that was\n\u201cbuilt upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it\u201d,\nincluding \u201cthe whole of our European morality\u201d,\nis destined for \u201ccollapse\u201d (GS 343). Christianity\nno longer commands society-wide cultural allegiance as a framework\ngrounding ethical commitments, and thus, a common basis for collective\nlife that was supposed to have been immutable and invulnerable has\nturned out to be not only less stable than we assumed, but\nincomprehensibly mortal\u2014and in fact, already lost. The\nresponse called for by such a turn of events is mourning and deep\ndisorientation.\n\nIndeed, the case is even worse than that, according to Nietzsche. Not\nonly do standard moral commitments lack a foundation we thought they\nhad, but stripped of their veneer of unquestionable authority, they\nprove to have been not just baseless but positively harmful.\nUnfortunately, the moralization of our lives has insidiously attached\nitself to genuine psychological needs\u2014some basic to our\ncondition, others cultivated by the conditions of life under\nmorality\u2014so its corrosive effects cannot simply be removed\nwithout further psychological damage. Still worse, the damaging side\nof morality has implanted itself within us in the form of a\ngenuine self-understanding, making it hard for us to imagine\nourselves living any other way. Thus, Nietzsche argues, we are faced\nwith a difficult, long term restoration project in which the most\ncherished aspects of our way of life must be ruthlessly investigated,\ndismantled, and then reconstructed in healthier form\u2014all while\nwe continue somehow to sail the ship of our common ethical life on the\nhigh seas.\n\nThe most extensive development of this Nietzschean critique of\nmorality appears in his late work On the Genealogy of\nMorality, which consists of three treatises, each devoted to the\npsychological examination of a central moral idea. In the First\nTreatise, Nietzsche takes up the idea that moral consciousness\nconsists fundamentally in altruistic concern for others. He begins by\nobserving a striking fact, namely, that this widespread conception of\nwhat morality is all about\u2014while entirely\ncommonsensical\u2014is not the essence of any possible morality, but\na historical innovation.\n\nTo make the case for historical change, he identifies two patterns of\nethical assessment, each associated with a basic pair of evaluative\nterms, a good/bad pattern and a good/evil pattern. Understood\naccording to the good/bad pattern, the idea of goodness originated in\nsocial class privilege: the good were first understood to be those of\nthe higher social order, but then eventually the idea of goodness was\n\u201cinternalized\u201d\u2014i.e., transferred from social class\nitself to traits of character and other personal excellences that were\ntypically associated with the privileged caste (for example, the\nvirtue of courage for a society with a privileged military class, or\nmagnanimity for one with a wealthy elite, or truthfulness and\n(psychological) nobility for a culturally ambitious aristocracy; see\nGM I, 4\u20135). In such a system, goodness is associated\nwith exclusive virtues. There is no thought that everyone\nshould be excellent\u2014the very idea makes no sense, since to be\nexcellent is to be distinguished from the ordinary run of people. In\nthat sense, good/bad valuation arises out of a \u201cpathos of\ndistance\u201d (GM I, 2) expressing the superiority\nexcellent people feel over ordinary ones, and it gives rise to a\n\u201cnoble morality\u201d (BGE 260). Nietzsche shows\nconvincingly that this pattern of assessment was dominant in ancient\nMediterranean culture (the Homeric world, later Greek and Roman\nsociety, and even much of ancient philosophical ethics).\n\nThe good/evil pattern of valuation is quite different. It focuses its\nnegative evaluation (evil) on violations of the interests or\nwell-being of others\u2014and consequently its positive evaluation\n(good) on altruistic concern for their welfare. Such a morality has\nuniversalistic pretensions: if it is to promote and protect the\nwelfare of all, its restrictions and injunctions must apply to\neveryone equally. It is thereby especially amenable to ideas of basic\nhuman equality, starting from the thought that each person has an\nequal claim to moral consideration and respect. These are familiar\nideas in the modern context\u2014so familiar, indeed, that Nietzsche\nobserves how easily we confuse them with \u201cthe moral manner of\nvaluation as such\u201d (GM Pref., 4)\u2014but the\nuniversalist structure, altruistic sentiments, and egalitarian\ntendency of those values mark an obvious contrast with the valuation\nof exclusive virtues in the good/bad pattern. The contrast, together\nwith the prior dominance of good/bad structured moralities, raises a\nstraightforward historical question: what happened? How did we get\nfrom the widespread acceptance of good/bad valuation to the near\nuniversal dominance of good/evil thinking?\n\nNietzsche\u2019s famous answer is unflattering to our modern\nconception. He insists that the transformation was the result of a\n\u201cslave revolt in morality\u201d (GM I, 10; cf.\nBGE 260). The exact nature of this alleged revolt is a matter\nof ongoing scholarly controversy (in recent literature, see Bittner\n1994; Reginster 1997, 2021; Migotti 1998; Ridley 1998; May 1999:\n41\u201354; Janaway 2007: 90\u2013106, 223\u20139; Owen 2007:\n78\u201389; Wallace 2007; Anderson 2011; Poellner 2011; Leiter 2015:\n155\u201377; Snelson 2017; Jenkins 2018; Huddleston 2021), but the\nbroad outline is clear enough. People who suffered from oppression at\nthe hands of the noble, excellent, (but uninhibited) people valorized\nby good/bad morality\u2014and who were denied any effective recourse\nagainst them by relative powerlessness\u2014developed a persistent,\ncorrosive emotional pattern of resentful hatred against their enemies,\nwhich Nietzsche calls ressentiment. That emotion motivated\nthe development of the new moral concept evil,\npurpose-designed for the moralistic condemnation of those enemies.\n(How conscious or unconscious\u2014how \u201cstrategic\u201d or\nnot\u2014this process is supposed to have been is one matter of\nscholarly controversy.) Afterward, via negation of the concept of\nevil, the new concept of goodness emerges, rooted in altruistic\nconcern of a sort that would inhibit evil actions. Moralistic\ncondemnation using these new values does little by itself to satisfy\nthe motivating desire for revenge, but if the new way of thinking\ncould spread, gaining more adherents and eventually influencing the\nevaluations even of the nobility, then the revenge might be\nimpressive\u2014indeed, \u201cthe most spiritual\u201d form of\nrevenge (GM I, 7; see also GM I, 10\u201311). For\nin that case, the revolt would accomplish a \u201cradical\nrevaluation\u201d (GM I, 7) that would corrupt the very\nvalues that gave the noble way of life its character and made\nit seem admirable in the first place.\n\nFor Nietzsche, then, our morality amounts to a vindictive effort to\npoison the happiness of the fortunate (GM III, 14), instead\nof a high-minded, dispassionate, and strictly rational concern for\nothers. This can seem hard to accept, both as an account of how the\nvaluation of altruistic concern originated and even more as a\npsychological explanation of the basis of altruism in modern people,\nwho are far removed from the social conditions that figure in\nNietzsche\u2019s story. That said, Nietzsche offers two strands of\nevidence sufficient to give pause to an open-minded reader. In the\nChristian context, he points to the surprising prevalence of what one\nmight call the \u201cbrimstone, hellfire, and damnation\ndiatribe\u201d in Christian letters and sermons: Nietzsche cites at\nlength a striking example from Tertullian (GM I, 15), but\nthat example is the tip of a very large iceberg, and it is a troubling\npuzzle what this genre of \u201cvengeful outbursts\u201d\n(GM I, 16) is even doing within (what is supposed to be) a\nreligion of love and forgiveness. Second, Nietzsche observes with\nconfidence-shaking perspicacity how frequently indignant moralistic\ncondemnation itself, whether arising in serious criminal or public\nmatters or from more private personal interactions, can detach itself\nfrom any measured assessment of the wrong and devolve into a\nfree-floating expression of vengeful resentment against some (real or\nimagined) perpetrator. The spirit of such condemnations is\ndisturbingly often more in line with Nietzsche\u2019s diagnosis of\naltruism than it is with our conventional (but possibly\nself-satisfied) moral self-understanding.\n\nThe First Treatise does little, however, to suggest why inhabitants of\na noble morality might be at all moved by such condemnations,\ngenerating a question about how the moral revaluation could have\nsucceeded. Nothing internal to the nobles\u2019 value system gives\nthem any grounds for general altruistic concern or any reason to pay\nheed to the complaints of those whom they have already dismissed as\ncontemptible. The Second Treatise, about guilt and bad conscience,\noffers some materials toward an answer to this puzzle.\n\nNietzsche begins from the insight that guilt bears a close conceptual\nconnection to the notion of debt. Just as a debtor\u2019s failure to\nrepay gives the creditor the right to seek alternative compensation\n(whether via some remedy spelled out in a contract, or less formally,\nthrough general social or legal sanctions), so a guilty party owes the\nvictim some form of response to the violation, which serves as a kind\nof compensation for whatever harm was suffered. Nietzsche\u2019s\nconjectural history of the \u201cmoralized\u201d (GM II,\n21) notion of guilt suggests that it developed through a transfer of\nthis structure\u2014which pairs each loss to some\n(punishment-involving) compensation\u2014from the domain of material\ndebt to a wider class of actions that violate some socially accepted\nnorm. The really important conceptual transformation, however, is not\nthe transfer itself, but an accompanying purification and\ninternalization of the feeling of indebtedness, which connect\nthe demand for compensation to a source of wrongful action that is\nsupposed to be entirely within the agent\u2019s control. The\ncondemnation of the violation thereby attaches a negative assessment\nto the guilty person\u2019s basic sense of personal worth.\n\nThe highly purified character of moralized guilt suggests how it might\nbe a powerful tool for moral revaluation and simultaneously indicates\nsome of Nietzsche\u2019s reasons for skepticism against it. As\nWilliams (1993a) observes, a purified notion of guilt pertaining to\nwhat is completely under the agent\u2019s control (and so entirely\nimmune from luck) stands in a particularly tight fit with\nblame: \u201cBlame needs an occasion\u2014an\naction\u2014and a target\u2014the person who did the action and goes\non to meet the blame\u201d (Williams 1993a: 10). The pure idea of\nmoralized guilt answers this need by tying any wrong action\ninextricably and uniquely to a blamable agent. As we saw, the impulse\nto assign blame was central to the ressentiment that\nmotivated the moral revaluation of values, according to the First\nTreatise. Thus, insofar as people (even nobles) become susceptible to\nsuch moralized guilt, they might also become vulnerable to the\nrevaluation, and Nietzsche offers some speculations about how and why\nthis might happen (GM II, 16\u201317).\n\nBut Nietzsche\u2019s main concern in the Second Treatise is the\ndanger he takes moralized guilt to pose to psychological health. These\ncriticisms have attracted an increasingly subtle secondary literature;\nsee Reginster (2011, 2018, 2021), as well as Williams (1993a, b),\nRidley (1998), May (1999: 55\u201380), Risse (2001, 2005), Janaway\n(2007: 124\u201342), Owen (2007: 91\u2013112), Migotti (2013), and\nLeiter (2015: 178\u201395). One salient thought is that guilt\u2019s\nvery purity makes it liable to turn against the agent\nherself\u2014even in cases where it plays no legitimate role in\nself-regulation, or in ways that outstrip any such role. For example,\ngiven guilt\u2019s intense internalization, no connection to an\nactual victim is essential to it. Any observer of the\nviolation (whether real or ideal/imagined) can equally be entitled to\nresent the guilty party, and that fact makes space for religious or\nideological systems to attach guilt to practically any kind of rule\nviolation, even when no one was harmed. In such cases, free-floating\nguilt can lose its social and moral point and develop into a\npathological desire for self-punishment.\n\nThe Genealogy\u2019s Third Treatise explores the\nintensification of such self-punishment via the idealization of\nasceticism. Ascetic self-denial is a curious phenomenon. (Indeed, on\ncertain psychological assumptions, like descriptive psychological\negoism or ordinary hedonism, it seems incomprehensible.) But it is\nnevertheless strikingly widespread in the history of religious\npractice. The Genealogy misses no chance to criticize\nreligious versions of asceticism, but its target is\nbroader\u2014including, specifically, the more rational form\nasceticism takes in Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics. What unifies the\ndifferent versions is their extension of the valorization of\nself-discipline in the interest of virtue (which Nietzsche himself\nwould advocate) into a thoroughgoing form of self-condemnation, in\nwhich self-discipline is turned against the agent herself and comes to\nexpress the person\u2019s commitment to her own fundamental\nworthlessness. (One obvious route to such a value system, though far\nfrom the only one, is for the moralist to identify a set of drives and\ndesires that people are bound to have\u2014perhaps rooted in their\nhuman or animal nature\u2014and to condemn those as evil;\nanti-sensualist forms of asceticism follow this path.)\n\nAs Nietzsche emphasizes, purified guilt is naturally recruited as a\ntool for developing asceticism. Suffering is an inevitable part of the\nhuman condition, and the ascetic strategy is to interpret such\nsuffering as punishment, thereby connecting it to the notion\nof guilt. Despite turning her own suffering against her, the move\nparadoxically offers certain advantages to the agent\u2014not only\ndoes her suffering gain an explanation and moral justification, but\nher own activity can be validated by being enlisted on the side of\npunishment (self-castigation):\n\n\nFor every sufferer instinctively seeks a cause for his suffering;\nstill more precisely, a perpetrator, still more specifically, a\nguilty perpetrator who is susceptible to suffering,\n\n\nand\n\n\nthe ascetic priest says to him: \u201cThat\u2019s right, my sheep!\nSomeone must be to blame for it; but you yourself are this someone,\nyou alone are to blame for it\u2014you alone are to blame for\nyourself!\u201d. (GM III, 15)\n\n\nThus, Nietzsche suggests,\n\n\nThe principal bow stroke the ascetic priest allowed himself to cause\nthe human soul to resound with wrenching and ecstatic music of every\nkind was executed\u2014everyone knows this\u2014by exploiting\nthe feeling of guilt. (GM III, 20)\n\n\nGiven that guilt involves a serious diminution of personal worth, the\neffects of this guilt-inflected ascetic self-understanding must be\nextremely destructive for the agent\u2019s sense of self-worth, and\nultimately for psychological health.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s account places asceticism in an unattractive light,\nbut the ascetic conception of morality is by no means refuted by\nargument through these considerations. Consider, for example, the\nstance of Schopenhauerian pessimism, according to which human life and\nthe world have negative absolute value. From that standpoint,\nthe moralist can perfectly well allow that ascetic valuation is\nself-punishing and even destructive for the moral agent, but such\nconclusions are entirely consistent with\u2014indeed, they seem like\nwarranted responses to\u2014the pessimistic evaluation. That\nis, if life is an inherent evil and nothingness is a concrete\nimprovement over existence, then diminishing or impairing life through\nasceticism yields a net enhancement of value. Nietzsche\u2019s\nconcern is not so much to refute that view as to\ndiagnose it. He insists that such evaluative commitments are\nsymptoms of psychological and cultural sickness, and that the ascetic\nresponse is an \u201cinstinctive\u201d, but ultimately\nself-defeating, effort at self-medication (GM III, 13, 16).\nWhile asceticism imposes self-discipline on the sick practitioner, it\nsimultaneously makes the person sicker, plunging her into intensified\ninner conflict (GM III, 15, 20\u201321). Thus,\nNietzsche\u2019s fundamental objection to asceticism is that it is\npsychologically destructive and practically self-defeating, even for\nthose (the sick) for whom it does its best work\u2014and this is so\neven if it remains (from a certain perspective) the best they\ncan do for themselves in their condition.\n\nWhile this section has focused on the Genealogy, it is worth\nnoting that its three studies are offered only as examples of\nNietzschean skepticism about conventional moral ideas. In The\nAntichrist, Nietzsche extended these criticisms of the\nspecifically Christian psychological, cognitive, and evaluative\nfoundations for morality (an extension which has been the subject of\nextensive recent discussion; see, e.g., Snelson 2017; Berry 2019; and\nthe papers included in Conway 2019), and his other works criticize\nmany other moral ideas. \n\nTo highlight just one example, Nietzsche attacks the value of\ncompassion (another central element in Schopenhauer\u2019s moral\ntheory). Nietzsche tried out many different arguments against pity and\ncompassion beginning already in Human, All-too-human (1878)\nand continuing to the end of his productive life\u2014for discussion,\nsee Reginster (2000), Janaway (2017a, 2017b), and Nussbaum (1994). At\ntimes, he emphasized the ad hominem suggestion that\ncompassion is less altruistic than it seems, either based on the La\nRochefoucauld-inspired reasoning that apparently altruistic compassion\nis in reality just cloaked egoism (D 133), or based on the\npsychologically subtle point that the satisfactions of pity\nessentially involve a feeling of \u201csmall superiority\u201d over\nothers (GM III, 18)\u2014(note that Rousseau relies on a\nsimilar observation as part of his defense of pity\u2019s\nrole in moral development; Rousseau [1762] 1979: 221). But\nNietzsche\u2019s deeper complaints begin from the observation that a\nmorality of compassion centers attention on the problem of suffering,\npresupposing that suffering is bad as such. Nietzsche resists the\nhedonistic doctrine that pleasure and pain lie at the basis of all\nvalue claims, which would be the most natural way to defend such a\npresupposition. If he is right that there are other values,\nindependent of consequences for pleasures and pains, that fact raises\nthe possibility that the ultimate value of any particular incidence of\nsuffering could depend on the role it plays in the sufferer\u2019s\nlife overall and how it might contribute to those other\nvalues; in that case, its badness would not follow immediately from\nthe bare fact that it is suffering. Nietzsche builds this idea into an\nargument against the morality of compassion, suggesting that suffering\nmay sometimes promote a person\u2019s growth, or progress\ntoward excellence (GS 338; see also Janaway 2017a). From that\npoint of view, the morality of compassion looks both presumptuous and\nmisguided. It is presumptuous because it concludes from the outside\nthat a person\u2019s suffering must be bad, thereby flattening out\n\u201cwhat is most personal\u201d (GS 338) in the\nperson\u2019s life and interfering with her deciding for herself on\nthe value of her suffering. It is misguided both because it runs the\nrisk of robbing individuals of their opportunity to make something\npositive (individually meaningful) out of their suffering,\nand because the global devaluation of suffering as such dismisses in\nadvance the potentially valuable aspects of our general condition as\nvulnerable and finite creatures (GS 338; compare Williams\n1973: 82\u2013100).\n\nThis survey hits only a few highlights of Nietzsche\u2019s\nfar-reaching critique of traditional moral and religious values, which\nextends to many other moral ideas (e.g., sin, otherworldly\ntranscendence, the doctrine of free will, the value of selflessness,\nanti-sensualist moral outlooks, and more). For him, however, human\nbeings remain valuing creatures in the last analysis. It follows that\nno critique of traditional values could be practically effective\nwithout suggesting replacement values capable of meeting our\nneeds as valuers (see GS 347; Anderson 2009, esp. at\n225\u20137; Richardson 2020 attempts a systematization of the\nreplacement values). Nietzsche thought it was the job of philosophers\nto create such values (BGE 211), so readers have long and\nrightly expected to find an account of value creation in his\nworks.\n",
