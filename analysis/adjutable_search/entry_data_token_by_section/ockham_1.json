    "main_text": "Life || England (c. 1287-1324)\n1.1 England (c. 1287-1324)\n\nOckham was born, probably in late 1287 or early 1288, in the village\nof Ockham (=\u00a0Oak Hamlet) in Surrey, a little to the southwest of\n London.[2]\n He probably learned basic Latin at a village school in Ockham or\nnearby, but this is not\n certain.[3]\n At an early age, somewhere between seven and thirteen, Ockham was\n\u201cgiven\u201d to the Franciscan order (the so called\n \u201cGreyfriars\u201d).[4]\n There was no Franciscan house (called a \u201cconvent\u201d) in the\ntiny village of Ockham itself; the nearest one was in London, a\nday\u2019s ride to the northeast. It was there that Ockham was\nsent.\n\nAs an educational institution, even for higher education, London\nGreyfriars was a distinguished place; at the time, it was second only\nto the full-fledged Universities of Paris and Oxford. At Greyfriars,\nOckham probably got most of his \u201cgrade school\u201d education,\nand then went on to what we might think of as \u201chigh\nschool\u201d education in basic logic and \u201cscience\u201d\n(natural philosophy), beginning around the age of fourteen.\n\nAround 1310, when he was about 23, Ockham began his theological\ntraining. It is not certain where this training occurred. It could\nwell have been at the London Convent, or it could have been at Oxford,\nwhere there was another Franciscan convent associated with the\nuniversity. In any event, Ockham was at Oxford studying theology by at\nleast the year 1318\u201319, and probably the previous year as well,\nwhen (in 1317) he began a required two-year cycle of lectures\ncommenting on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, the standard\ntheological textbook of the day. Then, probably in 1321, Ockham\nreturned to London Greyfriars, where he remained. Although he had\ntaken the initial steps in the theology program at Oxford (hence his\noccasional nickname, the Venerabilis Inceptor,\n\u201cVenerable Beginner\u201d), Ockham did not complete the program\nthere, and never became a fully qualified \u201cmaster\u201d of\ntheology at Oxford. Nevertheless, London Greyfriars was an\nintellectually lively place, and Ockham was by no means isolated from\nthe heat of academic controversy. Among his \u201chousemates\u201d\nwere two other important Franciscan thinkers of the day, Walter\nChatton and Adam Wodeham, both sharp critics of Ockham\u2019s views.\nIt was in this context that Ockham wrote many of his most important\nphilosophical and theological works.\n\nIn 1323 Ockham was called before the Franciscan province\u2019s\nchapter meeting, held that year in Bristol, to defend his views, which\nwere regarded with suspicion by some of his confreres. About the same\ntime, someone\u2014it is not clear who\u2014went from England to the\nPapal court at Avignon and charged Ockham with teaching\n heresy.[5]\n As a result, a commission of theologians was set up to study the\ncase. Ockham was called to Avignon in May, 1324, to answer the\ncharges. He never went back to England.\n",
