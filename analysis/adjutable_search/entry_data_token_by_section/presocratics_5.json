    "main_text": "Other Eleatics: Zeno and Melissus\n6. Other Eleatics: Zeno and Melissus\n\nParmenides had argued that there were strict metaphysical requirements\non any object of knowledge; the later Eleatics (named for following\nParmenidean doctrines rather than for strictly geographical reasons),\nZeno of Elea (born ca. 490) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440),\nextended and explored the consequences of his arguments. Zeno paid\nparticular attention to the contrast between the requirements of\nlogical argument and the evidence of the senses (Vlastos 1967 is a\nmasterly treatment of Zeno; see also McKirahan 1999 and 2005). The\nfour famous paradoxes of motion, for which he is now and in antiquity\nbest known, purported to show that, despite the evidence all around\nus, the ordinary motion of everyday experience is impossible. The\nparadoxes claim that motions can never be begun (the Achilles) or be\ncompleted (the Dichotomy), entail contradictions (the Moving Blocks),\nor are altogether impossible (the\n Arrow).[6]\n Recent philosophers of space and time (see Gr\u00fcnbaum 1967,\narticles in Salmon 2001, Huggett 1999, and the entry on \n  Zeno\u2019s Paradoxes) hold that\n the arguments are reductios of the theses that\nspace and time are continuous (the Achilles and the Dichotomy) or\ndiscrete (the Moving Blocks and the Arrow). Consider the Dichotomy: a\nrunner can never complete a run from point A to point B. First, the\nrunner must move from A to a point halfway between A and B (call it\nC). But between A and C there is yet another halfway point (D), and\nthe runner must first reach D. But between A and D there is yet\nanother halfway point \u2026 and so on, ad infinitum. So the runner,\nstarting at A, can never reach B. The argument assumes that it is\nimpossible to pass an infinite number of points in a finite time.\nSimilarly, Zeno produced paradoxes showing that plurality is\nimpossible: if things are many, contradictions follow (Plato\u2019s\nParmenides 127e1ff.; Zeno in DK29B1/LM20D5, D6;\nDK29B2/LM20D7, R6; and DK29B3/LM20D11); there were also purported\nproofs that place is impossible (DK29A24/LM20D13a, R22, R23) and that\nthings cannot have parts (the Millet Seed, DK29A29/LM20D12a, D12b,\nR16).\n\nMelissus, dismissed as a simple-minded thinker by Aristotle (and by\nsome contemporary scholars as well but see Makin 2005), expands\nParmenides\u2019 arguments about the nature of what-is (Palmer 2004).\nIt is Melissus who explicitly claims that only one thing can be: if\nwhat-is is unlimited (as he thinks it is), it must be one and all\nalike (if there were two [in number or in character] they would be\n\u201climited against each other\u201d DK30B6/LM21D6). Melissus\nspecifically argues against the empty (the void), and rejects the\npossibility of rearrangement (which would allow for the appearance of\ncoming-to-be and passing-away, and of movement)\u2014all these\ncharacteristics are incompatible with the unity of what-is (i.e., the\nOne). Melissus thus claims that what is real is completely unlike the\nworld that we experience: the split between appearance and reality is\ncomplete and unbridgeable.\n",
