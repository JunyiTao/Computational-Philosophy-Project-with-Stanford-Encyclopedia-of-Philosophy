    "main_text": "\n\nA heritable trait is most simply an offspring\u2019s trait that\nresembles the parents\u2019 corresponding trait more than it\nresembles the same trait in a random individual in the\npopulation. Inheritance or heredity was a focus of systematic research\nbefore its inclusion as a key concept within evolutionary theory. An\ninfluential 18th and early 19th century theory\nof heredity was preformationism. This view took several forms, each\nmaintaining that organisms were passed on from one generation to the\nnext, miniature and yet fully formed, and development was simply the\ngrowth of the miniature organism. Subsequent accounts of heredity\nincluded the theory that organisms inherited traits that their parents\nhad developed through response to various environmental\npressures. This view was widely held during the 19th\ncentury and usually attributed to Lamarck. Although Darwin also at\ntimes defended aspects of Lamarck\u2019s view, he also clearly\narticulates and defends the view that evolutionary change results from\nnatural selection acting upon inherited traits under\nvariation. Weismann\u2019s experimental refutation of the inheritance\nof acquired traits paved the way for the combination of Darwin and\nMendel\u2019s views of the nature of heredity. The systematic study\nof heredity in the 20th century focused on the gene as the\nunit of heredity. (There is a vast amount of helpful work on the\nhistory of heredity including Keller (2002), Griesemer (1994), Morange\n(1998), Moss (2003), Sapp (2003), Sarkar (1998), Wade (1992), Winther\n(2000; 2001) and contributors to Buerton et al. (eds.) (2000).) Two\ntraditions now dominate the study of heredity: population genetics and\nmolecular biology. The notion of a quantitative measure of the\nheritability of any given trait comes from population genetics and\nheritability measures are commonly used in behavioral genetics (Plomin\net al. 1990 and Plomin et al. 1997 and see Panofsky 2014, Tabery 2014\nand Taylor 2014 for critical reflection on behavioral genetics and\nheritability analysis). The idea that what is inherited is a stock of\nDNA, or the information contained in the DNA sequence, comes from\nmolecular biology.\n\nPhilosophical discussions of heredity have predominantly focused on\nthe sustainability of heritability analyses. Here we introduce the\nconcept of heritability, alternate approaches to determining the\nheritability of traits and the philosophical problems associated with\nthese alternate approaches.\n",
