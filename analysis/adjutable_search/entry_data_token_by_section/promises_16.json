    "main_text": "Issues in Promissory Theory || Problematic Promisees and the Uptake Condition\n5.1 Problematic Promisees and the Uptake Condition\n\nOne source of discussion are the issues surrounding promisees that are\nsomehow different from the paradigm promisee. The paradigm promisee is\naware of the promise, acknowledges and confirms the promissory\narrangement, welcomes or at least doesn\u2019t spurn the promised act\nand expects and/or relies on its execution or the subsequent state of\naffairs. In the literature these are called \u201cuptake\u201d\nconditions (the term was coined by Thomson [1990: 301]).\n\nMost promissory theories employ some sort of uptake condition, for\ndifferent reason (see Liberto 2018) with expectational theories\ngenerally having the more demanding ones. But not all plausible\npromisees can satisfy these conditions. These are problematic\npromisees, cases where a promise to them seems intuitively valid, but\nthe promisee fails to satisfy the uptake condition.\n\nA paradigm example of such problematic cases are promises to the dead\nor dying, since those promisees can\u2019t be disappointed or harmed.\nThat is, unless one subscribes to the view that the dead can be\nharmed, and whether or not this is even possible is a question that\nthinkers have also spent some time on (see Boonin 2019, for a survey\nof the philosophical literature here). Like promises to the self,\npromises to the dead are a commonplace in both prose and poetry take\nJane Austen\u2019s\u00a0Pride and Prejudice, or J\nStafford\u2019s\u00a0The Cremation of Sam McGee\n\nOne such sort of case that arose in the mid-twentieth century is the\nso-called \u201cDesert Island\u201d case, where a promise is made in\nisolation (on a desert island) to someone who then dies. The case was\nwielded against act utilitarians, as an example of a sort of case that\nthe expectationalist sort of views they espouse can\u2019t answer\n(see Nowell-Smith 1956; Narveson 1963: 210; Cargile 1964; Narveson\n1967: 196\u20137).\n\nBut recently scholars have widened the criticism. Nick Leonard\n(forthcoming) argues that, like the dead and dying, promisees who fail\nto have the standard cognitive capacity to rely on promises would\ncertainly fail the uptake condition for expectational theories. He\nimagines in this role small children, or people with severe cognitive\nlimitations. Such promisees are intuitively owed fidelity, but\nexpectational promissory theories can\u2019t accommodate this\njudgment, since the promisees don\u2019t have the required uptake,\ni.e., they fail to form expectations or reliance. Further Leonard\nargues that joint commitment views are similarly cognitively\ndemanding, requiring as they do complex and sophisticated mental\nstates like mutual intentions.\n\nSimilarly James S. Taylor (2021) argues that authority views like\nOwens\u2019, that appeal to the possible exercise of power over the\npromisor by the promisee, can\u2019t accommodate dead or absent\npromisees. And Hallie Liberto (2018) through a set of subtle and\nclever cases, argues that uptake conditions in both authority and\njoint commitment views might be violated even by perfectly\nparadigmatic promisees. The cases involve promisees that are either\ndelayed, absent or not yet specified at the time of the creation of\nthe promissory obligation. Liberto argues that uptake has what she\ncall a \u201cbackward reach\u201d, meaning that it must be able to\nbe satisfied after the promissory obligation has\nattached.\n\nAlbrecht (2018), argues that these sorts of promises to the dead or\nmissing, to young children, to oneself, give rise to\n\u201casymmetrical\u201d promises. On what Albrecht calls\n\u201ctransactional\u201d sorts of promissory theories a promise is\nan exchange of rights (or authority, or whatever the specific\nmechanism is) which transaction occurs between independent agents. But\nin certain cases, where the promisee is unable to fulfil their pat of\nthe transaction, the promisor can stand in for her as a proxy. But\nthis only occurs, says Albrecht, in cases where the promisor is in\nsome way already responsible for the promisee. So, when we promise our\nyoung children t, say, get them a good education, we act to accept the\npromise on their part, as a proxy for them, in our role as parent, in\nthe same way we might receive money or other things on their\nbehalf.\n\nIn another vein, A. S. Roth (2016) argues that the uptake condition\nmust be understood as the promisee intending that the\npromisor perform, as opposed to \u201cexpecting\u201d or\n\u201ctrusting\u201d such. This construal allows him to respond to\nthe circularity worry inherent in expectational views. (see the\nsection covering\n expectationalism [\u00a73.3]).\n\nFollowing Scanlon, Roth analyses the circularity worry in epistemic\nterms, as a lack of justification for the belief in performance on the\npart of the promisee. But, argues Roth, intentional beliefs, of the\nsort we form when we form an intention to do some act don\u2019t\ntypically require epistemic justification. If I intend to take a walk,\nI come to believe that I will, and that belief is reasonable (ceteris\nparibus) without any other evidence that I will do so.\n\nSo (argues Roth) if we construe the promisee as intending that the\npromisor perform the promised act, and if we take intentions\nas cognitive, i.e., as partly constituted by beliefs, then we can\navoid the need for justification, and thus the circularity, since\nbeliefs of this sort don\u2019t typically require justification:\n\n\nBy offering a sufficiently attractive invitation (which most promises\nare), the promisor leads the promisee to accept. And the promisee\naccepts by intending the promisor\u2019s action. So we have a case of\nthe promisor leading the promisee to a belief (as required by\nPrinciple F), but not in a way that requires evidence. For, if\nCognitivism is true, the expectation that comes with the intention to\n\u03d5 is normally not based on evidence. [\u2026] Notice, also,\nthat the process described is entirely compatible with the expectation\n(hence acceptance) being voluntary. An attractive invitation was made\nand voluntarily accepted: the promisee voluntarily intends the\npromisor\u2019s action, and given Cognitivism, thereby forms the\nexpectation. (Roth 2016: 111)\n\n\nThis turn has also sparked some recent discussion, see Sharadin\n(2018), Shaver (2019), Dannenberg (2019), Kenessey (2020) and Lichter\n(2021)\n",
