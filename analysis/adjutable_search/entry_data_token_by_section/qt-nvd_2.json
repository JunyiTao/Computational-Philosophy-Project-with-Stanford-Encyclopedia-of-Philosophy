    "main_text": "Von Neumann and the Foundations of Quantum Theory || The Separable Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n2.1 The Separable Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n\nMatrix mechanics and wave mechanics were formulated roughly around the\nsame time between 1925 and 1926. In July 1925, Heisenberg finished his\nseminal paper \u201cOn a Quantum Theoretical Interpretation of\nKinematical and Mechanical Relations\u201d. Two months later, Born\nand Jordan finished their paper, \u201cOn Quantum Mechanics\u201d,\nwhich is the first rigorous formulation of matrix mechanics. Two\nmonths after this, Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan finished \u201cOn\nQuantum Mechanics II\u201d, which is an elaboration of the earlier\nBorn and Jordan paper; it was published in early 1926. These three\npapers are reprinted in van der Waerden (1967). Meanwhile,\nSchr\u00f6dinger was working on what eventually became his four famous\npapers on wave mechanics. The first was received by Annalen der\nPhysik in January 1926, the second was received in February, and\nthen the third in May and the fourth in June. All four are reprinted\nin Schr\u00f6dinger (1928).\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger was the first to raise the question of the\nrelationship between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics in\nSchr\u00f6dinger (1926), which was published in Annalen in\nspring 1926 between the publication of his second and third papers of\nthe famous four. This paper is also reprinted in Schr\u00f6dinger\n(1928). It contains the germ of a mathematical equivalence proof, but\nit does not contain a rigorous proof of equivalency: the mathematical\nframework that Schr\u00f6dinger associated with wave mechanics is a\nspace of continuous and normalizable functions, which is too small to\nestablish the appropriate relation with matrix mechanics. Shortly\nthereafter, Dirac and Jordan independently provided a unification of\nthe two frameworks. But their respective approaches required essential\nuse of \\(\\delta\\) functions, which were suspect from the standpoint of\nmathematical rigor. In 1927, von Neumann published three papers in\nG\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten that placed quantum mechanics on a\nrigorous mathematical foundation and included a rigorous proof (i.e.,\nwithout the use of \\(\\delta\\) functions) of the equivalence of matrix\nand wave mechanics. These papers are reprinted in von\nNeumann(1961\u20131963, Volume I, Numbers 8\u201310). In the preface\nto his famous 1932 treatise on quantum mechanics (von Neumann 1955),\nwhich is an elegant summary of the separable Hilbert space formulation\nof quantum mechanics that he provided in the earlier papers, he\nacknowledges the simplicity and utility of Dirac\u2019s formulation\nof quantum mechanics, but finds it ultimately unacceptable. He\nindicates that he cannot endure the use of what could then only be\nregarded as mathematical fictions. Examples of these fictions include\nDirac\u2019s assumption that every self-adjoint operator can be put\nin diagonal form and his use of \\(\\delta\\) functions, which von\nNeumann characterizes as \u201cimproper functions with\nself-contradictory properties\u201d. His stated purpose is to\nformulate a framework for quantum mechanics that is mathematically\nrigorous.\n\nWhat follows is a brief sketch of von Neumann\u2019s strategy. First,\nhe recognized the mathematical framework of matrix mechanics as what\nwould now be characterized as an infinite dimensional, separable\nHilbert space. Here the term\u00a0\u201cHilbert space\u201d denotes\na complete vector space with an inner product; von Neumann imposed the\nadditional requirement of separability (having a countable basis) in\nhis definition of a Hilbert space. He then attempted to specify a set\nof functions that would instantiate an (infinite-dimensional)\nseparable Hilbert space and could be identified with\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave mechanics. He began with the space of\nsquare-integrable functions on the real line. To satisfy the\ncompleteness condition, that all Cauchy sequences of functions\nconverge (in the mean) to some function in that space, he specified\nthat integration must be defined in the manner of Lebesgue. To define\nan inner product operation, he specified that the set of Lebesgue\nsquare-integrable functions must be partitioned into equivalence\nclasses modulo the relation of differing on a set of measure zero.\nThat the elements of the space are equivalence classes of functions\nrather than functions is sometimes overlooked, and it has interesting\nramifications for interpretive investigations. It has been argued in\nKronz (1999), for example, that separable Hilbert space is not a\nsuitable framework for quantum mechanics under Bohm\u2019s\nontological interpretation (also known as\n Bohmian mechanics).\n",
