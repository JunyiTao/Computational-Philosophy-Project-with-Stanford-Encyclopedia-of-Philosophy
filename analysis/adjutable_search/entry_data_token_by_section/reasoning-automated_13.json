As a rule, automated theorem\nprovers lack such rich knowledge and attempt to construct proofs from\nfirst principles by the application of elementary deduction rules.\nThis approach results in very lengthy proofs (assuming a proof is\nfound) with each step being justified at a most basic logical level.\nLarger inference steps and a significant improvement in mathematical\nreasoning capability can be obtained, however, by having a theorem\nprover interact with a computer algebra system, also known as a\nsymbolic computation system. A computer algebra\nsystem is a computer program that assists the user with the\nsymbolic manipulation and numeric evaluation of mathematical\nexpressions. For example, when asked to compute the improper\nintegral\n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u221e\n\n\u222b\n\n0 \ne\u2212a2t2cos2bt\ndt \n\n\n\na competent computer algebra system would quickly reply with the\nanswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u221a\u03c0\n\n\n2a \n \ne\u2212b2/a2\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, the computer algebra system operates by taking the input\nexpression entered by the user and successively applies to it a series\nof transformation rules until the result no longer changes (see the\nsection Term Rewriting in this article for more details).\nThese transformation rules encode a significant amount of domain\n(mathematical) knowledge making symbolic systems powerful tools in the\nhands of applied mathematicians, scientists, and engineers trying to\nattack problems in a wide variety of fields ranging from calculus and\nthe solving of equations to combinatorics and number theory.\n\nProblem solving in mathematics involves the interplay of deduction and\ncalculation, with decision procedures being a reminder of the fuzzy\ndivision between the two; hence, the integration of deductive and\nsymbolic systems, which we coin here as Deductive Computer\nAlgebra (DCA), is bound to be a fruitful combination.\nAnalytica (Bauer, Clarke & Zhao 1998) is a theorem prover built on\ntop of Mathematica, a powerful and popular computer algebra system.\nBesides supplying the deductive engine, Analytica also extends\nMathematica\u2019s capabilities by defining a number of rewrite\nrules\u2014more precisely, identities about summations and\ninequalities\u2014that are missing in the system, as well as\nproviding an implementation of Gosper\u2019s algorithm for finding closed\nforms of indefinite hypergeometric summations. Equipped with this\nextended knowledge, Analytica can prove semi-automatically some\nnontrivial theorems from real analysis, including a series of lemmas\ndirectly leading to a proof of the Bernstein Approximation Theorem.\nHere is the statement of the theorem simply to give the reader a sense\nof the level of the mathematical richness we are dealing with:\n\nBernstein Approximation Theorem.\n\nLet I = [0, 1] be the closed unit interval, f a real\ncontinuous function on I, and\nBn(x,f) the\nnth Bernstein polynomial for f defined as\n\n\n\nBn(x, f)\n = \n n\n\n\u2211\n\nk=0 \n(\nn\n\nk\n)\nf(k/n)xk(1\n\u2212 x)n\u2212k \n Then, on the interval I, the sequence of Bernstein\npolynomials for f converges uniformly to f.\n\n\nTo be frank, the program is supplied with key information to establish\nthe lemmas that lead to this theorem but the amount and type of\ndeductive work done by the program is certainly nontrivial. (Clarke\n& Zhao 1994) provides examples of fully automated proofs using\nproblems in Chapter 2 of Ramanujan\u2019s Notebooks (Berndt 1985)\nincluding the following example that the reader is invited to try.\nShow that:\n\n\n\n Ar\n\n\u2211\n\nk=n+1 \n\n\n\n1\n\n\nk \n \n = \nr + 2\n(\n r\n\n\u2211\n\nk=1 \n(r \u2212 k)\n(\n Ak\n\n\u2211\n\nj=Ak\u22121+1\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n(3j)3\u22123j\n\n \n)\n)\n + 2r\u03c6(3,A0) \n\n\n\nwhere A0=1,\nAn+1=3An+1 and\n\u03c6(x,n) is Ramanujan\u2019s abbreviation for\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6(x,n)\n =df \n n\n\n\u2211\n\nk=1 \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2212(kx)+k3x3\n\n  \n\n\n\nAnalytica\u2019s proof of this identity proceeds by simplifying both the\nleft- and right-hand sides of the equality and showing that both sides\nreduce to the same expression, \u2212Hn +\nHAr. The simplification uses the added summation\nidentities mentioned before as well as some elementary properties of\nthe harmonic numbers,\n\n\n\nHn\n = \n n\n\n\u2211\n\nk=1 \n\n\n\n1\n\n\nk \n  \n\n\n\nThe resulting proof has 28 steps (some of which are nontrivial) taking\nabout 2 minutes to find.\n\nKerber, Kohlhase & Sorge 1998 use the \u03a9mega planning\nsystem as the overall way to integrate theorem proving and symbolic\ncomputation. In Harrison & Th\u00e9ry 1998, we find an example\nof the integration of a higher-order logic theorem proving system\n(HOL) with a computer algebra system (Maple).\n\nTheir great power notwithstanding, symbolic algebra systems do not\nenforce the same level of rigor and formality that is the essence of\nautomated deduction systems. In fact, the mathematical semantics of\nsome of the knowledge rules in most algebra systems is not entirely\nclear and are, in cases, logically unsound (Harrison & Th\u00e9ry\n1998). The main reason for this is an over-aggressiveness to provide\nthe user with an answer in a timely fashion at whatever cost,\nbypassing the checking of required assumptions even if it means\nsacrificing the soundness of the calculation. (This is strongly\nreminiscent of most Prolog implementations that bypass the so-called\n\u201coccurs-check\u201d also abandoning logical soundness in the\nname of efficiency.) This serious problem opens the opportunity for a\ndeduction system to provide a service to the computer algebra system:\nUse its deductive capabilities to verify that the computer algebra\u2019s\ncomputational steps meet the required assumptions. There is a catch in\nthis, however: For sufficiently large calculation steps, verifying is\ntantamount to proving and, to check these steps, the deduction system\nmay well need the assistance of the very same system that is in need\nof verification! The solution to the soundness problem may then well\nrequire an extensive modification of the chosen symbolic algebra\nsystem to make it sound; an alternative approach is to develop a new\nsystem, entirely from scratch, in conjunction with the development of\nthe automated theorem prover. In either case, the resulting combined\ndeductive computer algebra system should display a much improved\nability for automated mathematical reasoning.\n",
