    "main_text": "Theories of Mind || Repository Consciousness\n5.5 Repository Consciousness\n\n\nThe theoretical developments that led to the notion of repository \nconsciousness (\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na), which is \nassociated with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra School, are already \nforeshadowed in these Abhidharma debates about how best to \naccount for continuity in the mental stream and the efficacy of \naccumulated karmic potential. The notion of repository consciousness \nappears perhaps for the first time in Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s \nencyclopedic work, Stages of the Practice of Yoga \n(Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi, cf. Schmithausen 1987, 12, \n18). The new type of consciousness, closely connected with the living\nbody, retains much of the original use of vij\u00f1\u0101na \nto designate both consciousness and cognition. The function of the \nrepository consciousness is explained in a seminal Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nwork such as the Sutra Explaining the Profound Meaning \n(Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra, V. 2, Lamotte 1935, 230) \nas having the primary function of \u2018descending\u2019 in the \nmother's womb, \u2018appropriating\u2019 the sensory systems and \ntheir respective cognitive support, and thus creating the \npredisposition toward mental proliferation (cf. Waldron 2003, 95 and \npassim).\n\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thus explains the cognitive process as a \nmaturation of the flow of discrete elements of consciousness. This \nflow of consciousness, which the Sautr\u0101ntikas call \nmind-continuum (citta-sant\u0101na), ultimately supports all\ntypes of perceptual activity, including self-awareness. In its \nindeterminate state, this flow of consciousness is the repository of \nall non-aspectual types of cognitive awareness \n(nirvikalpa-j\u00f1\u0101na). This repository mind is said \nto arise together with all the seeds, thus suggesting the imagery of \na repository of all the elements of consciousness and cognition. \n\n\nIn the Compendium of the Great Vehicule \n(Mah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43graha; hereafter MSG), Asanga \ndefines the receptacle consciousness \n(\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na) as the basis or support of \nthat which is cognizable (j\u00f1ey\u0101\u015braya) and \nexplains the term \u2018receptacle\u2019 (\u0101laya) as \nsuggestive of a double function: (1) that of acting as a repository \nfor the afflictive tendencies, and (2) that of providing the causal \npotentiality of the dharmas themselves (MSG I, 1\u20135). \nFurthermore, the receptacle consciousness is described as having the \nuncommon characteristic of being the seed for the sense spheres (MSG \nI, 59): the obvious implication here is that our experience of the \nworld is as perception reveals it. And since the sense spheres are in\neffect seeded by this receptacle consciousness, the world we inhabit \nis ultimately a minded world.\n\n\nIn his analysis of consciousness in the Thirty Verses \n(Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101-k\u0101rik\u0101, I, 1) Vasubandhu\ntreats apprehending subject and apprehended phenomena are emergent \nproperties of the threefold transformation of consciousness \n(vij\u00f1\u0101napari\u1e47ama). This transformation \nbegins when the maturating seeds of consciousness take the form of \nperception and thought processes. Following this process of \nmaturation and in dependence upon the repository consciousness there \nevolves a reflexive awareness whose object is none other than this \nsubliminal or repository consciousness itself. This theory of \ncognitive emergence presumably provides a better account of the role \nthat the residual forces of past cognitions play in \n\u2018seeding\u2018 the repository consciousness. It is the \ndynamics of these residual forces which ultimately generates the \nintentional forms of cognitive awareness that support all other forms\nof cognitive activity. \n",
