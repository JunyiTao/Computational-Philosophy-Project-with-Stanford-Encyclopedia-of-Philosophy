    "main_text": "Modernity || Reenchantment via Disenchantment\n4.2 Reenchantment via Disenchantment\n\nIn point of fact, Weber\u2019s rationalization thesis can be\nunderstood with richer nuance when we approach it as, for lack of\nbetter terms, a dialectics of disenchantment and reenchantment rather\nthan as a one-sided, unilinear process of secularization.\nDisenchantment had ushered in monotheistic religions in the West. In\npractice, this means that ad hoc maxims for life-conduct had\nbeen gradually displaced by a unified total system of meaning and\nvalue, which historically culminated in the Puritan ethic of vocation.\nHere, the irony was that disenchantment was an ongoing process\nnonetheless. Disenchantment in its second phase pushed aside\nmonotheistic religion as something irrational, thus delegitimating it\nas a unifying worldview in the modern secular world.\n\nModern science, which was singularly responsible for this late\ndevelopment, was initially welcomed as a surrogate system of orderly\nvalue-creation, as Weber found in the convictions of Bacon (science as\n\u201cthe road to true nature\u201d) and Descartes (as\n\u201cthe road to the true god\u201d) [Weber 1919/1946,\n142]. For Weber, nevertheless, modern science is a deeply nihilistic\nenterprise in which any scientific achievement worthy of the name\nmust \u201cask to be surpassed and made obsolete\u201d in a\nprocess \u201cthat is in principle ad infinitum,\u201d at\nwhich point, \u201cwe come to the problem of the meaning of\nscience.\u201d He went on to ask: \u201cFor it is simply not\nself-evident that something which is subject to such a law is in\nitself meaningful and rational. Why should one do something which in\nreality never comes to an end and never can?\u201d [Ibid.,\n138: translation altered]. In short, modern science has relentlessly\ndismantled all other sources of value-creation, in the course of which\nits own meaning has also been dissipated beyond repair. The result is\nthe \u201cG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung of all evaluative\nperspectives\u201d including its own [Weber 1904/1949, 86].\n\nIrretrievably gone as a result is a unifying worldview, be it\nreligious or scientific, and what ensues is its fragmentation into\nincompatible value spheres. Weber, for instance, observed:\n\u201csince Nietzsche, we realize that something can be beautiful,\nnot only in spite of the aspect in which it is not good, but rather in\nthat very aspect\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 148]. That is to say,\naesthetic values now stand in irreconcilable antagonism to religious\nvalues, transforming \u201cvalue judgments (Werturteile)\ninto judgments of taste (Geschmacksurteile) by which what is\nmorally reprehensible becomes merely what is tasteless\u201d [Weber\n1915/1946, 342].\n\nWeber is, then, not envisioning a peaceful dissolution of the\ngrand metanarratives of monotheistic religion and universal science\ninto a series of local narratives and the consequent modern pluralist\nculture in which different cultural practices follow their own\nimmanent logic. His vision of polytheistic reenchantment is rather\nthat of an incommensurable value-fragmentation into a plurality of\nalternative metanarratives, each of which claims to answer the same\nmetaphysical questions that religion and science strove to cope with\nin their own ways. The slow death of God has reached its apogee in the\nreturn of gods and demons who \u201cstrive to gain power over our\nlives and again \u2026 resume their eternal struggle with one\nanother\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 149].\n\nSeen this way, it makes sense that Weber\u2019s rationalization\nthesis concludes with two strikingly dissimilar prophecies \u2013 one\nis the imminent iron cage of bureaucratic petrification and the other,\nthe Hellenistic pluralism of warring deities. The modern world has\ncome to be monotheistic and polytheistic all at once. What seems to\nunderlie this seemingly self-contradictory imagery of modernity is the\nproblem of modern humanity (Menschentum) and its loss of\nfreedom and moral agency. Disenchantment has created a world with no\nobjectively ascertainable ground for one\u2019s conviction. Under the\ncircumstances, according to Weber, a modern individual tends to act\nonly on one\u2019s own aesthetic impulse and arbitrary convictions\nthat cannot be communicated in the eventuality; the majority of those\nwho cannot even act on their convictions, or the \u201clast men who\ninvented happiness\u201d \u00e0 la Nietzsche, lead the life of a\n\u201ccog in a machine.\u201d Whether the problem of modernity is\naccounted for in terms of a permeation of objective, instrumental\nrationality or of a purposeless agitation of subjective values, Weber\nviewed these two images as constituting a single problem insofar as\nthey contributed to the inertia of modern individuals who fail to take\nprincipled moral action. The \u201csensualists without heart\u201d\nand \u201cspecialists without spirit\u201d indeed formed two faces\nof the same coin that may be called the disempowerment of the\nmodern self.\n",
