    "main_text": "Is Circularity a Problem?\n6. Is Circularity a Problem?\n\nSuppose that we agree that any plausible version of a manipulability\ntheory must make use of the notion of an intervention and that this\nmust be characterized in causal terms. Does this sort of\n\u201ccircularity\u201d make any such theory trivial and\nunilluminating? It is arguable that it does not, for at least two\nreasons. First, it may be, as writers like Woodward (2003) contend,\nthat in characterizing what it is for a process \\(I\\) to qualify as an\nintervention on \\(X\\) for the purposes of characterizing what it is\nfor \\(X\\) to cause \\(Y\\), we need not make use of information about\nthe causal relationship, if any, between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Instead, it\nmay be that we need only to make use of other sorts of causal\ninformation, e.g., about the causal relationship between \\(I\\) and\n\\(Y\\) or about whether \\(I\\) is caused by causes that cause \\(Y\\)\nwithout causing \\(X\\), as in\n (M1)\u2013(M4)\n above. To the extent that this is so, we may use one set of claims\nabout causal relationships (e.g., that \\(X\\) has been changed in a way\nthat meets the conditions for an intervention) together with\ncorrelational information (that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) remain correlated\nunder this change) to characterize what it is for a different\nrelationship (the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y)\\) to be causal.\nThis does not yield a reduction of causal talk to non-causal talk, but\nit is also not viciously circular in the sense that it presupposes\nthat we already have causal information about the very relationship\nthat we are trying to characterize. One reason for thinking that there\nmust be some way of characterizing the notion of an\nintervention along the lines just described is that we do sometimes\nlearn about causal relationships by performing experiments\u2014and\nit is not easy to see how this is possible if to characterize the\nnotion of an intervention on \\(X\\) we had to make reference to the\ncausal relationship between \\(X\\) and its effects.\n\nA related point is that even if manipulability accounts of causation\nare non-reductive, they can conflict with other accounts of\ncausation, leading to different causal judgments in particular cases.\nAs an illustration consider a simple version of manipulability account\nalong the lines of\n (CD),\n according to which a sufficient condition for \\(X\\) to cause (have a\ncausal effect on \\(Y)\\) is that some change in the value of \\(X\\)\nproduced by an intervention is associated with a change in the value\nof \\(Y\\) (in the background circumstances of interest). Such an\naccount implies that omissions (e.g., the failure of a gardener to\nwater a plant) can be causes (e.g., of the plant\u2019s death) since\na change under an intervention in whether the gardener waters is\nassociated with a change in the value of the variable measuring\nwhether the plant dies. For a similar reason relationships involving\n\u201cdouble prevention\u201d (Hall 2000) or \u201ccausation by\ndisconnection\u201d (Schaffer 2000) count as genuine causal\nrelationships on interventionist accounts. Consider, by contrast, the\nverdicts about these cases reached by a simple version of a causal\nprocess theory (in the sense of Salmon 1984, Dowe 2000) according\nto which a necessary condition for a particular instantiation \\(x\\) of\na value \\(X\\) to cause a particular instantiation \\(y\\) of a value\n\\(Y\\) is that there be a spatio-temporally continuous process\nconnecting \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) involving the transfer of energy, momentum\nor perhaps some other conserved quantity. According to such a theory,\n\u201ccausation\u201d by omission or by double prevention does not\nqualify as genuine causation. Similarly, if an \u201caction at a\ndistance\u201d version of Newtonian gravitational theory had turned\nout to be correct, this would be a theory that described genuine\ncausal relationships according to interventionist accounts of\ncausation, but not according to causal process accounts. Whether one\nregards the verdicts about these cases reached by causal process\naccounts or by interventionist accounts as more defensible, the very\nfact that the accounts lead to inconsistent judgments shows that\ninterventionist approaches are not trivial or vacuous, despite their\n\u201ccircular\u201d, non-reductive character.\n",
