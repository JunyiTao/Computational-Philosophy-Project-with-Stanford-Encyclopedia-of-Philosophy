    "main_text": "Actualism\n3. Actualism\n\n\nWhen it comes to cases concerning agents who are disposed to act\nwrongly, actualists consider their possibilist counterparts to be\noverly idealistic by theorizing about our moral obligations without\nconsidering the moral imperfections that result in our failing to do\nthe best that we can. According to actualists, the specific way in\nwhich our imperfections need to be considered is by taking into\naccount the truth-value of certain counterfactuals of freedom, i.e.,\ncertain facts about what we would freely do if we were in some\ncircumstances. The only counterfactuals that are relevant to our\nobjective obligations are ones in which the circumstances in the\nantecedent are fully described (Jackson 1985: 178, 186; Jackson &\nPargetter 1986: 240). This is because strengthening the antecedent of\na counterfactual, i.e., adding information to the antecedent, can\nalter the counterfactual\u2019s truth-value (Stalnaker 1968; Lewis\n1973).\n\n\nMost, if not all participants, in the actualist-possibilist debate\nseem to assume that the agents have the ability at one time to perform\nan act that they would not in fact perform at a later time if they\nwere in the relevant circumstances. For example, although Professor\nProcrastinate can \u27e8agree to review the paper & write the\nreview\u27e9, she would, as a matter of fact, \u27e8not write the\nreview\u27e9 if she were to \u27e8agree to review the\npaper\u27e9. In other words, she would do something (not write)\nother than what she can do (write). By holding fixed the fact that\nProcrastinate would \u27e8not write the review\u27e9 even if she\nwere to \u27e8agree to review the paper\u27e9, it follows from\nactualism that Procrastinate ought to \u27e8decline to review the\npaper\u27e9, even though she can \u27e8agree to review the paper\n& write the review\u27e9. This is because actualism roughly\nstates that an agent ought to \\(\\phi\\) just in case \\(\\phi\\)-ing would\nresult in a better outcome than any other alternative to \\(\\phi\\)-ing.\nRecall the generic definition offered in the previous section.\n\n Actualism: At t an agent S is\nobligated to \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\) iff S can \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\)\nand what would happen if S were to \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\) is better\nthan what would happen if S were to perform any alternative act\nat \\(t'\\).\n\n\n\nNow, what would happen if Procrastinate were to \u27e8decline to\nreview the paper\u27e9 is better than what would happen if\nProcrastinate were to \u27e8agree to review the paper\u27e9. As\nthis example illustrates, the value that actualists assign to an\noption is determined by what would happen if that option were\nperformed, rather than by being a member of the best act-set that the\nagent can perform over time. \u27e8Agreeing to review the\npaper\u27e9 is part of the best act-set that is presently available\nto Procrastinate. But the value of \u27e8agreeing to review the\npaper\u27e9 is less than the value of \u27e8declining to review\nthe paper\u27e9 because of what would happen if these respective\noptions were to be performed. \n\n\nBeyond this minimal agreement among all versions of actualism that\nProfessor Procrastinate ought (given certain descriptions of the case)\nto \u27e8decline to review the paper\u27e9, actualists diverge on\nother substantial issues concerning the scope of our obligations.\nHolly S. Goldman and Jordan Howard Sobel independently developed and\narticulated the first versions of actualism. We will begin by\nintroducing Goldman\u2019s formulation which is motivated in part by\nthe need to avoid prescribing jointly unfulfillable obligations.\n",
