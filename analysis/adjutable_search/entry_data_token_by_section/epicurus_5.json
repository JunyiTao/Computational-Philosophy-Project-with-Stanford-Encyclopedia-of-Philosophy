    "main_text": "Social Theory\n6. The Epicurean Life\n\nEpicurus placed an extremely high value on friendship (or love:\nphilia). A saying with rather a more poetic flair than is\nEpicurus\u2019 custom runs: \u201cFriendship goes dancing round the\nworld, announcing to all of us to wake up to happiness\u201d\n(Vatican Saying = VS 52). Epicurus held that a wise\nman would feel the torture of a friend no less than his own, and would\ndie for a friend rather than betray him, for otherwise his own life\nwould be confounded (VS 56\u201357). These are powerfully\naltruistic sentiments for a philosopher who posits as the unique goal\nin life happiness based on freedom from physical pain and mental\nanxiety. Epicurus could justify such an attitude by the same\nprudential calculus that he uses to argue in favor of living justly:\nonly by living in such a way that loyalty to friends is perceived to\nbe a consummate value will one be able to feel secure in one\u2019s\nfriends, and thus maximize one\u2019s felicity. Yet this does not\nseem quite what Epicurus means when he says that \u201cfriendship [or\nlove] had its beginning as a result of utility, but is to be chosen\n[or is a virtue, if we follow the manuscript reading] for its own\nsake\u201d (VS 23). The question is further complicated by\nthe report in Cicero\u2019s On Moral Ends (1.66\u201370)\nthat there was a difference of opinion concerning friendship among\nlater Epicureans. Since human beings were originally asocial and only\nlater learned to form alliances and compacts, it is possible that\nEpicurus means to say that this capacity for friendship arose out of\nneed, but that once the capacity for such feelings was acquired,\nfeeling them came to be valued in itself. The argument would be\nsimilar to the modern idea that altruism could have developed as a\nresult of natural selection. But the evidence does not permit a firm\nconclusion on this matter.\n\nWhen Epicurus spoke of friendship, he may have had at least partly in\nmind specifically the relationship among his followers, who seem to\nhave thought of themselves as friends. Epicureans were encouraged to\nform communities and to observe certain rituals, although most of\nthese practices, such as the celebration each month of the day (the\n20th) on which Epicurus was born or wearing rings bearing\nan image of Epicurus, may have originated after the founder\u2019s\ndeath. The Epicureans paid attention to problems of pedagogy as well,\nlaying out the best way to correct the ideas of people new to the\nschool and its community without cajoling or discouraging them. It\nmust be remembered that Epicurus understood the task of philosophy\nfirst and foremost as a form of therapy for life, since philosophy\nthat does not heal the soul is no better than medicine that cannot\ncure the body (Usener 1887, frag. 221). A life free of mental anxiety\nand open to the enjoyment of other pleasures was deemed equal to that\nof the gods. Indeed, it is from the gods themselves, via the simulacra\nthat reach us from their abode, that we derive our image of blessed\nhappiness, and prayer for the Epicureans consisted not in petitioning\nfavors but rather in a receptivity to this vision. (Epicurus\nencouraged the practice of the conventional cults.) Although they held\nthe gods to be immortal and indestructible (how this might work in a\nmaterialist universe remains unclear), human pleasure might\nnevertheless equal divine, since pleasure, Epicurus maintained\n(KD 19), is not augmented by duration (compare the idea of\nperfect health, which is not more perfect for lasting longer); the\ncatastematic pleasure experienced by a human being completely free of\nmental distress and with no bodily pain to disturb him or her is at\nthe absolute top of the scale. Nor is such pleasure difficult to\nachieve: it is a mark precisely of those desires that are neither\nnatural nor necessary that they are hard to satisfy. Epicurus was\nfamously content with little, since on such a diet a small delicacy is\nas good as a feast, in addition to which it is easier to achieve\nself-sufficiency, and \u201cthe greatest benefit of self-sufficiency\nis freedom\u201d (VS 77).\n",
