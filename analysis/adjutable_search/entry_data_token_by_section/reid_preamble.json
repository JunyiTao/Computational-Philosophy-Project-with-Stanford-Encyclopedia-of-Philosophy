    "main_text": "\n\n\nThomas Reid (1710\u20131796) is a Scottish philosopher best known for his\nphilosophical method, his theory of perception and its wide\nimplications on epistemology, and as the developer and defender of an\nagent-causal theory of free will. In these and other areas he offers\nperceptive and important criticisms of the philosophy of Locke,\nBerkeley and especially Hume. He is also well known for his criticisms\nof Locke's view of personal identity and Hume's view of\ncausation. Reid also made influential contributions to philosophical\ntopics including ethics, aesthetics and the philosophy of mind. The\nlegacy of Thomas Reid's philosophical work is found in contemporary\ntheories of perception, free will, philosophy of religion, and widely\nin epistemology.\n\nAfter studying at the University of Aberdeen, Reid entered the\nministry in New Machar in 1737. In 1748 he published a short essay\nentitled \u201cAn Essay on Quantity\u201d concerning\nHutcheson's Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of Beauty and\nVirtue. Although this was his only published work, he was given a\nprofessorship at King's College Aberdeen in 1752. There he\npublished An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of\nCommon Sense (or \u2018IHM\u2019) in 1764. Later he received a prestigious\nprofessorship at the University of Glasgow. He resigned from this\nposition in 1781 in order to give himself more time to write, and\npublished Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (or \u2018EIP\u2019)\nin 1785 and Essays on the Active Powers of Man (or \u2018EAP\u2019) in\n1788. These three books, along with four additional books composed of\npapers, essays and more, have been recently republished in the\nEdinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid.\n\nIn the Inquiry, a methodologically pioneering work due to its\nextensive and rigorous use of observational data to justify claims\nabout perception, Reid examines each of the five senses and discusses\nthe ways in which we achieve knowledge of the world by employing\nthem. Intellectual Powers expands his system beyond the\napprehension of the world through the senses to consideration of\nmemory, imagination, knowledge, the nature of judgment, reasoning and\ntaste. The Active Powers examines a collection of topics\nconcerning ethics, the nature of agency generally, and the distinctive\nfeatures of human agency.\n",
