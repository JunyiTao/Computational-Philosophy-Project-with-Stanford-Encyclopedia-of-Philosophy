    "main_text": "Arguments against PAP || Volitional Necessity\n3.3 Volitional Necessity\n\nBrought before Charles V and ordered to recant, Luther refused, saying\n(according to tradition), \u201cHere I stand. I can do no\nother\u201d. If we can take his word for it, Luther was compelled by\nhis conscience. Yet we still praise him for refusing, in spite of his\ninability to do otherwise. Indeed, his being compelled by conscience\nmay enhance our moral admiration. Such cases of \u201cvolitional\nnecessity\u201d (Frankfurt 1982) are prima facie\ncounterexamples to PAP. Sometimes when we act, alternatives are\n\u201cunthinkable\u201d: if a normal person is offered money to\ntorture someone, that person will have no option but to refuse\n(Dennett 1984a). Again, this lack of alternatives is compatible with,\nand even enhances, moral praise. (See also Wolf 1980; Nelkin 2011, in\nwhich the goodness of the determined act plays an important role.)\nSuch cases are similar to the compelled actions considered in the\nprevious section, but there\u2019s at least this difference: in those\nearlier cases, what compels is something \u201calien\u201d to the\nagent: a cart, fate, an irresistible desire for a drug. But here,\ncompulsion comes only from the agent\u2019s own internalized system\nof values. This might explain why praise is more forthcoming.\n\nNevertheless, a defender of PAP could question whether such agents are\nresponsible in the sense we\u2019re concerned with here. Reid notes\nthat Cato was said to be \u201cgood because he could not be\notherwise\u201d. Reid replies: \n\n\nthis saying, if understood literally and strictly, is not the praise\nof Cato, but of his constitution, which was no more the work of Cato,\nthan his existence. (Reid 1788, IV.1; quoted in Chisholm 1966) \n\n\nPraising Cato\u2019s character, we conflate this with moral credit\nand thereby hold him responsible. Carefully avoid this mistake, and\ncases of volitional necessity no longer appear to be counterexamples\nto PAP.\n\nBut a more common reply to such examples is to clarify our principle\nby allowing the relevant alternatives to occur before the time of\nacting. Insofar as Luther should be praised for his refusal,\nit\u2019s because the character compelling the action was itself the\nresult of Luther\u2019s past choices in which he could have done\notherwise. This important qualification to PAP, sometimes called\n\u201ctracing\u201d, has been standard since Aristotle\n(Nicomachean Ethics iii.v; cp. John Locke 1689: II.xxi.56; C.\nA. Campbell 1957; Lamb 1993; Kane 1996: 39\u201340). Only by moral\nstruggle, choosing a certain path among the many available, did Luther\nfinally arrive at a point in which his character and conscience\nnecessitated his actions. In light of this, let us formulate PAP with\nan additional clause (closely following Mele 1999: 282):\n\n\nPAP-historical: a person is morally responsible for\nwhat she has done at time t only if (i) she could have done\notherwise at t, or (ii) even though she could not have done\notherwise at t, the psychological character on the basis of\nwhich she acted at t is itself partially a product of an\nearlier action (or actions) of hers which was performed at a time when\nshe could have done otherwise.\n\n\nThis less demanding version of PAP was needed all along, even for more\nordinary cases. Tom, who becomes violent when drunk, couldn\u2019t\nhelp himself when he punched someone: Tom\u2019s intoxication put him\nat the mercy of his anger. Yet, assuming other conditions on\nresponsibility are met, we should blame him, especially when learning\nthat he willingly drank beforehand. It\u2019s the prior act of\ndrinking for which Tom had alternatives, and it\u2019s these\nalternatives, not those at the time of action, that satisfy our new\ncondition.\n\nHenceforth let PAP and similar principles have such a historical\nrider, at least implicitly (so \u201cPAP\u201d below can be read as\nshort for \u201cPAP-historical\u201d). The principle\u2019s\ndefenders can then allow a wide range of cases\u2014willing\nincapacitation, moral saintliness, confrontation with the\n\u201cunthinkable\u201d\u2014in which a person is responsible for\nacting without, at the time, having alternatives. To test PAP, then,\none must go to \u201cthe source\u201d and look at cases in which the\nhistorical clause is not relevant to the agent\u2019s moral\nresponsibility. Stipulate that the actions to be considered below,\nunless otherwise stated, are those for which, if the agent is\nresponsible at all, she is \u201cdirectly\u201d responsible\n(Zimmerman 1988: ch. 3). Perhaps such actions are what Kane (1996)\ncalls \u201cself-forming willings\u201d, foundational choices that\nshape the characters that later constrain, or even fix, future action\n(cp. Klein 1990: 58).\n",
