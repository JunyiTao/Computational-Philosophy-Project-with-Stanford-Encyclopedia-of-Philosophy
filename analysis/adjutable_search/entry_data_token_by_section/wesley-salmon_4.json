    "main_text": "Probability and Induction || Criticism of Other Interpretations of Probability\n2.3 Criticism of Other Interpretations of Probability\n\nIn The Foundations of Scientific Inference Salmon compared\nthe major interpretations of probability against three criteria:\nadmissibility, ascertainability, and applicability.\nAdmissibility requires satisfaction of the formal properties\nof probability spelled out by the probability calculus;\nascertainability demands that there must exist a method of\nascertaining the values of probability; applicability\nstipulates that the concept of probability must have a practical\npredictive import.\n\nLaplace\u2019s classical interpretation was deemed defective\nwith respect to admissibility, because it suffers from the difficulty\nknown as \u201cBertrand\u2019s paradox\u201d, which applies to\nproblems involving an infinite range of possibilities, in which case\nthe classical definition can lead to conflicting probability values.\nSalmon also considered the subjective interpretation,\naccording to which probability \u201cis simply a measure of degree of\nbelief\u201d, to be inadmissible (Salmon 1967a: 68). Salmon dealt\nseparately with the interpretation he called personalistic,\nwhich he attributed to Savage. The distinctive feature of this\napproach\u2014matching what is meant by the subjective interpretation\ntoday \u2013 is that it appeals to the betting scheme in order to\ndetermine probability values, and imposes coherence on systems of\nbets. Salmon claimed that the personalistic outlook satisfies the\ncriteria of admissibility and ascertainability, but does not comply\nwith applicability because it\n\n\nleaves entirely unanswered our questions about inductive inference. It\ntolerates any kind of inference from the observed to the\nunobserved. (Salmon 1967a: 82)\n\n\nApplicability also represented an obstacle for the logical\ninterpretation, which was reputed \u201cto provide no basis for\nexpecting the probable in preference to the improbable\u201d (Salmon\n1967a: 79). In Salmon 1967a and elsewhere, notably Salmon 1967b, 1969\n[2005], and 1975b [2005], Salmon discussed in great detail\nCarnap\u2019s inductive logic, which he rated highly for shedding\nlight on a number of important aspects of confirmation and induction.\nAt the same time, he deemed that\n\n\nthe conception of inductive logic as based upon a logical relation is\nfundamentally misconceived [\u2026] although deductive logic\nrequires and exploits logical relevance relations, induction is\ninvolved with factual relevance relations instead. (Salmon 1969 [2005:\n202])\n\n\nMoreover, Salmon disagreed with Carnap\u2019s justification of\ninduction in terms of inductive intuition (Carnap 1968). Salmon held\nthe frequency interpretation to come closest to satisfying\nall of the adequacy requirements, although it faced serious\ndifficulties with ascertainability, especially in connection with\nsingle case probability attributions. However, Salmon deemed the\nsolution promising in terms of weight referred to homogeneous\nreference classes\n (\u00a7 2.1).\n In addition, he regarded the frequency theory as the only\ninterpretation offering a viable approach to the justification of\ninduction.\n\nIn 1979d Salmon discussed the propensity interpretation put\nforward by Popper to solve the single case problem arising within\nquantum mechanics. The idea is that probability should be taken as a\ndispositional property of the experimental set-up, or the generating\nconditions of experiments, liable to be reproduced over and over again\nto form a sequence (Popper 1959). Salmon argued that Popper\u2019s\nproposal fares no better than the frequentist way of attaching\nprobability values to single occurrences of events. In fact, the\ndifficulties faced by frequentists in connection with identifying\nhomogeneous reference classes are displaced rather than solved by the\npropensity account, which requires completeness of information in\norder to describe the chance set-up generating propensities.\n\nIn addition, Salmon endorsed Paul Humphreys\u2019 objection that\npropensities cannot qualify as probabilities because their\ndispositional character ascribes them a peculiar asymmetry that goes\nin the opposite direction from that characterizing inverse\nprobability, making the propensity theory inapplicable to Bayes\u2019\nrule (Humphreys 1985). To take Salmon\u2019s example,\n\n\nsuppose we are given a set of probabilities from which we can deduce\nthat the probability that a certain person died as a result of being\nshot through the head is \u00be. It would be strange, under these\ncircumstances, to say that this corpse has a propensity (tendency?) of\n\u00be to have had its skull perforated by a bullet. (Salmon 1979d:\n213)\n\n\nWhile clashing with the symmetrical character of probabilities, the\nasymmetry of propensities matches that of the causal relation. In view\nof this, Salmon preferred to take propensities to be probabilistic\ncausal tendencies rather than probabilities (see\n \u00a7 5.6).\n\nFurther reading: On Reichenbach see Salmon 1979a; Glymour\n& Eberhardt 2008 [2016]; and the 2011 special issue of the journal\nSynthese 181(1). On the interpretation of probability see\nGillies 2000; Galavotti 2005; and H\u00e1jek 2002 [2012]. The debate\non context of discovery vs. context of justification is surveyed in\nSchickore 2014.
