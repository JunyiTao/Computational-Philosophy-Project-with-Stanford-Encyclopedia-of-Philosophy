    "main_text": "The sense of body ownership || The cognitive conception\n4.3 The cognitive conception\n\nInstead of appealing to the way one perceives one\u2019s\nbody, one can appeal to the way one thinks about one\u2019s\nbody in order to account for the sense of ownership: \n\n\nA cognitive account of the sense of ownership holds that one\nexperiences something as one\u2019s own only if one thinks of\nsomething as one\u2019s own. (Alsmith 2015: 881) \n\n\nThe cognitive conception does not preclude the existence of a\nphenomenology of ownership, at least if one grants the possibility of\ncognitive phenomenology (as in noetic feelings, for instance).\n\nThe question then is how to account for the fact that the sense of\nownership (or its lack) is cognitively impenetrable. Participants in\nthe rubber hand experiment are aware that the rubber hand is a fake\nhand and they rarely endorse the belief that the rubber hand is their\nown hand. Vice-versa: some patients know that their hand belongs to\nthem, and yet it still seems to them as if it did not, as\ndescribed by this patient: \u2018my eyes and my feelings don\u2019t\nagree, and I must believe my feelings. I know they look like mine, but\nI can feel they are not, and I can\u2019t believe my eyes\u2019\n(Nielsen 1938: 555). Cognitive impenetrability is classically taken as\nthe signature of experiential states. For instance, in the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion one cannot help but experience the two lines\nas being different despite having the belief that they are actually of\nthe same size. However, there are attitudes other than feelings and\nsensations that can be immune to the influence of beliefs (McDowell\n2011). The question then is what kind of attitude: propositional\nimagination (Alsmith 2015), agreement towards a proposition (Wu\nforthcoming), perceptual seeming (Lyons 2011), or alief (Gendler\n2008). Whatever attitude it may be, it will have to be not only\ncognitive impenetrable, but also beyond the subject\u2019s control.\nSubjects cannot decide at will to experience the rubber hand illusion.\nIn the case of disownership syndromes, it also seems that the attitude\nthey are in should be affectively-loaded. Patients indeed are greatly\ndistressed when they report that they do not feel their hand as their\nown.\n",
