    "main_text": "Epistemology\n2. Epistemology\n\nThe examination of \u201creliable cognition\u201d (tshad\nma) is the core subject of Buddhist epistemological works in\nIndia and Tibet. In the Tibetan tradition, it is subsumed under the\nbroader enterprise of classification of \u201cmind\u201d or\n\u201cmental episodes\u201d (Tib. blo) and involves the\ndetermination of the objects which the respective cognitions bear on.\nTibetan authors typically proceed by establishing various typologies\nof objects and of mental episodes and elucidating the various ways in\nwhich mental episodes are related to objects. Mental episodes are\nassociated with different operations and are categorized via\nprogressive subdivisions based on criteria that are also instrumental\nin defining reliable cognition. The characterization of the different\ntypes of objects, in particular within the typology of\n\u201capprehended objects\u201d (see 2.1.2, a), is tied with the\nadoption of a specific ontological and epistemological framework. \n\n",
