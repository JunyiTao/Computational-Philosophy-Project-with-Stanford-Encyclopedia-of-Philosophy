Descriptive and Normative Concepts of Political Legitimacy\n\nIf legitimacy is interpreted descriptively, it refers to\npeople\u2019s beliefs about political authority and, sometimes,\npolitical obligations. In his sociology, Max Weber put forward a very\ninfluential account of legitimacy that excludes any recourse to\nnormative criteria (Mommsen 1989: 20, but see Greene 2017 for an\nalternative reading). According to Weber, that a political regime is\nlegitimate means that its participants have certain beliefs or faith\n(\u201cLegitimit\u00e4tsglaube\u201d) in regard to it: \u201cthe\nbasis of every system of authority, and correspondingly of every kind\nof willingness to obey, is a belief, a belief by virtue of which\npersons exercising authority are lent prestige\u201d (Weber 1964:\n382). As is well known, Weber distinguishes among three main sources\nof legitimacy\u2014understood as the acceptance both of authority and\nof the need to obey its commands. People may have faith in a\nparticular political or social order because it has been there for a\nlong time (tradition), because they have faith in the rulers\n(charisma), or because they trust its legality\u2014specifically the\nrationality of the rule of law (Weber 2009 [1918]; 1964). Weber\nidentifies legitimacy as an important explanatory category for social\nscience, because faith in a particular social order produces social\nregularities that are more stable than those that result from the\npursuit of self-interest or from habitual rule-following (Weber 1964:\n124).\n\nIn contrast to Weber\u2019s descriptive concept, the normative\nconcept of political legitimacy refers to some benchmark of\nacceptability or justification of political power or authority\nand\u2014possibly\u2014obligation. On one view, held by John Rawls\n(1993) and Arthur Ripstein (2004), for example, legitimacy refers, in\nthe first instance, to the justification of coercive political power.\nWhether a political body such as a state is legitimate and whether\ncitizens have political obligations towards it depends on whether the\ncoercive political power that the state exercises is justified. On a\nwidely held alternative view, legitimacy is linked to the\njustification of political authority. On this view, political bodies\nsuch as states may be effective, or de facto, authorities,\nwithout being legitimate. They claim the right to rule and to create\nobligations to be obeyed, and as long as these claims are met with\nsufficient acquiescence, they are authoritative. Legitimate authority,\non this view, differs from merely effective or de facto\nauthority in that it actually holds the right to rule and creates\npolitical obligations (e.g., Raz 1986). On some views, even legitimate\nauthority is not sufficient to create political obligations. The\nthought is that a political authority (such as a state) may be\npermitted to issue commands that citizens are not obligated to obey\n(Dworkin 1986: 191). Based on a view of this sort, some have argued\nthat legitimate political authority only gives rise to political\nobligations if additional normative conditions are satisfied (e.g.\nWellman 1996; Edmundson 1998; Buchanan 2002).\n\nThere is sometimes a tendency in the literature to equate the\nnormative concept of legitimacy with justice. Some explicitly define\nlegitimacy as a criterion of minimal justice (e.g., Hampton 1998;\nBuchanan 2002). Someone might claim, for example, that while political\ninstitutions such as states are often unjust, only a just state is\nmorally acceptable and legitimate in this sense. Unfortunately, there\nis sometimes also a tendency to blur the distinction between the two\nconcepts, and a lot of confusion arises from that. Rawls (1993, 1995)\nclearly distinguishes between the two concepts. In his view, while\njustice and legitimacy are related\u2014they draw on the same set of\npolitical values\u2014they have different domains and legitimacy\nmakes weaker demands than justice (1993: 225; 1995: 175ff.). Political\ninstitutions may be legitimate but unjust, but the converse is not\npossible: just political institutions are necessarily legitimate (see\nalso Langvatn 2016 on this). On other views, legitimacy and justice\nhave different normative foundations (e.g., Simmons 2001; Pettit 2012).\nAccording to Pettit (2012: 130ff), a state is just if it imposes a\nsocial order that promotes freedom as non-domination for all its\ncitizens. It is legitimate if it imposes a social order in an\nappropriate way. A state that fails to impose a social order in an\nappropriate way, however just the social order may be, is\nillegitimate. Vice versa, a legitimate state may fail to impose a just\nsocial order.\n\nRealist political theorists criticize any tendency to blur the\ndistinction between legitimacy and justice (e.g., Rossi and Sleat\n2014). They diagnose it as a sign of misplaced \u201cpolitical\nmoralism\u201d (Williams 2005; Horton 2010), or, relatedly, as a\nmisleading interpretation of political theory as a branch of applied\nethics (e.g., Honig 1993). But they also want to carve out an\nalternative to a purely descriptive interpretation of legitimacy.\nBernard Williams\u2019s claim (2005: 4ff) that political institutions\nare subject to a \u201cbasic legitimation demand\u201d has been very\ninfluential in this regard. According to Williams, the first political\nquestion is how a state provides basic political goods such as\nsecurity and stability and the conditions for cooperation. That it\nprovides these goods is a necessary requirement for legitimacy, but it\nis not sufficient. A state is also under the normative expectation to\njustify how it provides these goods. That normative expectation is the\ndistinctively political basic legitimation demand.\n\nBy interpreting the concept of political legitimacy along those lines,\npolitical realists lend support to those who have questioned a sharp\ndistinction between the descriptive and normative concepts of\nlegitimacy (e.g., Habermas 1979; Beetham 1991; Horton 2012). The\nobjection to a strictly normative concept of legitimacy is that it is\nof only limited use in understanding actual processes of legitimation.\nThe charge is that philosophers tend to focus too much on the general\nconditions necessary for the justification of political institutions\nbut neglect the historical actualization of the justificatory process.\nIn J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 words (Habermas 1979: 205):\n\u201cEvery general theory of justification remains peculiarly\nabstract in relation to the historical forms of legitimate domination.\n\u2026 Is there an alternative to this historical injustice of\ngeneral theories, on the one hand, and the standardlessness of mere\nhistorical understanding, on the other?\u201d The objection to a\npurely descriptive concept such as Weber\u2019s is that it neglects\npeople\u2019s second order beliefs about legitimacy\u2014their\nbeliefs, not just about the actual legitimacy of a particular\npolitical institution, but about the justifiability of this\ninstitution, i.e. about what is necessary for legitimacy. According to\nBeetham, a \u201cpower relationship is not legitimate because people\nbelieve in its legitimacy, but because it can be justified in\nterms of their beliefs\u201d (Beetham 1991: 11). As Tommie\nShelby (2007) has highlighted, from the point of view of oppressed\nminorities political institutions often lack legitimacy because they\n(rightly) perceive the social order to be unjust.\n\nA key claim of political realism is that while legitimacy is a\nnormative property of political institutions or decisions, its\nnormativity is not (just) moral (e.g., Rossi 2012, Sleat 2014). In\nsupport of this claim, some realists argue that the basic legitimation\ndemand can\u2019t be satisfied just by appeal to moral arguments, for\nexample because political processes are necessary to forge political\nagreements (Stears 2007). Others focus on the role of epistemic\nnormativity (see the discussion in Burelli and Destri 2022). But, as\nLeader Maynard and Worsnip (2018) ask, is there a distinct political\nnormativity that political realists could resort to? Or does normative\npolitical philosophy have resources to address the realists\u2019\nworries? A possible reply to these questions is that realist political\ntheory is less concerned with the nature of normativity than with\ndrawing attention to neglected topics in political theory (Baderin\n2014; Jubb 2019). But this raises the further question whether there\nis a unified project at the core of political realism, or whether it\nis better seen as the intersection of different projects motivated by\na range of meta-normative, normative, and political concerns.\n",
