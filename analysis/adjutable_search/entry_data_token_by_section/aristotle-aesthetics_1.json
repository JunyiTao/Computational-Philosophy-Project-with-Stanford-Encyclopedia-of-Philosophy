Homeric Problems: How to Defend Poetry?\n\nLiterary criticism is at the very core of the other major published\nwork dealing with poetry, the so-called Homeric Problems. One\ncannot overestimate the role and importance of Homer in ancient Greek\nculture: he is commonly called \u201cthe poet\u201d, and every\neducated Greek person knows many passages by heart. And yet, Homer had\nalso been harshly criticized from very early on, notably by Xenophanes\nand Heraclitus, who reproached Homer for giving wrong images of the\ngods. This is in part because both read Homer literally, as if Homer\nwere describing the real world of the gods. Plato famously follows\nsuit: he too addresses the way people usually read Homeric epics as a\nsort of moral description and prescription of right and wrong\nbehaviors; and since gods and heroes are to be taken as our moral\nparadigms, we must condemn (and withdraw or perhaps rewrite) the\nnumerous passages where those gods and heroes commit wrongdoings. In\nturn, those critiques provoked equally strong reactions aimed at\ndefending the poet. Some simply defended the Iliad and the\nOdyssey as offering right ethical models: after all,\naccording to Homer, Achilles is the paradigmatic example of courage,\nand Odysseus of practical intelligence and resilience. This seems to\nbe why the Socratic philosopher Antisthenes took Odysseus as one of\nhis philosophical heroes, as a man whose endurance may be seen as\nparadigmatic of the endurance required for a virtuous life. A rather\ndifferent way of defending Homer was to read his poems in an\nallegorical manner, as, notably, did the philosopher Metrodorus of\nLampsacus (a contemporary of Socrates), who interpreted many Homeric\npassages in the light of the cosmology of Anaxagoras.\n\nAristotle\u2019s Homeric Problems offers yet another manner\nof defense. As one can see from the fragments that we have, Aristotle\nnever tries to exonerate Homer\u2019s apparent shortcomings by\narguing from an ethical or allegorical perspective. What he instead\nproposes is to respond to criticisms made against Homer from an\nart-centered perspective. He sought to determine, that is, how such\nand such a passage or verse should be judged by reference to the aim\nor function of the art of poetry, considered as art and in no other\nway. As he clearly states in the Poetics, which seems to\nrecap how he presented his material in the Homeric Problems:\n\n\n\nIt is not the same criterion of correctness that applies in poetry and\nin politics, nor in poetry and in any other art. (25,\n1460b13\u201315) \n\n\nJudging poetry from the perspective of another domain, such as\npolitics, biology or psychology, would be a methodological mistake,\nsince their respective aim or function is not the same. In response to\nethical condemnations faulting Homer for depicting the gods in a\nmorally bad fashion, Aristotle calmly answers: \n\n\nIt is quite possible that the poets speak about them neither by\nidealizing them nor in a true way, and that things are as indeed as\nXenophanes states: but in any case, it is how people speak of them.\n(1460b36\u201361a1) \n\n\nAristotle seems to agree with Xenophanes that it is wrong to believe\nthat the gods look like human beings and share our bad behaviors; but\nthe poets must take into account how people generally imagine them to\nbe if they want to have them intervening in their plots. For\nrepresenting the gods as morally good beings would actually make\nHomer\u2019s epics rather odd to the people they were addressed to,\nwhich would have disturbed their involvement in the plot, and spoilt\ntheir pleasure. Another example comes from the scene in which Achilles\npursues Hector: the way Achilles prevents the army from taking up arms\nagainst him and lets him go by a simple nod of the head is, from a\npsychological point of view, totally implausible (1460a14\u201316;\nIliad 22, 205\u2013206). But this is not an error we have to\nblame Homer for, Aristotle replies, since this adds to the effect of\nwonder, which is part of our pleasure: even if it is a mistake from a\npsychological perspective, \n\n\nit is right if it achieves poetry\u2019s aim [\u2026], if that way\nan even more striking effect is produced in that part of the poem or\nat a later stage. (1460b24\u201326) \n\n\nIn Homeric Problems, Aristotle presumably only dealt with\nHomer. But in Poetics 25, he wants to extend his approach to\ntragedy. One example concerns Menelaus in Euripides\u2019\nOrestes. There Aristotle agrees (presumably with other\ncritics) that Euripides made a mistake in representing him as a coward\n(15, 1454a28\u201329; 25, 1461b19\u201321)\u2014but not for ethical\nreasons. The offense is purely \u201cpoetical\u201d or\n\u201cartistic\u201d: since pity and fear require that we admire the\nheroes on stage, having a base character must jeopardize the\naudience\u2019s emotional reaction; if, on the other hand, the plot\nrequires having such a hero (which is not the case in that play), that\nwould not be a fault. One will also notice that Aristotle takes for\ngranted that we can extend such views to the other domains of art.\nAnother example is that of the painting of a horse \u201cwith two\nright legs stretched out towards the front\u201d (1460b18\u201318).\nAristotle believes (wrongly, as it happens) that this is physically\nimpossible. Still, he avers that we must not judge the quality of the\npainting from a biological point of view. On the contrary, if the\nhorse\u2019s galloping in such a way effects a stronger emotional\nreaction in the viewer, that is the right way to represent it!\n",
