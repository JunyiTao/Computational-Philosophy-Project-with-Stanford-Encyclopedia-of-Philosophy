    "main_text": "Eliminative vs. Non-Eliminative Structuralism || Towards a First Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions\n1.3 Towards a First Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions\n\nFrom the late 1980s on, Shapiro\u2019s and Hellman\u2019s positions\nhave often been treated as the two main structuralist options.  (This\nis still reflected in Hellman & Shapiro 2019.)  As they are quite\ndifferent, this already indicates that it is wrong to see\n\u201cstructuralism in the philosophy of mathematics\u201d as a\nunique position or a unified perspective, even though certain general\nslogans are shared. Beyond that, other versions of structuralism\nstarted to play a role in the late 1980s and early 1990s (including\nforms of \u201cset-theoretic structuralism\u201d that go back\nfurther in time than the 1960s, as we will see). Consequently, the\ndiscussions about structuralism have become both richer and more\ncomplex.\n\nTo clarify this situation, Charles Parsons suggested a first taxonomy,\nor at least a distinction between two main kinds of positions (Parsons\n1990). Namely, there are \u201celiminative\u201d forms of\nstructuralism, as illustrated paradigmatically by Hellman; and there\nare \u201cnon-eliminative\u201d forms of structuralism, like\nShapiro\u2019s. (The elimination at issue concerns the postulation,\nor avoidance thereof, of structures as abstract objects.) Or put in\nHellman\u2019s slightly later terminology, there is\n\u201cstructuralism without structures\u201d, on the one hand, and\n\u201cstructuralism with structures\u201d, on the other\nhand. Besides Shapiro and Resnik (with the qualifications above),\nanother proponent of the non-eliminative form is Parsons himself (see\nParsons 1990, 2004, and, most systematically, 2008); and another\nproponent of the eliminative form of structuralism is Charles Chihara\n(cf. Chihara 2004). \n\nNevertheless, it seems to have been tempting, and has remained fairly\nwidespread in the literature, to identify non-eliminative\nstructuralism with Shapiro\u2019s position, i.e., with his realist\nand ante rem version. In fact, critics sometimes dismiss\n\u201cphilosophical structuralism\u201d generally as a misguided\nform of metaphysics, thereby identifying such structuralism with\nShapiro\u2019s realist form. (This seems especially tempting for\nmathematicians and for philosophers rooted deeply in mathematical\npractice; cf. Awodey 1996 and Carter 2008 for related discussions.) A\nfurther consideration of Parsons\u2019 form of non-eliminative\nstructuralism can help to show that this is too quick and inadequate\nin the end. \n\nUnlike Shapiro, Parsons does not offer a novel, philosophically\nmotivated structure theory as the backing for his position. For him,\nwe should remain closer to mathematical practice (as it developed in\nthe late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries). In fact,\nstructuralism should be seen as growing out of that practice, rather\nthan being imposed on it from outside. For Parsons this means, among\nothers, taking abstract structures to be introduced directly by\ncategorical axiom systems, a practice he spells out further in a\n\u201cmeta-linguistic\u201d way inspired by Quine (see Parsons\n2008). It also means that we should refrain from\n\u201ccross-structural identifications\u201d (as they can be found\nin Shapiro\u2019s early works), e.g., from identifying the natural\nnumber 1 and the real number 1. Such putative identities should be\nleft indeterminate, as is done in mathematical practice.\n\nAs should be evident, Parsons\u2019 structuralist position, like\nResnik\u2019s, is less realist than Shapiro\u2019s.  Moreover, he is\nexplicit that adopting a \u201cstructuralist view of mathematical\nobjects\u201d should be seen as separable from, and orthogonal to,\nthe realism/nominalism dichotomy. Consequently, for Parsons one can be\na non-eliminative structuralist without being a realist in any strong\nsense; his own position is a case in point.  Yet Parsons\u2019\nversion of structuralism is still meant to allow taking mathematical\nstatements at face value (as characterized above), so that it remains\nrealist in this minimal semantic sense.\n",
