    "main_text": "The Ego and Its Own || Some Consequences of Egoism\n3. Stirner\u2019s Influence\n\nAt the time of his death, Stirner\u2019s brief period of notoriety\nwas long over, his book had been out of print for several years, and\nthere was little sign that his life or work might have any longer term\nimpact.\n\nHowever, in the years since, The Ego and Its Own has been\ntranslated into at least eight languages, and appeared in over one\nhundred editions. Stirner and his work have been associated with a\nhuge variety of causes, including many of which he would have been\nunaware. Stirner has been variously characterised as: a left-Hegelian;\na petit-bourgeois ideologue; a solipsist; a nihilist; the first\npoststructuralist; an existentialist; an individualist anarchist; a\nproto right libertarian; a fascist; and as simply insane (Blumenfeld\n2018: 5\u201310). Interest in the connections between Stirner and\nother thinkers \u2014 both philosophical affinity and historical\ninfluence \u2014 are also strikingly varied. For example, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, Stirner was frequently portrayed\nas a precursor of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900), as having\nanticipated, if not influenced \u2014 it is far from certain that\nNietzsche had read any Stirner \u2014 both the style and substance of\nNietzsche\u2019s work (Carus 1914: 74\u201399). In the 1960s and\nearly 1970s, Stirner was rediscovered as a forerunner of\nexistentialism, whose anti-essentialist concept of the self as a\n\u2018creative nothing\u2019 was portrayed as having affinities with\nthe notion of human nature employed by Jean-Paul Sartre\n(1905\u20131980) (Paterson 1971). More recently, Stirner has been\nidentified as a nascent poststructuralist; linked not least with\nGilles Deleuze (1925\u20131995), who also rejects the idea of a\nuniversal human nature, employs a genealogical critique of humanist\ndiscourses of power and identity, and opposes various forms of\nstate-centric thought (Newman 2009, and Feiten 2019). These parallels\ncan be plausible and interesting, although the sceptic might wonder\nwhether they don\u2019t track intellectual fashion as much as they\nilluminate aspects of Stirner\u2019s own thought.\n\nStirner\u2019s most significant historical influence is perhaps\nthreefold.\n\nFirst, The Ego and Its Own had a destructive impact on the\nconfidence and coherence of Left-Hegelianism. Stirner\u2019s\ninsistence that his radical Hegelian contemporaries had failed to\nbreak with religious modes of thought prompted most of the leading\nleft-Hegelians to defend their own work in public against this attack.\nIn perhaps the most important of these replies, Feuerbach \u2014 who\nappeared defensive and irritated (he suspected Stirner of trying to\nmake his name at Feuerbach\u2019s own expense) \u2014 was widely\nseen as struggling to maintain a besieged and outdated position. Bruno\nBauer also offered a critical response, seeking to defend his own\nphilosophy of self-consciousness against what he saw as\nStirner\u2019s inadequate form of subjectivity (Moggach and de\nRidder, 2013). Stirner replied directly to three of these\nleft-Hegelian reviews \u2014 the defence of Bauer\u2019s\n\u201chumane liberalism\u201d by \u201cSzeliga\u201d (the\npseudonym of Franz Zychlinski (1816\u20131900)); the defence of\nsocialism by Moses Hess; and the defence of Feuerbach by Feuerbach\nhimself \u2014 in an article entitled \u201cStirner\u2019s\nCritics\u201d (1845). In this confident rejoinder, Stirner reiterated\nsome of the central themes of The Ego and Its Own and\nclarified the character of his own commitment to egoism. Stirner may\nalso have provided a final reply to contemporary critics in a\npseudonymous article entitled \u201cThe Philosophical\nReactionaries\u201d, in which the author responds to a young Kuno\nFischer. (The caution is needed since the identification of \u201cG.\nEdward\u201d as Max Stirner is plausible but not incontrovertible.)\n\n\nSecond, Stirner\u2019s work played a related and significant role in\nthe evolution of the thought of Karl Marx. The latter was a\ncontemporary associate of Bauer and his entourage, and was mentioned\nindirectly in a footnote in The Ego and Its Own.\n(Stirner\u2019s footnote treats Marx as a minor, if radical,\nFeuerbachian.) Between 1845 and 1847, Marx collaborated with Friedrich\nEngels (1820\u20131895) on a group of manuscripts now usually called\nThe German Ideology, which included a fierce and sustained\nattack on their erstwhile philosophical contemporaries. Most of these\ntexts were not published at the time, and it was 1932 before this\ncritical engagement with the work of Bauer, Feuerbach, and Stirner,\nappeared fully in print. The account of Stirner contained in the\nso-called The German Ideology takes up over three hundred\npages of the published text \u2014 abridged editions have been known\nto omit much of this dense but fascinating material \u2014 and,\nalthough Marx is remorselessly critical of Stirner\u2019s position,\nit scarcely follows that The Ego and Its Own was without\ninfluence on the former\u2019s ideas. Not least, Stirner\u2019s book\nappears to have been decisive: in motivating Marx\u2019s break with\nthe work of Feuerbach (whose considerable influence on many of\nMarx\u2019s earlier writings is readily apparent); in making Marx\nreconsider the role that concepts of human nature should play in\nsocial and political philosophy; and in forcing Marx to think much\nmore clearly about whether, and in what ways, communism should be\nindividualistic.\n\nThird, and finally, Stirner\u2019s best-known work later became one\nof the founding texts of the political tradition of individualist\nanarchism. The affinity between Stirner and the anarchist tradition\nlies in his endorsement of the claim that the state is an illegitimate\ninstitution. His elaboration of this claim is an interesting and\ndistinctive one (Leopold 2006). For Stirner, a state can never be\nlegitimate, since there is a necessary conflict between individual\nself-rule and the obligation to obey the law (which stirner equates\nwith the legitimacy of the state). Given that individual self-rule\ntrumps any competing consideration, Stirner concludes that the demands\nof the state are not binding on the individual. However, he does not\nthink that individuals have, as a result, any general obligation to\noppose and attempt to eliminate the state (insofar as this is within\ntheir power). Rather the individual should decide in each particular\ncase whether or not to go along with the state\u2019s demands. Only\nin cases where there is a conflict between the autonomy of the egoist\nand the demands of the state, does Stirner recommend seeking to evade\nthe requirements of law. That said, whilst individuals have no duty to\noverthrow the state, Stirner does think that the state will eventually\ncollapse as a result of the wider spread of egoism. The cumulative\neffect of a growing egoistic disrespect for law, he suggests, would be\nto \u201cscuttle\u201d the \u201cship of state\u201d (54).\nAnarchists influenced by Stirner\u2019s individualism and his\nsuspicion of the state can be found in many countries. In Great\nBritain, for example, his ideas influenced Dora Marsden\n(1882\u20131960), and her journals The New Freewoman and\nThe Egoist. In America, James L Walker (1845\u20131904),\nauthor of The Philosophy of Egoism was interested in, and\ninfluenced by, Stirner\u2019s thought, although his best-known\nanarchist admirers in America were in the circle around Benjamin R.\nTucker (1854\u20131939) and the remarkable journal Liberty\n(founded in 1881). (For a defence of the claim that Stirner, Marsden,\nTucker, and others share a theoretical framework, see Welsh 2010.)\nHowever close the connections here, it has often been individualist\nanarchists who have proved most effective at keeping Stirner\u2019s\nideas available, producing and distributing many of the editions and\ntranslations of his work.\n\nStirner is unlikely to have regretted these various disputes about the\nnature and influence of The Ego and Its Own. In considering\nsome diverse interpretative accounts of the Bible, Stirner declines to\nadjudicate between the judgement of the child who plays with the book,\nthe Inca emperor Atahualpa (c.1502\u20131533) who threw it away when\nit failed to speak to him, the priest who praises it as the word of\nGod, and the critic who dissects it as a purely human invention. The\nplurality of interpretations of his own work might similarly have\namused Stirner and encouraged him in his view that there could be no\nlegitimate constraints on the meaning of a text. Stirner certainly\nappears relaxed about the proper interpretation of his own work. He\ninsists that he wrote only to procure an existence in the world for\nhis thoughts, adding that what subsequently happened to those ideas\n\u201cis your affair and does not trouble me\u201d (263).\n",
