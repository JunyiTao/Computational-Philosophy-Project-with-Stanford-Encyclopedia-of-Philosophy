How Concern with Needs is Covered in Some Other Prominent Debates\n\n\nFor much of this entry we have been considering needs in a societal\ncontext and have focused on needs-related responsibilities to\ncurrently existing members of our society. But questions about\nresponsibilities in connection with needs are certainly not confined\nto this context. Are nonhuman animals\u2019 needs normatively\nsalient, and if so, how should they be weighed against human needs?\nShould the needs of future generations bear on current decisions\nconcerning distributing according to need? How should the grave and\nurgent needs of those in low-income countries condition\nresponsibilities to meet less dire needs of compatriots? These kinds\nof questions raise a huge range of further issues that we cannot\ndiscuss here. Fortunately, there are several entries in this\nEncyclopedia that discuss such questions and several of these are\nlisted in the section on Related Entries below. For more on the first\nquestion\n see \n moral status of animals.\n For more on the second issue see\n intergenerational justice.\n For more on the third topic see\n global justice\n and\n international distributive justice.\n \n",
