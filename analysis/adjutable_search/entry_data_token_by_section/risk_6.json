    "main_text": "Ethics || Rights-based moral theories\n5.3 Rights-based moral theories\n\nThe problem of dealing with risk in rights-based moral theories was\nformulated by Robert Nozick: \u201cImposing how slight a probability\nof a harm that violates someone\u2019s rights also violates his\nrights?\u201d (Nozick 1974, 74).\n\nAn extension of a rights-based moral theory to indeterministic cases\ncan be obtained by prescribing that if A has a right that\nB does not bring about a certain outcome, then A\nalso has a right that B does not perform any action that (at\nall) increases the probability of that outcome. Unfortunately, such a\nstrict extension of rights is untenable in social practice.\nPresumably, A has the right not to be killed by B,\nbut it would not be reasonable to extend this right to all actions by\nB that give rise to a very small increase in the risk that\nA dies \u2014 such as driving a car in the town where\nA lives. Such a strict interpretation would make human\nsociety impossible. \n\nHence, a right not to be risk-exposed will have to be defeasible so\nthat it can be overridden in some (but not necessarily all) cases when\nthe increase in probability is small. However, it remains to find a\ncredible criterion for when it should be overridden. As Nozick\nobserved, a probability limit is not credible in \u201ca tradition\nwhich holds that stealing a penny or a pin or anything from someone\nviolates his rights. That tradition does not select a\nthreshold measure of harm as a lower limit, in the case of harms\ncertain to occur\u201d (Nozick 1974, 75).\n",
