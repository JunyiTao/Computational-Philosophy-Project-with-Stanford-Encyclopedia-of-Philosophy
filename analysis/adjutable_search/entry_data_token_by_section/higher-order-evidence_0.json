We can come\nacross higher-order evidence in a variety of ways: brain-altering\nconditions like hypoxia, or drugs, but also more mundane sources like\nbias and fatigue. Many epistemologists have discussed\ndisagreement as a source of higher-order evidence: if an\nequally well-informed and thoughtful person looks at the evidence and\ndraws a different conclusion from yours, this arguably gives you\nreason to worry that you\u2019ve made a rational error (see, e.g.,\nKelly 2005, Feldman 2006, Christensen 2007b, Elga 2008 and much\nfollowing literature). And some have argued that \u201cirrelevant\ninfluences\u201d on belief, such as one\u2019s religious upbringing,\ncan be a source of higher-order evidence as well: the realization that\nyou would have had different religious beliefs if you had been raised\nin a different community, for example, might give you reason to doubt\nthe rationality of those beliefs (see Elga 2008\u2014see Other\nInternet Resources, White 2010, and Vavova 2018). It is hard to find\nan uncontroversial definition of higher-order evidence, as different\nauthors understand it in different ways. But even without a general\ndefinition, we can look at cases like Hypoxia to see how higher-order\nevidence is importantly distinctive. (This section assumes that\nhigher-order evidence has some first-order rational import, as this is\nwhere the distinctive features arise.)\n\nAt first glance, one might think that Hypoxia is simply a case of\nundercutting defeat, and Aisha\u2019s justification for believing\nG is defeated just as one\u2019s perceptual beliefs might be\ndefeated by, for instance, evidence of tricky lighting. But as Feldman\n(2005) argues, higher-order defeat and undercutting defeat are\nimportantly different. Compare Hypoxia to a case in which you find out\nthat a certain wall, which appears to be red, is illuminated by a red\nlight. In the latter case, you might recognize that your experience as\nof a red wall generally supports the belief that the wall is\nred, and also recognize that you responded appropriately to that\nevidence before finding out about the tricky lighting. But in Hypoxia\nit seems that Aisha is not in a position to recognize either of these\nthings. If she takes her higher-order evidence seriously, she will\ncome to doubt whether her first-order evidence ever supported\nG in the first place. And she will also doubt whether she\nevaluated it correctly. (See Coates 2012 and Christensen 2010a for\nsimilar discussion.) So higher-order defeat is not simply undercutting\ndefeat.\n\nJoshua DiPaolo (2018) argues that higher-order defeat is also\ndistinctive in that it is \u201cobject-independent\u201d. For\ninstance, learning that there is a red light on the wall will undercut\nyour belief that the wall is red, but will have no effect if you\nbelieve that the wall is not red. Higher-order evidence, on the other\nhand, typically does not discriminate based on the contents of the\nbeliefs it targets. Extending DiPaolo\u2019s argument to our case\nabove, Aisha\u2019s higher-order evidence targeted her belief about\nG, but could have easily targeted a belief with different\ncontents if she had been reasoning about a different matter while\nflying at that altitude.\n\nChristensen (2010a) argues that higher-order evidence is distinctive\nbecause its import is agent-relative. While Aisha's information about\nhypoxia gives Aisha reason to doubt her beliefs about whether\nshe will make it to Hawaii, it would have no such effect on another\nperson looking at the same charts and dials from the safety of the\nground. However, merely treating higher-order evidence as indexical\ndoes not seem to make it less puzzling; see Schoenfield 2018 for\nfurther discussion.\n\nPerhaps the most puzzling feature of higher-order evidence is that it\nseems to obligate agents to ignore or set aside parts of their total\nevidence. (See Christensen 2010a for an early defense of this idea;\nothers, including Elga (2007), also defend it in the context of\ndisagreement.) Even as Aisha comes to doubt her conclusion about\nG, her first-order evidence and reasoning is still plainly\nbefore her. But she cannot rationally appeal to it in forming her\nbeliefs. If she could, Aisha might argue:\n\n\nalthough I\u2019m at an altitude that renders me susceptible to\nhypoxia, I must be immune. After all, my first-order evidence in fact\nsupports the conclusion that I have enough fuel to make it to Hawaii,\nand that\u2019s the very same conclusion I reached!\n\n\nTo a supporter of higher-order defeat, such reasoning looks irrational\nand dogmatic. (Furthermore, if she could reason this way, Aisha could\narguably keep her high confidence in G\u2014which his just\nto say, her higher-order evidence wouldn\u2019t have a rational\neffect after all.) In order to rule out the rationality of such\nreasoning, while acknowledging that Aisha\u2019s first-order evidence\nhas not vanished, some epistemologists say that Aisha must set aside\nthe targeted first-order evidence and reasoning once her higher-order\nevidence comes in. This thought is often called\n\u201cIndependence\u201d.\n Section 3.1\n discusses it in more detail.\n\nFinally, related to this last observation, Horowitz (2019) and\nSchoenfield (2015b, 2018) both argue that higher-order evidence is\npredictably misleading: if it has first-order effects, we can predict\na priori that it will lead ideally rational thinkers away\nfrom the truth. We expect first-order evidence to generally make us\nmore accurate, provided that we respond to it rationally. And we\nexpect higher-order evidence to lead us away from what our first-order\nevidence supports. So when we accommodate all of that evidence\nrationally, we\u2019ll tend to end up with a less accurate\nbelief state than we would if we had ignored the higher-order\nevidence.\n\nIn all of these ways, higher-order evidence presents distinctive\nproblems for epistemology. (Though distinctive does not necessarily\nmean rare: Hedden and Dorst [forthcoming] argue that almost all\nevidence has higher-order import.) As we will see in the next section,\nthe difficulties presented by higher-order evidence have prompted some\nepistemologists to deny that it has first-order import altogether.\n",
