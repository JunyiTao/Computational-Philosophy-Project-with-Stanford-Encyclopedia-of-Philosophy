    "preamble": "\n\nDavid Lewis produced a body of philosophical writing that, in four\nbooks and scores of articles, spanned every major philosophical area,\nwith perhaps the greatest concentration in metaphysics, philosophy of\nlanguage, philosophical logic, and philosophy of mind. Despite this\nastonishing variety, a newcomer to Lewis\u2019s philosophy would be\nbest advised to begin with his metaphysics (especially: 1986a, 1986e,\n1999). There are several reasons. First, the majority of Lewis\u2019s\nwork either concerns, or substantially overlaps, topics in\nmetaphysics. Second, the metaphysical positions Lewis stakes out are\nstrikingly original and powerfully argued. Third, there is a coherence\nand systematicity to this work that makes it a particularly\nappropriate object for study, in that one sees trademark Lewisian\nphilosophical maneuvers clearly on display. (Indeed, if one wished to\nlearn how to do philosophy in a Lewisian style, the most efficient way\nto do so would be to study his work in metaphysics.) Finally, and\nperhaps most interestingly, Lewis\u2019s metaphysics exerted a profound\nregulating influence on the rest of his philosophy: if some otherwise\nattractive position on some philosophical problem could not be made to\nsquare with his overall metaphysical outlook, then it would have to be\nabandoned.\n\nI should forestall one possible misunderstanding. You might think\nthat, given what I\u2019ve just said, the way Lewis would recommend\ndoing philosophy is as follows: First you figure out what your basic\nmetaphysical commitments should be; then you turn your attention to\nvarious broad but non-foundational philosophical subject matters\n(personal identity, mental content, the nature of knowledge, theory of\nvalue, etc.), and work out the consequences in each of these arenas of\nyour fundamental metaphysical posits. Nothing could be further from\nLewis\u2019s preferred methodology. (Well, maybe relying on divine\nrevelation would be further\u2026.) What he in fact recommends is a\nholistic approach: we start with the total body of claims we are\ninclined to believe\u2014whether on the basis of \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d (an oft-invoked category, for Lewis) or of\nscience\u2014and try our best to systematize it in\naccordance with standards of theoretical goodness that are themselves\nendorsed by common sense and/or science (and so are themselves, to\nsome extent, also up for grabs). A substantial portion of Lewis\u2019s\noverall body of philosophical work can thus be seen as an\nextended\u2014and breathtakingly ambitious\u2014attempt at achieving\ntotal reflective equilibrium. Here is an especially succinct\ndescription of this approach:\n\nOne comes to philosophy already endowed with a stock of opinions. It\nis not the business of philosophy either to undermine or to justify\nthese preexisting opinions, to any great extent, but only to try to\ndiscover ways of expanding them into an orderly system. (1973b, p. 88)\n\n\nStill, while Lewis\u2019s method of philosophical inquiry is certainly\nnot \u201cbottom-up\u201d, in my opinion it is best to present the\nresults of that inquiry in a bottom-up fashion. That is what\nthis essay, and ones to follow, will attempt to do. I will divide the\nterrain into four parts: Lewis\u2019s fundamental ontology; his theory\nof metaphysical modality; his \u201capplied\u201d metaphysics\n(covering such topics as laws of nature, counterfactuals, causation,\nidentity through time, and the mind); and Lewisian methodology in\nmetaphysics. I\u2019ll explain these distinctions shortly, but be\nadvised that the present essay will almost exclusively address the\nfirst of these four topics. Other aspects of Lewis\u2019s thought are\ncovered in the general entry on\n David Lewis.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Lewisian metaphysics: an overview\n\nOn a traditional conception, metaphysics aims to answer, in a suitably\nabstract and fully general manner, two questions:\n\nWhat is there?\nWhat is it (that is, whatever it is that there is)\nlike?\n\n\nLewis fully endorses this conception: for him, metaphysicians are not\nin the business merely of analyzing our \u201cconceptual\nscheme\u201d (except insofar as doing so is an effective\nmethod for finding answers to metaphysical questions), nor\nneed they pay any heed to the perennial philosophical calls for the\nabolition of their subject. They are, rather, engaged in an\nunproblematically factual inquiry into the nature of reality\u2014one\nwhose recognizable epistemological pitfalls provide no grounds for\ndoubting its legitimacy:\n\nOnce the menu of well-worked-out theories is before us, philosophy is\na matter of opinion. Is that to say that there is no truth to be had?\nOr that the truth is of our own making, and different ones of us can\nmake it differently? Not at all! If you say flatly that there is no\ngod, and I say that there are countless gods but none of them are our\nworldmates, then it may be that neither of us is making any mistake of\nmethod. We may each be bringing our opinions to equilibrium in the\nmost careful possible way, taking account of all the arguments,\ndistinctions, and counterexamples. But one of us, at least, is making\na mistake of fact. Which one is wrong depends on what there is. (Lewis\n1983a, p. xi)\n\n\nWe can begin to get a handle on Lewis\u2019s audacious and\ncomprehensive answers to our two overarching questions by\ndistinguishing three components to his metaphysical program:\n\nFirst, he offers an account of what the fundamental ontological\nstructure of the world is. Is, and must\nbe\u2014although as we\u2019ll see, that qualification turns out to be\nin a certain sense trivial. This account of fundamental ontology of\ncourse presupposes that the word \u201cfundamental\u201d\nmeans something, and in particular manages to cleanly\ndistinguish a certain central core of one\u2019s ontological\ncommitments from the rest. Suppose these commitments take the form of\nviews about what entities (or \u201cparticulars\u201d) there are,\nand what properties and relations they stand in. Then we can\ndistinguish two questions. Are some entities more fundamental than\nothers\u2014with, perhaps, an elite group of entities being the most\nfundamental? Are some properties/relations more fundamental than\nothers\u2014again, with, perhaps, an elite group being the most\nfundamental? You might find a \u201cyes\u201d answer to both\nquestions attractive. (E.g., chairs exist, but they are not\nfundamental-level entities\u2014though perhaps quarks are. Likewise,\nsome chairs have the property of being made of oak; but this\nis not a fundamental-level property\u2014though perhaps the property\nof having such-and-such electric charge is.) As for Lewis\u2019s own\nviews, with respect to the second question they are fairly\nunambiguous: He is quite clear that a proper ontology must include not\njust particulars but also properties and relations (see especially\n1983b); he is equally clear that it is a perfectly objective and\ndeterminate matter which of these properties/relations are more\nfundamental (or, in his terminology, more \u201cnatural\u201d) than\nothers (ibid.); he is officially agnostic about whether some\nproperties/relations are most fundamental, or\nperfectly natural (1986f). His views on the first question\nare, to my eyes at least, more difficult to discern\u2014but for\nreasons that, in the final analysis, probably do not matter. See\nthe\n\nSupplement on\n Fundamental Entities\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, to a very great extent he takes it that the route to\na proper theory of fundamental ontology is by way of a priori\nphilosophical inquiry. (An important qualification will be noted\nshortly.)\n\nSecond, he offers an account of modality, his famous\n\u201crealism\u201d about possible worlds. Lewis, like many\nphilosophers, takes talk of possibility and necessity to be best\nexplicated as disguised quantification over possible worlds (and\npossible inhabitants thereof), and he was endlessly ingenious at\nshowing how to use the resources provided by a theory of\n\u201cpossibilia\u201d to produce analyses of a host of modal\nlocutions. But his realism about possible worlds consists in much more\nthan inclusion of such entities into his ontology; indeed, it would\nprobably be better to call Lewis a \u201creductionist\u201d about\nmodality\u2014reductionist in a way that distinguishes him from\nvirtually every other philosopher of modality. For a typical believer\nin possible worlds will, if asked to explain what they are, give an\naccount that uses modal notions at some crucial point.\nPerhaps she will say that possible worlds are maximal\nconsistent sets of sentences (in some appropriate language);\nor perhaps she will say that they are certain kinds of maximal\nproperties that reality as a whole could have instantiated.\nLewis says no such thing: he offers a characterization of possible\nworlds\u2014and thus of modality generally\u2014in explicitly\nnon-modal terms. This complete subordination of the modal to the\nnon-modal gives his philosophy of modality a quite radical character,\nand also sheds light on some of his seemingly independent views about\nthe modalities involved in such concepts as causation, law of nature,\nand chance. (For example, Lewis rejects philosophical accounts of laws\nof nature that rely on any primitive modal notions.)\n\nThird, Lewis offers an account of how facts about everything else\nreduce to the sorts of facts laid out in his accounts of\nfundamental ontology and modality. (Note that given the remarks in the\nlast paragraph, these reductions ultimately rest on facts about\nfundamental ontology alone; no unanalyzed modal notions are\ninvolved in them.) Better: he offers an assortment of distinctive\napproaches for constructing such reductions, of which there are many\nexamples but no single, canonical exposition. At this point I wish to\nmake just three observations about these strategies. First, they can\nbe seen to be directed at providing answers to a distinctively\nmetaphysical kind of question, of the form, \u201cWhat is it for\nsuch-and-such a fact to obtain?\u201d Examples will pin down the\nidea:\n\nQuestion: What is it for an object to persist through time?\nLewis\u2019s answer: It is for that object to be constituted by\nthree-dimensional, instantaneous time-slices that exist at different\ntimes. (Lewis 1988)\nQuestion: What is it for an object to have a certain property\nessentially? Lewis\u2019s answer: It is for every one of that\nobject\u2019s counterparts in other possible worlds to have that\nproperty. (Lewis 1968)\nQuestion: What is an event? Lewis\u2019s answer: It is a certain\nkind of property of spacetime regions. (Lewis 1986d)\nQuestion: What is it for one event to be a cause of another?\nLewis\u2019s (preliminary) answer: It is for the second event to\ncounterfactually depend on the first, in the sense that had the first\nnot occurred, the second would not\n have.[1]\n (Lewis 1973a, 1986b)\nQuestion: What is an explanation of some event? Lewis\u2019s\nanswer: It is a quantity of information about that event\u2019s causes.\n(Lewis 1986c)\n\n\nAnd so on. It is this kind of question\u2014albeit not always phrased\nin this way, and accompanied by definite views about what constitutes\na philosophically appropriate answer\u2014that animate what we might\ncall Lewis\u2019s \u201capplied metaphysics\u201d: the application of\nhis basic positions in ontology and modality to a range of perennial\nmetaphysical topics. Note that the reductionist character of\nhis approach comes out when we pursue the obvious follow-up questions:\nFor example, what is it for one event to counterfactually depend on\nanother? Roughly, it is for the closest possible world in which the\nsecond does not occur to be a world in which the first does not occur.\nWhat is it for one world to be closer to actuality than another?\nWe\u2019ll skip the answer for now\u2014but rest assured that it and\nthe answers to subsequent follow-up questions are designed to hang\ntogether in such a way as to collectively display how facts about what\ncauses what ultimately reduce to facts about fundamental ontology. And\nso it goes, for personal identity, free will, the mind, knowledge,\nethics, laws of nature, you name it.\n\nThe second observation is that it remains far from clear whether we\ncan dispense with the notion of \u201creduce to\u201d (or\n\u201cdetermined by\u201d, \u201cfixed by\u201d, etc.) in favor of\nsome philosophically more sanitized alternative; see the\n\nSupplement on\n Reduction\n\n\nThe third observation I wish to make at this point is that Lewis is\nstrongly motivated by a desire for theoretical economy\u2014both with\nrespect to ontology and with respect to ideology. His quest for\nontological economy shows up in the austerity of the kinds of\nfundamental entities he admits into his ontology (he neither shows,\nnor cares to show, any economy with respect to their number).\nHis quest for ideological economy shows up in several places, but\nperhaps most notably in his utter rejection of any unanalyzed\nmodal notions, and\u2014something that hasn\u2019t been mentioned\nyet\u2014in his attempted reduction of set theory to mereology and\nplural quantification.\n\nLet\u2019s take a somewhat closer look, now, at Lewis\u2019s account of\nfundamental ontology.\n2. Fundamental ontology: A simplified version\n\nIt will be useful to start with a view that is almost\nLewis\u2019s\u2014almost, but not quite, as it is more opinionated\nthan he would be comfortable with. Stating the view takes but a few\nlines; providing the needed commentary will take longer. Thus,\nAlmost-Lewis says the following:\n\nThe only fundamental entities that are particulars\nare spacetime points.\n\nWhat these particulars are like is given by what perfectly\nnatural monadic properties they instantiate, and what perfectly\nnatural relations they stand in to one another.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. That is, the facts about what fundamental\nparticulars there are, and what perfectly natural properties and\nrelations they instantiate, determine all other facts, even modal\nfacts. Almost-Lewis\n(and Lewis) believes, of course, in other particulars besides\nspacetime points; it\u2019s just that these particulars are not\nfundamental: what it is for them to exist is to be explained, somehow,\nin terms of facts about the fundamental entities. (See the\n\nSupplement on\n Fundamental Entities\n\n\nfor some qualifications about Lewis\u2019s position.)\n\nNotice one consequence: If the facts about what fundamental\nparticulars there are, and what perfectly natural properties and\nrelations they instantiate, determine all other facts, then\nthere is no reason to suppose that composite\nparticulars\u2014particulars that have other particulars as proper\nparts\u2014ever instantiate perfectly natural monadic properties. (Of\ncourse, they can perfectly well instantiate the very-but-not-perfectly\nnatural property of having parts that instantiate\nsuch-and-such a perfectly natural relation.) Thus, if, for\nexample, my laptop has a mass of 3 kg, that is so only in a slightly\nderivative sense: the laptop is composed of parts whose masses add up\nto 3 kg. As noted, the position of Almost-Lewis is not that of\nLewis, and shortly we will need to review the key respect in which, by\nLewis\u2019s lights, it overreaches. But first we need to elaborate and\nclarify the content of Almost-Lewis\u2019s position, by means of some\ncommentary.\n\n\nFour questions demand attention: What are \u201cperfectly\nnatural\u201d properties and relations? What does it come to to say\nthat the fundamental particulars are spacetime points? What\ndoes it come to to say that they are spacetime points?\nFinally, what is the relationship between the fundamental ontology\nposited by Almost-Lewis and Lewis\u2019s own celebrated thesis of\nHumean Supervenience? Let\u2019s consider these topics in turn.\n\n3. Perfectly natural properties and relations\n\nRemember that laying out the foundations of one\u2019s ontology\nrequires two things: to say what, fundamentally, there is;\nand to say what it is like, presumably by stating some\nfacts about the fundamental entities. But not just any facts\nmatter. For example, it may be true of some of the fundamental\nentities that they coexist with at least one pig; but saying so does\nnothing to help articulate the fundamental structure of\nreality. To do that, Lewis thinks, one needs a distinction\namong the properties and relations: some are special, in that it is\ntheir pattern of instantiation among the fundamental entities\nthat constitutes the fundamental structure of reality\u2014the\n\u201cjoints\u201d along which nature is to be ultimately carved.\nThese special properties and relations are the \u201cperfectly\nnatural\u201d ones.\n\n(There are a variety of other uses to which Lewis puts the notion of\n\u201cnatural\u201d properties, some of which show that what he\nneeds is a distinction that admits of gradations, with the\nperfectly natural properties at one extreme. See the\n\nSupplement on\n The Natural/Non-natural Distinction\n\n\nfor an overview.)\n\nIt is not enough merely to appeal to such a distinction; for\nmetaphysics to do its job properly, it must also provide an\naccount. Now, one way to proceed would be to provide a theory\nof what properties and relations are, in which it is stipulated that\nall such things are to count as \u201cperfectly natural\u201d. On\nsuch an approach, while there may well be a property corresponding to\nthe predicate \u201chas mass 5 kg\u201d (for example), there will\nalmost certainly be no property corresponding to the predicate\n\u201cis green\u201d (let alone that familiar gerrymander, \u201cis\ngrue\u201d). Lewis favors a different approach. Given his commitment\nto set theory, he already believes in things that, by his\nlights, deserve to be called the property of being green, and indeed\nthe property of being grue: these are merely certain\nsets\u2014sets of actual and possible objects. (See the\nsection on Lewis\u2019s modal metaphysics in the entry on\n David Lewis,\n and the supplement on\n The Natural/Non-natural Distinction.)\n The question for him, then, is how to distinguish among\nthese sets those that are perfectly natural. Here I will present\nAlmost-Lewis as being, almost like Lewis, agnostic as between four\nbroad alternatives. (Almost, because Lewis eventually decided that the\nfirst alternative, according to which natural properties and relations\nare Aristotelian universals, is unworkable; see his 1986f for the\nreasons.)\n\nOne could adopt a theory of universals of the kind\ndeveloped by David Armstrong (1978a,1978b): \u201c\u2026we could\ncall a property [viz., set of actual and possible objects]\nperfectly natural if its members are all and only those\nthings that share some one universal.\u201d (1999 p. 13)\nOne could treat \u201cnatural\u201d as a primitive\npredicate of sets of actual and possible objects: \u201c\u2026a\nNominalist could take it as a primitive fact that some classes of\nthings are perfectly natural properties; others are\nless-than-perfectly natural to various degrees; and most are not at\nall natural. Such a Nominalist uses \u2018natural\u2019 as a\nprimitive predicate, and offers no analysis of what he means in\npredicating it of classes.\u201d (1999, p.\n 14)[2]\nOne could define \u201cnatural\u201d in terms of a suitably\ncomplex, and primitive, notion of resemblance:\n\u201cAlternatively, a Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer\nto rest with primitive objective resemblance among things.\n\u2026Then he could undertake to define natural properties in terms\nof the mutual resemblance of their members and the failure of\nresemblance between their members and their non-members.\u201d (1999,\np. 14)\nOne could adopt an ontology of tropes\u2014roughly,\nproperty-instances, entities that occupy a sort of ontological halfway\nhouse between particulars and properties. (See Lewis 1986f, Williams\n1953, Campbell 1990.)\n\n\nReturning now to Almost-Lewis\u2019s fundamental ontology, the options\nseem to be these: It might be that a spacetime point (or sequence of\npoints) instantiates a perfectly natural property (respectively,\nrelation) by instantiating a universal, in the sense of Armstrong. It\nmight be that it has it by having as one part a certain kind of trope,\nin roughly the sense of Williams. (Whence we must amend slightly, and\ntake these tropes to be the fundamental entities.) It might\nbe that it has it by belonging to a special sort of set of (actual and\nmerely possible) spacetime points\u2014special either on account of\nthe resemblances that unite its members and distinguish them from\nnon-members, or on account of simply being perfectly natural.\nRegardless of which one chooses, Lewis thinks, one\u2019s theory of\nnatural properties and relations ought to respect four\nphilosophically-motivated constraints:\n\nFirst, an adequate theory should be minimal, in the sense\nthat it posits just enough perfectly natural properties and relations\nfor their distribution among the fundamental particulars to fully and\ndeterminately fix the nature of all of reality: \u201cThe guiding\nidea, roughly, is that the world\u2019s universals should comprise a\nminimal basis for characterizing the world completely. Universals that\ndo not contribute at all to this end are unwelcome, and so are\nuniversals that contribute only redundantly.\u201d (1999, p. 12) It\nis clear from the surrounding text that Lewis takes this constraint to\ngovern the various alternatives to a universals account of\n naturalness.[3]\n\nSecond, perfectly natural properties and relations are, Lewis thinks,\nnon-modal. What, exactly, this means will need to come in for\nmore discussion. For the moment, we can take it to\nmean roughly this (though trouble for this characterization quickly\narises): the instantiation of a perfectly natural property by one\n(fundamental) particular, or of a relation by several, places\nabsolutely no constraints of a logical or metaphysical kind on the\ninstantiation of any other perfectly natural property or relation by\nthat or any other particular or particulars.\n\nThird, they are intrinsic to the particulars that instantiate\nthem\u2014which, all too roughly, means that they characterize what\nthose particulars are like, independently of what any other distinct\nparticular is like. More: The intrinsic nature of any particular is\nexhausted by what perfectly natural properties it\n instantiates.[4]\n This assumption also allows a theory of natural properties and\nrelations to yield, in a fairly simple way, a definition of\n\u201cperfect duplicate\u201d applicable to any possible objects\nx and y (not necessarily inhabiting the same\npossible world): x and y are perfect duplicates iff\nthey share exactly the same perfectly natural\n properties.[5]\n A definition of \u201cintrinsic\u201d follows: a property\nP is intrinsic iff any two duplicates x and\ny (taken from any possible worlds) either both have\nP or both fail to have P. Of course, what we really\nhave here is a tight circle that puts on display how the expressions\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d, \u201cperfect duplicate\u201d, and\n\u201cperfectly natural\u201d can be interdefined, with the help of\nthe modal notion of metaphysical possibility. (See Lewis 1983c and\nLangton & Lewis 1998 for discussion of various strategies for\nbreaking out of this circle.)\n\nThe fourth constraint is purely negative: it is that it should be left\nto the empirical sciences to fill in the details about which\nperfectly natural monadic properties there are (at least, in\nactuality: philosophy might teach us, or at least give us\nsome reason to believe, that there are, in other possible worlds,\nso-called \u201calien\u201d properties, perfectly natural properties\nnot instantiated in the actual world). Not just any empirical science\nwill do: given, in particular, the first of the four theses, it is\nreally the job of fundamental physics to fill in these details. The\nspecial sciences get no say.\n\nWhat about perfectly natural relations? Here matters are less clear.\nLewis certainly thinks that spatiotemporal relations are perfectly\nnatural; what is less obvious is whether, by his lights, physics could\nrationally lead us to reject this claim. For now I will\nsimplify, and have Almost-Lewis add a fifth\nconstraint\u2014one that is in tension at least with the spirit of\nthe fourth, and that the real Lewis certainly rejects. It is this: not\nonly are spatiotemporal relations perfectly natural, they are the\nonly perfectly natural relations. (The only possible\nones\u2014though remember that given Lewis\u2019s reductionism about\nmodality, that is an idle addition.)\n\nThe picture that emerges is this: Reality consists of a multitude of\nspacetime points. Each of these stands in spatiotemporal relations to\nsome others (though not to all others). Each instantiates various\nperfectly natural, non-modal monadic properties. That is all there is;\nanything putatively \u201cextra\u201d\u2014facts about laws of\nnature, or about persisting macro-objects, or about causation, or\nabout mentality, or about ethics, or about sets, etc.\u2014must\nsomehow reduce to that stuff. For Almost-Lewis, this picture captures\na fundamental truth about the nature of existence. It is roughly right\nthat it is also a necessary truth\u2014a status that would\nseem to fall out automatically, given Lewis\u2019s reductionist account\nof modality. The only unfinished philosophical business is to\nwork out the right theory of natural properties and relations, and to\nwork out the details of the reduction for particular cases.\n4. Spatiotemporal relations and spacetime points\n\nThe foregoing Almost-Lewisian thesis about spatiotemporal relations is\ntoo strong to be tenable: we now have reasonably good reasons, drawn\nfrom quantum physics, for holding that even in the actual world, there\nare perfectly natural relations other than the purely spatiotemporal\nones. (Roughly: the relations\u2014whatever exactly they amount\nto\u2014coded up in the quantum mechanical wave-function.) Two points\nin its defense are, however, worth brief mention: First, seemingly\nobvious counterexamples\u2014involving such basic physical relations\nas being more massive than\u2014in fact aren\u2019t\ncounterexamples, since Lewis can deny that they are genuinely\nfundamental or perfectly natural, on the basis that facts\nabout their obtaining reduce to facts about the distribution of\nmonadic perfectly natural properties. (Still, they will certainly turn\nout to be very natural.) Second, if we could at least\nmaintain, as a contingent thesis, that the only perfectly\nnatural relations are spatiotemporal ones, then we could plausibly\nsettle an unresolved and deeply vexed question about the content of\nphysicalism (the doctrine, to put it rather too crudely, that all\nthere is to the actual world is physical stuff), as explained in\nthe supplementary document\n\nPhysicalism\n\n\nAt any rate, the thesis that spatiotemporal relations are at least\namong the perfectly natural relations allows us to clarify\nand simplify Almost-Lewis\u2019s position. Specifically, we can say\nthat all that it comes to to say that the fundamental entities are\nspacetime points is that they stand in perfectly natural\nspatiotemporal relations to one another. For more, see the\nsupplementary document on\n\nSpacetime Points\n\n\nTo say that they are spacetime points, finally, is to say\nthat they have no proper parts.\n\nOne upshot is that my original statement of Almost-Lewis\u2019s\nontology needs an amendment: for it was misleading to say that\naccording to him, the fundamental particulars are spacetime\npoints. That\u2019s true, but it wrongly suggests that he is making a\nchoice of one fundamental kind of particular, distinguished\nfrom other possible choices by the essential nature of its members.\nNot so. It is more accurate to describe his fundamental ontology\nthus:\n\nThere are particulars.\nThey are, or are wholly composed of,\nsimples\u2014particulars have no other particulars as proper\nparts.\nThese simples have various perfectly natural monadic\nproperties.\nThey stand in various spatiotemporal relations to one\nanother.\nAnd that is all.\n\n5. Humean Supervenience\n\nAlmost-Lewis\u2019s theses about what fundamental ontology comprises,\nand how all other facts reduce to facts about it, bears a very close\nrelationship to Lewis\u2019s celebrated thesis of Humean Supervenience\n(hereafter: \u201cHS\u201d). But they are not the same, and the\ndifferences are worth keeping track of. Here is a typical statement of\nHS (slightly stronger, as we\u2019ll see, than the version Lewis\nofficially endorses): No two possible worlds differ with respect to\nwhat is true at them, without differing with respect to the\ngeometrical arrangement of their spacetime points, or with respect to\nwhich perfectly natural properties are instantiated at those\n points.[6]\n (Note that so stated, HS is automatically metaphysically\nnecessary.) Thus, HS is a supervenience claim,\nlogically weaker than Almost-Lewis\u2019s claim of reduction. It is\nalso a claim that\u2014for some good reasons and some bad\nreasons\u2014Lewis accepts only in a weaker form that is\nmetaphysically contingent. More significantly, it is no part\nof HS that facts about possible worlds themselves reduce to\nanything else; whereas both Almost-Lewis and Lewis are explicit in\ntheir commitment to this further claim. Having said all this, it will\nbe worth remembering in what follows that Almost-Lewis\u2019s position\n(which, remember, incorporates Lewis\u2019s modal realism)\nentails HS. So, any doubts about HS will carry over to\nAlmost-Lewis\u2019s fundamental ontology.\n6. Lewis v. Almost-Lewis\n\nLet\u2019s consider now the most salient ways in which Lewis\u2019s own\npositions about fundamental ontology diverge from those of\nAlmost-Lewis.\n\nFirst, Lewis takes the lessons quantum physics teaches seriously\nenough to withhold endorsement of Almost-Lewis\u2019s fifth thesis,\nthat the only perfectly natural relations are spatiotemporal\nrelations.\n\nSecond, Lewis is agnostic as to whether, in addition to spacetime\npoints, there might be (in this, or other possible worlds) fundamental\nentities that are occupants of such points. But agnosticism\non this score is probably a bad idea: the proposed possibility is not\nclearly intelligible, nor it is clear what its motivation could be.\nFor more, see the supplementary document on\n\nSpacetime Points\n\n\nThird, on a plausible story about what non\u00ad-fundamental\nentities there are, it will turn out that on Almost-Lewis\u2019s view,\neverything that exists is composed of simples (parts, that themselves\nhave no proper parts). Lewis is also agnostic on this score: he takes\nit to be at least an epistemic possibility that there is\n\u201cgunk\u201d: something, every proper part of which itself has a\nproper part (see for example Lewis 1991). Lewis says relatively little\neither about the status of this possibility (in particular, is it more\nthan merely epistemic?), or about its potential ramifications for his\nvarious positions in metaphysics. To keep things simple, I will\ndiscount it for the remainder of this main essay.\n\nFourth, Lewis holds that his thesis of Humean Supervenience is, at\nbest, only contingently true. Of course, given that he\nrecognizes the (metaphysical) possibility of perfectly natural,\nnon-spatiotemporal relations, he should treat HS as at best\ncontingent. But he advances reasons for doing so of a quite different\nsort. They are not particularly good reasons, and so we will pass them\nby; but see the supplementary document on\n\nThe Contingency of Humean Supervenience\n\n\nfor discussion.\n7. Some criticisms\n\nWhat, finally, should we make of Lewis\u2019s conception of fundamental\nontology? A complicated question; I will limit discussion to just two\nimportant worries. Let\u2019s begin by noting the obvious influence of\na certain scientifically-informed conception of the world in shaping\nLewis\u2019s picture of reality. Lewis himself is quite explicit about\nthis influence:\n\nThe picture is inspired by classical physics. Humean Supervenience\ndoesn\u2019t actually say that physics is right about what local\nqualities there are, but that\u2019s the case to keep in mind. But if\nwe keep physics in mind, we\u2019d better remember that physics\nisn\u2019t really classical. \u2026The point of defending Humean\nSupervenience is not to support reactionary physics, but rather to\nresist philosophical arguments that there are more things in heaven\nand earth than physics has dreamt of. (1994, p. 474)\n\n\nBut there is a less acknowledged influence of first-order predicate\nlogic\u2014an influence that is not entirely salutary. It is\nundoubtedly tempting, for philosophers steeped in the use of\nfirst-order logic as a clarifying tool, to assume that the proper\nrepresentation of the ultimate structure of reality must be by means\nof some (interpreted) first-order language\u2014a language whose\nvarious predicates could be taken to express the various\nfundamental properties and relations that characterize\nreality at its most basic level. But if we look to physics\ninstead\u2014as we surely ought to\u2014we find that the basic\nrepresentational tools are variables, that correspond to\nphysical magnitudes. Taking seriously the picture of\nfundamental ontology suggested by these representations turns out to\nmatter quite a bit: in particular, there are reasons to think that\nnone of the first three theses about natural properties and\nrelations\u2014that they are minimal, non-modal, and\nintrinsic\u2014is tenable without some modification. This\nissue\u2014which we will mostly pass over in what follows, except\nwhere it matters\u2014is explored in more detail in the\nsupplementary document on\n\nPhysical Magnitudes\n\n\nThe second significant source of concern about Lewis\u2019s conception\nof fundamental ontology is the role\u2014or rather lack\nthereof\u2014that modal notions have in it. This concern has\ntwo aspects. First, one might hold that some, at least, of the\nfundamental properties and relations that characterize reality have\nmodal aspects that are ontologically basic. Consider mass:\none might hold that it is metaphysically impossible for there to be a\nworld containing just two massive particles, accelerating away from\neach other\u2014and that this impossibility somehow flows from the\nnature of mass itself.\n\nSecond, one might hold that it is one thing to state a thesis\nconcerning what the fundamental structure of reality in fact\nhappens to be; but that it is another, separate matter to\nstate how reality could be. Indeed, most metaphysicians, I\nsuspect, take it to be just blindingly obvious that these are\nconceptually distinct tasks. Granted that one\u2019s views on what\nthere is, and what it is like, will have ramifications for one\u2019s\nviews on what there could be and what it could be\nlike (most obviously, because things could be the way they\nare; but there may be more interesting and subtle connections\nas well); still, the project of laying out the former views does not\nautomatically complete the project of laying out the\nlatter.\n\nOf course there is a sense in which Lewis agrees: he takes it as\nobvious, after all, that he must supply an account of modality. But\nthe strikingly reductionist character of that account shows that such\nagreement as there is is mighty thin.\n8. Counterpart theory\nSo far, this entry focused on the general shape of Lewis\u2019s\nmetaphysics. In this section, we turn to one of Lewis\u2019s more specific\nmetaphysical doctrines: counterpart theory. We will begin with an\noverview of the theory, review its motivation, some applications, and\nthen turn to criticism and objections. In a supplementary document, we\nreview \n Counterpart-theoretic Semantics for Quantified Modal Logic.\n\nCounterpart theory was originally introduced in Lewis (1968) as a\nformal theory about possible worlds and their inhabitants, but the\nlabel quickly came to be used for a loosely defined approach towards\ntrans-world identity and the interpretation of modal or temporal\ndiscourse. For the modal case, the central idea is that a de\nre modal claim like \u2018Joe Biden might be immaterial\u2019\nis understood as saying that at some possible world, someone who\nsufficiently resembles Joe Biden in certain\nrespects\u2014a counterpart of Biden\u2014is\nimmaterial. Accordingly, \u2018Biden is necessarily material\u2019\nis understood as saying that all of Biden\u2019s counterparts at all\nworlds are material.\n\nWhile counterpart theory was Lewis\u2019s invention, it was also a\nproduct of its time, the 1960\u2019s, when quantified modal logic was\n\u201cin the air\u201d and questions about essentialism and the\nso-called problem of\n transworld identity\n gained attention (e.g.  Quine 1953, Hintikka\n 1962).[7]\n The counterpart-theoretic approach does, however, bear a striking\nsimilarity to certain views of Leibniz concerning essential and\naccidental\n properties.[8]\n (See Mondadori (1973) for a counterpart-theoretic interpretation of\nLeibniz.)\n8.1 Motivation and applications\n\nLewis assumed that modal statements in ordinary language can be\nanalysed in terms of quantification over possible worlds and\nindividuals: \u2018it is possible that there are talking\ndonkeys\u2019 is analysed as \u2018there are possible worlds at\nwhich there are talking donkeys\u2019.  Lewis\u2019s modal realism\npromises to turn this into a reductive analysis of\nmodality. Statements about what is or is not the case at some possible\nworld are ultimately reduced to non-modal statements.  That there is a\nworld with talking donkeys, for example, means that there is a\nspatiotemporally isolated aggregate of things that has a genuine\ntalking donkey as part.\n\nA problem now arises for de re statements about what is\npossible or necessary for a particular individual. Since Joe Biden\nmight have had three arms, there should be a world where he has three\narms. But if Biden were part of another world, then that\nworld and our world would have a part in common. Lewis denies that\ndifferent worlds can share parts. Even if we allowed for overlapping\nworlds, it is hard to see how the other world could have a three-armed\nBiden as a part, given that this part is also part of our world, where\nBiden has two arms (compare Lewis 1986e, 199ff.). So \u2018Biden\nmight have had three arms\u2019 is not analysed as stating that there\nis a world which contains a three-armed Biden as part. Rather, it says\nthat there is a world that contains a three-armed\nrepresentative or counterpart of Joe Biden.\n\nWhat makes one object a counterpart of another? According to Lewis,\nthis is a matter of qualitative similarity in certain respects: a\ncounterpart of Biden is an individual that sufficiently resembles the\nactual Biden in relevant respects, and more so than any other object\nin its world. Sometimes Lewis drops the second clause (e.g. Lewis\n1968, 114\u2013115), and at one point he merely suggests (without\nexplanation) that counterparthood \u201cusually involve[s]\nsimilarity\u201d (Lewis 1986e, 8).\n\nThe relevant respects of resemblance need not match intuitive\njudgements of overall similarity (Lewis 1986e, 254f.), and they can be\nhighly extrinsic. For example, they might give high weight to\nsomeone\u2019s origin (Lewis 1986e, 244f. and 252), or to a causal\nconnection to an epistemic subject (Lewis 1983e).\n\nLewis does not think there is a once-and-for all correct answer to\nwhich respects of resemblance are relevant. He rejects the idea that\nthings have primitive essences which somehow determine or constrain\nwhat is possible for them. Rather, it is ultimately up to us which\nrespects of similarity we prioritize. Often this choice is not fully\nsettled, leaving the counterpart relation vague and context-sensitive\n(see Lewis 1971, 209\u201311; Lewis 1973b, 41; Lewis 1983d, 42\u20133;\nLewis 1986e, 251\u20135; Lewis 2003, 27\u20138).\n\nFor example, Lewis suggests that when we talk about people, we often\nrequire the counterparts to have a very similar origin, while allowing\nfor different careers and lifespan. In such a context, we might judge\nthat Biden might have died as an infant. In other contexts, however,\nwe may wonder what would have been the case if Biden had been born to\ndifferent parents, relaxing the requirement of similar origin (see\ne.g., Lewis 1973b, 41).\n\nSince the counterpart relation is determined by similarity, everything\nis its own counterpart. Other than that, Lewis imposes few general\nrestrictions on the counterpart relation. In Lewis (1968), he suggests\nthat nothing can be a counterpart of a different object in the same\nworld, but this assumption is later dropped (Lewis 1986e, 232,\nfn.22). Unlike strict trans-world identity, counterparthood is not\nassumed to be transitive, symmetric, or functional. An object can have\nmultiple counterparts at a world, and different objects can have a\ncommon counterpart.\n\nLewis delivered counterpart theory as part of his modal realism, but\nthe core idea can be separated from this background, and even from the\nassumption of world-bound agents. (See e.g. Stalnaker 1986,\nHeller 1998, Sider 2002, Wang 2015, Woodward 2017; also Lewis 1986e,\n237f. and 259f.) Many philosophers who reject modal realism have come\nto appreciate counterpart theory because of its explanatory and\npuzzle-solving power. We will give a few examples.\n\nFirst, counterpart theory promises to explain the widespread\nelusiveness and context-dependence of essentialist judgements (Lewis\n1983d, 42\u20133; Lewis 1986e, \u00a74.5; cf. Kaplan 1979,\n100\u20132). Could London have been located in Scotland? Could it have\nbeen founded in the 16th century? The answers aren\u2019t obvious.\nFor Lewis, this is not because we have imperfect access to\nLondon\u2019s true essence, but simply because we have not settled\nexactly which other-worldly cities should qualify as counterparts of\nLondon. A London counterpart is a city that sufficiently\nresembles London, but the relevant resemblance criteria are\noften vague and context-dependent.\n\nSecond, counterpart theory might offer an answer to certain puzzles\nabout identity. Is a statue identical to the piece of clay from which\nit is formed? Is a person identical to their body? Lewis says yes.\nHowever, intuitively persons and bodies, or statues and pieces of\nclay, seem to differ in their modal properties: the piece of clay\ncould survive squashing, the statue could not. According to Lewis, the\nexplanation is that when we refer to an object as a statue, we give\nmore weight to similarity with respect to shape than when we think of\nthe same object as a piece of clay (see Lewis 1971; Lewis 1986e,\n252ff.; Lewis 2003, 27\u20138; and Robinson 1982).\n\nIn this context, Lewis suggests that different ways of referring to an\nobject can \u201cevoke\u201d different similarity standards, and\nthereby different counterpart relations, even within a single context\n(cf. Lewis 1986e, 258ff; Lewis 2003). This idea also helps to\nmake sense of conditionals like \u2019If I were you, I\u2019d hate\nme\u2019, where \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 in the\nconsequent intuitively pick out different individuals in the imagined\nperson-swapping scenario, both of which somehow represent the speaker\n(see Lewis 1973b, 43; Kocurek 2018).\n\nThird, counterpart theory might offer an answer to puzzles involving\npossible fission or time-travel. These might be analysed as scenarios\nin which an individual has multiple counterparts relative to the same\ncounterpart relation. Lewis intuits that he \u201cmight have been\ntwins\u201d (Lewis 1973, 40\u20131), because the fetus from which he\ndeveloped might have undergone fission. (See also Schwarz 2014, Karmo\n1983.)\n\nFourth, counterpart theory offers a way to accept haecceitistic\nintuitions without subscribing to haecceitism. Lewis assumes that all\ntruths supervene on qualitative truths: no two worlds agree in all\nqualitative respects, while disagreeing with respect to who plays\nwhich roles. A world of two-way eternal recurrence might look like a\ncounterexample: intuitively, we could have lived in any of the epochs\nof such a world; these seem to be distinct possibilities, but they do\nnot correspond to any qualitative difference. Lewis suggests that the\ndifferent epochs really do represent different possibilities for us,\nbecause we have counterparts in each of them. Here, too, Lewis invokes\nmultiple counterparthood relative to the same counterpart relation.\n(See Lewis 1986e, 230\u20135.)\n\nFifth, the fact that the counterpart relation need not be an\nequivalence relation has also been used to diffuse certain puzzles.\nConsider an ordinary bicycle. Intuitively, such an object does not\nhave all its parts essentially: the bike could have had a different\nchain, for instance. On the other hand, arguably it could not have\nbeen composed of entirely different parts. A bike made of\nentirely different parts would have been a different bike. But this\ncreates a puzzle (see Chisholm 1967, Chandler 1976): if the bike had a\ndifferent chain, it would still be an ordinary bike that does not have\nall its parts essentially; it could have had a different saddle (say).\nIterating this line of thought, we can create a sequence that leads\nfrom the actual bike to a bike composed of entirely different parts.\nEach possible bike in the sequence could have been the next bike in\nthe sequence. But didn\u2019t we say that it is impossible that my\nbike is composed of entirely different parts? Counterpart theory\noffers a natural answer: a counterpart of a counterpart need not be a\ncounterpart (see Lewis 1968, 28f; Lewis 1986e, 243\u20136;\nRamachandran 2020).\nSo far, we have focused on metaphysical modality. The central idea\nof counterpart theory has also been applied to other intensional\nconstructions.\nFor example, Sider (1996, 2001) and Hawley (2001) argue for a\ntemporal application, on which \u2018Joe Biden won the election\u2019 is\nanalysed as saying that a past counterpart of Biden won the\nelection. The temporal counterpart relation is here assumed to relate\nshort-lived temporal \u201cstages\u201d (see Schwarz 2014 for an alternative),\nand is not a matter of qualitative similarity. As in the modal case,\nthis approach has been advertised as solving a range of puzzles, as\nwell as explaining the vagueness and context-dependence of temporal\njudgements. Williams (2008) considers adopting the same perspective on\nidentity across space.\nSeveral authors (including Lewis) have suggested applying\ncounterpart theory to epistemic modality. Consider the following\npuzzle from Ninan (2018). A lottery has only two tickets, one blue and\none red. The tickets are numbered 1 and 2, but we don\u2019t know\nwhich color goes with which number. We know that the blue ticket won,\nbut we don\u2019t know the number of the winning ticket.  So, ticket\n1 might be the winner, and likewise for ticket 2. Yet even though\none of them is the red ticket it doesn\u2019t seem to follow that the\nred ticket is such that it might be the winner. Ninan suggests that\ndiffering counterpart relations are evoked by different ways of\npicking out the tickets. (See also Lewis 1983e, Stalnaker 1986, Shaw\n2015, Rabern 2018, among others.)\nAn alternative to counterpart theory is to interpret terms for\nordinary individuals as denoting (partial) functions from worlds to\nindividuals, or aggregates of individuals at different worlds; a modal\npredication like \u2018Biden might have been three-armed\u2019 is then\ninterpreted as saying that the function assigned to \u2018Biden\u2019 has a\nthree-armed value for some world, or that the aggregate assigned to\n \u2018Biden\u2019 has a three-armed part located in some world. A temporal\nanalogue of this view (with aggregates) is Lewis\u2019s preferred account\nof temporal discourse. In Lewis (1986f, 244) he endorses a similar\nview for events\u2014but see Bernstein (2014), Kaiserman (2017), and\nMcDonnell (2016) for reasons to prefer a counterpart-theoretic\ntreatment.[9]\n\nThe counterpart-theoretic analysis is more flexible insofar as it\neasily allows for cases of multiple counterparts or asymmetric\ncounterparthood, which are difficult to model with trans-world\naggregates. Lewis argues that this added flexibility is more important\nin the modal case than in the temporal case (Lewis 1971, 209; Lewis\n1983d, 40\u20132; Lewis 1986e, 217\u201320).\n8.2 Reactions and criticisms\n\nSome early criticisms of counterpart theory seem to rest on\nmisunderstandings. For example, Plantinga (1974, 115f.) and Salmon\n(1981, 232\u201338) complain that according to Lewis, all things have all\ntheir properties essentially, since there is no world in which these\nvery things exist and have different properties. Kripke (1980)\nsimilarly complains that according to Lewis, when we say that Humphrey\nmight have won the election, we are \u201cnot talking about something\nthat might have happened to Humphrey, but to someone\nelse\u201d (45, fn. 13). In response, Lewis points out that\non his view it is indeed Humphrey himself who might have won, in\nvirtue of having a winning counterpart, cf. Lewis (1986e, 194\u20136,\n246; 1983d, 41\u20132). Properly understood, Lewis\u2019s analysis\ndoes not even deny that there are worlds at which Humphrey (himself)\nwon the election. What the analysis denies is only that there are\nother worlds that contain Humphrey himself as a (winning) part. (See\nalso Hazen 1979, 320\u20134.)\n\nOne possible limitation of Lewis\u2019s account is that his\ncounterpart relation is assumed to be a qualitative similarity\nrelation. Feldman (1971) points out that \u201cI could have been\nquite unlike what I in fact am\u201d is intuitively true, which seems\nto require having non-similar counterparts. Lewis responds that there\nare two similarity relations involved: at the relevant worlds, there\nis someone who is similar to me in some respect (perhaps with respect\nto origin), but dissimilar from me in other respects (see Lewis\n1983d, 43; Lewis 1986e, 230\u2013235). Heller (2005), Stalnaker\n(1986), and Fara (2009) offer further considerations against analysing\ncounterparthood in terms of qualitative similarity.\n\nAnother limitation of Lewis\u2019s original presentation is that it\ndoes not allow imposing constraints on the choice of counterparts for\ndifferent individuals. Suppose we hold that Elizabeth II is\nessentially the daughter of George VI, and suppose there are worlds at\nwhich both Elizabeth and George have multiple counterparts, perhaps in\ndifferent epochs of eternally recurring time. Some Elizabeth\ncounterpart will then not be the daughter of some George counterpart.\nBy Lewis\u2019s 1968 account, \u2018Elizabeth might not have been\nGeorge\u2019s daughter\u2019 then comes out true, contrary to our\nsupposition. This problem was raised in Hazen (1979). Hazen suggests a\nrevised analysis in terms of sets of counterpart functions. Lewis\n(1983d, 44\u20135) instead suggests that we should understand\n\u2018Elizabeth might not have been George\u2019s daughter\u2019 as\na de re claim about the pair (or fusion) of Elizabeth and George.\nHazen (2012) argues that neither proposal fully avoids the\nproblem.\n\nThe most common objection to counterpart theory is probably that it\ngives rise to a deviant and counter-intuitive modal logic. Lewis\n(1968) gives translation rules from the language of quantified modal\nlogic to an extensional first-order language. These translation rules\ninvalidate the \u201cnecessity of identity\u201d and the\n\u201cnecessity of distinctness\u201d, as well as familiar\nprinciples of modal logic such \u25a1(A \u2227 B) \u2192 \u25a1A.\nConversely, they do validate controversial principles such as the\nConverse Barcan Formula and the \u201cnecessity of existence\u201d.\nIt has also been argued that the rules can\u2019t be extended to a\nlanguage with a well-behaved \u2018actually\u2019 operator.\n\nWhether these are genuine problems is a matter of debate. In fact,\nauthors in mathematical logic have come to appreciate\ncounterpart-theoretic interpretations of modal logic as overcoming\ncertain problems of standard Kripke semantics. There are also ways of\nreformulating Lewis\u2019s translation rules so as to avoid the\nsupposedly problematic features. See the supplementary document:\n\nCounterpart-theoretic Semantics for Quantified Modal Logic\n\n\nfor further details.\n\nLewis himself had no interest in preserving traditional principles of\nmodal logic. He always remained skeptical about the prospects of\nformalising modal discourse with boxes and diamonds. (see\ne.g. Lewis 1983d, 45; Lewis 1986e, 12\u201313). He thus rejected\nthe presupposition in these objections, that \u201cthe language of\nboxes and diamonds affords a good regimentation of ordinary modal\nthought\u201d (Lewis 1986e, 12).\n",
