    "main_text": "\n\nTrust is important, but it is also dangerous. It is important because\nit allows us to depend on others\u2014for love, for advice, for help\nwith our plumbing, or what have you\u2014especially when we know that\nno outside force compels them to give us these things. But trust also\ninvolves the risk that people we trust will not pull through for us,\nfor if there were some guarantee they would pull through, then we\nwould have no need to trust\n them.[1]\n Trust is therefore dangerous. What we risk while trusting is the loss\nof valuable things that we entrust to others, including our\nself-respect perhaps, which can be shattered by the betrayal of our\ntrust.\n\nBecause trust is risky, the question of when it is warranted is of\nparticular importance. In this context, \u201cwarranted\u201d means\njustified or well-grounded meaning, respectively, that the trust is\nrational (e.g., it is based on good evidence) or that it successfully\ntargets a trustworthy person. If trust is warranted in these senses,\nthen the danger of it is either minimized as with justified trust or\neliminated altogether as with well-grounded trust. Leaving the danger\nof trust aside, one could also ask whether trust is warranted in the\nsense of being plausible. Trust may not be warranted in a particular\nsituation because it is simply not plausible; the conditions necessary\nfor it do not exist, as is the case when people feel only antagonism\ntoward one another. This entry on trust is framed as a response to the\ngeneral question of when trust is warranted, where\n\u201cwarranted\u201d is broadly construed to include\n\u201cjustified\u201d, \u201cwell-grounded\u201d and\n\u201cplausible\u201d.\n\nA complete philosophical answer to this question must explore the\nvarious philosophical dimensions of trust, including the conceptual\nnature of trust and trustworthiness, the epistemology of trust, the\nvalue of trust, and the kind of mental attitude trust is. To\nillustrate how each of these matters is relevant, note that trust is\nwarranted, that is,\n\nplausible, again, only if the conditions required for trust exist\n(e.g., some optimism about one another\u2019s ability). Knowing what\nthese conditions are requires understanding the nature of trust.\nwell-grounded, only if the trustee (the one trusted) is\ntrustworthy, which makes the nature of trustworthiness important in\ndetermining when trust is warranted.\njustified, sometimes when the trustee is not in fact trustworthy,\nwhich suggests that the epistemology of trust is relevant.\njustified, often because some value will emerge from the trust or\nbecause it is valuable in and of itself. Hence, the value of trust is\nimportant.\nplausible, only when it is possible for one to develop trust,\ngiven one\u2019s circumstances and the sort of mental attitude trust\nis. For instance, trust may not be the sort of attitude that one can\nwill oneself to have without any evidence of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness.\n\n\nThis piece explores these different philosophical issues about trust.\nIt deals predominantly with interpersonal trust, which arguably is the\ndominant paradigm of trust. Although some philosophers write about\ntrust that is not interpersonal, including trust in groups (Hawley\n2017), institutional trust (i.e., trust in institutions; see, e.g.,\nPotter 2002; Govier 1997; Townley and Garfield 2013), trust in\ngovernment (e.g., Hardin 2002; Budnik 2018) or science (e.g., Oreskes\n2019), self-trust (Govier 1993; Lehrer 1997; Foley 2001; McLeod 2002;\nGoering 2009; Jones 2012b; Potter 2013), and trust in robots (e.g.,\nCoeckelbergh 2012, Sullins 2020), most would agree that these forms of\n\u201ctrust\u201d are coherent only if they share important features\nof (i.e., can be modeled on) interpersonal trust. The assumption going\nforward therefore is that the dominant paradigm is interpersonal.\n\nIn addition, while this entry focuses mainly on trust and\ntrustworthiness, it also covers distrust (more so in this version than\nin previous versions). Distrust has received surprisingly little\nattention from philosophers, although it has recently become a topic\nof serious concern for some of them, particularly those who are\ninterested in the politics of trust and distrust in societies marked\nby oppression and privilege. Relevant issues include when distrust is\nwarranted by people who experience oppression and how misplaced\ndistrust (i.e., in the oppressed) can be overcome by people who are\nprivileged. This entry delves into these matters and also summarizes\nthe few theories that exist about the nature of distrust.\n",
