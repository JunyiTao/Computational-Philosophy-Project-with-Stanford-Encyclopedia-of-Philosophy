Such an approach may propose a hierarchy of\npropositional logics that are all decidable in polynomial time, with\nthis hierarchy being structured by the increasing computational\nresources required for the proofs in the various logics.\nD\u2019Agostino and Floridi (2009) carry out just such an analysis,\nwith their central claim being that this hierarchy may be used to\nrepresent the increasing levels of informativeness of propositional\ndeductive reasoning.\n\nGabbay\u2019s (1993, 1996) framework of labelled deductive\nsystems exemplifies the information as code approach in manner\nvery similar to the informationalised substructural logics of\n section 3.1.\n An item of data (note that Gabbay refers to both atomic and\nconditional information as data, in contrast to Dunn and\nSequoiah-Grayson in the section above) is given as a pair of the form\n\\(x : A\\), where \\(A\\) is a piece of declarative information, and\n\\(x\\) is a label for \\(A. x\\) is a representation of information that\nis needed operate on or alter the information encoded by \\(A\\).\nSuppose that we have also the data-pair \\(y : A \\rightarrow B\\). We\nmay apply \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), resulting in the data-pair \\(x + y : B\\) In\nthis case, a database is a configuration of labelled formulas, or\ndata-pairs (Gabbay 1993: 72). The labels and their corresponding\napplication operation are organised by an algebra, and the properties\nof this algebra will impose constraints on the applications operation.\nDifferent constraints, of \u201cmeta-conditions\u201d as Gabbay\ncalls them (Gabbay 1993: 77), will correspond to different logics. For\nexample, if we were to ignore the labels, then we would have classical\nlogic, if we were to accept only the derivations which used all of the\nlabelled assumptions, then we would have relevance logic, and if we\naccepted only the derivations which used the labelled assumptions\nexactly once, then we would have linear logic. Labels are behaving\nvery much like possible worlds here, and the short step from possible\nworlds to information states makes it obvious how it is that the\nmeta-conditions on labels may be captured by structural rules.\n\nArtemov\u2019s (2008) framework of justification logic\nshares many surface similarities with Gabbay\u2019s system of\nlabelled deduction. The logic is composed of justification\nassertions of the form \\(x : A\\), read as \\(x\\) is a\njustification for \\(A\\). Justifications themselves are evidential\nbases of varying sorts that will vary depending on the context. They\nmight be mathematical proofs, sets of causes or counterfactuals, or\nsomething else that fulfils the justificatory role. What it means for\n\\(x\\) to justify \\(A\\) is not analysed directly in justification\nlogic. Rather, attempts are made to characterise the justification\nrelation \\(x : A\\) itself, via various operations and their axioms.\nThe application operation, \u2018.\u2019 mimics the application\noperation \u2018+\u2019 from labelled deduction, or the fusion\n\u2018\\(\\otimes\\)\u2019 operation from categorial information\ntheory. In justification logic, the symbol \u2018+\u2019 is reserved\nfor the representation of joint evidence. Hence \u2018\\(x +\ny\\)\u2019 is read as \u2018the joint evidence of \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\)\u2019. Application and join are characterised in\njustification logic by the following axioms respectively:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{13} &x : (A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(y : A \\rightarrow(x{.}y) : B) \\\\\n \\tag{14} &x : A \\rightarrow(x + y) : A, \\text{ and } x : A \\rightarrow(y + x) : A \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe latter axiom characterises the monotonicity of joint evidential\nbases. Apart from the commutativity of +, the structural properties of\nthe justification operations are currently unexplored, although the\npotential for such an exploration is exciting. Justification logic is\nused to analyse notoriously difficult epistemic problems such as the\nGettier cases and more. If we take our epistemology to be\ninformationalised, then the constitution of evidential bases as\ninformation states places justification logics within the information\nas code approach in a straightforward manner. For further details, see\nArtemov and Fitting (2012).\n\nZalta\u2019s work on object theory (Zalta 1983, 1993) provides a\ndifferent way to analyse informational content\u2014understood as\npropositional content\u2014and its structure. Motivated by\nmetaphysical considerations, object theory starts by proposing a\ntheory of objects and relations (usually formulated in a second order\nquantified modal language). This theory can then be used to define and\ncharacterise states of affairs, propositions, situations, possible\nworlds, and other related notions. The resulting picture is one where\nall these things have internal structure, their algebraic properties\nare axiomatized, and one can therefore reason about them in a\nclassical proof-theoretical way.\n\nA philosophical point touched by this approach concerns the link\nbetween the propositional content (information) expressed by sentences\nand the idea of predication. Relevant to this entry is Zalta\u2019s\n(1993) development of a version of situation theory that follows this\napproach, and where a key element is the usage of two forms of\npredication. Briefly, the formula \u2018\\(Px\\)\u2019 corresponds to\nthe usual form of predication by exemplification (as in \u201cObama\nis American\u201d), while \u2018\\(xP\\)\u2019 corresponds to\npredication via encoding. Abstract objects are then defined\nto be (essentially) encodings of properties, in combinations which\nmight not even be made factual. These provisions enable the existence\nof information about abstract, possible, or fictional entities. For\ndetails on the tradition to which object theory belongs see Textor\n(2012), McGrath (2012), and King (2012).\n",
