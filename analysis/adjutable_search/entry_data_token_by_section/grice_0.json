    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nThe best known of the works published during Grice\u2019s lifetime\nwas his joint paper with Peter Strawson, \u201cIn Defense Of A\nDogma\u201d, a widely reprinted defense of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction against Quine\u2019s attack in \u201cTwo Dogmas Of\nEmpiricism\u201d. The best known of his ideas, that of a\nconversational implicature, first appeared in a 1961 paper \u201cThe\nCausal Theory Of Perception\u201d, but was a focus of the James\nLectures. In contrast to the slogan, \u201cmeaning is use\u201d,\noften associated (though perhaps inaccurately) with Wittgenstein,\nGrice distinguished those elements of language use which were due to\nmeaning from those which are due to other aspects. To illustrate, the\nsentence \u201cHe has not been convicted of a crime yet\u201d means\nthat the person being referred to has not yet been convicted of a\ncrime. But in many contexts, the speaker would be taken to imply that\nthe person had committed at least one crime and was likely to be\nconvicted in the future. In \u201cThe Causal Theory of\nPerception,\u201d Grice deploys the distinction against J. L.\nAustin\u2019s claim in Sense and Sensibilia that a sentence\nlike \u2018It looks to me as if I see something red\u2019 is only\ncorrectly used when someone (possibly the speaker) has reason to doubt\nor deny that the speaker actually sees something red. Austin\u2019s\ntarget is sense-datum theorists who attempt to introduce sense-data by\nappeal to such sentences. Grice argues convincingly that, while\nusing the sentence may typically imply the doubt-or-denial\ncondition, that implication is not part of the meaning of the\nsentence since the speaker can cancel the implication by adding\n\u2018I do not mean to imply that there is any reason to doubt or\ndeny that I see something red.\u2019 What the speaker means on such a\noccasion can be true even if the speaker is using the sentence in an\nusual way, and there is no reason to doubt or deny the speaker sees\nsomething red. \n\nThis distinction between meaning and use has found many applications\nin philosophy, linguistics and artificial intelligence. Both the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction, which relies on a conception of truth\nby virtue of meaning, and the idea of a conversational implicature\nrequire for their full philosophical development a theory of meaning.\nGrice provided the beginning of a theory of meaning starting with his\n1957 paper \u201cMeaning\u201d and elaborated in later papers (Grice\n1968, 1969, 1982). The basic idea was to distinguish two notions of\nmeaning: what a sentence means in general apart from any use of it,\nand what a specific speaker means by using the sentence on a\nparticular occasion. Grice sees the latter notion as entirely a matter\nof what the speaker intends. Grice\u2019s idea was to show that the\nabstract notion of sentence meaning was to be understood in terms of\nwhat specific speakers intend on specific occasions.The following\nsections will outline the Grice-Strawson arguments for an\nanalytic-synthetic distinction (Section 2), notions of conversational\nimplicature (3), and then delve into his theories about meaning (4),\nreasoning (5), psychology (6), ontology (7), and value (8).\n",
