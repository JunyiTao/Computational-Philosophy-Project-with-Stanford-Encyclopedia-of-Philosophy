(The pluralist challenge)\n\nAn advantage of contractualism is that it can capture the wide range\nof considerations that are relevant to moral deliberation. All the\nconsiderations that provide individuals with reasonable grounds for\nobjecting to a proposed principle are relevant. As we saw in section\n3.2, these considerations include more than the direct (and even the\nindirect) impact of a proposed principle on individual well-being.\nThis plurality of considerations is nevertheless unified by a\nsingle normative domain or subject matter: unjustifiability.\n\nSome opponents of contractualism will object that contractualism is\nnot pluralist enough. They will object to the unified account of\nwrongness. Is it plausible that all the considerations relevant to\nwhat we owe to each other are unified by their relevance to whether\nthe principle permitting the conduct could be reasonably rejected? In\nour moral deliberation about right and wrong actions, are all moral\nconsiderations only relevant in virtue of how they affect whether or\nnot a principle licensing the proposed action is justifiable?\n\nTake for example, the claim that it is wrong to inflict gratuitous\nsuffering on persons, and sentient beings in general. Imagine someone\ntorturing someone else. A utilitarian will object that, in our grasp\nof the wrongness of the action, the most salient fact is that the\nbehaviour would inflict gratuitous suffering. This is much more\nsalient than the fact that the person could reasonably reject a\nprinciple permitting such conduct. The utilitarian concludes that\nmorality is fundamentally about the avoidance of suffering. A\npluralist will conclude instead that morality is irreducibly\nplural\u2014some moral reasons are grounded on justifiability, but\nothers are grounded directly on suffering or pleasure.\n\nThe contractualist replies that what is most morally relevant in the\ncase of torture is that suffering is brought about through the\nagency of another\u2014not just that suffering occurs. This is\nwhy being tortured is morally much worse than suffering similar\ninjuries through a lightning strike\u2014the former is an affront to\nmy human dignity in a way that the latter is not. If we agree that\nthis is the really significant fact, then the advantage now lies with\nthe contractualist, whose moral theory explicitly gives a central\nplace to the notion of agency. (As ever, the dialectic can continue,\nas utilitarians can reply that torture is morally worse than a\nlightning strike because it involves a gross failure of benevolence).\nFor a foundational consequentialist account of morality (such as\nutilitarianism), the wrongness of the action is based solely and\ndirectly on the suffering it would cause. Against such an account, the\ncontractualist argues that the moral importance of promoting\nwell-being is always mediated via its effect on the justifiability of\nthe relevant principle: if an action fails to show sufficient concern\nfor someone\u2019s well-being then that person has strong grounds for\nobjecting to the principle.\n\nIt is, furthermore, important to recall that contractualism deals in\n\u2018could reasonably reject\u2019 not in \u2018does\nreject\u2019. Contractualism does not say that gratuitously causing\nsuffering is not wrong until someone objects to it, or that\ngratuitously causing suffering would not be wrong at all if\nno-one happened to object to it. There is nothing accidental about the\nfact that a particular act of gratuitously causing suffering is wrong.\nRather, gratuitously causing suffering is always intrinsically\nwrong\u2014because it is (always and everywhere) the kind of thing\nthat provides grounds for reasonable rejection.\n\nContractualism and consequentialism thus gloss what is objectionable\nabout the same conduct in different ways. Instead of a decisive\nintuition that counts against contractualism, we have a case of\ndistinctive intuitions, where different theorists, beginning from\ndifferent intuitive starting points, end up with different theoretical\npriorities.\n\n",
