The Rise of the Sovereign State: Theory and Practice\n\nSupreme authority with a territory \u2014 within this definition,\nsovereignty can then be understood more precisely only through its\nhistory. This history can be told as one of two broad movements\n\u2014 the first, a centuries long evolution towards a European\ncontinent, then a globe, of sovereign states, the second, a\ncircumscription of absolute sovereign prerogatives in the second half\nof the twentieth century.\n\nIt was at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that Europe consolidated its\nlong transition from the Middle Ages to a world of sovereign states.\nAccording to historian J.R. Strayer, Britain and France looked a lot\nlike sovereign states by around 1300, their kings possessing supremacy\nwithin bounded territories. But as late as the beginning of the\nReformation in 1517, Europe remained distant from Westphalia. It was\njust around then that a great reversal in historical momentum occurred\nwhen Charles V of Spain ascended to the throne, uniting Castile,\nAragon and the Netherlands, at the same time becoming Holy Roman\nEmperor, gaining prerogatives over lands in Central Europe, while\ntaking on the role of enforcer of the Catholic Church\u2019s still\nsignificant temporal prerogatives inside the Empire, especially its\nenforcement of ecclesiastical orthodoxy. But within the Empire,\nCharles V was not sovereign, either, for princes and nobles there\nretained prerogatives over which he exercised no control. In 1555, a\nsystem of sovereign states gained important ground in the Peace of\nAugsburg, whose formula cuius regio, eius religio, allowed\nGerman princes to enforce their own faith within their territory. But\nAugsburg was unstable. Manifold contests over the settlement\u2019s\nprovisions resulted in constant wars, culminating finally in the\nThirty Years War, which did not end until 1648, at the Peace of\nWestphalia.\n\nWhat features of Westphalia make it the origin of the sovereign states\nsystem? In fact, not all scholars agree that it deserves this status\n(see Krasner 1999). Nowhere in the settlement\u2019s treaties is a\nsovereign states system or even the state as the reigning legitimate\nunit, prescribed. Certainly, Westphalia did not create a sovereign\nstates system ex nihilo, for components of the system had\nbeen accumulating for centuries up to the settlement; afterwards, some\nmedieval anomalies persisted. In two broad respects, though, in both\nlegal prerogatives and practical powers, the system of sovereign\nstates triumphed. First, states emerged as virtually the sole form of\nsubstantive constitutional authority in Europe, their authority no\nlonger seriously challenged by the Holy Roman Empire. The Netherlands\nand Switzerland gained uncontested sovereignty, the German states of\nthe Holy Roman Empire accrued the right to ally outside the empire,\nwhile both the diplomatic communications and foreign policy designs of\ncontemporary great powers revealed a common understanding of a system\nof sovereign states. The temporal powers of the Church were also\ncurtailed to the point that they no longer challenged any\nstate\u2019s sovereignty. In reaction, Pope Innocent X condemned the\ntreaties of the peace as \u201cnull, void, invalid, iniquitous,\nunjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for\nall time\u201d (quoted in Maland 1966, 16).\n\nSecond, Westphalia brought an end to a long era of intervention in\nmatters of religion, up to then the most commonly practiced abridgment\nof sovereign prerogatives. After decades of armed contestation, the\ndesign of the Peace of Augsburg was finally consolidated, not in the\nexact form of 1555, but effectively establishing the authority of\nprinces and kings over religion. Although intervention in matters of\nreligion did not come to an absolute end, it became exceedingly rare,\nthis in stark contrast to the previous 130 years, when wars of\nreligion sundered Europe. As the sovereign states system became more\ngeneralized in ensuing decades, this proscription of intervention\nwould become more generalized, too, evolving into a foundational norm\nof the international system.\n\nAgain, not all scholars agree that Westphalia deserves its\n\u2018founding moment\u2019 status. Daniel Philpott has argued for\nthe orthodoxy in (Philpott, 2001). In recent years, though a number of\nscholars have come to argue that the Westphalia myth ought to be\ndeconstructed and discarded (Krasner, 1999; Carvalho, Leira, and\nHobson, 2011; Nexon, 2009; Osiander, 1994; Osiander, 2001; Teschke,\n2009). Generally, these scholars stress that important elements of\nstatehood were around long before Westphalia and that important\nelements of \u2018hierarchy\u2019, or circumscription of sovereignty\nfrom above, perdured long after Westphalia. Only the long-term\nconsensus of scholars can determine how Westphalia will continue to be\nregarded.\n\nWhether the sovereign states system was consolidated at Westphalia,\ntook full shape at a later time, or always remained heterodox, its\nbasic form nevertheless spread worldwide over the next three\ncenturies, culminating in the decline of the European colonial empires\nin the mid-20th century, when the state became the only\nform of polity ever to cover the entire land surface of the globe.\nToday, norms of sovereignty are enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations, whose article 2(4) prohibits attacks on \u201cpolitical\nindependence and territorial integrity,\u201d and whose Article 2(7)\nsharply restricts intervention.\n\nWhile the section that follows this one will detail the\ncircumscription of sovereignty following World War II, this broad\nhistorical trend should not obscure respects in which sovereignty has\npersisted and even resurged in recent years. In an important article,\ninternational relations scholar Roland Paris (2020) makes the case\nthat global politics is seeing the reemergence of pre-Westphalian\nnotions of sovereignty, including \u201cextralegal\u201d and\n\u201corganic\u201d versions, which contrast with Westphalian\nsovereignty and its norms of the legal equality of state and\nnon-interference in domestic affairs. Paris documents this reemergence\nin Russia under President Vladimir Putin, China under President Xi\nJinping, and the United States under President Donald Trump. \n\nAs the sovereign state was occupying the European continent, piece by\npiece, in early modern times, eventually forming the system that came\nto occupy the globe, contemporary political philosophers embraced this\nform of polity and described what made it legitimate. They were not\noriginators of the concept, for even during medieval times,\nphilosophers like Dante and Marsilius of Padua advocated a separation\nof temporal and religious powers that would be achieved through a\ntransfer of prerogatives into temporal ruler\u2019s hands. Then, in\nearly modern times, there were two roughly contemporary philosophers\nwho did not write explicitly or consciously of sovereignty, yet whose\nideas amounted in substance to important developments of the concept.\nMachiavelli observed the politics of city states in his Renaissance\nItaly and described what a prince had to do to promote a flourishing\nrepublic in terms that conferred on him supreme authority within his\nterritory. Manifestly, he was not to be bound by natural law, canon\nlaw, Gospel precepts, or any of the norms or authorities that\nobligated members of Christendom. Rather, he would have to be prepared\n\u201cnot to be good,\u201d and to be ready to perform evil, not\nbecause evil was no longer evil, but because it was sometimes\nnecessary to further an end that was central for Machiavelli, an end\nthat amounts to the unifying idea of his thought: the strength and\nwell-ordering of the state. The obligation of the prince was\nraison d\u2019\u00e9tat. He was supreme within the\nstate\u2019s territory and responsible for the well being of this\nsingular, unitary body.\n\nPurveying sovereignty from quite a different perspective was Martin\nLuther. His theology of the Reformation advocated stripping the\nCatholic Church of its many powers, not only its ecclesiastical\npowers, but powers that are, by any modern definition, temporal.\nLuther held that the Church should no longer be thought of as a\nvisible, hierarchical institution, but was rather the invisibly united\naggregate of local churches that adhered to right doctrine. Thus, the\nCatholic Church no longer legitimately held vast tracts of land that\nit taxed and defended, and whose justice it administered; it was no\nlonger legitimate for its bishops to hold temporal offices under\nprinces and kings; nor would the Pope be able to depose secular rulers\nthrough his power of excommunication; most importantly, the Holy Roman\nEmperor would no longer legitimately enforce Catholic uniformity. No\nlonger would the Church and those who acted in its name exercise\npolitical or economic authority. Who, then, would take up such\nrelinquished powers? Territorial princes. \u201cBy the destruction of\nthe independence of the Church and its hold on an extra-territorial\npublic opinion, the last obstacle to unity within the State was\nremoved,\u201d writes political philosopher J.N. Figgis (72). It was\nthis vision that triumphed at Westphalia.\n\nLuther\u2019s political theology explained all of this. He taught\nthat under God\u2019s authority, two orders with two forms of\ngovernment existed. \u201cThe realm of the spirit\u201d was the\norder in which Christ was related to the soul of the believer. The\nrealm of the world was the order of secular society, where civil\nauthorities ran governmental institutions through law and coercion.\nBoth realms furthered the good of believers, but in different senses;\nthey were to be separately organized. Leaders of the church would\nperform spiritual duties; princes, kings and magistrates would perform\ntemporal ones. Freed from the power of the pope and the Catholic\nChurch, having appropriated temporal powers within their realm,\nprinces were now effectively sovereign. In that era, princes even\nexercised considerable control over Protestant churches, often\nappointing their regional leaders, as described by the doctrine of\n\u201cErastianism.\u201d Though neither Luther nor other Protestant\nreformers discussed the doctrine of sovereignty in any detail, they\nprescribed for princes all of its substance. Again, Figgis:\n\nThe unity and universality and essential rightness of the sovereign\nterritorial State, and the denial of every extra-territorial or\nindependent communal form of life, are Luther\u2019s lasting\ncontribution to politics. (91)\n\n\nOther early modern philosophers, of course, espoused the doctrine of\nsovereignty explicitly, and are thus more familiarly associated with\nit. French philosopher Jean Bodin was the first European philosopher\nto treat the concept extensively. His concept of\nsouverainet\u00e9 featured as a central concept in his\nwork, De la r\u00e9publique, which he wrote in 1576, during\na time when France was sundered by civil war between Calvinist\nHuguenots and the Catholic monarchy. He viewed the problem of order as\ncentral and did not think that it could be solved through outdated\nmedieval notions of a segmented society, but only through a concept in\nwhich rulers and ruled were integrated into a single, unitary body\npolitic that was above any other human law, and was in fact the source\nof human law. This concept was sovereignty. Only a supreme authority\nwithin a territory could strengthen a fractured community.\n\nTo be sure, Bodin thought that the body that exercised sovereignty was\nbound by natural and divine law, though no human law could judge or\nappeal to it. More curiously, he also thought that sovereignty rightly\nexercised would respect customary and property rights. It is not clear\nhow such a restraint was to be reconciled with the supreme status of\nsovereign authority. Possibly, Bodin thought that such rights were to\nbe features of a legal regime which was itself sovereign with respect\nto other authorities. Indeed, he also thought the form of government\nthat exercised sovereign powers could legitimately vary among\nmonarchy, aristocracy and democracy, though he preferred monarchy.\nWhatever the sovereign body looked like, though, it was not subject to\nany external human law or authority within its territory. F.H. Hinsley\nwrites:\n\nAt a time when it had become imperative that the conflict between\nrulers and ruled should be terminated, [Bodin] realized \u2014 and it\nwas an impressive intellectual feat \u2014 that the conflict would be\nsolved only if it was possible both to establish the existence of a\nnecessarily unrestricted ruling power and to distinguish this power\nfrom an absolutism that was free to disregard all laws and\nregulations. He did this by founding both the legality of this power\nand the wisdom of observing the limitations which hedged its proper\nuse upon the nature of the body politic as a political society\ncomprising both ruler and ruled \u2014 and his statement of\nsovereignty was the necessary, only possible, result\n(124\u2013125).\n\nBodin\u2019s \u201cstatement of sovereignty\u201d is the first\nsystematic one in modern European philosophy, and thus deserves a\nlandmark status.\n\nThe English philosopher Thomas Hobbes also wrote during a time of\ncivil war and also arrived at the notion of sovereignty as a solution.\nFor Hobbes, the people established sovereign authority through a\ncontract in which they transferred all of their rights to the\nLeviathan, which represented the abstract notion of the state. The\nwill of the Leviathan reigned supreme and represented the will of all\nthose who had alienated their rights to it. Like Bodin\u2019s\nsovereign, Hobbes\u2019 Leviathan was above the law, a mortal god\nunbound by any constitution or contractual obligations with any\nexternal party. Like Bodin, Hobbes also thought the sovereign to be\naccountable to God and most likely to the natural law in some form.\nOtherwise, though, law was the command of the sovereign ruler,\nemanating from his will, and the obligation to obey it absolute.\n\nBoth Bodin and Hobbes argued for sovereignty as supreme authority. The\nconcept continues to prevail as the presumption of political rule in\nstates throughout the globe today, including ones where the sovereign\nbody of law institutes limited government and civil rights for\nindividuals. Over the centuries, new notions of the holders of\nsovereignty have evolved. Rousseau, far different from Bodin or\nHobbes, saw the collective people within a state as the sovereign,\nruling through their general will. In constitutional government, it is\nthe people ruling through a body of law that is sovereign. That is the\nversion that commands legitimacy most commonly in the world today.\n\nYet versions of sovereignty evocative of Hobbes\u2019 and\nBodin\u2019s have carried forth into the twentieth century.\nExplicitly invoking both of these philosophers was the early twentieth\ncentury German philosopher and jurist Carl Schmitt, for instance. His\nbook of 1922 opens with the line, \u201cSovereign is he who decides\non the exception\u201d (trans. G. Schwab, 1985). Schmitt thought that\nthe sovereign was above any constitutional law and ought to be able to\n\u201cmake a decision\u201d on behalf of the good of the state\nduring a time of emergency. He had little respect for liberal\nconstitutionalism, which he thought wholly inadequate to contain the\npower struggle that politics involves. By and large, there is little\nindicating that, at least in this work, Schmitt thought the sovereign\nto be bound by divine law or natural law. The liberal\nconstitutionalism of Weimar Germany was his chief piece of evidence\nfor this conviction; during the 1930s he fervently supported the\nNational Socialist regime, one whose emergency powers were just those\nthat he thought necessary.\n",
