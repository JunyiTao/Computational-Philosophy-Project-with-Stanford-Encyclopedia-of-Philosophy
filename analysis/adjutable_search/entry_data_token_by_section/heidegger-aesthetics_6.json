This subject/object dichotomy seems obvious\nwhen one is theorizing from within the modern tradition, in which it\nhas functioned as an axiom since Descartes famously argued that the\nsubject\u2019s access to its own thinking possesses an indubitable\nimmediacy not shared by our access to objects, which must thus be conceived of as\nexternal to subjectivity.\n\n\nYet, as Heidegger argues in Being and Time (1927), taking\nthis modern subject/object dichotomy as our point of departure leads us\nto fundamentally mischaracterize the way we experience the everyday\nworld in which we are usually unreflectively immersed, the world of our\npractical engagements. By failing to recognize and do justice to\nthe integral entwinement of self and world that is basic to our\nexperiential navigation of our lived environments, modern philosophy\neffectively splits the subject off from objects and from other\nsubjects. In this way, modern philosophy lays the conceptual\ngroundwork for subjectivism, the \u201cworldview\u201d in\nwhich an intrinsically-meaningless objective realm\n(\u201cnature\u201d) is separated epistemically from isolated,\nvalue-bestowing, self-certain subjects, and so needs to be mastered\nthrough the relentless epistemological, normative, and practical\nactivities of these subjects. Heidegger suggests that this\nproblem is not merely theoretical, because the subjectivism of the\nmodern worldview functions historically like a self-fulfilling\nprophecy. Its progressive historical realization generates not\nonly the political freedoms and scientific advances we cherish, but\nalso unwanted downstream consequences such as our escalating\nenvironmental crisis and less predictable side-effects like the\naestheticization of\n art.[21]\n",
