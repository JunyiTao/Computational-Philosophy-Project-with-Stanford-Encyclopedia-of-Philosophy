    "main_text": "Causalism and Causal Theories of Action\n2. Causalism and Causal Theories of Action\n\nPossibly the most widespread and accepted theory of intentional action\n(though by no means without its challengers) is the causal theory of\naction, a theory according to which something counts as an intentional\naction in virtue of its causal connection to certain mental states. In\nfact, this view is often dubbed (following Velleman 1992) the\n\u2018standard story of action\u2019. Although other philosophers\nproposed similar views before, the contemporary causal theory of\naction, or \u201ccausalism,\u201d was pioneered by Donald Davidson,\nespecially the essays collected in Davidson (2001a). Davidson has\ncontributed to many topics in the philosophy of action, such as action\nindividuation, the logical form of action sentences, the relation\nbetween intention and evaluative judgments, among others, but here we\nwill focus mostly on his arguments for, and his formulation of, the\ncausal theory of action. In Action, Reasons, and Causes\n(ARC), Davidson provides an account of the nature of rationalizing\nexplanations of actions, or what is often called \u2018intentional\nexplanations\u2019. Such explanations explain the action by providing\nthe reason why the agent acted. ARC tries to understand how a reason\ncan explain an action. The two central theses of ARC, or modified\nversions of them, became subsequently widely, though certainly not\nuniversally, accepted. The first thesis is that the explanation of an\naction involves a \u201cprimary reason\u201d: a belief and a desire\npair that rationalizes the action by expressing the end pursued in the\naction (desire) and how the agent thought the action would accomplish\nthis end (instrumental belief). So, for instance, in \u201cLarry went\nto Gus the Barber because he wanted a haircut\u201d, Larry\u2019s\naction is explained by a desire (his wanting a haircut) and a belief,\nleft implicit in this case (his believing that he could get a haircut\nby going to Gus the Barber). The second central thesis is that the\nprimary reason is also the cause of the action.\n",
