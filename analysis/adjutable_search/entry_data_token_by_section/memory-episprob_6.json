    "main_text": "Memory and Justification || Time-slice and Historical Theories\n2.3 Time-slice and Historical Theories\n\nThe problems of forgotten evidence and forgotten defeat have to do\nwith the justification a subject has at one time, given what the\nsubject has forgotten since an earlier time. If these problems\naren\u2019t just superficial, the subject\u2019s past matters for\nher present justification in a nontrivial way. A trivial way\nthat it could matter is as follows: a subject had some justifying\nevidence at an earlier time, and her memory causes her to have this\nevidence now, and this evidence justifies her beliefs now. There is a\ntrivial connection here between the subject\u2019s present\njustification and her past, in that the subject\u2019s past only\nindirectly affects her present justification. It affects her present\njustification just by affecting what evidence she has in the present.\nBut ultimately it is just her evidence now that determines what\njustification she has now.\n\nIn short, some of the problems above draw attention to how a state of\naffairs at a time might directly matter for justification at another\ntime. If a subject can have justification for believing that\np now even if she has forgotten her original evidence for\np and has no other support for p now, it appears her\npast can directly affect her present justification. It is because she\nhad justification or justifying evidence that she\nhas justification. Similarly, if a subject who seems to\nrecall that p can fail to have justification for believing\nthat p now because she has forgotten a defeater for\np, her past seems to directly affect her present\njustification.\n\nIt is not obvious just how time and justification connect, and the\nrole memory plays in this connection. The basic options are few. Here\nare some: it could be that all that directly matters for justification\nat a time is how things are at that time. Call a theory that implies\nthis a time-slice theory of justification. Or, it could be\nthat past states of affairs also directly matter for justification at\nthat time. Call a theory that implies this a historical\ntheory of justification. (See Kelly 2016 and Moss 2015 for further\ndiscussion). A less explored possibility is that future states of\naffairs directly matter for justification at a time\u2014but since\ntime-slice and historical theories are the two most popular\ncandidates, this entry focuses on them. To include memory in these\noptions, and to center on the present: perhaps memory affects a\nsubject\u2019s justification now only by way of how her memory\ncurrently is or is active\u2014for example what a subject now recalls\nor is disposed to recall or otherwise has tucked away in memory. Or,\nperhaps what was once a part of a subject\u2019s memory also matters\nfor her justification now even if it is not in her memory now. Or\nperhaps what she will later remember matters for her justification\nnow.\n\nNote that the time-slice and historical distinction crosscuts the\ninternalism and externalism distinction. Wherever a theory of\njustification lands in one distinction, it could land anywhere in the\nother. For example, an internalist theory of justification can state\nthat just the way a subject is now, including the way her memory is\nnow, directly matters for her justification now (Feldman & Conee\n2001). Or it could state that elements of her past, including its\ninfluence on a subject\u2019s memory, directly matter for her\njustification now (Huemer 1999; McGrath 2007, 2016). Some combinations\nare more common and perhaps more plausible than others. Internalists\nmore often favor time-slice views, while externalists more often favor\nhistorical views. Goldman\u2019s (2009) reliabilism is a paradigm\nexternalist, historical view: a memory belief\u2019s current\njustificatory status is chiefly a matter of memory preserving the\nbelief\u2019s past status, and that the past status is partially\ndetermined by factors external to the subject, such as the reliability\nof the process that originally formed the belief. An externalist\ntheory could be time-slice, but that is less common.\n\nTime-slice theories have some assets. For one, they are relatively\nsimple. On a time-slice theory, what explains a subject\u2019s\njustification at a time is just the way things are then. It is more\ncomplicated to identify the way things are at other times as also\nbeing relevant. Moreover, the way things are at a time might fully\nexplain a subject\u2019s justification then. For example, a\nsubject\u2019s recollective dispositions and what she seems to\nrecollect at a time might account for all her justification from\nmemory then. Appealing to the past seems unnecessary. And it\u2019s\nplausible that a simpler explanation, all else being equal, is better.\nSo time-slice theories, all else being equal, appear better than\nhistorical theories, since the latter cite the past as also directly\nmattering for a subject\u2019s present justification. Another asset\nof time-slice theories may be this. Two subjects can have different\npasts but be identical in the present. They at the moment have all the\nsame beliefs, memories, experiences, and so on. Because they are the\nsame now, it might seem that they are the same with respect to what\nthey are justified in believing, disbelieving, and suspending judgment\nin now. But if that\u2019s right, their differing pasts don\u2019t\nmatter (Moon 2012b). If the differences in their pasts don\u2019t\nmatter, it appears their pasts don\u2019t matter at all. And if\nsubject\u2019s past doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s hard to see what\nelse about the past could matter. Justification in the present is\nsettled just by how things are. Similarly, it might seem that a past\nthat a subject currently has no memory of shouldn\u2019t matter for\nher present justification (Feldman & Conee 2001).\n\nBut historical theories might have their own merits. For example, the\ncausal history of a belief appears relevant to its justification in\nthe present (Goldman 1979). It is not just the immediate cause of a\nbelief that counts. How a belief originated and has since been kept in\nmemory, and what justificatory status it has had along the way, might\nseem to directly bear on its justificatory status now. An historical\ntheory of justification can accommodate these intuitions, while a\ntime-slice theory must deny that the causal history of a belief\nmatters as such. For the time-slice theory, this history could matter\nfor justification in the present only indirectly, insofar as it\naffects the world in the present. The past, including past memory,\ndoesn\u2019t matter for justification, except insofar as it affects\nthe present, which does matter for justification.\n\nHistorical theories may have an easier time explaining how reasoning\nis able to provide justification. Most reasoning is temporally\nextended. It takes place over time. Burge (1993: 463) says that\n\u201cAny reasoning in time must rely on memory\u201d. To reason to\na supported conclusion, presumably all steps of reasoning along the\nway need to be supported too. Burge (2003: 300) thinks that it is\nmemory that holds any support for past steps constant during later\nsteps of the reasoning. When arriving at a supported conclusion, the\nsubject might not be thinking about evidence for the earlier steps in\nthe reasoning or doing anything else that would support these steps.\nThe subject must be inheriting support for these steps from the past\nvia memory. The subject\u2019s current step of reasoning\ncouldn\u2019t itself fully support the conclusion. We must cite the\nsupport that memory ushers in from the past for previous reasoning\nsteps.\n\nBuoying historical theories further, Kelly (2016) looks at a case of\nextended reasoning that involves a nontrivial error. At the end this\nreasoning the subject may end up mentally identical to a subject who\nreasoned without error. (The rest of the world at that time may be\nidentical too.) It\u2019s plausible that the subjects are unequal in\ntheir justification, since one of them reasoned erroneously and the\nother didn\u2019t. But because the subjects are identical mentally at\nthe later time, a time-slice theory must say the subjects are\nidentical in their justification then.\n\nAnnis (1980) thinks historical theories are better at accounting for\nthe justification that children have. A child\u2019s current mind may\nnot yet be sophisticated enough to explain how some of her current\njustified beliefs in memory are indeed justified. Rather, what\njustifies these beliefs now must be found in the past. Annis also\nargues time-slice theories flounder on the problems of forgotten\nevidence and forgotten defeat.\n\nOne historical theory of particular note is epistemic conservatism\n(Harman 1986; McCain 2008, 2019; McGrath 2007, 2016; Poston 2014).\nAccording to epistemic conservatism, a subject who believes a\nproposition has some prima facie reason to continue believing it.\nUnless a subject has reason to drop her belief, she has some\njustification for keeping it. This theory is historical because it\nsays having a belief at one time directly results in having\njustification for it later. Past believing matters for justification\nin the present. Notably, this theory is also friendly toward\ninternalism, and it is internalists rather than externalists who tend\nto be friendly toward it. It identifies elements of the past that\naffect the subject\u2019s present justification, but these elements\nare all mental, namely, the subject\u2019s past beliefs. McGrath\n(2007) brings epistemic conservatism to bear on a range of\nepistemological problems of memory. He (2007: 14) thinks it solves the\nproblem of forgotten evidence. A subject may have forgotten her\noriginal evidence for her belief that p, and yet it might be\nintuitive that this belief is still justified. Epistemic conservatism\ncan explain why: the subject had already believed that p, and\nthis past believing, in the absence of a defeater, is enough for her\nbelief to be justified now. McGrath (2007: 21) also thinks epistemic\nconservatism solves the problem of stored beliefs. A justified belief\nthat is stored in memory is presumably one that was believed a moment\nago too. Believing then explains why the belief is justified now.\n\nThis solution to the problem of stored beliefs faces challenges (Frise\n2017a). A subject, Ric, may have justified stored beliefs. An evil\ndemon could bring about another subject, Vic, who is mentally\nidentical to Ric. When Vic comes about, he too has stored beliefs. But\nhe had no beliefs prior to existing. Epistemic conservatism does not\nexplain how any of his stored beliefs could be justified at the moment\nof his creation. And there is reason to think some are justified\nthen\u2014Vic is Ric\u2019s mental twin, and Ric\u2019s has\njustified stored beliefs then. What\u2019s more, Vic might not change\nat all mentally from the moment of his creation to the next moment.\nBut because Vic has beliefs at this first moment, according to\nepistemic conservatism, he has prima facie justification for them at\nthe second moment. Epistemic conservatism explains the justification\nof his stored beliefs at the second time but not the first, even\nthough he is his own mental duplicate at these times.\n\nEpistemic conservatism may also solve the problem of forgotten defeat\n(McGrath 2016). When a subject has forgotten all defeaters, she has no\nreason to abandon belief. For her to change from believing to not\nbelieving for no reason looks unreasonable. Keeping the belief looks\nreasonable. Epistemic conservatism explains this, as it says in the\nabsence of defeat the past believing results in justification for\ncontinuing to believe. Beliefs in memory that aren\u2019t based on\nother beliefs are \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d (McGrath\n2016: 80).\n\nEpistemic conservatism and certain other historical theories may face\na problem specifically concerning memory. Suppose a subject\njustifiedly forms a belief that p. Later, she remembers that\np. The remembering might justify believing that p.\nBut historical theories like epistemic conservatism say that past\nbelieving or past justified believing confers justification via\nmemory. So it looks like the remembering subject now has two sources\nof justification for the belief that p: the remembering and\nthe past believing. If having these two sources increases\njustification, it appears that memory is boosting the\njustification. Remembering can ratchet up justification. But that\nseems incorrect (Bernecker 2008; Huemer 1999).\n\nThere may not be a boost in justification in this sort of case,\nhowever, but rather an overdetermination of belief (McGrath 2007).\nThere are two justifying causes for the belief. It doesn\u2019t\nfollow that the belief has more justification than if it had one\njustifying cause. One nuanced version of epistemic conservatism offers\nanother response. On it, belief that p confers justification\nfor continuing to believe that p only if the subject has no\nevidence for or against p (Poston 2014). If remembering that\np is evidence for p, then the past believing is not\njustifying the subject in continuing to believe that p. On\nthis response, then, the case of remembering while retaining past\nbelief involves only one source of justification. So there\u2019s no\nboost upon remembering.\n\nA variation of the boost objection is that a subject might retain her\noriginal justifying evidence for p, and might thanks to\nmemory believe that p. It might appear that on epistemic\nconservatism, the subject again has two sources of justification. But\nthe subject should not have any degree of justification beyond what\nthe original evidence confers. One reply to this boost objection is\nthat believing while retaining the original evidence here may not\nresult in a greater degree of justification, but simply result in\njustification that is more difficult to defeat (McGrath 2016: 81).\n\nThe most popular and influential historical theory of justification is\nprocess reliabilism. As noted, it links the justification of a belief\nwith the reliability of the process that yields the belief. One\nsufficient condition it states for justified belief puts memory and\nthe past in the forefront. A process that yields beliefs could have a\nrange of types of inputs. Some of these inputs could themselves be\nbeliefs. An inferential process, for example, takes beliefs as inputs\nand yields a belief. Reliabilism says that if these input beliefs are\njustified, and the process has a certain kind of reliability (namely,\nit tends to yield true belief when the belief inputs are true), then\nthe resulting belief is justified (Goldman 1979). This helps explain\nhow memory can justify, and how the past directly matters for present\njustification. Some memory processes are reliable in the relevant way.\nAnd a memory process can take a past justified belief that p\nas an input and yield belief that p as an output later.\n(Continuously believing that p via memory may be due to a\nmemory process feeding the belief that p into itself.) The\noutput belief is, according to reliabilism, therefore justified.\n\nReliabilism might solve several epistemological problems of memory\n(Goldman 2009, 2011; Senor 1993, 2010). Consider the problem of\nforgotten evidence. On reliabilism, forgetting the original evidence\nfor a belief need not compromise its justification. If the belief was\njustified and has been kept by a suitably reliable process, it is\njustified now. And consider the problem of stored beliefs. On\nreliabilism a belief that is stored in memory can be justified in the\nsame way as in cases of forgotten evidence, even if nothing in the\nsubject\u2019s current mental life is justifying evidence for the\nbelief. Finally, consider the problem of forgotten defeat. Suppose a\nsubject had a defeater that eliminated all her justification for a\nbelief. The belief that enters memory is unjustified. The belief may\nbe an input to a suitably reliable memory process, but because the\ninput belief itself is unjustified not all inputs to the process are\njustified. So even if the defeater is forgotten, reliabilism is not\nimplying here that the output of this memory process is justified; the\nsufficient condition for justification has not been met. Reliabilism\ncan deliver the result that there is no justification in a case of\nforgotten defeat, and maybe that result is correct. Reliabilism faces\nmany criticisms (BonJour 1980; Cohen 1984; Conee & Feldman 1998;\nFrise 2018d). But many think it fares well in the epistemology of\nmemory.\n",
