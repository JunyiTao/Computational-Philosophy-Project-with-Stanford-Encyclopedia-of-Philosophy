    "main_text": "Meritocratic Governance || Plural voting\n3.3 Plural voting\n\nPerhaps the most famous meritocratic proposal in the Western\nliterature is John Stuart Mill\u2019s (1859a, 1859b, 1861) plural\nvoting. Mill\u2019s proposal integrates his liberal desire for\nuniversal suffrage with an anti-egalitarian streak:\n\n\nIf it is asserted that all persons ought to be equal in every\ndescription of right recognised by society, I answer, not until all\nare equal in worth as human beings. It is the fact, that one person is\nnot as good as another; and it is reversing all the rules of\nrational conduct, to attempt to raise a political fabric on a\nsupposition which is at variance with fact. (1859b: 23)\n\n\n(Notice how similar this sentiment is to Mencius\u2019\n [\u00a71].)\n\nMill\u2019s proposal is simple: Everybody gets a vote (thereby\nsatisfying universal suffrage) and some people get more than one\n(because they are, in some sense, of greater \u201cworth\u201d).\nMill offers several justifications for plural voting (see Dale Miller\n2015), including\u2014unsurprisingly for the utilitarian\nMill\u2014that it will produce better political consequences.\n\nAn immediate challenge facing the plural voting proponent is how to\nspecify voting weights. Mill (1859b: 25\u201326) gives one potential\nspecification:\n\nUnskilled laborers: 1 vote\nSkilled laborers: 2 votes\nForemen and \u201csuperintendents of labor\u201d: 3 votes\nFarmers, manufacturers, and traders: 3\u20134 votes\nProfessionals (e.g., lawyers, doctors, clergymen, \u201cliterary\nmen\u201d, artists, \u201cpublic functionaries\u201d): 5\u20136\nvotes\nUniversity graduates and members of \u201clearned\nsocieties\u201d: At least as many votes as professionals.\n\n\nWhile this assignment has prima facie plausibility, Mill does\nnot provide a rigorous defense of it. It is surely sub-optimal (why 3\nvotes for foremen? Why not 2? Or 3.5?) And perhaps its prima\nfacie plausibility is misleading. Maybe professionals possess\nbiases which laborers do not, thereby making the former less likely\nthan the latter to vote well. (The same may be said of Harwood\u2019s\n[1998] proposal.)\n\nTo overcome this difficulty, Mulligan (2018c) advances a statistical\napproach to plural voting which attempts to rigorously derive optimal\nvoting weights from voting history. And Trevor Latimer\u2019s (2018)\n\u201cegalitarian\u201d plural voting proceeds in two stages: The\nfirst operates under \u201cone person, one vote\u201d and determines\nvoting weights; the second determines the substantive political\nquestion using those (generally unequal) weights.\n\nTwo technical notes: First, some forms of plural voting may de\nfacto restrict the suffrage. For example, suppose that there are\nfour voters. Voters A, B, and C have 2\nvotes each. Voter D has 1 vote. There are no voter coalitions\nin which D\u2019s vote affects the result. He is effectively\ndisenfranchised. The flip-side of this is that plural voting is\ncompatible with democrats\u2019 treasured \u201cone person, one\nvote\u201d principle: If voters are equally competent, a plural\nvoting system will grant them an equal number of votes.\n\nSecond, there is no unique assignment of voting weights. For example,\nall weights in Mill\u2019s system may be multiplied by 2, with the\nsame results.\n",
