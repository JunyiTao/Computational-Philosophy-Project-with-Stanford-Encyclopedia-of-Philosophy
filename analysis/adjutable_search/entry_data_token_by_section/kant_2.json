    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s project in the Critique of Pure Reason || The crisis of the Enlightenment\n2.1 The crisis of the Enlightenment\n\nTo understand the project of the Critique better, let us\nconsider the historical and intellectual context in which it was\n written.[5]\n Kant wrote the Critique toward the end of the Enlightenment,\nwhich was then in a state of crisis. Hindsight enables us to see that\nthe 1780\u2019s was a transitional decade in which the cultural\nbalance shifted decisively away from the Enlightenment toward\nRomanticism, but Kant did not have the benefit of such hindsight.\n\nThe Enlightenment was a reaction to the rise and successes of modern\nscience in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The spectacular\nachievements of Newton in particular engendered widespread confidence\nand optimism about the power of human reason to control nature and to\nimprove human life. One effect of this new confidence in reason was\nthat traditional authorities were increasingly questioned. Why should\nwe need political or religious authorities to tell us how to live or\nwhat to believe, if each of us has the capacity to figure these things\nout for ourselves? Kant expresses this Enlightenment commitment to the\nsovereignty of reason in the Critique:\n\nOur age is the age of criticism, to which everything must submit.\nReligion through its holiness and legislation through its majesty\ncommonly seek to exempt themselves from it. But in this way they\nexcite a just suspicion against themselves, and cannot lay claim to\nthat unfeigned respect that reason grants only to that which has been\nable to withstand its free and public examination. (Axi)\n\n\nEnlightenment is about thinking for oneself rather than letting others\nthink for you, according to What is Enlightenment? (8:35). In\nthis essay, Kant also expresses the Enlightenment faith in the\ninevitability of progress. A few independent thinkers will gradually\ninspire a broader cultural movement, which ultimately will lead to\ngreater freedom of action and governmental reform. A culture of\nenlightenment is \u201calmost inevitable\u201d if only there is\n\u201cfreedom to make public use of one\u2019s reason in all\nmatters\u201d (8:36).\n\nThe problem is that to some it seemed unclear whether progress would\nin fact ensue if reason enjoyed full sovereignty over traditional\nauthorities; or whether unaided reasoning would instead lead straight\nto materialism, fatalism, atheism, skepticism (Bxxxiv), or even\nlibertinism and authoritarianism (8:146). The Enlightenment commitment\nto the sovereignty of reason was tied to the expectation that it would\nnot lead to any of these consequences but instead would support\ncertain key beliefs that tradition had always sanctioned. Crucially,\nthese included belief in God, the soul, freedom, and the compatibility\nof science with morality and religion. Although a few intellectuals\nrejected some or all of these beliefs, the general spirit of the\nEnlightenment was not so radical. The Enlightenment was about\nreplacing traditional authorities with the authority of individual\nhuman reason, but it was not about overturning traditional moral and\nreligious beliefs.\n\nYet the original inspiration for the Enlightenment was the new\nphysics, which was mechanistic. If nature is entirely governed by\nmechanistic, causal laws, then it may seem that there is no room for\nfreedom, a soul, or anything but matter in motion. This threatened the\ntraditional view that morality requires freedom. We must be free in\norder to choose what is right over what is wrong, because otherwise we\ncannot be held responsible. It also threatened the traditional\nreligious belief in a soul that can survive death or be resurrected in\nan afterlife. So modern science, the pride of the Enlightenment, the\nsource of its optimism about the powers of human reason, threatened to\nundermine traditional moral and religious beliefs that free rational\nthought was expected to support. This was the main intellectual crisis\nof the Enlightenment. \n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason is Kant\u2019s response to this\ncrisis. Its main topic is metaphysics because, for Kant, metaphysics\nis the domain of reason \u2013 it is \u201cthe inventory of all we\npossess through pure reason, ordered systematically\u201d (Axx)\n\u2013 and the authority of reason was in question. Kant\u2019s main\ngoal is to show that a critique of reason by reason itself, unaided\nand unrestrained by traditional authorities, establishes a secure and\nconsistent basis for both Newtonian science and traditional morality\nand religion. In other words, free rational inquiry adequately\nsupports all of these essential human interests and shows them to be\nmutually consistent. So reason deserves the sovereignty attributed to\nit by the Enlightenment.\n",
