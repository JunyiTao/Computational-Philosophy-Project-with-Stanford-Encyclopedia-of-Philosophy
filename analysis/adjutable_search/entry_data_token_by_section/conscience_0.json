    "main_text": "Conscience as pluralistic, neutral and subjective\n1. Conscience as pluralistic, neutral and subjective\n\nThe concept of conscience does not bear any connection with any\nparticular substantial moral view (Broad 1940). The voice of\nconscience might suggest different principles and different behaviors\nto different people. In other words, there is no psychological or\nconceptual relation between conscience and any particular moral\nbelief. However, as will be explained below, in the Catholic tradition\nthe idea of an erroneous conscience is sometimes used to refer to\nconscience that fails to recognize the true moral laws which it is\nnaturally predisposed to \u201cwitness\u201d within our heart. As\nfor secular accounts of conscience, the independence of the notion of\nconscience from any substantial moral content can be understood in\nthree senses.\n\nFirst, conscience is a pluralistic notion. To say that a\nperson acted with conscience or that something violates\nsomeone\u2019s conscience does not entail anything about what this\nact consists of or what this person\u2019s moral values are (although\nit might tell us that conscience is itself a value this person holds\ndear). To use a metaphor, conscience is like an empty box that can be\nfilled with any type of moral content. As put by Strohm, \n\n\nconscience has what might be called an \u201cidentity\nproblem\u201d\u2014that it possesses no fixed or inherited content\nof its own, and that it can be hailed and mobilized in defence of one\nposition or equally in defence of its rival. (Strohm 2011: 120) \n\n\nFor example, while some health practitioners raise\n\u201cconscientious\u201d objection to abortion and refuse to\nprovide the service, someone\u2019s conscience might demand the exact\nopposite, i.e., to perform abortions in order to respect what is\nconscientiously believed to be a woman\u2019s right (Joffe 1995).\n\nSecond, conscience is typically a morally neutral concept.\nAppealing to conscience does not usually add anything to the moral\njustification of any particular conduct or principle. Unless one is\ncommitted to the relativistic idea that your belief (or your\nconscience) about x being right or wrong is what makes it right\nor wrong for you to do x (Foot 1979), something is not made\nmorally better or worse, acceptable or unacceptable, simply by being a\nmatter of conscience. For example, the morality of abortion has\nnothing to do with abortion being conscientiously opposed by\nsome health practitioners or conscientiously supported by\nothers. This neutrality does not exclude, however, that an appeal to\nconscience can represent itself a reason for respecting\nsomeone\u2019s moral views, for example a reason for granting someone\na right to object to carrying out certain activities. While appeals to\nconscience do not typically provide any moral reason in defense of a\ncertain moral stance (unless one is a relativist), they might ground\npolitical reasons for respecting individuals\u2019 moral beliefs,\nsuch as for example tolerance or pluralism.\n\nFinally, conscience only concerns the subjective dimension of\nmorality. Even assuming that there are ethical values that, in some\nsense, can be considered objective, conscience only refers to what\nindividuals believe, independently of any external, objective\nproof or justification. And when people state what they subjectively\nand conscientiously believe, they acknowledge that other people might\n(and probably will) subjectively and conscientiously hold different\nmoral views. Thus, when I say that abortion violates my conscience, I\nam not saying (although I might be thinking) that abortion is morally\nwrong by some objective standard, and I\u2019m not necessarily trying\nto convince others that abortion is wrong by some objective standard.\nI am simply stating what I deeply believe and what I want others to\nrespect as my conscientious belief, regardless of how good or bad the\nmoral reasons I can provide to defend my claims are or appear to be to\nothers (McGuire 1963: 259). In fact, when health practitioners claim\nconscientious objection to some medical procedures, they are usually\nnot interested in preventing other doctors who hold different moral\nbeliefs from performing the procedure. They are usually only\ninterested in, so to speak, keeping their hands clean according to\ntheir subjective moral standard.\n\nThese three aspects related to the independence of conscience from\nparticular substantial moral views explain why appeals to conscience\nto justify one\u2019s behavior are usually made with the expectation\nthat no further reason for the behavior in question be required. As\nput by Childress, when an agent appeals to her conscience,\n\n\n[u]sually the agent has given up the attempt to convince others of the\nobjective rightness of his act and is content to assert its subjective\nrightness. (Childress 1979: 329)\n\n",
