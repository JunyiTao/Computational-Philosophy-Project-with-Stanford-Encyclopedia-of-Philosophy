    "main_text": "Conclusions, Open Issues, and Future Directions || The Role of Causation\n7.2 A Single Model of Explanation?\n\nAs noted above, one way in which the attempt to develop a single\ngeneral model of explanation might fail is that we might conclude that\nthere are causal and non-causal forms of explanation that have little\nin common. But even putting this possibility aside, another\npossibility is that explanation differs across different areas of\nscience in a way that precludes the development of a single, general\nmodel. It is, after all, uncontroversial that explanatory\npractice\u2014what is accepted as an explanation, how explanatory\ngoals interact with others, what sort of explanatory information is\nthought to be achievable, discoverable, testable etc.\u2014varies in\nsignificant ways across different disciplines. Nonetheless, all of the\nmodels of explanation surveyed above are \u201cuniversalist\u201d in\naspiration\u2014they claim that a single, \u201cone size\u201d\nmodel of explanation fits all areas of inquiry in so far as these have\na legitimate claim to explain. Although the extreme position that\nexplanation in biology or history has nothing interesting in common\nwith explanation in physics seems unappealing (and in any case has\nattracted little support), it seems reasonable to expect that more\neffort will be devoted in the future to developing models of\nexplanation that are more sensitive to disciplinary differences.\nIdeally, such models would reveal commonalities across disciplines but\nthey should also enable us to see why explanatory practice varies as\nit does across different disciplines and the significance of such\nvariation. For example, as noted above, biologists, in contrast to\nphysicists, often describe their explanatory goals as the discovery of\nmechanisms rather than the discovery of laws. Although it is\nconceivable that this difference is purely terminological, it is also\nworth exploring the possibility that there is a distinctive story to\nbe told about what a mechanism is, as this notion is understood by\nbiologists, and how information about mechanisms contributes to\nexplanation.\n\nA closely related point is that at least some of the models described\nabove impose requirements on explanation that may be satisfiable in\nsome domains of inquiry but are either unachievable (in any\npractically interesting sense) in other domains or, to the extent that\nthey may be achievable, bear no discernible relationship to generally\naccepted goals of inquiry in those domains. For example, we noted\nabove that many scientists and philosophers hold that there are few if\nany laws to be discovered in biology and the social and behavioral\nsciences. If so, models of explanation that assign a central role to\nlaws may not be very illuminating regarding how explanation works in\nthese disciplines. As another example, even if we suppose that the\npartition into objectively homogeneous reference classes recommended\nby the SR model is an achievable goal in connection with\ncertain quantum mechanical phenomena, it may be that (as suggested\nabove) it is simply not a goal that can be achieved in a non-trivial\nway in economics and sociology, disciplines in which causal inference\nfrom statistics also figures prominently. In such disciplines, it may\nbe that additional statistically relevant partitions of any population\nor subpopulation of interest will virtually always be possible, so\nthat the activity of finding such partitions is limited only by the\ncosts of gathering additional information. A similar assessment may\nhold for most applications of the CM model to the social\nsciences.\n",
