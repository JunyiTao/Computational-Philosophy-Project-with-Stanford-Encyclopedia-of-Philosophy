    "main_text": "\n \n\nThe diversity, complexity, and adaptation of the biological realm\nis evident. Until Darwin, the best explanation for these three\nfeatures of the biological was the conclusion of the \u201cargument\nfrom design.\u201d Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection\nprovides an explanation of all three of these features of the\nbiological realm without adverting to some mysterious designing\nentity, by explaining the process of \u201cthe survival of the\nfittest.\u201d But this explanation\u2019s success turns on the\nmeaning of its central explanatory concept,\n\u2018fitness\u2019. Moreover, since Darwinian theory provides the\nresources for a purely causal account of teleology, wherever it is\nmanifested, its reliance on the concept of \u2018fitness\u2019 makes\nit imperative that conceptual problems threatening the explanatory\nlegitimacy of this notion be solved.\n",
