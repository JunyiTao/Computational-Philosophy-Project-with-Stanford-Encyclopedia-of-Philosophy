    "main_text": "Pragmatics || Explicitness\n2.4 Explicitness\n\nA related question is how far an utterance may deviate from\nexplicitness and yet be counted as an assertion, proper or indirect.\nAccording to one intuition, as soon as it is not fully determinate to\nthe hearer what the intended content of an utterance is, or what force\nit is made with, the utterance fails to be assertoric.\nUnderdetermination is the crucial issue. This has been argued by\nElizabeth Fricker (2012). But the issue is controversial, and\nobjections of several kinds have been made, for instance by John\nHawthorne (2012), Andrew Peet (2015, forthcoming) and Manuel\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero (2016,\n 2019b).[10]\n",
