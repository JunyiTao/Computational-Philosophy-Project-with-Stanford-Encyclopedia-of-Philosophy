    "main_text": "Meritocratic Governance || New Confucian meritocracy\n3.1 New Confucian meritocracy\n\nIn recent years, scholars have looked to the Confucian tradition\n (\u00a71)\n to inspire and ground political theories. (See, e.g., Bai 2020; Bell\n2006 and 2015; Bell & Li 2013; Bell & Wang 2020; Chan 2014;\nand Jiang 2013. The reader may also consult recent special issues of\nCulture and Dialogue [2020, volume 8, issue 2] and\nPhilosophy & Social Criticism [2020, volume 46, issue 9],\ndevoted to New Confucian meritocracy.) Incidentally, there has been\ninsufficient interaction between the epistocracy literature and this\none. That is an intersection ripe for research.\n\nThis literature is part political theory and part comparative\npolitics. New Confucian meritocrats frequently point to China\u2019s\nstability and economic success and contrast it with contemporary\ndemocratic dysfunction. That said, it should not be thought that the\nabove-cited scholars, nor New Confucian meritocrats broadly, are\napologists for the Chinese Communist Party. They are not.\n\nThese theories incorporate some liberal democratic features while\nrejecting others, like robust freedom of speech or the \u201cone\nperson, one vote\u201d principle. All deny the truth and usefulness\nof regarding citizens as equals when it comes to voting. New Confucian\nmeritocratic theories are, thus, best understood as hybrids of\nclassical Confucianism and contemporary democratic theory.\n\nThey vary in their particulars. For example, Daniel Bell (2015),\ndrawing from an ideal informing contemporary Chinese politics, calls\nfor \u201cdemocracy at the bottom, experimentation in the middle, and\nmeritocracy at the top\u201d (2015: 9). Bell\u2019s meritocracy is\npurely political (he rejects meritocratic distribution of the\nsort discussed in\n \u00a74),\n and mainly applicable to the highest political offices. Nevertheless,\nthe political system is structured to funnel the most meritorious\ncitizens to its apex (by using, e.g., examinations for public\nofficials).\n\nTongdong Bai (2020), drawing from Mencius, endorses the\n\u201cliberal\u201d part of liberal democracy but not the democratic\npart. He argues for a government that is \u201cfor the people, of the\npeople, but not by the people\u201d (2020: 32). In Bai\u2019s hybrid\nregime, liberal features like the rule of law and human rights do not\nemerge from Western values of individuality and equality but from\nclassical Confucian values. Bai concedes that, so grounded, these\nfeatures\n\n\nmay be more contextual and less absolute than the rights derived from\nan asocial and autonomous [i.e., Western] conception of the\nindividual. (2020: 259)\n\n\nDemocracy should be rejected, according to Bai, because it is less\nlegitimate than a meritocratic alternative. Political authority\nderives from service to the people, and democracy is not doing that\nwell (because of, e.g., the aforementioned voter\nignorance/irrationality). Bai invokes a notion common among\nmeritocrats: There are real differences in virtue, intelligence, etc.\nbetween people; these differences render us appropriate for different\npositions in social and political hierarchies; and that sorting is in\nfact desirable (see also Bell & Wang 2020).\n\nThe idea that liberal features might emerge from Confucian principles\nhas been most fully explored by Joseph Chan (2014), whose\nperfectionistic theory appeals to the Confucian conception of the good\nlife. Chan describes this conception as one that\n\n\ntakes material well-being, moral self-cultivation, and virtuous social\nrelationships as constituents \u2026 with the ideal of sagehood as\nthe highest good. (2014: 44)\n\n\nChan\u2019s preferred political system is one in which this\naccount of the good life is best promoted. In his view, such a system\nwill contain both liberal features, such as human rights, and\nmeritocratic features. As regards the latter, Chan recommends a\nbicameral legislature, with one chamber chosen democratically and the\nother filled meritocratically (elite citizens selecting from a pool of\nexperienced public servants).\n\nLike Bai, Chan\u2019s affinity for liberal features, like human\nrights, is not categorical. We do not possess rights because we are\nhuman; we possess them because they are instrumentally useful in\npromoting the Confucian good life. In fact, for Chan they are ever\nmore contingent than that: They are merely a \u201cfallback\napparatus\u201d for the non-ideal circumstances we find ourselves in.\nIn ideal circumstances, in which all citizens were virtuous and able\nto resolve disputes through mediation, human rights would be\nunnecessary, even destructive.\n\nIn addition to the broad challenges that New Confucian meritocrats,\nqua meritocrats, face\n (\u00a75),\n there are detractors within the Confucian tradition. Some\n\u201cConfucian democrats\u201d argue that democratic political\nparticipation is essential for cultivating Confucian virtues (see,\ne.g., Angle 2012, Hall & Ames 1999, and Tan 2004). These virtues\ninclude humaneness (ren, \u4ec1), wisdom (zhi,\n\u667a), righteousness (yi, \u7fa9), ritual propriety\n(li, \u79ae), and integrity (xin,\n\u4fe1)\u2014the \u201cFive Constant Virtues\u201d.\n\nSungmoon Kim\u2019s (2017 and 2018) pragmatic Confucian\ndemocracy holds that democracy has instrumental power which\nmeritocracy lacks. Democracy better promotes\n\n\nlegitimacy and order acquired through an effective and sustained\ncoordination of complex social, economic, and political interactions\namong citizens who have profound moral and economic disagreement.\n(2018: 6)\n\n\nDemocracy, that is, is better able to cope with the disagreement and\nvalue-pluralism which marks contemporary political life.\n\nElena Ziliotti (forthcoming) argues on epistemic grounds: Because\nsocial well-being is an essential Confucian value, and because\ndemocracy is a better instrument toward that end than meritocracy is,\ndemocracy is more faithful to the Confucian tradition.\n",
