    "main_text": "Correspondence revisited\n3. Correspondence revisited\n\nThe correspondence theory of truth expresses the very natural idea\nthat truth is a content-to-world or word-to-world relation: what we\nsay or think is true or false in virtue of the way the world turns out\nto be. We suggested that, against a background like the metaphysics of\nfacts, it does so in a straightforward way. But the idea of\ncorrespondence is certainly not specific to this framework. Indeed, it\nis controversial whether a correspondence theory should rely on any\nparticular metaphysics at all. The basic idea of correspondence, as\nTarski (1944) and others have suggested, is captured in the slogan\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics \u0393 7.27, \u201cto\nsay of what is that it is, or of what is not that it is not, is\ntrue\u201d (Ross, 1928). \u2018What is\u2019, it is natural enough\nto say, is a fact, but this natural turn of phrase may well not\nrequire a full-blown metaphysics of facts. (For a discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s views in a historical context, see Szaif\n(2018).)\n\nYet without the metaphysics of facts, the notion of correspondence as\ndiscussed in section 1.1 loses substance. This has led to two distinct\nstrands in contemporary thinking about the correspondence theory. One\nstrand seeks to recast the correspondence theory in a way that does\nnot rely on any particular ontology. Another seeks to find an\nappropriate ontology for correspondence, either in terms of facts or\nother entities. We will consider each in turn.\n",
