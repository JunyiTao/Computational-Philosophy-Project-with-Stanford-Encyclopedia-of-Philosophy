    "main_text": "Bodin\u2019s religiosity:  Did He Believe or Not?\n3. Bodin\u2019s religiosity:  Did He Believe or Not?\nDuring his youth, Bodin received a Catholic education and he\nremained loyal to the Church until his death. Demonstrating his\nreligious convictions, in a testament from June 7, 1596, he requested\nto be buried in a Catholic Church. Nevertheless, during his middle\nyears, he was critical of the church hierarchy and occasionally\nexpressed antipapal sentiments. On the basis of this evidence, his\nbiographers have quickly labeled him a Protestant. Yet in his\nLettre \u00e0 Jean Bautru des Matras, a text based on his\nyouthful religious ideas, it is clear that Bodin was not a pure\nProtestant, but rather a critic of the Roman Catholic clergy, its\nhierarchy, and some of its doubtful religious practices.  Bodin was a\nfervent believer in the \u201ctrue religion\u201d which he\nconsidered \u201cnothing other than looking to God with a purified\n spirit.\u201d[13] \n These words reveal less a reformed Calvinist than an adherent of a\nbelief system, whose orthodoxy was unclear, but which could be\ndescribed as natural religion. Bodin possessed an expansive view of\nreligion and a sincere belief in an all-powerful God. If he did agree\nwith some Protestants who criticized the traditional Catholic\nteachings on such matters as the \u201cveneration of images of the\nsaints, the adoration of the Eucharist, and the belief in the fires of\npurgatory,\u201d Bodin did not hold God responsible for these errors\nas certain sects did (e.g., the Epicureans, although the allusion is\nnot clear).\n This would be the equivalent to calling God a trickster\n(sceleratum) for allowing, during the millennia before\nChrist, all men, except the seven thousand (as stated by the divine\nWord), to live in the most despicable evilness. This would be\n absurd. (Lettre Bautru, [Ro] 81).\n \n\n In this letter Bodin refrained from all commentary on the doctrine of\nthe sacraments and dogma. Instead he considered the religion of\nChrist, to which he himself belonged (mea vel potius Christi\nreligio), as accessible to all men of good will. This included\nthe luminaries of the ancient world, most notably the Platonists, whom\nBodin considered \u201cclose to being Christians.\u201d His words,\nalthough far from being those of an adherent of the Reformation, are\nno less those of a critic of the papal curia an advocate of reform\nwithin the Catholic Church who was calling for a return to the\nessential, pure message of the Gospels. On the other hand, amongst\nfervent Catholics, Bodin\u2019s views on the freedom of\n conscience[14] \n caused him to be suspect, even though his opinions on the freedom of\nthe conscience was distinct from his theory of religious tolerance\n(the first was a matter for the private individual, the second for\ncivil and public life).  According to one contemporary in Bodin\u2019s city\nof Laon, Antoine Richart, Bodin was \u201ca politique and a dangerous\nCatholic\u201d (Richart 1869, 68; cited in Chauvir\u00e9 1914, 80).  A\nlater writer, Traiano Boccalini, labeled Bodin a \u201cnotorious\natheist\u201d because he had recommended the \u201cthe freedom of\nconscience\u201d (Boccalini 1618, I, 64, p. 195).\n\nThe Heptaplomeres, written around 1593, appeared\nposthumously (Kiel, 1683). Here the author gives us evidence of his\nreligious beliefs (presuming, for the moment, that Bodin was, in fact,\nthe author). The seven speakers in the work represent as many\ndifferent religions, confessions, and philosophical schools of\nthought: Coroni, Catholicism; Salomon, Judaism; Senamy, Skepticism;\nOctavus, a renegade turned Muslim; Friedrich, Lutheranism; Curtius,\nCalvinism; and Toralbe, natural religion. Toralbe often, but not\nalways, seems to represent the author\u2019s personal beliefs. Despite\ntheir diversity, the seven agree with the prohibition against publicly\ndisputing the fundamentals of religion since \u201call matters that\nare disputed are immediately called into doubt.\u201d They also agree\nthat the freedom of conscience should be respected, because \u201cone\nshould not be constrained in matters of religion, and beliefs should\nbe voluntarily embraced, not imposed\u201d as Tertullian stated.  On\nthe other hand, the speakers differ on the freedom of worship. Even\nCurtius, the Calvinist, admits that \u201cthe desire to allow several\nreligions to practice openly in the same city seems to me to be one of\nthe most problematic issues in the world.\u201d Although the author\ndeliberately leaves this discussion open and without a definite\nconclusion, the dialogue hinges on the thoughts of Toralbe who states\nthat \u201cthe laws of Nature and natural religion, which nature\ninspires in the heart, are sufficient for salvation.\u201d The\ntheologian Johann Diecmann refuted Bodin\u2019s Heptaplomeres in\nhis thesis, De naturalismo tum aliorum, tum maxime\nJ. Bodini (Diecmann 1683). But beginning with Leibniz, the\nHeptaplomeres has not ceased to attract the attention of\nscholars on account of its outstanding erudition and the depth of the\nquestions it addresses.\nHis antipapal sentiments, interspersed throughout his writings,\nhave provided historians with evidence to label Bodin a\nProtestant. Nevertheless, his criticisms of the Catholic Church should\nnot be taken as signs of Bodin\u2019s adherence to the Reformed creed since\nthe same views were expressed by a number of important jurists,\ntheologians, and writers of the period; many of whom held an active\ninterest in the new evangelical ideas. Some would later return to\ntraditional Christianity. Their Catholicism may not have conformed to\nthe orthodoxy of Rome, but it was similar to the reformist program of\nthe Erasmian School (see, for example, the cases of Charles Du Moulin,\nFran\u00e7ois Bauduin, Claude d\u2019Espence, George Cassander, Jean de\nMonluc, and others). Moreover, Bodin\u2019s attacks on the papal curia did\nnot escape the scrutiny of the ecclesiastical authorities. The\nofficial censure of the Church placed the Methodus (1583,\n1591), R\u00e9publique (1591), D\u00e9monomanie\n(1594), and the Theatrum (1628), on the Index of prohibited\nbooks.\n",
