    "main_text": "Arguments in the Age of Materialism || Empirical Considerations\n4. Historical Note on Automatism and the Term \u201cEpiphenomenalism\u201d\n\nJames Ward\u2019s Encyclopedia Britannica (tenth edition,\n1902) article, \u201cPsychology\u201d, contains the following\nsummary of T. H. Huxley\u2019s view: \u201cphysical changes are held\nto be independent of psychical, whereas psychical changes are declared\nto be their \u2018collateral products\u2019. They are called\ncollateral products, or \u2018epiphenomena\u2019 to obviate\nthe charge of materialism \u2026 .\u201d McDougall (1911) roundly\ndeclares, referring to Huxley, that \u201cto him [the doctrine] owes\nthe name by which it is generally known; for he it was who suggested\nthat the stream of consciousness should be called epiphenomenal, or\nthe epiphenomenon of the brain-process.\u201d In Carington (1949), H.\nH. Price expresses his belief that the term\n\u201cepiphenomenalism\u201d was introduced by T. H. Huxley.\n\nIt is interesting, therefore, that the term\n\u201cepiphenomenalism\u201d does not occur in Huxley\u2019s (1874)\nessay on our topic; nor have I been able to find it elsewhere in his\npublished work. (Neither does Huxley use the terms \u201cstream of\nconsciousness\u201d or \u201cbrain-process\u201d.) Of course, it is\npossible that Huxley made oral use of \u201cepiphenomenalism\u201d\nin lecturing. This seems unlikely, however, as he had at his disposal\nanother brief term for the view he was concerned to promote, the\nmeaning of which would have been more immediately accessible to most\naudiences, namely, \u201cautomatism\u201d. This is the term that\noccurs in his 1874 essay, which bears the title \u201cOn the\nHypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History\u201d. Besides\ncontaining the analogy of the steam-whistle that contributes nothing\nto the locomotive\u2019s work, this essay compares consciousness to\nthe sound of the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time,\nand treats volition as a symbol in consciousness of the brain-state\ncause of an action. As Ward correctly noted, nonefficacious mental\nevents are referred to in this essay as \u201ccollateral\nproducts\u201d of their physical causes. The essay is not solely\nconcerned with animals: to the best of Huxley\u2019s judgment,\n\u201cthe argumentation which applies to brutes holds equally good of\nmen\u201d.\n\nHuxley and his contemporaries seem to have been impressed by\npreparations in which frogs had had various portions of their brains\nremoved. Reasoning by analogy with humans lesioned by disease or\nbattle, Huxley finds it plausible that the frogs are not conscious, or\nnot exercising volition; yet when thrown into water, for example, they\nswim just as well as undamaged frogs. Huxley also discusses at some\nlength the case of a Seargent F., who had sustained a shot that\nfractured his left parietal bone. Once or twice a month, this soldier\nwould have a day-long bout in which he exhibited complex behavior\n(e.g., singing, writing a letter, \u201creloading\u201d,\n\u201caiming\u201d, and \u201cfiring\u201d his cane with motions\nexactly appropriate to a rifle in a skirmish) while being plausibly\nunconscious, as evidenced by insensitivity to pins and shocks, sound,\nsmell and taste, and to a great extent, vision. Huxley allows that\nthere can be no direct evidence showing that the soldier is conscious\nor not conscious; but he concludes that he may be devoid of\nconsciousness, while performing his complex and apparently purposeful\nmovements.\n\nHuxley was not alone among 19th century figures who gave vigorous and\nclear expositions of an epiphenomenalistic view. S. Hodgson (1870), W.\nK. Clifford (1874) and H. Maudsley (1886) were exponents of the view.\nRomanes\u2019 posthumous (1896) contains an excellent statement of\nthe view, which was first published in the early 1880s; and William\nJames (1879) likewise offers an early clear statement of it. Both\nRomanes and James follow their statements of the view with arguments\nagainst its acceptance.\n\nNone of the works just mentioned include the term\n\u201cepiphenomenalism\u201d. I have located three articles in\nMind in the 1890s that do use the term (the earliest, in\n1893, hyphenates it as \u201cepi-phenomenalism\u201d). The earliest\noccurrence of the term for referring to automatism that I have been\nable to locate is in William James\u2019s The Principles of\nPsychology, first published in 1890. It occurs in his chapter\n\u201cThe Automaton-Theory\u201d once, in scare quotes; the rest of\nthe time, the view is referred to as the\n\u201cautomaton-theory\u201d or the \u201cconscious\nautomaton-theory\u201d. James attributes the origination of the view\nto Shadworth Hodgson, in The Theory of Practice (1870). A\nsection of this work titled \u201cDependence of consciousness on\nnerve movement\u201d does indeed contain a forthright statement of\nthe view (without \u201cepiphenomenalism\u201d,\n\u201cautomatism\u201d or any other \u201c-ism\u201d tag).\n\nEarly in his discussion of automatism, James (1890) includes some\nremarks about his intellectual development, and refers to his early\nstudy of medicine. \u201cEpiphenomenon\u201d has a use in this\nfield, meaning a symptom concurrent with, but not causally\ncontributory to, the course of a disease. Some early twentieth century\ndictionaries list only this meaning of the term; by mid-twentieth\ncentury, the focal philosophical meaning is standardly given. My\npresent surmise is that the term \u201cepiphenomenalism\u201d came\ninto philosophy from medicine in the late nineteenth century,\npossibly, though less certainly, through William James\u2019s use of\nthe term in his influential Principles of Psychology\n(1890).\n",
