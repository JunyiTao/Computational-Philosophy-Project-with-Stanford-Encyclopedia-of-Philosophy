    "main_text": "Architectural Language and Notation\n4. Architectural Language and Notation\nThe notion that there is or should be an architectural\nlanguage\u2014or more than one\u2014has a provenance dating to\nancient times. In classic form, the architecture-as-language thesis\nruns from the Vitruvian suggestion that the orders present rules for\ncombination and ordering of architectural parts, through\nAlberti\u2019s rhetoric-inspired model for architectural description\n(van Eck 2000), and an analogy common among Renaissance and early\nmodern authors (such as Wren) of architectural rules and expressive\ncapacity with the Latin language. Lavin (1992) suggests that\nQuatrem\u00e8re de Quincy (1803) develops the thesis, from a\ntraditional view of the classical orders as grammatical building\nblocks directly representing primitive structures, to a modern view of\nstructural elements broadly representing social and moral ideas and\nprinciples. Variations of the thesis range over elements of an\narchitectural language, how it may be used, and from whence it may be\nderived.\nThe core idea, in its most prominent form, is that architecture as\na corpus of design ideas (realized or otherwise) features a set of\nfundamental design and style elements which can be combined and\nrelated according to a set of rules (syntax), capable of constituting\nor parlaying meaning (semantics), and subject to contextual\nsensitivity and internal or relational constraints on deployment and\nrealization (pragmatics). Beyond these structural parallels with basic\nfacets of natural language, it is held that the purposes and\npossibilities of architecture qua language yield further\nparallels, best explained by the notion that architecture has, or even\nis, a language.\nProponents of such views tend to subscribe, however, to defenses\nrooted in one or another feature of language. On\nsyntactically-inspired views\u2014the perspectives most indebted to\nthe Vitruvian account\u2014there is at least one architectural\ngrammar or set of rules for guiding proper assemblage of parts and\norientation, relation, and combination of whole architectural\nobjects. Some late twentieth century architectural theory embraced a\ngrammar framework (Alexander et al. 1977; Hillier and Hanson 1984);\nsuch a view also underwrites a formalist vision for CAAD (Mitchell\n1990).  Adherents of the\nview (Summerson 1966) assign themselves the central task of\nidentifying such rules. Even if this is achieved, though, a greater\npuzzle is whether there are identifiably preferable\nsyntaxes\u2014and what the criteria should look like. \nOn a semantics-inspired view, architectural objects or their\ncomponent parts bear meanings. A primary motivation for this view is\nthat, like objects of other artforms, architectural objects are\nexpressive, which suggests that what they express is meaning (Donougho\n1987). Proponents point to an array of architectural meanings,\ninternal or external to the object. The former tells us something\nabout the architectural object (its function or internal composition)\nor how it relates to other architectural objects (stylistic\nconventions); the latter tells us something about the world, as for\nexample, national or cultural associations (per\ngeographically variant design vocabularies), theological or spiritual\nsignificance (per religious design vocabularies), or\nper Hegel (1826), the Absolute Spirit. A more ambitious\nproposal (Baird 1969) has it that architectural objects exhibit such\nsemantic phenomena as metaphor, metonymy, or ambiguity.\nGoodman (1985) proposes that buildings have meaning in that they\nfunction symbolically relative to properties, feelings, or ideas,\nsometimes through \u201cstandard\u201d denotation, as when\nrepresenting symbolically (whether as building part or whole) some\nother object in the world. Primarily, though, buildings function\nsymbolically through exemplification (literal or explicit denotation)\nor expression (metaphorical exemplification) of properties of ideas,\nsentiments, or objects in the world. Buildings only constitute\narchitecture per se, in Goodman\u2019s view, if they bear\nmeaning in one or more of these ways. While Goodman may have\nidentified a denotative role for buildings, this is not clearly a\nsemantic role. \nA third approach, rooted in semiotics, emphasizes the role of\narchitectural objects as signs that prompt spectator behavior (Koenig\n1964, 1970) or indicate aspects of themselves, such as function (Eco\n1968). In either case, architectural objects are taken to operate\nas communicative systems (Donougho 1987). A semiotics program was\nembraced by the late 20th century postmodernist movement in\narchitecture (Venturi, Scott Brown, and Izenour, 1972/1977; Jencks\n1977).\nThe architectural language thesis, in its various forms, is widely\ndiscredited in recent philosophy of architecture. To begin with,\narchitecture features some qualities and exhibits some phenomena\nresembling those of natural language, but the parallels are neither\ncomprehensive nor fully compelling. On the syntactic side,\narchitecture may feature some brand of compositionality but different\nparts of architectural objects do not appear to function as do phrases\nor clauses (Donougho 1987). Syntactic \u201cwholes\u201d do no\nbetter, as there are no architectural assertions (Scruton\n1979/2013). As regards semantics, no likely candidate for an\narchitectural vocabulary regularly yields any specific class or\ninstance of meaning. Whereas for Vitruvius the Ionic order connotes\nfemale sensibility, it has a scholarly or deliberative meaning for\nRenaissance architects, \u201cgravitas\u201d for Blondel\n(1675\u20131683), and good governance for the architects of New\nYork\u2019s City Hall. Nor are there truth conditions such as might\nsupply the meaning of a well-defined architectural sequence (Taurens\n2008). It\u2019s not even clear that architectural communication is\nbest understood as sequential; Langer (1967), for example,\nsuggests that the symbolic communication of architectural objects is\ninstead holistic. As for pragmatics, there is no clear parallel with\nimplicature or related phenomena, hence architecture is incapable of\nthe accuracy or concision of expression we associate with language\n(Clarke and Crossley 2000). Finally, relative to semiotics, not\nall\u2014or even many\u2014buildings signify and we would only\nwant some to do so. \nOn the bright side, it\u2019s not clear that we should want\narchitecture to be more language-like. Regarding semantics, whatever\nwe gain in fixing particular meanings to architectural objects, we\nstand to lose in fungibility of their forms.  Regarding syntax,\nadherence to grammars brings the utility of standards and,\nper Scruton and Harries, a template for the community\u2019s\nvoice\u2014but for some may represent stifling constraints on the\naesthetic imagination.\nIn the end, it is useful to ask what work we expect the\narchitecture-as-language thesis to do. One view (Alexander et\nal. 1977; Alexander 1979) takes the thesis to underscore the robust\nnature of design patterns and known design solutions and, for a given\nculture, a common vocabulary (Donougho 1987). However, it may be\nsufficient to highlight ways in which architecture is like a\nlanguage, though they do not add up to an architectural language\n(Forty 2000). If so, then the thesis works best as a powerful metaphor\nrather than as literal truth. \nAn alternate take on linguistic phenomena in architecture appears\nin Goodman\u2019s proposal (1968) that we think of notational systems\nor schemes for the arts as symbolic systems with potentially\nlanguage-like features. Goodman suggests that architecture is a\nborderline case of an allographic artform, as its notational\nschemes\u2014in the form of plans\u2014are intended to guarantee\nthat all objects as are compliant are genuine instances of the\nwork. (Said intention, Goodman proposes, is not fulfilled.) That an\nobject instance the work just when compliant with the notation would\nindicate the notation\u2019s satisfaction of syntactic and semantic\ncriteria providing requisite grounds for identity across instances,\nand signal a corresponding insignificance of historical context and\nconditions of production to the object\u2019s identity. Goodman, for\nhis part, balks at taking architecture to be truly allographic given\nthe core role of history and context in generating particular\nstructures, and notational ambiguity that marks the analog medium of\ntraditional plans. Digital design may well resolve the ambiguity\nproblem, however, and allow indexing for history and context,\nrendering architecture allographic per Goodmanian criteria\n(S. Fisher 2000b). The term\n\u201carchitectural language\u201d then takes on a\ndifferent\u2014and more plausible\u2014sense.\n",
