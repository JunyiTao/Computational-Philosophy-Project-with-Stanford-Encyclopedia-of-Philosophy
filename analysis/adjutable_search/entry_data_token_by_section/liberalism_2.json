    "main_text": "The Debate About Liberty || Positive Liberty\n1.3 Positive Liberty\n\nMany liberals have been attracted to more \u2018positive\u2019\nconceptions of liberty. Although Rousseau (1973 [1762]) seemed to\nadvocate a positive conception of liberty, according to which one was\nfree when one acted according to one\u2019s true will (the general\nwill), the positive conception was best developed by the British\nneo-Hegelians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,\nsuch as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet (2001 [1923]). Green\nacknowledged that \u201c\u2026it must be of course admitted that\nevery usage of the term [i.e., \u2018freedom\u2019] to express\nanything but a social and political relation of one man to other\ninvolves a metaphor\u2026It always implies\u2026some exemption\nfrom compulsion by another\u2026\u201d(1986 [1895]: 229).\nNevertheless, Green went on to claim that a person can be unfree in\nanother way, a psychological rather than political way, if he is\nsubject to an impulse or craving that cannot be controlled. Such a\nperson, Green argued, is \u201c\u2026in the condition of a bondsman\nwho is carrying out the will of another, not his own\u201d (1986\n[1895]: 228). Just as a slave is not doing what he really\nwants to do, one who is, say, an alcoholic, is being led by a craving\nto look for satisfaction where it cannot, ultimately, be found.\n\nFor Green, a person is free only if she is self-directed or\nautonomous. Running throughout liberal political theory is an ideal of\na free person as one whose actions are in some sense her own.\nIn this sense, positive liberty is an exercise-concept. One\nis free merely to the degree that one has effectively determined\noneself and the shape of one\u2019s life (Taylor, 1979). Such a\nperson is not subject to compulsions, critically reflects on her\nideals and so does not unreflectively follow custom, and does not\nignore her long-term interests for short-term pleasures. This ideal of\nfreedom as autonomy has its roots not only in Rousseau\u2019s and\nKant\u2019s political theory, but also in John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nOn Liberty. And today it is a dominant strain in liberalism,\nas witnessed by the work of S.I. Benn (1988), Gerald Dworkin (1988),\nand Joseph Raz (1986); see also the essays in Christman and Anderson\n(2005).\n\nGreen\u2019s autonomy-based conception of positive freedom is often\nrun together with a notion of \u2018positive\u2019 freedom: freedom\nas effective power to act or to pursue one\u2019s ends. In the words\nof the British socialist R. H. Tawney, freedom thus understood is\n\u2018the ability to act\u2019 (1931: 221; see also Gaus, 2000; ch.\n5.) On this positive conception, a person not prohibited from being a\nmember of a Country Club but too poor to afford membership is not free\nto be a member: she lacks an effective power to act. Positive freedom\nqua effective power to act closely ties freedom to material\nresources. (Education, for example, should be easily available so that\nall can develop their capacities.) It was this conception of positive\nliberty that Hayek had in mind when he insisted that although\n\u201cfreedom and wealth are both good things\u2026they still\nremain different\u201d (1960: 17\u201318). To Hayek, wealth implies\ncapability in a way that freedom does not.\n",
