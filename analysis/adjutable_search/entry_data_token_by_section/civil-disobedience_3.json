    "main_text": "Features of Civil Disobedience || Fidelity to Law\n1.3 Fidelity to Law\n\nWhat makes an act of civil disobedience special? On some accounts, an\nact that satisfies the criteria of civility identified above,\nespecially non-evasion, signals disobedients\u2019 respect for and\nfidelity to the legal system in which they carry out their protest, in\ncontrast with ordinary offenders and revolutionary agents (Rawls 1999,\n322). Signaling one\u2019s fidelity to law by abiding the demands of\ncivility is seen as necessary to thwart fears of disorder or counter\nthe impression that civil disobedients are contemptuous of democratic\nprocedures. Critics point out that agents do not necessarily respect,\nnor have any reasons to respect, the legal system in which they carry\nout their civil disobedience (Lyons 1998, 33\u20136). It is thus\nuseful to distinguish the outward features of the civilly disobedient\nact from the inward attitudes of the civilly disobedient agent.\n\nMany thinkers argue that the link between the disobedient act\u2019s\ncivility and her fidelity to law or endorsement of the legal system\ncan indeed be pulled apart. For one thing, agents intent on\noverthrowing their government may well resort to civil tactics simply\nbecause civil disobedience works (Sharp 2012b). Some theorists\nnonetheless hold on to the connection between civility and fidelity to\nlaw. For instance, some discard some of the requirements of civility\nbut maintain that the civilly disobedient agent can still be motivated\nby respect for law and act within the limits of fidelity to law while\ndisobeying covertly, evading punishment, damaging property, or\noffending the public (Brownlee 2012, 24\u20139; Scheuerman 2018,\n49\u201353; Moraro 2019, 96\u2013101). Others hold that it is\nworthwhile to maintain the link between the act\u2019s civility and\nits conveying fidelity to law, whether or not agents actually endorse\nthe system\u2019s legitimacy, insofar as its self-restraint holds the\nkey to civil disobedience\u2019s place in democratic culture (Smith\n2013, 32\u20135; Delmas 2019, 173\u20134).\n\nOther theorists deny that civil disobedients need to demonstrate\nfidelity to law, taking what Scheuerman (2015) dubs an anti-legal\nturn. Civility, on a number of recent accounts (Brownlee 2012 ch.\n1; Moraro 2019, ch. 2; M. Cooke 2021), is satisfied when agents aim to\ncommunicate with an audience and engage with the public sphere. On a\nradical understanding, the civility of civil disobedience is\ncompatible with tactics \u201cthat will be regarded as uncivil\nbecause of their confrontational or even violent character, including\nmassive disruption, the destruction of property, and the use of\nrestrained force in self-defense,\u201d only excluding para-military\nconfrontation (Celikates 2021, 143).\n\nThis anti-legal turn goes along with what we may call a critical\nturn in scholarship on civil disobedience. Not only do theorists\ncritique the liberal account of civil disobedience as unduly narrow\nand restrictive (as contemporary critics of Rawls already did) and\narticulate a more inclusive concept; but they also critique the\nideology that undergirds the common account, uncovering the ways in\nwhich it distorts the reality of the practice, deters resistance, and\nbuttresses the status quo (Celikates 2014, 2016; Delmas 2018a, ch. 1;\nPineda 2021b, ch. 1). In this vein, several scholars have reassessed\nthe complex legacy of Thoreau and Gandhi to the civil disobedience\ntradition, in order to both show the misappropriation of their\nwritings on political resistance and to call for a reappropriation and\nappreciation of their visions (Mantena 2012; Hanson 2021; Livingston\n2018; Scheuerman 2018, ch. 1, 4). Scholars have also reconsidered the\nhistorical record of the American Civil Rights Movement to excavate\nthe radical understanding of civil disobedience forged by actors\nthemselves, in lieu of the romantic and sanitized version that\ndominates public perception of the Movement (Hooker 2016; Livingston\n2020a, 2020b; Pineda 2021b, ch. 2\u20135; Mantena 2018; and Shelby\nand Terry 2018). Setting the record straight matters not just for\nhistorical accuracy but also because the Civil Rights Movement is used\nas the benchmark to judge contemporary protest movements such as Black\nLives Matter, unfavorably comparing today\u2019s activists with an\nidealized standard with the effect of prejudicing the public against\nthem.\n",
