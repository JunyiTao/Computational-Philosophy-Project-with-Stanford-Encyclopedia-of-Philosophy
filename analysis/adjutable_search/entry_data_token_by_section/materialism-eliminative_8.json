    "main_text": "Arguments For Eliminative Materialism || Eliminative Materialism and the Phenomenal\n3.3 Eliminative Materialism and the Phenomenal\n\nAlthough most discussions regarding eliminativism focus on the status\nof our notion of belief and other propositional attitudes, some\nphilosophers have endorsed eliminativist claims about the phenomenal\nor qualitative states of the mind (see the entry on\n qualia).\n For example, Daniel Dennett (1978) has argued that our concept of\n pain\n is fundamentally flawed because it includes essential properties,\nlike infallibility and intrinsic awfulness, that cannot co-exist in\nlight of a well-documented phenomenon know as \u201creactive\ndisassociation\u201d. In certain conditions, drugs like morphine\ncause subjects to report that they are experiencing excruciating pain,\nbut that it is not unpleasant. It seems we are either wrong to think\nthat people cannot be mistaken about being in pain (wrong about\ninfallibility), or pain needn\u2019t be inherently awful (wrong about\nintrinsic awfulness). Dennett suggests that part of the reason we may\nhave difficulty replicating pain in computational systems is because\nour concept is so defective that it picks out nothing real. A similar\nview about pain has been offered by Valerie Hardcastle (1999).\nHardcastle argues that the neurological basis for pain sensations is\nso complex that no one thing answers to our folk conception. However,\ndespite her own characterization of pain as a \u201cmyth\u201d,\nHardcastle\u2019s arguments appear to be aimed not at showing that\npain is unreal, but rather that it is actually a more complicated\nphenomenon than suggested by our folk conception.\n\nIn another well-known article, \u201cQuining Qualia\u201d (1988),\nDennett challenges not just our conception of pain, but all of our\ndifferent notions of qualitative states. His argument focuses on the\napparently essential features of qualia, including their inherent\nsubjectivity and their private nature. Dennett discusses several\ncases\u2014both actual and imaginary\u2014to expose ways in which\nthese ordinary intuitions about qualia pull apart. In so doing,\nDennett suggests our qualia concepts are fundamentally confused and\nfail to correspond with the actual inner workings of our cognitive\nsystem.\n\nSome writers have suggested an eliminativist outlook not just with\nregard to particular states of consciousness, but with regard to\nphenomenal consciousness itself. For example, Georges Rey (1983, 1988)\nhas argued that if we look at the various neurological or cognitive\ntheories of what consciousness might amount to, such as internal\nmonitoring or the possession of second-order representational states,\nit seems easy to imagine all of these features incorporated in a\ncomputational device that lacks anything we intuitively think of as\n\u201creal\u201d or robust consciousness. Rey suggests that the\nfailure of these accounts to capture our ordinary notion of\nconsciousness may be because the latter corresponds with no actual\nprocess or phenomenon; the \u201cinner light\u201d we associate with\nconsciousness may be nothing more than a remnant of misguided\nCartesian intuitions (see also Wilkes, 1988; 1995 and Irvine and\nSprevak, forthcoming).\n\nA somewhat similar outlook has been proposed by Keith Frankish and\nothers, and is commonly referred to as \u201cIllusionism\u201d about\nconsciousness, a label designed to help indicate why it seems\nto us that phenomenal consciousness is real (Frankish, 2016, 2017).\nIllusionism is motivated in part by broader theoretical\nconsiderations, such as the problematic nature of consciousness from\nthe standpoint of physicalism and the observation that even reductive\naccounts of phenomenal experience typically suggest some sort of\nmisapprehension of what is really going on. Illusionism claims that\nintrospection involves something analogous to ordinary sensory\nillusions; just as our perceptual systems can yield states that\nradically misrepresent the nature of the outer world, so too,\nintrospection yields representations that substantially misrepresent\nthe actual nature of our inner experience. In particular,\nintrospection represents experiential states as having phenomenal\nproperties\u2014the infamous and deeply problematic\nwhat-it-is-likeness of our qualitative mental states. Illusionists\nclaim that these phenomenal properties do not exist, making them\neliminativists about phenomenal consciousness. What is real are\nquasi-phenomenal properties\u2014the non-phenomenal properties of\ninner states that are detected by introspection and misrepresented\nas phenomenal.\n\nAn obvious challenge for such a view is explaining how we can\nexperience something as having feature X without such as\nexperience actually involving the real experience of X. It\ncould be argued that even if the what-it-is-likeness is a feature of\nhow we introspectively represent certain mental states, it would\nnevertheless be a real aspect of introspection\u2014a feature that is\nperhaps relocated, but not removed. Famously, the illusion/reality gap\nseems to collapse when it comes to our inner experiences; as Searle\nputs it, \u201cwhere consciousness is concerned the existence of\nthe appearance is the reality\u201d (Searle, 1997, p.122,\nitalics in original). Frankish insists that we can introspectively\nrepresent ourselves as having a certain type of experience without\nactually having that type of experience: \u201c...when we think we\nare having a greenish experience we are in fact merely misrepresenting\nourselves as having one\u201d (Frankish, 2016, p. 33). Illusionism\nthereby forces us to reconsider the sort of access we have to our own\nexperiential states.\n",
