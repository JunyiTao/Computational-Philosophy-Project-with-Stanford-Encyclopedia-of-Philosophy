    "main_text": "Quaker feminism || Precursors to Womens Speaking Justified\n3.2 Precursors to Womens Speaking Justified\n\n\nThere are several early Quaker texts that challenge these nature and\nscripture-based arguments against women\u2019s spiritual authority. In\ndoing so, the authors continue a tradition that began in the fifteenth\ncentury with the querelle des femmes, an ongoing debate about\nthe moral and intellectual status of women in continental Europe (cf.\nKelly 1984, 68). In this debate, defenders of women protest against the\ncontempt and defamation of women in the works of their male-biased\npeers. To support their cause, they repeatedly cite scriptural\narguments for women\u2019s spiritual equality with men and put forward\nlong lists of female worthies. The Quakers partake in this tradition by\nexplicitly addressing the subject of women\u2019s natural or\ndivinely-ordained subordination to men, as well as those problematic\nbiblical passages about Eve\u2019s transgression and women\n\u201clearning in silence\u201d.\n\n\nIn one of the earliest defences, A Woman Forbidden to Speak\n(1654), Richard Farnworth sidesteps common criticisms of women\u2019s\npreaching by pointing out that natural women are not permitted to speak\nat prayer meetings, for \u201cnothing must speak in the Church in God\nbut the Holy Ghost\u201d (Farnworth 1654, 3). If the spirit of God is\nmanifest in a woman, however, then that woman ought to be permitted to\nspeak\u2014because she speaks with spiritual rather than carnal\nwisdom. As precedents, he cites the examples of Deborah in the book of\nJudges, the prophesying daughters of Philip, the woman named Phebe who\nwas commended to be \u201ca Servant or Minister to the Church\u201d\n(7), and other women who labored with Christ in the Gospel. Far from\nbeing forbidden to speak, these women were received into the church and\n\u201csaluted with an holy kiss in the Lord\u201d (7).\n\n\nIn The Woman Learning in Silence (1656), George Fox\nlikewise challenges those who would limit the spirit of God to\n\u201clearned men, old books, and authors\u201d (Fox 1656, 4). He\ngoes further than Farnworth by arguing that those who prevent women\nfrom speaking in church stop Christ himself from speaking. To\nsubstantiate his point, he provides a list of exemplary females from\nthe Bible, including the daughters of Philip, Hannah (or Anna) the\nProphetess, Priscilla \u201can instructer\u201d, Phebe, Mary\nMagdalene, and other \u201cwomen-labourers in the Gospel\u201d. These\nhistorical women provide proof that the light of Christ is the same in\nthe male and the female\u2014to suggest otherwise is to defy scripture\nand to place limits on the divine power. And \u201cWho is it that dare\nlimit the holy One of Israel?\u201d and \u201cwho is it that dares\nstop Christs mouth? that now is come to reign in his sons &\ndaughters\u201d (5).\n\n\nIn To the Priests and People of England (1655), the Quaker\nwomen Priscilla Cotton and Mary Cole also argue in favor of the\nspiritual equality of men and women. In this work, written during a\nperiod of imprisonment in Exeter gaol, Cotton and Cole explicitly\naddress the Pauline injunctions to \u201cLet your women keep silence\nin the churches\u201d and \u201cLet the woman learn in silence with\nall subjection\u201d. They reinterpret these texts to make them\nconsistent with other passages that imply that it is\npermissible for women to speak or prophesy. Cotton and Cole say\n\n\nthou tellest the people, Women must not speak in the Church, whereas\nit is not spoke onely of a Female, for we are all one both male and\nfemale in Christ Jesus, but it\u2019s weakness that is the woman by\nthe Scriptures forbidden, for else thou puttest the Scriptures at a\ndifference in themselves \u2026 for the Scriptures do say, that all\nthe Church may prophesie one by one, and that women were in the Church,\nas well as men, do thou judge; and the Scripture saith, that a woman\nmay not prophesie with her head uncovered, lest she dishonour her head\n(Cotton & Cole 1655,6\u20137).\n\n\n\nTheir point is that the Bible endorses a woman\u2019s capacity for\nequal spiritual authority and her entitlement to speak in church and to\nprophesy. In light of these endorsements, they say, a different\ninterpretation must be given to those injunctions that suggest women\nmust not speak. Instead we must interpret \u201cwoman\u201d to mean\n\u201cweakness\u201d, and accept that womanliness can be a property\nof both males and females. As an example, they highlight 1 Corinthians\n11:4\u20135, the warning that \u201cEvery man praying or prophesying,\nhaving his head covered, dishonoureth his head. But every\nwoman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered,\ndishonoureth her head\u201d. According to Cotton and Cole, this\npassage might be re-interpreted in a positive light. Both males and\nfemales may speak in church, but if they speak then they \u201cmust be\ncovered with the covering of the Spirit\u201d\u2014they must be in\nthe light, as it were. If they are not in the light, then they speak as\n\u201cwomen\u201d regardless of their actual gender: they speak, that\nis, with a lack of authority or with carnal weakness rather than\nspiritual strength.\n\n\nSimilar arguments can be found in Sarah Blackborow\u2019s Just\nand Equall Ballance Discovered (1660), Fox\u2019s Concerning\nSons and Daughters (1661), Dorothy White\u2019s A Call from\nGod out of Egypt (1662), Katherine Evans\u2019 A\nBrief Discovery of God\u2019s Eternal Truth (1663), and\nFell\u2019s own work, A Call to the Universal Seed.\n",
