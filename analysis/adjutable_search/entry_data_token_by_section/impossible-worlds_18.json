    "main_text": "Objections to Impossible Worlds || The Usefulness of Impossible Worlds\n6.3 The Usefulness of Impossible Worlds\n\nStalnaker (1996) argues that, whilst there is nothing wrong in\nadmitting impossible worlds, not much explanatory work can be expected\nfrom them. For instance, if one takes worlds as sets of propositions,\none cannot then analyze propositions as sets of worlds. But an\nadvocate of impossible worlds may respond that the same point can be\nmade against any account of possible worlds (such as Adams\u2019s)\nthat takes them to be maximally consistent sets of propositions. And,\njust as ersatz possible worlds needn\u2019t be constructed in this\nway, nor need ersatz impossible worlds. Impossible worlds have found\nmany uses in the recent literature, as we have abundantly seen. So we\ndon\u2019t find Stalnaker\u2019s worry convincing.\n",
