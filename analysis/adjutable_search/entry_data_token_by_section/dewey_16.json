    "main_text": "Experience and Metaphysics || Criticisms of Dewey\u2019s Metaphysics\n3.8 Criticisms of Dewey\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nDewey received and responded to many criticisms of his metaphysical\nviews, from 1905\u2019s \u201cPostulate of Immediate\nEmpiricism\u201d and on. Critics often overlooked that his position\nwas aiming to undercut prevailing metaphysical genres; often, his view\nwas just aligned with one or another existing position. (He was taken,\nvariously, as in league with realism, idealism, relativism,\nsubjectivism, etc. See Hildebrand 2003.) One recurrent criticism was\nthat the view advanced in PIE (that \u201cthings are what\nthey are experienced as\u201d) could not possibly yield a metaphysics\nbecause it merely bespoke the kind of subjective, immediate experience\ninimical to a more mediated and objective account. Similar reactions\narrived twenty years late to EN from critics attacking the\ncontrast there between \u201cexperience\u201d and\n \u201cnature\u201d.[19]\n\nSubsequent criticisms honed in on a supposed tension between two foci\nof Dewey\u2019s: \u201cqualities\u201d vs. \u201crelations\u201d.\nQualities are immediate, while relations are mediate; how could both\ncoexist in the same item of experience? There seemed to be a\ncontradiction within Dewey\u2019s\n view.[20]\n Richard Bernstein (1961) seized on this issue, and claimed that Dewey\nharbored two irreconcilable strains, a \u201cmetaphysical\nstrain\u201d and a \u201cphenomenological strain\u201d, but failed\nto sufficiently account for them with his \u201cprinciple of\ncontinuity\u201d. One response to this argued that such critiques are\nvitiated by their unwitting reproduction of the very spectatorial\nstandpoint Dewey\u2019s experiential starting point was designed to\n prevent.[21]\n\nIn recent years, some specialists in pragmatism and American\nphilosophy have debated whether Dewey should have engaged in\nmetaphysics at all. Some, such as Richard Rorty and Charlene Haddock\nSeigfried, have argued that Dewey\u2019s critique of traditional\nmetaphysics was the most he should have done; going further diverted\nhim from more important ethical work (Seigfried 2001a, 2004) or\nplunged him into foundationalist projects he had previously disavowed\n(\u201cDewey\u2019s Metaphysics\u201d in Rorty 1977). Others have\nargued that Dewey invented a genuinely new approach to metaphysics\nwhich avoided old problems while contributing something salutary to\nculture at large (Myers forthcoming, Garrison 2005, Boisvert 1998a,\nAlexander forthcoming).\n",
