    "main_text": "Voltaire\u2019s Life: The Philosopher as Critic and Public Activist\n1. Voltaire\u2019s Life: The Philosopher as Critic and Public Activist\nVoltaire only began to identify himself with philosophy and the philosophe identity during middle age. His work Lettres philosophiques, published in 1734 when he was forty years old, was the key turning point in this transformation. Before this date, Voltaire\u2019s life in no way pointed him toward the philosophical destiny that he was later to assume. His early orientation toward literature and libertine sociability, however, shaped his philosophical identity in crucial ways.\n",
