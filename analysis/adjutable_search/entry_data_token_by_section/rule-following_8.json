    "main_text": "Reductive Dispositionalism\n4. Reductive Dispositionalism\n\nThe most widely discussed attempt at a straight solution to the\nsceptical challenge is reductive dispositionalism. According to a\nsimple version of reductive dispositionalism, the fact that Jones has\nthe concept of addition rather than of quaddition is\nto be identified with (or is constituted by) his disposition to\nproduce the result of adding (and not quadding) the numbers x\nand y in response to arithmetical queries of the form \u2018\\(x\n+ y = \\ques\\)\u2019, and the fact that\nhe means cat by \u2018cat\u2019 is to be identified with\n(or is constituted by) his disposition to apply \u2018cat\u2019 to\ncats. (See Horwich 1998, 2010, 2012 for a systematic development of\ndispositionalism; an answer to Kripke\u2019s challenge is articulated\nin Horwich 2015.) \n\nAs Boghossian notes (1989 [2002: 164\u2013165]), the general form of\ndispositionalism targeted by the sceptic covers both conceptual\nrole theories and causal/informational theories. In both\ncases, the account is intended to be reductive, insofar as the\ncontent-determining dispositions are to be characterized in wholly\nnon-semantic and non-intentional terms. The sceptic\u2019s attack on\nreductive dispositionalist theories is thus an attack on two of the\nmost popular accounts of the determination of content in contemporary\nphilosophy of mind and language.\n\nThe sceptic argues that dispositionalist theories face three problems.\nThe first problem\u2014the finitude problem\u2014is that there is a\nsense in which, much like the totality of our previous linguistic\nbehaviour, our dispositions are finite. Given that the\nextension of the addition function is infinite, containing a\ndenumerably infinite number of triples \\(\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\) such\nthat x plus y is identical to z, Jones\u2019s\nmeaning addition by \u2018+\u2019 cannot be identified with her\ndispositions to respond to arithmetical queries since it is simply\nfalse that she is disposed to answer with the sum when faced with the\nquery \u2018\\(x + y = \\ques\\)\u2019. In\nsome (indeed, most) cases, the numbers involved will be so large that\nJones\u2019s brain\u2019s capacity for computation is far exceeded,\nand Jones may even die long before she is able to grasp the relevant\nnumbers. We might follow Boghossian in dubbing such numbers\n\u201cinaccessible\u201d (2015: 335), and we might define quaddition\nto be a function that diverges from addition over only inaccessible\nnumbers. In this case, the problem is that, given Jones\u2019s\ndispositions, it is indeterminate whether he means plus or\nquus.\n\nThe second problem\u2014the error problem\u2014is that someone might\nbe systematically disposed to make mistakes. Take Smith, who\nis systematically disposed to miscarry when responding to \u2018\\(x\n+ y = \\ques\\)\u2019 queries. When\nSmith produces \u201828\u2019 in response to \u2018\\(19\n+ 19 = \\ques\\)\u2019, we want to be\nable to say that her answer is incorrect in the light of what she\nmeans by \u2018+\u2019. However, if what she means is determined by\nher dispositions, we are forced to say that she actually means some\nnon-standard function (one that corresponds to addition with the\ncarrying operation removed), so that her answer \u201828\u2019 is\ncorrect.\n\nThe third problem\u2014the normativity problem\u2014is that the\ndispositionalist view seems unable to capture the normativity\nof meaning. Given what she means by \u2018+\u2019, Jones\nought to respond to arithmetical queries of the form \u2018\\(x\n+ y = \\ques\\)\u2019 by producing the\nsum of x and y, but the meaning-constituting fact\nproposed by the dispositionalist is at most a fact about how she would\nrespond to queries of the relevant form:\n\n\nSuppose I do mean addition by \u2018+\u2019. What is the relation of\nthis supposition to the question how I will respond to the problem\n\u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019? The\ndispositionalist gives a descriptive account of this\nrelation: if \u2018+\u2019 meant addition, then I will answer\n\u2018125\u2019. But this is not the proper account of the relation,\nwhich is normative, not descriptive. The point is\nnot that, if I meant addition by \u2018+\u2019, I\nwill answer \u2018125\u2019, but that, if I intend to\naccord with my past meaning of \u2018+\u2019, I should\nanswer \u2018125\u2019. Computational error, finiteness of my\ncapacity, and other disturbing factors may lead me not to be\ndisposed to respond as I should, but if so, I have\nnot acted in accordance with my intentions. The relation of meaning\nand intention to future action is normative, not\ndescriptive. (Kripke 1982: 37)\n\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we outlined a number of ways in which a normativity condition might\nbe thought to impose a constraint on accounts of meaning. We suggested\nthat in all of these ways this condition puts at least prima facie\npressure on dispositionalist theories of meaning. We will limit\nourselves in the remainder of this section to some remarks on the\nfinitude problem and the error problem. These two problems indicate\ntwo obstacles that the dispositionalist must overcome in order to meet\nthe extensionality condition.\n\nBlackburn responds to the finitude problem by pointing out that\nfamiliar dispositional properties (such as fragility) are in a sense\ninfinitary: \u201cthere is an infinite number of places and\ntimes and strikings and surfaces on which it could be displayed\u201d\n(1984 [2002: 35]). If a glass has infinitary dispositions, perhaps a\nhuman does too, and perhaps this will yield an extended disposition\nthat covers the case of queries involving inaccessible numbers. Even\nthough we have no way of getting an ordinary glass to Alpha Centauri\n(it would decay long before it got there), we can think of it as\npossessing an extended disposition to break there: breaking is what\nthe glass would be disposed to do were its dispositions on earth\nallowed to manifest themselves on Alpha Centauri. Likewise, even\nthough Jones has no disposition to answer queries involving\ninaccessible numbers, responding with the sum is what Jones would be\ndisposed to do were her dispositions in accessible cases allowed to\nmanifest themselves in inaccessible cases. This would in turn allow us\nto say that the answer that she would accept in those cases is\n\u201cthe one that would be given by reiterating procedures\n[Jones is] disposed to use, a number of times\u201d (1984\n[2002: 35]).\n\nBlackburn\u2019s response to the finitude problem is open to\ncriticism. First, Blackburn\u2019s talk of procedures Jones is\ndisposed to use is illegitimate in this context: to \u201cuse\u201d\na \u201cprocedure\u201d is to follow a rule, and we cannot help\nourselves to the idea that Jones is following the rule for addition\nhere (or any rule, for that matter), as it is Jones\u2019s status as\na rule-follower that we are hoping to recover from facts about her\ndispositions. What we can say is that as far as the accessible cases\ngo, the answers Jones is disposed to give conform to the rule\nfor addition. But, of course, they also conform to the rule\nfor quaddition. What makes Jones an adder, and not a quadder,\naccording to Blackburn\u2019s suggestion, is that were Jones\u2019s\ndispositions in the accessible cases allowed to manifest themselves in\nthe inaccessible cases, she would respond with the sum, and not the\nquum.\n\nHowever, Boghossian (2015: 341) points out that there is a crucial\ndisanalogy between this case and the extended disposition to break on\nAlpha Centauri plausibly ascribed to the glass. To think of the\ndispositions the glass has on earth as manifesting themselves on Alpha\nCentauri, we don\u2019t need to think of the glass in any way that is\ninconsistent with its nature as a physical object. It can be regarded\nas having the same intrinsic physical characteristics on Alpha\nCentauri as it has on earth, and if it is true that, given those\ncharacteristics, it would break if struck on Alpha Centauri, that\nsuffices for the attribution of the extended disposition to break on\nAlpha Centauri. Matters stand differently with Jones. In order to\nthink of Jones\u2019s dispositions to respond in accessible cases as\nmanifesting themselves in inaccessible cases, we would have to think\nof her in a way that is inconsistent with her nature as a finite\nbiological being. This is because responding to queries involving\ninaccessible numbers would require, let\u2019s suppose, a brain the\nsize of the universe. But the fact that with a brain the size of the\nuniverse the sum would be produced no more warrants the attribution of\nthe relevant extended disposition to Jones than does the fact that\nwith a brain the size of the universe she would outplay Magnus Carlsen\nwarrant the attribution to her of the potential to win the world chess\nchampionship. Jones has no extended disposition of the sort adumbrated\nby\n Blackburn.[10]\n The upshot, then, is that Jones\u2019s dispositions do not determine\nwhether she means plus rather than some quus-like function by\n\u2018+\u2019, where quus diverges from plus for inaccessible\n numbers.[11]\n\nWe\u2019ve followed Boghossian (2015) in setting up the finitude\nproblem as fundamentally a problem about determinacy. In a recent\npaper, Jared Warren admits that solving the finitude problem, thus\nconstrued, turns on solving the error problem (2020: 268), and\nproceeds to offer an attempted solution to that problem. Consider the\nfollowing proposal: the fact which constitutes Jones\u2019s meaning\naddition by \u2018+\u2019 is the fact that, when faced with\narithmetical queries involving the \u2018+\u2019 sign, Jones is\nstably disposed to reply with the sum in the overwhelming majority of\nnormal\n situations.[12]\n What are normal situations, and what is it for a disposition to be\nstable? Normal situations are those in which neither external nor\ninternal factors are interfering with Jones\u2019s general cognitive\nfunctioning. More specifically, the normal situations are those in\nwhich Jones is clearheaded\u2014situations in which the air is not\npermeated with mind-bending chemicals, in which Jones is not drunk,\nexhausted, or badly hungover, so that neither external causes nor\ninternal causes are interfering with her cognitive performance.\nFurthermore, to say that Jones\u2019s disposition to respond with the\nsum is stable is to say that, as the number of arithmetical queries\nshe has faced increases, the ratio of answers that give something\nother than the sum to answers that give the sum tends towards zero.\nAnd to keep the bar relatively low, we don\u2019t require that in\nnormal conditions it is metaphysically impossible for Jones\nto answer with something other than the sum. We only require that,\nwhen such conditions obtain, it is rational to be nearly\ncertain that she will answer with the sum. Call the disposition\nwhich we have described here disp. disp\ncorresponds to the meaning-constituting\ndispositions that Warren proposes as offering a solution to the error\nproblem. The proposal is intended to be reductive. Warren notes that\n\u201cnormalcy\u201d, defined as he defines it, \u201cisn\u2019t\nsemantic or intentional or otherwise problematically\nquestion-begging\u201d (2020: 271).\n\nHowever, Warren\u2019s attempt to solve the error problem can be\nquestioned. The error problem arises as a result of the fact that the\nfollowing two possibilities are consistent with Jones\u2019s\npossession of disp. First, Jones means\naddition by \u2018+\u2019 and is responding correctly to\nthe relevant queries. Second, Jones means some quus-like function and\nis responding incorrectly. What Warren thus needs is a\ncharacterisation of normal situations such that the latter possibility\nis ruled out. Thus, what is required is a characterisation of normal\nsituations such that, when those situations obtain, we are entitled to\nbe nearly certain that Jones will answer with the sum, and that in\nanswering with the sum Jones is responding correctly. The trouble\nis that there is an infinite range of functions \\(F_1\\),\u2026,\n\\(F_n\\) that have different extensions from the addition function. If\nJones means some function \\(F_i\\) among them, and if she answers with\nthe sum, she would be answering incorrectly. Thus, the normal\nsituations have to be such that their obtaining ensures that Jones\nmeans by \u2018+\u2019 none of the functions in this open-ended and\ninfinite set. The question that drives Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein\u2019s objection is: how could this be achieved other\nthan through the inclusion of a clause in the characterisation of\nnormal situations to the effect that Jones means addition by\n\u2018+\u2019 (or at least, that Jones means a function\nwith the same extension as addition)? How could the obtaining of a\nnon-semantically characterised set of situations have the effect of\nexcluding every member of an open-ended and infinite set of\nsemantically or intentionally characterised states of affairs (Jones\nmeans \\(F_1\\) by \u2018+\u2019, Jones means \\(F_2\\) by\n\u2018+\u2019, and so on ad\n infinitum)?[13]\n\nThus, it can be argued that the dispositionalist account offered by\nWarren either fails to resolve the indeterminacy problem or does so\nonly at the expense of deploying semantic and intentional notions,\nwhich is inconsistent with its reductive\n aspirations.[14]\nPostscript to section 4: Lewis on Natural Properties\n\nA reductionist position that has been somewhat neglected in the\nrule-following literature is suggested by David Lewis in his\n\u201cNew Work for a Theory of Universals\u201d (1983). Lewis\nwrites:\n\n\nThe naive solution is that adding means going on in the same way as\nbefore when the numbers get big, whereas quadding means doing\nsomething different; there is nothing present in the subject that\nconstitutes an intention to do different things in different cases;\ntherefore he intends addition, not quaddition. We should not scoff at\nthis naive response. It is the correct solution to the puzzle. But we\nmust pay to regain our naivet\u00e9. Our theory of properties must\nhave adequate resources to somehow ratify the judgement that instances\nof adding are all alike in a way that instances of quadding are not.\nThe property of adding is not perfectly natural, of course, not on a\npar with unit charge or sphericality. And the property of quadding is\nnot perfectly unnatural. But quadding is worse by a disjunction. So\nquaddition is to that extent less of a way to go on doing the same,\nand therefore it is to that extent less of an eligible thing to intend\nto do. (1983: 376)\n\n\nTake a predicate like \u2018green\u2019. The totality of facts about\nour previous use and dispositions to use \u2018green\u2019 are\nconsistent with it referring to the property green\nbut also with it referring to the property grue. So, what\nmight ground the claim that the property green is somehow\nprivileged as the referent of \u2018green\u2019? Lewis can be taken\nto advocate a form of \u201cinterpretationism\u201d according to\nwhich semantic facts are constitutively determined by the best theory\nof the data (J. R. G. Williams 2007). Among the a priori constitutive\nconstraints governing what counts as the best theory is a principle\nrequiring that the referents assigned to expressions be the most\nnatural of those consistent with the data. Since green is\nmore natural than grue, it is more \u201celigible\u201d\nthan grue to be assigned to \u2018green\u2019 as its referent.\nLikewise for adding and quadding. In this way, the indeterminacy left\nopen by facts about use is fended off, Lewis thinks.\n\nLewis\u2019s proposal is not ad hoc, as the notion of a\nnatural property that it utilises is required, for example, by his\naccount of laws of nature (see the entry on\n David Lewis,\n section 4.6). However, its application to the rule-following problem\nfaces a number of challenges. First, it is not obvious how it extends\nto the mathematical examples that are the focus of Kripke\u2019s\nWittgenstein. Boghossian writes, \n\n\nI see no obvious notion of naturalness that will cover both the notion\nof a natural property, as it might figure in an account of similarity\nor lawlikeness, and that of a natural function. (2015: 355) \n\n\nIt has also been argued that even if Lewis\u2019s proposal might meet\nthe extensionality condition, it cannot meet the normativity condition\n(Merino-Rajme 2015). \n\nLewis\u2019s proposal is also likely to be challenged on\nepistemological grounds similar to those used by Kripke and Wright in\ndismissing the suggestion that quaddition can be ruled out in light of\nthe fact the hypothesis that Jones meant quaddition is less\nsimple than the hypothesis that he meant addition. A speaker can\nknow that in response to the query \u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019,\n\u2018125\u2019 is the\nanswer that accords with what she meant by \u2018+\u2019, without\nhaving to infer this from facts about her previous linguistic\nbehaviour. That is to say, in recognising that the answer\n\u2018125\u2019 fits what we mean by \u2018+\u2019, we do not\nproceed \u201cby inference to the best semantic explanation of [our]\nprevious uses of that expression\u201d (Wright 2001: 109; see also\nKripke 1982: 40). But this is apparently what we would have to do if\nthe \u201csimplicity\u201d suggestion were correct: the best\nexplanation would be yielded by the simplest of the hypotheses\nconsistent with our previous linguistic behavior. The\n\u201csimplicity\u201d suggestion thus apparently makes a mystery of\nour (generally) non-inferential semantic knowledge. Lewis\u2019s\nsuggestion will be challenged on similar grounds. We do not infer what\nwe mean by \u2018+\u2019 from facts about naturalness together with\nconstitutive principles governing interpretation. Again, the account\nappears to make a mystery of the non-inferential nature of much of our\nsemantic knowledge. Moreover, it faces difficulties in accommodating\nthe authority normally credited to self-ascriptions of\nmeaning. For Lewis, in virtue of the role they play in his account of\nscientific laws, simplicity and naturalness are objective notions.\nHowever, a speaker\u2019s opinions about what she means, unlike, say,\nher opinions about the structure of the world or of our hypotheses\nabout it, are generally authoritative, unless there are special\nreasons to doubt them. What might the basis for this default authority\nbe, if what she means is determined by facts about simplicity and\nnaturalness?\n\nMoreover, the Lewisian view seems to be a form of semantic platonism\n(Child 2011: 126), in so far as it upholds the idea that our meaning\nwhat we do by our words is somehow guaranteed by the structure of\nreality. But it might be taken to be a radical form of semantic\nplatonism, in so far as it seems to leave no room for the\nspeaker\u2019s contribution to the singling out of properties (see\n section 3.3).\n Unlike other versions of semantic platonism, it is vulnerable to a\ncomplaint to the effect that the subjective perspective of the thinker\nor speaker is entirely annihilated.\n\nFor a lucid exposition and critique of Lewis\u2019s position, see\nJ.R.G. Williams (2007). For rare examples of treatments of\nLewis\u2019s views in the context of the rule-following literature,\nsee Merino-Rajme (2015), Gl\u00fcer (2017), and Azzouni (2017).\n",
