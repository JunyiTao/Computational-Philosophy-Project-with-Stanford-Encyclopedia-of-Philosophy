    "main_text": "Republic, Books II, III, X || Republic X\n3.3 Republic X\n\nIn book II the critique of poetry focused on mimesis understood as\nrepresentation; the fundamental point was that poets misrepresent the\nnature of the subjects about which they write (e.g., the gods). They\ndo not produce a true likeness of their topics. In book III, the focus\nshifts to mimesis understood as what one commentator has called\n\u201cimpersonation\u201d; participating in the\n\u201cimitation\u201d by taking on the characters imitated was\nviewed as corrupting in all but a few cases of poetic\n mimesis.[12]\n Surprisingly, in book X Socrates turns back to the critique of\npoetry; even more surprisingly, he not only mischaracterizes the\nresults of the earlier discussion (at 595a5 he claims that all of\npoetry that was imitative was banished, whereas only part of it was\nbanished; 398a1\u2013b4), but recasts the critique in very different terms.\nThis is due in part to the fact that the intervening discussion has\nseen the introduction of the \u201ctheory of Forms,\u201d a more\nelaborate analysis of the nature of the soul, and a detailed\ndescription of the nature of philosophy. The renewed criticism leads\nup to the famous statement that there exists an ancient quarrel\nbetween poetry and philosophy.\n\nBook X starts us off with a reaffirmation of a main deficiency of\npoets: their products \u201cmaim the thought of those who hear\nthem.\u201d And by means of the following schema, this is now\nconnected to a development of the allegation (repeated at\n602b6\u20138) that poets do not know what they are talking about.\nSocrates posits that there are Forms (or Ideas) of beds and tables,\nthe maker of which is a god; there are imitations thereof, namely beds\nand tables, produced by craftsmen (such as carpenters) who behold the\nForms (as though they were looking at blueprints); thirdly, there are\nimitators of the products of the craftsmen, who, like painters, create\na kind of image of these objects in the world of becoming. The\ntripartite schema presents the interpreter with many\n problems.[13]\n Certainly, Socrates does not literally mean that poets paint verbal\npictures of beds and tables. Subsequently, the scheme is elaborated so\nas to replace the craftsmen with those who produce opinion in the city\n(legislators, educators, military commanders, among others), and the\npainters with \u201cthe first teacher and leader of all these fine\ntragic things\u201d (595b10\u2013c2), that is, Homer. The poets are\ntherefore \u201cat the third generation from nature\u201d or\n\u201cthird from a king and the truth\u201d (597e3\u20134,\n6\u20137).\n\nLet us focus on one of the implications of this schema, about which\nSocrates is quite specific. The poets don\u2019t know the originals of\n(i.e., the truth about) the topics about which they discourse; they\nappear to be ignorant of that fact; and even worse, just as a\ntrompe-l\u2019oeil painting can deceive the na\u00efve onlooker\ninto believing that the imitation is the original, so too\nthose who take in poetry believe they are being given truth. Imitation\nnow starts to take on the sense of\n \u201ccounterfeit.\u201d[14]\n Unequipped to put claims to knowledge to the test, the audience buys\ninto the comprehensive picture of \u201call arts and all things human\nthat have to do with virtue and vice, and the divine things too\u201d\nthat the poet so persuasively articulates (598b-599a). The fundamental\npoint is by now familiar to us: \u201cFor it is necessary that the\ngood poet, if he is going to make fair poems about the things his\npoetry concerns, be in possession of knowledge when he makes his\npoems\u201d (598e3\u20135). Even putting aside all of the matters\nrelating to arts and crafts (technai such as medicine), and\nfocusing on the greatest and most important things\u2014above all,\nthe governance of societies and the education of a human\nbeing\u2014Homer simply does not stand up to examination (599c-600e).\nAll those \u201cskilled in making\u201d (tous poietikous),\nalong with this educator of Greece and leader of the tragic poets, are\npainted as \u201cimitators of phantoms of virtue and of the other\nsubjects of their making\u201d (600e4\u20136).\n\nAnd what, apart from their own ignorance of the truth, governs their\nvery partial perspective on the world of becoming? Socrates implies\nthat they pander to their audience, to the hoi polloi\n(602b3\u20134). This links them to the rhetoricians as Socrates\ndescribes them in the Gorgias. At the same time, they take\nadvantage of that part in us the hoi polloi are governed by;\nhere Socrates attempts to bring his discussion of psychology,\npresented since book III, to bear. The ensuing discussion is\nremarkable in the way in which it elaborates on these theses.\n\nThe example which introduces the last stage of Socrates\u2019 critique of\npoetry prior to the famous announcement of the \u201cquarrel\u201d\nis that of deep human suffering; specifically, a parent\u2019s loss of a\nchild (603e3\u20135). How would a decent person respond to such a\ncalamity? He would fight the pain, hold out against it as much as\npossible, not let himself be seen when in pain, would be ashamed to\nmake a scene, and would \u201ckeep as quiet as possible\u201d\nknowing that none of \u201cthe human things\u201d is \u201cworthy of great\nseriousness.\u201d Being in pain impedes the rule of reason, which\ndictates that when we are dealt misfortunes, we must be as unaffected\nby them as possible, preserving the harmony of our souls (603e-604e).\nSocrates sketches the character of the decent and good person this\nway: \u201cthe prudent and quiet character, which is always nearly\nequal to itself, is neither easily imitated nor, when imitated, easily\nunderstood, especially by a festive assembly where all sorts of human\nbeings are gathered in a theater. For imitation is of a condition that\nis surely alien to them\u201d (604e). This may be a sketch of\nSocrates himself, whose imitation Plato has\n produced.[15]\n\nBy contrast, the tragic imitators excel at portraying the psychic\nconflicts of people who are suffering and who do not even attempt to\nrespond philosophically. Since their audience consists of people whose\nown selves are in that sort of condition too, imitators and audience\nare locked into a sort of mutually reinforcing picture of the human\ncondition. Both are captured by that part of themselves given to the\nnon-rational or irrational; both are most interested in the condition\nof internal conflict. The poet \u201cawakens this part of the soul\nand nourishes it,\u201d producing a disordered psychic regime or\nconstitution (politeia, 605b7\u20138; compare this language\nto that of the passages at the end of book IX of the\nRepublic). The \u201cchildish\u201d part of the soul that\nrevels in the poet\u2019s pictures cannot distinguish truth from reality;\nit uncritically grants the poet\u2019s authority to tell it like it is.\nOnlookers become emotively involved in the poet\u2019s drama.\n\nAnother remarkable passage follows: \u201cListen and consider. When\neven the best of us hear Homer or any other of the tragic poets\nimitating one of the heroes in mourning and making quite an extended\nspeech with lamentation, or, if you like, singing and beating his\nbreast, you know that we enjoy it and that we give ourselves over to\nfollowing the imitation; suffering along [\u2018sympaschontes\u2019,\na word related to another Greek word, \u2018sympatheia\u2019] with\nthe hero in all seriousness, we praise as a good poet the man who most\nputs us in this state\u201d (605c10\u2013d5). So the danger posed by\npoetry is great, for it appeals to something to which even the\nbest\u2014the most philosophical\u2014are liable, and induces a\ndream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in the\nemotions in question (above all, in sorrow, grief, anger,\nresentment).\n\nAs one commentator aptly puts it, \u201con the one hand, poetry\npromotes intrapsychic conflict; on the other, it keeps us unconscious\nof that conflict, for the irrational part of our psyche cannot hear\nreason\u2019s corrections. That is why poetry, with its throbbing rhythms\nand beating of breasts, appeals equally to the nondescript mob in the\ntheater and to the best among us. But if poetry goes straight to the\nlower part of the psyche, that is where it must come\n from.\u201d[16]\n Further, the picture of the gods that the Greek poets painted was a\nprojection of the tumultuous and conflictual lower parts of the soul,\none which in turn gave sustenance and power to those very same parts\nof the soul.\n\nThe worry, then, is that in experiencing the emotions\nvicariously\u2014by identifying, so to speak, with the drama\u2014we\nrelease emotions better regulated by reason, and become captive to\nthem in \u201creal\u201d life. In a psychological sense, drama\nsupplies what today we would call \u201crole models.\u201d Socrates\u2019\npoint is not that we think the drama is itself real, as though we\ncannot distinguish between what takes place on and off the stage; but\nthat \u201cthe enjoyment of other people\u2019s sufferings has a necessary\neffect on one\u2019s own.\u201d Why? \u201cFor the pitying part [of the\nsoul], fed strong on these examples, is not easily held down in one\u2019s\nown sufferings\u201d\n (606b).[17]\n And this applies to comedy as well; we get used to hearing shameful\nthings in comic imitation, stop feeling ashamed at them, and indeed\nbegin to enjoy them\n (606c).[18]\n Socrates quite explicitly is denying that aesthetic\n\u201cpleasure\u201d (606b4) can be insulated from the ethical\neffects of poetry. To put the point with a slight risk of anachronism\n(since Plato does not have a term corresponding to our\n\u201caesthetics\u201d), he does not think that aesthetics is\nseparable from ethics. He does not separate knowledge of beauty and\nknowledge of good. It is as though the pleasure we take in the\nrepresentation of sorrow on the stage will\u2014because it is\npleasure in that which the representation represents (and not just a\nrepresentation on the stage or in a poem)\u2014transmute\ninto pleasure in the expression of sorrow in life. And that is not\nonly an ethical effect, but a bad one, for Plato. These are\ningredients of his disagreements on the subject with Aristotle, as\nwell as with myriad thinkers since\n then.[19]\n He is asserting, though without filling out the psychological\nmechanisms in the detail for which one would wish, that from childhood\nup, mimesis shapes our images and our fantasies, our unconscious or\nsemi-conscious pictures and feelings, and thereby shapes our\ncharacters, especially that part of our nature prone to what he thinks\nof as irrational or non-rational.\n\nThe poets help enslave even the best of us to the lower parts of our\nsoul; and just insofar as they do so, they must be kept out of any\ncommunity that wishes to be free and virtuous. Famously, or\nnotoriously, Plato refuses to countenance a firm separation between\nthe private and the public, between the virtue of the one and the\nregulation of the other. What goes on in the theater, in your home, in\nyour fantasy life, are connected. Poetry unregulated by philosophy is\na danger to soul and\n community.[20]\n",
