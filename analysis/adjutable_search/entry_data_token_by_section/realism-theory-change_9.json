Against\nthis point it has been argued that the realist strategy proceeds in\ntwo steps (cf. Psillos 2009: 72). The first is to make the claim of\ncontinuity (or convergence) plausible, viz., to show that there is\ncontinuity in theory-change: substantive theoretical claims that\nfeatured in past theories and played a key role in their successes\n(especially novel predictions) have been incorporated in subsequent\ntheories and continue to play an important role in making them\nempirically successful. But this first step does not establish that\nthe convergence is to the truth. For this claim to be made\nplausible a second argument is needed, viz., that the emergence of\nthis evolving-but-convergent network of theoretical assertions is best\nexplained by the assumption that it is, by and large, truthlike. So\nthere is, after all, entitlement to move from convergence to\ntruthlikeness, insofar as truthlikeness is the best explanation of\nthis convergence.\n\nAnother critical point was that the divide et impera strategy\ncannot offer independent support to realism since it is tailor-made to\nsuit realism: it is the fact that the very same present theory is used\nboth to identify which parts of past theories were\nempirically successful and which parts were (approximately)\ntrue that accounts for the realists\u2019 wrong impression that these\nparts coincide (Stanford 2006). He says:\n\n\nWith this strategy of analysis, an impressive retrospective\nconvergence between our judgements of the sources of a past\ntheory\u2019s success and the things it \u2018got right\u2019 about\nthe world is virtually guaranteed: it is the very fact that some\nfeatures of a past theory survive in our present account of nature\nthat leads the realist both to regard them as true\nand to believe that they were the sources of the rejected\ntheory\u2019s success or effectiveness. So the apparent convergence\nof truth and the sources of success in past theories is easily\nexplained by the simple fact that both kinds of retrospective\njudgements have a common source in our present beliefs about nature.\n(2006: 166)\n\n\nIt has been claimed by Psillos (2009) that the foregoing objection is\nmisguided. The problem is this. There are the theories scientists\ncurrently endorse and there are the theories that had been endorsed in\nthe past. Some (but not all) of them were empirically successful\n(perhaps for long periods of time). They were empirically successful\nirrespective of the fact that, subsequently, they came to be replaced\nby others. This replacement was a contingent matter that had to do\nwith the fact that the world did not fully co-operate with the then\nextant theories: some of their predictions failed; or the theories\nbecame overly ad hoc or complicated in their attempt to accommodate\nanomalies, or what have you. The replacement of theories by others\ndoes not cancel out the fact that the replaced theories were\nempirically successful. Even if scientists had somehow failed to come\nup with new theories, the old theories would not have ceased to be\nsuccessful. So success is one thing, replacement is another.\n\nHence, it is one thing to inquire into what features of some past\ntheories accounted for their success and quite another to ask whether\nthese features were such that they were retained in\nsubsequent theories of the same domain. These are two independent\nissues and they can be dealt with (both conceptually and historically)\nindependently. One should start with some past theories\nand\u2014bracketing the question of their replacement\u2014try to\nidentify, on independent grounds, the sources of their empirical\nsuccess; that is, to identify those theoretical constituents of the\ntheories that fuelled their successes. When a past theory has been, as\nit were, anatomised, we can then ask the independent question\nof whether there is any sense in which the sources of success of a\npast theory that the anatomy has identified are present in our current\ntheories. It\u2019s not, then, the case that the current theory is\nthe common source for the identification of the successful parts of a\npast theory and of its truthlike parts.\n\nThe transition from Newton\u2019s theory of gravity to\nEinstein\u2019s illustrates this point. Einstein took it for granted\nthat Newton\u2019s theory of gravity (aided by perturbation theory)\ncould account for 531 arc-second per century of the perturbation of\nMercury\u2019s perihelion. Not only were the empirical successes of\nNewton\u2019s theory identified independently of the successor\ntheory, but also some key theoretical components of Newton\u2019s\ntheory\u2014the law of attraction and the claim that the\ngravitational effects from the planets on each other were a\nsignificant cause of the deviations from their predicted\norbits\u2014were taken to be broadly correct and explanatory (of at\nleast part) of the successes. Einstein could clearly identify the\nsources of successes of Newton\u2019s theory independently of his own\nalternative theory and it is precisely for this reason that he\ninsisted that he had to recover Newton\u2019s law of attraction (a\nkey source of the Newtonian success) as a limiting case of his own\nGTR. He could then show that his new theory could do both: it could\nrecover the (independently identified) sources of successes of\nNewton\u2019s theory (in the form of the law of attraction)\nand account for its failures by identifying further causal\nfactors (the curvature of space-time) that account for the\ndiscrepancies between the predicted orbits of planets (by\nNewton\u2019s theory of gravity) and the observed\n trajectories.[6]\n\nApart from Stanford\u2019s case against the divide et impera\nmove, the latter has become the target of criticism\u2014among\nothers\u2014by Timothy Lyons.\n [7]\n Lyons (2006) focuses his critique on Psillos\u2019s criterion\nfor the conditions under which a hypothesis indispensably contributes\nto the derivation of novel predictions. In his (1999: 100) Psillos\nsays:\n\n\nSuppose that \\(H\\) together with another set of hypotheses \\(H'\\)\n(and some auxiliaries A) entail a\nprediction \\(P\\). \\(H\\) indispensably contributes to the\ngeneration of \\(P\\) if \\(H'\\) and A alone cannot\nyield \\(P\\) and no other available hypothesis \\(H^*\\) which\nis consistent with \\(H'\\) and A can replace \\(H\\) without\nloss in the relevant derivation of \\(P\\). \n\n\nLyons interprets this passage\u2014as well as Psillos\u2019s\nsubsequent claim that \\(H^*\\) must satisfy some \u201cnatural epistemic\nconstraints\u201d, such as being \u201cindependently motivated, non\nad hoc, potentially explanatory etc.\u201d (ibid.)\u2014as providing\nthe following criterion for the essential role of hypothesis \\(H\\) in the\nderivation of prediction \\(P\\):\n\nFor \\(H\\) to be essential [for the derivation of \\(P\\)]:\n\n(1)\nIt must be the case that \\(H + H' + A\\) leads to \\(P\\).\n(2)\nIt must not be the case that \\(H' + A\\), alone, leads to\n\\(P\\).\n(3)\nIt must not be the case that any alternative, \\(H^*\\), is\navailable \n \n(a)\nthat is consistent with \\(H' + A\\) and \n(b)\nthat when conjoined to \\(H' + A\\) leads to \\(P\\) and\n(c)\nthat is non-ad hoc ([\u2026] it does not use the data\npredicted by \\(P\\) [\u2026], is potentially explanatory, etc.) (Lyons\n2006: 539).\n\n\n\nThus construed, Lyons criticizes Psillos\u2019 criterion for\nessentiality, as being \u201csuperfluous, unmotivated, and therefore\ninappropriate\u201d (2006: 541). Briefly put, his point is that\ncondition 3 \u201cunacceptably overshoots\u201d the realist\u2019s\ngoal, since the absence of an alternative \\(H^*\\) has \u201cno bearing\nwhatsoever on whether \\(H\\) itself contributed to, was deployed\nin, the derivation of a given prediction\u201d (2006: 540). Besides,\nLyons states that condition 3 is so vague that it is \u201csimply\ninapplicable\u201d (2006: 542). According to Mario Alai\u2019s\n(2021) summary of Lyons\u2019s point, condition 3 doesn\u2019t\nspecify (a) when the alternative hypothesis \\(H^*\\) must\nor must not be available, (b) what \u2018potentially\nexplanatory etc.\u2019 means and (c) whether\n\\(H'\\) and \\(A\\) must be essential too. In addition;\n(d) it doesn\u2019t state whether \\(H^*\\) is allowed to lead to\nlosses of other confirmed predictions and (e) whether \\(H^*\\)\nshould be consistent with those elements of \\(H'\\)\nand \\(A\\), which, though they are \u2018essential\u2019 for other\npredictions, they are dispensable when it comes to the derivation of\nthe prediction under scrutiny. Based on these points, Lyons suggests\nthat even if realists might hold onto conditions 1 and 2 above,\ncondition 3 has to be abandoned, thereby isolating \u201cthe\ndeployment realist\u2019s fundamental insight\u201d, viz., that\ncredit should be attributed to those posits that\nactually\u2014as opposed to essentially\u2014have\nbeen deployed in the derivation of empirical predictions (2006,543).\n\n\nIn reply to Lyons, Peter Vickers (2017) and Alai (2021) have defended\nthe divide et impera move against the PI by suggesting the\nfollowing refinement of condition 3 (let\u2019s call it\n3\u2032):\n\n(3\u2032)\n\\(H\\) does not merit realist commitment whenever\n\\(H\\) is doing work in the derivation solely in virtue of the fact that it\nentails some other proposition \\(H^*\\) which itself is sufficient, when\ncombined with the other assumptions in play, for the relevant\nderivational step (Vickers, 2017: 3229).\n\n\nAccording to Vickers, when realists are presented with an instance of\na (seemingly) success-inducing-yet-false hypothesis, all they need to\ndo is to show that the specific hypothesis does not satisfy the above\ncondition. It should be noted, however, that this, in essence, is the\nstrategy recommended by Psillos in his 1994, where he aimed to show,\nusing specific cases, that various assumptions such as that heat is a\nmaterial substance in the case of the caloric theory of heat, do not\nmerit realist commitment, because there are weaker assumptions that\nfuel the derivation of successful predictions. \n\nAlai claims that substituting condition 3\u2032 for\ncondition 3 is an improvement of the divide et impera move,\nfor not only does condition 3\u2032 perform the task\nthat Psillos had in mind, but also escapes from Lyons\u2019\ncriticisms (2021: 188). To begin with, condition\n3\u2032 is said not to suffer from\nthe (alleged) vagueness of condition 3, for according to Alai:\n(a) there is no question about when the alternative\n\\(H^*\\) is available; (b) there is no need to specify\nwhat \u2018explanatory\u2019 means; and (c) it is not\nrequired that \\(H'\\) and \\(A\\) are also essential. In\naddition, (d) condition 3\u2032 allows that\n\\(H^*\\) may lead to losses of other confirmed predictions and (e),\nsince 3\u2032 excludes only hypotheses \\(H^*\\) which are\nentailed by \\(H\\), \\(H^*\\) are ipso facto consistent with\n\\(H'\\) and \\(A\\).\n\nNow, it is rather evident that condition 3\u2032 is neither\nsuperfluous nor unmotivated, since as Alai (2021, 188) stressed it is\nmotivated by a plausible epistemic principle associated with the\nOccam\u2019s razor:\n\n\nin abductions we can assume only what is essential, i.e., the weakest\nhypothesis sufficient to explain a given effect; but if a hypotheses\n[sic], although deployed, was not essential in deriving [the novel\nprediction at hand], it is not essential in explaining its derivation\neither; therefore deployment realists need not (and must not) be\ncommitted to its truth. \n\n\nIn sum, contra Lyons, condition 3\u0384 is both\nepistemologically motivated as well as indispensable for the proper\napplication of the divide et impera move. \n\nThe \u2018Vickers-Alai\u2019 refinement of the divide et\nimpera move has not been uncontested. It has been criticized on\nprincipled grounds, as well as for not being sufficient in dealing\nwith PI-style challenges. For instance, Dean Peters (2014) argues\ninter alia that Vickers\u2019 criterion for essentiality\ncannot account for the unificatory aspect of scientific theorizing,\nwhereas Florian Boge (2021) and Dana Tulodziecki (2021) have provided\nnew historical counterexamples\u2014within the field of nuclear\nphysics and phychometry, and the 19th century miasma theory\nof disease, respectively\u2014that cannot be handled, or so it is\nargued, by the \u2018Vickers-Alai\u2019 criterion. \n\nIt should also be noted that, according to Vickers himself, the\nemployment of condition 3\u2032 in dealing with PI\nseems to bring scientific realism dangerously close to structural\nrealism. As has already been said, Vickers\u2019s recipe for handling\na PI-style challenge is roughly the following: take the (false)\nhypothesis \\(H\\) that, according to the anti-realist, is employed\nin the derivation of a prediction \\(P\\), identify an\n(uncontested) \\(H^*\\) which is entailed by \\(H\\) and show\nthat \\(H^*\\) is enough for the derivation of \\(P\\). This\nrecipe goes a long way in disarming Lyon\u2019s objection. And yet,\nVickers notes, an even weaker hypothesis \\(H^{**}\\) is available, viz., that\nfor the prediction of P only the mathematical structure of \\(H^*\\) is\nrequired. But then, \u201conly the very abstract\n\u2018structure\u2019 truly merits realist commitment, as structural\nrealists like to claim\u201d (2017: 3227). If we take\n\u2018structure\u2019 to be identified with the Ramsey sentence of a\ngiven theory (see the next section), then Vickers\u2019 concern is,\nat least prima facie, a plausible one. For the Ramsey\nsentence of a theory is obviously entailed by the latter and, as is\nwell known, any theory and its Ramsey sentence have exactly the same\nobservational consequences. Hence, it seems that the employment of\ncondition 3\u2032 forces realists to restrict their\ncommitment solely towards the Ramsey sentences of their favoured\ntheories. In reply, however, it should be stressed that though\nVickers\u2019s concern is prima facie warranted, it is far\nfrom conclusive. In fact, after raising his concern, Vickers\ndoesn\u2019t further explore it, whereas Alai (2021: 211\u2013212) has\nargued that from the mere application of condition\n3\u2032 \u201cit doesn\u2019t follow that every\nhypothesis is dispensable in favor of its Ramsey sentence\u201d.\n",
