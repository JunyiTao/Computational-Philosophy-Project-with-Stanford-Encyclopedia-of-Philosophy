    "main_text": "Counterfactuals and Philosophy || Metaphysical Analysis and Scientific Explanation\n1.3 Metaphysical Analysis and Scientific Explanation\n\nCounterfactuals have played an equally central role in metaphysics and\nthe philosophy of science. They have featured in metaphysical theories\nof causation, supervenience, grounding, ontological dependence, and\ndispositions. They have also featured in issues at the intersection of\nmetaphysics and philosophy of science like laws of nature and\nscientific explanation. This section will briefly overview these\napplications, largely linking to related entries that cover these\napplications in more depth. But, this overview is more than just a\nlist of how counterfactuals have been applied in these areas. It helps\nidentify a cluster of inter-related concepts (and/or properties) that\nare fruitfully studied together rather than in isolation.\n\nMany philosophers have proposed to analyze causal concepts in terms of\ncounterfactuals (e.g., D. Lewis 1973a,\nMackie 1974). The basic idea is that\n (10)\n can be understood in terms of something like\n (11)\n (see\n counterfactual theories of causation\n for further discussion). \n\n(10)A caused C.\n(11)If A had not\noccurred, C would not have occurred.\n\n\nThis basic idea has been elaborated and developed in several ways.\nD. Lewis (1973a, c) refines it using his\nsimilarity semantics for counter\u00adfactuals\u2014see\n \u00a72.3.\n The resulting counterfactual analysis of causation faces a number of\nchallenges\u2014see\n counterfactual theories of causation\n for discussion and references. But this has simply inspired a new\nwave of counterfactual analyses that use different tools.\n\nHitchcock (2001, 2007) and Woodward\n(2003: Ch.5) develop counterfactual\nanalyses of causation using the tools of Bayesian networks (or\n\u201ccausal models\u201d) and structural equations described back\nin\n \u00a71.2.3.\n The rough idea of the analysis is as follows. Given a graph like the\none in\n Figure 2,\n X can be said to be a cause of Y just in case there is\na path from X to Y and changing just the value of\nX changes the value of Y. According to Hitchcock\n(2001) and Woodward\n(2002, 2003), this analysis of\ncausation counts as a counterfactual analysis because the basic\nstructural equations, e.g., \\(C\\dequal A\\land B\\), are best understood\nas primitive counterfactual claims, e.g., if A and B had\nbeen true, C would have been true. While not all theories of\ncausation that employ structural equations are counterfactual\ntheories, structural equations are central to many of the contemporary\ncounterfactual theories of\n causation.[13]\n See\n counterfactual theories of causation\n for further developments and critical reactions to this account of\ncausation.\n\nRecently, Schaffer (2016) and Wilson\n(2018) have also used structural\nequations to articulate a counterfactual theory of metaphysical grounding.[14]\n Metaphysical grounding is a concept widely employed in metaphysics\nthroughout its history, but has been the focus of intense attention\nonly recently\u2014see entry\n metaphysical grounding\n for further details. As Schaffer (2016)\nputs it, the fact that Koko the gorilla lives in California is not a\nfundamental fact because it is grounded in more basic facts about the\nphysical world, perhaps facts about spacetime and certain physical\nfields. Statements articulating these grounding facts constitute\ndistinct metaphysical explanations. So conceived, metaphysical\ngrounding is among the most central concepts in metaphysics. The key\nproposals in Schaffer (2016) and Wilson\n(2018) are to use structural equations\nto model grounding relations, and not just causal relations, and in\ndoing so capture parallels between causation and grounding. Indeed,\nthey define grounding in terms of structural equations in the same way\nas the authors above defined causation in terms of structural\nequations. The key difference is that the equations articulate what\ngrounds what. While this approach to grounding has its critics (e.g.,\nKoslicki 2016), it is worth noting here\nsince it places counterfactuals at the center of metaphysical explanations.[15]\n Counterfactuals have been implicated in other key metaphysical\ndebates. Work on dispositions is a prominent example. A glass\u2019s\nfragility is a curious property: the glass has it in virtue of\npossibly shattering in certain conditions, even if those\nconditions are never manifested in the actual world, unlike say, the\nglass\u2019s shape. This dispositional property is quite naturally\nunderstood in terms of a counterfactual claim: \n\n(12)A\nglass is fragile if and only if it would break if it\nwere struck in the right way.\n\n\nEarly analyses of this form were pursued by Ryle\n(1949), Quine\n(1960), and Goodman (1955), and\nhave remained a major position in the literature on dispositions. See\n dispositions\n for further discussion and references.\n\nIt is not just metaphysical explanation where counterfactuals\nhave been central. They also feature prominently in accounts of\nscientific explanation and laws of nature. Strict empiricists\nhave attempted to characterize scientific explanation without reliance\non counterfactuals, despite the fact that they tend to creep\nin\u2014for further background on this see\n scientific explanation.\n Scientific explanations appeal to laws of nature, and laws of nature\nare difficult to separate from counterfactuals. Laws of nature are\ncrucially different from accidental generalizations, but how? One\nprominent idea is that they \u201csupport counterfactuals\u201d. As\nChisholm (1955: 97) observed, the\ncounterfactual\n (14)\n follows from the corresponding law\n (13)\n but the counterfactual\n (16)\n does not follow from the corresponding accidental generalization\n (15).\n \n\n(13)All gold is malleable.\n(14)If that metal were gold, it would be malleable.\n(15)Every Canadian parent of quintuplets in\nthe first half of the 20th century is named \u201cDionne\u201d.\n(16)If Jones, who is Canadian, had been\nparent of quintuplets during the first half of the 20th century, he\nwould have been named \u201cDionne\u201d.\n\n\nA number of prominent views have emerged from pursuing this\nconnection. Woodward (2003) argues that\nthe key feature of an explanation is that it answers\nwhat-if-things-had-been-different questions, and integrates\nthis proposal with a structural equations approach to causation and\n counterfactuals.[16]\nLange (1999, 2000, 2009) proposes an\nanti-reductionist account of laws according to which they are\nidentified by their invariance under certain counterfactuals. Maudlin\n(2007: Ch.1) also proposes an\nanti-reductionist account of laws, but instead uses laws to define the\ntruth-conditions of counterfactuals relevant to physical explanations.\nFor more on these views see\n laws of nature.\n",
