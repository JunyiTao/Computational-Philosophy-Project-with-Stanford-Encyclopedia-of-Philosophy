The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a\nset-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be\nconstrued as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows\none to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments.

The origins\n\nSet theory, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the work\nof Georg Cantor. One might say that set theory was born in late 1873,\nwhen he made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum, that is,\nthe real line, is not countable, meaning that its points cannot be\ncounted using the natural numbers. So, even though the set of natural\nnumbers and the set of real numbers are both infinite, there are more\nreal numbers than there are natural numbers, which opened the door to\nthe investigation of the different sizes of infinity. See the entry on\nthe\n early development of set theory\n for a discussion of the origin of set-theoretic ideas and their use\nby different mathematicians and philosophers before and around\nCantor\u2019s time.\n\nAccording to Cantor, two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same size, or\ncardinality, if they are bijectable, i.e., the elements of\n\\(A\\) can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of\n\\(B\\). Thus, the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers and the set\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers have different cardinalities. In 1878\nCantor formulated the famous Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which\nasserts that every infinite set of real numbers is either countable,\ni.e., it has the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), or has the same\ncardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). In other words, there are only two\npossible sizes of infinite sets of real numbers. The CH is the most\nfamous problem of set theory. Cantor himself devoted much effort to\nit, and so did many other leading mathematicians of the first half of\nthe twentieth century, such as Hilbert, who listed the CH as the first\nproblem in his celebrated list of 10 (later expanded to 23 in the\npublished version) unsolved mathematical problems presented in 1900 at\nthe Second International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. The\nattempts to prove the CH led to major discoveries in set theory, such\nas the theory of constructible sets, and the forcing technique, which\nshowed that the CH can neither be proved nor disproved from the usual\naxioms of set theory. To this day, the CH remains open.\n\nEarly on, some inconsistencies, or paradoxes, arose from a naive use\nof the notion of set; in particular, from the deceivingly natural\nassumption that every property determines a set, namely the set of\nobjects that have the property. One example is Russell\u2019s\nParadox, also known to Zermelo: \n\n\nconsider the property of sets of not being members of themselves. If\nthe property determines a set, call it \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is a member\nof itself if and only if \\(A\\) is not a member of itself.\n\n\nThus, some collections, like the collection of all sets, the\ncollection of all ordinals numbers, or the collection of all cardinal\nnumbers, are not sets. Such collections are called proper\nclasses.\n\nIn order to avoid the paradoxes and put it on a firm footing, set\ntheory had to be axiomatized. The first axiomatization was due to\nZermelo (1908) and it came as a result of the need to spell out the\nbasic set-theoretic principles underlying his proof of Cantor\u2019s\nWell-Ordering Principle. Zermelo\u2019s axiomatization avoids\nRussell\u2019s Paradox by means of the Separation axiom, which is\nformulated as quantifying over properties of sets, and thus it is a\nsecond-order statement. Further work by Skolem and Fraenkel led to the\nformalization of the Separation axiom in terms of formulas of\nfirst-order, instead of the informal notion of property, as well as to\nthe introduction of the axiom of Replacement, which is also formulated\nas an axiom schema for first-order formulas (see next section). The\naxiom of Replacement is needed for a proper development of the theory\nof transfinite ordinals and cardinals, using transfinite recursion\n(see\n Section 3).\n It is also needed to prove the existence of such simple sets as the\nset of hereditarily finite sets, i.e., those finite sets whose\nelements are finite, the elements of which are also finite, and so on;\nor to prove basic set-theoretic facts such as that every set is\ncontained in a transitive set, i.e., a set that contains all elements\nof its elements (see Mathias 2001 for the weaknesses of Zermelo set\ntheory). A further addition, by von Neumann, of the axiom of\nFoundation, led to the standard axiom system of set theory, known as\nthe Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice, or ZFC.\n\nOther axiomatizations of set theory, such as those of von\nNeumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del (NBG), or Morse-Kelley (MK), allow also for\na formal treatment of proper classes.\n2. The axioms of set theory\n\nZFC is an axiom system formulated in first-order logic with equality\nand with only one binary relation symbol \\(\\in\\) for membership. Thus,\nwe write \\(A\\in B\\) to express that \\(A\\) is a member of the set\n\\(B\\). See the\n\nSupplement on Basic Set Theory\n\n\nfor further details. See also the\n\nSupplement on Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory\n\n\nfor a formalized version of the axioms and further comments. We state\nbelow the axioms of ZFC informally.\n2.1 The axioms of ZFC\n\n\n\nExtensionality: If two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same\nelements, then they are equal.\n\n\nNull Set: There exists a set, denoted by \\({\\varnothing}\\)\nand called the empty set, which has no elements.\n\n\nPair: Given any sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there exists a set,\ndenoted by \\(\\{ A,B\\}\\), which contains \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as its only\nelements. In particular, there exists the set \\(\\{ A\\}\\) which has\n\\(A\\) as its only element.\n\n\nPower Set: For every set \\(A\\) there exists a set, denoted by\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(A)\\) and called the power set of \\(A\\), whose\nelements are all the subsets of \\(A\\).\n\n\nUnion: For every set \\(A\\), there exists a set, denoted by\n\\(\\bigcup A\\) and called the union of \\(A\\), whose elements\nare all the elements of the elements of \\(A\\).\n\n\nInfinity: There exists an infinite set. In particular, there\nexists a set \\(Z\\) that contains \\({\\varnothing}\\) and such that if\n\\(A\\in Z\\), then \\(\\bigcup\\{ A, \\{ A\\}\\}\\in Z\\).\n\n\nSeparation: For every set \\(A\\) and every given property,\nthere is a set containing exactly the elements of \\(A\\) that have that\nproperty. A property is given by a formula \\(\\varphi\\) of the\nfirst-order language of set theory.\n\nThus, Separation is not a single axiom but an axiom schema, that is,\nan infinite list of axioms, one for each formula \\(\\varphi\\).\n\n\nReplacement: For every given definable function with\ndomain a set \\(A\\), there is a set whose elements are all the values\nof the function.\n\nReplacement is also an axiom schema, as definable functions are given\nby formulas.\n\n\nFoundation: Every non-empty set \\(A\\) contains an\n\\(\\in\\)-minimal element, that is, an element such that no element of\n\\(A\\) belongs to it.\n\n\nThese are the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or ZF. The axioms\nof Null Set and Pair follow from the other ZF axioms, so they may be\nomitted. Also, Replacement implies Separation.\n\nFinally, there is the Axiom of Choice (AC):\n\n\n\nChoice: For every set \\(A\\) of pairwise-disjoint non-empty\nsets, there exists a set that contains exactly one element from each\nset in \\(A\\).\n\n\nThe AC was, for a long time, a controversial axiom. On the one hand,\nit is very useful and of wide use in mathematics. On the other hand,\nit has rather unintuitive consequences, such as the Banach-Tarski\nParadox, which says that the unit ball can be partitioned into\nfinitely-many pieces, which can then be rearranged to form two unit\nballs. The objections to the axiom arise from the fact that it asserts\nthe existence of sets that cannot be explicitly defined. But\nG\u00f6del\u2019s 1938 proof of its consistency, relative to the\nconsistency of ZF, dispelled any suspicions left about it.\n\nThe Axiom of Choice is equivalent, modulo ZF, to the Well-ordering\nPrinciple, which asserts that every set can be well-ordered,\ni.e., it can be linearly ordered so that every non-empty subset has a\nminimal element.\n\nAlthough not formally necessary, besides the symbol \\(\\in\\) one\nnormally uses for convenience other auxiliary defined symbols. For\nexample, \\(A\\subseteq B\\) expresses that \\(A\\) is a subset of\n\\(B\\), i.e., every member of \\(A\\) is a member of \\(B\\). Other symbols\nare used to denote sets obtained by performing basic operations, such\nas \\(A\\cup B\\), which denotes the union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\ni.e., the set whose elements are those of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); or \\(A\\cap\nB\\), which denotes the intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), i.e.,\nthe set whose elements are those common to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The\nordered pair \\((A,B)\\) is defined as the set \\(\\{ \\{ A\\},\\{\nA,B\\}\\}\\). Thus, two ordered pairs \\((A,B)\\) and \\((C,D)\\) are equal\nif and only if \\(A=C\\) and \\(B=D\\). And the Cartesian product\n\\(A\\times B\\) is defined as the set of all ordered pairs \\((C,D)\\)\nsuch that \\(C\\in A\\) and \\(D\\in B\\). Given any formula\n\\(\\varphi(x,y_1,\\ldots ,y_n)\\), and sets \\(A,B_1,\\ldots ,B_n\\), by the\naxiom of Separation one can form the set of all those elements of\n\\(A\\) that satisfy the formula \\(\\varphi(x,B_1,\\ldots ,B_n)\\). This\nset is denoted by \\(\\{ a\\in A: \\varphi(a,B_1,\\ldots ,B_n)\\}\\). In ZF\none can easily prove that all these sets exist. See the\n Supplement on Basic Set Theory\n for further discussion.\n3. The theory of transfinite ordinals and cardinals\n\nIn ZFC one can develop the Cantorian theory of transfinite (i.e.,\ninfinite) ordinal and cardinal numbers. Following the definition given\nby Von Neumann in the early 1920s, the ordinal numbers, or\nordinals, for short, are obtained by starting with the empty\nset and performing two operations: taking the immediate successor, and\npassing to the limit. Thus, the first ordinal number is\n\\({\\varnothing}\\). Given an ordinal \\(\\alpha\\), its immediate\nsuccessor, denoted by \\(\\alpha +1\\), is the set \\(\\alpha \\cup \\{\n\\alpha \\}\\). And given a non-empty set \\(X\\) of ordinals such that for\nevery \\(\\alpha \\in X\\) the successor \\(\\alpha +1\\) is also in \\(X\\),\none obtains the limit ordinal \\(\\bigcup X\\). One shows that\nevery ordinal is (strictly) well-ordered by \\(\\in\\), i.e., it is\nlinearly ordered by \\(\\in\\) and there is no infinite\n\\(\\in\\)-descending sequence. Also, every well-ordered set is\nisomorphic to a unique ordinal, called its order-type.\n\nNote that every ordinal is the set of its predecessors. However, the\nclass \\(ON\\) of all ordinals is not a set. Otherwise, \\(ON\\) would be\nan ordinal greater than all the ordinals, which is impossible. The\nfirst infinite ordinal, which is the set of all finite ordinals, is\ndenoted by the Greek letter omega (\\(\\omega\\)). In ZFC, one identifies\nthe finite ordinals with the natural numbers. Thus,\n\\({\\varnothing}=0\\), \\(\\{ {\\varnothing}\\}=1\\), \\(\\{ {\\varnothing}, \\{\n{\\varnothing}\\}\\}=2\\), etc., hence \\(\\omega\\) is just the set\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers.\n\nOne can extend the operations of addition and multiplication of\nnatural numbers to all the ordinals. For example, the ordinal \\(\\alpha\n+\\beta\\) is the order-type of the well-ordering obtained by\nconcatenating a well-ordered set of order-type \\(\\alpha\\) and a\nwell-ordered set of order-type \\(\\beta\\). The sequence of ordinals,\nwell-ordered by \\(\\in\\), starts as follows\n\n\n0, 1, 2,\u2026, \\(n\\),\u2026, \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega+1\\),\n\\(\\omega+2\\),\u2026, \\(\\omega +\\omega\\),\u2026, \\(\\omega \\cdot\nn\\), \u2026, \\(\\omega \\cdot \\omega\\),\u2026, \\(\\omega^n\\),\n\u2026, \\(\\omega^\\omega\\), \u2026\n\n\nThe ordinals satisfy the principle of transfinite induction:\nsuppose that \\(C\\) is a class of ordinals such that whenever \\(C\\)\ncontains all ordinals \\(\\beta\\) smaller than some ordinal \\(\\alpha\\),\nthen \\(\\alpha\\) is also in \\(C\\). Then the class \\(C\\) contains all\nordinals. Using transfinite induction one can prove in ZFC (and one\nneeds the axiom of Replacement) the important principle of\ntransfinite recursion, which says that, given any definable\nclass-function \\(G\\) (namely a definable operation that takes any set\n\\(x\\) to a set \\(G(x)\\)), one can define a class-function \\(F\\) with\ndomain the class \\(ON\\) of ordinals, such that \\(F(\\alpha)\\) is the\nvalue of the function \\(G\\) applied to the function \\(F\\) restricted\nto \\(\\alpha\\). One uses transfinite recursion, for example, in order\nto define properly the arithmetical operations of addition, product,\nand exponentiation on the ordinals.\n\nRecall that an infinite set is countable if it is bijectable,\ni.e., it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence, with \\(\\omega\\).\nAll the ordinals displayed above are either finite or countable. But\nthe set of all finite and countable ordinals is also an ordinal,\ncalled \\(\\omega_1\\), and is not countable. Similarly, the set of all\nordinals that are bijectable with some ordinal less than or equal to\n\\(\\omega_1\\) is also an ordinal, called \\(\\omega_2\\), and is not\nbijectable with \\(\\omega_1\\), and so on.\n3.1 Cardinals\n\nA cardinal is an ordinal that is not bijectable with any\nsmaller ordinal. Thus, every finite ordinal is a cardinal, and\n\\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), etc. are also cardinals. The\ninfinite cardinals are represented by the letter aleph (\\(\\aleph\\)) of\nthe Hebrew alphabet, and their sequence is indexed by the ordinals. It\nstarts like this\n\n\n\\(\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\aleph_1\\), \\(\\aleph_2\\), \u2026, \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\),\n\\(\\aleph_{\\omega +1}\\), \u2026, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega +\\omega}\\),\n\u2026, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega^2}\\), \u2026, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega^\\omega}\\),\n\u2026, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\), \u2026, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_2}\\),\n\u2026\n\n\nThus, \\(\\omega=\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\omega_1=\\aleph_1\\),\n\\(\\omega_2=\\aleph_2\\), etc. For every cardinal there is a bigger one,\nand the limit of an increasing sequence of cardinals is also a\ncardinal. Thus, the class of all cardinals is not a set, but a proper\nclass.\n\nAn infinite cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is called regular if it is\nnot the union of less than \\(\\kappa\\) smaller cardinals. Thus,\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) is regular, and so are all infinite successor cardinals,\nsuch as \\(\\aleph_1\\). Non-regular infinite cardinals are called\nsingular. The first singular cardinal is \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\),\nas it is the union of countably-many smaller cardinals, namely\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega =\\bigcup \\{\\aleph_n : n<\\omega\\} \\).\n\nThe cofinality of a cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), denoted by\n\\(cf(\\kappa)\\) is the smallest cardinal \\(\\lambda\\) such that\n\\(\\kappa\\) is the union of \\(\\lambda\\)-many smaller ordinals. Thus,\n\\(cf(\\aleph_\\omega)=\\aleph_0\\).\n\nBy the AC (in the form of the Well-Ordering Principle), every set\n\\(A\\) can be well-ordered, hence it is bijectable with a unique\ncardinal, called the cardinality of \\(A\\). Given two\ncardinals \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\lambda\\), the sum \\(\\kappa +\\lambda\\) is\ndefined as the cardinality of the set consisting of the union of any\ntwo disjoint sets, one of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) and one of\ncardinality \\(\\lambda\\). And the product \\(\\kappa \\cdot \\lambda\\) is\ndefined as the cardinality of the Cartesian product \\(\\kappa \\times\n\\lambda\\). The operations of sum and product of infinite cardinals are\ntrivial, for if \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are infinite cardinals,\nthen \\(\\kappa +\\lambda =\\kappa \\cdot \\lambda = maximum \\{ \\kappa\n,\\lambda\\}\\).\n\nIn contrast, cardinal exponentiation is highly non-trivial, for even\nthe value of the simplest non-trivial infinite exponential, namely\n\\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), is not known and cannot be determined in ZFC (see\nbelow). The cardinal \\(\\kappa^\\lambda\\) is defined as the cardinality\nof the Cartesian product of \\(\\lambda\\) copies of \\(\\kappa\\);\nequivalently, as the cardinality of the set of all functions from\n\\(\\lambda\\) into \\(\\kappa\\). K\u00f6nig\u2019s theorem asserts that\n\\(\\kappa^{cf(\\kappa)}>\\kappa\\), which implies that the cofinality\nof the cardinal \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), whatever that cardinal is, must be\nuncountable. But this is essentially all that ZFC can prove about the\nvalue of the exponential \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\).\n\nIn the case of exponentiation of singular cardinals, ZFC has a lot\nmore to say. In 1989, Shelah proved the remarkable result that if\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega\\) is a strong limit, that is,\n\\(2^{\\aleph_n}<\\aleph_\\omega\\), for every \\(n<\\omega\\), then\n\\(2^{\\aleph_\\omega}<\\aleph_{\\omega_4}\\) (see Shelah (1994)). The\ntechnique developed by Shelah to prove this and similar theorems, in\nZFC, is called pcf theory (for possible\ncofinalities), and has found many applications in other areas of\nmathematics.\n4. The universe \\(V\\) of all sets\n\nA posteriori, the ZF axioms other than\nExtensionality\u2014which needs no justification because it just\nstates a defining property of sets\u2014may be justified by their use\nin building the cumulative hierarchy of sets. Namely, in ZF\nwe define using transfinite recursion the class-function that assigns\nto each ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) the set \\(V_\\alpha\\), given as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(V_0={\\varnothing}\\)\n\n\n\\(V_{\\alpha +1}=\\mathcal{P}(V_\\alpha)\\)\n\n\n\\(V_\\alpha =\\bigcup \\{ V_\\beta : \\beta <\\alpha \\}\\), whenever\n\\(\\alpha\\) is a limit ordinal.\n\n\nThe Power Set axiom is used to obtain \\(V_{\\alpha +1}\\) from\n\\(V_\\alpha\\). Replacement and Union allow one to form \\(V_\\alpha\\) for\n\\(\\alpha\\) a limit ordinal. Indeed, consider the function that assigns\nto each \\(\\beta <\\alpha\\) the set \\(V_\\beta\\). By Replacement, the\ncollection of all the \\(V_\\beta\\), for \\(\\beta <\\alpha\\), is a set,\nhence the Union axiom applied to that set yields \\(V_\\alpha\\). The\naxiom of Infinity is needed to prove the existence of \\(\\omega\\) and\nhence of the transfinite sequence of ordinals. Finally, the axiom of\nFoundation is equivalent, assuming the other axioms, to the statement\nthat every set belongs to some \\(V_\\alpha\\), for some ordinal\n\\(\\alpha\\). Thus, ZF proves that the set theoretic universe, denoted\nby \\(V\\), is the union of all the \\(V_\\alpha\\), \\(\\alpha\\) an\nordinal.\n\nThe proper class \\(V\\), together with the \\(\\in\\) relation, satisfies\nall the ZFC axioms, and is thus a model of ZFC. It is the intended\nmodel of ZFC, and one may think of ZFC as providing a description of\n\\(V\\), a description however that is highly incomplete, as we shall\nsee below.\n\nOne important property of \\(V\\) is the so-called Reflection\nPrinciple. Namely, for each formula \\(\\varphi(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\),\nZFC proves that there exists some \\(V_\\alpha\\) that reflects it, that\nis, for every \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\in V_\\alpha\\),\n\n\n\\(\\varphi(a_1,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) holds in \\(V\\) if and only if\n\\(\\varphi(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\) holds in \\(V_\\alpha\\).\n\n\nThus, \\(V\\) cannot be characterized by any sentence, as any sentence\nthat is true in \\(V\\) must be also true in some initial segment\n\\(V_\\alpha\\). In particular, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, for\notherwise ZFC would prove that, for unboundedly many ordinals\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(V_\\alpha\\) is a model of ZFC, contradicting\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem (see\n Section 5.2).\n\nThe Reflection Principle encapsulates the essence of ZF set theory,\nfor as shown by Levy (1960), the axioms of Extensionality, Separation,\nand Foundation, together with the Reflection Principle, formulated as\nthe axiom schema asserting that each formula is reflected by some set\nthat contains all elements and all subsets of its elements (note that\nthe \\(V_\\alpha\\) are like this), is equivalent to ZF.\n5. Set theory as the foundation of mathematics\n\nEvery mathematical object may be viewed as a set. For example, the\nnatural numbers are identified with the finite ordinals, so\n\\(\\mathbb{N}=\\omega\\). The set of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) may be\ndefined as the set of equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers\nunder the equivalence relation \\((n, m)\\equiv (n',m')\\) if and only if\n\\(n+m'=m+n'\\). By identifying every natural number \\(n\\) with the\nequivalence class of the pair \\((n,0)\\), one may extend naturally the\noperations of sum and product of natural numbers to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n(see Enderton (1977) for details, and Levy (1979) for a different\nconstruction). Further, one may define the rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) as\nthe set of equivalence classes of pairs \\((n,m)\\) of integers, where\n\\(m\\ne 0\\), under the equivalence relation \\((n,m)\\equiv (n',m')\\) if\nand only if \\(n\\cdot m'=m\\cdot n'\\). Again, the operations \\(+\\) and\n\\(\\cdot\\) on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) may be extended naturally to\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Moreover, the ordering \\(\\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\) on the\nrationals is given by: \\(r \\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}} s\\) if and only if there\nexists \\(t\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(s=r+t\\). The real numbers may\nbe defined as Dedekind cuts of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), namely, a real number\nis given by a pair \\((A,B)\\) of non-empty disjoint sets such that\n\\(A\\cup B=\\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(A\\) has no greatest element, and \\(a\n\\lt_{\\mathbb{Q}} b\\) for every \\(a\\in A\\) and \\(b\\in B\\). One can then\nextend again the operations of \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\) on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\),\nas well as the ordering \\(\\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\), to the set of real\nnumbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nLet us emphasize that it is not claimed that, e.g., real numbers\nare Dedekind cuts of rationals, as they could also be defined\nusing Cauchy sequences, or in other different ways. What is important,\nfrom a foundational point of view, is that the set-theoretic version\nof \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), together with the usual algebraic operations,\nsatisfies the categorical axioms that the real numbers satisfy, namely\nthose of a complete ordered field. The metaphysical question of what\nthe real numbers really are is irrelevant here.\n\nAlgebraic structures can also be viewed as sets, as any \\(n\\)-ary\nrelation on the elements of a set \\(A\\) can be viewed as a set of\nordered \\(n\\)-tuples \\((a_1,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) of elements of \\(A\\). And\nany \\(n\\)-ary function \\(f\\) on \\(A\\), with values on some set \\(B\\),\ncan be seen as the set of ordered \\(n+1\\)-tuples \\(((a_1,\\ldots\n,a_n),b)\\) such that \\(b\\) is the value of \\(f\\) on \\((a_1,\\ldots\n,a_m)\\). Thus, for example, a group is just a triple \\((A, +,\n0)\\), where \\(A\\) is a non-empty set, \\(+\\) is a binary function on\n\\(A\\) that is associative, \\(0\\) is an element of \\(A\\) such that\n\\(a+0=0+a=a\\), for all \\(a\\in A\\), and for every \\(a\\in A\\) there is\nan element of \\(A\\), denoted by \\(-a\\), such that \\(a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0\\).\nAlso, a topological space is just a set \\(X\\) together with a\ntopology \\(\\tau\\) on it, i.e., \\(\\tau\\) is a subset of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(X)\\) containing \\(X\\) and \\({\\varnothing}\\), and closed\nunder arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Any mathematical\nobject whatsoever can always be viewed as a set, or a proper class.\nThe properties of the object can then be expressed in the language of\nset theory. Any mathematical statement can be formalized into the\nlanguage of set theory, and any mathematical theorem can be derived,\nusing the calculus of first-order logic, from the axioms of ZFC, or\nfrom some extension of ZFC. It is in this sense that set theory\nprovides a foundation for mathematics.\n\nThe foundational role of set theory for mathematics, while\nsignificant, is by no means the only justification for its study. The\nideas and techniques developed within set theory, such as infinite\ncombinatorics, forcing, or the theory of large cardinals, have turned\nit into a deep and fascinating mathematical theory, worthy of study by\nitself, and with important applications to practically all areas of\nmathematics.\n5.1 Metamathematics\n\nThe remarkable fact that virtually all of mathematics can be\nformalized within ZFC, makes possible a mathematical study of\nmathematics itself. Thus, any questions about the existence of some\nmathematical object, or the provability of a conjecture or hypothesis\ncan be given a mathematically precise formulation. This makes\nmetamathematics possible, namely the mathematical study of\nmathematics itself. So, the question about the provability or\nunprovability of any given mathematical statement becomes a sensible\nmathematical question. When faced with an open mathematical problem or\nconjecture, it makes sense to ask for its provability or unprovability\nin the ZFC formal system. Unfortunately, the answer may be neither,\nbecause ZFC, if consistent, is incomplete.\n5.2 The incompleteness phenomenon\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem for first-order logic implies\nthat ZFC is consistent\u2014i.e., no contradiction can be\nderived from it\u2014if and only if it has a model. A model\nof ZFC is a pair \\((M,E)\\), where \\(M\\) is a non-empty set and \\(E\\)\nis a binary relation on \\(M\\) such that all the axioms of ZFC are true\nwhen interpreted in \\((M,E)\\), i.e., when the variables that appear in\nthe axioms range over elements of \\(M\\), and \\(\\in\\) is interpreted as\n\\(E\\). Thus, if \\(\\varphi\\) is a sentence of the language of set\ntheory and one can find a model of ZFC in which \\(\\varphi\\) holds,\nthen its negation \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) cannot be proved in ZFC. Hence, if\none can find a model of \\(\\varphi\\) and also a model of \\(\\neg\n\\varphi\\), then \\(\\varphi\\) is neither provable nor disprovable in\nZFC, in which case we say that \\(\\varphi\\) is undecidable in,\nor independent of, ZFC.\n\nIn 1931, G\u00f6del announced his striking incompleteness theorems,\nwhich assert that any reasonable formal system for mathematics is\nnecessarily incomplete. In particular, if ZFC is consistent, then\nthere are propositions in the language of set theory that are\nundecidable in ZFC. Moreover, G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness\ntheorem implies that the formal (arithmetical) statement \\(CON(ZFC)\\),\nwhich asserts that ZFC is consistent, while true, cannot be proved in\nZFC. And neither can its negation. Thus, \\(CON(ZFC)\\) is undecidable\nin ZFC.\n\nIf ZFC is consistent, then it cannot prove the existence of a model of\nZFC, for otherwise ZFC would prove its own consistency. Thus, a proof\nof consistency or of undecidability of a given sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is\nalways a relative consistency proof. That is, one assumes\nthat ZFC is consistent, hence it has a model, and then one constructs\nanother model of ZFC where the sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is true. We shall\nsee several examples in the next sections.\n6. The set theory of the continuum\n\nFrom Cantor and until about 1940, set theory developed mostly around\nthe study of the continuum, that is, the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The\nmain topic was the study of the so-called regularity properties, as\nwell as other structural properties, of simply-definable sets of real\nnumbers, an area of mathematics that is known as Descriptive Set\nTheory.\n6.1 Descriptive Set Theory\n\nDescriptive Set Theory is the study of the properties and structure of\ndefinable sets of real numbers and, more generally, of definable\nsubsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and other Polish spaces (i.e.,\ntopological spaces that are homeomorphic to a separable complete\nmetric space), such as the Baire space \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) of all\nfunctions \\(f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\), the space of complex\nnumbers, Hilbert space, and separable Banach spaces. The simplest sets\nof real numbers are the basic open sets (i.e., the open intervals with\nrational endpoints), and their complements. The sets that are obtained\nin a countable number of steps by starting from the basic open sets\nand applying the operations of taking the complement and forming a\ncountable union of previously obtained sets are the Borel\nsets. All Borel sets are regular, that is, they enjoy\nall the classical regularity properties. One example of a\nregularity property is the Lebesgue measurability: a set of\nreals is Lebesgue measurable if it differs from a Borel set by a null\nset, namely, a set that can be covered by sets of basic open intervals\nof arbitrarily-small total length. Thus, trivially, every Borel set is\nLebesgue measurable, but sets more complicated than the Borel ones may\nnot be. Other classical regularity properties are the Baire\nproperty (a set of reals has the Baire property if it differs\nfrom an open set by a meager set, namely, a set that is a countable\nunion of sets that are not dense in any interval), and the perfect\nset property (a set of reals has the perfect set property if it\nis either countable or contains a perfect set, namely, a nonempty\nclosed set with no isolated points). In ZFC one can prove that there\nexist non-regular sets of reals, but the AC is necessary for this\n(Solovay 1970).\n\nThe analytic sets, also called \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_1\\), are\nthe continuous images of Borel sets. And the co-analytic, or\n\\(\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_1\\), sets are the complements of analytic sets.\n\nStarting from the analytic (or the co-analytic) sets and applying the\noperations of projection (from the product space \\(\\mathbb{R}\\times\n\\mathcal{N}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) and complementation, one obtains the\nprojective sets. The projective sets form a hierarchy of\nincreasing complexity. For example, if \\(A\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\times\n\\mathcal{N}\\) is co-analytic, then the projection \\(\\{ x\\in\n\\mathbb{R}: \\exists y\\in \\mathcal{N}((x,y)\\in A)\\}\\) is a projective\nset in the next level of complexity above the co-analytic sets. Those\nsets are called \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\), and their complements are\ncalled \\(\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_2\\).\n\nThe projective sets come up very naturally in mathematical practice,\nfor it turns out that a set \\(A\\) of reals is projective if and only\nif it is definable in the structure\n\n\n\\[\\mathcal{R}=(\\mathbb{R}, +,\\cdot ,\\mathbb{Z}).\\]\n\n\nThat is, there is a first-order formula \\(\\varphi ( x, y_1,\\ldots,\ny_n)\\) in the language for the structure such that for some\n\\(r_1,\\ldots ,r_n\\in \\mathbb{R}\\),\n\n\n\\[A=\\{ x\\in \\mathbb{R}: \\mathcal{R}\\models \\varphi(x,r_1,\\ldots\n,r_n)\\}.\\]\n\n\nZFC proves that every analytic set, and therefore every co-analytic\nset, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also proves\nthat every analytic set has the perfect set property. But the perfect\nset property for co-analytic sets implies that the first uncountable\ncardinal, \\(\\aleph_1\\), is a large cardinal in the constructible\nuniverse \\(L\\) (see\n Section 7),\n namely a so-called inaccessible cardinal (see\n Section 10),\n which implies that one cannot prove in ZFC that every co-analytic set\nhas the perfect set property.\n\nThe theory of projective sets of complexity greater than co-analytic\nis completely undetermined by ZFC. For example, in \\(L\\) there is a\n\\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) set that is not Lebesgue measurable and does\nnot have the Baire property, whereas if Martin\u2019s axiom holds\n(see\n Section 11),\n every such set has those regularity properties. There is, however, an\naxiom, called the axiom of Projective Determinacy, or PD, that is\nconsistent with ZFC, modulo the consistency of some large cardinals\n(in fact, it follows from the existence of some large cardinals), and\nimplies that all projective sets are regular. Moreover, PD settles\nessentially all questions about the projective sets. See the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for further details.\n6.2 Determinacy\n\nA regularity property of sets that subsumes all other classical\nregularity properties is that of being determined. For\nsimplicity, we shall work with the Baire space \\(\\mathcal{N}\\). Recall\nthat the elements of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) are functions \\(f:\\mathbb{N} \\to\n\\mathbb{N}\\), that is, sequences of natural numbers of length\n\\(\\omega\\). The space \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is topologically equivalent\n(i.e., homeomorphic) to the set of irrational points of\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\). So, since we are interested in the regularity\nproperties of subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), and since countable sets,\nsuch as the set of rationals, are negligible in terms of those\nproperties, we may as well work with \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), instead of\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nGiven \\(A\\subseteq \\mathcal{N}\\), the game associated to\n\\(A\\), denoted by \\({\\mathcal G}_A\\), has two players, I and II, who\nplay alternatively \\(n_i\\in \\mathbb{N}\\): I plays \\(n_0\\), then II\nplays \\(n_1\\), then I plays \\(n_2\\), and so on. So, at stage \\(2k\\),\nplayer I plays \\(n_{2k}\\) and at stage \\(2k+1\\), player II plays\n\\(n_{2k+1} \\). We may visualize a run of the game as follows:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{I}\\)\n\\(n_0\\)\n\n\\(n_2\\)\n\n\\(n_4\\)\n\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\\(n_{2k}\\)\n\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n \n\n\\(\\mathbf{II}\\)\n\n\\(n_1\\)\n\n\\(n_3\\)\n\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\\(n_{2k+1}\\)\n\n\\(\\cdots\\) \n\n\nAfter infinitely many moves, the two players produce an infinite\nsequence \\(n_0, n_1,n_2,\\ldots\\) of natural numbers. Player I wins the\ngame if the sequence belongs to \\(A\\). Otherwise, player II wins.\n\nThe game \\({\\mathcal{G}}_A\\) is determined if there is a\nwinning strategy for one of the players. A winning strategy\nfor one of the players, say for player II, is a function \\(\\sigma\\)\nfrom the set of finite sequences of natural numbers into\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\), such that if the player plays according to this\nfunction, i.e., she plays \\(\\sigma (n_0,\\ldots ,n_{2k})\\) at the\n\\(k\\)-th turn, she will always win the game, no matter what the other\nplayer does.\n\nWe say that a subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is determined\nif and only if the game \\({\\mathcal{G}}_A\\) is determined.\n\nOne can prove in ZFC\u2014and the use of the AC is\nnecessary\u2014that there are non-determined sets. Thus, the\nAxiom of Determinacy (AD), which asserts that all subsets of\n\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) are determined, is incompatible with the AC. But\nDonald Martin proved, in ZFC, that every Borel set is determined.\nFurther, he showed that if there exists a large cardinal called\nmeasurable (see\n Section 10),\n then even the analytic sets are determined. The axiom of\nProjective Determinacy (PD) asserts that every projective set\nis determined. It turns out that PD implies that all projective sets\nof reals are regular, and Woodin has shown that, in a certain sense,\nPD settles essentially all questions about the projective sets.\nMoreover, PD seems to be necessary for this. Another axiom,\n\\(AD^{L(\\Bbb R )}\\), asserts that the AD holds in \\(L(\\Bbb R)\\), which\nis the least transitive class that contains all the ordinals and all\nthe real numbers, and satisfies the ZF axioms (see\n Section 7).\n So, \\(AD^{L(\\Bbb R )}\\) implies that every set of reals that belongs\nto \\(L(\\Bbb R)\\) is regular. Also, since \\(L(\\Bbb R)\\) contains all\nprojective sets, \\(AD^{L(\\Bbb R )}\\) implies PD.\n6.3 The Continuum Hypothesis\n\nThe Continuum Hypothesis (CH), formulated by Cantor in 1878, asserts\nthat every infinite set of real numbers has cardinality either\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) or the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Thus, the CH\nis equivalent to \\(2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_1\\).\n\nCantor proved in 1883 that closed sets of real numbers have the\nperfect set property, from which it follows that every uncountable\nclosed set of real numbers has the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nThus, the CH holds for closed sets. More than thirty years later,\nPavel Aleksandrov extended the result to all Borel sets, and then\nMikhail Suslin to all analytic sets. Thus, all analytic sets satisfy\nthe CH. However, the efforts to prove that co-analytic sets satisfy\nthe CH would not succeed, as this is not provable in ZFC.\n\nIn 1938 G\u00f6del proved the consistency of the CH with ZFC. Assuming\nthat ZF is consistent, he built a model of ZFC, known as the\nconstructible universe, in which the CH holds. Thus, the\nproof shows that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF together with the\nAC and the CH. Hence, assuming ZF is consistent, the AC cannot be\ndisproved in ZF and the CH cannot be disproved in ZFC.\n\nSee the entry on the\n continuum hypothesis\n for the current status of the problem.\n7. G\u00f6del\u2019s constructible universe\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s constructible universe, denoted by \\(L\\), is\ndefined by transfinite recursion on the ordinals, similarly as \\(V\\),\nbut at successor steps, instead of taking the power set of\n\\(V_\\alpha\\) to obtain \\(V_{\\alpha +1}\\), one only takes the set of\nthose subsets of \\(L_\\alpha\\) that are definable in \\(L_\\alpha\\),\nusing elements of \\(L_\\alpha\\) as parameters. Thus, letting\n\\(\\mathcal{P}^{Def}(X)\\) to denote the set of all the subsets of \\(X\\)\nthat are definable in the structure \\((X,\\in )\\) by a formula of the\nlanguage of set theory, using elements of \\(X\\) as parameters of the\ndefinition, we let\n\n\n\n\\(L_0={\\varnothing}\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{\\alpha +1}=\\mathcal{P}^{Def}(L_\\alpha)\\)\n\n\n\\(L_\\lambda =\\bigcup \\{L_\\alpha :\\alpha <\\lambda\\}\\), whenever\n\\(\\lambda\\) is a limit ordinal.\n\n\nThen \\(L\\) is the union of all the \\(L_\\alpha\\), for \\(\\alpha\\) an\nordinal.\n\nG\u00f6del showed that \\(L\\) satisfies all the ZFC axioms, and also\nthe CH. In fact, it satisfies the Generalized Continuum\nHypothesis (GCH), namely \\(2^{\\aleph_\\alpha}=\\aleph_{\\alpha\n+1}\\), for every ordinal \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nThe statement \\(V=L\\), called the axiom of constructibility,\nasserts that every set belongs to \\(L\\). It holds in \\(L\\), hence it\nis consistent with ZFC, and implies both the AC and the GCH.\n\nThe proper class \\(L\\), together with the \\(\\in\\) relation restricted\nto \\(L\\), is an inner model of ZFC, that is, a\ntransitive (i.e., it contains all elements of its elements)\nclass that contains all ordinals and satisfies all the ZFC axioms. It\nis in fact the smallest inner model of ZFC, as any other inner model\ncontains it.\n\nMore generally, given any set \\(A\\), one can build the smallest\ntransitive model of ZF that contains \\(A\\) and all the ordinals in a\nsimilar manner as \\(L\\), but now starting with the transitive closure\nof \\(\\{A \\}\\), i.e., the smallest transitive set that contains \\(A\\),\ninstead of \\({\\varnothing}\\). The resulting model, \\(L(A)\\), need not\nbe however a model of the AC. One very important such model is\n\\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), the smallest transitive model of ZF that contains\nall the ordinals and all the real numbers.\n\nThe theory of constructible sets owes much to the work of Ronald\nJensen. He developed the so-called fine structure theory of\n\\(L\\) and isolated some combinatorial principles, such as the diamond\n(\\(\\diamondsuit\\)) and square (\\(\\Box\\)), which can be used to carry\nout complicated constructions of uncountable mathematical objects.\nFine structure theory plays also an important role in the analysis of\nbigger \\(L\\)-like models, such as \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) or the inner\nmodels for large cardinals (see\n Section 10.1).\n8. Forcing\n\nIn 1963, twenty-five years after G\u00f6del\u2019s proof of the\nconsistency of the CH and the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF,\nPaul Cohen (1966) proved the consistency of the negation of the CH,\nand also of the negation of the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF.\nThus, if ZF is consistent, then the CH is undecidable in ZFC, and the\nAC is undecidable in ZF. To achieve this, Cohen devised a new and\nextremely powerful technique, called forcing, for expanding\ncountable transitive models of ZF, or of ZFC.\n\nSince the axiom \\(V=L\\) implies the AC and the CH, any model of the\nnegation of the AC or the CH must violate \\(V=L\\). So, let\u2019s\nillustrate the idea of forcing in the case of building a model for the\nnegation of \\(V=L\\). We start with a transitive model \\(M\\) of ZFC,\nwhich we may assume, without loss of generality, to be a model of\n\\(V=L\\). To violate \\(V=L\\) we need to expand \\(M\\) by adding a new\nset \\(r\\) so that, in the expanded model, \\(r\\) will be\nnon-constructible. Since all hereditarily-finite sets are\nconstructible, we aim to add an infinite set of natural numbers. The\nfirst problem we face is that \\(M\\) may contain already all subsets of\n\\(\\omega\\). Fortunately, by the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem for\nfirst-order logic, \\(M\\) has an elementary submodel which is\nisomorphic to a countable transitive model \\(N\\). So, since we are\nonly interested in the statements that hold in \\(M\\), and not in \\(M\\)\nitself, we may as well work with \\(N\\) instead of \\(M\\), and so we may\nassume that \\(M\\) itself is countable. Then, since\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega)\\) is uncountable, there are plenty of subsets of\n\\(\\omega\\) that do not belong to \\(M\\). But, unfortunately, we cannot\njust pick any infinite subset \\(r\\) of \\(\\omega\\) that does not belong\nto \\(M\\) and add it to \\(M\\). The reason is that \\(r\\) may encode a\nlot of information, so that when added to \\(M\\), \\(M\\) is no longer a\nmodel of ZF, or it is still a model of \\(V=L\\). To avoid this, one\nneeds to pick \\(r\\) with great care. The idea is to pick \\(r\\)\ngeneric over \\(M\\), meaning that \\(r\\) is built from its\nfinite approximations in such a way that it does not have any property\nthat is definable in \\(M\\) and can be avoided. For example, by viewing\n\\(r\\) as an infinite sequence of natural numbers in the increasing\norder, the property of \\(r\\) containing only finitely-many even\nnumbers can be avoided, because given any finite approximation to\n\\(r\\)\u2014i.e., any finite increasing sequence of natural\nnumbers\u2014one can always extend it by adding more even numbers, so\nthat at the end of the construction \\(r\\) will contain infinitely-many\neven numbers; while the property of containing the number 7 cannot be\navoided, because when a finite approximation to \\(r\\) contains the\nnumber 7, then it stays there no matter how the construction of \\(r\\)\nproceeds. Since \\(M\\) is countable, there are such generic \\(r\\). Then\nthe expanded model \\(M[r]\\), which includes \\(M\\) and contains the new\nset \\(r\\), is called a generic extension of \\(M\\). Since we\nassumed \\(M\\) is a transitive model of \\(V=L\\), the model \\(M[r]\\) is\njust \\(L_\\alpha (r)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the supremum of the\nordinals of \\(M\\). Then one can show, using the forcing\nrelation between finite approximations to \\(r\\) and formulas in the\nlanguage of set theory expanded with so-called names for sets\nin the generic extension, that \\(M[r]\\) is a model of ZFC and \\(r\\) is\nnot constructible in \\(M[r]\\), hence the axiom of constructibility\n\\(V=L\\) fails.\n\nIn general, a forcing extension of a model \\(M\\) is obtained by adding\nto \\(M\\) a generic subset \\(G\\) of some partially ordered set\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) that belongs to \\(M\\). In the above example,\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) would be the set of all finite increasing sequences of\nnatural numbers, seen as finite approximations to the infinite\nsequence \\(r\\), ordered by \\(\\subseteq\\); and \\(G\\) would be the set\nof all finite initial segments of \\(r\\).\n\nIn the case of the consistency proof of the negation of the CH, one\nstarts from a model \\(M\\) of ZFC, as before, and adds \\(\\aleph_2\\) new\nsubsets of \\(\\omega\\), so that in the generic extension the CH fails.\nIn this case one needs to use an appropriate partial ordering\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) so that the \\(\\aleph_2\\) of \\(M\\) is not\ncollapsed, i.e., it is the same as the \\(\\aleph_2\\) of the\ngeneric extension, and thus the generic extension \\(M[G]\\) will\nsatisfy the sentence that says that there are \\(\\aleph_2\\) real\nnumbers.\n8.1 Other applications of forcing\n\nBesides the CH, many other mathematical conjectures and problems about\nthe continuum, and other infinite mathematical objects, have been\nshown undecidable in ZFC using the forcing technique.\n\nOne important example is Suslin\u2019s Hypothesis (SH).\nCantor had shown that every linearly ordered set \\(S\\) without\nendpoints that is dense (i.e., between any two different elements of\n\\(S\\) there is another one), complete (i.e., every subset of \\(S\\)\nthat is bounded above has a supremum), and with a countable dense\nsubset is isomorphic to the real line. Suslin conjectured that this is\nstill true if one relaxes the requirement of containing a countable\ndense subset to being ccc, i.e., every collection of\npairwise-disjoint intervals is countable. In the early 1970s, Thomas\nJech produced a consistent counterexample using forcing, and Ronald\nJensen showed that a counterexample exists in \\(L\\). About the same\ntime, Robert Solovay and Stanley Tennenbaum (1971) developed and used\nfor the first time the iterated forcing technique to produce a model\nwhere the SH holds, thus showing its independence from ZFC. In order\nto make sure that the SH holds in the generic extension, one needs to\ndestroy all counterexamples, but by destroying one particular\ncounterexample one may inadvertently create new ones, and so one needs\nto force again and again; in fact one needs to go on for at least\n\\(\\omega_2\\)-many steps. This is why a forcing iteration is\nneeded.\n\nAmong other famous mathematical problems that have been shown\nundecidable in ZFC thanks to the forcing technique, especially using\niterated forcing and sometimes combined with large cardinals, we may\nmention the Measure Problem and the Borel Conjecture in measure\ntheory, Kaplansky\u2019s Conjecture on Banach algebras, and\nWhitehead\u2019s Problem in group theory.\n9. The search for new axioms\n\nAs a result of 60 years of development of the forcing technique, and\nits applications to many open problems in mathematics, there are now\nliterally hundreds of problems and questions, in practically all areas\nof mathematics, that have been shown independent of ZFC. These include\nalmost all important questions about the structure of uncountable\nsets. One might say that the undecidability phenomenon is pervasive,\nto the point that the investigation of the uncountable has been\nrendered nearly impossible in ZFC alone (see however Shelah (1994) for\nremarkable exceptions).\n\nThis prompts the question about the truth-value of the statements that\nare undecided by ZFC. Should one be content with them being\nundecidable? Does it make sense at all to ask for their truth-value?\nThere are several possible reactions to this. One is the\nskeptic\u2019s position: the statements that are undecidable in ZFC\nhave no definite answer; and they may even be inherently vague.\nAnother, the common one among mathematicians, is G\u00f6del\u2019s\nposition: the undecidability only shows that the ZFC system is too\nweak to answer those questions, and therefore one should search for\nnew axioms that once added to ZFC would answer them. The search for\nnew axioms has been known as G\u00f6del\u2019s Program. See\nHauser (2006) for a thorough philosophical discussion of the Program,\nand also the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for philosophical considerations on the justification of new axioms\nfor set theory.\n\nA central theme of set theory is thus the search and classification of\nnew axioms. These fall currently into two main types: the axioms of\nlarge cardinals and the forcing axioms.\n10. Large cardinals\n\nOne cannot prove in ZFC that there exists a regular limit cardinal\n\\(\\kappa\\), for if \\(\\kappa\\) is such a cardinal, then \\(L_\\kappa\\) is\na model of ZFC, and so ZFC would prove its own consistency,\ncontradicting G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem. Thus,\nthe existence of a regular limit cardinal must be postulated as a new\naxiom. Such a cardinal is called weakly inaccessible. If, in\naddition \\(\\kappa\\) is a strong limit, i.e., \\(2^\\lambda <\\kappa\\),\nfor every cardinal \\(\\lambda <\\kappa\\), then \\(\\kappa\\) is called\nstrongly inaccessible. A cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is strongly\ninaccessible if and only if it is regular and \\(V_\\kappa \\) is a model\nof ZFC. If the GCH holds, then every weakly inaccessible cardinal is\nstrongly inaccessible.\n\nLarge cardinals are uncountable cardinals satisfying some properties\nthat make them very large, and whose existence cannot be proved in\nZFC. The first weakly inaccessible cardinal is just the smallest of\nall large cardinals. Beyond inaccessible cardinals there is a rich and\ncomplex variety of large cardinals, which form a linear hierarchy in\nterms of consistency strength, and in many cases also in terms of\noutright implication. See the entry on\n independence and large cardinals\n for more details.\n\nTo formulate the next stronger large-cardinal notion, let us say that\na subset \\(C\\) of an infinite cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is closed\nif every limit of elements of \\(C\\) which is less than \\(\\kappa\\) is\nalso in \\(C\\); and is unbounded if for every \\(\\alpha\n<\\kappa\\) there exists \\(\\beta\\in C\\) greater than \\(\\alpha\\). For\nexample, the set of limit ordinals less than \\(\\kappa\\) is closed and\nunbounded. Also, a subset \\(S\\) of \\(\\kappa\\) is called\nstationary if it intersects every closed unbounded subset of\n\\(\\kappa\\). If \\(\\kappa\\) is regular and uncountable, then the set of\nall ordinals less than \\(\\kappa\\) of cofinality \\(\\omega\\) is an\nexample of a stationary set. A regular cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is called\nMahlo if the set of strongly inaccessible cardinals smaller\nthan \\(\\kappa\\) is stationary. Thus, the first Mahlo cardinal is much\nlarger than the first strongly inaccessible cardinal, as there are\n\\(\\kappa\\)-many strongly inaccessible cardinals smaller than\n\\(\\kappa\\).\n\nMuch stronger large cardinal notions arise from considering strong\nreflection properties. Recall that the Reflection Principle\n (Section 4),\n which is provable in ZFC, asserts that every true sentence\n(i.e., every sentence that holds in \\(V\\)) is true in some\n\\(V_\\alpha\\). A strengthening of this principle to second-order\nsentences yields some large cardinals. For example, \\(\\kappa\\) is\nstrongly inaccessible if and only if every \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) sentence\n(i.e., existential second-order sentence in the language of set\ntheory, with one additional predicate symbol) true in any structure of\nthe form \\((V_\\kappa ,\\in, A)\\), where \\(A\\subseteq V_\\kappa\\), is\ntrue in some \\((V_\\alpha ,\\in ,A\\cap V_\\alpha)\\), with \\(\\alpha\n<\\kappa\\). The same type of reflection, but now for \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)\nsentences (i.e., universal second-order sentences), yields a much\nstronger large cardinal property of \\(\\kappa\\), called weak\ncompactness. Every weakly compact cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is Mahlo,\nand the set of Mahlo cardinals smaller than \\(\\kappa\\) is stationary.\nBy allowing reflection for more complex second-order, or even\nhigher-order, sentences one obtains large cardinal notions stronger\nthan weak compactness.\n\nThe most famous large cardinals, called measurable, were\ndiscovered by Stanis\u0142aw Ulam in 1930 as a result of his solution\nto the Measure Problem. A (two-valued) measure, or\nultrafilter, on a cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is a subset \\(U\\) of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(\\kappa)\\) that has the following properties: (i) the\nintersection of any two elements of \\(U\\) is in \\(U\\); (ii) if \\(X\\in\nU\\) and \\(Y\\) is a subset of \\(\\kappa\\) such that \\(X\\subseteq Y\\),\nthen \\(Y\\in U\\); and (iii) for every \\(X\\subseteq\\kappa\\), either\n\\(X\\in U\\) or \\(\\kappa -X\\in U\\), but not both. A measure \\(U\\) is\ncalled \\(\\kappa\\)-complete if every intersection of less than\n\\(\\kappa\\) elements of \\(U\\) is also in \\(U\\). And a measure is called\nnon-principal if there is no \\(\\alpha <\\kappa\\) that\nbelongs to all elements of \\(U\\). A cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is called\nmeasurable if there exists a measure on \\(\\kappa\\) that is\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete and non-principal.\n\nMeasurable cardinals can be characterized by elementary embeddings of\nthe universe \\(V\\) into some transitive class \\(M\\). That such an\nembedding \\(j:V\\to M\\) is elementary means that \\(j\\)\npreserves truth, i.e., for every formula \\(\\varphi (x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\)\nof the language of set theory, and every \\(a_1,\\ldots ,a_n\\), the\nsentence \\(\\varphi (a_1,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) holds in \\(V\\) if and only if\n\\(\\varphi (j(a_1),\\ldots ,j(a_n))\\) holds in \\(M\\). It turns out that\na cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable if and only if there exists an\nelementary embedding \\(j:V\\to M\\), with \\(M\\) transitive, so that\n\\(\\kappa\\) is the first ordinal moved by \\(j\\), i.e., the first\nordinal such that \\(j(\\kappa)\\ne \\kappa\\). We say that \\(\\kappa\\) is\nthe critical point of \\(j\\), and write \\(crit(j)=\\kappa\\).\nThe embedding \\(j\\) is definable from a \\(\\kappa\\)-complete\nnon-principal measure on \\(\\kappa\\), using the so-called\nultrapower construction. Conversely, if \\(j:V\\to M\\) is an\nelementary embedding, with \\(M\\) transitive and \\(\\kappa=crit(j)\\),\nthen the set \\(U=\\{ X\\subseteq \\kappa:\\kappa\\in j(X)\\}\\) is a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal ultrafilter on \\(\\kappa\\). A measure\n\\(U\\) obtained in this way from \\(j\\) is called normal.\n\nEvery measurable cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is weakly compact, and there are\nmany weakly compact cardinals smaller than \\(\\kappa\\). In fact, below\n\\(\\kappa\\) there are many cardinals that are totally\nindescribable, i.e., they reflect all sentences, of any\ncomplexity, and in any higher-order language.\n\nIf \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable and \\(j:V\\to M\\) is given by the\nultrapower construction, then \\(V_\\kappa \\subseteq M\\), and every\nsequence of length less than or equal to \\(\\kappa\\) of elements of\n\\(M\\) belongs to \\(M\\). Thus, \\(M\\) is quite similar to \\(V\\), but it\ncannot be \\(V\\) itself. Indeed, a famous theorem of Kenneth Kunen\nshows that there cannot be any elementary embedding \\(j:V\\to V\\),\nother than the trivial one, i.e., the identity. All known proofs of\nthis result use the Axiom of Choice, and it is an outstanding\nimportant question if the axiom is necessary. Kunen\u2019s Theorem\nopens the door to formulating large cardinal notions stronger than\nmeasurability by requiring that \\(M\\) is closer to \\(V\\).\n\nFor example, \\(\\kappa\\) is called strong if for every ordinal\n\\(\\alpha\\) there exists an elementary embedding \\(j:V\\to M\\), for some\n\\(M\\) transitive, such that \\(\\kappa =crit(j)\\) and \\(V_\\alpha\n\\subseteq M\\).\n\nAnother important, and much stronger large cardinal notion is\nsupercompactness. A cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is supercompact if\nfor every \\(\\alpha\\) there exists an elementary embedding \\(j:V\\to\nM\\), with \\(M\\) transitive and critical point \\(\\kappa\\), so that\n\\(j(\\kappa)>\\alpha\\) and every sequence of elements of \\(M\\) of\nlength \\(\\alpha\\) belongs to \\(M\\).\n\nWoodin cardinals fall between strong and supercompact. Every\nsupercompact cardinal is Woodin, and if \\(\\delta\\) is Woodin, then\n\\(V_\\delta\\) is a model of ZFC in which there is a proper class of\nstrong cardinals. Thus, while a Woodin cardinal \\(\\delta\\) need not be\nitself very strong\u2014the first one is not even weakly\ncompact\u2014it implies the existence of many large cardinals in\n\\(V_\\delta\\).\n\nBeyond supercompact cardinals we find the extendible\ncardinals, the huge, the super huge, etc.\n\nKunen\u2019s theorem about the non-existence of a non-trivial\nelementary embedding \\(j:V\\to V\\) actually shows that there cannot be\nan elementary embedding \\(j:V_{\\lambda +2}\\to V_{\\lambda +2}\\)\ndifferent from the identity, for any \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nThe strongest large cardinal notions not known to be inconsistent,\nmodulo ZFC, are the following:\n\n\n\nThere exists an elementary embedding \\(j:V_{\\lambda +1}\\to V_{\\lambda\n+1}\\) different from the identity.\n\n\nThere exists an elementary embedding \\(j:L(V_{\\lambda +1})\\to\nL(V_{\\lambda +1})\\) different from the identity.\n\n\nLarge cardinals form a linear hierarchy of increasing consistency\nstrength. In fact they are the stepping stones of the interpretability\nhierarchy of mathematical theories. See the entry on\n independence and large cardinals\n for more details. Typically, given any sentence \\(\\varphi\\) of the\nlanguage of set theory, exactly one the following three possibilities\nholds about the theory ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\):\n\n\n\nZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is inconsistent.\n\n\nZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is equiconsistent with ZFC (i.e., ZFC is\nconsistent if and only if so is ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\)).\n\n\nZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is equiconsistent with ZFC plus the existence of\nsome large cardinal.\n\n\nThus, large cardinals can be used to prove that a given sentence\n\\(\\varphi\\) does not imply another sentence \\(\\psi\\), modulo ZFC, by\nshowing that ZFC plus \\(\\psi\\) implies the consistency of some large\ncardinal, whereas ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is consistent assuming the\nexistence of a smaller large cardinal, or just assuming the\nconsistency of ZFC. In other words, \\(\\psi\\) has higher consistency\nstrength than \\(\\varphi\\), modulo ZFC. Then, by G\u00f6del\u2019s\nsecond incompleteness theorem, ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) cannot prove\n\\(\\psi\\), assuming ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is consistent.\n\nAs we already pointed out, one cannot prove in ZFC that large\ncardinals exist. But everything indicates that their existence not\nonly cannot be disproved, but in fact the assumption of their\nexistence is a very reasonable axiom of set theory. For one thing,\nthere is a lot of evidence for their consistency, especially for those\nlarge cardinals for which it is possible to construct a canonical\ninner model.\n10.1 Inner models of large cardinals\n\nAn inner model of ZFC is a transitive proper class that\ncontains all the ordinals and satisfies all ZFC axioms. Thus, \\(L\\) is\nthe smallest inner model, while \\(V\\) is the largest. Some large\ncardinals, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, or weakly-compact, may exist\nin \\(L\\). That is, if \\(\\kappa\\) has one of these large cardinal\nproperties, then it also has the property in \\(L\\). But some large\ncardinals cannot exist in \\(L\\). Indeed, Scott (1961) showed that if\nthere exists a measurable cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), then \\(V\\ne L\\). It is\nimportant to notice that \\(\\kappa\\) does belong to \\(L\\), since \\(L\\)\ncontains all ordinals, but it is not measurable in \\(L\\) because a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal measure on \\(\\kappa\\) cannot exist\nthere.\n\nIf \\(\\kappa\\) is a measurable cardinal, then one can construct an\n\\(L\\)-like model in which \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable by taking a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal and normal measure \\(U\\) on\n\\(\\kappa\\), and proceeding as in the definition of \\(L\\), but now\nusing \\(U\\) as an additional predicate. The resulting model, called\n\\(L[U]\\), is an inner model of ZFC in which \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable,\nand in fact \\(\\kappa\\) is the only measurable cardinal. The model is\ncanonical, in the sense that any other normal measure witnessing the\nmeasurability of \\(\\kappa\\) would yield the same model, and has many\nof the properties of \\(L\\). For instance, it has a projective well\nordering of the reals, and it satisfies the GCH.\n\nBuilding similar \\(L\\)-like models for stronger large cardinals, such\nas strong, or Woodin, is much harder. Those models are of the form\n\\(L[E]\\), where \\(E\\) is a sequence of extenders, each\nextender being a coherent system of measures, that encode the relevant\nelementary embeddings.\n\nThe largest \\(L\\)-like inner models for large cardinals that have been\nobtained so far can contain Woodin cardinals that are limits of Woodin\ncardinals (Neeman 2002). However, building an \\(L\\)-like model for a\nsupercompact cardinal is still a challenge. The supercompact barrier\nseems to be the crucial one, for Woodin has shown that for a natural\nkind of inner model for a supercompact cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), which he\ncalls a weak extender model for the supercompactness of \\( \\kappa\n\\), all stronger large cardinals greater than \\(\\kappa\\) that may\nexist in \\(V\\), such as extendible, huge, etc. would also exist in the\nmodel. \n10.2 Consequences of large cardinals\n\nThe existence of large cardinals has dramatic consequences, even for\nsimply-definable small sets, like the projective sets of real numbers.\nFor example, Solovay (1970) proved, assuming that there exists a\nmeasurable cardinal, that all \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) sets of reals\nare Lebesgue measurable and have the Baire property, which cannot be\nproved in ZFC alone. And Shelah and Woodin (1990) showed that the\nexistence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies that the\ntheory of \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), even with real numbers as parameters,\ncannot be changed by forcing, which implies that all sets of real\nnumbers that belong to \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) are regular. Further, under a\nweaker large-cardinal hypothesis, namely the existence of infinitely\nmany Woodin cardinals, Martin and Steel (1989) proved that every\nprojective set of real numbers is determined, i.e., the axiom of PD\nholds, hence all projective sets are regular. Moreover, Woodin showed\nthat the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, plus a\nmeasurable cardinal above all of them, implies that every set of reals\nin \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) is determined, i.e., the axiom\n\\(AD^{L(\\mathbb{R})}\\) holds, hence all sets of real numbers that\nbelong to \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), and therefore all projective sets, are\nregular. He also showed that Woodin cardinals provide the optimal\nlarge cardinal assumptions by proving that the following two\nstatements:\n\n\n\nThere are infinitely many Woodin cardinals.\n\n\n\\(AD^{L({\\Bbb R})}\\).\n\n\nare equiconsistent, i.e., ZFC plus 1 is consistent if and only if ZFC\nplus 2 is consistent. See the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for more details and related results.\n\nAnother area in which large cardinals play an important role is the\nexponentiation of singular cardinals. The so-called Singular\nCardinal Hypothesis (SCH) completely determines the behavior of\nthe exponentiation for singular cardinals, modulo the exponentiation\nfor regular cardinals. The SCH follows from the GCH, and so it holds\nin \\(L\\). A consequence of the SCH is that if\n\\(2^{\\aleph_n}<\\aleph_\\omega\\), for all finite \\(n\\), then\n\\(2^{\\aleph_{\\omega}}=\\aleph_{\\omega +1}\\). Thus, if the GCH holds for\ncardinals smaller than \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), then it also holds at\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega\\). The SCH holds above the first supercompact cardinal\n(Solovay). But Magidor (1977) showed that, remarkably, assuming the\nexistence of large cardinals it is possible to build a model of ZFC\nwhere the GCH first fails at \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), hence the SCH fails.\nLarge cardinals stronger than measurable are actually needed for this.\nIn contrast, however, ZFC alone suffices to prove that if the SCH\nholds for all cardinals smaller than \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\), then it\nalso holds for \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\). Moreover, if the SCH holds for\nall singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all\nsingular cardinals (Silver).\n11. Forcing axioms\n\nForcing axioms are axioms of set theory that assert that certain\nexistential statements are absolute between the universe \\(V\\) of all\nsets and its (ideal) forcing extensions, i.e., some existential\nstatements that hold in some forcing extensions of \\(V\\) are already\ntrue in \\(V\\). The first forcing axiom was formulated by Donald Martin\nin the wake of the Solovay-Tennenbaum proof of the consistency of\nSuslin\u2019s Hypothesis, and is now known as Martin\u2019s\nAxiom (MA). Before we state it, let us say that a partial\nordering is a non-empty set \\(P\\) together with a binary relation\n\\(\\leq\\) on \\(P\\) that is reflexive and transitive. Two elements,\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\), of \\(P\\) are called compatible if there\nexists \\(r\\in P\\) such that \\(r\\leq p\\) and \\(r\\leq q\\). An\nantichain of \\(P\\) is a subset of \\(P\\) whose elements are\npairwise-incompatible. A partial ordering \\(P\\) is called ccc\nif every antichain of \\(P\\) is countable. A non-empty subset \\(G\\) of\n\\(P\\) is called a filter if (i) every two elements of \\(G\\)\nare compatible, and (ii) if \\(p\\in G\\) and \\(p\\leq q\\), then also\n\\(q\\in G\\). Finally, a subset \\(D\\) of \\(P\\) is called dense\nif for every \\(p\\in P\\) there is \\(q\\in D\\) such that \\(q\\leq p\\).\n\nMA asserts the following:\n\n\nFor every ccc partial ordering \\(P\\) and every set \\(\\{ D_\\alpha\n:\\alpha <\\kappa \\}\\), where \\(\\kappa \\lt 2^{\\aleph_0}\\), of dense\nsubsets of \\(P\\), there exists a filter \\(G\\subseteq P\\) that is\ngeneric for the set, i.e., \\(G\\cap D_\\alpha \\ne\n{\\varnothing}\\), for all \\(\\alpha <\\kappa\\).\n\n\nSince MA follows easily from the CH, MA is only of interest if the CH\nfails. Martin and Solovay (1970) proved that MA plus the negation of\nthe CH is consistent with ZFC, using iterated forcing with the ccc\nproperty. At first sight, MA may not look like an axiom, namely an\nobvious, or at least reasonable, assertion about sets, but rather like\na technical statement about ccc partial orderings. It does look more\nnatural, however, when expressed in topological terms, for it is\nsimply a generalization of the well-known Baire Category Theorem,\nwhich asserts that in every compact Hausdorff topological space the\nintersection of countably-many dense open sets is non-empty. Indeed,\nMA is equivalent to:\n\n\nIn every compact Hausdorff ccc topological space, the intersection of\nless than \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\)-many dense open sets is non-empty.\n\n\nMA has many different equivalent formulations and has been used very\nsuccessfully to settle a large number of open problems in other areas\nof mathematics. For example, MA plus the negation of the CH implies\nSuslin\u2019s Hypothesis and that every \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) set\nof reals is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also\nimplies that \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) is a regular cardinal, but it does not\ndecide what cardinal it is. See Fremlin (1984) for many more\nconsequences of MA and other equivalent formulations. In spite of\nthis, the status of MA as an axiom of set theory is still unclear.\nPerhaps the most natural formulation of MA, from a foundational point\nof view, is in terms of generic absoluteness. Namely, MA is\nequivalent to the following:\n\n\nFor every ccc partial ordering \\(P\\), if an existential statement,\ncontaining subsets of some cardinal less than \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) as\nparameters, holds in an (ideal) generic extension of \\(V\\) obtained by\nforcing with \\(P\\), then the statement is true, i.e., it holds in\n\\(V\\). In other words, if a set having a property that depends only on\nbounded subsets of \\( 2^{\\aleph_0}\\) exists in some (ideal) generic\nextension of \\(V\\) obtained by forcing with a ccc partial ordering,\nthen a set with that property already exists in \\(V\\).\n\n\nThe notion of ideal generic extension of \\(V\\) can be made precise in\nterms of so-called Boolean-valued models, which provide an alternative\nversion of forcing.\n\nMuch stronger forcing axioms than MA (for \\(\\omega_1\\)) were\nintroduced in the 1980s, such as J. Baumgartner\u2019s Proper\nForcing Axiom (PFA), and the stronger Martin\u2019s\nMaximum (MM) of Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah (1988). Both the PFA\nand MM are consistent relative to the existence of a supercompact\ncardinal. The PFA asserts the same as MA, but for partial orderings\nthat have a property weaker than the ccc, called properness,\nintroduced by Shelah. And MM asserts the same for the wider class of\npartial orderings that, when forcing with them, do not destroy\nstationary subsets of \\(\\omega_1\\).\n\nStrong forcing axioms, such as the PFA and MM imply that all\nprojective sets of reals are determined (PD), and have many other\nstrong consequences in infinite combinatorics. Notably, they imply\nthat the cardinality of the continuum is \\(\\aleph_2\\).\n\nA different forcing axiom is Woodin\u2019s Axiom \\((\\ast)\\), which\nresulted from his analysis of \\(\\mathbb{P}_{{\\rm max}}\\) forcing\nextensions over models of AD. Even though a stronger form of MM known\nas \\({\\rm MM}^{++}\\) and Axiom \\((\\ast)\\) have similar and very rich\nconsequences, both their motivation and their formulation are very\ndifferent, to the point that they were seen as competing axioms. Their\nconnection was far from being clear, until Asper\u00f3 and Schindler\n(2021) showed that, in the presence of large cardinals, Axiom\n\\((\\ast)\\) is equivalent to a bounded form of \\({\\rm MM}^{++}\\), and\ntherefore to a natural generic absoluteness principle.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Asper\u00f3, D. and Schindler, R.
