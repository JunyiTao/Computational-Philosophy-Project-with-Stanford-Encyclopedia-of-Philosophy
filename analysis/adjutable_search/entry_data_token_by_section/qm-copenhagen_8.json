    "main_text": "The Measurement Problem and the Classical-Quantum Distinction\n9. The Measurement Problem and the Classical-Quantum Distinction\n\nApparently, we are living in a quantum world since everything is\nconstituted by atomic and subatomic particles. Hence classical physics\nseems merely to be a useful approximation to a world which is quantum\nmechanical on all scales. Such a view, which many modern physicists\nsupport, can be called quantum fundamentalism (Zinkernagel 2015,\n2016). It can be defined as a position containing two components: (1)\neverything in the Universe is fundamentally of quantum nature (the\nontological component); and (2) everything in the Universe is\nultimately describable in quantum mechanical terms (the\nepistemological component). Thus, we may define quantum fundamentalism\nto be the position holding that everything in the world is essentially\nquantized and that the quantum theory gives us a literal description\nof this nature. The basic assumption behind quantum fundamentalism is\nthat the structure of the formalism, in this case the wave function,\ncorresponds to how the world is structured. For instance, according to\nthe wave function description every quantum system may be in a\nsuperposition of different states because a combination of state\nvectors is also a state vector. Now, assuming that both the quantum\nobject and the measuring apparatus are quantum systems that each can\nbe described by a wave function, it follows that their entangled state\nwould likewise be represented by a state vector. Then the challenge\nis, of course, how we can explain why the pointer of a measuring\ninstrument enters a definite (and not a superposition) position, as\nexperience tells us, whenever the apparatus interacts with the object.\nIn a nutshell this is the measurement problem.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is often taken to subscribe to a\nsolution to the measurement problem that has been offered in terms of\nJohn von Neumann\u2019s projection postulate. In 1932 [1996], von\nNeumann suggested that the entangled state of the object and the\ninstrument collapses to a determinate state whenever a measurement\ntakes place.  This measurement process (a type 1-process as he called\nit) could not be described by quantum mechanics; quantum mechanics can\nonly described type-2 processes (i.e., the development of a quantum\nsystem in terms of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation). In his\ndiscussion of the measurement problem, von Neumann then distinguished\nbetween (i) the system actually observed; (ii) the measuring\ninstrument; and (iii) the actual observer. He argues that during a\nmeasurement the actual observer gets a subjective perception of what\nis going on that has a non-physical nature, which distinguishes it\nfrom the observed object and the measuring instrument. However, he\nholds on to psycho-physical parallelism as a scientific principle,\nwhich he interprets such that there exists a physical correlate to any\nextra-physical process of the subjective experience. So in every case\nwhere we have a subjective perception we must divide the world into\nthe observed system and the observer. But where the division takes\nplace is partly arbitrary.  According von Neumann, it is contextual\nwhether the dividing line is drawn between the description of the\nobserved object (i) and the measuring instrument together with the\nobserver (ii) + (iii), or it is drawn between the description of the\nobserved object together with the measuring instrument, i.e., (i) +\n(ii), and the observer (iii). In other words, von Neumann argues that\nthe observer can never be included in a type 2-process description,\nbut the measuring instrument may sometime be part of a type 2-process,\nalthough it gives the same result with respect to the observed object\n(i). An important consequence of von Neumann\u2019s solution to the\nmeasurement problem is that a type 1-process takes place only in the\npresence of the observer\u2019s consciousness. Furthermore, even when\nvon Neumann considers the situation in which the descriptions of (i)\nand (ii) are combined, he talks about the interaction between the\nphysical system (i) + (ii) and an abstract ego (iii) (Neumann\n1932 [1996], Ch VI).  Therefore, the mind seems to play an active role\nin forming a type 1-process, which would be incompatible with\npsycho-physical parallelism.\n\nIndeed, within philosophy of mind one cannot consistently maintain\nboth psycho-physical parallelism and the existence of an interaction\nbetween the brain and the mind. So it is no wonder that Eugene Wigner\n(1967) followed up on the suggestion of the mind\u2019s interaction\nby proposing that what causes a collapse of the wave function is the\nmind of the observer. But Wigner never explained how it was possible\nfor something mental to produce a material effect like the collapse of\na quantum system. The measuring problem led to the famous paradox of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat and later to the one of Wigner\u2019s\nfriend. Although von Neumann\u2019s and Wigner\u2019s positions are\nusually associated with the Copenhagen Interpretation, such views were\ndefinitely not Bohr\u2019s as we shall see in a moment.\n\nQuantum fundamentalists must indeed be ready to explain why the\nmacroscopic world appears classical. An alternative to von\nNeumann\u2019s projection postulate is the claim that the formalism\nshould be read literally and that measurements (classical outcomes) do\nnot describe the world as it really is. But there are ontological\ncost, which is significant to some. In one interpretation the world\ndivides into as many worlds as there are possible measurement outcomes\neach time a system is observed or interacts with another system. Other\nfundamentalists had hoped that the decoherence program might come up\nwith an appropriate explanation. The decoherence theory sees\nentanglement to exist not only between object and the measurement but\nalso as something which includes the environment. If Bohr had known\nthe idea of decoherence, he would probably have had no objection to\nit, as several authors have pointed to decoherence as a natural\ndynamical extension of his view that measurements is an irreversible\namplification process (Schlosshauer and Camilleri 2015, 2017;\nB\u00e4chtold 2017, Tanona 2017; and Dieks 2017). However, it is\ngenerally agreed that decoherence does not solve the measurement\nproblem (Bacciagaluppi 2016; Zinkernagel 2011). This might seems as if\nvon Neumann\u2019s projection postulate has to be reintroduced as a\ndynamical factor to explain why one and only one measurement result\nappears. However, as Dieks (2017) argues, Bohr\u2019s interpretation\ncould be understood as a non-collapse interpretation, since \u201cthe\nsuperposition does not have an empirical meaning independently of its\ninterpretation via classically described experiments, so no\nreplacement by another mathematical state is needed. We just have to\ninterpret the formulas correctly.\u201d In spite of that there is no\ngeneral agreement to what extent Bohr opposed quantum\nfundamentalism.\n\nTime and again Bohr emphasized that the epistemological distinction\nbetween the instrument and the object is necessary because this is the\nonly way one can functionally make sense of a measurement. The\nepistemic purpose of a measuring instrument is to yield information\nabout an object separated from the instrument itself. It is also\ngenerally agreed that Bohr didn\u2019t treat the classical world of\nthe measuring instrument as epistemically separated from quantum\nobject along the line of a microscopic and macroscopic division. He\nsometimes included parts of the measuring instrument to which the\nquantum mechanical description should be applied. Don Howard (1994)\ntherefore concludes that Bohr was not only an ontological quantum\nfundamentalist but in fact also a sort of an epistemological one. He\nbelieves that one can make Bohr\u2019s requirement that measuring\napparatus and the experimental results have to be described in\nordinary language supplemented with the terminology of classical\nphysics consistent with ontological quantum fundamentalism. According\nto him, Bohr never considered the measuring instrument as a classical\nobject. Moreover, he thinks that this implies that Bohr had to\nunderstand the use of classical concepts differently from what\nscholars usually think. He reinterprets Bohr in terms of quantum\nstates called \u201cmixtures\u201d. Howard believes that with\nrespect to an experimental context in which an instrument interacts\nwith an object, Bohr didn\u2019t understand them as being in an\nentangled state but being separated in a mixture state. The\nconsequence would be that the instrument and the object exist in a\ndefinite quantum state since such a state could be represented as a\nproduct of the wave function for the instrument and for the\nobject.\n\nBut, as Maximilian Schlosshauer and Kristian Camilleri (2008 (Other\nInternet Resources), 2011) have pointed out, this does not solve the\nmeasurement problem. Howard does not explain under which circumstances\none can move from a quantum system-cum-measuring apparatus being in a\nnon-separable state to a mixture of separated states. Therefore one\ncannot be sure that the measuring apparatus is in a definite state and\nits pointer in a definite place. Some philosophers seem to argue that\nBohr was an ontological but not an epistemological quantum\nfundamentalist. For instance, \u201cBohr believed in the fundamental\nand universal nature of quantum mechanics, and saw the classical\ndescription of the apparatus as a purely epistemological move, which\nexpressed the fact that a given quantum system is being used as a\nmeasuring device\u201d (Landsman 2007); and in a similar vein:\n\u201cOne is left with the impression from Bohr\u2019s writings that\nthe quantum-classical divide is a necessary part of the\nepistemological structure of quantum mechanics\u201d (Schlosshauer\nand Camilleri 2008 (Other Internet Resources), 2015). So Klaas\nLandsman (2006, 2007) accepts Howard\u2019s suggestion that Bohr is\nan ontological quantum fundamentalist but he rejects that Bohr should\nbe considered an epistemological quantum fundamentalist. Landsman\nargues that Bohr held that the measuring instrument should be\ndescribed in classical terms since the results of any measurement like\nin classical physics would always have a definite value. However,\nLandsman agrees that Bohr understood all objects as essentially\nquantum mechanical objects.\n\nHowever, it may seem as if both Howard and Landsman miss the pragmatic\nnature of Bohr\u2019s view on ontological issues. Bohr mentioned more\nthan once that physics was not about finding the essence of nature but\nabout describing the phenomena in an unambiguous way. In the\nforeground of Bohr\u2019s thinking was the (1) the need of classical\nconcepts for the description of measuring results; (2)\nnon-separability due to the entanglement of the system and the\nmeasuring instrument; (3) the contextual nature of the measurements of\ncomplementary properties; and (4) the symbolic character of the\nquantum formalism. One has to take all four components into\nconsideration if one wants to understand Bohr\u2019s solution to the\nclassical-quantum problem. According to Bohr, we are in quantum\nmechanics confronted with the \u201cimpossibility of any sharp\nseparation between the behavior of atomic objects and the interaction\nwith the measuring instruments which serve to define the very\nconditions under which the phenomena appear\u201d (APHK, p.\n210). This is definitely a non-classical feature which is described by\nquantum mechanics alone. In his response to the EPR-paper, Bohr\nstrongly rejected that this form of interaction could be regarded as a\nmechanical influence. The influence was on the conditions of\ndescription, i.e. the experimental conditions under which it makes\nsense to apply classical concepts. But during a measurement we need to\nseparate the system from the measuring instrument and the environment\nfor pragmatic reasons. The pragmatic reasons seem to be reasonably\nclear. The outcomes of whatever experiment always yield a definite\nvalue, so the entanglement of object and the measurement instrument\ndescribed by the quantum formalism only lasts until the interaction\nbetween object and instrument stops. The quantum formalism can predict\nthe statistical outcome of these interactions but it cannot say\nanything about the trajectory of objects.\n\nBohr\u2019s firmness about the use of classical concepts for the\ndescriptions of measurement can be seen as his response to the\nmeasurement problem. This problem arises from the fact that quantum\nmechanics itself cannot account for why experiments on objects in a\nstate of superposition always produce a definite outcome. Hence if one\ndoes not argue for spontaneous collapse of the wave function, hidden\nvariables, or many worlds, one needs to supplement quantum mechanics\nwith a classical description of measuring instruments in terms of\nclocks and rods. Henrik Zinkernagel (2015, 2016) may seem to get close\nto Bohr\u2019s view when he argues that Bohr not so much solved the\nmeasuring problem as he dissolved it. According to his interpretation,\nBohr believed in a quantum world, but only relative to a particular\nclassical description and a certain classical world. The distinction\nbetween classical and quantum (both ontic and epistemic) is\ncontextual. He thinks that the measurement problem is ultimately a\nconsequence of ontological quantum fundamentalism (that everything is\nquantum). Because if everything is quantum \u2013 and correctly\ndescribed by quantum formalism (what else would it mean to call\neverything quantum?) \u2013 then a measurement ends up in a\nsuperposition whether we describe the apparatus classical or not. One\ncould say with Zinkernagel that Bohr believed all objects can be\ntreated as quantum objects, but they cannot all be treated as quantum\nobjects at the same time. Borrowing a conception from the two Russian\nphysicists, Landau and Lifshitz, Zinkernagel claims that only some\nparts of the measuring device are entangled with the object in\nquestion, but those parts which are not entangled exists as a\nclassical object. Depending on the context, objects cannot be treated\nas quantum objects in those situations in which they acts as measuring\napparatuses. In these situations the classical treatment of the\nmeasuring device provides us with a frame of reference of space and\ntime with respect to which an atomic object has a position, and,\nmutatis mutandis, with respect to which it has energy and momentum.\nSuch a frame of reference is necessary for our ability to define and\nmeasure a particular property. In Bohr\u2019s own words: \u201cin\neach case [of measurement] some ultimate measuring instruments, like\nthe scales and clocks which determine the frame of space-time\ncoordination on which, in the last resort, even the definitions of\nmomentum and energy quantities rest, must always be described entirely\non classical lines, and consequently kept outside the system subject\nto quantum mechanical treatment\u201d (CC, p. 104). What\ncharacterizes a frame of reference is that it establishes the\nconditions for the ascription of a well-defined position or a\nwell-defined momentum, and treated classically measuring instruments\nact exactly as frames of reference. The implication is that Bohr did\nnot exclude the application of quantum theory to any system. Every\nsystem can in principle be treated quantum mechanically, but since we\nalways need a frame of reference to describe experimental outcomes,\nnot all systems can be treated quantum mechanically at once.\n\nIn this debate Dorato (2017) stresses the fact that by making explicit\nreference to Einstein\u2019s presentation of his special theory of\nrelativity, Bohr regarded quantum mechanics as a theory of principle.\nThis explains both Bohr\u2019s epistemic reliance on the domain of\nclassical physics and his ban of any attempt to construct classical\nobjects from quantum objects. Despite this position Dorato argues that\nin order to justify his entity realism and anti-instrumentalist\ninterpretations, Bohr also needed to postulate something ontologically\ndistinct from the realm of quantum mechanics, a claim that creates the\nwell-known problem of defining in a non-ambiguous and exact way the\ncut between the classical and the quantum realm. By following\nZinkernagel, he claims that this problem is somewhat softened by\nBohr\u2019s contextualist theory of measurement. However,\nBohr\u2019s holism, according to which the measuring device and\nquantum object are in state of entanglement, is in objective tension\nwith Bohr\u2019s thesis of an ontological distinction, especially in\nvirtue of the fact that by referring to the interaction between the\nquantum and the classical system as an irreversible physical process,\nBohr seems to need a constructive approach to quantum mechanics that\nhe wants to avoid.\n\nNonetheless, the question is to what extent Bohr really believed that\nthe classical world is not only epistemically but also ontologically\ndifferent from the quantum world? If he did not make an ontological\ndistinction, there would be no contradiction between his epistemic\nview that the outcome of measurement needs to be described classically\nbut that the apparatus ontologically is just as much a quantum object\nas the object under investigation. So when Bohr regarded quantum\nmechanics as a rational generalization of classical physics, he always\nthought of it as a way to secure the epistemic validity of quantum\nmechanics and not a way to save a classical ontology. Directly\naddressing Zinkernagel\u2019s analysis, Dieks (2017) strongly argues\nthat there can be little doubt that Bohr believed that quantum\nmechanics is universal in the sense that Heisenberg\u2019s\nindeterminacy relation applies to both micro- and macroscopic systems\ndue to the quantum of action. Classical mechanics is a mathematical\napproximation. Moreover, Bohr believed for epistemic reasons that we\nhad to use classical language because this language is a refinement of\nour everyday language, which is adapted to describe our sensory\nexperience and therefore the only language that can endow the quantum\nformalism with an empirical content. Hence, according to Dieks, Bohr\nassumed that it is only an epistemic necessity to describe\n\u201csome systems classically in order to have a pragmatic\nstarting point for the treatment of other systems.\u201d Bohr\u2019s\ndemand of using classical concepts for epistemic reasons has no\nimplications for his view that macroscopic objects are quantum\nobjects. Measuring devices are not classical objects even though we\nneed classical concepts to describe our general physical experiences\nand the outcome of quantum experiments. So Dieks concludes that the\ninteraction between the measuring device and the quantum object\ndetermines, in the classical textbook examples, whether position or\nmomentum talk can be carried over to the quantum object that is\nmeasured. The measuring device itself, if macroscopic and under\nordinary circumstances (so that it really is a measuring device that\ncan be used by us) allows both position and momentum talk in its own\ndescription. The measurement interaction determines which correlations\nare forged with the micro-world.\n",
