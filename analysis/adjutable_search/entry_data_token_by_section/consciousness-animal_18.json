    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness || Vertebrates\n6.5 Vertebrates\n\u2018Fish\u2019 is a folk-biological term that does not correspond precisely\nto any monophyletic taxonomic group. This can be appreciated by noted\nthat a coelacanth is more closely related to a human than to a tuna,\nor that a tuna is more closely related to a human than it is to a\nshark. I.e., some things that are intuitively fish are more closely\nrelated to non-fish than to other fish. Basically, the folk term \u2018fish\u2019\nrefers to all vertebrates other than tetrapods, although it is\nsomewhat ambiguous in regards to animals such as sea-horses, eels,\nhagfish and sting-rays.\nIn any case, there has a lively debate over fish consciousness,\nmostly focusing on the issue of whether fish can experience pain,\nstress and suffering (see below, section 7.1; see also Rose (2002) and\nSneddon et al. (2003) for contrasting views of conscious pain in fish;\nAllen 2013 and Brown 2015 for reviews of fish cognition and\nconsciousness as it may relate to pain; and Braithwaite 2010 for a\nbook-length treatment). This is of special relevance in the context of\nwelfare regulation in commercial aquaculture and recreational angling;\naccordingly, the fish consciousness literature has focused\nexperimentally on salmonids (especially salmon and trout), a group of\nhigh commercial and sport-fishing importance, but only a tiny\nphylogenetic corner of the animals that colloquially count as\nfish. \n Merker (2005) has proposed that consciousness originated early in\nvertebrate evolution, and is therefore both ancient and widespread. On\nthis proposal, not only mammals and birds, but amphibians and all\nmarine vertebrates are conscious. Merker begins his argument with the\nphenomenological observation that the contents of conscious experience\nare object- and goal-oriented, but exclude the fine-grained sensory\nand motor details represented in peripheral and low-level neural\nprocessing. Merker argues that consciousness is an integrated\nrepresentational platform \u2014 what he refers to a\n\u2018synthesized reality space\u2019 \u2014 that, for animals with\ncomplex bodies with many degrees of freedom of movement and multiple\nsensory modalities, solves a cluster of critical neural logistics\nproblems. This includes:\n\nmaintaining the stability of perceptual contents against\ninterference from self-generated motion; \nintegrating interoceptive information about the body\u2019s movements\nand the body\u2019s self-regulative needs (e.g. temperature, thirst,\nhunger); \naffording high-level decision making that abstracts away from the\nirrelevant sensorimotor details of implementation. \n\n The neuroanatomical details of Merker\u2019s argument (2005) are beyond\nthe scope of this article to review, but his conclusion is that the\nsystems that solve the above problems \u2014 giving rise to\nconsciousness \u2014 arose in an early vertebrate ancestor. Hence,\nconsciousness is both ancient and widespread among living\nvertebrates.\n",
