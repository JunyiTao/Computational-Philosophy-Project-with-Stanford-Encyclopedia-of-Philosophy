    "main_text": "Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science || Extrapolation\n3.3 Extrapolation\n\nAs discussed earlier in the historical sections, molecular biologists\nhave relied heavily on model organisms (see the entry on\n models in science).\n The model organisms that were used to lay down the foundation of\nmolecular biology served as \u201cexemplary models\u201d in contrast\nto what today are called \u201csurrogate models\u201d\u2014the\ndistinction comes from Jessica Bolker (2009). According to Bolker,\nexemplary models are \u201crepresentatives of a broader group\u201d\nand the goal of using them is \u201cto elucidate fundamental or\ngeneral biological patterns and mechanisms\u201d (487). But making\ninferences from a single exemplary model to general biological\npatterns has been cause for worry. What grounds do biologists have for\nbelieving that what is true of a mere model is true of many different\norganisms? One answer, provided by Marcel Weber (2005), is that the\ngenerality of biological knowledge obtained from studying exemplary\nmodels can be established on evolutionary grounds. According to Weber,\nif a mechanism is found in a set of phylogenetically distant\norganisms, this provides evidence that it is also likely to be found\nin all organisms that share a common ancestor with the organisms being\ncompared.\n\nExemplary models still play an important role in molecular biology,\nbut a new type of model organism, the \u201csurrogate model\u201d,\nhas become increasingly popular. According to Bolker, surrogate models\n\u201cact as proxies for specific targets\u201d and are often used\nin biomedical research \u201cwhere the objective is to understand the\nmechanisms and etiology of human disease, and ultimately to develop\ntreatments\u201d (Bolker 2009: 489). Unlike the aim of exemplary\nmodels, the representative aim of a surrogate model is not necessarily\nto be broad. Instead, it\u2019s to faithfully replicate a specific\ntarget. For example, biomedical researchers frequently expose\nsurrogate models to harmful chemicals with the aim of modeling human\ndisease. However, if a chemical proves to be carcinogenic in rats, for\nexample, there is no guarantee that it will also cause cancer in\nhumans.\n\nThis difficulty of justifying the inference from rats to humans or,\nmore broadly, of \u201ctransferring causal generalizations from one\ncontext to another when homogeneity cannot be presumed\u201d (Steel\n2008: 3) is known as the problem of extrapolation. Although\nthis problem is not unique to surrogate models, it often arises when\nbiomedical researchers use them to replicate human disease at the\nmolecular level. Consequently, philosophers who write about the\nproblem of extrapolation in the context of molecular biology often\nfocus on such models (see, for example, Ankeny 2001; Baetu 2016;\nBechtel and Abrahamsen 2005; Bolker 1995; Burian 1993b; Darden 2007;\nLaFollette and Shanks 1996; Love 2009; Piotrowska 2013; Schaffner\n1986; Steel 2008; Weber 2005; Wimsatt 1998).\n\nWithin the context of surrogate models, any successful solution to the\nproblem of extrapolation must explain how inferences can be justified\ngiven causally relevant differences between models and their targets\n(Lafollette and Shanks 1996). It must also avoid what Daniel Steel\n(2008) calls the \u201cextrapolator\u2019s circle\u201d, which\narises when attempting to determine whether the model and its target\nare similar enough in casually relevant respects.\n\nOne way to escape the extrapolator\u2019s circle is to black box the\nmechanisms being compared and instead treat the problem of\nextrapolation as a statistical problem (cf. Cook and Campbell 1979).\nThis method avoids the circle because it eliminates the need to know\nif two mechanisms are similar. All that matters is that two outcomes\nare produced to a statistically significant degree, given the same\nintervention. For this reason, statistically significant outcomes in\nclinical trials are at the top of the evidence hierarchy in biomedical\nresearch (Sackett et al. 1996). One problem with relying merely on\nstatistics to solve the problem of extrapolation, however, is that it\ncannot show that an observed correlation between model and target is\nthe result of intervention and not a confounder.\n\n\nA different strategy for avoiding the extrapolator\u2019s circle is\nto remove the black box and compare the two mechanisms but argue that\nthey do not have to be causally similar at every stage for\nextrapolation to be justified. This approach avoids the circle because\nthe suitability of a model can be established given only partial\ninformation about the target. For example, Steel argues that only the\nstages downstream from the point where the mechanisms in the model and\ntarget are likely to differ need to be compared, since the point where\ndifferences are likely will serve as a bottleneck through which the\neventual outcome must be produced.\n\nThough promising, criticisms have been raised against Steel\u2019s\nmechanistic approach to extrapolation. One worry, raised by Jeremy\nHowick et al. (2013), is that in order to identify the bottlenecks and\ndownstream differences, we must know more about the target than Steel\nadmits. If what we know about the mechanism in the target exceeds what\nwe know about the mechanism in the model, the extrapolator\u2019s\ncircle will not have been avoided. Another worry with Steel\u2019s\napproach to extrapolation is that it doesn\u2019t avoid the masking\nproblem. According to Julian Reiss (2010), Federica Russo (2010), and\nBrendan Clarke et al. (2014), even if we establish that X\ncauses Y through some mechanism, this doesn\u2019t seem to\neliminate the possibility of there being several paths that link\nX to Y. For example, there may be an upstream difference\nthat affects the outcome but does not pass through the downstream\nstages of the mechanism. (This problem is taken up again below in\n Section 3.4.)\n A third worry with Steel\u2019s approach, which comes from Tudor\nBaetu (2016), is that mechanistic accounts of the experimental model\nof interest \u201ccombine data from tens or even hundreds of distinct\nexperimental setups\u201d (956). The resulting big picture account of\nthe experimental model is an aggregate of findings that do not\ndescribe a mechanism that actually exists in any cell or organism.\nInstead, as a number of authors have also pointed out (Huber and Keuck\n2013; Lemoine 2017; Nelson 2013), the mechanism of interest is often\nstipulated first and then verified piecemeal in many different\nexperimental organisms. The result is what Mael Lemoine (2017) has\ncalled a \u201ctheoretical chimera\u201d, a hypothesis supported by\nheterogeneous partial models. On the chimera view of extrapolation,\nit\u2019s possible that all one-to-one analogies work, and yet the\naggregate theoretical chimera model fails. \n\nWhile theoretical chimeras seem to further complicate Steel\u2019s\nmechanistic account of extrapolation, actual chimeras also raise\nquestions that Steel does not address. Consider, for example,\nhumanized mice that have been engineered to carry a \u201cpartial or\ncomplete human physiological system\u201d (Macchiarini et al. 2005:\n1307). These genetically engineered rodents are supposed to make\nextrapolation more reliable by simulating a variety of human diseases,\ne.g., asthma, diabetes, cancer, etc. As Monika Piotrowska (2013)\npoints out, however, this raises a new problem. The question is no\nlonger how an inference from model to target can be justified given\nexisting differences between the two, but rather, in what way should\nthese mice be modified in order to justify extrapolation to\nhumans? Piotrowska has proposed three conditions that should be met in\nthe process of modification to ensure that extrapolation is justified.\nThe first two requirements demand that we keep track of parts and\ntheir boundaries during transfer, which presupposes a mechanistic view\nof human disease, but the third requirement\u2014that the constraints\nthat might prevent the trait from being expressed be\neliminated\u2014highlights the limits of using a mechanistic approach\nwhen making inferences from humanized mice to humans. As Piotrowska\nexplains,\n\n\nwithout the right context, even the complete lack of differences\nbetween two mechanisms cannot justify the inference that what is true\nof one mechanism will be true of another (Piotrowska 2013: 453).\n\n\nIf Piotrowska is right, Steel\u2019s mechanistic solution to the\nproblem of extrapolation seems to have reached its limit. As our\nability to manipulate biological models advances, philosophers will\nneed to revisit the problem of extrapolation and seek out new\nsolutions.\n",
