    "main_text": "Relative Identity\n3. Relative Identity\n\nThe fundamental claim of relative identity\u2014the claim the various\nversions of the idea have in common\u2014is that, as it seems in the\npassenger/person case, it can and does happen that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nthe same \\(F\\) and (yet) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not the same \\(G\\). Now\nit is usually supposed that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\n(\\(G\\) etc.), then that implies that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(F\\)s\n\\((G\\)s, etc.) If so, then the above schema is trivially satisfied by\nthe case in which \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same person but \\(x\\)\n(\\(y\\)) is not a passenger at all. But let us resolve to use the\nphrase \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different \\(G\\)s\u201d to mean\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(G\\)s and \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not the same\n\\(G\\)\u201d. Then the nontrivial core claim about relative identity\nis that the following may well be true:\n\n(RI)\n \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\) but \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\ndifferent \\(G\\)s. \n\n\nRI is a very interesting thesis. It seems to yield dramatically simple\nsolutions to (at least some of) the puzzles about identity. We appear\nto be in a position to assert that young Oscar and old Oscar are the\nsame dog but nonetheless distinct \u201ctemporary\u201d objects;\nthat Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are the same dog but different\ndog parts; that the same piece of clay can be now (identical to) one\nstatue and now another; that London and Londres are the same city but\ndifferent \u201cobjects of thought\u201d, and so forth. Doubts\ndevelop quickly, however. Either the same dog relation\nsatisfies LL or it does not. If it does not, it is unclear why it\nshould be taken to be a relation of identity. But if it\nsatisfies LL, then it follows, given that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are different dog parts, that\nOscar\u2212 is not the same dog part as\nOscar\u2212. Furthermore, assuming that the same dog\npart relation is reflexive, it follows from the\nassumption that Oscar\u2212 and Oscar\u2212\nare the same dog (and that LL is in force), that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are indeed the same dog part, which in fact\nthey are not.\n\nIt may seem, then, that RI is simply incoherent. These arguments,\nhowever, are a bit too quick. On analysis, they show only that the\nfollowing three conditions form an inconsistent triad: \n\n RI is true (for some fixed predicates \\(F\\) and \\(G)\\). \n Identity relations are equivalence relations. \n The relation x and y are the same F figuring in (1)\nsatisfies LL.\n\n\nFor suppose that the relation x and y are the same G,\nfiguring in (1), is reflexive and that \\(x\\) is a \\(G\\). Then \\(x\\) is\nthe same \\(G\\) as \\(x\\). But according to (1), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not\nthe same \\(G\\)s; hence, according to (3), it is not the case that\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\); yet (1) asserts otherwise. Now,\nmost relative identity theorists maintain that while identity\nrelations are equivalence relations, they do not in general satisfy\nLL. However, according to at least one analysis of the\npassenger/person case (and others), the same person relation\nsatisfies LL but the same passenger relation is not\nstraightforwardly an equivalence relation (Gupta 1980). It should be\nclear though that this view is incompatible with the principle of the\nidentity of indiscernibles: If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different\npassengers, there must be, by the latter principle, some property\n\\(x\\) possesses that \\(y\\) does not. Hence if the same person\nrelation satisfies LL, it follows that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nnot the same person. For the remainder we will assume that\nidentity relations are equivalence relations. Given this assumption\n(and assuming that the underlying propositional logic is\nclassical\u2014cf. Parsons 2000), RI and LL are incompatible in the\nsense that within the framework of a single fixed language for which\nLL is defined, RI and LL are incompatible.\n\nYet the advocate of relative identity cannot simply reject any form of\nLL. There are true and indispensable instances of LL: If \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same dog, then, surely, if \\(x\\) is a Dalmatian, so is\n\\(y\\). The problem is that of formulating and motivating\nrestricted forms of LL that are nonetheless strong enough to\nbear the burden of identity claims. There has been little systematic\nwork done in this direction, crucial though it is to the relative\nidentity project. (See Deutsch 1997 for discussion of this issue.)\nThere are, however, equivalence relations that do satisfy restricted\nforms of LL. These are sometimes called \u201ccongruence\nrelations\u201d and they turn up frequently in mathematics. For\nexample, say that integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are congruent if their\ndifference \\(n - m\\) is a multiple of 3. This relation preserves\nmultiplication and addition, but not every property. The numbers 2 and\n11 are thus congruent but 2 is even and 11 is not. There are also\nnon-mathematical congruencies. For example, the relation x and y\nare traveling at the same speed preserves certain properties and\nnot others. If objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are traveling at the same speed\nand \\(x\\) is traveling faster than \\(z\\), the same is true of \\(y\\).\nSuch similarity relations satisfy restricted forms of LL. In fact, any\nequivalence relation satisfies a certain minimal form of LL (see\nbelow).\n\nThere are strong and weak versions of RI. The weak version says that\nRI has some (in fact, many) true instances but also that there are\npredicates \\(F\\) such that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\),\nthen, for any equivalence relation, \\(E\\), whatsoever (whether or not\nan identity relation), \\(E(x,y)\\). This last condition implies that\nthe relation x and y are the same F satisfies LL. The\nrelation \\(P\\) defined so that \\(P(x,y)\\) if and only if \\(H(x)\\) and\n\\(H(y)\\), where \\(H\\) is some predicate, is an equivalence relation.\nHence, if \\(H\\) holds of \\(x\\) but not of \\(y\\), there is an\nequivalence relation (namely, \\(P(x,y))\\) that fails to hold of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\). If we add that in this instance \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nthe same \\(F\\)\u201d is to be interpreted in terms of the relation\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\), then the weak version of RI says that there is such a\nthing as relative identity and such a thing as absolute identity as\nwell. The strong version, by contrast, says that there are (many) true\ninstances of RI but there is no such thing as absolute identity. It is\ndifficult to know what to make of the latter claim. Taken literally,\nit is false. The notion of unrestricted identity (in the sense of\n\u201cunrestricted\u201d explained in \u00a71) is demonstrably\ncoherent. We return to this matter in \u00a75.\n\nThe puzzles about identity outlined in \u00a72 (and there are many\nothers, as well as many variants of these) put considerable pressure\non the standard account. A theory of identity that allows for\ninstances of RI is an attractive alternative (see below \u00a74). But\nthere is a certain kind of example of RI, frequently discussed in the\nliterature, that has given relative identity something of a bad name.\nThe passenger/person example is a case in point. The noun\n\u201cpassenger\u201d is derived from the corresponding relational\nexpression \u201cpassenger in (on) \u2026\u201d. A passenger is\nsomeone who is a passenger in some vehicle (on some flight, etc.).\nSimilarly, a father is a man who fathers someone or who is the father\nof someone. This way of defining a kind of things from a relation\nbetween things is perfectly legitimate and altogether open-ended.\nGiven any relation \\(R\\), we can define \u201can \\(R\\)\u201d to\napply to anything \\(x\\) that stands in \\(R\\) to something \\(y\\). For\nexample, we can define a \u201cschmapple\u201d to be an apple in a\nbarrel. All this is fine. But we can\u2019t infer from such\na definition that the same apple might be two different schmapples.\nFrom the fact that someone is the father of two different children, we\ndon\u2019t judge that he is two different fathers. The fact that\nairlines choose to count passengers as they do, rather than track\npersons, is their business, not logic\u2019s.\n\nHowever, when \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation, we are entitled to\nsuch an inference. Consider the notorious case of \u201csurmen\u201d\n(Geach 1967). A pair of men are the \u201csame surman\u201d if they\nhave the same surname; and a surman is a man who bears this relation\nto someone. So now it appears that two different men can be the same\nsurman, since two different men can have the same surname. As Geach\n(1967) insists (also Geach 1973), surmen are defined to be\nmen, so they are not merely classes of men. Hence we seem to have an\ninstance of RI, and obviously any similarity relation (e.g., \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) have the same shape) will give rise to a similar case. Yet such\ninstances of RI are not very interesting. It is granted all around\nthat when \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d is adjectival,\ndifferent \\(G\\)s may be the same \\(F\\). Different men may have the\nsame surname, different objects the same color, etc. Turning an\nadjectival similarity relation into a substantival one having the form\nof an identity statement yields an identity statement in name\nonly.\n\nA word about the point of view of those who subscribe to the weak\nversion of RI. The view (call it the \u201cweak view\u201d) is that\nordinary identity relations concerning (largely) the world of\ncontingency and change are equivalence relations answering to\nrestricted forms of LL. The exact nature of the restriction depends on\nthe equivalence relation itself, though there is an element of\ngenerality. The kinds of properties preserved by the same dog\nrelation are intuitively the same kinds of properties as are\npreserved by the same cat relation. From a logical point of\nview the best that can be said is that any identity relation, like any\nequivalence relation, preserves a certain minimal set of properties.\nFor suppose \\(E\\) is some equivalence relation. Let \\(S\\) be the set\ncontaining all formulas of the form \\(E(x,y)\\), and closed under the\nformation of negations, conjunctions, and quantification. Then \\(E\\)\npreserves any property expressed by a formula in \\(S\\). Furthermore,\non this view, although absolutely distinct objects may be the same\n\\(F\\), absolutely identical objects cannot differ at all. Any instance\nof RI implies that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct.\n",
