    "main_text": "The Festival\n5. The Festival\n\nConventional accounts of aesthetic experience stress its intense and\nindividuating nature (Erlebnis). Yet despite its intimacy,\nGadamer emphasizes that within experience (Erfahrung) one is\nalways participating, perhaps unwittingly, in something beyond\noneself. Aesthetic involvement is in some respects, therefore, a\ncommunal activity. The analogy between aesthetic experience and the\nfestival or festive celebration is telling.\n\nWork is something that separates and divides us. For all the\ncooperation necessitated by joint enterprise and the division of labor\nin our productive activity, we are still divided as individuals as far\nas our day to day purposes are concerned. Festive celebration, on the\nother hand, is clearly distinguished by the fact that here we are not\nprimarily separated but rather gathered together. (RB 40)\n\n\nGadamer\u2019s thinking here betrays a further Kantian inflection.\nThe Kantian conception of aesthetic pleasure, as a variety of\nexperience which arises only where the egotistical interests that\nconstitute the commerce of everyday life are not in play, suggests the\npossibility of a community forming around shared non-hostile\npleasures. Gadamer\u2019s account of aesthetic experience is not\nconcerned with a putative kingdom-to-come but with rediscovering and\nforging the communality that we are. Despite this difference,\naesthetic experience establishes for both thinkers a meditative space\nin and through which something can be occasioned. The underlying point\nremains. Whereas for Kant\u00a0it is a change in the disposition of\nsubjective consciousness (i.e., its adoption of an aesthetic\nattitude) that initiates a better disposition towards the community,\nfor Gadamer it is the participation in a trans-subjective\nevent that effects a change in subjective dispositions towards\nthe community.\n\nWhen Gadamer argues that \u201cthe mystery of festive celebration\nlies in this suspension of time,\u201d he refers to how festivity\nsuspends work-time (RB 59). This initiates that festival\u00a0or\n\u201cfullfilled\u201d time in which another order of events emerges (RB 42). It\nis in such time that an artwork \u201ccomes to stand\u201d\nirrespective of whether it is a painting, drama, or symphony. The\nfestive \u201crepresents a genuine creation: something drawn from\nwithin ourselves takes shape before our eyes in a form that we\nrecognise and experience as a more profound presentation of our own\nreality\u201d (RB 60). This distances Gadamer from the view that\naesthetic experience is a solitary subject\u2019s personal response\nto an artwork. In the festive\u2014an analogy for the communal\ndimensions of aesthetic experience\u2014the individual subject comes\nto stand differently in its relationship to others. Just as the\nartwork comes to stand in the festival, so too does the artwork bring\nits spectators to stand as a community: \u201cin the festive the\ncommunal spirit that supports us all and transcends each of us\nindividually\u201d\u00a0discloses the real power of both the festive\nand the work of art (RB 63).\u00a0The festival occasions individuals\nsurpassing their everyday view of themselves as potentially hostile\ncompetitors and coming to see themselves as a community formed around\na shared interest in what the artwork brings forth. This is an analogy\nfor something more fundamental.\n\nInstrumentalist conceptions of language persuade us that the spoken\nand written word are but communicative tools, but for Gadamer\nparticipation in language acknowledges that an individual is located\nwithin a substantive horizon of meanings which transcends subjective\nconsciousness. Pragmatic concerns encourage the forgetting of such\ninterconnectedness but when such individualism is suspended by the\nfestival or, indeed, by the adoption of a hermeneutically-attuned\naesthetic attitude, the re-discovery of oneself as belonging to an\nextensive community of shared meanings and involvements becomes\npossible. The artwork\u2019s communicative capacity awakens the\nrealization that in as much as I understand myself as being addressed,\nI must acknowledge that I already belong to something larger than\nmyself. The artwork festivises: it reveals our personal\nindebtedness to past and future communities of meaning. The thesis\nthat we belong to a hermeneutic collective which is the effective\nunderpinning of art\u2019s ability to communicate is further\nelaborated in Gadamer\u2019s discussion of the symbol.\n",
