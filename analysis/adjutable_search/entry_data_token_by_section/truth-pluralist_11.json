    "main_text": "Objections to pluralism and responses || The problem of generalization\n4.5 The problem of generalization\n\n\nAlethic terms are useful devices for generalizing. For instance,\nsuppose we wish to state the law of excluded middle. A tedious way\nwould be to produce a long\u2014indeed,\ninfinite\u2014conjunction:\n\n(53) Everything is either actual or non-actual, and thick or not\nthick, and red or not red, and \u2026\n\n\n\nHowever, given the equivalence schema for propositions,\n\n(54) The proposition that \\(p\\) is true iff \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nthere is a much shorter formula, which captures what (54) is meant\nto express by using \u2018true\u2019, but without loss of explanatory\npower (Horwich 1990: 4):\n\n(55) Every proposition of the form \\(\\langle\\)everything is \\(G\\) or\nnot\\(-G\\rangle\\) is true.\n\n\n\nAlethic terms are also useful devices for generalizing over what\nspeakers say, as in\n\n(56) What Chen said is true.\n\n\n\nThe utility of a generalization like (56) is not so much that it\neliminates the need to rely on an infinite conjunction, but that it is\n\u2018blind\u2019 (i.e., made under partial ignorance of what was\nsaid).\n\n\nPluralists seem to have difficulty accounting for truth\u2019s use\nas a device for generalization. One response is to simply treat uses of\n\u2018is true\u2019 as elliptical for \u2018is true in one way or\nanother\u2019. In doing so, pluralists account for generalization\nwithout sacrificing their pluralism. A possible drawback, however, is\nthat it may commit pluralists to the claim that \u2018true\u2019\ndesignates the disjunctive property of being \\(F_1\n\\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\). Granting the existence of\nsuch a property gives pluralists a story to tell about generalizations\nlike (55) and (56), but the response is a concessive one available only\nto moderate pluralists. However, as noted in \u00a74.2.3, the existence\nof such a property is not a devastating blow to all pluralists, since\nthe domain-specific truth properties \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) remain explanatorily basic in relation to the\nproperty of being \\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\).\n",
