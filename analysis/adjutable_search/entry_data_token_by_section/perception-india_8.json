    "main_text": "Nirvikalpaka and Savikalpaka Pratyak\u1e63a || The basis of Buddhist nominalism\n3.1 The basis of Buddhist nominalism\n\nThe distinction between non-conceptual and conceptual was first drawn\nby Di\u1e45n\u0101ga who contended that all perception is\nnon-conceptual because what constitutes seeing things as they really\nare must be free from any conceptual construction. The claim\nis that a verbal report of proper perception is strictly impossible,\nfor such a report requires conceptualization, which is not perceptual\nin character; the objects of conceptual awareness are spontaneous\nconstructions of our mind and are essentially linguistic in character.\nOn the other hand, what is seen, \u2018the given\u2019, does not\ncarry a word or a name as its label and neither is such a label\ngrasped along with the object, nor inherent in it, nor even produced\nby it; objects-as-such, the real particulars\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47as), do not, as Quine would say, wear\ntheir names on their sleeves. Furthermore, the sense faculty cannot\ngrasp a concept or a name; if I have never smelt garlic before I first\nencounter it, I cannot smell it as garlic, though I can smell\nIT; an olfactory awareness can only grasp a smell present in\nthe olfactory field. The Buddhists argue that a perceiver apprehends\nonly the real particulars, arbitrarily imposes concepts/words\non them and believes, mistakenly, that these are really there\nin the objects and integral to them. The conceptual awareness conceals\nits own imaginative quality and, because it results directly from\nexperience, the perceiver takes it to be a perceptual experience. The\nperceiver fails to notice that imagination is involved and mistakenly\nthinks that he really perceives the constructed world. From the\nBuddhists standpoint, therefore, a perceiver can only perceive real\nparticulars so that any perceptual experience is always and only at\nthe non-conceptual level.\n",
