    "main_text": "Probability in the MWI || Probability Postulate from Symmetry Arguments\n4.3 Probability Postulate from Symmetry Arguments\n\nIn an ambitious work Deutsch 1999 claimed to derive the Probability\nPostulate from the quantum formalism and classical decision theory. In\nDeutsch\u2019s argument the notion of probability is operationalised\nby being reduced to an agent\u2019s betting preferences. So an agent\nwho is indifferent between receiving $20 on those branches where spin\n\u201cup\u201d is observed and receiving $10 on all branches by\ndefinition is deemed to give probability 1/2 to the spin-up\nbranches. Deutsch then attempts, using some symmetry arguments, to\nprove that the only rationally coherent strategy for an agent is to\nassign these operationalised \u201cprobabilities\u201d to equal the\nquantum-mechanical branch weights. Wallace 2003, 2007, 2010b, 2012\ndeveloped this approach by making explicit the tacit assumptions in\nDeutsch\u2019s argument. In the most recent version of these proofs,\nthe central assumptions are (i) the symmetry structure of unitary\nquantum mechanics; (ii) that an agent\u2019s preferences are\nconsistent across time; (iii) that an agent is indifferent to the\nfine-grained branching structure of the world per se. Early criticisms\nof the Deutsch-Wallace approach focussed on circularity concerns\n(Barnum et al. 2000, Baker 2007, Hemmo and Pitowsky 2007). As\nthe program led to more explicit proofs, criticism turned to the\ndecision-theoretic assumptions being made Lewis 2010, Albert 2010,\nKent 2010, Price 2010). The analysis of the Deutsch-Wallace program\ncontinues in a flurry of (mostly critical) papers Adlam 2014, Dawid\nand Th\u00e9bault 2014, Dawid and Th\u00e9bault 2015,\nDizadji-Bahmani 2015, Jansson 2016, Read 2018, Mandolesi 2018,\nMandolesi 2019, Araujo 2019, Brown and Ben Porath 2020, Saunders\nforthcoming-b.\n\nZurek 2005 offers a new twist to the Born rule derivation based on the\npermutation symmetry of states corresponding to worlds with equal\nmeasures of existence. He considered entangled systems and relies on\n\u201cenvariance\u201d symmetry: a unitary evolution of a system\nwhich can be undone by the unitary evolution of the system it is\nentangled with. Zurek assumes that a manipulation of the second system\ndoes not change the probability of the measurement on the first\nsystem. The swap of the states of the system swaps the probabilities\nof the outcomes, because the outcomes are correlated with the other\nsystems, where nothing has been changed. Since the swaps of the two\nsystems lead to the original state, the probabilities should be\nunchanged, but they have swapped, so they must be equal.\n\nSebens and Carroll 2018 provided a proof of the Probability Postulate\nbased on symmetry considerations in the framework of the self-location\nuncertainty of Vaidman 1998. However Kent 2015 and McQueen and Vaidman\n2019 argued that their proof fails because it starts with a\nmeaningless question. The proof considers a situation as in a sleeping\npill experiment presented above: I was asleep during a quantum\nmeasurement, but unlike the original proposal, there was not any change\nin my state. I was not moved to different rooms according to the\nresults of the experiment. Still, the question is asked: What is the\nprobability for me to be in a world with a particular outcome? Whether\nthat question can be meaningfully asked depends on whether I have\nbranched. The critics argue that, although there are separate worlds,\nI have not yet branched and thus the question is not meaningful (at\nthis stage, I am in both worlds). The Sebens and Carroll proof might\nget off the ground if the program of diverging worlds Saunders 2010,\nforthcoming-b succeeds. Note also that Dawid and Friederich 2020 criticise\nSebens and Carroll 2018 on other grounds.\n\nVaidman 2012 uses symmetry to derive the Probability Postulate in\nanother way. He starts from a situation which is symmetric in all\nrelevant respects, so all outcomes must have equal probability. To\nderive the postulate, he assumes relativistic causality which tells us\nthat the probability of an outcome of a measurement in one location\ncannot be affected by spatially remote manipulations, see McQueen and\nVaidman 2019. Vaidman 2020 stresses, however, that relativistic\ncausality of the evolution of the wave function of the Universe is not\nenough. In addition, we have to postulate the relativistic causality\nof the subjective experience of an observer within his world.\n",
