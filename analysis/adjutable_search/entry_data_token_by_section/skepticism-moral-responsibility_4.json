    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Impossibility of Ultimate Responsibility\n2.3 Impossibility of Ultimate Responsibility\n\nAnother argument for moral responsibility skepticism, one that makes\nno appeal at all to determinism or indeterminism, was first introduced\nby Friedrich Nietzsche (1886 [1992]) and later revived and fleshed out\nby Galen Strawson (1994, 2011). This argument maintains that free will\nand ultimate moral responsibility are incoherent concepts, since to be\nfree in the sense required for ultimate moral responsibility we would\nhave to be causa sui (or \u201ccause of oneself\u201d) and\nthis is impossible. Nietzsche, for example, writes:\n\n\nThe causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has been\nconceived so far; it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic. But\nthe extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly\nand frightfully with just this nonsense. The desire for \u201cfreedom\nof the will\u201d in the superlative metaphysical sense, which still\nholds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated; the\ndesire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one\u2019s\nactions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and\nsociety involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa\nsui and, with more than Baron Munchhausen\u2019s audacity, to\npull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of\nnothingness. (1886 [1992] sec. 21)\n\n\nGalen Strawson makes a similar case for the impossibility of moral\nresponsibility with his so-called Basic Argument (1986, 1994,\n2011). The central argument can be summarized as follows:\n\nNothing can be causa sui\u2014nothing can be the cause\nof itself.\nIn order to be truly or ultimately morally responsible for\none\u2019s actions one would have to be causa sui, at least\nin certain crucial mental respects.\nTherefore, no one can be truly or ultimately morally\nresponsible.\n\n\nThe expanded version of the argument runs as follows (Strawson\n2011):\n\nInterested in free action, we\u2019re particularly interested in\nactions performed for a reason (as opposed to reflex actions or\nmindlessly habitual actions).\nWhen one acts for a reason, what one does is a function of how one\nis, mentally speaking.\nSo if one is to be truly responsible for how one acts, one must be\ntruly responsible for how one is, mentally speaking\u2014at least in\ncertain respects.\nBut to be truly responsible for how one is, in any mental respect,\none must have brought it about that one is the way one is, in that\nrespect. And it\u2019s not merely that one must have caused oneself\nto be the way one is, in that respect. One must also have consciously\nand explicitly chosen to be the way one is, in that respect, and one\nmust have succeeded in bringing it about that one is that way.\nBut one can\u2019t really be said to choose, in a conscious,\nreasoned, fashion, to be the way one is in any respect at all, unless\none already exists, mentally speaking, already equipped with some\nprinciples of choice, \u201cP1\u201d\u2014preferences, values,\nideals\u2014in the light of which one chooses how to be.\nBut then to be truly responsible, on account of having chosen to\nbe the way one is, in certain mental respects, one must be truly\nresponsible for one\u2019s having the principles of choice P1 in the\nlight of which one chose how to be.\nBut for this to be so one must have chosen P1, in a reasoned,\nconscious, intentional fashion.\nBut for this to be so one must already have had some principles of\nchoice P2, in the light of which one chose P1.\nAnd so on. Here we are setting out on a regress that we cannot\nstop. True self-determination is impossible because it requires the\nactual completion of an infinite series of choices of principles of\nchoice.\nSo true moral responsibility is impossible, because it requires\ntrue self-determination, as noted in (3).\n\n\nThis argument trades on some strong and commonsense intuitions.\nIt\u2019s intuitive to think that one is initially the way one is as\na result of heredity and early experience\u2014and it\u2019s\nundeniable that these are factors for which one cannot be held in any\nway responsible (morally or otherwise). Yet, it also makes sense to\nthink that one cannot at any later stage of life hope to accede to\ntrue or ultimate moral responsibility for the way one is by trying to\nchange the way one already is as a result of one\u2019s genetic\ninheritance and previous experience, since both the particular way in\nwhich one is moved to try to change oneself, and the degree of\none\u2019s success in one\u2019s attempt to change, will be\ndetermined by how one already is as a result of one\u2019s genetic\ninheritance and previous experience. And any further changes that one\ncan bring about only after one has brought about certain initial\nchanges will in turn be determined, via the initial changes, by\none\u2019s genetic inheritance and previous experience. Such is\nStrawson\u2019s argument for the impossibility of moral\nresponsibility.\n\nWhile this argument is simple, eloquent, and rather intuitive, it has\nbeen widely criticized by compatibilists and libertarians alike (see,\ne.g., Hurley 2000; Clarke 2005a; Bernstein 2005; Fischer 2006; Kane\n2000; Coates 2017; for replies see Istvan 2011; Parks 2009). Some\ncritics question Strawson\u2019s notion of ultimate\nresponsibility, which he defines as \n\n\nresponsibility of such a kind that, if we have it, then it makes\nsense to suppose that it could be just to punish some of us with\n(eternal) torment in hell and reward others with (eternal) bliss in\nheaven. (2011: 43) \n\n\nOthers critics challenge the claim that in order to be responsible for\none\u2019s actions, one has to be the cause of oneself. In the\nopposite direction, others try to escape from the regress of the\nargument by making sense of the possibility of self-creation\n(Bernstein 2005; see also Kane 1996; Lemos 2015; Roskies 2012). Others\nstill attack the claim that if what one does when one acts for a\nreason is to be up to one, then how one is mentally, in some respect,\nmust be up to one (Clarke 2005a). Finally, some simply suggest that accounts of free action\nare often meant to be accounts of precisely how it can be\nthat, even if it is not up to an agent how she is mentally, her action\ncan still be up to her, she can still have a choice about whether she\nperforms the action, even when she acts for reasons (Mele 1995:\n221\u201327).\n\nDefenders of the Basic Argument have attempted to counter these\nobjections in a number of ways. Some respond by arguing, contra\nFischer (2006), that the Basic Argument does not rely on the premise\nthat an agent can be responsible for an action only if she is\nresponsible for every factor contributing to that action (see\nIstvan 2011). Others argue, in response to Mele (1995) and Clarke\n(2005a), that it is highly counterintuitive to believe that an agent\ncan be morally responsible for an action when no factor contributing\nto that action is up to that agent (Istvan 2011). In response to the\nsuggestion that certain versions of agent-causal libertarianism can\nimmunize the agent to the Basic Argument (see Clarke 2005a), they\nargue that such accounts actually fail to do so (Istvan 2011). Lastly,\nsome defenders of the Basic Argument recast the argument in a form\nthat eliminates certain problems associated with Strawson\u2019s\noriginal version and offer additional thought experiments to bolster\nits underlying assumptions (see Parks 2009).\n",
