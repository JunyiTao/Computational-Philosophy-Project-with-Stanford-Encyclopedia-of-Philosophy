    "main_text": "\n\nLegalism (which henceforth will be called the fa tradition)\nis a popular\u2014albeit quite inaccurate\u2014designation of an\nintellectual current that gained considerable popularity in the latter\nhalf of the Warring States period (Zhanguo, 453\u2013221 BCE).\nFa thinkers were political realists who sought to attain\n\u201ca rich state and a powerful army\u201d and to ensure domestic\nstability in an age marked by intense inter- and intra-state\ncompetition. They believed that human beings\u2014commoners and\nelites alike\u2014will forever remain selfish and covetous of riches\nand fame, and one should not expect them to behave morally. Rather, a\nviable sociopolitical system should allow individuals to pursue their\nselfish interests exclusively in the ways that benefit the state, viz.\nagriculture and warfare. Parallel to this, a proper administrative\nsystem should allow officials to benefit from ranks and emoluments,\nbut also prevent them from subverting the ruler\u2019s power. Both\nsystems are unconcerned with individual morality of the rulers and the\nruled; rather they should be based on impersonal norms and standards:\nlaws, administrative regulations, clearly defined rules of promotion\nand demotion, and the like.\n\nFa thinkers contributed greatly to the formation of\nChina\u2019s empire both on the theoretical level and as political\npractitioners; and many of their ideas continued to be employed\nthroughout China\u2019s history. Yet their derisive views of their\nrivals\u2019 moralizing discourse, haughty stance toward fellow\nintellectuals, and pronouncedly anti-ministerial rhetoric\u2014all\ngained them immense dislike among the imperial literati. From\nChina\u2019s second imperial dynasty, the Han (206/202 BCE\u2013220\nCE) on, the prestige of the fa tradition declined; only a few\ntexts associated with this current survived intact; and even in the\nmodern period, notwithstanding sporadic outbursts of interest in\nfa thought, this current had not received adequate scholarly\nattention. Only in the second decade of the twenty-first century is\nthe trend changing, as past sensitivities are receding and more\nscholars in China and outside it are ready to address the intellectual\nrichness of fa thought.\n",
