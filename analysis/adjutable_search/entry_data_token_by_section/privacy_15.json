    "main_text": "Contemporary Debates || The Democratic Value of Privacy\n4.4 The Democratic Value of Privacy\n\nTheorists have repeatedly pointed to the connection between the\nprotection of privacy, understood as the protection of individual\nautonomy, and the protection of democracy (see Goold 2010:\n38\u201348). Hughes, for example, speaks of privacy as a\n\u201cbulwark against totalitarianism\u201d (2015: 228), while\nSpiros Simitis describes the right to privacy as \u201ca constitutive\nelement of a democratic society\u201d (1987: 732). Probably the\nbest-known advocate of privacy with a view to democracy is Ruth\nGavison. She argues that the protection of privacy both supports and\nencourages the moral autonomy of citizens, which is an essential\nprecondition of democratic societies (Gavison 1980: 455; see also\nHughes 2015: 228; Simitis 1987: 732; Solove 2008: 98\u2013100;\nSchwartz 1999). There can be no democratic self-determination without\nthe protection of privacy. Hence, government intervention for the\nsecurity of citizens becomes an ideology that threatens democracy when\nits goal is no longer the freedom of individuals\u2014that is, when\ncitizens are no longer treated by the state as democratic subjects,\nbut as objects.\n\nMokrosinska emphasizes privacy as a democratic value, thus\nstrengthening that value when it comes into competition with freedom\nof expression and other political interests. Privacy can facilitate\nsetting aside deep disagreements in order for political engagement in\na democracy to proceed. Thus, Mokrosinska proposes a strategy for\nmediating between privacy and free speech when they collide\n(Mokrosinska 2015). Lever, in a monograph on privacy and democracy,\ndevelops a comprehensive theory and argues that privacy is in\ndifferent ways essential for democracies and for the freedom,\nequality, and solidarity of democratic subjects (Lever 2013). From a\ndifferent perspective, Stahl (2020) discusses ways in which\n\u201csurveillance of intentionally public activities\u201d should\nbe criticized. Drawing on the theories of contextual integrity\n(Nissenbaum) and of the public sphere (Habermas), Stahl argues\nthat\n\n\nstrategic surveillance of the public sphere can undermine the capacity\nof citizens to freely deliberate in public and therefore conflicts\nwith democratic self-determination. (2020: 1)\n\n\nThe democratic value of privacy also plays a central role in\nRepublicanism, since threats to privacy are always also\nthreats to democracy. Republicans point out the value of privacy by\ncontrasting it to liberal theories, which cannot explain the\npossible threat to privacy\u2014not just the actual\ninterference\u2014as an encroachment on the freedom of subjects.\nAndrew Roberts (2015: 320) writes that for republicans, because\nprivacy\n\n\nis a pre-requisite for effective participation in political life, and\nrepublicans consider such participation to be the essence of\nself-government and the means through which a polity can secure\nconditions of freedom, in a republican democracy individual privacy\nwill be seen as a collective good.\n\n\n(For a far more elaborate account along similar lines, see A. Roberts\n2022; as well as Schwartz 1999)\n",
