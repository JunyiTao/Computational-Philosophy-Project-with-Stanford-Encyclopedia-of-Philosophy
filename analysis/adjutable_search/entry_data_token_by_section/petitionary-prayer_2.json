    "main_text": "Divine Moral Perfection\n4. Divine Moral Perfection\n\nTheists have traditionally recognized a number of limits on\nGod\u2019s actions. For instance, it is common to insist that\nGod\u2019s omnipotence does not imply that God can do impossible\nthings, such as create stones that are too heavy for God to lift. It\nis also common to insist that God cannot do that which is\nintrinsically evil, because God is morally perfect. (For a discussion\nof petitionary prayers for bad things, see Smilansky 2012.) Since God\nis provident, one might also suspect that God would not answer\npetitionary prayers for things that would interfere with God\u2019s\nprovidential plans for the world. Within these limits, one might\nwonder whether there is enough room among the space of God\u2019s\nreasons for petitionary prayers to make a difference, and what kinds\nof reasons such prayers could provide for God.\n\nSome have argued that God\u2019s moral perfection implies that\npetitionary prayers cannot make a difference because God will do what\nis best for everyone whether or not anyone ever offers petitionary\nprayers for those things. If this were so, then it would seem that\npetitionary prayers are never answered in the sense described\nabove.\n\nIn response to this worry, a number of authors have suggested that it\nwould be better, in some cases, for God to bring certain things about\nin response to petitionary prayers than to bring about those same\nthings independently of any such requests. In order to explore this\nidea, it is helpful to draw a distinction. Sometimes people pray for\nthemselves, and sometimes they pray for others. Let\u2019s call the\nfirst kind of prayer \u201cself-directed,\u201d and let\u2019s call\nthe second kind of prayer \u201cother-directed.\u201d\n\nFirst, consider self-directed prayers. Eleonore Stump argues that in\nsome cases, God waits for us to ask for something before granting it\nin order to avoid spoiling or overwhelming us. We could be spoiled by\nGod if God answered all of our prayers automatically, and we could be\noverwhelmed by God if God provided everything good for us without\nwaiting for us to ask first (Stump 1979). In a similar vein, Michael\nMurray and Kurt Meyers argue that by making the provision of certain\nthings dependent on petitionary prayer, God helps us to avoid\nidolatry, which is a sense of complete self-sufficiency that fails to\nrecognize God as the source of all good things. They also say that\nrequiring petitionary prayer in some cases helps us to learn about\nGod\u2019s will as we recognize the patterns in prayers answered (and\nnot answered: see Murray and Meyers 1994 and section 5 below).\n\nSecond, consider other-directed prayers. Murray and Meyers argue that\nif God makes the provision of certain things for others dependent on\nour prayers for them, then this can help to build interdependence and\ncommunity (Murray and Meyers 1994). By contrast, Richard Swinburne and\nDaniel and Frances Howard-Snyder argue that by requiring petitionary\nprayers in some cases, God gives us more responsibility for the\nwell-being of ourselves and others than we would enjoy otherwise\n(Swinburne 1998, Howard-Snyder and Howard-Snyder 2011). Critics of\nthis approach have wondered whether this involves God using others as\na means to an end (Basinger 1983) or whether this really extends our\nresponsibility for others (Davison 2017, chapter 7).\n\nFinally, some philosophers (for example, Basinger 2004) note that\nthere are a number of ways to understand God\u2019s obligations\ntoward created persons, only some of which suggest that God\u2019s\ngoodness would be compromised if God withheld things because\npetitionary prayers were not offered. So there are a number of\nresponses that theists can make to the puzzle of petitionary prayer\nthat stems from divine moral perfection. (For more on this question,\nsee Davison 2017, chapter 6, and Davison 2022, chapter 4.)\n5. Epistemology\n\nWould it ever be possible to know or reasonably believe that God has\nanswered a particular petitionary prayer? As one might expect,\nphilosophers disagree about this question. Some theists think that for\nall we know, for any particular event that happens, God may have had\nindependent reasons for bringing that event about, so we cannot know\nwhether or not God brought it about because of a prayer (as opposed to\nbringing it about for other reasons\u2014for more on this argument,\nsee Basinger 2004, Davison 2017, chapter 4, Choi 2016, and Davison\n2022, chapter 4). This line of thought is especially interesting in\nlight of the recent popularity of so-called skeptical theism, which\nresponds to the problem of evil by claiming that we can never know\nexactly how particular events are connected with each other and with\ngood or bad consequences, some of which may be beyond our\nunderstanding (see McBrayer 2010, Other Internet Resources). Others\nargue that as long as people are justified in believing, in general\nterms, that God sometimes answers prayers, then it is possible to\nbelieve reasonably that one\u2019s petitionary prayer has been\nanswered when one knows that the thing requested has come to pass (see\nMurray and Meyers 1994, Murray 2004, and Choi 2016).\n\nA number of people have tried to conduct statistical studies to\ndetermine whether or not petitionary prayer is effective. These\nstudies try to measure the differences between groups of people, one\nof which is the subject of petitionary prayers, and the other of which\nis not. Although some earlier studies suggested a positive correlation\nbetween patient recovery and petitionary prayer (see Byrd 1998;\nHarris, et al. 1999; and Leibovici 2001), more recent studies\nhave suggested that the offering of petitionary prayer (and the\nknowledge that such prayers were offered) is not positively correlated\nwith patient recovery (see Benson et al. 2006).\n\nSome have suggested, though, that these kinds of studies are flawed\nfrom the outset (see Br\u00fcmmer 2008 and Davison 2017, chapter 5).\nIt would be difficult to to ensure that some group of people is the\nsubject of no petitionary prayers, for instance, since it is\nimpossible to prevent people from praying for those whom they know.\nAlso, God is typically assumed to be a free person, not a natural\nforce that acts automatically in all similar cases, so we cannot\nassume that God will simply ignore those people for whom petitionary\nprayers have not been offered. This means that even if a study showed\nsome statistically significant difference between the two groups of\npeople, we could not be sure that it was due to the offering of\npetitionary prayers alone, as opposed to some other factor or factors.\n",
