    "main_text": "Critical Concepts || Alienation\n3.1 Alienation\n\nThe concept of alienation has a long history within critical theory.\nThe basic concept refers to the idea of humans being separated,\nestranged, or distanced from something crucial to their freedom or\ncapacity to flourish. One is alienated when one has a distorted or\ndeficient relation to oneself or to the natural or social world.\nCritical theorists face a number of challenges in developing a\ncritique of alienation. Classic critiques of alienation, Rousseau and\nthe early Marx for example, relied on substantive conceptions of human\nnature or self-realization to ground their diagnoses and provide\nstandards for critique. Thick accounts of human nature are less\ncompelling today, which means contemporary critics of alienation have\npursued alternative approaches. Since a critique of alienation\nattempts to diagnose a social pathology, not a problem with particular\nindividuals, critical theorists must also provide a social theory that\ncan convincingly diagnose the social causes of, and possible paths for\novercoming, alienation.\n\nRousseau can be credited with inaugurating \u201csocial\nphilosophy\u201d as a domain of inquiry while developing a critique\nof alienation (Honneth 2000, Ch. 1). Although he does not refer to\nalienation in his \u201cSecond Discourse\u201d (1755), the term\ncaptures his argument that living in society leaves human beings\ndisconnected from their true desires and passions, which he explored\nby speculating about what humans would have been like in a state of\nnature. Within Hegelian and Marxist social criticism, the concept of\nalienation has been used to capture the idea that something produced\nby humans is wrongly taken by them as something given or outside their\nconscious control (Jaeggi 2005 [2014, 13\u201314]). In his\nPhenomenology of Spirit (1807), Hegel first develops a\nconcept of alienation to describe the relation of the human mind to\nreality when the products of human reason are not recognized as our\nown creation but are instead experienced as alien forces. In his\nEconomic and Philosophical Manuscripts (1844), Marx analyzed\nhow wage labor within capitalist societies causes alienation. Workers\nproduce a world of objects, but the products of their labor as well as\ntheir own productive activity are commodities over which they have no\ncontrol; the world they create becomes an alien power with increasing\ncontrol over them. They are alienated from the kind of spontaneous and\ncreative productive activity that Marx, in his early work, posits as\nthe essence of human nature.\n\nThe concept of alienation was influential among first-generation\nFrankfurt School theorists, particularly in the work of Marcuse and\nthe later work of Erich Fromm (1961). In Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno echo Rousseau in telling a\nstory of alienation going back to the dawn of civilization. They\nmaintain that human beings, in their quest to dominate the natural\nworld (external nature) and to acquire mastery over themselves (inner\nnature), become estranged from both aspects of nature, failing to see\nwhat Enlightenment denies: that we are fundamentally natural beings\n(Vogel 1996, 69).\n\nContemporary critical theorists have attempted to rejuvenate the\nconcept of alienation without relying on overly substantive accounts\nof human nature and without the totalizing diagnosis of Dialectic\nof Enlightenment. Rahel Jaeggi formalizes key elements of the\nHegelian-Marxist approach in developing a philosophical account of\nalienation focused on how failure to adequately appropriate oneself or\nthe world results in a \u201crelation of relationlessnes\u201d\n(2005). In this way, the non-alienated self is not defined by a\nsubstantive conception of human nature but by the quality of\none\u2019s relation to the world: whether this relation is sustained\nby successful processes of appropriation. Hartmut Rosa also defines\nalienation as a distorted relation to the world but with a more\nsubstantive approach to the quality of non-alienated relations to the\nworld. For this, he has developed a multifaceted concept of\n\u201cresonance\u201d to capture a kind of vibrant or responsive\nrelation to the world by contrast with the alienated experience of the\nworld as ossified, mute, or hostile (2016). In contrast to these\napproaches, which are largely framed in terms of necessary conditions\nfor living a good life, Rainer Forst has argued that deontological\naspects of the critique of alienation have been neglected, and that\nthere is a kind of \u201cnoumenal alienation\u201d that results from\nnot being recognized, or failing to recognize oneself, as an agent of\njustification (2017).\n",
