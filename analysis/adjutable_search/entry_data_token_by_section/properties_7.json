    "main_text": "Properties: Basic Ideas || Kinds of Properties\n1.7 Kinds of Properties\n\nMany important and often controversial distinctions among different\nkinds of properties have been made throughout the whole history of\nphilosophy until now, often playing key roles in all sorts of disputes\nand arguments, especially in metaphysics. Here we shall briefly review\nsome of these distinctions and others will surface in the following\nsections. More details can be found in other more specialized entries,\nto which we shall refer.\n\nLocke influentially distinguished between primary and\nsecondary qualities; the former are objective features of\nthings, such as shapes, sizes and weights, whereas the latter are\nmind-dependent, e.g., colors, tastes,\nsounds, and smells. This contrast was already\nemphasized by the Greek atomists and was revived in modern times by\nGalileo, Descartes, and Boyle.\n\nAt least since Aristotle, the essential properties of an\nobject have been contrasted with its accidental properties;\nthe object could not exist without the former, whereas it could fail\nto have the latter (see entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties).\n Among essential properties, some acknowledge individual\nessences (also called \u201chaecceities\u201d or\n\u201cthisnesses\u201d), which univocally characterize a certain\nindividual. Adams (1979) conceives of such properties as involving,\nvia the identity relation, the very individual in question, e.g.,\nSocrates: being identical to Socrates, which cannot exist if\nSocrates does not exist. In contrast, Plantinga (1974) views them as\ncapable of existing without the individuals of which they are\nessences, e.g., Socratizing, which could have existed even if\nSocrates had not existed. See\n \u00a75.2\n on the issue of the essences of properties themselves.\n\nSortal properties are typically\nexpressed by count nouns like \u201cdesk\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d\nand are taken to encode principles of individuation and persistence\nthat allow us to objectively count objects. For example, there is a\nfact of the matter regarding how many things in this room instantiate\nbeing a desk and being a cat. On the other hand,\nnon-sortal properties such as red or water do not\nallow us to count in a similarly obvious way. This distinction is\noften appealed to in contemporary metaphysics (P. Strawson 1959: ch.\n5, \u00a72; Armstrong 1978a: ch. 11, \u00a74), where, in contrast, the\ntraditional one between genus and\n species\n plays a relatively small role. The latter figured conspicuously in\nAristotle and in much subsequent philosophy inspired by him. We can\nview a genus as a property more general than a corresponding species\nproperty, in a hierarchically relative manner. For example, being\na mammal is a genus relative to the species being a\nhuman, but it is a species relative to the genus being an\nanimal. The possession of a property called differentia\nis appealed to in order to distinguish between different species\nfalling under a common genus; e.g., as the tradition has it, the\ndifferentia for being human is being rational (Aristotle,\nCategories, 3a). Similar hierarchies of properties, however\nwithout anything like differentiae, come with the distinction of\n determinables and determinates,\n which appears to be\nmore prominent in current metaphysics. Color properties provide\ntypical examples of such hierarchies, e.g., with red and\nscarlet as determinable and determinate, respectively.\n",
