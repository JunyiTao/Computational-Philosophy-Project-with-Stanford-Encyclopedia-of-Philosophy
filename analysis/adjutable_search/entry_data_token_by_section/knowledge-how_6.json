    "main_text": "The Gradability Argument\n3. The Gradability Argument\n\nRyle (1949: 46) formulates the argument from gradability thus: \n\n\nwe never speak of a person having partial knowledge of a fact or truth\n\u2026 it is proper and normal to speak of a person knowing in part\nhow to do something. Learning how or improving in ability is not like\nlearning that or acquiring information. Truths can be imparted,\nprocedures can only be inculcated, and while inculcation is a gradual\nprocess, imparting is relatively sudden.\n\n\nAs Kremer (2020: 102) points out, here Ryle is making two\ndistinguishable points: (i) ascriptions of knowledge-how are gradable,\nwhereas ascriptions of know-that are not; (ii) the gradability of\nthese ascriptions is explained by the fact that knowledge-how must\ncome in degrees, because learning-how brings improvement in\nknowledge-how. There is no parallel phenomenon in learning-that, and\nso no need for degrees of knowledge-that. Others have followed Ryle in\nthinking that the gradability argument shows intellectualism wrong.\nFor example, Bengson and Moffett (2011b) argue that because\nknowledge-how is gradable, knowledge-how is more similar to\nacquaintance knowledge, which also comes in degrees (see also Ryle\n1949: 46; Wiggins 2012; Santorio 2016; Kremer 2020: 102). \n\nPavese (2017) distinguishes between two kinds of gradability of\nknowledge-how ascriptions: one might know how to do something in part\nor entirely (quantitative gradability) or one might know how to do\nsomething better than somebody else (qualitative gradability).\nCrucially, these two kinds of gradability are also present more\ngenerally in other knowledge-wh (knowledge-when, who, why, where)\nascriptions, which do seem to reduce to propositional knowledge. For\ninstance, one might know in part who came to the party\n(Lahiri 1991, 2000; Roberts 2009) or know a better answer to that\nquestion than somebody else (see also Stanley 2011b: 31\u20135). If\nparts of an answer are propositions, then knowing an answer might\nstill amount to knowledge of all of its parts. Knowing in part an\nanswer would then amount to knowing at least one of the propositions\nthat is part of that answer. Similarly, knowing a better answer\namounts to knowing a proposition that better answers the relevant\nquestion. If this is true of other knowledge-wh ascriptions, it is\ncertainly plausible that it is true for knowledge-how. One might know\nhow to \u03a6 in part by knowing only certain (propositional) parts of\nthe answer to \u201chow does one \u03a6?\u201d and one might know a\nbetter answer to that question than someone else. \n\nThis response to the first part of the gradability objection inspires\na further response to the second part concerning learning-how. Suppose\nthat knowledge-how is a matter of knowing a practical answer, where a\npractical answer encompasses a practical representation for a task or\na way to \u03a6\n (section 2).\n As we have seen, practically representing requires possessing certain\npractical capacities and entails certain sorts of abilities. On this\npicture, one might gradually learn how to perform a task by gradually\nlearning a practical answer to that question, for one requires time\nand practice to master a practical representation of how to perform\nthe task. Thus, gradual learning may be compatible with the\nintellectualist picture, if it amounts to gradually coming to learn\nmore parts of a practical answer.\n",
