    "main_text": "Further Issues || Manipulating Persons versus Manipulating Situations\n4.1 Manipulating Persons versus Manipulating Situations\n\nDiscussions of manipulation often distinguish between cases where the\nmanipulator influences his target directly, and cases where the\nmanipulator influences the target\u2019s behavior by arranging the\ntarget\u2019s environment in ways that induce her to act one way\nrather than another. Consider Joel Rudinow\u2019s example of a\nmalingerer who manipulates a psychiatrist into admitting him to the\npsychiatric ward (Rudinow 1978). He does this by fooling a police\nofficer into thinking he is about to commit suicide. The police\nofficer brings him to the ward, reports that he is suicidal, and\nrequests that he be admitted. Although the psychiatrist is not fooled,\nher hospital\u2019s rules force her to admit the malingerer at the\npolice officer\u2019s request. It seems clear that the malingerer has\nmanipulated the police officer by tricking him into adopting a faulty\nbelief. But the psychiatrist, while not falling for the feigned\nsuicide attempt and thus not adopting any faulty beliefs, is\nnevertheless induced to do what she did not want to do. Although it\nseems correct to say that the psychiatrist was manipulated, this form\nof manipulation seems different from what was done to the police\nofficer. By feigning a suicide attempt, the malingerer has tampered\nwith the police officer\u2019s beliefs. But he has maneuvered the\npsychiatrist into admitting him, not by tampering with her\npsychological states, but rather by \u201cgaming the system\u201d,\nas we might say.\n\nIn his book, The Art of Political Manipulation (Riker 1986)\nthe political scientist William Riker calls the latter form of\nmanipulation \u201cheresthetic,\u201d and characterizes it as\n\u201cstructuring the world so you can win\u201d (1986: ix). His\nfocus is on political tactics like gerrymandering, poison pill\namendments, and strategic voting, all of which are often described as\nmanipulation, and all of which seem more like what Rudinow\u2019s\nmalingerer does to the psychiatrist than what he does to the police\nofficer.\n\nIn a similar way, the sociologists Donald Warwick and Herbert Kelman\ndistinguish between \u201cenvironmental\u201d and\n\u201cpsychic\u201d manipulation (Warwick & Kelman 1973). Their\nwork influenced Faden, Beauchamp, and King\u2019s seminal\nphilosophical account of manipulation, which makes a similar\ndistinction (Faden, Beauchamp, & King 1986: 355\u201368). Anne\nBarnhill distinguishes between manipulation that \u201cchanges the\noptions available to the person or changes the situation she\u2019s\nin, and thereby changes her attitudes\u201d on the one hand, and\nmanipulation that \u201cchanges a person\u2019s attitudes directly\nwithout changing the options available to her or the surrounding\nsituation\u201d on the other (Barnhill 2014: 53). Drawing a similar\ndistinction, Claudia Mills writes\n\n\nIf A wants to get B to do act x, there are two\ngeneral strategies that A might undertake. A might\nchange, or propose to change, the external or objective features of\nB\u2019s choice situation; or alternatively, A\nmight try to alter certain internal or subjective features of\nB\u2019s choice situation. While some writers might call\nboth strategies manipulative, at least in certain circumstances, I\nprefer to reserve the label manipulation for a subset of\nmorally problematic actions falling in the second category. (Mills\n1995: 97)\n\n\nAlthough Rudinow\u2019s case provides a clear contrast between what\nwe might call psychological manipulation and situational manipulation,\nthis distinction\u2014or at least its importance\u2014is not always\nso clear. Consider\n tactic 9\n above, where Irving threatens to withdraw his friendship if Tonya\ndoes not do as Irving wishes. Is this direct psychological\nmanipulation, or situational manipulation? The criterion offered by\nBarnhill and others counts it as situational manipulation, since\nIrving changes Tonya\u2019s choice situation so that doing Y and\nretaining Irving\u2019s friendship is no longer an option. But how is\nthis tactic any less of a direct interference with Tonya\u2019s\ndecision than if Irving had engaged in some form of deception? Why\nwould it be more like what the malingerer does to the police officer\nthan what he does to the psychiatrist?\n\nThis is not to deny that there is a difference between psychological\nand situational manipulation. Instead, it is to ask what that\ndifference is, and why it might matter. Presumably, the distinction is\nmeant to differentiate between tactics that affect a target\u2019s\nbehavior by directly tampering with her psychology and those that do\nnot. But if this is the distinction, then it seems plausible to think\nthat Irving\u2019s use of emotional blackmail is at least as direct a\ntampering with Tonya\u2019s psychology as, say, Iago\u2019s dropping\nof the handkerchief in a location where it will trick Othello into\nbecoming inappropriately suspicious. Yet criteria like those proposed\nby Mills and Barnhill seem to imply that these two forms of\nmanipulation are on opposite sides of that distinction.\n\nNevertheless, there does seem something importantly different between\nwhat the malingerer in Rudinow\u2019s example does to the police\nofficer and what he does to the psychiatrist. But much work remains to\nbe done to provide a well-motivated account of that difference. Such\nan account should not only get the intuitively right answers in cases\nof direct pressure (like emotional blackmail) and indirect deception\n(like Iago\u2019s dropping the handkerchief), but it should also\nexplain whether and why the distinction makes a moral difference.\n",
