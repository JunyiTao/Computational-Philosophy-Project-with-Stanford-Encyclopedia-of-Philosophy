    "main_text": "Criticisms of Experimental Moral Philosophy || Problems with Experimental Design and Interpretation\n5.1 Problems with Experimental Design and Interpretation\n\nAs a young field, experimental philosophy suffers from various\nproblems with experimental design and interpretation. These are not\ninsurmountable problems (Machery & Doris 2017), and they are\nproblems faced by related fields, such as social psychology, cognitive\npsychology, and behavioral economics.\n\nOne issue that has recently come to the fore is the problem of\nreplication (Romero\n 2019).[14]\n Statistical analysis is not deductive inference, and the mere fact\nthat statistical analysis yields a positive result does not guarantee\nthat anything has been discovered. Typically, an experimental result\nis only treated as \u201creal\u201d if its p-value\nis at most .05, but such a value just\nindicates, roughly, the probability that the observation in question\nor a more extreme observation would have been made if the null\nhypothesis were true. It is not the probability that the null\nhypothesis is false given the\n observation.[15]\n So, even when statistical analysis indicates that the null hypothesis\nis to be rejected, that indication can be erroneous, and the null\nhypothesis might still be quite plausible. \n\nWe should also expect other failures of replication because of a bias\nbuilt into the system of funding experimentation and publishing\nresults. Since experimentalists are reluctant to report (and even\ndiscouraged by journal editors and referees from reporting) null\nresults (i.e., results where the p-value is more\nthan .05), for every published result there may be any number of\nunpublished non-results (Rosenthal 1979).\n\nAnother worry is that simultaneously testing many intuition-probes can\nlead unwary experimenters on fishing expeditions. Suppose an\nexperimental philosopher conducts an experiment with two conditions:\nin the experimental condition, participants are primed with\ndeterministic ideas, while in the control condition they are not\nprimed one way or another. She asks participants twenty different\nquestions about their moral intuitions, for instance, whether there is\nfree will, whether malefactors deserve to be punished, whether virtue\ndeserves to be rewarded, and so on. She then makes pairwise\ncomparisons of their responses to each of the questions in an attempt\nto figure out whether deterministic priming induces changes in moral\nintuitions. She thus makes twenty independent comparisons, each at the\nindustry-standard 5% level. Suppose now for the sake of argument that\nthere is no effect\u2014that all null hypotheses are true. In that\ncase, the probability that at least one of these tests will result in\na Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis even though it is true)\nis 64%. More generally, when an experimenter performs n\nindependent comparisons at the 5% level, the\nprobability of at least one Type I error is \\(1-.95^n\\). This problem\ncan be addressed by various procedures, most notably the Tukey method\nand the Bonferroni\n method.[16]\n\nMultiple testing without correction is a form of\np-hacking (Simmons, Nelson & Simohnson 2011).\n\u201cP-hacking\u201d refers to a family of practices that increase\nthe probability of obtaining a significant result by capitalizing on\nchance, such as dropping outliers, testing statistical models with and\nwithout covariates, and uncorrected multiple testing. While p-hacking\nmight be surprisingly frequent in psychology (John, Loewenstein\n& Prelec 2012), it appears rare in experimental\nphilosophy (Stuart, Cola\u00e7o & Machery 2018). \n\nThe best way to tell whether such a result carries any evidential\nvalue is for the experiment to be replicated\u2014preferably by\nanother research group. If a result cannot be robustly replicated, it\nis probably a mirage. Such mirages have turned up to a disturbing\nextent recently, as Daniel Kahneman has famously pointed out (Yong\n2012; see also Wagenmakers et al. 2012). Kahneman proposed a\n\u201cdaisy chain\u201d of replication, where no result in\npsychology would be published until it had been successfully\nreplicated by another prominent lab. This proposal has not yet been\n(and may never be) instituted, but it has raised the problem of\nreplication to salience, and a related project has taken off. The\nreproducibility project in psychology aims to establish the extent to\nwhich prominent, published results can be\n replicated.[17]\n Experimental philosophers have followed suit with their own\nreplication project (see the Other Internet Resources). This work has\nrecently yielded encouraging fruit: a large collaborative replication\neffort suggests that approximately 7 out of 10 experimental philosophy\nresults can be reproduced, whereas similar efforts show that less than\nhalf of the results in biomedicine, economics, and psychology are\nreplicable (Cova et al. 2021, Other Internet Resources). On the other\nhand, as discussed throughout this entry, many influential\nexperimental studies in moral psychology have failed to\nreplicate. \n",
