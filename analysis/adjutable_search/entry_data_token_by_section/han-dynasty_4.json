    "main_text": "Western Han (202 BCE\u20139 CE) || Human Nature: Yang Xiong\n2.4 Human Nature: Yang Xiong\n\nYang Xiong (53 BCE\u201318 CE) was one of the last major\nphilosophical figures before the end of the Western Han Dynasty, whose\nlife spanned into the short-lived \u201cinterregnum\u201d period of\nWang Mang\u2019s Xin Dynasty (9\u201323 CE). Yang\u2019s\nlate work represents a crucial pivot point toward the new kind of\nphilosophical thought that would come to dominate in the Eastern Han\nperiod. Though the naturalism of the early Han remained, later Han\nthought moved back toward the kind of metaphysically sparse realism of\nthe pre-Han period, away from the elaborate correlative systems of the\nearlier Han. Yang Xiong\u2019s Fayan (\u201cModel\nSayings\u201d) returns to the style and ideas of early texts such as\nthe Analects.\n\nWhile Yang\u2019s early scholarly reputation was based on his\nfu poems (a genre of polemic poetry generally aimed at\ninfluencing political policy during this time), his best known work\ntoday is his philosophical work, produced later in his life. The\nearlier of these texts, the Taixuanjing (\u201cClassic of\nSupreme Mystery\u201d) is a very much continuous with the correlative\nmetaphysical trends of earlier Han philosophy. The text is an\ndivinatory and philosophical manual in the style of the early\ndivination classic Yijing, and develops a similar correlative\nmetaphysics to ones found in earlier texts such as Chunqiu\nFanlu and Huainanzi. Fayan, perhaps his most\nfamous work, was one of his later works, written during period of Wang\nMang\u2019s Xin Dynasty. While this work is innovative in its return\nto an older style of presentation as well as its presentation of new\ntheories of xing \u6027 (human nature/inborn\ncharacteristics), moral cultivation, and political organization,\nit\u2019s legacy led to the sidelining of Yang Xiong in the later\nChinese tradition. Song Dynasty Neo-Confucians such as Zhu Xi\n(1130\u20131200 CE) criticized Yang on the basis of what they saw as\nthe presumptuousness of his use of the style of the Analects\nfor the construction of Fayan. Because of this, Yang\u2019s\nwork was not included as one of the essential Confucian texts by these\nlater scholars, and this led to the neglect of Yang\u2019s work from\nthis time, given the influence of the Neo-Confucians (Nylan 2014:\n2).\n\nThe correlative model of the Taixuanjing, as it follows in\ngeneral the kind of \u201cFive Phases\u201d thought found in earlier\nworks, is presented in the style of the Yijing, as short\ndescriptions of divinatory tetragrams. It is a notoriously difficult\ntext, written in the same terse, poetic, and suggestive way as the\nYijing itself, and its main focus is divinatory, although\nYang develops some philosophical positions in the text as well.\n\nArguably the most well-known of Yang\u2019s philosophical positions\nis his view of xing \u6027 (human nature/inborn\ncharacteristics), a view later criticized by Neo-Confucians in the\nSong Dynasty because of its inconsistency with Mengzi\u2019s view,\nwhich had by that time become the \u201corthodox\u201d Confucian\nposition. Contrary to the earlier Confucian philosophers Mengzi and\nXunzi, Yang held that human inborn characteristics contain both good\nand evil, and that moral development is a matter of cultivating the\ngood aspects of it, while allowing the evil elements to wither. The\nfact that a particular characteristic is inborn or part of our nature,\naccording to Yang, does not necessitate that we act according to it.\nHumans have the ability (through ritual and other tools) to shape our\ndispositions. Agreeing with earlier Confucians, Yang argues that what\nis contained in our nature must be developed in order to become either\nvirtue or vice. The contents of our nature can be called good or evil,\nbut an individual only becomes virtuous or vicious in connection with\nthese characteristics once they are developed. The key passage in\nFayan reads:\n\n\nHuman xing is a mixture of good and evil. If one cultivates\nthe good aspects one becomes good, while if one cultivates the evil\naspects one becomes evil. As for qi\u2014is it not the horse\nthat carries one to either good or evil? (Fayan 3.2,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n",
