Metaphysical and Religious Philosophy\n\nAlthough the metaphysics of Weil\u2019s later thought was both\nChristian and Platonic, and therefore graceful and supernatural, her\nturn to God occurred not despite but, rather, because of her attention\nto reality and contact with the world. It is not the case, then, that\nher spiritual turn and \u201ctheological commitment\u201d\n(Springsted 2015: 1\u20132) severed her contact with her early\nmaterialism, solidarities, or Marxian considerations; rather, her\nspiritual turn occurred within this context, which would ground the\nreligious philosophy she would subsequently articulate.\n\nIn her late thought Weil presents an original creation theology. God,\nas purely good, infinite, and eternal, withdrew (or reduced Godself)\nso that something else (something less than fully good, finite, and\nspatio-temporally determinate) could exist, namely, the universe.\nImplicit in this outside-of-God universe is a contingency of forces.\nShe calls this principle of contingency, the \u201cweb of\ndeterminations\u201d (McCullough 2014: 124) contrary to God,\n\u201cnecessity\u201d. Necessity is \u201cthe screen\u201d\n(l\u2019\u00e9cran) placed between God and creatures. Here\nher creation metaphysics echoes Plato\u2019s distinction between the\nnecessary and the good in the Timaeus. Her Christian\ninflection translates this to the \u201csupreme contradiction\u201d\nbetween creature and creator; \u201cit is Christ who represents the\nunity of these contradictories\u201d (NB 386).\n\nWeil is clear that God and the world is less than God alone, yet that\nonly heightens the meaning of God\u2019s abdication. That is, out of\nlove (for what would be the world and the creatures therein), God\ndecided to be lesser. Because existence\u2014God\u2019s very denial\nof Godself\u2014is itself a mark of God\u2019s love, providence is\ntherefore not found in particular interventions of God, but understood\nby recognizing the universe in all its contingency as the sum of\nGod\u2019s intentions. In this theology rests an implication for\ncreatures. If humans are to imitate God, then they must also renounce\ntheir autonomy (including imagined \u201ccenteredness\u201d in the\nuniverse) and power out of love for God and therefore the world; she\ncalls this \u201cdecreation\u201d\n(d\u00e9cr\u00e9ation), which she describes paradoxically\nby \u201cpassive activity\u201d (WFG 126) and, drawing on her\nreadings of the Bhagavad Gita, \u201cnon-active\naction\u201d (NB 124).\n\nWeil articulates her religious philosophy through a series of\ndistinctions\u2014of oppositions or contradictions. It is important\nto read the distinctions she makes not as positing dualisms, but as\nsuggesting contraries that are, unsynthesized, themselves mediations\nthrough which the soul is drawn upward. Her concept of\n\u201cintermediaries\u201d\u2014or metaxu\n(\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03cd), the Greek term she employs in\nher notebooks\u2014becomes explicit beginning in 1939. Through\nmetaxu God is indirectly present in the world\u2014for\nexample, in beauty, cultural traditions, law, and labor\u2014all of\nwhich place us into contact with reality. In terms of her\nperiodization, her concept of mediation moved from relations of mind\nand matter on the level of the natural (found in the early Weil) to a\nmediation relating the natural intelligence to attention and love on\nthe level of the supernatural (at work in the late Weil), thus\nencompassing her early view through a universal perspective.\n\nGiven that reality is itself metaxu, Weil\u2019s late\nconcept of mediation is more universal than the aforementioned\nspecific examples suggest. For her the real (le r\u00e9el)\nitself is an obstacle that represents contradiction, an obstacle felt,\nsay, in a difficult idea, in the presence of another, or in physical\nlabor; thus thought comes into contact with necessity and must\ntransform contradiction into correlation or mysterious and crucifying\nrelation, resulting in spiritual edification. Her explanation of this\nmediation is based on her idiosyncratic cosmology, especially its\nparadoxical claim that what is often painful reality, as distance from\nGod, is also, as intermediate, connection to God. She illustrates this\nclaim with the following metaphor:\n\n\nTwo prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by\nknocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but\nit is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and\nGod. Every separation is a link. (GG 145)\n\n\nWhen developing her concept of the real, Weil is especially interested\nin distinguishing it from the imaginary. The\nimagination\u2014problematized on epistemological grounds in her\nearly thought\u2014is criticized once again in her religious\nphilosophy for its insidious tendency to pose false consolations that\nat once invite idolatry or self-satisfaction, both of which obviate\nreal contemplation. This is why decreation, in which the individual\nwithdraws her or his \u201cI\u201d and personal perspective so as to\nallow the real and others to give themselves, is crucial not only\nspiritually, but also epistemologically and ethically. It is,\nadditionally and more radically, why Weil suggests that atheism can be\na kind of purification insofar as it negates religious consolation\nthat fills the void. For those for whom religion amounts to an\nimagined \u201cGod who smiles on [them]\u201d (GG 9), atheism\nrepresents a necessary detachment. Crucially, for her, love is pure\nnot in the name of a personal God or its particular image, but only\nwhen it is anonymous and universal.\n\nThe real leads us back to the aforementioned concept of\n\u201cnecessity\u201d, for reality\u2014essentially determinate,\nlimited, contingent, and conditional\u2014is itself a \u201cnetwork\nof necessity\u201d (Vet\u00f6 1971 [1994: 90]), such that necessity\nis a reflection of reality. Moreover, like \u201cpower\u201d in her\nearly period and \u201cforce\u201d in her middle period,\nWeil\u2019s concept of necessity includes not only the physical\nforces of the created world, but also the social forces of human life.\nThrough necessity a sense of slavery remains in her thought, for\nhumans are ineluctably subject to necessity. In this way, enslavement\nto forces outside our control is essentially woven into the human\ncondition.\n\nTime, contrary to God as eternal, along with space and matter, is\nfirst of all the most basic form of necessity. In its constant\nreminder of distance from God, and in the experiences of enduring and\nwaiting, time is also painful. Weil\u2019s Christian Platonism comes\nto light in the two most poignant metaphors she uses to refer to time,\nnamely, the (Platonic) Cave and the (Christian) Cross. In both cases,\ntime is the weight or the pull of necessity, through which the soul,\nin any effort of the self, feels vulnerable, contingent, and\nunavoidably subject to necessity\u2019s mediation here below\n(ici-bas). Time, then, is both the Cave where the self\npursues its illusory goals of expansion into the future and the Cross\nwhere necessity, a sign of God\u2019s love, pins the self, suffering\nand mortal, to the world.\n\nImportantly, by 1942 in New York, Weil\u2019s concept of time aligns\nwith Plato\u2019s against what she sees as Christian emphasis on\nprogress:\n\n\nChristianity was responsible for bringing this notion of progress,\npreviously unknown, into the world; and this notion, become the bane\nof the modern world, has de-Christianized it. We must abandon the\nnotion. We must get rid of our superstition of chronology in order to\nfind Eternity. (LPr 29)\n\n\nFor Weil progress does not carry normative implications of\nimprovement, for the Good is eternal and non-existent (in that it is\nneither spatial nor temporal); time must be consented to and suffered,\nnot fled. As for Christ on the cross, for creatures there is\nredemption not from but through suffering. She thus presents a\nsupernatural use of, not a remedy for, affliction. One form of sin,\nthen, is an attempt to escape time, for only God is time-out-of-mind.\nHowever, time, paradoxically, can also serve as metaxu. While\nmonotony is dreadful and fatiguing when it is in the form of a\npendulum\u2019s swinging or a factory\u2019s work, it is beautiful\nas a reflection of eternity, in the form of a circle (which unites\nbeing and becoming) or the sound of Gregorian chant. This beauty of\nthe world suggests, when read from the detached perspective, order\nbehind necessity, and God behind order.\n\nA second form of necessity is \u201cgravity\u201d\n(pesanteur), as distinct from supernatural\n\u201cgrace\u201d. Gravity signifies the forces of the natural world\nthat subject all created beings physically, materially,\npsychologically, and socially, and thus functions as a downward\n\u201cpull\u201d on the attention, away from God and the afflicted.\n\u201cGrace\u201d, on the other hand, is a counter-balance, the\nmotivation by and goodness of God. Grace pierces the world of\nnecessity and serves to orient, harmonize, and balance, thus providing\na kind of \u201csupernatural bread\u201d for satiating the human\nvoid. Grace, entering the empirical world, disposes one to be purified\nby leaving the void open, waiting for a good that is real but that\ncould never \u201cexist\u201d in a material sense (i.e., as subject\nto time, change, force, etc.). For Weil, natural/necessary gravity\n(force) and supernatural/spiritual grace (justice) are the two\nfundamental aspects of the created world, coming together most\nprominently in the crucifixion. The shape of the cross itself reflects\nthis intersection of the horizontal (necessity) and the vertical\n(grace).\n\nWeil\u2019s concept of necessity bears on her late conceptualization\nof the subject. She connects seeing oneself as central to the world to\nseeing oneself as exempt from necessity. From this perspective, if\nsomething were to befall oneself, then the world would cease to have\nimportance; therefore, the assertive and willful self concludes,\nnothing could befall oneself. Affliction contradicts this perspective\nand thus forcefully de-centers the self. Unlike her existentialist\ncontemporaries such as Sartre, Weil did not think human freedom\nprincipally through agency; for her, humans are free not ontologically\nas a presence-to-self but supernaturally through obedience and\nconsent. More than obedience, consent is the unity of necessity in\nmatter with freedom in creatures. A creature cannot not obey;\nthe only choice for the intelligent creature is to desire or not to\ndesire the good. To desire the good\u2014and here her stoicism\nthrough Marcus Aurelius and Spinoza emerges in her own appeal to\namor fati\u2014is a disposition that implies a consent to\nnecessity and a love of the order of the world, both of which mean\naccepting divine will. Consent, therefore, is a kind of reconciliation\nin her dialectic between the necessary and the good. Consent does not\nfollow from effort or will; rather, it expresses an ontological\nstatus, namely, decreation. In supernatural compassion one loves\nthrough evil: through distance (space) and through monotony\n(time), attending in a void and through the abdication of God. Thus,\nin regard to contradiction and mediation, just as the intelligence\nmust grapple with mystery in Weil\u2019s epistemology, so too love\nmust be vulnerable and defenseless in the face of evil in her\nmetaphysical and religious philosophy.\n",
