    "main_text": "Guiding commitments || Universal intelligibility\n1.1 Universal intelligibility\n\nOne of Spinoza\u2019s most fundamental epistemological and\nmethodological commitments is a commitment to universal\nintelligibility. In his most influential treatise, the\nEthics, Spinoza expresses this commitment in two ways: first,\nas the axiom that there is nothing that cannot be\n\u201cconceived\u201d, either \u201cthrough itself\u201d or\nthrough \u201canother thing\u201d (Ethics [=\nE] 1ax2); second, as the claim that there is a\n\u201creason or [i.e.] cause\u201d for the \u201cexistence\nor nonexistence\u201d of every thing (E1p11atld1).\n\nThese formulations immediately raise several questions. What does it\nmean for something to be conceived \u201cthrough itself\u201d, i.e.,\nin some sense be self-explanatory? Does the equivalence of\ncauses and reasons suggested by E1p11altd1 mean that only appeals to\ncauses can furnish reasons? Indeed, what counts as a\n\u201creason\u201d (cf. Lin 2018)? It\u2019s often assumed that in\nSpinoza\u2019s view to give a \u201creason\u201d for something\nrequires engaging in the sort of apriori deductions that fill large\nswathes of the Ethics. The opening definition of the\ntreatise, according to which something is a \u201ccause of\nitself\u201d if its existence is implied by its essence (E1def1),\nsuggests that at least some of the relevant \u201creasons\u201d will\nindeed be accessible apriori. But could sense experience also furnish\nus with reasons? Is seeing my dog play with a stick enough of a\n\u201creason\u201d to \u201cconceive\u201d of her as existing, or\nmust I deduce her necessary existence from the infinitely long series\nof prior causes (E1p28), a task Spinoza admits is impossible for\nfinite minds like ours (Treatise on the Emendation of the\nIntellect [= TIE] \u00a7100)?\n\nControversially but influentially, Michael Della Rocca 2008 has argued\nthat Spinoza\u2019s philosophy as a whole can be derived from his\ncommitment to intelligibility. (For criticisms see e.g. Laerke 2011,\nNewlands 2018, Renz 2018.)\n",
