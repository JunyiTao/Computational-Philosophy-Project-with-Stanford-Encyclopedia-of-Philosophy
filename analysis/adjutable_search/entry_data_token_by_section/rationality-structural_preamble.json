    "main_text": "\n\nMany paradigm instances of irrationality involve one\u2019s mental\nstates failing to cohere with one another, in a fairly broad sense of\n \u2018cohere\u2019.[1]\n For example, it\u2019s commonly thought to be irrational to hold\n(obviously) inconsistent beliefs \u2013 say, to believe that you are\na great cook, to believe that great cooks never overcook eggs, and yet\nto believe that you have overcooked the eggs. These three beliefs are\njointly incoherent. Similarly, many central instances of practical\nirrationality, such as instrumental irrationality, can be thought of\nas instances of incoherence: it is incoherent to simultaneously intend\nto shop for groceries today, believe that to shop for groceries today\nyou must get on your bike now, but yet not intend to get on your bike\nnow.\u00a0In recent years, many philosophers have come to refer to\nthese incoherence-involving\u00a0instances of irrationality as forms\nof \u2018structural irrationality\u2019, and to call the property of\nhaving mental states that\u00a0do\u00a0cohere with one\nanother properly \u2018structural rationality\u2019.\n\nStructural rationality is often contrasted with \u2018substantive\nrationality\u2019, which is typically understood in terms of\nresponsiveness to normative reasons. So, for example, when we say that\nit isn\u2019t rational to (intend to) gamble one\u2019s life savings\non the outcome of a horse race, this seems to reflect the existence of\nstrong normative reasons against gambling (or intending to gamble)\none\u2019s life savings on the outcome of the race, rather than\npinpointing any incoherence that must be present in the mental states\nof anyone who gambles her life savings on the outcome of the race.\nSimilarly, when we say it isn\u2019t rational to believe in\nastrology, this seems to reflect a judgment that there are strong\nnormative reasons \u2013 presumably supplied by the available\nevidence \u2013 against believing in astrology, rather than presuming\nthat anyone who believes in astrology must be incoherent.\n\nThis entry is composed of three sections. In \u00a71, we survey\ndebates about what structural rationality is, including the emergence\nof the concept in the contemporary literature, its key\ncharacteristics, its relationship to substantive rationality, its\nparadigm instances, and the questions of whether these instances are\nunified and, if so, how. In \u00a72, we turn to the debate about\nstructural requirements of rationality \u2013 including\ncontroversies about whether they are \u201cwide-scope\u201d or\n\u201cnarrow-scope\u201d, synchronic or diachronic, and whether they\ngovern processes or states; as well as examining various forms of\nskepticism about structural requirements of rationality. In \u00a73,\nwe turn to the debate about the normative significance of structural\nrationality, surveying central challenges for the view that structural\nrationality is normatively significant and the theoretical options\nthat arise in light of these challenges.\n",
