    "main_text": "Life || Life as an Event\n1.2 Life as an Event\n\nAs Jay Rosenberg noted (1983, p. 22, 103), sometimes when we speak of\na life we mean to refer to the events that make up something\u2019s\nhistory\u2014the things that it did and the things that happened to\nit. (For example, the publication of The Problems of\nPhilosophy was one of the events that made up one life, namely\nBertrand Russell\u2019s.) Yet a rock and a corpse have histories, and\nneither has a life. Presumably, then, \u2018a life,\u2019 in the\nsense we are discussing, refers to the history of something that is\nalive. In that case what we are really looking for is clarification of\na property, not an event. We want clarification of what it is to be\nalive.\n\nAccording to a second theorist, Peter van Inwagen, while a life is\nindeed an event, it is not the history of something.\n\u201c\u2018Russell\u2019s life,\u2019\u201d van Inwagen writes\n(1990, p. 83), \u201cdenotes a purely biological event, an event\nwhich took place entirely inside Russell\u2019s skin and which went\non for ninety-seven years.\u201d Russell\u2019s life included the\noxygenation of his hemoglobin molecules but not the publication of his\nbooks.\n\nIf lives are biological events, it would be useful to know more about\nwhat they are, how they are individuated, and what their persistence\nconditions are. Van Inwagen declines to provide these details (1990,\np. 145). He assumes that (the events he calls) lives are familiar\nenough to us that we can pick them out. But he does make the useful\ncomment that each such event is constituted by certain self-organizing\nactivities in which some molecules engage, and that it is analogous to\na parade, which is an event constituted by certain marching-related\nactivities of some people. Having taken the notion of a life for\ngranted, he draws upon it in his account of organisms. On his view\n(1990, p. 90), some things compose an organism if and only if their\nactivity constitutes a life.\n",
