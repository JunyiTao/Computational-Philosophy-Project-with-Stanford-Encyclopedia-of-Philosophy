    "main_text": "Work on Tense Logic || Origins of Tense Logic\n1.1 Origins of Tense Logic\n\n\nPrior\u2019s earliest mention of a logic of time-distinctions is to\nbe found in the penultimate chapter of his unpublished manuscript\nThe Craft of Formal Logic. The Craft, completed in\n1951 (Prior 1951), was intended to be his first book on formal logic.\nFollowing von Wright in \u2018Deontic Logic\u2019 (von Wright 1951b),\nPrior remarked that there are other groups of modal predicates to be\nset alongside the ordinary or \u2018alethic\u2019 modes of necessity\nand possibility. He referred to these non-alethic modalities as\n\u2018quasi-modals\u2019. After noting that Peter of Spain classified\nadverbial distinctions of time as modes, he said:\n\n\n\nThat there should be a modal logic of time-distinctions has been\nsuggested in our own day by Professor Findlay. (1951: 750)\n\n\n\nFindlay\u2019s paper \u2018Time: A Treatment of Some\nPuzzles\u2019 had appeared in the Australasian Journal of\nPsychology and Philosophy in 1941. Prior became aware of it as a\nresult of its appearance in Flew\u2019s 1951 collection Essays on\nLogic and Language, which arrived in New Zealand just as Prior was\nwriting the final chapters of The Craft. The suggestion Prior\nreferred to is barely more than a passing comment: \u2018[O]ur\nconventions with regard to tenses are so well worked out that we have\npractically the materials in them for a formal calculus\u2019, wrote\nFindlay. He continued in a footnote:\n\n\n\nThe calculus of tenses should have been included in the modern\ndevelopment of modal logics. It includes such obvious propositions as\nthat\n\n\n\n\\(x\\) present \\(\\leftrightarrow(x\\) present) present;\n\n\n\\(x\\) future \\(\\leftrightarrow(x\\) future) present \\(\\leftrightarrow \n(x\\) present) future;\n\n\n\nalso such comparatively recondite propositions as that\n\n\n\n\\((x).(x\\) past) future; i.e., all events, past,\npresent and future, will be past.\n\n\n\n\nPrior\u2019s discovery of Findlay\u2019s footnote followed hard on\nthe heels of another discovery. In 1949 he learned (from Geach\u2019s\nreview of Julius Weinberg\u2019s Nicolaus of Autricourt: A Study\nin 14th Century Thought) that, for the scholastics, an expression\nlike \u2018Socrates is sitting down\u2019\u2014an example discussed\nby Aristotle\u2014is complete, in the sense of being assertible as it\nis, and is true at certain times, false at others. Prior was more\nfamiliar with the view (still widespread today) that such an expression\nis incomplete until a time-reference is supplied, and hence\nthat\u2014despite the seeming naturalness of doing so\u2014one cannot\nregard the expression as changing its truth-value with the passage of\ntime. The ancient view, that this change in value can and does occur,\nwas a crucial discovery for Prior. He wrote about it in The\nCraft, contrasting it with the modern view that \u2018Socrates is\nsitting down\u2019 is not a \u2018complete proposition\u2019 but\nrather a \u2018movable part\u2019 that occurs in many different\ncomplete propositions: \u2018\u201cSocrates is sitting down\u201d is\nthought of, we might say, as a diary entry, with a date, hour, minute\nand second beside it, and this date, etc. is part of the\n\u201cproposition\u201d\u2019 (1951: 98). (For more about\nPrior\u2019s discussion of temporality in The Craft see\nMarkoska-Cubrinovska 2017.)\n\n\nThis idea that tensed propositions are liable to be true at one time\nand false at another became central to Prior\u2019s philosophy. In a\nsummary of his views, composed nearly two decades later, he wrote:\n\n\n\nCertainly there are unchanging truths, but there are changing truths\nalso, and it is a pity if logic ignores these, and leaves it \u2026\nto comparatively informal \u2018dialecticians\u2019 to study the more\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 aspects of reality. (Prior 1996a: 46)\n\n1.1.1 Tense, indeterminism and freewill\n\n\nGeach\u2019s review sent Prior back to the ancient sources, and he\nfound Aristotle saying that some propositions about the future, namely\npropositions concerning events that are not determined at the time of\nutterance, are neither true nor false when they are uttered, since\nthere is, at that time, as yet no definite fact with which they accord\nor conflict. Prior quoted Aristotle\u2019s argument (in ch. 9 of\nDe Interpretatione) for believing in such events: if the\nfuture were determined, \u2018there would be no need to deliberate or\ntake trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain\ncourse, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result\nwould not follow\u2019 (Prior 1953: 322\u2013323).\n\n\nFor many years Prior had been a Barthian Calvinist, and, as Prior\nput it, the theologian Karl Barth \u2018attacked freewill in the name\nof religion\u2019 (Prior n.d.b: 1). In his mature work, however, Prior\nwas on the side of freewill and indeterminism. He developed profound\ntechnical analyses of the idea that the future is open, a branching\ntree of possibilities. The mature Prior said:\n\n\n\nOne of the big differences between the past and the future is that\nonce something has become past, it is, as it were, out of our\nreach\u2014once a thing has happened, nothing we can do can make it\nnot to have happened. But the future is to some extent, even though it\nis only to a very small extent, something we can make for ourselves.\nAnd this is a distinction which a tenseless logic is unable to express.\n(Prior 1996b: 48)\n\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that the origin of Prior\u2019s tense logic\nwas bound up with his change of mind about freewill. Landmark papers on\nhis path from determinism to indeterminism and the rejection of\nCalvinism were:\n\n\n\n\n(Prior n.d.a), in which a transitional soft determinism is\npropounded. This early typescript\u2014which cites William James on\nfreewill and determinism\u2014probably dates from around 1941.\nAccording to determinism, the \u2018causal chain\u2019 is\n\u2018all-embracing\u2019, Prior said, but even though we are\n\u2018part of the causal chain\u2019, we are not \u2018pure\neffect\u2019. The \u2018chain of causation\u2019 runs\n\u2018within\u2019 us \u2018as well as outside\u2019: we ourselves\nare causes. He continued: \u2018The only kind of universe in which\ngeneral freedom is conceivable is one which we might call\n\u201cloosely packed\u201d\u2019, and he emphasized that determinism\n\u2018is compatible with a relatively loose packing of the things in\nthe world\u2019. In a loosely packed universe, \u2018Causes and\neffects may not form a single chain; events may run in a number of\nchains which are partly independent of one another\u2019. He\nexplained:\n\n\n\nIn a box of powder which is ground infinitely small and packed\ninfinitely tightly, the slightest disturbance in one area will affect\nthe most distant grains. If, however, the grains are relatively large\nand packed relatively loosely, one can imagine, for example, a circular\nmotion of the grains in one area which does not affect even quite\nclosely adjacent grains at all \u2026 Common notions of freewill and\npartial responsibility seem to involve a picture of the world rather\nlike this\u2026. The common notion assumes a \u2018moderately\u2019\nloose packing in which there is elbow-room for a measure of free\naction, but in which we are sufficiently bound together by\n\u2018necessity\u2019 for us to have a measure of influence on one\nanother and responsibility for one another.\n\n\n\n(In another typescript from the same period (Prior n.d.b) he wrote\nthat \u2018our choices are pre-determined\u2019 but that \u2018it is\nin our power to find out what the forces are which determine our\nchoices, and even to exercise some control over them (while, of course,\nbeing in this very exercise \u201ccontrolled\u201d by other forces\nwhich do not worry us). Prior\u2019s (n.d.b) is discussed in detail in\nHasle (1999) and (2012).)\n\n\n\n\n(Prior 1947), in which he firmly distances himself from Barth.\n\n\n\n\n(Prior 1953), in which (following the Polish logician Jan\n\u0141ukasiewicz) he uses a 3-valued logic to formalize the\nAristotelian view that \u2018propositions about such future events as\nare not already predetermined\u2019 are neither true nor false (1953:\n322).\n\n\n\n\n(Prior 1955b), his first publication on tense logic.\n\n\n1.1.2 The first tense logic\n\n\nPrior wished to formalise the ancient insight that propositions can\nchange in truth value with the passage of time. He soon realised that\noff-the-shelf modal syntax could be adapted to do this. It was simply a\nmatter of taking seriously the idea he had discussed in The Craft\nof Formal Logic: tense is a species of modality, to be set\nalongside the ordinary (\u2018alethic\u2019) modes of necessity and\npossibility. When he discovered the \u2018Master\nArgument\u2019 of Megarian logician Diodorus Chronos (in Benson\nMates\u2019 1953 book Stoic Logic), Prior\u2019s exegesis of\nDiodorus\u2019s argument became the backdrop to his first publication\non tense logic, \u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019 (1955b).\n\n\nDiodorus defined the possible as what is or will be true: according\nto Diodorus, what actually happens is all that can happen.\nDiodorus, Prior later said, \u2018seems to have been an ancient Greek\nW.V. Quine, who regarded the Aristotelian logic of possibility and\nnecessity with some scepticism, but offered nevertheless some\n\u201charmless\u201d senses that might be attached to modal\nwords\u2019 (1967a: 16). Prior found this deterministic definition of\nthe possible uncongenial and set about locating a fallacy in the\nargument that Diodorus had used to support it, the so-called Master\nArgument:\n\n\n\nThe aim of the Master Argument, as I conceive it, was to refute the\nAristotelian view that while it is now beyond the power of men or gods\nto affect the past, there are alternative futures between which choice\nis possible. Against this, Diodorus held that the possible is simply\nwhat either is or will be true. (Prior 1962a: 138; see also 1967a:\n33.)\n\n\n\nConsideration of the Master Argument brought together three of\nPrior\u2019s great interests: indeterminism, modal logic, and the\nlogic of time. In the course of his reflections on the argument,\nFindlay\u2019s footnote pushed its way to the front of his mind. His\nwife Mary remembered \u2018his waking me one night, coming and sitting\non my bed, and reading a footnote from John Findlay\u2019s article on\ntime, and saying he thought one could make a formalised tense\nlogic\u2019 (Kenny 1970: 336).\n\n\n\u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019, completed by early 1954, set out\nPrior\u2019s initial exploration of his calculus of tenses. On the\nfirst page he wrote:\n\n\n\nI here propose to do something a little different, namely to employ\nthe ordinary propositional variables \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(q\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(r\\)\u2019 etc., for\n\u2018propositions\u2019 in the Diodoran sense [i.e. propositions\nwhich \u2018may be true at one time and false at another\u2019] and\nto use certain operators which take such propositions as arguments, and\nwhich form functions taking such propositions as values. I shall use\n\u2018\\(Fp\\)\u2019 for \u2018It will be the case that\n\\(p\\)\u2019. (1955b: 205.)\n\n\n\nThe calculus of tenses presented in \u2018Diodoran\nModalities\u2019 is the system produced by adding the following\naxioms, rules, and definition, to the ordinary propositional calculus.\n\\((1)\\ F(p \\vee q) \\equiv(Fp) \\vee \n(Fq)\\). \\((2)\\ FFp \\rightarrow Fp\\). (3)\u00a0If \\(p \\equiv q\\) is provable in the calculus (or is an axiom) then\n\\(Fp \\equiv Fq\\) follows. (4) If \\(p\\) is provable\nin the calculus (or is an axiom) then \\(Gp\\) follows; where\n\\(Gp\\), the future perpetual form \u2018It will always be the\ncase that \\(p\\)\u2019, is defined as\n\\(\\neg F\\neg p\\).\n1.1.3 Prior\u2019s 1954 Wellington Address\n\n\nThere was clearly more work to be done on this calculus\u2014for\none thing there was no mention of the past\u2014and Prior duly set\nabout extending his creation. He worked fast, and in August 1954\nunveiled a system of far greater sophistication, in his Presidential\nAddress to the second New Zealand Congress of Philosophy, held in\nWellington.\n\n\nPrior\u2019s expanded calculus contained two additional axioms\nconcerning futurity, \\(Gp \\rightarrow Fp\\) and \\(Fp \\rightarrow FFp.\\)\nThere was also a simplification: instead of following his previous\npractice and defining \\(G\\) as \\(\\neg F\\neg\\), Prior took \\(G\\) as\nundefined and defined \\(F\\) as \\(\\neg G\\neg\\); this enabled him to\nreplace the somewhat unwieldy axiom (1) by the more elegant \\(G(p\n\\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow(Gp \\rightarrow Gq)\\). Moreover, he\ntransformed this calculus of \u2018pure futurity\u2019 into a\ncalculus of \u2018pure pastness\u2019 by replacing \\(F\\) throughout\nthe axioms, rules, and definition, by the past tense operator \\(P\\)\n(\u2018It has been the case that\u2019), and replacing \\(G\\) by the\npast perpetual operator \\(H\\) (\u2018It has always been the case\nthat\u2019).\n\n\nLike ordinary modal logic, both these \u2018pure\u2019 calculi are\nmonomodal; that is, each contains only one undefined modal\noperator. Prior wanted a \u2018full tense calculus\u2019, containing\nthe two undefined operators \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), together with\nthe operators \\(F\\) and \\(P\\) defined in terms of them (such\na calculus is known as a \\(bi\\)modal logic). To obtain the full\ncalculus it was not enough simply to bundle together the two\n\u2018pure\u2019 systems, because the two tense operators would\nremain independent of one another. Some interactive axioms,\n\u2018laws which relate to the interaction of pastness and\nfuturity\u2019, were also required. Prior chose \\(p \\rightarrow\\)\n\\(GPp\\) and \\(p \\rightarrow HFp.\\)\n\n\nWhat are the justifications for his axioms and rules? In\n\u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019, Prior was content to describe\n\\(FFp \\rightarrow Fp\\) as \u2018obvious enough\u2019, but by\nthe time of the Wellington Congress his thinking had moved forward\nconsiderably. He there set out what he called the\n\u2018\\(l\\)-calculus\u2019 (he was later to prefer the term\n\u2018\\(U\\)-calculus\u2019). \u2018\\(l\\)\u2019 is the\nrelation \u2018is later than\u2019 (relating dates). In the\n\\(l\\)-calculus, the propositions of the tense calculus are treated\nas expressing properties of dates. \u2018lxz &\n\\(px\\)\u2019 (where \\(p\\) might be \u2018Socrates is\nsitting down\u2019, for example) is read \u2018\\(x\\) is later\nthan \\(z\\) and \\(p\\) at \\(x\\)\u2019 \\((x\\) and\n\\(z\\) are dates). Using the (arbitrary) date \\(z\\) to\nrepresent the time of utterance, \\(Fp\\) is equated with\n\\(\\exists x(lxz \\amp px)\\) (\u2018\\(p\\) at\nsome time later than \\(z\\)\u2019), and \\(Pp\\) with\n\\(\\exists x(lzx \\amp px)\\) (\u2018\\(p\\) at\nsome time earlier than \\(z\\)\u2019). \\(Gp\\) and \\(Hp\\)\nare equated with the universal quantifications\n\\(\\forall x(lxz \\rightarrow px)\\) and\n\\(\\forall x(lzx \\rightarrow px)\\) respectively. (Much\nlater, Prior recast the date-terms of his \\(U\\)-calculi as\n\u2018instant propositions\u2019\u2014propositions true at one and\nonly one instant\u2014so introducing what is now called \n hybrid logic.)\n\n\nPrior showed that if various assumptions are made concerning the\nrelation \\(l\\), the axioms of the tense calculus can be proved in the\n\\(l\\)-calculus. (Two years later, he and Meredith used essentially the\nsame strategy in creating the possible worlds semantics for ordinary\nmodal logic.) He discovered that \\(FFp \\rightarrow Fp\\) and its image\n\\(PPp\\rightarrow Pp\\) follow from the assumption \\(lxy \\rightarrow\n(lyz \\rightarrow lxz),\\) stating that the relation \\(l\\) is\ntransitive. \\(Fp \\rightarrow FFp\\) and its image \\(Pp \\rightarrow\nPPp\\) follow given the assumption lxz \\(\\rightarrow \\exists\ny(lxy \\amp lyz),\\) stating that \u2018between any two dates there is\nanother date\u2019 (a condition sometimes said to express\ntime\u2019s density). \\(Gp \\rightarrow Fp\\) follows given\n\\(\\exists xlxz,\\) stating that \u2018there is a date later than any\ngiven date\u2019, i.e., that there is no last moment of time.  \\(Hp\n\\rightarrow Pp\\) requires \\(\\exists xlzx,\\) stating that there is no\nfirst moment of time.\n\n\nPrior showed, furthermore, that no assumptions at all are needed for\nthe derivation of the two interactive axioms \\(p \\rightarrow GPp\\) and\n\\(p \\rightarrow HFp,\\) nor for the axioms \\(G(p \\rightarrow q)\n\\rightarrow(Gp \\rightarrow Gq)\\) and \\(H(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow\n(Hp \\rightarrow Hq)\\). In the case of these formulae, the ordinary\nmachinery of truth-functional and quantifier logic suffices for their\nproof. The same is true, he showed, of the four rules of the tense\ncalculus ((3) and (4) above, together with the \\(P\\) form of (3) and\nthe \\(H\\) form of (4)). This part, therefore, of Prior\u2019s\ncalculus of tenses is purely logical, whereas others of the\naxioms\u2014those stating that \\(l\\) is transitive, that time is\ndense, and that there is no first or last moment of\ntime\u2014express physical properties of time. In later\nwork, Prior considered further calculi, in which these particular\n\u2018physical\u2019 axioms are replaced by others, for example\naxioms stating that time has a first moment, or is linear (a\n\u2018straight line\u2019), or is non-linear, with the present\nalways standing at the junction of a number of branches, any of which\nmight become the actual future.\n\n\nWhich is metaphysically basic, the tense calculus or the\n\\(l\\)-calculus? Prior issued a warning against regarding the above\ninterpretation of the tense calculus within the \\(l\\)-calculus as\n\u2018a metaphysical explanation of what we mean by is, has been and\nwill be\u2019: the \\(l\\)-calculus, he said, is not\n\u2018metaphysically fundamental\u2019. His reason is that\n\u2018\\(F\\)(Socrates is sitting down)\u2019 means \u2018It is\nnow the case that it will be the case that Socrates is sitting\ndown\u2019, whereas there is no genuine way of representing the\nindexical \u2018now\u2019 in the \\(l\\)-calculus (the date\nvariable \\(z\\) is not an indexical, any more than \u201821\nJanuary 1954\u2019 is an indexical). Prior continued: \u2018If there\nis to be any \u201cinterpretation\u201d of our calculi in the\nmetaphysical sense, it will probably need to be the other way round;\nthat is, the \\(l\\)-calculus should be exhibited as a logical\nconstruction out of the \\(PF\\)-calculus rather than vice\nversa.\u2019 This idea of the primacy of the tense calculus over\nthe \\(l\\)-calculus (or, as he later put it, of McTaggart\u2019s\n\\(A\\)-series over the \\(B\\)-series) became a central and\ndistinctive tenet of his philosophy. Prior took a similar metaphysical\nposition with respect to ordinary modal logic, arguing that the\nlanguage of possible worlds is to be interpreted in terms of a language\nwith modal operators and not, as is popularly held, vice\nversa. These issues form the theme of his final book Worlds,\nTimes and Selves. (For more about the world\u2013time parallel, see Rini and Cresswell 2012.)\n1.1.4 The Master Argument and three-valued logic\n\n\nIn a matchless piece of philosophical reconstruction\u2014in\n\u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019\u2014Prior expresses the conclusion\nof the Master Argument, that what neither is nor will be true is not\npossible, as \\((\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp) \\rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond p\\),\nand derives this in his calculus from Diodorus\u2019 premisses, \\(Pp\n\\rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond \\neg Pp\\) and \\(\\neg\\Diamond q \\rightarrow\n(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow \\neg\\Diamond p),\\) together with\ntwo \u2018broad assumptions about time, likely to have been taken for\ngranted both by Diodorus and by his main opponents\u2019, viz. \\(p\n\\rightarrow HFp\\) and \\((\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp)\n\\rightarrow P\\neg Fp.\\)\n\n\nSo the Master Argument is indeed valid. The fallacy, Prior tells us,\nlies with the second \u2018broad assumption\u2019 \\((\\neg p \\amp\n\\neg Fp) \\rightarrow P\\neg Fp\\) (which says: when anything\nneither is nor will be the case, it has been the case that it will not\nbe the case). This, Prior tells us, is not true if \\(p\\) refers to a\nfuture contingency, and thus has the truth value \u00bd or\n\u2018indeterminate\u2019. Where \\(p\\) is indeterminate, both \\(Fp\\)\nand \\(\\neg Fp\\) are indeterminate, so the consequent of the disputed\nformula, \\(P \\neg Fp\\), is false. \\(\\neg p\\) must also be\nindeterminate (for if the negation of \\(p\\) were determinate, \\(p\\)\ncould not be indeterminate). Thus the antecedent of the \u2018broad\nassumption\u2019, \\(\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp\\), is indeterminate, since\nboth its conjuncts are indeterminate.\n\n\nThe next step of Prior\u2019s argument was to appeal to\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s 3-valued truth-table for \\(\\rightarrow\\). According to\nthe table, an indicative conditional with a false consequent and an\nindeterminate antecedent is not true but indeterminate:\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0\n\n\n\u00bd\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nThus Prior was able to \u2018deny that propositions of the form [\\((\n\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp) \\rightarrow\\) P\\(\\neg\\)Fp] are in all cases\ntrue\u2019, so faulting the Master Argument.\n\n\nThe Master Argument for determinism continued to exercise Prior for\nthe rest of his life, and some of the most useful and mathematically\nmost interesting parts of his work were inspired by his thoughts on it.\nTo pick just one example, from computer science, tense calculi that\nPrior developed\u2014leading on from the idea that the Master Argument\nis defeated if time is conceived as branching into the\nfuture\u2014have become useful for describing and verifying the\nbehaviour of distributed and concurrent processing systems (see e.g.\nBen-Ari, Pnueli, and Manna 1983).\n",
