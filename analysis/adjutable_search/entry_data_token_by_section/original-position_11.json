    "main_text": "The Arguments for the Principles of Justice from the Original Position || The Strains of Commitment\n6.3 The Strains of Commitment\n\nThere are three additional arguments Rawls makes to support justice as\nfairness (all in TJ, sect. 29). Each of these depends upon the concept\nof a \u201cwell-ordered society.\u201d The parties in the original\nposition are to choose principles that are to govern a well-ordered\nsociety where everyone agrees, complies with, and wants to comply with\nits principles of justice. The ideal of a well-ordered\nsociety is Rawls\u2019s development of social contract doctrine.\nIt is a society in which (1) everyone knows and willingly accepts and\naffirms the same public principles of justice and everyone knows this;\n(2) these principles are successfully realized in basic social\ninstitutions, including laws and conventions, and are generally\ncomplied with by citizens; and (3) reasonable persons are morally\nmotivated to comply by their sense of justice \u2013 they want to do\nwhat justice requires of them (TJ 4\u20135, \u00a769). There are then\ntwo sides to Rawls\u2019s social contract. The parties in the\noriginal position have the task of agreeing to principles that all can\nrationally accept behind the veil of ignorance under the conditions of\nthe original position. But their rational choice is partially\ndetermined by the principles that free and equal moral persons in a\nwell ordered society who are motivated by their sense of justice\nreasonably can accept, agree to.and comply with, as the basic\nprinciples governing their social and political relations.\n\nThe parties are to assess principles according to the relative\nstability of the well ordered societies into which they are\nincorporated. Thus a well-ordered society of justice as fairness is to\nbe compared with a well-ordered society whose basic structure is\norganized according to the average utility principle, aggregate\nutility, perfectionism, intuitionism, libertarianism, and so on. They\nare to consider which of these societies\u2019 basic struture is\nrelatively more stable and likely to endure over time from one\ngeneration to the next, given natural and socially influenced\npsychological propensities and conditions of social cooperation as\nthey interact with alternative principles of justice.\n\nNow to return to Rawls\u2019s arguments for his principles of\njustice. The first of Rawls\u2019s three arguments highlights the\nidea that choice in the original position is an agreement,\nand involves certain \u201cstrains of commitment.\u201d It\nis assumed by all the parties that all will comply with the principles\nthey agree to once the veil is lifted and they are members of a\nwell-ordered society (TJ 176f./153f. and CP 250ff). Knowing that they\nwill be held to their commitment and expected to comply with\nprinciples for a well-ordered society, the parties must choose\nprinciples that they sincerely believe they will be able to accept,\nendorse and willingly observe under conditions where these principles\nare generally accepted and enforced. For reasons to be discussed\nshortly, Rawls says this condition favors agreement on the principles\nof justice over utilitarianism and other alternatives.\n\nBut first, consider the frequent objection that there is no genuine\nagreement in the original position, for the thick veil of ignorance\ndeprives the parties of all bases for bargaining (cf. TJ,\n139\u201340/120\u201321 rev.). In the absence of bargaining, it is\nsaid, there can be no contract. For contracts must involve a quid\npro quo\u2014something given for something received (called\n\u2018consideration\u2019 at common law). The parties in the OP\ncannot bargain without knowing what they have to offer or to gain in\nexchange. So (the objection continues) Rawls\u2019s original position\ndoes not involve a real social contract, unlike those that transpire,\nsay, in a state of nature. Rather, since the parties are all\n\u201cdescribed in the same way,\u201d there is no need for multiple\nparties but simply the rational choice of one person in the original\nposition (see Hampton, 1980, 334; see also Gauthier, 1974 and 1985,\n203).\n\nIn response, not all contracts involve bargaining or are of the nature\nof economic transactions. Some involve a mutual pledge and commitment\nto shared purposes and principles. Marriage contracts, or agreements\namong friends or the members of a religious, benevolent, or political\nassociation are often of this nature. For example, the Mayflower\nCompact was a \u201ccovenant\u201d to \u201ccombine ourselves\ntogether into a civil body politic\u201d charged with making and\nadministering \u201cjust and equal laws\u2026for the general\ngood.\u201d Likewise the U.S. Constitution represents itself as a\ncommitment wherein \u201cWe The People \u2026 ordain and establish\nthis Constitution\u201d in order \u201cto establish justice,\u201d\n\u201cpromote the general welfare,\u201d \u201csecure the blessings\nof liberty,\u201d and so on. The agreement in Rawls\u2019s original\nposition is more of this nature. Even though ignorant of particular\nfacts about themselves, the parties in fact do give something in\nexchange for something received: they all exchange their mutual\ncommitment to accept and abide by the principles of justice and to\nuphold just institutions once they enter their well-ordered society.\nEach agrees only on condition others do too, and all tie themselves\ninto social and political relations in perpetuity. Their agreement is\nfinal, and they will not permit its renegotiation should circumstances\nturn out to be different than some had hoped for. Their mutual\ncommitment to justice is reflected by the fact that once these\nprinciples become embodied in institutions there are no legitimate\nmeans that permit anyone to depart from the terms of their agreement.\nAs a result, the parties have to take seriously the moral and legal\nobligations and potential social sanctions they will incur as a result\nof their agreement, for there is no going back to the initial\nsituation. So if they do not sincerely believe that they can accept\nthe requirements of a conception of justice and voluntarily conform\ntheir actions and life plans accordingly, then these are strong\nreasons to avoid choosing those principles. It would not be rational\nfor the parties to take risks, falsely assuming that if they end up\nbadly, they can violate at will the terms of agreement or later regain\ntheir initial situation and renegotiate terms of cooperation (see\nFreeman, 1990; Freeman, 2007b, 180\u2013182).\n\nRawls gives special poignancy to this mutual commitment of the parties\nby making it a condition that the parties cannot choose and agree to\nprinciples in bad faith; they have to be able, not simply to live with\nand grudgingly accept, but instead to willingly endorse the principles\nof justice as members of society. Essential to Rawls\u2019s argument\nfor stability is the assumption of everyone\u2019s willing\ncompliance with requirements of justice. This is a feature of a\nwell-ordered society. The parties are assumed to have a sense of\njustice; indeed the development and exercise of it is one of their\nfundamental interests. Hence they must choose principles that that\nthey can not only accept and live with, but which are responsive to\ntheir sense of justice and they can unreservedly endorse. Given these\nconditions on choice, the parties cannot take risks with principles\nthey know they will have difficulty complying with voluntarily. They\nwould be making an agreement in bad faith, and this is ruled out by\nthe conditions of the original position.\n\nRawls contends that these \u201cstrains of commitment\u201d created\nby the parties\u2019 agreement strongly favor the principles of\njustice over the principles of utility and other teleological (and\nmost consequentialist) views. For everyone\u2019s freedom, basic\nrights and liberties, and basic needs are met by the principles of\njustice because of their egalitarian nature. Given the lack of these\nguarantees under the principle of utility, it is much more difficult\nfor those who end up worse off in a utilitarian society to willingly\naccept their situation and commit themselves to the utility principle.\nIt is a rare person indeed who can freely and without resentment\nsacrifice their life prospects so that those who are better off can\nhave even greater comforts, privileges, and powers. This is too much\nto demand of our capacities for human benevolence. It requires a kind\nof commitment that people cannot make in good faith, for who could\nwillingly support laws that are so detrimental to oneself and the\npeople one cares about most that they must sacrifice their fundamental\ninterests for the sake of those more advantaged? Besides, why should\nwe encourage such subservient dispositions and the accompanying lack\nof self-respect? The principles of justice, by contrast, conform\nbetter with everyone\u2019s interests, their desire for self-respect\nand their natural moral capacities to reciprocally recognize and\nrespect others\u2019 legitimate interests while freely promoting\ntheir own good. The strains of commitment incurred by agreement in the\noriginal position provide strong reasons for the parties to choose the\nprinciples of justice and reject the risks involved in choosing the\nprinciples of average or aggregate utility.\n",
