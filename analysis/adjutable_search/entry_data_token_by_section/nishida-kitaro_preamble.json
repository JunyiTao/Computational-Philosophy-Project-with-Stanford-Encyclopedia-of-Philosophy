    "main_text": "\n\n\nNishida Kitar\u014d was the most significant and influential Japanese\nphilosopher of the twentieth-century. His work is pathbreaking in\nseveral respects: it established in Japan the creative discipline of\nphilosophy as practiced in Europe and the Americas; it enriched that\ndiscipline by infusing Anglo-European philosophy with Asian sources of\nthought; it provided a new basis for philosophical treatments of East\nAsian Buddhist thought; and it produced novel theories of self and\nworld with rich implications for contemporary\nphilosophizing. Nishida\u2019s work is also frustrating for its repetitive\nand often obscure style, exceedingly abstract formulations, and\ndetailed but frequently dead-end investigations.  Nishida once said of\nhis work, \u201cI have always been a miner of ore; I have never\nmanaged to refine it\u201d (Nishida 1958, Preface). A concise\npresentation of his achievements therefore will require extensive\nselection, interpretation and clarification.\n\n\nThis article presents Nishida\u2019s work in a roughly chronological order. We\nmay understand his philosophical project overall as an attempt to\nrestore to experience and consciousness the rigor, necessity and\nuniversality accorded to logic. This project developed in a direction\nquite opposite to that of psychologism, which would reduce logic to\nthe contingencies of the individual mind or brain. It also differed\nfrom efforts to establish pure logic as a self-explanatory realm, in\nthat Nishida insisted on the starting point of experience, a priority\nhe shared with Husserl\u2019s phenomenology and William James\u2019 radical\nempiricism. We might characterize his philosophy in general as a\nphenomenological metaphysics for its universalizing of first-person\nexperience. It can also be considered an ontology of logical forms for\nits investigations of their experiential basis, with one\nqualification: although Nishida proposed a unitary source of such\nforms, that source is neither exclusionary nor positive; in other\nwords the source itself cannot be described monistically as a single,\nmore basic form or thing.  Nishida eventually called this source\n\u201cmu\u201d (nothingness), a notion he found particularly prominent in Asian traditions.  His interests led him to develop a\nphilosophy of culture, and his status as Japan\u2019s premier philosopher led government officials to call upon him for justification of\nJapanese expansionism in the late 1930s and early 40s. His last work\nrecapitulated his non-dualistic account of world and self, but also\nreinterpreted the meaning of death.\n",
