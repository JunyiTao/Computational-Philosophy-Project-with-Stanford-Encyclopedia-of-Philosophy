    "main_text": "Freedom and Agency\n8. Freedom and Agency\n\nLeibniz believed that every phenomenon could be explained. His\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason states that \u201cnothing takes place\nwithout a sufficient reason; in other words,\u2026nothing occurs for\nwhich it would be impossible for someone who has enough knowledge of\nthings to give a reason adequate to determine why the thing is as it\nis and not otherwise.\u201d Though not everything possible happens\n(and, therefore not everything that happens is necessary), everything\nthat happens has a sufficient reason in an antecedent state of the\nworld. God\u2019s necessary existence is the only state of affairs\nthat is caused and does not have a sufficient reason in an antecedent\nstate. Not only does everything have a sufficient reason, but all\nphenomena and events, including celestial motions, the formation of\nplant and animal bodies, and the processes of life, are regulated by\nthe laws of mechanics, as the movements of the hands are regulated in\na watch (G 7:417\u20138).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Principle was incompatible with the existence of an\nopen future and with free will. His followers recognized this aspect\nof his system, though his Discourse on Metaphysics, in which\ndeterminism is tied to his inclusion theory of predicate-subject\nrelations remained unpublished until the twentieth century. Though\nLeibniz tried to avoid contradicting the theological dogma of free\nwill outright, he denied that any creature could choose between\nalternatives to which it was indifferent, and he agreed with Locke\nthat we are powerfully and necessarily motivated by disquiet and\nrestlessness, which are, in Leibniz\u2019s view, sometimes\nunconscious or subliminal (A 188f). My body is a machine in a wider\nmechanical system, and my thoughts and desires, including my\n\u201cpetites perceptions,\u201d cannot but harmonize with or\nparallel states of that machine. \u201cThe organized mass in which\nthe point of view of the soul is located, being expressed more\nimmediately by it, [is] reciprocally ready to act on her account\nfollowing the laws of the corporeal machine, at the moment when the\nsoul wills it, without one disturbing the laws of other, the animal\nspirits and blood taking on, exactly the motions required to\ncorrespond to the passions and the perceptions of the soul\u201d (G\n4: 484). Yet, for Leibniz, the infinite complexity and uniqueness of\nany living machine make human actions unpredictable, and the truth of\ndeterminism is consistent with our experiences of self-control,\nself-management, and behavioural reform (A 195f). For a variety of\nreasons, Leibniz did not see determinism or mechanism as a threat to\nmorality.\n\nKant did. His perception was facilitated by a series of attacks on\nLeibniz\u2019s disciple Christian Wolff by theologians alarmed by\nwhat they saw as the horrific consequences of Sufficient Reason,\nattacks that led to Wolff\u2019s banishment from the University at\nHalle. Leibniz\u2019s \u201cspiritual automaton,\u201d moved by its\npresentations, has a freedom, Kant claims in his second critique, the\nCritique of Practical Reason, that is only\n\u201cpsychological and comparative.\u201d If Leibniz is right, we\nhave no more than a \u201cfreedom of the turnspit\u201d (5: 97),\nwound up to run by itself. In that case, Kant thought, man is a\n\u201cmarionette\u201d (5:101), and morality is but a figment of the\nimagination. To know that the moral law is not a figment and is\ngenuinely binding, it might seem that we would have to know that we\nhave the power to redirect the forces of nature. Of course we cannot\nknow this, but, on the other hand, we cannot prove that no such power\nexists. [See the entry on\n Kant\n (Sect 5.2) and the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\n (Sect. 10).]\n\nReason presents compelling arguments for the inevitable nature of\nevery event. Reason also presents compelling arguments that the human\nwill can influence the course of nature (KRV A 445/B 473). The\nantinomy is dissolved, Kant now maintains, by recognizing that causal\nrelations must structure outward phenomena. Our investigations of\nnature presuppose that they do, insofar as they are scientific. Human\nagency is not, however, an outward phenomenon, and the assumption of\ndeterminism is not required. We can view ourselves as machines,\nresponding to the environment in predetermined ways. However, we are\nnot compelled to do so, and we are able to regard ourselves as agents\nwho initiate trains of events, and who can resist (not just experience\nresistance to) the desires, sensations, and impulses driving the\nbodily machine to certain actions. Since we can do so, Kant decides,\nwe should: we need not in that case be driven to or fall into\nlibertinage on the basis of speculative doctrine. What reason cannot\nsettle theoretically, she can nevertheless decide on\n\u201cpractical\u201d grounds, i.e., deciding to believe one thing\nrather than another to preserve satisfaction (by contrast with anxiety\nand despair), and to give support to our sense that morality is not a\nfigment. We ought therefore to conceptualize our possession of free\nwill as an exemption from the laws of nature; the power of\n\u201cdoing and forbearing.\u201d (5: 95).\n",
