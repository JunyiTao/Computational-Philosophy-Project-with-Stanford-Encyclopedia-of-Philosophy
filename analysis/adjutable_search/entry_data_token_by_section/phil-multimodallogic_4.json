In\n epistemology,\n researchers are searching for the correct characterization of\nknowledge, and a common trend has been to view knowledge as a form of\n justified true belief\n (an idea that can be traced back to Plato\u2019s dialogue\nTheaetetus). Gettier\u2019s\n famous counterexamples\n showed that such a simple characterization of knowledge is not\nsufficient: a further condition is required, such as safety,\nsensitivity, robustness or stability. In spite of this, a\ncharacterization of knowledge as justified true belief is an important\nfirst step. Classic\n epistemic logic\n does not explicitly deal with the notion of\n justification,[2]\n so a starting point is a simpler understanding of knowledge as true\nbelief.\n\nTake a doxastic relational model with its relation \\(R_B\\)\nbeing serial, transitive and Euclidean (a KD45 setting), and\nuse a modality B semantically interpreted with respect to\n\\(R_B\\) in the standard way. In this setting, two options arise. The\nfirst one is syntactic, as in the examples that have been\ndiscussed so far, and consists in defining a modality for knowledge as\n\u2018true belief\u2019: \\(K'\\varphi := B\\varphi \\land \\varphi\\).\nThe second is semantic, and consists in defining an epistemic\nequivalence relation \\(R_K\\) as the reflexive and symmetric closure of\nthe doxastic relation, then using it in the standard way to give the\nsemantic interpretation of a modality K.\n\nIt should be noted that the two approaches are not equivalent.\nConsider the following doxastic model (from Halpern, Samet, &\nSegev 2009a), with the serial, transitive and Euclidean\ndoxastic relation \\(R_B\\) represented by dashed arrows, and\nits derived reflexive, transitive and symmetric (i.e., equivalence)\nepistemic relation \\(R_K\\) represented by solid ones.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nNote how the agent believes p on every world in the model,\n\\(\\llbracket \\oB{}p \\rrbracket^{M} = \\left\\{ {w_1, w_2, w_3}\n\\right\\}\\); then, as the syntactic approach states that\n\\({K'\\varphi}\\) holds in those worlds in which \\(B\\varphi \\land\n\\varphi\\) is the case, we have \n\\[\\llbracket K'p \\rrbracket^{M} = \\llbracket {\\oB{}p} \\land p \\rrbracket^{M} = \\left\\{ {w_1, w_2} \\right\\}.\\]\n\n\nHowever, according to the semantic approach, \\(K\\varphi\\) holds in\nthose worlds from which all epistemically accessible situations\nsatisfy \\(\\varphi\\), so \\(\\llbracket K p \\rrbracket^{M} = \\left\\{ w_1\n\\right\\}\\). Thus, \\({K'}\\) and K are not equivalent. One of the\nreasons for this mismatch is that the two options do not enforce the\nsame properties on the derived notion of knowledge. For example, while\nthe semantic approach enforces negative introspection (by making\n\\(R_K\\) an equivalence relation), the syntactic one does not. In fact,\nthis property fails at \\(w_3\\), as \\(\\lnot {K'p}\\) is true \\(({B p}\n\\land p\\) fails, as p fails) but still \\(K'\\lnot{K'p}\\)\n(unfolded as \\({B (\\lnot {B p} \\lor \\lnot p)} \\land (\\lnot B p \\lor\n\\lnot p))\\) is\n false.[3]\n\nSection 4.1\n comes back on the relationship between these two concepts, recalling\nalternative multi-modal accounts that relate knowledge and belief\nwhile doing justice to the involved epistemological subtleties.\n",
