    "main_text": "Continuum\n11. Continuum\n\nIn Physics V.3, 226b18, Aristotle begins to talk about the\nnotions of \u2018together\u2019, \u2018apart\u2019, \u2018in\ntouch\u2019, \u2018between\u2019, \u2018next in succession\u2019,\n\u2018contiguous\u2019 and \u2018continuous\u2019.\nPhysics 226b23\u201327 is a sentence out of place and\nIs\u1e25\u0101q translation does not contain it. His translation goes\non:\n\n\nWhat moves continuously is that which has no gap at all, or a minimal,\nin that thing (pragma: ma\u02bbn\u00e0) in which\nits motion happens, nor [a gap] in time. A gap [in time] does not\nprevent the [highest] musical note Z\u012br (neat\u0113) from\ncoming after the [lowest] musical note Bam (hypat\u0113) in\nplace. I mean only the thing in which motion happens, and this is\nevident in movements that happen in place as well as in all others.\n(\u1e6cab\u012b\u02bba [1964: 540\u2013541]; cf.\nPhys. V.3, 226b27\u201332)\n\n\nBessarion almost skipped the musical example, but Scotus had\ntranslated Is\u1e25\u0101q\u2019s text together with Averroes\u2019\ncommentary (LC 223 HI T23). Aristotle admits minimal breaks in his\ndefinition of continuum, and his musical instance refers to the\npossibility of omitting a few notes, and that nevertheless, the\ntransition to be continuous (Ross 1936: 628).\n\nThis definition of continuum looks contradictory in itself, but\nAverroes remains faithful to Aristotle and widens the range of\npossible breaks in a continuous change and motion. Many movements are\ncontinuous although they have small breaks in the thing\n(ma\u02bbn\u00e0: intentio) like animals when they\nwalk, \u201cbut those that fly or swim do not have a break at\nall\u201d (LC 223L T23).\n\nAverroes explicitly backs Alexander\u2019s account that Book VI\nfollows Book V because the beginning of the former makes use of the\n\u201cdescriptions\u201d of the continuous, contiguous and next in\nsuccession objects that were set up in Book V (LC 246L T1). Aristotle\nstrives to prove that a continuum cannot be composed of indivisibles,\nand he gives the example of the line, because a line cannot be\ncomposed of points. The cause for the continuum in magnitude, spatial\nextension (megethos) is pleaded with various arguments, and\nit is shown that time and motion are continuous too (Phys.\nVI.1, 231a21\u2013233b32). They are always divisible.\n\nThe same seems to apply for the subject of change: \u201cAnything\nthat changes must be divisible\u201d (Phys. VI.4, 234b10),\nbut Averroes has read the commentators and knows their doubts (LC 265I\nT32). First, does Aristotle mean only motion in the three categories,\nquantity, quality, and place, or does he also mean change in\nsubstance? Second, if there are changes in no time, how can the\nmovable be partially there where it starts and there where it\nends?\n\nAlexander denied the existence of changes in no time, but \u201call\nthe Peripatetics admit changes that take place in no time, as this is\nevident in lights and similar actions\u201d (LC 265L). Themistius\nbelieved that Aristotle did not intend here any change in no time.\nAvempace claimed that the divisibility that Aristotle means here is\nnot the divisibility according to the last point, secundum\nultima, but according to the circumstance that in the movable\nthere are two contraries, during the interval, and Averroes adds\n\u201cI sustained this view long time ago\u201d (LC 266C; cf. SC\n99:13\u2013100:2), and he had actually affirmed that Avempace had\nsolved the issue (MC Wolfson 544\u2013545; MC Kalonymos L 81v\u00ba\n& O 64v\u00ba).\n\nAverroes admits changes in no time but he restricts them to accidental\nchanges, and they are those which are the aim of another change and he\ngives the instance of lighting the room thanks to the motion of the\ncandle. Since they result from another change, they are divisible in\nso far as the main movables are (LC 266F). As Cerami remarks, this is\nhow Averroes wants to solve the aporia of the instantaneous changes\n(Cerami 2015: 406).\n\nFor the changes that Averroes calls \u201cessential\u201d, Aristotle\nstresses that during the process of change the movable must be partly\nunder one condition and partly under the other. He explains: when\nwhite changes into black, it is partially white and partially grey, as\ngrey is the first degree of change (Phys. VI.4,\n234b17\u201318).\n\nAverroes verifies the fact in changes in quality\u2014color,\ntemperature, place, and substance. In all we find a first changed\nthing that is partially in that from which it changed and partially in\nthat into which has primarily changed (LC 266I). Let us quote his\nwords describing substantial change:\n\n\nHowever the first [thing] in coming-to-be and passing-away is the\nminimal part of the generated [substance] being able to exist;\n\u201cminimum\u201d there is a [minimal] complete quantity in any\ngenerated [substance], for instance, the minimal part of fire is\ncomplete, i.e., the minimal part that is capable to be fire,\nminima pars, quae potest esse ignis. (LC 267D\nTC32)\n\n\nAbove we read that \u201canimals that walk\u201d have minimal breaks\nin their local motion and now we face an even more serious challenge\nto the continuum theory. It should be noted that Ruth Glasner has\nargued that Averroes in this passage develops a new doctrine of\nchange, namely, change as \u201ca contiguous chain of intermediate\nchanges\u201d (Glasner 2009: 122\u2013127). Moreover, she has shown\nthat Averroes\u2019 breakdown extends to the composition of the\nbodies that are generated and perish, so that actual minimal units\nexist, \u201cunits having mater, form, and specific natura\nmotion\u201d (Glasner 2009, 159). Glasner has adduced evidence to\nsupport Averroes\u2019 originality and the significance of his\ninnovative doctrine for the history of modern \nscience.[10]\n\nAverroes had to go back to the issue in his interpretation of Book\nVIII.3, 253b6\u201331, where Aristotle denies the processes of\nincrease and decrease and of qualitative change to be always\n occurring[11].\n His commentary is unusually long (LC 358D\u2013360F TC23) and\nAverroes asks himself why Aristotle had to refute something apparently\nobvious. He conjectures that the reason is because continuity is\nhidden in quantitative and qualitative motions (in motibus\naugmentationis et alterationis, LC 359H). He gives the\nAristotelian example of the stone being worn away by the drop of water\nand then discusses how the process takes place. The stone loses each\ntime a certain part, and not whatever part but the first actually\ncreated one (prima pars facta in actu, LC 359G), and the same\nrule applies to the falling drops of water. They are complete parts.\nAverroes recalls that Aristotle had said in Book VI (234b10\u201320)\nthat what changes does not have a first part, and he sees there a\ndifficulty but he explains:\n\n\nLet us say that the first part that is generated from the motion is in\nsome way in actuality and in some way in potentiality because it is\ndeterminate as that which will be in actuality, and under this aspect\nit is not divisible, and it is divisible in so far as motion is\ncontinuous.
