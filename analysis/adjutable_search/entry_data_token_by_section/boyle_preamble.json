    "main_text": "\n\nBoyle was one of the leading intellectual figures of the seventeenth\ncentury and an important influence on Locke and Newton (Anstey 2018).\nHe was an experimental philosopher, unwilling to construct abstract\ntheories to which his experimental results had to conform. \u201cOur\nBoyle,\u201d Oldenburg wrote to Spinoza, \u201cis one of those who\nare distrustful enough of their reasoning to wish that the phenomena\nshould agree with it\u201d (Hall & Hall 1965\u20131977, 2:38).\nBoyle, a champion of both the corpuscularian doctrine and the Baconian\nmethod of natural history, preferred to report the results of his\nexperiments, including negative results, and frequently lamented the\nfact that we lacked \u201chistories\u201d (collections of\nexperimental results and accurate observations) in various fields of\nscientific endeavour. He performed so many experiments that he was\nable, at one \u201ctime to loose \u2026 at once near five centuries\nof Experiments of my own\u201d (BP 9:28). Nor was this an isolated\nloss; nonetheless the number, variety and scope of his experiments\nwere such that he carried on working and publishing with no particular\ndifficulty. \u201cHis books,\u201d as Huygens remarked to Leibniz\nimmediately after Boyle\u2019s death, \u201care full of\nexperiments\u201d (Huygens 1888, 10:239). Moreover, experiments were\nexactly what he was interested in, he had a certain\nmissionary zeal in spreading the corpuscularian gospel, but he was not\nhimself interested in detailed system\n building,[1]\n a fact that was commonly noted. Leibniz told Huygens that he was\n\u201castonished\u201d that Boyle \u201cwho has so many fine\nexperiments, [had] not come to some theory of chemistry after\nmeditating so long on them. Yet in his books, and for all the\nconsequences that he draws from his observations, he concludes only\nwhat we all know, that everything happens mechanically. He is perhaps\ntoo reserved. Excellent men should leave us even their conjectures;\nthey are wrong if they wish to give us only those truths that are\ncertain\u201d (Leibniz to Huygens, Dec. 29, 1691, in Huygens 1888,\n10:228). Boyle was ahead of his time. In the next century\nd\u2019Alembert wrote \u201cthe taste for systems \u2026 is today\nalmost entirely banished from works of merit \u2026 a writer among\nus who praised systems would have come too late\u201d\n(d\u2019Alembert 1751 [1995,\n 94]).[2]\n\nBoyle was a corpuscularian, a term he employed to paper over the\ndifferences between believers in a vacuum, and believers in a plenum,\ngiven that both of them agreed that the explanation of natural\noccurrences should be solely in terms of particles of matter, their\nmotion and interaction. Boyle consistently refused to pronounce on the\nquestion of whether these minima naturalia should be\nconsidered atoms, in the strict sense of that term, or\n not.[3]\n\nEven a metaphysical non-corpuscularian such as Leibniz agreed with\nBoyle in practical terms. \u201cHowever much I agree with the\nScholastics in this general and, so to speak, metaphysical explanation\nof the principles of bodies,\u201d he wrote to Arnauld in July 1686,\n\u201cI am as corpuscular as one can be in the explanation of\nparticular phenomena, and it is saying nothing to allege that they\nhave forms or qualities\u201d (Gerhardt 1875, 2:58, trans. Mason\n1967).\n\nBoyle\u2019s scientific range was wide. Besides his well known work\nin mechanics, medicine, hydrostatics (Chalmers 2017, chap. 8) and a\nwide variety of experiments with his vacuum pump, he was interested\nboth theoretically and practically in alchemy (see Principe 1998,\nClericuzio 2000, Newman and Principe 2002), where his interest seems\nto have been fueled more by his constant desire to acquire knowledge\nof God and the world than by any desire for riches. He\n\u201ccultivated Chymistry with a disinterested mind,\u201d seeking\nthe improvement of his own knowledge, \u201cthe gratifying\nthe Curious & the Industrious; and the Acquist of some\nuseful helps to make good & uncommon\n Medicins.\u201d[4]\n As a corpuscularian he believed that transmutation was physically\npossible. As a person he believed that it actually occurred. He\nbelieved that in his own laboratory gold had been transmuted into a\n\u201cbaser metal\u201d with a specific gravity about two thirds of\nthat of gold, and since he was, he said, more interested in the\nluciferous aspect of discovery than the lucriferous, he found the\nprocess equally interesting in either\n direction.[5]\n\nDuring the course of his life he sought constantly to improve the lot\nof humanity. He was interested in the improvement of agricultural\nmethods, in the possibility of extracting fresh water from salt water,\nin the improvement of medicines and medicinal practice, in the\npossibility of preserving food by vacuum packing, and in a number of\nother useful results, actual or potential, of experimental philosophy.\nHe viewed his theological interests and his work in natural philosophy\nas forming a seamless whole and constantly used results from the one\narea to enlighten matters in the other. (On the relation between\nscience and religion in Boyle\u2019s thought see Hunter 2000 and\nWragge-Morley 2018.)\n\nConvinced that Christianity was the religion instituted by God, Boyle\nwas concerned that the Bible should be widely promulgated and he\ndevoted time and energy to having it translated into a variety of\nlanguages such as Irish, Turkish, and various native American\nlanguages. He viewed such conversion attempts as being on all fours\nwith his attempts to find more efficacious medicines for:\n\n\nTo convert Infidels to the Christian Religion is a work of great\nCharity and kindnes to men. I. In regard of the evills it frees them\nfrom, such as, (1) the gross errors and prejudices they had\nentertain\u2019d before they were instructed in it. (2ly) The vices\nand polutions they securely liv\u2019d in, before they receiv\u2019d\nthe Gospel; some of which were unworthy of men as such;\nothers very prejudicial to humane society\u2019s; and\nothers very mischievous to the vicious persons themselves;\nand others <againe> great hinderances to the discovery\nand reception of usefull and noble truths. (3ly) The unexpressible\nInfelicitys that attend the greatest part of such Infidels &\nwicked Persons, in the future state.\n\nII. The Christian Religion brings mankind diverse positive Benefits,\nsuch as are, more cleare and extensive knowledg of God, and divine\nthings; the Remission of Sins; the Favour of God; severall graces and\nvertues suitable to mens respective needs and conditions; and above\nall, a happy Immortality in the Life to come.
