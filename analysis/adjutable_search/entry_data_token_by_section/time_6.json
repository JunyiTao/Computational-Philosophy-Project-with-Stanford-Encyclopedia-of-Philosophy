    "main_text": "Three-Dimensionalism and Four-Dimensionalism\n7. Three-Dimensionalism and Four-Dimensionalism\n\nIn\n Section 4\n and\n Section 5\n we saw that there have been two main theories developed in response\nto McTaggart\u2019s Argument: The A-theory and The B-theory. Then, in\n Section 6\n we saw that there are two main ways of thinking about the relation\nbetween ontology and time: presentism and eternalism. (There was also\na third way, The Growing Block Theory, which we will mainly set aside\nfor the sake of simplicity in this section.) Two main ways of thinking\nabout time emerge from these discussions. On the one hand, A-theorists\nand presentists think that our pre-theoretical idea of time as flowing\nor passing, and thus being very different from the dimensions of\nspace, corresponds to something objective and real. B-theorists and\neternalists, on the other hand, reject the idea of time\u2019s\npassage and instead embrace the idea of time as being a dimension like\nspace. There is another important way in which philosophers in the\nsecond camp (the B-theory/eternalist camp) think time is like space,\nand it has to do with how objects and events persist over time. The\ndebate typically centers around the doctrine of \u201ctemporal\nparts\u201d, which those in the B-theory/eternalist camp tend to\naccept while those in the A-theory/presentist camp tend to reject.\n\nTo get an intuitive idea of what temporal parts are supposed to be,\nthink of a film strip depicting you as you walk across a room. It is\nmade up of many frames, and each frame shows you at a moment of time.\nNow picture cutting the frames, and stacking them, one on top of\nanother. Finally, imagine turning the stack sideways, so that the\ntwo-dimensional images of you are all right-side-up. Each image of you\nin one of these frames represents a temporal part of you, in\na specific position, at a particular location in space, at a single\nmoment of time. And what you are, on this way of thinking, is the\nfusion of all these temporal parts. You are a \u201cspacetime\nworm\u201d that curves through the four-dimensional manifold known as\nspacetime. Moreover, on this view, what it is to have a\nmomentary property at a time is to have a temporal part at the time\nthat has the property in question. So you are sitting right now in\nvirtue of the fact that your current temporal part is sitting.\n\nThe doctrine of temporal parts that B-theorists and eternalists tend\nto like can be stated like this:\n\n\nFour-Dimensionalism: Any physical object that is\nlocated at different times has a different temporal part for each\nmoment at which it is located.\n\n\nOn this view you have a temporal part right now, which is a\nthree-dimensional \u201ctime slice\u201d of you. And you have a\ndifferent temporal part at noon yesterday, but no temporal parts in\nthe year 1900 (since you are not located at any time in 1900). Also on\nthis view, the physical object that is you is a fusion of all of your\nmany temporal parts. (Note: there is a variation on the standard\nfour-dimensional view, which is sometimes called \u201cthe worm\nview\u201d. The variation, known as \u201cthe stage view\u201d,\nholds that names and personal pronouns normally refer, not to entire\nfusions of temporal parts but, rather, to the individual\nperson-stages, each of which is located at just an instant of time,\nand each of which counts as a person, rather than a mere part of a\nperson).\n\nThe opposing view is three-dimensionalism, which is just the denial of\nthe claim that temporally extended physical objects must have temporal\nparts. Here is a formulation of the view:\n\n\nThree-Dimensionalism: Any physical object that is\nlocated at different times is wholly present at each moment at which\nit is located.\n\n\nAccording to three-dimensionalism, the thing that was doing whatever\nyou were doing at noon yesterday was you. It was you who was doing\nthat, and now you are doing something different (namely, reading this\nsentence). So the relation between \u201cyou then\u201d and\n\u201cyou now\u201d is identity. According to\nfour-dimensionalism, on the other hand, the thing that was doing\nwhatever you were doing at noon yesterday was an earlier temporal part\nof the thing that is you, and the thing that is doing what you are\ndoing now is the present temporal part of you. The relation between\n\u201cyou then\u201d and \u201cyou now\u201d is the temporal\ncounterpart relation. (This is similar to the relation between\nyour left hand and your right hand, which is the spatial\ncounterpart relation. Your two hands are distinct parts of a\nbigger thing that contains them both.)\n\nDavid Lewis, one of the main proponents of four-dimensionalism,\nsuggests that the principal reason to accept the view is to solve what\nhe calls \u201cthe problem of temporary intrinsics\u201d. How can a\nsingle thing\u2014Lewis, for example\u2014have different intrinsic\nproperties\u2014like being straight, while he is standing, and then\nbeing bent, while seated\u2014at different times? Not by standing in\ndifferent relations\u2014the being straight at and being\nbent at relations\u2014to different times, he argues. (Since, he\nsays, being straight and being bent are genuine\nproperties rather than disguised relations.) And not in virtue of\nthere being only one reality\u2014such as the time when Lewis is\nbent\u2014so that reality consists of Lewis, and every other thing,\nbeing the way it is now and not any other way. (For Lewis points out\nthat we all believe we have a past and a future, in addition to a\npresent.) So Lewis suggests that the best answer to the question about\nhow a single thing can have different intrinsic properties at\ndifferent times is that such an object has different temporal parts\nwhich themselves have the different intrinsic properties.\n\nThere is, however, a natural three-dimensionalist response to this\nargument. It involves appealing to a certain way of thinking about\ntime, truth, and propositions that we touched on briefly in\n Section 1,\n namely, the idea that propositions are in some way\n\u201ctensed\u201d as opposed to \u201ctenseless\u201d. Here is a\nway to formulate the relevant semantic thesis:\n\n\nThe Tensed Conception of Semantics\n\nPropositions have truth values at times rather than\nsimpliciter and can, in principle, change their truth values\nover time.\nWe cannot eliminate verbal tenses like is, was,\nand will be from an ideal language.\n\n\n\nOn this view, a sentence like \u201cSullivan is eating a\nburrito\u201d expresses a proposition that used to be true, but is\nfalse now.\n\nThe alternative to the tensed conception of semantics is the\ntenseless conception of semantics. On the latter view, an\nutterance of a sentence like \u201cSullivan is eating a\nburrito\u201d expresses a proposition about a B-relation between\nevents\u2014it says that Sullivan\u2019s eating a burrito is\nsimultaneous with the utterance itself (or perhaps with the time of\nthe utterance). Here is a way of stating this view:\n\n\nThe Tenseless Conception of Semantics\n\nPropositions have truth values simpliciter rather than at\ntimes, and so cannot change their truth values over time.\nWe can in principle eliminate verbal tenses like is,\nwas, and will be from an ideal language.\n\n\n\nConsideration of Lewis\u2019s argument from temporary intrinsics has\nshown that a three-dimensionalist should probably endorse the tensed\nconception of semantics, in order to account for changing truths about\nthe world and its objects. And once we have seen this, it also becomes\nclear that A-theorists, presentists, and proponents of the growing\nblock theory all have similar reasons for adopting the tensed\nconception of semantics. For the A-theorist is committed to there\nbeing changing truths about which times and events are future, which\nare present, and which are past; and presentists and growing block\ntheorists are both committed to there being changing truths about what\nexists.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Hawley 2004 [2020];\nLewis 1986; Sider 2001; Thomson 1983; van Inwagen 1990\n",
