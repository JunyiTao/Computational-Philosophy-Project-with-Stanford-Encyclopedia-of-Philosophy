    "main_text": "Overview of the Structure of the Port-Royal Logic\n3. Overview of the Structure of the Port-Royal Logic\n\nThe text of the Logic is organized around the four mental\noperations important to the \u201cart of thinking\u201d:\nconceiving ideas, affirming and denying propositions\n(judging), affirming and denying propositions on the basis of\nother propositions (reasoning, i.e., inferring), and\nordering results of good reasoning. Logic is the sequential\napplication of these operations. Conceiving ideas is the \u201cfirst\naction\u201d of the mind, propositions are formed from ideas, and\nreasoning involves propositions. Ordering these products of thought\nconstitutes method. This organization reflects the point that\nlogic is taken to be primarily a science of the activity of thinking\nin the pursuit of knowledge. This framework for understanding logic is\nnow regarded as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d in opposition to both\nearlier and post-Fregean approaches that focus on methods for dealing\nwith formal aspects of reasoning.\n\nIntroductory material to the final (1683) edition includes a Preface\n(added 1683), a Foreword and First Discourse (1662), and a Second\nDiscourse (added 1664). The First Discourse lays out the plan of the\nLogic, explaining that its main purpose is to educate\njudgment to make it more precise. This is seen as instrumental for\nmaking the speculative sciences more useful. Thus the Logic\ncontains not only a treatment of correct reasoning, but also examples\nof how reasoning can go wrong. The Second Discourse offers a reply to\nobjections made to the first edition. The main point is to justify the\ncritical treatment of Aristotle on the ground that knowing how a great\nmind can err can help others avoid making the same mistakes. But it\nalso takes pains to point out that the Logic owes some things\nto Aristotle\u2019s Analytics and other works. The main text\nthat then follows is about the four mental operations with one Part\ndevoted to each.\n\nPart I on ideas consists of 15 chapters devoted to five topics: the\nnature and origin of ideas (chapter 1); the objects ideas represent\n(chapters 2\u20134); simple versus compound ideas (chapter 5); the\nlogical analysis of universal, particular, and singular ideas and the\nextension and comprehension of terms (chapters 6\u20138); and clear\nand distinct versus obscure and confused ideas, including a discussion\nof types of definition (chapters 9\u201315).\n\nPart II on judgment consists of 20 chapters. Recognizing that the mind\nclosely links ideas with the words that express them, their discussion\nbegins with an analysis of parts of speech in chapters 1 and 2.\nChapters 3 and 4 present a version of the Aristotelian theory of\ncategorical proposition and the square of opposition. Chapters\n5\u201314 treat the properties of simple, compound, and complex\npropositions, including how to identify and classify them. This\nsection contains the famous distinction between restrictive\n(\u201cdeterminative\u201d) and non-restrictive\n(\u201cexplicative\u201d) subordinate clauses (chapter 6), as well\nas a discussion of what we would now call logical connectives and\nnon-truth-functional propositions (chapter 9). The theory of\ndefinition returns in chapters 15 and 16 in the context of scientific\napplications. Finally, chapters 17\u201320 on the conversion of\npropositions contain part of the Port-Royal version of the medieval\ndoctrine of distribution.\n\nPart III focuses on rules for syllogistic reasoning, and is divided\ninto 20 chapters. Although the authors insist that most erroneous\nreasoning is based on false premises rather than incorrect inferences\n(Logic, 9), they believe the study of syllogistic forms can\nbe helpful for exercising the mind. The Logic classifies\nsyllogisms into simple and conjunctive, and simple syllogisms into\ncomplex and noncomplex (despite the awkward terminology). After\ndefining terms in chapters 1 and 2, they present general rules for\nsimple, noncomplex syllogisms in chapter 3. This chapter completes\ntheir reworked version of the theory of the distribution of terms,\nbegun in the last four chapters of Part II. Chapters 4 through 8\nexplain with innovative compactness (albeit still with tedious detail)\nthe figures and moods of simple syllogisms, again reproducing\ntraditional Aristotelian and medieval results. In chapters 9 through\n13 the Logic treats in a less formal way principles for\nrecognizing validity in syllogisms that are not simple. Chapters 14,\n15, and 16 discuss respectively enthymemes, sorites (syllogisms with\nmore than three propositions) and dilemmas. Despite their view that\nthe traditional theory of topics (the method for finding arguments) is\nespecially lacking utility, the authors treat it in chapters 17 and\n18. \u201cThose who object to this can spare themselves by not\nreading them\u201d (Logic, 11). Here they criticize\nAristotle, Ramus, and the Scholastics. Finally, chapters 19 and 20\ndiscuss sophisms and fallacies.\n\nThe Logic ends with Part IV on method. The first three Parts\nof the book correspond to the tripartite layout of traditional logic\ntexts. Part IV, however, constitutes an innovation reflecting the\nauthors\u2019 enthusiasm for the philosophy of Descartes and Pascal.\nChapter 1 lays the groundwork in Descartes\u2019 and\nAugustine\u2019s rationalism, criticizing the role of the senses in\nproviding knowledge, as well as the claims of Academic and Pyrrhonian\nskeptics. After spelling out the methods of analysis and synthesis in\nchapter 2, chapters 3 through 10 focus on the methods of geometry,\nincluding rules of definitions, axioms, and demonstrations. Chapter 11\nthen recapituates eight rules of scientific method. Finally, chapters\n12 through 16 contrast the nature of rationally obtained knowledge\nwith faith or belief.\n",
