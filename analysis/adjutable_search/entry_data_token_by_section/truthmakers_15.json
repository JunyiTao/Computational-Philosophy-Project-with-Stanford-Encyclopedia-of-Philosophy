    "main_text": "What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers? || Truth-making and Conceptual Explanation\n3.5 Truth-making and Conceptual Explanation\n\nOther philosophers appeal to the idea that when we say that a\nstatement is true because a truth-maker for it exists, the\n\u201cbecause\u201d we employ is a connective (K\u00fcnne 2003:\n150\u20136; Hornsby 2005: 35\u20137; Melia 2005: 78\u20139;\nSchnieder 2006a: 29\u201337; Mulligan 2007). They think of this\nconnective on the model of logical operators (\u201c&\u201d,\n\u201c\u223c\u201d etc.) i.e., expressions that link sentences but\nwithout expressing a relation that holds between the states of\naffairs, facts or tropes that these sentences denote; but unlike\n\u201c&\u201d, \u201c\u223c\u201d etc., \u201cbecause\u201d\nis not truth-functional. According to these philosophers, the\ntruth-maker panegyrists have misconstrued the logical form of\n\u201cmakes true\u201d. They have taken it to be a verb like\n\u201cx hits y\u201d when really it is akin to the\nconnective \u201c\u2192\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d (Melia 2005:\n78). There\u2019s no need to introduce truth-makers as the special\nthings that stand at one end of the truth-making relation\nwith true statements at the other, no need to because it\u2019s only\nsuperficial features of the grammar of our language that suggest there\nis a truth-making relation to stand at the ends of.\n\nTypically philosophers who maintain that \u201cmakes true\u201d is a\nconnective do not argue for this conclusion directly but encourage us\nto dwell upon the fact that it natural to hear the\n\u201cbecause\u201d that occurs in equivalent constructions as a\nconnective. When we hear, e.g., \u201cIt is true that the rose is red\nbecause the rose is red\u201d we don\u2019t naturally hear it as\nexpressing a binary relation between two things. So we shouldn\u2019t\nhear, or at least don\u2019t have to hear, \u201cIt\u2019s true\nthat the rose is red in virtue of the rose\u2019s being red\u201d or\n\u201cthe rose\u2019s being red makes it true that the rose is\nred\u201d as a expressing a binary relation between a truth and\ntruth-maker either.\n\nK\u00fcnne has gone further and suggested that the truth-making\nconnective is really the \u201cbecause\u201d of conceptual\nexplanation (2003: 154\u20135; see also Schnieder 2006a: 36\u20137).\nHe encourages us to hear the equivalence between,\n\n(R)\n He is a child of a sibling of one of your parents, which makes\nhim your first cousin\n\n\nand,\n\n(R*)\n He is your first cousin because he is a child of a sibling of one\nof your parents.\n\n\nHe tells us that the \u201cbecause\u201d in (R*) is the\n\u201cbecause\u201d of \u201cconceptual explanation\u201d. Since\n(R) and (R*) are equivalent, he concludes that the\n\u201cmakes\u201d construction in (R) is just a cumbersome\nway of expressing the \u201cbecause\u201d of conceptual explanation\nin (R*). K\u00fcnne then invites us take the use of\n\u201cmakes\u201d in (R) as a model for understanding the\ntruth-making construction,\n\n(S)\n The fact that snow is white makes the statement that snow is\nwhite true.\n\n\nThis enables us to see that (S) does \u201cnot affirm a\nrelation of any kind between a truth vehicle and something in the\nworld\u201d (K\u00fcnne 2003: 155). Why? Because it is equivalent\nto,\n\n(S*)\n The statement that snow is white is true because snow is\nwhite.\n\n\na claim that makes no (explicit) mention of facts. Moreover, the\nsecond clause of (S*), like the second clause of\n(R*), tells us when it is correct to affirm its first clause.\nIn both cases we have an explanation that draws respectively upon our\nunderstanding of the concepts cousin and truth.\nDrawing upon these materials, we are then able to construct an\nexplanation of the felt asymmetry whereby the truth of what we say\nabout the world depends upon what the world is like, but not the other\nway around. What is written on the left-hand-side of (S*) is\nconceptually more sophisticated than what is written upon the\nright-hand-side because the former requires us to be able to grasp the\nconcepts of statement and truth to understand it\nwhereas the latter does not. Accordingly the latter requires less of\nboth the world and us than the former to be both understood and true.\nThat\u2019s why it makes sense to deploy the right-hand-side (a claim\nabout reality) to explain the left-hand-side (a claim about a truth\nbearer) but not the other way around (Hornsby 2005: 44; Dodd 2007:\n399\u2013400). It may still be that this is just wishful thinking,\nuntil it has been established that the \u201cbecause\u201d of truth\nmaking is a connective rather than a relational expression\u2014i.e.,\nnot just because it would be technically convenient for us to believe\nit to be so or because it sounds like a connective to someone with the\nears of a naive grammarian. As we saw in section 1.6, some advocates\nof truth-making as grounding also consider \u201cbecause\u201d to be\na connective, although there is much disagreement about its\nimplications. Some early exponents of the connective view of\ntruth-making have embraced grounding (e.g. Schnieder), while others\nhave not (e.g. Hornsby and Dodd). \n",
