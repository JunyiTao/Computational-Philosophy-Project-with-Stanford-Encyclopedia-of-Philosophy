    "main_text": "\n1. History and Scope\n\n\nThe second half of the twentieth century saw the emergence of\nlarge-scale political movements\u2014second wave feminism, Black Civil\nRights in the U.S., gay and lesbian liberation, and the American Indian\nmovements, for example\u2014based in claims about the injustices done\nto particular social groups. These social movements are undergirded by\nand foster a philosophical body of literature that takes up questions\nabout the nature, origin and futures of the identities being defended.\nIdentity politics as a mode of organizing is intimately connected to\nthe idea that some social groups are oppressed; that is, that\none\u2019s identity as a woman or as African American, for example,\nmakes one peculiarly vulnerable to cultural imperialism (including\nstereotyping, erasure, or appropriation of one\u2019s group identity),\nviolence, exploitation, marginalization, or powerlessness (Young 1990).\nIdentity politics starts from analyses of such forms of social\ninjustice to recommend, variously, the reclaiming, redescription, or\ntransformation of previously stigmatized accounts of group membership.\nRather than accepting the negative scripts offered by a dominant\nculture about one\u2019s own inferiority, one transforms one\u2019s\nown sense of self and community. For example, in their germinal\nstatement of Black feminist identity politics, the Combahee River\nCollective argued that \n\n\n\nas children we realized that we were different from boys and that we\nwere treated different\u2014for example, when we were told in the same\nbreath to be quiet both for the sake of being \u2018ladylike\u2019\nand to make us less objectionable in the eyes of white people. In the\nprocess of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to\nrecognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and\ngrowing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives\nand inevitably end our oppression. (1982: 14\u201315)\n\n\n\nThe scope of political movements that may be described as identity\npolitics is broad: the examples used in the philosophical literature\nare predominantly of struggles for recognition and social justice by\ngroups of citizens within western capitalist democracies, but\nIndigenous rights movements worldwide, nationalist projects, or demands\nfor regional self-determination use similar arguments. Predictably,\nthere is no straightforward criterion that makes a political struggle\ninto an example of \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Rather, the term\nsignifies a loose collection of political projects, each undertaken by\nrepresentatives of a collective with a distinctively different social\nlocation that has hitherto been neglected, erased, or suppressed. It is\nbeyond the scope of this essay to offer historical or sociological\nsurveys of the many different social movements that might be described\nas identity politics, although references to this literature are\nprovided in the bibliography; instead the focus here is to provide an\noverview of the philosophical issues in the expansive literature in\npolitical theory.\n\nThe phrase \u201cidentity politics\u201d is also something of a\nphilosophical punching-bag for a variety of critics. Often challenges\nfail to make sufficiently clear their object of critique, using\n\u201cidentity politics\u201d as a blanket description that invokes a\nrange of tacit political failings. From a contemporary perspective,\nsome early identity claims by political activists certainly seem naive,\ntotalizing, or unnuanced. However, the public rhetoric of identity\npolitics served useful and empowering purposes for some, even while it\nsometimes belied the philosophical complexity of any claim to a shared\nexperience or common group characteristics. Since the twentieth century\nheyday of the well-known political movements that made identity\npolitics so visible, a vast academic literature has sprung up; although\n\u201cidentity politics\u201d can draw on intellectual precursors\nfrom Mary Wollstonecraft to Franz Fanon, writing that actually uses\nthis specific phrase, with any of its contemporary baggage, does not\nbegin until the late 1970s. Thus it was barely as intellectuals started\nto systematically outline and defend the philosophical underpinnings of\nidentity politics that we simultaneously began to challenge them. At\nthis historical juncture, then, asking whether one is for or against\nidentity politics is to ask an impossible question. Wherever they line\nup in the debates, thinkers agree that the notion\nof identity has become indispensable to contemporary\npolitical discourse, at the same time as they concur that it has\ntroubling implications for models of the self, political inclusiveness,\nand our possibilities for solidarity and resistance.\n2. Philosophy and Identity\n\nFrom this brief examination of how identity politics fits into the\npolitical landscape it is already clear that the use of the\ncontroversial term \u201cidentity\u201d raises a host of\nphilosophical questions. Logical uses aside, it is likely familiar to\nphilosophers from the literature in metaphysics on personal\nidentity\u2014one\u2019s sense of self and its persistence. Indeed,\nunderlying many of the more overtly pragmatic debates about the merits\nof identity politics are philosophical questions about the nature of\nsubjectivity and the self (Taylor 1989). Charles Taylor argues that the\nmodern identity is characterized by an emphasis on its inner voice and\ncapacity for authenticity\u2014that is, the ability to\nfind a way of being that is somehow true to oneself (Taylor 1994).\nWhile doctrines of equality press the notion that each human being is\ncapable of deploying their practical reason or moral sense to live\nan authentic life qua individual, the politics of difference has\nappropriated the language of authenticity to describe ways of living\nthat are true to the identities of marginalized social groups. As Sonia\nKruks puts it:\n\nWhat makes identity politics a significant departure from earlier,\npre-identarian forms of the politics of recognition is its demand for\nrecognition on the basis of the very grounds on which recognition has\npreviously been denied: it\nis qua women, qua blacks, qua lesbians\nthat groups demand recognition. The demand is not for inclusion within\nthe fold of \u201cuniversal humankind\u201d on the basis of shared\nhuman attributes; nor is it for respect \u201cin spite of\u201d\none\u2019s differences. Rather, what is demanded is respect for\noneself as different (2001: 85).\n\nFor some proponents of identity politics this demand for\nauthenticity includes appeals to a time before oppression, or a culture\nor way of life damaged by colonialism, imperialism, or even genocide.\nThus for example Taiaiake Alfred, in his defense of a return to\ntraditional Indigenous values, argues that:\n\nIndigenous governance systems embody distinctive political values,\nradically different from those of the mainstream. Western notions of\ndomination (human and natural) are noticeably absent; in their place we\nfind harmony, autonomy, and respect. We have a responsibility to\nrecover, understand, and preserve these values, not only because they\nrepresent a unique contribution to the history of ideas, but because\nrenewal of respect for traditional values is the only lasting solution\nto the political, economic, and social problems that beset our people.\n(Alfred 1999: 5)\n\nWhat is crucial about the \u201cidentity\u201d of identity\npolitics appears to be the experience of the subject, especially their\nexperience within social structures that generate injustice, and the\npossibility of a shared and more authentic or self-determined\nalternative. Thus identity politics rests on the connection between a\ncertain undergoing and the subject-position to which it is attributed,\nand hence on unifying claims about the meaning of politically laden\nexperiences to diverse individuals. Sometimes the meaning given to a\nparticular experience will diverge from that of its subject: thus, for\nexample, the victim of sexual violence who is told they caused their\nown fate by taking risks, when they believe their attacker is culpable.\nMaking sense of such interpretive gaps depends on methods that\nrecognize the divergence between dominant epistemic accounts and\nsubjugated knowledges (Alcoff 2018). Thus concern about this aspect of\nidentity politics has crystallized around the transparency of\nexperience, and the univocality of its interpretation. Experience is\nnever, critics argue, simply epistemically available prior to\ninterpretation (Scott 1992); rather it requires a theoretical\nframework\u2014implicit or explicit\u2014to give it meaning (Heyes\n2020). Moreover, if experience is the origin of politics, then some\ncritics worry that what Kruks (2001) calls \u201can epistemology of\nprovenance\u201d will become the norm: on this view, political\nperspectives gain legitimacy by virtue of their articulation by\nsubjects of particular experiences. This, critics charge, closes off\nthe possibility of critique of these perspectives by those who\ndon\u2019t share the experience, which in turn inhibits political\ndialogue and coalition-building. Nonetheless, skepticism about the\npossibility of experience outside a hermeneutic frame has been\njuxtaposed (or even reconciled) with phenomenological attempts to\narticulate a ground for experience in the lived body (Alcoff 2000; see\nalso Oksala 2004 and 2011; Stoller 2009; Heyes 2020), or in related\naccounts of complex embodiment (Siebers 2017). Recent work in Black\nfeminist philosophy has also returned to identity political language by\nseeking to ground political perspectives in storytelling: for example,\nKristie Dotson (2018) argues that a Black feminism starting from\npersonal narrative provides a practice that can undercut unknowing in\nsettler colonial contexts.\n\nFrom these understandings of subjectivity, it is easy to see how\ncritics of identity politics, and even some cautious supporters, have\nwondered how it can meet the challenges of intersectionality\n(Hill Collins and Bilge 2016). Intersectionality is both an ontology\nand a method, with origins in women of color feminisms, especially\nBlack feminisms (Crenshaw 1989, 1990; Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall 2013;\nHancock 2016). Its central tenet is that no axis of identity can be\nunderstood as separable from others\u2014whether in terms of\nindividual experience or the political structures that underlie social\nstratification. To speak of \u201cpeople of color\u201d without\ndistinguishing between class, gender, sexuality, national and ethnic\ncontexts, for example, is to risk representing the experience of only\nsome of the group\u2019s members\u2014typically those who are most\nprivileged. To the extent that identity politics urges mobilization\naround a single axis, it will put pressure on participants to identify\nthat axis as their defining feature, when in fact they may well\nunderstand themselves as integrated selves who cannot be represented so\nselectively or reductively (Carastathis 2017). Generalizations made\nabout particular social groups in the context of identity politics may\nalso come to have a disciplinary function within the group, not just\ndescribing but also dictating the self-understanding that its members\nshould have. Thus, the supposedly liberatory new identity may inhibit\nautonomy, as Anthony Appiah puts it, replacing \u201cone kind of\ntyranny with another\u201d (1994: 163). Just as dominant groups\nin the culture at large insist that the marginalized integrate by\nassimilating to dominant norms, so within some practices of identity\npolitics dominant sub-groups may, in theory and practice, impose their\nvision of the group\u2019s identity onto all its members.\n\nFor example, a common narrative of U.S. feminist history points to\nuniversalizing claims made on behalf of women during the so-called\n\u201csecond wave\u201d of the feminist movement in the late 1960s\nand 1970s. The most often discussed (and criticized) second wave\nfeminist icons\u2014women such as Betty Friedan or Gloria\nSteinem\u2014are white, middle-class, and heterosexual, although this\nhistorical picture itself too often neglects the contributions of\nlesbian feminists, feminists of color, and working-class feminists,\nwhich were less visible in popular culture, perhaps, but equally\ninfluential in the lives of women. For some early radical feminists,\nwomen\u2019s oppression as women was the core of\nidentity politics and should not be diluted with other identity issues.\nFor example, Shulamith Firestone, in her classic book The\nDialectic of Sex, argued that \u201cracism is sexism\nextended,\u201d and that the Black Power movement represented\nonly sexist cooptation of Black women into a new kind of subservience\nto Black men. Thus for Black women to fight racism (especially among\nwhite women) was to divide the feminist movement, which properly\nfocused on challenging patriarchy, understood as struggle between men\nand women, the foundational dynamic of all oppressions (Firestone 1970:\nesp. 103\u2013120).\n\nSuch claims about the universality of gender have therefore been\nextensively criticized in feminist theory for failing to recognize the\nspecificity of their own constituencies. Friedan\u2019s famous\nproposition that women needed to get out of the household and into the\nprofessional workplace was, bell hooks pointed out, predicated on the\nexperience of a post-war generation of white, middle-class married\nwomen limited to housekeeping and child-rearing by their professional\nhusbands (Friedan 1963; hooks 1981). Many women of color and\nworking-class women had worked outside their homes (sometimes\nin other women\u2019s homes) for decades; some\nlesbians had a history of working in traditionally male occupations or\nliving alternative domestic lives without a man\u2019s \u201cfamily\nwage.\u201d Theorizing the experience of hybridity for those whose\nidentities are especially far from norms of univocality, Gloria\nAnzald\u00faa, for example, writes of\nher mestiza identity as a Chicana, American, raised\npoor, a lesbian and a feminist, living in the metaphoric and literal\nBorderlands of the American Southwest (1999 [1987]). Some women from\nthe less developed world have been critical of Northern feminist theory\nfor globalizing its claims. Such moves construct \u201cThird\nWorld\u201d women, they argue, as less developed or enlightened\nversions of their \u201cFirst World\u201d counterparts, rather than\nunderstanding their distinctively different situation (Mohanty 1991\n[1984]); or, they characterize liberation for Northern women in ways\nthat exacerbate the exploitation of the global poor\u2014by supporting\neconomic conditions in which increasing numbers of western women can\nabuse migrant domestic workers, for example (Anderson 2000). The\nquestion of what a global feminism should make of identity political\nclaims, or how it should conceive solidarity among women from massively\ndifferent locations within the global economic system remains open\n(Weir 2008).\n\nFurther complicating intersectional methods, the very categories of\nidentity that are taken to intersect may themselves be thought of as\nhistorically contingent and variable. To take the example of\n\u201crace,\u201d despite a complex history of biological\nessentialism in the presentation of racial typologies, the notion of a\ngenetic basis to racial difference has been largely discredited; the\ncriteria different societies (at different times) use to organize and\nhierarchize \u201cracial formations\u201d are political and\ncontingent (Omi and Winant 1994 [1986]). While some human physical\ntraits are in a trivial sense genetically determined, the grouping of\ndifferent persons into races does not pick out any patterned\nbiological difference. What it does pick out is a set of social\nmeanings with political ramifications (Alcoff 1997, 2006). The most\nnotorious example of an attempt to rationalize racial difference as\nbiological is the U.S. \u201cone-drop rule,\u201d under which an\nindividual was characterized as Black if they had \u201cone\ndrop\u201d or more of \u201cBlack blood.\u201d Adrian Piper points\nout that not only does this belief persist into contemporary readings\nof racial identity, it also implies that given the prolonged history\nof racial mixing in the US\u2014both coerced and voluntary\u2014very\nsignificant numbers of nominally \u201cwhite\u201d people in the\nU.S.  today should be re-classified as \u201cBlack\u201d (Piper\n1996). In those countries that have had official racial\nclassifications, individuals\u2019 struggles to be re-classified\n(almost always as a member of a more privileged racial group) are\noften invoked to highlight the contingency of race, especially at the\nborders of its categories. And a number of histories of racial groups\nthat have apparently changed their racial identification\u2014Jews,\nItalians, or the Irish, for example\u2014also illustrate genealogical\ntheses (Ignatiev 1995). The claim that race is \u201csocially\nconstructed,\u201d however, does not in itself mark out a specific\nidentity politics. Indeed, the very contingency of race and its lack\nof correlation with categories that have more meaning in everyday life\n(such as ethnicity or culture) may circumscribe its political\nusefulness: just as feminists have found the limits of appeals to\n\u201cwomen\u2019s identity,\u201d so Asian-Americans may find with\nethnicities and cultures as diverse as Chinese, Indian, or Vietnamese\nthat their racial designation itself provides little common ground.\nThat a US citizen of both Norwegian and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage will\ncheck that they are \u201cwhite\u201d on a census form says\nrelatively little (although in a post-Trump U.S., it arguably says\nmore [Jardina 2019]) about their experience of their identity, or\nindeed of their very different relationship to anti-Semitism. Tropes\nof separatism and the search for forms of authentic self-expression\nare related to race via ethno-cultural understandings of identity: for\nexample, the U.S.  Afrocentric movement appeals to the cultural\nsignificance of African heritage for Black Americans (Asante\n2000).\n\nCritical engagement with the origins and conceptualization of\nsubjectivity also informs poststructuralist challenges to identity\npolitics. They charge that it rests on a mistaken view of the subject\nthat assumes a metaphysics of substance\u2014that is,\nthat a cohesive, self-identical subject is ontologically (if not\nactually) prior to any form of social injustice (Butler 1999 [1990]).\nThis subject has certain core essential attributes that define her or\nhis identity, over which are imposed forms of socialization that cause\nher or him to internalize other nonessential attributes. This position,\nthey suggest, misrepresents both the ontology of identity and its\npolitical significance. The alternative view offered by\npoststructuralists is that the subject is itself always already a\nproduct of discourse, which represents both the condition of\npossibility for a certain subject-position and a constraint on what\nforms of self-making individuals may engage in. There is no real\nidentity\u2014individual or group-based\u2014that is separable from\nits conditions of possibility, and any political appeal to identity\nformations must engage with the paradox of acting from the very\nsubject-positions it must also oppose. Central to this position is the\nobservation that any claim to identity must organize itself around a\nconstitutive exclusion:\n\nAn identity is established in relation to a series of differences\nthat have become socially recognized. These differences are essential\nto its being. If they did not coexist as differences, it would not\nexist in its distinctness and solidity. Entrenched in this\nindispensable relation is a second set of tendencies, themselves in\nneed of exploration, to conceal established identities into fixed\nforms, thought and lived as if their structure expressed the true order\nof things. When these pressures prevail, the maintenance of one\nidentity (or field of identities) involves the conversion of some\ndifferences into otherness, into evil, or one of its numerous\nsurrogates. Identity requires differences in order to be, and it\nconverts difference into otherness in order to secure its own\nself-certainty. (Connolly 2002: 64)\n\nThe danger of identity politics, then, is that it casts as authentic\nto the self or group a self-understanding that in fact is defined by\nits opposition to a dominant identity, which typically represents\nitself as neutral. Reclaiming such an identity as one\u2019s own\nmerely reinforces its dependence on this Other, and further\ninternalizes and reinforces an oppressive hierarchy. This danger\nis frequently obscured by claims that particular identities are\nessential or natural, as we saw with race. For example, some early\ngay activists emphasized the immutable and essential\nnatures of their sexual identities. They were a distinctively\ndifferent natural kind of person, with the same rights as (white,\nmiddle-class) heterosexuals (another natural kind) to find fulfillment\nin marriage and family life, property ownership, personal wealth\naccumulation, and consumer culture. This strand of organizing\n(associated more closely with white, middle-class gay men) with its\ncomplex simultaneous appeals to difference and to sameness has a\ngenealogy going back to pre-Stonewall homophilic activism (see\ndiscussion in Terry 1999, esp. 353\u20137). While early lesbian\nfeminists had a very different politics, oriented around liberation\nfrom patriarchy and the creation of separate spaces for\nwoman-identified women, many still appealed to a more authentic,\ndistinctively feminist womanhood. Heterosexual feminine identities were\nproducts of oppression, yet the literature imagines a utopian\nalternative where woman-identification will liberate the lesbian within\nevery woman (e.g., Radicalesbians 1988 [1970]). The paradigm shift that\nthe term \u201cqueer\u201d signals, then, is a shift to a model in\nwhich identities are more self-consciously historicized, seen as\ncontingent products of particular genealogies rather than enduring or\nessential natural kinds (Phelan 1989 and 1994; Blasius 2001). Michel\nFoucault\u2019s History of Sexuality famously argues\nthat \u201chomosexuality appeared as one of the forms of\nsexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a\nkind of interior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite\nhad been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a\nspecies\u201d (Foucault 1978: 43). Although Foucault is the most\noften cited as the originator of such genealogical arguments about\nhomosexuality, other often neglected writers contributed to the\nemergence of this new paradigm (e.g., M. McIntosh 1968). Such theories\nstill co-exist uneasily with popularized essentialist accounts of\ngender and sexual identity, which purport to look for a particular\ngene, brain structure, or other biological feature that is\nnoninteractive with environment and that will explain gender-normative\nbehavior (including sometimes trans identity) and same-sex sexual desire.\n\nAt stake are not only epistemological and metaphysical questions about\nhow we can know what kind of thing \u201csexual orientation\u201d\nmight be, but also a host of moral and political questions. Some gay\nactivists thus see biological explanations of sexuality as offering a\ndefense against homophobic commentators who believe that gay men and\nlesbians can voluntarily change their desires.  Indeed, much of the\nintuitive hostility to genealogical or poststructuralist accounts of\nsexuality within gay and lesbian communities even today seems to come\nfrom the dual sense of many individuals that they could not have been\nother than gay, and that anything less than a radically essentialist\nview of sexuality will open the door to further attempts to\n\u201ccure\u201d them of their homosexuality (through\n\u201cconversion therapy,\u201d for example).  Nonetheless, it is\nperfectly possible to argue that the experience of one\u2019s bodily\nfeelings and concomitant sense of self having an origin solely inside\noneself is both deeply felt and in this sense real, and an experience\nwith a history larger than the individual (Heyes 2007; Salamon\n2010). Furthermore, as Eve Sedgwick argues, no specific form of\nexplanation for the origins of sexual preference will be proof against\nthe infinitely varied strategies of homophobia (Sedgwick 1990:\nesp. 22\u201363). That sexual orientation takes on a metaphysical\nlife of its own elides the fact that it is generally sexual\nbehavior\u2014not an abstract \u201cidentity\u201d\u2014that is\nthe object of moral disapprobation. Queer politics, then,\nworks to trouble the categories \u201cgay\u201d and\n\u201clesbian,\u201d as well as \u201cheterosexual\u201d (or\nindeed other categories of social thought in general), and point out\nthat the homo/hetero dichotomy, like many others in western\nintellectual history that it arguably draws on and reinforces, is not\nonly mutually implicated, but also hierarchical (heterosexuality is\nsuperior, normal, and originary, while homosexuality is inferior,\ndeviant, and derivative) and masquerades as natural or\ndescriptive.\n\nThese conflicting positions within gender and sexual politics are\nexemplified in the history of the expansion of gay and lesbian\norganizing to those with other queer affiliations. Those describing\nthemselves as \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian\u201d wondered if\nbisexual and transgender (and then intersex, Two Spirit, asexual, and\nmore) people shared sufficiently similar experience and interests to\nmake an identity political movement. Indeed, this suspicion sometimes\nworked in the opposite direction: not all trans or intersex people have\nunderstood themselves to be queer, or to share the same political goals\nas gay and lesbian organizers, for example. The debate finds a parallel\nin a form of challenge to the inclusion of transwomen in women-only\nspaces (or indeed, their identification as \u201cwomen\u201d in the\nfirst place). The possibility of feminist solidarity across cis and\ntrans lines hinges on the centrality of sex and gender\nidentities\u2014and how those are understood\u2014to political spaces\nand organizing (Heyes 2003). Traditions of trans, mestiza, and cyborg\nfeminist politics have resisted the claim of sameness and recommended\nmodels that embrace the historicity of subject-positions and\nintrasubjective plurality (Stone 1991; Haraway 1991; Lugones 1994; see\nBettcher 2014 for an overview).\n\nWhile the common charge that identity politics promotes a victim\nmentality is often made glibly, Wendy Brown offers a more sophisticated\ncaution against the dangers of ressentiment (the\nmoralizing revenge of the powerless). She argues that identity politics\nhas its own genealogy in liberal capitalism that relentlessly\nreinforces the \u201cwounded attachments\u201d it claims to\nsever: \u201cPoliticized identity thus enunciates itself, makes\nclaims for itself, only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and\ninscribing its pain in politics; it can hold out no future\u2014for\nitself or others\u2014that triumphs over this pain\u201d (Brown 1995:\n74). The challenge that identity politics retains attachments to\nhierarchized categories defined in opposition to each other and\nover-identifies with artifactual wounds has been met with more\ndiscussion of the temporality of identity politics: can an\nidentification be premised on a forward-looking solidarity rather than\na ressentiment-laden exclusion (see Zerilli 2005; Weir\n2008; Bhambra and Margee 2010)? It also invites consideration of\nwhether pain is always a regressive, fixed ground of identity claims,\nor whether it might be a legitimate reality for mobilization, as Tobin\nSiebers suggests of disability (2017: 322\u20133). Some proponents of\nidentity politics have suggested that poststructuralism is politically\nimpotent, capable only of deconstruction and never of action (Hartsock\n1998: 205\u2013226). There are, however, political projects motivated\nby poststructuralist theses. For example, Judith Butler\u2019s famous\narticulation of performativity as a way of\nunderstanding subject-development suggests to her and others the\npossibility of disarticulating seamless performances to subvert the\nmeanings with which they are invested (Butler 1999 [1990]). Drag maybe\nconstituted such a disarticulation, although other critics have\nsuggested other examples; Adrian Piper\u2019s conceptual art seeks to\ndisrupt the presumed self-identity of race by showing how it is\nactively interpreted and reconstituted, never determinate and\nself-evident. Linda Zerilli discusses the \u201cworld-building\u201d\nwork of the Milan Women\u2019s Bookstore Collective\u2014a feminist\ngroup that rejects a subject-centred view of women\u2019s injured\nstatus in favor of a protensive practice of freedom (2005: chapter\n3).\n3. Liberalism and Identity Politics\n\nInstitutionalized liberal democracy is a key condition of\npossibility for contemporary identity politics. The citizen\nmobilizations that made democracy real also shaped and unified groups\npreviously marginal to the polity, while extensions of formal rights\ninvited expectations of material and symbolic equality. The perceived\npaucity of rewards offered by liberal capitalism, however, spurred\nforms of radical critique that sought to explain the persistence of\ninequity. At the most basic philosophical level, critics of liberalism\nsuggested that liberal social ontology\u2014the model of the nature of\nand relationship between subjects and collectives\u2014was misguided.\nThe social ontology of most liberal political theories consists of\ncitizens conceptualized as essentially similar individuals, as for\nexample in John Rawls\u2019 famous thought experiment using the\n\u201coriginal position,\u201d in which representatives of the\ncitizenry are conceptually divested of all specific identities or\naffiliations in order to make rational decisions about the social\ncontract (Rawls 1971). To the extent that group interests are\nrepresented in liberal polities, they tend to be understood as\nassociational, forms of interest group pluralism whereby those sharing\nparticular interests voluntarily join together to create a political\nlobby. Citizens are free to register their individual preferences\n(through voting, for example), or to aggregate themselves for the\nopportunity to lobby more systematically (e.g., by forming an\nassociation such as a neighborhood community league). These lobbies,\nhowever, are not defined by the identity of their members so much as by\nspecific shared interests and goals, and when pressing their case the\nmarginalized subjectivity of the group members is not itself called\ninto question. Finally, political parties, the other primary organs of\nliberal democratic government, critics suggest, have few moments of\ninclusivity, being organized around party discipline, responsiveness to\nlobby groups, and broad-based electoral popularity. Ultimately\nconventional liberal democracy, diverse radical critics claim, cannot\neffectively address the ongoing structural marginalization that\npersists in late capitalist liberal states, and may even be complicit\nwith it (Young 1990; P. Williams 1991; Brown 1995; M. Williams 1998;\nMills 2017).\n\nOn a philosophical level, liberal understandings of the political\nsubject and its relationship to collectivity came to seem inadequate to\nensuring representation for women, gay men and lesbians, or racial-ethnic\ngroups (M. Williams 1998). Critics charged that the neutral citizen of\nliberal theory was in fact the bearer of an identity coded white, male,\nbourgeois, able, and heterosexual (Pateman 1988; Young 1990; Di Stefano\n1991; Mills 1997; Pateman and Mills 2007). This implicit ontology in\npart explained the persistent historical failure of liberal democracies\nto achieve full inclusion in power structures for members of\nmarginalized groups. A richer understanding of political subjects as\nconstituted through and by their social location was required. In\nparticular, the history and experience of injustice brought with it\ncertain perspectives and needs that could not be assimilated through\nexisting institutions. Individuals are oppressed by virtue of their\nmembership in a particular social group\u2014that is, a\ncollective whose members have relatively little mobility into or out of\nthe collective, who usually experience their membership as involuntary,\nwho are generally identified as members by others, and whose\nopportunities are deeply shaped by the relation of their group to\ncorollary groups through privilege and oppression (Cudd 2006). Liberal\ndemocratic institutions have persistently grappled with the challenge\nof recognizing such asymmetries of identity while stressing procedural\nconsistency and literal equality in institutions. Thus for example the\ntwentieth-century U.S. discussion of the categories of race organized\naround color-blind versus color-conscious public policy (Appiah and\nGutmann 1996). Color-blindness\u2014that is, the view that\nrace should be ignored in public policy and everyday\nexchange\u2014had hegemony in popular discourse. Drawing attention to\nrace\u2014whether in a personal description or in university\nadmissions procedures\u2014was characterized as unfair and racist.\nAdvocates of color-consciousness, on the other hand, argued that racism\nwould not disappear without proactive efforts, which required the\ninvocation of race. Affirmative action requires statistics about the\nnumbers of members of oppressed racial groups employed in certain\ncontexts, which in turn requires racial identification and\ncategorization. Thus those working against racism face a paradox\nfamiliar in identity politics: the very identity they aim to transform\nmust be invoked to make their case.\n\nCritics have also charged that integration (or,\nmore provocatively, assimilation) is a guiding principle of liberalism\n(see Callan 2005). If the liberal subject is coded in the way Young\n(1990) suggests, then attempts to apply liberal norms of equality will\nrisk demanding that the marginalized conform to the identities of their\noppressors. For example, many commentators on the politics of gender\nand sexuality objected to campaigns defending \u201cgay\nmarriage\u201d or otherwise representing queer people as living up to\nheterosexual (white, or middle-class) norms, on the grounds that these\nlegal developments assimilate same-sex relationships to an existing\ndominant model, rather than challenging its historical, material, and\nsymbolic terms (e.g., Card 2007; Puar 2017). If this\nis equality, they claim, then it looks suspiciously like\nthe erasure of socially subordinate identities rather than their\ngenuine incorporation into the polity. One of the central charges\nagainst identity politics by liberals, among others, has been its\nalleged reliance on notions of sameness to justify political\nmobilization. Looking for people who are like you rather\nthan who share your political values as allies runs the risk of\nsidelining critical political analysis of complex social locations and\nghettoizing members of social groups as the only persons capable of\nmaking or understanding claims to justice. After an initial wave of\nrelatively uncompromising identity politics, proponents have taken\nthese criticisms to heart and moved to more philosophically nuanced\naccounts that appeal to coalitions as better\norganizing structures. On this view, separatism around a single\nidentity formation must be muted by recognition of the intersectional\nnature of social group memberships. The idea of a dominant identity\nfrom which the oppressed may need to dissociate themselves remains, but\nthe alternative becomes a more fluid and diverse grouping, less intent\non guarantees of internal homogeneity.\n\nFinally, the literature on multiculturalism takes up questions of\nrace, ethnicity, and cultural diversity in relation to the liberal\nstate (Levy 2000; Kymlicka 2001). Some multicultural\nstates\u2014notably Canada\u2014allegedly aim to permit the various\ncultural identities of their residents to be preserved rather than\nassimilated, despite the concern that the over-arching liberal aims of\nsuch states may be at odds with the values of those they claim to\nprotect. For example, Susan Moller Okin argued that multiculturalism is\nsometimes \u201cbad for women,\u201d especially when it works to\npreserve patriarchal values in minority cultures. If multiculturalism\nimplies a form of cultural relativism that prevents judgment of or\ninterference with the \u201cprivate\u201d practices of minorities,\nfemale genital mutilation, forced marriage, compulsory veiling, or\nbeing deprived of education may be the consequence. Okin\u2019s\ncritics countered that she falsely portrayed culture as static,\ninternally homogeneous, and defined by men\u2019s values, allowing\nliberalism to represent a culturally unmarked medium for the defense of\nindividual rights (Okin et al. 1999). For many commentators on\nmulticulturalism this is the nub of the issue: is there an\ninconsistency between defending the rights of minority cultures, while\nprohibiting those (allegedly) cultural practices that the state judges\nilliberal (Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005; Phillips 2007)? Can\nliberalism sustain the cultural and value-neutrality that some\ncommentators still ascribe to it, or to what extent should it embrace\nits own cultural specificity (Taylor 1994; Foster and Herzog 1994;\nKymlicka 1995)? Defenders of the right to cultural expression of\nminorities in multicultural states thus practice forms of identity\npolitics that are both made possible by liberalism and sometimes in\ntension with it (see Laden and Owen 2007). Increasingly it is difficult\nto see what divides anything called \u201cliberalism\u201d from\nanything called \u201cidentity politics,\u201d and some commentators\nhave suggested possible rapprochements (e.g., Laden\n2001).\n4. Contemporary Philosophical Engagement with Identity Politics\n\nSince its 1970s origins, identity politics as a mode of organizing\nand set of political philosophical positions has undergone numerous\nattacks by those motivated to point to its flaws, whether by its\npragmatic exclusions or more programmatically. For many leftist\ncommentators, in particular, identity politics is something of\na b\u00eate noire, representing the capitulation to\ncultural criticism in place of analysis of the material roots of\noppression. Marxists, both orthodox and revisionist, and\nsocialists\u2014especially those who came of age during the rise of\nthe New Left in western countries\u2014have often interpreted the\nperceived ascendancy of identity politics as representing the end of\nradical materialist critique (see discussions in McNay 2008:\n126\u2013161, and Kumar et al. 2018). Identity politics, for these\ncritics, is both factionalizing and depoliticizing, drawing attention\naway from the ravages of late capitalism toward superstructural\ncultural accommodations that leave economic structures unchanged. For\nexample, while allowing that both recognition and redistribution have a\nplace in contemporary politics, Nancy Fraser laments the supremacy of\nperspectives that take injustice to inhere in \u201ccultural\u201d\nconstructions of identity that the people to whom they are attributed\nwant to reject. Such recognition models, she argues, require remedies\nthat \u201cvalorize the group\u2019s \u2018groupness\u2019 by\nrecognizing its specificity,\u201d thus reifying identities that\nthemselves are products of oppressive structures. By contrast,\ninjustices of distribution require redistributive remedies that aim\n\u201cto put the group out of business as a group\u201d (Fraser 1997:\n19). If Fraser\u2019s argument traces its intellectual roots to Marx\nthrough critical theory, similar arguments come via Foucauldian\ngenealogy. In her 2008 book Against Recognition, for\nexample, Lois McNay argues that identity claims that are at the heart\nof many contemporary social movements are represented as demands for\nrecognition in the context of an over-simplified account of power.\nAlthough theorists of recognition typically start from a Hegelian model\nof the subject as dialogically formed and necessarily situated, they\ntoo quickly abandon the radical consequences of such a view for subject\nformation, McNay argues. The subject of recognition becomes both\npersonalized and hypostatized\u2014divorced from the larger social\nsystems of power that create conditions of possibility for particular\n\u201cidentities\u201d (2008: esp. 1\u201323). In this way, the\ndebates around subject-formation that are at the heart of philosophical\ndiscussions of identity politics parallel conversations between\nHabermasians and Foucauldians about the possibility of a transcendental\nsubject that can ground practices of critique (see Allen 2008). This\nvaried debate has a long half-life (see Fraser 2010; 2013) and\ncontemporary manifestations. For example, Glen Coulthard (2014) argues\nthat the shift in colonial state-Indigenous relations in present-day\nCanada from unabashed assimilationism to demands for mutual recognition\n(especially of cultural distinctiveness) cannot be an adequate\ndecolonization strategy. Reading the intellectual history of the\npolitics of recognition through Hegel to Sartre to Fanon to Benhabib,\nCoulthard argues that this discourse is a reiteration (and sometimes a\ncover-up) of the patriarchal, racist, and colonial relations between\nIndigenous people and the Canadian state that it purports to\nameliorate. Instead, he defends a paradigm of critical Indigenous\nresurgence that draws on cultural history and economic practices that\nare neither essentialized nor romanticized, but that also do not rest\non concession-oriented relation-building with the existing Canadian\nstate. Audra Simpson makes a similar argument, suggesting that the\npolitics of recognition in the context of settler dispossession denies\nits own history, assuming that recognition for Indigenous people can\noccur within the context of such \u201clargely state-driven\nperformance art\u201d as reconciliation, which casts the injustices of\nsettler colonialism as having occurred \u201cin the past\u201d and\nrequiring apology, rather than acknowledging the wide-ranging material\npolitical consequences of land theft and Indigenous sovereignty (2017,\n6\u20137).\n\nFrom the early days, the presentation of a dichotomy (or a choice)\nbetween recognition and redistribution, or the cultural and the\neconomic, was challenged by those who pointed out that the\nintersectional politics of gender, sexuality, and race had always been\nengaged and understood through the structures of capitalism (Butler\n1997; Upping the Anti 2005; Walters 2018). Given how many\ncontexts these debates must generalize, it is hard to see how one can\ndraw any conclusions about the merits of a thing called \u201cidentity\npolitics\u201d over and above any other kind. Nonetheless, in the\npost-2016 political world, after the Brexit referendum in the UK and\nthe election of Donald Trump in the US, as well as following the rise\nof nationalist and/or austerity right parties in many other countries,\nrecrimination from diverse political perspectives has again focused on\nthe alleged over-emphasis on \u201cidentity politics.\u201d The\ndecline of class-based politics, the growth of economic inequality, and\nthe disaffection of working-class white men, critics suggest, was\nneglected by both political party leaderships and grassroots\norganizers, in favor of campaigning around issues attaching to\nfeminism, queer politics, and anti-racism. For example, Francis\nFukuyama argues that the twentieth century was the century of the\neconomic in politics\u2014a contest between a left defined through\nworkers\u2019 rights, social welfare, and robust redistribution, and\nthe right\u2019s drive to reduce government by shrinking the public\nsector and selling publicly owned services and replacing them with\nprivate market delivery. By contrast, he suggests, the twenty-first\ncentury has seen the left focus \u201cless on creating broad economic\nequality and more on promoting the interests of a wide variety of\nmarginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, immigrants and\nrefugees, women, and LGBT people. The right, meanwhile, has redefined\nits core mission as the patriotic protection of traditional national\nidentity, which is often explicitly connected to race, ethnicity, or\nreligion\u201d (Fukuyama 2018, 91). This allegedly renders the left\nless able to address trending inequality, and redirects its focus to\n\u201ccultural issues,\u201d and validating interiority and achieving\nrecognition\u2014all of which racist nationalists can easily\nco-opt:\n\nToday, the American creedal national identity, which emerged in the\nwake of the Civil War, must be revived and defended against attacks\nfrom both the left and the right. On the right, white nationalists\nwould like to replace the creedal national identity with one based on\nrace, ethnicity, and religion. On the left, the champions of identity\npolitics have sought to undermine the legitimacy of the American\nnational story by emphasizing victimization, insinuating in some cases\nthat racism, gender discrimination, and other forms of systematic\nexclusion are in the country\u2019s DNA. (108)\n\nIdentity politics, Fukuyama concludes, is the lens through which\npolitics in the US is refracted, with a turning-away from economic\ninequality on the left providing a convenient evasion for the\nright.\n\nFukuyama writes with a hostile outsider\u2019s dismissal of the\nsocial movements he labels as identity politics, yet the bifurcation he\ndescribes between the economic and the identarian is echoed in a 2018\nspecial issue of the Marxist journal Historical Materialism,\nin which the editors\u2019 introduction describes approvingly\nsubsequent articles that show how\n\nthe Left has abrogated the notion of identity as being materially\nrooted, and contingent on historical and geographical context. In its\nplace, we see the hegemonic acceptance of an inherently reactionary\nalternative: one which perceives race, gender and sexuality as\ndearly-held, self-fashioning, and self-justifying essences. Such a\nconcession has not only reinforced the class/identity binary, but also\nled to a stifled political imagination in which identity-based politics\ncan only be conceptualised within a liberal-capitalist logic. (Kumar et\nal. 2018, 5\u20136)\n\nIn response to this challenge, defenders point out again how\npolitical organizing through contemporary feminism and\nanti-racism\u2014by way of movements like #MeToo or Black Lives\nMatter, for example\u2014has not shied away from the economic\ncomponents to their analyses. The binary between economic critique that\nmarks discussion of \u201credistribution,\u201d and discussion of\ngroup identity that characterizes \u201crecognition,\u201d may in\nmoments be conducted as if the two were separate. The idea, however,\nthat proponents of treating gender, sexuality, or race as intersecting\naxes of individual meaning and social stratification have consistently\nneglected the economic aspects of their analyses is hard to sustain. As\nSuzanna Danuta Walters points out, \u201cthe critique of identity\npolitics is dependent upon seeing identity as only the province of the\ndisenfranchised and marginal\u201d as well as upon seeing white men\n(including the working-class, straight men who are the imagined\ncommunity of the neonationalist right) as somehow not having\n\u201cidentity\u201d (Walters 2018, 477). Described by Paul Joshua as\n\u201canti-identity identity politics,\u201d this position, as\nexemplified in his description of the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d\nresponse to Black Lives Matter, \u201cis predicated on the\ntaken-for-grantedness of a pre-established racist system which from\ncenturies of de jure and de facto practices is now\nfixed almost silently into the socio-political infrastructure\u2026.\nDespite its universalist pretentions, it remains a cloaked identitarian\npolitics which through a hegemonic narrative (re)presents itself as a\nradically inclusionary counter-narrative\u201d (2019, 16).\n\nEvery time this article is revised, it is tempting to write that\n\u201cidentity politics\u201d is an out-moded term, over-determined\nby its critics and part of a reductive political lexicon on both the\nMarxist left and the neoconservative right. Yet in 2020, still, there\nare recent iterations of the recognition versus redistribution debate,\nongoing arguments about the demands of intersectionality, and new forms\nof political resistance to the movements that circulate under the sign\n\u201cidentity politics.\u201d Both flexible and extensible, identity\npolitical tropes continue to influence new political claims: an\nextensive literature approaches disability, for example, as a diverse\nand dynamic set of experiences of social injustice that sediment\nself-understandings among the disabled and motivate a politics that\ninsists dominant cultures change their exclusionary social practices\n(Davis 2017 [1997]; Silvers 1998, Siebers 2006, 2008; Kafer 2013).\nPerhaps most important for philosophers, any idea of identity itself\nappears to be in a period of rapid evolution. Attempts to decode human\ngenetics and shape the genetic make-up of future persons (Richardson\nand Stevens 2015), to clone human beings, or to xeno-transplant animal\norgans, and so on, all raise deep philosophical questions about the\nkind of thing a person is. As more and more people form political\nalliances using disembodied communications technologies, the kinds of\nidentities that matter seem also to shift. Behaviors, beliefs, and\nself-understandings are increasingly pathologized as syndromes and\ndisorders, including through the identification of new\n\u201ctypes\u201d of person (in turn generating possibilities for new\nforms of identity politics).\n\nIncreasingly, this long list of confounding variables for identity\npolitical thought is finding philosophical cohesion in anti-identarian\nmodels that take somatic life, affect, time, or space as organizing\nconcepts. For example, both new materialisms and neo-vitalist\nphilosophies, in their political contexts, share an emphasis\non becoming over being, a \u201cposthumanist\u201d\nreluctance to award ontological priority to any shared characteristics\nof human beings (Wolfe 2010), a skepticism about discourses of\nauthenticity and belonging, and a desire to focus on generative,\nforward-looking political solutions (Bhambra and Margee 2010; Coole\nand Frost 2010; Connolly 2011). The lines between humans and other\nanimals (Haraway 2007; Donaldson and Kymlicka 2014, 2016), between the\nliving and the non-living (Sharp 2011), and between objects and\nsubjects (Bennett 2009) are radically challenged. The COVID-19\npandemic shows more clearly than ever how the edges of human bodies\nare porous with our environments. To varying degrees these emphases\nare echoed in other process ontologies\u2014whether Annemarie\nMol\u2019s work in medical anthropology (2002), the reintroduction of\nbodies as socially and biologically dynamic and intra-active forces in\nforming political subjectivities (Protevi 2009), or the ways indirect,\ntechnologically mediated experience shapes so much of our contemporary\n\u201cidentities\u201d (Turkle 2011). This mass of shifts and\ncontradictions might be thought to mark the end of the era of identity\npolitics. Whatever limits are inherent to identity political\nformations, however, the enduring rhetorical power of the phrase\nitself indicates the deep implication of questions of power and\nlegitimate government with demands for self-determination that are\nunlikely to fade away.\n",
