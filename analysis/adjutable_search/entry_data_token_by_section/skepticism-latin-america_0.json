    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIt may not be a mere coincidence that in 1991 Oswaldo Porchat, a\nleading Brazilian philosopher, and in 1994 Robert J. Fogelin coined\nthe word \u201cneo-Pyrrhonism\u201d to describe their respective\nphilosophical positions. That coincidence reflects both the increasing\nsignificance of the scholarship on skepticism, in Latin American and\nin Anglo-American philosophy, and a more sympathetic attitude toward\nthis venerable tradition.\n\nTo write about skepticism in Latin America is more difficult than one\nmay expect. First, the phenomena to be described are complex and\nmultifarious. Interest in skepticism is widespread in this part of the\nworld, and by no means confined to one country or to a small group of\nphilosophers. On the one hand, the significance of skepticism in the\nphilosophy of each country seems to vary wildly; on the other, the\nhistory of studies on skepticism in each country has its own internal\ndevelopment, despite many connections among the various countries\ninvolved. Second, interest in skepticism is so recent in Latin America\nthat not enough time has elapsed to provide some perspective on the\nissue. It is perhaps still too soon to give an entirely balanced view\nof skepticism in the region. But we will attempt our best to achieve\nthat.\n\nAn interesting feature of the Latin American way of approaching\nskepticism is by not taking it just as the embodiment of an opponent\nto be refuted. At the very least, there is not a widespread prejudice\nagainst skepticism. On the contrary, many Latin American philosophers\nhave strong sympathy for the skeptical proposal, and even those who\nare not skeptics themselves do not think that if the assumption of a\nphilosophical thesis leads to skepticism, this constitutes a kind of\nreductio ad absurdum of the initial assumption. Skepticism\nis, for many Latin American philosophers, at least a prima\nfacie tenable position. That does not mean, of course, that the\nmajority of those Latin American philosophers who deal with skepticism\nare skeptics, but we do find many that consider themselves as such.\nEven for those who are not skeptics, the significance of philosophical\nskepticism is undeniable, and Latin American philosophers have made\nefforts to understand carefully its meaning and historical role.\n\nThe best way to introduce skepticism in Latin America is not to\nexplain what goes on in each country, but to report what Latin\nAmerican philosophers have said concerning those topics that caught\ntheir attention. However, we will begin by presenting a brief\nhistorical background and the thought of the two founding fathers of\nLatin American work on skepticism: Oswaldo Porchat (Brazil) and\nEzequiel de Olaso (Argentina). Special care must be taken with their\nwork, because together they set the stage for a proper understanding\nof what happens in all other Latin American countries. We will then\nexamine what Latin American philosophers have been doing both in\ncontemporary skepticism and in the history of this philosophical\ntradition. Ours is not an exhaustive account, and being selective, it\nis unable to accommodate every proposal in the field. We hope,\nhowever, to give a fair idea of what has happened and is currently\ntaking place, in order to situate the reader and prompt additional\nresearch in the area.\n",
