    "main_text": "Ancient Sources and the Nature of the Evidence\n2. Ancient Sources and the Nature of the Evidence\n\nWith the exception of poetry allegedly written while on\nAlexander\u2019s expedition (which, as far as we can tell, did not\nsurvive that expedition), Pyrrho wrote nothing; we are therefore\nobliged to try to reconstruct his philosophy from reports by others.\nUnfortunately the reports that we have are fragmentary and, in many\ncases, of doubtful reliability. Pyrrho\u2019s follower Timon wrote\nnumerous poems and prose works; but of these only fragments and in\nsome cases second-hand reports survive. It is likely that much of what\nwe hear about Pyrrho in later sources also derives indirectly from\nTimon, but it is frequently not possible to judge, in individual\ncases, whether or not this is so. Other difficulties concerning\nTimon\u2019s evidence are, first, that he writes as a devotee rather\nthan as a neutral reporter, and second, that the great majority of\nTimon\u2019s fragments derive from a poem called Silloi\n(Lampoons), and consist of satirical thumbnail sketches of\nother philosophers rather than any kind of direct exposition of\nPyrrho\u2019s outlook. (See the entry on Timon, section 2, for\ndetails.) Nevertheless, Timon is clearly the most important and\nthe most trustworthy source of information about Pyrrho. Of the\nevidence from Timon, one piece looks to be especially important.\nThis is a summary, by the Peripatetic Aristocles of Messene (late 1st\nc. BCE), of an account by Timon of what appear to\nbe Pyrrho\u2019s most general philosophical attitudes. It is\nwidely agreed that this passage must be the centerpiece of any\ninterpretation of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy. However, its usefulness\nfor this purpose depends in part on how much of it is actually talking\nabout Pyrrho\u2019s attitudes, as opposed to Timon\u2019s own\ndevelopments or expansions of them. As we shall see, this is one of\nmany difficulties in interpreting the passage.\n\nWith the exception of a very few snippets of information, the only\nother source of evidence on Pyrrho that is close to contemporary is\nAntigonus of Carystus, a biographer of the mid-third century BCE.\nDiogenes Laertius, whose life of Pyrrho is our major source of\nbiographical anecdotes, frequently cites Antigonus, and is probably\nindebted to him in many places even when he does not cite him;\nAntigonus is also mentioned by Aristocles, and is likely to be the\norigin of much or even most of the surviving biographical material on\nPyrrho. But Antigonus needs to be handled even more carefully than\nTimon. He was not a philosopher, and there is no reason to think that\nhe was capable of or particularly interested in comprehending\nphilosophical nuances. Nor is it clear that accuracy was high on his\nlist of priorities; on the contrary, what we know about him suggests\nthat he was a purveyor of sensationalist gossip rather than a reliable\nhistorian. His account probably did contain genuine information about\nPyrrho\u2019s demeanor and activities; but it would certainly be\nunwise to take his anecdotes as a group on trust.\n\nCicero refers to Pyrrho about ten times, and Cicero is, in general, a\nresponsible reporter of other people\u2019s views. Unfortunately his\ninformation about Pyrrho appears to be very incomplete, and, as we\nshall see, the impression he conveys of him may very well be\ninaccurate. With one exception, he never mentions him except in\nconjunction with the famously non-orthodox Stoics Aristo and\n(sometimes) Herillus, and the remarks in question always concern the\nsame one or two points in ethics; it looks as if his knowledge of\nPyrrho derives almost entirely from a single source that conveyed\nlittle or nothing about Pyrrho individually. In addition, a number of\nauthors in later antiquity make isolated comments about Pyrrho. But\nsince these comments postdate the rise of the later Pyrrhonist\nmovement, there is often room for suspicion as to whether they reflect\ngenuine information about Pyrrho himself, as opposed to the later\nphilosophy that took his name.\n\nEven given the difficulty referred to above, any attempt to interpret\nPyrrho\u2019s philosophy must pay close attention to the summary of\nTimon in Aristocles. If the entire passage is summarizing the\nviews of Pyrrho (as Timon understood them), it clearly takes\nprecedence, in detail and trustworthiness, over the remaining\nevidence \u2014 pace Green (2017), who proposes a more holistic\napproach. If, on the other hand, much of the passage conveys the views\nof Timon, and only part of it the views of Pyrrho, the holistic\napproach has more to recommend it, despite the paucity of the\nremaining evidence. Even on this assumption, however, the Aristocles\npassage remains as important as anything else, and to this we now\nturn.\n",
