    "main_text": "Aristotle || Claims to Rule\n4.3 Claims to Rule\n\nThe Politics begins by setting the stage for the first kind\nof understanding of constitutions identified above, by offering an\nanalysis of the teleological ends of life and the human capacity for\nspeech which together support its two most famous contentions: that\n\u201cit is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that\nman is by nature a political animal\u201d (I.2, 1253a2\u20133). (Hu\n2020 discusses the naturalness of the polis.) While for some\nmodern readers this sentence asserts that political participation is\nnecessary for virtuous human flourishing (as for Irwin 1990), others\ncontend that \u201cthe argument that man is a political animal does\nnot imply that man must participate in politics to become virtuous,\nonly that he must literally be a part of a polis and live\nunder its laws.\u201d (Mulgan 1990:\n 205)[10]\n In either case, as Hannah Arendt (1958) emphasizes, Aristotle\u2019s\nunderstanding of civic unity insists on respect for human plurality as\nthe condition of political action; in Book II, he criticizes\nPlato\u2019s kallipolis (the beautiful city for which a\nconstitution is sketched in the Republic) for interpreting\nthe requirement of civic unity in so extreme a fashion as to have\nobliterated the properly political domain altogether (Nussbaum 1980).\nNevertheless, civic unity is still an aim of Aristotle\u2019s ideal\nvirtuous regime, and a limited Platonic spirit survives in the common\nmeals that this regime would offer to all citizens: VII.10. \n\nIf \u201cman is by nature a political animal,\u201d how can it be\njust to exclude some human beings from a full share, and in some cases\nfrom any share, in political life? Aristotle recognizes that this\nquestion must be confronted, and he acknowledges some unnamed thinkers\nwho had answered that it is indeed unjust. For these unnamed figures,\nslavery is not merely a conventional arrangement (rather than a\nnatural one); it is a conventional arrangement which is contrary to\nwhat is natural, and this is why it should be counted as unjust. As\nAristotle describes their view: \u201cOthers affirm that the rule of\na master over slaves is contrary to nature [literally: \u2018against\nnature\u2019 (para phusin)], and that the distinction\nbetween slave and freeman exists by convention [nom\u014d,\ndative] only, and not by nature [phusei]; and being an\ninterference with nature is therefore unjust [not dikaion]:\nfor it is force [biaion]\u201d (I.4,\n1253b20\u201323). Aristotle blocks the inference that any\nrelationship of slavery is contrary to nature and therefore unjust, by\narguing that there are or could be grounds for a kind of slavery that\nis indeed consonant with nature: namely, he claims, enslavement of\nthose whose practical reason is incapable of fully ruling their own\nactions. He contends that the person who is by nature a slave\n\u201chas no deliberative faculty at all; the woman has, but it is\nwithout authority, and the child has, but it is immature\u201d (I.13,\n1260a12\u201314) (on interpretation of this passage in light of\nAristotle\u2019s biological works, Karbowski 2012; for an argument\nthat Aristotelian natures are made through habituation, Frank 2005).\nThis does not imply that any or all actually enslaved persons are\nnatural slaves, though Aristotle in the same chapter and elsewhere\nremarks on \u201cbarbarians,\u201d especially peoples who live in\ncertain climates, as fitted for slavery (Kraut 2002:\n290\u201395). Some of the pernicious afterlives of this view and of\nthe Aristotelian account of natural slavery more generally in later\ndefenses of slavery are recounted in Huxley 1980 and Monoson 2011. On\nmany interpretations, the view also leads to some tension in\nspecifying the function of slavery as an institution, since that\ninstitution presupposes that the slave can understand and follow the\nmaster\u2019s commands, which would seem to require some degree of\ndeliberative capacity even on Aristotle\u2019s own terms. The\nexclusion of some human beings from a share in political life and\ntheir subjection to the domination and exploitation of a relationship\nof enslavement shadows Aristotle\u2019s exploration of the value of\nthe life of politics for realizing human nature.\n\nElsewhere in the Politics, the Greek dictum of citizenship\namong equals\u2014that \u201ca citizen is one who shares in\ngoverning and being governed\u201d (III.13, 1283b42\u20131284a1,\nalso translatable as \u201cruling and being ruled in\nturn\u201d)\u2014is presented as an analytical truth, leaving open\nhow such equality is to be conceived in practice (and again,\nconsistent in the logic of the argument with the potential exclusion\nof some from the domain of equality altogether). The citizen\n\u201cshares in the administration of justice, and in offices\u201d\n(III.1, 1275a23\u201324). In defective regimes, the good citizen and\nthe good man may come apart.  The good citizen of a defective regime\nis one whose character suits the particular regime in question\n(whether oligarchic, or democratic, say) and equips him to support it\nloyally; hence he may be deformed or stunted by a role of holding (or\na role of holding accountable) offices defined on incorrect terms. In\n\u201cthe best state,\u201d however, the citizen is \u201cone who\nis able and chooses to be governed and to govern with a view to the\nlife of excellence\u201d (III.13, 1284a1\u20133). In such a state,\n\u201cthe citizens must not lead the life of artisans or tradesmen,\nfor such a life is ignoble and inimical to excellence\u201d (VII.9,\n1328b39\u201341), nor that of farmers, as political participation\nrequires leisure. Here the limitations and exclusions among actual\nhumans licensed by the principled formulation of the\npossibility\u2014requiring actual realization\u2014of human virtue\nbecome apparent.\n\nAristotle recognizes that there are other possible claims, or as it\nwere titles, to political rule: \u201cThere is also a doubt as to\nwhat is to be the supreme power in the state:\u2014Is it the\nmultitude? Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one best man? Or a\ntyrant?\u201d (III.10, 1281a11\u201313). He develops in particular\ndetail the arguments that might be made on behalf of the many and the\nknowledgeable one respectively. The many can judge, as they did in\nAthenian dramatic audiences, juries, and the Assembly (where they\n\u201cjudged\u201d, by voting on, the merits of something advanced\nfor their consideration, whether a play, an indictment, or a\nspeaker\u2019s proposed resolution). Aristotle uses the image of a\ncollectively provided feast to illustrate the potential superiority of\nsuch collective judgement; how to interpret this image (whether as a\npotluck, Waldron 1995, Wilson 2011, Ober 2013, or in a more\naggregative way, Bouchard 2011, Cammack 2013, Lane 2013a, Hatzistavrou\n2021) and other images that he uses is a matter of some renewed\ncontroversy (for a review, see Bobonich 2015). But the lesson\nAristotle draws from the various images is clearly limited to\nvindicating a role of the many in electing and holding accountable\nincumbents of the highest offices rather than in holding such offices\nthemselves (III.11, 1281b31; Lane 2013a). The many can contribute to\nvirtuous decision-making in their collective capacity of\njudgment\u2014presumably in assemblies and juries\u2014but not as\nindividual high officials (Lane 2013a, 2014b, Poddighe 2014).\n\nIn the contrasting case of the one supremely excellent person,\nAristotle argues that such a person has, strictly speaking, no equals,\nand so cannot be made justly to take a turn in rule, holding office\nfor a time, as one citizen among others. Instead it is right that such\na person should rule without the term limits that political office\nwould ordinarily require:\n\nIf, however, there be some one person, or more than one, although not\nenough to make up the full complement of a state, whose excellence is\nso pre-eminent that the excellence or the political capacity of all\nthe rest admit of no comparison with his or theirs, he or they can be\nno longer regarded as part of a state; for justice will not be done to\nthe superior, if he is reckoned only as the equal of those who are so\nfar inferior to him in excellence and in political capacity. Such a\nman may truly be deemed a god among men \u2026.men like him should\nbe kings in their state for life. (III.13,\n1284a3\u201311\u20261284b32\u201334; cf. III.17, 1288a24\u201329)\n\n\nOn one reading, this implies that virtuous monarchy does indeed count\nas a political regime, albeit one in which only one or a few of the\ncitizens are eligible to hold the highest offices (Riesbeck 2014). Yet\nthis argument is left at the hypothetical level. In the absence of\nsuch a superlatively virtuous, even godlike individual, the\nformulation of political rule as involving some kind of turn-taking by\na large body of sufficiently virtuous citizens remains preeminent\n(though even this should not be read to imply that all should in fact\nalternate in office, or even that all should necessarily be eligible\nfor all offices).\n\nAs Aristotle turn to consideration of the best constitutions relative\nto particular (and imperfect) circumstances, the major issue is\nconflict between rival factions over the basis for defining equality\nand so justice. In the Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Aristotle\nhad identified two types of equality: geometrical, or proportional to\nmerit; and arithmetical, or proportional to mere numerical counting.\nIn Politics III.9 he picks up this distinction and aligns it\nwith the conflict between oligarchical and democratic justice. As he\nlater puts it, \u201cDemocrats say that justice is that to which the\nmajority agree, oligarchs that to which the wealthier class\nagree\u2026\u201d (VI.3, 1318a18\u201320), while truly\naristocratic justice would enfranchise only those equal in virtue.\nThis attention to the actual political contentions of rival Greek\ngroups leads into a discussion of the relative goodness and badness of\nimperfect regimes, modeled in part on Plato\u2019s\nStatesman. Whereas that Platonic text had distinguished\nmonarchy from tyranny, aristocracy from oligarchy, and good from bad\ndemocracy on the basis of obedience to law (all these regimes being\nconceived as lacking the genuine political knowledge of the true\nstatesman), Aristotle instead makes the dividing line the question of\nruling for the common advantage as opposed to ruling for the advantage\nof a single faction. The \u201cbad\u201d democracy, for example,\nrules for the faction of the many as opposed to the faction of the\nfew, whereas the \u201cgood\u201d democracy\u2014which Aristotle\nbaptizes \u201cpolity\u201d, using the general word for\n\u201cconstitution\u201d (politeia)\u2014rules for the\nadvantage of all citizens. Aristotle augments this analysis with\nappeals to historical narrative, overlapping with the narrative of\nAthenian political history offered in the Constitution of\nAthens compiled by him or, more likely, by members of his school.\nOn his telling in the Politics, Athenian democracy had\ndegenerated from an aboriginal democracy of non-meddling farmers\n(VI.4), through various intermediate forms, to a democracy (seemingly\nthat of contemporary fourth-century Athens) in which men rule, not\nlaws. Yet this trajectory does not prevent him from asserting that in\ngeneral democracy is \u201cmost tolerable\u201d of the three\nperversions (IV.2, 1289b4\u20135) and noting that it at least\ninvolves the characteristic political liberty of ruling and being\nruled in turn (VI.2).\n\nA further major turn in the analysis comes when the question of some\nsingle \u201cbest\u201d regime is replaced by a question about not\nwhat is \u201cbest\u201d in the \u201cideal\u201d sense, but the\ngood constitution \u201cthat is easily attainable by all\u201d\n(IV.1, 1288a37\u201339) and in practice best for most cities (IV.11).\nThis Aristotle calls the middling regime: a political, because\nsociological, mean between oligarchy and democracy, in which the\nmiddle classes hold the preponderance of both wealth distribution and\npolitical power. Thus it is attainable through reform of either an\noligarchy or a democracy, the most prevalent constitutions among the\nGreeks. Strikingly, his example of such a regime is Sparta: presented\nas a case of a characteristically democratic distribution of education\n(among citizens only, of course) coupled with the characteristically\naristocratic principle of election to offices rather than selection by\nlot (IV.9) (though to be sure, democracies such as Athens made use of\nelection for certain of the highest offices as well).\n",
