    "main_text": "A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism || The Consent Theory of Political Authority: The Natural Right to Freedom Argument\n4.1 The Consent Theory of Political Authority: The Natural Right to Freedom Argument\n\n\nThe consent theory of political authority states only a necessary\ncondition of the legitimacy of political authority. It states that a\npolitical authority is legitimate only if it has the consent of those\nwho are subject to its commands. Many have argued that in addition to\nconsent, a state must be minimally just for it to be legitimate (Locke\n1990).\n\n\nA number of arguments have been presented in favor of this view.\nLocke's argument is that each person has an equal natural right to\nfreedom and that this implies that at the age of maturity no one may be\nsubordinated to anyone else's commands by nature (Locke 1990). Let us\ncall this the natural right argument. Such subordination would\nviolate the equal freedom of the subordinated person. To the extent\nthat political authority involves issuing commands and requiring others\nto follow the commands, it seems to involve subordinating one person to\nthe commands of another and thus violates the natural right to freedom\nof the subordinated person.\n",
