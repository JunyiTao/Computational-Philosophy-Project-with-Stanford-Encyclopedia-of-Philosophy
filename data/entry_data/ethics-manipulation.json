    "preamble": "\n\nConsider this case: Tonya plans to do Y, but Irving wants her\nto do X instead. Irving has tried unsuccessfully to provide\nTonya with reasons for doing X rather than Y. If\nIrving is unwilling to resort to coercion or force, he might deploy\nany of the following tactics to try to influence Tonya\u2019s choice.\nFor example, Irving might \u2026\n\nCharm Tonya into wanting to please Irving by doing\nX.\nExaggerate the advantages of doing X and the\ndisadvantages of doing Y, and/or understate the disadvantages\nof doing X and the advantages of doing Y.\nMake Tonya feel guilty for preferring to do Y.\nInduce Tonya into an emotional state that makes doing X\nseem more appropriate than it really is.\nPoint out that doing Y will make Tonya seem less worthy\nand appealing to her friends.\nMake Tonya feel badly about herself and portray Y as a\nchoice that will confirm or exacerbate this feeling, and/or portray\nX as a choice that will disconfirm or combat it.\nDo a small favor for Tonya before asking her to do X, so\nthat she feels obligated to comply.\nMake Tonya doubt her own judgment so that she will\nrely on Irving\u2019s advice to do X.\nMake it clear to Tonya that if she does Y\nrather than X, Irving will withdraw his friendship, sulk, or\nbecome irritable and generally unpleasant.\nFocus Tonya\u2019s attention on some aspect of doing Y\nthat Tonya fears and ramp up that fear to get her to change her mind\nabout doing Y.\n\n\nEach of these tactics could reasonably be called manipulation. Many\nalso have more specific, commonplace names, such as \u201cguilt\ntrip\u201d (tactic 3), \u201cgaslighting\u201d (tactic 8),\n\u201cpeer pressure\u201d (tactic 5), \u201cnegging\u201d (tactic\n6), and \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d (tactic 9). Perhaps not\neveryone will agree that every tactic on this list is\nproperly described as manipulation. And in some cases, whether the\ntactic seems manipulative may depend on various details not specified\nin the case as described. For example, if Y is seriously\nimmoral, then perhaps it is not manipulative for Irving to induce\nTonya to feel guilty about planning to do Y. It is also\npossible that we might revise our judgments about some of these\ntactics in light of a fully worked out and well supported theory of\nmanipulation\u2014if we had one. Nevertheless, this list should\nprovide a reasonably good sense of what we mean by\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d in ordinary discourse. It should also serve\nto illustrate the wide variety of tactics commonly described as\nmanipulation.\n\nManipulation is often characterized as a form of influence that is\nneither coercion nor rational persuasion. But this characterization\nimmediately raises the question: Is every form of influence\nthat is neither coercion nor rational persuasion a form of\nmanipulation? If manipulation does not occupy the entire logical space\nof influences that are neither rational persuasion nor coercion, then\nwhat distinguishes it from other forms of influence that are neither\ncoercion nor rational persuasion?\n\nThe term \u201cmanipulation\u201d is commonly thought to include an\nelement of moral disapprobation: To say that Irving manipulated Tonya\nis commonly taken to be a moral criticism of Irving\u2019s behavior.\nIs manipulation always immoral? Why is manipulation immoral\n(when it is immoral)? If manipulation is not always immoral, then what\ndetermines when it is immoral?\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1 Ordinary versus Global Manipulation\n\nForms of influence like those listed above are commonplace in ordinary\nlife. This distinguishes them from forms of influence described as\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d in the free will literature. There, the\nterm \u201cmanipulation\u201d typically refers to radical\nprogramming or reprogramming of all or most of an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs, desires, and other mental states. Such global manipulation\n(as we might call it) is also typically imagined as happening via\ndecidedly extra-ordinary methods, such as supernatural intervention,\ndirect neurological engineering, or radical programs of indoctrination\nand psychological conditioning. Global manipulation is typically\nthought to deprive its victim of free will. This common intuition\ndrives the \u201cmanipulation argument\u201d, which seeks to defend\nincompatibilism by claiming that living in a deterministic universe is\nanalogous to having been the victim of global manipulation. (For a\ndetailed discussion of this argument, see the discussion of\nmanipulation arguments in the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism.)\n\nDespite the differences between what we might call \u201cordinary\nmanipulation\u201d and the forms of manipulation in the free will\nliterature, it is still worth wondering about the relationship between\nthem. If global manipulation completely deprives its victim of free\nwill or autonomy, might more ordinary forms of manipulation do\nsomething similar, but on a more limited scale? If Tonya succumbs to\none of Irving\u2019s tactics, should we regard her as being less\nfree\u2014and perhaps less responsible\u2014for doing X? So\nfar, few people have explored the connections between ordinary\nmanipulation and the forms of global manipulation discussed in the\nfree will literature. (Two exceptions are Long 2014 and Todd\n2013).\n1.2 Applications of a Theory of Ordinary Manipulation\n\nUntil recently, ordinary manipulation has seldom been the subject of\nphilosophical inquiry in its own right. However, the fact that it is\ncommonly thought to undermine the validity of consent has led to its\nfrequent mention in areas where the validity of consent is at\nissue.\n\nOne such area is medical ethics, where proposed conditions for\nautonomous informed consent often reference the need to ensure that\nconsent is not manipulated. In fact, one of the earliest sustained\nphilosophical discussions of manipulation appears in Ruth Faden, Tom\nBeauchamp, and Nancy King\u2019s influential book, A History and\nTheory of Informed Consent (1986). The view that manipulation\nundermines the validity of consent is widely held among medical\nethicists. However, there is far less agreement about how to determine\nwhether a given form of influence is manipulative. Nowhere is this\nlack of agreement more apparent than in recent discussions of\n\u201cnudges\u201d.\n\nThe concept of a nudge was introduced by Cass Sunstein and Richard\nThaler to refer to the deliberate introduction of subtle, non-coercive\ninfluences into people\u2019s decision-making to get them to make\nmore optimal choices (Thaler & Sunstein 2009; Sunstein 2014). Some\nnudges merely provide better and more comprehensible information;\nthese nudges might seem best characterized as influences that improve\nthe quality of rational deliberation. However, even with\n\u201cpurely\u201d informational nudges, one might worry that the\nselection of which information is presented could be\nmanipulative; perhaps providing nutrition information on food\npackaging nudges people to make food choices based on health\nconsiderations rather than taste, for instance. More pressing concerns\narise with nudges that operate by psychological mechanisms whose\nrelationship to rational deliberation is questionable at\nbest. Many of these nudges exploit heuristics, reasoning and\ndecision-making biases, and other psychological processes that operate\noutside of conscious awareness. For example, some evidence suggests\nthat patients are more likely to choose an operation if they are told\nthat it has a 90% survival rate rather than a 10% fatality rate. Would\nit be manipulative for a surgeon to exploit this framing effect to\nnudge the patient into making the decision that the surgeon thinks\nbest? Is it manipulative for a cafeteria manager to place healthier\nfood items at eye level to nudge customers into choosing them? The\nquestion of whether and when nudges manipulate has sparked a lively\ndebate.\n\nSome defenders of nudges suggest that because it is often impossible\nto frame a decision without pointing the decision-maker in\nsome direction, there is nothing manipulative about framing\nsuch decisions in one way rather than another. For example, physicians\nmust provide outcome information either in terms of fatality rate or\nsurvival rate (and if they give both, they must give one first), and\ncafeteria managers must choose something to put at eye level in the\ndisplays. This being the case, why think that deliberately choosing\none way of framing the decision over another is manipulative? Some\ndefenders of nudges suggest that in cases where it is inevitable to\nintroduce a non-rational influence into decision-making, deliberately\ndoing so is not manipulative. But there are reasons to be wary of this\nline of thought. Suppose that Jones is traveling to a job interview on\na subway car so crowded that it is inevitable that he will bump up\nagainst his fellow passengers. Suppose that he capitalizes on this\nfact to deliberately bump his rival job candidate (who is on the same\nsubway car) out the door just as it closes, thus ensuring that he will\nbe late for his interview. Clearly the fact that it was inevitable\nthat Jones\u2019s rival would be subjected to some bumping\ndoes not excuse Jones for intentionally bumping his rival out the\ndoor. Similarly, even if we inevitably introduce non-rational\ninfluences into each other\u2019s decision-making, that fact seems\ninsufficient to prove that such influences can never be manipulative.\nNo doubt this analogy is imperfect, but it should suffice to call into\nquestion the assumption that a deliberate nudge is not manipulative\nsimply because some nudging is inevitable. (For a similar argument,\nsee Douglass 2022.)\n\nMore nuanced discussions of whether nudges manipulate tend to focus\nless on the inevitability of nudging in some direction or another, and\nmore on the mechanisms by which the nudging occurs, and the direction\nin which it pushes the person being nudged. Although there is wide\nagreement that some nudges can be manipulative, so far no consensus\nhas emerged about which nudges are manipulative or how to distinguish\nmanipulative from non-manipulative nudges. (For a sample of approaches\nto the question of whether and when nudges manipulate, see\nBlumenthal-Barby 2012; Blumenthal-Barby & Burroughs 2012; Saghai\n2013; Wilkinson 2013; Hanna 2015; Moles 2015; and Nys & Engelen\n2017. For arguments that nudges can be sometimes morally justified\neven when they are manipulative, see Wilkinson 2017 and Nys &\nEngelen 2017).\n\nQuestions about the legitimacy of nudges go beyond the medical\ncontext. Thaler and Sunstein advocate their use by government,\nemployers, and other institutions besides the health care industry.\nThe use of nudges by government raises additional concerns, especially\nabout the paternalism behind them (Arneson 2015; White 2013).\nQuestions about other forms of manipulation in the political sphere\nhave also been raised by philosophers and political theorists. The\nidea that political leaders might gain, retain, or consolidate\npolitical power by means that we would now call manipulative can be\ntraced back at least as far back as ancient Greek figures like\nCallicles and Thrasymachus. Niccolo Machiavelli not only details but\nrecommends political tactics that we would likely regard as\nmanipulative. More recent philosophical work on political manipulation\nincludes Robert Goodin\u2019s 1980 book on Manipulatory\nPolitics and Claudia Mills\u2019s important paper,\n\u201cPolitics and Manipulation\u201d (1995), as well as Dowding\n(2016), Riker (1986), Ware (1981), Gorton (2016), Whitfield (2020),\nand the papers collected in (Le Cheminant and Parrish 2011); for an\noverview of this literature, see Noggle (2021).\n\nIn the field of business ethics, much philosophical attention has been\nfocused on the question of whether advertising is manipulative. The\neconomist John Kenneth Galbraith famously called advertising\n\u201cthe manipulation of consumer desire\u201d and compared being\nthe target of advertising with being\n\n\nassailed by demons which instilled in him a passion sometimes for silk\nshirts, sometimes for kitchenware, sometimes for chamber pots, and\nsometimes for orange squash. (Galbraith 1958)\n\n\nSeveral philosophers have made similar criticisms of advertising.\nOften, these criticisms are limited to forms of advertising that do\nnot simply convey accurate factual information. As is the case with\npurely informational nudges, the presentation of accurate information\nin advertising might not be manipulative in and of itself, though\nperhaps the selection of which information is presented might be\nmanipulative. Be that as it may, most advertising attempts to\ninfluence consumer behavior by means other than or in addition to\npurely providing accurate information. Such non-informational\nadvertising is the most apt target for worries about manipulation. Tom\nBeauchamp and Roger Crisp have made influential arguments that such\nadvertising can be manipulative (Beauchamp 1984; Crisp 1987). Similar\ncriticisms claim that non-informational advertising can subvert\nautonomy or improperly tamper with consumers\u2019 desires (e.g.,\nSantilli 1983). Such critiques are either versions of or close\nrelatives to critiques of advertising as manipulation. On the other\nside, Robert Arrington argues that, as a matter of fact, advertising\nvery seldom manipulates its audience or undermines its\naudience\u2019s autonomy (Arrington 1982). Michael Phillips has\nmarshalled a large body of empirical evidence to argue that while some\nadvertising is manipulative, its critics vastly overestimate its power\nto influence consumers (Phillips 1997).\n1.3 Two Questions about Manipulation\n\nAs will be apparent from our discussion so far, two main questions\nneed to be answered by any satisfactory theory of manipulation.\n\nOne question\u2014call it the identification\nquestion\u2014concerns definition and identification: How can we\nidentify which forms of influence are manipulative and which are not?\nA satisfactory answer would presumably involve a general definition of\nmanipulation, which explains what the diverse forms of manipulative\ninfluence have in common. In addition to illuminating how the various\ninstances of manipulation are manifestations of a single more basic\nphenomenon, an answer to the identification question should also\nprovide criteria for determining whether a given instance of influence\nis manipulative. Such an analysis might, of course, show that some of\nthe phenomena that we were pre-theoretically inclined to count as\nmanipulation are relevantly different from clear cases of\nmanipulation, so that we might be led to revise our usage of the term\n\u201cmanipulation.\u201d\n\nA second question\u2014call it the evaluation\nquestion\u2014concerns morality: How should we evaluate the\nmoral status of manipulation? A satisfactory answer to this question\nshould tell us whether manipulation is always immoral. And if\nmanipulation is not always immoral, it should tell us how to determine\nwhen manipulation is immoral. But more importantly, a\nsatisfactory answer to the evaluation question should explain\nwhy manipulation is immoral when it is immoral. What feature\nof manipulation makes it immoral in those situations when it is\nimmoral?\n\nAlthough the identification and evaluation questions are distinct,\nthey are not entirely independent. Any analysis of why manipulation is\nimmoral (when it is immoral) will presuppose some account of what\nmanipulation is. Thus, our answer to the identification question will\nconstrain our answer to the evaluation question. But an answer to the\nidentification question might do more than constrain our\nanswer to the evaluation question: it might also guide it. If\nan account of manipulation identifies its underlying characteristic as\nbeing relevantly similar to some other thing that we have independent\ngrounds for regarding as morally wrong, then we would likely want to\nargue that manipulation is wrong for similar reasons. Finally, we\nmight need to adjust our answers to one or both questions if they\ntogether imply implausible consequences. For example, if we define\nmanipulation as every form of influence besides rational persuasion or\ncoercion, and then claim that the wrongness of manipulation is\nabsolute, we will be forced to conclude that no form of influence\nbesides rational persuasion is ever morally legitimate. This is a\nradical conclusion that few would be willing to accept, but it is a\nconclusion that results from combining a certain answer to the\nidentification question with a certain answer to the evaluation\nquestion.\n2. Answering the Identification Question\n\nA number of accounts of manipulation have been put forward. They can\nbe grouped roughly into three main categories: those that characterize\nmanipulation as an influence that bypasses reason; those that treat it\nas a form of trickery, and those that treat it as a form of pressure.\nThese are rough categories, and a single theory might fit into more\nthan one of them. But they are useful groupings nonetheless.\n2.1 Manipulation as Bypassing Reason\n\nManipulation is often said to \u201cbypass\u201d the target\u2019s\nrational deliberation. It is not always clear, however, whether this\nclaim is meant as a definition of manipulation or merely as a\nstatement about manipulation (perhaps one that partly explains its\nmoral status). But let us consider whether the idea that manipulation\nbypasses reason can serve as a definition of manipulation.\n\nThe thought that manipulative influences bypass the target\u2019s\ncapacity for rational deliberation is appealing for at least two\nreasons. First, it seems reasonable to think that because manipulation\ndiffers from rational persuasion, it must influence behavior by means\nthat do not engage the target\u2019s rational capacities. Second, it\nseems intuitive to describe forms of influence that do clearly bypass\nthe target\u2019s capacity for rational deliberation as manipulative.\nFor example, suppose that subliminal advertising worked in the way\nthat it is commonly\u2014though probably\ninaccurately\u2014portrayed, so that being exposed to a subliminal\nmessage urging you to \u201cDrink Coke\u201d could influence your\nbehavior without engaging your mechanisms of rational deliberation.\nIntuitively such an influence would seem to be a clear case of\nmanipulation.\n\nSubliminal advertising tactics\u2014along with hypnosis and\nbehavioral conditioning\u2014are commonly portrayed as effective\nmethods to influence others without their knowledge and thus without\nengaging their capacities for rational deliberation. The effectiveness\nof such tactics is almost certainly wildly exaggerated in the popular\n(and sometimes philosophical) imagination. However, if we imagine them\nworking as well as they are sometimes portrayed, then they would\nconstitute clear examples of what it might mean to say that\nmanipulation bypasses reason. Thus, we might understand manipulation\nin terms of bypassing rational deliberation, and understand\n\u201cbypassing rational deliberation\u201d in terms of exploiting\npsychological mechanisms or techniques that can generate behavior\nwithout any input from rational deliberation.\n\nAnother way that manipulation might bypass rational deliberation would\nbe for it to appeal to non-conscious motivations. Eric Cave explores\nthis idea in a pair of papers (Cave 2007, 2014) on what he calls\n\u201cmotive manipulation.\u201d Cave distinguishes between\n\u201cconcerns,\u201d which are conscious pro-attitudes, and\nunconscious \u201cnon-concern motives.\u201d He then defines motive\nmanipulation as influence that operates by engaging unconscious\nnon-concern motives. This theory clearly implies that appeals to\nnon-conscious motives, as well as influences that operate via\n\u201cquasi-hypnotic techniques\u201d and \u201ccrude behavioral\nconditioning\u201d are manipulative (Cave 2014: 188). Although Cave\nhimself does not claim that all forms of manipulation are of this sort\n(Cave 2007: 130), would such a claim be plausible? Or could we add the\nappeal to non-conscious motives to the list of psychological\nmechanisms that bypass reason, and define manipulation in terms of\nexploiting such mechanisms?\n\nUnfortunately, this approach faces a serious problem. If we define\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing rational deliberation, and then use\nthe appeal to unconscious motives and exaggerated portrayals of\nhypnosis and subliminal advertising to illustrate what it means to\nbypass rational deliberation, we will set a very high bar for\nsomething to count as manipulation. This bar would be too high to\ncount any of Irving\u2019s tactics as manipulation, since none of\nthem completely bypasses Tonya\u2019s capacity for rational\ndeliberation in the way that subliminal advertising, hypnosis,\nconditioning, or the appeal to unconscious motives would appear to\ndo.\n\nPerhaps a more promising account of what it might mean for\nmanipulation to bypass reason would construe manipulation as an\ninfluence that is covert in a way that allows it to bypass reason.\nCertainly, if an influence is covert and thus escapes one\u2019s\nnotice, then it would also seem to escape any conscious reasoning\nprocess. An early version of the idea that manipulation is best\ncharacterized as covert influence was suggested by the political\ntheorist Alan Ware (1981). Ware characterizes manipulation as an\ninfluence on the target which is covert in the sense that the target\nlacks knowledge or understanding of how she is being influenced.\n\nA more recent version of this view was put forward by Daniel Susser,\nBeate Roessler, and Helen Nissenbaum, who write that:\n\u201cmanipulation is hidden influence. \u2026 Covertly influencing\nsomeone\u2014imposing a hidden influence\u2014means influencing them\nin a way they aren\u2019t consciously aware of, and in a way they\ncouldn\u2019t easily become aware of\u201d (Susser et al., 2019: 4).\nAlan Strudler suggests that \u201ca sufficient even though not\nexhaustive characterization of manipulation\u201d is that it involves\nchanging a person\u2019s behavior \u201cthrough a chain of events\nthat has the desired effect only because the person is unaware of that\nchain\u201d (Strudler 2005: 459).\n\nThis sort of view works well with influences like subliminal\nadvertising. But it would also appear to apply to other sorts of\npsychological influences that bypass conscious attention, such as\npriming effects and the decision-making biases and other processes\nthat involve unconscious, fast processing made famous by the work of\nDaniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and colleagues (see Kahneman 2013 for\nan overview). However, it faces obstacles in dealing with other clear\ncases of manipulation. Many manipulative influences, such as peer\npressure, nagging, emotional appeals, guilt trips, do not appear to be\nhidden influences. Indeed, it is difficult not to be aware of an\nattempted influence when that influence takes the form of nagging,\npeer pressure, or a guilt trip.\n\nPerhaps, though, it is not the influence itself that must be covert in\norder for it to bypass reason in the relevant sense. Perhaps it is\nsufficient that the intent behind it must be covert. On this view, the\ninfluence itself may not bypass conscious attention. Yet it might\nstill be the case that the covertness of the intent behind it renders\nit less likely to trigger rational scrutiny by the target. Even if I\nam aware of the attempt to influence me, if I am unaware of your true\nintentions, I might fail to engage in rational deliberation about\nwhether I should try to resist your influence.\n\nSuch a view is defended by Radim Belohrad (2019), who claims that\n\n\nIn manipulation, the influencer is keen to create an impression that\nher motives are very different from what she projects. \u2026 The\nmanipulator always projects intentions that differ from her real\nintentions. (2019: 457\u2013459)\n\n\nAlong similar lines, Gregory Whitfield (2020) claims that\n\nAn act of manipulation is any intentional attempt by an agent (A) to\ncause another agent (B) to will/prefer/intend/act other than what A\ntakes B\u2019s will, preference or intention to be, where A does so\nutilizing methods that obscure and render deniable A\u2019s\nintentions vis-\u00e0-vis B (2020: 11).\n\n\nIt is certainly true that manipulators often keep their true\nintentions hidden. Iago wants Othello to think that he intends to be\nhis friend, rather than the agent of his destruction. Exaggerating the\nbenefits of doing what the manipulator wants, while understating the\nadvantages of other options (tactic 2 on our list) probably works\nbest, if at all, if the target falsely believes that the manipulator\nintends to provide objective advice. However, there are other examples\nof manipulation where the intent does not seem to be hidden. The\nintent of a teenager nagging for a new cellphone is quite\ntransparent\u2014to get the parent to provide the new phone.\nSimilarly, when adolescents engage in peer pressure to get a fellow to\nsmoke, their intention\u2014to get the target to smoke\u2014is quite\ntransparent. Targets of guilt trips often\u2014perhaps\ntypically\u2014know exactly what the guilt tripper intends to get the\ntarget to do. Perhaps anticipating these worries, Whitfield allows\nmanipulation to occur when the manipulator has merely achieved\n\u201cplausible deniability\u201d about his true intentions. It is\nnot entirely clear, though, whether this feature allows the theory to\nescape the problem of forms of manipulation like nagging and peer\npressure. It is certainly not obvious that such tactics only work, or\nonly count as manipulation, if their users can plausibly deny their\nintentions.\n\nPerhaps we might characterize manipulation not in terms of bypassing\ndeliberation altogether, but in terms of bypassing rational\ndeliberation, that is, by introducing non-rational influences into the\ndeliberative process. Thus, we might follow Joseph Raz in claiming\nthat\n\n\nmanipulation, unlike coercion, does not interfere with a\nperson\u2019s options. Instead it perverts the way that person\nreaches decisions, forms preference, or adopts goals. (Raz 1988:\n377)\n\n\nTreating manipulation as bypassing rational deliberation, and\nthen characterizing \u201cbypassing rational deliberation\u201d in\nterms of introducing non-rational influences into deliberation, would\ncohere nicely with the observation that manipulation is a contrary of\nrational persuasion.\n\nDespite its appeal, this approach faces a significant challenge: Many\nforms of non-rational influence do not seem to be manipulative. For\nexample, graphic portrayals of the dangers of smoking or texting while\ndriving are not obviously manipulative even when they impart no new\ninformation to the target (Blumenthal-Barby 2012). In addition, moral\npersuasion often involves non-rational influence. Appeals to the\nGolden Rule invite the interlocutor to imagine how it would\nfeel to be on the receiving end of the action under\nconsideration. It is difficult to believe that all such appeals are\ninherently manipulative, even when they appeal more to the feelings\nthan to facts (of which the interlocutor may already be aware).\nFinally, consider something as innocuous as dressing up before going\non a date or an interview. Presumably, the purpose of such\n\u201cimpression management\u201d is to convey a certain impression\nto the audience. Yet dressing up on a single occasion provides little\nif any rational basis for conclusions about what the\nwell-dressed person is really like day in and day out. Thus,\nimpression management of this sort seems to be an attempt at\nnon-rational influence. Yet it seems odd to count it as\nmanipulation\u2014especially if we treat \u201cmanipulation\u201d\nas having a connotation of being immoral. Of course, we might avoid\nthis problem by defining \u201cmanipulation\u201d in a morally\nneutral way, and then claiming that these forms of manipulation are\nnot immoral, while others are. But this would merely move the problem\nwithout solving it, for now we would want to know what distinguishes\nimmoral forms of manipulation from those that are not immoral.\n\nPerhaps we could address this problem by defining reason more broadly,\nso that appeals to emotions could count as forms of rational\npersuasion. Such a move might be independently motivated by the\nrejection of what some critics regard as the hyper-cognitivist radical\nseparation of reason from emotion. However, it is not clear that\nallowing emotional appeals to count as rational persuasion will get us\nvery far in defining manipulation in terms of bypassing reason. For\nwhile we will have avoided the implausible implication that all\nappeals to emotion are ipso facto manipulative, we now face\nthe question of which appeals to emotion are manipulative and which\nare not. And that is close to the very question that the idea of\nbypassing reason was supposed to help us answer.\n\nThus, despite the plausibility of the claim that manipulation bypasses\nthe target\u2019s capacities for rational deliberation, using this\nclaim to define manipulation faces serious challenges: If we\ntake \u201cbypassing\u201d very literally, then the account seems to\nmiss many examples of genuine manipulation. But if we loosen our\nunderstanding of \u201cbypassing reason\u201d so that it applies to\nany non-rational form of influence, then it seems to count as\nmanipulative many forms of influence that do not seem manipulative.\nAnd if we fix that problem by adopting a conception of reason\naccording to which appeals to the emotions are not ipso facto\nnon-rational, then we are left with the original problem of\ndetermining which appeals to the emotions are manipulative and which\nare not. Perhaps there is a way to characterize \u201cbypassing\nreason\u201d that can undergird a plausible definition of\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing reason. But the most obvious ways\nto define \u201cbypassing reason\u201d face serious problems.\n\nNevertheless, even if defining manipulation in terms of bypassing\nreason turns out to be a dead end, it is still possible that\nmanipulation really does bypass reason in some sense. But it\nmay turn out that we need an independent definition of manipulation\nbefore we can determine in what sense manipulation bypasses\nreason. Some writers, such as Cass Sunstein and Jason Hanna, seem to\nhave such an approach in mind when they initially characterize\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing or subverting reason, but then go\non to gloss \u201cbypassing or subverting\u201d in terms of some\nother account of manipulation (Sunstein 2016: 82\u201389; Hanna\n2015).\n\nHowever, a recent argument by Moti Gorin raises questions for the\nclaim that manipulation bypasses reason\u2014even when that claim is\nnot being used to define what manipulation is (Gorin 2014a). Gorin\nargues that manipulation can occur even when the target is offered\nonly good reasons. His argument turns largely on examples like this:\nJames wishes for Jacques\u2019s death, since this would enable James\nto inherit a large fortune. James knows that Jacques believes that (1)\nGod exists, and that (2) if God did not exist, life would be\nmeaningless, and he would have no reason to go on living. James\nprovides Jacques with rational arguments against the existence of God.\nThese arguments fully engage Jacques\u2019s rational faculties, and\nconsequently Jacques concludes that God does not exist. Jacques\npromptly commits suicide\u2014just as Jack had hoped he would. As\nGorin notes, James\u2019s activities do not appear to have bypassed,\nsubverted, or otherwise been detrimental to Jacques\u2019s capacity\nfor reason\u2014indeed, James depended on Jacques\u2019s ability to\nemploy his rational faculties to draw (what James regarded as) the\ncorrect conclusion from his arguments. If we accept Gorin\u2019s\ncharacterization of James\u2019s actions as manipulative, then his\nexample poses a significant challenge to the claim that manipulation\nalways bypasses the target\u2019s capacity for rational\ndeliberation.\n2.2 Manipulation as Trickery\n\nA second approach to manipulation treats it as a form of trickery, and\nties it conceptually to deception. The connection between manipulation\nand deception is a common theme in both non-philosophical and\nphilosophical discussions of manipulation. In his 1980 book\nManipulatory Politics, Robert Goodin argues that manipulation\nis inherently deceptive, and offers this test for whether an influence\nis manipulative: \u201c1. Is the interference deceptive? 2. Is the\ninterference contrary to the putative will of those subject to\nit?\u201d (Goodin, 1980: 35). In the literature on advertising, the\ncharge that (at least some) advertising is manipulative often rests on\nthe claim that it creates false beliefs or misleading associations\n(e.g., linking the vitality of the Marlboro man to a product which\ncauses lung cancer). Similarly, in his discussion of promises, T. M.\nScanlon condemns manipulation as a means of inducing false beliefs and\nexpectations (Scanlon 1998: 298\u2013322). Shlomo Cohen offers a\nsomewhat different account of the relationship between manipulation\nand deception, according to which the distinction lies in the methods\nby which the target is induced to adopt a false belief (Cohen 2018).\nBut even on this more nuanced view, there is still a strong connection\nbetween manipulation and deception.\n\nOther views in this family treat manipulation as a broader category of\nwhich deception is a special case. Whereas deception is the deliberate\nattempt to trick someone into adopting a faulty belief, these versions\nof the trickery account see manipulation as the deliberate attempt to\ntrick someone into adopting any faulty mental state\u2014belief,\ndesire, emotion, etc.\n\nAn early example of this version of the trickery approach to\nmanipulation can be found in a 1980 paper by Vance Kasten, who writes\nthat\n\n\nmanipulation occurs when there is a difference in kind between what\none intends to do and what one actually does, when that difference is\ntraceable to another in such a way that the victim may be said to have\nbeen misled. (Kasten 1980: 54)\n\n\nAlthough many of Kasten\u2019s examples of misleading involve\ndeception, he also includes examples in which manipulation involves\ninducing the target to have inappropriate emotions like guilt. More\nrecently, Robert Noggle has defended a version of this more expansive\napproach, writing that\n\n\nThere are certain norms or ideals that govern beliefs, desires, and\nemotions. Manipulative action is the attempt to get someone\u2019s\nbeliefs, desires, or emotions to violate these norms, to fall short of\nthese ideals. (Noggle 1996: 44)\n\n\nThe norms or ideals in question will vary by mental state: a belief\nfalls short of its ideal if it is false; a pattern of attention falls\nshort of its ideal if excessive attention is being paid to something\nless relevant for choice at hand; an emotion falls short of its ideal\nif it is not appropriate to the situation (Noggle 1996: 44\u201347).\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Anne Barnhill writes that\n\n\nmanipulation is directly influencing someone\u2019s beliefs, desires,\nor emotions such that she falls short of ideals for belief, desire, or\nemotion in ways typically not in her self-interest or likely not\nin her self-interest in the present context. (Barnhill 2014: 73,\nemphasis original; for a similar view, see Hanna 2015)\n\n\nClaudia Mills offers a theory that can be considered as either a\nversion of, or a close relative to, the trickery account:\n\n\nWe might say, then, that manipulation in some way purports to be\noffering good reasons, when in fact it does not. A manipulator tries\nto change another\u2019s beliefs and desires by offering her bad\nreasons, disguised as good, or faulty arguments, disguised as\nsound\u2014where the manipulator himself knows these to be bad\nreasons and faulty arguments (Mills 1995: 100; see Benn 1967 and Gorin\n2014b for somewhat similar ideas).\n\n\nA similar picture of manipulation emerges from the work of the\npolitical theorist Keith Dowding (2016, 2018). Dowding does not\nattempt to characterize manipulation directly. Rather, he proposes\nideal conditions for persuasion in a deliberative\ndemocracy\u2014conditions that would exclude manipulation. These\nconditions prohibit appealing to reasons that the persuader does not\naccept, and appealing to emotions that the persuader does not share.\nThese prohibitions seem to suggest a characterization of manipulation\nas the attempt to influence the target by appealing to what the\nmanipulator sees as bad reasons or inappropriate emotions. This\npicture of manipulation is either a version of, or a close cousin to,\nthe picture of the manipulator as trying to trick the target into\nmaking choices based on faulty beliefs or inappropriate emotions.\n\nThus, while all versions of the trickery view retain the connection\nbetween manipulation and deception, some extend it to include tricking\nthe target into adopting any faulty mental state, including\nbeliefs, desires, emotions, etc. This view might be further expanded\nby adopting Michael Cholbi\u2019s observation that the phenomenon of\nego depletion might induce targets of manipulation to form faulty\nintentions (that is, intentions that do not reflect their considered\nvalues) because their resistance to temptation has been worn down\n(Cholbi 2014).\n\nThe trickery view can be motivated by appeal to various examples, one\nespecially fruitful set of which is Shakespeare\u2019s\nOthello. It seems natural to describe Shakespeare\u2019s\ncharacter Iago as a manipulator. The activities in virtue of which he\nmerits this label seem to involve various forms of trickery. For\nexample, through insinuation, innuendo and cleverly arranging\ncircumstances (like a strategically placed handkerchief) he tricks\nOthello into suspecting\u2014and then believing\u2014that his new\nbride Desdemona has been unfaithful. He then plays on Othello\u2019s\ninsecurities and other emotions to lead him into an irrational\njealousy and rage that both overshadow his love for Desdemona and\ncloud his judgment about how to react. The trickery view accounts for\nour sense that Iago manipulates Othello by noting that Iago tricks him\ninto adopting various faulty mental states\u2014false beliefs,\nunwarranted suspicions, irrational emotions, and so on.\n\nProponents of the trickery view disagree over several details, most\nnotably how to define a faulty mental state. Some proponents\nof the trickery view argue that manipulation occurs when the\ninfluencer attempts to induce what the influencer regards as\na faulty mental state into the target\u2019s deliberations (Mills\n1995; Noggle 1996; this idea is built into Dowding\u2019s account).\nOthers argue that we should define manipulation in terms of the\nattempt to introduce an objectively faulty mental state into\nthe target\u2019s deliberations (Hanna 2015: 634; see also Sunstein\n2016: 89). Anne Barnhill suggests that our usage of the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d is inconsistent on the question of whose\nstandards determine whether the influencer attempts to induce the\ntarget to adopt a faulty mental state (Barnhill 2014).\n\nAlthough the trickery account has considerable appeal, it faces an\nimportant challenge: It apparently fails to count as manipulative a\nwhole class of tactics that seem, intuitively, to be manipulative.\nTactics like charm, peer pressure, and emotional blackmail (tactics 1,\n5, and 9) do not seem to involve trickery. Yet it seems quite natural\nto regard them as examples of manipulation.\n2.3 Manipulation as Pressure\n\nA third way to characterize manipulation is to treat it as a kind of\npressure to do as the influencer wishes. On this account, tactics like\nemotional blackmail and peer pressure are paradigm cases of\nmanipulation, since they exert pressure on the target by imposing\ncosts for failing to do what the manipulator wishes. One rationale for\ntreating manipulation as a form of pressure is the observation that\nmanipulation is neither rational persuasion nor coercion. It seems\nplausible, then, to suppose that there is a continuum between rational\npersuasion and coercion with regard to the level of pressure being\nexerted, with rational persuasion exerting no pressure, coercion\nexerting maximum pressure, and the middle region, manipulation,\nexerting pressure that falls short of being coercive. In this way, we\nmight arrive at the idea that manipulation is a form of pressure that\ndoes not rise to the level of coercion.\n\nOne of the earliest philosophical accounts of manipulation, by Ruth\nFaden, Tom Beauchamp, and Nancy King, has this structure. They begin\nby contrasting using rational persuasion to convince a patient to take\na medically necessary drug with simply coercing him to take it. Then\nthey observe that\n\n\nThere are many in-between cases: For example, suppose the physician\nhas made clear that he or she will be upset with the patient if the\npatient does not take the drug, and the patient is intimidated.\nAlthough the patient is not convinced that it is the best course to\ntake the medication, \u2026 the patient agrees to take the drug\nbecause it appears that acceptance will foster a better relationship\nwith the doctor\u2026 Here the patient performs the action \u2026\nunder a heavy measure of control by the physician\u2019s\nrole, authority, and indeed prescription. Unlike the first case, the\npatient does not find it overwhelmingly difficult to resist the\nphysician\u2019s proposal, but, unlike the second case, it is\nnonetheless awkward and difficult to resist this rather\n\u201ccontrolling\u201d physician. (Faden, Beauchamp, & King\n1986: 258)\n\n\nThey claim that such \u201cin between\u201d cases constitute\nmanipulation. However, they do not claim that all forms of\nmanipulation fall into the middle region of this continuum; they also\ncount forms of deception, indoctrination, and seduction as\nmanipulative, and claim that\n\n\nsome manipulative strategies can be as controlling as coercion or as\nnoncontrolling as persuasion; other manipulations fall somewhere\nbetween these endpoints. (Faden, Beauchamp, & King 1986: 259)\n\n\nNevertheless, the idea that at least some forms of manipulation\ninvolve pressure has been very influential.\n\nJoel Feinberg offers a similar account of manipulation. He writes that\nmany techniques for getting someone to act in a certain way\n\n\ncan be placed on a spectrum of force running from compulsion proper,\nat one extreme, through compulsive pressure, coercion proper, and\ncoercive pressure, to manipulation, persuasion, enticement, and simple\nrequests at the other extreme. The line between forcing to act and\nmerely getting to act is drawn somewhere in the manipulation or\npersuasion part of the scale. (Feinberg 1989: 189)\n\n\nMichael Kligman and Charles Culver offer a similar account:\n\n\nThe attempt to influence B\u2019s behavior takes on a\nmanipulative character when \u2026 A\u2019s primary intent\nis no longer to convince B, in a good faith manner, that\nacting as desired by A would be in keeping with\nB\u2019s rational assessments of outcome; [but rather] to\nprocure or engineer the needed assent by bringing pressure to bear, in\na deliberate and calculated way, on what he presume to be the\nmanipulable features of B\u2019s motivational system.\n(Kligman & Culver 1992: 186\u2013187)\n\n\nKligman and Culver go on to distinguish this manipulative pressure\nfrom coercion by claiming that the latter, unlike the former, involves\n\u201csufficiently strong incentives \u2026 that it would be\nunreasonable to expect any rational person not to so act\u201d\n(Kligman & Culver 1992: 187). More recently, Marcia Baron and\nAllen Wood have also discussed forms of manipulation that seem best\ncharacterized as forms of pressure (Baron 2003; Wood 2014).\n\nAlthough we can treat the idea that manipulation consists of a form of\npressure as a full-fledged theory of manipulation, most of the authors\njust cited hold only that some forms of manipulation consist of\npressure. In particular, most agree with Faden, Beauchamp, and King,\nthat other forms of manipulation are more akin to deception. Thus, it\nis somewhat artificial to speak of the pressure model as a theory\nmeant to cover all forms of manipulation. It is more accurate to\nregard the pressure model as claiming that exerting non-coercive\npressure is sufficient (but perhaps not necessary) for an influence to\ncount as manipulative.\n2.4 Disjunctive, Hybrid, and Other Views\n\nOur discussion of the trickery and pressure accounts highlights a\nrather striking fact: If we survey the tactics that seem intuitively\nto be examples of manipulation, we find tactics that seem best\ndescribed as forms of trickery as well as tactics that seem best\ndescribed as forms of pressure. This is puzzling, since, on the face\nof it, trickery and pressure seem rather dissimilar. What should we\nmake of the fact that we use the same\nconcept\u2014manipulation\u2014to refer to methods of influence that\nseem to operate by such dissimilar mechanisms?\n\nSeveral responses are possible. First, it is possible that the common\nusage of term \u201cmanipulation\u201d refers to such a diverse set\nof phenomena that no single analysis will capture every form of\ninfluence to which the term is commonly applied. Felicia Ackerman\nargues that the term \u201cmanipulation\u201d exhibits\n\u201ccombinatorial vagueness\u201d: while it is connected to\nfeatures like inhibition of rational deliberation, unethicalness,\ndeceptiveness, playing upon non-rational impulses, shrewdness,\npressure, etc., \u201cno condition on the list is sufficient,\n\u2026 and no single condition \u2026 is even necessary\u201d for\nan instance of influence to be manipulative (Ackerman 1995:\n337\u201338).\n\nSecond, we might hold that the concept of manipulation is not vague\nbut rather disjunctive, so that manipulation consists of\neither trickery or pressure. Indeed, in one of the\nearliest philosophical analyses of manipulation, Joel Rudinow takes\nthis approach. Rudinow begins with the following thesis:\n\n\nA attempts to manipulate S iff A attempts\nto influence S\u2019s behavior by means of deception or\npressure or by playing on a supposed weakness of S. (Rudinow\n1978: 343)\n\n\nHe goes on to claim that that the use of pressure is manipulative only\nif the would-be manipulator directs it at some supposed weakness in\nhis target that will render the target unable to resist it; this leads\nhim to finalize his definition in terms of \u201cdeception or by\nplaying upon a supposed weakness\u201d of the target, with the second\ndisjunct meant to cover pressure-based tactics (Rudinow 1978: 346).\nSeveral other philosophers have followed Rudinow\u2019s disjunctive\napproach to defining manipulation (Tomlinson 1986; Sher 2011; Mandava\n& Millum 2013). Indeed, as we have noted, it is common for people\nwho discuss manipulative pressure to claim that manipulation comes in\nother forms as well.\n\nA somewhat different version of the disjunctive strategy might begin\nwith the pressure account\u2019s continuum pressure of between\nrational persuasion and coercion, but go on to add a second dimension\nconsisting of a continuum between rational persuasion and outright\nlying. We might then define manipulation in terms of a two-dimensional\nspace bounded by rational persuasion, outright lying, and coercion. A\nstrategy like this is suggested by Sapir Handelman, although he adds a\nthird dimension that measures the level of \u201ccontrol\u201d that\na given form of influence exerts (Handelman 2009).\n\nPatricia Greenspan suggests that manipulation is a sort of hybrid\nbetween coercion and deception. She writes that\n\n\ncases of manipulation seem to have a foot in both of the usual\ncategories of intentional interference with another agent\u2019s\nautonomy, coercion and deception, but partly as a result, they do not\nfit squarely in either category. (Greenspan 2003: 157)\n\n\nThus, we might characterize her view as a \u201cconjunctive\u201d\ntheory of manipulation, according to which it contains elements of\nboth pressure and deception. It certainly seems true\nthat manipulators often use both pressure and deception. For example,\na manipulator who employs peer pressure might also exaggerate the\nextent to which the target\u2019s peers will disapprove of her if she\nchooses the option that the manipulator wants her not to choose.\nHowever, we can also point to relatively pure cases of manipulative\npressure or manipulative trickery: Indeed, all of the items on the\nlist above can be imagined as involving either pure pressure or pure\ntrickery. The apparent existence of cases of manipulation that involve\nonly deception or only pressure seems to be a problem for\nGreenspan\u2019s hybrid view.\n\nStrategies for characterizing manipulation that combine the trickery\nand pressure accounts are appealing because they seem to do a better\njob than either the trickery or pressure account alone in accounting\nfor the wide variety of tactics that seem intuitively to count as\nmanipulation. However, this wider coverage comes at a price. If the\ndisjunctive approach simply puts an \u201cor\u201d between the\ntrickery and pressure accounts, then it will leave unanswered the\nquestion of what, if anything, makes all forms of manipulation\nmanifestations of the same phenomenon. Of course, it is possible that\nthis question cannot be answered because, as a matter of fact, there\nare two irreducibly different forms of manipulation. But this seems\nlike a conclusion that we should accept only reluctantly, after having\nmade a good faith effort to determine whether there really is anything\nin common between pressure-based manipulation and trickery-based\nmanipulation. (For a recent attempt to locate a common feature of\nmanipulative pressure and manipulative trickery, see Noggle 2020).\n\nOne possible answer to this challenge might be drawn from Marcia\nBaron\u2019s important paper on \u201cManipulativeness\u201d, which\ndiagnoses the underlying moral wrong in manipulation in terms of an\nAristotelian vice. She suggests treating manipulativeness as the vice\nof excess with regard to \u201cto what extent\u2014and how and when\nand to whom and for what sorts of ends\u2014to seek to influence\nothers\u2019 conduct\u201d (Baron 2003: 48). On her view,\nmanipulativeness is at the opposite extreme from the vice of\n\n\nrefraining from offering potentially helpful counsel; or refraining\nfrom trying to stop someone from doing something very dangerous, for\nexample, from driving home from one\u2019s house while drunk. (Baron\n2003: 48)\n\n\nPerhaps, then, we can understand the underlying similarity between\ntrickery- and pressure-based manipulation as manifestations of a\ncommon vice, as different ways of going wrong with regard to how and\nhow much we should try to influence those around us.\n\nAlthough Baron\u2019s remarks about the mind-set of the manipulator\nare insightful and instructive, it is unclear whether they suffice to\nanswer the characterization question. For it is unclear whether, by\nthemselves, they can distinguish manipulation from other forms of\nexcess with regard to influence, such as coercion.\n\nThe idea that manipulation should be characterized at least in part by\nreference to the mindset of the manipulator also appears in recent\nwork by Michael Klenk (2022). According to Klenk, the manipulator\ninfluences negligently: manipulation involves influencing someone by\nsome method while disregarding whether that method reveals reasons for\nthe target to do, think, or feel as the manipulator wishes (Klenk\n2022: 97).  While this view requires a certain mindset from the\nmanipulator, it also has some affinities for the trickery view,\ninasmuch as the negligence required is negligence with regard to\nwhether the influence tricks the target into changing how he feels,\nacts, or thinks for a bad reason or no reason at all. A hybrid view\nalong these lines might allow us to integrate some of Baron\u2019s\ninsights about the manipulator\u2019s mindset with a more specific\ncharacterization of the sort of influence to which that mindset\nleads.\n3. Answering the Evaluation Question\n\nA complete answer to the evaluation question should tell us about the\nsort of wrongfulness that manipulation possesses: Is it absolutely\nimmoral, pro tanto immoral, prima facie immoral,\netc.? It should also tell us when manipulation is immoral if\nit is not always immoral. Finally, a satisfactory answer to the\nevaluation question should tell us why it is immoral in cases\nwhen it is immoral.\n3.1 Is Manipulation Always Wrong?\n\nSuppose that Tonya is a captured terrorist who has hidden a bomb in\nthe city and that her preferred course of action is to keep its\nlocation secret until it explodes. And suppose that Irving is an FBI\ninterrogator who wants Tonya to reveal the bomb\u2019s location\nbefore it explodes. How would this way filling in the details of the\ncase change our moral assessment of the various ways that Irving might\ninduce Tonya to change her mind?\n\nOne rather extreme answer would be: \u201cnot at all\u201d. This\nhardline view would hold that manipulation is always morally wrong, no\nmatter what the consequences. Inasmuch as this hardline view resembles\nKant\u2019s notorious hardline position that lying is always wrong,\none might look to Kant\u2019s ethics for considerations to support\nit. But just as hardly anyone accepts Kant\u2019s hardline position\nagainst lying, the hardline view against manipulation also seems short\non defenders.\n\nA less extreme position would be that while manipulation is always\npro tanto wrong, other moral considerations can sometimes\noutweigh the pro tanto wrongness of manipulation. Thus, we\nmight think that manipulation is always wrong to some extent, but that\ncountervailing moral factors might sometimes suffice to make\nmanipulation justified on balance. What might such factors include?\nOne obvious candidate would be consequences\u2014for example, the\nfact that Irving\u2019s successful manipulation of Tonya would save\nmany innocent lives. Non-consequentialist factors might also be\nthought to be countervailing considerations: Perhaps the immorality of\nTonya\u2019s character, or the fact that she is acting on an evil\ndesire or intention, is a countervailing factor that can outweigh the\npro tanto wrongness of Irving\u2019s manipulation. It is\nimportant to note that, on this view, the fact that an action involves\nmanipulation is always a moral reason to avoid it, even if stronger\ncountervailing considerations render it not wrong on balance. For\nexample, even if Irving\u2019s manipulation of Terrorist Tonya is not\nwrong on balance (e.g., because of the innocent lives that will be\nsaved), if Irving can get Tonya to reveal the bomb\u2019s location\nwithout manipulation (or anything else that is comparably immoral),\nthen it would be morally better to avoid manipulating her.\n\nBy contrast, we might hold that manipulation is merely prima\nfacie immoral. On this view, there is a presumption that\nmanipulation is immoral, but this presumption can be defeated in some\nsituations. When the presumption is defeated, manipulation is\nnot wrong at all (i.e., not even pro tanto wrong). On this\nview, we might say that while manipulation is usually wrong, it is not\nwrong at all in the terrorist scenario. On this view, not only is\nIrving\u2019s manipulation of Terrorist Tonya not wrong on balance,\nbut there is not even any moral reason for him to choose a\nnon-manipulative method of getting Tonya to reveal the bomb\u2019s\nlocation if one is available.\n\nA more complex\u2014but, perhaps, ultimately more\nplausible\u2014view would combine the prima facie and\npro tanto approaches. Such a view would hold that\nmanipulation is prima facie immoral, but that when it is\nwrong, the wrongness is pro tanto rather than absolute. On\nthis view, there are situations in which the presumption against\nmanipulation is defeated and manipulation is not even pro\ntanto wrong. Perhaps bluffing in poker is like this. But where\nthe presumption is not defeated, the wrongness of manipulation is only\npro tanto, and thus able to be outweighed by sufficiently\nweighty countervailing moral considerations. In such cases, even if it\nis not wrong on balance to manipulate, it would still be morally\npreferable to avoid manipulation in favor of some other, morally\nlegitimate, form of influence. Manipulating a friend into refraining\nfrom sending a text to rekindle an abusive relationship might be an\nexample where the pro tanto wrongness of manipulation is\noutweighed by other considerations. In such a case, it seems plausible\nto maintain that it would be morally preferable to use reason rather\nthan manipulation to get one\u2019s friend to see that sending the\ntext would be a mistake, even if the facts of the situation would\njustify resorting to manipulation. A view along these lines has been\ndefended by Marcia Baron (2014: 116\u201317). Although this view is\nfar less absolute than the hardline view, it retains the claim that\nmanipulation is prima facie wrong, so that there is always a\npresumption that it is immoral, though this presumption is sometimes\ndefeated. It is also compatible with the idea that the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d has built into it a connotation of moral\ndis-approbation.\n\nHowever, the claim that manipulation is presumptively wrong might be\nchallenged. One might argue that \u201cmanipulation\u201d is, or at\nleast should be, a morally neutral term without even the presumption\nof immorality. On this view, whether a given instance of manipulation\nis immoral will always depend on the facts of the situation, and the\nterm itself includes (or should include) no presumption one way or the\nother. Clearly there are non-moralized notions of manipulation. When\nwe speak of a scientist manipulating variables in an experiment, or a\npilot manipulating the plane\u2019s controls, our use of the term is\ndevoid of any hint of moral opprobrium. In the social sciences, we can\nfind cases of the term \u201cmanipulation\u201d being used in a\nmorally neutral way even when another person is the target of\nmanipulation. For example, several papers by the evolutionary\npsychologist David M. Buss and colleagues use the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d more or less as a synonym for\n\u201cinfluence\u201d in their discussions of how humans influence\nthe behavior of other humans (D.M. Buss 1992; D.M. Buss et al. 1987).\nOf course, pointing out morally neutral usages of\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d does not really settle the question of\nwhether we should prefer a moralized or a non-moralized notion of\nmanipulation. An argument for preferring a non-moralized notion of\nmanipulation is provided by Allen Wood, who writes that\n\n\nIf we think that moral argument should proceed not merely by invoking\nour pro- or con- sentiments, or appealing to our unargued intuitions,\nbut instead by identifying objective facts about a situation that give\nus good reasons for condemning or approving certain things, then we\nwould generally do much better to use a non-moralized sense of words\nlike \u201ccoercion\u201d, \u201cmanipulation\u201d, and\n\u201cexploitation\u201d\u2014a sense in which these words can be\nused to refer to such objective facts. (Wood 2014: 19\u201320)\n\n\nNo matter how we answer the question of whether manipulation in\ngeneral is absolutely immoral, prima facie immoral, pro\ntanto immoral, or not even presumptively immoral, there are\nclearly situations in which manipulation is immoral. Any complete\nanswer to the evaluation question must explain why manipulation is\nimmoral in those cases where it is immoral. In addition, any view that\nholds that manipulation is only pro tanto and/or prima\nfacie immoral should tell us what sorts of considerations can\ndefeat the presumption that it is immoral and/or outweigh its pro\ntanto immorality. Several accounts have been offered to identify\nthe source of the moral wrongfulness of manipulation (when it is\nwrong).\n3.2 Manipulation and Harm\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward way to explain the wrongfulness of\nmanipulation (when it is wrong) would point to the harm done to its\ntargets. Manipulation is commonly used aggressively, as a way to harm\nthe manipulator\u2019s target, or at least to benefit the manipulator\nat the target\u2019s expense. The harmfulness of manipulation seems\nespecially salient in manipulative relationships, where manipulation\nmay lead to subordination and even abuse. The more minor economic harm\nof the extraction of money from consumers might be cited as a\nwrong-making feature of manipulative advertising, and there has been\nsome discussion of how manipulation might lead targets to enter into\nexploitative contracts. Systematic political manipulation may weaken\ndemocratic institutions and perhaps even lead to tyranny.\n\nBut not all instances of manipulation harm their victims. In fact,\nmanipulation sometimes benefits its target. If the harm to the victim\nis the only wrong-making feature of manipulation, then paternalistic\nor beneficent manipulation could never be even pro tanto\nwrong. But this claim strikes most people as implausible. To see this,\nconsider that the debate about whether paternalistic nudges are\nwrongfully manipulative is not settled simply by pointing out that\nthey benefit their targets. The fact that it seems possible for an act\nto be wrongfully manipulative, even though it benefits (and is\nintended to benefit) the target, presumably explains why there are\nfew, if any, defenses of the claim that manipulation is wrong\nonly when and because it harms the target. Nevertheless, it\nseems plausible to hold that when manipulation does harm its target,\nthis harm adds to the wrongness of the manipulative behavior.\n3.3 Manipulation and Autonomy\n\nAnother natural way to account for the wrongness of manipulation would\nbe to claim that it violates, undermines, or is otherwise antithetical\nto the target\u2019s personal autonomy. Manipulation, by definition,\ninfluences decision-making by means that\u2014unlike rational\npersuasion\u2014do not seem to be autonomy-preserving. Thus, it is\nnatural to regard it as interfering with autonomous decision-making.\nThe idea that manipulation is wrong because it undermines autonomous\nchoice is implicit in discussions of manipulation as a potential\ninvalidator of consent. But even outside of discussions of autonomous\nconsent, the claim that manipulation is immoral because it undermines\nautonomy is commonly made (and perhaps even more commonly\nassumed).\n\nHowever, there are reasons for caution about tying the moral status of\nmanipulation too tightly to its effects on autonomy. One can imagine\ncases where it is not obvious that manipulation undermines autonomy.\nOne can even imagine cases where manipulation might enhance the\ntarget\u2019s overall autonomy. For example, a teacher might\nmanipulate a student into taking a class which ultimately enhances her\nautonomy by opening new career options, improving her skills of\ncritical self-reflection, etc. We might also imagine cases where\nmanipulation is used to support the target\u2019s autonomous choice.\nSuppose that Tonya has autonomously decided to leave an abusive\npartner, but that she is now tempted to go back. If Irving resorts to\na manipulative tactic designed to keep her from backsliding on her\nautonomous choice to leave her abuser, then his action might seem less\nlike undermining Tonya\u2019s autonomy and more like supporting\nit.\n\nOne might respond that these examples do not undermine the claim that\nmanipulation is wrong when and because it undermines autonomy because\nthese autonomy-enhancing instances of manipulation are not wrong.\nHowever, this response faces a complication: Consider the case where\nIrving manipulates Tonya into resisting the temptation to backslide on\nher resolution to leave her abusive partner. It seems plausible to say\nthat Irving\u2019s manipulation in this case is not wrong on balance.\nBut it also seems plausible to say that it was nevertheless pro\ntanto wrong, since it seems plausible to think that it would have\nbeen morally preferable for Irving to find some non-manipulative way\nto help Tonya avoid backsliding. But this judgment seems inconsistent\nwith the claim that manipulation is wrong when and because it\nundermines autonomy. Of course, it is open to defenders of the\nautonomy account of the wrongness of manipulation to bite the bullet\nhere and deny that autonomy-enhancing manipulation is even pro\ntanto immoral.\n\nAlternatively\u2014and perhaps more plausibly\u2014the defender of\nthe autonomy account of the wrongness of manipulation might concede\nthat Irving\u2019s autonomy-enhancing manipulation of Tonya is\npro tanto wrong. But she might explain this by claiming that\nwhile the manipulation is autonomy-enhancing overall, it nevertheless\nundermines Tonya\u2019s autonomy in the short term. The fact that\nIrving\u2019s manipulation undermines Tonya\u2019s autonomy\ntemporarily explains why it is pro tanto immoral\u2014and\nwhy it would be morally better for Irving to find a non-manipulative\nway to help Tonya avoid backsliding. But the fact that the\nmanipulation enhances Tonya\u2019s autonomy overall explains why it\nis not immoral on balance. Of course, this strategy will not appeal to\nthose who hold that it is wrong to undermine a person\u2019s autonomy\neven when doing so enhances that same person\u2019s overall\nautonomy.\n\nA more significant threat to the link between manipulation and\nautonomy appears in an influential paper by Sarah Buss. She argues\nthat \u201cwhen we are obligated to refrain from manipulation or\ndeceiving one another, this has relatively little to do with the value\nof autonomy\u201d (S. Buss 2005: 208). Buss\u2019s argument has two\nparts. First, she claims that manipulation does not, in fact, deprive\nits victim of the ability to make choices; indeed, it typically\npresupposes that the target will make her own choice. But if the\nmanipulation does not take away the target\u2019s choice, Buss\nmaintains, it does not undermine her autonomy. (For a similar\nargument, see Long 2014). Second, Buss argues that it is false to\nclaim that an autonomous agent would rationally reject being subjected\nto manipulative influences. To support this claim, Buss argues that\nmanipulation and deception are \u201cpervasive forms of human\ninteraction which are often quite benign and even valuable\u201d (S.\nBuss 2005: 224). Her most notable example is the cultivation of\nromantic love, which often involves\u2014and may even\nrequire\u2014significant amounts of behavior that is aptly described\nas manipulation.\n\nDefenders of the link between autonomy and the wrongness of\nmanipulation are not without potential replies to Buss\u2019s\nintriguing argument. For one thing, it seems possible to craft a\nnotion of autonomy according to which having false information (or\nother faulty mental states) or being subjected to pressure (even when\nit does not rise to the level of coercion) compromise a person\u2019s\nautonomy. Even though false beliefs about how to achieve one\u2019s\nends may not compromise one\u2019s authentic values or one\u2019s\npowers of practical reasoning, they do seem to compromise one\u2019s\nability to achieve one\u2019s autonomously-chosen ends, and it is\nplausible to regard this as a diminishment of (some form of) autonomy.\nMoreover, the defender of the link between autonomy and the wrongness\nof manipulation might simply deny that the forms of manipulation to\nwhich an autonomous agent would consent (for example, those required\nby romantic love) are wrongful cases of manipulation.\n3.4 Manipulation and Treating Persons as Things\n\nSeveral accounts of manipulation tie its moral status to the fact that\nit influences behavior by methods that seem analogous to how one might\noperate a tool or a device. On this view, manipulation involves\ntreating the target as a device to be operated rather than an agent to\nbe reasoned with. As Claudia Mills puts it,\n\n\na manipulator is interested in reasons not as logical justifiers but\nas causal levers. For the manipulator, reasons are tools, and bad\nreasons can work as well as, or better than, a good one. (Mills 1995:\n100\u2013101)\n\n\nThe point here is that a manipulator treats his target not as a fellow\nrational agent, for that would require giving good reasons for doing\nas the manipulator proposes. Instead, the manipulator treats his\ntarget as a being whose behavior is to be elicited by pressing the\nmost effective \u201ccausal levers\u201d.\n\nOf course, the idea that treating a person as a mere object is immoral\nis a prominent feature of Kant\u2019s account of respect for persons\n(see the entry on\n respect).\n Thus, it would be natural to appeal to Kantian ideas to help\nelaborate the idea that manipulation is wrong because of the way that\nit treats its target. As Thomas E. Hill writes,\n\n\nThe idea that one should try to reason with others rather than to\nmanipulate them by nonrational techniques is manifest in Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of the duty to respect others. (Hill 1980: 96)\n\n\nAlthough\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\n is a natural place to look for the idea that the wrongfulness of\nmanipulation derives from a failure to treat the target as a person,\nthere are potential drawbacks to tying the account too tightly to\nKant. For Kant\u2019s notion of rational agency appears to be of the\nhyper-cognitive, hyper-intellectual variety. Hence, if it is unethical\nto fail to treat someone as that kind of rational agent, we\nmight be pushed toward the conclusion that the only acceptable basis\nfor human interaction is the kind of coldly intellectual rational\npersuasion that excludes any appeal to emotions. But as we saw\nearlier, there are good reasons for regarding such a conclusion as\nimplausible.\n\nThese considerations certainly do not entail that it is hopeless to\nlook to some notion of treating persons as things for an account of\nthe wrongfulness of manipulation. But they do suggest that more work\nmust be done before the claim that manipulation is wrong because it\ntreats a person as a mere thing can be regarded as much more than a\nplatitude.\n3.5 Other Suggestions\n\nAlthough harm, autonomy, and treating persons as things are the most\nprominent suggestions about what makes manipulation wrong when it is\nwrong, one can find other suggestions in the literature. For example,\nMarcia Baron\u2019s virtue-theoretic account of manipulativeness\nsuggests that we might account for what is wrong about manipulation in\nterms of the character of the manipulator (Baron 2003). Patricia\nGreenspan suggests that when manipulation is immoral, it is because it\nviolates the terms of the relationship between the manipulator and his\ntarget\u2014terms that will vary according to the nature of the\nrelationship between them (Greenspan 2003). Such a view\nsuggests\u2014plausibly\u2014that the moral status of a given\ninstance of manipulation will depend at least in part on the nature of\nthe relationship between the influencer and the target of the\ninfluence.\n4. Further Issues\n\nIn addition to answering the identification and evaluation questions,\na complete theory of manipulation should address several further\nissues.\n4.1 Manipulating Persons versus Manipulating Situations\n\nDiscussions of manipulation often distinguish between cases where the\nmanipulator influences his target directly, and cases where the\nmanipulator influences the target\u2019s behavior by arranging the\ntarget\u2019s environment in ways that induce her to act one way\nrather than another. Consider Joel Rudinow\u2019s example of a\nmalingerer who manipulates a psychiatrist into admitting him to the\npsychiatric ward (Rudinow 1978). He does this by fooling a police\nofficer into thinking he is about to commit suicide. The police\nofficer brings him to the ward, reports that he is suicidal, and\nrequests that he be admitted. Although the psychiatrist is not fooled,\nher hospital\u2019s rules force her to admit the malingerer at the\npolice officer\u2019s request. It seems clear that the malingerer has\nmanipulated the police officer by tricking him into adopting a faulty\nbelief. But the psychiatrist, while not falling for the feigned\nsuicide attempt and thus not adopting any faulty beliefs, is\nnevertheless induced to do what she did not want to do. Although it\nseems correct to say that the psychiatrist was manipulated, this form\nof manipulation seems different from what was done to the police\nofficer. By feigning a suicide attempt, the malingerer has tampered\nwith the police officer\u2019s beliefs. But he has maneuvered the\npsychiatrist into admitting him, not by tampering with her\npsychological states, but rather by \u201cgaming the system\u201d,\nas we might say.\n\nIn his book, The Art of Political Manipulation (Riker 1986)\nthe political scientist William Riker calls the latter form of\nmanipulation \u201cheresthetic,\u201d and characterizes it as\n\u201cstructuring the world so you can win\u201d (1986: ix). His\nfocus is on political tactics like gerrymandering, poison pill\namendments, and strategic voting, all of which are often described as\nmanipulation, and all of which seem more like what Rudinow\u2019s\nmalingerer does to the psychiatrist than what he does to the police\nofficer.\n\nIn a similar way, the sociologists Donald Warwick and Herbert Kelman\ndistinguish between \u201cenvironmental\u201d and\n\u201cpsychic\u201d manipulation (Warwick & Kelman 1973). Their\nwork influenced Faden, Beauchamp, and King\u2019s seminal\nphilosophical account of manipulation, which makes a similar\ndistinction (Faden, Beauchamp, & King 1986: 355\u201368). Anne\nBarnhill distinguishes between manipulation that \u201cchanges the\noptions available to the person or changes the situation she\u2019s\nin, and thereby changes her attitudes\u201d on the one hand, and\nmanipulation that \u201cchanges a person\u2019s attitudes directly\nwithout changing the options available to her or the surrounding\nsituation\u201d on the other (Barnhill 2014: 53). Drawing a similar\ndistinction, Claudia Mills writes\n\n\nIf A wants to get B to do act x, there are two\ngeneral strategies that A might undertake. A might\nchange, or propose to change, the external or objective features of\nB\u2019s choice situation; or alternatively, A\nmight try to alter certain internal or subjective features of\nB\u2019s choice situation. While some writers might call\nboth strategies manipulative, at least in certain circumstances, I\nprefer to reserve the label manipulation for a subset of\nmorally problematic actions falling in the second category. (Mills\n1995: 97)\n\n\nAlthough Rudinow\u2019s case provides a clear contrast between what\nwe might call psychological manipulation and situational manipulation,\nthis distinction\u2014or at least its importance\u2014is not always\nso clear. Consider\n tactic 9\n above, where Irving threatens to withdraw his friendship if Tonya\ndoes not do as Irving wishes. Is this direct psychological\nmanipulation, or situational manipulation? The criterion offered by\nBarnhill and others counts it as situational manipulation, since\nIrving changes Tonya\u2019s choice situation so that doing Y and\nretaining Irving\u2019s friendship is no longer an option. But how is\nthis tactic any less of a direct interference with Tonya\u2019s\ndecision than if Irving had engaged in some form of deception? Why\nwould it be more like what the malingerer does to the police officer\nthan what he does to the psychiatrist?\n\nThis is not to deny that there is a difference between psychological\nand situational manipulation. Instead, it is to ask what that\ndifference is, and why it might matter. Presumably, the distinction is\nmeant to differentiate between tactics that affect a target\u2019s\nbehavior by directly tampering with her psychology and those that do\nnot. But if this is the distinction, then it seems plausible to think\nthat Irving\u2019s use of emotional blackmail is at least as direct a\ntampering with Tonya\u2019s psychology as, say, Iago\u2019s dropping\nof the handkerchief in a location where it will trick Othello into\nbecoming inappropriately suspicious. Yet criteria like those proposed\nby Mills and Barnhill seem to imply that these two forms of\nmanipulation are on opposite sides of that distinction.\n\nNevertheless, there does seem something importantly different between\nwhat the malingerer in Rudinow\u2019s example does to the police\nofficer and what he does to the psychiatrist. But much work remains to\nbe done to provide a well-motivated account of that difference. Such\nan account should not only get the intuitively right answers in cases\nof direct pressure (like emotional blackmail) and indirect deception\n(like Iago\u2019s dropping the handkerchief), but it should also\nexplain whether and why the distinction makes a moral difference.\n4.2 Manipulation and Intent\n\nSome views of manipulation seem to suggest, if not require, that\nmanipulators have fairly complex intentions\u2014such as the\nintention to lead the target astray\u2014for manipulation to occur.\nMarcia Baron and Kate Manne offer compelling reasons to think that\nsuch requirements are too strong. Baron argues that manipulation can\noccur even if the manipulator only has\n\n\na combination of intent and recklessness: the aim of getting the other\nperson do what one wants, together with recklessness in the way that\none goes about reaching that goal. (Baron 2014: 103)\n\n\nShe goes on to argue that the manipulator need not be aware that she\nhas that intention (Baron 2014, 101). Manne agrees; to support this\nclaim, she offers the example of Joan, who gives extravagant gifts to\nrelatives who pay her less attention than (she thinks) they should\n(Manne 2014, 225). Manne tells Joan\u2019s story in such a way that\nit seems plausible to say both that Joan\u2019s gift-giving is a\nmanipulative attempt to make her relatives feel guilty, and that Joan\ndoes not consciously intend to make her relatives feel guilty. If\nManne\u2019s description of her example is correct, then it seems\nthat Joan can manipulate her relatives into feeling guilty without\nhaving any conscious intention of making them feel guilty. (Later,\nManne [2014, 235] goes even farther, suggesting that \u201cpeople can\neven behave manipulatively despite consciously intending not\nto.\u201d) Of course, those who hold that manipulation requires more\nconscious intention than Manne allows might simply deny that\nJoan\u2019s behavior is manipulative. Nevertheless, the arguments\noffered by Baron and Manne raise important questions about the level\nof conscious intentionality required for an action to be\nmanipulative.\n\nThe question of what sort of intention is required for an act to count\nas manipulative has practical implications for assessing the behavior\nof children, who sometimes behave in ways that seem aptly described as\nmanipulative even when they are too young to have the complicated\nintentions that some theories of manipulation might require. Similar\nworries arise for assessing the behavior of people for whom\nmanipulativeness has become a habit, or a part of their personalities.\nIndeed, certain personality disorders\u2014such as borderline\npersonality disorder and antisocial personality disorder\u2014are\noften characterized by manipulativeness, as is the so-called\nMachiavellian personality type (Christie & Geis 1970). As\nprofessor of psychiatric nursing Len Bowers writes,\n\n\nthe manipulative behaviour of some personality-disordered (PD)\npatients is consistent and frequent. It is an integral part of their\ninterpersonal style, a part of the very disorder itself. (Bowers 2003:\n329; see also Potter 2006)\n\n\nIn such cases, one wonders what level of intentionality lies behind\nbehavior that we would otherwise think of as manipulative. Even if we\nare inclined to regard childhood or certain personality disorders as\nfactors that mitigate the blameworthiness of manipulative behavior, it\nwould seem counterintuitive for a theory of manipulation to say that\nchildren and persons with personality disorders are incapable of\nacting manipulatively.\n4.3 Manipulation, Vulnerability, and Oppression\n\nThe idea that manipulation can be a tool for the powerful to oppress\nthe less powerful is not new, even if the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d has not always been used to express it.\nMarxian notions of ideology and false consciousness as mechanisms that\nfacilitate the exploitation of workers by capital clearly resemble the\nconcept of manipulation as it is being used here. (Allen Wood explores\nsome of these connections in Wood 2014.) More recently, the concept of\n\u201cgas lighting\u201d has become a common feature of feminist\ntheorizing about how the patriarchy manipulates women into doubting\ntheir own judgments about reality. On a smaller scale, a bevy of\nself-help books focus on how manipulative tactics can be used to\ncreate and maintain subordination within relationships (Braiker 2004;\nSimon 2010; Kole 2016).\n\nA relative lack of socio-political power is almost certainly one\nsource of vulnerability to manipulation. But there are likely others\nas well. The trickery model of manipulation suggests that people who\nare less intellectually sophisticated are especially vulnerable to\ntrickery and therefore to manipulation. The pressure model suggests\nthat financial, social, and emotional desperation may make one\nespecially vulnerable to pressures created by threats to worsen an\nalready tenuous situation. Moreover, some forms of manipulation, like\nso-called \u201cnegging\u201d (tactic 6) and gaslighting\n (tactic 8)\n may work to increase the target\u2019s vulnerability to further\nmanipulation.\n\nHowever, it may also be true that manipulation is a tempting tool for\nuse by the vulnerable against the powerful. As Patricia Greenspan\nnotes,\n\n\nmanipulation is often recommended as a strategy particularly for\nwomen, or simply is treated as characteristic of women, at least in a\nworld where women cannot act openly to achieve their ends. A further\nargument for manipulation in these cases appeals to the limits on what\nis possible in a position of subordination. (Greenspan 2003: 156)\n\n\nSimilarly, Len Bowers observes that\n\n\nit is possible to interpret manipulation as a normal response to\nincarceration, rather than as being a pathological style of\nbehavior,\n\n\u2026\n\nmanipulative strategies may be viewed as a low-key way of fighting\nback at a system which has deprived the prisoner of normal freedom.\n(Bowers 2003: 330)\n\n\nFinally, it seems likely that one reason why children often resort to\nmanipulative tactics is that they often lack any other (or any other\nequally effective) way to get what they want.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the idea that the idea that manipulation\nundermines autonomous choice might itself be used, somewhat\nparadoxically, to undermine autonomous choice, especially among the\nnon-elite. This point is comes out forcefully in a comment by Sarah\nSkwire (2015, Other Internet Resources) on George Akerlof and Robert\nShiller\u2019s book, Phishing for Phools (Akerlof &\nShiller 2015). Akerlof and Shiller discuss a number of advertising,\nsales, and marketing practices that they deem manipulative. Skwire\nsuggests that the reason why Akerlof and Shiller call these practices\nmanipulative is that consumers subjected to them make choices that\nAkerlof and Shiller think are sufficiently irrational that they would\nonly be made under the influence of manipulation. Skwire writes that\nthis approach to detecting manipulation demonstrates \u201ccontempt\nfor the decisions made by people who are poorer and from a lower\nsocial class than the authors\u201d (Skwire 2015, Other Internet\nResources). In short, she suggests that Akerlof and Shiller are too\nquick to suspect manipulation in cases where people make different\ndecisions from the ones they think best. Whether or not we agree with\nSkwire\u2019s criticisms of Akerlof and Shiller, her point serves as\na cautionary one: Even if we accept that manipulation undermines\nautonomous choice, we must be careful not to use that as a reason to\nsuspect that people who make different choices from what we think are\nbest must therefore be victims of manipulation. It would be\nironic\u2014and unjust\u2014to use the idea that manipulation is a\nwrongful interference with autonomy as a weapon to delegitimize the\nautonomous choices of people with whom we disagree or whose\nsituations, needs, and values we do not understand.\n",
