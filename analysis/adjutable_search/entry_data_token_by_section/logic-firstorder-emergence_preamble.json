    "main_text": "\n\nFor anybody schooled in modern logic, first-order logic can seem an\nentirely natural object of study, and its discovery inevitable. It is\nsemantically complete; it is adequate to the axiomatization of all\nordinary mathematics; and Lindstr\u00f6m\u2019s theorem shows that it\nis the maximal logic satisfying the compactness and\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem properties. So it is not surprising that\nfirst-order logic has long been regarded as the \u201cright\u201d\nlogic for investigations into the foundations of mathematics. It\noccupies the central place in modern textbooks of mathematical logic,\nwith other systems relegated to the sidelines. The history, however,\nis anything but straightforward, and is certainly not a matter of a\nsudden discovery by a single researcher. The emergence is bound up\nwith technical discoveries, with differing conceptions of what\nconstitutes logic, with different programs of mathematical research,\nand with philosophical and conceptual reflection. So if first-order\nlogic is \u201cnatural\u201d, it is natural only in retrospect. The\nstory is intricate, and at points contested; the following entry can\nonly provide an overview. Discussions of various aspects of the\ndevelopment are provided by Goldfarb 1979, Moore 1988, Eklund 1996,\nBrady 2000, Ferreir\u00f3s 2001, Sieg 2009, Mancosu, Zach &\nBadesa 2010, Schiemer & Reck 2013, the notes to Hilbert [LFL], and\nthe encyclopedic handbook Gabbay & Woods 2009.\n",
