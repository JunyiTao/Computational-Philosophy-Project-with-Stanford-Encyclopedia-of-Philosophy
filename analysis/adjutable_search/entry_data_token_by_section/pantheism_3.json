    "main_text": "Nature of the identity relation itself\n4. Nature of the identity relation itself\n\nTo say that God is identical with the world as a whole is not\nself-explanatory and, although often the matter is left\ndisconcertingly vague, examination of the literature reveals a variety\nof different understandings of the identity relation being asserted\nhere.\n\n(1) Substance identity. For Spinoza the claim that God is the\nsame as the cosmos is spelled out as the thesis that there exists one\nand only one particular substance which he refers to as \u2018God or\nnature\u2019; the individual thing referred to as \u2018God\u2019\nis one and the same object as the complex unit referred to as\n\u2018nature\u2019 or \u2018the cosmos.\u2019 On such a scheme the\nfinite things of the world are thought of as something like\nparts of the one great substance, although the terminology of\nparts is somewhat problematic. Parts are relatively autonomous from\nthe whole and from each other, and Spinoza\u2019s preferred\nterminology of modes, which are to be understood as more like\nproperties, is chosen to rectify this. A further problem with the\nterminology of parts is that many pantheists have wanted to claim that\nGod or nature is not just the whole or totality of things, but is\nsomehow the inner essence or heart of each individual thing.\nThis may be expressed in the idea that somehow the whole is present in\neach of its parts, a suggestion whose meaning has often been left\nmetaphorical or obscure. Giordano Bruno, for example employs the two\nillustrations of a voice heard in its entirety from all sides of the\nroom, and that of a large mirror which reflects one image of one thing\nbut which, if it is broken into a thousand pieces, each of the pieces\nstill reflects the whole image (Bruno 1584, 50, 129). A thesis of the\ncomplete interpenetration or interrelation of everything, the claim\nbeing made here is related to that defended by Leibniz (who was not a\npantheist) that each monad is a mirror to the entire universe.\n\nIn Western philosophy Spinoza\u2019s formulation of the pantheistic\nposition has become so influential as to almost completely define the\nposition, but while practically all pantheists are monists (of some\nsort), not all are substance monists, and there do exist\nalternative ways of expressing identity besides a head-count of the\nnumber of particular entities.\n\n(2) Being itself. There is a long theological tradition in\nwhich God is regarded as being itself, rather than as one\nbeing among others, and insofar as it treats God as something to be\nfound inseparable from and at the very root of all that is, such a\nconception may be used to express pantheism. While a conceptual\ndistinction may be drawn between \u2018the totality of beings\u2019\nand \u2018being itself,\u2019 it is clear that neither of these\ncould have any reality except in and through the other. The\nidentification of God with being itself is a common Christian view,\nfrom Augustine to Tillich, but it is not exclusive to Christian\nthought. For example, Ibn \u2018Arabi, in developing the Koranic\nnotion of tawh\u012bd (God\u2019s unity), asserts that there\ncan be no real being other than God; that God permeates through all\nbeings and is essentially all things. Especially among his\nfollowers this was developed into a monistic ontology of wahdat\nal-wuj\u016bd (the unity of being).\n\n(3) Identity of origin. A third way to express the identity\nof God and nature is by reference to the thought that all things come\nfrom God, rendering them both identical with each other and with the\none source from which they came. It is important in this connection to\ndiscuss the difference between such notions as emanation, expression,\nor instantiation and the more specifically theistic conception of\ncreation ex nihilo, for given the plausibility of supposing\nthat what \u2018flows forth\u2019 or \u2018radiates out\u2019 from\na source is only latent within that stem, traditional theists have\noften insisted on creation ex nihilo precisely to drive a\nwedge between creator and created and thereby rule out pantheism. But\nalthough it would be tempting to contrast creation ex nihio\nas theistic and emanation as pantheistic, such thoughts are probably\ntoo simple. Plotinus\u2019 universe comprises in a hierarchy of\nemanations from what he terms, the \u2018One\u2019; but as neither\nanything in the cosmos nor the sum of all things in the cosmos, as an\nideal construction from which all expressions fall short,\nPlotinus\u2019 God is really too transcendent for his doctrine to\ncount as pantheism proper (see Steinhart 2019). Eriugena, by contrast,\nhas an emanation-theory that is more genuinely pantheist but, given\nhis apophatic conception of God as marked by both being and non-being,\nhe regards this position as wholly compatible with the doctrine of\ncreation ex nihilo. To Eriugena, God is precisely the nothing\nfrom which all things were made. Spinoza approaches the question of\norigin from a rather different angle. Arguing that God is the immanent\ncause of all things, he draws an important distinction between\nnatura naturans and natura naturata; between the\nuniverse considered in active mode as cause and the very same universe\nconsidered in passive mode as effect (Ethics 1p29s). This is\nan important doctrine not least for the way in which it links with\nnecessity. Modelled more on the way in which the theorems of geometry\nderive from its axioms than on the sense in which a work of art\nresults from the free or spontaneous activity of its artist,\npantheistic creation of this second type courts a determinism that\nthreatens to rule out free will. And that has been a very common\nobjection to pantheism.\n\n(4) Teleological Identity. Religious world views in which it\nis the ultimate destiny or purpose of the cosmos to achieve oneness\nwith or to fully express deity provide a fourth model for\nunderstanding pantheistic claims of identity. The true identity of the\nuniverse is that which is revealed at the end of all things. For\nexample, on the Absolute Idealist scheme, history culminates in the\ncomplete realization of God or Absolute spirit in the world and so, as\nSchelling put it, in the last days \u201cGod will indeed be all\nin all, and pantheism will be true\u201d (Schelling 1810, 484).\nA rather different example of this type of thinking is that of Samuel\nAlexander who thinks that the universe evolves in a steadily\nprogressive manner and will finally \u2018attain deity\u2019, where\ndeity is thought of as an unknown but superior quality that will\n\u2018emerge\u2019 from the complex whole in rather the same way as,\nat a lower level, consciousness \u2018emerges\u2019 from complex\norganisations of organic matter. By way of objection to such\nteleological conception of identity it might be challenged that\nsomething can only become merged with God, or become God, if it is\nnow different from God. But against this it could be replied\nthat, if the notion of teleology be taken seriously, a thing more\ntruly is what it is destined to become than what it\ncurrently seems to be, for everything about it is to be\nexplained in terms of its telos or goal. It may also be\nresponded that anything which can be converted into God\ncannot be finally different from God. Hence Alexander, for\nexample, is clear that since all potentiality must be grounded in some\nactuality there is also a sense in which the universe is already\nimplicitly God: \u201cGod as actually possessing deity does not exist\nbut is an ideal, is always becoming; but God as the whole universe\ntending towards deity does exist\u201d (Alexander 1921, 428).\n",
