We might judge that prizing another\u2019s suffering is\ndespicable, apart from its consequences. Dewey rejected the sharp\ndistinction between character and action, motive and consequence, that\nthis picture presupposes. A character trait is a tendency to pursue\ncertain ends, and so must be appraised in terms of its typical\n(intended) results. Thus, we condemn schadenfreude primarily because\nit leads to cruelty. At the same time, conduct has among its\nconsequences a tendency to reinforce the character traits that caused\nthem, or to consolidate into a character trait its direction of\nimpulse. Conduct constitutes the moral self. So, we properly condemn a\nsingle manifestation of schadenfreude \u2014 say, laughing at\nsuffering caused by a natural disaster \u2014 even if it, in itself,\ndid nothing to increase anyone\u2019s suffering. This is the truth\nthat moralities of intention grasp, which narrowly consequentialist\ntheories do not (E 173\u20135, 286\u20139).\n\nOne who holds that evil attitudes can be bad in themselves, apart from\ntheir consequences, would want to say more than this. Dewey can say\nmore, too. He would agree that we do not value attitudes only\ninstrumentally. We immediately prize some attitudes and despise\nothers, in the sense that we directly prize and despise them without\nfirst appraising them instrumentally. A sympathetic person immediately\nhates expressions of schadenfreude without first checking whether they\nactually caused anyone to suffer. Such valuings can themselves be\nsubject to appraisal. If we endorse them upon reflection on their\nconsequences, we judge that they are merited (see the section on\n Virtue Theories\n below). Among the most important consequences of such second-order\nvaluings are their impact on our characters: they tend to reinforce\nthe attitudes that are prized, and make us recoil from the attitudes\nthat are despised, leading us to seek means to change those attitudes.\nDewey denies that there is any sensible way to appraise character\ntraits apart from their typical consequences. So there is no getting\naway from consequences altogether. However, his theory has the\nresources to (a) condemn particular manifestations of bad attitudes,\neven when they do not have their typically bad direct consequences,\n(b) immediately (\u201cintrinsically\u201d) despise them, (c) judge\nthat such immediate condemnations are warranted, and thereby (d)\nconstitute new, reflective and cognitively loaded\naffective-ideational-motor attitudes of condemnation. His theory can\nmake parallel claims for prizings and appraisals of good\nattitudes.\n\nThus, we begin with immediate valuings or prizings of things. Such\nprizings have no cognitive content. When we ask whether something\nought to be valued, we enter the domain of appraisal or value\njudgments. To appraise something is to judge it in relation to the\nmeans required to attain it, and as a means or cause of further\nconsequences. Appraisal, then, is fundamentally about means. However,\nsuch appraisals transform our original prizings. If we discover that\nthe cost of attaining something prized is too high, we prize it less\n(reduce or eliminate our tendency to go after it). If we discover that\nattaining it has further, disvalued, consequences, we also prize it\nless. If attaining it has further, prized consequences, or if the\nmeans to attain it are themselves prized, we value it even more. Now\nthe valuing has cognitive content, and is articulately directed to\nthat content. Now we value or disvalue something under a description\n(the ice cream as cause of stomach ailment, the suit as stylish and\nimpressive to prospective employers, the schadenfreude as despicable).\nThe appraisal of things as means feeds back into our prizing of things\nas ends.\n",
