    "main_text": "Gamification || Logic Games\n6.1 Logic Games\n\nMany notions in logic have been analyzed in game-theoretic terms\n\nEvaluation games There are well-known two-player\ngames for evaluating a first-order formula \\(\\varphi\\) within a given\nlogical model. These games are played between Verifier and Falsifier,\nwho can both test atomic assertions, and specify the value of\nvariables from a given domain (Hintikka\n1973). The schedule of the game is determined from the\nsyntactic structure of the formula \\(\\varphi\\). Disjunctions and\nexistential quantifiers require choices of the Verifier, conjunctions\nand universal quantifiers of the Falsifier, and negations trigger a\nrole switch between the two players. The result is the following match\nbetween winning strategies and the ordinary semantic notion of\ntruth:\n\n\nFormula \\(\\varphi\\) is true in model M under assignment\ns iff the Verifier has a winning strategy in the associated\ngame \\(game(M, s, \\varphi)\\). \n\n\nCorrespondingly, Falsifier has a winning strategy if the formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) is false in the model. Evaluation games turn out to be an\nextremely flexible tool. By suitably modulating rules and winning\nconventions, adequate evaluation games can be found for most logical\nsystems. Doing so, however, can be a highly non-trivial task, as\nwitnessed by the intricate infinite \u2018parity games\u2019\ncorresponding to fixed-point logics such as the modal \u03bc-calculus\n(Venema 2008). For the present purpose,\nit should be noted that this style of analysis ties the very logical\noperations, conjunctions, disjunctions, modal operators, to natural\nmoves in a game. Similarly, the notion of truth is linked to the\nfundamental game-theoretic notion of a strategy in an extensive form\ngame (cf.\n Section 2):\n a complex, structured object which may here be understood as a reason\nor an explanation for the truth or falsity of the formula.\n\nThe links between both perspectives are so close, that valid\nprinciples of logic come to express game-theoretic facts. For\ninstance, after a little analysis, the law of excluded middle implies\nthat always either Verifier or Falsifier has a winning strategy, cf.\n Section 2.4.\n In other words, logical evaluation games for classical logic are\ndetermined in the game-theoretic sense. In fact, This property extends\nto most games for non-classical logics.\n\nFurther logic games Logic games exist for many other\npurposes. Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games serve model comparison\n(Ehrenfeucht 1961; Ebbinghaus & Flum\n1995), Lorenzen games perform proof analysis (Kamlah\n1973 [1984]) and tableau games execute\nmodel construction (Hodges 1985). In\neach case, strategies in the game match important logical notions. In\nLorenzen dialogue games, for instance, winning strategies for the\nProponent of a claim correspond to proofs of that claim from premises\ngranted by the Opponent, whereas winning strategies for the Opponent\nare constructions of counter-models. Thus, proofs and models, two\nquite distinct notions in logic, co-exist within a single game.\n\nThere exists an alternative, game-theoretic way of interpreting these\nconnective results. Suppose the game under study is fixed, and\nassociated with some sort of \u2018game board\u2019 representing\nmajor features of the game\u2019s general state (think of Chess,\nthough more abstract game boards may occur). Then the above\nequivalences suggest that winning strategies, i.e., a typical\ngame-theoretic notion defined in terms of the complete extensive game\ntree, is equivalent to a simpler \u2018invariant\u2019 that can be\ndefined entirely in terms of some game board associated with the\ntree\u2019s nodes. Identifying useful such invariants is a well-known\nart in the analysis of concrete games. In terms of a main theme of\nthis entry, invariants can live at different levels of representation\nassociated with a given class of games.\n\nGame semantics One can view logic games as mere\ndidactic devices analyzing logical notions that were already\nwell-understood. Or, in other terms, as offering a concrete way of\nteaching logic that draws on game-theoretic intuitions. However, logic\ngames have more to offer. First of all, new logics are suggested by\npursuing natural variations in winning conventions, moves, or\nscheduling within existing logic games. Moreover, viewing logical\noperations as game constructors suggests a new, refined view on\nlogical constants. Conjunction, for instance, now splits naturally\ninto a sequential and a parallel version. Similar examples of\nparallelism also exist in logics of computation. Moreover, associating\nquantifiers with object picking, as in evaluation games, turns\nquantifiers into special types of atomic games that connect to the\nfollowing formula by an abstract operation of game composition. The\ngeneral logic of this abstract composition operation combined with\npropositional operations of choice and switch has been shown\ndecidable, providing a new decidable core logic inside first-order\nlogic whose existence had not been suspected (van\nBenthem 2014). Games, hence, can offer a\nfresh perspective on existing logical systems.\n\nA major source of independent, game-theoretic perspectives on logic is\nthe game semantics of computational logics (Abramsky\n1997). In this setting, the status\nof logic games may change. Rather than being a mere pedagogical or\nexploratory device, to some, these games are considered the true\nmeaning of logical constants. In this setting, infinite games are\noften the paradigm, standing for ongoing processes, rather than finite\nterminating games. This shows in the importance of infinite parity\ngames for the modal \u03bc-calculus, Venema\n(2008), as well as in the earlier-mentioned co-algebraic\nperspective on games. Baltag, van Benthem &\nWesterst\u00e5hl (forthcoming) discuss the outside-in\nperspective of co-algebraic game semantics as a viable general\nparadigm for linguistic meaning representing a significant shift in\nstandard discussions of compositionality.\n\n",
