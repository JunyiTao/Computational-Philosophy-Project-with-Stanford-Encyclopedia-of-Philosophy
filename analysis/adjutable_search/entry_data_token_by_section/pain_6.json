    "main_text": "Perceptual theories\n3. Perceptual theories\n\nBecause sense-datum theories are most plausible when applied to\nintransitive bodily sensations, many philosophers, who believe that a\nnaturalist account of ordinary perception can be given without\nintroducing sense-data, have attempted to understand pains and other\nbodily sensations as species of ordinary perception (exteroception).\nThe so-called perceptual theories of pain are advanced and defended on\nthe hope that pains and other intransitive bodily sensations, contrary\nto first appearances, are species of information gathering which work\non the same principles that govern other sensory modalities for which\na successful direct realist account can be given.\n",
