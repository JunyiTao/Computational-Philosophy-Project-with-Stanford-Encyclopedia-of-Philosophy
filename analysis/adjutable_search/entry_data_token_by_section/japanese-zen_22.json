    "main_text": "Returning to the Everyday Lifeworld: Not One || Zen\u2019s Freedom\n8.2 Zen\u2019s Freedom\n\nHow then does the Zen person, thus understood, live freedom? The term\nthat Zen uses to express the idea of \u201cfreedom\u201d is\n\u201cjiy\u016b\u201d and it consists of two characters:\n\u201cji\u201d meaning \u201cself on its own,\u201d while\n\u201cy\u016b\u201d means \u201cout of.\u201d When they\nare used together as a compound, the phrase as a whole designates an\naction arising out of self on its own. This action then\ncarries a sense of spontaneity, much like the spontaneous\ncreative act of living nature. This idea of freedom is foreign to the\nWestern intellectual tradition, however. For example, consider how\nfreedom is defined by British empiricists like John Locke. According\nto Locke, freedom (or to be specific, liberty) is defined as a lack or\nabsence of external constraint. According to this model, freedom is to\nexpress an ego-desire save in the name of will arising from an\nindividual in \u201cthe state of nature\u201d where and when there\nis no external constraint. By contrast, because it arises out of the\nself on its own, where the self in Zen is a groundless ground that is\nnothing, Zen\u2019s free action is not delimited by ego-desire,\nbecause it arises out of nothing. It \u201ckicks through the bottom\nof the bucket,\u201d that is, it purifies all the\n\u201cdefilements\u201d interlaced with the activity of the\nego-consciousness, as well as the personal and collective unconscious.\nFor this reason, there is no issue involved in the Zen person\u2019s\naction that addresses the will of ego-consciousness. For what\nmotivates the Zen person to action is a thrust he or she\nfeels, surging from the creative source in the bottomless ground.\nMoreover, the Zen person does not experience, as Nietzsche has it,\n\u201cbad-faith\u201d or \u201cself-deception\u201d when\nexplaining a motivation for action as a rationalist would, because a\nrationalist must rationalize an irrational desire rooted in the body\nand the unconscious. (See, for example, Nietzsche\u2019s Beyond\nGood and Evil.)\n\nDoes this mean then that the Zen person has eliminated the demand of\ninstincts or desires? If they are eliminated, the Zen person\nwould turn into a living corpse. Such a person can perform no action,\nlet alone a free action. Obviously then, the Zen person does\nnot eliminate them, but rather transforms them into\n\u201cnon-defilements,\u201d into a higher spiritual energy. We see\na heightened spirituality upheld by Zen master Baso (Chin.,\nM\u00e4z\u016b; 709\u2013788), which he insists to be concretely\nexpressed in the everyday lifeworld. He expresses it by\nphrasing it as \u201cthe mind as it is is the way.\u201d (Yanagita,\n1974, 147.) This statement, \u201cthe mind as it is is the Way\u201d\n(heij\u014dshin kore michi) is sometimes rendered in English\nas \u201cthe everyday mind is the Way.\u201d This rendition can be\nmisleading if we ignore Baso\u2019s qualification that this\n\u201ceveryday mind\u201d operates without defilements such that it\nis not \u201c[entrenched in the sams\u0101ric cycle] of\nbirth and death,\u201d and moreover that it is not dominated by a\nteleological intentionality, i.e., it negates the \u201cin order\nthat.\u201d Otherwise, there is a danger of interpreting Baso\u2019s\nstatement as promoting an evil naturalism. That is, whatever a person\ndesires in the state of \u201cnature,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe\neveryday mind,\u201d is the expression of the Way. There is no\nproblem of a misinterpretation then, as long as Baso\u2019s\n\u201ceveryday mind\u201d is understood to mean the mind which is\nfreed from \u201cthe sams\u0101sric cycle of birth and\ndeath,\u201d and yet it is the mind which is concretely instantiated\nin the everydayness of a human everyday lifeworld. \n\nLet us see how Baso\u2019s idea of \u201cthe mind as it is is the\nWay\u201d is carried to a highly artistic action, whether it be a\nperformance technique of martial artist, dancer, actor/actress or\nmusician. Takuan\u2019s reflection on this point is illuminating. He\nspeaks of a \u201cnondiscriminatory knowledge\u201d realized in\naction as \u201cimmovable wisdom\u201d: \u201cIt [immovable wisdom]\nmoves as the mind is wont to move: forward or back, to the left, to\nthe right, in the ten directions and to the eight points; and the mind\nthat does not stop at all is called immovable wisdom.\u201d (Takuan,\n1986.) Zen\u2019s free action is predicated on the fact that the mind\n\u201cdoes not stop at all,\u201d what Takuan paradoxically calls\n\u201cimmovable wisdom.\u201d Here one can discern an echo of\nJinne\u2019s mirror analogy. Takuan calls it \u201cimmovable\u201d\nbecause the mind remains absolutely still (i.e., not two) in the\nmidst of action, like the stationary shaft of a top. Such a\nmind does not fluctuate in its center, in the deep region of\npsyche. In this state, because the mind moves in such a way\nthat it does not dwell on anything, there is no obstruction for the\nmind to move freely. \n\nGenerally Zen describes the freedom of bodily movement as\n\u201cstillness in motion\u201d (d\u014dch\u016b no\nsei) and is contrasted with \u201cmotion in stillness.\u201d It\nis noteworthy that \u201cstillness in motion\u201d cannot accurately\nbe analyzed by appealing to the active-passive scheme, which\npresupposes a dichotomy as a proper method for understanding. However\ncontradictory it may seem, this is a description of how Zen\nunderstands its freedom as expressed through an integrated mind and\nbody. In order for this sense of freedom to be embodied, however, Zen\nemphasizes that a performer of any kind repeatedly undergoes mind-body\ntraining. Takuan calls this the \u201cbody\u2019s\nlearning,\u201d\u2014that is the core meaning of\nself-cultivation\u2014because in the \u201cbody\u2019s\nlearning,\u201d both the mind and the body are brought to action in\none integrated whole. (The \u201cbody\u2019s learning,\u201d\nneurophysiologically speaking, is closely related to an activity of\nthe cerebellum in conjunction with the hippocampus, although it is not\nonly that.) When a skill or performing technique is learned through\nthis method, one\u2019s own body moves freely as it is habituated to\nmove without waiting for a command from the mind. This describes a\nfreedom of action in a Zen person for whom the mind is completely\nassimilated into the object-body, while the body is equally rendered\ninto the subject-body. They are one. At such a time, Takuan says, a\nspiritual life-energy of psychophysiological nature, called\n\u201cki,\u201d permeates \u201cone\u2019s\nbody\u201d\u2014an energy that cannot be delineated by either the\nmind or the body (Yuasa, 1993). In this connection, Zen also speaks of\nZen\u2019s free action as a purposeless purpose, as an actionless\naction, for neither the purpose nor the action arises from the\neveryday consciousness which sets up a purpose or a goal for action.\nZen calls it \u201csam\u0101dhi-at-play,\u201d where there\nis no individual qua the trans-individual, but what there is\nis just \u201cplay,\u201d for the Zen person is absorbed in\nthe activity when engaging a thing of the everyday\nlifeworld. In short, Zen freedom designates a term of\nachievement. What Zen says about freedom of action has an\nimplication for every action people perform in daily life, from the\nsimple act of opening a door to the magnificent play of a great\nathlete or performer of any kind. In them, Zen contends however, the\nspirituality of a performer must be expressed. Zen extends an\ninvitation to all of us to act in this way, so that our quality of\nlife will be enhanced with a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment,\nfree from stress and anxiety.\n",
