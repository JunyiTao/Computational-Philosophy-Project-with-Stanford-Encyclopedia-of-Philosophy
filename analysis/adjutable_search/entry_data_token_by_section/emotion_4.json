The Early Evaluative Tradition in Philosophy: Emotions as Judgments \n\nEvaluative theories of emotions, a.k.a. cognitive theories of\nemotions, became popular in both philosophy and affective science\nroughly in the 1960s and come in many flavors. A key distinction is\nthat between constitutive and causal evaluative\ntheories. Constitutive theories state that emotions are\ncognitions or evaluations of particular kinds, whereas causal theories\nstate that emotions are caused by cognitions or evaluations\nof particular kinds. The constitutive approach tends to be dominant in\nphilosophy, while the causal approach enjoys significant support in\npsychology. Let us consider these two strands of cognitivism in\nturn.\n\nThe emergence of the constitutive approach in philosophy in the middle\nof the twentieth century can be traced to a pair of articles by C.D.\nBroad (1954) and Errol Bedford (1957), and a book by Anthony Kenny\n(1963) (see also Pitcher 1965; Thalberg 1964). These authors were not\nthe first to emphasize that emotions are object-directed or endowed\nwith intentionality\u2014Brentano (1874 [1995]) had already done so\nwith inspiration from various medieval authors (King 2010). But these\nmid-twentieth century philosophers were the first to articulate an\ninfluential argument to the effect that, in order to account for their\nintentionality, emotions must be cognitive evaluations of some kind\nrather than feelings (see also Meinong 1894).\n\nThe argument goes roughly like this. If emotions have intentionality,\nit follows that there are internal standards of appropriateness\naccording to which an emotion is appropriate just in case its formal\nobject is instantiated (Kenny 1963). But feelings are not the kinds of\nthings that can enter into conceptual relations with formal objects.\nSo, to be properly embedded in conceptual relations of this sort,\nemotions need to be or involve \u201ccognitive evaluations\u201d of\nsome kind. \n\nWhat kinds of cognitive evaluations? The most parsimonious type of\ncognitivist theory follows the Stoics in identifying emotions with\njudgments. Robert Solomon (1980), Jerome Neu (2000) and Martha\nNussbaum (2001) take this approach. On a common interpretation of\ntheir view, my anger at someone is the judgment that I have been\nwronged by that person. To generalize, the proposal is that an emotion\nE is a judgment that the formal object of E is\ninstantiated (by some particular object X).\n\nThis theory is often referred to as judgmentalism, but the\nlabel is potentially misleading, because it suggests that for the\ntheory\u2019s proponents an emotion is nothing but a judgment,\nunderstood as an assent to a proposition. This interpretation is\nindeed presupposed by some of the standard critiques of\njudgmentalism.\n\nFirst, it is argued that judgmentalism does not explain how emotions\ncan motivate, because one can hold a judgment\u2014say the judgment\nthat I have been wronged\u2014without being motivated to act on it.\nSecond, it does not explain the phenomenology of emotions, because\nholding a judgment lacks the bodily, valence and arousal dimensions\nthat typically characterize the experience of emotion. Third, it fails\nto account for the emotions of animals and infants, who arguably lack\nthe capacity of assenting to propositions (Deigh 1994). Fourth, it\ndoes not explain the \u201crecalcitrance to reason\u201d some\nemotions display when they are not extinguished by judgments that\ncontradict them, as when someone judges that flying is not dangerous\nbut continues to be afraid of it (D\u2019Arms & Jacobson\n2003).\n\nJudgmentalists have tried to address these critiques by clarifying\nwhat sorts of judgments emotions are (and some, like Nussbaum and Neu,\nhave explicitly rejected the label of judgmentalism). It has been\nargued for instance that we should think of judgments as\n\u201cenclosing a core desire\u201d (Solomon 2003: 105\u2013106),\nwhich makes them motivational (e.g., fear encloses the core desire to\nflee). Such judgments are also \u201cdynamic\u201d and able to\n\u201chouse\u2026the disorderly motions of emotion\u201d (Nussbaum\n2001: 45), and thus phenomenologically salient; since they involve\npre-linguistic and non-linguistic acceptance of how the world seems,\nthey are available to infants and animals; finally, as they are\ncapable of being held jointly with contradictory judgments, they can\nexplain recalcitrance to reason (Nussbaum 2001).\n\nSeveral objections have been launched against this strategy. Just to\npick a prominent example among many, it has been argued is that\nexplaining recalcitrance to reason in terms of contradictory\njudgments\u2014judging that p and that\nnot-p\u2014ascribes to agents the wrong kind of irrationality\n(Helm 2001, 2015; see also D\u00f6ring 2008; Benbaji 2012; Brady 2009;\nTappolet 2000, Faucher & Tappolet 2008a, b). There may be a broader\nproblem at work here, namely that judgmentalists stretch the meaning\nof the concept of \u201cjudgment\u201d in an unprincipled way to\naccount for all counterexamples, instead of distinguishing between\nimportantly different types of cognitive states all subsumed under the\nsame heading.\n\nThe trouble with this elastic strategy is not only that it is\nad hoc, but also that it creates cross-purpose talk and ultimately\namounts to a pyrrhic victory for the evaluative theory, because, on a\nsufficiently expanded notion of judgment, the identification of\nemotions with judgments becomes at best trivially true and fails to\nshed light on what emotions are (Scarantino 2010).\n\nTwo more promising strategies have been put in place to defend\ncognitivism from counterexamples. The first, which we call the\njudgmentalist add-on strategy (Goldie 2000), consists of\nexplicitly adding on to judgments other components of emotions, rather\nthan embedding them into judgments through the elastic strategy. For\ninstance, the motivational dimension of emotions has been accounted\nfor by suggesting that emotions are not just judgments, but rather\ncombinations of judgments (or beliefs) and desires (Marks 1982; Green\n1992; Gordon 1987). Other authors have added further elements,\nproposing that emotions are combinations of judgments, desires and\nfeelings, a move intended to account for both motivational and\nphenomenological dimensions of emotions (Lyons 1980).\n\nAnother strategy, which may be called the alternate cognitions\nstrategy, consists of replacing the broad notion of judgment with\na variety of other types of cognitive evaluations that can account for\nthe intentionality of emotions while avoiding some of the critiques\nthat have been raised against judgmentalism. Since most of the action\nin contemporary philosophy of emotions focuses on which alternate\ncognitions are to be preferred, we will devote a whole section to the\ntopic. First, we discuss how the Evaluative Tradition has been\ndeveloped in affective science.\n",
