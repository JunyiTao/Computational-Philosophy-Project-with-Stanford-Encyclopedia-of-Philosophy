Carnap, for example, in\n\u201cIntroductory Remarks\u201d (Carnap 1956 [Reichenbach 1958:\nvii]) to the posthumous English translation of this work, singled it\nout on account of its \u201cgreat interest for the methodology of\nphysics\u201d. Reichenbach himself deemed \u201cthe philosophical\nachievement of the theory of relativity\u201d to lie in this\nmethodological distinction between conventional and factual claims\nregarding spacetime geometry (1928: 24 [1958: 15]), and he boasted of\nhis \u201cphilosophical theory of relativity\u201d as an\nincontrovertible \u201cphilosophical result\u201d:\n\n\nthe philosophical theory of relativity, i.e., the discovery\nof the definitional character of the metric in all its details, holds\nindependently of experience.\u2026 a philosophical result not\nsubject to the criticism of the individual sciences. (1928: 223 [1958:\n177])\n\n\nYet this result is neither incontrovertible nor an untrammeled\nconsequence of Einstein\u2019s theory of gravitation. There is, first\nof all, the shadowy status accorded to universal forces. A sympathetic\nreading (e.g., Dieks 1987) suggests that the notion serves usefully in\nmediating between a traditional a priori commitment to\nEuclidean geometry and the view of modern geometrodynamics, where\ngravitational force is \u201cgeometrized away\u201d (see\n \u00a75).\n After all, as Reichenbach explicitly acknowledged, gravitation is\nitself a universal force, coupling to all bodies and affecting them in\nthe same manner (1928: 294\u20136 [1958: 256\u20138]). Hence the\nchoice recommended by descriptive simplicity is merely a stipulation\nthat infinitesimal metrical appliances be considered as\n\u201cdifferentially at rest\u201d in an inertial system (1924: 115\n[1969: 147]). This is a stipulation that spacetime measurements always\ntake place in regions that are to be considered small Minkowski\nspacetimes (arenas of gravitation-free physics). By the same token,\nconsistency then required an admission that \u201cthe transition from\nthe special theory to the general one represents merely a renunciation\nof metrical characteristics\u201d (1924: 115 [1969: 147]), or, even\nmore pointedly, that \u201call the metrical properties of the\nspacetime continuum are destroyed by gravitational fields\u201d where\nonly topological properties remain (1928: 308 [1958: 268\u20139]). To\nbe sure, these bizarre conclusions are supposed to be rendered more\npalatable in connection with the epistemological reduction of\nspacetime structures in the causal theory of time.\n\nDespite the influence of this argument on the subsequent generation of\nphilosophers of science, Reichenbach\u2019s analysis of spacetime\nmeasurement is plainly inappropriate, manifesting a fallacious\ntendency to view the generically curved spacetimes of general\nrelativity as stitched together from little bits of flat Minskowski\nspacetimes. Besides being mathematically inconsistent, this procedure\noffers no way of providing a non-metaphorical physical meaning for the\nfundamental metrical tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\), the central theoretical\nconcept of general relativity, nor to the series of curvature tensors\nderivable from it and its associated affine connection. Since these\nsectional curvatures at a point of spacetime are empirically\nmanifested and the curvature components can be measured, e.g., as the\ntidal forces of gravity, they can hardly be accounted as due to\nconventionally adopted \u201cuniversal forces\u201d. Furthermore,\nthe concept of an infinitesimal rigid rod in general relativity cannot\nreally be other than the interim stopgap Einstein recognized it to be.\nFor it cannot actually be rigid due to these tidal forces; in fact,\nthe concept of a rigid body is already forbidden in special relativity\nas allowing instantaneous causal actions. Moreover, such a rod must\nindeed be infinitesimal, i.e., a freely falling body of negligible\nthickness and of sufficiently short extension, so as to not be\nstressed by gravitational field inhomogeneities; just how short\ndepending on strength of local curvatures and on measurement error\n(Torretti 1983: 239). But then, as Reichenbach appeared to have\nrecognized in his comments about the \u201cdestruction\u201d of the\nmetric by gravitational fields, it cannot serve as a coordinately\ndefined general standard for metrical relations. In fact, as Weyl was\nthe first to point out, precisely which physical objects or structures\nare most suitable as measuring instruments should be decided on the\nbasis of gravitational theory itself. From this enlightened\nperspective, measuring rods and clocks are structures that are far too\nphysically complex. Rather, the metric in the region surrounding any\nobserver O can be empirically determined from freely falling ideally\nsmall neutral test masses together with the paths of light rays. More\nprecisely stated, the spacetime metric results from the\naffine-projective structure of the behavior of neutral test particles\nof negligible mass and from the conformal structure of light rays\nreceived and issued by the observer (Weyl 1921). Any purely\nconventional stipulation regarding the behavior of measuring rods as\nphysically constitutive of metrical relations in general relativity is\nthen otiose (Weyl 1923a; Ehlers, Pirani and Schild 1973; Geroch 1978).\nAlas, since Reichenbach reckoned the affine structure of the\ngravitational-inertial field to be just as conventional as its\nmetrical structure, he was not able to recognize this method as other\nthan an equivalent, but by no means necessarily preferable, account of\nthe empirical determination of the metric through the use of rods and\nclocks (Coffa 1979; Ryckman 2005: chs. 2 & 4; Giovanelli\n2013b).\n",
