    "main_text": "Ethics || The Human Being\n2.2 The Human Being\n\nIn Part Two, Spinoza turns to the nature of the human being. The two\nattributes of God of which we have knowledge are extension and\nthought. This, in itself, involves what would have been an astounding\nthesis in the eyes of his contemporaries, one that was usually\nmisunderstood and vilified. When Spinoza claims in Proposition Two\nthat \u201cExtension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended\nthing\u201d, he was almost universally\u2014but\nerroneously\u2014interpreted as saying that God is literally\ncorporeal. For just this reason, \u201cSpinozism\u201d became, for\nhis critics, synonymous with materialism.\n\nAccording to one interpretation, God is indeed material, even matter\nitself, but this does not imply that God is or has a body. Another\ninterpretation, however, one which will be adopted here, is that what\nis in God is not matter per se, but extension as an essence. And\nextension and thought are two distinct essences or natures that have\nabsolutely nothing in common. The modes or expressions of extension\nare physical bodies; the modes of thought are ideas. Because extension\nand thought have nothing in common, the two realms of matter and mind\nare causally closed systems. Everything that is extended follows from\nthe attribute of extension alone. Every bodily event is part of an\ninfinite causal series of bodily events and is determined only by the\nnature of extension and its laws, in conjunction with its relations to\nother extended bodies. Similarly, every idea or mental event follows\nonly from the attribute of thought. Any idea is an integral part of an\ninfinite series of ideas and is determined by the nature of thought\nand its laws, along with its relations to other ideas. There is, in\nother words, no causal interaction between bodies and ideas, between\nthe physical and the mental. There is, however, a thoroughgoing\ncorrelation and parallelism between the two series. For every mode in\nextension that is a relatively stable collection of matter (an\nindividual body), there is a corresponding mode in thought (an idea or\nmind). In fact, he insists, \u201ca mode of extension and the idea of\nthat mode are one and the same thing, but expressed in two ways\u201d\n(IIp7s). Because of the fundamental and underlying unity of Nature or\nSubstance and its attributes, thought and extension are just two\ndifferent ways in which one and the same Nature expresses itself.\nEvery material thing (every determinate expression of Nature through\nextension) thus has its own particular idea (a determinate expression\nof Nature through thought)\u2014an eternal adequate idea\u2014that\ncorresponds to and represents it. Since that idea is just a mode of\none of God\u2019s attributes\u2014thought\u2014it is in God, and\nthe infinite series of ideas constitutes God\u2019s mind or infinite\nintellect. As he explains,\n\nA circle existing in nature and the idea of the existing circle, which\nis also in God, are one and the same thing, which is explained through\ndifferent attributes. Therefore, whether we conceive nature under the\nattribute of Extension, or under the attribute of Thought, or under\nany other attribute, we shall find one and the same order, or one and\nthe same connection of causes, i.e., that the same things follow one\nanother. (IIp7s)\n\n\nIt follows from this, Spinoza argues, that the causal relations\nbetween bodies is mirrored in the logical relations between\nGod\u2019s ideas. Or, as Spinoza notes in Proposition Seven,\n\u201cthe order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and\nconnection of things\u201d.\n\nOne kind of extended body, however, is significantly more complex than\nany others in its composition and in its dispositions to act and be\nacted upon. That complexity is reflected in its corresponding idea.\nThe body in question is the human body; and its corresponding idea is\nthe human mind or soul. The human mind, then, like any other idea, is\nsimply one particular mode of God\u2019s attribute, thought. Whatever\nhappens in the body is reflected or expressed in the mind. In this\nway, the mind perceives, more or less obscurely, what is taking place\nin its body. And through its body\u2019s interactions with other\nbodies, the mind is aware of what is happening in the physical world\naround it. But the human mind no more interacts with its body than any\nmode of thought interacts with a mode of extension.\n\nOne of the pressing questions in seventeenth-century philosophy, and\nperhaps the most celebrated legacy of Descartes\u2019s dualism, is\nthe problem of how two radically different substances such as mind and\nbody enter into a union in a human being and cause effects in each\nother. How can the extended body causally engage the unextended mind,\nwhich is incapable of contact or motion, and \u201cmove\u201d it,\nthat is, cause mental effects such as pains, sensations and\nperceptions? And how can an immaterial thing like a mind or soul,\nwhich does not have motion, put a body (the human body) into motion?\nSpinoza, in effect, denies that the human being is a union of two\nsubstances. The human mind and the human body are two\ndifferent expressions\u2014under thought and under extension\u2014of\none and the same thing: the person. And because there is no causal\ninteraction between the mind and the body, the so-called mind-body\nproblem does not, technically speaking, arise.\n",
