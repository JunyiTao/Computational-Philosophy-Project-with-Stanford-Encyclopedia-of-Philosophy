    "main_text": "The Limits of Human Understanding\n2. The Limits of Human Understanding\n\nLocke is often classified as the first of the great English\nempiricists (ignoring the claims of Bacon and Hobbes). This reputation\nrests on Locke\u2019s greatest work, the monumental An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding. Locke explains his project in\nseveral places. Perhaps the most important of his goals is to\ndetermine the limits of human understanding. Locke writes:\n\n\nFor I thought that the first Step towards satisfying the several\nEnquiries, the Mind of Man was apt to run into, was, to take a Survey\nof our own Understandings, examine our own Powers, and see to what\nThings they were adapted. Till that was done, I suspected that we\nbegan at the wrong end, and in vain sought for Satisfaction in a quiet\nand secure Possession of Truths, that most concern\u2019d us whilst\nwe let loose our Thoughts into the vast Ocean of Being, as if\nall the boundless Extent, were the natural and undoubted Possessions\nof our Understandings, wherein there was nothing that escaped its\nDecisions, or that escaped its Comprehension. Thus Men, extending\ntheir Enquiries beyond their Capacities, and letting their Thoughts\nwander into those depths where they can find no sure Footing;\n\u2019tis no Wonder, that they raise Questions and multiply Disputes,\nwhich never coming to any clear Resolution, are proper to only\ncontinue and increase their Doubts, and to confirm them at last in a\nperfect Skepticism. Wheras were the Capacities of our Understanding\nwell considered, the Extent of our Knowledge once discovered, and the\nHorizon found, which sets the boundary between the enlightened and the\ndark Parts of Things; between what is and what is not comprehensible\nby us, Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the\navow\u2019d Ignorance of the one; and employ their Thoughts and\nDiscourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other. (I.1.7,\nN: 47)\n\n\nSome philosophers before Locke had suggested that it would be good to\nfind the limits of the Understanding, but what Locke does is to carry\nout this project in detail. In the four books of the Essay\nLocke considers the sources and nature of human knowledge. Book I\nargues that we have no innate knowledge. (In this he resembles\nBerkeley and Hume, and differs from Descartes and Leibniz.) So, at\nbirth, the human mind is a sort of blank slate on which experience\nwrites. In Book II Locke claims that ideas are the materials of\nknowledge and all ideas come from experience. The term\n\u2018idea\u2019, Locke tells us \u201c\u2026stands for\nwhatsoever is the Object of the Understanding, when a man\nthinks\u201d (I.1.8, N: 47). Experience is of two kinds, sensation\nand reflection. One of these\u2014sensation\u2014tells us about\nthings and processes in the external world. The\nother\u2014reflection\u2014tells us about the operations of our own\nminds. Reflection is a sort of internal sense that makes us conscious\nof the mental processes we are engaged in. Some ideas we get only from\nsensation, some only from reflection and some from both.\n\nLocke has an atomic or perhaps more accurately a corpuscular theory of\n ideas.[4]\n There is, that is to say, an analogy between the way atoms or\ncorpuscles combine into complexes to form physical objects and the way\nideas combine. Ideas are either simple or complex. We cannot create\nsimple ideas, we can only get them from experience. In this respect\nthe mind is passive. Once the mind has a store of simple ideas, it can\ncombine them into complex ideas of a variety of kinds. In this respect\nthe mind is active. Thus, Locke subscribes to a version of the\nempiricist axiom that there is nothing in the intellect that was not\npreviously in the senses\u2014where the senses are broadened to\ninclude reflection. Book III deals with the nature of language, its\nconnections with ideas and its role in knowledge. Book IV, the\nculmination of the previous reflections, explains the nature and\nlimits of knowledge, probability, and the relation of reason and\nfaith. Let us now consider the Essay in some detail.\n",
