    "main_text": "The Normativity of Law || Legal Form\n4.2 Legal Form\n\nLegal regulation takes a number of distinct legal forms to which\nlegislators and judges pay strict attention. The state might impose,\non the same conduct, one or more of the following forms of regulation:\ncriminal penalties, a civil fine, an administrative fine, a tax, a\nlicense, or a private civil action. Different forms of regulation\nclearly have different expressive features. But typically the legal\nprofession and the public may think the different forms have different\nbehavioral consequences. These different behavioral consequences may\nsuggest that the law, or at least the form the legal regulation takes,\nprovides distinctive reasons for action.\n\nContrast, for example, enforcing an air pollution emission standard\nthrough a criminal penalty rather than a tax. The two regulatory\nregimes clearly express different attitudes towards emissions. The\ncriminal penalty prohibits emissions (above the stated\nstandard); the tax permits emissions (above the stated\nstandard). Lawyers tend to believe that a criminal prohibition will\nreduce emissions more than the tax. \n\nSimilarly, a city might redesignate a section of the curb from\n\u201cno parking,\u201d enforced by an administrative fine to\nmetered parking. The \u201cno parking\u201d designation prohibits\nparking in the identified zone while meters permit parking upon\npayment of the (licensing) fee. The city presumably expects that,\nunder \u201cno parking\u201d, the stretch of curb will remain clear,\nwhile it expects cars to use the same stretch when parking is metered.\nThe distinction between a prohibition and a permission clearly has\nexpressive\n content.[17]\n\n\nThese legal forms, of course, differ not only in their expressive\ncontent but also in their substantive features. Monitoring for\ncriminal violations differs dramatically from monitoring for\nregulation through a private civil action. In the latter case, private\ncitizens identify violations of the standard; in the former,\ngovernment officials police the regulated conduct. Further, the fora\nin which violations are adjudicated may differ not only in the burdens\nand standard of proof but also in the identity of the fact-finder that\nmight be an administrator, a judge or a jury (with varying decision\nrules from majority to unanimity). Finally, the size and nature of\nboth the formal and informal sanction may vary. The policymaker sets\nthe formal sanction but the informal sanction arises from the informal\nsocial response to violation of the norm. Violating a criminal law\ntypically provokes more severe social sanctions than violating an\nadministrative regulation or a norm enforced only through private\ncivil actions.\n\nThese institutional variations suggest that the rational policymaker\nwill determine that different forms, even if they impose identical\nsanctions, will create different expected penalties for violating the\nnorm and give rise to different distributions of type 1 and type 2\nerrors, where a type 1 error incorrectly rejects plaintiff\u2019s\nclaim and a type 2 error incorrectly accepts it. The different legal\nforms will thus create different incentives and induce different\nbehaviors, even when imposed sanctions are identical. Moreover, the\npolicymaker might in fact choose among these forms on the basis of\nthese different incentives and on the relative importance of Type 1\nand Type 2 errors.\n\nThe elaborate differences among these legal forms thus make it\ndifficult to isolate a distinctive account of legal normativity. The\nsubtle variations in form have consequences for behavior on the\neconomic account that might explain variations in responses to the\nvarious legal forms that we might have initially attribute to\nnormativity.\n",
