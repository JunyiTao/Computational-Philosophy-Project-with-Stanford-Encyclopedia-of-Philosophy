    "main_text": "Issues about Diachronic Norms || Memory Loss\n5.4 Memory Loss\n\nConditionalization in the standard version preserves certainties,\nwhich fails to accommodate cases of memory loss (Talbott 1991):\n\n\nExample (Dinner). At 6:30 PM on March 15,\n1989, Bill is certain that he is having spaghetti for dinner that\nnight. But by March 15 of the next year, Bill has completely forgotten\nwhat he had for dinner one year ago.\n\n\n\nThere are even putative counterexamples that appear to be\nworse\u2014with an agent who faces only the danger of memory loss\nrather than actual memory loss. Here is one such example (Arntzenius\n2003):\n\n\nExample (Shangri-La). A traveler has reached a\nfork in the road to Shangri-La. The guardians will flip a fair coin to\ndetermine her path. If it comes up heads, she will travel the path by\nthe Mountains and correctly remember that all along. If instead it\ncomes up tails, she will travel by the Sea\u2014with her memory\naltered upon reaching Shangri-La so that she will incorrectly remember\nhaving traveled the path by the Mountains. So, either way, once in\nShangri-La the traveler will remember having traveled the path by the\nMountains. The guardians explain this entire arrangement to the\ntraveler, who believes those words with certainty. It turns out that\nthe coin comes up heads. So the traveler travels the path by the\nMountains and has credence 1 that she does. But once she reaches\nShangri-La and recalls the guardians\u2019 words, that credence\nsuddenly drops from 1 down to 0.5.\n\n\n\nThat credence drop violates the Principle of Conditionalization, and\nall that happens without any actual loss of memory.\n\nIt may be replied that conditionalization can be plausibly generalized\nto accommodate the above case. Here is an attempt made by Titelbaum\n(2013a: ch. 6), who develops an idea that can be traced back to Levi\n(1980: sec. 4.3):\n\n\nThe Principle of Generalized Conditionalization\n(Certainties Version). It ought to be that, if two considered\npossibilities each entail one\u2019s certainties at an earlier time\nand continue to do so at a later time, then their credence ratio are\npreserved across those two times.\n\n\n\nThis norm allows the set of one\u2019s certainties to expand or\nshrink, while incorporating the core idea of conditionalization:\npreservation of credence ratios. To see how this norm accommodates the\nShangri-La Case, assume for simplicity that the traveler starts at the\ninitial time with a set of certainties, which expands upon seeing the\ncoin toss result at a later time, but shrinks back to the\noriginal set of certainties upon reaching Shangri-La at the\nfinal time. Note that there is no change in one\u2019s certainties\nacross the initial time and the final time. So, by the above norm,\none\u2019s credences at the final time (upon reaching Shangri-La)\nshould be identical to those at the initial time (the start of the\ntrip). In particular, one\u2019s final credence in traveling the path\nby the Mountains should be the same as the initial credence, which is\n0.5. For more on the attempts to save conditionalization from cases of\nactual or potential memory loss, see Meacham (2010), Moss (2012), and\nTitelbaum (2013a: ch. 6 and 7).\n\nThe Principle of Generalized Conditionalization, as stated above,\nmight be thought to be an incomplete diachronic norm because it leaves\nopen the question of how one\u2019s certainties ought to change.\nEarly attempts at a positive answer are due to Harper (1976, 1978) and\nLevi (1980: ch. 1\u20134). Their ideas are developed independently of\nthe issue of memory loss, but are motivated by the scenarios in which\nan agent finds a need to revise or even retract what she used to take\nto be her evidence. Although Harper\u2019s and Levi\u2019s\napproaches are not identical, they share the common idea that\none\u2019s certainties ought to change under the constraint of\ncertain diachronic axioms, now known as the AGM axioms in the\nbelief revision\n literature.[9]\n For some reasons against the Harper-Levi approach to norms of\ncertainty change, see Titelbaum (2013a: sec. 7.4.1).\n",
