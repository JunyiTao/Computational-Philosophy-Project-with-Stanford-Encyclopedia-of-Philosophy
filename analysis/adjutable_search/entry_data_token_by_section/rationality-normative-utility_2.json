    "main_text": "Defining Expected Utility || Outcome Utilities\n1.2 Outcome Utilities\n\n\nThe term \\(U(o)\\) represents the utility of the outcome\n\\(o\\)\u2014roughly, how valuable \\(o\\) is.  Formally, \\(U\\) is a\nfunction that assigns a real number to each of the outcomes. (The\nunits associated with \\(U\\) are typically called utiles,\nso that if \\(U(o) = 2\\), we say that \\(o\\) is worth 2 utiles.) The greater\nthe utility, the more valuable the outcome.\n\n\nWhat kind of value is measured in utiles? Utiles are typically\nnot taken to be units of currency, like dollars, pounds, or\nyen. Bernoulli (1738) argued that money and other goods have\ndiminishing marginal utility: as an agent gets richer, every successive\ndollar (or gold watch, or apple) is less valuable to her than the\nlast. He gives the following example: It makes rational sense for\na rich man, but not for a pauper, to pay 9,000 ducats in exchange for a\nlottery ticket that yields a 50% chance at 20,000 ducats and a 50%\nchance at nothing. Since the lottery gives the two men the same\nchance at each monetary prize, the prizes must have different values\ndepending on whether the player is poor or rich.\n\n\nClassic utilitarians such as Bentham (1789), Mill (1861), and Sidgwick\n(1907) interpreted utility as a measure of pleasure or happiness. For\nthese authors, to say \\(A\\) has greater utility than \\(B\\) (for an\nagent or a group of agents) is to say that \\(A\\) results in more\npleasure or happiness than \\(B\\) (for that agent or group of\nagents).\n\n\nOne objection to this interpretation of utility is that there may\nnot be a single good (or indeed any good) which rationality requires us\nto seek. But if we understand \u201cutility\u201d broadly\nenough to include all potentially desirable ends\u2014pleasure,\nknowledge, friendship, health and so on\u2014it\u2019s not clear that\nthere is a unique correct way to make the tradeoffs between different\ngoods so that each outcome receives a utility. There may be no\ngood answer to the question of whether the life of an ascetic monk\ncontains more or less good than the life of a happy libertine\u2014but\nassigning utilities to these options forces us to compare them.\n\n\nContemporary decision theorists typically interpret utility as a\nmeasure of preference, so that to say that \\(A\\) has greater\nutility than \\(B\\) (for an agent) is simply to say that the agent\nprefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). It is crucial to this approach\nthat preferences hold not just between outcomes (such as amounts of\npleasure, or combinations of pleasure and knowledge), but also between\nuncertain prospects (such as a lottery that pays $1 million dollars if\na particular coin lands heads, and results in an hour of painful\nelectric shocks if the coin lands tails). Section 2 of this\narticle addresses the formal relationship between preference and choice\nin detail.\n\n\nExpected utility theory does not require that preferences\nbe selfish or self-interested. Someone can prefer giving money to\ncharity over spending the money on lavish dinners, or prefer\nsacrificing his own life over allowing his child to die. Sen\n(1977) suggests that each person\u2019s psychology is best represented\nusing three rankings: one representing the person\u2019s narrow\nself-interest, a second representing the person\u2019s self-interest\nconstrued more broadly to account for feelings of sympathy (e.g.,\nsuffering when watching another person suffer), and a third\nrepresenting the person\u2019s commitments, which may require her to\nact against her self-interest broadly construed.\n\n\nBroome (1991, Ch. 6) interprets utilities as measuring comparisons of\nobjective betterness and worseness, rather than personal preferences:\nto say that \\(A\\) has a greater utility than \\(B\\) is to say that\n\\(A\\) is objectively better than \\(B\\), or that a rational person\nwould prefer \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). Just as there is nothing in the formalism\nof probability theory that requires us to use subjective rather than\nobjective probabilities, so there is nothing in the formalism of\nexpected utility theory that requires us to use subjective rather than\nobjective values.\n\n\nThose who interpret utilities in terms of personal preference face a\nspecial challenge: the so-called problem of interpersonal utility\ncomparisons. When making decisions about how to distribute\nshared resources, we often want to know if our acts would make Alice\nbetter off than Bob\u2014and if so, how much better off. But if\nutility is a measure of individual preference, there is no clear,\nmeaningful way of making these comparisons. Alice\u2019s\nutilities are constituted by Alice\u2019s preferences, Bob\u2019s\nutilities are constituted by Bob\u2019s preferences, and there are no\npreferences spanning Alice and Bob. We can\u2019t assume that\nAlice\u2019s utility 10 is equivalent to Bob\u2019s utility 10, any\nmore than we can assume that getting an A grade in differential\nequations is equivalent to getting an A grade in basket weaving.\n\n\nNow is a good time to consider which features of the utility\nfunction carry meaningful information. Comparisons are\ninformative: if \\(U(o_1) \\gt U(o_2)\\) (for a person), then\n\\(o_1\\) is better than (or preferred to)\n\\(o_2\\). But it is not only comparisons\nthat are informative\u2014the utility function must carry other\ninformation, if expected utility theory is to give meaningful\nresults.\n\n\nTo see why, consider the umbrella example again. This time,\nI\u2019ve filled in a probability for each state, and a utility for each\noutcome.\n\n\n\nstates\n\n\nit rains \\((P = 0.6)\\)\nit does not rain \\((P = 0.4)\\)\n\n\nacts\ntake umbrella\nencumbered, dry \\((U = 5)\\)\nencumbered, dry \\((U = 5)\\)\n\n\nleave umbrella\nwet \\((U = 0)\\)\nfree, dry \\((U =10)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe expected utility of taking the umbrella is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nEU(\\take)&= P_{\\take}(\\encumbered, \\dry) \\cdot 5  \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\take}(\\wet) \\cdot 0        \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\take}(\\free, dry) \\cdot 10 \\\\\n         &=5\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhile the expected utility of leaving the umbrella is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nEU(\\leave)&= P_{\\leave}(\\encumbered, \\dry) \\cdot 5  \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\leave}(\\wet) \\cdot 0        \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\leave}(\\free, dry) \\cdot 10 \\\\\n         &=4\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSince \\(EU(\\take) \\gt EU(\\leave)\\), expected utility theory tells me\nthat taking the umbrella is better than leaving it.\n\n\nBut now, suppose we change the utilities of the outcomes: instead of\nusing \\(U\\), we use \\(U'\\).\n\n\n\nstates\n\n\nit rains \\((P=0.6)\\)\nit does not rain \\((P=0.4)\\)\n\n\nacts\ntake umbrella\nencumbered, dry \\((U'=4)\\)\nencumbered, dry \\((U'=4)\\)\n\n\nleave umbrella\nwet \\((U'=2)\\)\nfree, dry \\((U'=8)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe new expected utility of taking the umbrella is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nEU'(\\take)&= P_{\\take}(\\encumbered, \\dry) \\cdot 4  \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\take}(\\wet) \\cdot 2        \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\take}(\\free, dry) \\cdot 8 \\\\\n         &= 4\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhile the new expected utility of leaving the umbrella is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nEU'(\\leave)&= P_{\\leave}(\\encumbered, \\dry) \\cdot 4  \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\leave}(\\wet) \\cdot 2        \\\\\n         & \\quad + P_{\\leave}(\\free, dry) \\cdot 8 \\\\\n         &= 4.4\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSince \\(EU'(\\take) \\lt EU'(\\leave)\\), expected utility theory tells me\nthat leaving the umbrella is better than taking it.\n\n\nThe utility functions \\(U\\) and \\(U'\\) rank the outcomes\nin exactly the same way: free, dry is best;\nencumbered, dry ranks in the middle; and wet\nis worst. Yet expected utility theory gives different advice in\nthe two versions of the problem. So there must be some\nsubstantive difference between preferences appropriately described by\n\\(U\\), and preferences appropriately described by\n\\(U'\\). Otherwise, expected utility theory is fickle, and\nliable to change its advice when fed different descriptions of the same\nproblem.\n\n\nWhen do two utility functions represent the same basic state of\naffairs? Measurement theory answers the question by characterizing the\nallowable transformations of a utility function\u2014ways of\nchanging it that leave all of its meaningful features intact. If we\ncharacterize the allowable transformations of a utility function, we\nhave thereby specified which of its features are meaningful.\n\n\nDefenders of expected utility theory typically require that utility\nbe measured by a linear scale, where the\nallowable transformations are all and only the positive linear\ntransformations, i.e., functions \\(f\\) of the form\n\n\\[\nf(U(o))=x {\\cdot} U(o)+y\n\\]\n\n\n\nfor real numbers \\(x \\gt 0\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\nPositive linear transformations of outcome utilities will never\naffect the verdicts of expected utility theory: if \\(A\\) has\ngreater expected utility than \\(B\\) where utility is measured by\nfunction \\(U\\), then \\(A\\) will also have greater expected\nutility than \\(B\\) where utility is measured by any positive\nlinear transformation of \\(U\\). \n",
