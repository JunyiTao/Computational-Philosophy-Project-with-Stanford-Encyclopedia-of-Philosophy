    "main_text": "Living Beings and the Origin of Souls\n4. Living Beings and the Origin of Souls\n\nStill, using the notion of form in this way to characterize the\nsubstantiality of the ultimate constituents of reality still leaves\nmuch to be explicated with respect to the origin of living beings.\nTaurellus considers a creation theory of the origin of human souls\n(PT: 144), but he also voices doubt concerning such a theory. In\nparticular, he cautions that an act of divine creation would render\nthe imperfection of human souls inexplicable (PT: 166). Therefore, he\noffers an integrated naturalistic account of the origin of the souls\nof non-human animals and humans.\n\nHere, the connection between Taurellus and his teacher Jacob Schegk\nbecomes relevant. Schegk maintains that both inanimate forms and\nanimate forms depend on the mixture of elements. As he points out,\nsuch a conception of the origin of animate forms has the consequence\nthat \u201can animate form also is a physical form \u2026\u201d\n(PT). In fact, such a view of the origin of souls is found in\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (fl. ca. 200 CE), upon whose work Schegk has\ncommented extensively. According to Alexander, the soul \n\n\nis a power and form, which supervenes through such a mixture upon the\ntemperament of bodies; and it is not a proportion or a composition of\nthe temperament. (Alexander of Aphrodisias 1568: 78, 2008: 104) \n\n\nAs Victor Caston has argued, talk about supervenience should here be\ntaken in the technical sense of a co-variation of mental states with\nbodily states (Caston 1997: 348\u2013349). Moreover, Caston\nemphasizes that, for Alexander, the soul possesses causal powers that\nare more than the aggregates of the causal powers of the elements\n(1997: 349\u2013350). In the sense that Alexander ascribes distinct\nnew powers to souls as well as to the forms of non-animate composites\nsuch as chemical blends, Caston characterizes Alexander as one of the\nancient thinkers who were committed to emergentism (1997).\n\nTaurellus adopts a similar line of argument. He holds that \n\n\nwhen by mutual action and passion mixed things are changed in such a\nway that none of them remains entirely the same, but some new form\narises out of it that related to the forces of all of them, without\ndoubt there exist mixed forms that have the forces of many, bring\nabout different effects, which is most evident in the changes of\nthings and especially in the use of medicaments. (PT: 272) \n\n\nAlso, he is clear that what arises in genuine mixture is not only a\ncomposition of simple compounds but also a simple form. In his view,\nthis form is simple \u201cbecause it is not composed but rather\ngenerated\u201d (PT: 42). Consequently, it cannot undergo a process\nof being split up, although it can perish when the basis from which it\nemerges is changed (PT). This is why the simplicity and immateriality\nof emergent forms is compatible with their capability of being\ndestroyed (PT: 44; 276). \n\nThis conception of the emergence of new forms is what underlies\nTaurellus\u2019s analysis of the structure of plants and animals. He\nascribes soul and life only to the latter since only they possess\nsense and self-motion (PT: 350), but this should not obscure the\nfundamental analogy between the emergence of forms in plant and the\nemergence of forms in animals. In his view, what possesses life in the\nproper sense are higher kinds of forms\u2014the souls of animals\n(PT). The organic body of an animal, constituted by a plurality of\nless noble substantial forms, possesses life only in a derivative\nsense, since it possesses active and passive properties that derive\nfrom the active and passive properties of the animal soul (PT: 352).\nBut even if he follows the Galenic tradition in denying life to plants\n(VML: sig. B3r), he ascribes to each plant a substantial form that\naccounts for some of the activities of the organic plant\nbody\u2014activity that cannot be explained by the temperament of\nelementary qualities (VML: sig. G3r). Something analogous holds for\nplant seeds and animal seeds: They do not possess a soul but a natural\nform that is capable of generating plants and animals (VML: sig. B5r;\nTRA: 11). As Taurellus argues, it is necessary to postulate the\nexistence of such natural forms because not all kinds of attraction\nrelevant for operation of plants and seeds can be explained by the\nagency of elementary heat (VML: sig. B5v). Thus, even plant forms and\nseed forms possess new causal potencies that go beyond the causal\npotencies of the elements that function as the matter of the emerging\nform.\n\nAs Taurellus characterizes it, there is a circle of causation between\nthe emergent form and the elements from which it emerges: The life of\nthe soul is communicated to the body (VML: sig. Gr), but the life of\nthe souls is also perfected by actions that it can only carry out by\nmeans of the body (VML: sig. Gv). Consequently, the soul perfects the\nbody and the body perfects the soul (VML: sig. G2r). Astonishingly,\nTaurellus applies such a conception of the mutual dependence between\nforms and organic bodies even to the case of humans. As he claims,\n\u201cthe human soul by itself is capable of ceasing to be\u201d\n(VML: sig. F4v). Thus, they have in common with the soul of brutes\nthat \u201cthey necessarily have their essence and life in a\nbody\u201d (VML: sig. G4r; see TRA: 11). Taurellus does not challenge\nthe theological idea of immortality but concludes that if human beings\nare immortal, the relevant supernatural divine agency responsible for\nresurrection must relate to soul and body alike (TRA: 26).\n",
