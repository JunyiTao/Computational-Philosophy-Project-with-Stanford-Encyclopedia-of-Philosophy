    "main_text": "Structuralism and Nominalism || In Rebus structuralism\n4.4 In Rebus structuralism\n\nField\u2019s physicalist interpretation of arithmetic and analysis\nnot only undermines the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument. It\nalso partially provides an answer to Benacerraf\u2019s\nepistemological challenge. Admittedly it is not a simple task to give\nan account of how humans obtain knowledge of spacetime regions. But at\nleast according to many (but not all) philosophers spacetime regions\nare physically real. So we are no longer required to explicate how\nflesh and blood mathematicians stand in contact with non-physical\nentities. But Benacerraf\u2019s identification problem remains. One\nmay wonder why one spacetime point or region rather than another plays\nthe role of the number \\(\\pi\\), for instance.\n\nIn response to the identification problem, it seems attractive to\ncombine a structuralist approach with Field\u2019s nominalism. This\nleads to versions of nominalist structuralism, which can be\noutlined as follows. Let us focus on mathematical analysis. The\nnominalist structuralist denies that any concrete physical system is\nthe unique intended interpretation of analysis. All concrete physical\nsystems that satisfy the basic principles of Real Analysis (RA) would\ndo equally well. So the content of a sentence \\(\\phi\\) of the language\nof analysis is (roughly) given by:\n\nEvery concrete system S that makes RA true, also makes \\(\\phi\\)\ntrue.\n\nThis entails that, as with ante rem structuralism, only\nstructural aspects are relevant to the truth or falsehood of\nmathematical statements. But unlike ante rem structuralism,\nno abstract structure is postulated above and beyond concrete\nsystems.\n\nAccording to in rebus structuralism, no abstract structures\nexist over and above the systems that instantiate them; structures\nexist only in the systems that instantiate them. For this\nreason nominalist in rebus structuralism is sometimes\ndescribed as \u201cstructuralism without structures\u201d.\nNominalist structuralism is a form of in rebus structuralism.\nBut in rebus structuralism is not exhausted by nominalist\nstructuralism. Even the version of platonism that takes mathematics to\nbe about structures in the set-theoretic sense of the word can be\nviewed as a form of in rebus structuralism.\n\nIn mathematical discourse, non-algebraic structures (such as\n\u2018the\u2019 natural numbers) and mathematical objects (such as\n\u2018the\u2019 number 1) are referred to by definite descriptions.\nThis strongly suggests that mathematical symbols (N, 1) have a unique\nreference rather than a \u2018distributed\u2019 one as in\nrebus structuralism would have it. But in rebus\nstructuralists argue that such mathematical symbols function as\ndedicated variables in much the same way as in \u2018Tommy\nneeds his letters from home\u2019, a world war II slogan, the name\n\u2018Tommy\u2019 is chosen to stand for some arbitrary concrete\nsoldier, and re-used on many occasions without changing its reference\n(Pettigrew 2008).\n\nIf Hilbert\u2019s worry is wellfounded in the sense that there are no\nconcrete physical systems that make the postulates of mathematical\nanalysis true, then the above nominalist structuralist rendering of\nthe content of a sentence \\(\\phi\\) of the language of analysis gets\nthe truth conditions of such sentences wrong. For then for\nevery universally quantified sentence \\(\\phi\\), its\nparaphrase will come out vacuously true. So an existential assumption\nto the effect that there exist concrete physical systems that can\nserve as a model for RA is needed to back up the above analysis of the\ncontent of mathematical statements. Perhaps something like\nField\u2019s construction fits the bill.\n\nPutnam noticed early on that if the above explication of the content\nof mathematical sentences is modified somewhat, a substantially weaker\nbackground assumption is sufficient to obtain the correct truth\nconditions (Putnam 1967). Putnam proposed the following modal\nrendering of the content of a sentence \\(\\phi\\) of the language of\nanalysis:\n\nNecessarily, every concrete system S that makes RA true, also\nmakes \\(\\phi\\) true.\n\nThis is a stronger statement than the nonmodal rendering that was\npresented earlier. But it seems equally plausible. And an advantage of\nthis rendering is that the following modal existential background\nassumption is sufficient to make the truth conditions of mathematical\nstatements come out right:\n\nIt is possible that there exists a concrete physical system\nthat can serve as a model for RA.\n\n(\u2018It is possible that\u2019 here means \u2018It is or might\nhave been the case that\u2019.) Now Hilbert\u2019s concern seems\nadequately addressed. For on Putnam\u2019s account, the truth of\nmathematical sentences no longer depends on physical assumptions about\nthe actual world.\n\nIt is admittedly not easy to give a satisfying account of how we\nknow that this modal existential assumption is fulfilled. But\nit may be hoped that the task is less daunting than the task of\nexplaining how we succeed in knowing facts about abstract entities.\nAnd it should not be forgotten that the structuralist aspect of this\n(modal) nominalist position keeps Benacerraf\u2019s identification\nchallenge at bay.\n\nPutnam\u2019s strategy also has its limitations. Chihara sought to\napply Putnam\u2019s strategy not only to arithmetic and analysis but\nalso to set theory (Chihara 1973). Then a crude version of the\nrelevant modal existential assumption becomes:\n\nIt is possible that there exist concrete physical systems\nthat can serve as a model for ZFC.\n\nParsons has noted that when possible worlds are needed which contain\ncollections of physical entities that have large transfinite\ncardinalities or perhaps are even too large to have a cardinal number,\nit becomes hard to see these as possible concrete or physical systems\n(Parsons 1990a). We seem to have no reason to believe that there could\nbe physical worlds that contain highly transfinitely many\nentities.\n",
