    "main_text": "Early Partial Formalizations and Metamathematics || Heyting 1928\n4.2 Heyting 1928\n\nWhile Kolmogorov\u2019s work remained unknown in the West, an\nindependent initiative towards the formalization of intuitionistic\nlogic and mathematics was taken in 1927, when the Dutch Mathematical\nSociety chose to pose the following problem for its annual\ncontest:\n\n\nBy its very nature, Brouwer\u2019s set theory cannot be identified\nwith the conclusions formally derivable in a certain pasigraphic\nsystem [i.e., universal notation system]. Nevertheless certain\nregularities may be observed in the language which Brouwer uses to\ngive expression to his mathematical intuition; these regularities may\nbe codified in a formal mathematical system. It is asked to\n\nconstruct such a system and to indicate its deviations from\nBrouwer\u2019s theories;\nto investigate whether from the system to be constructed a dual\nsystem may be obtained by (formally) interchanging the principium\ntertii exclusi and the principium contradictionis.\n(Troelstra 1990: 4)\n\n\n\nThe question had been formulated by Brouwer\u2019s friend, colleague,\nand former teacher Gerrit Mannoury, who asked Brouwer\u2019s opinion\non it beforehand in a letter (Brouwer was in\n Berlin);[18]\n unfortunately, no reply from Brouwer has been found, but the final\nformulation was the same as in Mannoury\u2019s letter.\n\nBrouwer\u2019s former student Arend Heyting, who had graduated (cum\nlaude) in 1925 with a dissertation on intuitionistic projective\ngeometry, wrote what turned out to be the one submission (Hesseling\n2003: 274). The original manuscript seems no longer to exist, but it\nis known that its telling motto was \u201cStones for\n bread\u201d.[19]\n In 1928, the jury crowned Heyting\u2019s\n work,[20]\n stating that it was \u201ca formalization carried out in a most\nknowledgeable way and with admirable perseverance\u201d (Hesseling\n2003: 274; translation modified).\n\nHeyting\u2019s essay covered propositional logic, predicate logic,\narithmetic, and Brouwerian set theory or analysis. One would think\nthat, to be able to achieve this, Heyting must have had quite precise\nideas on how to explain the logical connectives intuitionistically.\nHowever, Heyting\u2019s correspondence with Freudenthal in 1930 shows\nthat before 1930, Heyting had not yet arrived at the explicit\nrequirement of a transformation procedure in the explanation of\nimplication (see the\n quotation\n in\n section 5.1\n below).\n\nSince the original manuscript seems not to have survived, a discussion\nof Heyting\u2019s work must take the revised and published version\nfrom 1930 as its point of departure; see below.\n\nHeyting sent his manuscript to Brouwer, who replied in a letter of\nJuly 17, 1928, that he had found it \u201cextraordinarily\ninteresting\u201d, and continued:\n\n\nBy now I have already begun to appreciate your work so much, that I\nshould like to request that you revise it in German for the\nMathematische Annalen (preferably somewhat extended rather than\n shortened).[21]\n\n\nInterestingly, Brouwer also suggested (with an eye on the\nformalization of the theory of choice sequences)\n\n\nAnd, with an eye on \u00a713, perhaps also the notion of\n\u201claw\u201d can be formalized.\n\n\nIt seems, however, that Heyting made no effort in that direction.\n\nHeyting\u2019s paper would indeed be published soon after, in 1930;\nnot in the Mathematische Annalen, as Brouwer by then was no\nlonger on its editorial board, but in the proceedings of the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences. However, Heyting\u2019s work became known\nalready before its publication. Heyting mentioned it in correspondence\nwith Glivenko in 1928 (see below), Tarski and \u0141ukasiewicz talked\nabout it to Bernays at the Bologna conference in 1928, and Church\nmentioned it in a letter to Errera in 1929 (Hesseling 2003: 274).\n",
