Some of these biases\nare about racial or gender groups. A big question not just in\nphilosophy and psychology, but in the daily running of our society is\nwhere these biases come from and what we can do about them. There is\nsome evidence that at least some of these biases have a lot to do with\nmental imagery.\n\nFirst of all, a number of empirical studies show that the vividness of\nmental imagery biases our behavior. If you are deciding between two\npositive scenarios, the one that brings up the more vivid mental\nimagery tends to win out. And if you are deciding between two negative\nscenarios, the one that brings up the less vivid mental imagery tends\nto win out (Austin and Vancouver 1996, Trope and Liberman 2003, see\nalso the rich literature on construal level theory and also on the\neffects of the vividness of mental imagery on future discounting, see\nParthasarathi et al. 2017, Mok et al. 2020). Here is an example: If a\nsmoker is deciding between smoking a cigarette and not smoking one,\nthe smoking option brings up very vivid and detailed (and emotionally\ncharged) mental imagery. Meanwhile, the non-smoking option\ndoesn\u2019t bring up any mental imagery at all, or if it does it is\nnot at all detailed and not at all vivid (of just sitting there, not\nsmoking). This is why smoking tends to win out, and also why it is\noften difficult to stop procrastinating activities like playing video\ngames or checking our social media feed: continuing what we have been\ndoing is represented much more vividly than stopping.\n\nMental imagery can also explain some famous examples of racial bias\n(Nanay 2021b, see also Sullivan-Bissett 2019, who describes implicit\nracial bias as unconscious imagination, not imagery). Subjects are\nmore likely to misperceive a phone as a gun if a black person holds it\nthan if a white person does so (Payne 2001). The perceptual state that\nrepresents a black person holding a phone gives rise to the mental\nimagery that represents a black person holding a gun. This mental\nimagery does not have to be conscious \u2013 and when white people\nrate black people as more dangerous, it is possible that the mental\nimagery that grounds these judgments is not conscious. The same is\ntrue of the biased behavior of standing further away from some people\nthan others in the elevator. The importance of mental imagery in\nimplicit bias is also supported by the fact that one of the most\nefficient ways of counteracting implicit bias is based on modifying\nthe subject\u2019s mental imagery and the efficiency of these\nprocedures correlates with the vividness of the subjects\u2019 mental\nimagery (see Lai et al 2013, Blair et al. 2001, Blair 2002, see also\nPeck et al. 2013 for further relevant findings).\n",
