    "main_text": "Epistemology of Agent-Based Modeling || The challenge of abstract modeling\n5.1 The challenge of abstract modeling\n\nIn an early discussion on simulations in social sciences, Boero and\nSquazzoni (2005) proposed a classification of ABMs into case-based\nmodels, typifications, and theoretical abstractions\u2014based on the\nproperties of the represented target. While a case-based model\nrepresents an empirical scenario that is delineated in time and space,\ntypifications represent classes of empirical phenomena. Finally,\ntheoretical abstractions, as their name suggests, abstract away from\nvarious features of empirical targets and aim at simplified and\ngeneral representation of social phenomena.\n\nFollowing the tradition of abstract ABMs in social sciences, the\nmajority of simulations in philosophy of science have been developed\nwithin the so-called \u201cKISS\u201d (Keep it Simple,\nStupid)\n approach.[14]\n As such, they belong to the third type of ABMs listed above. The main\nadvantage of constructing simple models is that they allow for an\neasier understanding of the represented causal mechanisms than complex\nmodels do. However, this also raises the question: what can we learn\nfrom these models about real science, given their highly idealized\ncharacter? For instance, do results of such simulations increase our\nunderstanding of scientific communities? Can we use them to provide\npotential explanations of certain episodes from the history of\nscience, or to formulate normative recommendations for how scientific\ninquiry should be organized? These questions have been a matter of\nphilosophical debate, closely related to the discussion on the\nepistemic function of highly idealized or toy-models across empirical\n sciences.[15]\n In particular, critics have argued that if abstract ABMs are to be\ninformative of empirical targets, they first need to be verified and\nempirically validated.\n",
