This pluralist stance is contrasted with a monist view\naccording to which science ultimately aims at establishing a single,\ncomplete, and comprehensive account of the world (Kellert, Longino,\n& Waters 2006b: x). An analogy with maps (Winther 2020) is often\nemployed to explain that such a pluralist stance is compatible with\nsome form of \u201cminimal\u201d (Longino 2002a) or\n\u201cmodest\u201d realism (Kitcher 2001). Which aspects of a part\nof the world are represented by a cartographer depends on the intended\nuse of the map, hence the production of a plurality of maps, whose\nconformity with the real world can be assessed on pragmatic grounds\nthrough successful use. Similarly, science produces a plurality of\npartial representations of a given phenomenon, depending on various\nepistemic and practical interests, whose conformity to the real world\ncan be assessed on empirical grounds.\n\nThis general idea of interest-dependency as a source of\nrepresentational pluralism has been developed further by specifying\nthe nature of the varying interests. In some cases, developing a\nplurality of partial models of a target system constitutes an\nintermediate, pragmatic step on the way to a richer, integrative\nrepresentation of the system. Consider the representation of a radio\nsource in astrophysics. Several models are developed, each\nrepresenting separately some specific features of the source deemed\nstriking or puzzling by the modeller, before being re-united to form\nan overall model (Bailer-Jones 2000). In other cases, the plurality of\nmodels of a target system reflects a plurality of modelling aims. In\nclimate modelling for instance, the variety of modelling tasks (e.g.,\nprediction of global average parameters, simulation of regional\nclimate change) explains the co-existence of different types of\nsimulations of the evolution of the Earth climate (Parker 2006).\nSituations of representational plurality may also reflect different\nmodelling preferences and choices regarding causal factors. Some\nmodellers may choose to track certain causal patterns instead of\nothers (Potochnik 2017). This is typically the case in the\npluridisciplinary study of human behavior. Significant differences\nfrom one modelling approach to another stem from differences in the\nemphasis put on some causal factors compared to others (Longino\n2006).\n\nA key issue raised by this plurality of models is the nature of the\nrelationship among multiple models developed to account for the same\nphenomenon. In some cases, multiple models appear complementary to the\nextent that each represents different features of the target system\n(as maps do). Other kinds of complementarity are less straightforward.\nThe models aim at representing the same features, but the modellers\nmay use different mathematical, idealizing techniques to do so.\nHowever, the resulting multiple idealized models can all provide\nuseful information. This is typically the case for instance in fluid\nmechanics when modelling turbulence flows (Morrison 2011).\nMultiplicity of complementary models of these kinds is deemed\nepistemically unproblematic since it is compatible with the realist\nexpectation that reliable knowledge about the system under study can\nbe derived from its multiple models.\n\nEpistemologically more challenging is the \u201cproblem of\ninconsistent models\u201d (Morrison 2011, 2015), which refers to the\nuse of multiple idealized models making conflicting assumptions to\naccount for the same phenomenon (Weisberg 2007). In contrast with\nsituations of complementary plurality, the existence of inconsistent\nmodels directly challenges realist epistemic ambitions by yielding\nincompatible claims about the ontology and causal features of the\ntarget system.\n\nVarious responses to the problem of inconsistent models have been\nproposed, reflecting different accounts of the proper epistemic\nattitude to adopt. Some pluralists develop an ontologically-laden\ndefense of permanently inconsistent plurality by putting to the fore\nsome features of the world\u2014such as its complexity or lack of\nordered structure (Longino 2006, 2013; Waters 2017). Inconsistent\nplurality, being ontologically grounded, is thus here to stay and one\nshould not expect to overcome it by choosing between conflicting\naccounts or trying to integrate them. Other pluralists, however,\nresist appeals to ontology to account for persistent methodological\nand conceptual divides among research programs regarding the same\nphenomenon. For example, it is sometimes argued that persistent\ndifferent approaches in biology should be traced back to persisting\ndivergent interests rather than conflicting commitments to states of\nthe world (Potochnik 2017). In \u201chistorical\u201d natural\nsciences such as climate science and cosmology, the persistent\nco-existence of multiple computer simulations of the evolution of a\ntarget system (e.g., the dark matter structures of the universe) can\nbe traced back to specific features of their building over time such\nas their plasticity and path-dependency (Lenhard & Winsberg 2010;\nRuphy 2011a).\n\nRecently, a growing body of literature has been investigating whether\nperspectivism can provide resources to address the challenges raised\nby multiple inconsistent models. Perspectivism comes in many shades in\nvarious branches of philosophy. In philosophy of science,\nperspectivism has been advocated as a promising third way between\nmonism and relativism (Giere 2006; van Fraassen 2008; Massimi &\nMcCoy [eds.] 2019). Current debates focus on the possibility of\nmaintaining realist positions when facing situations of coexistence of\nmultiple models. Some authors argue that a perspectival understanding\nof models is compatible with realism (Massimi 2018). Others stress\ndifficulties of defending the epistemic virtues of having multiple\nmodels without adopting an instrumental take on models (Morrison 2011,\n2015), or provide alternative, non-perspectival accounts of the\nexplanatory virtues of idealized models (Rice 2019).\n\nThe burgeoning literature on representational pluralism also raises\nquestions about the distinguishability of pluralism and relativism.\nWhile pluralism is often presented as a third way between monism and\nrelativism, rejections of \u201canything goes\u201d anarchy tend\nargue against a strawman rather than more sophisticated forms of\nepistemic relativism in contemporary philosophy of science (Kusch\n2020a). Still, many philosophers of science insist on a distinction\nbetween epistemic pluralism and relativism in the sense that the\nformer is taken to provide contextualized normative resources while\nthe latter is assumed to insist on claims of equal validity that\nundermine the formulation of evaluative standards. At the same time,\nepistemic relativists commonly accept contextual standards of\nevaluation, leading to a contested and muddy boundary between\nepistemic pluralism and relativism (Veigl forthcoming)\n",
