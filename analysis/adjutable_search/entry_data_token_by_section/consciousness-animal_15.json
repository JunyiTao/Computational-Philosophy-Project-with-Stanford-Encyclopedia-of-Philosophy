    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness || Great Apes\n6.2 Great Apes\n\n\nGallup (1970) developed an experimental test of mirror\nself-recognition that has become widely used as a test of\nself-awareness, although interpretation of the test remains\ncontroversial (see the section on\n self-consciousness and metacognition\nbelow). Gallup argues that the performance of chimpanzees in this test\nindicates that they are self-aware, and that animals that fail the\ntest lack self-awareness. Further, foreshadowing Carruthers, Gallup\nargues that self-awareness \u2014 in the sense of being able to think\nabout one\u2019s own mental states \u2014 is required for having a mind,\nand therefore that animals that \u2018fail\u2019 the mirror test\nhave no minds (1982, 1985). Though there has been controversy over\njust which animals \u2018pass\u2019 the validity of versions of the test modified for use with elephants, dolphins,and magpies has been challenged \n\u2014 as of 2002, Gallup maintained that there was evidence that\nhumans, common chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans consistently pass\nthe test, and strong evidence that a wide range of other primates fail\nconsistently fail. He took this to support the claim that\nself-awareness is unique to great apes (Gallup et al. 2002). Combined\nwith his earlier arguments that consciousness requires the sort of\nself-awareness measured by the mirror test, this would imply that\nconsciousness is unique to the great apes.\n\n Gallup\u2019s interpretation of the mirror results have not been\nuncontroversial (Mitchell 2002). Rochat and Zahavi (2010) challenge\nGallup both on a) the interpretation of chimps\u2019 mirror-oriented\nbehavior as indicating a human-like experience of mirror\nself-recognition, and b) the claim that mirror self-recognition is\nimplied by consciousness.\n As a side note, there has been a debate, ongoing since the early\n1990s (Cavalieri and Singer 1994) about whether great apes deserve\nspecial legal protection amounting to \u2018human rights\u2019. The\ncrux of the debate is not whether the great apes have consciousness\nper se (this seems to be assumed by most participants of the debate,\non both sides), but whether they have personhood. Personhood is\na vexed notion, but is generally thought to be related to certain\nforms of agency and self awareness, and is often thought to be tightly\ncoupled to moral status, as reflected in this debate (DeGrazia 1997;\nSEP article on Moral Status of Animals; Varner 2012). Though not\nessential to phenomenal consciousness, personhood is often thought to\npresuppose consciousness, and so perhaps is best thought of as a level\nof elaboration or complexity of consciousness.\n",
