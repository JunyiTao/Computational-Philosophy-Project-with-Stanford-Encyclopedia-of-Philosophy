    "main_text": "The Moral Status Framework\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nThe Unnaturalness Argument raises concerns about the unnaturalness\nof crossing species boundaries, and while it is sufficiently inchoate\nthat it may perhaps resist conclusive refutation, it is nonetheless a\nvery weak objection and it fails to provide any reasons for those who\ndo not object to chimeric research to change their minds. The Moral\nConfusion Argument has been alleged to be at the heart of the public\ncontroversy, but this allegation is not supported by the extensive\nsocial science research on public attitudes towards modern\nbiotechnology. Moreover, the consequences posited by the argument as\nbeing morally problematic seem unlikely to occur, and were they to\noccur, would probably be beneficial in the long run, even at the cost\nof some short-term social disruption. The Borderline-Personhood\nArgument focuses on the personhood-relevant properties of great apes\nand concludes that their borderline status as persons confers a high\nenough degree of moral status to make most, if not all, chimeric\nresearch on them impermissible. Like other traditional animal ethics\narguments, though, the argument depends upon controversial claims about\nthe sufficient conditions for full, or near-full, moral status. The\nHuman Dignity Argument attempts to explain why partial humanization of\na certain sort is morally wrong, but mistakenly assumes that such\nresearch would eliminate or diminish an individual\u2019s dignity-grounding\ncapacities. The Moral Status Framework maintains that status-enhancing\nchimeric research is permissible only if reasonable assurances are in\nplace that the individual\u2019s enhanced moral status will be adequately\nrespected. There are, however, several empirical and ethical\nuncertainties as to which chimeric research, if any, would enhance a non-human\nanimal\u2019s moral status.\n\n\nThe foregoing has focused on the ethics of creating chimeras, but much\nof the ethics discussion has either attempted to infer public policy\nconclusions straightaway or has taken place within discussions\nabout what public policy should be. The recommendations of the\nNational Academies guidelines prohibit the introduction of hESCs into\nnonhuman primate blastocysts (NAS 2006, 41), citing concerns about the\npotential human contribution of such cells. The International Society\nfor Stem Cell Research guidelines prohibit research that involves\nintroduction embryos into which hESCs have been introduced into any\nhuman or nonhuman primate uterus (ISSCR 2006). Although the ISSCR\nguidelines do not provide a rationale for this prohibition, the only\npotentially relevant rationale articulated in the accompanying\ncommentary cites a concern for the creation of \u201chumanized cognition,\nawareness, or other mental attributes\u201d (Hyun et al. 2007,\n162). Both groups appear to intend their recommendation to apply to\nall institutions carrying out hESC research, including public\ninstitutions. President Obama\u2019s National Institutes of Health\nregulations prohibit federal funds for research in which hESCs are\nintroduced into nonhuman primate blastocysts (National Institutes of\nHealth 2009). And, of course, proponents of stem cell research\ntypically do not argue only that the research is permissible but also\nthat the research should be eligible for federal funding.\n\n\nIt should be noted, however, that caution is warranted when inferring\npublic policy conclusions from conclusions about substantive,\nfirst-order ethics about biotechnology (Streiffer and Hedemann\n2007). \n\n\nPublic policy should take into account public opinion and comply with\nnorms of transparency (Baylis 2009). With regard to public opinion,\nthe UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) conducted a\n12-week public consultation in 2007 on chimeras and hybrids, providing\nbackground materials on the current state of science, law, and ethics\nand then soliciting people\u2019s opinions on a variety of ethical and\npolicy questions (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\n2007a). Although the consultation did not focus on human/animal\nchimeras as defined in this entry, it did find significance opposition\nto creating human/non-human hybrids, inserting animal cells into human\nembryos, and inserting mitochondrial DNA from animals into human\nembryos. In terms of transparency, a review by Baylis (ibid.)\nof the consultation process found it to be \u201can exercise in strategic\npublic relations\u201d in many respects (ibid., 47) in which the\nHFEA\u2019s preexisting policy preference led to bias in the presentation\nand discussion of options as well as their interpretation and\nreporting of the results (ibid.). \n\n\nA deeper concern about legitimacy also applies to chimera\nresearch. Legal moralism, the view that the fact that an act is\nmorally wrong provides a legitimate reason for the state to ban it, is\nincompatible with very plausible views about the requirement that\nlegitimate public policy be based on considerations that are neutral\non certain kinds of issues. For example, even on the assumption that\nthe Unnaturalness argument, interpreted as a religious objection\nagainst interfering with God\u2019s plans, is sound, it still would not\nprovide legitimate grounds for a public policy restriction on\nchimeras. Similarly, proponents of chimera research cannot\nlegitimately argue that it should be funded, or even just that it\nshould be legally permitted, because it represents humanity\u2019s partial\nfulfillment of a divine imperative to acquire knowledge and improve\nthe human condition. Chimera research raises issues about\nunnaturalness, God\u2019s plan, human dignity, and the moral status of\nanimals and humans at all stages of development. To evaluate these\nissues in the context of chimera research, some scholars are beginning\nto develop faith-based frameworks as well as Aristotelian-Thomistic\nframeworks (DiSilvestro 2004; Degeling, Irvine, and Kerridge 2013;\nEberl and Ballard 2009). In such discussions, many considerations that\nare viewed as carrying moral weight should not be viewed as providing\nlegitimate reasons for public policy (Basl 2010; Streiffer\n2010). Groups advocating, making, or implementing public policy\nregarding chimera research should therefore be sensitive to the\ndistinction between sound ethics and legitimate public policy.\n",
