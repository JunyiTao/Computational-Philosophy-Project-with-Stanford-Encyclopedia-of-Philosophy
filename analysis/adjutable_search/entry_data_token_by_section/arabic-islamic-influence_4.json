    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy || Eternity of the World\n4.1 Eternity of the World\n\nThe Greek theory of the eternity of the world was a challenge to the\nChristian world view, a challenge increased by the fact that the\ntheory was supported by Arabic sources: by Avicenna, who combined it\nwith a metaphysical concept of God as the \u201cnecessary being in\nitself\u201d, which is the eternal efficient cause of the existence\nof the heavenly and sublunar world (see section 6.4 on the first\ncause), and by Averroes, who combined it with a conception of God as\nthe prime mover, whose existence is proved in natural philosophy. In\nGiles of Rome\u2019 Errors of the Philosophers, Avicenna and\nAverroes are accused of many \u201cerrors\u201d, but the eternity of\nthe world figures most prominently. Averroes, in particular, is\nattacked for opposing \u201ceven more vehemently than did the\nPhilosopher (Aristotle) those who held that the world had had a\nbeginning\u201d (Giles of Rome 1944, 15). The eternity of the world\nand related theses were condemned as heretical in 1270 and 1277 by the\nParisian bishop \u00c9tienne Tempier (art. 87, 90, 99, 184)\n(Pich\u00e9 1999).\n\nIn the thirteenth century and beyond, the issue was widely discussed\nby the scholastics, who arrived at a variety of positions, but\nunanimously held that the world was created in time by God, which\nmeans that they never fully shared Avicenna\u2019s or Averroes\u2019\nposition. Many arguments of the scholastic discussion were drawn from\nArabic authorities, in particular from Averroes\u2019 long\ncommentaries on De caelo and Physics and from\nAvicenna\u2019s Metaphysics. First traces of Arabic\ninfluence can be found in Philip the Chancellor\u2019s Summa de\nbono (dating 1225\u20138). Thomas of York, for instance, takes\nover Averroes\u2019 exposition of the four principal views on the\nissue (Comm. magnum De caelo I.102; Dales 1990, 81). Passages\ndrawn from Arabic texts were not only employed to defend, but also to\nattack the eternity thesis. One particularly often quoted argument\ncomes from al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Intentions of the\nPhilosophers: If the world was eternal, an infinite number of\n(immortal) souls would now exist, which is impossible (Dales 1990, 44,\n256). Another very influential source of the Latin debate was\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide for the Perplexed\n(II.13\u201328); Maimonides argued that both eternity and\nnon-eternity are possible philosophically.\n\nThomas Aquinas\u2019 Commentary on the Sentences (II, d.1\nq.1 a.5) is a good example of the impact of Arabic sources. Among the\narguments cited from Averroes in favour of eternity are that there is\nalways another moment in time before a moment in time; that only\nmotion can be the cause of a change from rest to motion; that if the\nworld had a beginning, a vacuum would precede the world (Comm.\nmagnum De caelo III.29, Comm. magnum Phys.\nVIII.8,9,11,15). Avicenna is cited by Thomas as holding that\nGod\u2019s will is unchangeable and never starts anew (an argument\nadvanced also by Averroes), and that it is impossible that God\nprecedes the world in duration, because this implies that time existed\nbefore the world and before movement (Metaphysics IX.1).\nThese arguments clearly influenced Thomas\u2019 conclusion that the\neternity thesis is the most probable in philosophical terms. However,\njust like creation, eternity escapes full demonstration. From the\nstandpoint of faith, the eternity of the world is false and heretical.\nIn his treatise On the Eternity of the World, Thomas Aquinas,\nin contrast to most of his contemporaries, defends the possibility of\nan eternal creation, thus approaching the position of Avicenna and\nother Neoplatonic thinkers.\n\nPositions on the eternity of the world by some masters of arts were in\nsome cases very provocative. In the eyes of Siger of Brabant, the\nnatural philosopher cannot but conclude that the world is eternally\ncreated, whereas the metaphysician concedes that God\u2019s will is\ninscrutable and that hence there is no certainty about eternity or\nnon-eternity (De aeternitate mundi; Quaest. in tertium De\nanima q.2). For Boethius of Dacia, the natural philosopher has to\ninfer the eternity of movement from the principles of natural\nphilosophy, but the metaphysician, even though he can demonstrate the\nexistence of a first cause, is unable to demonstrate whether the world\nis coeternal with the first cause or non-eternal, given the\ninscrutability of God\u2019s will (De aeternitate mundi).\nBoth authors share the conviction that the natural philosopher is\nforced to conclude that the world is eternal, thus provoking\ntheological opposition. The arguments for this conclusion were largely\nfurnished by Arabic sources.\n",
