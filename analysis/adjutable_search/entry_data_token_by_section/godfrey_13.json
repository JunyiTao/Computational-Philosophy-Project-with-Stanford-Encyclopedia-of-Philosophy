    "main_text": "Unicity vs. Plurality of Substantial Form\n14. The Principle of Individuation\n\n\nTogether with many of his contemporaries, Godfrey attempts to\nidentify the principle within material entities that accounts for their\nbeing multiplied numerically within species. In discussing this he\nreturns to the distinction he had drawn in Quodlibet VI, q. 16 between\nthe kind of unity which serves as a principle of number and which is\nbased on discrete quantity, and the kind that is convertible with\nbeing, transcendental unity. Because the substantial form is the\ndetermining principle within a corporeal entity and makes its essence\ncapable of being defined, Godfrey holds that it is by reason of its\nform that such a substance enjoys transcendental unity.\n\n\nNonetheless, in Quodlibet VII, q. 5 he comments that if different\nindividuals within the same species share in the same specific nature,\nthat nature cannot itself serve as the principle that renders them\nnumerically distinct from one another. Something else seems to be\nneeded, perhaps quantity. But to make quantity the principle of\nindividuation will not resolve the problem, for this would be to reduce\nthe principle that distinguishes one substance from others within the\nsame species to the level of an accident. Godfrey notes that in the\ncase of created immaterial beings (angels), their substantial form is\nalso that by which they are individuals. He proposes, therefore, that\nin corporeal substances it is also the substantial form that serves as\ntheir principle of individuation. Nonetheless, quantity has its role to\nplay as well since it is required in order to divide matter into\ndistinct parts and thereby enable it to receive and individuate\nsubstantial forms of the same kind. In other words, quantity disposes\nmatter so as to enable it to function as the material principle of\nindividuation. The formal cause or principle of a thing\u2019s individuation\nis its substantial form. Quantity is not the formal principle of\nindividuation, but by disposing matter so that it can receive different\nsubstantial forms, it may be described as a quasi-material disposing\ncause of individuation (Wippel, 1981, 349\u201364).\n",
