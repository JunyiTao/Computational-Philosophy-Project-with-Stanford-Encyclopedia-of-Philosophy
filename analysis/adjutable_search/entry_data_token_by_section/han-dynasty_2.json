    "main_text": "Western Han (202 BCE\u20139 CE) || Correlative Metaphysics: Chunqiu Fanlu\n2.2 Correlative Metaphysics: Chunqiu Fanlu\n\nThe Chunqiu Fanlu is one of the earliest and most prominent\nHan examples of so-called \u201ccorrelative cosmology\u201d. The\ntext has been traditionally associated with the well-known Han court\nscholar Dong Zhongshu (b. ~195 BCE), an advocate of the tradition\nbased on the Gongyang commentary on the classic history\nChunqiu, a text believed to be essential for understanding\nphilosophy. Three major commentaries on the text, Gongyang,\nZuo, and Guliang, offered different interpretations\nand explanations of the Chunqiu, itself a very sparse and\ndirect text. Different scholastic traditions developed around these\ncommentaries, as groups accepted one or the other of the commentaries\nas authoritative. In early China, particularly in the Han period,\nintellectual \u201cschools\u201d are better understood in terms of\ncommitments to the centrality of certain texts rather than\ncommitment to certain concepts or theories.\n\nIn the Chunqiu Fanlu we also find the development of two\nimportant categories\u2014the \u201cfive phases\u201d (wu\nxing \u4e94\u884c) and yin-yang\n\u9670\u967d\u2014as well as discussion of their connection to\nthe concept of qi \u6c23. The ethical and political content\nof the Chunqiu Fanlu does not differ considerably from the\nstandard \u201cConfucian\u201d views of the time as found in texts\nsuch as those of Lu Jia and Jia Yi, so I here focus on the metaphysics\nof the Chunqiu Fanlu, where we find its most original\ncontribution.\n\nIn what we can call a \u201cnaturalistic shift\u201d in Han thought,\nwhich began in the earlier texts of the late Warring States period\nsuch as the Xunzi, we see a move toward the development of\ncorrelative cosmology and new uses of concepts such as qi\n(vital energy) to explain human behavior and guide ethical and\npolitical activity.\n\nDeveloping an older distinction, the Chunqiu Fanlu uses the\ncontrast of yin and yang, the qualities associated\nwith each, and their transformations, to make sense of properties of\nthe world and humans. One of the key features of this naturalistic\nshift of the Han is the view that \u201cheaven/nature and humanity\nare as one\u201d (tian ren yi ye\n\u5929\u4eba\u4e00\u4e5f, CQFL 49.1). The principles and\npatterns that explain the operation of the natural world, such as\nyin-yang and the five phases, also explain human\ncharacteristics, society, and conduct. There is some debate as to\nwhether yin and yang are something like properties\nof their own that belong to objects and events, or whether they are\nqualities or types of qi. In some parts of the text,\nyin and yang are discussed as if they are particular\nand concrete elements of the world, and in other parts of the text\nyin and yang are discussed as features of\nqi. The Chunqiu Fanlu, unlike earlier Daoist texts,\ntakes a partisan stance here, arguing that we should value\nyang over yin. Yang is associated with\npositive features such as virtue, humanity, and life, while\nyin is understood as absence, and associated with the\nopposing features of vice, violence, and death. This contrasts with\nearlier \u201cDaoist\u201d texts, which generally take yin\nand yang to be mutually valuable principles of change, which\nshould be followed as situations call for. The Chunqiu Fanlu\nargues instead that we should \u201chonor yang and denigrate\nyin\u201d (CQFL 43.1), and that \u201cyang is\nlofty, yin is lowly.\u201d (CQFL 43, Queen & Major 2016:\n393)\n\nEverything from the change of seasons to the movement of planets and\nalternation of emotions can be understood in terms of yin and\nyang. The pair gives us a way to make sense of the\nconstructive and deconstructive aspects involved in any change. We can\nunderstand any change or any state as involving contrastive elements\nthat alternate with one another during change. These two complementary\nand oppositional principles of yin and yang (not\nforces or substances but something more like causally efficacious\nqualities or categories) explain the movement and change of things in\nthe world. In most early Chinese texts, yin and yang\nare given a balanced priority. They are equally responsible for the\nemergence of things, each governs half of the year, the day, and\ngrowth. The Chunqiu Fanlu makes the unusual move of elevating\nthe position of yang, making it responsible for a greater\namount, of more potency, and thus ultimately higher value.\n\nIn addition to yin and yang, the Chunqiu\nFanlu also uses the concept of the \u201cfive phases\u201d\n(wu xing) to understand change. The five phases are at the\ncenter of what is known as correlative cosmology\u2014the\nexplanation of things in the world by reference to their correlative\nassociations with other things. A thing is associated with a\nparticular phase or element, with principles of change built into the\nphases or elements, as each has a transformational principle\ndetermined by the phase into which it changes. Xing \u884c\nis in this context generally translated as \u201cphase\u201d because\nof this focus on change. A phase describes not only the nature of a\nthing in its current state, but more importantly the future states of\nthis thing, that into which it transforms. In this sense, the phases\nhad value as predictive features of things. The five phases\nsituate things with respect to their relationships with other\nthings\u2014in terms of their becoming other things, their location,\nroles, and coordinating activities. Chapter 42 of the Chunqiu\nFanlu explains this use of the phases. After explaining the\nordering of the five phases: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, the\nchapter then discusses their relationships, in terms of\ntransformation, location, reciprocal activity, and reliance.\n\n\nMetal gives birth to fire; fire gives birth to earth; earth gives\nbirth to metal; metal gives birth to water; water gives birth to wood.\nThis is their father-son relationship. Wood dwells on the left; metal\ndwells on the right; fire dwells in the front; water dwells in the\nrear; earth dwells in the center. This is their father-son sequence.\nThe phases receive from and distribute to one another. [\u2026] To\nconstantly rely on the father to direct the son is the Way of Heaven.\nTherefore once wood is born, fire nurtures it; once metal dies, water\nburies it. Fire delights in wood and nourishes it with yang, water\novercomes metal and nourishes it with yin. Earth\u2019s managing of\nthe affairs of fire fully expresses its loyalty. Thus the five phases\nexemplify the conduct of the filial son and loyal minister. (Queen\n& Major [trans] 2016: 367\u20138).\n\n\nWe see here that Chunqiu Fanlu combines the five phases\nexplanation of change and interaction with yin and\nyang principles. Yin and yang operate\nwithin the five phases, and are properties of the phases explaining\ntheir relationships to one another. It is in the Chunqiu\nFanlu that we find the fusion of these two previously distinct\ncorrelative systems in an overarching correlative synthesis (even\nthough the synthesis is not perfect\u2014the systems are still very\nmuch treated separately in particular areas of the text, likely due to\nthe composite nature of the text).\n\nThe five phase makes possible both explanation and prediction. When we\nunderstand the interaction of the five phases, it becomes possible to\nunderstand how things will change, which gives us the ability to make\nuse of them. The phases govern activity as well, including human\nactivity. Through understanding the phases we come to understand which\nkinds of activity will be most effective at performing certain kinds\nof tasks, attaining certain kinds of ends. This is all relevant for\nthose in government, particularly the ruler (such people are the\ntext\u2019s primary audience), as understanding of the phases will\nallow the ruler to properly evaluate and appraise others, knowing who\nto elevate to particular positions, based on their abilities as\ndetermined by the phases.\n",
