    "main_text": "Arguments for Narrow Content || Arguments Concerning Rationality\n3.3 Arguments Concerning Rationality\n\nA related issue is that describing a subject\u2019s beliefs in terms\nof broad content can make them appear irrational even though they are\nnot: when beliefs are described in terms of broad content, they can be\ninconsistent with one another even though the inconsistency is in\nprinciple not discoverable by the subject. A famous example is due to\nSaul Kripke (1979). In Kripke\u2019s example, Pierre, a Frenchman,\ngrows up with a belief he expresses by saying \u201cLondres est\njolie.\u201d This belief has the (broad) content that London is\npretty. Later he moves to England, where he learns English by\nimmersion rather than by translation. He comes to have a second\nbelief, which he expresses in English by saying \u201cLondon is not\npretty.\u201d This belief has the broad content that London is not\npretty. Pierre never realizes that the city he thinks of as Londres\nand the city he thinks of as London are in fact the same city. His two\nbeliefs directly contradict one another, and yet he is not guilty of\nany sort of failure of rationality; it is impossible for him to\nascertain that the two beliefs are contradictory. Kripke himself does\nnot offer a solution to his puzzle and does not discuss narrow\ncontent. But a natural response to the example is to suppose that,\nwhile the belief Pierre accepts and the one he rejects have the same\nbroad content, they have different narrow contents. If so, then the\nsort of content most relevant to determining whether someone\u2019s\nbeliefs and inferences are rational is not broad content but narrow\ncontent.\n\nOne response to this sort of argument is offered by Stalnaker (1990)\nin a critique of Loar (1988). Stalnaker agrees that examples like that\nof Pierre require us to distinguish between the world as it is\naccording to Pierre, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the\npropositions ordinarily expressed by the sentences we use to describe\nthose beliefs, e.g. the proposition that London is pretty. However, in\nhis view it does not follow that an accurate description of the world\naccording to Pierre must be narrow: \u201cI don\u2019t think the\nbelief states themselves \u2014 the ways the world is according to\nthe thinker \u2014 are any less causally and socially infected than\nthe language in which beliefs are ascribed\u201d (p. 203). Jackson\n(2003) responds to Stalnaker\u2019s reasons for skepticism about\nnarrow content.\n",
