    "main_text": "The Arguments for Occasionalism || The Passive Nature Argument\n3.1 The Passive Nature Argument\n\nThe \u201cpassive nature\u201d (hereafter \u201cPN\u201d) argument\naims to establish the occasionalist conclusion for bodies\u2014that\nis, Cartesian extended substances\u2014and only bodies, by focusing\non the characteristic features of these substances. In this respect,\nthe argument appears to be an instance of a \u201clocal\u201d\nargument for occasionalism in that the scope of the argument is\nlimited to a particular type of substance. The argument aims to\nestablish the occasionalist conclusion for some finite\nsubstances, that is, bodies, and not all substances.\n\nThe first passages that stress the lack of activity of bodies as well\nas their lack of ability to initiate movement emerge in the\nSearch (OCM II 312\u20133/Search 448), soon after\nMalebranche\u2019s first statement of his occasionalist thesis. In\nthe Elucidations, mixed together with the claim that the\n\u201cmotor force of bodies is but the will of God,\u201d we are\npresented with the following description of bodies as being\n\u201cpurely passive substances\u201d:\n\nWhen I see one ball strike another, my eyes \u2026 seem to tell me,\nthat the one is truly the cause of the motion it impresses on the\nother \u2026. But when I consult my reason I clearly see that since\nbodies cannot move themselves, and since their motor force is but the\nwill of God that conserves them successively in different places,\nthey cannot communicate a power they do not have and could not\ncommunicate even if it were in their possession. For the mind will\nnever conceive that one body, a purely passive substance, can in any\nway whatsoever transmit to another body the power transporting\nit. (OCM III 208\u20139/Search 660, my\nemphasis)\n\n\nBut why are bodies purely passive substances? The answer, according to\nMalebranche, lies in our idea of extension:\n\nConsult the idea of extension and decide by this idea which represents\nbodies \u2026 whether they can have any property other than the\npassive faculty of receiving various figures and movements.\nIs it not entirely obvious that all the properties of extension can\nconsist only in relations of distance? (OCM XII\n150\u201351/Dialogues 106, my emphasis)\n\n\nThe central point seems as follows: given that all the properties of\nextension are exhausted by relations of distance, it would be a\ncategory mistake, as it were, to ascribe powers to bodies. Powers or\nforces are not properties that bodies can have at all, since powers do\nnot consist in relations of distance. That is, that something\npossesses a motive force and, thus, moves a body or affects a mind\nwould entail that the thing in question is not a body, since there\nwould be more to this thing than relations of distance. The key\npremise here is that causal powers or forces are not relations of\ndistance and, hence, not modes that bodies possess. This assumption\ngets expressed more explicitly in the following argument, which\nreinforces the understanding of bodily \u201cpassivity\u201d as the\nbody\u2019s being constituted by relations of distance alone:\n\nBut that bodies should receive in themselves a certain power, by the\nefficacy of which they could act on the mind\u2014this I do not\nunderstand. For what would this power be? Would it be a substance, or\na modality? If a substance, then bodies will not act, but rather this\nsubstance in bodies. If this power is a modality, then there will be a\nmodality in bodies which will be neither motion nor figure. Extension\nwill be capable of having modalities other than relations of distance.\n(OCM XII 151/Dialogues 107)\n\n\nWith the help of the commonly accepted Scholastic assumption that any\nreal being must either be a substance or mode, Malebranche presents a\nrather clever argument that active powers have no place in bodies (see\nClatterbaugh 1999, 114\u20135). One might wonder what would be so bad\nwith the first option\u2014that is, that of granting the existence of\na separate, distinct substance in bodies responsible for the\nbodies\u2019 activity. But Malebranche\u2019s response is clear:\neven if we bracket the worry of whether we could have a sufficiently\nclear idea of what kind of thing this substance would be, it is\nunlikely that this substance would be a Cartesian extended substance.\nFor it would possess modes or properties other than relations of\ndistance. And in discussing why the second option is going to fail, we\nsee the explicit statement that, though an active power perhaps could\nbe a mode of some other substance, it is not a mode that\nbelongs to bodies, since forces or powers are not relations\nof\n distance.[15]\n\nBut is it obvious that powers or forces are not relations of distance?\nThis question along with the questions about how powers or forces\nrelate to the more obvious properties of extension\u2014for instance,\nsize and shape\u2014raise interesting and important questions that go\nto the heart of the PN argument. The main intuitive\nthrust behind Malebranche\u2019s PN argument is to convince the\nreader that, if we understand the Cartesian conception of matter or\nextension properly, we can see that motive force or power is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for being an extended\n substance.[16]\n This view seem rather close to Descartes\u2019 original insight that\nhaving specific spatial features and standing in particular spatial\nrelations to other bodies are both necessary and sufficient conditions\nto be a bodily\n substance,[17]\n and Malebranche takes this to imply that whether these bodies further\npossess a motive force is an issue peripheral to the basic nature of\nbodies. Such a view seems to be expressed in his discussion of motion\nand rest in the Search:\n\nI am not considering motion and rest here according to their relative\nbeing: for it is obvious that bodies at rest have relations just as\nreal to those around them as those in motion. I conceive only that\nbodies in motion have a motor force, and that those at rest have no\nforce for their state of rest, because the relation of moving bodies\nto those around them is always changing; and therefore there has to be\na continuous force producing these continuous changes, for in effect\nit is these changes which cause everything new that happens in nature.\nBut there need be no force to make nothing happen. When the relation\nof a body to those around it is always the same, nothing happens; and\nthe preservation of this relation, I mean the action of God\u2019s\nwill that preserves this relation, is no different from what preserves\nthe body itself. (OCM II 431\u201332/Search 517)\n\n\nHere we get the impression that Malebranche is thinking that motive\nforce is something additional or added on, as it were, to bodies, and\nthat, in this respect, there is a fundamental difference between the\ntwo modes of motion and rest. In other words, whatever causal\ncontribution is needed on the part of God to bring bodies into\nexistence, there needs to be an additional causal contribution on the\npart of God in the form of a motive force to bring about changes in\nrelations of distance, which occur when bodies are moved. It is as if\nthe default mode of existence for extended substances is to be at\nrest, and motive force is added on through another divine volition,\none that is distinct from the volition that brings the body into\nexistence in the first\n place.[18]\n If so, this understanding of motion and rest fits well with the PN\nargument: motive force is not essential to extension because motive\nforce is not only not a relation of distance but rather some\nadditional feature that is added on to bodies, which are by default at\nrest and passive.\n\nWe end this section with the observation that Malebranche\u2019s\nviews on motion and rest just discussed seems to be at odds with one\nof his global arguments for occasionalism, in particular, the\n\u201cconservation is but continuous creation\u201d argument\n(hereafter referred to the \u201cCCC\u201d argument). For the CCC\nargument strongly suggests a symmetry between God\u2019s act of\ncontinuously creating a body at rest and continuously creating a body\nin motion, since the latter is described as differing from the former\nonly in that, in the latter case, God continuously creates the body in\ndifferent locations over time.\n",
