    "main_text": "Humboldt\u2019s Life || Later Writings: General and Comparative Linguistics\n1.6 Later Writings: General and Comparative Linguistics\n\nAlready in June 1820 he was able to submit to the Berlin Academy a\nbold plan for the creation of the new discipline of comparative\nlinguistics and to outline the philosophy and methodology on which it\nwas to be built in a paper entitled: \u201cOn the Comparative Study\nof Language and its Relation to the Different Periods of Language\nDevelopment\u201d (\u201cUeber das vergleichende Sprachstudium\nin Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der\nSprachentwicklung\u201d, GS Vol 4: 1\u201334). In this compact\nyet highly complex presentation he offered a brief summary of his\nprevious endeavors and proceeded to lay down the principles and the\nblueprint for a comprehensive research program that would guide his\nwork during the following years but at the same time defined the tasks\nof a future linguistics. Humboldt viewed the function of language as\nnot limited simply to representing or communicating existing ideas and\nconcepts but as \u201cformative organ of thought\u201d (das\nbildende Organ des Gedankens, GS Vol 6: 152) and thus\ninstrumental also in the production of new concepts that would not\ncome into being without it. The differences between languages for him\nwere not those of \u201csounds and signs\u201d (Sch\u00e4llen\nund Zeichen) but ultimately of \u201cdifferences of representing\nthe world\u201d (Verschiedenheit der Weltansichten), GS Vol\n4: 27. Therefore it seemed obvious to Humboldt that a categorical\nseparation between philosophy of language and empirical linguistics as\nit developed during the nineteenth century and still exists today, was\nunacceptable. For not only could there be no discipline of linguistics\nwithout a conceptual base and firm philosophical grasp of its\nmany-faceted object of inquiry but, Humboldt maintained, empirical\nresearch into actual language use in different languages with quite\ndiverging structures would provide the philosopher with concrete\ninsights into the nature of human language that would otherwise not be\nattainable. One is reminded here of Kant\u2019s dictum that \u201cconcepts\nwithout intuition\u201d (Anschauung, i.e., empirical\ncontent) \u201care empty and that intuitions without concepts are\nblind.\u201d\n\nHis wide-ranging and ambitious empirical investigations into the\ncosmos of human languages covered practically the entire globe.\nAlexander von Humboldt said about his brother that it had been granted\nto him\n\n\nto penetrate more deeply into the structure of a larger number of\nlanguages as probably have ever been grasped by one human mind.\n(Humboldt 1836: viii)\n\n\nBut Humboldt did not labor by himself in isolation, as some of his\ninterpreters have claimed to this very day, but communicated with and\nentertained lively contacts with leading scholars in both Europe and\nAmerica: with, for example, Franz Bopp in Berlin, August Wilhelm\nSchlegel in Bonn, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion and Jean-Pierre\n R\u00e9musat[2]\n in Paris, Alexander Johnston in London and Peter S. Du Ponceau and\nJohn Pickering in Philadelphia and Boston in the United States.\nHumboldt himself has utilized and understood his correspondence with\nthe leading scholars of the world as an integral part of his ongoing\nresearch work.\n\nHe managed, with the help of his brother Alexander initially, to\nacquire what was probably the largest collection of linguistic\nmaterials in Europe for his time. There was in effect no language\ngroup on the globe that did not attract his attention. Among the\nEuropean and Indo-European languages Humboldt knew and studied\nclassical Greek and Latin, Sanskrit, all of the Romance languages,\nEnglish, Basque, Old Icelandic, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovenian,\nSerbo-Croatian, Armenian but also Hungarian. He was familiar with\nHebrew, Arabic and Coptic (of which he wrote a grammar). From among\nthe Asian languages he studied Chinese, Japanese, Siamese and Tamil.\nYet in the center of his work stood, besides Basque (he is considered\nthe founder of Basque Studies), the native languages of South, Central\nand North America, and increasingly from 1827\u201328 the languages\nof the Pacific from the East Coast of Africa to Hawai\u2018i and the South\nSea Islands. These form what we call today the Austronesian language\ngroup whose existence Humboldt was the first to demonstrate\nconclusively. Among the papers in his remains we find studies, notes,\nanalyses, observations and materials relating to well over two hundred\nlanguages. In his private and public life he mastered and used\n(besides his native German) French, English, Italian and Spanish.\n\nA self-imposed commitment to report on the progress of his research\nefforts to the Berlin Academy at regular intervals induced him to\ndevise his own specific style of presentation that allowed him freely\nand creatively to combine elements of the philosophical essay with\nthose of a scholarly exposition. Among the important of his academy\naddresses marking the progress and direction of his investigations\nbelong his \u201cOn the Task of the Historian\u201d\n(\u201cUeber die Aufgabe des Geschichtsschreibers\u201d) of\n1821 (GS Vol 4: 35\u201356); \u201cOn the Origin of Grammatical\nForms and their Influence on the Development of Ideas\u201d\n(\u201cUeber das Entstehen der grammatischen Formen und ihren\nEinfluss auf die Ideeentwicklung\u201d) of 1822 (GS Vol 4:\n285\u2013313); \u201cOn Alphabetic Script and its Relation to the\nStructure of Language\u201d (\u201cUeber die Buchstabenschrift\nund ihren Zusammenhang mit dem Sprachbau\u201d) of 1824 (GS Vol\n5: 107\u2013133); \u201cOn the Grammatical Structure of the Chinese\nLanguage\u201d (\u201cUeber den grammatischen Bau der\nChinesischen Sprache\u201d) of 1826 (GS Vol 5: 309\u2013325);\n\u201cOn the Dual Form\u201d (\u201cUeber den\nDualis\u201d) of 1827 (GS Vol 6: 4\u201330); \u201cOn the\nLanguages of the South Sea Island\u201d (\u201cUeber die\nSprachen der S\u00fcdseeinseln\u201d) of 1828 (GS Vol 6:\n37\u201351); and two presentations on the Indian Bhagavad-Gita poem\n(Ueber die Bhagavd-Gita) of 1826 (GS Vol 5: 158\u201389; 325\u201344).\nThese and his other presentations formed part of the published\nproceedings of the Berlin Academy.\n\nHis paper \u201cOn the Task of the Historian\u201d, besides dealing\nwith the problems the historian has to confront in writing history,\noffers a theory of historical research that is augmented by\nobservations on the nature of historical understanding. The piece\noccupies a special place in the development of the hermeneutics of the\nhuman sciences. The historian Droysen called Humboldt \u201cthe Bacon\nof the historical sciences\u201d in his influential Historik\n(theory of historical studies) and some of his own concepts and\ndistinctions echo Humboldt\u2019s formulations (Droysen 1958: 324). Whereas\nDroysen speaks of the method of the historian as \u201cunderstanding\nby investigation\u201d (forschendes Verstehen), Humboldt\nsets off historical understanding from mere deductive rational\nprocedures by calling it an assimilation of the investigative\ncapability (forschende Kraft) and the object under\ninvestigation (GS Vol 4: 39). Furthermore, with his notion of a\n\u201cpreexisting basis of understanding\u201d\n(\u201cvorg\u00e4ngige Grundlage des Begreifens\u201d) Humboldt\nclearly anticipated Heidegger\u2019s and Gadamer\u2019s respective notions of an\nontological or historical pre-understanding as necessary condition of\nall formal understanding and interpretation in the human sciences (GS\nVol 4: 48), even though Gadamer in his Truth and Method\ngravely misrepresents the hermeneutic dimensions of Humboldt\u2019s thought\nomitting the fact that for Humboldt (and Schleiermacher) understanding\nwas grounded in language and linguisticality and was perceived by them\nas the correlative of the act of speaking.\n\nIn 1830 Humboldt edited and published his correspondence with the poet\nSchiller and included a lengthy essay \u201cOn Schiller and the Path\nof his Intellectual Development\u201d (\u201cUeber Schiller und\nden Gang seiner Geistesentwicklung\u201d, GS Vol 6:\n492\u2013527). In the same year appeared also an extensive essay on\nthe late Goethe in the form of a review of the concluding part of the\npoet\u2019s Italian Journey that had been published the previous\nyear. There he attempted, as he had done before in his Schiller essay,\nto interpret the various sides of the poet from one central point of\nview: this time from the poet\u2019s perception of art and nature\n(\u201cRezension von Goethes Zweitem r\u00f6mischen\nAufenthalt\u201d, GS Vol 6: 528\u2013550). During the remainder\nof his life most of his time and energy was spent on what was to be\nhis magnum opus: a monumental study of the Kavi Language on\nthe island of Java within the context of the entire Austronesian\nlanguage group of the Pacific. But he was only able to complete the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d and Book 1 of the work. His\nresearch associate Buschmann published these parts in 1836,\nconstituting the first volume of what came to be known as Humboldt\u2019s\nKawi Werk (Kavi-Work). Buschmann also edited and\npublished the remaining two volumes in 1838 and 1839. About this work\nthe American linguist Bloomfield wrote:\n\n\nThe second volume of Humboldt\u2019s great treatise founded the comparative\ngrammar of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. (Bloomfield 1933:\n19)\n\n\nAt the behest of Alexander von Humboldt, who had written a\n\u201cPreface\u201d to the entire work, a separate edition of the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d was brought to publication to serve as a\nmemorial to the deceased, its text shortened and adjusted by the\neditor to its new purpose which made it appear as an independent\ntreatise containing a summary of Humboldt\u2019s theoretical views on\nlanguage. Therefore, the word \u201cIntroduction\u201d was dropped\nfrom its title altogether: The Diversity of Human\nLanguage-Structure and its Influence on the intellectual and spiritual\nDevelopment of Mankind (Ueber die Verschiedenheit des\nmenschlichen Sprachbaus und seinen Einfluss auf die geistige\nEntwickelung des Menschengeschlechts) (Berlin, 1836). This text,\noften confused with the \u201cIntroduction\u201d proper or even with\nthe whole work, became the single most important text for the Humboldt\nreception throughout the nineteenth and much of the twentieth\n century.[3]\n While in this text Humboldt elaborated broadly on his understanding\nof language and human speech, it is no longer evident that he intended\nit as a clearing of the ground for the large-scale empirical\ninvestigations that were to make up the body of the work. Yet from a\nstrictly philosophical perspective this text does not measure up in\nits organization, articulation of issues or its philosophical\nstringency to some of Humboldt\u2019s earlier posthumous treatises. These,\nhowever, were not published until the twentieth century. Among these\ngroundbreaking works (of which no English translations yet exist) must\nbe counted the Grundz\u00fcge des allgemeinen Sprachtypus\n(Fundamentals of the Linguistic Prototype) and Vom\ngrammatischen Baue der Sprachen (On the Grammatical Structure\nof Languages). It is only in the light of twentieth century\nlinguistics, anthropology and philosophy, that is, after Saussure,\nCassirer, Jakobson, Whorf, Chomsky and Wittgenstein, that the true\nscope of Humboldt\u2019s linguistic philosophy has become visible and its\nactuality been perceived. During the nineteenth century Humboldt was\nfor the representatives of the academically established discipline of\nlinguistics with its positivistic historicist and strictly\nIndo-European orientation nothing but the odd man out. What separated\nhim from the mainstream was his philosophically grounded understanding\nof language and linguistics and his decidedly non-Eurocentric\norientation, which preserved the enlightenment Universalist tradition\nby providing it with a new philosophical base.\n\nBefore he died Humboldt bequeathed his entire collection of linguistic\nmaterials, including his own manuscripts, to the Royal Prussian\nLibrary in Berlin so that it would be accessible to the public for\nfurther research. Yet soon after his death in 1835 the integrity of\nthe collection was violated, its contents were divided and dispersed\nand many items sent to different locations. Thus some of Humboldt\u2019s\nbooks, with his marginal comments and annotations, could still be\nfound in general circulation in libraries of the former East Germany.\nIt was also wrongly believed until recently that the greater part of\nthe collection, including Humboldt\u2019s own manuscripts, was destroyed in\nBerlin or otherwise lost during the last months of World War 2.\nThroughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth centuries with few\nexceptions, his papers did not attract the curiosity of professional\nlinguists whose attention was focused mainly on Indo-European\nlanguages. Astonishingly, the extensive body of his posthumous works\nand papers was not ever systematically examined or properly\ncatalogued, let alone studied in depth until recently. As a\nconsequence, all existing editions have virtually excluded Humboldt\u2019s\nempirical work, a situation that will be remedied with the appearance\nof the comprehensive critical edition of Humboldt\u2019s linguistic works\nthat is under way (Humboldt 1994\u2013).\n",
