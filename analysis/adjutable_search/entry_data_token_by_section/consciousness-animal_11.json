Any theory of animal\nconsciousness must be understood, however, in the context of a larger\ninvestigation of animal cognition that (among philosophers) will also\nbe concerned with issues such as intentionality (in the sense\ndescribed by the 19th C. German psychologist Franz Brentano) and\nmental content (Dennett 1983, 1987; Allen 1992a,b).\n\n\nPhilosophical opinion divides over the relation of consciousness to\nintentionality with some philosophers maintaining that they are\nstrictly independent, others (particularly proponents of the\nfunctionalist theories of consciousness described in this section)\narguing that intentionality is necessary for consciousness, and still\nothers arguing that consciousness is necessary for genuine\nintentionality. Many behavioral\nscientists accept cognitivist explanations of animal behavior that\nattribute representational states to their subjects. Yet they remain\nhesitant to attribute consciousness. If the representations invoked\nwithin cognitive science are intentional in Brentano\u2019s sense, then\nthese scientists seem committed to denying that consciousness is\nnecessary for intentionality.\n\nThere remains great uncertainty about the metaphysics of phenomenal\nconsciousness and its precise relations to intentionality, to the\nbrain, to behavior, etc. It is beyond the scope of this article to\nsurvey the strong attacks that have been mounted against the various\naccounts of consciousness in these terms, but it is safe to say that\nnone of them seems secure enough to hang a decisive endorsement or\ndenial of animal consciousness upon it. Accounts of consciousness in\nterms of basic neurophysiological properties, the quantum-mechanical\nproperties of neurons, or sui generis properties of the\nuniverse are just as insecure as the various functionalist\naccounts. And even those accounts that are compatible with animal in\ntheir general outline, are not specific enough to permit ready answers\nto the Distribution Question in its full generality.  Hence no firm\nconclusions about the distribution of consciousness can be drawn on\nthe basis of the philosophical theories of consciousness that have\nbeen discussed so far.\n Where does this leave the epistemological questions about animal\nconsciousness? While it may seem natural to think that we must have a\ntheory of what consciousness is before we try to determine whether\nother animals have it, this may in fact be putting the conceptual cart\nbefore the empirical horse. In the early stages of the scientific\ninvestigation of any phenomenon, putative samples must be identified\nby rough rules of thumb (or working definitions) rather than complete\ntheories. Early scientists identified gold by contingent\ncharacteristics rather than its atomic essence, knowledge of which had\nto await thorough investigation of many putative examples \u2014 some\nof which turned out to be gold and some not. Likewise, at this stage\nof the game, perhaps the study of animal consciousness would benefit\nfrom the identification of animal traits worthy of further\ninvestigation, with no firm commitment to idea that all these examples\nwill involve conscious experience. \nRecall the Cartesian argument that animals do not use language\nconversationally or reason generally. This argument, based on the\nalleged failure of animals to display certain intellectual capacities,\nis illustrative of a general pattern of using certain\ndissimilarities between animals and humans to argue that\nanimals lack consciousness.\n\n\nA common refrain in response to such arguments is that, in situations\nof partial information, \u201cabsence of evidence is not evidence of\nabsence\u201d. Descartes dismissed parrots vocalizing human words\nbecause he thought it was merely meaningless repetition. This judgment\nmay have been appropriate for the few parrots he encountered, but it\nwas not based on a systematic, scientific investigation of the\ncapacities of parrots. Nowadays many would argue that Pepperberg\u2019s\nstudy of the African Grey parrot \u201cAlex\u201d (Pepperberg 1999)\nshould lay the Cartesian prejudice to rest. This study, along with\nseveral on the acquisition of a degree of communicative competence by\nchimpanzees and bonobos (e.g., Gardner et al. 1989;\nSavage-Rumbaugh 1996) would seem to undermine Descartes\u2019 assertions\nabout lack of meaningful communication and general reasoning abilities\nin animals. (See, also, contributions to Hurley & Nudds 2006.)\n\n\nCartesians respond by pointing out the limitations shown by animals in\nsuch studies (they can\u2019t play a good game of chess, after all, let\nalone tell us what they are thinking about), and they join linguists\nin protesting that the subjects of animal-language studies have not\nfully mastered the recursive syntax of natural human\nlanguages.[7]\n But this kind of post hoc raising of\nthe bar suggests to many scientists that the Cartesian position is not\nbeing held as a scientific hypothesis, but as a dogma to be defended\nby any means. Convinced by evidence of sophisticated cognitive\nabilities, most philosophers these days agree with Block that\nsomething like access consciousness is properly attributed to many\nanimals.  Nevertheless, when it comes to phenomenal consciousness,\ndissimilarity arguments are not entirely powerless to give some pause\nto defenders of animal sentience, for surely most would agree that, at\nsome point, the dissimilarities between the capacities of humans and\nthe members of another species (the common earthworm Lumbricus\nterrestris, for example) are so great that it is unlikely that\nsuch creatures are sentient. A grey area arises precisely because no\none can say how much dissimilarity is enough to trigger the judgment\nthat sentience is absent.\nThe aim of picking out, in a principled way, behavioral or\nneurophysiological characteristics that could serve as reliable\nindicators for consciousness motivates the structure and function\noriented approach that many authors have pursued since the turn of the\n21st century. Though sometimes pursued along with metaphysical\nquestions about consciousness, this project promises empirical\ntractability even in the face of persistent uncertainty about the\nmetaphysical questions of consciousness.\n",
