    "main_text": "Applications || Mathematics and Computer Science\n5.2 Mathematics and Computer Science\n\nProof assistants based on Church\u2019s Type Theory, including\nIsabelle/HOL, HOL Light, HOL4, and PVS, have been successfully\nutilized in a broad range of application in computer science and\nmathematics.\n\nApplications in computer science include the verification of hardware,\nsoftware and security protocols. A prominent example is the\nL4.verified project in which Isabelle/HOL was used to formally prove\nthat the seL4 operating system kernel implements an abstract,\nmathematical model specifying of what the kernel is supposed to do\n(Klein et al. 2018). \n\nIn mathematics proof assistants have been applied for the development\nof libraries mathematical theories and the verification of challenge\ntheorems. An early example is the mathematical library that was\ndeveloped since the eighties in the TPS project. A exemplary list of\ntheorems that were proved automatically with TPS is given in Andrews\net al. 1996. A very prominent recent example is Hales Flyspeck in\nwhich HOL Light was employed to develop a formal proof for\nKepler\u2019s conjecture (Hales et al. 2017). An example that\nstrongly exploits automation support in Isabelle/HOL with Sledgehammer\nand Nitpick is presented in Benzm\u00fcller & Scott forthcoming.\nIn this work different axiom systems for category theory were explored\nand compared. \n\nA solid overview on past and ongoing formalization projects can be\nobtained by consulting respective sources such as Isabelle\u2019s\nArchive of Formal Proofs, the Journal of Formalized Reasoning, or the\nTHF entries in Sutcliffe\u2019s TPTP problem library. \n\nFurther improving proof automation within these proof\nassistants\u2014based on proof hammering tools or on other forms of\nprover integration\u2014is relevant for minimizing interaction effort\nin future applications. \n",
