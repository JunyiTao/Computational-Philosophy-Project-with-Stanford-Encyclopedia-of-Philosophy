Freedom to philosophize\n\nIn a letter of 1551 to his patron, the Cardinal of Lorraine, Ramus\nwrote that he had heard a rumor that he was considered to be an\nacademicus, that is, an adherent of the Academic school or,\nin other words, a skeptic, who taught his students to doubt. Although\nRamus firmly rejected this accusation, he had difficulties in clearing\nhimself of the charge (Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes,\nepistolae, orationes, p. 327).\n\nFrom the very beginning he had criticized the scholastics for\nphilosophizing, not in order to reach the truth, but to endorse the\nviews of their master. Ramus accused them of treating Aristotle as\ninfallible and said that in doing so they subordinated their own\nreason to blind faith in authority. In this respect, they were by no\nmeans true Aristotelians, for: \n\n\nAristotle philosophized with the utmost freedom and, for the sake of\nthe truth, he held views with utter freedom, against the entire\ntradition of the past, including his teacher Plato. And he practiced\nthe art of logic not only in short debates but also in continuous\ndisputations, in which both sides of the question were discussed. It\nwas, in fact, his interpreters who rejected the freedom to seek and\ndefend the truth. (Ramus, Scholae, in Scholae in\nliberales artes, col. 29)\n\n\nIf Freigius\u2019 account of the 1536 disputation is correct (see\n \u00a72.2\n above), this was one of the very few occasions when Ramus really did\nattack Aristotle. On the whole, as we have seen, he tried to separate\nAristotle from his later commentators, and he often explained the\nmistakes of Aristotelian philosophy as the result of bad interpreters\nwho had distorted Aristotle\u2019s original meaning. For Ramus, as\nfor other humanists, the scholastics became the villains of the\nstory.\n\nIn the Prior and Posterior Analytics, Aristotle had\nset out a method of attaining reliable knowledge; and in the\nTopics he had dealt with all those instances where it was not\npossible to attain such knowledge. This latter part of logic was\ndominant in the tradition of inventio associated with\nAgricola (see\n \u00a73.2\n above), where the standard practice, attributed to Aristotle by Ramus\nin the passage quoted above, was to discuss both sides of a question\n(in utramque partem disserere). This describes a\nconfrontational situation where one side argues against another,\nresulting in the victory of one or the other position. In such\ncircumstances, however, you can never say that the side which triumphs\nis the absolute winner, though you can come fairly close to a\ndefinitive resolution. In dialectical argumentation, therefore, we\nmust be satisfied with probabilities. But if the very best we can\nattain is probability, the knowledge we reach is not as certain as\nthat which results from a scientific demonstration. Consequently, it\nis more difficult to be fanatically devoted to a particular opinion.\nIn the wake of humanism, ancient skepticism had its own renaissance.\nRamus, however, in line with the majority of humanists, was more of an\neclectic than a skeptic. He regarded Galen as his ideal since he had\nborrowed from earlier thinkers what he considered to be good and\nuseful for his own theories (Ramus, Dialectica 1569: 11 and\n27).\n\nAdopting radical skepticism in this period would have laid Ramus open\nto the serious charge of holding dangerous philosophical or\ntheological views and even of atheism. It was therefore imperative for\nhim to refute this accusation. To his patron, the cardinal, who had\nexpressed concern over the claim that Ramus was an\nacademicus, he explained that the academici were\nmerely eclectics, who \n\n\ndiffer from other philosophers as free men differ from slaves, as the\nwise differ from the reckless and as the steadfast differ from the\nobstinate. \n\n\nNot surprisingly, Ramus declared that he would rather be a philosopher\nthan the slave of a philosopher (Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes,\nepistolae, orationes, pp. 55 and 89). There was no danger in\nallowing men to think freely, he maintained, since true reason can\nnever be wrong. As long as we used our ability to understand the\nnatural order, everything would turn out well in the end. Risks arose\nwhen we did not dare to trust our own reason but instead, like the\nscholastics, uncritically adopted the opinions of others.\n\nRamus\u2019 belief in the freedom to philosophize and his eclecticism\ncaused difficulties for his followers. If they showed too much\nenthusiasm for Ramus\u2019 ideas, would they not also be accused of\nbeing the slaves of their master? Ramus himself was aware of this\nproblem, a kind of \u201cCatch 22\u201d situation. \u201cWhat\nprevents us\u201d, he wrote, \n\n\nfrom briefly playing Socrates and, having left aside all our trust in\nAristotelian authority, asking: is this the true and correct art of\ndialectic? Perhaps the Philosopher deceives us with his authority?\n(Ramus, Scholae dialecticae, in Scholae in liberales\nartes, col. 155) \n\n\nHere we see the great respect that Ramus and his adherents had for\nSocrates, whom they regarded as their hero. Ramus associated his own\ndialectical procedure with the method used by Socrates, \n\n\nwhose main intention was to draw those with whom he debated away from\nviews based on opinions and the testimonies of other people and to\nlead them toward mental composure and freedom of judgement \u2026.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nAlthough his followers preferred to call their philosophy Socratic\nrather than Ramist, in order to avoid the accusation of slavish trust\nin his authority, this tactic was not very successful. One of his most\ndevoted disciples, Guilielmus Adolphus Scribonius, attacked another\nRamist for departing from the teaching of the Dialectica and\nfor criticizing Ramus. Yet, at the same time, he emphatically declared\nthat every adherent of Ramist philosophy must swear to the principle\nof libertas philosophandi, the freedom to philosophize.\nScribonius was certainly aware of the difficulty of striking a balance\nbetween total freedom and permitting support for a particular school.\nHe tried to resolve it by maintaining that while all philosophers were\nto some degree wrong, Ramus, like Socrates, had almost always been\nright. By adopting this position, however, he took some of the sting\nout of his own criticism of the insufficiently faithful Ramist, as the\nlatter was quick to point out (Sellberg 1979: 106\u2013107).\n\nNeither Ramus nor his followers felt able to extend this freedom to\ntheological questions, though their scholastic opponents accused them\nof having done so. In the end, they had to concede so many\nrestrictions on the freedom to philosophize that hardly anything\nremained.\n",
