    "main_text": "Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations || Reason and empirical truth\n1.1 Reason and empirical truth\n\nReason has an important role in our pursuit of knowledge. Kant writes:\n\u201cthe law of reason to seek unity is necessary, since without it\nwe would have no reason, and without that, no coherent use of the\nunderstanding, and, lacking that, no sufficient mark of empirical\ntruth\u2026\u201d\n (A651/B679).[3]\n Kant says relatively little to develop this claim, and the issue has\nnot attracted much commentary. (But cf. Walker 1989: Ch. 4; Guyer and\nWalker 1990;\n Kant\u2019s theory of judgment,\n \u00a71.3.)[4]\n\nHowever, the basic idea is clear from his text. We form judgments\nabout the world around us all the time. We see a hand in front of us\nand judge it to exist; after a dream, we judge ourselves to have been\ndreaming and the dream\u2019s contents to be illusory; we see the sun\nrise and assume that it orbits the earth. (Obviously this last\njudgment is false: see\n \u00a71.2\n below.) Kant devotes much effort to show how all these judgments rely\non categories. Fundamental concepts such as cause and effect\nstructure all our judgments. A belief that conforms to these\ncategories meets the \u201cformal\u201d conditions of truth.\nHowever, unless we are fundamentally confused about something, all our\nbeliefs meet these\n conditions.[5]\n So how do we decide which of our beliefs are true, and which\nmistaken?\n\nKant begins by noting that only judgments can be mistaken:\n\u201cIt is correctly said that the senses do not err; yet not\nbecause they always judge correctly, but because they do not judge at\nall\u201d (A293). For example, there is no error involved in\ndreaming, however incoherent or fantastical the dream may be. But if\nsomeone got confused and supposed that a dreamed-of event had really\nhappened, then she would be making a judgment\u2014a false one. So\nKant claims, \u201cerror is only effected through the unnoticed\ninfluence of sensibility on understanding, through which it happens\nthat the subjective grounds of the judgment join with the objective\nones\u201d (A294). In the example, someone confuses a subjective\nground of judgment (\u201cI had this dream\u201d) with an\nobjective one (\u201cthese events took place\u201d). As\nKant puts it in the Prolegomena:\n\nThe difference between truth and dream\u2026 is not decided through\nthe quality of the representations that are referred to objects, for\nthey are the same in both, but through their connection according to\nrules that determine the combination of representations in the concept\nof an object, and how far they can or cannot stand together in one\nexperience. (4:290)\n\n\nHow does reasoning help here? In the famous \u201cRefutation of\nIdealism\u201d (added to the second edition of the Critique of\nPure Reason), Kant writes: \u201cWhether this or that putative\nexperience is not mere imagination [or dream or delusion, etc.] must\nbe ascertained according to its particular determinations and through\nits coherence with the criteria of all actual experience\u201d\n(B279).\n\nTo see what Kant means, consider a simple example. Suppose that our\ndreamer believes they have won a lottery, but then starts to doubt\nthis belief. To decide whether it is true, they must ask how far such\na belief connects up with their other judgments, and those of other\n people.[6]\n If it fails to connect up (they check the winning numbers, perhaps,\nand find no match with the actual ticket), the dreamer must conclude\nthat the belief was false.\n\nWe can also see the logic here in terms of Kant\u2019s claim that\nreason is \u201cthe faculty of the unity of the rules of\nunderstanding under principles\u201d (A302/B359). One fundamental\nprinciple of experience is that we inhabit a single world in space and\ntime. Therefore, all true judgments must find a place within a single,\nunified experience of the world. Reason seeks consistency. It helps\nseparate factual mistakes from genuine knowledge by referring to this\nunifying condition.\n",
