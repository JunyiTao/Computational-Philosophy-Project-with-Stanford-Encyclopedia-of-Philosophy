    "main_text": "Some Themes in Strawson\u2019s Writings || Scepticism and knowledge\n10. Conclusion\n\nStrawson did not seek to make disciples, nor did he write too much by\nway of defence of his views against critics (except, as it were, when\nhe had to). However, he produced a continuous flow of original and\nprofound, and elegantly expressed, philosophy dealing with a very\nbroad range of topics. He thereby exerted a considerable influence on\nphilosophy, both during his lifetime and, indeed, since his death.\n",
