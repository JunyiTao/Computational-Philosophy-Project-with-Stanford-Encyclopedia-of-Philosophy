Conclusion: Beyond \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d\n\nIf one turns to metaphysics in the twentieth century and beyond, it\nbecomes necessary to distinguish \u201cPhilosophy in China\u201d\nfrom \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d. Like almost everywhere else in\nthe world, the twentieth century in China was characterized by the\nincorporation of ideas from other cultures, most obviously from\nEurope. The terms \u201cphilosophy\u201d and\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d were introduced as distinct concepts through\ntranslation and thus they become the objects of conscious reflection.\nEven scholars dedicated to \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d set\nthemselves in dialogue with the West, so that almost all philosophy\nwas more or less intercultural. The main influences from Europe were\nKant, Hegel, and Marx, but a wide range of philosophers were\nincorporated, including Nietzsche, Bergson, Dewey, and Heidegger.\nAlmost all of the major philosophers in China\u2014from Xiong Shili\n\u718a\u5341\u529b (1885\u20131968) to Feng Youlan\n\u99ae\u53cb\u862d (1895\u20131990) to Mou Zongsan\n\u725f\u5b97\u4e09 (1909\u20131995)\u2014were concerned with\nestablishing a metaphysical foundation for Chinese\n Philosophy.[13]\n These philosophers, drawing on resources from multiple cultures and\ntraditions, are better suited for an entry on\n\u201cMetaphysics\u201d than one on \u201cMetaphysics in Chinese\nPhilosophy\u201d.\n",
