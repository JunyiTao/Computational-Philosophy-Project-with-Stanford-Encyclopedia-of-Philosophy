    "main_text": "Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms || The Vienna Circle and History\n3.7 The Vienna Circle and History\n\nMuch confusion exists concerning the Vienna Circle and history, that\nis, both concerning the Vienna Circle\u2019s attitude towards the\nhistory of philosophy and science and concerning its own place in that\nhistory. As more has been learnt about the history of the Vienna\nCircle itself\u2014the development and variety of its doctrines as\nwell as its own prehistory as a philosophical forum\u2014this\nconfusion can be addressed more adequately.\n\nAs the unnamed villain of the opening sentences of Kuhn\u2019s\ninfluential Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962),\nlogical empiricism is often accused of lacking historical\nconsciousness and any sense of the embedding of philosophy and science\nin the wider culture of the day. Again it can hardly be denied that\nmuch logical empiricist philosophy, especially after World War II, was\nahistorical in outlook and asocial in its orientation.\nReichenbach\u2019s distinction (1938) between the contexts of\ndiscovery and justification\u2014which echoed distinctions made since\nKant (Hoyningen-Huene 1987) and was already observed under a different\nname by Carnap in the Aufbau\u2014was often employed to\nshield philosophy not only from contact with the sciences as practiced\nbut also culture at large. But this was not the case for the Vienna\nCircle generally. On the one hand, unlike Reichenbach, who drew a\nsharp break between traditional philosophy and the new philosophy of\nlogical empiricism in his popular The Rise of Scientific\nPhilosophy (1951), Schlick was very much concerned to stress the\nremaining continuities with traditional philosophy and its cultural\nmission in his last paper (1938). On the other hand, on the left wing\nof the Circle scientific meta-theory was opened to the empirical\nsciences. To be sure, Carnap for his own part was happy to withdraw to\nthe \u201cicy slopes\u201d of the logic of science and showed no\nresearch interest of his own in the history of science or philosophy,\nlet alone its social history. By way of the division of labor he left\nit to Neurath and Frank to pursue the historical and practice-related\nsociological questions that the pure logic of science had to leave\nunaddressed. (See, e.g., Neurath\u2019s studies of the history of\noptics (1915, 1916), Frank\u2019s homage to Mach (1917), his\npedagogical papers in (1949b) and his concern with the practice of\ntheory acceptance and change in (1956); cf. Uebel 2000 and Nemeth\n2007.) Moreover, it must be noted that Neurath himself all along had\nplanned a volume on the history of science for the International\nEncyclopedia of Science, a volume that in the end became Kuhn\u2019s\nStructure. Its publication in this series is often regarded as supremely ironical, given\nhow Kuhn\u2019s book is commonly read. But this is not only to\noverlook that the surviving editors of that series, Carnap and Morris\nwere happy to accept the manuscript, but also that Carnap found himself in\npositive agreement with Kuhn (Reisch 1991, Irzik and\nGrunberg 1995; cf. Friedman 2001). Finally, one look at the 1929\nmanifesto shows that its authors were very aware of and promoted the\nlinks between their philosophy of science and the socio-political and\ncultural issues of the day.\n\nTurning to the historical influences on the Vienna Circle itself, the\nscholarship of recent decades has unearthed a much greater variety\nthan was previously recognized. Scientifically, the strongest\ninfluences belonged to the physicists Helmholtz, Mach and Boltzmann,\nthe mathematicians Hilbert and Klein and the logicians Frege and\nRussell; amongst contemporaries, Einstein was revered above all\nothers. The Circle\u2019s philosophical influences extend far beyond\nthat of the British empiricists (especially Hume), to include the\nFrench conventionalists Henri Poincar\u00e9, Pierre Duhem and Abel\nRey, American pragmatists like James and, in German-language\nphilosophy, the Neo-Kantianism of both the Heidelberg and the Marburg\nvariety, even the early phenomenology of Husserl as well as the\nAustrian tradition of Bolzano\u2019s logic and the Brentano school.\n(See Frank 1949a for the influence of the French conventionalists; for the importance of\nNeo-Kantianism for Carnap, see Friedman 1987, 1992, Sauer 1989,\nRichardson 1998, Mormann 2007; for Neo-Kantianism in Schlick, see\nCoffa 1991, Ch. 9 and Gower 2000; for the significance of Husserl for\nCarnap, see Sarkar 2004, Ryckman 2007, Carus 2016, Damb\u00f6ck 2018; for the influence of and sympathies for pragmatism see Frank 1949a and Uebel 2016; the Bolzano-Brentano\nconnection is explored in Haller 1986.) It is against this very wide\nbackground of influences that the seminal force must be assessed that\ntheir contemporary Wittgenstein exerted. The literature on the\nrelation between Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle is vast but very\noften suffers from an over-simplified conception of the latter. (See\nStern 2007 for an attempt by a Wittgenstein scholar to redress the\nbalance.) Needless to say, different wings of the Circle show these\ninfluences to different degrees. German Neo-Kantianism was important\nfor Schlick and particularly so for Carnap, whereas the Austrian\nnaturalist-pragmatist influences were particularly strong on Hahn,\nFrank and Neurath. Frege was of great importance for Carnap, less so\nfor Hahn who looked to Russell. Most importantly, by no means all\nmembers of the Vienna Circle sought to emulate Wittgenstein\u2014thus\nthe division between the faction around Schlick and the left wing (see Uebel 2017).\n\nWhile these findings leave numerous questions open, they nevertheless refute the standard picture of Vienna Circle philosophy which confuses A.J. Ayer\u2019s\nLanguage, Truth and Logic with the real thing. Ayer offered a version of British empiricism (Berkeley\u2019s epistemic phenomenalism updated with Russellian logic) and paid no attention, for instance, to the Circle\u2019s overarching concern with establishing\nthe objectivity claim of science. Ayer\u2019s remark in the\npreface to his later anthology Logical Positivism that his own Language, Truth and Logic \u201cdid\nsomething to popularize what may be called the classical position of\nthe Vienna Circle\u201d (1959b, 8) is highly misleading therefore. What he\ncalled \u201cthe classical position\u201d was at best a partial characterisation of the starting\nposition of some\u2014by no means all\u2014of its members, a position which by 1932 the left\nwing as a whole rejected and even Schlick had no reason to\nendorse any longer.\n\nAll that said by way of embedding the Vienna Circle\u2019s philosophy\nin its time, one must also ask whether its members understood their\nown position correctly. Here one issue in particular has become\nincreasingly prominent and raises questions that are of importance for\nphilosophy of science still today. That is whether, after all, logical\nempiricism did have the resources to understand correctly the then\nparadigm modern science, the general theory of relativity. According\nto the standard logical empiricist story (Schlick 1915, 1917, 1921,\n1922), their theory conclusively refuted the Kantian conception of the\nsynthetic a priori: Euclidean geometry was not only one\ngeometry amongst many, it also was not the one that characterized\nempirical reality. With one of its most prominent exemplars refuted,\nthe synthetic a priori was deemed overthrown altogether. As\nnoted, Schlick convinced the young Reichenbach to drop his residually\nKantian talk of constitutive principles and speak of conventions\ninstead. Likewise Schlick rejected efforts by Ernst Cassirer (see his\n1921, developing themes from his 1910) to make do with a merely\nrelative a priori in helping along scientific\nself-reflection. Even though much later, and on the independent\ngrounds of quantum physics, Frank attested to the increased proximity\nof his and Cassirer\u2019s understanding of scientific theories\n(1938), Schlick\u2019s disregard of Cassirer\u2019s efforts remains\nnotable.\n\nMost controversial is how the issue of general relativity as a\ntouchstone for competing philosophies of science was framed: having\ndismissed Kant\u2019s own synthetic a priori for its\nmistaken apodicity, no time was spared for discussion of its then\ncontemporary development in Neo-Kantianism as a merely relative but\nstill constitutive a priori. Now in the philosophy of\nphysics, this omission\u2014committed both by Schlick and\nReichenbach\u2014has recently come back to haunt logical empiricists\nwith considerable vengeance. Thus it has been argued that the\nSchlick-Reichenbach reading of general relativity as embodying the\nstandard logical empiricist model of scientific theories, with high\ntheory linked to its observational strata by purely conventional\ncoordinative definitions, is deeply mistaken in representing the local\nmetric of space-time not to be empirically but conventionally\ndetermined as in special relativity (Ryckman 1992) and that\nit is instead only the tradition of transcendental idealism that\npossesses the resources to understand the achievements of mathematical\nphysics (Ryckman 2005; cf. Friedman 2001). It is tempting to speak of\nthe return of the repressed Neo-Kantian opposition. But it is tempting\ntoo to note that Schlick\u2019s and Reichenbach\u2019s mistake was\nalready corrected quietly and without fanfare by Carnap (see the\nexample in his 1934/37, \u00a750). Clearly then, the mistake was not\ninevitable and inherent in logical empiricist theorizing about\nscience as such. (For discussion of different criticism of the Circle\u2019s reading of Einstein, especially his relation to Mach, see DiSalle 2006, Ch.4.)\n\nThe charge of a constitutive failing would rather seem to come from\nDemopoulos\u2019s challenge to the two-languages model (nearly)\nuniversally adopted in logical empiricism (forthcoming). Importantly,\nthis challenge does not proceed, as some previous ones have, from the\nimpossibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the observational and the theoretical (Putnam\n1962). Rather, the two-languages model falsely supposes that the\nprocess of testing scientific hypotheses must only advert to\ntheoretically uncontaminated facts and so results in misunderstanding\nthe empirical import of theoretical claims (as in the Newman problem).\nInstead, a conception of theory-mediated measurement and testing is\nsuggested that extends responsiveness to observational data to\ntheoretical claims by showing them to be essentially implicated in the\nproduction of observed experimental consequences. Hoping to advance\nbeyond the stalemate between realism and instrumentalism without\nappealing to question-begging semantics, Demopoulos here breaks with a\nsupposition upheld by Carnap throughout, namely that the theoretical\nlanguage be regarded as an essentially uninterpreted, at best partially\ninterpreted calculus. Whatever the outcome of this challenge, it is\nremarkable how on this far-reaching and fundamental issue contemporary\nphilosophy of science intersects with the history of philosophy of\nscience.\n",
