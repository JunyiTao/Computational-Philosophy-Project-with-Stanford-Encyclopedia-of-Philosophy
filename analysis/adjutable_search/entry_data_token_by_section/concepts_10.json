    "main_text": "Empiricism and nativism about concepts\n3. Empiricism and nativism about concepts\n\nOne of the oldest questions about concepts concerns whether there are\nany innate concepts and, if so, how much of the conceptual system is\ninnate. Empiricists maintain that there are few if any innate concepts\nand that most cognitive capacities are acquired on the basis of a few\nrelatively simple general-purpose cognitive mechanisms. Nativists, on\nthe other hand, maintain that there may be many innate concepts and\nthat the mind has a great deal of innate differentiation into complex\ndomain-specific subsystems.\n",
