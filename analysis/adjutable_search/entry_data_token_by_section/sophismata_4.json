    "main_text": "The Various Roles of Sophismata\n3. The Various Roles of Sophismata\n\nThe first and most evident role of sophismata is pedagogical.\nIn theoretical treatises, sophismata can play various roles.\nThey can be used to explain a given statement or rule, illustrate a\ndistinction or an ambiguity, show what would follow if a rule were\nviolated, or test the limits of a theory.\n\nIn addition, although some differences can be identified between the\nParis and the Oxford traditions, sophismata are important as\noral exercises (disputations) in a student\u2019s training in\nphilosophy, especially in the first years of universitary education in\nthe Faculty of Arts. Nevertheless, it is clear that, while\nHeytesbury\u2019s Rules for Solving Sophismata is written\nfor undergraduate students \u2014 at Oxford\n\u2018sophista\u2019 was the official name given to\nstudents who had disputed \u201con sophismata\u201d\n(\u201cde sophismatibus\u201d) for about two years \u2014\nthis is probably not the case for his Sophismata, in which\nthe discussions are much more complicated.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the study of sophismata in\nthe Faculty of Arts was as important as biblical exegesis in the\nFaculty of Theology.\n",
