One Concept of Liberty: Freedom as a Triadic Relation\n\nThe two sides identified by Berlin disagree over which of two\ndifferent concepts best captures the political ideal of\n\u2018liberty\u2019. Does this fact not denote the presence of some\nmore basic agreement between the two sides? How, after all,\ncould they see their disagreement as one about the nature of liberty\nif they did not think of themselves as in some sense talking about\nthe same thing? In an influential article, the American legal\nphilosopher Gerald MacCallum (1967) put forward the following answer:\nthere is in fact only one basic concept of freedom, on which both\nsides in the debate converge. What the so-called negative and\npositive theorists disagree about is how this single concept of\nfreedom should be interpreted. Indeed, in MacCallum\u2019s view,\nthere are a great many different possible interpretations of freedom,\nand it is only Berlin\u2019s artificial dichotomy that has led us to\nthink in terms of there being two.\n\nMacCallum defines the basic concept of freedom \u2014 the concept on\nwhich everyone agrees \u2014 as follows: a subject, or agent, is free\nfrom certain constraints, or preventing conditions, to do or become\ncertain things. Freedom is therefore a triadic relation \u2014 that\nis, a relation between three things: an agent, certain\npreventing conditions, and certain doings or becomings of the agent.\nAny statement about freedom or unfreedom can be translated into a\nstatement of the above form by specifying what is free or\nunfree, from what it is free or unfree, and what it is free\nor unfree to do or become. Any claim about the presence or\nabsence of freedom in a given situation will therefore make certain\nassumptions about what counts as an agent, what counts as a constraint\nor limitation on freedom, and what counts as a purpose that the agent\ncan be described as either free or unfree to carry out.\n\nThe definition of freedom as a triadic relation was first put forward\nin the seminal work of Felix Oppenheim in the 1950s and 60s. Oppenheim\nsaw that an important meaning of \u2018freedom\u2019 in the context\nof political and social philosophy was as a relation between two\nagents and a particular (impeded or unimpeded) action. However,\nOppenheim\u2019s interpretation of freedom was an example of what\nBerlin would call a negative concept. What MacCallum did was to\ngeneralize this triadic structure so that it would cover all possible\nclaims about freedom, whether of the negative or the positive variety.\nIn MacCallum\u2019s framework, unlike in Oppenheim\u2019s, the\ninterpretation of each of the three variables is left open. In other\nwords, MacCallum\u2019s position is a meta-theoretical one: his is a\ntheory about the differences between theorists of freedom.\n\nTo illustrate MacCallum\u2019s point, let us return to the example of\nthe smoker driving to the tobacconists. In describing this person as\neither free or unfree, we shall be making assumptions about each of\nMacCallum\u2019s three variables. If we say that the driver is\nfree, what we shall probably mean is that an agent,\nconsisting in the driver\u2019s empirical self, is free from external\n(physical or legal) obstacles to do whatever he or she might want to\ndo. If, on the other hand, we say that the driver is unfree,\nwhat we shall probably mean is that an agent, consisting in a higher\nor rational self, is made unfree by internal, psychological\nconstraints to carry out some rational, authentic or virtuous plan.\nNotice that in both claims there is a negative element and a positive\nelement: each claim about freedom assumes both that freedom\nis freedom from something (i.e., preventing conditions)\nand that it is freedom to do or become something.\nThe dichotomy between \u2018freedom from\u2019 and \u2018freedom\nto\u2019 is therefore a false one, and it is misleading to say that\nthose who see the driver as free employ a negative concept and those\nwho see the driver as unfree employ a positive one. What these two\ncamps differ over is the way in which one should interpret each of the\nthree variables in the triadic freedom-relation. More precisely, we\ncan see that what they differ over is the extension to be\nassigned to each of the variables.\n\nThus, those whom Berlin places in the negative camp typically conceive\nof the agent as having the same extension as that which it is\ngenerally given in ordinary discourse: they tend to think of the agent\nas an individual human being and as including all of the empirical\nbeliefs and desires of that individual. Those in the so-called\npositive camp, on the other hand, often depart from the ordinary\nnotion, in one sense imagining the agent as more extensive than in the\nordinary notion, and in another sense imagining it as less extensive:\nthey think of the agent as having a greater extension than in ordinary\ndiscourse in cases where they identify the agent\u2019s true desires\nand aims with those of some collectivity of which she is a member; and\nthey think of the agent as having a lesser extension than in ordinary\ndiscourse in cases where they identify the true agent with only a\nsubset of her empirical beliefs and desires \u2014 i.e., with those\nthat are rational, authentic or virtuous. Secondly, those in\nBerlin\u2019s positive camp tend to take a wider view of what counts\nas a constraint on freedom than those in his negative camp: the set of\nrelevant obstacles is more extensive for the former than for the\nlatter, since negative theorists tend to count only external obstacles\nas constraints on freedom, whereas positive theorists also allow that\none may be constrained by internal factors, such as irrational\ndesires, fears or ignorance. And thirdly, those in Berlin\u2019s\npositive camp tend to take a narrower view of what counts as a purpose\none can be free to fulfill. The set of relevant purposes is less\nextensive for them than for the negative theorists, for we have seen\nthat they tend to restrict the relevant set of actions or states to\nthose that are rational, authentic or virtuous, whereas those in the\nnegative camp tend to extend this variable so as to cover any action\nor state the agent might desire.\n\nOn MacCallum\u2019s analysis, then, there is no simple dichotomy\nbetween positive and negative liberty; rather, we should recognize\nthat there is a whole range of possible interpretations or\n\u2018conceptions\u2019 of the single concept of liberty. Indeed, as\nMacCallum says and as Berlin seems implicitly to admit, a number of\nclassic authors cannot be placed unequivocally in one or the other of\nthe two camps. Locke, for example, is normally thought of as one of\nthe fathers or classical liberalism and therefore as a staunch\ndefender of the negative concept of freedom. He indeed states\nexplicitly that \u2018[to be at] liberty is to be free from restraint\nand violence from others\u2019. But he also says that liberty is not\nto be confused with \u2018license\u2019, and that \u201cthat ill\ndeserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and\nprecipices\u201d (Second Treatise, parags. 6 and 57). While\nLocke gives an account of constraints on freedom that Berlin would\ncall negative, he seems to endorse an account of MacCallum\u2019s\nthird freedom-variable that Berlin would call positive, restricting\nthis variable to actions that are not immoral (liberty is not license)\nand to those that are in the agent\u2019s own interests (I am not\nunfree if prevented from falling into a bog). A number of contemporary\nliberals or libertarians have provided or assumed definitions of\nfreedom that are similarly morally loaded (e.g. Nozick 1974; Rothbard\n1982; Bader 2018). This would seem to confirm MacCallum\u2019s claim\nthat it is conceptually and historically misleading to divide\ntheorists into two camps \u2014 a negative liberal one and a positive\nnon-liberal one.\n",
