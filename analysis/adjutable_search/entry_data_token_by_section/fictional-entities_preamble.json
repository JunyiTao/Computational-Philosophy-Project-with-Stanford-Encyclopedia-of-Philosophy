    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical issues surrounding fiction have attracted increasing\nattention from philosophers over the past few decades. What follows is\na discussion of one familiar and quite fundamental topic in this area:\nfictional entities (both the issue of what such entities might be like\nand whether there really are such entities).\n\nA familiar characteristic of works of fiction is that they feature\nfictional characters: individuals whose exploits are written about in\nworks of fiction and who make their first appearance in a work of\nfiction. Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, for example, features\nthe fictional character Hamlet, Doyle\u2019s A Study in\nScarlet features Sherlock Holmes, Tolstoy\u2019s Anna\nKarenina features Anna Karenina, and so on. All of these works\nfeature numerous other fictional characters, of course (Ophelia and Dr\nWatson, for example); indeed, some works of fiction are characterized\nby the sheer abundance of their characters (Russian novels are often\nsaid to have this characteristic). Fictional characters belong to the\nclass of entities variously known as fictional entities or\nfictional objects or ficta, a class that includes\nnot just animate objects of fiction (fictional persons, animals,\nmonsters, and so on) but also inanimate objects of fiction such as\nfictional places (Anthony Trollope\u2019s cathedral town of\nBarchester and Tolkien\u2019s home of the elves, Rivendell, for\nexample). As stated, however, it doesn\u2019t include entities\nlocated in the real world, although real entities do have an important\nrole to play in works of fiction. Thus, neither London nor Napoleon\nare fictional entities, but the first is the quite essential backdrop\nto what goes on in the Holmes stories while the second plays an\nimportant role in the events described in War and Peace.\n(While London and Napoleon are not fictional entities, some have\nthought that the London of the Holmes stories and the Napoleon of\nWar and Peace should be classed as special fictional\nentities. This view has recently gained some popularity: cf. Landini\n1990, Bonomi 2008, Voltolini 2006, 2013, 2020b, Motoarca 2014.)\n\nThe above characterization suggests that fictional entities constitute\na special type of entity. Not surprisingly, then, one fundamental\nphilosophical question we can ask about fictional entities is a\nquestion about their nature: what kind of thing is a\nfictional entity? This question is separate from what seems an even\nmore fundamental question: why suppose that there are any\nfictional entities in the first place? After all, our world never\ncontained a Sherlock Holmes or a Rivendell\u2014these alleged\nentities make their appearance in works of fiction, not works\nof fact. Following the division in Thomasson 1999, we shall\ncall the first question the metaphysical question, and the\nsecond the ontological question.\n",
