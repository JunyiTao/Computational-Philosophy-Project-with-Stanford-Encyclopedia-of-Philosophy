Perception\n\nTraditionally, modal epistemologists have assumed that we cannot gain\nknowledge of modality by investigating what is actually the case (see,\ne.g., Craig 1985; Peacocke 1999). In particular, it seems that our\nperceptual capacities on their own cannot yield knowledge of\nwhat is possible and necessary. Perception, so the story goes, shows\nus at best how things are, not how they could have been or must be. If\nnecessity is truth in all possible worlds, and perception\nonly provides us with evidence for how the actual world is, how can we\nperceive necessity? Similarly, if non-actualized possibilities have no\ntruth-maker in the actual world, since they are non-actualized, how\ncan we perceive possibility? One might infer from how things\nare that they might be a certain way, but how can one perceive how\nthings merely could be? In light of these considerations,\nperception has been thought to be categorically inappropriate for\ngaining modal knowledge. Recently, modal epistemologists have\nchallenged the traditional stance. In particular, some have switched\nthe focus of the epistemology of modality from far out claims about\nthe possibility of zombie worlds to every-day modal claims, such as\nwhether the couch could make it up the stairs, or that Joel can climb\nthe boulder.\n\nMargot Strohminger (2015) uses practical examples of modal knowledge\nto challenge the idea that we cannot perceive possibility. For\nexample, at least in some instances we seem to be able to see\nthat we can climb a tree (even if we have not yet climbed\nit), or that we can reach a certain mug (even though we have not yet\ntried). In Strohminger\u2019s view, one literally perceives the\npossibility, rather than seeing something first and then making a\n(possibly tacit) inference on the basis of what one sees. Importantly,\na defense of the pure perception of possibility requires a view of\nperception where something more than low level properties, such as\ncolor and shape, are present in perception. One class of views on\nwhich perception provides more than just low-level properties are\naffordance theories, due to Gibson (1979). On an affordance view, one\nmay hold that possibility is part of what we perceive. For example,\nIris sees that the door knob can be turned.\n\nBarbara Vetter has recently expanded her work on the metaphysics of\npotentiality (2015) and developed a perceptual account of modal\nknowledge based on every-day cases and affordance views of perception\n(see Gibson 1966; see also Nanay 2011, 2013). According to Vetter\n(2021), we literally see potentialities or possibilities as part of\nthe content of our perception. In her (forthcoming) she emphasizes\nthat her account is ambitious. In her view, all of our modal\nknowledge is based on knowledge of our own abilities and dispositions,\nas well as the dispositions and affordances of objects around us.\nModal knowledge is, thus, for Vetter, distinctively empirical, in that\nit requires experiencing such dispositions and affordances.\n\nWhile Strohminger and Vetter focus on knowledge of non-actual\npossibilities, Catherine Legg and James Franklin (2017) hold that one\ncan perceive necessities visually through certain kinds of\ndiagrams, such as picture proofs in mathematics. The diagrams\nthemselves provide us with a perceptual path to seeing that certain\nkinds of truths are necessary (see also Legg 2012).\nCritical Questions for Perceptual Theories\n\nThe Is-It-Really-Perception Question: Does sensory\nperceptual experience on its own really give knowledge of what is\npossible or necessary, or does the knowledge use rational intuition\nabout the perceived content as well? If we literally see that\nsomething is possible, what does its possibility look like? What is a\nvisual appearance of being possible?\n\nThe Modal Kind Question: What kind of modality does\none perceive? For example, when I see that I can reach a mug, what\nkind of modality is it that I see? One view is that what I see is\npractical possibility. And if that is so, this raises the\nNavigation question of how one is to epistemically\nnavigate from practical possibility to metaphysical possibility.\nDo we navigate from practical to metaphysical possibility by (tacit)\ninference via the background assumption that whatever is practically\npossible is also metaphysically possible? Or does this background\nassumption inform our perceptual practices to the effect that we\nindeed directly perceive metaphysical possibility?\n",
