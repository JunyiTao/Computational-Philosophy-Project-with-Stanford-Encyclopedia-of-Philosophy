    "main_text": "Epistemology || The Argument from Experience\n9.2 The Argument from Experience\n\nVarious philosophers have defended the evidential value, to one degree\nor another, of some religious and mystical experiences, principally\nwith regard to experiences of God (see Baillie 1939,\nBroad 1953, Davis 1989, Gellman 1997 and 2001a,\nGutting 1982, Swinburne 1991 and 1996, Wainwright 1981,\nYandell 1993). These philosophers have stressed the\n\u201cperceptual\u201d nature of experiences of God. This approach can be\nsummarized as follows:\n\n\n\nExperiences of God have a subject/object structure with a\nphenomenological content allegedly representing the object of the\nexperience. Subjects are also moved to make truth claims based on such\nexperiences. Furthermore, there are mystical procedures for getting\ninto position for a mystical experience of God (see Underhill 1911 [1945,\n90\u201394]), and others can take up a suitable mystical path to try\nto check on the subject\u2019s claims (see Bergson 1977, 210). In all\nthese ways, experiences of God are perceptual in nature. \n\n\nSuch experiences count as at least some evidence in favor of\ntheir own validity. That a person seems to experience some object is\nsome reason to think he or she really does have experiential contact\nwith it. Thus, experiences of God count as at least some evidence\nin favor of their own validity. \n\n\nAgreement between experiences of people in different places, times,\nand traditions enhances the evidence in favor of their validity\n(see Broad 1953). Hence, agreement about experiences of God in\ndiverse circumstances enhances the evidence in their favor. (But see\nSection 9.6.) \n\n\nFurther enhancement of the validity of a mystical experience can come\nfrom appropriate consequences in the life of the person who had the\nexperience, such as increased saintliness (see Wainwright 1981,\n83\u201388). William James proposed a pragmatic\n\u201cfruit\u201d test for determining true mystical doctrines (James\n1958, 368): if a mystical experience produces positive results in\nhow one leads one\u2019s life, then the experience is authentic and\nthe way of life one follows is vindicated, and so the teachings\nleading to the positive life are correct. In short, the\n\u201ctruth\u201d of one\u2019s beliefs are shown by one\u2019s\nlife as a whole. (But what is considered positive fruit in one\nmystical tradition may not be considered so in another.) \n\n\n(1)\u2013(4) yield initial evidence in favor of the validity of\n(some) experiences of God.\n\nKai-Man Kwan has developed this type of argument further by specifying\ntheistic experience, in particular, as a \u201cwell-established type\nof experience.\u201d The tokens of such a type of experience occur to\nmany people and on repeated occasions, have a common ontology, and are\ncommunicable in a coherent conceptual framework. This strengthens an\nargument from experience for theistic experience (Kwan 2011,\n511).\n\nKwan (2011 and 2013) has also significantly expanded the Argument from\nExperience in a way that avoids focusing only on experiential\nepisodes. He argues for what he calls a \u201cholistic\nempiricism\u201d that considers an array of dimensions of human\nexperience: the noetic (consisting of epistemic seemings), the\nqualitative (the feel of what it is like to have the\nexperience), and the volitional (action, choice, deliberation,\nand the like). Kwan argues that when judging the credentials of\nreligious experience we should take into account the following\nexperiences, in addition to narrowly selected religious experiences:\nexperiences of the natural world and of the self, existential\nexperience, interpersonal experience, moral experience, aesthetic\nexperience, and intellectual experience. Kwan argues that the\nintegration, in the appropriate way, of these types of experience\ncoherently and fruitfully constitutes a defeasible justification for\nrelying on the product of religious belief. Kwan argues in this way\nfor theistic belief in particular. A similar argument can be presented\nfor judging narrowly construed mystical experience. The unit of\njustification of believing a proposition when having had a mystical\nexperience would be the entire holistic complex of all of the\nmystic\u2019s experiences. Going beyond, but including, discrete\nmystical episodes, the mystic is able to fashion a cumulative case for\nmystical conclusions.\n\nKwan\u2019s argument avoids the objection based on dissimilarities\nbetween mystical experiences and sense-experience. The unit of\njustification then encompasses far more than the mystical experience\nitself. Kwan\u2019s argument also neutralizes objections based on\nneuroscience against the validity of mystical experiences: belief in\nthe import of mystical experience will seek justification far beyond\nwhat can be possibly identified as a brain state\naccompanying a mystical experience.\n\nWhether any experiences of God are veridical in the end will depend on\nthe strength of the initial evidential case, on other favorable\nevidence, and on the power of counter-considerations against validity.\nDefenders of the Argument from Experience differ over the strength of\nthe initial evidential case and have defended the Argument\nagainst counter-evidence to varying degrees.\n",
