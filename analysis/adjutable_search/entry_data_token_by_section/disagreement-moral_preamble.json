    "main_text": "\n\n\nAppeals to moral disagreement have figured in philosophical\ndiscussions since antiquity, especially regarding questions about the\nnature of morality. An example is provided by Sextus Empiricus, who in\na famous passage concludes (in Richard Bett\u2019s translation) that\n\u201cthere is nothing by nature good or bad\u201d from the\nobservation that \u201cthe same thing is thought bad by one person and\ngood by another\u201d (Against the Ethicists, 14). It is\noften dubious to characterize the thoughts of ancient philosophers by\nusing distinctions and terminologies that have emerged much later.\nStill, it is tempting to take Sextus to offer an argument against the\nmetaethical position known as \u201cmoral realism\u201d and its\ncentral thesis that there are moral truths which are objective in the\nsense that they are independent of human practices and thinking.\n\n\nMoral realism is the target also of many modern appeals to moral\ndisagreement which are often made by philosophers who instead favor\nnihilist, relativist, constructivist, non-cognitivist or expressivist\nviews. However, the phenomenon has been ascribed other dialectical\nroles as well. For example, it has also been invoked in support of\nrealism. Metaethics is furthermore not the only domain in which moral\ndisagreement has received attention. Another is political philosophy.\nAn influential view which is known as \u201cpublic reason\u201d\nentails that a government\u2019s use of coercive power is legitimate\nonly if it can be justified to the citizens on the basis of principles\nthat all could reasonably accept. That view provides a different context in\nwhich facts about moral disagreement are relevant (see Quong 2018 for\nan overview and discussion). Nevertheless, this entry is exclusively devoted\nto its metaethical significance.\n\n\nSome of the topics metaethicists address concern the metaphysics and\nontology of morality. Others concern its epistemology and its semantics\n(and metasemantics). Moral disagreement has been thought relevant to\nall those subfields, and the entry is organized in accordance with the\ndivisions among them. However, one of the points the discussions below\nare meant to illustrate is that the topics are related and that\nthe positions and arguments that have been put forward in one of the\nsubfields might be relevant also to those in another.\n",
