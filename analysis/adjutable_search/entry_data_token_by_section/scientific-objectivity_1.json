Objectivity as Faithfulness to Facts\n\nThe basic idea of this first conception of objectivity is that\nscientific claims are objective in so far as they faithfully describe\nfacts about the world. The philosophical rationale underlying this\nconception of objectivity is the view that there are facts \u201cout\nthere\u201d in the world and that it is the task of scientists to\ndiscover, analyze, and systematize these facts.\n\u201cObjective\u201d then becomes a success word: if a claim is\nobjective, it correctly describes some aspect of the world.\n\nIn this view, science is objective to the degree that it succeeds at\ndiscovering and generalizing facts, abstracting from the perspective\nof the individual scientist. Although few philosophers have fully\nendorsed such a conception of scientific objectivity, the idea figures\nrecurrently in the work of prominent twentieth-century philosophers of\nscience such as Carnap, Hempel, Popper, and Reichenbach.\n",
