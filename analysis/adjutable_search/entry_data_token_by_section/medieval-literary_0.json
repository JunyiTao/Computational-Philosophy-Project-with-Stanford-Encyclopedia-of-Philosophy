    "main_text": "Historical Sources\n1. Historical Sources\n\nMedieval philosophical texts have as their formal sources Greek\ncommentaries, Neoplatonic treatises, dialogues, and allegories, as\nwell as Aristotelian treatises, and the works of Augustine. Before the\nformal development of universities and university curricula that\ndictated the established forms for writing philosophical/theological\ntexts in the 13th century, medieval philosophical texts were written\nin a wide variety of forms. From the 10th to the 12th century, writers\nin the Christian, Jewish, and Arabic traditions composed dialogues,\nallegories, axiomatic works, disputations, and summae, while the 13th\nand 14th centuries in the Latin West were dominated by commentaries,\nprincipally on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences and the works\nof Aristotle, various forms of the disputed question, and the\nsumma.\n\nThe sources and history of these different forms will be discussed\nunder each of the forms considered. After the discussion of the\nprincipal literary forms, the role of authoritative authors and\ninfluence of concerns about censorship and persecution on the form and\nrhetoric of medieval philosophical texts, the historical development\nin these literary forms within the medieval period will be\nconsidered.\n",
