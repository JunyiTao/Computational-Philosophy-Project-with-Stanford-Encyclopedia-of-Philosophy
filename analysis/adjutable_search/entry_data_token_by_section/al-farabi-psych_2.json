The Relevance of the Imaginative Faculty\n\nAccording to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b the imaginative faculty is very\nactive in human cognitive acts. As outlined above, its function is to\nretain sense impressions when they are no longer perceived as external\nstimuli, and also to combine, compose, and even reproduce, those\nimpressions. Following the Aristotelian account,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b thinks that the imaginative faculty is\nintermediate between the sensitive and rational faculties. In fact, in\nthe case of human beings, its function is to provide reason with the\nimpressions attained through the senses, but it also serves the\nrational faculty in other ways, as will be shown.\n\nIn the waking state the imaginative faculty is permanently engaged\nwith the rational, appetitive, and sensible faculties. In such a state\nthe sensible faculty is actively working in interaction with sensibles\nand sense impressions. Likewise, as mentioned, the imaginative faculty\nprovides both the rational and appetitive faculties with these sense\nimpressions. Nevertheless, when in the sleeping state, the sensitive,\nappetitive, and rational faculties cease their activities, and this is\nwhen the imaginative faculty performs a distinctive action of its own.\nGiven that the sensitive faculty is at ease and no longer receiving\nfresh sense impressions, the imaginative faculty turns now to the\nimpressions preserved in itself, and acts upon them by means of\ncomposition and division. Hence, the imaginative faculty has the power\nto preserve and manipulate sense impressions through composition or\ndivision, both in the case of those freshly offered by the senses\nwhile in the waking state and those that have been stored in it\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 210\u2013227).\n\nIn addition to the powers described above, the imaginative faculty has\na distinctive capacity, that is, \u201creproductive imitation\u201d\nor mimesis (muh\u0101k\u0101t). Reproductive imitation refers\nto the capacity displayed by the imaginative faculty to imitate a\nseries of elements by means of the sensibles stored in it. Through\nthese sensibles, the imaginative faculty can imitate impressions that\npertain to the sensitive faculty, intelligibles that pertain to the\nrational faculty, desires that pertain to the appetitive faculty, and\nalso aspects proper to the nutritive faculty and even the temperament\nof the body (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 210\u2013213). This is why\nthe imagination has the capacity to stimulate particular emotions,\nhumors, desires, and temperaments that move the body and put it into\naction (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 216\u2013219).\n\nRegarding the relation between the imaginative and rational faculties,\nsince the imaginative faculty only deals with sensibles, in order to\nrelate to the intelligibles it must imitate them by means of\nsensibles. For this reason, when providing his theory of prophecy and\ndivination, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b argues that while the active\nintellect usually enables the actualization of the potential\nintelligibles in the material intellect, in some special cases the\nactive intellect directly provides intelligibles that are accessible\nto the imaginative faculty in the form of particular sensibles. These\nevents can take place both in the waking and sleeping states, but are\nrather rare while waking and restricted to a few people\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 220\u2013223).\n\nWhen an individual has a very powerful imaginative faculty, to such a\ndegree that it is no longer restricted to the supply of images to the\nother faculties, it is thus free to experience sensibles of extreme\nbeauty and perfection by means of imitation. The highest rank of\nperfection that the imaginative faculty can achieve is precisely when\nan individual attains prophecy or awareness of present or future\nevents, as well as the capacity to see glorious or divine beings. This\ncan be achieved by means of present and future particulars and the\ntranscendent intelligibles of divine beings, both granted by the\nactive intellect. However, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b also expounds a\nseries of inferior ranks below this most perfect attainment of vision,\neach progressively more imperfect than the precedent in terms of\nwhether the vision takes place during waking or sleeping states, and\nwhether the individual has access to particulars or intelligibles.\nAccording to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, the most common kind of vision\nis that of individuals who receive particulars while in the sleeping\nstate.\n\nAlthough al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s conception of the\nimaginative faculty departs from Aristotle\u2019s view, it combines\nsome elements coming from the Hellenistic and the Middle Platonist\ntraditions that, as Walzer (1957: 142\u2013148) points out, may have\nbeen taken from Porphyry and Proclus. The result is a psychological\nexplanation of prophecy and divination. In recent years, scholars\nworking on the Arabic version of Aristotle\u2019s treatise On\nDivination in Sleep (Hansberger 2008: 73\u201374; 2010: 158)\nhave suggested that this work is a relevant source for the\nunderstanding of the Islamic philosophical conception of prophecy,\nincluding that of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b. The Arabic On\nDivination in Sleep is an adulterated version of\nAristotle\u2019s text and provides a different explanation of\nveridical dreams within a Neoplatonic metaphysical framework, where a\nuniversal intellect distributes veridical dreams and some people with\noutstanding psychological capacities are able to receive them and\ninterpret\n them.[4]\n Even though no explicit references are made to On Divination in\nSleep in al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s The Virtuous\nCity, there are noticeable similarities between the two\ntreatises.\n",
