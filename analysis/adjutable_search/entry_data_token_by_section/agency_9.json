    "main_text": "The metaphysics of agency || Deviant causal chains\n3.2 Deviant causal chains\nIn the 1950s and 60s, several philosophers argued that the\nevent-causal framework is incoherent. Their main argument was the so\ncalled \u201clogical connection argument\u201d, which says, very\nroughly, that the relation between mental attitudes and actions\ncannot be causal, because the connection between them is logical,\nconceptual, or in some sense non-contingent (Hampshire 1959; Melden\n1961; Kenny 1963, for instance). It is widely agreed now that this\nattack was unsuccessful (the most influential reply is due to\nDavidson 1963; see also Goldman 1970:\n109\u2013116).[16]\nShortly after that another challenge\nemerged, which turned out to be the most serious and most persistent\nproblem for the standard theory and the event-causal framework: the\nproblem of deviant causal chains.\nIn general, the problem is that it seems always possible that the\nrelevant mental states and events cause the relevant event (a certain\nmovement, for instance) in a deviant way: so that this event is\nclearly not an intentional action or not an action at all. It is\ncommon to distinguish between cases of basic deviance\nand consequential deviance (also called primary and\nsecondary deviance). A murderous nephew intends to kill his uncle in\norder to inherit his fortune. He drives to his uncle\u2019s house\nand on the way he kills a pedestrian by accident. As it turns out,\nthis pedestrian is his uncle. This is a case of consequential\ndeviance (Chisholm 1966). In a standard case of basic deviance\n(Davidson 1973), a climber intends to rid himself of the weight and\ndanger of holding another man on a rope by loosening his grip. This\nintention unnerves him so that it causes him to loosen his hold on\nthe rope. The difference between the cases is best explained in terms\nof the distinction between basic and non-basic\nactions. Very roughly, basic actions are the things that one can do\nwithout doing something else (such as raising one\u2019s hand),\nwhereas the performance of non-basic actions requires that one does\nsomething else (such as giving someone a signal by raising\none\u2019s hand).[17] In the consequential case, the nephew\nhas an intention to perform a non-basic action (to kill his\nuncle). He successfully performs several basic actions, but it is a\nsheer coincidence that he brings about the intended end. The climber,\nin contrast, does not perform any action at all. The mental\nantecedent causes a movement that would have been a basic\naction, had the causal chain not been deviant.\nAny event-causal theory of agency must require that the relevant\nmental attitudes cause the action in the right way. The right way of\ncausation is non-deviant causation. The challenge is to spell out\nwhat non-deviant causation consists in within the event-causal\nframework; without, in particular, any appeal to some unanalyzed\nnotion of agent-causation or control. Davidson (1974) was pessimistic\nabout the prospects for finding an event-causal account of\nnon-deviant causation, and he suggested that the standard theory is\nbest understood as providing only necessary conditions for\nagency. Goldman (1970) suggested that giving an account of\nnon-deviant causation is an empirical rather than a philosophical\ntask. Since then, however, most proponents of the event-causal\napproach have acknowledged that the problem of deviant causal chains\nis a serious philosophical problem, and various solutions have been\nproposed (see Peacocke 1979; Brand 1984; Bishop 1989; Mele 2003;\nSchlosser 2007, 2011; Wu 2016).[18]\n",
