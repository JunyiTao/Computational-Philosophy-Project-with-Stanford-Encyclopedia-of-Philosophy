    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nRichard McKay Rorty was born on October 4th, 1931, in New York City.\nHe grew up, as he recounts in Achieving Our Country (1998,\nhereafter AOC), \u201con the anti-communist reformist Left in\nmid-century\u201d (AOC, 59), within a circle combining anti-Stalinism\nwith leftist social activism. \u201cIn that circle,\u201d Rorty\ntells us, \u201cAmerican patriotism, redistributionist economics,\nanticommunism, and Deweyan pragmatism went together easily and\nnaturally\u201d (AOC, 61). In 1946, Rorty went to the University of\nChicago, to a philosophy department which at that time included\nRudolph Carnap, Charles Hartshorne, and Richard McKeon, all of whom\nwere Rorty\u2019s teachers. After receiving his BA in 1949, Rorty\nstayed on at Chicago to complete an M.A. (1952) with a thesis on\nWhitehead supervised by Hartshorne. From 1952 to 1956 Rorty was at\nYale, where he wrote a dissertation entitled \u201cThe Concept of\nPotentiality.\u201d His supervisor was Paul Weiss. After the\ncompletion of his Ph.D., followed by two years in the army, Rorty\nreceived his first academic appointment, at Wellesley College. In\n1961, after three years at Wellesley, Rorty moved to Princeton\nUniversity where he stayed until he went to the University of\nVirginia, in 1982, as Kenan Professor of the Humanities. Rorty left\nthe University of Virginia in 1998, accepting an appointment in the\nDepartment of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. In the\ncourse of his career, Rorty received several academic awards and\nhonours, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (1973\u201374) and a\nMacArthur Fellowship (1981\u20131986). He held a number of\nprestigious lectureships, giving, among others, the Northcliffe\nLectures at University College, London (1986), the Clark Lectures at\nTrinity College, Cambridge (1987), and the Massey Lectures at Harvard\n(1997). Rorty died on June 8th, 2007.\n",
