    "main_text": "Anglo-American Psychoanalytic Feminism\n6. Conclusion\n\nPsychoanalysis presents a critical and diagnostic project, not\nnecessarily a normative or liberatory one. In developing a theory of\nthe drives and the non-rational forces that move and impel us, the\nidea that we are opaque rather than transparent to ourselves,\nincapable of complete self-knowledge or self-mastery, psychoanalytic\ntheory also challenges the rationalist, humanist ego and proposes that\nour ethical characters and political communities are not perfectable,\nexposing the precariousness of both psychic and political identity.\nThe unconscious cannot be assumed to be inherently either a\ntransgressive or a conservative force, but an unreliable one,\npromoting revolt or rebellion sometimes, intransigence and rigid\nborder preservation at other times.\n\nAlthough they are in often uneasy alliance, the psychoanalytic account\nof the unconscious provides feminist theory with resources for both\npolitical and ontological inquiry. Ontologically, psychoanalysis\noffers a distinctively psychical understanding of sexual difference,\nhow we come to inhabit our bodies and our identities, and misinhabit\nthem, an analysis reducible to neither social nor biological\ncategories. Politically, psychoanalysis offers a depiction of the\nforces that impel us to organize, disorganize, and reorganize the\nbonds that hold us together. By offering insight into the formation of\nsubjectivity and the animating fantasies of social life,\npsychoanalysis thus also facilitates feminist analysis of the obdurate\nelements of patriarchal social relations, including the symbolic bonds\nand internal forces that undergird identity and attach sexed subjects\nto relations of dominance and subordination. Psychoanalytic feminist\nattention to the core constituents of civilization, to the nuclei of\nsexual difference and communal affiliation, helps explain the\nperpetuation of masculine power and enables feminist theorists to\narticulate possible correctives, challenges, routes of amelioration,\nor ethical interruptions that go to the roots of political life and to\nits beyond and do not simply operate on the given social terrain.\n",
