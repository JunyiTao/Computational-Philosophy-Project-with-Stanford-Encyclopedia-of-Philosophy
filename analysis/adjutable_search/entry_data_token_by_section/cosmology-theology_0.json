    "main_text": "Creation and the big bang\n2. Creation and the big bang\n\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity shows that the structure\nof spacetime is itself a dynamical variable, subject to causal\ninfluence by the material constituents of the universe. Indeed,\nEinstein immediately saw the potential to apply general relativity to\nlarge-scale cosmological questions. The first cosmological model of\nEinstein (1917) described a static universe, i.e. one whose spatial\ngeometry is constant over time. However, Einstein\u2019s static\nuniverse was empirically inadequate: it could not account for the\nredshift data gathered by Edwin Hubble and others in the 1920s. The\nredshift data indicated that distant stars are moving away from us,\nand moving faster in direct proportion to their distance. Thus, the\ndata indicated an expanding universe.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, a number of cosmological models of general\nrelativity were proposed that predict the expansion of the universe.\nThe most accurate account of the data is given by the family of\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. The key characteristic of\nthese models is that space is homogeneous, and hence\nisotropic (i.e. looks the same in all directions). From the\nhomogeneity assumption, it follows that the entire 4-dimensional\nspacetime divides neatly into a stack of 3-dimensional\n\u201cspaces\u201d each of which has constant curvature. The three\npossibilities for this curvature correspond to the three classical\ngeometries: Euclidean (flat), spherical (positive), or hyperbolic\n(negative). In a given FRW spacetime, the geometry of space at one\ntime is related to the geometry at any other time by means of a scale\nfactor S(t). Indeed, pick a reference time T,\nsuch as 2021, pick two reference galaxies, and let d(T)\nbe the distance between these galaxies at time T. Then the\ndistance between the two galaxies at any other time t is given\nby d(t)=S(t)d(T), where we\nset S(T)=1. This number S(t) is called the\nscale factor, and its behavior encodes the dynamics of a FRW\nuniverse.\n\nIn those FRW spacetimes that can reasonably be thought to model our\ncosmos (e.g., those with massive objects), the time parameter t\nhas an absolute lower bound t0. In particular, as\nt decreases towards t0, the scale parameter\nS(t) goes to zero. What happens when t reaches\nt0? In short, these models cannot say what happens,\nbecause there are no points of spacetime with time coordinate\nt0. That is, t0 is an ideal point\nthat is never reached: the universe exists at all times after\nt0, but not before or at time t0.\nA spacetime model with this feature is called singular, and\nthe ideal point that is never reached is called a\nsingularity. In other words, the big bang is a singularity in\na FRW spacetime.\n\nThe FRW spacetimes are extremely accurate descriptions of the large\nscale structure of our universe. Since these models describe a\nuniverse with a finite lifetime, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat the universe has not always existed.\n\nBut many physicists and philosophers hesitate to draw this conclusion.\nIn fact, the standard view in the 1950s and early 1960s was that the\nsingularities of the FRW models were consequences of false idealizing\nassumptions, namely assumptions of perfect isotropy and homogeneity.\nBut this escape route from singularities was definitely closed when\nRobert Geroch, Stephen Hawking, and Roger Penrose proved the\n\u201csingularity theorems,\u201d according to which almost\nall spacetimes are singular, and in particular, almost all\ncosmological models describe a finitely old universe.\n\nA number of theists take the past-singular nature of cosmological\nmodels as confirmation of the claim that God created the universe\nex nihilo. The list of advocates of this \u201cbig bang\ntheology\u201d includes Pope Pius XII, Francis Collins (director, US\nNational Institutes of Health), and apologists William Lane Craig and\nHugh Ross. And indeed, big bang cosmology does provide prima\nfacie support for theism. After all, big bang cosmology says that\nthe universe has a finite age, and (traditional) theism says that God\ncreated the universe out of nothing. Does big bang cosmology not\nconfirm traditional theism? We give several reasons to be cautious\nabout such claims.\n\nAdvocates of big bang theology are most interested in the claim that\nthe universe is finitely old. Thus, the chain of inferential support\nshould run as follows:\n\nBig Bang Model \u2192 supports \u2192 Universe Finitely Old\n\u2192 supports \u2192 Theism\n\n\nBefore discussing the first supposed inferential relation, we note\nthat not all theists are committed to the claim that the universe is\nfinitely old. For example, Aquinas claims (in several places,\nincluding the Summa Theologica) that Reason cannot\ndemonstrate the finitude of the universe. But Aquinas also thinks that\nReason can demonstrate the existence of God; therefore Aquinas does\nnot think that the very concept of God as creator implies that the\nuniverse is finitely old. (Contrary to some contemporary theologians,\nAquinas claims that a Christian theist should believe that\nthe universe is finitely old. For Aquinas, the finite age of the\nuniverse is a revealed doctrine, like the divinity of Christ.)\n\nContemporary theologians Arthur Peacocke and Ian Barbour also claim\nthat the doctrine of the \u201ccreation\u201d of the universe is\nbest interpreted as one of the universe\u2019s timeless dependence on\nGod, and that such dependence does not demand a temporal creation\nevent. This is also the view of William Stoeger (2010), a Jesuit\npriest and cosmologist, who argues that scientific cosmology can\npurify theology but never be in conflict with what theology\nlegitimately asserts. For the remainder of this article, we will not\ndiscuss further the question of whether theism requires, or strongly\nsupports, the claim that the universe is finitely old. (Arguments for\nthis claim are assessed in (Copan & Craig 2004).) For now we focus\non versions of theism that are committed\u2014in a perhaps naive\nway\u2014to creation ex nihilo. Even on this understanding\nof theism, there are still reasons to exercise caution in seeing the\nbig bang as confirming the prediction that God created the\nuniverse.\n",
