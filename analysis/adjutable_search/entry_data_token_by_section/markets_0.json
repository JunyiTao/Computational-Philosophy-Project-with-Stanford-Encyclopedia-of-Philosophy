    "main_text": "Conceptual delineations\n1. Conceptual delineations\n\nThe term \u201cmarket\u201d with its cognates in other European\nlanguages (march\u00e9, Markt, mercado, etc.) stems from the Latin\nroot \u201cmerx\u201d. It means \u201cwares\u201d or\n\u201cmerchandise\u201d. To understand better what markets are, it\nis important to distinguish the concept of markets from other, related\nconcepts.\n\nThe concept of \u201cexchange\u201d is at the core of the concept of\nmarkets. In markets, exchanges of goods and services take place for\nreasons of self-interest, in contrast to, for example, the exchange of\ngifts with the aim of building relationships (on gift exchange see\ne.g., Maus 1923\u201324). Most markets use money as a medium of\nexchange. Often, individuals act as \u201cprice takers\u201d, i.e.,\nthey take prices as given and choose how much to buy or sell. But\nthere are also markets where exchanges take place in the form of\nbarter or in different forms of auctions. The concept of\n\u201cmarkets\u201d, however, is wider than the concept of exchange\nbecause it includes the structural macro-effects that result from a\nlarge number of exchanges, for example changes in the overall price\nlevel.\n\n\u201cCompetition\u201d is a feature of markets, but is also used in\ndifferent senses, e.g., with regard to institutional competition or\nevolutionary competition. In markets, competition results from the\nfact that agents seek to find the best deal, thus creating competition\namong the participants on the other side of the market, supply or\ndemand respectively. Markets are called \u201ccompetitive\u201d when\nthey have certain structural features that include a large number of\nbuyers and sellers, comparable goods, and the absence of informational\nasymmetries. In what follows, the focus is on competitive markets,\nleaving aside the specific problems (in particular unequal market\npower) of non-competitive markets such as monopolies or cartels. It\nshould be noted, however, that even in seemingly competitive markets\nthere are often \u201cpockets\u201d of unequal market power, e.g.,\nwhen a company is the only employer in a certain region or when a bank\npossesses more information than its customers. To the degree to which\nsuch deviations from the model of a competitive market are unavoidable\n\u2013 for example because network effects in the digital realm lead\nto highly concentrated markets \u2013 they need to be taken into\naccount in normative evaluations of these markets.\n\nThe term \u201ceconomy\u201d describes the productive and\ndistributive activities of a region or country, which includes\nmarkets, but also the legal framework within which they take place, as\nwell as the organizations within markets, such as households and\ncorporations (on the latter see recently Ciepley 2013 and Anderson\n2017). The latter\u2019s internal structure is typically hierarchical\nand bureaucratic and thus quite different from the structure of\n markets.[1]\n In many countries, the \u201ceconomy\u201d also includes a state\nsector as well as mixed forms, such as private-public partnerships. It\ncan also include other forms of redistribution such as charities or\n\u201cblack markets\u201d. Polanyi has provided a classic\ncategorization of allocation mechanisms: he distinguishes between\nreciprocity (based on symmetrical relations), redistribution (based on\ncentricity: a central authority collects the goods and hands them out\nto individuals), autarky (production for one\u2019s own use) and\nmarkets (1944, ch. 4). This shows that markets are only one form in\nwhich goods and services can be allocated in a society. Insofar as\nother structures \u2013 e.g., hierarchical structures within\ncorporations \u2013 continue to play a role in economic systems, it\nis misleading to conceptualize them as pure \u201cmarket\neconomies.\u201d\n\nThe concept of \u201ccapitalism\u201d includes a reference to\nmarkets, but as a socio-economic system, it is broader; its defining\nfeature is the private ownership of capital (see e.g., Scott 2011).\nThis typically leads to pressures to find profitable investment\nopportunities and to asymmetries between owners and non-owners of\ncapital. Markets are a core element of capitalism, but in principle\nthey can also exist in societies in which the ownership of capital is\norganized differently (see e.g., Carens 1981 for a proposal that\nbuilds on \u201cmoral incentives\u201d; for the debate about\n\u201cmarket socialism\u201d in general see e.g., Bardhan/Roemer\n1993). Many proposals for reforming current forms of capitalism, for\nexample the Rawlsian idea of a \u201cproperty owning democracy\u201d\n(see e.g., O\u2019Neill/Williamson 2012), do not reject markets, but\nrather argue for a more equal distribution of productive assets.\n\nA vague, but nonetheless helpful distinction is drawn by Polanyi\nbetween \u201cmarket economies\u201d and \u201cmarket\nsocieties\u201d. The latter are societies where \u201cinstead of the\neconomy being embedded in social relations, social relations are\nembedded in the economy\u201d (Polanyi 1944, 57, see also Cunningham\n2005). Many arguments about the value of markets have to do with their\nimpact on the character of a society as a whole and with the questions\nof where, when, and how one should limit the influence of markets. In\nPolanyi\u2019s terms, this is the question of whether a \u201cmarket\neconomy\u201d can and should remain a \u201cmarket economy\u201d,\nor whether it does or should lead to a \u201cmarket\nsociety\u201d.\n",
