    "main_text": "Influence || Literary Afterlife\n5.1 Literary Afterlife\n\nPufendorf\u2019s (Latin) style is clear and careful, though also\nsophisticated and colorful. For he not only mastered the art of\nexample but was also an aggressive, imaginative, and sometimes crass\npolemicist when attacked \u2013 especially when cornered, when the\nstakes were high, or when he deemed his opponents to be bellicose,\nlazy, or intellectually dishonest. This alone assured that he was\neagerly and widely read. Many of his works \u2013 including Monz.\n(1667), DJN (1672), DO (1673), Einl. (1682) \u2013 were published\nrepeatedly and translated into many European languages, both during\nhis lifetime and throughout most of the following century (Othmer\n1970, Luig 1972, Denzer 1972, Laurent 1982, Seidler 2013), when they\nbecame staples of university education. Of particular note in this\nextensive publication history were the influential French translations\nby Jean Barbeyrac, whose long notes to DJN and DO (including their\nLockean leanings) were partially assumed into the standard English\ntranslations of these works (if not immediately then in later\neditions), specifically those by Basil Kennet (DJN 1729) and Andrew\nTooke (DO 1735). In fact there was considerable interest in Pufendorf\nin England (starting with Tyrrell and Locke \u2013 see Tyrrell 1681,\nesp. pp. 236\u201359, and Thompson 1987), which also saw translations\nof various other works, including The Present State of\nGermany (Monz 1690, 1696), The History of Popedom (Einl.\n[1691]), the Introduction (Einl. 1695), Of the Nature and\nQualification of Religion, in Reference to Civil Society (Habitu\n1698), and The Divine Feudal Law (Feciale 1703). These and\nother translations are currently being reissued by Liberty Fund, Inc.\nas part of its Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics series,\nand are readily available in its Online Library of Liberty.\n(See Other Internet Resources below.) Pufendorf\u2019s three main\nnatural law works (including the early EJU) were also reprinted and\nretranslated in the early twentieth century as part of the Carnegie\nEndowment\u2019s Classics of International Law series, and\nare still occasionally reissued in this form (EJU 1995a, 1995b [2009];\nDJN 1995c, 1995d; DO 1995g, 1995h). However, there was never a\ncollective edition of Pufendorf\u2019s works in any language, before the ongoing Gesammelte Werke (GW) issued by the Akademie Verlag (Walter de Gruyter). This edition includes as Vol. 1 (BW 1996) the extant correspondence which, though limited in comparison to other early moderns like Leibniz, is nonetheless very useful, especially in conjunction with the polemical\nessays in Eris Scandica (ES 2002b), which add biographical\nand literary details. The shorter works collected by D\u00f6ring (KVS 1995e) are not included in GW, which does or will, however, contain Feciale\n(2004), Habitu (2016), DAS (1675b), and Monz.(1667). Since the long\nnational histories are now easily obtainable in facsimile form or as\nscans (see ZVDD and Gallica, in Other Internet Resources below), all\nof Pufendorf\u2019s known writings will soon be readily available to\nscholars in some contemporary form.\n",
