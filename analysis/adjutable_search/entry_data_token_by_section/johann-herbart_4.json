    "main_text": "Psychology || Statics of spirit\n3.3 Statics of spirit\nAs we have seen, on Herbart\u2019s view, representations are the\nperturbations, i.e., the individual or atomic representings that\npresent as pictures the real objects that, through the senses,\ndisturb the simple, continuous representing that is consciousness\n(PsW: 135).  Any representation, taken in isolation,\nis fully determined by the real object it presents to\nconsciousness. Thus, since \u201crepresentation\u201d just means\nthe generation and maintenance of the presented picture, the concept\nof representation, as such, contains neither the notion of striving,\nnor of any activity directed beyond itself (PsW: 134\u20135). But\nthis Parmenidean state of a single atomic presentation, a\n\u201cwell-rounded sphere\u201d completely bathed in the light of\nawareness, never obtains in reality. Instead, various streams of new\nrepresentations constantly come flowing into consciousness, and of\nthese representations, many oppose each other. We might picture these\natoms as elastic[18]\n balls streaming into the narrow\nbeam[19] of\nawareness, jostling and crowding those already bobbing on the surface\nof consciousness. Depending on the strength and vivacity of these\nballs, some will remain floating, but most will quickly be pressed\ndown, to some extent, through the surface and out of the light, which\nphenomenon was called \u201cinhibition\u201d, above.\nThis picture, fanciful though it may be, can nonetheless help us\nget a grip on the idea of the \u201cinhibition-sum\u201d\n(Hemmungssumme), which plays a key role in Herbart\u2019s\npsycho-statics, but which he and his commentators treat in a very\nabstract, mathematical way. The idea is simply this: should two\nrepresentations (to take the simplest case) oppose each other, then\nthis opposition immediately causes them to squeeze and jostle each\nother, for they cannot both fully express themselves or be completely\npresent to consciousness at the same time, as introspection readily\nconfirms. Rather, they crowd (dr\u00e4ngen) each other;\nindeed, each attempts to suppress or even completely crowd\nout (verdr\u00e4ngen) the other. As our picture suggests,\nthis opposing and crowding is not a state but a movement, a\n\u201cConflict\u201d or struggle to dominate, which takes\ntime to reach a resolution (LPs, SW IV: 371 [\u00a7127]). The laws\ngoverning this movement are treated by mechanics (see following\nsection), whereas statics deals with the end-state, i.e., the\nequilibrium that temporarily resolves the struggle, which Herbart\nterms the \u201cstatic point\u201d (der statische Punct)\n(cf. LPs, SW IV: 371 [\u00a7128]). This equilibrium is reached when\neach representation expresses itself to the greatest degree possible,\ngiven the countervailing pressure of the other. The two elastic balls\nreach a state, in other words, where each presses or inhibits the\nother, but neither can increase that pressure further. So they come\nto rest in a state of mutual inhibition, in which neither\n\u201cshines\u201d as brightly as it would if unimpeded by the\nother.[20]\nWhat Herbart calls the \u201cinhibition-sum\u201d, then, is the\ntotal of the opposed inhibitory forces, i.e., the total inhibiting\nexerted by the opposed representations upon each other, in a\nstate of resting equilibrium. With this preliminary description\nin hand, let us turn to Herbart\u2019s mathematical\npresentation.\n3.3.1 \u201cInhibition sum\u201d and \u201cinhibition ratio\u201d\nAll psycho-static investigations are ultimately based on two\ndeterminations of psychic magnitude: (1) the\n\u201cinhibition-sum\u201d (Summe der Hemmung\nor Hemmungssumme); (2) the \u201cinhibition relation\u201d,\nor better, \u201cinhibition-ratio\u201d\n(Hemmungs-Verh\u00e4ltni\u00df).\n3.3.1.1 \u201cInhibition sum\u201d\nIn 3.3, I called the inhibition-sum the total of\nopposed inhibitory forces in the system of two (or more) opposed\nrepresentations; Herbart himself likens it to\n\nthe load [Last], generated by the\noppositions among the representations, that is to be distributed\n[across the opposed representations]. (LPs: 371; cf. SW V:\n284)\nHe uses a thought-experiment to derive the mathematical expression\nof the basic laws of representational \u201cmotion\u201d, that is,\nthe laws according to which our mental representations interact with\neach other. Under normal conditions, representations are of different\nstrengths, and so oppose each other with differential intensity,\nmaking a clear statement of their underlying laws difficult. Herbart\ntherefore first considers an ideal case, the extreme at which two\nrepresentations are \u201cfully opposed\u201d one to another, that\nis, one is completely inhibited, so that the other may remain\nunconstrained (PsW: 139). Under such circumstances,\n\nthe most that can occur is the complete\n\u201csinking\u201d of the former, i.e., a complete extinction of\nits represented content [ihres Vorgestellten] through the\ntransformation of all its activity into a mere striving against its\nopposed [representation]. (PsW: 139; SW V: 281)\n\n In other words, the former representation would\nbe completely suppressed (verdr\u00e4ngt) (SW V: 281).\nHerbart next posits a second\nidealized[21]\ncase, in which the opposition is only partial, not\n\u201cfull\u201d, as above. In this case, he says, one\nrepresentation could remain fully uninhibited even if the other were\ninhibited only to a certain degree (PsW: 139,\nff.)[22] He\nnow asks: Given representations a and b, by how\nmuch would each of the two completely opposed representations be\ninhibited? The inhibition of each individual\nrepresentation may be found only if we first know the\n\u201cinhibition sum\u201d\n(S).[23]\n\nThe sum of the inhibition [i.e., the total of the\ninhibitive force of both representations] is the quantum of the\nrepresenting [des Vorstellens] that must be\ninhibited by the mutually opposing representations added\ntogether. (PsW: 140; SW V: 282)\n\n Put another way, the inhibition sum S\nequals the inhibition of a (i.e., \\(I_a\\)) plus the inhibition of b\n(i.e., \\(I_b\\)), where both \\(I_a\\) and \\(I_b\\) are taken to be as small as\npossible.[24]\n(We should assume a minimal inhibition here since the natural state of\nrepresentations is that of full liberty or radiance, which they always\nstrive to reach as nearly as possible [SW V: 283].) Let us now return\nto the case in which representations, a and b are\nfully opposed. In this case, Herbart writes, \u201ceither a, or\nb must be the inhibition sum\u201d (SW V:\n282). If a is the stronger, then it will be b that\nis fully inhibited and dimmed. What is the minimal necessary magnitude\nof the inhibitory force that a exercises upon b?\nExactly b, since beyond this amount there would be no cause\nfor a to exert a dimming effect.\nIt turns out, however, that in either of the two cases (i.e., the\ncase of full inhibition and the case of partial inhibition), the\nweaker representation turns out not to be totally inhibited,\nsince a part of S must also fall onto the other\nrepresentation (SW V: 282; cf. SW IV: 371, \u00a7130). Why? Because,\nafter all, S is conceived as\n\nin effect the load distributed over the different\nrepresentations that must bear it, viz., all of the antagonistically\nstriving [representations]. (SW V: 282)\n \n Hence, since a portion of S is borne\nby the countervailing representation, the weaker representation can\n(and must) remain uninhibited by just that amount.  If we presuppose\nthe total opposition of representations, then we can extend the above\ndetermination from two to any number of representations, so\nthat a would be opposed by \\(b, c, d, \\ldots n\\). S\nwould then not be smaller than \\((b + c + d + \\ldots + n)\\), but also\nnot larger.\n\nFor if all those [representations] were\ncompletely suppressed, then the strongest [i.e., a] would\nremain completely uninhibited. (SW V: 284)\n3.3.1.2 \u201cInhibition ratio\u201d\nHerbart next considers the proportion in which the inhibition sum\nis spread out over the various, mutually antagonistic representations;\nthis proportion is what he calls the \u201cinhibition-ratio\u201d\n(SW V: 285, ff. [\u00a743]). The calculation of the inhibition ratio\nmay not consider an individual representation as \u201can originally\naggressive force [angreifende Kraft], but only as a resisting\nforce [widerstehende Kraft]\u201d, since, as we saw above,\nrepresentations can on Herbart\u2019s view only be considered to be\nforce-like insofar as they resist one another, not \u201cin\nthemselves\u201d (SW V: 285). Nonetheless, a representation will\nbetter resist countervailing forces and assert itself against other\nrepresentations, \u201cthe more vivacious\n[st\u00e4rker]\u201d it is (SW V: 285). Hence, he argues,\nthe share of the load, S, that a representation must bear is\ninversely proportional to its vivacity: \\(1/i\\), where\n\u201c\\(i\\)\u201d signifies vivacity (SW V: 285\u20136; SW IV:\n371).[25]\nEarlier, we hypothesized a and b to stand in full\nopposition, where \\(a \\gt b\\) (SW V: 288, ff.). Hence \\(S = b\\),\nand S distributes itself over representations a\nand b. Let the part of S borne by a be\ncalled \u201c\\(\\alpha\\)\u201d, and the part borne by b,\n\u201c\\(\\beta\\)\u201d.[26]\n Because \\(b = S\\), it follows that \\(\\alpha\\) + \\(\\beta\\) =\nb. Since the inhibition sum S must for each representation\nstand in inverse proportion to its strength, it follows that \\(\\alpha\\) : \\(\\beta\\)\n:: b : a (Weiss 1928: 77). These equations allow us to calculate the\nportions of S that are distributed to\nrepresentations a and b individually.\n\n\\[\n\\mbox{For \\(a\\), the portion }= \\alpha = \\frac{b^2}{a+b}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mbox{For \\(b\\), the portion }= \\beta = \\frac{ab}{a+b}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) represent the relative dimming of each\nrepresentation (Weiss 1928: 77).\nWhen we subtract the calculated portion of the inhibition sum from\neach original representation a and b, then the\nremainders \u201c\\(R_a\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(R_b\\)\u201d[27]\n designate\n\nthe degrees of the remaining vivacity of\nthe representations, after the inhibition has caused the previously\ncalculated portion of actual representing to be canceled out\n[aufgehoben] and transformed into a mere striving. (SW V:\n288)\n\n Accordingly, what remains of the original\nvivacity following inhibition of a and b,\nrespectively, can be expressed as follows (Weiss 1928: 78):\n\n\\[\nR_{a} = a - \\frac{b^2}{a+b}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nR_{b} = b - \\frac{ab}{a+b}\n\\]\n\nNow if the same conditions obtain for three\nrepresentations, a, b, and c,\nwhere a is the strongest and c the weakest\nrepresentation, then the inhibition sum \\(S = b + c\\) (SW V: 288). As\nin the case of two representations above, we can calculate the\nremaining degrees of clarity (Klarheitsgrade) after\ninhibition (SW V: 288\u20139):\n\n\\[\nR_a = a - \\frac{(bc) \\cdot (b+c)}{bc + ac + ab}\n\\]\n\\[\nR_b = b - \\frac{(ac) \\cdot (b+c)}{bc + ac + ab}\n\\]\n\\[\nR_c = c - \\frac{(ab) \\cdot (b+c)}{bc + ac + ab}\n\\]\n\n3.3.2 Limen or \u201cthreshold of consciousness\u201d\nHerbart now calculates the remainders \\(R\\) for different values\nfor a and b, and for a, b,\nand c, showing that when only two\nrepresentations, a and b, conflict, it is\nimpossible for \\(R_b \\le 0\\), i.e., for it to disappear completely\nfrom awareness (SW V: 289\u201390).  However, according to\nHerbart\u2019s calculations, when three or more representations are\nin play, such that \\(a \\gt b \\gt c\\), it is possible for \\(R_c\\)\n\u2026 \\(\\le 0\\) (SW V:\n289\u201391).[28]\n This result, while perhaps obscure in its\nderivation, is the basis of Herbart\u2019s discovery of the concept\nof the limen or \u201cthreshold\u201d of consciousness:\nfor if, in the opposition of representations a, b,\nand c, the inhibition sum S is distributed in such a\nway that the \u201cremainder\u201d of c\u2019s vivacity\nis \\(\\le 0\\), then this just means that a and b\nhave completely dimmed or crowded out c from conscious\nawareness (cf. SW IV: 371, \u00a7130).\nStill, he warns that we cannot attach any significance to a\n\u201cnegative representing\u201d, since the most that can befall a\nrepresentation is total conversion into mere striving-to-represent,\ni.e., \u201cthat the remainder of actual representing \\(=\n0\\)\u201d.[29]\n Now if we let \\(R_c = 0\\), then,\nsubstituting into the above mentioned equation (cf. SW V: 291),\n\n\\[\n0 = c - \\frac{(ab) \\cdot (b+c)}{bc + ac + ab}\n\\]\n\\[\nc = b \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b+a}}\n\\]\n\nThis formula\u2014the Schwellenformel\u2014expresses what Herbart calls the \u201cstatic threshold\n[statische\nSchwelle]\u201d,[30]\n at which representation c is\ncompletely eclipsed from consciousness by a and b\n(SW V: 293). Hence any further determination of c would be\nirrelevant for calculating the S for a\nand b:\n\nthus, the condition of consciousness, insofar as\nit may be statically determined, in no wise depends upon c\n\u2026 not to mention upon even weaker representations,\nwhich might be present in an infinite number without in the least\nbeing noticed in consciousness, so long as it was and remained in a\nstate of equilibrium of all the representations. (SW V:\n292)\nHerbart immediately applies his discovery of the limen and\nthe possibility of a representation\u2019s suppression beneath it. On\nthe one hand, we notice, he says, that the mind is at any given moment\npreoccupied with a tiny fraction of the total number of cognitions,\nthoughts, or desires that might appear in our consciousness,\ngiven an appropriate stimulus (SW V: 292). This knowledge,\n\nabsent, yet not annihilated, but rather remaining\n in our possession: in what condition is it within us? How does it\n happen that, although it is present, it nonetheless does not\n contribute to the determination of our state of mind until we recall\n it? What can prevent\u2014sometimes for a long time\u2014our most\n vivid convictions, best resolutions, and most refined feelings, from\n being effectual? What can imbue them with the unfortunate inertia by\n which they abandon us to vain\n regret? (SW V: 292)\n The answer is simply: \u201cOther\nthoughts have occupied us too vividly!\u201d and therefore left\nthat \u201cknowledge\u201d hovering beneath the limen. This\nsimple solution, Herbart argues, in one stroke obviates the need for\n\u201cfalse doctrines of transcendental freedom or of radical\nevil\u201d (SW V: 292).\nTo sum up: One representation cannot so crowd out a second, since\nthe remainder of \\(b\\), (i.e., \\([R_b]\\)), can never \\(= 0\\). On the other hand, two\nrepresentations suffice to crowd out a third completely out of\nconsciousness, making it incapable of affecting the state of mind\n(Gem\u00fcthszustand); and this is all the more the case for\nfurther representations with a weaker vivacity than c (SW V:\n292). The limen is determined as a limit\n(\u201cGr\u00e4nze\u201d) below which a representation is\nfully inhibited, but crossing which, it achieves a \u201cdegree of actual\nrepresenting\u201d (SW V: 292). The notion of a degree of\nrepresenting allows Herbart to speak of representations\n\u201crising\u201d and \u201csinking\u201d, and of representations\nlying more or less deeply beneath the limen (SW V:\n293). \u201cConsciousness\u201d, then, just is \u201cthe\ntotality of coincident representing\u201d, and the representations at\nplay in the arena of awareness make out the \u201cstate of\nmind\u201d (SW V: 294; cf. SW IV: 372, \u00a7130). Thus Herbart\nconcludes that the psyche\u2019s apparent property of being only able\nto activate a very small number of representations\nsimultaneously is no property at all. Rather, it is the\nnecessary consequence of the oppositions among our representations\nthemselves, and thus dependent on their native vivacity\n(cf. Boudewijnse, et al. 1999: 178\u20139).\n3.3.3 Fusions and complications\n\n\nThe soul\u2019s unity that we encountered in 3.2 functioned as the\nmetaphysical principle of the inhibition of opposed representations in\n3.3.1\u20132. Now, again, unity is the principle by which the\nunification of certain representations might be explained (cf. SW V:\n307). We must keep in mind that our sensations\n(Sinnesempfindungen) form various continua, \u201csense\ndimensions\u201d (Boudewijnse, et al. 1999: 179), or\n\u201cmodalities\u201d (Boring 1950: 258), e.g., of color or taste\nand smell (PsW: 171; SW V: 307, f.). Within one and the same\ncontinuum, individual representations are opposed to each other, while\nrepresentations from generically different continua are not (SW V:\n307).[31] Thus\nrepresentations lying on one continuum will mutually dim each other to\na certain degree (SW V: 308). So, whereas a number of colors, like\n\u201cwhite, red, black, blue\u201d, will inhibit and dim each\nother, none of them can oppose and inhibit a taste representation (the\nexample is at Weiss 1928: 80; cf. SW V: 312, f). Therefore, as\nrepresentations may belong to the same or different continua, there\nmust be, respectively, two different genera of representational\nunification (SW V: 308).\n3.3.3.1 Fusions\nIn the former case, in which representations are of the same type,\nthey will inhibit each other according to the degree of their\ndifference and only join together so far as inhibition permits it (SW\nV: 308).[32]\nTheir strength and opposition will determine \u201cthe law governing\nthe precise nature of their unification\u201d, which Herbart calls\nthe \u201cfusion\u201d (Verschmelzung) of representations\n(SW V: 308\u20139).[33]  \nExamples might include blue and red fusing into\nthe representation, \u201cpurple\u201d (Boring 1950: 258). Two\ngenerically similar, and therefore opposed, representations will\nstrive to fuse with one another, on account of the unity of the\npsyche. When they melt into one another as far as their mutual\nopposition permits, they reach what Herbart calls the \u201cfusion\npoint [Verschmelzungspunkt]\u201d (Weiss 1928: 82).\n3.3.3.2 Complications\nTake two representations belonging to two distinct types, e.g., a color,\n\\(a\\), and a sound, \\(\\alpha\\) (SW V: 308). Now, on the one hand, no\ninhibition is possible across continua, i.e., so \\(a\\) will not dim\n\\(\\alpha\\). On the other hand, ex hypothesi, there is no\nsecond representation within each respective continuum to\noppose and inhibit either of the two representations (cf.  Felsch\n1902: 5; Weiss 1928: 82). For these two reasons, they can\nunite completely, and are for purposes of calculation\ntreated as a single force or single act, \\(A\\) (SW V: 309; cf. Felsch\n1902: 5).[34]\nSuch unifications are \u201ccomplete complications\n[Komplikationen]\u201d, or \u201cfoldings-together\u201d\n(SW V: 308).[35]\n\nNow imagine that the two heterogeneous representations \\(a\\) and\n\\(\\alpha\\) are joined by representations belonging, respectively, to\nthe same types as those already present, e.g., color-representations,\n\\(b\\) and \\(c\\), and sound representations, \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\)\n(SW V: 308). Here \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)\u2019s appearance in the same\ncolor continuum as \\(a\\) results in the mutual inhibition of \\(a\\),\n\\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so that \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) amount to what Herbart\ncalls an \u201cincidental obstacles\u201d to the complete\ncomplication of \\(a\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) (SW V:\n309).[36]\n(The same of course holds for \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\).)\nHence \\(a\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) can at best join in an \u201cincomplete\ncomplication\u201d (SW V: 309). Clearly these make up the vast\nmajority of our compound representations (Felsch 1902: 5).\nFinally: suppose that in one continuum, \\(a\\) is inhibited by \\(b\\)\nto a remainder \\(r\\); whereas in another continuum, \\(\\alpha\\) is\ninhibited by \\(\\beta\\) down to remainder \\(\\rho\\) (SW V:\n317).[37]\nThen\n\nremainders \\(r\\) and \\(\\rho\\) will combine\nthemselves to a total force [Totalkraft] which, however,\ncannot be separated from the [two] whole representations \\(a\\) and\n\\(\\alpha\\), which are not completely connected. (SW V: 317)\n\n If, \\(a\\) were now threatened with further\ninhibition by a newly arising representation, \\(c\\), then because of\nthe combined Totalkraft, \\(\\alpha\\) would in effect\n\u201chelp\u201d \\(a\\) resist the force of\n\\(c\\).[38]\nHerbart calculates \\(\\alpha\\)\u2019s cooperative power at\n\\(\\frac{\\rho\\cdot r}{\\alpha}\\) (SW V: 317\u20138; SW IV: 375).\n3.4 Mechanics of spirit\n3.4.1 Representational \u201cmotion\u201d\nHerbart\u2019s transition from psycho-statics to mechanics\nexhibits a counterintuitive order similar to that encountered above,\nin calculating the inhibition sum before calculating\ninhibition ratio (i.e., calculating the load before its\ndistribution). Thus, we should note that psycho-statics describes the\nlaws of a state reached after the laws of psycho-mechanics\nhave operated on a given set of representations. To clarify:\nconsidered per se, representations are uninhibited,\nradiating at full strength (SW V: 338; PsW: 208). When two or more\nrepresentations appear at once in consciousness, they conflict, and\nover time inhibit or dim each other\u2019s radiance until they reach\nequilibrium (SW V: 338).[39]\n That balanced end-state, and the\ndistribution of the inhibitory load upon each representation at that\nend-state, is the concern of psycho-statics. Psycho-mechanics, by\ncontrast, studies the laws of representational motion, i.e., the laws\ngoverning the preceding conflict between representations\nthat leads to equilibrium (SW IV: 371). By\n\u201cmotion\u201d, Herbart means the falling (and rising) of\nrepresentations with respect to the static threshold, or, more\nprecisely, their dimming (and brightening) with respect to the\nthreshold of awareness (SW V: 338, 339; Boudewijnse, et al. 1999:\n181, ff.; Weiss 1928: 84. Cf. esp. Felsch 1904: 194, f.).\nThis initial pr\u00e9cis of the relation of psycho-statics to\npsycho-mechanics is helpful for understanding Herbart\u2019s claim\nthat \u201cthe inhibition sum [S] must, in accordance with\nits law, continuously fall\u201d (SW IV: 341; cf. SW V: 338; Felsch\n1904: 195; Boudewijnse, et al. 1999: 182; Weiss 1928: 83, f.). This\nstatement, on the face of it, is deeply puzzling, and points to a\nvexing ambiguity in his usage of the term \u201cinhibition\nsum\u201d.  For by speaking of the \u201cfalling\u201d (i.e.,\ndiminution) of the inhibition sum, Herbart gives the impression that\nit is variable. But as our discussion of the inhibition sum above\nshowed, Herbart in psycho-statics conceives it as the sum of the\n(amount of) inhibition each of a number of conflicting\nrepresentations must partially \u201cbear\u201d for them all to\nreach a state of equilibrium. But this sum is in fact a fixed\nquantum,[40]\na constant, dictated by the inherent vivacity of each representation\nand the degree of opposition[41]\n among representations. In a case examined\nabove, S is the load actually borne by a\nand b when they reach equilibrium (cf. 3.3.1.1).\nBut psycho-mechanics is concerned not with the condition\nof a and b in equilibrium, but on the\nway to equilibrium. What phenomenon can we witness here\nthat could be called (loosely) the \u201cfalling of the\ninhibition sum\u201d? Consider now not the end-state of equilibrium,\nbut rather the beginning of the process. Here, at \\(t_0\\), one\nrepresentation a is joined by a second\nrepresentation b. At this first instant, the vivacity of\neach representation is at its uninhibited\nmaximum,[42]\nand therefore the forces of opposition are also maximally\nactive. Notice now that while, as stated above, S, the load\nof forces distributed at equilibrium is a constant already\nfixed by the nature of a and b, these forces,\nat \\(t_0\\), are not at all distributed but active, with a\nand b bearing no load (as yet). Hence, at \\(t_0\\),\none could reasonably call these active forces the \u201cinhibition\nsum\u201d, but not in the sense of the distributed load,\nbut rather in the sense of the load-to-be-distributed\nover a and b. Let us call the distributed load\n\u201cS\u201d, to remain consistent with the use of the\nterm in psycho-statics, but let us call the load-to-be-distributed\n\u201c\\(S_n\\)\u201d, to indicate the load to be distributed at\n\\(t_n\\).[43]\nAs we saw above, Herbart argues that from the instant at\nwhich a and b \u201ccollide\u201d in\nconsciousness, to the point of static equilibrium, a period of time\nmust elapse. While at \\(t_0\\), the oppositional forces are at a\nmaximum,[44]\nat \\(t_1\\) they will already have dimmed each other to an extent; at\n\\(t_2\\) this dimming will have progressed even further; etc. Herbart\nsymbolizes the combined amount of the dimmed portion\nof a and b with\n\u201c\\(\\sigma\\)\u201d.[45]\n Hence we can see that as time passes\nand a and b progressively inhibit each other,\n\\(S_n\\), the load-to-be-distributed, continuously diminishes: this\nis what Herbart means by saying that the inhibition sum falls. And as\n\\(S_n\\) falls, \\(\\sigma\\) increases, that is, the inhibited\namount of a and b increases since they are taking\non as a load a portion of \\(S_n\\). He notes, moreover, that as\n\\(S_n\\) falls\u2014i.e., the forces\u2019 conflicting activity\ndecreases\u2014the inhibitory pressure they exert also decreases (SW V: 339,\ne.g.). Hence, the rate of inhibition and dimming decreases\nover time as well. The situation can be summarized thus: at\nfirst a and b stand in maximal conflict, leading to\nrapid absorption of these forces in the form of dimming; hence, as\nthe active forces decrease, the rate of dimming also decreases,\nas a and b jostle ever more slowly into equilibrium\naround the static point (cf. Felsch 1904: 196). As Felsch writes,\n\u201cthe billowing sea is becalmed but by and by\u201d (Felsch\n1904: 195).\nNow Herbart, in his LPs, rightly calls the laws of psychic motion\n\u201chighly diverse and for the most part very knotty\u201d, and\nrestricts his treatment to just one\nequation:[46]\n\n \\[ \\sigma = S (1 - e^{-t}) \\]\n\nwhere S is the inhibition sum (as eventually distributed;\n\u2260 \u201c\\(S_n\\)\u201d); \\(\\sigma\\) is the combined amount\nof a and b that has at any time t been\ninhibited; and e is the base of the natural\nlogarithm.\n\n\n\nWe can see from the graph that as t grows towards\ninfinity, \\(e^{-t}\\) diminishes towards zero, and so \\(\\sigma\\)\napproaches, but never reaches S. That is, the total amount\nof a and b that is actually inhibited never\nin a finite time attains the inhibition sum; which, in turn, means\nthat a and b never reach complete equilibrium (SW\nIV: 372).\n\nDue to this latter circumstance, in a waking\nperson, even in a state of equanimity, the representations are always\ncaught up in a gentle floating. (SW IV: 372)\nNow one might think that as the representations jostle towards\nequilibrium they will become less \u201cconscious\n[bewusst]\u201d (i.e., less perceptible to consciousness),\nand of course this is true for each inhibited representation with\nrespect to its own (hypothetical) uninhibited start-state. But at\nissue here is the clarity of the representations joined in\nopposition. A moment\u2019s reflection suggests that at the\nmoment of collision, when the inhibition sum \\(S_n\\) is highest, neither\nrepresentation will be at all clear to consciousness, but on the\ncontrary, be least perspicuous; considered separatim, the\nrepresentations will be obscure. Therefore, as \\(S_n\\) falls over\ntime, the representations gradually \u201crise\u201d, becoming more\nand more perspicuous and clear, though less vivacious than in\na solitary state (cf. Felsch 1904: 195; Weiss 1928: 83).\n3.4.2 Reproduction of representations\nAs we saw earlier, Herbart considers representations to be the\n\u201cself-preservings\u201d of the psyche expressed in its, the\npsyche\u2019s, own nature; their multiplicity stems from those\ndisturbances which the psyche resists at each moment of its\nself-preservation (SW V: 387). Representations, once formed, must\nsomehow remain in the psyche, or else no self-consciousness would be\npossible (SW V: 354; 387). Whenever a given disturbance lasts for a\ncertain time, the new representations that are constantly springing\ninto being at every moment begin to accumulate (SW V: 387). For the\npsyche\u2019s self-preservings and the representations are one and the same, just in different relations (SW V:\n401):\n\n\nBy the word, \u201crepresentation\u201d, we \u2026 mean the\nphenomenon insofar as we may encounter it in consciousness; by\ncontrast, the expression, \u201cself-preservation of the psyche\n[Seele]\u201d refers to the real act [realer\nActus], which immediately brings forth the phenomenon. This real\nact is not an object of consciousness, for it is the activity itself\nthat makes consciousness possible. Thus \u201cself-preservation of\nthe psyche\u201d and \u201crepresentation\u201d go together as\naction and occurrence [Thun und Geschehen; i.e., action (and simultaneously\nresulting) occurrence]. (SW V: 401)\nThe \u201csoul\u2019s\u201d self-preservation also continues\nwhen a representation has for a certain time been forced out and\nsupplanted (verdr\u00e4ngt), which is why it can return to\nconsciousness once the occluding factor goes away (SW IV: 376). This\nis the basis of those mental phenomena that Herbart calls\n\u201creproduction of representations\u201d (SW IV: 376).\nThe conditions under which a representation reappears in\nconsciousness determine whether its return is called an\n\u201cimmediate\u201d or a \u201cmediate\u201d reproduction (cf.\nBoudewijnse, et al. 1999: 181; 185, ff.). An immediate reproduction\noccurs when a hitherto inhibited representation strives back up into\nconsciousness under its own power, as it were, as soon as the\noccluding factor has been neutralized (SW IV: 376). Herbart\nwrites:\n\n\nIt is usually the case that a new perception allows the older\nrepresentation of the same or very similar object to step back into\nthe light. This occurs in that the new perception pushes back\neverything that happens to be present in consciousness currently\nopposing the older representation. Immediately the older\n[representation] arises of its own accord without further ado. (SW IV:\n376)\nIn the case of mediate reproduction, on the other hand, a\nrepresentation reenters consciousness not from its own power, but\nthrough the aid of representations with which it is somehow connected.\nThe partial representations mutually help each other as soon as, and\nto the extent that the pressure subsides that suppressed the connection\nas a whole (SW IV: 377). Taken together, these two types of\nreproduction furnish the foundation for recollection and\nmemory.[47]\n3.4.3 Representational series\nMediate reproduction or recollection plays an important role,\nmoreover, in the formation of representational series or sequences\n(Vorstellungsreihen). Time and the quality of the\nrepresentations determine the formation of such series (SW V: 410).\nAssume that perceptual\nrepresentations a, b, c \u2026 appear\nsequentially in consciousness, and are not mutually opposed (SW V:\n410). Representation a, which enters consciousness first, is\nquickly opposed by other representations, which inhibit and dim it,\ncausing it to sink down to the degree\n(\u201cKlarheitsgrad\u201d, Weiss 1928:\n86), r. Next, representation b joins it and fuses\nwith a\u2019s remainder, \\(r'\\). Together, they both\ncontinue to sink, with b now becoming R and \\(r'\\)\nbecoming \\(r''\\). Representations c and d \u2026\njoin them. The following schema becomes apparent (SW V: 410):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\na \\\\\nr    & b \\\\\nr'    & R    & c \\\\\nr''   & R'  & \\rho  & d \\\\\nr'''  & R''  & \\rho' & \\mathfrak{r} & \\mbox{etc.}  \\\\\n.    &  .   &  .       & .  \\\\\n.    &  .   &  .       & .  \\\\\n.    &  .   &  .       & .  \\\\\nr^{(n)} & R^{(n-1)} & \\rho^{(n-2)} & \\mathfrak{r}^{(n-3)} & \\mbox{etc.}\n\\end{array}\n\n\\]\n\nNow suppose the entire series were suppressed to\nthe limen.  If one representation-member of the\nseries were allowed to rise back into consciousness, it would have a\n\u201creproductive effect\u201d upon all its fellows (namely in\naccordance with the laws of reproduction laid out in \u00a788; SW V:\n372, ff., esp. 375, f.). If the first representation, a,\nrises as an \u201cimmediate reproduction\u201d, it then most quickly\npulls b up after it, since b is most completely\nfused with r; but somewhat more slowly c, and with\never decreasing speed, d, etc. (Stout calls this the\n\u201cevolution\u201d of a series; Stout 1888a: 335). But\nif c, that is, a representation somewhere in the middle of\nthe sequence were the first to resurface, then, because it\nis fused with \\(r'\\) and R\u2014the remnants\nof a and b\u2014these latter will be dragged past\nthe limen simultaneously (Stout calls this the\n\u201cinvolution\u201d of a series; Stout 1888a: 335); on the other\nhand, d, e, \u2026 will follow in succession (SW\nV: 410\u201311).[48]\n3.5 Geist and Gem\u00fcth: the life of the mind\nHerbart is of course very concerned to demonstrate the superiority\nof his system over other, traditional conceptions of mind (SW VI: 53).\nIn particular, he wants to head off critics of mathematical psychology\nwho argue that \u201cmathematics merely determines quanta, whereas\npsychology deals primarily with qualities\u201d (LPs [1850]: 29). He\ntherefore turns from the statics and mechanics of Geist (soul\nas representing) to the special theory of the\n\u201cGem\u00fct\u201d (soul as feeling and desiring), in\norder to show how the latter can be incorporated into the former (LPs\n[1850]: 29; SW VI: 56, f.).\nFor Herbart, Gem\u00fct\u2014which I will here translate\nas \u201cdisposition\u201d\u2014has its seat within Geist;\nput another way, it is our state of mind. Hence,\n\nfeeling and desire are in the first place states\n[Zust\u00e4nde] of representations, to wit, for the most\npart, mutable states thereof (LPs [1850]: 29)\n\n when we feel, something is always simultaneously\nrepresented, and the feeling is contained in that\nrepresentation (LPs [1850]: \n32).[49]\n Again, when we desire, we always also\nrepresent that which we desire (cf. Aristotle, Metaphysics\n\u039b7, 1072a26, ff.).\nHerbart develops his theory of disposition on the basis of\npersisting (stehende) and rising (steigende)\nrepresentations (SW VI:\n 57).[50]\n That is, all dispositions must ultimately\nbe explicable in terms of persisting or rising representations, and\nnothing else. Taking first the case of a representation (or\nrepresentational series) R that stands still in\nconsciousness, its persistence may be due to the simultaneous and\ncountervailing forces exerted on it by rising and inhibiting\nrepresentations, \\(R_r\\) and \\(R_i\\), respectively. Hence we\nwill feel the state of R as a \u201ccompression\n[Klemmung]\u201d between \\(R_r\\) and \\(R_i\\) (SW VI: 64;\n58; cf. LPs (1850): 31) and such states are \u201cunpleasant\nfeelings\u201d (SW VI: 59). On the other hand, if a\nrepresentation R rises, then it may encounter an obstacle\nthat is not strong enough to prevent it from rising, or it may be\naided by advantageous forces (SW VI: 58\u20139). Since these forces\naffect the real activity of representing, Herbart argues that we\ncannot be unconscious of their pressure upon or aid of R:\n\nBut these [impingements upon R] are not\n[themselves] objects of representing, but merely\nthe way in which the representing is happening; these\ndeterminations of consciousness, insofar as it transcends the mere\nrepresenting as such, must be called \u201cfeelings\u201d\n[Gef\u00fchle]. (SW VI: 58)\nWhat then, on Herbart\u2019s view, is desire?\n\u201cFeelings\u201d accompany representations that, as they rise,\nbecome continuously more \u201ceffective\u201d (SW VI: 59). By\n\u201ceffective\u201d, he means that the representation in question\ndetermines more and more representations akin to it, while at the same\ntime inhibiting those that are not (SW VI: 59). \u201cDesire\u201d,\nthen, is the consciousness of a representation\u2019s rising struggle\ntowards ever-brighter light, and of its corresponding\n\u201ctension\u201d as it works itself up and over obstacles (SW VI:\n59).\nHerbart extends his interpretation of feeling and desire to the\nphenomena of affect[51]\n and passion, the \u201cstrongest\nexpressions of feeling and desire [respectively]\u201d (SW VI:\n75). In both cases it is important to see that the force of\nboth affect and passion inheres in the representations themselves;\nwhen these forces are compressed or relaxed beyond the static point,\nthey produce tension within the masses of representations, which\nmanifests itself as affect (Weiss 1928: 90).  Both result from\nmovements, not of individual representations, but of fused\nrepresentational masses well past their point of equilibrium (SW VI:\n75; cf. Weiss 1928: 89). Thus, if a \u201clarger amount of actual\nrepresentation is raised into consciousness than can subsist there\n[all at once]\u201d, the result is an \u201cebullient\u201d affect\n(SW VI: 75).[52]\n By contrast, if a larger mass is banished\nbeneath the limen, the psychic barometer falls as well,\nresulting in a \u201cmelting\u201d affect (SW VI: 75). Just as low\natmospheric pressure provokes stormy weather, so too the\ndisappearance of a representational mass loosens and unleashes those masses\nthat remain (SW VI: 75\u20136). These suddenly far exceed the static\npoint, their violent expression taking the form, e.g., of rage or\nfear (SW VI: 75\u20136). This also explains why affects are always\ntransient moods, since representations always strive to return over\ntime to a state of equilibrium (SW VI:\n75).[53]\n3.6 Spatio(-temporal) representations\nBecause our desires and feelings are inextricably intertwined with\nrepresentations of our environment, we are naturally led to inquire into our perception of things in the world; this in turn\nrequires an analysis of types of spatial and temporal\nrepresentation (SW VI: 86). Not concerning himself here\nwith the abstract concepts of space and time, Herbart instead looks to\nthe genesis of spatial perception (r\u00e4umliche\nAuffassungen) in earliest childhood. He notes that children\nirreversibly acquire, through practice, such\nperception:\n\n\nThe child\u2019s hand first learns to grasp, the eye first\nlearns to direct itself appropriately; but the adult\ninvoluntarily achieves what he learned; moreover, the pure sensible\nperception [of the child] is obscured by additions that his\ntraining [Ausbildung] mixes in. (SW VI:\n86)[54]\nSimilarly, although there are those who can do without\nsophisticated, acquired concepts of temporal magnitudes, roughly\nnoting the slower and the faster, yet once we learn rhythm and the\ndivision of time, we cannot return to the more primitive\nstate. Herbart thus disputes the notion that space and time are\noriginary facilities or faculties: the spatial and temporal are\nrather acquired, \u201ctrained, even artificial\nconceptions\u201d (SW VI: 86).\nHerbart now faces a problem. All spatial and temporal differences,\nsuch as right and left, or earlier and later, lie in the\nrepresentation, not in the act of representing (SW VI: 87). Yet\nbecause representing must precede the represented,\nthe soul must, through its representational activity\u2014which,\nitself, exhibits no spatio-temporal differences\u2014introduce\nspatio-temporal relations into the representation. Yet the\nrepresentation is not real; and, qu\u0101\nrepraesent\u0101tum, it cannot \u201creally\n[wirklich] be separated out in space or time\u201d:\n\u201cthe actual [wirkliche] psychological event of spatial\nrepresenting is something altogether non-spatial\u201d, just as\n\u201cthe representing of the temporal is something in which there\nis nothing of the thereby represented time\u201d (SW VI:\n89).[55]\nHerbart addresses the problem by appeal to the laws of reproduction\n(treated in the section on psycho-mechanics, above) (SW VI: 89). The\nrepresenting (activity) of the spatial must in some\nway resemble the spatial itself, or else its\nspatial repraesent\u0101tum would in no way be\n\u201cspatial\u201d.  And this resemblance lies in the\nmulti-dimensional nature of the interweaving of representational\nseries. As Stout simplifies Herbart\u2019s presentation,\n  interweaving means that from each term of a\ngiven series[,] trains of reproduction start, which are in their turn\nat once separated and interconnected by cross-series. On the side of\nthe presented content[,] regular mechanical interweaving is\ncorrelated with the consciousness of a spatial order\u2026. (Stout\n1888a: 338; SW VI: 89)\nIt is in this interconnection of \u201ccross-series\u201d that\nHerbart identifies the appearance of a lateral or\n\u201cneighboring\u201d ordering (eines Neben\neinander geordneten). The crucial element in this order\n(which applies not only to space but also to time and number\n(cf. Natorp 1910, and esp. SW VI: 110, ff. (\u00a7116)) is the\n\u201cgradation in the representations\u2019 connection\n[Abstufung in der Verbindung der Vorstellungen]\u201d laid\nout in psycho-mechanics (above) (SW VI: 90). Only now, as we apply\nthat abstract doctrine to experience, we see that the small number of\nrepresentations used for illustrative purposes \\((a, b, c, d,\n\\ldots)\\), together with their dimmed remainders \\((r, R, \\rho,\n\\mathfrak{r} \\ldots)\\), are far too few to account for the innumerable\nrepresentations generated by the minima visibilia\nand tangibilia of actual experience (SW VI: 90). Herbart\nwrites:\n\nWith every sense-contact of the spatial, every\nlittle colored or touchable place [Stelle] produces its own\nrepresentation; and every representation fuses with every other. (SW\nVI: 90)\n\n The picture he paints here is astonishing: as we\nsee and touch the world\u2014in particular, as one \u201cmoves the\nobserving eye and the touching finger forwards\nand backwards\u201d\u2014not only do we generate an\nunfathomable manifold of visible and tangible representations at any\ntime t, but each of these representations in turn produces a\ntrain of innumerable fading, graded fusions with all the others (SW\nVI: 90).  Thus innumerable series are generated and become interwoven\n(Weiss 1928: 92). The constantly generated perceptual representations\ngradually sink and shade away, fusing less and less with those\ntrailing after (SW VI: 90). But at the slightest return (i.e., due to\nthe finger or eye moving in reverse of its initial direction), all\nthe earlier percepts, now aided by the very similar new-comers, begin\nto rise, which rising is associated with\n\na nisus [upward pressure] to reproduce\nall those remaining [representation], whose [rising] velocity has\nexactly the same gradations as the earlier [graded] fusions. (SW VI:\n90)\nHow does this picture begin to explain the spatial character of\nvisual and tangible representations? The key is that any of\nthe earlier acquired percepts can, in rising, pull up over\nthe limen all the others, to wit, in their ordered\nplaces next to or between each other, and this all the while that\nthe act of representing remains \u201cpurely\nintensive\u201d (SW VI: 91). Thus the spatiality of our (visual)\nrepresentations is a function not of immediate sensation, but of an\ninterior process that lends perception \u201cspatial form\u201d,\nnamely those already present representations that reappear, governed\nby a law according to which each representation affects, in a regular\nway, the appearance of the others connected to it (SW VI: 91). Herbart\nwrites:\n\nInsofar as the instantaneous [new]\nsense-perception [Wahrnehmung] fuses with the already ordered\nrepresentation, it too becomes ordered; and in this way the persisting\nperception is incorporated in a continuous transition to spatial\nform. (SW VI: 91)\n\n Temporal representations are generated in a\nsimilar way, viz., in accordance with the laws governing the\nreproduction of the continuously woven tissue of representations (for\na more detailed account of the generation of temporal representation,\nsee Stout 1888b: 474, ff.).\n3.7 Higher cognition\n3.7.1 Thinking things\nWe do not perceive \u201cthe spatial\u201d or \u201cthe\ntemporal\u201d as such, but only ever things in space,\nor events in time\n (SW VI: 112).[56]\n Herbart again explains this fact in\nterms of the \u201ccomplete and sufficient explanatory ground\u201d\nof the psyche\u2019s unity (SW VI: 116). The soul\u2019s unity\nnecessitates that our representations of things, and the events taking\nplace among them, originally constitute themselves out of the simple\nsensations of the particular senses. Therefore, all our\nrepresentations would present (darstellen) only a single\nobject that would be neither spatial nor temporal, without parts, and\nimmune to differentiation\u2014except for the inhibitions and\noppositions that underlie the simple sensations of the particular\nsenses in their mutual encounters in the psyche (SW VI: 115, e.g.;\ncf. Stout 1888b: 478).  This is what conditions the multiplicity of\nthings and events: they are nothing other than the determinate\ngroupings of sensations in our consciousness (Weiss 1928:\n93).\n3.7.2 Conceptual thinking\nBut if our sensible representations would, in themselves, present a\nsimple, partless, Parmenidean object beyond time and space, how is it\nthat they in fact seem to represent distinct things in our\nawareness? At first glance Herbart would seem to be presenting the\nKantian picture of a chaotic sensible manifold, upon which a\nspontaneous Understanding could work its synthetic operations. But in\nkeeping with his anti-faculty position, Herbart argues instead for a\nkind of \u201cpassive synthesis\u201d avant la lettre (SW\nVI: 116), by which certain representations are connected and collected\ninto separate unities, but spontaneously, motivated solely from\nwithin, in accordance with the laws of psycho-mechanics and\npsycho-statics (cf.  esp. SW VI: 114, ff.).\nHerbart proceeds by giving a\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d[57]\n account of concept formation, that is,\nof representation-masses that, over time, develop into\ninstruments by which we become conscious of things, and\nultimately of ourselves. Thus, while there is \u201cno doubt that\njust as concepts arise out of sense-perceptions\n[Wahrnehmungen], so, too, do clear concepts arise out of\nunclear[58]\nconcepts\u201d\u2014nevertheless, these processes must be explained\nwithout recourse to a deus ex machina one calls \u201cthe\nUnderstanding\u201d (SW VI: 117).\nAnticipating the battles over logical psychologism of the late\n19th and early 20th centuries, Herbart carefully\ndistinguishes between a psychological and a logical sense of\n\u201cconcept\u201d (SW VI: 119\u201320; cf. Stout 1888b: 477; van\nder Schaar 2013: 83).  He writes:\n\nEvery thought [c\u014dgit\u0101tum],\nconsidered merely according to its quality [sc. qu\u0101\nc\u014dgit\u0101tum], is a concept in the logical sense. (SW VI:\n119)\n\n By \u201cconcept in the logical sense\u201d, he means the\nrepresented\ncontent considered apart from the psychological\nconditions and circumstances of its presentation at this or that time\nto this or that individual mind. (Stout 1888b: 477)\n\n Thus, concepts offer \u201ca common knowledge\nfor all men and all times\u201d, and, as such, are nothing\npsychological (SW VI: 120). Psychology, by contrast,\ninvestigates real thinking, and tries to determine how\nconcepts come to be actually thought. As a thought-content\nof consciousness, then, a \u201cconcept\u201d is a representation, namely one\n\u201cwhich has as its represented [content] the concept in\nthe logical sense\u201d (SW VI: 120), or, as Weiss puts it,\n\u201cthat representation through which\nthe repraesentandum[59]\n (i.e., the logical concept) is represented\nin reality\u201d (Weiss 1928:\n 94).[60]\nWhat, then, distinguishes a (psychological) concept from other mental\ncontents, like sensations, imaginings, or memories? Because the soul\nis, ex hypothesi, a tabula rasa, there are neither\noriginal concepts (like Kant\u2019s categories) nor faculties of\nconcepts (like Kant\u2019s Understanding or Reason): \u201call\nconcepts are things that have come to be\u201d (SW VI: 120;\ncf. esp. SW VI: 129, ff.). The incipient concept must therefore find\nits origin in the psyche\u2019s attempt to preserve itself, that is,\nits inherent simplicity, in the face of an outside disturbance. A\nrepresentation in the process of coming to be is called a sensation\n(Empfindung) or perception (Wahrnehmung) (SW VI:\n120). Upon entering consciousness, it is immediately subject to\ninhibition by other, already present representations. When, under\ncertain circumstances, it returns to consciousness, the representation\nis called an \u201cimagining [Einbildung]\u201d, and, as we\nsaw in our discussion of representational reproduction, when this\nreproduced imagining connects with a series of fused (temporal)\nrepresentations, it may become a memory (SW VI: 121).\nWhen, then, do concepts arise? They are not generated as individual\nrepresentations at a particular point in time, nor do we have them in\naddition to sensations and imaginings. Rather,\n\n\nwe ascribe concepts to ourselves insofar as we abstract from the\nentrance of our representations into consciousness, and instead\nreflect upon the fact that they exist there, and now in fact allow\ntheir \nrepraesent\u0101tum[61]\n (the concept in the logical sense) to appear\n[in consciousness]. (SW VI: 121) \nSo, if the psychological concept is to have as\nits repraesent\u0101tum just the content of the logical\nconcept (its repraesentandum) and nothing more, then the\npsychological concept would have to shed all its peculiar and\ncontingent traits, all of the complexions and fusions that have\ninevitably accrued to it in its own generation and reproduction (SW\nVI: 121). How is this possible?  First, through a process of isolation\ninto a \u201ccrude\u201d or \u201cconfused\u201d concept (SW VI:\n125); second, through the crude concept\u2019s analysis by means of\njudgments; and third, through the classification of these judgments\n(cf. Stout 1888b: 477; Weiss (1928) overlooks the first step).\nIsolation occurs as many representational series are progressively\ncurtailed, in accordance with the laws of reproduction. Thus, if\nthere we take two similar sensations, a and b,\nHerbart argues that as b is occurring, a reproduces\nitself as an imagining, together with all its fusions and\ncomplications.[62]\n If now a third similar sensation,\nc, appears, then a and b, together with their\nconnections (and connections of connections) reproduce themselves,\nbut \u201cnow there is already an inhibition, as the connections of\nthe one and the other will differ\u201d (SW VI: 123). Imagine now\nthat new, similar sensations flow in by the hundreds or thousands:\n\u201cit is evident that then diverse associations of all the\npreceding [sensations] will be as good as extinguished in their\nreproduction\u201d, letting only a tiny amount of each enter\nconsciousness (SW VI: 123). Nevertheless, all these small amounts add\nup to a considerable total vivacity (Totalkraft), and this\nfused representation is tantamount to a concept. In other words, as\nsimilar elements of representational sequences fuse, the opposing\nlinks of these series cancel each other out, leaving only the fused\ntotal force shining forth surrounded by a \u201cdim margin of\ncompeting alternatives\u201d (Stout 1888b: 478). Having seen one and\nthe same man in various positions, moods, clothes and places, then,\nshould we see him again, the total-representation that now\nappears is the concept of this \nman.[63]\n According to Herbart, crude general\nconcepts of objects and events arise analogously to these incipient\nindividual ones (SW VI: 124\u20135).\nHaving shown how incipient concepts arise as the strong, common\nnodes of reproduced series of similar representations, he proceeds to\nshow how, given such nodular representations, they can be definitely\ndiscriminated into subject and predicate, viz. a judgment (Stout\n1888b: 478). He observes that the assimilation of a new sensation to\nearlier, similar representations can be regarded as (analogous to) a\njudgment of a crude psychological, if not of a logical sort:\n\nthe sensation provides the subject; the fusion is\n\u2026 the copula; the earlier representation now fusing with [the\npresently occurring] sensation takes the position of the\npredicate. (SW VI: 126; cf.  Stout 1888b: 479)\n\n Although in this case, the subject and predicate\nfuse so quickly and imperceptibly as to be indistinguishable, yet it\nprovides the template of the conscious separation of subject\nand predicate, and hence of logical judgments proper. To wit: if and\nwhen the fusion is somehow hampered or delayed, then its beginning,\nmiddle, and end are able to \u201chave their say\u201d (SW VI:\n126).  Specifically, at first the newly arrived representation (i.e.,\nthe sensation) of the subject subsists alone in consciousness. As it\nstarts to sink, the representation of the predicate rises, exerting\nan influence\u2014partly inhibiting, partly promoting\u2014on the\nrepresentational sequences extending out from the subject as they\nstrive to evolve. \u201cThe copula appears in the middle as the\nexpression of that change in disposition which takes place in the\nfusion\u201d of the subject and predicate (SW VI:\n126).[64]\n3.8 Apperception\n3.8.1 Background\nHerbart is perhaps most famous for his theory of apperception and\nits application to the problems of the ego and self-consciousness\n(Boring 1950: 256\u20137; Stout 1888b: 498). He considers these\nnotions and their metaphysical elaboration as faculties or powers to\nbe nonsense, giving rise to paradoxes of self-consciousness; for\nexample, \u201ca faculty of self-observation [introspection]\u201d\nraises the specter of an infinite regress of\n\u201cself\u201d-observing powers (SW VI: 140). This is not to deny\nthat ego, self-consciousness, or self-perception answer to genuine\npsychological phenomena. Rather, it is to set a task for psychology,\nnamely how to account for these psychological facts solely in terms of\nrepresentations and without recourse to faculties, since\n\nin the soul there are only representations; and\nout of these everything must be composed that is to appear in\nconsciousness. (SW VI: 141)\n\n Because Herbart\u2019s theory of apperception is\nultimately about the formation (Bildung) or structuring of\nthe ego, it also provides the cornerstone of his theory of education\n(Bildung) (Hayward 1907: 15; Boring 1950: 257; Weiss 1928:\n98).\nAs we have seen, representations never appear singly, but\ncontinuously interact, complicating and fusing with or inhibiting\neach other. They form sequences and series, which, in turn, get\ninterwoven with each other, forming stable groupings called\nrepresentational masses. Simply put, \u201capperception\u201d is\nHerbart\u2019s term for the assimilation of one representation or\nrepresentational mass into another. In this section I will explain\nnot only the mechanism of this process, but also why Herbart calls it\n\u201capperception\u201d.[65]\n3.8.2 Mechanics of apperception\nWe earlier dealt with the fusion and complication of\nrepresentations, i.e., with the laws governing the formation of\nrepresentational series and masses. We are therefore already familiar\nwith the laws of the assimilative process called\n\u201capperception\u201d, but only from the \u201coutside\u201d,\nobserving the representational masses objectively. To understand the\nassimilative process as \u201capperception\u201d proper, we must\nnow recall that representations are not (merely) represented\n\u201cobjects\u201d of consciousness (repraesent\u0101ta),\nbut (also)\u2014as perturbations of the\nsoul\u2014representing \u201csubjects\u201d of\nconsciousness (repraesentantia). In other words,\nrepresentations, as bewu\u00dft or\nconscious,[66]\n must be (also) conceived as\n\u201cobserving\u201d, of \u201cbeing-aware\u201d\n(beobachtend). Always keeping this peculiar characteristic\nof Herbartian representations in mind, let us consider his\ninterpretation of the phenomenon that has been (in his view)\nmistakenly called \u201cinner sense\u201d or a \u201cfaculty of\nself-observation [Selbst-Beobachtung, i.e.,\nintrospection]\u201d. He writes:\n\nOne representation (or representation-mass) is\nobserved; another representation (or representation-mass) is\nthe observer. (SW VI: 141; emphasis added)\nIn order to support this claim, Herbart considers two cases: (a)\nthe assimilation of a sense-representation (a \u201csensum\u201d),\ncalled \u201couter apperception\u201d; and (b) the assimilation of a\nreproduced (i.e., recollected) representation from below\nthe limen, called \u201cinner apperception\u201d (Stout\n1888b: 448). The latter is treated as analogous to the former (Stout\n1889: 448).\n3.8.2.1 Outer apperception\nA new sense perception or perceptual series, \\(W, w, \\mathfrak{w},\n\\omega\\) (\u201c\\(W\\)\u201d for Wahrnehmung, sense\nperception), always appears in an arena of consciousness already\noccupied by some older representation or representational group, \\(R,\nr, \\mathfrak{r}, \\rho\\) (SW VI: 143). At first, the \u201cunarrested\nintensity\u201d of \\(W, w, \\ldots\\) gives it as it were the drop on\nthe pre-existing representations, initially forcing them down against\nthe threshold (Stout 1888b: 484; SW VI: 143). At the same time, in\naccordance with the psycho-mechanical laws of reproduction, elements\nof the new series (e.g., \\(w, \\mathfrak{w}\\)) reawaken the\nsubliminal similars amongst the older representations (e.g.,\n\\(r,\\mathfrak{r}\\)), and fuse with these, while simultaneously\ninhibiting the dissimilars (e.g., \\(R, \\rho\\)). But the\nsimilars (\\(r, \\mathfrak{r}\\)), being themselves more strongly bound to\nthe dissimilars (\\(R, \\rho\\)) (as members of the same mass), gradually\ndraw up the latter, and so the whole mass \\((R, r, \\mathfrak{r}, \\rho)\\)\nreturns more strongly to inhibit \\(W, w, \\ldots\\) (cf. esp. Stout\n1888b: 484). As Stout points out, the returning pre-formation \\((R, r,\n\\ldots)\\) would seem likely to suppress \\(W, w, \\ldots\\) except for\ntheir \u201cpoints of affinity\u201d:\n\nSo far as they are homogeneous they fuse. The\nappercipient group retains in consciousness what is kindred to itself,\nand at the same time represses what is antagonistic. (Stout 1888b:\n485)\n\n Hence\n\nthe sense-given group \\([W, w, \\ldots]\\) becomes\n[after considerable modification] incorporated with the pre-existing\nsystem of presentations \\([R, r, \\ldots]\\). (Stout 1888b:\n485)\n3.8.2.2 Inner apperception\nThe process of outer apperception provides the model for inner\napperception (SW VI: 141). Simply replace the sensa \\(W,\nw,\\ldots\\) with a relatively weak representational series \\(m, n, o,\n\\boldsymbol{p}, q, \\ldots\\) already present in (as opposed to newly\nentering) the soul. If now there is in consciousness at the same time\na second \u201cstable and powerful mass\u201d, \\(P, \\mathrm{P},\n\\boldsymbol{p}, \\pi, \\ldots\\), the two series will complicate with or\n\u201cfold into\u201d each other, generating some new complex (such\nas \\(Pm\\) or \\(Pn\\)) that has elements from each series (Stout 1888b:\n485). Now from each member of the new complex, two chains of\nreproduction will evolve, e.g., in the case of \\(Pm\\), one from \\(P\\),\nand another from \\(m\\). Each of these two chains strives to unfold\nitself according to its own law. But because both series contain the\ncommon member \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\), the evolving chains must fuse at\nthis node and so reinforce each other. As in the case of outer\napperception, the m-series is initially more vivacious and\ndepresses the P-series. As they interact, the greater\nstrength and coherence of the P-series reacts,\n\u201c[re-]form[ing] the [weaker m-series] in its own\nimage\u201d: the stronger mass preserves the similar elements in the\nweaker by fusing with it, while driving it back at other, dissimilar\npoints (SW VI: 144). From the point at which the two chains are fused\nat \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\), their respective reproductions cannot continue,\nas they would have separately. Instead, they now become interwoven\ninto a new representational mass with \u201ca new total-force\u201d\n(SW VI: 141).\nIn both inner and outer apperception, we find a stronger and more\nstable structure into which a relatively unsettled and hence weaker\nelement is integrated. They are drawn together at nodes of\nsimilarity, while dissimilarity blocks a complete fusion. As a result\nof this contest of forces, the weaker element gets stuck or\n\u201cfixed\u201d by the stronger. Now recall that both stronger\nand weaker elements on this account are representings;\ntherefore the stronger one will be the observ-ing\n(\u201cawar-ing\u201d) consciousness, while the weaker one, while\nnot un-conscious (for it is stuck above\nthe limen), is the observ-ed. In the above example,\nthe m-series will be \u201cobserved\u201d \u201clike an\nobject\u201d by the P-series (SW VI:\n144).[67] It\nis just this unbalanced relation between representations (or\nrepresentational structures and elements) that constitutes the\nphenomenon of self-perception, i.e., apperception.\n3.8.3 Apperception and perception\nHerbart\u2019s account of apperception is closely linked to the\nphenomenon of attention, for, as Stout puts it, \u201cto be in\nconsciousness is not the same thing as to be an [explicit] object of\nconsciousness\u201d:\n\n[t]here is always a dim margin of\n[re]presentations, which, though not distinctly attended to, are none\nthe less components of the total conscious state. (Stout 1888b: 485)\n\n Consider the following situation: one is\nengrossed in an activity like reading or a game, and so fails to\nnotice a background noise, like a refrigerator\u2019s hum. Only when\nthe hum \u201csuddenly\u201d stops do we realize that it had been\n\u201cin our consciousness\u201d all along, yet without being an\n\u201cobject of consciousness\u201d.  Hence, if to perceive is to\nattend, then sense perception depends on an apperceiving mass (Stout\n1888b: 486). It is only when the dimmed representation begins to fuse\nwith the vivacious grouping at the center of awareness that the\nformer\n\nacquire[s] that peculiar distinctness, which we\nexpress by saying that we notice it, observe it, or attend to it, or\nthat it is an object of notice, observation or attention.  (Stout\n1888b: 485)\n\n Thus, in one respect, sensation always precedes\napperception, namely insofar as all representations and their\ngroupings originate in sensory disturbances (SW VI: 143). Yet\ngenuine perception, even of sensa, depends in turn\non apperception, for only apperception allows us to attend\nto the sensed \u201cas\u201d or \u201cin terms of\u201d the\napperceiving mass to which it is being assimilated (Stout 1888b: 485,\nf., \u00a729). As we saw in Section 3.7.2, this is just to\nsay that we need a representational mass called a\n\u201cconcept\u201d in order to recognize a new representation as\nan instance of it, and thus in the full sense to perceive it at\nall.\n3.8.4 Apperception, self-control, and education\nApperception is closely connected to morality, as we will see in\nmore detail in the section on Herbart\u2019s ethics. It is\ninteresting to note, however, that even in his discussion of inner\nperception (or as we might call it, \u201cself-awareness\u201d), his\nexamples all have a normative dimension. Thus, as in the case of an\nunattended external humming noise, which we suddenly realize\nhas been going on in the margin of consciousness, so too we most\neasily recognize inner perception when it lapses, e.g., when\none lets slip a secret, or inappropriately laughs or yawns (SW VI:\n145). One ought to have noticed and resisted the incipient\nimpulses towards these actions (SW VI: 145). In\nshort, self-control is a case of inner perception. Hence, in\nthe case of \u201cweak or uneducated people, children, and esp. of\nanimals\u201d, one does not \u201cexpect them to mark their inner\nconditions\u201d (SW VI: 145).\nOn Herbart\u2019s theory, such cases of failing to arrest or\n\u201cfix\u201d a representational evolution may be explained by the\nabsence of representational masses sufficiently articulated and\nstrengthened, not just into \u201cconcepts\u201d, but into clear\njudgments formed out of these concepts, which are called\n\u201cmaxims\u201d (SW VI: 146). It is the educated person\nwho \u201cshould know better\u201d, who is expected to have maxims\nthat arise to ward off foolish, inappropriate, or unethical impulses.\nThese \u201cmaxim\u201d-masses are called \u201cinner\nperceptions\u201d (self-consciousness or self-control) just when they\nsuccessfully \u201coutstrip, fix, and govern\n[beherrschen]\u201d rough and precipitate excitations (SW\nVI: 146).\nThe German word for \u201ceducation\u201d is\n\u201cBildung\u201d, literally: \u201cformation\u201d.\nNow, apperception depends on the action of dominant representational\nmasses, and self-control and self-awareness are functions of\napperception. Thus the educator has a keen interest in forming or\nshaping the incipient concept- and maxim-masses in the young. Unless\nraw masses are strengthened and clarified, they will remain\n\u201cmere heaps [of representations] lacking inner formation and\norder [Ausbildung und Anordnung], as in the case of rough\npersons\u201d (SW VI: 147). The more reticulated representational\nchains become, the more defined, stable, and effective are the\nresulting concept-masses. These in turn allow for the most acute\nperception, as a\n\nskilled musician \u2026 will pick out of a\nlarge choir of voices the one which is at fault \u2026 [or the]\nphysician perceives in an instant symptoms which have escaped the long\nand anxious scrutiny\n\n of the inexpert (Stout 1888b: 486).  Similarly,\nthe development of moral concepts will produce the morally perceptive\nperson, as we will discuss in Section 5.\n3.8.5 Apperception and ego-consciousness\nApperception or \u201cself-consciousness\u201d seems naturally to\ninvolve the notion of the ego or \u201cI\u201d: for what could\nself-consciousness be other than a self or ego that has somehow turned\nits thought back upon itself, so as to be simultaneously subject and\nobject of awareness? (SW VI: 169) Now Herbart believes that his\naccount of apperception will reveal the substantial \u201cI\u201d to\nbe but an illusion generated by the interplay among differential\nrepresentational masses (SW VI: 141). Nevertheless, although there is\nno such thing as the \u201cego\u201d, yet this does not\nmean that there is no phenomenon answering to the word,\n\u201cI\u201d. We constantly make use of the first-person singular\npronoun, which somehow expresses a first-person awareness,\nan ego-consciousness, and this psychological state is clearly\nof central importance. Herbart tries to explain the ego (correctly\nconceived) in naturalistic terms, viz. as the evolution of\nrepresentational masses from childhood to adulthood.\nHe analyzes the genesis of self-consciousness as the evolution\nof apperception. From a complex of bodily sensations, desires, and\naversions, the child becomes aware of representations\nin other beings, which it conceives as pictures carried\naround in their bodies.  As that conception joins with observed\nintentional activities in animals and people\u2014i.e., actions they\ncarry out for their own satisfaction\u2014the \u201citself\u201d\narises, though in the third person. Only when such recursive phenomena\nare apperceived within my own body does the representation\nof my self arise (SW VI: 177). This bodily self, then,\nappears as the \u201cgathering place\u201d not just of my\nrepresentations, but also as the \u201corigin of all\nmovements connected physiologically with bodily feelings\u201d,\nthe pole of all attraction and repulsion.\n3.8.5.1 The growth of ego-consciousness\nThis nexus persists through time, and constantly receiving\nadditions, forming and reforming itself. Hence, Bildung, in\nthe most literal sense, is the constant accumulation\nof Bilder (pictures) around this node (SW VI: 177). As the\nhuman being begins to reflect upon its \u201cself\u201d, it becomes\naware of its overriding determination as a representing,\nknowing, cognizing entity; and the further\nits Bildung advances, the more this conviction grows (SW VI:\n178; 180). Hence, \u201cI\u201d, the being that exists in this way,\nbecome aware of myself as not a thing, but an act-ing.\nEspecially important for the Ausbildung or development of\nself-consciousness is the reminiscence of the past. For in this way\none comes to see a difference between that center of past\n(psychic) conditions and current ones; hence all psychic conditions\nare recognized as accidental: the individual itself cannot be\nreduced to any one of them, and hence appears, in apperception, to\nstand forth as distinct from them (SW VI: 179). Thus, we come\nincreasingly to see our selves as distinct from our external\nenvironment, and from the here and now, and a (representational)\ncomplex emerges \u201cof which all the component parts may be\nnegated, so that none of them seems essential to it\u201d\u2014and\nthis is the ego (SW VI: 180).\nAlthough the ego comes into focus through reflection on its own\npast, yet it is always in the present, projecting itself into the\nfuture. This leads to the conception of the ego as a\n\u201cdrive\u201d (SW VI: 182). But a drive to sense,\nexperience, or act always implies a goal. Hence \u201cthe ego appears\nmost clearly in its outer activity\u201d (SW VI: 182):\nit represents its action to itself, and assumes a cognitive\ndistance from its actions. \u201cIt knows what it is about to do, and\nit also knows what it did\u201d (SW VI: 182). In this way, the ego\nprogressively abstracts itself from its activity, and eventually\nappears to itself as a \u201cmere knowing that now has no\nobject\u201d (SW VI: 182). Further, by being with others in public,\nwe come to notice an inner private sphere; for while other people and\nthings may appear opaque, \u201cthe ego is always present to\nitself\u201d (SW VI: 183). Thus the educated (gebildet)\nperson comes to ascribe\n\na soul to himself, indeed a character,\n[which he respects] as higher than the body. The inner perception is\n[now] seen as the source of knowledge of the true self. (SW VI:\n186)\n3.8.5.2 Dispelling the illusion of the ego\nHerbart continues:\n\n\nBut now comes philosophical reflection, which denies true\nself-knowledge to inner perception. It does not care about\nthe temporal being, the individual, but wants to\nknow about its [sc. the individual\u2019s] enduring and\nfixed foundation. It now discovers itself gradually, viz. that\nperception utterly lacks the actual soul-essence, the substance of the\nsoul; and that such a substance has to be attached to it in\nthought\u2026. Nevertheless, the ego remains the genuine, ever\nselfsame identity of the representing with the represented [thing].\nThis ego appears as a given, as the most secure and indisputable fact\nof consciousness. \u2026 A peculiar kind of cognition is invented\nfor this: a pure, intellectual power. But if one\nasks what this [thing] is, which intellectual intuition\nintuits, there appears the absurd concept of an ego severed from the individual. (SW VI: 186; cf. Beiser 2014:\n133)\nThus, the ego reaches the complete illusion of itself as a\nperduring substance.\n3.8.5.3 The method of relations, again\nHerbart corrects this metaphysical illusion of the ego-soul through\nhis method of relations.\n\nAs with all concepts that lack an essential\ncomponent [yet] to which they stand in relation,\nwithout containing it or immediately indicating it: so here,\ntoo, in the case of the ego, the illusion lies in this, that one\nimagines this concept to be thinkable [even] after separating out\neverything particular and individual. (SW VI: 187)\n\n In other words, abstracted from its\n\u201ccontents\u201d, the ego does not exist: it\n\n\nis a point, that is and can be represented only insofar as innumerable [representational] sequences point back to it, viz. as their common presupposition\n\n or anchor (SW VI: 168).  It is merely a notional\npoint of reference, a common node of all representational series (SW\nVI: 168).\nThis analysis brings into focus the relation of soul to ego. Recall\nthe metaphysical axiom, that the soul is a simple\nwhole\u2014originally not representing\u2014whose\nself-preservations against various disturbances result in\n\u201crepresentings\u201d. The soul in itself, in its\nsimple and thus unknowable quality as not representing soul,\ncannot become either subject or object of consciousness. But the\nsoul with respect to all of its representations is the true\nsubject: the one, undivided, yet most variously active subject of all\nconsciousness.  Now as we consider psychic activity to\nbe generally a representing over against a\nrepresented, there arises the peculiar case where the\nrepresented entity is identical with itself (SW VI: 190\u20131). The\nsoul \u201cunfold[s] the represented world; and, in the middle of the\nworld, the represented, own self\u201d (SW VI: 191).\nThis represented self, then, is the ego, the apperceptive\nsystem of the soul\u2019s perturbations. As we will see in the final\nsection on Herbart\u2019s pedagogy, education just amounts to the\nbest development of this ego, i.e., its virtuous character. This\neducation (Ausbildung) culminates in science, by which\nHerbart means the soul\u2019s self-knowledge in terms of his\npsychology. For this \u201cscience speaks of the soul\nas the ground of the represented world and of its own\nSelf\u201d. Thus, while Herbart\u2019s language of a culminating,\nreflective science of the self may remind one of an Idealistic\nabsolute science, he takes great pains to distance his notion of\nscience from speculative or intuitionistic\nmetaphysics. Yes, in \u201cscience\u201d, the knower is the\nsoul, and \u201cknowing and known are one and the same, viz. the soul\nin the system of its self-preservations\u201d; however, he adds,\n\u201cI know of myself, not with innate, but with a\npermanently acquired knowledge\u201d (SW VI: 191).\n4. Aesthetics & ethics\n4.1 Aesthetics\nWhereas metaphysics and psychology deal with the real, aesthetics\nconcerns just those concepts \u201cthat solely indicate a value or\ndisvalue\u201d (Weiss 1928: 108; cf. SW XI: 24; 26). Aesthetics is\nthus a science of values. In particular, aesthetics inquires\ninto the beautiful, which is not a cognitive concept, i.e., no\npredicate of beings insofar as they exist. Rather the beautiful\n\u201cdenotes the way \u2026 an object is apprehended by an\nobserver\u2026\u201d (SW IV: 500; cf. Weiss 1928: 109).\nBeauty lies in the eye of the beholder, and is\nan experience of the subject. At the same time, the beautiful\nis not something merely subjective like a feeling of pleasantness, for\nit arises and subsists in the observer only with respect to an\nobject (cf. SW IV: 602). What the aesthetic conception articulates\nabout the object does not \u201cdepend on any individuality, but\nrather solely on the quality of the represented [object]\u201d (SW\nVI: 273). Suppose I declare: \u201cRembrandt\u2019s Aristotle\nwith a Bust of Homer is beautiful\u201d. On the one hand, the\nbeauty of the painting is something that lies not in the\npainting, but in my, the beholder\u2019s experience of it. But the\npredicate, \u201cis beautiful\u201d, does not attach to my\nexperience, but to its object, the painting. I do not claim that my\nexperience is beautiful, but that the painting is. Nor am I merely\nsaying that it seems beautiful to me; rather, the\nclaim pertains to the painting itself, viz. that it is\nbeautiful.\n4.1.1 Aesthetic judgment\nFor Herbart, an aesthetic judgment is marked by the immediacy\nand involuntariness with which it is made. Such judgments are, in\nother words, independent of the personal preference of the subject,\nand are, in a sense, forced upon her. They are warranted by a\npeculiar, originary kind of evidence springing from the observation of\nthe object (SW X: 318). They are clear, without having been learned or\nproved, and stand forth as absolute and non-negotiable claims (SW IV:\n105; 47).  This absolute and self-evident character lets aesthetic\njudgments function as the principles of a science of\naesthetics.\n\nThey let aesthetic feeling be brought into the\nform of a judgment, let the beautiful be treated scientifically, and\nlet aesthetics become a science of principles. (Weiss 1928:\n109)\nSuch immediate, involuntary judgments arise upon the\n\u201ccomplete [or perfect] representation of the object [of the\njudgment]\u201d: \u201cthe beautiful is the effect of complete [or\nperfect] representation\u201d (Weiss 1928: 110). By \u201ccomplete\nrepresentation\u201d, Herbart means the kind that arises of itself in\nthe utterly non-partisan observer, moved by the object alone. A\nbeautiful object will necessarily find favor, an ugly object distaste,\nfor it appears clearly to one free \u201cof the disturbing pressures\nand demands of the will\u201d (SW III: 526). In short, aesthetic\njudgment depends on a contemplative state of ataraxic indifference or\nwill-less-ness (Willenlosigkeit) (cf. SW II: 335; Beiser\n2014: 126).\n4.1.2 Aesthetic validity and \u201cconscience\u201d\nThe aesthetic judgment is synthetic, connecting the theoretical\ncognition of the object with its evaluation. The former is the subject\nof the judgment, the latter its predicate (SW IX: 80; 329, n.*).\nHerbart does not, of course, regard such judgments as functions of\na power of judgment. Rather, judgments of taste are the\ninvoluntary effect of any perfect representation, \u201cprovided the\nlatter does not immediately disappear in the flux\u201d of psychic\nchange (SW II: 45). The aesthetic judgment seems to possess an\nabsolute validity. This might seem strange, given the subjectivity of\ntaste, but as we saw above, the neutral judge\u2019s judgment makes a\nclaim about the object (cf. Kant, Critique of Judgment,\n\u00a7\u00a72, 4).  But there is a further problem: if each aesthetic\njudgment pertains to a single and particular representation, how can\nit have universal validity? (Cf. esp. Beiser 2014: 129) On\nHerbart\u2019s view, it gains the \u201cappearance of an enduring,\nindeed eternal authority\u201d, thanks to a kind of \u201csubjective\nnecessity\u201d (SW II: 350). That is, although each new perfected\nrepresentation inevitably draws after it a new judgment, yet it is\nalso true that the same representation will always provoke the same\njudgment (SW II: 350). In other words, under identical subjective and\nobjective conditions, the same aesthetic judgment must recur,\nand this produces the appearance of eternal validity.\nNow, as one repeatedly passes aesthetic judgments and becomes aware\nof their peculiar validity, they come to exert \u201ca slow pressure\nupon the [individual], who calls it his\n\u2018conscience\u2019\u201d (SW I: 265). Only he who repeatedly\ngenerates aesthetic judgments in fact acquires such a\n\u201cconscience\u201d. We may take Herbart to be speaking here of a\nsense of artistic propriety characteristic of the connoisseur or the\ntrained musician. In musical practice, for example, one makes myriad\njudgments regarding the tempo, articulation, or dynamics. Over time,\nthese fuse into stable appercipient masses\u2014the musical\n\u201cconscience\u201d\u2014and music conflicting with them seems\n\u201cwrong\u201d and must be criticized. Such a Herbartian\nconscience is no kind of faculty of taste or judgment, but a facility\nacquired in accordance with the laws of concept formation.\n4.1.3 The beautiful\nMuch as Aristotle rejects Plato\u2019s unitary conception of the\nGood, Herbart emphasizes the particularity of the\nbeautiful. Aesthetics cannot and ought not try to abstract from\nindividual judgments of taste in order to discover \u201cthe\u201d\ncommon essence of the beautiful (or the ugly). This is because Herbart\nholds the original aesthetic judgments, in their\nabsoluteness, to be the principles of\naesthetics. \n\n[Their] evidence, \u2026 absoluteness, and \u2026 perfect\nrepresentation of the object as the indispensable preconditions of the\npossibility [of such judgments] exclude the possibility of any highest\naesthetic propositions [Grunds\u00e4tze] \u2026 to which a\nnumber of aesthetic judgments \u2026 should be subordinated. (SW IV:\n47)\nAlthough it is universally true of the aesthetic that the\nobject involuntarily pleases or repels, yet the objects of aesthetic\njudgment themselves cannot be reduced to a formula. If one abstracts\nfrom their particularity, one is left with \u201cno object containing\nsomething that an aesthetic judgment could determine\u201d.\nWhat is it in the object that elicits approval or\ndisapproval\u2014what lets an object be judged\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d? Beauty is a function of relations\n(Verh\u00e4ltnisse) or form, as in the \u201crelations in\nthe outline of a statue, in the characters of a drama, of tones in\nmusical chords\u201d (SW IX: 329; cf. SW IX: 313, SW II: 344). For\nthis reason, Herbart holds that only an object exhibiting internal\nstructure or a relation to other objects can have aesthetic\ninterest. An object without relations is \u201caesthetically\ninsignificant\u201d (Weiss 1928: 115). In music, no single tone can\nbe considered, in itself, beautiful or ugly, although single tones\nconstitute the intervals and chords that, as relations, elicit\naesthetic judgment (cf. SW II: 344).  Hence the axiom of all\naesthetics is this:\n\nAll simple aesthetic elements must themselves be\nrelations, viz., relations whose relata, considered in\nthemselves, have no aesthetic value. (SW III: 331)\n\n We now see better what it is that aesthetic\njudgments express approval or disapproval of, viz. relations that can\nbe grasped in a single representing act (Weiss 1928: 116).\n4.1.4 The task of aesthetics as a discipline\nThus aesthetics starts with the simplest formal determinations\nunderlying approbation or disapproval (Weiss 1928: 117). Its\ndisciplinary task is\n\n\nneither to define, nor demonstrate, nor deduce, nor even to\ndistinguish amongst types of art or argue about a given work of art.\nRather, it should reveal the simple relations that generate\napprobation or deprecation in case of a perfect representing. It\nshould make us conscious \u2026 of the specific approbation\nand of the specific disapproval that is originally proper to any\nparticular relationship whatsoever. (SW II: 345)\nThe concepts we use to think these elemental relations Herbart\ncalls \u201cparadigms or Ideas\u201d (Weiss 1928: 118). The\nexhaustive presentation of these elementary relations grounds\naesthetics as a science. Once they are in hand, it can survey all\npossible aesthetic relations, as in figured bass. Indeed, Herbart\nconsiders figured bass to be the only existing model of an aesthetic\nscience, for it \u201cdemands and receives an absolute judgment for\nits simple intervals, chords, and progressions, without proving or\nexplaining anything\u201d (SW II: 345).\nShould these universal aesthetic Ideas be organized in a general\naesthetics, they could then be applied in different material spheres,\ne.g., of color, tone, figure, but also, crucially, of relations of\nthe will. Such specific ramifications of the paradigms are called\n\u201ctechniques\u201d (Kunstlehren) or \u201cpractical\nsciences\u201d (SW IV: 47). The discipline dealing with the\nparadigmatic elements of approbation or disapprobation of relations of\nwill is practical philosophy, i.e., ethics, to which we now\nturn.\n4.2 Ethics\nAll evaluative judgments are aesthetic; they evaluate the\nrepresented relations in their object. Practical philosophy\nor ethics evaluates relations of the will. Therefore, ethical\njudgments are a kind of aesthetic judgment (cf. SW VII: 10; SW X: 309;\nBeiser 2014: 108; 125, ff.). Because such judgments often conflict,\nthe task of practical philosophy is not to pass judgment itself, but\nto cause us to judge correctly. Hence, all practical philosophy can\nand should do is to \u201ccorrectly present the object, [in such a\nway] as to be perfectly grasped\u201d, that object being relations of\nthe will (SW II: 334); thus, as figured bass presents a theory of\nbeautiful tonal relations, practical philosophy seeks the \u201cwhole\nset of relations by which the will becomes the object of\npraise or blame\u201d (SW IX: 329: n.*). Like Kant, Herbart holds\nthat the determining grounds of moral action must be found in a\npriori norms, and rejects eudemonism or any \u201cmaterial\nmotives\u201d as grounds for practical laws (cf. Beiser 2014: 94,\n125, ff.). For Herbart as for Kant, morally evaluative judgments are\nto be made solely with an eye to the \u201cform of the will\u201d,\nwhich ethics determines.\n4.2.1 The object of practical judgment\nPractical judgment judges the \u201cwill\u201d, a species of\ndesire marked by determinate cognition and fixing of its object, and\nby conviction that the object is attainable. While I might desire to\nleap tall buildings in a bound, I cannot will it (SW II: 99). Now the\nvalue of the will\u2019s object cannot determine its evaluation,\nsince Herbart like Kant excludes all material grounds as determinative\nof moral action. Hence the will itself is the object of\nevaluation\u2014but how? Because every instance of willing is\nnonetheless bound to its object, individual acts of willing\ncannot be the object of moral evaluation. Further, an act of willing\nisolated from its object also cannot be the object of moral\nevaluation, since\n\notherwise, the difference between a good and evil\nwill would disappear: willing and willing-well would be one and the\nsame. (Weiss 1928: 122)\nHerbart\u2019s solution to the dilemma is to say that practical\nphilosophy considers the will not in itself, but only insofar as it\nenters into relation with another\nwill.[68] It\nis these various possible relations among wills\nthat constitute the possible forms of the will, and that are judged\nfine or shameful by practical judgment (SW X: 348). In this way, the\naesthetic elements and paradigmatic Ideas of general aesthetics\ngovern practical philosophy, as well.\n4.2.2 The paradigms or Ideas of practical philosophy\nHerbart identifies five such elementary relations of will that\ndemand aesthetic approval, viz., the Ideas of inner freedom;\nperfection; benevolence; right; fairness/justice (SW II: 356). The\nfirst Idea is the Idea of Ideas, i.e., the general decision\nor determination of the will always \u201cto act in accordance with\nthe patterns as patterns, in accordance with taste in\ngeneral\u201d (SW II: 357). Unlike the other Ideas, inner freedom is\na paradigm that is unconditionally pleasing, and which therefore does\nnot need to be commanded. On the other hand, the will can easily come\ninto conflict with the other four paradigms, and such conflict\nis displeasing. The insight of practical judgment into the\nparadigmatic pleasing-ness of the Ideas therefore makes itself felt as\na demand to neutralize that conflict:\n\n[t]he ethical commandment springs solely out of\njudgments of displeasure, and appears when, and for as long as, a\nwilling conflicts with the practical Idea.\n4.2.3 The virtuous human being\nHerbart\u2019s Doctrine of Ideas naturally leads to the notion of\nvirtue or human excellence, for \u201cthe ideal, complete realization\nof inner freedom [just] is the virtue of the\nindividual\u201d (Weiss 1928: 145; cf. SW II: 409, ff.,\nesp. 411\u201312). Here we advance from aesthetic pleasure in the\nparadigms of the will to their actual realization: \u201cVirtue does\nnot forever stay home but strides forth into an alien world\u201d (SW\nII: 414). Thus the individual who sees and approves of the practical\nIdeas also feels compelled to enact them in a coherent way of\nlife. This unity is the Ideal of virtue, according to which\n\u201cno part of [practical] insight may lack the corresponding\nwill[,] and there should be no lack of connection among its\nparts\u201d (SW II: 412). The virtuous life must exclude vice and\nlack of virtue, and react to the situations that at every turn demand\nvirtue\u2019s activity (SW II: 412\u201313).\nInstead of an indefinitely ramifying list of duties to achieve this\nideal, Herbart proposes that the sense of art or Kunstsinn\ncan help us gain an overview of virtue (SW II: 415). That is,\nlife\u2019s circumstances appear as a matter to be formed, and the\nvirtuous person is able to judge the finest way in which a\nsituation should be handled (SW II: 416). But because the artistic\nsense is in constant conflict with external forces and internal\nfeelings, it must be continually rekindled (SW II: 417). Hence, the\nIdeal of virtue can be at best asymptotically approached and it is\nthis approach that Herbart calls \u201cmorality\u201d. Since an\napproach implies a temporal sequence, human life may be understood as\na chain of ethical actions and passions (SW II: 417, f.).\nHerbart analyzes this chain into three main parts. First, there is\nvirtue as \u201cthe picture of a beautiful reality\u201d, belonging\nto imagination, dream, and fantasy, in which the need for intervening\nin reality is lacking: the Ideas are simply assumed as universally\neffective (SW II: 417\u201318). Second, the need to act arises, and\nthe striving will encounters obstacles even within the sphere of\nthought.  Finally, we really act, and try to realize the beautiful\nworld of thought (SW II: 418). While social reality hampers the\nachievement of virtue, the individual, conscious of his inner freedom,\nmust try to find all possible avenues towards moral fulfillment (Weiss\n1928: 156).  It is in preparing the individual for a life of moral\naction that education is required.\n5. Pedagogy\nHerbart writes:\nThe sole and entire task of education\n[Erziehung] is encompassed by the concept,\n\u201cmorality\u201d [Moralit\u00e4t]. (SW I: 259)\n\n If virtue is the realization of human freedom,\nthen the goal of Herbartian education is to make the\nchild capable of living virtuously, viz., by forming the\npupil\u2019s character. For reasons that will become clearer below,\nHerbart identifies moral character with a \u201cmany-sided\u201d\ncharacter. Many-sidedness is a regulative ideal guiding one\u2019s\nstriving towards full individuality: the teacher helps the pupil\ndevelop all his[69]\n unique talents and interests as far and as\ncoherently as possible. That is, the teacher helps the pupil\nsystematically connect his interests around the central principle\nthat is his\n self.[70]\n5.1 Many-sidedness and \u201cinterest\u201d\nInstruction aiming at many-sidedness has two main phases,\n\u201cengrossment\u201d (Vertiefung) and\n\u201creflection\u201d (Besinnung), each of which in turn\nhas a \u201cresting\u201d and a \u201cprogressive\u201d moment:\nresting engrossment is \u201cclarity\u201d; progressive engrossment\nis \u201cassociation\u201d; resting reflection is\n\u201csystem\u201d; progressive reflection is \u201cmethod\u201d\n(SW II: 38, ff.; cf. esp. Gl\u00f6ckner 1892; Beiser 2014:\n106\u20137). It is important to note that these phases of learning\nrecapitulate the process of apperception. That is, clarity occurs\nwhen a representation or representational series comes into full\nconsciousness, where it hovers in the full light of attention. One is\nengrossed in it, which is simply to say, one is not aware\nof anything else. But of course the child\u2019s mind rarely stays\noccupied with a single representation for long; its imagination\n(Phantasie) rapidly leads it, usually by association, to\nother, similar representations (SW II: 40).  This spontaneity of\nabsorption in environing objects is the source of a natural\nmany-sidedness, and thus the seed of the fully formed personality. While the phases of engrossment are natural to all human\nbeings, it is obvious that in themselves they have no direction or\norganizing \n principle.[71]\nThe teacher does not simply give the principle to the\nchild. Rather, his instruction aims to bring the child by stages to\nrecognize the principle on and as its own, by reflecting on\nits immediate experience. The child\u2019s maturity determines the\nscope of reflection, but she will always fall short of the full\nself-reflection characteristic of the adult. Since many-sidedness\ndepends on reflection for its full solidity, the child can also only\never approximate adult versatility and virtue (PS I: 149). For\nHerbart, the teacher promotes reflection by promoting what he calls\nthe child\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d (Interesse). Now,\nthe child\u2019s natural engrossment in its activities must be\nrespected as symbols of its individuality. At the same time,\nengrossment is a kind of seclusion, whereas interest is an opening up\nof the person in and to the \nworld.[72]\n Step by step, the teacher must lead the\npupil to become an interested, active learner, who desires not to\npossess knowledge, but to hover \u201cbetween merely\nspectating [on the one hand] and grasping [on the other]\u201d\n(cf. SW II: 42).\nThe first phase of interest is noticing objects:\n\nthe noticed object not only stands forth for a\ncertain duration from the flow of psychic activity, but also aids the\nreproduction of suppressed representations. (Weiss 1928: 194; cf. SW\nII: 42; 53)\n\n As other representations rise, new, imagined\nrepresentations are anticipated (as we saw frequently happens in\napperception). Should an imagined representation be perfectly\nrepresented, it will naturally provoke an aesthetic judgment of\napproval. This leads to a \u201cdemand\u201d for the imagined\nobject, i.e., an overpowering sense for its realization; and this\ndemand finally expresses itself in action in the world (SW II:\n42\u20133). It is thus clear that by \u201ccultivating\ninterest\u201d, Herbart does not mean simply getting the pupil\n\u201cto be interested in something\u201d. Rather, as these four\nphases of interest map onto the phases of engrossment and reflection,\ninterest is an expression of many-sidedness, namely its activity in\nthe world. For \u201cdemand\u201d here is not simply a strong\ndesire, but an apperceptive \u201cmental anticipation\u201d of the\nobject\u2019s realization. As such it is necessary for the pupil to\nadvance to a more perfect state of systematic and aesthetic\ncompleteness.[73]\n Thus by promoting interest and\nmany-sidedness, education primes the pupil for action (PS:\n181).[74]\nThus far, \u201cinterest\u201d has remained quite abstract: it\nis, in nuce, a questing openness towards certain objects,\nleading to action. Now the kind of action Herbart has in mind is not\nan instinctive reaction, but is integrated into a systematic plan. For\nthe totality of \u201cthe interesting\u201d is prescribed by\nculture,[75]\nand its divisions into the cultural and natural sciences (SW II: 44,\nf.).  Education must accordingly pursue in parallel the formation of\nthe pupil\u2019s imagination and understanding (PS I: 59; cf. 181).\nBecause all knowledge is rooted in experience, organized through\nspeculation, and grasped as a whole aesthetically, Bildung\nmust develop these three dimensions equally (SW II: 53). Equally\nimportant, however, is the pupil\u2019s constant, active\nparticipation in his surroundings, in order to develop an empathic\nunderstanding of her fellow human beings (PS I: 156; SW II: 51,\nff.). In all these cases, a teacher is needed to modify experience and\nhuman interaction in order to maximize the yield of knowledge. For\nexperience merely accumulates random representations;\ninstruction helps the person to analyze, organize and combine\nthese \u201cformless fragments\u201d (Weiss 1928:\n 200).[76]\n By the same token,\nmere everyday contact with others does not produce empathy.\nHence, the teacher must not be narrowly committed to his scientific\nexpertise, but demonstrate interest in the world and human beings (SW\nII: 50). While native taste and thoughtfulness cannot be taught, the\nteacher must be alert to these and fan such sparks in order\nto complete what nature has prepared (SW II: 46). Further, he\nmust respect the \u201cpersonal unity\u201d of the child:\nHerbart\u2019s rule:\n\nto give equal right to engrossment and reflection\nin every in area of inquiry, no matter how small; i.e., to tend in\norder to: clarity of the particular; association of\nthe many; coordination of what has been associated, as well\nas practice in progressing through this organization.\n\n In all this, the elements of\ninstruction\u2014\u201cfacts, information, ideas,\nknowledge\u201d\u2014are not negligible, but rather\n\nvitally important, for \u2026 they become built\nup into \u201capperception masses\u201d, which, in the process of\ntaking in more facts, information, ideas, knowledge, give\nrise to \u201capperceptive interest\u201d, this latter being itself\nof first importance in the character-forming process. (Hayward 1907:\n70)\n5.2 Character\nWe have so far been discussing the ideal of the many-sidedness; the\nmany-sided person and the person of character is one and the same,\nthough regarded from different perspectives (PS I: 199; SW II: 89; cf.\nSW IV, esp. \u201cP\u00e4dagogisches Gutachten usw.\u201d:\n519, ff). Herbart is particularly concerned with moral\ncharacter, and its virtues of stability, hardness\n(H\u00e4rte), and invulnerability. He wants to show that a\nmany-sided interest serves moral character, and how pedagogy devoted\nto the former contributes to moral education (Weiss 1928: 211). For\nHerbart, (moral) character, like all spiritual (geistig)\naspects of human life, is not a natural given, but a gradual\nacquisition. Psychologically speaking, it is the will that in the\nyoung child is stamped through repeated interaction with the outer\nworld, settling into \u201cuniform and stable [ways] in which [it\npursues] certain goals while excluding others\u201d; thus, the will\nbecomes character (Weiss 1928: 211; cf. SW II: 90).\nCharacter has distinct objective and subjective sides (SW II:\n90\u20131).  Objectively, character depends on the child\u2019s\nsusceptibility to formation and its individuality. Although the child\nis not born with \u201ca\u201d character (which term is reserved for\nsettled traits), yet he is born with certain dispositions, including a\n\u201cdisposition to stability of character\u201d (SW II: 91). This\nmanifests itself in what Herbart calls the will\u2019s\n\u201cmemory\u201d, i.e., the fact that under like stimuli, the will\nwill will like actions (SW II: 91\u20132). In this respect, there\nseems to be something predictable, hence \u201cobjective\u201d in\nhuman character. Although this stability is but relative, and one\nspontaneously finds himself choosing or forsaking, avoiding this or\npursuing that, yet\n\n\nwhere there is a memory of the will, the choice [in a given situation]\nwill be made of itself. The preponderance of wishes will involuntarily\norganize itself [and manifests itself in] choice. (SW II: 92; SW\nV: 203)\nIn different individuals, their inclinations and naturally\ndiffering intensity will cause the stability of simple willing to\nvary: \u201cevery individuality is and remains a chameleon\u201d (SW\nII: 93). Nonetheless, they originate in a \u201cunified source and\npoint of reference\u201d that constitutes the \u201cessential core\nof individuality\u201d (Weiss 1928: 213). Hence while choice only\noccurs in accordance with an individual, particular standard, it\nremains the precondition for the consolidation of character itself. It\nis out of simple willing and the psychological character to which it\ngradually gives rise that the \u201cmatter\u201d is gathered, as it\nwere, with which one has to work, and from which he ultimately\n\u201cmust secure the demands that he makes of himself\u201d:\n\u201cBeing is what gets a person started; demands follow\nafter\u201d (PS I: 198).\nOn the other hand, these demands typify the higher, subjective\naspect of character, \u201chigher\u201d because marked by reflective\nintelligence, an apperceptive distinction between willing and the\nobjects of will, between I and not-I. Thus the ego now identifies the\nnatural or simple will as its \u201cown\u201d will: the natural\nstability of the simple will becomes a willed or conscious stability.\nIn addition, the reflective effort to grasp oneself leads to\na demand regarding the objects towards\nwhich conscious willing is directed. That is, the will must\nadapt itself to changes in the object: it perceives a demand\nthat one must \u201cprecisely orient oneself in view of\ncircumstances\u201d, and to do so differently as circumstances\nshift. Hence the stability of character must be tempered with\nflexibility (Motivit\u00e4t); in the \u201cprecision of this\nflexibility lies the art of characterful living\u201d (PS I:\n201; 351, f.; cf. esp. 198).  Individual willing settles into\ncharacter through the struggle that arises in the individual\u2019s\nattempt to defend the ego and the will\u2019s stability. Because the\nstability of character is only relative, and shifts over the years,\nits true principle can only consist in being oriented towards\na realm of purposes (Zwecke) or ultimate values\n(Werte) (Weiss 1928: 216).\n5.3 Ethical aspect of character\n\nTo bring it about that the pupil finds himself, as\nchoosing the good, as rejecting the evil: this\u2014or\nnothing\u2014is character-formation! (SW I: 261)\n\n Character has an ineluctably ethical aspect: we\nwant (our) character not to be of just any sort, but good. Like\nAristotle, Herbart holds that we always stand in some relation to virtue\nand vice. While not by nature good or bad, our actions and character\nnecessarily fall somewhere on the spectrum of virtue and vice. Virtue\nis thus not something attached from the outside to an ethically\nneutral self; rather, it is a natural quality of man that will develop\nwell or poorly. So Herbart, like Aristotle and Plato, does not think\nthat education should aim to inculcate moral truths or commandments,\nso much as lead the \u201cmoral[ly constituted human being]\nto recognize his own value and dignity, and [then] to elevate\nit\u201d (PS I: 199). Here again we see the transition from the\nobjective facticity of one\u2019s constitution as a being\nwith some moral charge, to the subjective endorsement of it,\nof accepting responsibility for the excellence of one\u2019s moral\nconstitution as the source of one\u2019s value and dignity. It is a\nmovement of \u201cawakening self-reflection\u201d, in which the\nform-law governing our involuntary (aesthetic) approval or disapproval\nof human actions or situations is elevated to norm-law, i.e., is\naccepted as binding on me, and to which I have a responsibility that I\naccept (cf. Weiss 1928: 216).\nAs with character generally, moral character displays a kind of\nnatural memory, a \u201cperduring in simple willing [,] the natural\nbeginning of unity and consistency of moral willing\u201d, already\nevident in the small child\u2019s incipient moral feeling (PS I: 199;\ncf. SW II: 120\u20131). All this points to the fact that in the\nobjective or natural constitution of character, we already find\n\u201cconceptions of the good and right\u201d. This natural moral\nmemory shows itself in the fact that\n\nmoral judgment as the pure natural appearance of\nthe essence of humanity is not \u201cobscure\u201d and\n\u201cmutable\u201d, but [always] \u201cdecisive\u201d, that it\nalways appears as the same willing whenever the same stimulus is\nrenewed and nothing hinders or neutralizes a pure conception of the\nobject, [i.e.,] whenever the mind is in a state of pure\ncontemplation. (Weiss 1928: 217; cf. esp. PS I: 131)\nThis consistent, disinterested willing just is the phenomenon of\nconscience, which thus reveals itself as a form of willing, namely the\nnatural desire for the good as neutrally judged. As will, conscience,\ntoo, has an object, namely the moral ideal, i.e., its own relation to\nother wills. As we saw in our discussion of Herbart\u2019s ethics,\n\n[t]he judged [thing, sc. judged by\n\u201cconscience\u201d] is also [the] will, [only in this case] the\nwill in its relation to other wills (PS I: 202)\n\n Conscience as \u201cnatural\u201d or\n\u201cobjective\u201d will thus articulates the (moral) demands\nthat the human being makes of himself, the pursuit of which\ndetermines his moral character, now properly so\ncalled. Self-reflection at first notices objective as well as\nsubjective willing, but when the object has been completely\nrepresented, viz., the individual will as a member\nor relatum of a will-relation, then this complete\nrepresentation of the object also provokes approval or disapproval as an immediate\n\u201caesthetic\u201d effect . In other\nwords, the individual goes beyond merely registering how he feels or\nfinds himself, to positively approving or censuring that same inner\nstate.\nWe see here a special case of apperception as an interaction among\nconflicting representational masses, in which one representational\ngroup is not only \u201cnoticed\u201d but evaluated by another, held\nto what (from its perspective) is perceived as an alien claim. Now, on\nthe one hand, since the soul is postulated as a unity, the difference\nbetween how one is, and how one judges that one ought to\nbe, indicates an inner conflict. On the other hand, the moral\npersonality, as a manifestation of the integral soul, must or ought\nalso to be integrated. In short, the conflict must be resolved so that\nthe judged will is brought into agreement with the aesthetic\n(apperceiving, evaluating) will, and so \u201cmerge into a single\nperson\u201d: \u201c[T]his person represents the ideal of an\nethically self-determining will\u201d (PS I: 202; cf. 131). But since\nthis ideal is rarely if ever achieved, we constantly feel compelled to\n\u201cinterrupt our activity and alter our mental disposition from\nwithin\u201d. Thus, for the sake of the unity of the moral\npersonality, the human takes as a categorical imperative what\npreviously was but an aesthetic judgment.\nNow it is a presupposition of pedagogy that all human beings are\ncapable of living up to the ideal of an integrated, unified,\nautonomous personality (PS I: 202; 93). But how does the will become\ndecisive? In other words, how do we gain a moral character\nthat acts for the good? We may approach this problem by\nasking how those natures that successfully form themselves do so, and\nthrough what stages they must pass in \u201cgaining a\ncharacter\u201d (Weiss 1928: 221\u20132). This can help the\npedagogue develop a plan for optimizing what is otherwise a haphazard\nprocess. The resolute character depends, first, upon a\nmoral eros, and striving towards a representation. The will\ngenerates the act out of a desire (PS I: 360). But active deeds in\nturn depend on natural disposition\u2014including bodily health; the\nwill\u2019s memory; and the spirit\u2019s mobility or\n\u201cflexibility\u201d (PS I: 365). The less motile the spirit,\nthe firmer the will (PS I: 365;\n198).[77] Now\nnatural disposition develops very slowly and only fully matures in\nadults when they enter the world. Hence character-education has\nlittle latitude, since children rarely are placed in situations of\ntrue responsibility. At just the moment when the young adult takes up\nresponsibilities, his receptivity for education is exhausted (SW II:\n88, f.; PS I: 364).\nHerbart draws two conclusions: First, that character-formation must\nfocus on the young person\u2019s \u201csphere of desire\n[Begehrungskreis]\u201d, as the one aspect of character\napparently susceptible to \u201ca lasting influence\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 224). And since desires aim at goals, and goals are\nrepresentations, the educator can set to work upon the \u201csphere\nof representations\u201d, and thus shape the ultimate targets for the\nmature individual\u2019s future desire (SW II: 118, f.). Second,\nHerbart concludes that character-development gains stability and\nsecurity by being accelerated and integrated into the actual period\nand process of education. The teacher must keep in mind that character\n\u201cis solely formed through action out of one\u2019s own\nwill\u201d (PS I: 251). Therefore, Herbart\u2019s pedagogy\nemphasizes the importance of offering the child\u2019s will ample\nopportunity to express itself: \u201cBoys and youths must\nbe dared to become men\u201d (\u201cMa\u00dfregeln der\nKinderregierung\u201d; Herbart 1887b: 17). It is the work itself\nthat fixes the bounds of thought and action, not the teacher; within\nthose bounds the student is to be given maximal freedom (PS I:\n308). By frequently exercising the freedom of the will in purposeful\nactivity, the pedagogue is able to \u201charden\u201d the\npupil\u2019s will (PS I: 368\u20139).\nWe began by asking how moral character is to be formed. This\nquestion finally calls for consideration of the \u201cinfluences\nthat specially affect the moral features of character\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 225). Chief among these is aesthetic judgment, which must\ntherefore be constantly exercised, so as to become the power\nmastering desires. The pedagogue must therefore carefully attend to\nthe contents of the child\u2019s or sphere of thoughts. First, the\npupil should gain a clear and particularized familiarity with a\n\u201cwhole series of moral elements and their most common causes in\nlife\u201d, e.g., the main relationships of daily life, family,\ncountry, and their various conflicts and contradictions. Further,\nsince character ultimately depends on the integration of the person,\nall domains of human interest must be brought into relation with the\nideal: thus, for Herbart as for\nMontaigne,[78]\n history in the broadest sense provides an\nindispensable space in which to exercise the young person\u2019s\naesthetic and practical judgment. Since passive presentation of\nhistorical, literary, or philosophical pictures must be\navoided, the instructor must strive to bring peoples and persons of\nthe past to the fore as living people: practice in\nrecognizing many human types sharpens the pupil\u2019s\n\u201cethical eye\u201d, securing the child from dangerous\nsurprises in life (SW II: 50). Again, because historical figures\nappear at a distance, the pupil can contemplate them in a\ndisinterested fashion, letting \u201cpure taste\u201d rule action\nin his imagination. Such training is the best one can do in preparing\nthe person for adulthood.",
