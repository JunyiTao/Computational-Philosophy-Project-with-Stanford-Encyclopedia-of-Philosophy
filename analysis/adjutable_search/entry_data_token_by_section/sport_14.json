The study of aesthetics and sport has focused on two principal\nareas. The first concerns the relevance of aesthetic qualities to the\nexperience of playing and watching sport. Does sport elicit aesthetic\nvalues?  If so, what are these values and are they inherent to or only\nincidental to sport?  The second examines the relationship between\nsport and art. Is sport one of the arts? If so, what makes sport an\nart? An early precursor of these discussions is C. L. R. James\u2019\n(1963) classic, Beyond a Boundary. In his seminal analysis of\ncricket, James explores the identity between sport and art, arguing\nthat both yield aesthetic pleasure because they have been created to\nbe beautiful.\n\n\nRelated to both of these concerns is whether the aesthetic\nappreciation of sport is distinctive, that is, different in kind to\nother forms of aesthetic appreciation. For Joseph Kupfer (1975), sport\nhas multiple purposes. One of these purposes is to create aesthetically\npleasant experiences. Stephen Mumford (2011) observes that the\naesthetic values elicited by sports depend on the physical demands that\neach sport makes of participants. However, in Mumford\u2019s view, all\nsports yield aesthetic experiences related to bodily motion and grace,\nhigh-level abstract forms, drama, and innovation and genius. Edgar\n(2012, 2013a) criticizes this view as narrow because it connects sport\nonly to values related to harmony, neglecting the fact that sport is\nalso ugly. Since sport yields aesthetic pleasure, James (1963) argues\nthat sport should be seen as one of the arts. More recently, Spencer K.\nWertz (1985; 1985), Hans Ulrich Gumbretch (2006), and Wolfgang Welsch\n(1999) have supported the idea that sport has aesthetic qualities and\nthat sport should be regarded as an art. However, some have denied\nsport\u2019s artistic credentials.\n\n\nEliseo Vivas (1959, p. 228) contends that, unlike aesthetic\nexperiences, sport cannot be experienced disinterestedly. To do so, one\nmust bracket an essential feature of sport: competition. For Maureen\nKovich (1971), if athletes and spectators focused on the aesthetic\naspects of sport, their preoccupation would be the observation and\ncreation of art in movement rather than on scoring and winning. The\nmain purpose of sport is to meet physical challenges and to compare\noneself to others in doing so. For instance, in the high jump, the goal\nis to clear the bar by jumping over it. Athletes compete to see who can\njump the highest, not the most beautifully. Dick Fosbury introduced the\n\u2018flop\u2019 not because it was more beautiful than previous\ntechniques (i.e., scissors, western roll, and straddle jump), but\nbecause it was more effective (2007). To ignore the essential\ncompetitive elements of sport in favor of aesthetic principles is to\nfail to take sport seriously. To strengthen this claim, Paul Ziff\n(1974) argues that some sporting events have little or no aesthetic\nvalue. Often, athletes play dirty and achieve ugly victories. In\nsupport of this view, David Best (1974, 1985) argues that most athletes\nprefer an ugly victory than a defeat where they have performed\ngracefully. On this view, not only is aesthetics inessential to sport,\nbut the pursuit of aesthetic purposes can undermine the achievement of\nsport\u2019s main goals. Thus, Ray Elliot (1974) posits that the\ngoddess of sport is not Beauty but Victory. Creating beauty should\nnever be the main goal of sport. Aesthetics is incidental in sport,\nwhereas, in art, it is the principal aim. Therefore, sport is not an\nart.\n\n\nA further challenge to the idea that sport can be art is that art\nconcerns something beyond itself, whereas sport concerns play and\nnothing in real life beyond play. For instance, an actor playing Hamlet\nis not Hamlet in real life. They represent the modern\nindividual\u2019s existential struggle. By contrast, a point guard in\nbasketball is actually a point guard; point guards do not represent\nanything outside the game of basketball. In response, Kevin Krein\n(2008) and Tim L. Elcombe (2012) have argued that, like art, sports\nconvey values and meanings external to sport that represent, or present\nan alternative to (in the case of non-traditional sports such as\nclimbing and surfing), the culture in which sport practitioners find\nthemselves. In Terrence J. Roberts\u2019 (1995) view, athletes are\n\u2018strong poets.\u2019 They expresses something about our life\nsituation as embodied agents (Mumford, 2014). Drawing on Nelson Goodman\n(1978), philosophers such as Edgar, Breivik, and Krein understand sport\nas worldmaking, that is, sport embraces and refigures symbolic worlds\noutside of sport, opening up new ways of describing, or making, such\nnon-sporting worlds. Sport provides resources for re-describing the\nnon-sporting world. Building upon this view of sport, Edgar (2013a)\nargues for a shift from sport aesthetics to sport hermeneutics, that\nis, to the interpretation of the meaning of sport and how that meaning\nis interpreted (see Lopez Frias & Edgar, 2016). \n",
