    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy and its Subject Matter\n1. Moral Philosophy and its Subject Matter\n\nHume and Kant operate with two somewhat different conceptions of\nmorality itself, which helps explain some of the differences\nbetween their respective approaches to moral philosophy. The\nmost important difference is that Kant sees law, duty, and obligation\nas the very heart of morality, while Hume does not. In this respect,\nKant\u2019s conception of morality resembles what Bernard Williams\ncalls \u201cthe moral system\u201d, which defines the domain of\nmorality primarily in terms of an unconditionally binding and\ninescapable form of obligation (Williams 1985: 193\u201394). Kant\nbelieves that our moral concerns are dominated by the question of what\nduties are imposed on us by a law that commands with a uniquely moral\nnecessity. Like most eighteenth-century philosophers, he also believes\nthat our moral lives are preoccupied with the question of how to be\nvirtuous over a lifetime, but he defines virtue in terms of the more\nfundamental concepts of law, obligation, and duty. By contrast, these\nconcepts play a role in Hume\u2019s understanding, but they are far less\ncentral. For Hume, the broader and somewhat looser notion of\n\u201cpersonal merit\u201d lies at the heart of morality (EPM\n9.1.1). Our moral concerns are dominated by the question of which\nmotives are virtuous, and we answer this question by looking to the\nresponses of our fellow human beings, who\u2014when viewing things\nproperly\u2014approve of those motives and character traits that are\nuseful or immediately agreeable (EPM 9.1.13). These are the terms that\ncharacterize duty and obligation for Hume, rather than the other way\naround.\n\nTwo other differences are important to note. First, Kant draws a\nbright line between moral and non-moral phenomena, such as prudence,\npolitics, or aesthetics. Morality\u2019s normative standards and the\nnature of its demands distinguish it sharply from the non-moral. For\nHume, the line between the moral and non-moral is far blurrier. He\nfrequently assimilates moral judgment to \u201ctaste\u201d or\njudgments about beauty and deformity (Gill 2007), and he explicitly\nargues against the strict separation of moral virtues from other\npersonal qualities such as a quick wit or even good looks (T\n3.3.4\u20135). According to Hume, the strict separation of moral and\nnon-moral virtues marks one way in which modern moral thought is\ninferior to ancient ethics. He also seems to suspect that it reflects\nan unhealthy fixation on responsibility and guilt inherited from\nChristianity (Darwall 2013: 8\u20139).\n\nA second important difference is closely related to the first. For\nKant the moral is distinguished from the non-moral not only by a\nspecial form of obligation but also by its elevation above the rest of\nlife. Morality itself has a unique status or \u201cdignity\u201d, as\ndoes the rational being from whose autonomous will the law springs (G\n4:435). The proper response to both is a correspondingly unique form\nof reverence or \u201crespect\u201d, which morality demands equally\nfrom each of us. Kant believes that in the moral domain we take\nourselves\u2014often only implicitly\u2014to be\n\u201cpersons\u201d, elevated above mere \u201cthings\u201d such\nas machines or other animals. One of our chief moral concerns is to\nprotect this status, which requires respecting the rational autonomy\nat its source and avoiding behavior or patterns of thought and desire\nthat dishonor or degrade persons by treating ourselves or others as\nmere things. This concern looms large in Kant\u2019s conception of\nmorality, and it has a profound influence on his approach to moral\nphilosophy (Anderson 2008). We see it, for example, in his discussions\nof respect for persons and his characterization of ethical virtue as\n\u201clove of honor\u201d (cf. Denis 2014). We see it also in the\npriority given to duties to self (cf. Denis 2010a), as well as\nKant\u2019s claim that a person throws herself away and makes herself\nan object of \u201ccontempt\u201d when she lies to herself or\ngrovels before others, for example (MM 6:420). Hume does not see\nthings this way. For Hume, the domain of morality is not particularly\npure, special, or elevated. It sometimes shows us at our most\nbenevolent or most magnanimous, but morality is continuous with the\nrest of life, including politics and the pursuit of wealth and status\nin modern commercial society. Moral virtue is undoubtedly pleasing to\nus, sometimes powerfully so, but it does not command a unique\nform of respect or reverence. Neither do the rules and ideals of\nmorality, which spring from the same propensities, ideas, and passions\nthat drive the rest of human behavior. Notions of honor and dignity\nmay figure into Hume\u2019s view of morality but they are far from\ncentral. Morality has us far more concerned with promoting pleasure\nand utility.\n\nHume and Kant both believe that philosophy should offer a theory of\nmorality\u2019s foundation. When it comes to morality\u2019s foundation,\nthey seem to agree on two things. First, morality\u2019s foundation\ncannot be found in religion. Second, it cannot be found in\nmind-independent facts about the world. Yet they disagree about the\nrest of the story. Hume locates the foundation of morality in human\nnature, primarily in our emotional responses to the behavior of our\nfellow human beings. By contrast, Kant locates the foundation of\nmorality in the rational nature that we share with all possible finite\nrational beings. He argues that morality\u2019s foundation lies in\nthe \u201cautonomy\u201d of the rational will. Kant\u2019s notion\nof autonomy is one of the more central, distinctive, and influential\naspects of his ethics. He defines autonomy as \u201cthe property of\nthe will by which it is a law to itself (independently of any property\nof the objects of volition)\u201d (G 4:440). According to Kant, the\nwill of a moral agent is autonomous in that it both gives itself the\nmoral law (is self-legislating) and can constrain or motivate itself\nto follow the law (is self-constraining or self-motivating). The\nsource of the moral law is not in the agent\u2019s feelings or\ninclinations, but in her \u201cpure\u201d rational will, which Kant\nidentifies as the \u201cproper self\u201d (G 4:461). A heteronomous\nwill, on the other hand, is governed by something other than itself,\nsuch as an external force or authority.\n\nThese rival conceptions of morality and its foundation correspond to\ntwo very different approaches to moral philosophy. Hume\u2019s\napproach could be called naturalistic, empirical, or experimental. His\nmoral philosophy is part of his larger endeavor to provide a\nnaturalistic explanation of human nature as a whole. Hume\u2019s\napproach relies on and reflects his philosophy of mind, which is\nempirical in its approach. He treats ethics, together with psychology,\nhistory, aesthetics, and politics, as the subject of his \u201cmoral\nscience\u201d. Hume often seems more interested in explaining\nmorality as a natural phenomenon than in setting out a normative\nethical theory, treating moral action as part of the same physical\nworld in which we explain things in terms of cause and effect (EHU\n8.1.20\u201322). On this view, everything we do is open to empirical\ninvestigation and explanation. In fact, Hume often compares humans\nwith other animals, tracing the bases of human morality to features of\nthe mind that human beings and other animals have in common (T\n2.1.12).\n\nIn sharp contrast with Hume, Kant insists on the need for an a\npriori investigation of morality\u2019s foundation. His detailed\ntreatment of virtue and moral judgment draws heavily on observations\nand ideas about human nature. But Kant makes explicit that morality\nmust be based on a supreme moral principle, which can only be\ndiscovered a priori, through a method of pure moral\nphilosophy (G 4:387\u201392). By \u201cpure\u201d or a\npriori moral philosophy, Kant has in mind a philosophy grounded\nexclusively on principles that are inherent in and revealed through\nthe operations of reason. According to Kant, the a priori\napproach is required because morality\u2019s commands are\nunconditional. We could never discover a principle that commands all\nrational beings with such absolute authority through Hume\u2019s method. An\nempirical approach, he argues, can tell us how people do act, but it\ncannot tell us how we ought to act. Once equipped with the supreme\nprinciple of morality, however, one still requires an understanding of\nhuman beings in order to apply it (MM 6:217). This is important for\nKant. One can say little about what the supreme moral principle\nrequires in concreto without knowing such things as the sorts\nof ends people may be inclined to adopt and the conditions under which\nhuman agency will characteristically thrive or wither. As noted below\nand throughout, this is one area of Kant\u2019s moral thinking that was\nsignificantly influenced by Hume and his fellow sentimentalists.\n",
