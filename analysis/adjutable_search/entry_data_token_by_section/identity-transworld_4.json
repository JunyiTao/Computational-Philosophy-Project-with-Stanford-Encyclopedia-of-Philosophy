Loux 1979, Introduction; Kaplan\n1967/1979). However, this suggestion, as stated, is vulnerable to the\ncharge that it is the product of confusion. For how could we\nuse a criterion of identity in the way envisaged? We must dismiss as\nfanciful the idea that if we had a criterion of transworld identity\nfor George Eliot, we could use it to tell, by empirical\ninspection of the properties of individuals in other possible\nworlds (perhaps using a powerful telescope (Kripke 1980, 44) or\n\u2018Jules Verne-o-scope\u2019 (Kaplan 1967/1979, 93; Plantinga\n1974, 94)), which, if any, of those individuals is Eliot. For no one\n(including an extreme realist like Lewis) thinks that our\nepistemological access to other possible worlds is of this kind.\n(According to Lewis, other possible worlds are causally isolated from\nour own, and hence beyond the reach of our telescopes or any other\nperceptual devices.) But once we face up to the fact that a criterion\nof transworld identity (if we had one) could have no such empirical\nuse, the argument based on the epistemological assumption appears to\ncollapse. It is tempting to suggest that the argument is the product\nof the (perhaps surreptitious) influence of a misleading picture of\nour epistemological access to other possible worlds. As Kripke writes\n(using President Nixon as his example):\n\nOne thinks, in this [mistaken] picture, of a possible world as if it\nwere like a foreign country. One looks upon it as an observer. Maybe\nNixon has moved to the other country and maybe he hasn\u2019t, but\none is given only qualities. One can observe all his qualities, but,\nof course, one doesn\u2019t observe that someone is Nixon. One\nobserves that something has red hair (or green or yellow) but not\nwhether something is Nixon. So we had better have a way of telling in\nterms of properties when we run into the same thing as we saw before;\nwe had better have a way of telling, when we come across one of these\nother possible worlds, who was Nixon. (1980, 43)\n\n(It is possible, though, that in this passage Kripke\u2019s principal\ntarget is not a mistaken conception of our epistemological access to\nother possible worlds, but what he takes to be a mistaken\n(\u2018foreign country\u2019) conception of their nature: a\nconception that (when divorced from the fanciful epistemology) would\nbe entirely appropriate for a Lewisian realist about worlds.)\n",
