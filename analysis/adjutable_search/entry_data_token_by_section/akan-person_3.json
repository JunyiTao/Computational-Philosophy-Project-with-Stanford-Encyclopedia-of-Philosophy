    "main_text": "Responsibility and Free Will\n4. Responsibility and Free Will\n\n\nAn important condition for achieving personhood is that the agent has\nthe ability to act on the basis of rational reflection. Wiredu\nindicates what is meant by \u201cdamaged personhood\u201d by\npointing out that an Akan adult of unpredictable behavior will bring\nthe judgment that \u201cso-and-so is not a person (onye\n\u2018onipa),\u201d (Wiredu 1992, 108) a comment that leaves\nopen for further investigation whether the damage was done by\npsychological or environmental factors, or by brute bad\nluck. \u201cThe problem in Akan is \u2018when is an individual\nresponsible?\u2019 And the answer in this brief account of the Akan\napproach to deviant conduct is that an individual is responsible to\nthe extent that his conduct can be modified through rational\npersuasion or moral correction\u201d (Wiredu 1992, 108\u201309).\nWiredu concludes that once the cause of the unpredictable behavior is\ndetermined, irresponsibility may change into nonresponsibility, for in\nthe Akan philosophy of person, where there is free will there is\nresponsibility.\n\n\nSince there is a merit component to personhood, it is relevant to talk\nof the distribution of the opportunity of achieving personhood\nso as to secure respect over and above the threshold respect that is\ndue to human beings in virtue of their status as human beings. Goods\nlike positions of prestige that are conferred to individuals who have\nachieved personhood are limited by their very nature, but given\nequality of opportunity, no person should be denied from the outset the\nchance to secure those goods. Here, then, is a tension, for what does\nthe society do to those who are born handicapped or crippled in such a\nway that they are not in the position to achieve personhood in ways\nthat able bodied people can? What happened to Shijuruh born in a family\nof thieves and in a neighborhood full of burglers? Surely, Shijuruh did\nnot choose to be born in that family much less in the neighborhood and\nthis may affect his performance in an attempt to achieve personhood. In\nother words how does one account for equality in unequal\ncircumstances?\n\n\nThe answer provided by the Akan, according to Wiredu's\ninterpretation, is to conceive of the status required for personhood as\ndefined relative to an adult individual's starting position or\ninitial capacity. Wiredu explains that, for example, an adult who\nbehaves erratically or in an immature manner would be presumed to have\nfailed to be a full\n person.[6]\n Such a presumption, however, is\nmerely a presumption, an inference drawn from the superficial\nqualities of the individual's action relative to what could be\nexpected of the average individual. If the individual changes his or\nher behavior, that inference may be revised. If, however, the behavior\npersists, the individual's family members may summon an\nexpert\u2014a geomancer\u2014capable of determining if he or she is\nacting out of free will.\n\n\nProvided that the behavior is found not to be deliberate or that she is\nnot acting from her free will, the community will gather and it will be\nsaid of her a message of this tenure: \u201cIt is not her eyes, it is\nnot her head, it is not her mind,\u201d i.e., she is not responsible\nfor her erratic actions. In making this judgment, the community will be\nchanging irresponsibility to non-responsibility. This is the way the Akan\nhas for equalizing background conditions of individuals in their\nattempt at dealing with the difficulties of equality in unequal\ncircumstances. It is against this background that we can begin to make\nsense of Wiredu's claim that freewill and responsibility are two\nsides of the same coin among the Akan.\n",
