    "main_text": "Death || Death and What We Are\n2.5 Death and What We Are\n\nDeath for you and me is constituted by the loss of our capacity to\nsustain ourselves using vital activities. This characterization of\ndeath could be sharpened if we had a clearer idea of what we\nare, and its implications concerning our persistence. After\nall, we cannot retain any capacities if we fail to persist,\nso if we fail to persist we stop being capable of vital activities. We\ndie. However, what we are, and what is involved in our persistence, is\na matter of controversy.\n\nThere are three main views: animalism, which says that we are\nhuman animals (Snowdon 1990, Olson 1997, 2007); personism,\nwhich says that we are creatures with the capacity for self-awareness;\nand mindism, which says that we are minds (which may or may\nnot have the capacity for self-awareness) (McMahan 2002). Animalists\ntypically say that we persist over time just in case we remain the\nsame animal; mindist typically suggest that our persistence requires\nour remaining the same mind. Personism is usually paired with the view\nthat our persistence is determined by our psychological features and\nthe relations among them (Locke 1689, Parfit 1984). (For more on what\nwe are, see the entry on Personal Identity.)\n\nIf we are animals, with the persistence conditions of animals, we die\nwhen we cease to be the same animal. If we are minds, with the\npersistence conditions for minds, we die when we cease to meet these\nconditions. And if persistence is determined by our retaining certain\npsychological features, then the loss of those features will\nconstitute death.\n\nThese three ways of understanding death have very different\nimplications. Severe dementia can destroy a great many psychological\nfeatures without destroying the mind, which suggests that death as\nunderstood by personists can occur even though death as understood by\nmindists has not. Moreover, human animals sometimes survive the\ndestruction of the mind, as when the cerebrum dies but the brainstem\ndoes not, leaving an individual in a persistent vegetative state. Many\ntheorists also think that the mind could survive the extinction of the\nhuman animal, say when the brain is removed from the body, kept alive\nartificially, and the remainder of the body is destroyed (assuming\nthat a bare brain is not a human animal). These possibilities suggest\nthat death as understood by mindists can occur even though death as\nunderstood by animalists has not (and also that the latter sort of\ndeath need not be accompanied by the former.)\n",
