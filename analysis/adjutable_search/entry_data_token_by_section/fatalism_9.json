    "main_text": "Logical fatalism: Richard Taylor\u2019s argument and the conditions of power\n3. Logical fatalism: Richard Taylor\u2019s argument and the conditions of power\n\nRichard Taylor argues that certain commonly accepted presuppositions\nyield a proof of fatalism (Taylor 1962). The presuppositions are:\n\n\n1. Any proposition whatever is either true, or if not true, false.\n\n2. If any state of affairs is sufficient for, though logically\nunrelated to, the occurrence of some further condition at the same\ntime or any other time, then the former cannot occur without the\nlatter occurring also.\n\n3. If the occurrence of any condition is necessary for, though\nlogically unrelated to, the occurrence of some other condition at the\nsame time, or any other time, then the latter cannot occur without the\nformer occurring also.\n\n4. If one condition or set of conditions is sufficient for (ensures)\nanother, then the other is necessary (essential) for it, and\nconversely, if one condition or set of conditions is necessary\n(essential) for another, then that other is sufficient for (ensures)\nit.\n\n5. No agent can perform any given act if there is lacking, at the same\ntime or any other time, some condition necessary for the occurrence of\nthat act.\n\n6. Time is not by itself \u201cefficacious\u201d; that is, the mere\npassage of time does not augment or diminish the capacities of\nanything and, in particular, it does not enhance or decrease an\nagent\u2019s powers or abilities.\n\n\nHe then produces an argument to show (what most of us believe) that\neither it is not in my power to read a headline saying that there was\na sea-battle yesterday or it is not in my power to read a headline\nsaying that there was no sea-battle yesterday, at any rate if we make\nsome obvious assumptions about the relation between the headlines and\nwhat took place. Letting S be the act of reading a headline\nthat there was a sea-battle, and S\u2032 be the act of\nreading a headline that there was no sea-battle; and letting\nP and P\u2032 be the propositions that there was\nand was not such a battle, the argument goes:\n\nIf P is true, then it is not in my power to do\nS\u2032 (for if P is true, then there is, or was,\nlacking a condition essential for my doing S\u2032, the\ncondition, namely, of there being no sea-battle yesterday).\n\n\nBut if P\u2032 is true, then it is not in my power to do\nS (for a similar reason).\n\nBut either P is true or P\u2032 is true\n\nSo, either it is not in my power to do S or it is not in my\npower to do S\u2032.\n\n\nThe argument, he claims is sound, given the six presuppositions.\n\nBut suppose, his argument continues, we let O and\nO\u2032 be the act of ordering a sea-battle and the act of\nordering no sea-battle, and Q and Q\u2032 be the\npropositions that there will and will not be such a battle; and we\nsubstitute O and O\u2032 for S and\nS\u2032, and Q and Q\u2032 for P\nand P\u2032, and \u201ctomorrow\u201d for\n\u201cyesterday\u201d in the argument above, then (if we make some\nobvious assumptions about the relation between what we order and what\nhappens) we have a parallel argument which goes:\n\nIf Q is true, then it is not in my power to do\nO\u2032 (for if Q is true, then there is, or will\nbe, lacking a condition essential for my doing O\u2032, the\ncondition, namely, of there being no sea-battle tomorrow).\n\n\nBut if Q\u2032 is true, then it is not in my power to do\nO (for a similar reason).\n\nBut either Q is true or Q\u2032 is true\n\nSo, either it is not in my power to do O or it is not in my\npower to do O\u2032.\n\n\nAnd this argument seems equally sound. And evidently it can be\ngeneralised to yield the fatalist conclusion that it is never in our\npower to do anything other than what we actually do.\n\nAre there any objections to his argument?\n\nWell, one might certainly object to presupposition 6, on the grounds\nthat it does indeed seem to be the passage of time which makes a\ndifference to my power to bring about or prevent a sea-battle on a\ncertain day. Till the day is over, I may have the power, but after the\nday, I have not. However, presupposition 6 does not in fact seem to\nplay a significant role in the parallel arguments. So that cannot be\nthe whole story.\n",
