    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nAb\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be\nal-R\u0101z\u012b made his fame mostly as a doctor. As his name\n\u201cal-R\u0101z\u012b\u201d indicates, he hailed from the Persian\ncity of Rayy, near modern-day Tehran. His biographers report that he\nran a hospital there, and another in Baghdad. He received patronage\nfrom Ab\u016b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 al-Man\u1e63\u016br (d. 914),\nthe governor of Rayy, to whom al-R\u0101z\u012b dedicated a\nsubstantial medical treatise, The Book for\nal-Man\u1e63\u016br. We have a variety of anecdotes about\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s medical practice, some found in his own\nworks and some in his medieval biographers, for instance that\nal-R\u0101z\u012b would deal only with patients whose condition\nstumped his students. We also know, because he tells us himself, that\nhe suffered from eye problems and a hand injury from copious reading,\ncopying, and writing.\n\nThis latter piece of information is found in The Philosophical Way\nof Life, which is a good first text to read by al-R\u0101z\u012b\n(Arabic edition in al-R\u0101z\u012b\n RF;\n English translation in al-R\u0101z\u012b\n PWL).\n In it he rebuts accusations that he is a hypocrite for claiming to\nmodel his lifestyle on that of Socrates, when in fact Socrates was\nrigorously ascetic and al-R\u0101z\u012b is not (see Strohmaier 1974).\nAl-R\u0101z\u012b responds by saying that reports of Socrates\u2019\nasceticism, which unbeknownst to him go back to a confusion in the\nsources between Socrates and Diogenes the Cynic, do not tell the whole\nstory. In fact Socrates adopted a lifestyle of moderation as he\nmatured, and it is this model that al-R\u0101z\u012b imitates.\n\nThis is one of only two complete surviving works by al-R\u0101z\u012b\ndevoted solely to a philosophical topic; the other one also deals with\nethics. This is The Spiritual Medicine (Arabic edition in\nal-R\u0101z\u012b RF; English translation in al-R\u0101z\u012b\n SPR\n and for discussion Adamson 2016), a longer book of ethical advice\npresented to his patron al-Man\u1e63\u016br as a complement to the\naforementioned medical treatise. Here al-R\u0101z\u012b offers\ntreatment for the soul, following on his overview of treatments for\nthe body (Adamson 2019). Apart from this, the most significant\nsurviving work for his philosophy is his Doubts about Galen\n(Arabic critical edition and translation by Koetschet in\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\n DG).\n Al-R\u0101z\u012b considered Galen the greatest of medical\nauthorities, but on the basis of Galen\u2019s own critical attitude\ntowards esteemed predecessors, felt free to critique weak points in\nthe extensive corpus of Galenic works that had been translated into\nArabic. While a number of these points naturally concern medicine, the\nDoubts also touches on a wide range of philosophical issues,\nas discussed below.\n\nBeyond this, the extant writings have to do mostly with medicine,\nincluding a number of smaller treatises, like a celebrated text on the\ndifference between smallpox and measles (English translation in\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\n SM), and the by no means small Comprehensive Book, a\nstaggeringly huge collection of notes on medicine that was compiled by\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s students after his death. The\nComprehensive Book is sometimes said to present\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s \u201ccase notes\u201d. But, while it is\ntrue that he reports on his own medical experiences, the work is more\naccurately described as a collection of excerpts from Greek and Arabic\nmedical sources. When he does introduce \u201ccase notes\u201d this\nis to provide counterexamples and amplifications for the textual\nevidence (Savage-Smith 2012). Broadly speaking, despite his often\nharsh diatribe against Galen\u2019s failures in the Doubts,\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s own medical theories fall broadly within the\nGalenic framework, and thus deploy such standard concepts as the four\nhumors, the natural powers of the body, and the role of\npneuma in explaining animal sensation and motion.\n\nA final group of works that come down to us from al-R\u0101z\u012b\ndiscuss alchemy (Ruska 1935). He was evidently a practicing alchemist\nand describes in detail a wide variety of chemical procedures, all\naimed towards the goal of manufacturing valuable minerals and stones,\nor likenesses thereof. It may be that al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s\natomist theory of matter provided him with a basis for understanding\nthese processes. Chemical transformation would involve breaking down\ncomplex substances to more primitive particles and then recombining\nthem in other proportions to produce the desired result (Kraus\n1942\u20133: vol. 2, 10\u201311; Adamson 2021: 96\u201398).\n\nBeyond these extant works we have reports on the full range of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s writings by later authors who recorded lists\nof their titles. These confirm that he wrote much on medicine,\nphilosophy, and alchemy, as well as mathematics, logic, and poetry.\nMost eye-catching here, though, are works in which he discussed\nreligion and, especially, prophecy. The latter bear titles like On\nthe Tricks of Supposed Prophets and On the Necessity of the\nProphetic Mission. That could just show that he was concerned to\nrefute the claims of spurious prophets, while accepting the legitimacy\nof true prophets. But in reports by still other authors, we are given\na picture of al-R\u0101z\u012b as a fundamentally anti-religious\nauthor who rejected all revelation and prophecy. This is especially\nthe case with al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s contemporary, also from Rayy,\nAb\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim al-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 934). In a treatise\ncalled The Proofs of Prophecy, Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim\nrecounts face-to-face debates he had with al-R\u0101z\u012b and then\nsummarizes, and elaborately refutes, a treatise by al-R\u0101z\u012b\nthat supposedly sought to unmask the falsehoods of all revelatory\nreligious traditions (see\n AHR\n in the bibliography).\n\nAlong with Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim, two other sources are crucial\nfor reconstructing al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s cosmology. These are\nNa\u1e63\u012br-e Khosraw (d. 1088), who explained this cosmology in\norder to refute it in his Persian work Provision for the\nTraveler (hereafter\n NK,\n selective trans. into Arabic in al-R\u0101z\u012b RF), and yet\nanother al-R\u0101z\u012b, this time the famous theologian-philosopher\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 1210), in his Exalted\nTopics (hereafter\n FDR).\n From these and a few other sources, we can piece together the details\nof a remarkable account of the creation of the world, which invokes\nfive factors that have always existed and come together to produce the\ncosmos: God, Soul, matter, time, and place. Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim\nand Na\u1e63\u012br-e Khosraw both present this as an appalling\ndeparture from Islam, since it involves postulating four eternal\nprinciples alongside God.\n",
