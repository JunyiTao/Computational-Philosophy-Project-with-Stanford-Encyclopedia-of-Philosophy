    "main_text": "Majority Cultural Rights Claims || Cultural continuity and integration enforcement rights\n4. Conclusion\n\nBoth minority groups (many of which are immigrant groups) and majority\ngroups claim that \u201cculture\u201d is important and deserving of\naccommodation in multiple ways. This entry began with an examination\nof the multiple ways in which culture has been understood, to unpack\nthe ways in which it is deployed when specific cultural rights are\nclaimed. It is important to notice that these cultural claims, on both\nsides, are often made in relation to each other: a minority group\ndemands a particular cultural right and the majority responds by\nclaiming a different cultural right. In many cases, the choice to\nrespect or ignore claimed cultural rights is framed in terms of the\nimpact that doing so will have on the culture of the majority, for\nexample, by stating that a particular practice for which accommodation\nis requested is incompatible with the majority culture in general, or\nsometimes more specifically with a particular practice or norm that is\nbelieved to be particularly important. The latter claim was made, for\nexample, in France, during \u201cl\u2019affaire du\nfoulard\u201d\u2014the right to cover one\u2019s head as a\nmanifestation of Islamic (or Jewish) religious commitment was denied\nfor the way in which it compromised the French\u2019s commitment to\nlaicity (Laborde 2008; Benhabib 2004).\n\nThis entry has attempted to offer the resources that are essential to\nadjudicating these conflicts, in ways that take seriously both those\nwho demand cultural rights\u00a0and those who resist respecting them.\nHopefully, future political theory can make use of this taxonomy to\nidentify satisfactory conclusions to these conflicts when they\narise.\n",
