    "main_text": "Beyond Coherence || Foundations\n5.3 Foundations\n\nA tradition going back at least to Cartwright (1987) is using the\nlanguage of the so-called \u201cAthanasian\u201d creed to generate\ncontradictions, the task of the philosophical theologian then being to\nshow how these can be avoided by more careful\u00a0analysis. This\nLatin document is by an unknown author, and is not the product of any\nknown council. Modern scholarship places it some time in the fifth\ncentury, well after the life of Athanasius (d. 373), and sees it as\ninfluenced by the writings of Augustine (Kelly 1964). Objecting to\nmaking it a standard of trinitarian theology, several authors have\npointed out its dubious provenance and coherence, and have observed\nthat it has mainly been accepted in the Western realm and not in the\nEast, and that it seems to stack the deck against three-self theories\n(Layman 2016 136\u20137, 169\u201371; McCall 2003, 427; Tuggy 2003b,\n450\u201355). Tuggy (2016b) objects that starting with this\nproblematic creed causes analytic theologians to neglect the question\nof if and how the teaching of this creed is\u00a0the same as\nvarious\u00a0statements from the \u201cecumenical\u201d councils,\npre-Nicene theologies, or the Bible. But William Hasker argues that\nrightly understood, the claims of this creed may\u00a0not\u00a0be\nparadoxical, as it is largely concerned with what may and may not be\nsaid (2013b, 250\u20134).\n\nApart from the \u201cAthanasian\u201d creed, H.E. Baber describes\nfive different foundations for theorizing about the Trinity, endorsing\nthe fourth.\n\nThis poses the question of what the \u2018foundations\u2019 for the\nphilosophical investigation of Trinitarian theology should be if it is\nnot either [1] the declarations of Church councils or [2] the\ntheological works of the Fathers or [3] Scripture which\u2026does\nnot include any Trinitarian doctrine. \u2026what philosophical\ntheology should be about\u2026[is] [4] the discourse and practice of\nthe Church, and by that I do not mean [5] the doctrinal claims of the\nChurch in its pretension to being a teaching institution, but [4] the\nliturgy, hymnody, and art, customs and practices, religious objects\nand religious devotions which, together, constitute the Christian\nreligion and its practice. The aim of philosophical theology is to\nmake sense of the discourse and provide a rationale for the practices\nwhile avoiding logical incoherence. (Baber 2019, 186\u20137)\n\n\nSome in the literature fall cleanly into one of Baber\u2019s\ncategories, but more commonly, work in analytic theology is done while\nleaving unclear just what are the foundations of trinitarian\ntheorizing. Following the example of his earlier work on christology,\nTimothy Pawl (2020) focuses on the teachings of the\n\u201cecumenical\u201d councils, which arguably give the central\ntrinitarian language of catholic traditions.\n\nIn favor of Baber\u2019s second approach, Beau Branson (2018)\ncritiques what he calls \u201cthe virtue\napproach\u201d\u2013basically, treating theological issues like\nmetaphysical or logical puzzles calling for creative\ntheorizing\u2013as point-missing, question begging, and\u00a0unclear.\nIn contrast, he advocates for \u201cthe historical approach\u201d,\nwhich assumes that the content of \u201cthe doctrine of the\nTrinity\u201d should be considered as fixed by the views of\n\u201cmainly various fourth-century theologians\u201d (Section 4).\nIt is misguided, he argues, to focus merely on the theoretical virtues\nof various rational reconstructions of what traditional Trinity\nlanguage is really supposed to be expressing, as most of these will\nnot plausibly be expressing the historical doctrine.\nNew-fangled accounts, Branson argues, have a burden of showing how\nthey, if coherent, imply that the historical doctrine of the Trinity\nis coherent, and indeed why the former should even count as a version\nof the latter (Section 5). (Similarly with other theoretical virtues.)\nAt any rate, nothing about the project of analytic theology requires\nthe neglect of the crucial historical definers of the Trinity doctrine\n(Section 13).\n\nAnalytic theologians have expended much effort on metaphysical models\nwhich if accurate would arguably show that \u201cthe\ndoctrine of the Trinity\u201d is coherent (i.e. seemingly not\nself-contradictory). But only a recent monograph by Vlastimil\nVoh\u00e1nka (2014) asks in depth how, if at all, a person might be\nable to know that the doctrine of the Trinity is logically possible.\nVoh\u00e1nka argues for \u201cWeak Modal Scepticism about the\nTrinity Doctrine\u201d (83), which is the claim that \u201cit is\npsychologically impossible to see evidently and apart from religious\nexperience that the Trinity doctrine is logically possible\u201d\n(86). The arguments for this conclusion defy easy summary (but see\nChapter 7 and Jaskolla 2015). What is \u201cthe doctrine\u201d in\nquestion? Voh\u00e1nka uses a minimal definition, that \u201cthere\nare three persons, each of whom is God but there is just one being\nwhich is God\u201d (47). Admittedly, this better fits one-self\ntheories than it does three or four-self theories (52\u20137) Like\nmost, Voh\u00e1nka assumes that a Trinity doctrine is essential to\nChristianity (57\u20138), so the main thesis implies the\nimpossibility of knowing that Christianity is logically possible. But\nthe overall project is not an attack on the truth or knowability of\nChristianity (see the author\u2019s clarifications about his aims on\n244\u20137, 276\u20137). Rather, such claims as the Trinity and\nChristianity seemingly can\u2019t be evident to us (i.e. roughly,\ncan\u2019t be obviously true to us, as is 1+1=2 and such\npropositions\u2013see 18), and moreover, we shouldn\u2019t expect\nthat we\u2019ll have any religious experience in this life which is\nsufficient to make them evident (277). For all that\u2019s been said,\nsuch claims \u201cmay well be epistemically justified, well-argued,\nhave clearly high non-logical probability, etc.\u201d (279). But the\nChristian philosopher should give up on \u201cfulfilling the\nclassical idea of evidentness in matters viewed by him as of utmost\nimportance: the truth of Christianity and of the Trinity\ndoctrine\u201d (ibid.).\n",
