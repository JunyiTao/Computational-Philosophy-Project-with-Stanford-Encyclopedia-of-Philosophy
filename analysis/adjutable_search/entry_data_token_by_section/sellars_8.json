    "main_text": "Science and Reality\n6. Science and Reality\nSellars was a significant philosopher of science and a staunch\ndefender of scientific realism.  He often couched his discussions in\nthe terms made common by the logical empiricists, but he was in many\nways a subversive philosopher of science, undermining the irenic\ninstrumentalism popular in the 1950s  and \u201860s (e.g., the views defended by Ernest Nagel)in favor of a\nposition that might seem oxymoronic: a pragmatic realism.  \nWe can start with the distinction between observational\nand theoretical vocabularies.  Many empiricists were\nwedded to the myth of the given, assuming that there is a privileged\nobservation vocabulary.  The meanings of observation terms were\ndetermined by their relation to what is given and were thus\nunrevisable or incorrigible.  This vocabulary grounds the meaning of\nall empirical language.  Two kinds of generalizations were recognized:\n(1) empirical generalizations formulated in the observation language\nand justified by straightforward inductive methods, and (2)\nhigher-level generalizations formulated in a more abstract,\ntheoretical idiom including novel theoretical posits.  This\ntheoretical language consists of terms invented in order to better\norganize, generalize, and make connections among the assertions and\ngeneralizations made in the observation language.  The ideal would be\na formal axiomatic structure that would allow a deduction of the\nempirical generalizations which, combined with statements of initial\nconditions, permit a deduction of particular empirical facts (thus\nexplaining their truth). \nThe observational/theoretical vocabulary distinction, thus\nconceived, was taken to have ontological implications.  We are\ncommitted to the existence of the given, for that is what ties thought\nto reality.  Theories, however, are merely tools to enable us to\nexplain observation-level empirical generalizations.  Presumably, some\nempirical generalizations may be first derived with the help of a\ntheory, but they are subject to more direct investigation and\ncorroboration, so the theory is not essential to it.  Thus,\nthere is no ontological commitment to any entities that theories\npostulate; they can be viewed as convenient fictions, devices of\ncalculation. \nSellars thinks that this instrumentalist picture gets almost\neverything wrong.  In his view the observation vocabulary/theoretical\nvocabulary distinction is merely methodological and is, moreover,\nhighly malleable; it therefore possesses no particular ontological\nforce.  There is no given, so it can play no semantic role.  Meanings\nare functional roles in language usage, and nothing in principle\nprevents a term that might originally have arisen as part of a theory\nfrom acquiring a role in observation reports.  The well-trained\nphysicist \u201cjust sees\u201d an alpha-particle track in a cloud\nchamber as directly and non-inferentially as the well-trained child\njust sees a dog.  Furthermore, what is observable depends on the\ntechniques and instruments employed, and these are often loaded with\ntheoretical baggage.  \u201cPure\u201d observation uncontaminated by\ntheory is outside our reach.  A good theory, according to Sellars,\ndoes not just explain the observation-level empirical generalizations,\nit also explains why those empirical generalizations are as good (and\nas wrong) as they are.  The Boyle-Charles ideal gas law works well in\nmost conditions, but does not predict the behavior of gasses under\nextreme temperatures or pressures.  The van der Waals equation,\nexplicitly formulated with the theory of statistical thermodynamics in\nmind, allows us to see why the Boyle-Charles law is as good as it is\nand why it breaks down where it does.  Sellars therefore rejects the\n\u201clayer-cake\u201d view that there are three distinct levels of\nassertion in the empirical sciences: observation level claims of\nparticular fact, empirical generalizations using the observation\nvocabulary, and, finally, claims using a theoretical vocabulary which\nfunction to systematize the empirical generalizations.  In the\n\u201clayer-cake\u201d view, theories are ultimately dispensable in\nfavor of observation-level empirical generalizations; in\nSellars\u2019s view, it is the observation-level empirical\ngeneralizations that are ultimately dispensable in favor of the better\nexplanations made available by theory.  Thus, to have good reason to\naccept a theory is to have good reason to believe in the existence of\nthose entities it postulates.\nThis is the basic reasoning behind Sellars\u2019s scientific\nrealism.  His bold claim, \u201cIn the dimension of describing\nand explaining the world, science is the measure of all things, of\nwhat is that it is, and of what is not that it is not\u201d (EPM:\n\u00a741, in SPR: 173; in KMG: 253) needs proper\ninterpretation, as mentioned above.  Sellars does not believe, for instance, that\ndescribing and explaining are the only \u201cdimensions\u201d of\nlinguistic activity.  Prescribing, evaluating, and negotiating are\nequally indispensable dimensions of language use that go beyond the descriptive brief of science.  It is science\u2019s job to limn the structure of\nempirical reality, the causal nexus within which we live, but, as his\nown call for a \u201csynoptic vision\u201d that unites a\nscience-generated picture of empirical reality with \u201cthe\nlanguage of community and individual intentions\u201d indicates,\nSellars would never hold that all our questions are to be settled by\nscientific investigations. \nSellars also has a distinctive treatment of scientific laws.  Laws\nare standardly treated as generalizations; they are distinguished\nfrom accidental generalizations because laws have a modal force\ncapable of supporting counterfactuals.  In Sellars\u2019s view, laws\nare better understood as inference tickets.  Though they have\ndescriptive content, statements of laws serve a different function in\nour language.  As mentioned above, Sellars treats modals uniformly as\nmaterial-mode metalinguistic speech expressing the inferential\ncommitments and priorities embedded in the language.  So, saying that\nit is a law of nature that e.g., the angle of incidence equals the\nangle of reflection, endorses a certain set of inferences using those\nconcepts.  Furthermore, Sellars does not think of language as a fixed\nentity.  Indeed, in his conception, the job of the sciences is to\nmethodically revise and replace the resources available for\ndescription and explanation.  Conceptual change is the very essence of\nscience.  In his view, laws of nature are proposed connections among\nconcepts or terms that, pending possible empirical disconfirmation,\ncan be rationally attached to the concepts.\n[S]cientific terms have, as part of their logic a\n\u2018line of retreat\u2019 as well as a \u2018plan of\nadvance\u2019 \u2014 a fact which makes meaningful the claim that in\nan important sense A and B are the \u2018same\u2019 properties they\nwere \u2018before.\u2019 \u2026 The motto of the age of science\nmight well be: natural philosophers have hitherto sought to understand\n\u2018meanings\u2019; the task is to change them (CDCM:\n288).\nThus, I call his philosophy of science a \u2018pragmatic\nrealism\u2019 because he insists on our commitment to the reality of\nthe objects to be posited by Peircean ideal science, while\nexplicating most of the structural features of science in terms\nof the pragmatic force of their linguistic expression.  \n",
