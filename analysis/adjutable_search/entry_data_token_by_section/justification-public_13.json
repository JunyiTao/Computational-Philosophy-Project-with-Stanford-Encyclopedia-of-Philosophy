    "main_text": "Sister Concepts || Stability\n5.2 Stability\n\nStability is the other sister concept to public justification. Many\npublic reason liberals think publicly justified principles must be\nsomehow morally stable. Rawls (2005, 140\u20133) advances this line:\npublic justification helps political conceptions become \u201cstable\nfor the right reasons.\u201d\n\nWeithman (2011) argues that Rawls\u2019s changing ideal of stability\ndrove revisions to his theory. Rawls wanted his political principles\nto reach stability in a diverse society despite reasonable pluralism.\nIn some ways, concerns about stability are a reason to care about\npublic justification. A community may only reach moral stability, that\nis, stability for the right reasons if each person has moral reason to\nendorse society\u2019s coercive power. Otherwise, stability rests on\na balance of power alone\u2014a modus vivendi regime.\n\nSome theorists draw a looser connection between stability and public\njustification. Whether a principle can stabilize is a reason to prefer\nit over less stable principles. (Rawls sometimes talks this way in\nTheory.) Stability may also help vindicate a conception of\npublic justification over others. So, suppose that a convergence view\nhelps justify laws in ways that promote stability. If so, we may have\nreason to adopt a convergence over a consensus view.\n\nRawls\u2019s focus on stability raises another complex issue. The\npresent entry addressed idealizing persons as reasonable or not\n(2.4.3). Some idealizations attribute reasons to citizens based on\nwhat they would reasonably endorse. Stability is also sometimes\nmoralized. It is valuable only when based on \u201cthe right\nreasons.\u201d Rawls resists merely prescriptive stability, however.\nHe does not want to stabilize a society based only on what ought to\nmake it stable. Instead, stability has content apart from its basis in\nmoral reasons. A community can be unstable even if its institutions\nrest on reasonable grounds. Stability has an ethical ideal and a\ndescriptive ideal of real stability. Public justification then can\nhave both moral and descriptive parts. Publicly justified rules are\nboth real and justified. Gaus has criticized Rawls (1996, 130\u20136)\nfor his populist conception of stability. He has developed an\nalternative (2011, 389\u2013408). So, many public justification\ntheorists feel the pull of descriptive and moral stability. But some,\nlike Quong (2011), adopt a purely normative notion.\n\nFollowing Weithman (2011), philosophers now explore stabilization\nmechanisms. Weithman argues that public reasons create stability for\nthe right reasons and that this was Rawls\u2019s view.\n\nVallier and John Thrasher (2015) think public reasons are poor\nassurance signals. They raise problems associated with cheap talk and\nmisinformation. These factors may be present even in well-ordered\nsocieties. Kogelmann and Steven H. W. Stich (2016) embrace convergence\ndiscourse for stability. Convergence allows people to use diverse\nreasons as costly signals of cooperative inclinations. It takes a\ngreat deal of effort to speak the political languages of various\ngroups. The use of diverse discourse can thus create stability. This\nliterature continues to bear fruit.\n",
