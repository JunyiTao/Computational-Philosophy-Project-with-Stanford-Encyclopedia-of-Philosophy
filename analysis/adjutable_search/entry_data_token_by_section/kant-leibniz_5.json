Perception and Thought\n\nKant\u2019s rejection of Leibniz\u2019s Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles is related to his complaint that the Leibnizians\ntreated perception and thought as a single representational faculty\nthat was \u201clogically\u201d (by which Kant meant\n\u201cqualitatively\u201d) distinguished in terms of the clarity of\nthe representation, rather than \u201ctranscendentally.\u201d With\ntheir theory of a single cognitive faculty, Kant maintained, Leibniz\nand Wolff \u201cabolished the distinction between phenomena and\nnoumena to the great detriment of philosophy.\u201d Leibniz treated\nthe senses according to Kant as an inferior mode of cognition, the\nsenses having only the \u201cdespicable task\u201d of confusing and\ndistorting the representations of reason (KRV B. 332).\n\nThe basis of this accusation was Leibniz\u2019s attribution to the\nsoul of only two basic faculties: perception, the representation of\nmultiplicity in a simple soul, and appetition, which he defines as\n\u201cthe action of an internal principle which brings about change\nor the passage from one perception to another\u201d (G 6:\n608\u20139). Perceptions, in Leibniz, as in Descartes, are thoughts\n\u2014 presentations in the mind. The perceptual thought that there\nis a green tree in front of me is not absolutely unlike the\nmathematical thought that triangles have three angles. Perception of\nmaterial objects is \u201cconfused\u201d because \u2014 according\nto the Cartesian tradition \u2014 corporeal substance has no colours\nor other sensory properties \u2014 which come into being through the\ninteraction of the mind and tiny, single imperceptible, uncoloured\ncorpuscles of matter. Though Leibniz denied the existence of purely\nmaterial corpuscles and the possibility of causal influx or even\ninteraction between real substances, he agreed that, from the\nperspective of what he sometimes terms mere physical science,\nperception required interaction, and that corpuscular motions were\ninvolved in the perception of sensory qualities such as light and\ncolour. Perception can therefore be said to confuse what reason\ndelivers to us clearly (A 132, 219, 403). Though we are unable to\ngrasp the sufficient reason of particular colours, there is nothing\narbitrary in their connection with their underlying causes (A\n382f).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s interpreters, Wolff and Baumgarten, enunciate more\ndogmatically the theory that there is a single faculty of\nrepresentation in the soul, with perception and cognition\ncorresponding to its lower and higher parts. It was this view that\nKant presented as entirely opposed to his own teaching with regard to\nthe faculties of the soul. Sensibility, for Kant, is the\n\u201creceptivity of the subject by which it is possible for the\nsubject\u2019s own representative state to be affected in a\nparticular way by the presence of some object.\u201d Thought is\n\u201cthe faculty of the subject by which it has the power to\nrepresent things which cannot by their own quality come before the\nsense of that subject\u201d (2:392). Thought implies an ability to\nexperience representations of another type not involving the forms of\nsensibility \u2014 space, time, and causality. Spatio-temporal\nfeatures are attached to all our perceptions and to our perceptual\nthoughts, but not to the concepts we entertain descriptively. We can\nthink of things in themselves, and even of God, the soul, and\nother such entities, acknowledging their existence and even their\npowers, but we do not perceive them and we cannot represent them in\nsensuous form.\n\nIn his late philosophy, Leibniz distinguished between \u201csimple\nmonads,\u201d which despite their representational and appetitive\nfaculties, merely experienced something like our swoons and dreamless\nsleeps; \u201csouls,\u201d belonging to animals with sensory organs\nthat had awareness of an environment and desires; and\n\u201cspirits,\u201d who were able to grasp necessary truths and\nexperience more complex appetitions such as desiring the good (G 6:\n610\u201312). All monads, according to Leibniz, are confusedly\nomniscient (G 6: 604). Kant was scornful of what he regarded as\ntranscendental reverie. The \u201cslumbering monad\u201d with its\ndim presentations, is, he complains, \u201cnot explained, but\nmade-up\u201d (2.277). The notion that the slumbering monads might\nawake to climb the ladder of awareness recalls, he said, \u201ca kind\nof enchanted world\u201d (20:285). However, Kant was favourably\ndisposed, at least in his early years, towards Leibniz\u2019s\ndoctrine of confused omniscience, and he essentially accepts\nLeibniz\u2019s conception of the mind as innately stocked with, as\nLeibniz expresses it, \u201cinclinations, dispositions, tendencies or\nnatural potentials\u201d (A 52). In his early essay on Negative\nQuantities, Kant remarks \u201cThere is something great and I\nthink, very correct in Leibniz\u2019s notion that the soul embraces\nthe entire universe with its representational powers, although only an\ninfinitely small part of this representation is\nclear\u2026\u2026Outer things can carry the condition of their\npresentation, but not the force to bring themselves into existence for\nus. The powers of thought of the soul must have real\ngrounds\u2026\u201d (2.199). Though Kant later professed\nagnosticism as to whether perception and mentality in general were\nexplicable mechanically, the emphasis on the active powers of the mind\nby contrast with the passivity of matter remains important in his\ntheory of mind.\n\nThe distinction between perception and thought signaled Kant\u2019s\nbreak with rationalist metaphysics but enabled him to deploy a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy against dogmatic claims. By showing how\neach mode of apprehension involved certain necessary and distinct\nlimitations on its employment, Kant was able to show that certain\nkinds of assertion in theology and metaphysics could not be genuine\nknowledge-claims. Perception was limited by the kinds of bodies we had\nand the manner in which we could be affected by external objects. We\ncould not acquire scientific knowledge of the origins of the universe,\nor of our condition after death. Pure reason could not fill in details\nthat were beyond all possible experience. The claims of metaphysics\nhad to be synthetic, informative and not true by definition, yet a\npriori true. Arithmetic and geometry supplied synthetic a\npriori truths in abundance, and natural science supplied\nsynthetic a posteriori truths, as well as exhibiting\nsynthetic a priori propositions, such as the conservation of\nforce.\n\nAlready in his prize essay of 1764, the Investigation of the\nIntelligibility of the Fundamental Principles of Natural Theology and\nMorals, Kant claimed that moral and theological principles were\nnot capable of demonstration, since their terms, unlike mathematical\nterms, lacked precise definition. Geometrical concepts lend themselves\nto use in demonstrations because they are constructed and presented to\nintuition, which is impossible with respect to metaphysical concepts\nsuch as the soul. In the Critique of Pure Reason, he says:\n\u201cIf anyone were to pose the question to me: What is the\nconstitution of a thing that thinks? then I do not know the least\nthing to answer a priori, because the answer ought to be\nsynthetic\u2026But for every synthetic solution, intuition is\nnecessary; but this is entirely left out of so universal a\nproblem\u201d (KRV A 398). The Prolegomena returns to the\nquestion how metaphysics can, like natural science and mathematics,\nemploy synthetic judgments when its concepts are not given in\nexperience and are not constructed. Kant\u2019s answer is that\nmetaphysical judgments do not point to objects existing beyond all\npossible experience, but posit objects needed to\n\u201ccomplete\u201d our understanding, that is, to make our\nthinking systematic and untroubled by gaps and aporias. The soul is\nnot a supersensible object of whose faculties and powers we can\nacquire knowledge but an idea that makes our practice of ascribing\nexperiences to ourselves intelligible.\n",
