    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nRelatively little is known for certain about Machiavelli\u2019s early\nlife in comparison with many important figures of the Italian\nRenaissance (the following section draws on Capponi 2010; Vivanti\n2013; Celenza 2015; Lee 2020) He was born 3 May 1469 in Florence and\nat a young age became a pupil of a renowned Latin teacher, Paolo da\nRonciglione. It is speculated that he attended the University of\nFlorence, and even a cursory glance at his corpus reveals that he\nreceived an excellent humanist education. It is only with his entrance\ninto public view, with his appointment in 1498 as the Second\nChancellor of the Republic of Florence, however, that we begin to\nacquire a full and accurate picture of his life. For the next fourteen\nyears, Machiavelli engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity on\nbehalf of Florence, traveling to the major centers of Italy as well as\nto the royal court of France and to the imperial curia of\nMaximilian.\n\nFlorence had been under a republican government since 1494, when the\nleading Medici family and its supporters had been driven from power.\nAfter four years under Savonarola\u2019s leadership (and eventual\ndownfall), the Florentine Republic sought more stable government and\nreformed its institutions accordingly. During this time, Machiavelli\nentered public service and thrived under the patronage of the\ncity\u2019s gonfaloniere (or chief administrator) for life,\nPiero Soderini, who was elected to that position in 1502. In his\nofficial capacities, Machiavelli travelled considerably, producing a\nlarge body of dispatches (known as the Legations) reporting\non events across Europe. He also composed personal correspondence,\npoetic works, and short political analyses (Nederman 2023). In 1512,\nhowever, with the assistance of Spanish and papal troops, the Medici\ndefeated the republic\u2019s civic militia (which Machiavelli had\norganized) and dissolved its government. Machiavelli was a direct\nvictim of the regime change: he was immediately dismissed from office\nand, when he was (wrongly) suspected of conspiring against the Medici,\nwas imprisoned and tortured for several weeks in early 1513. His\nretirement thereafter to his family farm outside of Florence afforded\nthe occasion and the impetus for him to turn to intellectual\npursuits.\n\nThe first of his writings in a more reflective vein was also\nultimately the one most commonly associated with his name, The\nPrince. Penned at the end of 1513 (and perhaps early 1514), but\nonly published posthumously in 1532, The Prince was composed\nin haste by an author who, among other things, sought to regain his\nstatus in Florentine political affairs. (Many of his colleagues in the\nprevious republican government were quickly rehabilitated and returned\nto service under the Medici.) Originally written for presentation to\nGiuliano de\u2019Medici (who may well have appreciated it), the\ndedication was changed, upon Giuliano\u2019s death, to Lorenzo\nde\u2019Medici (the Younger), who almost certainly did not read it\nwhen it came into his hands in 1516.\n\nMeanwhile, Machiavelli\u2019s retirement from politics led him to\nother literary activities. He wrote verse, plays, and short prose,\nauthored a study of The Art of War (published in 1521), and\nproduced biographical and historical sketches. Most importantly, he\ncomposed his other major contribution to political thought, the\nDiscourses on the Ten Books of Titus Livy, an exposition of\nthe principles of republican rule masquerading as a commentary on the\nwork of the famous historian of the Roman Republic. Unlike The\nPrince, the Discourses was written over a long period of\ntime (commencing perhaps in 1514 or 1515 and completed in 1518 or\n1519, although again only published posthumously in 1531). The book\nmay have been shaped by informal discussions attended by Machiavelli\namong some of the leading Florentine intellectual and political\nfigures under the sponsorship of Cosimo Rucellai.\n\nNear the end of his life, and probably as a result of the aid of\nwell-connected friends whom he never stopped badgering for\nintervention, Machiavelli began to return to the favor of the Medici\nfamily. In 1520, he was commissioned by Cardinal Giulio\nde\u2019Medici to compose a history of Florence (the so-called\nFlorentine Histories), an assignment completed in 1525 and\npresented to the Cardinal, who had since ascended to the papal throne\nas Clement VII, in Rome. Other small tasks were forthcoming from the\nMedici government, but before the opportunity arose for him to return\nfully to public life, he died on 21 June 1527.\n",
