    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nJacques Maritain was born on November 18, 1882 in Paris. The son of\nPaul Maritain, a prominent lawyer, and Genevi\u00e8ve Favre,\ndaughter of the French statesman, Jules Favre, Jacques Maritain\nstudied at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV (1898\u201399) and at the\nSorbonne, where he prepared a licence in philosophy\n(1900\u201301) and in the natural sciences (1901\u201302). He was\ninitially attracted to the philosophy of Spinoza. \n\nIn 1901, Maritain met Ra\u00efssa Oumansoff, a fellow student at the\nSorbonne and the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. Both were\nstruck by the spiritual aridity of French intellectual life and made a\nvow to commit suicide within a year should they not find some answer\nto the apparent meaninglessness of life. Largely at the suggestion of\nhis friend, the poet and religious thinker Charles P\u00e9guy,\nMaritain attended lectures by Henri Bergson at the Coll\u00e8ge de\nFrance (1903\u201304). Bergson\u2019s challenges to the\nthen-dominant positivism sufficed to lead Jacques and Ra\u00efssa to\ngive up their thoughts of suicide, and they married in 1904. Soon\nthereafter, through the influence of the writer L\u00e9on Bloy, both\nMaritains, as well as Ra\u00efssa\u2019s sister, Vera, sought baptism\nin the Roman Catholic Church (1906). (Vera would live with Jacques and\nRa\u00efssa for the rest of her life.)\n\nMaritain received his agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1905\nand, late in 1906, Jacques and Ra\u00efssa left for Heidelberg, where\nJacques continued his studies in the natural sciences. They returned\nto France in the summer of 1908, and it was at this time that the\nMaritains explicitly abandoned bergsonisme and Jacques began\nan intensive study of the writings of Thomas Aquinas. Recent studies\nhave argued that the influence of Bergson can nevertheless be found\nthroughout Maritain\u2019s writings (Nelson 2007; Gwozdz 2010)\n\nIn 1912, Maritain became professor of philosophy at the Lyc\u00e9e\nStanislaus, though he also gave courses at the Institut Catholique de\nParis. He was named Assistant Professor at the Institut Catholique\n(attached to the Chair of the History of Modern Philosophy) in 1914.\nHe became full Professor in 1921 and, in 1928, was appointed to the\nChair of Logic and Cosmology, which he held until 1939.\n\nIn his early philosophical work (e.g., \u201cLa science moderne et la\nraison\u201d, 1910, and\nLa philosophie bergsonienne, 1914), Maritain sought to defend\nThomistic philosophy from its Bergsonian and secular opponents.\nFollowing brief service in the first world war, Maritain returned to\nteaching and research. The focus of his philosophical work continued\nto be the defense of Thomist and, more generally, Catholic thought\n(e.g., Antimoderne [1922], Trois r\u00e9formateurs:\nLuther, Descartes, Rousseau [1925], and Clairvoyance de Rome\npar les auteurs du \u2018Pourquoi Rome a parl\u00e9\u2019 (J.\nMaritain et D. Lallement) [1929]), but Maritain also authored\nsome introductory philosophical texts (e.g.,\n\u00c9l\u00e9ments de philosophie [2 volumes,\n1920\u201323]) and his interests expanded to include aesthetics\n(e.g., Art et scholastique, 1920; 2nd ed.\n1927).\n\nBy the late 1920s, Maritain\u2019s attention began to turn to social\nissues. Although he had some contact with the Catholic social action\nmovement, Action Fran\u00e7aise, he abandoned it in 1926\nwhen it was condemned by Pope Pius XI for its nationalistic and\nanti-democratic tendencies. Nevertheless, encouraged through his\nfriendships with the Russian philosopher Nicholas Berdiaev (beginning\nin 1924) and Emmanuel Mounier (from 1928), Maritain began to develop\nthe principles of a liberal Christian humanism and defense of natural\nrights.\n\nMaritain\u2019s philosophical work came to be more eclectic, with the\npublication of books on Thomas Aquinas (1930), on religion and culture\n(1930), on Christian philosophy (1933), on Descartes (1932), on the\nphilosophy of science and epistemology (Distinguer pour unir; ou,\nles degr\u00e9s du savoir, 1932) and, perhaps most importantly,\non political philosophy. Beginning in 1936, he produced a number of\ntexts, including Humanisme int\u00e9gral (1936), De la\njustice politique (1940), Les droits de l\u2019homme et la\nloi naturelle (1942), Christianisme et d\u00e9mocratie\n(1943), Principes d\u2019une politique humaniste (1944),\nLa personne et le bien commun (1947), Man and the\nState (written in 1949, but published in 1951), and the\nposthumously published La loi naturelle ou loi\nnon-\u00e9crite (based on lectures delivered in August\n1950).\n\nMaritain\u2019s ideas were especially influential in Latin America\nand, largely as a result of the \u2018liberal\u2019 character of his\npolitical philosophy, he increasingly came under attack from both the\nleft and the right, in France and abroad. Lectures in Latin America in\n1936 led to him being named as a corresponding member of the Brazilian\nAcademy of Letters, but also to being the object of a campaign of\nvilification in Chile as \u201ca man of the left\u201d (Compagnon\n2003: 167).\n\nFrom the early 1930s Maritain was an established figure in Catholic\nthought. He visited North and South America and, beginning in January\n1933, came periodically to the Institute of Mediaeval Studies and to\nSt Michael\u2019s College in Toronto (Canada) to give courses of\nlectures. Following his lectures in Toronto at the beginning of 1940,\nhe moved to New York. With the occupation of France by the German\nmilitary in June 1940, the Maritains decided not to return to France;\nJacques taught at Columbia University (1941\u201344) as well as at\nPrinceton (1941\u201342).\n\nWhile in the United States during the war, Maritain was active in the\nwar effort, recording broadcasts destined for occupied France and\ncontributing to the Voice of America. He continued to lecture and\npublish on a wide range of subjects\u2014not only in political\nphilosophy, but in aesthetics (e.g., Art and Poetry, 1943\n[French original 1935]), philosophy of education, and metaphysics\n(De Bergson \u00e0 St Thomas d\u2019Aquin, 1944).\nFollowing the liberation of France in the summer of 1944, he was named\nFrench ambassador to the Holy See, serving until 1948, but was also a\nmember of (and, for a time, Head) of the French delegation to UNESCO,\nand was importantly involved in the promotion and, indirectly, in the\ndrafting of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n(1948).\n\nIn the spring of 1948, Maritain returned to Princeton as Professor of\nPhilosophy; he also lectured at a number of American universities\n(particularly at the University of Notre Dame and the University of\nChicago), but frequently returned to France to give short courses in\nphilosophy\u2014notably at \u2018L\u2019Eau vive\u2019, in the\ntown of Soisy, near Paris. During this time, in addition to his work\nin political philosophy (cf. above, as well as Le philosophe dans\nla cit\u00e9, 1960), Maritain published on aesthetics\n(Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry, 1953), religion\n(Approches de Dieu, 1953), moral philosophy (Neuf\nle\u00e7ons sur les notions premi\u00e8res de la philosophie\nmorale, 1951; La philosophie morale, 1960), and the\nphilosophy of history (On the Philosophy of History,\n1957).\n\nIn 1952, at the age of seventy, Maritain retired from Princeton, but\ncontinued living and periodically lecturing there as Professor\nEmeritus. After the death of Ra\u00efssa\u2019s sister Vera in\nPrinceton in December, 1959, the Maritains returned to France.\nFollowing Ra\u00efssa\u2019s death in November 1960, Jacques moved to\nToulouse, where he decided to live with a religious order, the Little\nBrothers of Jesus. During this time he wrote a number of books, the\nbest-known of which was Le paysan de la Garonne (a work\nsharply critical of post-Vatican Council reforms), published in late\n1966. In 1970, he petitioned to join the order, and died in Toulouse\non April 28, 1973. He is buried alongside Ra\u00efssa in Kolbsheim\n(Alsace) France.\n",
