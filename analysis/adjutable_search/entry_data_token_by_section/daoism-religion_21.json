Gods and Rituals\n\nIn China, the boundaries among Daoism, Buddhism, and the common\nreligion are much less marked compared to those among monotheistic\nreligions. According to individual needs and circumstances, lay\npersons may perform cults and address prayers and petitions\nindifferently to Daoist, Buddhist, or popular deities.\n\nThis has placed Daoism in close touch with the common religion, but\nhas also been the reason for a controversial relation. Daoism attempts\nto undertake the dual task\u2014by no means always\nsuccessful\u2014of drawing people closer to the deities that\nrepresent the Dao, while at the same time responding to their\nimmediate religious demands. As a consequence, in the words of Peter\nNickerson (2008: 148), \n\n\nTaoists, precisely because they relied upon traditions of practice\nthey claimed to have superseded, were compelled to try to distinguish\nthemselves from their popular predecessors and competitors. \n\n\nDemonizing the gods of popular religion was one of the options\n(Mollier 2005): in the course of its history Daoism has prohibited\ncults to minor deities and spirits, just like it has proscribed\nacupuncture (healing is supposed to occur by confession of sins or\nother ritual means overseen by a Daoist officiant) and divination\n(performed by lay specialists who do not belong to Daoist schools or\nlineages). Yet, plenty of examples show that the opposite attitude was\nalso applied. To quote Nickerson again, \n\n\nalready in early medieval times, Taoism was including in its rites a\nnumber of prohibited practices, and the popular cults themselves were\nbeginning to employ Taoist priests. (Nickerson, id.; on this subject\nsee also Stein 1979; Lagerwey 1987: 241\u201352).\n\n\nOne reason at the basis of these divergent\u2014more precisely,\ncontradictory\u2014attitudes may be the intent of exploiting the\npopularity of certain cults and the demand for certain basic religious\nservices. Another reason may be the attempt of not alienating lay\npersons and of paying tribute to local religious traditions. In any of\nthese cases, Daoism incorporates certain practices of common religion\ninto its rites and includes certain gods of common religion into its\npantheon. Yet, the stated purpose of Daoism remains the one of\n\u201ctransforming\u201d (hua) the people, a term that in\nthis context means educating them to venerate the deities that\nimpersonate the Dao, instead of relying on cults to minor deities and\nspirits and on rites performed by other officiants\u2014in\nparticular, the spirit-medium. Such cults and rites are defined in\nDaoism as \u201cvulgar\u201d (or \u201cprofane\u201d, su)\nand \u201cexcessive\u201d (or \u201cillicit\u201d, yin),\nand have been condemned throughout its history (Kleeman 1994). As\nhas been noted, the first competitor of the Daoist priest within local\ncommunities, in past and present times, is not the Buddhist monk or\nthe Confucian officer, but the spirit-medium (Seidel 1997: 62; see\nLagerwey 1987: 216\u201318, for an amusing but revealing\nepisode).\n",
