    "main_text": "Political Theory || Society and Government\n2.1 Society and Government\n\nIn Common Sense Paine opens his account with the contrast\nbetween society and government: \u2018Society is produced by our\nwants and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our\nhappiness positively by uniting our affections, the latter\nnegatively by restraining our vices\u2019 (CW I, 4). [CW\nrefers to The Complete Writings of Thomas Paine, P.S. Foner\n(ed.), 1945.] As with many Paine claims, this seems simple, intuitive,\nand attractive. Our interests unite us, and it is only when we\noverstep the legitimate bounds of those interests, or push them to the\ndetriment of others, that we need constraint. But when we do that, we\nought to know better, and as such Government can appropriately be\nregarded as constraining our vices. What is less clear is how far we\nmust assume vice (and thereby government). \u2018Society in every\nstate is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a\nnecessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one.\u2019 The\nopening of Common Sense can be read as a gloss on\nLocke\u2019s Second Treatise, without the references to God.\nYet Paine claimed never to have read Locke. He also seems clear in his\nfirst major pamphlet that government \u2018is a mode rendered\nnecessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world\u2019\n(CW I, 6). The issue, then is how extensive must government be, and\nwhat sort of government provides the necessary benefits, without\nmultiplying the evils. Paine\u2019s view is that \u2018the more\nsimple anything is, the less liable it is to be\ndisordered\u2026\u2019 Simple government for Paine is\n\u2018republican government\u2019: he rejects monarchical and mixed\nforms of government, in favour of a system in which \u2018the liberty\nof choosing an House of Commons out of their own body\u2019 is the\nkey republican moment (CW I, 16).\n\nPaine\u2019s attack on monarchy in Common Sense is\nessentially an attack on George III. Whereas colonial resentments were\noriginally directed primarily against the king\u2019s ministers and\nParliament, Paine lays the responsibility firmly at the king\u2019s\ndoor. And he appeals to a sense among Americans that they have all the\nresources, and every claim, to rule themselves without the\ninterference and control of a body half-way around the world.\nSubverting paternalist metaphors for Britain\u2019s colonial claims,\nPaine creates an image of a nation come of age, ready for freedom from\nits leading strings, having every justification for separation from\nits unnatural parent, and seeking to stand on its own as a commercial\nrepublic, trading in its own right. It is not America who is behaving\nunnaturally and ungratefully, but the \u2018royal brute of Great\nBritain.\u2019 \u2018Nature has deserted the connection, and art\ncannot supply her place\u2019 (CW I, 23).\n\nAmericans do not see the way forward, but it is simple. The colonies\nneed to be divided into districts, districts should elect their\nrepresentatives to Congress, and Congress should choose a President by\nballot from the delegates of each state in turn, with the first state\nbeing chosen by lot. To avoid injustice, three fifths should be\nrequired for a majority. To avoid imposing his views, however, he\nsuggests that each state nominate two members to a Continental\nCongress to frame a charter fixing the details of the\ngovernment\u2014\u2018always remembering that our strength is\ncontinental, not provincial\u2019 (CW I, 29). And in a rare citation\nof another\u2019s works, Paine appeals to Dragonetti\u2019s adage\nthat the aim should be \u2018a mode of government that should combine\nthe greatest sum of individual happiness with the least national\nexpense\u2019 (CW I, 29).\n\nFor all its success, Common Sense is not without flaws. It\ncontains a digression on biblical accounts of the origin of monarchy;\nits powerful rhetoric leaves unanswered a range of more practical and\ntheoretical questions, and the argument jumps around considerably.\nLater editions added an appendix denouncing the Quakers for their\nquietism. But its rhetorical effectiveness cannot be\ndoubted\u2014which suggests that it intersected powerfully with the\nconcerns and beliefs that were widespread in colonial America at the\npoint of rupture. Political theorists might want to press for more\ndetails about who will have the vote; about whether there is an\nimplicit acceptance of a doctrine of the fall; about the extent to\nwhich his appeals to republics envisage a degree of republican civic\nvirtue; about whether the argument is based on an account of natural\nrights; and so on. But on such issues the pamphlet is either silent or\nonly barely suggestive. Unlike Locke, this is not a principled\njustification for resistance, so much as a concatenation of points\nabout Americans taking their collective identity and independent\ninterests seriously and separating from the increasingly arbitrary\nrule of Britain. Given these sweeping claims, it is easy to see why so\nmany commentators have held that Paine was both lacking in\nintellectual sophistication and basically held to a consistent set of\nprinciples throughout his work, since it is difficult to demonstrate\nthat much he says is actively inconsistent with what he later wrote.\nNonetheless, if we take increasing precision in his claims as evidence\nof greater attention to issues that he felt he could confidently sweep\npast in Common Sense, then a case for a deepening of his\nthinking and for a process of change over time can be made.\n",
