    "main_text": "Marriage Equality\n6. Marriage Equality\n\nAmong the most highly contested civil rights issues of recent years\nhas been the question of whether marriage laws should be extended to\ninclude same-sex couples. Over the past two decades, a number of\ncountries have liberalized their laws to enable such couples to become\nmarried, despite the opposition of those who think that it is morally\nor theologically unjustified to alter the traditional understanding of\nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman. The countries that\ncurrently recognize same-sex marriages include the Netherlands,\nBelgium, Canada, South Africa, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Mexico,\nPortugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, Brazil, France, England, New\nZealand, and the United States. In most of these countries, nationwide\nsame-sex marriage was brought about by legislation. But in the United\nStates, the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges\n(2015) extended same-sex marriage from ten states to all fifty.\n\nMost scholars working in the areas of philosophy and legal theory\nendorse a principle of equal treatment for same-sex and heterosexual\ncouples and argue that equal treatment requires that same-sex\nmarriages be legalized (Wardle 1996; Eskridge 1996; Balkin 2020).\nHowever, there are dissenting voices in the literature, rejecting\nmarriage equality. These voices do not argue in favor the traditional\npractice of criminalizing same-sex relations, although some contend\nthat such relations are \u201cmanifestly unworthy of the human being\nand immoral\u201d (Finnis 1996: 14). But they all argue that\nextending marriage to same-sex couples flouts important values and\nprinciples.\n\nMany advocates of a right to same-sex marriage argue that abridging a\nperson\u2019s right to marry on the basis of sexual orientation is\nobjectionable for the same reasons that abridging that right on the\nbasis of race cannot be justified: both forms of restriction are\narbitrary deprivations of a fundamental civil right (Koh et al.:\n18\u201319 and 42). However, such an argument proceeds too\nquickly. In the eyes of opponents, the analogy between race and sexual\norientation is inapt: the considerations they invoke against same-sex\nmarriage, such as the interests of children or the distinctive nature\nof heterosexual intercourse, do not apply to interracial\nmarriages. Accordingly, arguments about same-sex marriage must engage\nwith those considerations.\n\nFinnis (1996), Lee (1997) and George (1997) make their case against\nsame-sex marriage by invoking natural law. However, unlike traditional\nversions of natural law theory, their version does not rest on any\nexplicit theological or metaphysical claims. Rather, it invokes\nindependent principles of practical reasoning that articulate the\nbasic reasons for action. Such reasons are the fundamental goods that\naction is capable of realizing and, for Finnis, Lee and George,\ninclude \u201cmarriage, the conjuntio of man and woman\u201d (Finnis\n1996: 4). Homosexual conduct, masturbation, and all extra-marital sex\naim strictly at \u201cindividual gratification\u201d and can be no\npart of any \u201ccommon good.\u201d Such actions \u201charm the\ncharacter\u201d of those voluntarily choosing them (Lee and George,\n1997: 135), and, in taking the actions, the individual becomes a slave\nto his passions, allowing his reason to be overridden by his raw\ndesire for sensuous pleasure.\n\nOn Finnis\u2019s account, when consensual sexual conduct is private,\ngovernment may not outlaw it, but government \u201ccan rightly judge\nthat it has a compelling interest in denying that \u2018gay\nlifestyles\u2019 are a valid and humanly acceptable choice and form\nof life\u201d (1996: 17). And for Finnis, Lee and George, equal\ntreatment of same-sex and heterosexual relations is out of the\nquestion due to the morally defective character of same-sex\nrelations.\n\nMacedo responds to Finnis by arguing that \u201call of the goods that\ncan be shared by sterile heterosexual couples can also be shared by\ncommitted homosexual couples\u201d (1996: 39). Macedo points out that\nFinnis does not condemn sexual intercourse by sterile heterosexual\ncouples. But Finnis replies that there is a relevant difference\nbetween homosexual couples and sterile heterosexual ones: the latter\nbut not the former are united \u201cbiologically\u201d when they\nhave intercourse. Lee and George make essentially the same point: only\nheterosexual couples can \u201ctruly become one body, one\norganism\u201d (1997: 150). But Macedo points out that, biologically,\nit is not the man and woman who unite but the sperm and the egg (1996:\n37). It can be added that the \u201cbiological unity\u201d argument\nseems to run contrary to Finnis\u2019s claim that his position\n\u201cdoes not seek to infer normative conclusions from non-normative\n(natural-fact) premises\u201d (1997: 16). More importantly, Macedo\nand Koppelman make the key point that the human good realized in\nintimate relations is a function of \u201cmutual commitment and\nstable engagement\u201d (Macedo, 1996: 40) and that same-sex couples\ncan achieve \u201cthe precise kind of human good\u201d that is\navailable to heterosexual ones (Koppelman, 1997: 1649). Accordingly,\nequal treatment under the law for same-sex couples, including the\nrecognition of same-sex marriage, would remove unjustifiable obstacles\nfaced by those couples to the achievement of that human good.\n\nCorvino explains one of the central human goods provided by marriage\nin this way: marriage involves two individuals mutually and publicly\ncommitting to be the \u201cNumber One Person\u201d for the other in\nsharing the benefits and alleviating the burdens that life brings\n(Corvino and Gallagher: 15). Sterile heterosexual couples and those\nunable to have sexual relations for physical reasons are rightly\npermitted to marry to secure that good, and Corvino argues that\n\u201conce the state provides marriage as an option for different-sex\npartners, even if they cannot or choose not to have children; \u2026\n[and] even if they are incapable of coitus, \u2026 but then denies\n[marriage] to same-sex couples, it is treating citizens\nunequally\u201d (89\u201390).\n\nGallagher rejects Corvino\u2019s view, contending that \u201c[t]he\ncritical public or \u2018civil\u2019 task of marriage is to regulate\nsexual relationships between men and women in order to reduce the\nlikelihood that children \u2026 will face the burdens of\nfatherlessness, and increase the likelihood that there will be a next\ngeneration that will be raised by their mothers and fathers in one\nfamily, where both parents are committed to each other and to their\nchildren\u201d (Corvino and Gallagher: 96). She argues that\n\u201cgay marriage is a profound change to the meaning of the word\n\u2018marriage\u2019\u2026 . [b]ecause] it disconnects marriage\nfrom its grounding in the human reality that male-female sexual\nrelationships are different from other kinds of relationships\u201d\n(101).\n\nHowever, Gallagher is not correct to claim that Corvino\u2019s view\nrests on the premise that \u201ca union of two men or two women is\njust the same as a union of husband and wife\u201d (132). The\nquestion is whether the two sorts of union are relevantly similar with\nrespect to values that marriage serves. Corvino claims that, with\nrespect to at least one important value, viz., providing support for\ncouples who want to undertake a mutual and public commitment to be\neach other\u2019s \u201cNumber One Person,\u201d there is no\nrelevant difference. Gallagher weakens her own view when she writes\nthat \u201cgay marriage is wrong first and foremost not because of\nits consequences but because it is a lie\u201d (178), specifically,\nthe lie that same-sex couples \u201care like man and wife\u201d\n(177). Rather, in light of her emphasis on how marriage protects\nchildren (109\u2013115), it would make more sense for her to argue that\nregulating sexual relations between men and women in the interest of\nchildren is the most important social purpose of marriage and that\nmarriage equality threatens the capacity of marriage to serve that\nfunction; she should not deny that marriage has other, socially\nvaluable functions.\n\nCorvino affirms that marriage has an important child-protection\nfunction, while rejecting the idea that it is the sole function (192).\nHis key disagreements with Gallagher are over the importance of those\nother functions and whether there is adequate reason to think that\nmarriage equality threatens the child-protection function. Corvino\nargues that denying same-sex couples access to the human goods that\nmarriage can provide to them is no small matter for those couples and\nthat Gallagher vastly underestimates what such access means to them\n(198). Given how persistently and vigorously same-sex couples have\nfought for marriage equality, it is difficult to disagree with Corvino\non the matter.\n\nCiting studies suggesting that male same-sex couples have a relatively\nweak commitment to sexual fidelity and are relatively unconcerned\nabout their partner having sex outside of the relationship, Gallagher\nargues that same-sex marriage would dilute the commitment to fidelity\namong heterosexual couples, thereby undermining an essential marital\nnorm. And, with the fidelity norm seriously weakened, heterosexual\nmarriages would become more unstable and the interests of children\nwould be harmed.\n\nIn Corvino\u2019s judgment, however, Gallagher\u2019s argument rests\non an \u201cimplausible empirical claim about same-sex couples\u2019\npower to topple majority norms\u201d (195). Gay marriages would be\nonly a tiny fraction of all marriages, and gay marriages between men\nwho are indifferent to fidelity would be an even smaller fraction. One\ncould add to Corvino\u2019s criticism that, even if Gallagher\u2019s\nclaim is not implausible, it does seem to be little more than\nspeculation, and it is problematic to deny a civil right on such\nspeculative grounds to a portion of the adult population that has made\nit clear that, contra Gallagher, the right is very important\nto them. Gallagher might respond that the stakes for society are high,\nclaiming that the well-being of future generations hang in the\nbalance. But essentially the same claims have been made by defenders\nof traditional marriage about every liberalization of the law of\nmarriage, from the dismantling of coverture (which had placed a\nmarried woman almost entirely under the legal power of her husband) to\nthe present controversy over same-sex marriage.\n\nGirgis, Anderson, and George argue that the defense of same-sex\nmarriage rests on a faulty understanding of marriage, what they call\n\u201cthe revisionist view\u201d (4). Such a view derives from the\nsexual revolution of the 1960\u2019s and rejects the understanding\nthat had prevailed in almost every society until then, \u201cthe\nconjugal view\u201d (3).\n\nOn the conjugal view, marriage is a permanent commitment,\n\u201cordered to procreation and family life\u201d (7) and\nconstituting a \u201ccomprehensive union\u201d of a man and a woman.\nThe union joins spouses \u201cin body as well as in mind\u201d and\nis \u201csealed by sexual intercourse\u201d (3). Such a union is\n\u201ca basic human good, a distinctive way of thriving\u201d (35).\nAnd \u201cthere is something special\u201d about a marital\ncouple\u2019s sexual intercourse, because it constitutes the\n\u201chighest kind of bodily unity\u201d (26), a unity not available\nin any other relationship. In having intercourse, the marital partners\n\u201cdo not merely touch or interlock\u201d but unite in a way that\n\u201chas generative significance\u201d and \u201cphysically\nembodies their specific, marital commitment\u201d (36). By contrast,\nthe revisionist view regards marriage as essentially a matter of\n\u201cemotional union and cohabitation\u201d (8). Sex can enhance\nthe emotional connections but is not essential to the marital union,\nand when the emotions cool, the partners might reasonably seek to end\nthe union.\n\nGirgis et al. claim that the revisionist view warps our grasp of what\nmarriage is. They dismiss Corvino\u2019s idea that marriage is a\nmatter of having a \u201cNumber One Person,\u201d arguing that it\n\u201ccannot distinguish marriage from simple companionship\u201d\n(15). Nor can the revisionist view explain why the state should be\ninvolved in regulating marriage or account for the central marital\nnorms of permanence and sexual exclusivity.\n\nCorvino can respond that his defense of marriage equality does not\nrest on the revisionist position, even though he does reject the\nconjugal view. Rather, Corvino is suggesting a way of understanding\nmarriage that gives same-sex partners access to those substantial\ngoods of marriage that are not tied to heterosexual intercourse.\nSecurity in a stable relationship that is publicly and legally\nratified as lasting and exclusive is among those goods. The liberty to\nbreak off a relationship when emotions \u201ccool\u201d is no part\nof Corvino\u2019s understanding of marriage. And although it is true\nthat companionship and friendship can provide a \u201cNumber One\nPerson,\u201d they cannot do so with the same level of assurance that\na legally ratified marriage can.\n\nGirgis et al. might reject Corvino\u2019s view on the ground that it\nrests on mere psychological considerations related to such matters as\nhow secure individuals feel and how likely they are to end a\nrelationship if it is sexually open, whereas their view rests on a\npriori principles concerning objective human goods. However,\nCorvino can respond that his understanding of marriage invokes human\ngoods that are no less objective than Girgis\u2019s\n\u201ccomprehensive union.\u201d Additionally, Corvino might note\nthat, even assuming that heterosexual intercourse unites male and\nfemale partners, his argument proceeds without recourse to such\ncontestable claims as the quasi-metaphysical thesis that such\nintercourse between married partners is \u201cthe highest\u201d form\nof bodily unity and that other sorts of sexual activity are a\n\u201cmere\u201d touching or interlocking of bodily parts.\n\nGirgis et al. think that the conjugal account of marriage reflects its\ntrue nature, but this position appears to have been rejected by most\ndemocratic societies since the liberalization of marriage laws and\nnorms that began with nineteenth-century criticisms of the law of\ncoverture. Blackstone summarized the law as it had been through the\n18th century: \u201cBy marriage, the husband and wife are one person\nin law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is\nsuspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and\nconsolidated into that of the husband\u201d (441). Over the course of\na century and more, coverture was limited and eventually eliminated in\nfavor of marriage equality between husband and wife, though\ntraditionalists repeatedly argued that such changes violated the\nessence of marriage as \u201ca union of person in husband and\nwife\u201d (441). Subsequent changes in the social understanding of\nmarriage were reflected in the rejection of the requirement of sexual\nintercourse for the consummation of marriage and in the spread of\nno-fault divorce laws. Given that such radical changes in the\nunderstanding of marriage have already taken place and been inscribed\nin law, it is unclear how law and society can now consistently or\njustly exclude same-sex couples from forming a marital bond.\n",
