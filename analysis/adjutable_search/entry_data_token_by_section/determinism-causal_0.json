    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn most of what follows, I will speak simply of determinism,\nrather than of causal determinism. This follows philosophical\npractice of sharply distinguishing views and theories of what\ncausation is from any conclusions about the success or failure of\ndeterminism (cf. Earman, 1986; an exception is Mellor 1994). \n\nTraditionally determinism has been given various, usually imprecise\ndefinitions. This is only problematic if one is investigating\ndeterminism in a specific, well-defined theoretical context; but it is\nimportant to avoid certain major errors of definition. In order to get\nstarted we can begin with a loose and (nearly) all-encompassing\ndefinition as follows:\n\nDeterminism: Determinism is true of the world if and only if,\ngiven a specified way things are at a time t, the way things\ngo thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural\nlaw.\n\n\nThe italicized phrases are elements that require further explanation\nand investigation, in order for us to gain a clear understanding of\nthe concept of determinism.\n\nThe notion of determinism may be seen as one way of cashing out a\nhistorically important nearby idea: the idea that everything can,\nin principle, be explained, or that everything that is, has a\nsufficient reason for being and being as it is, and not otherwise,\ni.e., Leibniz\u2019s Principle of Sufficient Reason.\nLeibniz\u2019s PSR, however, is not linked to physical laws;\narguably, one way for it to be satisfied is for God to will\nthat things should be just so and not otherwise. This does not\nrequire that physical or causal determinism hold. On the other hand,\non a strict reading Leibniz\u2019s PSR may be more demanding than\ndeterminism. Under determinism, particular facts and events are the\nway they are due to the laws and the particular facts of how things\nstood at an earlier time, for example at the beginning of time. But\nthere need be no answer to the question \u201cWhy were things just\nso at the beginning of time?\u201d, and hence no\ncomplete sufficient reason for all facts and\n events.[1]\n\nSince the first clear articulations of the concept of determinism,\nthere has been a tendency among philosophers to believe in the truth\nof some sort of determinist doctrine. There has also been a tendency,\nhowever, to confuse determinism proper with two related notions:\npredictability and fate.\n\nFatalism is the thesis that all events (or in some versions, at least\nsome events) are destined to occur no matter what we do. The source of\nthe guarantee that those events will happen is located in the will of\nthe gods, or their divine foreknowledge, or some intrinsic\nteleological aspect of the universe, rather than in the unfolding of\nevents under the sway of natural laws or cause-effect relations.\nFatalism is therefore clearly separable from determinism, at least to\nthe extent that one can disentangle mystical forces and gods\u2019\nwills and foreknowledge (about specific matters) from the\nnotion of natural/causal law. Not every metaphysical picture makes\nthis disentanglement possible, of course. But as a general matter, we\ncan imagine that certain things are fated to happen, without this\nbeing the result of deterministic natural laws alone; and we can\nimagine the world being governed by deterministic laws, without\nanything at all being fated to occur (perhaps because there\nare no gods, nor mystical/teleological forces deserving the titles\nfate or destiny, and in particular no intentional\ndetermination of the \u201cinitial conditions\u201d of the world).\nIn a looser sense, however, it is true that under the assumption of\ndeterminism, one might say that given the way things have\ngone in the past, all future events that will in fact happen are\nalready destined to occur.\n\nPrediction and determinism are also easy to disentangle, barring\ncertain strong theological commitments. As the following famous\nexpression of determinism by Laplace shows, however, the two are also\neasy to commingle:\n\nWe ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of\nits antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow.\nAn intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given\ninstant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the\nuniverse, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the\nmotions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the\nworld, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to\nsubject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the\nfuture as well as the past would be present to its eyes. The\nperfection that the human mind has been able to give to astronomy\naffords but a feeble outline of such an intelligence. (Laplace 1820)\n\n\nIn this century,\n Karl Popper (1982)\n defined determinism in terms of predictability also, in his book\nThe Open Universe.\n\nLaplace probably had God in mind as the powerful intelligence to whose\ngaze the whole future is open. If not, he should have: 19th\nand 20th century mathematical studies showed convincingly\nthat neither a finite, nor an infinite but embedded-in-the-world\nintelligence can have the computing power necessary to predict the\nactual future, in any world remotely like ours. But even if our aim is\nonly to predict a well-defined subsystem of the world, for a limited\nperiod of time, this may be impossible for any reasonable finite agent\nembedded in the world, as many studies of chaos (sensitive dependence\non initial conditions) show. Conversely, certain parts of the world\ncould be highly predictable, in some senses, without the\nworld being deterministic. When it comes to predictability of future\nevents by humans or other finite agents in the world, then,\npredictability and determinism are simply not logically connected at\nall.\n\nThe equation of \u201cdeterminism\u201dwith\n\u201cpredictability\u201d is therefore a fa\u00e7on de\nparler that at best makes vivid what is at stake in determinism:\nour fears about our own status as free agents in the world. In\nLaplace\u2019s story, a sufficiently bright demon who knew how things\nstood in the world 100 years before my birth could predict every\naction, every emotion, every belief in the course of my life. Were she\nthen to watch me live through it, she might smile condescendingly, as\none who watches a marionette dance to the tugs of strings that it\nknows nothing about. We can\u2019t stand the thought that we are (in\nsome sense) marionettes. Nor does it matter whether any demon (or even\nGod) can, or cares to, actually predict what we will do: the existence\nof the strings of physical necessity, linked to far-past\nstates of the world and determining our current every move, is what\nalarms us. Whether such alarm is actually warranted is a question well\noutside the scope of this article (see Hoefer (2002a), Ismael (2016)\nand the entries on\n free will\n and\n incompatibilist theories of freedom).\n But a clear understanding of what determinism is, and how we might be\nable to decide its truth or falsity, is surely a useful starting point\nfor any attempt to grapple with this issue. We return to the issue of\nfreedom in section 6,\n Determinism and Human Action,\n below.\n",
