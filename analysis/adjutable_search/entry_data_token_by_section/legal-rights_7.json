    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Function and Value || The Will Theory\n4.1 The Will Theory\n\nAccording to the Will (or Choice) Theory, rights provide right-holders\na measure of normative control over themselves or others, functioning\nto make right-holders \u201csmall-scale sovereign[s]\u201d over\ncertain domains (Hart 1982: 183; 1983: 35). Most prominently,\nright-holders control as a matter of choice the duties owed to them by\nothers, holding the Hohfeldian power to annul, waive, enforce, or\ntransfer such duties (Hart 1982: 183\u20134). The Will Theory also\nfits with Hohfeldian privileges, providing options for how one may\nchoose to act or to exercise one\u2019s powers (MacCormick 1977:\n193\u2013194). Moreover, claim-rights and immunities function to\nprotect the free exercise of such privileges (Hart 1982: 172; Simmonds\n1998: 218\u2013220) and powers. Prominent proponents of the Will\nTheory include Kant, Hart, Wellman, Steiner, Sumner, and\nRipstein.\n\nThe branch of law most hospitable to the Will Theory is private law.\nBe it the law of contract, property, torts, or trusts, right-holders\ntypically wield considerable\u2014although by no means\ncomplete\u2014control over Hohfeldian positions that they stand in in\nrelation to others. For instance, within limits and subject to various\nexceptions, holders of private law rights are empowered to waive\ncompliance with certain obligations owed to them, forgo remedial\nrights, and annul or transfer some such claims, as well as certain\nprivate law powers, liberties, and immunities (see, e.g., Stevens\n2007: 17\u201319). \n\nFrom a justificatory perspective, emphasizing right-holders\u2019\nchoice and control, the Will Theory stresses the affinity between\nrights and values that are related to an individual\u2019s control\nover his/her lives, including personal liberty, self-realization,\nagency, and autonomy. Thereby demonstrating how rights can neatly fit\npolitical moralities concerned with such values (Kramer 1998: 75;\nSumner 1987: 47). \n\nThat said, coupling claim-rights and powers over those claims (and\ntheir correlative duties) can also make rights attractive to certain\npolitical moralities that, at best, value human agency, autonomy, and\nfreedom not intrinsically, but instrumentally (Kramer 1998:\n76\u201377). For instance, viewing law as a vehicle for wealth\nmaximization invites markets in legal entitlements, thereby requiring\nthe liberty and power to waive and transfer rights. \n\nArguably, the justificatory virtues of rights as fleshed out by the\nWill Theory can be subsumed under the Interest Theory. If so, this is\nbecause values such as autonomy, freedom, and control secured by\nholding power over the duties owed to one, are arguably themselves in\nthe interest of right-holders (MacCormick 1977: 207\u2013208; Raz\n1994: 149\u201350; Kramer 2001: 61; Edmundson 2004: 127). \n",
