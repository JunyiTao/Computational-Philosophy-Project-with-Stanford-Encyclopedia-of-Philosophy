    "main_text": "Indexicality and propositional content\n3. Indexicality and propositional content\n\nHowever, as Husserl was well aware, the species-theory of content\nfaces at least one serious objection. This objection concerns\nutterances that are \u201cessentially occasional\u201d, i.e.,\nsystematically context-sensitive, expressions like \u201cI am here\nnow\u201d and the \u2018indexical\u2019 experiences they give voice\nto. If the intentional content of an indexical experience is to serve\nas a (sub-)propositional content, it must uniquely determine the\nobject (if any) that the respective experience refers to. That is to\nsay: if two indexical experiences display the same intentional\ncontent, they must refer to the same object (if any). It seems,\nthough, that the moments of matter of two such experiences can\ninstantiate the same ideal matter\u2014the same type of (particular)\ncontent\u2014whilst representing different objects. If you and I both\nthink \u201cI am here\u201d, our respective thoughts share the same\ntype of content, or so it would seem, but they represent different\nstates of affairs. In order to accommodate this observation, Husserl\ndraws a distinction between, on the one hand, the \u201cgeneral\nmeaning function\u201d of an utterance (which corresponds to what\nDavid Kaplan calls \u201ccharacter\u201d, roughly: the linguistic\nmeaning of the expression used) and, on the other hand, the\n\u201crespective meaning\u201d (i.e., the propositional or\nsub-propositional content expressed in the relevant context of\nutterance). However, it is doubtful whether this distinction really\nhelps Husserl overcome the difficulty the phenomenon of\ncontext-sensitivity poses for his species-theory of content. If\nintentional contents are ideal matters in the sense of types\nof particular matters, and if this kind of type may remain constant\nwhile the intentional object and hence the (sub-)propositional content\ndiffers, then surely intentional contents thus conceived cannot always\nfunction as (sub-)propositional contents, as Husserl\u2019s theory\nwould have it. Rather, there must be another intentional content\ninvolved, namely the \u201crespective meaning\u201d, which serves as\nthe (sub-)propositional content of the indexical experience. And this\ncontent does not appear to be an ideal species. (It may be\nargued, however, that even (sub-)propositional contents of indexical\nutterances can be instantiated multiply in thought and\nspeech, thus qualifying as ideal species after all. But the crucial\nquestion is whether this holds true in complete generality: consider\nthe above example \u201cI am here now\u201d.)\n\nHowever that may be, Husserl construes (sub-)propositional contents\n(\u201crespective meanings\u201d) as two-factored, with the general\nmeaning function plus the relevant context of utterance (if any)\ndetermining the content in question. And at least in the case of\nindexical experiences he seems to identify their intentional contents\nwith these two-factored contents, for he holds that intentional\ncontent, which is referred to as \u201cnoematic sense\u201d or\n\u201cnoematic nucleus\u201d in Ideas, uniquely determines\nreference, i.e., intentional object. (For the claim that noematic\nsense is contextually determined respective meaning rather than\ngeneral meaning function\u2014which rules out any internalist\nreading; see Section 4 below\u2014cf. Husserliana, vol.\nXX/1, pp. 74\u201378; see also Husserliana, vol. XXVI, p.\n212, fn.) Some scholars even go as far as to claim that Husserl\ndefines the noematic sense as \u201ca certain person, object, event,\nstate of affairs which presents itself, taken exactly as it present\nitself or as it is intended\u201d (Gurwitsch 1982, pp. 61 f.; cp.\nSokolowski 1987 and Drummond 1992; for a much-discussed critique of\nGurwitsch\u2019s interpretation see F\u00f8llesdal 1969). The\nnotion of an intentional object \u201cas it is intended\u201d is\nalready introduced in LI. It is argued (in LI V, sec. 20) that the\nobject (e.g. the situation of affairs) as it is intended is to be\ndistinguished from the (sub-)propositional content, on the grounds\nthat, for instance, the state of affairs judged (the situation of\naffairs as it is categorically formed in the judgment) exists iff it\nobtains (so that the judgment is true), whilst the propositional\ncontent judged exists even if it is false (cf. Husserliana,\nvol. XIX/1, 427).\n",
