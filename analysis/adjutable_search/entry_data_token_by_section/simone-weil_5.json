    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n6. Aesthetics\n\nWeil\u2019s metaphysic sheds light on her aesthetic philosophy, which\nis primarily Kantian and Platonic. For Weil beauty is a snare\n(\u00e0 la Homer) set by God, trapping the soul so that God\nmight enter it. Necessity presents itself not only in gravity, time,\nand affliction, but also in beauty. The contact of impersonal good\nwith the faculty of sense is beauty; contact of evil with the faculty\nof sense is ugliness and suffering\u2014both are contact with the\nreal, necessary, and providential.\n\nWeil is a realist in regard to aesthetics in that she uses the\nlanguage of being gripped or grasped by beauty, which weaves, as it\nwere, a link among mind, body, world, and universe. Woven through the\nworld, but beyond relying simply on the individual\u2019s mind or\nsenses, beauty, in this linking, lures and engenders awareness of\nsomething outside of the self. In paradoxical terms, for Weil,\nfollowing Kant, the aesthetic experience can be characterized as a\ndisinterested interestedness; against Kant, her telos of such\nexperience is Platonic, namely, to orient the soul to the\ncontemplation of the good. Moreover, for Weil beauty is purposive only\nbecause it is derivative of the good, i.e., the order of the world is\na function of God. In a revision of Kant\u2019s line that beauty is a\nfinality without finality, then, she sees beauty not only as a kind of\nfeeling or presence of finality, but also as a gesture toward,\ninclination to, or promise of supernatural, transcendental\ngoodness.\n\nAt the same time, Weil\u2019s concept of beauty is not only informed\nby her Platonism and thus marked by eternity, but it is also inspired\nby her experiences with Christ and hence features a kind of\nincarnation: the ideal can become a reality in the world. As such,\nbeauty is a testament to and manifestation of the network of\ninflexible necessity that is the natural world\u2014a network that,\nin some sense, the intelligence can grasp. It is in this way\u2014not\nas an ontological category but, rather, as a sensible\nexperience\u2014that through beauty necessity becomes the object of\nlove (i.e., in Kantian terms, beauty is regulative, not constitutive).\nThus beauty is metaxu (an intermediary) attracting the soul\nto God, and as metaxu, beauty serves as a \u201clocus of\nincommensurability\u201d (Winch 1989: 173) between the fragile\ncontingency of time (change, becoming, death) and an eternal\nreality.\n\nBecause beauty is the order of the world as necessity, strictly\nspeaking, \u201cbeauty\u201d applies principally to the world as a\nwhole, and therefore consent to beauty must be total. Thus the love of\nbeauty functions as an \u201cimplicit love of God\u201d [see WFG\n99]. More specifically, on the level of the particular there are,\nsecondarily, types of beauty that nevertheless demonstrate balance,\norder, proportion, and thus their divine provenance (e.g., those found\nin nature, art, and science).\n\nOne\u2019s recognition of the beauty/order of the world has\nimplications, once again, for the subject. Because beauty is to be\ncontemplated at a distance and not consumed through the greedy will,\nit trains the soul to be detached in the face of something\nirreducible, and in this sense it is similar to affliction. Both\nde-center the self and demand a posture of waiting (attente).\nContemplating beauty, then, means transcending the perspective of\none\u2019s own project. Because beauty, as external to self, is to be\nconsented to, it implies both that one\u2019s reality is limited and\nthat one does not want to change the object of her/his mode of\nengagement. Furthermore, beauty has an element of the impersonal\ncoming into contact with a person. Real interaction with beauty is\ndecreative. True to this idea, Weil\u2019s aesthetic commitments are\nreflected in her style: in her sharp prose she scrutinizes her own\nthought while tending to exclude her own voice and avoid personal\nreferences; thus she performs \u201cthe linguistic decreation of the\nself\u201d (Dargan 1999: 7).\n",
