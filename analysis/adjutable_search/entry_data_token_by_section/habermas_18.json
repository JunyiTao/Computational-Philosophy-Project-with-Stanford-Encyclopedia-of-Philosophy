The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms\n\nBetween Facts and Norms is a legal and political theory\nfocused on the ways in which constitutional democracies produce and\ninstitutionalize democratically legitimate law. As Habermas wrote and\nresearched the book in the late 80s and early 90s, political theory\nwas in the grip of the debate between liberalism of a Rawlsian or\nKantian stripe, and communitarianism, or as Habermas preferred to call\nit Neo-Aristotelianism. In Between Facts and Norms he\nattempts to mediate between these two opposed approaches to political\ntheory. He does this by setting out and defending the thesis of the\nequiprimordiality (or co-originality) of liberal rights and popular\nsovereignty, and their correlative values of individual and collective\nautonomy.\n\nOne of the basic ideas in Between Facts and Norms is that the\nrule of law, and indeed\u2014though this is implied not\nstated\u2014legitimate liberal constitutional states, cannot exist\nwithout radical democracy (1992b [1996b: xlii]). But at the same time\nradical democracy has to be made compatible with the exigencies of\nlarge scale administrative and bureaucratic states organized through\nlaw. At the same time Habermas also tries to locate and defend the\ncommon ground between legal positivists, like Austin, and normativists\nlike Dworkin and Rawls. He does this by identifying and rationally\nreconstructing the \u201cnormative self-understanding\u201d of the\nlegal system as embodied in\n\n\nparticles and fragments of an \u201cexisting reason\u201d already\nincorporated in existing practices. (1992b [1996b: 287])\n\n\nHabermas does not oppose the ideal, but attempts to reconstruct\nidealizations embodied in existing practices, and set these in play\nwithout relying on the optimistic providential assumptions of the\nphilosophy of history. The practices he has in mind are legislative\npractices, and the \u201cparticles of existing reason\u201d consist\nin the various ways in which discourse is built into those practices.\nIn short Habermas reconstructs and describes the ways in which\ndiscourse is institutionalized by political and legal systems. Thus\nhis approach is a hybrid between the sociology of law and\njurisprudence, and normative political philosophy. The approach is\ncaptured by the title Faktizit\u00e4t und Geltung (literally\n\u201cFacticity and Validity\u201d), or Between Facts and\nNorms where the \u201cbetween\u201d designates a complex set of\ninterrelations, rather than a middle ground.\n",
