    "main_text": "Evolution, Development, and Culture || Homology and Development\n1.2 Homology and Development\n\nThere are several approaches to determining what counts as a\nhomologous trait. The \u201cphylogenetic approach\u201d holds that\ntwo traits are homologous when they are derived from a common ancestor\n(Brigandt 2007). Humans and chimpanzees have similar\nphysical-cognitive abilities like tool use (Herrmann et al. 2007).\nUnder the phylogenetic approach, these abilities are homologous\ninsofar as they were inherited from the evolutionary ancestor that\nhumans and chimpanzees shared 6\u20138 million years ago. The\n\u201cdevelopmental approach\u201d to homology holds that two traits\nare homologous when they\u2019re produced by the same developmental\nmodule (Ereshefsky 2012). Mammalian vertebrae, arthropod limbs, and\nbird feathers are often viewed as homologues in this sense. Some hold\nthat homology is best understood as having both phylogenetic and\ndevelopmental components (Ereshefsky 2007, 2012). Under this view, a\ndevelopmental module imposes proximate constraints on how a homologous\ntrait is constructed, while evolution explains why that developmental\nmodule is found across taxa (namely, through common descent).\n\nSome philosophers argue that psychologists should focus on identifying\nhomologous rather than convergent traits, given their interest in the\nmechanisms responsible for behavior (see Matthen 2007; Clark 2010).\nFor example, Paul Griffiths (1997, 2007a, 2007b) argues that\nidentifying cognitive traits as convergent is epistemically more\ndemanding than identifying cognitive traits as homologous.\nExplanations that appeal to convergent evolution often adopt a\nlock-and-key model of adaptation where a trait is viewed as a solution\nto an existing socioecological problem (e.g., episodic-like memory as\na solution to the foraging problem that western scrub jays face\ntoday). However, Griffiths argues that it is unlikely that minds\nevolved in response to contemporary socioecological problems. Instead,\nthe structure and organization of an organism\u2019s phenotype and\nniche coevolve. Moreover, what counts as a \u201cproblem\u201d\ndepends on many factors, such as resource constraints and the\ndevelopmental plasticity of an organism. Griffiths writes:\n\n\nProblems whose solutions cannot be developmentally dissociated must be\nsolved as a single problem and so are not separate problems from the\nstandpoint of adaptive evolution. (2007b: 203)\n\n\nTo provide a compelling case of convergent evolution, one must take\nsuch constraints under account. In the case of complex cognitive\ntraits, researchers often know little about the resource and\ndevelopmental constraints at play in an organism\u2019s evolutionary\nhistory. In this way, identifying cognitive traits as convergent may\nbe epistemically demanding.\n",
