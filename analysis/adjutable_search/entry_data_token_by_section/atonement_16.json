    "main_text": "Classical Theories of the Doctrine of Atonement || Anselm\u2019s Satisfaction Theory\n4.3 Anselm\u2019s Satisfaction Theory\n\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory in Curs Deus Homo (abbr.\nCDH as noted above) is the most influential account of the\nChristian doctrine of atonement. Nearly everything written since\ndefines itself as a defense, development, or rejection of (and\nalternative to) Anselm\u2019s theory.\n\nAnselm\u2019s argument in CDH moves through four steps\n(Thurow 2017b: 433).\n\nStep 1:\nIn order to be saved, humans must offer satisfaction to God for\nwhat they have taken from God in sinning against him.\nStep 2:\nOnly God incarnated as a human descendant of Adam will be able to\noffer adequate satisfaction for human sin.\nStep 3:\nAt least some humans will be saved.\nStep 4:\nBy dying in service of God, God incarnate provides an adequate and\nmost fitting satisfaction for human sin.\n\n\nSteps 1, 2, and 4 give us the heart of Anselm\u2019s theory of\n atonement.[35]\n\nStep 1\n is supported as follows (see CDH I.10\u201314,19,22,24).\nHumans have sinned and sin dishonors God. A just God cannot tolerate\nthe injustice of dishonor, and so sinners must either offer\nsatisfaction that adequately compensates for the dishonor done to God,\nor suffer punishment. But the punishment due for sin against God is\neternal death. Thus, if humans are to be saved from eternal death,\nthey must instead offer adequate satisfaction.\n\nIn support of\n step 2,\n Anselm argues (in short) that humans are so mired in sin, and the\ndisvalue of sin is so great because of God\u2019s nature, that no\nnon-divine human can offer adequate\n satisfaction.[36]\n However, it is \u201cnecessary that the person paying recompense\nshould be identical with the sinner, or a member of the same\nrace\u201d (CDH II.8 [1998: 321]). God\u2014being divine,\nmorally perfect, and having no debt of sin\u2014could offer adequate\nsatisfaction. Thus, adequate satisfaction can only be offered by a\nhuman descendant of Adam who is also God\u2014i.e., God\nincarnate.\n\nFor\n step 4,\n Anselm argues that whatever God incarnate does to satisfy for human\nsin must be supererogatory. Living a perfect life is required of all,\nincluding Christ. But dying in service of God is supererogatory and,\nbecause of the value of God himself, has far greater value than does\nthe debt of human sin (CDH II.10\u201311, 14\u201315).\nFurthermore, this satisfaction is fitting in other ways: it involves\npain (CDH II.11), which counters the pleasure of sin, it\ndecisively conquers Satan (CDH I.22\u201323), and it is a\nbetter example of service to God than one that does not involve his\ndeath (CDH II.18). Anselm here weaves in elements of\nrecapitulation, ransom, and moral influence views. Since God incarnate\nperformed a great act of supererogation for God the Father, he is owed\ncompensation. God incarnate desires the merit of his supererogatory\nact be used as satisfaction for human sin.\n\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory has been criticized on several\ngrounds. Some criticisms conflate the satisfaction theory with penal\nsubstitution and reject both for problems leveled chiefly at penal\nsubstitution (Gorringe 1996, for example). However, Anselm\u2019s\ntheory is notable for saying that God precisely does not punish humans\nfor their sin. Rather, punishment is avoided by Christ\u2019s\nsatisfaction for human sin.\n\nMany object that Anselm\u2019s notion of honor is at heart a feudal\nnotion, both foreign to the Biblical context and not one that we\nshould attribute to God (see Whidden 2011 for\n examples).[37]\n Others have contested this charge, arguing that Anselm\u2019s notion\nof satisfaction has far older roots not connected with feudalism\n(Anderson 2009; Crisp 2020a: 71; Mansini 1987; Whidden 2011) and that\nit fits into his broader metaphysical notion of rectitude\u2014things\nbeing as they should, as rightly ordered, or as morally ordered by God\n(R. Campbell 1998; McGrath 1981).\n\nThe theologian Faustus Socinus is famous for leveling a series of\nobjections against objective theories of the atonement (Grensted\n1920). Two of those objections target satisfaction views specifically.\nFirst, if satisfaction is made for sin, then God does not pardon or\nforgive. But scripture plainly asserts that God forgives humans for\nsin, thus the satisfaction view must be false. This objection,\nhowever, depends upon the debt-canceling view of forgiveness, which\nhas been contested (Pettigrove 2012) and conflicts with other views of\nforgiveness described in\n section 1.3.2.\n Second, Socinus argues that Anselm\u2019s allowance of someone of\nthe same race to make satisfaction for human sin is unmotivated and\ncontrary to our moral standards\u2014the sinner and the sinner alone\nshould pay the price. However, given that for Anselm the\n\u201cprice\u201d seems to be reparative, people other than the\nsinner can help atone by helping repair its harmful effects (Purtill\n1990).\n\nScotus objects to Anselm\u2019s calculation of the infinite debt\nresulting from sin against God. He argues that sin produces a finite\ndebt arising from loving or pursuing a finite thing improperly. Humans\ncan perform supererogatory acts, which they can use as satisfaction to\npay this finite debt (see Burns 1975).\n\nCross (2001) argues that sin against God, when it does not have other\nharmful consequences, is a deprivation of service and one only need\ngenuinely apologize and repent to atone in such cases. One must repair\nharmful consequences to humans, but beyond that no further reparation\nis owed to\n God.[38]\n\nStump (2018) objects that Anselm (and many other views) regards\nGod\u2019s forgiveness as conditional upon and responsive to\nChrist\u2019s satisfaction for human sin. This, she claims, is\ncontrary to God\u2019s love, which entails unconditional and\nunilateral forgiveness. Some have objected to Stump\u2019s view of\nGod\u2019s love and forgiveness (Craig 2019; J. Rutledge 2022;\nSwinburne 2019; Thurow & Strabbing 2020; Warmke 2019). Thurow and\nStrabbing (2020) argue that Anselm\u2019s notion of forgiveness is\ndifferent from Stump\u2019s and, in any case, Anselm is more\nconcerned to argue that reconciliation is conditional upon\nsatisfaction.\n\nLombardo (2013) objects that Anselm is committed to saying that God\nwills Christ\u2019s death and the moral evil that causes his death,\nneither of which a good God would do. Anselm tries to dodge this\nconcern in CDH, however Lombardo argues that his attempts all\nfail; they either render his view unable to explain why God became\nhuman or result in a tension within the Trinity.\n\nLastly, many have criticized Anselm\u2019s view for not accounting\nfor how humans are to respond to and adopt Christ\u2019s atoning work\nfor themselves (e.g., Grensted 1920; Crisp 2020a). However, this\nlacuna may be due to the narrow goal of the CDH; Anselm\nelsewhere shows deep sensitivity to the importance of human repentance\nand faith in becoming reconciled to God (Thurow & Strabbing\n 2020).[39]\n\nContemporary defenses of Anselm\u2019s view, or modified\nsatisfactions views, can be found in Anderson 2009; Aspenson 1990;\nFarris & Hamilton 2018; Rogers 2001; Shannon 2009; Sonderegger\n2017 and perhaps most prominently in the work of Richard Swinburne,\nwhich will be discussed in\n section 5.2.\n",
