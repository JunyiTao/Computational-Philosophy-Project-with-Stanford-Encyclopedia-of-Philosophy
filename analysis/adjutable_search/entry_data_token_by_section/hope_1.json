The Philosophical History of Hope\n\nHistorically, evaluations of hope change together with the prevailing\nview of the relationship between human action and the future. As long\nas the human condition is seen as essentially unchangeable, hope is\nmore often treated as arising from mere epistemic uncertainty and as\nhaving ambivalent effects on human happiness. In philosophical\ncontexts where either the possibility of a future life beyond this\nworld or the idea of human progress is emphasized, hope is more often\nseen as an appropriate and even virtuous attitude that enables humans\nto direct their agency towards these possibilities (see Miceli and\nCastelfranchi 2010).\n",
