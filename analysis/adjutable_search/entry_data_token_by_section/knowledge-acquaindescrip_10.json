The\nspeckled hen presents an appearance of, say, 48 speckles. One is, they\nassume, directly acquainted with one\u2019s visual field replete with\nthe 48 speckles. Yet unless one has counted the speckles, one is\nunlikely to have justification for believing that one\u2019s visual\nfield contains the 48 speckles. Even if one guesses correctly the\nnumber of speckles in the field, one\u2019s guess hardly counts as a\njustified belief. Direct acquaintance with truthmakers for one\u2019s\nbelief is, then, clearly not sufficient for noninferential\njustification.\n\nThere are a number of responses available to the acquaintance theorist\n(see BonJour 2003 and Fumerton 2005). It need not be part of the\nacquaintance theorist\u2019s view that in being directly acquainted\nwith an experience one is directly acquainted with all aspects of the\nexperience. One might be directly acquainted with the fact that one is\nbeing appeared to many-speckledly without being acquainted with the\nfact that one is appeared to 48-speckledly. Think, for example, about\nhow you can be aware of a car\u2019s having a dark color without\nbeing aware of its having a determinate shade. Some may deny that\ncases like the latter are clearly possible, for is one not aware of\nthe specific shade as well, even if one does not have a term or\nconcept for it? Indeed, as we have seen, some acquaintance theorists\nhold that one is acquainted with or directly aware of all intrinsic\nsensory or phenomenal features of one\u2019s experience, including\nspecific shades of color. However, they require in addition that the\nsubject attend to the relevant feature or fact, and so they\nare still able to distinguish between a selective, attentive awareness\nand a more minimal consciousness or peripheral awareness. They may\nattempt in this way to accommodate the intuition that we are conscious\nof or aware of a great deal more than we attend to or notice, while\ninsisting that this attention or noticing is a nonjudgmental awareness\nthat secures its object\u2014a form of acquaintance in our sense.\n(See for example, BonJour 2003: 192 and Chalmers 2010: 88, n. 5. See\n section 2\n above for some elaboration.) On this view, one might attend to\none\u2019s being appeared to many-speckledly without attending to\none\u2019s being appeared to 48-speckledly. \n\nOne might also respond that even if one is acquainted with one\u2019s\nbeing appeared to 48-speckledly, one might fail either to have the\nright sort of thought or fail to be directly aware of a correspondence\nrelation holding between this fact and the corresponding thought. It\nmay be that we do not have the simple concepts for such properties,\nand so cannot compare them directly with the contents of experience.\nPerhaps, when one thinks of something\u2019s having 48 speckles, one\ncan think of it, as Russell might say, only by\ndescription (e.g., that number that is picked out by the\nnumeral \u201848\u2019, or by some other description) such that\none\u2019s having the thought does not involve acquaintance with the\nproperty of being 48-speckled. A Russellian about the nature of\nthoughts\n (see section 4)\n might say that we cannot be directly aware of the property\n(universal) of being 48-speckled, and so cannot compare that property\ndirectly with what is experienced. Alternatively, some might say that\nwhile we have phenomenal concepts for color and perhaps some basic\nshapes and numbers, we (most of us anyway) lack the phenomenal concept\nof being 48-speckled (Feldman 2004). On such a view, if my thought\nthat I am appeared to 48-speckledly does not involve such Russellian\nor phenomenal concepts, but rather involves descriptive or complex\ncontents, then it is no surprise that I am not foundationally\njustified in believing that I am appeared to 48-speckledly. \n\nAs long as one has an account of why one of the conditions for\nnoninferential justification fails, one is in a position to respond to\nthe objection.\n",
