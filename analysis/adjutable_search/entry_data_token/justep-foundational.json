The foundationalist\u2019s thesis in\nshort is that (a) there are some \u201cbasic\u201d or\n\u201cfoundational\u201d beliefs that have a positive epistemic\nstatus\u2014e.g., they count as justified or as\nknowledge\u2014without depending on any other beliefs for this\nstatus, and (b) any other beliefs with a positive epistemic status\nmust depend, ultimately, on foundational beliefs for this status. \n\nMany interesting and difficult questions can be raised about the\nrelation between justification and knowledge, including whether\nknowledge should be analyzed in terms of justification, as\nepistemologists traditionally seem to have thought, or whether\nknowledge is prior to or independent of\n justification.[1]\n In what follows we will concentrate on foundationalism about\njustification, though much of what we say also applies to\nfoundationalism about knowledge.\n\nA little reflection suggests that the vast majority of the\npropositions that we know or are justified in believing have that\nstatus only because we know or are justified in believing other\npropositions. So, for example, I am justified in believing that there\nis at least one dog in our neighborhood, because I am justified in\nbelieving that my next door neighbor has a dog; I am justified in\nbelieving that our garbage will get picked up tomorrow, because I am\njustified in believing that tomorrow is Tuesday and that our garbage\ngets picked up every Tuesday; and I am justified in believing that\nthere is going to be at least some rain in the next week, because I am\njustified in believing that the forecast calls for a good deal of\nrain, and that forecasts are almost always right when it comes to\nsimilar short-term forecasts in this area. And the dependence seems to\nbe inferential in nature: in each case, I am justified in believing\nthe former only because I have inferred it, or at least am able to\ninfer it, from the latter. Foundationalists about justification want\nto contrast my foundationally justified belief (knowledge) with a kind\nof justified belief (knowledge) that doesn\u2019t involve the having\nof other justified beliefs (knowledge). There is no standard\nterminology for what we shall henceforth refer to as foundational\njustification\n (knowledge).[2]\n\nWe just noted that the epistemic dependence of one belief on another\nin the above examples seems to be a kind of inferential\ndependence. Epistemologists do tend to assume that all epistemic\ndependence between beliefs is inferential. But perhaps not all\nrelations of epistemic or justificatory dependence between beliefs are\ninferential. When I form an introspective belief about a conscious or\noccurrent belief of mine -- e.g., my belief that I believe it\u2019s\nraining outside -- perhaps (on some views) my second-order\nbelief\u2019s justification depends on my having the conscious belief\nthat it is raining. Many would take such introspective beliefs to be\n\u201cfoundational\u201d, akin to my justification for beliefs about\nmy own present experiences. One way to make sense of this is that even\nif such beliefs depend for their justification on the first-order\nbeliefs, they are foundational in the sense of not depending\npositively on the epistemic or justificatory status of other\nbeliefs. (Notice that my belief that I believe that it is raining\noutside doesn\u2019t depend for its justification on whether I\u2019m\njustified in believing that it\u2019s raining outside.) This suggests\nthat we understand foundational beliefs as those that do not depend on\nthe epistemic status of other beliefs, and non-foundational beliefs as\nbeliefs that do so depend. And if we think that any dependence of a\nbelief on the epistemic status of another belief must be\ninferential, we get the neat result that foundational beliefs\ndo not, but non-foundational beliefs do, depend for their\njustification on inferential relations to other beliefs. But is it\npossible for a belief to depend on the epistemic status of other\nbeliefs, but in a non-inferential way? We will briefly illustrate how\nsome accounts might accept the possibility of non-inferential\nepistemic dependence between beliefs further below, when we discuss\ncoherentism and reliabilism. However, aside from such cases, we will\ntreat \u201cfoundational/nonfoundational\u201d justification and the\n\u201cnoninferential/inferential\u201d justification as\ninterchangeable.\n\nEpistemologists commonly distinguish between doxastic and\npropositional justification. Very roughly, one has\npropositional justification when one has justification (e.g.,\nsome reason or evidence) for belief in a proposition. One has doxastic\njustification when one not only has justification to believe a\nproposition but also believes the proposition and believes it\non the basis of the justification one has. This distinction\napplies to foundational and non-foundational beliefs: being\nfoundationally/non-foundationally justified in believing that P\nrequires having some foundational/non-foundational justification for\nP, and believing that P on the basis of this justification. (While\nthis is to understand doxastic justification in terms of propositional\njustification, some prefer to go the other way round, and understand\nhaving justification in terms of being in a position to acquire\ndoxastic justification. For a helpful discussion, see Turri 2010.) For\nease of exposition, much of our discussion is put in terms that most\nnaturally refer to doxastic justification\u2014e.g., \u201cjustified\nbelief\u201d, \u201cbeing justified in believing\u201d. However,\neven when we use such terms, we focus on propositional justification\n(which is required for doxastic justification) and assume that the\nother conditions involved in believing on a proper basis are\nsatisfied.

Regress Arguments for Foundationalism\n\nA foundationally justified belief (henceforth simply:\n\u2018foundational belief\u2019) is one that does not depend on any\nother beliefs for its justification. According to foundationalism, any\njustified belief must either be foundational or depend for its\njustification, ultimately, on foundational beliefs. Historically,\nfoundationalism was very widely, almost universally accepted.\nAristotle argued that \u201cnot all knowledge is demonstrative\u201d\n(i.e., not all knowledge is based on an argument from other things\nknown), and that some knowledge must be \u201cindependent of\ndemonstration\u201d (Posterior Analytics, I.3). Many of the\nmedieval philosophers seemed in agreement with Aristotle, holding that\nall knowledge must rest on \u201cfirst principles\u201d or\n\u201cself-evident truths\u201d of some sort. More recently,\nDescartes famously held that all knowledge must rest on a secure\nfoundation of indubitable truths (see the entry on\n Descartes\u2019s epistemology).\n Many other philosophers of the early modern period, including Locke,\nLeibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid, all seemed to accept\nfoundationalism as well, despite disagreeing about much else. When an\nargument was implicitly or explicitly offered for the view, it was\nmost often some version of the now famous epistemic regress argument.\n(See Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics, I.3, for an early\nversion of this argument.) Before presenting the argument we should\ndiscuss a principle it depends on.\n\nSuppose I claim to be justified in believing that Fred will die\nshortly and offer as my evidence that Fred has an untreatable and\nserious form of cancer. Concerned, you ask me how I discovered that\nFred has cancer, and I respond that it is just a hunch on my part. As\nsoon as you become convinced (perhaps after further questioning) that\nI have no good reason to suppose that Fred has cancer, you will\nimmediately conclude that my suspicion about Fred\u2019s condition\ngives me no justification for believing that Fred will soon die.\nGeneralizing, one might suggest the following principle:\n\nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust be justified in believing E.\n\nNow consider another example. Suppose I claim to be justified in\nbelieving that Fred will die shortly and offer as my justification\nthat a certain line across his palm (his infamous\n\u201clifeline\u201d) is short. Rightly skeptical, you wonder this\ntime what reason I have for believing that palm lines have anything\nwhatsoever to do with length of life. As soon as you become satisfied\nthat I have no justification for supposing that there is any kind of\nprobabilistic connection between the character of this line and\nFred\u2019s life, you will again reject my claim to have a justified\nbelief about Fred\u2019s impending demise. That suggests that we\nmight expand our principle to include a second clause.\n\nPrinciple of Inferential Justification (PIJ):\n\nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust be (1) justified in believing E, and (2) justified in\nbelieving that E makes probable P.\n\nOne might note that in the palm reading example there actually is no\nsignificant, objective probability between the length of Fred\u2019s\nso-called \u201clife-line\u201d and his life span. Perhaps this is\nwhy my belief that he is going to die soon is unjustified, and not\nthat I don\u2019t satisfy clause (2). Against this, the proponent of\nPIJ might ask us to consider an amendment to the case. Suppose that,\nsurprisingly, it turns out that there is some objective,\nsignificant probabilistic connection between \u201clife-lines\u201d\nand the life spans of the individuals who have them, though again,\nsuppose that I do not have any justification for believing that there\nis such a connection. This possibility seems coherent: the fact that\nthe relevant objective probabilistic relation obtains is not\nsufficient for one to have justification for believing that it\nobtains. But then, intuitively, I remain unjustified in believing that\nFred is going to die soon. Or consider the possibility that I believe\nFred will die because he has just ingested a lot of hemlock, and when\nyou ask me why I think hemlock would lead to death, I say that\nI\u2019m not sure, that it is just a hunch on my part that it is\ngoing to kill him. Again, if I lack justification for believing that\nhemlock is a deadly poison, or that it is likely to have this effect,\nthen intuitively, I lack justification for believing that Fred will\ndie soon. What more, then, is needed? A natural though controversial\nsuggestion is that one must satisfy something like clause (2).[3]\n\nWith the first clause of PIJ, one can present a relatively\nstraightforward epistemic regress argument for foundationalism. That\nclause basically says that one cannot acquire justification for a\nbelief by inferring it from an unjustified belief. It also seems that\none cannot acquire justification for a belief by way of a circular,\ninferential justification\u2014one cannot rely even in part on a\nproposition as a premise in an inference in support of that very\nproposition. We seem left with two options: allow that some beliefs\nhave justification without depending on other beliefs, or suppose that\nall justification is inferential. If all justification is inferential,\nthen for someone S to be justified in believing some\nproposition P, S must be in a position to\nlegitimately infer it from some other proposition E1. But\nE1 could justify S in believing P only if\nS were justified in believing E1, and if all\njustification were inferential, S would have to infer it (or\nat least be able to infer it) from some other proposition justifiably\nbelieved, E2, a proposition which in turn would have to be\ninferred from some other proposition justifiably believed,\nE3, and so on, ad infinitum. But finite beings\ncannot complete an infinitely long chain of reasoning. And so, if all\njustification were inferential, no one could be justified in believing\nanything at all to any extent whatsoever.\n\nThis, however, is not yet an argument for foundationalism as much as\nan argument against what we might call\n\u201cinferentialism\u201d\u2014the view that all justification is\ninferential\u2014for it leaves open the skeptical position that we\nare not, and could not be, justified in believing anything at all,\nwhether by inference or otherwise. This most radical of all\nskepticisms seems absurd (it entails that one couldn\u2019t even be\njustified in believing it). But, strictly speaking, none of this shows\nthat we have non-inferential justification for any of our beliefs, or\neven that non-inferential justification is possible. At best, it shows\nonly that, if justification is possible, or if we\nare or could be justified in believing anything at all, then\nthat justification must take a foundationalist structure. The\nepistemic regress argument for foundationalism thus needs an\nadditional premise, though one that all but the most radical skeptics\nwould accept: that epistemic justification is in principle possible\nfor beings like us.\n\nIf we accept the more controversial second clause of PIJ, the looming\nregresses proliferate. Not only must S above be justified in\nbelieving E1, S must also be justified in believing\nthat E1 makes likely P, a proposition he would have\nto infer (if there are no foundations) from some other proposition\nF1, which he would have to infer from F2, which he\nwould have to infer from F3, and so on ad infinitum.\nBut S would also need to be justified in believing that\nF1 does in fact make likely that E1 makes likely\nP, a proposition he would need to infer from some other\nproposition G1, which he would need to infer from some other\nproposition G2, and so on. And he would need to infer that\nG1 does indeed make likely that F1 makes likely that\nE1 makes likely P, and so on. Without\nnoninferentially justified beliefs, it would seem that we would need\nto complete an infinite number of infinitely long chains of reasoning\nin order to be justified in believing anything!\n\nPIJ is controversial, especially its second clause. It is important to\nnote that either clause of the principle can be used by itself to\ngenerate the allegedly vicious regress for the philosopher who rejects\nfoundations. It is the two clauses combined that are supposed to\npresent the anti-foundationalist with an infinite number of vicious\nregresses. A number of philosophers (among them foundationalists)\nwould argue that the second clause of PIJ confuses levels of epistemic\nquestions. It is far too strong to require someone to have a justified\nbelief in a probabilistic connection between available evidence and\nthe conclusion reached on the basis of that evidence. Such a\nrequirement is at best plausible for having second-level\njustification, justification for the epistemic belief that one has an\ninferentially justified belief. In responding to a challenge presented\nto one\u2019s having an inferentially justified belief in P\non the basis of E, one might find oneself searching for\njustification to support the claim that E makes probable\nP, but that is only because in the context of the challenge\none is trying to support or justify the claim that one has a justified\nbelief. A similar claim might be made with respect to clause (1) of\nthe principle, although it is more difficult to generate the\nsupporting intuition.\n\nIn any event, the careful foundationalist is certainly not\nconfused about level-distinctions. The foundationalist who\nsupports PIJ is claiming that a necessary condition for\nsomeone\u2019s having an inferentially justified belief in P\nbased on E is that the person have both a justified belief in\nE and a justified belief in the proposition that E\nmakes P probable. It is simply not enough that E is\ntrue or that E does in fact make probable P. Our\noriginal examples used to support PIJ would seem to reinforce that\nconclusion. Even if there happened to be some bizarre connection\nbetween palm lines and length of life, for example, the person who has\nno reason to believe that such a connection exists has no\njustification for conclusions reached about length of life based on\nthis anatomical feature of people. Similarly, even though there is in\nfact a connection between ingesting hemlock and dying, a person who\nhad no reason to believe that ingesting hemlock would bring about\ndeath has no justification for believing that someone (who has just\ningested hemlock) is about to die. Some have attempted to defend a\nweaker version of the principle, one that replaces the second clause\nof PIJ with the condition that the subject have some sort of\nnon-doxastic awareness or appreciation of the connection--e.g., that\none be acquainted with the connection or that it appear to one that\nthe connection holds (e.g., Tucker 2012). \n\nThere are responses to the charge of vicious regress facing\nanti-foundationalists. One is to deny the premise that circular\ninferences are vicious or no good: granted, one can\u2019t\neffectively convince someone who is skeptical of the truth of\nP that it is true by relying on an inference that ultimately\ncomes back to P, but perhaps circular inferences can provide\njustification despite being dialectically ineffective (i.e.,\nineffective in persuading others). Still, it seems odd to say that one\ncould justify P by use of an inference from P .\nAfter all, if P is already justified, the subject does not\nneed to use it to justify P; and if it is not justified then,\nin line with the first clause of PIJ, one could not use it to justify\nP. More plausibly, the anti-foundationalist might reject the\npresupposition that all justification is linear or one-directional,\nthat it flows from one belief to another, or is inherited by a belief\nfrom others. According to coherentism about epistemic justification,\nbeliefs are justified \u201cholistically\u201d rather than in a\nlinear, piecemeal way. Each belief is justified by virtue of its\ncoherence with the rest of what one believes\u2014in other words, by\nvirtue of belonging to a coherent set or web of beliefs. The\ncoherentist avoids the appearance of vicious circularity by insisting\nthat one needn\u2019t first have justification for believing\nthe other propositions in one\u2019s belief system. The coherence\ntheorist\u2019s response to the argument for foundationalism is, of\ncourse, only as plausible as the coherence theory of justification\n(see\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification).\n\nSome forms of coherentism might complicate our taxonomy. According to\nsome coherentists, a belief can depend for its justification on how\nwell it \u201ccoheres\u201d with the rest of one\u2019s beliefs,\nand if this coherence is not understood in terms of\nactual or available inference, then they would allow for dependent but\nnon-inferentially justified belief. Some beliefs may count as\nfoundational in the sense of not depending on inference from other\nbeliefs for justification, while still depending on other beliefs.\n\n\nOne other response is to embrace infinitism and hold that an infinite\nregress is not necessarily vicious or problematic. Infinitism has a\nfew defenders (e.g., Peter Klein (1998) and more recently, Fantl\n(2003) and Aikin (2011)). The infinitist accepts the need to be\nable to supply non-circular justification for believing what\nwe do, but argues that given the complexity of the human mind and its\ncapacity to entertain and justifiably believe an infinite number of\npropositions, there is nothing vicious about the relevant regresses we\nface. There is no reason to suppose that we would be unable to justify\nevery proposition we believe by appeal to some other different\nproposition which we justifiably believe. Infinitism is a view that\nshould be seriously considered, particularly once one realizes that\none not only can but arguably does have an infinite number of\njustified beliefs (e.g., that 2 is greater than 1, that 3 is greater\nthat 1, and so on.). For some further discussion of infinitism and\nchallenges to it, see Klein and Turri (2014).\n\nSome don\u2019t find the regress argument to be the best argument for\nthe existence of foundational justification; as with any argument by\nelimination, it depends on whether the alternatives eliminated really\nare untenable. Pryor (2013b), for example, claims that the best\nargument comes from considering examples. I believe that I feel tired,\nthat I have a headache, that I intend to get a glass of water, that\nblack is not white; and in each case, it doesn\u2019t seem that my\njustification is mediated by any other proposition. This supports the\nclaim that there are foundational beliefs, though it does not speak\ndirectly to the thesis that all other beliefs must depend, ultimately,\non foundational beliefs for their justification. \n2. The Classical Analysis of Foundational Justification\n\nFoundationalists are united in their conviction that there must be a\nkind of justification that does not depend on the having of\njustification for other beliefs. They nevertheless disagree radically\namong themselves as to how to understand foundational justification.\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, the rise of\nexternalist epistemologies has generated even more fundamentally\ndifferent versions of foundationalism. It will not be possible to\nsurvey all of the strikingly different analyses or theories that have\nbeen offered of foundational justification. In what follows we will\nexamine a few of the more prominent versions of classical and\ncontemporary internalist and externalist foundationalism.\n2.1 Foundational Justification as Infallible Belief\n\nDescartes is often taken to be the paradigm of a classical\nfoundationalist. Determined to build knowledge on appropriate and\nsecure foundations, he seemed to want to identify foundational\nknowledge with infallible belief (though there is another\ninterpretation that we\u2019ll turn to in the next section, one that\nidentifies foundational knowledge with infallible\njustification). Implicitly or explicitly, others seemed to\nfollow his lead by restricting foundationally justified beliefs to\nbeliefs that cannot be mistaken. Following Lehrer (1974: 81) we might\nformulate the following definition of infallible belief:\nS\u2019s belief that P at t is infallible\nif S\u2019s believing P at t\n entails[4]\n that P is true.\n\nAs Lehrer and others have pointed out, it is far from clear that this\nconcept of infallible belief has much relevance to an attempt to\nunderstand the epistemic concept of foundational justification. The\nfirst and most striking problem involves necessary truths. Every\nnecessary truth is entailed by every proposition, and thus if I happen\nto believe a necessary truth, P, that I believe P\nwill entail that P is true. Thus, by the above definition my\nbelief that P will be infallible--and so, on the present\naccount, foundationally justified--whenever P is a necessary\ntruth even if P is something exceedingly complicated that I\ncan barely even comprehend.\n\nFurthermore, a foundation of knowledge and justified belief restricted\nto infallible beliefs (as defined above) would arguably be far too\nthin to support any sort of substantial epistemic edifice. There are a\nfew contingent propositions that are entailed by the fact that they\nare believed. My belief that I exist entails that I exist, that I have\nat least one belief, that someone has beliefs, etc. But once we get\npast these sorts of \u201cself-referential\u201d propositions,\npropositions whose very subject matter is encompassed by the fact that\nthey are believed, it is hard to come up with uncontroversial examples\nof contingent infallible beliefs. Ayer (1956: 19) argues that as long\nas the belief that P is one state of affairs and\nP\u2019s being the case is an entirely different state of\naffairs (not including as a constituent the former) there can be no\nlogical absurdity in the supposition that the former could occur\nwithout the latter (see BonJour 1985: 27, for a similar argument).\n2.2 Foundational Justification as Infallible Justification\n\nIt may be that classical foundationalists start off on the wrong foot\nif they seek foundations in logical relations between the mere fact\nthat someone believes some proposition and the proposition\u2019s\nbeing true. Foundational justification is, after all, a kind of\njustification, and if the impossibility of error is essential to\nfoundational justification, it may be more plausible to locate the\nsource of infallibility in a special kind of justification available\nin support of a belief. Let us say that S\u2019s belief is\ninfallibly justified at t when S\u2019s ground or\njustification for believing P at t entails the truth\nof P\u2014in other words, when S cannot have that\nground or justification for believing that P while P\nis false. The suggestion, then, is that a belief is foundationally\njustified only if it is infallibly justified in this sense.\n\nWe still need to qualify the entailment in some way to circumvent the\nproblem discussed earlier. Whenever I have any justification at all\nfor believing a proposition that turns out to be necessarily true,\nthat justification will entail the necessary truth. But we do not want\njust any sort of justification to yield infallibly justified belief,\neven if the object of that belief is a necessary truth. This problem\nis notoriously difficult to solve (see the entry on\n Certainty\n for more), but intuitively the solution should have something to do\nwith the relation between the fact that would make true the\nproposition entailed and the fact that would make true the proposition\nthat entails it. More specifically, we could say that P\nentails* Q only if the fact that would make P true\nis at least a constituent of the fact that would make Q true.\nThis suggestion can be considered at best only preliminary since we\nwill obviously need a more detailed account of facts and their\nconstituents. That I have grey hair entails that someone has grey\nhair, but is my having grey hair a constituent of the fact that is\nsomeone\u2019s having grey hair? There is certainly a sense in which\nit is something one can point to in answer to the question \u201cWhat\nmakes it true that someone has grey hair?\u201d One cannot\nappropriately point to my having grey hair as something that makes it\ntrue that two plus two equals four. With some such relation in place,\nperhaps we can appropriately restrict the class of necessary truths we\ncan be infallibly justified in believing, and still allow contingent\ntruths to be infallibly justified: there is a sense in which one can\n\u201cpoint\u201d to one\u2019s own experience when asked,\n\u201cWhat makes it true that you are in pain?\u201d\n\nConsider again my belief that I\u2019m in pain (when I am). If such a\nbelief is foundationally justified, in what does the justification for\nthat belief consist? What is it that distinguishes this belief from my\nbelief about, say, whether it will rain next week? Some\nfoundationalists want to locate the foundational justification in the\ntruth-maker for the proposition believed. What justifies me in\nbelieving that I\u2019m in pain when I am is the mere fact that\nI\u2019m in pain. But again, what is it about my being in pain as\nopposed to its raining next week which makes it appropriate to claim\nthat my being in pain justifies me in believing that I\u2019m in pain\nwhile its raining next week doesn\u2019t justify me in believing that\nit will rain next week?\n\nIt is tempting to think that the foundationalist is better off\nappealing to some special relation that I have to my pain\nwhich makes it unnecessary to look to other beliefs in order to\njustify my belief that I\u2019m in pain. It is the fact that I have a\nkind of access to my pain that no one else has that makes my\nbelief foundationally justified while others must rely on inference in\norder to discover that I am in this state. This takes us to another\nclassical version of foundationalism, the acquaintance theory. Perhaps\nthe best known proponent of an acquaintance theory is Bertrand Russell\n(1910\u201311, 1913; for more on the acquaintance theory, see entry\non\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description).\n But it takes little imagination to read the view into most of the\nBritish empiricists. Roughly the view is that what justifies\nS in believing that he is in pain is the fact that S\nis acquainted with his pain in a way in which he is not acquainted\nwith any contingent facts about other people, the physical world, the\nfuture, and so on. Russell (1910\u201311) characterizes acquaintance\nas a relation of direct or immediate awareness, a relation in\nwhich, as he and some others have put it, something is\n\u201cpresented\u201d or simply \u201cgiven\u201d to the subject\n(Lewis 1929 and 1946; Moser 1989: 80ff.; Fales 1996).\n\nSome doubt that acquaintance with some fact is sufficient, on its own,\nto justify belief in a corresponding proposition. To help see the\nmotivation for this, consider inferential beliefs again. A justified\nbelief that P cannot provide justification for believing\nevery other proposition it entails, for it might be that the\nentailment relation is beyond one\u2019s cognitive grasp, or the\ninference is not something one has made or is even able to make. (As\nalready discussed in\n section 1,\n reflection on such cases might lead us to accept the second clause of\nPIJ.) Similarly, some acquaintance theorists argue that acquaintance\nwith some fact cannot provide justification for a belief in the\nabsence of an awareness of (or at least an ability to become aware of)\nthe relevance of the fact to the truth of the proposition believed.\nFor example, I may be acquainted with a very specific color or shape\nin my visual field, and also believe (correctly) that I am\nexperiencing such-and-such a color or shape, but I might actually be\nreally bad at identifying such specific features and my belief might\nbe little more than a lucky guess. Suppose these theorists also accept\na correspondence conception of truth according to which, roughly, a\nproposition is true just in case it corresponds to the facts or to the\nway the world is; they might add that to be fully justified in\nbelieving a proposition to be true one must be acquainted not only\nwith the fact that makes the proposition true but also with the\nrelation of correspondence that holds between the proposition and the\nfact. For example, in order to be justified in believing that I am\nexperiencing fuchsia, I must be acquainted with (or at least be able\nto become acquainted with) the \u201cmatch\u201d, \u201cfit\u201d,\nor correspondence between my thought or belief that I am experiencing\nfuchsia and the fact that I am experiencing\n fuchsia.[5]\n\nWhen acquaintance with the fact that P is part of what\nconstitutes my foundational justification for believing P,\nthere is a trivial sense in which my foundational justification is\ninfallible. I can\u2019t be directly acquainted with the fact that\nP while I believe P falsely. However, most\ncontemporary foundationalists are fallibilists about foundational\njustification: they hold that one could be foundationally justified in\nbelieving propositions that are false. It seems plausible that I could\nbe justified in believing, for example, that I am experiencing a mild\npain when in fact I am experiencing an itch, or that I could be\njustified in believing I am experiencing a specific shade of color\nwhen I am in fact experiencing a slightly different shade. Even some\nacquaintance theorists want to allow for some fallible foundations.\nFor example, Fumerton (1995) holds that one can be noninferentially\njustified in believing P by virtue of being directly\nacquainted with a fact very similar to, but ultimately different from,\nthe fact that P (the fact that makes P true). Such\nan acquaintance theory could allow for the possibility of a\nfoundationally justified but false belief that P. Huemer\n(2007), Poston (2010), and Tucker (2016) argue, however, that\nclassical foundationalists have difficulty accommodating fallible\nfoundational beliefs. For some replies, see Fumerton (2010 and 2016),\nand Hasan (2013).\n\nNot all classical foundationalists require acquaintance with the\ncorrespondence (or some other similar relation) between some thought\nor proposition and a distinct fact for one to have knowledge by\nacquaintance. For example, according to McGrew (1995, 1998), for any\nobject of acquaintance or direct awareness it is possible to form a\nbelief in which a demonstrative concept refers directly to it. By\nvirtue of my acquaintance with a painful experience, I can believe\ndirectly of it that it exists, or that the property demonstrated,\npainfulness, is instantiated. We could express the belief roughly by\nsaying \u201cI am experiencing this.\u201d For this kind of\nbelief (unlike most other beliefs regarding contingent facts), to\ngenuinely understand or grasp the content of the belief is to\ngrasp its truth. Such demonstratively formed beliefs are guaranteed to\nbe true:\n\n\nFor what this belief amounts to is that one has a certain experience;\nand a necessary condition for the formation of the belief itself is\nthat one be having just that experience. (McGrew 1995: 90)\n\n\nRather than attempt to accommodate fallible foundations, McGrew\nfollows early classical foundationalists in arguing that infallibility\nor infallible justification (what he calls\n\u201cincorrigibility\u201d) is in fact required for foundational\njustification. Some worry, however, that such foundations, even if\nthey are generally available, are too \u201cthin\u201d: that I am\n\u201cexperiencing this\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to convey\nanything about what sort of experience I am having, and it is\ndifficult to see how we could get from here to justified beliefs that\ninvolve categorizing or conceptualizing our experiences in more\ninformative ways (see, e.g., Sosa 2003).\n3. Objections to Classical Foundationalism\n\nOnce the received view, classical foundationalism has come under\nconsiderable attack in the last few decades. Here we will consider the\nmost prominent objections that target the classical view of\nfoundational beliefs. (For some more objections and discussion, see\nentry on\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description.)\n3.1 Regress Problems for Access Internalism\n\nLaurence BonJour (1985: ch. 4) raised a highly influential objection\nto foundationalism (an objection raised before he joined the ranks of\nfoundationalists). The objection presupposed a strong form of what we\nmight call access internalism. (We discuss the internalist/externalist\ncontroversy in more detail in\n section 6\n below.) The access internalist argues, roughly, that a feature of a\nbelief or epistemic situation that makes a belief foundationally\njustified for us must be a feature to which we have actual or\npotential access. Moreover, we must have access to the fact that the\nfeature in question is relevant to the truth or probability of what we\nbelieve. Suppose some foundationalist offers an account according to\nwhich a belief B is foundationally justified only if it has\nsome characteristic X. BonJour argues that the mere fact that\nthe belief has X could not justify the believer in holding\nB. The believer would also need access to the fact that\nB has X and that beliefs of this sort are likely to\nbe true. But according to the strong access requirement BonJour\naccepts, this requires actual or potential knowledge or justified\nbelief that B has X and that beliefs of this\nsort are likely to be true. So B would need other justified\nbeliefs for its justification. B\u2019s status as a\nfoundationally justified belief is destroyed.\n\nBonJour presented the objection on the way to developing a coherence\ntheory of empirical justification. But it ultimately became obvious\nthat the objection to foundationalism was too strong. Given the\nstructure of the argument it should become evident that the coherence\ntheory (and any other theory) would be equally vulnerable to the\nargument. Just replace \u201cX\u201d with some complicated\ndescription of beliefs cohering with each other. Coherence of\none\u2019s beliefs would never be sufficient for justification, for\none would have to already be justified in believing that one\u2019s\nbeliefs were coherent and that such coherence makes one\u2019s\nbeliefs likely to be true. That might suggest to the classical\nfoundationalist that strong access internalism is a view to be\navoided.\n\nMichael Bergmann (2006: chs. 1 and 2) argues, however, that if to\navoid regress we drop the strong access requirements that are so dear\nto some internalists, we also lose the motivation for the view. As\nBergmann sees it, the attraction of internalism is its claim to be\nable to construe justification in such a way that it gives a subject\nwith a justified belief a certain assurance from the subjective\nperspective, an assurance that externalist views (discussed below)\ndon\u2019t offer. According to Bergmann, even acquaintance with truth\nbearers, truth makers and a correspondence holding between them\ndoesn\u2019t carry with it assurance unless it is accompanied by a\njustified belief that all these relations obtain. And this will take\nus again on the road to regress. Bergmann\u2019s challenge is serious\nand the traditional acquaintance theorist who rejects the strong\naccess requirement will need to convince you that acquaintance with\nthe correspondence between a fact and a thought that P can make a\ndifference to the subject\u2019s perspective on the truth of P\nwithout needing justification for thinking that the fact corresponds to\nP (see Hasan 2011 for a reply along these lines). Alternatively, the\ninternalist might attempt to convince you that the regress that comes\nwith accepting the strong access requirement is not vicious after all\n(see Fales 2014).\n3.2 The Sellarsian Dilemma\n\nBonJour was quite aware that some classical foundationalists would\nattempt to avoid the regress problem raised in the previous section by\nappeal to the idea that some things are simply \u201cgiven\u201d to\nus, or that we directly \u201capprehend\u201d or are\n\u201cacquainted with\u201d them. Inspired by Sellars (1963),\nBonJour (1978, 1985: ch. 4) presented the following objection to\nclassical foundationalism, often referred to as the \u201cSellarsian\nDilemma\u201d. Does the awareness or acquaintance that is the alleged\nsource of noninferential justification involve the acceptance of a\nproposition or thought, or at least the categorization of some sensory\nitem or the application of some concept to experience? If, on the one\nhand, the acquaintance or awareness is propositional or conceptual in\nthis way, then while such acts or episodes of awareness seem capable,\nin principle, of justifying other beliefs, they would surely need to\nbe justified themselves. The episode of awareness would involve\nsomething like the acceptance of a proposition, or the categorization\nof experience, and such an attitude or act clearly needs justification\nif it is to justify anything else. But then, the allegedly\nfoundational belief is not foundational after all. If, on the other\nhand, we can regard direct awareness as nonpropositional and\nnonconceptual, then while these acts or states of awareness do not\nrequire or even admit of justification they also don\u2019t seem\ncapable on their own of providing a reason or justification for\npropositional items like beliefs. Therefore, the classical\nfoundationalist\u2019s acquaintance or direct awareness cannot serve\nas a foundational source of knowledge or justified belief.\n\nOne proposed solution to the dilemma begins by emphasizing that\nacquaintance with a fact is not by itself an epistemic relation. The\nacquaintance theorist can argue that one has a noninferentially\njustified belief that P only when one has the thought that\nP and one is acquainted with the fact that P, the\nthought that P, and the relation of correspondence holding\nbetween the thought that P and the fact that P. On\nsuch a view no single act of acquaintance yields knowledge or\njustified belief, but when everything that is constitutive of a\nthought or a proposition\u2019s being true is immediately before\nconsciousness, there is nothing more that one could want or need to\njustify a belief. Acts of acquaintance, including acquaintance with\npropositions, do not involve belief, judgment, or concept application,\nand so do not need justification. However, if the objects of\nacquaintance, that with which we are acquainted, can be propositional,\nthen perhaps acquaintance with the rights sorts of items (including\npropositional ones) can make a difference to justification. This view\nthus grants that a single act of acquaintance with a fact does not\nprovide justification, but rejects the dilemma\u2019s assumption that\nthere are no acts of acquaintance that can, singly or in any\ncombination, make a difference to justification. (See Fumerton 1995\nfor a reply of this sort. For a reply that is similar in many\nrespects, see BonJour 2000 and 2003.)\n\nA classical foundationalist who prefers McGrew\u2019s (1995, 1998)\nview, according to which noninferentially justified beliefs are formed\nby demonstrative reference, would give a somewhat different response.\nAn act of acquaintance alone is not sufficient for justification; one\nmust also form a belief in such a way that the direct object of\nacquaintance becomes a constituent of the belief itself, or part of\nthe belief\u2019s very content. The relevance of the truth-maker to\nthe proposition believed is transparent and guaranteed by the manner\nin which the belief is formed: acquaintance simply picks out some\nfeature of experience and takes it up into the content of a belief or\njudgment that asserts that the feature exists or is instantiated. This\nview thus grants that an act of acquaintance does not automatically\nprovide justification for a corresponding belief, but rejects the\ndilemma\u2019s assumption that there is no way to use the act of\nacquaintance in forming one\u2019s belief in a way that does make a\ndifference to justification.\n3.3 Doubts about Correspondence and Acquaintance\n\nThe direct acquaintance theorist does presuppose the intelligibility\nof a world that has \u201cstructure\u201d independent of any\nstructure imposed by the mind. Without facts that are independent of\nthe thoughts and judgments that represent them, one could not make\nsense of a relation of acquaintance between a person and a fact, a\nrelation that grounds foundational justification. More radical\ncontemporary rejections of foundationalism may well involve\ndissatisfaction with the foundationalist\u2019s implicit commitment\nto a strong realistic correspondence conception of truth as involving\nsome relation to mind-independent facts. A discussion of problems with\nthe correspondence conception and alternatives would take us far\nafield, however. (For more, see the entry on the\n correspondence theory of truth.)\n\nJust as some reject the conception of truth underlying classical\nfoundationalist accounts of foundational justification, so others\nprofess to be bewildered by some of the fundamental concepts employed\nin defining foundational justification. The acquaintance theorist\ntends to have relatively little to say by way of analyzing what direct\nacquaintance is. To be sure, one can try to give someone a feel for\nwhat one is talking about by a method of contrast--e.g., by\ncontrasting one\u2019s awareness of pain with the temporary\ndistraction caused by an engrossing conversation. It is tempting to\nsuppose that for a short time the pain was still present but the\nperson with the pain was no longer aware of the fact that the pain\nexists. This awareness, the acquaintance theorist will argue, is\nobviously something over and above mere belief in the existence of the\npain, as one can believe that one is in a mental state (say a\nsubconscious mental state) without being aware of that state. (Some\nmay find it odd to speak of having a pain without being aware of it;\nin that case, it may help to consider similar cases involving desire,\nhope, fear, or belief.) Like most theories foundationalism will,\nhowever, ultimately rest its intelligibility on an appeal to a basic\nor primitive concept, one that defies further analysis. Just as one\nneeds to end epistemic regresses with foundational justification, the\nfoundationalist will argue, so one needs to end conceptual regresses\nwith concepts one grasps without further definition.\n3.4 The Threat of Skepticism\n\nAlthough opponents of classical foundationalism are not always eager\nto admit it, we suspect that the primary dissatisfaction with\nclassical foundationalism lies with the difficulty the view has\navoiding radical skepticism. On infallible belief, infallible\njustification, or direct acquaintance theories of foundational\njustification, there is precious little included in the foundations of\nknowledge. Most classical foundationalists reject the idea that one\ncan have noninferentially justified beliefs about the past, but the\npresent disappears into the past in the blink of an eye. How can one\neven hope to get back the vast body of knowledge one\npre-philosophically supposes one has, if one\u2019s epistemic base is\nso impoverished? If the second clause of the Principle of Inferential\nJustification were accepted, the problem is even more serious. One\nmight be able to convince oneself that one can know noninferentially\nthe principles of deductive reasoning, but deduction will not take one\nusefully beyond the foundations of knowledge and justified belief. As\nMill (1906: 126) argued, there is a very real sense in which one\ndoesn\u2019t advance one\u2019s knowledge significantly employing a\nform of reasoning that takes one only to conclusions that were\nimplicitly contained in the conjunction of one\u2019s premises. To\nadvance beyond foundations we will inevitably need to employ\nnon-deductive reasoning and according to PIJ that will ultimately\nrequire us to have noninferential knowledge of propositions describing\nprobability connections between evidence and conclusions that are not\nlogically implied by the evidence. It is not absurd on the face of it\nto suppose that one can have noninferential a priori\nknowledge of probabilistic connections, but it is perhaps an\nunderstatement to say that the view is not popular (see Russell 1948\nfor an excellent discussion of this issue).\n4. Internalist Alternatives to Classical Foundationalism\n\nWe noted above that at least many philosophers are convinced that\nacceptance of classical foundationalism leads inevitably to an\nunacceptably radical skepticism. Some contemporary epistemologists\nseek a more modest foundationalism that will make it much easier to\nrespond to the skeptic\u2019s arguments. Michael Huemer\u2019s\n(2001) phenomenal conservatism and Jim Pryor\u2019s (2000) dogmatism\nare both views that are far more \u201cpermissive\u201d in allowing\nan extensive range of beliefs to have foundational justification. And\ntheir views are not unrelated to Chisholm\u2019s longstanding efforts\n(e.g., 1989) to locate foundational justification for believing\nvarious propositions about one\u2019s past and about one\u2019s\nphysical environment in the character of one\u2019s experiential\nstates.\n\nHuemer offers his view as an improvement on a cruder view once\ndefended by Chisholm (1980) that is often called \u201cepistemic\nconservatism\u201d and sometimes, more aptly, \u201cdoxastic\nconservatism.\u201d The doxastic conservative takes the mere fact\nthat you believe some proposition P to provide prima\nfacie justification for believing P. This view does not\nimply that the mere fact that you believe something renders the belief\njustified, for it may be that your belief is prima facie\njustified but not ultima facie justified: if you have\ngood reasons to disbelieve P, or good reasons to think that\nyour belief that P is unreliable or untrustworthy, then your\nbelief is \u201cdefeated\u201d and not justified. In other words,\naccording to doxastic conservatism, if S believes that P\nthen, in the absence of defeaters, S has justification for\nbelieving that P. \n\nMany worry that the view is vulnerable to counterexamples, for it\nseems committed to regarding beliefs that clearly have nothing going\nfor them as justified. One of the better counterexamples involves\ncases in which one forms a belief in a proposition one has no evidence\nfor or against. Suppose that despite lacking any evidence for or\nagainst the belief, S somehow comes to believe that there is\nan even number of grains of sand on a particular beach (Foley 1983:\n174\u20135), or that a particular coin that is tossed and lands out\nof sight has landed \u201ctails\u201d up (Christensen 1994: 74).\nSuppose also that S lacks any defeaters for the belief:\nS has no evidence against the proposition, and is not aware\nof having formed the belief without evidence or in an unreliable way.\nDoxastic conservatism yields the counterintuitive result that this\nbelief is rational or justified. (For an attempt to respond to this\nand related objections on behalf of doxastic conservatism, see McCain\n2008.)\n\nIn any event, most foundationalists sympathetic to internalism prefer\na view according to which a non-belief state provides justification\nfor foundational belief. According to phenomenal\nconservatism, the justifying state is a \u201cseeming\u201d or\n\u201cappearance\u201d: if it seems to S that\nP, then, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby has\nsome degree of justification for believing that P (Huemer\n2001, 2007, 2013; Cullison 2010; Tucker 2010; Skene 2013). These\nappearances come in various sorts: sensory or perceptual, intellectual\nor intuitive, mnemonic, and introspective. Many use the term\n\u201cdogmatism\u201d to refer to the same view, or to the view\nrestricted to some domain, typically to perception: if it\nperceptually seems to S that P,\nthen, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby has some\njustification for believing that P.\n\nIt is worth noting that Pryor himself uses the term\n\u201cdogmatism\u201d to refer to the view that \u201cjustification\nis sometimes both immediate and underminable\u201d (2013a: 96), and\nso uses the term in a way that is compatible with the rejection of\nphenomenal conservatism and dogmatism as these terms are generally\nunderstood. While those who accept the principle (whether in its\ngeneral form or as restricted to perceptual seemings) do thereby hold\nthat some states provide immediate but underminable or defeasible\njustification, it is possible to accept that some other states provide\nimmediate but underminable justification and deny that perceptual\nseemings do. However, for simplicity and to follow the more common\nusage, we use the two labels \u201cphenomenal conservatism\u201d and\n\u201cdogmatism\u201d more or less interchangeably in what\nfollows.\n\nThe main motivation for phenomenal conservatism is straightforward. As\nalready noted, the view is far more \u201cpermissive\u201d than\nclassical foundationalism in allowing for more extensive foundational\njustification. For example, I believe that there is a cat on my lap,\nthat I had fish for dinner last night, that I feel thirsty, that I am\nthinking about getting a glass of water, that pleasure is good, and\nthat 2 + 3 = 5. Prima facie, it is plausible to say that I\nbelieve these propositions because they seem or appear to be\ntrue\u2014because it seems to me that there is a cat on my lap, that\nI had fish last night, and so on. If I do indeed believe these things\non the basis of these seemings or appearances, and they constitute an\nadequate source of justification, then, in the absence of defeaters, I\nhave justification for these beliefs. And if we deny that they are\ngood sources of justification, then how do we avoid skepticism? As\nHuemer puts it, \u201cif undefeated appearances are not a source of\njustified belief, then how is one to avoid skepticism about the\nexternal world, the past, values, abstract objects, and so on? Unless\nthis challenge can be met, we would be wise to place our trust in the\nappearances\u2026.\u201d (2013, p. 349). \n\nWhat exactly are these \u201cseemings\u201d or\n\u201cappearances\u201d? The distinction between seemings and\nbeliefs is typically introduced with examples. Once we are familiar\nwith the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, we no longer believe that the\nlines are of unequal length even though, in some sense, they still\nappear to be unequal. The same holds for various apparent intuitions\nand apparent memories that we become convinced are false. Moreover,\nbeliefs are subject to epistemic norms and can be supported by\nepistemic reasons, while it doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to say\nthe same of appearances (McCain and Moretti 2021, p. 56\u20137).\nHuemer and others will claim that seemings cannot be identified with\ndispositions to believe, inclinations to believe, or impulses to\nbelieve, though not everyone will agree about this. Huemer argues for\nthis on three main grounds (2007: 30\u20131). First, it is possible\nto have a persisting seeming or appearance (e.g., that one line is\nlonger than another, or that a stick submerged in water is bent) but\nbe so convinced that it is a mere illusion that you have no\ndisposition or inclination to believe it. Second, it is possible to be\ninclined to believe that P (because, e.g., you really want it\nto be true) in the absence of a corresponding seeming that P.\nThird, appearances can provide non-trivial explanations for what we\nbelieve or what we are disposed to believe: I am inclined to believe\nthat there is a bus approaching because it perceptually seems that\nthere is; understanding the latter seeming as an inclination to\nbelieve trivializes the explanation. Some have pointed out, however,\nthat many problems raised with doxastic accounts of appearances can be\navoided by understanding appearances as beliefs or inclinations to\nbelieve with different contents. According to Gl\u00fcer (2018)\nperceptual appearances might be understood as beliefs to the effect\nthat something looks some way. And according to Conee (2013)\nand Tooley (2013), seemings can be understood as felt inclinations to\nbelieve that some state is evidence for P.\n\nProponents of phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism generally hold\nthat seemings are a kind of experience distinct from beliefs and\ninclinations to believe. But they also hold that seemings are\nnevertheless belief-like in that they are propositional attitudes or\nat least have propositional or representational contents. And they\nhold that seemings have a distinctive phenomenal character: seemings\nare \u201cassertive\u201d (Huemer 2013); they have a\n\u201cphenomenal force\u201d to them such that \u201cit\n\u2018feels as if\u2019 we can just tell that those propositions are\ntrue\u2026just by virtue of having them so represented\u201d (Pryor\n2000, p. 547, n. 23); \u201ca seeming that P\n\u2018recommends\u2019 P as true or \u2018assures\u2019\nthe subject of P\u2019s truth\u201d (Tucker 2013). There is an\ninteresting disagreement among those who are take seemings to be a\nkind of experience, a disagreement that exists even among those who\nare sympathetic to phenomenal conservatism or dogmatism in some form.\nThe disagreement concerns the relationship between seemings and\nsensations or sensory experiences. According to some (e.g., Huemer\n2001, Ch. 4 and Tolhurst 1998) sensations are themselves a kind or\nspecies of seeming\u2014perceptual seemings\u2014while others (e.g.,\nTucker 2010, Brogaard 2013) take sensations to be distinct from\nperceptual seemings, though often accompanied by them. (For more on\nthe relationship between sensations and seemings, see Tucker 2013, pp.\n7\u20138.) Some have argued that any appearance-based theory of\njustification should accept that other features accompanying\nappearances can affect whether and how strongly they might justify\nbeliefs (Reiland 2015, Brogaard and Gatzia 2018, McCain and Moretti\n2021).\n\nSome have pointed out that attempting to capture the phenomenal\ncharacter of seemings by saying they are \u201cassertive\u201d is\npotentially misleading given that judgments and beliefs are assertive\nand seemings are supposed to be non-doxastic experiential states\n(Smithies 2019, p. 93, McAllister 2018, p. 3082), and something\nsimilar might be said of the claim that seemings\n\u201crecommend\u201d or \u201cassure\u201d us of their truth.\nSome find the appeal to phenomenal force obscure (Conee 2013 and\nTooley 2013), while many others take something like phenomenal force\nto be an important and familiar, if difficult to describe, feature of\nmental states (e.g., Pryor 2000, Makie 2013, McGrath 2013, Skene 2013,\nMcAllister 2018, Moretti and McCain 2021). \n\nBoth Huemer and Pryor make clear that the intentional states that\nprovide justification do so without one\u2019s having to be aware of\nthe fact that one is in such states. They might both allow, however,\nthat one can turn one\u2019s attention inward to discover the fact\nthat one is in such states, and that one can, in principle, discover\n(perhaps a priori) that the states in question do give one\nthe relevant epistemic justification.\n5. Objections to Internalist Alternatives to Classical Foundationalism\n\nIn this section, we focus on objections commonly raised against\nphenomenal conservatism and dogmatism, though they arguably apply to\nother internalist foundationalist views as well.\n\nAs one might expect, the main worry with both Huemer\u2019s\nphenomenal conservatism and Pryor\u2019s dogmatism is the very air of\ndogmatism that Pryor embraces in his label for the view. It strikes\nmany epistemologists that these views make getting justification for\none\u2019s beliefs too easy. Perhaps sensations are representational\nstates, and perhaps there is the kind of representational state that\nHuemer and other phenomenal conservatives call an appearance or a\nseeming, but as why should we assume that they accurately represent\nthe world around us? Fear is a representational or propositional\nstate, but from the fact that I fear that there are ghosts, it hardly\nseems to follow that I have a prima facie justification for\nbelieving that there are ghosts. For that matter, belief is a\nrepresentational state and if we doubt that mere belief can provide\njustification, why should we think another representational state,\nlike a seeming, provides justification? Huemer and Pryor will answer\nthat the representational states they offer as justifiers, perhaps\nbecause of their peculiar \u201cphenomenal force\u201d or\n\u201cassertiveness\u201d, are simply different in this respect.\nWhile providing no guarantee that the world is as represented, they\nsimply carry with them justification that other representational\nstates are incapable of providing.\n\nThe claim that phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism make getting\njustification too easy can be motivated by the \u201cproblem of easy\nknowledge\u201d. Since this problem has been raised against both\ninternalist and externalist alternatives to classical foundationalism,\nwe present this problem in\n section 8,\n after discussing externalism.\n5.1 The Cognitive Penetration Objection\n\nA recent objection to phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism involves\nappeal to cases of \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d, cases in which\npropositional attitudes (beliefs, fears, desires, etc.) that the\nsubject already has give rise to a related seeming. The objection\ncomes in two forms. The first is the \u201cillegitimate boost\u201d\nobjection. If I have prior justification to believe that P\n(e.g., that my car is in my garage), and that belief causes me to have\na seeming that P (e.g., the belief and expectation make it\nvisually seem to me that my car is in my garage when I glance quickly\nin the direction of my garage), dogmatism entails that the\nbelief\u2019s justification goes up. The usual reply here is that the\nrelevant claim is not counterintuitive. I gain no additional\njustification via the seeming if I have a good reason to suspect that\nmy having the seeming depends on my having the belief; but in the case\nwhere I have no such reason, it is not clearly counterintuitive to say\nthat I am justified. Tucker (2013: 14) gives a useful analogy to\ntestimony: if Bill and Jill both testify to me, at different times,\nthat there is free pizza on the quad, then both testimonies give me\nmore reason to believe than either of them separately, and this still\nholds if unbeknownst to me Jill tells me only because she\nheard it from Bill.\n\nThe second form of the \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d objection\nis sometimes called the \u201ctainted source\u201d objection (Huemer\n2013), and it arises from the fact that propositional attitudes other\nthan justified belief\u2014fears and desires, unjustified beliefs,\netc.\u2014can influence how things seem to us. Suppose, for example,\nthat Jill fears that Jack is angry with her, and that upon seeing Jack\nthat fear partly causes it to seem to her that Jack is angry with her\n(Siegel 2013). Many find it counterintuitive that Jill could acquire\njustification for her belief in this way. The natural suggestion is\nthat the etiology of the belief matters to its epistemic justification\n(see, e.g., Markie 2005, 2013; Goldman 2009; Lyons 2011; Siegel 2013).\nOnce again, there are some who do not share the intuition that the\nsubject\u2019s justification is affected by the belief\u2019s causal\nhistory when that causal history is not accessible to the subject\n(e.g., Huemer 2013). But at least some phenomenal conservatives admit\nto feeling the pull of the intuition in response to some of the cases,\nand attempt to account for it by saying that there is something else\nthat is epistemically bad in the situation\u2014e.g., while the\nbelief is epistemically justified, the agent is epistemically\nirresponsible, criticizable, or cognitively defective in some way\n(e.g., Skene 2013), or lacks the sort of justification that can turn\ntrue belief into knowledge (e.g., Tucker 2010). Some worry, however,\nthat not all the problematic \u201ctainted source\u201d cases can be\nhandled in these ways (see Markie 2013 and McGrath 2013.)\n6. Externalist Versions of Foundationalism\n\nThe epistemic landscape has changed dramatically in the last forty or\nfifty years with the rise of externalist epistemologies. It is\nnotoriously difficult to define clearly the controversy between\ninternalists and externalists in epistemology. (For a detailed\ndiscussion of alternative ways of defining the controversy, see\nFumerton 1995: chs. 3 and 4. See also the entry on\n internalist and externalist conceptions of epistemic justification.)\n\nThere are at least two common ways of understanding the controversy.\nIt is sometimes taken to be a controversy over whether or not one can\nidentify epistemic properties with \u201cinternal\u201d states of\nbelievers. According to the view we might call \u201cinternal state\ninternalism\u201d (sometimes called \u201cmentalism\u201d),\njustification is analyzed in terms of or depends essentially and only\non what is inside the mind. It follows on this view that no two\nindividuals can be internally or mentally alike in all respects and\nyet differ in the justification they have for the same beliefs. In one\nsense, then, to be an externalist (a non-mentalist) is to claim that\none\u2019s justification involves or depends essentially on some\nfacts or states of affairs outside the mind. Others take the\ncontroversy to center over the question of whether one requires\ncertain sorts of access for justification. The \u201caccess\ninternalist\u201d holds (roughly) that being justified in believing\nthat P requires that there be something within or at least\navailable to one\u2019s perspective or awareness which is relevant to\nthe truth or justification of P. (While some access\ninternalists seem to have held that everything that determines\njustification must be accessible, as we are about to see, hardly any\ninternalists hold such a strong position.) The \u201caccess\nexternalist\u201d denies that justification requires any such access.\nThe access externalist need not deny that something relevant to the\ntruth of P is, at least sometimes, accessible to the subject\nwho has justification for P; but paradigm externalists deny\nthat access is always required for justification.\n\nSome accept both forms of \u201cinternalism\u201d, though perhaps\ntake one sense to be more fundamental than the other. For example, one\nmight take access internalism to be more fundamental, and hold that\none can have access only to mental states and internal facts about\nthem, and so accept mentalism as a consequence. Or one might take the\nmentalist thesis to be more fundamental, and argue that one has some\nminimal access to the relevant mental facts, and so accept some form\nof access internalism as well. But it is possible to accept one form\nof internalism and reject the other. Some mentalists might deny that\nwe have access to all the mental states or features that make a\ndifference to justification. And some access internalists might hold\nthat we can be directly aware of external objects, external states of\naffairs, or external abstract entities or relations, and take this\ndirect awareness to make a difference to one\u2019s justification;\nthey would deny that one\u2019s justifiers must always be mental,\nthough they might accept the thesis that there can be no difference in\njustification without a mental difference, assuming that\naccess even to a non-mental entity counts as a mental\nrelation or mental state.\n\nAccess internalisms vary depending on what sort of\n\u201caccess\u201d is required (true belief, justified belief,\nacquaintance, etc.), and on what it is that must be accessed for\njustification. There are thus stronger and weaker forms of access\ninternalism, and as a result the epistemic landscape is quite complex.\nCertainly, paradigm externalists would reject the second clause of the\nPIJ. According to virtually all externalists, one can arrive at a\njustified belief in P by inferring it from E without\nbeing aware of any sort of evidential connection between E\nand P; the fact that there is a good evidential connection\nbetween E and P can be external to the\nsubject\u2019s mind and inaccessible to the subject. They would also\nreject a parallel principle for noninferential justification:\none can arrive at a justified belief on the basis of some sensory or\nother belief-independent input without being aware of any sort of\nevidential connection between the input and the belief. Phenomenal\nconservatives and dogmatists tend to agree with the paradigm\nexternalist in rejecting the requirement that one grasp a connection\nbetween one\u2019s epistemic grounds or evidence and the proposition\nbelieved (though they deny that external conditions like reliability\ndiscussed below are also needed for justification). However,\nexternalists typically allow that in principle one could have a\nfoundational belief in the absence of any appearance or seeming. Some\nepistemologists have combined some modest internal requirements with\nexternalist ones in their accounts of epistemic justification (see,\nfor example, Alston 1989 and Steup 2004).\n\nWhile the externalist defends radically different views than those of\nclassical foundationalists, the structure of knowledge and\njustification that emerges from such theories is still often a\nfoundationalist structure. We might first illustrate the point by\nexamining the view defended by the most prominent of the externalists,\nAlvin Goldman\u2019s\n reliabilism.[6]\n The fundamental idea behind reliabilism is strikingly simple.\nJustified beliefs are reliably produced beliefs. Reliably produced\nbeliefs are beliefs that are the product of a reliable process, and a\nreliable process is one that yields beliefs that are usually true (or\nwould usually be true if enough of them were\n generated).[7]\n Justified beliefs are worth having because justified beliefs are\nprobably true.\n\nGoldman initially distinguished two importantly different sorts of\njustified beliefs\u2014those that result from belief-independent\nprocesses and those that result from belief-dependent processes. The\nformer are processes that take as their \u201cinput\u201d stimuli\nother than beliefs; the latter are beliefs produced by processes that\ntake as their input at least some other beliefs. So, for example, it\nis possible that we have evolved in such a way that when prompted with\ncertain sensory input we immediately and unreflectively reach\nconclusions about external objects. And we may live in a world in\nwhich beliefs about the external world produced in this way are\nusually true (or would usually be true if enough of them were\ngenerated). Such beliefs will be justified by virtue of being the\nproduct of reliable belief-independent processes. This is basically\nthe \u201cbase clause\u201d of the reliabilist\u2019s analysis, a\nprinciple of foundational or noninferential justification: if a belief\nis the product of a reliable belief-independent process, then it is\njustified. Reliabilists generally add to this a condition requiring,\nin effect, that there be no defeaters available to the\nsubject\u2014e.g., no good reason or justification to think that the\nbelief is false, unreliable or untrustworthy. (Specifying the needed\n\u201cno defeater\u201d condition in the base clause without using\nepistemic terms like \u2018justification\u2019 and\n\u2018reason\u2019 is a nontrivial matter. Goldman (1979) proposes\nadding the condition that there be no reliable belief-withholding\nprocess available to the subject.) These foundational beliefs can in\nturn be taken as input for reliable belief-dependent processes in\norder to generate still more justified beliefs. A belief-dependent\nprocess is \u201cconditionally\u201d reliable if its output beliefs\nare usually (or would usually) be true if the relevant input beliefs\nare true. The output beliefs of conditionally reliable\nbelief-dependent processes are justified, provided that the input\nbeliefs are justified. This is basically the \u201crecursive\nclause\u201d of the reliabilist\u2019s analysis, a principle of\nnonfoundational or inferential justification: if a belief is the\noutput of a conditionally reliable belief-dependent process, and the\ninput beliefs are justified, then (absent defeaters) the output belief\nis justified.\n\nThe above is a crude sketch of Goldman\u2019s early\nreliabilism\u2014he later modified it to deal with a number of\nobjections. But the sketch is enough to bring out the foundationalist\nstructure inherent in a reliabilist account. The reliabilist actually\naccepts the first clause of PIJ, and avoids the epistemic regress by\nembracing a kind of justified belief that does not owe its\njustification to the having of other justified beliefs. Any undefeated\nbelief resulting from a reliable belief-independent process is\njustified. No other beliefs are involved in the justification. So,\nsuch beliefs are foundational.\n\nReliabilism might complicate our taxonomy. Some reliabilists might\nhold that some belief-dependent processes (taking other beliefs as\ninput) can provide justification without being inferential processes.\nAfter all, there\u2019s nothing about the reliability of a process\nthat requires that it involve anything like an inference. Indeed,\nperhaps some memorial processes, or certain sub-conscious processes,\nare conditionally reliable and so can provide justification (absent\ndefeaters). We will see in discussing objections in\n section 7.1,\n however, that this might lead to counterintuitive consequences. \n\nIt should be noted that Goldman (1979) himself denies that one could\ngive a strict definition of an evaluative or normative epistemic term\nlike \u2018justification\u2019 without using other, similar\nevaluative or normative terms. Still, he is interested in providing\n\u201csubstantive conditions\u201d, conditions that specify, in\nnon-epistemic terms, when a belief is justified. In that sense,\nGoldman remains interested in providing a general and substantive\ntheory of justification.\n\nWe have illustrated the way in which an externalist account of\njustified belief can exemplify a foundationalist structure by\nexamining one of the most prominent versions of externalism,\nreliabilism. But other versions of externalism are also implicitly or\nexplicitly committed to a version of foundationalism, or, at the very\nleast, give an account of justification that would enable one to\ndistinguish noninferential from inferential justification, direct from\nindirect knowledge. Consider, for example, a crude version of the\nso-called causal theory of knowledge according to which one knows a\nproposition when one believes it and the belief is caused (in the\n\u201cright\u201d way) by the very fact that makes true what is\nbelieved. On such an account one can distinguish causal chains leading\nto the belief in question that involve intermediate beliefs from those\nthat do not. Using this distinction, one can again define a\ndistinction between foundational and nonfoundational knowledge:\nroughly, the causes of belief that do not include other beliefs are\nthe ones that would be foundational\n knowledge.[8]\n\nExternalist versions of foundationalism are probably attractive to\nmany because they seem to allow at least the possibility of a much\nexpanded foundational base of justified beliefs. Unlike the Cartesian\nview, the reliabilist\u2019s distinction between foundational and\nnon-foundational belief has nothing to do with whether the beliefs\nare somehow infallible or infallibly justified. If nature has been\nco-operative enough to ensure the evolution of cognitive agents who\nrespond to their environmental stimuli with mostly true beliefs, then\nthere might be an enormous store of foundational knowledge upon which\nwe can draw in arriving at inferentially justified conclusions. On\nmost externalist accounts of foundational belief there are literally\nno a priori constraints on what might end up being\nfoundationally justified. Any proposition might have been believed as\nthe result of the operation of some conceivable sort of reliable\nbelief-forming process. Moreover, many epistemologists hold that\njustifiers must in some way be truth-conducive or probable, and the\nrequirement of reliability (or some other such external condition)\nmakes the connection to the truth explicit. In contrast, non-classical\ninternalist foundationalist views like phenomenal conservatism\nthreaten to sever the connection between justification and truth or\nprobability, for it is possible that propositions that seem true are\nmostly false.\n7. Objections to Externalist Versions of Foundationalism\n\nA full evaluation of externalist versions of foundationalism is far\nbeyond the scope of this entry (see the entry on\n internalist and externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n Here we must inevitably be selective, and focus on reliabilism for\nillustration (see entry on\n reliabilist epistemology).\n7.1 Challenges to Sufficiency: Norman and Truetemp\n\nThe very ease with which the externalist can potentially broaden the\nfoundational base of knowledge or justified belief is, ironically, one\nof the primary concerns of those philosophers unhappy with externalist\nepistemology. One of the best-known objections to externalism attempts\nto show that the externalist\u2019s conditions for foundational\nbelief are not sufficient for justification. Recall that for the\nreliabilist a belief is justified if it is the product of a reliable\nbelief-independent process and there are no defeaters for the belief\navailable to the subject. Consider BonJour\u2019s (1985: ch. 3) case\nof Norman: We can imagine that Norman is a highly reliable\nclairvoyant, that his clairvoyance produces a belief that the\nPresident is in New York. Suppose also that he does not realize that\nhe is a clairvoyant, and that he has no reasons or evidence for or\nagainst the belief or the reliability of whatever process produced it.\nIntuitively, Norman\u2019s belief is unjustified. Or consider\nLehrer\u2019s (1990) case of Truetemp, who, without knowing it, has a\nchip implanted in his head that produces very precise and highly\naccurate beliefs about the ambient temperature. Truetemp often gets\ntemperature beliefs from the operation of the chip, but he has never\nchecked their correctness. Intuitively, Truetemp\u2019s belief that\nthe temperature is now exactly 47 degrees is not justified.\nReliabilism seems to yield the wrong result, justifying too many\nbeliefs.\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to respond to such cases. One\nresponse is defended by Bergmann (2006: ch. 1 and 2) and was already\ndiscussed above in connection with regress problems for access\ninternalism\n (section 3.1).\n Proponents of the objection often claim that what the cases suggest\nis that there must be something the subject is aware of or has access\nto that makes a difference to his perspective on the truth or\nappropriateness of the belief. Bergmann argues that this requirement,\nas tempting or intuitive as it may be, leads to serious regress\nproblems. (For some replies on behalf of internalism, see Rogers and\nMatheson 2011, Hasan 2011, and Fales 2014.)\n\nMany others attempt to accommodate these intuitions in some way.\nGoldman (1986) argues that in the cases described it is natural to\nthink that subjects like Norman do have defeaters available, and this\nexplains our intuition to regard them as unjustified. However, many,\nincluding some other reliabilists, think it is easy to further specify\nor amend the cases to ensure that the defeaters are not available\n(Lyons 2009: 123\u20134). Some accept a modest form of internalism,\nintroducing a relatively weak access requirement, e.g., that the\nsubject must have an experience or accessible mental state that is in\nfact a reliable way to arrive at beliefs, though the subject need not\nhave access to the reliability of the experience (Alston 1989).\nHowever, there seem to be many possible cases, including versions of\nthe cases of Norman and Truetemp, where these conditions are satisfied\nbut the intuition is the same; we might suppose for example that some\nphenomenological sensation, like some unusual sort of itch, headache,\nor olfactory sensation, is in fact a highly reliable indicator of the\ntruth of their beliefs regarding the whereabouts of the President or\nthe ambient temperature. This intuitively makes no difference when\nthey are unaware that it is reliable (see Lyons 2009: 125).\n\nA more recent attempt to respond to the Norman and Truetemp cases adds\na restriction for basic or foundational beliefs: they must be\nperceptual beliefs, beliefs produced by a \u201cperceptual\nsystem\u201d (see Lyons 2009: ch. 4, for more on what counts as a\nperceptual system). Lyons (2009: ch. 5) argues that the original\nNorman case doesn\u2019t specify whether the belief is a product of a\nperceptual system, and in the Truetemp case it is the product of an\nimplanted chip and not a perceptual system; he also argues that once\nwe change the details to make the beliefs the result of perceptual\nsystems the intuitions seem to change. For example, imagine that\nNorman* is like Norman except that he belongs to an alien species all\nmembers of which have clairvoyant abilities, thanks to their evolved\nperceptual organs and reliable processes of information transfer.\nLyons claims that, intuitively, someone like Norman*\u2019s belief\nthat the President is in New York is justified, even if Norman* is not\naware of the existence or reliability of such processes.\n\nJust as the cases of Norman and Truetemp are designed to show that\nreliabilism makes getting foundational justification too easy, other,\nsimilar cases seem to show that reliabilism make getting\nnonfoundational justification too easy. Suppose, for example,\nthat while you are asleep a group of logician-neuroscientists implant\na device in your head that takes some of your highly reliable\nfoundational beliefs (say, introspective or perceptual beliefs) as\ninput and responds by selecting at random from a list of complex\ntheorems of logic and producing a belief in that theorem. Intuitively,\nsuch beliefs are not justified despite their high degree of\nreliability. (This example is taken from Lyons 2009: 126). One\nintuitive diagnosis is that the relation between the output beliefs\nand input beliefs is not evidential or inferential, or the process by\nwhich the output beliefs are generated is not an evidential or\ninferential one. The challenge for the reliabilist who wants to avoid\nsaying that such beliefs are justified, and avoid adding internalist\nconstraints, is to provide a better account of inferential processes.\nTo retain its externalism, the account must not have good inference\ndepend on awareness of or access to the connection between\npropositions believed.\n7.2 A Challenge to Necessity: The New Evil Demon Problem\n\nThe objections discussed above challenge the sufficiency of the\nexternalist\u2019s proposed conditions for justification. However,\neven if the above counterexamples to sufficiency are met, we might\nquestion whether the externalist\u2019s conditions capture something\nessential to or necessary for foundational justification, or for the\njustification of other beliefs on the basis of foundational ones. Is\nunconditional, belief-independent reliability, for example, really\nnecessary for justification at the foundational level? And is\nconditional, belief-dependent reliability really necessary for the\njustification of other beliefs?\n\nThe \u201cnew evil demon problem\u201d (Lehrer and Cohen 1983; Cohen\n1984) challenges the claim that externalist conditions like\nreliability really are necessary. Suppose that there is a subject that\nis just like you in all internal respects, except that while your\nbeliefs are (let\u2019s assume) reliably produced, your twin\u2019s\nor counterpart\u2019s are not, for his or her beliefs are produced by\na powerful deceiving demon. Intuitively, your twin is no less\njustified than you are. But given that your twin\u2019s beliefs are\nnot reliable, the reliabilist must say that your twin\u2019s beliefs\nare not justified.\n\nVarious responses have been proposed. Some see no significant problem\nwith denying that the evil demon victim is justified. If this is not a\nblanket rejection of the appeal to intuitions, it would help to\naccount for the intuitions in some way, and some responses that appeal\nto an ambiguity in \u201cjustification\u201d could be understood as\ndoing just that. For example, Goldman (1988) says that the\ncounterpart\u2019s belief is \u201cweakly justified\u201d in the\nsense that the belief, though formed by an unreliable process, is one\nthe subject is epistemically responsible or blameless for having, but\nthe belief is not \u201cstrongly justified\u201d in the sense that\ninvolves reliability. This does not seem to be adequate, for\nintuitively, there is something positive about the deceived\ncounterpart\u2019s situation that is not captured by saying that he\nis epistemically responsible or blameless. A subject who reasons in\naccordance with principles that are horribly defective in ways he\ncannot detect may have tried his best and be as epistemically\nblameless as an evil demon victim who attends carefully to his\nexperiences and follows good principles of reasoning, but\nthere\u2019s something clearly positive about the latter\u2019s\nepistemic situation that goes beyond epistemic blamelessness (see Audi\n1993: 28, and Pryor 2001: 117 for discussion of this point). Some\nexternalists like Bach (1985) and Engel (1992) posit a similar sort of\nambiguity between doxastic and personal justification, i.e., between a\nbelief\u2019s being justified and a person\u2019s\nbeing justified in holding the belief, so that the demon victim is\njustified in believing as he does, but his beliefs are not justified.\nKvanvig and Menzel (1990) object that a person\u2019s being justified\nin believing something entails that their belief is justified, so that\nthe distinction cannot help with the problem, but Littlejohn (2009)\nargues that there is no such entailment, that the distinction between\npersonal and doxastic justification is coherent and well-motivated,\nand that it can help with the new evil demon problem.\n\nRather than simply deny the intuition, or explain it away by positing\nan ambiguity, a number of reliabilists attempt to accommodate the\nintuition by amending the conditions for justification. An earlier\nresponse by Goldman (1986) attempts to defend \u201cnormal worlds\nreliabilism\u201d according to which a subject\u2019s belief is\njustified if the process producing the belief is reliable in normal\nworlds, where a \u201cnormal world\u201d is, roughly, a world where\nour general beliefs about the actual world are true. It is no surprise\nthat Goldman himself was quick to give this up. One obvious worry with\nthis response is that it rules out even the possibility that\n\u201cabnormal\u201d processes like clairvoyance be justified.\nAnother is that it rules out the possibility that our general beliefs\nabout the world are unjustified (Pollock and Cruz 1999: 115). More\nrecently, some have suggested more sophisticated amendments to the\nconditions or to the sort of reliability required so as to accommodate\nthe intuition while avoiding the problems of normal worlds reliabilism\n(see Comesa\u00f1a 2002; Majors and Sawyer 2005; Henderson and\nHorgan 2006).\n8. The Problem of Easy Knowledge\n\nWe end by presenting the \u201cproblem of easy knowledge\u201d that\nhas been raised against both internalist and externalist alternatives\nto classical foundationalism (see Cohen 2002 for an initial\nformulation of the problem). The problem as presented there has two\nmain forms. The first involves cases of deductive closure. Suppose, to\nuse an example from Cohen (2002), that I am looking to acquire a red\ntable for my room and do not want to end up with a table that only\nlooks red\u2014e.g., a white table illuminated by red lights. Suppose\nthat upon looking at a particular table I find that it seems red to\nme. If phenomenal conservatism is true, then I can arrive at\nknowledge, or at least justified belief, by the following simple\ninference:\n\nThis table is red. (Formed on the basis of perception.)\nIf this table is red then it is not a white table illuminated by\nred lights.\nSo, this table is not a white table illuminated by red\nlights.\n\n\nThe same goes for the following inference:\n\nI have a hand. (Formed on the basis of a perception.)\nIf I have a hand, then I am not a handless brain in a vat being\nfed illusory experiences of hands.\nSo, I am not a handless brain in a vat being fed illusory\nexperiences of hands.\n\n\nThe problem is that it seems implausible that I could come to be\njustified in believing\u2014let alone know\u2014that the table is\nnot a white table illuminated by red lights merely on the\nbasis of its looking or seeming to be red. Of course, I may and often\ndo have independent reasons to trust that the colors of tables are\nnormally the way they look (colored lights are rare, I don\u2019t\nnotice any such lights, etc.), and the above argument makes no mention\nof that. But given phenomenal conservatism or dogmatism, a perceptual\nseeming alone would confer justification for beliefs of the form (1)\nin the absence of defeaters, whether or not one had good independent\nreasons to take the seeming to be trustworthy. Similarly, given\nreliabilism, a reliable perceptual process alone would confer\njustification for beliefs of form (1) in the absence of defeaters. The\nsame applies to the second inference: it is implausible that I could\ncome to be justified in believing that I am not a handless\nbrain-in-a-vat that merely seems to have hands on the basis of a\nperception or perceptual seeming that I have hands.\n\nIt is difficult to see how these views can deny that (3) could be\njustified in this way. Let\u2019s make this explicit: suppose that in\neach case (1) is indeed noninferentially justified for me on the basis\nof the corresponding seeming or reliable perceptual process, that I\nknow the obvious entailment (2) a priori, and that on the basis of\nthis I infer (3). Suppose also that we accept the following\nintuitively plausible principle of closure: if S is justified\nin believing that P, knows that P entails that\nQ, and infers on the basis of this that Q, then\nS is justified in believing that Q. (This is a\nprinciple that phenomenal conservatives and dogmatists themselves tend\nto accept. A few externalists, such as Dretske (1970) and Nozick\n(1981) deny the closure principle at work in the objection, but many\nexternalists are reluctant to deny that something like it holds, for\nthey do not want to deny that we could be justified in inferring (3)\nfrom (1).) It then follows that I am justified in believing (3). The\nobjector who uses this against phenomenal conservatism or reliabilism\ntakes the lesson here to be that mere seemings or reliable processes\n(respectively) cannot be a source of foundational or noninferential\njustification. Justification can\u2019t be that easy.\n\nThe problem of easy knowledge (or easy justification) comes in a\nsecond form as well: phenomenal conservatism and reliabilism allow one\nto acquire justification in the reliability of one\u2019s perceptual\nappearances in a way that appears to be illegitimate: by relying on\nthose very appearances themselves. If phenomenal conservatism is true,\nthen I can arrive at knowledge or at least justified belief in the\nreliability of my apparent perceptions in the following way:\n\n\nP. (Formed on the basis of a perceptual seeming that\nP)\nIt seems to me that P. (Formed by introspection)\nQ. (Formed on the basis of a perceptual seeming that\nQ)\nIt seems to me that Q. (Formed by introspection)\netc\u2026\n\n\nTherefore (probably), my perceptual seemings are true.\n\n\nGiven some plausible principle of justification by induction, I can\ninfer from the premises that my perceptual seemings are (probably)\nreliable. The problem is that it is intuitively implausible that I\ncould come to acquire justification for the reliability of my seemings\nby relying on the very seemings whose reliability I am attempting to\njustify. But it\u2019s not clear how the phenomenal conservative can\ndeny that this is a legitimate way to acquire justification in the\nreliability of one\u2019s seemings.\n\nExternalists also seem vulnerable to the second form of the problem of\neasy knowledge. They must apparently allow that a circular\ntrack-record argument could provide justification for belief in the\nreliability or trustworthiness of fundamental sources of belief. For\nexample, the reliabilist can rely on perception to justify the\nreliability of perception, memory to justify the reliability of\nmemory. And it seems implausible that one could acquire justification\nfor the reliability of such sources in this way (see Vogel 2008b for\nan argument against reliabilism along these lines).\n\nOne possible reply is to grant that such arguments are\nquestion-begging and epistemically useless if presented to someone who\ndoubts the reliability or trustworthiness of such seemings or apparent\nperceptions, but hold that it can still provide a subject who lacks\nthat doubt with justification. While the argument is question-begging\nagainst the skeptic, that is no reason to deny that one could, in the\nabsence of defeaters, acquire knowledge or justification on the basis\nof such arguments (Pryor 2004; Markie 2005; Bergmann 2008). However,\nsome object that such arguments remain intuitively\nproblematic\u2014the arguments seem not to justify at all, whether or\nnot they should persuade skeptics. (Cohen 2005; see also Vogel 2008a:\n539\u201342, for further examples of cases for which dogmatism allows\nsubjects to have justification that they really lack).\n\nOne might begin to wonder whether the problem of easy knowledge is a\nproblem for all foundationalist views if it is a problem for\nany. Indeed, some have argued that classical foundationalists are in\nno better a position than phenomenal conservatives and externalists\nwith respect to the problem, for they too will have to allow that one\ncould rely on acquaintance with facts to justify the existence and\ntrustworthiness of acquaintance. First, consider a parallel case of\ndeductive closure:\n\n\nThis is a pain. (Formed on the basis of acquaintance)\nIf this is a pain, then it is not a mere itch that I am mistaking\nfor a pain.\nSo, this is not a mere itch that I am mistaking for a pain.\n\n\nAnd a parallel case of circularity:\n\nP. (Formed on the basis of my acquaintance with the fact\nthat P)\nI am acquainted with the fact that P. (Formed on the\nbasis of my acquaintance with the fact that I am acquainted with the\nfact that P)\nQ. (Formed on the basis of my acquaintance with the fact\nthat Q)\nI am acquainted with the fact that Q. (Formed on the\nbasis of my acquaintance with the fact that I am acquainted with the\nfact that Q.)\netc.\n\n\nTherefore (probably), acquaintance is a source of true beliefs.\n\n\nClassical foundationalists might respond that the problem is not one\nof permitting some source to justify propositions about itself or its\nepistemic credentials. The problem is that some alleged sources make\nthe justification implausibly easy. Classical foundationalism does\nnot; the intuition that the knowledge or justification acquired is\nimplausibly easy or unsatisfying in the argument forms just presented\nis absent or at least much weaker (see Fumerton 2006). The problem\nthat classical foundationalism faces is that it makes justification\ntoo hard, not too easy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aikin, Scott F., 2011, <em>Epistemology and the Regress\nProblem</em>, New York: Routledge.", "Alston, William P., 1989, <em>Epistemic justification: Essays in\nthe theory of knowledge</em>, Ithaca: Cornell University Press.", "Aristotle, <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, Jonathan Barnes (trans.),\nsecond edition, translated with a commentary, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1956.", "Armstrong, David, 1973, <em>Belief, Truth and Knowledge</em>,\nLondon: Cambridge University Press.", "Audi, Robert, 1993, <em>The Structure of Justification</em>, New\nYork: Cambridge University Press.", "Ayer, A.
