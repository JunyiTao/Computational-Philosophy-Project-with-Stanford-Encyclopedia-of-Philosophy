    "main_text": "Pedagogical Writings\n2. Pedagogical Writings\n\nApart from Mary, a Fiction and The Cave of Fancy\nWollstonecraft\u2019s early writings were of a pedagogical nature (Jones 2020). These\nreveal the profound influence John Locke had on Wollstonecraft\u2019s\nthought, and several of the arguments of his Some Thoughts\nConcerning Education (1693) are echoed in Wollstonecraft\u2019s\nconception of morality and the best manner to inculcate it in\nindividuals at the earliest possible age. The opening paragraph of her\nThoughts on the Education of Daughters speaks of the duty\nparents have to ensure that \u2018reason should cultivate and govern\nthose instincts which are implanted in us to render the path of duty\npleasant\u2014for if they are not governed they will run wild; and\nstrengthen the passions which are ever endeavouring to obtain\ndominion\u2014I mean vanity and self-love.\u2019 Similarly, the\nbeginning of her Original Stories from Real Life stated its\nauthor\u2019s intent, namely to seek \u2018to cure those faults by reason,\nwhich ought never to have taken root in the infant mind. Good habits,\nimperceptibly fixed, are however far preferable to the precepts of reason; but\nas this task requires more judgement than generally falls to the lot\nof parents, substitutes must be sought for, and medicines given, when\nregimen would have answered the purpose better\u2019.\nWollstonecraft\u2019s prescriptions to counter the deplorable education she\nthought her contemporaries were inflicting on their children takes the\nform of a tale about two girls, Mary and Caroline. At the beginning of\nthe story, the reader finds the girls left to the management of\nignorant servants (one of Locke\u2019s great bugbears), but they are\neventually placed under the tuition of a woman of tenderness and\ndiscernment. The book shows how the latter succeeds in teaching\ncontemptuous Mary and vain Caroline to avoid anger, exercise\ncompassion, love truth and virtue, and respect the whole of God\u2019s\ncreation.  It is important to note however that whilst Locke advocated home education to shield boys from the bad influences to which they might be subject at school, Wollstonecraft was mostly inclined to think the opposite on the grounds that children needed to be with persons of their own age.  In an ideal world, boys and girls would be educated together in schools. Many of these concerns would appear again in her Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792): indeed Sandrine Berg\u00e8s reads this work primarily as a treatise on education (Berg\u00e8s 2013).\n\nThat reason must rule supreme could easily appear to be a running theme of Wollstonecraft\u2019s\nworks written prior to her sojourn in Revolutionary France and, all\nthe more, prior to her travels through Scandinavia. It is stressed in\nher Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Other\ncontinuities between her Thoughts on the Education of\nDaughters and the Vindication include her insistence that girls and\nyoung women be made to acquire \u2018inner resources\u2019 so as to\nmake them as psychologically independent as possible. The\nThoughts also reveals Wollstonecraft\u2019s conviction that\nuniversal benevolence is the first virtue, as well as her faith in a\nprovidentially ordained universe. She enjoined her readers to prepare\ntheir children for \u2018the main business of our lives\u2019,\nthat is, the acquisition of virtue, and, unsurprisingly given her own\nhistory, she urged parents to strengthen their children\u2019s characters\nso as to enhance their capacity to survive personal tragedies.\nSelf-mastery was thus the aim of education and it was the duty of\nparents to ensure that their children received it.  However, she insisted that there was a time for everything, including for the development of each of the mind\u2019s faculties, not least the imagination.  Ultimately, she wanted children and young people to educated in such a way as to have well balanced minds in strong and healthy bodies. That mind and body\nneeded to be exercised and prepared to face the inevitable hardships of life is\nthe fundamental point of her of her pedagogical works (Tomaselli 2020).\n",
