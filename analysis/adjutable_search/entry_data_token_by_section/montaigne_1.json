    "main_text": "Work\n2. Work \n\n  Montaigne wrote three books of Essays. (\u201cEssay\u201d\nwas an original name for this kind of work; it became an appreciated\ngenre soon after.) Three main editions are recognized: 1580 (at this\nstage, only the first two books were written), 1588, and 1595. The\nlast edition, which could not be supervised by Montaigne himself, was\nedited from the manuscript by his adoptive daughter Marie de\nGournay. Till the end of the XIXth century, the copy text for all new\neditions was that of 1595; Fortunat Strowski and shortly after him\nPierre Villey dismissed it in favor of the \u201cBordeaux\ncopy\u201d, a text of the 1588 edition supplemented by manuscript\nadditions.[1]\nMontaigne enriched his text continuously; he preferred to add for the\nsake of diversity, rather than to \ncorrect.[2]\n The unity of the work and the order of\nevery single chapter remain problematic. We are unable to detect\nobvious links from one chapter to the next: in the first book,\nMontaigne jumps from \u201cIdleness\u201d (I,8) to\n\u201cLiars\u201d (I,9), then from \u201cPrompt or slow\nspeech\u201d (I,10) to \u201cPrognostications\u201d (I,11). The\nrandom aspect of the work, acknowledged by the author himself, has\nbeen a challenge for commentators ever since. Part of the brilliance\nof the Essays lies in this very ability to elicit various\nforms of explanatory coherence whilst at the same time defying\nthem. The work is so rich and flexible that it accommodates virtually\nany academic trend. Yet, it is also so resistant to interpretation\nthat it reveals the limits of each interpretation.\n\n  Critical studies of the Essays have, until recently, been\nmainly of a literary nature. However, to consider Montaigne as a\nwriter rather than as a philosopher can be a way of ignoring a\ndisturbing thinker. Indeed, he shook some fundamental\naspects of Western thought, such as the superiority we assign to man\nover\n animals,[3]\n to European civilization over\n \u201cBarbarians\u201d,[4]\n or to reason as an alleged universal standard.  A\ntradition rooted in the 19th century tends to relegate his work to\nthe status of literary impressionism or to the expression of a\nfrivolous subjectivity. To do him justice, one needs to bear in\nmind the inseparable unity of thought and style in his work.\nMontaigne\u2019s repeated revisions of his text, as modern editions show with\nthe three letters A, B, C, standing for the three main editions,\nmirror the relationship between the activity of his thought and\nthe Essays as a work in progress. The Essays display\nboth the laboriousness and the delight of thinking. \nIn Montaigne we have a writer whose work is deeply infused by \nphilosophical thought. One verse out of sixteen in Lucretius\u2019\n De natura rerum is quoted in the\n Essays.[5]\n If it is true, as Edmund Husserl said, that philosophy is a shared\nendeavor, Montaigne is perhaps the most exemplary of philosophers\nsince his work extensively borrows and quotes from others.  Montaigne\nmanaged to internalize a huge breadth of reading, so that his\nerudition does not appear as such.  He created a most singular work,\nyet one that remains deeply rooted in the community of poets,\nhistorians, and philosophers. His decision to use only his own\njudgment in dealing with all sorts of matters, his resolutely distant\nattitude towards memory and knowledge, his warning that we should not\nmix God or transcendent principles with the human world, are some of\nthe key elements that characterize Montaigne\u2019s position. As a\nhumanist, he considered that one has to assimilate the classics, but\nabove all to display virtue, \u201caccording to the opinion of\nPlato, who says that steadfastness, faith, and sincerity are real\nphilosophy, and the other sciences which aim at other things are only\npowder and\n rouge.\u201d[6]\n\n",
