    "main_text": "Can The Cognitivist/Non-cognitivist Distinction Be Sustained? || Sophisticated Non-cognitivism vs. Sophisticated Cognitivist Relativism\n5.1 Sophisticated Non-cognitivism vs. Sophisticated Cognitivist Relativism\n\nOne way to push the point is to challenge the non-cognitivist to\ndistinguish non-cognitivism from cognitivist relativism. A speaker\nrelativist is in a particularly good position to highlight the\nsuggestion that there is little difference between sophisticated\nnon-cognitivism and cognitivism. Both speaker relativists and\nnon-cognitivists can say that the appropriateness of a moral judgment\ndepends on a speaker\u2019s attitudes. If the non-cognitivist\nsuggests that moral judgments predicate properties in a secondary way\n(perhaps to handle embedding), the cognitivist relativist can agree.\nAnd the theories can agree that the property predicated is determined\nas a function of the speaker\u2019s moral attitudes. Thus it may be\ndifficult to say precisely what the difference between the views is\n(Dreier 1999). However, the responses used to explain why\nnoncognitivism doesn\u2019t immediately entail relativism in section\n4.3 would also seem to show that the difficulty can be overcome.\n",
