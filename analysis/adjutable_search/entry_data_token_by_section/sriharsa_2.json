    "main_text": "Method || Refutation-Arguments\n1.2 Refutation-Arguments\n\nThroughout The Sweets of Refutation\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s aim is to argue against\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers by means of what he calls\nrefutation-arguments (kha\u1e47\u1e0dana-yukti).\nRefutation-arguments against definitions are supposed to reveal that\nthe relevant definitions are inadequate. In cases where no adequate\ndefinition is available for an entity, the relevant entity to be\ndefined cannot be specified, i.e., distinguished from those things\nthat are distinct from\n it.[8]\n This follows from the thesis, endorsed by V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra,\nthat the purpose of a definition is to specify the definiendum by\ndistinguishing it from things that are distinct from it. So, if\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s refutation-arguments are successful\nin showing that there exists no adequate definition for any of the\nontological, logical, and epistemological categories that the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher seeks to define, then she\nwill have failed to specify those categories that are essential to her\ntheoretical enterprise.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a describes two ways in which his\nrefutation-arguments could be useful. First of all, they are supposed\nto favor the kind of non-dualism\u2014defended by supporters of\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta\u2014which says that the self or consciousness\nis the only thing that is ultimately exists. According to\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, the refutation-arguments show that we cannot\nestablish the ultimate reality of the variegated world as it appears\nin perceptual experience, the world which appears to be constituted by\na plurality of things and whose existence we assume for our everyday\npractical purposes (KKh 63). This is because we cannot adequately\ndefine the various ontological and epistemological\ncategories\u2014such as difference, causation,\nrelation, knowledge, perception,\netc.\u2014using which we make sense of that world and our epistemic\nrelationship with it. It is in this sense that the variegated world as\nit appears to us in perception is indeterminable\n (anirvican\u012bya).[9]\n And in the absence of such definitions, the distinctions\namongst these constituents of reality and our methods of knowing them\ncannot be treated as ultimately real. This in turn will clear room for\nnon-dualism.\n\nSecond, even though the main purpose of refutation-arguments is to\nshow that the plurality of things in the world shouldn\u2019t be\ntreated as ultimately real, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a claims that they\nmay also prove useful for the opponents of non-dualism. For instance,\nif one is a Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher who admits the\nreality of methods of knowing, etc., then one may use at least some of\nthe refutation-arguments to rule out alternative views held by other\nphilosophers, including the views of their predecessors within the\nsame school as well as their opponents. Moreover, even in the kind of\ndebate where one is engaged in the pursuit of truth and doesn\u2019t\nmerely seek to defeat one\u2019s opponent, one would have to respond\nto refutation-arguments before one could arrive at one\u2019s own\nview. Thus, refutation-arguments have universal application (KKh\n123\u2013125).\n\nWhile offering his arguments, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a explicitly\nappeals to three criteria of adequacy for definitions which he takes\nto be common ground between himself and his opponents.\n\nThe first is a criterion of extensional adequacy: an\nadequate definition of a kind K should state the conditions\nthat are necessary and sufficient for being an instance of K.\nFirst of all, the definition shouldn\u2019t fail to apply all\ninstances of K. Second, it shouldn\u2019t be\nunderextended, i.e., there shouldn\u2019t be cases of\nK where the definition doesn\u2019t apply. Third, it\nshouldn\u2019t be overextended, i.e., there shouldn\u2019t\nbe things that are not of kind K where the definition\napplies.\nThe second criterion of adequacy for definitions\u2014also widely\nendorsed by Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers- is the\ncriterion of non-circularity: an adequate definition\nmust not be circular, i.e., a definition of a kind K must not\nmention any kind K* such that in order to know what K*\nis, an agent would (directly or indirectly) need a prior understanding\nof what K is.\nThe third criterion of adequacy that \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\ninvokes is slightly more controversial. It is the criterion of\nuniformity (anugama): an adequate definition of a kind\nK should identify a single property that uniformly\ncharacterizes all instances of K. This criterion entails that\nan adequate definition of a kind K should be\nnon-disjunctive, i.e., it should not list a number of\ndifferent properties A, B, C,\u2026, satisfying\none of which is sufficient for being an instance of K, but\nsatisfying any one of which may not be necessary for being an instance\nof K. \n\n\nThe latter two criteria of adequacy seem to appeal to the two\ndifferent conceptions of definitions mentioned above.\n\nThe criterion of non-circularity seems to follow straightforwardly\nfrom the conception of definition on which a definition is supposed to\nlay down a distinguishing property of a kind K, which in turn\ncan help us distinguish instances of K from all other objects.\nThis seems to entail that the definition of K can\u2019t\nappeal directly or indirectly back to K itself; for then it\nwould be unhelpful when it comes to distinguishing instances of\nK from other entities. But if the purpose of a definition is to\ncapture the application-conditions of the definiendum term, then the\ncriterion of non-circularity doesn\u2019t make much sense; for the\nconcept on the basis of which the definiendum term is used might be\nunanalyzable independently of itself, so no non-circular definition\nmight be available for it.\n\nBy contrast, the criterion of uniformity seems to be connected with\nthe second conception of definition on which the purpose of a\ndefinition is to establish the use of the definiendum term. If the\nexpression is applied to a number of distinct entities, we might\nexpect that these entities share some unifying property in virtue of\nwhich the same expression is applied to them. A\ndefinition\u2014insofar as it is intended to capture the\napplication-conditions of the definiendum term\u2014would be\ninadequate if it didn\u2019t capture this unifying\n property.[10]\n But if the purpose of a definition is only to lay down a\ndistinguishing property for the definiendum, then the criterion of\nuniformity doesn\u2019t make much sense; for the only distinguishing\nproperty for the definiendum may well be a motley disjunction of\ndifferent properties.\n",
