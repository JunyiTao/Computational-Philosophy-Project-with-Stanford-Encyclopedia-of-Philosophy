Life\n\n Saadya Gaon (Saadya ben Joseph, known in Arabic as Sa'id \u2018ibn\nYusuf al-Fayy\u00fbm\u00ee) was born in Fayy\u00fbm (upper Egypt)\nin 882 and died in Baghdad in 942. Theologian, philosopher and rabbi,\nSaadya's legacy includes a number of philosophical and theological\ntreatises, 2 Arabic translations of the Bible, a [mostly non-extant]\nBiblical commentary in Arabic, various rabbinical, mathematical, and\ngrammatical writings, a Hebrew dictionary, liturgical poems and a\nJewish prayer book. \n\n A key figure in the life of the Jewish community, Saadya's rabbinic\ncareer included influential involvement in a controversial Jewish\ncalendrical reform and a contested rise to the position of head Rabbi\nat the Sura Academy.\n\n In his general philosophical comportment, Saadya upholds the need for\nand importance of reason, even in a religious context of revelation\nand faith. In fact, in his commitment to the importance of human\nreason (including the sense in which reason can judge the rightness of\nat least a number of Biblical commands and prohibitions), Saadya's\ntheological ideas may be said to reflect Islamic Kal\u00e2m\nsensibilities (in particular, the teachings of the\nMu\u2018t\u00e2zilites). \n",
