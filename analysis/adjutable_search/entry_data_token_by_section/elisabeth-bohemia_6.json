    "main_text": "Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes || Mathematics and Natural Philosophy\n4.3 Mathematics and Natural Philosophy\n\nIn letters of November 1643, shortly after the initial exchange\nconcerning the union of mind and body, Descartes sets Elisabeth the\nclassic geometrical problem of the three circles or Apollonius\u2019s\nproblem: to find a circle that touches each of three given circles on\na plane. While Elisabeth\u2019s solution is no longer available,\nDescartes\u2019s comments indicate that Elisabeth had already mastered\ntechniques of algebraic geometry. She is thought to have learned them\nfrom Johan Stampioen\u2019s textbook. Elisabeth\u2019s approach to the problem\nseems to have differed from Descartes\u2019s own, and Descartes remarks on\nher solution having a symmetry and transparency in virtue of its using\nonly a single variable that his lacked. Elisabeth\u2019s recognized\nmathematical acumen is also evidenced by her involvement in the hiring\nof Frans van Schooten to the mathematical faculty at Leiden and John\nPell\u2019s effort to enlist her help in understanding Descartes\u2019s\nGeometry.\n\nIn 1644, Descartes dedicated his Principles of Philosophy to\nElisabeth. In that work, Descartes not only presents his metaphysics\nin textbook form, he also lays out his physics in some detail.\nElisabeth responds to the dedication with gratitude, but also by\noffering criticisms of Descartes\u2019s accounts of magnetic attraction and\nthe heaviness of mercury.\n\nAlso in the correspondence, Elisabeth shows herself to have a keen\ninterest in the workings of the physical world and in efficient causal\nexplanations of natural phenomena: she criticizes Kenelm Digby\u2019s\nreading of Descartes; she requests the works of Hogelande and Regius;\nshe reports on various observed phenomena, and in particular on\ndiseases and cures, while looking for acceptable efficient causal\nexplanations of them. This commitment efficient causal explanations\nleads her to try to disseminate Cartesian physics in Germany.\n\nEbbersmeyer (2021), as noted above, demonstrates how Elisabeth\u2019s\ninterest in natural philosophy was not limited to her correspondence\nwith Descartes, and moreover, continued after Descartes\u2019s\ndeath.\n\nShapiro (2019) argues that with respect to natural philosophy,\nElisabeth ought to be understood as a Cartesian. Kambouchner (2021)\nargues that consideration of Elisabeth\u2019s views on practical and\ncivil life shows that in this respect Elisabeth is not a Cartesian,\nthough he also suggests that Descartes himself may not be a dogmatic\nCartesian either.\n",
