    "main_text": "Anti-expertise || The Knower Paradox\n5.1 The Knower Paradox\n\nDavid Kaplan and Richard Montague (1960) think the announcement by the\nteacher in our surprise exam example is equivalent to the\nself-referential\n\n(K-3)\n Either the test is on Monday but you do not know it before\nMonday, or the test is on Wednesday but you do not know it before\nWednesday, or the test is on Friday but you do not know it before\nFriday, or this announcement is known to be false. \n\n\nKaplan and Montague note that the number of alternative test dates can\nbe increased indefinitely. Shockingly, they claim the number of\nalternatives can be reduced to zero! The announcement is then\nequivalent to\n\n(K-0)\nThis sentence is known to be false. \n\n\nIf (K-0) is true then it known to be false. Whatever is known to be\nfalse, is false. Since no proposition can be both true and false, we\nhave proven that (K-0) is false. Given that proof produces knowledge,\n(K-0) is known to be false. But wait! That is exactly what (K-0) says\n\u2013 so (K-0) must be true.\n\nThe (K-0) argument bears a suspicious resemblance to the liar paradox.\nSubsequent commentators sloppily switch the negation sign in the\nformal presentations of the reasoning from \\(K{\\sim}p\\) to\n\\({\\sim}Kp\\) (that is, from \u2018It is known that not-\\(p\\)\u2019,\nto \u2018It is not the case that it is known\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019). Ironically, this garbled\ntransmission results in a cleaner variation of the knower:\n\n(K)\nNo one knows this very sentence. \n\n\nIs (K) true? On the one hand, if (K) is true, then what it says is\ntrue, so no one knows it. On the other hand, that very reasoning seems\nto be a proof of (K). Believing a proposition by seeing it to be\nproved is a sufficient for knowledge of it, so someone must know (K).\nBut then (K) is false! Since no one can know a proposition that is\nfalse, (K) is not known.\n\nThe skeptic could hope to solve (K-0) by denying that anything is\nknown. This remedy does not cure (K). If nothing is known then (K) is\ntrue. Can the skeptic instead challenge the premise that proven is a\nsufficient for knowing it? This solution would be particularly\nembarrassing to the skeptic. The skeptic presents himself as a\nstickler for proof. If it turns out that even proof will not sway him,\nhe bears a damning resemblance to the dogmatist he so frequently\nchides.\n\nBut the skeptic should not lose his nerve. Proof does not always yield\nknowledge. Consider a student who correctly guesses that a step in his\nproof is valid. The student does not know the conclusion but did prove\nthe theorem. His instructor might have trouble getting the student to\nunderstand why his answer constitutes a valid proof. The intransigence\nmay stem from the prover\u2019s intelligence rather than his\nstupidity. L. E. J. Brouwer is best known in mathematics for his\nbrilliant fixed point theorem. But a doubtful reading of Immanuel\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics led Brouwer retract his proof.\nBrouwer also had philosophical doubts about the Axiom of Choice and the\nLaw of Excluded Middle. Brouwer persuaded a minority of mathematicians\nand philosophers, known as intuitionists, to emulate his abstention\nfrom non-constructive proofs. This led them to develop constructive\nproofs of theorems that were earlier proved by less informative means.\nEverybody agrees that there is more to learn from a proof of an\nexistential generalization that proceeds from a proved instance than\nfrom an unspecific reductio ad absurdum of the corresponding\nuniversal generalization. But this does not vindicate the\nintuitionists\u2019s refusal to be persuaded by the reductio ad\nabsurdum. The intuitionist, even in the eyes of the skeptic, has\ntoo high a standard of proof. An excessively high standard of proof\ncan prevent knowledge by proof. \n\nThe logical myth that \u201cYou cannot prove a universal\nnegative\u201d is itself a universal negative. So it implies its own\nunprovability. This implication of unprovability is correct but only\nbecause the principle is false. For instance, exhaustive inspection\nproves the universal negative \u2018No adverbs appear in this\nsentence\u2019. A reductio ad absurdum proves the universal\nnegative \u2018There is no largest prime number\u2019.\n\nTrivially, false propositions cannot be proved true. Are\nthere any true propositions that cannot be proved true?\n\nYes, there are infinitely many. Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorem demonstrated that any system that is strong enough to express\narithmetic is also strong enough to express a formal counterpart of\nthe self-referential proposition in the surprise test example\n\u2018This statement cannot be proved in this system\u2019. If the\nsystem cannot prove its \u201cG\u00f6del sentence\u201d, then this\nsentence is true. If the system can prove its G\u00f6del sentence, the\nsystem is inconsistent. So either the system is incomplete or\ninconsistent. (See the entry on\n Kurt G\u00f6del.)\n\nOf course, this result concerns provability relative to a system. One\nsystem can prove another system\u2019s G\u00f6del sentence. Kurt\nG\u00f6del (1983, 271) thought that proof was not needed for knowledge\nthat arithmetic is consistent.\n\nJ. R. Lucas (1964) claims that this reveals human beings are not\nmachines. A computer is a concrete instantiation of a formal system.\nHence, its \u201cknowledge\u201d is restricted to what it can prove.\nBy G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, the computer will be either\ninconsistent or incomplete. However, any human being could\nhave consistent and complete knowledge of arithmetic. Therefore, necessarily, no\nhuman being is a computer.\n\nCritics of Lucas defend the parity between people and computers. They\nthink we have our own G\u00f6del sentences (Lewis 1999,\n166\u2013173). In this egalitarian spirit, G. C. Nerlich (1961)\nmodels the student\u2019s beliefs in the surprise test example as a\nlogical system. The teacher\u2019s announcement is then a G\u00f6del\nsentence about the student: There will be a test next week but you\nwill not be able to prove which day it will occur on the basis of this\nannouncement and memory of what has happened on previous exam days.\nWhen the number of exam days equals zero the announcement is\nequivalent to sentence K.\n\nSeveral commentators on the surprise test paradox object that\ninterpreting surprise as unprovability changes the topic. Instead of\nposing the surprise test paradox, it poses a variation of the liar\nparadox. Other concepts can be blended with the liar. For instance,\nmixing in alethic notions generates the possible liar: Is \u2018This\nstatement is possibly false\u2019 true? (Post 1970) (If it is false,\nthen it is false that it is possibly false. What cannot possibly be\nfalse is necessarily true. But if it is necessarily true, then it\ncannot be possibly false.) Since the semantic concept of validity\ninvolves the notion of possibility, one can also derive validity liars\nsuch as Pseudo-Scotus\u2019 paradox: \u2018Squares are squares,\ntherefore, this argument is invalid\u2019 (Read 1979). Suppose\nPseudo-Scotus\u2019 argument is valid. Since the premise is\nnecessarily true, the conclusion would be necessarily true. But the\nconclusion contradicts the supposition that argument is valid.\nTherefore, by reductio, the argument is necessarily invalid. Wait! The\nargument can be invalid only if it is possible for the premise to be\ntrue and the conclusion to be false. But we have already proved that\nthe conclusion of \u2018Squares are squares, therefore, this argument\nis invalid\u2019 is necessarily true. There is no consistent judgment\nof the argument\u2019s validity. A similar predicament follows from\n\u2018The test is on Friday but this prediction cannot be soundly\ndeduced from this announcement\u2019.\n\nOne can mock up a complicated liar paradox that resembles the surprise\ntest paradox. But this complex variant of the liar is not an\nepistemic paradox. For the paradoxes turn on the semantic\nconcept of truth rather than an epistemic concept.\n",
