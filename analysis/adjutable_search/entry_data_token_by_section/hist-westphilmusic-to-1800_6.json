    "main_text": "Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages\n2. Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages\n\nDespite spanning about one thousand years, the period that goes from\nlate Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages brought little new to\nWestern philosophy of music.\n\nA prominent feature of this period is the emergence of the Christian\nworldview. Christian thinking on music adapts some of the views it had\ninherited from Greek Antiquity, chief among them the Pythagorean\nharmony of the spheres and the idea that music may influence\ncharacter.\n\nThe medieval approach to music is biased toward the point of view of\nthe theoretician. Music is typically grouped together with scientific\ndisciplines. The sensory pleasure of the listener is rarely remarked\nupon, and at times considered with suspicion. The individuality and\ncreativity of the composer is also neglected, and the role of\nperforming musicians almost entirely ignored or dismissed (Schuller\n1988, and Young forthcoming (chapter 2) are extensive introductions to\nmedieval musical aesthetics).\n",
