    "main_text": "\n\nZhu Xi, the preeminent Neo-Confucian (daoxue) master of the\nSouthern Song (1126\u20131271), is generally ranked as second only to\nConfucius (551\u2013479 BCE) in influence and as rivaling Zhuangzi\n(fourth century BCE) in philosophic acumen in the Chinese\nphilosophical tradition. A leading scholar and classicist as well as\nsharp intellect and devoted practitioner, Zhu Xi worked out a\nphilosophically compelling synthesis of the ideas of the Northern Song\n(960\u20131126 CE) masters Zhou Dunyi (1017\u201373), Zhang Zai\n(1020\u201377), and the brothers Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107) and Cheng\nHao (1032\u201385). Intriguingly, his idea of a holistic synthetic\napproach itself may have been inspired in part by Huayan Buddhism\n(Ivanhoe 2000:\n 47\u201349).[1]\n Over time, Zhu Xi\u2019s Neo-Confucian synthesis proved to be a\npotent philosophic catalyst for his intellectual supporters and\nopponents alike, until the fall of Imperial China in 1911 and beyond.\nHis influence gradually extended to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, as\nwell, each of which adapted his thought along with the Confucian\nclassics and traditions in its own distinctive way. Besides synthesizing key\nNorthern Song Neo-Confucian ideas, Zhu researched and reflected on the\nreceived Five Classics (Changes, Odes, History, Rites, and\nSpring and Autumn Annals), and compiled, edited, and\ncommented on a compendium of essential Confucian texts, the Great\nLearning (Daxue), the Analects (Lunyu)\nof Confucius, the Book of Mencius (Mengzi), and the\nDoctrine of the Mean (Zhongyong), titled the\nFour Books (Sishu). He also prepared an edition of\nthe Songs of the South (Chuci) to be appended to the\nOdes.\n\nNotably, from the Great Learning Zhu adapted and distilled\nthe methodology of investigating things to extend knowledge while from\nthe Mean he stressed attuning oneself to attain utmost\npropriety. Investigating things incorporated reading and classical\nstudies but ensured one\u2019s practical grasp of and personal\nresonance with the pulse of life: nature and phenomena as well as\nsociety and human relations and concerns (Gardner 1986, 1990).\nAttuning oneself involved reverent concentration and mindful\nreflection and practice. A century later, Yuan dynasty\n(1271\u20131368) officialdom adopted Zhu Xi\u2019s edition of the\nFour Books as the basis for the Imperial Examination System,\nin effect canonizing it until the termination of the imperial\nexamination system toward the end of the Qing dynasty\n(1644\u20131911) in 1908. The change from the Five Classics\nto the Four Books as the basis of the imperial examination\nsystem resulted in a reform and renewal of the Confucian tradition and\noutlook. It effected a restoration of Confucius\u2019 original\nconcern with personal ethical cultivation, realization, and practice\nfrom the more bureaucratic, careerist approach taken by many\nConfucians of the succeeding Han and Tang dynasties (206 BCE\u2013905\nCE) that had weakened the tradition spiritually. Zhu Xi\u2019s spirit\nand thought were deeply rooted in the original teachings of Confucius\nand his early school, as well as in the seminal ideas of the Northern\nSong masters, and exerted a profound influence in China and around\nEast Asia for centuries.\n",
