    "main_text": "Literature and Art\n5. Literature and Art\n\nOver and above his concern with aesthetics as a philosophical theme,\nthe engagement with literature and art has been a continuing feature\nthroughout Gadamer\u2019s life and work and, in particular, Gadamer\nhas written extensively on poets such as Celan, Goethe,\nH\u00f6lderlin, and Rilke (see especially Gadamer 1994b, 1997c).\nGadamer\u2019s engagement with art is strongly influenced by his\ndialogue with the history of philosophy, and he draws explicitly on\nHegel as well as Plato. At the same time, that engagement provides an\nexemplification of Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics as well as a means to\ndevelop it further, while his hermeneutic approach to art itself\nconstitutes a rethinking of aesthetics through the integration of\naesthetics into hermeneutics (on Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics in general, see\nAthos, 2013; Davey, 2013; Nielsen, 2023).\n\nIn contrast to much contemporary aesthetics, Gadamer takes the\nexperience of beauty to be central to an understanding of the nature\nof art and in the final pages of Truth and Method, he\ndiscusses the beautiful as that which is self-evidently present to us\n(as \u2018radiant\u2019) exploring also the close relationship\nbetween the beautiful and the true. Of particular importance in his\nwriting about art and literature are the three ideas that appear in\nthe subtitle to \u2018The Relevance of the Beautiful\u2019 (1986b):\nart as play, symbol and festival. The role of play is a central notion\nin Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic thinking generally, providing the basis\nfor Gadamer\u2019s account of the experience both of art and\nunderstanding (see\n Aesthetics and Subjectivism\n above). The symbolic character of the artwork is seen, by Gadamer,\nnot in terms of any form of simple \u2018representationalism\u2019,\nbut instead in terms of the character of art as always showing\nsomething more than is literally present to us in the work (this\naspect of art as referring outside itself is also taken up by Gadamer\nelsewhere in relation to the character of art as\n\u2018imitation\u2019\u2014mimesis). The artwork, no\nmatter what its medium, opens up, through its symbolic character, a\nspace in which both the world, and our own being in the world, are\nbrought to light as a single, but inexhaustibly rich totality. In the\nexperience of art, we are not merely given a \u2018moment\u2019 of\nvision, but are able to \u2018dwell\u2019 along with the work in a\nway that takes us out of ordinary time into what Gadamer calls\n\u2018fulfilled\u2019 or \u2018autonomous\u2019 time. Thus the\nartwork has a festive, as well as symbolic and playful character,\nsince the festival similarly takes us out of ordinary time, while\nopening us up to the true possibility of community. Gadamer returned\nspecifically to the question of art in his late essay (from 1992)\n\u2018The Artwork in Word and Image: \"So True, So Full of\nBeing\"\u2019(Gadamer, 2007, pp. 192\u2013224) in which he draws out the\ncharacter of interpretation as not something additional to the work or\nart, but that in which the artwork is itself realized. In so doing,\nGadamer also enlarges and expands the idea of interpretation that was\nevident in his earlier works, drawing on the experience of reading in\na way that not only shows the richness of textual engagement, but also\nbrings out the dynamic, performative, and essentially\nother-involving-character of all interpretation.\n\nAlthough much of Gadamer\u2019s writing on art focuses on poetry, as well\nas the visual arts, he has also addressed questions of music (see\nGadamer 2021, 2022), and Gadamer\u2019s work is increasingly evident in\ncontemporary philosophy of music, especially in discussions of musical\nperformance and improvisation (see eg. Benson, 2003; McAuliffe, 2023;\nNielsen, 2023). Gadamer\u2019s emphasis on the dynamic and performative\ncharacter of understanding has an obvious relevance to music, but\nmusic itself provides a valuable source for thinking about the\ncharacter of art and understanding in general.\n",
