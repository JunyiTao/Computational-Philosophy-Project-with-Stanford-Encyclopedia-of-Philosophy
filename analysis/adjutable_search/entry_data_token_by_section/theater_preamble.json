    "main_text": "\n\nIn contrast to Plato\u2019s well-known disparagement of theatrical\npractices (in Republic, Books III and X, for example),\nAristotle held in the Poetics that tragedy in theatrical\nperformance, perhaps tragedy in particular, could have therapeutic\nvalue. Whether what he meant was a kind of cognitive therapy or a form\nof psychological therapy is a question that has vexed scholars to this\nday; and it turns on how one understands two terms: katharsis\nand mimesis (Schaper 1968; Golden 1973; Diamond 1989; Lear\n1992; Woodruff 1992).  This dispute is interesting first because it\nreflects the fact that theater has been a topic of philosophical\ndispute, investigation, use, or illustration since near the beginning\nof Western philosophy in the ancient Greek world. Second, its terms\ncontinue to have influence over current disputes within theater\nstudies and performance theories (Puchner 2013). Finally, and\nprimarily, it links descriptive metaphysical issues, such as what\ntheater is by its nature, with normative issues, such as the value of\ntheatrical performances within a culture. Several recent philosophical\nworks emphasizing descriptive issues have attempted to understand just\nwhat is going on in theatrical performances and other performance arts\n(Saltz 1991a; Thom 1992; Osipovich 2006; Hamilton 2007; D. Davies\n2011). This entry will focus largely on topics that are similar to or\nare themselves the issues examined in these works.\n\nPhilosophy of theater, like much else in aesthetics and philosophy of\nart, is wide in its scope and makes contact with many other\ndisciplines within philosophy and outside of it. This entry should\nhelp make that clear. The first section of this entry will provide\nbackground information and describe an important normative issue\nderived from certain metaphysical and epistemic positions. The next\nthree sections sort the issues in a way familiar among analytic\nphilosophers in aesthetics and philosophy of art, according to whether\nthe issues concern a) descriptions of instances of the art form, b)\nunderstanding (and interpretation) of instances of the form, and c)\nevaluations of such instances. However, some elements of theater not\ndiscussed in this entry are otherwise interesting in their own right,\nfor example: the relationship between theater and music (and the\nspecial case of musical theater); the relationship between theater and\ndance (as a related but historically distinct kind of performance);\nthe relationship between theater and architecture (which yields a\nfocus upon scenography); the relation between acting and portraiture\n(people describe acting as \u201cportraying a character\u201d); the\nrelationship between narratives in theater and narratives in video\ngames (and questions about immersion and interactivity); the\nrelationship between acting and story-telling; the relationship\nbetween theater and narratology (and the distinction between narrative\nand non-narrative theater); the relationship between theater with live\nhuman actors and theater with puppets; and so on.\n",
