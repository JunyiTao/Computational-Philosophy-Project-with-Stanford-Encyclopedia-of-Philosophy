    "main_text": "Butch/FTM Border Wars and Border Zone Dwellers\n7. Butch/FTM Border Wars and Border Zone Dwellers\n\nTo a large extent, (non-trans) feminist discussion of trans issues\nseems to have circulated around the perceived problematic status of\ntrans people (and, in particular, transsexuals). Moreover, there has\ngenerally been an over-emphasis on MTFs in particular. So it is worth\ndrawing attention to significant (trans) feminist views which have\nemerged from disputes in subaltern communities among various non-gender\nnormative individuals, particularly those assigned female at birth.\n\nTensions among FTM-identified and butch lesbian-identified people had\nbeen leading to politically charged disputes about the significance of\nmasculinity. For some lesbians, FTMs represented a betrayal of\nwomanhood and a desertion of lesbian community. For some FTMs, butch\nmasculinity was a lesser and perhaps \u201cartificial\u201d\nmanifestation of masculinity in contrast to the masculinity exemplified\nby FTMs. Such competing ways of understanding masculinity led to what\nhave sometimes been called \u201cButch/FTM border wars\u201d\n(Halberstam and Hale, 1998).\n\nSuch conflict found articulation in a dispute over the gender identity\nand sexual orientation of a young masculine-presenting\nfemale-assigned-at birth individual, Brandon (Teena), who was slain in\nHumbolt, Nebraska in 1993, when discovered to be \u201creally a\nwoman.\u201d (Hale [1998a] argues that there is not good evidence that\nBrandon used the name Brandon Teena. It has, however, become a\ncommon way of referring to this individual. I place the name\nTeena in parentheses to flag the problematic nature of this\nlinguistic construction). An article in the Village Voice, by\nDonna Minkowitz entitled \u201cLove Hurts. Brandon Teena Was a Woman\nWho Lived and Loved as a Man. She was Killed for Carrying It\nOff\u201d, led to the formation of Transexual Menace, a trans activist\ngroup, which protested the perceived invalidation of Brandon's\nidentity as transgender person (Prosser 1997, 316).\n\nSimilar tensions arose in the academic literature. Judith\nHalberstam's ground-breaking essay \u201cF2M: The Making of\nFemale Masculinity\u201d (1994) was the target of considerable\ncriticism from within FTM communities (Halberstam 1998a). Jay\nProsser's \u201cNo Place Like Home: The Transgendered Narrative\nof Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues\u201d (1995)\naimed to offer an academic reply to Halberstam's perceived\ninvalidation of FTM self-identities.\n",
