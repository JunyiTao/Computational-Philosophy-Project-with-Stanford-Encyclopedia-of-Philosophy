    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s central doctrines\n1. Plato\u2019s central doctrines\n\nMany people associate Plato with a few central doctrines that are\nadvocated in his writings: The world that appears to our senses is in\nsome way defective and filled with error, but there is a more real and\nperfect realm, populated by entities (called \u201cforms\u201d or\n\u201cideas\u201d) that are eternal, changeless, and in some sense\nparadigmatic for the structure and character of the world presented to\nour senses. Among the most important of these abstract objects (as\nthey are now called, because they are not located in space or time)\nare goodness, beauty, equality, bigness, likeness, unity, being,\nsameness, difference, change, and changelessness. (These\nterms\u2014\u201cgoodness\u201d, \u201cbeauty\u201d, and so\non\u2014are often capitalized by those who write about Plato, in\norder to call attention to their exalted status; similarly for\n\u201cForms\u201d and \u201cIdeas.\u201d) The most fundamental\ndistinction in Plato\u2019s philosophy is between the many observable\nobjects that appear beautiful (good, just, unified, equal, big) and\nthe one object that is what beauty (goodness, justice, unity) really\nis, from which those many beautiful (good, just, unified, equal, big)\nthings receive their names and their corresponding characteristics.\nNearly every major work of Plato is, in some way, devoted to or\ndependent on this distinction. Many of them explore the ethical and\npractical consequences of conceiving of reality in this bifurcated\nway. We are urged to transform our values by taking to heart the\ngreater reality of the forms and the defectiveness of the corporeal\nworld. We must recognize that the soul is a different sort of object\nfrom the body\u2014so much so that it does not depend on the\nexistence of the body for its functioning, and can in fact grasp the\nnature of the forms far more easily when it is not encumbered by its\nattachment to anything corporeal. In a few of Plato\u2019s works, we\nare told that the soul always retains the ability to recollect what it\nonce grasped of the forms, when it was disembodied prior to its\npossessor\u2019s birth (see especially Meno), and that the\nlives we lead are to some extent a punishment or reward for choices we\nmade in a previous existence (see especially the final pages of\nRepublic). But in many of Plato\u2019s writings, it is\nasserted or assumed that true philosophers\u2014those who recognize\nhow important it is to distinguish the one (the one thing that\ngoodness is, or virtue is, or courage is) from the many (the many\nthings that are called good or virtuous or courageous )\u2014are in a\nposition to become ethically superior to unenlightened human beings,\nbecause of the greater degree of insight they can acquire. To\nunderstand which things are good and why they are good (and if we are\nnot interested in such questions, how can we become good?), we must\ninvestigate the form of good.\n",
