    "main_text": "Dance, Lived Experience and Somatic Awareness\n3. Dance, Lived Experience and Somatic Awareness\n\nThere are fields of philosophy, particularly in the Continental,\npragmatic, and non-Western traditions, that treat art as both activity\nand as experiential phenomena. These phenomenological kinds of\nphilosophy treat lived experience, including bodily and somatic\nexperience, as something that can provide legitimate descriptive or\ncausal evidence for philosophic claims. (See, e.g., Dewey 1934;\nMerleau-Ponty 1945 and 1964; along with Berleant 1991; Bresnahan\n2014b; \n Foultier and Roos 2013 (Other Internet Resources); \n Johnson 2007; Katan 2016; Lakoff and\nJohnson 1999; and Merritt 2015 for work on dance following Dewey and\nMerleau-Ponty. For more on phenomenological approaches to dance see\nAlbright 2011; Fraleigh 1996 [which also contains quite a lot of\nmaterial on the history of dance in aesthetics], 2000, and 2018;\nFranko 2011b; and Sheets-Johnstone 1966 and 2015. Cf. Ness 2011 for an\naccount of a shift in dance away from phenomenology with\nFoucault.)\n\nRichard Shusterman has developed his own phenomenological theory,\nwhich he calls \u201csomaesthetics\u201d, in order to explain an\nembodied engagement with art, including dance, that includes a sort of\nkinesthetic awareness of interior, somatic processes (see 2008, 2009,\n2011a, 2011b, 2011c and 2012). (For more on dance and somatic\nengagement see Eddy 2002; Fraleigh 2015; Weber 2019; and Williamson et\nal. 2014. See also LaMothe 2009; Pakes 2003, 2017a, and 2019; and\nParvainen 2002 for work on the related field of dance, the body and\nepistemology.)\n",
