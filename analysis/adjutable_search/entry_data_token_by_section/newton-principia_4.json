Newton's Laws of Motion\n\n\nThe designation \u201claws of motion\u201d had been used in the\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in the late\n1660s for principles governing motion under impact put forward by\nChristopher Wren, John Wallis, and Christiaan Huygens. Only the\nfirst of the three laws Newton gives in the Principia\ncorresponds to any of these principles, and even the statement of it is\ndistinctly different: Every body perseveres in its state of being\nat rest or of moving uniformly straight forward except insofar as it is\ncompelled to change its state by forces impressed. This\ngeneral principle, which following the lead of Newton came to be called\nthe principle or law of inertia, had been in print since Pierre\nGassendi's De motu impresso a motore translato of 1641.\nNewton probably first encountered it in print when he read Descartes'\nPrincipia, where it is comprised by his first two \u201claws of\nnature\u201d and is used immediately to assert \u201cthat any body which is\nmoving in a circle constantly tends to move away from the center of the\ncircle which it is describing.\u201d This is the basis for Descartes\nconcluding that some form of unseen matter (namely the vortices) must\nbe in contact with the planets, for otherwise they would go off in a\nstraight line. It is the first of the three hypotheses from which\nHuygens develops his theory of \u201cfalling heavy bodies and their motion\nin a cycloid\u201d in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673: If\nthere were no gravity, and if the air did not impede the motion of\nbodies, then any body will continue its given motion with uniform\nvelocity in a straight line. Newton had adopted it as a\n\u201chypothesis\u201d in the registered version of \u201cDe Motu,\u201d though stated\nwithout reference to impressed forces: Every body under the sole\naction of its innate force moves uniformly in a straight line\nindefinitely unless something extraneous hinders it. The\nstriking difference in the formulation in the Principia versus\nthe one in \u201cDe Motu\u201d \u2014 and, for that matter, versus all earlier\nformulations in print \u2014 is the reference to impressed forces. In\nall earlier formulations, any departure from uniform motion in a\nstraight line implied the existence of a material impediment to the\nmotion; in the more abstract formulation in the Principia, the\nexistence of an impressed force is implied, with the question of how\nthis force is effected left open.\n\n\nThe modern F=ma form of Newton's second law nowhere occurs in\nany edition of the Principia even though he had seen his\nsecond law formulated in this way in print during the interval between\nthe second and third editions in Jacob Hermann's Phoronomia of\n1716. Instead, it has the following formulation in all three\neditions: A change in motion is proportional to the motive force\nimpressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force\nis impressed. In the body of the Principia this law\nis applied both to discrete cases, in which an instantaneous impulse\nsuch as from impact is effecting the change in motion, and to\ncontinuously acting cases, such as the change in motion in the\ncontinuous deceleration of a body moving in a resisting medium.\nNewton thus appears to have intended his second law to be neutral\nbetween discrete forces (that is, what we now call impulses) and\ncontinuous forces. (His stating the law in terms of proportions\nrather than equality bypasses what seems to us an inconsistency of\nunits in treating the law as neutral between these two.)\n\n\nThe obvious question with the second law is what Newton means by \u201ca\nchange in motion.\u201d If he had meant a change in what we call\nmomentum \u2014 that is, if he had meant, in modern notation,\n\u0394mv \u2014 the proper phrasing would have been \u201ca\nchange in the quantity of motion.\u201d In a passage composed in the\nearly 1690s when Newton was intending to restructure the\nPrincipia, he explained what he meant:\n\n\n\nIf the body A should [see Fig. 1], at its place A\nwhere a force is impressed upon it, have a motion by which, when\nuniformly continued, it would describe the straight line Aa,\nbut shall by the impressed force be\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\ndeflected from this line into another one Ab and, when it\nought to be located at the place a, be found at the place\nb, then because the body, free of the impressed force, would\nhave occupied the place a and is thrust out from this place by\nthat force and transferred therefrom to the place b, the\ntranslation of the body from the place a to the place\nb will, in the meaning of this Law, be proportional to this\nforce and directed to the same goal towards which this force is\nimpressed. Whence, if the same body deprived of all motion and\nimpressed by the same force with the same direction, could in the same\ntime be transported from the place A to the place B,\nthe two straight lines AB and ab will be parallel and\nequal. For the same force, by acting with the same direction and\nin the same time on the same body whether at rest or carried on with\nany motion whatever, will in the meaning of this Law achieve an\nidentical translation towards the same goal; and in the present case\nthe translation is AB where the body was at rest before the\nforce was impressed, and ab where it was there in a state of\nmotion. [M, 541]\n\n\n\nIn other words, the measure of the change in motion is the distance\nbetween the place where the body would have been after a given time had\nit not been acted on by the force and the place it is after that\ntime. This is in keeping with the measure universally used at the\ntime for the strength of the acceleration of surface gravity, namely\nthe distance a body starting from rest falls vertically in the first\nsecond. The only special provision that Newton has to make is for\nnon-uniform continuously acting forces, for which, in accord with Lemma\n10, he takes the distance AB to vary \u201cat the very\nbeginning of the motion in the squared ratio of the\n times.\u201d[21]\n\n\nIf this way of interpreting the second law seems perverse, keep in\nmind that the geometric mathematics Newton used in\nthe Principia \u2014 and others were using before him\n\u2014 had no way of representing acceleration as a quantity in its\nown right. Newton, of course, could have conceptualized acceleration\nas the second derivative of distance with respect to time within the\nframework of the symbolic calculus. This indeed is the form in which\nJacob Hermann presented the second law in his Phoronomia of\n1716 (and Euler in the 1740s). But the geometric mathematics used in\nthe Principia offered no way of representing second\nderivatives. (Newton employed curvature \u2014 that is, the circle\n\u201ctouching a curve\u201d \u2014 in place of the second\nderivative with respect to distance throughout\nthe Principia). Hence, it was natural for Newton to stay with\nthe established tradition of using a length as the measure of the\nchange of motion produced by a force, even independently of the\nadvantage this measure had of allowing the law to cover both discrete\nand continuously acting forces (with the given time taken in the limit\nin the continuous case).\n\n\nUnder this interpretation, Newton's second law would not have seemed\nnovel at the time. The consequences of impact were also being\ninterpreted in terms of the distance between where the body would have\nbeen after a given time, had it not suffered the impact, and where it\nwas after this time, following the impact, with the magnitude of this\ndistance depending on the relative bulks of the impacting bodies.\nMoreover, Huygens's account of the centrifugal force (that is, the\ntension in the string) in uniform circular motion in his Horologium\nOscillatorium used as the measure for the force the distance\nbetween where the body would have been had it continued in a straight\nline and its location on the circle in a limiting small increment of\ntime; and he then added that the tension in the string would also be\nproportional to the weight of the body. So, construed in the\nindicated way, Newton's second law was novel only in its replacing bulk\nand weight with\n mass.[22]\n\n\nIn the early stages of his work on the Principia Newton had\nidentified three logically equivalent alternatives for the third law:\nthe action-reaction principle he ultimately chose, the principle we\ncall conservation of linear momentum (Corollary 3 in the\nPrincipia), and the principle that \u201cthe common center of\ngravity of two or more bodies does not change its state whether of\nmotion or of rest as a result of the actions of the bodies upon one\nanother\u201d (Corollary 4). Huygens had stated that both of these\nprinciples follow from his solution for spheres in collision, and the\ncenter of gravity principle, as Newton emphasizes, amounts to nothing\nmore than a generalization of the principle of inertia. Even\nthough his third law was novel in comparison with these other\n two,[23]\nNewton\nnevertheless chose it and relegated the other two to corollaries.\nTwo things can be said about this choice. First, the third law is\na local principle, while the two alternatives to it are global\nprinciples, and Newton, unlike those working in mechanics on the\nContinent at the time, generally preferred fundamental principles to be\nlocal, perhaps because they pose less of an evidence burden.\nSecond, with the choice of the third law, the three laws all expressly\nconcern impressed forces: the first law authorizes inferences to the\npresence of an impressed force on a body, the second, to its magnitude\nand direction, and the third to the correlative force on the body\nproducing it. In this regard, Newton's three laws of motion are\nindeed axioms characterizing impressed force. Real forces, in\ncontrast to such apparent forces as Coriolis forces (of which Newton\nwas entirely aware, though of course not under this name), are forces\nfor which the third law, as well as the first two, hold, for only by\nmeans of this law can real forces and hence changes of motion be\ndistinguished from apparent ones.\n\n\nNewton presents his first two laws as already \u201caccepted by\nmathematicians and confirmed by experiments of many kinds\u201d\n[P,\n 424].[24]\nFor the third law, by contrast, he\noffers a variety of forms of support, including experiments on\nimpact. One important element that becomes clear in his\ndiscussion of evidence for the third law \u2014 and also in Corollary 2 \u2014\nis that Newton's impressed force is the same as static force that had\nbeen employed in the theory of equilibrium of devices like the level\nand balance for some time. Newton is not introducing a novel\nnotion of force, but only extending a familiar notion of force.\nIndeed, Huygens too had employed this notion of static force in his\nHorologium Oscillatorium when he identified his centrifugal\nforce with the tension in the string (or the pressure on a wall)\nretaining an object in circular motion, in explicit analogy with the\ntension exerted by a heavy body on a string from which it is\ndangling. Huygens's theory of centrifugal force was going beyond\nthe standard treatment of static forces only in its inferring the\nmagnitude of the force from the motion of the body in a circle.\nNewton's innovation beyond Huygens was first to focus not on the force\non the string, but on the correlative force on the moving body, and\nsecond to abstract this force away from the mechanism by which it acts\non the body. Three steps were thus involved in passing from the\nalready familiar static forces to the more abstract Newtonian \u201cdynamic\u201d\nforces, one by Huygens and two by\n Newton.[25]\n\n\nThe continuity with Huygens's theory of centrifugal force is important\nin another respect. In his brief defense of the first two laws of\nmotion Newton remarks, \u201cWhat has been demonstrated concerning the times\nof oscillating pendulums depends on the same first two laws and first\ntwo corollaries, and this is supported by daily experience with clocks\u201d\n[P, 424]. In Huygens's Horologium\nOscillatorium, the only place any counterpart to the second law\nsurfaces is in the theory of centrifugal force and uniform circular\nmotion. The theory Huygens presents extends to conical pendulums,\nincluding a conical pendulum clock that he indicates has advantages\nover simple pendulum clocks. In the 1670s Newton had used a\nconical pendulum to confirm Huygens's announced value of the strength\nof surface gravity as measured by simple cycloidal and small-arc\ncircular\n pendulums.[26]\n(Huygens himself had measured the\nstrength of surface gravity with a conical pendulum, obtaining the same\nvalue to four significant figures as he had obtained with\nsimple\n pendulums.[27])\nThe precise agreement between these\ntwo theory-mediated measures of surface gravity, one of them predicated\non Newton's first two laws of motion and the other not, in fact\nconstituted the strongest evidence for the first two laws at the time\nthe Principia was first published. For, the simple\npendulum measure was known to be stable and accurate into the fourth\nsignificant figure. The evidence in hand for the first two laws, taken\nas a basis for measuring forces, was thus much stronger than has often\nbeen appreciated.\n\n\nSave perhaps for the attribution of the F=ma form of the\nsecond law to the Principia, the most widespread mistake about\nNewton's three laws of motion is that they alone sufficed for all\nproblems in classical mechanics. Those who developed what we now\ncall Newtonian mechanics during the eighteenth century at all times\nappreciated how far from the truth this is. Newton's three laws\nof motion suffice for problems involving what Euler dubbed\n\u201cpoint-masses.\u201d Indeed, once given the forces acting on a point\nmass, the three laws hold for all point-masses, including those that\nlie within bodies. But the three laws must be supplemented by\nfurther principles for a whole host of celebrated problems involving\nbodies, rigid or otherwise, that are not mere point-masses.\nPerhaps the simplest prominent example at the time was the problem of a\nsmall arc circular pendulum with two (or more) point-mass bobs along\nthe string. Huygens had solved this problem in the part of his\nHorologium Oscillatorium entitled \u201cThe Center of Oscillation,\u201d\nin the process providing the theoretical basis for using added masses\nto tune pendulum\n clocks.[28]\nThe reason why Newton's three laws of\nmotion have to be supplemented to solve this problem is easy to\nsee. Consider the case of a pendulum with two point-masses along\nthe length of a rigid string. The outer point-mass has the effect\nof reducing the speed of the inner one, versus what it would have had\nwithout the outer one, and the inner point-mass increases the speed of\nthe outer one. In other words, motion is transferred from the\ninner one to the outer one along the segment of the string joining\nthem. Once the force transmitted to each point-mass along the\nstring is known, Newton's three laws of motion are sufficient to\ndetermine the motion. But his three laws are not sufficient to\ndetermine what this force transmitted along the string is. Some\nother principle beyond them is needed to solve the problem. Which\nprinciple is to be preferred in solving this problem became a\ncelebrated issue extending across most of the eighteenth\n century.[29]\n",
