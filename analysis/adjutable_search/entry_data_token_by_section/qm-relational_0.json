    "main_text": "Main Ideas || Values of physical variables\n1.1 Values of physical variables\n\nThe starting point of RQM is that quantum mechanics is not about a\nwave function (or a quantum state) \\(\\psi\\); it is about values of\nphysical variables. The ontology assumed by RQM, accordingly, includes\nonly physical systems and variables that take values, as in classical\nmechanics. For instance, a real fact is the position of a particle\nhaving a certain value \\(x\\) at a certain time \\(t\\). Facts as this\none (\u201cthe particle is at \\(x\\) at time \\(t\\)\u201d) are called\n\u201cevents\u201d, or \u201cquantum events\u201d. Quantum theory\nis about events. However, in classical mechanics there are two general\nassumptions that are abandoned in quantum theory.\n\n(a) In classical mechanics it is assumed that all variables of a\nsystem have always a value at every time. RQM, on the contrary,\nassumes that this is in not the case in nature in general (Heisenberg\n1925; Kochen & Specker 1967). Rather, this is only an\napproximation that holds when disregarding quantum phenomena. Physical\nvariables acquire values only at some times, and have no value at the\nother times. Events, in other words, are discrete. This is the basic\nintuition that led Heisenberg to find the key to quantum mechanics in\n1925; that is, there are questions that make sense in classical\nmechanics, but have no significance in nature. For instance, the\nquestion \u201cWhat is the \\(y\\)-component of the spin of an electron\nwhen its \\(z\\)-component is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\hslash\\)?\u201d is\nmeaningless: neither it admits an operational definition, nor is it\nneeded for a realistic understanding of nature (see below, about\nrealism). When does then a generic variable \\(A\\) of a system \\(S\\)\nacquire a value? When does an event happen? The RQM answer is: when\nand only when the system \\(S\\) interacts with a second system \\(S'\\)\nand the effect of the interaction on \\(S'\\) depends on the variable\n\\(A\\). In RQM, this is what it means for a variable to have a\nvalue.\n\n(b) The second assumption of classical mechanics which is dropped in\nRQM is that there are variables that take absolute values, namely\nvalues independent from any other systems. Instead, RQM assumes that\nall (contingent) physical variables are relational. (The\ncontingent variables are those with in classical theory are\nrepresented by phase space functions.) Any value these variables take\nis always (implicitly or explicitly) labelled by a second physical\nsystem. If the variable \\(A\\) of a system \\(S\\) takes a value in the\ninteraction with a second systems \\(S'\\), the value it takes is only\nrelative to \\(S'\\). The actualisation of an event is always\nrelative to a system. The concrete meaning of this is the postulate\nabove, according to which future ways the system \\(S\\) affects \\(S'\\)\ndepend (probabilistically) on the values that variables of \\(S\\) have\ntaken with respect to \\(S'\\), but future ways the system \\(S\\)\naffect a third system \\(S''\\) do not. The ensemble of all events\nrelative to an arbitrary system \\(S'\\), together with the\nprobabilistic predictions these entail, is called the\n\u201cperspective\u201d of the \u201cobserver\u201d \\(S'\\).\n\nThe central claim at the basis of RQM is therefore that:\n\u201cdifferent observers can give different accounts of the same set\nof events\u201d (Rovelli 1996: 1643). Textbook quantum mechanics is a\ncomplete description of the perspective of a single observer, but it\ndisregards the effect of this observer system on the perspective of\nother systems. RQM emphasises the fact that the observer itself\nbehaves as a quantum system, when acting on other systems. The\nrelation between perspectives is discussed below.\n",
