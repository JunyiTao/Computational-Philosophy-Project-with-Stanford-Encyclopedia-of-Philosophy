    "main_text": "Justice for Bodin: Open and Closed Questions\n6. Justice for Bodin: Open and Closed Questions\nBiographies have attributed religious, political, and philosophical\ndoctrines to Bodin that he may have held. These historians have even\nused the word \u201cconversion\u201d\u2014a strong word in the\nsixteenth century\u2014to make their point. Rose writes of Bodin\u2019s\n\u201cconversion to Judaism\u201d; Moreau-Reibel and Rose of his\n\u201cconversion to the League,\u201d which according to Rose is an\n\u201cact of apostasy\u201d too. Bayle, Naef and Bouchez describe\nhis \u201cconversion to Protestantism,\u201d and Franklin of his\n\u201cconversion to absolutism.\u201d Likewise Bayle and Quaglioni\ndescribe Bodin\u2019s tendency towards religious dissimulation or\nnicodemism. Within the confines of a biography, we are limited to\naddress only the most important aspects of Bodin\u2019s character as a\npolitical actor including his adhesion to the League and his\nabandonment of the \u201cpolitiques.\u201d Concerning the first\npoint, his adhesion to the League, we have examined the Bodin\u2019s\nposition based on his own writings. The second point, Bodin\u2019s\nrelationship to the \u201cpolitiques,\u201d is based on suppositions\nwhich have become nearly a tradition in Bodin scholarship, and has\nbeen perpetuated and reinforced by generation after generation of\nhistorians. Unfortunately these historians have not sought sources on\nwhich to base this claim. In fact, there are no sources that support\nthis argument. Indeed, Bodin never said that he was a\n\u201cpolitique.\u201d Briefly addressing the heart of the matter,\nhistorians have sought to make Bodin a convinced partisan of religious\ntolerance. During Bodin\u2019s lifetime however, religious tolerance,\ndefined as civil tolerance and a legal admission of confessional\ndiversity within a country or city, was not the ideal it would later\nbecome after the eighteenth century. In the sixteenth\ncentury, it was men like S\u00e9bastian Castellion who extolled the\nco-existence of many religions, with which the reformed camp\ndisagreed. The struggle of the Huguenots from the beginning of the\ncivil wars, was to convert the king and realm to the true religion.\nTolerance was not an ideal since one cannot tolerate what one cannot\npossibly accept. For example how could one allow Christ to coexist\nwith Belial, or a false religion to coexist with the one and only true\nreligion?  No further proof of this conviction is needed than the\nfierce struggle both Calvin and Beza waged against Castellion. This\nexample causes one to ask the question: if Castellion supported\nfreedom of religion, why did the leaders of the Reformation, who\nprofessed the same desire, denounce him so fervently?  Because, in the\nreality, the French Reformers did not want freedom of religion which\ncould have \u201copened the door to all manner of sects and\nheresies,\u201d as Calvin said. At the beginning of the wars of\nreligion, they wanted to obtain the recognition of the reformed\nreligion as the sole religion in the realm. Yet, after thirty-six\nyears of war, and after the conversion of Henry of Navarre, they\nunderstood that their project was too ambitious and had to be\nlimited. Only through true religious tolerance could they convert the\nremainder of the kingdom at a later time.  The unity of faith, and\nCalvinist religious concord were the ideal of Reformers\ntoo. Concerning the \u201cpolitiques,\u201d we only have\ndescriptions of them from their adversaries who considered them\natheists and heathens. For instance they were accused of having no\nreligion because they were inclined to admit the definitive\ncoexistence of different forms of worship in the interest of civil\npeace. Nevertheless, why have modern historians, placed men, who they\nconsidered the \u201cmost liberal and sympathetic,\u201d such as\nBodin, Etienne Pasquier, Duplessis-Mornay, Pierre de Beloy and many\nothers in the party of the \u201cpolitiques.\u201d These historians\nhave projected their modern ideals of tolerance, religious freedom,\npluralism, and diversity on to the period of the Wars of\nReligion. Thus these scholars believed they had done a great service\nto the men of the past by presenting them as forerunners of the later\nvalues.  But, as we have seen, Bodin viewed confessional concord as\nthe means capable of returning religious, civil and political unity to\nthe kingdom. It should be recalled however that the problem was not\nthat of \u201cliberty of conscience,\u201d which the French\ngovernment had already guaranteed by edicts in 1563, but the liberty\nto worship. The freedom to worship is also at the heart of the\nquestion of tolerance. When Bodin and many of his contemporaries\nthought about tolerance, it was only as provisional tolerance with the\nhope of achieving civil peace and religious reunification in the\nfuture. For Bodin, concord was essential since it formed the\nfoundation of sovereignty and was necessary for the full exercise of\npower. \nTo be fair to Bodin, the offenses poured out against him by his\nmalicious contemporaries at the time of his adhesion to the League\nshould be analyzed and understood historically. The same goes for the\naccusations of treason, turn-coating, trickery, opportunism,\n\u201cthe charge of his reversal of his belief on religious\ntolerance,\u201d \u201chis slipperiness and lack of principle in\njoining the League,\u201d all of which we find today in his\nbiographies. Bodin\u2019s program of concord and unity was in opposition to\npermanent tolerance and established diversity in juridical, political,\nand theological questions, as we already seen. \n",
