    "main_text": "The Return || The Two Commands\n5.3 The Two Commands\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee often addresses the cosmic uniqueness of human\nbeings in terms of the command (amr), an important Koranic\nterm that has a strong bearing on the way in which theologians and\nphilosophers addressed the issue of determinism and free will, or\nnature and nurture. It was said earlier that the \u201cengendering\ncommand\u201d (al-amr al-takw\u00een\u00ee) is the\ncreative word \u201cBe!\u201d (kun) and that it turns\nnonexistent entities into existent entities. God addresses this\ncommand to all existent things without exception, and everything is\nobedient to it. It provides no way to distinguish between right and\nwrong, good and evil, better and worse, because all things are exactly\nwhat they must be. Everything manifests the Real, al-Haqq,\nand each is a specific face of God with its own haqq. From\nthis standpoint, nothing in the cosmos is\nb\u00e2til\u2014false, vain, or wrong.\n\nThe fact is, however, that human beings, created in the form of\nGod\u2019s all-comprehensive name, are always faced with choices.\nRational investigation is handicapped in its ability to choose the\ngood over the bad, the right over the wrong, the beautiful over the\nugly, the haqq over the b\u00e2til, because,\nwithout outside help, it cannot transcend the evanescent images that\nmake up the appearance of the cosmos. It has no access to the ultimate\ncriteria whereby the haqq of things\u2014their reality,\ntruth, rightness, and appropriateness vis-\u00e0-vis the\nReal\u2014can be discerned. In other words, the cosmic and human\nbooks cannot be interpreted rightly (bi\u2019l-haqq) without\nguidance (hud\u00e2) from the Real (al-haqq), the\nauthor of the engendering command. Guidance is precisely the function\nof the prophets, by means of whom God issues commandments and\nprohibitions. This act of issuing is called \u201cthe prescriptive\ncommand\u201d (al-amr al-takl\u00eef\u00ee), because it\nsets down principles and directives that need to be followed in order\nto discern the haqqs of things and act appropriately.\n\nThe engendering command brings the cosmos into existence, but the\ndivine attributes demand much more than life, awareness, desire,\npower, and other qualities that are presupposed by the existence of\nminerals, plants, and animals. Among the ontological possibilities\nactually present in the Essence and actually manifest in the universe\nare mercy, love, compassion, forgiveness, justice, fairness, wisdom,\nand many other moral and ethical traits whose significance only\nbecomes clear in human activity and interactions. All these are\nontological qualities, but, in order for them to become fully\nmanifest, the engendering command must give rise to the prescriptive\ncommand, which instructs people in the haqq of love, mercy,\nbeneficence, kindness, and other traits. Becoming rightly\ncharacterized by the divine names does not happen simply by the\nnatural course of events; it calls for the engagement of the will.\nOnly by choosing the haqq over the b\u00e2til,\nright over wrong, good over evil, can people realize the full\npossibilities of their own deiformity.\n\nBy making guidance available, the prescriptive command also provides\nthe possibility of error and misguidance. It is the occasion, in other\nwords, for the actualization of various possibilities of being and\nbecoming that are demanded by divine attributes such as severity,\nwrath, pride, and vengeance, not to speak of forgiveness and pardon.\nIn any case, human beings, through their own freedom, play a role in\nactualizing possibilities of the Divine Infinity that otherwise would\nhave no raison d\u2019\u00eatre, paradise and hell being the most\nsalient examples. Distinguishing between the two commands allows us to\ngrasp the difference between fact and value, between what is and what\nought to be. But these are two sides of the same self-disclosure of\nBeing. By issuing commands and prohibitions, the Real introduces\ncausal factors that force human beings to assume responsibility for\nwhat they will become on the moral and spiritual levels. This is why\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee says that people are \u201ccompelled to be\nfree\u201d (majb\u00fbr f\u00ee ikhtiy\u00e2rihim). The\ndegree to which they conform to the letter and spirit of the\nprescriptive command determines \u201cthe levels, stations, and\nstages\u201d that they will reach in the ascending arc of the Return;\nposthumously, their levels and stages will become differentiated in\nthe ascending levels of paradise and the descending levels of hell.\nWithout human (or analogous, all-comprehensive, free beings), an\ninfinity of ontological possibilities would not find their\nactualization. As Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee puts it, \u201cIf not for\nus, the next world would never become differentiated from this\nworld\u201d (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t,\n1911 edition, 3:253.21).\n",
