    "main_text": "Truth\n3. Truth\n\nThe other very important debate that Strawson was involved in the\nearly 1950s was that with Austin about truth. Viewed in terms of the\npolitics of Oxford philosophy at that time, the debate perhaps\nrepresents a power struggle between Austin, the hitherto acknowledged\nleader, and Strawson, the younger challenger. Philosophically,\nStrawson took exception to Austin\u2019s attempt (in Austin 1950) to\nformulate a reconstructed version of the correspondence theory of\ntruth. Austin\u2019s account of truth is complex, but, roughly, he\nheld that in saying that a statement is true one is saying that the\nstate of affairs which a particular kind of linguistic convention,\nwhich he called the referential conventions, ensure are picked out by\nthe use of the original sentence in the given circumstances, satisfy\nthe conditions which another sort of convention \u2014 called the\ndescriptive conventions \u2014 target the rest of the sentence onto.\nAustin\u2019s idea can be illustrated with an example. The sentence\n\u2018The television is broken\u2019 is governed by certain\nreferential conventions which target it onto some state of affairs in\nthe world involving a particular television set; there are also\ncertain descriptive conventions built into the sentence linking it to\na type of state of affairs (the containing-a-broken-television type);\nthe former state of affairs conforms to, or falls under, the\ndescriptively correlated type. Strawson\u2019s criticism principally\nalleges that Austin has no clear conception of what the supposed\nreferential conventions link sentences with. Is it objects \u2014\nsay, the television? If so, then that is not a state of affairs, and\ncertainly not a fact.\n\nStrawson also argues that facts and states of affairs should not be\nregarded as things in the world. He suggests that we employ such nouns\nas \u2018fact\u2019 and \u2018state of affairs\u2019 as\nnon-referential devices for expressing claims. Thus, I can say\n\u2018It is a fact that P\u2019 instead of simply saying\n\u2018P\u2019, but the former remark in no way introduces\nan entity beyond anything introduced in the second claim. (This might\nbe labelled a redundancy theory of facts.) Having queried the\nontology of Austin\u2019s account, Strawson, somewhat surprisingly\nseems prepared to allow that the conditions that Austin\u2019s\naccount incorporates are, in effect, correlated with the\ntruth of the sentence in question, but, he says, the fulfilment of\nthese conditions is not what we are claiming to obtain when\nwe say that it is true. It is simply obvious that remarks about truth\nare not remarks about linguistic conventions. This criticism\nseems to have a similar status to the central criticism of Russell.\nStrawson\u2019s point against Austin is that it is simply obvious\nthat the theory cannot be correct because it is obvious to us as\nlanguage users that when we speak of truth we are not talking about\nsuch things as referential (and descriptive) linguistic conventions.\nFinally, Strawson pointed out that Austin\u2019s account could only\napply to a limited range of statements. If I say \u2018There are no\nunicorns\u2019 what are the referential targets of my\nremark?\n\nStrawson\u2019s criticisms were taken by most people to have fatally\nwounded Austin\u2019s theory. The subsequent discussion occasioned by\ntheir debate primarily concerned some issues about the degree to which\nStrawson\u2019s criticisms as a whole were fair to Austin, and also\nwhether the approach to truth that Strawson himself favoured was\nadequate. Strawson\u2019s account, rather than Austin\u2019s, became\nthe focus of debate. Strawson himself returned to the former question\nin later articles, arguing persuasively that even on the most\ncharitable interpretation Austin\u2019s idea of two sorts of\nconventions cannot be made sense of. Strawson himself favoured a view\nwhich took as the central insight about truth (one deriving from F. P.\nRamsey) that to say that P is true is equivalent to saying that P.\nStrawson\u2019s own main contribution to working out this idea was to\nstress the linguistic acts that the word \u2018true\u2019 enables us\nto perform. This left him free to point out that even if\nRamsey\u2019s equivalence is the fundamental core of the notion of\ntruth, it would not follow that the expression \u2018true\u2019 is a\nredundant expression. The presence in our language of the term\n\u2018true\u2019 might be of great\u2014indeed,\nindispensable\u2014utility.\n\nG. J. Warnock (in Warnock 1964) thought he discerned a problem in\nStrawson\u2019s account because the theory might not allow that in\nsaying that a certain remark is true a speaker is saying something\nabout that remark, which Warnock thought a desirable element in an\naccount of truth. Rather, Warnock felt that according to Strawson the\nspeaker is simply saying the same as the original remark. In his\nresponse Strawson pointed out that it is possible to incorporate\nreference to the statement in the analysis he gave of truth\nascriptions. Thus, the claim \u2018John\u2019s statement that\nP is true\u2019 can be treated as equivalent to (say)\n\u2018P, as John\u2019s statement said\u2019. This is\ningenious, but it leaves one aspect of Strawson\u2019s view\nunexplained, and it may have been this aspect that Warnock was trying\nto home in on. Strawson stressed that it is statements that are truth\nbearers. If, however, truth should not be thought of as a property of\nanything, then what is the point of carefully identifying the things\nthat are its bearers? (On some of these issues, see Searle 1998.)\n",
