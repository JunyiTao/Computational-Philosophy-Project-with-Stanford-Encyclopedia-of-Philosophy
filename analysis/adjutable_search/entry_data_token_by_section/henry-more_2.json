    "main_text": "The Spirit of Nature\n3. The Spirit of Nature\n\nWe have already seen that More admired the philosophy of Descartes\nprecisely because he felt that it showed that matter alone cannot\nexplain all phenomena. He reiterated this in the Immortality,\nrecommending that the French philosophy should be taught in all the\nuniversities of Europe,\n\nThat the Students of Philosophy may be thoroughly exercised in the\njust extent of the Mechanical Powers of Matter, how farre they will\nreach, and where they fall short. Which will be the best assistance to\nReligion that Reason and the Knowledge of Nature can afford (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 13).\n\n\nThe perceived short-fall would be helpful to religion, according to\nMore, precisely because the deficit could only be made good by\nacknowledging the role of an immaterial, active principle. This\nprinciple was the Spirit of Nature.\n\nIn the Immortality of the Soul (1659) More accepts the\nfundamental precepts of the mechanical philosophy, and acknowledges\nthe Cartesian claim that \u201cMatter it self once moved can move\nother Matter\u201d (More 1662, in Immortality of the Soul,\nseparately paginated, 21), but insists that it cannot move itself. So\nfar, Descartes would agree. Unlike Descartes, however, More refuses to\naccept that all the phenomena of the universe can follow from an\noriginal push by God, setting in train an endless cosmic chain\nreaction of colliding particles. Even though Descartes talks of the\ncontinued action of God in preserving the same quantity of motion in\nthe world, as far as More is concerned the Cartesian account concedes\ntoo much to the mechanical interactions of material entities. Although\nboth More and Descartes agree that God, the primary cause of all\nthings, operates in the world by means of delegated secondary causes,\nthey differ radically about the correct secondary causes. For\nDescartes, bodies in motion, acting in conformity with his laws of\nnature and rules of collision, are the secondary causes; but More\ncannot accept that bodies can perform all that is required. More\nrecognises that Descartes\u2019s view could undermine his own prior\ncommitment to his dualistic theology, because it could be made to lead\nto a monistic materialist system of mechanical philosophy (in which\nGod\u2019s role is simply written out). In an attempt to avoid this,\nMore says that the fact that matter can be brought to rest \u201cis\nan Argument not only that Self activity belongs to a Spirit, but that\nthere is such a thing as Spirit in the world\u201d. Presumably the\npoint is that if matter was self-active it could not stop its own\nactivity, and therefore could never come to rest. Anyone who denies\nthis, More insists, \u201cmust of necessity (as I have intimated\nalready) confess that this Matter moves it self, though it be very\nincongruous so to affirm\u201d (More 1662, Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 31).\n\nAccordingly, More concludes that there must be an active principle at\nwork to take care of those things which cannot be accomplished by the\n\u201cMechanical Powers of Matter\u201d:\n\nI ask\u2026 if there be not in nature an incorporeal substance\nwhich, while it can impress on any body all the qualities of body, or\nat least most of them, such as motion, figure, position of parts,\netc\u2026 would be further able, since it is almost certain that\nthis substance removes and stops bodies, to add whatever is involved\nin such motion, that is it can unite, divide, scatter, bind, form the\nsmall parts, order the forms, set in circular motion those which are\ndisposed for it, or move them in any way whatever, arrest their\ncircular motion and do such similar things with them as are necessary\nto produce\u2026 light, colours and the other objects of the\nsenses\u2026 (More, letter to Descartes, 5 March 1649, in More 1662,\nEpistolae quatuor ad Renatum Des-Cartes, separately\npaginated, 79\u201380).\n\n\nBut how is it that this incorporeal substance can \u201cactuate grand\nproportions of matter\u201d? Here More draws on Neoplatonic\nemanationism. The Spirit of Nature, he says, actuates matter as it\nemanates outward in a \u201csphere of life and activity\u201d (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 27). It\ndoes so because it is axiomatic that an \u201cEmanative Cause\u201d\nis \u201csuch a cause as merely by Being, no other activity or\ncausality interposed, produces an Effect.\u201d An example of an\nemanative cause is light from a candle. When a candle is lit it emits\nlight and cannot fail to do so. There must be such a cause in the\nworld, he says, because \u201csomething must move itself\u201d (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 27).\n\nIt should be noted that More\u2019s Spirit of Nature must be extended\nin space, if it can be said to emanate spherically. This marks\nMore\u2019s notion of spirit out from Descartes\u2019s res\ncogitans. For Descartes, matter is extended and souls are not;\nstrictly speaking (although there was some room for manoeuvre, Reid\n2008), souls are non-spatial entities and do not exist in space. For\nMore, this is an idea of existence which makes no sense. For something\nto exist, it must exist somewhere; it must occupy space. The same is\ntrue of God, no less than the Spirit of Nature, and individual souls\n(Reid 2003, Leech 2013).\n\nMore has a ready answer to those for whom extension implies\ndivisibility, and who therefore object that, if More were right, God\nand souls would be divisible. More concedes that extended things can\nbe divided conceptually, but immaterial spirits, such as God and\nsouls, cannot be physically divided in any way. Moving away from the\nconcept of divisibility, More introduces the notion of what he calls\n\u201cdiscerpibility\u201d, deriving from the Latin word for tearing\nin pieces. He draws on the long-standing exemplar of Neoplatonic\nemanation theory to make his point\u2014light. A luminous orb of\nlight, he says, \u201cdoes very much resemble the nature of a Spirit,\nwhich is diffus\u2019d and extended, and yet indivisible\u201d (More\n1662, Antidote Against Atheism, separately paginated, 150).\nNo engine or art could separate one luminous ray from another, and\n\nThe parts of a Spirit can be no more separated, though they be\ndilated, than you can cut off the Rayes of the Sun by a pair of\nScissors made of pellucid Crystall (More 1662, Antidote Against\nAtheism, separately paginated, 16).\n Accordingly, it is not possible to separate any part of\nan extended soul from the rest, or to tear off a piece of God.\n\n\nIn Ancient emanation theory, of course, the ultimate source from which\nall things emanated was God, and it seems clear that More follows suit\nhere as well. The Spirit of Nature is \u201cthe first step to the\nabstrusest mysteries in Natural Theologie\u201d, More writes, because\nit is \u201cthe Vicarious Power of God upon the Matter\u201d (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 13). But\nthis seems to open More up to another charge, namely that he has\nabandoned any pretence to a natural philosophy, seeking to explain\nphenomena in terms of secondary causation, and instead simply defers\nall things to the direct action of God.\n\nBut More is adamant that the Spirit of Nature is a \u201cSecondary or\nEmanatory Substance\u201d (More 1662, Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 28), and should correctly be seen as\na secondary cause. Responding to the charge that he has\n\u201cintroduced an obscure Principle for ignorance and Sloth to take\nsanctuary in\u2026 and hinder that expected progress that may be\nmade in the Mechanick Philosophy\u201d (More 1662, Immortality of\nthe Soul, separately paginated, 11), More insisted that the\nSpirit of Nature was a help, not a hindrance. Speaking of this\ninstrument of the \u201cVicarious Power of God\u201d, he wrote:\n\nNor needs the acknowledgment of this Principle to damp our endeavours\nin the search of the Mechanical causes of the Phaenomena of Nature,\nbut rather make us more circumspect to distinguish what is the result\nof the more mechanical powers of Matter and Motion, and what of an\nHigher Principle (More 1662, Immortality of the Soul,\nseparately paginated, 12\u201313).\n\n\nOne of the ways in which More supported this claim was to repeatedly\ninsist that the Spirit of Nature operated blindly, without perception\nor intelligence (and so was not in any sense the manifestation of the\ndirect action of God). He illustrates this by reference to the new\nexperiments with an air-pump conducted by Robert Boyle. If the\nair-pump is fitted with a valve, the air beating against the valve\nwill not only close the valve against itself, but \u201cwill bear up\nwith it a ten-pound weight\u201d (More 1662, Antidote Against\nAtheism, separately paginated, 44). This kind of\n\u201cself-thwarting\u201d activity (since the air really\n\u201cintends\u201d to fill up the vacuum in the chamber of the\npump) shows not only that the air has \u201cno Power, Knowledge, and\nliberty of will\u201d, but also that there are no \u201cDivine\nparticles interspersed in the Aire that have\u201d. More concludes at\nthis point,\n\nthat the Impetus of Motion in all matter is blinde and necessary, and\nthat there is no Matter at all that is free and knowing but moves and\nacts of it self\u2026 according to the mere Mechanical laws of\nMotion (More 1662, Antidote, separately paginated, 44).\n\n\nElsewhere More says,\n\nThat no matter whatsoever of its own Nature has any active Principle\nof Motion, though it be receptive thereof; but that when God created\nit, he superadded an impress of Motion upon it, such a measure and\nproportion to all of it, which remains still much-what the same for\nquantity in the whole, though the parts of Matter in their various\noccursion of one to another have not always the same proportion of\nit\u2026 (More 1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately\npaginated, 47\u20138).\n\n\nHere, then, More fully accepts the precepts of the mechanical\nphilosophy, but he refuses to accept that Cartesianism can account for\nall phenomena. As in his letters to Descartes, for example, he points\nout that the mechanical vortex theory should result in cylindrical\nheavenly bodies, so it must be the action of the Spirit of Nature that\nmakes them spherical (see, for example, More 1662, in Antidote\nAgainst Atheism, separately paginated, 39; see also the Preface\nGeneral, xv). He also points to magnetism and gravity as phenomena\nwhich are not convincingly explained by Descartes, as well as\ncondensation and rarefaction. He also points to the Achilles heel of\nthe mechanical philosophy, the generation and development of plants\nand animals, as well as the instinctive behaviour of animals. Later on\nin his career, however, More\u2019s concern to establish the\nexistence of immaterial spirit beyond all doubt, leads him to deny\nthat bodies are capable even of mechanical interactions: \u201cthere\nis no Phaenomenon of Nature purely Mechanicall\u201d (More 1668, 31).\nAll phenomena, he says, are \u201cnot carried according to\nMechanicall Necessity, but that there is a Principle that has a\nProspection for the best, that rules all\u201d (More 1686, 34).\n\nIn all these cases the Spirit of Nature is required to intervene,\nalthough More is vague upon precisely how it intervenes. Later on More\ndevelops the idea that the Spirit of Nature can \u201cunite and as it\nwere cohere\u201d (uniatur & quasi cohaerescat) with\nbody in order to move it (More 1671, 398; translated in More 1682,\n174). In the Immortality of the soul, however, he seems to\nimply that it simply communicates the laws of nature to the relevant\nsystems, since he describes it as \u201ca mute copy of the eternal\nWord (that is, of that Divine Wisedome that is entirely\neverywhere)\u201d which\n\nis in every part naturally appointed to do all the best services that\nMatter is capable of\u2026 according to that Platform of which it is\nthe Transcript, I mean according to the comprehension and Purpose of\nthose Idea\u2019s [sic] of things which are in the eternal\nIntellect of God.\n\n\nAccordingly, the Spirit of Nature \u201cis the lowest Substantial\nActivity from the all-wise God, containing in it certain general Modes\nand Lawes of Nature\u201d (More 1662, Preface General, xvi).\nSimilarly, in his defence of the concept of the Spirit of Nature\nagainst the criticisms of Sir Mathew Hale, More declares:\n\nit is manifest that there is a more noble and divine Being in the\nworld that gave this inferiour immaterial Being its existence and\nallotted to it in measure, or limited out to it these general Laws of\nvital activity, which we discover in it in the Phaenomena of Nature\n(More 1676, 190).\n\n\nBut More is less concerned about the details of how the Spirit of\nNature fulfils its functions, than he is with establishing that it\nmust exist. As he goes on to say immediately after the last\nquotation:\n\nthis certainty of the existence of the Spirit of Nature demolisheth\nthe strongest bulwark that ordinarily the Atheist has, namely his\nconfidence that there is no such thing as a Spirit or Immaterial Being\nin the World. Whence he securely hugs himself in that fond and foul\nConclusion, That there is no God (More 1676, 190).\n\n\nHaving pointed to phenomena in nature which cannot be explained in\nterms of the mechanical philosophy, More can introduce the concept of\nan active Spirit of Nature to fill in the lacunae. He therefore has\nprovided, according to his own lights, a rational, philosophical,\nbasis for the necessary existence of the Spirit of Nature, and by\nextension of spirit, or incorporeal substance more generally. This is\ncrucial, of course, for More\u2019s dualistic theology. It seems\nclear to us, as it must have for many contemporary readers, that the\nSpirit of Nature did not emerge from More\u2019s understanding of the\nnatural world, but from the demands of his rational dualist ontology.\nPreoccupied as he was with the need to establish a categorical dualism\nbetween inert matter and active incorporeal spirit, he was quick to\nsee those parts of Descartes\u2019s natural philosophy which were\nleast plausible, or completely unconvincing, as providing what he took\nto be evidence for the necessary existence of the Spirit of\nNature.\n",
