    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nRoyce was born November 20, 1855, in the remote mining town of Grass\nValley, California, to Josiah and Sarah Eleanor Bayliss Royce. Sarah\nRoyce was a devout Christian who headed a primary school in Grass\nValley. Royce\u2019s mother and older sisters directed his early\neducation. At age 11 he entered school in San Francisco. He graduated\nfrom the newly established University of California in Oakland with a\nB. A. degree in Classics in 1875. Royce then traveled to Germany to\nstudy philosophy for one year, mastering the language and attending\nlectures in Heidelberg, Leipzig, and G\u00f6ttingen. On his return, he\nentered the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he\nearned a Ph. D. in 1878.\n\nHe taught composition and literature at the University of California,\nBerkeley from 1878\u20131882. During this time he published numerous\nphilosophical articles, as well as his Primer of Logical\nAnalysis. He married Katherine Head in 1880. The couple had three\nchildren (Christopher 1882; Edward 1886; Stephen 1889) and remained\nmarried until Josiah\u2019s death. Not content in California, so far\nfrom the intellectual life of the East Coast, Royce sought help in\nattaining a new post from his acquaintances there. In his later\nethical writings Royce would stress the centrality of action intended\nto realize a sound ideal that one has freely embraced. When offered\nthe opportunity to replace William James during a one year sabbatical\nat Harvard University, Royce acted: he accepted the offer of half of\nJames\u2019s salary, resigned his California appointment altogether,\nand moved his wife and newborn son across the continent in the summer\nof 1882.\n\nIn Cambridge, Royce commenced to work doggedly and in diverse areas.\nIn January 1883 he arrived at an insight that proved fundamental to\nhis philosophy: in order for our ordinary concepts of truth and error\nto be meaningful, there must be an Absolute Knower, an actual infinite\nmind that encompasses the totality of all actual truths and possible\nerrors. This insight formed the core of his first major philosophical\npublication, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy, which\nappeared in 1885. Royce received a permanent appointment as assistant\nprofessor at Harvard in that same year. (During his three decades at\nHarvard Royce would teach such notable students as T. S. Eliot, George\nSantayana, and W. E. B. Du Bois.) He taught full time, gave many\npublic lectures, published his History of California in 1886,\nand a novel in 1887. In 1888 he experienced a nervous breakdown, from\nwhich he recovered after a sea voyage of some months\u2019\nduration.\n\nRoyce was appointed Professor of the History of Philosophy at Harvard\nin 1892 and served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy from\n1894\u201398. During these years Royce established himself as a\nleading figure in American academic philosophy with his many reviews,\nlectures and books, including The Spirit of Modern Philosophy\n(1892) and The Conception of God (1895). In 1898 Royce\nattended a series of lectures by Charles S. Peirce, \u201cReasoning\nand the Logic of Things,\u201d which significantly influenced his\nunderstanding of the relation between logic and metaphysics.\n\nRoyce delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of\nAberdeen in two series, the first in 1899 and the second the following\nyear. He regarded this as the opportunity to consolidate his years of\nhard thought and study, so as to produce a definitive and original\nstatement of his metaphysics. The result was his two volume opus\nThe World and the Individual (1899\u20131901).\n\nThe Gifford Lectures marked a turning point in Royce\u2019s life and\nthought. He had worked out his philosophical theories in minute\ndetail. His public reputation as a philosopher was sealed (Royce was\nelected president of the American Psychological Association in 1902\nand of the American Philosophical Association in 1903). The year 1900\napparently represented the culmination of his life\u2019s work. Royce\nwas only 45 years old, though, and this culmination proved also to be\na starting point for significant growth.\n\nReviews of The World and the Individual praised Royce\u2019s\nphilosophical acumen but raised significant objections to his\nconclusions. Peirce, in particular, pointedly criticized Royce\u2019s\nuse of logic. Royce set out to reconsider his central arguments and,\nat the same time, undertook an ambitious program of study in\nmathematical logic. In his teaching and publications after 1900, two\nphilosophical strains came to the forefront. One was a growing\nreliance on formal logical and mathematical concepts as the basis for\nhis metaphysical speculation (the first hint of this appears in the\n\u201cSupplementary Essay\u201d to the first volume of The World\nand the Individual). The second was an emphasis on philosophy as\na means to understand the concrete phenomena of life: the nature of\nhuman society, of religious experience, of ethical action, of\nsuffering and the problem of evil.\n\nAfter 1907 Royce\u2019s emphasis on the relevance of philosophy for\nliving took on a clear personal dimension. In that year Christopher,\nwho had come with Josiah and Katherine across the continent as a\nnewborn 25 years earlier, and who had graduated from Harvard at age\n18, showed symptoms of severe depression and psychotic delusions. In\n1908 his parents committed him to a state mental hospital with little\nhope that he would recover. In August of 1910 William James died,\nleaving Royce without his closest friend, neighbor and colleague. In\nSeptember of the same year Christopher Royce died of typhoid fever,\nleaving Josiah and Katherine without their firstborn child. Royce had\nearlier stated his philosophy in a somewhat abstract and formal way,\nso that it might help him discover metaphysical truth. Perhaps under\nthe weight of these later sorrows, Royce returned to his system\nseeking wisdom and understanding in addition to truth.\n\nAlthough he by no means abandoned systematic and theoretical\nphilosophy, Royce began to write more about what today would be called\n\u201cpractical\u201d or \u201capplied\u201d philosophy. His major\nwork on ethics, The Philosophy of Loyalty, appeared in 1908.\nLater he would address ethics in even more practical terms, not as a\nphilosophy but as an \u201cart\u201d of loyalty. He published a\ncollection of essays under the title Race Questions,\nProvincialism, and Other American Problems in 1908; another\ncollection, entitled William James and Other Essays on the\nPhilosophy of Life, appeared in 1911. Four of the six essays in\nThe Hope of the Great Community, written in the last year of\nhis life and published posthumously in 1916, directly concerned global\npolitics and the Great War.\n\nRoyce and James had always disagreed deeply concerning the proper\nunderstanding of religious phenomena in human life. When James\ndelivered the Gifford Lectures in 1901 and 1902, he directed many\narguments against Royce\u2019s idealism, though he did not there\ntarget his friend by name. James\u2019s lectures, published as\nThe Varieties of Religious Experience, were a popular and\nacademic success. Royce believed that James, who had never been\nregularly affiliated with an established church or religious\ncommunity, had in that work placed too much emphasis on the\nextraordinary religious experiences of extraordinary individuals.\nRoyce\u2019s first education was into a strongly Protestant world\nview, he always retained a respect for the conventions of organized\nChristianity, and his writings exhibit a consistent and deep\nfamiliarity with Scripture. He sought a philosophy of religion that\ncould help one understand and explain the phenomena of ordinary\nreligious faith as experienced by communities of ordinary people.\nThere was a deeper difference between them, as well, and it centered\non a metaphysical point. Royce\u2019s 1883 insight concerning the\nAbsolute was at bottom a religious insight. Contrary to the open-ended\npluralism and pragmatism of James, Royce was convinced that the object\nand source of religious experience was an actual, infinite, and\nsuperhuman being. Royce did not attempt to work out his religious\nphilosophy until after James\u2019s death, however. In 1911 Royce\nfinally composed the lectures that responded to James. These were\npublished in 1912 as The Sources of Religious Insight. It is\nhere that the theoretical and practical threads of his late thought\nbegan to come together. Royce himself said of the Sources:\n\u201cIt contains the whole of me in a brief compass\u201d\n(Clendenning 1970, 570).\n\nIn early 1912, Royce suffered a stroke. During his recovery, he\ncontinued to explore the philosophy of religion outlined in the\nSources, with an eye toward adapting these ideas specifically\nto Christianity. He also returned to Peirce\u2019s writings, seeking\nthe solution to certain nagging problems in his own metaphysics. He\nfound in Peirce\u2019s semeiotic, or theory of signs, the technical\ntools he needed to address both issues at once. The Problem of\nChristianity presents, in place of the earlier Absolute Knower,\nthe concept of an infinite community of interpretation guided by a\nshared spirit of truth-seeking. This Universal Community, which\nconstitutes reality, develops greater understanding over time through\nits members\u2019 continual development of the meaning of signs.\nWithin this framework Royce endeavored to reconcile and explain many\nkey Christian doctrines and experiences.\n\nThough Royce lived only a few years beyond this late philosophical\nbreakthrough, his last period brought the true culmination and\nflowering of his life\u2019s work. Besides The Sources of\nReligious Insight and The Problem of Christianity,\nnotable available works include The Hope of the Great\nCommunity, his last Harvard seminar on Metaphysics\n(1915\u201316) and a series of lectures given at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley. These lectures at his alma mater were to have\nended with a talk entitled \u201cThe Spirit of the Community.\u201d\nWhen the Great War broke out, Royce set this manuscript aside and\nsketched a practical proposal to use the economic power of insurance\nto mediate hostilities among nations and hence reduce the attraction\nof war in the future. War and Insurance (1914) was a daring\npolitical and economic proposal on behalf of the Universal\nCommunity.\n\nRoyce died on September 14, 1916. Though scholars now recognize the\noriginality and strength of his last works, he was unable to respond\nto critics or to press his case for the last crucial innovations to\nhis philosophy. His reputation was eclipsed as other philosophers used\nRoyce\u2019s earlier writings as a foil in developing their own\ndoctrines of pragmatism, realism, empiricism, and logical analysis.\nWhile scholars of American intellectual life have always acknowledged\nthe historical importance of Royce\u2019s influence, recent years\nhave brought a revival of interest in Royce\u2019s thought on its own\nterms. Royce\u2019s work is proving especially fruitful for\ntheologians and philosophers interested in speculative philosophy and\nmetaphysics, practical and theoretical ethics, philosophy of religion,\nand the philosophy of community.\n",
