Similarly, ethical hedonists agree with one\nanother that the good is pleasure, but there is some disagreement among\nthem, and among non-hedonists too, about what pleasure is. Accounts of\npleasure are canvassed below, and issues with them are briefly\nreviewed, especially regarding the various ways in which they bear on\nthe prospects for ethical hedonism.\n\n\nPhenomenalism about pleasure is the thesis that pleasure is a mental\nstate or property that is or that has a certain something that is\n\u2018what it is like\u2019 for its subject; a certain feel, feeling,\nfelt character, tone or phenomenology. On the face of it, the classic\nutilitarians Jeremy Bentham and J.S. Mill were phenomenalists about\npleasure. With various complexities and qualifications, so too are some\nmore recent writers (e.g., Moore: 64, Broad: 229\u201333, Schlick: ch. 2,\nSprigge: ch. 5, T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6: 84\u201384, Crisp 2006: 103\u2013109, Bradley,\nLabukt).\n\n\nIntentionalism about pleasure is the thesis that pleasure is an\nintentional state or property and thus has \u2018directedness\u2019.\nIntentional or representational states or properties are many and\ndiverse, but they share a subject-mode-content structure (Crane: ch.\n1). You or I or the next person might be the subject, belief or\nintention or desire or perception or emotion or pleasure might be the\nintentional mode, and the content of this intentional state or property\nincludes its object or that which it is about. If I delight in the day,\nfor example, I am the subject of this mental state or property that has\ndelight as its intentional mode and the day as its intentional object.\nMy delight in the day is thus an instance of intentional pleasure.\nIntentionalism implies that pleasure is an intentional state or a\nproperty in the pleasure mode that has some object. Brentano\n(1874/1973) was an intentionalist about pleasure, and so too are some\nmore recent philosophers (e.g., Chisholm, Crane, Feldman 2004).\n\n\nIntentionalist accounts of pleasure are less well known than\nphenomenalist accounts, so they merit brief elaboration on several\npoints. First, to say that pleasure is an intentional state or property\nis not to make any claim about deliberateness, choice or intention.\nIntentionalism is the thesis that pleasure has\n\u2018about-ness\u2019, it not a thesis about pleasure's\nrelation to the will. Second, if pleasure is an intentional state or\nproperty then it has an object, but it does not follow that all\npleasures are propositional attitudes, with states of affairs or\npropositions as their objects. On one standard account, any\npsychological verb that can be inserted into the \u03c6 place in the\nschema \u2018S \u03c6s that p\u2019 is an attitude (e.g.,\n\u2018thinks\u2019, \u2018hopes\u2019, \u2018wishes\u2019,\n\u2018prefers\u2019, \u2018delights\u2019, \u2018enjoys\u2019) to\na proposition p. Some accept the universal thesis that all intentional\nstates are propositional attitudes. But this thesis is vulnerable to\ncounterexample from object-directed emotions including personal love\nand hate, the objects of which seem not to be fully specifiable as\nstates of affairs or as propositions. Relatedly, though some\nintentional pleasures are indeed propositional attitudes, it is a\nsignificant further question whether they all are. A third\nclarification is this. If there are intentional pleasures then they are\nsuch that their objects might or might not exist. I could delight in\nthe concert performance of my favourite musician, for example, even if\nthe actual performer is instead just a talented imposter, or even if\nthe \u2018performer\u2019 is in fact just an audio-visual effect of\nclever sound and light projection. Or, to update and to make concrete\nan older and more abstract example from Chisholm (28\u201329), Gore might\nfor a time have enjoyed his victory in the 2000 U.S. presidential\nelection, even though he actually did not win it. These claims about\nintentional pleasures are instances of the wider and admittedly rather\nperplexing point that the objects of some intentional states and\nproperties do not exist (see entry on\n Intentionality).\n\n\nIn various significant ways, issues concerning the phenomenal and\nintentional nature of pleasure bear on hedonism about value. Such\nmatters are canvassed below.\n\n\nIntentionalism about the mental is the thesis that all mental\nmatters are intentional, that they all have directedness or\n\u2018aboutness\u2019 (e.g., Brentano 1874/1973, Crane). Pleasure is a\nmental matter, so intentionalism about pleasure implies that any\npleasure is an intentional matter and thus has an object. Strong\nintentionalism implies that phenomenal character is purely a matter of\nintentional character, and this implies in turn that intentional\ncharacter exhausts phenomenal character. All intentionalist accounts of\npleasure are of course consistent with intentionalism about pleasure.\nBut intentionalism about pleasure is inconsistent with any radical\nphenomenalist account that claims, of some or all pleasure, that it has\nno intentional character. Moderate phenomenalist accounts instead claim\nthat all pleasure is both phenomenal and intentional; so they are\nconsistent with intentionalism, and some are also consistent with\nstrong intentionalism. Some phenomenalist accounts of pleasure are\nneither radical nor moderate; but are instead indeterminate on the\nmatter of whether or not pleasure has any intentional character. Such\nindeterminacy then carries through to any form of hedonism that is\nbuilt on them. Insofar as such indeterminacy is undesirable in any\naccount of pleasure, and in any hedonist thesis, it is a count against\nthese views.\n\n\nPhenomenalism about pleasure is the thesis that all pleasure has\nphenomenal character. Radical intentionalist accounts (e.g., Feldman\n2004: 56, Shafer-Landau: 20) claim, of some or all pleasure, that it\nhas no phenomenal or felt character. Any such account is inconsistent\nwith phenomenalism about pleasure. Though Feldman and Shafer-Landau do\nargue that intentional pleasure need not have any phenomenology or felt\ncharacter, they also argue, respectively, that there is a distinct\n\u2018sensory\u2019 or \u2018physical\u2019 sort of pleasure that\ndoes have felt character. Moderate intentionalist accounts, by\ncontrast, claim that all pleasure is both phenomenal and intentional,\nand this makes them consistent with phenomenalism about pleasure. Most\nintentionalists are mindful that all pleasure has a phenomenal\nreputation, and they attempt to account for this.\n\n\nModerate phenomenalism and moderate intentionalism can be re-framed\nas hybrid accounts that build on the idea that pleasure has both\nphenomenal and intentional character. A strong intentionalist hybrid\nview (e.g., Crane: chs. 1, 3) is that pleasure is a property or state\nthe phenomenal character of which is fully captured in its intentional\ncharacter. On one account of this sort, the phenomenal property or\nstate of my delighting in the day just is my having a state or property\nin the intentional mode of delight, with content that includes\ndirectedness at the day. A different hybrid account is that pleasure is\nan intentional state or property that also has a phenomenal\nhigher-order property. Along these lines, it might be held that delight\nin the day is a state or property in the delight mode that is directed\nat the day, and that in addition has a certain felt character. A third\nhybrid account is that pleasure is an intentional state or property\nthat has a phenomenal object. Along these lines, my delighting in the\nday might be taken to be my intrinsically desiring a certain day-caused\nphenomenal delight-state or delight-property of mine. A fourth hybrid\naccount is that pleasure is a phenomenal state or property that in\naddition meets an object-of-intentional-state condition. For example,\none might regard: \u201cPleasure\u2026 as a feeling which \u2026\nis at least implicitly apprehended as desirable\u2026\u201d\n(Sidgwick: 127; see also Brandt, Sumner: 90). This fourth sort of\nhybrid view is rather demanding, because any subject who lacks the\ncapacity \u2018implicitly to apprehend as desirable\u2019 is\nincapable of such pleasure.\n\n\nRyle (1954) argued that all sensations have felt location. For\nexample, one feels the pain of toe-stubbing to be located in\none's toe. Ryle also argued that pleasure has no felt location,\nand he concluded that it cannot be a sensation. Phenomenalists about\npleasure need not contest any of this. They need not think pleasure is\na sensory or a sensation state or property, and if they allow that\nbodily phenomenal pain does have intentional character, they can\naccount for the felt location of one's pain of toe-stubbing in\nterms of its being directed at one's toe. Much the same is true\nof intentionalists. They can claim that pleasure is an intentional\nstate or property, without claiming that its intentional character\ninvolves its having any felt location. For example, my delight in the\nday is about the day, not about any bodily location of mine. Moderate\nphenomenalism and moderate intentionalism are thus consistent with Ryle\non these points. Ryle's arguments do nevertheless present\nchallenges for some pleasure-pain symmetry theses.\n\n\nIt is plausible that at least some pleasures have directedness.\nThese pleasures present challenges for radical phenomenalists who deny\nthat any pleasure has any intentional character. They need not trouble\nmore modest forms of phenomenalism that do allow also for intentional\ncharacter.\n\n\nOne option is to claim that some pleasures do not have any\nintentional character and are thus not directed at or about anything.\nFor example, it might be claimed that there is objectless euphoria and\necstasy, or that undirected feelings of anxiety or suffering exist.\nSuch cases would be no trouble for the sorts of phenomenalism that\nreject any form of intentionalism about pleasure. Intentionalists, by\ncontrast, must insist that every pleasure and displeasure has an\nobject. They might argue, for example, that allegedly objectless\neuphoria and ecstasy or anxiety in fact do have objects, even if these\nobjects are not fully determinate; perhaps, for example, they are\ndirected at things in general, or one's life in\ngeneral. Intentionalists might add that the indeterminacy of these\nobjects is part of the charm of \u2018objectless\u2019 euphoria and\necstasy, and of the awfulness of \u2018objectless\u2019 anxiety and\ndepression. In support of the broader idea that intentional states can\nhave vague or indeterminate objects, while ordinary or substantial\nobjects cannot, Elizabeth Anscombe offered this pugilist's\nexample: \u201cI can think of a man without thinking of a man of any\nparticular height; I cannot hit a man without hitting a man of any\nparticular height, because there is no such thing as a man of no\nparticular height\u201d (Anscombe: 161). A different response to the\nclaim that some pleasures and displeasures are objectless is to move to\na fundamentally pluralist view, according to which some pleasure and\ndispleasure is intentional, other pleasure and displeasure is\nphenomenal, and some of the latter has no intentional character at\nall.\n\n\nMonism about pleasure is the thesis that there is just one basic\nkind of mental state or property that is pleasure. Phenomenal monism\nholds that there is just one basic kind pleasure feeling or tone, while\nintentional monism claims there is just one basic kind of pleasure\nintentional state or property. The disunity objection to monism is\nbased on the claim that there is no unified or common element in all\ninstances of pleasure (e.g., Sidgwick: 127, Alston: 344, Brandt: 35\u201342,\nParfit: 493, Griffin: 8, Sprigge: ch. 5). With few exceptions if any,\nsuch objections have to date targeted phenomenal monism. But both the\nobjection and the possible replies to it are under-explored in the\ndifferent context of intentional monism. The standard phenomenal monist\nreply is to insist that there is just one basic kind of\npleasure and that this is a matter of there being a common element in\npleasure's feeling, felt tone, or phenomenology, or in\n\u2018what it is like\u2019 to have pleasure (e.g., Moore: 12\u201313,\nBroad: 229, Sumner: 87\u201391). Broad, for example, wrote that the common\nphenomenal character of pleasure is something \u201cwe cannot define\nbut are perfectly acquainted with\u201d (Broad: 229). Alternatively,\nif some definition is to be attempted, one thought is that the common\nphenomenal character of all pleasure is just its felt pleasantness. A\ndifferent claim is that there is a common feel-good character or felt\npositivity in all pleasure. This claim is not clear, but can be spelt\nout in at least the following three different ways: that there is such\na property as felt positivity and that all instances of pleasure have\nit; that all pleasure consists partly in feeling the existence of\ngoodness or value; or that all pleasure has goodness or value as an\nintentional object, and this is so whether or not goodness or value\nexists.\n\n\nPluralism in the present setting is the thesis that there is more\nthan one basic kind of state or property that is pleasure, that\npleasure is multiply or variously or diversely realizable, or that\nthere is a basic plurality of sufficient conditions for pleasure. The\ncore idea is that there is a basic plurality of kinds of feel or of\nintentional state, each of which is a kind of pleasure (e.g., Rachels,\nLabukt, perhaps Rawls: 557). The unity objection to any such pluralism\nis that all instances of pleasure must meet some unitary sufficient\ncondition, and that pluralism is inconsistent with this. The obvious\npluralist reply is to reject this demand for unitariness. One rationale\nfor this reply is that multiple or plural realization theses about many\nkinds of mental states are coherent, widely made and merit serious\nconsideration, so the unity objector is not justified in thus seeking\nto rule them out at the outset of inquiry into the nature of\npleasure.\n\n\nReflection on both the disunity objection to monism and the unity\nobjection to pluralism about pleasure suggests a further option. This\nis the thesis that there is some feature that is phenomenal or\nintentional or both and that is common to all instances of pleasure,\nand that in addition, some pleasures differ from others in at least one\nother respect that has phenomenal or intentional character or both. One\nmotivation for such views is to draw out and combine insights from both\nmonism and pluralism about the nature of pleasure.\n\n\nWhich features of pleasure are most closely related to its value?\nBentham claimed that there are at least six \u2018dimensions of value\nin a pleasure or a pain\u2019: intensity, duration, certainty or\nuncertainty, propinquity or remoteness, fecundity, and purity (Bentham:\nch. 4). On one account, fecundity is a matter of being instrumental in\nother pleasure or pain, purity is a matter of separating pleasure out\nfrom non-pleasure, propinquity and remoteness concern temporal and/or\nspatial nearness or farness, and the essentials of certainty and\nuncertainty are plain enough. Recalling that non-instrumental value is\nthe present point of focus, Bentham's account suggests the\nquantitative hedonist idea that the non-instrumental value of pleasure\nis a matter just of its quantitative features, and that these reduce\njust to its duration and its intensity.\n\n\nQuantitative hedonism is consistent with monist phenomenalism about\npleasure, with \u2018intensity\u2019 here understood as \u2018felt\nintensity\u2019. It is also consistent with pluralist phenomenalism\nabout pleasure, but only on the assumption that none of the\nplurality-making features of pleasure also adds non-instrumentally to\nits value. It is less straightforward to see how to combine\nquantitative hedonism with those forms of intentionalism that deny that\npleasure need have any phenomenal character. Such accounts would need\nto explain the intensity or strength of pleasure in intentional terms\nand without making any appeal to felt intensity.\n\n\nResponding especially to the charge that a Benthamite account is a\n\u2018doctrine worthy only of swine\u2019, J.S. Mill (ch. 2)\ndeveloped an alternative approach according to which there is\n\u2018higher\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 pleasure, and its value is\nirreducibly a matter of its quality as well as its quantity. Mill\nargued that of two sorts of pleasures, if there is one that at least a\nmajority of those who have experience of both prefer then it is the\nmore desirable. The standard criticism of this qualitative hedonism is\nthat pleasure's quality reduces either to its quantity, or to\nsome anti-hedonist claim about value. The best sort of reply for\nqualitative hedonists is to present an account that does not suffer\nfrom either such reduction or such collapse. Pluralism about the nature\nof pleasure seems to be necessary for this, together with the claim\nthat one or more of the plurality-constituting features of pleasure\ndoes also add non-instrumentally add to its value. Qualitative\nhedonists who are also phenomenalists about pleasure will seek to find\nthe sources of such value differences in phenomenal differences.\nQualitative hedonists who are also intentionalists about the nature of\npleasure will seek to find the sources of such value differences in\nirreducibly non-quantitative differences amongst pleasures in the\nintentional mode, in the intentional content, or in both of these\naspects of these mental states or properties. Feldman's\n\u2018Truth-Adjusted Intrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism\u2019 is a view\nof this sort, due to its claim that the amount of intrinsic value of a\nlife is a matter of the truth-adjusted amount of its intrinsic\nattitudinal pleasure (Feldman 2004: 112). The same is true of\nFeldman's \u2018Desert-Adjusted Intrinsic Attitudinal\nHedonism\u2019, according to which the amount of intrinsic value of a\nlife is a matter of the desert-adjusted amount of its intrinsic\nattitudinal pleasure (Feldman 2004: 121).\n\n\nOne significant objection to hedonism about value is based on claims\nabout the nature and existence of pleasure. It assumes hedonism about\nvalue, conjoins this with the eliminativist thesis that there is no\nsuch thing as pleasure, infers the nihilist thesis that nothing\nactually has value, rebounds by rejecting this value nihilism, and then\nconcludes by retaining eliminativism about pleasure while rejecting\nhedonism about value. The most radical forms of eliminativism about\npleasure are across-the-board theses: there is no such thing as\npleasure, or there is no such thing as pain (e.g., Dennett; criticized\nby Flanagan amongst others), or both. Objections of the above sort that\nare based on the most radical eliminativist thesis speak against all\nforms of hedonism. Objections based on eliminativism about only\nphenomenal pleasure, or about only intentional pleasure, or about only\nsensational pleasure (e.g., Ryle, perhaps Sidgwick: 127, perhaps\nAristotle 1175a22f) speak against only the correspondingly narrower\nforms of hedonism.\n\n\nWhy believe eliminativism about phenomenal or intentional pleasure?\nOne sort of argument for it moves from the premise that there is no\nphenomenally or intentionally distinctive character common to all\ninstances of, for example, new romantic love, slaking a powerful\nthirst, sexual orgasm, solving a hard intellectual problem, and\nfireside reminiscence amongst friends, to the conclusion that there is\nno such thing as phenomenal or intentional pleasure. This sort of\nargument relies on monism about pleasure, and monism about pleasure is\nargued above to be questionable. Why believe eliminativism about\nsensational pleasure? One sort of argument for it is that any such\npleasure must be a sensation, and any sensation must have felt\nlocation, but no pleasure has felt location, so no pleasure sensation\nexists. Perhaps the most promising sort of hedonist response is to\nargue against eliminativism about pleasure, or at least against\neliminativism about pleasure on some particular favoured account of its\nnature.\n\n\nThis section has discussed the nature of pleasure as it bears on\nethical hedonism. It has outlined phenomenalist accounts,\nintentionalist accounts and hybrid accounts of pleasure. It has\nexamined various critical issues for hedonism that are related to the\nnature of pleasure, especially: quantitative versus qualitative\nhedonism, disunity objections to monistic hedonism and unity objections\nto pluralistic hedonism, and arguments from eliminativism about\npleasure to the rejection of hedonism about value. One overall\nconclusion to draw from this sub-section is that there would be benefit\nin further philosophical examination of the multiple connections\nbetween ethical hedonism and the phenomenal and intentional character\nof pleasure and displeasure.\n",
