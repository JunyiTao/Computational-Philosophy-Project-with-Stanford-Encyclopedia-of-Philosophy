In particular, the\npioneering work on the semantics of recursive programs carried out in\nStanford in the early 1970s by a group of people gathering around\nZohar Manna, and including Jean Marie Cadiou, Robin Milner and Jean\nVuillemin, also interacting with Gilles Kahn.\n\nA related tradition was also quite influential on the background of\nthe full abstraction problem, namely the characterizations of\nsemantical notions like continuity and sequentiality inside syntactic\nmodels of the (untyped) \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus based on B\u00f6hm trees\n(Barendregt 1984), mainly due to L\u00e9vy and Berry (see Berry et\nal. 1985 and Curien 1992) for accounts of the search for fully\nabstract models of PCF along this line).\n\nThe basic papers on full abstraction for PCF are Milner 1977; Plotkin\n1977. They can be read together as giving a coherent picture of the\nsemantic analysis of this language. An independent approach to full\nabstraction came from the Russian logician Vladimir Sazonov who\ncharacterized definability in PCF in terms of a certain class of\nsequential computational strategies (Sazonov 1975, 1976). His work,\nhowever, had no direct influence on the bulk of research on the full\nabstraction problem, and only recently there have been attempts to\nrelate Sazonov\u2019s characterization to the game theoretic\napproaches (Sazonov 2007).\n\nAnother, completely different approach to full abstraction, exploits\nspecial kinds of logical relations in order to isolate\nquotients of the continuous model. The first use of logical relations\nin the context of the problem of full abstraction is Mulmuley 1987,\nbut the resulting construction of a fully abstract model is obtained\nby brute force and therefore is not what the full abstraction problem\nsearches for. Later, Sieber (1992) and O\u2019Hearn & Riecke\n(1995) have employed refinements of this technique to gain a better\ninsight into the structure of the fully abstract models,\ncharacterizing the definable elements of the standard continuous model\nby means of invariance under special logical relations cutting out the\nnon-sequential functions.\n\nDetailed accounts of the full abstraction problem for PCF can be found\nin Gunter 1992 (chaps 5,6), Streicher 2006, Ong 1995, Stoughton 1988\nand Amadio & Curien 1998 (chaps 6, 12, 14), in approximately\nincreasing order of technical complexity. The emphasis on the\nrecursion-theoretic aspects of PCF and its full abstraction problem\nare dealt with in detail in the textbook (Longley & Normann 2015:\nchaps 6, 7); a shorter account can be found in Longley 2001 (sec.\n4).\n",
