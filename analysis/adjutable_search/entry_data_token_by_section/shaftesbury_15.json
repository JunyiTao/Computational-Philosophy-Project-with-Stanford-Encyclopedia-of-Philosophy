    "main_text": "Religion || Anti-voluntarism\n7.1 Anti-voluntarism\n\nCentral to Shaftesbury\u2019s religious views is a rejection of the\nvoluntarist claim that morality is determined by divine will. If\nGod\u2019s will determined morality, Shaftesbury argues, it would be\nmeaningless to praise God for being moral.\n\n\nFor whoever thinks there is a God, and\npretends formally to believe that he is just and\ngood, must suppose that there is independently such a thing\nas Justice and Injustice, Truth and\nFalshood, Right and Wrong; according to\nwhich he pronounces that God is just, righteous, and\ntrue. (C 2.49\u201350)\n\n\nAnyone who believes it is meaningful to love God because of\nGod\u2019s virtue must believe that morality is prior to God\u2019s\nwill.\n\nAgainst the voluntarists, Shaftesbury maintains that God\u2019s will\nis determined by morality. As Theocles (of The Moralists)\nsays of the position advanced by the author of the\nInquiry,\n\n\n[I]n respect of Virtue, what you lately\ncall\u2019d a Realist; he endeavours to shew, \u201cThat it\nis really something in it-self, and in the nature of Things:\nnot arbitrary or factitious, (if I may so speak) not\nconstituted from without, or dependent on Custom,\nFancy, or Will; not even on the Supreme\nWill it-self, which can no-way govern it: but being\nnecessarily good, is govern\u2019d by it, and ever uniform\nwith it\u201d. (C 2.267)\n\n\nThere are certain things we know to be necessarily true, such as that\na contradiction cannot hold and that it must be wrong to punish one\nperson for a different person\u2019s wrongdoing. But voluntarism has\nthe contrary\u2014and thus absurd\u2014implications.\n\n\nIf the mere Will, Decree, or Law of God be\nsaid absolutely to constitute Right and Wrong, then\nare these latter words of no significancy at all. For thus if each\npart of a Contradiction were affirm\u2019d for Truth by the supreme\nPower, they wou\u2019d consequently become true. Thus if one\nPerson were decreed to suffer for another\u2019s fault, the Sentence\nwou\u2019d be just and equitable. And thus, in the\nsame manner, if arbitrarily, and without reason, some Beings were\ndestin\u2019d to endure perpetual Ill, and others as constantly to\nenjoy Good; this also wou\u2019d pass under the same Denomination.\nBut to say of any thing that it is just or unjust,\non such a foundation as this, is to say nothing, or to speak without a\nmeaning (C 2.50)\n\n\nEvident here is Shaftesbury\u2019s belief that our certainty about\nsome things (including our certainty that the conduct supralapsarian\nCalvinists attribute to God is wrong) is sufficient basis for the\nrejection of all theologies that place God\u2019s will prior to\nmorality. In passages such as this, Shaftesbury manifests a profound\naffinity with the Cambridge Platonists (see Cassirer 1953:\n159\u2013202; Rivers 2000a: 88; Gill 2006: 12\u201329 and\n77\u201382).\n\nAs we have seen, Shaftesbury also argues that belief in voluntarism\nhas significantly deleterious moral effects. If you believe certain\nactions are wrong only because God arbitrarily commands you not to\nperform them, then your overwhelming reason for not performing those\nactions will be the self-interested desire to avoid God\u2019s\npunishment. But if that self-interested desire becomes your\noverwhelming motivation, it will crowd out and eventually destroy the\nother-loving motives that are essential to your own virtue and\nhappiness (C 2.55\u20136, 2.58\u20139; see also 1.97, 2.48\u201350,\n2.267).\n",
