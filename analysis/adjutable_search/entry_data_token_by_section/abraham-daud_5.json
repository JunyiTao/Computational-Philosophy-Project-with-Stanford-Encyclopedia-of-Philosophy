    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || Substance, Accident, and Natural Philosophy\n5.1 Substance, Accident, and Natural Philosophy\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s Aristotelian orientation is immediately evident in\nhis analysis of the notions of substance and accident, with which his\nbook opens. Everything that is, is either substance or accident.\nCriticizing the neo-Platonic approach of Solomon ibn Gabirol, who held\nthat substance and accident are relative terms, so that the selfsame\nthing can be a substance in one respect and an accident in another, he\ninsists that substance and accident are absolute terms and that a thing\nis either a substance or an accident, but not both. The fact that\ncertain substances derive their existence from a cause, and that they\ncan be ordered hierarchically, does not detract from their\nsubstantiality: ontologically all substances are alike. This initial\ninquiry into the ontological constitution of existing things and the\ncorrect understanding of \u201csubstance\u201d as that which\nconstitutes the essence of a thing (and is thus more worthy of the term\n\u201cbeing\u201d than is accident) is crucial to Ibn Daud. Besides\nforming the point of departure for a systematic discussion of various\nkinds of substances, corporeal and incorporeal, it allows him to prove\nthat the soul is a substance, not an accident. Moreover, the\ndistinction between corporeal and incorporeal substances introduces the\nreader to the existence of celestial intelligences; the incorporeal\nsimple substances that play a central role in his thought.\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s discussion of substance and accidents includes a\nsurvey of the Aristotelian categories, which is largely based on the\naccounts of the Muslim philosophers. After this initial exposition, the\ncategories are not given much further attention in the rest of the\nbook. For our purposes, however, it is important to note that this\noverview of the categories is the first systematic presentation of the\nsubject or, for that matter, of any other logical work by Aristotle, in\nJewish philosophy.\n\n\nThe introduction on substance and accident leads Ibn Daud to a\ndiscussion of the question of the sense in which form and matter, the\ntwo constituents of physical beings, are substances, which allows Ibn\nDaud to introduce the notions of potentiality and actuality. He then\nproceeds to deal with other basic principles of Aristotelian\nphilosophy, such as motion and infinity. I will not go into detail\nhere, since Ibn Daud\u2019s exposition does not actually provide any\nimportant new insights. Instead his aim is to introduce the beginning\nstudent to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics. However, it is worth\nnoting that, while earlier Jewish philosophers, such as Ibn Zaddiq,\nhad dealt with substance and accident and other such principles, Ibn\nDaud is the first to do so coherently and comprehensively from an\nAristotelian viewpoint. His proofs for the theses that every motion\nrequires a mover and that the existence of an infinite series in\nactuality is impossible are two cases in point. The same can be said\nof his expositions on the soul.\n",
