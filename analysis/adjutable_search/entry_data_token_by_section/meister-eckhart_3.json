Saying and Unsaying: Language and the Philosophical Eckhart\n\nJust as it is difficult to separate Eckhart the philosopher from\nEckhart the theologian or Eckhart the mystic, it is often equally\ndifficult to systematically tease apart Eckhart\u2019s speculative\nmetaphysics from his epistemological, practical, and pastoral views.\nTo be sure, with respect to the debate between the Dominicans and the\nFranciscans regarding the primacy of intellect versus will, Eckhart\nfalls decidedly on the side of his order, emphasizing that intellect\nand our rational nature (Middle High German:\nvern\u00fcnfticheit) are \u201cnobler\u201d than the will.\nHowever, this does not mean that Eckhart\u2019s philosophical focus\nis solely or even primarily on the cognitive or even the\nrational, at least as these terms are employed today. Even if\nhe agrees with his fellow Dominicans that human beings\u2019 rational\nnature represents the aspect in which they most closely resemble the\nDivine, not only does the late medieval understanding of\n\u201crational nature\u201d goes far beyond the mere ability to\nreason, Eckhart himself claims that true wisdom and genuine knowledge\nof God involves leaving reason (or at least discursive\nreasoning) behind (Van Dyke 2019, 2022). This\n\u201csapiential\u201d approach establishes a tight connection\nbetween cosmology (the \u201ctop-down\u201d order of reality and\ndivine creation), the pursuit of wisdom (the \u201cbottom-up\u201d\norder of knowledge and human intellection), and the perfection of the\nhuman being (a rightly-ordered will grounded in the divine reality).\nStill, as discussed in more detail below, creating, knowing, and\nwilling all involve fundamental motions of intellection for Eckhart:\nontologically on the part of God (in \u201cbirthing\u201d creation\nvia an \u201coverflowing\u201d act of divine causal knowing),\nepistemically and spiritually within the human being (in\n\u201cbirthing the Word\u201d in the depths of the soul via the\nnon-teleological \u201cnon-activity\u201d of silent\ncontemplation).\n\nOne way of thinking about how the various vertices of Eckhart\u2019s\nthought are connected to each other is to explore his nuanced approach\nto and use of language in the pursuit of what his student,\nHeinrich Seuse (Henry Suso), would later characterize in his widely\nread Horologium Sapientiae as the highest form of philosophy,\na philosophia spiritualis (one which Seuse took Eckhart to\nembody). Not only does the Meister engage in a kind of \u201cserious\nplay\u201d with words and language in both his Latin and German\nwritings, much of his work ultimately revolves around the ways in\nwhich words, especially understood as \u201csigns\u201d or\n\u201cimages\u201d, can both reveal and obscure. This tension is\nplayed out in a dynamic, distinctly Eckhartian dialectic that moves\nback and forth between saying and \u201cunsaying\u201d (Sells 1994),\nunivocity and equivocity (Mojsisch 1983 [2001]; Wendlinder 2014),\nspeech and silence (Duclow 1984)\u2014between the limits of finite\nhuman language and the self-communication of the Divine Intellect in\nthe \u201cEternal Word\u201d (i.e., Christ). In fact, despite his\nstrong apophatic tendencies, the speculative aspect of Eckhart\u2019s\nmystagogy might best be characterized as a philosophy of the\nWord, according to which the second person of the Christian\nTrinity (understood as the divine logos or scholastic\nratio) represents the metaphysical threshold between the\nhuman and the divine, as well as the medium by which the timeless,\nsingular Godhead (the \u201cOne\u201d of Neoplatonist philosophy) is\n\u201ctranslated\u201d\u2014linguistically, epistemically, and even\nontologically\u2014into the discursivity and multiplicity\ncharacteristic of the grammar, thought, and very existence of\ncreatures.\n\nTherefore, although it is to some extent misleading and anachronistic\nto carve up Eckhart\u2019s thought into distinct philosophical\nsubdisciplines, to borrow one of Eckhart\u2019s favorite\n\u201chermeneutical keywords\u201d (Ruh 1985: 96)\u2014namely\nin quantum (MHG: als verre)\u2014it may\nnevertheless be helpful to explore his philosophical views insofar\nas they might be said to fall under various contemporary\nphilosophical categories, using his approach to language,\ninterpretation, and communication as a guide. In practice, however,\nthese different aspects of his philosophical system were not intended\nto be thought independently of one another.\n",
