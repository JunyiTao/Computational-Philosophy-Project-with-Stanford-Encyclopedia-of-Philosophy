    "main_text": "Neutral Monism || Mind and Matter Revisited\n1.3 Mind and Matter Revisited\n\nMost extant versions of neutral monism seem to acknowledge that, in\naddition to the basic neutral entities, there exist derivative,\nnon-basic, and non-neutral ones\u2014mental and physical entities,\nfor example. This raises the question about the relationship between\nthese two kinds of entities. Every answer to this question faces two\nchallenges. On the one hand there is the threat of elimination of the\nnon-basic entities (see section 4.1); on the other hand there is the\nthreat that the non-basic, non-neutral entities turn into elements of\nultimate reality, thereby putting an end to neutral monism.\n\nThe question of the relationship between basic and non-basic entities\nis a contested topic among the traditional neutral monists (Wishon\n2021). James holds that \u201cpure experience\u201d constitutes an\ninterconnected continuum out of which different portions become\n\u201cmental\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d depending on their\ncontext, their relations to other such portions, and the purposes they\nserve and/or effects they result in (see 2.2 below). In contrast, Mach\nand Russell arguably hold that the non-basic entities are composed\nof\u2014or perhaps merely practical groupings of\u2014a multitude of\ndiscrete neutral entities organized by physical and/or psychological\ncausal-functional relations.\n\nMost contemporary neutral monists agree that the basic neutral\nentities are related to the non-basic, non-neutral ones by way of\ngrounding relations. But many questions remain about the precise\nnature of these grounding relations and of their relata. In any case,\nneutral monists face the daunting challenge of explaining (or\nexplaining away) the features associated with both mental and physical\nentities solely in terms of the basic neutral ones, their aspects, and\ntheir relations.\n",
