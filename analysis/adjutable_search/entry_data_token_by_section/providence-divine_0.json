    "main_text": "Logical Consistency and Inductive Evidence\n1. Logical Consistency and Inductive Evidence\n\nWhat is described above is the problem of evil. Because evil\nposes the most difficult problems for traditional views of divine\nprovidence, this discussion will be organized around the theme of\nevil. In its classical formulation, the problem of evil is a problem\nof logical consistency. The opponent of theism alleges that a triad of\nproperties traditionally held to belong to God\u2019s nature \u2014\nomniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence \u2014 are not jointly\nconsistent with the existence of evil in the world. An omniscient God,\nwe must assume, would have knowledge of the evil in the world. An\nomnibenevolent God would desire to halt or prevent it, and an\nomnipotent God should be able to do so. Yet evil is rife. It must be,\nthen, that God lacks at least one of the triad of attributes, and\nperhaps all of them. Perhaps as creator he is somewhat in the dark as\nto what evils may occur, and once they appear it is too late to\nforestall them. On the other hand, it may be that evil is endemic\n\u2014 built into the structure of any world, so that even God is\npowerless to prevent it. Or, maybe he just doesn\u2019t care, and has\nlong since turned his attention to projects more interesting than\nnurturing our feeble destinies. Whatever the reason, the argument\nruns, he is not the God of Abraham, of Jesus, and of Mohammed. Their\nGod simply would not permit wanton wrongdoing, nor would he allow the\nsuffering and duress under which all creation labors. So while the\npresence of evil in the world does not serve to prove there is no God\nat all, it does show there is no God of the kind adumbrated in\nreligious tradition.\n\nThe logical problem of evil may be countered with a logical rejoinder.\nThe fact is that the three perfections described above are not by\nthemselves sufficient to exclude the existence of evil in creation. To\nget that result we have to add a crucial premise to the argument put\nforth by opponents of theism: that there can be no justification for\nevil, no good reason why a God with the attributes in question would\ncreate a world that contained it. But why suppose this is so? Perhaps\nthere is some good or goods that are possible only in a world that\ncontains or at least permits evil, and without which creation would be\nvastly inferior to what it is. If that were true, then an all-good and\nall-loving God would not shrink from creating a world that contained\nthe evil necessary for that good or goods to be\n achieved.[1]\n So there is no final inconsistency here, and the theist may wish to\nconclude on that basis that the problem of evil is resolved. But not\nyet. For the opponent may concede that the presence of evil in the\nworld does not entail that there is no God of the kind\nreligious tradition postulates. Still, he may hold, it gives us good\ninductive reason for thinking there is no such God. The pervasiveness\nand profundity of the evil that occurs, the fact that it so often\nfalls upon the innocent and helpless, and the simple fact that we can\nsee no good coming from most of it are more than enough reason,\naccording to this argument, for any rational person to reject the God\nof tradition. What good could possibly justify the Holocaust, or\nwholesale destruction of civilian populations in war? Or, lest the\nnumbers submerge the agony, consider just a single case of innocent\nsuffering, posed by William Rowe: a fawn burned horribly in a forest\nfire somewhere removed from any human awareness, doomed to days of\nlingering suffering before inevitable death (1979, 337). We are unable\nto discern any good coming from this single instance of evil, and the\nsame could doubtless be said for millions of others. What more reason\ncould a rational person demand for rejecting the God of our\nfathers?\n\nThis so-called inductive or evidential argument from evil may be met\nwith a response similar to the one directed against the logical\nargument, for the fact is that it too involves assumptions which, when\nbrought to light, seem questionable. It assumes that for each instance\nof evil that occurs, we humans will be able to detect any good toward\nwhich it might be directed, and that we will be able to tell whether\nthe good is achieved, whether it was worth the evil sustained in\nreaching it, and whether it could better have been achieved without\nthe attendant evil. Again, however, why assume any of this is so? It\nis not obvious, in the first place, that goods and evils are\ncommensurable in the way this argument seems to suppose\u2014that is,\nthat we are able to grade goods and evils on a common scale, and then\nmeasure the value of the good against the bad (Swinburne 1998, ch.\n13). But even if we could do this, an all-powerful, all-knowing and\nall-loving God could easily have aims exceeding any we have ever\nimagined. How they are achieved at all, much less the role sin and\nsuffering may play in their achievement, could in principle escape us\nutterly (Howard-Snyder 1996). If so, then we would still be in no\nposition to make the kinds of determinations about the role evil plays\nin the world, and how dispensable it may be, that the evidential\nargument presupposes. Still less should we expect to be able to make\nsuch determinations in every case, which is what the argument demands.\nAs with the logical problem of evil, then, the theist may greet the\nexperiential problem with a stand-pat position. Neither argument goes\nthrough unless we make assumptions we have no reason to make, and\nwhich when brought to light seem positively implausible.\n\nStill, evil is troubling, and anyone troubled by it is likely to be\nleft unsatisfied by the stand-pat response. For one thing, the\nargument cuts both ways. If we are unable to discern God\u2019s\npurposes then just as he may turn out to be a far better being than\nour experience would indicate, so also he may turn out to be far\nworse: a positively evil or incompetent God, undeserving even of\nregard, let alone worship. Moreover, this response seems out of\nkeeping with the spirit of the Western religious tradition. That\ntradition is at home with the concept of mystery: it speaks often of\naspects of God and his relationship to the world that outreach us, in\nthat our intellects are not finally able to grasp them. But seldom if\never does the tradition treat mystery as totally impenetrable. Just\nthe opposite: the whole point of the theological enterprise is to\nenable the believer to understand, however imperfectly, the nature of\nGod and the plan of salvation. It is hard to see how this aim can be\nachieved if a phenomenon as central as evil must be held to escape all\ncomprehension, nor is there any special reason to expect such a thing.\nRather, it is in keeping with the hope of the believer that there\nshould be available some glimpse of the good accomplished through the\npresence of sin and suffering in the world, even if in the actual\nstruggle with them one\u2019s best ally is faith. If this is correct,\nthen the theist should not limit his options to the negative. Beyond\npointing out the shortcomings of the opponent\u2019s arguments, he\ncan and should try to offer a positive theodicy \u2014 that\nis, an account of the role evil plays in the world, and a\njustification for its presence. Such an effort is likely, of course,\nto end up incomplete. In particular, the theist may be unable in many\ncases to point to a good to which some evil that occurs is\nindispensable. But he may want to be able to offer a general\njustification for the presence of evil, and to describe some good or\ngoods which but for the occurrence of evil could not be achieved. The\nquestion is whether he can do so without compromising divine\nperfection.\n",
