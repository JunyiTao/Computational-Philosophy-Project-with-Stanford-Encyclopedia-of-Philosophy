    "main_text": "Socialism || Embracing Design\n5.1 Embracing Design\n\nAnalytical Marxists have typically broken with Marx\u2019s\n\u201cutopophobia\u201d, rejecting his view that providing detailed\ndescriptions of the socialist future is undemocratic, impossible, and\nunnecessary (Leopold 2016). Instead, analytical Marxists have embraced\nthe need for socialist design, and explicitly sought to develop\ncoherent and credible accounts: first, of the values of socialism;\nsecond, of the institutional, and other, arrangements which might best\nembody and promote those values; and third, of the forms that a\ntransition to those alternatives to capitalism might take (Elster\n& Moene 1989).\n\nThe values endorsed by analytical Marxism are familiar from the wider\nsocialist tradition (see entry on\n socialism, \u00a73.1).\n They include: equality; community; democracy; individual freedom; and\nself-realization. Within analytical Marxism, there is no general\nagreement about the character, weight, or potential to conflict, of\nthese. However some examples of their elaboration by analytical\nMarxists can be given.\n\nEquality is understood by Cohen as \u201csocialist equality\nof opportunity\u201d (distinct from bourgeois and left-liberal\nvariants of equality of opportunity). He construes this in a luck\negalitarian way, as seeking to correct for all unchosen disadvantage,\ndisadvantage for which the agent herself cannot be held responsible,\nwhether it reflects social or natural misfortune (2009a: 10\u201311).\nCommunity, on Cohen\u2019s account, requires \u201cthat\npeople care about, and, where necessary and possible, care for, one\nanother, and, too, care that they care about one another\u201d\n(2009a: 34\u201335). Meaningful community is put under strain when\nlarge inequalities obtain, and so this principle limits certain\ninequalities that the egalitarian principle alone would permit.\nDemocracy can be understood as extending beyond the\npolitical, narrowly construed, to require that people have\n\u201cbroadly equal access to the necessary means to participate\nmeaningfully in decisions\u201d affecting their lives as members of\nsociety (Wright 2010: 12). Individual freedom is defended in\na variety of increasingly demanding ways, from negative liberty,\nthough non-domination, to the \u201creal freedom\u201d of having\nsecurity, self-ownership, and the greatest possible opportunity to do\nwhatever you might want to do (Van Parijs 1995: ch. 1). And\nself-realisation is seen as valuable (for reasons involving\nwelfare and autonomy), even if considerations of feasibility and\ndesirability require some scaling down of the classic Marxist\nrequirement of \u201cthe full and free actualization and\nexternalization of the powers and the abilities of the\nindividual\u201d (Elster 1989: 131).\n\nTurning to the kind of institutions that might best embody and promote\nthese, and other, values, it might be said that analytical Marxists\ntypically proceed with a certain humility. In particular, they often\nacknowledge the inhuman and irrational dimensions of many\ntwentieth-century varieties of actually-existing-socialism. Wright\nfiguratively warns that, rather than having detailed maps with clear\ndestinations and identifiable routes, contemporary socialists are in\nthe position of early explorers with a \u201ccompass\u201d and some\nsense of the direction in which they want to go (2006). And Cohen\nwryly cautions that, although we have a reasonably clear sense of\nsocialist values \u201cwe now know that we do not now know\u201d how\nto design the social institutions that might best embody and promote\nthose goods (2009a: 81).\n\nTwo institutional examples of alternatives to capitalism\u2014market\nsocialism and basic income\u2014associated with analytical Marxism\nare sketched here (see also Arneson 1992).\n",
