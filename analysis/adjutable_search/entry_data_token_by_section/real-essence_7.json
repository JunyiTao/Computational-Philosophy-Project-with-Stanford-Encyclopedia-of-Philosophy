    "main_text": "Interpretive Issues || Real Essences, Internal Constitutions and Substance\n4.4 Real Essences, Internal Constitutions and Substance\n\nThroughout the Essay, Locke discusses real essences, internal\nconstitutions and substratum, and getting clear on each concept is\nrequired in order to produce a consistent and accurate interpretation\nof Locke on real essences. While it is not possible to do justice to\nany of the subjects here, it is important to give some background\nbefore proceeding. When Locke defines the \u2018real essence\u2019,\nhe often describes it as \u201cthat Constitution, whereon the\nProperties of these several things depended\u201d (III.iii.19). On\noccasion he even connects internal constitutions with essences as if\nthey were synonymous: \u201c[collections of simple ideas] are\ntherefore supposed to flow from the particular internal Constitution,\nor unknown Essence of that Substance\u201d (II.xxiii.3). Similarly,\nthe concept of \u2018substance\u2019 or \u2018substratum\u2019,\ni.e., pure substance in general, is conceived as an underlying\n\u2018thing\u2019 which supports, or upholds, the properties of\nbodies:\n\n\nThe Idea then we have, to which we give the general name\nSubstance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of\nthose Qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist,\nsine re substante, without something to support them, we call\nthat Support Substantia; which, according to the true import\nof the Word, is in plain English, standing under, or\nupholding. (II.xxiii.2)\n\n\nThe fact that the Essay uses internal constitutions,\nsubstance, and real essences as the underlying ground of the qualities\nof physical objects has led to some debate over the way Locke\nunderstands the relationship between the three concepts.\n\nRegarding the relationship between real essences and substance in\ngeneral, Michael Ayers has argued that Locke uses the terms\n\u2018substance\u2019 and \u2018real essence\u2019 as\nextensionally equivalent, but not intensionally equivalent. That is,\nboth terms refer to the same objects, but convey a very different\nmeaning. For Ayers, Locke\u2019s use of \u2018substance\u2019\nconveys the idea of a thing that supports properties, whereas\n\u2018real essence\u2019 conveys the idea of a submicroscopic\nmaterial structure that causes the powers of the object; these are\ndifferent meanings, but both terms refer to only one\n object.[6]\n\nOn the other hand, some Locke scholars interpret the concepts of\n\u2018substance\u2019 (in the sense of pure substance in general, or\n\u2018substratum\u2019) and \u2018real essence\u2019 as both\nintensionally and extensionally distinct because they play very\ndifferent philosophical roles. For example, according to Nicholas\nJolley, Locke employs the concept of a real essence when he is\naddressing issues of scientific explanation and he appeals to\nsubstratum when he is discussing the general concept of what it is to\nbe a thing (as opposed to a property or mode) (see Jolley\n1999, pp. 70\u201378).\n\nOn the relationship between real essences and internal constitutions,\none view is that Locke uses the terms \u2018real essence\u2019 and\n\u2018internal constitution\u2019 interchangeably. For example, in\nII.xxxi.6 he says \u201cits real Essence, or internal Constitution,\non which these Qualities depend, can be nothing but the Figure, Size,\nand Connexion of its solid Parts.\u201d Again in III.iii.19 he uses\n\u2018real essence\u2019 as if it were synonymous with\n\u2018internal constitution\u2019: \u201cIn all which, and the like\nChanges, \u2018tis evident, their real Essence, i.e. that\nConstitution, whereon the Properties of these several things depended,\nis destroy\u2019d, and perishes with them.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Susanna Goodin (1998) argues that \u2018real\nessence\u2019 and \u2018internal constitution\u2019 cannot be\nsynonymous because, according to Locke, real essences are unknowable\n(IV.vi.5 & 12), but internal constitutions are knowable\n(II.xxiii.12). One way to distinguish them is, as we saw above, to\nadopt the relativized view and interpret the real essence as the\ninternal constitution that underlies the nominally essential\nproperties, whereas the internal constitution of a substance is simply\nits physical make-up, independently of considerations of its nominal\nessence. So, on this view, Locke\u2019s uses of \u2018real\nessence\u2019 and \u2018internal constitution\u2019 are\nnon-synonymous technical terms.\n\nP. Kyle Stanford (1998), on the other hand, distinguishes real\nessences from internal constitutions by arguing that real essences, by\ndefinition, include the causal powers of the body, whereas the\ninternal constitution is simply its material components. Thus, for\nStanford, a real essence \u201cconsists of those features of an\nentity from which all of its observable or experienceable properties\ncan be logically deduced\u201d (Stanford 1998, p. 80). By contrast,\nknowledge of the internal constitution, qua mere material\ncomponents, entails no such deducibility. For example, in IV.vi.11 he\nsays that knowledge of the real essence of an object entails knowledge\nof all of its powers, but knowledge of mere material structure cannot\nentail that kind of knowledge. Moreover, in all the quotations where\nLocke talks about real essences, he does not just define them as a\nmaterial structure, but also as the causal grounds of the observable\nqualities of the body, indicating that the powers are included in the\ndefinition.\n",
