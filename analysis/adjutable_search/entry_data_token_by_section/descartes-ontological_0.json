    "main_text": "The Simplicity of the \u201cArgument\u201d\n1. The Simplicity of the \u201cArgument\u201d\n\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Descartes\u2019 version of the ontological\nargument is its simplicity. Indeed, it reads more like the report of an\nintuition than a formal proof. Descartes underscores the simplicity of\nhis demonstration by comparing it to the way we ordinarily establish\nvery basic truths in arithmetic and geometry, such as that the number\ntwo is even or that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to the\nsum of two right angles. We intuit such truths directly by inspecting\nour clear and distinct ideas of the number two and of a triangle. So,\nlikewise, we are able to attain knowledge of God\u2019s existence simply by\napprehending that necessary existence is included in the clear and\ndistinct idea of a supremely perfect being. As Descartes writes in the\nFifth Meditation:\n[1] But if the mere fact that I can produce from my thought\nthe idea of something entails that everything which I clearly and\ndistinctly perceive to belong to that thing really does belong to it,\nis not this a possible basis for another argument to prove the\nexistence of God? Certainly, the idea of God, or a supremely perfect\nbeing, is one that I find within me just as surely as the idea of any\nshape or number. And my understanding that it belongs to his nature\nthat he always exists is no less clear and distinct than is the case\nwhen I prove of any shape or number that some property belongs to its\nnature (AT 7:65; CSM 2:45).\n\n\nOne is easily misled by the analogy between the ontological argument\nand a geometric demonstration, and by the language of\n\u201cproof\u201d in this passage and others like it. Descartes does\nnot conceive of the ontological argument on the model of an Euclidean or\naxiomatic proof, in which theorems are derived from epistemically\nprior axioms and definitions.  On the contrary, he is drawing our\nattention to another method of establishing truths that informs our\nordinary practices and is non-discursive. This method employs\nintuition or, what is the same for Descartes, clear and distinct\nperception. It consists in unveiling the contents of our clear and\ndistinct ideas. The basis for this method is the rule for truth, which\nwas previously established in the Fourth Meditation. According to the\nversion of this rule invoked in the Fifth Meditation, whatever I\nclearly and distinctly perceive to be contained in the idea of\nsomething is true of that thing. So if I clearly and distinctly\nperceive that necessary existence pertains to the idea of a supremely\nperfect being, then such a being truly exists.\n\n\nAlthough Descartes maintains that God\u2019s existence is ultimately\nknown through intuition, he is not averse to presenting formal versions\nof the ontological argument. He never forgets that he is writing for a\nseventeenth-century audience, steeped in scholastic logic, that would\nhave expected to be engaged at the level of the Aristotelian syllogism.\nDescartes satisfies such expectations, presenting not one but at least\ntwo separate versions of the ontological argument. These proofs,\nhowever, are stunningly brief and betray his true intentions. One\nversion of the argument simply codifies the psychological process by\nwhich one intuits God\u2019s existence, in the manner described above:\nVersion A: \n\n\nWhatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to be contained in the\nidea of something is true of that thing.\nI clearly and distinctly perceive that necessary existence is\ncontained in the idea of God.\nTherefore, God exists.\n\n\n\n\nThe rule for truth appears here in the guise of the first premise,\nbut it is more naturally read as a statement of Descartes\u2019 own\nalternative method of \u201cdemonstration\u201d via clear and distinct perception\nor intuition. In effect, the first \u201cpremise\u201d is designed to instruct\nthe meditator on how to apply this method, the same role that the\nanalogy with a geometric demonstration serves in passage [1].\n\n\nWhen presenting this version of the argument in the First Replies,\nDescartes sets aside this first premise and focuses our attention on\nthe second. In so doing, he is indicating the relative unimportance of\nthe proof itself. Having learned how to apply Descartes\u2019 alternative\nmethod of reasoning, one need only perceive that necessary existence\npertains to the idea of a supremely perfect being. Once one attains\nthis perception, formal arguments are no longer required; God\u2019s\nexistence will be self-evident (Second Replies, Fifth Postulate; AT\n7:163\u20134; CSM 2:115).\n\n\nDescartes sometimes uses traditional arguments as heuristic devices,\nnot merely to appease a scholastically trained audience but to help\ninduce clear and distinct perceptions. This is evident for example in\nthe version of the ontological argument standardly associated with his\nname:\nVersion B: \n\n\nI have an idea of supremely perfect being, i.e. a being having all\nperfections.\nNecessary existence is a perfection.\nTherefore, a supremely perfect being exists.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this set of sentences has the surface structure of a formal\nargument, its persuasive force lies at a different level. A meditator\nwho is having trouble perceiving that necessary existence is contained\nin the idea of a supreme perfect being can attain this perception\nindirectly by first recognizing that this idea includes every\nperfection. Indeed, the idea of a supremely perfect being just is the\nidea of a being having all perfections. To attempt to exclude any or\nall perfections from the idea of a supremely being, Descartes observes,\ninvolves one in a contradiction and is akin to conceiving a mountain\nwithout a valley (or, better, an up-slope without a down-slope). Having\nformed this perception, one need only intuit that necessary existence\nis itself a perfection. It will then be clear that necessary existence\nis one of the attributes included in the idea of a supremely perfect\nbeing.\n\n\nWhile such considerations might suffice to induce the requisite\nclear and distinct perception in the meditator, Descartes is aiming a\ndeeper point, namely that there is a conceptual link between necessary\nexistence and each of the other divine perfections. It is important to\nrecall that in the Third Meditation, in the midst of the causal\nargument for the existence of God, the meditator already discovered\nmany of these perfections \u2014 omnipotence, omniscience, immutability,\neternality, simplicity, etc. Because our mind is finite, we normally\nthink of the divine perfections separately and \u201chence may not\nimmediately notice the necessity of their being joined together\u201d (First\nReplies, AT 7:119; CSM 2:85). But if we attend carefully to \u201cwhether\nexistence belongs to a supremely perfect being, and what sort of\nexistence it is\u201d we shall discover that we cannot conceive any one of\nthe other attributes while excluding necessary existence from it\n(ibid.).\n\n\nTo illustrate this point Descartes appeals to divine omnipotence. He\nthinks that we cannot conceive an omnipotent being except as existing.\nDescartes\u2019 illustration presupposes the traditional, medieval\nunderstanding of \u201cnecessary existence.\u201d When speaking of\nthis divine attribute, he sometimes uses the term\n\u201cexistence\u201d simpliciter as shorthand. But in his\nmore careful pronouncements he always insists on the phrase\n\u201cnecessary and eternal existence,\u201d which resonates with\ntradition. Medieval, scholastic philosophers often spoke of God as the\nsole \u201cnecessary being,\u201d by which they meant a being who\ndepends only on himself for his existence. This is the notion of\n\u201caseity\u201d or self-existence (a se esse). Since\nsuch a being does not depend on anything else for its existence, he\nhas neither a beginning nor an end, but is eternal. Returning to the\ndiscussion in the First Replies, one can see how omnipotence is linked\nconceptually to necessary existence in this traditional sense. An\nomnipotent or all-powerful being does not depend ontologically on\nanything (for if it did then it would not be omnipotent). It exists by\nits own power:\n[2] when we attend to immense power of this being, we shall\nbe unable to think of its existence as possible without also\nrecognizing that it can exist by its own power; and we shall infer from\nthis that this being does really exist and has existed from eternity,\nsince it is quite evident by the natural light that what can exist by\nits own power always exists. So we shall come to understand that\nnecessary existence is contained in the idea of a supremely perfect\nbeing \u2026. (ibid.)\n\n\nSome readers have thought that Descartes offers yet a third version of\nthe ontological argument in this passage (Wilson, 1978, 174\u201376), but\nwhether or not that was his intention is unimportant, since his\nprimary aim, as indicated in the last line, is to enable his meditator\nto intuit that necessary existence is included in the idea of\nGod. Since there is a conceptual link between the divine attributes, a\nclear and distinct perception of one provides a cognitive route to any\nof the others.\n\n\nAlthough Descartes sometimes uses formal versions of the ontological\nargument to achieve his aims, he consistently affirms that God\u2019s\nexistence is ultimately known through clear and distinct perception.\nThe formal versions of the argument are merely heuristic devices, to be\njettisoned once one has attained the requisite intuition of a supremely\nperfect being. Descartes stresses this point explicitly in the Fifth\nMeditation, immediately after presenting the two versions of the\nargument considered above:\n[3] whatever method of proof I use, I am always brought\nback to the fact that it is only what I clearly and distinctly perceive\nthat completely convinces me. Some of the things I clearly and\ndistinctly perceive are obvious to everyone, while others are\ndiscovered only by those who look more closely and investigate more\ncarefully; but once they have been discovered, the latter are judged to\nbe just as certain as the former. In the case of a right-angled\ntriangle, for example, the fact that the square on the hypotenuse is\nequal to the square on the other two sides is not so readily apparent\nas the fact that the hypotenuse subtends the largest angle; but once\none has seen it, one believes it just as strongly. But as regards God,\nif I were not overwhelmed by philosophical prejudices, and if the\nimages of things perceived by the senses did not besiege my thought on\nevery side, I would certainly acknowledge him sooner and more easily\nthan anything else. For what is more manifest than the fact that the\nsupreme being exists, or that God, to whose essence alone existence\nbelongs, exists? (AT 7:68\u201369; CSM 2:47)\n\n\nHere Descartes develops his earlier analogy between the (so-called)\nontological argument and a geometric demonstration. He suggests that\nthere are some meditators for whom God\u2019s existence is immediately\nmanifest; for them God\u2019s existence is akin to an axiom or definition in\ngeometry, such as that the hypotenuse of a right triangle subtends its\nlargest angle. But other meditators, whose minds are confused and mired\nin sensory images, must work much harder, and might even require a\nproof to attain the requisite clear and distinct perception. For them,\nGod\u2019s existence is akin to the Pythagorean Theorem. The important point\nis that both kinds of meditators ultimately attain knowledge of God\u2019s\nexistence by clearly and distinctly perceiving that necessary existence is\ncontained in the idea of supremely perfect being. Once one has achieved\nthis perception, God\u2019s existence will be manifest or, as Descartes says\nelsewhere, \u201cself-evident\u201d (per se notam) (Second Replies,\nFifth Postulate; AT 7: 164; CSM 2:115).\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 contemporaries would have been surprised by this last\nremark. While reviewing an earlier version of the ontological argument,\nAquinas had rejected the claim that God\u2019s existence is self-evident, at\nleast with respect to us. He argued that what is self-evident cannot be\ndenied without contradiction, but God\u2019s existence can be denied.\nIndeed, the proverbial fool says in his heart \u201cThere is no God\u201d (Psalm\n53.1).\n\n\nWhen confronted with this criticism by a contemporary objector,\nDescartes tries to find common ground: \u201cSt. Thomas asks whether\nexistence is self-evident as far as we are concerned, that is, whether\nit is obvious to everyone; and he answers, correctly, that it is not\u201d\n(First Replies, AT 7:115; CSM 2:82). Descartes interprets Aquinas to be\nclaiming that God\u2019s existence is not self-evident to everyone,\nwhich is something with which he can agree. Descartes does not hold\nthat God\u2019s existence is immediately self-evident, or self-evident to\neveryone, but that it can become self-evident to some careful and\nindustrious meditators.\n",
