    "preamble": "\n\nAlthough widely and commonly confused with republicanism, civic\nhumanism forms a separate and distinct phenomenon in the history of\nWestern political thought. Republicanism is a political philosophy\nthat defends a concept of freedom as non-domination, and identifies\nthe institutions that protect it (Pettit 1999). In particular,\nrepublicanism stands against two alternative theories of politics. The\nfirst is despotism, especially as manifested in any form of one-man\nrule; a republic is self-governing, and so are its denizens. The\nsecond is liberalism, which posits the primacy of the autonomous\nindividual vis-\u00e0-vis public order and government; the\nrepublican values civic engagement in order to realize a form of\nliberty achievable only in and through the community. Republican\ntheorists sometimes refer to writings by historically antecedent\nauthors, such as Aristotle or Machiavelli, but their concern is not\nprimarily accurate interpretation. Rather, to the extent that they\nshow an interest in the past, it is as a source of ideas that they\nfind useful.\n\nBy contrast, civic humanism is a historiographical construct. As\nconventionally employed by scholars, the term refers to a group of\nthinkers who emerged during the period of the Italian Renaissance,\nespecially in Florence, and who were committed to public engagement\n(in theory as well as practice) and whose values were fundamentally\nantithetical to the medieval past. The \u201cinvention\u201d of\ncivic humanism is primarily associated with Hans Baron\n(1900\u20131988), the famed German-American historian (Fubini 1992).\nAlthough he first used the phrase in its original German form\n(B\u00fcrgerhumanismus) as early as 1925, its popularity\nstems from the publication in 1955 of his classic book The Crisis\nof the Early Italian Renaissance: Civic Humanism and Republican\nLiberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny (revised 1966). In\nthis volume, as well as in later writings that built upon it (many\ncollected in Baron 1968 and 1988), he developed what has come to be\ncalled the \u201cBaron thesis\u201d (Witt 1996; Hankins 1995). Baron\nwas not, however, the first scholar to propose that the form of\nhumanism that emerged during the fifteenth century in the Italian\ncities mainly promoted the civic vita activa rather than the\nliterary and philological pursuits ordinarily ascribed to the\nhumanists. In two books from 1952 and 1954, written and published in\nItalian, Eugenio Garin defended a position almost identical to that of\nBaron\u2019s: Renaissance humanism, especially as propounded in\nFlorence, reflects a pronounced shift from the emphasis on\ncontemplation typical of the Middle Ages to the priority of civil\naction to attain a common good (Garin 1947 [1965]). (If not for purely\ncontingent reasons, the historiographical label for civic humanism\nmight readily have been \u201cthe Garin thesis\u201d.) In the\npresent context, it should be noted that some advocates of civic\nhumanism were disposed toward republicanism, but the latter is not\nentailed by the former.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Baron Thesis\n\nBaron used the term civic humanism to describe the fusion of two\ndistinct currents of Florentine thought: apolitical so-called\n\u201cPetrarchan\u201d humanism, on the one hand, and the Guelf\ntradition of patriotic resistance by the Florentine city-state to\nimperial domination, on the other (Kallendorf 1996). The\n\u201crebirth\u201d of ancient letters and wisdom (studia\nhumanitas) marked a revolutionary change in the European mind,\nbut it remained limited to the contemplative pleasure and edification\nof quietist poets and scholars until the beginning of the fifteenth\ncentury. Thereafter, it merged with the assertive defense of the\nsovereign independence of the increasingly rich, powerful, and\nconfident merchant cities of Italy. The fusion was effected, according\nto Baron, as a response to a crisis, namely, the reaction of the\nintellectual and political leadership of Florence to the aggressive\nexpansionism of the despots of Milan. The resulting exaltation of\nliberty combined patriotic self-defense with the upholding of a\nrepublican way of life that departed from medieval ideals by asserting\nworldly values and embracing the active life in a manner evocative of\nthe republics of antiquity. According to Baron\u2019s thesis, in the\nface of military danger the patterns of society, economy, and politics\ncame to cohere in a culture, i.e., an ethos infused with an\neducational vision. The main champions of this were the great\nchancellors of the Florentine Republic, Coluccio Salutati and,\nespecially, Leonardo Bruni, top civil servants and public\nintellectuals combined, who restored the practical pertinence of\nclassical learning in the process of establishing the terms of a new\ncivil consensus.\n\nBeyond seeking to identify civic humanism with a particular time and\nplace, Baron studied the political culture of Renaissance Florence as\nan instance of an exemplary mode of communal existence. Florentine\ncivic humanism represented for him furthermore a decisive turning\npoint in history. For Baron it was an epochal event that, by looking\nbackward to antiquity, pointed forward to modernity\u2014a movement\nthat he embraced wholeheartedly as a liberating, civilizing,\nprogressive process. The advent of civic humanism marked for Baron the\nvictory of secular economic, social, and political ideals versus the\nasceticism, religious obscurantism, and hierarchy of the Middle Ages\n(see Yoran 2007). Civic humanism provided the vital vehicle for the\ntranslation of the exalted ancient idea of citizenship to the modern\nage. The humanist defense of republican liberty against monarchical\ntyranny announced for him the beginnings of modern democratic thought,\nelevated by an educational ideal of classical inspiration, and\naccompanied by renewed cultural creativity. Civic humanism was thus\nthe harbinger of the unequivocally positive trends in modern European\ncivilization. The value of such achievements appeared all the more\ncompelling since they were not theoretical postulates derived from\nabstract speculation, but represented historically realized\nexempla.\n\nBaron\u2019s reconstruction of civic humanism was not only directed\nagainst other-worldly values and notions of medieval deference, but\nalso against different modes of construing modernity in terms of the\nautonomy of the self. At issue here, beyond the characterization of a\nhistorical period, was the definition and evaluation of modernity\nitself. Baron wished to see the autonomous humanity he perceived\nemerging in quattrocento Florence integrated within a constitutional\nframe and anchored by patriotic attachment to the community. Baron\nadvocated a vast scholarly program to establish the Italian humanist\ntradition as a major source of modernity. The polities he posited as\ncommendable are not conceived as formal frames of individual life\ngoals\u2014in other words, empty liberalism\u2014but textured wholes\ninto which human autonomy is woven. To state it somewhat\nanachronistically, accepting the nexus of public solidarity embedded\nin civic humanism, and viewing it as an equivalent of civil society,\nBaron\u2019s thesis overlaps considerably with today\u2019s\ncommunitarianism.\n2. Civic Humanism and Republicanism\n\nAs previously suggested, both Baron and Garin generally regarded civic\nhumanism as an equivalent to or as a particular variant of\nrepublicanism, meaning a conception of politics in which government is\nin principle the common business of the citizens. The\n\u201ccity\u201d provides the environment\u2014a public\nspace\u2014for human fulfillment. More specifically, they appear to\nbelieve that civic humanism derives from classical republicanism of\nsome variety ascribed to Aristotle, Cicero, and Polybius among others\n(although knowledge of Book VI of the latter\u2019s\nHistories before the beginning of the sixteenth century is\ndisputed [Nederman 2016; Hankins 2016; Monfasani 2016]). Civic\nhumanism is linked in principle to a classical educational program\nthat goes beyond the formative capacity of participatory citizenship\nitself and involves the conscious revival of ancient ideals.\nRepublican candor, simplicity of manner, opposition to ostentation,\nluxury and lucre, are common, though not universal, republican themes.\nCivic humanists, it is said, promote republican ideals responding to\nthe fragility of the republic and the need to provide against its\ncorruption and decay with the passage of time.\n\nAccording to Baron, numerous civic humanist theorists emphasized that\nthe republic requires widespread civic virtue, i.e., the active\nengagement of citizens united by a concern for the common good. The\nvirtues of citizenship are in turn developed and enhanced by being\nexercised in upholding republican political and legal institutions and\nmaking them work by being involved in their operation. Republican life\nis then thought to be formative of the public spirit on which it\nrests. Republican freedom depends on constant civic activity. The\npolity is taken to cohere by means of the common acceptance of\nstandards of justice that are more than procedural rules. The purpose\nof the commonwealth is the realization of human potentiality,\nencouraging the flowering of all forms of creativity and ingenuity\ninsofar as they contribute to public welfare. The republic is the\nnecessary medium of self-realization, not merely the condition of\npossibility of private endeavors. There is a link furthermore between\nthe freedom of the citizen and the independence of the republic.\nCitizen armies and the right to bear arms are therefore common\npostulates of republican theory. Adherents to the \u201cBaron\nthesis\u201d use all of these confluences of civic humanism and\nrepublicanism to support their contention that the two positions are\ninseparable.\n\nOne important extension of Baron\u2019s position has been proposed by\nJohn Pocock (1975). Pocock takes Renaissance civic humanism to be an\nestimable manifestation of republican and patriotic collective\nsentiment. For Pocock as well as Baron, civic humanism must be\nconsidered the response to a crisis amounting to what Machiavelli\nwould call an occasione, a moment of disorder that gives\nscope to the formative activity of a new beginning that nevertheless\nlooks to the past in order to guide its future. The dilemma faced by\nFlorentine civic humanists, according to Pocock, was to fit the idea\nof an Aristotelian polis within the framework of a Christian\nunderstanding of time. One answer to the experience of disorder was\nthe explicitly millenarian exaltation of the leader of\nFlorence\u2019s republic from 1494 to 1498, the Dominican preacher\nGirolamo Savonarola. In Pocock\u2019s view, civic humanism provided a\nsecular alternative to Savanarola\u2019s prophetic republicanism, in\nthe form of a revived Aristotelian \u201cscience of virtue\u201d as\nthe means of overcoming the republic\u2019s temporal finitude. Given\ndoubts that have been raised with regard to the philosophical depth of\nthe supposed Aristotelianism of the Florentine humanists, another\nrecent scholar of civic humanism, Quentin Skinner has, as an\nalternative, stressed its Roman rather than Hellenic antecedents\n(Bock, Skinner, & Viroli 1990: 121\u2013141). This is not just a\nmatter of identifying sources. Skinner\u2019s revised position means\nrather that in his view, civic humanism advocated active citizenship\nas a means to liberty from foreign and domestic domination, rather\nthan as a self-fulfilling human end. In more recent times, Skinner has\nshifted his position from an historical claim to an entirely\nphilosophical one, in line with the purely theoretical conception of\nrepublicanism discussed above (e.g., Skinner 1998).\n\nIronically, in Pocock\u2019s adaptation of Baron\u2019s thesis,\nvirtue is opposed to property, and it is the urban, bourgeois\nentrepreneurs and the chancery of the modernizing state, the very\ncreators of civic humanism in Baron\u2019s mind, that reside on the\nwrong side of the fence. Baron\u2019s civic humanists advocated a\ndeparture from the medieval ideals of contemplation and asceticism to\nassert an active life that included trade and profit (Jurdjevic 2001:\n727\u2013728). In the Pocockean version of republicanism, civic\nvirtue is opposed to a vision of citizenship that embraces the private\npursuit of gain. This kind of virtuous polity cannot, however, be\nFlorence\u2014and certainly not Baron\u2019s Florence\u2014the\npalazzi of which were built with the profits of banking,\nmanufacturing, international trade, and interest on the city\u2019s\npublic debt. Pocock\u2019s rearward glance to Aristotle (and even\nSkinner\u2019s to Rome) did not take into account the historical\nrealities of the Renaissance Italian cities, Florence in\nparticular.\n3. Varieties of Civic Humanism\n\nBaron\u2019s interpretation assumes that civic humanism has a core\nthat holds together all of those with whom is associated. In other\nwords, there is presumed to be a single set of principles to which all\ncivic humanists must subscribe in order to merit that appellation.\nPocock attempted to circumvent this problem by treating republicanism\nin linguistic rather than programmatic terms. As such it was available\nto be picked up, selectively and thematically, as circumstances\ndictated or allowed. Taken on its face, Pocock\u2019s conception of\nrepublicanism invites us, in turn, say the same about civic humanism,\nnamely, that it need not be equated with a single political position\n(that is, republicanism). Although Pocock does not acknowledge it, the\ngeneral discursive ambit of civic humanism licenses Italian thinkers\nto apply its language to an extensive range of political systems and\nphenomena.\n\nJames Hankins has taken this point a step further by severing Italian\nRenaissance humanism from political forms entirely. Hankins aims to\nchallenge directly Baron, Pocock and similar advocates of civic\nhumanism who equate it with republican liberty, while also tempering\nthe long-standing alternative view that humanism was primarily an\napolitical literary and cultural movement (2019: xii). Hankins argues\ninstead that humanists were driven by what he terms \u201cvirtue\npolitics,\u201d by which he means improvement of \u201cthe character\nand wisdom of the ruling class with a view to bringing about a happy\nand flourishing commonwealth\u201d (2019: 37). The great humanists\nthus ought to be understood not as advocates for any particular\n\u201cconstitutional form of the polity\u201d or for \u201cthe\nexpress consent of the governed\u201d (2019: 37). Rather, political\nlegitimacy rested on moral legitimacy. Only with Machiavelli, Hankins\ncontends, was the link to the virtue that humanism propounded\ndecisively broken (2019: 449\u2013475). But pace Hankins\n(2019: xxi), humanists in fact disputed about which type of government\nwas most desirable, as shall be discussed presently, and certainly did\nnot discount that one system should be preferred over others.\n3.1. Leonardo Bruni\n\nFor Baron and many others, Leonardo Bruni (1369\u20131444) was\nregarded to be the paragon of Italian civic humanism (Hankins 1995:\n327; Witt 2003: 392\u2013442), the exemplar of the synthesis of\nhumanistic study and public engagement: he served twice as the\nChancellor of Florence and was intermittently employed in\nadministrative posts by the papacy. At the same time, Bruni was a\nprodigious author and translator, composing a multi-volume history of\nthe Florentine people (based on his access to primary sources),\nproducing Latin versions of works by Aristotle (including the\nPolitics) and other Greek texts, writing biographies of\nnotable Italians for popular consumption, among many additional\nliterary activities.\n\nMost significantly for current purposes, Bruni used his great\nerudition to defend and promote the cause of republican government,\nespecially as practiced in Florence during his day. His\nLaudatio (1403\u20131404 [1978]) are paeans to the city\ngenerally (for instance, in terms of architectural and artistic\nbeauty, its cleanliness, its locale, and its plentiful resources) but\nalso specifically to the virtue of its citizens and its institutions.\n(Recall a central feature of the \u201cBaron thesis\u201d mentioned\nabove derived from the claim that the Milan crisis of 1402 gave birth\nto civic humanism in both theory and practice, with Bruni as its\nexemplary exponent.) Like his contemporaries, Bruni believed that\nFlorence had been founded by the Romans during the republican period,\nrendering its citizens characteristically lovers of freedom who stood\nalso opposed to imperial and tyrannical rule. This heritage from Rome\nalso yielded the source for Florence\u2019s mild and peaceful\nrelations with other Italian cities and their citizens, signaled by\nits protection of all Italy from the domination threatened by the\nMilanese. Florence was, in effect, the savior of the Italian\npeople.\n\nBoth the Panegyric and the Laudatio explain the\ngreatness of Florence in terms of its self-governing political system.\nThe institutions both foster and are fostered by the public virtue of\ncitizens. Bruni postulates a triad of fundamental republican\nprinciples that Florence draws together: liberty (libertas),\nequality (aequalitas), and just law (ius). The\nFlorentine constitution is so organized that citizens are free because\nthey are equal before the law. These qualities bring us to one of\nBruni\u2019s favorite concepts in his political theory: harmonious\ncooperation and balance among all groups and classes within the city.\nOther Italian cities, he observes, are rife with class conflict\nbetween the great men and mass of the people. The Florentine republic\ndiffers because the entire body of its citizens participate, as\nappropriate, in the government, which, because it is checked in its\npower, resists the temptation of tyranny, whether by the few or the\nmany. Civic humanism, at least as understood by Baron and scholars\nworking in a similar vein, is perfectly captured in the accounts of\nFlorence in the Panegyric and Laudatio.\n3.2 Coluccio Salutati and Aurelio Lippo Brandolini\n\nYet the fundamental premises of Renaissance civic humanism do not\nnecessarily entail republicanism. Many of the cities of\nfifteenth-century Italy were in fact governed by individuals who were\nself-styled princes or by oligarchic dynasties. As Quentin Skinner\nobserved many years ago (1978: 118\u2013128), humanists were not\nadverse to modification of the virtues associated with civic\ngovernment to suit conditions of a princely regime (see also Skinner\n2002: 118\u2013159). Baron sought to excuse or dismiss such ideas,\nbut his arguments have been challenged.\n\nOne of the most notable figures to take up this agenda was Coluccio\nSalutati (1331\u20131406) in a treatise entitled De tyranno\n(On Tyranny; 1400 [1927]. Salutati had been not only\nBruni\u2019s instructor but also his immediate predecessor as\nChancellor of the Florentine republic. In the view of Salutati, there\nare valid reasons that one should stand prepared to countenance\ntyrannical rulers at times. In support of what might seem at first\nglance an odd position for a humanist to embrace, he introduces a\ndistinction between two types of tyrants: those who rule without valid\ntitle (usurpers) and those who possess a legitimate claim to office\nbut use their powers unlawfully and unjustly as a result of their\nprideful characters. This difference is decisive for Salutati, whose\nmain concern is with the propriety of slaying tyrants in general and\nwith the murder of Julius Caesar in particular.\n\nAccording to Salutati, the appropriate treatment of a tyrant is wholly\ndependent upon whether or not he is a usurper. If so, then those\nsubject to him may invoke the Roman law principle that it is\n\u201clawful to repel by force the assailant of an individual or a\npiece of property and if he persists, to kill him\u201d in order to\njustify resistance to a tyrant (1927: 86). By contrast, Salutati\ncondemns those who argue that wicked princes ought to be killed even\nwhen they hold their office by right. He asserts that only the public\nauthority that placed a ruler in office (whether a superior or the\ncommunity) enjoys the right to remove him from power; private persons,\nacting in their own right, have no say in the matter.\n\nSalutati rounds off his treatise by applying his argument to the case\nof Caesar. He purports to prove (in a highly polemical refutation of\nCicero) that Caesar was not a usurper, but instead held legitimate\noffice authorized by the Roman people. Indeed, Salutati maintains that\nif Caesar seemed to behave tyrannically, it was because the tumultuous\ncondition of the times called for such conduct. Caesar is to be\npraised as the savior of Rome, not condemned as a tyrant.\nConsequently, it was entirely wrong for private citizens to slay\nCaesar, since he had not usurped public power. Moreover, to the extent\nthat he was serving the common good, the Romans as a people had no\nlegitimate warrant to remove him from office. Salutati thus\napproaches, if he does not explicitly endorse, a conception of\nbenevolent despotism that challenges the usual bases for\ndistinguishing between king and tyrant.\n\nAnother Florentine humanist\u2014albeit it not of the stature of\nBruni and Salutati\u2014went still further in praising monarchy.\nAurelio Lippo Brandolini (c.1454\u20131497) in his De\ncomparatione reipublicae et regni (On the Comparison of\nRepublic and Kingdoms; c. 1490) defends kingship against the\ncharge made by his fellow Italians (especially, Florentines) that it\nwas inferior to republican government. Writing at the court of the\nHungarian King Mattias, whose patronage he briefly enjoyed, Brandolini\nconstructed a dialogue between a Florentine merchant, Domenico, and\nthe king himself, in which every conventional rationale for the\nsuperiority of republics to other constitutional systems, especially\nmonarchies, is proposed and examined, only to be decimated. Regardless\nof whether or not Brandolini wrote De comparatione merely as\npiece of flattery for King Mattias, his arguments for kingship still\nwarrant serious attention.\n\nIn the first two books of the dialogue, Domenico\u2019s case in favor\nof the superiority of republican constitutions is demolished by\nMattias. This is hardly what might be expected of a civic humanist, at\nleast if one regards Bruni as the paradigmatic instance thereof. But\nBrandolini manages to use precisely the tools of his humanist training\nto dismiss the main values that led humanists to praise the Florentine\nrepublican constitution. Of more immediate interest, at the beginning\nof the third and final book of De comparatione, the\ndiscussion turns to the examination and defense of the proposition\nthat the governance of one person is best. Initially, this position is\nsupported by means of a set of analogies to the helmsman, the military\ncommander, and the head of the household. Thereafter, the debate\nconcentrates on how the rule of a single excellent man constitutes a\nsafeguard against the real possibility of destructive factionalism\nthat flows from governance by the many.\n\nBy way of proof, Mattias narrates a notably revisionist account of\nRoman history, according to which the early kings successfully\npreserved peace and concord. Their replacement by consuls led\nnaturally and inescapably to the decline of the city over time into a\nseries of civil wars in which various men contended for power. In the\nsame passage, Mattias indicates that Lorenzo de\u2019Medici in\nFlorence achieved the same effect as did the Roman monarchs, namely,\neliminating from the city the tumults caused by factionalism. A\nsingle, defining political will yields unity. Brandolini thereby\nadopts a position precisely opposed to Bruni, who, as has been seen,\nclaimed that the Florentine republican constitution was the source of\nharmonization among the classes. Brandolini and Bruni focus on\nprecisely the same problem\u2014how to curb faction leading to class\nconflict\u2014but they arrive at radically different conclusions.\nArguably, nothing about Bruni\u2019s position is inherently more\nexemplary of civic humanist than Brandolini\u2019s.\n3.3. Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini\n\nIt would be difficult to find anyone during the fifteenth century\nbetter qualified than Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (1405\u20131464) to\nclaim the mantle of civic humanism. As was the case with the authors\nalready discussed he was steeped in the studia humanitas from\na fine Florentine education. An almost exact contemporary of the great\nhumanists Palmieri, Valla and Patrizi, he enjoyed a sterling\nreputation for his writings; his letters, in particular, compare\nfavorably in their style as well as their substance with the best of\nhumanist literature. He held positions in the imperial court as a\nsecretary and diplomat, and eventually worked his way up the ladder of\necclesiastical preferment to be elevated to the papal see as Pius\nII\u2014often called the first \u201chumanist pope\u201d. Yet, in\nhis most famous work of political thought, De ortu et auctoritate\nimperii Romani (On the Origin and Authority of the Roman\nEmpire; 1446), Piccolomini advanced a defense of a universalist,\nimperial and even absolutist ideal of government under the banner of\nthe Holy Roman Empire. As with many of the authors previously\nsurveyed, such a position would seem wholly incompatible with civic\nhumanism.\n\nPiccolomini\u2019s argument starts, but does not finish, with\nkingship. Kings were first authorized in the earliest times of human\nhistory in order to shield the rights of weaker men from injury by the\nstronger. This is a theme common to numerous republican civic\nhumanists, drawn from a position held by Cicero, who was an important\nsource for them. The king is regarded as the personification of\njustice. His moral character outshines that of his fellows, so he does\nnot require law as the foundation of his rule, since his judgments are\nso rooted in a sense of justice and equity that they enjoy the force\nof law. A conventional account of the breakdown of kingship would\ninvolve the declining morality of successive kings, leading to\ntyranny. By contrast, Piccolomini detects a quite different inherent\nweakness in political arrangements associated with kingship,\nregardless of the moral qualities of a particular royal incumbent.\n\nIn De ortu, he points out that the creation of a king was not\na unique or isolated event. Rather, throughout the world there are\nmany kings who rule over a plurality of territories. As these kingdoms\ndefined and expanded their geographical boundaries or spheres of\njurisdiction, they inevitably came into conflict. And since there was\nno means of arbitration amongst such coequal powers, the resolution of\ndisputes between them occurred by means of armed engagements. These\nensuing conflicts between royal powers and their peoples are directly\nthe function of an inescapable structural limitation endemic to\nlocalized or regional kingship per se. It is not morally\ncorrupt rulers alone who are held responsible for clashes over lands\nand rights. Instead, any king who is performing his duties properly\nwill, Piccolomini supposes, inevitably enter into contention with\nanother king and will be compelled to turn to warfare.\n\nConsequently, the political model of an independent network of\nkingships is incompatible with the very purpose which warranted the\ncreation of kings, namely, the maintenance of just and harmonious\nrelations among human beings. The decentralized distribution of royal\npower ultimately produces an effect which is exactly contrary to that\nintended. Empowered as the agent of social harmony, kingship proves to\nbe its enemy, confounding rather than reinforcing the justice which\nthe ruler is charged with upholding. Notice here how the problems of\nconflict and the absence of harmony, addressed by many civic\nhumanists, manifest themselves in Piccolomini\u2019s thought as well.\nHis solution, however, is quite different from his Florentine\ncolleagues. Since the particularity of royal regimes runs afoul of the\nordained end of political power, the attainment of justice, and the\norder that comes with it, can only be achieved by a universality of\npolitical rule, that is, a single world empire. In imperial government\nalone does political power finally attain a form consistent with the\naim of its original authorization. Once again, one may plausibly\nassert that civic humanist principles might move in a direction quite\ndivergent from republicanism (Lee 2018).\n3.4 Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n\nMachiavelli (1469\u20131527) is doubtless the best known of all the\nauthors discussed here on account of his Il principe\n(Prince; c. 1513\u20131514) and (to a lesser extent)\nDiscorsi (Discourses; c. 1514\u20131519). The\nformer is a somewhat notorious advice-book for rulers who wish to gain\nand hold power; the latter evaluates the strengths of a republican\nsystem of government. Machiavelli was deeply involved in governing the\nrepublic of Florence, serving in several important official\ncapacities, until a 1512 coup against the regime engineered by the\nMedici family cost him his position. Less often recognized is that he\nwrote prolifically\u2014poetry, plays, histories, military\nmanuals\u2014and left us with a large collection of correspondence\nand dispatches from his diplomatic activities (Nederman 2023).\nScholars from many viewpoints, judge Machiavelli to be the epitome of\ncivic humanist republicanism during the later Italian Renaissance\n(Najemy 1996). The academic literature on Machiavelli\u2019s thought\nis immense. Any serious attempt to summarize it is a fool\u2019s\nerrand.\n\nStated simply, Machiavelli encapsulates the multiple forms of civic\nhumanism that have been examined. On the one hand, the\nDiscorsi is said to epitomize the republican ideals of\nself-governance and active citizenship commonly associated with the\nessence of civic humanism. (As mentioned in the Introduction,\nMachiavelli is one of the primary historical figures to whom\ncontemporary republican philosophers look for ideas and inspiration.)\nOn the other hand, Il principe exemplifies the tendency of\nsome civic humanists who have been considered above to look toward\nmonarchic regimes as the preferable form of rule. A plethora of\nscholarly effort has been directed toward attempting to reconcile\nthese two evidently very contradictory positions. Some interpreters\nsuggest, for instance, that the Discorsi represents his\n\u201creal\u201d views, and that Il principe is a satire or\nan attempt to win back his job in the Florentine government or to\nreveal to his fellow citizens the \u201creal\u201d inner workings of\nprincely regimes. Others propose that Il principe reflects\nMachiavelli\u2019s true teachings and that the principles ascribed to\nthe Discorsi are little more than extensions of his earlier\ntract. And some simply assert that no accord is possible.\n\nIt should be obvious, then, that the characteristics of the civic\nhumanist propensities ascribed by scholars to Machiavelli may be\nunderstood in a vast number of ways. Given the diversity of\ninterpretations, it is perhaps of greater utility to identify a single\ncentral theme shared by Il principe and the Discorsi\nand various civic humanists already discussed. Specifically,\nMachiavelli, like prior Florentine humanists, confronted in his\nwritings the quarrels that arose from conflicts between contending\nsets of interests, whether classes or political entities. All of the\nauthors previously addressed praised their favored form of government\n(republic, monarchy, empire) on the grounds that it introduced harmony\nand peace between clashing groups.\n\nIn both of his works, Machiavelli acknowledges the existence within\nevery community of two inherently incompatible classes: the\ngrandi (nobles) and the popolo (masses). The nobles\nseek to dominate those beneath them; the masses desire only to be free\nfrom domination. He clearly believes that these two parties can never\nbe brought together in a peaceful fashion. Their interests are simply\nincommensurable. So, Machiavelli\u2019s dilemma is how to avoid the\nnobles and the masses from warring against one another. He provides\ntwo possibilities. In Il principe, he remarks that a prince\nwho wishes to maintain his power must curb the aspirations of the\nnobility, to the extent that a ruler may reasonably consider\ncold-blooded murder as one of his tools. The people, by contrast,\nshould be treated mildly. Indeed, Machiavelli insists that if a prince\nmust choose to side with one or the other class, he should always take\nup the cause of the masses. Why? First, because their numbers are so\nmuch greater than those of the nobles that they are bound to prevail.\nSecond, because the popolo are so distant from the machinery\nof government headed by the prince that they are unable to observe the\nsometimes vicious means by which he must rule. Third, because they,\nbeing uneducated, are easily led by appearances and are unable to\napprehend the truth that the prince seeks to conceal.\n\nThe Discorsi treats class conflict in an entirely different\nway, namely, as a positive or productive feature of a well-developed\nrepublican system. Machiavelli\u2019s epitome of an ideal republic is\nancient Rome, in which tumult was rife. According to him, by\npermitting rather than suppressing the collision between these two\nsets of interests, Rome succeeded in actualizing and maintaining the\nparamount value of liberty. In a republic of the Roman sort, the\nnobility (via the Senate) has the main responsibility for governing,\nbut the people check that power by means of countervailing offices\n(such as the tribunes) and popular dissent. The struggle between them\nactually generates the liberty of the whole, both in terms of\nself-government unbeholden to either external forces or to tyranny and\nby assuring that the people\u2019s desire not to be dominated is\nachieved.\n\nMachiavelli recognizes that he is adopting an unusual perspective,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. By\ncontrast, he insists that precisely those conflicts generated a\n\u201ccreative tension\u201d that was the source of Roman liberty.\nOther republican models (such as those adopted by Sparta or Venice)\nproduced weaker political systems, ones that are either stagnant or\nprone to decay when circumstances change. The ultimate sign of the\nunique greatness of the Roman Republic is its conquest of huge amounts\nof territory, as a result of the grandi and the\npopolo setting aside their ultimately interminable struggles\n(at least for a time) in order to cooperate in the subjugation and\nexploitation of vast lands. Class struggle is thus socialized and put\nto effective use. It has been suggested, and with good reason, that a\nsignal element of Machiavelli\u2019s political project was to promote\nFlorence as the new Rome that will impose its domination over the rest\nof Italy. It is perhaps not too great a stretch to call him a civic\nhumanist with imperialistic pretensions (H\u00f6rnqvist 2004).\n4. The Pre-history of Civic Humanism\n\nAs previously noted, Baron posited that the birth of civic humanism\noccurred precisely out of the 1402 crisis in Florence. This position\nhas been challenged on various historical grounds, most notably by\nSeigel (1966). One problem with Baron\u2019s claim stems from his\nevident lack of familiarity with the political philosophy of preceding\ncenturies. Long before the beginning of the quattrocento,\npolitical authors (some of Florentine origin) had undertaken the\ndefense of the republican system of government generally and of the\nRoman Republic in particular in terms redolent of civic humanism.\nWriting c. 1265, a Florentine civil servant exiled to France, Brunetto\nLatini (1993), argued for the superiority of republics (communes) over\nother types of constitution and also described in detail the\nmechanisms of republican governance. Around 1300, another Italian, the\nParis-educated scholastic philosopher Ptolemy of Lucca (1997),\ncomposed an extensive brief favoring the Roman Republic as the ideal\nform of government (Blythe 2009; but see also Yun 2008 and Nederman\nand Sullivan 2012). The size of the list of pro-republican political\ntheorists writing before 1402 could be multiplied many times over.\n\nWhy was Baron inattentive to pre-Renaissance European republicanism?\nThe answer may be traced to what civic humanism represented to him:\nmodernity, secularity, rationality; in sum, the \u201cglory\u201d of\nthe Renaissance in contrast with the benighted Middle Ages. Scholars\nhave long since realized that a dividing line drawn between medieval\nand early modern periods is wholly unwarranted (Nederman 2009). Just\nas civic humanism as the designation of an intellectual movement\nwithin the tradition of Western political theory proves to be quite\ncapacious, so its existence and development should be regarded as more\nfluid historically than has often been claimed.\n",
