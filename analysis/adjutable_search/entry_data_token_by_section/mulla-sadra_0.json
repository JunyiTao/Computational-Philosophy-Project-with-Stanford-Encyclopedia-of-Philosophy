    "main_text": "Life and works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nMulla Sadra was the sole child born into a courtly family in Shiraz,\nsouthern Iran, in around 979 AH/1571\u201372. A bright young man, his\ninterest in intellectual pursuits was indulged by his father, and he\nmoved first to Qazvin in 1000 AH/1591 and then to Isfahan in 1006\nAH/1597, successive capitals of the Safavid empire, to pursue his\nstudy of philosophy, theology, the prophetic tradition, and\nQur\u2019anic hermeneutics and exegesis. His teachers were the two\npre-eminent scholars of his age, Mir Muhammad Baqir Damad Astarabadi,\nthe grandson of the powerful jurist and statesman \u2018Ali Karaki,\nand Shaykh Baha\u2019 al-Din \u2018Amili known as Shaykh\nBaha\u2019i (d. 1030 AH/1620\u201321), who was the leading jurist in\nIsfahan during the reign of Shah Abbas I. With the former, he studied\nphilosophy and theology, in particular the Peripatetic works of\nAvicenna (d. 428 AH/1037) and his student Bahmanyar (d. 458 AH/1066),\nthe pseudo-Aristotelian Plotiniana Arabica (in particular the\nso-called Theology of Aristotle), and the Illuminationist\nworks of Suhrawardi (d. 586 AH/1191). With Shaykh Baha\u2019i, as was\nthe case with a number of other students, he studied the scriptural\nsciences of Qur\u2019anic exegesis and the traditions of the\nShi\u2018i Imams. Contrary to what Corbin and others have claimed\n(Corbin 1971: 58; Nasr 1977: 32), there seems to be no evidence that\nhe studied with another intriguing scholar from Astarabad and\nassociate of Mir Damad, Mir Findiriski (d. 1050 AH/1640\u201341), an\nitinerant scholar who spent much time studying Indian philosophies and\nreligions. Certainly the story recorded by some of the later\nbiographical dictionaries that claims that Mulla Sadra was advised by\nMir Findiriski to study with Mir Damad is apocryphal. We do not have a\nformal license (ijaza) from his teachers that has survived,\nwhich could attest to his study with them and to the content of the\ncurriculum; certainly, we know that both Mir Damad and Shaikh\nBaha\u2019i granted a number of these licenses and attestations of\nstudy to their students as compiled by Majlisi II (Mulla Muhammad\nBaqir Majlisi, known as \u2018Allama-yi Majlisi, 1036\u20131110\nAH/1627\u201399) in Bihar al-anwar [Seas of\nLights]. However, we have one very valuable source that records\nthe intimate relationship of his study and even spiritual discipleship\nin a literary-poetic collection of the early 17th century from Qazvin\nknown as the Jung-i Qazvin. This codex (which is in the National\nLibrary in Tehran) includes autograph notes of Mir Damad, Shaikh\nBaha\u2019i, and Mulla Sadra. Among these notes are short ijaza-like\nstatements for Mulla Sadra. Shaikh Baha\u2019i quoted some narrations\nof the Imams and wrote that he did so at the bequest of his\n\u201cillustrious and most excellent, intelligent and witty and pure\nson Sadra\u201d (Khaminihi 2000: 59). Similarly, in a note Mir Damad\nreferred to Sadra as his spiritual son (Khaminihi 2000: 56). The dual\ninfluence of his teachers can be gauged in his early notes that reveal\nan interest in Sufism, especially Sufi poetry and the law. These notes\nwere probably written in Shiraz in 1016 AH/1607\u20138. However,\ninterest in Sufism does not necessarily entail affiliation to a Sufi\norder, a practice which, in any case, was highly controversial in this\nperiod: the claim of the 19th-century Ni\u2018mat-Allahi Sufi\nMa\u2018sum-\u2018Ali-Shah that Mulla Sadra was a Nurbakhshi Sufi\ncannot be substantiated.\n\nCompleting his training and possibly prompted by the death of his\nfather in 1010 AH/1601\u20132, he returned to Shiraz to work and\nteach; but, failing to find an adequate patron and facing the\nopposition and criticism of a city that had forgotten the value of the\nstudy of philosophy, he retreated to Kahak, a small village outside\nthe holy city of Qom, to meditate upon his inquiries and initiate the\ncomposition of his main works, especially his philosophical and\ntheological summa, al-Hikma al-muta\u2018aliya fi-l-asfar\nal-\u2018aqliyya al-arba\u2018a (Transcendent wisdom of the\nfour journeys of the intellect), popularly known as al-Asfar\nal-arba\u2018a (The Four Journeys). His retreat\n(khalvat) lasted probably five years. He then began an\nitinerant life, teaching and writing in Qom, visiting and\ncorresponding with Mir Damad in Isfahan until the latter\u2019s death\nin 1040 AH/1631, and spending time at his family estates in Shiraz.\nManuscript evidence attests to his itinerant life until 1040\nAH/1630\u20131. His relationship with Mir Damad was particularly\nimportant: he began espousing his teacher\u2019s ideas until he\nchanged his views later in life, but Mir Damad remained his spiritual\nmaster. His devotion was expressed in the letters that they exchanged.\nIn a letter dated 1018 AH/1609\u201310 from Shiraz, Mulla Sadra\ndescribed Mir Damad as \u201cthe apportioner of grace to the hearts\nof the wise, the eleventh intellect, he who masters the theory and\npractice of the sciences, the lord (sayyid) of philosophers\nand the master of the jurists, the most noble of scholars, the\nciviliser of Islam\u201d (Khamenehi 2000: 109). In another letter\ndated 1037 AH/1627\u20138 probably from Qom, he complained of their\nseparation and expressed concern for the health of Mir Damad\ndescribing him as \u201cour master and lord (sayyid), may\nGod preserve his shadow over his separated disciples by preserving his\nnoble existence and his honour and the light of the illumination of\nhis light that enlightens the hearts of spiritual wayfarers\u201d\n(Khaminihi 2000: 113).\n\nHe trained a number of significant philosophers in the period in Qom,\nthe most important of whom were Muhsin Fayz-i Kashani (d. 1090\nAH/1680\u20131), who studied with him between 1030 AH/1620\u20131\nand 1038 AH/1628\u20139, as attested in Fayz\u2019s autobiographical\ntreatise Sharh-i Sadr, and \u2018Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji (known\nas Fayyaz-i Lahiji, d. 1072 AH/1661\u20132), both of whom became his\nsons-in-law. Other students included the philosophers Husayn\nTunikabuni (d. 1105 AH/1693\u20134) and Muhammad Riza Aqajani (d.\n1071 AH/1660\u20131). After his retreat to Qom, Mulla Sadra probably\nmarried in Shiraz. One modern source suggests that his wife was the\ndaughter of Mirza Zia al-Din Muhammad Razi, which would mean that his\nwife and the mother of Fayz were sisters, suggesting a relationship\nthat predates the teacher and student one. As an affluent man, Mulla\nSadra had five children who survived and a large household, including\nretainers and students. His first-born Umm Kulsum was born in 1019\nAH/1610\u20131 and later married his student Fayyaz-i Lahiji in Qom.\nAnother daughter Zubayda was born in 1024 AH/1615 in Qom and later\nmarried Fayz-i Kashani. His third daughter Ma\u2018suma was born in\nQom in 1033 AH/1623\u20134 and later married another student, Qutb\nal-Din Muhammad Nayrizi, about whom nothing is recorded. Mulla Sadra\nalso had three sons who became scholars in their own right: Ibrahim,\nwho was born in Qom in 1021 AH/1612\u20133, became a prominent\ntheologian at court, and died in Isfahan in 1071 AH/1660\u20131:\nNizam al-Din Ahmad, who was born in Kashan in 1031 AH/1621\u20132 and\ndied in Shiraz in 1074 AH/1664; and his youngest son Muhammad Riza,\nwho was probably born in Qom but about whom we do not have any\nbiographical information.\n\nIn 1040 AH/1630\u20131, Mulla Sadra moved permanently to his hometown\nat the request of (possibly his former student) Imamquli Khan (d. 1042\nAH/1633), the extremely powerful governor-general\n(beglerbegi) of Sadra\u2019s home province Fars and son of\nthe celebrated Georgian military commander Allahvirdi Khan. The\nMadrasa-yi Khan seminary, founded by Imamquli\u2019s father and\ncompleted in 1024 AH/1615, had been established with an express\npurpose of teaching philosophy and science. Mulla Sadra was the clear\nchoice for teaching there, and it is possible that he had begun his\nassociation from the inception of the institution. He completed his\nmajor work, the Four Journeys (al-Asfar\nal-arba\u2018a) in Shiraz in 1038 AH/1628 and in the same year\nthe English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert described the Madrasa:\n\u201cand [indeed] Shyraz has a colledge wherein is read Philosophy,\nAstrology, Physick, Chemistry and the Mathematicks; so as \u2018tis\nthe more famoused through Persia\u201d (Herbert, Some Years\nTravel, London, 1634, p. 129). This late period of his life was\nproductive, and he was much respected as a teacher in his hometown.\nAfter an illustrious and prolific career, he died in Basra on his way\nto his seventh pilgrimage to Mecca. The traditional date given for his\ndeath is 1050 AH/1640\u20131. However, there is no clear evidence in\nsupport of this date. His grandson Muhammad \u2018Alam al-Huda, the\nson of Fayz-i Kashani, reported that his grandfather died in Basra in\n1045 AH/1635\u20136 and was buried in Najaf in the precinct of the\nshrine of the first Shi\u2018i Imam \u2018Ali b. Abi Talib\n(Khaminihi 2000: 414). This is attested in two paratexts of his works,\nand seems to be corroborated by the fact that the date of completion\nfor his last works, including those left incomplete, is 1044\nAH/1635.\n",
