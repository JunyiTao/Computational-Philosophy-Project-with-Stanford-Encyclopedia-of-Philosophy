(In the terminology of Burgess and\nRosen 1997, this is the distinction between a\n\u201chermeneutic\u201d construal of modal fictionalism and a\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d construal of modal fictionalism). If the\ntheory is that in fact we take possible worlds to be no more than\nconvenient fictions, and, in the case of strong modal fictionalism,\nthat facts about the content and nature of the fiction of possible\nworlds explain and/or provide the basis of the analysis of our modal\nlocutions, then the theory is descriptive. This sociological claim\nthat most philosophers who talk about possible worlds take this talk\nto be analogous to talk of e.g., ideal gases is a dubious one: my own\nimpression is that modal fictionalism is a minority view amongst those\nphilosophers who work extensively on the philosophy of possible worlds\nand its applications, though perhaps fictionalism might be the\nmajority view when all who have opinions on possible worlds are taken\ninto account.\n\nIn any case, fictionalism about possible worlds might be important\neven if the descriptive version is incorrect. A normative claim to the\neffect that talk of possible worlds ought to be interpreted\nas merely fictional discourse, or the corresponding strong\nfictionalist claim that modal statements ought to be\nreinterpreted so as to be explained or analysed as statements about\nthe content of the fiction of possible worlds, might be found\nattractive even if it were conceded that most people who employed the\ndiscourse were not talking fictively, or that the actual commitments\nof the folk and most philosophers who employ everyday modal idiom are\nto be cashed out in some other way (e.g., as implicit commitment to\nsome false theory, perhaps one which took modal statements to have\ntruth conditions in terms of an objective modal reality). \n\nThe two questions, of whether the fictionalist theory is supposed to\ndescribe our current practice, and whether it is supposed to describe\na practice we should adopt instead of realism, are independent. Two\npeople could agree that normal usage of possible-worlds talk is not\nintended literally, but disagree about whether we should accept the\nliteral existence of possible worlds (that is, they could be\ndescriptive fictionalists while disagreeing about the normative\nquestion), and likewise two people could be normative fictionalists,\nand claim that we should take ordinary possible worlds talk as being\nonly fictionally true or appropriate, while disagreeing about whether\nin fact current usage reflects this fictionalism or instead reveals\nnon-fictionalist commitments among the users of the vocabulary. (This\nindependence may be overlooked if we employ Burgess and Rosen\u2019s\nvocabulary, which suggests that fictionalists face a binary choice of\na \u201chermeneutic\u201d fictionalist approach or a\n\u201crevisionary\u201d approach.) \n\nUnfortunately, modal fictionalists have often not been explicit about\nwhether their theory is to be an analysis of the possible-worlds talk\nand perhaps modal discourse which is actually employed, or a normative\nsuggestion about how we might move to a superior theory. It is to be\nhoped that those seeking to provide a fully worked out modal\nfictionalist position would make more explicit the status of their\nproposal. \n",
