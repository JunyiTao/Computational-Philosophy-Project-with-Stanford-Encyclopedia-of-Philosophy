    "main_text": "Political Authority as Grounded in Associative Obligations || Do Communities of Principle Satisfy the Four Conditions of Genuine Association?\n6.1 Do Communities of Principle Satisfy the Four Conditions of Genuine Association?\n\n\nBut surely, the satisfaction of some of the conditions must depend\non exactly what principles are in the community. Principles that are\nfocused on liberty and that avoid any reference to well being, such as\nKant would require of political principles, presumably would not\nsatisfy the last two conditions. Principles that are not egalitarian,\nsuch as those that governed the United States during the first century\nof its existence and probably longer, would not satisfy the last\ncondition. So it is not clear that being a community of principle is a\nsufficient condition for satisfying the four conditions.\n\n\nIt is also not obvious that it is necessary that a community be a\ncommunity of principle in order for it to satisfy the four conditions\nin Dworkin's sense. For one can imagine a community in which\nindividuals are committed to democratic resolution of the disagreements\non justice that arise and thereby are committed to the equal importance\nof the well being of each member. They attempt to advance opposing\nprinciples of justice and conceptions of the common good and make\ncompromises when they cannot secure sufficient majorities for these.\nIndeed, this seems much closer to the character of modern democracies\nthan Dworkin's view. Such a society would satisfy the four conditions\nbut it is not clear that it is a community of principle.\n\n\nDworkin's idea that modern political societies can be seen as\ncommunities of principle is grounded in his emphasis on judicial\ninstitutions as the core institutions of modern political societies and\nhis account of legal interpretation. His view is that judges interpret\nthe law by creating a coherent account of as much of the black letter\nlaw as possible and by interpreting that black letter law in terms of\nprinciples that make the law be the best that it can be. Hence, judges\naim at producing a coherent account of the law overall by grounding it\nin the best basic moral principles that it can be grounded in. From\nthis he thinks of modern societies as being concerned to elaborate\ncommon principles by which the society can be guided.\n\n\nBut his emphasis on judicial decision making seems excessive. In the\ndemocratic legislative process, citizens often do not see themselves as\nbeing guided by common principles. They see themselves as disagreeing\nwith each other about what principles the society ought to be guided\nby. They also often see themselves as disagreeing with and trying to\nchange the principles they see embodied in the law. They may look at\nthe legislation in their community as negotiated compromises between\ndifferent principles and not as deriving from a common set of\nprinciples. And yet they do see themselves as members of a common\ndemocratic community. This aspect of democratic rivalry does not seem\nto be very well accommodated by Dworkin's view of modern societies as\ncommunities of principle.\n",
