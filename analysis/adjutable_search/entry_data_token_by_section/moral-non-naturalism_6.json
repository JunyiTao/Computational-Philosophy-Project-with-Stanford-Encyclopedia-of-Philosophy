    "main_text": "Explaining Supervenience\n7. Methodology\n\n\nThe debate over non-naturalism is difficult to resolve in part\nbecause the issues often hinge on fundamentally different\nmethodological starting points. Advocates of non-naturalism tend to be\nless concerned with finding a place for value and obligation in the\nworld as revealed by science and more interested in taking our common\nsense conception of morality as given and seeing what it implicitly\npresupposes. Non-naturalism\u2019s opponents, by contrast, put a great deal\nof weight on explaining our moral practices in a way that fits well\nwith a properly scientific view of the world and are happy to reject\nthe presuppositions of common sense if they conflict with that\nconception. So non-naturalists tend to be more interested than their\nopponents in respecting our pre-theoretical intuitions about morality\nand moral judgement. Hence non-naturalists often give substantial\nweight to the intuitive force of the Open Question Argument. They also\nare less willing to revise common-sense moral beliefs about particular\ncases for the sake of aligning those beliefs with some ambitious\nnaturalistic moral theory. It is no coincidence that so-called moral\nparticularists, who deny that morality can adequately be captured by\nany set of principles linking natural features to moral ones, tend to\nfavor some form of non-naturalism. Naturalists, by contrast, are more\nlikely to emphasize the importance of rejecting beliefs that fit poorly\nwith our best scientific account of reality; if common sense commits us\nto properties that do not fit well into that account then so much the\nworse for common sense. Given these deep methodological differences,\nthe only apparent way avoid philosophical stalemate would be to develop\nan argument for one of the two positions whose plausibility does not\ndepend on the controversial methodological assumptions associated with\nthat position. The best candidate for such an argument considered here\nmight well be the argument that non-naturalists cannot explain\nsupervenience. For the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral\nseems to fall out of common sense rather than out of our scientific\nworld-view. Since the methodology associated with non-naturalism itself\nputs great weight on common sense, the argument from supervenience\nseems like a promising one. At the very least, the argument from\nsupervenience seems uniquely well situated to undermine non-naturalism\nwithout begging any central methodological questions.\n",
