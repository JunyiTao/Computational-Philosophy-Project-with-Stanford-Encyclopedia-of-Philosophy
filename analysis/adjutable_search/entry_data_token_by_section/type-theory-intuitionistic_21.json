    "main_text": "Meaning Explanations\n5. Meaning Explanations\nThe consistency of intuitionistic type theory relative to set\ntheory can be proved by model constructions. Perhaps the simplest\nmethod is an interpretation whereby each type-theoretic concept is\ngiven its corresponding set-theoretic meaning, as outlined\nin \n section 2.3. For example the type of functions \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nis interpreted as the set of all functions in the set-theoretic sense\nbetween the set denoted by \\(A\\) and the set denoted by \\(B\\). To\ninterpret \\(\\U\\) we need a set-theoretic universe which is closed under\nall (set-theoretic analogues of) the type constructors. Such a\nuniverse can be proved to exist if we assume the existence of an\ninaccessible cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) and interpret \\(\\U\\) by \\(V_\\kappa\\)\nin the cumulative hierarchy.\nAlternatives are realizability models, and for intensional type\ntheory, a model of terms in normal forms. The latter can also be used\nfor proving decidability of the judgments of the theory.\nMathematical models only prove consistency relative to classical\nset theory (or whatever other meta-theory we are using). Is it\npossible to be convinced about the consistency of the theory in a more\ndirect way, so called simple minded consistency\n(Martin-L\u00f6f 1984)? In fact, is there a way to explain what\nit means for a judgment to be correct in a\ndirect pre-mathematical way? And given that we know what the\njudgments mean can we then be convinced that the inference rules of\nthe theory are valid? An answer to this problem was proposed by\nMartin-L\u00f6f in 1979 in the paper \u201cConstructive Mathematics\nand Computer Programming\u201d (Martin-L\u00f6f 1982) and elaborated\nlater on in numerous lectures and notes, see for example,\nMartin-L\u00f6f (1984, 1987). These meaning explanations for\nintuitionistic type theory are also referred to as the direct\nsemantics, intuitive semantics, informal\nsemantics, standard semantics, or\nthe syntactico-semantical approach to meaning theory.\nThis meaning theory follows the Wittgensteinian meaning-as-use\ntradition. The meaning is based on rules for building objects\n(introduction rules) of types and computation rules (elimination\nrules) for computing with these objects. A difference from much of the\nWittgensteinian tradition is that also higher order types like \\(\\N\n\\rightarrow \\N\\) are given meaning using rules.\nTo explain the meaning of a judgment we must first know how the\nterms in the judgment are computed to canonical form. Then the\nformation rules explain how correct canonical types are built and the\nintroduction rules explain how correct canonical objects of such\ncanonical types are built. We quote (Martin-L\u00f6f 1982):\n\nA canonical type \\(A\\) is defined by prescribing how a canonical\nobject of type \\(A\\) is formed as well as how two equal canonical\nobjects of type \\(A\\) are formed. There is no limitation on this\nprescription except that the relation of equality which it defines\nbetween canonical objects of type \\(A\\) must be reflexive, symmetric\nand transitive.\n \nIn other words, a canonical type is equipped with an equivalence\nrelation on the canonical objects. Below we shall give a simplified\nform of the meaning explanations, where this equivalence relation is\nextensional identity of objects.\nIn spite of the pre-mathematical nature of this meaning\ntheory, its technical aspects can be captured as a mathematical model\nconstruction similar to Kleene\u2019s realizability interpretation\nof intuitionistic logic, see the next section. The realizers here are\nthe terms of type theory rather than the number realizers used by\nKleene.\n",
