    "main_text": "The background to Kant\u2019s views in the Critique || Kant\u2019s understanding of representation\n2.2 Kant\u2019s understanding of representation\n\nIn a famous passage in the first Critique, Kant helpfully\ndiscusses his notion of representation (A320/B376\u201377):\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nKant regards an intuition as a conscious, objective\nrepresentation\u2014this is strictly distinct from sensation, which\nhe regards not as a representation of an object, property, event,\netc., but merely as a state of the subject. Whereas sensations do not\nrepresent anything distinct from the sensing subject (including\nperhaps the state of the subject\u2019s body), intuitions are\nobjective\n representations.[2]\n Recent scholarship emphasizes the importance of his distinction\nbetween sensation and intuition (Allais 2015, 145\u201347, 154,\n159\u201360).\n\nThe distinction between sensation and intuition in Kant\u2019s\nthinking is fundamental to his overarching conception of space and\ntime. This is the case for several reasons, not least because one\nshould avoid thinking that Kant takes us to have a sensation of space;\nwe have, rather, an intuition of it (see Carson 1997). The distinction\nhas many facets, but the basic idea is as follows. Sensations are\nsubjective in the sense that they do not represent objects, they are\nmodifications of the subject. A good example of a sensation would be\nan itch that I feel. Of course, an itch might be caused (e.g.) by some\nflour that fell on my nose while baking cookies, but the itch does not\nrepresent the flour, or indeed anything outside myself; the itch is\nsimply what I feel. If we felt only sensations, we would lack\nrepresentations of things other than ourselves, even if such things\ncaused or helped to cause our sensations. Perhaps sensations would\nenable us to avoid injury or pain--one might, say, jump back when\nfeeling heat from a fire. But without intuition, we would lack spatial\nawareness: that is, we would lack an awareness of things in spatial\nlocations around us. In order to represent things other than\nourselves, we require intutition, which Kant regards as a singular,\nimmediate, objective representation (where sensations are merely\nsubjective, as we have seen). In what sense is intuition an objective\nrepresentation that is singular and immediate? That complex idea\nmeans, for starters, that intuition represents particulars, i.e.,\nthings with some spatial location vis-\u00e0-vis me and also other\nthings. So when I feel an itch, I have a sensation; when I see the\npile of flour in front of me next to the bowl on my counter, I have an\nintuition, a representation of something in space with a location\nrelative to me and to other things. However, although intuition\ncan represent flour on the counter next to the bowl, it does not\nrepresent it as flour. For that, one would require a\n concept.[3]\n\n\nAs is well known, the distinction between concepts and intuition is\nalso fundamental to Kant\u2019s thought. Whereas intuitions are\nsingular, immediate representations, concepts are general, mediate\nones (Engstrom 2006). Each item represents properties, objects, or\nstates of affairs, but they do so distinctly. Unfortunately, there is\nno consensus on the right way to understand this\n idea.[4]But\n roughly speaking, intuition represents some X\u2014where\nX might be an object, a property, or perhaps even an\nevent\u2014as one represents X in perception. Thus it\nrepresents X as, for instance, that\n there.[5]In\n contrast, a concept represents X\u2014where, again,\nX might be a property, an object, or perhaps even an\nevent\u2014by placing X within one or more classes. Suppose\nthat I want to represent my desk, at which I am sitting right now. To\nrepresent my desk in intuition is to represent it as something I point\nto, as that there. This does not indicate, of course, that\nthis is a desk, my desk, a piece of furniture, made of wood, etc., but\nit does pick out a particular, something with a spatial location\nrelative to me and to other things (like the carpet on the floor). It\ndoes so immediately at least in the sense that it makes use\nof no other representation. To represent my desk with a concept is to\nrepresent it as a desk, or as a piece of furniture,\nor as a wooden thing, etc. From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nthis is to represent my desk mediately at least in the sense\nthat the concept, <desk>, represents an object through other\nconcepts, such as\n <furniture>.[6]\n It is also important to remember that in representing my desk through\nintuition, i.e., in representing it as a thing with some spatial\nlocation but not yet qua desk, I am perceiving the\ndesk but not judging it to be a desk (or anything else). In\norder to judge that there is a desk in front of me, or\nindeed, in order to judge that there is something in front of me, I\nrequire concepts and the complex machinery discussed in the famous\nTranscendental Deduction, a key section of the Critique that\narrives after the arguments of the Transcendental Aesthetic have been\npresented. Intuition alone is akin to perception--it plays a role in\njudgment, but it is not itself akin to \njudgment.[7]\n\nOne of Kant\u2019s surprising ideas is that each type of objective\nrepresentation, intuition and concept, can be either empirical or\na priori. The idea that some concepts are not empirical may\nnot be surprising because of the famous early modern\ntradition concerning innate ideas. Of course, Kant\u2019s\nconception of the origin of such concepts\u2014outlined in\nwhat he calls the \u201cmetaphysical deduction\u201d (B159,\nB377)\u2014contains surprises because he does not embrace innate\nideas (Longuenesse 1998). But leaving that complication aside, it is\nsurely very surprising to hear that intuition, which in some regards\nis akin to perception (Parsons 1992, 65\u201366; Allais 2015,\n147ff), can also be empirical or a priori in\ncharacter. Here it helps to recall that Kant distinguishes sensation\nfrom intuition. There remains a question, however, of how we are to\nunderstand the very idea that we can have pure\u2014or a\npriori, i.e., non-empirical\u2014intuition at all. This idea\ncomprises a central piece of Kant\u2019s views on space and time, for\nhe famously contends that space and time are nothing but forms of\nintuition, a view connected to the claim in the Transcendental\nAesthetic that we have pure intuitions of space and of time. This\nmeans, as we have seen, that we have non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representations of space and of time. One goal of this entry\nis to clarify this idea. It is not a stretch to contend that it\nrepresents one of Kant\u2019s most distinctive contributions to\nmodern philosophy. Characteristically, it is profoundly difficult to\ngrasp.\n",
