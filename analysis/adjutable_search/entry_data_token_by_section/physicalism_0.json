    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Terminology\n1.1 Terminology\n\nPhysicalism is sometimes known as \u2018materialism\u2019. Indeed,\non one strand to contemporary usage, the terms\n\u2018physicalism\u2019 and \u2018materialism\u2019 are\ninterchangeable. But the two terms have very different histories. The\nword \u2018materialism\u2019 appears in English towards the end of\nthe 17th century, but the word \u2018physicalism\u2019 was\nintroduced into philosophy only in the 1930s by\n Otto Neurath\n (1931) and\n Rudolf Carnap\n (1959/1932), both of whom were key members of the Vienna Circle, a\ngroup of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians active in Vienna\nprior to World War II. While it is not clear that Neurath and Carnap\nunderstood physicalism in the same way, one thesis often attributed to\nthem (e.g. in Hempel 1949) is the linguistic thesis that every\nstatement is synonymous with (i.e. is equivalent in meaning with) some\nphysical statement. But materialism as traditionally construed is not\na linguistic thesis at all; rather it is a metaphysical thesis in the\nsense that it tells us about the nature of the world. At least for the\npositivists, therefore, there was a clear reason for distinguishing\nphysicalism (a linguistic thesis) from materialism (a metaphysical\nthesis). Moreover, this reason was compounded by the fact that,\naccording to official positivist doctrine, metaphysics is nonsense.\nSince the 1930s, however, the positivist philosophy that under-girded\nthis distinction has for the most part been rejected\u2014for\nexample, physicalism is not a linguistic thesis for contemporary\nphilosophers\u2014and this is one reason why the words\n\u2018materialism\u2019 and \u2018physicalism\u2019 are now often\ninterpreted as interchangeable. \n\nSome philosophers suggest that \u2018physicalism\u2019 is distinct\nfrom \u2018materialism\u2019 for a reason quite unrelated to the one\nemphasized by Neurath and Carnap. As the name suggests, materialists\nhistorically held that everything was matter \u2014 where matter was\nconceived as \u201can inert, senseless substance, in which extension,\nfigure, and motion do actually subsist\u201d (Berkeley, Principles of\nHuman Knowledge, par. 9). But physics itself has shown that not\neverything is matter in this sense; for example, forces such as\ngravity are physical but it is not clear that they are material in the\ntraditional sense (Lange 1865, Dijksterhuis 1961, Yolton 1983). So it\nis tempting to use \u2018physicalism\u2019 to distance oneself from\nwhat seems a historically important but no longer scientifically\nrelevant thesis of materialism, and related to this, to emphasize a\nconnection to physics and the physical sciences. However, while\nphysicalism is certainly unusual among metaphysical doctrines in being\nassociated with a commitment both to the sciences and to a particular\nbranch of science, namely physics, it is not clear that this is a good\nreason for calling it \u2018physicalism\u2019 rather than\n\u2018materialism.\u2019 For one thing, many contemporary\nphysicalists do in fact use the word \u2018materialism\u2019 to\ndescribe their doctrine (e.g. Smart 1963). Moreover, while\n\u2018physicalism\u2019 is no doubt related to \u2018physics\u2019\nit is also related to \u2018physical object\u2019 and this in turn\nis very closely connected with \u2018material object\u2019, and via\nthat, with \u2018matter.\u2019 \n\nIn this entry, I will adopt the policy of using both terms\ninterchangeably, though I will typically refer to the thesis we will\ndiscuss as \u2018physicalism\u2019. It is important to note, though,\nthat physicalism (aka materialism) is often associated with a number\nof further doctrines distinct from the one we will focus on; for a\ndiscussion of some of these, see the supplement on:\n\nPhysicalism and Associated Doctrines\n\n",
