    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nOne of the most vigorous philosophical debates of the century broke\nout among cosmologists during the 1930s and 1940s. At the peak of the\ndebate, 1936\u201337, many of the most prominent scientists in\nBritain, as well as several leading philosophers of science, had\ngotten themselves publicly involved. Their arguments, attacks and\nrebuttals were chronicled in many of the leading scientific journals,\nincluding a special edition of the foremost general scientific\njournal, Nature, devoted entirely to philosophical arguments\nand counter-arguments.\n\nMethodology was the central issue of the debate, although metaphysical\nquestions also arose, particularly those concerning the actual reality\nof certain structures and forces imputed to the Universe by the new\ncosmological theories and observations. But in the end, methodology\nwas the real goad spurring on most of the participants.\n\nAt bottom, there were just two opposing positions in the debate, each\nof which comprised a two-point stance. On one side were those\nscientists who had their roots mostly in the experimental side of\nnatural science. To them, there was one and only one legitimate method\nfor science. Theory construction, they believed, involved two\nclosely-linked steps. First, one began from the empirical\nobservations, that is, from measurements, manipulations,\nexperiments, whose results were evident to the human senses; this is\nclassic empiricist epistemology. Observational results would\nthen suggest possible hypotheses to examine via further empirical\ntesting. When enough data concerning the hypothesis had been gathered,\nlogical generalization could be carried out, thereby\nproducing a theory; this is classic inductivist logic.\n\nOpposing these inductive-empiricist scientists were those whose roots\nwere mostly in the theoretical side of natural science, most\nespecially mathematical physics. To them, there was another, more\nlogically sound, method to construct theories. First,\nhypotheses could be generated in any fashion, although most\nbelieved that imagining hypotheses which were based upon very general,\nvery reasonable concepts\u2014that the Universe\u2019s physical\nprocesses had simple mathematical descriptions, for example\u2014was\nthe best place to begin; this is classic rationalist\nepistemology. Once the hypothesis had been generated, strict\nanalytical reasoning could be used to make predictions about\nobservations; this is classic deductivist logic. Scientists\nwho held this view came to be called\nhypothetico-deductivists; their views about both hypothesis\ngeneration and deductive predictions were each strongly opposed by the\ninductive-empiricists.\n\nPart of the controversy may be laid to the fact that cosmology was a\nnew science, and disputes about methodology in new sciences are not\nrare in the history of the sciences. What is rare about this case,\nhowever, is the vigor, sometimes even bitterness, with which the\nphilosophical controversy was waged. Another reason for the\ncontroversy lies in the fact that cosmology is a data-poor science:\nobservations are hard-won and rare, and they frequently must be run\nthrough elaborate theoretical manipulations and corrections in order\nto make sense at all. With a paucity of data results, scientists must\nrely upon philosophical argument to undergird their views about how\nthe scientific work should be done.\n\nOne final feature of the debate must be noted. The participants are\nalmost universally scientists, and not philosophers. Yet this does not\nmuch affect the level of philosophical thinking going on; these\nscientists knew their philosophy well, and they wielded\nphilosophy\u2019s weapons and defenses with great skill. In the end,\ntheir debate shaped cosmology into the science we know today.\n\nIt will be useful to look briefly at the history of cosmology leading\nup to the debate.\n2. The Lead-up to the Debate\n\nSince about 1700 theories about the nature and structure of the\nUniverse were derived from Newtonian theory, most especially his\ntheory of gravitation, which was used to account for the behavior of\nheavenly bodies and their systems. Newton\u2019s theory hypothesized\na force\u2014gravitation\u2014acting upon material bodies, free to\nmove over time within the passive, inert \u2018container\u2019 of\nthree-dimensional space. Bodies, paths, and space itself exemplified\nthe classical geometry of Euclid. All these features changed with the\npublication of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity,\n1915\u201317.\n2.1 Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s intended his theory to replace Newton\u2019s theory\nof gravitation completely. In Einstein\u2019s view, gravity was not a\nforce existing independently of the spatial \u2018container\u2019;\nrather, gravitation arises as a curvature of the space (and time,\nwhich is necessarily connected to space in the new theory), which\nmeans that geometry and gravity and astronomical behavior are all\nintimately connected. For example, near the sun the geometrical\nstructure, the curvature, of spacetime changes radically, which\nexpresses itself as an increasing velocity of incoming orbiting bodies\nsuch as comets or satellites. One immediate, and to some, puzzling,\nconsequence of Einstein\u2019s theory is that the geometry of the\nUniverse is no longer taken to be Euclidean. Although there are\nseveral different candidates for the actual geometry of space, it was\nnot known which is correct.\n\nIt was not recognized at first that the General Theory of Relativity\ncould be applied to the Universe as a single, whole, individual\nobject, thereby producing a new cosmological theory, one completely\ndifferent from its predecessors. Although the mathematics involved are\nextremely difficult, two solutions, one by Einstein himself, the other\nby the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter, were produced in just a\nshort time in 1917. Unfortunately, the universes predicted by the two\nsolutions were extreme: Einstein\u2019s universe would be densely\npacked with matter, whereas de Sitter\u2019s would be essentially\nempty.\n\nObviously, the universe as observed by astronomers did not conform at\nall to the description provided by either solution, a fact many found\ntroubling. Moreover, no additional solutions were forthcoming (even\nthough both Friedmann and LeMa\u00eetre had developed alternatives,\nthey remained unknown and unnoticed). For nearly twelve years, the new\ncosmology appeared to be going nowhere. Then Hubble at\nCalifornia\u2019s Mt. Palomar made public his astonishing\nobservations of a cosmic Doppler shift, a shift toward the red in the\ncolor of light coming from the most distant star systems.\n2.2 Hubble\u2019s Expanding Universe\n\nMost cosmologists\u2014with the interesting exception of Hubble\nhimself\u2014came to the immediate conclusion that the red shift\ncould only mean that the universe was expanding. Immediately the\nrelativity theorists were able to interpret the expansion as a\ncontinuous change in the geometry of spacetime, which was thoroughly\naccounted for by the General Theory of Relativity. After over a decade\nof stagnation in face of the meager choice between just two models of\nthe cosmos, Hubble\u2019s observations spurred theorists on to the\nconstruction of a melange of new models, each vying in competition\nwith the other.\n\nIn the end,  it was the Belgian astronomer Georges\nLeMa\u00eetre\u2019s theory of an expanding, three-stage universe\nthat came to be accepted. LeMa\u00eetre\u2019s model was publicly\nproclaimed as appropriate and generally correct by de Sitter at the\nend of a special session of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, 31 Oct 1931. Modern scientific cosmology had\nbeen officially born; because of its birth within the context of\nEinstein\u2019s theory of relativity, the new cosmology became\nquickly and broadly known as Relativistic Cosmology. The\nmodel of this cosmology is most famously that of the blowing up of a\nballoon painted with dots to represent galaxies. Over time, the radius\nof the model\u2019s spherical space (the balloon) increases, thereby\ndecreasing the curvature of the space (the balloon\u2019s skin), and\nincreasing the distance between the dots.\n\nAlthough cosmologists came from Europe and America as well as Britain,\nmost of the work in theoretical cosmology took place in London,\nCambridge and Oxford. Americans Hubble, Tolman and Robertson did their\nwork at CalTech in Pasadena, but were frequently in England; and most\nof the European and British workers cycled through Pasadena at one\ntime or another. De Sitter, from Holland, and LeMa\u00eetre, from\nBelgium, spent important periods in England, as did various of the\nGerman workers. Thus, even though cosmology was done throughout the\nWestern world, its major concentrating point was England; our focus in\nwhat follows will be the same.\n3. Cosmology and its philosophy\n\nBecause it represented such a radical departure from previous\nscientific thinking about the Universe, relativistic cosmology needed\nto work out its philosophical underpinnings, most especially in regard\nto its methodology. \u2018How is this new science to be\nconducted?\u2019 was thus a compelling question. But method, of\ncourse, is always linked to metaphysics and epistemology. A full-blown\nphilosophical discussion was evidently required. It came soon enough:\nwithin a span of less than a year, a vigorous debate between two\nphilosophically opposed camps developed. The debate required nearly\ntwo decades to reach its full resolution. But, with the resolution,\ncosmology had philosophically certified its methodology within the\ncontext of a consensus metaphysics and epistemology. Before going into\nthe details of the debate, however, several general points should be\nnoted. Let us turn to the details of the origin of the debate.\n3.1 Relativistic Cosmology: the majority philosophy\n\nTo begin with, the cosmological thinking of the majority of\nscientists\u2014including Eddington, de Sitter, Robertson, Tolman,\nand their colleagues\u2014had betrayed a relatively unexamined, and\napparently uncontroversial cluster of philosophical perspectives: on\nthe metaphysical side they held a modest sort of explanatory\nrealism\u2014if an accepted theory referred to entity\nx, then x was acceptable as a genuinely, physically\nreal object; to this metaphysical stance was coupled a methodology\nexhibiting a classic sort of inductive\nempiricism\u2014scientific knowledge consisted of\ngeneralizations built up from individual empirical observations. But\nthis cluster of views did not go long unchallenged. In early July\n1932, just nine months after relativistic cosmology became the\nconsensus during the British Association meeting, Oxford\nastrophysicist E. A. Milne published a short article in\nNature which directly attacked the current philosophical\ntenets, proposing their replacement by a new cluster of views, one as\nradical as the new science it purported to undergird.\n3.2 Milne\u2019s Philosophical Challenge\n\nMilne\u2019s metaphysical views were based in positivism, most\nespecially in operationalism: only those objects whose\nproperties could be directly revealed by some observational procedure,\nor operation, were to be counted among the real. Thus, for Milne,\nreality did not contain the usual relativistic cosmology referents\n\u201ccurved space\u201d, \u201cexpanding space\u201d or even\n\u201cfour-dimensional spacetime\u201d, simply because none of these\nentities were operationalizable. Milne held that \u2018what you see\nis what you get\u2019; since \u201ccurved space\u201d of various\ngeometries couldn\u2019t be observed, space was just as it\nlooked\u2014Euclidean. In the same way, the expanding of the Universe\nwas a genuine expanding\u2014each galaxy was retreating from each\nother\u2014not just a change in the geometry of the curvature, as it\nwas for the relativists. Moreover, in place of relativistic\ncosmology\u2019s inductive empiricism, Milne opted for a\nhypothetico-deductive rationalism. Cosmologists, Milne\nbelieved, were bound to dream up any and all possible models of a\nuniverse, and then deduce what, if any, observable consequences\nfollowed from their hypotheses. Hypothesizing could be based upon just\nabout anything, although Milne believed that certain very general\nrational principles derived from aesthetic beliefs about universal\norder and regularity would be the most fruitful. His\n\u2018cosmological principle\u2019, namely, that every\ncosmologist in the universe should look out upon the same cosmos, was\nthe prime example of such thinking. Later, Bondi would found\nSteady-state Cosmology on an even more general version of\nMilne\u2019s principle, which he called the \u2018perfect\ncosmological principle.\u2019\n3.3 Kinematic Relativity\u2014an alternative cosmology\n\nMilne\u2019s philosophy of cosmology came with a closely associated\ncosmological model, kinematic relativity, so-called because\nof its tight links to the kinematics of Einstein\u2019s Special\nTheory of Relativity. Kinematics, in Einstein\u2019s Special Theory,\nis especially concerned with observers trying to make measurements of\nthe behavior of objects moving in systems relative to themselves.\nAccording to Milne\u2019s understanding, these measurements could\nonly be made by the observers signalling among themselves using light\nor other electromagnetic radiation, using clocks to time the signals.\nIn the end, all measurement\u2014even space and\nvelocity\u2014reduced to timing the signals as they went from one\nobserver to another. This idea of measurement represented a\nrevolutionary simplification of previous ideas, and held philosophical\ninterest for that reason alone. There were practical consequences as\nwell. As Bondi later remarked, \u201cMilne\u2019s idea led\nstraightaway to the radar speed gun!\u201d\n\nMilne\u2019s kinematic relativity and its underlying philosophy both\nimmediately brought careful scrutiny, not to mention controversy.\n4. The Great Cosmological Debate Begins: 1933\u20131934\n\nEddington was the first to attack Milne\u2019s views. In a series of\nlectures given at Harvard in late 1932 and published early in the new\nyear as The Expanding Universe, Eddington denied the efficacy\nof both operationalism and hypothetico-deductivism, and not only\ndefended explanatory realism, but strengthened his ontological\nposition heroically: the theoretical entities of relativistic\ncosmology were not just plausible, they were so necessary to\nunderstanding the universe, that cosmological knowledge was\nessentially impossible without them (Eddington 1933, p. 19).\n4.1 Dingle\u2019s First Attacks\n\nFew others would ever go so far as Eddington\u2019s ontological\nheroism; yet epistemological and methodological heroism in the fight\nagainst Milne was not rare. Chief hero in this aspect of the attack on\nMilne was Herbert Dingle, a highly respected astrophysicist, and\nthen-secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dingle\u2019s\ninitial foray appeared as a response to Milne\u2019s first detailed\npresentation of kinematic relativity (Milne 1933). After claiming that\nwhile kinematic relativity did not differ appreciably from\nrelativistic cosmology in its mathematical formalism or observable\nconsequences, Dingle asserted that, on the other hand, it invited\nspecial criticism because it renounced \u201cthe fundamental\nprinciples of scientific method\u201d, namely, \u201cNewton\u2019s\nprinciple of induction from phenomena\u201d (Dingle 1933, p. 178).\nDingle was never to relent in his attacks upon Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deductivism, at all times rejecting the methodology as\neven a possible candidate for acceptance by genuine science.\n\nDingle\u2019s article appeared back-to-back with an appraisal of\nkinematic relativity by the important American cosmologist H. P.\nRobertson (Robertson 1933a). Robertson focussed upon Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deducivism as well, noting that the cosmological principle\nin kinematic relativity functions as an a priori rule, rather\nthan as an empirical generalization, its status in relativistic\ncosmology. Robertson otherwise is not especially taken with\nMilne\u2019s theory, limiting himself to remarks suggesting that,\nwhere they can be compared, kinematic relativity and relativistic\ncosmology apparently are similar in physical content. As we shall\nshortly see, Robertson\u2019s later work strongly belied this earlier\napparent indifference to Milne\u2019s theory.\n4.2 Two Ways to Disagree with Milne\n\nRight from the start, cosmologists differed in their opinions about\nboth the physical content of Milne\u2019s theory, and its underlying\nphilosophy. Dingle disliked Milne\u2019s methods, but found the\ntheory itself of not much interest. Robertson initially agreed with\nDingle, but within a short time had significant changes of heart.\nEddington disliked both the theory and its philosophy, finding them\nfar too deviant from what was typical, i.e., relativistic cosmology\nand its mainstream philosophy. Younger cosmologists such as McVittie\nand McCrea, students, respectively, of Eddington and Whittaker, soon\njoined the fray. McVittie initially found the physics of kinematic\nrelativity quite interesting, and quite different from the physics of\nrelativistic cosmology (McVittie 1933b). But Milne\u2019s philosophy\nwas something else; the strict empiricism McVittie had earlier\nrevealed (McVittie 1933a) made him equally unhappy with both\nMilne\u2019s rationalism and his hypothetico-deductivism.\n\nMcCrea\u2019s remarks were among the most perceptive and favorable\n(Kermack and McCrea 1933). While he thought that Milne\u2019s\noperationalist criticisms of curved and expanding space were of little\nimport, McCrea was the first to notice the parsimony and elegance of\nMilne\u2019s strictly kinematic solution to the problem of the origin\nof the universe\u2019s expansion. Since a search for such a solution\nhad vexed relativistic cosmology for several years (McVittie 1931),\nMcCrea suggested that Milne\u2019s mechanism should be immdiately\nshown to be part of relativistic cosmology (Kermack and McCrea 1933 p.\n529).\n\nClearly, the so-recently won consensus about relativistic cosmology\nand its philosophy had dissolved into confusion and controversy over\nMilne and his methods.\n4.3 Milne Makes Philosophical Improvements\n\nOver the next year or so, Milne made strenuous efforts to elucidate\nboth kinematic relativity\u2019s physics and its philosophy,\nbeginning, as would be his wont, with the philosophy. In October,\nMilne addressed the Philosophical Association, giving an explicit and\ndetailed analysis not only of his philosophical views, but also of\ntheir history, which, he claimed, extended back to Locke and Hume\n(Milne 1934a) His description of the two opposed\nmethods\u2014inductive empiricism vs.\nhypothetico-deductivism\u2014is quite clear and useful:\n\nStrictly speaking, physics has no philosophy. It has method\u2026Now\nthe methods of theoretical physics seem to be reducible to two\nspecies, the method of starting with concepts and the method of\nstarting with things observed. \u2026When a subject is developed\nfrom concepts the concepts play the part of the terms occurring in the\naxioms of geometry\u2026. The concepts are undefined save as being\ngoverned by propositions of which they are subjects.\n\n\nMilne\u2019s commitment to axiomatization is notable here. It was\nbased in his earlier admiration for the work of Whitehead and Russell\n(Crowther 1970); commitment to axiomatization in cosmology, once\nhaving been initiated by Milne, would be an enduring hallmark of the\nwork of many, including both Robertson and Walker.\n\nThree weeks after this address, Milne spoke on related topics at the\nmonthly meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. His main point was\nthat theories differed only insofar as their concepts could be cashed\nout in observations deduced from them. Eddington took strong exception\nto Milne\u2019s arguments, claiming in response that kinematic\nrelativity and relativistic cosmology differed more importantly in\ntheir ontology than in their consequences. Eddington was especially\nconcerned with differences in the spacetime-geometry each theory\nascribed to the world. For Eddington and his colleagues, the\nequivalence of gravitation and spacetime geometry was a genuine\nreality, a feature of the physical world, just as real as suns and\nmoons and stars.\n4.4 A Major Philosophical Issue: What makes a scientific theory \u2018good\u2019?\n\nMilne was having none of it. In the next month\u2019s\nObservatory\u2014the informal monthly publication of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\u2014he took Eddington and his\ntheoretical-realist colleagues to task, concluding that\n\u201ctheories differ simply and solely when their predictions as to\nphenomena differ\u201d; most importantly, \u201cthis method of\ncomparison avoids all reference to distance-assignments,\nworld-geometry, schemes of projection or the like\u201d (Milne\n1934b). In other words, metaphysics was to be avoided in cosmology;\nspace, spacetime, geometry and the like were to be rejected as\nscientific realities, replaced by reference simply and solely to\nobservations. The only realities, according to Milne, were what could\nbe reported among observers about light signals and clocks.\n\nDuring 1934 Milne worked together with his new student A.G. Walker.\nWalker never evinced much interest in the philosophical aspects of\nkinematic relativity, choosing instead to focus tightly upon working\nout the physical details of the theory itself. He had immediate\nsuccess (Walker 1934). One of his important conclusions was that other\nauthors, specifically McVittie and Robertson, were wrong to conclude\nthat the physics of Milne\u2019s theory ultimately corresponded to\nrelativistic cosmology: \u201cMilne\u2019s system is\nfundamentally different from that of general relativity\u201d\n(Walker 1934 p. 489; emphasis in original).\n4.5 How to Choose Among Theories and Philosophies?\n\nIn an important review of the entire confused situation between\nkinematic relativity and relativistic cosmology, McVittie confessed\nthat \u201cexperimentally it seems hopeless to discriminate between\nthem\u2026at present the choice is almost entirely a matter of\npersonal taste\u201d (McVittie 1934 p. 29). At almost the same time,\nde Sitter took on Milne in serious fashion (de Sitter 1934).\nResponding to Milne\u2019s methodological challenge, he showed that,\nindeed, it is possible to formulate relativistic cosmology in\naxiomatic fashion, just as Milne had formulated kinematic relativity\n\u201cfrom concepts.\u201d But de Sitter explicitly rejected\nMilne\u2019s philosophical use of the cosmological principle,\n\u201cwhich asserts that statistically the world pictures of two\ndifferent observers must be the same.\u201d His objection is founded\non the matter-of-fact that \u201cwe have, however, no means of\ncommunicating with other observers, situated on faraway stars, or\nmoving with excessive velocities\u201d (de Sitter 1934 p. 598). So\nmuch for rational principles as hypotheses!\n\nThe year in cosmology ended almost as confused as it had begun, with\none exception: Milne had gotten much clearer about his philosophical\nviews, and was applying them to an exhaustive presentation of his\ncosmology, theory and philosophy. His book Relativity, Gravitation\nand World Structure (Milne 1935) would be published in just a few\nmonths.\n5. The Triumph of Milne\u2019s Methods 1935\u201336.\n\nThe new year marked a sudden change. In short order, McCrea, Walker\nand Robertson succumbed to Milne\u2019s methodological\nrecommendations: first, to carry out an operationalist paring of\nnon-observational concepts, then, secondly, to embed the resulting\nminimalist concept set in an axiomatic hypothetical-deductive\nstructure. Thus was the famous Robertson-Walker spacetime metric\nborn.\n5.1 McCrea, Walker and Robertson Adopt Milne\u2019s Methods\n\nMcCrea\u2019s effort operationalized the concept of\n\u201cdistance\u201d, principally and originally by comparison of\ncertain elements of Newtonian cosmology and de Sitter\u2019s\naxiomatized version of relativistic cosmology (McCrea 1935).\nWalker\u2019s paper specifically eschewed use of \u201cany\nindefinable concepts\u201d, in particular, he did not assume that the\n\u201cassociated metric [of relativistic cosmology] has any a\npriori physical significance\u201d (Walker 1935).\nRobertson\u2019s article, the first of three, is the most important,\nboth in its content, and in the signal it sends, namely, that one of\nthe original mainstream relativistic cosmology proponents has adopted\na major element of Milne\u2019s new philosophy for cosmology\n(Robertson 1935). Robertson\u2019s conclusion exhibits this point\nclearly and explicitly:\n\nWe have examined, from the operational standpoint, the problem of\ndetermining the most general kinematical background suitable for an\nidealized universe in which the cosmological principle holds. Allowing\nthe fundamental observers the use only of clocks and theodolites, and\ngranting them the possibility of sending and receiving we have shown\nthat for each given mode of motion x(t) there necessarily\nexists a quadratic line element which is invariant, in form as well as\nin fact, under transformation from one fundamental observer to\nanother. (Robertson 1935 p. 300)\n\n\nUnlike de Sitter, Robertson accepts the cosmological principle,\nreplete with its observers on far-separated particles. Moreover, as\nthis statement shows, Robertson is intimately familiar with\nMilne\u2019s latest operationalist reduction: space is to be reduced\nto time measurements given by clock readings on signals exchanged\nbetween observers. Robertson gets this idea from Milne\u2019s book,\nwhich he had earlier reviewed (but which was only subsequently\npublished) for Astrophysical Journal (Robertson 1936).\n5.2 But Eddington Scoffed\u2026\n\nEddington disparages these same methods. In his scathing\nNature review of Milne\u2019s book, he rejects Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deductivism, his cosmological principle, and, above all,\nhis operationalism: \u201cWhen I visit the Cavendish Laboratory, I do\nnot find its occupants engaged in flashing light-signals at each\nother, but I find practically everyone employing rigid scales or their\nequivalent\u201d (Eddington 1935, p. 636). Whittaker\u2019s review\nwas not so negative as Eddington\u2019s (Whittaker 1935). While the\nsenior physicist rejects Milne\u2019s operationalism and attacks upon\nthe geometrical commitments of relativistic proponents, he is\nconsiderably more forgiving about Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deductivism, and even goes so far as to remark\nMilne\u2019s \u201cbrilliant record in astrophysical\ndiscovery.\u201d Nonetheless, Milne\u2019s break with a tradition\nincluding at least \u201cEinstein, de Sitter, Friedmann,\nLeMa\u00eetre, Weyl, Eddington, H.P. Robertson and others\u201d is\nto be regretted (Whittaker 1935 p. 179). Perhaps, along with\nEddington, Whittaker hopes that soon \u201cProfessor Milne will\nreturn to orthodoxy\u201d (Eddington 1935, p. 636).\n\nBut Whittaker\u2019s view on Milne must be put into the perspective\nhe held on the whole ongoing debate. As he saw it\n\n\u2026a lively debate is in progress at the present moment between\nSir Arthur Eddington and Dr Harold Jeffreys of Cambridge, Professor\nMilne of Oxford, Sir James Jeans, and Professor Dingle of the Imperial\nCollege, the subject being the respective shares of reason and\nobservation in the discovery of the laws of nature. (Whittaker 1941,\np. 160)\n\n\nBut lively debate is far too gentlemanly a description for what now\noccurred. After holding his ire somewhat in check for\u2014as he saw\nit\u2014already far too long, Dingle finally erupted.\n6. Dingle\u2019s Denoument\n\nControversy over Milne and his philosophy reached a crescendo in\nmid-1937. Dingle, his stew having finally boiled over, wrote privately\nto the editor of Nature, first castigating the rampant\ncosmological \u2018mysticism\u2019 passing itself off for science,\nand then offering to produce an article taking the sword to the\nmystics themselves. His offer was immediately accepted. The result was\nDingle\u2019s notorious \u201cModern Aristotelianism\u201d, a\npolemical diatribe chiefly against Milne, but aimed as well at\nEddington and Dirac on account of their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the\nscientific method of Newton and his fellow members of the Royal\nSociety (Dingle 1937).\n6.1 Modern Aristotles?\n\nThe article is remarkable both for its style and for its content.\nDingle\u2019s style in the article is vituperative. Thus,\nemotionally-loaded terms such as \u201cparalysis of reason\u201d,\n\u201cintoxication of the fancy\u201d, \u201c\u2018Universe\u2019\nmania\u201d, and the like frequently appear, these to be topped only\nby references to \u201cdelusions\u201d, \u201ctraitors\u201d, and,\nof course, \u201ctreachery\u201d, each associated with one or more\nof the guilty parties (Dingle 1937, p. 786).\n\nAbove and beyond his extreme language, Dingle makes certain\nsubstantive claims bearing directly upon central philosophical\nquestions. The issue, as he sees it, is nothing more than the question\n\u201cWhether the foundation of science shall be observation\nor invention\u201d (Dingle 1937, p. 786). As always, talk about\n\u2018foundations\u2019 is philosophical talk. The two opposing\npositions Dingle here calls \u201cfoundational\u201d involve views\non both method and epistemology, suitably tangled together. Dingle\ndelineates the opposed alternatives as follows. The way of true\nscience, he claims, shows that \u201cthe first step in the study of\nNature should be sense observation, no general principles being\nadmitted which are not derived by induction therefrom\u201d (Dingle\n1937, p. 784). Stated more explicitly, Dingle here argues that\nauthentic science is empiricist in epistemology\n(scientific knowledge is founded in sensory observation), and\ninductivist in method (general principles are reached\nvia inductive logic). Opposed to this view, he argues, is \u201cthe\ndoctrine that Nature is the visible working-out of general principles\nknown to the human mind apart from sense perception\u201d (Dingle\n1937, p. 787). As representative of this latter view Dingle cites\nMilne, and refers in particular to Milne\u2019s claim that \u201cit\nis, in fact, possible to derive the laws of dynamics\nrationally\u2026without recourse to experience\u201d (Milne 1937,\np. 329). Obviously, Dingle is here arguing against the view,\nMilne\u2019s view, that authentic science may be\nrationalist in epistemology (scientific knowledge is\nfounded in pure theoretical reasoning apart from sense perception),\nand hypothetico-deductive in method (general\nprinciples are justified by their deductively implying correct\nobservations).\n\nAlong with Milne, Dingle indicts Eddington, and, by implication,\nDirac, all three of whom, Dingle believes, are guilty of inventing\nscientific hypotheses by free mental imaginings rather than by strict\nimmersion in observations and observational data.\n6.2 Dingle as \u2018True Believer\u2019\n\nWhat is going on here? Put bluntly, Dingle is an old-fashioned\nempiricist and inductivist. He believes that the only way to do true\nscience is to first collect data, then, and only then, to hypothesize\non the basis of that data. Observation, then hypothesis. As he sees\nit, Eddington, Milne and Dirac have got it exactly backwards. They\nfirst (as he terms it) assume an hypothesis, then, and only then, go\nabout collecting data. Except, according to his lights, the data\nisn\u2019t ever collected: \u201cto [the Aristotelians\u2019]\nmodern representatives it seems as though a fancy is no sooner in the\nhead than it is on paper and sent for publication\u201d (Dingle 1937,\np. 785). Obviously Dingle is simply wrong; it never occurred to his\nopponents that hypotheses would not be followed\nimmediately by attempts at deductive prediction of observational\nconsequences. But it was enough, in Dingle\u2019s mind, that they\ndidn\u2019t use induction, for them to come under blame.\n6.3 Wrong from the Very Start\n\nBut there is something else at work here as well. Dingle doesn\u2019t\nobject solely to his opponents\u2019 lack of inductive logic. Of\nequal importance is the fact that they find the source of their\nhypotheses in fairly general principles, wide-ranging rational\nproposals about the structure of the universe at large. These\nprinciples Dingle takes to be a priori, in the most\npejorative sense of that term. They are phantasms,\n\u201cchimeras\u201d he calls them, which seduce the imaginations of\nhis opponents, and lead them and their dumb-struck admirers away from\nthe genuine, authentic method of science. This is\nwhat really sticks in Dingle\u2019s craw. In turn, Eddington, Milne\nand Dirac are chastised, each for something slightly different, but at\nbottom the same, namely, they one and all \u201cappear as a victim of\nthe great \u2018Universe\u2019 mania\u201d (Dingle 1937, p. 786).\nIn the end, Dingle believes, the danger of this new\n\u2018methodology\u2019 is real, and serious. As he notes in\nconclusion:\n\nNor are we dealing with a mere skin disease which time itself will\nheal. Such ailments are familiar enough; every age has its delusions\nand every cause its traitors. But the danger here is radical. Our\nleaders themselves are bemused, so that treachery can pass unnoticed\nand even think itself fidelity. It is the noblest minds that are\no\u2019erthrown\u2026the very council of the elect can violate its\ncharter and think it is doing science service. (Dingle 1937, p. 786)\n\n\nHere Dingle obviously goes over the top. Yet overblown as it is, there\nis no doubting his sincerity: Milne and the other cosmologists have\nbetrayed the true science bequeathed them by their ancestors in the\nRoyal Society.\n\nHow could Dingle be answered?\n6.4 The Debate Goes Very Public\n\nThe response arrived three months later, on 12 June. On this\nparticular Saturday in June, Nature published a fifteen-page\nspecial supplement as No. 3528. Contained within were contributions\nfrom sixteen \u201crepresentative investigators\u201d, as the editor\nreferred to them, each responding to \u201cModern\nAristotelianism\u201d Nature\u2019s Editor, R.A. Gregory,\nintroduces the occasion by noting that \u201cin Nature of\nMay 8, we published an article by Dr. Herbert Dingle entitled\n\u2018Modern Aristotelianism\u2019\u201d. Because the article, as\nGregory goes on to say, \u201ccreated considerable interest\u201d,\nNature \u201cdecided to invite further contributions on the\nsubject from a number of representative investigators.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreated considerable interest\u201d is, to understate the\nissue, an understatement. Some of the contributors were quite\nobviously livid with rage and other volatile emotions. Others, such as\nMilne himself, who had come in for particularly scathing criticism in\nDingle\u2019s article, were patient and careful in rebuttal. Each of\nthe sixteen contributors to the special article chose a side in the\ncontroversy, either pro Dingle\u2019s inductive empiricism, and con\nMilne et al.\u2019s rationalist hypothetico-deductivism, or vice\nversa. Remarks made by the participants exhibit the full diversity of\nphilosophy of science in their contemporary community. Dingle\u2019s\nviews, in particular, were not without favor.\n\nHarold Jeffreys, F.R.S., noted geologist and astronomer, and author of\na well-regarded philosophy of science book Scientific\nInference (1957), led off with a nice ad hominem:\n\u201cWithout using induction, Milne and Eddington could not order\ntheir lives for a day, and what they are really asserting is that they\nare entitled to use special axioms in physics, for which no need has\nbeen shown.\u201d Jeffreys\u2019 criticism here of course ignores\nthe role of deductive observations in justifying the\n\u201cspecial\u201d axioms. The problem, as Jeffreys sees it,\noriginates in the perpetrators\u2019 \u201cbelief that there is some\nspecial virtue in mathematics.\u201d L.N.G. Filon, F.R.S.,\nvice-chancellor of the University of London agrees on this point,\nnoting that \u201csome men of science appear to think that they can\nsolve the whole problem of Nature by some all-inclusive mathematical\nintuition.\u201d R.A. Sampson, the Astronomer Royal, focusses upon\nthe rationalistic aspects of the \u2018modern Aristotelians\u2019,\nto wit, for their \u201cframing a theory independent of experience,\nsuch as is denounced in Dr. Dingle\u2019s article\u201d, which\nproduces work not unlike that \u201cof a poet or other humanist, who\ngives us at most a number of illustrative cases.\u201d\n6.5 The Counterattack\n\nBut Milne, Eddington, and Dirac had their supporters as well. N.R.\nCampbell, whose theory of science was already well-known, makes an\nuncontroversial interpretation of the affair. \u201cScience\u201d he\nbegins, \u201c(or at least physics) has long consisted of two\ndistinct but complementary activities\u201d, one of which is\nexperimental and empirical; \u201cits procedure is induction.\u201d\nThe other activity attempts to provide explanations of scientific\nlaws, which explanations have the \u201cpecularity\u201d that\n\u201cthey often (not always) predict new laws in addition to\nexplaining old ones.\u201d Campbell cannot resist ending on an ad\nhominem of his own: \u201cIf he [Dingle] does not deem it\nimportant to observe the distinction between what is and what is not\ndemonstrable experiment, surely he should welcome a movement to\namalgamate the Royal with the Aristotelian Society.\u201d Indeed.\n\nG.J. Whitrow, then a young lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford, returns\nto the mathematical theme. Dingle, he argues, \u201cnot only attacks\nthe particular methods adopted by contemporary mathematical\ninvestigators in relativistic cosmology, but even refuses to admit\nthat this subject is worthy of scientific investigation as it is based\nnot only on experience but also on reason.\u201d Hypotheses, by this\nlight, may originate rationalistically as well as any other way,\ncertainly there is no problem with this.\n6.6 The Coolest Voice\n\nThe clearest, most temperate description of the issues at hand is\ngiven by young cosmologist William McCrea, then professor of\nmathematics at Queen\u2019s, Belfast, and editor of the\nR.A.S.\u2019s Observatory. Not to be outdone by Jeffreys,\nMcCrea begins with an ad hominem of his own: \u201cDr. H.\nDingle\u2019s objection to \u2018modern Aristotelianism\u2019 seems\nto be itself what he would call Aristotelian rather than\nGalilean.\u201d In other words, Dingle raises a non-empirical\nobjection about Milne et al.\u2019s non-empiricism! But\nMcCrea soon gets to the heart of the matter, the role of\nhypothetico-deductivism in mathematical physics:\n\nWhat Dr. Dingle has done is to reopen the question of the relation of\nmathematical physics to experimental physics, since he claims to\ndetect a new and perverted point of view in the former. Now a system\nof mathematical physics, apart from the alleged perversion, is the\nworking out of the mathematical consequences of certain hypotheses.\nThe worth of the theory is judged\u2026by the closeness of the\nagreement of its predictions with the results of observation, and also\nthe number of phenomena which it can so predict from the one set of\nhypotheses. The scientific attitude is, not to cavil at the attempt,\nbut to see if it is successful.\n\n\nThis is an absolutely standard interpretation of how the H-D method\nworks. Throughout his own writings, beginning right from his inaugural\nlecture in Oxford (Milne 1929), Milne had subscribed to precisely the\nsame interpretation of the Hypothetico-Deductive (H-D) method.\nWhatever the controversy is about, the issue is not how to interpret\nhypothetico-deductivism. That much is evident.\n\nMoreover, it is quite clear that Dingle et al. are not\nmounting opposition to something we, today, would consider\nphilosophically radical; rather, they are objecting to what, today,\nwould be considered completely unobjectionable. Given today\u2019s\nacceptance of the H-D method, yet its rejection by otherwise\nwell-regarded scientists at that time, it seems to follow that it was,\nat least in part, this debate and its followup which settled the\nissue. In any case, Dingle and his supporters generally went silent,\nrestricting their activities for the most part to books, or relatively\npositive statements of their own positions (A.D.R. 1938, Dingle 1938).\nThings settled down, just in time for the War.\n7. The Calm Between the Storms\n\nDuring the next several years, it became evident that Milne\u2019s\nmethods, and kinematic relativity as well, had reached respectability.\nOne important sign of this progress was exhibited at an early 1939\njoint meeting between the Royal Astronomical Society and the Physical\nSociety of London, The meeting had as its goal a thorough review of\nthe situation in cosmology. McVittie was chosen to present the\nobservational situation; his report was soon published (McVittie,\n1939). Reviewing the theoretical situation was George Temple, one of\nthe most highly respected mathematicians of the time. Temple\u2019s\nreport saw print almost immediately (Temple 1939). Within a short\ntime, Temple\u2019s paper took on the role of successor to\nRobertson\u2019s definitive 1933 \u201cRelativistic Cosmology\u201d\n(Robertson 1933b).\n7.1 Two Equal Competitors\n\nBoth McVittie and Temple presented kinematic relativity and\nrelativistic cosmology as equal competitors in accounting for the\ncosmological observations. Unfortunately, as McVittie noted,\nobservations could not, at that time, discriminate between the two\ntheories. Temple\u2019s analysis of Milne\u2019s work praises its\nsimplicity and elegance, and refers in particular to its\noperationalism and axiomatization, which \u201cstart from a\ncompletely novel discussion of the correlation of measurements made by\ndifferent observers in terms of light signals only\u201d (Temple\n1939, p. 468). Throughout the rest of his discussion of the two\ntheories, Temple utilizes Milne\u2019s light-signal correlation\nmethod, explicitly rejecting rigid-rod transport for distance\nmeasurement. Milne\u2019s methods have triumphed.\n\nLater that year McCrea published an important paper in Philosophy\nof Science (McCrea 1939). Put most simply, the paper starts out\nto defend Milne\u2019s methods, but ends up by presenting a\nfull-blown and interesting, although quite unhistorical, account of\nthe evolution and structure of physical theories.\n7.2 The Origin and Evolution of Theories\n\nMcCrea\u2019s overall view is that theories are set up to be\nhypothetico-deductive in structure. His account is based on his view\nof the evolution of theories of space-time and mechanics, beginning\nwith Newton, through the General Theory of Relativity and ending in\nkinematic relativity. His argument reduces to the claim that, insofar\nas Milne and e.g., Newton, can be shown to follow the same procedure,\nany attack upon Milne is also an attack upon Newton. First, he states\nhis goals in the paper.\n\nThe first goal is to emphasise how each theory leaves us in a position\nin which the succeeding one appears as a perfectly natural next step\nin the development of ideas (McCrea 1939, p. 137). McCrea embeds this\nargument in an account of how analogue models (\u00e0 la Campbell)\nare used to set up new theories\u2014this is essentially an account\nof how discovery might proceed in linking an older theory with its\nsuccessor. The second goal is to show how, in spite of superficial\ndifferences in character, the theories in question all necessarily\npossess the same general structure constituted by the presence of\nhypotheses, from which certain general mathematical relations are\ndeduced, which in their turn are used to predict relations between\nobservable quantities. As McCrea notes, \u201cthis study may claim an\ninterest of its own, but it is presented also for a further\nreason\u201d namely, that\n\nit has been contended [by Dingle, most especially] that theories like\nMilne\u2019s represent a fundamentally new outlook on the part of\nsome theorists, in that such theories are purely mental constructs\ndivorced from experience of the physical world. We shall see that on\nthe contrary Milne\u2019s theory is easily brought into line with the\nothers in such a way that this criticism is neither more nor less true\nof it than of the rest. (McCrea 1939, p. 138)\n\n\nIn McCrea\u2019s discussion of the theories he asserts that\n\u201cthe consituents [of the theories themselves] which are of\nphysical significance are sets of mathematical relations, coupled with\nsets of rules of interpretation\u201d which yield, \u201cafter\nobservational test, descriptions rather than explanations of physical\nphenomena.\u201d According to McCrea, one real advantage of his view\nis that it \u201cleads to simple criteria for comparing the merits of\ndifferent theories.\u201d Finally, on the metaphysics of the original\nhypotheses, McCrea claims that \u201cthe initial hypotheses from\nwhich the mathematical relations are deduced do not ultimately have\nany direct physical significance.\u201d\n\nMcCrea\u2019s paper, published in the leading philosophy of science\njournal of the time, is the final imprimateur on Milne\u2019s\nviews.\n7.3 Milne\u2019s Ultimate Success\n\nThree years later, Milne was awarded the James Scott prize, the most\nprestigious award for \u2018natural philosophy\u2019 in the\nAnglophone world. Milne\u2019s lecture title is telling:\n\u201cFundamental Concepts of Natural Philosophy\u201d (Milne 1943).\nAlthough Milne does concede to Dingle that he no longer believes that\nit is possible to deduce physics completely in the absence of\nreference to phenomena, for the most part his award lecture is a long\nreiteration of his previous twelve years\u2019 work in cosmology.\n\nOne year later, Milne received his ultimate accolade, election as\npresident of the Royal Astronomical Society. In his inaugural lecture,\nMilne again reviews his work, but adds two remarks of interest. First,\nhe modifies his earlier view that theories are acceptable solely on\nthe basis of their successful predictive power; to this, he now adds\nthat a theory cannot be accepted as satisfactory unless it is\nphilosophically satisfying (Milne 1943, p. 120). Secondly, on a\npersonal note, he admits that he is still amazed at the outcry that\nhis theory and its philosophy caused. Milne here is being a bit\ndisingenuous. In many places in his letters he not only recognizes the\noutcry, he delights in it, and seeks to provoke it even more (Milne\n1932\u201337, 12 May 35; 28 Jul 36).\n\nFrom this point onward, cosmology\u2019s philosophy is no longer\ndirectly influenced by Milne himself. Moreover, kinematic relativity\nbegan to stagnate as a research programme; except for Whitrow, Milne\nhad no new students, and failed to attract any new converts to the\ntheory (Whitrow, 1996). His personal philosophical work was done.\n\nBut although his personal philosophical work was done, and kinematic\nrelativity seemed moribund as a research program, in the late 1990s it\nwas rediscovered, and Milne\u2019s model, as it was\nchristened, came into renewed interest as a source of predictions for\ncosmological behaviour such as rates of cosmic expansion, and\nproduction of cosmological strings. (Moncy, 2016; Russo, 2003).\n\nBut even though Milne himself retreated into the background, his\nphilosophical influence didn\u2019t end, in fact it wasn\u2019t to\ncrest until the end of the 40s in the work of another man, Hermann\nBondi. Again, however, a storm was generated by Milne\u2019s methods,\neven though they were now in the hands of another.\n8. Steady-state Cosmology\n\nIn 1948, a young mathematician, Herman Bondi, in concert with two\nclose friends Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle, proposed a radical new\ncosmological theory, the Steady State theory. This theory\ndiffers from the basic picture shared by both kinematic relativity and\nrelativistic cosmology, namely, that of a universe with a definite\norigin in a small, dense knot, followed by evolution into the universe\nwe have today. According to Bondi\u2019s theory, the universe as far\nback into the past as we might look would always look the same; there\nwas no evolution, there could be no \u201cfossils\u201d, as Bondi\ncalled putative evidence of a universe different in the past from our\npresent one. What we observe today is the same state of a universe\nthat has been and always will be steady. Bondi came to his notion of\nthe steady state primarily from his commitment to the philosophical\ncomponents of Milne\u2019s work, most especially the methodology of\nrationalism plus hypothetico-deductivism; additionally, Bondi coupled\nto these Milnean notions some ideas taken directly from the philosophy\nof Karl Popper.\n8.1 Bondi\u2019s Philosophical Origins\n\nBondi reveals his philosophical commitments in several ways. First, he\nargues against induction and extrapolation from small-scale\nexperiment, that is, against the inductive empiricism of Dingle et\nal. Secondly, he argues in favor of hypothesis and deduction,\nthat is, in favor of Milne et al. Finally, he specifically\nremarks the excellence of Milne\u2019s Methods, and the\ntheory\u2014kinematic relativity\u2014created therefrom, and remarks\nthe significance of these elements in the creation of his version of\nthe new steady-state cosmology.\n\nFrom the very beginning Bondi admits the validity of both positions in\nthe methodological debate:\n\nIn particular, there are two important approaches to the subject\n[cosmology] so different from each other that it is hardly surprising\nthat they lead to different answers\u2026The contrast between the\n\u2018extrapolating\u2019 and the \u2018deductive\u2019 attitudes\nto cosmology is very great indeed. (Bondi 1960), p. 3\u20135)\n\n\nThe extrapolating approach, which Bondi sometimes calls the\nempirical school, is represented by Dingle, McVittie, and\ntheir colleagues. Opposed to the extrapolative approach is the\ndeductive approach, which \u201cis reached from\ninvestigations in the borderland between physics and\nphilosophy.\u201d Milne is obviously the major proponent of this\nview. Although Bondi finds good points in both approaches, he also\nfinds problems in both approaches. In the end, cosmology is the worse\nfor excesses from either end of the spectrum:\n\nJust as some adherents of the \u2018empirical\u2019 school tend to\nregard cosmology as a testing ground for their extrapolations and as a\nlegitimate playground for the geometers, so some adherents of the\ndeductive approach appear to regard cosmology as a purely logical\nsubject. (Bondi 1960, p. 7)\n\n\nIn this latter case, the deductive extremists, in their mathematical\nzeal, seem to forget that cosmology, after all,\nshould have some relation to observation: \u201cTo\nthem all that is of interest in a theory is its logical character, not\nits relevance to the interpretation of observational data.\u201d\nObviously, this danger must be avoided: according to Bondi,\ndeductivism can be a scientific approach in\ncosmology only if its postulates (or axioms) are candidates for\ndisproof.\n8.2 Enter Popper\n\nClearly, with this reference to the connection between science and\ndisproof, Bondi has added a distinctly Poppererian element to the\ndeductivist methodology, one which had not previously appeared in the\nworks of any of the earlier members of the hypothetico-deductive\nschool. According to Popper\u2019s philosophy of science, a theory\ncan legitimately be called \u201cscientific\u201d only if that\ntheory makes a prediction that, in principle, can be shown to be\nfalse, or falsified, to use Popper\u2019s own term. Thus\nastrology, for example, fails to be a scientific theory because it\ncannot be falsified: although astrology seems to make predictions,\nthese statements about the future are so vague, so general and\nabstract, that they cannot be tied down to definite claims about\nobservations to be made at a definite time and place. Hence there is\nno explicit observation to be made in falsification. Astronomy, in\ncomparison, makes explicit, specific predictions about what will occur\nin the sky on such-and-such a date, in such-and-such a place. If the\nprediction fails, then we know that the element of astronomical theory\nwhich made the prediction is deficient, maybe even false.\n\nCosmology is a borderline case: since observations of cosmological\nsignificance are so rare and hard-won\u2014Hubble\u2019s observation\nof the red shift was one of the first solid ones\u2014it is very\ndifficult, not to mention brave, to tie one\u2019s cosmological\ntheory to Popper\u2019s falsificationist principle as a guarantee of\nscientific acceptability. But this is exactly what Bondi did.\n\nMuch later Bondi was to make explicit his debt to Popper:\n\nI think the person from whom we had most help on the philosophical\nside was Popper. His analysis of science encouraged one to be\nimaginative, and encouraged one to go for something that was very\nrigid and therefore empirically disprovable. (Bondi 1990, p. 194)\n\n8.3 But It\u2019s Milne In the End\n\nYet Bondi\u2019s major philosophical debt was to Milne. According to\nBondi, Milne\u2019s theory was through and through deductive, which\nwas reason enough for some of his colleagues to condemn it:\n\nThe aim of this discipline [= kinematic relativity] is to deduce as\nmuch as possible merely from the cosmological principle and the basic\nproperties of space, time and the propagation of light. The beauty of\nthis, as indeed of any deductive theory, rests on the rigour of the\narguments and the small number of the axioms required...When the\ntheory was first developed it met with great hostility and was\ncriticized very severely, often unjustly, and sometimes frivolously.\n(Bondi 1960), p. 123)\n\n\nIn addition to his admiration of Milne\u2019s H-D methodology, Bondi\nhas high praise as well for Milne\u2019s operationalism, particularly\nits use in defining distance:\n\nImperfect as Milne\u2019s definition of distance may be, it is very\nmuch better than the \u2018rigid ruler\u2019 one used in most other\ntheories\u2026Milne\u2019s definition of distance, by no means\nperfect as it is, is probably the best yet devised. (Bondi 1960, p.\n126\u20139)\n\n\nIn the end, Bondi sums up Milne\u2019s contributions with no\nuncertain praise:\n\nThe foregoing brief description will have indicated the remarkable\nsuccess of kinematic relativity in attempting to use the cosmological\nprinciple not only for the construction of the substratum but as chief\nguide in formulating ordinary physics. In this respect it differs\ngreatly from all other cosmologies which either rely on a\nconventionally obtained body of physics or have not yet succeeded in\ndrawing conclusions of local interest from the cosmological principle.\n(Bondi 1960, p. 136)\n\n8.4 Return of the Cosmological Principle\n\nHere Bondi speaks of Milne\u2019s cosmological principle. According\nto Milne\u2019s principle, every observer in the universe should get\nthe same world picture, that is, should make precisely the same\nobservations of the universe at the same moment as any other observer\n(Milne 1934b). Uniformity over spatial slices is guaranteed by\nMilne\u2019s invoking of the principle. Yet Milne\u2019s universe\nevolves, it changes its form over time. Hence it has no temporal\nuniformity. Bondi felt that this raised the possibility that physics\nitself might change over time. Because of this risk, Bondi generalized\nMilne\u2019s cosmological principle into what he called the\nperfect cosmological principle [= PCP]. According to this\nprinciple, all observers at all places and at all\ntimes will look out upon the same unchanging, unevolving,\nuniverse. Such a universe is a universe in a steady-state\u2014hence\nthe name.\n\nClearly, PCP is a daring, indeed heroic, interpretation of a\nmethodological necessity. Forty years after the fact, Bondi described\nthe \u201cphilosophical attitude\u201d which underlay his\n\u201cimplausible\u201d PCP:\n\nBut the essential point of the philosophy was and is that if the\nuniverse was evolving and changing, then there is no reason to trust\nwhat we call the laws of physics, established by experiments performed\nhere and now, to have permanent validity. (Bondi 1990, p. 192)\n\n\nHence, or so Bondi\u2019s argument goes, since there is reason\nnot to trust the laws of physics if the universe is\nevolving, let us presume that the universe is not\nevolving and changing; that is, let us presume PCP. Although the\nprinciple (and the theory which results from it\u2014steady state\ncosmology) is, as McVittie remarked, \u201cmuch more restrictive than\ngeneral relativity\u201d; (McVittie 1990, p. 45) it is this very\nrestrictiveness which satisfies Bondi\u2019s Popperian wishes:\n\nFor the correct argument has always been that the steady state model\nwas the one that could be disproved most easily by observation,\nTherefore, it should take precedence over other less disprovable ones\nuntil it has been disproved. (Bondi and Kilmister 1959, p. 55\u20136)\n\n\nIn another place, Bondi makes a similar point: \u201cComparison with\nobservation becomes then possible and renders the PCP liable to\nobservational disproof. This possibility of a clear-cut disproof\nestablishes the scientific status of PCP\u201d (Bondi 1957, p. 198).\nComments such as this make clear Bondi\u2019s committment to a\nPopperian addition to the basic deductive methodology he inherited\nfrom Milne.\n8.5 A Popperian Conclusion\n\nIn the end, the philosophical purity of Bondi\u2019s steady state\ntheory served him, and cosmology, well. Of course, the usual suspect,\nDingle, and others of his ilk, such as McVittie in particular, were\noutraged, and loudly, at Bondi\u2019s extension of Milne\u2019s\nmethods. A passage from Dingle\u2019s R.A.S. Presidential Address\nsuffices to show the tenor of the debate\u2019s declining days:\n\nEven idle speculation may not be quite valueless if it is recognized\nfor what it is. If the new cosmologists would observe this proviso,\ncalling a spade a spade and not a perfect agricultural principle,\none\u2019s only cause for regret would be that such great talents\nwere spent for so little profit. (Dingle 1953, p. 406)\n\n\nBut PCP and the theory which it engendered were exactly as described:\neminently falsifiable. No matter the extent of Dingle et\nal\u2019s disdain, Steady State theory stayed right out in\nfront, ready for whatever empirical observations might be slung at it.\nAs Bondi said \u201cShow me some fossils from an evolving universe,\nand I\u2019ll give it up.\u201d In 1965, the fossils arrived,\ncourtesy of the observations of the 3\u00b0 K remnant microwave\nradiation.\n\nAnd Bondi, true to his philosophy, gave it up.\n",
