    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn the introduction to his recently completed translation of Wars\nof the Lord, Feldman suggests that the significance of Gersonides\nlies in his emphasis upon \u201creligious rationalism in\nJudaism.\u201d According to Feldman, we see a man who \u201chas\ntaken seriously the fact that he has reason, who believes that this\nfaculty is God-given, and who attempts to understand God with this\ninstrument\u201d (Wars, p. 52). Gersonides is the\nphilosopher who attempted to show that philosophy and Torah, that\nreason and revelation are co-extensive; he is a philosophical optimist\nwho believes that reason was fully competent to attain all the\nimportant and essential truths. Thus, according to Feldman, Gersonides\nis \u201ca most vigorous and consistent defender of human reason in\nreligion\u201d(Wars, p. 53).\n\nThis trust is reflected in Gersonides\u2019 introductory remarks to\nWars. There, Gersonides upholds the primacy of reason,\nattributing to Maimonides the position that \u201cwe must believe\nwhat reason has determined to be true. If the literal sense of the\nTorah differs from reason, it is necessary to interpret those passages\nin accordance with the demands of reason\u201d (Wars, p.\n98). Gersonides believes that reason and Torah cannot be in\nopposition: \u201cif reason causes to affirm doctrines that are\nincompatible with the literal sense of Scripture, we are not\nprohibited by the Torah to pronounce the truth on these matters, for\nreason is not incompatible with the true understanding of the\nTorah\u201d (ibid.). Thus reason is upheld as a criterion\nfor achieving truth.\n",
