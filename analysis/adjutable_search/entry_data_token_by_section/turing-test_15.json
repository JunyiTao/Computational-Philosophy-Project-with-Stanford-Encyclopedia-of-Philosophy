    "main_text": "Some Minor Issues Arising || A Further Note\n3.4 A Further Note\n\nIn this article, we follow the standard philosophical convention\naccording to which \u201ca mind\u201d means \u201cat least one\nmind\u201d. If \u201cpassing the Turing Test\u201d implies\nintelligence, then \u201cpassing the Turing Test\u201d implies the\npresence of at least one mind. We cannot here explore recent\ndiscussions of \u201cswarm intelligence\u201d, \u201ccollective\nintelligence\u201d, and the like. However, it is surely clear that\ntwo people taking turns could \u201cpass the Turing Test\u201d in\ncircumstances in which we should be very reluctant to say that there\nis a \u201ccollective mind\u201d that has the minds of the two as\ncomponents.\n",
