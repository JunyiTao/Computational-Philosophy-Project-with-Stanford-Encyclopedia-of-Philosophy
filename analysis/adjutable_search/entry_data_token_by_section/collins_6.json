    "main_text": "Determinism and Free Will || Determinism in Collins\u2019 early works\n3.2 Determinism in Collins\u2019 early works\n\nIn the Clarke Collins correspondence of 1707\u201308 Collins claims\nthat Clarke\u2019s argument for dualism is useless to religion and\nmorality because of the problem of explaining how the immaterial mind\nand the material body interact. One of Clarke\u2019s counter-charges\nis that Collins\u2019 materialism is not just useless but dangerous\nto religion and morality because it implies a determinism that is\ndestructive of religion and morality (Clarke 1738 [1928: 831], Clarke\nand Collins: 192).\n\nCollins claims that human action is caused in much the same way as the\nactions of clocks. Both are necessary agents, though the causes that\nproduce the action, in either case, are very different. \n\n\nBoth are necessarily determined in their Actions: the one by the\nAppearances of Good and Evil, the other by a Weight or Spring. (Clarke\n1738 [1928: 872]; Clarke and Collins 2011: 226) \n\n\nCollins also attacks the free will position. He holds that the same\ncauses will always produce the same effects and claims that the free\nwill explanation of being able to do otherwise violates this basic\nprinciple of causal explanations (Clarke 1738 [1928: 873 and 874];\nClarke and Collins 2011: 227 and 230).\n\nCollins also expressed determinist views in his first\nbook\u2014An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason, 1707. He\ndoes this in the context of the problem of reconciling God\u2019s\nforeknowledge with human free will. As O\u2019Higgins puts it: \n\n\nHe solved the problem to his own satisfaction by saying that all\nthings, including human choices, are determined in their causes and as\nsuch can be foreseen by an all-knowing God. (O\u2019Higgins 1976: 6)\n\n\n\nThis view also plays a role in Collins\u2019 1710 critique of\nArchbishop King\u2019s views about the problem of evil and the\nepistemological status of the attributes of God. King claimed that\nGod\u2019s attributes, including his foreknowledge of events, was\nanalogical. In the case of God\u2019s foreknowledge, he did this to\navoid contradictions between God\u2019s knowing what was to come and\nthe contingency of events and human free will. Collins is content to\nreject human free will and to suppose that \u2018foreknowledge\u2019\nhas a univocal meaning when used with reference to God or humans.\n",
