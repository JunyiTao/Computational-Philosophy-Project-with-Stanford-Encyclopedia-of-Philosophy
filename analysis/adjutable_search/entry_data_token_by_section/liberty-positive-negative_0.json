You turn left, but no one was forcing you to go one way or\nthe other. Next you come to a crossroads. You turn right, but no one\nwas preventing you from going left or straight on. There is no traffic\nto speak of and there are no diversions or police roadblocks. So you\nseem, as a driver, to be completely free. But this picture of your\nsituation might change quite dramatically if we consider that the\nreason you went left and then right is that you\u2019re addicted to\ncigarettes and you\u2019re desperate to get to the tobacconists\nbefore it closes. Rather than driving, you feel you are\nbeing driven, as your urge to smoke leads you uncontrollably\nto turn the wheel first to the left and then to the right. Moreover,\nyou\u2019re perfectly aware that your turning right at the crossroads\nmeans you\u2019ll probably miss a train that was to take you to an\nappointment you care about very much. You long to be free of this\nirrational desire that is not only threatening your longevity but is\nalso stopping you right now from doing what you think you ought to be\ndoing.\n\nThis story gives us two contrasting ways of thinking of liberty. On\nthe one hand, one can think of liberty as the absence of obstacles\nexternal to the agent. You are free if no one is stopping you from\ndoing whatever you might want to do. In the above story you appear, in\nthis sense, to be free. On the other hand, one can think of liberty as\nthe presence of control on the part of the agent. To be free, you must\nbe self-determined, which is to say that you must be able to control\nyour own destiny in your own interests. In the above story you appear,\nin this sense, to be unfree: you are not in control of your own\ndestiny, as you are failing to control a passion that you yourself\nwould rather be rid of and which is preventing you from realizing what\nyou recognize to be your true interests. One might say that while on\nthe first view liberty is simply about how many doors are open to the\nagent, on the second view it is more about going through the right\ndoors for the right reasons.\n\nIn a famous essay first published in 1958, Isaiah Berlin called these\ntwo concepts of liberty negative and positive respectively (Berlin\n 1969).[1]\n The reason for using these labels is that in the first case liberty\nseems to be a mere absence of something (i.e. of obstacles,\nbarriers, constraints or interference from others), whereas in the\nsecond case it seems to require the presence of something\n(i.e. of control, self-mastery, self-determination or\nself-realization). In Berlin\u2019s words, we use the negative\nconcept of liberty in attempting to answer the question \u201cWhat is\nthe area within which the subject \u2014 a person or group of persons\n\u2014 is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be,\nwithout interference by other persons?\u201d, whereas we use the\npositive concept in attempting to answer the question \u201cWhat, or\nwho, is the source of control or interference that can determine\nsomeone to do, or be, this rather than that?\u201d (1969, pp.\n121\u201322).\n\nIt is useful to think of the difference between the two concepts in\nterms of the difference between factors that are external and factors\nthat are internal to the agent. While theorists of negative freedom\nare primarily interested in the degree to which individuals or groups\nsuffer interference from external bodies, theorists of positive\nfreedom are more attentive to the internal factors affecting the\ndegree to which individuals or groups act autonomously. Given this\ndifference, one might be tempted to think that a political philosopher\nshould concentrate exclusively on negative freedom, a concern with\npositive freedom being more relevant to psychology or individual\nmorality than to political and social institutions. This, however,\nwould be premature, for among the most hotly debated issues in\npolitical philosophy are the following: Is the positive\nconcept of freedom a political concept? Can individuals or groups\nachieve positive freedom through political action? Is it possible for\nthe state to promote the positive freedom of citizens on their behalf?\nAnd if so, is it desirable for the state to do so? The classic texts\nin the history of western political thought are divided over how these\nquestions should be answered: theorists in the classical liberal\ntradition, like Benjamin Constant, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Herbert\nSpencer, and J.S. Mill, are typically classed as answering\n\u2018no\u2019 and therefore as defending a negative concept of\npolitical freedom; theorists that are critical of this tradition, like\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx and T.H. Green, are\ntypically classed as answering \u2018yes\u2019 and as defending a\npositive concept of political freedom.\n\nIn its political form, positive freedom has often been thought of as\nnecessarily achieved through a collectivity. Perhaps the clearest case\nis that of Rousseau\u2019s theory of freedom, according to which\nindividual freedom is achieved through participation in the process\nwhereby one\u2019s community exercises collective control over its\nown affairs in accordance with the \u2018general will\u2019. Put in\nthe simplest terms, one might say that a democratic society is a free\nsociety because it is a self-determined society, and that a member of\nthat society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its\ndemocratic process. But there are also individualist applications of\nthe concept of positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said\nthat a government should aim actively to create the conditions\nnecessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve\nself-realization. The welfare state has sometimes been defended on\nthis basis, as has the idea of a universal basic income. The negative\nconcept of freedom, on the other hand, is most commonly assumed in\nliberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of\nliberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of\nreligion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist\nor moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences\nof the right to private property. This said, some philosophers have\ncontested the claim that private property necessarily enhances\nnegative liberty (Cohen 1995, 2006), and still others have tried to\nshow that negative liberty can ground a form of egalitarianism\n(Steiner 1994).\n\nAfter Berlin, the most widely cited and best developed analyses of the\nnegative concept of liberty include Hayek (1960), Day (1971),\nOppenheim (1981), Miller (1983) and Steiner (1994). Among the most\nprominent contemporary analyses of the positive concept of liberty are\nMilne (1968), Gibbs (1976), C. Taylor (1979) and Christman (1991,\n2005).\n",
