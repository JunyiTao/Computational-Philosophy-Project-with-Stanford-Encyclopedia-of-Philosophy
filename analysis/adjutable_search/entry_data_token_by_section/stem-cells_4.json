The Ethics of Using Human Embryonic Stem Cells in Research\n\n\nAssume for the sake of argument that it is morally impermissible to\ndestroy human embryos. It does not follow that all research with HESCs\nis impermissible, as it is sometimes permissible to benefit from moral\nwrongs. For example, there is nothing objectionable about\ntransplant surgeons and patients benefiting from the organs of murder\nand drunken driving victims (Robertson 1988). If there are\nconditions under which a researcher may use HESCs without being\ncomplicit in the destruction of embryos, then those who oppose the\ndestruction of embryos could support research with HESCs under certain\ncircumstances.\n\n\nResearchers using HESCs are clearly implicated in the destruction of\nembryos where they derive the cells themselves or enlist others to\nderive the cells. However, most investigators who conduct\nresearch with HESCs obtain them from an existing pool of cell lines and\nplay no role in their derivation. One view is that we cannot assign\ncausal or moral responsibility to investigators for the destruction of\nembryos from which the HESCs they use are derived where their\n\u201cresearch plans had no effect on whether the original immoral\nderivation occurred.\u201d (Robertson 1999). This view\nrequires qualification. There may be cases in which HESCs are\nderived for the express purpose of making them widely available to HESC\ninvestigators. In such instances, it may be that no individual\nresearcher\u2019s plans motivated the derivation of the cells.\nNonetheless, one might argue that investigators who use these cells are\ncomplicit in the destruction of the embryos from which the cells were\nderived because they are participants in a research enterprise that\ncreates a demand for HESCs. For these investigators to avoid the charge\nof complicity in the destruction of embryos, it must be the case that\nthe researchers who derived the HESCs would have performed the\nderivation in the absence of external demand for the cells (Siegel\n2004).\n\n\nThe issue about complicity goes beyond the question of an HESC\nresearcher\u2019s role in the destruction of the particular human\nembryo(s) from which the cells he or she uses are derived. There\nis a further concern that research with existing HESCs will result in\nthe future destruction of embryos: \u201c[I]f this research\nleads to possible treatments, private investment in such efforts will\nincrease greatly and the demand for many thousands of cell lines with\ndifferent genetic profiles will be difficult to resist.\u201d (U.S.\nConference of Catholic Bishops 2001). This objection faces two\ndifficulties. First, it appears to be too sweeping:\nresearch with adult stem cells and non-human animal stem cells, as well\nas general research in genetics, embryology, and cell biology could be\nimplicated, since all of this research might advance our understanding\nof HESCs and result in increased demand for them. Yet, no one,\nincluding those who oppose HESC research, argues that we should not\nsupport these areas of research. Second, the claim about future\ndemand for HESCs is speculative. Indeed, current HESC research\ncould ultimately reduce or eliminate demand for the cells by providing\ninsights into cell biology that enable the use of alternative sources\nof cells (Siegel 2004). \n\n\nWhile it might thus be possible for a researcher to use HESCs\nwithout being morally responsible for the destruction of human embryos,\nthat does not end the inquiry into complicity. Some argue that\nagents can be complicit in wrongful acts for which they are not morally\nresponsible. One such form of complicity arises from an\nassociation with wrongdoing that symbolizes acquiescence in the\nwrongdoing (Burtchaell 1989). The failure to take\nappropriate measures to distance oneself from moral wrongs may give\nrise to \u201cmetaphysical guilt,\u201d which produces a moral taint\nand for which shame is the appropriate response (May 1992).\nThe following question thus arises: Assuming it is morally\nwrongful to destroy human embryos, are HESC researchers who are not\nmorally responsible for the destruction of embryos complicit in the\nsense of symbolically aligning themselves with a wrongful act?\n\n\nOne response is that a researcher who benefits from the destruction\nof embryos need not sanction the act any more than the transplant\nsurgeon who uses the organs of a murder or drunken driving victim\nsanctions the homicidal act (Curzer 2004). But this response\nis unlikely to be satisfactory to opponents of HESC research.\nThere is arguably an important difference between the transplant case\nand HESC research insofar as the moral wrong associated with the latter\n(a) systematically devalues a particular class of human beings and (b)\nis largely socially accepted and legally permitted. Opponents of HESC\nresearch might suggest that the HESC research case is more analogous to\nthe following kind of case: Imagine a society in which the\npractice of killing members of a particular racial or ethnic group is\nlegally permitted and generally accepted. Suppose that biological\nmaterials obtained from these individuals subsequent to their deaths\nare made available for research uses. Could researchers use these\nmaterials while appropriately distancing themselves from the wrongful\npractice? Arguably, they could not. There is a heightened\nneed to protest moral wrongs where those wrongs are socially and\nlegally accepted. Attempts to benefit from the moral wrong in these\ncircumstances may be incompatible with mounting a proper protest\n(Siegel 2003).\n\n\nBut even if we assume that HESC researchers cannot avoid the taint\nof metaphysical guilt, it is not clear that researchers who bear no\nmoral responsibility for the destruction of embryos are morally\nobligated not to use HESCs. One might argue that there is a prima\nfacie duty to avoid moral taint, but that this duty may be overridden\nfor the sake of a noble cause.\n",
