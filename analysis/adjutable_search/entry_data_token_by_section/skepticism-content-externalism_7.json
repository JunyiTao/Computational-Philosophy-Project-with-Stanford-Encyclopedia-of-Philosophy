Reconstructions Based on Self-Knowledge.\n\nSo far, all of the reconstructions of Putnam\u2019s anti-skeptical\nargument that we have considered have involved, in various ways, the\nuse of disquotation. But one remaining type of reconstruction does not\ninvolve the use of disquotation at all. (A major advantage, some might\nsay.) Rather, these arguments depend on the thesis that one can know\na priori that one\u2019s thoughts have a given content, even\nwhen that content has an externalist semantics. Arguments of this sort\nhave the following form:\n\n(F)\n (p1)\nI am thinking that P. (By privileged a\npriori access to content.)\n\n (p2)\n \nIf I am a BIV, then I am not thinking that P. (By\nPutnam\u2019s causal constraint.)\n\n \u2234\u00a0\nC \n I am not a BIV.\n\n\nArguments of this form have been discussed and defended by Tymoczko\n1989, Warfield 1998, and Brueckner 2003, 2005, 2016. I will rely on\nWarfield\u2019s argument of form (F), which is:\n\n(W)\n (p1)\nI think that water is wet.\n\n (p2)\n \nNo brain in a vat in an otherwise empty world can\nthink that water is wet.\n\n \n\u2234\u00a0 C \n I am not a brain in a vat. (1998:\n78)\n\n\n(Warfield explains that an \u201cotherwise empty world\u201d is\n\u201ca world containing only the brain in a vat and whatever is\nnecessary to sustain the brain in a vat\u201d (1998: 77).)\n\nWarfield suggests that one major advantage of his argument (W) is that\nit appears to avoid the charge of question-begging that (as\nwe\u2019ve seen) is so often made against other forms of Putnamian\nanti-skeptical argument. (A similar motivation is also suggested by\nBrueckner 2016: 5.) This is because, Warfield says, he can justify a\nclaim to have a priori knowledge of both of the\nargument\u2019s premises: premise 2 on the basis of externalist\nthought experiments by Putnam and others; premise 1 by virtue of the\nprinciple that one can always have a priori knowledge of the\ncontents of one\u2019s thoughts (pp. 78, 80).\n\nBy \u2018a priori knowledge\u2019 Warfield means knowledge\nthat is obtained without either perceptual observation or empirical\ninvestigation (1998: 80; see also McKinsey 1991). Warfield\u2019s\nview then is that one can always have privileged a priori\nknowledge of the propositional contents of one\u2019s thoughts (the\ntraditional principle of privileged access), even when these contents\nare external or wide, in the sense that having a thought with\nthat content logically implies the existence of particular\nobjects or substances that are external to the agent (see the useful\nentry by Gertler 2017 on\n self-knowledge).\n\nThus Warfield\u2019s attempt to defend the claim that he has a\npriori knowledge of both premises of his anti-skeptical argument\ncommits him to a view that we will call content\ncompatibilism, the view that having privileged access to the\ncontents of one\u2019s thoughts is consistent with some of those\ncontents being externalist, or wide. Other proposals of anti-skeptical\narguments of the form (F), such as those by Tymoczko and Brueckner,\nalso commit their defenders to content compatibilism.\n\nBut content compatibilism is a controversial view. Some have\ncomplained that it implies that we can have a priori\nknowledge of far too many things (see McKinsey 1991 and 2002).\nConsider for instance the case of Garrison, who thinks that Donald is\nclueless, so that the following thought ascription is true:\n\n(G) Garrison thinks\nthat Donald is clueless.\n\n\nOn the direct reference view of names, (G) ascribes to Garrison a\nthought that has as its wide content the singular proposition that\nDonald is clueless. This content is wide in the sense that (with the\nexception of Donald) anyone\u2019s having a thought with this content\nlogically implies the existence of things or substances that are\nexternal to that person. In this case of course, the relevant external\nobject or substance is Donald.\n\nNow given the principle of privileged access, Garrison can know a\npriori that he thinks that Donald is clueless. But as we\u2019ve\njust seen, it is a logical consequence of Garrison\u2019s having this\nthought that Donald exists. Hence, Garrison can merely deduce\nthat Donald exists from something he knows a priori, and thus\nhe can know a priori that Donald exists. But this consequence\nis absurd. Surely no one can know that any given other person exists\nwithout perceptual observation or empirical investigation. (A similar\nargument can be given for thought contents expressed by use of\nindexical pronouns and natural kind terms.)\n\nI take this argument to be a reductio of content\ncompatibilism: one of these two principles, privileged access and\ncontent externalism, must be false. One who endorses content\nexternalism should I think endorse a restricted form of privileged\naccess on which we can have privileged access only to the\nnarrow contents of our thoughts (see McKinsey 2002).\n\nGiven content externalism, then, Warfield cannot have the desired\na priori knowledge of premise 1 (\u201cI think that water is\nwet\u201d). Does this mean that his use of premise 1 begs the\nquestion? Apparently so. Certainly, from a Putnamian point of view,\nthe question is begged. For on that point of view, one could not have\nwarrant for premise 1 unless one had warrant to believe that (unlike a\nBIV) one had satisfied the causal constraints on having the concept\nwater. Thus it would seem that\u2014absent any a priori\nknowledge of premise 1\u2014one could not have warrant to believe\npremise 1 unless one already had warrant to believe that one is a\nnon-BIV. (McLaughlin 2000 and Steup 2003 also contend that\nWarfield\u2019s argument begs the question.)\n",
