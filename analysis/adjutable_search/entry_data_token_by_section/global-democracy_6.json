    "main_text": "Models of Global Democracy || World Government\n2.3 World Government\n\n\nA world government has also been seen as a potential response to the\nglobal democratic deficit. Scholarship on world government has a long\nhistory in academia and social commentary: Hugo Grotius, Jeremy\nBentham and Abb\u00e9 de Saint-Pierre in the former camp; Albert\nEinstein, HG Wells, and Martin Luther King in the latter. Recently,\nthe concept has seen a revival in the work of Luis Cabrera (2004),\nAndrew Kuper (2004), Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 (2008), and\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (2006). World government proposals are justified\nin terms of both intrinsic and instrumental concerns. On the intrinsic\nside, world government advocates take a cosmopolitan stance and demand\nequal respect for all individuals. As such, individuals should have\nequal say in how transnational rules are formed to reduce the global\ndemocratic deficit. This intrinsic claim is often coupled with\njustice-based arguments concerning a fairer distribution of resources\n(Marchetti 2008). On the instrumental side, those such as\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 (2008) contend that a world government is necessary\nto overcome global problems such as war and ecological disaster.\n\n\nWorld government proponents seek a highly centralized and federal\nglobal system. As Cabrera (2004, 71) notes, a world government would\nrequire a \u201crestructuring of the global system to bring states\nunder the authority of just supranational institutions.\u201d A\ncentral government would sit at the core with autonomous and coercive\ndecision-making potential. As with cosmopolitan democracy, a world\ngovernment would also entail a directly-elected global parliament,\nempowered courts, and a singular global constitution which explicates\nbasic rights and duties for all. In many cases, proponents stipulate\nthat a world government could come about through a major recalibration\nof the United Nations General Assembly. Famously, Habermas has also\nargued for a three-tiered hierarchical global system in which\nsupranational, transnational, and national institutions are\nimplemented to secure rights, peace, and global democracy. Although\nHabermas might deny advocating a world government, William Scheuerman\n(2008, 148) argues that Habermas\u2019s attempt to pursue stronger\nsupranational governance combined with a global constitution would\nhave that result.\n\n\nDespite Alexander Wendt\u2019s (2003) teleological claim that a world\ngovernment is \u2018inevitable\u2019, many people deride the concept\nas infeasible. Without another major crisis (such as a world war) to\nprompt international action, it is difficult to envisage why states\nwould readily give sovereign power to a global state and who precisely\nwould take the lead in this process. Although UN reform is often cited\nas one pathway forward, the veto position held in the Security Council\nby the United States, China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom\nundermines that option. From the perspective of desirability,\nmoreover, opponents have argued that a world government would actually\nexacerbate the global democratic deficit. For example, Kant argued\nthat a world government would become a \u2018soulless\ndespotism\u2019 as global leaders abused their power without\nappropriate checks and balances. Other scholars have also suggested a\nworld government\u2014in which citizens have one vote from a\nconstituency of seven billion\u2014would be essentially meaningless\nand not enable individuals to participate meaningfully in their\ncollective governance.\n",
