    "main_text": "Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance\n7. Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance\n\nInvestigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to a\nseries of papers on preference, utility, and demand from 1982 onwards;\nsee Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral thesis, Hendtlass [2013]\nsubstantially weakened the conditions for the existence of a demand\nfunction; he also produced a wealth of results in fixed-point theory\nand its applications, in particular to constructivisations of two\nclassical proofs of the existence of an economic equilibrium.\n\nIn 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on constructive\nmathematical finance, at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in\nMunich.They first showed that the fundamental theorem on asset\npricing, the separating hyperplane theorem, and Markov\u2019s\nPrinciple are constructively equivalent (Berger & Svindland\n[2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how to circumvent\nthe nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value theorem in order\nto prove the existence of extreme points for functions in the presence\nof even relatively weak convexity properties (Berger & Svindland\n[2016a]). Their project suggests that mathematical finance, like\nmathematical economics, may be a rich source of elegant, practical\nconstructive theorems.\n",
