    "main_text": "Embodied Cognition: Themes and Close Relations || Enactive Cognition\n2.4 Enactive Cognition\n\n\nEnactivism is the view that cognition emerges from or is constituted\nby sensorimotor activity. Currently, there are three distinct strands\nof enactivism (Ward, Silverman, and Villalobos 2017). Autopoietic\nEnactivism conceives of cognition in terms of the biodynamics of living\nsystems (Varela, Thompson, and Rosch 2017; Di Paolo 2005). Just as a\nbacterium is created and maintained by processes that span the organism\nand environment, so too is cognition generated and specified through\noperation of sensorimotor processes that crisscross the brain, body,\nand world. On this version of enactivism, there is no bright line\nbetween mental processes and non-mental biological processes. The\nformer simply are an enriched version of the latter. Sensorimotor\nEnactivism is another strand of enactivism that focuses on explaining\nthe intentionality and phenomenology of perceptual experiences in\nparticular (O'Regan and No\u00eb 2001; No\u00eb 2004). This view holds\nthat perception consists in active exploration of the environment,\nwhich establishes patterns of dependence between our movements, sensory\nstates, and the world. Perceivers need not build and manipulate\ninternal models of the external world. Instead, they need only\nskillfully exploit sensorimotor dependences that their exploratory\nactivities reveal. Finally, Radical Enactivism aims to replace all\nrepresentational explanations of cognition with embodied, interactive\nexplanations (Hutto and Myin 2013; Chemero 2011). The primary tactic\nguiding Radical Enactivism is to deconstruct and eliminate the notion\nof mental content in cognitive science. This tactic manifests in\ncritiques of attempts to naturalize intentionality, redescribing\ncognitive processes studied in mainstream cognitive science, and\nchallenging concepts employed even by closely related views, such as\nAutopoietic Enactivism\u2019s notion of sensemaking (Chemero 2016).\nThese three strands of enactivism vary in their target explanations and\nmethodology, however they share the commitment to the idea that\ncognition emerges from sensorimotor activity.\n",
