    "main_text": "Arguments from Ethical Supervenience || Supervenience and anti-realism\n3.3 Supervenience and anti-realism\n\nAs\n Section 3.1\n explained, supervenience arguments were initially used by Mackie and\nBlackburn to raise doubts about ethical realism. Indeed, it has been\nwidely assumed that the realist faces a challenge here that the\nanti-realist does not. The issues here are complicated, and it will be\nhelpful to consider common varieties of ethical anti-realism\nseparately.\n\nFirst, consider ethical nihilism, the thesis that there are\nno ethical properties. The ethical nihilist might seem to have an easy\ntime explaining the metaphysical supervenience of the ethical: if\nthere are no ethical properties, there are, trivially, no ethical\ndifferences. And if there are no ethical differences, there are no\nethical differences without base differences.\n\nThis line of reasoning is too quick as it stands. Supervenience is a\nmodal claim, so contingent ethical nihilism\u2014the thesis\nthat there are no actually instantiated ethical\nproperties\u2014cannot explain ethical supervenience. Indeed, as\nChristian Coons (2011) has shown, it is possible to use supervenience\nto construct an interesting argument against contingent\nnihilism. A crucial question here is: what is the modality of the\nsupervenience thesis to be accounted for? If the supervenience thesis\nwe need to explain is conceptual, then even the truth of\nnon-contingent nihilism\u2014the thesis that it is\nmetaphysically impossible for ethical properties to be\ninstantiated\u2014would not do the relevant explanatory work. Only\nthe thesis that the instantiation of ethical properties is\nconceptually impossible would suffice. (Note that the\nnihilist might be able to adapt one of the realist replies to\nBlackburn discussed in\n Section 3.1,\n but in this case it would not be easier for the nihilist to\nexplain supervenience, than it is for the realist who adopts the same\nreply.)\n\nThe nihilist imagined above does not question the assumption that\nordinary ethical thought and talk commits us to ontological claims.\nOther ethical anti-realists, however, will deny this assumption (for\ndiscussion, see the entries on\n moral anti-realism\n and\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism).\n Consider two examples of such views.\n\nFirst, hermeneutic fictionalists about ethical thought and\ntalk argue that such thought and talk is to be understood as a form of\npretense or fictional discourse (see Kalderon 2005 for discussion and\ndefense). It will be natural for the hermeneutic fictionalist to\nreject ordinary ethical supervenience claims as misleading. However,\nthey will presumably still need to account for the considerations that\nlead other philosophers to accept ethical supervenience claims. The\nissues concerning ethical fictionalism and supervenience are\ncomparatively unexplored; see (Nolan, Restall, and West 2005,\n325\u2013327) for important preliminary discussion.\n\nSecond (and much more influentially) some non-cognitivists\nabout ethical thought and talk deny that our ethical claims express\nbeliefs about the ethical nature of the world, suggesting instead that\nthey express desire-like mental states. Such a view may make\nontological supervenience claims about ethics appear misleading at\nbest. More interesting is the question of what non-cognitivists can\nsay about the sort of ascriptive supervenience thesis discussed in\n  Section 1.4:\n\nAscriptive\n\nAnyone who treats apparently base-identical circumstances as ethically\ndifferent from each other thereby makes a mistake.\n\n\nThis thesis is an alleged correctness constraint on ethical thought\nand talk. Prominent philosophers in the non-cognitivist tradition\n(broadly understood) have characteristically claimed that their views\nenabled them to explain theses like Ascriptive.\n\nConsider a representative sample of these explanations. R. M. Hare\nclaims that ascriptive supervenience holds because a significant part\nof the function of moralizing is to teach others our ethical\nstandards, and the only way to do that is to get our audience to see\nthe recognizable pattern that we are prescribing that they follow\n(1952, 134). According to Simon Blackburn, the presumption of\nascriptive supervenience is required by the idea that our ethical\nattitudes are supposed to be practical guides to decision-making\n(1984, 186). According to Allan Gibbard (2003, Ch. 5), ascriptive\nsupervenience for ethical thought is explained by a consistency norm\non planning states.\n\nCritics of non-cognitivism (e.g. Zangwill 1997, 110\u201311; Sturgeon\n2009) have challenged the rationales offered by Hare and Blackburn.\nSuppose that we grant that consistency is useful, given the various\nfunctions of ethical discourse. It is unclear why this usefulness\nshould force on us a conceptual truth about moral discourse.\nFurther, it is arguable that all that is required for these practical\npurposes is consistency within worlds that are very similar to the\nactual world. So the idea that such consistency is required over every\npossible world (as seems to be the case for ethical supervenience)\nseems like considerably more than the practical considerations\nrequire. Gibbard\u2019s rationale has faced related criticism: why\nmust planners be committed to consistency in the sweeping way that\nGibbard envisions (Chrisman 2005, 411\u201312; Sturgeon 2009,\n84\u201387)? If these critics are right, it is not clear that the\nnon-cognitivist has an especially compelling explanation of ethical\nsupervenience. And if they do not, this will complicate their efforts\nto claim that explaining ethical supervenience is a dialectical\nadvantage against cognitivism. It is also worth bearing in mind that\nthe details of which ethical supervenience thesis we need to explain\ncan affect how promising the non-cognitivist explanations will be. For\nan important illustration of this point, see (Atiq 2019).\n\nA further complication arises from the fact that leading contemporary\nheirs of non-cognitivism (such as Blackburn and Gibbard) have\nabandoned anti-realism. Instead, they have adopted what Simon\nBlackburn (e.g. 1993) has dubbed the \u2018quasi-realist\u2019\nprogram. This involves the claim that one can, while beginning with\nthe non-cognitivist\u2019s framework, \u201cearn the right\u201d to\nrealist-sounding claims about ethical truth and objectivity (for\nfurther discussion see the section on noncognitivism in the entry on\n moral anti-realism).\n\nNow consider an ontological supervenience claim: that there can be no\ndifference in ethical properties without a difference in base\nproperties. The quasi-realist program can seem to commit the\nquasi-realist to accepting this claim. Dreier (2015) argues that this\nleads to a further challenge to the non-cognitivist: even if\nshe can explain ascriptive supervenience, it is not clear that she can\nexplain ontological supervenience. If this is the case, the most\ninfluential contemporary non-cognitivists may find that supervenience\nis a dialectical burden rather than benefit.\n",
