    "main_text": "Cinematic Approaches || Dynamic Snapshots\n3.2 Dynamic Snapshots\n\nCinematic theorists would be on stronger ground if they could supply a\nplausible explanation as to why we believe we perceive motion\n(and more generally, change) if in fact we do not. Le Poidevin (2007:\n88\u201392) tentatively forwards a promising hypothesis. As Aristotle\nnoted, if you stare at a waterfall for a short period, and then turn\nyour gaze to the bank beside it, you will see part of the bank\n(seemingly) start to move in an upwards direction. This phenomenon is\ncommonly called \u201cthe waterfall illusion\u201d (or motion\naftereffect), and the illusory motion is of an intriguing sort:\nalthough parts of the bank seem to flow upward, they do so without\nseeming to change their location with respect to the rest of the\nbank.\n\nAs for an explanation of what is going on in such cases, Le Poidevin\n(following Richard Gregory) suggests that perhaps we can discern here\nthe workings of two distinct neural mechanisms. One\n\n\nregisters what we might call \u201cpure motion\u201d, i.e., gives\nrise to the impression of motion without any associated sense of\nchange of position. (2007: 89)\n\n\nA second system, relying on short-term memory, tracks and compares the\nalterations in location over time. This second system is not concerned\nwith telling us about presently occurring motions, rather it gives\nrise to the sense that objects have changed their positions relative\nto one another. Hence Le Poidevin\u2019s proposal: perhaps our\nordinary experience of motion does, after all, consist of nothing but\nmomentary static snapshots but these momentary experiences\nseem dynamic thanks to the activation of the \u201cpure\nmotion\u201d mechanism in our visual system.\n\nThis is a more promising line for the cinematic theorist to take, and\nit has recently been endorsed by Arstila (2018), and also been taken\nup by Prosser, where pure motion plays an important role in his\ndynamic snapshot theory:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a \u201csnapshot\u201d theory because it accounts for\nthe experience of motion without appeal to a specious present, but it\nis very different from the cinematic or \u201cstatic snapshot\u201d\ntheory. I agree with those who hold that the latter theory cannot\nadequately account for the phenomenology of motion experience. (2017:\n149, see also Prosser 2016: \u00a75.4)\n\n\nThis supposedly dynamic version of the cinematic view may be more\npromising than the static alternative, but it has also come under fire\nfrom a number of directions. McKenna argues thus:\n\n\nFor the experienced illusory object \u2026 to appear static in\nspace, but with motion-like properties, it must exhibit persistence\nover some length of time. temporality is inescapable; events continue\nto succeed one another over time, even if the content remains the\nsame. (2021: \u00a76)\n\n\nShardlow makes a similar complaint:\n\n\nContrary to what Prosser and Arstila suggest, it simply does not\nfollow that the experience of motion is not in and of itself something\nwith a fundamentally temporally extended phenomenology, and that\nmotion/change as it is experienced seems processive\u2026. (2019:\n745)\n\n\nIt may well be a mistake to focus exclusively on the case of vision:\nafter all, in addition to being seen, change can be heard, smelt,\ntasted, felt in bodily sensations, remembered, imagined and thought\nabout. Even if the existence of the envisaged twin-track neural\nsystems could be established in the visual case, critics point out\nthat as things currently stand there is no reason for thinking Arstila\nis correct when he proposes that there are a range of different\nencapsulated systems, one for each of the other forms of temporal\nexperience. On the contrary: if, as has seemed plausible to many,\nall forms of consciousness possess a dynamic temporal\ncharacter then it is natural to conclude that temporality is closely\nconnected with the neural processes that are responsible for\nconsciousness itself:\n\n\nWhy adopt the encapsulated mechanism approach when it is simpler, more\nexplanatory, and truer to the phenomena to locate temporality as a\nfeature of a general mechanism responsible for consciousness, whatever\nthat may be? A feature of a general mechanism also has the benefit of\naccounting for why people never seem to go \u201ctimeless\u201d the\nway people go \u201cblind\u201d\u2014temporality is indispensable\nto consciousness because it is inextricably bound up with the\nprocesses responsible for it. (McKenna 2021: \u00a75)\n\n\nMcKenna suggests that the future-oriented predictive processing\nproposal from Hohwy, Paton, and Palmer (2015) fits the bill. An\nalternative general neuro-scientific mechanism is proposed by Piper\n(2019), who points to the merits of the re-entrant oscillatory\nmultiplexing (ROM) neurodynamical model. On the latter view the\ntemporal features of consciousness are the product of interlocking and\ninterdependent waves of neural activity that are extended through time\nin a manner that is difficult to reconcile with the cinematic view in\nany of its guises but eminently compatible with rival extensional\nmodels. Just as\n\n\nmusic is a product of various auditory resonances (in rhythm,\npitch and timbre, for example) amongst the parts of the active\norchestra. Analogously the ROM model formalizes the idea that coherent\nmental representations and experience is the product of various\nresonances (i.e. multiplexing) between the phases, frequencies and\namplitude parameters \u2026 of reciprocally connected\ninformation-processing (i.e. reentrant) brain circuits. (Piper 2019:\n9\u201310)\n\n\nIn a similar general vein Northoff (2016) and Northoff and Huang\n(2017) argue that the temporal features of consciousness are\ninextricably bound up with continuous neural oscillations that are\nextend through time in a continuous manner. These \u201cslow cortical\npulses\u201d are low frequency waves of neural activity that allow\nthe brain to unify stimuli that are temporally separated. This\nposition also runs counter to cinematic conceptions but gels neatly\nwith extensionalism.\n",
