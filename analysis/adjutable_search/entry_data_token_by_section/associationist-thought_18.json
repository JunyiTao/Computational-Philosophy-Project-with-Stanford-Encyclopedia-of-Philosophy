Put a different way, one needs a principle\nto say what the \u201csame situation\u201d amounts to in\ngeneralizations such as Thorndike\u2019s laws. For instance, if a CS\nand a US, say a tone and a shock, are perfectly paired so that they\nare either both present or both absent, the organism won\u2019t\nassociate the location it received shocks (e.g., the experimental\nsetting) with getting shocked, it will just associate the tone with\nthe shocks. But in the condition where the US occurs without the CS,\nbut the CS does not occur without the US, the organism will gain an\nassociation between the shocks and the location. However, in both\ncases the location is present on every trial.[37] In contrast to shocks,\nx-ray radiation, when used as a US, never appears to become\nassociated with location, even if they are always perfectly paired\n (Garcia et al. \n1972).[38]\nThe problem of saying which properties become associated when\nmultiple properties are coinstantiated sometimes goes by the name the\n\u201cCredit Assignment Problem\u201d (see, e.g., Gallistel and\n King 2009).[39]\nSome would argue that this problem is a symptom of a larger issue:\ntrying to use extensional criteria to specify intentional content\n(see, e.g., Fodor 2003). Associationists need a criterion to specify which\nof the coextensive properties will in fact be learned, and which\nnot.\nAn additional worry stems from the observation that sometimes the\nlack of a property being instantiated is an integral component of\nwhat is learned. To deal with the problem of missing properties,\ncontemporary associationists have introduced an important element to\nthe theory: inhibition. For example, if a US and a CS only appear\nwhen the other is absent, the organism will learn a negative\nrelationship holds between them; that is, the organism will learn\nthat the absence of the CS predicts the\n US.[40] Here\nthe CS becomes a \u201cconditioned inhibitor\u201d of the US.\nInhibition, using associations as modulators and not just activators,\nis a central part of current associationist thinking. For example, in\nconnectionist networks, inhibition is implemented by the activation\nof certain nodes inhibiting the activation of other nodes. Connection\nweights can be positive or negative, with the negative weight\nstanding in for the inhibitory strength of the association.\n",
