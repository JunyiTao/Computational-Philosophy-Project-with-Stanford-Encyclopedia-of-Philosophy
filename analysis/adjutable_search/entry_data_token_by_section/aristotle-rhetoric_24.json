    "main_text": "Style: How to Say Things with Words || The Virtue of Style\n8.1 The Virtue of Style\n\nOriginally the discussion of style belongs to the art of poetry rather\nthan to rhetoric; the poets were the first, as Aristotle observes, to\ngive an impulse for the study of style. Nevertheless he admits that\nquestions of style or, more precisely, of different ways to formulate\nthe same subject, may have an impact on the degree of clarity:\n\u201cWhat concerns the topic of lexis, however, has some\nsmall necessary place in all teaching; for to speak in one way rather\nthan another makes some difference in regard to clarity; although not\na great difference\u2026\u201d (Rhet. III.1,\n1404a8\u201310). Clarity again matters for comprehension and\ncomprehensibility contributes to persuasiveness. Indeed Aristotle even\nclaims that the virtue or excellence (aret\u00ea) of prose\nstyle ultimately depends on clarity, because it is the genuine purpose\nof a speech is to make something clear. In prose speeches, the good\nformulation of a state of affairs must therefore be a clear one.\nHowever, saying this is not yet enough to account for the best or\nexcellent prose style, since clear linguistic expressions tend to be\nbanal or flat, while good style should avoid such banality. If the\nlanguage becomes too banal it will not be able to attract the\nattention of the audience. The orator can avoid this tendency of\nbanality by the use of dignified or elevated expressions and in\ngeneral by all formulations that deviate from common usage. On the one\nhand, uncommon vocabulary has the advantage of evoking the curiosity\nof an audience. On the other hand the use of such elevated vocabulary\nbears a serious risk: Whenever the orator makes excessive use of it,\nthe speech might become unclear, thus failing to meet the default\nrequirement of prose speech, namely clarity. Moreover, if the\nvocabulary becomes too sublime or dignified in relation to\nprose\u2019s subject matter (Aristotle assumes it is mostly everyday\naffairs), the audience will notice that the orator uses his words with\na certain intention and will become suspicious about the orator and\nhis intentions. Hitting upon the right wording is therefore a matter\nof being clear, but not too banal; In trying not to be too banal, one\nmust use uncommon, dignified words and phrases, but one must be\ncareful not to use them excessively or inappropriately in relation to\nprose style and the typical subject matter of prose speeches.\n\nBringing all these considerations together, Aristotle defines the good\nprose style, i.e. the virtue of prose style, as follows: \u201cLet\nthe virtue of linguistic form be defined as being clear, for since the\nlogos is a (linguistic, sc.) sign, it would fail to bring about its\nproper function, whenever it does not make clear (whatever it is the\nsign of, sc.)\u2014and neither banal/mean/flat\n(tapein\u00ean) nor above the deserved dignity, but\nappropriate (prepon)\u201d (Rhet. III.2,\n1404b1\u20134; similar at III.12, 1414a22\u201326). According to this\ndefinition, the virtue of prose style has to avoid two opposed\ntendencies, both of which are excessive and therefore fallacious: The\ngood style is clear in a way that is neither too banal nor too\ndignified, but appropriate (in proportion to the subject matter of\nprose speech). In this respect the definition of stylistic virtue\nfollows the same scheme as the definition of ethical virtues in\nAristotle\u2019s ethical writings, insofar as both the stylistic\nvirtue and the virtue of character are defined in terms of a mean that\nlies between two opposed excesses. If the virtue of style is defined\nas a mean between the banality involving form of clarity and overly\ndignified (and hence inappropriate) speech, it is with good reason\nthat Aristotle speaks of only one virtue of prose style, and not of\nclarity, ornament (by dignified expressions) and appropriateness as\nthree distinct virtues of style. However, from the times of Cicero and\nQuintilianus on, these three, along with the correctness of Greek or\nLatin, became the canonical four virtues of speech (virtutes\ndicendi). Reading Aristotle through the spectacles of the Roman\nart of rhetoric, scholars often try to identify two, three or four\nvirtues of style in his Rhetoric.\n\nFinally, if the virtue of style is about finding a balance between\nbanal clarity, which is dull, and attractive dignity, which is\ninappropriate in public speeches, how can the orator manage to control\nthe different degrees of clarity and dignity? For this purpose\nAristotle equips the orator with a classification of words (more or\nless the same classification can also be found in Poetics\nchapter 21): First of all Aristotle distinguishes between the\nkuria onamata, the standard expressions, and the\ngl\u00f4tta, the borrowed words, idioms or vernacular\nexpressions. Most examples that Aristotle gives of this latter class\nare taken from the different Greek dialects, and most examples of this\ntype are in turn taken from the language of the Homeric epos. Further\nclasses are defined by metaphors and by several expressions that are\nsomehow altered or modified, e.g., newly coined expressions\n(pepoi\u00eamena), composite expressions (especially new or\nunusual compositions (ta dipla)), and lengthened, shortened\nor otherwise altered expressions. Sometimes Aristotle also uses the\nterm kosmos under which he collects all epithets and\notherwise ornamental expressions. These different types of words\ndiffer in accordance with their familiarity. Most familiar are the\nusual or current words, the least familiar words are the\ngl\u00f4tta or words that are newly coined. The metaphors\nare also unknown and unusual, because a usual, well-known word is used\nto designate something other than its usual designation (see below\n \u00a78.2).\n The best established words, the kuria, make their subject\nclear, but do not excite the audience\u2019s curiosity, whereas all\nother types of words are not established, and hence have the sort of\nattraction that alien or foreign things used to have. Since remote\nthings are admirable (thaumaston) and the admirable is\npleasant, Aristotle says, one should make the speech admirable and\npleasant by the use of such unfamiliar words. However one has to be\ncareful not to use inappropriately dignified or poetic words in prose\nspeech. Thus the virtue of style is accomplished by the selection and\nbalanced use of these various types of words: Fundamental for prose\nspeech is the use of usual and therefore clear words. In order to make\nthe speech pleasant and dignified and in order to avoid banality the\norator must make moderate use of non-familiar elements. Metaphor plays\nan important role for prose style, since metaphors contribute, as\nAristotle says, clarity as well as the unfamiliar, surprising effect\nthat avoids banality and tediousness.\n",
