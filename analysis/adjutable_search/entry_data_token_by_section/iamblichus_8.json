Before Iamblichus, noeron\u2014not a very\ncommon word before the second century A.D.\u2014was used to refer to\nany thinking entity, and Porphyry employs it mostly in association\nwith the soul. From Iamblichus onwards, it becomes a technical term\nwhich exclusively designates the order of gods located right below the\nIntelligible, and endowed with demiurgic functions. The word is found\nwith such a meaning in fourth-century authors in the tradition of\nIamblichus, such as the emperor Julian and Salustius.\n\nThe idea of distinguishing \u201cseen\u201d and \u201cseeing\u201d\nprinciples (objects and subjects of intellectual knowledge) dates back\nto the early interpretation of Plato\u2019s Timaeus ((39E),\nwhere the Demiurge appears to behold a Model located outside himself\nin order to gather from it all the data necessary for the creation of\nthe Cosmos: Middle Platonists thus used to distinguish between the\nDemiurge, Ideas, and Matter. As opposed to, e.g., Longinus (see\nSyrianus, In Metaphysica, 105.25\u201328), Plotinus had\ndecisively argued that intelligibles are actually not to be found\noutside the Intellect. Iamblichus instead falls back on more\ntraditional positions and expressly subordinates the Demiurge to the\nIntelligible Model. As, on the other hand, Iamblichus follows\nPlotinus\u2019 steps in developing a doctrine of the One, this\nresults in the Demiurge now being assigned a secondary rank, as he is\nsurpassed by a plethora of other deities, including the Intelligible\nModel (In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr. 42\u201346]). He is but the\nthird member of the \u201cpaternal\u201d triad, itself part of a\nlarger \u201cintellective\u201d Hebdomad (Proclus, In\nTimaeum I, 308.17\u2013309.13: compare this triad to Fr. 4\n[D-1973] In Philebum = Damascius, In Philebum \u00a7\n105). From this point onwards, until the closing of the Neoplatonic\nschools, identifying the Demiurge with the First Principle is out of\nthe question.\n\nOn the other hand, Iamblichus fully embraces Plotinus\u2019 idea that\nintelligibles are endowed with life, power, activity etc. and\ntherefore multiplicity (at least implicitly). This allows him to\nsuperpose the divine names found in theology (Orpheus, the Chaldeans,\nand the dialogues of Plato dealing with the intelligible) upon a\nconceptual armature: for instance, the Platonic Demiurge is to be\nidentified with the Zeus of Hellenic tradition. This effort reveals\nitself most conspicuously in Julian, and will find its crowning in\nProclus\u2019 Platonic Theology. As a general rule, to every\nphilosophical concept in the intelligible world there corresponds some\ndivine level or entity: the idea of such a correspondence and its\napplication to the sequence of predicates present in the hypotheses of\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides is generally assigned to\nProclus\u2019 master Syrianus, but several hints suggest that it was\nactually introduced by Iamblichus. One explicit instance of such a\nterm-to-term correspondence is the localization of the genera of Being\nwithin the intellective order rather than the intelligible one,\nbecause of the former\u2019s higher degree of multiplicity (Proclus,\nPlatonic Theology I, 52.2\u201313). This important doctrine\nimplies that the Demiurgic intellect is now conceived as some kind of\n\u201ccontainer\u201d of all intelligible ideas, with the\nreservation that it is less unified than the Model is.\n",
