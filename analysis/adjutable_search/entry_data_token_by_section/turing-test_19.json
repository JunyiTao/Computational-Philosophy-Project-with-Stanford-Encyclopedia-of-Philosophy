    "main_text": "Assessment of the Current Standing of The Turing Test || Criteria\n4.3 Criteria\n\nIn his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein famously\nwrites: \u201cAn \u2018inner process\u2019 stands in need of\noutward criteria\u201d (580). Exactly what Wittgenstein meant by this\nremark is unclear, but one way in which it might be interpreted is as\nfollows: in order to be justified in ascribing a \u201cmental\nstate\u201d to some entity, there must be some true claims about the\nobservable behavior of that entity that, (perhaps) together with other\ntrue claims about that entity (not themselves couched in\n\u201cmentalistic\u201d vocabulary), entail that the entity has the\nmental state in question. If no true claims about the observable\nbehavior of the entity can play any role in the justification of the\nascription of the mental state in question to the entity, then there\nare no grounds for attributing that kind of mental state to the\nentity.\n\nThe claim that, in order to be justified in ascribing a mental state\nto an entity, there must be some true claims about the observable\nbehavior of that entity that alone\u2014i.e. without the addition of\nany other true claims about that entity\u2014entail that the entity\nhas the mental state in question, is a piece of philosophical\nbehaviorism. It may be\u2014for all that we are able to\nargue\u2014that Wittgenstein was a philosophical behaviorist; it may\nbe\u2014for all that we are able to argue\u2014that Turing was one,\ntoo. However, if we go by the letter of the account given in the\nprevious paragraph, then all that need follow from the claim that the\nTuring Test is criterial for the ascription of intelligence (thought,\nmind) is that, when other true claims (not themselves couched in terms\nof mentalistic vocabulary) are conjoined with the claim that an entity\nhas passed the Turing Test, it then follows that the entity in\nquestion has intelligence (thought, mind).\n\n(Note that the parenthetical qualification that the additional true\nclaims not be couched in terms of mentalistic vocabulary is only one\nway in which one might try to avoid the threat of trivialization. The\ndifficulty is that the addition of the true claim that an entity has a\nmind will always produce a set of claims that entails that that entity\nhas a mind, no matter what other claims belong to the set!)\n\nTo see how the claim that the Turing Test is merely criterial for the\nascription of intelligence differs from the logical behaviorist claim\nthat the Turing Test provides logically sufficient conditions for the\nascription of intelligence, it suffices to consider the question of\nwhether it is nomically possible for there to be a\n\u201chand simulation\u201d of a Turing Test program. Many people\nhave supposed that there is good reason to deny that Blockhead is a\nnomic (or physical) possibility. For example, in The Physics of\nImmortality, Frank Tipler provides the following argument in\ndefence of the claim that it is physically impossible to \u201chand\nsimulate\u201d a Turing-Test-passing program:\n\nIf my earlier estimate that the human brain can code as much as\n1015 bits is correct, then since an average book codes\nabout 106 bits \u2026 it would require more than 100\nmillion books to code the human brain. It would take at least thirty\nfive-story main university libraries to hold this many books. We know\nfrom experience that we can access any memory in our brain in about\n100 seconds, so a hand simulation of a Turing Test-passing program\nwould require a human being to be able to take off the shelf, glance\nthrough, and return to the shelf all of these 100 million books in 100\nseconds. If each book weighs about a pound (0.5 kilograms), and on the\naverage the book moves one yard (one meter) in the process of taking\nit off the shelf and returning it, then in 100 seconds the energy\nconsumed in just moving the books is 3 x 1019 joules; the\nrate of energy consumption is 3 x 1011 megawatts. Since a\nhuman uses energy at a normal rate of 100 watts, the power required is\nthe bodily power of 3 x 1015 human beings, about a million\ntimes the current population of the entire earth. A typical large\nnuclear power plant has a power output of 1,000 megawatts, so a hand\nsimulation of the human program requires a power output equal to that\nof 300 million large nuclear power plants. As I said, a man can no\nmore hand-simulate a Turing Test-passing program than he can jump to\nthe Moon. In fact, it is far more difficult. (40)\n\n\nWhile there might be ways in which the details of Tipler\u2019s\nargument could be improved, the general point seems clearly right: the\nkind of combinatorial explosion that is required for a look-up tree\nfor a human being is ruled out by the laws and boundary conditions\nthat govern the operations of the physical world. But, if this is\nright, then, while it may be true that Blockhead is a logical\npossibility, it follows that Blockhead is not a nomic or\nphysical possibility. And then it seems natural to hold that\nThe Turing Test does indeed provide nomically sufficient\nconditions for the attribution of intelligence: given everything else\nthat we already know\u2014or, at any rate, take ourselves to\nknow\u2014about the universe in which we live, we would be fully\njustified in concluding that anything that succeeds in passing The\nTuring Test is, indeed, intelligent (possessed of a mind, and so\nforth).\n\nThere are ways in which the argument in the previous paragraph might\nbe resisted. At the very least, it is worth noting that there is a\nserious gap in the argument that we have just rehearsed. Even if we\ncan rule out \u201chand simulation\u201d of intelligence, it does\nnot follow that we have ruled out all other kinds of mere simulation\nof intelligence. Perhaps\u2014for all that has been argued so\nfar\u2014there are nomically possible ways of producing mere\nsimulations of intelligence. But, if that\u2019s right, then passing\nThe Turing Test need not be so much as criterial for the possession of\nintelligence: it need not be that given everything else that we\nalready know\u2014or, at any rate, take ourselves to know\u2014about\nthe universe in which we live, we would be fully justified in\nconcluding that anything that succeeds in passing The Turing Test is,\nindeed, intelligent (possessed of a mind, and so forth).\n\n(McDermott (2014) calculates that a look-up table for a participant\nwho makes 50 conversational exchanges would have about\n1022278 nodes. It is tempting to take this calculation to\nestablish that it is neither nomically nor physically possible for\nthere to be a \u201chand simulation\u201d of a Turing Test program,\non the grounds that the required number of nodes could not be fitted\ninto a space much much larger than the entire observable\nuniverse.)\n",
