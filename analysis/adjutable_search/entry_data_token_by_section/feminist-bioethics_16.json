These examples are more complex than they\nappear. There is compelling evidence that gender stereotyping\ncontributes to women being disproportionately diagnosed with mental\ndisorders such as depression, but it is also true that the oppression\nexperienced by women (and other marginalized groups) can in fact\ngenerate higher levels of mental distress (Stoppard 2000; Bluhm 2011;\nNicki 2016; Shaw & Proctor 2005; Ussher 2018; McDonald 2018). The\noperations of epistemic and institutional power help to explain how\nsexist bias can lead to women\u2019s accounts of their experience,\nincluding mental states, being either dismissed as trivial or\npathologized as symptoms of mental illness (see Martin 2001; Hansen et\nal. 2011; also Harbin 2022). The impact of such epistemic injustice on\nwomen in mental health and psychiatric contexts can be severe (e.g.,\nBueter 2019; Crichton et al. 2017), in the extreme leading to\ninvoluntary psychiatric treatment (Tseris et al. 2022).\n",
