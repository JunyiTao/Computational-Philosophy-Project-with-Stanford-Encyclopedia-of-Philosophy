    "main_text": "\n\nA group right is a right held by a group as a group rather than by its\nmembers severally. The \u201cgroup\u201d in \u201cgroup\nright\u201d describes the nature of the right-holder; it does not\ndescribe the mere fact that the right is confined to the members of a\ngroup rather than possessed by all members of a society or by humanity\nat large. Much of the controversy that surrounds group rights focuses\non whether groups can hold rights and, if they can, on the conditions\na group must satisfy if it is to be a right-holder. Some proponents of\ngroup rights conceive right-holding groups as moral entities in their\nown right, so that the group has a being and status analogous to those\nof an individual person. Others give groups no such independent\nstanding, but conceive group rights as rights shared in and held\njointly by the group\u2019s members. Some opponents of group rights\nchallenge the very proposition that groups can bear rights. Others do\nnot, but worry about the threats that group rights might pose for\nindividuals and their rights. They are met by counter-claims that\nindividual and group rights, suitably formulated, can be complementary\nrather than conflicting and that some group rights might also be human\nrights.\n",
