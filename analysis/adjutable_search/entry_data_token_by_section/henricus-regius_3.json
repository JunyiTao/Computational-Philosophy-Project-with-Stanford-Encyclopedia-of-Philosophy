Theory of Human Nature\n\n\nRegius acknowledged objections, as early as 1641, to scholastic\ndescriptions of human nature, according to which the human mind or\nsoul was the substantial form of the body that was capable, after\ndeath, of existing on its own. As indicated above, he accepted\nDescartes\u2019 general objections to the intelligibility and explanatory\nusefulness of substantial forms. It was unclear to him, therefore, how\nsuch forms could be used to describe or explain human nature. His\nreservations about substantial forms were articulated in the draft\ncopy of Fundamenta physices, which he had sent to Descartes prior\nto publication. The latter\u2019s objections caused Regius to delete three\nof the more controversial claims about God and the soul from the\npublished text. However, they re-appeared in the Corollaries of Regius\n1647b, and in the second edition of the text, Philosophia\nnaturalis (1654).\n\n\nDescartes had defined material substance in terms of its principal\nattribute, extension. Regius endorsed that position when he rejected\nany distinction between a corporeal substance and its extension.\n\n\nThere is no need to imagine that there is a substance in a body in\nwhich extension exists, and that it is something which in its nature\nor in reality is distinct from extension, because realities should not\nbe multiplied without necessity. Extension does not need such a\nsubject, as something that is distinct from itself; but it is\ncapable of existing on its own. (Regius 1646, 2; the phrase in italics\nwas added in Regius 1654, 3.)\n\n\nOne would expect the same logic to apply to thinking, as an attribute\nthat does not require a distinct substance. Nonetheless, Regius initially\nstopped short of saying that. While accepting that divine revelation\nteaches that the mind is a substance, he emphasized that it is\norganically united with the body. \u201cThe human mind, although it\nis a substance that is really distinct from the body, is however\norganic as long as it exists in the body\u201d (1646, 246). The mind\nwas also described as being \u201cunited most closely with the body\nin one substance\u201d (Regius 1646, 248).\n\n\nHowever, once he had been rebuked publicly by Descartes, Regius was\nfree to express himself more explicitly. In the Corollaries (Regius\n1647b), he wrote:\n\n\nAs far as the nature of things is concerned, it seems possible for the\nsoul to be either a substance or a mode of a physical substance.  Or,\nif we follow some other philosophers [i.e., Descartes] who stipulate\nthat extension and thought are attributes which are present in certain\nsubstances as their subjects, then since these attributes are not\nopposites but are just different from each other, there is nothing to\nprevent the mind from being an attribute of some kind which applies to\nthe same subject as extension, even though neither attribute is\nincluded in the concept of the other (thesis 2).\n\n\nThis is further developed in Regius 1654, in which he argues that the\nconcepts of extension and thinking are not incompatible and,\n\u201caccordingly, they [the attributes] may both be present in the\nsame simple subject\u201d (337). This anticipates the question (and\nthe implied answer) that was discussed by Locke, in the Essay\nIV, iii, 6, whether God may have superadded thought to a material\nsubstance. In the version proposed by Regius, there are no reasons why\nit would be impossible for a material entity to have the property of\nthinking because, although thinking and extension have nothing in\ncommon, they are not incompatible.\n\nRegius also included in the Corollaries two other theses that\nwere critical of Descartes and had been omitted from\nthe Fundamenta Physices: in thesis 3, he claimed that \u2018those\nwho assert that we conceive of the human mind clearly and distinctly\nas necessarily and really distinct from the body are mistaken\u2019, and in\nthesis 13 that \u2018all common notions that are engraved in the mind\nderive their origin from the observation of things or from\ntradition\u2019. Regius also claimed that these conclusions from experience\nand reason, within the scope of natural philosophy, were consistent\nwith thesis 4, that divine revelation provides indubitable evidence\nfor belief that the human mind is a distinct substance.\n\n\nThese early statements in thesis form of criticisms of Descartes were\nsubsequently expanded in Regius 1654. Many of Descartes\u2019\ncontemporaries had understood him as arguing that there must be a real\ndistinction between mind and body because it is possible to doubt\nhaving a body although it is impossible to doubt having a mind. Regius\naddressed this argument explicitly:\n\n\nThe fact that we can doubt the body but cannot possibly doubt the mind\ndoes not prevent the mind from being a mode of the body. That merely\nproves that, while we are doubting the body, we cannot say with\ncertainty that the mind is its mode. In the mean time, since the body\nabout which we doubt may nevertheless subsist and since there is no\nreason why it may not be modified by the mind\u2014which is evident\nfrom what has been said earlier\u2014this is enough to show that the\nmind of which we are certain may be a mode of that doubtful body.\n(1654, 338)\n\n\nGiven Regius\u2019 disagreement with Descartes about the concept of a human\nmind, and his rejection of innate ideas, it was not surprising that he\nalso rejected the ontological argument for God\u2019s existence that\nDescartes had proposed in the Fifth Meditation (AT VII, 65). The Dutch\nphilosopher accepted that the \u201cactual and necessary existence of\nGod is comprehended in the idea or concept of God.\u201d He argued,\nhowever, that it does not follow from that concept that God exists\nactually and necessarily. \u201cIt merely follows that, if he existed\nanywhere, he would exist necessarily rather than contingently or that,\nin that case, he would not be capable of not existing\u201d (Regius\n1654, 357).\n\n\nOne could interpret the gradual dissociation between Regius and\nDescartes, and the rejection by the former of the latter\u2019s\nmetaphysics, as an endorsement by Regius of one dominant feature of\nthe Cartesian enterprise, namely, the new natural philosophy that was\ninaugurated in Le Monde. Regius had followed the logic of\nDescartes\u2019 natural philosophy by denying any explanatory value in the\nhypothesis of souls in animals. \u201cSince indeed the actions of\nbeasts \u2026 can be explained simply by the disposition of their\nspirits and other bodily parts, and since entities should not be\nmultiplied without necessity, we have no reason to attribute any\nintellect to beasts\u201d (Regius 1646, 241\u201342). He might have\nfollowed the same logic in the case of human intelligence, had he not\nbeen restrained by his understanding of the teaching of Scripture, and\nhis apparent acceptance on biblical grounds that the human mind is an\nimmaterial substance. Rather than endorse Cartesian metaphysics, as\nfound in the Meditations, which seemed to return its author\nto the scholastic philosophy that he explicitly rejected, Regius\nstruggled with the competing demands of Scripture and the logic of\nCartesian natural philosophy. The challenge of this conjunction is\nevident in Regius\u2019 repeated attempts to describe the unity of mind and\nbody \u2018in a single substance\u2019 (1646, 248) while maintaining\nthat the mind is \u201csomething that is really distinct from the\nbody and is separable from it in reality\u201d (1646, 246). This\nepistemic dualism, to the effect that we acquire some beliefs from\nnatural knowledge and others from Scripture, has been understood, by\nsome readers, as intellectually dishonest and as a typical libertine\ncamouflage for cryptic materialism (Hallyn, 2005). But, as Bos (2013)\nshows, Regius may have accepted the limits of human knowledge, based\non reason and experience, and also adopted a commonplace understanding\nof the certainty of Scripture. By doing so, he became a reluctant\ndualist without endorsing Cartesian metaphysics.\n",
