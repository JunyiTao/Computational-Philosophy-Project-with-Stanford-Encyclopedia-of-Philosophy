    "main_text": "Legal Rights as Reasons || Legal Rights as Preemptory Reasons\n8.1 Legal Rights as Preemptory Reasons\n\nRights are preemptory. A preemptory reason to \u03c6 is reason to block\nconsidering or acting on certain other reasons pertaining as to\nwhether or not to \u03c6 (Hart 1982: 86, 253\u2013254). Rights,\ntherefore, enjoy a measure of qualitative precedence over certain\nother reasons, which is why rights are reasons that, in a sense,\n\u201cpunch\u201d above their normative weight (see, e.g., Nozick\n1974: 171\u2013173). That is, when in conflict with other even\nweightier reasons, rights can still prevail\u2014not by\nquantitatively outweighing those competing reasons but by\nqualitatively preempting them. Indeed, it is not uncommon that an\ninfringement of a legal right is impermissible even if in furtherance\nof the overall good or utility (Dworkin 1977: 190\u2013192; Lyons\n1982: 113\u2013118). \n\nTrying to capture the preemptory quality of rights, Dworkin borrows a\nmetaphor from the game of bridge (and other card games), referring to\nrights as \u201ctrumps\u201d (Dworkin 1984: 153\u2013167). In\nbridge, a card that is a member of the \u201ctrump suit\u201d\ndefeats cards not in the suit, regardless of the cards\u2019\nnumerical values. Similarly, rights override conflicting reasons as a\nmatter of category, regardless of the relative normative weight or\nstrength of those other reasons. \n\nAnother prism for capturing the preemptory quality of rights are\n\u201cexclusionary reasons\u201d (Raz 1975 [1999: 35\u201348]. An\nexclusionary reason counts in favor of refraining from acting on\nanother reason. Viewed in these terms, the preemptory nature of rights\nis explained not in terms of the weight or force of rights, but in\nterms of rights\u2019 exclusionary nature (Kamm 2002: 488). Under\nthis view, a right to \u03c6 is not only reason to \u03c6 but also\nreason to exclude and not to act on or rule based on at least certain\nreasons not to \u03c6\u2014even if the relative weight of those\nconflicting reasons is greater than that of the reasons counting in\nfavor of \u03c6-ing. \n",
