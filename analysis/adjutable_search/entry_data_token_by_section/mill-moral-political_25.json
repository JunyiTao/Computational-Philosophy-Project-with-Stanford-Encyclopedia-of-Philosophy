Though Mill is an\nadvocate of limited government in ways that one might expect given his\ndefense of basic liberties in On Liberty, he is no\nlibertarian. He emphatically rejects the idea that legitimate\ngovernment is limited to the functions of affording protection against\nforce and fraud (PPE V.i.2). Instead, he thinks that there\nare a variety of ways in which government can and should intervene in\nthe lives of citizens\u2014sometimes as coercer and other times as\nenabler or facilitator\u2014in order to promote the common good.\nMill\u2019s claims about happiness imply that the good of each\nconsists in the exercise of her higher capacities. This requires an\nactive life in which one\u2019s activities are regulated by\none\u2019s deliberations and choices. As we have seen in Mill\u2019s\ncritical discussions of paternalism, this places limits on how others\ncan promote one\u2019s own good. I can\u2019t promote your good,\nunderstood in this way, in ways that bypass your agency anymore than I\ncan win a race for you. But just as I can do things to help you win\nthe race yourself (training with you, sharing nutritional tips, and\nhelping you plan strategy), so too I can do things that help you lead\nan autonomous life. I can provide various sorts of necessary\nconditions for your leading such a life. If an individual\u2019s good\nconsists in this sort of self-realization, then a government\nwhich aims at the common good should concern itself in significant\npart with the fair provision of opportunities for\nwelfare.\n\nEarly in The Subjection of Women Mill contrasts systems of\nhereditary caste, such as feudalism and social systems based on\nslavery, with the distinctively modern and progressive commitment to\nequal opportunity for welfare.\n\n\nFor, what is the peculiar character of the modern world\u2014the\ndifference which chiefly distinguishes modern institutions, modern\nsocial ideas, modern life itself, from those of times long past? It is\nthat human beings are no longer born into their place in life, and\nchained down by an inexorable bond to the place they are born to, but\nare free to employ their faculties, and such favorable chances as\noffer, to achieve the lot which may appear to them most desirable.\n(SW 272\u201373)\n\n\nAs with basic liberties, opportunities for welfare have value, not in\nthemselves, but as necessary conditions for the sort of\nself-realization to which Mill assigns pre-eminent intrinsic value.\nBut they are no less important for that reason. Indeed, many of the\nfunctions of government that he recognizes can be traced to providing\nconditions and opportunities for self-realization.\n\nThough Mill generally opposes paternalism, censorship, offense\nregulation, and moralism, he does recognize various functions that\ngovernment should perform in pursuing the common good. In part because\nthe opportunities for each depend in part upon the position and\nresources of others, Mill thinks that provision of fair equality of\nopportunity constrains permissible socio-economic inequalities\n(PPE II.ii.1).\n\n\nA just and wise legislation would abstain from holding out motives for\ndissipating rather than saving the earnings of honest exertion. Its\nimpartiality between competitors would consist in endeavoring that\nthey should all start fair \u2026. Many, indeed, fail with greater\nefforts than those with which others succeed, not from difference of\nmerits, but difference of opportunities; but if all were done which it\nwould be in the power of a good government to do, by instruction and\nby legislation, to diminish this inequality of opportunities, the\ndifferences of fortune arising from people\u2019s own earnings could\nnot justly give umbrage. (PPE V.ii.3)\n\n\nAs Mill makes clear in this passage, his concern is not with\ninequality as such. Though he envisions a society in which\ninequalities are reduced and in which a decent minimum standard of\nliving is available to all (PPE IV.vi.2), he does defend the\nprofits of capitalists as a just recompense for their savings, risk,\nand economic supervision (PPE II.xv.1; \u201cChapters on\nSocialism\u201d 734\u201335). Rather, Mill\u2019s concern in this\npassage is with inequalities derived from inequality of opportunity\nand those inequalities that perpetuate inequality of opportunity. To\nachieve equality of opportunity, Mill endorses various redistributive\ntax measures (also see Berger 1984: 159\u201386). He defends a flat\ntax rate on earned income above a threshold necessary to secure a\ndecent minimum standard of living, leaving earned income below this\nthreshold untaxed (PPE II.i.3, II.xii.2, II.xii.3,\nV.ii.1\u20133, V.iii.3\u20135). In addition, he endorses the use of\nhigher tax rates on unearned income and on inheritance (PPE\nII.ii.1, II.ii.3\u20134, II.xii.3, V.ii.3, V.ii.5, V.vi.2, V.ix.1).\nSuch taxes limit intergenerational inequalities that would otherwise\nconstrain equality of opportunity.\n\nWithin this framework established for equal opportunity, Mill defends\nadditional governmental functions designed to promote the common good.\nA prime condition of normative competence is a decent education, and\nMill thinks that it is one of the central roles of the state to\nrequire and, if necessary, provide a quality education (OL V\n12\u201313; PPE V.xi.8). Mill thinks that the state can and\nshould require parents to provide schooling for their children,\nensuring that this kind of education is available to all, regardless\nof financial circumstances, by subsidizing the costs of education for\nthe poor so that it is available free or at a nominal cost.\n\nWe have also seen that Mill thinks that charity breeds dependence,\nrather than autonomy. This is one reason that he defends the adoption\nof Poor Laws that provide, among other things, work for the\nable-bodied indigent (PPE II.xii.2). Mill also thinks that\ngovernment should step in where market forces are unlikely to provide\nwhat people need or want (PPE V.xi.8). In this way, he thinks\nthat it is an important function for the state, whether central or\nlocal, to create and maintain various aspects of community\ninfrastructure, including such things as a common defense, roads,\nsanitation, police, and correctional facilities (PPE V.vii.1;\nCRG 541). He also thinks regulation of working conditions\n(hours, wages, and benefits) is permissible, because the provision of\nimproved working conditions typically has the structure of a public or\ncollective good for workers, each of whom stands to gain a competitive\nadvantage by conceding a little more to capital than his peers\n(PPE V.xi.12). If left unregulated, each has incentive to\nconcede more to capital than his rivals, with the result that all\nworkers are made worse-off. State intervention and regulation, Mill\nthinks, is the best solution to this collective action problem. He\nalso thinks that there are other goods for which market provision will\nlead to underproduction, presumably because of positive externalities,\nwhich is why he thinks that the state should subsidize scientific\nresearch and the arts (PPE V.xi.15).\n\nMill\u2019s liberalism is committed to democratic political\ninstitutions in which the franchise is widespread, private property\nrights, market economies, equal social and economic opportunity, and a\nvariety of personal and civic liberties. To appreciate the\nsignificance of his brand of liberalism, it is helpful to focus on the\nsubstance of his conception of liberal essentials\u2014the package of\nindividual liberties and state responsibilities that he\nendorses\u2014and the way he justifies his conception of liberal\nessentials. Millian liberalism is not laissez-faire liberalism, and it\njustifies liberal essentials as a way of promoting the common good.\nThe distinctiveness of this brand of liberalism is perhaps best seen\nin contrast with two other conceptions of liberalism\u2014a more\nlibertarian conception of liberal essentials and their justification\nthat dominated the British Liberal Party at mid-century and the sort\nof contemporary political liberalism that justifies liberal essentials\nas required if the state is to be neutral among rival conceptions of\nthe good life that its citizens might hold.\n\nA good part of the agenda of the Liberal Party during much of the\nnineteenth century consisted in reforms that sought to undo\nlimitations that the state placed on the liberties and opportunities\nof citizens, especially when these forms of state intervention tended\nto reinforce class privileges. This political culture was exemplified\nin the repeal of the Corn Laws, opposition to religious persecution,\nand several electoral reforms. But in the later part of the nineteenth\ncentury there emerged a new view about the role of such reforms within\nthe Liberal agenda. Earlier Liberals, such as Herbert Spencer, thought\nthat reform should be limited to the removal of state interference\nwith individual liberty. By contrast, the New Liberals thought that\nthese reforms that extended economic, social, and political liberties\nhad to be supplemented by social and economic reforms in areas of\nlabor, education, and health designed to redress the effects of\ninequality. These new reforms gave the state positive, and not just\nnegative, responsibilities that sometimes required interference with\nindividual liberties. Because Mill thinks that the state has an\nimportant role to play in securing equal opportunity, ensuring a good\neducation that will nurture normative competence, and redressing\nvarious market failures and providing various public goods, it makes\nsense to view Mill as laying much of the intellectual groundwork for\nthe New Liberalism\u2014both in its conception of liberal essentials\nand in its conception of the proper justification of liberal\nessentials by appeal to a broadly consequentialist interest in\npromoting self-realization.\n\nMill\u2019s perfectionist justification of liberal essentials also\nprovides a contrast with an influential strand in recent\nAnglo-American philosophical defenses of liberalism that insist on\nneutrality among rival conceptions of the good life (see\nTurner 2017). According to many contemporary liberals, neutrality\nabout the good is a constitutive commitment of liberalism, and liberal\nneutrality places limits on the justification of state action. Liberal\ngovernments, on this view, can and must enforce individual rights and\nany further demands of social justice, including those necessary to\nmaintain peace and order. But they are not to undertake any action as\na way of promoting a particular conception of the good life or a\ncomprehensive philosophical doctrine. On matters of the good, a\nliberal state must be strictly neutral. It can promote the good of its\ncitizenry only in ways that are consistent with every reasonable\nconception of the good (see Rawls 1993 and Kymlicka 1989).\n\nBy contrast, Mill is a perfectionist liberal who eschews neutrality\nabout the good. According to Millian perfectionism, the good life is\nnot defined in sectarian terms as consisting in a particular set of\nactivities. Rather, the good life is understood in terms of the\nexercise of capacities for practical deliberation that can be realized\nin diverse, though limited, ways. Basic liberties are important\nbecause they are necessary conditions for this sort of reflective\nself-direction and self-realization. On this version of liberalism,\nthe state recognizes various civil liberties and resists regular\npaternalism and moralism, not because it won\u2019t take a stand on\nquestions of the good, but precisely because it recognizes autonomy\nand self-determination as higher-order goods.\n",
