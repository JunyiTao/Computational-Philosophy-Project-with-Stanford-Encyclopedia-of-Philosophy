    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nSusman was born on October 14, 1872, in Hamburg, Germany to a\nwell-situated, Jewish, middle-class family. In 1882, the family moved\nto Zurich, Switzerland, where Susman attended primary school and the\ngymnasium. While her father was supportive of her as a poet, arranging\nfor a private publication of a volume of her poetry on the occasion of\nher twentieth birthday, he staunchly opposed her wish to study. In\n1894, after his death, the family returned to Germany to settle in\nHanover. In order to allow Susman to study, her older sister Paula\nassumed sole responsibility for the care of their ailing mother. After\nstudying painting in D\u00fcsseldorf and Paris, Susman began to study\nphilosophy in Munich with Theodor Lipps. She subsequently moved to\nBerlin, where she studied with Georg Simmel, becoming a regular\nparticipant in his after-hours private discussion group. In 1906,\nSusman married a fellow painter, Eduard von Bendemann. Though\ninitially willing to comply with his parents\u2019 request that, as a\ncondition of their marriage, she convert to Christianity, Susman\ndecided the day before her baptism that it was impossible for her to\nabandon Judaism. Her parents-in-law accepted her decision. The same\nyear, Georg Simmel published his book Religion as part of\nMartin Buber\u2019s series Society: Series in\nSocial-Psychological Studies, dedicating it to Susman and Gertrud\nKantorowicz.\n\nFrom 1907 to 1932, she was a regular contributor to the\nFrankfurter Zeitung. During this time, she reviewed new\npublications in literature and philosophy, often with a particular\nfocus on the German-Jewish experience. From 1912 to 1915, she lived\nwith her family in R\u00fcschlikon, near Zurich. The family returned\nto Germany in 1915, first living in Frankfurt and then, beginning in\n1919, living on a farm close to the Swiss border in S\u00e4ckingen on\nthe Rhine. Although inspired by the vision of Gustav Landauer and the\nlife reform movement to move to the countryside to get away from the\npostwar chaos in Frankfurt, the long hours of work on the farm left\nSusman only with the nights for reading (Susman 1964: 96).\n\nSusman\u2019s review of Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s Star of\nRedemption (1921) in Der Jude, Weimar Germany\u2019s\npremier Jewish literary journal, which was published by Buber from\n1916\u20131928, was one of the earliest critical recognitions of the\nsignificance of Rosenzweig\u2019s philosophically critical turn, or\nwhat he called \u201cnew thinking\u201d. Rosenzweig credited Susman\nwith having understood his work like nobody else. In a letter to her,\nresponding to her review, he wrote:\n\n\nThe following will confirm how profoundly you understood the book: the\nline that you chose as motto for your essay I wrote back in November\n18 in completely clear awareness that it is the core and central\nproposition of the whole [book]. (collected in Rosenzweig 1979: volume\n2.1, 752)\n\n\nFrom 1926 to 1935, Susman published her most important essays in the\nbi-monthly journal Der Morgen, which, from 1925\u20131938,\nwas the leading intellectual forum of German Jewry. With the German\nphilosopher Arnold Metzger, Susman read, in 1927, another seminal book\nthat had just left the press and that in her view would compare\nunfavorably to Rosenzweig\u2019s: Heidegger\u2019s Being and\nTime (1927).\n\nIn 1928, the von Bendemanns divorced and Susman moved to Frankfurt\nwhere she stayed until 1933. On New Year\u2019s Eve of 1933, she\nfound herself the only passenger on the night train from Amsterdam to\nZurich; she arrived in Zurich on the morning of the new year and\nremained there until the end of her life, in 1966. In her\nautobiography, she called this chapter of her life \u201cemigration\nhome\u201d. Her last publication in Germany included an essay (1935a)\nexamining Adalbert Stifter\u2019s subliminal antisemitism in his\nnovella Abdias (1842). The essay also appeared as a postface\nto the novella published in the Schocken small book series dedicated\nto Jewish cultural resistance in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. The other\nessay with which she ended a decade of contributing to Der\nMorgen, \u201cOn the Intellectual Contribution of Jews in the\nGerman Region\u201d (\u201cVom geistigen Anteil der Juden im\ndeutschen Raum\u201d, 1935b), was a brief survey of signature\ncontributions to German culture and philosophy from Moses Mendelssohn\nto Franz Kafka. The essay concluded with the suggestion that Jewish\nlife might well have ended in Germany and would perhaps resume one day\nin another corner of the world.\n\nFor Susman, the return to Zurich was more than a homecoming to the\ncity of the formative years of her late childhood and adolescence; it\nwas a return to a place that was becoming a temporary safe haven for\nEurope\u2019s refuges, especially its German speaking emigrant\nintelligentsia. Here, Susman found a new intellectual home in the\nreligious socialist circle of Leonhard Ragaz. Her work appeared in his\njournal Neue Wege from 1935\u20131965. In Zurich, Susman\nalso became the center of a circle of young German and Swiss Jewish\nintellectuals, acting as a mentor to and source of intellectual and\nemotional support for many of its participants, notably the\nphilosophers Michael Landmann, Hermann Levin Goldschmidt, and Jacob\nTaubes.\n\nIn 1946, she published The Book of Job and the Destiny of the\nJewish People. The book was among the first attempts to wrestle\nwith the predicament of how to continue life after Auschwitz. Susman\nreturns to the figure of Job, servant of God, as the paradigmatic\nfigure to reimagine Jewish life after the Shoah. While this book dealt\nwith the challenge to making sense of the Jewish experience,\nInterpretation of a Great Love: Goethe and Charlotte von\nStein (Deutung einer grossen Liebe: Goethe und Charlotte\nStein, 1951) scrutinized the remains of the German state of mind\nby revisiting the twists and turns of the legendary yet conflicted\nlove of Germany\u2019s famed cultural icon, Goethe. Examining the\nprofound but painful and ultimately doomed love affair of the most\nrevered German thinker and artist, Susman shed light on the darker\nsides of the deep-running issues haunting German affective life.\n\nDeutung biblischer Gestalten (Interpretation of Biblical\nFigures, hereafter DBG), which featured essays from the 1930s and\n1940s, came in 1955. Susman, who had gone blind in her final years,\ndictated her last publication, her autobiography Ich habe viele\nLeben gelebt: Erinnerungen (I Have Lived Many Lives:\nMemoirs), published in 1964.\n",
