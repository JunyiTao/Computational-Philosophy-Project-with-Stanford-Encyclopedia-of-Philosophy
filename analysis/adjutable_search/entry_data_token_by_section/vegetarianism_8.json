Extending Moral Vegetarian Arguments: Animal Products and Plants\n\nMoral veganism accepts moral vegetarianism and adds to it that\nconsuming animal products is wrong. Mere moral vegetarians deny this\nand add to moral vegetarianism that it is permissible to consume\nanimal products. An additional issue that divides some moral vegans\nand moral vegetarians is whether animal product production is\nwrong. This raises a general question: If it is wrong to produce meat\non the grounds adduced in\n \u00a72,\n what other foods are wrongfully produced? If it is wrong to hurt\nchickens for meat, isn\u2019t it wrong to hurt them for eggs? If it\nis wrong to harm workers in the production of meat, isn\u2019t it\nwrong to harm workers in the production of animal products? If it is\nwrong to produce huge quantities of methane for meat, isn\u2019t it\nwrong to produce it for milk? These are challenges posed by moral\nveganism. \n\nBut various vegan diets raise moral questions. If it is wrong to hurt\nchickens for meat, is it wrong to hurt mice and moles while harvesting\ncrops? If it is wrong to harm workers in the production of meat,\nisn\u2019t it wrong to harm workers in the production of tomatoes? If\nit is wrong to use huge quantities of water for meat, isn\u2019t it\nwrong to use huge quantities of water for almonds?\n",
