    "main_text": "Controversies about Application || Discretion\n8.1 Discretion\n\nHow far should it be the mission of the Rule of Law to eliminate or\nreduce the amount of discretion in the way a society is governed? Some\njurists, like Dicey (1885) and to a lesser extent Hayek (1944) insist\nthat official discretion is inherently antithetical to the Rule of\nLaw. Others, like Davis (1969), condemn this as an extravagant\nposition, arguing that discretion is ineliminable in the modern\nadministrative state. The rule of the Rule of Law is not to eliminate\ndiscretion, but to ensure that it is properly framed and authorized,\nand that the application of rules and judicial procedures is preserved\nfor those cases where liberty and well-being are most seriously at\nstake.\n",
