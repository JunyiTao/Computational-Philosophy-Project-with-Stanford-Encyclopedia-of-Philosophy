    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object?\n3. What is an Abstract Object?\n\nAs part of his attempt to understand the nature of possible worlds,\nLewis (1986a, 81\u201386) categorizes different ways by which one can\ndraw the abstract/concrete\n distinction.[4]\n These include: the way of example (which is simply to list\nthe paradigm cases of abstract and concrete objects in the hope that\nthe sense of the distinction will somehow emerge); the way of\nconflation (i.e., identifying abstract and concrete objects with\nsome already-known distinction); the way of negation (i.e.,\nsaying what abstract objects are by saying what they are not, e.g.,\nnon-spatiotemporal, non-causal, etc.); and the\nway of abstraction (i.e., saying that abstract objects are\nconceptualized by a process of considering some known objects and\nomitting certain distinguishing features). He gives a detailed\nexamination of the different proposals that typify these ways and then\nattempts to show that none of them quite succeeds in classifying the\nparadigms in accord with prevailing usage. Given the problems he\nencountered when analyzing the various ways, Lewis became pessimistic\nabout our ability to draw the distinction cleanly.\n\nDespite Lewis\u2019s pessimism about clarifying the abstract/concrete\ndistinction, his approach for categorizing the various proposals, when\nextended, is a useful one. Indeed, in what follows, we\u2019ll see\nthat there are a number of additional ways that categorize\nattempts to characterize the abstract/concrete distinction and\ntheorize about abstract objects. Even if there is no single,\nacceptable account, these various ways of drawing the distinction and\ntheorizing about abstract objects do often cast light on the questions\nwe\u2019ve been discussing, especially when the specific proposals\nare integrated into a supplementary (meta-)ontological project. For\neach method of drawing the distinction and specific proposal adopting\nthat method acquires a certain amount of explanatory power, and this\nwill help us to compare and contrast the various ideas that are now\nfound in the literature.\n",
