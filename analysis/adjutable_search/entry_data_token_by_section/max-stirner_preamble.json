    "main_text": "\n\nMax Stirner (1806\u20131856) is the author of Der Einzige und\nsein Eigenthum (1844). This book is usually known as The Ego\nand Its Own in English, but a more literal, and informative,\ntranslation would be The Unique Individual and their\nProperty. Both the form and content of Stirner\u2019s major work\nare disconcerting. He challenges his readers\u2019 expectations about\nhow political and philosophical argument should be conducted, and\nshakes their confidence in the moral and political superiority of\ncontemporary civilisation. Stirner provides a sweeping attack on the\nmodern world as increasingly dominated by \u201creligious\u201d\nmodes of thought and oppressive social institutions, together with a\nmuch briefer sketch of a radical \u201cegoistic\u201d alternative in\nwhich individual autonomy might flourish. The historical impact of\nThe Ego and Its Own is difficult to assess, but\nStirner\u2019s work can be said: to have had an immediate and\ndestructive impact on the left-Hegelian movement; to have played an\nimportant role in the intellectual development of Karl Marx\n(1818\u20131883); and to have subsequently influenced the political\ntradition of individualist anarchism.\n",
