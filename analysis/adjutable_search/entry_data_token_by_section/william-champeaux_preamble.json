    "main_text": "\n\n\nBorn in Champeaux, William (ca. 1070-1122) taught at the cathedral\nschool of Notre Dame in Paris and the monastery of St. Victor. His\nstaunch defense of realism in logic and metaphysics earned him a\nreputation as a preeminent philosopher of the late eleventh and early\ntwelfth centuries. William was a student of Anselm of Laon, and, like\nothers from his school, he was committed to the view that articles of\nfaith are beyond the capacity of human reason to understand and human\nlanguage to explain. He was recognized in his day as one of the\ncontinent's most influential theologians. These philosophical and\ntheological commitments fueled the conflict with his most famous\nstudent, Peter Abelard, a conflict that was continued between Abelard\nand William's most famous prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Bernard of\nClairvaux.\n",
