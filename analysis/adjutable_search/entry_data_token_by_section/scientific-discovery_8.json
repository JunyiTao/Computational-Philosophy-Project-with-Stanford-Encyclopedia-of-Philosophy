Anomalies and the structure of discovery\n\nMany philosophers maintain that discovery is a legitimate topic for\nphilosophy of science while abandoning the notion that there is a\nlogic of discovery. One very influential approach is Thomas\nKuhn\u2019s analysis of the emergence of novel facts and theories\n(Kuhn 1970 [1962]: chapter 6). Kuhn identifies a general pattern of\ndiscovery as part of his account of scientific change. A discovery is\nnot a simple act, but an extended, complex process, which culminates\nin paradigm changes. Paradigms are the symbolic generalizations,\nmetaphysical commitments, values, and exemplars that are shared by a\ncommunity of scientists and that guide the research of that community.\nParadigm-based, normal science does not aim at novelty but instead at\nthe development, extension, and articulation of accepted paradigms. A\ndiscovery begins with an anomaly, that is, with the recognition that\nthe expectations induced by an established paradigm are being\nviolated. The process of discovery involves several aspects:\nobservations of an anomalous phenomenon, attempts to conceptualize it,\nand changes in the paradigm so that the anomaly can be\naccommodated.\n\nIt is the mark of success of normal science that it does not make\ntransformative discoveries, and yet such discoveries come about as a\nconsequence of normal, paradigm-guided science. The more detailed and\nthe better developed a paradigm, the more precise are its predictions.\nThe more precisely the researchers know what to expect, the better\nthey are able to recognize anomalous results and violations of\nexpectations:\n\n\nnovelty ordinarily emerges only for the man who, knowing with\nprecision what he should expect, is able to recognize that something\nhas gone wrong. Anomaly appears only against the background provided\nby the paradigm. (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 65)\n\n\nDrawing on several historical examples, Kuhn argues that it is usually\nimpossible to identify the very moment when something was discovered\nor even the individual who made the discovery. Kuhn illustrates these\npoints with the discovery of oxygen (see Kuhn 1970 [1962]:\n53\u201356). Oxygen had not been discovered before 1774 and had been\ndiscovered by 1777. Even before 1774, Lavoisier had noticed that\nsomething was wrong with phlogiston theory, but he was unable to move\nforward. Two other investigators, C. W. Scheele and Joseph Priestley,\nindependently identified a gas obtained from heating solid substances.\nBut Scheele\u2019s work remained unpublished until after 1777, and\nPriestley did not identify his substance as a new sort of gas. In\n1777, Lavoisier presented the oxygen theory of combustion, which gave\nrise to fundamental reconceptualization of chemistry. But according to\nthis theory as Lavoisier first presented it, oxygen was not a chemical\nelement. It was an atomic \u201cprinciple of acidity\u201d and\noxygen gas was a combination of that principle with caloric. According\nto Kuhn, all of these developments are part of the discovery of\noxygen, but none of them can be singled out as \u201cthe\u201d act\nof discovery.\n\nIn pre-paradigmatic periods or in times of paradigm crisis,\ntheory-induced discoveries may happen. In these periods, scientists\nspeculate and develop tentative theories, which may lead to novel\nexpectations and experiments and observations to test whether these\nexpectations can be confirmed. Even though no precise predictions can\nbe made, phenomena that are thus uncovered are often not quite what\nhad been expected. In these situations, the simultaneous exploration\nof the new phenomena and articulation of the tentative hypotheses\ntogether bring about discovery.\n\nIn cases like the discovery of oxygen, by contrast, which took place\nwhile a paradigm was already in place, the unexpected becomes apparent\nonly slowly, with difficulty, and against some resistance. Only\ngradually do the anomalies become visible as such. It takes time for\nthe investigators to recognize \u201cboth that something is and what\nit is\u201d (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 55). Eventually, a new paradigm\nbecomes established and the anomalous phenomena become the expected\nphenomena.\n\nRecent studies in cognitive neuroscience of brain activity during\nperiods of conceptual change support Kuhn\u2019s view that conceptual\nchange is hard to achieve. These studies examine the neural processes\nthat are involved in the recognition of anomalies and compare them\nwith the brain activity involved in the processing of information that\nis consistent with preferred theories. The studies suggest that the\ntwo types of data are processed differently (Dunbar et al. 2007).\n",
