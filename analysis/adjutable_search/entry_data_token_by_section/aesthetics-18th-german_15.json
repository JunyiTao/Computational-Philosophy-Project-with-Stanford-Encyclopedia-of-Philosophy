Moritz: Art as that which is Perfect in itself\n\n\nKarl Philipp Moritz (1756\u20131793) is the last of the pre-Kantian\nGerman aestheticians who will be considered here. Moritz was another\nof the many German intellectuals of the eighteenth century who rose to\nrenown from unpromising beginnings. He was the son of an army musician\nwho sought refuge from his own circumstances in Quietism, an extreme\nsect of Pietism, and inflicted its religiosity upon his son. After\nseveral years as an apprentice to a hatmaker, Moritz was able to\nattend grammar school.  He spent a few years at the\nuniversities in Erfurt and Wittenberg, interspersed with attempts to\nbecome an actor and a stay at the seminary of the Moravian Brothers,\nanother Pietist sect. At twenty-two, he became a schoolteacher in\nBerlin. In 1782 he made a trip to England and published a travelogue\nwhich won him some recognition, after which he returned to his school\nuntil 1786, when his publisher financed a trip to Italy in the hope of\ngetting another popular travelogue out of him. In Italy Moritz became\na friend of Goethe, who would write a much more famous account of his\nItalian journey, and learned enough about classical art to become\nprofessor of aesthetics at the Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1789, the\nposition he held until his death just four years later. Moritz\u2019s\npublications during his brief but intense literary career included, in\naddition to his Italian travelogue, eventually published in\n1792\u20133, the novels Anton Reiser (1786\u201390), a\nbarely fictionalized autobiography, and Andreas Hartknopf: An\nAllegory; philological works including an Essay on German\nProsody in 1786 and Lectures on Style in 1793; textbooks\non grammar and logic for children, a German Grammar for the\nLadies, English and Italian grammars for Germans, and an\neventually very successful account of Greek mythology aimed at both\nchildren and adults; a Theory of Ornament; and a journal of\n\u201cempirical psychology\u201d (erfahrende Seelenkunde)\nthat he edited for ten years. But what concern us here are the essays\nin aesthetics that Moritz published between 1785 and 1791.\n\n\nThese essays commence with the ambitiously entitled \u201cAttempt at\na Unification of all the Fine Arts and Sciences under the Concept\nof that which is complete in itself,\u201d dedicated to\nMoses Mendelssohn and published in 1785 in an issue of\nthe Berlinische Monatsschrift that also contained an article\n(on astronomy) by Kant. In these essays Moritz argues that works of\nart please us because they have an \u201cinternal\npurposiveness\u201d independent of any purpose external to them, a\nconception that might seem to anticipate Kant\u2019s own account of\nbeauty as \u201cpurposiveness without a purpose\u201d and the\nnineteenth-century conception of \u201cart for art\u2019s sake.\u201d It\nis certainly possible that Kant read Moritz\u2019s essay,\nappearing as it did alongside one of his own, but Kant\u2019s notion of\n\u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cformal\u201d purposiveness is\nmore a repudiation of Moritz\u2019s conception of \u201cinternal\npurposiveness\u201d than a successor to it. Moritz\u2019s view is\nalso distinct from later conceptions of \u201cart for art\u2019s\nsake.\u201d In fact, as the brief \u201cOutlines of a Complete\nTheory of the Fine Arts\u201d that he published in the journal of the\nAcademy of Arts in 1789 makes clear, Moritz rejected the\n\u201csubjectivist\u201d view that our pleasure in artistic or\nnatural beauty is due primarily to the way in which it freely engages\nour own mental powers on which the theory of Kant and later advocates\nof \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d is based in favor of an\n\u201cobjectivist\u201d view:\nThe genuinely beautiful is not merely in us and in\nour manner of representation, but is to be found outside us\nin the objects themselves. (\u201cGrundlinien zu einer vollst\u00e4ndigen\nTheorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste,\u201d in Werke, volume II, pp.\n591\u20132, at p. 591)\n\n\nWhat Moritz actually held is that the\n\u201cinternal purposiveness\u201d of a work of art is an\nintimation of the perfection of the world as a whole, and that we\nenjoy it precisely as such an intimation. Thus Moritz attempted to\nstem the growth of the theory of aesthetic experience as free play by\nreverting to a theory of beauty as an intimation of the true order of\nthe cosmos that has its roots in the views of Wolff and\nShaftesbury.\n\n\nBoth the essay on art as \u201cthat which is complete in\nitself\u201d and a longer pamphlet \u201cOn the formative Imitation\nof the Beautiful\u201d (\u00dcber die bildende Nachahmung des\nSch\u00f6nen) that Moritz published in 1788 start off with a contrast\nbetween the beautiful on the one side and the useful and the good on\nthe other in a way that does anticipate the opening stratagem of\nKant\u2019s \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d in his Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment in 1790. Moritz analyses the useful in\nparticular as a means to a perfection that lies outside of the useful\nobject itself, namely,\nthe convenience or comfortableness that accrues to\nmyself or another through the use of it\u2026i.e., I consider it\nmerely as a means, for which I myself, in so far as my perfection is\nthereby promoted, am the end. The merely useful object is thus in\nitself nothing whole or complete.\n\n\nThen he immediately assumes, as if this were the\nonly alternative, that\nIn the contemplation of the beautiful I roll the\nend from myself back into the object itself: I consider it, as\nsomething that is complete not in me but rather in\nitself, that thus comprises a whole in itself, and that affords\nme pleasure on its own account. (\u201c\u00dcber den Begriff\ndes in sich selbst Vollendeten,\u201d Werke, volume\nII, pp. 543\u20138, at p. 543)\n\n\nMoritz continues that a beautiful object does not\nplease us, like a clock or a knife, because it satisfies some need of\nour own, not even the need to be pleased, but, remarkably, that\nthe beautiful needs us, in order to be\ncognized. We could subsist very well without the contemplations of\nbeautiful works of art, but these, as such, cannot well subsist\nwithout our contemplation.\n\n\nHe then goes on to say that when we see a play\nput on before an empty theater, we are displeased, not for the sake of\nthe author or actors, but for the sake of the play itself, as work of\nart whose need to be contemplated is going unfulfilled (ibid.,\np. 544)!\n\n\nIn a passage that points more toward Arthur Schopenhauer than to Kant,\nMoritz next writes:\n\n\nThe sweet astonishment, the agreeable forgetting of ourself\nin the contemplation of a beautiful work of art, is also a proof that\nour gratification here is something subordinate, that we voluntarily\nallow ourself to be determined through the beautiful, to which we for\na while concede a sort of sovereignty over all our own feelings.\nWhile the beautiful draws our consideration entirely to itself, it\ndraws us for a while away from our self, it is the highest degree of\npure and unselfish gratification that the beautiful affords us.  In\nthe moment we sacrifice our individual, limited existence to a sort of\nhigher existence. The gratification in the beautiful must thereby ever\nmore approach that of unselfish love if it is to be\ngenuine\u2026. The beautiful in the work of art is not for me pure\nand unmixed until I completely think away its special relation to me\nand consider it is as something that has been brought forth entirely\nfor its own sake, so that it could be something complete in itself.\n(Ibid., p. 545)\n\n\n\nAs the popularity of Schopenhauer\u2019s subsequent presentation of this\nview demonstrates, Moritz has surely here captured an aspect of the\nexperience of artistic\u2014or for that matter natural\u2014beauty\nthat many people have felt. But so far his conception of and argument\nfor the idea of the beautiful as that which is perfect and complete in\nitself has been entirely negative; what is it in a beautiful object\nthat can so please us and yet distract us completely from our ordinary\nconcern with ourselves and our own pleasures?\n\n\nThe answer to this question can be found in Moritz\u2019s longer\nessay On the formative Imitation of the Beautiful. Here,\nafter a more extended contrast between the beautiful, the useful, and\nthe good, Moritz adds to his previous account that a beautiful object\nis something that seems to us to be \u201ca whole subsisting for\nitself\u201d insofar as it \u201cstrikes our senses or can\nbe grasped by our imagination,\u201d and that \u201cto that\nextent our instruments of sensation prescribe\nits measure to the beautiful\u201d (\u00dcber die bildende\nNachahmung des Sch\u00f6nen, Werke, volume II, pp.\n551\u201378, at pp. 558\u20139). Here he aligns himself with the\ntradition of Wolff and Baumgarten by asserting that the perception of\nbeauty is a perception of perfection by means of the senses or their\nextension through imagination. But he still owes us an explanation of\nwhat the internal and objective perfection of the beautiful object is.\nThis comes next, when he states that it is actually the\n\u201cinterconnection of the whole of nature\u201d insofar as we\ngrasp it by means of the senses and imagination that we contemplate\nand admire in a beautiful work of art, or that it is intimated to us\nby such a work. \u201cEvery beautiful whole from the hand of the\nformative artist is thus a little impression of the highest beauty in\nthe great whole of nature\u201d (ibid., p. 560; see also\n\u201cGrundlinien,\u201d p. 592). The beautiful intimates the true\norder of the world-whole to us in a way that the use of our ordinary\npowers of thought, imagination, and sense on particular pieces of the\nworld-whole cannot do. Only in the experience of the\nbeautiful can we actually get a sense of the order of the\nworld-whole.\n\n\nFrom the premise that \u201cThe nature of the beautiful consists\nprecisely in the fact that its inner essence lies outside of the\nlimits of the power of thought, in its origination, in its own\ncoming-to-be,\u201d Moritz infers that \u201cin the case of the\nbeautiful, the power of thought can no longer ask, why is it\nbeautiful?\u201d (ibid., p. 564). The essence of beauty thus escapes\nordinary conceptual thought. This is the basis for Moritz\u2019s argument,\nin another essay entitled \u201cThe Signature of the\nBeautiful,\u201d that the beautiful cannot be described, that is,\nthat although words themselves may be beautiful, they cannot\nprovide a description of beauty\u2014even such a brilliant\ndescription as Winckelmann\u2019s description of the Apollo Belvedere\n\u201crips apart the wholeness of this work of art,\u201d and\n\u201cis more damaging than useful to the contemplation of this\nsublime work of art\u201d (\u201cDie Signatur des\nSch\u00f6nen,\u201d Werke, volume II, pp. 579\u201388, at p.\n588). And for this reason, the artistic genius cannot be fully\nconscious of what he does when he creates a beautiful work of art, for\nits beauty cannot be reduced to any concept that he can state (ibid.,\np. 585). Here Moritz arrives at results that are superficially similar\nto those Kant will arrive at a few years later\u2014that aesthetic\njudgments cannot be grounded in determinate concept and that the\nprocess of creation by artistic genius cannot be guided and explained\nby determinate concepts. But he reaches these conclusions for very\ndifferent reasons: Kant will draw these conclusions from his\nsubjectivist account of the origin of aesthetic pleasure in a play of\nthe cognitive powers that is free rather than determined by concepts,\nwhile Moritz draws these conclusions from his conception that a\nbeautiful object always intimates the order of the world-whole that is\nbeyond our grasp through any of the ordinary powers of mind. In other\nwords, Moritz draws his conclusions from his version of an aesthetics\nof truth, while Kant will draw similar conclusions from an aesthetics\nbased on the idea of the free play of mental powers.\n\n\nIn 1791, Moritz dedicated a review of the Essay on Taste by\n\u201cour mutual friend\u201d Herz to Salomon Maimon, another\nJewish intellectual who had arisen to prominence in\nBerlin from beginnings even more unpromising than those of Mendelssohn\nand Herz. Here he manifests his own allegiance to Wolff and\nBaumgarten, arguing that his conception of beauty as the internal\nperfection of a work of art as it strikes the senses and imagination\nis essentially the same as their conception of beauty as\n\u201csensible perfection\u201d (he draws no distinction between\nWolff and Baumgarten) (\u201c\u00dcber des Herrn Professor Herz Versuch\n\u00fcber den Geschmack: An Herrn Salomon Maimon,\u201d Werke,\nvolume II, pp. 923\u20137, at p. 925). In this work he also tries to\npaper over any difference between himself and Kant, whose Critique\nof the Power of Judgment had also appeared the year before, by\nclaiming that Kant\u2019s concept of \u201cpurposiveness without purpose\nis nothing other than an ideal purpose,\u201d and thus that Kant\u2019s\nconcept of beauty is essentially the same as Wolff\u2019s and his own\n(ibid., p.  926). This is not true, because Moritz\u2019s conception of the\nbeauty of an individual work of art is that it is an intimation of the\ntrue and objective order of nature as a whole, while Kant\u2019s notion of\npurposiveness without purpose is that of a subjective state of mind in\nwhich our mental powers of imagination and understanding are in a free\nharmony that does not by itself represent anything at all. At least in\nwhat Kant calls the \u201cpure\u201d judgment of taste, the\nexperience of beauty is pleasurable without meaning anything or\nconveying any truth. As we will see, that is in fact only the\nstarting-point of Kant\u2019s aesthetics, although as he moves past his initial\nanalysis of \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d beauty he does\nadd back into his view the beauties of truth that figured so\nprominently for so many of his German predecessors up through Herder\nand Moritz, as well as the beauty of utility that we saw to play a\nlarge r\u00f4le in the British tradition, for example in Hume. But we\ncannot appreciate the complexity of Kant\u2019s aesthetics unless we have\nseen the separate approaches that he ultimately combines.\n",
