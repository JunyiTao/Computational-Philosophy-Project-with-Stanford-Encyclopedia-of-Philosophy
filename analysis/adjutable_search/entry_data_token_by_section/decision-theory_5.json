Making real decisions\n\nThe vNM theorem is a very important result for measuring the strength\nof a rational agent\u2019s preferences over sure options (the\nlotteries effectively facilitate a cardinal measure over sure\noptions). But this does not get us all the way to making rational\ndecisions in the real world; we do not yet really have a decision\ntheory. The theorem is limited to evaluating options that come with a\nprobability distribution over outcomes\u2014a situation decision\ntheorists and economists often describe as \u201cchoice under\nrisk\u201d (Knight 1921).\n\nIn most ordinary choice situations, the objects of choice, over which\nwe must have or form preferences, are not like this. Rather,\ndecision-makers must consult their own probabilistic beliefs\nabout whether one outcome or another will result from a specified\noption. Decisions in such circumstances are often described as\n\u201cchoices under uncertainty\u201d (Knight 1921). For example,\nconsider the predicament of a mountaineer deciding whether or not to\nattempt a dangerous summit ascent, where the key factor for her is the\nweather. If she is lucky, she may have access to comprehensive weather\nstatistics for the region. Nevertheless, the weather statistics differ\nfrom the lottery set-up in that they do not determine the\nprobabilities of the possible outcomes of attempting versus not\nattempting the summit on a particular day. Not least, the mountaineer\nmust consider how confident she is in the data-collection procedure,\nwhether the statistics are applicable to the day in question, and so\non, when assessing her options in light of the weather.\n\nSome of the most celebrated results in decision theory address, to\nsome extent, these challenges. They consist in showing what conditions\non preferences over \u201creal world options\u201d suffice for the\nexistence of a pair of utility and probability functions\nrelative to which the agent can be represented as maximising expected\nutility. The standard interpretation is that, just as the utility\nfunction represents the agent\u2019s desires, so the probability\nfunction represents her beliefs. The theories are referred to\ncollectively as subjective expected utility (SEU) theory as\nthey concern an agent\u2019s preferences over prospects that are\ncharacterised entirely in terms of her own beliefs and desires (but we\nwill continue to use the simpler label EU theory). In this\nsection, two of these results will be briefly discussed: that of\nLeonard Savage (1954) and Richard Jeffrey (1965).\n\nNote that these EU decision theories apparently prescribe two things:\n(a) you should have consistent preference attitudes, and (b) you\nshould prefer the means to your ends, or at least you should prefer\nthe means that you assess will on average lead to your ends\n(cf. Buchak 2016). The question arises: What is the relationship\nbetween these prescriptions? The EU representation theorems\nthat will be outlined shortly seem to show that, despite appearances,\nthe two prescriptions are actually just one: anyone who has consistent\nattitudes prefers the means to her ends, and vice versa. But the\npuzzle remains that there are many ways to have consistent preference\nattitudes, and surely not all of these amount to preferring the means\nto one\u2019s own true ends. This puzzle is worth bearing in\nmind when appraising EU theory in its various guises; it will come up\nagain later.\n",
