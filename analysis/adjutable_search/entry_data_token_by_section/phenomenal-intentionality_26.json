    "main_text": "Challenges for PIT || Wide intentional states\n6.4 Unconscious occurrent states\n\nCognitive science posits various kinds of occurrent unconscious\nrepresentation, e.g., dorsal stream states and internal\nrepresentations of syntactic structures. It seems that such states\nhave intentional properties but lack phenomenal properties, so their\nintentionality cannot be phenomenal intentionality. \n\nSome supporters of PIT adopt an eliminativist strategy towards such\nunconscious states. Searle (1990, 1991, 1992) argues, roughly, for the\nclaim that only conscious or potentially conscious states exhibit\nintentionality. Since most unconscious states posited by cognitive\nscience are not potentially conscious, they are not intentional.\nSearle presents this view of unconscious states as being in conflict\nwith cognitive science. In contrast, Graham, Horgan, and Tienson\n(2007) and Mendelovici (2018) highlight the agreement between the\nassumptions of cognitive science and eliminativism about unconscious\nstates: everyone agrees that unconscious states play functional roles,\nbear tracking relations to things in the environment, and have no\nphenomenal properties. Everyone also agrees that it can be fruitful to\ntreat unconscious states as if they represented certain contents. The\nmain disagreement is over whether unconscious states really do qualify\nas intentional. \n\nBourget (2010, 2015) and Pitt (2009,\n Other Internet Resources)\n suggest that an inflationist strategy may be acceptable in case of at\nleast some unconscious occurrent states. On their views, we can have\nphenomenal states that we are not aware of. Unconscious occurrent\nstates could be such states.\n\nA derived content strategy is also an option in the case of some\nunconscious occurrent states. Bourget (2010) argues for this strategy\nby arguing for the claim that the low-level systems that allegedly support\nunconscious occurrent intentional states don\u2019t seem intentional\nwhen they are taken out of the organisms in which they belong.\nKriegel\u2019s interpretivism (2011a,b) is also meant to apply to\nunconscious occurrent states (see\n section 6.2).\n",
