    "main_text": "Responsibility and the Limits of Political Obligation\n9. Responsibility and the Limits of Political Obligation\n\nWhen subjects institute a sovereign by authorizing it, they agree, in\nconformity with the principle \u201cno wrong is done to a consenting\nparty\u201d, not to hold it liable for any errors in judgment it may\nmake and not to treat any harms it does to them as actionable\ninjustices. Although many interpreters have assumed that by\nauthorizing a sovereign, subjects become morally responsible for the\nactions it commands, Hobbes instead insists that \u201cthe external\nactions done in obedience to [laws], without the inward approbation,\nare the actions of the sovereign, and not of the subject, which is in\nthat case but as an instrument, without any motion of his own at\nall\u201d (Leviathan xlii, 106). It may be important to\nHobbes\u2019s project of persuading his Christian readers to obey\ntheir sovereign that he can reassure them that God will not hold them\nresponsible for wrongful actions done at the sovereign\u2019s\ncommand, because they cannot reasonably be expected to obey if doing\nso would jeopardize their eternal prospects. Hence Hobbes explains\nthat \u201cwhatsoever a subject...is compelled to do in obedience to\nhis sovereign, and doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order\nto the laws of his country, that action is not his, but his\nsovereign\u2019s.\u201d (Leviathan xlii. 11) This position\nreinforces absolutism by permitting Hobbes to maintain that subjects\ncan obey even commands to perform actions they believe to be sinful\nwithout fear of divine punishment.\n\nHobbes\u2019s description of the way in which persons should be\nunderstood to become subjects to a sovereign authority changes from\nhis Elements and De Cive accounts to his\nLeviathan account. In the former, each person lays down their\nrights (of self-government and to pursue all things they judge useful\nor necessary for their survival and commodious living) in favor of one\nand the same sovereign person (whether a natural person, as a monarch,\nor an artificial person, as a rule-governed assembly). In these\nearlier accounts, sovereigns alone retain their right of nature to act\non their own private judgment in all matters, and also exercise the\ntransferred rights of subjects. Whether exercising its own retained\nright of nature or the subjects\u2019 transferred rights, the\nsovereign\u2019s action is attributable to the sovereign itself, and\nit bears moral responsibility for it. In contrast, Hobbes\u2019s\nLeviathan account has each individual covenanting to\n\u201cown and authorize\u201d all of the sovereign\u2019s\nactions\u2014whatever the sovereign does as a public figure or\ncommands that subjects do. This change creates an apparent\ninconsistency in Hobbes\u2019s theory of responsibility for actions\ndone at the sovereign\u2019s command; if in \u201cowning\nand authorizing\u201d all their sovereign\u2019s actions, subjects\nbecome morally responsible for all that it does and all they do in\nobedience to its commands, Hobbes cannot consistently maintain his\nposition that merely obedient actions in response to sovereign\ncommands are the moral responsibility of the sovereign alone. One\nresolution of this apparent inconsistency denies that Hobbes\u2019s\nidea of authorization carries along responsibility for the act\nauthorized, as our contemporary idea of authorization generally does.\n\n\nWhile Hobbes insists that we should regard our governments as having\nabsolute authority, he reserves to subjects the liberty of disobeying\nsome of their government\u2019s commands. He argues that subjects\nretain a right of self-defense against the sovereign power, giving\nthem the right to disobey or resist when their lives are in danger. He\nalso gives them seemingly broad resistance rights in cases in which\ntheir families or even their honor are at stake. These exceptions have\nunderstandably intrigued those who study Hobbes. His ascription of\napparently inalienable rights\u2014what he calls the \u201ctrue\nliberties of subjects\u201d\u2014seems incompatible with his defense\nof absolute sovereignty. Moreover, if the sovereign\u2019s failure to\nprovide adequate protection to subjects extinguishes their obligation\nto obey, and if it is left to each subject to judge for herself the\nadequacy of that protection, it seems that people have never really\nexited the fearsome state of nature. This aspect of Hobbes\u2019s\npolitical philosophy has been hotly debated ever since Hobbes\u2019s\ntime. Bishop Bramhall, one of Hobbes\u2019s contemporaries, famously\naccused Leviathan of being a \u201cRebell\u2019s\nCatechism.\u201d More recently, some commentators have argued that\nHobbes\u2019s discussion of the limits of political obligation is the\nAchilles\u2019 heel of his theory. It is not clear whether or not\nthis charge can stand up to scrutiny, but it will surely be the\nsubject of much continued discussion.\n",
