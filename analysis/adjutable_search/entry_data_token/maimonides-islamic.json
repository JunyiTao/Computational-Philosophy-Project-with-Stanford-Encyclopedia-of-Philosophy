Rich and complex in their own right,\nMaimonides' writings must, however, be understood within their\n12th-13th century Islamicate context, revealing, as they do, the\nimprint of earlier Greek and Islamic philosophical traditions. In this\nentry, we will uncover some of the Islamic philosophical and\ntheological underpinnings of Maimonides' work with a focus on\nthe Theology of Aristotle, and the writings of al-Farabi\n(ca. 870-950), Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037), al-Ghazali (1058-1111),\nand Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126-1198).\n\n\nA few preliminary caveats and reminders:\n\n\n(a) It is not possible to cover every aspect of Maimonides' Islamic\nphilosophical heritage (even if we restrict ourselves to the\naforementioned text traditions) in a format of this sort; one might\ncertainly speak of other Islamic writers whose works arguably\ninfluenced Maimonides. To best do justice to this topic, I will\nproceed in what follows by selecting instructive and representative\nbits of primary text from Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed\n(henceforth, Guide), and comparing them with ideas from the\naforementioned texts. In this way, readers will be helped to see a\nselection of continuities in philosophical tradition between five\nimportant Islamic text traditions and Maimonides. By proceeding in\nthis way, I additionally hope to have supplied readers with\nappropriate Arabic philosophical resource materials for further\nstudy. It might be noted too that given my current goal of\nfacilitating as much active engagement on the part of as wide a range\nof readers as possible, I have limited the cited Arabic texts in this\nstudy to those that are currently available in English\ntranslation.\n\n\n(b) While I end with a selected bibliography of secondary readings,\nreaders ought to be aware in particular of Shlomo Pines' \u201cTranslator's\nIntroduction\u201d to his English translation of the Guide, a well-known\nand commonly cited essay in which he addresses the Greek and Islamic\nsources at play in Maimonides'\n thought.[1]\n While a classic resource, Pines\u2019 essay is\nsubject to scholarly debate (e.g. as we will see below, pace Pines,\nmore scholars are finding the direct influence of Averroes and\nal-Ghazali in Maimonides\u2019 Guide).\n\n\n(c) Finally, it ought also be noted in way of introduction that\nMaimonides' philosophy is, as we will see, deeply imbued with\nNeoplatonic metaphysical notions such as \u201cemanation\u201d (or \u201coverflow\u201d)\nand divine transcendence. While I will talk about these notions and\ntheir occurrence in Maimonides and in his Islamic philosophical\ncontext, and while I will try to give a basic sense of how these ideas\nwork, any attempt to fully explain these Plotinian metaphysical ideas\nfalls outside the scope of the current entry. In this respect, readers\nare invited to consult primary and secondary sources on Plotinus and\nNeoplatonic metaphysics in Greek, Jewish, and Islamic sources. \n", "toc": [{"#MethPre": "1.

Methodological Preamble\n\n\nHighlighting the importance of understanding Maimonides within the\ncontext of his Islamic intellectual milieu, Kraemer begins his\nmagisterial study of Maimonides\u2019 life and works with the following\nquote:\nWe are the children of our landscape. (Lawrence Durrell,\nJustine)\n\ngoing on to note that\n\nOnly when we read Arabic sources can we have a true picture of this\nperiod, identify the actors in this drama, and have reliable knowledge\nof circumstances and events. (Kraemer 2010, 15).\n\n\nIn this spirit, Kraemer\u2019s study draws strongly on Arabic historical,\nliterary, philosophical, and other sources to situate Maimonides\u2019\nthinking. Sensitive to this contextual approach, Pines begins his\nedition and translation of the Guide with a consideration of myriad\nIslamic (and Greek) philosophical sources, and while Hyman notes that\n\u201cit should not\u2026be inferred that medieval Jewish\nphilosophy was a branch of Islamic philosophy,\u201d he goes on to note\nthat \u201cby and large Jewish philosophy was a continuation of the\nphilosophy which flourished in the Islamic world\u201d (Hyman 1996,\n678-679). Sensitive to the impact of the Islamic context, Stroumsa\nreminds us that \u201c\u2026Maimonides was an avid reader, who took\npains to remain abreast of contemporary scholarship in general and\nphilosophical scholarship in particular\u2026 \u201d (Stroumsa\n2009, 173, n. 69), and \u201cthat Maimonides, who only rarely cited\nhis sources, read all he could find, and that he had no qualms about\nperusing the theological or legal works of non-Jews\u2026\u201d (Stroumsa\n2009, xii). Responding to Davidson\u2019s more conservative approach to\nreading sources into the \n text,[2]\n Stroumsa adds, \u201cMaimonides\u2019\nphilosophical erudition was no doubt far broader than would seem to be\nthe case only on the basis of his explicit references. We must\ntherefore be alert to the possibility that Maimonides\u2019 words reflect,\nwhether by way of acceptance or by way of reaction and criticism, his\nknowledge of the works of thinkers whose names are not explicitly\nmentioned\u201d (Stroumsa 2009, 24-5).\n\n2. Overview of Maimonides\u2019 Islamic Philosophical Backdrop: Theology of Aristotle and Beyond\n\n\nOne of the most important sources to keep in mind when reading\nMaimonides and Islamic medieval philosophers is the Theology of\nAristotle, a text that, while thought by Jewish and Islamic\nphilosophers to have been a work of Aristotle, was in fact an edited\nsummary of parts of books 4-6 of\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads.[3]\n Likely dated to the 9th century and edited\nby al-Kindi (and/or members of his circle), this text\u2014as well as\nthe rest of the Plotiniana Arabica and the Kal\u00e2m\nf\u00ee mahd al-khair (lit. the Discourse on the Pure\nGood, known to some in its later Latin translation as the Liber\nde Causis, or Book of\n Causes)[4]\u2014should\n be read in connection with any\nserious study of Maimonides.  In way of summary, we might highlight\nthe following key ideas in the Theology of Aristotle that play\nimportant roles for later Jewish and Islamic thinkers:\n\nGod is a pure unity who is pure goodness and pure being\nGod is creator, first cause of all beings\nGod emanates forth Intellect, then Soul, then Nature\n\n\n\nHere, we have a uniquely modified set of Plotinian insights that\nfeature prominently in Maimonidean thought. For Plotinus (following\nPlato\u2019s own highlighting of a Form of the Good over and above the Form\nof Being), God is himself a pure One identical to goodness per se, and\nis as such entirely above and beyond intellect and even entirely above\nand beyond being. In the Theology of Aristotle tradition God is\nidentified with pure unity and goodness, but is as such also\nidentified with a pure grade of being. And while the Theology of\nAristotle itself describes God as the maker of Intellect, as we\nmove into the reception of this tradition into al-Farabi and Avicenna,\nwe find that qua pure being and goodness God is also a pure\nintellect\u2014a point which adds a decidedly Aristotelian element to\nthe description of God. Thinkers such as Maimonides working within\nthe Theology of Aristotle and Aristotle traditions in this way\ncombine Plotinian and Aristotelian insights about God, mutually\nhighlighting the Plotinian sense of God as pure unity and the\nAristotelian sense of God as self-knowing intellect. Working within\nthis set of parameters, Maimonides and others are also helped to a\nsense of God as the ultimate cause of all being (and not simply a\npicture of God as a cause of motion, as one finds in Aristotle\nproper).\n\n\nThe Theology of Aristotle also introduces two critical insights\nabout creation which one finds too in al-Farabi and Avicenna:\n\nCreation is emanation\nGod creates/emanates in virtue of His onwmost essential goodness\n\n\n\nIn whatever way one winds up interpreting Maimonides\u2019 own view on\ncreation, it is important to bear in mind that he is writing in a\nphilosophical context in which there is plenty of strong precedent for\nidentifying the language of \u201ccreation\u201d (and even\n\u201ccreation ex nihilo\u201d) with the idea that God\neternally emanates forth in virtue of his ownmost essence as the pure\ngood (a point itself rooted in Plotinus in the idea of an\n\u201cunjealous\u201d God in Plato\u2019s Timaeus). It might be\nadditionally noted that in the Theology of Aristotle, this\nbountiful picture of God\u2014linked in a range of medieval Islamic\ntexts to the idea of God\u2019s generosity\u2014is also overtly linked to\nthe idea that God creates without thought or deliberation. While in\nand of itself (in another theological context) this might sound like\nan insulting way to describe God (i.e. \u201cthoughtless\u201d), in\nthe context at hand, it is part of the most honored and exalted way of\ndescribing God, emphasizing in particular just how essentially\ncreation flows from God\u2019s bountiful goodness. For God to deliberate\nabout creation in this context would be to make of creation an\nafterthought when, on the contrary, giving life to the world is here\nhighlighted as part and parcel of who God essentially is. We can find\nthis idea of \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d in a sense in even\nAvicenna\u2019s more Aristotelian description of God as an Intellect: even\nqua Intellect, Avicenna\u2019s God creates \u201cin virtue of His very\nessence,\u201d and not by a process of reasoning as we might\nunderstand it in human contexts.\n\n\nReflecting on our other sources, we ought to keep some starting points\nin mind:\n\n(a) Regarding al-Farabi: In what follows we will focus more on\nal-Farabi than on Avicenna and Averroes since al-Farabi is a thinker\nfor whom Maimonides expresses strong respect (citing him in the Guide\nmore than any other Islamic thinker; Rudavsky 2010, 7), but also\nbecause al-Farabi, as the earliest of these thinkers, exerted\ninfluence on many of the ideas in Avicenna, Averroes, and other\nIslamic philosophers.\n\n\n(b) Regarding Avicenna: While Avicennian notions can arguably be found\nin Maimonides, his view of the thinker is complicated. In a letter to\nIbn Tibbon, Maimonides clearly states that Avicenna's philosophy is of\nlesser value than al-Farabi's. That said, even in that context\nMaimonides characterizes Avicenna\u2019s ideas as subtle and exacting, and\nas worthy of study.[5]\n\n\n(c) Regarding Averroes: While we know that Maimonides held a great\nrespect for the writings of \n Averroes,[6]\n Pines and Ivry maintain that these writings\nwere most likely unknown to Maimonides until after the completion of\nhis Guide (Pines 1963, cviii). In contrast, W. Z. Harvey has explored\nthe resonance of Averroes in Guide 2.25 (W. Z. Harvey 1989), and\nStroumsa\u2014arguing that Maimonides had access to\nAverroes\u2019 Decisive Treatise and Exposition\u2014goes so\nfar as to suggest that \u201c\u2026the Guide can in some ways be seen as a\nreaction and answer to Averroes\u201d (Stroumsa 2009, 73). \n\n\n(d) Regarding al-Ghazali: While Pines concludes that Maimonides must\nhave been aware of al-Ghazali\u2019s work just in virtue of his\nintellectual context (e.g. Pines 1963, cxxvi-cxxxi), others go further\nand highlight particular textual resonances of al-Ghazali in\nMaimonides. While leaving open how Maimondies might have learned of\nGhazali\u2019s ideas, Davidson addresses al-Ghazali in Maimonides\u2019\ndiscussion of creation (Davidson 1979, esp. 28, 30, and 33), and also\ncites Maimonides\u2019 use of a particular image in al-Ghazali of a youth\nwho prefers toys to sexual pleasures in his attempt to describe our\nown inability as embodied humans to imagine the delights of the\nspiritual world,[7]\n S. Harvey argues for a link between\nMaimonides and Ghazali\u2019s respective \u201cBook(s) of Knowledge\u201d\n(Harvey 2005), Eran explores Ghazali and Maimonides on the World to\nCome (Eran 2001), Gil\u2018adi considers the possible relation between the\ntitle of Maimonides\u2019 magnum opus and al-Ghazali\u2019s description of God\nas \u201cguide of perplexed\u201d (dal\u012bl al-muta\u1e25ayyir\u012bn)\n(Gil'adi 1979), and Stroumsa not only identifies a reference to one of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s works in Maimonides\u2019 \u201cEpistle to Yemen\u201d\n(Stroumsa 2009, 25-26), but argues more broadly (69-70) for the impact\nof al-Ghazali on Maimonides through the influence of the Islamic\ntheologian/mystic on the Almohads under whose rulership Maimonides\nlived, and many of whose theological and legal principles, Stroumsa\nargues, were influential on Maimonides\u2019 thought. Stroumsa also argues\nthat if Maimonides knew Averroes\u2019 Fa\u1e63l al-maq\u0101l (as\nshe thinks he did), then \u201cit is also very likely that he was\nfamiliar with Ghazali\u2019s Fay\u1e63al al-tafriqa\u201d\n(Stroumsa 2009, 124).\n3. God\n\nLike his Islamic predecessors and contemporaries, Maimonides is keenly\ninterested in understanding the relationship between philosophy and\nreligion. In the context of such an inquiry, the attempt to understand\nGod is doubly important, since the idea of a divine being features\nprominently not only in religious tradition, but also as a\nfoundational element of both Neoplatonic and Aristotelian\nphilosophical theory.\n\n\nFollowing on Biblical, Neoplatonic and Aristotelian insights,\nMaimonides' God is an absolutely simple, absolutely necessary, and\ncompletely uncaused unity who is a pure intellect and first cause. As\nalready noted, Maimonides and many of his Islamic philosophical\npredecessors reveal a blend of Plotinian with non-Plotinian\nAristotelian ideas about God (and the cosmos more generally) under the\ninfluence of such texts as the Theology of Aristotle. Reading\nthis text as Aristotle's own, Maimonides and his Islamic predecessors\nhold a blend of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic views, including\nAristotelian views which are themselves often highly\nNeoplatonized. The blending together of God-as-pure-unity and\nGod-as-intellect is one such example. In these Neoplatonized\nAristotelian descriptions of God, we might place Maimonides in clear\nconversation with his Arabic philosophical predecessors.\n3.1 Simplicity: Unity, Essence=Existence, Necessity, Attributes, Apophasis, and \u201cActs\u201d\n\n\nMaimonides follows the Islamic Neoplatonic tradition of envisioning\nGod as the purest of unlimited being, a kind of pure being so utterly\nunified that it transcends any internal divisions. This theme can be\nclearly found in the Theology of Aristotle and in\nthe Kal\u00e2m f\u00ee ma\u1e25d al-khair in the identification of\nGod as \u201cPure Being\u201d or \u201cBeing Only,\u201d as well\nas in Almohad (see Stroumsa 2009) and Mu\u2018tazilite theology of the\ntime. It is this radical sense of unity that accounts for Maimonides'\nstrong negative theology (about which we will say more below): since\nGod is utterly and absolutely unified, He is a subject about whom we\ncan predicate nothing (since, after all, predication implies of a\nsubject that he is one thing or another, thus suggesting some\nlimitation). As such, God, as subject, transcends the normal\nparameters of language and conceptualization.\n\n\nOn the theme of divine unity, Maimonides stresses:\n\nHe, may He be exalted, is one in all respects; no multiplicity should\nbe posited in Him; there is no notion that is superadded to His\nessence (G 1.52, P 378)\n\nCompletely different from all other existents, Maimonides' God is\none in all respects, an idea mirroring the God of the Neoplatonic\nIslamic philosophers before him. Turning to al-Farabi, we find:\n\n\u2026[God's] distinction from all the others is due to a oneness\nwhich is its essence (al-dh\u0101t)\u2026Thus the\nFirst\u2026deserves more than any other one the name and meaning (of\n\u201cthe one\u201d ) (PS, 68-69)\n\nIn this same spirit of emphasizing the divine oneness, and\ndeveloping too an idea of God as the unique necessary existent,\nAvicenna explains of God that,\n\n\u2026it is not possible that the true nature which that whose\nexistence is necessary be composed of a multitude at all\u2026 (see\nHM, H 241)\n\n\nAvicenna concludes further along these lines that God, the being whose\nexistence is necessary, is \u201ca unity, while everything else is a\ncomposite duality\u201d (see HM, H 247). To draw out the idea of\nGod's unity, Avicenna emphasizes that God alone is the essence that is\none with existence, whereas all other things enjoy an existence that\nis, on the contrary, separate from their essence. In speaking about\nthis feature of non-God subjects, Avicenna speaks of existence being\nadded to essence, a claim that has often wrongly been interpreted as\nsuggesting that existence is for Avicenna literally an accident (see\nRahman 1958; Morewedge 1972). The details of this misreading aside,\nthe echo of this Avicennian insight can certainly be heard in\nMaimonides' own description of existence as \u201can accident\nattaching to what exists,\u201d as well as in his repeatedly claiming\n(as above) that there is no \u201csuperadded notion\u201d to God's\npurely singular and unchanging essence (G 1.57, P 132). Maimonides\nfurther emphasizes along these lines that attributes used to describe\nGod are \u201cremote from the essence of the thing of which it is\npredicated,\u201d and that such descriptions do not at all signify\n\u201cdiffering notions subsisting within the essence of the\nagent\u201d (G 1.52, P 378). Further mirroring the Avicennian ideas\nof divine necessity and essential unity, Maimonides adds:\n\n\u2026As for that which has no cause for its existence, there is\nonly God, may He be magnified and glorified, who is like that. For\nthis is the meaning of our saying about Him, may He be exalted, that\nHis existence is necessary. Accordingly, His existence is identical\nwith His essence and His true reality, and His essence is His\nexistence. Thus His essence does not have an accident attaching to it\nwhen it exists, in which case its existence would be a notion that is\nsuperadded to it\u2026Consequently He exists, but not through an\nexistence other than His essence\u2026 (G 1.57, P 132)\n\nMaimonides here and elsewhere echoes Avicenna's idea of God as\n\u201cnecessary being\u201d\u2014literally, \u201cThe Necessary of\nExistence\u201d (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd)\u2014whose\nessential nature it is to exist, and who, as such, does not rely on\nanother for His existence. Maimonides' God is, to use the language of\nAvicenna, the proven existent which \u201cwhen it is considered in\nitself, has its existence by necessity\u201d and which, as such, has\nno cause (HM, H 241).\n\nOn the theme of divine simplicity, it is also worth considering the\ntheological context in which Maimonides' denial of divine accidents\nand attributes takes place. A center-stage issue in Quran exegesis,\nthe theme of divine attributes\u2014or lack thereof\u2014was the\nsubject of much heated debate among Islamic theologians in Maimonides'\nimmediate context. While Maimonides is extremely critical of the\ndialectical methods of the Kalam theologians (accusing them, for\nexample, of using imagination instead of intellect to come to their\nconclusions about God), in stressing God's unity through the\nparticular idea that God does not have \u201cdiffering notions\u201d\nsubsisting in His essence, Maimonides is in step with those Kalam\ntheologians in his Islamic milieu who stress, above all, the absolute\nunity of God and His lack of \nattributes.[8] Reflecting on Maimonides\u2019 upholding the\njoint ideas that God is absolutely one and that God has no body,\nStroumsa argues for the influence of Almohadic legal theory and\ntheology on Maimonides\u2014a point seen too in his support for\nmandating belief in God's unity by\n law.[9]\n\n\nFollowing on the theme of God's unity, Maimonides emerges as a strong\nproponent of apophatic discourse, sometimes referred to as\n\u201cnegative theology,\u201d which is a mode of talking about God\nwith the sensitivity that, since God admits of no multiplicity, we\ncannot meaningfully (at least not in any straightforward or literal\nsense) ascribe any traits to Him. The very act of predication involved\nin attributions (formulas of the form \u201cGod is\u2026 \u201d)\nare doomed to failure in the light of God's utter unity. To approach\nGod apophatically is, hence, to approach God with a heightened\nsensitivity to the failures of language to say very much about Him at\nall. This is called \u201cnegative theology\u201d in the sense that\nclaims about God (with the exception of such claims as \u201cthat He\nexists,\u201d and \u201cthat He is pure being, pure goodness, and\npure wisdom qua pure intellect\u201d) are seen as never actually\ntelling us anything substantive about God. At best we can come to\nunderstand what God is not. For example, Maimonides affirms that\n\u201canything that entails corporeality ought of necessity to be\nnegated in reference to Him and that all affection likewise should be\nnegated in reference to him\u201d (G 1.55, P 128). For Maimonides,\nGod \u201ccannot have an affirmative attribute in any respect,\u201d\nand so, affirmative predications about God cannot be taken as\ninforming us about God's essential reality (G 1.58, P 135). As such,\npositive attributions about God actually bring one further away\nfrom\u2014not closer to\u2014an understanding of the divine:\n\nKnow that when you make an affirmation ascribing another thing to Him,\nyou become more remote from Him in two respects: one of them is that\neverything you affirm is a perfection only with reference to us, and\nthe other is that He does not possess a thing other than His\nessence\u2026 (G 1.59, P 139)\n\n\nFor Maimonides, language is limited in its ability to capture God's\nessence: \u201cwhen the tongues aspire to magnify Him by means of\nattributive qualifications, all eloquence turns into weariness and\nincapacity!\u201d (G 1.58, P 137).\n\n\nIt is in this spirit that Maimonides takes great pains to point out\nhow the Bible itself, in its various detailed positive attributions\nabout God, is not to be taken at face value. Maimonides explains that\nBiblical descriptions of divine \u201ctraits\u201d are not to be\nseen as telling us anything about God's essential reality, but,\nrather:\n\n\u2026the numerous attributes possessing diverse notions that figure\nin the Scripture and that are indicative of Him, may he be exalted,\nare mentioned in reference to the multiplicity of His actions and not\nbecause of a multiplicity subsisting in His essence, and some of them,\nas we have made clear, also with a view to indicating His perfection\naccording to what we consider as perfection (G 1.52, P 119)\n\n\nTo describe God is, here, to describe the effects God's being has on\n(or in) the world of humans. If we speak of God's mercy, we are\nspeaking not of God's essential reality, but of the ways in which\nGod's essential reality is manifest in the world\u2014manifest, that\nis, in the well-ordered design of this world that, to the human mind,\nappears worthy of, for example, the designation\n\u201cmerciful\u201d. One example Maimonides gives is of the\nwell-ordered design of the embryo which is supplied with all needed\nprotection and nourishment and with all the wonders that one can find\nin a study of biology, physiology, and\nembryology.[10]\nWhile this kind of ordered design does not suggest for Maimonides that\nGod has the attribute of mercy, it is indeed for him a manifestation\nof God\u2019s essential wisdom and goodness. When this kind of ordered\ndesign leads one to claim that \u201cGod is merciful,\u201d what is\nreally being reflected is not that God has the attribute of mercy but\nthat the wise order of the world\u2014stemming from God\u2019s own\nessential wisdom and goodness\u2014is, qua well-thought through\ndesign that accommodates the embryo\u2019s every need ensuring its health\nand nourishment, something that in the case of humans would well stem\nfrom the attribute of mercy. Denying attributes to God follows, for\nMaimonides, from a proper awareness of the nature of divine unity (as\nan essential and trait-less being as wisdom as goodness). This\ntogether with the idea that scriptural claims about God are not to be\ntaken at face value can be found in earlier Islamic philosophical\ntradition as well. We will return to this theme below\n[see Section 7].\n\n\nIt is worth noting a strong affinity between Maimonides\u2019 understanding\nof God\u2019s manifestness in the order of nature and Averroes\u2019 conception\nof God and providence which focuses heavily on God\u2019s essential\npreservation of all species, and his role as the cause of being and\nunity in all hylomorphic substances. Emphasizing God\u2019s relation in\nthis regard to nature, Averroes speaks of\n\nthe divine mind which is like the single form of the single commanding\nart to which various arts are subordinated. Accordingly, one must\nunderstand that nature, when it produces something very highly\norganized without itself being intelligent, is inspired by active\npowers which are nobler than it and are called \"intellect\". (CAM\n1502-3, G 111]\n\nEnvisioning, with Aristotle, a series of separate intellects moving\nthe various celestial spheres, Averroes, commenting on Aristotle,\nspeaks of sublunar nature being actualized by stars\u2019 heat, the stars\u2019\nheat being generated by the separate intellects, and these separate\nintellects as ultimately being moved by God (through the separate\nintellects\u2019 desire for God, their final cause). As Averroes notes in\nthe lines leading up to the preceding quote:\n\nAs for the heats generated by the heats of the stars, which produce\n each distinct species of animals and which are potentially that\n species of animal, the power present in each one of these heats\n depends on the amount of the motions of the stars and their\n reciprocal proximity or remoteness; this power originates from the\n work of the divine mind\u2026 [CAM 1502, G 111]\n\n\nIn this way, Averroes can be seen to envision God (the \u201cdivine\nmind,\u201d or we might say, divine wisdom) in the very contours of\nterrestrial and celestial \nnature.[11]\n This Averroean model can in many ways be\nseen throughout Maimonides\u2019 Guide.\n3.2 God as Intellect\n\n\nFor Maimonides, God is a pure knower described in Aristotelian terms\nas purely actualized intellect and as the act of knowing that knows\nitself.\n\n\nAs we have already seen, following a Plotinian notion of divine\ntranscendence alongside an Aristotelian sense of God as a fully\nactualized Intellect, Maimonides and his Islamic predecessors and\ncontemporaries describe God as an absolutely pure and undivided unity,\nand as a perfected, fully actualized Intellect (in this latter way\nprima facie deviating from Plotinus\u2019 own sense of God as \u201cabove\nbeing\u201d and \u201cbeyond intellect\u201d). The notion of God as\nIntellect, rooted in Aristotle's own works, contrasts intellects which\nare less perfected with those which are more (or, in the case of God,\nfully) perfected in terms of lesser and greater degrees of actuality:\nwhile a lesser intellect is characterized at any given time by some\ndegree of not-yet-actualized-potentiality (which is to say, it doesn't\nyet know everything), the intellect of God alone\u2014being in a\nconstant and unchanging state of complete knowledge\u2014is described\nas being entirely devoid of unactualized potencies, residing always in\na state of pure actualization.\n\n\nWe can certainly see this Aristotelian emphasis on the \u201cGod as\nknower\u201d theme in al-Farabi, for whom God is \u201cthe first\ncause, the first intellect, and the first living\u201d (al-sabab\nal-awwal wal-\u2018aql al-awwal wal-\u1e25ayy al-awwal) (PS,\n81). As \u201cfirst cause\u201d God is the ontological foundation of\nall being; as \u201cfirst intellect\u201d He is the repository of\nall knowledge and final cause of all knowing; and as \u201cfirst\nliving\u201d He is the source of life itself. Emphasizing the idea of\nGod's unique ontological status, Al-Farabi elaborates:\n\nThe First Existent (al-mawj\u016bd al-awwal) is the First Cause\n(al-sabab al-awwal) of the existence of all the other\nexistences (PS 56). It is free of every kind of deficiency\u2026Thus\nits existence is the most excellent and precedes every other\nexistence\u2026It can in no way have existence potentially, and\nthere is no possibility whatever that it should not exist\u2026It is\nthe existent for whose existence there can be no cause\u2026 (PS 57)\n\nGod is uncaused and admits of no unactualized potency; he is pure\nact and necessary existent.\n\n\nAdding to this idea of God, and following further on an Aristotelian\ntheme of God as pure knowing that knows\nitself,[12]\nMaimonides adds:\n\nNow when it is demonstrated that God, may He be held precious and\nmagnified, is an intellect in actu (\u2018aql bil-fi\u2018l; Munk\n1931, 114, line 4) and that there is absolutely no potentiality in\nHim\u2014as is clear and shall be demonstrated\u2014so that He is\nnot by way of sometimes apprehending and sometimes not apprehending\nbut is always an intellect in actu, it follows necessarily that\nhe and the thing apprehended are one thing, which is His essence\n(dh\u0101t). Moreover, the act of apprehension owing to which\nHe is said to be an intellectually cognizing subject is in itself the\nintellect, which is His essence. Accordingly, He is always the\nintellect (al-\u2018aql) as well as the intellectually\ncognizing subject (al-\u2018\u0101qil) and the intellectually\ncognized object (al-ma\u2018aq\u016bl)\u2026 (G 1.68, P 165;\nArabic at Munk 1931, 114)\n\n\nIn Maimonides' idea of God's pure activity of intellection, we are\nreminded of Al-Farabi's own Aristotelian account. Not to be confused\nwith \u201cactive intellect\u201d (to which we will return below),\nGod (\u201cthe First\u201d) is described by Al-Farabi as an\n\u201cintellect in actu,\u201d or, an \u201cactual\nintellect\u201d (al-\u2018aql bil-fi\u2018l, literally, the\nintellect \u201cin act,\u201d or \u201cactualized\u201d) (PS\n70). Following on this idea, and mirrored most evidently in the quote\nfrom Maimonides above, Farabi follows Aristotle in describing God as\nthe thinking subject who thinks himself:\n\n\u2026for the One whose identity\n(ipseitas; h\u016bwiyya) is intellect is intelligible by\nthe One whose identity is intellect (PS 70). In order to be\nintelligible the First is in no need of another essence outside itself\nwhich would think it but it itself thinks its own essence. As a result\nof its thinking its own essence, it becomes actually thinking and\nintellect, and, as a result of its essence thinking (intelligizing)\nit, it becomes actually intelligized\u2026[It] is intellect and\nthinking by thinking its own essence\u2026[In the case of God, the\nFirst], the intellect (al-\u2018aql), the thinker\n(al-\u2018\u0101qil) and the intelligible (and intelligized)\n(al-ma\u2018q\u016bl) (PS 70) have\u2026one meaning and are\none essence and one indivisible substance (PS 71-3)\n\nIt is precisely this Aristotelian description of God (as subject\nand object of the pure act of knowing), together with a heightened\nNeoplatonic sensitivity to God's unity (arguably seen more\nemphatically in Avicenna than even in al-Farabi) which grounds\nMaimonides' own understanding of the divine.\n\n\nThis same identification of God as pure act can also be seen in\nAverroes who shares with his Neoplatonic Islamic philosophers and\nMaimonides a sense of God\u2019s purity of act, as can be seen in his\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, and the sense there of\nGod as:\n\nthe first mover [who] is eternal, substance, pure actuality and free\nfrom matter [CAM 1599, G 151].\n\n3.3 On the Tension/Interplay of Immanence and Transcendence\n\n\nAlongside his emphasis on God's utter unchanging and utterly\ntranscendent unity, Maimonides also describes God as the creator and\ncause of all existence, a notion which seems to bring Him into more\ndirect and immanent contact with the universe (as we have seen in\nAverroes\u2019 account in section 3.1 above). For thinkers like al-Farabi,\nAvicenna (and arguably, Maimonides) who emphasize a more robust sense\nof emanation than is found in Averroes and with it a more robust sense\nof God\u2019s transcendence, there arises a philosophical tension (or\nperhaps we might say interplay) between God-as-transcendent (as the\nemanating source of all being) and God-as-immanent (as the power\nmanifest in the workings of the universe). A tension/interplay can\nalso be seen more broadly as a feature of Islamic and Jewish\nNeoplatonized accounts (including both Avicenna\u2019s more transcendent\nand Averroes\u2019 less transcendent accounts) in which the more\ntranscendent Greek Plotinian idea of a divine source so unified that\nHe is at once above intellect as well as \u201cbeyond being\u201d is\nbrought together with the less transcendent Aristotelian notion of God\nwho is the pure being of perfected intellect.\n\n\nWe might also note that in the tension/interplay of divine immanence\nand transcendence in Maimonides\u2019 Guide, we might discern affinities\nfor each of the (competing) ideas of Avicenna and Averroes, the former\nemphasizing God\u2019s transcendence, and the latter identifying God as an\nimmanent first mover. Sometimes Maimonides\u2019 knowing God is emphasized\nmore immanently as \u201cthe form of the world\u201d (G 1.69, P\n166), and as the mover of the first sphere (G 1.72; G 2.1). Other\ntimes, Maimonides\u2019 knowing God is emphasized in His\ntranscendence\u2014as even more transcendent than the rest of the\nseparate cosmic intellects, with the reminder at Guide 2.4 that God is\nnot to be identified as mover of the first\nsphere.[13]\n\n\nCommenting on the dual description of God-as-immanent and\nGod-as-transcendent, Maimonides concludes at Guide 1.72,\n\nOn the one hand, there is a demonstration of His separateness, may He\nbe exalted, from the world and of His being free from it; and on the\nother hand, there is a demonstration that the influence of His\ngovernance and providence in every part of the\nworld\u2026exists\u2026 (G 1.72, P 193)\n\n\n(Given, though, that the rest of this chapter talks in Avicennian\n terms about the emanating divine overflow as it is found in active\n intellect (see sections 5\n and 6 below for more on the\n \u201cdivine overflow\u201d and \u201cactive intellect\u201d),\n and given that providence is to be understood in terms of a human\n being's own relationship\u2014via intellect\u2014to this emanating\n active intellect (as becomes clear elsewhere in the Guide (e.g. G\n 3.52, P 624-6), the overall weight of Maimonides' might be seen to\n lie with Avicenna on the side of a transcendent, emanating God).\n4. Cosmos, Creation, Emanation\n\n\nFollowing in the Greek and Islamic traditions before him, Maimonides\nsets out to carefully investigate the workings of the\nworld\u2014including terrestrial, celestial, and purely metaphysical\nrealities. Based on our consideration of divine \u201cacts\u201d\nabove, we can see how even investigations into the workings of\ncorporeal nature can be seen as having explicitly theological\nsignificance in a Maimonidean context. In this spirit, Maimonides can\nbe seen as finding value in the cosmological argument at play in\nAristotle and Averroes according to which the workings of the world\ngive rise to a proof for the existence of God as a first mover\n(though, it might be noted, that Maimonides, along with al-Farabi,\nAvicenna\u2014and, in a somewhat different sense,\nAverroes\u2014credits God with being the cause not only of motion,\nbut of existence as well). In this way, even studying the workings of\nnature can be seen in the service of theology\u2014a point borne out\nfurther when we consider our above discussion of Maimonides and\nAverroes on God\u2019s manifest role in the order of nature. In this\nregard, we might note that Maimonides goes so far as to describe\ndivine actions at 2.32 as natural actions. Furthermore, in a context\nwhere God Himself cannot be known per se and where (as we\nhave seen above) descriptions of God are best understood as describing\nnot God, but the effects of God in the world (that is, the\nmanifestation of God\u2019s wisdom and goodness in the well-ordered design\nand workings of nature), a study of how the world works can be seen as\na study of God's actions (and as such, as an attempt to better get to\nknow God). As Maimonides makes clear, \u201cThere is\u2026no way to\napprehend Him except\u2026through the things He has made\u2026\u201d (G 1.34, P\n74).\n\n \nIn relation to the cosmos, it is clear that Maimonides' God stands as\nfirst cause and source for all existence. Far less, clear, however, is\nMaimonides' precise understanding of what God's role as \u201cfirst\ncause and source for all existence\u201d\u2014His role, that is, as\nCreator\u2014amounts to. (For an overview of key Arabic creation\nterms at play in Maimonides\u2019 Islamic milieu as well as in his Jewish\nNeoplatonic context, the reader is well-served to consult\nthe Encyclopaedia of Islam entries\non ibd\u0101\u2018, khalq, \u1e25ud\u016bth\nal-\u2018al\u0101m; see too Altman and Stern on Neoplatonic\ncreation terms in Israeli\u2019s lexicon (including\nalso al-ikhtir\u0101\u2018) and their relation to Greek and\nIslamic text traditions, including al-Kindi (Almann and Stern 1958;\nsee Israeli\u2019s Book of Definitions 66-68, with comments at\n68-74).\n\nAt Guide 2.13, Maimonides seems, at least prima facie, to embrace a\ndoctrine of creation ex nihilo:\n\n\n\u2026the opinion of all who believe in the Law of Moses our Master,\npeace be on him, is that the world as a whole\u2014I mean to say,\nevery existent other than God, may He be exalted\u2014was brought\ninto existence by God after having been purely and absolutely\nnonexistent, and that God, may He be exalted, had existed alone, and\nnothing else\u2014neither an angel nor a sphere nor what subsists\nwithin the sphere. Afterwards, through His will and His volition, He\nbrought into existence out of nothing all the beings as they are, time\nitself being one of the created things\u2026\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of 2.13, this view is contrasted with two other\ncosmogonical views: 1) creation ex aliquo (i.e., the Platonic\ncosmogony on which God invests an eternally existing material\nsubstrate with forms); and 2) the Aristotelian position that the world\nis eternal. Suffice it to say that there is much scholarly debate over\nthe exact nature of Maimonides' true view on creation. First of all,\nthere are theorists (following in the tradition of Leo Strauss) who\nview Maimonides as committed to esoteric writing strategies rooted in\nsocio-political considerations\u2014essentially, on such a view,\nMaimonides will often be seen to have written the exact opposite of\nwhat he truly believed. For these theorists, the stated view of\nMaimonides will almost always be in extreme contrast to his true,\nunstated view [for a related discussion,\nsee Section 7].  Applying this theoretical\nstarting point to the case at hand, the fact that Maimonides seems to\nembrace creation ex nihilo would suggest to some that he\ntruly believed in Aristotelian eternity, the opposite\nview.[14]\n\n\n\nThere are, though, other compelling reasons to question Maimonides'\nview of creation. Leaving aside, that is, any particular commitments\nto Straussian writing strategies, we might simply note that\nMaimonides' own treatment of creation and its various sub-themes seems\nto leave room for interpretation, oftentime admitting of\nambiguous\u2014and even changing\u2014details. Careful readings and\nre-readings of the Guide seem to support more than one way of\nunderstanding the precise nature of and relationship between such\nconcepts as: creation [simpliciter], creation ex\nnihilo, creation ex aliquo, creation taken in a temporal\nsense, creation taken in a non-temporal sense, continuous creation,\nontological dependency, emanation, and will, among other inter-related\nconcepts. \u201cWill,\u201d for example, is sometimes described as a\nfeature of creation ex nihilo, but other times seems to\nemerge as a feature of \u201ccreation\u201d more broadly; but, as we\nhave seen earlier in our discussion of The Theology of\nAristotle, in Maimonides' philosophical context\n\u201ccreation\u201d (and even \u201ccreation ex\nnihilo\u201d) might in theory be used to describe even\nNeoplatonic eternal \n emanation[15]\n or Aristotelian eternity viewed in a\ncertain way (for the explicit reconciliation of creation language with\ndoctrines of eternity in Maimonides' immediate philosophical milieu,\nsee Averroes). And so, scholarly debates about Maimonides' true view\non this matter abound: while some attribute to him a view of creation\nin time, others find in Maimonides a secret belief in Platonic\ncreation ex aliquo (Davidson 1979, 16-40), a secret belief in\nthe Aristotelian view of eternity, or a belief in the identity between\nthe notion of Biblical creation and Aristotelian eternity\n(W. Z. Harvey 1981).\n\n\n\nWhatever his ultimate view, Maimonides certainly engages the idea of\ncreation, describing God as the Creator (a description that is, of\ncourse, also used in the Theology of Aristotle tradition in a\nway that has nothing to do with the Bible, and nothing to do with\n\u201ccreation in time\u201d):\n\n\nFor the universe exists in virtue of the existence of the Creator, and\nthe latter continually endows it with permanence in virtue of the\nthing that is spoken of as overflow\u2014as we shall make clear in\none of the chapters of this Treatise\u2026 (G 1.69, P 168)\n\n\n\n\nHere, God emerges as the cause (in at least some sense) of the world's\nexistence. We see here too an emphasis on the continuous relationship\nbetween God and the world in this regard: As cause of the world's\n\u201cpermanence,\u201d God is a continual sustainer. Here too, we\nlearn of the idea of a cosmic overflow, an idea to which we will\nreturn below.\n\n\nLooking to his Islamic context, it is important always keep in mind\nthat describing God as the source and cause of being (and even\ndescribing God as a \u201ccreator\u201d) can mean very different\nthings, and so care must be taken not to assume we know what\nMaimonides is talking about just because his God is a creating source\nand cause.  Describing God as a cause of being, or as a creator, or\neven as a creator ex nihilo might mean\u2014as it does in\nal-Kindi\u2014that He brings about the existence of the world in time\n(in this way standing in clear opposition to an Aristotelian view of\neternity or a Plotinian view of emanation), or it might mean something\nelse entirely: It might mean for instance that God is an eternal\nontological source. This idea can be seen in Avicenna for whom God is\nthe Being eternally engaged in an ongoing process of emanation, and in\nthis way eternally generating existence itself. This idea of\nGod-as-source can be seen too in a somewhat different way in Averroes\nfor whom God-as-creator is the eternal-ontological source, the\nAristotelian uncaused cause who eternally sustains the universe\nand\u2014absent an Avicennian process of emanationist\nintermediation\u2014is the constant productive source\u2014and in\nthis sense, the creator\u2014of cosmic existence (see Leaman 1988,\nesp. 42-71 and Davidson 1987; see too Taylor 2012a, Other Internet\nResources).  Averroes in this regard champions an ab aeterno\ngeneration which can in part be characterized as\nnot-quite-a-creation-view, and can in part be characterized as\nnot-quite-an-eternity-view (depending, of course, on what one means by\nthose terms):\n\n\nBut in truth it [i.e. the world] is neither truly generated, nor is it\ntruly eternal. For what is truly generated is necessarily corruptible,\nand what is truly eternal has no cause\u2026Thus the doctrines about\nthe world are not all so far apart from one another that some of them\nshould be charged as unbelief and others not. (DT sections 19-20, B\n15-16)\n\n\n\nAccording to Averroes, it is important to acknowledge that the\nexistence of the world has a cause, and so any philosophical account\nof eternity that suggests otherwise won't do, whereas it is equally\nimportant to recognize that existence itself along with time\n\u201cextend continuously at both extremes,\u201d and so, any\nunreflective religious commitment to origination in time won't\ndo. Exposing the weaknesses in holding either that the world is\ncreated in time (muhdath) or that it is eternal (in the sense\nof \u201cuncaused\u201d), Averroes instead upholds a notion of the\nworld's being \u201cgenerated ab aeterno.\u201d\n\n\nFor Avicenna and for Averroes\u2014though in different ways\u2014the\nidea of eternity does not exclude talking about the existence of the\nuniverse as a created effect of God: for Avicenna, God is the\n\u201ccause of being\u201d in the sense that He is the eternally\nemanating source of being, whereas for Averroes, God is the\n\u201ccause of being\u201d in the sense of an ab aeterno\nnon-emanative source of generation. Maimonides\u2014given all of his\novert talk of emanation (fay\u1e0d) in the Guide\u2014would\nseem best grouped with Avicenna on this issue, though as we have seen\nabove, other aspects of his view of God\u2019s role in the universe\nresonate strongly with Averroes. To be sure, the exact nature of\nMaimonides\u2019 view\u2014and the extent of its similarities to and/or\ninfluences from the views of Avicenna and Averroes\u2014seems\nreasonably open to debate. Given the subtle interplay of the notions\nof emanation, creation, eternal sustenance, and ontological causal\ngrounding\u2014in addition to Maimonides' own arguably ambiguous\nclaims about creation\u2014it is difficult to know for sure what\nMaimonides is advocating, even when he is advocating\n\u201ccreation.\u201d\n\n\nAdding to the conceptual complexity, one might note too that there\nare, in Maimonides' own Islamic context, debates about just how to\nunderstand the Quranic description of a Creator God. While Quran II,\n117 and VI, 101 describe God as the Bad\u012b\u2018, or\nAbsolute Creator, it is unclear exactly what is meant by the activity\nof ibd\u0101\u2018 (absolute creation, or innovation) and\nhow it relates to an act of\nikhtir\u0101\u2018 (invention, origination, or making \nanew).[16]\n Looking to certain Islamic interpretations of God's creative role as\ndescribed in the Quran, the idea of \u201ccreation  ex nihilo\n \u201d can be seen to fall away in light of Quranic verses\u2014such as\nQuran XI, 7 (\u201c\u2026and His throne was on the\nwater\u2026\u201d) and XLI, 2 (\u201cThen He directed Himself\ntowards the sky, and it was smoke\u201d)\u2014which can be taken\n(as they are by\n Averroes; see DT section 21, B 16), \n as overtly signifying substances co-eternal with\nGod (such as the \u201csmoke\u201d of XLI, 2 taken as denoting an\neternally co-existing something). For Averroes, the meaning of the\nQuran on creation is that \u201c[the world's] form really is\ngenerated, whereas being itself and time extend continuously at both\n extremes\u2026\u201d (DT section 21, B 16). \n Along these lines, we might note that there is no reason that the\nambiguity (or openness) of what the Quran means in its description of God should\nnot have carried through to Maimonides' own thoughts on the Biblical\naccount, where the philosophically relevant details of God's Genesis\nact of creation (br\u012b\u2019ah) are arguably left unspecified and open to interpretation.\n\n\nSeen in this context, interpreting Maimonides' own views on\ncreation\u2014including difficulties in ascertaining what on his view\ncounts as \u201cthe Biblical account\u201d of creation\u2014is\ndifficult. We might add a further difficulty: Maimonides' overall\ntreatment of creation is tempered by his acknowledgement (G 2.16) that\nthe question of creation v. eternity is an open question\u2014in\nother words, there is no conclusive proof, according to Maimonides,\nfor creation and no conclusive proof for eternity (a claim which can\nbe seen too in Averroes'\nTah\u0101fut, 1st discussion, 1st\n proof).\n In this spirit, Maimonides offers the following summary of a chapter\nin which the creation question has been considered:\n\n\nTo sum up: Nothing in the methods we have set forth in this chapter is\ncapable either of establishing an opinion [about the eternity of the\nworld] as correct or of proving it false or of arousing doubts with\nregard to it\u2026 (G 2.15, P 292)\n\n\n5. Overflow\n\n\nReturning to our earlier citation, we find in Maimonides' description\nof God's creative act the idea of a cosmic overflow:\n\n\nFor the universe exists in virtue of the existence of the Creator, and\nthe latter continually endows it with permanence in virtue of the\nthing that is spoken of as overflow\u2014as we shall make clear in\none of the chapters of this Treatise\u2026 (G 1.69, P 168)\n\n\n\n\nRelated to the question of God's ontologically grounding relationship\nto the cosmos, there emerges not only in Maimonides but in his Islamic\nphilosophical context, an emanationist notion of divine\n\u201coverflow\u201d which incorporates\u2014and, as it were, tries\nto reconcile\u2014certain Aristotelian ideas about cosmic separate\nintellects (see De Anima 3.5, as well as Metaphysics\n\u039b)[17]\ntogether with overtly Neoplatonic ideas found in the Theology of\nAristotle. For al-Farabi, as for Avicenna, the cosmic overflow\nis, in particular, a series of 10 emanating separate intellects, each\nlinked to its own celestial sphere (and in turn to the various planets\nwhich respectively occupy those spheres), with the lowest of these\nseparate intellects being al-\u2018aql\nal-fa\u2018\u2018\u0101l, the \u201cactive intellect\u201d\n(or: \u201cagent intellect\u201d). For al-Farabi and Avicenna, the\nactive intellect is seen as the emanating source and support of the\nentire sublunar realm, and also as the source for all human knowledge,\nincluding prophecy. In the Arabic philosophical tradition, this active\nintellect is further identified with the \u201cseparate\nintellect\u201d spoken of by Aristotle at De Anima 3.5\n(though, other Islamic philosophers\u2014such as Averroes, as well as\nancient Greek commentators of Aristotle and contemporary Aristotle\nscholars would, in their various interpretations, deny the idea of an\nemanating intellect responsible for the existence of the world\nin De Anima 3.5).\n\n\n\nThat Maimonides is influenced by at least some of these ideas about\noverflow and active intellect is certain. Offering an elaboration of\nthe idea of overflow at Guide 2.11 (G 2.11, P 275), Maimonides\ndescribes the cosmogonical activity through which the cosmos\u2014as\nseen first in a series of intellects\u2014is generated. Preparing in\n2.11 to address the world's having been created in time, Maimonides\ntalks of the divine overflow, promising us that \u201cthese views do\nnot contradict anything said by our prophets and the sustainer of our\nLaw\u201d (G 2.11, P 276). On the views in question, there is a\ndivine overflow that brings about a series of cosmic intellects, these\nintellects themselves being related through a process of overflow to\none another and to the realities which follow from them\nrespectively. He begins:\n\n\nthe overflow (al-fay\u1e0d) coming from Him, may He be\nexalted, for the bringing into being of separate intellects overflows\nlikewise from these intellects, so that one of them brings another one\ninto being and this continue up to the active intellect. With the\nlatter, the bringing into being of separate intellects comes to an end\n(G 2.11, P 275; Arabic at Munk 1931, 192).\n\n\n\n\nHere, Maimonides rehearses the idea, seen clearly in his Islamic\npredecessors, that there are a series of intellects which generate one\nanother (i.e. the highest generating the next highest, and so on until\nthe lowest intellect, viz. active intellect). Maimonides then\ngoes on to mirror the idea, also found in al-Farabi and Avicenna, that\neach intellect additionally generates the body of its sphere, and that\nthere is, furthermore, a set of influences which these spheres wield\nover the generation and corruption of terrestrial, corporeal beings on\nearth:\n\n\nMoreover a certain other act of bringing into being overflows from\nevery separate intellect until the spheres come to an end with the\nsphere of the moon. After it there is the body subject to generation\nand corruption, I mean the first matter [al-m\u0101dda\nal-\u016bl\u0101 (Munk 1931, 192), referring to Aristotelian\nprime matter] and what is composed of it. Furthermore, forces from\nevery sphere enter the elements until their overflow is completed with\nthe completion of generation and corruption (G 2.11, P 275).\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, Maimonides at Guide 2.11 wishes to\n\n\nshow that governance overflows from the deity, may He be exalted, to\nthe intellects according to their rank; that from the benefits\nreceived by the intellects, good things and lights overflow to the\nbodies of the spheres; and that from the spheres\u2014because of the\ngreatness of the benefits they have received from their\nprinciples\u2014forces and good things overflow to this body subject\nto generation and corruption (G 2.11, P 275).\n\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Maimonides here mirrors ideas found in earlier Islamic\nauthors. In this regard, consider al-Farabi's own explanation of the\ncosmic overflow:\n\n\nThe First [i.e. God] is that from which everything which exists comes\ninto existence\u2026The genesis of that which comes into existence\nfrom it takes place by way of an emanation (fay\u1e0d) (PS\n88), the existence of which is due to the existence of something else,\nso that the existence of something different from the First emanates\nfrom the First's existence\u2026 (PS 89-91)\n\n\n\n\nGoing on to elaborate the unfolding of the universe from God, the\nfirst intellect, al-Farabi describes the emanation of 10 discrete\nintellects from the First, explaining how the dual intellection of\neach of these intellects (intellection of its own essence on the one\nhand, and intellection of God on the other) in turn results in the\ncoming into being of (a) a heaven or celestial sphere, and (b) the\nintellect below it:\n\n\nFrom the First emanates the existence of the Second. This Second is,\nagain, an utterly incorporeal substance, and is not in matter. It\nthinks of its own essence and thinks the First. What it thinks of its\nown essence is no more than its essence. As a result of its thinking\nof the First, a third existent follows necessarily from it; and as a\nresult of its substantification in its specific essence, the existence\nof the First Heaven follows necessarily. The existence of the Third,\nagain, is not in matter, its substance is intellect, and it thinks its\nown essence and thinks the First. As a result of its substantification\nin its specific essence, the existence of the sphere of the fixed\nstars follows necessarily, and as a result of its thinking of the\nFirst, a fourth existence follows necessarily\u2026 (PS 101-3)\n\n\n\n\nAnd so on until the last intellect arises. This last intellect arising\nin the great cosmic chain of being is the active intellect, described\nby al-Farabi here as the \u201celeventh existence.\u201d For\nal-Farabi, the active intellect is\u2014as in other Arabic\nphilosophical texts\u2014the 10th of the emanated\nintellects; its description as \u201celeventh existence\u201d does\nnot challenge that idea, but simply follows from the fact that Farabi\ncounts God as a first intellect above the other separate intellects,\nthe first emanated intellect after God as the first intellect\n(separate, that is, from God), and so on until the active intellect,\nwhich, as the 10th emanated intellect after God, is the\n\u201celeventh existence,\u201d (see PS II.3.9-10, W 105; PS\nIV.13.2, W 203).\n\n\n\nWith al-Farabi and Avicenna, Maimonides adopts a cosmology of 10\nseparate intellects, with active intellect governing the sublunar\nrealm in which we live. With his Islamic predecessors, Maimonides\nadditionally identifies these separate intellects with the angels\nspoken of in religious tradition. One Islamic philosophical example of\nthis view can be seen in al-Farabi who, in the introductory summary to\nhis treatise on the perfect state, describes the ten separate cosmic\nintellects as \u201cthe existents which should be believed to be the\nangels \u201d (PS 39), and as those \u201cof which it should be said\nthat they are the angels \u201d (PS 41).\n\n\nOn the question of being's source, while Maimonides shares with his\nIslamic predecessors a commitment to God's role as the ultimate cause\nof the world, he additionally seems to share with al-Farabi and\nAvicenna, and in opposition to the views of Averroes, the idea that\nthe active intellect is a dator formarum (a giver of\nforms). On this view, the active intellect actually supplies the world\nin which we live with its forms and as such, plays a crucial causal\nrole in the very formation of existence. In this sense, the active\nintellect is allowed to play a shared role in God's creative,\nsustaining role as source of existence (in whatever way that process\nis ultimately understood).\n\n\nThat Maimonides is influenced by earlier Islamic writings on overflow\nand active intellect is certain. What is uncertain, though, is how all\nthe details of these ideas play out exactly in his own ultimate view\nof creation. Maimonides' own views on the issues related to\ncreation\u2014the necessitation of creation, the role of will, and\nthe possibility of eternality\u2014are, as we have already said,\nsubject to much debate, and for good reason given how many different\nthings he says about these subjects. Given the complexity of\nMaimonides' view of creation one must be careful not to make too many\nassumptions about what exactly is entailed by the Maimonidean\n\u201coverflow\u201d view. Not only can one not take Maimonides'\ntalk of \u201coverflow\u201d as automatically committing him to the\neternal emanation view espoused by Avicenna, but, one can't, it seems,\nbe too sure of what it means at all\u2014even in Avicenna. In this\nspirit, we might cite al-Farabi's own reminder of the vicissitudes of\nlanguage in trying to explain the nature of the world's deepest\nunderpinnings. Al-Farabi warns of taking cosmological spatial\nlanguages of \u201chigher and lower \u201d too literally, and offers\nthe same warning for the language of \u201coverflow\u201d:\n\n\nIndeed by \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower,\u201d he means the\nvenerable and superior, not spatial location\u2026It is the same\nwith what [philosophers say] about the \u201coverflowing\u201d of\nthe intellect to the soul and the \u201coverflowing\u201d of the\nsoul to nature. By that, he means only the benefit the intellect\nprovides by assisting the soul to retain the universal forms when it\napprehends their particulars\u2026By the \u201coverflowing\u201d\nof the soul to nature, he means the benefit it provides by yearning\nfor what is useful for its subsistence\u2026 (HTO sections 71-73; B\n163-4).\n\n\n\nYet one more reason to take care in approaching Maimonides'\u2014or\nanyone else's\u2014emanationist account of cosmic overflow. In fact,\nMaimonides himself mirrors this insight at Guide 2.12 where in the\ncontext of trying to explain some of the different ways the term\n\u201coverflow\u201d can be \n used,[18]\n and trying to explain what sense there is\nin using the term to describe God's activity, he stresses that\n\u201cwe are not capable of finding the true reality of a term that\nwould correspond to the true reality of the notion\u201d (G 2.12, P\n279). In fact, this sensitivity to the temperamental nature of\nlanguage when it comes to transmitting important truths leads us to\nanother key aspect of Maimondean thought, one too which is deeply\ninfluenced by its Islamic context and to which we will turn below (see\n Section 7).\n6. Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy\n\n\nWe have seen the Islamic philosophical context of Maimonides'\ncosmology of separate intellects (the \u201cangels\u201d), with\nactive intellect at the helm of the sublunar world in which we\nlive. For Maimonides\u2014as for his Islamic philosophical\npredecessors and contemporaries\u2014the active intellect is an\nimportant governing principle for the sublunar realm, a cosmic\nintellectual principle which, in addition to whatever other roles it\nplays in the workings of our terrestrial realm, plays a crucial role\nin human knowledge\u2014including prophecy, and in fact serves even\nas the foundation for a theory of immortality.\n\n\nWith Islamic philosophers before him, Maimonides describes the active\nintellect as an overflow from God which overflows onto humans, giving\nthem knowledge and leading them towards perfection. Expositing the\nPsalms 36:10 verse, \u201cFor with Thee is the fountain of life; in\nThy light do we see light,\u201d Maimonides explains that\n\n\nthrough the overflow of the intellect that has overflowed from Thee\n[i.e., God], we intellectually cognize, and consequently we receive\ncorrect guidance, we draw inferences, and we apprehend the intellect.\nUnderstand this. (G 2.12, P 280)\n\n\n\n\nCommenting on this cosmic dynamic at the very start of the Guide,\nMaimonides understands the Genesis 1:26-27 idea that man was created\n\u201cin the image\u201d of God as pointing to the divine link\nbetween God and man found in the human intellect (and its link to\nactive intellect):\n\n\nNow man possesses as his proprium something in him that is very\nstrange as it is not found in anything else that exists under the\nsphere of the moon, namely, intellectual apprehension\n(al-idr\u0101k al-\u2018aql\u012b). In the exercise of this,\nno sense, no part of the body, none of the extremities are used; and\ntherefore this apprehension was likened unto the apprehension of the\ndeity\u2026It was because of this something, I mean because of the\ndivine intellect (al-\u2018aql al-il\u0101h\u012b) conjoined\n(al-mutta\u1e63il) with man, that it is said of the latter\nthat he is in the image of God and in His likeness\u2026 (G\n1.1; P 23; Pines' use of italics indicates Maimonides' use of Hebrew\nin his text; for Arabic, see Munk 1931, 15).\n\n\n\n\nIt is in our intellectual apprehension that we are most like unto\nGod. In fact, described not only as a likeness to God but as\nan overflow from God, the human moment of intellect may be\nseen as the mark of divine presence in man. Bemoaning the absence\namong humans of a pure state of fully actualized intellect, Maimonides\nallegorically exposits the Genesis Biblical account of Adam's\ntransgressions in the Garden of Eden as man's falling away from his\nGod-given intellect\u2014an intellect, described above as a\n\u201cdivine intellect\u201d here described further as an overflow\nfrom God:\n\n\nFor the intellect that God made overflow (af\u0101\u1e0da;\nMunk 1931, 16) unto man and that is the latter's ultimate perfection,\nwas that which Adam had been provided with before\ndisobeyed. It was because of this that it was said of him that he was\ncreated in the image of God and in His likeness\u2026(G\n1.2; P 24; Pines' use of italics indicates Maimonides' use of Hebrew\nin his text).\n\n6.1 Epistemology\n\n\nOn the epistemological/psychological details of active intellect,\nMaimonides appears to follow a Farabian tradition in at least some\nrespects. With Aristotle, al-Farabi describes the goal of human\nexistence as the attainment of happiness.  Al-Farabi goes on to\ndescribe this state of human perfection in at least partly passive\nterms\u2014as something which is \u201cgiven to the possible beings\ncapable of receiving it \u201d (PR, N1 35). In this context, the\n\u201cgiver\u201d emerges as active intellect. Al-Farabi describes\nthe purpose of active intellect as \u201ctrue and supreme happiness\n\u201d (PR, N1 38), and further clarifies that the human being can\nhave this happiness \u201conly when the active intellect first gives\nthe first intelligibles, which constitute the primary\nknowledge\u2026\u201d (PR, N1 35).\n\n\nFor al-Farabi and Avicenna, as for Maimonides, this\n\u201cgiving\u201d activity of active intellect is described in\nparticular as an emanative overflow, and is seen as foundational to\nthe activity of human knowing.  Contrasting human intellection from\nGod's own fully actualized state of intellection (see above),\nal-Farabi follows Aristotle and speaks of the actualization process of\nhuman intellect as requiring an activating cause:\n\n\n\u2026neither the rational faculty nor what is provided in man by\nnature has the wherewithal to become of itself intellect in actuality.\nTo become intellect in actuality it needs something else which\ntransfers it from potentiality to actuality\u2026 (PS IV.13.1, W\n199).\n\n\n\nThe activating cause needed to bring man from a state of potential to\na state of actual knowing is the active intellect (sometimes\ntranslated as \u201cagent\u201d intellect). Rooted in Aristotle's\nown account of soul at De Anima 3.5 (BWA, 591), this idea\nstands as a cornerstone to Islamic\u2014and\nMaimonidean\u2014philosophical theories of epistemology, prophecy,\nand even afterlife and immortality. How to best interpret what\nAristotle is actually trying to say at De Anima 3.5 need not\nconcern us. Looking, rather, for the features of Aristotle's text\nwhich served as a basis for various Islamic philosophical accounts of\nactive intellect, we find Aristotle's description of a\n\u201cseparable \u201d (BWA 592), essentially \u201cactive\u201d\n(BWA 592) intellect \u201cwithout [which] nothing\n thinks,\u201d[19]\n an \u201cimpassible,\u201d and\n\u201cunmixed\u201d state of intellect, furthermore described by\nAristotle not only as \u201cimmortal and eternal\u201d (BWA 592) but\nas the perfected reality of the human mind once it is \u201cset free\nfrom its present conditions \u201d (BWA 592). \n\n\nIn thinking about the Islamic philosophical context to Maimonides\u2019\nepistemology, we can talk broadly of the influence on his thought of\nIslamic Neoplatonized Aristotelian theories of Active Intellect: Human\nknowledge-formation relies on the activity of this lowest of the\nseparate intellects. It is important, though, to keep in mind some\nimportant Islamic philosophical points of difference in considering\nMaimonides\u2019 context: Starting with al-Farabi and Avicenna, both\nenvision Active Intellect as a key reality outside of God and outside\nof the human mind which plays a key role in the human process of\nknowledge-formation. Following Taylor, however (see Taylor 2012), we\nmight note that while Avicenna sees the ideas contained within Active\nIntellect as the source for the human intellect\u2019s own ideas, al-Farabi\nsees the Active Intellect as merely preparing a person\u2019s mind to\nabstract ideas from her sensory encounter with the material\nworld\u2014an idea, as Taylor points out, found too in\nThemistius\u2019 Paraphrase of the De Anima in which he speaks of a\n\u201cseparate agent intellect which contains all the forms [and\nwhich] comes to be in the human agent intellect empowering and guiding\nits action\u201d (Taylor 2012b, Other Internet\nResources). Summarizing this divide between al-Farabi and Avicena in\nanother way, we might note that while al-Farabi upholds a doctrine of\nabstraction by which the human mind receives content from the outside\nworld, Avicenna instead treats the mind as receiving representations\nof the intelligibles from the Active Intellect. Taylor\u2014citing\nBurnyeat 2008\u2014reminds us (Taylor 2012b, Other Internet\nResources) that there is actually no doctrine of abstraction in\nAristotle; that said, we may nonetheless speak of al-Farabi\u2019s more\nAristotelian (because more sensory and world-reliant) approach to\nknowledge as opposed to Avicenna\u2019s more Platonic/Neoplatonic approach\naccording to which humans receive ideas from \u201con high\u201d so\nto speak (in the case of Plato from the realm of forms, in the case of\nPlotinus from the universal intellect, and in the case of Avicenna\nfrom the active intellect). Taylor also emphasizes the\nrepresentationalist aspect of Avicenna\u2019s view: it is not the active\nintellect\u2019s intelligibles that enter into the human mind, but rather\nrepresentations of those intelligibles (Taylor 2012b, Other Internet\nResources).\n\n\nTurning to Averroes\u2019 mature view (as found in his Long Commentary\non De Anima), he advances the idea not only of a shared active\nintellect, but of a shared material intellect, revealing, as Taylor\nargues, elements of al-Farabi and Themistius in his sense of the\nactive intellect\u2019s role in enabling the human intellect to reliably\nabstract from the outside world. In this sense, Averroes rejects the\nAvicennian sense of active intellect emanating ideas into the human\nmind. (Note: Taylor points to the further vestige of Themistius in\nAverroes\u2019 argument that shared human discourse necessitates belief in\na shared intellect.)  Along similar lines, Averroes rejects the\nPlatonic/Neoplatonic description\u2014found in both al-Farabi and\nAvicenna\u2014of active intellect as a repository of ideas. Averroes\ninstead focuses on active intellect as a \u201cform for us\u201d, in\nthe sense, says Taylor, of \u201cintrinsically operating within\nus\u201d (Taylor 2005, 29)\u2014though not in the sense of\nsuggesting that there is either an active intellect or a material\nintellect for each person, and also while maintaining that active and\nmaterial intellect are themselves completely separate intellects. For\nAverroes, there is for all humans one shared separate active intellect\nand one shared separate material intellect, with the activation of\nabstraction taking place in the shared active intellect and the\nreception of the abstracted intelligibles taking place in the shared\nmaterial intellect. In using her soul\u2019s powers correctly the human\nbeing is able to benefit from these processes of abstraction and\nreception, in this way moving from a state of sensation to a state of\nknowledge. Even with the involvement of shared separate active and\nmaterial intellects, Averroes describes the process as intrinsic to\nthe individual human soul and as active intellect becoming \u201cform\nfor us\u201d (itself understood as the human\u2019s final end) in a true\nconjunction or uniting of the individual human soul with the active\nintellect. (In fact, it is precisely this intimate\nrelation/conjunction/unification that Averroes find lacking in\nal-Farabi\u2019s (and we might add, Avicenna\u2019s) view of active intellect as\nsimply emanating data into the human soul; see Taylor 2005, 26-31.) As\nTaylor summarizes this view in Averroes: \u201cWe must use our powers\nof sense, imagination, cogitation and memory to form particular\nrefined intentions, intelligibles in potency, for presentation to the\nagent intellect [i.e. the active intellect] for abstraction, that is,\nfor transference to the higher level of being intelligibles in act,\nand for the attendant impression upon the receptive material\nintellect\u201c (Taylor 2005, 31). (For further insights on Averroes\u2019\nepistemology, see for example: Taylor 1998, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009,\n2011, 2012b (Other Internet Resources); Wolfson 1958; Kogan 1985;\nDavidson 1992; Kaplan 1977; Twetten 1995).\n\n\nIn approaching Maimonides\u2019 own writings, it is important to keep in\nmind competing epistemological views at play in his Islamic\nphilosophical context. In this way we can continue to work to\ndetermine which of al-Farabi, Avicenna, or Averroes is more\ninfluential on his epistemological thinking, and what\u2014if\nany\u2014broader religious and philosophical implications that might\nhave for how we view his work.\n\nWe might here also consider the extent and nature of Maimonides\u2019 view\non the limits of human knowledge (a point about which there is much\nscholarship and much debate); in two classical essays by Altmann and\nPines on this topic, the Islamic influences on Maimonides of\nal-Farabi, ibn Bajja, Avicenna, and Averroes are explored (see Altmann\n1987 and Pines 1979).\n6.2 Illumination\n\n\nRelevant to Islamic\u2014and Maimonidean\u2014ideas about the active\nintellect's role in knowing and prophecy in particular is Aristotle's\nadditional description of this active intellectual principle as\nanalogous to light. Especially for the Neoplatonic Islamic readers of\nDe Anima, this\nreference to light opens an interpretive floodgate, offering a clear\ncrossover from talk of a separable, immortal active intellect (in\nDe Anima 3.5) to overtly illuminationist and emanationist\nNeoplatonic doctrines (in the Theology of Aristotle). For, in\nthe Theology of Aristotle (as in Plotinus' original Greek\nwritings, and as in Neoplatonic texts more generally), one finds\nabundant metaphors of light used to describe the elusive process of\nemanation through which the world exists. Looking to the Neoplatonic\ncosmologies of Al-Farabi and Avicenna, we additionally find metaphors\nof light to describe the unique influence that the active intellect\ncasts over the sublunar world. In the metaphorical idea of a light pouring\ndown from active intellect, there emerges the ontological idea that\nthis intellect emanates forth the very form of the world. There emerges too the epistemological\nidea of illumination\u2014the idea that human knowledge is actualized\nnot by mere encounter with the world, and not merely by some mechanism\ninternal to the individual's mind, but by the active intellect as a\n\u201csource of enlightenment\u201d which pours down on it, as it\nwere. Here seen in its epistemological role, the active intellect\n\u201cilluminates\u201d the human mind, enabling it to become filled with truths (in one or another way; see previous section on differences in this regard between al-Farabi and Avicenna). For Al-Farabi and Avicenna, as for\nMaimonides, this illuminationist tendency (rooted at least in part, we\nmight say, in the De Anima 3.5 notion of light) goes hand in\nhand with a complex Aristotelian account of the workings of the\nindividual human mind in the attainment of knowledge. Their commitment\nto a complex Aristotelian epistemology and psychology, however, is\ntempered with a doctrine of illumination on which the active intellect\nplays a key role in the final attainment of knowledge\u2014including\nprophecy. For Maimonides, as for his Islamic predecessors, active\nintellect is like a light: it is the overflowing illuminating fount of\nhuman intellection and prophecy.\n6.3 Conjunction\n\n\nIn addition to this language of overflow, Maimonides speaks of the\nmoment of perfected human contact with active intellect in terms of a\n\u201cconjunction\u201d (itti\u1e63\u0101l) between the\nhuman intellect and active intellect. The notion and language of\nitti\u1e63\u0101l in particular can be seen in Maimonides when he\nspeaks, for example, of active intellect as the \u201cdivine\nintellect conjoined (al-mutta\u1e63il) with man\u201d (G 1.1, P\n23; for Arabic see Munk 1931, 15). While it might be noted that this\nlanguage of itti\u1e63\u0101l can conceptually be linked to a notion of unification at play in Sufi\ndiscussions of union-with-God (with its Hebrew correlate,\ndev\u0113q\u016bth, occuring frequently in Jewish\nKabbalistic writings), Maimonides' own use of the concept of\nitti\u1e63\u0101l (to describe conjunction with the active\nintellect) is in line with the commonplace technical terminology at\nplay in Arabic textual traditions of [Neoplatonized] Aristotelian\nepistemology.\n6.4 Passionate Love\n\n\nIt might be additionally noted that Maimonides reflects mystical\nIslamic Sufi language once again when, in his description of the\nculminating moment of intellectual perfection, he employs the Arabic\nlanguage of \u201c\u2018ishq\u201d (passionate love, love,\ndesire).[20]\nThis terminology is also expressly used by Maimonides\u2019 Islamic\nphilosophical predecessor Avicenna in his own \u201cRis\u0101lah\nf\u012b\u2019l-\u2018ishq\u201d (\u201cTreatise on\nLove\u201d) where he explores God\u2019s reality as the pure object of\nlove (a point seen already in Aristotle\u2019s idea of God as the final\nobject of all desire), as well as the pure subject of\nlove.[21]\n\nReflecting on the related Hebrew term\n\u1e25\u014dsh\u0113q (one who loves passionately) as it relates\nto his reading of Psalms 91:14, Maimonides explains,\n\n\n\u2026you know the difference between the terms one who\nloves (here Maimonides uses the Hebrew word\n\u201c\u014dh\u0113v\u201d) and one who loves\npassionately (here Maimonides uses the Hebrew word\n\u201c\u1e25\u014dsh\u0113q\u201d); an excess of love, so\nthat no thought remains that is directed toward a thing other than the\nBeloved, is passionate love (\u2018ishq) (G 3.51, P 627).\n\n\n\n\nIt is certainly not evident that Maimonides literally has a mystical\nunion in mind in this passage, even with his use of what might seem to\nbe charged mystical language. The possibility of a mystical meaning\nfor this and surrounding passages at Guide 3.51 remains subject to\ndebate, although the most straightforward account of what Maimonides\nis up to here remains entirely non-mystical: purely in line with an\nIslamic Neoplatonized Aristotelian epistemological tradition of\noverflow/conjunction, Maimonides understands \u201cpassionate\nlove\u201d of God (and related Biblical claims about God's kissing\nthe prophet Moses) as that moment in which the human intellect comes\ninto full alignment with the active intellect, thus reaching the\nheight of human perfection.\n6.5 Prophecy: Overflow, Actualization, Fitness, and the Naturalized Divine\n\n\nThe active intellect is a divine intermediary. Not only is it a cosmic\noverflow whose ultimate source is God Himself, and not only does it\nstands as governor of sublunar existence and key illuminating source\nin all human intellection, but active intellect is additionally\nidentified as the divine intermediary for prophecy. As Maimonides\nnotes,\n\n\nKnow that the true reality and quiddity of prophecy consists in its\nbeing an overflow overflowing from God, may He be cherished and\nhonored, through the intermediation of the active intellect\u2026 (G\n2.36, P 369)\n\n\n\n\nAnd, drawing upon the epistemological ideas found in his Islamic\nphilosophical milieu, he describes this process further in terms of\nactive intellect's causing the human intellect to \u201cpass from\npotentiality to actuality\u201d (G 2.38, P 377). \n\n\nAt the heart of this epistemology is a notion of human receptivity; in\nline with our discussion of al-Farabian vs. Avicennian epistemology\nabove, we might describe this receptivity in one of three ways: (1)\nthe soul\u2019s receiving an overflow of intelligibles from active\nintellect, (2) the soul\u2019s receiving an overflow of representations of\nintelligibles from active intellect, or (3) the soul\u2019s receiving an\noverflow from active intellect which enables it to abstract\nintelligibles from the sensory world). There emerges additionally a\nnotion of human fitness: human happiness is, as al-Farabi says,\n\u201cgiven to the possible beings capable of receiving it\u201d\n(PR, N1 35). For al-Farabi, human beings possess different natural\ndispositions, leaving some of them unable\u2014by their very\nnature\u2014to ever rise to the level of human perfection:\n\n\n\u2026not every man is equipped by natural disposition to receive\nthe first intelligibles, because individual human being are made by\nnature with unequal powers and different preparations\u2026 (PR, N1\n35)\n\n\n\n\nMaimonides here too appears to follow al-Farabi's treatment. Speaking\nof the overflow from active intellect, Maimonides remarks that it is\nthat \u201cthrough which there is a difference of rank between our\nintellects \u201d (G 2.37, P 373), and speaks too of the\n\u201cnatural disposition\u201d of different people's imaginative\nfaculties (G 2.36, P 369), speaking in various ways throughout the\nGuide of the natural aptitudes of humans and how some people are\nsimply not as disposed towards intellectual apprehension as others:\nsome souls are more fit than others.\n\n\nIt is for the most fit of human souls, then, that we can expect the\nhighest level of conjunction with the active\nintellect.[22]\nIt is precisely this corollary to the theory of human intellection\nwhich lies at the heart of the Islamic philosophical\u2014and with\nit, the Maimonidean\u2014understanding of prophecy. Prophecy is a\nnatural phenomenon, stemming precisely from the cosmological structure\nof reality and the epistemological/psychological structure of human\nminds.  The prophet is, in this context, the person whose ability to\nreceive the overflow from active intellect is especially superb. And,\nfollowing on this naturalized tradition of prophecy, there will be\ndifferent levels of prophecy\u2014as well as different levels of\nprovidence\u2014corresponding to different levels of engagement with\nthe overflow from active \nintellect.[23]\n\n\n\nThe active intellect in these traditions is a natural cosmic mechanism\nat play in human knowledge, but also in prophecy (as well as in\nprovidence and immortality). It is in this sense that such\ntraditions\u2014including Maimonides\u2014are often described as\nholding \u201cnaturalized\u201d theories of prophecy. Following this\nnaturalizing tendency further, we might note the fluid back and forth\nbetween natural and supernatural descriptions of the active intellect\nand other cosmic processes: In this context, the angels (the divine\nemissaries, as it were) are identified with the separate intellects,\nand active intellect in particular emerges as the bearer\u2014or\neven, messenger\u2014of prophecy to the human intellect. In this\nspirit, we find in Maimonides and in his Islamic predecessors\ndescriptions of the active intellect in divine terms. For example,\nreturning to the context in which Maimonides explains the Biblical\nnotion (Genesis 1:26-27) of man's being created in the image of God in\nterms of man's possession of an intellectual faculty, we find the\ndescription of the active intellect\u2014whence man's own intellect\nreceives its power\u2014as a \u201cdivine intellect\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026It was because of this something, I mean because of the divine\nintellect (al-\u2018aql al-il\u0101h\u012b) conjoined\n(al-mutta\u1e63il) with man, that it is said of the latter\nthat he is in the image of God and in His likeness\u2026 (G\n1.1, P 23; Pines' use of italics indicates Maimonides' use of Hebrew\nin his text; for Arabic see Munk 1931, 15).\n\n\n\n\nTurning to al-Farabi we readily see the divine descriptions of this\nnatural cosmic principle at play as well:\n\n\n\u2026of the active intellect it ought to be said that it is the\ntrustworthy spirit and the holy spirit; and it is called by names\nresembling these \ntwo\u2026\u201d[24]\n\n\n\nDescribing active intellect in this same sacred way in another text,\nand identifying it further in this regard as the agent of revelation,\nal-Farabi, in the context of describing the virtuous ruler of the\nvirtuous city in the Book of Religion, speaks of\n\n\n\u2026the spiritual being governing the king who is the first ruler\nof the virtuous city, namely the one set down as the trustworthy\nspirit, and this is the one through which God, may He be exalted,\ncommunicates the revelation to the first ruler of the city\u2026(BR,\nB 111, section 26).\n\n\n\nFollowing on the general association (described above) of the cosmic\nseparate intellects with angels (with the active intellect emerging in\nparticular as the angel Gabriel), here and above, al-Farabi correlates\nthe active intellect to the Trustworthy Spirit of Quran XXVI, 193,\nidentifying the active intellect as the agent of prophetic\nrevelation.\n\n\nIt is in this spirit that we can approach Maimonides' own account of\nactive intellect as a divine overflow responsible for prophecy.\nFollowing al-Farabi's idea above, Maimonides speaks of the perfected\nhuman being as having his intellect in most full contact with the\nactive intellect, speaking in terms of \u201cthe intellect that God\nmade overflow (af\u0101\u1e0da) unto man\u201d (G 1.2, P\n24; Munk 1931, 16). And with al-Farabi, Maimonides too identifies this\nmost perfected human intellectual state as the state of\nprophecy. Speaking of prophecy as active intellect's mediation of\ndivine overflow onto man, Maimonides adds,\n\n\n\u2026This is the highest degree of man and the ultimate term of\nperfection that can exist for his species\u2026 (G 2.36, P 369)\n\n\n\nWhile the mechanics of active intellect point to a naturalizing\ntendency in Maimonides' philosophical treatment of prophecy, we must\nnot lose sight of what at least prima facie appears in 2.32\nto be a more robust role for God in this story. \u201cThe opinions of\npeople concerning prophecy are like their opinion concerning the\neternity of the world or its creation in time\u2026\u201d (G 2.32,\nP 361) After addressing two other views of prophecy (one of which is\ndescribed as the completely naturalized view held by the\nphilosophers), Maimonides goes on to recount the \u201copinion of our\nLaw,\u201d which he contrasts from the completely naturalized view as\nfollows:\n\n\n[This third opinion, viz., \u201cthe opinion of our\nLaw\u201d] is identical with the philosophic opinion except in one\nthing. For we believe that it may happen that one who is fit for\nprophecy and prepared for it should not become a prophet, namely, on\naccount of the divine will. To my mind this is like all the miracles\nand takes the same course as they\u2026 (G 2.32, P 361)\n\n\n\n\nThis view is sometimes described as a \u201cdivine veto\u201d view:\nwhile with the philosophers Maimonides understands prophecy as a\nnatural human encounter with active intellect, he here adds the idea\nthat God has the power to prevent\u2014or\n\u201cveto\u201d\u2014this natural phenomenon from leading to\nprophecy if He were to so desire. It is not at all clear, however, how\nwe ought take this caveat. Together with his view on creation,\nMaimonides' view on the exact mechanics of prophecy\u2014and the\nsupra-natural role, if any, of God in that mechanics\u2014is open to\nscholarly debate.  It is in part difficult to know for certain what\nMaimonides has in mind here since, as above in the case of creation,\nthere are arguably different ways\u2014some more naturalized than\nothers\u2014that one might understand Maimonides' notion of\n\u201cdivine Will,\u201d and hence, arguably different ways that one\nmight understand the import of the above claim from 2.32. There are,\nhence, arguably different ways that one might understand the exact\nmechanics of Maimonidean prophecy and the role that God plays in that\nmechanics at 2.32 and in the Guide more broadly.\n\n\nWe might also note that to the extent that one sees in Maimonides a\nsense that the prophet is able to arrive at truths intuitively and\ndirectly without the ordinary processes of reasoning (as one seems to\nfind in Guide 2.38), one might detect the influence of Avicenna (See\nPines 1969, ci-ciii). (For more on prophecy in this context, see for\nexample: Taylor 2012c, Other Internet Resources; Kreisel 2001; Walzer\n1957; Altmann 1978; Davidson 1979; W.Z. Harvey 1981.)\n6.6 Providence\n\n\nOn the importance of the active intellect not only for a Maimonidean\ntheory of epistemology and psychology, but theology and ethics as\nwell, we might note that for Maimonides, as for his Islamic\npredecessors and contemporaries, the active intellect, in its intimate\nrelationship with human intellects, lies also the heart of a theory of\nprovidence:\n\n\n\u2026providence watches over everyone endowed with intellect\nproportionately to the measure of his intellect\u2026The providence\nof God, may He be exalted, is constantly watching over those who have\nobtained this overflow\u2026For the thing that necessarily brings\nabout providence and deliverance from the sea of chance consists in\nthat intellectual overflow\u2026 (G 3.51, 624-5)\n\n\n\n\nWhile not here mentioned explicitly, it is indeed the active intellect\nthat, in the context of Maimonides' Neoplatonized Aristotelian\ncontext, is the cosmic source of the \u201cintellectual\noverflow\u201d under discussion in this passage. As such, the active\nintellect emerges as the cosmic underpinning for Maimonides' mechanics\nof providence: The more in touch a person's intellect is with the\nactive intellect, the more we may say of her that she is \u201cliving\nprovidentially.\u201d As Maimonides notes, \u201cprovidence watches\nover everyone endowed with intellect proportionately to the measure of\nhis intellect\u2026\u201d (G 3.51, 624). Taken in the context of\nMaimonides' theory of active intellect as that cosmic intermediary\nresponsible for human intellectual actualization, the above claim\nsuggests that \u201cdivine providence\u201d is found in one's\nability to conjoin to the active intellect. This, of course, is a\ndecidedly naturalized understanding of providence: far from a hand of\nGod intervening in the lives of men, divine providence here emerges as\nthe properly directed life that one who conjoins with active\nintellect\u2014and who, as such, attains the heights of knowledge\navailable to the human mind\u2014will be more readily able to\nlive.\n\n\nStressing further the theological and ethical import of the active\nintellect, we find him, at the very end of his treatise, speaking of\nthis overflow in urgent tones:\n\n\nA call to attention. We have already made it clear to you that that\nintellect which overflowed from Him, may He be exalted, toward us is\nthe bond between us and Him. You have the choice: if you wish to\nstrengthen and to fortify this bond, you can do so; if, however, you\nwish gradually to make it weaker and feebler until you cut it, you can\nalso do that. You can only strengthen this bond by employing it in\nloving Him and in progressing toward this\u2026And it is made weaker\nand feebler if you busy your thought with what is other than\nHe\u2026 (G 3.51, P 621)\n\n\n\n\nPlacing Maimonides in his Islamic philosophical context, we can say\nthat Maimonides is here\u2014in his reference to \u201cthat\nintellect which overflowed from Him\u201d\u2014adverting to the\ndoctrine of active intellect as key to human knowledge:\n\n\nIt is fitting that your attention be roused to the nature of that\nwhich exists in the divine overflow coming toward us, through which we\nhave intellectual cognition\u2026 (G 2.37, P 373)\n\n\n\n\nWe might here also note the strong affinity between Maimonides\u2019 and\nAverroes\u2019 naturalized views of providence. As we saw above (see\nsection 3 on God), for Averroes God is the final cause who moves the\nseparate intellects which in turn move the heavens which in turn gives\nrise to the natural heat which, by actualizing forms, activates the\nentire motion and reality of nature. It is precisely this set of ideas\nthat lies at the heart of Averroes\u2019 conception of divine providence\n(\u2018in\u0101ya All\u0101h) as the well-ordered functioning\nof species (and of individuals under their species) as a result of\nGod\u2019s functioning as the final cause in this way. While there are\ndifferent ways to read Maimonides\u2019 final view on providence, this\nAverroean view ought be treated as a serious possibility. (See\nAverroes' CAM 1715, G 200-201; see Taylor 2012a, 9, Other Internet\nResources) \n6.7 Immortality\n\n\nIn their idea of the active intellect, the Islamic philosophical\ntradition\u2014and Maimonides in its wake\u2014finds not only the\ngrounding mechanism for human knowledge and prophecy, but for\nimmortality as well. In the context of Aristotle's De Anima\n3.5 remarks about an eternal cosmic principle which is the perfected\nreality of the human intellect set free from its body, various\ntraditions of Islamic philosophy explain immortality in terms of a\nperson's truest nature (viz. his intellect) living on\neternally in (or, as) the reality of active intellect. Keeping in mind\nthat there are important differences which arise on questions of\nindividual, or personal, immortality between various Islamic thinkers\n(Avicenna upholds a sense of individualization after death in contrast\nto Averroes; see e.g. Pines 1963, cii-ciii; Stroumsa 2009, 181), and\nleaving debates over Maimonides' own exact position on this question\naside (Pines and Stroumsa identify Maimonides\u2019 position as agreeing\nwith Averroes on this matter; see Pines 1963, cii; Stroumsa 2009,\n181), we can summarily say that Maimonides follows in the spirit of\nunderstanding the afterlife in terms of the human intellect's\nrelationship\u2014individual or otherwise\u2014to the active\nintellect. In effect, the afterlife is here understood as the human\nintellect's ultimate return to and joining with the cosmic active\nintellect, a set of ideas pulled directly from his Islamic\nphilosophical context. \n7. Imagination, Politics, Allegory\n7.1 Guidance\n\n\nIn his sensitivity to the importance of politics, Maimonides follows\nin the footsteps of other Islamic philosophers, noting, with Aristotle\nthat man is a political animal by nature (see G 3.27, P\n511). Maimonides understands that since average people cannot conjoin\nwith (and hence cannot receive truths from) active intellect\nthemselves, they need help\u2014in the form of virtuous\nguidance\u2014to help them live in accordance with the truth. And it\nis toward this end that Maimonides understands the importance of the\nprophet. The prophet must not only be able to receive truths from\nactive intellect, but must be able to guide people to living in\naccordance with those truths.\n\n\nIt is in this spirit that, following his Islamic predecessors,\nMaimonides describes the prophet as having both a perfected intellect\n(for knowing) and a perfected imagination (for guiding, teaching, and\nleading). For Maimonides, even the paradigmatic prophet Moses\u2014a\nman whose prophecy is understood by Maimonides as a direct engagement\nbetween mind and active intellect without the intermediation of\nimagination[25]\n\u2014must be understood as having a perfected imagination. Along\nthese lines, Maimonides, draws a distinction between the philosopher\nas having a perfected intellect, and the prophet as having perfected\nintellect plus perfected imagination:\n\n\n\u2026the case in which the intellectual overflow overflows only\ntoward the rational faculty and does not overflow at all toward the\nimaginative faculty\u2026is the characteristic of the class of men\nof science engaged in speculation. If, on the other hand, this\noverflow reaches both faculties\u2014I mean both the rational and the\nimaginative\u2014\u2026and if the imaginative faculty is in a state\nof ultimate perfection owing to its natural disposition, this is\ncharacteristic of the class of prophets\u2026 (G 2.37, P 374)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is important about this distinction for Maimonides emerges from\nthe following description of two different kinds of perfect\nindividuals, the second kind being perfect not only in his own right,\nbut being further able to help others perfect themselves:\n\n\nFor sometimes something comes from it [viz. active intellect]\nto a certain individual, the measure of that something being such that\nit renders him perfect, but has no other effect. Sometimes, on the\nother hand, the measure of what comes to the individual overflows from\nrendering him perfect toward rendering others perfect\u2026 (G 2.37,\nP 373-4).\n\n\n\n\nFor Maimonides, both the philosopher and the prophet receive the truth\nin their intellects through conjunction with the active intellect,\nbut, only the prophet is able to use those truths to help other people\n(viz. the masses\u2014those who cannot on their own receive\ntruths from active intellect) live in accordance with truth.  This\nfurther ability on the part of the prophet is precisely tied to his\nhaving a strong imaginative faculty. Following upon a decidedly\nPlatonic political sensibility, Maimonides, in line with his Islamic\nphilosophical predecessors and contemporaries, thinks that a leader\ncan't help average people live good lives (i.e. live lives in\naccordance with truth) by merely spewing intellectual truths at them.\nRather, the only way to help average people live good lives is to\ncouch those truths in terms which they can understand and which can,\nfurthermore, actually move them to appropriate action. On this\npicture, rhetoric and persuasion become key.\n\n\nThe importance of speaking in different ways to different people is a\ncornerstone not only of Maimonides but of Islamic political philosophy\nmore broadly. In fact, in these contexts, religion is itself\nunderstood as the rhetorically persuasive means, par excellence, for\ndirecting the average person towards appropriate living. Starting with\nal-Farabi, we find a distinction drawn between the ideas of philosophy\nand those of religion: while the former are ideas known through\nintellect and arrived at via demonstration, the latter are ideas known\nonly through imaginings of likenesses, and arrived at through\npersuasion (AH 77). Drawing on a Platonic distinction between\ntruths-as-they-are (as known to the intellect) on the one hand, and\nthe mere likenesses (or, pale reflections) of those truths on the\nother, al-Farabi explains the relationship between philosophy and\nreligion as follows:\n\n\n\u2026according to the ancients, religion is an imitation of\nphilosophy\u2026In everything of which philosophy gives an account\nbased on intellectual perception or conception, religion gives an\naccount based on imagination. In everything demonstrated by\nphilosophy, religion employs persuasion\u2026 (AH 77)\n\n\n\n\nIn his Book of Religion, al-Farabi explains along these same\nlines that most people are not able to grasp truths through an\nexercise of intellect, but rather, \u201ceither due to nature or\nbecause they are occupied with other things\u201d these people (the\naverage folks) will \u201cunderstand generally accepted or persuasive\nthings\u201d (BR, B 98; BR, M \u00a7 48). In this context, rhetoric\nbecomes an important tool, helping the virtuous leader in his attempts\nto found a virtuous city by ably engaging average people's\nimaginations (and affecting them in a way that philosophical argument\ncould never affect them), and in this way guiding them along towards\nright action and the happiness that comes from human flourishing. (It\nis a matter for debate whether the average person even has a chance at\na further kind of happiness, viz. the kind of true philosophical\nhappiness that comes from intellectual apprehension.) . In The\nAttainment of Happiness, al-Farabi speaks in this regard of the\nlegislator's representing truths to \u201cthe multitude\u201d (the\naverage people whom he also calls \u201cthe vulgar\u201d in contrast\nto \u201cthe elite\u201d\u2014a distinction employed by Maimonides\nas well), providing guidance to them through images and persuasive\nspeech acts, all of which \u201ctake hold of their souls and dominate\nthem so that they are unable to resolve to do anything else\u201d (AH\n79). He describes this same sort of visceral overtaking in his\ncommentary on Plato's Laws where, speaking to the importance\nof a leader's capturing the hearts of the people and leading them\ntowards virtue, al-Farabi takes note of Plato's own philosophical\nfocus on dancing and flute-playing. As al-Farabi sees it, the art of\nsinging is \u201ctruly very useful, especially because its working\npenetrates the soul; and since the law concerns itself with the soul,\nhe [i.e.  Plato] spoke at length about this subject\u201d (PL\n94).  \n\n\nThere too, al-Farabi illumines the rhetorical task of the virtuous\nruler with an insightful lesson to be drawn from Plato's analogy of\nthe \u201cgentle physician\u201d:\n\n\nThe Lawgiver ought to address every group of men with what is closer\nto their comprehension and intellects, and to set them aright with\nwhat they are capable of doing. For sometimes it is difficult for men\nto comprehend a thing, or they are incapable of doing it; its\ndifficulty causes them to reject it and prompts them to neglect and\ndiscard it.  [Plato] gave as an example of this the skilled and gentle\nphysician who offers the sick man the drugs that are useful to him in\nhis familiar and appetizing food (PL 92).\n\n\n\n\nIn spite of differences from al-Farabi's political teachings, Averroes\nmirrors his predecessor, stressing the importance of rhetoric and its\nimpact on the imagination of the average person. In his Decisive\nTreatise, commenting on the person who is not \u201cadept in\ndemonstration,\u201d Averroes points out the sense in which \u201cit\nis difficult [for that person] to come to assent to an existing thing\nthat is not linked with something imaginable\u201d (DT, B 20). In his\nCommentary on Plato's Republic (preserved in a Hebrew\ntranslation from the Arabic by Samuel ben Judah in the early\n14th century), Averroes notes too that,\n\n\nNo bringer of a nomos is to be found who does not make use of\ninvented stories, for this is something necessary for the multitude to\nreach their happiness\u2026 (CPR 24)\n\n\n\n\nAnd commenting on why Aristotle took an interest in the art of\npoetics\u2014here, in much the same spirit as al-Farabi's above\ncomments on why Plato took an interest in music, and flute\nplaying\u2014Averroes notes that,\n\n\nAristotle came to the opinion that this art [viz., the art of\npoetics] was highly useful, because by means of it the soul of the\nmultitude could be moved to believe in or not believe in a certain\nthing and towards doing or abandoning a certain thing. For that\nreason, he enumerated the matters which enable a man to devise an\nimaginative representation for any particular thing he wishes and to\ndo so in the most complete manner possible for that thing\u2026 (CAP\n84)\n\n\n\n\nIn like manner, Averroes describes Aristotle's interest in rhetoric as\nan interest in \u201cthe means by which man is able to effect\npersuasion about each and every one of the particular matters and to\ndo so in the most complete and most artful manner possible with regard\nto each thing\u201d (CAR 78). Of course, all of this is of interest\nto Averroes himself in that, like al-Farabi, he is sensitive to the\nfact that different people need to be guided in different ways, and\nthat it is the job of religion in particular to help lead \u201cthe\nrhetorical people, who are the overwhelming multitude\u201d (DT, B\n26).\n\n\nLeaving a detailed consideration of differences between al-Farabi and\nAverroes aside, it is clear that Maimonides' own work falls within the\nbroad trajectory of these Islamic political philosophies, and it is in\ntheir spirit that we must work towards understanding his own thoughts\non the relation between philosophy and religion. Maimonides' own ideas\nabout the prophet\u2014as lawgiver\u2014are certainly developed\nagainst the backdrop of Farabian political theory. For Maimonides the\nprophet/lawgiver is not only, as philosopher, possessed of a perfected\nintellect, but he is also a gifted rhetorician, and (as such) teacher,\nleader, and religious guide; he is able to take the philosophical\ntruths he knows so well, and, by imaginatively devising an effective\nsystem of concepts, images, rituals, and stories, actually enable\nthese truths to work in the lives of ordinary people. As we have seen\nin al-Farabi's account of religion above, these persuasive words are\nimpressed upon the imagination of listeners, as they are themselves\ncrafted in the imagination of the lawgiver. In this context, the\nimaginatively devised system of concepts, images, rituals, and stories\nis religion, and the prophet, as Lawgiver, is the giver of religion:\nhe (the one with direct access to the truths found in active\nintellect) gives people a context in which they can actually live in\naccordance with truth, even while they themselves do not have access\nto truth directly (epistemologically failing, as they do, to conjoin\ntheir intellects to the active intellect; see discussion of active\nintellect in section 6).\n\n\nIn like manner, we might point to Maimonides\u2019 own appreciation for the\npower of music\u2014a point mentioned in connection with al-Farabi\nabove, and found too in the writings of\nal-Ghazali.[26]\nContrary to some who describe Maimonides as being opposed to music\n(see e.g. Idelsohn 1929, 126; Stroumsa, 52, n. 1), others emphasize\nMaimonides\u2019 appreciating the importance of music for the soul,\nsomething that Bland calls the \u201cutilitarian hedonism\u201d of\nmusic according to which it can bring a soul to a better-ordered\nstate\u2014either a contemplation-ready state that can lead to\nphilosophy, or simply an emotionally rested state that can lead to\nincreased human wellness. (See Bland 1993, 2000; see too Farmer\n1933)\n\n\nIn considering Maimonides on politics and prophecy, one might also\nconsider Leo Strauss\u2019 emphasis on the significance of the divide\nbetween revelation and reason in Maimonides, and his connection of\nMaimonides along these lines to an ancient tradition that he sees as\nexemplified in Plato\u2019s Laws and as continued in Islamic philosophical\ntradition in such thinkers as al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. There\nis scholarly debate about how to read Strauss, how to understand\nStrauss\u2019 final sense of revelation\u2019s status vis-\u00e0-vis reason, and, as\nsuch, how to understand Strauss\u2019 final understanding of Maimonides\u2019\nown brand of rationalism (all of which is made more difficult by\ndebates over whether\u2014and if so, where and to what extent and to\nwhat end\u2014Strauss himself utilizes the esoteric writing\nstrategies that he attributes to Maimonides and to his Islamic\npredecessors). The details and debates aside, we might simply note\nthat Strauss strongly places Maimonides into a Platonist-into-Islamic\ntradition of political philosophy with implications for the way\nMaimonides understands prophecy, religion, law, and the relationship\nbetween revelation and \nreason.[27] \n7.2 Allegory and Obscure Writing: External Layers vs. True Ideas\n\n\nIt is precisely in the context of the above insights that the idea of\ninterpreting texts in terms of an external and internal\nlayer\u2014including, as we will see, allegorical interpretation of\nthe Bible\u2014becomes so important for Maimonides. For Maimonides,\nallegory \u2014 which couches difficult truths in colorful, vibrant\nimages\u2014and other forms of obscure writing emerge as especially\neffective tools for leading average people to live in accordance with\nthe truths they cannot understand on their own (in this way allowing\nthem the opportunity to live a good life) while shielding them from\nscientific and philosophical truths which would be so hard for them to\nunderstand as to (a) be unable to effect any positive outcomes in\ntheir lives, and/or (b) confuse them to the point of apostasy (an\noutcome which, for Maimonides, precisely blocks the opportunity to\nlive a good life). In this context, Maimonides sees the Bible itself\nas filled with allegorical renderings \u2014 renderings masterfully\ncrafted by Moses, the prophet par excellence. Here, the Bible is a\nliterary masterpiece penned by Moses under the inspiration of the\nactive intellect, but through his own imaginative lens: the Bible is\nin this sense the truth couched in imaginative and rhetorically\npersuasive images (such as anthropomorphic descriptions of God as\nsitting, standing, etc.).  Again (see 7.1), it is\nprecisely the Bible's construction (by Moses the prophet) through\nimaginative and rhetorically effective images and stories that enables\nit to operate upon the hearts (or, more technically, the imaginations)\nof average people, enabling them to live lives in accordance with the\ntruths that they themselves cannot grasp. For his Islamic predecessors\nit is, of course, Muhammad who plays this operative role as the\nvirtuous lawgiving prophet able to lead a community to virtue through\nthe creative imagery and persuasions of religion through the\nimaginative and rhetorically persuasive imageries of the Quran.\n\n\nAs we will discuss more below, in such a context, allegorical\ninterpretation emerges as the key method of properly interpreting the\nBible (or, in the Islamic case, the Quran). For, if the prophet pens\nthe Scripture in a way designed to couch the philosophical truth in\nimaginative images (e.g., anthropomorphic depictions of God), then the\ntrue interpretation of that Scripture must aim at uncovering the\nphilosophical truth behind the surface images.  \n\n\nMaimonides' own sensitivity to the effectiveness and necessity of\ncouching ideas in imaginative images \u2014 and, as such, the\nefficacy of giving voice to truth always indirectly \u2014 can help\nus understand (and, can afford philosophical significance to) what\nseems to be Maimonides' own indirect (and sometimes, as we have seen\nin the case of creation, downright confusing) manner of expressing\nhimself in the Guide. Relatedly, Maimonides' sensitivity to the\neffectiveness of indirectly expressing truths can help us see\nphilosophical significance in his own use of metaphors and parables,\nas well as his allegorical interpretations of the Bible throughout the\nGuide. In fact, Maimonides himself expresses the importance of\nallegory through his own allegorical rendering of the Proverbs 25:11\nidea that \u201cA word fitly spoken is like golden apples in silver\nfiligree casings\u201d (\u201ctap\u016b\u1e25\u0113y zahav\nbi-mask\u012byy\u014dt kesef, davar dav\u016br al afnav\u201d)\n(G Intro, P 11). Here, following in the spirit of al-Farabi's Platonic\n\u201cgentle physician\u201d (see above) who \u201coffers the sick\nman the drugs that are useful to him in his familiar and appetizing\nfood \u201d (PL 92), Maimonides is sensitive to the importance of\nhiding truth (gold) in more familiar (silver) garb\u2014garb which,\nalso following al-Farabi above\u2014must be attractive and fanciful\n(silver filigree) so as to impress itself upon the imagination of the\naverage person. The truths which Maimonides seeks to reveal with this\nimage are manifold: sometimes, in order to do service to the golden\ntruth, one must craft delicate silver casings (viz.,\nallegories, parables, stories, metaphors, and other effective uses of\nlanguage); these \u2018casings\u2019 are filigreed\u2014incredibly\ndifficult to make, as well as extremely beautiful and tempting to look\nat; these casings cover the golden core reality (which is to say,\nallegories hide the truth in itself), and yet, they allow onlookers to\ncatch a glimpse\u2014through the filigree's apertures\u2014of the\nvery golden core which they cover; and, finally, in at once hiding and\nrevealing the true center, these filigree casings of silver are not\nthemselves gold: where gold stands for truth, we may say that these\nfiligree casings of silver are not themselves truth. Where the casings\nare the allegories, parables, and other methods employed by the\nLawgiver (in the Bible and in other forms of religious guidance), the\nimplication is that that many of the ideas of the Bible and of\nreligion more generally (as, for example, anthropomorphic descriptions\nof God as sitting, standing, talking, willing, etc.) are not actually\ntrue. They are, rather, delicate craftings (even: works of art)\ndesigned to captivate the interests of average people and, in this\nway, lead them to living in accordance with the truth.\n\n\nAs these lessons apply to the Biblical imagery used to describe God,\nwe meet back up with our earlier ideas of apophasis (negative\ntheology) in Maimonides: Maimonides, with Islamic philosophers before\nhim, denies that God has attributes, and, as such, reads those\npassages of the Bible which describe God in human terms as allegorical\nin nature. In this regard, Maimonides seizes upon the rabbinic dictum\nthat the Torah speaks in the language of\nhumans.[28]\nBeholden to the idea of using \u201cwords fitly spoken,\u201d\nMaimonides sees the Bible as filled with allegorical constructions,\nconstructions which admit of both an external and an internal sense:\nthe external sense of the text are the \u201cwords fitly\nspoken\u201d (the \u201csilver filigree casings\u201d aimed at the\nmasses), while the internal sense\u2014the golden apple\u2014is the\nphilosophical truth reserved for the elite.\n\n\nFollowing on this general sensitivity to various layers of textual\nmeaning, Maimonides shares his penchant for allegorical reading\ntogether with many Islamic philosophical exegetes, including\nAl-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, and in this way is part of a larger\ntradition of textual interpretation (ta\u2018w\u012bl) in\nwhich Scriptures are seen as having \u201couter\u201d\n(\u1e93\u00e2hir) as well as \u201cinner\u201d\n(b\u0101\u1e6din)\n senses.[29]\n\n\nOn the importance of keeping philosophical interpretations (i.e. true\ninsights alluded to by the text) away from average people, consider\nAverroes. Reflecting in particular on texts dealing with the\nafterlife, he notes:\n\nFor anyone not adept in science, it is obligatory to take them [the\ndescriptions of the next life] in their apparent\n[\u1e93\u0101hir] sense; for him it is unbelief to interpret\nthem because it leads to unbelief. That is why we are of the opinion\nthat, for anyone among the people whose duty it is to have faith in\nthe apparent [\u1e93\u0101hir] sense, interpretation is\nunbelief because it leads to unbelief. Anyone adept in interpretation\nwho divulges that to him calls him to unbelief; and the one who calls\nto unbelief is an unbeliever [k\u0101fir]. [DT 34, B 21]\n\nWhile Averroes himself sees the surface meaning as separate from\ntruth-yielding philosophical interpretations of the scriptural text,\nhe criticizes allegorical interpretation as an allowable mode of\nscriptural interpretation for the average person as it will lead them\nto confusion and possible apostasy.\n\n \nWe might here note Kraemer\u2019s reminder too about the broader context of\nobscure writing in this milieu:\n\nAlexandrian introductions to Aristotle, which were known in the\nIslamic environment, elucidated that the aim of Aristotle\u2019s obscurity\nwas to exclude the unworthy, like curtains in temples (Kraemer 2010,\n50).\n\n\n\nTurning to an example of allegorical rendering of Scriptures in\nMaimonides' Islamic philosophical context, consider al-Farabi's\nidentification of the Trustworthy Spirit of Quran XXVI, 193 with the\nactive intellect. And, stressing the allegorical nature of the Quran,\nAvicenna describes the prophet's proper mode of communication, stating\nthat \u201ca condition the prophet must adhere to is that his words\nshould be symbols and his expression hints\u201d (PP 116). Along\nsimilar lines, speaking in general to a hermeneutics of scriptural\ninterpretation, Averroes points out that since the Quran does not\nconflict with reason, any apparently unreasonable (or, philosophically\nuntenable) Quranic verses must be read allegorically so as to be\nbrought into accordance with reason. In this spirit of allegorical\nhermeneutics, Maimonides includes \u201clexicographical\nchapters\u201d throughout his Guide in which he explains the various\nequivocal meanings of Biblical terms; this strategy can be seen in\nmany Islamic contexts, as, for example in Avicenna's f\u012b\nithb\u0101t al-nubuww\u0101t, where \u201clight\u201d is\ndefined as an equivocal term partaking of an essential as well as a\nmetaphorical meaning (PP 116).  \n\n\nIn addition to sharing the sensibility that Scripture admits of\nequivocal terms and \u201cinner meanings\u201d, Maimonides and his\nIslamic predecessors and contemporaries often draw their attention to\nvery similar sorts of scriptural claims, most notably, those\nscriptural claims (in the Bible for Maimonides, and in the Quran for\nthe Muslim thinkers) which suggest divine corporeality on their\nsurface. One example can be found in a comparison of Maimonides' and\nAverroes' respective allegorical analyses of the idea\u2014found in\nvarious guises in both the Bible and the Quran\u2014that God rests in\na place. For both thinkers, it is simply false to say of God that He\nis found in space in some place. And so, Maimonides renders this idea\nof God-in-place allegorical in his treatment of a number of Biblical\nterms, including the terms \u201cplace\u201d (maq\u014dm)\n(Guide 1.8), \u201cthrone\u201d (G 1.9), \u201cindwelling\u201d (G\n1.10; G 1.25), and \u201cto sit\u201d (G 1.11). In like manner, we\nfind Averroes' commenting too on texts suggesting that God has a place\n(or, relatedly, that He has a body)\u2014including the Quranic\ndescription of \u201cGod's directing Himself [2:29] and the Tradition\nabout His \n descent\u201d[30]\u2014as \n texts which have a surface\nmeaning which \u201cis obligatory for those adept in\ndemonstration\u201d to interpret allegorically (DT, B 19).\n\n\nIt might be noted that while Maimonides seems to see Biblical allegory\nas speaking (like any well-crafted allegory or parable) in ways most\nfit for helping its average readers, there is an odd way in which he\nalso seems to fault the Bible's frequent allegories (e.g., its talk of\nGod in corporeal terms) for providing folks with ideas about God which\nare false, and which stand, it would seem, as obstacles to their\nattainment of knowledge. Observing that \u201cman has in his nature a\nlove of, and an inclination for, that to which he is habituated\u201d\n(G 1.31, P 67), and that \u201cman has love for, and the wish to\ndefend, opinions to which he is habituated and in which he has been\nbrought up and has a feeling of repulsion for opinions other than\nthose,\u201d Maimonides notes:\n\n\nFor this reason also man is blind to the apprehension of the true\nrealities and inclines toward the things to which he is habituated.\nThis happened to the multitude with regard to the belief in His\ncorporeality and many other metaphysical subjects as we shall make\nclear. All this is due to people being habituated to, and brought up\non, texts that it is an established usage to think highly of and to\nregard as true and whose external meaning is indicative of the\ncorporeality of God and of other imaginings with no truth in them, for\nthese have been set forth as parables and riddles\u2026 (G 1.31, P\n67)\n\n\n\n\nAlong these very same lines, Maimonides wonders why some religious\npractitioners believe God to have attributes, to be corporeal and to\nbe essentially change-able in any way. To this he answers,\n\n\nFor he who believes in this doctrine was not led to it by intellectual\nspeculation; he merely followed the external sense\n(zaw\u0101hir literally \u201cexternal senses\u201d) of the\ntexts of the Scriptures (G 1.53, P 119; Munk 1931, 81).\n\n\n\n\nIt seems fair to say, in light of such passages in the Guide as the\ntwo above, that the allegorical artistry of the Bible, in its intended\neffect\u2014of leading average people to be able to live in\naccordance with the truth\u2014comes with some unpleasant side\neffects, viz. it might indeed leave some people with patently\nfalse ideas about God and reality. In a system where having knowledge\nof the truth is paramount\u2014and is even the precondition for\nprovidence (as we have seen above)\u2014the fact that the Bible's\n\u201csurface\u201d (or: \u201cexternal\u201d) sense leads some to\nembrace false beliefs is a pretty serious problem, suggesting, it\nwould seem, that the average person who needs to be led by the\nexternal sense of Biblical parables will never be able to attain the\ntrue human perfection. Here, it seems that the persuasive rhetoric of\nScripture's external sense fills the imagination with images vibrant\nenough to lead even the average person to live in accordance with\ntruth, but will, as such, stand always as a veil preventing that\nperson from ever attaining the truth per se.\n\n\nHaving explored the Islamic background, we might additionally note\nthat Maimonides himself associates the tradition of allegorical\ninterpretation of Biblical texts with Rabbinic writing strategies; as\nsuch, we may say that Maimonides sees a kinship between philosophical\nallegorization and a Biblical and Rabbinic Jewish hermeneutic at the\nheart of Judaism. \n\n\nIt is important to note in all of this that Maimonides emphasizes the\nimportance of sharing with even average people the truth of God\u2019s\nabsolute unity and (relatedly) the truth of God\u2019s incorporeality. This\nmeans, of course, that in spite of his emphasis on the need to shield\nthe golden apple of truth from the masses much of the time, Maimonides\nadvocates overtly teaching every person that the anthropomorphic\nimages in the Bible are literally false. In other words, in spite of\nMaimonides\u2019 emphasis on (a) the importance of addressing the average\nperson by way of imagination (not intellect), (b) the role of the\nBible\u2019s external layer (the \u201csilver filgree\u201d) as precisely\naimed at the imagination, and (c) the repeated appearance in the\nBible\u2019s external layer of imaginative anthropomorphic images,\nMaimonides nonetheless thinks it is important to tell people that God\nhas no body.\n\n\nWe might highlight a difference in this regard with Averroes for whom\nit is never a good idea to share any such truths with the masses (see\nPines 1969, cxviii-cxix; Stroumsa 2009, 74-76). This can be seen as\nsignaling a larger philosophical-hermeneutical divide between the two\nthinkers: Whereas both understand the difference between religion and\nphilosophy, and while both understand the role of religious scriptures\n(and religion) as aiming\u2014through its external meanings\u2014to\naddress the imaginative needs of the average person, Maimonides has a\nbroader understanding of the external layer of the text: For\nMaimonides, but not for Averroes, when it comes to the topic of divine\nembodiment, even the external layer of text, when carefully read,\noffers a non-anthropomorphic set of meanings. In line with his strong\nsense that even the average religious person must be taught that God\nis incorporeal, Maimonides sees the Bible\u2019s external claims about\ndivine corporeality as themselves beckoning\u2014even within the\nexternal layer of the text\u2014to non-corporeal meanings, even for\nthe average person. Averroes does not share this sense and, as Pines\nputs it, instead feels that \u201cthe simple faith of the average\nnonphilosophical person should not be troubled; and he should be left\nfree to stick to his own unsophisticated beliefs even in such matters\nas the corporeality of God\u201d (Pines 1969, cxix).\n\n\nStroumsa sees Maimonides as actively responding to Averroes on this\nvery point at Guide 2.25 where he emphasizes that the \u201cintention\nof the text\u201d is to offer, even at the external level, a\nnon-corporeal interpretation of anthropomorphic claims about God;\nStroumsa sees this as a response on Maimonides part to Averroes\u2019 own\ntalk of the \u201cintention of the Lawgiver\u201d which, on the\ncontrary, ensures that the external meaning of the scriptural text is\nsimply an imaginative teaching about divine corporeality aimed to\naccommodate the average person\u2019s need for\n images.[31] Reflecting\n on some of the hermeneutical tensions (or subtleties) in\nMaimonides\u2019 work, Stroumsa identifies the influence of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Fay\u1e63al where Maimonides tries to save\nmidrashic ideas by describing them as allegories, and the influence of\nAverroes where Maimonides emphasizes the importance of the reader\u2019s\nstaying within the limits of her ability to understand\ntruths.[32]\n7.3 Dynamic Writing\n\n\nMoving from Maimonides' allegorical rendering of the Bible, we might\nnote too his use of a dynamic of external and internal senses in the\nvery construction of his own treatise, a dynamism which can be seen\nearlier in an even more emphatic form in Avicenna's own elaborate\n\u201cvisionary recitals \u201d (see Corbin 1960).  Seen in\nMaimonides own construction of parables (see Guide 3.51 for the\nparable of the palace), in his use of metaphors, in his allegorical\nrenderings of Biblical verses, but also more broadly in the overall\nconstruction of the Guide (in his leaving lots of ambiguities and in\nhis giving voice to outright contradictions), the creative spirit of\n\u201cinner vs. outer\u201d reading and writing strategies is part\nof what makes it so difficult to interpret Maimonides on such\nimportant topics as creation, providence, and immortality. In fact,\nMaimonides prefaces his Guide with a list of seven reasons for\n\u201ccontradictory or contrary statements\u201d (G Intro, P 17) in\nbooks, together with the overt declaration that the Guide itself will\ncontain \u201cdivergencies\u201d which may be explained in light of\nthe list.  Reflecting on the writing dynamics at play in his own text,\nMaimonides explains:\n\n\nDivergences that are to be found in this Treatise are due to the fifth\ncause and the seventh. Know this, grasp its true meaning, and remember\nit very well so as not to become perplexed by some of its chapters. (G\nIntro, P 17)\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth cause of contradictory writing is related by Maimonides to\n\u201cthe necessity of teaching and making someone understand\u201d\n(G Intro, P 17-18), whereas the seventh is related to the necessity of\n\u201cconceal[ing] some parts\u201d and \u201cdisclos[ing]\nothers\u201d when it comes to treating \u201cvery obscure matters\n\u201d (G Intro, P 17).  And while he does not cite the third cause\nas one of his own strategies of writing, he does cite it as a\nprinciple at play in the prophetic Scriptures; returning us again to\nthe idea of \u201cexternal\u201d vs. \u201cinternal\u201d senses,\nthis is the case in which,\n\n\n[n]ot all the statements in question are to be taken in their external\nsense; some are to be taken in their external sense, while some others\nare parables and hence have an inner content\u2026 (G Intro, P 17)\n\n\n\nStarting off his treatise as he does with attention to the dynamics of\ninternal and external meanings (seen too in his reflections on the\ngolden apples and silver casings of Proverbs 25:11), Maimonides\nclearly illustrates his sensitivity to the importance and pedagogical\neffectiveness of various writing and speaking strategies in which\nmeanings are hidden, surface senses meet inner senses, and\nexpression-via-contradiction is an art form.\n\n\nEvidence of shared ideas between Maimonides and Islamic philosophers\non these themes abounds. As is clear from even the representative\nquotes from Islamic sources cited throughout, these interrelated\nfeatures of imagination, allegory, politics, and religion in\nMaimonides' thought are hallmarks of the political philosophical\nwritings of al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes as well. Here, as\nthroughout our investigation, understanding the Islamic philosophical\ncontext of the Guide is key for understanding the intricacies of\nMaimonides' thought.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">A.
