    "main_text": "Atomism in Classical Indian Philosophy || Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism\n1.1 Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika systems developed separately,\nthe former focusing on epistemological issues and the latter on\nontology. Nonetheless, there were enough overlap and later\nreconciliations between them that scholars often consider their\npicture of the natural world together. Both schools developed as\ntraditions of commentary on the Upanishads, dating back to 800 BCE\n(Phillips 1995). In contrast to the Buddhist tradition, atoms in these\nsystems of thought were regarded as external material substances that\npersist through change, although\u2014in line with the teachings of\nthe Vedic scriptures\u2014the atoms were thought to be created.\nImportant figures in the textual tradition include Ka\u1e47\u0101da,\nregarded as founder of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school;\nPr\u00e1sastap\u0101da, author of the first surviving commentary;\nGautama (ca. 150 CE); V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (ca. 400 CE). The work of\nUdayana (11th c. CE) and Ga\u00f1ge\u015ba (c. 1325 CE) gave rise to\na new school, Navya- Ny\u0101ya, that largely merged the two\ntraditions (Matilal 1977; Phillips 1995; Ganeri 2019).\n\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism developed in constant dialogue\nwith other Indian philosophical schools: in a context where Buddhism\noffered a compelling narrative of personal salvation through\ndetachment from the unrealities of the experienced world, some Hindu\nphilosophers responded by bolstering their case for the realism of the\nexperienced world, and real atomic substances were invoked to explain\nboth mental and physical events (Ganeri 2011, 167\u20138). The idea\nthat experienced properties inhere in real external substances was\nused to account for intersubjective agreement about the external\nworld.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory posited different kinds of\natoms for each of the elements earth, water, air and fire, in contrast\nto the Jaina theory that there is a single homogenous matter out of\nwhich everything is composed (Gangopadhyaya 1980). Atoms were regarded\nas substances and bearers of different attributes. Different clusters\nof properties were ascribed to atoms of different kinds (Dasgupta\n1987; Chatterjee 2017). In contrast to the Greek atomists, who denied\nthat sensible properties really inhere in atoms at all, atoms of\ndifferent elements are thought to have perceptible properties, such as\ncold for water atoms. Some theorists allow for the possibility of\naltering the fundamental properties of atoms by heating (Thakar 2003).\nFor atomists in the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika systems, who held\nthat the atoms are made of fundamentally different matter, there is a\nproblem of explaining how properties of one kind of atom can affect an\natom of a different kind, i.e. how the viscosity of water atoms is\nable to combine with earth atoms and to change their consistency\n(Gangopadhyaya 1980, 34).\n\nAtoms combine into dyads and triads before they aggregate into bodies\nof a kind that can be perceived. The theory however faced a question\nhow atoms can combine, if they are indeed partless: unless we can\ndistinguish different parts to an atom, it is difficult to see how\nthey can be said to be next to one another\u2014side by\nside\u2014any more than mathematical points can be said to join\ntogether rather than collapsing into a single point. The response is\nto deny the analogy to points, since atoms are tangible entities and\ntwo of them cannot occupy the same place (Bhaduri 1947, 63), thus\natoms do not lose their identity when they aggregate. Another approach\nto the problem is due to Vasubandhu in the Buddhist tradition (see\nCarpenter 2021).\n\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism also faced the challenge that\ntheir theory was only based on logical inference and could not be\nconfirmed by experience (Bhaduri 1947, 58). In the atomism of Gautama,\nrecognizing the reality of composites is important to secure the basis\nfor knowledge, since atoms themselves are too small to be seen.\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana supports this conclusion empirically, pointing\nout that a forest may be visible from a distance where the individual\ntrees are not (Sarkar 2021). In an ongoing controversy with Buddhist\nphilosophers over the reality of composite entities, Ny\u0101ya\natomists denied that we are aware of composites only indirectly or by\nmeans of awareness of individual parts (Matilal 1986, 268).\n\nNy\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomists held that the world was\ncreated when order was imposed on pre-existing matter: the motion of\natoms was ascribed to a divine source. Their analysis of motion and\nits causes employs concepts that have been compared to modern notions\nof force (Kumar 2019). Although the systems had naturalistic leanings,\nunusual motions such as the action of a magnet might be\nascribed\u2014as it was in the European middle ages\u2014to the\nmoral condition of human agents (Matilal 1977, 58). The organization\nof atoms was cited as a proof for the existence of God by the 11th\ncentury CE atomist Udayana (Gangopadhyaya 1980, 36). The mind and self\nor soul\u2014like time and space\u2014was regarded as a distinct\ncategory from material elements, a distinction traced back to the\nclassical scriptures.\n",
