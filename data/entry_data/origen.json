    "preamble": "\n\nOrigen (c. 185\u2013c. 253) was a Christian exegete and theologian,\nwho made copious use of the allegorical method in his commentaries,\nand (though later considered a heretic) laid the foundations of\nphilosophical theology for the church. He was taught by a certain\nAmmonius, whom the majority of scholars identify as Ammonius Saccas,\nthe teacher of Plotinus; many believe, however, that the external\nevidence will not allow us to identify him with the Origen whom\nPlotinus knew as a colleague. He was certainly well-instructed in\nphilosophy and made use of it as an ancillary to the exposition and\nharmonization of scripture. This was the task that he undertook in\nmost of his extant writings, and the more systematic theology is\nfounded on the ecclesiastical doctrines of the Trinity, the\nincarnation, salvation after death and the inerrancy of scripture.\n\nOrigen was the first Christian to speak of three\n\u201chypostases\u201d in the Trinity and to use the term\nhomoousios (though only by analogy) of the relation between\nthe second of these hypostases and the first. The Father, or first\nperson, is nevertheless the only one who is autotheos, God in\nthe fullest sense, whereas the Son is his dunamis or power\nand the Spirit a dependent being, operative only in the elect. All\nthree are eternal and incorporeal, the Son being known as Wisdom in\nrelation to the Father and Logos (reason, word) in relation to the\nworld. In this capacity he is the shepherd of rational beings the\nlogikoi, who, according to his later critics, were said in\nhis lost writings to have been in origin incorporeal beings coeval\nwith the world if not eternal, and currently imprisoned in material\nbodies only because of a cooling in their love. It is not so easy to\ndemonstrate from his extant works that he held the material world in\nsuch contempt, though he certainly holds it to be created out of\nnothing and suspects that the concept of matter is philosophically\nredundant. Souls, in his view, are sent down into bodies (perhaps\nnever more than once, though again some critics impute to him a\ndoctrine of transmigration or chronic falling away from bliss). The\nsoul remains indefeasibly free in its choices, and the misuse of this\nfreedom is the cause of its captivity to the devil.\n\nThe deliverance of the soul is effected by the incarnation of the\nLogos, or second person of the Trinity, who assumes real body but\nremains fully God. His death on the Cross is a ransom to the devil,\nand his resurrection prefigures that of the saints, though he seems to\nimagine the body after death, in Platonic terms, as a tenuous vehicle\nof the soul. Scholars differ as to whether he envisages a final\nabsorption of the body into incorporeal spirit. It is clear that he\nexpects the vast majority of souls to endure a fiery purification\nafter death, and that no soul will be excluded by God\u2019s will\nfrom this purgatory. While he thinks it possible that some may be too\ndebauched by their sins to repent, he also opines that the devil\nhimself will at last make peace with God, though he cannot attain\nbeatitude. In the present life, an anticipation of bliss in the\npresence of Christ can be enjoyed by the exegete who has fully\nmastered the spiritual meaning of the scriptures. These are the word\nof God to us because Christ the word is ubiquitously present in them,\ninvesting them with a threefold sense as he himself assumed body, soul\nand spirit for our sake in his sojourn on earth.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Origen\u2019s life and work\n\nThe Greek name Origenes signifies \u201cborn of Horus,\u201d an\nEgyptian falcon-headed deity. The Christian scholar of this name was a\nnative of Alexandria (Eusebius, Church History 6.1), though\nit is only his detractor Epiphanius who says that he was also by race\na Copt (Panarion 1.1). Eusebius records the jibe of the\nNeoplatonist Porphyry that Origen, though a Greek by education, became\na Christian, whereas his philosophy teacher Ammonius, having once been\na Christian, converted to a more lawful way of life (Church\nHistory 6.19.7). Although most scholars assume that this is\nAmmonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus, there was another\nphilosopher of the same name, who is credited with \u201cunequalled\npolymathy\u201d by the philosopher Longinus at Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 20.49\u201350. (For further information see Edwards\n1993: 179.) Eusebius, moreover, asserts that both Origen and his\nteacher were Christians throughout their lives (6.19.10); as evidence\nof the latter\u2019s Christianity in his youth, he records that his\nfather Leontius died as a martyr in 202, and that Origen himself, then\n17, not only exhorted Leontius to persevere but thirsted for the same\ndeath (6.2.7). His mother could curb his enthusiasm only by hiding his\nclothes so that he was ashamed to leave the house (6.2.6). Eusebius\nalso tells us that his sexual diffidence or his ascetic temper induced\nOrigen to make himself literally a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven\n(6.8.2); the act is not unparalleled (Markschies 2007: 15\u201334),\nbut Epiphanius was unable to verify the story (Panarion\n64.2).\n\nAfter his father\u2019s death, Origen devoted himself to scholarship\nand became a notable teacher, perhaps succeeding Clement as head of\nthe catechetical school in Alexandria (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.3.1 and 6.7\u20138.1; but cf. Osborn 2008:\n19\u201321). He appears to have studied Hebrew with a converted Jew\n(First Principles 1.3.4 etc.), and one of his letters alludes\nto his studies in philosophy with an unnamed teacher (Eusebius,\nChurch History 6.19.13). Among the works Eusebius says that\nhe composed at this time, dictating to \u201cmore than seven\nstenographers\u201d (6.23.2), were the first five books of his\nCommentary on John, eight books of a Commentary on\nGenesis, two books On the Resurrection and his major\nsurviving work, a synthesis of scriptural teaching under the name\nFirst Principles (6.24). Of these the last survives entire,\nbut only in the Latin of Rufinus. A few books of the Commentary on\nJohn survive in Greek, while portions of the work on the\nresurrection were preserved in a rejoinder by Methodius of Olympia,\nwhich itself survives only in the excerpts and epitomes of later\nauthors (see Dechow 1977). It was also in Alexandria, in imitation of\nthe Homeric scholars of the Hellenistic era, that Origen addressed\nhimself to the preparation of his great Hexapla, in which a corrected\nedition of the Septuagint, the original, allegedly inspired\ntranslation of the Hebrew scriptures (3rd c. BC?), stood in\nparallel to the Hebrew and the renderings of other Greek translators\n(Eusebius, Church History 6.16. See further Neusch\u00e4fer\n1987; Dorival 2013).\n\nAccording to Eusebius, his talents excited the jealousy of Demetrius,\nthe Bishop of Alexandria, who cited his self-castration as a reason\nfor refusing to ordain him as a presbyter (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.8.4\u20135). Nevertheless, when Origen left Alexandria\nin 216 to escape the ferocity of the Emperor Caracalla, Demetrius\nrecalled him from Caesarea, where he had already begun to increase his\nreputation (6.19.16\u201319). On a subsequent visit to Caesarea he\nwas ordained a presbyter, and took up residence in the city (6.8.5;\n6.23.4). Having commenced a commentary on the Song of Songs in the\ncourse of a sojourn in Athens (6.32.2), he completed this in Caesarea,\ntogether with his Commentary on Matthew and his refutation of\nthe True Logos, a pagan satire on Christianity written around\n170 by an otherwise unknown Celsus (6.36.2). Never rising above the\nrank of presbyter, he was often employed, according to the custom of\nthe times, as a mouthpiece of orthodoxy in trials of heretics before\nan episcopal synod. Eusebius commends his refutation of Beryllus of\nBostra (6.33), adding that he was summoned to play a similar role in\nArabia (6.37), and that in his books he tore the mask from heresies\nold and new. To this period of his life we should also date the\nDialogue with Heraclides, discovered at Tura in 1951\n(Chadwick 1959). Yet even at the height of his career, his orthodoxy\nwas impugned. Jerome knows of a letter in which he rebuts the\naccusation that he had prophesied the salvation of the devil (Crouzel\n1973); the same letter indicates, according to Jerome, that his\nteachings had given offence to Heraclas, his former student who had\nnow succeeded Demetrius as bishop of Alexandria. It is clear at least\nthat no censure was extended to Dionysius, the successor of Heraclas\nand another of Origen\u2019s pupils. In Caesarea the ageing\ntheologian suffered tortures under Decius in 251 (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.39.5) and, according to Eusebius, died as Gallus came\nto the throne in 253 (7.1.1). His assertion that Origen was then in\nhis seventieth year is inconsistent with the date implied for his\nbirth (185). Most scholars have elected to postpone the death of\nOrigen to 254 or 255, without explaining why they think the biographer\nmore likely to have erred with regard to the year of his\nsubject\u2019s birth than that of his death. \n\nHis library in Caesarea was inherited by his admirer Pamphilus, then\nby Eusebius as a disciple of Pamphilus and bishop of that city. It\nalso fell to Eusebius to finish the Apology which Pamphilus\nhad begun to write against Origen\u2019s first detractors. From this\nwork and the philippics of such enemies of Origen as Jerome,\nTheophilus of Alexandria, Epiphanius of Salamis, and the Emperor\nJustinian, we can cull fragments of writings that have otherwise\nperished (see further Clark 1992). We also possess an anthology of\nchoice excerpts from his writings the Philokalia (McLynn\n2004), and two short texts On Prayer and To the\nMartyrs. Much had already been lost by attrition in the time of\nEusebius (died c. 339); more may have perished after Origen was\nanathematized in or around the year 553. Many of Origen\u2019s\nCommentaries and Homilies, like the First Principles, survive\nonly in the Latin of Rufinus, who translated him in the fourth century\nwith reverence but not always with fidelity (see further Pace 1990).\nThe following synopsis of Origen\u2019s thought is based primarily on\nthe extant corpus in Greek and Latin, making use of polemical matter\nonly with the caution that is now enjoined by the most learned\nscholars.\n2. The intellectual milieu\n\nScholars are apt to speak casually of Origen\u2019s Platonism, more\ntechnically of his \u201cmiddle\u201d Platonism, most commonly, and\nnot often with conscious paradox, of his Christian Platonism. The\nLutheran theologian Anders Nygren (1953), who protested that a\nChristian Platonist is not a Christian, differed only in his judgment\nof the facts, not in his reading of them, from his critics J.M. Rist\n(1964) and Catherine Osborne (1994), who maintained that Platonism in\nOrigen\u2019s hands was not so much an adulteration as a salutary\nrefinement of the gospel. Nevertheless, whatever the merits of\nNygren\u2019s theology, Origen would have agreed with him in the\nmatter of nomenclature. The majority of his explicit references to\nPlato are to be found in the work Against Celsus, a reply to\na dead polemicist who is nowadays characterized as a middle Platonist,\nthough Origen hints that he may have been an Epicurean (Against\nCelsus 1.8; see further Bergjan 2001). Origen undertakes to show\nthat the simplest disciple of God\u2019s word knows him better than\nthe philosophers who seek him by their own methods (Against\nCelsus 7.42), that Plato misrepresents the fall and diminishes\nthe Creator, that if his myths are deep, the biblical allegories are\ndeeper and less perverse, and that Numenius, the foremost Platonist of\nrecent times, has spoken of both Moses and Jesus with esteem\n(Against Celsus 4.51 etc.).\n\nThe Bible (consisting for Origen only of the New Testament and the\nSeptuagint) is the matrix of every argument in this as in all his\nwritings; while it would be naive, and a contradiction of his own\npractice, to deny that his exegesis was conditioned by philosophical\nassumptions, the propaedeutic to biblical study in his school at\nCaesarea was not Platonism but a professedly unprejudiced survey of\nall the Greek schools. We learn this from his pupil Gregory\nThaumaturgus (Panegyric 13.151\u2013152), to whom he also\nwrote a letter assigning to Greek thought an ancillary role in the\nelucidation of the scriptures; while he was less inclined than his\npredecessors to accuse the Greeks of plagiarizing their philosophical\nviews from the books of Moses, he held that, since every exercise of\nreason is inspired by Christ the Logos, a Christian has as much right\nto the tools of pagan philosophy as the Israelites had to reimburse\ntheir labour from the \u201cspoils of the Egyptians\u201d\n(Philokalia 13; see further Martens 2012: 29\u201333).\nTheologians have at last begun to take Origen at his word as an\ninterpreter of the scriptures; this is not to say that all other\ninfluences are ignored, but that he is thought to deserve the same\ncourtesy that Classicists show to Plotinus when they acknowledge that\neven doctrines which he consciously shares with the Stoics or\nAristotle can be derived without subterfuge from the text of\nPlato.\n\nThe epithet \u201cPlatonist\u201d will of course be warranted if\nOrigen the Christian is identified with the Origen whom Porphyry\nrepresents as one of the privileged disciples of Ammonius Saccas, the\nAlexandrian teacher of Plotinus. According to Porphyry (Life of\nPlotinus 3.20\u201338) this Origen swore an oath with Plotinus\nand a third disciple, Herennius, not to reveal the esoteric doctrines\nof Ammonius after the latter\u2019s death in 243 A.D. This story\nimplies both personal intimacy and geographical proximity, yet Origen\nthe Christian was at this time almost sixty (twenty years senior to\nPlotinus), had left Alexandria for Caesarea some years before, and\nalready had a multitude of books to his name as a Christian teacher.\nPorphyry does not allude to these lucubrations in his Life of\nPlotinus, but says that the Origen he refers to breached the pact\nby issuing first a treatise On Daemons, then another, with\nthe title That the King is the Only Maker, in the reign of\nGallienus (253\u2013268). He includes in the Life a letter,\nwritten in 262 or 263 by his former tutor Longinus, which ascribes to\nOrigen only the work On Daemons (Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 20.36\u201345). All scholars agree that Origen the\nChristian could not have written anything in the last years of\nGallienus; if we can trust Eusebius, he did not live to see this reign\nat all, but died in that of Gallienus\u2019 predecessor Gallus\n(251\u2013253). So, if this Origen is our author, Porphyry must at\nleast have misstated the period at which he violated the agreement.\nThose who contend that there was only one Origen reply that it is the\nchronology of Eusebius that must be flawed because, although his\naccount of Origen\u2019s youth implies that he was born in 185, he\nasserts that his death occurred in his seventieth year, and hence not\nearlier than 254, the first year of Gallienus. The same apologists\nargue that Porphyry fails to mention his Christian writings either\nbecause he despised them or (more cogently) because the publication of\nthem did not violate the oath (cf. Ramelli 2009). If this argument is\nto prevail, a reason must also be furnished for the silence of\nLonginus on this part of Origen\u2019s work, the Christian works of\nOrigen must be regarded as aids (in some degree) to the reconstruction\nof the teaching of Ammonius, and something must be said to explain the\nfailure of Origen\u2019s Christian detractors in late antiquity to\ncite the two works\u2014still extant, according to\nProclus\u2014which he added to the Neoplatonic canon. For these\nreasons, while theologians have often maintained, or simply assumed,\nthe identity of the two Origens, the author of the article on Origen\nin the Oxford Classical Dictionary asserts that the contrary\nposition is nowadays the more widely held (Smith 2012; see further\nEdwards 1993). \n3. Doctrine of God\n\nThe opening chapter of Origen\u2019s First Principles is a\nparadigmatic instance of his application of philosophic reasoning to\nbiblical exegesis. He assumes here what he asserts elsewhere, that the\nnature of God is known to us only by his own revelation in the sacred\ntext. The scriptures tell us both that God is fire and that God is\nspirit, but Origen warns us not to deduce, from a literal construction\nof these terms, that he is a body (Princ. 1.1.1). It is\npossible but not certain, that he has in mind the Stoicizing theology\nof Tertullian: the Bible speaks more plainly on this matter than any\nStoic, and few of Origen\u2019s contemporaries would have doubted the\ncorporeality of fire or spirit. In urging the contrary position, that\nGod is incorporeal. Origen speaks not only for the Platonists but for\nall the Greek apologists of the church: the prevalent thought of his\ntime (and perhaps of ours) required that if God is to be invisible,\nimmutable, eternal, omnipresent, and irresistible in power he must not\nbe confined to one place or composed of labile matter. The\nphilosophical sympathies of Origen become evident when he goes on to\nequate this bodiless god with nous or intellect. In Plato,\nnous had been an occasional synonym for the Demiurge, while\nNumenius of Apamea, half a century before Origen, had subordinated the\nDemiurge, as a second nous, to the \u201cfirst\nnous\u201d, which is Plato\u2019s form of the Good.\nAlthough the Good in Plato is superior to ousia or being,\nNumenius like the majority of Platonists before Origen, appears to\nhave posited nothing higher than intellect; Origen too\u2014in this\nrespect a good Platonist\u2014is less inclined to apophatic theology\nthan Philo the Alexandrian Jew or his Christian predecessors in Egypt,\nClement and Basilides. To explain the selective use of the definite\narticle in John 1.1, he characterizes the Father (ho theos)\nas autotheos, very God, in contrast to the Son who is merely\ntheos (CommJohn 2.7.16\u201318); when he suggests,\nhowever, that the Father is higher than nous (Against\nCelsus 7.45), he does not develop a metaphysical theory, any more\nthan he develops his hint in the same work that God may be the\nAristotelian \u201cthought of thoughts\u201d (see further Whittaker\n1969). Tobias B\u00f6hm\u2019s ingenious suggestion (2002) that for\nOrigen the being of God is his nous, and his unity that which\nis higher than nous, assumes that he was acquainted with the\nfirst and second hypotheses of the Parmenides, a dialogue of\nwhich he evinces little knowledge in his extant works. \n\nWhether he is noetic or supranoetic, Origen\u2019s God cannot be\nknown to us in his essence, nor is it by his ousia, or\nessence, but by his dunamis, or power, that he acts upon\nother beings (On Prayer 25.3). His dunamis, which is\ninfinite and mediated by the second person of the Trinity, is the\nsource of every dunamis that is exercised by his creatures,\neven by those who have fallen into apostasy and rebellion\n(CommJohn 1.39.291). On the other hand nothing, not even the\nsecond person, proceeds directly from the immutable ousia of\nGod (CommJohn 13.25.153 and 20.18.157: see below). Yet, while\nhe asserts that God is by nature impassible\u2014in the sense that he\nis the agent, not the patient, in every transaction and cannot be\nmoved by any external force\u2014Origen is one of the first\ntheologians to assert that he can suffer, in a sense, as God, and not\nonly by virtue of the incarnation (Homilies on Ezekiel 6.1;\nsee Osborn 1994: 164\u2013184). This suffering takes the form of\ncommiseration for the plight of his sinful creatures, never of sorrow\non his own account. Compassion supposes knowledge, and Origen appears\nto have been untroubled by the difficulties that arise from the\nascription of contingent knowledge to an eternal being. That God\ntranscends the temporal order is evident from his answer to those who\nask what God was doing before he created the world: the question, he\nargues, presupposes a time before the beginning of the world, but\nreflection teaches us that time and the revolutions of the cosmos are\ncoeval (Princ. 3.5.3). This is a Platonic doctrine, but it\nhad now become common for Platonists to argue, in submission to\nAristotle, that the temporal world has neither end nor beginning and\nis \u201cgenerated\u201d only in the sense that it is a theatre of\nvicissitude, in which all that exists has come into being and will\npass away. \n\nThe agent whom we call the Second Person of the Trinity is\n\u201canother god\u201d at Dialogue with Heraclides 2 and a\n\u201csecond god\u201d on two occasions in his work Against\nCelsus (5.39, 5.61). This appellation is not attested in earlier\nChristian prose, though it is anticipated in Philo and Numenius. It\ndoes not occur in works addressed by Origen to Christians of sound\nfaith, not even in those which show no fear of subordinating the Son\nto the Father\u2014an indication perhaps that it was avoided because\nit savoured of polytheism and not because it belied the equality of\nthe divine persons (Edwards 2006). It seems that in Numenius it is the\ncontemplation of the first intellect by the second that gives rise to\nthe forms, or Platonic ideas; Origen, as a Christian, holds that the\ncontemplation is mutual, since \u201cno-one knows the Son but the\nFather and no-one knows the Father but the Son\u201d (Matthew 11.27).\nThus he maintains, on the one hand, that the Son, as truth (John\n14.6), knows all that is in the mind of the Father; the infamous\nproviso that the Son does not see the Father signifies only that\nwithin the Godhead vision is not mediated by our physical organs\n(Princ. 1.1.8). On the other hand, when we read that the Son\nis the wisdom and power of the Father (1 Corinthians 1.24) and that\nthe world was created through him (Hebrews 1.2), we are to understand\nthat he is that divine helpmate who declares at Proverbs 8.22 that the\nLord created her in the beginning of his ways, and at Wisdom 7.26 that\nshe is the mirror of his unspotted majesty. The verb\n\u201ccreated\u201d in this text (which Origen prefers to the\nalternative reading \u201cpossessed\u201d) does not imply that the\nSon has a temporal beginning, but that, having no other substrate than\nthe Father\u2019s will, he expresses that will more perfectly than\nthe things that are \u201cmade\u201d from matter. It is\ninconceivable that the Father could ever have lacked wisdom, and\nequally inconceivable to Origen that this wisdom could ever have taken\na different form from the one that it now possesses as the second\nperson or hypostasis of the Trinity (Princ. 1.2.2). He is the\nfirst theologian to state unequivocally that the \u201cthree\nhypostases\u201d which constitute the Trinity are eternal not only in\nnature, but in their hypostatic character; there was never a time when\nwisdom was the latent thought of the Father and had not yet come forth\nas speech.\n\nThough Origen rejects it, this was in fact the prevailing thesis of\nmost Christian writing in the second century when it undertook to\nexplain the Fourth Evangelist\u2019s assertion that the one who\nbecame incarnate was the Logos who had been with the Father as\ntheos (god) if not ho theos (God) from the beginning\n(John 1.1). Since it was this speech or word that created the world,\nit was argued, there would have been no reason for it to exist before\nthe creation as a distinct hypostasis. If he existed at all, it was as\nthe logos endiathetos, the word within, which had not yet\nemerged from the mind as logos prophorikos, or verbal\nutterance. In this latent phase he could be identified (as Philo had\nalready argued) with the paradigm, or world of forms, which supplies\nthe Platonic demiurge with his pattern for the creation. Clement of\nAlexandria accepts this equation, albeit perhaps without denying the\nhypostatic eternity of the Logos (Edwards 2000). Origen, however,\nresists the interpretation of Logos as \u201cspeech\u201d because\nthere are some who take this to imply that the second person is merely\na function or epiphenomenon of the first (CommJohn 1.24.151;\nOrbe 1991). Logos, in his view, is one of the numerous designations\n(epinoiai) which are conferred on the second person to define\nhis relation, not to the Father (as \u201cSon\u201d and\n\u201cWisdom\u201d do) but to his creatures (CommJohn\n2.9.66 etc.): he is Logos as the paradigm and parent of all the\nlogikai, or rational beings, who exercise reason only by\nparticipation in him. He cannot be identified with the world of forms,\nor Platonic ideas, because to Origen these ideas are imaginary\nentities which the Greeks absurdly suppose to be independent of the\nCreator (Princ. 2.3.6). It appears then that he endorsed the\nolder and more literal reading of the Timaeus, according to\nwhich the Demiurge, the forms and matter are three autonomous\nprinciples of being. Before him Philo, Alcinous, and Clement of\nAlexandria had construed the forms as thoughts in the mind of the\nDemiurge, while Alexander of Aphrodisias held that they gave content\nto God\u2019s eternal contemplation of himself (Armstrong 1960).\nOrigen himself opines that all genera, all species and even the\narchetypes of all particular things are eternally present in the mind\nof God (Princ. 1.4.5), but he holds this as a Christian\nantidote to difficulties which arise from the temporality of the\nworld.\n4. The created order\n\nThese difficulties, as Origen perceived, had not been fully resolved\nby the argument that since the world is coeval with time we need not\nask what God was doing before he created it (see further Tzamalikos\n2006: 179\u2013271). From Genesis 1.1 we learn that God created the\nworld in the beginning, and from John 1.1 that the Logos was with him\nin the beginning; but as we are also told that God created all things\nin wisdom, Origen takes this beginning to be not a temporal origin but\nthe eternal desideratum of existence who is also the second person of\nthe Trinity (CommJohn 1.39.289). It follows, however, that if\nthis temporal world is the only one, an infinite cause has exhausted\nitself in a finite effect. Perhaps it was in the hope of evading this\nparadox that Origen interpreted Solomon\u2019s dictum, \u201cthere\nis nothing new under the sun\u201d (Ecclesiastes 1.10) to mean that\nworlds have existed before the present one (Princ. 3.1.6).\nThis manoeuvre, however, will bring no escape unless one posits an\ninfinite succession of worlds before and after the present one, and\neven Origen\u2019s enemies do not say that he went so far. An endless\nseries, after all, would be sempiternal rather than eternal, and the\nStoics might have replied that their belief in the perpetual\nreduplication of the same cosmos\u2014a belief disowned by\nOrigen (Cels. 4. 68)\u2014comes closer to matching timeless\nactivity with a timeless product. A better solution than either of\nthese, in Origen\u2019s view, was to posit a noetic realm, created\nbut eternal, populated by logika, or rational entities, under\nthe hegemony of the logos, and preceding ours in the ontological\nhierarchy rather than in the temporal continuum (Princ.\n2.9.4). Evidence for this conceit could be found in the creation of a\nheaven and earth at Genesis 1.1 before the creation of the visible\nfirmament (Genesis Homilies 1.5). To the modern mind this is\nforced exegesis, representing the triumph of philosophy over\nphilology; the philosophy, however, is not that of any Greek school,\nbut of a Christian who has set himself a conundrum by his fidelity to\nMoses. It is a striking observation, however we explain it, that the\nforms of particular things which coexist in the mind of Origen\u2019s\nGod with the genera and species are not attested in any pagan\nPlatonist before Plotinus, his younger contemporary and (as most\nbelieve) a fellow-pupil of Ammonius Saccas (cf. Plotinus,\nEnneads 5.7).\n\nAs the absolute and transcendent dunamis of the Father\n(Cels. 1.66; CommJohn 1.18.107 etc.), the second\nperson is properly the lord of every dunamis in heaven and\nearth (Cels. 5.45). At the same time, it can be said that he\nis the food of the celestial dunameis who have remained true\nto the Creator, while Satan is the food of those who have fallen\n(On Prayer 27.12). It is the angelic dunameis who\nkeep watch over his cradle at the time of his nativity (Cels.\n1.61), and who sometimes form a retinue at the scenes where he\nperforms those works of power which we call miracles\n(CommJohn 2.4.40). This polysemic usage of the term, which\nmirrors that of the New Testament, presents no difficulty so long as\nevery other dunamis is conceived as a lower or local\nmanifestation of the undivided power which appertains to him as Logos.\nAs we have seen, this term defines his hegemonic relation to the\ncreated order; Wisdom is another of his biblical appellations, yet\nthis Wisdom is the beginning in which the Logos was with God\n(CommJohn 1.39.289; see further Tzamalikos 2006:\n119\u2013178). However one accounts for these obscurities, it seems\nunlikely that Origen could have signed the Nicene Creed of 325, in\nwhich the Son is declared to be from the ousia of the Father,\nand therefore homoousios (of one essence, substance or\nnature) with him (cf. CommJohn 20.18.157). A community of\nnature between the two is asserted, however, at CommJohn\n2.10.76); and in his Commentary on Hebrews, he deduces from\nWisdom 7.26, where Wisdom is styled an aporroia or emanation\nof the Father, that the relation between the two persons of the\nTrinity is analogous to that which holds between an ointment and the\nexhalation which is homoousios with it (Pamphilus,\nApology 99\u2013104; see Edwards 1998). Thus he can make\noblique use of a term which he cannot predicate directly of\nincorporeals; Plotinus, who could have done so, could not have said\nthat nous was homoousios with the One because the\nlatter is superior to ousia.which can be posited only at the\nlevel of nous. \n\nAlthough the Son is not \u201cfrom the ousia\u201d of the\nFather, he is said in the Latin translation of Origen\u2019s\nCommentary on Hebrews to be ex substantia patris,\nfrom the hypostasis of the Father. That hypostasis,\nnot ousia, was the original noun in Greek can be deduced from\nthe text of Hebrews 1.3, where the Son is described as an impression\nof his [the Father\u2019s] hypostasis. Here\nhypostasis appears to signify the reality disclosed by a\nphenomenon; the formula ex substantia patris was already\naxiomatic for Origen\u2019s African contemporary Tertullian\n(Against Praxeas 7.9). In Latin of this period\nsubstantia was used indifferently to represent both\nhypostasis and ousia; these Greek terms are not\nexplicitly distinguished in Origen\u2019s writings, though he\nrefrains from attributing either one ousia or three to the\nGodhead. Some difference in concreteness is implied by his strictures\non those who fail to qualify the ousia of the Son and thus\ndeny him a hypostasis altogether (CommJoh 1.24.152):\nit seems, then that the hypostasis is a specific\ndetermination of the more generic ousia. Origen stipulates in\nhis treatise On Prayer (15.1) that the Son should not receive\nthe prayer of adoration which is offered to the Father because he\ndiffers from the Father in ousia and in substrate\n(hupokeimenon); the latter word is best understood with\nreference to the body that he assumed in the incarnation, and we\ncannot therefore be sure whether the ousia of which Origen\nspeaks is that of the exalted Christ in his eternal or his human\ncharacter. It is generally true that he takes fewer pains than later\nChristian authors to winnow what is said of the Son as second person\nof the Trinity from what is said of him as Jesus of Nazareth. When he\ncompares the Father to a statue of infinite magnitude and the Son to a\nsmaller statue accommodated to our perceptions, he begins as though\nthe visible were a metaphor for the invisible, but ends by quoting\nPhilippians 2.7 on the manifestation of Christ in the form of a slave\n(Princ. 1.2.6).\n\nOrigen strongly affirms the ontological dependence of the Spirit, or\nthird hypostasis of the Trinity, on the second. To say otherwise would\nbe to deny that he was brought into being, since the author of all\nthat was brought into being, according to John 1.3, is the Son or\nLogos. It would be truer, however, to say that the Spirit did not come\ninto being without the Son than that he came into being through him\n(CommJohn 2.12.17\u201319). The Spirit, as\nhypostasis, is not only eternal but incorporeal in the\nstrictest sense: this follows from First Principles 1.6.4,\nwhere Origen finds it impossible to imagine that any being apart from\nthe members of the Trinity can subsist without a body. If these\npersons were incorporeal only in the looser sense that Origen\nrecognises in First Principles, proem 10, he could not have\ndrawn such an antithesis between the Godhead and the angelic creation.\nThe powers and operations of the Spirit are not so clearly delineated\nin his writings, as those of the other two persons; the same could be\nsaid of almost any writer before Nicaea, and the cause, no doubt, is\nthe absence of unanimity in the scriptures. It is the Spirit who moves\n(or broods) on the face of the waters before creation at Genesis 1.2;\nat John 1.3 the Logos supplants the Spirit, which is now said at John\n7.39 to have been given only when Jesus was glorified at the end of\nhis ministry. Origen follows John when he writes that the Father is at\nwork in the entire creation, the Son in those beings who possess\nlogos or reason, and the Spirit in the elect (Justinian,\nTo Menas; cf. Princ. 1.3.5). It may be that this\nrestriction of the Son\u2019s office implies a Greek rather than a\nbiblical understanding of the term logos, but Greek thought\nknows of no supernal being who acts in the realm assigned by Origen to\nthe Spirit (pace Dillon 1982). This Trinitarian hierarchy has\nbeen compared with that of the noetic principles being, life and mind\nin the system of Proclus, for whom being encompasses all that exists,\nlife the more limited sphere of living creatures and mind the still\nmore limited sphere of the rational. The correspondence, however, is\nfar from exact, and, as Proclus wrote two centuries after Origen and\nunder later influences, more compelling arguments will be required\nbefore we assign to a Platonic source the doctrine that Origen draws\nso effortlessly from the scriptures. No evidence has been produced to\nshow that the Spirit functions in Origen as the soul of the world; he\nsurmises on one occasion that the Logos is the soul of God\n(Princ. 2.8.5), but only because he needs to account for an\nanthropomorphic metaphor at Psalm 84.6. .\n\nThat the Godhead is incorporeal\u2014and therefore, in Origen\u2019s\nlexicon, immaterial\u2014is, as we have seen, an unassailable premiss\nof his theology. If the second person has any substrate\u2014any\nmatter, as we might say\u2014it is the will of God the Father. The\nsignificance of this doctrine becomes apparent when we recall that\nChrist is wisdom and that in the myth attributed to the Gnostic\nPtolemaeus, the error of wisdom lies in her acting without the assent\nof her consort Thelema, or Will (Irenaeus, Against Heresies\n1.1\u20134). The Father\u2019s will, on the other hand, is not the\nsubstrate but the cause of the material universe, which Origen held,\nwith every orthodox Christian of his day, to have been created out of\nnothing. For most Christians this did not entail that God creates\nwithout matter, but that the matter from which he shaped the world was\nthe first of his creations. Matter had seldom been defined in\nChristian prose before Origen, but for him, as for Aristotle, as he\nhas often been interpreted, it is the unqualified receptacle of all\nqualities, a mere potentiality for existence in contradistinction to\nessence, of which nothing can be predicated until it is actualised as\ndeterminate being. But then follows Bishop Berkeley\u2019s question:\nif matter is not something, why not conclude that it is nothing?\nOrigen is perhaps the first extant writer who informs us that this\nquestion had been posed in his time, though in his accustomed manner\nhe neither affirms it at First Principles 4.4.7 nor names its\nproponents. We must say \u201cperhaps\u201d, because the\nPhilokalia, a florilegium of his writings, contains a short\ndialogue in which the redundancy of matter is established by Socratic\ninterrogation (Philokalia 24). In view of his diffidence in\nFirst Principles, it seems more likely that this text is the\nwork of Maximus, a second-century author to whom it is also attributed\nin our manuscripts.\n5. Theodicy and sin\n\nIt is clear at least that Origen\u2019s God creates the world from\nnothing and without toil or opposition (Princ. 2.1.5).\nBecause he asserts that such a world will inevitably be finite, as God\nhimself cannot comprehend the infinite, Origen was later accused of\nslighting the omnipotence of the Creator. His meaning, however, is not\nthat there are limits to the power of God, but that any particular\nexercise of it must logically have some limit. The infinite is by\nnature incomprehensible; hence it is no shortcoming in God that he\ncannot comprehend it, and he remains omnipotent in the sense that\nthere is no finite enterprise that lies beyond his power. In contrast\nto the Gnostics, therefore, who held that our world is the residue of\na rupture or fall within the Godhead, Origen maintains that a single\nGod is the creator of both the intellectual and the material cosmos.\nHe also purports to demonstrate the priority of the intellectual Adam\nto the material Adam, first by giving an allegorical sense to the\nfirmament which divides the waters at Genesis 1.7, then by a literal\nreading of Genesis 1.26\u20132.22. In this text the creation of\nhumanity as male and female in the image of God, as the crown of his\nhandiwork, is succeeded by a narrative of quite a different tenor, in\nwhich God fashions the body of the first man from the soil and then,\nafter populating the garden with beasts and plants and infusing the\nspirit into his nostrils, derives the body of the first woman from his\nrib (Genesis 2.1\u20137; 2.21\u201325). It is not clear whether a\ntemporal, as well as an ontological, priority is accorded to the inner\nman, or whether the protoplasts owe their creation to his fall.\n\nThat the denizens of the present world have sinned, and will sin\nagain, is a ubiquitous premiss of Origen\u2019s theodicy.\nMisadventures which the world ascribes to fortune, fate or the malice\nof our superhuman guardians will always in fact be trials of virtue,\nchastisements for sin (perhaps forgotten) or correctives to hidden\ninjustice. Thus if we cannot divine (for example) why God loved Jacob\nand hated Esau\u2014the explanation must lie in causes prior to the\nbirth of either (First Principles 2.9.7). Origen may have been aware\nof Jewish speculations that Esau offended God in the womb, but it is\nusually assumed that when he speaks of a \u201cformer life\u201d in\nwhich Esau sinned he alludes to a previous embodiment or to a\ndisembodied state. Perhaps this is why his detractors in late\nantiquity ascribed to him the doctrine that all rational beings were\nonce pure intellects in the presence of God, and would have remained\nso for ever had they not fallen away through koros or\nsatiety. Each of the delinquents, we are told, received a body\ncorresponding to the gravity of the original sin: those who fell least\nbecame angels, those who fell most became demons, and human souls\nconstitute order in keeping with the mediocrity of their\ntransgressions (Antipater of Bostra at Patrologia Graeca\n96.504\u2013505). This account of Origen\u2019s teaching was already\nknown to Augustine, who perceived its incoherence, since it implies\nthat the bodies of demons, who inhabit the air above us, are grosser\nthan ours. In the form that is now canonical, it is a bricolage of\nPlatonic myths recounting the fall of the soul from the\n\u201csupercelestial place\u201d, the peculiarly Christian and\nanti-Platonic concept of the demons as fallen angels, and\nPhilo\u2019s opinion that koros is the cause of the\nsoul\u2019s estrangement from its maker (Heir of Divine\nThings 240). If Origen held such a theory, it was not on the\nPlatonic ground that soul, as the cause of motion, cannot be brought\ninto being and hence must be immortal; his object, typically\nChristian, is to vindicate biblical teaching and at the same time to\nshow that it cannot be used to support any Gnostic or pagan\nanimadversion on divine justice (Martens 2015). Accordingly (though\nsome of his ancient critics pretended otherwise), his writings are\nunequivocal in their rejection of Plato\u2019s theory of\ntransmigration, whether from human to human or from human to beast.\nAlthough these theories (hesitantly accepted even by Platonists in the\nthird century), gain some colour from Jewish traditions about Elijah\nand from punishments meted out to animals under the Levitical law,\nOrigen bows to the wisdom of the church, which declares them\ninadmissible (CommJohn 1.11.66; Princ. 1.8.5).\n\nCertainly at First Principles 1.4.1 he writes that satiety is\nthe commonest cause of falling, but the soul of which he speaks may be\nan embodied one, as it is when it repents a few lines later\n(Princ. 1.4.1). At First Principles 3.5.6, and again\nin his fragmentary commentary on Ephesians, he interprets the noun\nkatabol\u00ea at Ephesians 1.4 as an allusion to the\nsoul\u2019s descent to a body from the hand of God; but this descent,\nwhich is not a fall, is not said to coincide with the creation. We\nread that the soul of Christ adhered to the word with indissoluble\nlove ab initio creationis, but these words could signify\neither \u201cfrom the beginning of the creation\u201d or \u201cfrom\nthe beginning of its creation\u201d (Princ. 2.6.3\u20134).\nAt First Principles 1.7.1 we are said to be properly\nidentical with our rational element; but Gregory of Nyssa and\nAugustine said the same without being understood to mean that we have\never existed as disembodied souls. At Commentary on Matthew 16.35 he\nentertains the theory that souls await embodiment in Sheol, the place\nfrom which the soul of Samuel was raised by the Witch of Endor; since\nhe appears to be hinting here not only at a primordial existence of\nthe soul but at transmigration from body to body, we should not rely\ntoo heavily on this parenthetic chapter in a text which poses more\nthan the usual share of difficulties for its editors. That souls are\nalready rational in the foetal state is evident from the leaping of\nJohn the Baptist in Elizabeth\u2019s womb when he recognises the\nchild in the womb of Mary (Princ. 1.7.4). In his exegesis of\nJohn 1.31, Origen suggests that the Baptist deplores his failure to\nrecognise Jesus at the River Jordan because he has already known him\nin a previous life; since, however, he was prepared to entertain the\ntheory that the Baptist was an angel embodied for our sake, we cannot\ndeduce that Origen credited all souls with a sentient existence before\ntheir entry into this world (CommJohn 2.31.186). That the\nelements are ensouled can be inferred from Isaiah 1.2, where God calls\nheaven and earth to witness; and Job\u2019s exclamation, \u201cthe\nstars are not clean in his sight\u201d is applied by Origen to the\nsun and moon, who have been made \u201csubject to vanity\u201d for\nthe sake of those who inhabit the physical cosmos (Princ.\n1.7.2). Here it may be true that he borrows a tenet from the\nPlatonists, but not without biblical warrant, and the uncleanness of\nthe sun and moon is a consequence of their voluntary enthralment, not\nits cause (see further Scott 1994).\n\nIn Origen\u2019s extant writings, then, the doctrine of the\nsoul\u2019s fall through satiety, after centuries of beatitude as a\n\u201cpure intellect\u201d, is never so clearly stated as in later\nindictments of his heterodoxy. Many hold none the less that the\ncharges are true, and that Origen\u2019s advocacy of these doctrines\nis concealed from us by the loss or mutilation of the incriminating\ntexts. Others, relying chiefly on the texts that have been preserved,\nmaintain that for Origen the fall of souls was a tentative and\noccasional speculation or a myth, in Plato\u2019s sense, that was\nlater mistaken for a dogma (Harl 1987). It has also been argued that\nhis preserved words testify only to Origen\u2019s belief in the fall\nof angels (Princ. 1.5.3) and to the creation of the soul\nbefore its descent into the body; on this view, readers who came to\nhis work with formulaic expectations mingled his own opinions with the\nPlatonic tenets to which they bore a calculated but incomplete\nresemblance. No hypothesis has yet accounted for all that is said in\nthe surviving corpus of Origen\u2019s works. If, as Origen seems to\nhold (Princ. 3.6.1), the likeness of God was not yet\nconferred on the intellectual man who was created in the image of God,\nshould we infer that Adam\u2019s body was given to him as a means of\nacquiring the likeness, just as the Neoplatonist Porphyry, fifty years\nlater, taught that souls are implanted in bodies in order to cultivate\nvirtue through the struggle against temptation? On the other hand, if\nour initial state was in some respects unlike the present one, we may\nfind it hard to interpret Origen\u2019s dictum that the end, or\nconsummation (apokatastasis), is \u201cthe same as the\nbeginning\u201d (Princ. 1.6.2). The provenance of the noun\napokatastasis is more easily established than its meaning,\nfor even in the New Testament it may signify not so much the\nrestoration of that which was once the case as the realisation of that\nwhich ought to be (see further Tzamalikos 2007: 237\u2013356; Ramelli\n2013: 129\u2013221).\n\nAt First Principles 4.4.1 Origen scoffs that only a fool would suppose\nthat God had really planted a garden in Eden, as the second chapter of\nGenesis records. This has been taken to mean that he regards Eden not\nas a physical locality but as the state in which all souls enjoy the\npresence of God before they descend to bodies (Martens, 2013). Yet\nOrigen\u2019s chief concern here is to forestall the literal reading\nof the verb \u201cplanted\u201d, which, like other anthropomorphisms\nin scripture, is likely to mislead a recent convert from idolatry. No\ncritic infers, from Origen\u2019s denial that God descended in a\nbodily sense to destroy the tower of Babel (Against Celsus\n4.15\u201321), that he believes the tower itself to be fictitious; we\nshould therefore not be too ready to assume, with the malignant\nEpiphanius, that he denies the historicity of the when he adopts a\nmetaphorical construction of God\u2019s sewing of coats of skin for\nAdam and Eve at Genesis 3.21 (Epiphanius, Panarion 64.4.1; cf Heidl,\n2003: 138). If he also doubts that the trees of Eden were botanical\nplants, he is equally willing to give up other details in the story of\nbabel, but not the event itself. In a fragment preserved in a Greek\ncatena, he cites Adam\u2019s exclamation \u201cThis is bone of my\nbone and flesh of my flesh at Genesis 2.24 as proof that even before\nthe fall he possessed a body\u201d (Commentary on Genesis,\nFr. 22, p. 190 Metzler); from the sequel, as from Homilies on\nLeviticus 6.2, we may conclude that he held this body to be a\ndifferent texture from ours, but in his own parlance this would be an\ninstance of \u201chomonymy\u201d, the use of a scriptural term in\ndifferent senses which are equally literal. While the sin of Adam is a\nprecedent for all subsequent transgressions in his Commentary on\nRomans, this claim does not preclude, and has even been thought\nto presuppose, the physical descent of all human beings from this one\nancestor (Bammel, 1989). At Against Celsus 7.39 the\nprotoplasts fall from a state of immediate knowledge of God to one in\nwhich the mind is blinded by the senses but nothing is said to imply\nthat they then became corporeal agents for the first time. Of course\nmany ambiguities remain, and grammar alone will not determine whether\nthe phrase \u201call saints who have lived since the foundation of\nthe world\u201d (Martens, 2013: 532)implies that every soul has\nexisted from the beginning or only that from the beginning to the\npresent new souls are coming into existence with their bodies. \n\nHowever the soul\u2019s detention in the present world is accounted\nfor, its freedom to choose its own goods, and its own god, is an\nindefeasible premiss of Origen\u2019s philosophy. Astrologers who\npretend to read our fates from the stars can be answered with a quip\nfrom Epicurus: if all that comes to pass is predestined, so is the\nbelief in predestination, and we therefore have no reason to think it\ntrue (Philokalia 25.4). Even if the stars vouchsafe some\npremonitions of the future to the saints, we are not to suppose that\nthey are the causes of what they signify, or that God, who inscribes\nhis own knowledge in the heavens, is the cause of everything that he\nforesees. Because he is exempt from time, our future lies open to him\nas the past and present lie open; he knows, in the words of Paul,\nwhether each of his creatures is to be a vessel of honour or a vessel\nof dishonour. It is we, however, who make his knowledge true by our\nown choice of good or evil; the Gnostics misconstrue the\napostle\u2019s statement that God \u201cmakes\u201d us vessels of\nhonour or dishonour when they argue that the damned and the elect are\nof different natures. None of us is born virtuous but each of us (as\nAristotle says and common experience goes on telling us) has the power\nto advance in virtue by performing virtuous acts (Princ.\n3.1).\n6. The Work of Christ\n\nNevertheless, since the fall has darkened our minds and subjected our\nbodies to corruption, we cannot effect our own salvation without the\nassistance of God\u2019s word made flesh. For Origen the virgin birth\nis a datable event, an appropriation by the Word of full humanity in\nbody, soul and spirit. The union can be described as an\nanakrasis or mixture (Cels. 3.41), a voluntary\ncleaving of the flesh or soul to the Word, and (in defiance of\nchemical facts) as the sublimation of the humanity by the divinity, as\niron loses its form when held in an incandescent flame\n(Princ. 2.6.4) The humanity, for all that, is not\nannihilated, and Christ can speak at times as man and at others with\nGod without being guilty of dissimulation (CommJohn 19.2.6).\nHis own words \u201cmy soul is sorrowful unto death\u201d reveals\nhis possession of a soul, which mediates between the flesh and the\ndivinity which would otherwise destroy it. While the soul (for Christ\nas for us) is invariably the seat of passion, some of his passions\noriginate in his spirit, which, though human, is divinely irradiated\nby the Word. By virtue of this irradiation, he foresees his own death,\nand his prescience gives rise not to a commotion of the\nspirit but to a commotion in the spirit, which is experienced\nas a passion of the soul (CommJohn\n32.18.221\u2013224). The body which clothes him before the\ncrucifixion is as palpable as ours, and equally vulnerable to physical\naffections. After his resurrection, he does not show himself to\nCaiaphas and Pilate because he is visible only to the eye of faith\n(Cels. 2.60\u201365). This means not, however, that his body\nis no real body, but that it no longer suffers the consequences of the\nfall.\n\nThe blood of Christ, first in his circumcision and then on the Cross,\nis a ransom paid to Satan (Commentary on Romans 2.13.29; cf.\n1 Corinthians 6.23), whose prisoners we become, willingly if\nunwittingly, when we allow his image to oust that of god in our souls\n(Genesis Homilies 1.13). Yet Satan is never master of our\nwills: if he enters the soul of a Judas Iscariot, it is because the\nthought that he plants there has received assent and ripened into a\nsinful disposition (CommJohn 32.281\u2013285; see further\nLayton 2004: 129\u2013131.) We are taught to suppress such thoughts\nand to refrain from sin, by the teaching of Christ, the chief of his\nbounties during his earthly sojourn, which we now receive in even\ngreater measure through the scriptures. As the primordial Word of God,\nhe is present in every word from God that the church has canonised\nunder the direction of the Spirit; the many words of scripture, in\nfact, are one (Philokalia 5.4). When we are instructed to eat\nthe flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, it is clear that the\nwords cannot be taken literally; while Origen does not deny the\nallusion to the eucharist, he argues that the higher sense\u2014but\nalso the quotidian sense\u2014of the saying is that believers must\ndraw nourishment from the scriptures in which Christ \u201cas it\nwere, takes flesh and speaks with a literal voice\u201d in order to\ndraw us on to the invisible mysteries (Cels. 4.15; On\nPrayer 27.10\u201314). The scriptures, then, are the daily bread\nfor which Christians are taught to pray; to accept eating as a\nmetaphor for reading is to acknowledge that whenever the scriptures\nspeak of tasting, hearing or seeing God, they are not only imparting\nwhat we might call a spiritual sense to these words, but appealing to\nour own spiritual senses (Princ. 1.1.9), the loftier\nfaculties which were freely exercised by Adam and Eve before the fall\n(Cels. 7.39; see further Rahner 1979).\n\nTo distinguish only two senses of scripture is to forget that Christ,\nthe true Word, became incarnate in a threefold human nature. At\nFirst Principles 4.2.4, Origen asserts that the body, the\nsoul and the spirit of the human reader find their respective\nanalogues in the text that is being read. The body is the plain text,\nwhether narrative or didactic, construed according to common\ngrammatical or semantic norms. The spirit, which must generally be\nsought beneath the surface, acquaints us with the work of Christ and\nthe mysteries of faith, and thus corresponds to the typological sense\nin mediaeval and modern exegesis. The soul of scripture is illustrated\nby Paul\u2019s translation of the Mosaic precept, \u201cthou shalt\nnot muzzle the ox which treadeth the corn\u201d, to ministers of the\nchurch (Princ. 4.2.6). For this reason, and because the\nchurch is the bride of Christ in Origen\u2019s exposition of the soul\nof the Song of Songs, the term \u201cecclesiastical\u201d has been\napplied to this intermediate plane of reference. In works which\nsurvive in Latin certain passages are said to be amenable to a\nliteral, a moral and a spiritual exposition, but we cannot say whether\nOrigen employed a Greek equivalent to the term \u201cmoral\u201d. It\nis possible that he offers us a further clue to the content of the\npsychic sense in the prologue to his Commentary on the Song of\nSongs (ed. Baehrens 1925: 75), where he argues that each of the\nthree books ascribed to Solomon in the Hebrew canon corresponds to a\nbranch of Greek philosophy, and also to one stage in the\nbeliever\u2019s progress from the foothills to the summit of\nunderstanding. Ethics is represented in this itinerary by Proverbs,\nphysics by Ecclesiastics, the science of contemplation (theorics,\nepoptics or enoptics) by the Song. The first of these texts is phrased\nand may be understood somatically; the third, in which Solomon forgoes\nhis own name and becomes the bridegroom, lifts the veil between the\nenlightened soul and her Redeemer (see further King 2005:\n222\u2013263). If we pursue this seductive analogy, the second book\nof Solomon, which reveals our place in the cosmos, is a mine of\ncosmological or sapiential teaching which may be said to represent the\nsoul of scripture.\n\nThis pattern would appear to have been suggested not by the usual\ndivision of philosophy into ethics, physics and logic, but by a\npassage in Clement of Alexandria, where three edifying senses are\naccorded to the scriptures, the last of which is the\nepopteia, or discernment of the mysteries (Stromateis\n1.176.1\u20132). Origen may also have been aware that certain\nteachers had sorted Plato\u2019s dialogues into different categories,\neach suited to a different level of aptitude in the pupil (Edwards\n1997). If, as some manuscripts indicate, he gave the name\n\u201ctheoric\u201d (either instead of or in addition to\n\u201cepoptic\u201d) to the most elevated level of understanding, he\nmay have had in mind a Platonic or Pythagorean division of philosophy\ninto ethics, physics and theology, which is attested in a commentary\nby Iamblichus on Nicomachus of Gerasa\u2019s Introduction to\nMathematics. In attributing this taxonomy to the Hebrew king, however,\nhe is making a claim for the chronological primacy of the scriptures.\nNo Platonist before him had undertaken a sustained allegorical reading\nof any text, as Porphyry confessed when he inaccurately charged him\nwith forcing Stoic techniques of exegesis on a barbarous text\n(Eusebius, Church History 6.19). Commenting line by line on a\nsacred text was not, so far as our evidence goes, a typical enterprise\nfor a Stoic. Among the Greeks the commentator who most resembles\nOrigen is Alexander of Aphrodisias; his concern, however, is to smooth\nthe surface of Aristotle, not to dig beneath it (see further\nBendinelli 1997). Origen\u2019s true predecessor is Philo of\nAlexandria, who had teased moral and metaphysical profundities from\nthe Torah, verse by verse, in order to demonstrate that nothing taught\namong the Greeks had been concealed from the Lawgiver of the Jews (see\nfurther Dawson 1992).\n\nPhilo is called a mystic because of passages which thirstily\nanticipate the mind\u2019s bacchanalian ecstasy in the presence of\nthe ineffable. For Origen the term mystikos denotes the most\narcane sense of the scriptures, and the encounter with the Bridegroom,\n\u201cwhich no-one can understand who has not experienced it\u201d,\nis described in his Homilies on the Song of Songs (I.7 [ed.\nBaehrens 1925: 39]). Whether it is a true ecstasy or a sense of\nhermeneutic illumination (Louth 2000: 69), this transient rapture\nforeshadows the culmination of the soul\u2019s journey after death,\nwhen God will at last be all in all. In answer to the jibes of Celsus,\nOrigen asserts that, while the church teaches the resurrection of the\nbody, the \u201cspiritual body\u201d of which Paul speaks will be of\na rarer and hence more durable texture than the gross flesh which now\nensheathes the soul (Cels. 5.18\u20135.23). In a dialogue\nwhich now survives only in excerpts, the soul is said to retain the\neidos, or form, of the body, perhaps a counterpart to the\ntenuous vehicle which the soul carries into the afterlife in the\neschatology of some Platonists (Methodius, On the\nResurrection 22 [ed. Bonwetsch 1899: 93]; see further Schibli\n1992). Most souls, having failed to purge their sins in this life,\nwill be required to pass the flaming sword that bars the entrance to\nthe earthly paradise (see further Crouzel 1972). Once its cleansing\nthere is complete, the soul will pass through the seven planetary\nspheres, acquiring a more comprehensive knowledge of the cosmos and\nour place in it than is vouchsafed to us in this world\n(Princ. 1.11.6). Once again, kindred notions can be found in\nPlatonic and Hermetic literature; the posthumous itinerary mirrors the\ntransition from the ethical to the sapiential teachings of Solomon,\nand we see here in an inchoate form the purgative and illuminative\nways of the western mystical tradition. A body of some kind is\npresupposed by this celestial topography; nevertheless, at the point\nwhere God becomes all in all, we hear nothing of a body, but only that\nsoul will be entirely subsumed in spirit. Some scholars hold that a\nbody must be either retained or imparted to us, since only the persons\nof the Trinity can subsist without one (e.g., Crouzel 1980); others,\ninvoking the maxim that the end will be like the beginning, argue that\nwe shall return to the incorporeal state in which we were first\ncreated (e.g., Scott 2012, with further discussion of this intricate\ntopic in Blosser 2012 and Rankin 2017). If that is so, the final state\nmust lie beyond the paradise of the saints, of which Origen says in\nthe plainest terms that the church does not hold it to be incorporeal\n(First Principles 2.36; cf. Edwards 2021). In any case, this union\nwith God appears to correspond to the last stage in the perusal of the\nSolomonic canon, and to the \u201cunitive way\u201d of the mystic in\nlater Christian literature. \n\nThis purgatory after death is not confined to those who have died at\npeace with God; if any should fail to be saved, it is not because the\nopportunity to repent has been withdrawn, but because the soul has\nbecome so brutish that it is incapable of amendment (Princ.\n1.5.5). This is the only truth that Origen thinks can be ascribed to\nPlato\u2019s doctrine of transmigration into beasts (Princ.\n3.4.3), and it cannot be presumed that even the demons will remain\nobdurate for ever. Commenting on Paul\u2019s promise that \u201cthe\nlast enemy, death\u201d will be vanquished, Origen surmises that\ndeath will not be annihilated but will cease to molest the saints\n(Princ. 3.6.5). It is generally assumed that the proper\nsubject of this passage is the devil, and the word diabolus\ndoes indeed occur in a ninth-century quotation (Eriugena, Periphyseon,\nPatrologia Latina 122, 930C). On the other hand, in a letter\nto his friends in Alexandria, Origen is said to have exclaimed that\nonly a lunatic would prophesy the salvation of the devil (Crouzel\n1973). Perhaps he means only that Satan is not destined for beatitude;\nthis need not preclude his release from torment on the last after his\npeaceful acquiescence in the victory of God (see Edwards 2010).\n7. Conclusion\n\nBy convention Origen is a \u201cChristian Platonist of\nAlexandria\u201d. In fact, his native city was only intermittently\nhis place of residence; on the other hand, his intellectual home\nthroughout his life was one in which Plato was never his compatriot\nbut an honoured guest. There is no doubt that he knew the works of the\ngreat Athenian intimately, and credited him at times with more than a\nsuperficial grasp of the highest truths. Nevertheless, no Greek\nphilosopher possessed for him the authority that he accorded to the\nscriptures; Plato was only the most prominent of the dead pagans who\nassisted him in the exegesis and harmonisation of this infallible\ntext. The work in which Origen makes most frequent reference to Plato,\nhis reply to Celsus, as noted above, is also the one in which he\nasserts that Christ takes flesh in the written word, disclosing\nmysteries that no human intellect has fathomed without revelation\n(Cels. 4.15). He was never troubled, as a mediaeval schoolman\nmight be, by a conflict between ecclesiastical dogma and the best\nthought of the ancients, because the Word who taught the ancients from\nafar is, for him, the daily shepherd of the Church.\n",
