    "main_text": "\n\nPolitical philosophy has witnessed a recent surge of interest in\nterritorial rights\u2014what they are, who holds them, what justifies\nthem\u2014as well as in a broader theory of territorial justice,\nwhich situates said rights in an account of distributive justice,\nthereby addressing the scope of the rights. This interest is hardly\nsurprising. The state is not simply a membership organization: it\nexercises authority over a geographical domain and this naturally\ngives rise to questions about how state authority over place can be\njustified, and how different claims to this authority can be assessed\nfairly. Moreover, many of the most pressing questions facing the\ncontemporary interstate order are connected to\nterritory\u2014questions such as how to resolve disputes where more\nthan one state makes claims to the same territory, how to draw\nboundaries in the case of secession or when borders are contested.\nIndeed, many of the major issues of the day\u2014such as migration,\nresources and self-defense\u2014have important territorial\ndimensions, so that a complete normative understanding of these issues\nrequires a normative theory of territory. \n\nWhat is perhaps more surprising is that territory has been relatively\nneglected. Until recently, most debates in political philosophy have\nfocused on the rights and duties of citizens toward the state, and\nvice versa, but relatively little was written about how to justify, or\nconceptualize, the territory of the state. This neglect was not\nconfined to political philosophy: it was a feature of all three\ntraditions that were influential in thinking about the state. In\ninternational law, the territorial dimension of the state was taken\nfor granted. The 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties\nof States defines states as territorial entities, which\nsuggests that the first order of business is to explain, theorize and\njustify states and that the territory of the state can be simply\nassumed. This assumption was also made by political scientists,\nwriting in both the comparative politics and international relations\ntraditions. They offered explanatory and descriptive theories of the\nstate but paid scant attention to the spatial element, largely\nassuming that the territory of the state is the product of history and\npast coercion which can be taken for granted as a basic feature of the\nstate. One might have thought that normative political philosophers\nwould be more interested in the question of how political authority\ncan be wielded over territories and not just not over persons.\nHowever, political philosophers were also guilty of this blind spot,\nin part perhaps because of the extraordinary influence of Rawls in\ncontemporary political philosophy. Rawls\u2019s task in A Theory\nof Justice was to theorize the domestic justice of the basic\nstructure of the state, and he therefore assumed, arguendo,\nthat \u201cpolitical society is closed\u201d (Rawls 1971: 4), by\nwhich he meant that we should conceive of it in the first instance as\na self-sufficient entity that we happen to be in and cannot leave. He\nthen tackled the question of the legitimacy of the state\nvis-\u00e0-vis the international order at a later stage of the\nanalysis (Rawls 1999). The closed society assumption obscured many\nimportant issues from view, and has meant that political philosophers\nwho adopt this methodological strategy have nothing to say in a range\nof cases that are very important for resolving questions of importance\nto inter-state peace and stability, as discussed above.\n",
