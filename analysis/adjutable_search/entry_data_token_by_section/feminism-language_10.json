    "main_text": "Positive research programmes in philosophy of language || Feminism and Speech Act Theory\n2.1 Feminism and Speech Act Theory\n\nThe first substantial analytic research programme in feminist\nphilosophy of language began with Rae Langton\u2019s and\nHornsby\u2019s use of speech act theory to make sense of Catharine\nMacKinnon\u2019s suggestion that pornography silences and\nsubordinates women. It has now, however, evolved well beyond those\nbeginnings. To give some flavour of this initial work, we\nbriefly summarise Langton\u2019s discussion of silencing.\n\nAccording to Langton (1993), pornography helps to bring about rape by\nperlocutionarily and illocutionarily silencing women. Following\nAustin, Langton distinguishes between locutionary, illocutionary, and\nperlocutionary acts. A locutionary act is, roughly, the act of\nuttering words that have particular meanings; a perlocutionary act is,\nroughly, the act of uttering words that have a particular effect; and\nan illocutionary act is the act done in uttering the words. Consider,\nfor example, Jennifer Saul\u2019s utterance one day of the sentence\n\u2018I pledge my allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and all her\nheirs\u2019. The locutionary act she performed was simply the\nutterance of a sentence with a particular meaning. This act had many\nperlocutionary effects: it made it possible for her to get a British\npassport, it made her feel slightly disturbed at having expressed such\nmonarchist sentiments, and it made her wonder whether a republic,\nshould it succeed the Queen, would count as an heir. The illocutionary\nact she performed was that of becoming a British citizen.\n\nLangton proposes that there are forms of silencing corresponding to\neach of these sorts of speech act. A person is locutionarily silenced\nif she is prevented from speaking, or intimidated into not speaking. A\nperson is illocutionarily silenced if she is unable to carry out the\nacts that she intends to carry out in speaking. A person is\nperlocutionarily silenced when her speech cannot have its intended\neffects. Langton is particularly concerned with the role that\nperlocutionary and illocutionary silencing may play in rape. A\nwoman\u2019s refusal to have sex is perlocutionarily silenced\nif\u2014even though she is recognized as refusing\u2014she is forced\nto have sex. Her (attempted) refusal to have sex is illocutionarily\nsilenced if it is not even recognized as a refusal. (For an\nexploration of the role of conventions in this illocutionary\nsilencing, see Wyatt 2009.) In such a case, according to Langton, it\nisn\u2019t a refusal. She suggests that pornography plays a\nkey role in making men less able to recognise women\u2019s refusals\nas refusals and more willing to rape women even when they recognise\nwomen\u2019s refusals. This means, she argues, that pornography\nillocutionarily and perlocutionarily silences women. And this\nsilencing is an important one, as it results in rape.\n\nThis example can also help us to see that some elements of\nindividualism may be indispensable to feminism (for more arguments to\nthis effect, see Antony 1995). Assuming that Langton\u2019s arguments\nare sound, we can see an important role for individualistic philosophy\nof language in feminism. Although it is right that focusing\nexclusively on individual speakers\u2019 intentions would prevent us\nfrom seeing some important facts (as Hornsby 2000 argues), it also\nvital to recognise the importance of paying some attention to an\nindividual speaker\u2019s intentions. In order to understand what has\ngone wrong in the illocutionary silencing described above, one needs\nto understand that the woman intended to be refusing sex. In\norder to understand what has gone wrong in the perlocutionary\nsilencing example, one needs to understand that the woman\nintended her refusal to bring it about that she did not have\nsex. More generally, not being understood properly is an important\nelement of life in a subordinate position, as many feminists have\nnoted. In order to make sense of not being understood properly, one\nneeds to attend to what the speaker intended and how the\naudience understood the speaker, and how these things differ. To\ndo this, one needs to look at individual states of mind.\n\nThese discussions have inspired a now substantial literature. Below, we\ngive some very non-comprehensive pointers to this literature.\n\nSome critics (e.g., Dworkin 1991, 1993; Jacobson 1995) have argued\nthat any silencing which may result from pornography is not of the\nsort that free speech law should attempt to protect. (Responses to\nthese criticisms can be found in Hornsby and Langton 1998; Langton\n2009a; and West 2003.)\nOthers, such as Leslie Green (1998), have argued that pornography\ndoes not have the sort of authority needed to carry out acts of\nsubordination and silencing. Langton (2009b) has responded to this\ncriticism; and Mary Kate McGowan (2003) has argued that the sort of\nauthority needed for the acts in question is really quite a modest and\nordinary sort of conversational authority. Nellie Wieland (2007), like\nMcGowan, thinks that there is no need for the sort of authority that\nworries Green. However, she argues that Langton\u2019s account runs\nthe risk of absolving rapists from culpability for their crimes.\n(Jacobson 1995 also raises this culpability worry.) McGowan and Maitra\n(2010) have responded to\nthis, as do McGowan, Adelman, Helmers, and Stolzenberg (2010).\nJennifer Saul (2006a) worries about Langton\u2019s claim that\npornography itself is a speech act, arguing that only utterances in\ncontexts can be speech acts. Moreover, she suggests that if\nLangton\u2019s claim is revised to be one about acts of viewing or\nshowing pornography it loses its plausibility. Claudia Bianchi (2008)\ncriticizes this, and Mari Mikkola (2008) responds.\nA further concern about context comes from Tirrell (1999). Tirrell\nargues that MacKinnon assigns pornography an authority so strong that\nwomen would be unable to successfully articulate their own\nexperiences. She suggests that MacKinnon\u2019s picture needs\nrevising to make room for the successful communication that takes\nplace between feminists.\nAlexander Bird (2002), Daniel Jacobson (1995) and Ishani Maitra\n(2009) all raise worries about the Austinian distinction between\nillocution and perlocution and its role in the silencing argument (in\nparticular, about the requirement that illocutions must be understood\nto be successful). For Bird and Jacobson this leads to a rejection of\nthe silencing argument, but Maitra instead re-frames it in Gricean\nterms. Angela Gr\u00fcnberg (2014) argues that the silencing argument\nshould be reconceived to focus not on illocutionary silencing, but on\nlocutionary or rhetic silencing. She suggests that this allows a\nsatisfying response to criticisms like those from Bird and Jacobson.\nMikkola (2011a) also defends Langton-Hornsby against Bird and\nJacobson.\nJudith Butler (1997) objects to the silencing argument on several\ngrounds, chief among them (a) that it assumes an implausible picture\nof language use; and (b) that silencing does not matter in the way\nthat Langton and Hornsby think that it does. Langton (2009c) has\nresponded to this worry.\nAlex Davies (2016) argues that pornography may not just alter the\nillocutionary force of women\u2019s utterances, but also block her\nfrom making utterances with the content that she desires. Davies\u2019s\ncentral example is the way that rape myths, perpetuated by\npornography, may make it impossible for women in courtroom cross\nexaminations to express the truth about their experiences. \n\n\nThis use of speech act theory was one of the first developments of\nfeminist philosophy of language to gain mainstream currency, and it\nhas become widely taught and studied. Recently, however, sharply\ncritical feminist voices have started to emerge. Separately, and for\ndifferent reasons, Nancy Bauer (2015) and Lorna Finlayson (2014), have\nboth argued that the feminist literature on speech acts and\npornography is deeply misguided. Bauer objects on several grounds. She\nthinks it is misguided to treat pornography as speech, and she (like\nother critics noted above) argues that pornography should not be seen\nas authoritative. Her more fundamental critique, though, is that this\nliterature fails to take seriously the realities of both pornography\nand women\u2019s subordination\u2014by not engaging sufficiently\nwith the phenomenology of pornography use; by not attending to all the\nways that the broader culture is involved in subordinating women; and\nby focusing on just women\u2019s verbal acts of refusal, thereby\nfailing to appreciate the fuller dehumanization involved in sexual\nassault. This is part of a broader critique, for Bauer, of both\nanalytic philosophy in general, and widespread understandings of\nAustin. Finlayson goes even further, arguing not that Austin\u2019s\nwork was misused by feminists but that it never should have been used\nat all. She suggests that the feminist foray into speech act theory\nwas entirely unnecessary, and also that the focus on pornography was\nmisguided.\n\nBut there have also been very substantial developments broadening and\nbuilding upon the feminist use of speech theory\u2014extending it to\nissues like racist speech, and hate speech more generally. McGowan\n(2009a) argues for the existence of a different sort of silencing due\nto pornography; and in her 2009b she argues that speech may be counted\nnot just as silencing or subordinating, but also as oppressing.\nMoreover, she suggests that oppressive speech is likely to be a very\nwidespread phenomenon. These ideas are developed further in McGowan\n(2012), which takes as its focus racist speech, and in Simpson (2013).\nMaitra (2012) also applies ideas from feminist work on subordinating\nspeech to racist speech. Langton also turns her attention to hate\nspeech more broadly, including in her 2012. This paper is also notable\nfor its focus on the role of pragmatics in shaping attitudes other\nthan belief. Rachel McKinney (2016), \u201cExtracted Speech\u201d,\nbuilds on this literature by exploring the ways that speech may be\nunjustly extracted rather than silenced (as in, for example, the\nparadigm case of the Central Park Five\u2019s false confessions).\nRebecca Kukla introduces the notion of discursive injustice, in order\nto discuss a broader range of ways that \u201cmembers of a\ndisadvantaged group face a systematic inability to produce a specific\nkind of speech act they are entitled to perform\u201d (2014: 440),\nwhich often takes the form of performing a different speech act from\nthe one that they intend. Although she draws on Langton and Hornsby,\nshe abandons their focus on illocution and perlocution, focussing\ninstead simply on performative force. Also considering the role of\npragmatics in politics (though developed independently from Langton\nand Hornsby), Marina Sbis\u00e0 (1999) explores the role of\npresuppositions in political persuasion. Finally, Jason Stanley (2015)\ndraws heavily on Langton and Hornsby\u2019s work in developing his\naccount of propaganda (focused, but not exclusively, on racist\npropaganda).\n",
