    "main_text": "Preliminaries to interpretation\n3. Preliminaries to interpretation\n\nAny effort to come to grips with Epictetus\u2019s thought must\nproceed from an awareness of his chosen objectives. The philosopher we\nmeet in the Discourses seeks above all to foster ethical\ndevelopment in others, keeping his personal intellectual satisfaction\nstrictly subordinate. Consequently we possess no point-by-point\nexposition of his views. The themes he regards as most difficult for\nstudents to internalize appear repeatedly and are developed and\nexpanded in many different ways. Other issues he either treats\nsporadically\u2014even if passing references suggest he has knowledge\nof them\u2014or omits altogether, if he regards them as inessential\nto moral development. His apparent inclination to hold back some of\nhis thinking, as well as the incomplete condition in which the\nDiscourses have been transmitted to us, make it quite unsafe\nto draw any assumption about his views from silences or gaps in the\naccount we have. On the other hand, the recursive manner of\npresentation makes it unlikely that the non-extant volumes broached\nany entirely new themes.\n\nInterpreters must be careful not to prejudge the question of\nEpictetus\u2019s relation to earlier Greek philosophy. While it is\nevident that his principal contentions are substantially related to\nearlier philosophical developments, claims concerning his relation to\nthe earlier Stoics, or possible philosophical innovations or shifts of\nemphasis, must be governed by a healthy respect for the fragmentary\nnature of our sources. We possess no comparable record of the oral\nteaching that took place in the Hellenistic Stoa. Where corroborating\nevidence exists in literary or doxographical works, we are justified\nin describing his views as reformulations of the Stoic tradition;\notherwise the question of continuity should generally be left\nopen.\n",
