    "main_text": "Contemporary Compatibilism || Reasons-Responsive Compatibilism\n4.4 Reasons-Responsive Compatibilism\n\nSeveral compatibilists have suggested that freely willed actions issue\nfrom volitional features of agency that are sensitive to an\nappropriate range of reasons (see Dennett 1984a; Fingarette 1972;\nGert & Duggan 1979; Glover 1970; MacIntyre 1957; Neely 1974; and\nNozick 1981). Agents who are unresponsive to appropriate rational\nconsiderations (such as compulsives or neurotics) do not act of their\nown free wills. But agents who are responsive to some range\nof rational considerations do. This view has been artfully refined in\nrecent years by Fischer (1987,  1994), and\nsubsequently, Fischer and Ravizza (1998). (For a more advanced\ndiscussion of Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s view, which many regard as\nthe gold standard for contemporary compatibilism, see section B of the\nsupplement\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art.)\n \n\nA reasons-responsiveness theory turns upon dispositional\nfeatures of an agent\u2019s relation to reasons issuing in freely\nwilled action. Appropriately reasons-responsive conduct is sensitive\nto rational considerations. Importantly, the view is not merely that\nan agent would display herself in some counterfactual situations to be\nresponsive to reasons, but rather that her responsiveness to reasons\nin some counterfactual situations is evidence that her actual conduct\nitself \u2014 the causes giving rise to it \u2014\nis also in response to rational considerations. (Amendments need to be\nadded to accommodate cases of spur-of-the-moment, or impulsive freely\nwilled action.)\n4.4.1 Agent-Based Reasons-Responsiveness\n\nThe most natural way to understand a reasons-responsive theory is in\nterms of an agent\u2019s responsiveness to reasons. To\nillustrate, suppose that Frank Zappa plays the banjo of his own free\nwill. According to a reasons-responsive theory, his playing the banjo\nfreely at that time requires that if, in at least some hypothetical\ncases, he had reason not to, then he would refrain from playing the\nbanjo. For instance, if Jimi Hendrix were to have stepped into\nFrank\u2019s recording studio and asked Frank to play his electric\nguitar, Frank would have wanted to make Jimi happy and thus would have\ngladly put his banjo aside and picked up his electric guitar. It\nseems, then, that for Frank to play the banjo of his own free will,\nFrank \u2014 the agent \u2014 must have regulative control\nand not merely guidance control over his playing. His freedom must\nconsist partially in his ability to act upon alternatives.\n4.4.2 A Tension between Reasons-Responsiveness and Frankfurt Examples\n\nNotice that, because Frankfurt examples challenge the\nincompatibilists\u2019 demand for regulative control, they also\nchallenge an agent-based reasons-responsive theory (Fischer\n& Ravizza 1998, pp. 34\u201341). Imagine that the benevolent demon\nJerry Garcia wants Frank to play the banjo at the relevant time. Jerry\nwould much prefer that Frank play the banjo on his own. But worried\nthat Frank might elect not to play the banjo, Jerry covertly arranges\nthings so as to manipulate Frank if the need arises. If Frank should\nshow any indication that he will not play the banjo, Jerry will\nmanipulate Frank so that Frank will play the banjo. Hence, when Frank\ndoes play the banjo uninfluenced by Jerry\u2019s possible\nintervention, he does so of his own free will. But he has neither\nregulative control, nor does he seem to be reasons-responsive, with\nrespect to his banjo playing. Due to Jerry\u2019s presence, he cannot\nbut play the banjo even if Jimi Hendrix were to ask Frank to play\nhis guitar.\n\nTo alleviate the tension between a reasons-responsive theory and\nFrankfurt examples, Fischer argued that reasons-responsive\ncompatibilism can be cast in such a way that it involves only guidance\ncontrol. Consider the example with Frank, Jimi, and Jerry. Frank did\nnot have regulative control over his playing the banjo since\nJerry\u2019s presence ensured that Frank play the banjo even if Jimi\nwere to ask Frank to play his guitar. The scenario in which Jimi asks\nFrank not to play his banjo is one that Frank normally would\nfind to be a compelling reason to refrain from his banjo playing.\nHence, by his own lights, Frank would find\nJimi\u2019s request compelling. Yet, due to Jerry\u2019s presence,\nFrank is not responsive to such a weighty reason. What would\nbe required to illustrate responsiveness would be to subtract Jerry\nfrom the scenario. This would do the trick. So suppose that Frank\nplays the banjo of his own free will, even with Jerry passively\nstanding by. How can it be shown that Frank\u2019s conduct was, in\nsome manner, reasons-responsive? How can it be shown that what he\nactually did was in response to a reason? Well, if Jimi\nHendrix had asked Frank not to play the banjo but the guitar instead,\nand if Jerry\u2019s presence were to be subtracted from the\nsituation, then Frank would respond to Jimi\u2019s request\nand play the guitar and not the banjo. This suggests that Frank does\nplay the banjo of his own free will even in the actual situation in\nwhich Jerry is passively standing by.\n4.4.3 A Mechanism-Based Reasons-Responsive Theory\n\nIllustrating reasons-responsiveness in a Frankfurt example seems to\nrequire recognizing counterfactual conditions in which an agent acts\notherwise in response to reasons. But in a Frankfurt example, one has\nto subtract from those conditions the presence of the ensuring\nconditions (the counterfactual intervener) designed to guarantee that\nthe agent not act otherwise. How can this move be legitimate? How is\nit not just an arbitrary addendum to cram together two compatibilist\nthemes that otherwise appear to be at odds (reasons-responsiveness and\nFrankfurt examples)? It is not arbitrary, and here is why. Think about\nwhat happens in the actual scenario of a Frankfurt example. As things\nunfold, the demon is inactive. The agent acts for her own\nreasons. But now, focusing solely on what the agent does in\nthis actual scenario, and the reasons that give her a basis for doing\nwhat she does, consider what deliberative features of her agency\nplayed the causal role in the actual sequence of events\nbringing about her action. So, just fix upon whatever constitutes that\nnarrower range of agential characteristics within the wider spectrum\nof all of the features that made up Frank Zappa, the agent. Since it\nis only that narrower spectrum that we propose to identify with the\ncausal production of Frank\u2019s conduct, just call it the\nmechanism that produces his action.\n\nOnce we have located the mechanism of action that is at work in the\nactual causal sequence of a Frankfurt example, we can turn our\nattention to understanding the dispositional features of it\nas a causal mechanism. If other reasons bear upon it, then it\nwould be sensitive to some of those reasons. It would produce\ndifferent conduct in some reasonable range of cases. If it would,\nthen that very mechanism is responsive to reasons. Confirming\nthat that very mechanism is responsive to reasons would not merely\nillustrate that, in scenarios other than the actual, the agent acts\nupon a mechanism sensitive to reasons. It would also illustrate that\nin the Frankfurt scenario in which the agent really does act,\nwhat does play a role in the actual causal sequence of her\naction is some feature of her agency (a mechanism) that\nitself is in fact a response to a reason.\n\nFischer offers an actual-sequence, mechanism-based,\nreasons-responsive analysis of guidance control. He maintains\nthat his analysis of guidance control is compatible with determinism.\nAccording to Fischer, an agent, and the mechanism of her action, can\nbe entirely determined in the actual sequence of events in which she\nacts. Yet the actual manner in which her mechanism responds to reasons\ncould be appropriately sensitive to reasons such that, if different\nreasons were to bear upon it, it would respond differently, and the\nagent whose mechanism it is would act differently than she does\nact.\n\nRecently, however, Carolina Sartorio (2016) has argued that\nactual-sequence compatibilist do not need to appeal to mechanisms in\norder to vindicate their theories. According to Sartorio, we can\nexplain Frank\u2019s responsibility by appeal to the actual causes of\nhis behavior, which are, she claims, much richer than has previously\nbeen realized. Not only is his behavior caused by his sensitive to\nreasons there are, on Sartorio\u2019s view, it is also caused by\nthe absence of other reasons (in this case, e.g., the absence\nof Jimi\u2019s request is itself a cause in the actual-sequence).\n\n4.4.4 Assessing Reasons-Responsive Compatibilism\n\nFischer\u2019s reasons-responsiveness compatibilist starts by\nrejecting the key premise of the Classical Incompatibilist Argument,\nin that it rejects the thesis that freedom of the sort required for\nmoral responsibility requires the ability to do otherwise. But how\ndoes Fischer\u2019s view stack up against the Source Incompatibilist\nArgument? The challenge Fischer faces here, which is pushed forcefully\nby Pereboom (2001) and Mele (2019), is the same as that faced by\nFrankfurt and Wolf. The source incompatibilist maintains that it is a\nnecessary condition of free will that one be an ultimate source of her\naction, and determinism is incompatible with one\u2019s being an\nultimate source of her action. The compatibilist\u2019s task is to\nshow that her treatment of the source of an agent\u2019s conduct is\nsufficient for free will. But the source incompatibilist will point to\nmanipulation cases that suggest that some causal histories giving rise\nto compatibilist-friendly psychological structures, such as\nreasons-responsive mechanisms, are freedom and responsibility\nundermining. If so, then why is determinism any different from a\nmanipulation case? The burden, it seems, is on the compatibilist to\nshow how it is that manipulation cases differ from a normal\ndeterministic history. The compatibilist\u2019s only other strategy\nis simply to deny that the pertinent manipulated agents are not free\nand morally responsible. This problem is not lost on\nreasons-responsiveness compatibilists, of course (see Fischer 2004 for\none attempt to address these issues).\n",
