    "main_text": "Current issues in fallacy theory || The appearance condition\n4.2 The appearance condition\n\nFrom Aristotle to Mill the appearance condition was an essential part\nof the conception of fallacies. However, some of the new,\npost-Hamblin, scholars have either ignored it (Finocchiaro, Biro and\nSiegel) or rejected it because appearances can vary from person to\nperson, thus making the same argument a fallacy for the one who is\ntaken in by the appearance, and not a fallacy for the one who sees\npast the appearances. This is unsatisfactory for those who think that\narguments are either fallacies or not. Appearances, it is also argued,\nhave no place in logical or scientific theories because they belong to\npsychology (van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004). But Walton (e.g.,\n2010) continues to consider appearances an essential part of fallacies\nas does Powers (1995, 300) who insists that fallacies must \u201chave\nan appearance, however quickly seen through, of being valid.\u201d If\nthe mistake in an argument is not masked by an ambiguity that makes it\nappear to be a better argument than it really is, Powers denies it is\na fallacy.\n\nThe appearance condition of fallacies serves at least two purposes.\nFirst, it can be part of explanations of why reasonable people make\nmistakes in arguments or argumentation: it may be due in part to an\nargument\u2019s appearing to be better than it really is. Second, it\nserves to divide mistakes into two groups: those which are trivial or\nthe result of carelessness (for which there is no cure other than\npaying better attention), and those which we need to learn to detect\nthrough an increased awareness of their seductive nature. Without the\nappearance condition, it can be argued, no division can be made\nbetween these two kinds of errors: either there are no fallacies or\nall mistakes in argument and/or argumentation are fallacies; a\nconclusion that some are willing to accept, but which runs contrary to\ntradition. One can also respond that there is an alternative to using\nthe appearance condition as the demarcation property between fallacies\nand casual mistakes, namely, frequency. Fallacies are those mistakes\nwe must learn to guard against because they occur with noticeable\nfrequency. To this it may be answered that \u2018noticeable\nfrequency\u2019 is vague, and is perhaps best explained by the\nappearance condition.\n",
