The Difference Principle\n\nThe wealth of an economy is not a fixed amount from one period to the\nnext, but can be influenced by many factors relevant to economic\ngrowth. These include, for example, technological advancement or\nchanges in policy that affect how much people are able to produce with\ntheir labour and resources. More wealth can be produced and indeed\nthis has been the overwhelming feature of industrialized countries\nover the last couple of centuries. The dominant economic view is that\nwealth is most readily increased in systems where those who are more\nproductive earn greater incomes. This economic view partly inspired\nthe formulation of the Difference Principle. \n\nThe most widely discussed theory of distributive justice in the past\nfour decades has been that proposed by John Rawls in A Theory of\nJustice, (Rawls 1971), and Political Liberalism, (Rawls\n1993). Rawls proposes the following two principles of justice:\n\n\n1. Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal\nbasic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same\nscheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and\nonly those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value. \n\n2. Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: (a)\nThey are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under\nconditions of fair equality of opportunity; and (b), they are to be to\nthe greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.\n(Rawls 1993, pp. 5\u20136. The principles are numbered as they were\nin Rawls\u2019 original A Theory of Justice.)\n\n\nWhere the rules may conflict in practice, Rawls says that Principle\n(1) has lexical priority over Principle (2), and Principle (2a) has\nlexical priority over (2b). As a consequence of the priority rules,\nRawls\u2019 principles do not permit sacrifices to basic liberties in\norder to generate greater equality of opportunity or a higher level of\nmaterial goods, even for the worst off. While it is possible to think\nof Principle (1) as governing the distribution of liberties, it is not\ncommonly considered a principle of distributive justice given that it\nis not governing the distribution of economic goods per se.\nEquality of opportunity is discussed in the next section. In this\nsection, the primary focus will be on (2b), known as the Difference\nPrinciple. \n\nThe main moral motivation for the Difference Principle is similar to\nthat for strict equality: equal respect for persons. Indeed, since the\nonly material inequalities the Difference Principle permits are those\nthat raise the level of the least advantaged in the society, it\nmaterially collapses to a form of strict equality under empirical\nconditions where differences in income have no effect on the work\nincentive of people (and hence, no tendency to increase growth). The\noverwhelming economic opinion though is that in the foreseeable future\nthe possibility of earning greater income will bring forth greater\nproductive effort. This will increase the total wealth of the economy\nand, under the Difference Principle, the wealth of the least\nadvantaged. Opinion divides on the size of the inequalities which\nwould, as a matter of empirical fact, be allowed by the Difference\nPrinciple, and on how much better off the least advantaged would be\nunder the Difference Principle than under a strict equality principle.\nRawls\u2019 principle, however, gives fairly clear guidance on what\ntype of arguments will count as justifications for inequality. Rawls\nis not opposed in principle to a system of strict equality per\nse; his concern is about the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged group rather than their relative position.\nIf a system of strict equality maximizes the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged in society, then the Difference Principle advocates\nstrict equality. If it is possible to raise the absolute position of\nthe least advantaged further by having some inequalities of income and\nwealth, then the Difference Principle prescribes inequality up to that\npoint where the absolute position of the least advantaged can no\nlonger be raised.\n\nBecause there has been such extensive discussion of the Difference\nPrinciple in the last 40 years, there have been numerous criticisms of\nit from the perspectives of all the other theories of distributive\njustice outlined here. Briefly, the main criticisms are as\nfollows.\n\nAdvocates of strict equality argue that inequalities permitted by the\nDifference Principle are unacceptable even if they do benefit the\nabsolute position of the least advantaged. The problem for these\nadvocates has been to explain convincingly why society should be\nprevented from materially benefiting the least advantaged when this\nbenefit requires a deviation from strict equality.\n\nFor the strict egalitarian the relative position of people is\nall important and the absolute position is either not\nimportant at all or lexically inferior. For Rawls, at least with\nrespect to the social and economic inequalities, the opposite is true.\nBut there have been various plausible explanations given in reply to\nRawls\u2019 proposed Difference Principle why relative position is a\nvalue that should be weighed against the value of the\nabsolute position of the least advantaged rather than subordinated\nlexically to it. In an early reply to Rawls, Crocker explains the\nvalue of paying attention to the relative position as a way of\nunderstanding the value of solidarity. His approach fits into a set of\nviews in which being materially equal, or striving towards it, is an\nimportant expression of the equality of persons. G.A. Cohen (1992)\nalso provides a critique of Rawls\u2019 Difference Principle that is\ninspired by what he calls an \u201cegalitarian ethos\u201d. Cohen\naccepts greater income for some where this raises the level of the\nleast well off, and acts as compensation for work that involves\nspecial burdens, such as being particularly unpleasant or dangerous.\nIn such cases, the income differences actually have an\n\u201cequalizing\u201d effect. However, Cohen rejects applications\nof the Difference Principle in the context of greater incomes to\ninduce those who are particularly talented to undertake work which\nwill benefit the least advantaged, particularly when that work, as is\noften the case, is already more fulfilling than other employment\noptions. His justification is that such incentives are not strictly\nnecessary to improve the level of the least well off, in a Rawlsian\nwell-ordered society, where citizens would willingly accept and comply\nwith the demands of the Difference Principle. In other words, if\nlarger incomes are necessary only because the talented are taking\nadvantage of the demand for their talent to seek maximal economic\ngain, then the Difference Principle should not be interpreted as\nsanctioning them. Cohen\u2019s critique effectively urges a stricter\nreading of the requirements of the Difference Principle than Cohen\nbelieves Rawls and many of his supporters have held.\n\n\nAnother set of views, in opposition to Rawls\u2019 Difference\nPrinciple, emphasizes the importance of relative position not as a\nvalue in itself but because of its effect on other relations. In\nparticular, if some people are significantly better off materially\nthan others then that can result in them having significant power over\nothers. Rawls\u2019 response to this criticism appeals to the lexical\npriority of his first principle: The inequalities consistent with the\nDifference Principle are only permitted so long as they do not\ncompromise the fair value of the political liberties. So, for\ninstance, very large wealth differentials may make it practically\nimpossible for poor people to be elected to political office or to\nhave their political views represented. These inequalities of wealth,\neven if they increase the material position of the least advantaged\ngroup, may need to be reduced in order for the first principle to be\nimplemented. However, while this provides a partial reply to\nRawls\u2019 critics, it does not seem to recognize that it is not\njust differential political power that can come from significant\ndifferences in economic position but also economic power and hence\neconomic freedom. Virtual monopoly employers in regions of developing\neconomies give a stark illustration of this phenomenon. Of course,\nRawls can appeal in such cases to the empirical claim that such\ndifferentials do not maximize the long-term position of the least\nadvantaged. The empirical question will be whether all such large\ndifferentials which result in large differences in economic power also\ndemonstrably have the result of worsening the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged.\n\nThe utilitarian objection to the Difference Principle is that it does\nnot maximize utility. In A Theory of Justice, Rawls uses\nutilitarianism as the main theory for comparison with his own, and\nhence he offers a number of arguments in response to this utilitarian\nobjection, some of which are outlined in the section on\n Welfare-Based Principles.\n\nLibertarians object that the Difference Principle involves\nunacceptable infringements on liberty, property rights, or\nself-ownership. For instance, the Difference Principle may require\nredistributive taxation for the benefit of the poor, and libertarians\ncommonly object that such taxation involves the immoral taking of just\nholdings (see\n Libertarian Principles).\n\nThe Difference Principle is also criticized as a primary distributive\nprinciple on the grounds that it mostly ignores claims that people\ndeserve certain economic benefits in light of their actions.\nAdvocates of desert-based principles argue that some may deserve a\nhigher level of material goods because of their hard work or\ncontributions even if their unequal rewards do not also function to\nimprove the position of the least advantaged. Desert theorists as well\nas libertarians also argue that the explanation of how people\ncome to be in more or less advantaged positions is morally relevant to\ntheir fairness, yet the Difference Principle ignores these\nexplanations.\n\nLike desert theorists, advocates of Luck Egalitarian principles argue\nthat the Difference Principle does not fully capture the moral roles\nthey believe luck and responsibility should play in principles of\ndistributive justice. Indeed, \u2018luck egalitarianism\u2019 as a\ndistinct approach in the distributive justice literature really\ndeveloped in critical response to Rawls\u2019 theory of distributive\njustice. The reasons for that response are outlined in the next\nsection.\n",
