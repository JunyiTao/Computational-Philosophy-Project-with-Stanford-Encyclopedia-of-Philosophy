    "main_text": "Applied Questions in Immigration || Irregular Migrants\n3.5 Selection Criteria\n\n\nFinally, one of the most complex and controversial issues within the\nliterature on the morality of immigration is what criteria a state may\npermissibly employ to distinguish among applicants for admission.\nCountries might use either a lottery or a first-come, first-admitted\nwaitlist, but they might also screen the applicants and give preference\nto those whose language, culture and/or skill sets make them most\nlikely to assimilate in the host state\u2019s economy and political\nculture. But what if a country\u2019s immigration policies\ndifferentiate among applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion or\ncountry of origin? What if a country flatly refused to even\nconsider applications for immigration from Asians or Africans, for\ninstance?\n\n\nAs with so many issues in this area, Walzer\u2019s (1983) treatment\nof this question is seminal. In this case, though, many have\nrecoiled at his conclusions. To see why, consider his take on\n\u201cWhite Australia,\u201d Australia\u2019s erstwhile practice of\nrecruiting immigration from England while explicitly prohibiting\nimmigration from non-European countries. Walzer writes,\n\u201cAssuming, then, that there actually is superfluous land, the\nclaim of necessity would force a political community like that of White\nAustralia to confront a radical choice. Its members could yield\nland for the sake of homogeneity, or they could give up homogeneity\n(agree to the creation of a multiracial society) for the sake of the\nland. And those would be their only two choices. White\nAustralia could survive only as Little Australia.\u201d (Walzer 1983:\n47) Walzer may well be right that Australia had a duty to share\nits vast land with those who needed it, but it is striking that he had\nno principled objection aimed specifically at Australia\u2019s\nracism. If Australia did not have so much territory, then Walzer\napparently would not object to their excluding immigrants on the basis\nof their race or ethnicity.\n\n\nA number of critics agree that Walzer\u2019s analysis is misguided,\nbut there has been no consensus as to precisely where and why it goes\noff the tracks. Consider, for instance, the conflicting accounts\noffered by David Miller, Joseph Carens and Michael Blake.\nMiller\u2019s take is interesting, because he accepts Walzer\u2019s\narguments and conclusion that political communities enjoy a general\nright to design and enforce their own immigration policies.\nUnlike Walzer, though, Miller stops short of concluding that states can\nexclude potential immigrants on whatever grounds they like. As he\nputs it,\nI have tried to hold a balance between the interest that\nmigrants have in entering the country they want to live in, and the\ninterest that political communities have in determining their\nown character. Although the first of these interests is not strong\nenough to justify a right of migration, it is still substantial, and\nso the immigrants who are refused entry are owed an explanation. To be\ntold that they belong to the wrong race, or sex (or have the wrong\ncolor) is insulting, given that these features do not connect to\nanything of real significance to the society they want to join. Even\ntennis clubs are not entitled to discriminate among applicants on\ngrounds such as these. (Miller 2014: 373\u2013374)\nMiller\u2019s analysis will be attractive to many, but some may worry\nthat it is too quick. What would we say about a white woman who\nrefused to even consider marrying someone outside of her race, for\ninstance? We might well condemn her racism as deplorable, and we\nshould not be the least bit surprised if non-whites were sorely\noffended by her attitudes, but presumably we would stop short of\nsaying that she had a duty to marry a black person. And if a white\nperson is within her rights to refuse to marry anyone who is not\nwhite, then why is a predominantly white political community not\nequally entitled to reject potential immigrants on the basis of their\nrace?\n\n\nJoseph Carens offers an answer to this question by invoking the\nstandard distinction between public and private spheres. He\nwrites, \u201cThere is a deep tension between the right of freedom of\nassociation and the right to equal treatment. One way to address\nthis tension is to say that in the private sphere freedom of\nassociation prevails and in the public sphere equal treatment\ndoes. You can pick your friends on the basis of whatever criteria\nyou wish, but in selecting people for offices you must treat all\ncandidates fairly\u2026.So, the fact that private clubs may admit or\nexclude whomever they choose says nothing about the appropriate\nadmission standards for states. When the state acts it must treat\nindividuals equally.\u201d (Carens 1987: 267\u20138) This answer is\npromising, but even if one is generally sympathetic to the\npublic/private distinction, it is not obvious that it applies to\nadmissions into a country in the same way that it applies to\ndecisions regarding those already within this state.\nThis is because, many presume that in order to be legitimate, states\nmust treat all of their constituents as free and equal, and one way to\npursue this freedom and equality is to ensure that individuals are not\nexcluded from various spheres of power and prestige on the basis of\ntheir membership in historically disadvantaged groups. But\nbecause states need not ensure that their constituents are free and\nequal to all outsiders, it does not have the same reason to protect\nagainst foreigners being excluded on the basis of characteristics that\nwould rightly be ruled out if used by public groups within the\nstate.\n\n\nFinally, Michael Blake (2003) has offered an account which promises\nto avoid all of these pitfalls. His view is striking because it\nexplains the impermissibility of excluding outsiders on the basis of\nracist criteria in terms of how it mistreats insiders. If\nAustralia refuses to allow Asians to enter the country, for instance,\nthen this is an affront to all Asian Australians who are thereby\ntreated as second class citizens. As he says, \u201cTo identify\nthe purpose of the state with the preservation of a cultural group is\ninevitably to draw an invidious distinction against those citizens who\ndo not happen to belong to that community. In all cases in which\nthere are national or ethnic minorities\u2014which is to say, the vast\nmajority of actual cases\u2014to restrict immigration for national or\nethnic reasons is to make some citizens politically inferior to\nothers\u2026. Seeking to eliminate the presence of a given group from\nyour society by selective immigration is insulting to the members of that group\nalready present.\u201d (Blake 2003: 232\u20133) Thus, Blake is able\nto explain what is objectionable about racist selection criteria by\ninvoking the requirement that states treat all of their own\nconstituents as free and equal, since these criteria clearly treat\nthose insiders in the dispreferred group as inferior and\nsubordinate.\n\n\nBlake\u2019s account has much to offer, but it has at least one\nmajor drawback: it appears unable to explain the impermissibility of a\nracially or culturally homogenous political community excluding\npotential immigrants on the basis of their race or culture. If\nAustralia had no Asian citizens, for instance, then there would be no\ninsiders who would be wronged by a policy excluding Asian immigrants,\nand thus Blake\u2019s argument would provide us with no grounds to\ncriticize it.\n",
