The Ethics of Creating Embryos for Stem Cell Research and Therapy\n\n\nMost HESCs are derived from embryos that were created for infertility\ntreatment but that were in excess of what the infertile individual(s)\nultimately needed to achieve a pregnancy. The HESCs derived from these\nleftover embryos offer investigators a powerful tool for understanding\nthe mechanisms controlling cell differentiation.  However, there are\nscientific and therapeutic reasons not to rely entirely on leftover\nembryos. From a research standpoint, creating embryos through cloning\ntechnologies with cells that are known to have particular genetic\nmutations would allow researchers to study the underpinnings of\ngenetic diseases in vitro. From a therapeutic standpoint, the\nHESCs obtained from leftover IVF embryos are not genetically diverse\nenough to address the problem of immune rejection by recipients of\nstem cell transplants.  (Induced pluripotent stem cells may ultimately\nprove sufficient for these research and therapeutic ends, since the\ncells can (a) be selected for specific genetic mutations and (b)\nprovide an exact genetic match for stem cell recipients.)  At present,\nthe best way to address the therapeutic problem is through the\ncreation of a public stem cell bank that represents a genetically\ndiverse pool of stem cell lines (Faden et al. 2003, Lott &\nSavulescu 2007). This kind of stem cell bank would require the\ncreation of embryos from gamete donors who share the same HLA-types\n(i.e., similar versions of the genes that mediate immune recognition\nand rejection).\n\n\nEach of these enterprises has its own set of ethical issues.  In the\ncase of research cloning, some raise concerns, for example, that the\nperfection of cloning techniques for research purposes will enable the\npursuit of reproductive cloning, and that efforts to obtain the\nthousands of eggs required for the production of cloned embryos will\nresult in the exploitation of women who provide the eggs (President\u2019s\nCouncil on Bioethics 2002, Norsigian 2005). With respect to stem cell\nbanks, it is not practically possible to create a bank of HESCs that\nwill provide a close immunological match for all recipients. This\ngives rise to the challenge of determining who will have biological\naccess to stem cell therapies. We might construct the bank so that it\nprovides matches for the greatest number of people in the population,\ngives everyone an equal chance of finding a match, or ensures that all\nancestral/ethnic groups are fairly represented in the bank (Faden\net al. 2003, Bok, Schill, & Faden 2004, Greene 2006).\n\n\nThere are, however, more general challenges to the creation of embryos\nfor research and therapeutic purposes. Some argue that the creation of\nembryos for non-reproductive ends is morally problematic, regardless\nof whether they are created through cloning or in vitro\nfertilization. There are two related arguments that have been advanced\nto morally distinguish the creation of embryos for reproductive\npurposes from the creation of embryos for research and therapeutic\npurposes. First, each embryo created for procreative purposes is\noriginally viewed as a potential child in the sense that each is a\ncandidate for implantation and development into a mature human. In\ncontrast, embryos created for research or therapies are viewed as mere\ntools from the outset (Annas, Caplan & Elias 1996, President\u2019s\nCouncil on Bioethics 2002). Second, while embryos created for research\nand therapy are produced with the intent to destroy them, the\ndestruction of embryos created for reproduction is a foreseeable but\nunintended consequence of their creation (FitzPatrick 2003).\n\n\nOne response to the first argument has been to suggest that we\ncould, under certain conditions, view all research embryos as potential\nchildren in the relevant sense. If all research embryos were\nincluded in a lottery in which some of them were donated to individuals\nfor reproductive purposes, all research embryos would have a chance at\ndeveloping into mature humans (Devander 2005). Since\nthose who oppose creating embryos for research would likely maintain\ntheir opposition in the research embryo lottery case, it is arguably\nirrelevant whether embryos are viewed as potential children when they\nare created. Of course, research embryos in the lottery case would be\nviewed as both potential children and potential research tools.\nBut this is also true in the case of embryos created for reproductive\npurposes where patients are open to donating spare embryos to\nresearch.\n\n\nAs to the second argument, the distinction between intending and\nmerely foreseeing harms is one to which many people attach moral\nsignificance, and it is central to the Doctrine of Double Effect.\nBut even if one holds that this is a morally significant distinction,\nit is not clear that it is felicitous to characterize the destruction\nof spare embryos as an unintended but foreseeable side-effect of\ncreating embryos for fertility treatment. Fertility clinics do\nnot merely foresee that some embryos will be destroyed, as they choose\nto offer patients the option of discarding embryos and carry out the\ndisposal of embryos when patients request it. Patients who elect\nthat their embryos be discarded also do not merely foresee the\nembryos\u2019 destruction; their election of that option manifests\ntheir intention that the embryos be destroyed. There is thus\nreason to doubt that there is a moral distinction between creating\nembryos for research and creating them for reproductive purposes, at\nleast given current fertility clinic practices.\n ",
