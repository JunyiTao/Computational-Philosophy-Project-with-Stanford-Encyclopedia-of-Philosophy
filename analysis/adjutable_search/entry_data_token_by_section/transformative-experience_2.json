    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Sense Modality and Sensory Experiences\n1.2 Sense Modality and Sensory Experiences\n\nChildren who grow up in the United States rather than Australia\ngenerally don\u2019t experience the distinctive taste of vegemite.\nPeople born with color blindness don\u2019t see certain colors.\nTasting vegemite and seeing color for the first time are radically new\nsensory experiences with distinctive phenomenal characters, and\nprobably only involve epistemic transformation. Some people experience\neven more radical changes when they gain or lose a sense modality.\nSomeone who has always been sighted or hearing cannot appreciate what\nit is like to be blind or deaf. Likewise, people who have always been\nblind or deaf cannot appreciate what it is like to be sighted or\nhearing. In addition to not knowing what gaining or losing a sense\nmodality might be like, one cannot anticipate how that gain or loss\nmight personally change them and the way they navigate the world. The\nfact that most of society is structured to accommodate sighted and\nhearing people increases the difference between a change in sense\nmodality. And of course, appreciating the transformative nature of\ngaining a sense modality carries practical implications since many\npeople are in a position to decide for themselves or others whether to\ngain a sense modality via surgical interventions.\n",
