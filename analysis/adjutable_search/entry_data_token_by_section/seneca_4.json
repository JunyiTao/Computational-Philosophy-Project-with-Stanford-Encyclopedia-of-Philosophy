    "main_text": "Philosophical Psychology || The Will and the Self\n3.2 The Will and the Self\n\nThe Stoic understanding of the soul further involves core\nepistemological ideas. Human beings have \u201cimpressions\u201d\n(imprints or alterations of the soul). We acquire the views we hold by\nassenting to impressions; in every given case, we can assent to an\nimpression, negate it, or withhold judgment. Since this is in our\npower, it is in our power to become wise (by assenting only to\ncognitive impressions, which represent things precisely as they are).\nHuman action is generated through \u201cassent\u201d to practical\nimpressions; such assent sets off impulse (horm\u00ea). If\nthere is no external impediment, impulse leads to action. It is in our\npower to become virtuous, because assent is in our control;\nwe decide how we act. Seneca discusses these and related\nissues with the help of a term that has no equivalent in Greek\nStoicism: voluntas.\n\nTraditionally, Seneca was seen either as the discoverer of the will,\nor, at least, a major stepping-stone towards St. Augustine (for\ndetailed discussion of the literature, see Inwood 2005 [5]; key\ncontributions are: I. Hadot 1969, Voelke 1973, Dihle 1982, Donini\n1982, Kahn 1988; for the view that already Aristotle has a conception\nof the will, see Irwin 1992; for a critique of the traditional view\nsee Rist 1969, and, recently, Inwood 2005 [5]; for the view that\nEpictetus, as opposed to Seneca, plays a major role in the development\nof the conception of a will, see Frede 2011.).\n\nIt is a difficult question what precisely would count as the discovery\nof the will. Clearly, voluntas and velle\n(\u2018willing\u2019, \u2018wanting\u2019) figure prominently in\nmany of Seneca\u2019s arguments. Does Seneca think there is a\nseparate faculty of the will, thus modifying psychological monism? Or\nis he interested in exploring the phenomenology of decision-making and\nself-improvement, and this leads him to describe certain mental acts\nas acts of willing (velle)? This second suggestion seems more\npersuasive, and seems to capture much of what is important to the\ntraditional interpretation: that Seneca keeps discussing how we must\nbe continually committed to self-improvement (cf. Letters\n34.3 and 71.36). Perhaps Seneca\u2019s depictions of the mental act\nthat the Greek Stoics call assent appear in some sense richer than\nthose of the earlier Stoics (without changing the substance of the\ntheory), because Seneca likes to use metaphorical language. Rather\nthan stick with the abstract description that, in deciding what to do,\nwe assent to a practical impression, Seneca envisages us as judges,\npassing judgment over what we should be doing, and issuing commands to\nourselves (cf. Inwood 2005, [5] and [7]; Star 2012, 23\u201352). With\nrespect to the emotions, Seneca distinguishes between involuntary\nreactions (what earlier Stoics call \u201cproto-emotions\u201d or\npropatheiai) and full-blown emotions, which involve assent\nand thus are voluntary (On Anger II; see below). They are\nvoluntary in the sense that assent is in the agent\u2019s power. This\nis a key piece of Stoic doctrine\u2014that, whether we are foolish or\nwise, it is in our power to assent or not assent to impressions. But\nat other times, Seneca employs a normative notion of voluntariness.\nOnly virtuous action is free in the sense of being fully reasonable,\nwhile other actions spring from irrational movements of the mind such\nas emotions; in this sense, only virtuous action is voluntary\n(Letter 66.16).\n\nSeneca\u2019s discussions of self-improvement raise a further\nquestion: Does Seneca discover the self (or, as Veyne puts this\nquestion, \u201cthe I\u201d; Veyne 2003)? In a famous passage of\nOn Anger (III 36.3\u20134) Seneca tells his readers how he,\nevery evening, examines himself. Does Seneca\u2019s emphasis on\nreflection involve a turn to the self, as it has seemed to many recent\nreaders inspired by Foucault\u2019s discussions of these matters? Is\nSeneca concerned with a practice of self-shaping? In order to think\nabout the question of whether Seneca discovers or even invents the\nself, we might distinguish different versions of it. First, we may ask\nwhether Seneca modifies psychological monism, so as to make room for a\nself reflecting upon itself (in a way which makes the self have a\ncomplex structure that the Greek Stoics would not have envisaged for\nthe rational soul of human beings). Second, we might think that what\nreaders, in the wake of Foucault\u2019s influential studies, have\nfound modern about Seneca is simply his therapeutic concern with\nfashioning one\u2019s own life. This second view is much weaker, and\nis by now widely accepted (Long 2006, 362). The first view is\nforcefully critiqued by Inwood (2005 [12]; cf. Bartsch and Wray 2009).\nWhile Seneca invites us to engage reflectively with our lives, this\ndoes not revise basic Stoic assumptions about the soul. But we might\nalso raise a third question: Can we acceptably, to borrow a term from\nVeyne, \u201cabuse\u201d Seneca for our own purposes, knowing full\nwell that we are reading a certain kind of concern with the self into\nhis works which has more to do with our own times than with a precise\ninterpretation of his work? This is Veyne\u2019s suggestion:\n\u201cStoicism has thus become, for our use, a philosophy of the\nactive turning in on itself of the I [\u2026]. It was\nnothing of the kind in its own day, but the Letters permit us\nto view it as such.\u201d (2003, x).\n\nWhen Seneca discusses how we must hold on to the insight that only\nvirtue is good, in order to improve ourselves, it may sometimes seem\nas if he blamed the world (competition, superficial\nlifestyles, etc.) for the difficulty of the task. But ultimately,\nSeneca argues that we are standing in our own way. He tells his\naddressees that, by living in such-and-such a way, they weigh\nthemselves down (\u2018tibi gravis eris\u2019; On Peace\nof Mind 3.6), or become a problem to themselves (\u2018tu\ntibi molestus es\u2019; Letter 21.1). It is with a view\nto this reflective engagement with one\u2019s thought that Hadot\nfinds \u2018spiritual exercises\u2019 in Roman Stoic philosophy (P.\nHadot 1995, 79\u2013144; cf. Letter 6.1 on\nself-transformation).\n\nCare for one\u2019s soul involves the Socratic project of aiming to\nknow oneself. In the Natural Questions, Seneca says that\nnature has given us mirrors so that we may know ourselves (ut homo\nipse se nosset). Even this external means of seeing\nourselves\u2014which, Seneca deplores, is mostly put to less than\nvirtuous uses\u2014serves a purpose; for example, the young see the\nbloom of their youth, thus being reminded that this is the time for\nstudy and bravery (NQ 1.16.1\u201317.10; cf. Williams 2005).\nUltimately, however, coming to know oneself is a matter of reflective\nself-examination and philosophical study. At the same time, Seneca\nargues that the private life and the public life are cures for each\nother (On Peace of Mind 17.3; cf. Inwood 2005 [12]). This\nbalance may indicate that the project of improving the states of\none\u2019s mind or soul (or \u2018self\u2019) might ultimately\ninvolve what the Stoics call oikei\u00f4sis,\n\u2018affiliation.\u2019 According to Stoic theory, one should fully\nappreciate the way in which everything outside of one\u2019s mind\n\u2018belongs to one\u2019 (one\u2019s body, other human beings,\nother parts of the world, the world as a whole). That is, in finding a\nbalance between retreat and philosophy on the one hand, and the life\nof politics on the other, one is aiming to be a citizen of one\u2019s\nlocal community and of the world (cf. Gill 2009).\n\nLike St. Augustine, whose \u201cturn inside\u201d is as much debated\nby scholars as Seneca\u2019s \u201cturn to the self,\u201d Seneca\nseems to think that turning to one\u2019s soul is not enough\u2014we\nneed to further turn to God. However, for Seneca, the study of nature\nand God seems to be motivated by care for one\u2019s soul (rather\nthan, say, by love for God). In the Natural Questions, Seneca\nsuggests that the reflective engagement with our own soul is but the\nfirst step. Even if we escape the violent emotions and disruptions of\na public life, we might not yet have escaped from ourselves,\nthat is, from an excessive concern with our own particular situation\nand needs. We must turn into ourselves (in se recedendum),\nbut then we must also retreat from ourselves (a se\nrecedendum) (NQ 4.20). From a care of ourselves that\nrevolves around ethical questions, we must turn to the study of nature\nand theology (NQ 1.1\u20138). How does such study liberate\nus? By removing us from our localized concerns, and offering us a\ndistanced, disengaged perspective on them. The study of nature is an\nattempt at overcoming one\u2019s mortality (NQ 1.17). More\nthan that, the ideal of virtue that is at issue in taking care of\none\u2019s soul is, ultimately, the ideal of becoming like\nGod (Russell 2004). This is a thought that perhaps is rather\nforeign to modern psychotherapeutic techniques, and to Foucaultian\nideas about self-care.\n",
