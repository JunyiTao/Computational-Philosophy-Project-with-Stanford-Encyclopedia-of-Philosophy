    "main_text": "Space and Time\n5. Marty\u2019s Legacy\n\nAs a professor in Prague Marty managed to exercise considerable\ninfluence, though this influence in many cases amounted to winning\nconverts to Brentano\u2019s philosophy, even on points where he and\nBrentano diverged. Among these converts were Oskar Kraus, Alfred\nKastil, and Hugo Bergmann. The former two were of course very active\nin editing Brentano\u2019s writings, many of which were taken from\nhis literary remains. Though the resulting editions were not done\naccording to the standards of critical editing and will ultimately\nhave to be replaced, they served for a long time to keep\nBrentano\u2019s thought alive. Marty was accordingly very important\nin the continued interest among philosophers in Brentano through two\nworld wars and an ever-changing philosophical climate that has not\nalways been entirely conducive to the intellectual orientation of\nBrentano, Marty, or other students of Brentano.\n\nAs regards the reception of Marty\u2019s own philosophical views,\nthis can be found in the case of the Prague Linguistic Circle which\narose after his death (Le\u0161ka 1995) and also to some extent in\nPolish philosophy (Wole\u0144ski 1990). Moreover, Marty was by no\nmeans unknown among the Munich phenomenologists (Schuhmann 1990) and\nmay well, with his emphasis on communicative function, have had a hand\nin their theories of speech acts. The most salient case of the\nreception of Marty, however, is that of Karl B\u00fchler\u2019s\ntheory of language, in which Marty\u2019s contribution is explicitly\nacknowledged (B\u00fchler 1934). Be this as it may, Marty\u2019s\nviews still await further examination and possibly further absorption\ninto the continuing developments of linguistics and philosophy of\nlanguage. The lament which was expressed more than eighty years ago\n(Funke 1924), that Marty\u2019s work had not been sufficiently\nappreciated by the linguists of that time, can still very well be\nexpressed today. The main obstacle here, aside from the already\nmentioned charge of psychologism, is the difficulty involved in\nreading his writings. While Meinong and Husserl wrote sentences which\nseem to go on forever, the polemics that Marty incessantly conducts\nmake his works even less palatable than theirs for many a reader,\nespecially since the targets of his polemics are in many cases authors\nwho are either forgotten or known by less than a handful of\nspecialists. It is thus no wonder that no extensive philosophical text\nof his has been translated into English until recently (Marty\n2010a\u20132010d). Nevertheless, a case can be made, as this has\nbriefly been indicated in the foregoing discussion, that the voice of\nMarty was unique in philosophy of mind and especially in philosophy of\nlanguage and perhaps in ontology as well. By no means have the\npossibilities of drawing philosophical sustenance from his work been\nexhausted.\n",
