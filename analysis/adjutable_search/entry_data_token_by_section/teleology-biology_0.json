    "main_text": "Framing the Debate\n1. Framing the Debate\n\nThe discussion about biological teleology has ancient origins. It is\nparticularly prominent in Plato\u2019s depiction of the divine\nCraftsman or \u2018Demiurge\u2019 in the\n Timaeus\n and Aristotle\u2019s discussion of final causes in the\nPhysics (see the section on teleology in the entry on\n Aristotle).\n However, Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s understanding of\nteleology, as well as their arguments for teleology in the natural\nworld, are distinct (Lennox 1992; Ariew 2002; Johnson 2005). Whereas Plato\u2019s\nteleology is anthropocentric and creationist, Aristotle\u2019s is\nnaturalistic and functional. On the Platonic view, the Demiurge is the\nsource of all motion in both the heavens and on earth, and the\nuniverse and all living beings within it are artifacts modeled on the\nForms (see the relevant sections of the entries on\n Plato\n and\n Plato\u2019s metaphysics).\n The goal toward which all things, including living beings, are\ndirected is the external and eternal good of the Forms. In contrast,\non the Aristotelian view, the teleology that directs the behavior of\nliving beings is immanent. For instance, in organismal development,\nthe impetus for this goal-directed process is a principle of change\nwithin the organism, and the telos, or goal, of the development is\nalso an inherent property. Although often conflated, the views of\nPlato and Aristotle on teleology have been influential in historical\ndebates on biological teleology, and one can still find Platonic and\nAristotelian ideas in the current debate on biological functions. \n\nIn addition to its role within ancient philosophy and cosmology,\nteleology has long been an important topic within physiology and\nmedicine. Galen\u2019s On the Use of the Parts (De usu\npartium) is an early example of teleological reasoning applied to\nphysiology (see the section on teleology in the entry on\n Galen).\n In this text, Galen presents a functional analysis of the various\nparts of living organisms, in which \u201cexistence, structure, and\nattributes of all the parts must be explained by reference to their\nfunctions in promoting the activities of the whole organism\u201d\n(Schiefsky 2007: 371). For Galen, a teleological account of parts is\nsuperior to a purely causal-mechanical one, since the function or\npurpose of the part plays an ineliminable role in the explanation of\nthe part and its activities. This Galenic view of anatomy, with its\nexplicitly Aristotelian reliance on final causes, largely dominated\nmedical thought until the seventeenth century. William Harvey\u2019s\nOn the Motion of the Heart and Blood (De motu\ncordis) was seen by many of his contemporaries (e.g., Hobbes,\nDescartes) as a turning point away from the Galenic or Aristotelian\napproaches to anatomy, with their appeal to final causes, toward the\nnew mechanistic and experimental science of the seventeenth century\n(French 1994).  His attempt to empirically establish the structure and\nmotion of the heart without ever claiming to have identified the final\ncause of circulation, as well as his use of mechanical analogies, such\nas the analogy from the expansion of the arteries to the inflation of\na glove, provide some support for this assessment. Robert Boyle,\nhowever, offered a different interpretation of Harvey\u2019s\nwork. Boyle saw it as amenable to his \u2018compatibilist\u2019\napproach that attempted to show that \u201cmechanical and\nteleological explanations of biological phenomena are\ncompatible\u201d (Lennox 1983: 38).  Recent commentators have also\nsuggested Harvey was strongly influenced by Aristotelian teleological\nthinking, and thus is a liminal figure in the transition from vitalist\nto purely mechanistic explanation in physiology and medicine\n(Distelzweig 2014, 2016; Lennox 2017), although Lennox notes that\n\u201cHarvey appears to be pressing the analogy between art and\nnature in ways that are not Aristotelian but more Platonic in\nspirit\u201d (Lennox 2017: 191).\n\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s analysis of teleology in the Critique of\nJudgment (Kant 1790 [2000]) also played an influential role in\nbiology. According to Kant, humans inevitably understand living things\nas if they are teleological systems (Zammito 2006). However, on\nKant\u2019s view, the teleology we see in the natural world is only\napparent; it is the product of our limited cognitive faculties (see\nsection 3 of the entry on\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics).\n But in addition, according to Kant, there is a certain\nnon-machine-like character of organisms, evident in their ability to\ngrow and reproduce, that leads to a type of mechanical\ninexplicability. Hannah Ginsborg (2004) argues that for Kant this\nimpossibility of explaining organisms in solely mechanistic terms does\nnot itself distinguish them from complex artifacts; but, she argues,\nKant thought that the regenerative and reproductive aspects of\norganisms lead us to attribute a kind of natural purposiveness that is\nabsent in artifacts, paralleling Aristotle\u2019s justification for\nnatural, immanent teleology. Kantian analysis of this sort shows up in\nearly nineteenth century research in what would come to be called\norganic chemistry. Scientists at that time sought to determine whether\nliving systems were nothing more than complex chemical systems, fully\nanalyzable in terms of physical and chemical processes. Those\nresearchers adopting a Kantian approach advocated a teleo-mechanist\nstrategy to make sense of the goal-directed nature of living systems,\nwhich sought to treat the organism as both a means and an end and thus\nincorporated elements of both teleological and mechanistic explanation\n(Lenoir 1982). \n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the status of teleology in biology was \nalso contested as part of the vitalist-mechanist debate in physiology \nand medicine (for an overview, see the first section of the entry on\n life).\n Whereas mechanists sought to describe all living things in purely\nmechanical terms, vitalists argued that physical properties alone\ncould not explain the goal-directed organization of living things.\nThey claimed that \u2018vital forces\u2019 were also necessary to\nexplain the difference between physical and living systems. Although\nthey fell out of favor, some vitalist accounts persisted through the\ntwentieth-century, for instance, in philosopher Henri Bergson\u2019s\n\u2018\u00e9lan vital\u2019 (see the section creative\nevolution in the entry on\n Bergson)\n and in biologist-cum-philosopher Hans Driesch\u2019s concept of\n\u2018entelechy\u2019 (Driesch 1908). \n\nMuch debate over the role of teleology in biology in the twentieth\ncentury, especially amongst the architects of the \u2018modern\nsynthesis\u2019, traces back to Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of\nevolution by natural selection. Biologist and philosopher Michael\nGhiselin, expressing a common interpretation of Darwin\u2019s role in\nthis debate, claims in his preface to Darwin\u2019s work on orchids\nthat Darwin\u2019s theory succeeded in \u201cgetting rid of\nteleology and replacing it with a new way of thinking about\nadaptation\u201d (Darwin 1862/1877 [1984: xiii] cited in Lennox 1993:\n409). On this view, the theory of natural selection explains how\nspecies \u201chave been modified so as to acquire that perfection of\nstructure and co-adaptation\u201d without any appeal to a benevolent\nCreator (Darwin 1859: 3). Prior to Darwin, the best explanation for\nbiological adaptation was the argument from design, most influentially\npresented in William Paley\u2019s Natural Theology (Paley\n1802): living things have the structure and behaviors that they do\nbecause they were designed for certain purposes by a benevolent\nCreator (see the entry\non natural theology and natural religion).\nDarwin\u2019s theory provides\nbiology with the resources to resist this argument, offering a fully\nnaturalized explanation for adaptation. Although most agree that\nDarwin\u2019s theory does indeed purge evolutionary biology of any\nillicit appeal to external, Platonic teleology, there is disagreement\nas to whether or not Darwin\u2019s evolutionary explanations are\nteleological (see the relevant section of the entry on\n Darwinism).\n Even Darwin\u2019s contemporaries disagreed as to whether or not the\ntheory of natural selection purged teleological explanations from\nbiology or revived them (Lennox 2010). In any case, it is clear that\nDarwin used the language of \u2018final causes\u2019 to describe the\nfunction of biological parts in his Species Notebooks and throughout\nhis life; he also reflected frequently about the relationship between\nnatural selection and teleology (Lennox 1993). \n",
