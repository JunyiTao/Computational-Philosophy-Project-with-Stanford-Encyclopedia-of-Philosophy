The patient may\nhave had different interests in the past, but how can these be\nrelevant to current decisions, which can only affect the present and\nfuture but not the past? This approach may accept it as unfortunate\nthat the patient's past interests were left unfulfilled, but insists\nthat this unfortunate fact cannot be remedied, and that there is no\nuse in catering to bygone interests in current decision-making\n(Dresser 1986).\n\n\nAn advocate of the threshold view, such as Dworkin, would emphasize\ntwo points in response:\n\n\nFirst, past interests can often be satisfied in the present. Dworkin\ndistinguishes between what he calls \u201cexperiential\u201d and\n\u201ccritical\u201d interests (Dworkin 1993, 201-08). Experiential\ninterests are, roughly, interests in having desirable felt\nexperiences, such as enjoyment (and in avoiding undesirable\nexperiences, such as boredom). These interests are indeed tied to the\npresent: there is no point in trying to satisfy one's past\nexperiential interest in a specific enjoyment (for instance, in\nplaying with dolls), if one at present has no hope of still deriving\nenjoyment from what one used to enjoy in the past. By contrast,\ncritical interests are not tied to the experience of their\nsatisfaction; these are interests in having what one values or cares\nabout become a reality, such as a parent's interest in the success and\nprosperity of his child or a sailor's interest in preserving his\nbeautiful wooden boat. According to Dworkin, such interests can be\nmeaningfully satisfied even if they belong in the past: for example,\neven after the sailor dies, it makes sense to preserve the boat he\ncared about and do so for his sake. Similarly, according to Dworkin,\nit makes sense to satisfy a formerly competent person's critical\ninterests, such as the interest in avoiding the indignity of dementia,\nfor her sake, even if she has ceased to understand those critical\ninterests now.\n\n\nSecond, on a view like Dworkin's, the past critical interests of an\nindividual who formerly possessed the capacity for autonomy are, in a\ncrucial sense, still her interests in the present, even if she can no\nlonger take an interest in them. This is an essential element of the\nclaim that the patient's earlier autonomous self has authority over\nher current non-autonomous self. The thought is this. For any person,\nthe interests she has autonomously defined for herself are her most\nimportant interests. And this is so even for an individual who has\nlost her capacity for autonomy or her personhood: so long as the\nindividual survives the loss as numerically the same entity, her\ninterests stemming from autonomy (or the subset of them that can still\nbe satisfied) remain her most important interests, even if she can't\nespouse them now, and they are, in this sense, \u201cpast.\u201d\nThus, Dworkin offers a powerful rationale for why satisfying\n\u201cpast\u201d interests can still matter, and matter very deeply,\nin the present.\n",
