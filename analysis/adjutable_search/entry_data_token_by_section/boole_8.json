Then in the next several pages he adds\nsupplementary expressions; of these the main ones will be called the\nsecondary expressions.\n\n\nProposition\nPrimary Expression\nSecondary Expression\n\n\nAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\\(x = xy\\)\n\\(x = vy\\)\n\n\nNo \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\\(xy = 0\\)\n\\(x = v(1-y)\\)\n\n\nSome \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\\(v = xy\\)\n\\(vx = vy\\)\n\n\nSome \\(X\\) is not \\(Y\\)\n\\(v = x(1 - y)\\)\n\\(vx = v(1 - y)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe first primary expression given was for All \\(X\\) is\n\\(Y\\), an equation which he then converted into\n\\(x(1-y) = 0\\). This was the first appearance of\n0 in MAL. It was not introduced as the symbol for the empty\nclass\u2014indeed the empty class does not appear in MAL.\nEvidently \u201c\\(= 0\\)\u201d performed the role of a predicate in\nMAL, with an equation \\(E = 0\\) asserting that the class\ndenoted by \\(E\\) simply did not exist. (In LT, what we call the\nempty class was introduced and denoted by 0.)\n\n\n \nSyllogistic reasoning is just an exercise in elimination,\nnamely the middle term is eliminated from the premises to give the\nconclusion. Elimination is a standard topic in the theory of\nequations, and Boole borrowed a simple elimination result regarding\ntwo equations to use in his algebra of logic\u2014if the premises of\na syllogism involved the classes \\(X, Y\\), and\n\\(Z\\), and one wanted to eliminate the middle term \\(Y\\),\nthen Boole put the equations for the two premises in the form\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  ay + b &= 0 \\\\\n  cy + d &= 0\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(y\\) does not appear in the coefficients a,b,c,d.\nThe result of eliminating \\(y\\) in ordinary algebra gives the\nequation\n\n\\[\n  ad - bc = 0,\n\\]\n\n\n\nand this is what Boole used in MAL. Unfortunately this is a\nweak elimination result for Boole\u2019s algebra. One finds, using the\nimproved reduction and elimination theorems of LT, that the\nbest possible result of elimination is\n\n\\[\n(b^2 + d^2)[(a + b)^2 + (c + d)^2 ] = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n \nApplying weak elimination to the primary equational expressions was not \nsufficient to derive all of the valid syllogisms. For example, in the cases \nwhere the premises had primary expressions \\(ay = 0\\) and \\(cy = 0\\),\nthis elimination gave \\(0 = 0\\), even when there was a non-trivial \nconclusion.  Boole introduced the alternative equational\nexpressions (see MAL, p. 32) of categorical propositions to\nbe able to derive all of the valid syllogisms. \n\n\nToward the end of the chapter on categorical syllogisms there is a\nlong footnote (MAL, pp. 42\u201345) claiming\n(MAL, pp. 42, 43) that secondary expressions alone are\nsufficient for the analysis of [his generalization of] Aristotelian\ncategorical logic. The footnote loses much of its force because the\nresults it presents depend heavily on the weak elimination theorem\nbeing best possible, which is not the case. Regarding the secondary\nexpressions, in the Postscript to MAL he says:\n\nThe system of equations there given for the expression of Propositions\nin Syllogism is always preferable to the one before\nemployed\u2014first, in generality\u2014secondly, in facility of\ninterpretation.\n\n\nHis justification of this claim would appear in LT. \nIndeed Boole used only the secondary expressions of MAL to \nexpress propositions as equations in LT, but there the \nreader will no longer find a leisurely and detailed treatment of Aristotelian logic\u2014the discussion of this subject is delayed until \nthe last chapter on logic, namely Chapter XV (the only one in LT to \nanalyze particular propositions). In this chapter the application of his\nalgebra of logic to Aristotelian logic is presented in such a compressed form \n(by omitting all details of \nthe reduction, elimination and solution steps), concluding with such long \nequations, that the reader is not likely to want to check that Boole\u2019s analysis is correct.\n\n",
