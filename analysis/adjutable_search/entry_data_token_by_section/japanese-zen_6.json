    "main_text": "Zen as Anti-Philosophy\n4. Zen as Anti-Philosophy\n\nAs may be surmised from the foregoing explanation on Zen\u2019s\nmethodological stance, it is perhaps best to understand Zen as an\nanti-philosophy if the term \u201cphilosophy\u201d is taken to mean\nthe establishment of \u201cthe kingdom of reason.\u201d That\nenterprise has been launched as an intellectual effort of the most\nbrilliant minds in Europe since the modern period to find new ways to\nground our conception of human nature, something beyond the\ntraditional Christian dogmas that had incorporated classic\nAristotelian and Platonic views. Since then, various Western\nphilosophers have attempted to capture human nature with this goal in\nmind by using ego-consciousness as a starting point as well as a\ndestination in philosophy. For example, human nature has been\ncharacterized in terms of ego-consciousness (Descartes), Reason,\nPersonality, Transcendental Subjectivity (Kant and Husserl), Life\n(Dilthey), Existence (Existential philosophers such as Kierkegaard,\nJaspers and Sartre) and Dasein (Heidegger). (See Yuasa 2003,\n160\u201361.)\n\nBy contrast, Zen\u2019s stance of \u201canti-philosophy\u201d\nmaintains among other things that reason in its discursive use is\nincapable of knowing and understanding in toto what reality\nis, for example, what human beings are and what their relation to\nnature is. For this reason, Zen contends that physical nature and\nhuman nature must be sought in an experiential dimension\npractically trans-descending, and hence transcending, the\nstandpoint of ego-consciousness. That is to say, it must go beyond\n\u201cthe one\u201d and \u201cthe two,\u201d as both of these\nstances are prone to generate a one-sided stance, and hence incomplete\nworld-view. Instead, they must be sought in the depths of one\u2019s\npsyche\u0304 and beyond. For example, Zen Master Seigen\n(Chin; Q\u012bngyu\u00e1ng, 660\u2013740) expresses the process of\nself-cultivation to the effect that: \u201cBefore the practice,\nmountains are mountains, during the practice, mountains are not\nmountains, and after the realization, mountains are [truly] mountains\n[again].\u201d In the meditational process of discovery then, Zen\nmoves from an ordinary, commonsensical standpoint to an extraordinary\nstandpoint, and with this transformation returns to the everyday\nlifeworld, wherein no Aristotelian either-or logic is accepted as the\nstandard for knowing and understanding reality. As a result,\nparadoxes, contradictions, and even what appears to be utter nonsense\nabound in Zen literature. The k\u014dan method mentioned\nabove exemplifies this point. To cite just one such example:\n\u201cthe river does not flow but the bridge does.\u201d If one\nattempts to understand that by relying on an Aristotelian either-or logic\nas the standard for understanding, one will be under the\nimpression that this expression is nonsensical or meaningless.\n\nAs may be surmised, by relying on the above-mentioned methodological\nstance, Zen Buddhism has produced an understanding of\nreality\u2014one\u2019s own self, nature with life activities and\nhuman nature\u2014quite different from those offered by Western\nphilosophy. Therefore, we can say that Zen is an anti-philosophy in\nthat it is not a systematization of knowledge built on the use of a\ndiscursive mode of reasoning anchored in the (alleged) certainty or\ntransparency of ego-consciousness, one that follows an epistemological\nparadigm built on an ego-logical, either-or, dualistic mode of\nknowing. Yet, it upholds something like a philosophy that\nsprings forth through a reflective restatement of the practice, though\nthis \u201cupholding\u201d must be understood with a proviso that it\nmaintains, as mentioned in the foregoing, a \u201cpositionless\nposition.\u201d (Abe, 1989.) This is because Zen abhors\n\u201cholding onto\u201d anything, which Zen considers a case of\n\u201cself-binding without a rope.\u201d Such a self-binding would\ntrap the Zen practitioner into a mode of attachment that is the source\nof suffering and, consequently, would disrupt the sense of embodied\nfreedom it cherishes.\n",
