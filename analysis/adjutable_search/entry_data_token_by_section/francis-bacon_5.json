    "main_text": "Scientific Method: The Project of the Instauratio Magna\n4. Scientific Method: The Project of the Instauratio Magna\n\nThe Great Instauration, Bacon's main work, was\npublished in 1620 under the title: Franciscus de Verulamio Summi\nAngliae Cancellaris Instauratio magna. This great work remained a\nfragment, since Bacon was only able to finish parts of the planned\noutline. The volume was introduced by a Prooemium, which gives\na general statement of the purpose, followed by a Dedication\nto the King (James I) and a Preface, which is a summary of all\n\u201cdirections, motifs, and significance of his life-work\u201d\n(Sessions 1996, 71). After that, Bacon printed the plan of the\nInstauratio, before he turned to the strategy of his research\nprogram, which is known as Novum Organum Scientiarum.\nAltogether the 1620 book constitutes the second part of Part II of the\nInstauratio, the first part of which is represented by De\nAugmentis and Book I of The Advancement of Learning. When\nBacon organized his Instauratio, he divided it into six parts,\nwhich reminded contemporary readers of God's work of the six days\n(the creation), already used by writers like Guillaume Du Bartas\n(La Sepmaine, ou Cr\u00e9ation du Monde, 1579, transl. by\nJoshua Sylvester, Bartas His Devine Weekes &\nWorkes, 1605) and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola\n(Heptaplus, 1489).\n\n\nBacon sees nature as a labyrinth, whose workings cannot be\nexclusively explained by reference to \u201cexcellence of wit\u201d\nand \u201crepetition of chance experiments\u201d: \n\nOur steps\nmust be guided by a clue, and see what way from the first perception of\nthe sense must be laid out upon a sure plan. (Bacon IV [1901],\n18)\n\n\nBacon's Plan of the Work runs as follows (Bacon IV\n[1901], 22):\n\nThe Divisions of the Sciences.\nThe New Organon; or Directions concerning the Interpretation of\nNature.\nThe Phenomena of the Universe; or a Natural and Experimental\nHistory for the foundation of Philosophy.\nThe Ladder of Intellect.\nThe Forerunners; or Anticipations of the New\nPhilosophy.\nThe New Philosophy; or Active Science.\n\n\n\nPart 1 contains the general description of the sciences including\ntheir divisions as they presented themselves in Bacon's time.\nHere he aimed at a distinction between what was already invented and\nknown in contrast to \u201cthings omitted which ought be there\u201d\n(Bacon IV [1901], 23). This part could be taken from The\nAdvancement of Learning (1605) and from the revised and enlarged\nversion De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum (1623).\n\n\nPart 2 develops Bacon's new method for scientific\ninvestigation, the Novum Organum, equipping the intellect to\npass beyond ancient arts and thus producing a radical revision of the\nmethods of knowledge; but it also introduces a new epistemology and a\nnew ontology. Bacon calls his new art Interpretatio Naturae,\nwhich is a logic of research going beyond ordinary logic, since his\nscience aims at three inventions: of arts (not arguments), of\nprinciples (not of things in accordance to principles), and of\ndesignations and directions for works (not of probable reasons). The\neffect Bacon looks for is to command nature in action, not to overcome\nan opponent in argument. The Novum Organum is the only part of\nthe Instauratio Magna which was brought near to\ncompletion.\n\n\nPart 3 was going to contain natural and experimental history or the\nrecord of the phenomena of the universe. According to De Augmentis\nScientarum (Bacon IV [1901], 275), natural history is split up\ninto narrative and inductive, the latter of which is supposed \u201cto\nminister and be in order to the building up of\nPhilosophy\u201d. These functional histories support human memory\nand provide the material for research, or the factual\nknowledge of nature, which must be certain and reliable. Natural\nhistory starts from and emphasizes the subtlety of nature or her\nstructural intricacy, but not the complexity of philosophical systems,\nsince they have been produced by the human mind. Bacon sees this part\nof Instauratio Magna as a foundation for the reconstruction of\nthe sciences in order to produce physical and metaphysical knowledge.\nNature in this context is studied under experimental conditions, not\nonly in the sense of the history of bodies, but also as a history of\nvirtues or original passions, which refer to the desires of matter\n(Rees 1975a). This knowledge was regarded by Bacon as a preparation\nfor Part 6, the Second Philosophy or Active Science,\nfor which he gave only the one example of Historia Ventorum\n(1622); but\u2014following his plan to compose six prototypical\nnatural histories\u2014he also wrote Historia vitae et\nmortis(1623) and the Historia densi, which was left in\nmanuscript. The text, which develops the idea of Part 3, is called\nParasceve ad Historiam Naturalem et Experimentalem.\n\n\nPart 4, which Bacon called The Ladder of Intellect or\nScala Intellectus, was intended to function as a link between\nthe method of natural history and that of Second Philosophy/Active\nScience. It consists not only of the fragment Filum labyrinthi\n(Bacon III [1887], 493\u2013504), but also includes the\nAbecedarium nouum naturae (OFB XIII, xxi), which was\nplanned as a preface to all of section 4 \u201c[to] demonstrate the\nwhole process of the mind\u201d (OFB XIII, xxii). Filum\nlabyrinthi is similar to, but not identical with, Cogitata et\nVisa. Speaking of himself in an authorial voice, Bacon reflects on\nthe state of science and derives his construction of a research program\nfrom the gaps and deficiencies within the system of disciplines:\nsciences of the future should be examined and further ones should be\ndiscovered. Emphasis must be laid on new matter (not on controversies).\nIt is necessary to repudiate superstition, zealous religion, and false\nauthorities. Just as the Fall was not caused by knowledge of nature,\nbut rather by moral knowledge of good and evil, so knowledge of natural\nphilosophy is for Bacon a contribution to the magnifying of God's\nglory, and, in this way, his plea for the growth of scientific\nknowledge becomes evident.\n\n\nPart 5 deals with the forerunners or anticipations of the new\nphilosophy, and Bacon emphasizes that the \u2018big machinery\u2019\nof the Instauratio Magna needs a good deal of time to be\ncompleted. Anticipations are ways to come to scientific inferences\nwithout recourse to the method presented in the Novum Organum.\nMeanwhile, he has worked on his speculative system, so that portions of\nhis Second Philosophy are treated and finished: De Fluxu et Refluxu\nMaris and Thema Coeli. For this part of the Great\nInstauration, texts are planned that draw philosophical\nconclusions from collections of facts which are not yet sufficient for\nthe use or application of Bacon's inductive method.\n\n\nPart 6 was scheduled to contain Bacon's description of the new\nphilosophy, as the last part of his Great Instauration; but\nnothing came of this plan, so that there is no extant text at all from\nthis part of the project.\n",
