    "main_text": "Kinds of Judgments\n2. Kinds of Judgments\n\nOne of the most controversial, influential, and striking parts of\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment is his multiple classification of\njudgments according to kinds of logical form and kinds of semantic\ncontent. Indeed the very importance of Kant\u2019s multiple\nclassification of judgments has sometimes led to the misconception\nthat his theory of judgment will stand or fall according to the fate\nof, e.g., his analytic-synthetic distinction, or his doctrine of\nsynthetic a priori judgments. Important as these classifications are\nhowever, it is crucial to remember that the core of Kant\u2019s\ntheory of judgment consists in the centrality thesis, the\npriority-of-the-proposition thesis, and the transcendental idealism\nthesis, all of which can still hold even if some of his\nclassifications of judgments are rejected.\n",
