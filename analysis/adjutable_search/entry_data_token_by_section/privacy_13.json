(2015) ushers in a cogent articulation and defense of\nprivacy even when privacy seems to conflict with other important\nvalues. Recent technological developments are concerning, with\nimplications for the moral, legal and social foundations and\ninterrelationships between privacy, security and accountability.\nKatell and Moore (2016: 3) make use of a control-based definition of\nprivacy, stating that a right to privacy is \u201ca right to control\naccess to, and uses of, places, bodies, and personal\ninformation\u201d. They also write that\n\n\nthe ability to control access to our bodies, capacities, and powers,\nand to sensitive personal information, is an essential part of human\nflourishing or well-being. (Katell & Moore 2016: 5)\n\n\nKenneth Himma\n\n\nargues that security is a more important right that always\n\u201ctrumps\u201d privacy, which on his view is not an absolute or\nfundamental right, but merely \u201cinstrumental\u201d to other\nrights. (Katell & Moore 2016: 12 and Himma 2016; both in A. Moore\n2016)\n\n\nHimma\u2019s defense is based on his view that security is\nfundamental to survival\u2014our most valuable duty and obligation.\nIn contrast, responding to this view, Adam Moore defends privacy over\nsecurity with multiple arguments, perhaps the most powerful of which\nis demonstrating \u201cthe importance of privacy as a bulwark against\nthe tyrannical excesses of an unchecked security state\u201d (Katell\n& Moore 2016: 13 and Moore 2016b). As the authors in this volume\nnote, there is good reason to conclude that privacy, security and\naccountability are all morally valuable.\n\nOver the course of the last few years (and especially between 2020 and\n2023), the conflict between privacy and health, or privacy and safety,\nhas been the topic of much discussion\u2014particularly from the\nperspective of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an early attempt to develop\nsuitable guidelines, Morley et al. (2020) have postulated that not\nonly should privacy be protected, but also equality and fairness\nobserved in digital contact-tracing. However, such contact-tracing\napps clearly bring about a conflict between privacy and the health of\npeople. Throughout the course of the pandemic, such contact-tracing\napps were contested (see Bengio et al. 2020; Fahey & Hino\n2020).\n",
