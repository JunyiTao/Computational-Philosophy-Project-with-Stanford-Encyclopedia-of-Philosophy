    "main_text": "The Classical Chinese Language: What, How, and Why Does It Convey What It Conveys? || On the Syntax of Classical Chinese\n1.2 On the Syntax of Classical Chinese\nRoughly speaking, if phonetics/phonology is the study of the\nrelation of words to their sounds, and semantics the relation of words\nto meaning, then syntax is the study of the relation of words to each\nother, which is what we usually think of as grammar. Classical Chinese\nis an isolating language, meaning that each graph stands alone at all\ntimes, in isolation, without affixes of any kind, and unmarked for\ncase, number, gender, or tense. The third-person pronoun ta\ncan be he, him, her, she, it; they, them. And so can the\ngraph qi, \u5176. qu, \u53bb, retains exactly\nthat form for go, going, gone, and went. What follows is that most\nChinese characters can serve equally as both nouns and verbs, and\nmodifiers too (adjectives and adverbs); apart from context no graph\nhas a unique grammatical function. Word order is supposedly fixed,\nbeing Subject-Verb-Object, but so-called nouns regularly default to\nverbs (e.g., \u201crunning is a strenuous exercise\u201d). Style\nalso made the topic subject of the sentence difficult to ascertain, as\nwhen the head noun or object was omitted whenever context made it even\nslightly clear who or what it was.\nNot infrequently the identity of the omitted subject\nwas not clear, even to fairly knowledgeable readers.\nConsider one of the love poems in the Book of Odes about a\nnoblewoman and her knightly lover, translated three different ways.\nFirst, (Legge 1871: 150): \n  \u201cThe cock has crowed The court is\nfull\u201d But it was not the cock that was\ncrowing,\u2014 It was the sound of the blue\nflies.   \nSecond (Waley 1960: 37):\n  The Lady: The cock has crowed; it is full\ndaylight The Lover: It was not the cock that crowed, It\nwas the buzzing of those green flies.   \nThird, (Pound 1954: 45):\n Cock\u2019s crow\u2019d. The courtiers are all\nCrowding the hall.\u2019 Cock hasn\u2019t, she lies But\none hears some blue flies.  \nNow in the first translation, we don\u2019t know who says the cock\nhas crowed. In the second it is the Lady, and in the third, her lover.\nAnd these patterns continue through the remaining stanzas. Clearly the\npoem will be differently understood and enjoyed depending on who we\nthink is saying what. Legge and Waley are very well known translators,\nand if some sinologists arch their eyebrows at including Ezra\nPound\u2019s work\u2014he knew only the rudiments of classical\nChinese when he began it\u2014there are others who admire\nPound\u2019s efforts, especially his translation of\nthe Analects as well as the Odes (Harbsmeier 1990:\n140; for an appreciation of Pound of another kind in this regard, see\nNylan 2014: xxxiii\u2013xl). An equally ubiquitous stylistic rule was\nto employ parallel construction of sentences. At times this proved\nextremely helpful for interpreting opaque sentences, when they\npreceded or followed others structurally the same. But just as often\nvagueness and/or indeterminacy resulted for all save the first\npair.\nThus, while matters of style are formally distinguished from syntax\nin the study of languages, they are neverthless linked closely\ntogether in classical Chinese, making many sentences difficult to\nunderstand even in context. (At times it makes them easier: style,\nespecially parallelism, can at times indicate the best syntactic\nreading of a passage). Overall\u2014especially with its lack of\ninflections\u2014the language can be said to be \u201csyntactically\noverdetermined\u201d in that there may well be a number of\ngrammatically possible ways of interpreting a syntactically generated\nsentence (Fuller 1999: 2; Karlgren 1962). In a number of cases more\nthan one reading will be consistent with the context of the section,\nand/or the entire text. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of\npunctuation in early classical Chinese: no periods, colons,\nsemi-colons, dashes, commas, or parentheses were inserted into texts\nuntil much later, and both then and now you can get very different\nreadings of a text depending on where you place a comma and/or a\nperiod (for example: \u201cJohn thought Marsha was a fool\u201d;\n\u201cJohn, thought Marsha, was a fool\u201d). The written language\ncompensates in part for the lack of punctuation marks by the use of\n\u201cfunction words\u201d, graphs that have little or no meaning on\ntheir own, but serve as grammatical instructions: zhe,\n\u8005, for example, usually nominalizes what precedes\nit; ye, \u4e5f, is a phrase-final marker; hu,\n\u4e4e, concludes sentences to be read interrogatively; and so on. A\nfew other graphs serve as both function words and meaning words. The\ngraph zhi, \u4e4b, is a sign of the genitive. Unfortunately\nfor easy reading, it can also be used as a pronoun, and as another\nword for \u201cto go\u201d. That is to say, it is not always easy to\nsee the syntactic category into which zhi should be placed in\na sentence. Indeed, it has even been maintained that while the focus\nof language in English is the sentence, in classical Chinese it is\ncontext (DeFrancis 1984: 52; Hansen 1992: 34).\nThere is much more to say about the syntax of classical Chinese,\nand the ways in which it does not reflect exactly the syntax of the\nspoken language at any time, but for the purpose of understanding\nissues of translation in Chinese philosophy, we might let the author\nof a contemporary textbook of classical Chinese have the last word\n(Fuller 1999: 2):\n  [T]here may be several perfectly grammatical ways to\nexplain the syntax of a [classical Chinese] sentence. Skill in reading\nlies in deciding which alternative is most likely\u2026 Such\njudgments of meaning cannot be based on grammar alone. They rely not\nonly on a knowledge of grammar, but also on a sense of the larger\narguments of the sentence, the paragraph, and the composition as a\nwhole.\n",
