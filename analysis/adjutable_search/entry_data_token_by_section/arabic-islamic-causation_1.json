According to\nal-Ash\u02bfar\u012b, the doctrine of divine power requires that God\nbe in complete control of the production of all atoms and accidents.\nFor this reason, he rejected the Mu\u02bftazilite view that human\nagents create or generate certain accidents.\nAl-Ash\u02bfar\u012b developed a rival position on human\naction, whose core doctrine is divine creation of the powers by which\nhuman beings perform their actions (Frank 1966). Suppose, again,\nthat I intentionally strike you and that, as a result, you fall into a\ncoma. As al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b sees it, this occurs by God creating in\nme a power through which I generate your falling into a coma. This\npower is a power for a specific action, namely, my striking you in a\nparticular way at a particular time. It is an accident that\nbelongs to me only temporarily. Though the power is in me, God is in\ncomplete control of what happens, since he elects to create the power.\nAl-Ash\u02bfar\u012b and his followers used the term kasb\n(acquisition) to designate this type of power. In his treatise On\nPower, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (1056\u20131111) explains the\ndoctrine of acquisition as a middle position between that of the\ndeterminists, who deny that created things have power, and that of the\nMu\u02bftazilites, who hold that humanity produces certain accidents.\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b rejects the determinist position on the\nground that it cannot account for the difference between a deliberate\nhuman action and an involuntary one, such as a bodily tremor. And\nhe also rejects the Mu\u02bftazilite position; central to his\nargument against them is an appeal to the pervasiveness of divine\npower. On the basis of his analysis of these rival positions,\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b draws two conclusions. First, it must be possible\nfor two possessors of power, a human being and God, to be related to\nthe same object of power. Second, the power possessed by the human\nbeing cannot be causally related to the object of power because this\nwould conflict with the pervasiveness of divine power. He links these\nconclusions to the doctrine of acquisition. As he sees it, this\ndoctrine attributes created power to humanity, but it also maintains\nthat the relationship between this created power and its object is\nnon-causal (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b AIFI; McGinnis and Reisman 2007:\n254\u2013265; Marmura 1994). This account of acquisition\nsuggests that God alone has causal power.\n\nIn sum, whereas Mu\u02bftazilite theologians appealed to divine\njustice to show that the circle of agents includes God and humanity,\nal-Ash\u02bfar\u012b and his followers appealed to divine omnipotence\nto limit agency to God alone. Broadly speaking, Ash\u02bfarite\ntheologians seem to endorse occasionalism, the view that God is the\nonly true cause. Some interpreters, however, consider\nal-Ash\u02bfar\u012b\u2019s claim that human beings are the subjects\nof temporary powers for specific actions to indicate that his position\nfalls short of full-blown occasionalism (Frank 1966).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite theologians also attacked Aristotelian views of\ncausation. Some of their arguments were addressed by\nArabic fal\u0101sifah. Relayed by\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Ash\u02bfarite accounts\nof causation contributed to the development of occasionalist\ndoctrines in Medieval and Early Modern Europe (Nadler 1996;\nPerler and Rudolph 2000).
