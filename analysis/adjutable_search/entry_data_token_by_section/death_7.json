    "main_text": "Death || Being Dead\n2.3 Being Dead\n\nPeople often speak of being dead as a \u2018state\u2019 or\n\u2018condition\u2019 as opposed to an event or process. They say an\norganism comes to be in this state once it dies. This way of speaking\ncan be puzzling on the assumption that what dies ceases to exist.\n(This assumption is discussed below.) If the assumption is true, then\nan organism that dies stops existing but simultaneously comes to be in\nthe state of death. Mustn\u2019t something exist at a time if it is\n(literally) in some state at that time? But of course it would be\nabsurd to deny that something can truly be dead on the grounds that\ndeath is a state and what does not exist at a time cannot be in any\nstate at that time.\n\nWhy not solve the problem by saying that upon dying an organism leaves\na corpse, and it is the corpse that is in the state of being dead?\nThere are several problems with this suggestion. Some organisms do not\nleave corpses. What corpses are left eventually disintegrate. Whether\nan organism leaves a corpse or not, and whether its corpse exists or\nnot, if that organism dies at time t and does not regain life\nthen it is dead after t.\n\nThe difficulty can be avoided if we say, with Jay Rosenberg 1983, p.\n42), that dead is a relation between an organism, the time it died,\nand a subsequent time, and that when someone asserts, at some given\ntime t, \u2018Socrates is dead,\u2019 what is asserted\n(ignoring the possibility of restored life, discussed in the next\nsection) is roughly that Socrates died before t.\n\nAs is mentioned below, some theorists deny that an object that is at\none time an organism may continue its existence as a corpse. Such\ntheorists will say that organisms and their corpses are two different\nobjects. They may conclude that \u2018dead\u2019 is\nambiguous\u2014that it means one thing as applied to organisms, and\nanother thing as attributed to the corpses organisms leave. In any\ncase, they will need to deny that, as concerns corpses, being dead\nimplies having died, as corpses are never alive, according to them.\nIf, on the other hand, an object that is an organism may continue its\nexistence as a corpse, then, at any time t after that object\ndies, \u2018dead\u2019 applies univocally to it at time t,\nand means roughly died before t.\n",
