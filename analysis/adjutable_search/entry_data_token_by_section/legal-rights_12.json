    "main_text": "Legal Rights as Outcomes\n7. Legal Rights as Outcomes\n\nLegal rights are often expressions of conclusions of law (Hart 1953:\n15\u201317). For instance, civil rights are regularly treated as\narticulations of the parameters of government power as it relates to\nthe liberties of individuals; parameters set by legal officials,\nideally based on assessing the various relevant considerations. Once\nsaid assessment is completed, officials such as judges pronounce their\nruling in terms of the parties\u2019 \u201crights\u201d.\n\u201cRight as outcome\u201d is comfortable within the Hohfeldian\npicture of rights. Because if rights embody legal relations, they\narguably entail correlatives as a conceptual matter, relying on other\nreasons for the matter of their justification (Halpin 1997:\n31\u201332). \n\nFor example, the American Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) involved a national\nnonprofit organization which limited full membership to males aged\n18\u201334. This appeared in friction with the State of\nMinnesota\u2019s Human Rights Act on account of\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. The U.S. Supreme Court framed the\nlegal matter as \n\n\na conflict between a State\u2019s efforts to eliminate gender-based\ndiscrimination against its citizens and the constitutional freedom of\nassociation. (612) \n\n\nRuling against United States Jaycees, the court held that the\norganization\u2019s rights under the First Amendment did not\nextend to its discriminatory practice, reasoning that the\norganization\u2019s interests in freedom of association were\noutweighed by the State\u2019s interest. Another example involves\ncourts bestowing legal status. Court may appoint individuals to\nvarious roles, such as guardian, trustee, receiver, or executive of an\nestate. These appointments, along with the powers, liberties, claims,\nand immunities attached to them, are legal rights granted not on the\ngrounds of the rights themselves, but as the conclusion of judicial\ndeliberation involving other reasons.\n\nNotice that even when legal rights are indeed outcomes, the same is\nnot necessarily true of the valuable functions such rights\nwould serve\n (Section 4).\n For instance, the relevant interests that a right\u2014if\nrecognized\u2014would further and protect for the right-holder, can\nand do play a role in the justification and in determining the scope\nof that right. In fact, very often it is the interests or dignity of\nthe parties to a legal dispute that guides courts in reaching a\nruling; which is then expressed in terms of the scope of the\nparties\u2019 relevant legal \u201crights\u201d.\n\nA virtue of \u201cright as outcome\u201d is that once the scope of a\nright is determined, from that point on that right can serve as a\nmarker of the balance of the potentially complex legal reasoning\nunderlying it; thereby providing legal guidance and certainty as to\nwhat people can roughly expect as a matter of right, and avoiding the\nneed for repetitive ad hoc decision-making in subsequent\nsimilar cases. \n\nJurisprudentially, \u201cright as outcome\u201d is hospitable to\nskeptics of legal formalism. In a nutshell, formalism is the view that\nlegal determinations are governed by a logic internal to law itself,\nwithout referencing or relying on extra-legal reasons or\nconsiderations (for example moral, social, ideological, or\nself-interested). A criticism of formalism typical to \u201clegal\nrealists\u201d, is that the canons of legal interpretations and the\nlanguage and categories of the law\u2014such as\n\u201crights\u201d\u2014cannot fully determine law\u2019s edicts.\nIn reality, the criticism continues, extra-legal forces and reasons\nare often (if not always) explicitly or implicitly incorporated into\ndeterminations of what the law is (see Leiter 2005: 50\u201353). The\nmore skeptical one is of the notion of legal reasons, the more likely\nit is that one would view \u201clegal rights\u201d as empty\nformalistic rhetoric and less as genuine reasons for legal\ndeterminations (e.g., F. S. Cohen 1935). As such, it makes sense to\ntransform law\u2019s language of \u201crights\u201d into mere\nlegalistic expression of the culmination of the extra-legal\nconsiderations determinative of what law is and what it ought to\nbe.\n\nNormatively, over the centuries many have thought of legal rights as\n(at least ideally) reflective of natural rights, that is of moral\nrights not depended on enforcement or social convention, or\nrecognition; a view rooted in the\n natural law\n tradition. Legal rights are also often associated with\n deontological\n principles, eschewing considerations of utility and policy. \n\nThe more dominant such views on the content of legal rights, the more\nlikely are those dismissive of natural rights and deontology to grow\nhostile to treating legal rights as reasons. Accordingly, given the\ninfluence (especially over the past 150 years) of approaches to\npolitical morality based on consequentialist considerations of\nutility, public policy, or the common good, it is not surprising to\nfind occasions of legal rights relegated from weighty legal reasons to\nmere vessels for the legalistic expression of underlying public\npolicy. A key philosophical figure in this regard was Jeremy Bentham\n(1843b: 490\u2013534; see Hart 1962: 311\u2013314; Edmundson 2004:\n51\u201359). Bentham advocated the view that law ought to promote\ngood social consequences, as opposed to reflecting what he viewed as\nvague, dogmatic, antiquated, and moralistic notions of natural rights,\nfamously branding the transplanting of natural rights into law as a\nform of \u201cmischievous nonsense\u201d (Bentham 1843b: 501). \n",
