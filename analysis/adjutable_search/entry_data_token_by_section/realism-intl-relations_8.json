    "main_text": "Neorealism || Objections to Neorealism\n3.2 Objections to Neorealism\n\nIn 1979 Waltz wrote that in the nuclear age the international bipolar\nsystem, based on two superpowers\u2014the United States and the\nSoviet Union\u2014was not only stable but likely to persist\n(176\u20137). With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent\ndisintegration of the USSR this prediction was proven wrong. The\nbipolar world turned out to have been more precarious than most\nrealist analysts had supposed. Its end opened new possibilities and\nchallenges related to globalization. This has led many critics to\nargue that neorealism, like classical realism, cannot adequately\naccount for changes in world politics.\n\nThe new debate between international (neo)realists and (neo)liberals\nis no longer concerned with the questions of morality and human\nnature, but with the extent to which state behavior is influenced by\nthe anarchic structure of the international system rather than by\ninstitutions, learning and other factors that are conductive to\ncooperation. In his 1989 book International Institutions and State\nPower, Robert Keohane accepts Waltz\u2019s emphasis on\nsystem-level theory and his general assumption that states are\nself-interested actors that rationally pursue their goals. However, by\nemploying game theory he shows that states can widen the perception of\ntheir self-interest through economic cooperation and involvement in\ninternational institutions. Patterns of interdependence can thus\naffect world politics. Keohane calls for systemic theories that would\nbe able to deal better with factors affecting state interaction, and\nwith change.\n\nCritical theorists, such as Robert W. Cox, also focus on the alleged\ninability of neorealism to deal with change. In their view,\nneorealists take a particular, historically determined state-based\nstructure of international relations and assume it to be universally\nvalid. In contrast, critical theorists believe that by analyzing the\ninterplay of ideas, material factors, and social forces, one can\nunderstand how this structure has come about, and how it may\neventually change (Cox 1986). They contend that neorealism ignores\nboth the historical process during which identities and interests are\nformed, and the diverse methodological possibilities. It legitimates\nthe existing status quo of strategic relations among states and\nconsiders the scientific method as the only way of obtaining\nknowledge. It represents an exclusionary practice, an interest in\ndomination and control.\n\nWhile realists are concerned with relations among states and national\nsecurity, the focus for critical theorists is human security and\nsocial emancipation. They focus on social, economic and environmental\nsecurity for the individual and the group. Despite their differences,\ncritical theory, postmodernism and feminism all take issue with the\nnotion of state sovereignty and envision new political communities\nthat would be less exclusionary vis-\u00e0-vis marginal and\ndisenfranchised groups. Critical theory argues against state-based\nexclusion and denies that the interests of a country\u2019s citizens\ntake precedence over those of outsiders. It insists that politicians\nshould give as much weight to the interests of foreigners as they give\nto those of their compatriots and envisions political structures\nbeyond the \u201cfortress\u201d nation-state. Postmodernism\nquestions the state\u2019s claim to be a legitimate focus of human\nloyalties and its right to impose social and political boundaries. It\nsupports cultural diversity and stresses the interests of minorities.\nFeminism argues that the realist theory exhibits a masculine bias and\nadvocates the inclusion of woman and alternative values into public\nlife.\n\nSince critical theories and other alternative theoretical perspectives\nquestion the existing status quo, make knowledge dependent on power,\nand emphasize identity formation and social change, they are not\ntraditional or non-positivist. They are sometimes called\n\u201creflectivist\u201d or \u201cpost-positivist\u201d (Weaver\n165) and represent a radical departure from the neorealist and\nneoliberal \u201crationalist\u201d or \u201cpositivist\u201d\ninternational relation theories. For critical security theorists,\nsecurity is not an objective phenomenon. It is essentially social,\nsocially constructed and serves a political agenda. It legitimizes and\nimposes a political program on society that serves the dominant group.\nAccording to the critical securitization theory, the securitizing\nactor, who could be a politician or the governing party,\n\u201cencodes a subject or a group as an existential threat to the\nreference object\u201d (Ari 147). The object could be a state or a\nnon-state group. Such a discursive practice defines threat and\ndanger.\n\nConstructivists, such as Alexander Wendt, try to build a bridge\nbetween these two approaches, positivist and post-positivist, by on\nthe one hand, taking the present state system and anarchy seriously,\nand on the other hand, by focusing on the formation of identities and\ninterests. Countering neorealist ideas, Wendt argues that self-help\ndoes not follow logically or casually from the principle of anarchy.\nIt is socially constructed. Wendt\u2019s idea that states\u2019\nidentities and interests are socially constructed has earned his\nposition the label \u201cconstructivism\u201d. Consequently, in his\nview,\u201cself-help and power politics are institutions, and not\nessential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of\nit\u201d (Wendt 1987 395). There is no single logic of anarchy but\nrather several, depending on the roles with which states identify\nthemselves and each other. Power and interests are constituted by\nideas and norms. Wendt claims that neorealism cannot account for\nchange in world politics, but his norm-based constructivism can.\n\nA similar conclusion, although derived in a traditional way, comes\nfrom the non-positivist theorists of the English school (International\nSociety approach) who emphasize both systemic and normative\nconstraints on the behavior of states. Referring to the classical view\nof the human being as an individual that is basically social and\nrational, capable of cooperating and learning from past experiences,\nthese theorists emphasize that states, like individuals, have\nlegitimate interests that others can recognize and respect, and that\nthey can recognize the general advantages of observing a principle of\nreciprocity in their mutual relations (Jackson and S\u00f8rensen\n167). Therefore, states can bind themselves to other states by\ntreaties and develop some common values with other states. Hence, the\nstructure of the international system is not unchangeable as the\nneorealists claim. It is not a permanent Hobbesian anarchy, permeated\nby the danger of war. An anarchic international system based on pure\npower relations among actors can evolve into a more cooperative and\npeaceful international society, in which state behavior is shaped by\ncommonly shared values and norms. A practical expression of\ninternational society are international organizations that uphold the\nrule of law in international relations, especially the UN.\n",
