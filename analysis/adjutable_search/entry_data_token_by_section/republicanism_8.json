    "main_text": "The Classical Republican Tradition\n3. The Classical Republican Tradition\n\nAfter long-standing neglect among historians of political thought,\nthere has been a dramatic revival of interest in the classical\nrepublican tradition in the past fifty years or so. For the first few\ndecades of this revival, a particular interpretation of that tradition\nprevailed. According to this view, the classical republicans held what\nwould now be described as a perfectionist political\nphilosophy\u2014that is, a political philosophy centered on the idea\nof promoting a specific conception of the good life as consisting in\nactive citizenship and healthy civic virtue on the one hand, while\ncombating any sort of corruption that would undermine these values on\nthe other. This distinctive vision of the good life is supposed to be\nrooted in the experience of the ancient Greek polis, especially as\nexpressed in the writings of Aristotle. The goods of active political\nparticipation, civic virtue, and so on, are to be understood as\nintrinsically valuable components of human flourishing.\n\nIt is now standard to refer to this as the \u2018civic\nhumanist\u2019 interpretation of the classical republican tradition,\nand it is most commonly associated with the writings of Arendt (1958,\n1963), Pocock (1975, 1981), and Rahe (1992). These and other civic\nhumanist writings have left such an impression on the field that even\ntoday many fail to distinguish their views from those of the civic\nrepublicans. As we shall see, however, the two are importantly\ndistinct.\n",
