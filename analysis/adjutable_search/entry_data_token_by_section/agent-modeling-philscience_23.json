To examine why collaborations emerge and when they\nare beneficial, Boyer-Kassem and Imbert (2015) developed a\ncomputational model in which scientists collaborate by sharing\nintermediate results. They study collaborative groups in a larger\ncompetitive community, driven by the priority rule, where\ncollaborators have to equally share the reward for making a discovery.\nTheir simulations suggest that collaborating is beneficial both for\ncommunal and individual inquiry. When scientists collaborate, they\nproceed faster with their inquiry, making it more likely that they\nwill belong to a team that is first to make a discovery. Moreover,\nwhile the scientific community may profit from all scientists fully\ncollaborating (since solutions found by some scientists will be shared\nwith everyone), for individual scientists other collaborative\nconstellations may be better (see also Boyer-Kassem & Imbert\nforthcoming). \n\nTo examine conditions for optimal collaboration Zollman (2017)\nproposed a network-epistemology model. The model starts from the\nassumption that by collaborating scientists teach each other different\nconceptual schemes aimed at solving scientific problems, and that\ncollaboration comes at a cost. His findings suggest that reducing the\ncosts of collaborations and enlarging the size of the collaborative\ngroup benefits those involved, though encouraging scientists to engage\nwith different collaborative groups may not lead to efficient\ninquiry.\n\nWhile the above models studies socially uniform communities, ABMs have\nalso been employed to study socially diverse collaborative\nenvironments and discriminatory patterns that can endogenously emerge\nin them. These models are typically based on evolutionary\ngame-theoretic frameworks examining bargaining norms that accompany\nacademic collaborations (see\n Section 3.4).\n Bruner (2019) initially used this framework to show that in cultural\ninteractions involving a division of resources, minority members can\nbecome disadvantaged merely due to the smaller size of their\n group.[12]\n O\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019) use this approach to study the\nemergence of similar patterns in epistemic communities. The\nsimulations show that minorities can become disadvantaged in\nscientific collaborations due to the size of their group, where the\neffect is increased the smaller their group is. Rubin and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) use a similar framework to examine diversity and\ndiscrimination in epistemic collaboration networks, with a special\nfocus on the role of homophily\u2014the tendency to preferentially\nestablish links with members of one\u2019s own social group in\ncontrast to members of the outgroup. Their results suggest that\ndiscriminatory norms, likely to emerge in academic interaction, may\npromote homophily and decrease social diversity in collaborative\nnetworks. Furthermore, Ventura (2023) shows how inequality can emerge\nin collaboration networks even in the absence of demographic\ncategories since scientists can become disadvantaged merely due to the\nstructure of the collaboration network and their specific position in\nit.\n",
