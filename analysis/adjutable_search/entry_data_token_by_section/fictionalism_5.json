    "main_text": "Some Qualifications and Distinctions || Attitudes\n2.4 Attitudes\n\nThere is also a question of what mental attitude the\nhermeneutic fictionalist about a discourse D should say that\nwe have toward utterances made within D. As the name\n\u201cfictionalism\u201d indicates, the attitude is often said to be\nthe attitude we have toward paradigmatic cases of fiction. (Our\nmotivation for adopting the attitude may be different in paradigmatic\ncases of fiction than in the case of one of the discourses under\nconsideration here. But that is different.) The attitude is also often\nsaid to be that of pretense or make-believe. Those\nwho compare D with make-believe normally rely on the account\nof make-believe of Walton (1990, 1993). Yablo\u2019s (e.g. 1998,\n2001, 2002) brand of hermeneutic fictionalism is one example. The\nYablo-Walton view is usefully divided into two parts. First, the\nstatements made within D are likened to metaphorical\nstatements. Second, a pretense account of metaphor is given.\nOn this type of view on metaphor, a metaphorical utterance is one that\nrepresents the world as it needs to be in order to make the utterance\npretense-worthy in a game of make-believe that it suggests. An example\nmay help. Just as \u201cBert is carrying a gun\u201d can be made\ntrue, in the pretense relevant to this utterance, by Bert\u2019s\nholding a twig, so, on this view on metaphor, can Romeo\u2019s\n\u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d be made true by features of Juliet and\nof the relation between Romeo and Juliet, given the pretense that\nRomeo\u2019s utterance makes relevant. For example, the utterance may\nbe made true by Juliet\u2019s bearing the right type of real-world\nrelation to Romeo\u2019s well-being. (See Wearing 2012 for criticism\nof this kind of view on metaphor.)\n\nClearly there are views between the extreme fictionalist view that\nD is best given a metaphor/pretense account and the extreme\nrealist view that ordinary assertions within D aim at literal\ntruth. (i) Van Fraassen (1980), discussing scientific discourse,\nemphasizes that our attitude toward our best theory of the world is,\nor should be, \u2018acceptance\u2019 rather than belief, where\nacceptance is an attitude that falls short of belief. (ii) Yablo\n(2006) has investigated the possibility that when engaging in\nmathematical discourse we presuppose that mathematical\nentities exist. (And while it is possible to assimilate presupposition\nto pretense such an assimilation is not part of Yablo\u2019s official\nstory.) Compare here also Hinckfuss (1993). (iii) A suggestion\ndeveloped in Eklund (2005) is that when it comes to a variety of\nsentences we use, we are often simply indifferent to some\nimplications of what they express: the fictionalist can appeal to this\nand say that we are indifferent to the real-world existential\nimplications of mathematical statements. (iv) Walton (1990) himself\ninsists that even if he is giving a pretense account, the claim is not\nthat speakers themselves actively engage in pretense. For a\npretense account to be correct of the utterances of some given\nspeaker, it is enough that the speaker participates in a pretense\ndiscourse. Compare here also Crimmins\u2019 (1998) remarks on\n\u201cshallow pretense\u201d. Crimmins emphasizes that, despite his\ntalk of pretense, \u201cwe are instituting a manner of speaking, not\npainting a fantasy world\u201d. Which of these theses to call\n\u201cfictionalist\u201d is a matter of terminological choice. But\narguably, all the theses on the list share the main attractions of\nparadigmatic versions of fictionalism.\n",
