    "main_text": "Requirements of Structural Rationality || Synchronic vs. Diachronic Requirements\n2.2 Synchronic vs. Diachronic Requirements\n\nAs we have discussed them so far, structural requirements do not index\nattitude-states to time points and are thus open to two\ninterpretations. On the synchronic interpretation, all the\nattitude-states are indexed to the same point in time, while on a\ndiachronic interpretation, the attitude-states are indexed to\ndifferent time points or periods. For example, the narrow-scope\nenkratic requirement (\u00a72.1) may be understood in either of the\nfollowing ways:\n\nEnkratic requirement, narrow-scope + synchronic: If \\(A\\)\nbelieves at \\(t\\) that she ought to \\(\\Phi\\), rationality requires\n\\(A\\) to intend at \\(t\\) to \\(\\Phi\\).\n\nEnkratic requirement, narrow-scope + diachronic: If \\(A\\)\nbelieves at \\(t_1\\) that she ought to \\(\\Phi\\), rationality requires\n\\(A\\) to intend at \\(t_2\\) to \\(\\Phi\\).\n\nThe literature contains two kinds of arguments for the diachronic\napproach. The first is that only diachronic requirements can guide our\nreasoning going forward (Schroeder 2004; Kolodny 2005). The second is\nthat synchronic requirements cannot accommodate \u201crational\ndelay\u201d \u2013 the assumption that limited beings like us are\nnot rationally criticizable for taking time to adjust their attitudes\nto new circumstances and establish coherence (Kiesewetter 2017:\n62\u201370; Podgorski 2017).\n\nHowever, it is difficult to spell out diachronic requirements. An\nimportant challenge for any diachronic approach is to specify the\nrelation between \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\). A possible view is that \\(t_2\\)\nis just any time after \\(t_1\\), perhaps even including \\(t_1\\) (Lord\n2014). While this might speak to the guidance-related argument for the\ndiachronic account, it does not seem appropriate as a response to the\nphenomenon of rational delay. And since the length of rational delay\nappears to depend on particular circumstances and individual\nabilities, there is reason to be skeptical that there could be a\nprincipled specification of diachronic requirements that accounts for\nrational delay.\n\nMoreover, if one is persuaded that the wide-scope approach is superior\nto the narrow-scope approach, there are further problems for the\ndiachronic approach, as it is debatable whether the diachronic\napproach is consistent with the spirit of the wide-scope approach.\nConsider:\n\nEnkratic requirement, wide-scope + diachronic: Rationality\nrequires \\(A\\) to (not-believe at \\(t_1\\) that she ought to \\(\\Phi\\)\nor intend at \\(t_2\\) to \\(\\Phi)\\).\n\nIf \\(A\\) believes at \\(t_1\\) that she ought to \\(\\Phi\\), then at\n\\(t_2\\) intending to \\(\\Phi\\) is the only way in which \\(A\\) can\nsatisfy this requirement. Thus, a requirement to adopt this intention\ncan plausibly be detached (Broome 2013). This violates the spirit of\nthe wide-scope approach. While other ways of spelling out diachronic\nwide-scope requirements have been proposed, it remains controversial\nwhether they can preserve symmetry and non-detachability without\ncollapsing into their synchronic counterparts (Lord 2014; Reisner\n2009; Kiesewetter 2017: 58\u201369; Worsnip 2021: 183\u20137).\n\nWhile there is considerable disagreement about whether all structural\nrequirements are diachronic, it is somewhat less controversial that\nthere are at least some essentially diachronic requirements of\nrationality \u00ad\u2013 for example, requirements of attitude\npersistence that prohibit abandoning beliefs or intentions\narbitrarily (Broome 2013; Bratman 2018; Brunero 2022). However, at\nleast in the doxastic realm, some authors have argued that there are\nno diachronic requirements at all (Hedden 2015; Moss 2015).\n",
