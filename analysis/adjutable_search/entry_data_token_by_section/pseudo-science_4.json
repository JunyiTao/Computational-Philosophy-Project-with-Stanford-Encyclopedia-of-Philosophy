There are phenomena that satisfy both criteria but are\nnot commonly called pseudoscientific. One of the clearest examples of\nthis is fraud in science. This is a practice that has a high degree of\nscientific pretence and yet does not comply with science, thus\nsatisfying both criteria. Nevertheless, fraud in otherwise legitimate\nbranches of science is seldom if ever called\n\u201cpseudoscience\u201d. The reason for this can be clarified with\nthe following hypothetical examples (Hansson 1996).\n\nCase 1: A biochemist performs an experiment that she\ninterprets as showing that a particular protein has an essential\nrole in muscle contraction. There is a consensus among her\ncolleagues that the result is a mere artefact, due to experimental\nerror.\n\n\nCase 2: A biochemist goes on performing one sloppy experiment\nafter the other. She consistently interprets them as showing that a\nparticular protein has a role in muscle contraction not accepted\nby other scientists.\n\n\nCase 3: A biochemist performs various sloppy experiments in\ndifferent areas. One is the experiment referred to in case 1. Much of\nher work is of the same quality. She does not propagate any particular\nunorthodox theory.\n\n\nAccording to common usage, 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad\nscience, and only 2 as a case of pseudoscience. What is present in\ncase 2, but absent in the other two, is a deviant doctrine.\nIsolated breaches of the requirements of science are not commonly\nregarded as pseudoscientific. Pseudoscience, as it is commonly\nconceived, involves a sustained effort to promote standpoints\ndifferent from those that have scientific legitimacy at the time.\n\nThis explains why fraud in science is not usually regarded as\npseudoscientific. Such practices are not in general associated with a\ndeviant or unorthodox doctrine. To the contrary, the fraudulent\nscientist is usually anxious that her results be in conformity with\nthe predictions of established scientific theories. Deviations from\nthese would lead to a much higher risk of disclosure.\n\nThe term \u201cscience\u201d has both an individuated and an\nunindividuated sense. In the individuated sense, biochemistry and\nastronomy are different sciences, one of which includes studies of\nmuscle proteins and the other studies of supernovae. The Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary (OED) defines this sense of science as \u201ca\nparticular branch of knowledge or study; a recognized department of\nlearning\u201d. In the unindividuated sense, the study of muscle\nproteins and that of supernovae are parts of \u201cone and the\nsame\u201d science. In the words of the OED, unindividuated science\nis \u201cthe kind of knowledge or intellectual activity of which the\nvarious \u2018sciences\u2018 are examples\u201d.\n\nPseudoscience is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather\nthan the unindividuated sense. There is no unified corpus of\npseudoscience corresponding to the corpus of science. For a phenomenon\nto be pseudoscientific, it must belong to one or the other of the\nparticular pseudosciences. In order to accommodate this feature, the\nabove definition can be modified by replacing (2) by the following\n(Hansson 1996):\n\n(2\u2032)\nit is part of a non-scientific doctrine whose major proponents\ntry to create the impression that it is scientific. \n\n\nMost philosophers of science, and most scientists, prefer to regard\nscience as constituted by methods of inquiry rather than by particular\ndoctrines. There is an obvious tension between (2\u2032) and this\nconventional view of science. This, however, may be as it should since\npseudoscience often involves a representation of science as a closed\nand finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open-ended\ninquiry.\n",
