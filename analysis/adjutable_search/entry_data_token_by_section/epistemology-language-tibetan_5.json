    "main_text": "Philosophy of language || The object of words\n3.1 The object of words\n\nLanguage is dealt with in Tibetan epistemological treatises in terms\nof the relationship between \u201cwhat expresses\u201d (rjod\nbyed) and \u201cwhat is expressed\u201d (brjod\nbya)\u2014two notions that come quite close to the Saussurian\ndistinction between \u201csignifier\u201d and\n\u201csignified.\u201d\n\nAccording to the basic presuppositions of Buddhist ontology,\n\u201cwords\u201d consist in singular sound emissions uttered at a\nspecific place and time, and the \u201cobjects\u201d that are\ninteracted with as a consequence of language use are momentary and\nunique particulars. Although words and objects appear to be what\nexpresses and what is expressed, the success of language cannot rely\non a relation between particular words and particular objects, for\nthis would not provide the generalizability necessary for language to\nhave any practical utility. Particular words express particular\nobjects only in virtue of the conventional relation established,\nwithin a linguistic community, between generic words and meanings.\n\nAccordingly, Tibetan models distinguish between (i) a \u201cdirect\nsignifier\u201d and a \u201cdirectly signified\u201d\u2014a\ngeneric word (sgra spyi) and a generic object, identified as\na \u201cdon spyi\u201d (the term was previously translated\nas \u201cconcept\u201d when discussing the apprehended object of\nconceptual cognition)\u2014and (ii) a \u201cconceived\nsignifier\u201d and a \u201cconceived signified,\u201d the\nparticular sound emission and the particular object.\n\n\n(i)\n direct signifier\n\n(dngos kyi rjod byed = sgra spyi)\ndirectly signified\n\n(dngos kyi brjod bya = don spyi/sgra don) \n\n(ii)\nconceived signifier\n\n(zhen pa\u02bci rjod byed = sgra [rang gi mtshan nyid])\nconceived signified\n\n(zhen pa\u02bci brjod bya = don [rang gi mtshan nyid])\n\n\n\nThere are two main issues with this model, one is the relation between\nthe direct signifier and signified and the conceived ones, the other\nis the understanding of what is the \u201cdirectly\nsignified.\u201d\n\n(a) The question of establishing relations between generic words and\nmeaning whereas there exist, in reality, only particular sound\nutterances and objects, and the question of interaction with these\nparticulars relying on generic words and meanings echo the issue\nalready met with in the context of conceptual processes and actions\nrelying on them, namely, bridging the gap between the conceptual realm\nand reality. The expression \u201cconceived\u201d (zhen pa)\nis here also indicative of a process of intentional determination that\ninvolves the mistaken identification of the conceptual fiction with\nextra-mental reality. Sakya Pandita distinguishes the context of\n\u201cexplanation,\u201d where one differentiates between\n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cconceived\u201d signifier and\nsignified, between generic and specific words and objects, and the\ncontext of \u201caction,\u201d that is, practical language use. In\nthe context of \u201caction\u201d\u2014this includes\nconvention-setting and application of conventions\u2014these\ndifferences are blurred for speakers and hearers. The double\narticulation of the conceptual and reality thus holds together thanks\nto spontaneous mistaken identifications that take place while learning\nand applying linguistic conventions.\n\nThe divergences discussed in the section on universals between\nantirealists and moderate realists are reflected when it comes to\nlanguage: while antirealists hold that language, just like conceptual\nthought, merely deals with fictions, moderate realists argue that\nlanguage captures real features of the world, even if only in a\ndistorted fashion. They thereby admit real properties shared by\ndiscrete instances. These properties are (due to commentarial\nrequirements) presented in negative terms, as \u201cobjective\nexclusions.\u201d For later Gelukpa authors, the \u201cnot being\nnon-x\u201d (some authors do not bother with the double negation)\nshared by several instances is the main object of the convention,\nwhile the corresponding concept, the don spyi, is its\nsecondary object.\n\nFor a justification of the success of language, antirealists can\nappeal to the theory of apoha and the explanation involving\ncausality in concept formation. Indeed, words reflect conceptual\ndistinctions that can also be understood as constructed universals;\nlanguage can only occur within a system of concepts. In\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s system, which is here presupposed, words are\nassociated via conventions not with an object, but with a\n\u201cdistinction\u201d which requires a bipartition of particulars\nin two complementary domains. A word can be associated to this\ndistinction of xs from non-xs at the time of an\nagreement. Subsequently, any use of an utterance that is a token of\nthis word indicates nothing else than the elimination of\nnon-xs, but can lead to obtain a particular excluded from\nnon-xs. The causal process involved in the process of concept\nformation is what ensures success, provided that conventions are\nestablished and learned successfully.\n\n(b) The identification of the \u201cdirectly signified\u201d prompts\ndivergences among Tibetan scholars.\n\nFor authors who accept that conceptual cognition has an apprehended\nobject, this object (the concept [don spyi]) is also what is\ndirectly signified by a word. A word utterance triggers the emergence\nof such an appearing object in the mind of the hearer. The distinction\nbetween \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cconceived\u201d signified\nsupports a distinction between sense and reference. Distinct words\ntrigger the emergence of distinct \u201cgeneric\nobjects\u201d\u2014there are distinct \u201cdirectly\nsignified.\u201d The corresponding \u201cconceived signified\u201d\ncan be distinct as well (for instance for the emergence of the generic\nobjects \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cpillar\u201d) or the same (for\ninstance a particular blue pot is the conceived signified for both the\ngeneric objects \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d). Some\nauthors of the pre-classical period contend that some distinct\nwords\u2014true synonyms\u2014generate the apparition of the same\ngeneric object, thus parting with the ultra-intensionality that reigns\nin Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s system, where each word is ascribed a\nunique way of excluding something from what it is not.\n\nNote that the generic object is not unanimously accepted as the\nsignified even among authors that admit that it is the apprehended\nobject of conceptual awareness. Chumikpa for instance prescribes as\nsignified \u201ca generic object mixed with a generic word.\u201d\nAccordingly, what appears in conceptual cognition upon hearing a\nparticular word is a mixed aspect of the corresponding generic word\nand generic object. The extra-mental entity is obtained via an\noperation of determination pertaining to the generic object, which is\nthe apprehended object of conceptual awareness.\n\nThat conceptual cognitions have an apprehended object is not admitted\nby all Tibetan scholars, and, as seen above, is criticized in\nparticular by Sakya Pandita. The latter nevertheless adopts the same\nbasic linguistic model as his predecessors, using for the\n\u201cdirectly signified\u201d the more Dharmak\u012brtian\nexpression \u201cverbal object\u201d (Tib. sgra don, Skt.\n\u015babd\u0101rtha) alternatively to the expressions\n\u201cgeneric object\u201d (don spyi). However, the point\nof contention discussed in the context of the threefold typology of\nobjects re-emerges, as this author insists that such a signifier\nactually does not exist (it is not a causally efficient particular)\nand is not even properly speaking an \u201cobject.\u201d Still Sakya\nPandita adopts, phenomenologically speaking, a view that is quite\nsimilar to the one he criticizes: while his opponents speak of a\n\u201cgeneric object appearing to conceptual awareness,\u201d Sakya\nPandita accepts that there is the emergence of an \u201cimage\u201d\nor \u201creflection\u201d (Tib. gzugs brnyan, Skt.\npratibimba/pratibh\u0101) in conceptual thought. But\nas far as meaning is concerned, Sakya Pandita holds the more radical\nview that words actually do not signify anything: a word does not have\nany object, because nothing qualifies as such. One can speak, but only\nmetaphorically, of the extra-mental particular as being\n\u201csignified\u201d insofar as it is what one obtains when acting\nupon the determination in which generic and specific, conceptual and\nreal, are confused. This extra-mental particular alone can provide the\nbasis for intersubjective agreement about the object of words. The\ngeneric object could not play this role: being private, it would in\nany case not be able to play any epistemic role.\n\nThis model is constructed as a way to bridge the gap between\nconceptual processes and reality, and, consequently, focuses on\nlanguage use in transactional usage involving real entities. If the\nuse of words expressing non-entities can be accounted for, it however\nturns out to be problematic, in a model where meaning is only acquired\nindirectly through a mistaken process of conflating a conceptual\nfiction and reality, to talk about abstract entities, such as first-\nor second-order properties. For instance, the word \u201cred\u201d\ncould only acquire a meaning in the sense of a red particular, i.e.,\nas \u201csomething red,\u201d but not as the \u201cproperty\nred.\u201d As a consequence, heterological predicates are ruled out,\nfor both the word for the subject and the word for the property are\nrelated to the same particular in the process of mistaken\nidentification with an extra-mental entity. For instance, expressing\nthe idea that \u201c(the particular) sound is audible but (the\nproperty) audible is not audible\u201d would be problematic if\n\u201caudible\u201d only means \u201cwhat is audible.\u201d In\ncontrast, advocates of concepts being the apprehended object of\nconceptual cognition can account for metalinguistic discussions by\nkeeping open the possibility that, via the operation of intentional\ndetermination, the concept is conceived as a concept (and not\nsystematically as an extra-mental particular).\n",
