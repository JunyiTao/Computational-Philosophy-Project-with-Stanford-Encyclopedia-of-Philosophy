    "main_text": "Probability in the Renaissance\n6. Preview of early modern and modern probability\n\nMedieval and Renaissance notions of probability largely derived from\nthe same ancient sources and remained related to each other through\ninterchanges between scholastics and humanists. Yet soon after 1500,\npre-modern probability discourse began to assume a new shape. Although\nthe many differences between medieval and early modern scholastic and\nhumanist uses of \u201cthe probable\u201d cannot be summarized here,\nthey should not be underestimated. Above all, at the end of the\nsixteenth century, the Aristotelian endoxon gave way in moral\ntheology to a two-tiered definition of probability as either intrinsic\n(based on known reasons) or extrinsic (based on the opinions of\nothers). How much such innovations fostered the rise of numerical\nprobability in the middle of the seventeenth century is still largely\nan open question. Knebel (2000) and Schuessler (2019) show that it is\nreasonable to assume a significant contribution by early modern\nscholasticism. Maryks (2008) claims that the humanist precedent\nprompted the Jesuits to introduce the distinction between internal and\nexternal probability. At present, however, the cross-pollinations\nbetween early modern humanism and scholasticism are scarcely better\nunderstood than the developments leading to the invention of numerical\nprobability.\n\nIn any case, the notions of probability of many philosophers, from\nDescartes and Locke to Kant, recognizably rely on a stock of meanings\nwith roots in Renaissance humanism and medieval scholasticism. The\nphilosophers in question deviated notably from this stock, but so did\ntheir scholastic contemporaries. The modernization of probability\ntherefore occurred along a broad front of schools, trends and\ntraditions in the seventeenth century. It is instructive to relate the\nfour medieval concepts of probability listed above to their modern\nsuccessors. On the modern side, three major groups of interpretations\nor concepts of probability have emerged (H\u00e1jek 2011):\n\nquasi-logical approaches: probability as a measure of objective\nevidential support;\ndegree-of-confidence or degree-of-belief approaches: probability\nas a measure of subjective graded belief or confidence;\nfeature-of-the-world approaches: probability as a measure for\nundetermined features of the world.\n\n\nThe first category mainly contains classical and logical concepts of\n probability.[48]\n Classical concepts define probability through the equal possibility\nof states of affairs. Logical concepts focus on evidential support for\nthe truth of propositions. The most prominent variants of the second\ncategory are Bayesian theories of probability and mathematical\nrepresentations of subjective expectation. The last category comprises\nfrequentist and propensity interpretations of\n probability.[49]\n For frequentists, probability is the limit of a relative frequency in\na series of events; for the propensity view, it is an irreducible\nfeature of the physical world.\n\nMedieval notions of probability exhibit parallels to all modern groups\nof probability concepts. Endoxic and juridical probability are species\nof quasi-logical probability because they arise from evidential\nsupport for holding a proposition true. Endoxa, that is,\nprobable opinions of others, are evidence for holding a proposition\ntrue. The witness testimony and indicia of juridical notions\nof probability are also, of course, kinds of evidence. The second\ncategory of modern interpretations of probability is related to\nmedieval probability understood as a specific amount of confidence in\nthe truth of a proposition. It is the confidence that characterizes\nopinions as the lowest rank of an epistemological order leading via\nfides (standing for fully confident belief or faith) to\nknowledge. Finally, probability is a feature of the world in modern\npropensity views, as well as for the medieval semantic notion of\nprobability. Whether this also holds for proto-frequentist probability\nis, as indicated, a matter of interpretation.\n\nConspicuously lacking in the period from 1200\u20131500 is an\nancestor of the \u201cclassical\u201d notion of probability,\ngrounded on the equal possibility of events. This, then, seems to be a\ngenuinely modern interpretation of\n probability.[50]\n",
