    "main_text": "Virtue || Appropriate and Correct Action\n4.1 Appropriate and Correct Action\n\nThe Stoic distinction between valuable and good things is at the\ncenter of Seneca\u2019s Letters. So-called preferred\nindifferents\u2014health, wealth, and so on\u2014have value\n(their opposites, dispreferred indifferents, have disvalue).\nBut only virtue is good. Again and again, Seneca discusses\nhow health and wealth do not contribute to our happiness. Seneca\napproaches this issue not as an academic puzzle, as if we needed to be\ncompelled by intricate proof to accept this point. He speaks very\ndirectly to his readers, and his examples grip us moderns as much as\nthey gripped his contemporaries. We tend to think that life would be\nbetter if only we did not have to travel for the lowest fare, but in a\nmore comfortable fashion; we are disheartened when our provisions for\ndinner are no better than stale bread. By addressing these very\nconcrete situations, Seneca keeps hammering home the core claim of\nStoic ethics: that virtue alone is sufficient for happiness, and\nnothing else even makes a contribution. It is important to note that\npreferred indifferents have value though they are not good in the\nterminological sense of the Stoics. Scholars sometimes suggest that,\nfor Seneca, preferred indifferents are worthless and to be frowned\nupon (for example, Braund 2009). In doing so, they pick up on the\nmetaphors and examples that Seneca employs. Seneca writes with an\nacute awareness of how difficult it is not to see things like health\nand wealth as good, and that is, as contributing to one\u2019s\nhappiness. Accordingly, Seneca keeps giving vivid examples, aiming to\nhelp his audience become less attached to things of mere value.\nHowever, he does not suggest that things like health or wealth should\nbe regarded dismissively, or not taken care of.\n\nA related and equally important aspect of Stoic ethics is the\ndistinction between appropriate and correct action.\nAppropriate action takes indifferents adequately into account. Both\nfools and the wise can act appropriately. But only the wise act\nperfectly appropriately, or correctly: their action\nis based on their perfect deliberation, and reflects the overall\nconsistency of their soul. Seneca explains matters in precisely this\nfashion: while we should take indifferents (health, illness, wealth,\npoverty, etc.) judiciously into account, as things of value or\ndisvalue to us, the good does not reside in getting or avoiding them.\nWhat is good is that I choose well (Letter\n92.11\u201312). In response to the question \u2018What is\nvirtue?\u2019, Seneca says \u201ca true and immovable\njudgment\u201d (Letter 71.32; tr. Inwood). Attributing any\nreal importance to indifferents, Seneca argues, is like preferring,\namong two good men, the one with the fancy haircut (Letter\n66.25). This comparison is typical for Seneca\u2019s tendency to\ncapture the standing of valuable indifferents in forceful, figurative\nlanguage. A nice haircut, one might think, could be seen as entirely\nirrelevant. But this is not Seneca\u2019s point. Compared to the\ngood, preferred indifferents pale, and appear as insignificant as a\nfashionable haircut when compared with genuine virtue. But preferred\nindifferents are valuable. In deliberation, we do not compare them\nwith the good; we consider them next to dispreferred indifferents.\n\nIn appropriate action, the agent takes things of value into account.\nThis, however, does not happen in the abstract\u2014she does not\nweigh the value of wealth against the value of health in a general\nfashion. Rather, she thinks about the way in which a specific\nsituation and the courses of action available in it involve\nindifferents\u2014for example, putting on the appropriate clothes for\na given occasion (Letter 92.11). Since the features of the\nsituation in which one acts thus matter to appropriate action, the\nStoics apparently wrote treatises (now lost) in which they discussed\nat length how this or that feature may bear on what one should be\ndoing (Sedley 2001). Seneca\u2019s Letters 94 and 95 seem to\nbe examples of this kind of treatise. The very fact that such\ntreatises are written testifies to the fact that indifferents are not\nsimply irrelevant: they are the material of deliberation.\n\nSince Kidd (1978), Letters 94 and 95 have been read with a\nview to the question of whether rules figure in Stoic ethics (for a\ndiscussion of the letters that is not framed by this question, see I.\nHadot 1969, 8\u20139). This question, in turn, is relevant to our\ninterpretation of the Stoic conception of law. The Stoics have long\nbeen considered the ancestors of the natural law tradition (Striker\n1987). If the Stoics formulate rule-like precepts, then perhaps this\nmeans that the law, as the Stoics understand it, consists of a set of\nlaws.\n\nIn Letters 94 and 95, Seneca discusses two notions,\npraecepta and decreta, usually translated as\n\u2018precepts\u2019 and \u2018principles\u2019. The topic of\nSeneca\u2019s discussion is this. If we seek a good life by studying\nphilosophy, do we need to study only decreta, or also\npraecepta? According to the first position, the only thing\nneeded to achieve virtue is to immerse oneself in the core tenets of\nStoic philosophy. It is these that Seneca calls decreta;\ndecreta thus are not practical principles or rules. They are\nprinciples of philosophy, in the sense of being the most abstract and\nfundamental teachings of the Stoics.\n\nAccording to the second position, which Seneca seems to endorse,\nstudying the first principles of Stoic philosophy is not sufficient;\nwe should also think in detail about the demands that specific\nsituations in life might make on us (and so, we should study\npraecepta relating to them). It may seem that these\nlower-level considerations involve rules: in such-and-such a\nsituation, one should act in such-and-such a way (Annas 1993, 98-105;\nMitsis 2001). However, it is not clear whether Seneca indeed envisages\nsuch rules. As students of virtue, we will benefit from thinking our\nway through a variety of situations that one might encounter in life,\ncontemplating how the different features of these situations matter to\nappropriate action, and so developing a sharpened sense of the\nparticular value of the various things that do have value or disvalue\nfor a human being. Seneca\u2019s \u2018case studies\u2019 (e.g., a\npreviously married wife should be treated differently from a\npreviously unmarried wife) perhaps only hone the students\u2019\nappreciation for the kinds of issues that matter to appropriate\naction, where different things of value or disvalue impinge case by\ncase, rather than providing them with rules for specific situations.\nFurther, Seneca envisages an advisor who reminds us of insights such\nas \u2018money does not bring happiness\u2019. Such almost\nproverbial sayings, however, do not appear to be rules. Finally, the\nadvisor is someone who can come up with specific advice for a given\noccasion, such as \u2018walk in such-and-such a way\u2019 (see\nOn Favors 15.2; Inwood 2005 [4]; Schafer 2009, esp. regarding\nLetters 94 and 95; Vogt 2007, 189\u2013198). As Seneca\nemphasizes in Letter 71.1, advice is adjusted to situations,\nand situations are in flux. If one needs advice, one is not asking to\nbe told the correct rule to cover the situation; one is asking how to\nbalance various considerations.\n",
