    "main_text": "\n\nHuman consciousness usually displays a striking unity. When one\nexperiences a noise and, say, a pain, one is not conscious of the\nnoise and then, separately, of the pain. One is conscious of the noise\nand pain together, as aspects of a single conscious experience. Since\nat least the time of Immanuel Kant (1781/7), this phenomenon has been\ncalled the unity of consciousness. More generally, it is\nconsciousness not of A and, separately, of B and,\nseparately, of C, but of\nA-and-B-and-C together, as the contents of\na single conscious state.\n\nHistorically, the notion of the unity of consciousness has played a\nvery large role in thought about the mind. Indeed, as we will see, it\nfigured centrally in some of the most influential arguments about the\nmind from the time of Descartes to the 20th century. In the\nearly part of the 20th century, the notion largely\ndisappeared for a time, but since the 1960s, analytic philosophers and\nothers have begun to pay attention to it again.\n",
