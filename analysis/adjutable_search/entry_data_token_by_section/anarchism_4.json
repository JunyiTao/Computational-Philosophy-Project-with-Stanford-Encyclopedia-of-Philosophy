    "main_text": "Varieties of Anarchism || Applied Anarchism\n1.4 Applied Anarchism\n\nThe broad critical framework provided by the anarchist critique of\nauthority provides a useful theory or methodology for social critique.\nIn more recent iterations, anarchism has been used to critique gender\nhierarchies, racial hierarchies, and the like\u2014also including a\ncritique of human domination over nature. Thus anarchism also\nincludes, to name a few varieties: anarcha-feminism or feminist\nanarchism (see Kornegger 1975), queer anarchism or anarchist queer\ntheory (see Daring et al. 2010), green anarchism or eco-anarchism also\nassociated with anarchist social ecology (see Bookchin 1971 [1986]),\nBlack and indigenous anarchisms and other anarchist critiques of white\nsupremacy and Eurocentrism (to be discussed below); and even\nanarcho-veganism or \u201cveganarchism\u201d (see Nocella, White,\n& Cudworth 2015). In the anarcho-vegan literature we find the\nfollowing description of a broad and inclusive anarchism:\n\n\nAnarchism is a socio-political theory which opposes all systems of\ndomination and oppression such as racism, ableism, sexism,\nanti-LGBTTQIA, ageism, sizeism, government, competition, capitalism,\ncolonialism, imperialism and punitive justice, and promotes direct\ndemocracy, collaboration, interdependence, mutual aid, diversity,\npeace, transformative justice and equity. (Nocella et al. 2015: 7)\n\n\nA thorough-going anarchism would thus offer a critique of anything and\neverything that smacks of hierarchy, domination, centralization, and\nunjustified authority.\n\nAnarchists who share these various commitments often act upon their\ncritique of authority by engaging in nonconformist practices (free\nlove, nudism, gender disruption, and so on) or by forming intentional\ncommunities that live \u201coff the grid\u201d and outside of the\nnorms of mainstream culture. In extreme forms this becomes\nanarcho-primitivism or anti-civilizational anarchism (see Zerzan 2008,\n2010; Jensen 2006). Alternative anarchist societies have existed in\nreligious communes in post-Reformation Europe and in the early United\nStates, in Nineteenth Century American utopian communities, the hippy\ncommunes of the Twentieth Century, anarchist squats, temporary\nautonomous zones (see Bey 1985), and occasional gatherings of\nlike-minded people.\n\nGiven this sort of antinomianism and non-conformism it is easy to see\nthat anarchism also often includes a radical critique of traditional\nethical norms and principles. Thus radical ethical anarchism can be\ncontrasted with what we might call bourgeois anarchism (with radical\nanarchism seeking to disrupt traditional social norms and bourgeois\nanarchism seeking freedom from the state that does not seek such\ndisruption). And although some argue that anarchists are deeply\nethical\u2014committed to liberty and solidarity\u2014others will\nargue that anarchists are moral nihilists who reject morality entirely\nor who at least reject the idea that there could be a single source of\nmoral authority (see essays in Franks & Wilson 2010).\n\nIn more recent explorations and applications of anarchist thought, the\nanarchist critique has been related and connected to a variety of\nemerging theoretical issues and applied concerns. Hilary Lazar (2018)\nfor example, explores how anarchism connects to intersectionality and\nissues related to multiculturalism. And Sky Croeser (2019) explores\nhow anarchism is connected to the emerging technologies including the\nInternet. And there are anarchist elements in the development of\nshared technological and information, as for example in the\ndevelopment of cryptocurrencies, which create economies that outside\nof traditional state-based economic systems.\n",
