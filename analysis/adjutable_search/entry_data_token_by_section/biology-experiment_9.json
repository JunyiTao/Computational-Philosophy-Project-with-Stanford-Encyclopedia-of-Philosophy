    "main_text": "Experimental Artifacts and Data Reliability || Robustness\n5.1 Robustness\n\nUnder what conditions should scientists trust experimental data that\nsupport some theoretical conclusion such as, for example, that DNA has\na helical structure or that mitochondria are bounded by two layers of\nmembrane? This is known as the problem of \u201cdata\nreliability\u201d. Unreliable data are commonly referred to as\n\u201cexperimental artifacts\u201d in biology, indicating their\nstatus as being \u201cmade\u201d by the experimental procedure. This\nis somewhat misleading, as all data\u2014whether they are reliable or\nartifacts\u2014are made by the experimental procedure. The difference\nis that reliable data are correct representations of an underlying\nreality, whereas so-called artifacts are incorrect representations.\nThis characterization assumes that data have some sort of\nrepresentational content; they represent an object as\ninstantiating some property or properties; (see Van Fraassen 2008, Ch.\n6\u20137). The question of what it means for data to represent their\nobject correctly has not been much discussed in this context. The\nfocus so far has been mostly on various strategies for checking data\nfor reliability, which will be discussed below. As for scientists\nthemselves, they tend to place this problem under the rubric of\nreplicability. While this is also an important topic, the fact that\nsome data are replicable is not sufficient for their reliability.\nThere are lots of well-known examples of perfectly replicable data\nthat turned out to be not reliable, e.g., the case of the mesosome to\nbe discussed below.\n\nOne of the more influential ideas in philosophy of science is that of\nrobustness. Originally, the term was introduced to denote a certain\nproperty of theoretical models, namely insensitivity to modeling\nassumptions. A robust result in theoretical modeling is a result that\nis invariant with respect to variations in modeling assumptions\n(Levins 1966; Wimsatt 1981; Weisberg 2006). In experimental science,\nthe term means something else, namely that a result is invariant with\nrespect to the use of different experimental methods. Robust\nexperimental results are results that somehow agree even although they\nhave been produced by independent methods. The independence of methods\ncan mean at least two things: First, the methods use different\nphysical processes. For example, a light microscope and a\n(transmission) electron microscope are independent methods in this\nsense; the former uses visible light, the latter an electron beam to\ngather information about biological structures. The second sense of\nindependence concerns the theoretical assumptions used to analyze and\ninterpret the data (most data are theory-dependent). If these\nassumptions are different for the two methods, they are also referred\nto as independent, or as independently theory-dependent (Culp 1995).\nThese two senses of \u201cindependent\u201d usually coincide,\nalthough there could be exceptions.\n\nA much-discussed example of a robust experimental result from the\nphysical sciences is the numerical value obtained for Avogadro\u2019s\nnumber (6.022 x 1023) at the beginning of the 20th Century\nby using no less than thirteen independent methods according to the\nphysicist Jean Perrin (Nye 1972). Salmon (1984) has argued that this\nprovided a strong justification for belief in the existence of atoms\nby way of a common-cause argument. On Salmon\u2019s view, the existence of\natoms can be inferred as the common cause of Perrin\u2019s thirteen\ndifferent determinations of Avogadro\u2019s number. Others have construed\nrobustness arguments more along the lines of Putnam\u2019s \u201cno\nmiracle\u201d argument for scientific realism, according to which the\nassumption of the reality of some theoretical entities is the best\nexplanation for the predictive success of theories or, in the case of\nrobustness, for the agreement of experimental results (Weber 2005, Ch.\n8; Stegenga 2009).\n\nVarious authors have tried to show that robustness-based reasoning\nplays an important role in judgments about data reliability in\nexperimental biology. For example, Weber (1998b) argues that the\ncoincidence of genetic maps of Drosophila produced by\ndifferent mapping techniques provided an important argument for the\nfidelity of these maps in the 1930s. Culp (1995) argued that\nrobustness provides a way out of a methodological conundrum know as\n\u201cdata-technique circles\u201d, which is a more apt designation\nfor Collins\u2019 \u201cexperimenter\u2019s regress\u201d. According to\nCollins (1985), scientists must trust data on the grounds of their\nbeing produced by a reliable instrument, but they can only judge an\ninstrument to be reliable on the basis of it\u2019s producing the right\nkind of data. According to Culp (1995), robustness provides a way out\nof this circle. If the data obtained by independent methods agree,\nthen this supports both the reliability of these data and of the\ninstrument that produced these data. She attempts to demonstrate this\non the example of different methods of DNA sequencing.\n\nStegenga (2009) criticizes the approach from robustness. On his view,\nwhat he calls \u201cmulti-modal evidence\u201d, i.e., evidence\nobtained by different techniques, is often discordant. If it is\nconcordant, it is difficult to judge if the different methods are\nreally independent. However, Stegenga (2009) does not discuss Culp\u2019s\n(1995) example of DNA sequencing, which seems to be a case where\nevidence obtained by different sequencing techniques is often\nconcordant. Furthermore, Culp shows that the techniques are\nindependent in the sense that they are based both on different\nbiochemical processes and different theoretical assumptions.\n\nA historical case that has been extensively discussed is the case of\nthe hapless mesosome. For more than 20 years (ca. 1960\u20131983),\nthis was thought to be a membrane-bound structure inside bacterial\ncells, not unlike the nucleus or the mitochondria of the cells of\nhigher organisms. However, it could only be seen in electron\nmicroscopy (bacterial cells being too small for light microscopy).\nBecause electron microscopy requires a vacuum, biological samples\nrequire a lot of preparation. Cells must be chemically fixed, which\nwas done mostly by using Osmium tetroxide at the time. Furthermore,\nthe samples must be protected from the effects of freezing water. For\nthis purpose, cryoprotectants such as glycol must be used. Finally,\nthe material must be cut into extremely thin slices, as an electron\nbeam does not have much penetrating power. Electron microscopists used\ntwo different techniques: The first involved embedding the cells in a\nraisin before cutting with very sharp knives (so-called microtomes).\nThe other technique used fast freezing followed by fracturing the\ncells along their membranes. At first, mesosomes were seen in electron\nmicrographs under a variety of conditions, but then there were\nincreasing findings were they failed to show. Thus, suspicion started\nto rise that mesosomes were really a microscopic artifact. Ultimately,\nthis is what microbiologists and electron microscopists ended up\nconcluding by the mid-1980s, after more than two decades of research\non these structures.\n\nThere are different interpretations of this episode to be found in the\nliterature. One of the oldest is Rasmussen (1993), who basically\noffered a sociological explanation for the rise and fall of the\nmesosome. This account has been widely criticized (see Rasmussen 2001\nfor a more recent defense). Others have tried to show that this case\nexhibits some methodological standard in action. On Culp\u2019s (1994)\naccount, the case demonstrates the relevance of the standard of\nrobustness in actual scientific practice. According to Culp, the\nmesosome was accepted as a real entity so long as a robust (i.e.,\ndiverse and independently theory-dependent) body of data provided\nsigns of their existence. When the winds changed and the evidence\nagainst the mesosome became more robust than the evidence in its\nfavor, it was dropped by biologists.\n\nAs this presentation should make clear, Culp\u2019s account requires that\nrobustness comes in degrees and that there should, therefore, be some\nway of comparing degrees of robustness. However, no proponents of\nrobustness to date have been able to come up with such a measure.\nUltimately, what the case of the mesosome shows is that, in realistic\ncases, the evidence for some theoretical entity is discordant\n(Stegenga 2009), meaning that some findings supported the existence of\nmesosomes whereas others did not. But this means that robustness as a\ncriterion cannot give unequivocal results, unless there is some way of\nsaying which body of data is more robust: the body that supported the\ntheoretical entity or the body which did not. Thus, when the evidence\nis discordant the criterion of robustness fails to provide a solution\nto the problem of data reliability.\n\nAn alternative account of the mesosome story has been offered by\nHudson (1999). Hudson argues that considerations of robustness did not\nplay a role in the scientists\u2019 decisions concerning the reality\nof the mesosome. Had they, in fact, used such reasoning, they would\nnever have believed in mesosomes. Instead, they used a kind of\nreasoning that Hudson refers to as \u201creliable process\nreasoning\u201d. By this, he means basically that scientists trust\nexperimental data to the extent in which they have reasons to believe\nthat the processes that generated these data provide faithful\nrepresentations of reality. In the case of the mesosome, the evidence\nfrom electron microscopes was first judged reliable. But later, it was\nshown empirically that mesosomes were actually produced by the\npreparation procedure. Briefly, it was shown by various experiments\nthat the chemical fixants used directly damage biological membranes.\nThe mesosomes were thus shown to be artifacts by empirical\nmethods. Considerations of robustness thus played no role in the\nelectron microscopists\u2019 data reliability judgments.\n\nSimilar to Hudson, Weber (2005, Ch. 9) argues that the demonstration\nthat mesosomes were experimental artifacts was nothing but an ordinary\nexperimental demonstration of the existence of a causal relationship,\nnamely between mesosome appearances and the fixation agents. Thus,\nthere may not be any special kind of reasoning other than ordinary\ncausal reasoning (see\n \u00a72.1)\n involved in data reliability judgments.\n\nAn aspect that has so far been largely neglected in this debate is a\ndifferent kind of robustness, namely physical robustness. If\nwe compare the case of the mesosomes with that of other intracellular\norganelles, for example, the eukaryotic nucleus or mitochondria, it is\nnotable that it was never possible to isolate mesosomes, whereas the\nlatter organelles can be recovered in more or less intact form from\ncell extracts, normally by the use of centrifugation. Although it is,\nof course, entirely possible that the structures so recovered are\nartifacts of the preparation procedure, there may be additional\nevidence for their reality. For example, there could be telltale\nenzyme activities that can be measured in isolated cell organelles\nthat correspond to the organelle\u2019s function. It might be possible to\nsubsume this kind of reasoning under Hacking\u2019s (1983) strategies of\nusing the ability to intervene with theoretical entities as a ground\nfor their real existence.\n",
