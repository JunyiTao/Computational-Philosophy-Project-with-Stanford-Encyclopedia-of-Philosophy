    "main_text": "Consistency of the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus\n6. Consistency of the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus\n\nIs the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus consistent? The question might not be\nwell-posed. The \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus is not a logic for reasoning\nabout propositions; there is no apparent notion of contradiction\n\\((\\bot)\\) or a method of forming absurd propositions (e.g., \\(p\n\\wedge \\neg p)\\). Thus \u2018inconsistency\u2019 of the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus cannot mean that \\(\\bot\\), or some formula\ntantamount to \\(\\bot\\), is derivable. A suitable notion of\n\u2018consistent\u2019 is, however, available. Intuitively, a logic\nis inconsistent if it permits us to derive too much. The theory\n\\(\\lambda\\) is a theory of equations. We can thus\ntake inconsistency of \\(\\lambda\\) to mean: all\nequations are derivable. Such a property, if it were true of\n\\(\\lambda\\), would clearly show that\n\\(\\lambda\\) is of little use as a formal theory.\n\nEarly formulations of the idea of \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus by A. Church\nwere indeed inconsistent; see (Barendregt, 1985, appendix 2) or\n(Rosser, 1985) for a discussion. To take a concrete problem: how do we\nknow that the equation \\(\\bK = \\mathbf{I}\\) is not a theorem of\n\\(\\lambda\\)? The two terms are obviously intuitively\ndistinct. \\(\\bK\\) is a function of two arguments, whereas\n\\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is a function of one argument. If we could show that\n\\(\\bK = \\mathbf{I}\\), then we could show that \\(\\mathbf{KK} =\n\\mathbf{IK}\\), whence \\(\\mathbf{KK} = \\bK\\) would be a theorem of\n\\(\\lambda\\), along with many other equations that\nstrike us as intuitively unacceptable. But when we\u2019re\ninvestigating a formal theory such as \\(\\lambda\\),\nintuitive unacceptability by no means implies underivability. What is\nmissing is a deeper understanding of \\(\\beta\\)-reduction.\n\nAn early result that gave such an understanding is known as the\nChurch-Rosser theorem:\n\nTheorem (Church-Rosser) If \\(P \\rhd_{\\beta} Q\\) and\n\\(P \\rhd_{\\beta}\\) R, then there exists a term \\(S\\) such that both\n\\(Q \\rhd_{\\beta} S\\) and \\(R \\rhd_{\\beta} S\\).\n\n(The proof of this theorem is quite non-trivial and is well-beyond the\nscope of this entry.) The result is a deep fact about\n\\(\\beta\\)-reduction. It says that no matter how we diverge from \\(P\\)\nby \\(\\beta\\)-reductions, we can always converge again to a common\nterm.\n\nThe Church-Rosser theorem gives us, among other things, that the plain\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus\u2014that is, the theory\n\\(\\lambda\\) of equations between\n\\(\\lambda\\)-terms\u2014is consistent, in the sense that not all\nequations are derivable.\n\nAs an illustration, we can use the Church-Rosser theorem to solve the\nearlier problem of showing that the two terms \\(\\bK\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{I}\\) are not identified by \\(\\lambda\\). The\ntwo terms are in \\(\\beta\\)-normal form, so from them there are no\n\\(\\beta\\)-reduction sequences at all. If \\(\\bK = \\mathbf{I}\\) were a\ntheorem of \\(\\lambda\\), then there would be a term\n\\(M\\) from which there is a \\(\\beta\\)-reduction path to both\n\\(\\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\bK\\). The Church-Rosser theorem then implies the\ntwo paths diverging from \\(M\\) can be merged. But this is impossible,\nsince \\(\\bK\\) and \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) are distinct \\(\\beta\\)-normal\nforms.\n\nThe Church-Rosser theorem implies the existence of \\(\\beta\\)-reduction\nsequences commencing from \\(\\bK\\) and from \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) that end at\na common term. But there are no \\(\\beta\\)-reduction sequences at all\ncommencing from \\(\\mathbf{I}\\), because it is in \\(\\beta\\)-normal\nform, and likewise for \\(\\bK\\).\n\nTheorem \\(\\lambda\\) is consistent,\nin the sense that not every equation is a theorem.\n\nTo prove the theorem, it is sufficient to produce one underivable\nequation. We have already worked through an example: we used the\nChurch-Rosser theorem to show that the equation \\(\\bK = \\mathbf{I}\\)\nis not a theorem of \\(\\lambda\\). Of course,\nthere\u2019s nothing special about these two terms. A significant\ngeneralization of this result is available: if \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) in\n\\(\\beta\\)-normal form but \\(M\\) is distinct from \\(N\\), then the\nequation \\(M = N\\) is not a theorem of\n\\(\\lambda\\). (This simple condition for\nunderivability does not generally hold if we add additional rules of\ninference to \\(\\lambda\\).) \n\nThe theories \\(\\lambda \\eta\\) and \\(\\lambda\n\\omega\\) are likewise consistent. One can prove these\nconsistency results along the lines of the consistency proof for\n\\(\\lambda\\) by extending the Church-Rosser theorem to\nthe wider senses of derivability of these theories.\n",
