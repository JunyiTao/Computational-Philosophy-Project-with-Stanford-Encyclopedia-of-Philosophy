Historical Survey\n\nWilliam of Sherwood, writing from an Oxford perspective in the 1240s,\nidentified four properties of terms: \u201cThere are four properties\nof terms that we intend to distinguish now \u2026 These properties\nare signification, supposition, copulation, and appellation\u201d\n(tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 105).[1]\n A different tradition is represented by Peter of Spain and Lambert of\nAuxerre, namely, that of Paris. Lambert identifies five properties of\nterms: \u201cthere are many properties of a term, namely,\nsupposition, appellation, restriction, distribution, and relation\n\u2026 But, because signification is, as it were, the perfection of\na term, and because the properties of a term are founded on\nsignification, one ought for the sake of clarity in what follows to\nsee at the outset what the signification of a term is and how it\ndiffers from supposition\u201d (tr. Maloney, p.\n 253).[2]\n In his treatment he includes ampliation (a correlative to\nrestriction) and thereby matches the sections in Peter of\nSpain\u2019s Tractatus: De suppositionibus (On\nSuppositions), De relativis (On Anaphora), De\nampliationibus (On Ampliations), De appellationibus (On\nAppellations), De restrictionibus (On Restrictions), De\ndistributionibus (On Distribution).\n\nTo these must be added further properties of terms which were\nimportant in the theory\u2019s gestation in the twelfth century but\nwere later no longer included as distinct properties: univocation,\nequivocation, adjectivation, substantivation and so on. From the\nfourteenth century onwards, other properties were also abandoned, so\nthat finally the important lasting properties were signification,\nsupposition, ampliation and restriction, and relation (that is, the\nsupposition of relatives, i.e., anaphora).\n\nFrom its beginnings in the twelfth century, the primary distinction\nwas that between signification, sometimes known as univocation, and\nappellation, later known as supposition. As early as Anselm\u2019s\nDe Grammatico we find a distinction between significare\nper se (signify in itself) and significare per aliud\n(signify relatively). The latter was also known as appellare\n(to name or appellate). Whereas in the former (per se) what\nwas signified was a form, in the latter (per aliud) what was\nsignified, or appellated, was a thing. A single form is common to a\nnumber of things we call by the same name, so one crucial problem in\nthe philosophy of language is to understand how the different uses of\na name are unified in the face of the distinctness of the many\nindividuals talked about. In this way, we can understand the\nimportance in the twelfth century of univocation in contrast with\nappellation. Proper names, naming single items, are contrasted with\nappellative names, naming many. Univocation is the signification of a\nunivocal word, described in the Fallacie Parvipontane as\n\u201cretaining the signification of the name while varying its\nsupposition/appellation\u201d (my\n translation).[3]\n Thus a fallacy of univocation occurs when one does not realise that\nwhat were being talked about (the supposita or appellata) change. For\nexample, to infer \u2018A dodo lives\u2019 from \u2018A dodo\nlived\u2019 is a fallacy (of univocation) since the former is false\n(there are no living dodos for \u2018dodo\u2019 to stand for) while\nthe latter is true (for the past tense ampliates \u2018dodo\u2019 to\nstand for past dodos \u2013 see\n section 4).[4]\n\nThroughout much of the twelfth century, \u2018supposition\u2019\nretained the linguistic sense it had had since at least the time of\nPriscian (early 6th century CE), namely, the placing of a name as\n subject.[5]\n The relation of that name as subject to the thing named was called\nits appellation. This was the ability of a univocal appellative noun\nto name different things. The appellation of a name was not fixed,\nhowever. It could be ampliated or restricted by the predicate. So, for\nexample, the predicate \u2018opinabilis\u2019 (credible)\nampliates or extends the appellation of a name such as\n\u2018man\u2019 to cover a wider range, perhaps of no longer\nexisting men, or of men who might have existed, or who might exist in\nthe future. Thus, appellation came to mean the present correct\napplication of a term (William of Sherwood, ed. Lohr et al., p. 265;\ntr. Kretzmann, p. 106), which could be ampliated, or even restricted\nby, say, the apposition of an adjective: \u2018white man\u2019\nappellates only white men, not all even presently existing men.\n\nDe Rijk (1982, pp. 165\u20136) identifies the three stages in the\ndevelopment of the theory of properties of terms: in the first,\nappellation takes centre stage; in the second, appellation theory is\nextended to capture all uses of terms as subject; in the final stage,\nall other properties are grouped under supposition as the overarching\nnotion and \u2018appellation\u2019 underwent its own transformation.\n(See also Kann 2016.) Thus supposition became the leading property of\nan occurrence of a term in a proposition (including now predicates,\nand even parts of predicates), distinguishing what in particular was\nbeing spoken of on some occasion of utterance by some particular use\nof a word (supposition), from that word\u2019s general property of\nmeaning (signification). The term \u2018man\u2019 signifies the form\nof man wherever the term occurs, but each occurrence of the term\n\u2018man\u2019 supposits for the individuals in possibly distinct\nclasses or groups of men (note that it supposits for the men, not the\nclasses).\n\nGiven the literal meaning of \u2018supponere\u2019 as\n\u201cacting as subject\u201d, it is unsurprising that several\nauthors, even as late as Vincent Ferrer in the 1370s, restricted\nsupposition to subject terms, preferring to speak instead of\ncopulation as the corresponding property of the predicate. Those\nreservations aside, however, the natural similarity in function of\nsubject and predicate in picking out varying classes of things while\nremaining a univocal term led most authors to extend the notion of\nsupposition to all terms. Burley (2000, p. 80) says that\n\u201csupposition properly so called is a property of a subject term\nrelative to the predicate\u201d. However, \u201csupposition taken\nbroadly is a property of a term relative to another in a proposition.\nIn this sense, supposition belongs to the subject as well as to the\npredicate, and even to the verb.\u201d At the same time, talk of\nunivocation was superseded by signification, by implication univocal\nsignification unless equivocation was\n identified.[6]\n\nA major shift in focus occurred in the early fourteenth century,\nprobably occasioned by Ockham \u2013 certainly, he was the leading\nfigure among the terminists, those who focussed \u201con terms as the\nbasic unit of logical analysis\u201d (Ashworth 2010, p. 146). For the\nnominalists, signification came to be understood entirely\nextensionally, given their antipathy towards real universals.\nAccordingly, what was taken to be signified by a term were the things\nof which it can be truly predicated instead of a form or property\nwhich they share. For example, whereas hitherto the term\n\u2018man\u2019 had been taken to signify humanity, and\n\u2018white\u2019 whiteness, for Ockham the former signifies (all)\nmen and the latter all white things. From this perspective, the\ncontrast found in thirteenth century authors between (as Peter of\nSpain called it) natural and accidental supposition, becomes less\nimportant. Natural supposition was the term\u2019s natural or nomic\nextension, accidental supposition that range of things it supposited\nfor in a particular proposition. For Peter, the term itself signifies\na form, and supposits naturally for a class of objects, whereas an\noccurrence of the term supposits accidentally on an occasion of use\nfor a group of those objects. For Ockham, the term signifies that\nclass, the form being no more than a fictum (a figment of the\nmind) or (in his later works) the mental act (of conceiving of those\nthings) itself.\n\nFrom the early fourteenth century, signification and supposition came\nto dominate among the properties. Ampliation and restriction were\nalready functions of supposition (or appellation as it had been),\ncopulation as the naming function of predication was also subsumed\nunder supposition, and relatio, the connection of anaphoric\nterms to their antecedents, becamse a matter of the supposition of\nthose terms. Finally, distribution was treated as a particular mode or\ntype of supposition, confused and distributive supposition. Indeed, in\nthe final phase, it could seriously be asked whether supposition was\nindeed a property of terms, as does Albert of Saxony (Quaestiones\ncirca Logicam, q. 12). For like many others, following Peter of\nSpain (2014, p. 240), he defines supposition as \u2018acceptio\ntermini\u2019 (the act of acceptance of a term) of various\nkinds, and so supposition is as much a property of the speaker or\nhearer as of the term.\n2. Signification\n\nSignification contrasts with the other properties of terms in one\nmajor respect, for the other properties (perhaps with the exception of\nappellation in some authors, and natural supposition) are all\nproperties of terms relative to their occurrence in particular\npropositions \u2013 indeed, they are properties of occurrences of\n terms.[7]\n Signification, however, is independent of a term\u2019s particular\nuses or occurrences: \u201cSignification differs from supposition in\nthis that signification is prior to supposition\u201d (Lambert, tr.\nMaloney, p.\n 254).[8]\n Indeed, the other properties are dependent on the signification of\nthe term. For example, an occurrence of a term can only supposit\npersonally (see\n section 3)\n for certain objects in virtue of its signifying them, among others,\nor signifying some property they share.\n\nA twelfth-century commentary on the Perihermeneias reports\nPorphyry as saying that at the time of Aristotle, there was a great\ndebate over the principal signification of utterances: was it\n\u2018res\u2019 (things) or incorporeal natures (Plato) or\nsensus (sensations) or imaginationes\n(representations) or intellectus\n (concepts)?[9]\n In fact, medieval philosophers of language were heir to two\nconflicting semantic theories. According to Aristotle, the greatest\nauthority from the ancient world, words name things by signifying\nconcepts in the mind (Boethius translated Aristotle\u2019s term as\npassiones animae \u2013 affections of the soul) which are\nlikenesses abstracted from them. But Augustine, the greatest of the\nChurch fathers, had held that words signify things by means of those\n concepts.[10]\n This led the medievals to the question: do words signify concepts or\nthings? The question had already been asked by Alexander of\nAphrodisias and his answer was transmitted to the medievals in\nBoethius\u2019 second commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPerihermeneias (De Interpretatione):\n\u201cAlexander asks, if they are the names of things, why has\nAristotle said that spoken sounds are in the first place signs of\nthoughts \u2026 But perhaps, he says, he puts it this way because\nalthough spoken sounds are the names of things we do not use spoken\nsounds to signify things, but [to signify] affections of the soul that\nare produced in us by the things. Then in view of what spoken sounds\nthemselves are used to signify he was right to say they are primarily\nsigns of them\u201d (tr. Smith, pp.\n 36\u201337).[11]\n So words primarily signify concepts.\n\nBut the matter was not settled, other than that whatever view a\nmedieval philosopher took, it had to be made to accord with the\nauthority of Aristotle, perhaps in extremis by reinterpreting\nAristotle\u2019s words. Abelard refers to a distinction between\nsignificatio intellectuum (signification of concepts) and\nsignificatio rei (signification of the thing), more properly\ncalled nomination or appellation (see De Rijk, Logica\nModernorum, vol. II(1), pp. 192\u20135). Similarly, the\nTractatus de proprietatibus sermonum asks whether words\nsignify concepts or things, and responds: both (intellectum et\nrem), but primarily a thing via a concept as medium (op.cit. II\n(2), p. 707).\n\nA particular novelty of the thirteenth century, however, was to\nconceive of the concept itself as a sign. We find this in Lambert of\nAuxerre: \u201cThe signification of a term is the concept of a thing,\nfor which concept of a thing (intellectus rei) a vocal sound\nis imposed at the will of the one instituting it, for, as Aristotle\nproposes in Book One of On Interpretation vocal sounds are\nsigns of affections (passiones) that are in a soul, that is,\nin an intellect, whereas concepts are signs of things\u201d (tr.\nMaloney, p.\n 253).[12]\n Hence by transitivity, utterances which are signs of concepts which\nare signs of things are themselves signs of things: \u201cA vocal\nsign that is a sign of a sign \u2026 [will be directly] a sign of\nthe concept and indirectly a sign of the thing\u201d (tr. Maloney, p.\n 254).[13]\n For example, \u2018man\u2019 immediately signifies the concept man,\nbut by mediation of the concept it signifies the second substance or\nform of man. Accordingly, it can supposit for what fall under man,\ne.g., Plato and Socrates. But it does not signify Plato or\nSocrates.\n\nAs noted above, this last distinction was elided by Ockham, in making\nthe mental act the universal, a name of the things. \u2018Man\u2019,\nhe says, signifies Plato and Socrates and all men equally, by virtue\nof its subordination to the mental act. Once signification is treated\nextensionally in this way, its only difference from supposition lies\nin its priority: a general term signifies all those things of which it\ncan be truly predicated (Ockham, Summa Logicae I c. 33).\n3. Supposition and Copulation\n\nJust as signification corresponds most closely \u2013 though not\nexactly \u2013 to contemporary ideas of meaning or sense, so\nsupposition corresponds in some ways to modern notions of reference,\ndenotation and extension. The comparison is far from exact, however.\nOne major difference is that the medievals distinguished many\ndifferent modes (modi) of supposition. Despite the difference\nbetween different authors\u2019 semantic theories, particularly as\nthey developed over the centuries, there is a remarkable consistency\nin the terminology and interrelation of the different modes.\n\nThe major division is between material, simple and personal\nsupposition. Material supposition is when a term stands for a\nlinguistic item as such. Often, of course, this will be a case of\nautonymy, when it stands for itself. William Sherwood writes:\n\u201cIt is called material when a word itself supposits either [A]\nfor the very utterance itself or [B] for the word itself, composed of\nthe utterance and the signification \u2013 as if we were to say [A]\n\u2018man is a monosyllable\u2019 or [B] \u2018man is a\nname\u2019\u201d (tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 107).[14]\n Writing in Paris nearly a hundred years later, Thomas Maulfelt put it\nlike this: \u201cMaterial supposition is a term standing for itself\nor for another similar to it in sound or writing suppositing in the\nsame way or otherwise which it was not imposed to signify or for some\nother sound which is not inferior to it, and which it does not signify\nnaturally and properly\u201d (my\n translation).[15]\n \u2018Noun\u2019 supposits materially for itself when we say\n\u2018Noun has four letters\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018The term\n\u201cnoun\u201d has four letters\u2019; it doesn\u2019t supposit\nmaterially, but personally for itself, when we say \u2018A noun is a\npart of speech\u2019.\n\nSimple and personal supposition are sometimes grouped together as\n\u201cformal supposition\u201d (in contrast to material). Simple\nsupposition is harder to characterize generally. A common description\nis to say it occurs when a term supposits for the universal or form\nwhich it signifies. However, not everyone believed that terms\nsignified universals. (See the entry on the\n Medieval Problem of Universals.)\n So whereas William of Sherwood wrote \u201cIt is simple when a word\nsupposits what it signifies for what it signifies\u201d (tr.\nKretzmann p.\n 107),[16]\n and Walter Burley likewise: \u201csupposition is simple when a\ncommon term or an aggregated singular term supposits for what it\nsignifies\u201d (tr. Spade p.\n 82),[17]\n William of Ockham appears to characterize simple supposition quite\ndifferently: \u201cSimple supposition occurs when a term supposits\nfor an intention of the soul and is not functioning\nsignificatively\u201d (tr. Loux p.\n 190).[18]\n But in fact, the difference between them is not in their theories of\nsupposition, but rather of signification. As we noted earlier, Ockham\nbelieves that a general term like \u2018man\u2019 signifies\nindividual men like Plato and Socrates; Burley that it signifies a\nsecond substance (the universal), man. Burley appeals to the authority\nof Aristotle: \u201c\u2018man\u2019 is the name of a second\nsubstance; therefore, the term \u2018man\u2019 signifies a second\nsubstance. And it does not signify a second substance that is a genus.\nTherefore, it signifies a species\u201d (De Puritate, tr.\nSpade p.\n 87).[19]\n Ockham, as a nominalist, however, dismissed real universals, and (at\nleast in his later theory represented in Summa Logicae)\nbelieved the only universals were words, including words of the inner\nmental language, mental acts. So for him, a spoken or written term has\nsimple supposition when it stands non-significatively for the mental\nact to which it is subordinated by the conventions of signification,\nthat is, the mental act and its natural signification abstracted from\nthose things which the word conventionally signifies.\n\nJohn Buridan (Summulae, tr. Klima, sec 4.3.2, p. 253)\nfamously eliminated simple supposition altogether, for this very\nreason, namely, that universals are words of a mental language, so\nterms suppositing for them are suppositing for a kind of linguistic\nitem, and so such a case should be included under material\nsupposition.\n\nMaterial and simple supposition are contrasted with personal\nsupposition, what we might call the standard case, where a term stands\nfor ordinary objects \u2013 the objects it signifies (for Ockhamists)\nor what fall under the universal or form that the term signifies, as\nfor example, Lambert (ed. Alessio, p. 209; tr. Maloney, p. 259) or\nBurley express it: \u201cSupposition is personal when a term\nsupposits for its suppositum or supposita or some singular of which\nthe term is accidentally predicated\u201d (tr. Spade p.\n 81).[20]\n The contrast is a useful one, as is shown in the following standard\nfallacies:\n\n\n\nHomo est dignissima creaturarum\n(Man is the worthiest of creatures) \n\nSortes est homo\n(Socrates is a man) \n\nErgo Sortes est dignissima creaturarum\n(So Socrates is the worthiest of creatures).  \n\n\nThe premises are true and the conclusion false, so wherein lies the\nfallacy? It is one of equivocation or \u201cfour terms\u201d:\n\u2018homo\u2019 (\u2018man\u2019) has simple supposition in the\nfirst premise and personal supposition in the second, so there is no\nunambiguous middle term to unite the premises. Again:\n\n\n\nCurrens est participium\n(Running is a participle) \n\nSortes est currens\n(Socrates is running) \n\nErgo Sortes est participium\n(So Socrates is a participle).  \n\n\nThis time, \u2018currens\u2019 (\u2018running\u2019) supposits\ndifferently in the two premises, materially in the first and\npersonally in the second, explaining why putting the two truths\ntogether fallaciously leads to the false conclusion. In earlier times,\nthese would have been called fallacies of univocation since what\nvaries is the supposition, not the signification, of \u2018man\u2019\nand\n \u2018running\u2019.[21]\n\nWhat determines whether a term has material, simple or personal\nsupposition? One view might be that it depends on the intention of the\nspeaker; another, that all propositions are ambiguous and the term can\nbe taken either way. However, the prevailing medieval view was that it\nwas determined by the predicate, so that, e.g., a predicate like\n\u2018is a noun\u2019 enforces material supposition for the subject,\nwhile \u2018is a species\u2019 requires simple supposition: \u201cA\nsubject, on the other hand, sometimes supposits a form separately and\nsometimes does not, depending on what the predicate demands, in\naccordance with the following [principle]: Subjects are of such sorts\nas the predicates may have allowed\u201d (Sherwood, tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 113).[22]\n This slogan, talia subiecta qualia predicata permiserint\n(subjects are such as predicates permit), was commonly attributed to\nBoethius; but Sherwood correctly points out that Boethius\u2019 point\nwas different, and his phrase was the converse: \u201ctalia\n[predicata] qualia subiecta permiserint\u201d \u2013 see De\nRijk, Logica Modernorum II (1), p. 561.\n\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it became commonplace to\nrequire a nota materialitatis (a sign of the material use)\nfor a term in material supposition. Such a sign was to prefix\n\u2018iste terminus\u2019 (\u2018this term\u2019) or\n\u2018ly\u2019 (taken from the French definite article) to the term.\nWithout such an indication, the term was considered to have personal\nsupposition by\n default.[23]\n The use of inverted commas is a much later innovation, though some\nscribes indicate material supposition (or quotation) by surrounding\nthe term or phrase with a pair of dots (puncta).\n\nPersonal supposition is divided by most authors into discrete and\ncommon supposition, the first that of singular terms (proper names,\ndemonstrative phrases and so on), the latter that of general terms.\nCommon personal supposition is again divided, namely, into determinate\nand confused, and the latter into confused and distributive and merely\nconfused supposition. These three modes are well illustrated by the\nfour categorical forms (see the entry on the\n  Traditional Square of Opposition):\n\n\n(A) All A are B.\n\n(E) No A are B.\n\n(I) Some A are B.\n\n(O) Some A are not B.\n\n\nThe subject of (I)- and (O)-, and the predicate of (I)-propositions,\nhave determinate supposition; the subject and predicate of (E)-, the\nsubject of (A)-, and the predicate of (O)-propositions have confused\nand distributive supposition; and the predicate of (A)-propositions\nhas merely confused supposition. This is common doctrine; what varies\nis how these modes are characterised. \u201cIt is determinate\u201d,\nwrites William of Sherwood, \u201cwhen the locution can be expounded\nby means of some single thing\u201d (tr. Kretzmann, p. 108), but he\naddresses a doubt: \u201cIt seems that when I say \u2018a man is\nrunning\u2019 [i.e. an I-proposition] the term \u2018man\u2019 does\nnot supposit determinately, since [A] the proposition is indefinite,\nand [B] it is uncertain for whom the term \u2018man\u2019 supposits.\nTherefore it supposits [A] indefinitely and [B] uncertainly; therefore\nindeterminately\u201d (pp.\n 115\u20136).[24]\n But this is simply a matter of terminology, he replies \u2013\ndeterminate supposition means suppositing for one, not for many, but\nfor no particular one, for that would constitute discrete supposition.\nNote, however, that for Ockham, Burley and others, a term with\ndeterminate supposition supposits for everything of which it can be\ntruly predicated. The sense in which it is true of one, rather than\nmany, is that the proposition is true if true of one. The term still\nsupposits for all. As Burley says: \u201cThe supposition is called\n\u2018determinate\u2019, not because a term suppositing\ndeterminately in this way supposits for one suppositum and not for\nanother. Rather the supposition is called \u2018determinate\u2019\nbecause for the truth of a proposition in which the common term\nsupposits determinately it is required that the proposition be made\ntrue for some determinate suppositum\u201d (tr. Spade pp.\n 102\u20133).[25]\n\nAll that William of Sherwood can offer to characterize confused\nsupposition is to say that it is had when a term supposits for many,\nthen resorting to examples for its divisions. Peter of Spain tries\nharder: \u201cConfused supposition is taking a common term in place\nof many by means of a universal sign\u201d (tr. Copenhaver, p.\n 249),[26]\n and confused and distributive when it supposits for all. But this is\nstill unclear, and eventually a solution was found in the doctrine of\nascent and descent. Call the individual things falling under a general\nterm its \u201cinferiors\u201d, and call the singular proposition\nresulting from a general proposition by replacing a general term (with\nits qualifier) by a term with discrete supposition for one of its\ninferiors, one of the proposition\u2019s \u201csingulars\u201d.\nThen the inference from a general proposition to one of its singulars\nis called \u201cdescent\u201d, the converse inference,\n\u201cascent\u201d. If descent under a term is valid, or at least is\nvalid without changing the rest of the proposition, it is called\n\u201cmobile\u201d, otherwise \u201cimmobile\u201d. Walter Burley,\nWilliam of Ockham and their followers could then define the three\nmodes of common personal supposition as follows:\n\nAn occurrence of a general term in a proposition has determinate\nsupposition when one can descend validly from the proposition to the\ncomplete disjunction of its singulars with respect to that term, and\nconversely can ascend validly from any singular;\nOtherwise, it is confused, and (i) is confused and distributive if\none can validly descend from the proposition to the indefinite\nconjunction of its singulars with respect to that term; otherwise (ii)\nit is merely confused.\n\n\nIn this last case, 2 (ii), Ockham noted: \u201cit is possible to\ndescend by way of a proposition with a disjunctive predicate and it is\npossible to infer the original proposition from any [singular]\u201d\n(tr. Loux p.\n 201).[27]\n Thus the predicate of an A-proposition has merely confused\nsupposition since descents 1 and 2 (i) are invalid, but from\n\u2018Every man is an animal\u2019 one can validly infer\n\u2018Every man is this animal or that animal and so on for all\nanimals\u2019, and conversely, from \u2018Every man is this\nanimal\u2019 (were it ever true) one could infer that every man is an\nanimal.\n\nA final complication came at the end of the fourteenth century and\nsubsequently, when it was asked: \u201cAre there only three modes of\ncommon personal supposition?\u201d Some answered, \u2018Yes\u2019;\nbut others distinguished two modes of merely confused supposition, or\nequivalently distinguished a fourth case, 2 (iii), collective\nsupposition, where descent was permissible to a proposition with a\nconjunctive term. The standard example was \u2018All the apostles of\nGod are 12\u2019, which entails \u2018Matthew and Mark and so on are\n12\u2019, with a conjunctive\n subject.[28]\n\nSeveral recent commentators have asked what the medieval theory of\nmodes of common personal supposition was for: was it a theory of\ninference, of quantification, of truth-conditions, of fallacies, or\nwhat? Asking these questions may help us to come to terms with the\ntheory; but if pressed too hard, they are unhelpful. The\nmedievals\u2019 theory was none of these things; it was their\ntheoretical basis with which to pose and answer certain semantic\nquestions.\n\nAll modes of supposition so far described fall under what was\nvariously called proper supposition or accidental supposition or,\nexcluding material supposition, formal supposition. Distinct from\nthese were what Peter of Spain called natural supposition, mentioned\nearlier in the discussion of signification, and what Ockham and others\ncall improper supposition, covering metaphor and other figures of\nspeech.\n\nMoreover, various authors before the fourteenth century, and at least\none fourteenth century author too (namely, Vincent Ferrer) differed a\nlittle from what has been said in not attributing supposition to\npredicate terms, calling the corresponding property of predicates,\n\u201ccopulation\u201d. However, even in the early thirteenth\ncentury, this distinction was fading. William of Sherwood makes it\nclearly: substantive names and pronouns supposit, whereas adjectives,\nparticiples and verbs copulate \u2013 all those terms which are\nattributed to something by means of the copula \u2018is\u2019. Only\nthe modes of common personal supposition are repeated for copulation:\n\u201cevery copulating word signifies in adjunction to a substantive\nand thus is copulated personally \u2026 [and] every copulating word\nis the name of an accident, but every name of an accident is common;\ntherefore no copulation is discrete\u201d (Sherwood, tr. Kretzmann,\np.\n 121).[29]\n However, even in Lambert and Peter of Spain, there is only an empty\nnod towards copulation. Lambert notes that properly speaking,\nsupposition attaches to substantives, while copulation is appropriate\nfor adjectival terms. But broadly speaking, he says, supposition\nbelongs to both (ed. Alessio, p. 208; tr. Maloney, p. 258). The\ndistinction is clearly unnecessary and useless, and although the term\nis preserved in, e.g., Walter Burley\u2019s De Puritate, his\ndiscussion headed \u2018On Copulation\u2019 is in fact a discussion\nof the uses of the copula, \u2018est\u2019.\n4. Ampliation and Restriction\n\nSome words have the effect of widening or narrowing the supposition of\nother terms in a proposition. For example, by qualifying\n\u2018man\u2019 with the adjective \u2018white\u2019, we restrict\nthe supposition of \u2018man\u2019 in \u2018A white man is\nrunning\u2019 to white men; while a verb in the past tense ampliates\nthe supposition of the subject to include what were its supposita. For\nexample, \u2018A white thing was black\u2019 means that something\nwhich is now white or was white in the past was black.\n\nLambert of Auxerre is typical in describing the many aspects of a\nproposition which can produce ampliation or restriction. Some are\nnatural, as when \u2018rational\u2019 restricts \u2018animal\u2019\nto supposit only for men by being adjoined to it; other cases are\n\u2018usualis\u2019 \u2013 \u2018use-governed\u2019 in\nMaloney\u2019s translation (p. 278): for example, when we say\n\u2018The king [or better \u2018A king\u2019 (rex)] is\ncoming\u2019, we are taken to mean the king of the country where we\nare, so \u2018king\u2019 is restricted to supposit only for that\nking. Some ampliation and restriction is effected by consignification,\nthat is, by an aspect of a word \u2013 by the tense of the verb, or\nby the gender of an adjective: in \u2018homo alba\u2019, the\nfeminine ending of \u2018alba\u2019 restricts \u2018homo\u2019 to\nsupposit only for women, indeed, white women. Other ampliation and\nrestriction is effected by the signification of words \u2013 as in\nthe case of \u2018rational animal\u2019 just mentioned, or in\n\u201cSocrates\u2019 donkey\u201d, where the possessive restricts\n\u2018donkey\u2019 to supposit only for Socrates\u2019 donkeys.\n\nPeter of Spain (ed. Copenhaver, p. 441) notes that only general terms\ncan be ampliated or restricted, and only terms having personal\nsupposition.\n\nJust as the past tense ampliates the subject to include past as well\nas present supposita, modal verbs ampliate the subject to possible\nsupposita, as do verbs such as \u2018understand\u2019,\n\u2018believe\u2019, and indeed, notes Albert of Saxony, verbal\nnouns ending in \u2018-bile\u2019: \u2018possible\u2019,\n\u2018audible\u2019, \u2018credible\u2019, \u2018capable of\nlaughter\u2019 and so on. Albert (Perutilis Logica II 11,\ned. Berger, p. 380) realises that even \u2018supposit\u2019\nampliates the subject: when we say \u2018This term supposits for\nsomething\u2019, what it supposits for need not actually exist, but\nmight be past, future, possible or merely intelligible. According to\nBuridan, \u2018must\u2019 ampliates for possible supposita, for\n\u2018A must be B\u2019 means \u2018It is not\npossible that A not be B\u2019, contradictories\nmust clearly ampliate in the same way, and \u2018It is possible that\nA not be B\u2019 ampliates for possibilia.\nAmpliation over possibles means care is needed in inferences from\n\u2018is\u2019 to \u2018can\u2019: \u2018A can be\nB\u2019 need not follow from \u2018A is\nB\u2019, for \u2018A can be B\u2019\nmeans that what is or can be A can be B, and even if\nA is B, not everything which can be A might\nbe capable of being B. For example, \u2018Every planet\nlighting our hemisphere can be the sun\u2019 is false even though it\nis in fact the sun which lights it, since the moon might light our\nhemisphere but the moon cannot be the\n sun.[30]\n\nIt is an interesting fact that almost alone among terminist logicians,\nOckham does not speak of ampliation and restriction. (See Priest and\nRead 1981.) The reason appears to be that he disagrees with the\ntruth-condition given above for \u2018A white thing was black\u2019,\nand similar cases. This proposition, he says, is ambiguous. Rather\nthan meaning that what is or was white was black, it equivocates\nbetween \u2018What is white was black\u2019 and \u2018What was\nblack was white\u2019: \u201cin the case of every proposition of the\npast and of the future in which the subject is a general term or a\ndemonstrative pronoun with a general term or a discrete term referring\nto some composite, we must distinguish [two\n senses]\u201d.[31]\n Whether Ockham realized that his theory improved on the ampliative\ntheory is unclear; nonetheless, his account seems to accord better\nwith intuition. For the ampliative account is disjunctive: it says\nthat the proposition is true if either what was white was black or\nwhat is white was black. Then it is true if either disjunct is true;\nwhereas on Ockham\u2019s account it has two different senses, and can\nbe false on one while true on the other \u2013 true because something\nnow white used to be black but false if nothing which used to be white\nwas ever black. For a clearer case, take the first sex-change\noperation \u2013 for the first time, say, a woman was a man. But no\none who was a woman had ever been a man, so it was (also) false that a\nwoman was a man. The proposition \u2018A woman was a man\u2019 is\nambiguous and \u201cest distinguenda \u201d (i.e.,\ndifferent senses must be distinguished, one true, one false).\n\nOckham also eschews talk of ampliation in giving his account of modal\npropositions. Does \u2018A white thing can be black\u2019 mean that\nwhat is or can be white can be black, i.e., that either what is white\ncan be black or what can be white can be black, as the ampliative\naccount demands? \u2013 cf., e.g., Albert of Saxony: \u201cFor\n\u2018A white thing can be black\u2019 signifies that what is white\nor what can be white can be black\u201d (my\n translation).[32]\n No, for this loses the sense in which it is self-contradictory to\nsuggest that it is possible that a white thing be black. The\nproposition is ambiguous, in one sense self-contradictory, in the\nother true, Ockham notes (Summa Logicae II 10), because\n\u2018This is black\u2019 can be true if uttered pointing to\nsomething white: \u201c\u2018A white thing can be black\u2019 is\ntrue, because \u2018This is black\u2019 is possible, pointing to\nsomething for which \u2018white\u2019 supposits; but \u2018A white\nthing is black\u2019 is\n impossible\u201d.[33]\n5. Appellation\n\nPerhaps the term with the most varied history is\n\u2018appellatio\u2019, though even so, one can discern a common\nthread running through it. It starts, we saw, as an equivalent of\n\u2018nominatio\u2019 in Anselm and Abelard, and by the thirteenth\ncentury is used to pick out the present extension of a term, that of\nwhich it can be truly predicated in the present tense: \u201cSo now\none should know that appellation is spoken of in four ways \u2026 In\nthe fourth way, appellation is said to be the acceptance of a term for\na suppositum or supposita existing actually, and our present focus is\non appellation spoken of in this fourth way\u201d (Lambert, tr.\nMaloney pp.\n 261\u20132).[34]\n In Burley, at the turn of the fourteenth century, it almost usurps\nthe place of \u2018copulatio\u2019, being for him the relation of\nthe predicate to its inferiors: \u201cThus, just as supposition taken\nstrictly is a property of the subject insofar as it is matched with\nthe predicate, so appellation is a property of the predicate matched\nwith the subject or with an inferior\u201d (De Puritate, tr.\nSpade p.\n 131).[35]\n There are shades too, of Abelard: \u201ca univocal general term\nappellates its inferiors but does not signify\n them\u201d.[36]\n But the crucial phrase which runs through the history of the term\nappears here too: \u201cthe predicate appellates its form\u201d\n(ed. Boehner, p. 48: \u201cpraedicatum appellat suam\nformam\u201d). What Burley says he means by this is that the\npredicate should be truly predicable at some time, in the present\ntense, of the supposita of the subject.\n\nIt is ampliation and restriction which distinguish this property of\nthe predicate from properties of the subject. For, on the standard\naccount, the subject may be ampliated, or restricted, by the predicate\n(or by the copula or other signs), but the predicate itself is never\nampliated or restricted: as we saw above, \u2018A white thing was\nblack\u2019 is true only if \u2018black\u2019 has at some time been\ntruly predicable of the supposita of the subject, namely, of what is\nor was white. In contrast, \u2018A white thing is black\u2019 may\nnever have been true \u2013 indeed, in this case, it never will have\nsince it is self-contradictory. So the subject does not always\n\u201cappellate its form\u201d, that is, one must use a\ndemonstrative to give the truth-conditions of such propositions (see\nPanaccio 2012, \u00a72 esp. p. 144\u20135). A consequence pointed out by\nJohn Buridan, among\n others,[37]\n is that conversion needs application with care in such cases.\nConsider \u2018The just will be justly damned\u2019: this can be\ntrue, if those who are just sin in the future. But \u2018Justly will\nthe just be damned\u2019 is false, for \u2018Justly are the just\ndamned\u2019 will never be true. Similarly, \u2018Socrates\napproaching you know\u2019 can be true while \u2018You know Socrates\napproaching\u2019 (the \u201chooded man\u201d fallacy from\nAristotle\u2019s De Sophisticis Elenchis 179b1\u20133) may\nbe false (for you know Socrates, but do not recognize him\napproaching). It is explained by reason of the fact that the predicate\nappellates its form (for \u2018You know Socrates approaching\u2019\nrequires that the predicate \u2018know Socrates approaching\u2019 be\ntrue of you and so is false), whereas \u2018Socrates approaching you\nknow\u2019 requires only that \u2018Him you know\u2019 be true,\nreferring to Socrates, and it is true. The doctrine of appellation\ncould thus be used to diagnose familiar fallacies.\n\nScott, in his discussion of Buridan\u2019s treatment of the sophism,\n\u2018You know the one approaching\u2019 (pp. 42\u20139), claims\nthat Buridan\u2019s concept of appellation (which he misleadingly\ntranslates as \u2018connotation\u2019) in his diagnosis is novel,\nand Spade follows him in his commentary on Peter of Ailly (p.109\nn.188). But the notion is clearly continuous with Burley\u2019s in\nthat \u2018appellating its form\u2019 requires true predication via\na demonstration. Indeed, it is continuous with Lambert\u2019s usage,\nfor \u2018chimera\u2019 has no appellata precisely because\n\u2018hoc est chimera\u2019 (\u2018This is a chimera\u2019) is\nfalse whatever is demonstrated. Admittedly, Buridan explicitly\nrestricts appellation to appellative terms, that is, \u201cevery term\nconnoting something other than what it supposits for\u201d\n(Summulae de Dialectica: Treatise on Suppositions, tr. Klima,\np. 291), and it \u201cappellates that which it connotes as pertaining\nto that which it supposits for\u201d. Thus \u2018white\u2019\nconnotes whiteness and supposits for white things. What appears to be\nnovel in Buridan is the extension of the doctrine to intentional\nverbs, which, Buridan says, cause the terms following them (the\npredicate, or part of the predicate) to appellate their\nrationes, that is, the concepts by which they signify what\nthey do. Thus in \u2018You know Socrates approaching\u2019, the\nexpression \u2018Socrates approaching\u2019 appellates its concept,\nthe ratio \u2018Socrates approaching\u2019, and so the\nproposition is false unless you are aware who it is; whereas in\n\u2018Socrates approaching you know\u2019, the subject\n\u2018Socrates approaching\u2019 appellates its concept only under\ndisjunction to the rationes of other possible substituents in\nthe same grammatical position, and so it suffices that \u2018Him you\nknow\u2019 be true, where \u2018him\u2019 refers to Socrates under\nsome concept or\n other.[38]\n6. Relation\n\nLambert of Auxerre (tr. Maloney, p. 290) speaks explicitly of relation\nas a property of terms, but most authors describe the phenomenon as\nthe supposition of relatives. The relation in question is that between\nanaphoric terms and their antecedents. Most treatises consist of a\nrepetition of a standard taxonomy: there are relatives of substance\nand relatives of accident, relatives of identity and relatives of\ndiversity. For example, relatives of substance and of identity are\n\u2018who\u2019, \u2018he\u2019, \u2018his\u2019, and among\nthese, reciprocal relatives such as \u2018himself\u2019; of\ndiversity are \u2018another\u2019 and \u2018someone else\u2019.\nThe latter are said to refer back (referre, past participle\nrelatum) to their antecedent but to supposit for something\ndifferent, as in, e.g., \u2018Socrates is running and someone else is\ndebating\u2019. Relatives of accident include, first, those of\nidentity, \u2018such as\u2019, \u2018like\u2019,\n\u2018when\u2019, and those of diversity, \u2018in another\nway\u2019, \u2018other\u2019; in, say, \u2018Socrates is running\nand Plato is other\u2019, \u2018other\u2019 refers back to\n\u2018running\u2019; in what way it differs will depend on the\nauthor\u2019s account of predicates.\n\nIn contrast to the extensive taxonomy, medieval discussions of\nrelatives before the mid-fourteenth century seem rather short on\ntheory, dealing with puzzles more by common sense and description than\nin any unified way. For example, the prevailing view is that relatives\nof identity preserve the supposition of their antecedent. Why, then,\ncan they usually not replace the antecedent? Consider, e.g.,\n\u2018Every man sees himself\u2019. Does \u2018himself\u2019 have\nthe same supposition as \u2018man\u2019 (or \u2018every man\u2019)\nand if so, why can the antecedent not replace it? \u2013 for\n\u2018Every man sees every man\u2019 has a very different\nsignification. Lambert (tr. Maloney, p. 299) claims that in the case\nof reciprocal relatives the reciprocal pronoun can replace the\nantecedent unless the antecedent is taken universally, as in\n\u2018Every man sees himself\u2019. In this case, it still supposits\nfor the same as its antecedent, but in a different way, namely,\ndiscretely. Ockham spells it out: \u201cin \u2018Every man sees\nhimself\u2019, \u2018himself\u2019 supposits for every man by means\nof confused and distributive mobile supposition: but it does this\nsingularly since it is not possible to descend without altering the\nother extreme \u2026 thus, \u2018Every man sees himself, therefore,\nSocrates sees Socrates\u2019\u201d (tr. Loux p.\n 218).[39]\n\nOckham claims that, although non-reciprocal relatives of identity\nalways supposit for that for which their antecedent supposits, those\nwhose antecedent is a general term occurring with personal supposition\ncan never be replaced by their antecedent and result in an equivalent\nproposition. For example, \u2018A man runs and he disputes\u2019 is\nnot convertible with \u2018A man runs and a man disputes\u2019.\nBuridan has two rules to explain what is happening (Summulae,\ntr. Klima pp. 283\u20134):\n\nA relative of identity \u201crefers back to its antecedent only\nwith respect to those of the antecedent\u2019s supposita for which\nthe categorical proposition in which its antecedent occurred was\nverified\u201d\nA relative of identity \u201csupposits or is taken in a\nproposition as is its antecedent, namely, materially if materially,\npersonally if personally, distributively if distributively,\ndeterminately if determinately, merely confusedly if merely\nconfusedly\u201d, except as in 1.\n\n\nHence, in e.g., \u2018Man is a species and it is predicable of\nmany\u2019, or \u2018Socrates runs and he disputes\u2019, the\nrelative can be replaced without loss of meaning by its antecedent.\nBut in \u2018A man runs and he disputes\u2019, it cannot, for the\nsupposition would change. \u2018He\u2019 supposits only for men who\nare running, whereas \u2018a man\u2019, if it replaced it, would\nsupposit for all men.\n\nAnother issue concerned identifying the contradictory of a proposition\ncontaining a relative. A categorical containing a relative of identity\nsuch as \u2018A, which is B, is C\u2019\nis equivalent to \u2018A is B and A is\nC\u2019. Hence its contradictory, \u2018A, which\nis B, is not C\u2019, says Albert of Saxony, is\nequivalent to \u2018A is not B or A is not\nC\u2019: \u201cThe second rule: a negative categorical\nproposition in which a relative term occurs is equivalent to a\ndisjunctive proposition: e.g., \u2018Socrates, who is running, is not\ndisputing\u2019 has the same truth-value as \u2018Socrates is not\nrunning or Socrates is not disputing\u2019. And therefore such a\nproposition has two causes of truth, each of which is sufficient on\nits own for its truth. Hence \u2018Socrates, who is running, is not\ndisputing\u2019 is true either because Socrates is not running or\nbecause Socrates is not disputing. Hence because by the first rule the\naffirmative is equivalent to a conjunction, it follows that the\nnegative contradictory to it is equivalent to a disjunction composed\nfrom the contradictories of the conjuncts, since conjunctions and\ndisjunctions with contradictory parts contradict one\n another\u201d.[40]\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe medievals did not have a solution to every semantic puzzle with\nwhich they were faced, any more than do contemporary philosophers. But\ntheir theory of properties of terms was the basis of a rich semantic\ntheory within which they were able to develop complete and fruitful\ntheories which yielded significant insights \u2013 both for them and\nfor us \u2013 into a broad range of semantic issues.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Albert of Saxony, <em>Perutilis Logica</em>, Venice 1522; ed.\nHarald Berger (with German translation) in Albert von Sachsen,\n<em>Logik</em>.
