    "main_text": "Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy || Morality\n2.3 Morality\n\nEmerson\u2019s views about morality are intertwined with his\nmetaphysics of process, and with his perfectionism, his idea that life\nhas the goal of passing into \u201chigher forms\u201d (CW3:14). The\ngoal remains, but the forms of human life, including the virtues, are\nall \u201cinitial\u201d (CW2: 187). The word \u201cinitial\u201d\nsuggests the verb \u201cinitiate,\u201d and one interpretation of\nEmerson\u2019s claim that \u201call virtues are initial\u201d is\nthat virtues initiate historically developing forms of life, such as\nthose of the Roman nobility or the Confucian junxi. Emerson\ndoes have a sense of morality as developing historically, but in the\ncontext in \u201cCircles\u201d where his statement appears he\npresses a more radical and skeptical position: that our virtues often\nmust be abandoned rather than developed. \u201cThe terror of\nreform,\u201d he writes, \u201cis the discovery that we must cast\naway our virtues, or what we have always esteemed such, into the same\npit that has consumed our grosser vices\u201d (CW2: 187). The\nqualifying phrase \u201cor what we have always esteemed such\u201d\nmeans that Emerson does not embrace an easy relativism, according to\nwhich what is taken to be a virtue at any time must actually be a\nvirtue. Yet he does cast a pall of suspicion over all established\nmodes of thinking and acting. The proper standpoint from which to\nsurvey the virtues is the \u2018new moment\u2018 \u2014 what he\nelsewhere calls truth rather than repose (CW2:202) \u2014 in which\nwhat once seemed important may appear \u201ctrivial\u201d or\n\u201cvain\u201d (CW2:189). From this perspective (or more properly\nthe developing set of such perspectives) the virtues do not disappear,\nbut they may be fundamentally altered and rearranged.\n\nAlthough Emerson is thus in no position to set forth a system of\nmorality, he nevertheless delineates throughout his work a set of\nvirtues and heroes, and a corresponding set of vices and villains. In\n\u201cCircles\u201d the vices are \u201cforms of old age,\u201d\nand the hero the \u201creceptive, aspiring\u201d youth (CW2:189). In\nthe \u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d the villain is the\n\u201cspectral\u201d preacher whose sermons offer no hint that he\nhas ever lived. \u201cSelf Reliance\u201d condemns virtues that are\nreally \u201cpenances\u201d (CW2: 31), and the philanthropy of\nabolitionists who display an idealized \u201clove\u201d for those\nfar away, but are full of hatred for those close by (CW2: 30).\n\nConformity is the chief Emersonian vice, the opposite or\n\u201caversion\u201d of the virtue of \u201cself-reliance.\u201d\nWe conform when we pay unearned respect to clothing and other symbols\nof status, when we show \u201cthe foolish face of praise\u201d or\nthe \u201cforced smile which we put on in company where we do not\nfeel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest\nus\u201d (CW2: 32). Emerson criticizes our conformity even to our own\npast actions-when they no longer fit the needs or aspirations of the\npresent. This is the context in which he states that \u201ca foolish\nconsistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\nstatesmen, philosophers and divines\u201d (CW2: 33). There is wise\nand there is foolish consistency, and it is foolish to be consistent\nif that interferes with the \u201cmain enterprise of the world for\nsplendor, for extent,\u2026the upbuilding of a man\u201d (CW1:\n65).\n\nIf Emerson criticizes much of human life, he nevertheless devotes most\nof his attention to the virtues. Chief among these is what he calls\n\u201cself-reliance.\u201d The phrase connotes originality and\nspontaneity, and is memorably represented in the image of a group of\nnonchalant boys, \u201csure of a dinner\u2026who would disdain as\nmuch as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one\u2026\u201d The\nboys sit in judgment on the world and the people in it, offering a\nfree, \u201cirresponsible\u201d condemnation of those they see as\n\u201csilly\u201d or \u201ctroublesome,\u201d and praise for those\nthey find \u201cinteresting\u201d or \u201celoquent.\u201d (CW2:\n29). The figure of the boys illustrates Emerson\u2019s characteristic\ncombination of the romantic (in the glorification of children) and the\nclassical (in the idea of a hierarchy in which the boys occupy the\nplace of lords or nobles).\n\nAlthough he develops a series of analyses and images of self-reliance,\nEmerson nevertheless destabilizes his own use of the concept.\n\u201cTo talk of reliance,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a poor\nexternal way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies, because\nit works and is\u201d (CW 2:40). \u2018Self-reliance\u2019 can be\ntaken to mean that there is a self already formed on which we may\nrely. The \u201cself\u201d on which we are to \u201crely\u201d is,\nin contrast, the original self that we are in the process of creating.\nSuch a self, to use a phrase from Nietzsche\u2019s Ecce Homo,\n\u201cbecomes what it is.\u201d\n\nFor Emerson, the best human relationships require the confident and\nindependent nature of the self-reliant. Emerson\u2019s ideal society\nis a confrontation of powerful, independent \u201cgods, talking from\npeak to peak all round Olympus.\u201d There will be a proper distance\nbetween these gods, who, Emerson advises, \u201cshould meet each\nmorning, as from foreign countries, and spending the day together\nshould depart, as into foreign countries\u201d (CW 3:81). Even\n\u201clovers,\u201d he advises, \u201cshould guard their\nstrangeness\u201d (CW3: 82). Emerson portrays himself as preserving\nsuch distance in the cool confession with which he closes\n\u201cNominalist and Realist,\u201d the last of the Essays,\nSecond Series:\n\nI talked yesterday with a pair of philosophers: I endeavored to show\nmy good men that I liked everything by turns and nothing long\u2026.\nCould they but once understand, that I loved to know that they\nexisted, and heartily wished them Godspeed, yet, out of my poverty of\nlife and thought, had no word or welcome for them when they came to\nsee me, and could well consent to their living in Oregon, for any\nclaim I felt on them, it would be a great satisfaction (CW 3:145).\n\n\nThe self-reliant person will \u201cpublish\u201d her results, but\nshe must first learn to detect that spark of originality or genius\nthat is her particular gift to the world. It is not a gift that is\navailable on demand, however, and a major task of life is to meld\ngenius with its expression. \u201cThe man,\u201d Emerson states\n\u201cis only half himself, the other half is his expression\u201d\n(CW 3:4). There are young people of genius, Emerson laments in\n\u201cExperience,\u201d who promise \u201ca new world\u201d but\nnever deliver: they fail to find the focus for their genius\n\u201cwithin the actual horizon of human life\u201d (CW 3:31).\nAlthough Emerson emphasizes our independence and even distance from\none another, then, the payoff for self-reliance is public and social.\nThe scholar finds that the most private and secret of his thoughts\nturn out to be \u201cthe most acceptable, most public, and\nuniversally true\u201d (CW1: 63). And the great \u201crepresentative\nmen\u201d Emerson identifies are marked by their influence on the\nworld. Their names-Plato, Moses, Jesus, Luther, Copernicus, even\nNapoleon-are \u201cploughed into the history of this world\u201d\n(CW1: 80).\n\nAlthough self-reliance is central, it is not the only Emersonian\nvirtue. Emerson also praises a kind of trust, and the practice of a\n\u201cwise skepticism.\u201d There are times, he holds, when we must\nlet go and trust to the nature of the universe: \u201cAs the traveler\nwho has lost his way, throws his reins on his horse\u2019s neck, and\ntrusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do\nwith the divine animal who carries us through this world\u201d\n(CW3:16). But the world of flux and conflicting evidence also requires\na kind of epistemological and practical flexibility that Emerson calls\n\u201cwise skepticism\u201d (CW4: 89). His representative skeptic of\nthis sort is Michel de Montaigne, who as portrayed in\nRepresentative Men is no unbeliever, but a man with a strong\nsense of self, rooted in the earth and common life, whose quest is for\nknowledge. He wants \u201ca near view of the best game and the chief\nplayers; what is best in the planet; art and nature, places and\nevents; but mainly men\u201d (CW4: 91). Yet he knows that life is\nperilous and uncertain, \u201ca storm of many elements,\u201d the\nnavigation through which requires a flexible ship, \u201cfit to the\nform of man.\u201d (CW4: 91).\n",
