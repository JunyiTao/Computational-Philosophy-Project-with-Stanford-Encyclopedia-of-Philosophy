    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nGiven that he led such an active public life while also raising a\nlarge family, the sheer quantity of Grotius\u2019 works is nothing\nshort of astonishing. Typical, for him, was the time of his embassy to\nFrance early in his life. The same year as the embassy, he published\nPontifex Romanus, a collection of six essays on recent\npolitical events. While working on this, he produced what are in\nessence critical editions of two works: the Phaenomena, an\nastronomical work of the third century BCE by Aratus of Soli, and\nMartianus Capella\u2019s handbook of the seven liberal arts. He also\nbegan research on a history of the Netherlands, research would which\nmuch later would result in the Annales et Historiae de Rebus\nBelgicis. And he did all this while still in his late teens. Over\nthe full course of his life, Grotius would write or edit some\nfive-dozen book-length works and innumerable smaller pieces.\n\nTo philosophers and the philosophically-minded, two of these stand\nout: De iure praedae commentarius (Commentary on the law\nof prize and booty, henceforth referred to as\n\u201cDIP\u201d) and De iure belli ac pacis\n(\u201cDIB\u201d). The former was almost lost. Placed in a\ntrunk sometime during or after his life, the sole manuscript copy was\nuncovered when some of his descendants sold a collection of his papers\nin 1864 (for an account of these events, see Knight 1925: Chap. 5 and\nvan Ittersum 2006). It was apparently commissioned by the V.O.C.\naround 1603. In it, Grotius was to defend the capture of a large\nPortuguese merchant ship by a V.O.C. fleet in the area around\nmodern-day Singapore. The key legal and conceptual question was\nwhether any private agent (such as the V.O.C.) could legitimately\nemploy force against another private agent which was impeding its\nactions (see Tuck 1993: 170). But it also had an important\npropagandistic objective, which was to defame the Portuguese (and\nSpanish) while extolling the V.O.C. and Dutch (for more on the general\nhistorical context of the DIP, see van Ittersum 2002). Modern\nphilosophical readers will find the \u201cProlegomena\u201d of\nChapter Two especially interesting, since that is where Grotius lays\nout his views on the nature and bases of rights. While Grotius chose\nnot to publish this or most of the manuscript, he did see Chapter\nTwelve into press. Given the title Mare Liberum (On the\nfreedom of the seas), it was both influential and controversial:\namong others, the Englishman John Selden published a critical\nreply.\n\nWhatever the merits of the DIP, it is on the DIB\nthat the bulk of Grotius\u2019 reputation rests. It consists of an\nintroduction and three books, totaling more than 900 pages in\ntranslation. As with DIP, the introduction or\n\u201cProlegomena\u201d holds the greatest interest for\nphilosophers, for it is here that Grotius articulates and defends the\nphilosophical foundations of the DIB. While philosophers are\nnaturally attracted to the \u201cProlegomena\u201d, the body of the\nDIB is also redolent with themes of philosophical interest.\nBook One defines the concept of war, argues for the legitimacy of war,\nand identifies who may legitimately wage war. Book Two deals with the\ncauses of war, the origins of property, the transfer of rights and\nmore, while Book Three is dedicated primarily to the rightful conduct\nof belligerents in war. After the initial publication in 1625, Grotius\nushered several more editions to press during his life, each time\nadding more references without substantially changing the arguments.\n(A word of explanation about citations to the DIB they\ncommonly take the form of book, chapter, section and\u2014where\napplicable\u2014paragraph; so, \u201cI.1.10.1\u201d means\n\u201cBook One, Chapter One, Section Ten, Paragraph One\u201d.)\n",
