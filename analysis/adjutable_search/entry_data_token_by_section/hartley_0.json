Reception of the Observations on Man\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Hartley\u2019s Observations\nwas valued very highly by people within the realm of religious\ndissent, scientific progress, and social reform. Writing in 1774,\nJoseph Priestley, a leading Unitarian and the foremost scientist in\nBritain, wrote that the Observations \u201ccontains a new\nand most extensive science\u201d and promised that \u201cthe study\nof it \u2026 will be like entering upon a new world.\u201d He\nadded: \u201cI think myself more indebted to this one treatise, than\nto all the books I ever read beside; the scriptures excepted\u201d\n(1774, xix).\n\nPriestley and his fellow Unitarians gave the Observations a\ncentral place in the curriculum in the dissenting academies. (For\nadmission to Oxford and Cambridge Universities, a student had to\nsubscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England\u2014a\nrequirement which excluded Unitarians, who did not accept that Jesus\nis God; hence the dissenters\u2019 need for their own institutions of\nhigher learning.) From one report, we learn that students in one\nacademy studied it for two hours every morning. In addition, in the\nlate 1700s student radicals at Cambridge and Oxford also had their\ncopies.\n\nThus the Observations was the focus of sustained study and\nhigh esteem\u2014if you followed Priestley, the most important book,\nafter the Bible. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, converted to\nPriestleian Unitarianism at Cambridge, had his portrait painted\nholding a copy of the Observations (see Paley 1999,\n18\u201323), and named his first son David Hartley Coleridge. Other\nwriters offer similar testimonies. Few works discussed in this\nencyclopedia have been the objects of such deep personal\ninvolvement.\n\nWhile its admirers thought it \u201ca new science\u201d of human\nnature, its critics\u2014including Thomas Reid (1785, 84\u201394)\nand the later Coleridge ([1817] 1983), no longer the youthful\nradical\u2014considered Hartley\u2019s Observations\nconceptually wrong and morally hazardous. For example, Sir James\nMackintosh, who sympathetically praised \u201cthe extraordinary value\nof Hartley\u2019s system\u201d (1836, 253), nonetheless saw in\nHartley\u2019s belief that consciousness derives from neurological\nprocesses an \u201cerror \u2026 deeper and more fundamental than\nany other,\u201d sure to \u201cinvolv[e] all nature in darkness and\nconfusion\u201d (245).\n\nIn the nineteenth century, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and William\nB. Carpenter (who all had studied the Observations in\ndissenting academies), along with Alexander Bain, founded the school\nof thought known as \u201cassociation psychology.\u201d They\ncredited Hartley with being the precursor of the science they had\ndeveloped. However, John Stuart Mill wrote in the Preface to the 1869\nedition of his father\u2019s Analysis of the Phenomena of the\nHuman Mind, that, compared to his father\u2019s work,\nHartley\u2019s Observations \u201cis little more than a\nsketch, though an eminently suggestive one\u201d (Mill 1869,\n1:xi\u201312). Hardly a recommendation to read the book that the\nMills had poured over as students. Why look at the sketch, when the\nfully drawn portrait is available?\n\nBy the late 1800s Priestleian Unitarianism, as a tradition of\nphilosophical practice, had died out; academic philosophers,\nespecially those trained in the Scottish school of common sense (the\nofficial philosophy taught, for example, by the Unitarians who ran\nHarvard), knew that the Observations rested on a fundamental\nmistake; and association psychologists preserved a memory of this\nprecursor of their science. Formal interest in Hartley\u2019s\nObservations, as a work to be read and pondered, discussed in\nlectures, written about in articles and books, had collapsed. The last\nserious engagement with the Observations appears in William\nJames\u2019s Principles of Psychology (1890, 1:553), and\neven there a casual reader could easily miss it.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Hartley\u2019s Observations\nremained outside the philosophical curriculum:\nphilosophers-in-training could follow the well-traveled route from the\n\u201cBritish empiricists\u201d to Kant without turning aside to\npick it up. And even if a person had wanted to, doing so was\ndifficult, for after the editions of 1749, 1775, 1791, 1810, and 1834,\nand translations into French (1755 and 1802), German (1772), and\nItalian (1809), no further editions were published. Today, paperback\nreprints of earlier editions are available, but there is no modern\ncritical edition.\n\nIn his Second Treatise of Government, Locke famously stated\nthat \u201clabor fixes property.\u201d It is the labor of people in\nthe fields of philosophy that fixes a philosophical text as a\n\u201cproperty\u201d\u2014that marks its bounds and assesses its\nvalue. But a work that has remained outside contemporary\nphilosophy\u2019s pedagogical economy, as has Hartley\u2019s\nObservations, is in an indeterminate position. A person today\nwho picks the book up would have in hand a long book covering a\nmultitude of topics. How to determine its properties? And how to\nanswer the question of economics: What is its worth? To address these\nquestions, let us imagine how one of Hartley\u2019s colleagues, a\nFellow of the Royal Society (FRS), might have responded to the book on\nits appearance in 1749.\n",
