The Concept of Discrimination\n\n\nWhat is discrimination? More specifically, what does it mean to\ndiscriminate against some person or group of persons? It\nis best to approach this question in stages, beginning with an answer\nthat is a first approximation and then introducing additions,\nqualifications, and refinements as further questions come into\nview.\n1.1 A First Approximation\n\n\nIn his review of the international treaties that outlaw discrimination,\nWouter Vandenhole finds that \u201c[t]here is no universally accepted\ndefinition of discrimination\u201d (2005: 33). In fact, the core\nhuman rights documents fail to define discrimination at all, simply\nproviding non-exhaustive lists of the grounds on which discrimination\nis to be prohibited. Thus, the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights declares that \u201cthe law shall prohibit any\ndiscrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective\nprotection against discrimination on any ground such as race, color,\nsex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social\norigin, property, birth or other status\u201d (Article 26). And\nthe European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights declares,\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this\nConvention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such\nas sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion,\nnational or social origin, association with a national minority,\nproperty, birth or other status\u201d (Article 14). Left\nunaddressed is the question of what discrimination itself is.\n\n\nStandard accounts hold that discrimination consists of actions,\npractices, or policies that are\u2014in some appropriate\nsense\u2014based on the (perceived) social group to which those\ndiscriminated against belong and that the relevant groups must be\nsocially salient in that they structure interaction in important\nsocial contexts (cf. Lippert-Rasmussen 2006: 169, and Holroyd 2018:\n384).  Thus, groups based on race, religion and gender qualify as\npotential grounds of discrimination in any modern society, but groups\nbased on the length of a person\u2019s toenails would typically not\nqualify.  However, Eidelson has challenged the social salience\nrequirement (2015: 28\u201330), and a sound understanding of what makes\ndiscrimination wrongful might depend on how the challenge is resolved.\nEidelson\u2019s view is examined in section 4.1 below. In the\nmeantime, the analysis of discrimination presented here will proceed\non the basis of the social salience requirement.\n\n\nDiscrimination against persons, then, is necessarily oriented toward\nthem based on their membership in a certain type of social group.  But\nit is also necessary that the discriminatory conduct impose some kind\nof disadvantage, harm, or wrong on the persons at whom it is\ndirected. In this connection, consider the landmark opinion of the\nU.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, holding\nthat de jure racial segregation in public schools is\nunconstitutional. The Court writes, \u201cSegregation with the\nsanction of law \u2026 has a tendency to [retard] the educational\nand mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some\nof the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school\nsystem\u201d (1954: 495). Thus, the court rules that segregation\namounts to illegal discrimination against black children because it\nimposes on them educational and psychological disadvantages.\n\n\nAdditionally, as Brown makes clear, the disadvantage imposed\nby discrimination is to be determined relative to some appropriate\ncomparison social group. This essential reference to a comparison\ngroup explains why duties of non-discrimination are \u201cduties to\ntreat people in certain ways defined by reference to the way that\nothers are treated\u201d (Gardner 1998: 355). Typically, the\nrelevant comparison group is part of the same society as the\ndisadvantaged group, or at least it is governed by the same overarching\npolitical structure. In Brown, the relevant comparison\ngroup consisted of white citizens. Accordingly, it would be\nmistaken to think that the black citizens of Kansas who brought the\nlawsuit were not discriminated against because they were treated no\nworse than blacks in South Africa were being treated under\napartheid. Blacks in South Africa were not the proper comparison\nclass.\n\n\nThe appropriate comparison class is determined by normative\nprinciples. American states are obligated to provide their black\ncitizens an education that is no worse than what they provide to their\nwhite citizens; any comparison with the citizens or subjects of other\ncountries is beside the point. It should also be noted that,\nwhether or not American states have an obligation to provide an\neducation to any of their citizens, if such states provide an education\nto their white citizens, then it is discriminatory for the states to\nfail to provide an equally good education to their black\ncitizens. And if states do have an obligation to provide\nan education to all their citizens, then giving an education to whites\nbut not blacks would constitute a double-wrong against blacks: the\nwrong of discrimination, which depends on how blacks are treated in\ncomparison to whites, and the wrong of denying blacks an education,\nwhich does not depend on how whites are treated.\n\n\nDiscrimination is necessarily comparative, and the Brown case\nseems to suggest that what counts in the comparison is not how well or\npoorly a person (or group) is treated on some absolute scale, but\nrather how well she is treated relative to some other person.  But an\nimportant element of the court\u2019s reasoning in Brown\nsuggests that the disadvantage or wrong imposed by a discriminatory\nact can encompass more than the harmful downstream causal consequences\nof the act. Thus, the Court famously writes, \u201cSeparate\neducational facilities are inherently unequal\u201d (1954: 495). The\nCourt can be construed as saying that, apart from the harmful\neducational and psychological consequences for black children, the Jim\nCrow segregation of public schools stamps those children with a badge\nof inferiority and thereby treats them unfavorably in comparison to\nwhite children.\n\n\nIt is important to recognize that discrimination, in the morally and\nsocially relevant sense, is not simply differential treatment.\nDifferential treatment is symmetrical: if blacks are treated\ndifferently from whites, then whites must be treated differently from\nblacks. But it is implausible to hold that Jim Crow and South Africa\u2019s\napartheid system discriminated against whites. The system arguably\nheld back economic progress for everyone in the South, but that point\nis quite different from the implausible claim that everyone was a\nvictim of discrimination.  Accordingly, it is better to think of\ndiscrimination in terms of disadvantageous treatment rather than\nsimply differential treatment. Discrimination imposes a disadvantage\non certain persons relative to others, and those who are treated more\nfavorably are not to be seen as victims of discrimination.\n\n\nAn act can both be discriminatory and, simultaneously, confer an\nabsolute benefit on those discriminated against, because the conferral\nof the benefit might be combined with conferring a greater benefit on\nthe members of the appropriate comparison group. In such a case,\nthe advantage of receiving an absolute benefit is, at the same time, a\nrelative disadvantage or deprivation. For example,\nconsider the admissions policy of Harvard University in the early\ntwentieth century, when the university had a quota on the number of\nJewish students. Harvard was guilty of discriminating against all\nJewish applicants on account of their religion. Yet, the\nuniversity still offered the applicants something of substantial value,\nviz., the opportunity to compete successfully for admission. What\nmade the university\u2019s offer of this opportunity discriminatory\nwas that the quota placed (potential and actual) Jewish applicants at a\ndisadvantage, due to their religion, relative to Christian ones.\n\n\nOne might think that it downplays the harm done by discrimination to\nsay that the disadvantage it imposes only need be a relative\ndisadvantage. However, the Brown case shows how the\nimposition of even a \u201cmerely\u201d relative disadvantage can\nhave extremely bad and unjust consequences for persons, especially\nwhen the relevant comparison class consists of one\u2019s fellow\ncitizens. Disadvantages relative to fellow citizens, when those\ndisadvantages are severe and concern important goods such as education\nand social status, can make persons vulnerable to domination and\noppression at the hands of their fellow citizens (Anderson 1999). The\ndomination and oppression of American blacks by their fellow citizens\nunder Jim Crow was made easier by the relative disadvantage imposed on\nblacks when it came to education. Norwegians might have had an even\nbetter education than southern whites, but Norwegians posed little\nthreat of domination to southern whites or blacks, because they lived\nunder an entirely separate political structure, having minimal\nrelations to American citizens. Matters are different in today\u2019s\nglobalized world, where an individual\u2019s disadvantage in access\nto education relative to persons who live in other countries could\npose a threat of oppression. Accordingly, one must seriously consider\nthe possibility that children from poor countries are being\ndiscriminated against when they are unable to obtain the education\nroutinely available to children in affluent societies. \n\n\nThe relative nature of the disadvantage that discrimination imposes\nexplains the close connection between discrimination and\ninequality. A relative disadvantage necessarily involves an\ninequality with respect to persons in the comparison class.\nAccordingly, antidiscrimination norms prohibit certain sorts of\ninequalities between persons in the relevant comparison classes (Shin\n2009).  For example, the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1866 requires\nthat all citizens \u201cshall have the same right, in every State and\nTerritory in the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue,\nbe parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold,\nand convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of\nall laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is\nenjoyed by white citizens\u201d (Civil Rights Act 1866). And the\ninternational convention targeting discrimination against women\ncondemns \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the\nbasis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying\nthe recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women \u2026 on a basis of\nequality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms\u201d (CEDAW, Article 1).\n\n\nTo review: as a reasonable first approximation, we can say that\ndiscrimination consists of acts, practices, or policies that impose a\nrelative disadvantage on persons based on their membership in a salient\nsocial group. But notice that this account does not make\ndiscrimination morally wrong as a conceptual matter. The\nimposition of a relative disadvantage might, or might not, be\nwrongful. In the next section, we will see how the idea of moral\nwrongfulness can be introduced to form a moralized concept of\ndiscrimination.\n\n\nIn recent years, some thinkers have rejected the view that\ndiscrimination is an essentially comparative concept that looks to how\ncertain persons are treated relative to others. For example,\nR\u00e9aume argues against the view by invoking the\n\u201cleveling-down objection.\u201d She points out that, if there\nis an inequality in the distribution of some benefit between two\npersons or groups, then we need to ask \u201cwhether leveling up or\nleveling down are, other things held constant, regarded as equally\nattractive solutions\u201d (2013: 8). The comparative view seems to\nentail that the two solutions are equally attractive, but,\nR\u00e9aume points out, plaintiffs in discrimination cases who are\ndemanding equal treatment \u201crarely put their claim this\nway\u201d (8) and would not be satisfied with the leveling-down\nsolution: \u201cthey ask to vote as well, not that voting be\nabolished, or that a pension scheme include them, not that it be\nrepealed.\u201d R\u00e9aume continues, \u201cTo level down would\ndeprive everyone of something all are properly entitled to, and thus\nexacerbate rather than solve the problem\u201d (11).\n\n\nNonetheless, the leveling-down objection is problematic. That\nplaintiffs in discrimination cases do not ask that voting be abolished\nonly shows that they know that they would be better off with everyone\nhaving the right to vote than with no one having it. Moreover,\nalthough leveling down would, in typical cases, deprive everyone of\nsomething to which all are entitled, it does not follow that leveling\ndown would constitute discrimination. The universal denial of the\nfranchise would be a wrong, but not the wrong of\ndiscrimination. Denial of the franchise amounts to discrimination only\nwhen it is selectively directed at some salient group within the adult\npopulation. Accordingly, Lippert-Rasmussen seems to be right when he\nexplains, \u201cUnlike other prima facie morally wrong acts, such as\nlying, hurting, or manipulating, one cannot discriminate against some\nunless there are others who receive (or who would receive) better\ntreatment at one\u2019s hands \u2026. I can rebut an accusation of\nhaving discriminated against someone by saying that I would have\ntreated anyone else at least as badly in that situation\u201d (2014:\n16).\n1.2 The Moralized Concept\n\n\nThe concept of discrimination is inherently normative to the extent\nthat the idea of disadvantage is a normative one. But it does not\nfollow from this point that discrimination is, by definition, morally\nwrong. At the same time, many\u2014or even most\u2014uses of the\nterm \u2018discrimination\u2019 in contemporary political and legal\ndiscussions do employ the term in a moralized sense. Wasserman is\nusing this moralized sense, when he writes that \u201c[t]o claim that\nsomeone discriminates is \u2026 to challenge her for justification;\nto call discrimination \u2018wrongful\u2019 is merely to add\nemphasis to a morally-laden term\u201d (1998: 805). We can, in fact,\ndistinguish a moralized from a non-moralized concept of\ndiscrimination. The moralized concept picks out acts, practices or\npolicies insofar as they wrongfully impose a relative\ndisadvantage on persons based on their membership in a salient social\ngroup of a suitable sort.  The non-moralized concept simply dispenses\nwith the adverb \u2018wrongfully\u2019.\n\n\nAccordingly, the sentence \u2018Discrimination is wrong\u2019 can be\neither a tautology (if \u2018discrimination\u2019 is used in its\nmoralized sense) or a substantive moral judgment (if\n\u2018discrimination\u2019 is used in its non- moralized\nsense). And if one wanted to condemn as wrong a certain act or\npractice, then one could call it \u2018discrimination\u2019 (in the\nmoralized sense) and leave it at that, or one could call it\n\u2018discrimination\u2019 (in the non-moralized sense) and then add\nthat it was wrongful. In contexts where the justifiability of an\nact or practice is under discussion and disagreement, the moralized\nconcept of discrimination is typically the key one used, and the\ndisagreement is over whether the concept applies to the act.\nBecause of its role in such discussion and disagreement, the remainder\nof this article will be concerned with the moralized concept of\ndiscrimination, unless it is explicitly indicated otherwise.\n\n\nThere is an additional point that needs to be made in connection with\nthe wrongfulness of discrimination in its moralized sense. It is\nnot simply that such discrimination is wrongful as a conceptual\nmatter. The wrongfulness of the discrimination is tied to the\nfact that the discriminatory act is based on the victim\u2019s\nmembership in a salient social group. An act that imposes a\nrelative disadvantage or deprivation might be wrong for a variety of\nreasons; for example, the act might violate a promise that the agent\nhas made. The act counts as discrimination, though, only insofar\nas its wrongfulness derives from a connection of the act to the\nmembership in a certain group(s) of the person detrimentally affected\nby the act. Accordingly, we can refine the first-approximation\naccount of discrimination and say that the moralized concept\nof discrimination is properly applied to acts, practices or policies\nthat meet two conditions: a) they wrongfully impose a relative\ndisadvantage or deprivation on persons based on their membership in\nsome salient social group, and b) the wrongfulness rests (in part) on\nthe fact that the imposition of the disadvantage is on account of the\ngroup membership of the victims.\n2. Types of Discrimination (in its Moralized Sense)\n\n\nLegal thinkers and legal systems have distinguished among a bewildering\narray of types of discrimination: direct and indirect, disparate\ntreatment and disparate impact, intentional and institutional,\nindividual and structural. It is not easy to make sense of the morass\nof categories and distinctions. The best place to start is\nwith direct discrimination.\n2.1 Direct Discrimination\n\n\nConsider the following, clear instance of direct discrimination.  In\n2002, several men of Roma descent entered a bar in a Romanian town and\nwere refused service. The bar employee explained his conduct by\npointing out to them a sign saying, \u201cWe do not serve\nRoma.\u201d The Romanian tribunal deciding the case ruled that the\nRoma men had been the victims of unlawful direct\ndiscrimination (Schiek, Waddington, & Bell 2007: 185). The\nbar\u2019s policy, as formulated in its sign, explicitly and\nintentionally picked out the Roma qua Roma for disadvantageous\ntreatment. It was those two features\u2014explicitness and\nintention\u2014that made the Roma case a paradigmatic example of\ndirect discrimination. Such examples of discrimination are cases in\nwhich the agent acts with the aim of imposing a disadvantage on\npersons for being members of some salient social group. In the Roma\ncase, the bartender and bar owner aimed to exclude Roma for being\nRoma, and so both the owner\u2019s policy and the bartender\u2019s\nmaxim of action explicitly referred to the exclusion of Roma. It is\nclear that the policy of the bar was wrong, but the question of what\nmakes the policy and other instances direct discrimination wrongful\nwill be put on hold until section 4.1 below.\n\n\nIn some cases, a discriminator will adopt a policy that, on its face,\nmakes no explicit reference to the group that he or she aims to\ndisadvantage. Instead, the policy employs some facially-neutral\nsurrogate that, when applied, accomplishes the discriminator\u2019s\nhidden aim. For example, during the Jim Crow era, southern states\nused literacy tests for the purpose of excluding African-Americans from\nthe franchise. Because African-Americans were denied adequate\neducational opportunities and because the tests were applied in a\nracially-biased manner, virtually all of the persons disqualified by\nthe tests were African-Americans, and, in any given jurisdiction, the\nvast majority of African-American adults seeking to vote were\ndisqualified. The point of the literacy tests was precisely such\nracial exclusion, even though the testing policy made no explicit\nreference to race.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the absence of an explicit reference to race in the\nliteracy tests themselves, their use was a case of direct\ndiscrimination. The reason is that the persons who formulated,\nvoted for, and implemented the tests acted on maxims that did\nmake explicit reference to race. Their maxim was something along\nthe lines of: \u2018In order to exclude African-Americans from the\nfranchise and do so in a way that appears consistent with the U.S.\nConstitution, I will favor a legal policy that is racially-neutral on\nits face but in practice excludes most African-Americans and leaves\nwhites unaffected.\u2019 As with the Roma case, there were\nagents whose aim was to disadvantage persons for belonging to a certain\nsocial group.\n\n\nHowever, it is too simple to say that direct discrimination\nsimply is intentional discrimination. Lippert-Rasmussen\nrightly points out that there can be cases of direct discrimination\nnot involving the intention to disadvantage anyone on account of her\ngroup membership (2014: 59\u201360). A disadvantage might, instead,\nbe imposed as a result of a general indifference toward the interests\nand rights of the members of a certain group.  Thus, an employer might\nuse hiring criteria that unfairly disadvantages women, not because the\nemployer intends to disadvantage women, but because the criteria are\neasy to use and he simply does not care that women are unfairly\ndisadvantaged as a result.  Such instances of discrimination might not\nhave the paradigmatic status that an example like the Roma case has,\nbut they should be counted as forms of direct discrimination, because\nthe disadvantageous treatment derives from an objectionable mental\nstate of the agent.  The same goes for disadvantageous treatment that\nis the product of bias against a certain group, even when the bias\ndoes not involve an intention to treat the group disadvantageously.  A\npaternalistic employer might intend to help women by hiring them only\nfor certain jobs in his company, but, if the employer is motivated by\nunwarranted views about the capabilities of women, he is guilty of\ndirect discrimination.\n\n\nActs of direct discrimination can be unconscious in that the agent is\nunaware of the discriminatory motive behind them.  It is plausible to\nthink that in many societies, unconscious prejudice is a factor in a\nsignificant range of discriminatory behavior, and a viable\nunderstanding of the concept of discrimination must be able to\naccommodate the possibility. In fact, there is growing evidence that\nunconscious discrimination exists (Jost et al. 2009; Payne and Cameron\n2010; and Brownstein and Saul 2016).  And as Wax has noted, even the\nintention to disadvantage persons on account of their group\naffiliation can be unconscious (2008: 983).\n2.2 Indirect Discrimination\n\n\nUnder many legal systems, an act that imposes a disproportionate\ndisadvantage on the members of a certain group can count as\ndiscriminatory, even though the agent has no intention to disadvantage\nthe members of the group and no other objectionable mental state, such\nas indifference or bias, motivating the act.  This form of\ndiscriminatory conduct is called \u201cindirect discrimination\u201d\nor, in the language of American doctrine, \u201cdisparate\nimpact\u201d discrimination. Thus, the European Court of Human Rights\n(ECHR) has held that \u201c[w]hen a general policy or measure has\ndisproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group, it is\nnot excluded that this may be considered as discriminatory\nnotwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed or directed at that\ngroup\u201d (Shanaghan v. U.K. 2001: para. 129).\n\n\nIt should be noted that the ECHR says that policies with\ndisproportionate effects may be discriminatory even if that is\nnot the aim of the policies. So what criterion determines when a\npolicy with disproportionately worse effects on a certain group\nactually counts as indirect discrimination? There is no agreed\nupon answer.\n\n\nThe ECHR has laid down the following criterion: a policy with\ndisproportionate effects counts as indirect discrimination \u201cif\nit does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable\nrelation of proportionality between means and aim\u201d (Abdulaziz et\nal. v. U.K., 1985: para. 721). The Human Rights Committee of the\nUnited Nations has judged that a policy with disproportionate effects\nis discriminatory \u201cif it is not based on objective and\nreasonable criteria\u201d (Moucheboeuf 2006: 100).  Under the British\nRace Relations Act, such a policy is discriminatory if the policymaker\n\u201ccannot show [the policy] to be justifiable irrespective of the\n\u2026 race \u2026 of the person to whom it is applied\u201d\n(Osin and Porat 2005: 900). And in its interpretation of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that, in judging\nwhether the employment policies of private businesses are (indirectly)\ndiscriminatory, \u201c[i]f an employment practice which operates to\nexclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the\npractice is prohibited\u201d (Griggs v. Duke Power 1971:\n431).  Despite the differences, these criteria have a common thought\nbehind them: a disproportionately disadvantageous impact on the\nmembers of certain salient social groups must not be written off as\nmorally or legally irrelevant or dismissed as mere accident, but\nrather stands in need of justification. In other words, the impact\nmust not be treated as wholly inconsequential, as if it were\nequivalent, for example, to a disproportionate impact on persons with\nlong toe nails. Toe-nail group impact would require no justification,\nbecause it would simply be an accidental and morally inconsequential\nfeature of the act, at least in all actual societies. In contrast, the\nthought behind the idea of indirect discrimination is that, if an act\nhas a disproportionately disadvantageous impact on persons belonging\nto certain types of salient social groups, then the act is morally\nwrong and prohibited by anti-discrimination law unless it can meet\nsome suitable standard of justification.\n\n\nTo illustrate the idea of indirect discrimination, we can turn to the\nU.S. Supreme Court case, Griggs v. Duke Power (1971). A\ncompany in North Carolina used a written test to determine\npromotions. The use of the test had the result that almost all black\nemployees failed to qualify for the promotions. The company was not\naccused of direct discrimination, i.e., there was no claim that a\nracially discriminatory attitude was behind the decision of the\ncompany to use the written test. But the court found that the test did\nnot measure skills essential for the jobs in question and that the\nstate of North Carolina had a long history of deliberately\ndiscriminating against blacks by, among other things, providing\ngrossly inferior education to them. The state had only very recently\nbegun to rectify that situation. In ruling for the black plaintiffs,\nthe court reasoned that the policy of using the test was racially\ndiscriminatory, because of the test\u2019s disproportionate racial\nimpact combined with the fact that it was not necessary to use the\ntest to determine who was best qualified for promotion.\n2.3 Organizational, Institutional, and Structural Discrimination\n\n\nIn many cases, acts of discrimination are attributed to collective\nagents, rather than to natural persons acting in their individual\ncapacities. Accordingly, corporations, universities, government\nagencies, religious bodies, and other collective agents can act in\ndiscriminatory ways. This kind of discrimination can be called\n\u201corganizational,\u201d and it cuts across the direct-indirect\ndistinction. Confusion sometimes arises when it is mistakenly believed\nthat organizations cannot have intentions and that only indirect\ndiscrimination is possible for them. As collective agents,\norganizations do have intentions, and those intentions are a function\nof who the officially authorized agents of the institution are and\nwhat they are trying to do when they act as their official powers\nenable them. Suppose that the Board of Trustees of a university votes\nto adopt an admissions policy that (implicitly or explicitly) excludes\nJews, and the trustees vote that way precisely because they believe\nthat Jews are inherently more dishonest and greedy than other\npeople. In such a cases, the university is deliberately\nexcluding Jews and is guilty of direct discrimination. Individual\ntrustees acting in their private capacity might engage in other forms\nof discriminatory conduct; for example, they might refuse to join\nclubs that have Jewish members. Such a refusal would not count as\norganizational discrimination. But any discriminatory acts\nattributable to individual board members in virtue of some official\npower that they hold would count as organizational discrimination.\n\n\nStructural discrimination\u2014sometimes called\n\u201cinstitutional\u201d (Ture and Hamilton 1992 [1967]:\n4)\u2014should be distinguished from organizational: the structural\nform concerns the rules that constitute and regulate the major sectors\nof life such as family relations, property ownership and exchange,\npolitical powers and responsibilities, and so on (Pogge 2008: 37). It\nis true that when such rules are discriminatory, they are\noften\u2014though not always\u2014the deliberate product of some\ncollective or individual agent, such as a legislative body or\nexecutive official. In such cases, the agents are guilty of direct\ndiscrimination. But the idea of structural discrimination is an effort\nto capture a wrong distinct from direct discrimination.  Thus, Fred\nPincus writes that \u201c[t]he key element in structural\ndiscrimination is not the intent but the effect of keeping minority\ngroups in a subordinate position\u201d (1994: 84). What Pincus and\nothers have in mind can be explained in the following way.\n\n\nWhen the rules of a society\u2019s major institutions reliably\nproduce disproportionately disadvantageous outcomes for the members of\ncertain salient social groups and the production of such outcomes is\nunjust, then there is structural discrimination against the members of\nthe groups in question, apart from any direct discrimination in which\nthe collective or individual agents of the society might engage.\nThis account does not mean that, empirically speaking, structural\ndiscrimination stands free of direct discrimination. It is highly\nunlikely that the reliable production of unjust and\ndisproportionately disadvantageous effects would be a chance\noccurrence. Rather, it is (almost) always the case that, at some\npoint(s) in the history of a society in which there is structural\ndiscrimination, important collective agents, such as governmental ones,\nintentionally created rules with the aim of disadvantaging the members\nof the groups in question. It is also likely that some collective\nand individual agents continue to engage in direct discrimination in\nsuch a society. But by invoking the idea of structural\ndiscrimination and attributing the discrimination to the rules of a\nsociety\u2019s major institutions, we are pointing to a form of\ndiscrimination that is conceptually distinct from the direct\ndiscrimination engaged in by collective or individual agents. Thus\nunderstood, structural discrimination is, as a conceptual matter,\nnecessarily indirect, although, as an empirical matter, direct\ndiscrimination is (almost) always part of the story of how structural\ndiscrimination came to be and continues to exist.\n\n\nAlso note that the idea of structural discrimination does not\npresuppose that, whenever the rules of society\u2019s major\ninstitutions consistently produce disproportionately disadvantageous\nresults for a salient group such as women or racial minorities,\nstructural discrimination thereby exists. Because our concern is\nwith the moralized concept of discrimination, one might think that\ndisproportionate outcomes, by themselves, entail that an injustice has\nbeen done to the members of the salient group in question and that\nstructural discrimination thereby exists against the group.\nHowever, on a moralized concept of structural discrimination, the\ninjustice condition is distinct from the disproportionate outcome\ncondition. Whether a disproportionate outcome is sufficient for\nconcluding that there is an injustice against the members of the group\nis a substantive moral question. Some thinkers might claim that\nthe answer is affirmative, and such a claim is consistent with the\nmoralized concept of structural discrimination. However, the\nclaim is not presupposed by the moralized concept, which incorporates\nonly the conceptual thesis that a pattern of disproportionate\ndisadvantage falling on the members of certain salient groups does not\ncount as structural discrimination unless the pattern violates sound\nprinciples of distributive justice.\n3. Challenging the Concept of Indirect Discrimination\n\n\nThe distinction between direct and indirect discrimination plays a\ncentral role in contemporary thinking about discrimination.  However,\nsome philosophers hold that talking about indirect discrimination is\nconfused and misguided. For these philosophers, direct discrimination\nis the only genuine form of discrimination.  Examining their challenge\nto the very concept of indirect discrimination is crucial in\ndeveloping a philosophical account of what discrimination is.\n3.1 Is Indirect Discrimination Really Discrimination?\n\n\nYoung argues that the concept of discrimination should be limited to\n\u201cintentional and explicitly formulated policies of exclusion or\npreference.\u201d She holds that conceiving of discrimination in\nterms of the consequences or impact of an act, rather than in terms of\nits intent, \u201cconfuses issues\u201d by conflating discrimination\nwith oppression. Discrimination is a matter of the intentional conduct\nof particular agents. Oppression is a matter of the outcomes routinely\ngenerated by \u201cthe structural and institutional framework\u201d\nof society (1990: 196).\n\n\nCavanagh holds a position similar to Young\u2019s, writing that\npersons \u201cwho are concerned primarily with how things like race\nand sex show up in the overall distributions [of jobs] have no\nbusiness saying that their position has anything to do with\ndiscrimination. It is not discrimination they object to, but its\neffects; and these effects can equally be brought about by other\ncauses\u201d (2002: 199). On Cavanagh\u2019s view, then, if one finds it\ninherently objectionable for political officeholders to be\npredominantly male, then one can sensibly charge that such a\ndisproportion is unjust but cannot coherently claim that it is, in\nitself, discriminatory.\n\n\nAlong the same lines, Eidelson contends that\n\u201c\u2018indirect\u2019 discrimination is not usefully thought\nof as a distinct form of discrimination at all, except as a piece of\nlegal jargon\u201d (2015: 19).  He writes, \u201cPrecisely because\nthe connotation of \u2018discrimination\u2019 as an act \u2026 in\nwhich an agent is sensitive to some feature of the discriminatee, and\nengages in some manner of differential treatment, is inescapable,\ndescribing indirect discrimination as discrimination is a serious\nobstacle to clear communication\u201d (56).\n\n\nThe arguments of Cavanagh, Eidelson and Young raise a question that is not easy\nto answer, viz., why can indirect and direct discrimination be\nlegitimately considered as two subcategories of one and the same\nconcept? In other words, what do the two supposed forms of\ndiscrimination really have in common that make them forms of the same\ntype of moral wrong? Direct discrimination is essentially a\nmatter of the reasons or motives that guide the act or policy of a\nparticular agent, while indirect discrimination is not about such\nreasons or motives. Even conceding that acts or policies of\neach type can be wrong, it is unclear that the two types are each\nspecies of one and the same kind of moral wrong, i.e., the wrong of\ndiscrimination. And if cases of direct discrimination are\nparadigmatic examples of discrimination, then a serious question arises\nas to whether the concept of discrimination properly applies to the\npolicies, rules, and acts that are characterized as\n\u201cindirect\u201d discrimination.\n\n\nMoreover, there is a crucial ambiguity in how discrimination is\nunderstood that lends itself to conflating direct discrimination with\nthe phenomena picked out by \u2018indirect\ndiscrimination\u2019. Direct discrimination involves the\nimposition of disadvantages \u201cbased on\u201d or \u201con account\nof\u201d or \u201cbecause of\u201d membership in some salient social\ngroup. Yet, these phrases can refer either to a) the reasons that\nguide the acts of agents or to b) factors that do not guide agents but\ndo help explain why the disadvantageous outcomes of certain acts and\npolicies fall disproportionately on certain salient groups (Cf. Shin\n2010). In the Roma case, the disadvantage was \u201cbecause\nof\u201d ethnicity in the former sense: the ethnicity of the\nRoma was a consideration that guided the acts of the bar owner and\nbartender. In the Griggs case, the disadvantage was\n\u201cbecause of race\u201d in the latter sense: race did not\nguide the acts of the company but neither was it an accident that the\ndisadvantages of the written test fell disproportionately on\nblacks. Rather, race, in conjunction with the historical\nfacts about North Carolina\u2019s educational policies, explained why\nthe disadvantage fell disproportionately on black employees.\n\n\nThe thought that the policy of the company in Griggs is a kind of\ndiscrimination, viz., indirect discrimination, seems to trade on the\nambiguity in the meanings of the locutions \u2018based on\u2019,\n\u2018because of\u2019, \u2018on account of\u2019, and so on.\nThe state of North Carolina\u2019s policy of racial segregation in\neducation imposed disadvantages based on/because of/on account of race,\nin one sense of those terms. The company\u2019s policy of using\na written test imposed disadvantages based on/because of/on account of\nrace, in a different sense. Even conceding that both the state\nand the company wronged blacks on the basis of their race, it appears\nthat the two cases present two different kinds of wrong.\n\nNonetheless, the idea of indirect discrimination can help to highlight\nhow the wrongful harms of direct discrimination are capable of\nramifying via acts and policies that are not directly discriminatory\nand would be entirely innocent but for the link between them and acts\nof direct discrimination.  In the Griggs case, direct discrimination\nhad harmed blacks by putting them at an educational disadvantage.\nEven if the direct discrimination had ceased at some prior point, the\npolicy of the company enabled the educational disadvantage to branch\ninto an employment disadvantage, thereby amplifying and perpetuating\nthe wrongful harms of the original direct discrimination.  The\nlanguage of indirect discrimination can spotlight the link between the\ntwo forms of disadvantage and capture the idea that the wrongful harms\nof direct discrimination should not be allowed to extend willy-nilly\nacross time and domains of life via otherwise innocent acts. \n\nHowever, it is also true that the idea of indirect discrimination is\ntypically understood in a broader way that does not require any\nconnection to direct discrimination.  Accordingly, in his discussion\nof how persons adhering to certain religious beliefs or practices\nmight be put at an unjust disadvantage by an employer\u2019s dress\ncode, Jones writes, \u201cIndirect discrimination law aims \u2026\nto eliminate inequalities of opportunity arising from religion or\nbelief\u201d (170).  For example, if a code excludes a form of dress\nthat persons adhering to a particular religion regard as\ntheologically-favored, such as head coverings or veils, then the\nBritish law of indirect discrimination requires that the company grant\nan exemption to those persons, unless it can show that the code is a\nproportionate means for achieving a legitimate aim.  On Jones\u2019s\nview, the law thereby counters, albeit in a limited way, an unjust\nburden placed on certain religious adherents and promotes equal\nemployment opportunity.\n\nThe critics of the idea of indirect discrimination think that Jones is\nconflating distinct wrongs: the right of equal opportunity can be\nviolated by discrimination, but it can also be violated by other sorts\nof wrongs.  Even if certain dress codes violate the right and do so in\na way that tracks a particular religious identity, it does not follow\nthat the codes are cases of wrongful discrimination.  But Jones can\nrespond that, as long as the wrongful treatment tracks salient social\ncategories, differentially disadvantaging persons belonging to such a\ncategory, then characterizing the treatment as discrimination is in\norder.\n\n\nStill, critics will contend that the concept of indirect\ndiscrimination is problematic, because its use mistakenly presupposes\nthat the wrongfulness of discrimination can lie ultimately in its\neffects on social groups. Certainly, bad effects can be\nbrought about by discriminatory processes, but critics argue that the\nwrongfulness lies in what brings about the effects, i.e., in the\nunfairness or injustice of those acts or policies that generate the\neffects, and does not reside in the effects themselves. Addressing\nthis argument requires a closer examination of why discrimination is\nwrong, the topic of section 4. Before turning to that section, it\nwould be helpful to address a suspicion that might arise in the course\nof pondering whether indirect discrimination really is a form of\ndiscrimination.\n3.2 Is the Dispute Merely Terminological?\n\n\nOne might suspect that any disagreement over whether indirect\ndiscrimination is really a form of discrimination is only a\nterminological one, devoid of any philosophical substance and capable\nof being adequately settled simply by the speaker stipulating how she\nis using the term \u2018discrimination\u2019 (Cavanagh 2002:\n199). One side in the disagreement could, then, stipulate that, as it\nis using the term, \u2018discrimination\u2019 applies only to direct\ndiscrimination, and the other side could stipulate that\n\u2018discrimination\u2019, as it is using the term, applies to\ndirect and indirect discrimination alike. However, the choice of\nterminology is not always philosophically innocent or unproblematic. A\npoor choice of terminology can lead to conceptual confusions and\nfallacious inferences. Cavanagh argues that precisely these sorts of\ninfelicities are fostered when \u2018discrimination\u2019 is used to\nrefer to a wrong that essentially depends on certain effects being\nvisited upon the members of a social group (2002: 199). Moreover, the\ncritics and the defenders of the term \u2018indirect\ndiscrimination\u2019 presumably agree with one another that the\nconcept of discrimination possesses a determinate meaning that either\nadmits, or does not admit, of an indirect form of discrimination. So\nit seems that the disagreement over indirect discrimination has\nphilosophical significance.\n\n\nThe possibility should be acknowledged that the concept of\ndiscrimination is insufficiently determinate to dictate an answer to\nthe question of whether there can be an indirect form of\ndiscrimination. In that case, any disagreement over the possibility of\nsuch discrimination would be devoid of philosophical substance and\nshould be settled by speaker stipulation. However, it would be hasty\nto arrive at the conclusion that there is no answer before a thorough\nexamination of the concept of discrimination is completed and some\njudgment is made about what the best account is of the concept. And a\nthorough examination must take up the question of why discrimination\nis wrong.\n4. Why Is Discrimination Wrong?\n\nIn examining the question of why discrimination is wrongful, let us\nbegin with direct discrimination and then turn to the indirect\nform. This approach will help shed some light on whether the wrongs\ninvolved in the two forms are sufficiently analogous to consider them\nas two types of one and the same kind of wrong.\n4.1 The Wrongs of Direct Discrimination\n\n\nSpecifying why direct discrimination is wrongful has proved to be a\nsurprisingly controversial and difficult task. There is general\nagreement that the wrong concerns the kind of reason or motive that\nguides the action of the agent of discrimination: the agent is acting\non a reason or motive that is in some way illegitimate or morally\ntainted. But there are more than a half-dozen distinct views about\nwhat the best principle is for drawing the distinction between acts of\ndirect discrimination (in the moralized sense) and those acts that are\nnot wrongful even though the agent takes account of another\u2019s\nsocial group membership.\n\n\nOne popular view is that direct discrimination is wrong because the\ndiscriminator treats persons on the basis of traits that are immutable\nand not under the control of the individual possessing them.  Thus,\nKahlenberg asserts that racial discrimination is unjust because race\nis such an immutable trait (1996: 54\u201355). And discrimination\nbased on many forms of disability would seem to fit this view. But\nBoxill rejects the view, arguing that there are instances in which it\nis justifiable to treat persons based on features that are beyond\ntheir control (1992: 12\u201317). Denying blind people a\ndriver\u2019s license is not an injustice to them.  Moreover, Boxill\nnotes that, if scientists developed a drug that could change a\nperson\u2019s skin color, it would still be unjust to discriminate\nagainst people because of their color (1992: 16).  Additionally, a\nparadigmatic ground of discrimination, a person\u2019s religion, is\nnot an immutable trait, nor are some forms of disability. Thus, there\nare serious problems with the popular view that direct discrimination\nis wrong due to the immutable nature of the traits on the basis of\nwhich the discriminator treats the persons whom he wrongs.\n\nA second view holds that direct discrimination is wrong because it\ntreats persons on the basis of inaccurate stereotypes. When the state\nof Virginia defended the male-only admissions policy of the Virginia\nMilitary Institute (VMI), it introduced expert testimony that there\nwas a strong correlation between sex and the capacity to benefit from\nthe highly disciplined and competitive educational atmosphere of the\nschool: those who benefited from such an atmosphere were, for the most\npart, men, while women had a strong tendency to thrive in a quite\ndifferent, cooperative educational environment. This defense involved\nthe premise that the school\u2019s admissions policy was not\ndiscriminatory because the policy relied on accurate generalizations\nabout men and women. And in its ruling against VMI, the Supreme Court\nheld that a public policy \u201cmust not rely on overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females\u201d (U.S. v. Virginia\n1996: 533). But the Court went on to argue that \u201cgeneralizations\nabout \u2018the way women are\u2019, estimates of what is\nappropriate for most women, no longer justify denying\nopportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the\naverage description\u201d (550; ital. in original). \n\n\nThe Court\u2019s reasoning implies that, even if gender were a very good\npredictor of the qualities needed to benefit from and be successful at\nthe school, VMI\u2019s admissions policy would still be\ndiscriminatory (Schauer 2003: 137\u2013141).  Accordingly, on the\nCourt\u2019s view, direct discrimination based on largely accurate\ngender generalizations can still be wrongful.  For example, consider a\nfire department whose policy is to reject all women applicants for the\njob of fire fighter, on the grounds that the vast majority of persons\nhaving the requisite physical strength for the job are men and that\nthe policy saves the department the time and expense of testing\npersons unlikely to meet the requirement.  Even if the gender\ngeneralization underlying the policy is accurate, it is clear that the\npolicy amounts to wrongful discrimination against women, depriving\nthem of their right to equal employment opportunity.  Thus, the\nwrongfulness cannot be explained simply by saying that the\ngeneralization is inaccurate. \n\n\nA third view is that direct discrimination is wrong because it is an\narbitrary or irrational way to treat persons. In other words, direct\ndiscrimination imposes a disadvantage on a person for a reason that is\nnot a good one, viz., that the person is a member of a certain salient\nsocial group. Accordingly, Cotter argues that such discrimination\ntreats people unequally \u201cwithout rational justification\u201d\n(2006: 10). Kekes expresses a similar view in condemning race-based\naffirmative action as \u201carbitrary\u201d (1995: 200), and, in the\nsame vein, Flew argues that racism is unjust because it treats persons\non the basis of traits that \u201care strictly superficial and\nproperly irrelevant to all, or almost all, questions of social status\nand employability\u201d (1990: 63\u201364).\n\n\nHowever, many thinkers reject this third view of the wrongness of\ndirect discrimination. Gardner argues that there is no\n\u201cacross-the-board-duty to be rational, so our irrationality\nas such wrongs no one.\u201d Additionally, Gardner contends that\n\u201cthere patently can be reasons, under some conditions,\nto discriminate on grounds of race or sex,\u201d even though the\nconduct in question is wrongful (1998: 168). For example, a\nrestaurant owner might rationally refuse to serve blacks if most of his\ncustomers are white racists who would stop patronizing the\nestablishment if blacks were served (1998: 168 and 182). The\nowner\u2019s actions would be wrong and would amount to a rational\nform of discrimination. Additionally, Wasserstrom argues\nthat the principle that persons ought not to be treated on the basis of\nmorally arbitrary features cannot grasp the fundamental wrong of direct\nracial discrimination, because the principle is \u201ctoo contextually\nisolated\u201d from the actual features of a society in which many\npeople have racist attitudes (1995: 161). For Wasserstrom,\nthe wrong of racial discrimination cannot be separated from the fact\nthat such discrimination manifests an attitude that the members of\ncertain races are intellectually and morally inferior to the rest of\nthe population. \n\n\nA fourth view is that direct discrimination is wrong because it fails\nto treat individuals based on their merits. Thus, Hook argues that\nhiring decisions based on race, sex, religion and other social\ncategories are wrong because such decisions should be based on who\n\u201cis best qualified for the post\u201d (1995: 146). In a similar\nvein, Goldman argues that discriminatory practices are wrong because\n\u201cthe most competent individuals have prima facie rights to\npositions\u201d (1979: 34).\n\n\nOpponents of this merit-based view note that it is often highly\ncontestable who the \u201cbest qualified\u201d really is, because\nthe criteria determining qualifications are typically vague and do not\ncome with weights attached to them (Wasserman 1998: 807).\nAdditionally, Cavanagh suggests that \u201chiring on merit has more\nto do with efficiency than fairness\u201d (2002: 20). Cavanagh also\nnotes that a merit principle cannot explain what is distinctively\nwrong about an employer who discriminates against blacks because the\nemployer thinks that they are morally or intellectually inferior. The\nmerit approach \u201cmakes [the employer\u2019s] behavior look the\nsame as any other way of treating people \u2026\nnon-meritocratically\u201d (2002: 24\u201325).\n\n\nA fifth view, defended by Arneson and Lippert-Rasmussen, explains the\nwrongfulness of discrimination in terms of a certain consequentialist\nmoral theory.  The theory rests on the principle that every action\nought to maximize overall moral value and incorporates the idea that\nbenefits accruing to persons who are at a lower level of well-being\ncount more toward overall moral value than benefits to those at a\nhigher level.  Additionally, the view holds that benefits to persons\nwho are more deserving of them count more than benefits to those who\nare less deserving (Arneson 1999: 239\u201340 and Lippert-Rasmussen\n2014: 165\u201383).  This approach holds that discrimination is wrong\nbecause it violates a rule that would be part of the social morality\nthat maximizes overall moral value.  Thus, Arneson writes that his\nview \u201ccan possibly defend nondiscrimination and equal\nopportunity norms as part of the best consequentialist public\nmorality\u201d (2013: 99).  However, for many thinkers, the view will\nfail to adequately capture a key aspect of discrimination, viz., that\ndiscrimination is not simply wrong but that it is a wrong to the\npersons who are discriminated against.  One might argue in\ndefense of Arneson that those who are victimized by discrimination can\nclaim that they deserve the opportunity that is denied them, but\nphilosophers like Cavanagh, who object to the merit approach, will\nhave the same objections to such a defense (Cavanagh 2002: 20 and\n24\u201325).\n \n\nA sixth view, developed by Moreau, regards direct discrimination as\nwrong because it violates the equal entitlement each person has to\nfreedom. In particular, she contends that \u201cthe interest that is\ninjured by discrimination is our interest in \u2026\ndeliberative freedoms: that is, freedoms to have our decisions\nabout how to live insulated from the effects of normatively extraneous\nfeatures of us, such as our skin color or gender\u201d (2010:\n147). Normatively extraneous features are \u201ctraits that we\nbelieve persons should not have to factor into their deliberations\n\u2026as costs.\u201d For example,\n\u201cpeople should not be constrained by the social costs of being\none race rather than another when they deliberate about such questions\nas what job to take or where to live\u201d (2010:\n149).\n\n\nYet, it is unclear that Moreau\u2019s account gets to the bottom of\nwhat is wrong with discrimination. One might object, following the\ncriticisms leveled by Wasserstrom and Cavanagh at the arbitrariness\nand merit accounts, respectively, that the idea of a normatively\nextraneous feature is too abstract to capture what makes racial\ndiscrimination a paradigmatic form of direct discrimination.  There\nare reasons that justify our belief \u201cthat persons should not\nhave to factor [race] into their deliberations \u2026as\ncosts,\u201d and those reasons seem to be connected to the idea\nthat racial discrimination treats persons of a certain race as having\na diminished or degraded moral status as compared to individuals\nbelonging to other races. The wrong of racial and other forms of\ndiscrimination seems better illuminated by understanding it in terms\nof such degraded status than in terms of the idea of normatively\nextraneous features.\n\n\nA seventh view, developed by Hellman, holds that \u201cdiscrimination\nis wrong because it is demeaning\u201d (2018: 99). On her account, an\nact that is demeaning in the relevant way is one that \u201cexpresses\nthat a person or group is of lower [moral] status\u201d and is\nperformed by an agent who has \u201csufficient social power for the\nexpression to have force\u201d (2018: 102). For example, it is\ndemeaning, she argues, for an employer to require female employees to\nwear cosmetics because such a requirement \u201cconveys the idea that\na woman\u2019s body is for adornment and enjoyment by others\u201d\n(2008: 42). Shin proposes a similar account in his discussion of equal\nprotection, arguing that \u201cto characterize an action as unequal\ntreatment is to register a certain objection as to what, in view of\nits rationale, the action expresses\u201d (2009: 170). Offending\nactions are ones that treat a person \u201cas though that individual\nbelonged to some class of individuals that was less entitled to right\ntreatment than anyone else\u201d (2009:169).  And this seventh view\nof what makes discrimination wrongful is reflected in the legal\ncase Obergefell v. Hodges, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court\nand declaring unconstitutional laws prohibiting same-sex marriage.  In\nhis opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy wrote that \u201cthe\nnecessary consequence [of such laws] is to put the imprimatur of the\nState itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those\nwhose own liberty is then denied. Under the Constitution, same-sex\ncouples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex\ncouples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their\npersonhood to deny them this right\u201d (2015: Slip Opinion at\n19).\n\n\nClosely related to Hellman\u2019s account is an eighth view, holding\nthat direct discrimination is wrong on account of its connection to\nprejudice, where prejudice is understood as an attitude that regards\nthe members of a salient group, qua members, as not entitled\nto as much respect or concern as the members of other salient\ngroups. Prejudice can involve feelings of hostility, antipathy, or\nindifference, as well as a belief in the inferior morals, intellect,\nor skills of the targeted group. Returning to the case of the Roma who\nwere excluded by the policy of a bar, we could say that the policy was\ndiscriminatory because it was the expression of prejudice against the\nRoma, whereas a bar\u2019s policy of excluding men from the\nwomen\u2019s restroom would fail to be discriminatory because it\nwould not be an expression of prejudice.\n\n\nEly defends a version of this eighth view, holding that discriminatory\nacts are those that are motivated by prejudice (1980:\n153\u2013159). Dworkin has formulated an alternative version, arguing\nthat discriminatory acts are those that could be\njustified only if some prejudiced belief were correct.\nThe absence of a \u201cprejudice-free justification\u201d thus makes\na law or policy discriminatory (1985: 66).\n\nThe eighth view, along with the accounts of Hellman and Shin, rest on\nthe intuitively attractive idea that the wrongfulness of direct\ndiscrimination is tied to its denial of the equal moral status of\npersons.  The idea is at the center of Eidelson\u2019s account, which\nholds that \u201cacts of discrimination are intrinsically wrong when\nand because they manifest a failure to show the discriminatees the\nrespect that is due them as persons\u201d (2015: 7).  Eidelson then\ndisaggregates two dimensions of personhood: all persons are 1)\n\u201cof [intrinsic] value and equally so\u201d and 2)\n\u201cautonomous agents\u201d (2015: 79), shaping their own lives\nthrough their choices.  Discrimination can violate either or both of\nthese dimensions, leading Eidelson to describe his account as a\n\u201cpluralistic view\u201d (2015: 19; cf. Beeghly on \u201chybrid\u201d\ntheories, 2018: 95). Thus, a physician who refuses to treat would-be\npatients due to their race fails to recognize and appropriately\nrespond to their equal intrinsic value, and a fire department that\nautomatically rejects women who apply to be fire fighters violates the\nwomen\u2019s autonomy by failing to make reasonable efforts to\ndetermine whether they have endeavored to develop the requisite\nphysical strength.\n\nEidelson\u2019s account explicitly dispenses with the social salience\nrequirement, instead requiring only that the discriminator be\nresponding to some perceived difference of whatever kind between the\nvictim and other people.  However, it is not clear that this approach\ncan draw a viable line between wrongful acts of discrimination, on the\none hand, and wrongful acts not helpfully characterized as\n\u201cdiscrimination,\u201d on the other. Murderers fail to respect\nthe personhood of their victims, and most murders involve some\nperception of difference between the victim and others. But murders\nare typically regarded as acts of discrimination only when they are\n\u201chate crimes\u201d connected to the victim\u2019s membership\nin some salient social group. So Eidelson\u2019s account seems\noverinclusive. Yet, Eidelson can reply that any account that\nincorporates the social salience requirement will be underinclusive,\nbecause it will fail to count as discrimination the actions of an\nemployer who hires workers on the basis of hair color in a society\nwhere hair color is not socially salient (2018: 28\u201330).\n\nAt this point, we should step back and ask: Why do we need the\n(moralized) idea of discrimination in the first place? What is the\nvalue of having it?  For Eidelson, its value seems to reside in\npicking out certain wrongs, quite apart from any connection those\nwrongs might, or might not, have to socially systemic injustices.  But\nwe have concepts for murder and other wrongs against personhood, and,\nif we abstract from socially systemic considerations, the fact that\nthe wrongs involve distinguishing among persons does not appear to\ncarry much moral significance in typical cases.  If I steal from you\nrather than your neighbor because you have taken fewer precautions\nagainst theft, then I have wrongfully shown disrespect for your\nautonomy, but my having discriminated between you and your neighbor\nseems beside the point, morally speaking. \n\nFor defenders of the social salience requirement, the value of the\nidea of discrimination is that it can be used to pick out and\nhighlight injustices that track socially salient categories.  And a\nstrong reason for having a concept that captures such injustices is\nthat they are the among the most widespread and serious over the\ncourse of history (see section 6 below).  From this perspective,\nEidelson\u2019s hypothetical case of the idiosyncratic employer who\ndiscriminates on the basis of hair color should not dictate how the\ncore of the moralized concept of discrimination is constructed or\nconstrued but rather should be regarded as peripheral to the central\nreason for having a concept of discrimination.  Additionally, as we\nwill see in the next section, this perspective casts light on why the\nidea of indirect discrimination is a valuable part of our moral\nthinking.\n4.2 The Wrongs of Indirect Discrimination\n\n\nThe most egregious forms of indirect discrimination are typically\nstructural, due to the pervasive impact of a society\u2019s basic\ninstitutions on the life-prospects of its members (Rawls 1971:\n7). Indirect discrimination is structural when the rules and norms\nof society consistently produce disproportionately disadvantageous\noutcomes for the members of a certain group, relative to the other groups\nin society, the outcomes are unjust to the members of the disadvantaged\ngroup, and the production of the outcomes is to be explained by the\ngroup membership of those individuals. Cass Sunstein nicely captures the\nwrong of this form of indirect discrimination in the course of\nexplaining his antidiscrimination principle, which he calls the\n\u201canticaste principle.\u201d He writes, \u201cThe\nmotivating idea [for the anticaste principle] is that without good\nreason, social and legal structures should not turn differences that\nare both highly visible and irrelevant from the moral point of view\ninto systematic social disadvantages. A systematic disadvantage is one\nthat operates along standard and predictable lines in multiple and\nimportant spheres of life\u201d (1994: 2429). In a similar vein,\nCatharine MacKinnon finds structural discrimination against women to be\nintolerable because it consists of \u201cthe systematic\nrelegation of an entire group of people to a condition of\ninferiority\u201d (1987: 41).\n\n\nTwo related wrongs belonging to structural discrimination can be\ndistinguished. First is the wrong that consists of society\u2019s major\ninstitutions imposing, without adequate justification, relative\ndisadvantages on persons belonging to certain salient social\ngroups. Accordingly, it is wrong for society\u2019s basic rules to deny to\nwomen or to racial or religious minorities opportunities for personal\nfreedom, development, and flourishing equal to those that men or\nracial and religious majorities enjoy. Second is the wrong of placing\nthe members of a salient social group in a position of vulnerability\nto exploitation and domination as a result of the denial of equal\nopportunities and the imposition of other kinds of relative\ndisadvantage. Accordingly, it is wrong for a society to make women\nvulnerable to sexual exploitation and domination at the hands of men\nby the imposition of various economic and social disadvantages\nrelative to men.\n\n\nIn contrast, the wrongs of non-structural forms of indirect\ndiscrimination seem to be dependent on structural (or direct)\ndiscrimination. Consider the Griggs case. The\ncompany\u2019s promotion policy was not part of the wrong involved in\nsociety\u2019s basic institutions imposing relative disadvantages on\nblacks. But the policy did have some connection to structural\nracial discrimination and to the widespread direct discrimination\nagainst blacks that existed prior to and contemporaneous with the\npolicy. The policy helped to perpetuate the unjust disadvantages\nthat were due to such structural and direct discrimination, even though\nthe policy was not needed to serve any legitimate business purpose, and\nthat was why the policy was wrong. Or at least that is what the\nproponents of the idea of indirect discrimination appear to have in\nmind when they talk about non-structural forms of indirect\ndiscrimination.\n\n\nAre the wrongs of indirect discrimination sufficiently similar to the\nwrongs of direct discrimination that it is reasonable to say that they\nare, in fact, two different types of one and the same wrong? We have\nseen that the accounts of the wrong of direct discrimination are many\nand various. But abstracting from those differences, critics of the\nidea of indirect discrimination might argue that discrimination is\nessentially a process-based wrong, rather than an outcome-based one,\nand that only direct discrimination is process-based. In other words,\nonly with direct discrimination is there a defect in how some outcome\nis brought about, rather than in what the outcome itself is. On this\nview, discriminating against people is similar to having someone who\nhas been bribed serve as a judge in an ice-skating competition: just\nas the biased judging taints the process by which places are awarded\nin the competition, discrimination taints the process by which\nopportunities and other social goods get distributed among the members\nof society.\n\n\nHowever, one can understand indirect discrimination as involving\nprocess-based wrongs, although the wrongs do not necessarily occur at\nthe retail level of the practical reasoning of specific agents.\nConsider the structural form of indirect discrimination.\nDisproportionately disadvantageous outcomes do not, by\nthemselves, amount to structural discrimination, even when those\noutcomes fall on the shoulders of the members of a salient social group\nsuch as women or racial or religious minorities. There must also\nbe a linkage between membership in the group and the disadvantageous\noutcomes: group membership must help explain why the disproportionately\ndisadvantageous outcomes fall where they do. This explanation\nwill proceed at the wholesale level of macro-social facts about the\npopulation and the various groups that constitute it. But the\nrequirement of a linkage shows that how the disproportionate outcomes\nare brought about is essential to the existence of structural\ndiscrimination. There must be social processes at work that, as\nSunstein puts its, \u201cturn differences that are both highly visible\nand irrelevant from the moral point of view into systematic social\ndisadvantages\u201d (1994: 2429). It is true that the\ndifferences do not need to be literally visible; they need only be\nsocially salient. But the main point is that there is something\nmorally wrong with social processes that consistently but avoidably\nturn such differences into relative disadvantages for the members of\nsalient groups, such as women or racial or religious groups. A\nparallel is thereby established with direct discrimination, in which\nthere is something morally wrong with a practical-reasoning process\nthat treats sex, race, or religion as grounds for treating persons as\nhaving a degraded or diminished moral status.\n\n\nWith the non-structural form of indirect discrimination, the parallel\nto the wrong of direct discrimination is even stronger, because the\nmorally flawed process does occur at the retail\nlevel. In Griggs, the company\u2019s decision to use certain\nexams to determine promotions contributed to the unjust disadvantages\nsuffered by blacks from structural and direct discrimination.  Yet,\nthe use of the exams was apparently not necessary to determine who\ncould best perform the jobs in question or to meet any other\nlegitimate purpose of the business. It is plausible to say, then, that\nthe company\u2019s decision process wrongly counted for nothing the\npromotion policy\u2019s contribution to the perpetuation and even\nexacerbation of unjust disadvantages from which blacks already\nsuffered. This process-based wrong is at the level of a specific\nagent, albeit a collective agent. The difference with direct\ndiscrimination is that it is a moral failure of omission, i.e.,\nfailing to take appropriate account of the impact of the promotion\npolicy on blacks, rather than a failure of commission, such as\ndeliberately excluding blacks from better-paying positions. In either\ncase, though, an agent has engaged in a morally flawed process of\npractical reasoning in which the flaw concerns the role that\nconsiderations of salient group membership play. \n\n\nThere is a case to be made, then, that the wrongs of indirect\ndiscrimination, structural and non-structural, are importantly\nparallel to those of direct discrimination. The case will look less\nconvincing to Eidelson (2015: 28\u201330) and others who think of\n(moralized) discrimination as fundamentally a retail-level wrong with\nno necessary connection to socially-salient groups.  For those\nthinkers, it might be an injustice if the basic structure of a society\noperates so that certain socially-salient groups lack equality of\nopportunity, but the injustice is not necessarily a matter of\ndiscrimination.  Yet, for thinkers who would contend that the value of\nthe idea of discrimination derives from the fact that it can pick out\nsystemic wrongs linked in a certain way to socially-salient groups,\nthen direct and indirect discrimination represent distinct but\nparallel versions of the same type of wrong, and the term\n\u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 is not simply \u201ca piece of\nlegal jargon\u201d (Eidelson 2015: 19) but a valuable term in our\nmoral lexicon. \n5. Which Groups Count?\n\n\nAccording to the account on offer in this entry, discrimination\nwrongfully imposes relative disadvantages or deprivations on persons\nbased on their membership in some salient social group. But which\nsalient groups count for the purpose of determining whether an act is\nan act of discrimination? This question is at the heart of many heated\npolitical and legal disputes, such as the controversies over the\nrights of gays and trans persons. The question is also central to a\nmatter that is less politically prominent than such disputes but which\nhas important political and philosophical implications. The question\nis whether or not the members of socially dominant groups can, in\nprinciple, be victims of discrimination. It is sometimes said that, in\nthe United States and other Western countries, whites cannot really be\ndiscriminated against on account of their race, because whites are the\nsocially dominant racial group whose members are systematically\nadvantaged by their being white. Thus, in his account of racial\ndiscrimination, Scanlon acknowledges that his view entails that, in\nthe U.S., at least, whites can discriminate against blacks but not\nvice-versa. He holds that discrimination is \u201cunidirectional,\n[applying] only to actions that disadvantage members of a group that\nhas been subject to widespread denigrations and exclusion.\u201d This\nimplication derives from his claim that it is \u201ccrucial to racial\ndiscrimination \u2026 that the prejudicial judgments it involves are\nnot just the idiosyncratic attitudes of a particular agent but are\nwidely shared in the society in question and commonly expressed and\nacted on in ways that have serious consequences\u201d (2008:\n73\u201374). The idea that discrimination is unidirectional is also\nimplied by Fiss\u2019s understanding of discrimination in terms of\n\u201cthe perpetual subordination\u201d of \u201cspecially\ndisadvantaged groups \u2026[whose] political power is severely\ncircumscribed\u201d (1976: 154\u2013155).\n\nAlthough is it undeniable that the members of socially dominant groups\ntypically enjoy a host of unfair advantages, it might be a mistake to\nhold that such persons cannot be victims of discrimination.  Belief in\nthe moral inferiority of the members of other racial groups is not\nexclusive to dominant groups.  Although he subsequently repudiated the\nview, Malcolm X famously regarded whites as a race of devils, and the\nbelief was not some idiosyncrasy of his but rather a doctrine of the\nNation of Islam.  Moreover, subordinate group members are sometimes in\nposition to deny members of a dominant group employment or other\nvaluable opportunities.  When such opportunities are denied based on a\nbelief in the moral inferiority of the dominant group, it would seem\nthat the dominant group members have been discriminated against.\n\n\nScanlon and others might argue that the unidirectional view fits\nbetter than a bidirectional one with the main reason for having a\nconcept of discrimination, viz., to pick out systemic injustices\nlinked to membership in a socially salient group. The discriminatory\nactions of dominant group members typically combine to create such\ninjustices, while actions of subordinate group members wrongly\ndisfavoring on the basis of prejudiced attitudes persons in the\ndominant group fail to combine in that way.\n\n\nHowever, history shows that there are certain kinds of social\nidentities on whose basis persons have often been condemned as moral\ninferiors and victimized by serious systemic injustice. Those\nidentities are tied to race, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity,\nand sexual orientation, among other social categories incorporated\ninto reasonable antidiscrimination principles.  Wrongs done to persons\nin a dominant group on the ground that their group consists of morally\ninferior beings is not the same as the discriminatory wrongs that\ncombine to create serious systemic injustice, but there is more than a\npassing resemblance between the two sets of wrongs.  And shifts in the\nrelative power positions of groups in a society can readily transmute\nwrongs against a dominant group into ones against a subordinate group,\nespecially when the wrongs are driven by beliefs about groups moral\ninferiority/superiority. Perhaps, then, we should say that the central\ncases of discrimination are ones perpetrated against subordinate group\nmembers but that dominant groups members can also be discriminated\nagainst, even though wrongs of the latter sort do not typically\ncombine to form systemic injustices at the broad social level.\n\nPerhaps the most heated of contemporary debates over the question of\nwhich social groups count for purposes of determining whether or not\nan act is an act of discrimination are those concerning sexual\norientation and gender presentation. Many persons hold the view that\nit is discrimination whenever LGBTQ persons are denied the same set of\nlegal rights and powers that heterosexual and cis-gender persons have,\nbut others reject such a view. Philosophers and political theorists\ncan be found on both sides of this divide, although the predominant\nview among such thinkers is that it is discriminatory to deny\nLGBTQ persons the same legal rights and powers that others enjoy\n(Macedo 1996; Corvino 2017; Mikkola 2018; Brief of Philosophy\nProfessors 2019, and, dissenting, Finnis 1997 and Anderson and Girgis\n2017). These debates are ultimately ones of moral principle, resting\non the question of whether government wrongs LGBTQ persons if it\ndenies them any such rights or powers. The concept of discrimination\ncannot, by itself, settle the question, because the concept only tells\nus that it is properly applied to the imposition of wrongful\ndisadvantages on account of salient group membership. The concept does\nnot specify whether it is wrongful to impose disadvantages on persons\non account of their sexual orientation, gender presentation, or any\nother particular social category. Substantive moral reasoning is\nneeded to address the matter (see section 8 below).\n6. What Good is the Concept of Discrimination?\n\n\nThe concept of discrimination picks out a kind of moral wrong that is\na function of the salient social group membership of the person\nwronged: persons are treated as though they had diminished or degraded\nmoral status on account of their group membership, or they are,\nbecause of their group membership and the relative disadvantages that\nthey suffer due to that membership, made vulnerable to domination and\noppression.  But why have such a concept? Why not simply have the\nconcepts of domination, oppression, and degrading treatment,\nabstracting from whether or not the reasons for such wrongs involve\ngroup membership?\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, critical moral\nreflection and discussion proceeded largely without the concept of\ndiscrimination. But over the course of the first half of the 20th\ncentury, moral reflection became increasingly sensitive to the fact\nthat many, even most, of the large-scale injustices in history had a\ngroup-based structure: certain members of society were identified by\nothers as belonging to a particular salient group; the group members\nwere consistently denigrated and demeaned by the rest of society and\nby its official organs; and many serious relative disadvantages\nconnected to this denigration and demeaning, such as material\ndeprivation and extreme restrictions on liberty, were imposed on the\nmembers of the denigrated group. It is this historical reality,\napparently deeply rooted in human social life and in the tendency of\nhumans to form in-groups and out-groups, that gives the concept of\ndiscrimination its point and its usefulness. The concept highlights\nthe group-structure of those unjust deprivations and\nrestrictions. \n\n\nAt the same time, the group structure of these injustices does not\nmean that the group as such is the party that is wronged;\nrather, the wrongs are ultimately wrongs to the individual persons\nmaking up the group. Accordingly, the concept of discrimination has\nbecome a useful tool for representing many serious wrongs, while\navoiding the implication that these wrongs are ultimately done to the\ngroups as such.\n\n\nHowever, this understanding of the significance of the concept of\ndiscrimination is challenged by Young, who claims that the concept is\ninadequate for capturing group-based wrongs. She argues that the\nconcept \u201ctends to present the injustices groups suffer as\naberrant, the exception rather than the rule.\u201d Accordingly, she\ncontends that \u201c[i]f one focuses on discrimination as the primary\nwrong that groups suffer, then the more profound wrongs of\nexploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism,\nand violence that we still suffer go undiscussed and\nunaddressed.\u201d (1990: 196\u201397)\n\nNonetheless, contra Young\u2019s understanding,\ndiscrimination against the members of a group can be, and often is,\nsystemic. The reason is that wrongs against individuals on account of\ntheir group membership, especially when perpetrated by members of\ndominant groups, are often not aberrant but form broad social\npatterns. Accordingly, the idea of discrimination can capture the\nsystemic wrongs to which Young refers, while preserving the key moral\nthought that the wrongs are done to individuals.  Thus, discrimination\ntypically involves exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness and so\non, where those wrongs are perpetrated against individuals and, at the\nsame time, track salient social categories.\n\n\nYet, Young is right insofar as she is claiming that systemic wrongs\ncan persist even as direct discrimination recedes: indirect\ndiscrimination can, as we have seen, amplify and perpetuate the\nwrongful harms of diminishing direct discrimination.  Additionally,\nYoung correctly suggests that the idea of discrimination is too weak\nto adequately capture certain sorts of extreme systemic maltreatment\nand abuse.  When disadvantageous treatment exceeds a certain level of\nseverity, it is no longer suitable simply to speak of\ndiscrimination. Enslavement and genocide are forms of wrongful\ndiscrimination, but because of the extremity of the mistreatment they\ninvolve, it would be morally obtuse to characterize them as\ndiscrimination and leave the matter at that.  Clear-headed moral\nthinking demands that their extremity be registered in how they are\ncharacterized, and the idea of discrimination is not, by itself,\nequipped for the task.  Accordingly, the invention of the term\n\u2018genocide\u2019 by Raphael Lemkin (1944 [1973: 79]) and the\nopprobrium that later attached to it were important steps forward in\nunderstanding the distinctions among the different ways in which\nhumans abuse one another on the basis of the salient groups to which\nthey belong.\n7. Intersectionality\n\n\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw (1998 [1989]) introduced the idea of\nintersectionality in her account of the distinctive form of\ndiscrimination faced by black women. Intersectionality refers to the\nfact that one and the same person can belong to several distinct\ngroups, each of whose members are victimized by widespread\ndiscrimination. This overlapping membership can generate experiences\nof discrimination that are very different from those of persons who\nbelong to just one, or the other, of the groups.  Thus, Crenshaw\nargues that \u201cany analysis that does not take intersectionality\ninto account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in\nwhich Black women are subordinated\u201d (1998: 315).\n\n\nCrenshaw\u2019s idea of intersectionality applies beyond race and\ngender to cover any social groups against which discrimination is\ndirected: discrimination is inflected in different ways depending\non the particular combination of social groups to which those persons\ndiscriminated against belong. And one implication of\nintersectionality is that the disadvantages suffered by some persons\nwho are discriminated against on account of belonging to a\ncertain group might be offset, partially or fully, by advantages those\nsame persons gain by being discriminated in favor of due to\ntheir belonging to other groups. As Crenshaw notes, women who are\nwealthy and white are \u201crace- and class-privileged,\u201d even as\nthey are disadvantaged by their gender (1998: 314).\n\n\nThe idea of intersectionality threatens to destabilize the concept of\ndiscrimination. The idea highlights what is problematic about any\naccount of discrimination that abstracts from how different salient\nidentities converge to shape the experiences of persons. But, taken to\nthe hilt, the idea of intersectionality might appear to undermine any\nfeasible account of discrimination. Reflection on Crenshaw\u2019s own\nintersectional account illustrates the point: she examines the\nintersection of race and gender but abstracts from other salient\nsocial identities, such as disability status, sexual orientation, and\nreligion. Any of those additional identities can and do converge with\nrace and gender to form distinctive experiences of discrimination, and\nso abstracting from those identities seems problematic from the\nperspective that the idea of intersectionality opens to us. Yet, no\nfeasible treatment can take into account all of those identities and\nthe many more socially salient identities that persons have in\ncontemporary societies.\n\n\nNonetheless, judgments about discrimination can and do reveal genuine\nwrongs that persons suffer due to their salient group membership and\nexpose actual patterns of disadvantage and deprivation that amount to\nsystemic injustices against the members of certain salient\ngroups. It is not necessary to take account of everything\nrelevant to a phenomenon in order to understand and represent important\naspects of it. Thus, notwithstanding the complications introduced\nby intersectionality, judgments about direct and indirect\ndiscrimination can tell us something important about who is wrongfully\ndisfavored, and who is wrongfully favored, by the actions of individual\nand collective agents and by the rules of society\u2019s major\ninstitutions.\n8. Religious Liberty and Antidiscrimination Laws\n\nLike the right against discrimination, the right of religious liberty\nis enshrined in many domestic and international legal documents. Yet,\nthe two rights often seem to be in conflict with each other.  For\nclaims of religious liberty are frequently made by persons who wish to\nengage in activities that appear to amount to discrimination.  Of\nparticular importance are cases in which religious institutions and\nreligiously-motivated individuals claim to be exempt from the\nrequirements of antidiscrimination laws.\n \n\nClaims of religious exemption to antidiscrimination laws have recently\nbecome the center of political and legal controversy in the U.S. as a\nresult of the Obergefell case, in which the Supreme Court\nfound a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.  However, questions\nregarding the legal and moral validity of religious exemptions to such\nlaws extend well beyond the issue of same-sex marriage.  Moreover,\nmany liberal thinkers who support antidiscrimination laws balk at the\nidea that the laws ought to be applied willy-nilly to all religious\ninstitutions and religiously-motivated persons (Barry 2001:\n174\u201376; Eisgruber and Sager 2007: 65; Greenawalt 1998: 118;\nNussbaum 1999: 114; Galston 2002: 111; Laborde 2017: 175\u201390).\n\nIn the Hosanna-Tabor case (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court\nunanimously held that, under the Constitution, there was a\n\u201cministerial exception\u201d immunizing religious organizations\nfrom lawsuits brought against them by employees claiming that they had\nbeen illegally discriminated against by the organization.  The\nexception applies in the paradigmatic case to employees who perform\nreligious functions, such as ministers and priests, but the Court\nin Hosanna-Tabor ruled that the exception also applied in the\ncase of a church employee whose job was the teaching of secular\nsubjects.  The employee had brought her lawsuit under a statute\nprohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of disability.  The\nCourt held that the church was immune to the suit. \n\n\nChambers rejects the ministerial exception, even when it is limited to\nemployees who perform spiritual functions.  Accordingly, she argues\nthat the Roman Catholic Church should be legally prohibited, on the\nground of \u201cthe fundamental value of gender equality\u201d\n(2008: 141), from ordaining only men.  She points to the harms\nsuffered by women who wish to become priests but also the damage done\nto children who are taught by their Church that \u201cwomen are not\nfit to lead their fellow worshippers\u201d (141). And Chambers\ncontends that \u201cgender equality is \u2026 of sufficient importance\nto merit [legal] intervention\u201d (144) in a religious\norganization\u2019s choice of spiritual leaders.\n\nBy contrast, Laborde contends that \u201cthe government cannot\n[legitimately] force the Roman Catholic Church to ordain female\nclergy, as long as the established doctrine of the church is that only\nmen can be priests\u201d (2017: 180).  She argues that, if a certain\ngroup is a voluntary association \u201cthat individuals join to\npursue a conception of the good that is central to their\nidentity,\u201d then the group has a valid claim to \u201csome\nimmunity from the reach of antidiscrimination legislation\u201d\n(174).  Such immunity enables the members \u201cto live with\nintegrity,\u201d i.e., to live in accordance with \u201ctheir deep\ncommitments and beliefs\u201d (174). Laborde adds that any group\nclaiming an exemption from antidiscrimination law can be legitimately\nrequired to openly profess the discriminatory doctrine that is the\nbasis for its claim. \n\nAt the same time, Laborde rejects the scope of the ministerial\nexception as presented in Hosanna-Tabor. She contends that\nthe Court\u2019s ruling grants religious groups \u201can exorbitant\nright\u201d (177) that exceeds their valid moral claim to choose\ntheir own leaders and members.  Contra the ruling, Laborde\ndoes not think that the claim holds against the teachers of secular\nsubjects at church schools or any other employees whose jobs do not\nconsist in religious work.  Laborde agrees with the Court that the\nsecular judiciary should not address theological questions, but she\nrejects the Court\u2019s view that it is beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe judiciary to examine whether a proffered non-discriminatory\ntheological reason for an employment decision is merely a pretext for\nsome hidden discriminatory motive.\n\nWatson and Hartley also reject Chamber\u2019s view that the Catholic\nChurch should be legally forced to ordain women, arguing that her view\ndoes not hold for a pluralist society in which a church that refuses\nto ordain women is \u201cone among many\u201d (2018: 123), and\n\u201cvaried views about sex and gender\u201d (124) are held across\nthe society\u2019s religious institutions. Watson and Hartley write\nthat the doctrine of the male-only priesthood \u201cis not benign\nwhen it comes to the status of women as free and equal citizens, but\nits affect is blunted in the background culture by various other views\n\u201d (124).\n\nClaims for religious exemptions from antidiscrimination laws have also\nbeen made, not just by organizations, but by individuals acting on the\nbasis of their faith.  Watson and Hartley consider a case in which a\nwedding vendor refuses her services to same-sex couples, invoking her\nreligious belief that same-sex relationships are inherently sinful\n(cf. Masterpiece Cakeshop: 2018).  The vendor claims an\nexemption from a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation.  Watson and Hartley argue that such an exemption\nis illegitimate, even if same-sex couples can avail themselves of the\nservices of other vendors in the area.  The vendor\u2019s claim to an\nexemption is a violation of the reciprocal respect that each citizen\nowes their fellow citizens, because the vendor is asking government to\nact in a way that cannot be justified to persons in same-sex\nrelationships as equal citizens.  In the view of Watson and Hartley,\nthe claim to an exemption rests on the premise that same-sex\nrelationships are inherently inferior to heterosexual ones.  They\nargue that such a premise is not admissible as a valid reason for the\npolicies of government, which, as a matter of justice, must justify\nits actions to all its citizens in a way that respects their equality.\nAnd it is not reasonable to think that anyone in a same-sex\nrelationship can accept the premise of inferiority.  More generally,\nWatson and Hartley contend that \u201callowing public discrimination\non the basis of factors such as sexual orientation, sex, or race\ncreates a kind of second-class citizenship\u201d (2018: 117-118),\nwhich violates the demands of justice. \n\nVallier develops an approach that is more accommodating of religious\nexemptions. He writes that exemptions are justified \u201cin a wide\narray of cases,\u201d perhaps including that of \u201cbakers [of\nwedding cakes] who wish to deny service to homosexual couples on\nreligious grounds\u201d (2016: 17).  Vallier explains that the bakers\nhave a reason, from their point of view, to oppose an\nantidiscrimination law that protects same-sex couples. Moreover, the\nreason is both intelligible to any reasonable member of the public,\nand, because the reason is rooted in \u201cprojects and principles\nthat possess great normative weight\u201d (14) for the bakers, it is\nsufficient from their perspective to reject the law as applied to\nthem. On Vallier\u2019s account, the bakers, then, merit an\nexemption, as long as the exemption \u201cdoes not impose significant\ncosts on other parties that require redress\u201d (3). \n\nVallier understands that many people will argue that the exemption\ndoes in fact impose significant harms on same-sex couples denied\nservices afforded heterosexual couples, but he responds to that\nargument by citing \u201cmore traditional liberal views\u201d on\nwhich \u201ca denial of service will not count as harmful because, in\nnearly all of the relevant cases, gay and lesbian couples have dozens\nof affordable alternative venues to purchase wedding cakes\u201d\n(18).  \n\nWatson and Hartley reject the \u201cmore traditional liberal\nviews\u201don the ground that, even if there are alternative venues\nat which same-sex couples can be served, the couples are still treated\nas second-class citizens, because they are denied on grounds of the\nalleged inferiority of their partnership the full range of services\noffered to the public.  Vallier might reply that equal citizenship is\nsecured as long as the couples have alternative venues, but it is not\nclear how convincing such a reply is, given his admission that the\nactions of the bakers \u201ccan stigmatize homosexual couples through\ntheir denial of service\u201d (17). It would seem that the stigma\namounts to a stamp of inferiority, publicly-enacted through\nexclusionary actions and affixed to persons in same-sex partnerships,\nregardless of the availability to them of alternative venues. \n\n\nAt the same time, Vallier might argue that his analysis of the case of\nthe bakers is on all fours with Watson and Hartley\u2019s account of\nthe male-only priesthood case, in which they contend that an exemption\nis legitimate: the effect of the bakers\u2019 views on same-sex\ncouples, he might say, \u201cis blunted in the background culture by\nvarious other views\u201d (Watson and Hartley 2018: 124) and by the\navailability of alternative venues for the couples. \n\n\nHowever, Watson and Hartley would reply that there is an important\ndistinction between a church, which is a \u201cprivate association,\ncomposed of individuals who affirm, roughly, the same doctrine,\u201d\nwhile a bake shop is a \u201cbusiness of public accommodation\u201d\n(125).  Yet, the question arises: If the social effects on gender\ninequality of the Catholic Church\u2019s male-only priesthood can be\nsufficiently blunted by the background culture, why are the parallel\neffects of anti-gay bake shops on the equal citizenship of gays not\nlikewise blunted? \n\n\nIt seems that, for Watson and Hartley, the decisive consideration in\nthe bake shop/wedding vendor cases is not a matter of causal effects\non society but rather of how persons are treated in the public sphere,\nwhere citizens owe one another treatment as free and equal persons.\nWatson and Hartley regard the bake shop and all other commercial\nenterprises that offer goods and services to the general public as\nbelonging to the public sphere, and they contend that the denial of\nservices on grounds of sexual orientation violates what citizens owe\none another in that sphere, because such a denial constitutes treating\ncitizens in same-sex partnerships as inferior to citizens in\nheterosexual ones. \n\n\nVallier\u2019s view requires a different account of what citizens owe\neach other.  The \u201cmore traditional liberal views\u201d to which\nhe refers contend that commercial enterprises should be placed in the\nprivate sphere and that antidiscrimination laws applying to\nprivately-owned businesses are thereby illegitimate (see Epstein 1995\nand the Civil Rights Cases 1883).  But Vallier does not appear to\nembrace that aspect of the traditional liberal views, instead arguing\nthat the disparaging treatment of gays by the bakers is made\npermissible (in part) by the fact that gays can receive service at\nother bake shops.  The underlying premise appears to be that it is not\nreally a duty of citizens to treat one another as equals, even in the\npublic sphere. For if the bakers did have a duty to treat all of their\nfellow citizens, including gays, as equals in that sphere, then the\nbakers could not be relieved of the duty on the ground that there were\nother citizen-bakers who did treat gays as equals. I am not morally\nlicensed to treat you with disrespect if only there are many others\nwho treat you respectfully. So the disagreement between Vallier and\nWatson/Hartley seems to come down to the issue of exactly what duties\ncitizens owe one another, which in turn rests on the large question of\nwhat a society of free and equal citizens would look like.\n9. Conclusion\n\n\nThe concept of discrimination provides a way of thinking about a\ncertain kind of wrong that can be found in virtually every society and\nera. The wrong involves a group-based structure that works in\ncombination with relative deprivations built around the structure. The\ndeprivations are wrongful because they treat persons as having a\ndegraded moral status, but also because the deprivations tend to make\nmembers of the group in question vulnerable to domination and\noppression at the hands of those who occupy positions of relative\nadvantage. It is true that there has been confusion attending the\nconcept of discrimination, and there will long be debates about the\nbest way to understand and apply it. However, the concept has proved\nto be a useful one for representing in thought and combating in action\na kind of wrong that is deeply entrenched in human social\nrelations.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"LegCasDoc\">Legal Cases and Documents</a>", "<a name=\"Ref\">References</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"LegCasDoc\">Legal Cases and Documents</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Abdulaziz et al. v.
