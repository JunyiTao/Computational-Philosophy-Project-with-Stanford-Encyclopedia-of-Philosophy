However, scholars are divided about its place, promise and\nprospects as a metaethical theory. The appeal of constructivism as a\nmetaethical theory is often thought to consist in its promise to offer\na minimalist account of moral objectivity that retains the benefits of\nnonnaturalist realism, while avoiding its epistemological and\nontological costs (Darwall, Gibbard, & Railton 1992; Shafer-Landau\n2003: chapter 4). But this is hardly distinctive of constructivism\njust as such. Naturalist realism, an alternative to constructivism,\nalso promises objectivity without the epistemological and ontological\ncosts of nonnaturalist realism. And the defense of objectivity on\nnon-ontological grounds has also been a preoccupation of antirealism\n(Hare 1952; Gibbard 1990; Wright 1992: 6 ff). A better way to present\nwhat constructivism purports to offer is to say that it claims to be\nthe best candidate for reconciling various tensions among the apparent\nfeatures of normative truths: their objectivity, our knowledge of\nthem, and their practical significance for us, including the authority\nthey have or claim (Scanlon 2014: 91). Constructivists think that\ntraditional metaethical theories cannot account for these features\nbecause they misunderstand the nature of practical reason. Thus, their\nclaim is that to solve metaethical problems about the nature of\nethical judgments and normative truths, one should start with an\naccount of practical reason, that which has been left out by standard\nmetaethics. To this extent, constructivists regard standard metaethics\nas misguided. \n",
