More specifically,\none\u2019s moral status consists in there being certain moral reasons\nor requirements, for one\u2019s own sake, for how one is to be\ntreated. For instance, an animal may be said to have moral status if\nthere is at least some moral reason to avoid its suffering, on account\nof this animal itself and regardless of the consequences for other\nbeings.\n\nAt the most general level, there are two main ways of understanding\nthe moral requirements that moral status, or what others sometimes\ncall \u201cmoral standing\u201d or \u201cmoral\nconsiderability,\u201d entails. On the utilitarian approach (see the\nentry on the\n history of utilitarianism),\n moral considerability (their preferred term) is a matter of a moral\nrequirement to have one\u2019s welfare-related interests (e.g., the\nintensity, duration, etc. of one\u2019s pleasure or pain) factored\ninto the calculus that determines which action brings about the\ngreatest utility, and is thus morally best. On the non-utilitarian\napproach, to have moral status is for there to be reasons to act for\nthe sake of the entity (whether this might be to promote its\nwell-being or to appropriately regard some other aspect of the entity,\nsuch as its autonomy), reasons which are prior to, and may clash with,\nwhat the calculation of the overall best consequences would dictate.\nThe non-utilitarian approach is necessarily coupled with two further\nideas: acting unjustifiably against such reasons as well as failing to\ngive these reasons their proper weight in deliberation is not only\nwrong but wrongs the entity and one owes it to the entity to avoid\nacting in this way. Note that utilitarians could incorporate these two\nideas by claiming that it is owed to entities with moral status to\nproperly incorporate their interests into the utilitarian calculus,\nand that one wrongs an entity when this is not done. But these two\nideas are inessential to the utilitarian approach.\n\nSome non-utilitarian philosophers allow for the possibility that moral\nstatus comes in degrees, and introduce the notion of a highest degree\nof status: full moral status (FMS). After reviewing which entities\nhave been thought to have moral status and what is involved in having\nFMS, as opposed to a lesser degree of moral status, this article will\nsurvey different views of the grounds of moral status, focusing\nespecially on FMS, as well as the justification for treating these as\ngrounds of moral status.\n", "toc": [{"#ForWhicEntiDoesQuesMoraStatAris": "1.

For Which Entities Does the Question of Moral Status Arise?\n\nA variety of applied ethics debates regarding how certain beings\n\u2013 human beings, non-human animals, and even ecosystems \u2013\nshould be treated hinge on theoretical questions about their moral\nstatus and the grounds of that moral status. It is these theoretical\nquestions that are the focus of this entry, but a quick survey of the\napplied ethics debates helpfully allows us to identify which entities\nhave been thought to have moral status.\n\nIt is usually taken for granted that all adult cognitively unimpaired\nhuman beings have FMS. Of course, historically the moral status of\npeople falling into a group perceived as \u201cother,\u201d such as\nforeigners, racial minorities, women, the physically disabled, etc.\nhas been routinely denied. Either they were not seen as having any\nmoral status, or if they were granted some status, it was not FMS.\nHowever, accounting for their status does not pose much of a\ntheoretical challenge (see section 5.1) and nowadays their status is\nrarely explicitly and directly denied on principled moral grounds.\n\nBy contrast, constructing plausible theories that account for the\nmoral status of other human beings \u2013 not only the degree of\ntheir status, but in some cases also whether they have it at all\n\u2013 is more challenging (see section 5). Debates about disability\nrights and the permissibility of eugenics rest in part on theoretical\ndisagreements about the moral status of cognitively impaired humans.\nThese issues include controversies regarding the treatment of\ncognitively disabled infants, such as the past U.S. practice of\nallowing infants with Down syndrome to die. Debates concerning\nabortion, stem cell research (see the entry on the\n ethics of stem cell research),\n and the question of what to do with unused frozen embryos from in\nvitro fertilization also rest on the theoretical question of the moral\nstatus of extremely underdeveloped human beings at various stages of\ndevelopment: zygote, embryo, and fetus (see section 5.2). The moral\nstatus of both underdeveloped and cognitively impaired human beings is\noften taken to be at issue when it comes to the use of\npre-implantation genetic diagnosis and amniocentesis. In addition,\nmedical advances that prolong life, as well as debates about\neuthanasia, have led people to question the moral status of humans\nincapable of consciousness, such as those in a persistent vegetative\nstate and anencephalic babies (born without the higher brain).\n\nHumans are not the only beings about whom we might ask if they have\nmoral status, and if so, to what degree. The\n moral status of animals\n is also of concern. Debates regarding the treatment of livestock\n(e.g., raising calves for veal, burning off the beaks of chickens,\netc.), management of wild animals (e.g., killing wolves to protect\nlivestock, killing deer in response to their overpopulation, etc.),\nand the creation and design of zoos rest, in part, on the moral status\nof domesticated and wild animals. In some cases the ethical question\nof an animal\u2019s treatment arises because of the discovery of\ntheir cognitive sophistication (e.g., dolphins, elephants, and great\napes), which is taken to have a bearing on the theoretical issue of\ntheir moral status.\n\nWe have already noted that, while there are disagreements from one\nculture to another, and even within a single culture, both\nhistorically and at any given time, there is also significant\nagreement, at least among non-philosophers, that all cognitively\nunimpaired human adults have the highest degree of moral status. But,\nin addition, non-philosophers in principle, if not always in practice,\naccept the same view regarding all cognitively unimpaired human\ninfants as well as human infants and adults with mild to severe\ncognitive impairments (as we use the term, \u201csevere cognitive\nimpairment\u201d excludes those incapable of consciousness). That is,\nthey hold that infants and the cognitively impaired, whether their\nimpairment is intellectual or emotional, have not merely higher moral\nstatus than most animals, but also have FMS. We will call this the\ncommonsense view. By contrast, there is no such consensus about the\nmoral status of human fetuses, humans incapable of consciousness, and\neven sophisticated animals like great apes.\n\nNonetheless, providing an adequate theory to account for the FMS of\nunimpaired infants and cognitively impaired human beings (whether\ninfants or adults) without attributing the same status to most animals\nhas proven very difficult. In fact, our survey in section 5 suggests\nthat this challenge has not been fully met by any of the existing\naccounts of the grounds of moral status. Some philosophers have, as a\nresult, questioned or even abandoned this seemingly commonsense view,\nincluding the aspect that holds that all adult cognitively\nunimpaired human beings have FMS (see the end of section\n4).\n\nIt is important to note that questions of moral status \u2013 having\nit at all as well as the degree to which it is had \u2013 arise not\nonly for humans and non-human animals, but also for any living\nbeing/entity (such as a tree), as well as for entire species,\necosystems, and non-living entities, such as mountains or a natural\nlandscape (see the entry on\n environmental ethics).\n\nIn section 5 we will discuss how a range of humans (developed, and in\nvarious stages of underdevelopment, unimpaired and impaired),\nnon-human animals, species, and ecosystems fare with respect to\nvarious accounts of the grounds of moral status.\n2. What Is Full Moral Status (FMS)?\n\nIn this section, we will discuss what having FMS amounts to \u2013 a\nnotion key to many non-utilitarian accounts of moral status. With\nrespect to this highest degree of moral status, the literature is the\nmost developed and detailed. Those with FMS are often called\n\u201cmoral persons.\u201d Standardly, FMS is understood to involve\n(i) a very stringent moral presumption against interfering with the\nbeing in various ways \u2013 destroying the being, experimenting upon\nit, directly causing its suffering, etc. While the strong presumption\nagainst interfering is the main aspect of FMS, some philosophers\ninclude as part of FMS (ii) a strong, but not necessarily stringent,\nreason to aid and (iii) a strong reason to treat fairly. Since there\nis no higher moral status, all beings with FMS are owed the same\nprotections and entitlements. That is, all beings with FMS have equal\nmoral status (see the entry on\n egalitarianism).\n\nNote that while the label \u201cFMS\u201d comes from views that\nallow degrees of moral status, some non-utilitarian philosophers (Kant\n[GMM], Regan 2004) see the same protections as comprising the one and\nonly possible moral status.\n2.1 Stringent Presumption against Interference\n\nAll who employ the concept of FMS agree that, under most\ncircumstances, we are morally prohibited from interfering in various\nways with a being with FMS even for the sake of another valued\ncreature and its interests, or for the sake of any other value, such\nas art, justice, or world peace. For instance, we are prohibited from\nkilling a being with FMS for the sake of saving one or several other\nsuch beings. Some philosophers discuss this stringent presumption\nusing the terminology of duties and\n rights\n and focus mainly on the right not to be killed (e.g., Feinberg 1980,\npp. 98\u2013104).\n\nNote that FMS is not typically considered to preclude paternalistic\ninterference. A seven-year-old human being is typically granted FMS\n(as we will see below) but it is nevertheless permissible to treat her\npaternalistically in some respects (see the entry on\n paternalism).\n\nThe stringent moral presumption against interfering with a being with\nFMS, as it is typically understood, has at least these features:\n\nIt is an extremely strong moral reason against interfering,\nregardless of whether this interference results in harm. This\nextremely strong reason can be overridden only in a narrow set of\nspecial circumstances and might altogether silence many types of\nconflicting reasons. For example, while pleasure is a legitimate\nreason for action in numerous circumstances (e.g., when choosing a\nleisure activity), the fact that someone might receive pleasure from\nkilling a being with FMS is altogether removed from consideration as a\nreason for this action.\nDespite its strength, the presumption not to interfere with beings\nwith FMS may be overridden, perhaps, for example, when the lives of a\nvery large number of others are at stake. But, crucially, even when\nthe presumption is legitimately overridden in such special\ncircumstances a moral residue remains, so that, for example, there is\nstill reason to strongly regret the circumstances that called for such\naction.\nThe reason not to interfere with beings with FMS is stronger than\nthe reason not to similarly interfere with beings that have some, but\nnot full, moral status. For example, the reason not to kill a being\nwith FMS in medical experiments is much stronger than the reason (if\nthere is one) not to kill a similarly situated rabbit, which some\nconsider to have lesser moral status. (See section 3 below for further\ndiscussion.)\n\n\nAs noted earlier, those with FMS have equal moral status. This entails\nthat when two beings both have FMS, the reason not to interfere with\nthem is equally strong, all relevant factors held equal, and so one\nequally wrongs them when acting against these reasons, all relevant\nfactors held equal. This idea has been dubbed the \u201cequal\nwrongness thesis\u201d and it is open to various interpretations.\nMcMahan (2002, p. 235) focuses on the equal wrongness of killing\n(rather than the more general idea of the equal wrongness of acting\nagainst all the stringent protections that two beings with FMS merit).\nAccording to McMahan, a variety of factors are thought not to affect\nthe wrongness of killing of beings with FMS (and hence it does not\nmatter whether they are held equal), in cases when killing is wrong:\nthe being\u2019s age, level of intelligence, temperament, social\ncircumstances, etc. For example, for a young and an old person who\nboth have FMS, the reasons not to kill them are claimed to be equally\nstrong despite the fact that the young person stands to lose much more\nin dying than the old. This is consistent with holding (1) that other\nfactors, unrelated to the level of harm to the being, such as the mode\nof agency, defeaters, the number of people affected, and special\nrelationships, do make a difference to the degree of wrongness of\nkilling; and (2) that when killing is not wrong, as well as in the\ncontext of saving, factors related to harm (e.g., age, etc.) do make a\ndifference to what\u2019s best to do (McMahan 2002, pp. 236\u20137).\nMcMahan (2008) acknowledges that there are many challenges to the\nequal wrongness thesis. While the equal moral status of beings with\nFMS entails the equal wrongness of killing such beings when all\nrelevant factors are held equal, one can disagree about how best to\ninterpret it, i.e., which factors are or are not relevant to the\ndegree of wrongness of killing beings with FMS.\n2.2 Strong Reason to Aid\n\nWhile this is less commonly associated with FMS, some philosophers\nbelieve that there is a strong reason to provide aid to beings with\nFMS (e.g., Jaworska 2007 and Quinn 1984). This reason is not as strong\nas the stringent presumption discussed above. For example, the set of\ncircumstances which can override the reason to aid a being with FMS is\nmuch broader compared to the stringent presumption against killing.\nAlso, the reason not to aid might not silence many (or any) other\nconflicting considerations. As for which reasons override or are on a\npar with this strong reason to aid, there are many differing accounts\n(e.g., Greenspan 2010 and the entry on\n moral reasoning,\n section 2.5).\n\nThe strength of this reason to aid can also be understood in\ncomparison with the reason to aid beings with lesser moral status,\nsince beings with FMS merit the strongest reason to aid (see McMahan\n2002, pp. 223\u2013224, for a contrary interpretation of ordinary\nmoral intuitions). Imagine a context in which one is saving\nindividuals from a certain level of harm, such as pain, discomfort, or\ndeath. When faced with a choice of saving either a being with FMS or\none without FMS, barring further reasons that may complicate the moral\npicture (e.g., indirect consequences of saving the being without FMS\nfor other beings with FMS), there is a stronger reason to pick the\nbeing with FMS. Further, even in cases where aiding is not in fact\npossible or the reason to aid is overridden, it is a graver moral\nmisfortune, ceteris paribus, to leave a being with FMS\nunaided, as compared to a being without FMS. Of course, what aid is\nappropriate for a being depends on the context and on the\nbeing\u2019s stage of development. FMS is about the strength of the\nreason to aid and not about what type of aid to give.\n\nNote that even if FMS entails strong reasons to aid, the reverse is\nnot necessarily the case. Stronger reason to aid one being rather than\nanother does not necessarily entail that the aided being has a higher\nmoral status. See more general methodological cautions along these\nlines in section 2.4.\n2.3 Strong Reason to Treat Fairly\n\nWhile this is even less commonly explicitly associated with FMS, some\nviews emphasize that comparable interests of beings with FMS matter\nequally in moral decisions, giving rise to strong reasons to treat\nsuch beings fairly (Broome 1990\u20131991 and Jaworska 2007). For\nexample, when distrib\u00aduting goods among such beings, in\ncircumstances when they can all benefit similarly, barring special\npurposes, relationships, or independent claims on the goods, we have\nstrong reason to distribute the goods equally (or in another way\nthat\u2019s fair, depending on the account of fairness). In some\ncases one will be distributing goods that meet needs and in other\ncases the goods being distributed are not needed, but will\nnevertheless be useful or appreciated. In either case, there is a\nstrong reason to distribute the goods fairly among beings with FMS.\nThis reason does not necessarily apply to beings that lack FMS; for\nexample, a farmer need not worry about being fair in distributing food\nto his cows and chickens.\n2.4 Distinguishing Reasons Constitutive of Moral Status from Other Reasons\n\nIt is helpful to bring out two points about FMS, the second of which\nis not discussed in the literature, but both of which, once made\nexplicit, would likely be accepted by those who work on FMS.\n\nFirst, the reasons mentioned in sections 2.1\u20132.3 ought to be\nunderstood as independent of special relationships, contracts, and\njoint commitments. They are impartial reasons, that is, every moral\nagent (human, intelligent Martian, etc.) has reason to act or forbear\nacting in the ways thus far discussed (McMahan 2005). So, for\ninstance, a parent has at least two reasons not to kill his own child:\na reason in virtue of the child\u2019s FMS, and a reason in virtue of\nthe parental relationship, which generates a special obligation for\nthis particular agent not to kill this particular child. In addition,\nthese reasons are independent of other facts about the action, for\nexample, the action\u2019s possible bad long-term effects. Instead,\nthey are reasons to treat the being this way for the being\u2019s own\nsake.\n\nSecond, it is important, methodologically speaking, not to infer moral\nstatus (full or otherwise) simply from the degree of wrongness or\nbadness of an act, from the existence of rights, or from the strength\nof reasons in favor of the act (including omissions). For example, it\nmight be worse for a parent to kill his own child than a\nstranger\u2019s child, but that does not mean that the children have\ndifferent moral status. The child has a right that her parent not kill\nher, in virtue of the special relationships between parents and their\nchildren, but this is in addition to, and separate from, the right not\nto be killed that the child has in virtue of her moral status. Or, to\ntake another example, there may be a large difference in the strength\nof reasons to save each of two beings from death, but this difference\nmay have little to do with the moral status of the beings. Both\nMcMahan (2002) and Singer (1993) hold, on quite different grounds,\nthat death is not very bad for most animals, while it is very bad for\nordinary adult human beings. Accordingly, on their views, the reason\nto save an ordinary adult human being from death is much stronger than\nthe reason to save, say, a rabbit from death. But this is not itself\nevidence of a higher moral status of the human being. The vast\ndifference in the benefits of aid in the two cases could, on its\nown, lead to a difference in the strength of reasons, which would\nbe fully compatible with the claim that the human and the rabbit have\nthe same moral status. (Of course, one can hold, on other grounds,\nthat they in fact have different status, as McMahan himself does.)\n\nCertain views might acknowledge that some humans lack FMS and yet\nemphasize that we ought, nevertheless, to treat them as though they\nhave FMS due to the bad effects that would otherwise follow. One bad\neffect would be the mistreatment of those who really do have FMS. For\nexample, someone might think that, for practical purposes, we need a\nvery straightforward, stable, and difficult to misinterpret criterion\nof moral status (such as treating being human as a sufficient\ncondition for FMS). If we don\u2019t treat all human beings as if\nthey have FMS, unclarity and moral confusion would ensue. It would\nopen the floodgates for different people to set the threshold capacity\nrequired for FMS differently, and thereby lead to mistaken\nunderinclusion and consequent mistreatment of vulnerable humans (such\nas drug convicts) who do in fact have FMS. Kant\u2019s remarks about\nthe treatment of animals can be interpreted along these lines. He\nargued that we have reasons to avoid cruelty to animals, and thus to\ntreat animals better than their (lack of) moral status implies, since\notherwise we might develop psychological propensities that could lead\nus analogously to mistreat humans who have FMS (Kant [LE], pp.\n212\u201313). Similarly, one might think that if we do not treat\nthose humans without FMS as having FMS, we might develop psychological\npropensities that could lead us to mistreat humans who have FMS.\nAnother bad consequence that can arise, at least were we to fail to\ntreat neonates as having FMS by permitting infanticide, is depriving\nwould-be adoptive parents of the opportunity to adopt (Warren 1996,\nPostscript).\n\nThere are also more self-interested possible bad consequences to\nconsider. Failure to treat infants as having FMS might lead to a lack\nof tenderness toward them, and thereby contribute to their turning\ninto people who will mistreat us when they are older (Feinberg 1980,\np. 198). Moreover, a rule of treating cognitively impaired human\nbeings as having FMS would ensure that we will be treated well should\nwe ever suffer from cognitive impairment (considered without\nendorsement by McMahan 2002, pp. 227\u20138).\n\nRegardless of the details, on all such proposals, the requirement of\ntreating a being as if it had FMS, or some other degree of moral\nstatus, to avoid bad consequences is not equivalent to that\nbeing\u2019s having this moral status: while the reasons adduced\nmight indeed be good reasons to treat the being as if it had the\nrequisite moral status, these reasons are not for the sake of that\nbeing, but rather for the sake of other beings.\n\nOther types of reasons for treating beings as if they had a certain\ndegree of moral status have also been offered. Some virtue ethicists\nclaim that we ought to avoid harming animals because harming them is\nincompatible with displaying the virtuous character traits we ought to\ndisplay (see the entry on the\n moral status of animals\n for details). Several contractualists (see section 6 below and the\nentry on\n contractualism)\n have argued that one may reasonably opt out of any agreement that\ndoes not afford sufficient moral status to one\u2019s children and\nothers one cares about, including those who are severely cognitively\nimpaired (Morris 2011, pp. 265\u2013267 and Carruthers 2011, pp.\n387\u2013394). Critics and proponents disagree whether these\nconsiderations can establish reasons (e.g., reasons not to interfere)\nthat are for these beings\u2019 sake; hence, it is unclear whether\nthey can establish the moral status of the beings in question.\n3. Degrees of Moral Status\n\nThose who accept that moral status comes in degrees have not developed\nfine-grained accounts of what each degree of status would involve.\nTheir emphasis has been on the difference in status between creatures\nor entities that have some moral status (dogs, rabbits, etc.), and\nthose who deserve the highest degree of moral status (FMS). However,\nwith the above account of FMS made explicit, one can delineate\ndifferent paradigms for capturing degrees of moral status, which we\nwill list here simply in the spirit of marking out possible positions,\nand thus without addressing the pros, cons, and implications of each\nposition.\n\nOne way to capture degrees of moral status is to vary the strength of\nthe reasons outlined in section 2 (and hence also the degree of\nwrongness involved in acting against these reasons \u2013 see\nDeGrazia 2008). For example, while there is a very stringent moral\npresumption against killing an unimpaired adult human being, there\nmight be only strong but non-stringent reasons not to kill a dog, and\nvery weak reasons not to kill a fish. The weaker the reason not to\nkill is, the broader the set of circumstances are that can override\nthis reason. In addition, it will silence fewer, if any, conflicting\nconsiderations. The other categories of reasons would be handled\nsimilarly: when the benefit to be received, the cost of providing that\nbenefit, and other similar factors are on a par, there is a strong\nreason to aid an unimpaired adult human being, but only some reason to\naid a dog, and very little reason to aid a fish, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, one could treat FMS as involving a stringent reason not\nto be killed of the type that, in cases of conflict, would override\nwhat maximizes the overall good, whereas, for a being with lesser\nmoral status, what maximizes the overall good \u2013 with this\nbeing\u2019s good included in the calculus \u2013 does settle how\nthis being should be treated (McMahan 2002, pp. 245\u2013247).\n\nAnother way to capture degrees of moral status is to vary not the\nstrength of the reasons but which reasons apply. Instead of the three\ncategories of reasons discussed above, lesser moral status might\ninvolve two kinds of reasons (a stringent moral presumption against\ninterference and a strong reason to aid, but no reason to treat\nfairly) or only one (a stringent moral presumption against\ninterference, but no reason to aid or treat fairly). This, of course,\nis compatible with other reasons, in a given context, to aid or treat\nfairly that do not derive from the being\u2019s moral status (see\nsection 2.4).\n\nAlternatively, lesser moral status might involve fewer presumptions\nagainst different types of interference. For example, there might be\nonly a presumption against causing a chicken pain but not a\npresumption against killing it.\n\nOf course, one could combine these approaches. For example, to have\nthe highest degree of moral status is for there to be very strong\nreasons of all three types, an intermediate level of moral status\n(e.g., the status of a dog) might involve some reason not to kill the\nbeing but no reason to aid it or treat it fairly, while the lowest\ndegree of moral status would involve a very weak reason of just one\ntype. Although having the lowest degree of moral status would not\nafford much protection, it nevertheless is different from having no\nmoral status at all. A fingernail has no moral status and so no\nreasons of any kind need be given for cutting it up and discarding it.\nBut sufficient justification must be provided for doing this to a\nbeing with even very low moral status.\n4. Scalar versus Threshold Conceptions of Moral Status\n\nOne could hold either a threshold or scalar conception of moral\nstatus, although FMS is a threshold conception. Suppose, for example,\nthat the capacity to value (which we will use as shorthand for the\ncapacity to make an evaluative judgment) were a sufficient ground for\nhaving a high degree of moral status. According to the threshold\nconception, if the capacity to value grounds a high degree of moral\nstatus, then any being that has this capacity, regardless of how often\nor how well it can exhibit this capacity, has the same moral status as\nany other being with this capacity. A being that could recognize only\none value among many, and could only value it on rare occasions, would\nhave the same moral status as a being that could recognize many\nvaluable things and value them on every relevant occasion. If the\ncapacity to value is not only sufficient but necessary for a high\ndegree of moral status, then all beings lacking this capacity would\nnot have this high degree of moral status. However, the threshold\nconception would nevertheless leave it open whether having some other\nfeature, such as the mere capacity to have preferences, might be\ngrounds for a lesser degree of moral status. (Having preferences is\ndifferent from making an evaluative judgment; only the latter involves\nthinking of something as good, worthy, and requiring defense [Watson\n1975]. As Watson notes, the strength of one\u2019s preference\nneedn\u2019t at all reflect that one values it or the degree to which\none values it.)\n\nThe threshold conception is not tied to any particular account of the\ngrounds for moral status. Different grounds, discussed in section 5,\nmight involve membership in a group, the capacity for sentience, and\nso on. To put the threshold conception more broadly, so as to cover\nany ground for moral status, and any degree of moral status, whether\nhigh or low, one could state it thus: for any X that is a sufficient\nground for having n-degree of moral status, this status is not altered\nby factors such as how much of X a being has, how well it displays X,\nor the number of other features sufficient for n or lower degrees of\nmoral status the being possesses. The threshold conception leaves it\nopen whether having some other feature (e.g., parts of X or something\nlesser but akin to X) might be grounds for a lesser degree of moral\nstatus and whether yet other features (e.g., more complex capacities)\nmight be grounds for higher degrees of moral status. FMS is a central\nexample of this approach: all beings that meet the threshold\nqualifications for FMS have the same status and this status is\nfull.\n\nIn contrast, the scalar conception highlights the importance of, for\nexample, how often and how well one can exhibit or exercise a capacity\nto value. Put alternatively, if the possession of a generic capacity\nto value makes a difference to moral status, then the possession of\ndifferent specific levels of this capacity (e.g., being able to value\na greater number valuable things or to value them more fully) confers\ndifferential status. As Arneson (1999) would put it, a higher degree\nof the capacity entails a higher status. And so, two beings with the\nsame (generic) capacity might not have equal moral status; only two\nbeings with the same (specific) capacity level would have equal moral\nstatus. Arneson also thinks that if two beings have the specific\ncapacity, but only one of them ever exercises it, then that being will\nhave a higher moral status.\n\nKeep in mind that, as with the threshold conception, the scalar\nconception of moral status is not tied to any particular account of\nwhat grounds moral status \u2013 it applies to any X that is proposed\nto ground moral status. Moreover, a scalar conception might not only\npay attention to (i) how much of X a being has or displays, as\ndescribed in the case above with the capacity to value. It also might\nattend to (ii) how many morally relevant features a being has. One\nversion of (ii) focuses on features that on their own give rise to the\nsame degree of moral status (Arneson [1999] alludes to such a view).\nSuppose, for example, that the capacity to value and being a member of\nthe human species each on their own grounded n-degree of moral status.\nA scalar approach might hold that if a being has both these features,\nit has a higher moral status than a being that has only one. Another\nversion of (ii) would allow for cases like this: suppose the capacity\nfor preferences grounds a certain degree of moral status, while the\ncapacity for consciousness grounds a lesser moral status. Yet, someone\nof a scalar frame of mind might think that the two together give a\nslightly higher degree of status than the capacity for preferences\nalone.\n\nLastly, the scalar conception might consider that a being\u2019s\nmoral status might be greater, not because it has additional less\nsophisticated morally relevant features, as in the previous example,\nbut (iii) because the being has additional more advanced morally\nrelevant features. (iii) works this way. Suppose the capacity to\nemploy means-ends reasoning combined with being a member of the human\nspecies grounded n-degree status. The capacity to value is more\nsophisticated than the capacity to employ means-ends reasoning. Then,\naccording to (iii), a human being with the capacity to value has an\neven higher moral status.\n\nWhile both threshold and scalar conceptions of moral status allow for\ndegrees of moral status, each faces its own set of difficulties. For\nexample, it is not enough for those who hold the threshold view to\nstipulate that, for example, the capacity to do an activity well does\nnot affect one\u2019s status. Once the importance of some feature,\nsuch as the capacity to value, is highlighted, it seems that not only\nthe possession of the capacity but also how well one can exercise it\nis morally relevant to one\u2019s status. This is especially\ncompelling when we compare, for example, an ordinary human\nadult\u2019s capacity to set many ends (i.e, to value and pursue many\nobjects and states of affairs) with the capacity of an impoverished\nbeing who, in its lifetime, \u201ccan set just a few ends and make\njust a few choices based on considering two or three simple\nalternatives\u201d (Arneson 1999, pp. 119\u2013120). The problems is\nessentially the same regardless of whether the capacity is actual,\npotential, or incompletely realized (e.g., when we compare an\nunimpaired baby\u2019s potential \u2013 ability to have an ability\n\u2013 to set many ends with an impaired baby whose potential is far\nmore limited).\n\nAnalogous problems also arise for accounts on which the status\nconferring feature is species membership or being in a special\nrelationship. Possession of the features that qualify one for species\nmembership may be incomplete and a matter of degree (consider Turner\nSyndrome where one is missing or partially missing the X chromosome)\nand relationships can be stronger or weaker. The strength of a\nrelationship might depend, for example, on how robustly one\ninstantiates the features defining the relationship (e.g., how\nrobustly one qualifies as a member of a community) or on how well one\nactively relates (e.g., a child is a more active participant in a\nrelationship than a fetus).\n\nFurthermore, on views that allow for multiple threshold qualifications\nfor the same degree of status (e.g., the capacity to value and being a\nmember of the human species), whether an individual meets only one or\nboth qualifications seems morally relevant to the degree of their\nstatus. Also, some individuals possess features more advanced than the\nthreshold qualification. Threshold views need to provide an\nexplanation for why such differences do not matter.\n\nAdditionally, the threshold conception allows for the possibility of\ndiscontinuities in degrees of moral status that might seem arbitrary.\nThe difference, for example, between a being with a capacity, but who\ncan only exercise it very poorly (e.g., a being that can recognize\nonly one value among many and can only recognize this value on very\nrare occasions), and a being without this capacity (who cannot value\nbut can only form preferences) might not seem to be very great. And\nyet, if the capacity to value grounds FMS, then the former being will\nhave FMS while the latter will have considerably lesser or perhaps no\nmoral status. The advocate of the threshold view could respond that if\nthis capacity is important, then a being with a capacity to do it\npoorly has achieved something important compared to a being without\nthis capacity. In addition, if there are multiple grounds for lesser\ndegrees of moral status (e.g., the capacity to feel pain, the capacity\nto have preferences, the capacity to feel emotions, etc.), which\nthreshold views could allow, then this might remove any large gap in\nstatus between beings with that capacity and those who lack it but who\nhave other capacities conferring only somewhat lesser status. See\nMcMahan (2008) for related discussion.\n\nScalar conceptions, on the other hand, can easily account for\ncontinuous lesser degrees of moral status, but may defy commonsense\nintuitions. For example, if intelligence grounded FMS, then the scalar\nconception would claim that those who are more intelligent have a\nstronger right not to be killed than those who are not quite as\nintelligent. But this is highly at odds with the commonsense intuition\nthat all such beings have an equally strong right not to be killed\n(see Wikler 2009 for a discussion of whether degrees of intelligence\nare relevant to civil rights). Distinguishing and elevating the moral\nstatus of cognitively unimpaired adult humans compared to other\nanimals thus comes at the price of denying that all cognitively\nunimpaired adult humans have equal moral status.\n5. Grounds of Moral Status\n\nAccounts differ on what it is about the individual that grounds or\nconfers moral status and to what degree. This section will focus\nprimarily on the grounds of FMS. We begin with the Sophisticated\nCognitive Capacities accounts and their main strengths and\nshortcomings, especially when it comes to capturing the\n\u201ccommonsense view\u201d discussed in section 1. We then show\nthat alternative accounts also face troubles. So, the challenge\nremains to provide a plausible unified account of the grounds of FMS,\nespecially for those who wish to defend the commonsense view. The\norder of presentation is, roughly, dialectical, not historical.\n5.1 Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n\nAccording to this type of account, a being has FMS if and only if the\nbeing has very sophisticated cognitive capacities. These capacities\nmight be intellectual or emotional. Historically, the most famous\nsophisticated intellectual capacities account was given by Kant,\naccording to whom autonomy, the capacity to set ends via practical\nreasoning, must be respected (see the entry on\n respect)\n and grounds the dignity of all rational beings ([GMM], pp. 434, 436,\nPrussian Academy pagination). Beings without autonomy may be treated\nas a mere means (p. 428). For a contemporary version, see Quinn (1984,\npp. 49\u201352) who claims that the capacity to will (his term for\nautonomy) is sufficient for rights of respect. Other intellectual\ncapacities that have been suggested, even if not always embraced, as\ngrounding what we call FMS include the following: the capacity for\nself-awareness (McMahan 2002, pp. 45 and 242) or awareness of oneself\nas a continuing subject of mental states (Tooley 1972, p. 44); being\nfuture-oriented in one\u2019s desires and plans (one could draw on\nSinger 1993, pp. 95 and 100, though insofar as his own view is\nutilitarian it does not fall into section 5.1); capacity to value, or,\nmore specifically, \u201cto appreciate the value of valuable\nthings\u201d (Buss 2012, p. 352); \u201cbeing good for ourselves in\nvirtue of the capacity to value\u201d (Theunissen 2020, pp.\n126\u2013127); capacity to bargain, and to assume duties and\nresponsibilities (all part of a longer list in Feinberg 1980, p. 197).\nOn the emotional side, one sophisticated capacity that has been\nproposed is the capacity to care, as distinguished from the mere\ncapacity to desire. (Jaworska (2007) posits this as sufficient but\nperhaps not necessary for FMS.) There are also combination views that\nappeal to both intellectual and emotional sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities as necessary and sufficient for FMS (Feinberg 1980, p.\n197).\n\nAccording to Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities accounts, the feature\ngrounding FMS is not relational: the source of moral status is neither\na relation the individual stands in (e.g., membership in a species)\nnor a capacity whose exercise requires active participation of another\n(e.g., the capacity to relate to others in certain mutually responsive\nways). In some versions, the exercise of the relevant capacities does\nnot even require the existence of anyone else, while in others (as in\nthe case of caring about someone) it, at most, involves the presence\nof another being but not necessarily that being\u2019s active\nparticipation. Individuals have FMS solely because they can engage in\ncertain cognitively sophisticated acts or responses on their own.\n\nA being of any type that has these sophisticated cognitive capacities\nhas FMS, and so the accounts avoid anthropocentrism. However, since\nmost (but not necessarily all) animals lack sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities, they are not accorded the same moral status as an\nunimpaired adult human. Similarly, in the case of a living organism\nsuch as a redwood tree or a fetus, as well as non-individual entities,\nsuch as species and ecosystems, they would not have FMS on these\nviews.\n\nSome of these views (e.g., Kant\u2019s) do not allow for any moral\nstatus other than FMS, and so would hold that beings who don\u2019t\nmeet the threshold for FMS have no moral status at all. Other views\nare silent on this question and compatible with lower degrees of moral\nstatus for beings or entities that are not cognitively sophisticated.\nYet others (e.g., McMahan 2002) explicitly insist that all sentient\nbeings have some degree of moral status.\n\nA stock objection to Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities accounts is\ntheir underinclusiveness. Not only will some environmentalists and\nanimal activists find the view underinclusive, but so too will those\nwho subscribe to the \u201ccommonsense view\u201d articulated in\nsection 1. For example, infants lack sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities, and so fail to meet this necessary condition for FMS. The\nversions that offer only a sufficient condition for FMS seem more\nplausible since they leave open alternative routes to FMS. But such\naccounts still leave the moral status of infants unaccounted for, and\npossibly on a par with that of dogs and rabbits. Of course, these\nviews nevertheless allow that there are very strong reasons not to\nkill human infants: it would be disrespectful and harmful to the\ninfant\u2019s parents, it would likely cause psychological harm to\nthe killers, etc. But these reasons, as explained in section 2.4, have\nnothing to do with the moral status of infants, since they are not\nreasons for the infants\u2019 own sake (Feinberg 1980, p. 198 and\nMcMahan 2002, p. 232).\n5.2 Capacity to Develop Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n\nThe problem, at least from the standpoint of the commonsense view, of\n5.1\u2019s underinclusion of infants can be avoided while still\nretaining a shared source of FMS. The accounts can be modified as\nfollows: sophisticated cognitive capacities or the capacity\nto develop these sophisticated capacities (without losing one\u2019s\nidentity) are necessary and sufficient for FMS. This is usually\nlabeled the \u201cpotential\u201d account in the literature (e.g.,\nStone 1987), although some authors do not use this terminology, but\nrather speak, for example, of the wrongness of killing due to the loss\nof a \u201cfuture like ours\u201d (Marquis 1989 and 1995). One can\nalso treat potentiality as a ground for some, but not full, moral\nstatus (Harman 1999, notwithstanding the revisions in Harman 2003) or\nas only an enhancer of moral status (Steinbock 1992, p. 68). Views\ndiffer in their interpretation of potentiality. For example, some deny\nthat a fetus that will die while still a fetus (of any cause) has the\nrelevant potential (Harman 1999, p. 311).\n\nThese potentiality accounts, like the accounts in 5.1, avoid\nanthropocentrism without according most animals the same elevation in\nmoral status. But, unlike the accounts in 5.1, they also include very\nunderdeveloped human beings: not only infants and one-year-olds, but\neven early fetuses have the capacity to develop sophisticated\ncognitive capacities (barring unusual cases). (Of course, these\naccounts are of no help to those interested in according moral status\nto non-human animals, trees, species, and ecosystems.)\n\nAlthough Boonin (2003) denies that his view is a potentiality account\n(p. 62), his view does implicitly appeal to potentiality, albeit with\nsomewhat different implications than those above. He defends having\nthe conjunction of \u201ca future-like-ours\u201d (a kind of\npotentiality) and \u201cactual conscious desires that can be\nsatisfied only if [one\u2019s] personal future is preserved\u201d as\nsufficient for FMS (p. 84). Barring early death, most two-year-olds\nand older children meet both conditions: they have a future like ours\nwhile also having conscious desires (e.g., for avocado tomorrow),\nwhich can only be satisfied if the child lives until the next day.\nEarly fetuses also typically have a future like ours, but they lack\nmental states such as desires, and thus are excluded from FMS. Boonin\nis explicitly neutral on the question whether animals have a\nfuture-like-ours, so his proposal is compatible with several different\nviews about the moral status of animals (p. 84, note 36).\n\nAny attempt to ground moral status in potentiality introduces its own\nchallenges. One could argue that mere potential cognitive capacity is\ninsufficient for FMS or even a weaker moral status. A potential US\npresident has neither rights nor even a claim to command the military;\nlikewise in the case of potentially cognitively sophisticated beings\nand the rights associated with moral status (Feinberg 1980, p.193).\nWhile this particular analogy has been contested (Wilkins 1993, pp.\n126\u2013127 and Boonin 2003, pp. 46\u201349), one can appeal to\nother analogies: a small child (a potential adult) doesn\u2019t have\nthe rights of adults to own property or to watch any television\nprogram it wants (Boonin 2003, p. 48).\n\nStill, there is room to press back on some aspects of this objection.\nWe do, after all, often treat people with potential differently from\nthose without it. We provide extra music instruction, music\nscholarships, and create music camps for those with the potential to\nbecome great musicians, whereas we do not do so for those lacking such\npotentiality. While being a potential adult human does not give one a\nright to vote, perhaps it gives us reason to act as trustees with\nregard to childrens\u2019 future status and interests and thus to\neducate and prepare them to become voters by the time they are adults;\nit does seem that children would be wronged if we neglected to so\nprepare them. In this way, we treat children differently from dogs who\nlack the potential to become adult humans, even though neither is now\nan adult human. And perhaps this difference in treatment would extend\neven to not taking certain actions (e.g., killing) that would result\nin the loss of the relevant potentiality. But this line of response\nmight only go so far when it comes to fetuses. With respect to a\nfuture-like-ours, some argue that the loss of this potentiality is\nmorally problematic only if the being is sufficiently psychologically\nconnected to that future person, and a fetus arguably lacks this\nsufficient connection (McInerney 1990).\n\nEven though the potentiality accounts come closer to capturing the\ncommonsense view than the Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities accounts,\nthey still are, from that point of view, underinclusive. Many\nconscious human beings whose cognitive impairment is both severe and\npermanent cannot meet these accounts\u2019 conditions for an elevated\nmoral status. It might be that humans who currently suffer from\nsevere, permanent cognitive impairment, but once had sophisticated\ncognitive capacities, have FMS in virtue of the past possession of\nthese capacities. But it is unclear how to defend such a claim.\nMoreover, the moral status of permanently severely cognitively\nimpaired humans who never had sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities remains unaccounted for (see the entry on\n cognitive disability and moral status).\n Even the versions of the accounts that offer only sufficient\nconditions for FMS still leave their moral status open and possibly on\na par with animals who similarly lack both the sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities and the capacity to develop them. In Boonin\u2019s case,\nsince he is agnostic about animals and so, presumably, about\ncognitively impaired human beings with similar prospects, his view\nwill either overinclude the former or underinclude the latter, as both\ntypes of beings will be treated on a par.\n5.3 Rudimentary Cognitive Capacities\n\nIn response to the criticisms just discussed, one could lower the\nstandards for the kind of cognitive capacities that are necessary and\nsufficient for FMS. If the relevant cognitive capacities were\nrudimentary enough, even severely cognitively impaired human beings\nwould qualify. Such an account might appeal to the capacity to\nexperience pleasure or pain (sentience), to have interests or basic\nemotions, or the capacity for consciousness. Whether fetuses at\nvarious stages of development will thereby have FMS depends on which\nrudimentary capacity is appealed to. For example, an early fetus has\ninterests but not consciousness.\n\nThis accommodation does not fit well with the commonsense view, which\nwould see it as overinclusive. Most (but not all) animals meet these\nlowered standards for FMS \u2013 they have the capacity for pleasure,\npain, interests, and consciousness \u2013 and so their moral status\nwould be on a par with most human beings (namely all those who possess\nthese rudimentary capacities). For example, some authors claim that\nrespecting rational nature entails respecting beings that have only\nparts of rational nature or necessary conditions of it (Wood 1998, p.\n197). Such a view seems to treat animals, infants, and severely\ncognitively impaired humans, all of whom exhibit only parts of\nrational nature, as morally on a par with each other and with\nunimpaired adult humans. (See O\u2019Neill 1998 for additional\ncritiques of this kind of Kantian approach.) Many advocates of such\nviews explicitly and gladly embrace this inclusiveness and reject the\ncommonsense view of the status of animals (Regan 2004).\n\nSome philosophers only indirectly focus on rudimentary capacities.\nTheir focus is on the \u201cequal moral consideration\u201d of\ninterests, but they make it clear that possessing rudimentary\ncognitive capacities is a necessary condition for having interests.\nUtilitarianism is the best known equal consideration view, e.g.,\nmaintaining that equal amounts of suffering and pleasure should be\nfactored equally into the utilitarian calculus, regardless of whether\nthe suffering and pleasure is that of a human or animal. Equal\nconsideration may be interpreted this way: since equal interests are\ntreated equally, the beings with those interests are of equal moral\nstatus. Singer (1993), famously associated with the equal\nconsideration view, might fit this interpretation. However, because he\nthinks that self-conscious beings have interests that merely conscious\nbeings lack, he allows that the former beings might have rights that\nthe latter lack. Interestingly, DeGrazia (2008) embraces the same\nideas but goes further by saying that beings who have additional\nrights due to more complex interests have a higher, and thus unequal,\nmoral status compared to beings lacking those interests and rights.\nSome non-utilitarian philosophers adopt the terminology of equal moral\nconsideration (e.g., Regan 2004), as do philosophers who wish to\ntranscend the dichotomy between utilitarian and rights-based\napproaches (DeGrazia 1996).\n\nWhile 5.3 accounts and the equal moral consideration approach may seem\nto imply treating human beings and most animals alike, many of the\ndefenders deny this counterintuitive implication by showing that two\nbeings can have equal moral status (or deserve equal consideration)\nand yet require differential treatment due to differences in the\ninterests impacted. What an unimpaired adult human stands to lose in\nbeing killed, for example, is much weightier than what a bird would\nlose. The capacity of foresight, for example, can make for weightier\ninterests, and so human beings with this or other forms of cognitive\nsophistication are harmed more by death (Rachels 1990,\npp.186\u2013194; Regan 2004, pp. 304 and 324; and DeGrazia 1996).\nPotentiality can also explain differential treatment of two beings\nbased on interests impacted, while maintaining the beings\u2019 equal\nmoral status. For example, there is a stronger reason not to harm a\nbaby as opposed to a cat, given the potential of the baby and not the\ncat for a cognitively sophisticated future (Harman 2003, p. 187,\nalthough this is not explicitly an equal consideration view).\nAdmittedly, in some cases comparative judgments of whose interests are\nmorally weightier, and hence judgments about differential treatment,\ncan be difficult, in part due to the difficulties in knowing the\ncapabilities of minds very different from ours and of comparing\nwell-being across species (DeGrazia 1996).\n\nIn spite of allowing for differential treatment of morally equal\nbeings, the above accounts remain unable to capture a key aspect of\nthe commonsense view: they are unable to account for the differential\ntreatment of both conscious humans with severe irreversible cognitive\nimpairments and infants who will die due to disease before acquiring\ncognitive sophistication, as compared with many animals (such as a\ndog), since here the affected interests are similar. Thus, while one\nmay grant that rudimentary capacities ground some moral status, one\nmust look beyond such capacities to explain the difference in moral\nstatus between humans and most animals.\n\nAnderson (2004), although not an advocate of equal consideration,\nmight seem to have a way around this last criticism. She points out\nthat one can have an interest in being dignified in the eyes of the\nhuman community. While both dogs and humans have this interest, what\nit takes for a human with severe cognitive impairments to be dignified\nmight be quite different from what it takes for an animal with similar\ncognitive abilities to be dignified, possibly leading to different\nrights (pp. 282\u20133). However, she doesn\u2019t explain how the\ninterests in dignity can lead to the strong protections associated\nwith FMS, such as the right not to be killed.\n\nIrrespective of whether Anderson succeeds, all equal moral\nconsideration views, despite their name, seem to be incompatible with\nMcMahan\u2019s interpretation of the equal wrongness thesis\n(discussed in section 2.1). Admittedly, these views are explicitly\nconcerned with what should be done rather than with how to evaluate an\naction\u2019s degree of wrongness when one fails to do what one\nshould. Nonetheless, in allowing or even requiring differential\ntreatment based on differences in the interests impacted, such views\nseem to also imply that an action (such as killing) is more wrong if\nit impacts the victim\u2019s interests more severely, whereas McMahan\nholds that the victim\u2019s age or level of intelligence should not\naffect the wrongness of killing.\n\nNotice that an even more rudimentary feature, which is not cognitive,\nwould have to be considered if one were to accord any moral status to\nall living beings. For example, one can appeal to having a good or\nwell-being of one\u2019s own that can be enhanced or damaged as a\nground of moral status (Taylor 1986, p. 75, and Naess 1986, p. 14). If\n\u201cinterests\u201d are understood broadly enough, then\nnonconscious entities, such as plants, species, and ecosystems have\ninterests (e.g., an interest in fulfilling their nature) and thus some\nmoral standing (Johnson 1993, pp. 146, 148, 184, 287). Of course, the\ncentral challenge for such views is to explain how and why inevitable\nconflicts among all those with a well-being or interests should be\nsettled. It is not enough to provide principles adjudicating these\nconflicts (as does Taylor 1986, p. 261); one must justify these\nprinciples in a way that is not grounded in the moral status of the\nbeings under consideration (since their status is taken to be equal).\nFor additional discussion and critique of these and other views, see\nthe entry on\n environmental ethics.\n5.4 Member of Cognitively Sophisticated Species\n\nOne way to avoid the key problems of the previous accounts is to posit\nmembership in the human species as a sufficient condition for FMS.\nThis is not the view that the human species itself has FMS, but rather\nthat membership in the species gives an individual FMS. Feinberg\n(1980) discusses this view, whereas Dworkin (1993, ch. 3) actually\nposits it, although without distinguishing between this version and\nthe modified version addressed below. Benn (1967, pp. 69\u201371)\nconsiders membership in the human species necessary and sufficient for\nFMS. Note that belonging to the human species is a relational feature\n(the relation of being a member of a kind), unlike the features\ninvoked by the accounts considered thus far.\n\nIf there are non-human cognitively sophisticated individuals, such as\nhigher animals or alien species, they would seem to deserve a high\nmoral status equal to that of human beings. Thus, this account should\nnot make human species membership a necessary condition for FMS, but\nrather be disjunctive: having sophisticated cognitive capacities or\nbelonging to the human species is necessary and sufficient for\nFMS.\n\nBy introducing the latter condition (human species membership), such a\nview can establish FMS not only for infants and severely cognitively\nimpaired human beings but even for fetuses and permanently unconscious\nhuman beings. Moreover, any non-human individual who lacks cognitively\nsophisticated capacities, which includes most (but not all) animals,\nlacks FMS. Thus this view accounts rather nicely for much of the\ncommonsense view described in section 1. However, it is of no help\ngrounding the claim that non-human animals, trees, species, or\necosystems have any moral status.\n\nOne possible cost of this approach is the loss of a unified account of\nFMS. That is, there are now two routes to FMS: having sophisticated\ncognitive capacities or belonging to the human species. Whether one is\ncognitively sophisticated is determined purely by psychology, while\nwhether one belongs to the human species is determined purely by\nbiology. Of course, it is true that the human species (as opposed to\nits membership criteria) is characterized both psychologically and\nbiologically, and so in this sense the second route to FMS is related\nto the first.\n\nA second problem is an arbitrary distinction between severely\ncognitively impaired humans and members of other similarly cognitively\nsophisticated species, were they to exist, who have analogous severe\ncognitive impairments. Imagine, for example, a cognitively\nsophisticated biological species of \u201cMartians,\u201d which has\nsome severely cognitively impaired members. Even if an impaired\nMartian and an impaired human have similarly limited cognitive\ncapacities, and even though they bear the same metaphysical relation\nto members of their species (they are both tokens of a biological type\nwhose unimpaired members are cognitively sophisticated), this account\nnevertheless treats them as having a different moral status. This is\nunacceptably arbitrary.\n\nOne could modify this account by substituting membership in a\ncognitively sophisticated species for membership in the human species\nas the second sufficient condition for FMS (Cohen 1986; possibly\nScanlon 1998, pp.185\u201386; and Finnis 1995). This approach is\noften implicit rather than explicitly stated and defended. For\nexample, Korsgaard (2004) regards infants and severely cognitive\nimpaired human beings as rational agents \u2013 presumably in the\nsense of being members of the kind \u201crational agents\u201d\n\u2013 and hence deserving of respect.\n\nThis version of the account is now more unified and avoids the above\ncharge of arbitrariness, while retaining the alignment with the\ncommonsense view. Both sufficient conditions of FMS now ultimately\nappeal to the value of cognitively sophisticated capacities, and\ncognitively impaired members of all cognitively sophisticated species\nhave the same moral status. Moreover, most animals still lack FMS\nsince neither they nor their species are cognitively\nsophisticated.\n\nDespite its advantages, even this modified version has problems.\nFirst, whether one belongs to a given species depends on biological\ncriteria, such as whom one can mate with, whom one is born of, or\nhaving the relevant DNA. But it is unclear why these biological\ncriteria are relevant for moral status. The point can be sharpened\nthis way. The human species, for example, is a morally relevant\ncategory because the species is characterized, in part, by morally\nrelevant properties such as sophisticated intellectual and emotional\ncapacities, and not merely by biological criteria (e.g., mating\nabilities). But it is unclear why a token member of a species, a token\nlacking any of these morally relevant capacities, should get the moral\nstatus from the type it belongs to (the species). If membership in the\ntype does not require any of the morally relevant features, how can\nthe membership be morally relevant? Consequently, this modified\naccount has its own problem of arbitrariness (Feinberg 1980, p. 193;\nSumner 1981, pp. 97\u2013101; and McMahan 2002, pp. 212\u2013214,\n216). McMahan provides an especially interesting imaginary example\ninvolving cognitively enhanced Superchimps, which, on the account\nunder consideration, generates counterintuitive consequences for the\nmoral status of the unenhanced chimps. For example, if the Superchimps\ncame to outnumber ordinary unenhanced chimps, the norm for the chimp\nspecies would have changed and for this reason alone the unenhanced\nchimps would have gained higher moral status. A related\ncounterintuitive consequence, not mentioned by McMahan, is the\nfollowing: if the Superchimps become their own species (via gene\ntherapy and interbreeding), a cognitively impaired member of this\nnewly created Superchimp species with the same cognitive capacities as\na non-impaired ordinary chimp (assumed here not to be sufficiently\ncognitively sophisticated to have FMS) would have a very different\nmoral status from the ordinary chimp. And yet the two chimps would be\nalike in every respect other than their species classification.\n\nNotice also that, on this account, an anencephalic human baby (born\nwithout the higher brain) is a member of the human species and so\nwould have FMS. But some might find this inclusion\ncounterintuitive.\n\nThe possibly problematic inclusion of anencephalic infants does not\nseem to apply to the view underlying Little\u2019s (2008) claim that\nFMS is achieved late in pregnancy (pp. 332 and 348), when the fetus,\nwhich was a human organism, becomes a human being (pp. 339\u2013341).\nShe does not state what the criteria are for being a human being, but\nshe may be partially following Quinn 1984 and conceiving of a human\nbeing as one who belongs to the human species and has the\ncapacity to learn (see her page 340), where the latter feature would\nexclude the anencephalics. While on this view being a human being is\nnot a merely biological matter, the view is still open to the problem\nof arbitrariness insofar as it holds that the morally irrelevant,\nmerely biological feature of membership in the human species does make\na difference to moral status.\n\nOne may think that the above objections can be overcome if the\nrelevant criterion for FMS is not conceived of at all in terms of\nmembership in a cognitively sophisticated biological species,\nbut rather in terms of membership in a cognitively sophisticated\nkind. However, this approach faces a dilemma: either (a) a\ncognitively sophisticated kind does not include members who can never\nbe cognitively sophisticated and thus leaves out many severely\ncognitively impaired human beings or (b) cognitive sophistication is\nnot a requirement of membership in a cognitively sophisticated kind\n(e.g., membership requires merely having the relevant genes even if\ntheir expression is blocked by other genes or the environment), but\nthen this membership does not seem to require any morally relevant\nfeatures (e.g. the genes themselves are not morally relevant \u2013\nsee criticisms along these lines in McMahan 2008), and its moral\nrelevance becomes dubious.\n5.5 Special Relationships\n\nSome views attempt to ground strong reasons not to interfere, and\nperhaps also to aid and treat fairly, not only by appeal to\nsophisticated cognitive capacities but also by appeal to special\nrelationships (these are therefore disjunctive accounts). On such\naccounts, specific agents must not interfere with an\nindividual or must respect that individual\u2019s rights in virtue of\nbeing in a relationship with that individual. On one popular version,\nthe relevant relationship is being a fellow member of a community,\nwhere the community is composed of all those of the same biological\nspecies (Nozick 1997 and possibly Scanlon 1998, p.185).\n\nThe motivation for this version of the Special Relationship account\ncomes from thinking about the species relationship as analogous to\nother relationships (biological, social, etc.) that generate special\nduties and rights. For example, the relationship between a parent and\nhis child creates an especially strong reason for the parent not to\nkill and to aid his child. Also, some people believe that even a\ngamete donor has special reason to aid the resulting child.\n\nOther authors focus on non-species relationships, either as sufficient\nconditions for FMS or as merely enhancers of moral status. Kittay\n(2005) holds that the biosocial relation of being someone\u2019s\nchild is sufficient for FMS while Stienbock (1992, pp.9, 13, and\n69\u201370) maintains that being someone\u2019s child only enhances\none\u2019s moral status. So, for example, having a well-being,\nsentience, or consciousness (all of which both animals and humans\nhave) might be sufficient for some moral status (e.g., weak rights not\nto be harmed and to be aided), but the status is full (e.g., the\nrights are at full strength) when the individual is in a specific\nrelationship with a moral agent. Instead of being someone\u2019s\nchild, the relationship might be co-belonging to a community where the\ncommunity\u2019s membership requirements need not be strictly\nbiological, but could be both biological and cognitive (see\nQuinn\u2019s discussion of rights of humanity 1984, pp.32\u201333\nand 50\u201354), or both biological and social (Warren 1997, p.\n176).\n\nAccording to Anderson (2004), the capacity for reciprocal\naccommodation with moral agents is a necessary (not sufficient)\ncondition of having rights (pp. 287\u20139). This may appear to be a\n5.3 type of view. However, unlike the capacities in 5.3, a rat, for\nexample, might fail to have this mutual accommodation capacity\nvis-\u00e0-vis most humans, and so would not have the right to be\nkilled by these humans; but the rat might nonetheless have this\ncapacity vis-\u00e0-vis other moral agents (human rat lovers,\nangels, etc.), and so might be able to gain this right from these\nagents based on additional conditions. When this capacity for mutual\naccommodation is combined with membership in the human society (which\ndoes not require being a human), then, according to Anderson, this is\nsufficient for a relationship that grounds rights to non-interference\nand aid from human beings, though perhaps not as strong as those\nassociated with FMS (p. 284).\n\nAll of these Special Relationship accounts escape one drawback of the\nMember of a Cognitively Sophisticated Species account. The reason not\nto interfere (or aid, etc.) is not based on being a token of a type\nwith morally irrelevant criteria for membership. Merely belonging to a\nspecies or other type of group is not the source of the reason not to\ninterfere. Instead, by being a member of a species or another group, a\ntoken individual is thereby in a relationship with another token\nmember of the group and this relationship is taken to be the source of\nthe reason not to interfere.\n\nInstead of the capacity for reciprocal accommodation, Gilbert\n(2018) holds that if the rights associated with FMS involve the\nauthority to demand respect for these rights, then such rights must be\ngrounded in an actual joint commitment (p. 332).\n\nA central problem with these approaches is that they do not truly\noffer an account of moral status, but only of particular agents\u2019\nreasons vis-\u00e0-vis the individual at issue. A being\u2019s\nmoral status should give every moral agent, whether human or not,\nreasons to protect that being (see section 2.4). But on these\naccounts, by contrast, only those moral agents who are members of the\nsame species, or are in some other special relationship with the\nbeing, have a reason, let us say, not to kill the being (McMahan 2005,\np. 355). For example, a human being, in virtue of being in a special\nrelationship (via species community) with a human infant, has a reason\nnot to kill the infant, but a Martian, if there were one, would not\nhave this reason, since he would lack this special relationship with\nthe human infant. Similarly, a human being does not have a reason not\nto kill an ape infant, even if adult apes are cognitively\nsophisticated, because the two are not in a special species-based\nrelationship. Reasons of this sort, constitutive of special\nobligations, are different in kind from, and contrasted with, reasons\nconstitutive of moral status, which are impartial. Recall the contrast\nbetween two reasons a parent has not to kill his child: the reason\nconstitutive of his parental obligation versus the impartial reason\nconstitutive of the child\u2019s moral status (section 2.4).\n\nPerhaps some Special Relationship accounts (e.g., Quinn\u2019s\ndiscussion of rights of humanity as distinct from rights of respect)\ndo not take themselves to be offering an account of FMS but rather\nonly to be capturing, e.g., a strong right against others to not be\nkilled (the key component of FMS). If so, they leave behind both the\nterm \u201cmoral status\u201d and the concept of impartiality. Other\nspecial relationship accounts (Steinbock\u2019s and Kittay\u2019s)\ndo use the term \u201cmoral status\u201d leaving it unclear whether\nthey think that special relationships could somehow generate impartial\nreasons.\n\nAnother concern with those Special Relationship accounts that attempt\nto ground rights and requirements analogous to those of FMS is that\nthey are overinclusive (although see exceptions below). If the\nrelevant relationship is one with those in one\u2019s social\ncommunity then, depending on how this is interpreted, any animal\nincorporated into human social communities (e.g., dogs) would gain\nstrong rights, contrary to the commonsense view. If the relevant\nrelationship is instead one with those in one\u2019s species\ncommunity, then all humans are in a special species relationship with\nan anencephalic human baby and so, according to such an account, owe\nit a high level of moral protection. But, as noted earlier, some would\nfind this counterintuitive. A related problem emerges once we notice\nthat humans might have more of a relationship with other\n\u201cembodied minds\u201d (i.e., any being with both a body and\nmind, such as an animal) than with human organisms that lack minds\n(such as an anencephalic baby). The Special Relationship approach\nwould then be committed to claiming that animals have stronger rights\nthan some cognitively impaired humans (McMahan 2002, pp.\n225\u2013226). But the account would not welcome these implications\nof its own approach and, if it did so, it would then suffer the\nproblem of overinclusiveness with respect to animals.\n\nQuinn\u2019s view (1984), although quite similar to the species\ncommunity relationship view, may not be overinclusive with respect to\nanencephalics or animals. Though Quinn does not consider this case, he\nwould likely conclude that anencephalic infants are mere human\norganisms, not human beings (because they lack the capacity to learn),\nor are at most partially, rather than fully, existent human beings.\nThus, they do not stand in a special relationship with other human\nbeings to the degree that unimpaired infants or cognitively impaired\nhuman beings with the capacity to learn do. Moreover, it is plausible\nto accept that we have more of a relationship with human beings in\nQuinn\u2019s sense, which are human embodied minds, than with\nnon-human embodied minds, such as animals. Steinbock\u2019s view also\nwould not be overinclusive with respect to anencephalics or animals,\nsince the full strength of rights she discusses requires both\nconsciousness and being someone\u2019s child.\n\nIt is less clear whether a view like Gilbert\u2019s (2018) is under-\nor overinclusive from the commonsense point of view. Making a joint\ncommitment requires exercising sophisticated cognitive capacities. If\nonly those who actually make joint commitments (to recognize the\nrights associated with FMS) thereby get such rights, then the view is\neven more underinclusive than those described in 5.1, since not all\nthose who can make such joint commitments actually do so (pp.\n341\u2013342). However, if the recipients of rights do not need to be\nmembers of the joint commitment that bestows such rights on them, then\nthe view could end up being overinclusive \u2013 the rights\nassociated with FMS could be extended to anencephalics and all\nanimals.\n\nInsofar as Special Relationship accounts intend to ground the notion\nof FMS without denying that cognitive sophistication alone can ground\nFMS, they will also suffer from another problem encountered earlier:\nthey are not unified since they offer two unconnected routes to FMS\n(sophisticated cognitive capacities or special relationships).\n5.6 Incompletely Realized Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n\nAlmost all the accounts we have considered so far recognize\ncognitively sophisticated capacities as sufficient qualifications for\nFMS. The search for additional sufficient qualifications for FMS,\nmeant to secure the justification for the commonsense view of who\nshould have this highest status, has run into considerable\ndifficulties, chiefly: overinclusion, appeal to criteria of\nquestionable moral relevance, and loss of the impartiality\ncharacteristic of FMS.\n\nJaworska and Tannenbaum (2014) offer an alternative approach, anchored\nin the idea that cognitively sophisticated capacities can be realized\nincompletely. If cognitively sophisticated capacities are sufficient\nto elevate a being\u2019s moral status, so too should the same\nsophisticated capacities incompletely realized.\n\nTo understand this proposal, let\u2019s begin with incompletely\nrealized activities. These are activities one engages in when one\nlearns X \u201cby doing\u201d: e.g., a novice piano player learns to\nplay by slowly reading simple note sequences and pressing (at least\nsome) corresponding piano keys, guided by the end of mastering the\ninstrument. With certain background conditions in place, the pressing\nof the keys is best thought of not as playing the piano badly, but\nrather as incomplete realizations of what piano playing amounts to.\nJaworska and Tannenbaum interpret certain activities of cognitively\nunsophisticated humans analogously. With certain background conditions\nin place, when a child or a cognitively impaired adult models, even in\na most rudimentary way, a cognitively sophisticated activity, guided\nby a mentor\u2019s (parent\u2019s, caretaker\u2019s) end of the\nmentee acquiring cognitive sophistication, the mentee incompletely\nrealizes the corresponding cognitively sophisticated activity. For\ninstance, playing a simple game like\n\u201cI-smile-then-you-smile\u201d becomes rule following as an\nincomplete realization of practical reasoning.\n\nThe key background conditions are: (1) it must be reasonable for the\nmentor to adopt this end and (2) the mentee\u2019s activities must be\nfeasible means of achieving the mentor\u2019s aim. These conditions\nensure a sufficiently firm connection between the mentee\u2019s\nrudimentary activities and the mentor\u2019s end of the mentee\nmastering the sophisticated activity.\n\nNow consider capacities, since they, and not activities, ground moral\nstatus. Unimpaired babies\u2019 activities with their caretakers\ncan straightforwardly fit the above template, so babies have\nthe capacity to incompletely realize cognitively\nsophisticated activities, and thus have the corresponding elevated\nmoral status. Perhaps more surprisingly, even many human beings\nincapable of achieving cognitive sophistication can fit the above\ntemplate. A caretaker of such impaired humans is required, in virtue\nof that role, to have that human\u2019s flourishing as an end, and\nthe flourishing of a human being encompasses developing sophisticated\ncognitive capacities. When circumstances are unfavorable and the\ncaretaker cannot reasonably hold the latter, subsidiary end as an aim\nto be realized, the caretaker can still reasonably hold this end as a\nstandard (meeting condition 1), i.e. as a guide as to what next best\naim to adopt. The activities of many cognitively impaired human beings\ncan be feasible means to the caretaker\u2019s next best aim guided by\nthis standard (meeting condition 2). In this way, these beings have\nthe capacity to incompletely realize cognitively sophisticated\nactivities and so also have the corresponding elevated moral status.\nBy contrast, it would never be reasonable for a dog\u2019s caretaker\nto hold the standard of developing the dog\u2019s cognitive\nsophistication, since the dog can fully flourish without such\nsophistication. Moreover, typically it is also unreasonable to hold\nthe end of making the dog cognitively sophisticated as an aim (not\nmerely as a standard). But even in some odd circumstances a caretaker\ncould reasonably adopt this aim, the activities of the dog would fail\nthe feasibility condition (2). So, either way, dogs lack incompletely\nrealized cognitively sophisticated capacities.\n\nThus, this account overcomes the under- and overinclusion problems of\nthe accounts canvassed above. Moreover, the capacities this account\nappeals to are modest extensions of the capacities deemed morally\nrelevant by a broad spectrum of views. In addition, the account\ngrounds impartial rather than relationship-based reasons for moral\nregard: the feature grounding status is not a relationship but rather\nis vested in the individual, just as the capacity to play a squash\nmatch is vested in the individual even though this requires that\nsomeone could play with her. The main shortcoming of this account is\nthat, although it provides grounds for an elevation of moral status,\nthere is no guarantee that this elevated status reaches the full array\n(and strength) of protections and entitlements associated with FMS.\nThe goal of this particular account was to show that two beings (e.g.\na baby and a dog) who are otherwise cognitively on a par, can have\ndiffering moral statuses in virtue of the fact that one, and not the\nother, currently has cognitively sophisticated capacities incompletely\nrealized. The account assumes that cognitively sophisticated\ncapacities are sufficient for FMS but does not address whether such\nincompletely realized capacities ground FMS or only a somewhat lesser\nmoral status.\n5.7 Other Grounds\n\nIn addition to some of the features noted in section 5.3 (e.g., having\ninterests, having a good, etc.), some philosophers have attempted to\nground the moral status of an entity on features that do not connect\nwith interests in any way. One such feature is not being designed by\nanyone to fulfill any purpose, which some philosophers hold as a\nground for being treated as an end and not a mere means, and thus\nhaving at least some degree of moral status (Brennan 1984, pp. 44 and\n56 and Katz 1997, pp. 129\u2013131). Naturalness, that is, being\nunaltered by humans, has also been proposed as itself a ground of\nintrinsic value, and so as grounding at least some degree of moral\nstatus (Elliot 1997, p. 80). Perhaps harmony and beauty might be yet\nother features one could appeal to as grounds of the moral status of\necosystems (Leopold 1949 and Callicott 1980). These views do not\ndiscuss whether moral status comes in degrees and provide no guidance\nfor how to adjudicate the numerous conflicts that would arise among\nentities with moral status. Insofar as these two issues are addressed\nby supplementing these views with one (or more) of the accounts\ndiscussed in sections 5.1\u20135.6, the views will inherit the\nproblems of those accounts. For elaboration of these and other such\nviews as they arise in environmental ethics, along with critiques, see\nthe entry on\n environmental ethics.\n6. Justifying the Grounds of Moral Status\n\nThe survey in section 5 of the various proposed grounds of moral\nstatus largely sidestepped the question of why the proposed\ngrounds can play their purported role in grounding moral status. What\nis so special about these grounds that they can confer special status\non their possessors? For most of the proposed grounds this issue is\nnot addressed in the literature. However, this issue is addressed\nextensively by some views that take sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities, especially the capacity for autonomy, to ground FMS, and\nalso by some views that take rudimentary cognitive capacities, such as\nsentience, to ground some moral status. So these are the views we will\nbriefly summarize here.\n\nAuthors working within the Kantian tradition have elaborated and\ndefended various versions of the claim that autonomy, or the capacity\nto set ends according to reason, is unconditionally valuable and the\nultimate condition of value of everything else (see the entry on\n autonomy in moral and political philosophy,\n sections 2 and 2.1). Numerous variants of the argument for this claim\ncan be found in the literature, and the most prominent ones take the\ntranscendental form (see the entry on\n transcendental arguments,\n section 5). On one version, in rationally choosing or valuing\nanything at all one must presuppose the supreme value of one\u2019s\nown rational capacities, and, by extension, the supreme value of\nrational capacities in general (Korsgaard 1996a and 1996b). On this\npicture, rational agents must recognize the supreme value of rational\ncapacities as a condition of valuing anything else, and this\nrecognition takes the form of affording FMS to beings with rational\ncapacities. This argument has spawned numerous responses from both\ncritics and proponents. For critiques, see, for example, Regan (2002)\nand Bukoski (2018). For alternative defenses and responses on the\nKantians\u2019 behalf, see Sussman (2003).\n\nSome philosophers have attempted to establish that the capacity to\nvalue confers special status on those who have it due to its\ninstrumental usefulness. For example, Buss (2012) traces the value of\nthis capacity to the value of non-instrumentally valuable things\n(e.g., works of art, beautiful landscapes, animal species) that must\nbe valued (appreciated for their value) in order to be given\n\u201ctheir due\u201d (p. 350, see also p. 358). She claims that\nthough the capacity is merely instrumental, and that beings with this\ncapacity are \u201cvery special instruments\u201d (p. 347, see also\np. 353), nevertheless such beings are to be treated with \u201cawe\nadmiration, and deference\u201d (p. 347) and not merely as a means to\nan end (p. 349). This view is incomplete without an explanation of why\nhuman beings qua instruments ought to be treated with the deference\nowed to what they appreciate (p. 353), given that we do not generally\nhold instruments in the high regard that we hold what they are\nfor.\n\nThere are also those who, inspired by the ancient Greek tradition,\nturn to the \u201cgood for\u201d relation as the underpinning of all\nvalue to defend the claim that the capacity to value confers special\nstatus on those who have it. According to Theunissen (2020), whatever\nis genuinely good for human beings is of value in the sense that it\ngenerates reasons to act accordingly. The capacity to value is good\nfor human beings (is beneficial to them regardless of anyone\u2019s\nattitude or opinion about it) and that explains this capacity\u2019s\nspecial value (p. 127). A daunting challenge for this view is to\nexplain \u2013 without slipping into circularity by claiming that\nhumans have a special moral status \u2013 why the \u201cX is good\nfor humans\u201d relation confers value on X while, in general, the\n\u201cZ is good for Y\u201d relation (e.g., a rabbit is good for\nitself) does not confer analogous value on Z.\n\nContractualist conceptions of morality attempt to derive all of\nmorality, together with full moral status of individuals, from a\nhypothetical reciprocal agreement (entered into under conditions\nspecified variously by different versions) among rational agents (see\nthe entry on\n contractualism).\n The claim is that all able parties would agree (make a contract) to\nbe bound and to bind others to treat them in the agreed-upon ways\n(that encompass FMS). These views work well to explain why the\ncapacity to enter and adhere to such a reciprocal agreement, which\nincludes the capacity to both demand moral status for oneself and to\nrespect the moral status of others by assuming duties and\nresponsibilities, would confer FMS on an individual.\n\nRelated views, such as Gilbert\u2019s (2018), explain the normativity\nof agreements by interpreting them as joint commitments and ground\nrights in actual joint commitment. These views also offer a ready\nexplanation of why those deemed to have the rights do have them, but\nthey do not correlate rights with capacities. If such views were to\nground rights in hypothetical joint commitments, they could explain\nwhy those possessing the sophisticated cognitive capacities required\nto make joint commitments would have the rights.\n\nMore generally, on views that conceive of morality as at least partly\noriginating from rational agents actively binding, obligating, or\nimposing authority on one another, it is easy to see why those with\nsufficient cognitive capacity to impose their authority on others\nwould have FMS that others are bound to respect. For example, Quinn\n(1984) speaks of a \u201cpicture of morality as a nexus of\nindependent spheres of authority to permit, forbid, and require\u201d\n(49) and, because he sees the capacity to will as sufficient for such\nauthority, it is also sufficient for FMS.\n\nUtilitarians and those sympathetic to utilitarian approaches often see\nthe protection and promotion of interests, where this is understood to\npresuppose consciousness, as the central subject matter of morality\n(e.g., DeGrazia 1996, p. 39). On such views it is straightforward why\nthe capacity to have interests is crucial to having any moral status\nat all. On some views, the capacity to experience pleasure or pain\n(sentience) is a prerequisite of having interests and this explains\nwhy sentience is a ground of moral status (Singer 1993, p. 57).\nEnvironmentalists, unlike Utilitarians, do not assume consciousness is\na necessary condition for having interests and hence use the term in a\nbroader fashion. However, they do not explain why interests, broadly\nconstrued in this way, give rise to moral status.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, E., 2004, \u201cAnimal Rights and the Values of\nNonhuman Life,\u201d in <em>Animal Rights: Current Debates and New\nDirections</em>, C.
