    "main_text": "Reasons for Federalism || Reasons to prefer federal orders over a unitary state\n3.2 Reasons to prefer federal orders over a unitary state\n\nThere are several arguments that may apply in favor of federal orders\nover a unitary state. Among the challenges for some of these arguments\nis how to allocate authority when there are conflicting claims to\nprovide different benefits for partly overlapping groups; and how to\nconstruct overrides in cases of emergencies such as pandemics\n(Steytler 2021). Who has the power to decide what are exceptions is\nimportant, even if we may disagree with Schmitt that it defines who is\nsovereign (Schmitt 1985).\n\n\n\nFederal arrangements may protect against central authorities by\nsecuring immunity and non-domination for minority groups or nations.\nConstitutional allocation of powers to a member unit protects\nindividuals from the center, while interlocking arrangements provide\ninfluence on central decisions via member unit bodies (Madison, Hume,\nGoodin 1996). Member units may thus check central authorities and\nprevent undue action contrary to the will of minorities: \u201cA\ngreat democracy must either sacrifice self-government to unity or\npreserve it by federalism. The coexistence of several nations under\nthe same State is a test, as well as the best security of its freedom\n\u2026 The combination of different nations in one State is as\nnecessary a condition of civilized life as the combination of men in\nsociety\u201d (Acton 1907, 277). \n\n\nMore specifically, federal arrangements can accommodate minority\nnations who aspire to self determination, political expressions of\ntheir sense of shared identity and belonging, and the preservation of\ntheir culture, language or religion (Carla 2012). Such autonomy and\nimmunity arrangements are clearly preferable to the political\nconflicts that might result from such groups\u2019 attempts at\nsecession. Central authorities may respond with human rights abuses,\ncivil wars or ethnic cleansing to prevent such secessionist\nmovements. \n\n\nFederal orders may increase the opportunities for citizen\nparticipation in public decision-making; through deliberation and\noffices in both member unit and central bodies that ensures character\nformation through political participation among more citizens (Mill\n1861, ch. 15). \n\n\nFederal orders may facilitate learning by fostering alternative\nsolutions to similar problems and sharing lessons from such a\nlaboratory of \u2018experiments in living\u2019 (Rose-Ackerman\n1980). \n\n\nFederations may facilitate efficient preference maximization more\ngenerally, as formalized in the literature on economic and fiscal\nfederalism\u2014though many such arguments support decentralization\nrather than federalism proper. Research on \u2018fiscal\nfederalism\u2019 addresses the optimal allocation of authority,\ntypically recommending central redistribution but local provision of\npublic goods. Federal arrangements may allow more optimal matching of\nthe authority to create public goods to specific affected subsets of\nthe populations. If individuals\u2019 preferences vary systematically\nby territory according to external or internal parameters such as\ngeography or shared tastes and values, federal\u2014or\ndecentralized\u2014arrangements that allow local variation may be\nwell suited for several reasons. Local decisions prevent overload of\ncentralised decision-making, and local decision-makers may also have a\nbetter grasp of affected preferences and alternatives, making for\nbetter service than would be provided by a central government that\ntends to ignore local preference variations (Smith 1776, 680).\nGranting powers to population subsets that share preferences regarding\npublic services may also increase efficiency by allowing these subsets\nto create such \u2018internalities\u2019 and \u2018club\ngoods\u2019 at costs borne only by them (Musgrave 1959, 179\u201380,\nOlson 1969, Oates\u2019 1972 \u2018Decentralization\nTheorem\u2019). \n\n\nFederal arrangements can also shelter territorially based groups with\npreferences that diverge from the majority population, such as ethnic\nor cultural minorities, so that they are not subject to majority\ndecisions severely or systematically contrary to their preferences.\nNon-unitary arrangements may thus minimize coercion and be responsive\nto as many citizens as possible (Mill 1861 ch. 15, Elazar 1968;\nLijphart 1999). Such considerations of economic efficiency and\nmajority decisions may favor federal solutions, with \u201conly\nindivisibilities, economies of scale, externalities, and strategic\nrequirements \u2026 acceptable as efficiency arguments in favor of\nallocating powers to higher levels of government\u201d\n(Padou-Schioppa 1995, 155). \n\n\nFederal arrangements may not only protect existing clusters of\nindividuals with shared values or preferences, but may also promote\nmobility and hence territorial clustering of individuals with similar\npreferences. Member unit autonomy to experiment may foster competition\nfor individuals who are free to move where their preferences are best\nmet. Such mobility towards member units with like-minded individuals\nmay add to the benefits of local autonomy over the provision of public\nservices\u2014absent economies of scale and externalities (Tiebout\n1956, Buchanan 2001)\u2014though the result may be that those with\ncostly needs and who are less mobile are left worse off. \n\n",
