    "main_text": "Naturalizing the Mind\n7. Naturalizing the Mind\n\nNaturalism\n is a movement that seeks to ground philosophical theorizing in the\nscientific enterprise. As so often in philosophy, different authors\nuse the term \u201cnaturalism\u201d in different ways. Usage within\nphilosophy of mind typically connotes an effort to depict mental\nstates and processes as denizens of the physical world, with no\nirreducibly mental entities or properties allowed. In the modern era,\nphilosophers have often recruited LOTH to advance naturalism. Indeed,\nLOTH\u2019s supposed contribution to naturalism is frequently cited\nas a significant consideration in its favor. One example is\nFodor\u2019s use of CCTM+FSC to explain semantic coherence. The other\nmain example turns upon the problem of intentionality.\n\nHow does intentionality arise? How do mental states come to be\nabout anything, or to have semantic properties? Brentano\n(1874 [1973: 97]) maintained that intentionality is a hallmark of the\nmental as opposed to the physical: \u201cThe reference to something\nas an object is a distinguishing characteristic of all mental\nphenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything similar\u201d. In\nresponse, contemporary naturalists seek to naturalize\nintentionality. They want to explain in naturalistically\nacceptable terms what makes it the case that mental states have\nsemantic properties. In effect, the goal is to reduce the intentional\nto the non-intentional. Beginning in the 1980s, philosophers have\noffered various proposals about how to naturalize intentionality. Most\nproposals emphasize causal or nomic links between mind and world\n(Aydede & G\u00fczeldere 2005; Dretske 1981; Fodor 1987, 1990;\nStalnaker 1984), sometimes also invoking teleological factors\n(Millikan 1984, 1993; Neander 2017l; Papineau 1987; Dretske 1988) or\nhistorical lineages of mental states (Devitt 1995; Field 2001).\nAnother approach, functional role semantics, emphasizes the\nfunctional role of a mental state: the cluster of causal or\ninferential relations that the state bears to other mental states. The\nidea is that meaning emerges at least partly through these causal and\ninferential relations. Some functional role theories cite causal\nrelations to the external world (Block 1987; Loar 1982), and others do\nnot (Cummins 1989).\n\nEven the best developed attempts at naturalizing intentionality, such\nas Fodor\u2019s (1990) version of the nomic strategy, face serious\nproblems that no one knows how to solve (M. Greenberg 2014; Loewer\n1997). Partly for that reason, the flurry of naturalizing attempts\nabated in the 2000s. Burge (2010: 298) reckons that the naturalizing\nproject is not promising and that current proposals are\n\u201chopeless\u201d. He agrees that we should try to illuminate\nrepresentationality by limning its connections to the physical, the\ncausal, the biological, and the teleological. But he insists that\nillumination need not yield a reduction of the intentional to the\nnon-intentional.\n\nLOTH is neutral as to the naturalization of intentionality. An LOT\ntheorist might attempt to reduce the intentional to the\nnon-intentional. Alternatively, she might dismiss the reductive\nproject as impossible or pointless. Assuming she chooses the reductive\nroute, LOTH provides guidance regarding how she might proceed.\nAccording to RTT,\n\n\nX A\u2019s that p iff there is a mental\nrepresentation S such that X bears A* to S\nand S means that p.\n\n\nThe task of elucidating \u201cX A\u2019s that\np\u201d in naturalistically acceptable terms factors into two\nsub-tasks (Field 2001: 33):\n\n Explain in naturalistically acceptable terms what it is to bear\npsychological relation A* to mental representation\nS.\n Explain in naturalistically acceptable terms what it is for\nmental representation S to mean that p.\n\n\nAs we have seen, functionalism helps with (a). Moreover, COMP provides\na blueprint for tackling (b). We can first delineate a compositional\nsemantics describing how S\u2019s meaning depends upon\nsemantic properties of its component words and upon the compositional\nimport of the constituency structure into which those words are\narranged. We can then explain in naturalistically acceptable terms why\nthe component words have the semantic properties that they have and\nwhy the constituency structure has the compositional import that it\nhas.\n\nHow much does LOTH advance the naturalization of intentionality? Our\ncompositional semantics for Mentalese may illuminate how the semantic\nproperties of a complex expression depend upon the semantic properties\nof primitive expressions, but it says nothing about how primitive\nexpressions get their semantic properties in the first place.\nBrentano\u2019s challenge (How could intentionality arise from\npurely physical entities and processes?) remains unanswered. To\nmeet the challenge, we must invoke naturalizing strategies that go\nwell beyond LOTH itself, such as the causal or nomic strategies\nmentioned above. Those naturalizing strategies are not specifically\nlinked to LOTH and can usually be tailored to semantic properties of\nneural states rather than semantic properties of Mentalese\nexpressions. Thus, it is debatable how much LOTH ultimately helps us\nnaturalize intentionality. Naturalizing strategies orthogonal to LOTH\nseem to do the heavy lifting.\n",
