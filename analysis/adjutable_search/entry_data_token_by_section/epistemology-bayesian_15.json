See H\u00e1jek (2003) for some\nobjections to the definitional construal and for further\ndiscussion.\n\nWhether the Ratio Formula is construed as a definition or a norm, it\napplies only when the conditioning proposition \\(B\\) is assigned a\nnonzero credence: \\(\\Cr(B) \\neq 0\\). But perhaps this qualification is\ntoo restrictive:\n\n\nExample (Coin, Continued). Conditional on\n\u201cthe coin is fair\u201d, the agent has a 0.5 credence in\n\u201cthe coin will land heads the next time it is\ntossed\u201d\u2014and rightly so. But this agent assigns a\nzero credence in the conditioning proposition, \u201cthe\ncoin is fair\u201d, as in the previous Coin Case.\n\n\n\nThis 0.5 conditional credence seems to make perfect sense, but it\neludes the Ratio Formula. Worse, the above case is not rare: the above\nconditional credence is a credence in an event conditional on a\nstatistical hypothesis, and such conditional credences, often called\nlikelihoods, have been extensively employed in statistical\napplications of Bayesian epistemology (as will be explained in\n section 3.5).\n\nThere are three possible ways out. They differ in the importance they\nattribute to the Ratio Formula as a stand-alone norm. So you can\nexpect a reformatory approach which takes it to be unimportant, a\nconservative one which retains its importance, and a middle way\nbetween the two.\n\nOn the reformatory approach, the Ratio Formula is no longer\nimportant and, instead, is derived as a mere consequence of something\nmore fundamental. While the standard Bayesian view takes norms of\nunconditional credences to be fundamental and then uses the Ratio\nFormula as a bridge to conditional credences, the reformatory approach\nreverses the direction, taking norms of conditional credences as\nfundamental. Following Popper (1959) and R\u00e9nyi (1970), this\nidea can be implemented with a version of Probabilism designed\ndirectly for conditional credences:\n\n\n\n\nProbabilism (Conditional Version). It ought to be\nthat one\u2019s assignment of conditional credences \\(\\Cr( \\wcdot\n\\mid \\wcdot)\\) is a Popper-R\u00e9nyi function over an algebra\n\\({\\cal A}\\) of propositions, namely, a function satisfying the\nfollowing axioms:\n\n(Probability) For any logically consistent\nproposition \\(A \\in {\\cal A}\\) held fixed, \\(\\Cr( \\wcdot \\mid A)\\) is\na probability measure on \\({\\cal A}\\) with \\(\\Cr( A \\mid A) =\n1\\).\n\n\n(Multiplication) For any propositions \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in \\({\\cal A}\\) such that \\(B \\cap C\\) is logically\nconsistent, \n\\[\\Cr(A\\cap B \\mid C)  = \\Cr(A \\mid B \\cap C) \\cdot \\Cr(B \\mid C) .\\]\n \n \n\n\n\nThis approach is often called the approach of coherent conditional\nprobability, because it seeks to impose coherence constraints\ndirectly on conditional credences without a detour through\nunconditional credences. Once those constraints are in place, one may\nthen add a constraint\u2014normative or definitional\u2014on\nunconditional credences: \n\\[\\Cr(A) = \\Cr(A \\mid \\top),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\top\\) is a logical truth. From the above we can derive the\nRatio Formula and the standard version of Probabilism. See\nH\u00e1jek (2003) for a defense of this approach. A Dutch Book\nargument for the conditional version of Probabilism is developed by\nStalnaker (1970).\n\nIn contrast to the reformatory nature of the above approach, the\nsecond one is conservative. On this approach, the Ratio\nFormula is sufficient by itself as a norm (or definition) for\nconditional credences. It makes sense to have a credence conditional\non \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d because one\u2019s credence in that\nconditioning proposition ought to be an infinitesimal rather than\nzero. This approach may be called the approach of\ninfinitesimals. It forms a natural package with the\ninfinitesimal approach to saving Regularity from the Coin Case, which\nwas discussed in\n section 3.3.\n\nBetween the conservative and the reformatory, there is the\nmiddle way, due to Kolmogorov (1933). The idea is to think\nabout the cases where the Ratio Formula applies, and then use them to\n\u201capproximate\u201d the cases where it does not apply. If this\ncan be done, then although the Ratio Formula is not all there is to\nnorms for conditional credences, it comes close. To be more precise,\nwhen we try to conditionalize on a zero-credence proposition \\(B\\), we\ncan approximate \\(B\\) by a sequence of propositions \\(B_1,\\)\n\\(B_2,\\)\u2026 such that:\n\nthose propositions \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots\\) are progressively more\nspecific (i.e., \\(B_i \\supset B_{i+1}\\)),\nthey jointly say what \\(B\\) says (i.e., \\(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty}\nB_i = B\\)).\n\n\nIn that case, it seems tempting to accept the norm or definition that\nconditionalization on \\(B\\) be approximated by successive\nconditionalizations on \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots\\), or in symbols:\n\n\\[\\Cr(A \\mid B) = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty}\\Cr(A \\mid B_i),\\]\n\n\nwhere each term \\(\\Cr(A \\mid B_i)\\) is governed by the Ratio Formula\nbecause \\(\\Cr(B_i)\\) is nonzero by design. An important consequence of\nthis approach is that, when one chooses a different sequence of\npropositions to approximate \\(B\\), the limit of conditionalizations\nmight be different, and, hence, a credence conditional on \\(B\\) is, or\nought to be, relativized to how one presents \\(B\\) as the limit of a\nsequence of approximating propositions. This relativization is often\nillustrated with what\u2019s called the Borel-Kolmogorov\nparadox; see Rescorla (2015) for an accessible presentation and\ndiscussion. Once the mathematical details are refined, this approach\nbecomes what\u2019s known as the theory of regular conditional\n probability.[5]\n A Dutch Book argument for this way of assigning conditional credences\nis developed by Rescorla (2018).\n\nFor a critical comparison of those three approaches to conditional\ncredences, see the survey by Easwaran (2019).\n\n\n",
