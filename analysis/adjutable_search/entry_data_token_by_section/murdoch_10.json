    "main_text": "Moral Reality and Moral Realism || Metaphor\n5.6 Metaphor\n\nIn addition to but interwoven with the differences mentioned, other\npersons, the Good, and metaphysics (or a particular metaphysical\nsystem or concept) also embody distinct metaphors for understanding\nmoral reality. Murdoch often emphasizes the importance of metaphor in\nthinking, especially in philosophy where, in the analytic tradition,\nthere is an often tacit assumption that any metaphorical use of\nlanguage can be given a purely literal rendering. Murdoch entirely\nrejects this way of thinking about language and understanding and\noften talks of exploring metaphors. \n\n\nMetaphors are not merely peripheral decorations or even useful models,\nthey are fundamental forms of our awareness of our condition. (SGC:\n77/363, and elsewhere 93f/377) \n\n\nThe \u201cother persons\u201d strand involves an image of a struggle\nof each moral agent to grasp the other person(s) in their particular\nworld as distinct persons, as equally real as themselves. The metaphor\nof Good involves a reaching to an abstract and implied-to-be\n\u201chigher\u201d entity. The metaphor of \u201cmetaphysics\u201d\ngenerally evokes an elaborated system within which the individual\nagent is placed. The metaphorical dimension (with the differences\namong the three) is integral to our understanding of each strand.\n",
