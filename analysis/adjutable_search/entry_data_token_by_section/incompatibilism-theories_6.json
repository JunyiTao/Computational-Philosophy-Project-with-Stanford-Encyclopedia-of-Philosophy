    "main_text": "Event-Causal Theories || Centered Accounts\n2.2 Centered Accounts\n\nEvent-causal accounts of a more typical sort require that at least\nsome free actions be nondeterministically caused by their immediate\ncausal antecedents. Since these views require indeterminism centered\non the production of free actions themselves, we may call them\n\u201ccentered accounts.\u201d The most widely discussed such view\nis that advanced by Robert Kane (1985, 1989, 1994, 1996a, 1996b,\n1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2002, 2004, 2005: chs. 11\u201312,\n2007a, 2007b, 2011, 2014a, 2014b, 2016, and 2019). (It should\nbe noted that Kane now rejects the event-causal label, insisting the\nthere is no event-causal reduction of agency; however, it is not clear\nthat he denies that agency is always fully realized in causation by\nevents, and his view focuses on causation by events in exercises of\nagency.) Other accounts of this type are proposed by Mark Balaguer\n(1999 and 2004), Laura Ekstrom (2019), Christopher Franklin (2011a,\n2011b, 2018), David Hodgson (2012), Alfred Mele (2006: ch. 5), Robert\nNozick (1981:294\u2013316), Richard Sorabji (1980: chs. 2 and 14),\nPeter van Inwagen (1983: 137\u201350), and David Wiggins (1973). John\nSearle (2001: ch. 9) endorses a view of this sort as best capturing\nour experience of acting.\n\nConsider an illustration of a simple centered incompatibilist theory.\nSuppose that Elena is considering whether to A or to B. She recognizes\nwhat she regards as fairly strong reasons to A, and she recognizes\nwhat she regards as somewhat weaker reasons to B. At a certain time,\nt, she decides to A. The account requires that the prior deliberative\nevents (such as Elena\u2019s recognizing the reasons to A and judging\nthem to be stronger) that cause the decision to A nondeterministically\ncause it, and that until Elena makes that decision, there remains a\nchance that she not make that decision then. (We may imagine that\nthere remains a chance that, instead, she decides at t to B, in which\ncase prior deliberative events, such as her recognizing the reasons to\nB, will have nondeterministically caused this alternative\ndecision).\n\nAccounts of this sort are often thought to be vulnerable to the\nproblem of luck. There are a various formulations of the problem of\nluck. (Versions of it are advanced by Almeida and Bernstein [2003],\nEkstrom [2000: 105], Haji [1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, and\n2001], Levy [2011: ch. 3], and Strawson [1994]. Mele [1998, 1999a,\n1999b, 2005, and 2006: chs 1 and 5] discusses the argument but rejects\nits conclusion.) Here is one version: suppose an agent decides to\nsteal. If there was a chance, right at the moment of choice, that the\nagent will instead (at that moment) make a different decision, then\nthere is a possible world that is exactly the same as the actual world\nup until the time of the decision, but in which the agent makes the\nalternative decision then. There is, then, nothing about the agent\nprior to the decision\u2014indeed, there is nothing about the world\nprior to that time\u2014that accounts for the difference between her\nmaking one decision and her making the other. This difference, then,\nis just a matter of luck. And if the difference between the\nagent\u2019s making one decision and her instead making another is\njust a matter of luck, she cannot be responsible for the decision that\nshe makes.\n\nOne response to the problem of luck rejects the claim that there is\nnothing about the agent prior to the decision that accounts for the\ndifference between her making one decision and her making the other.\nAfter all, the agent acted for reasons (e.g., a desire for money). If\nthose reasons raised the probability of deciding to steal and\nnon-deterministically caused the decision, that is enough to account\nfor the decision (in a sense that makes it not just a matter of luck).\nIn the world where she decides not to steal, the reasons that increase\nthe probability of that choice (e.g., a desire to act rightly) would\nthen account for the alternative decision. No matter what the agent\nchooses, we can give a contrastive explanation of her action (this\nmeans we can explain why she chose that act rather than the\nalternative.) Franklin (2018) develops (more complex) replies along\nthese lines.\n\nAnother response to the problem of luck is offered by Mele (2006:\n117\u201333). Mele invokes an agent\u2019s influence, by way of her\npast actions, on which options are currently open to her and what\ntheir respective probabilities are. Given her responsibility for those\npast actions, the agent might be responsible for the current\nprobabilities of her pursuing these alternatives. For example, Elena\nmight be responsible for the present chance that she will decide\ncontrary to her ranking of her reasons, because she is responsible for\npast actions that led to her now having features\u2014character\ntraits, desires, and so forth\u2014that ground that chance. An agent\nmight, in this fashion, accumulate over the course of her lifetime\ngreater responsibility for what she does, by increasingly shaping the\nprobabilities of her acting in various ways.\n\nOf course, the maneuver raises a question about how the agent could be\nresponsible for her earlier actions, given that the account in\nquestion will require that some of these, too, were\nnondeterministically caused. Ultimately, we must consider how an agent\ncan be responsible, on such a view, for her earliest free\ndecisions.\n\nThese earliest free decisions, Mele observes, will be those of a\nrelatively young child. Responsibility comes in degrees, and any\nresponsibility such a child has for what she does will be slight. The\nargument from luck might seem threatening if we think that full\nresponsibility is in question, but it loses its bite, Mele suggests,\nwhen we consider a case in which only a small degree of responsibility\nis at issue. It is implausible, for example, to say that a young boy\nwho decides not to snatch away his sister\u2019s toy deserves no\ncredit at all for making the right decision, just because there\nremained until he so decided a chance that he would instead decide to\ntake the toy. Kane (e.g., at 2007b: 174\u201375) makes a similar\nappeal to the build-up of responsibility stemming from slight\nresponsibility for one\u2019s earliest free choices.\n\nCentered accounts also face the problem of enhanced control. Note that\nthe simple centered account we are considering differs from typical\ncompatibilist accounts only by requiring that the agent\u2019s mental\nstates nondeterministically cause her decision. How does this\ndifference in the nature of the causal relationship do anything to\nenhance the agent\u2019s control over her act?\n\n\nA popular response to this question says that indeterminism enhances\ncontrol because it is necessary for the agent to possess the ability\nor opportunity to do otherwise. And having the ability or opportunity\nto do otherwise increases control. Franklin (2011a and 2018) and\nEkstrom (2019) offer responses along these lines. Kane makes a similar\npoint. On the indeterministic picture: an agent exercises dual\ncontrol, a control that can be exercised in either of two different\nways, whereas on the deterministic picture the agent\u2019s control\ncan be exercised in only one way (Kane 1996: 109\u201311).\n\nSome proponents of centered incompatibilist theories have added to the\nrequirements of the rather simple view we have been considering, with\nthe aim of rebutting the problem of luck. We shall examine here the\naccount advanced by Robert Kane.\n",
