    "main_text": "Divine Forgiveness\n7. Divine Forgiveness\n\nThe topic of God\u2019s relation to human wrongdoing is an important\none in mainstream Western theological and philosophical discussions of\nforgiveness, but it is by no means clear what the relationship is\nsupposed to be between God and forgiveness, and the connection between\nthat and the possibility of forgiveness between persons. This is\nbecause there is some question whether the differences between divine\nand human forgiveness are so significant that any comparison between\nthem is inapt. As one author puts the point, \n\n\nThe difference between the human and the divine should not be\nunderestimated, and it is possible that it would not just be over\noptimistic but actually dangerous to expect people to model their\nbehavior on God. (Tombs 2008: 592) \n\n\nThe concern expressed in this remark is that whereas God\u2019s\nforgiveness is supposedly unilateral, unilateral human forgiveness may\nbe irresponsible, as when a victim of wrongdoing forgives a wrongdoer\nirrespective of any signs of repentance on the part of the wrongdoer.\nAnother writer argues that the gap between human and divine\nforgiveness is unbridgeable, for God\u2019s forgiveness is grounded\nin \u201ceschatological divine justice\u201d not, as in human\nforgiveness, in an awareness of \u201csinful solidarity with\nhumanity\u201d (Williams 2008: 584\u2013585).\n\nIf divine forgiveness is possible, what is its nature? Douglas Drabkin\nreports that \u201cthere is no other way that God can forgive us, as\nfar as I can see, except through a change in emotion\u201d (1993:\n237). What kind of emotional changes might be at issue? For many, the\nobvious candidate will be resentment. And so on this view, when we do\nwrong, God has resentment towards us. To follow Jonathan Edwards, we\nare \u201csinners in the hands of an angry God\u201d. God forgives\nus by eliminating that resentment (though see Minas 1975).\n\nOne need not think that God gives up resentment, however, to adopt an\nemotion theory of divine forgiveness. Douglas Drabkin has argued that\nthere is a kind of emotional change that is natural to suppose that\nGod experiences and that this change is a good candidate for divine\nforgiveness. On his view, God, like any loving parent, will\n\u201csuffer on our account\u201d when we do evil (235). \u201cWhen\nwe repent\u201d, he says, \u201cGod feels our joy and ceases to\nsuffer\u201d (235). He concludes: \u201cThis, I am suggesting, is\nhow God forgives us: by rejoicing in our repentance\u201d (235).\nHowever, on those theological views according to which God is\nimpassible (i.e., God is unable to suffer or have reactive emotions),\nthese kinds of emotion views will be off the table (see, e.g.,\nGavrilyuk 2004).\n\nAnother approach to divine forgiveness says that God forgives by\nforbearing punishment. Some philosophical discussions of divine\nforgiveness have proceeded as if this view (or something very much\nlike it) is the default position. For example, David Londey proceeds\nto answer this question by operating with a conception of forgiveness\nthat crucially involves the remission of any \u201cpenalty or\nsanction\u201d, including \u201cmoral censure\u201d and \u201cmore\ntangible punishments\u201d that a wrongdoer is due (1986: 5). In\ntheir respective replies to Londey defending the possibility of divine\nforgiveness, Andrew Brien and Dean Geuras each assume a\npunishment-forbearance view according to which forgiveness is the\nforbearing of any punishment one ought to inflict (Brien 1989: 35) and\nthe remission of a deserved penalty (Geuras 1992: 65). Swinburne\nargues that God\u2019s forgiveness is akin to the forgiveness of a\nkind of debt: when God forgives us, the guilt that our wrongdoing\nincurred is wiped away (1989). See also Bash (2015), Brien (1989),\nMackintosh (1927), Minas (1975), and Scheiber (2001).\n",
