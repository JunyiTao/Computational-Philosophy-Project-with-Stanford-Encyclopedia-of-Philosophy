    "main_text": "Inertial frames in the 20th century: special and general relativity || Inertial frames in Newtonian spacetime\n2.1 Inertial frames in Newtonian spacetime\n\nBy the early years of the 20th century, the notion of\ninertial system seems to have been widely accepted as the basis for\nNewtonian mechanics, even if the specific works of Lange and Thomson\nwere little noticed. In writing \u201cOn the electrodynamics of\nmoving bodies\u201d in 1905, Einstein took it to be obvious to his\nreaders that classical mechanics does not require a single privileged\nframe of reference, but an equivalence-class of frames, all in uniform\nmotion relative to each other, and in any of which \u201cthe\nequations of mechanics hold good.\u201d Two inertial frames with\ncoordinates \\((x, y, z, t)\\) and \\((x', y', z', t')\\) are related by\nthe Galilean transformations, \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n x' &= x - vt \\\\\n y' &= y \\\\\n z' &= z \\\\\n t' &= t\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n(assuming that the x-axis is defined to be the direction of their\nrelative motion). These transformations clearly preserve the invariant\nquantities of Newtonian mechanics, i.e. acceleration, force, and mass\n(and therefore time, length, and simultaneity). As far as Newtonian\nmechanics was concerned, then, the problem of absolute motion was\ncompletely solved; all that remained was to express the equivalence of\ninertial frames in a simpler geometrical structure. \n\nThe lack of a privileged spatial frame, combined with the obvious\nexistence of privileged states of motion\u2014paths defined as\nrectilinear in space and uniform with respect to time\u2014suggests\nthat the geometrical situation ought to be regarded from a\nfour-dimensional spatio-temporal point of view.\u00a0The\nstructure defined by the class of inertial frames can be captured in\nthe statement that space-time is a four-dimensional affine\nspace, whose straight lines (geodesics) are the trajectories of\nparticles in uniform rectilinear motion. See Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Inertial Trajectories as\nStraight Lines of Space-time\n\n\nThat is, space-time is a structure whose automorphisms\u2014the\nGalilean transformations that relate one inertial frame to\nanother\u2014are affine transformations: they take straight lines\ninto straight lines, and parallel lines into parallel lines. The\nformer condition implies that an inertial motion in one frame will be\nan inertial motion in any other frame, and likewise for an\naccelerating or rotational motion. The latter implies that\nuniformly-moving particles or observers who are relatively at rest in\none frame will also be relatively at rest in another. An inertial\nframe can be characterized as a family of parallel straight lines\n\u201cfilling\u201d space-time, representing the possible\ntrajectories of a family of free particles that are relatively at\nrest. See Figure 5. Therefore, to assert that an inertial frame exists\nis to impose a global structure on space-time; it is equivalent to the\nassertion that space-time is an affine space that is flat. \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Each of these families of\nstraight lines, \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\), represents the trajectories of a\nfamily of free particles that are relatively at rest, and therefore\neach defines an inertial frame. Relative to each other, the frames\ndefined by \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\) are in uniform motion.\n\nEach of the surfaces S is a \u201chypersurface of absolute\nsimultaneity\u201d representing all of space at a given moment;\nevidently (given the Galilean transformations) two inertial frames\nwill agree on which events in space-time are simultaneous.\n\n\nThe form of the Galilean transformations shows that, in addition to\nbeing affine transformations, they also preserve metrical relations on\ntime and space. Distinct inertial frames will agree on simultaneity,\nand on (ratios of) time-intervals; they will also agree on the spatial\ndistance between points at a given moment of time. Therefore, in the\nfour-dimensional picture, the decomposition of space-time into\nhypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity is independent of the choice of\ninertial frame. Another way of putting this is that Newtonian\nspace-time is endowed with a projection of space onto time,\ni.e. a function that identifies space-time points that have the same\ntime-coordinate. Similarly, absolute space arises from a projection of\nspace-time onto space, i.e. a function that identifies space-time\npoints that have the same spatial coordinates. See Figure 6. \n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nBut Galilean relativity implies that this latter projection is\narbitrary. While it assumes that we can identify the same time at\ndifferent spatial locations, Newtonian mechanics provides no physical\nway of identifying the same spatial point at different times. Thus the\nequivalence of inertial frames can be thought of as the arbitrariness\nof the projection of space-time onto space. Any such projection is,\nessentially, the arbitrary choice of some particular inertial frame as\na rest-frame. In the relativized version of Newton\u2019s theory,\nthen, the class of inertial frames replaces absolute space, while\nabsolute time remains. The structure of Newtonian space-time (also\nknown as Galilean space-time, or neo-Newtonian space-time) expresses\nthis fact in a direct and obvious way. (See Stein 1967 and Ehlers 1973\nfor further explanation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFigure 7:\n(a) Here is a space-time diagram of motions relative to the inertial\nframe in which \\(O_1\\), \\(O_2\\), and \\(P_1\\) are at rest. This can be\nseen as arising from the projection of each of their inertial\ntrajectories onto a single point of space. \\(O_3\\) is in uniform\nmotion. \\(O_4\\) is accelerating any old way. \\(O_5\\) and \\(O_6\\) are\nrevolving around their common center of gravity \\(P_1\\), which (as\nnoted above) is at rest. \\(O_7\\) and \\(O_8\\) are revolving around\ntheir center of gravity \\(P_2\\), which is in uniform motion.\n\n(b) Here is the same situation viewed from an inertial frame in which\n\\(O_3\\) and \\(P_2\\) are at rest. Now \\(O_1,\\) \\(O_2,\\) and \\(P_1\\) are\nin uniform motion. \\(O_4\\) is accelerating any old way. \\(O_5\\) and\n\\(O_6\\) are revolving around their common center of gravity \\(P_1\\),\nwhich is in uniform motion. \\(O_7\\) and \\(O_8\\) are revolving around\ntheir center of gravity \\(P_2\\), which (as noted above) is at\nrest.\n\n",
