    "main_text": "\n\nAlgebra is a branch of mathematics sibling to geometry, analysis\n(calculus), number theory, combinatorics, etc. Although algebra has\nits roots in numerical domains such as the reals and the complex\nnumbers, in its full generality it differs from its siblings in\nserving no specific mathematical domain. Whereas geometry treats\nspatial entities, analysis continuous variation, number theory integer\narithmetic, and combinatorics discrete structures, algebra is equally\napplicable to all these and other mathematical domains.\n\nElementary algebra, in use for centuries and taught in\nsecondary school, is the arithmetic of indefinite quantities or\nvariables \\(x, y,\\ldots\\). Whereas the definite sum \\(3+4\\) evaluates\nto the definite quantity 7, the indefinite sum \\(x+y\\) has no definite\nvalue, yet we can still say that it is always equal to \\(y+x\\), or to\n\\(x^2 -y^2\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is either \\(-y\\) or \\(y+1\\).\n\nElementary algebra provides finite ways of managing the infinite. A\nformula such as \\(\\pi r^2\\) for the area of a circle of radius \\(r\\)\ndescribes infinitely many possible computations, one for each possible\nvaluation of its variables. A universally true law expresses\ninfinitely many cases, for example the single equation \\(x+y = y+x\\)\nsummarizes the infinitely many facts \\(1+2 = 2+1, 3+7 = 7+3\\), etc.\nThe equation \\(2x = 4\\) selects one number from an infinite set of\npossibilities. And \\(y = 2x+3\\) expresses the infinitely many points\nof the line with slope 2 passing through \\((0, 3)\\) with a finite\nequation whose solutions are exactly those points.\n\nElementary algebra ordinarily works with real or complex values.\nHowever its general methods, if not always its specific operations and\nlaws, are equally applicable to other numeric domains such as the\nnatural numbers, the integers, the integers modulo some integer \\(n\\),\nthe rationals, the quaternions, the Gaussian integers, the \\(p\\)-adic\nnumbers, and so on. They are also applicable to many nonnumeric\ndomains such as the subsets of a given set under the operations of\nunion and intersection, the words over a given alphabet under the\noperations of concatenation and reversal, the permutations of a given\nset under the operations of composition and inverse, etc. Each such\nalgebraic structure, or simply algebra, consists of\nthe set of its elements and operations on those elements obeying the\nlaws holding in that domain, such as the set \\(Z = \\{0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2,\n\\ldots \\}\\) of integers under the integer operations \\(x+y\\) of\naddition, \\(xy\\) of multiplication, and \\(-x\\), negation, or the set\n\\(2^X\\) of subsets of a set \\(X\\) under the set operations \\(X\\cup Y\\)\nof union, \\(X\\cap Y\\) of intersection, and \\(X'\\), complement relative\nto \\(X\\).\n\nThe laws are often similar but not identical. For example integer\nmultiplication distributes over addition, \\(x(y+z) = xy+xz\\), but not\nconversely, for example \\(2+(3\\times 5) = 17\\) but \\((2+3)\\times(2+5)\n= 35\\). In the analogy that makes intersection the set theoretic\ncounterpart of multiplication and union that of addition, intersection\ndistributes over union, \n\\[ X\\cap(Y\\cup Z) = (X\\cap Y)\\cup(X\\cap Z), \\]\n\n\nas for the integers, but unlike the integers union also distributes\nover intersection: \n\\[ X\\cup(Y\\cap Z) = (X\\cup Y)\\cap(X\\cup Z). \\]\n\n\nWhereas elementary algebra is conducted in a fixed algebra,\nabstract or modern algebra treats classes of\nalgebras having certain properties in common, typically those\nexpressible as equations. The subject, which emerged during the 19th\ncentury, is traditionally introduced via the classes of groups, rings,\nand fields. For example any number system under the operations of\naddition and subtraction forms an abelian (commutative) group; one\nthen passes to rings by bringing in multiplication, and further to\nfields with division. The common four-function calculator provides the\nfour functions of the field of reals.\n\nThe abstract concept of group in full generality is defined not in\nterms of a set of numbers but rather as an arbitrary set equipped with\na binary operation \\(xy\\), a unary inverse \\(x^{-1}\\) of that\noperation, and a unit \\(e\\) satisfying certain equations\ncharacteristic of groups. One striking novelty with groups not\nencountered in everyday elementary algebra is that their\nmultiplication need not be abelian: \\(xy\\) and \\(yx\\) can be\ndifferent! For example the group \\(S_3\\) of the six possible\npermutations of three things is not abelian, as can be seen by\nexchanging adjacent pairs of letters in the word dan. If you\nexchange the two letters on the left before the two on the right you\nget adn and then and, but if you perform these\nexchanges in the other order you get dna and then\nnda instead of and. Likewise the group of\n43,252,003,274,489,856,000 operations on Rubik\u2019s cube and the\ninfinite group \\(SO(3)\\) of rotations of the sphere are not abelian,\nthough the infinite group \\(SO(2)\\) of rotations of the circle is\nabelian. Quaternion multiplication and matrix multiplication is also\nnoncommutative. Abelian groups are often called additive groups and\ntheir group operation is referred to as addition \\(x+y\\) rather than\nmultiplication \\(xy\\).\n\nGroups, rings and fields only scratch the surface of abstract algebra.\nVector spaces and more generally modules are restricted forms of rings\nin which the operands of multiplication are required to be a scalar\nand a vector. Monoids generalize groups by dropping inverse; for\nexample the natural numbers form a monoid but not a group for want of\nnegation. Boolean algebras abstract the algebra of sets. Lattices\ngeneralize Boolean algebras by dropping complement and the\ndistributivity laws.\n\nA number of branches of mathematics have found algebra such an\neffective tool that they have spawned algebraic subbranches. Algebraic\nlogic, algebraic number theory, and algebraic topology are all heavily\nstudied, while algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics have\nentire journals devoted to them.\n\nAlgebra is of philosophical interest for at least two reasons. From\nthe perspective of foundations of mathematics, algebra is strikingly\ndifferent from other branches of mathematics in both its domain\nindependence and its close affinity to formal logic. Furthermore the\ndichotomy between elementary and abstract algebra reflects a certain\nduality in reasoning that Descartes, the inventor of Cartesian\nDualism, would have appreciated, wherein the former deals with the\nreasoning process and the latter that which is reasoned about, as\nrespectively the mind and body of mathematics.\n\nAlgebra has also played a significant role in clarifying and\nhighlighting notions of logic, at the core of exact philosophy for\nmillennia. The first step away from the Aristotelian logic of\nsyllogisms towards a more algebraic form of logic was taken by Boole\nin an 1847 pamphlet and subsequently in a more detailed treatise,\nThe Laws of Thought, in 1854. The dichotomy between\nelementary algebra and modern algebra then started to appear in the\nsubsequent development of logic, with logicians strongly divided\nbetween the formalistic approach as espoused by Frege, Peano, and\nRussell, and the algebraic approach followed by C. S. Peirce,\nSchroeder, and Tarski.\n",
