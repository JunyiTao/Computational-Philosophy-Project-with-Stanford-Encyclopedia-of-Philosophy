    "preamble": "\n\n\nQuine\u2019s system of axiomatic set theory, NF, takes its name from the\ntitle (\u201cNew Foundations for Mathematical Logic\u201d) of the\n1937 article which introduced it (Quine [1937a]). The axioms of NF are\nextensionality:\n \n\\[\n\\forall x\\forall y[x=y \\leftrightarrow \\forall z(z \\in x \\leftrightarrow z \\in y)] \n\\]\n\n\ntogether with stratified comprehension, which is to say all\nuniversal closures of formul\u00e6 like\n\n\\[\n\\exists x\\forall y(y \\in x \\leftrightarrow \\Phi)\n\\]\n\n\n where \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 is not free in \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) is\n(weakly) stratified. This last condition requires that there should be\na function \\(\\sigma\\) (a \u201cstratification\u201d) from\nthe bound variables in \\(\\Phi\\) to an initial segment\nof the natural numbers such that if \u2018\\(u \\in v\\)\u2019 is a\nsubformula of \\(\\Phi\\) then \\(\\sigma(`v\\rsquo) = \\sigma(`u\\rsquo) +\n1\\) and if \\(`u = v\\rsquo\\) is a subformula of \\(\\Phi\\) then\n\\(\\sigma(`v\\rsquo) = \\sigma(`u\\rsquo)\\). The origins of this\nconstraint will be explained below.\n\n\nSome illustrations may help: \\(x \\in x\\) is not stratified. \\(x \\in\ny\\) is. Thus not every substitution-instance of a stratified formula\nis stratified.  \\(y = \\wp(x)\\) is stratified (the fancy P means power\nset), with the variable \\(y\\) being given a type one higher than the\ntype given to \\(x\\). To check this we have to write out \u2018\\(y =\n\\wp(x)\\)\u2019 in primitive notation. (In primitive notation, this\nformula becomes: \\(\\forall z(z \\in y \\leftrightarrow \\forall w(w \\in z\n\\rightarrow w \\in x))\\). One can assign 0 to \\(w, 1\\) to \\(z\\),\nand 2 to \\(x\\), to get a stratification of this formula.) In general\nit is always necessary to write a formula out in primitive\nnotation \u2013 at least until one gets the hang of it.\n\n\nThe observant reader will have spotted the appearance above of the\nexpression weakly stratified. What is this? The instance of\nthe comprehension that says that \\(x \\cup \\{y\\}\\) always exists is\nstratified, and is therefore an axiom. So \\(x \\cup \\{y\\}\\) always\nexists. So \\(x \\cup \\{x\\}\\) always exists, by substitution. However\nthe instance of the comprehension scheme alleging its existence is not\nstratified. The term \u2018\\(x \\cup \\{x\\}\\)\u2019 is said to\nbe weakly stratified by which it is meant that it can be\nstratified if we are allowed to give different types to distinct\noccurrences of\nfree variables. Weak stratification is what is needed to\nadmit ab initio those instances of the comprehension scheme\nthat give us substitution instances of stratified instances, and not\nrequire a detour such as the detour here through the\nexistence of \\(x \\cup \\{y\\}\\).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Roots of Set Theory\n\n\nThere are various forces that gave rise to set theory, and various\nforces that sustain it and drive it on. The following two conceptions\nof set overlap but do not entirely coincide.\n\nThe notion of arbitrary set grew in the late 19th century\nfrom developments in analysis, somewhat in the way that the concept of\narbitrary real-valued function had grown earlier in the century. To\nthis day there are people who feel that the centre ground of set\ntheory lies in Analysis.\nA second idea is that of sets as one extensional (in the sense\nof the intension/extension distinction) limb (the others being lists\nand multisets) of a body whose intensional limbs are\nfunction-in-intension, properties, algorithm. (Sets as\nproperties-in-extension is not a completely straightforward story: the\npoint has been made that much of the heartsearching occasioned by the\nemergence of the Axiom of Choice as a principle of set existence arose\nprecisely because sometimes the sets it postulated seemed not to be the\nextension of any property. But this is to make the same point in a\nback-handed way: it shows that people were expecting sets to be\nextensions of known intensions.)\n\n\n\nIf we think of sets as extensions, what are the corresponding\nintensions? The answer must surely be: one-place predicates. (Solace\nfor the distractible: \u201cSo what are the extensions corresponding to\nmany-place predicates?\u201d The answer is not to worry; whatever you\nthink they ought to be, you can fake them with ordered tuples and\nsets).\n\n\nFrom our point of view, this is an interesting analysis, because on\nthis account of set, we clearly ought to believe in an axiom of\ncomplementation for sets. If you think that a negation of a proposition\nis a proposition (so that in particular a negation of an atomic\nproposition is a proposition) then you also believe that a negation (or\ncomplement or whatever you want to call it) of a predicate is another\npredicate. Notice that this doesn\u2019t tell you that your complementation\nhas to be classical, but it does tell you that a complement of a set\nshould be a set. This will turn out to be one of the axioms of NF.\n\n\nSets are just extensional entities with particular multiplicity\nproperties (that mark them off from multisets) and certain\nfunctionalities (that mark them off from functions-in-extension, graphs\netc). Among the variety of objects in the extensional canon, sets are\ndistinguished by their almost complete absence of structure. This\npoints to one of the most perplexing but prominent r\u00f4les of set\ntheory in modern mathematics. Almost any (indeed many people believe\nliterally any) fact in mathematics can be construed as a fact\nabout sets.\n\n\nThe idea that sets are extensions manifests itself in the idea (to\nwhich we will return) that set theory is the theory of one binary\nextensional relation (parallel to graph theory as the theory of a\nsingle symmetric irreflexive relation). Useful though this idea will\nturn out to be, it does not suggest any particular axioms for Set\ntheory.\n\n\nAxioms of set theory have arisen in part out of our understanding of the\nparadoxes. The most striking feature of the paradoxes is something\nvulgarly called \u201cself-reference\u201d, and ideas about how to\ndeal with it have been a useful constraint on our invention of axioms\nfor set theory. The search for a spell to ward off the evils attendant\nupon self-reference has fed into the axiomatisation of set theory in\ntwo ways, corresponding to the two ways in which self-reference has\nbeen (mis)-understood. Is it circularity in the specification\nof sets that is to be eschewed? Or do we locate the problem in\ncircularity in the membership relation between sets? At all\nevents, we have to be careful to keep to a minimum the number of\nsinews we cut, for there are important theorems (G\u00f6del\u2019s\nIncompleteness theorem among others) whose proofs rely on the same\n\u201cself-reference\u201d that we find in the paradoxes but which\nwe are loath to abandon.\n2. Wellfoundedness and ZF\n\n\nThe axioms of ZF are motivated by the second point of view \u2013 in\nfact by a very specific school of it: the view that the key is not\nmere noncircularity of \\(\\in\\) but wellfoundedness.\nA set \\(x\\) is wellfounded if there are no infinite sequences\n\\(\\ldots x_n \\in x_{n-1} \\in \\ldots x_3 \\in x_2 \\in x_1\\). The axioms\nof ZF can usefully be thought of as arising from an attempt to\naxiomatise the theory of wellfounded sets.  This project has been so\nsuccessful that nowadays many people believe that wellfounded sets are\nthe only kind of set there is \u2013 if it isn\u2019t wellfounded it\nisn\u2019t a set but a hyperset perhaps. This idea is a\nmodern rewriting of history: Set theory did not\nstart with the idea that all sets should be wellfounded (had\nit done so, the axiom scheme of na\u00efve comprehension would never\nhave been entertained!) The idea that we should admit a candidate set\nas a genuine set only if promises to be wellfounded is an overreaction\nto the uncontroversial observation that the suspect collections that\nfeature in the paradoxes (the universe, the Russell class) are all\nflagrantly illfounded, or at least would be if they existed. It is\neasy to jump from this insight to the conclusion that wellfoundedness\nof \\(\\in\\) is the only thing that matters. The result of this jump is\nZF set theory.\n\n\nBut historically-wrong and philosophically-hasty does not imply\nunproductive. There is no doubt that restricting attention to\nwellfounded sets (in the sense that it is them alone that one tries to\naxiomatise) concentrated the minds of 20th century mathematicians to\ngreat effect. ZF does seem to avoid the paradoxes, and the conception\nof set it formalises is one that apparently allows one to interpret the\nwhole of mathematics. But how can an historically wrong and\nphilosophically hasty story have such a happy ending? The answer is\nthat, although it may be a mistake to think that all sets are\nwellfounded, it is not a mistake to think that the concept of\nwellfounded set is worth axiomatising.\n3. Type Theory and the Axiomatisation of NF\n\n\nThe conception of set underlying NF arises from a related \u2013 indeed\ncomplementary \u2013 oversimplification. ZF arises from the belief that\nif we enforce a kind of wellfoundedness in the constitution of set\nthen all will be well. NF arises ultimately from the idea that all\nwill be well if we enforce a kind of wellfoundedness (or at least\nnoncircularity) in the description of sets. This concern can\ntake two forms: One might feel uneasy about conjuring up a set by\nmeans of a spell that invokes other sets that are in some sense\n\u201cnot yet\u201d available (sets of which the candidate will turn\nout to be a member, for example). This is a mathematically fruitful\nconcern (keyword \u201cpredicativity\u201d) and it will reappear\nlater in the study of NF (and in ZF too, of course) but it is not this\nfirst form that gives rise to the axiomatisation of NF. In the second\nview, the key to neutralising the dangers of self-reference lies in\nsegregating sets into pairwise disjoint levels called\ntypes. (That this concern is orthogonal to the first kind of\nconcern can be shown by consideration of the axiom of sumset. This is\na legitimate axiom from the second point of view, even though the\nspell that conjures \\(\\bigcup X\\) does it by invoking the set \\(X\\),\nwhich is of higher type.)\n\n\nThis view of set theory gave rise to the Theory of Types. In the\nTheory of Types (as simplified successively by Ramsey, Carnap,\nG\u00f6del and Quine) the bottom type is a collection of atoms. Atoms\nare non-sets (dormice, teapots, anything you please) with no internal\nstructure visible to the set theory. Thereafter type \\(n + 1\\) is\nsimply the power set of type \\(n\\), and there is a type for each\nnatural number. The process cannot be extended to give transfinite\ntypes, since the types (being formally disjoint) are not cumulative so\nthere is no sensible way to define a \\(\\omega\\)th type. NF arises from\na consideration of the syntax used to describe structures of this\nkind, and the syntax requires more careful handling. A first-order\nlanguage for describing structures of this sort has infinitely many\nsuites of variables, one suite for each type, and a membership symbol\n(\u2018\\(\\in\\)\u2019 as usual) which can be placed only between\nvariables of consecutive types: \u2018\\(x_n \\in y_{n+1}\\)\u2019 is\nwellformed but \u2018\\(x_n \\in y_n\\)\u2019 is not. The equality sign\ncan be placed only between variables of the same type.\n\n\nThis type theory has the following axioms. Extensionality at each\ntype:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x_n \\forall y_n [x_n =y_n \\leftrightarrow \\forall z_{n+1}(x_n \\in z_{n+1} \\leftrightarrow y_n \\in z_{n+1})]\n\\]\n\n\n and an axiom scheme of comprehension at each type. Notice that the\nformula displayed above is not, strictly speaking, an axiom of\nextensionality, since the variables do not have concrete type\nsubscripts, so it is not officially a formula at all. It\u2019s a kind of\naxiom scheme. Annoyingly, this subtlety matters. The fact that\nvariables have type subscripts precludes the more usual exploitations\nof subscripting for purposes such as indicating position in a\nsequence. This makes the language of type theory infeasible for most\nmathematical purposes, so one looks for excuses to omit the type\nsubscripts. Why might this be a safe man\u0153uvre? Let us define\n\\(\\Phi^+\\) to be the result of raising all the type subscripts\non all variables in \\(\\Phi\\). It\u2019s safe because the theory has the same\naxioms at each type, so it has the same theorems at each type, so\nwhenever one has a proof of a formula \\(\\Phi\\) one also has a proof of\n\\(\\Phi^+\\). One omits the type subscripts because even though,\nonce has omitted them, there are infinitely many ways of restoring\nthem, these infinitely many differently restored versions do not\nappear to differ significantly. We shall take up later the theme of\nthe significance of this difference, but for the moment we note only\nthat it appears \u2013 as it appeared to Russell and his successors up\nto and including Quine \u2013 that the differences could be safely\noverlooked. This strategy of overlooking is called typical\nambiguity.\n\n\nThis version of Type theory, as simplified by Ramsey, G\u00f6del,\nCarnap and Quine. is the point of departure for Quine [1937a] (which\nis still a good place to read the background). NF is obtained from\nthis type theory by taking its axioms and stripping the type\nsubscripts off all the variables. This is subtly different from Type\nTheory used with a policy of typical ambiguity. Under that scheme a\nformula like \n\n\\[\\tag{A}\n\\exists x\\forall y(y \\in x)\n\\]\n\n\n isn\u2019t really a formula at all, but a formula scheme, or shorthand for\nany of the genuine formul\u00e6 to be obtained from it by adding\nsubscripts to \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(y\\)\u2019. Which subscript? In every setting it will\neither (i) become clear which subscript, or (ii) become clear that it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. At all events, (A) is not an axiom of Type theory: the\ntheory does not have a universal set, what it has is a universal set\nat each type.\n\n\nHowever it is not just the universal set that appears at each type.\nWe also get the naturals, the reals and the rationals etc. etc. at\neach type, and this is clearly not what we want. (Holmes refers to\nthis as the Hall of Mirrors effect.) Quine\u2019s move in\n[1937a] is the natural one of taking the pseudoformul\u00e6 like (A)\nand thinking of them as genuine formul\u00e6 in a new, one-sorted,\nlanguage. The new theory does not have a universal set at each type,\nfor it has no types: it has a single universal set. And a single\nimplementation of the reals, and so on. Formul\u00e6 of the\none-sorted language obtained in this way from formul\u00e6 of type\ntheory are said to be stratified. The axioms of NF are now\nextensionality plus those instances of na\u00efve comprehension that\nhappen to be stratified.\n\n\nInterestingly, natural and well-motivated though this progression\nsounds, it does not provide a consistency proof for the system it ends\nwith. We will discuss this later.\n\n\nThe hard part is to fully understand stratification. There is an easy\nrule of thumb with formul\u00e6 that are in primitive notation, for\none can just ask oneself whether the formula could become a wff of\ntype theory by adding type indices. It\u2019s harder when one has\nformul\u00e6 no longer in primitive notation, and the reader\nencounters these difficulties very early on, since the ordered pair is\nnot a set-theoretic notion. How does one determine whether or not a\nformula is stratified when it contains subformul\u00e6 like \\(f(x) =\ny\\)? The technical/notational difficulty here lands on top of \u2013 as\nso often \u2013 a conceptual difficulty. The answer is that of course\none has to fix an implementation of ordered pair and stick to it. Does\nthat mean that \u2013 for formul\u00e6 involving ordered\npairs \u2013 whether or not the given formula is stratified depends on\nhow one implements ordered pairs? The answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but\nthe situation is not as grave as this suggests. There are various\nstandard definitions of ordered pair, and they are all legitimate in\nNF, and all satisfactory in the sense that they are\n\u201clevel\u201d or homogeneous. All of them make the\nformula \u201c\\(\\langle x, y\\rangle = z\\)\u201d stratified and give\nthe variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) the same type; \\(z\\) takes a higher type\nin most cases (never lower). How much higher depends on the\nversion of ordered pair being used, but there are very few\nformul\u00e6 that come out stratified on one version of ordered pair\nbut unstratified on another, and they are all pathological in ways\nreminiscent of the paradoxes.\n\n The best way to illustrate this is by considering ordinals \\((=\\)\nisomorphism classes of wellorderings) in NF. For any ordinal \\(\\alpha\\)\nthe order type of the set (and it is a set) of the ordinals below\n\\(\\alpha\\) is wellordered. In ZF one can prove that the wellordering of\nthe ordinals below \\(\\alpha\\) is of length \\(\\alpha\\). In NF one cannot\nprove this equation for arbitrary \\(\\alpha\\) since the formula in the set\nabstract whose extension is the graph of the isomorphism is not\nstratified for any implementation of ordered pair. Now any\nwellordering \\(R\\) of a set \\(A\\) to length \\(\\alpha\\) gives\nrise to a wellordering of \\(\\{\\{\\{a\\}\\} : a \\in A\\}\\), and if instead one tries to prove (in NF) that the\nordinals below \\(\\alpha\\) are isomorphic to the wellordering of length\n\\(\\alpha\\) decorated with curly brackets, one finds that the very\nassertion that there is an isomorphism between these two wellorderings\ncomes out stratified or unstratified depending on one\u2019s choice of\nimplementation of ordered pair! This is because, in some sense, the\napplications of the pairing function are two deep in\nwellordering of the ordinals below \\(\\alpha\\), but only one deep\nin the wellordering of the set of double singletons. If we use Quine\nordered pairs, the assertion is stratified \u2013 and provable. If one\nuses Wiener-Kuratowski ordered pairs then the assertion is\nunstratified and refutable. However if one uses Wiener-Kuratowki\nordered pairs there is instead the assertion that the ordinals below\n\\(\\alpha\\) are isomorphic to the obvious wellordering of\n\\(\\{\\{\\{\\{\\{a\\}\\}\\}\\} : a \\in A\\}\\), which comes out\nstratified (and provable). In general for each implementation of\nordered pair there is a depth of nesting of curly brackets which will\nmake a version of this equality come out stratified and true. This\ndoes not work with deviant implementations of ordered pair under\nwhich \u201c\\(\\langle x, y\\rangle = z\\)\u201d is\nunstratified or even with those which are stratified but give the\nvariables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) different types. Use of such\nimplementations of ordered pairs results in certain sets not being the\nsame size as themselves!\n\n\nPerhaps a concrete example would help. Let us try to prove\nCantor\u2019s theorem. The key step in showing there is no surjection\n\\(f : X \\to \\wp(X)\\) by reductio ad absurdum is the\nconstruction of the diagonal set \\(\\{x \\in X : x \\not\\in f(x)\\}\\). \nThe proof relies on this object being a set, which it will be\na set if \u201c\\(x \\in X \\amp x \\not\\in f(x) \\amp f : X \\rightarrow\n\\wp(X)\\)\u201d is stratified. This in turn depends on\n\u201c\\(\\exists y[y \\in \\wp(X) \\amp \\langle y, x\\rangle \\in f \\amp f : X\n\\rightarrow \\wp(X)]\\)\u201d being stratified. And\nit isn\u2019t stratified, because \u201c\\(\\langle y, x\\rangle \\in\nf\\)\u201d compels \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 to be\ngiven the same type, while \u201c\\(f : X \\rightarrow \\wp(X)\\)\u201d\nwill compel \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 to be given a type one higher than\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019. This is because we have subformul\u00e6\n\u2018\\(x \\in X\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(y \\subseteq X\\)\u2019. Notice\nthat we can draw this melancholy conclusion without knowing whether\nthe type of \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 is one higher than that type of its\nargument, or two, or three \u2026. We cannot prove Cantor\u2019s\ntheorem.\n \n\nHowever if we try instead to prove that \\(\\{\\{x\\} : x \\in X\\}\\) is not\nthe same size as \\(\\wp(X)\\) we find that the diagonal set is defined\nby a stratified condition and exists, so the proof succeeds. This\ntells us that we cannot prove that \\(\\lvert X\\rvert = \\lvert \\{\\{x\\} :\nx \\in X\\}\\rvert\\) for arbitrary \\(X\\): graphs of restrictions of the\nsingleton function tend not to exist. If they did, we would be able to\nprove Cantor\u2019s theorem in full generality. This gives rise to an\nendomorphism \\(T\\) on cardinals, where \\(T\\lvert X\\rvert =_{df} \\lvert\n\\{\\{x\\} : x \\in X\\}\\rvert\\). \\(T\\) misbehaves in connection with the\nsets that in NF studies we call big (as opposed\nto large, as in large cardinals (in ZF)). These are\nthe collections like the universal set, and the set of all cardinals\nand the set of all ordinals: collections denoted by expressions which\nin ZF-like theories will pick out proper classes. If \\(\\lvert X\\rvert\n= \\lvert \\{\\{x\\} : x \\in X\\}\\rvert\\) we say that \\(X\\)\nis cantorian. If the singleton function restricted to \\(X\\)\nexists, we say that \\(X\\) is strongly cantorian. Sets whose\nsizes are concrete natural numbers are strongly cantorian. IN (the set\nof Frege natural numbers) is cantorian, but the assertion that it is\nstrongly cantorian implies the consistency of NF.\n\n\nIt can be plausibly argued that the bizarre behaviour of the\n\\(T\\) function (and it is at its most bizarre in connection with\nthe big sets) is just the paradoxes bubbling up again. Assertions to\nthe effect that \\(T\\) is well-behaved have strong consistency\nstrength (Orey [1955], [1956]) and play in NF studies the kind of\nr\u00f4le that large cardinal axioms play in ZF-like systems. Indeed\nthere are some exact equivalents. The \\(T\\)-assertions may look\nodd, but their oddness is only skin-deep. They are actually expressing\nthe same mathematics that happens in ZF, but through an unfamiliar\nformalisation.\n4. History\n\n\nIn the early years of NF studies (1937\u20131952) it was not known whether\nor not NF proved the axiom of infinity. Specker showed that it did,\nthough he never published his proof: the (quite different) proof in\nSpecker [1953] is of his stronger result that NF proves that the\nuniverse cannot be wellordered (and is therefore infinite) and the\nfirst published proof is in Henson [1973a])\n\n\nSo NF refutes AC. However \u2013 so far \u2013 it seems that (apart from\nsome weird weak formulations that make no sense outside an NF context\nand which all arise from refinements of Specker\u2019s proof) it is only\nfull AC that fails, so that some strong consequences of AC\nremain on the cards for the moment. In particular, no-one has refuted\nthe prime ideal theorem or countable choice or DC. Further, it is\nstriking that all known failures of AC involve big sets. An axiom\nsaying that all wellfounded sets are wellordered might \u2013 for all\nwe know \u2013 be consistent with NF. In particular there is no reason\nto suppose that NF refutes the weak forms of AC needed in the study of\nthe reals and complexes (\u201cAnalysis\u201d). Indeed as far as we\nknow we can safely add to NF some axioms to say that the wellfounded\nsets form a model of ZFC. According to this view, NF does not so much\ncontradict ZFC as cover extra topics, such as the universal set\n \u2013  phenomena about which ZF has nothing to say. This underpins\nthe view held by both Church and Quine, albeit in different ways, that\na synthesis of ZFC and NF could be obtained along these lines.\n\n\nQuite early on Quine added classes to NF to obtain a theory of\nsets-with-classes known as ML. In the ZF context, adding classes is a\nnatural thing to do, for it enables one to reduce the infinite\nreplacement scheme to a single set-existence axiom: \u201cthe image\nof a set in a class is a set\u201d if augmented with suitable\nclass-existence axioms. However, none of the axioms of NF refer to\nclasses in the way the replacement scheme of ZF does, so there is\nnothing for the class existence axioms to do. For this reason ML is\nnowadays regarded as a pointless syntactic complication of NF with no\nnew mathematics, and it is not the subject of any research. At best\nthe classes can be a harmless halo of epiphenomena (Wang\n[1950]). However, at worst \u2013 if the set existence axioms are\nallowed to have bound class variables (as in the 1940 first edition of\nQuine [1951a]) \u2013 then the class of total orders that are genuinely\n(\u201cexternally\u201d) wellordered (no subclasses without\nleast members) becomes a set and we have the Burali-Forti paradox\n(Rosser [1942]). The rumours still occasionally surfacing among\nmathematicians of the inconsistency of NF probably have their origin\nin a misreporting of this result, but the result itself concerns ML\nonly so it has no bearing on the consistency question for NF. If NF is\ninconsistent it is for totally different reasons. There is recent\nwork suggesting that NF is consistent but it has not yet been\nconfirmed. A paper containing an alleged proof of Con(NF) is working\nits way through the refereeing process as this entry is being revised\nin 2018.\n\n\nIn [1944] Hailperin gave the first of a number of finite\naxiomatisations of NF now known. Many of them exploit the function \\(x\n\\mapsto \\{y : x \\in y\\}\\) which is injective and total and is an\n\\(\\in\\)-isomorphism. This function was known to Whitehead, who\nsuggested to Quine that \\(\\{y : x \\in y\\}\\) should be called the\n\u201cessence\u201d of \\(x\\) (a terminology clearly suggested by a\nview of sets as properties-in-extension).\n\n\nAnother early result was the observation of Rosser [1952] that NF\nadmitted a type-level ordered pair iff the axiom of infinity was a\ntheorem of NF. (see Forster [1994])\n\n\nThe second major development was Scott\u2019s [1962] application of\nRieger-Bernays independence methods to NF. If \\(\\langle X, E\\rangle\\)\nis a binary structure with \\(E\\) an extensional relation on \\(X\\) (so\nthat \\(\\langle X, E\\rangle\\) is a model of a set theory of some kind)\nand \\(\\pi\\) is a permutation of \\(X\\), then \\(\\{\\langle x,\n\\pi(y)\\rangle : \\langle x, y\\rangle \\in E\\}\\) is also an extensional\nrelation on \\(X\\) and gives us a new model of some kind of set\ntheory. If certain constraints are respected, this method outputs\nmodels of ZF when given models of ZF (and was first invented in order\nto prove the independence of the axiom of foundation from the other\naxioms of ZF) but it works even better with NF, since the construction\npreserves stratified formul\u00e6.\n\n\nThe third major development came when Specker (in [1958] and [1962])\nplaced the narrative in Quine [1937a] recounted above on a firm\nmathematical footing. (For an illustrated translation, with\ncommentary, of Specker [1958], see Forster [2000], in the Other\nInternet Resources section below.) We\u2019ve seen that \\(\\Phi^+\\)\nis the result of raising all the type subscripts on all variables in\n\\(\\Phi\\) by one. Then \\(\\Phi \\leftrightarrow \\Phi^+\\) is an axiom of\ntypical ambiguity. Specker established that the consistency of NF\nis equivalent to the consistency of TST + the scheme of all axioms of\ntypical ambiguity. This reduction of the consistency question of NF to\nthe consistency of TST + the axiom scheme of typical ambiguity\nclarifies matters but doesn\u2019t actually solve anything, since the\naxioms of typical ambiguity turn out to be quite strong \u2013 as are\ntheir analogues in other languages (such as geometry) that admit\nendomorphisms. Notice that the mere fact that if \\(\\phi\\) is provable\nthen so is \\(\\phi^+\\) is not enough to ensure that \\(\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi^+\\) is provable, so the axioms of typical ambiguity are\nprima facie nontrivial and we should not be surprised that\nthey turn out to be strong.\n\n\nKaye [1991] generalised Specker\u2019s method to show how any typed\ntheory of sets, garnished with the axioms of typical ambiguity, turns\nout to be equiconsistent with a one-sorted theory. Various weak\nfragments of NF can be shown consistent by this kind of\nanalysis. Oswald ([1976], [1981] and [1982]) introduced a notation\naccording to which \\(NF_n\\) is the system axiomatised by the\n\\(n\\)-stratified axioms of NF, and \\(N_n F\\) is extensionality\nplus the existence of \\(\\{x : \\phi(x)\\}\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is\n\\(n\\)-stratified (parameters are allowed). Oswald showed that\n\n\\[\nN_1 F \\subseteq NF_2 \\subseteq N_2 F \\subseteq NF_3 \\subseteq N_3 F = \\mathrm{NF}\n\\]\n\n\nand that the inclusions are all proper. The consistency of \\(NF_3\\) is\na result of Grishin [1969].\n\n\nCrabb\u00e9 [1982a] proved the consistency of two predicative\nfragments of NF: NFP and NFI. Both are extensionality plus existence\nof \\(\\{y : \\phi(y, x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\}\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is stratified\nand there are extra restrictions on the variables in \\(\\phi\\). All\nvariables (bound or free) are restricted to type no higher than that\nof the set being defined; bound variable are not to be of any type\nexceeding the type of \\(y\\) (NFP) or (type of \\(y) + 1\\) (NFI). NFP +\nAxiom of sumset = NF. They are distinguished from the other subsystems\nof NF known to be consistent by the circumstance that they allow a\nproof of the axiom of infinity which makes essential use of\nSpecker\u2019s proof of the axiom of infinity. In NFP we argue:\neither the axiom of sumset holds, in which case we have NF and can run\nSpecker\u2019s proof of the Axiom of infinity, or (ii) it\ndoesn\u2019t, in which case \u2013 since finite sets have\nsumsets \u2013 not every set is finite.\n\n\nThe most dramatic result obtained by a\ntype-theory-plus-ambiguity-axiom analysis came when Ronald Jensen\n[1969] noticed that if we weaken TST to a theory called TSTU by\nallowing the existence of urelemente (distinct empty sets)\nthen it is easy to prove the consistency of the axioms of typical\nambiguity. The result is a model of NFU, which is NF with\nextensionality weakened to allow urelemente. Jensen referred\nto NFU as \u201cslight(?) modification of Quine\u2019s NF\u201d,\nbut \u2013 as he showed \u2013 the modification has huge effects:\nSpecker\u2019s proof of the axiom of infinity no longer works, and AC is\nnot refutable either.\n \n\nJensen\u2019s consistency proof for TSTU (and thereby NFU) combines Ramsey\ntheory with a technique that had been developed originally by Abraham\nRobinson [1939] to obtain a proof of the independence of\nextensionality from the other axioms of ZF.\n\n\nBoffa [1988] noticed another consistency proof of NFU. If\n\\(\\langle V, \\in \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(Z\\) (Zermelo set\ntheory) with an external automorphism \\(\\sigma\\) and an ordinal \\(\\kappa\\)\nsuch that \\(\\kappa \\rangle \\sigma(\\kappa)\\), then\n\\(V_{\\kappa}\\) is the domain of a model of NFU\nwhose membership relation is\n\n\\[\n\\{\\langle x, y\\rangle : \\sigma(x) \\in y \\amp \\varrho(y) \\le \\sigma(\\kappa) + 1\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\((\\varrho\\) is set-theoretic rank.) Remarkably, as Holmes showed, one can\neven recover from this model of NFU the nonstandard model of ZF that\ngave rise to it. He does this by exploiting the idea of set pictures.\nWe saw earlier the idea that set theory is the theory of one\nextensional binary relation (with equality of course: extensionality\ncannot be defined in a language without equality). Thus one could say\nthat a set (or, better, a set picture) is a isomorphism class\nof binary structures consisting of a domain, an extensional binary\nrelation, and a designated element of the carrier set. Relational\nstructures of this kind look like transitive closures of sets and the\ndesignated element of the domain indicates the set whose transitive\nclosure is being depicted. (Consequently there is an accessibility\ncondition for the designated element: if one thinks of the extensional\nrelation as a graph, there must be a directed path from any element to\nthe designated element).\n\n\nAlthough it was Aczel\u2019s [1988] book that made the idea of Accessible Pointed Graph common\ncurrency, the idea goes back at least to Hinnion\u2019s Ph.D. thesis [1974]\nand in a less developed form to Specker\u2019s (unpublished)\nHabilitationsschrift and quite possibly earlier. Aczel used\nthis technique to provide models of Forti-Honsell\u2019s antifoundation\naxiom [1983]; Hinnion\u2019s idea was to use isomorphism classes of\nwellfounded pointed extensional relational types to interpret\ntheories of wellfounded sets in NF. With wellfounded extensional\nrelations one does not need to make the pointing explicit, since the\nwellfoundedness ensures that at most one element of the carrier set\ncan satisfy the accessibility condition. (This is not so in general:\nthe two sets \\(x = \\{y\\}\\); \\(y = \\{x, \\varnothing \\}\\) have set pictures that have the same binary\nrelation but different pointing.) In NFU each set picture is a set (a\nbig set, as it happens) and Holmes showed that in a model arising\n\u00e0 la Boffa the set pictures reproduce the sets of the\noriginal nonstandard model. This striking phenomenon \u2013 which has\nno parallel in the study of NF \u2013 justifies Holmes\u2019 dictum that\n\u201cNFU can be understood as the theory of certain nonstandard\nmodels of Zermelo-style set theory with automorphisms.\u201d\n\n\nThere is a widespread misapprehension that Cantor\u2019s theorem shows\nthat there cannot be a consistent set theory with a universal set. That\nerror can be refuted by Jensen\u2019s construction of his models for NFU,\nbut by far the most appealing demonstration is a later construction of\na model of a set theory with a universal set by Church and Oswald\nindependently and roughly simultaneously in the early 1970s. It has the advantage over NFU\nof respecting extensionality: it is a genuine model of a theory of pure\nsets. The construction is a refinement of Rieger-Bernays methods. It\ngoes as follows: start with a model of something like ZF, and a\nbijection \\(k\\) between \\(V\\) and \\(V \\times \\{0, 1\\}\\). We\nnow define a new membership relation \\(E\\) so that \\(xEy\\)\niff either the second component of \\(k(y)\\) is 1 and\n\\(x \\in\\) first component, or the second component of\n\\(k(y)\\) is 0 and \\(x \\not\\in\\) first component.\n\\(k^{-1}(\\varnothing)\\) is now the universal set. In fact\n \\(k^{-1}(\\langle x,0\\rangle)\\) and\n \\(k^{-1}(\\langle x,1\\rangle)\\) are\nset-complements in this new structure.\n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, given that constructions like this provide\ncomplements for all sets, they give a central r\u00f4le to the concept\nof wellfounded set in that the wellfounded sets of the new\nmodel can be made to be an isomorphic copy of the wellfounded sets in\nthe structure one starts with. Further, these models satisfy a scheme\nof replacement for wellfounded sets: anything the same size as a\nwellfounded set is a set. (Replacement for, say, wellordered sets\ndoesn\u2019t come free in the same way)\n5. Other Current Research Areas\n\n\nZF arose as an attempt to axiomatise the theory of wellfounded sets,\nand this principle is kept constantly in mind by the ZF-istes as they\nstruggle to find new and more informative axioms. In contrast, the\nsyntactic version of the noncircularity insight (which is the one that\nunderlies NF) has been a much less fertile source of axioms for its\noffspring. Most new axioms for NF are either versions of AC or\npostulates of smooth behaviour by the \\(T\\) functions. It may be\nmore natural to compare/contrast NF with Zermelo set theory rather\nthan with ZF(C); Zermelo was a first attempt at formalising a theory\nof sets-of-ordinary-mathematics; it took a few decades for it to\nbecome clear that the pack of axioms needed the axiom scheme of\nreplacement, and it could be argued that NF should be analogously\naugmented with axioms such as the axiom of counting (which says that\nthe singleton function restricted to the natural numbers is a set), or\nwith the axiom of choice for wellfounded sets.\nNF and Proof Theory\n\n The proof theory of stratified formul\u00e6 is intriguing but\nfrustratingly little work has been done on\nit. The sentence\n\n\\[\n\\forall x[\\forall y(y \\in x \\rightarrow \\forall z(z \\in y) \\rightarrow \\bot)\n\\rightarrow \\forall z(z \\in x) \\rightarrow \\bot]\n\\]\n\n\n is an example of a stratified theorem of first-order logic that has\nstratified proofs but no stratified cut-free proofs. Crabb\u00e9\n[1991], [1994] has given two proofs of the fact that SF (NF with\nextensionality dropped altogether) admits cut-elimination. The\nconnections with type theory make constructive versions of NF an\nobvious target for investigation, but nothing publishable has emerged\nso far. The only known proof (Specker\u2019s) of the axiom of infinity in\nNF has too little constructive content to allow a demonstration that\nINF (NF with a constructive instead of classical ambient logic) admits\nan implementation of Heyting arithmetic, but opinion is divided on\nwhether or not this tells us that INF is significantly weaker than NF.\n\n6. Implementation of Mathematical Concepts in NF\n\n\nTo the extent that mathematical concepts can be implemented in the\ntheory of wellfounded sets (aka ZF) they can also be\ninterpreted in NF \u2013 since NF has a theory of wellfounded\nsets. However this is not the way in which we routinely interpret\nmathematics in NF since the interpreting formul\u00e6 are\nunstratified and unwieldy: extra axioms are needed. For example, the\nVon Neumann implementation of natural numbers tries to tell us that\nthe collection of natural numbers is not the extension of a stratified\nformula, so it cannot be expected to be a set. By the same token,\nordinary functions from the naturals to the naturals can fail to have\nextensions that are sets. Instead we trade on the fact that NF (and\nNFU too) admits a natural implementation of various kinds of\nmathematical entities as global isomorphism classes \u2013 which will\nof course be big sets (qv). The natural number \\(n\\) is\nimplemented as the set of all \\(n\\)-membered sets: this is the\nFrege implementation used also in TST. Rosser [1953a] uses NF instead\nof ZF as a foundation for presenting ordinary mathematics (and to this\nday remains the only book to do so, though Holmes [1998] uses NFU for\nthis purpose).\n\n\nAs we have seen, implementing mathematical objects (ZF-style) as\nwellfounded sets and then reasoning about those wellfounded sets) is\nnot a very satisfactory way to proceed, since NF does not have\nsufficient strength for us to manipulate the implemented objects with\nthe freedom we want. The situation with the endogenous interpretation\n(mathematical objects as global equivalence classes) is potentially\nmore satisfactory. In this scenario cardinals are implemented as\nequivalence classes under equipollence and are (big) sets. The\ncollection of all cardinals is a set. Ordinals can be handled\nsimilarly: ordinals are (big) sets and the collection of all ordinals\nis a (big) set; the collection of all groups is a set, the collection\nof all rings is a set; \u2026. Being big, these sets cannot be\nmanipulated in the freewheeling way that small sets can be. (The axiom\nof scheme of (full, unstratified) separation fails for big sets: if it\ndidn\u2019t then the Russell class would be \\(\\{x \\in V: x \\not\\in\nx\\})\\) and their manipulation is complicated by the appearance on the\nscene of various analogues of the \\(T\\) function (that we saw in\nconnection with the cardinals) that are needed to work round the\nstratification constraints. However, it is most striking that this\ndoesn\u2019t turn out to be much of a problem. On the whole, ordinary\nmathematics seems to be what the Computer Scientists call strongly\ntyped, and to a large extent the stratification constraints of NF\ncoincide with the endogenous strong typing of the mathematical objects\nbeing implemented. Sadly there is no space here for a proper\ndiscussion of this deep and interesting question.\n\n\nHowever, the expression \u201cOrdinary mathematics\u201d is disputed\nturf. On another front there are logicians that are fond of making\nthe point that some of the further reaches of large cardinal theory,\nroutinely disregarded \u2013 and even disparaged \u2013 by many\nmathematicians nevertheless have implications for a kind of low-level\nmathematics whose core significance is not in dispute. Inevitably the\nquestion of the adequacy of NF for \u201cOrdinary mathematics\u201d\nwill overlap with this debate. However there is a further\ncomplication to be considered. All these big collections that\nimplement the collection of all cardinals (or of all ordinals etc.)\nare nevertheless sets, so there are questions arising from their\nsethood that we can ask about them, and some of these questions have\nno parallel in ZF. What is the cofinality of the wellordering of the\nordinals? Can we map onto \\(V\\) the set of those sets that do\nnot map onto \\(V\\)? No doubt there will be people who say that\nthese questions are not proper mathematical questions at all, but are\nmere pathological artefacts of a misconceived system of axioms.\nHowever, there is the intriguing possibility that answers to these\nquestions could have implications for the study of the kind of small\nsets that appear in \u201cordinary mathematics\u201d. No such\nimplications have been found so far, but then no-one has looked very\nhard. We know of subclasses of the naturals definable by formul\u00e6\nthat have big sets as parameters, so we know where to start looking.\nIt is tempting to speculate what the consequences might be for NF\nstudies were any to be discovered.\n7. Coda\n\n\nThe current status of NF studies is odd. In the 1970s Boffa and Coret\nproved some interesting results about stratified formul\u00e6 in\ntheories of wellfounded sets, and work continues. However there is\nlittle traffic in the other direction and it seems unlikely that NF\nwill attract the attention of a critical mass of scholars until\nsomeone succeeds in proving it consistent relative to ZF or one of its\nkin, (and even this is uncertain, for NFU is known to be consistent\nand still finds few friends) and this consistency question seems to be\nvery hard. There are older unresolved issues in Set Theory \u2013 CH\nfor one \u2013 but the status of NF does seem to be the oldest\noutstanding consistency question. The fact that NF refutes\nthe axiom of choice sharpens the consistency problem greatly, and\nought to sharpen public interest, but the widely-held view that sets\nare, of their essence, wellfounded represents a huge rhetorical\nobstacle to NF attracting the attention that its foundational interest\nmerits. That idea is now (post Aczel [1988]) less suffocating than it\nwas, but is still casts a shadow. The shadow it casts falls over NFU\nas well, which is unfortunate, since NFU is known to be consistent,\nand has a wealth of interesting model theory. It also distracts us\nfrom the most basic feature of NF: as a theory of a universal set, it\ndoes at least represent an earnest endeavour to take the paradoxical\nclasses seriously, and not just erase them. \u201cCowards, you\nnotice\u201d says Higgins in Pygmalion \u201care always shrieking to\nhave troublesome people killed\u201d.\n",
