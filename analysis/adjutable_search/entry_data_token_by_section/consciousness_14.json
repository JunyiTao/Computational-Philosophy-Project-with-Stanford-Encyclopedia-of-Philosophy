    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Dynamic flow\n4.8 Dynamic flow\n\n\nThe dynamics of consciousness are evident in the coherent\norder of its ever changing process of flow and self-transformation,\nwhat William James (1890) called the \u201cstream of\nconsciousness.\u201d Some temporal sequences of experience are\ngenerated by purely internal factors as when one thinks through a\npuzzle, and others depend in part upon external causes as when one\nchases a fly ball, but even the latter sequences are shaped in large\npart by how consciousness transforms itself.\n\n\nWhether partly in response to outer influences or entirely from\nwithin, each moment to moment sequence of experience grows coherently\nout of those that preceded it, constrained and enabled by the global\nstructure of links and limits embodied in its underlying prior\norganization (Husserl 1913). In that respect, consciousness is an\nautopoietic system, i.e., a self-creating and self-organizing system\n(Varela and Maturana 1980).\n\n\nAs a conscious mental agent I can do many things such as scan my\nroom, scan a mental image of it, review in memory the courses of a\nrecent restaurant meal along with many of its tastes and scents, reason\nmy way through a complex problem, or plan a grocery shopping trip and\nexecute that plan when I arrive at the market. These are all routine\nand common activities, but each involves the directed generation of\nexperiences in ways that manifest an implicit practical understanding\nof their intentional properties and interconnected contents (Van Gulick\n2000).\n\n\nConsciousness is a dynamic process, and thus an adequate descriptive\nanswer to the What question must deal with more than just its static or\nmomentary properties. In particular, it must give some account of the\ntemporal dynamics of consciousness and the ways in which its\nself-transforming flow reflects both its intentional coherence and the\nsemantic self-understanding embodied in the organized controls through\nwhich conscious minds continually remake themselves as autopoietic\nsystems engaged with their worlds.\n\n\nA comprehensive descriptive account of consciousness would need to\ndeal with more than just these seven features, but having a clear\naccount of each of them would take us a long way toward answering the\n\u201cWhat is consciousness?\u201d question.\n",
