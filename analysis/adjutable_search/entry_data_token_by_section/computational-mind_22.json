    "main_text": "Arguments against computationalism || G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem\n7.2 G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem\n According to some authors, G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems show that human mathematical capacities outstrip the\ncapacities of any Turing machine (Nagel and Newman 1958). J.R. Lucas\n(1961) develops this position into a famous critique of CCTM. Roger Penrose\npursues the critique in The Emperor\u2019s New Mind (1989)\nand subsequent writings. Various philosophers and logicians have\nanswered the critique, arguing that existing formulations suffer from\nfallacies, question-begging assumptions, and even outright\nmathematical errors (Bowie 1982; Chalmers 1996b; Feferman 1996; Lewis 1969, 1979; Putnam\n1975: 365\u2013366, 1994; Shapiro 2003). There is a wide consensus\nthat this criticism of CCTM lacks any force. It may turn out that\ncertain human mental capacities outstrip Turing-computability, but\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems provide no reason to\nanticipate that outcome.\n",
