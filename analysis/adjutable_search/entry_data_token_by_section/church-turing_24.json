    "main_text": "The Case for the Church-Turing Thesis || Kripke\u2019s version of argument II\n4.5 Kripke\u2019s version of argument II\n\nA significant recent contribution to the area has been made by Kripke\n(2013). A conventional view of the status of the Church-Turing thesis\nis that, while \u201cvery considerable intuitive evidence\u201d has\namassed for the thesis, the thesis is \u201cnot a precise enough\nissue to be itself susceptible to mathematical treatment\u201d\n(Kripke 2013: 77). Kleene gave an early expression of this now\nconventional view:\n\n\nSince our original notion of effective calculability of a function\n\u2026 is a somewhat vague intuitive one, the thesis cannot be\nproved. \u2026 While we cannot prove Church\u2019s thesis, since\nits role is to delimit precisely an hitherto vaguely conceived\ntotality, we require evidence \u2026. (Kleene 1952: 318)\n\n\nRejecting the conventional view, Kripke suggests that, on the\ncontrary, the Church-Turing thesis is susceptible to mathematical\nproof. Furthermore, he canvasses the idea that Turing himself sketched\nan argument that serves to prove the thesis.\n\nKripke attempts to build a mathematical demonstration of the\nChurch-Turing thesis around Turing\u2019s argument II. He claims that\nhis demonstration is \u201cvery close\u201d to Turing\u2019s\n(Kripke 2013: 80). However, this is debatable, since, in its detail,\nthe Kripke argument differs considerably from argument II. But one can\nat least say that Kripke\u2019s argument was inspired by\nTuring\u2019s argument II, and belongs in Kleene\u2019s category\n\u201cD\u201d (along with II and Church\u2019s step-by-step\nargument).\n\nKripke argues that the Church-Turing thesis is a corollary of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem for first-order predicate\ncalculus with identity. Put somewhat crudely, the latter theorem\nstates that every valid deduction (couched in the language of\nfirst-order predicate calculus with identity) is provable in\nthe calculus. In other words, the deduction of \\(B\\) from premises\n\\(A_{1},\\) \\(A_{2},\\) \u2026 \\(A_{n}\\) (where statements \\(A_{1},\\)\n\\(A_{2},\\) \u2026 \\(A_{n},\\) \\(B\\) are all in the language of\nfirst-order predicate calculus with identity) is logically valid if\nand only if \\(B\\) can be proved from \\(A_{1},\\) \\(A_{2},\\) \u2026\n\\(A_{n}\\) in the calculus.\n\nThe first step of the Kripke argument is his claim that (error-free,\nhuman) computation is itself a form of deduction:\n\n\n[A] computation is a special form of mathematical argument. One is\ngiven a set of instructions, and the steps in the computation are\nsupposed to follow\u2014follow deductively\u2014from the\ninstructions as given. So a computation is just another\nmathematical deduction, albeit one of a very specialized form.\n(Kripke 2013: 80)\n\n\nThe following two-line program in pseudo-code illustrates\nKripke\u2019s claim. The symbol \u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d is read\n\u201cbecomes\u201d, and \u201c=\u201d as usual means identity.\nThe first instruction in the program is \\(r \\rightarrow 2\\). This\ntells the computer to place the value 2 in storage location \\(r\\)\n(assumed to be initially empty). The second instruction \\(r\n\\rightarrow r + 3\\) tells the computer to add 3 to the content of\n\\(r\\) and store the result in \\(r\\) (over-writing the previous content\nof \\(r\\)). The execution of this two-line program can be represented\nas a deduction:\n\n\n{Execution of \\(r \\rightarrow 2\\), followed immediately by execution\nof \\(r \\rightarrow r + 3\\)} logically entails that \\(r = 5\\) in the\nimmediately resulting state.\n\n\nIn the case of Turing-machine programs, Turing developed a detailed\nlogical notation for expressing all such deductions (Turing 1936).\n\n(In fact, the successful execution of any string of\ninstructions can be represented deductively in this\nfashion\u2014Kripke has not drawn attention to a feature special to\ncomputation. The instructions do not need to be ones that a computer\ncan carry out.)\n\nThe second step of Kripke\u2019s argument is to appeal to what he\nrefers to as Hilbert\u2019s thesis: this is the thesis that\nthe steps of any mathematical argument can be expressed \u201cin a\nlanguage based on first-order logic (with identity)\u201d (Kripke\n2013: 81). The practice of calling this claim \u201cHilbert\u2019s\nthesis\u201d originated in Barwise (1977: 41), but it should be noted\nthat since Hilbert regarded second-order logic as indispensable (see,\ne.g., Hilbert & Ackermann 1928: 86), the name\n\u201cHilbert\u2019s thesis\u201d is potentially misleading.\n\nApplying \u201cHilbert\u2019s thesis\u201d to Kripke\u2019s above\nquoted claim that \u201ca computation is just another mathematical\ndeduction\u201d (2013: 80) yields:\n\n\nevery (human) computation can be formalized as a valid deduction\ncouched in the language of first-order predicate calculus with\nidentity.\n\n\nNow, applying G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem to this yields\nin turn:\n\n\nevery (human) computation is provable in first-order predicate\ncalculus with identity, in the sense that, given an appropriate\nformalization, each step of the computation can be derived from the\ninstructions (possibly in conjunction with ancillary premises, e.g.,\nwell-known mathematical premises, or premises concerning numbers that\nare supplied to the computer at the start of the computation).\n\n\nFinally, applying Turing\u2019s provability theorem to this\nintermediate conclusion yields the Church-Turing thesis:\n\n\nevery (human) computation can be done by Turing machine.\n\n",
