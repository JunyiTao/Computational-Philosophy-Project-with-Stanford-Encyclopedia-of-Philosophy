The thesis\nis often more precisely formulated as a supervenience claim. Two\ntheses here should be distinguished:\n\n(1) For any two phenomenally identical experiences, there are some\naccuracy conditions that they share.\n\n\n(2) Any two phenomenally identical experiences have the same accuracy\nconditions.\n\n\nClaim (2) says that all accuracy conditions are determined by\nphenomenology, claim (1) says that at least some are.\n\nClaim (1) constrains which contents experiences have. Shoemaker\ndevelops this idea in a series of papers (1994, 2005). See also\nChalmers (2004, 2005).\n\nThe two theses above are both entailed by a strong version of\nrepresentationalism, which combines representationalism with the\nthesis that any two experiences with the same phenomenal properties\nhave the same representational properties. This sort of\nrepresentationalism is sometimes held in the guise of an identity\nclaim: the claim that phenomenal properties are identical to\nrepresentational properties. Versions of this view are defended by\nDretske 1995, Tye 2000, and Carruthers 2000. But theses (1) and (2)\ncan be held even if one rejects these strong representationalist\ntheses. Some philosophers hold (1) on the grounds that the\nrepresentational content of an experience is grounded in its\nphenomenology. According to Horgan and Tienson 2002, for example,\nthere is a kind of content that experiences have in virtue of their\nphenomenology, so that their phenomenology has explanatory priority\nover the content itself. This view is suggested by Siewert (1998) and\ndefended by Kriegel (2002; 2013), and see entry on\n phenomenal intentionality.\n\n\nSome philosophers deny both (1) and (2) on the grounds that the\naccuracy-conditions of an experience are determined in part by\nextra-cranial features, while the phenomenology of an experience is\nnot. These philosophers are internalist about phenomenology, but\nexternalist about experience content. (Block 1990 and 1996, Speaks\n2009).\n8. Theories of Intentionality for Experience\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve discussed some reasons to think that there are\ncontentful experiences, and some questions about what sorts of\ncontents there might be. A different cluster of questions concerns\nwhat makes it the case that an experience has the contents it does.\nHow is representation of any property is possible? Two sorts of\ntheories addressing this question are addressed in\n Section 8.2\n and\n Section 8.3,\n and some possible constraints on such theories are reviewed in\n Section 8.1.\n8.1 Externalism vs. Internalism About Perceptual Content\n\nExternalism about experience content (or\nexperience-content externalism) is the thesis that subjects\nalike in properties that are intrinsic to them need not share the same\nexperience contents. If experience-content externalism is true, then\nwhat makes it the case that an experience has the content it does\ndepends on external relations to things outside the subject\u2019s\nskin, such as social relations between the subject and others, or\ncausal relations to things in the environment. Defenders of\nexperience-content externalism include Dretske, Lycan, and Tye, all of\nwhom argue for experiential externalism on the grounds that the\nalleged best naturalistic theories of intentionality for experience\nare externalist theories. (For discussion of externalism about the\ncontent of other mental states, see the entry on\n external theories of content.)\n\nA thesis opposed to experience-content externalism is\nexperience-content internalism. Put roughly, this is the\nthesis that experience content is determined entirely by the\nindividual\u2019s intrinsic properties. Total experience-content\ninternalism is the thesis that all experience content is\ndetermined by the individual\u2019s intrinsic properties (i.e., that\ntwo subjects alike in all intrinsic respects will have exactly the\nsame experiential contents). Partial experience-content\ninternalism is the thesis that there is a sort of\nexperiential content that is determined by a subject\u2019s intrinsic\nproperties (i.e., two subjects alike in all intrinsic respects will\nhave the same experiential contents of this sort. This thesis allows\nthat experiences may also have some externally determined contents.\nTotal experiential internalism is defended by Segal 1991 and Matthews\n1985; partial experience-content internalism is defended by Chalmers\n2004.\n\nExternalism and internalism about contents are distinct theses from\nexternalism and internalism about phenomenology. Internalism about\nphenomenology is the thesis that intrinsic duplicates are\nphenomenal duplicates. Externalism about phenomenology is the\ndenial of this thesis, on the grounds that phenomenology is determined\nin part by factors outside a subject\u2019s skin. Externalism about\nphenomenology is sometimes motivated by representationalism about\nphenomenology combined with externalism about content. If one is\nexternalist about experiential content, and if one holds that the\ncontent and the phenomenology of an experience co-vary, then one must\nalso be an externalist about phenomenology. This thesis is defended by\nDretske (1995) and Lycan (2001), and criticized by Block (1990) and\n(1996). For further discussion, see the entry on\n external theories of content.\n\nOne of the main motivations for experience-content internalism is the\nidea that only internally individuated states can figure in\npsychological explanations. This mirrors one of the main motivations\nfor internalism about the contents of other mental states. The general\nissue is reviewed in the entry on\n externalism.\n In the case of experience, philosophers have pursued this debate with\nrespect to Marr\u2019s computational theory of vision, one of the\nleading empirical theories of visual processing. The debate is over\nwhether Marr\u2019s theory itself posits any externally-individuated\ncontents, or whether the contents it posits are all individuated\ninternalistically. If Marr\u2019s theory is correct and explanatory,\nand if the representational contents it posits are externally\nindividuated, then it provides a counter-example to\nindividualists\u2019 claims that only internally-determined contents\nfigure in psychological explanation. The debate thus focuses on\nexactly what commitments Marr\u2019s theory makes about the\nindividuation of perceptual content.\n\nThough Marr\u2019s theory posits representational states, it does not\nmake use of the notion of a visual experience, and it is an open\nquestion how experiences map onto the stages of computational visual\nprocessing posited by the theory (see Marr (1982), section 7.2 for\nMarr\u2019s own brief discussion of this issue). Marr\u2019s theory\nseeks to explain how the visual system arrives at representations of a\nthree-dimensional array given retinal stimulation as input. The\nretinal stimulations, or \u2018gray arrays\u2019, are computational\ndescriptions that represent light and intensity values in a\ntwo-dimensional coordinate system. According to Marr, the visual\nsystem computes a description of a three-dimensional scene in three\nstages. First, given the gray arrays, it computes a \u2018primal\nsketch\u2019 of reflectance changes on the surface outside the\nviewer. Next, with the primal sketch as input, it computes a\n\u20182.5-D sketch\u2019 of this surface, a sketch that explicitly\nrepresents information concerning depth and contours of the surfaces\nrelative to the viewer. (The depth information concerns only facing\nsurfaces, so that the 2.5 sketch contains no information\u2014and\ntherefore no misinformation\u2014about how surfaces continue out of\nview.) Finally, given the 2.5 sketch as input, the visual system\ncomputes information concerning all three dimensions of objects, one\nthat describes their shapes and orientations. According to the theory,\nthe computation at each stage combines the input from the previous\nstage with assumptions that are supposedly built into the visual\nsystem.\n\nThe debate is over whether Marr\u2019s theory allows two subjects,\ncall them V and V*, to have different visual\ncontents, when V is a normal perceiver on earth, and\nV* is an intrinsic duplicate of V, with the same\ngray arrays as those had by V, and undergoes the same\nsequence of computations, viewed internally. V*\u2019s gray\narrays, however, have different distal causes. Borrowing an example\nfrom Burge (1986), suppose that V\u2019s gray arrays are\ntypically caused by shadows, and occasionally caused by cracks;\nwhereas V* lives in a world where the optical laws are\ndifferent, and there are no instances of the sort of shadows that\ncause V\u2019s gray arrays. According to Burge, Marr\u2019s\ntheory says that the contentful visual states that are computed from\nV\u2019s gray arrays always represent shadows, and thus the\nones that arise from gray arrays caused by cracks are misperceptions;\nwhile the contentful visual states that are computed from\nV*\u2019s gray arrays represent cracks. Neither V\nnor V* can discriminate the relevant sorts of cracks from the\nrelevant sort of shadows, but according to Burge this is not\nsufficient to make their contents the same. According to Gabriel\nSegal, in contrast, the contentful visual states computed from both\nV and V*\u2019s gray arrays represent a property\nmore general than the property of being a crack or the property of\nbeing a shadow\u2014a \u2018crackdow\u2019. (For further\ndiscussion, see Matthews 1988, Burge 1988, Davies 1991, Shapiro 1993,\nEgan 1991, and Patterson 1996.)\n8.2 Functionalist Informational Theories of Experience\n\nDretske and Tye have each proposed that an experience has the contents\nit does in virtue of having certain functional properties.\n\nAccording to Dretske, an experience has its content fixed by the\nbiological, phylogenetically determined function of the system (or\ncombination of systems: (1995), 22) of which it is a state. The\nfunction of the system is to provide information: for instance, the\nfunction of the auditory system is to provide information about pitch,\nintensity, timbre, and direction of sound, and it does this by\noccupying different states corresponding to different values for each\nof these properties. The different states are all the different\nauditory experiences that a given system is capable of being in. The\nsame main idea is developed by Ruth Millikan, who focuses on mental\ncontent generally rather than on experience content per\nse.\n\nTye\u2019s account of experience content derives from the theories of\nintentionality for belief developed by Stampe (1977) and Stalnaker\n(1984). According to Tye, an experience S of creature\nc has the content that p just in case: \u201cIf\noptimal conditions were to obtain, S would be tokened in\ncreature c if and only if P were the case; moreover,\nin these circumstances, S would be tokened in c\nbecause P is the case\u201d (2000, 136, note omitted; cf.\n1995, 101). For the case of visual experiences, Tye, like Dretske,\nappeals to the design of the visual system to explain what\n\u201coptimal conditions\u201d are: \u201cIn the case of evolved\ncreatures, it is natural to hold that such conditions for vision\ninvolve the various components of the visual system operating as they\nwere designed to do in the sort of external environment in which they\nwere designed to operate\u201d (Tye 2000, 138).\n\nBoth kinds of theories are externalist: according to them,\nwhat makes it the case that a subject\u2019s mental state has the\ncontent it does is in part facts about the subject\u2019s\nenvironment. Any objections to externalism about mental content are\nthus also objections to these theories of intentionality. For\ninstance, suppose there was a creature, Swampman, who suddenly popped\ninto existence due to random conglomeration of particles, and happened\nto be an intrinsic molecular duplicate of, say, Jerry Fodor. Pure\nexternalist theories (that is, theories that hold that the only way\nmental states can have content is by standing in the right external\nrelations to the subject\u2019s environment) are committed to denying\nthat Swampman would have any contentful mental states. Some\nphilosophers have found this commitment counterintuitive. For further\ndiscussion of this objection and others, see the entry on\n external theories of mental content.\n\nA central challenge facing Dretske\u2019s and Millikan\u2019s theory\nis to specify the relevant notions of informational system\nand function in an informational system. One question in the\narea is whether informational systems and functions within them are\ncontained within an organism, or whether they rather encompass\nmultiple organisms in a community. Much work by Millikan has been\ndevoted to this topic. According to her, an informational system\nencompasses both creatures who produce representations, and creatures\nwho use or receive them; and the relevant notion of function is\nsupposed to be defined in terms of both parts of such a system. For\ninstance, in a bee dance, what makes it the case that the bee dance\nrepresents the location of nectar is in part that other bees respond\nto it by flying to the nectar. A analogous challenge for co-variation\ntheories inspired by Stampe and Stalnaker is to specify what the\nrelevant \u2018becausal\u2019 relations are. Until these central\nnotions are pinned down, the theories remain programmatic.\n\nOne objection that has been raised against both kinds of informational\ntheories of experience (those that invoke biological functions, and\nthose that invoke co-variation) is that these theories are\ninsufficiently general. According to the objection, there can be\nproperties represented in a subject\u2019s experience even if she has\nnot been in causal contact with instances of those properties before,\nand which it is no part of the biological function of the visual\nsystem to represent. For example, consider impossible scenes depicted\nin Escher drawings, or a hallucination of a color that one has never\nseen before (such as Hume\u2019s missing shade of blue). Suppose\nexperiences can represent that one is standing before an Escher\nstaircase, or that something is the missing shade of blue. According\nto Tye\u2019s theory, this can happen only if in optimal conditions\nthat type of experience is tokened because these things are the case.\nBut since it is logically impossible to be standing before an Escher\nstaircase, this condition can never be met. And if it is nomologically\nimpossible to be seeing anything that is the missing shade of blue,\nthen even if the proposed necessary condition in principle can be met,\nthe worlds in which it is met would seem to be irrelevant ones for the\npurpose of the theory. So, the objection concludes, Tye\u2019s theory\nmust predict that Escher staircases and missing shades of color cannot\nbe represented in experience. For further discussion of objections to\ninformational theories, see the entry on\n causal theories of mental content.\n \n8.3 Phenomenal Intentionality\n\nAccording to some philosophers (e.g., Horgan and Tienson 2002; Kriegel\n2002, 2013; Siewert 1998), there is a some content of experience that\nis constitutively determined by the experience\u2019s phenomenology\nalone (Horgan and Tienson 2002, p. 524). Horgan and Tienson call this\nthesis phenomenal intentionality (See entry on\n phenomenal intentionality).\n A consequence of the thesis is that phenomenology enjoys explanatory\npriority over intentionality. Proponents of phenomenal intentionality\ntake phenomenology as a primitive notion, which cannot be reduced to\ncontent, and then try to explain (at least some kinds of) content in\nterms of it.\n\nIf the phenomenal intentionality thesis is true, then phenomenology\ncannot be reduced or identified with content, or with the having of\ncontent. The thesis thus stands in contrast to views defended by\nDretske and Tye according to which the content of experience is wholly\nexplained in causal or functional terms, where one does not need to\ninvoke phenomenology to explain why an experience has the content it\nhas. These latter views leave open the possibility that the content of\nan experience enjoys explanatory priority over its phenomenology, so\nthat one can explain phenomenology in terms of content.\n\nTogether with the assumption (made by Horgan and Tienson and by\nKriegel) that phenomenology is narrow (i.e., shared by intrinsic\nduplicates), the thesis of phenomenal intentionality yields an\ninternalist theory of experience content. This introduces\nanother respect in which phenomenal intentionality stands opposed to\nsome versions of functionalist informational theories of experience\ncontent\u2014namely, those versions that hold that the only\ncontents experiences can have are those had in virtue of the\nfunctional properties of the sort discussed in\n Section 8.2.\n If the thesis of phenomenal intentionality is true and phenomenology\nis narrow, then there are narrow contents that are constitutively\ndetermined by phenomenology. Any objections to narrow content will\nthus also apply to this thesis. For further discussion of narrow\ncontent, see the entry on\n narrow content.\n9. Directions for Future Research\n\nThere is much more research in philosophy to be done on the contents\nof experience. A great deal of theorizing has focused on visual\nexperiences. Even so, none of the questions discussed above are fully\nsettled, and so there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nany of those topics. Additional topics ripe for future research\ninclude questions such as: what is the relation between perceptual\ncontent and perceptual contact with reality?; how do experiences in\ndifferent modalities interact?; what role does experiential content\nplay in reasoning, in intentional action and more generally in being\nan agent?; and how are perceptual constancies reflected in the\ncontents of experience?; what notion of contents of experience is most\ntheoretically useful for unconscious perception, and how may the\nlatter be distinguished among the varieties of subpersonal information\nprocessing?",
