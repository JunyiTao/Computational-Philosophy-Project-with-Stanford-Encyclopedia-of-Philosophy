    "main_text": "Mathematical Applications of the Axiom of Choice\n4. Mathematical Applications of the Axiom of Choice\n\n\nThe Axiom of Choice has numerous applications in mathematics, a\nnumber of which have proved to be formally equivalent to\n it[13].\n Historically the most important application was the first, namely:\n\nThe Well-Ordering Theorem (Zermelo 1904,\n1908). Every set can be well-ordered.  \n\n\nAfter Zermelo published his 1904 proof of the well-ordering theorem\nfrom AC, it was quickly seen that the two are equivalent.\n\n\n\nAnother early equivalent of AC is\n\nThe Multiplicative Axiom (Russell 1906). The\nproduct of any set of non-zero cardinal numbers is non-zero.\n\n\n\nEarly applications of AC include:\n\nEvery infinite set has a denumerable subset. This principle, again\nweaker than AC, cannot be proved without it in the\ncontext of the remaining axioms of set theory.\nEvery infinite cardinal number is equal to its square.  This was\nproved equivalent to AC in Tarski 1924.\nEvery vector space has a basis (initiated by Hamel 1905). This was\nproved equivalent to AC in Blass 1984.\nEvery field has an algebraic closure (Steinitz 1910). This\nassertion is weaker than AC, indeed is a consequence\nof the (weaker) compactness theorem for first-order logic (see\nbelow).\nThere is a Lebesgue nonmeasurable set of real numbers (Vitali\n1905). This was shown much later to be a consequence of\nBPI (see below) and hence weaker than\nAC. Solovay (1970) established its independence of\nthe remaining axioms of set theory.\n\n\n\nA significant \u201cfolklore\u201d equivalent of AC is\n\nThe Set-Theoretic Distributive Law. For an\narbitrary doubly-indexed family of sets\n\\(\\{M_{i,j}: i \\in I,j \\in J\\}\\), and where\n\\(J^I\\) is the set of all functions with\ndomain \\(I\\) and which take values in \\(J\\):\n\n\\[\n \\bigcap_{i\\in I} \\bigcup_{j\\in J} M_{i,j} \n =\n \\bigcup_{f\\in J^I} \\bigcap_{i\\in I} M_{i,f(i)}\n\\] \n\n\n A much-studied special case of AC is the\n\nPrinciple of Dependent Choices (Bernays 1942, Tarski\n1948). For any nonempty relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(A\\) for which\n\\(\\range(R) \\subseteq \\domain(R)\\), there is a function \\(f: \\omega\n\\rightarrow A\\) such that, for all \\(n\\in \\omega, R(f(n),f(n+1))\\).\nThis principle, although (much) weaker than AC, cannot be\nproved without it in the context of the remaining axioms of set\ntheory.\n\n\n Mathematical equivalents of AC include:\n\nTychonov\u2019s Theorem (1930): the product of compact\ntopological spaces is compact. This was proved equivalent to\nAC in Kelley 1950. But for compact Hausdorff spaces it is\nequivalent to BPI (see below) and hence weaker than\nAC\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem\n(L\u00f6wenheim 1915, Skolem 1920, Tarski and Vaught 1957): a\nfirst-order sentence having a model of infinite cardinality \\(\\kappa\\)\nalso has a model of any infinite cardinality \\(\\mu\\) such that \n\\(\\mu \\le \\kappa\\).  This was proved equivalent to AC by\nTarski.\nKrein-Milman Theorem: the unit ball \\(B\\) of the\ndual of a real normed linear space has an extreme point, that is, one\nwhich is not an interior point of any line segment in \\(B\\). This was\nproved equivalent to AC in Bell and Fremlin 1972a. There it\nis shown that, given any indexed family \\(\\sA\\) of nonempty sets,\nthere is a natural bijection between choice functions on \\(\\sA\\) and\nthe extreme points of the unit ball of the dual of a certain real\nnormed linear space constructed from \\(\\sA\\).\nEvery distributive lattice has a maximal ideal. This was proved\nequivalent to AC in Klimovsky 1958, and for lattices\nof sets in Bell and Fremlin 1972.\nEvery commutative ring with identity has a maximal ideal. This was\nproved equivalent to AC by Hodges 1979.\n\n\n There are a number of mathematical consequences of AC\nwhich are known to be\n weaker[14]\n than it, in particular:\n\nThe Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem\n(BPI): every Boolean algebra has a maximal (or prime)\nideal. This was shown to be weaker than AC in Halpern\nand Levy 1971.\nThe Stone Representation Theorem for Boolean\nalgebras (Stone 1936): every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to\na field of sets. This is equivalent to BPI and hence\nweaker than AC \nCompactness Theorem for First-Order Logic\n(G\u00f6del 1930, Malcev 1937, others): if every finite subset of\na set of first-order sentences has a model, then the set has a\nmodel. This was shown, in Henkin 1954, to be equivalent to\nBPI, and hence weaker than AC.\nCompleteness Theorem for First-Order Logic\n(G\u00f6del 1930, Henkin 1954): each consistent set of first-order\nsentences has a model. This was shown by Henkin in 1954 to be\nequivalent to BPI, and hence weaker than\nAC. If the cardinality of the model is specified in\nthe right way, the assertion becomes equivalent to\nAC.\n\n\n Finally, there is\n\nThe Sikorski Extension Theorem for Boolean\nalgebras (Sikorski 1949): every complete Boolean algebra is\ninjective, i.e., for any Boolean algebra \\(A\\) and any complete\nBoolean algebra \\(B\\), any homomorphism of a subalgebra of\n\\(A\\) into \\(B\\) can be extended to the whole of\n\\(A\\).\n\n\n The question of the equivalence of this with AC is one of\nthe few remaining interesting open questions in this area; while it\nclearly implies BPI, it was proved independent of\nBPI in Bell 1983.\n Many of these theorems are discussed in Bell and Machover (1977).\n\n",
