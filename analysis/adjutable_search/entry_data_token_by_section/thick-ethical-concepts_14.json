    "main_text": "The Delineation Question: How Do Thick and Thin Concepts Differ? || Thick and Thin Differ in Degree\n6. Thick Concepts Outside of Ethics\n\nThick concepts have been a stable topic of debate among moral\nphilosophers since the seminal discussion in Williams (1985) and have\nenjoyed something of a resurgence in ethics since 2010 or so. Thick\nconcepts are also receiving increasing attention in such other areas\nof philosophy as epistemology, aesthetics, legal philosophy, and more.\n(Such attention is often motivated, as in ethics, by dissatisfaction\nwith the extant state of the field.)\n\nFor some while now, aestheticians and philosophers of art have paid\nattention to thick aesthetic concepts such as garish,\ndelicate, and balanced, in addition to\nthin(ner) concepts such as beautiful and ugly.\nSome of these discussions go back to the\n1950s, predating the post-Williams debate in ethics, but concern some\nof the same issues even if they don\u2019t use the label\n\u201cthick\u201d (Beardsley 1982 and Sibley 2001; see also Burton\n1992 and Zangwill 1995). Also relevant is the recent attention to\n\u201cdual character concepts\u201d (section 1) in art (Liao et\nal. 2020). Discussions of thick aesthetic concepts often mirror\ndiscussions in ethics about whether thick terms are evaluative as a\nmatter of truth-conditions or only pragmatically (recent examples\nincludes Bonzon 2009, Zangwill 2013, and Stojanovic 2016). Of\nparticular interest and potentially broader significance is the\nemerging exploration of whether also thin aesthetic terms might be\nplausibly treated as only pragmatically evaluative (Sundell 2016).\n\nThere has been increasing attention in epistemology to thick epistemic\nconcepts such as gullible, quick to jump to\nconclusions, and open-minded. This is\nparticularly common in virtue epistemology, which seeks to explain\nepistemic properties such as knowledge and justified belief in terms\nof the cognizer\u2019s intellectual virtues and vices. Whether\nfocusing on thick epistemic concepts can lead to a preferable\nepistemology is the topic of several papers in a special issue of the\njournal Philosophical Papers (Kotzee and Wanderer 2008; see\nalso Battaly 2001). A foundational question here is whether there is a\ndistinction between thick and thin epistemic concepts and whether it\nbe understood in the same way as the distinction between thick and\nthin ethical concepts (V\u00e4yrynen 2008; Roberts 2018a). For\ninstance, are thick epistemic concepts supposed to be thick in the\nsense that they involve evaluation and non-evaluative description, or\nin the sense that they involve epistemic and non-epistemic content?\n(These are different distinctions even if epistemic content is often\nevaluative and non-epistemic content often non-evaluative.) These\ndiscussions almost invariably assume that knowledge\nis a thin concept. But Brent Kyle argues\nthat knowledge is better understood as a thick\nconcept and uses its thickness to cast light on why the so-called\nGettier problem for definitions of knowledge arises (Kyle 2013b).\n\nBeyond ethics, aesthetics, and epistemology, attention to thick\nconcepts has been more scattered. In legal philosophy, David Enoch and\nKevin Toh suggest not only that legal statements often express\nconcepts that seem thick, such as crime and\ninheritance, but also that legal\nis itself a thick concept. Specifically, it\ninvolves both a representation of certain social facts and a kind of\nevaluative endorsement. Treating legal as a\nthick concept allows debates about the nature of law to draw on the\nbroader philosophical context of debates about thick concepts in\nethics, and in this way has potential to introduce new input into and\noptions for thinking about the nature of law. (Enoch and Toh 2013.) In\nmetaphysics, Gideon Yaffe argues that if we treat free will as a thick\nconcept that involves positive evaluation of items that fall under it,\nwe are better able to explain certain facts about freedom of will than\nif we proceed with the more standard assumption that freedom of will\nis a non-evaluative concept (Yaffe 2000). Finally, the idea of a thick\nconcept has also been invoked to do significant work in various areas\nof applied philosophy. Empirical research on moral judgment in\npsychology and neuroscience may be criticized for having restricted\nits studies to judgments involving thin concepts and ignoring thick\nconcepts, especially if thick concepts are irreducibly thick (Abend\n2011; see also FitzGerald and Goldie 2012). In environmental ethics,\nclassifying concepts such as ecological\nintegrity as thick might be thought to buttress their normative\nsignificance (Shockley 2012). In risk theory, arguing that concepts of\nrisk and safety are\nthick might help to show how these concepts can be evaluative without\nbeing socially constructed (M\u00f6ller 2012). Outside of philosophy,\nit has been suggested that sociological research into specific\ngroups\u2019 or societies\u2019 repertoires of thick concepts can\ndeliver insights into how thick concepts work which cannot be obtained\nfrom the armchair and provide access to important aspects of social\nlife which aren\u2019t accessible via thin concepts (Abend 2019).\nTime will tell whether thick concepts will come to make a greater\nimpact in these and other areas.\n\nAttention to thick concepts in various areas of philosophy is often\ninspired by dissatisfaction with dominant lines of research and the\nhope that thick concepts will redirect the work in these areas. We\nhave seen that cashing out this hope often requires substantial\nassumptions regarding issues such as the anti-disentangling argument,\nshapelessness, the inseparability of evaluation and description, and\nthe location of evaluation in the semantics and pragmatics of thick\nterms. A plausible theory of thick concepts may then not give thick\nconcepts the significance their fans take them to have, and either way\nthese assumptions attract substantial resistance in their own right.\nOn the other hand, those who find thick concepts to have little\ndistinctive significance nonetheless must ensure that evaluative and\nnormative domains can be accounted for in terms of thin concepts in a\nway that addresses the concerns that inspire interest in thick\nconcepts. Any complete theory of normativity and value must therefore\nreckon somehow or other with the fundamental issues concerning thick\nconcepts.\n",
