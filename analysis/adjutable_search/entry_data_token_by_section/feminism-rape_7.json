    "main_text": "The Wrongs and Harms of Rape || Harms to individual victims\n3.1 Harms to individual victims\n\nThe view most commonly identified with feminism in popular discourse\nis that rape is a crime of \u201cviolence, not sex\u201d\u2014that\nis, a form of assault whose sexual nature is irrelevant, and which is\nanalogous to other violent crimes. While this view has rarely been\ndefended by feminist philosophers, it has been prominent in some\nfeminist anti-rape public education and activism. (One feminist\ntheorist often claimed to have held this view is Susan Brownmiller\n(1975); see Cahill 2001, 16-28.) Such efforts often seek to challenge\nviews of rape as a \u201ccrime of passion,\u201d motivated by the\nperpetrator\u2019s overwhelming lust (presumably in response to the\nvictim\u2019s sexual attractiveness and/or provocation). Thus, in\naddition to challenging victim-blaming assumptions, feminists often\nemphasized rapists\u2019 non-sexual motivations, such as anger and\nthe desire for dominance and control; on this view, the rapist is a\nviolent criminal like other violent criminals, not just a guy seeking\nsex a bit too vigorously. Similarly, this approach emphasizes that\nrape victims are real crime victims, not vaguely titillating people\nwho had some overly rough sex and might just have liked it.\n\nThe limitations of the \u201cviolence, not sex\u201d approach,\nhowever, are fairly glaring. Rape\u2019s sexual nature is central to\nunderstanding both its perpetrators\u2019 motivations and its effects\non victims, not to mention the crime\u2019s broader social and\nideological roots and consequences. While perpetrators differ in their\nstrongest occurrent motivations, it is important to ask why so many\nmen who wish to harm or violate women do so in a sexual manner.\nFurthermore, some rapes do occur because a man wants to have sex, and\nperhaps would even prefer it if his partner consented, but is prepared\nto proceed without her consent. Rape\u2019s sexual character is\ncentral from the perspective of both actual and potential victims; as\nCahill observes, \u201cfew women would agree that being raped is\nessentially equivalent to being hit in the face\u201d (2001, 3).\nFurthermore, many rape survivors are damaged specifically in their\nsexuality, facing difficulties in their sexual relationships in the\nmonths and years following the rape. Finally, because many rapes do\nnot involve overt extrinsic violence, the \u201cviolence, not\nsex\u201d slogan may make it more difficult for people to recognize\nless obviously violent experiences of sexual force as rape. In short,\nrape is forced, abusive, and/or violent sex; recognizing\nrape\u2019s sexual nature is crucial to understanding not only its\nwrongs and harms, but also the cultural and political meaning of sex\nin patriarchal cultures. As MacKinnon observes, \u201cso long as we\nsay that [rape, sexual harassment, and pornography] are abuses of\nviolence, not sex, we fail to criticize what has been made of sex,\nwhat has been done to us through sex\u201d (1987, 86\u201387).\n\nThe violation of bodily and sexual autonomy is no doubt among\nrape\u2019s most central harms. In their classic discussion, Frye and\nShafer (1977) employ the concept of \u201cdomain\u201d to elaborate\non such violation. A person\u2019s domain\u2014\u201cthe physical,\nemotional, psychological, and intellectual space it lives in\u201d\n(338)\u2014defines the range of matters over which the person has\nrightful power of consent. Because a person\u2019s body is at the\nvery center of her domain and is the locus of the properties and\ncapacities that make her a person, the intentional invasion of the\nbody is an especially egregious attack: \u201cto presume to wield an\neffective power of consent over the personal properties and/or the\nbody of [a] creature \u2026 is ipso facto to deny that there is a\nperson there at all\u201d (340). Thus, rape treats the victim not as\na person but as an object, and one with a purely sexual function. Frye\nand Shafer emphasize that rape\u2019s communication of this message\nconstitutes one significant element of its harm: \u201c[rape] gives\n[the victim] a picture of herself as a being within someone\u2019s\ndomain and not as a being which has domain \u2026. Whether it is the\nrapist\u2019s intention or not, being raped conveys for the woman the\nmessage that she is a being without respect, that she is not a\nperson\u201d (341\u201342). Hampton sounds a similar theme,\ncontending that through its expressive\ncontent\u2014\u201crepresenting the rapist as master and the victim\nas inferior object\u201d\u2014rape does an objective \u201cmoral\ninjury\u201d to its victim\u2019s value (1999, 135). It is not\nsurprising, then, that many rape survivors describe feeling not only\nworthless, but also numb, absent, or deadened. The reaction is\nunderstandable since, as Cahill observes, \u201cRape, in its total\ndenial of the victim\u2019s agency, will, and personhood, can be\nunderstood as a denial of intersubjectivity itself \u2026. The self\nis at once denied and \u2026 stilled, silenced, overcome\u201d\n(2001, 132).\n\nSome recent discussions emphasize that a full account of rape\u2019s\nharm must incorporate both its denial of victims\u2019 personhood and\nits intimate, sexual and bodily nature. According to Cahill,\n\u201crape must be understood fundamentally \u2026 as an affront to\nthe embodied subject \u2026. a sexually specific act that destroys\n(if only temporarily) the intersubjective, embodied agency and\ntherefore personhood of a woman\u201d (2001, 13). Anderson, seeking\nto define rape\u2019s harm based on the \u201clived\nexperience\u201d of those who go through it, cites\n\u201cdehumanization, objectification, and domination\u201d as\nprominent in the accounts of both rapists and rape victims (2005,\n641). Rape, she concludes, is best understood not only as the denial\nof sexual autonomy, but as \u201csexually invasive\ndehumanization\u201d (643).\n\nLinda Mart\u00edn Alcoff, too, emphasizes rape\u2019s specifically\nsexual harm, arguing in particular that sexual violations can be both\nidentified and criticized on the basis of their damage to\nvictims\u2019 sexual subjectivity. Alcoff contends that \u201cAs a\nconcept, sexual subjectivity provides an alternative to the singular\nfocus on the violation of our consent, desire, the capacity for\npleasure, or will . . . our central concern with sexual violations\nshould be their inhibiting and transformative effects on sexual\nsubjectivity or our self-making capacities\u201d (2018, 111). Sexual\nsubjectivity, in her view, includes the capacity for sexual agency,\nbut more broadly amounts to \u201cour concernful making relationship\nto ourselves as sexual subjects\u201d (121). Survivors of sexual\nviolations, Alcoff contends, suffer damage to their ability to develop\nand live out, in a caring, reflective, and flexible way, their own\nsexual selfhood. \u201cWhat is violated,\u201d she writes, \u201cis\nnot a substantive set of normative or normal desires, but the\npractical activity of caring for the self. Trauma atrophies\npossibilities\u201d (145).\n\nThe humiliation and shame often experienced by rape victims are\npredictable results of experiencing total subjugation and the intimate\nloss of control of one\u2019s body. These reactions\u2014not to\nmention victims\u2019 feelings of contamination, of having been\ndefiled or desecrated\u2014are often exacerbated by cultural\njudgments of raped women as dirty and impure, or as \u201cdamaged\ngoods.\u201d In some cultures, these ideas are so powerful that a\nwoman who is raped (or who has consensual illicit sex) is thought to\nbring shame on her entire family; such women sometimes become the\nvictims of so-called \u201chonor killings\u201d at the hands of male\nrelatives (Banerjee 2003, Baxi et al. 2006, Ruggi 1998).\n\nA distinctive set of harms enters the picture when, as is increasingly\ncommon, women and girls are violated while unconscious, often with\npictures or videos taken and circulated. As Kelly Oliver points out,\n\u201clack of consent is valorized within popular culture to the\npoint that sexual assault has become a spectator sport and creepshot\nentertainment on social media \u2026 sex with unconscious girls,\nespecially accompanied by photographs as trophies, has become a goal\nof some boys and men\u201d (2016, 59\u201360). In such cases, Oliver\nobserves, \u201cThe trauma of victimization not only becomes public\nbut also infinitely repeatable. It can go viral. It doesn\u2019t go\naway\u201d (91). Cressida Heyes (2016) provides a phenomenological\naccount of the devastating harms of raping an unconscious victim.\nRaping someone who is unconscious, Heyes contends,\n\nexploits and reinforces a victim\u2019s lack of agency and exposes\nher body in ways that make it especially difficult for her to\nreconstitute herself as a subject. It damages both her ability to\nengage with the world in four dimensions (through a temporally\npersisting body schema) and her ability to retreat from it into\nanonymity \u2026 Sexual assault while unconscious can make the\nrestful anonymity of sleep impossible, leaving only the violent\nexposure of a two-dimensional life. (2016, 365)\n\n\nThe assumption that such rapes are less harmful than the rapes of\nconscious victims--since the rape itself is not directly\nexperienced--is therefore badly mistaken, Heyes argues. The victim of\nunconscious rape, she points out, \u201cstruggles to feel safe\nlapsing into the one form of anonymity that is biologically and\nexistentially necessary for human life, yet ultimately she will have\nno choice but to revisit this place over and over \u2026 no one can\navoid going to sleep for very long\u201d (2016, 379).\n\nMany rapes lead to additional harms beyond those intrinsic to the rape\nitself. Some rapes cause pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases\n(including HIV infection), and some rapists physically injure their\nvictims. Victims who do not reveal their rapes to others, whether due\nto shame or to the expectation that they will not be believed,\nexperience profound isolation and lack of support; and indeed, many\nwho do report their rapes are disbelieved or blamed by friends,\nfamily, and/or police. Even those survivors who are believed too often\nface, as Alcoff points out, a kind of \u201cpreemptive\ndisauthorization or assumption that [they] are incapable of measured\nand thoughtful analysis\u201d (2018, 50). Due to both low reporting\nlevels and low conviction rates, relatively few victims see their\nrapists punished; many of those raped by relatives, co-workers,\nfriends, or other ongoing acquaintances must then face continuing\ninteraction with the rapist, while those raped by strangers often fear\nthat the rapist will find and re-victimize them.\n\nWith or without these additional harms (but especially with them),\nrape constitutes severe trauma. Undergoing trauma shatters the\nvictim\u2019s most basic assumptions about herself and her safety in\nthe world. According to Brison, who survived a violent rape and\nattempted murder, trauma\n\nintroduces a \u201csurd\u201d\u2014a nonsensical entry\u2014into\nthe series of events in one\u2019s life, making it seem impossible to\ncarry on with the series \u2026 . Not only is it now impossible to\ncarry on with the series, but whatever sense had been made of it in\nthe past has been destroyed. The result is an uneasy paralysis. I\ncan\u2019t go, I can\u2019t stay. All that is left is the\npresent, but one that has no meaning, or has, at most, only the\nshifting sense of a floating indexical, the dot of a \u201cnow\u201d\nthat would go for a walk, if only it knew where to go. (2002,\n103\u2013104)\n\n\nWith its profound effects on social connection, cognition, memory, and\nemotion, trauma disrupts the continuity of the self. It is strikingly\ncommon for a trauma survivor to feel that she is not the same person\nshe was prior to the trauma, and even that at least a part of her has\ndied; as Brison puts it, \u201cI felt as if I was experiencing things\nposthumously \u2026 as though I\u2019d somehow outlived\nmyself\u201d (8\u20139). To reconstitute the self in a new form, the\nsurvivor must construct a meaningful narrative that incorporates the\ntrauma, but many survivors face obstacles in this endeavor such as\ndisordered cognition, memory gaps, feelings of despair and futility,\nand the lack of an audience willing to hear, believe, and understand\ntheir story. Such isolation is exacerbated when the trauma was humanly\ninflicted (as with rape), since such assaults, as Brison puts it,\n\u201c[sever] the sustaining connection between the self and the rest\nof humanity\u201d (40). Brison\u2019s own account emphasizes the\n\u201cextent to which the self is created and sustained by others\nand, thus, is able to be destroyed by them\u201d (62); this\nrelational element is central both to trauma itself and to any\npossible recovery. Because \u201cviolent intrusions by others\n\u2026 severely impair our ability to be connected to humanity in\nways we value\u201d (61), recovery requires slowly repairing\nconnections\u2014both to others and to damaged parts of\noneself\u2014and rebuilding a sense of trust (again, of both oneself\nand others).\n\nFor many women, rape is not a one-time event; rather sexual violence\nand exploitation are, for at least some period of time, routine\nconditions of their lives. Such women experience female sexual\nslavery, defined by Barry as any situation in which\n\nwomen or girls cannot change the immediate conditions of their\nexistence; where regardless of how they got into those conditions they\ncannot get out; and where they are subject to sexual violence and\nexploitation. (1984, 40)\n\n\nAs Barry observes, such situations include battering relationships,\nmost prostitution, and the sexual abuse of girl children, all of which\nare common around the world. It is thus important to consider the\ndistinctive effects of such repeated and routine sexual trauma. Herman\nhas recommended the adoption of a new diagnosis, complex\npost-traumatic stress disorder, to describe accurately the\npsychological impact of \u201cprolonged, repeated trauma\u201d\n(1997, 119). (This diagnosis is intended to encompass various forms of\nhumanly inflicted trauma, not only sexual trauma.) The damage of such\nprolonged trauma to a victim\u2019s personality may be so severe as\nto constitute what Frye has called mayhem: a psychic\n\u201cmaiming\u201d in which the exploiter instills in his victim\nsuch a grossly distorted perspective on herself, her function, and her\nworth that she becomes (whether temporarily or permanently) unable to\nidentify or pursue her own interests, assert her rights, or defend\nherself against further aggression (1983, 70).\n",
