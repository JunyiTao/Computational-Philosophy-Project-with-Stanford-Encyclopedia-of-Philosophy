    "main_text": "Hypothetico-deductivism || The extended HD menu\n2.4 The extended HD menu\n\nNa\u00efve HD can be enriched by a resolute form of\npredictivism. According to this approach, the na\u00efve HD\nclause for confirmation is too weak because \\(e\\) must have been\npredicted in advance from \\(h\\wedge k\\). Karl Popper\u2019s\n(1934/1959) account of the \u201ccorroboration\u201d of hypotheses\nfamously embedded this view, but squarely predictivist stances can be\ntraced back to early modern thinkers like Christiaan Huygens\n(1629\u20131695) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716), and\nin Duhem\u2019s work itself. The predictivist sets a high bar for\nconfirmation. Her favorite examples typically include stunning\nepisodes in which the existence of previously unknown objects,\nphenomena, or whole classes of them is anticipated: the phases of\nVenus for Copernican astronomy or the discovery of Neptune for\nNewtonian physics, all the way up to the Higgs boson for so-called\nstandard model of subatomic particles.\n\nThe predictivist solution to the underdetermination problem is fairly\nradical: many of the relevant factual consequences of \\(h\\wedge k\\)\nwill be already known when this theory is articulated, and so unfit\nfor confirmation. Critics have objected that predictivism is in fact\nfar too restrictive. There seem to be many cases in which already\nknown phenomena clearly do provide support to a new hypothesis or\ntheory. Zahar (1973) first raised this problem of \u201cold\nevidence\u201d, then made famous by Glymour (1980a, 85 ff.) as a\ndifficulty for Bayesianism (see\n Section 3\n below). Examples of this kind abound in the history of science as\nelsewhere, but the textbook illustration has become the precession of\nMercury\u2019s perihelion, a lasting anomaly for Newtonian physics:\nEinstein\u2019s general relativity calculations got this long-known\nfact right, thereby gaining a remarkable piece of initial support for\nthe new theory. In addition to this problem with old evidence, HD\npredictivism also seems to lack a principled rationale. After all, the\ntemporal order of the discovery of \\(e\\) and of the articulation of\n\\(h\\) and \\(k\\) may well be an entirely accidental historical\ncontingency. Why should it bear on the confirmation relationship among\nthem? (See Giere 1983 and Musgrave 1974 for classical discussions of\nthese issues. Douglas and Magnus 2013 and Barnes 2018 offer more\nrecent views and rich lists of further references.)\n\nAs a possible response to the difficulties above, na\u00efve HD can be\nenriched by the use-novelty criterion (UN) instead. The UN\nreaction to the underdetermination problem is more conservative than\nthe temporal predictivist strategy. According to this view, to improve\non the weak na\u00efve HD clause for confirmation one only has to rule\nout one particular class of cases, i.e., those in which the\ndescription of a known fact, \\(e\\), served as a constraint in the\nconstruction of \\(h\\wedge k\\). The UN view thus comes equipped with a\nrationale. If \\(h\\wedge k\\) was shaped on the basis of \\(e\\), UN\nadvocates point out, then it was bound to get that state of affairs\nright; the theory never ran any risk of failure, thus did not achieve\nany particularly significant success either. Precisely in these cases,\nand just for this reason, the evidence \\(e\\) must not be\ndouble-counted: by using it for the construction of the theory, its\nconfirmational power becomes \u201cdried out\u201d, so to speak.\n\nThe UN completion of na\u00efve HD originated from Lakatos and some of\nhis collaborators (see Lakatos and Zahar 1975 and Worrall 1978; also\nsee Giere 1979, 161\u2013162, and Gillies 1989 for similar views),\nalthough important hints in the same direction can be found at least\nin the work of William Whewell (1840/1847). Consider the touchstone\nexample of Mercury again. According to Zahar (1973), Einstein did not\nneed to rely on the Mercury data to define theory and auxiliaries as\nto match observationally correct values for the perihelion precession\n(also see Norton 2011a; and Earman and Janssen 1993 for a very\ndetailed, and more nuanced, account). Being already known, the fact\nwas not of course predicted in a strictly temporal sense, and yet, on\nZahar\u2019s reading, it could have been: it was\n\u201cuse-novel\u201d and thus fresh for use to confirm the theory.\nFor a more mundane illustration, so-called cross-validation\ntechniques represent a routine application of the UN idea in\nstatistical settings (as pointed out by Schurz 2014, 92; also see\nForster 2007, 592 ff.). According to some commentators, however, the\nUN criterion needs further elaboration (see Hitchcock and Sober 2004\nand Lipton 2005), while others have criticized it as essentially\nwrong-headed (see Howson 1990 and Mayo 1991, 2014; also see Votsis\n2014). \n\nYet another way to enrich na\u00efve HD is to combine it with\neliminativism. According to this view, the na\u00efve HD\nclause for confirmation is too weak because there must have been a low\n(enough) objective chance of getting the outcome \\(e\\) (favorable to\n\\(h\\)) if \\(h\\) was false, so that few possibilities exist that \\(e\\)\nmay have occurred for some reason other than the truth of \\(h\\).\nBriefly put, the occurrence of \\(e\\) must be such that most\nalternatives to \\(h\\) can be safely ruled out. The founding figure of\neliminativism is Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626). John Stuart Mill\n(1843/1872) is a major representative in later times, and Deborah\nMayo\u2019s \u201cerror-statistical\u201d approach to hypothesis\ntesting arguably develops this tradition (Mayo 1996 and Mayo and\nSpanos 2010; see Bird 2010, Kitcher 1993, 219 ff., and Meehl 1990 for\nother contemporary variations).\n\nEliminativism is most credible when experimentation is at issue (see,\ne.g., Guala 2012). Indeed, the appeal to Bacon\u2019s idea of\ncrucial experiment (instantia crucis) and related\nnotions (e.g., \u201csevere testing\u201d) is a fairly reliable mark\nof eliminativist inclinations. Experimentation is, to a large extent,\nprecisely an array of techniques to keep undesired interfering factors\nat a minimum by active manipulation and deliberate control (think of\nthe blinding procedure in medical trials, with \\(h\\) the hypothesized\neffectiveness of a novel treatment and \\(e\\) a relative improvement in\nclinical endpoints for a target subsample of patients thus treated).\nWhen this kind of control obtains, popular statistical tools are\nsupposed to allow for the calculation of the probability of \\(e\\) in\ncase \\(h\\) is false meant as a \u201crelative frequency in a (real or\nhypothetical) series of test applications\u201d (Mayo 1991, 529), and\nto secure a sufficiently low value to validate the positive outcome of\nthe test. It is much less clear how firm a grip this approach can\nretain when inference takes place at higher levels of generality and\ntheoretical commitment, where the hypothesis space is typically much\ntoo poorly ordered to fit routine error-statistical analyses. Indeed,\nLaudan (1997, 315; also see Musgrave 2010) spotted in this approach\nthe risk of a \u201cbalkanization\u201d of scientific reasoning,\nnamely, a restricted focus on scattered pieces of experimental\ninference (but see Mayo 2010 for a defense). \n\nNa\u00efve HD can also be enriched by the notion of\nsimplicity. According to this view, the na\u00efve HD clause\nfor confirmation is too weak because \\(h\\wedge k\\) must be a simple\n(enough), unified way to account for evidence \\(e\\). A classic\nreference for the simplicity view is Newton\u2019s first law of\nphilosophizing in the Principia (\u201cadmit no more causes\nof natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain\ntheir appearances\u201d), echoing very closely Ockham\u2019s razor.\nThis basic idea has never lost its appeal\u2014even up to recent\ntimes (see, e.g., Quine and Ullian 1970, 69 ff.; Sober 1975; Zellner,\nKeuzenkamp, and McAleer 2002; Scorzato 2013).\n\nDespite Thomas Kuhn\u2019s (1957, 181) suggestions to the contrary,\nthe success of Copernican astronomy over Ptolemy\u2019s system has\nremained an influential case study fostering the simplicity view\n(Martens 2009). Moreover, in ordinary scientific problems such as\ncurve fitting, formal criteria of model selection are applied\nwhere the paucity of parameters can be interpreted naturally as a key\ndimension of simplicity (Forster and Sober 1994). Traditionally, two\nmain problems have proven pressing, and frustrating, for the\nsimplicity approach. First, how to provide a sufficiently coherent and\nilluminating explication of this multifaceted and elusive notion (see\nRiesch 2010); and second, how to justify the role of simplicity as a\nproperly epistemic (rather than merely pragmatic)\nvirtue (see Kelly 2007, 2008).\n\nFinally, na\u00efve HD can be enriched by the appeal to\nexplanation. Here, the na\u00efve HD clause for confirmation\nis meant to be too weak because \\(h\\wedge k\\) must be able (not only\nto entail, but) to explain \\(e\\). By this move, the HD approach embeds\nthe slogan of the so-called inference to the best explanation\nview: \u201cobservations support the hypothesis precisely because it\nwould explain them\u201d (Lipton 2000, 185; also see Lipton 2004).\nHistorically, the main source for this connection between explanation\nand support is found in the work of Charles Sanders Peirce\n(1839\u20131914). Janssen (2003) offers a particularly neat\ncontemporary exhibit, explicitly aimed at \u201ccuring cases of the\nDuhem-Quine disease\u201d (484; also see Thagard 1978, and Douven\n2017 for a relevant survey). Quite unlike eliminativist approaches,\nexplanationist analyses tend to focus on large-scale theories and\nrelatively high-level kinds of evidence. Dealing with Einstein\u2019s\ngeneral relativity, for instance, Janssen (2003) greatly emphasizes\nits explanation of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass\n(essentially a brute fact in Newtonian physics) over the resolution of\nthe puzzle of Mercury\u2019s perihelion. Explanationist accounts are\nalso distinctively well-equipped to address inference patterns from\nnon-experimental sciences (Cleland 2011). \n\nThe problems faced by these approaches are similar to those affecting\nthe simplicity view. Agreement is still lacking on the nature of\nscientific explanation (see Woodward 2019) and it is not clear how far\nan explanationist variant of HD can go without a sound analysis of\nthat notion. Moreover, some critics have wondered why the relationship\nof confirmation should be affected by an explanatory connection with\nthe evidence per se (see Salmon 2001).\n\nThe above discussion does not display an exhaustive list (nor are the\nlisted options mutually exclusive, for that matter: see, e.g., Baker\n2003; also see Worrall 2010 for some overlapping implications in an\napplied setting of real practical value). And our sketched\npresentation hardly allows for any conclusive assessment. It does\nsuggest, however, that reports of the death of hypothetico-deductivism\n(see Earman 1992, 64, and Glymour 1980b) might have been exaggerated.\nFor all its difficulties, HD has proven fairly resilient at least as a\nbasic framework to elucidate some key aspects of how hypotheses can be\nconfirmed by the evidence (see Betz 2013, Gemes 2005, and Sprenger\n2011b for consonant points of view).\n",
