What are mass expressions?\n\n\nHow can we identify a class of mass expressions as distinct from a\nclass of count expressions? In order to do so, one may try to employ\nsyntactic criteria or semantic criteria. We present them in turn. As we\nshall see, only the syntactic criteria are satisfactory.\n1.1 Syntactic criteria\n\n\nAt the syntactic level, there are two viable positions concerning\nthe mass / count distinction: it applies at the level of nouns; or it\nonly applies at the level of noun phrases.\n\n\nThe first position is the traditional, dominant view (e.g., Weinreich\n1966; Krifka 1991; Gillon 1992). According to it, in a language\nlike English (or French, German, Greek, Italian, etc.), common nouns are\ndivided into two morphosyntactic subclasses, mass nouns and count\nnouns. A defining characteristic of mass nouns, like milk,\ngold, furniture, wisdom and love,\nis that they are invariable in grammatical number, while count nouns,\nlike rabbit, bottle, table, idea\nand set, can be used in the singular and in the plural.\nDepending on the language, this basic morphosyntactic difference\nbetween the two types of noun is supplemented by differences as to the\ndeterminers they can combine with. Thus, in English, mass nouns can be\nused with determiners like much and a lot of, but\nneither with one nor many. On the contrary, count\nnouns can be employed with numerals like one and determiners\nlike many, but not with much.\n\n\nHowever, as is well known, mass nouns (like milk) can often\nbe used as count nouns: You should take a hot milk with some\nhoney. And vice versa: You will find a lot of rabbit around\nhere. For this reason, several researchers have denied that the\nmass / count distinction applies at the level of nouns, and proposed\ninstead that it only applies at the level of noun phrases (e.g., Damourette\n& Pichon 1927; Pelletier 1975, 2012; Ware 1975). Under this\nview, at the level of nouns, there are only common nouns, but common\nnouns can be used in a mass way or in a count way depending on the\nmorphosyntactic environment they are put into. Mass determiners, like\nmuch or a little, lead to a mass use of the noun\n(much water, much table), while count determiners,\nlike a or two, lead to a count use (two\nwaters, two \ntables).[1]\n\n\nThe two positions seem to be viable (cf. Pelletier &\nSchubert 2003) and they have their respective proponents. For ease of\nexposition, we adopt the dominant view in the rest of\nthe\n entry.[2]\n1.2 Semantic criteria\n\n\nAt the semantic level, two properties have been proposed as being\ncharacteristic of mass nouns: cumulative reference and distributive\nreference. But as we shall see, cumulative reference is also a property\nof plurals, while distributive reference doesn\u2019t apply to all mass\nnouns.\n\n\nSince Quine (1960), it is generally accepted that mass nouns refer\ncumulatively. Consider a mass noun M. Suppose that we can\ntruly say of something x that This is M (with\nthis referring to x) and of something distinct,\ny, that This is M (with this now referring to\ny). Then in the same circumstance, we can also refer to\nx and y together, and say of x and y that\nThis is M. This property of mass nouns is called cumulative\nreference.  Plural count nouns also have the same property. Let\nNs be a plural count noun. If these are Ns and those are Ns,\nthen we can refer to these and those together, and say of all of them\nthat they are Ns.\n\n\nVarious authors have proposed that mass nouns also refer\ndistributively (e.g., Cheng 1973; ter Meulen 1981). Let M be a\nmass noun. Suppose that we can truly say of something x that This\nis M (with this referring to x). Then in the same\ncircumstance, for anything y that is part of x, we can also say of y\nthat This is M (with this now referring to y).\nHowever, with many mass nouns, the property doesn\u2019t apply when one\nconsiders parts that are small enough. Water is made of oxygen and\nhydrogen, but oxygen isn\u2019t water. And with mass nouns like\nfurniture or silverware, the problem appears even\nmore clearly, at the macroscopic level: a table is furniture, a leg of\nthe table is part of the table, but the leg isn\u2019t furniture.\nThus, the thesis that mass nouns refer distributively is mistaken\n(e.g., Gillon 1992; Nicolas 2002).\n\n\nA first attempt to defend the view would be as follows. Bunt (1985)\nand others have proposed that, although modern science is in conflict\nwith the claim that the mass noun water refers distributively,\nEnglish speakers use the noun as if it did. The problem with this\nsuggestion is that it cannot be falsified, since it puts aside the very\ncases that would do so. So it doesn\u2019t seem to be an empirical\nhypothesis and it doesn\u2019t appear to make any prediction. What benefit\nwould there be to add this claim to any theory?\n\n\nA better attempt would consist, in effect, in attributing a weaker\nproperty to mass nouns. As we will see in section\n2, an approach based on mereology may well, contrary to what is\nusually assumed, want to use a non-extensional mereology, where the\nnotion of part is defined in terms of the notion of sum. If\ndistributive reference were understood using such a notion of part, it\ncould avoid the problems mentioned here. There is nothing wrong with\nthat, but then, the property attributed to mass nouns would be much\nweaker than that originally advocated by its partisans (see Nicolas\n2002, chapter 3, for a proposal of this kind).  The claim made here is\nsimply that distributive reference, as usually conceived, is not a\nproperty of mass nouns.\n\n\nBut more generally, it seems that there are no necessary and\nsufficient semantic conditions that would specify what mass nouns are\nand what count nouns are (see Gillon 1992, Koslicki 1999, and Nicolas\n2002 for detailed arguments to this effect[3]; a contrario, see for\ninstance Landman 2011). A common noun that is mass in a language (like\nluggage in English) may be count in another (like\nbagage in French). The distinction between mass nouns and\ncount nouns should be drawn syntactically. A key feature of count nouns\nis that they admit the singular / plural contrast while mass nouns do\nnot. So languages that do not mark the singular / plural contrast could\nlack count nouns and all their common nouns function in a similar way\nas mass nouns do in English. This might the case of certain classifier\nlanguages, like Mandarin (Chierchia 1998,\n 2010).[4]\nAlternatively, the mass / count distinction could\njust fail to apply to such languages. The proper way to draw the mass /\ncount distinction across languages is still debated (see Doetjes 2012, Rothstein 2017, and Bale & Barner 2018 for cross-linguistic overviews).\n\n\nIn the rest of this entry, we examine how sentences containing mass\nnouns are interpreted, i.e., how their truth-conditions can be\nspecified. We consider several approaches to the semantics of mass\nnouns. Even though a given approach may turn out to be unsatisfactory,\nit is important to know in what precise respects it fails. For some of\nits key proposals may be retained in (or transposed to) a better,\noverall framework.\n2. The purely mereological approach\n\n\nWe first consider the purely mereological approach (Moravcsik 1973),\nwhich uses mereological sums as the denotata of mass nouns, and\ninterprets mass predication (e.g., This is water) in terms of\nparthood.\n\n\nTake the noun water. The view is that this noun denotes the\nsum of all the water that there is. The notion of sum involved here\ncan be characterized formally, as done in mereology (cf. Varzi 2016, Cotnoir & Varzi forthcoming).\nIntuitively, suppose there is some water in a bottle, a, and\nsome water in a cup, b. Then we can also refer to the water in\nthe bottle and the cup. This is a bigger portion of water, the sum of\na and b, noted a\u2228b (or\na+b). a is part of a\u2228b, and so\nis b. More generally, we can sum all the portions of water\ntogether. This is a very big portion of water, which is the denotation\nof the noun water. Mass predication is then interpreted in\nterms of these associated notions of sum and parthood:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2264 [M],\n\n\nwhere [\u2009\u00b7\u2009] is the denotation function,\n[this] is the sum of what is demonstrated and [M] is\nthe sum of all M.  For instance:\n\n\nThis is water is true\niff [this] \u2264 [water], the sum of all water.\n\n\n\nHowever, this quickly runs into a problem, since there are parts of\nwater (e.g., oxygen) that are too small to count as water. Water seems\nto have \u201cminimal parts\u201d, smallest parts that count as water. (As said\nin section 1.2, this is even clearer with mass nouns like\nfurniture.)\n\n\nParsons (1970, reprinted in 1979: 150) points out a related\ndifficulty, the \u2018WOOD = FURNITURE\u2019 problem. Suppose that\nall wood is used to make up furniture and all furniture is made of\nwood. Then it would seem that the sum of the wood is identical with the\nsum of the furniture. Therefore, all sentences of the form The wood\nP and The furniture P are predicted to have the same\ntruth-value, for any predicate P. Yet, it might well be that\nThe furniture is heterogeneous is true, intuitively, while\nThe wood is heterogeneous is false.\nRemark 1: The purely mereological approach is usually understood in\nterms of classical extensional mereology. However, such an approach\ndoesn\u2019t seem to require the full power of this theory. The notion of\nsum used could be the join operation \u2228 in a join semi-lattice.\nAnd the notion of parthood employed could be the order relation \u2264\ndefined in this way: x \u2264 y =def x \u2228 y =\ny. The notion of join semi-lattice is more general and far less\nconstrained than classical extensional\n mereology (see Moltmann 1997, ch. 1, for other criticisms of the mereological\nextensional view).\nRemark 2: Thus, against Parsons, one may well want to deny that the\n(sum or join of the) wood is identical to the (sum or join of the)\nfurniture. Indeed, if the furniture is broken, it ceases to exist,\nwhile the wood does not. This line of argumentation is adopted more\ngenerally by those who deny the identity of a ship and the wood it is\nmade of, of a man and its molecules, etc. (cf. Wasserman 2012).\nParsons\u2019 argument is based on a controversial metaphysical\nassumption, one that a semantics of mass nouns need not\n make.[5]\n(See Steen 2012, section 2.2 and\nsupplement 1, for other metaphysical considerations concerning the\npurely mereological approach.)\nRemark 3: Indeed, Moravcsik (1973) proposes to do something of this\nkind in order to avoid the problem of minimal parts. The idea is to\nassociate to any mass noun its own part-whole relation. Let M\nbe a mass noun, [M] the sum it denotes, and\n\u2264M the associated part-whole relation. The sentence\nThis is M is represented as: [this]\n\u2264M [M]. Then, the leg of a table isn\u2019t a furniture-part of the furniture, so the problem of minimal\nparts is avoided.\nRemark 4: However, this doesn\u2019t account for the validity of\nsyllogisms like the following (Burge 1972: 266\u2013267):\n\nThis is gold. Gold is metal. Therefore, this is metal.\n\nPresumably, it represents it as follows:\n\n[this] \u2264GOLD [gold] &\n[gold] \u2264METAL [metal] \u2192 \n[this] \u2264METAL [metal]\n\nThis is invalid, since only a uniform part-whole relation could\nguarantee\n transitivity.[6]\n\nRemark 5: The purely mereological approach faces yet another, very\ngeneral problem. One still needs a uniform framework for doing\nsemantics: for proper names, singular count nouns, plurals, mass nouns,\nadjectives, verbs, etc. This has to be set theory, or something as\npowerful like \u201cnon-singular\u201d or \u201cplural\u201d logic\n(see section 9).\n3. The purely set-theoretic approach\n\n\nBy contrast, the purely set-theoretic approach (Burge 1972; Grandy\n1973; Montague  1973[7])\ntreats\nmass nouns as ordinary predicates that denote\n sets[8].\nMass predication is interpreted as set\nmembership. For any mass noun M and predicate P:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2286 [M] Some M P is true iff [M] \u2229\n[P] \u2260 \u2205,\n\nwhere [this] is the set whose elements are what is\ndemonstrated, [M] is the set having for elements everything\nthat is M, [P] is the set having for elements\neverything that P.\n\n\nA difficulty for this approach is to\nspecify, for any mass noun M, what the \u201cportions of\nM\u201d are. This difficulty appears especially clearly with definite\ndescriptions, as in The gold on the table weighs fifty grams.\nIf the description the gold on the table denotes the set\nhaving for elements everything that is gold on the table, then how can\nwe evaluate the truth of the sentence? It would not do to give the sum\nof all weights (cf. Bunt 1985: 41). So it seems we must impose\nrestrictions on the elements of the set [the gold on the\ntable].[9]\n\nNow comes a second and crucial difficulty concerning identity over\ntime. Consider:\n\nThe clay that was on the desk on July 1st is identical\nwith the clay that was on the table on July 2nd.\n(Context of utterance: three solid bits of clay were on the desk on\nJuly 1st, and two solid bits of clay were on the table on\nJuly 2nd. Example inspired by Cartwright 1965.)\n\n\nWhich set could make [the clay that was on the desk on July\n1st] = [the clay that was on the table on July\n2nd] true? What about the set of all minimal parts of\nclay, i.e., the set of all the instances of clay that have no other\ninstance of clay as part?  However, with mass nouns like\ngarbage, it is not clear what the minimal parts would be\n(cf. Pelletier & Schubert 2003). And more crucially, one cannot\nexclude a priori the possibility that what a given mass noun\napplies to may be indefinitely divisible. So the semantics should not\nrequire mass nouns to have minimal parts (cf. Bunt 1985; Gillon 1992).\n(See section 9 for a solution to this problem\nwithin the framework of non-singular logic; see Steen 2012, section\n2.3, for various metaphysical considerations concerning the purely\nset-theoretic approach.)\n4. The mixed set-theoretic and mereological approach\n\n\nFrom what precedes, one may be tempted to draw the following\nlessons:\n\n Mass predication (as in This is water) should not be\nunderstood in terms of parthood, but in terms of set membership.\n The denotation of a mass noun M (the set whose elements\nare everything that is M) should be the join semi-lattice generated by\nthe sum or join operation on portions of\n M.[10]\n\n\n\nThis solves the problems encountered above by the purely\nmereological approach and the purely set-theoretic approach. Indeed,\nwhat precedes suggests that mass predication (to be M), like\ncount predication or adjectival predication, is well rendered in terms\nof set membership. The purely set-theoretic approach has problems with\ndefinite descriptions because it just uses sets, avoiding sums. But as\nwe saw earlier, mass nouns have the property of cumulative reference.\nIf there is some clay in two cups, then one can refer to all of the\nclay as the clay in the two cups. This suggests that portions of clay\ncan be summed, and that the set of portions of clay should have the\nstructure of a join semi-lattice. When this is guaranteed for any mass\nnoun M, the semantic value of definite descriptions can easily\nbe specified. The description the M that Q denotes the sum of\neverything that is some M that Q. It is such a sum that is weighted in\nThe gold on the table weighs fifty grams. And it is such a sum\nwhose identity over time is asserted in The clay that was on the\ndesk on July 1st is identical with the clay that was on the\n table on July 2nd. (Another treatment of identity over time is presented in \nsection 9.)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we arrive at the mixed set-theoretic and mereological\napproach:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2286\n[M]\nSome M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P]\n\u2260 \u2205\nThe M (that Q) P is true iff [the M (that Q)]\n\u2286 [P],\n\nwhere [this] is the set having for sole member the sum of\nwhat is demonstrated, [M] is the set of everything that is M\n(a join semi-lattice), [the M (that Q)] is the\nset having for sole member the sum of everything that is some M (that\nQ), [P] is the set having for members everything that P.\n\n\nThis\noffers a simple way to accommodate the hindsights of the set-theoretic\nand mereological approaches, while avoiding the previous pitfalls. A\ndecisive advantage of this view over the purely mereological one is\nthat the overall framework for doing semantics remains the usual one,\nset theory. Gillon (1992) and Nicolas (2010) can be seen as instances\nof such a mixed view,[11] with an additional component, namely\n\u201caggregations\u201d or \u201ccoverings\u201d\n(see section 8 below).\n5. Negation\n\n\nHowever, a difficulty appears with negation (Roeper 1983;\nL\u00f8nning 1987; Higginbotham 1994). Consider a positive sentence\nof the form The M P and its negation The M\nnot P, where M is a mass noun and P a\npredicate. For instance: The gold is in the safe and The\ngold is not in the safe. Imagine that the universe of discourse\ncontains only two bits of gold, a and b, and their\nsum a\u2228b. Then under the mixed view, [gold] =\n{a, b, a\u2228b}, [the gold] =\n{a\u2228b}. Suppose further that only a is in the\nsafe: [in the safe] = {a}. Given what we said\nin section 4:\n\nThe gold is in the safe is true iff [the gold]\n\u2286 [in the safe]\n\nSo the sentence is predicted to be false.\n\n\nNow, it seems plausible that the semantics should validate the\nfollowing equivalence: The M not P is true iff The M\nP is false. Then, the sentence The gold is not in the\nsafe is predicted to be true. This is a problem for the mixed\napproach developed so far, since one would like to ascribe the same\nstatus to the positive sentence and its negation. Either because both\nsentences are taken to be false. Or because both are judged\ninapplicable in the circumstance, being as it were partly true and\npartly false.\n\n\nConsider also noun phrases of the form the M that P and\nthe M that not P. For instance: the gold that is in the\nsafe and the gold that is not in the safe. Here,\nintuitions are very clear: the first noun phrase designates the solid\nbit of gold a, while the second designates b. However, under the mixed\napproach, The gold is not in the safe is true. This means that\na+b (the gold) is in the denotation of is not in the safe. So\nit may seem that a+b is also in the denotation of gold that is not\nin the safe and in that of the gold that is not in the\nsafe, contradicting speakers\u2019 intuitions.\n\n\nHow can we avoid these difficulties? Roeper (1983), L\u00f8nning\n(1987) and Higginbotham (1994) propose that the solution lies in\ndefining predication and negation in a certain way within a\nBoolean\n algebra.[12]\nThey consider only\ncases where predicates (mass nouns included) are\n\u201chomogeneous\u201d, like above. Following ter Meulen (1981), a\npredicate is said to be homogeneous if it applies both cumulatively and\ndistributively. Predicates like gold and in the safe\nmay indeed seem to apply distributively and cumulatively, if we stay at\nthe macroscopic level for gold. In this approach, mass nouns\nand predicates denote elements in a certain Boolean algebra,\n(B,\u2264,\u2228,\u22270,1). \u2264 is the order (or parthood)\nrelation. \u2228 is the join (or sum) operation. \u2227 is the meet\n(or intersection) operation. 0 is the smallest element. 1 is the\nlargest element. As in any Boolean algebra, every element x has a\nBoolean complement, noted \u2212x (cf. Monk 2018).\n\n\nPredication is understood in terms of Boolean intersection:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2227  [M]\n= [this] iff [this] \u2264 [M]\nThe M P is true iff [M] \u2227 [P] =\n[M] iff [M] \u2264 [P]\nSome M P is true iff [M] \u2227 [P]\n\u2260 0,\n\nwhere [this] is the join of what is demonstrated,\n[M] is join of everything that is M, and [P] is the\njoin of everything that P.\n\n\nAnd negation is defined in terms of\nBoolean complement: [not P] =\n\u2212[P]. So The M not P is true iff\n[M] \u2264 [not P] = \u2212[P].\nApplying this, both The gold is in the safe and The\ngold is not in the safe are predicted to be false.\nIndeed, in the situation imagined, the universe of discourse contains\nonly two bits of gold, a and b, and their join a\u2228b. So\n[gold] = a\u2228b = 1, [is in the safe] = a,\n[is not in the safe] = \u2212a =\n b.[13]\n\n\nThe denotation of complex noun phrases is also built through Boolean\nintersection: [M that P] = [M] \u2227 [P]. So [gold that is in the safe] = [gold]\u2227[is\nin the safe] = (a\u2228b)\u2227a\n= a. And [gold that is not in the safe] = (a\u2228b)\u2227b\n= b.\nRemark 1: Under this approach, the whole universe of discourse (for\nmass nouns and their predicates) is specified by a single Boolean\nalgebra, with uniformly defined join (sum), meet (intersection), and\norder (parthood). Predication is defined in terms of Boolean\nintersection (or equivalently, order or parthood in the case of\ndefinite subjects). This works with mass nouns and predicates that are\nhomogeneous (i.e., refer distributively and cumulatively). But mass\nnouns like furniture are clearly not homogeneous. And a\npredicate like made by John isn\u2019t homogeneous either.\nWhen something is made by John (e.g., a piece of furniture), it\ndoesn\u2019t imply that any part of it (e.g., some wood used to make it\nup) is also made by John. For the reasons given in section 2, the\nBoolean approach may ascribe incorrect truth-conditions to sentences\nlike This is furniture, Some furniture is made by\nJohn, and The furniture is made by John. For instance,\n[this] \u2264 [furniture] does not guarantee that\nwhat is demonstrated is furniture, since a piece of wood may be a part\nof a piece of furniture without being furniture. So there are mass\nnouns and predicates to which the approach doesn\u2019t seem to apply,\neven though the same difficulties with negation appear with them. If in\nthe examples above we replace gold by furniture and\nin the safe by made by John, we meet the same\nproblems with negation. (If there are two pieces of furniture, only one\nof which is made by John, is it true or false that The furniture is\nmade by John?) So an appropriate solution had better not be tied\nto the assumption of\n homogeneity.[14]\nRemark 2: Indeed, the proposed treatment of negation can be adapted\nwithin the mixed approach. The basic idea is that if something x P and\nsomething y not P, then x and y do not overlap (have no part in common,\nhave 0 as intersection). So, within the mixed view, one may define\n[not P] as the set comprising anything that does not overlap\n\u2228[P], the sum of everything that P. This solves the\nproblems above, without requiring homogeneity.\nRemark 3: However, defining negation in terms of Boolean complement\nor non-overlap doesn\u2019t work with all predicates. Consider the\nadjective cheap. Fix the context of speech so that what counts\nas cheap is specified and what counts as not cheap is also specified.\nThe pieces of furniture a and b may each count as cheap, while together\nthey (a\u2228b) count as not cheap. So non-overlap isn\u2019t\nsatisfied here: something not cheap overlaps with something cheap.\nCheap is a vague predicate. But the same phenomenon is\nobserved with an exact predicate like costs fifty euros: a and\nb may each cost fifty euros, while together they don\u2019t, costing\nninety euros, for instance. So non-overlap should not be required. In\ngeneral, [not P] cannot be defined in terms of [P].\nInstead, it seems that [P] and [not P] should be\nseparately specified. (This is done in many approaches to\nvagueness.)\nRemark 4: The same difficulties also appear with plurals, as we can\nsee if we replace gold by pieces of furniture and\nin the safe by made by John in the examples above.\nThere is no agreement on what the proper treatment of negated plural\nsentences is. Still, a popular view is the following (Krifka 1996;\nL\u00f6bner 2000; see Breheny 2005 a contrario). Sentences like The\npieces of furniture are in the safe and The pieces of\nfurniture are not in the safe make a presupposition of\n\u201cindivisibility\u201d: they can be used felicitously only if all\nthe pieces of furniture are in safe or if none\n is.[15]\nThe same could be proposed concerning mass\nnouns. In any case, a unified treatment of negation would be welcome,\ngiven that negation seems to create the same basic problem with mass\nnouns and with plurals.\nRemark 5: But the problem is even more general, since it also\nappears with subjects that are count and singular, like table.\nIs the table in the living-room, when one half of it is, while the\nother half is in the bedroom? The application of a predicate to an\nentity (or the application of the negated predicate) seems to be often\nsensitive to the part structure of the entity (L\u00f6bner 2000;\nCorblin 2008). More work on this is needed to understand how\npredication and negation work in connection to part-structure.\n6. Quantifiers\n\n\nWhat is the semantics of quantifiers combining with mass nouns:\nsome, all, no, only, little, much, most, two liters\nof\u2026? Higginbotham and May (1981) propose that the semantics\nof quantifiers combining with count nouns (some, all, no, only,\nfew, many, most, two\u2026) can be captured within the framework\nof generalized quantification. Inspired by Roeper (1983) and\nL\u00f8nning (1987), Higginbotham (1994) applies similar ideas to the\ncase of mass nouns. His proposals are made in the Boolean approach\ncriticized in the last section. So we transpose them directly into the\nmixed set-theoretic and mereological framework. This also has the\nadvantage that the same framework is used for count quantifiers and\nmass quantifiers.\n\n\nWe consider sentences of the form Q M P, where Q\nis a quantifier, M a mass noun and P a predicate.\n[M] is the denotation of the mass noun, i.e., the set that has\nfor members everything that is M (a join semi-lattice). [P] is\nthe set that has for members everything that P. Using set-theoretic intersection \u2229, one may propose:\n\nSome M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] \u2260 \u2205\nAll M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] =\n[M][16]\nNo M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] =\n\u2205\nOnly M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] =\n[P]\n\nThis applies to sentences like Some / All / No / Only gold was\nstolen.\n\n\nWith the other quantifiers (little, much,\nmost, two liters of\u2026), one seems to say\nsomething about the quantity of M (little gold) or intensity\nof M (little wisdom). Let us suppose that a mass noun\nM has an associated function, \u03bc, that measures quantity or\nintensity. We focus here on mass nouns that apply to concrete entities,\nlike water or furniture (see section 10 for\n\u201cabstract\u201d mass nouns). In that case, it is handy (though\nperhaps not necessary) to suppose that \u03bc is monotonic:\n\nx \u2264 y \u2192 \u03bc(x) \u2264 \u03bc(y)\n\nand additive (if x and y don\u2019t overlap, the measure of their sum is\nthe sum of their measures):\n\n\u00ac\u2203z (z \u2264 x & z \u2264 y) \u2192\n \u03bc(x\u2228y) =\n\u03bc(x) + \u03bc(y)\n\n(The measure function \u03bc is associated to a certain mass noun\nM. But of course, some mass nouns may share the same measure\nfunction. And with a single mass noun M, different measure\nfunctions may perhaps be used, in different contexts, to measure the\n\u201cquantity of M\u201d that is relevant in the context.)\n\n\nOne can also define the measure of a set E:\n\n\u03bc(E) =def \u03bc(\u2228E),\n\nwhere \u2228E is the sum (or join) of the elements of E.\n\n\nWith this in hand, the meanings of little, much\nand most can be specified as follows, the numerical values\np, q, r and s being specified\ncontextually when a sentence is uttered:\n\nLittle1 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2264 p\nLittle2 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2264 r*\u03bc([M])\nMuch1 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2265 q\nMuch2 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2265 s*\u03bc([M])\nMost M P is true iff \u03bc([M] \u2229 [P])\n\u2265 \u03bc([M]) / 2\nTwo liters of M P is true iff \u03bc([M] \u2229\n[P]) = 2\nwith a function \u03bc measuring in liters\n\nAbove, little and much are given two meanings, an\n\u201cabsolute\u201d one and a \u201cproportional\u201d one. Thus,\na sentence like Much gold was stolen may mean that:\n\n\nThe stolen gold was a large quantity of gold (absolute\ninterpretation):\n\u03bc([M] \u2229 [P]) \u2265 q, where q is specified contextually.\n\n\nThe stolen gold was a great proportion of the gold\n(proportional\n interpretation):[17]\n\u03bc([M] \u2229 [P]) \u2265 s*\u03bc([M]), where s is specified contextually.\n\n\nRemark 1: What precedes allows one to characterize\nthe meaning(s) of the various mass quantifiers. But of course, it\nleaves room for improvement concerning the specific meanings\nattributed. For instance, Solt (2009) argues in favor of a different\ncondition for the quantifier\nmost.\nRemark 2: In the case of the count quantifiers few and\nmany, there is evidence that each quantifier is really\nambiguous between two interpretations, the absolute one and the\nproportional one (Partee 1989). It remains to be seen whether there is\nsimilar evidence in the case of little and much.\nRemark 3: Adding negation to this picture creates the same\ndifficulties as we saw above in the case of definites. In certain\ncases, [not P] can be defined in terms of [P] and\nnon-overlap. But in general, [P] and [not P] should\nbe separately specified.\n7. Logical relations\n\n\nIn what precedes, we have looked at the semantics of various kinds\nof sentences where mass nouns appear. But we haven\u2019t considered whether\nthere are logical relations between such sentences, i.e., whether the\nsemantics makes up for an adequate logic of mass nouns. This is the\ntopic of this section. An appropriate semantics for mass nouns should\nguarantee things like what follows. (For a more detailed discussion,\nsee Pelletier & Schubert 2003: 63\u201374.)\n\n\nExistential generalization: there are many sentences whose truth\nentails the truth of an existential generalization. For instance:\n\nThe wine is on the table. So some wine is on the table.\n\nUniversal instantiation: as mentioned in section 2, this kind of\nreasoning also seems to be valid:\n\nThis is gold. All gold is metal. Therefore, this is\nmetal.\n\nAlso, sentences like the following should come out as always true,\ngiven the meanings of the words involved: All gold is gold.\nAnd in any situation in which there is some gold in Zurich, this should\nalso be true: The gold in Zurich is gold.\n\n\nMass nouns can also be used in generic sentences, which express\ngeneralizations: Gold is metal. So one would need a semantics\nfor generic sentences to check, for instance, if this reasoning is\nvalidated: This is gold. Gold is metal. Therefore, this is\nmetal. However, the semantics of genericity is a vast topic, which\nfalls out of the scope of this entry (see also note 7).\n\n\nFinally, mass nouns can also be used as count nouns: Gold is a\nmetal. So a full-blown semantics, covering both mass nouns and\ncount nouns, should be able to validate syllogisms like the following,\nwhich involve mass and count uses of a mass noun: This is gold.\nGold is a metal. Therefore, this is a metal.\n\n\nFor illustration, let us see how the mixed set-theoretic and\nmereological framework developed in sections 4 and 6 handles some of\nthese cases. According to section 4:\n\nThe wine is on the table is true iff [the wine]\n\u2286 [on the table],\n\nwhere [the wine] denotes the\nsum of the wine, and [on the table] denotes the set containing\neverything that is on the table.\n\nSome wine is on the table is true iff [wine]\n\u2229 [on the table] \u2260 \u2205,\n\nwhere [wine] is the set containing everything that is wine (a\njoin semi-lattice).\n\n\nSince [wine] is the join semi-lattice\ncontaining everything that is wine, it contains in particular the sum\nof the wine. So, given how the semantics is set-up, the truth\nof The wine is one the table guarantees that of Some wine\nis on the table.\n\n\nFor a different case, according to sections 4 and 6:\n\nThis is gold is true iff [this] \u2286\n[gold]\nAll gold is metal is true iff [gold] \u2229\n[metal] = [gold]\n\nSo the truth of This is gold and All gold is metal\nguarantees that [this] \u2286 [metal] and so that\nThis is metal is true.\n8. Collective and non-collective construals, coverings\n\n\nAccording to Gillon (1992), a sentence containing a mass noun may\nreceive so-called \u201ccollective\u201d and\n\u201cdistributive\u201d construals, modulo the meaning of the\nparticular lexical items composing the sentence, context of speech and\nknowledge of the world. (Sentences containing plurals also receive such\nconstruals. This is well documented by Gillon (1992, 1996) and\nSchwarzschild (1996). This may be confirmed by replacing mass nouns\nwith plurals in the examples we give below.)\n\n\nTake the following sentence: This silverware costs a hundred\neuros. The sentence may be true if the silverware costs,\naltogether, a hundred euros: this is the collective construal of the\nsentence. It may be true if each piece of silverware, by itself, costs\na hundred euros: this is the distributive construal. It may also be\ntrue if the silverware demonstrated consists in two sets of silverware,\neach set of silverware costing, by itself, a hundred euros: this may be\ncalled an \u201cintermediate\u201d construal.\n\n\nA partly similar range of construals is observed with a mass noun\nlike wine: This wine costs a hundred euros. A\ncollective construal would assert that the wine, altogether, costs a\nhundred euros. A non-collective construal may be obtained, for\ninstance, when the wine demonstrated consists of two cases of wine. The\nspeaker could then assert that each case of wine costs a hundred euros.\nWhat about a distributive construal of the sentence? In fact, this\nnotion does not apply in this case, since a mass noun like\nwine has no linguistically specified minimal part.\n\n\nTherefore, the distinction that concerns all mass nouns is not that\nbetween collective and distributive construals (nor that between\ncollective, distributive and intermediate readings), but rather, that\nbetween collective and non-collective construals. What happens is that,\nin the specific case of mass nouns like silverware, one can\nidentify, among the non-collective construals, one reading that may be\ncalled distributive and other readings that may be called\nintermediate.\n\n\nThe specific meanings of the verbal expression and its arguments,\ncombined with knowledge of the world and context of speech, may render\na type of construal more, or less, plausible. In particular,\nnon-collective, \u201cintermediate\u201d construals may be harder to\nget than the collective reading, or than the \u201cdistributive\u201d\nreading if there is one. Such construals require specific information\nabout the context in order to become available. They are often easier\nto get when the verb has several arguments, as in the following example\ndue to Gillon (1992): This fruit was wrapped in that paper. A\nnon-collective, \u201cintermediate\u201d construal with respect to\nits first argument (this fruit) would be one where there are\nseveral pieces of paper, each enclosing several pieces of fruit.\n\n\nIn the examples we have given so far (as well as in those considered\nby Gillon), non-collective construals always correspond to partitions\nof the denotation of the mass noun phrase. However, some\ninterpretations correspond to a more general notion, that of a\n\u201ccovering\u201d: a set X is a covering of a set Y just in case\nthe sum of the elements of X is identical with the sum of the elements\nof\n Y.[18]\nThus, with This\nlivestock carried that furniture, it may be that some pieces of\nfurniture were repeatedly part of the furniture carried by some of the\nlivestock. The relation of carrying thus applies between elements of a\ncovering of [this livestock] and elements of a covering of\n[that furniture]. So it seems that the semantics of mass nouns\nshould leave room, not only for partitions, but also for all kinds\nof\n coverings.[19]\n\n\nLet us now see how Gillon (1992, 1996, 2012) accounts for these\ndata. We follow him quite closely, but introduce a few technical\nmodifications to ensure that everything works.\n\n\nThe denotation of a mass noun M is the set [M]\nthat has for elements everything that is M (a join semi-lattice). This\nis needed in order to specify correctly the truth-conditions of\n This is M:[20]\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2286\n[M],\n\nwhere [this] is the set having for sole member the sum of\nwhat is demonstrated.\n\n\nA set Y is an M-covering of a\nset Z just in case these two conditions are satisfied:\n\nY is a subset of [M]: Y \u2286\n[M].\nThe sum of the elements of Y is identical to the sum of the\nelements of Z.\n\n\n\nThe interpretation of sentences like the following depends on the\nchoice of an M-covering of the\nnoun\u2019s\n denotation.[21]\nRelative to this\nchoice of covering C:\n\nThe M P is true iff C \u2286 [P]\nSome M P is true iff C \u2229 [P] \u2260\n\u2205\nAll M P is true iff C \u2229 [P] = C\n\nGillon doesn\u2019t extend his account to other quantified\nstatements. However, this is easily done, following section 6. Thus,\none may define the measure of a set E:\n\n\u03bc(E) =def \u03bc(\u2228E),\n\nwhere \u2228E is the sum of the\nelements of E.\n\n\nAnd propose that:\n\nMost M P is true iff \u03bc(C \u2229 [P]) \u2265\n\u03bc(C) / 2\n\nAnd similarly for the other quantifiers whose interpretation involve\na measure.\nRemark: For Gillon, each choice\nof covering determines a specific interpretation of the sentence. The\nsentence is thus many-ways ambiguous. Schwarzschild (1996) offers a\ndetailed defense for a similar position in the case of plurals (see also Champollion 2017). But\nthe view also has opponents, like Lasersohn (1995). Among the\nalternatives, one could propose that a sentence of the form The M\nP is true just in case there exists a covering C of\n[M] such that C \u2286 [P]. The sentence\nwouldn\u2019t be ambiguous but indeterminate with respect to coverings. A\nproblem is that this wouldn\u2019t predict the distributive / collective\nambiguity, which does seem real (see Gillon 1992 for evidence).\n9. Non-singular terms\n\n\nThere are many similarities between the semantics of mass nouns and\nplurals, cf. sections 5, 6, and 8. Also, at a very intuitive level, if\nthere are eight pieces of silverware on the table, then the speaker\nseems to refer to eight things at once when he says: The silverware\nthat is on the table comes from Italy. If this intuition is taken\nseriously, then a mass noun isn\u2019t a singular term. Rather, it is a\nnon-singular term that may refer to one or several things at once.\n\n\nNicolas (2008) puts forwards a semantics of mass nouns that does\njustice to this\n intuition (see Laycock (2006), Cocchiarella (2009) and McKay (2016) for related proposals).\nIt is cashed out in \u201cnon-singular\u201d or \u201cplural\u201d\nlogic. In usual logic frameworks, like predicate logic, constants and\nvariables are singular in the following sense. Under any\ninterpretation, a constant is interpreted as one individual, and under\nany assignment, a variable is interpreted as one individual. By\ncontrast, non-singular or plural logic possesses singular and\nnon-singular constants and variables. Under any interpretation and\nvariable assignment, a non-singular term (a constant or a variable) may\nbe interpreted as one or more individuals in the domain of\ninterpretation. In particular, a formula consisting of a predicate\nwhose argument is a non-singular constant is true just in case the\nconstant is interpreted as one or more individuals that jointly satisfy\nthe predicate (cf. Linnebo\n 2017[22]).\nRemark: The claim is not that mass nouns are plurals. It is that\nmass nouns and plurals share a common property, namely the ability to\nrefer non-singularly, to one or several things at once.\n\nThe resulting semantics has the following features:\n\nAxioms guaranteeing the existence of mereological sums are\nreplaced by non-singular or plural reference. (Cf. also Nicolas\n2009, 2017.)\n Combined with a generalized notion of covering, this allows a\ntreatment of identity statements different from that offered by the\nmixed set-theoretic and mereological approach (where what remains\nidentical over time is a certain mereological sum).\n\n\nImagine that three solid bits of clay, the as, were on the\ndesk on July 1st, and two solid bits of clay, the bs, were\non the table on July 2nd. Now consider the statement:\n\nThe clay that was on the desk on July 1st is identical\nwith the clay that was on the table on July\n2nd.\n\nAccording to Nicolas (2008), the sentence is true when a common\nnon-singular covering can be chosen for the as and the\nbs.[23]\nThis means that there are some\nsmall bits of clay, each of which has retained its identity over time.\nOn July 1st, these bits of clay were so arranged that they\nmade up the as (i.e., they were a covering of the as). On July\n2nd, they were arranged differently, in such a way that they\nmade up the bs. This doesn\u2019t require the existence of minimal parts of\nclay. It only requires the existence of a common division of the as and\nthe bs into certain bits of clay. (See Steen 2012, section 2.4, for\nmetaphysical considerations concerning the non-singularist or pluralist\napproach.)\n10. Abstract mass nouns\n\n\n\u201cAbstract\u201d nouns like sadness and\nwisdom and \u201cconcrete\u201d nouns like water\nand furniture all belong to the morphosyntactic class of mass\nnouns. However, semantics for mass nouns have generally focused on\nconcrete terms, i.e., terms that apply to concrete entities. This raises\nan important question: are abstract mass nouns a separate species of\nmass nouns, with their own semantic properties? Or can a general\naccount be proposed, which would work both for concrete mass nouns and\nabstract ones?\n\n\nNicolas (2004, 2010) shows that a general account of the semantics\nof mass nouns can indeed be proposed, provided one takes a more general\nstance than when focusing on concrete mass nouns alone (see also Grimm 2014). Several issues\narise.\n\n\nReference: concrete common nouns can be used in definite\ndescriptions, where they seem to refer to entities of various types. Do\nabstract mass nouns refer to something when they are used in definite\ndescriptions? And if so, what do they refer to? Consider sentences like\nthese: Julie\u2019s wisdom attracted Tom. Julie\u2019s love for Tom lasted\nseveral years. Nicolas proposes that their subjects, which are\nheaded by abstract mass nouns, do refer (or make as if to refer) to\ninstances of properties or relations, thereby introducing these as\nreferents in the\n discourse (Moltmann 2007 proposes something similar).\nHe argues that this provides the most unified explanation of the\nvarious uses of abstract mass nouns.\n\n\nNominalization: many abstract mass nouns are derived from an\nadjective or verb. What is the semantic effect of nominalization?\nNicolas proposes that its intuitive effect, namely reification, a\n\u201csomething-from-nothing transformation\u201d, is adequately captured by\nmeaning postulates. Thus, a meaning postulate relates the meanings of\nthe mass noun love and the verb to love. It ensures\nthat an instance of love from John towards Mary exists if and only if\nJohn loves Mary.\n\n\nDistributive, collective, and intermediate construals: sentences\nwith concrete mass nouns or plurals may receive so-called distributive,\ncollective, and intermediate construals (cf. section 8 above). Is it\nalso the case with abstract mass nouns? Nicolas (2010) suggests that\nthis is so. Take the sentence The strength of these men is\nimpressive, uttered in a context where two strong teams are\ncompeting. The sentence can assert that the strength of each team is\nimpressive. This corresponds to a construal which is neither\ndistributive (the strength of each man is impressive), nor collective\n(the strength of the men all together is impressive), but intermediate\nbetween distributive and collective. Nicolas shows that these\nconstruals can be accounted for by Gillon\u2019s (1996) rule for the\ninterpretation of complex noun phrases containing a prepositional\nphrase.\n\n\nOverall, then, it seems that a unified semantics can be specified\nfor all mass nouns.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Bale, A. &amp; D.
