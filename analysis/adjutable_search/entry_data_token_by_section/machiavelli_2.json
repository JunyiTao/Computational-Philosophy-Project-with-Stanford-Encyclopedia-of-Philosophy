    "main_text": "Power, Virt\u00f9, and Fortune\n3. Power, Virt\u00f9, and Fortune\n\nMachiavelli presents to his readers a vision of political rule\nallegedly purged of extraneous moralizing influences and fully aware\nof the foundations of politics in the effective exercise of power. The\nmethods for achieving obedience are varied and depend heavily upon the\nforesight that the prince exercises. Hence, the successful ruler needs\nspecial training. The term that best captures Machiavelli\u2019s\nvision of skill that must be learned in order to engage successfully\nin power politics is virt\u00f9. While the Italian word\nwould normally be translated into English as \u201cvirtue\u201d, and\nwould ordinarily convey the conventional connotation of moral\ngoodness, Machiavelli obviously means something very different when he\nrefers to the virt\u00f9 of the prince. In particular,\nMachiavelli employs the concept of virt\u00f9 to refer to\nthe range of personal qualities that the prince will find it necessary\nto acquire in order to \u201cmaintain his state\u201d and to\n\u201cachieve great things\u201d, the two standard markers of power\nfor him. This makes it brutally clear there can be no equivalence\nbetween the conventional virtues and Machiavellian\nvirt\u00f9. Machiavelli\u2019s sense of what it is to be a\nperson of virt\u00f9 can thus be summarized by his\nrecommendation that the prince above all else must possess a\n\u201cflexible disposition\u201d. That ruler is best suited for\noffice, on Machiavelli\u2019s account, who is capable of varying\nher/his conduct from good to evil and back again \u201cas fortune and\ncircumstances dictate\u201d (Prince CW 66; see Nederman and\nBogiaris 2018).\n\nNot coincidentally, Machiavelli also uses the term\nvirt\u00f9 in his book The Art of War in order to\ndescribe the strategic prowess of the general who adapts to different\nbattlefield conditions as the situation dictates. Machiavelli sees\npolitics to be a sort of a battlefield on a different scale. Hence,\nthe prince just like the general needs to be in possession of\nvirt\u00f9, that is, to know which strategies and\ntechniques are appropriate to what particular circumstances (Wood\n1967). Thus, virt\u00f9 winds up being closely connected to\nMachiavelli\u2019s notion of the power. The ruler of\nvirt\u00f9 is bound to be competent in the application of\npower; to possess virt\u00f9 is indeed to have mastered all\nthe rules connected with the effective application of power.\nVirt\u00f9 is to power politics what conventional virtue is\nto those thinkers who suppose that moral goodness is sufficient to be\na legitimate ruler: it is the touchstone of political efficacy.\n\nWhat is the conceptual link between virt\u00f9 and the\neffective exercise of power for Machiavelli? The answer lies with\nanother central Machiavellian concept, Fortuna (usually\ntranslated as \u201cfortune\u201d). Fortuna is the enemy of\npolitical order, the ultimate threat to the safety and security of the\nstate. Machiavelli\u2019s use of the concept has been widely debated\nwithout a very satisfactory resolution. Suffice it to say that, as\nwith virt\u00f9, Fortuna is employed by him in a\ndistinctive way. Where conventional representations treated\nFortuna as a mostly benign, if fickle, goddess, who is the\nsource of human goods as well as evils, Machiavelli\u2019s fortune is\na malevolent and uncompromising fount of human misery, affliction, and\ndisaster. While human Fortuna may be responsible for such\nsuccess as human beings achieve, no man can act effectively when\ndirectly opposed by the Goddess (Discourses CW\n407\u2013408).\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s most famous discussion of Fortuna occurs\nin Chapter 25 of The Prince, in which he proposes two\nanalogies for understanding the human situation in the face of events.\nInitially, he asserts that fortune resembles\n\none of our destructive rivers which, when it is angry, turns the\nplains into lakes, throws down the trees and buildings, takes earth\nfrom one spot, puts it in another; everyone flees before the flood;\neveryone yields to its fury and nowhere can repel it.\n\n\nYet the furor of a raging river does not mean that its depredations\nare beyond human control: before the rains come, it is possible to\ntake precautions to divert the worst consequences of the natural\nelements. \u201cThe same things happen about Fortuna\u201d,\nMachiavelli observes,\n\nShe shows her power where virt\u00f9 and wisdom do not\nprepare to resist her and directs her fury where she knows that no\ndykes or embankments are ready to hold her. (Prince CW 90)\n\n\nFortune may be resisted by human beings, but only in those\ncircumstances where \u201cvirt\u00f9 and wisdom\u201d\nhave already prepared for her inevitable arrival.\n\nMachiavelli reinforces the association of Fortuna with the\nblind strength of nature by explaining that political success depends\nupon appreciation of the operational principles of Fortuna.\nHis own experience has taught him that\n\nit is better to be impetuous than cautious, because Fortuna\nis a woman and it is necessary, in order to keep her under, to beat\nand maul her.\n\n\nIn other words, Fortuna demands a violent response of those\nwho would control her. \u201cShe more often lets herself be overcome\nby men using such methods than by those who proceed coldly\u201d,\nMachiavelli continues, \u201ctherefore always, like a woman, she is\nthe friend of young men, because they are less cautious, more\nspirited, and with more boldness master her\u201d (Prince CW\n92). The wanton behavior of Fortuna demands an aggressive,\neven violent response, lest she take advantage of those men who are\ntoo retiring or \u201ceffeminate\u201d to dominate her.\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s remarks point toward several salient conclusions\nabout Fortuna and her place in his intellectual universe.\nThroughout his corpus, Fortuna is depicted as a primal source\nof violence (especially as directed against humanity) and as\nantithetical to reason. Thus, Machiavelli realizes that only\npreparation to pose an extreme response to the vicissitudes of\nFortuna will ensure victory against her. This is what\nvirt\u00f9 provides: the ability to respond to fortune at\nany time and in any way that is necessary.\n",
