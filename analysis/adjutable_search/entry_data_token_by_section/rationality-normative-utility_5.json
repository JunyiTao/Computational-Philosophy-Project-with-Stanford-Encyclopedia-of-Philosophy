    "main_text": "Arguments for Expected Utility Theory || Representation Theorems\n2.2 Representation Theorems\n \n\nA second type of argument for expected utility theory relies on\nso-called representation theorems. We follow Zynda\u2019s (2000) formulation\nof this argument\u2014slightly modified to reflect the role of\nutilities as well as probabilities. The argument has three\npremises:\n\nThe Rationality Condition. The axioms of expected\nutility theory are the axioms of rational preference.\n\nRepresentability. If a person\u2019s preferences obey the\naxioms of expected utility theory, then she can be represented as\nhaving degrees of belief that obey the laws of the probability\ncalculus [and a utility function such that she prefers acts with\nhigher expected utility].\n\nThe Reality Condition. If a person can be\nrepresented as having degrees of belief that obey the probability\ncalculus [and a utility function such that she prefers acts with higher\nexpected utility], then the person really has degrees of belief that\nobey the laws of the probability calculus [and really does prefer acts\nwith higher expected utility].\n\n\nThese premises entail the following conclusion.\n\n\nIf a person [fails to prefer acts with higher expected utility], then\nthat person violates at least one of the axioms of rational\npreference.\n\n\nIf the premises are true, the argument shows that there is something\nwrong with people whose preferences are at odds with expected utility\ntheory\u2014they violate the axioms of rational preference. Let\nus consider each of the premises in greater detail, beginning with the\nkey premise, Representability.\n\n\nA probability function and a utility function together\nrepresent a set of preferences just in case the following\nformula holds for all values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in the domain\nof the preference relation\n\n\\[\nEU(A) \\gt EU(B) \\text{ if and only if } A \\text{ is preferred to } B.\n\\]\n\n\n\nMathematical proofs of Representability are called\nrepresentation theorems. Section 2.1 surveys three of\nthe most influential representation theorems, each of which relies on a\ndifferent set of axioms.\n\n\nNo matter which set of axioms we use, the Rationality Condition is\ncontroversial. In some cases, preferences that seem rationally\npermissible\u2014perhaps even rationally required\u2014violate the\naxioms of expected utility theory. Section 3 discusses such cases\nin detail.\n\n\nThe Reality Condition is also controversial. Hampton (1994), Zynda\n(2000), and Meacham and Weisberg (2011) all point out that to be\nrepresentable using a probability and utility function is not\nto have a probability and utility function. After all,\nan agent who can be represented as an expected utility maximizer with\ndegrees of belief that obey the probability calculus, can also be\nrepresented as someone who fails to maximize expected utility with\ndegrees of belief that violate the probability calculus. \nWhy think the expected utility representation is the right one?\n\n\nThere are several options. Perhaps the defender of\nrepresentation theorems can stipulate that what it is to have\nparticular degrees of belief and utilities is just to have the\ncorresponding preferences. The main challenge for defenders of\nthis response is to explain why representations in terms of expected\nutility are explanatorily useful, and why they are better than\nalternative representations. Or perhaps probabilities and utilities are\na good cleaned-up theoretical substitutes for our folk notions of\nbelief and desire\u2014precise scientific substitutes for our folk\nconcepts. Meacham and Weisberg challenge this response, arguing\nthat probabilities and utilities are poor stand-ins for our folk\nnotions. A third possibility, suggested by Zynda, is that facts\nabout degrees of belief are made true independently of the\nagent\u2019s preferences, and provide a principled way to restrict the\nrange of acceptable representations. The challenge for defenders\nof this type of response is to specify what these additional facts\nare.\n\n\nI now turn to consider three influential representation\ntheorems. These representation theorems differ from each other in\nthree of philosophically significant ways. \n\n\nFirst, different representation theorems disagree about the objects\nof preference and utility.  Are they repeatable? Must they be wholly within the agent\u2019s control\n\n\nSecond, representation theorems differ in their treatment of\nprobability. They disagree about which entities have\nprobabilities, and about whether the same objects can have both\nprobabilities and utilities.\n\n\nThird, while every representation theorem proves that for a suitable\npreference ordering, there exist a probability and utility\nfunction representing the preference ordering, they differ how\nunique this probability and utility function are. In\nother words, they differ as to which transformations of the probability\nand utility functions are allowable.\n2.2.1 Ramsey\n\n\nThe idea of a representation theorem for expected utility dates back\nto Ramsey (1926).  (His sketch of a representation theorem is\nsubsequently filled in by Bradley (2004) and Elliott (2017).) Ramsey\nassumes that preferences are defined over a domain of gambles, which\nyield one prize on the condition that a proposition \\(P\\) is true, and\na different prize on the condition that \\(P\\) is false.  (Examples of\ngambles: you receive a onesie if you\u2019re having a baby and a bottle of\nscotch otherwise; you receive twenty dollars if Bojack wins the\nKentucky Derby and lose a dollar otherwise.) \n\n\nRamsey calls a proposition ethically neutral when \u201ctwo possible\nworlds differing only in regard to [its truth] are always of equal\nvalue\u201d.  For an ethically neutral proposition, probability 1/2\ncan be defined in terms of preference: such a proposition has\nprobability 1/2 just in case you are indifferent as to which side of\nit you bet on.  (So if Bojack wins the Kentucky Derby is an\nethically neutral proposition, it has probability 1/2 just in case you\nare indifferent between winning twenty dollars if it\u2019s true and losing\na dollar otherwise, and winning twenty dollars if it\u2019s false and\nlosing a dollar otherwise.) \n\n\nBy positing an ethically neutral proposition with probability 1/2,\ntogether with a rich space of prizes, Ramsey defines numerical\nutilities for prizes.  (The rough idea is that if you are indifferent\nbetween receiving a middling prize \\(m\\) for certain, and a gamble\nthat yields a better prize \\(b\\) if the ethically neutral proposition\nis true and a worse prize \\(w\\) if it is falls, then the utility of\n\\(m\\) is halfway between the utilities of \\(b\\) and \\(w\\).)  Using\nthese numerical utilities, he then exploits the definition of expected\nutility to define probabilities for all other propositions.\n\nThe rough idea is to exploit the richness of the space of prizes,\nwhich ensures that for any gamble \\(g\\) that yields better prize \\(b\\)\nif \\(E\\) is true and worse prize \\(w\\) if \\(E\\) is false, the agent is\nindifferent between \\(g\\) and some middling prize \\(m\\).  This means\nthat \\(EU(g) = EU(m)\\).  Using some algebra, plus the fact that\n\\(EU(g) = P(E)U(b) + (1-P(E))U(w)\\), Ramsey shows that\n\n\\[\nP(E) = \\frac{(1 - U(m)}{(U(b) - U(w))}\n\\]\n\n2.2.2 Von Neumann and Morgenstern\n\n\nVon Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) claim that preferences are defined\nover a domain of lotteries. Some of these lotteries are\nconstant, and yield a single prize with certainty. (Prizes\nmight include a banana, a million dollars, a million dollars\u2019 worth of\ndebt, death, or a new car.)  Lotteries can also have other lotteries\nas prizes, so that one can have a lottery with a 40% chance of\nyielding a banana, and a 60% chance of yielding a 50-50 gamble between\na million dollars and death.) The domain of lotteries is closed under\na mixing operation, so that if \\(L\\) and \\(L'\\) are lotteries and \\(x\\) is a\nreal number in the \\([0, 1]\\) interval, then there is a lottery \\(x L +\n(1-x) L'\\) that yields \\(L\\) with probability \\(x\\) and \\(L'\\) with\nprobability \\(1-x\\). They show that every preference relation obeying\ncertain axioms can be represented by the probabilities used to define\nthe lotteries, together with a utility function which is unique up to\npositive linear transformation.\n2.2.3 Savage\n\n\nInstead of taking probabilities for granted, as von Neumann and\nMorgenstern do, Savage (1972) defines them in terms of preferences\nover acts.  Savage posits three separate domains. Probability attaches\nto events, which we can think of as disjunctions of states,\nwhile utility and intrinsic preference attach to outcomes.\nExpected utility and non-intrinsic preference attach\nto acts. \n\n\nFor Savage, acts, states, and outcomes must satisfy certain\nconstraints.  Acts must be wholly under the agent\u2019s control (so\npublishing my paper in Mind is not an act, since it depends\npartly on the editor\u2019s decision, which I do not control). Outcomes\nmust have the same utility regardless of which state obtains (so \"I\nwin a fancy car\" is not an outcome, since the utility of the fancy car\nwill be greater in states where the person I most want to impress\nwishes I had a fancy car, and less in states where I lose my driver\u2019s\nlicense). No state can rule out the performance of any act, and an act\nand a state together must determine an outcome with certainty. For\neach outcome \\(o\\), there is a constant act which yields \\(o\\) in\nevery state. (Thus, if world peace is an outcome, there is an act that\nresults in world peace, no matter what the state of the world.)\nFinally, he assumes for any two acts \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and any event\n\\(E\\), there is a mixed act \\(A_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\) that yields the\nsame outcome as \\(A\\) if \\(E\\) is true, and the same outcome as \\(B\\)\notherwise. (Thus, if world peace and the end of the world are both\noutcomes, then there is a mixed act that results in world peace if a\ncertain coin lands heads, and the end of the world otherwise.)\n\n\nSavage postulates a preference relation over acts, and gives axioms\ngoverning that preference relation. He then defines subjective\nprobabilities, or degrees of belief, in terms of preferences. The key\nmove is to define an \u201cat least as likely as\u201d relation\nbetween events; I paraphrase here. \n\n\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constant acts such that \\(A\\) is preferred\nto \\(B\\). Then \\(E\\) is at least as likely as \\(F\\) just in case the\nagent either prefers \\(A_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\) (the act that yields\n\\(A\\) if \\(E\\) obtains, and \\(B\\) otherwise) to \\(A_F \\amp B_{\\sim\nF}\\) (the act that yields \\(A\\) if \\(F\\) obtains, and \\(B\\)\notherwise), or else is indifferent between \\(A_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\) and\n\\(A_F \\amp B_{\\sim F}\\).\n\n\n\nThe thought behind the definition is that the agent considers \\(E\\) at\nleast as likely as \\(F\\) just in case she would not rather\nbet on \\(F\\) than on \\(E\\)).\n\n\nSavage then gives axioms constraining rational preference, and shows\nthat any set of preferences satisfying those axioms yields an\n\u201cat least as likely\u201d relation that can be uniquely\nrepresented by a probability function. In other words, there is one\nand only one probability function \\(P\\) such that for all \\(E\\) and \\(F\\),\n\\(P(E) \\ge P(F)\\) if and only if \\(E\\) is at least as likely as \\(F\\). Every\npreference relation obeying Savage\u2019s axioms is represented by this\nprobability function \\(P\\), together with a utility function which is\nunique up to positive linear transformation.\n\n\nSavage\u2019s representation theorem gives strong results: starting\nwith a preference ordering alone, we can find a single probability\nfunction, and a narrow class of utility functions, which represent that\npreference ordering. The downside, however, is that Savage has to\nbuild implausibly strong assumptions about the domain of acts.\n\n\nLuce and Suppes (1965) point out that Savage\u2019s constant acts\nare implausible. (Recall that constant acts yield the same\noutcome and the same amount of value in every state.) Take some\nvery good outcome\u2014total bliss for everyone. Is there really\na constant act that has this outcome in every possible state, including\nstates where the human race is wiped out by a meteor? \nSavage\u2019s reliance on a rich space of mixed acts is also\nproblematic. Savage has had to assume that any two outcomes and\nany event, there is a mixed act that yields the first outcome if the\nevent occurs, and the second outcome otherwise? Is there really an act\nthat yields total bliss if everyone is killed by an\nantibiotic-resistant plague, and total misery otherwise? Luce and\nKrantz (1971) suggest ways of reformulating Savage\u2019s\nrepresentation theorem that weaken these assumptions, but Joyce (1999)\nargues that even on the weakened assumptions, the domain of acts\nremains implausibly rich.\n2.2.4 Bolker and Jeffrey\n\n\nBolker (1966) proves a general representation theorem about\nmathematical expectations, which Jeffrey (1983) uses as the basis for a\nphilosophical account of expected utility theory. Bolker\u2019s\ntheorem assumes a single domain of propositions, which are objects of\npreference, utility, and probability alike. Thus, the proposition that\nit will rain today has a utility, as well as a probability. \nJeffrey interprets this utility as the proposition\u2019s news\nvalue\u2014a measure of how happy or disappointed I would be to\nlearn that the proposition was true. By convention, he sets the\nvalue of the necessary proposition at 0\u2014the necessary proposition\nis no news at all! Likewise, the proposition that I take my\numbrella to work, which is an act, has a probability as well as a\nutility. Jeffrey interprets this to mean that I have degrees of\nbelief about what I will do.\n\n\nBolker gives axioms constraining preference, and shows that any\npreferences satisfying his axioms can be represented by a probability\nmeasure \\(P\\) and a utility measure \\(U\\). However,\nBolker\u2019s axioms do not ensure that \\(P\\) is unique, or that\n\\(U\\) is unique up to positive linear transformation. Nor do\nthey allow us to define comparative probability in terms of\npreference. Instead, where \\(P\\) and \\(U\\) jointly\nrepresent a preference ordering, Bolker shows that the pair\n\\(\\langle P, U \\rangle\\) is unique up to a fractional linear\ntransformation. \n\n\nIn technical terms, where \\(U\\) is a utility function\nnormalized so that \\(U(\\Omega) = 0\\), \\(inf\\) is the\ngreatest lower bound of the values assigned by \\(U\\), \\(sup\\)\nis the least upper bound of the values assigned by by \\(U\\), and\n\\(\\lambda\\) is a parameter falling between \\(-1/inf\\) and\n\\(-1/sup\\), the fractional linear transformation\n\\(\\langle P_{\\lambda}, U_{\\lambda} \\rangle\\) of\n\\(\\langle P, U \\rangle\\) corresponding to \\(\\lambda\\) is given\nby:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n P_{\\lambda} &= P(x)(1 + \\lambda U(x)) \\\\\n U_{\\lambda} &= U(x)((1+\\lambda)/(1 + \\lambda U(x))\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNotice that fractional linear transformations of a\nprobability-utility pair can disagree with the original pair about\nwhich propositions are likelier than which others.\n\n\nJoyce (1999) shows that with additional resources, Bolker\u2019s\ntheorem can be modified to pin down a unique \\(P\\), and a\n\\(U\\) that is unique up to positive linear transformation. \nWe need only supplement the preference ordering with a primitive\n\u201cmore likely than\u201d relation, governed by its own set of\naxioms, and linked to belief by several additional axioms. Joyce\nmodifies Bolker\u2019s result to show that given these additional\naxioms, the \u201cmore likely than\u201d relation is represented by a\nunique \\(P\\), and the preference ordering is represented by\n\\(P\\) together with a utility function that is unique up to\npositive linear transformation.\n2.2.5 Summary\n\n\nTogether, these four representation theorems above can be summed up\nin the following table.\n\n\nTheorem\nObjects ofpreference\nOrder ofconstruction\nAllowabletransformations:probability\nAllowabletransformations: utility\n\n\nRamsey\ngambles\npreference \u2192 utility \u2192 probability\nidentity\npositive linear\n\n\nvon\u00a0Neumann/Morgenstern\nlotteries\n(preference & probability) \u2192 utility\nN/A\npositive linear\n\n\nSavage\nacts\npreference \u2192 probability \u2192 utility\nidentity\npositive linear\n\n\nJeffrey/Bolker\npropositions\npreference \u2192 (probability & utility)\n\u2014\u00a0fractional\u00a0linear\u00a0\u2014\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the order of construction differs between theorems: Ramsey\nconstructs a representation of probability using utility, while von\nNeumann and Morgenstern begin with probabilities and construct a\nrepresentation of utility. Thus, although the arrows represent a\nmathematical relationship of representation, they cannot represent a\nmetaphysical relationship of grounding. The Reality Condition needs to\nbe justified independently of any representation theorem.\n\n\nSuitably structured ordinal probabilities (the relations picked out\nby \u201cat least as likely as\u201d, \u201cmore likely than\u201d,\nand \u201cequally likely\u201d) stand in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the cardinal probability functions. Finally, the grey line\nfrom preferences to ordinal probabilities indicates that every\nprobability function satisfying Savage\u2019s axioms is represented by\na unique cardinal probability\u2014but this result does not hold for\nJeffrey\u2019s axioms.\n\n\nNotice that it is often possible to follow the arrows in\ncircles\u2014from preference to ordinal probability, from ordinal\nprobability to cardinal probability, from cardinal probability and\npreference to expected utility, and from expected utility back to\npreference. Thus, although the arrows represent a mathematical\nrelationship of representation, they do not represent a metaphysical\nrelationship of grounding. This fact drives home the importance\n\nof independently justifying the Reality Condition\u2014representation\ntheorems cannot justify expected utility theory without additional\nassumptions.\n",
