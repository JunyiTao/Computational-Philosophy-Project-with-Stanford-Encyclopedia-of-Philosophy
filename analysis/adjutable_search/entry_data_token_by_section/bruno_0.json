    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nFilippo Bruno was born in January or February 1548, son of Giovanni\nBruno, a soldier of modest circumstances, and Fraulissa Savolina, at\nNola, about 17 miles north east of Naples. At the unusually late age\nof seventeen, beguiled perhaps by the prospect of a life dedicated to\nlearning, he entered the Dominican convent of San Domenico Maggiore in\nNaples, assuming the name Giordano. In 1572 he became a priest and\nlater that year began to study theology formally, obtaining his\ndoctorate in July 1575. That year he was investigated by his\nProvincial for his views on the Trinity, a delicate topic in\nReformation Europe. This was not the first occasion on which he had\nscandalized his fellow friars and, exasperated with the constraints of\nthe religious life, he fled the convent in early 1576. He went first\nto Rome and then, taking off his habit, proceeded to northern Italy.\nHe was now a fugitive from his order and excommunicate. Over the next\nfourteen or so years he moved from one town or city to another, first\nin Italy and then in France, Switzerland, England, Germany and\nBohemia. In 1591 he returned, fatefully, to Venice. It was during\nthese unsettled years that Bruno composed those Italian and Latin\nworks of his that survive today.\n\nWithout family, connections or means of his own, Bruno relied on his\nwits. For example, at Noli, between Nice and Genoa, he taught Latin to\nschoolboys and elementary astronomy to \u201ccertain gentlemen\u201d\n(Firpo 2000: 45). In Geneva, he worked in a printer\u2019s shop,\ncorrecting proofs. He aspired to greater things. His goal was to teach\nphilosophy without the trammels of revealed truths, preferably at a\nuniversity. On several occasions, a position of this kind seemed\nwithin his grasp. Two factors, however, conspired to thwart his\nambitions. The first was the unsettled circumstances of Reformation\nEurope. At Toulouse, for example, he taught philosophy at the\nuniversity for nearly two years (1579\u201381), but renewed conflict\nbetween Catholics and Huguenots in the summer of 1581 forced him to\nleave the city. His notoriety further complicated matters. In a\ndispatch dated 28 March 1583, the English ambassador in Paris, Henry\nCobham, alerted Queen Elizabeth\u2019s principal secretary, Francis\nWalsingham, to Bruno\u2019s impending arrival: \u201cIl Sr Doctor\nJordano Bruno Nolano, a professor in philosophy, intendeth to pass\ninto England; whose religion I cannot commend\u201d (Aquilecchia\n1995: 22, 24). Not by chance does Bruno have the distinction of being the\nonly known sixteenth-century philosopher to have been excommunicated\nfrom all three major confessions: Roman Catholic (Naples, 1576),\nCalvinist (Geneva, 1579) and Lutheran (Helmstedt, 1589). The second\nfactor was his temperament. Intolerant of those whom he deemed fools,\nBruno repeatedly caused offence. In The Ash Wednesday Supper,\nthe first and best known of the six philosophical dialogues in Italian\nthat he published while living in London, he decried the ignorance and\npomposity of English men of learning and cast aspersions on the London\ncommoner. He compared himself, \u201ca Neapolitan born and bred under\na more benign sky\u201d, with a hapless antagonist at Oxford\nUniversity, whom he described as a discourteous \u201cpig\u201d (BOI\nI, 535). Such was the offence that the work caused that he began his\nnext dialogue, On the Cause, the Principle and the One with\nan elaborate apology in which he retracted his comments while\nsimultaneously justifying them. It was a ploy that he would use again,\nill-advisedly, during his trial.\n\n\nBruno\u2019s wanderings came to an abrupt end shortly after he\nreturned to Italy in late August 1591. After a brief stay in Venice,\nhe moved to Padua for three months or so and then returned to Venice\nto take up lodgings with the Venetian patrician Giovanni Mocenigo, to\nwhom he divulged the \u201csecrets\u201d of his mnemotechnics and\nphilosophy. Alarmed at some of Bruno\u2019s views, Mocenigo denounced\nhim to the Venetian Inquisition on 22 May 1592. Events took a decided\nturn for the worse when, on 12 September 1592, the Papal Nuncio in\nVenice, on behalf of the Holy Office in Rome, requested Bruno\u2019s\nextradition. The Venetian authorities dilly-dallied, before eventually\nacceding to the request in January 1593. At Rome, the trial proceeded\nslowly. Eventually, on 14 January 1599, the Congregation of the Holy\nOffice approved a list (now lost) of eight heretical propositions\nassembled by Robert Bellarmine, S.J., and Alberto Tragagliolo, O.P.,\nfrom the trial records and copies of Bruno\u2019s works. Bruno was\ninvited to consider \u201cwhether he wished to abjure the\npropositions as heretical\u201d (Firpo 2000: 411, 413, doc. 55). Four\ndays later, he was brought before the Congregation and ordered to\nabjure the propositions within six days. Bruno conceded, with\nqualifications, and then submitted a written defence of his views.\n\nThe trial proceeded, with Bruno abjuring the heresies of which he was\naccused, while at the same time taking issue, in written depositions,\nwith aspects of the accusations. It was not, as mentioned above, the\nfirst time that Bruno had used this ploy, turning concession into a\nspringboard for reasserting his position. On this occasion, however,\nthe stakes were higher, as he surely knew. On 21 December 1599, the\ndie was cast when he retorted to the Inquisitors that\n\n\nhe neither needed nor wished to recant, that he had nothing to recant,\nthat he did not have views to recant, and did not know about what he should\nrecant. (Firpo 2000: clxxvi, 463, doc. 65)\n\n\nThe Congregation made a final attempt the same day, sending the\nDominican General and the Procurator, two of the most distinguished\nmembers of the order that he had deserted almost twenty four years\npreviously, to plead with him, in vain. On 20 January 1600, the\nCongregation, with Pope Clement VIII presiding, ordered that all of\nBruno\u2019s works be placed on the Index of Prohibited Books and\nthat he should be consigned to the secular authorities of Rome for\npunishment as an impenitent, pertinacious and obstinate heretic.\nBruno\u2019s final written deposition, addressed to the pope,\n\u201cwas opened but not read\u201d (Firpo 2000: 471, 475, doc. 65a-b). At dawn\non 17 February 1600, he was led out onto the Campo de\u2019 Fiori.\nWith a metal plate clamped over his tongue, Bruno was stripped, tied to a\nstake and, accompanied by the chants of the Confraternity of the\nBeheading of St John, burned alive.\n",
