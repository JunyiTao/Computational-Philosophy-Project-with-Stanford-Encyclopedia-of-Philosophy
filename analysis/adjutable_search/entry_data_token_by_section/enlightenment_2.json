    "main_text": "The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment || Empiricism and the Enlightenment\n1.2 Empiricism and the Enlightenment\n\nDespite the confidence in and enthusiasm for human reason in the\nEnlightenment \u2013 it is sometimes called \u201cthe Age of\nReason\u201d \u2013 the rise of empiricism, both in the practice of\nscience and in the theory of knowledge, is characteristic of the\nperiod. The enthusiasm for reason in the Enlightenment is primarily\nnot for the faculty of reason as an independent source of knowledge,\nwhich is embattled in the period, but rather for the human cognitive\nfaculties generally; the Age of Reason contrasts with an age of\nreligious faith, not with an age of sense experience. Though the great\nseventeenth century rationalist metaphysical systems of Descartes,\nSpinoza and Leibniz exert tremendous influence on philosophy in the\nEnlightenment; moreover, and though the eighteenth-century\nEnlightenment has a rationalist strain (perhaps best exemplified by\nthe system of Christian Wolff), nevertheless, that the\nEncyclopedia of Diderot and D\u2019Alembert is dedicated to\nthree empiricists (Francis Bacon, John Locke and Isaac Newton),\nsignals the ascendency of empiricism in the period.\n\nIf the founder of the rationalist strain of the Enlightenment is\nDescartes, then the founder of the empiricist strain is Francis Bacon\n(1561\u20131626). Though Bacon\u2019s work belongs to the\nRenaissance, the revolution he undertook to effect in the sciences\ninspires and influences Enlightenment thinkers. The Enlightenment, as\nthe age in which experimental natural science matures and comes into\nits own, admires Bacon as \u201cthe father of experimental\nphilosophy.\u201d Bacon\u2019s revolution (enacted in, among other\nworks, The New Organon, 1620) involves conceiving the new\nscience as (1) founded on empirical observation and experimentation;\n(2) arrived at through the method of induction; and (3) as ultimately\naiming at, and as confirmed by, enhanced practical capacities (hence\nthe Baconian motto, \u201cknowledge is power\u201d).\n\nOf these elements of Bacon\u2019s revolution, the point about method\ndeserves special emphasis. Isaac Newton\u2019s work, which stands as\nthe great exemplar of the accomplishments of natural science for the\neighteenth century, is, like Bacon\u2019s, based on the inductive\nmethod. Whereas rationalist of the seventeenth century tend to\nconceive of scientific knowledge of nature as consisting in a system\nin which statements expressing the observable phenomena of nature are\ndeduced from first principles, known a priori, Newton\u2019s\nmethod begins with the observed phenomena of nature and reduces its\nmultiplicity to unity by induction, that is, by finding mathematical\nlaws or principles from which the observed phenomena can be derived or\nexplained. The evident success of Newton\u2019s\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d procedure contrasts sharply with the seemingly\nendless and fruitless conflicts among philosophers regarding the\nmeaning and validity of first principles of reason, and this contrast\nnaturally favors the rise of the Newtonian (or Baconian) method of\nacquiring knowledge of nature in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe tendency of natural science toward progressive independence from\nmetaphysics in the eighteenth century is correlated with this point\nabout method. The rise of modern science in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries proceeds through its separation from the\npresuppositions, doctrines and methodology of theology; natural\nscience in the eighteenth century proceeds to separate itself from\nmetaphysics as well. Newton proves the capacity of natural science to\nsucceed independently of a priori, clear and certain first principles.\nThe characteristic Enlightenment suspicion of all allegedly\nauthoritative claims the validity of which is obscure, which is\ndirected first of all against religious dogmas, extends to the claims\nof metaphysics as well. While there are significant Enlightenment\nthinkers who are metaphysicians \u2013 again, one thinks of Christian\nWolff \u2013 the general thrust of Enlightenment thought is\nanti-metaphysical.\n\nJohn Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n(1690) is another foundational text of the Enlightenment. A main\nsource of its influence is the epistemological rigor that it displays,\nwhich is at least implicitly anti-metaphysical. Locke undertakes in\nthis work to examine the human understanding in order to determine the\nlimits of human knowledge; he thereby institutes a prominent pattern\nof Enlightenment epistemology. Locke finds the source of all our\nideas, the ideas out of which human knowledge is constructed, in the\nsenses and argues influentially against the rationalists\u2019\ndoctrine of innate ideas. Locke\u2019s sensationalism exerts great\ninfluence in the French Enlightenment, primarily through being taken\nup and radicalized by the philosophe, Abb\u00e9 de\nCondillac. In the Treatise on Sensations (1754), Condillac\nattempts to explain how all human knowledge arises out of sense\nexperience. Locke\u2019s epistemology, as developed by Condillac and\nothers, contributes greatly to the emerging science of psychology in\nthe period.\n\nLocke and Descartes both pursue a method in epistemology that brings\nwith it the epistemological problem of objectivity. Both examine our\nknowledge by way of examining the ideas we encounter directly in our\nconsciousness. This method comes to be called \u201cthe way of\nideas\u201d. Though neither for Locke nor for Descartes do\nall of our ideas represent their objects by way of\nresembling them (e.g., our idea of God does not represent God\nby virtue of resembling God), our alleged knowledge of our environment\nthrough the senses does depend largely on ideas that allegedly\nresemble external material objects. The way of ideas implies the\nepistemological problem of how we can know that these ideas do in fact\nresemble their objects. How can we be sure that these objects do not\nappear one way before the mind and exist in another way (or not at\nall) in reality outside the mind? George Berkeley, an empiricist\nphilosopher influenced by John Locke, avoids the problem by asserting\nthe metaphysics of idealism: the (apparently material) objects of\nperception are nothing but ideas before the mind. However,\nBerkeley\u2019s idealism is less influential in, and characteristic\nof, the Enlightenment, than the opposing positions of materialism and\nCartesian dualism. Thomas Reid, a prominent member of the Scottish\nEnlightenment, attacks the way of ideas and argues that the immediate\nobjects of our (sense) perception are the common (material) objects in\nour environment, not ideas in our mind. Reid mounts his defense of\nna\u00efve realism as a defense of common sense over against the\ndoctrines of the philosophers. The defense of common sense, and the\nrelated idea that the results of philosophy ought to be of use to\ncommon people, are characteristic ideas of the Enlightenment,\nparticularly pronounced in the Scottish Enlightenment.\n",
