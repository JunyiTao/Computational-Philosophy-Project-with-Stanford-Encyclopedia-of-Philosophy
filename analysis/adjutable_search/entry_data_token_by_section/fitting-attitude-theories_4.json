    "main_text": "Clarifying FA Theories: Some Choice Points || Buck Passing\n1.5 Buck Passing\n\nSome suggest that FA theories date as far back as Kant (1785 [1996])\n(see, e.g., Suikkanen 2009). More commonly, the progenitors of FA\ntheory are taken to be Sidgwick (1874) and Brentano (1889/2009).\nAlthough many have discussed and defended FA theories in the meantime\n(for a nice potted history, see Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004) it\u2019s relatively\nuncontroversial that T.M. Scanlon (1998) is largely responsible for\nthe contemporary revival of interest in FA theory (Jacobson 2011).\nAccording to Scanlon\u2019s \u201cbuck-passing\u201d account of\nvalue, \u201cto call something valuable is to say that it has other\nproperties that provide reasons for behaving in certain ways with\nregard to it\u201d (96). There are several things to note about\nScanlon\u2019s account. First, it purports to provide a theory\nspecifically of being valuable simpliciter. Scanlon\ndoesn\u2019t comment on whether he takes the form of his account to\ngeneralize to apply to more specific evaluative properties such as\nbeing lovable or delightful, though it\u2019s easy to see how it\nmight. For example, we might claim that to call something delightful\nis to say that it has other properties that provide reasons for being\ndelighted by it. Second, Scanlon isn\u2019t very specific about\nhow we have reason to behave with regard to valuable things,\ni.e., about the specific human responses in terms of which he aims to\nexplain facts about value simpliciter. This seems\nintentional. Scanlon suggests that \u201cto claim that something is\nvaluable (or that it is \u2018of value\u2019) is to claim that\nothers also have reason to value it, as you do\u201d (95), but holds\nthat \u201cvaluing\u201d might consist variously in a range of\npro-responses, where the particular kind of pro-response to a valuable\nthing that we have reasons to have depends on, and so varies according\nto, the kind of valuable thing at issue. For example, on\nScanlon\u2019s view, the pro-response(s) that we have reasons to have\ntoward a valuable piece of music can differ from the pro-response that\nwe have reasons to have toward a valuable friendship. And it can be\nmatter of substantive normative dispute, he suggests, which\npro-response we have reasons to have toward each. Thus, Scanlon\nwrites: \u201cunderstanding the value of something often involves not\nmerely knowing that it is valuable or how valuable it is, but also how\nit is to be valued\u201d (100). (For a possible difficulty with this\npart of Scanlon\u2019s view, see section 3.4.)\n\nThe final thing to note about Scanlon\u2019s account is its\ncommitment to the claim that the property of being valuable\ndoesn\u2019t itself provide a reason to value the things that have\nit. Rather, Scanlon claims, being valuable is the \u201cpurely\nformal, higher-order\u201d property of having other properties that\nprovide reasons for a pro-response. This is the feature of\nScanlon\u2019s view that makes it a \u201cbuck-passing\u201d\naccount: the account passes the normative buck from the property of\nbeing valuable to lower-order properties of a thing that provide\nreasons to respond to it favorably, where these lower-order properties\ncorrespond to the value-making features of the valuable thing in\nquestion. This feature of Scanlon\u2019s account has been called its\n\u201cnegative thesis\u201d (Schroeder 2009). This is in contrast to\nits \u201cpositive thesis\u201d: that whenever something is\nvaluable, that\u2019s fully\u00a0because there are reasons to have a\npro-response to it. The positive thesis is what makes Scanlon\u2019s\ntheory an FA theory: it claims that certain evaluative\nfacts\u2014facts about value simpliciter\u2014are always\ngrounded in normative facts about certain human responses, viz., facts\nto the effect that the relevant responses are favored by reasons. As\nseveral authors have pointed out, however, Scanlon\u2019s negative\nthesis isn\u2019t entailed by the positive one and is otherwise\ninessential to FA theory (see esp. Schroeder 2009). The costs and\nbenefits of the negative thesis are still being debated today (for\nsome advantages, see Suikkanen 2009; for some costs, see Schroeder\n2009 and Johnson King 2019). Perhaps the most promising, conciliatory\napproach is to claim that the property of being valuable does provide\na reason to value the things that have it, but only a\nderivative reason which doesn\u2019t contribute any weight\nto the case for valuing the thing in question over and above that\ncontributed by the non-derivative reasons provided by certain of the\nthing\u2019s lower-order properties (Schroeder 2009; McHugh and Way\n2016; Rowland 2019). Regardless, since the negative thesis isn\u2019t\nplausibly essential to FA theory, whether to accept this or some other\nversion of it is a further choice point for FA theorists.\n\nTo summarize, FA theorists face a number of choices in formulating\ntheir theories: are their theories metaphysical accounts of evaluative\nfacts and properties, analyses of evaluative concepts, or semantic\naccounts of evaluative terms? Which evaluative items, in particular,\nwill they aim to explain? Which normative property of responses will\ntheir theories appeal to: fittingness, reasons, or some alternative?\nWho are the subjects of the relevant responses? And do their accounts\n\u201cpass the buck\u201d? We can characterize FA theories, defining\ntheir nature and scope, according to our answers to these\nquestions.\n",
