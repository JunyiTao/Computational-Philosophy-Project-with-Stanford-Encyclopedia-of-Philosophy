    "main_text": "Testing and Standards of Evidence || Testing adaptive hypotheses\n3.2 Testing adaptive hypotheses\n\n\n The debate over\nadaptationism contains claims and counterclaims about what hypotheses\nshould be included in an analysis of the adaptiveness of a trait.\nThis is crucial because assessments of evidentiary support depend on\nwhat hypotheses we consider (see Sober 1990, Earman 1992). We\nmust consider all the relevant hypotheses in order to provide good\nevidence for a hypothesis (Stanford 2006, Forber 2010). One\ncommon pluralist complaint is that adaptationists neglect this standard\nof evidence. Such an inclusive standard is essential because many\ndifferent evolutionary trajectories can lead to the same outcome.\nAs Gould and Lewontin (1979) wrote, \u201cOne must not confuse the\nfact that a structure is used in some way\u2026with the primary\nevolutionary reason for its existence and conformation\u201d. In\naddition, subtle differences in evolutionary history may lead to\ndifferent evolutionary outcomes (Beatty and Desjardins 2009). Thus, we\ncannot conclude that natural selection played an important role in the\nevolution of some trait just because we have a plausible adaptive\nhypothesis in mind. Indeed, finding suitable evidence for an\nadaptive (or non-adaptive) hypothesis is difficult because we lack good\nepistemic access to evolutionary history. This lack of access is\na premise of Gould and Lewontin's critique, and it motivates\ntheir call to evaluate testing methods in evolutionary biology,\nespecially those methods that consider only adaptive hypotheses with no\nregard for non-adaptive rivals. Biologists have continued to develop\nnew testing methods that do this (see, e.g., Rose and Lauder 1996,\nHansen et al. 2008).\n\n\n This aspect of the adaptationism debate is\nconnected with a general epistemological issue in philosophy of\nscience: underdetermination of theory by evidence. Evolutionary\nhypotheses are typically underdetermined by available evidence.\nIn principle, rival hypotheses make different commitments about the\nnature of evolutionary history, but in practice these hypotheses are\nempirically indistinguishable given the available evidence.\nPhilosophers argue about the consequences of this underdetermination\nfor our understanding of biological science (Turner 2005, Stanford\n2006). Yet, there is agreement that the problem of underdetermination\nshould be addressed by developing and using tests that discriminate\nbetween rival hypotheses.\n\n\n Evidentiary relations depend on what\nhypotheses we compare, and so good testing methods should include all\nrival hypotheses. If we fail to include a relevant rival, say,\none that emphasizes developmental constraint, then we may not have\nfound sufficient evidence for the adaptive hypothesis. Failing to\ncontrast adaptive and non-adaptive explanations weakens any\nadaptationist analysis (Forber 2009).\n\n\n Evolutionary hypotheses make a\nvariety of commitments about development, ecology, genetics, and\nhistory. As a result, an adaptive hypothesis makes contact with\nevolutionary history only in conjunction with a number of auxiliary\nhypotheses. The most convincing case for an adaptive hypothesis will\ninclude a variety of evidence, especially independent data that confirm\nthe different facets of an evolutionary hypothesis (Lloyd 1988).\nSober's (2008) analysis of a testing protocol for evolutionary\nhypotheses makes clear the role of auxiliary hypotheses and assesses\nthe evidentiary import of different observed outcomes. He provides an\nanalysis of whether and how fit between an optimality model and the\nobserved population mean favors natural selection over genetic\ndrift.\n",
