    "main_text": "William Ockham and Mental Language\n5. John Buridan and Vague Concepts\n\nOckham and John Buridan\u2019s accounts of thought are on the one\nhand very similar, but on the other hand there are fundamental\ndifferences between them. This is particularly true about their view\nof mental representation. A case in point is their views of singular\nthought. They both start out from the same idea, that is, that\nthinking something singular is having a singular concept in mind, but\nthey disagree fundamentally on what a singular concept looks like and,\nforemost, on how it manages to latch onto the world. On Ockham\u2019s\naccount a concept is singular because its cause is proper, as he calls\nit, and proper causes are necessarily tied to one object. But on\nBuridan\u2019s account, a singular concept is singular because of its\nsemantic complexity (see Klima 2001: xxxviii\u2013xlii and 2009:\n40\u201356). It has a descriptive content that enables it to narrow\ndown its signification. However, Buridan retains Ockham\u2019s view for\nsome terms (for the significance of this difference from Ockham, see\nKlima 2009: 69\u201389).\n\nBuridan thinks that we always in the first instance cognize or\nconceive of something as singular. There are, however, two kinds of\nsingular concepts, namely, vague and determinate singular concepts.\nThere are also two ways a singular concept or mental term can be\nacquired. The vague terms are acquired through perception and involves\na direct acquaintance with the perceived object. Buridan describes how\nwe see something approaching from a distance and cognize it as\n\u2018this thing\u2019, then as \u2018this body\u2019, then as\n\u2018this animal\u2019, then as \u2018this donkey\u2019, and\nfinally as \u2018Brunellus.\u2019 (For more on this and its\nsignificance see Normore 2007, Black 2011, Lagerlund 2006, and\nLagerlund 2014.) These demonstratives describe circumstances in which\nwe cognize something singularly, and they come together under a\ndescription of a singular thing, which we impose on it ourselves or\nhave learned the name of, in this case, \u2018Brunellus.\u2019 The\nvague singular term is a name for a circumstance in which we cognize a\nnon-determinate singular thing as something, for example, an\nindividual thing, body, donkey, etc. There is, however, another way a\nsingular can be formed and that is by imposing or associating it with\na name of some descriptions or properties that we never have had a\ncorresponding vague singular cognition of, since we have no actual\nacquaintance with the thing through sense perception. These are\nsingular terms like \u2018Socrates\u2019 or \u2018Plato.\u2019\nThey have never directly existed before our senses and intellect. We\nonly know them through descriptions. Buridan explains the difference\nin Summulae de Dialectica 8.2.1 (Buridan SD, 633): \n\nAnother reason is that things cannot be cognized as singular unless\nthey are cognized as something in the prospect of the cognizer.\nTherefore, if I did not perceive Socrates, you cannot tell me what I\nshould understand by \u2018Socrates,\u2019 except by using common\nterms, the aggregate of which can just as well apply to something else\nas to Socrates. So, should another thing be created similar to\nSocrates in all of its external features [circumstantiis], this\n[aggregate] would no longer be the definition of\n\u2018Socrates\u2019, for it would not be proper to it, nor\nconvertible with it.\n\n\nAs explained above, only terms that derive from actual sense\ncognitions (what he here calls cognition in \u2018the prospect\u2019) are\nproperly singular. They have an element that fixes them to the thing\ncognized.\n\nHe seems to think that all proper singular terms are collections of\ndescriptions of a thing under a name. This goes for singulars that I\nam acquainted with as well as singulars I have no sense acquaintance\nwith. Assume that I have the concept \u2018Brunellus\u2019 in my\nmental language, which I have formed through vague singulars, that is,\nthrough circumstances in which I have perceived him as this or that.\nThese vague singulars express the demonstrative aspect of my\nexperience of Brunellus. They come together under the singular term\n\u2018Brunellus\u2019 with all the things I \u2018know\u2019 about\nhim. I have no such demonstrative element in my singular terms of\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 and \u2018Plato,\u2019 since they have never\nand cannot exist in a direct sense cognition. In that respect, there\nis nothing part of such singular terms that discriminate them from\nother term than the sum of descriptions I have sorted under these\nterms. They will, to use Saul Kripke\u2019s terminology, never\nrigidly pick out what they signify. \u2018Brunellus\u2019 on the\nother hand will, because of the demonstrative element derived from my\nactual interactions with him. (For a slightly different take on this preserving the rigid designation of terms like 'Socrates' or 'Plato' see Klima 2009, Chapter 4, Section 4.2.)\n\nBuridan is defending an internalist semantics for singular terms. It\nis not internalist because of the two different kinds of singular\nterms or that they both are collections of descriptions and\ncircumstances in which we have interacted with something, but instead\nbecause the imposition of these terms describes a process that is\ncompletely internal to the agent. It is up to us to sort names with\ndescriptions and circumstances and, hence, impose certain names on\nthese descriptions and circumstances. Give this, two speakers of the\nsame language could have the same name for an individual and even be\nusing it for the same individual despite the fact that the names they\nuse have different content or meaning because they have different\ndescriptions in mind during the conversation. Meaning is, hence, in\nthe head for Buridan. A position quite different from Ockham (for more\non this see Panaccio 2017 and Lagerlund 2024).\n",
