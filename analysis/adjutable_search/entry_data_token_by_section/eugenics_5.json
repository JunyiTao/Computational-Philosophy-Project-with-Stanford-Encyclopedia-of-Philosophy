Indeed, the past use of eugenic policies provides\ngood reasons for these worries.\n\n\nThe use of reprogenetic technologies to select or\nedit embryos can contribute to social injustices in various ways. For\ninstance, given the significant costs of these technologies, its use is\nlikely to increase inequalities between people who have the finances to\nafford them, and those who do not. The wealthy already have advantages;\nif we allow them to select or edit their offspring for improvements\n \u2013 so that they are smarter, faster, stronger, with less need to\nsleep, etc. \u2013 those children will be ever more competitive, and\nliable to increase the divide between rich and poor. (Lee Silver\nexplores this dystopian possibility with the GenRich and the Naturals\nin his Remaking Eden, 1997, though he still supports the use\nof these technologies.)\n\n\nProponents of liberal eugenics have offer several\nresponses to this concern. Some contend that these technologies will\neventually become widely available and thus, that the critics\u2019\nworries are overstated. For example, Green (2007) notes that all\ninnovations have a period of diffusion, during which early adopters pay\nhigher prices and take some risks for the potential of leading the way\nforward, and then, if the technology is successful, prices drop and the\nwider public gains access through the market. Similarly, Buchanan\n(2011) compares genetic intervention to literacy, numeracy, and\nagriculture, and argues that these innovations too were only available\nto a few at the start, but then became broadly accessible.\n\n\nFor others this problem would be avoided by\nensuring that the technologies are available to everyone, at least for\ntraits that offer significant advantages (Buchanan 2011). Traits that\nonly offer positional advantages \u2013 being taller than, perhaps\nfaster than \u2013 would then be self-defeating (Buchanan et al. 2000)\nif available to all, and the allure might fade. Other\ntraits \u2013 perhaps enhanced concentration, memory, or\nimmunity \u2013 might be advantageous regardless of how many people have\nthem. Providing funding to improve accessibility would then be\nnecessary in order to ensure fairness.\n\n\nOf course, whether these responses assuage\nconcerns about increasing inequality depends on their feasibility. We\nhave at least some reasons not to be very hopeful in such regard. \nAfter all, technologies such as IVF have been around for several\ndecades, and though more people now have access to them, they are far\nfrom being cheap technologies, accessible to everyone who wishes to use\nthem. Also, given the many serious problems our society faces,\nprioritizing access to these technologies rather than using resources\nfor something else that would be more cost-effective would require\njustification.\n\n\nAnother way in which the use of reprogenetic\ntechnologies to select or edit embryos can contribute to social\ninjustices is related not to access but to the kinds of values that are\nlikely to guide parental choices. Critics highlight the troubling\naggregate effect of individual choices, particularly when they are\noften ill-informed or relatively biased (de Melo Martin 2004; Goering\n2000). They call attention to the deeply entrenched social injustices\nthat pervade many societies, and that would typically inform individual\nfree choices. Tremain (2006) discusses this effect in relation to\ndisability. Russell (2010) argues that taking race to be a morally\nneutral feature (as Harris does) is only a \u201cveiled attempt\u201d\nto distinguish contemporary from historical eugenics practices. Perhaps\nrace should be morally neutral, but it is not commonly treated as such,\nand opening up \u201cchoice\u201d for people who harbor explicit or\nimplicit biases related to race allows for those biases to shape the\nnext generation. Oliver (2010) likewise highlights the trick of\nlabeling gender a morally neutral category in a world filled with\nsexism, and also rightly emphasizes the levels of surveillance and\ncontrol over women that are likely to follow the implementation of\nliberal eugenics. The unintended negative effects on pregnant women of\nincreased attention to prenatal testing and surveillance of pregnancy\ngenerally are explored in Katz Rothman (1986), Rapp (1999), and Kukla\n(2008), but tend to be ignored by liberal eugenics advocates (Oliver\n2010; de Melo-Martin 2017). (See also the entry on \n pregnancy, birth and medicine).\n\n\nLiberal eugenics proponents are generally\nsympathetic to these concerns \u2013indeed, some of them, have\nexplored directly issues related to collective action problems (Anomaly\n2020) \u2013 and have tried to respond to them. Some argue for constraints\non the types of traits that parents should be allowed to select or edit\n(Agar 2004; Green 2007). Some characteristics, e.g., homosexuality,\ndark skin, will only be harmful to the individual in a morally\ndefective social environment. What is needed in such a case, proponents\nargue, is to change attitudes and social practices instead of\npeople\u2019s genomes. For instance, Agar acknowledges that it would\nbe preferable to eliminate racism (2004: 155), but given how entrenched\nit is in many societies, he considers whether we might want to allow\nsome genetic interventions (e.g., engineering lighter skin tone) that\ncould help individuals avoid suffering from it. On this view, the use\nof reprogenetic technologies to select or edit certain traits could be\nhelpful at least in the short term, as it would help reduce some\nnear-term suffering, and the social solutions are distant and rather\nunlikely. Ultimately, however, he claims that we should not allow this\nkind of genetic engineering \u2013 not simply because it seems to\ncollude with a morally defective social environment, but because it\nreinforces and perhaps exacerbates that environment (it undermines work\ntoward changing the morally defective social environment) (2004:\n156\u2013157). Liberal states remain neutral about what constitutes\nthe good life, but impose certain restrictions (laws, policies) and\noffer education or aid (public health campaigns, food stamps) in the\nname of ensuring that citizens are safe, relatively stable, and have\nequal opportunity to pursue their goals.\n\n\nCritics, however, fear that regulations put in\nplace by advocates \u2013 whether in the form of laws, restrictions of\nthe use of federal or state funds, or mere recommendations or\nguidelines from medical societies \u2013 will not be sufficient to avoid\nthe negative consequences of eugenic practices (Duster 1990; Sparrow\n2011a). They point out the many ways that a collection of individual\nchoices, pressured by unjust social norms and assumptions, may lead to\nresults not wholly unlike those of the old eugenics programs.\n\n\nGreen (2007) also recommends against interventions\nthat would reinforce or increase discrimination, economic inequality,\nor racism (2007: 216\u2013226), but he does so with some reservations.\nParents understandably might want to reduce social burdens on their\nchildren through genetic interventions, he believes, and if we make\ndoing so illegal, they will likely go elsewhere or underground to get\nwhat they want. He also \u2013 optimistically \u2013 suggests that\nstereotypes and fashions ebb and flow and may be self-corrective (2007:\n227). Groups who have experienced significant discrimination over many\ngenerations will understandably reject such optimism. Indeed, the\ninsufficient progress made against these social ills and the historical\nevidence arguably calls for all of us to be skeptical of this\noptimism.\n\n\nSome have denied that social injustice could\nresult from selecting or editing for particular traits that increase\npeople\u2019s chances at a better life (Savulescu 2001). To the extent\nthat those traits contribute to inequality, the argument goes, it is\nunlikely that they could promote wellbeing (Savulescu 2001, 424). This\nclaim seems, however, either irrelevant or false (de Melo-Martin 2017).\nProspective parents choosing certain traits for their children could do\nso without realizing that they are actually undermining their\nchildren\u2019s wellbeing (see Anomaly 2020, a proponent of liberal\neugenics, who explicitly acknowledges coordination problems resulting\nfrom prospective parents\u2019 choices \u2013 although he does not\ndiscuss choices that might increase sexism or racism). For instance, in\na sexist society where parents systematically select for boys, it might\nbe the case that the wellbeing of those boys could diminish because of\nthe effects in society of fewer females. However, parents will realize\nthis only once the choices contributing to injustice have already been\nmade. But quite likely the claim is simply false. Consider racists\nsocieties. It is implausible that the selection of fair-skinned\nchildren in such societies would ever contribute to either a decrease\nin wellbeing for fair-skinned selected children or a decrease in social\ninjustices against those with darker skin (Sparrow 2007).\n\n\nIn some cases, liberal eugenics proponents simply\nbite the bullet and argue that social injustices should be addressed by\nchanging the social context rather than by constraining peoples\u2019\nreproductive choices (Savulescu 2001; Harris 2007; Savulescu and Kahane\n2009). For them, prospective parents have a moral requirement to\ncreate the best child even if doing so results in social\ninjustice. Savulescu and Kahane, for example, maintain that\nrestricting access to reprogenetic interventions regarding sex,\nsexuality, or skin color, in order to ensure that unjust norms are not\npromoted is not justified. Indeed, Savulescu explicitly maintains that\nprospective parents have a moral obligation to select the best child,\neven if doing so increases social injustices (Savulescu 2001). For\nthese proponents, society should address the unfair treatment of\nvarious groups, but they believe it should not be done through\nregulation of reproductive decision-making. Reproduction should not\nbecome an instrument of social change, at least not mediated or\nmotivated at a social level.\n",
