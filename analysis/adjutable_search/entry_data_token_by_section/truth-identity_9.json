    "main_text": "Difficulties with the Theory and Possible Solutions || The individuation problem\n5.6 Truth and Intrinsicism\n\nThe solutions to these problems, if judged satisfactory, seem to\ndirect us to a conception of truth that has been called\n\u201cintrinsicist\u201d (Wright 1999: 207\u20139), and\n\u201cprimitivist\u201d (Candlish 1999b: 207). This was a conception\nrecognized by Moore and Russell who, in the period when they were\nsympathetic to the identity theory, spoke of truth as a simple and\nunanalysable property (Moore 1953: 261; 1993: 20\u20131; Russell\n1973: 75; Cartwright 1987: 72\u20135; Johnston 2013: 384). The point\nhere would be as follows. There are particular, individual\nexplanations of the truth of many propositions. For example, the true\nproposition that there was a fire in the building will be explained by\nalluding to the presence of combustible material, enough oxygen, a\nspark caused by a short-circuit, etc. So, case by case, we will (at\nleast often) be able to provide explanations why given propositions\nare true, and science is expanding the field of such explanations all\nthe time. But according to the intrinsicist, there is no prospect of\nproviding a general explanation of truth, in the sense of an\naccount that would explain, in utterly general terms, why any\ntrue proposition was true. At that general level, according to the\nintrinsicist, there is nothing interesting to be said about what makes\ntrue propositions true: there are only the detailed case-histories. An\nintrinsicist may embrace one or another version of the identity theory\nof truth: what has to be rejected is the idea that the truth of a true\nproposition might consist in a relation to a distinct\nfact\u2014that the truth of the true proposition that Socrates is\nwise, for example, might consist in anything other than\nidentity with the fact that Socrates is wise. On this\napproach, truth is held to be both intrinsic to propositions, and\n primitive.[16]\n Intrinsicism was not a popular position, at least until recently:\nCandlish described it as \u201cso implausible that almost no one else\n[apart from Russell, in 1903\u20134] has been able to take it\nseriously\u201d (1999b: 208); but it may be gaining in popularity now\n(see, e.g., Asay 2013).\n\nCandlish (1999b: 208) thinks that intrinsicism and the identity theory\nare competitors, but perhaps that view is not mandatory. Intrinsicism\nsays that truth is a simple and unanalysable property of propositions;\nthe identity theory says that a true proposition is identical with a\nfact (and with the right fact). These statements will seem to clash\nonly if the identity theory is taken to propound a heavy-duty analysis\nof truth. But if, following recent exponents of the theory, we take it\nrather to be merely spelling out a connection between two entities\nthat we have in our ontology anyway, namely true propositions and\nfacts, and which turn out (like Hesperus and Phosphorus) to be\nidentical, on the basis of a realization that an entity like that\nSocrates is wise is both a true proposition and a fact, then any\nincipient clash between intrinsicism and the identity theory will, it\nseems, be averted. On this approach, a natural thing to say will be\nthat the identity theory describes the way in which truth is\na simple and unanalysable property.\n",
