His doctrine\ndepends on Richard Fitzralph\u2019s theory, according to which the\noriginal lordship is independent of natural and civil circumstances\n(on Fitzralph\u2019s conception see Robson 1961, pp. 70\u201396),\nand is only a particular application of Wyclif\u2019s general view on\nelection and damnation. In fact, the three main theses of the first\nbook of his De civili dominio are the following:\n\na man in sin has no right to dominion;\na man who is in a state of grace possesses all the goods of the\nworld;\nas a consequence, there can be no dominion without grace as its\nformal cause (De civili dominio, vol. 1, p 1).\n\n\nWyclif defines dominion as the right to exercise authority and,\nindirectly, to hold property. According to him, there are three kinds\nof possession: natural, civil, and evangelical. Natural possession is\nthe simple possession of goods without any legal title. Civil\npossession is the possession of goods on the basis of some civil law.\nEvangelical possession requires, beyond civil possession, a state of\ngrace in the legal owner. Thus God alone can confer evangelical\npossession (ibid., p. 45). On the other hand, a man in a\nstate of grace is lord of the visible universe, but on the condition\nthat he shares his lordship with all the other men who are in a state\nof grace, as all men in a state of grace have the same rights. This\nultimately means that all the goods of God should be in common, just\nas they were before the Fall. Private property was introduced as a\nresult of sin. From this point of view it is also evident that\nAristotle\u2019s criticisms against Plato are unsound, since Platonic\ncommunism is correct in essence (ibid., pp. 96 ff.). The\npurpose of civil law is to preserve the necessities of life\n(ibid., pp. 128\u201329). The best form of government is\nmonarchy. Kings must be obeyed and have taxes paid to them, even if\nthey become tyrants, since they are God\u2019s vicars that He alone\ncan depose \u2014 so that only secular lordship is justified in the\nworld (ibid., p. 201).\n",
