    "main_text": "Complementarity\n4. Complementarity\n\nAfter Heisenberg had managed to formulate a consistent quantum\nmechanics in 1925, both he and Bohr began their struggle to find a\ncoherent interpretation for the mathematical formalism. Heisenberg and\nBohr followed somewhat different approaches. Where Heisenberg looked\nto the formalism and developed his famous uncertainty principle or\nindeterminacy relation, Bohr chose to analyze concrete experimental\narrangements, especially the double-slit experiment. In a way Bohr\nmerely regarded Heisenberg\u2019s relation as an expression of his\ngeneral notion that our understanding of atomic phenomena builds on\ncomplementary descriptions. At Como in 1927 he presented for the first\ntime his ideas according to which certain different descriptions are\nsaid to be complementary.\n\nBohr pointed to two sets of descriptions which he took to be\ncomplementary. On the one hand, there are those that attribute either\nkinematic or dynamic properties to the atom; that is,\n\u201cspace-time descriptions\u201d are complementary to\n\u201cclaims of causality\u201d, where Bohr interpreted the causal\nclaims in physics in terms of the conservation of energy and momentum.\nOn the other hand, there are those descriptions that ascribe either\nwave or particle properties to a single object. How these two kinds of\ncomplementary sets of descriptions are related is something Bohr never\nindicated (Murdoch 1987). Even among people, like Rosenfeld and Pais,\nwho claimed to speak on behalf of Bohr, there is no agreement. The\nfact is that the description of light as either particles or waves was\nalready a classical dilemma, which not even Einstein\u2019s\ndefinition of a photon really solved since the momentum of the photon\nas a particle depends on the frequency of the light as a wave.\nFurthermore, Bohr eventually realized that the attribution of\nkinematic and dynamic properties to an object is complementary because\nthe ascription of both of these conjugate variables rests on mutually\nexclusive experiments. The attribution of particle and wave properties\nto an object may, however, occur in a single experiment; for instance,\nin the double-slit experiment where the interference pattern consists\nof single dots. So within less than ten years after his Como lecture\nBohr tacitly abandoned \u201cwave-particle complementarity\u201d in\nfavor of the exclusivity of \u201ckinematic-dynamic\ncomplementarity\u201d (Held 1994).\n\nIt was clear to Bohr that any interpretation of the atomic world had\nto take into account an important empirical fact. The discovery of the\nquantization of action meant that quantum mechanics could not fulfill\nthe above principles of classical physics. Every time we measure, say,\nan electron\u2019s position, the apparatus and the electron interact\nin an uncontrollable way, so that we are unable to measure the\nelectron\u2019s momentum at the same time. Until the mid-1930s when\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen published their famous thought-experiment\nwith the intention of showing that quantum mechanics was incomplete,\nBohr spoke as if the measurement apparatus disturbed the electron.\nThis paper had a significant influence on Bohr\u2019s line of\nthought. Apparently, Bohr realized that speaking of disturbance seemed\nto indicate\u2014as some of his opponents may have understood\nhim\u2014that atomic objects were classical particles with definite\ninherent kinematic and dynamic properties. After the EPR paper he\nstated quite clearly: \u201cthe whole situation in atomic physics\ndeprives of all meaning such inherent attributes as the idealization\nof classical physics would ascribe to such objects.\u201d\n\nHence, according to Bohr, the state of the measuring device and the\nstate of the object cannot be separated from each other during a\nmeasurement but they form a dynamical whole. Bohr called this form of\nholism \u201cthe individuality\u201d of the atomic process. Thereby,\nhe had in mind not only that the interaction is uncontrollable but\nalso that the system-cum-measurement forms an inseparable unity due to\nthe entanglement \u2013 although Bohr\u2019s did not use this term\n(Faye 1991, 1994; Howard 1994, 2004).\n\nAlso after the EPR paper Bohr spoke about Heisenberg\u2019s\n\u201cindeterminacy relation\u201d as indicating the ontological\nconsequences of his claim that kinematic and dynamic variables are\nill-defined unless they refer to an experimental outcome. Earlier he\nhad often called it Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\nrelation\u201d, as if it were a question of a merely epistemological\nlimitation. Furthermore, Bohr no longer mentioned descriptions as\nbeing complementary, but rather phenomena or information. He\nintroduced the definition of a \u201cphenomenon\u201d as requiring a\ncomplete description of the entire experimental arrangement, and he\ntook a phenomenon to be a measurement of the values of either\nkinematic or dynamic properties.\n\nBohr\u2019s more mature view, i.e., his view after the EPR paper, on\ncomplementarity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics may be\nsummarized in the following points:\n\nThe interpretation of a physical theory has to rely on an\nexperimental practice.\nThe experimental practice presupposes a certain pre-scientific\npractice of description, which establishes the norm for experimental\nmeasurement apparatus, and consequently what counts as scientific\nexperience.\nOur pre-scientific practice of understanding our environment is an\nadaptation to the sense experience of separation, orientation,\nidentification and reidentification over time of physical\nobjects.\nThis pre-scientific experience is grasped in terms of common\ncategories like thing\u2019s position and change of position,\nduration and change of duration, and the relation of cause and effect,\nterms and principles that are now parts of our common language.\nThese common categories yield the preconditions for objective\nknowledge, and any description of nature has to use these concepts to\nbe objective.\nThe concepts of classical physics are merely exact specifications\nof the above categories.\nThe classical concepts\u2014and not classical physics\nitself\u2014are therefore necessary in any description of physical\nexperience in order to understand what we are doing and to be able to\ncommunicate our results to others, in particular in the description of\nquantum phenomena as they present themselves in experiments;\nPlanck\u2019s empirical discovery of the quantization of action\nrequires a revision of the foundation for the use of classical\nconcepts, because they are not all applicable at the same time. Their\nuse is well defined only if they apply to experimental interactions in\nwhich the quantization of action can be regarded as negligible.\nIn experimental cases where the quantization of action plays a\nsignificant role, the application of a classical concept does not\nrefer to independent properties of the object; rather the ascription\nof either kinematic or dynamic properties to the object as it exists\nindependently of a specific experimental interaction is\nill-defined.\nThe quantization of action demands a limitation of the use of\nclassical concepts so that these concepts apply only to a phenomenon,\nwhich Bohr understood as the macroscopic manifestation of a\nmeasurement on the object, i.e. the uncontrollable interaction between\nthe object and the apparatus.\nThe quantum mechanical description of the object differs from the\nclassical description of the measuring apparatus, and this requires\nthat the object and the measuring device should be separated in the\ndescription, but the line of separation is not the one between\nmacroscopic instruments and microscopic objects. It has been argued in\ndetail (Howard 1994) that Bohr pointed out that parts of the measuring\ndevice may sometimes be treated as parts of the object in the quantum\nmechanical description.\nThe quantum mechanical formalism does not provide physicists with\na \u2018pictorial\u2019 representation: the \u03c8-function\ndoes not, as Schr\u00f6dinger had hoped, represent a new kind of\nreality. Instead, as Born suggested, the square of the absolute value\nof the \u03c8-function expresses a probability amplitude for\nthe outcome of a measurement. Due to the fact that the wave equation\ninvolves an imaginary quantity this equation can have only a symbolic\ncharacter, but the formalism may be used to predict the outcome of a\nmeasurement that establishes the conditions under which concepts like\nposition, momentum, time and energy apply to the phenomena.\nThe ascription of these classical concepts to the phenomena of\nmeasurements rely on the experimental context of the phenomena, so\nthat the entire setup provides us with the defining conditions for the\napplication of kinematic and dynamic concepts in the domain of quantum\nphysics.\nSuch phenomena are complementary in the sense that their\nmanifestations depend on mutually exclusive measurements, but that the\ninformation gained through these various experiments exhausts all\npossible objective knowledge of the object.\n\n\nBohr thought of the atom as real. Atoms are neither heuristic nor\nlogical constructions. A couple of times he emphasized this directly\nusing arguments from experiments in a very similar way to Ian Hacking\nand Nancy Cartwright much later. What he did not believe was that the\nquantum mechanical formalism was true in the sense that it gave us a\nliteral (\u2018pictorial\u2019) rather than a symbolic\nrepresentation of the quantum world. It makes much sense to\ncharacterize Bohr in modern terms as an entity realist who opposes\ntheory realism (Folse 1986; Faye 1991). \n\nIt is because of the imaginary quantities in quantum mechanics (where\nthe commutation rule for canonically conjugate variable, p\nand q, introduces Planck\u2019s constant into the formalism\nby qp \u2212 pq = ih/2\u03c0 that quantum\nmechanics does not give us a \u2018pictorial\u2019 representation of\nthe world. Neither does the theory of relativity, Bohr argued, provide\nus with a literal representation, since the velocity of light is\nintroduced with a factor of i in the definition of the fourth\ncoordinate in a four-dimensional manifold (CC, p. 86 and p.\n105). Instead these theories can only be used symbolically to predict\nobservations under well-defined conditions. Therefore, many\nphilosophers have interpreted Bohr as an antirealist or an\ninstrumentalist when it comes to theories. However, Bohr\u2019s\nreference to the use of imaginary number in quantum mechanics as an\nargument for his rejection of a pictoral representation may seem\nmisplaced. The use of imaginary numbers is more a question about the\nconventional choice of scale whether measurements should be\nrepresented in terms of imaginary or real number than an indication of\na certain magnitude expressed in terms of these numbers is not real.\nDieks (2017) gives a nuanced discussion of Bohr\u2019s argument, and\nhe concludes that in the context of quantrum mechanics Bohr saw\nimaginary numbers to be associated with incompatible physical\nquantities. \n\nIn general, Bohr considered the demands of complementarity in quantum\nmechanics to be logically on a par with the requirements of relativity\nin the theory of relativity. He believed that both theories were a\nresult of novel aspects of the observation problem, namely the fact\nthat observation in physics is context-dependent. This again is due to\nthe existence of a maximum velocity of propagation of all actions in\nthe domain of relativity and a minimum of any action in the domain of\nquantum mechanics. And it is because of these universal limits that it\nis impossible in the theory of relativity to make an unambiguous\nseparation between time and space without reference to the observer\n(the context) and impossible in quantum mechanics to make a sharp\ndistinction between the behavior of the object and its interaction\nwith the means of observation (CC, p. 105).\n\nComplementarity is first and foremost a semantic and epistemological\nreading of quantum mechanics that carries certain ontological\nimplications. Bohr\u2019s view was, to phrase it in a modern\nphilosophical jargon, that the truth conditions of sentences ascribing\na certain kinematic or dynamic value to an atomic object are dependent\non the apparatus involved, in such a way that these truth conditions\nhave to include reference to the experimental setup as well as the\nactual outcome of the experiment. This claim is called Bohr\u2019s\nindefinability thesis (Murdoch 1987; Faye 1991). Hence, those\nphysicists who accuse this interpretation of operating with a\nmysterious collapse of the wave function during measurements\nhaven\u2019t got it right. Bohr accepted the Born statistical\ninterpretation because he believed that the \u03c8-function\nhas only a symbolic meaning and does not represent anything real. It\nmakes sense to talk about a collapse of the wave function only if, as\nBohr put it, the \u03c8-function can be given a pictorial\nrepresentation, something he strongly denied.\n\nIndeed, Bohr, Heisenberg, and many other physicists considered\ncomplementarity to be the only rational interpretation of the quantum\nworld. They thought that it gave us the understanding of atomic\nphenomena in accordance with the conditions for any physical\ndescription and the possible objective knowledge of the world. Bohr\nbelieved that atoms are real, but it remains a much debated point in\nrecent literature what sort of reality he believed them to have,\nwhether or not they are something beyond and different from what they\nare observed to be. Henry Folse argues that Bohr must operate with a\ndistinction between a phenomenal and a transcendental object. The\nreason is that this is the only way it makes sense to talk about the\nphysical disturbance of the atomic object by the measuring instrument\nas Bohr did for a while (Folse 1985, 1994). But Jan Faye has replied\nthat Bohr gave up the disturbance metaphor in connection with his\ndiscussion of the EPR thought-experiment because he realized that it\nwas misleading. Moreover, there is no further evidence in Bohr\u2019s\nwritings indicating that Bohr would attribute intrinsic and\nmeasurement-independent state properties to atomic objects (though\nquite unintelligible and inaccessible to us) in addition to the\nclassical ones being manifested in measurement (Faye 1991).\n",
