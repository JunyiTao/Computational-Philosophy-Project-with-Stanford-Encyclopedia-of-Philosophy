    "main_text": "Varieties of Pacifism || Absolute vs. Contingent Pacifism\n2.1 Absolute vs. Contingent Pacifism\n\nThis distinction organizes different answers to the question of how\nobligated we are to reject violence and war. Absolute pacifism is\nunderstood as a maximal and universal rejection of violence and war.\nAbsolutism in ethics (or moral absolutism) holds that moral principles\nare eternal and unchanging and that they admit no exceptions. So,\nabsolute pacifism holds that war and violence are always wrong. One\nrecent proponent of a version of absolute pacifism is Michael Allen\nFox. Fox argues that war is inconsistent with morality and with human\nwell-being. He concludes by asserting a \u201cvery strong form of\npacifism\u201d and admits that this results in some uncomfortable\nconclusions, such as that \u201ceven military action aimed at\nprotecting people against acute and systematic human-rights violations\ncannot be justified\u201d (Fox 2014, 126). Fox explains that pacifism\nresults in a difficult dilemma that is reminiscent of the question of\nwhether two wrongs can make a right. Fox asks, \u201cShould immoral\nactions be used to stop other (perhaps gravely more) immoral\nactions?\u201d(Fox 2014, 127). He answers \u201cNo,\u201d and\nmaintains that this shows us that we have to work to find ways to move\nbeyond our reliance on war as the solution to social and political\nproblems. A similar conclusion has been argued by Holmes who concludes\nthat morality and warfare are \u201cantithetical\u201d (Holmes 2017a\np.25).\n\nNon-absolute pacifism may be called contingent pacifism. While\nabsolute pacifism admits no exceptions to the rejection of war and\nviolence, contingent pacifism is usually understood as a principled\nrejection of a particular war. A different version of contingent\npacifism can also be understood to hold that pacifism is only an\nobligation for a particular group of individuals and not for everyone.\nContingent pacifism can also be a principled rejection of a particular\nmilitary system or set of military policies. Contingent pacifists may\naccept the permissibility or even necessity of war in some\ncircumstances and reject it in others, while absolute pacifists will\nalways and everywhere reject war and violence.\n\nAbsolute pacifism is often connected with a religious standpoint in\nwhich nonviolence is seen as a religious commandment. Thomas Merton\nexplains that Gandhi and most other absolute pacifists have a larger\nmetaphysical view: \u201cas Gandhi saw, the fully consistent practice\nof nonviolence demands a solid metaphysical basis both in being and in\nGod\u201d (Merton 1971, 209). There is an open question about how\n\u201cabsolute\u201d Gandhi was in his pacifism (Fiala 2022a), but it is\nclear that he is often viewed as a paradigmatic figure of what we\nAllen calls \u201cabsolute nonviolence\u201d (Allen 2022). In the West,\nabsolute pacifism is often derived from the Christian ideal of\nnonresistance to evil as required by Jesus\u2019 pronouncements about\nnonresistance in the Sermon on the Mount (in Matthew) or the Sermon on\nthe Plain (in Luke). In Indian traditions, it is grounded in the\ncommitment to ahimsa or nonviolence that is derived from a larger\nmetaphysical picture which emphasizes karmic interdependence, ascetic\nself-abnegation, and compassion. The religious foundation of absolute\npacifism is often tied to the idea that there is merit in suffering\nviolence without retaliating. As Martin Luther King Jr. puts this,\n\u201cunearned suffering is redemptive\u201d (King 1986, 18).\n\nAbsolute pacifism is an ideal. Some versions of absolute pacifism go\nso far as to abjure the idea of personal self-defense. Other absolute\npacifists may allow for personal self-defense while rejecting the\nimpersonal and political violence of war. Almost every defender of\nabsolute pacifism recognizes the difficulty of attaining to the\nabsolute idea. Gandhi writes the following in his autobiography:\n\u201cMan cannot for a moment live without consciously or\nunconsciously committing outward himsa (violence)\u2026 A\nvotary of ahimsa (nonviolence) therefore remains true to this\nfaith if the spring of all his actions is compassion, if he shuns to\nthe best of his ability the destruction of the tiniest creature, tries\nto save it, and thus incessantly strives to be free from the deadly\ncoil of himsa. He will be constantly growing in self-restraint and\ncompassion, but he can never become entirely free from outward\nhimsa\u201d (Gandhi 1993, 439). The absolute ideal is nearly\nimpossible to achieve because we must harm other beings in order to\nsurvive: we must kill in order to eat. And the world often presents us\nwith difficult \u201ckill or be killed\u201d choices as in the\nquestion of self-defense or war. Absolute pacifists may hold that it\nis better to be killed than to kill. But such a choice may be\nimpossible for many of us to make. Pacifists will often argue that\nthis way of describing a situation\u2014as one where the choice is\n\u201ckill or be killed\u201d\u2014usually presents us with a false\ndilemma: often there are other nonviolent alternatives to either\nkilling or being killed. But when presented with such a stark choice,\nabsolute pacifism may require self-sacrifice.\n\nContingent or conditional pacifism qualifies such an uncompromising\ncondemnation of violence and warfare. Albert Einstein and Bertrand\nRussell, for example, were both supporters of the war against Nazi\nGermany, despite the fact that each considered himself to be a\npacifist. Russell identified his position as what he called\n\u201crelative political pacifism\u201d (Russell 1943). Russell uses\nthe word \u201crelative\u201d to describe the contingent nature of\nthe commitment to peace: one\u2019s commitment to pacifism depends\nupon or is relative to the nature of the war. Relative pacifism means,\nfor Russell, \u201cthat very few wars are worth fighting,\nand that the evils of war are almost always greater than they\nseem to excited populations at the moment when war breaks out\u201d\n(Russell 1943, 8). Russell calls his position \u201cpolitical\u201d\nbecause his emphasis is on war and political institutions, not on a\npersonal commitment to nonviolence.\n\nAlong these lines, David Cortright has described what he calls\n\u201crealistic pacifism.\u201d Cortright claims that in the realm\nof nuclear war, pacifism is absolute. But in other sorts of conflict,\npacifism is \u201cconditional and pragmatic\u201d and\n\u201cpredicated on a presumption against armed violence, but it\nacknowledges that the use of force, constrained by rigorous ethical\nstandards, may be necessary at times for self-defense and the\nprotection of the innocent\u201d (Cortright 2008, 334). Such an idea\nis clearly related to just war theory. Indeed, some authors (such as\nLarry May) have derived contingent pacifism from just war\nthinking.\n\nThere are several varieties of contingent pacifism. A basic\ndistinction to be made here is whether one\u2019s argument against a\ngiven war is is merely occasional or situational (what we might call a\ncontingently pacifist argument against a given war); or whether one is\noffering a broader argument against wars of a certain type or wars\nthat are generally fought under certain conditions (see Fiala 2014;\nMorrow 2017).\n\nFirst, pacifism may not be required of all moral agents. Thus pacifism\nmay only be required for members of particular professions. Pacifism\nis often thought to be a professional obligation of certain religious\nvocations. But such a vocation may be thought of as a choice of\nconscience that is not universally required. In this version of\ncontingent pacifism, the prohibition against violence only applies to\nthose who take a vow or make a pledge to renounce violence and war.\nWithin this two-tiered approach, the vow of peacefulness might be\nconsidered as a sort of supererogatory ideal that is not required of\nothers. But it is also possible for the two-tier approach to contain\nan implicit condemnation of those who do not take up the higher\ncalling of pacifism.\n\nA second sort of contingent pacifism holds that if a particular war or\nmilitary policy is prudentially unwise it should be resisted. Such\nprudential pacifism is based upon cost-benefit analyses focused on the\nfacts of particular conflicts. A more principled sort of prudential\npacifism can be based upon the general claim that war usually causes\nmore harm than good.\n\nA third sort of contingent pacifism will appeal to the just war theory\nand claim that a given war is unjust according to this theory. As John\nRawls says of what he calls \u201ccontingent pacifism,\u201d\n\u201cthe possibility of a just war is conceded but not under present\ncircumstances\u201d (Rawls 1971, 382). This idea is closely related\nto \u201cjust war pacifism\u201d as developed in the last couple of\ndecades by critics of the just war tradition: just war pacifism\nmaintains that modern wars are not fought according to the standards\nof the just war theory because, for example, they make use of aerial\nbombardment and other means that do not adequately discriminate\nbetween combatants and noncombatants. Such a claim may result in a\nnearly absolute proscription against war under present circumstances.\nAnd it may contain an absolute prohibition against certain sorts of\nwar, such as nuclear war. Most so-called \u201cjust war\npacifists\u201d are contingent pacifists in this sense: they object\nto the way modern wars are fought.\n\nWith the just war theory in mind, contingent pacifism may focus either\non the basis for war (as in the just war idea of jus ad\nbellum), on the way that the war is being fought (as in the just\nwar idea of jus in bello), or on the expected outcome of the\nwar (as in the idea of jus post bellum). With regard to\njus ad bellum, contingent pacifists may reject the legitimacy\nof the authority who is fighting, they may claim that war is not being\nfought as a last resort, or they may deny that the war is being fought\nfor a just cause. With regard to jus in bello, contingent\npacifist may worry that innocent noncombatants are being harmed or\nthat soldiers are employing means mala in se (such as rape or\ntorture). Finally, with regard to jus post bellum, contingent\npacifists may object to wars that will undermine long-term peace,\njustice, and stability.\n\nA fourth form of contingent pacifism might be called \u201cpolitical\npacifism.\u201d This approach adheres to pacifism as a strategic\npolitical commitment within an adversarial system. In political\ndiscourse, the so-called \u201cdoves\u201d are usually not absolute\npacifists. Rather, they define themselves in opposition to the\n\u201chawks\u201d who advocate war and funding for the war-system.\nPolitical pacifists need not have an absolute commitment to\nnonviolence; nor need they have a principled commitment to the ideas\nof the just war theory. Rather, they can reject militaristic policies\nfor strategic political purposes that have to do with budget\npriorities or other issues. Political pacifism may seem to be merely\nopportunistic; but opposition parties who offer critical perspectives\non militarism are an important component of adversarial democracy.\nMoreover, political pacifists can end up forming useful coalitions\nwith other more principled pacifists and absolute pacifists.\n\nFinally, another version of contingent pacifism can be called,\nfollowing Robert Holmes, \u201cliberal-democratic\u201d or\n\u201cliberal pacifism.\u201d Holmes argues that modern warfare runs\ncounter to the values of liberal-democracy. Thus those who are\ncommitted to liberal values should not support war. Essential for this\nclaim is the idea that \u201cno one has a right to command others to\nkill, and no one is justified in killing on command\u201d (Holmes\n1999, 398). The sort of pacifism that is derived from this claim is\ncontingent upon the fact that modern warfare involves a hierarchically\norganized military system and mass conscription. It is possible that\nwar could be fought without conscription or without military\nhierarchy; but Holmes argues that this is unlikely in the modern\nworld. Moreover, this sort of pacifism is contingent upon our social\nand political commitments. Those who are committed to other social and\npolitical ideologies may find that war and the war system are morally\nand politically acceptable.\n\nContingent pacifism is often based upon empirical and historical\njudgments about the way wars are fought. Such judgments will vary\ndepending upon changing circumstances. And these judgments are also\ncontingent upon the availability of information about why and how wars\nare fought. It is possible, then, that contingent pacifists can admit\nthat there may be conflicting judgments about the justice of a\nparticular war. Unlike contingent pacifism, absolute pacifism rejects\nwar in an a priori fashion: one of the first principles of absolute\npacifism is that war (or violence more generally) is always wrong.\nThus absolute pacifism will claim that any judgment that leads to the\njustification of war is wrong.\n",
