How should a rational player incorporate the\ninformation that more than one action is classified as\n\u201cchoice-worthy\u201d or \u201crationally permissible\u201d\n(according to some choice rule) for her opponent(s)? In such a\nsituation, it is natural to require that the player does not rule\nout the possibility that her opponent will pick a\n\u201cchoice-worthy\u201d option. More generally, the players should\nbe \u201ccautious\u201d about which of their opponents\u2019\noptions they rule out.\nAssuming that the players\u2019 beliefs are \u201ccautious\u201d\nis naturally related to weak dominance (recall the characterization of\nweak dominance, Section 3.2\nin which a strategy is weakly dominated iff it does not maximize\nexpected utility with respect to any full support probability\nmeasure). A key issue in epistemic game theory is the epistemic\nanalysis of iterated removal of weakly dominated strategies. Many\nauthors have pointed out puzzles surrounding such an analysis (Asheim\n& Dufwenberg 2003; Brandenburger, Friedenberg & Keisler 2008;\nCubitt & Sugden 1994; Samuelson 1992). For example, Samuelson\n(1992) showed (among other things) that the analogue of Theorem 4.1 is\nnot true for iterated removal of weakly dominated strategies. The main\nproblem is illustrated by the following game:\n\n\n \u00a0 Bob \nAnn \n\nl r\nu 1,1  1,0 \nd 1,0  0,1 \n\n\n\nFigure 22\n\nIn the above game, \\(d\\) is weakly dominated by \\(u\\) for Ann. If Bob\nknows that Ann is rational (in the sense that she will not choose a\nweakly dominated strategy), then he can rule out option \\(d\\). In the\nsmaller game, action \\(r\\) is now strictly dominated by \\(l\\) for Bob. If\nAnn knows that Bob is rational and that Bob knows that she is rational\n(and so, rules out option \\(d\\)), then she can rule out option\n\\(r\\). Assuming that the above reasoning is transparent to both Ann and\nBob, it is common knowledge that Ann will play \\(u\\) and Bob will play\n\\(l\\). But now, what is the reason for Bob to rule out the possibility\nthat Ann will play \\(d\\)? He knows that Ann knows that he is going to\nplay \\(l\\) and both \\(u\\) and \\(d\\) are best responses to \\(l\\). The problem\nis that assuming that the players\u2019 beliefs are cautious\nconflicts with the logic of iterated removal of weakly dominated\nstrategies. This issue is nicely described in a well-known microeconomics\ntextbook:\n\n[T]he argument for deletion of a weakly dominated strategy for\nplayer \\(i\\) is that he contemplates the possibility that every strategy\ncombination of his rivals occurs with positive probability. However,\nthis hypothesis clashes with the logic of iterated deletion, which\nassumes, precisely that eliminated strategies are not expected to\noccur. (Mas-Colell, Winston, & Green 1995: 240)\n\nThe extent of this conflict is nicely illustrated in Samuelson\n(1992). In particular, Samuelson (1992) shows that there is no\nepistemic-probability \nmodel[14]\n of the above game with\na state satisfying common knowledge of rationality (where\n\u201crationality\u201d means that players do not choose weakly\ndominated strategies). Prima facie, this is puzzling: What\nabout the epistemic-probability model consisting of a single state \\(w\\)\nassigned the profile \\((u, l)\\)? Isn\u2019t this a model of the above\ngame where there is a state satisfying common knowledge that the\nplayers do not choose weakly dominated strategies? The problem is that\nthe players do not have \u201ccautious\u201d beliefs in this model\n(in particular, Bob\u2019s beliefs are not cautious in the sense\ndescribed below). Recall that having a cautious belief means that a\nplayer cannot know which options her opponent(s)\nwill \npick[15]\n from a set of choice-worthy options (in the\nabove game, if Ann knows that Bob is choosing \\(l\\), then both\n\\(u\\) and \\(d\\) are \u201cchoice-worthy\u201d, so Bob\ncannot know that Ann is choosing \\(u\\)). This suggests an\nadditional requirement on a game model: Let \\(\\M=\\epprobmodel\\) be an\nepistemic-probability model. For each action \\(a\\in \\cup_{i\\in\\Agt}\nS_i\\), let \\({[\\![{a}]\\!]}=\\{w \\mid (\\sigma(w))_i=a\\}\\).\nIf \\(a\\in S_i\\) is rational for player \\(i\\) at state\n\\(w\\), then for all players \\(j\\ne i\\), \\({[\\![{a}]\\!]}\\cap \\Pi_j(w)\\ne\n\\emptyset\\).\nThis means that a player cannot know that her opponent\nwill not choose an action at a state \\(w\\) which is deemed rational\n(according to some choice rule). This property is called\n\u201cprivacy of tie-breaking\u201d by Cubitt and Sugden (2011: 8)\nand \u201cno extraneous beliefs\u201d by Asheim and Dufwenberg\n(2003).[16]\n For an extended discussion of the above\nassumption see Cubitt & Sugden (2011).\nGiven the above considerations, the epistemic analysis of iterated\nweak dominance is not a straightforward adaptation of the analysis of\niterated strict dominance discussed in the previous section. In\nparticular, any such analysis must resolve the conflict between\nstrategic reasoning where players rule out certain strategy\nchoices of their opponent(s) and admissibility considerations where\nplayers must consider all of their opponents\u2019\noptions possible. A number of authors have developed\nframeworks that do resolve this conflict (Brandenburger et al. 2008;\nAsheim & Dufwenberg 2003; Halpern & Pass 2009). We sketch one\nof these solutions below:\nThe key idea is to represent the players\u2019 beliefs as\na lexicographic probability system (LPS). An LPS is a finite\nsequence of probability measures \\((p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n)\\) with supports\n(The support of a probability measure \\(p\\) defined on\na set of states \\(W\\) is the set of all states that have nonzero\nprobability; formally, \\(Supp(p)=\\{w \\mid p(w)>0\\}\\)) that do not\noverlap. This is interpreted as follows: if \\((p_1,\\ldots,p_n)\\)\nrepresents Ann\u2019s beliefs, then \\(p_1\\) is Ann\u2019s\n\u201cinitial hypothesis\u201d about what Bob is going to do, \\(p_2\\)\nis Ann\u2019s secondary hypothesis, and so on. In the above game, we\ncan describe Bob\u2019s beliefs as follows: his initial hypothesis\nis that Ann will choose \\(U\\) with probability 1 and his secondary\nhypothesis is that she will choose \\(D\\) with probability 1. The\ninterpretation is that, although Bob does not rule out the possibility\nthat Ann will choose \\(D\\) (i.e., choose irrationally), he does consider\nit infinitely less likely than her choosing \\(U\\) (i.e.,\nchoosing rationally).\nSo, representing beliefs as lexicographic probability measures\nresolves the conflict between strategic reasoning and the assumption\nthat players do not play weakly dominated strategies. However, there\nis another, more fundamental, issue that arises in the epistemic\nanalysis of iterated weak dominance:\n\nUnder admissibility, Ann considers everything possible. But this is\nonly a decision-theoretic statement. Ann is in a game, so we imagine\nshe asks herself: \u201cWhat about Bob? What does he consider\npossible?\u201d If Ann truly considers everything possible, then it\nseems she should, in particular, allow for the possibility that Bob\ndoes not! Alternatively put, it seems that a full analysis of the\nadmissibility requirement should include the idea that other players\ndo not conform to the requirement.  (Brandenburger et al. 2008:\n313)\n\nThere are two main ingredients to the epistemic characterization of\niterated weak dominance. The first is to represent the players\u2019\nbeliefs as lexicographic probability systems. The second is to use a\nstronger notion of belief: A player assumes an event\n\\(E\\) provided \\(E\\) is infinitely more likely than \\(\\overline{E}\\) (on\nfinite spaces, this means each state in \\(E\\) is infinitely more likely\nthan states not in \\(E\\)). The key question is: What is the precise\nrelationship between the event \u201crationality and common\nassumption of rationality\u201d and the strategies that survive\niterated removal of weakly dominated strategies? The precise answer\nturns out to be surprisingly subtle\u2014the details are beyond the\nscope of this article (see Brandenburger et al. 2008).\n",
