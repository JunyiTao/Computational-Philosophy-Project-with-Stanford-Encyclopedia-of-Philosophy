    "main_text": "Phenomenologies of Race and Racism || Multiple Racisms\n2.1 Multiple Racisms\n\nPhenomenological approaches to race also helped to disaggregate the\nexperiences of diverse racial identities as well as expose the diverse\nforms of racism. Liberalism generally defines racism as the result of\nan illegitimate racial consciousness or racial awareness, in which the\nrace of an individual is noted and taken to be significant, setting\naside the question of who is noting who or how the significance is\nunderstood. By decontextualizing racism in this way it is rendered a\nuniform practice that could be philosophically treated in the abstract,\nwith generic solutions. By contrast, phenomenological approaches have\nsuggested that white practices of racial consciousness, among others,\nneed a distinct analysis (Sullivan 2006). White racial consciousness\noften involves self-attributions of innocence, wilful ignorance about\nrace-related social realities, and a sense of spatial entitlement that\nSullivan names \u201contological expansiveness.\u201d\n\nWhile there are some similarities in racist habits\u2014such as forms\nof group-based antipathy, denigration, and essentialism\u2014there are\nalso differences important in understanding our experiences. The very\nterm \u201canti-black racism\u201d Gordon developed indicated that\nhis analysis was not meant to be generic but specific, attending to the\nmanifestations of racism that emerge from the specific histories of\nslavery, Jim Crow, and the ongoing colonization of Africa. Emily Lee\nand David Haekwon Kim have used phenomenonological approaches to\nexplore the particularities of anti-Asian racism, Asian American\nassimilation and the idea of Asian-Americans as \u201cmodel\nminorities,\u201d in which the natural attitude of whites directs a\ndifferent set of expectations and normative judgements toward Asians\nbut ones that continue to curtail both individual and collective agency\n(Kim 2014; Lee 2020).\n\nEven when racism involves a negative projection, there is also\nalways a positive ideal against which the negative projection is\nidentifiable. The criminal black person is contrasted with the\ncompliant black, the lazy Mexican is contrasted with the hard-working\nMexican, and so on. For Asian Americans, Kim argues, the natural\nattitude of whites expects passivity, with the result that nonpassive\nAsians appear to be seeking dominance, even if their non-passivity is\nmerely sticking \u201cto an unpopular proposal in a committee\nmeeting\u201d (Kim 2020, 297). Asian assertiveness disrupts some\npeople\u2019s comfort and reveals their commitment to the idea that\nAsians are \u201csocially passive\u201d (ibid). Such attitudes are\nnot caused exclusively by cognitive commitments but operate as\naffective states that play a formative role in desire as well as\nunderstanding, such as the desirability of Asian passivity.\n\nMartin Heidegger\u2019s concept of Dasein, or \u201cbeing\nthere,\u201d understands temporal and spatial location to be\nconstitutive of subjectivity. This has provided a helpful elucidation\nof immigrant, bilingual, multilingual, and transnational experiences of\nidentity, such as many Latinx people experience, among others.\nDasein\u2019s experience of being at home in the world and being with\nothers in a comfortably collective \u201cwe\u201d state is disrupted\nby angst when the ease of this connectedness is broken by migration and\nracism. Mariana Ortega makes use of Heidegger\u2019s approach to develop\na phenomenology of migrant life, a life in which the experience of\nat-homeness is never more than fleeting. This experience disrupts the\nsolidity of the natural attitude and can lead to a critical\nconsciousness. European male existentialists sometimes portrayed the\nself as normally unreflective, with the secure ease of practical\nfunctionality within their worlds, until a crisis, such as the Nazi\noccupation of France, forces reflexivity and a new awareness of what\nhad been taken for granted. Ortega argues that the mestiza and the\nmigrant live in an everyday world of ambiguities, uncertainties of\nmeaning, and contradictory norms of practice, resulting in a\ndiscontinuous and multiplicitous self that requires a new\nphenomenological analysis (Ortega 2016, 50; see also Schutte 2000).\n",
