    "main_text": "The Concept of Taste\n1. The Concept of Taste\n\nThe concept of the aesthetic descends from the concept of taste. Why\nthe concept of taste commanded so much philosophical attention during\nthe 18th century is a complicated matter, but this much is clear: the\neighteenth-century theory of taste emerged, in part, as a corrective\nto the rise of rationalism, particularly as applied to beauty, and to\nthe rise of egoism, particularly as applied to virtue. Against\nrationalism about beauty, the eighteenth-century theory of taste held\nthe judgment of beauty to be immediate; against egoism about virtue,\nit held the pleasure of beauty to be disinterested.\n",
