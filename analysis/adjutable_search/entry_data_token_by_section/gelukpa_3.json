Buddhist Context of Geluk Philosophy\n\nIt is important to recognize how Geluk philosophy is embedded within a\ndistinctively Buddhist soteriology. That is, the truth of no-self is\nliberating because understanding this is held to free one from the\nmistaken idea of a self that binds one to suffering. Knowledge of\nemptiness is key to this emancipatory process, as Tsongkhapa claims,\nfor one must realize emptiness as it is articulated in the Consequence\nSchool, the lack of true essence, to be free from the subtle sense of\nself and achieve nirv\u0101\u1e47a (Cozort 1998, 316). This view is\nalso maintained to be a prerequisite for the esoteric practices of\ntantra. Tantra is an important part of the path to liberation in the\nGeluk tradition. It is a path to liberation that is held to involve\ndistinct, esoteric methods, but without diverging from the\nphilosophical view of emptiness, which is indispensable. For this\nreason, Geluk philosophy is located squarely within the immanent world\nand the exoteric domain of discourse: the intersubjective spaces of\ndialogue and debate.\n\nTherefore, rather than overcoming mistaken concepts by circumventing\nthem in a mystical flash of insight or an ecstatic experience of\nunion, the Geluk tradition offers a more sober way to overcome\nmisconceptions, one based on clear, rational analysis and a direct\nappeal to this world. That is, this tradition holds reasoned analysis\nto be necessary to understand the nature of phenomena (or rather,\ntheir lack of nature). This is because an ascertainment of\nthe lack of true existence is held to be necessary to counteract the\ndirectly opposed notion\u2014the apprehension of true\nexistence\u2014which is the misinterpretation of reality (as more\nthan simply conventionally existing) that binds one to suffering. To\ndo this, it is not sufficient to simply \u201clet be,\u201d stare\ninto space, or ignore the cause of misinterpretation in some tranquil\n\u201cnonconceptual\u201d meditation; rather, one must have insight\ninduced by reason that counteracts the habit of holding onto true\nexistence.\n\nThus, in Geluk philosophy, we can say that insight into reality is not\nheld to be beyond thought, or attributed to some third category beyond\nthe world that is neither existent nor nonexistent, but is simply\ninsight into a world that is neither (ultimately) existent nor\n(conventionally) nonexistent. Even though Geluk scholars consent to\nthe fact that emptiness can be perceived nonconceptually\u2014in the\nrarified case of a highly developed meditation\u2014they maintain\nthat the emptiness that is known nonconceptually is no different from\nthe emptiness that is conceptually known. The sharp distinction\nbetween conceptual and perceptual arguably falls away when there is\nnothing beyond conceptual designation. It is not a surprise then that\nit is the conceptual ascertainment of emptiness that is a\nprincipal element of the Geluk school\u2019s philosophy. Moreover,\ntheir emphasis on the practice of insight is not based on an appeal to\na direct, unmediated access to what is beyond concepts, but to reason.\nReason is also given priority over scriptural authority, which is\nsubjected to the scrutiny of analysis and is adjudicated by reason\n(Tsongkhapa in Hopkins 1999, 71).\n",
