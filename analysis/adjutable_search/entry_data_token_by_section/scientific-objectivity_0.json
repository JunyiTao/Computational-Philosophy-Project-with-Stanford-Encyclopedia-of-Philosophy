    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nObjectivity is a value. To call a thing objective implies that it has\na certain importance to us and that we approve of it. Objectivity\ncomes in degrees. Claims, methods, results, and scientists can be more\nor less objective, and, other things being equal, the more objective,\nthe better. Using the term \u201cobjective\u201d to describe\nsomething often carries a special rhetorical force with it. The\nadmiration of science among the general public and the authority\nscience enjoys in public life stems to a large extent from the view\nthat science is objective or at least more objective than other modes\nof inquiry. Understanding scientific objectivity is therefore central\nto understanding the nature of science and the role it plays in\nsociety.\n\nIf what is so great about science is its objectivity, then objectivity\nshould be worth defending. The close examinations of scientific\npractice that philosophers of science have undertaken in the past\nfifty years have shown, however, that several conceptions of the ideal\nof objectivity are either questionable or unattainable. The prospects\nfor a science providing a non-perspectival \u201cview from\nnowhere\u201d or for proceeding in a way uninformed by human goals\nand values are fairly slim, for example.\n\nThis article discusses several proposals to characterize the idea and\nideal of objectivity in such a way that it is both strong enough to be\nvaluable, and weak enough to be attainable and workable in practice.\nWe begin with a natural conception of objectivity:\nfaithfulness to facts. We motivate the intuitive\nappeal of this conception, discuss its relation to scientific method\nand discuss arguments challenging both its attainability as well as\nits desirability. We then move on to a second conception of\nobjectivity as absence of normative commitments and\nvalue-freedom, and once more we contrast arguments in favor\nof such a conception with the challenges it faces. A third conception\nof objectivity which we discuss at length is the idea of\nabsence of personal bias.\n\nFinally there is the idea that objectivity is anchored in\nscientific communities and their practices. After\ndiscussing three case studies from economics, social\nscience and medicine, we address the conceptual unity of\nscientific objectivity: Do the various conceptions have a\ncommon valid core, such as promoting trust in science or minimizing\nrelevant epistemic risks? Or are they rivaling and only loosely\nrelated accounts? Finally we present some conjectures about what\naspects of objectivity remain defensible and desirable in the light of\nthe difficulties we have encountered.\n",
