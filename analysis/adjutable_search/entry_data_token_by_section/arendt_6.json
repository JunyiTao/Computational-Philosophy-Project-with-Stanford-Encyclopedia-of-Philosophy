However, while\nengaging in speech and action individuals can never be sure what kind\nof self they will reveal. Only retrospectively, that is, only through\nthe stories that will arise from their deeds and performances, will\ntheir identity become fully manifest. The function of the storyteller\nis thus crucial not only for the preservation of the doings and\nsayings of actors, but also for the full disclosure of the identity of\nthe actor. The narratives of a storyteller, Arendt claims, \u201ctell\nus more about their subjects, the \u2018hero\u2019 in the center of\neach story, than any product of human hands ever tells us about the\nmaster who produced it\u201d (HC, 184). Without a Plato to tell us\nwho Socrates was, what his conversations with fellow Athenian citizens\nwere like, without a Thucydides to set down Pericles\u2019 Funeral\nSpeech and refashion it in his powerful and dramatic style, we would\nnot have known what made Socrates and Pericles such outstanding\npersonalities, nor would the reason for their uniqueness have been\nmade fully manifest. Indeed, it is one of Arendt\u2019s most important\nclaims that the meaning of action itself is dependent upon the\narticulation retrospectively given to it by historians and\nnarrators.\n\n\nStorytelling, or the weaving of a narrative out of the actions and\npronouncements of individuals, is partly constitutive of their\nmeaning, because it enables the retrospective articulation of their\nsignificance and import, both for the actors themselves and for the\nspectators.  Being absorbed by their immediate aims and concerns, not\naware of the full implications of their actions, actors are often not\nin a position to assess the true significance of their doings, or to\nbe fully aware of their own motives and intentions. Only when action\nhas run a certain course, and its relationship to other actions has\nunfolded, can its significance be made fully manifest and be embodied\nin a narrative, whether of poets or historians. The fact that this\nnarrative is temporally deferred, that it is at some distance from the\nevents it describes, is one of the reasons why it can provide further\ninsight into the motives and aims of the actors.\n\n\nNarratives can thus provide a measure of truthfulness and a greater\ndegree of significance to the actions of individuals. But they also\npreserve the memory of deeds through time, and in so doing, they\nenable these deeds to become sources of inspiration for the future,\nthat is, models to be imitated, and, if possible, surpassed. One of\nthe principal drawbacks of action, Arendt maintains, is to be\nextremely fragile, to be subject to the erosion of time and to\nforgetfulness; unlike the products of the activity of work, which\nacquire a measure of permanence by virtue of their sheer facticity,\ndeeds and words do not survive their enactment unless they are\nremembered. Remembrance alone, the retelling of deeds as\nstories, can save the lives and deeds of actors from oblivion and\nfutility. And it is precisely for this reason, Arendt points out, that\nthe Greeks valued poetry and history so highly, because they rescued\nthe glorious (as well as the less glorious) deeds of the past for the\nbenefit of future generations (HC, 192 ff; BPF, 63\u201375). It was\nthe poet\u2019s and the historian\u2019s political function to preserve the\nmemory of past actions and to make them a source of instruction for\nthe future. Homer was known as the \u201ceducator of Hellas,\u201d\nsince he immortalized for all those who came after him the events of\nthe Trojan War; Thucydides, in his History of the Peloponnesian\nWar, told a story of human ambition and folly, of courage and\nunchecked greed, of ruthless struggle and inevitable defeat. In their\nwork the past became a repository of instruction, of actions to be\nemulated as well as deeds to be shunned. Through their narratives the\nfragility and perishability of human action was overcome and made to\noutlast the lives of their doers and the limited life-span of their\ncontemporaries.\n\n\nHowever, to be preserved, such narratives needed in turn an audience,\nthat is, a community of hearers who became the transmitters of the\ndeeds that had been immortalized. As Sheldon Wolin has aptly put it,\n\u201caudience is a metaphor for the political community whose nature\nis to be a community of remembrance\u201d (Wolin 1977, 97). In other\nwords, behind the actor stands the storyteller, but behind the\nstoryteller stands a community of memory.\n\n\nIt was one of the primary functions of the polis to be\nprecisely such a community, to preserve the words and deeds of its\ncitizens from oblivion and the ravages of time, and thereby to leave a\ntestament for future generations. The Greek polis, beyond\nmaking possible the sharing of words and deeds and multiplying the\noccasions to win immortal fame, was meant to remedy the frailty of\nhuman affairs. It did this by establishing a framework where action\nand speech could be recorded and transformed into stories, where every\ncitizen could be a witness and thereby a potential narrator. What the\npolis established, then, was a space where organized\nremembrance could take place, and where, as a result, the\nmortality of actors and the fragility of human deeds could be\npartially overcome.\n",
