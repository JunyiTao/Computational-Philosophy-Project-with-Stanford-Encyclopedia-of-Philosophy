While Wang Chong was a somewhat\nmarginal figure in his time (a situation about which he complains in\nhis work), his thought became influential indirectly in later years,\nparticularly in the leadup to the Xuanxue movement in the\nWei-Jin period. Wang\u2019s writing was not only voluminous, but\ncontained a wealth of historical references, quotes, and citations of\nearlier thinkers. Wang apparently studied a wide range of texts, and\nwrote about many of them. Thus, his work survived mainly due to being\ncollected and used as a kind of encyclopedia by figures in the late\nHan and Wei-Jin periods. A number of these figures became prominent in\nthe \u201cQingtan\u201d (pure talk) discussion movement\nthat preceded Xuanxue, and Wang\u2019s ideas influenced the\nmovement via this direction (see McLeod 2020).\n\nWang\u2019s most original contributions were his views on methodology\nand criticism, truth and knowledge, and human nature and agency. A\nnumber of scholars have written in recent years on Wang\u2019s views\non these topics (including Klein & Klein 2016; McLeod 2018; and\nSong 2020).\n\nWang developed a critical method he referred to as wen nan\n\u554f\u96e3 (\u201cquestioning and challenging\u201d), built of\ntwo parts (Lunheng 28). According to Wang, to discern the\ntruth in the texts of the sages of the past, we begin with an\ninvestigation of their words, subjecting them to questioning so as to\nclarify them. The statements or teachings (yan \u8a00)\nfound in texts that are unclear or interpretively ambiguous, Wang\nclaims, should be subjected to clarifying questioning. This\nquestioning aims to remove any lack of clarity and derive a position\nthat can be evaluated on its merits. Once we have clear and evaluable\nstatements, we can then apply the method of \u201cchallenging\u201d,\nwhich more directly evaluates statements by presenting them with\ncounterexamples, looking for cases in which they do not hold, testing\ntheir plausibility, considering their practicability, etc. Wang offers\na general statement of the need for this method in his chapter\n\u201cQuestioning Confucius\u201d, in which he criticizes his\ncontemporaries for their unwillingness to challenge the words of sages\nof the past:\n\n\nWhen the worthies and sages wrote their works, they used their\nthoughts to make a detailed investigation of things. We cannot say\nthat they completely attained the truth (about everything) even then.\nGiven this, how could it possibly be that their everyday and idle\nstatements are completely true? These statements cannot all be true,\nbut the people of today don\u2019t know how to challenge them. Or if\nsome of these statements are true and the ideas imparted are unclear\nand hard to make out, the people of today do not know how to question\nthem. (Lunheng 28.1, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nAccording to Wang, this inability is in part explained by the\nunwillingness of scholars to innovate and to break with the sages. In\nthe chapter Duizuo (Replies on Creation), Wang confronts the\ncommonly held view, expressed in the Analects of Confucius,\nthat it is best to transmit the teachings of the ancient sages rather\nthan to create or innovate. \u201cCreation\u201d (zuo\n\u4f5c) as such was looked at in a negative way in the Han, despite\na wealth of innovation in this period. Using his proposed method, Wang\naimed to distinguish true (shi \u5be6) statements from\nfalse (xu \u865b) statements. Wang understood false\nstatements as ones that tend to have a grip on us for a variety of\nreasons. Wang was not concerned with falsehoods that we have no\ninclination to believe, but rather with ones that have an intrinsic\nattractiveness. He argued that \u201cflowery\u201d (hua\n\u82b1) words have this feature, attracting us due to their style,\nrather than their veridicality. A whole host of human biases\ncontributes to making certain kinds of falsehoods attractive to us. In\naddition to having a preference for flowery words, we are also\ninclined toward those statements and teachings that present us in a\ngood light, feeding our sense of superiority, our vanity, or advancing\nour personal interests. It is this category of statement for which\nWang reserves the category of \u201cfalse\u201d (xu), using\na term that also has the sense of \u201cempty\u201d. Xu\nstatements are attractive statements that lack the important features\nthat make statements true. What makes a statement true (shi)\nis that it has the features we generally seek in evaluating\nstatements, rather than only in particular cases with certain options\nattractive to us. These features will be different depending on the\nkind of statement we are evaluating. A true moral statement will have\ndifferent truth-making features than a statement of medicine or\ngeology.\n\nAnother important issue dealt with in Wang\u2019s work is that of\nhuman nature or inborn characteristics (xing \u6027), which\nis intertwined with a number of concepts, including agency and\nallotment (ming \u547d). Wang develops an account of human\nagency that is remarkably innovative for his time, drawing a contrast\nbetween agency and \u201cspontaneity\u201d or self-action\n(ziran \u81ea\u7136). Wang is concerned with the ways in\nwhich the kind of moral cultivation discussed in earlier texts such as\nthose of the Confucians can make a difference in human behaviors and\nin the outcomes resulting from these behaviors. Can we, through the\nkinds of practices the Confucians enjoin, rectify and change our\nbehavior so as to produce different effects than those that otherwise\nwould have resulted? To accept that human activity can make such a\ndifference in the world seems to conflict with another idea of\nantiquity, that all of us are bound by our allotment (ming),\nwhich is governed by the world. Wang attempts to square these two\nconflicting ideas in numerous chapters of the Lunheng.\n\nAccording to Wang, human inborn characteristics (xing) are\ndetermined by the allotment (ming) provided to humans by\nnature. This process is one absent of agency of any kind, and happens\n\u201cspontaneously\u201d (ziran). Wang uses the image of\ngeneration in nature to describe such spontaneous or non-agentive\nactivity. The act of human procreation, for example, displays both\nagentive and non-agentive features. While individuals decide to engage\nin the procreative act, the generation of the embryo that becomes a\nchild happens spontaneously (ziran), without effort and\nintention. Wang seems to go even further than this toward determinism,\nhowever. He writes that even human behavior is ultimately determined\nby non-agentive features of the world, even bypassing the inborn\ncharacteristics generally taken to explain our behavior, and itself\ndetermined by non-agentive features of the world. Wang writes, in the\nZhiqi (Periods of Government) chapter of\nLunheng:\n\n\nWhen grain is sufficient and there is enough to eat, adherence to\nritual and righteousness are born in the heart. When ritual flourishes\nand righteousness is abundant, the foundations of peace are\nestablished. Therefore in the spring of a year of famine, one does not\neven feed one\u2019s relatives, whereas in the autumn of a year of\nabundance, one calls together one\u2019s neighbors from the four\ndirections to feast. Not to feed relatives is evil conduct, while to\ncall together neighbors from the four directions is good, righteous\nconduct. The formation of good or bad conduct is not a matter of the\nsubstantive character of the person (zhi xing\n\u8cea\u6027), but is rather a matter of the collection of grains.\n(Lunheng 53.6, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nWhile attributing human behavior to such non-agentive external\ncircumstances, Wang also makes room for inborn characteristics\n(xing). These characteristics, which differ by individual on\nthe basis of that individual\u2019s allotment (ming) from\nnature, determine the moral quality of a person\u2019s actions. Wang\nwrites:\n\n\n\u2026in the natural characteristics of persons there is good and\nbad, just like concerning the talents of persons there is high and\nlow\u2026..Natural characteristics and the receipt of one\u2019s\nallotment (ming) are one in the same. Allotment determines\nwhether one is wealthy or impoverished, natural characteristics\nwhether one is virtuous or vicious. (Lunheng 13.19,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n\nIn linking inborn characteristics concerning the moral quality of\nbehavior to naturally allotted features such as certain kinds of\ntalent, Wang attempts to explain the origins of character in terms of\nultimately spontaneous, non-agentive aspects of the world. Despite a\nseemingly deterministic view of human activity, however, Wang attempts\nto make room for agency and the efficacy of human activity in altering\npatterns. Wang argues that moral education can play a role in\ntransforming human behavior, through transforming one\u2019s\ncharacter, and this involves concerted effort (agentive effort) on the\npart of the individual (Lunheng 5). Wang recognizes that on\nthe face this view seems to conflict with his statements of\ndeterminism elsewhere. To attempt to solve this problem, he relies on\na distinction between three types of allotment (ming). In\nsome earlier texts, ming is understood in a more clearly\ndeterministic way, which is why we commonly see the term translated as\n\u201cdestiny\u201d or \u201cfate\u201d. Wang abandons this strict\ndeterminism here. Human agency can play a role in certain types of\nallotment and not others. Wang writes:\n\n\nTradition says that there are three types of allotment: natural\nallotment, consequent allotment, and incidental allotment. Natural\nallotment is said to be when good outcome issues from the original\nconstitution of itself. Based on natural characteristics in themselves\nthe bones are healthy, therefore one does not have to move away from\nand transform one\u2019s conduct to seek good fortune, but a good\noutcome is achieved from one\u2019s own characteristics. This is why\nit is called natural allotment. Those with consequent allotment exert\neffort to control their conduct and through this achieve good fortune\nand outcome. If they were to allow free rein to their emotions and\ndesires they would come upon misfortune. This is why it is called\nconsequent allotment. As far as those with incidental allotment, their\nconduct is good but they obtain evil, and they are without any hope\nfor help. Meeting with incident externally, they obtain misfortune.\nThis is why it is called incidental allotment. (Lunheng 6.4,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n\nThe role of agency is emphasized in the second of these three types of\nallotment, consequent allotment (sui ming \u96a8\u547d.\nWe begin with a natural allotment (zheng ming\n\u6b63\u547d) such that particular features of our lives are\ndetermined. This allotment can be altered either by human effort\n(which gives us consequent allotment) or meeting with accidents in the\nworld\u2014incidental allotment (zao ming \u906d\u547d).\nWhile human agency can alter our allotment and thus the outcomes of\nour lives and behaviors, the scope and effect of this activity is\nstill limited by our natural allotment. Indeed, Wang argues that this\nexternal limitation is key to understanding the value and effect of\nmoral instruction and cultivation. This is the case for both\nindividual moral self-cultivation and for the moral instruction of the\npeople by the state and the ruler. Wang writes, in his discussion on\ngovernment in the chapter Zhiqi (Periods of Government):\n\n\nA good doctor is able to use needles and medicines and is successful\nin his arts when he meets with a person who has not yet died who has\nan illness that does not lead to death. If the person\u2019s illness\nis terminal, the doctor can do nothing, even if he is a master. The\nallotment connected to a serious illness is such that it cannot be\ncured, just as disorder among the people cannot be undone. Medicine\ncures illness just as instruction guides and pacifies the people. They\nare both a matter of allotment (ming) and the times, and\ncannot be attained by ordering or using force. (Lunheng 53.3,\nauthor\u2019s translation).\n\n",
