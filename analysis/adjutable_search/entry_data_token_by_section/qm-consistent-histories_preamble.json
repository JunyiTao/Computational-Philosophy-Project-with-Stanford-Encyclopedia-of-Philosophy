    "main_text": "\nThe consistent histories, also known as decoherent histories,\napproach to quantum interpretation is broadly compatible with standard\nquantum mechanics as found in textbooks. However, the concept\nof measurement by which probabilities are introduced in\nstandard quantum theory no longer plays a fundamental\nrole. Instead, all quantum time dependence is probabilistic\n(stochastic), with probabilities given by the Born rule or its\nextensions. By requiring that the description of a quantum system be\ncarried out using a well-defined probabilistic sample space (called a\n\u201cframework\u201d) this approach resolves all the well-known\nquantum paradoxes of quantum foundations. In particular, quantum\nmechanics is local and consistent with special relativity. Classical\nmechanics emerges as a useful approximation to the more fundamental\nquantum mechanics under suitable conditions. The price to be paid for\nthis is a set of rules for reasoning resembling, but also\nsignificantly different from, those which comprise quantum logic. An\nimportant philosophical implication is the lack of a single\nuniversally-true state of affairs at each instant of time. However,\nthere is a correspondence limit in which the new quantum logic becomes\nstandard logic in the macroscopic world of everyday experience.\nIn the article that follows the term \u2018consistent\nhistories\u2019 will generally be abbreviated to\n\u2018histories\u2019, since the \u2018decoherent\u2019 and\n\u2018consistent\u2019 interpretations are very similar; when in\ndoubt insert \u2018consistent\u2019 before\n\u2018histories\u2019. The reader is assumed familiar with, and\nprobably a bit confused by and frustrated with, the fundamentals of\nquantum mechanics found in introductory textbooks.\n",
