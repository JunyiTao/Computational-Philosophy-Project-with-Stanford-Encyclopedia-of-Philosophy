    "main_text": "The Legacy from Antiquity || The Void\n2.1 The Void\n\n The most important question shaping 17th-century views on the nature\nof space, time and motion is whether or not a true void or vacuum is\npossible, i.e., a place devoid of body of any sort (including rarified\nsubstances such as air). Ancient atomism, dating back at least to the\npre-Socratic philosopher Democritus (5th century, B. C.), held that\nnot only is such possible, but in fact actually exists among the\ninterstices of the smallest, indivisible parts of matter and extends\nwithout bound infinitely. Following Plato, Aristotle rejected the\npossibility of a void, claiming that, by definition, a void is\nnothing, and what is nothing cannot exist.  \n",
