Phenomenology in Contemporary Consciousness Theory\n\n\nPhenomenological issues, by any other name, have played a prominent\nrole in very recent philosophy of mind. Amplifying the theme of the\nprevious section, we note two such issues: the form of inner awareness\nthat ostensibly makes a mental activity conscious, and the phenomenal\ncharacter of conscious cognitive mental activity in thought, and\nperception, and action.\n\n\nEver since Nagel\u2019s 1974 article, \u201cWhat Is It Like to be a Bat?\u201d, the\nnotion of what-it-is-like to experience a mental state or activity has\nposed a challenge to reductive materialism and functionalism in theory\nof mind. This subjective phenomenal character of consciousness is held\nto be constitutive or definitive of consciousness. What is the form of\nthat phenomenal character we find in consciousness?\n\n\nA prominent line of analysis holds that the phenomenal character of\na mental activity consists in a certain form of awareness of that\nactivity, an awareness that by definition renders it conscious. Since\nthe 1980s a variety of models of that awareness have been developed. As\nnoted above, there are models that define this awareness as a\nhigher-order monitoring, either an inner perception of the activity (a\nform of inner sense per Kant) or inner consciousness (per Brentano), or\nan inner thought about the activity. A further model analyzes such\nawareness as an integral part of the experience, a form of\nself-representation within the experience. (Again, see Kriegel and\nWilliford (eds.) (2006).)\n\n\nA somewhat different model comes arguably closer to the form of\nself-consciousness sought by Brentano, Husserl, and Sartre. On the\n\u201cmodal\u201d model, inner awareness of an experience takes the form of an\nintegral reflexive awareness of \u201cthis very experience\u201d. That form of\nawareness is held to be a constitutive element of the experience that\nrenders it conscious. As Sartre put the claim, self-consciousness is\nconstitutive of consciousness, but that self-consciousness is\n\u201cpre-reflective\u201d. This reflexive awareness is not, then, part of a\nseparable higher-order monitoring, but rather built into consciousness\nper se. On the modal model, this awareness is part of the way the\nexperience unfolds: subjectively, phenomenally, consciously. This model\nis elaborated in D. W. Smith (2004), Mind World, in the essay \u201cReturn\nto Consciousness\u201d (and elsewhere).\n\n\nWhatever may be the precise form of phenomenal character, we would\nask how that character distributes over mental life. What is phenomenal\nin different types of mental activity? Here arise issues of cognitive\nphenomenology. Is phenomenality restricted to the \u201cfeel\u201d of sensory\nexperience? Or is phenomenality present also in cognitive experiences of\nthinking such-and-such, or of perception bearing conceptual as well as\nsensory content, or also in volitional or conative bodily action? These\nissues are explored in Bayne and Montague (eds.) (2011), Cognitive\nPhenomenology.\n\n\nA restrictive view holds that only sensory experience has a proper\nphenomenal character, a what-it-is-like. Seeing a color, hearing a\ntone, smelling an odor, feeling a pain\u2014these types of\nconscious experience have a phenomenal character, but no others do, on\nthis view.  A stringent empiricism might limit phenomenal experience\nto pure sensations, though Hume himself presumably recognized\nphenomenal \u201cideas\u201d beyond pure sense\n\u201cimpressions\u201d. A somewhat more expansive view would hold\nthat perceptual experience has a distinctive phenomenal character even\nwhere sensation is informed by concepts. Seeing that yellow canary,\nhearing that clear Middle C on a Steinway piano, smelling the sharp\nodor of anise, feeling a pain of the jab of the doctor\u2019s needle in\nreceiving an injection\u2014these types of conscious experience\nhave a character of what-it-is-like, a character informed by\nconceptual content that is also \u201cfelt\u201d, on this view. A\nKantian account of conceptual-sensory experience, or\n\u201cintuition\u201d, would endorse a phenomenal character in these\ntypes of experience. Indeed, \u201cphenomena\u201d, in the Kantian\nidiom, are precisely things as they appear in consciousness, so of\ncourse their appearance has a phenomenal character.\n\n\nNow, a much more expansive view would hold that every conscious\nexperience has a distinctive phenomenal character. Thinking that 17 is\na prime number, thinking that the red in the sunset is caused by the\nsun\u2019s light waves being bent by the atmosphere, thinking that Kant was\nmore right than Hume about the grounds of knowledge, thinking that\neconomic principles are also political\u2014even such highly\ncognitive activities have a character of what-it-is-like to so think,\naccording to this expansive view.\n\n\nClassical phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty surely\nassumed an expansive view of phenomenal consciousness. As noted above,\nthe \u201cphenomena\u201d that are the focus of phenomenology were\nassumed to present a rich character of lived experience. Even\nHeidegger, while de-emphasizing consciousness (the Cartesian sin!),\ndwelt on \u201cphenomena\u201d as what appears or shows up to us (to\n\u201cDasein\u201d) in our everyday activities such as hammering a\nnail. Like Merleau-Ponty, Gurwitsch (1964) explicitly studies the\n\u201cphenomenal field\u201d, embracing all that is presented in our\nexperience. Arguably, for these thinkers, every type of conscious\nexperience has its distinctive phenomenal character, its\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d\u2014and the task of phenomenology (the\ndiscipline) is to analyze that character. Note that in recent debates\nthe phenomenal character of an experience is often called its\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d\u2014whereas, in the established idiom,\nthe term \u201cphenomenology\u201d names the discipline that studies\nsuch \u201cphenomenology\u201d.\n\n\nSince intentionality is a crucial property of consciousness,\naccording to Brentano, Husserl, et al., the character of intentionality\nitself would count as phenomenal, as part of what-it-is-like to\nexperience a given type of intentional experience. But it is not only\nintentional perception and thought that have their distinctive\nphenomenal characters. Embodied action also would have a distinctive\nphenomenal character, involving \u201clived\u201d characters of kinesthetic\nsensation as well as conceptual volitional content, say, in the feel of\nkicking a soccer ball. The \u201clived body\u201d is precisely the body as\nexperienced in everyday embodied volitional action such as running or\nkicking a ball or even speaking. Husserl wrote at length about the\n\u201clived body\u201d (Leib), in Ideas II, and Merleau-Ponty followed suit with\nrich analyses of embodied perception and action, in Phenomenology of\nPerception. In Bayne and Montague (eds.) (2011) see the article on\nconative phenomenology by Terence Horgan, and in Smith and Thomasson\n(eds.) (2005) see articles by Charles Siewert and Sean Kelly.\n\n\nBut now a problems remains. Intentionality essentially involves\nmeaning, so the question arises how meaning appears in phenomenal\ncharacter. Importantly, the content of a conscious experience typically\ncarries a horizon of background meaning, meaning that is largely\nimplicit rather than explicit in experience. But then a wide range of\ncontent carried by an experience would not have a consciously felt\nphenomenal character. So it may well be argued. Here is a line of\nphenomenological theory for another day.\n",
