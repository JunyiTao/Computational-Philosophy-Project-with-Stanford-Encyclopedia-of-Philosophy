    "main_text": "Propositions and Traditional Grammar\n2. Propositions and Traditional Grammar\n\nConsider the proposition that Vega is a star, which can figure in\ninferences like (8).\n\n(8)\nEvery star is purple, and Vega is a star; so Vega\nis purple.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s logic focused on quantificational propositions; and\nas we shall see, this was prescient. But on his view, propositions\nlike the conclusion of (8) still exemplify a subject-predicate\nstructure that is shared by at least many of the sentences we used to\nexpress propositions. And one can easily formulate the schema\n\u2018every S is P, and n is S;\nso n is P\u2019, where the new lower-case variable\nis intended to range over proposition-parts of the sort indicated by\nnames. (On some views, discussed below, a name like \u2018Vega\u2019\nis a complex quantificational expression; though unsurprisingly, such\nviews are tendentious.)\n\nTypically, a declarative sentence can be divided into a subject and a\npredicate: \u2018Every star / is purple\u2019, \u2018Vega / is a\nstar\u2019, \u2018Some politician / lied\u2019, \u2018The\nbrightest planet / is visible tonight\u2019, etc. Until quite\nrecently, it was widely held that this grammatical division reflects a\ncorresponding kind of logical structure: the subject of a proposition\n(i.e., what the proposition is about) is a target for predication. On\nthis view, both \u2018Every star\u2019 and \u2018Vega\u2019\nindicate subjects of propositions in (8), while \u2018is\u2019\nintroduces predicates. Aristotle would have said that in the premises\nof (8), being purple is predicated of every star, and being a star is\npredicated of Vega. Later theorists emphasized the contrast between\ngeneral terms like \u2018star\u2019 and singular terms like\n\u2018Vega\u2019, while also distinguishing terms from\nsyncategorematic expressions (e.g., \u2018every\u2019 and\n\u2018is\u2019) that can combine with terms to form complex subjects\nand predicates, including \u2018will lie\u2019, \u2018can\nlie\u2019, and \u2018may have lied\u2019. But despite the\ncomplications, it seemed clear that many propositions have the\nfollowing canonical form: Subject-copula-Predicate; where a copula\nlinks a subject, which may consist of a quantifier and a general term,\nto a general term. Sentences like \u2018Every star twinkles\u2019\ncan be paraphrased with sentences like \u2018Every star is a\ntwinkling thing\u2019. This invites the suggestion that\n\u2018twinkles\u2019 is somehow an abbreviation for \u2018is a\ntwinkling thing\u2019.\n\nThe proposition that not only Vega twinkles, which seems to contain\nthe proposition that Vega twinkles, presumably includes elements that\nare indicated with \u2018only\u2019 and \u2018not\u2019. Such\nexamples invite the hypothesis that all propositions are composed of\nterms along with a relatively small number of syncategorematic\nelements, and that complex propositions can be reduced to canonical\npropositions that are governed by Aristotelian logic. This is not to\nsay that all propositions were, or could be, successfully analyzed in\nthis manner. But via this strategy, medieval logicians were able to\ndescribe many impeccable infereces as instances of valid forms. And\nthis informed their discussions of how logic is related to\ngrammar.\n\nMany viewed their project as an attempt to uncover principles of a\nmental language common to all thinkers. Aristotle had said, similarly,\nthat spoken sounds symbolize \u201caffections of the soul.\u201d\nFrom this perspective, one expects to find some differences between\npropositions and overt sentences. If \u2018Every star twinkles\u2019\nexpresses a proposition that contains a copula, then spoken languages\nmask certain aspects of logical structure.\n William of Ockham\n held that a mental language would have no need for Latin\u2019s\ndeclensions, and that logicians could ignore such aspects of spoken\nlanguage. The ancient Greeks were aware of sophisms like the\nfollowing: that dog is a father, and that dog is yours; so that dog is\nyour father. This bad inference cannot share its form with the\nsuperficially parallel but impeccable variant: that dog is a mutt, and\nthat mutt is yours; so that dog is your mutt. (See Plato, Euthydemus\n298 d-e.) So the superficial features of sentences are not infallible\nguides to the logical forms of propositions. Still, the divergence was\nheld to be relatively minor. Spoken sentences have structure; they are\ncomposed, in systematic ways, of words. And the assumption was that\nspoken sentences reflect the major aspects of propositional form,\nincluding a subject-predicate division. So while there is a\ndistinction between the study of valid inference and the study of\nsentences used in spoken language, the connection between logic and\ngrammar was thought to run deep. This suggested that the logical form\nof a proposition just is the grammatical form of some (perhaps mental)\nsentence.\n",
