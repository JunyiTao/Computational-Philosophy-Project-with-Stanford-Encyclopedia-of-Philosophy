    "main_text": "Theoretical Philosophy || Philosophy of Mind\n2.3 Philosophy of Mind\n2.3.1 Soul and body\n\nWith the rediscovery of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysical and ethical\nworks, thirteenth-century theologians devoted an increasing portion of\ntheir time to interpreting and developing Aristotelian accounts of\nhuman nature. Olivi was very far from a slavish admirer of\nAristotle\u2019s, and his theory of the nature of the soul and its\nrelation to the body differs radically from those medieval\ninterpretations which endeavor to be faithful to the Philosopher.\nNonetheless, he employs the Aristotelian theoretical framework, and\nalthough he often seems to be rather hostile to Aristotle\u2019s\npervasive influence, once remarking that \u201cwithout reason he is\nbelieved, as the god of this age\u201d (Summa II q. 58 ad 14,\np. 482; see Burr 1971), the main thrust of his criticism is directed\nat contemporary Averroist interpretations of Aristotle rather than at\nAristotle himself (Piron 2006b). The critical, even harsh passages\nmust be understood in this light.\n\nNonetheless, he rejects many principles that are crucial for\nAristotle\u2019s account of the soul-body relationship. He argues\nthat it is \u201cnot only contrary to reason but also dangerous to\nthe faith\u201d to hold that \u201cthe [soul\u2019s] intellective\nand free part is the form of the body per se and considered as\nsuch\u201d (Summa II q. 51, p. 104). Others had questioned the\nextent to which soul and body could be analyzed in terms of form and\nmatter, but Olivi goes further because he explicitly denies that one\npart of the soul, the rational part, can be understood as the form of\nthe body. This denial is ultimately based on his view that the\nintellectual part of the soul must be spiritual and incorporeal\nbecause otherwise it cannot be immortal, intellectual, and free. Yet\nhe does not want to jeopardize the substantial unity of the soul and\nthe body, and he works towards a theory which incorporates both of\nthese doctrines.\n\nOlivi\u2019s denial that the soul\u2019s intellectual part is the\nform of the body matches fairly closely with a doctrine that was\ncondemned by the Council of Vienne in 1312, when Pope Clement V\ndeclared in the bull Fidei catholicae fundamento that it is a\nheresy to hold that \u201cthe rational or intellective soul is not\nper se and essentially the form of the human body\u201d (Denzinger\n1965, n. 902). However, it is easy to misunderstand what Olivi is\nsaying, and a closer analysis shows that his position is far more\nnuanced than the wording of the condemnation suggests. First, he is\nnot denying that the rational part of the soul is a form, or even that\nit is the form of a human being. To begin with, he follows Bonaventure\nand makes the distinction discussed above between two kinds of matter.\nThe human body and all material objects are made of corporeal matter,\nbut spiritual entities (angels and human souls) also have a material\nsubstratum, the so-called spiritual matter. Olivi argues that the\nrational part of the soul, intellect and will, is a form of this\nspiritual matter. It is acceptable to speak of intellect as the form\nof a human being since the spiritual matter belongs to the\nhuman being. But because the spiritual matter of the soul is distinct\nfrom the corporeal matter of the body, Olivi can maintain that the\nrational part is not the form of the body (see e.g. Summa\nII q. 51 appendix, p. 138).\n\nSecond, Olivi is not denying that the soul is the form of the\nbody. What he denies is that the rational part of the soul\n(\u201cthe intellective and free part\u201d) is the form of the\nbody. He resorts to a doctrine of the plurality of substantial forms,\naccording to which complex substances, such as human beings, have\nseveral more or less distinct forms that together make the complete\nhuman being. The intellectual part of the soul is distinct from\nanother part, the sensory part, and only the latter is the form of the\nbody. Because the two parts of the soul are united in the spiritual\nmatter, it is acceptable to say that the whole soul is the form of the\nbody:\n\n\nIt is said that the whole rational soul, rather than the sensory part,\nis the form of the body, even though it is informed by the whole only\ninsofar as it is informed by the soul\u2019s sensory and nutritive\npart. (Summa II q. 51 app., p. 146)\n\n\nWe should say that the whole soul is the form of the body, in much the\nsame way that we say that a person talks, not a tongue (ibid., p.\n144). But if we direct our attention to the various parts of the soul,\nthen it is wrong to say that the rational part, \u201cper se and\nconsidered as such,\u201d is the form of the body. The soul is the\nform of the body only with respect to its sensory and nutritive part.\nGiven Olivi\u2019s argumentation against the formal union between the\nintellectual part of the soul and the body, it may seem that the unity\nof the human being is compromised. Olivi argues, however, that the\nrelation between these two parts is substantial even though it is\nmediated by the sensory part and the spiritual matter of the soul. He\nwrites:\n\n\nIf the human body is united and inclined to the sensory form, which is\ninclined and united to the intellectual form; and the intellectual\nform is essentially united to the sensory form, which is inclined to\nthe body; then by the same token the intellectual form and the body\nare necessarily substantially united to each other. Still, this does\nnot mean that they would be united as form and matter. (Summa\nII q. 51, p. 134)\n\n\nThe substantial union between the intellectual and sensory parts is\ndue to their being the forms of the same spiritual matter of the soul.\nIn this way, all the metaphysical components constitute a single\nsubstance. A human being is an essentially unified entity even though\nthe intellectual part of the soul is not the actuality of the body or\nany of its parts.\n2.3.2 Cognitive activity and attention\n\nOne of the most interesting and original aspects of Olivi\u2019s\nphilosophy is his critique of the standard Aristotelian model of\ncognition. The starting point of this critique is the Augustinian\nconception of the ontological superiority of the soul with respect to\nthe body, which leads Olivi to insist that perception and intellectual\nunderstanding cannot be passive reception of external stimuli but must\nbe understood as active processes. On the conventional medieval view,\na cognitive power simply receives impressions from the world, in the\nform of sensible or intelligible species. Olivi argues that such an\naccount leaves out a crucial element, the focusing of the cognitive\npower\u2019s attention on the object to be cognized:\n\n\nHowever much the cognitive power is informed through a disposition and\na species differing from the cognitive action, it cannot advance to a\ncognitive action unless before this it actually tends toward the\nobject, so that the attention of its intention should be actually\nturned and directed to the object. (Summa II q. 72, p. 9)\n\n\nOlivi gives the kinds of examples that one would expect. The ears of\nsomeone sleeping, for instance, receive the same impressions as the\nears of someone awake, but the sleeper does not sense these\nimpressions. Even when we are awake, we sometimes do not perceive\nobjects right in front of us when we are intently focused on something\nelse (Summa II q. 73, pp. 89\u201390).\n\nOlivi argues that this kind of cognitive attention requires a\n\u201cvirtual extension\u201d toward the object. Though he accepts\nthe traditional theory of species in medio, sensible qualities\nthat fill the air between the senses and their objects (for details,\nsee Demange and Kedar 2020), he denies that these species are the\nefficient cause of cognition. One striking consequence of this claim\nis that the object itself need not exert any causal influence, not on\nthe cognitive powers nor even on the physical sense organs. The\nexternal object need only be close enough to be apprehended by the\ncognizer\u2019s spiritual attention. In the cases of both perception\nand understanding, the efficient agent is the cognitive power. The\nexternal object is merely a kind of final cause or, more precisely, a\n\u201cterminative cause\u201d (Summa II q. 72, p. 36;\nEpistola, n. 12). It is merely by being the object of the\ncognitive power\u2019s attention that the external object plays a\nrole in cognition.\n\nOlivi treats virtual attention\u2014or directedness\u2014not as a\nsui generis activity of the mind, but as a general kind of causal\nrelationship that can be applied to physical agents just as much as to\nmental ones. For him, every natural physical agent has a virtual\nattention of this sort that extends as far as its causal force does\n(Summa II q. 23, pp. 424\u201325). One authority comments that\nOlivi\u2019s virtual attention is \u201cin fact equivalent to action\nat a distance\u201d (Jansen 1921, p. 118), a characterization that\nseems apt in the case of physical effects such as the light of the sun\nthat illuminates distant objects.\n\nHowever, the case of cognitive acts is different. Olivi carefully\navoids committing to real extramission of vision, and he argues that\nperceptual acts take place in the powers of the soul, not in the\nperceived object (Summa II q. 58, p. 482; Silva & Toivanen\n2010). The virtual extension of the soul\u2019s attention is not\nreal, not even in some special nonphysical sense. When Olivi explains\nthat the extension is \u2018virtual\u2019, he means to contrast it\nwith \u2018real\u2019. He explicitly denies, for instance, that this\nvirtual extension involves \u201cany real emission of its\nessence\u201d (Summa II q. 73, p. 61). Elsewhere, considering\nthe claim that \u201cour mind is where it fixes its intention,\u201d\nhe says that \u201cthese words are metaphorical, for we are not there\nreally or substantially, but only virtually or intentionally\u201d\n(Summa II q. 37 ad 13, p. 672). On this basis it is fair to say\nthat the soul does not actually perform any action at a distance,\nalthough its attention can be directed to distant objects.\nAccordingly, Olivi\u2019s view is best described as an intentional\ntheory of cognition (Perler 2002; Toivanen 2013a).\n\nOlivi allows that the object itself, through species in medio,\ncan indirectly act on our spiritual faculties, through what he calls\nthe via colligantiae (way of connection). A flash of lightning\nwill make a physical impression on our eyes, and this physical\nimpression can, through the via colligantiae, affect the\nspiritual sensory powers. But, crucially, this connection is not what\nbrings about sensation. We see this flash, as opposed to\nreceiving merely a physical impression from it, when we direct our\nspiritual attention toward it (Quodlibet I.4). This via\ncolligantiae plays an important role across Olivi\u2019s\nphilosophical psychology, being his general method of explaining the\nvexed connection between mind and body (see Summa II q. 59, pp.\n546\u201354; ibid. q. 72, pp. 30\u201335; Jansen 1921, pp.\n76\u201390).\n2.3.3 Words and concepts\n\nOlivi extends his critique of species to the mental word\n(verbum), which was standardly postulated as the product of\nintellectual thought. His treatment of the verbum raises\ndifferent issues from those associated with species. Here the issue is\nnot direct realism, precisely, but rather the nature of concept\nformation. Near the start of his commentary on the Gospel of John,\nOlivi describes the standard view as follows: \u201cOur mental word\nis something following an act of thought [\u2026] and formed by that\nthought. [\u2026] After it has been formed [\u2026] the\n[extra-mental] object is clearly understood or viewed in that word as\nif in a mirror\u201d (Tractatus de verbo 6.1). This word,\nmoreover, \u201cis that which is first cognized by intellect and is\nits first object;\u201d the extra-mental object is cognized\nsecondarily. This description closely matches a characterization Olivi\ngives in his later Sentences commentary:\n\n\nSome maintain that a kind of concept, or word, is formed through an\nabstractive, investigative, or inventive consideration, in which real\nobjects are intellectively cognized as in a mirror. For they call this\nthe first thing understood, and the immediate object; it is a kind of\nintention, concept, and defining notion of things. (Summa II q.\n74, pp. 120\u201321)\n\n\nThis view has two characteristic features. First, it postulates a\nmental representation\u2014a concept or word\u2014that is the\nproduct of intellectual activity. Second, it supposes that we\nunderstand the world through these representations, in such a way that\nwe get at the world indirectly, or secondarily, \u201cas if in a\nmirror.\u201d Call this an object theory of the verbum.\n\nOlivi\u2019s own view is that the verbum should be identified\nwith a particular act of thought: \u201cour mental word is our actual\nthought\u201d (Tractatus de verbo 6.2.1). When we\nengage in abstract intellectual cognition, Olivi says, \u201cnothing\nserving as an object is really abstracted or formed that differs from\nthe act of consideration already mentioned\u201d (ibid., 6.2.3). His\nSumma offers a concise characterization:\n\n\nThis [sort of intervening concept] ought not to be called a\nverbum, nor can [such a concept] be anything other than the act\nof consideration itself or a memory species formed through that act.\n(Summa II q. 74, p. 121)\n\n\nThere are, then, acts of intellect, but there are no separate inner\nconcepts that are the objects of those acts. Call this an act theory\nof the verbum.\n\nWhy is this act theory superior to an object theory? One line of\nargument holds that the object theory \u201ccontains in itself\nobvious absurdities and thus contradicts sound reason\u201d\n(Tractatus de verbo 6.2.2). This claim is argued in\ndifferent ways, with the following dilemma often playing a crucial\nrole: On one hand the verbum is said to be the product of\nintellectual cognition. But on the other hand the verbum is\nsaid to be required for cognition as the \u201cfirst thing\nunderstood.\u201d How can it be both? Olivi thinks his opponents will\nhave to maintain that in some way the verbum is the product of\none act of intellect and the object of a second. This leads him to\nargue that his opponents are treating the verbum as merely a\nmemory. But Olivi is happy to countenance representations of this\nsort. Thus the object theory collapses into the act theory.\n\nThe second line of attack holds that the theory lacks support because\n\u201cthere is no necessity or utility in postulating such a\nverbum\u201d (Tractatus de verbo 6.2.3). Here Olivi\nconsiders two parallel lines of argument that a proponent of the\nmental word might make against this charge of superfluity.\n\n\nFirst, [\u2026] we experience in ourselves that we form in our mind\nnew concepts of many propositions and conclusions. These concepts\nremain in us later and we return to them when we want to remember such\npropositions. [\u2026] Second, [\u2026] from individuals seen or\nimagined by us we abstract and form defining characterizations of\ntheir universal features [\u2026] and we come back to these when we\nwish to view such universal features. (Tractatus de\nverbo 6.2.3)\n\n\nEach argument appeals to our experience of forming within ourselves\nabstract ideas: in the first case propositional ideas, in the second\nuniversals. Intellect in each case is said to form a verbum.\nOlivi replies that no such inner word is necessary. In each case we\nhave an act of conceptual thought, but no object is formed in\nintellect over and above the act of thinking itself. Indeed, if\nanything, such an object \u201cwould be an impediment\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014alluding to the epistemological difficulties discussed\nin the previous section.\n\nBy eliminating the representations that might intervene between\nintellect and external reality, Olivi gives us what we might be\ntempted to think of as a direct realist theory of intellectual\ncognition. Yet direct realism faces a serious problem at the\nintellectual level, a problem that Olivi\u2019s discussion fails to\nacknowledge. Direct realism is attractive as a theory of sensation\nbecause it seems clear what the objects of sensation are. But what are\nwe directly in touch with when our intellect thinks abstractly or\npropositionally? One answer to this question is Platonism: universals\nand/or propositions have some kind of abstract mode of existence,\nindependently of the human mind. Like almost all the scholastics,\nOlivi firmly rejects this kind of account (Summa II q. 13).\nAnother kind of answer, sometimes called conceptualism, treats\nuniversals and/or propositions as mental constructs. Defenders of the\nobject theory can take this approach. They can hold that although\nthere are no universals or propositions in external things (in\nre), there are universals and propositions in the mind (in\nmente). The verbum, serving as universal or as proposition,\nwill (in some cautiously described sense) be the object of\nthought.\n\nOlivi\u2019s act theory would seem to rule out this kind of\nconceptualism. But what then will Olivi put in its place? He speaks of\nintellect\u2019s \u201cattending to and considering the real\ncharacter of a common or specific nature\u201d (Tractatus de\nverbo 6.2.3; Pasnau 1999, 271\u2013276), as if he has an\nunproblematic account of intellect\u2019s relationship to the\nexternal world. Yet he says nothing to clarify the status of this\nrelationship. He simply does not seem to have recognized the problem\nof abstract knowledge as a fundamental metaphysical motivation for the\nobject theory. In this respect his overall account, although\nconceptually innovative, remains fundamentally incomplete.\n2.3.4 Self-Awareness and reflexivity\n\nOlivi extensively discusses various types of self-reflexivity in his\nwritings. He adopts the traditional idea that the intellect is capable\nof turning reflexively toward itself, but he also attributes certain\ntypes of reflexivity to the sensory powers of the soul and argues that\nthe will is a reflexive power.\n\nThe most rudimentary type of self-reflexivity takes place in the sense\nof touch. Aristotle argues in De anima II.11 that the organ of\nthe sense of touch is the heart and that the flesh of the body is\nnothing but the medium that transmits the sensations from an external\nobject to the heart. Olivi rejects the Aristotelian theory. He thinks\nthat the whole body functions as the organ of the sense of touch.\nMoreover, he argues that the body is the primary object of the sense\nof touch, while external objects are perceived secondarily by\nperceiving the harmful and beneficial changes that they cause in the\nbody. This position leads to the obvious problem that the sense of\ntouch seems to be a reflexive power, as it is capable of sensing the\nstate of its own organ. Olivi recognizes this problem and gives two\npossible solutions: either the sense of touch which is in one place of\nthe body senses the state of the adjacent part of the body, or the\nsense of touch really is capable of a certain type of reflexivity. In\nthe latter case, Olivi argues, the sense of touch would be capable of\nsensing the state of its own organ but not its own act or itself as a\npsychological power. He does not make up his mind between these two\nexplanations, but he clearly thinks that the sense of touch enables a\ncertain kind of bodily self-perception. Inasmuch as every animal has\nthe sense of touch, it follows that even the simplest animals are\ncapable of perceiving their bodies (Summa II q. 61, pp.\n575\u201385; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2008a; Toivanen 2013a).\n\nThe sense of touch is not the only sensory power that is capable of\nreflexivity. Another such power is the so-called common\nsense\u2014the highest cognitive power of the animal soul and the\nonly internal sense Olivi acknowledges. Although he does not provide a\nsystematic discussion of the reflexivity of the common sense, he\nsuggests in several places that it is capable of apprehending its own\nactivity by turning toward itself incompletely (semiplene)\n(Summa II q. 62, p. 595). This ability is related to the\nAristotelian conception of perception of perception, but Olivi\nsuggests something more than the traditional Aristotelian picture.\nFollowing Augustine, he argues that animals are aware of their own\nbodies and the purpose and value of their organs and body parts, since\notherwise they would not be able to use their bodies effectively and\npreserve their lives:\n\n\nWhen a dog or a snake sacrifices one of its members in order to save\nits head or sacrifices some part in order to save the whole, then it\nprefers the whole over the part and the head over the other member.\nTherefore, these animals must have some common power which shows both\nextremes simultaneously, their mutual comparison, and the preference\nof one over the other\u2014although it does not do this with the same\nfullness and degree of reflexive judgement as does the intellect.\n(Summa II q. 62, p. 588)\n\n\nThe common sense enables animals to perceive their own bodies, the\nparts and their functions, and the relative value of the parts for the\nwell-being of the animal as a whole, thus making animals capable of\nself-preservation that goes beyond the ability to avoid pain (see\nToivanen 2013b).\n\nThe difference between intellectual self-reflexivity and the\nreflexivity of the common sense is based on the spiritual nature of\nthe intellectual soul. Unlike the common sense, the intellectual mind\nis spiritual and immaterial and therefore capable of being directly\nand immediately aware of itself. Certain authors (most notably\nAquinas) had argued that this kind of direct awareness is not possible\nbecause considered in itself the intellect is fully potential. It must\nbe actualized by thinking something else before it can be cognized. By\ncontrast, Olivi argues that the soul is directly aware of itself.\n\n\nThe soul knows or is able to know itself in two ways. The first of\nthem is an experiential and as if tactile sensation by which the soul\nundoubtedly senses that it is, lives, cognizes, wills, sees, hears,\nmoves the body, and likewise for its other acts, whose principle and\nsubject it knows and senses itself to be. And this [happens] to such\nan extent that it cannot actually know or consider any object or any\nact without always knowing and sensing itself to be the subject\n(suppositum) of the act by which it knows and considers that\n[object or act] \u2026 The other way of knowing itself is by\nreasoning. In this way the soul investigates the genera and\ndifferences that it does not know in the first way. (Summa II\nq. 76, pp. 146\u201347)\n\n\nBy separating these two types of knowledge that the soul or mind has\nof itself, Olivi is in a position to explain why we do not have\ncertain knowledge of the nature of the soul. The direct awareness\ntells us only that the soul lives and acts, but in order to know the\nessence of the soul, we must compare this immediate awareness to our\nknowledge of the species and genera of the things in the world, and\nthis process is not infallible (Putallaz 1991; Brower-Toland\n2013).\n\nThe highest level of reflexivity, however, is found in the will,\nbecause only the will is capable of moving itself to action. In order\nto be free, the will has to be able to move itself in such a way that\nit can also refrain from moving itself. It has this ability because it\nis related to itself as a mover to a moved thing: \u201cInsofar as\nthe will is free, it has another kind of reflexivity upon itself which\nthe intellect lacks: for, the will is turned toward itself not only as\nto an object, but also as a mover to a moved thing\u201d (Summa\nII q. 51, p. 115). In fact, the reflexivity of the intellect is\nbased on the will\u2019s ability to direct other powers of the soul.\n(Summa II q. 57, pp. 364\u201366; ibid., q. 58, pp.\n421\u201323.) Usually human beings are able to control themselves by\ntheir will, and this ability is what makes them persons. Reflexivity\nof the will plays a crucial role in the process, as we can see from a\npassage in which Olivi explains how sleep affects the psychological\nprocesses of the soul:\n\n\nSometimes the attention of the superior part of the soul is in such a\nstate that it is able to invent and form various things with respect\nto the cognitive powers and, similarly, to refuse and approve with\nrespect to appetitive powers; then it is said to deliberate and\ncombine, to consent and choose. And nevertheless it does not move to\nthese acts freely, as it does when awake, because it moves itself to\nthese acts in such a way that it does not have a power to move itself\notherwise. (Summa II q. 59, p. 564)\n\n\nExperience shows that the will can act also when a person is asleep,\nas we often make choices in our dreams. But because the reflexivity of\nthe will is hindered, it does not make these choices freely. In this\nway, the ability to move the will to its acts is the crucial factor\nthat makes us free, and our personhood is dependent on the highest\ntype of reflexivity, which ensures that our choices and actions\noriginate in us.\n3. Practical Philosophy\n3.1 Ethics\n3.1.1 Virtue ethics\n\nLike most medieval authors, Olivi can be understood as a virtue\nethicist. As with many of them, however, he does not defend virtue\nethics in its strict Aristotelian guise. To begin with, he criticizes\nthe Thomistic position, according to which some moral virtues are in\nthe sensory part of the soul, but he is also critical of Bonaventure,\nwho held that virtues belong to the free choice (liberum\narbitrium) and thus include both the will and the intellect.\nInstead, Olivi places all virtues, including prudence, firmly in the\nwill. Other powers of the soul may participate in these virtues due to\ntheir connection to the will, but apart from this connection they have\nno real virtues (Kent 1995, 233\u201336; Summa III q. 4, pp.\n224\u201325, 231). Virtues, on Olivi\u2019s account, are stable\ndispositions (or habits, habitus) of the will, which are\ngenerated by repeated actions, and they make good choices easier for\nthe agent (Summa II q. 58, p. 432).\n\nMoreover, Olivi is careful to secure the freedom and autonomy of the\nwill even against its own dispositions: virtues and vices do not\ndetermine our choices. A virtuous person is more likely to make good\nchoices than a vicious one, but ultimately every choice is always up\nto the will (Bobiller 2020, 155\u201356), and the agent can always\nact against her virtuous or vicious dispositions. Olivi emphasizes\nthat this kind of freedom is a necessary condition for being morally\nresponsible of one\u2019s actions: \u201cWhere the freedom of the\nwill is missing, there is absolutely no ground for merit and\ndemerit\u201d (Summa II q. 57, 337). Another important aspect\nof Olivi\u2019s virtue ethics is that he plays down the role of\nexternal action and focuses instead on the will of the agent: the\nmoral value of our actions stems from the internal intention and the\nfree decision to perform those actions (see, e.g. Summa II q.\n113, p. 307; ibid., q. 118, p. 443; Normore 2004, p. 144).\n\nDue to the emphasis on the freedom of the will and the internal\nintention, the individual moral agent is at the center of\nOlivi\u2019s ethics. In particular, his notions of person and\npersonhood are ethically significant, as they comprise two properties\nthat make human beings moral agents: awareness of oneself as the\nsubject and origin of one\u2019s actions and choices, and freedom of\nthe will. The moral agent, for Olivi, is first and foremost a free\nperson, an autonomous individual, who is aware of her own actions as\nsomething that originates in her and who must judge the moral worth of\nher choices by herself (Bobillier 2020, 27\u2013137). In order to\nmake this judgement, the agent must be able to reflect her own (past,\npresent, future) choices against the objective normative order that is\nthe natural law/will of God, which they know via innate conscience and\n\u201cexperiential taste\u201d that explains the affective aspect of\nmoral knowledge (Bobillier 2020, 144\u201367; Summa II qq.\n81\u201382).\n\nOlivi\u2019s radical voluntarism leads him also to treat Aristotelian\nakrasia in a special way: literally as weakness of the\nwill that explains why the agent chooses agains his better\nknowledge. Genuine cases of akrasia (in which the person is not making\nan intellectual error, e.g., due to the influence of emotions) exist\nand they reveal the fundamental nature of the will, namely, that its\nfreedom is not bound by intellectual judgments or emotional outbursts\n(Kent 1984, 184\u2013205; Bobillier 2020, 239, 252\u201360). Olivi\nargues explicitly against the view he takes to be Aristotle\u2019s,\nnamely that the conclusion of the practical syllogism is action or\nnecessarily turns into action. He emphasizes that since the will is\nabsolutely free, the conclusion of the practical syllogism must be\naccepted by the will before it turns into action, and the will can\nalways reject the conclusion, thus leading the agent to reconsider the\nsituation at hand. Moreover, he thinks that when an akratic person\nchooses to perform a morally wrong action, he may be fully aware that\nit is against the moral law. In Olivi\u2019s view, human beings are\nable to consider one and the same action from many angles at the same\ntime; they can think simultaneously several universal premises and\ncombine them freely with the particular premise, thus reaching\ncontrary conclusions: this act of fornication is both morally\nblameworthy and pleasant, and I am free to choose whether I go\nfor it or not (Summa II qq. 85\u201386, 186\u201391; ibid.,\nq. 57, pp. 309\u201310; see Toivanen 2012).\n\nThus, an akratic person knows actually that what he is about to do is\na sin, but his knowledge is theoretical and lacks the experiential\naffective aspect. By contrast, he finds the sinful action pleasant\nbecause his thought concerning it has this aspect to it (Bobillier\n2020, 257\u201358; Summa II q. 86, p. 193). To be sure, even\nthis experiential mode of thinking does not determine the will, and\nthus an akratic can always decide to do otherwise, and he is fully\nresponsible for his choice. Olivi criticizes the Aristotelian theory\nfor taking away the responsibility due to a momentary lack of\nunderstanding, caused by emotion (see e.g. Bobillier 2020, pp.\n254\u201356). In the end, there is no other explanation for bad\nchoices except that the person wills to make them.\n\nOne central difference between Olivi\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\napproaches to virtue ethics is that while the latter thinks that a\nperson\u2019s moral character determines how he acts after the\npractical reasoning is done, Olivi argues that there always remains a\nchoice. Although one\u2019s moral character may statistically guide\nhim to choose a certain type of action, Olivi\u2019s focus is more on\nthe actual choice, which is in all cases completely free. Moral\neducation and habituation may improve one\u2019s ability to make\nmorally good choices, but ultimately moral improvement is a matter of\nsimply starting to do the right thing instead of wrong one. Thus,\nOlivi is a virtue ethicist but his virtue ethics is of a different\nbreed than Aristotle\u2019s.\n3.1.2 Unity of virtues\n\nOne question that late thirteenth-century authors discussed was\nrelated to the unity of the virtues. It was prompted by\nAugustine\u2019s critique of the Stoic position as well as by\nCicero\u2019s De officiis (Kent 1984, pp. 523\u201325), and\nit received a new impetus with Aristotle\u2019s argument that a\nvirtuous person necessarily has all virtues of character because\nprudence is necessary for each genuine virtue, and prudence in turn\nentails all other virtues (EN 6.12\u201313). The idea is\nroughly that a prudent person can grasp what is the best course of\naction all things considered, and this requires finding a\ncorrect balance that meets the requirements of all virtues: one who\nacts bravely must also act justly because unjust bravery is not a real\nvirtue.\n\nMany medieval philosophers accepted this view, but not all, and\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century critical voices were raised;\nOlivi seems to be one of the first to reject it completely. He thinks\nthat it is possible to have one virtue while lacking others, and his\nstrategy to ward off the Aristotelian theory is to argue that prudence\nitself is not one monolithic whole. Even if prudence turns out to be\nnecessary for every moral virtue, it is possible to possess only the\npart of prudence that is proper to one particular virtue:\n\n\n[\u2026] as moral virtue contains many virtues that differ from each\nother by their genera and species, so prudence contains many prudences\nor many partial dispositions. (Summa III q. 6, p. 277)\n\n\nIt is possible to, e.g., exercise moderation with respect to food and\ndrink and yet be covetous and amass money without limits, and the\nprudence that aids the agent to exercise moderation does not\nnecessarily convince him of the viciousness of covetousness. Virtues\nare essentially independent of each other. However, Olivi acknowledges\nthe unity of virtues in the sense that in order to become a fully\nvirtuous person, one must acquire all specific virtues. A virtuous\nagent functions as the unifying factor (Wood 1997, pp.\n51\u201353).\n\nMoreover, Olivi thinks that virtues may support each other in\npractical life. In particular, he argues that voluntary poverty is not\nonly one of the virtues but actually the highest virtue (QPE q.\n8, p. 85). It is not suitable for everyone but only for those who are\nable to follow Franciscan ideals. However, for the latter it proves to\nbe essential as it leads to a host of other virtues such as chastity,\nfortitude, generosity, magnanimity\u2014and to humility, which Olivi\nconsiders as abandonment of oneself and submission to the will of God\n(Bobillier 2020, 193\u2013222). In contrast to humility, wrongly\ndirected self-love and pride are the sources of all vices (Bobillier\n2020, pp. 217\u201321, pp. 236\u201352).\n3.2 Political Philosophy\n3.2.1 Poverty\n\nAlthough Olivi did not leave behind systematic treatises on political\nphilosophy, his works touched upon several politically loaded\ntheological and philosophical ideas. In particular, he played a\ncentral role in the controversy over how rigorously to understand the\nFranciscan vow of poverty, which would have a lasting effect on\nmedieval political reality (Burr 1989, 2001). Although the controversy\ncentered on Franciscan poverty and was thus strongly motivated by\ntheological worries and Church politics, it is not difficult to see\nthat it has several philosophical dimensions to it. For instance, it\nhas been argued that the modern conception of subjective rights was\nfirst developed in the debate between the Franciscan order and the\npope over the correct interpretation of poverty and the vow (see,\ne.g., van Duffel 2010).\n\nFranciscans held that the vow of poverty requires renouncing ownership\n(dominium), but that using products owned by someone\nelse (e.g., the Church) does not violate the vow. However, the\nquestion that divided them in the latter half of the thirteenth\ncentury was whether the vow requires that, even when merely using the\ngoods of another, one adheres to strict standards of austerity, the\nso-called \u201cpoor use\u201d (usus pauper). Olivi insisted\non these strict standards but claimed that they are part of the vow\nonly indeterminately. This means first that not every violation is a\nmortal sin, provided that one\u2019s general tendency is to strive\nfor spiritual humility by living poorly. It also means that what\nexactly counts as poor use depends on the circumstances and situation,\nsince it is impossible to find a precise and fixed line between poor\nand lax use of commodities. In other words, Olivi admitted a certain\nlatitude and flexibility in this notion (Burr 2001, pp.\n51\u201353).\n\nAnother central idea for Olivi was that one should not obey\none\u2019s superiors if obeying their commands entails sinful action\nor the violation of the Franciscan vow, thus endangering one\u2019s\nsalvation. Given Olivi\u2019s flexible view of the scope of the poor\nuse, this last restriction makes the limit between the duties of\nobedience and disobedience vague. Each individual friar must judge in\nhis own conscience whether he should obey or disobey (and ultimately\nprotest) the commands of their superiors. It is not surprising that\nOlivi\u2019s theoretical model of the vow, in conjunction with the\npotential for disobedience, fueled the political controversy within\nthe Franciscan order and the Church (Burr 2001, pp. 64\u201365).\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, one of the most important aspects of\nOlivi\u2019s view is the connection between the freedom of the will\nand the evangelical vow\u2019s renunciation of ownership understood\nas dominion (dominium). The idea that ownership is a form of\ndominion stems from a more general theory according to which freedom\nof the will can be understood as a dominion that one has over\none\u2019s will. This dominion is extended to one\u2019s body and\nexternal actions, and ultimately to external goods. Olivi thinks that\nthe Franciscan vow means not only giving up the dominion over external\ngoods but also over one\u2019s own actions (obedience) and ultimately\none\u2019s own freedom, as it means subjection to the will of God.\nYet, when someone voluntarily subjects his will to God, he\nparadoxically proclaims his ultimate freedom: the vow must be\ncontinuously renewed. The choice to give up the freedom of the will is\na voluntary choice that is freely given every moment as long as one\nkeeps to the vow (QPE, q. 8, p. 169; QPE, q. 14, p.\n135; Piron 1996; Toivanen 2016a).\n3.2.2 The nature of political power\n\nOne of the most important texts where Olivi deals with political\nphilosophy is his Quid ponat ius (= Summa IV q. 1). His aim in\nthis text is to provide a theoretical foundation for his discussion on\nthe sacraments, and he considers it useful to start with a detailed\nanalysis of the ontology of political power and property rights.\nAlthough it has been pointed out that Olivi seems to prefer a mixed\nform of government (Blythe 1992, pp. 151\u201352), this particular\ntext does not aim at offering a political theory; it is a\nphilosophical exercise in social ontology, which centers on a question\nconcerning the ontological foundation of relational terms such as\n\u2018right\u2019 (ius), \u2018authority\u2019\n(auctoritas), \u2018power\u2019 (potestas),\n\u2018obligation\u2019 (obligatio), and \u2018property\nright\u2019 (proprietas). (For discussion, see Piron 1996,\n2016; Rode 2014, 2016; Toivanen 2016a.)\n\nOlivi develops his view in relation to two opposing views. According\nto the first view, there must be something real in the end-terms of\nthese relations because otherwise they would not be real: \u201ca\nrelation that posits nothing in the related things is only a relation\naccording to what is said (relatio secundum dici) [\u2026]\nbut it is clear that the power of a king, or any real jurisdiction, or\nobligation, or subordination of some people are really actual even\nwhen none of us thinks or talks about them\u201d (Summa IV q.\n1, par. 7). The second view holds that relational properties such as\ndominium are radically different from natural properties, and\nthat no ontological change takes place when, for instance, someone is\ncrowned a king. Olivi seeks for a position between these two views,\nand he finds one when he argues that relations of this kind are based\non rationes reales (see\n \u00a7 2.1).\n They are real relations in the sense that they do not depend on\nsomeone actually thinking of them but they do not entail any real\n(Aristotelian) ontological addition to the relata.\n\nThe relation that a ruler has to the subjects is a form of dominion,\nand it it principally related to the will of the ruler:\n\n\nTherefore, since this kind of power does not add anything intrinsic to\nthe person of the king, it can relate to the whole person of the king\nin such a way that it will not determinately relate to any of his\npowers, unless it perhaps relates to the free will (liberum\narbitrium) and the powers that are bound to it, insofar as they\nare such. (Summa IV q. 1, par. 53)\n\n\nCoronation extends the dominion of the king over his subjects, and\nthis is due to the human ability to change the normative reality by\nestablishing new relations between human beings, between human beings\nand property, and so forth (Rode 2014, pp. 377\u201378). Although the\nnormative reality ultimately depends on the will of God and natural\nlaw (Rode 2016, pp. 117\u201319), the human will plays an important\nrole in the detailed explanation of how it works.\n3.2.3 Economic theory\n\nIn addition to his philosophical and theological ambitions, Olivi took\npart in a theoretical discussion concerning economic justice. He\ncomposed a short treatise Tractatus de contractibus (ed. Piron\n2012) while he was working at the Franciscan studium generale\nof Narbonne in mid-1290s. The work is a theoretical treatise that is\nrelated to the moral dimension of economic activities and it was\nprobably occasioned by pastoral duties that Franciscan friars had in\nan urban context. Although Olivi\u2019s views can be traced back to\nearlier discussions on Roman and Canon law, as well as other works\ndealing with just price, scholars have also argued that his overall\napproach profoundly changed medieval economic theory (Kaye 1998, 2014;\nLangholm 1992, 1998; Piron 2012; Todeschini 2009; a more critical\nevaluation is Kirshner and Lo Prete 1984).\n\nIn De contractibus Olivi discusses several topics related to\nthe morality of economic activity, such as contracts, commerce, usury,\nvalue, and capital. The first question of the treatise serves as an\nillustrative example of his general approach to economics. It focuses\non the notion of just price, which Olivi analyzes with the intention\nof setting normative limits that regulate but do not completely\nprevent economic activity. As in Quid ponat ius, he proposes a\ntheory that reconciles two sets of opposing arguments. According to\nthe first set of arguments, a voluntary contract between a buyer and a\nseller suffices to establish a just price. The price the parties\nfreely agree upon is just, because any other way of setting the just\nprice would make commercial activities liable to immorality. Without\nfull knowledge of the just price, the buyer and the seller might\naccidentally deviate from it and thus sin. By contrast, the second set\nof arguments aims to prove that there must be objectively determinable\nlimits for the just price. Otherwise there might be a situation in\nwhich someone charges an extremely high price for a glass of water,\nand one who is dying of thirst pays it voluntarily, thereby making the\nprice just. Thus, all deviations from the objectively just price are\nagainst the principles of justice.\n\nOlivi treats just price in a similar way as usus pauper: it\ncannot be a pre-fixed and universally applicable single point but\nthere must be some amount of latitude and flexibility to it. He adopts\nthe Aristotelian idea of virtuous action as a middle-point between two\nopposing vices: just as virtue is not a fixed middle that can be known\na priori but depends on the context and situation, so just price has\nlimits but is open to variation due to various contextual factors.\n(Piron 2012, p. 45.) There are normative limits for the just\nprice\u2014for instance, vital needs may force the buyer to agree on\na price that is unjust, but the seller should refrain from asking more\nthan a fair price. Yet, the flexibility of the limits of just price\nleave room for economic activity and allow merchants to profit, and\nwithin these limits the participants agree on the price freely. Olivi\nalso submits that if neither party deceives the other and both enter\nthe transaction freely (no compelling circumstances obtain), one may\neven give away one\u2019s commodities for free.\n\nOlivi provides more detailed set of criteria for determining the\nlimits of just price in various situations in scholastic literature\n(Kaye 2014, p. 114). Among these criteria are the obvious quality of\nthe commodity, the materials and the amount of work needed to produce\nit, and rarity, but also individual desires and personal values (De\ncontractibus 1.1, pp. 98\u2013102; Toivanen 2016b). Further, he\nargues that the just price is affected by social factors such as\ncommon estimation and common needs, and that ultimately economic\nactivity exists for the sake of the common good of the community\n(Tractatus de contractibus 1.2, pp. 108\u201310). In this way,\nOlivi\u2019s analysis reflects the fact that medieval economic\ndiscourse was fundamentally normative and related to moral\ntheology\u2014unlike contemporary economics, which is more\ndescriptive and lacks the normative dimension (Piron 2012).",
