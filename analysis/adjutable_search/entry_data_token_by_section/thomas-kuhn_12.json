    "main_text": "Criticism and Influence || Kuhn and Social Science\n6.3 Kuhn and Social Science\nKuhn\u2019s influence outside of professional philosophy of science may\nhave been even greater than it was within it. The social sciences in\nparticular took up Kuhn with enthusiasm.  There are primarily two\nreasons for this.  First, Kuhn\u2019s picture of science appeared to permit\na more liberal conception of what science is than hitherto, one that\ncould be taken to include disciplines such as sociology and\npsychoanalysis.  Secondly, Kuhn\u2019s rejection of rules as determining\nscientific outcomes appeared to permit appeal to other factors,\nexternal to science, in explaining why a scientific revolution took\nthe course that it did.\nThe status as genuine sciences of what we now call the social and\nhuman sciences has widely been held in doubt.  Such disciplines lack\nthe remarkable track record of established natural sciences and seem\nto differ also in the methods they employ.  More specifically they\nfail by pre-Kuhnian philosophical criteria of sciencehood. On the one\nhand, positivists required of a science that it should be verifiable\nby reference to its predictive successes.  On the other, Popper\u2019s\ncriterion was that a science should be potentially falsifiable by a\nprediction of the theory.  Yet psychoanalysis, sociology and even\neconomics have difficulty in making precise predictions at all, let\nalone ones that provide for clear confirmation or unambiguous\nrefutation.  Kuhn\u2019s picture of a mature science as being dominated by\na paradigm that generated sui generis puzzles and criteria for\nassessing solutions to them could much more easily accommodate these\ndisciplines.  For example, Popper famously complained that\npsychoanalysis could not be scientific because it resists\nfalsification.  Kuhn\u2019s account argues that resisting falsification is\nprecisely what every disciplinary matrix in science does.\nEven disciplines that could not claim to be dominated by a settled\nparadigm but were beset by competing schools with different\nfundamental ideas could appeal to Kuhn\u2019s description of the\npre-paradigm state of a science in its infancy.  Consequently Kuhn\u2019s\nanalysis was popular among those seeking legitimacy as science (and\nconsequently kudos and funding) for their new disciplines.  Kuhn\nhimself did not especially promote such extensions of his views, and\nindeed cast doubt upon them.  He denied that psychoanalysis is a\nscience and argued that there are reasons why some fields within the\nsocial sciences could not sustain extended periods of puzzle-solving\nnormal science (1991b).  Although, he says, the natural sciences\ninvolve interpretation just as human and social sciences do, one\ndifference is that hermeneutic re-interpretation, the search for new\nand deeper intepretations, is the essence of many social scientific\nenterprises.  This contrasts with the natural sciences where an\nestablished and unchanging interpretation (e.g. of the heavens) is a\npre-condition of normal science.  Re-intepretation is the result of a\nscientific revolution and is typically resisted rather than actively\nsought. Another reason why regular reinterpretation is part of the\nhuman sciences and not the natural sciences is that social and\npolitical systems are themselves changing in ways that call for new\ninterpretations, whereas the subject matter of the natural sciences is\nconstant in the relevant respects, permitting a puzzle-solving\ntradition as well as a standing source of revolution-generating\nanomalies.\nA rather different influence on social science was Kuhn\u2019s influence\non the development of social studies of science itself, in particular\nthe \u2018Sociology of Scientific Knowledge\u2019. A central claim\nof Kuhn\u2019s work is that scientists do not make their judgments as the\nresult of consciously or unconsciously following rules.  Their\njudgments are nonetheless tightly constrained during normal science by\nthe example of the guiding paradigm.  During a revolution they are\nreleased from these constraints (though not completely).  Consequently\nthere is a gap left for other factors to explain scientific judgments.\nKuhn himself suggests in The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions that Sun worship may have made Kepler a Copernican\nand that in other cases, facts about an individual\u2019s life history,\npersonality or even nationality and reputation may play a role\n(1962/70a, 152\u20133).  Later Kuhn repeated the point, with the additional\nexamples of German Romanticism, which disposed certain scientists to\nrecognize and accept energy conservation, and British social thought\nwhich enabled acceptance of Darwinism (1977c, 325). Such suggestions\nwere taken up as providing an opportunity for a new kind of study of\nscience, showing how social and political factors external to science\ninfluence the outcome of scientific debates. In what has become known\nas social constructivism/constructionism (e.g. Pickering 1984) this\ninfluence is taken to be central, not marginal, and to extend to the\nvery content of accepted theories. Kuhn\u2019s claim and its exploitation\ncan be seen as analogous to or even an instance of the exploitation of\nthe (alleged) underdetermination of theory by evidence (c.f. Kuhn\n1992, 7).  Feminists and social theorists (e.g. Nelson 1993) have\nargued that the fact that the evidence, or, in Kuhn\u2019s case, the shared\nvalues of science, do not fix a single choice of theory, allows\nexternal factors to determine the final outcome (see Martin 1991 and\nSchiebinger 1999 for feminist social constructivism).  Furthermore,\nthe fact that Kuhn identified values as what guide judgment\nopens up the possibility that scientists ought to employ different\nvalues, as has been argued by feminist and post-colonial writers\n(e.g. Longino 1994).\nKuhn himself, however, showed only limited sympathy for such\ndevelopments. In his \u201cThe Trouble with the Historical Philosophy\nof Science\u201d (1992) Kuhn derides those who take the view that in\nthe \u2018negotiations\u2019 that determine the accepted outcome of\nan experiment or its theoretical significance, all that\ncounts are the interests and power relations among the\nparticipants. Kuhn targeted the proponents of the Strong Programme in\nthe Sociology of Scientific Knowledge with such comments; and even if\nthis is not entirely fair to the Strong Programme, it reflects Kuhn\u2019s\nown view that the primary determinants of the outcome of a scientific\nepisode are to be found within science. External history of science\nseeks causes of scientific change in social, political, religious and\nother developments of science. Kuhn sees his work as \u201cpretty\nstraight internalist\u201d (2000: 287).  First, the five values Kuhn\nascribes to all science are in his view constitutive of science.  An\nenterprise could have different values but it would not be science\n(1977c, 331; 1993, 338).  Secondly, when a scientist is influenced by\nindividual or other factors in applying these values or in coming to a\njudgment when these values are not decisive, those influencing factors\nwill typically themselves come from within science (especially in\nmodern, professionalized science). Personality may play a role in the\nacceptance of a theory, because, for example, one scientist is more\nrisk-averse than another (1977c, 325)\u2014but that is still a\nrelationship to the scientific evidence. Even when reputation plays a\npart, it is typically scientific reputation that encourages\nthe community to back the opinion of an eminent scientist.  Thirdly,\nin a large community such variable factors will tend to cancel out.\nKuhn supposes that individual differences are normally distributed and\nthat a judgment corresponding to the mean of the distribution will\nalso correspond to the judgment that would, hypothetically, be\ndemanded by the rules of scientific method, as traditionally conceived\n(1977c, 333).  Moreover, the existence of differences of response\nwithin the leeway provided by shared values is crucial to science,\nsince it permits \u201crational men to disagree\u201d (1977c, 332)\nand thus to commit themselves to rival theories.  Thus the looseness\nof values and the differences they permit \u201cmay . . . appear an\nindispensable means of spreading the risk which the introduction or\nsupport of novelty always entails\u201d (Ibid.).\n",
