    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\n\nThe Silloi, in hexameter verse, has already been mentioned.\nThe other poem from which a few fragments survive was called\nIndalmoi (Images or Appearances), which was\nin elegiac couplets (alternating hexameters and pentameters). The\nsignificance of this title is by no means clear. It might refer to the\n\u201cappearances\u201d on the basis of which Pyrrhonists are\ncompelled to make their decisions; one of the surviving lines from the\npoem reads \u201cBut the appearance [to phainomenon] is\npowerful everywhere, wherever it comes\u201d (quoted in Diogenes\nLaertius 9.105), and most scholars have taken this to point to the\nimportance of appearances in shaping our actions. Another possibility\nis that the \u2018images\u2019 referred to in the title are images\nof Pyrrho himself, and that the poem was a depiction of Pyrrho and his\nblissful tranquility; the longest surviving fragment from the\npoem\u2014a sequence of seven lines pieced together from three\npassages in Diogenes Laertius and Sextus Empiricus\u2014certainly\nfits this description. A third suggestion is that \u2018images\u2019\nor \u2018appearances\u2019 is to be taken in a negative sense,\nreferring to the fictions or illusions by which naive non-Pyrrhonists\nare taken in. Possible support for this comes from a single pentameter\nline, which is regularly assigned to the Indalmoi because of\nthe meter. This reads \u201cbut these things are judged by mind [or:\nby convention] on the part of humans\u201d (Sextus Empiricus\nM 11.140); the context suggests that the \u2018things\u2019\nin question are things (wrongly) taken to be by nature good or bad.\nNone of these proposals as to the character of the work can be ruled\nout, but none can be regarded as more than conjecture. With the\nexception of a four-line fragment about \u201cthe nature of the\ndivine and the good\u201d, which is probably the most contentious of\nall the fragments of Timon, no other lines survive beyond the three\npassages just referred to. (See the discussion of \u201cThe Nature of\nthe Divine and the Good\u201d in Section 6 of the entry on\n Pyrrho,\n for a brief account of the difficulties surrounding this fragment.)\nNor do we have any general description of the work (unlike in the case\nof the Silloi\u2014see the next section); Diogenes Laertius\ndoes not even include it in his list of Timon\u2019s works, although\nhe does elsewhere cite it. Thus despite the importance of the few\nsurviving pieces of the Indalmoi, the poem as a whole is\nalmost entirely opaque to us.\n\nDiogenes (9.110) claims that, in addition to the poems already\nmentioned, Timon wrote sixty tragedies and thirty comedies, as well as\nepics, satyr plays and kinaidoi (usually translated\n\u2018obscene poems\u2019\u2014kinaidos normally means\n\u2018catamite\u2019; see Strabo 14.1.41, Athenaeus XIV.620e\u2013f\nfor what appear to be other references to the same verse form). He\nsays that Timon indulged in poetry while taking time off from\nphilosophy; but the poems he lists in this context include the\nSilloi, which certainly qualifies as part of Timon\u2019s\nphilosophical activity. The report is confused in other ways as well;\nin any case, no trace of this voluminous non-philosophical corpus, if\nit ever existed, seems to have survived. (There are a few lines of\nTimon\u2019s verse that cannot be definitely attributed to either the\nSilloi or the Indalmoi; but there is no particular\nreason to believe that they derive from any of these other works.)\n\nThe remaining works attributed to Timon are prose works. Of these the\nmost important is the Pytho. We are told (by Aristocles in\nEusebius, Praeparatio evangelica 14.18.14) that this\ndescribed a meeting and a dialogue between Timon and Pyrrho; Timon\nportrayed himself as encountering Pyrrho by a temple, as he was\nwalking towards Pytho (the region that included Delphi). Whether the\nwork itself was in dialogue form, or merely recounted a dialogue in\nthe third person, is not clear. But it appears that this dialogue\nconsisted of a thorough presentation of Pyrrho\u2019s outlook and\ndemeanor; Diogenes Laertius, in what seems to be a reference to the\nsame work (9.67), says that Timon \u2018clarifies\u2019\n(diasaphei) Pyrrho\u2019s disposition (diathesin)\nin the account that he \u2018goes through\u2019 (diexeisin,\na word often used of detailed exposition). This account will\npresumably have been placed in Pyrrho\u2019s mouth, with Timon\nhimself depicted as an eager pupil. (This motif seems to have been a\nrecurring one in Timon\u2019s writings; fragments from both the\nSilloi and the Indalmoi consist of questions put to\nPyrrho\u2014most probably by Timon himself as speaker\u2014about how\nhe manages to sustain his tranquility.) There is one quotation from\nthe Pytho and one further report about a statement that it\nincluded; both are of some philosophical significance, and will be\ntouched on below, but neither furnishes any additional clues\nconcerning the general character of the Pytho itself. It has\nusually been thought that the setting of the dialogue has symbolic\nsignificance (Delphi being the seat of the important oracle of\nApollo), but the interpretations that have been offered of this are\nvarious. Aristocles offers a summary of an exposition by\u00a0Timon of\nwhat have generally been regarded as\u00a0the central points of\nPyrrho\u2019s philosophy. This is often thought to have occurred in\nthe Pytho,\u00a0but this is no more than plausible\nspeculation. Moreover, though this\u00a0passage certainly alludes to\nsomething that Pyrrho said, it is by no means obvious how much of\nit\u00a0actually reproduces Pyrrho\u2019s ideas and how much is Timon\u2019s own\ndevelopment of these ideas;\u00a0for discussion of this see the entry\non\n Pyrrho.\n\nDiogenes (9.105) mentions a work called On the Senses and\nSextus (M 3.2) mentions a work called Against the\nPhysicists. Again, the specific words or ideas that are\nattributed to Timon in these contexts deserve some discussion, but\nthey tell us little or nothing about the works themselves, beyond what\nthe titles would anyway suggest. It is worth noting, however, that\nthere is no indication that these works consisted of or included\nexposition of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy. Finally, Diogenes tells us\n(9.115) that Timon praised Arcesilaus (who, during Timon\u2019s\nlifetime, took the Academy in a skeptical direction) in a work called\nArcesilaus\u2019 Funeral Banquet\u2014this by contrast with\nhis attacks on him in the Silloi, as Diogenes mentions and as\nwe can confirm from the surviving fragments. This work is generally\ntaken as evidence that Timon outlived Arcesilaus. But given\nTimon\u2019s penchant for elaborate narrative conceits, the inference\nis hazardous. As Clayman (2009), 13\u201315 has made clear, the\nfuneral banquet was a recognized parodic verse form dating back to\nbefore Timon\u2019s day, and by no means requires that its subjects\nbe actually deceased; the genre also gives us grounds for wondering\nwhether the praise of Arcesilaus was partly or even wholly\nmock-praise.\n",
