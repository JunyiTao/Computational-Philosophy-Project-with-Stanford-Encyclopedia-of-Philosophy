    "main_text": "How to Atone\n2. How to Atone\n\nWe have some fairly strong intuitions about what kinds of actions can\natone and many of our stories about atonement illustrate the means\nwhich will be described in this section (McEwan 2001; Stevenson 2015).\nBut with the definitions above we can go a step further than mere\nintuition, for we can explain why these various activities atone: they\ncontribute to reconciliation and help fulfill our moral debts by\nmaking amends\u2014including the debts to withdraw insult to the\nvictim, and to repair insofar as possible the harms of the wrong to\nthe victim and to society.\n\nStump (1988) notes that when we atone we aim to deal with two\nproblems: the problem of past sin and the problem of future sin. The\nformer just is the moral wrong that was done, its harmful effects and\nthe relational rifts due to these. The latter is the problem of the\nfuture wrong that the wrongdoer remains likely to do. The latter is\nkey to atoning because reconciliation is difficult if the victim fears\nthat the wrongdoer will wrong her again in the same sort of way as\nbefore. Furthermore, if part of a wrongdoer\u2019s moral duty is to\nrepair the harms due to the wrong, then the wrongdoer may be required\nto assuage fear and trepidation about potential future violations.\n",
