    "main_text": "In What Sense Was Hume a Newtonian? || Skepticism\n4.2 Skepticism\n\nIn our analysis of Hume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d, we have\nalready encountered Hume\u2019s claim that we are unable to penetrate\ninto the internal constitution of matter\n (section 3).\n So, however else Hume\u2019s skepticism is understood\u2014and it\nhas been the subject of intense scholarly discussion (including the\nso-called \u201cNew Hume\u201d debate, see Read & Richman 2000)\nduring the last three decades\u2014the science of man has skeptical\nimplications with regard to his interpretation of Newton\u2019s\nphilosophy. Hume\u2019s evaluation of Newton is an additional source\nof evidence in understanding the nature of Hume\u2019s skepticism.\nThis evidence reveals that in evaluating Newton\u2019s achievement\nHume is pessimistic about the extent and possibility of knowledge of\nnature. It also shows that Hume rejected important Newtonian\nstandards/criteria in evaluating the claims of natural philosophy.\n\nIn The History of England, Hume writes:\n\n\nBoyle was a great partizan of the mechanical philosophy: a theory,\nwhich, by discovering some of the secrets of nature, and allowing us\nto imagine the rest, is so agreeable to the natural vanity and\ncuriosity of men\u2026While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from\nsome of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the\nimperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her\nultimate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever\nwill remain. (HE VI, 542; emphasis added)\n\n\nThis quote reveals crucial details about Hume\u2019s position in\nthree areas: a) Hume\u2019s understanding of the relative merits of\nNewton\u2019s philosophy and the mechanical philosophy of Boyle; b)\nHume\u2019s attitude toward criteria of intelligibility; c)\nHume\u2019s skepticism.\n\nFirst, Hume treats Newton\u2019s account as a refutation of the\nmechanical philosophy. Yet, while as we have seen\n (section 3),\n Hume certainly saw it as part of the road to \u201ctrue\nphilosophy\u201d, he does not view Newton\u2019s achievement as a\ndecisive advance in knowledge of nature but, instead, as decisive\nevidence for the claim that nature will remain unknowable in\nprinciple. Hume understands Newton\u2019s success as a double-edged\nsword: even if Newton removed a source of error and/or enlarged our\nknowledge, he did so at the cost of undermining any hope of\nestablishing what we might call a \u201cfinal theory\u201d (see the\n entry on physicalism).\n Moreover, it is by no means clear whether Hume is willing to accept\nNewtonian natural philosophy as a form of knowledge. A natural reading\nof the passage is to conclude that Hume views Newton as successfully\n(to use an anachronistic term) falsifying the mechanists\u2019\nprogram, while Hume hedges his bets on offering any evaluation of the\npositive side of Newton\u2019s system (notice also the grudging use\nof \u201cseemed\u201d).\n\nThe way to make sense of Hume\u2019s remarks in The History of\nEngland is that they reveal that he implicitly accepts the\nMechanists\u2019 insistence\u2014explicitly associated with\nBoyle\u2014that theirs was the only program that offered the\npossibility of intelligible explanation (even if in the hands of many\nof its practitioners it only offered hope of post-facto rational\nreconstruction; see also Hume on Causation in\n section 4.4).\n Hume\u2019s treatment of Boyle reveals that he thought it was a good\nthing Newton falsified the mechanical philosophy. Hume acknowledges\nthat the mechanical philosophy could offer some successful\nexplanations. But he emphasizes that its practitioners were likely to\noverestimate\u2014on psychological and methodological\ngrounds\u2014its potential. Hume appears to have assimilated\nNewton\u2019s devastating criticisms of the mechanical\nphilosophy.\n\nFurthermore, the passage in The History of England, lends\nsupport for a skeptical interpretation of Hume\u2019s philosophy.\nHume thinks the Newtonian project will enable some knowledge of nature\nat the cost of keeping a \u201cfinal theory\u201d permanently\nunavailable to human inquiry. Earlier Hume had offered a positive\naccount of the explanatory principles knowable to mankind: \n\n\nElasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts, communication of motion by\nimpulse; these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which\nwe shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem ourselves\nsufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and reasoning, we can\ntrace up the particular phenomena to, or near to, these general\nprinciples. (EHU 4.1.12) \n\n\nLet\u2019s leave aside, for the moment, the ultimate metaphysical\nstatus of \u201cultimate causes and principles\u201d in Hume\u2019s\nthought. He is willing to accept that some limited set of fundamental\nscientific laws (i.e., \u201cultimate causes and principles\u201d)\nare available to human researchers. (Hume hedges his bets a bit; note\nhis use of \u201cprobably\u201d.) Moreover, these four principles\nare all associated with Newton\u2019s project; the mechanical\nphilosophy had only accepted communication of motion by impulse as an\nexplanatory principle. Of course, Hume treats these laws not so much\nas describing genuine \u201ccauses\u201d or \u201cpowers\u201d of\nnature, but rather\u2014in opposition to Newton\u2019s own view\nwhich insisted on the reality and causal nature of forces (Janiak\n2007)\u2014as a way to keep track of the appearances (recall\n section 3\n above).\n\nFinally, these passages show that Hume rules out that we could ever\nhope to explain the causes of these laws (or unify them in some more\nultimate principle). Newton would agree he did not know the cause of\nthese laws (\u201cGeneral Scholium\u201d, Principia), but\nhe would treat it as a question open to further research and\nspeculation. In the context of a discussion of the doctrine of\noccasionalism, Hume shows he is aware of this: \n\n\nSir Isaac Newton (tho\u2019 some of his Followers have taken a\ndifferent Turn of thinking) plainly rejects it, but substituting the\nHypothesis of an Aetheral Fluid, not the immediate Volition of the\nDeity, as the Cause of Attraction. (\u201cA Letter From a Gentleman\nto his Friend in Edinburgh\u201d, THN p. 429) \n\n\nThis quote is revealing in two more ways: besides showing that Hume\nmay have been aware of some of Newton\u2019s attempts at articulating\na mechanism for the operation of attraction (i.e., Newton\u2019s\nletters to Bentley or Boyle; see Newton 2004), Hume recognizes that\nNewton\u2019s followers can deviate from Newton (recall\n section 3).\n\nIn light of the text of The History of England (VI, 542)\nquoted at the start of this sub-section, it is clear Hume thinks that\nNewton\u2019s laws are not sufficient for explaining all of nature.\nSo without (yet) taking a stance on how to interpret Hume\u2019s\ntreatment of induction or his account of causation, one can\ndistinguish two further strands of Hume\u2019s skepticism: i) Hume\ntreats Newton as showing conclusively that the domain of possible\nknowledge will leave parts of nature unknown forever; ii) in\nparticular, this will include the cause(s) behind our fundamental\nprinciples. The combination of (i\u2013ii) entails that Newtonian\nnatural theology\u2014a very popular eighteenth century intellectual\nenterprise (see the\n entry on natural theology and natural religion)\u2014is\n based on shaky foundations.\n\nTogether with Hume\u2019s emphasis on accounting for the phenomena in\nhis interpretation of Newtonian philosophy, Hume is far removed from\nNewton\u2019s realist ontology of interacting forces (Janiak 2007;\nSmeenk & Schliesser 2013). Two further sources for this difference\nare revealed when we analyze Hume\u2019s departure from\nNewton\u2019s account of causation\n (\u00a74.4)\n and Newton\u2019s rules of reasoning\n (\u00a74.5).\n",
