    "main_text": "Formal Models || Multi-Level Evolution\n2.4 Meaning\n\nFull descriptive accounts of truth and justification both demand a\ntheory of meaning. Until a sign has meaning, it cannot be true or\nfalse. Moreover, determining the meaning of justificatory claims may\nprovide a descriptive theory of justification. Presumably, what makes\na claim of justification true is the basis of that justification. If\nmeaning is conventional, then the evolution of meaning becomes an\ninstance of the evolution of conventions. \n\nModels of the evolution of conventions have in one case been extended\nto apply to meaning conventions. Skyrms (1996, chapter 5) gave an\nevolutionary interpretation of David Lewis\u2019 (1969) model\nof rational selection of meaning conventions. Skyrms was able to show\nthat there is strong selection on the formation of \u201csignaling\nsystems\u201d in mixed populations with a full set of coordinated,\ncountercoordinated, and uncoordinated strategies. It is significant\nthat the structure of the model and the selective process by which\nmeaning conventions emerge and are stabilized largely parallels the\naccount of the evolution of meaning given by Ruth Millikan (1984).\n\nIn the simplest version, the model is constructed as follows: We\nimagine that there are two states of affairs \\(T\\), two acts \\(A\\),\nand two signals \\(M\\). Players have an equal chance of being in either\nthe position of sender, or receiver. Receivers must decide what to do\nbased purely on what the sender tells them. In this purely cooperative\nversion, each player gets one point if the receiver does \\(A_1\\) if\nthe state is \\(T_1\\) or \\(A_2\\) if the state is \\(T_2\\).\n\nSince players will be both sender and receiver, they must have a\nstrategy for each situation. There are sixteen such strategies, and we\nsuppose them to be either inherited (or learned) from biological\nparents, or imitated on the basis of perceived success in terms of\npoints earned. Strategies \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) are signaling systems,\nin that if both players play the same one of these two strategies they\nwill always get their payoff. \\(I_3\\) and \\(I_4\\) are anti-signaling\nstrategies, which result in consistent miscoordination, though they do\nwell against each other. All of the other strategies involve \\(S_3,\nS_4, R_3\\), or \\(R_4\\), which results in the same act being performed\nno matter what the external state is.\n\n\n\nSender Strategies\n\n\\(S_1\\)\nSend \\(M_1\\) if \\(T_1\\); \\(M_2\\) if \\(T_2\\) \n\n\\(S_2\\)\nSend \\(M_2\\) if \\(T_1\\); \\(M_1\\) if \\(T_2\\) \n\n\\(S_3\\)\nSend \\(M_1\\) if \\(T_1\\) or \\(T_2\\) \n\n\\(S_4\\)\nSend \\(M_2\\) if \\(T_1\\) or \\(T_2\\) \n\n\n\n\n\nReceiver Strategies\n\n\\(R_1\\)\nDo \\(A_1\\) if \\(M_1\\); \\(A_2\\) if \\(M_2\\) \n\n\\(R_2\\)\nDo \\(A_2\\) if \\(M_1\\); \\(A_1\\) if \\(M_2\\) \n\n\\(R_3\\)\nDo \\(A_1\\) for \\(M_1\\) or \\(M_2\\) \n\n\\(R_4\\)\nDo \\(A_2\\) for \\(M_1\\) or \\(M_2\\) \n\n\n\n\nComplete\nStrategies\n\n\\(I_1\\):\n\\(S_1,R_1\\)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\\(I_9\\):\n\\(S_3,R_1\\) \n\n\\(I_2\\):\n\\(S_2,R_2\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{10}\\):\n\\(S_3,R_2\\) \n\n\\(I_3\\):\n\\(S_1,R_2\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{11}\\):\n\\(S_3,R_3\\) \n\n\\(I_4\\):\n\\(S_2,R_1\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{12}\\):\n\\(S_3,R_4\\) \n\n\\(I_5\\):\n\\(S_1,R_3\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{13}\\):\n\\(S_4,R_1\\) \n\n\\(I_6\\):\n\\(S_2,R_3\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{14}\\):\n\\(S_4,R_2\\) \n\n\\(I_7\\):\n\\(S_1,R_4\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{15}\\):\n\\(S_4,R_3\\) \n\n\\(I_8\\):\n\\(S_2,R_4\\)\n\u00a0\n\\(I_{16}\\):\n\\(S_4,R_4\\) \n\n\nSimulation results showed that virtually all initial population\ndistributions become dominated by one or the other of the two\nsignaling system strategies. The situation becomes more complex when\nmore realistic payoffs are introduced, for instance, that the sender\nincurs a cost rather than automatically sharing the benefit that the\nreceiver gets from correct behavior for the environment. Even in such\nsituations, however, the most likely course of evolution is domination\nby a signaling system. \n",
