    "main_text": "Skepticism about Needs and Common Response Strategies || The Undesirability of Distribution According to Need\n2.2 The Undesirability of Distribution According to Need\n\n\nNeeds as grounds of distribution might be attacked by those who are\nkeen to promote the virtues of self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and\nsocial independence. Rather than demanding of others that they should\nmeet our needs, an objector might maintain that we should transcend\nour neediness, associated as it is with weakness, frailty,\nvulnerability, and other pathetic parts of our nature. Attending to\nneed can be debilitating for both giver and receiver, on this line of\nobjection. On the giver\u2019s part, the demandingness of need is\nfelt to threaten her capacity to carry out her own plan of\nlife. Emerson gave vent to this thought:\n\n\n\nDo not tell me, as a good man did today, of my obligation to put all\npoor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee,\nthou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the\ncent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not\nbelong (Emerson 1901, 59).\n\n\nOn the receiver\u2019s side, being dependent on others to meet our\nneeds renders us subservient to them. Consider Adam Smith\u2019s\nremark:\n\n\n\nNothing tends so much to corrupt and enervate and debase the mind as\ndependency, and nothing gives such noble and generous notions of\nprobity as freedom and independence (Smith 1982 (originally\n1762\u20131763), 333).\n\n\nFor Smith, commercial exchange in a free market serves to prevent the\nnoted vices. Markets foster self-reliance, social independence, and\nexchange among equals, freeing us from relations of dominance,\nsubservience, and servility.\n\n\nIn addition, if the state is in the business of attending to\npeople\u2019s needs, this raises the spectre of a bureaucratic, nanny\nstate fostering one-sided dependence among citizens. The idea of\ndistribution according to need, it is said, invokes or lends itself to\na passive conception of agency. Those to whom goods are distributed\nwill be seen as recipients of the state\u2019s largesse. More\nworrisomely, the beneficiaries themselves may come to abandon the\nattempt to meet their own needs, as state policies promote a culture\nof dependence. This is destructive of people\u2019s own sense of\ntheir agency and empowerment, and destructive of the very ethos a good\nsociety should be promoting.  We should instead be encouraging people\nto take responsibility for their own well-being.\n2.2.1 Paternalism and Abuse\n\n\nCritics argue that using need as a criterion of distribution lends\nitself to paternalism, authoritarianism, or abuse. To ensure parity of\ntreatment, an outside agency must decide what needs different people\nhave. But it may seem instead that people should be allowed the\nfreedom to decide for themselves what their needs are, how they should\nmatter, and what weight should attach to them compared with other\nconsiderations that might subjectively seem more important. Griffin\ngives the example of a group of scholars having to choose between an\nextension to their library and exercise equipment to promote their\nhealth (Griffin 1986, 45). The latter can be construed as a need,\nwhereas the former is only an informed desire, since it depends on\naims that are peculiar to the scholarly community. Yet, Griffin\nargues, it would be odd to say that there is an obligation to provide\nthe equipment that the scholars value less in preference to the\nresource that they value more. As those whose wellbeing is at issue,\nthe scholars should be the ones to make judgements about how to weigh\ntheir needs with other core aspects of their wellbeing. \n\n\nIn short, distributing in accordance with needs allows too many\nopportunities for outsiders to get these matters wrong or to act\npaternalistically with regard to those they aim to assist.  It is best\nto have individuals be in charge of managing their needs in the\ncontexts of their own lives.\n2.2.2 Bottomless Pits\n\n\nHere the charge is that, once we think of needs as imposing\nobligations on us, there will be too many for us to satisfy. Some will\nbe especially demanding. Consider how many medical needs are in this\ncategory, such as needs for renal dialysis machines or needs\nassociated with organ transplantation. Even to attempt to meet all of\nthem would be excessively burdensome on those who are required to\nassist, whether as charity donors or taxpayers.\n\n\nThere are at least two kinds of concerns associated with this\n\u201cbottomless pit\u201d worry. Reflecting, for instance, on the\ncost of meeting medical needs within most high-income countries and\nthe fact that healthcare budgets are under significant pressures (even\nthough reasonably high proportions of public resources are allocated\nto healthcare), it seems that we cannot satisfy all the\nhealthcare needs that present themselves within our societies.  Given\nscientific and technical advances, there will be an indefinitely large\nnumber of possible new treatments to promote the quality of life and\nto prolong it. So since the healthcare budget is finite, and limited\nby competing demands on public funds, it seems that in this area needs\nare in principle insatiable: there will always be more that we might\ndo to fulfil them.\n\n\nThis in principle insatiability concern can easily transform into an\noverdemandingness concern if we extend the scope of the needs that we\nhave a responsibility to meet to other societies besides our own.\nConsider the vast number of people across the planet who have unmet\nneeds for healthcare alone, never mind all the other domains in which\ntheir needs go unfulfilled. One might easily conclude that if needs\nhave normative force, we will be overwhelmed by the apparent\nbottomless pits of needs that exist globally.\n",
