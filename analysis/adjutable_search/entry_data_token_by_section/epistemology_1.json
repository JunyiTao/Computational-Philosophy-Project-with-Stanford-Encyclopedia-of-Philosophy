    "main_text": "The Varieties of Cognitive Success || What Kinds of Things Enjoy Cognitive Success?\n1.1 What Kinds of Things Enjoy Cognitive Success?\n\nCognitive successes can differ from each other by virtue of qualifying\ndifferent kinds of things. For instance, a cognitive\nsuccess\u2014like that of making a discovery\u2014may be the success\nof a person (e.g., Marie Curie), or of a laboratory (Los Alamos), or\nof a people (the Hopi), or even, perhaps, of a psychological fragment\nof a person (the unconscious). But some kinds of cognitive\nsuccess\u2014like that of having successfully cultivated a highly\ndiscriminating palate, say\u2014may be the success of a person, and\nperhaps even of a people, but cannot be the success of a laboratory or\nof a psychological fragment. And other kinds of cognitive\nsuccess\u2014like that of being conclusively established by all the\navailable evidence\u2014may be the success of a theory, but cannot be\nthe success of a person\u2014or like that of being epistemically\nfruitful\u2014may be the success of a research program, or of a\nparticular proof-strategy, but not of a theory. Indeed, there is a\nvast range of things, spanning different metaphysical categories, that\ncan enjoy one or another kind of cognitive success: we can evaluate\nthe cognitive success of a mental state (such as that of believing a\nparticular proposition) or of an act (such as that of drawing a\nparticular conclusion), or of a procedure (such as a particular\nprocedure for revising degrees of confidence in response to evidence,\nor a particular procedure for acquiring new evidence), or of a\nrelation (such as the mathematical relation between an agent\u2019s\ncredence function in one evidential state and her credence function in\nanother evidential state, or the relation of trust between one person\nand another).\n\nSome of the recent controversies concerning the objects of cognitive\nsuccess concern the metaphysical relations among the cognitive\nsuccesses of various kinds of objects: Does the cognitive success of a\nprocess involve anything over and above the cognitive success of each\nstate in the succession of states that comprise the execution of that\n process?[2]\n Does the cognitive success of a particular mental state, or of a\nparticular mental act, depend upon its relation to the larger process\nin which it\n exists?[3]\n Is the cognitive success of an organization constituted merely by the\ncognitive successes of its members, or is it something over and above\nthose individual\n successes?[4]\n Is the cognitive success of a doxastic agent completely explicable in\nterms of the successes of its doxastic states, or vice versa?\nAnd either way, what sorts of doxastic states are there, and with\nrespect to what kinds of possible success are they assessible? The\nlatter dispute is especially active in recent years, with some\nepistemologists regarding beliefs as metaphysically reducible to high\n credences,[5]\n while others regard credences as metaphysically reducible to beliefs\nabout probabilities (see Byrne in Brewer & Byrne 2005), and still\nothers regard beliefs and credences as related but distinct phenomena\n(see Kaplan 1996, Neta 2008). \n\nOther recent controversies concern the issue of whether it is a\nmetaphysically fundamental feature of the objects of\ncognitive success that they are, in some sense, supposed to enjoy the\nkind of cognitive success in question. For instance, we might think\nthat what it is for some group of people to constitute a\nlaboratory is that the group is, in some sense,\nsupposed to make discoveries of a certain kind: that is the\npoint of bringing that group into collaboration in a particular way,\neven if the individuals are spread out across different continents and\ntheir funding sources diverse. But even if a laboratory is plausibly\ncharacterized by a norm to which it is answerable, is something\nanalogous true of the other objects that can enjoy cognitive success?\nIs it, for instance, a metaphysically fundamental feature of a belief\nthat it is, in some sense, supposed to be\n knowledge?[6]\n Or can belief be metaphysically characterized without appeal to this\nnorm? Is it, for instance, a metaphysically fundamental feature of a\nperson that such a creature is, in some sense, supposed to be\n rational?[7]\n Or can persons be metaphysically characterized without appeal to this\nnorm? Similar disputes arise for the other objects of cognitive\nsuccess: to what extent can we understand what these objects are\nwithout appeal to the kinds of success that they are supposed to\nenjoy?\n\nIn speaking, as we have just now, of the kinds of success that objects\nare \u201csupposed\u201d to enjoy, we have left it open in what\nsense the objects of cognitive success are \u201csupposed\u201d to\nenjoy their success: is it that their enjoyment of that success is\ngood? (If so, then how is it good?) Or is it rather that their\nenjoyment of that success is required? (If so, then what requires it,\nand why?) We turn to that general topic next.\n",
