    "main_text": "Identity and Applied Ethics || Advanced Directives\n6.2 Advanced Directives \n\n\nThe philosophical puzzle regarding advance directives is \nfundamentally a puzzle about personal identity. Suppose that a woman \nis in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, and she recognizes \nthat there will come a point where she is in a demented state and \nwill thus be incompetent to make autonomous or informed decisions \nabout her treatment. Because she values her creativity and autonomy, \nshe does not want that future demented self to be kept alive \u2013 \nits life will not be worth living \u2013 so she signs an advance \ndirective stipulating that no life-saving measures are to be used on \nthat future demented self (FDS). However, by the time her FDS gets \npneumonia, she is quite content in her state and, when asked, says \nshe wants to live (e.g., McMahan 2002, 497).\n\n\nThere is obviously a conflict here, but of what sort? If FDS is \nidentical to the early-stage Alzheimer's self (EAS), then the \nconflict is between temporally distinct interests of the same person.\nBut if that is the case, then we typically discount past interests in\nfavor of present ones. If, when I was a ravenously carnivorous \n20-year-old, I swore to myself that I would never pass up an \nopportunity to eat a juicy steak, yet I now find myself a vegetarian \nwho gets queasy at the sight of medium-rare flesh on the table, it is\nobviously my present interests that will \u2013 and ought, we think \n\u2013 win the day.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if FDS is not identical to EAS \u2013 \nif, instead, she is a different person, or is at least a different \nself \u2013 then it may not be so obvious what the conflict is after\nall, for FDS has made her preferences clear, and if she is \nimportantly distinct from the signer of the advance directive, then \nthere seems little reason why the interests of EAS are relevant at \nall to FDS's life. But then again, FDS is not competent, and EAS, if \nnot identical to her, is at least akin to her closest relative, one \nmight think, in which case her earlier wishes perhaps ought to hold \nsway after all (see Luttrell and Sommerville 1996). (But EAS and FDS \nwill be very psychologically different, we are supposing, so why \nthink they are closely related at all? Indeed, wouldn't FDS be more \nclosely \u201crelated\u201d to her fellow end-stage Alzheimer's \npatients? So why think EAS has any more right to make life-or-death \ndecisions about her than any of these others?)\n\n\nAnd here is yet another way of looking at the matter. Suppose we \nagree with Parfit and others that identity just is not what matters \nfor, among other things, defining and delimiting the scope of \negoistic concern; suppose instead it is Relation R. FDS, because of \nher loss of memory and the like, will bear a very limited degree of \nthat relation to EAS. EAS will thus be strongly R-related with most \nof the previous stages of her life (the chains of connectedness, let \nus stipulate, are very strong), but very weakly R-related with FDS, \neven though, it seems clear, FDS remains a stage of her life. But the\npart of her life most deeply prudentially unified \u2013 the far \nlarger, more dominant part of her life \u2013 is the part of which \nEAS was still a strongly R-related part. Thus it might be that the \nwishes of EAS to preserve a coherently meaningful and valuable life \nought to control here, given that the longer FDS lives, the worse she\nmight retrospectively render EAS's life. That is, what is good for \nthe deepest, longest prudential unity will be closest to what is best\nfor the life as a whole, so FDS's good ought to be sacrificed for the\nsake of the good of the whole, as articulated by EAS in her advanced \ndirective (see McMahan 2002, 502 for an argument like this).\n\n\nOf course, once we abandon identity as what matters \u2013 \nespecially if we do so in favor of a relation(s) that does not \nguarantee life-long unity (e.g., connectedness) \u2013 then it is \nnot so clear anymore why what is best for the life-as-a-whole \n\u201cunit\u201d should matter at all. But if considerations of \nlife-long welfare are set aside, then it is hard to see how EAS's \nadvance directive could still have any moral authority over FDS's \nexpressed interests. EAS's \u201clife\u201d would be over, for all \nintents and purposes, so it seems that no matter what happens to FDS,\nit cannot retroactively affect the value of EAS's already-completed \n\u201clife.\u201d This is the kind of move urged by some theorists \nregardless of considerations of identity. What we should abandon, \nthey suggest, is the intuition that EAS's preferences are \nauthoritative over FDS's at all (Dresser 1986, Jaworska 1999). Many \ndemented patients are still capable of a kind of autonomy \u2013 \ninvolving the capacity to value \u2013 and so their wishes \nought to be respected, goes this line, over the decisions of their \nearlier selves (Jaworska 1999, 109). Of course, this kind of view \nwon't apply to end-stage dementia patients, but they may be \npatients incapable of expressing (or having?) genuine preferences in \nthe first place.\n\n\nAs should be evident from just this very brief discussion, the issues\nhere are quite complex, but they are definitely issues for which\nconsiderations of personal identity are often taken to be directly\nrelevant.  (See also Buchanan 1988 for helpful discussion of some of\nthese issues.)\n",
