    "main_text": "Brownian Motion || Further Dimensions of Perrin's Case\n6.2 Further Dimensions of Perrin's Case\n\n\nThere were yet further dimensions to Perrin's experiments. In his 1905\npaper, Einstein had derived expressions for the mean displacement and\nrotation of Brownian particles as a function of time on the basis of\nthe kinetic theory. Perrin was able to show how these predictions were\nborne out by his observations of the particles. He, in effect, showed\nthat propositions basic to the kinetic theory, such as the\nindependence of orthogonal components of the velocity of particles and\nthe equi-partition of energy amongst their degrees of freedom, were\nsatisfied by the Brownian particles. What is more, it was again\npossible to calculate values for N from the experimentally\ndetermined mean displacements and rotations, and in both cases the\nmeasured values were within a few percent of 68 \u00d7\n1022.\n\n\nIt was not long before Avogadro's number could be calculated by\nmethods not closely tied to the kinetic theory of gases. Rayleigh\nspeculated that the brightness of the sky is due to the scattering of\nlight from the sun by molecules in the atmosphere. The theory\npredicted that light of shorter wavelength is scattered more\neffectively than that of longer wavelength, a prediction borne out by\nthe blueness of the sky and the redness of sunsets. It also predicted\nthat the scattered light be polarised, also in conformity with\nobservation. It was possible to calculate Avogadro's number from the\nratio of the intensity of skylight to that of light coming direct from\nthe sun. Once the charge on the electron had been measured it was also\npossible to calculate Avogadro's number from the relation between\ncurrent passed and weight of substance deposited in\nelectrolysis. Radioactivity was to provide further access to the\nnumber. In all cases, the values for Avogadro's number agreed to a\ndegree that could be reconciled with the accuracy of the experiments\nand the degree of approximation involved in the calculations.\n\n\nThere is a further important aspect of the extent to which Perrin's\nexperiments supported the kinetic theory. One of the major objections\nraised by opponents of that theory was the fact that it implied that\nthe second law of thermodynamics is only statistically true. Perpetual\nmotion machines of the second kind become improbable rather than\nimpossible. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the constant\nlifting of Brownian particles against gravity refutes the unqualified\nversion of the second law. When a Brownian particle moves upwards then\nthe first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy, requires\nthat the potential energy gained by the particle must come from\nsomewhere. If it comes from the heat of the suspending liquid then\nthis is in contradiction to the second law. An opponent of the kinetic\ntheory and a defender of the literal truth of the second law is\nrequired to supply some alternative source of the energy. Needless to\nsay, no suitable alternative was forthcoming. Once the kinetic theory\nis assumed, the rising of a Brownian particle is understood as a\nthe result of a statistical fluctuation. What is more, the randomness and the\nsmallness of the scale on which the violations of the second law take\nplace ensures that it is not possible to employ the phenomenon to\nextract useful work.\n The force of Perrin's argument for the kinetic theory, and hence\nfor the reality of molecules, stems from the fact that his argument\nrequires only the central assumptions of the theory, the equipartition\nof energy and the randomness of molecular agitation, without requiring\nthe addition of auxiliary or simplifying assumptions. It is this fact\nthat made his calculations of Avogadro's number qualitatively distinct\nfrom, and more telling than, other estimates. Ostwald cited this as\nthe reason for his conversion to belief in molecules (Nye, 1972,\n151\u2013152). Interestingly, the derivation of the ratio of the\nprinciple specific heats of a gas similarly requires only the basic\nassumptions of the kinetic theory cited above. That is why the clash\nof the prediction with measured values spelt serious trouble for the\nclassical kinetic theory. Equipartition of energy breaks down for the\nvibrational modes of a molecule and for rotational modes also at\ntemperatures sufficiently low, as Perrin (1990, 73) noted.\n\nSuggested Readings: Perrin (1990) is an English\ntranslation of his classic defence of atomism written in 1913. Nye\n(1972) is a useful historical survey of Perrin's work on Brownian\nmotion. A recent philosophical analysis of the significance of\nPerrin's experiments, which contains references to earlier analyses by\nother philosophers, is Achinstein (2001), 243\u2013265. Mayo (1996,\n214\u2013250) is an attempt to construe Perrin's argument as\ninvolving bottom-up rather than top-down reasoning. Doubts about the\nuse of Perrin's experiments by philosophers are raised by van Fraassen\n(2009), to which Chalmers (2011) is a response.\n",
