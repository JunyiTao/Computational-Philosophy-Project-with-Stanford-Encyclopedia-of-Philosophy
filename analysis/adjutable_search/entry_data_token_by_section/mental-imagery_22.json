    "main_text": "Mental imagery in art || Mental imagery in the visual arts\n5.1 Mental imagery in the visual arts\n\nA somewhat obvious way in which mental imagery plays a role in our\nengagement with visual arts follows from the simple fact that most\npictorial art does not normally encompass the entire visual field. So\nthose parts of the depicted scene that fall outside the frame, could\nbe, and very often are, represented by means of mental imagery. One\nfamous example would be Edgar Degas, who likes to place the\nprotagonists of his paintings in a way that only parts of them are\ninside the frame. The rest we need to complete by means of mental\nimagery. In some extreme cases (e.g., Dancers climbing the stairs,\n1886\u20131890, Musee D\u2019Orsay), we only see someone\u2019s arm\nor the top of their head and we need to complete those parts of her\nbody that are outside the frame by means of mental imagery. Another\nexample is Buster Keaton, who also uses the viewer\u2019s mental\nimagery of the off-screen space in his films, but normally for comical\neffects. One example is the first shot of his short film Cops\n(1922), where we see the protagonist in close up behind bars and\nlooking depressed. The second shot reveals that he is behind an iron\ngate talking to a girl who does not love him back (see Burch 1973, pp.\n17\u201331 for more examples of this kind).\n\nBut mental imagery is also often used within the picture frame. In the\n1950 American film Harvey, the character played by Jimmy\nStewart is an alcoholic and he hallucinates a six foot three and a\nhalf inch tall rabbit (or pooka). We don\u2019t see anyone, but the\nJimmy Stewart character clearly does. And, crucially, all the scenes\nwith the imaginary rabbit are framed as if there really were a rabbit\nin them. So when we see the Jimmy Stewart character in an armchair\nhaving a conversation with Harvey, this shot is framed in a way as if\nthere really were a six foot tall creature next to him. This framing\nis aesthetically relevant and its choice clearly relies on the\nviewer\u2019s mental imagery. In this example, we have a fairly good\nidea what we\u2019re supposed to form a mental imagery of \u2013 the\nJimmy Stewart character gives a fairly accurate description of\nHarvey\u2019s alleged appearance. But there are examples where we are\nin a much less fortunate epistemic situation. One classic example is\nBunuel\u2019s Belle de Jour, where the Chinese businessman\nshows a little box to the Cathrine Denevue character, who is clearly\nfascinated by what is inside. She sees it, he sees it, but we, the\nviewers don\u2019t. There is a humming voice coming from the box, but\nwe never see what is inside. We have a very indeterminate\n(crossmodally triggered) visual mental imagery of what could possibly\nbe in the box \u2013 whatever is in the box is left intentionally\nindeterminate. The French film director, Robert Bresson often uses\nmental imagery this way, so much so that he even takes this use of\nmental imagery to be the mark of a \u2018good\u2019 director (or, as\nhe would put it, of a cinematographer, not merely of a director):\n\u201cDon\u2019t show all sides of the object. A margin of\nindefiniteness\u201d (Bresson 1975/1977, p. 52).\n\nMultimodal mental imagery became a hallmark of 1960s European\nmodernist art films. In some of his films, Jean-Luc Godard used sound\nprimarily as a prompt for triggering visual mental imagery (see\nLevinson 2014\u2019s sensitive analysis of the use of sound in\nMasculin/Feminin (1966) from this point of view). And both\nBresson and Michelangelo Antonioni used sound this way for much of\ntheir career, and they were also very explicit about this way of using\nsound in their theoretical writings and interviews. As Bresson said,\n\u201cThe eye solicited alone makes the ear impatient, the ear\nsolicited alone makes the eye impatient. Use these impatiences\u201d\n(Bresson 1975/1977, p. 28) and \u201cA locomotive\u2019s whistle\nimprints on us a whole railroad station\u201d (Bresson 1975/1977, p.\n39). And here is Antonioni giving a textbook definition of multimodal\nmental imagery: \u201cWhen we hear something, we form images in our\nhead automatically in order to visualize what we hear\u201d\n(Antonioni 1982, p. 6). Both Bresson and Antonioni use multimodal\nmental imagery that is indeterminate and that is also very much\nemotionally laden. As a counterbalance to this high-brow overkill, it\nneeds to be emphasized that multimodal mental imagery can also be used\nin a very different manner and still be aesthetically relevant. As\nRidley Scott repeatedly emphasizes in his interviews about his\nAlien trilogy, the Alien is shown relatively rarely because\nhaving mental imagery of it is much scarier than seeing it. This\ngeneral credo has been used in suspense for a long time (from\nHitchcock films to Jaws). Finally, the recurring joke on\nFriends about the ugly naked guy who lives across the street\n(but whom we never see) clearly utilizes multimodal mental\nimagery.\n",
