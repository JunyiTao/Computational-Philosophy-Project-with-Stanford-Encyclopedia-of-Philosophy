The 20th Century and Beyond \n\nSome of the deepest criticisms of progress were produced during and\nafter the catastrophes and upheavals of the 20th century.  Theodor Adorno\n(1903\u20131969) wrote Minima Moralia, a collection of short\npieces, during World War II and its aftermath.  This work addresses a\nvariety of interlocking topics relating to fascism, capitalism, and\nthe war.  As a German and a Jew in exile, Adorno is concerned to\nconfront Nazism and the Holocaust.  Given his intellectual background\nas a scholar of Hegel and Marx, this confrontation takes the shape of\na critique of Hegel's philosophy of history.  Recall that Hegel\nclaims that a reflective individual who surveys the course of history\nwill be reconciled to tragedies when he understands their contribution\nto progress overall.  Adorno is viscerally repulsed by this notion.\nHe notes with indignation: \u201cMillions of Jews have been murdered,\nand this is to be seen as an interlude and not as the catastrophe\nitself\u201d (1951, 55).\n\n\nAdorno attacks Hegel from two directions.  First Adorno is simply\nskeptical that fascism and the Holocaust can be part of any upward\nhistorical trend (55\u20136).  Second, he points to a tension in\nHegel's own thought.  He notes that, in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit, Hegel advises \u201ctarrying with the negative\u201d\n(1807, \u00a732), which means giving the negative moments in\nhistory a full dose of philosophical attention.  However, Adorno says,\nin practice Hegel often moves past human evils and individual fates in\na cursory fashion (1951, 16\u201317), hurrying toward the stage of\nreconcilation.  Adorno proposes a new method of examining history for\nmeaning, exemplified by Minima Moralia, that dwells on\nindividual experience and catastrophe.  Theoretically, Adorno reverses\nHegel, asserting \u201cthe whole is the false\u201d (Adorno 1951,\n50).\n\n\nIn Minima Moralia, Adorno mentions that the writings of\nWalter Benjamin (1892\u20131940) are an inspiration to him.  In the \u201cTheses\non History,\u201d Benjamin offers a similar criticism of the Hegelian and\nMarxian philosophy of history.  The ninth thesis perhaps speaks for\nitself:\n\n\nA Klee painting named \u201cAngelus Novus\u201d shows an angel looking as though\nhe is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating.\nHis eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread.  This\nis how one pictures the angel of history.  His face is turned toward\nthe past.  Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single\ncatastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in\nfront of his feet.  The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and\nmake whole what has been smashed.  But a storm is blowing from\nParadise; it has caught in his wings with such violence that the angel\ncan no longer close them.  This storm irresistibly propels him into\nthe future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris\nbefore him grows skyward.  This storm is what we call\nprogress. (Benjamin 1941, 257\u20138)\n\n\nBenjamin reverses the Hegelian worldview poetically, just as Adorno\ndoes so theoretically.\n\n\nDecolonization presented a second occasion for rethinking the concept of\nprogress.  In the twenty years after World War II, the European powers relinquished \nthe vast majority of the non-European colonies still in their possession \n(Hunt et. al. 1995, 996\u201399). Scholars from the former European colonies, \nreflecting on the colonial past, have noted that European apologists for \ncolonialism claimed that it modernized the supposedly backward non-European world. \nIn other words, the apologists situated colonialism in a progress narrative. \nImplicitly or explicitly, postcolonial critics hold that this use of the concept \nof progress calls it into question.   \n\n\nBeyond this common core, the criticisms offered vary. For instance, Samir Amin's \nstudy  Eurocentrism  is concerned to criticize a particular conception \nof progress. This conception, which he terms Eurocentrism, characterizes all major \nhistorical innovations as European.  It also views capitalist democracy as the ideal\nsocial system and colonialism as instrumental in spreading it throughout the world \n(Amin 1988, 108). Finally, Eurocentricism holds that current global economic \ninequality is caused by internal features of individual countries (77) and is in \nprinciple eliminable (111). Now, Amin does not reject the project of identifying \nmacro-historical movements. His reasoning is, in fact, influenced by Marxism. \nHe seeks only to replace Eurocentrism with a truer account. To do so, he first \npresents an alternate sketch of historical development that shines light on \nnon-European contributions.  He next argues that current global inequality is\nproduced by international capitalism and cannot be eradicated without dismantling\nthat system (112\u201314).  He ends by stating that some form of socialism is the only \nstable and humane political system, although it is far from inevitable (152). \n\n\nPostmodern postcolonial theorists offer a more radical critique of\nEuropean progress narratives than Amin does.  Michel Foucault, the\nFrench historian of ideas, is a major influence on the school.\nFoucault holds that discourses are what constitute and empower the\nsubjects that make history.  Thus he takes discourses as the\nfundamental objects of historical study.  In Orientalism,\nEdward Said (1935\u20132003) applies Foucault's method of discourse\nanalysis to 18th-, 19th-, and 20th-century writings about the Middle\nEast by British and French novelists, travelers, and academics (Said\n1978, 201). At the heart of the discourse of Orientalism is the\nconviction that the countries of the Middle East lag behind those of\nEurope and can only improve under the tutelage of Europeans (172,\n205\u201306).  Said argues that the discourse of Orientalism laid the\nfoundation for the colonial project and supported it once it was\nunderway (210).  In addition to Said, the historians of the subaltern\nstudies movement have adapted a Foucauldian view of history, in their\ncase to analyze Indian colonial history (Prakash 1994, 1480).  They\nhave drawn attention to historical actors they term\n\u201csubaltern.\u201d These are non-elite Indians that challenged\nthe discourses of both colonialism and anti-British nationalism by\nexploiting inconsistencies in those discourses (1482\u20133).\nAlthough at odds in many ways, both discourses drew heavily from\nprogress narratives (1475).  In general, postmodern postcolonialists\naim to show that the typical universal history is one discourse among\nmany incommensurable discourses, none of which are without\ninconsistencies.\n\n\nSo far, we have seen how the events of the 20th century provoked\ncriticisms of the typical European progress narrative. In contrast,\nthe collapse of communism inspired a minor revival of the traditional\nprogress narrative.  In his 1989 article \u201cThe End of\nHistory?\u201d Francis Fukuyama proclaims: \u201cWhat we may be\nwitnessing is not just the end of the Cold War \u2026 but the end of\nhistory as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological\ndevelopment and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as\nthe final form of human government\u201d (1989, 3).  This article and\nits companion book, The End of History and the Last Man,\nendorse Hegelian social theory as Fukuyama interprets it.  For\nFukuyama, Hegel at once offers an idealist theory of social change and\nchampions liberal democracy.  Fukuyama argues that, according to\nHegel, history entered its final phase when the principles of liberal\ndemocracy first motivated a world historical event, namely the French\nRevolution (1992, xvii; 199).  After that crucial point, no more major\ndevelopments were in store, but instead the gradual spread and\nrealization of the liberal democratic ideal.\n\n\nOf course, this argument was seriously challenged by the rise of\nfascism and communism in the 20th century and the conflicts that\nensued.  But Fukuyama in 1989 was maximally situated to defend Hegel\nand to argue that these ideological alternatives to liberal democracy were\nessentially deviations from deeper trends.  According to Fukuyama,\nfascism clearly failed by the mid-century (16-17) and now, with the\nfall of the Soviet Union, it was evident that communism was also a\ndead end. Fukuyama states that the proximate cause of the Soviet regime's fall \nwas its lack of legitimacy with the governing elite (30\u20131). The elite lost faith in \nthe regime because they saw that it was ideologically bankrupt (31).\n\n\nAccording to Fukuyama, liberalism's great ideological rivals\nfailed in the long term for two reasons.  First of all, communism has the \nwrong theory of economic management (40, 93\u201395), and could not provide long-term\neconomic prosperity (28\u201329).  Thus Marx's claim that capitalism\nwas materially unstable proved true of communism instead.  Second,\nfollowing Hegel, Fukuyama asserts that only liberalism can satisfy the\nhuman desire for recognition in a stable fashion.\n\n\nFukuyama ends his book with an intriguing consideration of\nHegel's view of war. Fukuyama agrees with Hegel that liberal\ndemocracy's greatest weakness is its tendency to produce selfish\nand effete bourgeois types.  But he points out that war\u2014at least\nmodern war\u2014is destructive rather than invigorating (1992, 335).\nHe asserts that World War I was caused partly by widespread\nrestlessness (331\u2013332), but its result was to devastate rather than\nre-energize Europe (335).  It may be that those who wish to abolish\nwar are naive, but Fukuyama argues persuasively that Hegel's\nview of war is equally naive.\n\n\nUnlike Fukuyama, John Rawls (1921\u20132002) never argues that the liberal\ndemocratic ideal is the necessary endpoint of historical development.\nInstead, Rawls's first priority is the justification of a particular\nconception of liberal justice, one that supports basic political and\ncivil freedoms, and also dictates significant economic redistribution.\nAt the same time, influenced by Kant and Hegel (2000, 330), Rawls is\nconcerned to show that the ideal he describes is possible (1996,\nxx). By this, he means that it is reachable from the present and, once\nattained, capable of lasting \u201cin perpetuity\u201d (1971, 131;\n1996, 18).  He also intends for his demonstration of a just\nsociety's possibility to increase its probability: he claims\nthat the Weimar Republic disintegrated into Nazism because its main\nplayers lost faith in the idea of a pluralistic society (1996,\nlxi\u2013lxii).\n\n\nRawls defines a \u201cwell-ordered society\u201d (1971, 4) as a just\nsociety whose members understand, endorse, and act from the principles\nof justice, and moreover are aware of each other's attitudes.  A\nwell-ordered society is \u201cstable\u201d (1971, 455) if its just\ninstitutions nurture rather than thwart the appropriate attitudes in\nits members.  Thus a stable well-ordered society is one whose\ninstitutions are reproduced over time by informed, morally motivated\ncitizens. Part III of A Theory of Justice argues that a\nsociety satisfying Rawlsian liberal principles of justice will be\nstable.\n\n\nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls yokes the question of the\npersistence of a liberal society to the question of its emergence.\nRawls draws on familiar historical events to illustrate how his ideal\nsociety could emerge.  He notes that freedom of religion started as a\n\u201cmodus vivendi\u201d (1996, xli), or practical solution, to the\nwars of religion between Catholics and Protestants.  Both groups\nagreed to the solution because they were exhausted by the fighting,\nnot because they endorsed freedom of religion for its own sake.  Yet\nover time Europeans came to endorse freedom of religion on deeper\ngrounds than their immediate self-interest (xxv-xxvii).\n\n\nRawls thinks that political liberalism extends freedom of religion to\nmoral worldviews in general. Thus he hopes that an analogous path could lead to \nthe emergence of a well-ordered society. Individuals could first choose \nprinciples of justice as compromises to persistent moral disagreements, and over \ntime come to endorse such principles for their own sake.  Respectful public \ndebate\u2014what Rawls calls the use of \u201cpublic reason\u201d (1996,\n213)\u2014will aid the transformation (1996, 165\u201367).  Over time a\nsociety of many competing worldviews\u2014or \u201creasonable\ncomprehensive doctrines\u201d\u2014can come to an \u201coverlapping\nconsensus\u201d on principles of justice governing the public sphere\n(1996, 134).  Other remarks suggest a different path to the same\nsituation.  Here Rawls suggests that his theory is an immanent working\nout of ideas already \u201cembedded in our public life\u201d (1980,\n307). This ideological connection to the present should at least\nfacilitate the emergence of a more just society.  In this way, Rawls\ncombines optimism and realism, rejecting the doctrine of progress but\nemphasizing the possibility of lasting improvement.\n\n\nIn contrast to Rawls' basic optimism, environmentalists have recently\nproduced some of the most alarming criticisms of the idea of progress.\nJared Diamond and Ronald Wright are examples.  The authors share three\nbasic theoretical commitments.  First, they point to the natural\nenvironment as the most important determinant of long-term social\nstability and change.  Next, they appeal to historical examples to\nargue that change is non-linear and that environmental variables\nexplain the non-linearity.  Then, extrapolating from past collapses,\nthey argue that recent growth rates should not encourage optimism.\nInstead, global collapse is a real possibility.\n\n\nDiamond's first book, Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997),\nbegins with the Columbian encounter.  Diamond asks why the Europeans\nconquered the Americans, rather than the other way around.  Assuming\nthat the answer lies with Europe's technological advantage over\nthe Americas, Diamond arrives at a second question.  Why, in the late\n15th and early 16th centuries, did the Europeans have this advantage\n(1997, 15)? If all pre-historic peoples began roughly at the same\nstarting point, this question implies a third: Why did pre-Columbian\nrates of development vary so much worldwide (16)?  Appealing to recent\nresearch in scientific anthropology, Diamond argues that environmental\nvariation satisfactorily accounts for the corresponding social and\ntechnological variation.  Diamond defends the thesis that features of\nthe natural environment, and the technology they directly enable, are\nthe driving forces of long-run development (1997, 87).\n\n Wright's A Short History of Progress (2004) also\nargues for the primacy of environmental variables, but shifts the\nfocus away from differential rates of development. Wright states that\nwhat is truly surprising is the similarity among developmental paths\nin areas isolated from one another (2004, 50).  In both Europe and the\nAmericas, we see a movement from illiterate, egalitarian\nhunter-gatherer societies to complex and hierarchical\nagriculturally-based ones.  At the time of their confrontation, the\nworlds of the Spanish and the Aztecs were more alike than they were\ndifferent.  Wright takes the similarity as strong evidence that\nuniversal environmental features and human needs drive development\n(51).\n\n\nThe trajectory from simplicity to complexity appears linear.  But\nWright and Diamond argue that appearances are misleading.  Looking\nclosely at human history, we see many instances of collapse.\nUnderstanding the cause of circumscribed collapses in the past will\nfoster healthy skepticism about where the human race as a whole is\nheaded.  Wright looks at failed societies such as the kingdom of Ur,\nAncient Maya and Rome, and Easter Island.  Diamond's second\nbook, Collapse (2005), considers some of the same failures.\nFailures occur when societies enter a progress trap (Wright 2004, 5).\nA progress trap is a practice that drives environmentally\nunsustainable growth and is difficult to halt once it is in motion.\nAlthough this definition of the term \u2018progress trap\u2019 is due to\nWright, Diamond studies essentially the same phenomenon and traces\nthe process in greater detail than Wright does.\n\nAssume the growth of a society is determined by its ability to exploit\nthe natural resources that it possesses.  Assume that it will exploit\nthem to its full potential.  As the society grows, its ability to\nexploit its environment increases, which in turn causes it to develop\nfurther.  Growth is not constant but accelerating.  The society grows\nexactly up to the point at which its resources are depleted.  At that\nmoment, the rate of development and the level of development are at a\nmaximum.  Immediately afterwards, with the material foundation of\nsociety gone, a dramatic collapse occurs.  Not only does past growth\nnot mean future growth, the trajectory is virtually discontinuous at\nthe moment of collapse.\n\n\nThis trajectory presupposes that the society makes no attempt to renew\nthe resources on which it depends.  Diamond isolates factors that\nexplain the blindness, one especially important one being the\nadherence to dysfunctional value systems (432\u2013434).  Wright speaks of\n\u201csticking to entrenched beliefs and practices [and] robbing the future\nto pay the present\u201d (2004, 79). For Diamond, the factors are\nchangeable by individual and collective acts of will.  Unlike Wright,\nDiamond documents successes as well as failures: societies that\nrecognized and altered their unsustainable practices before it was too\nlate.  Historical examples of these include Tokugawa, Japan (2005,\n294\u2013306), and Tikopia, an island in the South Pacific (2005, 286\u201393).\nThese societies were flexible and farsighted where unsuccessful ones\nwere rigid and focused on the present.\n\n\nWright and Diamond see various aspects of the present as dangerous,\nincluding the growth of population and pollution (Wright 2002, 128),\nand the depletion of crucial resources (Diamond 2005, 487\u2013490).  These\nare the features of a civilization immediately before a\ncollapse. Wright (2004, 64) and Diamond (2005, 118\u2013119) suggest that\nincreasing interconnectedness means that the globe will succeed as a\nwhole or fail as a whole. But, ultimately, neither author is a\ncomplete environmental determinist or a complete pessimist.  Diamond\nsuggests that same kind of collective rationality that has prevented\nsmall-scale collapse can prevent global collapse (2005, 522).  Unlike\nDiamond, Wright is not detailed in his recommendations for change and\nhis vision of a truly sustainable globe remains murky.  But he too\nthinks that in the next 100 years, individual and group choices will\ndetermine whether or not collapse occurs (2004, 130\u2013132).\n\n\nThe idea of progress is complex enough that it has attracted many\ntypes of criticism, and some of them seem especially hard to refute.\nFor one thing, the determinism inherent in the idea of progress is\ndifficult to maintain.  It is telling that many of the theorists do\nnot incorporate their act of writing and the reception they hope for\ninto a deterministic framework.  Second, whether we agree with the\nprecise claims made by Diamond and Wright, it is now clear that\nnatural limits on growth exist. The exact limits cannot be known for\ncertain unless they are reached.  But rather than proceeding as if no\nenvironmental limits exist, it is more prudent to estimate the limits\nand develop policy accordingly.  It is better to slow down and come to\na halt a few feet before a brick wall than to ignore it and slam into\nit.\n\n\nFor those who reject the idea of progress for these or other reasons,\nwhy care about theories of progress? Not all components of the\nwritings on progress are equally problematic. Three seem especially\nworthwhile. First, theories of progress draw attention to the power of the \nWestern scientific paradigm.  Next, some theorists of progress formulate plausible\nnormative standards for individual domains of human life.  Last, the\nwritings on progress contain some of the most powerful statements of\nthe Enlightenment ideals of freedom, equality, and cosmopolitan\njustice.\n\n",
