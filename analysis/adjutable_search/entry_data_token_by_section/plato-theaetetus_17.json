The story now on\noffer says explicitly that perception relates to thought roughly as\nHumean \u201cimpressions\u201d relate to Humean \u201cideas\u201d\n(191d; compare Hume, First Enquiry II). The objects of\nperception, as before, are a succession of constantly-changing\nimmediate awarenesses.  The objects of thought, it is now added, are\nthose objects of perception to which we have chosen to give a measure\nof stability by imprinting them on the wax tablets in our minds. (The\nimage of memory as writing in the mind had currency in Greek thought\nwell before Plato\u2019s time: see e.g. Aeschylus, Eumenides\n275.)\n\n\nThis new spelling-out of the empiricist account of thought seems to\noffer new resources for explaining the possibility of false\nbelief. The new explanation can say that false belief occurs when\nthere is a mismatch, not between two objects of thought, nor\nbetween two objects of perception, but between one object of\neach type.\n\n\nThis proposal faces a simple and decisive objection. No one disputes\nthat there are false beliefs that cannot be explained as\nmismatches of thought and perception: e.g., false beliefs about\narithmetic. The Wax Tablet does not explain how such false beliefs\nhappen; indeed it entails that they can\u2019t happen. Such\nmistakes are confusions of two objects of thought, and the Wax Tablet\nmodel does not dispute the earlier finding that there can be no such\nconfusions. So the Wax Tablet model fails.\n\n\nThere is of course plenty more that Plato could have said in\ncriticism of the Wax Tablet model. Most obviously, he could have\npointed out the absurdity of identifying any number with any\nindividual\u2019s thought of that number (195e9 ff.); especially\nwhen the numerical thought in question is no more than an ossified\nperception. In the present passage Plato is content to refute the Wax\nTablet by the simplest and shortest argument available: so he does not\nmake this point. But perhaps the point is meant to occur to the\nreader; for the same absurdity reappears in an even more glaring form\nin the Aviary passage.\n",
