    "main_text": "Some Questions about Emerson || Early and Late Emerson\n4.2 Early and Late Emerson\n\nIt is hard for an attentive reader not to feel that there are\nimportant differences between early and late Emerson: for example,\nbetween the buoyant Nature (1836) and the weary ending of\n\u201cExperience\u201d (1844); between the expansive author of\n\u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d (1841) and the burdened writer of\n\u201cFate\u201d (1860). Emerson himself seems to advert to such\ndifferences when he writes in \u201cFate\u201d: \u201cOnce we\nthought, positive power was all. Now we learn that negative power, or\ncircumstance, is half\u201d (CW6: 8). Is \u201cFate\u201d the\nrecord of a lesson Emerson had not absorbed in his early writing,\nconcerning the multiple ways in which circumstances over which we have\nno control \u2014 plagues, hurricanes, temperament, sexuality, old\nage \u2014 constrain self-reliance or self-development?\n\n\u201cExperience\u201d is a key transitional essay. \u201cWhere do\nwe find ourselves?\u201d is the question with which it begins. The\nanswer is not a happy one, for Emerson finds that we occupy a place of\ndislocation and obscurity, where \u201csleep lingers all our lifetime\nabout our eyes, as night hovers all day in the boughs of the\nfir-tree\u201d (CW3: 27). An event hovering over the essay, but not\ndisclosed until its third paragraph, is the death of his five-year old\nson Waldo. Emerson finds in this episode and his reaction to it an\nexample of an \u201cunhandsome\u201d general character of\nexistence-it is forever slipping away from us, like his little\nboy.\n\n\u201cExperience\u201d presents many moods. It has its moments of\nillumination, and its considered judgment that there is an\n\u201cIdeal journeying always with us, the heaven without rent or\nseam\u201d (CW3: 41). It offers wise counsel about \u201cskating\nover the surfaces of life\u201d and confining our existence to the\n\u201cmid-world.\u201d But even its upbeat ending takes place in a\nsetting of substantial \u201cdefeat.\u201d \u201cUp again, old\nheart!\u201d a somewhat battered voice states in the last sentence of\nthe essay. Yet the essay ends with an assertion that in its great hope\nand underlying confidence chimes with some of the more expansive\npassages in Emerson\u2019s writing. The \u201ctrue romance which the\nworld exists to realize,\u201d he states, \u201cwill be the\ntransformation of genius into practical power\u201d (CW3: 49).\n\nDespite important differences in tone and emphasis, Emerson\u2019s\nassessment of our condition remains much the same throughout his\nwriting. There are no more dire indictments of ordinary human life\nthan in the early work, \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d where\nEmerson states that \u201cMen in history, men in the world of to-day,\nare bugs, are spawn, and are called \u2018the mass\u2019 and\n\u2018the herd.\u2019 In a century, in a millennium, one or two men;\nthat is to say, one or two approximations to the right state of every\nman\u201d (CW1: 65). Conversely, there is no more idealistic\nstatement in his early work than the statement in \u201cFate\u201d\nthat \u201c[t]hought dissolves the material universe, by carrying the\nmind up into a sphere where all is plastic\u201d (CW6: 15). All in\nall, the earlier work expresses a sunnier hope for human\npossibilities, the sense that Emerson and his contemporaries were\npoised for a great step forward and upward; and the later work, still\nhopeful and assured, operates under a weight or burden, a stronger\nsense of the dumb resistance of the world.\n",
