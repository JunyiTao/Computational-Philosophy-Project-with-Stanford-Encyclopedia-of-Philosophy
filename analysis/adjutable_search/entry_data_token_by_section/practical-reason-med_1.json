    "main_text": "The Franciscan Critique\n2. The Franciscan Critique\n\nThe ethics of natural law, with its impressive union of the\nAugustinian theory of eternal principles and the Aristotelian method\nof moral reasoning, did not remain long unchallenged. Franciscan\ntheologians, John Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, were especially\ncritical of a theory which they considered too restrictive of human\nfreedom. Although Scotus and Ockham never produced treatises\nspecifically devoted to moral theory, the main lines of their\ncritiques may be sketched from their theological works.\n\nScotus\u2019 main concern in his arguments against the\nintellectualism of Albert\u2019s and Thomas\u2019 ethics is his\ndoctrine of the supremacy and freedom of the human will. He claims\nthat there could be no basis for judging an action right or wrong if\nthe will were not free to choose against the dictates of the\nintellect. The will, even if it should act \u2018with reason\u2019\nstill is able to choose between opposite courses of action that lie\nwithin its power; the intellect however, has no power of\nself-determination, since it must assent to what it recognizes as\ntrue. Only the will acts freely, for it has the power of\nself-determination. Scotus argues that a theory of practical reason in\nwhich judgments about actions were restricted to the type of reasoning\ncharacteristic of speculation not only restricts freedom, but also\nremoves any basis for merit or blame. If the moral agent must act in\naccordance with intellectual deduction, then he can only be praised\nfor his intellectual prowess, and not for his moral goodness.\n\nScotus is influenced by Aristotle\u2019s assertion that the end of\npractical knowledge is truth in agreement with right desire. For\nScotus this philosophical expression of the natural law leads him to\nassert one fundamental universal moral principle: \u2018God should be\nloved\u2019. This law is so deeply rooted in human reason that even\nGod\u2019s power cannot release a human being from its obligations.\nThis principle allows Scotus to view his moral theology as consistent\nwith Aristotle\u2019s ethics, since reason leads man to obey\nGod\u2019s commands. The will necessarily and perpetually seeks\nhappiness and the will naturally desires its own perfection. The\nprimary universal command informs the will\u2019s natural desire for\nperfection, and so particular actions, regardless of circumstances,\nare judged in accordance with the will\u2019s conformity to the\nprecept to love God.\n\nScotus\u2019 primary consideration as a moral theologian is the\nnature of freely determined volitional choices. Only secondarily does\nhe consider the goodness of the desired end of the action. When the\nwill freely chooses in accordance with right reason only then can the\nact be considered morally good. Scotus does have some difficulty\nexplaining the relationship between the will and the intellect. If a\nhuman being realizes intellectually that the most desirable goal is\nunion with God, it seems that human intellectual reason would compel\nhim to pursue such an end. If the will does not act in agreement with\nthe rationally derived first principle then it must be necessarily\nwrong. It is thereby difficult to see how the will\u2019s absolute\nfreedom can be maintained.\n\nFaced with such a dilemma, Scotus argues that although the will\npursues an object rationally determined by the intellect, this does\nnot mean that the will is conditioned by \u2018natural\nnecessity\u2019. The apprehension of a possible action is offered to\nthe will as something neutral, while the will remains always free.\n(Ordinatio, IV, d. 46). In Scotus\u2019 view the natural law\nis comprised of self-evident a priori principles, whose\nvalidity the intellect immediately recognizes from the coherence of\nterms. The will then is naturally inclined to assent to their\ndictates, but is not compelled to do so. For Scotus the clearest\nexpression of natural law is the decalogue, which directs all human\nactions towards the attainment of beatitude. The commands of natural\nlaw are not good merely because they are commanded, but are commanded\nbecause they are good. (Ordinatio IV, 17) Scotus considers\nthe first two commandments, that God must be worshipped and revered,\nto be absolutely unalterable. God himself could never negate such\nmoral principles and human beings are morally bound to their\nadherence.\n\nDespite his unrelenting criticisms of many of Scotus\u2019 positions,\nWilliam of Ockham\u2019s moral theology develops, rather than\ndismisses, the main lines of Scotus\u2019 ethical deliberations.\nOckham too is concerned primarily with the preservation of volitional\nfreedom, both divine and human. Ockham specifically rejects the theory\nof natural law for determining human acts invariably toward an\nintellectually determined end. His insistence upon the dignity of\nhuman nature and the absolute power of the will for self-determination\nlead Ockham to reject his predecessors\u2019 morality of natural law.\nOckham\u2019s critique of the metaphysics of common nature was not\nlimited to logical and metaphysical speculation; it pertains also to\nhis moral doctrine, wherein the will must be free even to choose\n\u2018evil which is neither really or apparently good.\u2019\n\nThe autonomy of the will is so great that it can absolutely refuse to\npursue beatitude even when it is presented either as a general or\nparticular idea. Even after death (in patria) the will can\nrefuse to desire its own perfection. Volitional freedom is absolute in\nOckham\u2019s moral theology; it can be defined as a natural\ninclination to an end, only insofar as it is an observed general human\ntendency. The human will can just as easily reject its end, as it can\npursue it. (Ordinatio I, d. 1, q. 6).\n\nThe natural foundation of morality, so essential to Albert and Thomas\nand still an important element of Scotus\u2019 thought, is rejected\nby Ockham in favor of a more complete notion of volitional freedom.\nStill Ockham does not advocate an ethics of relativism. The basis for\nhuman moral judgments lies in the will\u2019s conformity to divine\ncommands. Impressed by Scotus\u2019 dictum, \u2018Deus nullius est\ndebitor\u2019 (God is indebted to no one), Ockham extends the power\nof God to reformulate all moral laws. Not only can the commandments\nthat regulate human interactions be altered, but also those that\ndetermine the relationship between God and man. God could command\nhuman beings to hate him and such a precept must be considered as\nmorally binding. Ockham\u2019s use of the more common language of\nmedieval moral theory does not prevent him from emphasizing the\ncontingency of human morality. His belief in the power of human reason\nto discern the rational principles of an ordered life cannot overcome\nhis desire to preserve the unlimited power of God, on whose will all\nmoral principles depends and are subject to change. Both Scotus and\nOckham construct a moral theory of volitional freedom, rather than one\nthat they believe to be the moral determinism of Aristotle and his\nfollowers.\n",
