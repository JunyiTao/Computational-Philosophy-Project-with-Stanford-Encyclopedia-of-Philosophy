    "main_text": "Objections || Exclusion\n7.5 Exclusion\n\nSome critics argue that the idea of public reason\u2014again\nparticularly Rawls\u2019s conception\u2014is in some way unfair or\nunduly exclusionary. This complaint is most often made on behalf of\nthose who would rely on religious arguments when deliberating about\nimportant moral and political questions (Eberle 2002; Greenawalt 1995;\nSmith 2010; Stout 2004; Vallier 2014; Weithman 2002), though the\nobjection is also sometimes made more generally on behalf of those who\nare excluded from the constituency of public reason on normative\ngrounds (Bohman 2003; Friedman 2000). There are many different\nversions of this objection, and the list that follows is not\nexhaustive. Put most forcefully, public reason is a sham: it purports\nto be an impartial or neutral method of moral or political\njustification, but it is, in fact, a form of sectarian secularism or\nmodern liberalism masquerading as something more inclusive. A second,\nless strident, version of this objection points out that even those\ntheories of public reason that are not explicitly secular will\nnevertheless make it more difficult, on balance, for religious\ncitizens to justify their favored views. Public reason cannot help but\ntilt in a secular direction given its requirement that principles or\nrules be reasonably justifiable to all members of the community.\nEveryone can understand and endorse a variety of secular\nconsiderations, but there is no religious idea or argument that all\nreasonable people can accept, and thus public reason has an in-built\nbias against religious doctrines and those who believe such doctrines\nare relevant to moral and political argument. A third version of the\nobjection queries why controversial religious arguments, claims about\nthe good life, or metaphysical arguments, are excluded from playing a\nrole in public reason, but controversial arguments about justice or\nindividual rights are not similarly excluded. If, as the critic\nalleges, nothing can justify this asymmetric treatment of\ncontroversial arguments from different domains of inquiry, then the\nidea of public reason is unjustifiably biased against those who rely\non religious, metaphysical, or perfectionist arguments. This objection\nis sometimes called the asymmetry objection (Brower 1994,\n21\u201322; Caney 1995, 258; Sandel 1998, 202\u2013210; Waldron\n1999, ch. 7). A variant of this objection focuses on the claim that\nreasons must be \u201caccessible\u201d in order to qualify as\npublic. The critics allege that, however the notion of accessibility\nis defined, there will be no clear grounds for declaring that many\nreligious arguments are not accessible and thus nonpublic when\ncompared to various apparently public non-religious arguments (Eberle\n2002, 255\u2013260). Fourth, some critics worry that Rawls\u2019s moral\nduty of civility (see sect. 6 above) will either discourage some\ncitizens from engaging in legitimate acts of religious expression and\nassociation, or at least will create a political atmosphere where\nreligious arguments and those who espouse them are treated as less\nvaluable when compared with purely \u201cpublic\u201d reasons and\nthose who restrict themselves to such arguments (Vallier 2014,\n59\u201364). Finally, some critics argue that public reason is not\nthe only way, and perhaps not the best way, to show respect for\nothers, or show civility, when engaged in moral and political\ndialogue. There are equally plausible conceptions of respect and\ncivility which favor presenting others with the whole truth as we see\nit when engaged in moral or political debate, rather than restricting\nourselves to shared or common reasons. If this is true, then those who\nground their moral or political arguments only in religious or\notherwise nonpublic reasons are not being unreasonable or\ndisrespectful: they are simply following a different, but equally\nplausible, interpretation of what respect or civility requires (Eberle\n2002; Pallikkathayil 2019; Stout 2004, 67\u201385; Weithman\n2002).\n\nA variety of different replies are available for the proponent of\npublic reason. In response to the first charge, defenders of public\nreason can point out that it is not only religious doctrines that are\ndeemed \u201cnonpublic\u201d by leading theories of public reason\nsuch as Rawls\u2019s. Secular doctrines such as utilitarianism or\ncontroversial secular claims about the good life are also deemed\nnonpublic. Thus it seems unfair to allege that public reason is simply\na fig leaf for a secular agenda. In response to the second objection,\ntheorists of public reason may concede that there is a sense in which\npublic reason tilts in a secular direction, but insist this is not an\narbitrary bias, but rather the justifiable result of the requirement\nthat certain principles or rules be justifiable to all those who are\nbound by them. The charge of bias thus in fact depends on a much\ndeeper objection to the public reason project, and so the critic who\npresses the charge of bias must be prepared to rebut the more\nfundamental arguments offered in favor of public reason.\n\nSeveral different responses have been offered in reply to the third\nobjection: the asymmetry objection. Some argue the objection can be\ndefused by constructing an account of public reason (or the closely\nrelated idea of a political liberalism) without appeal to what Rawls\ncalls the burdens of judgment, or other apparently epistemological\npremises (see sect. 1 above) (Lecce 2008, ch. 6). Others deny that\npublic reason should include an accessibility requirement (Vallier\n2011). Finally, others argue that it is a mistake to suppose that\nreligious arguments are excluded from public reason because they are\ncontroversial or the subject or reasonable disagreement amongst\ncitizens, since the same can be said for many non-religious arguments.\nRather, on this view, they are excluded because the disagreements or\ncontroversies over religious and other comprehensive doctrines are\ndeeper or more foundational and lack the normative common ground that\ncharacterize reasonable disagreements over matters of justice and\nindividual rights (Quong 2011, 192\u2013220).\n\nIn response to the fourth charge\u2014that an ideal of public reason\nwill directly or indirectly discourage religious expression, or create\nthe perception that those who invoke religious arguments are, in some\nsense, second class citizens\u2014the proponent of public reason can\noffer at least two replies. First, not all theories of public reason\nshare Rawls\u2019s view regarding the moral duty of civility. As we\nsaw in section 6, some accounts of public reason entail fewer, if any,\ndirect restrictions on the behavior of individual citizens. Second,\nRawls\u2019s own view does not prohibit citizens from offering\nreligious or nonpublic arguments for their favored positions; it only\nrequires that individuals who do so eventually supplement these\narguments with public reasons (again see sect. 6). Finally, proponents\nof public reason are likely to deny that there are plausible\nalternative conceptions of civility or respect that would allow\nreligious and other non-shared arguments to play a more central role\nin moral or political justification (Quong 2013), or else they may\ndeny that the grounds of public reason are in fact best explicated by\nappeal to notions of civility or respect (see sect. 1).\n",
