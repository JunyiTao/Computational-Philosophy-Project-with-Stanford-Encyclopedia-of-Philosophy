    "main_text": "The Maximalism/Omnism Debate\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe actualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate in ethics\ngrew out of a debate concerning the problem that identifying act\nalternatives poses for act-consequentialism. The debate, in its\npresent form, may be traced back to the work of Holly Goldman\u2019s\nand Jordan Howard Sobel\u2019s independent articulations, and\ndefenses of, actualism. Early forms of actualism held that whether an\nagent is obligated to perform an act roughly depends on whether what\nwould happen if the agent performed that act is better than\nwhat would happen if the agent were to perform any alternative act at\nthe time in question. Contrast this with possibilism, which holds that\nwhether an agent is obligated to perform an act depends on whether\nthat act is part of the best maximal act-set the agent could\n(not would) perform over the course of her life. These are\nthe \u201cextreme\u201d versions of actualism and possibilism\nrespectively. To handle cases concerning synchronic acts, and to avoid\nhaving her view prescribe incompatible obligations, Goldman amended\nactualism by building a control condition into the definition in her\n(1978) essay. This revised actualism,\n (G+),\n along with Sobel\u2019s\n (S),\n only holds fixed the acts of an agent that are not presently under\nthe agent\u2019s control. This change proved influential and inspired\nvarious versions of this view, which came to be collectively referred\nto as securitism. Securitist views occupy a middle ground between\n\u201cextreme\u201d forms of actualism and possibilism. A variety of\nother views do too, including McKinsey\u2019s (1979)\nlevels-of-obligation view and Carlson\u2019s (1995, 1999) view. There\nis not yet a consensus about which view, if any, is the most\nplausible. Of course, this should not be surprising since the\nactualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate is,\nrelatively speaking, still quite new.\n",
