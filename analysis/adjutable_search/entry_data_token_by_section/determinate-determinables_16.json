    "main_text": "Are determinates metaphysically prior to determinables? || Naturalness\n4.2 Naturalness\n\nAnother criterion takes more fundamental properties to be more\n\u2018natural\u2019, in the terminologically\n inapropos[39]\n meaning of Lewis (1983), in making for greater objective resemblance\nbetween their possessing particulars than do less fundamental\nproperties. This conception appears to deem determinables less\nfundamental than determinates: since determinables are less specific\nthan their associated determinates, particulars sharing a given\ndeterminate property (e.g., scarlet) will be more objectively\nsimilar in the relevant respect than will be particulars sharing an\nassociated determinable property (e.g., red). However,\nobjective resemblance can hold between properties as well as\nparticulars; hence even granting that determinates make for more\nobjective resemblance between particulars, one can reasonably maintain\nthat among the perfectly natural joints are those associated with\ndeterminables, understood as making for objective resemblance between\nassociated determinates (see Wilson\n 2012).[40]\n Such a consideration would support McDaniel\u2019s (2010)\nsupposition that the increase in specificity at issue in determination\ndiffers from that at issue in the disjunction-disjunct relation, in\nthat determinables, unlike disjunctions, are as natural as their\nspecifications.\n",
