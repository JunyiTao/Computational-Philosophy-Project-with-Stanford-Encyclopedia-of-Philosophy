    "main_text": "Ethics || Utilitarianism\n5.2 Utilitarianism\n\nIn utilitarian theory, there are two obvious approaches to such\nproblems. One is the actualist solution. It consists in\nassigning to a (probabilistic) mixture of potential outcomes a utility\nthat is equal to the utility of the outcome that actually\nmaterializes. To exemplify this approach, consider a decision whether\nor not to reinforce a bridge before it is used for a single, very\nheavy transport. There is a 50% risk that the bridge will fall down if\nit is not reinforced. Suppose that a decision is made not to reinforce\nthe bridge and that everything goes well; the bridge is not damaged.\nAccording to the actualist approach, the decision was right. This is,\nof course, contrary to common moral intuitions.\n\nThe other established utilitarian approach is the maximization of\nexpected utility. This means that the utility of a mixture of\npotential outcomes is defined as the probability-weighted average of\nthe utilities of these outcomes.\n\nThe expected utility criterion has been criticized along several\nlines. One criticism is that it disallows a common form of\ncautiousness, namely disproportionate avoidance of large disasters.\nFor example, provided that human deaths are valued equally and\nadditively, as most utilitarians are prone to do, this framework does\nnot allow that one prefers a probability of 1 in 1000 that one person\nwill die to a probability of 1 in 100000 that fifty persons will die.\nThe expected utility framework can also be criticized for disallowing\na common expression of strivings for fairness, namely disproportionate\navoidance of high-probability risks for particular individuals. Hence,\nin the choice between exposing one person to a probability of 0.9 to\nbe killed and exposing each of one hundred persons to a probability of\n0.01 of being killed, it requires that the former alternative be\nchosen. In summary, expected utility maximization prohibits what seem\nto be morally reasonable standpoints on risk-taking and risk\nimposition.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the expected utility criterion does\nnot necessarily follow from utilitarianism. Utilitarianism in a wide\nsense (Scanlon 1982) is compatible with other ways of evaluating\nuncertain outcomes (most notably with actual consequence\nutilitarianism, but in principle also for instance with a maximin\ncriterion). Therefore, criticism directed against expected utility\nmaximization does not necessarily show a defect in utilitarian\nthinking.\n",
