    "main_text": "The Starting Point of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre\n3. The Starting Point of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre\n\nIn order to construct any genuine philosophy of freedom, maintained\nFichte, the reality of freedom itself must simply be presupposed and\nthus treated as an incontrovertible \u201cfact of reason\u201d in\nthe Kantian sense. This, of course, is not to deny the possibility of\nraising skeptical, theoretically grounded objections to such claims;\non the contrary, it was the very impossibility of any theoretically\nsatisfactory refutation of skepticism concerning the reality of\nfreedom that led Fichte to affirm the inescapable \u201cprimacy of\nthe practical\u201d with respect to the selection of one\u2019s\nphilosophical starting point.\n\nTo the extent that any proposed first principle of philosophy is\nsupposed to be the first principle of all knowledge and hence of all\nargument, it clearly cannot be derived from any higher principle and\nhence cannot be established by any sort of reasoning. Furthermore,\nFichte maintained that there are two and only two possible starting\npoints for the philosophical project of \u201cexplaining\u201d\nexperience: namely, the concept of pure selfhood (which Fichte\nassociated with pure freedom) and that of pure thinghood (which Fichte\nassociated with utter necessity)\u2014neither of which can be\nwarranted, qua philosophical starting point, by a direct appeal to\nexperience, and each of which can be arrived at only by a\nself-conscious act of philosophical abstraction from ordinary\nexperience (within which freedom and necessity, subject and object,\nare invariably joined as well as distinguished).\n\nThe two rival philosophical strategies made possible by these opposed\nstarting points are unforgettably limned by Fichte in his two 1797\n\u201cIntroductions to the Wissenschaftslehre,\u201d in\nwhich he characterizes the sort of philosophy that begins with the\npure I as \u201cidealism\u201d and that which begins with the thing\nin itself as \u201cdogmatism.\u201d Since, according to\nFichte\u2019s earlier argument in Concerning the Concept of the\nWissenschaftslehre, a unified system of philosophy can have one\nand only one first principle, and since there are two and only two\npossible first principles, then it follows that no \u201cmixed\u201d\nsystem of idealism/dogmatism is possible. Moreover, since dogmatism,\nas understood by Fichte, unavoidably implies a strict form of\ndeterminism or \u201cintelligible fatalism,\u201d whereas idealism\nis, from the start, committed to the reality of human freedom, it is\nalso practically impossible to reach any sort of\n\u201ccompromise\u201d between two such radically opposed\nsystems.\n\nThough Fichte conceded that neither dogmatism nor idealism could\ndirectly refute its opposite and thus recognized that the choice\nbetween philosophical starting points could never be resolved on\npurely theoretical grounds, he nevertheless denied that any dogmatic\nsystem, that is to say, any system that commences with the concept of\nsheer objectivity, could ever succeed in accomplishing what was\nrequired of all philosophy. Dogmatism, he argued, could never provide\na transcendental deduction of ordinary consciousness, for, in order to\naccomplish this, it would have to make an illicit leap from the realm\nof \u201cthings\u201d to that of mental events or\n\u201crepresentations\u201d [Vorstellungen]. Idealism, in\ncontrast, at least when correctly understood as the kind of Critical\nidealism that demonstrates that the intellect itself must operate in\naccordance with certain necessary laws, can\u2014at least in\nprinciple\u2014accomplish the prescribed task of philosophy and\nexplain our experience of objects (\u201crepresentations accompanied\nby a feeling of necessity\u201d) in terms of the necessary operations\nof the intellect itself, and thus without having to make an illicit\nappeal to things in themselves. To be sure, one cannot decide in\nadvance whether or not any such deduction of experience from the mere\nconcept of free self-consciousness is actually possible.\nThis, Fichte conceded, is something that can be decided only after the\nconstruction of the system in question. Until then, it remains a mere\nhypothesis that the principle of human freedom, for all of\nits practical certainty, is also the proper starting point for a\ntranscendental account of objective experience.\n\nIt must be granted that the truth of the\nWissenschaftslehre\u2019s starting point cannot be\nestablished by any philosophical means, including its utility as a\nphilosophical first principle. On the contrary\u2014and this is one\nof Fichte\u2019s most characteristic and controversial\nclaims\u2014one already has to be convinced, on wholly\nextra-philosophical grounds, of the reality of one\u2019s own freedom\nbefore one can enter into the chain of deductions and\narguments that constitute the Wissenschaftslehre. This is the\nmeaning of Fichte\u2019s oft-cited assertion that \u201cthe kind of\nphilosophy one chooses depends upon the kind of person one is.\u201d\nThe only compelling reason why the transcendental idealist comes to a\nstop with\u2014and thus begins his system with\u2014the proposition\nthat \u201cthe I freely posits itself\u201d is therefore not because\nhe is unable to entertain theoretical doubts on this score nor because\nhe is simply unable to continue the process of reflective abstraction.\nInstead, he appeals to a principle eloquently expressed by Fichte in\nhis essay \u201cOn the Basis of Our Belief in a Moral Governance of\nthe World,\u201d namely: \u201cI cannot go beyond this standpoint\nbecause I am not permitted to do so.\u201d It is precisely because\nthe categorical imperative is in this way invoked to secure the first\nprinciple of his entire system that Fichte felt entitled to make the\nrather startling claim that the Wissenschaftslehre is the\nonly system of philosophy that \u201caccords with duty.\u201d\n",
