    "main_text": "The Second Sex\n2. The Second Sex\n\nIt was, however, with the publication of The Second Sex by\nSimone De Beauvoir, that feminist theorizing about the relation\nbetween the body and the self took center stage. Along with other\nphenomenologists, particularly Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre, Beauvoir\nrecognizes that \u201cto be present in the world implies strictly\nthat there exists a body which is at once a material thing in the\nworld and a point of view towards the world\u201d (Beauvoir 1949\n[1982: 39]). The self, for phenomenologists, as for Freud, is\nnecessarily corporeal, the body constitutes the self. It is not a\nseparate entity to which the self stands in relation. This body,\nhowever, is not simply what biology offers us an account of. The body\nwhich gained their attention was the body as lived, as\nyielding the sensory experiences and lived intentionality of a subject\nnegotiating its world. It is also a body which is encountered by\nothers whose response to it mediates our own sense of being. What is\ncentral to Beauvoir\u2019s account is that such bodily existence, the\npoint of view it provides, and the response it garners, is different\nfor men and women. Her account provides a complex and non-reductive\npicture of the intertwining of the material and the cultural in the\nformation of our embodied selves (see the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir, Kruks 2010,\nSandford 2006, Moi\n1999).\n",
