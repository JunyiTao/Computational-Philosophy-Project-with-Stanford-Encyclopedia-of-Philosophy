    "main_text": "A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology || An Attempted Foundation: Dutch Book Arguments\n1.6 An Attempted Foundation: Dutch Book Arguments\n\nThere have been a number of arguments advanced in support of the two\ncore Bayesian norms. Perhaps the most influential is of the kind\ncalled Dutch Book arguments. Dutch Book arguments are\nmotivated by a simple, intuitive idea: Belief guides action. So, the\nmore strongly you believe that it will rain tomorrow, the more\ninclined you are, or ought to be, to bet on bad weather. This idea,\nwhich connects degrees of belief to betting dispositions, can be\ncaptured at least partially by the following:\n\n\nA Credence-Betting Bridge Principle (Toy\nVersion). If one\u2019s credence in a proposition A is\nequal to a real number a, then it is acceptable for one to buy\nthe bet \u201cWin $100 if A is true\u201d at the price\n\\(\\$100 \\cdot a\\) (and at any lower price).\n\n\n\nThis bridge principle might be construed as part of a definition or as\na necessary truth that captures the nature of credences, or understood\nas a norm that jointly constrains credences and betting dispositions\n(Christensen 1996; Pettigrew 2020a: sec. 3.1). The hope is that,\nthrough this bridge principle or perhaps a refined one, bad credences\ngenerate bad symptoms in betting dispositions. If so, a close look at\nbetting dispositions might help us sort out bad credences from good\nones. This is the strategy that underlies Dutch Book arguments.\n\nTo illustrate, consider an agent who has a .75 credence in proposition\nA and a .30 credence in its negation \\(\\neg A\\) (which violates\nProbabilism). Assuming the bridge principle stated above, the agent is\nwilling to bet as follows:\n\nBuy \u201cwin $100 if A is true\u201d at \\(\\$75\\).\nBuy \u201cwin $100 if \\(\\neg A\\) is true\u201d at \\(\\$30\\).\n\n\nSo the agent is willing to accept each of those two offers.\nBut it is actually very bad to accept both at the same time,\nfor that leads to a sure loss (of $5):\n\n\n\n\n\nA is true\nA is false  \n\n\nbuy \u201cwin $100 if A is\ntrue\u201d at $75\n\\(-\\$75 + \\$100\\)\n\\(-\\$75\\) \n\nbuy \u201cwin $100 if \\(\\neg A\\) is\ntrue\u201d at $30\n\\(-\\$30\\)\n\\(-\\$30 + \\$100\\) \n\nnet payoff\n\\(-\\$5\\)\n\\(-\\$5\\)  \n\n\n\nSo this agent\u2019s betting dispositions make her susceptible to a\nset of bets that are individually acceptable but jointly inflict a\nsure loss. Such a set of bets is called a Dutch Book. The\nabove agent is susceptible to a Dutch Book, which sounds bad for the\nagent. So what has gone wrong? The problem seems to be this: Belief\nguides action, and in this case, bad beliefs result in bad actions:\ngarbage in, garbage out. Therefore, the agent should not have had the\ncombination of credence .75 in \\(A\\) and .30 in \\(\\neg A\\) to begin\nwith\u2014or so a Dutch Book argument would conclude.\n\nThe above line of thought can be generalized and turned into a\ntemplate for Dutch Book arguments:\n\n\nA Template for Dutch Book Arguments\n\nPremise 1. You should follow such and such a credence-betting\nbridge principle (or, due to the nature of credences, you do so\nnecessarily).\nPremise 2. If you do, and if your credences violate constraint\nC, then provably you are susceptible to a Dutch Book.\nPremise 3. But you should not be so susceptible.\nConclusion. So your credences should satisfy constraint\nC.\n\n\n\nThere is a Dutch Book argument for Probabilism (Ramsey 1926, de\nFinetti 1937). The idea can be extended to develop an argument for the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization (Lewis 1999, Teller 1973). Dutch Book\narguments have also been developed for other norms for credences, but\nthey require modifying the concept of a Dutch Book in one way or\nanother. See\n section 3\n for references.\n\nAn immediate worry about Dutch Book arguments is that a higher\ncredence might not be correlated with a stronger disposition to bet.\nConsider a person who loathes very much the anxiety caused by placing\na bet. So, though she is very confident in a proposition, she might\nstill refuse to buy a bet on its truth even at a low price\u2014and\nrightly so. This seems to be a counterexample to premise 1 in the\nabove. For more on Dutch Book arguments, including objections to them\nas well as refinements of them, see the survey by H\u00e1jek (2009)\nand the entry on\n Dutch Book arguments.\n\nThere is a notable worry that applies even if we have a Dutch Book\nargument that is logically valid and only has true premises. A Dutch\nBook argument seems to give only a practical reason for\naccepting an epistemic norm: \u201cDon\u2019t have such and\nsuch combinations of credences, for otherwise there would be something\nbad pragmatically\u201d. Such a reason seems unsatisfactory for those\nwho wish to explain the correctness of the Bayesian norms with a\nreason that is distinctively epistemic or at least non-pragmatic. Some\nBayesians still think that Dutch Book arguments are good, and address\nthe present worry by trying to give a non-pragmatic reformulation of\nDutch Book arguments (Christensen 1996; Christensen 2004: sec. 5.3).\nSome other Bayesians abandon Dutch Book arguments and pursue\nalternative foundations of Bayesian epistemology, to which I turn\nnow.\n\n\n",
