    "main_text": "The Ontology of Nonexistence (abh\u0101va) and the Semantics of Negative Statements || Temporally and Spatially Located Absence\n11.2 Temporally and Spatially Located Absence\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 85\u201388) reports the usual\nNy\u0101ya view that there are four types of absence: prior\nnonexistence (pr\u0101gabh\u0101va); posterior nonexistence\nor \u2018destruction\u2019 (dhva\u1e43sa);\n\u2018constant\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 absence\n(atyant\u0101bh\u0101va); and difference\n(anyony\u0101bh\u0101va). Of these, the first two refer to\npossible temporal states of a transient object. Suppose we represent\nthe temporal duration of a person A by the following line\n(assuming that he lived between 1650 and 1750):\n\n\n\nt1\n1650\nt2\n1750\nt3\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\n\nAt any time t1 prior to 1650, A does not\nyet exist, and at any time t3 later than 1750,\nA no longer exists. In accordance with the above principles,\nNy\u0101ya reformulates these negative existential claims as positive\nexistential statements about negative entities, namely, the\n\u2018prior absence of A\u2019,\n\u2018<A\u2019 say, and the \u2018posterior absence of\nA\u2019, \u2018A>\u2019 say. Thus, the first\nreads:\n\n<A exists at t1,\n\n\nor, since, in the Ny\u0101ya idiom, objects are said to be located in\ntime as well as in space,\n\n<A is located at t1.\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\nA> is located at t3.\n\n\nWhat happens at times such as t2? These are times\nat which A exists or is present (is located). Note,\nfurthermore, that, at t2, there is a posterior\nabsence of <A (for the prior absence of A is\ndestroyed when A comes into existence), which we designate by\n\u2018(<A)>\u2019. There is also a prior absence of\nA> (for the posterior absence of A does not yet\nexist), i.e. \u2018<(A>)\u2019. The Manual of\nReason (TSD 89E) records the older Naiy\u0101yikas\u2019 claim\nthat these double absences must be identical with the original entity,\non pain of an infinite regress. Thus:\n\n(<A)> = <(A>) = A.\n\n\nLater Naiy\u0101yikas apparently disputed this natural identity (which\ncorresponds to the Law of Double Negation in classical logic), on the\nground that double negative constructions contain the concept of\nnegation, and hence are logically more complex.\n\nA third type of absence, called \u2018constant\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute\u2019 absence (atyant\u0101bh\u0101va) is\nillustrated by constructions of the form \u201cThe pot is not on the\nground\u201d. The Manual of Reason states (TS 87) that what\ndistinguishes this type of absence is that it is located in the three\ntimes\u2014past, present and future. This seems odd, as it might be\nthat the pot is on the ground at some times but not others. Perhaps\nthe point is that the locus of the absence here is a spatial entity\nrather than a temporal one. For example, the construction \u201cHeat\nis not in ice\u201d illustrates this kind of absence. Perhaps,\nfurthermore, the force of this negation is that the pot is\nnever located on the ground\u2014hence we cannot speak of\nthe prior or posterior absence of the pot (for these concepts are\ndefined in terms of times when the pot is present). (E.g.\nUdayana\u2019s definition of a substance as that which does not have\na constant absence of qualities.)\n\nThe fourth type of absence, \u2018difference\u2019\n(anyony\u0101bh\u0101va), is illustrated by the sentence\n\u201cThe pot is not (the) cloth\u201d. This is to be read as a\nnon-identity statement.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas thus say that every negative sentence is the\nnegation of a sentence of the form\n\u201caRb\u201d, and they distinguish\nbetween cases where the relation R is the identity relation\nand cases where it is a relation other than identity. The object\na is called the locus of the absence, and the object\nb is called the \u2018counterpositive\u2019 or\n\u2018negatum\u2019 (pratiyogin) of the absence, i.e. it is\nthe object whose presence in the locus is being denied. This\nhighlights the fact that absences are thought of as a kind of property\nor \u2018locatable\u2019, rather than as a kind of\n\u2018location\u2019 (at least when the relation is not identity).\nFor example, the absence of A is located in many places at\nonce. It is not said that there is a distinct absence-of-A at\neach and every place where A is absent. We can now see how\nthe Ny\u0101ya parse negative sentences without using a sentential\nnegation. Take the sentence \u201cThe pot is not blue\u201d. The\nfirst-order paraphrase of this would be: It is not the case that the\npot is blue (\u00acFa). The Ny\u0101ya strategy is\nfirst to say that every property, such as blueness, has both an\nextension F (places where it is located) and a\ncounter-extension F\u2032 (places where its absence is\nlocated), and then to paraphrase the sentence as: The pot has\nabsence-of-blue. Note that a partially locatable property is one for\nwhich the extension and counter-extension overlap\u2014it is possible\nfor a feature to be collocated with its absence.\n",
