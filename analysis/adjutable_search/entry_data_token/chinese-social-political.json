Neither\n\u201csocial\u201d nor \u201cpolitical\u201d have ready correlates\nin Chinese prior to the nineteenth century, but Chinese thinkers\nconsistently have been concerned with understanding how both\nindividuals and institutions have broad effects in what we can call\nboth social and political modes. In some cases, the philosophers\nnarrowly focus on governance and the state, but in many other cases,\nno firm distinction is made between the realms of political, social,\nand even family or individual. The scope of social and political\nthought, and its relation to other concerns like individual ethics,\nare discussed in\n Section 1.\n\nThe bulk of this entry is arranged chronologically, beginning with the\nmost important texts of the classical (or pre-Imperial) era; then\nbriefly attending to developments in the early Imperial era; next\nlooking more carefully at some of the key developments in the 800-year\nNeo-Confucian era; and ending with Chinese social and political\nthinking over the last 150 years. The organization within each section\ndiffers because of differences in our sources. While theories\nconcerning the composition and dating of classical texts remain\nintensely controversial, it is at least clear that our default should\nnot be to treat these texts as the products of single authors at a\nsingle time, much less as representing the theories of\nwell-established schools of thought. Instead, it makes sense to take\nindividual texts, and sometimes individual chapters, as our basic\nunits of analysis. The nature and authorship of sources are clearer as\nwe move into later eras, and so a topical organization makes sense for\nsubsequent sections of the entry.\n\nSeveral questions are central to the teachings and debates that make\nup Chinese social and political thought, among which the issue of how\nto sustain \u201corder (zhi)\u201d\u2014often understood\nmore particularly as \u201charmony (he)\u201d\u2014is the\nmost basic. To what degree should we rely on institutions (and of what\nkinds?), and to what degree is human leadership crucial? What sorts of\nroles, relationships, or hierarchies should structure our societies,\nand how are they justified? Can they be challenged or changed? Insofar\nas society is divided into rulers and ruled, what are the\nresponsibilities that each owes to the other, and why? We will see\nthat social and political topics routinely connect up with other\naspects of Chinese philosophy\u2014for example, answers to some of\nthe questions just raised lead to further ethical, epistemic, or\nmetaphysical questions\u2014but for the most part it is still\npossible to make sense of social and political thought in its own\nterms.\n", "toc": [{"#ScopPoli": "1.

The Scope of the \u201cPolitical\u201d\n\nOn one common reading, a ruler\u2019s authority is based in\nindividual moral charisma (or virtue; de). The famous\n\u201cMandate of Heaven (tianming)\u201d theory has its\nroots in the way that the Zhou people legitimized their conquest of\nthe Shang. Passages in the Book of History tell us that\nHeaven (tian: the deity of the Zhou people) had transferred\nits \u201cmandate\u201d from the Shang to the Zhou leaders, as a\nresult of the depravity and misrule of the Shang kings. The Zhou\nleadership claimed to know this by employing oracle bone divination:\nthey adopted the Shang practice of divining, but put it to the new use\nof justifying political authority, and thus the shift of\nHeaven\u2019s favor (partly by eliding the difference between the\nShang chief deity and their own). One aspect of this transformation\nwas transforming Heaven into a moral figure, a god who made judgments\nbased on the perceived virtue of the leader (Allan 1984). As we will\nsee below, by the time of the Warring States era and the foundational\ntexts of Confucian philosophy, there have been further\ntransformations: Heaven is no longer a figure at all, but closer to an\nabstract sense of the normative order of the universe, and its\nintentions are no longer accessible via divination. Still, most modern\nscholars hold that for the majority of classical thinkers, an ethical\nideal continues to serve as the ultimate justification of political\nauthority.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, though, that there is attention in Confucian\ntexts to procedural matters and to the norm of \u201corder\u201d, at\nleast partly separate from rulers\u2019 virtue. Some interpreters\nhave argued that this means the Confucians recognized a distinct\nspecies of \u201cpolitical\u201d norms, and that such political\nconcerns were more important to the Confucians than the achievement of\nindividual, rarefied ethical states. For example, in his discussion of\nunder what circumstances Mencius judges a rebellion to be justified,\nJustin Tiwald emphasizes that Mencius \u201cputs a great deal of\nweight on the essentially procedural requirement that the ruler be\nproperly designated for the task\u201d (Tiwald 2008: 274).\nEven more explicitly, Loubna El Amine argues at length in her\nClassical Confucian Political Thought for the importance of a\ndistinct sphere of politics. She says that while \u201cthe realm of\npolitics is not completely distinct from the realm of ethics,\u2026\npolitical order, not moral edification, is the end\u201d; and\nfurthermore that \u201cpolitical order is an end in itself, not a\nmeans toward virtue\u201d (El Amine 2015: 15).\n\nAll interpreters agree that there is at least a narrow kind of\npolitical legitimacy in play, of the type that tells one who the\nlegitimate heir to the throne should be. According to the\nMencius, in the earliest days, political power was passed on\nvia sagely, particularistic assessment of who was most qualified to\nrule, coupled with the endorsement of Heaven, as viewed through the\nactions of the people. This is how the throne was passed from Yao to\nShun, and from Shun to Yu. This practice quickly fell apart, though,\nand in its (supposed) place arose the mechanisms of hereditary\nmonarchy (MC 5A:5 and 5A:6). This is an ingenious explanation for the\nshift that also helps to explain why Confucius was never tapped to\nrule in the way that Shun had been. Mou Zongsan has influentially\nargued that the shift from sagely judgment on who is best fit to rule,\nto hereditary monarchy, is a shift from a holistic form of ethical\nauthority to what is merely an effective technology for the\nadministration of power instead of genuine political authority (Mou\n1991: 132). In other words, Mou agrees with El Amine on the existence\nof a relatively distinct realm of politics, though\u2014writing as a\nmodern Confucian philosopher\u2014Mou regrets the degree to which\nthis shallow form of politics is disconnected from justification\ndeeper than \u201corder\u201d, and argues for a re-imagining of\nConfucian politics (on which see\n Section 5).\n\nWhile Mou\u2019s argument that Confucian political thought is too\nnarrow is certainly controversial, all agree that at least some\nclassical thinkers focus on effective technology for the\nadministration of power and the maintenance of order, to the exclusion\nof ethical concerns. Indeed, one of the better arguments that\nConfucians really did refuse to separate the ethical and the political\nis simply that so many of the Confucians\u2019 critics interpreted\nthem in this way. Whatever we decide about early Confucians, it is\nquite evident that a millennium later, most Neo-Confucians took ethics\nand politics to be mutually entailing, as we will see in\n Section 4.\n2. The Classical Era\n\nA small amount of historical context will be useful before we begin.\nThe Zhou people conquer the Shang in approximately 1046 BCE, and for\nthe next several hundred years, the central plains of what is now\nChina were either ruled directly by the Zhou king, or else by elite\nfamilies loyal to the Zhou, in a kind of feudal system. By the Spring\nand Autumn era (771 BCE\u2013476 BCE), the power of the feudal lords\nhad eclipsed that of the Zhou king, but a rough peace still prevailed\nwith different feudal lords acting as \u201chegemon\n(ba)\u201d. This system then breaks down and the\npre-Imperial period enters its final stage, the Warring States era\n(often dated 475 BCE\u2013221 BCE), which received its name from the\nincessant warfare conducted between the realms that established\nthemselves as independent powers after the effective demise of the\nZhou dynasty. Not only was warfare common in this period; it was also\nincreasingly vast in scope, as the chariot armies of the elite made\nway for much larger conscript-based armies. This change was in turn\nrelated to the increasing abilities of states to raise, organize, and\nfeed such large armies. Both larger populations and more complex\ngovernmental structures lay behind these developments. All these\ninter-related developments, finally, both drove and were shaped by the\nera\u2019s social and political philosophies. The texts that we\nexamine here all date from the Warring States era, a period of\npluralistic debate that establishes key terms and questions addressed\nby Chinese thinkers for many centuries thereafter. Three general,\nprovocative treatments of this era are El Amine 2015, Bai 2012, and\nPines 2012, and Hsiao 1979 is a classic account of the subject.\n2.1 Guanzi: Carrot and Stick\n\nThe earliest chapters of the Guanzi, which were composed in\nthe state of Qi and date from the mid-4th century BCE, are\namong the first theoretical writings on governance. In a famous\npassage from \u201cShepherding the People\u201d, we find that\n\u201cSuccess in government lies in following the hearts of the\npeople\u201d. Success is not defined as making the people\nhappy\u2014we learn elsewhere that success for the ruler is having a\nstrong state that endures through the ages\u2014but following the\npeople\u2019s wishes turns out to be a necessary condition for\nsuccess. Thus:\n\n\nWhen the granaries are full, the people will know propriety and\nmoderation; when their clothing and food are adequate, they will know\nthe distinction between honor and shame.\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\nIf the ruler can ensure the people their existence and provide them\nwith security, they will be willing to endure danger and disaster for\nhim. (GZ ch. 1, pp. 54 and 52)\n\n\nThis is not to say that the people should be given free reign. If they\nare well fed and put to work at tasks well-suited to them, they are\nlikely to accord with propriety and moderation, but the author adds\nthat rulers must \u201cMake clear the road to certain death\u201d,\nby which he means \u201chaving severe punishments\u201d for those\nwho go astray (GZ ch. 1, p. 55). In another chapter of the text,\npossibly by the same author, we find:\n\n\nThose who shepherd the people desire them to be controllable. Since\nthey desire them to be controllable, they must pay serious attention\nto standards (fa). (GZ ch. 3, p. 98)\n\n\nThese \u201cstandards\u201d are then enumerated to include honoring\nranks and ceremonial dress, giving salaries and rewards to the\ndeserving, granting offices, and applying punishments. The\nGuanzi thus presents us with versions of the two techniques\nof governance that will run throughout the texts of the Warring\nStates: nurturing the people and setting them standards.\n2.2 Mozi: Theological or Utilitarian Justification?\n\nRoughly contemporary with the Guanzi is the Mozi,\none chapter of which begins:\n\n\nIn ancient times, when people were first born and before there were\nany punishments or government, in their languages each had a different\nnotion of rightness (yi). One man had one notion, two men had\ntwo\u2026. Thus those with good doctrines would keep them secret and\nrefuse to teach them. (MZ ch. 11, p. 91, translation significantly\nmodified by author)\n\n\nThis of course led to chaos and suffering, the cause of which was the\nabsence of \u201ca leader to govern\u201d. A ruler was therefore\nselected, declared the \u201cSon of Heaven\u201d, and provided with\na staff of ministers to aid him. The ruler then established the single\nidea of rightness that all would heed. The text describes a\ncomprehensive hierarchy according to which each individual would heed\nhis or her superior\u2019s judgment as to what was \u201cgood\n(shan)\u201d, ultimately leading up to the ruler who would\nbase his judgment on Heaven.\n\n\u201cHeaven (tian)\u201d is a difficult term. It once\nclearly referred to a religious entity, but eventually comes to be\nunderstood in more naturalistic terms. Which it means in this chapter\nis a matter of scholarly disagreement. For the most part, Warring\nStates philosophers of governance do not appeal to supernatural\nstandards to justify their claims. Even in the Mozi, if one\ntakes evidence from other chapters into account, the interpretive\ndispute over \u201ctian\u201d may be moot. These other\nchapters record that just as carpenters can use a compass to determine\nwhat is circular, so an understanding of the \u201cwill of\nHeaven\u201d leads one to reliably judge what is right. The striking\nthing about a compass is that no special knowledge is needed to use\nit: it is a public, objective standard for circles. If the \u201cwill\nof Heaven\u201d is to be analogous, then there must be a public,\nobjective standard for right. Mysterious knowledge of the will of a\ndeity does not sound like a good candidate for such a public,\nobjective standard. The text offers an alternative, though: it\nregularly speaks of maximally \u201cbenefitting (li)\u201d\nthe people as a standard. A neat way of resolving all these loose\nends, then, is to conclude that the \u201cwill of Heaven\u201d is a\nmetaphorical reference to the standard of \u201cbenefit\u201d.\nProper Mohist governance thus would ultimately be a matter of\nutilitarian judgment. \n2.3 Analects (Lunyu) and Mencius\n\nOstensibly a collection of sayings by Confucius and his students, much\nif not all of the Analects was composed after\nConfucius\u2019s death, and its various chapters express the\nteachings of individuals who identified themselves with\nConfucius\u2019s legacy. The earliest chapters in the text\n(mid-5th to mid-4th century BCE; chs. 3\u20139)\nmay well be the earliest written philosophical reflection in China,\nbut show little direct concern with governance. In one of the most\ndramatic shifts in the text, governance takes center stage in a set of\nchapters (12, 13, 2) which may date from the last quarter of the\n4th century BCE (Brooks & Brooks 1998). The theory of\nthis segment of the Analects has much in common with the\nGuanzi. Asked about government, \u201cConfucius\u201d is\nmade to say: \u201cEnough food; enough weapons; the people having\nconfidence in the ruler\u201d (LY 12:7, p. 91). Of these,\n\u201cconfidence (xin)\u201d is most important.\n\u201cConfidence\u201d here means that one identifies with\none\u2019s ruler, doing so because he manifestly seeks what is good\nfor one (see also LY 13:29\u201330).\n\nThe dynamic of people identifying with and modeling themselves on the\nruler permeates the text\u2019s understanding of governance. Asked\nwhether a ruler should kill those who fail to follow the way\n(dao), Confucius responds:\n\n\nYou are there to govern; what use have you for killing? If you desire\nthe good, the people will be good. The virtue of the gentleman is the\nwind; the virtue of the little people is the grass. The wind on the\ngrass will surely bend it. (LY 12:19, p. 94; see also LY 2:1)\n\n\nUnlike the emphasis put on \u201cpunishments\u201d as one kind of\n\u201cstandard (fa)\u201d in the Guanzi, the\nAnalects here minimizes the importance of killing. This point\nis reinforced in perhaps the most famous saying in the text about\ngovernance:\n\n\nLead them with government and regulate them by punishments, and the\npeople will evade them with no sense of shame. Lead them with virtue\nand regulate them by ritual, and they will acquire a sense of\nshame\u2014and moreover, they will be orderly. (LY 2:3, p. 110)\n\n\nThere are only a few passages in the text that stress the continued\nneed for punishments in a good society, and they all come quite late\nin the text: 13:3 is an obvious interpolation, and like the similar\n20:2, probably dates to the mid-third century BCE.\n\nIn a variety of ways the Mencius picks up where\nAnalects 12, 13, and 2 left off. One innovation of the\nMencius is to give a name to its preferred mode of\ngovernance: \u201chumane government (renzheng)\u201d. This\nmeans that one should rule by loving the people like a parent loves\nhis children: providing for them, educating them, giving them a role\nmodel. The text stresses that while this policy is beneficial to all\ninvolved, one must pursue it out of humane concern rather than out of\ncold calculation. Because of the ruler\u2019s ability to transform\nothers through his example, if he acts on the basis of \u201cbenefit\n(li)\u201d alone, his subjects will do so as well, and each\nfrom his or her own, narrow perspective. The result will be chaos and\nsuffering, rather than order, harmony, and mutual benefit, all of\nwhich would arise from genuinely humane governance (MC 1A:1).\n\nThe Mencius emphasizes humane governance as well as the\ndistinction between rightness (yi) and mere concern with\nbenefit, rejecting utilitarian calculation without regard to\nrightness. It also opposes coercive authority, recognizing that even\nmodeling and role-emulation work indirectly:\n\n\nYou can never win the allegiance of people by trying to dominate them\nwith goodness; but if you use goodness to nurture them, then you will\nwin the allegiance of the whole world. (MC 4B:16; see also 7A:14)\n\n\nFrom other places in the text we can tell that Mencius (or his\nfollowers) knew and disapproved of the Mohists; this passage\ncriticizes the Mohist practice of directly enforcing a standard of\ngoodness through hierarchy. The Mencius contains numerous\nhierarchical ideas (see esp. MC 3A:4), but it has considerable faith\nin the people\u2019s ability to do good if they are provided for, and\nnot otherwise (see MC 1A7, 3A3).\n\nBoth the Mozi and the Guanzi stress the need for\nobjective standards (fa), as will many subsequent texts. In\nthis context Analects 12, 13, and 2 and Mencius\nstand out as not taking fa seriously. Even when we come upon\nthe tool metaphor in Mencius (MC 4A:1), it is applied to the\nidea of \u201chumane government\u201d rather than to specific,\ninstitutionalizable standards. This is not to say that the\nAnalects and Mencius were devoid of any notion of\n\u201cstandard\u201d. Their standard, though, is resolutely\nparticular, rather than objective and general: the model set by the\nethical ruler. The later Analects (e.g., 13:3, a late\ninterpolation) and the Xunzi (see below) recognize a role for\ncoercion, but authority in the earlier \u201cConfucian\u201d texts\nis non-coercive. People follow willingly, initially because the good\nruler provides for them, and increasingly because they come to love\nhim as a father: they are transformed from individuals into members of\na single, state-wide family.\n2.4 Dao De Jing: Nature and Non-Action (Wuwei)\n\nThe \u201cGuodian\u201d version of the Dao De Jing,\ndiscovered in a tomb in 1993, begins:\n\n\nCut off knowledge, abandon argumentation, and the people will benefit\na hundredfold. Cut off cleverness, abandon \u201cbenefit\u201d, and\nthere will be no more thieves or bandits. Cut off activity and abandon\npurposefulness, and the people will again be filial\u2026. Exhibit\nthe unadorned and embrace the simple. Have little thought of self and\nfew desires. (Henricks 2000: 28; cp. ch. 19 of received version\n[DDJ])\n\n\nIn several respects the attitude here expressed mirrors that of the\nMencius: explicit discussion of \u201cbenefit\u201d is\nrejected, though the indirect goal of benefitting the people is\nendorsed; argumentation\u2014whether referring to litigation or\nlogical disputation\u2014is rejected; a simple life with \u201cfew\ndesires\u201d (cp. MC 7B:35) is favored. On at least the first two\ncounts, Mohism seems the specific target (as it is in the\nMencius as well).\n\nDespite these resonances, though, there are also important differences\nbetween the Dao De Jing and Mencius. Most important\nare the differences in their respective positive accounts of what\nrulers should do. In the Mencius, rulers are enjoined to\nfollow the way of the ancient kings and establish a humane government.\nThe Dao De Jing is much more reticent about articulating any\nspecific human standard; indeed, in the received version of the text,\nthe line which reads \u201cCut off activity and abandon\npurposefulness\u201d in the Guodian version has been updated to\n\u201cCut off \u2018humaneness\u2019 and abandon\n\u2018rightness\u2019\u201d, thus extending to followers of\nConfucius the treatment initially reserved only for Mohists.\n\nThe best communities, as far as the Dao De Jing is concerned,\nare those that form and flourish naturally, with little guidance from\nabove. Later chapters will add that the community is best if small and\nisolated (DDJ ch. 80), as well as providing theoretical justifications\nfor the success of such communities, as for instance:\n\n\nThe way is revered and virtue is honored not because this is decreed\nby any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\n(DDJ ch. 51)\n\n\nRulers succeed by allowing nature to take its course: by \u201cnot\nacting (wuwei)\u201d. Ironically, some of the Dao De\nJing\u2019s teachings are appropriated as straight-forward\npolitical advice by certain later thinkers. The Han Feizi (on\nwhich see more below), for example, echoes the Dao De Jing in\ncalling for rulers to avoid articulating explicit standards or\ndesires, but it does so in order to make sure that ministers cannot\npander to the ruler, rather than out of a deeper objection to\nstandards as such.\n2.5 Zhuangzi: Rejecting Governance\n\nUnlike the Dao De Jing, with which it is often lumped as\nfellow \u201cDaoist\u201d texts, it is difficult to read the\nZhuangzi as concerned with governance or aimed at rulers.\nThis is not to say that the text advocates anarchism; like all texts\nfrom the Warring States, it seems to take for granted that states will\nhave rulers. To a greater extent than any other text, though, it is\nuninterested in the problems rulers faced and even seems disinclined\nto grant rulers any special authority. It is certainly at odds with\nthose thinkers who believe that people must come to identify with\ntheir states. One gloss for the attitude of the text towards\ngovernance issues, in fact, might be: avoid commitment, accept what\ncomes.\n\nAt the heart of the text is a radical linguistic and epistemological\nargument against accepting any one perspective as ultimately,\neternally correct. \u201cClarity (ming)\u201d comes when\none realizes the perspectival nature of all affirmations and denials.\nHaving attained this kind of clarity, it makes no sense to put oneself\non the line for any one set of evaluations, like \u201cour state must\ntriumph\u201d or even \u201cit is better for humans to flourish than\nplants\u201d. In the context of the harsh realities of the Warring\nStates, these doctrines may well have appealed to many.\n2.6 Book of Lord Shang: Benefit Through Order\n\nThe Book of Lord Shang (Shangjun shu) builds on two\nthemes that we have already encountered. First, it argues that\n\u201cthe greatest benefit to the people is order\n(zhi)\u201d (SJS ch. 7). This is to implicitly accept that\n\u201cbenefit (li)\u201d is the standard by which theories\nof governance are judged, but it also places particular stress on the\ncollective character of \u201cbenefit\u201d. In a war-torn world, we\nare told, only when the state is strong can its inhabitants flourish.\nThose who act for their own interests rather than for the\n\u201cbenefit of the state\u201d, therefore, are to be punished (SJS\nch. 14). The text is no friend of those who like to debate and push\ntheir own agendas; it prefers a people devoted to agriculture who are\n\u201csimple (pu) and easy to direct\u201d (SJS ch. 3). We\ncan see here, in short, that one result of the fuzziness surrounding\nthe idea of \u201cbenefitting the people\u201d is that if clearer\ncriteria can plausibly be seen as necessary conditions for benefitting\nthe people, they take center stage. A prime example is\n\u201corder\u201d. Disorder, it is natural to assume, is\nincompatible with the people\u2019s well-being, so rulers could\nconcentrate on order and allow benefit to follow in its wake.\nEspecially when combined with the idea that the people tend to be\nselfish and not understand what is really good for them, though, a\nfocus on order can rapidly lead to tyranny.\n\nAnother idea we have seen already is that governance demands objective\nstandards. This is a central theme of the Book of Lord Shang.\nIt repeatedly stresses the importance of public, impartial standards\n(fa) for application of punishment and reward.\n\u201cFa\u201d is often translated \u201claw\u201d, but\nits uses here and elsewhere are clearly broader than mere penal law.\nOne kind of standard, to be sure, is the penal statute\n(xian), but standards take many other forms. The fact that\nrewards and punishments are regularly attached to standards makes it\nclear that these are normative expectations, and not just ideals. In\nanother way the \u201cfa\u201d are more than ideals: they\nare institutionalized. This aspect no doubt explains part of the\nappeal of translating \u201cfa\u201d as \u201claw\u201d,\nsince we often think of laws as norms that are subject to some kind of\nenforcement, unlike ethical ideals.\n\nFinally, the text also insists that there be no debate over what the\nstandards are nor about when they have been fulfilled: the ruler alone\nfixes the standard based on his assessment of the needs of the age. He\nshould neither imitate antiquity nor follow current standards. What is\ncrucial is that his standards set out the distinct roles\n(fen) expected of people, as well as the rewards and\npenalties that will enforce these roles. The text adds that the\nintelligent ruler will not fail to carry out his own role, on pain of\n\u201charming the standards\u201d.\n2.7 Shen Buhai: Bureaucratic \u201cNon-Action\u201d\n\nShen became Chancellor of the state of Han in 354 BCE and died 337\nBCE. Early bibliographies list a text bearing his name, but all that\nremains of it are quotations in other works; the original has been\nlost. It is thus difficult to date this material.\n\nShen\u2019s central insight seems to have been that government should\nbe based not on feudal principles, but on a bureaucratic system. Creel\nobserves that Shen favored \u201ca system of administration by means\nof professional functionaries, whose functions are more or less\ndefinitely prescribed\u201d (SBH p. 55). Rulers should not find good\nmen and give them responsibility, but instead find the right man for\neach role in the system. The role of the ruler in such a theory is\nsimple: define the needed functions and select men to perform them,\nthen \u201cdo nothing (wuwei)\u201d. Doing nothing does not\nmean to literally abstain from action, but the ruler does nothing more\nthan keep the system running smoothly. Shen compares the ruler to a\nscale:\n\n\n\u2026 which merely establishes equilibrium, itself doing nothing;\nyet the mere fact that it remains in balance causes lightness and\nheaviness to discover themselves. (SBH p. 352)\n\n\nUnlike the Dao De Jing, which seems to trust nature more than\nman, Shen Buhai trusts man-made institutions more than\nindividuals\u2019 decision-making powers.\n2.8 Xunzi: Transforming the People\n\nChapter 19 of the Xunzi contains one of the Warring States\nera\u2019s most famous origin stories.\n\n\nFrom what did ritual (li) arise? I say: Humans are born\nhaving desires. When they have desires but do not get the objects of\ntheir desire, then they cannot but seek some means of satisfaction. If\nthere is no measure or limit to their seeking, then they cannot help\nbut struggle with each other. If they struggle with each other then\nthere will be chaos, and if there is chaos then they will be\nimpoverished. The former kings hated such chaos, so they established\nrituals and rightness in order to establish distinctions among the\npeople, to nurture their desires, and to satisfy their seeking. (XZ\nch. 19, p. 201, slightly modified by author)\n\n\nRitual (li\u2014a different character from that for\n\u201cbenefit\u201d) was important in many chapters of the\nAnalects, but takes on an even more central role here. While\npeople (unlike animals) have the ability to notice and pay heed to\ndistinctions (fen), they will not do so naturally. Their\ndesires have to be shaped through on-going ritual education in order\nfor society to be harmonious and for people to flourish. The text\nexplicitly links ritual with the idea of \u201cstandard\n(fa)\u201d: \u201cTo reject ritual is to be without\nstandards\u201d, and \u201ca man without standards is lost and\nguideless\u201d (XZ ch. 2, p. 14, modified). Unlike the explicit\nregulations for when punishments and rewards are deserved of the\nBook of Lord Shang, that is, the Xunzi takes\nstandards to come through having been taught ritual by an expert\nteacher\u2014by one\u2019s immediate teacher, by one\u2019s ruler,\nand by the sage kings, who originally established the proper set of\nrituals. Both texts seek to exploit features of peoples\u2019\npsychologies to establish order, both in the name of benefiting the\npeople. The central difference, which hearkens back to\nAnalects 2:3, is that the Book of Lord Shang relies\ndirectly on people\u2019s desire for benefit and hatred of harm,\nwhile the Xunzi relies on people\u2019s ability to care\nabout \u201cdistinctions\u201d in order to transform them. Once\ntransformed, ritual propriety and shame, rather than direct concern\nwith benefit, will guide them.\n\nAlthough Xunzi puts considerable emphasis on the role of standards, he\nalso famously argues that \u201cThere are people who create order;\nthere are no standards creating order of themselves\u201d (XZ ch. 12,\np.117, slightly modified). A major theme in Xunzi\u2019s writings is\nthat explicit standards are necessarily vague, so that the proper\nimplementation of them is underdetermined. He also holds that proper\nimplementation of standards requires a great deal of skill and\ntechnique. Furthermore, he notes that standards sometimes appear to\nconflict with one another, and it requires wisdom and experience to\nknow how to balance such competing considerations. Finally, there is\nno fixed way of systematizing the rules. Changes in circumstance\nrequire that the priority of rules will sometimes need to be revised,\nand this too requires good judgment. For all these reasons, Xunzi\ncredits good people with order, not the standards themselves.\n2.9 Han Feizi: Pragmatic Justification of Practical Policies\n\nLike several earlier texts, the Han Feizi puts considerable\nstress on objective criteria for governance. Rulers are to compare\n\u201cnames (ming)\u201d\u2014that is, explicit statements\nof a position\u2019s duties\u2014with results and bestow awards or\ninflict punishments based on how the two correspond. We also read\nthat: \u201cA truly enlightened ruler uses standards (fa) to\nselect men for him; he does not choose them himself\u201d (HFZ ch. 6,\np. 24). While the ruler does not choose ministers according to his own\njudgment or whim, he still must establish standards in the first\nplace; he cannot simply rely on tradition or precedent:\n\n\nThe sage does not try to practice the ways of antiquity or to abide by\na fixed standard, but examines the affairs of the age and takes what\nprecautions are necessary. (HFZ ch. 49, pp. 96\u20137)\n\n\nThis contrasts with strands in several earlier texts which advocated\nconforming with past tradition. In some of these texts, the recorded\nor imagined practices of earlier ages are thought to have\nepistemological significance: evidence of the insights of the sages.\nOthers, more skeptical about naturalistic justifications, imply that\nobserving tradition is our only means of agreeing on a single set of\nstandards, and without such agreement, disorder looms.\n\nMore common than a desire to conform to old practices, though, is the\nnotion that times change and the good ruler must be prepared to change\nwith them. New standards are needed for a new age. This is even\nendorsed by some of the texts which ground ultimate justification on\nthe natural order: the underlying patterns of nature may not change,\nbut their specific applications can, as human society grows and\nchanges. Other justifications of change are more pragmatic, though,\nand the Han Feizi is perhaps the most explicit. Here we read\nthat rulers are enjoined to measure the gains that come from enacting\nnew standards against the losses that ensue; \u201c\u2026 if one\nfinds gain will exceed losses, one goes ahead with them\u201d (HFZ\nch. 47).\n\nThe Han Feizi also gives us a clearer idea than any earlier\ntext of why rule via standard was to be preferred to rule by the wise\nand virtuous. Chapter 40 puts readers through the following dialectic.\nWe begin with the idea, attributed to Shen Dao, that virtue and wisdom\nare unnecessary for good governance; everything depends on\n\u201cpolitical purchase (shi)\u201d and \u201cstatus\n(wei)\u201d. To this a critic responds that \u201ctalent\n(cai)\u201d is also necessary: give power to the unworthy\nand the result will be chaos. The conclusion follows: when rulers are\nso good or bad that nothing could change them, we will call that\nshi-by-nature and set that aside. But such men are rare. The\nauthor is interested in the average ruler, for whom shi is\ncrucial. So in the end we are back to Shen Dao\u2019s position as the\nonly tenable one for the vast majority of rulers\u2014and for all the\nrulers for whom the author\u2019s advice is going to make any\ndifference.\n\nAnother theme of the text is the conflict between individuals and\npublic, state interests. We are shown that even for the virtuous,\nfamily loyalties regularly trump state loyalties, and thus:\n\n\nSince the interests of superior and inferior are as disparate as all\nthis, it is hopeless for the ruler to praise the actions of the\nprivate individual and at the same time try to insure blessing on the\nstate\u2019s altars of the soil and grain. (HFZ ch. 49, p. 107)\n\n\nThe author analyzes this as a conflict between \u201cprivate\n(si)\u201d and \u201cpublic (gong)\u201d\nperspectives, and argues that the two are mutually irreconcilable.\n\nThe ruler, in particular, must heed the distinction between\ngong and si. For instance,\n\n\n\u2026 For his part the ruler must never make selfish (si)\nuse of his wise ministers or able men, so the people are never tempted\nto go beyond their communities to form friendships. (HFZ, ch. 6, p.\n25)\n\n\nThe clear suggestion is that ruler can be blamed if people conspire\nagainst him. In another chapter, we read that\n\n\nTo fail to heed your loyal ministers when you are at fault, insisting\non having your own way, which will in time destroy your good\nreputation and make you a laughing stock of others. (HFZ ch. 10, p.\n49)\n\n\nWhile there are certainly some sections of the text that paint the\nrelationship between rulers and ministers as conflictive\u2014since\nthe latter tend to look only to their personal concerns, at the\nexpense of the state\u2019s more general well-being\u2014this\nchapter, at least, urges a more constructive relationship between\nthem.\n3. The Early Imperial Era\n\nIn 221 BCE the king of the state of Qin vanquishes his final rival and\ndeclares himself the First Emperor, inaugurating both the Qin dynasty\nand China\u2019s imperial era. The First Emperor\u2019s success was\nfounded in part on his adherence to social and political ideas akin to\nthose in the Book of Lord Shang, and he endeavors to extend\nsocio-political standardization and control in unprecedented ways in\nthe new empire. The Qin dynasty does not long outlive its founder, but\nit is followed by the four-century-long Han dynasty in which many of\nkey characteristics of imperial Chinese state and society are first\nestablished. A lengthy period of disunity follows the collapse of the\nHan in 220 CE; over this period and through the succeeding Sui and\nTang dynasties, intellectuals focus less on social and political\nphilosophy than on issues of spiritual cultivation and abstract\nmetaphysics: in particular, this is the era when Chinese Buddhism\ncomes of age. While there certainly is socio-political thinking to be\nfound (see, for example, Chiu-Duke 2000) it makes sense to focus in\nthis section on the Han dynasty.\n\nIn the area of social and political philosophy, Han dynasty thinkers\nmake three main contributions. First of all, they seek to better\nunderstand and systematize their inheritance from the classical era.\nIn part they do this by editing and establishing standard editions of\nearlier texts; many of these now-classic texts take their current form\nat the hands of Han dynasty scholars. Another important aspect of this\nwork is establishing categories through which to understand the\nclassical era authors and debates. Distinctions among \u201cschools\n(jia)\u201d such as Confucian, Mohist, Standards\n(fajia, often translated as \u201cLegalist\u201d), and\nDaoist (daodejia) come from the efforts of Han scholars to\ndivide up earlier thinkers\u2019 approach to governance in particular\n(Csikszentmihalyi 2006: xvii; Smith 2003). The second important\ncontribution during the Han dynasty lies at the intersection of\nthought and practice: rulers and the advisers implement a variety of\ninstitutions aimed at realizing socio-political goals that rest on a\nsynthesis of classical thinking. That is, notwithstanding the efforts\nto distinguish various classical schools of thought, much Han thought\nand practice was highly synthetic, seeking to harmonize the insights\nof all schools. This meant building a state that rests on laws and\nother \u201cstandards\u201d as well as on rituals and on the ethical\ncharacters of the rulers. Han emperors establish central educational\ninstitutions and initiate the practice of bringing talented scholars\ninto the government via examination (albeit at a much smaller scale\nthan in the later Neo-Confucian era).\n\nThe third contribution of Han thinkers is their individual\nphilosophizing about the ways that state and society should be\norganized and fit into the larger cosmos; we will briefly consider\nthree examples. Jia Yi (200\u2013168 BCE) was a statesman and thinker\nwhose eclectic philosophizing was emblematic of his era. He is best\nknown, though, for his \u201cConfucian\u201d-sounding ethical and\npolitical writings. For example, he carefully articulates the ways\nthat a crown prince should be educated, living alongside scrupulously\ncorrect people so as to acquire a correct \u201csecond nature\u201d,\njust as one acquires one\u2019s mother tongue. As the prince matures,\nhe must be open to the realities of the world and to his own\nfallibility: Jia prescribes that \u201cWooden boards are erected, on\nwhich people might censure his actions. He is subject to the drum of\nremonstrance\u201d (HCT pp. 12\u201313). Jia elaborates on the\nimplied vision of socio-political order in another essay, arguing that\nwhile the common people must be punished when they violate standards\nsuch as laws, high officials are accountable to ritual and ethics\nrather than public law. These latter methods enable the cultivation of\na sense of shame, an internal moral compass, which in turn will enable\nofficials to learn from public remonstration\u2014which is explicitly\nlegitimate\u2014and to adjudicate wisely in law courts (HCT, pp.\n36\u20137).\n\nAnother feature of Han socio-political thought is an emphasis on\n\u201cnon-action (wuwei)\u201d. The term is best-known from\nthe Dao De Jing, although the term and, more broadly, the\ngeneral ideal of non-purposive, spontaneous action is widespread in\nWarring States thought (Slingerland 2003). In the Han we see it\nadapted to many different approaches to governance. The Utopian vision\nthat lies at the heart of the Dao De Jing (on at least one\ncommon reading) is still present, but more common is a synthesis of\nritual or legal standards with the idea of non-action. For example,\none official recommends what he takes to have been the approach of the\nearly sage kings, which was that \u201cIn making laws and edicts,\nthey made sure [those laws and edicts] accorded with human\ndispositions and only then put them into effect\u201d (HCT, p. 60).\nIn this way, people follow the laws naturally, needing no overt\nintervention on the part of the state. Texts that brought together an\nemphasis on overt standards and ideas like non-action are widespread;\nin fact, the earliest extant commentaries on the Dao De Jing\nare included as chapters\u2014likely added to the text in the\nHan\u2014of the Han Feizi, which as we saw above is the\nepitome of standards-based governance.\n\nFinally, many thinkers in the Han stress the ways in which human\nactivity fits into and is even shaped by cosmological processes and\npatterns. Here is an example of such a naturalistic justification of\nthe political order:\n\n\nThe five phases each move according to its place in the\nsequence\u2026. This is the reason that wood rules life, metal rules\ndeath, fire rules heat, and water rules cold. Human beings have no\nchoice but to go by their sequence, and officials have no choice but\nto go by their abilities. (HCT, p. 178)\n\n\nIn such a context astronomical and other portents take on significant\npolitical roles, though the Han also had famous skeptics like Wang\nChong (27 CE\u2013100 CE) who denied their importance. All in all, we\ncan say that the Han bequeathed to China a normative vision\nemphasizing socio-political harmony, even including harmony with the\ncosmos, that has room for various objective standards alongside\nimportant roles played by virtuous rulers and ministers.\n4. The Neo-Confucian Era\n\nThe Neo-Confucian era begins in the early Song dynasty, which itself\nis founded in 960 CE. A combination of social and political changes\ncreate fertile ground for new socio-political theorizing. The key\nmarker of social status in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) had been\none\u2019s pedigree, and the society was organized around something\nclose to a state-sponsored aristocracy. Seeking its own legitimacy,\nthe leaders of the new Song dynasty settled on a partnership with a\ntransformed elite class, now based more in education and claims of\nmerit than in ancestry. Instead of official families, the elite become\na \u201ccommunity of the educated\u201d; Song society is far more\nliterate and published than its Tang predecessor, and scholars\ngenerally refer to the new elite as the \u201cliterati\u201d (Bol\n2008: 31\u20139). In this fertile soil, the idea that literati should\nreflect on the Way and seek to influence their society took root and\ngrew.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, a range of scholars argued for two,\nclosely linked theses concerning the relation of Neo-Confucians to\nimperial power. The first was the Autocracy Thesis, according to which\nimperial power began to grow in the Song dynasty, eventually reaching\ndespotic levels in later dynasties. The second was the Inward-Turn\nThesis, which held that Neo-Confucians largely abdicated from\nengagement in political affairs, especially after the loss of northern\nChina (Liu 1988). In recent decades, though, new scholarship has shown\nquite convincingly that ministerial and literati power remain\nsignificant throughout the Song, and that Neo-Confucians remain\npolitically engaged (Bol 2008: 119; Levey 1991: 545f). The nature of\nthe political engagement does change, however. Rather than seeing\nNeo-Confucians as simply advocating an inward turn, it is more\naccurate to see them as often favoring a localist, decentralized\napproach to governance. Among other things, they come to see non-state\nspaces as extremely important to successful change at wider levels of\nthe state. This is not to say that Neo-Confucians abandon efforts to\neducate, direct, and serve the emperor, and strong emperors early in\nthe Ming and Qing dynasties manage to bring the focus back to\nthemselves for periods of time. Overall, though, the emphasis of\nNeo-Confucian theories of governance is nicely captured in the modern\nslogan \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d.\n\nAccording to Neo-Confucians, institutions of governance operate on two\nlevels simultaneously, one socio-political and the other personal. At\nthe socio-political level, they are concerned with the practicalities\nof keeping order in a large state filled with imperfect people. At the\npersonal level they are concerned with an individual\u2019s moral\ncharacter. Someone might think that operations on these two levels\nwork at cross-purposes, because crafting good institutions and\npolicies requires that we take human imperfections into account, and\nyet a full commitment to improving one\u2019s character requires that\nwe rise above these imperfections. Neo-Confucians disagree. For them,\nthe continuity of the socio-political with the personal received its\ncanonical expression in a passage from the classical Greater\nLearning:\n\n\nWanting to light up the bright virtue of all in the world, the\nancients first put their states in order. Those who wanted to put\ntheir states in order first regulated their families. Those who wanted\nto regulate their families first cultivated their selves. Those who\nwanted to cultivate their selves first rectified their heartminds.\nThose who wanted to rectify their heartminds first made their\nintentions sincere. Those who wanted to make their intentions sincere\nfirst reached understanding. Reaching understanding lies in\ninvestigating things. (Greater Learning 4)\n\n\nWe could understand the continuity described in this passage as a\ntemporally connected set of steps: first investigate things, then\nreach understanding, then make one\u2019s intentions sincere, and so\non, eventually putting one\u2019s state in order. But in fact the\nNeo-Confucians tend to see the steps as mutually constitutive:\ninvestigating things just is reaching understanding, families are\nregulated through the very act of personal cultivation, and having\norderly families is part of what it means for a state to be in order.\nThe implicit relationship between personal cultivation and\nsocio-political order is captured in the frequently used slogan\n\u201cinner sage-outer king\u201d: ethics and governance are two\nsides of the same coin. In other words, socio-political order entails\nthe ethical transformation of people in the state, as well as their\nleaders; in the language of the text, this is to \u201clight up the\nbright virtue of all in the world\u201d.\n\nWith virtually no exceptions, Neo-Confucians accepted hereditary\nmonarchy as their form of government. This does not mean that all\nmonarchs automatically enjoyed full legitimacy, however. Already in\nthe latter half of the Tang dynasty, Confucian and Buddhist scholars\nhad begun to claim that the proper moral or spiritual teaching was\npassed on in a genealogical fashion (Wilson 1995). Han Yu\n(768\u2013824) famously asserted that this transmission of the\nConfucian \u201cWay\u201d had been lost for many centuries; Northern\nSong progenitors of Neo-Confucianism argued that it was only in their\ngeneration that the Way had been recovered. In other words, legitimate\nsuccession from one monarch to another did not assure that individual\nrulers\u2014or even their dynasty as a whole\u2014were following the\nWay. Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200) gives this idea its most influential\nformulation when he says that the \u201csuccession of the Way\n(daotong)\u201d comes to those who are able to grasp the\ndeep truths embedded in the classics by the early sages. According to\nthis view, the earliest sages both grasped the Way and ruled, but over\ntime rulers lost this tie to the moral Way. A few great teachers like\nConfucius and Mencius understood the Way and tried to steer their\nsocieties in the right direction, even though they were not rulers,\nbut eventually the succession of the Way was lost until it was\nrecovered, says Zhu Xi, by the Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao\n[1032\u20131085] and Cheng Yi [1033\u20131107]).\n\nThe idea that the succession of the Way can come apart from the more\nsuperficial succession of monarchy has a number of important\nimplications, especially when combined with the view of governance\noperating at two levels (maintaining social order and achieving moral\ntransformation). Borrowing a term from classical antiquity,\nNeo-Confucians argue that a ruler who is successful at keeping order\nbut who falls short of achieving broader transformation is a mere\n\u201chegemon\u201d rather than a true \u201cking\u201d. It is\nbetter to be a hegemon than a cruel tyrant, to be sure, but even the\nsuccessful hegemon still needs to aspire to something greater. The\ngatekeepers to these greater achievements, meanwhile, are those\nscholars who have attained the succession of the Way. According to\nthis manner of thinking, therefore, monarchs must accept that leaders\nof the literati should be their teachers or even co-rulers, or that\nthe monarch\u2019s central authority should be reined in so that\nmorally cultivated literati can hold sway over local affairs. Over the\nNeo-Confucian period literati had varying degrees of success in\nasserting authority derived from the succession of the Way.\n4.1 Factions and Political Independence\n\nWilliam de Bary, one of the most influential Western scholars of\nNeo-Confucianism, has said an important \u201ctrouble with\nConfucianism\u201d is that it imposed tremendous moral demands on the\nConfucian superior person (junzi) without providing the\npolitical power to fulfill them. The superior person shoulders the\nresponsibility of cultivating humane monarchs and fashioning social\nand political institutions that work for the public weal, but\nConfucians are also committed to a system that gives superior people\nvery little leverage with which to accomplish these herculean tasks.\nThey deprive themselves of this leverage in various ways, some of them\nobvious (Confucianism embraces powerful and largely unchecked\nmonarchical government) and some of them subtle. One of the ways of\nundermining Confucians\u2019 own power is by refusing to pander to\nspecific constituencies or factions, standing on the side of the right\nand the public good rather than with allies or friends of convenience.\nTheir weakness, de Bary argues, is\n\n\nin their indisposition or inability to establish any power base of\ntheir own.\u2026 [E]xcept on rare, momentary occasions, they faced\nthe state, and whoever controlled it in the imperial court, as\nindividual scholars unsupported by an organized party or active\nconstituency. (de Bary 1991: 49)\n\n\nIndeed, there is no question that the role of the Confucian minister\nis complex and often vexed. This section highlights one of its key\ndimensions.\n\nLet us start with some context. From late-classical times down into\nthe early Song, the term \u201cfaction\u201d (pengdang) was\ninvariably derogatory, referring to associations of \u201cpetty\npeople\u201d who aimed to use their roles in government to further\ntheir own, selfish ends. There is a certain degree of support for this\nunderstanding of \u201cfaction\u201d in even earlier texts, but it\nis significant for our purposes that some passages in early texts like\nConfucius\u2019s Analects also suggest that superior people\n(junzi) can form associations, so long as they do not act in\npartisan ways (Levine 2008: 25\u20136 and 34\u20135; LY 12:24). A\nkey question that emerges in the midst of the political and\nintellectual wrangling of the Northern Song is whether horizontal\naffiliations among equals are in any way appropriate, or whether the\nonly axis of loyalty is the vertical one, from individuals upward to\nthe ruler (and beyond, to the Way or to cosmic Pattern\ntianli]).\n\nWe can identify three different positions on this question. The most\ncommon is the long-held view that factions and factionalism are the\nexclusive domains of the self-centered; superior people, in contrast,\nare individually loyal. The radical alternative to this was the claim,\nmade most forcefully by Ouyang Xiu (1007\u20131072), that genuine\nfactions\u2014which he understands as long-lasting associations\norganized collectively to pursue the common good\u2014are only formed\nby superior people. The affiliations of petty people are only\ntemporary, for personal gain (Levine 2008: 47\u201356; Ouyang\u2019s\nessay is translated in de Bary and Bloom 1999). Crucially, Ouyang adds\nthat genuinely superior people will unite around a shared Way\n(tongdao), so disputatiousness at the ruler\u2019s court is\ninevitably seen as sign of self-centeredness. Finally, a third\nposition agrees with the first in using \u201cfaction\u201d as a\nterm for selfish associations that ignore the common good, but agrees\nwith the second view that superior people can and should collaborate\nwith one another for their mutual edification: \u201cWhen superior\npeople cultivate themselves and regulate their heartminds, their Way\nis one of collaboration with others\u201d (Levine 2008: 58). So,\naccording to this third position, while superior people should not\nengage in factional wrangling at court, they should work together to\ncultivate themselves and pursue the common good.\n\nWhat, then, should be done about factions in practice, and about\nministerial disagreement more generally? Again, there are three main\npositions. Those who believe that superior people should be\nindividually loyal tend to argue that the ruler should try to wipe out\nall factions. One strong argument for this view maintains that even if\nthere is a faction of superior people, they will be outnumbered by\nfactions of the selfish; factionalism itself is destructive, so should\nbe rooted out (Levine 2008: 46\u20137). Ouyang Xiu\u2019s radical\nview holds that the true faction of superior people can be identified\nas such, and their one voice\u2014which, after all, is unified around\npursuit of the common good\u2014should be heeded. False factions of\npetty people should be suppressed. The third view, finally,\nacknowledges that factionalism seems inevitable and calls for a strong\nand wise ruler who is able to encourage vertical loyalty and to judge\namong the competing ministerial arguments. By relying on the ruler in\nthis way, this third view is able consistently to maintain that\nsuperior people need not themselves form ministerial factions, even\nthough they should collaborate to encourage mutual ethical\ndevelopment.\n\nIn his own day, Ouyang Xiu\u2019s radical view fails to win out, but\nover time the idea that there is one genuine faction becomes\nwidespread within Neo-Confucianism. Zhu Xi encourages his\ncontemporaries to support the formation of such a \u201cfaction of\nsuperior people\u201d, to join it themselves, and even to see that\nthe emperor himself becomes part of this faction. For Zhu, it is this\nfaction of superior people\u2014those who have grasped the\n\u201csuccession of the Way\u201d\u2014who have the ultimate\nlegitimacy in society, thus even the emperor needs to be properly\neducated so that he can strive to join this group. Zhu is also\nexplicit that it is crucial to maintain the ethical purity of those in\nthe faction; \u201cif there are those who are wicked and evil, then\nyou ought to expel them completely\u201d (WJ vol. 21, p. 1244).\nSimilar views can be found among the leaders of\nNeo-Confucianism\u2019s most famous faction, the Donglin. This\nlate-Ming dynasty movement is multi-faceted, including a broad ethical\nrevitalization movement, a national Confucian \u201cmoral\nfellowship\u201d, and a ministerial faction in Beijing; the whole\nmovement takes its name from its institutional base in the privately\nfunded Donglin Academy in southern China (Dardess 2002). The Donglin\nfaction goes to extreme lengths to promote its cause, driven by its\nmembers\u2019 conviction that theirs is a battle of the good and\npublic-spirited against the evil and self-centered. Donglin partisans\ncontribute to a toxic political atmosphere in which each side\ndemonizes its opponents. The crucial moment in the struggle comes when\na Donglin figure issues a public document explicitly accusing a\nleading palace figure of gross immorality. In a modern scholar\u2019s\nwords, this document is written in the \u201clanguage of moral\nterrorism\u201d: language that is uncompromising, \u201cheated to\nthe highest possible degree of emotional incandescence\u201d (Dardess\n2002: 71). Not long after this comes a violent backlash in which key\nDonglin figures are arrested, tortured, and killed, the academy razed,\nand the movement crushed.\n\nReflecting on Neo-Confucian ideas of faction, three observations are\nin order. First, returning to de Bary\u2019s conception of the\n\u201ctrouble with Confucianism\u201d with which we began this\nsection, Neo-Confucian principles make it difficult for proper\nConfucian ministers to establish a power-base of their own, in part\nbecause they are not supposed to have special commitments or loyalties\nto groups. Second, even if the primary axis of loyalty is vertical (to\nthe emperor, public good, and more abstract notions like the Way),\nhorizontal solidarity fits very well with key aspects of Neo-Confucian\nviews of self-cultivation, such as the part that one\u2019s community\nplays in developing an ethical \u201ccommitment\u201d. In this\nlight, and given the excesses to which the \u201cone true\nfaction\u201d view can lead, it is tempting to conclude that the\nthird view of factions described above is most attractive. Finally,\nrecent scholars have disagreed about the significance of Neo-Confucian\nviews of faction. One opines that\n\n\nhad Confucian gentry been able to transmit their local influence to\nthe provincial and national levels through legitimized factional\norganizations such as the Donglin academy, it is interesting to\nspeculate what sorts of political forces would have been released into\nConfucian political culture;\n\n\nhe goes on to suggest a parallel to \u201cthe trend against\nabsolutist monarchy and toward parliamentary rule in the West\u201d\n(Elman 1989: 389). In contrast, another scholar argues that\n\n\nthe Donglin affair was no harbinger of some possible future\nparliamentarian democracy. Donglin Confucian thought was monarchical\nand authoritarian to its core. (Dardess 2002: 7)\n\n4.2 Institutional vs. Character-centered Theories of Governance\n\nMost basically, China\u2019s governmental structure in the\nNeo-Confucian era has four parts: (1) the emperor, imperial family,\nand inner-court attendants like eunuchs; (2) the outer-court\nministers, bureaucracy, and the literati families who staff them; (3)\nthe common people; and (4) the institutions that help to shape the\nways in which (1)\u2013(3) interact. One of the great debates of the\nNeo-Confucian era is about the relative importance or priority of\ninstitutions. This debate takes on many guises, but at bottom is the\nsense that there is a tension between two ways of understanding the\nstructure that undergirds a well-ordered society. One sees\ninstitutions and their component parts (traditions, rules, and\nregulations, etc.) as more fundamental. The other sees the people who\ndirect and belong to the institutions, and particularly the character\nof such people (understood as a combination of talents and ethical\ndispositions), as more fundamental. Where a philosopher stands on this\nissue can help to explain how they align on other critical issues in\nmatters of governance. Those who tend to see institutions as more\nfundamental are more inclined to see legal and regulatory reform as\nthe primary way of addressing large-scale problems. Those who see the\ncharacter of people as more fundamental often think the solution to\nsuch problems lies in moral cultivation and transformation (in\nparticular, of the emperor himself). To a certain extent, the former\nthink that institutions should be designed to take human flaws and\nshortcomings into account, so that the state does not require large\nnumbers of people to be virtuous in order to create social order,\nwhile the latter tend to worry that institutions designed for flawed\npeople will, at least at certain levels, inhibit the kind of\nself-improvement that makes government truly transformative. For ease\nof reference, let us use the term \u201ccharacter-centered\u201d and\n\u201cinstitutionalist\u201d to refer to these two positions.\n\nOn one somewhat simplistic historical account, most Neo-Confucians\nadvocate a character-centered theory of politics, holding that ethical\ncultivation of people and not institutional reform is the most\nplausible means of restoring social order. This is supposedly what\nprecipitated the \u201cInward Turn\u201d described above,\nencouraging individuals to abandon interest in state governance and\nfocus instead on their own moral self-improvement. This version of\nhistory is not entirely misleading. Neo-Confucians of the Southern\nSong frequently blame the fall of the Northern Song on its failed\nexperiments in institutional reform, especially those of the\ninstitutionalist thinker and statesman Wang Anshi (1021\u20131086).\nAnd the most famous Neo-Confucian philosophers tended to make\npronouncements more consistent with the character-centered theory,\nincluding the Cheng brothers, Zhu Xi, and Wang Yangming.\n\nBut the truth is quite a bit more complicated, and more\nphilosophically interesting. From the Song dynasty all the way through\nthe Qing, the Neo-Confucians counted among their ranks many thinkers\ninterested in \u201cstatecraft (jingshi)\u201d. By the late\nMing dynasty and thereafter, \u201cstatecraft\u201d came to describe\nalmost any method or techniques that could be used for the practical\noperations of the state, construed so expansively as to include\nmathematics and history. But in the narrower sense common among\nearlier Neo-Confucians, it refers to a philosophical position that\naims to address social problems through institutional reform rather\nthan through dramatic transformations of character. Scholars sometimes\ndescribe these thinkers as belonging to a \u201cStatecraft\nSchool\u201d which includes Song philosophers like Chen Liang\n(1143\u20131194) and Ye Shi (1150\u20131223), and the Ming\nNeo-Confucian Wang Tingxiang (1474\u20131544) (Niu 1998; Tillman\n1982; Ong 2006). It also includes reform-minded Neo-Confucians who\nlived through the downfall of the Ming and the rise of the Qing\ndynasty, such as Gu Yanwu (1613\u20131682) and Huang Zongxi\n(1610\u20131695). Even for more character-centered Confucians, what\nit meant to say that people\u2019s character is more fundamental than\ninstitutions was open to debate.\n\nTo understand the nuances of the resulting debates, it helps to begin\nby recalling the classical Confucian philosopher Xunzi, famous as a\ndefender of the character-centered view; as noted above, he holds that\n\u201cThere are people who create order; there are no standards\ncreating order of themselves\u201d. Discoursing on Xunzi\u2019s\nclaim gives Neo-Confucians opportunities to develop new ways of\nexplaining how the character of people can be prior to institutions.\nOne crucial elaboration is made by Hu Hong (1106\u20131161). On\nHu\u2019s view, people enter into the explanatory order of governance\nat two levels: first, they are the ones who implement the rules and\nregulations. At this level Hu\u2019s analysis closely follows\nXunzi\u2019s, stressing the necessary vagueness of law and the need\nto have skillful magistrates who understand individual laws in a\nsystematic way. But secondly, the people are also the ones who fix the\nrules whenever the rules are not suited to the circumstances. That is,\nhumans govern not just as executives but as originators too:\n\n\nXunzi said, \u201cThere are people who create order; there are no\nstandards that create order\u201d. I humbly submit that we illustrate\nthis by drawing an analogy between wanting to restore order after a\nperiod of chaos, and trying to cross a river or lake [by boat]. The\nrules are like the boat and the people [i.e. the ruler and his\nofficials] are like the steersman. If the boat is damaged and the\nrudder is broken, then even if [the steersman] has seemingly divine\ntechnique everyone nevertheless understands that the boat cannot get\nacross. So whenever there is a period of great disorder it is\nnecessary to reform the rules. There has never been a case where one\ncould successfully restore order without reforming the rules. (HHJ pp.\n23\u201324)\n\n\nIn short, for Hu, people bear credit for successful governance not\njust by guiding the institution correctly, but also by creating and\nmodifying the very rules on which governance is founded. Credit goes\nnot just to the steersmen but to the shipwrights as well.\n\nAlthough human discretion may allow people of talent and good\ncharacter to update rules or apply them differently in different\ncontexts, they also allow people who lack talent and good character to\nmisuse them. In these cases, it helps to set limits to abuses of\nauthority and leadership by requiring that leaders adhere to rules.\nThe philosopher who argues for this view most forcefully is Huang\nZongxi, who lived in the late Ming and early Qing. In a remarkable\nessay titled \u201cOn Standards (Yuanfa)\u201d, Huang\nmaintains that we should distinguish between legitimate and\nillegitimate standards, where the illegitimate ones are distinguished\nby the fact that they are created or modified primarily to serve the\ninterests of rulers. Huang says that what gives rules legitimacy is\nthe purpose for which they are fashioned, not just tradition or the\nduty to respect the ancestors who fashioned them. When rules are\ndesigned with the interests of the people in mind they tend to be\nloose and open-ended, for their purpose is not just to control human\nbehavior but also to cultivate virtues. People are more likely to\ndevelop virtuous character traits if their orderly conduct is done\nwillingly rather than under threat, and they are more likely to act\nwillingly if they are brought up under a regime of rules that protects\ntheir interests. Ironically, it is the rules of self-serving\nauthorities that require greater and greater stringency. Because they\nrely heavily on coercion and work against the welfare of ordinary\npeople, the policy makers have to create one layer of rules that\ngovern human conduct, then a second layer of rules establishing\ninstitutions to enforce the first, then a third layer of rules to\nenforce those in the second, and so on. The result is a regime with\nconsiderably less flexibility and room for human discretion than the\nproponents of the Xunzian principle envision (YF p. 317).\n4.3 Final Thoughts\n\nAccording to most Neo-Confucians, revering the emperor meant both\nritual respect for the role of the emperor and obedience to the\nlegitimate authority of the emperor, but not unthinking loyalty to the\nruler no matter what he might do or say. Ultimate loyalty is owed to\nno individual but to the Way, which Neo-Confucians also discuss in\nterms of \u201ccosmic Pattern (tianli)\u201d\u2014that is,\nthe ultimate harmony of all things. Neo-Confucians lived in a public\nculture in which it was expected, at least in principle, that\nministers show their loyalty by courageously pointing out flaws and\nremonstrating with their rulers. And many Neo-Confucians, including\nZhu Xi, quietly or reluctantly acknowledged that there are cases when\none should not obey one\u2019s emperor, presumably after all attempts\nto dissuade the misguided ruler had been exhausted (Schirokauer 1978:\n141\u201343). We already saw some of this in the Donglin incident,\ndiscussed above; there are numerous other cases in which ministers,\neither individually or as a group, seek to upbraid or reform an errant\nruler. Often these disputes revolved around ritual matters, since the\nstability of human relationships as expressed through ritual was\ncentral to the overall harmony of the society and cosmos. Throughout\nmuch of the Neo-Confucian era political actors also find it necessary\nto justify their proposals through reference to classical texts, which\none contemporary scholar has therefore argued serve a partly\n\u201cconstitutional\u201d role (Song 2015). Notwithstanding the\nvarious ways in which literati can partly constrain the choices of\nrulers, though, there is little question that the power of rulers\nremains paramount. And while the deep-seated belief that harmony\nrelies on the well-being of the people is no doubt responsible for the\npeasantry living better lives than they might have otherwise, in the\nend Neo-Confucian socio-political thought grants them only one\npolitical outlet: revolt (Angle 2009: ch. 10).\n5. The Modern Era\n\nThe last years of the Qing dynasty, which collapsed in 1911, were\nmarked by a flourishing of political thought under the twin stimuli of\ndomestic challenges and encounters with foreign political\nphilosophies. The Russian Revolution of 1917 added further fuel to the\nfire, at a time when the nascent Republic of China was struggling with\nboth internal and external threats. The nature and sources of\npolitical authority once again were topics of debate. Many now took it\nfor granted that the goal was some sort of \u201cdemocracy\u201d in\nwhich the people were (at least in principle) sovereign. But who\ncounted as \u201cthe people\u201d, how they were to be led or\nrepresented, and how collective versus individual goals were to be\nbalanced all were up for grabs. At a broader level, there was a debate\nbetween those who felt the answer lay in one or another\n\u201cism\u201d\u2014that is, an all-encompassing ideology like\nMarxism\u2014and those who favored working more pragmatically, via\ninstitution building, on one \u201cproblem\u201d at a time. A few\ndecades later, after the founding of the People\u2019s Republic,\nsimilar issues were addressed in the contrast between\n\u201cRed\u201d (ideologically and morally pure) and\n\u201cexpert\u201d (possessing technical expertise). In various\nways, these twentieth-century debates resonated with classical and\nNeo-Confucian contention between insitutional and character-centered\ntheories of governance. Were morally advanced individuals the key to\nan ideal society? Or should objective standards of success, coupled\nwith objective institutions, be society\u2019s political foundation?\nIn cases of conflict, which had priority?\n\nThere was certainly no single answer offered to these questions by any\nof the groups making up twentieth-century China\u2019s political\nlandscape, ranging from \u201cNew Confucians\u201d to nationalists\nto liberals to Marxists. However, the \u201cisms\u201d approach won\nout through much of the century, and Thomas Metzger has shown that\nChinese political thinkers of all camps tended toward what he calls\n\u201cepistemological optimism\u201d, which is a confidence that the\none, universally applicable moral and political truth is knowable, and\nso great authority should be vested in those gifted individuals able\nto perceive this truth (Metzger 2005). Another way to put this would\nbe to say that there is a strong Utopian strand in much\ntwentieth-century Chinese political thought, which has both pushed\ntoward radical solutions and led to dissatisfaction with continued\ndissonance or piecemeal progress. Even Chinese liberals have, in many\ncases, envisioned harmonious societies in which individual\nself-realization goes hand-in-hand with the realization the larger\ncollectivity, which they often called the \u201clarger self\n(dawo)\u201d (Zarrow 2021).\n\nSome philosophers in the twentieth century have been more aware than\nothers of the problems with Utopianism. Mou Zongsan (1909\u20131995),\na leader of the new Confucian movement, was not only aware of it, but\nalso offered a particularly creative way out of the recurrent tension\nbetween personal virtue (or morality) and public standards (or\npolitics). Mou\u2019s insight is that the relation between morality\nand politics is \u201cdialectical\u201d. Rather than seeing a\nleader\u2019s political virtue as a direct extension of his or her\npersonal, moral virtue, Mou argues that there needs to be an indirect\nrelation between them. Politics and political virtue must develop out\nof morality, but nonetheless have an independent, objective existence.\nThis means that human rights, for example, must have a basis in\nmorality, but come to be measured by standards that are separate from\nmoral standards. The converse is also true: full moral virtue requires\nthat which partly \u201crestricts itself (ziwo\nkanxian)\u201d, namely objective structure (Mou 1991: 59).\nObjective structures (like laws) are fundamentally different from the\nsubjectively-felt, internalized morality after which we should all\nindividually strive. The concrete implication of this is that no\nmatter what one\u2019s level of moral accomplishment,\n\n\ninsofar as one\u2019s virtue is manifested in politics, one cannot\noverride the relevant limits (that is, the highest principles of the\npolitical world), and in fact must devote one\u2019s august character\nto the realization of these limits. (Mou 1991: 128)\n\n\nIn short, sages cannot break the law or violate the constitution.\nPolitics thus has its independence from morality.\n\nPhilosophers have differed in their evaluations of Mou\u2019s\nargument, but it can stand as an instance of the continuing creativity\nto be found in contemporary Chinese political thinking (Angle 2012).\nChina\u2019s dynamic society offers a crucible within which new ideas\nand new political forms may be forged and tested in coming years. To\nbe sure, genuinely novel and intellectually challenging ideas do not\nform the majority of contemporary Chinese political discourse, but\nthey are nonetheless present across the entire political spectrum. It\nremains to be seen whether robust political values and institutions\nwill emerge as alternatives to models with which Western political\ntheorists are familiar, just as we cannot yet foresee what role the\nMarxist, Confucian, liberal, and other traditions will play in future\nChinese political thinking. Concerns with harmony and virtue are\nunlikely to disappear, but (as Mou\u2019s example shows) this by no\nmeans limits the future interest of whatever political institutions\nand theories emerge in China.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Texts", "Secondary Texts"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Texts": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cell-rl cellpad-small-dense vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "[DDJ]", "<em>Dao De Jing</em>; see the entry on\n <a href=\"../laozi/\">Laozi</a>.\n</tr>\n<tr>", "[GL]", "<em>Greater Learning</em>: for a translation, see Wing-tsit\nChan, <em>A Sourcebook in Chinese Philosophy</em>, Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press, 1963. </tr>\n<tr>", "[GZ]", "<em>Guanzi</em>; for a translation see W.
