Rejections of informational concepts in biology\nSome biologists and philosophers have argued that the introduction\nof informational and semantic concepts has had a bad effect on\nbiology, that it fosters various kinds of explanatory illusions and\ndistortions, perhaps along with ontological confusion. Here we will\nsurvey some of the more emphatic claims of this kind, but some degree\nof unease can be detected in many other discussions (see, for example,\nGriesemer 2005).\nThe movement known as Developmental Systems Theory (DST) has often\nopposed the mainstream uses of informational concepts in biology,\nlargely because of the idea that these concepts distort our\nunderstanding of the causal processes in which genes are involved. For\na seminal discussion, see Oyama (1985), and also Lehrman (1970);\nGriffiths and Gray (1994); Griffiths and Neumann-Held (1999). These\ntheorists have two connected objections to the biological use of\ninformational notions.  One is the idea that informational models are\npreformationist. Preformationism, in its original form, in effect\nreduces development to growth: within the fertilized egg there exists\na miniature form of the adult to come. Preformationism does not\nexplain how an organized, differentiated adult develops from a much\nless organized and more homogeneous egg; it denies the phenomenon.\nDST\u2019s defenders suspect that informational models of development\ndo the same. In supposing, for example, that instructions for a\n\u201clanguage organ\u201d are coded in the genome of a new-born\nbaby, you do not explain how linguistic abilities can develop in an\norganism that lacks them, and you foster the illusion that no such\nexplanation is necessary. (See Francis 2003 for a particularly\nvigorous version of the idea that the appeal to information leads to\npseudo-explanation in biology.)\nSecond, DST theorists have often endorsed a \u201cparity\nthesis\u201d: genes play an indispensable role in development, but so\ndo other causal factors, and there is no reason to privilege\ngene\u2019s contribution to development. This claim is often\nbuttressed by reference to Richard Lewontin\u2019s arguments for the\ncomplexity and context sensitivity of developmental interaction, and\nhis consequent arguments that we cannot normally partition the causal\nresponsibility of the genetic and the environmental contributions to\nspecific phenotypic outcomes (Lewontin 1974, 2000). DST theorists\nthink that informational models of genes and gene action make it very\ntempting to neglect parity, and to attribute a kind of\ncausal primacy to these factors, even though they are just\none of a set of essential contributors to the process in\nquestion. Once one factor in a complex system is seen in informational\nterms, the other factors tend to be treated as mere background, as\nsupports rather than bona fide causal actors. It becomes\nnatural to think that the genes direct, control, or organise\ndevelopment; other factors provide essential resources. But, the\nargument goes, in biological systems the causal role of genes is in\nfact tightly interconnected with the roles of many other factors\n(often loosely lumped together as \u201cenvironmental\u201d).\nSometimes a gene will have a reliable effect against a wide range of\nenvironmental backgrounds; sometimes an environmental factor will have\na reliable effect against a wide range of genetic\nbackgrounds. Sometimes both genetic and environmental causes are\nhighly context-sensitive in their operation. Paul Griffiths has\nemphasised this issue, arguing that the informational mode of\ndescribing genes can foster the appearance of\ncontext-independence:\n\nGenes are instructions\u2014they provide\ninformation\u2014whilst other causal factors are merely\nmaterial\u2026. A gay gene is an instruction to be gay even when\n[because of other factors] the person is straight. (Griffiths 2001:\n395\u201396)\nThe inferential habits and associations that tend to go along with\nthe use of informational or semantic concepts are claimed to lead us to think of\ngenes as having an additional and subtle form of extra causal\nspecificity. These habits can have an effect even when people are\nwilling to overtly accept context-dependence of (most) causes in\ncomplex biological systems. So DST theorists suggest that it is\nmisleading to treat genes and only genes as carrying\n\u201cmessages\u201d that are expressed in their effects. To say\nthis is almost inevitably to treat environmental factors as secondary\nplayers.\nThe parity thesis has been the focus of considerable discussion and\nresponse. In a helpful paper, Ulrich Stegmann shows that the parity\nthesis is really a cluster of theses rather than a single thesis\n(Stegmann 2012). Some ways of interpreting parity make the idea quite\nuncontroversial, as no more than an insistence on the complex and\ninteractive character of development, or as pointing to the fact that\njust as genes come in slightly different versions, with slightly\ndifferent effects (holding other factors constant), the same is true\nof nongenetic factors. Epigenetic markers on genes, due to nutritional\nenvironments, litter position and birth order, may also come in\nslightly different variants, with slightly different effects. Other\nversions of the claim are much more controversial.\nOne response to the parity thesis has been to accept the view that\ngenes are just one of a set of individually necessary and collectively\nsufficient developmental factors, but to argue nonetheless that genes\nplay both a distinctive and especially important role in development\n(Austin 2015; Lean 2014;\nPlaner 2014). As noted above, perhaps the most promising suggestion\nalong these lines is that genes exert a form of causal control over\ndevelopment that is universal, pervasive and fine-grained. Many\nfeatures of the phenotypes of every organism exist in an array of\nsomewhat different versions, as a result of allelic variation in\ncausally relevant genes. No other developmental factor exerts control\nthat is similarly universal, pervasive and fine-grained (Woodward\n2010; Stegmann 2014). Thus Stegmann illustrates Woodward\u2019s idea\nthat genes exert specific control over phenotypes by contrasting the\neffects of intervening on, say, the quantity of polymerase on cell\nactivity with intervening on the DNA template itself. Polymerase is\ncritically causally important, but varying its concentration will\nmodify the rate of synthesis, but not the sequences produced. That is\nnot true of modifications of the DNA sequence itself, so the DNA\nsequence is more causally specific than polymerase.\nShea takes a different approach, arguing that different causal\nfactors have different evolutionary histories. Some causal factors are\nsimply persisting features of the environment (gravity being one\nexample). Others are experienced by the developing organism as a\nresult of histories of selection. Burrows, for example, ensure that\neggs and nestlings develop in fairly constant temperature and\nhumidity. But burrows are not naturally selected inheritance\nmechanisms. They have not come into existence to ensure that a seabird\nchick resembles its parents. In contrast, some other developmental\nfeatures are present and act in development because of histories of\nselection in which the selective advantage is that these mechanisms\nhelp ensure parent-offspring similarity. Shea argues that genes,\nprobably epigenetic markings on genes, and perhaps a few other\ndevelopmental resources are shaped by this form of natural\nselection. So genes, and perhaps a few other developmental factors,\nplay a distinctive developmental role, even though many other factors\nare causally necessary (Shea 2011).\nIn sum then, there are good reasons to be cautious about the use of\ninformational terminology in thinking about development. But it is\nalso possible to over-estimate the strength of the connection between\ninformational conceptions of development and the idea that genes play\na uniquely important role in development. There are ways of defending\nthe idea that genes play a special role while acknowledging the\ninteractive character of development. Moreover, an ambitious use of\ninformational concepts is not confined to those within mainstream\nbiological thinking. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb defend quite\nheterodox views of inheritance and evolution, while basing key parts\nof their work\u2014including an advocacy of \u201cLamarckian\u201d\nideas\u2014around informational concepts (Jablonka and Lamb\n2005). They suggest that one of the useful features of informational\ndescriptions is that they allow us to generalize across different\nheredity systems, comparing their properties in a common currency. In\naddition, one of the present authors has used informational concepts\nto distinguish between the evolutionary role of genes from that of\nother inherited factors whilst demonstrating the evolutionary\nimportance of non-genetic inheritance (Sterelny 2004, 2011). So in\nvarious ways, an informational point of view may facilitate discussion\nof unorthodox theoretical options, including non-genetic mechanisms of\ninheritance.\n",
