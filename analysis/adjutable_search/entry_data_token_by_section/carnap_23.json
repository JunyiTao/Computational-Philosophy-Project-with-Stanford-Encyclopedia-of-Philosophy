    "main_text": "Inductive Logic and the Re-Emergence of the Theoretical Language || Confirmation\n8.1 Confirmation\n\nCarnap\u2019s first sketch of a linguistic framework (that of the\nAufbau) envisaged complete reducibility of all concepts by\nexplicit definition, at least in principle. By the time of\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d (1936\u201337), as we saw\nabove, Carnap had conceded that such definitional reducibility is not\nalways possible, and suggested various forms of incomplete\nreducibility that, while not employing only explicit definitions, at\nleast required of empirically meaningful sentences a clear grounding\nin observation. He considers verifiability as a criterion for\nempirical content or meaning, and rejects it for essentially the same\nreason as he had a decade previously (in Carnap 1926: 7\u20139). He\nalso considers Popper\u2019s falsifiability criterion, and rejects it\nbecause only sentences of a very particular logical form are\nfalsifiable at all (such as, e.g., \u201call swans are white\u201d).\nIndeed, most scientific theories (all theories that use limit\nconcepts, for instance) have to be stated using unbounded multiple\nmixed quantifiers, e.g., \u201cfor all x there is a\ny such that \\((\\ldots x \\ldots y\\ldots)\\)\u201d, and there\nare instances of such sentences which can neither be verified nor\nfalsified by a single observational counter-instance. In\nparticular, to falsify such a statement there would have to be a\ncounter-instance x to falsify an unbounded existentially\nquantified (empirical) sentence, which (as Popper himself\nacknowledged) is not generally possible. So in these cases, typical of\ntheoretical science, falsifiability has no advantage over\nverifiability. (For a more precise discussion of falsifiability, see\nSchurz & Dorn 1988.)\n\nCarnap therefore opts neither for verification nor for falsification,\nbut for a form of partial verification that he calls\n\u201cconfirmation\u201d:\n\n\nIf in the continued series of such testing experiments no negative\ninstance is found but the number of positive instances increases, then\nour confidence in the law will grow step by step. Thus, instead of\nverification, we may speak of gradually increasing\nconfirmation of the law. (TM1: 425)\n\n\nThe acceptance or rejection of a scientific hypothesis becomes\npartially a practical matter, and to some degree a matter of\nconvention. Carnap speaks in this connection of the \u201cdegree of\nconfirmation\u201d but means this not in a quantitative but merely\n\u201ctopological\u201d (what he would later call\n\u201ccomparative\u201d) sense. He specifically rejects\nReichenbach\u2019s proposal to equate degree of confirmation to\n\u201cthe degree of probability in the strict sense which this\nconcept has in the calculus of probability, i.e., as the limit of\nrelative frequency\u201d (TM1: 427). Five years later Carnap would\nrealize that the probability calculus could be given a different,\nepistemic interpretation as had been done historically by Bayes,\nLaplace, Pearson, and Keynes, and was now continued by Harold\nJeffreys\u2014and he would make that interpretation the basis of his\nremaining life\u2019s work of developing quantitative\nexplications of \u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d. (For more\ndetails on Carnap\u2019s work on confirmation and inductive logic,\nsee the supplement\n Inductive Logic.)\n",
