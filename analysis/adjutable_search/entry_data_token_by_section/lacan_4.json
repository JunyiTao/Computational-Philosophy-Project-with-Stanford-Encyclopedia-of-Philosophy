    "main_text": "Fundamental Concepts || Otherness, the Oedipus Complex, and Sexuation\n2.4 The Libidinal Economy\n\nFreud\u2019s metapsychology of the libidinal economy, of the\nunderlying motivational mechanisms of psychical life, is grounded on\nhis theory of drive (Trieb, and not Instinkt,\ndespite many English mistranslations of Trieb as\n\u201cinstinct\u201d). Lacan elaborates upon and extends this\nFreudian theoretical framework. In the process, he reworks some of\nFreud\u2019s concepts and adds other concepts of his own.\n2.4.1 Need-Demand-Desire and Castration\n\nNeed, demand, and desire form a conceptual-terminological triad in\nLacanian theory. Needs are biologically innate vital requirements for\nthe human being as a living organism. Humans are born saddled with\nsuch imperatives from the very start, although, as per Freudian\nHilflosigkeit, they are powerless on their own to satisfy\nthese bodily dictates for a protracted initial period lasting well\ninto childhood (see\n 2.2\n above).\n\nThe combination of being prematurationally helpless but having\nunavoidable needs means that, over the course of physical and mental\ndevelopment, the infant must come to articulate its needs to bigger\nothers. These others (as three-dimensional O/others along the lines of\nLacan\u2019s register theory\u2014see\n 2.3\n above) are addressed as those capable of assisting in the meeting and\nquelling of needs. Of course, crying, screaming, gesticulating, and\nthe like are early expressions of needs, being the fashions in which\ninfants prior to acquiring language per se alert the older individuals\naround them of their requirements. Even at this early stage, the\ninfant is forced to rely on his/her thus-addressed significant others\nto interpret the \u201cmeaning\u201d of his/her cries, screams, and\ngesticulations (\u201cAh, you\u2019re hungry,\u201d \u201cUh oh,\nthat means you\u2019re tired,\u201d \u201cSo, it\u2019s time to\nchange your diaper,\u201d etc.). Through these spontaneous\ninterpretations, others, whether knowingly or not, participate with\nthe pre-verbal child in shaping links between needs and the socially\nmediated significance of the expressions of needs. These others\nthereby lend the child\u2019s noises and movements the significance\nof being \u201cdemands,\u201d with this amounting to a kind of\nassistance provided over and above the assistance of meeting bare\nneeds themselves. Now, this is not to say that there are no natural\ncorrelations whatsoever between needs and their pre-verbal expressions\nhardwired into babies\u2019 behavioral repertoires. But, arguably,\ninfants are not immediately and automatically self-consciously aware\nof these correlations as such, with caretakers\u2019 responses being\nkey aids in helping the child become explicitly cognizant of\nneed-expression couplings.\n\nAs the infant continues maturing, soon acquiring language, the\ninfluences of others and Others (especially inter-subjective others as\nconveyors of the signs and signifiers of the big Other qua\ntrans-subjective symbolic order\u2014see\n 2.1.2\n and\n 2.3\n above) increasingly exert themselves on the forming of associative\nconnections between needs and demands. For example, as part of\nsocialization and education, parents typically begin to introduce the\ndiscipline of insisting that the child articulate his/her requirements\nand urges in specific manners (\u201cSay \u2018please\u2019 and\n\u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d \u201cAsk nicely,\u201d \u201cIn\nthis household, we do not yell when we\u2019re hungry,\u201d and so\non). The child learns that he/she must accept, internalize, and speak\n\u201cthe discourse of the Other\u201d (in this instance, the\nparents) in order to get his/her needs recognized, acknowledged, and\naddressed in a satisfactory fashion. In short, he/she must make\ndemands couched in terms and conventions imposed by O/others\u2019\nsocio-symbolic regimes. Lacan maintains that natural bodily needs\nhence, via the inter- and trans-subjective dynamics of demand, are\n\u201coverwritten\u201d by the signifiers of an ultimately Symbolic\nOtherness, an overwriting through which the bases of the libidinal\neconomy are denaturalized and subjected to socio-cultural forces and\nfactors. Much of this beds down in the young, nascent subject\u2019s\npsyche, thereafter exerting (often in unconscious ways) decisive\neffects on this person\u2019s libidinal economy throughout his/her\nlife.\n\nIn his 1958 \u00e9crit \u201cThe Signification of the\nPhallus,\u201d Lacan provides a succinct formula for defining\n\u201cdesire\u201d in relation to both need and demand. He\nstipulates that desire is what remains after need is subtracted from\ndemand. What, exactly, does this equation mean? Through being\ntranslated into demands, needs come to be saddled with surpluses of\nmore-than-biological significances; vital requirements take on the\nexcess baggage of meanings over and above the level of brute, simple\norganic survival. Largely by virtue of what O/others add to the\nchild\u2019s experiences of needs through superimposing\ninterpretations of these needs as socio-symbolic demands, the meeting\nof the child\u2019s needs in response to his/her demands makes these\nneeds into, first and foremost, litmus tests of where he/she stands in\nrelation to these thus-addressed significant O/others. Being given\nspecific items of food by a parent in response to a demand expressing\nhunger can indicate to the child not only that the parent understands\nthat a need to eat has to be met, but also, and more importantly, that\nhe/she is loved by the parent, that he/she enjoys a privileged\nposition in relation to the parent\u2019s attention and priorities.\nLacan therefore asserts that each and every demand is, at bottom, a\ndemand for love. Returning to the equation \u201cdemand \u2013 need\n= desire,\u201d what is desired when a demand is addressed to another\nis not so much the meeting of the thus-expressed need, but, in\naddition to this, the very love of another.\n\nParents of children are all too familiar with seemingly endless series\nof demands from the little ones (\u201cI want a sandwich,\u201d\n\u201cOK, here\u2019s a sandwich\u201d\u2026 \u201cI want a\nlollipop,\u201d \u201cOK, here\u2019s a lollipop\u201d\u2026\n\u201cI want a new toy,\u201d \u201cOK, here\u2019s a new\ntoy\u201d\u2026 and on and on until an exhausted parental\n\u201cNo\u201d is pronounced and wearily defended against vigorous\nprotests). Adults, whether parents or not, also are aware of a similar\ndesiring restlessness in themselves, an inability to acquire an object\nor attain a success that would be \u201cIT\u201d\n(with-a-capital-I-and-T), the final be-all-and-end-all telos\nof wanting and wishing satisfying them for good forever after.\nSimilarly, an adult in a romantic relationship never is content with\nbeing told that he/she is loved by the beloved only once; he/she\ninsists upon repetitions ad infinitum of the affirmation by\nthe significant other that, \u201cI love you\u201d (as if no\naffirmation is ever quite enough). With both children and adults,\nmargins of dissatisfaction, perpetually resurfacing itches that never\ncan be scratched just right, are to be explained, according to Lacan,\nthrough a clarification of the essence of the \u201clove\u201d\ndemanded in all demands in excessive addition to the gratification of\ncorresponding needs. What is being requested is an impossibility\nimpossible on the basis of the register-theoretic version of\nO/otherness \u00e0 la Lacanianism (see\n 2.1\n and\n 2.3\n above): the non-objectifiable negativity of the kinetic, slippery\nheart of Real Otherness (i.e., the always-on-the-move affection,\nfocus, etc. of the Real Other\u2019s desiring core both conscious and\nunconscious) being objectified as the positivity of a static, stable\nthing (i.e., a special object able to be gift-wrapped and handed over\nas part of the response to demand). Employing once again the example\nof hunger, while the O/other can respond to demands for food with the\nprovision of nourishing substances answering to the need for\nnourishment, he/she is constitutively incapable of turning the nucleus\nof his/her desiring being (i.e., the non-object of his/her\n\u201clove\u201d) into one tangible object among others to be\nbestowed along with food and the like. As will be discussed here\nshortly (see\n 2.4.3\n below), conscious and unconscious fantasies are aroused on the sides\nof desiring demanders\u2014and, everyone is a desiring\ndemander\u2014by the necessary, inevitable dissatisfactions\naccompanying desires. These fantasies cover over the impossibility of\nbringing desires to satisfying ends. They do so by constructing\nscenarios in which there is a yet-to-be-(re)obtained object that\nreally is \u201cIT.\u201d Moreover, in these fantasmatic scenarios,\nanswers to questions of Real Others\u2019 inscrutable desires\n(\u201cWhat does the Other want, and want specifically of me?\u201d)\nare staged.\n\nAs should be evident by now, the intervention of the signifiers of the\nsymbolic order (i.e., the discourses of big Others) is integral to the\ngenesis of the need-demand-desire triad. Through the intrusion of\nthese signifiers cutting into both the body and mind of the young\nchild, a proto-subjective being of need, passing through the demands\nof discipline (in both sense of the genitive), is transformed into a\nsubject of desire. Such a subject is\n\u201cbarred\u201d\u2014Lacan\u2019s matheme for the barred\nsubject of desire is $\u2014alienated from its natural needs and\nderailed onto the tracks of non-natural desires doomed never to reach\nenjoyable destinations. In connection with his revisions of the\nOedipus complex (see\n 2.3\n above), Lacan turns Freudian castration into \u201csymbolic\ncastration.\u201d The latter, rather than being a real or imagined\nscene in which a specific threat to bodily integrity is issued,\ndesignates the dual somatic and psychical discombobulating effects\nupon the premature human animal caused by insertion into and\nsubjection to surrounding socio-symbolic contexts, of being made to\ndepend on the foreignness of signifiers and everything they bring with\nthem.\n2.4.2 Drive and Jouissance\n\nIn Freud\u2019s drive theory, sublimation amounts to a drive finding\na means to secure satisfaction (Befriedigung) in the face of\n\u201caim-inhibition\u201d (i.e., a blockage of its prior path to an\nearlier aimed-at drive-object). But, as Lacan observes, Freud also\noddly defines the aim (Ziel) of any and every drive as\nsatisfaction. Therefore, how can a drive achieve satisfaction if its\naim (defined as the achievement of satisfaction) is inhibited?\nLacan\u2019s response to this apparent Freudian contradiction is to\nput forward a distinction between the aim and \u201cgoal\u201d of\nthe drive as a metapsychological entity: While the aim of a drive can\nbe and inevitably is inhibited, its (true) goal always is\nreached\u2014and this because its goal is nothing other than enjoying\nthe ceaseless movement of repetitively rotating around whatever\nblockages land on its path.\n\nAccording to a certain widely accepted reading appealing to the\nimmediately above (promoted by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek and the\nSlovenian School of Lacanian theory), Lacan distinguishes between\ndesire and drive. As seen (see\n 2.4.1\n above), an essential characteristic of desire is its restlessness,\nits ongoing agitated searching and futile striving. No object it gets\nits hands on is ever quite \u201cIT.\u201d Whereas desire is stuck\nwith its dissatisfied drifting from object to object and ever onward\n(in a structured movement akin to the \u201cspurious/bad\ninfinite\u201d as per Hegel), drive derives a perverse enjoyment from\nthis desire-fuelled libidinal circling around the vanishing point of\nthe impossible-qua-unattainable. There where desire is\nfrustrated, drive is gratified. Drive gains its satisfaction through\nvampirically feeding off of the dissatisfaction of desire.\n\nLike the register of the Real with which it is most closely\nassociated, jouissance, a notion that comes to the fore at\nthe end of the 1950s, is difficult to encapsulate in succinct defining\nformulas. By the end of Lacan\u2019s itinerary at the start of the\n1980s, this term had taken on a plethora of significations, dividing\nand sub-dividing into a wide array of distinct-but-related concepts.\nIn English-language Lacanian scholarship, jouissance almost\nalways is left untranslated, since its English equivalent,\n\u201cenjoyment,\u201d fails to capture the specifically sexual\nconnotations of the original French word.\n\nThe best way to begin getting a sense of what Lacan means by\njouissance is through reference to the Lacanian distinction\nbetween drive and desire (see\n 2.4.2\n above) in conjunction with select stipulations by Freud regarding the\ninfamous death drive (Todestrieb) of Freud\u2019s later dual\ndrive theory (first laid out in Beyond the Pleasure Principle\n(1920)). Like Freud\u2019s Todestrieb, Lacan\u2019s\njouissance is \u201cbeyond the pleasure principle\u201d\n(this being another reason why the English \u201cenjoyment,\u201d as\nsynonymous with pleasure, is an inappropriate translation). The\npost-1920 Freud muses that all drives might be said to be death\ndrives, meaning that each and every drive perhaps works, at least in\ncertain respects at certain times, contrary to the pursuit of the\npleasurable as balance, gratification, homeostasis, satisfaction, and\nso on. Along these same lines, the Lacanian drive extracts\n\u201cenjoyment\u201d from the thwartings and failures of desire;\nwhereas the latter is oriented by the tantalizingly elusive\ntelos of pleasure qua satisfaction, the former\ngenerates its jouissance-beyond-pleasure precisely through\nthe inhibiting of desire itself. The many possible sadistic and\nmasochistic implications of this side of the libidinal economy are not\ndifficult to imagine.\n\nOne of several clinical phenomena pushing Freud into dethroning the\npleasure principle in 1920 as the formerly hegemonic ruler of the\npsyche in its entirety is \u201crepetition compulsion\u201d\n(Wiederholungszwang)\u2014specifically, the psyche\u2019s\nperplexing, spontaneous compulsive repeating of that which is painful\nand/or traumatic (examples of this include post-traumatic disorders,\nso-called \u201cnegative therapeutic reaction,\u201d and the\nrecurrent types of self-defeats unconsciously arranged by neurotics\nfor themselves). One of the theoretical functions of the death drive\nis to account for whatever disregards or disrupts the reign of the\npleasure principle as a fundamental \u201claw\u201d of mental life.\nIn Lacan\u2019s conceptual apparatus, jouissance sometimes\nlikewise refers to an overriding force/tendency compelling repetitions\nof experiences or events upsetting the calm, delicate equilibrium of\npsychical subjectivity\u2019s Imaginary-Symbolic reality (hence the\nassociation of jouissance with the Real).\n\nIn the process of the neonate as a biological being acquiring both an\nego and a speaking subjectivity\u2014this involves the living\norganism being submitted to the mediating matrices of\nImaginary-Symbolic realities\u2014the human creature supposedly\nloses, through symbolic castration (see\n 2.4.1\n above), access to an immediate, undiluted jouissance in its\nraw, unmitigated intensities (whether this is an actual, factual\noccurrence in linear, chronological ontogeny or an\napr\u00e8s-coup, retrospective fantasy is a complicated\nissue in Lacanian theory). The jouissance presumably lost to\nthe speaking subject returns only in the guises of what might be\nlabeled \u201climit experiences,\u201d namely, encounters with that\nwhich is annihilating, inassimilable, overwhelming, traumatic, or\nunbearable. Similarly, jouissance, in this vein, is related\nto transgressive violations, the breaching of boundaries and breaking\nof barriers. It is difficult, if not impossible, for the\nparl\u00eatre to accommodate, tolerate, and digest. The\nspeaking being is forced to cohabitate uneasily with its always\nproblematic jouissance.\n2.4.3 Fantasy and Object a\n\nIn line with Freud\u2019s discussions of fantasizing in psychical\nlife, Lacan treats fantasies, particularly those functioning at the\nlevel of fundamental formations of the unconscious, as schematizations\n(in a quasi-Kantian respect) of desiring subjectivity. Put\ndifferently, the wants and wishes of a particular subject are shaped\nand governed by a peculiar skeletal template, an idiosyncratic and\nparadigmatic Ur-scene, in which this desiring subject is\npositioned in a specific manner vis-\u00e0-vis a specific\nobject of its desire. This fundamental template/scene is an\nunconscious formation operating as a transcendental condition of\npossibility for the subject\u2019s libidinal economy in all its\ncrucial, symptomatic manifestations. Lacan\u2019s matheme for the\nfantasy is $ \u25ca a. The $ stands for the subject of desire\nbrought into being by the barring/splitting consequences of\nOthers\u2019 mediating influences (see\n 2.3\n and\n 2.4.1\n above).\n\nThe a stands for objet petit a, that is, object\na as the \u201cobject-cause of desire.\u201d Lacan employs\nthis latter phrase for object a because this\n\u201cobject\u201d is a spectral, virtual construct of what would\nqualify as \u201cIT\u201d for the desiring subject (see\n 2.4.1\n above), with this libidinal-transcendental schema of desire\u2019s\nobject (i.e., a) \u201ccausing\u201d select given empirical\nobjects in a person\u2019s libidinal-amorous history and experience\nto be desired as stand-ins for \u201cIT.\u201d However, these\nsubstitutes are always and necessarily inadequate and unsatisfactory\ndue to an insurmountable, ineliminable gap between the\nmore-than-empirical fantasmatic objet a originating in the\nsubject\u2019s unconscious past and the empirical objects present and\nfuture incarnating it. These latter objects are situated in\nImaginary-Symbolic reality, condemned partially and imperfectly to\nembody an interminably receding and elusive surplus (i.e., the\nimpossible-qua-Real dimension of object a).\n\nTo refer back one last time to the matheme of fantasy ($ \u25ca\na), the diamond-shaped \u201clozenge\u201d\n(poin\u00e7on) \u25ca can be read as a condensation of four\nsymbols: one, \u2227 (the logical symbol for conjunction\n[\u201cand\u201d]); two, \u2228 (the logical symbol for disjunction\n[\u201cor\u201d]); three, > (the mathematical symbol for\n\u201cgreater than\u201d); and, four, < (the mathematical symbol\nfor \u201cless than\u201d). As per Lacan\u2019s matheme, the\nsubject\u2019s desires are scripted and orchestrated by an\nunconscious fundamental fantasy in which the desiring subject ($) is\npositioned in relation to its corresponding object-cause of desire\n(a). Hence, \u2227, \u2228, >, and < represent, in a\ndeliberately loose and open fashion, possible variants of this\npositioning of $ vis-\u00e0-vis a. Singular subjects flesh\nout conjunction, disjunction, being \u201cgreater than,\u201d and\nbeing \u201cless than\u201d in their own styles, namely, as their\nunique fantasies of merger or symbiosis (conjunction), scorn or\nrefusal (disjunction), mastery or domination (\u201cgreater\nthan\u201d), slavery or submission (\u201cless than\u201d), and any\nnumber of other possible particularizations of these four basic\ncategories of rapport.\n\nIn some of Lacan\u2019s earlier presentations of the mirror stage,\nthe a serves as an abbreviation for autre (other).\nMore precisely, in this context, a refers primarily to the\nlittle-o-other as the Imaginary ego (see\n 2.2\n and\n 2.3\n above). The ego is an \u201cother,\u201d a not-me misrecognized as\n\u201cme,\u201d insofar as it is brought into existence through a\ncombination of an object external to the (proto-)subject (i.e., the\nimago-Gestalt of the body image) and the interests of\nSymbolic and Real Others investing this object through words and\nbehaviors. Within the framework of the mirror stage, a\n(usually as a\u2019) also designates alter-egos as the\nImaginary partners with which the ego itself is inextricably\nintertwined, invariably defining itself through reference to these\npartners.\n\nFurthermore, there indeed is a thread of continuity between the\na of the mirror stage and object a: Both ego (as\na) and fantasy (with its a) unconsciously are the\nsubject\u2019s fateful answers to the questions, \u201cWhat does the\nOther want?\u201d and \u201cHow must I position myself with respect\nto the desire of the Other?\u201d (see\n 2.3\n above). Lacan\u2019s a, like the rest of his mathemes, is\ndeliberately handled as akin to an algebraic variable. It is a\nplaceholder for any number of particular types of determinants: what\nan Other desires, what I must be so as to be the object of an\nOther\u2019s desire, what would at last lay to rest my restless\nstrivings and yearnings, what would do so for a significant Other to\nwhom I remain attached, etc. But, in all cases, a reflects\nLacan\u2019s Hegelian-Koj\u00e8vian slogan having it that,\n\u201cman\u2019s desire is the desire of the Other.\u201d\n",
