    "main_text": "Speculative Physics || Maxima and Minima\n3.2 Maxima and Minima\n\nIn chapter V of the Regulae, Heytesbury considers the limits\nof capacities, and he applies the limit-concept to the bounding of the\nranges of variables and aggregates. All capacities are sorted as\nactive or passive. An active capacity (force) is measured against the\npassive capacity (resistance) which it can overcome. If an active\ncapacity can overcome some resistance, it can overcome less. For\nexample, if Socrates can lift one hundred pounds, he can lift fifty\npounds. Conversely, if a passive capacity can be affected by less, it\ncan be affected by greater. For example, if Socrates can see a grain\nof millet from the distance of a mile, he will be able to see the\nChurch at the same distance. The boundaries of capacities are of two\nkinds: an intrinsic boundary (when an element is a member of the\nsequence of elements it bounds: maximum quod sic, minimum quod\nsic) and an extrinsic boundary (when an element which serves as a\nboundary stands outside the range of elements which it bounds:\nmaximum quod non, minimum quod non). From the definitions of\nactive and passive capacities, it follows that the boundary of an\nactive capacity must be assigned either by the affirmation of the\nmaximum (maximum quod sic) or by the negation of the minimum\n(minimum quod non); the boundary of a passive capacity is\nassigned either by the affirmation of the minimum (minimum quod\nsic) or by the negation of the maximum (maximum quod\nnon).\n\nHeytesbury sets the following conditions which must be obtained for\nlimits to exist: (1) there must be a range in which the capacity can\nact or be acted upon, and another range in which it cannot act or be\nacted upon, and not both; (2) each capacity should only be able to\ntake a value in the range on which it is measured from zero and the\nvalue which serves as its boundary. Thus, if an active capacity is\ncapable of acting upon a given passive capacity in the range, it must\nbe capable of acting upon any less, and if it is not capable of acting\nupon a given passive capacity, it is not capable of acting upon any\ngreater. Conversely, if a passive capacity is capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it must be capable of being acted upon by any\nagent of greater strength, and if it is not capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it is not capable of being acted upon by a\nweaker agent; and (3) infinite capacities like the infinite power of\nGod are excluded from the discussion, since no termination can be\nassigned for them ([RSS] 1494: fol. 29va\u2013vb).\n\nHeytesbury, like Kilvington, classifies all capacities as mutable or\nimmutable. A mutable capacity is capable of more and less, and both\naffirmative and negative parts of the division might be assigned. For\nexample, with respect to Socrates, a mutable power of lifting (an\nactive capacity) a minimum quod non is assigned. For a\npassive capacity the maximum quod non is assigned, e.g., a\nmaximum visible body which cannot be seen at a given distance. An\nimmutable capacity acts in a determinate way, so it produces only the\none effect it actually produces. Therefore, the affirmative part of\nthe division is always assigned as a boundary for immutable capacity.\nThus, e.g., there is a maximum distance which, ceteris\nparibus, Socrates can traverse in an hour by a speed which\nincreases uniformly from A to B degree ([RSS] 1494: fol. 29vb; Wilson\n1960: 73).\n",
