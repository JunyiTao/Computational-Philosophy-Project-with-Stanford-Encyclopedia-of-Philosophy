    "main_text": "\n\nMary Shepherd (1777\u20131847) advocates a systematic metaphysics and\ntheory of knowledge which were highly regarded by her contemporaries.\nWell versed in the doctrines of leading eighteenth century British\nempiricists, she finds them unable to sustain scientific inquiry,\neveryday practical reasoning, and belief in an almighty deity. She\naims to replace them with a theory of perceptual knowledge that is\nreliable and supported by reasons. She urges a theory on which\nsensation, the reception of impressions by means of the senses, and\nunderstanding, the ability to deploy ideas that represent entities\ndistinct from impressions, work together to yield perceptual\nknowledge. In this respect, her system is more like that of Kant than\nthose of her other predecessors. But her doctrines express a highly\ndistinctive analysis of perception and the reality of its objects.\n\nCausality is the center of her metaphysical and epistemic systems.\nShepherd contends that the relation between cause and effect is one of\nefficacy, necessity, and simultaneity. She is an essentialist whose\nontology recognizes basic capacities, powers, and compound objects in\nnatural kinds. It anticipates recent essentialist theories on which\nproperties of objects in natural kinds are individuated as powers or\ndispositions (Fantl 2016; Wilson forthcoming) The first of her two\nbooks, Essay upon the Relation of Cause and Effect (Shepherd\n1824 abbreviated \u201cERCE\u201d), is chiefly concerned with\nderiving and developing this doctrine while pointing to errors in the\nreasoning of Hume and his followers. Her second volume, Essay on\nthe Perception of an External Universe (Shepherd 1827,\nabbreviated \u201cEPEU\u201d) includes a main text that uses causal\nreasoning to explain our knowledge of a universe of objects external\nto ourselves. It has a second part containing several short essays on\nrelated topics including Berkeley\u2019s idealism, final causes in\nnature, and why sensible qualities cannot be causes.\n",
