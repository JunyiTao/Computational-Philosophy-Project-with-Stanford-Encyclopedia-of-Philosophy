If I believe a set of propositions and at the same time\ndisbelieve an obvious logical consequence thereof my set of beliefs\npresumably exhibits a rational defect. Rational requirements are\ncharacterized by their demand for coherence: they demand either a\nparticular kind of coherence among our attitudes or else coherence\nbetween our attitudes and the evidence. Niko Kolodny has dubbed the\nformer \u201crequirements of formal coherence as such\u201d (Kolodny\n2007: 229). They are formal in the sense that they concern\nlogical relationships between attitude contents or the arithmetical\nrelationships between the degrees of confidence we invest in those\ncontents. The qualification \u201cas such\u201d indicates that an\ninternal coherence among the attitudes is demanded to the exclusion of\nother epistemologically relevant factors (evidential considerations,\nfor example). Requirements of this type, it has been argued (Broome\n2000; Dancy 1977), take the form of wide scope principles. Hence, they\ndo not generally prescribe a particular attitude, but are satisfiable\nin a number of ways. Or, to put it another way, they prohibit\nparticular constellations of attitudes. For instance, Wo\u2212\nproscribes states like the one just imagined, in which the agent\nbelieves all of the premises of a valid argument while disbelieving its conclusion. It may\nbe satisfied, as we have seen, by either coming to believe the\nconclusion or by abandoning some of the premises.\n\nThe status of logical norms as a species of rational requirement\nraises weighty questions. For one, Kolodny (2005) has challenged the\nseemingly natural assumption that rationality is normative at all.\nThat is, he has questioned whether we in fact have reason to\ndo what rational requirements require of us. It might be that\nrationality makes certain demands on us, but that it is an open\nquestion as to whether we should want to be rational. Here is not the\nplace to develop these ideas, let alone to try to resolve the\n\u201cnormative question\u201d for rationality (see Way 2010 for an\noverview). In the absence of a convincing response to Kolodny\u2019s\nchallenge, some might take umbrage at our talk of logical\nnorms. Strictly speaking, we should speak of them as\nnecessary conditions for rationality, leaving open whether we have\nreason to be rational.\n\nWhile it would take us too far afield to address the question of the\nnormativity of rationality, there is a related strand of Kolodny\u2019s\nargument that is more directly relevant to our discussion. The claim\nin question, put forth in Kolodny 2007 & 2008, is that there\nsimply is no reason for postulating the existence of formal coherence\nrequirements as such at all. This may seem surprising. After all, to\ntake Kolodny\u2019s simplest example, we certainly do have the\nintuition that an agent who, at a given time, believes both \\(p\\) and\n\\(\\neg p\\) is violating a requirement\u2014a requirement, presumably,\nof something like the following form:\n\n(NC)  \\(S\\)\nis required not to both believe \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) at \\(t\\) (for any\ntime \\(t\\)). \n\n\nIf Kolodny is right that there are no pure formal coherence\nrequirements like\n (NC),\n how are we to explain our intuitions? Kolodny\u2019s strategy is to\ndevise an error theory, thereby seeking to show how coherence (or near enough\ncoherence) in the relevant sense emerges as a by-product of our\ncompliance with other norms, norms that are not themselves pure formal\ncoherence requirements, thus obviating the need for postulating pure\nformal coherence requirements.\n\nConsider how this plays out in the case of\n (NC).\n Kolodny proposes an evidentialist response. Any violation of\n (NC)\n is indeed a violation of a norm, but the relevant norm being violated\nis a (narrow scope) evidential norm: the norm, roughly, that one has\nreason to believe a proposition only in so far as \u201cthe evidence\nindicates, or makes likely, that\u201d the proposition is true. A\nnorm, in other words, much like\n (EN)\n (in the supplement on Bridge Principles). The thought is that any\n instance of my violating\n (NC)\n is eo ipso an instance in which my beliefs are out of whack\nwith the evidence. For when I hold contradictory beliefs, at least one\nof the beliefs must be unsupported by the evidence. As Kolodny puts\nit,\n\n\nThe attitudes that reason requires, in any given situation, are\nformally coherent. Thus, if one has formally incoherent attitudes, it\nfollows that one must be violating some requirement of reason. The\nproblem is not, as the idea of requirements of formal coherence as\nsuch suggests, that incoherent attitudes are at odds with each other.\nIt is instead that when attitudes are incoherent, it follows that one\nof these attitudes is at odds with the reason for it\u2014as it would\nbe even if it were not part of an incoherent set. (Kolodny 2007: 231)\n\n\nAnother way of making Kolodny\u2019s point is to note the following.\nSuppose I find myself believing both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg p\\), but that\nthe evidence supports \\(p\\) (over its negation). If\n (NC)\n were the operative norm, I could satisfy it \u201cagainst\nreason\u201d, i.e., by coming to believe \\(\\neg p\\). But adherence to\n (NC)\ncontra the evidence seems like an unjustified\n\u201cfetish\u201d for \u201cpsychic tidiness\u201d. (Kolodny\nproposes similar maneuvers for other types of putative formal\ncoherence norms, and for norms of logical coherence in\nparticular.)\n\nWhat Kolodny assumes here is that there are, in Broome\u2019s words,\n\u201cno optional pairs of beliefs\u201d (Broome 2013: 85). That is,\nit is never the case that belief in \\(A\\) and belief in \\(\\neg A\\) is\nequally permissible in light of the evidence. As Broome points out,\nKolodny\u2019s assumption is founded on a commitment to\nevidentialism, which may cause some to get off the bus. Notice,\nthough, that even if we accept Kolodny\u2019s argument along with its\nevidentialist presuppositions, there may still be room for logical\nnorms. Such norms would not constrain beliefs directly, since only\nevidence constrains our beliefs on Kolodny\u2019s view. Yet, the\nevidence itself would be structured by logic. For instance, if \\(A\\)\nentails \\(B\\), then since \\(A\\) cannot be true without \\(B\\) being\ntrue, any evidence that counts in favor of \\(A\\) should also count in\nfavor of \\(B\\). Logic would then still exert normative force. However,\nits normative force would get only an indirect grip on the\nagent\u2019s doxastic attitudes by constraining the evidence. It is not clear how robust the distinction is, especially against the background of conceptions that take evidence to be constituted largely (or entirely) by one's beliefs. Moreover, Alex Worsnip 2015 has argued that in cases of misleading higher-order evidence, failures of coherence cannot ultimately be explained in terms of failures to respond adequately to the evidence.\n",
