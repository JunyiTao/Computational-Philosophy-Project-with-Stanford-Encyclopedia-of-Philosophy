    "main_text": "The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality\n8. The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality\n\n\nIn sections 5-7, we considered the nature of quantum non-locality as\ndepicted by theories that violate factorizability, i.e., the assumption\nthat the probability of joint measurement outcomes factorizes into the\nsingle probabilities of these outcomes. Recalling section 3,\nfactorizability can be analyzed into a conjunction of two conditions:\nOI (outcome independence)\u2014the probability of a distant\nmeasurement outcome in the EPR/B experiment is independent of the\nnearby measurement outcome; and PI (parameter independence)\u2014the\nprobability of a distant measurement outcome in the EPR/B experiment\nis independent of the setting of the nearby measurement\napparatus. Bohm's theory violates PI, whereas other mainstream quantum\ntheories satisfy this condition but violate OI. The question arises as\nto whether violations of PI involve a different kind of non-locality\nthan violations of OI.  So far, our methodology was to study the\nnature of quantum non-locality by analyzing the way various quantum\ntheories account for the curious correlations in the EPR/B\nexperiment. In this section, we shall focus on the question of whether\nquantum non-locality can be studied in a more general way, namely by\nanalyzing the types of non-locality involved in violations of PI and\nin violations of OI, independently of how these violations are\nrealized.\n",
