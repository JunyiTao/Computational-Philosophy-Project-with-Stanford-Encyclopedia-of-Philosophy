    "main_text": "Religion and Postsecularism || Jerusalem and Athens: Religious Faith and Philosophical Reason\n7.2 Postsecular Deliberative Democracy\n\nIn writings since the turn of the millennium, Habermas adapts his\ndiscourse theory of law and democracy so as to take account of the\npostsecular nature of modern societies. He uses this expression\n\n\nto describe modern societies which must assume that religious groups\nwill continue to exist and that different religious traditions will\nremain relevant, even if the societies themselves are largely\nsecularized. (2012 chapter 4 [2017: 63])\n\n\nHis postsecular political theory, then, applies mostly to European and\nother Western countries with an established tradition of secular\ndemocracy, which must take account of the presence of religious\nminorities (2009 chapter 5: 59). One alleged problem with earlier\nmodels of deliberative democracy, such as those outlined by Rawls in\nPolitical Liberalism or by Habermas himself in Between\nFacts and Norms, is that they place unfair cognitive burdens on\nreligious citizens of secular states, and in doing so threaten to\nundermine these states\u2019 legitimacy. The central issue is the\nexclusion of religious language from the public sphere, and it can be\naddressed by modifying the discourse theory of law and democracy so as\nto let religious citizens participate fully. Habermas identifies two\nproblems with secular deliberative democracy. It forces religious\ncitizens to \u201csplit their identities\u201d between public\n(secular) and private (religious) personae (2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\n126\u20137, 130]), and places asymmetrical burdens upon them,\ncompared with their secular fellow citizens. Consider Rawls\u2019s\n\u201cduty of civility\u201d which required citizens not to make use\nof their comprehensive doctrines while deliberating in public, and to\nrestrict themselves to political conceptions of justice, which are\nwithin the bounds of public reason (Rawls 1995 [1996: 217]). Or\nconsider Rawls\u2019s later, more moderate view, namely the proviso\nwhich allows that citizens can adduce \u201ccomprehensive\nreasons\u201d in public political discussion, provided that \u201cin\ndue course\u201d these are replaced by proper political reasons\n(Rawls 1993 [2005: 462, l]). Following Paul Weithman and Nicholas\nWolterstorff (Weithman 2002; Audi & Wolterstorff 1997), Habermas\nobjects to Rawls\u2019s proviso for placing morally unacceptable\nburdens on citizens of faith, since\n\n\nmany religious citizens would not be able to undertake such an\nartificial division within their own minds without jeopardizing the\npious conduct of their lives. (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 127])\n\n\nHe also claims that burden is unfairly distributed, weighing only on\nbelievers (2001b chapter 2 [2003b: 109]; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\n136]). Some critics have countered that identity-splitting can also\naffect non-believers (Boettcher 2009; Holst & Molander 2015),\nwhile others rejoin that it is a reasonable demand to make of modern\ndemocratic citizens in pluralist societies, which does not threaten\ntheir complex identities (Mautner 2014: 24; Finlayson 2019: 11).\nHabermas, however, argues that both objections apply to Rawls\u2019s\nidea of public reason, governed by the proviso.\n\nNow, Habermas\u2019s account of legitimate law-making in Between\nFacts and Norms is wedded to the principle of the separation of\nchurch and state, and has an unabashedly secular conception of\npolitics. The principle of democracy implies that laws are legitimate\nwhen citizens\u2019 contributions to the informal public\nsphere filter through into the formal public sphere (the\nstate apparatus, parliaments, and legal systems), and influence\nlaw-making (1992b [1996b: 371\u20132, 441\u20132]). When this cycle\nof feedback is operating correctly, citizens can understand themselves\nas the \u201cauthors and addressees\u201d of the law (1992b [1996b:\n120]), since they have indirectly participated in the legislative\nprocess.\n\nHowever, religious citizens cannot contribute authentically to a\nsecular public sphere. Their contributions to public discourse, if\nphrased in secular language, will have little meaning for them, and\nthus they will find themselves in the heteronomous position of only\nbeing the addressees of the law, not its authors (2005b chapter 5\n[2008a: 128, 130]). Habermas fears that the secular nature of the\npublic sphere prevents religious citizens from fully taking part in\nthe discursive processes which legitimate laws. They might comply\nstrategically, seeing the law as a mere fact, and not a norm, but for\nthem the laws passed by secular democratic states would lack\nlegitimacy. There is evidently a danger here of large numbers of\nreligious believers becoming alienated from democratic law-making,\nwith the concomitant danger of political instability and a\nlegitimation crisis (2009 chapter 5: 76).\n\nThe problem is how to construe and design the modern political system\nin a way that is more congenial to religious citizens, without\nabandoning the secular political state, and how to show that the\nWeithman/Wolterstorff objections, which Habermas agrees apply\nRawls\u2019s proviso, do not apply to his own theory. His proposed\nsolution, a model of postsecular deliberative democracy, has\ntwo elements corresponding respectively to the formal and informal\npublic spheres; namely to the political system and civil society.\n\nFirst, echoing Rawls, Habermas proposes an \u201cinstitutional\ntranslation proviso\u201d at the threshold between the informal and\nformal public spheres. In the formal public sphere, public officials,\npoliticians, and judges must restrict themselves to secular language,\nbut in the informal public sphere, ordinary citizens are free to\ncontribute to public discourse in religious language (2009 chapter 5:\n76; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a 130\u20132]). Before these religious\nstatements pass through into the formal public sphere and impact the\nlegislative process, they are to be translated into secular terms, a\ncooperative task in which both religious and non-religious citizens\ntake part (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 112\u20133]; 2012 chapter 7 [2017:\n172]). The institutional translation proviso thus acts as a filter,\nmaintaining the secular nature of the state, but allowing religious\ncitizens free reign to air their religious reasons in informal public\ndiscourse (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 131]).\n\nSecond, religious and non-religious citizens in civil society must\nundergo complementary learning processes, leading to them becoming\nreflexive about their beliefs (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 111\u20132]).\nFor religious believers, this involves coming to terms with three\naspects of modern society: reasonable pluralism, the priority of\nscientific knowledge, and the secular nature of the state (2001b\nchapter 2 [2003b: 104]; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 137]; 2012 chapter 7\n[2017: 173]). For non-believers, it involves accepting the continuing\npresence of religion in modern society, coming to view their\ndisagreements with believers as reasonable, accepting that believers\nhave a right to contribute to the public sphere in religious language,\nbeing willing to help translate those contributions into secular\nlanguage, and finally forgoing scientism, and scientistically\nmotivated atheism, in favour of political agnosticism (2005b chapter 4\n[2008a: 113]; 2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 263\u20134]; 2005b chapter 10\n[2008a: 309\u201310]; see also Baxter 2011: 205).\n\nTaken together, Habermas claims, these learning processes help to\nequalize the cognitive burdens borne by religious and non-religious\ncitizens. This model of postsecular deliberative democracy, Habermas\nargues, solves the problems of identity-splitting and de-legitimation\nwhich secularism inflicts on religious believers. Since they can now\ncontribute to the informal public sphere in religious language,\nbelievers no longer have to split their identities in two; since they\nknow that their religiously based contributions are making an impact\non the formal public sphere, they can see the laws which it produces\nas legitimate.\n\n\nEven if the religious language is the only one which they speak in\npublic, and if religiously justified opinions are the only ones they\ncan or wish to contribute to political controversies, they\nnevertheless understand themselves as members of a civitas\nterrena, which empowers them to be the authors of laws to which\nthey are subject as addressees. (2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\n130\u20131])\n\n\nHabermas\u2019s theory has come in for criticism from all sides. On\nthe one hand critics like Amy Allen claim that there is a residual\nasymmetry, and that Habermas still \u201cstacks the decks in favour\nof secularism\u201d (Allen 2013: 149). Wolterstorff agrees, though he\nthinks the problem lies with the idea of \u201cpost-metaphysical\nreason\u201d, while Allen traces it to his \u201cgenealogy of\npost-secular reason\u201d. Cristina Lafont argues, by contrast, that\nthe asymmetric burden falls the other way, since the cognitive\nlearning process imposes a duty on secular citizens to give up their\nscientistically motivated atheism in favour of politically motivated\nagnosticism (Lafont 2013: 238; Finlayson 2019: 14). The idea of\n\u201csacred-to-secular translation\u201d is central to\nHabermas\u2019s model of postsecular deliberative democracy. As an\nexample, Habermas cites German Christian groups translating the\nstatement from Genesis that \u201cGod created man in his own\nimage\u201d into secular language as \u201ca gamete fertilized\nex utero has the status of a subject of human rights\u201d\nas part of their arguments against stem-cell research (2001b chapter 2\n[2003b: 109]). Yet the idea has proved controversial. It is not clear,\nfor example, whether or not Habermas considers it to work the same way\nas ethical and philosophical appropriations of religious concepts (see\nCooke 2011; Kerkwijk 2015; Rees 2018: 143\u201365). For Wolterstorff\nit relies on the idea of post-metaphysical reason that is skewed in\nfavour of secularism, while Rees argues that the idea is empty, since\nno such translations are possible. \n",
