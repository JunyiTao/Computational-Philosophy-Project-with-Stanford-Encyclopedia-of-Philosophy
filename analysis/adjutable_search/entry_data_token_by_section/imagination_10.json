    "main_text": "Roles of Imagination\n3. Roles of Imagination\n\nMuch of the contemporary discussion of imagination has centered around\nparticular roles that imagination is purported to play in various\ndomains of human understanding and activity. Amongst the most\nwidely-discussed are the role of imagination in understanding other\nminds\n (section 3.1),\n in performing and recognizing pretense\n (section 3.2),\n in characterizing psychopathology\n (section 3.3),\n in engaging with the arts\n (section 3.4),\n in thinking creatively\n (section 3.5),\n in acquiring knowledge about possibilities\n (section 3.6),\n and in interpreting figurative language\n (section 3.7).\n\nThe variety of roles ascribed to imagination, in turn, provides a\nguide for discussions on the nature of imagination\n (section 1)\n and its place in cognitive architecture\n (section 2).\n",
