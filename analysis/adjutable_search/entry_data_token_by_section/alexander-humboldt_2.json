In that\nsame year, he moved to Paris, with the aim of securing travel to one\nof the French colonies. After a number of failed attempts in\nFrance\u2014largely on account of political events\u2014Humboldt,\nalongside his scientific companion, the French botanist Aim\u00e9\nBonpland (1773\u20131858), travelled to Spain. There they were\ngranted permission from the Spanish Crown to visit South America. On 5\nJune 1799, they set sail on the Pizarro, stopping in Tenerife\non the way, and arriving some six weeks later in Cumana, in\npresent-day Venezuela.\n\nHumboldt took with him a significant number of expensive\ninstruments\u2014many of which were difficult to transport\u2014for\nmeasuring altitude, latitude, air pressure, the blueness of the sky,\natmospheric composition, and magnetism. As Humboldt explains in a\nletter to the Spanish King from 22 March 1799, his desire to travel to\nSouth America has to do with his interest in \u201canalyzing the\natmosphere\u201d, and \u201crecognizing the general relationships\nthat bind organized beings\u201d (quoted in Puig-Samper 1999).\n\nOver the next five years, Humboldt and Bonpland explored the northern\nand western parts of South America, canoed down the Orinoco River,\ntrekked in the Andes, visited scientific luminaries in Quito, Bogota,\nand Havana, and travelled through Mexico and Cuba. During their time\nin Cuba (from December 1800 to March 1801), Humboldt observed the\nsituation of the slave laborers in the plantations. From there they\nsailed to Columbia, and then to Ecuador. On 23 June 1802, with the\nhelp of an Indigenous guide, the two companions, alongside their new\nfriend, Carlos Montuf\u00e1r (1780\u20131816), climbed Chimborazo,\nwhich at the time was considered to be the highest peak. Though they\ndid not reach its summit, they achieved a record that was not\nsurpassed until 1838.\n\nIn 1804, Humboldt and Bonpland travelled to the United States of\nAmerica, where Humboldt met with Thomas Jefferson in the spring of\nthat year. A key topic of discussion was the American economic\ndependence on slavery, which Humboldt challenged on moral grounds.\n",
