    "main_text": "Do Speech Acts Have a Logic?\n9. Speech Acts and Social Issues\n\nIn a paradigmatic illocutionary event, a speaker has a choice of which\nif any speech act to perform and her addressee will do her charitable\nbest to discern that speaker\u2019s intentions and, where necessary, which\nconventions she may be invoking. Pratt (1986) observes that this\nparadigm is not true to the facts of many areas of communicative\nlife, writing\n\nAn account of linguistic interaction based on the idea of exchange\nglosses over the very basic facts that, to put it crudely, some people\nget to do more talking than others, some are supposed to do more\nlistening, and not everybody\u2019s words are worth the same. (1986, p. 68)\n\n Although Pratt intends this remark as a critique of speech act\ntheory, it also suggests a way in which this theory might shed light\non subtle forms of oppression. We saw in Section 2.2 that a putative\nbet can misfire if it is not accepted. In such a case the speaker\nattempts to bet but fails in that effort due to a lack of audience\nuptake. So too, a person may not be in the correct social position to, say, excommunicate or appoint, and her attempts to perform such illocutions will misfire. More momentously, a pattern of abuses\nof speech act institutions might deprive a person of an ability to\nperform speech acts: the inveterate promise-breaker will, in time, lead others\nin his community to be unwilling to accept any promises he tries to\nmake. He can perform countless locutionary acts but will be unable to\nperform the illocutionary act of promising, at least in this\ncommunity.\n\nA pattern of culpable behavior could make a speaker unable to perform one speech act type. Could a pattern of culpable\nbehavior\u2013intentional or inadvertent\u2014on the part of others\nin a speaker\u2019s community achieve the same effect? This could happen if enough such speakers decide never\nto accept one person\u2019s bets, warnings, or promises. Beyond such\nhypothetical cases, it has been argued that patterns of social\ninequality can prevent members of certain groups from performing the speech acts they would choose to. Building on and refining\nMcKinnon\u2019s (1993) claim that pornography silences women, Langton\n(1993), and Hornsby and Langton (1998) argue that the industry and\nconsumption of pornography deprive women of the ability to perform the\nspeech act of refusing sexual advances. Refusing is a speech act, but\nif large enough numbers of men deny uptake (with such thoughts as,\n\u201cBy \u2018no\u2019 she really means \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d\netc.) then, these authors argue, women\u2019s attempts to refuse sexual\nadvances will be characteristically inert with respect to the speech\nact of refusal. Women will still be able to attempt to refuse sexual\nadvances, and can still try to prevent them by physical means, but a\ncrucial illocutionary form of protection will be closed to them. So\ntoo, apartheid, Jim Crow, and even patterns of discrimination of which\nthe perpetrators are not consciously aware, can deprive racial,\nreligious, and ethnic minority groups of the ability to perform\nspeech-act types requiring uptake. These phenomena are generally\nreferred to as illocutionary silencing.\n\nBird (2002) denies that the speech act of refusal requires\nuptake. Such an illocution is, he contends, like inviting and\nsurrendering, which can occur whether or not their intended audiences\ngrasp or accept the proffered illocutions. Similarly denying that the\n\u201csilencing\u201d argument should be cast in terms of speech\nacts, Maitra 2009 argues that the institution of pornography prevents\nspeaker-meant instances of refusal from being understood. One can\nspeaker-mean that she refuses, for instance, but patterns of cognitive\nand affective response will systematically prevent that refusal from\nbeing grasped. Broadening the scope of investigations of the\ninteraction of injustice and illocutionary phenomena, McGowan 2009\nargues that some speech acts can not only cause but also constitute\ninstances of oppression. Anderson, Haslanger and Langton (2012) provide overviews of research on racial, gender\nand related forms of oppression as they relate to speech acts. \n\n\nAlthough not inherently culpable, the practice of dogwhistling has\nalso recently gained the interest of theorists of speech acts. As\nsuggested by the metaphor, an agent dogwhistles just in case one or\nmore dimensions of a speech act she performs is readily intelligible\nonly to a proper subset of her addressees. Saul 2018 notes that in\ncontemporary American politics, stating one\u2019s opposition to the\nSupreme Court case of Dred Scott seems to be a way of signaling one\u2019s\nanti-abortion sympathies. For those not in the know, however, a\nspeaker\u2019s opposition to the Dred Scott appears to be an\nuncontroversial act of rejecting racism. The phenomenon of\ndogwhistling provides an apparent challenge to conceptions of speaker\nmeaning in terms of overtness, since the dogwhistler would seem to\nspeaker mean a content that is cryptic to all but her insider\naudience: is her utterance both overt and covert? Instead of adopting\nsuch a view, one who construes speech acts in terms of overtness could\nrefine the notion of manifestness occuring in her account. What is\nmanifest to one addressee may not be manifest to another, and a\nspeaker may exploit this fact. Accordingly, someone who avows, \u201cI\u2019m\nagainst Dred Scott,\u201d may speaker-mean that she is both against Dred\nScott and pro-life to one part of her audience, but only that she is\nagainst Dred Scott to another part.\n",
