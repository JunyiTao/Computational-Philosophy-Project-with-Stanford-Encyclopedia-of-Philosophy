    "main_text": "Neopythagoreanism\n4. Neopythagoreanism\n\nNeopythagoreanism is characterized by the tendency to see Pythagoras\nas the central and original figure in the development of Greek\nphilosophy, to whom, according to some authors (e.g. Iamblichus,\nVP 1), a divine revelation had been given. This revelation\nwas often seen as having close affinities to the wisdom of earlier\nnon-Greeks such as the Hebrews, the Magi and the Egyptians. Because of\nthe belief in the centrality of the philosophy of Pythagoras, later\nphilosophy was regarded as simply an elaboration of the revelation\nexpounded by Pythagoras; it thus became the fashion to father the\nviews of later philosophers, particularly Plato, back onto Pythagoras.\nNeopythagoreans typically emphasize the role of number in the cosmos\nand treat the One and Indefinite Dyad as ultimate principles going\nback to Pythagoras, although these principles in fact originate with\nPlato. The origins of Neopythagoreanism are probably to be found\nalready in Plato\u2019s school, the Academy, in the second half of\nthe fourth century BCE. There is evidence that Plato\u2019s\nsuccessors, Speusippus and Xenocrates, both presented Academic\nspeculations arising in part from Plato\u2019s later metaphysics as\nthe work of Pythagoras, who lived some 150 years earlier. After a\ndecline in interest in Pythagoreanism for a couple of centuries,\nNeopythagoreanism emerged again and developed further starting in the\nfirst century BCE and extending throughout the rest of antiquity and\ninto the middle ages and Renaissance. During this entire period, it is\nthe Neopythagorean construct of Pythagoras that dominates, a construct\nthat has only limited contact with early Pythagoreanism; there is\nlittle interest in an historically accurate presentation of Pythagoras\nand his philosophy. In reading the following account of\nNeopythagoreanism, it may be helpful to refer to the\n Chronological Chart of Sources for Pythagoras,\n in the entry on Pythagoras.\n",
