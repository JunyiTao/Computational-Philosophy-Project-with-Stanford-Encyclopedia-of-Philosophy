    "main_text": "Alethic pluralism about truth: a plurality of properties || Alethic pluralism, inflationism, and deflationism\n1.3 Alethic pluralism, inflationism, and deflationism\n\n\nThe foregoing varieties of pluralism are consistent with various\nfurther analyses of pluralists\u2019 ideas about truth. For instance,\npluralists may\u2014but need not\u2014hold that truth properties are\nsimply one-place properties, since commitments to truth\u2019s being\nmonadic are orthogonal to commitments to its being monistic. However,\nmost pluralists converge on the idea that truth is a substantive\nproperty and take this idea as the point of departure for articulating\ntheir view.\n\n\nA property is substantive just in case there is more to its nature\nthan what is given in our concept of the property. A paradigmatic\nexample of a substantive property is the property of being water. There\nis more to the nature of water\u2014being composed of H\\(_2\\)O,\ne.g.\u2014than what is revealed in our concept of water (the\ncolourless, odourless liquid that comes out of taps, fills lakes,\netc.)\n\n\nThe issue of substantiveness connects with one of the major issues\nin the truth debate: the rift between deflationary theories of truth\nand their inflationary counterparts (Horwich 1990; Edwards 2013b;\nK\u00fcnne 2003; Sher 2016b; Wyatt 2016; Wyatt & Lynch 2016). A common way to understand the divide between\ndeflationists and inflationists is in terms of the question whether or\nnot truth is a substantive property. Inflationists endorse this idea,\nwhile deflationists reject it. More specifically, deflationists and\ninflationists can be seen as disagreeing over the following claim:\n\n(6) there exists some property \\(F\\) (coherence,\ncorrespondence, etc.) such that any sentence, if true, is so in virtue\nof being \\(F\\)\u2014and this is a fact that is not transparent in\nthe concept of truth.\n\n\n\nThe inflationist accepts (6). According to her, it is not\ntransparent in the concept of truth that being true is a matter of\npossessing some further property (cohering, corresponding, etc.). This\nmakes truth a substantive property. The deflationist, on the other\nhand, rejects (6) because she is committed to the idea that everything\nthere is to know about truth is transparent in the concept\u2014which,\non the deflationist\u2019s view, is exhausted by the disquotational\nschema (\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if, and only if, \\(p)\\), or some principle\nlike it.\n\n\nDeflationists also tend to reject a further claim about\ntruth\u2019s explanatory role:\n\n(7) \\(F\\) is necessary and sufficient for explaining the truth\nof any true sentence \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nInflationists, on the other hand, typically accept both (6) and\n(7).\n\n\nStrong and moderate versions of pluralism are perhaps best\nunderstood as versions of a non-traditional inflationary theory (for an exception, see Beall 2013; for refinements, see Edwards 2012b and Ferrari & Moruzzi forthcoming).\nPluralists side with inflationists on (6) and (7), and so, their views\ncount as inflationary. Yet, traditional inflationary theories are also\npredominantly monistic. They differ about which property\n\\(F\\)\u2014coherence, identity, superwarrant, correspondence,\netc.\u2014truth consists in, but concur that there is precisely one\nsuch property:\n\n(8) there is a single property \\(F\\) and truth\nconsists in a single property \\(F\\).\n\n\n\nThe monistic supposition in (8) is tantamount to the claim that\nthere is but one way of being true. In opposing that claim, pluralism\ncounts as non-traditional.\n",
