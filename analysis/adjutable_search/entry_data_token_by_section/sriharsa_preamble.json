    "main_text": "\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a was an Indian philosopher and poet, who lived\nin northern India in the 12th century\n CE.[1]\n \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a didn\u2019t affiliate himself explicitly to\nany philosophical text tradition active in classical India. Some have\nargued that he was an advocate of Advaita Ved\u0101nta (Phillips 1995;\nRam-Prasad 2002). Ved\u0101nta (literally, the end of the Vedas) is a\nfamily of competing philosophical interpretations of the texts called\nUpani\u1e63ads that appear at the end of the\n Vedas.[2]\n Many texts of Ved\u0101nta are commentaries on the canonical summary\nof the Upani\u1e63ads given by B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u0146a\u2019s\nAphorisms on the Brahman (Brahmas\u016btra). Advaita\nVed\u0101nta (i.e., non-dualistic Ved\u0101nta) is an interpretation\nof the Upani\u1e63ads and B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u0146a\u2019s\nAphorisms, according to which it is only the self or\nconsciousness or Brahman that is ultimately real. The Indian\nphilosopher \u015aa\u1e43kara (7th century CE) defended\nthis form of non-dualism in his commentary on\nB\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s Aphorisms.\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s only surviving philosophical\n work[3]\nThe Sweets of Refutation\n(Kha\u1e47\u1e0danakha\u1e47\u1e0danakh\u0101dya) may be\nread as a defense of this kind of non-dualism, even though he\ndoesn\u2019t share all the standard commitments of \u015aa\u1e43kara\nand his followers. This reading of \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, however,\nremains controversial (Granoff\n 1978).[4]\n\nThe broader appeal of \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s work is\nindependent of whether he was a defender of Advaita Ved\u0101nta.\nThroughout The Sweets of Refutation,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s aim is to demonstrate the instability\nof rational inquiry within philosophy. For any argument that a\nphilosopher may offer for her view, there is always an equally\npersuasive counterargument that undermines its conclusion. Since the\ndeliverances of reason are always vulnerable to rational defeat in\nthis way, they cannot constitute good evidence for any philosophical\nview. To illustrate this idea, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a targets a\nphilosophical method\u2014what we may call the method of\ndefinition\u2014pursued by Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosophers in informal logic, epistemology and\n metaphysics.[5]\n The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers use this method of\ndefinition to describe a number of ontological categories which are\nsupposed to capture the structure of reality, and a number of\nepistemological and logical categories which are supposed to capture\nvarious components of rational inquiry. What the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher wishes to affirm in the\nend is a dualistic ontology: the commonsense view on which\nreality consists of a plurality of things distinct from the self or\nconsciousness, e.g., material things, their qualities, relations\namongst them, and so on. \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a wants to show that\nany attempt at defining the epistemological, logical, and\nontological categories that the dualist needs for the success of her\nproject must fail: the very standards of rational inquiry that the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers adopt undermine their\ntheoretical enterprise from within.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s incisive arguments against\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika informal logic, epistemology and\nmetaphysics were influential amongst the defenders of both Advaita\nVed\u0101nta and Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\n philosophy.[6]\n However, they should also be of considerable interest to the\ncontemporary reader. In the second half of the twentieth century,\nAnglophone philosophers have grappled with various difficulties that\narise for definitions of epistemological notions like\nknowledge and metaphysical notions like causation.\nWhile attacking the method of definition pursued by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\nanticipates many of these difficulties. His reaction to these\ndifficulties is pessimistic: he takes these difficulties to\ndemonstrate the futility of offering definitions for commonsense\nepistemological and ontological categories.\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s arguments for this conclusion remain\nas relevant to our current philosophical concerns as they were to\nthose of his contemporaries: if his arguments are successful, they\nwill show that philosophical inquiry doesn\u2019t really take us very\nfar when it comes to illuminating fundamental epistemological and\nmetaphysical concepts.\n\nSince it is impossible to address all the philosophically interesting\nthemes that emerge from \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s work, most of\nour discussion in this article shall focus on a small number of topics\nthat illustrate \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s general approach to\nphilosophical problems.\n",
