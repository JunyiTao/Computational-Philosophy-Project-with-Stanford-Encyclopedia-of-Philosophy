    "main_text": "Meinong on Philosophy\n2. Meinong on Philosophy\n\nMeinong was neither a speculative philosopher nor a so-called\nphilosophical system thinker. Nevertheless he gradually developed a\nphilosophical system which included the main disciplines and had his\ntheory of objects at its center. Meinong\u2019s terminology\nconstantly increased, and the number of his ideas and alleged objects\ngrew steadily \u2014 although with significant revisions of some of\nhis older views.\n\nMeinong\u2019s metaphilosophical reflections do not yield something\nlike a definition of what philosophy is, and in his autobiography he\nconcedes that he has not yet found a conceptually exact formula for\nit. Philosophy is supposed to be not a single sharply delineated\nscience but an assemblage of sciences which are held together by the\nfact that they have to do with mental phenomena (1921a: 101; 1885: 5).\nThere are no specifically philosophical objects, but everything that\ncan be experienced \u201cmay be handled philosophically if treated\nfrom the point of view of its relation to the human thinking\nsubject\u201d (Hicks 1922: 5). Because of this, psychology becomes a\nfundamental discipline of this philosophical congeries. Another even\nmore basic philosophical discipline is the theory of objects as it is\nthe most general, comprehensive and fundamental science. According to\nMeinong, its range is wider than metaphysics because metaphysics deals\nonly with existing things, i.e. with the entirety of the real. As\nmetaphysics is determined by \u201cthe prejudice in favor of the\nactual\u201d, it can only be seen as a universal science a\nposteriori. However, the theory of objects goes beyond that. It\nis an a priori science as it has to do with whatever can be\nknown a priori about objects. It deals essentially with\nobjects as such, or in Meinongian words, it \u201chas to do with the\ngiven taken in its entirety\u201d (1904b, \u00a7\u00a72, 11).\n\nMeinong saw himself neither in the camp of the empiricists nor in the\ncamp of the rationalists; instead he claimed to be an empirical\nalthough not a psychologistic thinker (1907, \u00a7\u00a725\u20136).\nAlthough Meinong\u2019s theory of objects is an a priori\nscience, its method can be characterized as a philosophy from\nbelow, a working method that follows the precepts of a kind of\nbottom-up thinking. There is an important analogy between the\nempirical (a posteriori) sciences and the theory of objects\nas a paradigmatic a priori science: both start from given\ndata. In the case of the empirical sciences these data are\nexperiences, while the data of the theory of objects usually are\nthings that are not existent but only subsistent [bestehend]\nor even merely outside of being [au\u00dferseiend] (1917,\n\u00a711: 103 [92]; 1921a, Sect. 2.F: 130). This\n\u201cempirical manner of investigating\u201d was appreciated by\nRussell (1904: 205), for instance. Moreover, our general as well as\nour particular knowledge of language facts is able to supply us with\nadditional data as basis of further theorizing. Meinong (1904b,\n\u00a710: 33 [103]) thus says \u201cthat the general theory\nof objects has to learn from grammar just as the specialized theory of\nobjects can and must learn from mathematics\u201d (cf. also 1904b: 15\n[88]; 1907: 109). He also told his students that it is best\nto begin one\u2019s investigations with linguistic data (Nachlass,\nKarton IV/b), and \u2014 because of this \u2014 that the answer to\nthe question what the common man thinks of this or that situation or\nof this or that word is an indispensable presupposition of all other\ninquiry (Nachlass, Karton XI/e; cf. Manotta 2005: 65\u201368).\n\nMeinong considers ethics, aesthetics and logic to be the primary\ndisciplines of practical philosophy. It is worth noting that he\ncontrasts his customary use of \u201clogic\u201d as a practical\ndiscipline, which was adopted from Brentano and is comparable to\nPort-Royal Logic [La Logique ou l\u2019art de\npenser (Logic, or the Art of Thinking)], with\nKant\u2019s and, especially, Husserl\u2019s conception of a\n\u201cformal\u201d or \u201cpure\u201d logic and also with\nsymbolic logic, \u201cLogistik\u201d, and algebra of logic, which\nall can be seen as parts of his theory of objects. He puts the\ndistinction between theoretical and practical disciplines primarily\ndown to the difference between theoretical and practical interests and\nnot to the difference between the subject matters of the sciences. In\ncontrast to the disciplines of theoretical philosophy \u2014\nmetaphysics, object theory, and theory of knowledge, for example\n\u2014, which are determined by cognitive aims, the practical\ndisciplines set themselves practical goals. They can be seen as\nsomething like applied sciences or branches of engineering\n[Kunstlehren], quite comparable to architecture, and nautical\nor military sciences.
