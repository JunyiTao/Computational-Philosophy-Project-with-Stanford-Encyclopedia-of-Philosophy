    "main_text": "Interpretation of the Great Learning\n4. Interpretation of the Great Learning\nIn the standard Confucian curriculum of Wang\u2019s era, the Great\nLearning was the first of the Four Books that students were\nassigned, and Zhu Xi\u2019s commentary on it often made a lasting\nimpression on them. In the opening of the Great Learning,\nConfucius describes the steps in self\u2013cultivation:\n\nThe ancients who desired to enlighten the enlightened Virtue of the\nworld would first put their states in order.  Those who desired to put\ntheir states in order would first regulate their families.  Those who\ndesired to regulate their families would first cultivate their\nselves. Those who desired to cultivate their selves would first\ncorrect their minds.  Those who desired to correct their minds would\nfirst make their thoughts have Sincerity.  Those who desired to make\ntheir thoughts have Sincerity would first extend their knowledge.\nExtending knowledge lies in g\u00e9 w\u00f9. (Translation\nslightly modified from Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 188\u2013189)\n\nGe wu is left unexplained in the Great Learning.\nHowever, Zhu Xi, following the interpretation of Cheng Yi, claims\nthat\n\n\u2026what is meant by \u201cextending knowledge lies in ge\nwu\u201d is that desiring to extend my knowledge lies in\nencountering things and exhaustively investigating their Pattern.  In\ngeneral, the human mind is sentient and never fails to have knowledge,\nwhile the things of the world never fail to have the Pattern.  It is\nonly because the Pattern is not yet exhaustively investigated that\nknowledge is not fully fathomed.  Consequently, at the beginning of\neducation in the Great Learning, the learner must be made to encounter\nthe things of the world, and never fail to follow the Pattern that one\nalready knows and further exhaust it, seeking to arrive at the\nfarthest points.  When one has exerted effort for a long time, one\nday, like something suddenly cracking open, one will know in a manner\nthat binds it all together. (Translation slightly modified from Tiwald\nand Van Norden 2014, 191)\n\nFollowing Zhu Xi\u2019s interpretations, most translators today render\nge wu as \u201cinvestigating things.\u201d Wang and his\nfriend Qian were trying to \u201cinvestigate things\u201d in this\nmanner when they stared attentively at the bamboos, struggling to\ngrasp their underlying Pattern.  It is questionable, though, whether\nthis is what Zhu Xi had in mind.  Zhu certainly thought the Pattern\nwas present in everything, and could potentially be investigated in\neven the most mundane of objects.  However, he emphasized that the\nbest method to learn about the Pattern was through studying the\nclassics texts of Confucianism, particularly the Four Books.  \nAs important as learning was for Zhu Xi, he stressed that it was\npossible to know what is right and wrong yet not act on it:\n\u201cKnowledge and action always need each other.  It\u2019s like how\neyes cannot walk without feet, but feet cannot see without eyes.  If\nwe discuss them in terms of their sequence, knowledge comes first.\nBut if we discuss them in terms of importance, action is what is\nimportant\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 180\u201381).  What\nconnects knowledge and action, on Zhu Xi\u2019s account, is Sincerity.\nSincerity (ch\u00e9ng) is a subtle and multifaceted notion\nin Neo\u2013Confucian thought.  However, the Great Learning\nfocuses on one key aspect of it: \u201cWhat is meant by \u2018making\nthoughts have Sincerity\u2019 is to let there be no self\u2013deception.\nIt is like hating a hateful odor, or loving a lovely sight.  The is\ncalled not being conflicted\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 191).\nIn other words, humans engage in wrongdoing through a sort of\nself\u2013deception in which they allow themselves to ignore the\npromptings of their moral sense, and become motivated solely by their\nphysical desires for sex, food, wealth, etc.  Once one knows what is\nright and wrong, one must then make an effort to keep that knowledge\npresent to one\u2019s consciousness, so that it becomes motivationally\nefficacious.  As Zhu Xi explains, \u201c\u2026those who desire to\ncultivate themselves, when they know to do good in order to avoid the\nbad, must then genuinely make an effort and forbid\nself\u2013deception, making their hatred of the [ethically] hateful\nbe like their hating a hateful odor, and their loving what is good\nlike their loving a lovely sight\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n192).  \nWang challenged almost every aspect of Zhu Xi\u2019s interpretation of\nthe Great Learning. He regarded Zhu Xi\u2019s account as not just\ntheoretically mistaken but dangerously misleading for those seeking to\nimprove themselves ethically.  However, Wang recognized that students\nwho had memorized Zhu Xi\u2019s interpretation to prepare for the civil\nservice examinations would have difficulty understanding the text any\nother way.  Consequently, when he accepted a new disciple, Wang often\nbegan by explaining his alternative interpretation of the Great\nLearning, and invited students to ask questions.  Wang\u2019s approach\nis preserved in a brief but densely argued work, \u201cQuestions on\nthe Great Learning.\u201d Let\u2019s begin at the apparent\nfoundation of the Great Learning\u2019s program: ge wu.\nWhereas Zhu Xi argues that ge wu is literally \u201creaching\nthings,\u201d meaning to intellectually grasp the Pattern in things\nand situations, Wang argues that ge wu means\n\u201crectifying things,\u201d including both one\u2019s own thoughts and\nthe objects of those thoughts.  For Zhu Xi, ge wu is\nprimarily about gaining knowledge, while for Wang it is about\nmotivation and \naction.[8] \nThe fact that the Great Learning explicates ge wu\nin terms of \u201cextending knowledge\u201d might seem to support\nZhu Xi\u2019s interpretation.  However, Wang offers a plausible alternative\nexplanation: \u201cTo fully extend one\u2019s knowledge is not like the\nso\u2013called \u2018filling out\u2019 of what one knows that later\nscholars [like Zhu Xi] talk about. It is simply to extend fully the\n\u2018pure knowing\u2019 of my own mind.  Pure knowing is what\n[Mencius] was talking about when he said that all humans have\n\u2018the mind of approval and disapproval.\u2019 The mind of\napproval and disapproval \u2018knows without pondering\u2019 and is\n\u2018capable without learning\u2019\u2009\u201d (Tiwald and Van\nNorden 2014, 248, glosses \nmine).[9]\n Wang is suggesting that \u201cextending\nknowledge\u201d refers simply to exercising our innate faculty of\nmoral awareness, which Mencius refers to as \u201cpure\nknowing.\u201d As David S. Nivison explains, \u201cWe might say that\nWang\u2019s \u2018extending\u2019 of knowledge is more like extending\none\u2019s arm than, say, extending one\u2019s vocabulary\u201d (Nivison 1996a,\n225).\nAccording to Zhu Xi, the opening of the Great Learning\nlists a series of steps that are, at least to some extent, temporally\ndistinct. Wang demurs:\n\nWhile one can say that there is an ordering of first and last in this\nsequence of spiritual training, the training itself is a unified whole\nthat cannot be divided into any ordering of first and last.  While\nthis sequence of spiritual training cannot be divided into any\nordering of first and last, only when every aspect of its practice is\nhighly refined can one be sure that it will not be deficient in the\nslightest degree. (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 250)\n\n\nWang\u2019s argument here is similar to the one he made about the verbal\ndistinction between knowing and acting (Section 3, above). He claimed\nthat the ancient sages recognized that knowing and acting were\nultimately one thing, but sometimes discussed them separately for\npedagogic purposes, to help those who underemphasized one aspect of\nthis unity.  Similarly, Wang suggests, the Great Learning\nuses multiple terms to describe various aspects of the unified\nexercise of moral agency, but does not mean to suggest that these are\nactually distinct temporal stages:\n\n\u2026we can say that \u201cself,\u201d \u201cmind,\u201d\n\u201cthoughts,\u201d \u201cknowledge,\u201d and\n\u201cthings\u201d describe the sequence of spiritual training.\nWhile each has its own place, in reality they are but a single thing.\nWe can say that \u201cge wu,\u201d \u201cextending,\u201d\n\u201cmaking Sincere,\u201d \u201ccorrecting,\u201d and\n\u201ccultivating\u201d describe the spiritual training used in the\ncourse of this sequence.  While each has its own name, in reality they\nare but a single affair.  What do we mean by \u201cself\u201d?  It\nis the way we refer to the physical operations of the mind.  What do\nwe mean by \u201cmind\u201d? It is the way we refer to the luminous\nand intelligent master of the person. (Translation slightly modified\nfrom Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 247)\n\nWang even interprets the key metaphor of the Great\nLearning in a very different way from Zhu Xi.  For Zhu Xi, hating\nevil \u201clike hating a hateful odor,\u201d and loving good\n\u201clike loving a lovely sight\u201d are goals that we must aspire\nto, but can only achieve after an arduous process of ethical\ncultivation.  For Wang Yangming, these phrases describe what our\nattitudes toward good and evil can and should be at the very inception\nof ethical cultivation:\n\n\u2026the Great Learning gives us examples of true knowing\nand acting, saying it is \u201clike loving a lovely sight\u201d or\n\u201chating a hateful odor.\u201d Seeing a lovely sight is a case\nof knowing, while loving a lovely sight is a case of acting.  As soon\nas one sees that lovely sight, one naturally loves it.  It is not as\nif you first see it and only then, intentionally, you decide to love\nit.  Smelling a hateful odor is a case of knowing, while hating a\nhateful odor is a case of acting.  As soon as one smells that hateful\nodor, one naturally hates it.  It is not as if you first smell it and\nonly then, intentionally, you decide to hate it.  Consider the case of\na person with a stuffed\u2013up nose.  Even if he sees a malodorous\nobject right in front of him, the smell does not reach him, and so he\ndoes not hate it.  This is simply not to know the hateful\nodor. (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 267)\n\nIn summary, Zhu Xi and Wang agree that the Great Learning\nis an authoritative statement on ethical cultivation, expressing the\nwisdom of the ancient sages.  However, for Zhu Xi, it is analogous to\na recipe, with distinct steps that must be performed in order.  For\nWang, the Great Learning is analogous to a description of a\npainting, in which shading, coloring, composition, perspective and\nother factors are aspects of a unified effect.  \n",
