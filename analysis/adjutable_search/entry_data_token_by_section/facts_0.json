    "main_text": "Philosophies of Facts || Facts, Facts & Facts\n1.1 Facts, Facts & Facts\n\nThe word \u201cfact\u201d is used in at least two different ways. In\nthe locution \u201cmatters of fact\u201d, facts are taken to be what\nis contingently the case, or that of which we may have empirical or\na posteriori knowledge. Thus Hume famously writes at the\nbeginning of Section IV of An Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding: \u201cAll the objects of human reason or inquiry\nmay naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas\nand Matters of Fact\u201d. The word is also used in locutions such\nas\n\nIt is a fact that Sam is sad\nThat Sam is sad is a fact\nThat \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) is a fact.\n\n\nIn this second use, the functor (operator, connective) \u201cIt is a\nfact that\u201d takes a sentence to make a sentence (an alternative\nview has it that \u201cIt is a fact\u201d takes a nominalised\nsentence, a that-clause, to make a sentence), and the predicate\n\u201cis a fact\u201d is either elliptic for the functor, or takes a\nnominalised sentence to make a sentence. It is locutions of this\nsecond sort that philosophers have often employed in order to claim\n(or deny) that facts are part of the inventory of what there is, and\nplay an important role in semantics, ontology, metaphysics,\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind.\n\nWe may, then, distinguish between Humean facts and functorial facts.\nWith the help of this distinction, two philosophical options can be\nformulated. One may think that there are facts in the functorial sense\nof the word which are contingent\u2014the fact that Sam is\nsad\u2014and facts in the functorial sense which are not\ncontingent\u2014the fact that \\(2 + 2 = 4\\). Or one may think that\nall facts in the functorial sense are contingent, are Humean matters\nof fact. The latter option is expounded in the influential philosophy\nof facts to be found in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\n(1921). Wittgenstein there announces that the world is the totality of\nfacts and that every fact is contingent (Wittgenstein TLP:\n1.1).\n\nThe word \u201cfact\u201d, particularly when it is understood in the\nfunctorial sense, belongs to a family of related terms:\n\u201ccircumstance\u201d, \u201csituation\n(Sachlage)\u201d, \u201cstate of affairs\n(Sachverhalt)\u201d. We refer happily to the state of\naffairs or circumstance that Sam is sad and to the situation in which\nSam is sad, although \u201cIt is a circumstance/situation that Sam is\nsad\u201d, unlike \u201cIt is a fact/the case that Sam is\nsad\u201d, is ill-formed.\n\nIn what follows, we distinguish three types of account of what it is\nto be a fact in the functorial sense and consider some possible roles\nfor facts which have been thought to yield arguments in favor of\nadmitting facts into our inventory of what there is. Since the\ncategory of facts is a formal category, a semantic or ontological\ncategory, we then look in some detail at different formal theories of\nfacts and their ilk.\n\nWhat might a fact be? Three popular views about the nature of facts\ncan be distinguished:\n\nA fact is just a true truth-bearer,\nA fact is just an obtaining state of affairs,\nA fact is just a sui generis type of entity in which\nobjects exemplify properties or stand in relations.\n\n\nIn order to understand these claims and the relations between them it\nis necessary to appeal to some accounts of truth, truth-bearers,\nstates of affairs, obtaining, objects, properties, relations and\nexemplification. Propositions are a popular candidate for the role of\nwhat is true or false. One view of propositions has it that these are\ncomposed exclusively of concepts, individual concepts (for example,\nthe concept associated with the proper name \u201cSam\u201d),\ngeneral concepts (the concept expressed by the predicates \u201cis\nsad\u201d and \u201cest triste\u201d) and formal concepts\n(for example, the concept expressed by \u201cor\u201d). Concepts so\nunderstood are things we can understand. Properties and relations, we\nmay then say, are not concepts, for they are not the sort of thing we\nunderstand. Properties are exemplified by objects and objects fall\nunder concepts. Similarly, objects stand in relations but fall under\nrelational concepts.\n\nIt will be convenient to understand the view that a fact is just a\nsui generis type of entity in which objects exemplify\nproperties or stand in relations as relying on the way of\nunderstanding properties and relations just sketched. We shall refer\nto the view as the claim that facts are exemplifications. Similarly,\nwe may understand the claim that a fact is an obtaining state of\naffairs to say that a state of affairs is something which contains one\nor more objects and at least one property or relation and that a state\nof affairs obtains if an object exemplifies a property or one or more\nobjects stand in a relation. \u201cObtains\u201d (German:\n\u201cbesteht\u201d) belongs to the same family of\npredicates as \u201cis true\u201d. Just as it is often argued that\nthe truth-predicate is tenseless and timeless, so it is sometimes\nargued or assumed that \u201cobtains\u201d is tenseless and\ntimeless. A distinct question: Is \u201cobtain\u201d not simply a\nfancy way of saying \u201cexists\u201d? (Sundholm 1994). No, it is\nsometimes claimed. Obtaining is a mode of being. If a state of affairs\nobtains, then an obtaining state of affairs exists, a fact exists. In\nthis respect, \u201cobtains\u201d resembles \u201cendures\u201d.\nThings endure. If a thing endures, then the enduring thing exists.\n\nBut it should be noted that some philosophers use\n\u201cproposition\u201d or \u201cstructured proposition\u201d\n(Soames 2010) to refer to what are here called \u201cstates of\naffairs\u201d and that some philosophers do not distinguish between\nproperties and concepts. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that\nin ordinary English the expression \u201cstate of affairs\u201d is\nnot normally used to refer to something which obtains or fails to\nobtain. It is used to refer to what is the case. Philosophers who talk\nof \u201cstates of affairs\u201d as obtaining or failing to obtain\nare employing the term as a technical term, often as a translation of\nthe German word \u201cSachverhalt\u201d. Finally, states of\naffairs, unlike facts, are commonly said to last or endure, whereas\n\u201cSachverhalte\u201d do not last or endure.\n\nThe two views of facts as exemplifications of properties and as\nobtaining states of affairs raise many metaphysical and ontological\nquestions and are often appealed to in giving answers to metaphysical\nand ontological questions. They are also often appealed to in answers\nto questions about semantics and intentionality. Finally, facts are\nsometimes invoked in an area where semantics and ontology connect, the\ntheory of truthmaking. Throughout the twentieth century the categories\nof fact and state of affairs have also been been the object of\nscepticism (see Betti 2015).\n",
