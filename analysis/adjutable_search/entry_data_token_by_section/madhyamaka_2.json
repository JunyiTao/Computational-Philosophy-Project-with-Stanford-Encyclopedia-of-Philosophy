    "main_text": "Buddhap\u0101lita\n3. Buddhap\u0101lita\n\nAside from a commentary entitled Akutobhaya (Afraid of\nnothing), which is traditionally ascribed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna but\nthe authorship of which is questioned by modern scholars, the earliest\nextant commentary to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s MMK is the\nMadhyamakav\u1e5btti by Buddhap\u0101lita (ca 470\u2013ca\n540). The original Sanskit of this text is not known to exist, but it\nis still extant in Tibetan translation. Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s\ncommentary, like Akutobhaya stays close to the text upon\nwhich it is a commentary. The MMK is written in verse, and\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s commentary places the words of the verse\ntext into standard prose word order and offers glosses to disambiguate\npotentially confusing words. Like the MMK itself,\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s commentary does not offer a positive\nposition but rather shows the untenability of all the apparently\npossible solutions to the philosophical questions taken up for\nexamination. The principal method of examining a position in MMK and\nin Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s commentary is to show that unwelcome\nconsequences are entailed by the position under consideration.\n\nAn example of the approach used by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nBuddhap\u0101lita is their discussion of the relation between a cause\nand its effect, the topic taken up in MMK 1.1. There are only four\npossible relationships: the cause is the same as the effect, the cause\nis different from the effect, the cause is both the same as and\ndifferent from the effect, or the cause is neither the same as nor\ndifferent from the effect. This fourth position would be tantamount to\nsaying that there is no cause, and that an effect therefore arises out\nof nothing at all. Each of these four possibilities is rejected in\nturn, each for a different reason. Buddhap\u0101lita argues that if an\neffect were identical to its cause, then it would already exist as the\ncause and would have no need of coming into being a second time.\nIdentity of cause and effect defeats the very idea of causality. If\nthe effect were different from the cause, on the other hand, then\nthere would be no constraints on what could arise out of what, so long\nas the cause and the effect were different. The third possibility is\nuntenable, says Buddhap\u0101lita, since it is merely the conjunction\nof the two hypotheses that have just been shown to be untenable. A\nproposition consisting of the conjunction of two false propositions\ncannot be true. The fourth possibility, like the first, undermines the\nvery idea of causality. Moreover, says Buddhap\u0101lita, it would\nrender all practice ineffectual; what he probably had in mind here was\nspecifically Buddhist religious practice, which is predicated on\nidentifying the root causes of dissatisfaction and then eliminating\nthose root causes so that dissatisfaction disappears.\n\nBeyond showing the untenability of each of the relations that were\ndiscussed as possible relations between the relata in a particular\nsituation, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Buddhap\u0101lita have little to\nsay. Opponents to the Madhyamaka school were critical of this\napproach, saying in effect that there is little value in finding fault\nwith a philosophical view unless one is prepared to offer a better\nview to replace the faulty one. As will become more clear in what\nfollows, it was precisely this issue\u2014that is, whether there is a\nvalue in simply finding faults in philosophical views\u2014that\nbecame controversial among M\u0101dhyamikas.\n",
