    "main_text": "\n\nOver the course of his life, Gottlob Frege formulated two logical\nsystems in his attempts to define basic concepts of mathematics and to\nderive mathematical laws from the laws of logic. In his book of 1879,\nBegriffsschrift: eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete\nFormelsprache des reinen Denkens, he developed a second-order\npredicate calculus and used it both to define interesting mathematical\nconcepts and to state and prove mathematically interesting\npropositions. However, in his two-volume work of 1893/1903,\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, Frege added (as an axiom) what\nhe thought was a logical proposition (Basic Law V) and tried to derive\nthe fundamental axioms and theorems of number theory from the\nresulting system. Unfortunately, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a\nlogical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be\ninconsistent, for it was subject to Russell\u2019s Paradox.\n\nUntil late in the 20th century, the inconsistency in Frege\u2019s\nGrundgesetze overshadowed a deep theoretical accomplishment\nthat can be extracted from his work. The Grundgesetze\ncontains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order\nlogic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single\nconsistent principle. This consistent principle, known in the\nliterature as \u201cHume\u2019s Principle\u201d, asserts that for\nany concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), the number of \\(F\\)-things is equal to\nthe number \\(G\\)-things if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the \\(F\\)-things and the \\(G\\)-things. Though\nFrege derived Hume\u2019s Principle from Basic Law V in the\nGrundgesetze, the subsequent derivations of the fundamental\npropositions of arithmetic from Hume\u2019s Principle do not\nessentially require Basic Law V. So by setting aside the problematic\nBasic Law V and the derivation of Hume\u2019s Principle, one can\nfocus on Frege\u2019s derivations of the basic propositions of\narithmetic using Hume\u2019s Principle as an axiom. His theoretical\naccomplishment then becomes clear: his work shows us how to prove, as\ntheorems, the Dedekind (1888)/Peano (1889a) axioms for number theory from\nHume\u2019s Principle in second-order logic. This achievement, which\ninvolves some remarkably subtle chains of definitions and logical\nreasoning, has become known as Frege\u2019s Theorem.\n\nThe principal goal of this entry is to present Frege\u2019s Theorem\nin the most logically perspicuous manner, without using\nFrege\u2019s own notation. Of course, Frege\u2019s own notation is\nfascinating and interesting in its own right, and one must come to\ngrips with that notation when studying Frege\u2019s original work.\n(See the entry on \n  Frege\u2019s logic for a\n  precise and systematic study of the notation in Frege's formal system.)\nBut one need not understand Frege\u2019s notation to understand\nFrege\u2019s Theorem, and so we will, for the most part, put aside\nFrege\u2019s own notation and the many interpretative issues that\narise in connection with it. We strive to present Frege\u2019s\nTheorem by representing the ideas and claims involved in the proof in\nclear and well-established modern logical notation. With a clear\nunderstanding of what Frege accomplished, one will be better prepared\nto understand Frege\u2019s own notation and derivations, as one reads\nFrege\u2019s original work (whether in German or in\ntranslation). Moreover, our efforts below should prepare the reader to\nunderstand a number of scholarly books and articles in the secondary\nliterature on Frege\u2019s work, e.g., Wright 1983, Boolos 1990, and\nHeck 1993, 2011, and 2012.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we presuppose only a familiarity with the\nfirst-order predicate calculus. We show how to extend this language\nand logic to the second-order predicate calculus, and show how to\nrepresent the ideas and claims involved in Frege\u2019s Theorem in\nthis calculus. These ideas and claims all appear in Frege 1893/1903,\nwhich we refer to as Gg I/II. But we\nsometimes also cite his book of 1879 and his book of 1884 (Die\nGrundlagen der Arithmetik), referring to these works as\nBegr and Gl, respectively.\n",
