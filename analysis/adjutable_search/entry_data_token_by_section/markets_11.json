However, they are often\nintertwined in intricate\n ways.[11]\n One example concerns assumptions about human rationality: standard\neconomic models assume perfect rationality, which excludes problems\nsuch as weakness of the will, so that normative criticisms of markets\nthat build on the ability of more rational market participants to\nexploit the weaknesses of less rational market participants cannot be\nraised within this framework. More generally, plausible arguments\nchallenge the possibility of value-free economic theorizing (see e.g.,\nMongin 2006). This means that philosophers who want to discuss\nnormative issues about markets need to take care to make explicit the\nnormative assumptions that might enter their view of these markets\nbecause they are built into the economists\u2019 models. While the\nmainstream of economic theorizing in the last decades has used a\nrational choice methodology, new approaches, for example, behavioral\neconomics or institutional economics, have worked with different\nassumptions, raising new methodological challenges. For example,\nexplorations of the importance of norms of fairness in economic\ncontexts (e.g., Kahneman/Knetsch/Thaler 1986; Fehr/Schmidt 1999) raise\nquestions about the relation between the fairness norms favored by\npolitical philosophers and the norms observable in people\u2019s\nbehavior. Another interesting area are \u201cnudges\u201d that are\nsupposed to lead people to more rational or more socially desirable\nbehavior by changing institutional defaults (e.g., Thaler/Sunstein\n2008), which leads to philosophical questions about paternalism.\n",
