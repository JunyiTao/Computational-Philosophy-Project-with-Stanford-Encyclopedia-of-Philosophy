    "main_text": "Daoist Ethics\n4. Daoist Ethics\n4.1 Ethical perspectives drawn from the Daodejing: the \u201dsoft\u201c style of action and social primitivism\n\nIn the Daodejing (the text is associated with Laozi and is\nthought to have originated sometime in the period of\n6th-3rd century B.C.E.) and Zhuangzi (a\ntext associated with the historical Zhuangzi who lived in the\n4th century B.C.E.) the focus shifts from the human social\nworld to the cosmos, in which that human world often appears to be\ntiny and insignificant or even comically and absurdly self-important.\nIt may seem that such a distanced and detached perspective has no\nethical content or implications, but that is to assume an overly\nnarrow vision of the ethical. In its own way, Daoism addresses as much\nas Confucianism does questions as to how one ought to live one\u2019s\nlife. Daoist ethics emphasizes appropriate responsiveness to the\nbroader world that shapes and enfolds the human social world.\n\nThe nature of the vision of the broader world is open to dispute. A\ntraditional interpretation of the Daodejing is that it\nconveys a metaphysical vision of the dao as the source of all\nthings, and that this source is specially associated in nonbeing and\nemptiness as contrasted with being, perhaps suggesting that the\ndao is an indeterminate ontological ground in which the\nmyriad individual things are incipient. Some contemporary commentators\nhold that the traditional interpretation is an imposition on the text\nof later metaphysical concerns (Hansen, 1992; LaFargue, 1992). Others\nhew closer to the traditional interpretation, citing passages such as\nthose in chapter 4, where Dao is described as being empty, as seeming\nsomething like the ancestor of the myriad of things, as appearing to\nprecede the Lord (di).\n\nHowever that issue is resolved, it is apparent that a certain\nconception of the patterns of nature is embedded in the text and\ninforms its ethical recommendations. Consider the characterizations of\nnatural processes as falling into one or another of opposites: there\nis the active, aggressive, hard, and the male, on the one hand; and\nthere is the passive, yielding, soft, and female, on the other hand\n(later these forces were much more explicitly associated with\nyang and yin). Conventional \u201dknowledge\u201c\nand \u201dwisdom\u201c dichotomizes processes into one or another of\nthese categories and values the first over the second. The\nDaodejing extols the efficacy of the second. Whereas the\nfirst is associated with strength, the second, it is often said,\npossesses a deeper, underlying strength as demonstrated by water\novercoming the hard and unyielding (chapter 78). Hence a\n\u201dsoft\u201c style of action, wu wei (literally,\n\u201dnonaction\u201c but less misleadingly translated as effortless\naction) is recommended, even as a style of ruling. For example,\nchapter 66 says that one who desires to rule must in his words humble\nhimself before the people, and that one who desires to lead the people\nmust in his person follow them. Chapter 75 says that rulers eat up too\nmuch in taxes and therefore people are hungry. Rulers are too fond of\naction and therefore the people are difficult to govern. Setting too\nmuch store on life makes people treat death lightly. The last point\nbrings out the related theme that striving after something often\nproduces the opposite of the intended result. One of the more\nprominent themes in the Daodejing is the rejection of\nmoralism: a preoccupation with and striving to become good or\nvirtuous. Chapter 19 says to exterminate ren and discard\nyi (righteousness or rectitude), and the people will recover\nfilial love.\n\nOne crucial ambiguity of the text is whether the \u201dsoft\u201c\nwu wei style of action is meant consistently to be extolled\nover the \u201dhard\u201c style (as Lau claims in his introduction\nto his translation of the Daodejing, 1963), or whether the\nreversal of valuation is merely a heuristic device meant to correct a\ncommon human tendency to err in the direction of consistently valuing\nthe hard style (LaFargue, 1992). The second alternative is consistent\nwith a theme plausibly attributed to the text: that all dichotomies\nand all valuations based on them are unreliable in the end, even\nevaluations that are reversals of the conventionally accepted ones.\nPrescriptions to follow the \u201dsoft\u201c style, taken as\nexceptionless generalizations, are no more reliable than the\nconventional wisdom to follow the \u201dhard\u201c style. On the\nother hand, many of the prescriptions in the Daodejing seem\npremised on the conception of there being genuine human needs that are\nsimple and few in number, and that desires going beyond these needs\nare the source of trouble and conflict. Prescriptions for the ruler\nseem to be aimed at bringing about a reversion to a kind of\nprimitivist state of society where no \u201dimprovements\u201c are\nsought or desired. Carried to its logical limit, this primitivism\nimplies the existence of a natural goodness with which human beings\nought to become attuned. Indeed, the first of the three treasures of\nchapter 67 is ci or compassion. The ethics of the\nDaodejing is in these respects less radical and iconoclastic\nthan some of its anti-moralistic language might suggest. If we are not\nto strive after goodness, it is there nevertheless as something that\nwe must recover.\n4.2 Ethical perspectives from Zhuangzi: skeptical questioning, attunement to the grain of things, inclusion, acceptance and freedom\n\nOn this point the Zhuangzi often sounds a much more skeptical\nnote. In the second (Qi Wu Lun \u201dEqualizing All\nThings\u201c) chapter of that text, the following questions go\nunanswered: \u201dHow do I know that to take pleasure in life is not\na delusion? How do I know that we who hate death are not exiles since\nchildhood who have forgotten the way home?\u201c (translation from\nGraham, 1989, 59; see also the translation from Ziporyn, 2009). The\nhuman pretension to know what is true and important is lampooned by\ncomparing it to the pretension of the cicada and turtle dove to know\nby their own experiences of flight the possibilities of how high\ncreatures can fly. There is no vision of a primitivist utopia here\neither. Rather, the dominant attitude towards the possibility of\nlarge-scale social change for the better is pessimism. It is a\ndangerous task for the idealist to undertake, and one that will\nprobably end badly for the idealist because rulers don\u2019t like to\nbe lectured on their failings. On this matter, the Zhuangzi\nnot only diverges from the primitivist Utopian strain in the\nDaodejing but also more forcefully from the earnest and\never-striving idealism of the Confucians. In the fourth (Ren Jian\nShi \u201dThe Human World\u201c) chapter, a pessimistic\nConfucius (who here seems to be speaking on behalf of Zhuangzi) tells\nhis idealistic student Yan Hui that he will probably get himself\nkilled trying to change the ways of a callous and violent ruler.\nFurther, some passages in this story can be read as implying that Yan\nHui\u2019s deeper motivation is to gain praise for his own virtue.\nThat Yan Hui might be characterized in this way is especially\nsignificant, because the Confucian tradition regards his motivations\nas being especially pure. The implication might be that the Confucian\nidealistic project is continually and inevitably self-undermining:\npeople can sense the self-aggrandizing motivations behind the noble\ntalk and react negatively (see Chong, 2016).\n\nAt the same time, it is significant that in this story Confucius does\nnot reject Yan Hui\u2019s idealistic project altogether, but suggests\nanother way of proceeding. If he insists on trying, Yan Hui must\nrefrain from formulating plans and goals. Such preconceptions will\nonly interfere with seeing the ruler as he is and how he must be dealt\nwith (there is a grain, then, unique to each human being to which one\nmust become attuned to deal with him or her). So Yan Hui must prepare\nnot with plans but by fasting and emptying his mind, so that he can\nlisten to the ruler not only with his ears and mind, but also with his\nqi or vital energies. Such advice might in contemporary\nterms be construed as advice to cultivate one\u2019s ability to tune into\nwhat is going on with other people through one\u2019s gut intuitions, which\non a neuroscientic level might correspond to the idea that human\nbeings make practical decisions with the aid of bodily or \u201dsomatic\nmarkers\u201c which record the positive or negative valence of outcomes\nensuing from certain types of actions (Damsio\n1994).  Elsewhere in the text, there are happier references\nto activities that involve attunement to the grain of whatever is at\nhand. These forms of activity are presented as supremely satisfying.\nThe most prominent example is that of Cook Ding in the third\n(Yangsheng Zhu \u201dThe Primacy of Nourishing Life\u201c)\nchapter, the cook who is able to wield his knife so skillfully in\ncutting up oxen that it flows without a nick through the spaces within\nthe joints. Cook Ding has gotten past the stage where he sees with his\neyes while cutting the ox; instead his qi or vital energies\nmove freely to where they must go. The kind of phenomenology to which\nthe Zhuangzi refers is one in which there is no\nself-conscious guiding of one\u2019s actions but rather a complete\nabsorption with the matter of hand. The efficacy and effortlessness of\nsuch activities might appear to suggest privileged veridical access to\nthe situation and material at hand, but a less extreme interpretation\nis available.\n\nComplete absorption in the matter at hand seems to involve the ability\nto keep one\u2019s desires from interfering with one\u2019s\nattention. The Daodejing contains epigrams about the\ndesirability of being desireless, but first chapter (Xiao Yao You\n\u201dWandering Far and Unfettered\u201c of the Zhuangzi\nincludes an entertaining story that conveys this lesson. Huizi tries\nto figure out what to do with the shells of some huge gourds he had\ngrown. He tried using them as water dippers and water containers, but\nthey are too large and heavy for those purposes. Not being able to\ndiscover a purpose for them, he smashes them to pieces. Zhuangzi\nchides his friend for having underbrush in his head and not realizing\nthat he could have lashed the gourds together to make a raft for\nfloating about on the lakes and the rivers. A recurrent theme\nthroughout the first chapter is that we are ruled by our\npreconceptions of the uses of things, which keeps us from being able\nto recognize the usefulness of the \u201duseless.\u201c When\nperforming skill activities such as Cook Ding\u2019s, preoccupation\nwith the \u201duses\u201c of these activities can interfere with our\nability to perform them well. Woodcarver Qing (chapter 19 Da\nSheng \u201dFathoming Life\u201c of the Zhuangzi) makes\nmarvelous bellstands. When he goes to make one, he fasts in order to\nstill his mind. As he fasts, the distracting thoughts of\ncongratulation and reward melt away, honors and salary, blame and\npraise, skill and clumsiness, even his awareness of having a body and\nlimbs. Only when he is able to focus does he go into the forest to\nobserve the nature of the wood, and only then does he have a complete\nvision of the bellstand.\n\nInterpretations of the Zhuangzi tend to give primacy either\nto the skeptical passages or to the passages suggesting special access\nto the grain of things. On the first option, Zhuangzi simply\nappreciates the many perspectives on the world one could have, the\nmany ways of dividing the world up by sets of distinctions, none of\nwhich can be shown in a non-question-begging manner to be superior to\nthe others (Hansen, 1992, 2003; see also Chong, 2016). On the second\noption, Zhuangzi is often taken to hold in a kind of ineffable and\nnonconceptual access to the world, an access that makes possible the\nefficacy of activities such as Cook Ding\u2019s (Ivanhoe, 1996; Roth\n1999, 2000). A third possibility is that the text demonstrates a kind\nof continuing dialectic between skepticism and the conviction that one\nhas genuine knowledge, and that the dialectic has no envisioned end.\nThe dialectic includes a stage of skeptical questioning of whatever\none\u2019s current beliefs are, but the aim is not merely to\nundermine but to reveal something about the way the world that is\noccluded by one\u2019s current beliefs. However, one is not allowed\nto rest content with the new beliefs but is led to question their\ncomprehensiveness and adequacy precisely because they are suspected of\noccluding still something else about the world (Wong, 2005).\n\nThe third possibility does not subscribe to ineffable and\nnonconceptual access to the world, nor does it expouse a dogmatic\nskepticism that declares that no knowledge is possible. It is arguably\nconsistent with some of the latest thinking about human\nperception--that it operates through selecting an extremely small\nportion of sensory input  from the world and that is is both\na bottom-up and top-down process in which that input is interpreted\naccording to what we already believe about the world and is used as a\nbasis for predicting what will be experienced in the near future. If\nthere are discrepancies in our predictions we may be led to revise our\nprior beliefs and make new predictions to be tested (Clark 2016). This\nprocess is highly fallible because of necessary selectiveness in\nthe sensory input to which we attend and because of tendencies toward\nbiased interpretation of that input in the service of our prior\ncognitive commitments. Confucius\u2019 advice to Yan Hui to \u201dfast\u201c his mind\ndoes not have to be construed as cultivating an ineffable and\nunmediated access to the world but rather as meditative practice\nthat might unseat those commitments in favor of alternative\nperspectives on the world. These alternatives might better fit\nincoming sensory input or prompt us to take in a different range\nof input.\n\nSuch an interpretation aligns with apparent advocacy in the second\nchapter of going with the \u201dpresent this\u201c instead of sticking with a\nfixed perspective on the world, constituted by a set of\ndistinctions between \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019,\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong.\u2019 Confucians are described\nas having their set of \u2018this\u2019s and \u2018that\u2019s,\n\u2019right\u2019s and \u2018wrong\u2019s, which are diametrically\nopposed to the \u2018this\u2019s and \u2018that\u2019s and\n\u2018right\u2019s and \u2018wrong\u2019s of the Mohists, such\nthat the \u2019this\u2019 of the Confucians is\nthe \u2019that\u2019 of Mohists, the \u2019right\u2019 of\nConfucians being the \u2018wrong\u2019 of Confucians. Instead of\nrigidly applying any single perspective in the face of present\nexperience that does not fit it very well, the sage is described as\nfinding a \u201dpresent this.\u201c When the Zhuangzi is\nconstrued as delivering such a message, it can be situated as taking\nto the ultimate a theme that is found in much if not all classical\nChinese philosophy, one that Goldin (2005a) calls the \u201dprimacy of the\nsituation\u201c and Valmisa calls \u201dadaptive agency\u201c (2021). This theme,\nwhile not necessarily dismissing the relevance of general rules as\nguidelines for action, tends to view the particulars of the situation\nat hand as the ultimate ground for judging the appropriateness of\naction. In the Analects and the Mencius, for\nexample, this theme is reflected in its conception\nof yi or rightness as appropriateness to the\nsituation, though clearly the Zhuangzi is much\ncloser to a kind of radically particularist view of what is\nappropriate. \n\nHowever one might try to reconcile the tension between the skeptical\nquestioning and the claims to special knowledge, the stories about\nskill activities such as Cook Ding\u2019s arguably exemplify certain\nkinds of activities that human beings across cultures and historical\nperiods have experienced to their great satisfaction. These activities\ninvolve the mastery of the many sub-activities that constitute a\ncomplex activity with goals that challenge abilities of the agent. The\nactivities of master musicians (e.g., the technique of fingering on a\nflute), artistic performers (e.g., the placement of the toes in the\npirouette of a dancer) and athletes (e.g., bringing the bat through\nthe optimal plane while swinging it to hit a baseball) correspond\nrather closely to Cook Ding\u2019s mastery of the sub-activities of\ncutting through the ox. In all these activities the agent does not\nneed to pay conscious attention to performance of the sub-activities,\nand this enables attention to be focused on matters that escape the\napprentice. Just as Cook Ding\u2019s skill in the motor execution of\nthe motions of cutting allows him to fully focus on where the joints\nand spaces are, the flutist is able to concentrate on the music as she\nis making it and not her fingering technique (see Csikszentmihalyi,\n1990 for a study of such activities).\n\nOne interesting and realistic detail in the cook\u2019s story\nchallenges the reading of the skill stories as extolling the\npossibility of nonconceptual access to the grain of things. The cook\nsays that whenever he comes to a complicated place in the ox, he sizes\nup the difficulties, tell himself to watch out and be careful, keeps\nhis eyes on what he\u2019s doing, works very slowly, and moves the\nknife with the greatest subtlety until the pieces fall away. Clearly\nthere is conceptualization going on here, and in fact it is\nimplausible to deny that the whole activity is being guided by a\nconceptualized goal! There is a difference between self-conscious\nconceptualization of experience and the application of concepts\nwithout awareness of applying them. One mustn\u2019t confuse the\nlatter with nonconceptualized experience. While there may be some way\nof squaring this part of the story with the interpretation that\nnonconceptual experience is celebrated in the Zhuangzi, the\nvirtue of the story is that it is realistic and captures aspects of\nsupremely skilled activities that are part of the experience of many\npeople. Insofar as the Zhuangzi recommends such activities as\npart of a good life, it very much presents an ethic. When taken\ntogether with Confucius\u2019 initial advice to Yan Hui to listen not only\nwith his ears and not only with his mind but also with\nhis qi \n\nIt also presents an ethic in supporting the idea of inclusiveness and\nacceptance. Here skeptical questioning of what we think we know,\nespecially what we think we know about people and who is good and has\nsomething to offer to us are questioned in the chapter featuring\nstigmatized individuals, often with feet amputated (a common criminal\npunishment of the time), who turn out to be masters drawing as many\nstudents as Confucius. The Zhuangzi also urges identification\nand acceptance of the whole and of any and all of the changes that its\ncreatures undergo. We should not be so sure that life is great and\ndeath is evil, and accept everything that comes our way, marveling at\nthe possibility that upon our death we might be made into a\nfly\u2019s foreleg the next time around. The Zhuangzi, like\nthe Daodejing, calls upon human beings to identify with the\nwhole of the cosmos and its transformations, and such identification\ninvolves acceptance, even celebration of death and loss, because in\ndying one participates in the next transformation of the cosmos and\nbecomes something else to marvel at, such as a fly\u2019s foreleg.\nSuch a call may hold deep appeal, especially for those who cannot see\nany form of monotheism as a viable object for belief and yet desire\nsome sort of spiritual connection that stretches beyond the merely\nhuman community.\n\nHowever, such a call also raises challenging questions about human\npossibility. Can human beings really accept the loss of their selves\nand their loved ones with the kind of equanimity that identification\nwith the whole requires? The Zhuangzi presents stories that\nrepresent different possibilities for conceiving of the nature of this\nequanimity. In the stories of the four masters, death is accepted\nwithout the slightest shiver. In the story of the death of\nZhuangzi\u2019s wife, a more complex emotional story is told, whereby\nZhuangzi first feels her loss but comes to accept it as yet another\ntransformation. This story suggests that one may retain one\u2019s\nattachments to particular people and yet maintain resilience in the\nface of their loss because of one\u2019s identification with the\nwhole (Wong 2006; see Becker, 1998 for an discussion of resilience in\nthe face of loss in the context of developing a contemporary\nStoicism). But how is such identification psychologically possible? In\nthe Zhuangzi, it seems based on a spirit of restless and\njoyful exploration of the richness of the cosmos. In the end, it\nembodies the emotion that is perhaps most fundamental to philosophy,\nand that is wonder.\n\nAnother implication could be drawn from the values found in the\nfoundational texts that is not found in these texts but emerges in the\ncontemporary context. The Zhuangzi\u2019s lampooning of\nhuman pretension and arrogance, together with call to identify with\nthe whole and with the nonhuman parts of nature, has appealed to those\nseeking philosophical perspectives within which to frame an\nenvironmental ethic (see Girardot, Miller, and Liu, 2001). A Daoist\nperspective offers both an alternative to an instrumentalist approach\nthat would ground an environmental ethic solely in the idea that it\ndefeats human beings\u2019 interests to foul their own environment\nand to an intrinsic value approach that would ground duties to nature\nsolely in a value that it possesses apart from its relation to human\nbeings. A Daoist approach might point to the way that the human traits\nare conditioned by and responses to the nonhuman environment, such\nthat these traits cannot be specified independently of the\nenvironment. In other words the Daoist self is not a substantial\nindependent existence but a relational one whose boundaries extend\ninto the conventionally nonhuman, and from a Daoist perspective that\nis reconstructed to be oriented toward the problem of the environment,\nwe would do well to acknowledge the ways in which whatever we value in\nourselves is connected to the nonhuman (Hourdequin and Wong, 2005;\nHassoun and Wong, 2015). Treating the environment correctly is not\npurely a matter of satisfying conventional human interests such as\nconserving resources for our future consumption, nor need it be a\nmatter of recognizing a value that the environment has in complete\nindependence of its impact on us. It can be a matter of recognizing\nthat who we are cannot be cleanly separated from the nonhuman\nenvironment. Moreover, there is much to be gained from being open to\nthe transformation of our interests if we remain open to new sources\nof satisfaction in the nonhuman environment that currently escape our\nconceptions of the \u201duseful\u201c (recall Huizi and the\ngourds).\n\nNone of this shows that the composers of the classical Daoist texts\nhad an environmental ethic. Goldin (2005b) points out that\nChina does not have a very good history of concern for degradation or\noveruse of the environment and that the Daoist texts express no\nconcern about such matters. As Goldin points out, the Chinese ancients\nsimply had nothing comparable to our environmental problems. It is\npossible to find, however, fundamental attitudes toward the human\nrelationship with nature that in our own time might seem a more\npromising basis for an environmental ethic. These attitudes embody a\ndifferent relationship with nature that is not governed by the\nimperative of ceaseless consumption and the drive to colonize nature\n(see Jonathan Chan, 2009; and Miller, 2017 for further discussion of\nhow Daoism might provide resources for dealing with the contemporary\nenvironmental crisis).\n\nWithin the ancient Chinese tradition,\nthe Zhuangzi is taken to be highly\nunusual  for its celebration of individual freedom. This\nshows in the text\u2019s frequent characterization of social and moral\nnorms as constraining and controlling the individual, as motivating\nsmall-minded condemnation of those who deviate from them. It also\nshows in the text\u2019s rejection of the ideal of social and political\nservice as dangerous to the individual. Jiang (2021) sees the text as\noffering two visions of freedom as counters to such constraint:\nfreedom within the human lifeworld of social relationships; and\nfreedom beyond the human lifeworld. The first is metaphorically\nillustrated by Cook Ding\u2019s effortless, supremely responsive,\nnavigation through the joints and spaces of the ox he is cutting up.\nOne can navigate around social constraints instead of being restricted\nby them. More literally, freedom within the human lifeworld is\nexemplified in the text by friends who enjoy and accept one another\nbut refrain from unwanted interference with each other\u2019s affairs. The\nsecond is to identify with and embrace the inevitable processes of\nchange and transformation, including death and the loss of what is\nmost treasured within the human lifeworld. There are limits to the two\nkinds of freedom Jiang finds in the text: neither, in his view\nincludes the kind of freedom that can be accomplished as a social and\npolitical value through challenging and changing the norms and\ninstitutions that unduly constrain the individual.\n\nLai (2020) distinguishes a third kind of freedom she sees in\nthe Zhuangzi: freedom in\nworking with constraints. On her account, one can\ncultivate the skills needed to match one\u2019s capabilities to act with\nthe situation at hand, which of course includes whatever might be\nregarded as social constraints. But to act by working with\nconstraints is primarily to respond to the situation, which leaves\nopen the question of whether one acts within the\nconstraints, beyond them, or in some other way, perhaps even\nundermining them. This way of construing Zhuangian freedom\nis  compatible with the above discussion of the way the text\nmight be seen as encouraging the freeing of oneself from rigid\npreconceptions of how to understand the world and to be open to other\nways of understanding one\u2019s situation and to other ways of responding\nto it. Valmisa (2021) explicitly connects what she sees as social and\npolitical implications of Zhuangian freedom with the possibility of\nexpanding one\u2019s capabilities to efficaciously deal with constraints\nand to creatively imagine new possibilities. This possibility of a\nsocial and political construal of Zhuangzian values matches Chong\u2019s\n(2016) perspective on the Zhuangzi as including a\nbasic equality among all human beings that is inclusive in spirit and\nopposed to set hierarchical rankings of human beings in terms of\nunequal worth. This matches up with the Zhuangian critique of\nConfucian hierarchies, not only for society and state, but advocating\nfor the individual an egalitarian conception of the parts of a\nperson that puts the heart-mind in conversation with the rest of the\nbody rather than in command (see the entry on\n  mind (heart-mind) in Chinese philosophy).\n5. Legalism (Fajia)\n\nThinkers grouped under what is known in China as the Fajia\n\u6cd5\u5bb6 or Fa tradition are usually known in\nthe West as \u201dLegalists.\u201c This is misleading in that while the term\nfa can mean law, it can also include standards, norms,\nmodels, and methods (see Goldin 2005c, and the entry on \n legalism in Chinese philosophy).\n The English term is also misleading if taken to refer to thinkers who\nshared in common a cohesive set of doctrines when in fact the thinkers\ngrouped under the name have a fairly diverse set of\nideas. Nevertheless, there are some themes that are reasonably\nassociated with some of the most prominent thinkers. One theme is\nperhaps best introduced as the opposite reaction to Analects\n2.3, in which Confucius says that guiding the people by edicts and\nkeeping them in line with punishments will keep them out of trouble\nbut will give them no sense of shame; guiding them by virtue and\nkeeping them in line with the rites will not only give them a sense of\nshame but enable them to reform themselves. In the most prominent\nFajia text, the Hanfeizi (Hanfei lived during the\n3rd century B.C.E. For a translation, see Watson 2003), the\npeople are characterized as far too swayed by their material interests\nto be guided by a sense of shame. People must be guided by clear\nedicts and strong punishments. Furthermore, rulers must be wary of\ntheir ambitious ministers and take care not to reveal their own likes\nand dislikes so as not to be manipulated by their scheming\nsubordinates. As to rulers themselves, it is a mistake to found\ngovernment on the presumption that they are or can become virtuous.\nWhile exceptionally good and exceptionally evil rulers have existed,\nthe vast majority of rulers have been mediocre. Governments must be\nstructured so that it can run satisfactorily, because that is what\nrulers will be like almost always.\n\nThe Confucians held that the remedy to China\u2019s turmoil and chaos\nlay in wise and morally excellent rulers\u2014that moral excellence\nwould ripple downwards from the top and create harmony and prosperity.\nThe Daodejing upholds a vision of an original harmony that\nhuman beings once had, a way that consisted in living in accord with\nthe natural grain of things, and that involves seeking only what one\ntruly needs, not in multiplying useless desires that only agitate and\nultimately make us unhappy. Many in\nthe Fa tradition reject moral and spiritual\ntransformation, of either the Confucian or Laoist kind, as the\nsolution to China\u2019s troubles. Most human beings will remain\nunlovely beings to the end, and governmental structures must be\ndesigned for such beings. Hanfei recommended a highly centralized\ngovernment in which the ruler retains firm control of the \u201dtwo\nhandles\u201c of government: punishment and favor (chapter 7). By\nmaking sure he always has his own hands on these handles, the ruler\nremains in firm control of his ministers. If a minister proposes a way\nto get something done, measure his performance on whether he gets it\ndone in the way he says he will. If not, punish him. The ruler is to\nhold his officials strictly to the definitions of their role\nresponsibilities, so that they are punished not only when they fail to\nperform some of those assigned responsibilities but also when they do\nmore than their assigned responsibilities.\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the text consist of arguments\nsupporting the necessity of governmental structure and the folly of\ndepending on the character of rulers. It\u2019s not just that virtue\nis a rare thing. Even if it appears in a ruler, it is not by itself\nsufficient for achieving a good society. The \u201dFive Vermin\u201c\nchapter (49) does not dispute an assumption that is commonly held\nacross Chinese philosophical schools\u2014that the sage-kings of\nancient times were virtuous and ruled over a harmonious and prosperous\nsociety. It disputes, however, that their virtue was the primary cause\nof this golden age. What about those kings in more recent times who\nwere ren and yi, benevolent and righteous, and who\ngot wiped out for their trouble? Virtue by itself is not the\nexplanation of success or failure. The explanation has much more to do\nwith the scarcity of goods in relation to the number of people. It\nfurther has to do with whether the right sort of structure of roles\nwith attendant powers and privileges is put into place. This structure\ncan optimize the effectiveness of, and limit the damage done by,\npeople who are not especially virtuous or extraordinarily able.\n\nConfucians can give replies to such arguments. In answer to the\nargument that virtue is too rare a thing to depend upon, the most\nobvious reply is that they never promised virtue would be easy.\nIndeed, the canonical texts all stress the difficulty of achieving\nfull virtue. Mencius in particular conceives of moral development as\nextending the natural beginnings of virtue to situations where they\nought to extend but do not currently extend. Confucians might also\nobject that good results will follow from the kind of structure\ndescribed in the Hanfeizi only if persons of good-enough\ncharacter staff it. The Hanfeizi sometimes implicitly\nacknowledges this point and integrates it with a reasonable stress on\nstructure and impersonal administration. In chapter 6 there is\ndiscussion of what is necessary to compensate for a mediocre ruler:\ngetting able people with the right motives to serve that ruler.\nInstitute laws and regulations specifying how these people are\nselected: not on the basis of reputation alone, since that will give\npeople an incentive to curry favor with their associates and\nsubordinates and disregard the ruler; not on the basis of cliques,\nsince that will motivate people only to establish connections rather\nthan acquire the qualifications to perform in office. Specify the\nqualifications clearly in laws and regulations, appoint, promote, and\ndismiss strictly according to these specifications. The law, not the\nruler\u2019s personal views, must form the basis for these actions.\nIn chapter 43, consideration is given to the suggestion that those who\ntake heads in battle should be rewarded with desirable offices. This\nis rejected in cases where the office requires wisdom and ability\nrather than courage. In the end, one wonders whether a good number of\nsuch persons of right motive, competence, courage, wisdom and ability\nare enough, given the highly centralized nature of the government\nrecommended in the Hanfeizi. A lot depends on the ruler who\nwields the \u201dtwo handles\u201c of government. Taken in moderate\ndoses, Hanfeizi arguably provides a needed corrective to the\nConfucian emphasis on character. Structure can be designed with an eye\nto the realistic possibilities for mediocre and bad rulers. The\nConfucian emphasis on discretion in judgment is obviously subject to\nabuse that can be checked by structures that provide a degree of\nimpersonal administration and consistent application of relatively\nclear laws and regulations. The American legal experience seems to\nshow, however, that no set of laws can interpret itself with an eye to\ncomplex situations that are unforeseeable when laws are framed.\nUltimately, stable character and wise discretion are needed.\n\nThe strongest challenge that Legalism raises to virtue ethics is not\nthat stable virtues are impossible to achieve, but that they are not\nrealistic possibilities for most persons, and that therefore lofty\nvirtue ideals cannot provide the basis for a large-scale social ethic.\nEven if these ideals are directed only at an elite that is then\nexpected to lead the rest of the people, the question arises as to\nwhat influence this elite can have on the rest if the majority do not\nhave some attraction to virtue. It is dubious, however, that the\nsolution lies in seeking to make character irrelevant. For a more\nextensive discussion of the Fajia thinkers,\nsee the entry on\n  legalism in Chinese philosophy, \n6. Chinese Buddhist Ethics\n\nBuddhism is not indigenous to China, and it has a long and rich\ntradition of thought and practice in India and in areas other than\nChina. This brief section will focus on ethical aspects of the most\ndistinctive form of Buddhism that developed once it was introduced to\nChina: Chan Buddhism, or as it came to be known later in Japan, Zen.\nIt should be noted, however, that prominent forms of Chinese Buddhism\nalso include Tiantai and Huayan. All three forms of Chinese Buddhism\ndeveloped in interaction with indigenous Chinese thought, especially\nDaoism. Chan developed partly as a response to the perception of some\nChinese Buddhists that Tiantai and Huayan had developed in overly\nscholastic directions with proliferating metaphysical distinctions and\ndoctrines that hinder rather than aid Enlightenment.\n\nThe immediate focus of Buddhist ethics is the problem of suffering,\nand a conception of the self is at the heart of the Buddhist response\nto that problem. The self is conceived as a floating collection of\nvarious psychophysical reactions and responses with no fixed center or\nunchanging ego entity. The usual human conception of self as a fixed\nand unchanging center is a delusion. Our bodily attributes, various\nfeelings, perceptions, ideas, wishes, dreams, and in general a\nconsciousness of the world display a constant interplay and\ninterconnection that leads us to the belief that there is some\ndefinite \u2018I\u2019 that underlies and is independent of the\never-shifting series. But there is only the interacting and\ninterconnected series. Human suffering ultimately stems from a concern\nfor the existence and pleasures and pains of the kind of self that\nnever existed in the first place. Recognition of the impermanence of\nthe self can lead to release or mitigation of suffering, but the\nrecognition cannot merely be intellectual. It must involve\ntransformation of one\u2019s desires. The belief on some abstract\nlevel, for example, that there are no permanent selves is a belief\nthat can co-exist with having and acting on intense desires to avoid\ndeath, as if death were some evil befalling some underlying\n\u2018I\u2019. Similarly, the intellectual recognition that none of\nthe \u201dthings\u201c of ordinary life are fixed and separate\nentities, anymore than the self is, can lead to recognition of all of\nlife as an interdependent whole and to the practical attitude of\ncompassion for all of life. But if the latter recognition is again\nmerely intellectual, one can still have and act on intensely\nself-regarding desires at severe cost to others. In both cases a\ntransformation of desire is what is required in order to go beyond the\nmerely intellectual and to achieve true Enlightenment and meaningful\nrecognition of one\u2019s true nature as impermanent and as\ninterdependent with all other things.\n\nRecall the practical focus and the closeness to pre-theoretical\nexperience that are distinctive of indigenous Chinese philosophy.\nThese traits interacted with Buddhism as it was introduced into China.\nThe \u2018Chan\u2019 in \u201dChan Buddhism\u201c comes from the\nSanskrit \u2018dhyana\u2019 which means meditation. Though\nmeditation practice is not the only practice employed in Chan, its\ncentral role does illustrate the focus on achieving transformation of\none\u2019s desires through experience of the self and the world. This\nkind of transformation is different than reaching intellectual\nconviction through textual study and understanding of argumentation,\nand also different than escape from the world of suffering through\nobliteration of one\u2019s consciousness as an individual being.\nChinese Buddhism in the form of Chan was especially influential in\nputting forward this conception of Enlightenment as lived in this\nworld rather than escaping from it.\n\nDaoism in particular has themes that make it especially appropriate\nfor interaction with Buddhism. Recall the theme that one must keep\ndesires from interfering with one\u2019s attention to the matter at\nhand. Correspondingly, a major theme in Chan is that all forms of\nstriving, especially the very striving for Enlightenment, interfere\nwith attention to one\u2019s true nature (Hui Neng, 638\u2013713,\nPlatform Scripture). Hence the reason for the otherwise\npuzzlingly harsh reactions of Chan masters to the earnest strivings of\ntheir students to reach Enlightenment (Yi Xuan, d. 866, The\nRecorded Conversations of Linji Yi Xuan) especially if such\nstrivings have any tinge of the academic or doctrinal about them\n(Huang Po, d. 850, The Transmission of Mind). Recall also the\ntheme in Daodejing concerning the dao as the source\nof the myriad things. The Buddha\u2019s insight into the nature of\nthe many things brought him to recognize the Many as also the One.\nFinally, recall the skeptical theme in Daoism about the limits of\nconceptualization. The Buddha\u2019s insight into the Many as also\nthe One does not mean that the Many are really only One, but rather\nMany and Once at once, and if we have difficulty making sense of that,\nit is founded in the limits of our conceptualization. Finally, there\nis the same possibility for ambiguity as to whether there is some\nineffable and nonconceptual access to an ultimate reality or whether\nthere is skeptical question that goes all the way down (or all the way\nup?). In the Zhuangzi this ambiguity is quite apparent. And\nthough Chan is usually taken to affirm a foundation in ineffable\naccess (Kasulis, 1986), there are those who argue that a thoroughgoing\nskepticism is truer to its spirit (Wright, 1998).\n\nSince the self is a bundle of changing psychological and physical\nattributes whose boundaries are conventionally established, and since\nits attributes exist only in relation to other things outside its\nconventionally established boundaries, it ought to dampen its\nself-regarding cares and concerns and widen the boundaries of its\nconcerns to embrace all life. This Buddhist reasoning certainly is an\ninteresting way to ground impersonal concern, and it may appeal to\nthose of us who see little plausibility in the idea of Cartesian\nsubstances as fixed ego entities. On the other hand, it\u2019s not clear\nthat a metaphysical deconstruction of an essential self assures that\ncare for all others is normatively required. Further, this reasoning\nmay seem to drain all passion from life, and it requires that we\ndampen the attachment we have not only to our selves but also to\nparticular others such as friends and family members. Buddhism is\nespecially well known for its advocacy of detachment, not only from\nmaterial possessions, worldly power and status, but also from\nparticular people and communities. For example, in Ashvaghosha\u2019s\npoem on \u201dNanda the Fair,\u201c the Buddha explains to Nanda\nthat delusion alone ties one person to another (Conze, 1959, 110). The\nargument is that a family is like a group of travelers at an inn who\ncome together for a while and then part. No one belongs to anyone\nelse. A family is held together only as sand is held in a clenched\nfist. A number of Neo-Confucians, such as the Cheng brothers and Zhu\nXi, harshly accused Buddhists of selfishness while not quite squaring\nthat accusation with the ideal of the Boddhisattvas in Mahayana\nBuddhism, who delay their entrance into Nirvana, their final release\nfrom suffering, until all beings are liberated from suffering. What\nthe neo-Confucians might have been saying is that the real appeal of\nBuddhism is to the selfish impulse to save oneself, regardless of what\ntheir doctrines say. \n\nBuddhist traditions are diverse, long-lived, and philosophically\nsophisticated in addressing these questions. Worries about the\ndesirability and realistic possibility of assuming the kind of\ndetached attitude the Buddhists upheld are similar to worries\nraised by Daoist identification with the cosmos. As the discussion of\nZhuangzi and wife suggests, it may be possible to distinguish as an\nalternative to the pure and complete detachment exemplified in\nAshvagosha another kind that is consistent with emotional involvement\nwith others for as long as they are given to us.",
