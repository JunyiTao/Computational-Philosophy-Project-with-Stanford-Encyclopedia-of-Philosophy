    "main_text": "The Nature of Delusion || Defining delusion\n2.1 Defining delusion\n\nDefinitions of delusions are based on the behavior we exhibit\nwhen experiencing a delusion rather than on the underlying mechanisms\nresponsible for our behavior. The behavior associated with having delusions\nis often described in epistemic terms, using concepts such as belief,\ntruth, rationality, evidence, and justification. For instance,\ndelusions may be defined as beliefs held\nwith conviction in spite of having little empirical\nsupport (where the epistemic concepts are in italics). According\nto the Glossary in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM-IV 2000, p. 765 and DSM-5 2013, p. 819), delusions\nare false beliefs based on incorrect inference about external reality\nthat persist despite evidence to the contrary:\n\nDelusion. A false belief based on incorrect inference about external\nreality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else\nbelieves and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious\nproof or evidence to the contrary. The belief is not one ordinarily\naccepted by other members of the person\u2019s culture or subculture\n(e.g., it is not an article of religious faith). When a false belief\ninvolves a value judgment, it is regarded as a delusion only when the\njudgment is so extreme as to defy credibility.\n\n\nPhilosophers interested in the nature of delusions have raised a\nnumber of questions about the DSM definition. According to the\nchallenges, the DSM definition of delusions cannot capture what is\ndistinctive about delusions, and does not tell us what makes them\npathological.\n\nDelusions are generally accepted to be beliefs which (a) are held with\ngreat conviction; (b) defy rational counter-argument; (c) and would be\ndismissed as false or bizarre by members of the same socio-cultural\ngroup. A more precise definition is probably impossible since\ndelusions are contextually dependent, multiply determined and\nmultidimensional. Exemplars of the delusion category that fulfil all\nthe usual definitional attributes are easy to find, so it would be\npremature to abandon the construct entirely. Equally, in everyday\npractice there are patients we regard as deluded whose beliefs in\nisolation may not meet standard delusional criteria. In this way a\ndelusion is more like a syndrome than a symptom. (Gilleen and David\n2005, pp. 5\u20136)\n\n\nCounterexamples are easily found to the DSM definition of delusion:\nthere are delusions that do not satisfy all of the proposed criteria,\nand there are irrational beliefs that do, even though they are not\ncommonly regarded as delusional. In the passage below, Coltheart\nsummarizes the main problems with the DSM definition:\n\n1. Couldn\u2019t a true belief be a delusion, as long as the believer\nhad no good reason for holding the belief? 2. Do delusions really have\nto be beliefs \u2013 might they not instead be imaginings that are\nmistaken for beliefs by the imaginer? 3. Must all delusions be based\non inference? 4. Aren\u2019t there delusions that are not about\nexternal reality? \u2018I have no bodily organs\u2019 or \u2018my\nthoughts are not mine but are inserted into my mind by others\u2019\nare beliefs expressed by some people with schizophrenia, yet are not\nabout external reality; aren\u2019t these nevertheless still\ndelusional beliefs? 5. Couldn\u2019t a belief held by all members of\none\u2019s community still be delusional? (Coltheart 2007, p. 1043)\n\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has\nbeen updated through the years and although no changes appear in the\nGlossary, some interesting shifts can be noted in the description of\ndelusions which appear in the section on schizophrenia (compare\nDSM-IV, p. 275 and DSM-IV-TR p. 299 with DSM-5, p. 87). The new\ndescription seems to take into account some of the issues identified\nby Coltheart and others. For instance, in the DSM-5 delusions are\ndescribed not as false, but as \u201cfixed beliefs that are not\namenable to change in light of conflicting evidence\u201d. Leaving\nthe details aside, some general comments apply to the style of the DSM\ndefinitions and descriptions of delusions. In so far as delusions are\ndefined and described as irrational beliefs, it is difficult for them\nto be uniquely identified because their epistemic \u2018faults\u2019\nare shared with other symptoms of psychiatric disorders, and with\nnon-pathological beliefs. But definitions such as the ones in the DSM\ncannot probably be expected to provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the phenomena they aim to define. At best, they can\nprove diagnostically useful and guide further research by conveniently\ndelimiting an area of investigation worth pursuing.\n\nA widespread critique of the DSM definition is that not enough weight\nis given to the consequences of having the delusion for our wellbeing. Some other definitions of delusion make\nexplicit reference to \u201cdisrupted functioning\u201d (e.g., McKay\net al. 2005a, p. 315). Freeman 2008 (pp. 24\u201326)\nhighlights the multi-dimensional nature of delusions and lists among\nthe main characteristics of delusions not just that delusions are\nunfounded, firmly held, and resistant to change, but also that they\nare preoccupying and distressing, and that they interfere with the\nsocial dimension of our lives.\n",
