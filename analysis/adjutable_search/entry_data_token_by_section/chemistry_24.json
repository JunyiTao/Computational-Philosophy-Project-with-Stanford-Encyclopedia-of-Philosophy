    "main_text": "Chemical Reduction || Reduction of Substances to Molecular Species\n6.2 Reduction of Substances to Molecular Species\n\nSo far we have considered intertheoretic relationships between\nchemistry and physics. What about within chemistry itself? Do the\nmacroscopic and microscopic theories of chemistry align perfectly? Are\nall macroscopic properties of substances ultimately reducible to\nmicroscopic properties? In other words, if we have a macroscopic\ndescription of matter and a thermodynamic theory about how it behaves,\ncan all of this be reduced to a molecular description? The answer has\nseemed to be \u201cyes\u201d to many philosophers and chemists, but\nphilosophers of chemistry have urged caution here.\n\nConsider first the relatively simple case of gas temperature, which\nhas often been supposed reducible to the average kinetic energy of the\ngas\u2019s molecules (cf. Nagel 1961, p. 343). A particular average\nkinetic energy of the molecules is only a necessary condition for\nhaving a given temperature, however. Only gases at equilibrium have a\ndefinite temperature, when all the spatial parts have the same\ntemperature as the whole (reflecting the fact that temperature is an\nintensive property). A sufficient condition would need to complement\nthe average kinetic energy with a microscopic correlate of the\nmacroscopic condition of being at thermodynamic equilibrium.\nStatistical mechanics specifies the relevant correlative condition as\nthat of the energy being distributed over the gas molecules in\naccordance with the Boltzmann distribution. But the Boltzmann\ndistribution is expressed as a function of the temperature, and its\nderivation from Boltzmann\u2019s microscopic construal of entropy appeals\nto the thermodynamic law connecting entropy with temperature.\nAccordingly, the necessary and sufficient microscopic condition for\ngas temperature becomes circular when construed as a reduction of the\nconcept of temperature (Needham 2009b; Bishop 2010)\n\nAlthough the reduction of temperature to microscopic properties is\nproblematic, it is a relatively easy candidate for reduction.\nProperties concerned with chemical changes such as phase transitions,\nsolubility, and reactivity, are considerably more complex. As we\ndiscussed in Section 4.5, a purely microscopic description of matter\nis not coextensive with all chemical properties. Solubility, for\nexample, is not fully explained by microscopic properties. While we\ncan explain in rough qualitative fashion that substances dissolve when\ntheir ions or molecules have more affinity for the solvent than they\ndo for each other, this doesn\u2019t recover the subtle, quantitative\nfeatures of solubility. It also leaves the solubility of nonionic\nsubstances untouched. Predicting these features requires appeals to\nthermodynamics, and the alleged reduction of thermodynamics to\nstatistical mechanics is considered highly contentious (Sklar\n1993).\n\nAs we have seen in this case, even very fruitful applications of\nphysical and chemical theory at the microscopic level are often\ninsufficient to reduce chemically important properties. Whether the\ngeneral notion of chemical substance, or the property of being a\nparticular substance for each of the millions of known substances, can\nbe reduced to microstructure needs to be demonstrated and not merely\nassumed. While there is no in-principle argument that reductions will\nalways be impossible, essential reference is made back to some\nmacroscopically observable chemical property in every formal attempt\nof reduction that we are aware of. In the absence of definite\narguments to the contrary, it seems reasonable to suppose that\nchemistry employs both macroscopic and microscopic concepts in\ndetailed theories which it strives to integrate into a unified view.\nAlthough plenty of chemistry is conducted at the microscopic level\nalone, macroscopic chemical properties continue to play important\nexperimental and theoretical roles throughout chemistry.\n\nIn the background of all of these debates about chemical reduction are\nissues concerning the criteria for successful reduction. All of the\nliterature that we have discussed make explicit or implicit reference\nto Nagel\u2019s influential account of reduction. Beyond the philosophy of\nchemistry literature, this account has also been presupposed by\ncritics of particular reductionist theses (e.g. Davidson 1970), even\nwhen making points about the inapplicability of Nagel\u2019s account to\nparticular sciences (Kitcher 1984). But Nagel\u2019s account of reduction\nis thought by many to be unrealistic and inapplicable to actual\nscience because of the logical requirements it assumes.\n\nPerhaps part of the anti-reductionist consensus in the philosophy of\nchemistry literature is driven by the stringent demands of Nagel\u2019s\naccount. But even if Nagel\u2019s account is weakened to allow\napproximative arguments (as Hempel modified his DN model of\nexplanation), as some advocates of reductionism have urged (e.g.,\nSchaffner 1967; Churchland 1985), this still doesn\u2019t circumvent the\nproblem of the appeal to macroscopic properties in the explanation of\nmicroscopic properties. Current chemical theory makes essential\nreference to both microscopic and macroscopic chemical concepts with\nboth chemical and quantum mechanical origins. We know of no convincing\nsubstantial examples where either of these aspects have been entirely\nexcised.\n",
