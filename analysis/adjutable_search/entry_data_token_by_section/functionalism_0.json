    "main_text": "What is Functionalism?\n1. What is Functionalism?\n\nFunctionalism is the doctrine that what makes something a thought,\ndesire, pain (or any other type of mental state) depends not on its\ninternal constitution, but solely on its function, or the role it\nplays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part. More precisely,\nfunctionalist theories take the identity of a mental state to be\ndetermined by its causal relations to sensory stimulations, other\nmental states, and behavior.\n\nFor (an avowedly simplistic) example, a functionalist theory might\ncharacterize pain as the state that tends to be caused by\nbodily injury, to produce the belief that something is wrong with the\nbody and the desire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and,\nin the absence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing\nor moaning. According to this theory, all and only creatures with\ninternal states that can meet this condition, or play this role, are\ncapable of being in pain, and an individual is in pain at time\nt if and only if they are in a state that is playing this\nrole at t.\n\nSuppose that, in humans, there is some distinctive kind of neural\nactivity (C-fiber stimulation, for example) that plays this role. If\nso, then according to this functionalist theory, humans can be in pain\nsimply by undergoing C-fiber stimulation. But the theory permits\ncreatures with very different physical constitutions to have mental\nstates as well: if there are silicon-based states of hypothetical\nMartians or inorganic states of hypothetical androids that also meet\nthese conditions, then these creatures, too, can be in pain. As\nfunctionalists often put it, pain can be realized by\ndifferent types of physical states in different kinds of creatures, or\nmultiply realized. (See entry on\n multiple realizability.)\n Indeed, since descriptions that make explicit reference only to a\nstate\u2019s causal relations with stimulations, behavior, and one\nanother are what have come to be known as \u201ctopic-neutral\u201d\n(Smart 1959) \u2013 that is, as imposing no logical restrictions on\nthe nature of the items that satisfy the descriptions \u2013 then\nit\u2019s also logically possible for non-physical states to\nplay the relevant roles, and thus realize mental states, in some\nsystems as well. So functionalism is compatible with the sort of\ndualism that takes mental states to cause, and be caused by, physical\nstates.\n\nStill, though functionalism is officially neutral between materialism\nand dualism, it has been particularly attractive to materialists,\nsince many materialists believe (or argue; see Lewis, 1966) that it is\noverwhelmingly likely that any states capable of playing the roles in\nquestion will be physical states. If so, then functionalism can stand\nas a materialistic alternative to the Psycho-Physical Identity Thesis\n(introduced in Place 1956, Feigl 1958, and Smart 1959, and defended\nmore recently in Hill 1991, and Polger 2011), which holds that each\ntype of mental state is identical with a particular type of\nneural state. This thesis seems to entail that no creatures\nwith brains unlike ours can share our sensations, beliefs, and\ndesires, no matter how similar their behavior and internal\norganization may be to our own, and thus functionalism, with its claim\nthat mental states can be multiply realized, has been regarded as\nproviding a more inclusive, less \u201c(species-) chauvinistic\u201d\n(Block 1980b) \u2013 theory of the mind that is compatible with\nmaterialism. (More recently, however, some philosophers have contended\nthat the identity thesis may be more inclusive than functionalists\nassume; see Section 6 for further discussion.)\n\nWithin this broad characterization of functionalism, however, a number\nof distinctions can be made. One of particular importance is the\ndistinction between theories in which the functional characterizations\nof mental states purport to provide analyses of the meanings of our\nmental state terms (or otherwise restrict themselves to a priori\ninformation), and theories that permit functional characterizations of\nmental states to appeal to information deriving from scientific\nexperimentation (or speculation). (See Shoemaker 1984c, and Rey 1997,\nfor further discussion and more fine-grained distinctions.) There are\nother important differences among functionalist theories as well.\nThese (sometimes orthogonal) differences, and the motivations for\nthem, can best be appreciated by examining the origins of\nfunctionalism and tracing its evolution in response both to explicit\ncriticisms of the thesis and changing views about the nature of\npsychological explanation.\n",
