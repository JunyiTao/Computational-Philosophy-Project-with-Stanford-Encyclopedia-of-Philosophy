    "main_text": "The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions || Rousseau: Toward Progressive Education\n1.3 Rousseau: Toward Progressive Education\n\nAlthough ancient Athens instituted democracy, her most famous\nphilosophers\u2014Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle\u2014were not great\nchampions of it. At best they were ambiguous about democracy; at\nworst, they were hostile toward it. The earliest unadulterated\nchampion of democracy, a \u201cdreamer of democracy,\u201d was\nundoubtedly Rousseau. Yet Rousseau had his doubts that men could be\ngood men and simultaneously good citizens. A good man for Rousseau is\na natural man, with the attributes of freedom, independence, equality,\nhappiness, sympathy, and love-of-self (amour de soi) found\nprior to society in the state of nature. Thus society could do little\nbut corrupt such a man.\n\nStill, Rousseau recognized that life in society is unavoidable, and so\ncivic education or learning to function well in society is also\nunavoidable. The ideal for Rousseau is for men to act morally and yet\nretain as much of their naturalness as possible. Only in this way can\na man retain his freedom; and only if a man follows those rules that\nhe prescribes for himself\u2014that is, only if a man is\nself-ruling\u2014can he remain free: \u201c\u2026[E]ach\nindividual\u2026obeys no one but himself and remains as free as\nbefore [society]\u201d (1988, 60).\n\nYet prescribing those rules is not a subjective or selfish act. It is\na moral obligation because the question each citizen asks himself or\nshould ask himself was not \u201cWhat\u2019s best for me?\u201d\nRather, each asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s best for all?\u201d When all\ncitizens ask this question and answer on the basis of what ought to be\ndone, then, says Rousseau, they are expressing and following the\ngeneral will. Enacting the general will is the only legitimately moral\nfoundation for a law and the only expression of moral freedom. Getting\nmen to ask this question and to answer it actively is the purpose of\ncivic education.\n\nShowing how to educate men to retain naturalness and yet to function\nin society and participate untouched by corruption in this direct\ndemocracy was the purpose of his educational treatise, Emile.\nIf it could be done, Rousseau would show us the way. To do it\nwould seem to require educating a man to be in society but\nnot of society; that is, to be \u201cattached to human\nsociety as little as possible\u201d (Ibid, 105).\n\nHow could a man for Rousseau be a good man\u2014meaning, for him a\nnaturally good man (1979, 93), showing his amour de soi and\nalso his natural compassion for others\u2014and also have the proper\nframe of mind of a good citizen to be able to transcend self-interest\nand prescribe the general will? How could this be done in society when\nsociety\u2019s influence is nothing but corrupting?\n\nRousseau himself seems ambivalent on exactly whether men can overcome\nsocial corruption. Society is based on private property; private\nproperty brings inequality, as some own more than others; such\ninequality brings forth social comparisons with others (amour\npropre), which in turn can produce envy, pride, and greed. Only\nwhen and if men can exercise their moral and political freedom and\nwill the general will can they be saved from the corrupting influences\nof society. Willing for the general will, which is the good for all,\nis the act of a moral or good person. Its exercise in the assembly is\nthe act of a good citizen.\n\nStill, Rousseau comments that if \u201c[f]orced to combat nature or\nthe social institutions, one must choose between making a man or a\ncitizen, for one cannot make both at the same time\u201d (Ibid, 39).\nThere seems little, if any, ambiguity here. One cannot make both a man\nand a citizen at the same time. Yet on the very next page of\nEmile Rousseau raises the question of whether a man who\nremains true to himself, to his nature, and is always decisive in his\nchoices \u201cis a man or a citizen, or how he goes about being both\nat the same time\u201d (Ibid, 40).\n\nPerhaps the contradiction might be resolved if we emphasize that a man\ncannot be made a man and a citizen at the\nsame time, but he can be a man and a citizen\nat the same time. Rousseau hints at this distinction when he says of\nhis educational scheme that it avoids the \u201ctwo contrary\nends\u2026the contrary routes\u2026these different\nimpulses\u2026[and] these necessarily opposed objects\u201d (Ibid,\n40, 41) when you raise a man \u201cuniquely for himself.\u201d What,\nthen, will he be for others? He will be a man and a citizen, for the\n\u201cdouble object we set for ourselves,\u201d those contradictory\nobjects, \u201ccould be joined in a single one by removing the\ncontradictions of man\u2026\u201d (Idem). Doubtless, this will be a\nrare man, but raising a man to live a natural life can be done.\n\nOne might find the fully mature, and natural, Emile an abhorrent\nperson. Although \u201cgood\u201d in the sense of doing his duty and\nacting civilly, he seems nevertheless without imagination or deep\ncuriosity about people or life itself\u2014no interest in art or many\nbooks or intimate social relationships. Is his independence fear of\ndependence and thus built on an inability ever to be interdependent?\nIs he truly independent, or does he exhibit simply the appearance of\nindependence, while the tutor \u201cremains master of his\nperson\u201d (Ibid, 332)?\n\nWhatever one thinks of Rousseau\u2019s attempt to educate\nEmile\u2014whether, for example, the tutor\u2019s utter control of\nEmile\u2019s life and environment is not in itself a betrayal of\neducation\u2014Rousseau is a precursor of those progressive educators\nwho seek to permit children to learn at their own rate and from their\nown experiences, as we shall see below.\n",
