    "main_text": "Consciousness and Self-Consciousness\n7. Consciousness and Self-Consciousness\n\nOne could see the question of how consciousness relates to\nself-consciousness as opening up a further dimension of potential\ncognitive richness to investigate: here again one may contrast those\nwho find more and those who find less in\nexperience\u2014the former finding in it this or that form of\nself-consciousness where the latter do not. But these issues\nexhibit a unity and complexity of their own, and an importance that\ncalls for separate treatment. To prepare to survey some ways they have\nfound expression in recent philosophy, we may recall three questions\nabout the alleged reflexivity of consciousness that were earlier\nidentified in phenomenological writings. The first asks in what sense\nif any, when there is a conscious state, there must be consciousness\nof it. The second asks whether it is only\noccasionally, in reflection, that a conscious state\nis simultaneously an intentional object for the one whose\nstate it is. Third, there is the question of whether consciousness\nordinarily somehow involves a non-reflective consciousness of\noneself\u2014as subject. These questions may be seen in the\ncontext of understanding the consciousness-intentionality\nrelationship, insofar as self-consciousness may be considered a kind\nof intentional directedness either to one\u2019s own states of mind,\nor one\u2019s self, or perhaps, an aspect of conscious intentionality\ndirected at other things.\n\nIn recent analytic philosophy of mind, higher-order and\nself-representationalist theorists of consciousness (of the sort\nmentioned in Section 1) combine an affirmative answer to the first of\nthe three questions above with a negative answer to the second. Their\ntheories typically work from the idea it is a necessary to any\nconscious state that one who is in that state be conscious of\nit\u2014where to say one is conscious of something implies it is\nsomehow an intentional, or represented object. In this respect they\nresemble Brentano, and are unlike Husserl and other phenomenologists\nin how they view the consciousness/self-consciousness relationship.\nBut unlike Brentano, they use this stance as the springboard for a\nreductive intentionalist theory of consciousness, ultimately to be put\nat the service of a physicalist conception of mind. What it is for a\nstate to be conscious can be fully explained by specifying the right\nsorts of representation and mental target\u2014where what these are\ncan be ultimately cashed out in non-mental, non-intentional terms. If\none form of self-consciousness consists in being conscious of\none\u2019s own states of mind\u2014these reductive\nreflexivist theories could be said to claim that state consciousness\ngenerally is explained by being reduced to what we might call\n\u201cstate self-consciousness\u201d.\n\nThe advent of such theories accounts for much recent attention to the\nrelationship between one\u2019s manner of being conscious of\none\u2019s own conscious states and the fact that they are conscious.\nBut there are other reasons for interest. One may well think it is in\nthe nature of conscious states to be available for a distinctively\nfirst-person reflective self-consciousness\u2014when they occur in\nbeings capable of reflection\u2014and that this involves a form of\nthought that cannot arise in the absence of its object. This way of\ndrawing a close connection between consciousness and\nself-consciousness can be found, for example, in\n\u201cacquaintance\u201d theories of self-knowledge (Gertler 2012a)\nand certain interpretations of the notion of \u201cphenomenal\nconcepts\u201d (Chalmers 2010), as well as other accounts of how we\nknow our own minds (Smithies 2012a, 2019; Siewert 2012b, 2014). But\nthese ideas involve no commitment to claiming that what makes a state\nconscious is its being represented in a special way in the very mind\nto which it belongs. Their positive philosophical significance lies\nnot in supporting a reductive intentionalism, but in their efforts to\nelucidate the distinctive way we understand ourselves, grounded in an\ninterpretation of consciousness.\n\nHowever, it is suitable here to focus on theories that do hold that\nwhat makes a state conscious is being an object of the right sort of\nrepresentation, since these lie close to the concerns that have most\ndominated philosophy of mind over the last fifty years or so. And, in\nany case, they raise issues about the relationship of consciousness\nand self-consciousness whose interest goes beyond their immediate\nconnection with these theories. It will first be useful to note some\nof the different forms these theories may take. They differ, for\ninstance, on the question of whether the conscious-making\nrepresentation and its target are distinct states, or collapse into\none. The latter option identifies consciousness with a certain sort of\nmental self-representation (Kriegel 2009), while the\n\u201chigher-order theory\u201d label is sometimes reserved for\naccounts of the former type. Another important fork in the road for\nsuch accounts: whether they propose that the targeting representation\naims at its target in a \u201cthought-like\u201d manner, or in a\n\u201cperception-like\u201d manner. To take the first option is to\nendorse (like Rosenthal 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002b, and Weisberg 2011) a\n\u201chigher-order thought\u201d theory of consciousness; to take\nthe second, a \u201chigher-order perception\u201d (or an\n\u201cinner sense\u201d) theory (as is found in Armstrong 1968,\nCarruthers 2004, and Lycan 1995, 2004). Kriegel, for his part,\nentertains the idea that the right sort of targeting representation is\nproperly regarded as neither thought-like or sensory, but sui\ngeneris. Here it becomes clear how some distinction between what\nproperly belongs to thought, and what to the senses\n(in the last section seen to figure centrally in disputes about\ncognitive richness), also figures crucially in articulating and\nassessing different metacognitive theories of consciousness.\n\nSuch theories can also differ with respect to what they regard as a\nsuitable candidate state. Is any type of mental state fair game for\nbeing made conscious by being represented, or only sensory\n\u201cqualitative\u201d states? Here we see how higher-order and\nself-representationalist theories might make consciousness cognitively\nrich in one way (by including metacognition in it\nconstitutively), while making it cognitively sparse in\nanother (only sensory states need apply).\n\nProponents of such accounts sometimes explicitly deny that they aim to\nexplain the \u201cqualitative character\u201d of experience in terms\nof higher-order or self-representations. This might lead one to think\nthat they are not trying to give a theory of phenomenal\nconsciousness at all\u2014on the assumption that a theory of that\nwould be a theory of \u201cqualia\u201d. However, they do\npurport to explain generally, in metarepresentational terms, what\nit\u2019s like for one to be in a state of mind. And they\ndon\u2019t appear to treat the phenomenal separately, under the\n\u201cqualitative\u201d label. This is especially clear when (as in\nRosenthal) qualitative states are illustrated by examples\ncommonly regarded as paradigmatically non-phenomenal: unfelt\npains, for example, and \u201cblindsight\u201d vision. Thus it seems\nfair to regard these accounts as proposing a reductive intentionalism\nabout phenomenal character\u2014pursuing a reflexivist strategy\nanalogous to that noted in the non-reflexivist accounts of\nTye and Prinz. One starts with some way of classifying mental states\nthat is understood as applying to states of mind regardless of whether\nthere is anything it\u2019s like for one to have\nthem\u2014regardless of whether they have phenomenal character. Then,\nconsciousness (phenomenal character, subjective \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlikeness\u201d) is supplied by adding in further representational\nfactors\u2014though in the reflexivist story, the extra ingredient\ncomes in having the states themselves be represented in the right way.\nSo, for example, in Rosenthal\u2019s higher-order thought theory,\nwhat it is for a pain to feel to you as it does is for you to have\npain (of a type that can occur unfelt), when (seemingly without\ninference) the thought occurs to you that you do.\n\nAn important inspiration for such theories lies in the idea that,\npre-theoretically or commonsensically, we are inclined to endorse the\nidea that conscious states are states we are conscious of. One takes\nthis to have the status of a necessary truth pertaining to all\nconscious states, and gives it a representationalist construal. This\nyields the starting point: some sort of higher-order or\nself-representation is necessary for a state to be conscious\nin a pre-theoretically recognized sense. We also have reason to\nbelieve mental states can occur unconsciously. So maybe: targeting\npotentially unconscious mental states with the right sort of\nrepresentation necessary for them to be conscious will also yield a\ncondition sufficient for them to be so, and reveal what it is\nto be a conscious state.\n\nSuch theories\u2019 advocates also draw on interpretation of the idea\nthat conscious states are ones there is something it\u2019s like for\nyou to be in\u2014arguing that what it\u2019s like for you to be in\na state is best construed in terms of how you represent that\nstate. (Carruthers 2004; Lycan 1995, 2004; Rosenthal 2002, 2019).\nRosenthal argues his higher-order thought variant version of the view\nhas a particular advantage in this regard, since it can account for\nhow what it\u2019s like for you to have sensory states can be\ntransformed, when you learn to classify sensory states via new\nconcepts (as, for example, when you learn to discriminate how wine\ntastes to you in a connoisseur\u2019s terms). This transformation is\nbest explained, he argues, on the assumption that what you\nthink about your gustatory state just constitutes\nwhat it\u2019s like for you to have it.\n\nAdditional arguments for metacognitive accounts of consciousness\nappeal to their alleged explanatory value. For example, Rosenthal\nargues that the fact that our conscious states comprise the part of\nthe our minds available for our first-person report is best explained\nby supposing they are always objects of thoughts of the kind such\nreports would express. And advocates of higher-order perception or\ninner sense versions of the metacognitive approach argue that such\nviews best explain our capacity to attend to our own experience\nintrospectively (Lycan 2004), and to form \u201crecognitional\nconcepts\u201d of our own sensory states (Carruthers 2004).\n\nThese strategies of argument have all occasioned criticism. One may\ndoubt whether commonsense really does support the requisite\ninterpretation of the idea on which the theories ground their appeal\n(i.e., the idea that conscious states are states we are conscious of)\n(Prinz 2012; Siewert 1998, 2013b). One may even doubt whether that\nidea should be endorsed on any construal; according to\nDretske 1995, conscious states are not states we are conscious\nof, but states we are conscious with. The\nmetacognitive interpretation of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\nlocution has also been criticized (see Byrne 2004; Siewert 2013b; and\nStoljar, forthcoming), as have some of the above appeals to\nexplanatory value (Siewert 1998, 2012). And one may doubt whether\nreflection supports the sorts of self-attributions posited by the\ntheory. With respect to the higher-order thought theory: whenever I\nfeel pain, does it in fact occur to me that I am in pain in\nRosenthal\u2019s sense (a sense in which one can be in pain without\nfeeling anything)? With respect to the inner sense view: when I feel\nnauseated, do I find there is some way the feeling is sensed,\ndistinguishable both from how I feel, and from what I think about it\n(Siewert 1998, 2012b)?\n\nOne venerable concern about metacognitive theories of consciousness\nfocuses on the prospect of an infinite regress. We have seen how\nBrentano addresses this concern, recently renewed in connection with\ncontemporary theories (see Kriegel 2009 and Siewert 2013b). The worry\nis roughly this. The theories assume we cannot be in a conscious state\nwithout being representationally or intentionally conscious\nof it. But it seems at least as compelling that an\nunconscious state cannot make one conscious of something. Putting both\nassumptions together appear to lead to the idea that every conscious\nstate must be represented by a conscious state that makes it\nconscious. But does this not generate a vicious infinite regress of\nrepresentations? Kriegel\u2019s favored response resembles\nBrentano\u2019s: we cut off the regress by means of the notion of\nself-representation: conscious states necessarily point at themselves,\nand the self-pointing is conscious\u2014not by being the object of a\nfurther act of pointing\u2014but by being one with what it points at.\nOther defenders of metacognitive approaches (Carruthers, Lycan,\nRosenthal) respond to the regress problem differently: they reject the\nintuition that you can\u2019t be conscious of things by unconsciously\nperceiving them or thinking of them. So on Rosenthal\u2019s view,\ntypically we are conscious of our vision (and it is conscious)\nbecause, as it occurs, we unconsciously think it does.\n\nAnother traditional line of criticism (also addressed by Brentano),\nspecifically targets the idea that all consciousness involves\n\u201cthought-like\u201d metacognition. Does such thought not\nrequire the ability to classify one\u2019s own states of\nmind\u2014to bring them under concepts? Such conceptualization seems\nto imply a level of cognitive sophistication one may doubt belongs to\nneonate human beings and many nonhuman animals. But in harboring such\ndoubts, we shouldn\u2019t take ourselves to question whether these\ncreatures have any sensory consciousness at all\u2014e.g., whether\ncolors look somehow to them, or whether they feel pain (Seager 2004;\nSiewert 1998). So we shouldn\u2019t think consciousness requires\nhigher-order thought. In response, some would not flinch at simply\nkeeping the cognitive bar high for thought, and embrace doubts about\nanimals and babies feeling pain (Carruthers 1989). The other option is\nto set the metacognitive bar low. Brentano ([1874] 1973:\n141\u2013142) took that route: again, for him judgment is the mere\naffirmation of a presented object. This requires nothing so fancy as\npredicating of the object affirmed something one takes it to share\nwith others. So there really is no cognitive ability involved in\njudgments aimed at one\u2019s own sensory states that we can\nreasonably doubt young children possess. Rosenthal offers a different\nversion of the \u201clow bar\u201d response, proposing that it is\nenough to have lowgrade concepts of one\u2019s own sensory states\nthat one can make certain fairly primitive nonverbal discriminatory\nresponses to them; the idea is that creatures apply such concepts to\nthemselves whenever they feel something. A question facing \u201clow\nbar \u201d views is to explain why, if thought of sensation comes so\neasily, we should take it to be absent in cases of unconscious\nperception (such as blindsight, and unfelt pain).\n\nA final important source of challenges to metacognitive theories of\nconsciousness concerns the fallibility of the posited representations.\nWhat should we say when your higher-order or self-representation\nmisfires? If it misrepresents what sort of sensory state you\nare in, will the theory claim this makes you feel just as you do when\nactually in that sort of state? Will it say, for instance, that when\none falsely thinks one is in pain what this is like for one\nis the same as what it\u2019s like to actually feel pain?\nSome critics\u2014Block 2011, Neander 1998\u2014regard the problems\nraised by misrepresentation as profound. From a Brentanian\nperspective, however, the envisaged problem simply cannot arise. The\ninevitable affirmation of one\u2019s conscious sensation infallibly\naffirms it as presented, and it cannot be presented as other than it\nis\u2014and, since such judgment does not really categorize\nthe sensation at all, it cannot miscategorize it. By\ncontrast, contemporary accounts tend to allow that the relevant form\nof metacognition can represent you to be in a sensory state you\naren\u2019t actually in. They then seek to make acceptable what the\ntheories imply\u2014for instance, that the way one feels can be\nconstituted out of false self-attributions of sensation, and that one\ncan feel pain by being conscious of pain, though there is in fact no\nstate of which one is thus conscious (see Rosenthal 2011; Weisberg\n2011).\n\nIn this section the issue of how consciousness is related to\nself-consciousness has been seen as a question of how it is related to\n\u201cstate self-consciousness\u201d. But we may also see this issue\nas encompassing the question of how consciousness is related to\nconsciousness of self \u201cas subject\u201d\u2014what we might\ncall \u201csubject self-consciousness\u201d\u2014a question earlier\nbroached in the survey of prominent phenomenologists. Views on this\ntopic are discussed in the supplement\n Consciousness of Self.\n",
