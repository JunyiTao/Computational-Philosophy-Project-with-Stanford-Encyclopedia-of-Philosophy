The principles that govern them are central in the development\nof the syllogistic, both categorical and hypothetical. It is not\nsurprising, in light of the complexity of Avicenna\u2019s analysis of\ncategorical propositions and of his elaborate account of quantified\nhypotheticals, that his answers to questions such as what contradicts\nwhat, what follows from what, and what converts with what all\ncame under close scrutiny in Post-Avicennan logic, before finding a\nstable equilibrium with K\u0101tib\u012b (d. 1276 CE), an equilibrium that turns\nin several key respects on the interpretation of these relations.\n",
