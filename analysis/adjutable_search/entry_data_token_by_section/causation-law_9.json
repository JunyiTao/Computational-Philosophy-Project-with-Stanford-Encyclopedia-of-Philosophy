    "main_text": "Combining These Three Sources into a Concept of Causation in the Law || The variety of proximate cause tests in the law\n5.3 The variety of proximate cause tests in the law\n\nIt was useful in taxonomizing the seven variations of the\ncounterfactual test to show how such variations were produced in\nresponse to problems perceived to exist for the first variation, which\nwas the simple, unmodified counterfactual test. While there is no test\nof proximate causation that is comparably dominant in law (even if\nonly in lip service) to the counterfactual test of cause-in-fact, it\nis nonetheless useful to display the various proximate cause tests as\nthey react to problems in other tests of proximate causation. Some\ndiscussion of standard problems with each version of the tests within\nlegal theory is thus included as we describe what motivates others of\nthe tests. \n\nThe basic taxonomizing principle here is to separate tests that do not\nview proximate causation as having anything to do with real causal\nrelations (the conventional view within legal theory) from tests that\nare motivated by the contrary thought. We shall begin with the former\nkind of test, what should be called policy-based proximate cause\ntests. Policy-based proximate cause tests are themselves usefully\ndivided into two camps. Some\u2014general policy tests\u2014are\njustified by their service of a wide range of policies, indeed, as\nwide as are the policies that justify liability at all in torts or\ncriminal law. By contrast, other tests are in the service of only one\npolicy: the measurement of the culpability of the actor in terms of\nthe mental state she had or should have had as she acted.\n\nBeginning with the general policy-based proximate cause tests: the\nfirst of these are what we may call \u201cad hoc policy\ntests\u201d. The idea is that courts balance a range of policies in\neach case that they adjudicate where a defendant has been found to\nhave caused-in-fact a legally prohibited harm. They may balance\ncertain \u201csocial interests\u201d, like the need for deterrence,\nwith certain \u201cindividual interests\u201d, like the unfairness\nof surprising a defendant with liability (Edgerton 1924). Courts then\ndecide wherever such balance leads. Whatever decision is reached on\nsuch case-by-case policy balancing is then cast in terms of\n\u201cproximate\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d cause. Such labels are\nsimply the conclusions of policy balances; the labels have nothing to\ndo with causation in any ordinary or scientific sense (Green\n1929).\n\nThe second sort of test here is one that adopts general rules of legal\ncausation. Such rules are adopted for various policy reasons also\nhaving nothing to do with causation, but such rules differ from the\nad hoc test by their eschewal of case-by-case balancing;\nrather, it is the per se rules of legal causation that are\nadopted for policy reasons. Thus, at common-law the rule for homicide\nwas that death must occur within a year and a day of the\ndefendant\u2019s harmful action, else he could not be said to have\nlegally caused the death. Analogously, the last wrongdoer rule of both\ntorts and criminal law held that when a single victim is mortally\nwounded by two or more assailants, acting seriatim over time and not\nin concert, only the last wrongdoer could be said to be the legal\ncause of the death. As a third example, tort law for a time observed\nwhat was called a \u201cfirst house rule\u201d, according to which a\nrailroad whose negligently emitted sparks burned an entire town was\nonly liable for the house or houses directly ignited by its sparks,\nnot for other houses ignited by the burning of those first burnt\nhouses (Ryan v. New York Central RR). There is no pretense of\nmaking truly causal discriminations by such rules; rather, such rules\nwere adopted for explicit reasons of legal policy. The first house\nrule, for example, was said to be justified by the policy of\nsubsidizing the then developing railroad industry by protecting it\nfrom a liability that was thought to be potentially ruinous in its\nextent.\n\nThe main problem with both ad hoc and rule-based policy tests\ndoes not lie with their \u201cfunctionalist\u201d approach (Cohen\n1935; 1937). to legal concepts such as causation, for we should always\nask after the purpose of the rule or institution in which a concept\nfigures in order to ascertain its legal meaning. Yet for anyone who\nthinks that criminal law and torts have dominant, justice-oriented\npurposes, the open-endedness of these policy tests will be\ndisqualifying. If retributive justice is the value served by criminal\nlaw, and if such justice requires that we grade punishment\nproportionately to causation, then criminal law\u2019s proximate\ncause tests should aid in finding when offenders really cause a harm.\nAnalogously, a tort law that uses causation to mark out those owing\nduties of corrective justice will limit those owing such duties of\ncompensation to those who have really caused the harms for which\ncompensation is sought. On such a view of tort law, proximate\ncausation should aid in separating those who really have caused a harm\nfrom those who have not. To serve both retributive and corrective\njustice, thus, the last thing one wants to do is to define legal\ncausation so that the label names a balance of values rather than the\nfactual state of affairs (real causation) that determines moral\nblameworthiness. The Legal Realists\u2019 explicit policy tests are\nanathema to any justice-oriented scheme of punishment or of\ncompensation.\n\nThis problem does not so obviously infect the next two policy-based\nproximate cause tests, the foreseeability and the harm-within-the-risk\ntests. For those tests do seek to describe a factual state of affairs\nthat plausibly determines both moral blameworthiness and connects a\ndefendant\u2019s culpability to particular harms. These tests are\nthus serving the kinds of policies that must be served by the concept\nof causation in justice-oriented theories of criminal law and of\ntorts. Their novelty lies in their relocation of how and where legal\ncausation determines fault. On these theories, \u201clegal\ncause\u201d is not a refinement of an admitted desert-determiner,\ntrue causation; it is rather a refinement of another admitted\ndesert-determiner, culpable state of mind.\n\nConsider first the well-known foreseeability test. Unlike the case\nwith the rule-based policy tests, here there is no multiplicity of\nrules for specific situations (like long drawn out processes of death,\nintervening wrongdoers, railroad fires, etc.). Rather, there is one\nrule universally applicable to all criminal and tort cases: was it\nforeseeable to a defendant at the time that she acted that her act\nwould cause the harm that it in fact caused? (Green 1967). This\npurportedly universal test for legal causation is usually justified by\none of two policies: either the unfairness of punishing (or extracting\ncompensation from) someone for harms that they could not foresee, or\nthe inability to gain any deterrence by sanctioning such actors (since\nthe threat value of tort or criminal law sanctions is commonly thought\nto be nonexistent for unforeseeable violations of liability\nrules).\n\nSome jurisdictions restrict the foreseeability test to one kind of\nsituation. When some human action or natural event intervenes between\nthe defendant\u2019s action and the harm, the restricted test asks\nnot whether the ultimate harm to the victim was foreseeable but\nrather, whether that intervening action or event was foreseeable to\nthe defendant when he acted. This restricted foreseeability test is\nlike the restricted rules we saw before and is unlike the universal\ntest of legal causation the foreseeability test usually purports to\nbe.\n\nPrecisely because it is a culpability test, the foreseeability test\nbecomes subject to its own policy-based objection. The objection is\nthat of redundancy. Why should we ask two culpability\nquestions in determining blameworthiness? After we have satisfied\nourselves that a defendant is culpable\u2014either because she\nintended or foresaw some harm, or because she was unreasonable in not\nforeseeing some harm, the foreseeability test bids us to ask\n\u201cWas the harm foreseeable?\u201d This is redundant, because any\nharm intended or foreseen is foreseeable, and any harm foreseeable\nenough to render an actor unreasonable for not foreseeing it, is also\nforeseeable.\n\nThe only way the foreseeability test avoids redundancy is by moving\ntoward the other alternative here, the harm-within-the-risk test. That\nis, the law could have said that in situations where the defendant was\nculpable in intending, foreseeing, or unreasonably risking some harm\ntype H, but what his act in fact caused was an instance of harm\ntype J, one should ask whether J was foreseeable, a\ndifferent question than the one asked and answered as a matter of\nmens rea (which was about H). Of course, H must\nbe \u201cclose\u201d to J for there to be a mind guilty with\nrespect to the harm for which responsibility is sought. Yet this is to\ndo the work of the harm-within-the-risk test, which is to solve what\nshould be called the \u201cfit problem\u201d of mens rea\n(fitting the harm actually done, J, to the harm foreseen,\nintended, or risked, H; Moore 2011a). Moreover, it is to do such work badly.\nForeseeability is not the right question to ask in order to fit the\nharm in fact caused by a defendant to the type of harm with respect to\nwhich she was culpable (either because she intended to achieve, or\nforesaw that she would cause, or unreasonably risked achieving, such a\nharm). If to avoid redundancy the foreseeability test is to be\nrestricted to this non-redundant work, it is better abandoned for the\nharm-within-the-risk test.\n\nLet us examine, then, this fourth policy-based proximate cause test,\nthe misleadingly labeled \u201charm-within-the-risk\u201d test. Like\nthe foreseeability test, this test purports to be a test of legal\ncause that is universally applicable to all tort and criminal cases.\nThis test, too, is justified on policy grounds and does not pretend to\nhave anything to do with factual or scientific causation. Doctrinally,\nhowever, the test differs from a simple foreseeability test.\n\nConsider first the arena from which the test takes its name, which is\nfrom crimes or torts of risk creation. If the defendant is\ncriminally charged with negligent homicide (or wrongful death in\ntorts), for example, this test requires that the death of the victim\nbe within the risk that made the actor\u2019s action negligent. If it\nwas negligent to drop a can of nitroglycerin because it might explode\nand kill the victim, but instead it kills him by cutting his toe and\ncausing him to bleed to death, then the harm that happened (bleeding)\nwas not within the risk of harm (explosion) that made it negligent to\ndrop the can (American Law Institute 1934). Similarly, if the charge\nis manslaughter (for which consciousness of the risk is required in\nsome jurisdictions), this test requires that the death of the victim\nbe within the risk the awareness of which made the defendant\u2019s\naction reckless.\n\nExtension of this test to non-risk-creation crimes or torts requires\nsome modification. For crimes or torts of strict liability, where no\nmens rea is required, the test requires that the harm that\nhappened be one of the types of harms the risk of which motivated the\nlawmaker to prohibit the behavior. For torts or crimes requiring\nknowledge (or \u201cgeneral intention\u201d) for their mens\nrea, the test asks whether the harm that happened was an instance\nof the type of harm the foresight of which by the defendant made her\nculpable. For torts or crimes requiring purpose (or \u201cspecific\nintent\u2019) for their mens rea, the test asks whether the\nharm that happened was an instance of the type of harm intended by the\ndefendant which intention made him culpable.\n\nWhat motivates all of these variations of the harm-within-the-risk\ntest is the following insight: when assessing culpable mens\nrea, there is always a \u201cfit problem\u201d. Suppose a defendant\nintends to hit his victim in the face with a stick; suppose further he\nintends the hit to put out the victim\u2019s left eye. As it happens,\nthe victim turns suddenly as she is being hit, and loses her right ear\nto the blow. Whether the harm that happened (right ear loss) is an\ninstance of the type of harm intended (left eye loss) is what is\ncalled the fit problem. Fact finders have to fit the mental state the\ndefendant had to the actual result he achieved and ask whether it is\nclose enough for him to be punished for a crime of intent like mayhem.\n(If it is not close enough, then he may yet be found guilty of some\nlesser tort or crime of battery or reckless endangerment.)\n\nThe essential claim behind the harm-within-the-risk test is that\n\u201clegal cause\u201d is the label lawyers should put on a problem\nof culpability, the problem called the fit problem. Proponents of this\ntest urge that legal cause, properly understood, is really a mens\nrea doctrine, not a doctrine of causation at all (American Law\nInstitute 1985).\n\nThe main problem for the harm-within-the-risk test does not lie in any\nof the directions we have just explored with respect to foreseeability\nas a test. The harm-within-the-risk test is in the service of a\njustice-oriented policy in its seeking of a true desert-determiner\n(culpable mental state), and it does not ask a redundant question. To\ngrade culpability by the mental states of intention, foresight, and\nrisk, we do have to match the harm done to the type of harm intended,\nforeseen, or unreasonably risked. The real questions for the\nharm-within-the-risk test are why this culpability question is\nlabelled as a problem of legal causation, and whether this\ngrading by culpable mental states is all that is or should be going on\nunder the rubric of \u201clegal cause\u201d.\n\nConsider this last question in light of two well-known sorts of legal\ncause cases. It is a time-honored maxim of criminal and tort law that\n\u201cyou take your victim as you find him\u201d. Standard\ntranslation: no matter how abnormal may be the victim\u2019s\nsusceptibilities to injury, and no matter how unforeseeable such\ninjuries may therefore be, a defendant is held to legally cause such\ninjuries. Hit the proverbial thin-skulled man, and you have legally\ncaused his death if he dies, no matter how rare his condition might\nbe. This is hard to square with the harm-within-the-risk test. A\ndefendant who intends to hit or to cut does not necessarily (or even\nusually) intend to kill. A defendant who foresees that his acts will\ncause the victim to be struck or cut, does not necessarily (or even\nusually) foresee that the victim will die. A defendant who negligently\nrisks that his acts will cause a victim to be struck or cut is not\nnecessarily (or even usually) negligent because he risked death.\n\nThe second sort of case involves what are often called\n\u201cintervening\u201d or \u201csuperseding\u201d causes. Suppose\nthe defendant sets explosives next to a prison wall intending to blow\nthe wall and to get certain inmates out. He foresees to a practical\ncertainty that the explosion will kill the guard on the other side of\nthe wall. He lights the fuse to the bomb and leaves. As it happens,\nthe fuse goes out. However, a stranger passes by the wall, sees the\nbomb, and relights the fuse for the pleasure of seeing an explosion;\nor, alternatively, lightning hits the fuse, reigniting it and setting\noff the bomb. When the guard on the other side of the wall is killed\nby the blast, standard doctrines of intervening causation hold that\nthe defendant did not legally cause the death of the guard. Yet this\nis hard to square with the result that seemingly should obtain under\nthe harm-within-the-risk test. After all, did not the defendant\nforesee just the type of harm an instance of which did occur? Because\nthe harm-within-the-risk question asks a simple type-to-token\nquestion\u2014was the particular harm that happened an instance of\nthe type of harm whose foresight by the defendant made him\nculpable\u2014the test is blind to freakishness of causal route\n(Moore 2009a: ch. 10).\n\nThe American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code modifies its\nadoption of the harm-within-the-risk test in section 2.03 by denying\nliability for a harm within the risk that is \u201ctoo remote or\naccidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the\nactor\u2019s liability or on the gravity of his offense\u201d\n(American Law Institute 1962). This language was not intended as a\ngeneral, stand-alone test of proximate causation, as it is sometimes\nconstrued to be (Dan-Cohen 1983). Rather, the language gives a\nqualifying caveat to the more general harm within the risk test of the\nModel Penal Code. Such a caveat is an explicit recognition of the\ninability of the harm-within-the-risk test to accommodate the issues\ncommonly adjudicated as intervening cause issues.\n\nSuch a recognition is not nearly broad enough to cover the inadequacy\nof the harm-within-the-risk approach. The basic problem with the test\nis that it ignores all the issues traditionally adjudicated\nunder the concept of legal cause. The test is blind not only to\nfreakishness of causal route in the intervening cause situations,\nblind not only to the distinction between antecedent versus\nafter-arising abnormalities so crucial to resolution of the\nthin-skulled man kind of issue, but the test also ignores all those\nissues of remoteness sought to be captured by Sir Francis\nBacon\u2019s coinage \u201cproximate causation\u201d. Even where\nthere is no sudden \u201cbreak\u201d in the chain of causation as in\nthe intervening cause cases, there is a strong sense that causation\npeters out over space and time. Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon\nmay well be a necessary condition for your reading of this essay, but\nso many other events have also contributed that Caesar\u2019s causal\nresponsibility has long since petered out. The logical relationship at\nthe heart of the harm-within-the-risk test\u2014\u201cwas the\nparticular harm that happened an instance of the type of harm whose\nrisk, foresight, or intention made the defendant\nculpable?\u201d\u2014is incapable of capturing this sensitivity to\nremoteness. As such, the harm-within-the-risk test is blind to the\nbasic issue adjudicated under \u201clegal cause\u201d. The\nharm-within-the-risk test asks a question that well serves\njustice-oriented theories of torts and criminal law, but it asks it in\nthe wrong place and in substitution of other questions needing an\nanswer for desert to be assessed.\n\nWe turn now from the policy-based tests of proximate causation to\nthose tests based on the view that proximate causation, like cause in\nfact, has to do with real causal relations in the world. The oldest of\nthese tests is that suggested by Sir Francis Bacon\u2019s coinage\n\u201ccausa proxima\u201d (1630: first maxim). The simple\nidea behind such a remoteness test is that causation is a scalar\nrelation\u2014a more-or-less sort of thing, not an all-or-nothing\nsort of thing\u2014and that it peters out over time.\n\nA criticism of the remoteness test, often voiced in the legal\nliterature, is that distance in space and remoteness in time are\nirrelevant to degrees of causal contribution. Examples like People\nv. Botkin, where poisoned candy went a great distance (from\nCalifornia to the victim in New Jersey), or an undetonated bomb left\nburied for many years before it explodes and injures a victim, are\ntrotted out in support of the criticism. Justice Cardozo rejoined that\nsuch criticism surely ran counter to strong community sentiment that\nspatiotemporal distance does matter to degrees of causal contribution\n(Bird v. St. Paul F. and Minneapolis Ins. Co.), but one would\nhope that one could do better than that. Spatiotemporal distance is\nperhaps a serviceable proxy for the number of events or states of\naffairs through which a cause exerts its influence on its effects, and\nthe number of events could be relevant to the degree of causal\ncontribution. This is the metaphysical view that causation\n\u201ctires\u201d through its links and that in this way the\nrelation is not fully a transitive one.\n\nA second and quite distinct kind of cause-based proximate cause test\nis the \u201cdirect cause\u201d test. Despite the name, this test\ndoes not require that there be a complete absence of any\nevent or state of affairs intervening between a cause and its effect,\nfor that cause to be \u201cdirect\u201d. Not even the ancient\ndirect/indirect distinction between the writs of trespass and\ntrespass-on-the-case in torts was this stringent in its requirement of\ndirectness (for trespass; Scott v. Shepard). On the contrary,\nchains can be sufficiently direct for the direct cause test\neven though they are quite long chains extending over considerable\nspace and time. It is only if a special kind of event\u2014an\n\u201cintervening\u201d (aka \u201csuperseding\u201d,\n\u201cextraneous\u201d) cause\u2014intervenes that the chain is\ninsufficiently direct. The heart of the direct cause test is thus the\nidea that there are these chain-breaking, intervening causes.\n\nBeginning with a series of articles in the 1950s and culminating in\ntheir massive book of 1959, Causation in the Law, second\nedition 1985, Herbert Hart and Tony Honor\u00e9 sought to describe\nthe idea of intervening causation that they saw the law adopting from\neveryday causal idioms. One can see their concept most easily in three\nsteps. First, presuppose some version of the counterfactual analysis:\na cause is at least a necessary condition for its effect, or perhaps a\nNESS condition (Honor\u00e9 1997). Second, a cause is not just\nany necessary condition; rather, out of the plethora of\nconditions necessary for the happening of any event, only two sorts\nare eligible to be causes rather than mere \u201cbackground\nconditions:\u201d free, informed, voluntary human actions, and those\nabnormal conjunctions of natural events we colloquially refer to as\n\u201ccoincidences\u201d. Third, such voluntary human action and\nabnormal natural events cause a given effect only if some other\nvoluntary human action or abnormal natural event does not intervene\nbetween the first such event and its putative effect. Such salient\nevents, in other words, are breakers of causal chains\n(\u201cintervening causes\u201d) as much as they are initiators of\ncausal chains, so if they do intervene they relegate all earlier such\nevents to the status of mere background conditions.\n\nHart and Honor\u00e9 built on considerable case-law support for\ntheir two candidates for intervening causes (Carpenter 1932,\n1940\u201343; Eldredge 1937). Indeed, it is arguable that the basic\ndistinction between principal and accomplice liability in criminal law\ndepends in large part on this conceptualization of causation (Kadish\n1985), as does the tort law distinction between \u201cin\nconcert\u201d and \u201cconcurrent causer\u201d kinds of joint\ntort-feasors. One worry for this view of causation, nonetheless, is\nthat it is incomplete with respect to the remoteness range of issues\nusually dealt with under the rubric of \u201clegal cause\u201d in\nthe law. Causation in the law fades out gradually as much it breaks\noff suddenly, and the direct cause analysis ignores this.\n",
