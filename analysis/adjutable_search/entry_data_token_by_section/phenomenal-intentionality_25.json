    "main_text": "Challenges for PIT || Wide intentional states\n6.3 Wide intentional states\n\nWide intentional states are intentional states that depend on\nrelations to items in our environments. They are states for which externalism is true\n(see\n section 4.3). Prime candidates of wide\nintentional states are thoughts about natural kinds (e.g.,\nH2O) and thoughts about individual objects (e.g., Bill Gates).\nArguably, subjects that are phenomenally alike and have all the\nsame phenomenal intentional states can nonetheless differ in their\nwide intentional states. So, it seems that wide intentional states are\nnot phenomenal intentional states. \n\nA Twin Earth case helps illustrate the options available in the case\nof wide intentional states (see Putnam 1975). Consider two\nindividuals, Alice and Twin Alice. Alice lives on Earth, while Twin\nAlice lives on a copy of Earth located far away from us in this world.\nLet us suppose that Alice and Twin Alice are phenomenal\nduplicates: they instantiate all the same phenomenal properties throughout their existences.\n\nAlice and Twin Alice each have a brother called \u201cBob\u201d. When\nAlice thinks a thought that she would express by making the sounds\n\u201cBob is happy\u201d, it seems that her thought is true at just\nthe worlds where Bob is happy. By contrast, it seems that the thought\nthat Twin Alice expresses with \u201cBob is happy\u201d in her\nidiolect is one that is true at just the worlds where Twin\nBob is happy. So it looks like the Alices\u2019 thoughts have\ndifferent truth conditions. This suggests that the Alices\u2019\nthoughts have different contents. Alice\u2019s thought represents\nthat Bob is happy, while Twin Alice\u2019s thought represents that\nTwin Bob is happy. The Alices\u2019 \u201cBob\u201d-thoughts are\nparadigmatic examples of putatively broad intentional states. \n\nFew advocates of PIT seem to endorse an inflationist strategy for\nbroad intentional states. Even advocates of PIT who take consciousness\nto be relational seem to agree that what a subject gets\nrelated to in consciousness depends solely on her intrinsic properties\n(Pautz 2010). However, Campbell (2002) holds that perceptual\nexperience is broad and intentional, and his view might be counted as\na type of phenomenal intentionality theory. \n\nSiewert (1998), Kriegel (2007), and Farkas (2008a) adopt an\neliminativist strategy with respect to broad intentional states. Their\nviews are the same in broad outline. On their views, the two\nAlices\u2019 thoughts have the same content, and that content is\nnarrow. We can account for the fact that the two Alices\u2019\nthoughts are made true by different Bobs by adding contextual\nparameters to their shared content: their shared content is not a\nfunction from possible worlds to truth values but a function from\npossible worlds and relevant elements of context to truth values. The\nintroduction of contexts enables us to account for the fact that the\nAlices\u2019 thoughts are true at different worlds. For example, one\n(over-simplistic) view along these lines could state that the shared\ncontent of the two Alices\u2019 thoughts can be modeled as a function\nfrom worlds W and contexts of use C that returns true\njust in case the person that bears the name \u201cBob\u201d in\nC is happy in W. Given that different contexts are\nrelevant to Alice and Twin Alice, different worlds can satisfy the\ncommon thought they express as \u201cBob is happy\u201d. If this is\nthe right way to think about content, the Bobs\u2019 case and other\ncases motivating broad content do not force us to recognize broad\ncontents. \n\nPitt (1999, 2011) also endorses an eliminativist strategy, arguing\nagainst externalist intuitions. Mendelovici (2010, 2018) also endorses\neliminativism but claims that she can capture many externalist\nintuitions through the notion of derived mental representation (see\nthe previous section). \n\nDerivativist strategies have also been applied to broad\ncontents (Loar 2003a,b, Horgan and Tienson 2002, Horgan, Tienson &\nGraham 2004, Bourget 2010, Chalmers 2010). The idea here is that broad\nintentional states have two contents: a phenomenally constituted\nnarrow content, and a broad content that is determined by the narrow\ncontent together with relevant factors in the environment. So\nAlice\u2019s thought has two contents: one narrow and one broad. The\nbroad content of her thought is true at just the worlds where Bob is\nhappy. The narrow content is true at the worlds where a person bearing\ncertain Bob-like characteristics is happy. The relevant Bob-like\ncharacteristics might, for example, centrally involve being called\n\u201cBob\u201d by people of a certain community. \n\nOf course, such a derivativist approach is compatible with other accounts of the narrow content of Alice\u2019s\nthought. The options available to proponents of PIT are the\nsame as for theories of narrow content in general. For instance, this\nderivativist approach can draw on all the resources of\ntwo-dimensional theories of narrow content (see Chalmers 2002a and the\nentries on\n two-dimensional semantics\n and\n narrow mental content).\n \n\nPautz (2008, 2013, 2017) offers a related derivativist approach that he dubs\nconsciousness-based best systems theory. On this view, facts about (sensory)\nphenomenal states and their internal causal roles fix the facts about\nwhat is rational for an agent to believe. These facts about\nrationality in turn fix the narrow contents of an individual\u2019s\nbeliefs. Wide contents are fixed by causal relations between beliefs\nand the environment.\n",
