    "main_text": "The Horak Debate\n5. The Horak Debate\n\nThe \u201cHo-rak\u201d debate, literally refers to the general\n\u201cProvincial-Capital\u201d divide among the different\nsub-factions of the \u201cNoron\u201d (Old Doctrine) Faction, which\nhad been initiated by scholars who had followed the metaphysical\nstance of Yulgok for the most part. As Kang (2003 [2006: 300]) points\nout,\n\n\nThe problem was that differences in academic opinions were associated\nwith antagonism between factions or regions.\n\n\nTherefore, scholars aligned themselves with either T\u2019oegye or\nYulgok\u2019s interpretations depending on their factional\naffiliation, and if one disagreed with the faction in power it could\nhave serious consequences (think Republicans/Democrats in the U.S.).\nIn this instance, like the Four-Seven Debate, it relates to a series\nof arguments raised in correspondence between two primary scholars of\nthis time, who were tightly aligned with different factions: Han\nW\u014fn-jin (1682\u20131751) from Ch\u2019ungch\u2019\u014fng\nprovince and Yi Kan (1677\u20131727) from Ky\u014fnggi province where\nSeoul is located. Seoh (1977:47) notes that both scholars are\n\n\nparticularly important because it was their debate over the definition\nof nature that precipitated a resurgence of the ki\nschool.\n\n\nThough Yi Kan underscored the central role of Principle, Han\nposited the operation of the human mind as dependent on\nki\u2014both original ki, and corrupted\nki. These ideas were related, not only to the emotions and\nhow they affect the actualised mind (thoughts/actions), but led to\nother speculative questions:\n\nHow should one describe the unaroused mind (mibal), in\nterms of ki or Principle, or a mixture?\nWhether sages and ordinary people have the same nature?, and\nIs the nature of human beings and nonhuman animals identical?\n(Richard Kim 2017: 90; Choi Y. 2011)\n\n\nRichard Kim (2017: 90) notes that such questions became the\ndebates\u2019 \u201cfoundational issue\u201d, thought it also\nbrought up some of issues related to the previous debate, in regard to\nthe effects of the emotions on the mind, and whether minds of sages\nand normal people were originally the same.\n\nThe notion of the unaroused mind appears in the Doctrine of the\nMean, one of the Four Books:\n\n\nBefore the feelings of pleasure, anger, sorrow and joy are aroused it\nis called equilibrium (chung [\u4e2d], centrality, mean).\nWhen these feelings are aroused and each and all attain due measure\nand degree, it is called harmony. (SB-Chan: 98)\n\n\nChoi Young-jin (2011: 9) describes this as \u201ca state of\nmoderation [\u2026] bent neither one way or another [\u2026] the\nstate of balance\u201d. This actual state of mind had never been\nanalysed in such minute detail before, nor had it been considered in\nsuch detail in relation to the sage, normal humans, and other animals:\nwere they the same, or not, at the microcosmic level of their mind in\nterms of ki or Principle? Han W\u014fn-jin\u2019s\nessay on the \u201cExplanation of the Original Nature and the\nPsycho-Physical Nature\u201d, sowed the seeds of the debate. In this\nessay he suggested that the original nature, even before being aroused\nin the mind (mibal, as argued by T\u2019oegye), was already\ninteracting with ki, in other words, energised by material\nforce, or as Richard Kim (2017: 92) puts it, Han viewed\n\u201cgi [ki] as constitutive of the inactivated\nmind\u201d. For Han, Principle required ki, so\nki already had to exist in the mind and this ki had\nto be originally good or in equilibrium, balanced and unmotivated by\ndesires. Clearly Han was \u201cadhering more strictly to the\nmaterialist core of the ki school\u201d, while claiming that\n\u201cnature is not an abstract [undifferentiated] entity\u201d, and\nthat Principle \u201cis nothing but a law of the dynamics of\nki,\u201d in other words, Principle had no concrete\nexistence of any sort (Seoh 1977: 48). He ultimately saw the nature of\na human and other animals as different even in their unaroused or\nmibal state where ki was inactive, and used their\ndifferent psycho-physical make-up (due to the variant manifestations\nof material force when activated) as the basis for his thesis. Han\nultimately considered the sage to possess a pure form of ki,\nalready balanced and pure even in an unaroused state, unlike other\nbeings (which for him also included women and children) and in this\nsense he is more hierarchically inclined in his approach, with a more\nidealistic vision of the sage\u2014something usually linked with\nproponents of Principle.\n\nYi Kan advocated the primacy of Principle in all living\nthings, and therefore the immanence of goodness embedded within the\nConfucian virtues. The idea of the immanence of Principle in\nall things is also addressed in a more macrocosmic sense in Zhang\nZai\u2019s Diagram of the Western Inscription, which appears\nin T\u2019oegye\u2019s Diagrams, though here again, in the Korean\ncontext these ideas are analysed in a more microcosmic manner. Yi\nasserted that human and nonhuman animals had the potential to manifest\nthe universal \u201coriginal mind\u201d (\u672c\u5fc3, K.\nbonsim). This, according to Yi, was not always manifest by\nhumans because their \u201cphysical nature\u201d and, thereby, their\npsycho-physical preponderances varied: some humans were good, but some\nacted badly, just as was the case for nonhuman animals. He rather\nsuggested that the apparent differences, were actually nothing other\nthan differences in temperaments due to the turbidity of ki\nafter feelings were aroused, but that the underlying\nPrinciple meant that they were morally unified in an\nunaroused state (R. Kim 2017). This also meant that theoretically,\nwomen too, even children, could aspire to be sages because their\n\u201coriginal mind\u201d, which was \u201cthe foundation of for\nhuman morality\u201d was no different from that of a sage, what\nmattered was that one controlled one\u2019s desires because\n\u201csages are those who maintain their moral self\u201d: those who\ndevelop themselves to the optimum level of humanity (Lee\n2011: 108). As Lee (2011: 111) asserts, Yi\n\n\nwent so far as to say that the original mind-heart [sim] is\nclearly present in anyone at any time, and the mind-hearts of sages\nand commoners are alike when aroused.\n\n\nFor Yi, what made one a sage was the fact that they\n\u201cacted\u201d morally\u2014being aware of what is good but not\nacting on it at all times was what made one a \u201ccommon\u201d\nperson.\n\nSeoh (1977: 43) summarises the debate as follows:\n\n\nYi Kan equated the nature of man with other creatures and stressed its\nuniversality, while Han maintained the uniqueness of the nature of man\nin contrast with other creatures.\n\n\nOne interesting contribution in regard to this debate, came from one\nof the few women of the Chos\u014fn period to write on\nNeo-Confucianism (hence trained in Classical Chinese), Im Yunjidang\n(1721\u20131793). She disagreed with Yulgok\u2019s interpretation of\nki, whom her own brothers had agreed with, and instead\nclaimed \u201cthat each thing [or species] in the universe possesses\na particularised and embodied nature\u201d, while ultimately\nconvinced of the role of \u201cHeaven endowed\u201d\nPrinciple (Kim Sungmoon 2017: 190\u2013191). Im also wrote\nabout the moral equality of both sexes, something highlighted by the\nearly Catholics in Korea. Kang Ch\u014fngiltang (1772\u20131832),\nanother female Confucian scholar from this period, emphasised that\nhuman nature is good, as well as the importance of putting Confucian\nideals into practice. Her short poem on \u201cConcentrating on\nMindfulness\u201d [or reverence] manages to capture with exquisite\nconciseness the main themes and the ultimate goal of Neo-Confucian\nlearning in Chos\u014fn, namely, sagehood (Kim Youngmin 2007: 226,\nslightly altered translation):\n\n\nMyriad Patterns [principles] originate from Heaven-and-Earth.\n\nOne mind unites nature and emotions.\n\nWithout concentrating on mindfulness,\n\nHow can you manage the long trip to sagehood?\n\n\nInterestingly, by this stage it is important to note that Catholicism,\nconsidered as part of \u201cWestern Learning\u201d\n(\u897f\u5b78, K. S\u014fhak), had already attracted the\ninterest of some Neo-Confucian scholars, directing them away from an\nunemotional Principle, towards a belief in an anthropomorphic\ncaring deity.\n",
