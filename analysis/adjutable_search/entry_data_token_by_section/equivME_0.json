    "main_text": "The Physics of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n1. The Physics of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n\nA lot of philosophical attention has been paid to how the meaning of\nstatements concerning lengths and times changes in the context of\nspecial relativity. For example, we have learned from Stein (1968)\nthat a statement such as \u201cthe length of the table is 2m,\u201d\nwhile perfectly meaningful in the context of Newtonian physics, is\neither elliptical at best or meaningless at worst in the context of\nspecial relativity. However, comparatively little philosophical\nattention has been paid to how special relativity brings about\ncorresponding changes to the third fundamental dimension in basic\nphysics: mass. Yet, assertions concerning mass, and other dynamical\nconcepts in mechanics into which it figures centrally, notably\nmomentum and kinetic energy, also have their meanings changed in\nspecial relativity. \n\nTo illustrate these changes, Section 1.1 reviews the concepts of mass,\nmomentum and kinetic energy in Newtonian physics. In Section 1.2, we\nbegin exploring the concepts of mass and energy in special relativity\nand state the notation we use in all further discussions, a step we\nmust make explicit as discussions of the equivalence of mass and\nenergy have historically used different notations, which can lead to\nconceptual confusion. In Section 1.3, we discuss the physical\nsignificance of mass-energy equivalence as it applies to the analysis\nof bodies (construed as indivisible wholes) and idealized versions of\ncomposite systems, while in Section 1.4 we discuss mass and energy in\natomic physics. In Section 1.5, we present an elementary derivation of\nEinstein\u2019s famous result with the hope that our readers will get\na sense of \u201cwhy\u201d mass and energy are equivalent according\nto special relativity. Finally, in Section 1.6, we consider the\nrelationship between the equivalence of mass and energy codified in\nthe equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\) and the nearly identical, though\nconceptually quite different, ubiquitous equation \\(E = mc^2\\). \n",
