    "main_text": "Further aspects of medieval probability || The dialectical syllogism\n4.1 The dialectical syllogism\n\nSyllogisms are patterns of logical argumentation. A syllogism with\nmerely probable premises was called dialectical in medieval and\nRenaissance philosophy. Since dialectic was the \u201cart of rational\ndisputation\u201d or \u201ccontroversial inquiry\u201d (ars\ndisserendi), and disputation was a characteristic activity of\nuniversities in the Middle Ages, argumentation with probable\npropositions possessed an enormous significance for medieval thought.\nIt is also characteristic of logic-fed scholasticism that probable\nreasoning was mainly conceived as logical deduction from probable\n premises.[31]\n After the rise of Aristotelianism, these premises were mostly framed\nas endoxa. Thomas Aquinas writes:\n\n\nThe dialectician is concerned only with proceeding from propositions\nwhich are as acceptable as possible. These are propositions which seem\ntrue to most people and especially to the wise. (Thomas Aquinas,\nPosterior Analytics, I, 31, 3, 142)\n\n\nIt is not, however, clear whether authors who summarily refer to\nprobable premises only intend endoxa in their definitions of\ndialectical syllogism, or whether they operate, like Albert of\nCologne, with a broader notion of probable premise. Albert\n(Logica, I, 4, 2, 278) speaks with respect to the dialectical\nsyllogism about premises which are always or most often (in\npluribus) true. There was also some discussion about the\nepistemic status of the argumentative scheme of the dialectical\nsyllogism and the conclusions from probable premises. The common\nassumption was that the dialectic syllogism is an indubitably valid\ndeductive scheme, but that probable premises produce only probable\nconclusions or opinions (Buridan, Quaestiones, 19; Buridan,\nSummulae, 347).\n\nOckham offers some remarkable comments in Summa logicae\nIII.1.1 concerning probability in the dialectical\n syllogism.[32]\n Like many others, Ockham assumes that the dialectical syllogism\nstarts from merely probable propositions (probabilia), which\nhe characterizes as endoxa. Yet he then claims that probable\npropositions are true and necessary, even though they are not per se\nor derivatively known to be true with certainty (probabilia sunt\nilla, quae cum sint vera et necesseria, non tamen per se nota, nec ex\nper se notis syllogizabilia, nec etiam per experientiam evidenter\nnota, nec ex talibus sequentia). Probability, thus, hinges on an\nepistemically deficient state of an observer. However, a dialectical\nsyllogism need not produce uncertainty in an observer since it need\nnot produce fear of error but can instead engender firm conviction in\nits\n conclusion.[33]\n Ockham deviates here from some familiar scholastic assumptions\nconcerning probability. His probabilia cannot be probable\nopinions in the third sense of Grosseteste (see above), which are by\ndefinition contingent. The conclusion of a dialectical syllogism is\nalso not necessarily a probable opinion because then it would be\naccompanied by fear of error. This cluster of sentences is\nnevertheless all Ockham has to say about probability in the Summa\nlogicae (and Burley, Buridan, and others say even less in their\nlogical works). No deeper analysis concerning the role of\nprobabilia in his philosophy or theology ensues, and his\nuncommon remarks apparently did not spark any discussion by\n others.[34]\n Elsewhere in his work, Ockham judges specific philosophical theses to\nbe probable or more probable in the same way as other scholastic\nauthors did. If his short comments on probabilia in the\nSumma logicae offer a glimpse of the deeper modal and\nontological ramifications of probability, they also document that\nthese ramifications were hardly pursued by medieval\n scholastics.[35]\n\nHowever important dialectical syllogisms may have been for medieval\ndisputation, it should also be recognized that action-planning in\nconscience was conceived as deduction from (partly) probable premises.\nThe dialectical syllogism therefore provided a logical basis for moral\ndecisions and served as a tool for moral theology.\n\nThe humanist dialectic of the Renaissance shared many assumptions\nconcerning the dialectical syllogism with the scholastics, but some\nauthors developed a different understanding of dialectic. These\ndevelopments will be discussed in Section 5.\n",
