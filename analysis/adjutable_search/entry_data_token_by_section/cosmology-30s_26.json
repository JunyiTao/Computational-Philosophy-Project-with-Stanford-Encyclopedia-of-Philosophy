    "main_text": "The Calm Between the Storms || The Origin and Evolution of Theories\n7.2 The Origin and Evolution of Theories\n\nMcCrea\u2019s overall view is that theories are set up to be\nhypothetico-deductive in structure. His account is based on his view\nof the evolution of theories of space-time and mechanics, beginning\nwith Newton, through the General Theory of Relativity and ending in\nkinematic relativity. His argument reduces to the claim that, insofar\nas Milne and e.g., Newton, can be shown to follow the same procedure,\nany attack upon Milne is also an attack upon Newton. First, he states\nhis goals in the paper.\n\nThe first goal is to emphasise how each theory leaves us in a position\nin which the succeeding one appears as a perfectly natural next step\nin the development of ideas (McCrea 1939, p. 137). McCrea embeds this\nargument in an account of how analogue models (\u00e0 la Campbell)\nare used to set up new theories\u2014this is essentially an account\nof how discovery might proceed in linking an older theory with its\nsuccessor. The second goal is to show how, in spite of superficial\ndifferences in character, the theories in question all necessarily\npossess the same general structure constituted by the presence of\nhypotheses, from which certain general mathematical relations are\ndeduced, which in their turn are used to predict relations between\nobservable quantities. As McCrea notes, \u201cthis study may claim an\ninterest of its own, but it is presented also for a further\nreason\u201d namely, that\n\nit has been contended [by Dingle, most especially] that theories like\nMilne\u2019s represent a fundamentally new outlook on the part of\nsome theorists, in that such theories are purely mental constructs\ndivorced from experience of the physical world. We shall see that on\nthe contrary Milne\u2019s theory is easily brought into line with the\nothers in such a way that this criticism is neither more nor less true\nof it than of the rest. (McCrea 1939, p. 138)\n\n\nIn McCrea\u2019s discussion of the theories he asserts that\n\u201cthe consituents [of the theories themselves] which are of\nphysical significance are sets of mathematical relations, coupled with\nsets of rules of interpretation\u201d which yield, \u201cafter\nobservational test, descriptions rather than explanations of physical\nphenomena.\u201d According to McCrea, one real advantage of his view\nis that it \u201cleads to simple criteria for comparing the merits of\ndifferent theories.\u201d Finally, on the metaphysics of the original\nhypotheses, McCrea claims that \u201cthe initial hypotheses from\nwhich the mathematical relations are deduced do not ultimately have\nany direct physical significance.\u201d\n\nMcCrea\u2019s paper, published in the leading philosophy of science\njournal of the time, is the final imprimateur on Milne\u2019s\nviews.\n",
