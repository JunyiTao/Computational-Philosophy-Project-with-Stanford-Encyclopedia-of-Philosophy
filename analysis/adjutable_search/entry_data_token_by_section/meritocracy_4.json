    "main_text": "Meritocratic Governance\n3. Meritocratic Governance\n\nThis section and the following one are the core of this entry. They\naddress the two principal senses in which meritocracy has arisen\nwithin\n philosophy.[1]\n This section considers meritocracy as a form of government.\n\nTerminologically, these systems are referred to as \u201cpolitical\nmeritocracies\u201d in the Eastern philosophical literature and\n\u201cepistocracies\u201d in the Western literature. The latter term\nis due to David Estlund (2003) and stresses the superior\nknowledge\u2014episteme\u2014which meritocratic political\nrulers possess. This entry follows the former usage.\n\nThree broad questions face proposals for meritocratic governance. The\nfirst asks what constitutes merit or, equivalently, \u201cwho are the\nmeritocrats?\u201d The meritocratic class could consist of citizens\nwho are competent (somehow defined); who are more likely than\nothers to produce good political results (which could be different\nfrom the class of competent\n citizens\u2014\u00a72.1);\n who are best able to represent their constituents; or\nsomething else.\n\nThe second question asks, \u201chow should the meritocrats\nrule?\u201d It is not enough to show that there is a well-defined\nmeritocratic class. A particular form of government, harnessing the\nmeritocrats, must be elaborated.\n\nThe third question asks, \u201cis meritocracy justifiable?\u201d\nThat is, proponents of meritocracy must defend their system against\nthe charge that it is unfair. Discussion of these challenges is\ndelayed until\n \u00a75.\n\nWith one deontological exception (to be discussed), meritocratic\npolitical systems are justified on consequentialist grounds.\nMeritocrats claim, that is, that their systems would produce better\npolitical outcomes\u2014more justice and prosperity, say\u2014than\nprevailing political systems do.\n\nMany contemporary meritocrats are motivated by a perception that\ncontemporary democracy is dysfunctional. They adduce a range of\nempirical research: voters don\u2019t know basic political facts\n(e.g., Somin 2013); they treat politics as a sport, in which what is\nimportant is not achieving good social outcomes or even promoting\ntheir own interests but that their \u201cteam\u201d win (Lenz 2012);\nthey are afflicted by motivated reasoning, seeking out\nevidence to confirm existing beliefs and generating specious grounds\nto ignore disconfirming evidence (Flynn, Nyhan, & Reifler 2017);\nand more. (The relevant research was pioneered by Converse [1964].\nBrennan [2016] provides a contemporary survey.)\n",
