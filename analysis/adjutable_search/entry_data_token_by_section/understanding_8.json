    "main_text": "Special Issues in Epistemology || Testimony\n3.2 Testimony\n\nA key issue in social epistemology is whether understanding, like\nordinary propositional knowledge, can be transmitted via\ntestimony. Thus it seems that I can transmit my knowledge to you that\nthe next train is arriving at 4:15, just by telling you. Transmitting\nunderstanding, however, does not seem to work so easily, if it is\npossible at all. According to Myles Burnyeat,\n\n\nUnderstanding is not transmissible in the same sense as knowledge is.\nIt is not the case that in normal contexts of communication the\nexpression of understanding imparts understanding to one\u2019s\nhearer as the expression of knowledge can and often does impact\nunderstanding. (Burnyeat 1980: 186)\n\n\nThus a teacher might try to convey her understanding of some subject\nmatter\u2014say, of how Type II Diabetes works\u2014but there is no\nguarantee that the understanding will in fact be transmitted,\nor that her students will come to see or grasp what she herself sees\nand grasps.\n\nSupposing that understanding cannot be transmitted by testimony, there\nare a few explanations for why this might be the case. For one,\nZagzebski argues that the kind of \u201cseeing\u201d or\n\u201cgrasping\u201d that seems integral to understanding is\nsomething a person can only do \u201cfirst hand\u201d\u2014it\ncannot be inherited from anyone else (Zagzebski 2008: ch. 6). For\nanother, and according to Hills, if we agree that understanding is a\nskill or ability, then understanding will be difficult or impossible\nto transmit because skills and abilities in general are difficult or\nimpossible to transmit (Hills 2009, 2020). It is therefore a specific\ncase of a more general phenomena.\n\nOthers have argued that understanding is not, in fact, so difficult to\ntransmit. Suppose I ask why you are late for our meeting, and you tell\nme \u201ctraffic\u201d. It then seems like you have transmitted your\nunderstanding to me quite directly\u2014apparently just as directly\nas when you communicate your knowledge to me that the next train is\ncoming at 4:15 (Grimm 2020). What seems required for successful\ntransmission of understanding is thus that the right conceptual\nscaffolding is in place, on the part of the recipient. But supposing\nthe scaffolding is in place, understanding can plausibly be\ntransmitted in much the way knowledge can (Boyd 2017; cf. Malfatti\n2019, 2020). Others argue that since something like propositional\nknowledge of causes entails at least a low degree of understanding, a\nlow degree of understanding can be transmitted via testimony in the\nsame way as knowledge can (Hu 2019).\n\nIt has also been pointed out that even if we agree that seeing or\ngrasping needs to be first-hand, and that others cannot do this for\nme, the same \u201cfirst-handedness\u201d apparently holds for\nbelief. That is, no one else can believe for me, because\nbelieving is a first-personal act (Hazlett forthcoming: sec. 2.3). But\njust as this fact about belief does not lead us to think that\npropositional knowledge cannot be transmitted, so too it should not\nlead us to think that understanding cannot be transmitted (Boyd\n2017).\n\nIn relation to moral testimony in particular, understanding has been\ninvoked to explain why it often seems odd or \u201cfishy\u201d to\ndefer to others about moral issues, such as whether eating meat is\nmorally wrong (for an overview, see Callahan 2020; cf. Riaz 2015). One\nexplanation of the fishiness is that the epistemic good we really want\nwith respect to moral questions is not mere knowledge but rather\nunderstanding. It is then said, for reasons tied to those just\nmentioned, that understanding cannot be easily (if at all) transmitted\nby testimony\u2014either because it is an ability, and abilities\ncannot easily be transmitted (Hills 2009, 2013, 2016) or because\ngenuine understanding in moral matters involves a suite of emotional\nand affective responses that cannot easily be transmitted by testimony\n(Callahan 2018). Deferring to moral testimony is therefore fishy, it\nis argued, because it does not get us the epistemic good we really\nwant\u2014moral understanding.\n\n",
