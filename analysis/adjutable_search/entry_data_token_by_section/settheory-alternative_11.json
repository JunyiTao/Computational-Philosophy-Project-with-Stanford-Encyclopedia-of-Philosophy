    "main_text": "Theories with Classes || Class theory over ZFC\n5.1 Class theory over ZFC\n\nEven those mathematicians who accepted the Zermelo-style set theories\nas the standard (most of them!) often found themselves wanting to talk\nabout \u201call sets\u201d, or \u201call ordinals\u201d, or\nsimilar concepts.\n\nVon Neumann (who actually formulated a theory of functions, not sets),\nG\u00f6del, and Bernays developed closely related systems which admit,\nin addition to the sets found in ZFC, general collections of\nthese sets. (In Hallett 1984, it is argued that the system of von\nNeumann was the first system in which the Axiom of Replacement was\nimplemented correctly [there were technical problems with\nFraenkel\u2019s formulation], so it may actually be the first\nimplementation of ZFC.)\n\nWe present a theory of this kind. Its objects are classes.\nAmong the classes we identify those which are elements as sets.\n\n\nAxiom of extensionality: Classes with the same\nelements are the same.\n\nDefinition: A class \\(x\\) is a set just in\ncase there is a class \\(y\\) such that \\(x \\in y\\). A class which is\nnot a set is said to be a proper class.\n\nAxiom of class comprehension: For any formula\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) which involves quantification only over all sets (not over\nall classes), there is a class \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) which contains\nexactly those sets \\(x\\) for which \\(\\phi(x)\\) is true.\n\n\nThe axiom scheme of class comprehension with quantification only over\nsets admits a finite axiomatization (a finite selection of formulas\n\\(\\phi\\) (most with parameters) suffices) and was historically first\npresented in this way. It is an immediate consequence of class\ncomprehension that the Russell class \\(\\{x \\mid x \\not\\in x\\}\\) cannot\nbe a set (so there is at least one proper class).\n\n\nAxiom of limitation of size: A class \\(C\\) is proper\nif and only if there is a class bijection between \\(C\\) and the\nuniverse.\n\n\nThis elegant axiom is essentially due to von Neumann. A class\nbijection is a class of ordered pairs; there might be pathology here\nif we did not have enough pairs as sets, but other axioms do provide\nfor their existence. It is interesting to observe that this axiom\nimplies Replacement (a class which is the same size as a set cannot be\nthe same size as the universe) and, surprisingly, implies Choice (the\nvon Neumann ordinals make up a proper class essentially by the\nBurali-Forti paradox, so the universe must be the same size as the\nclass of ordinals, and the class bijection between the universe and\nthe ordinals allows us to define a global well-ordering of the\nuniverse, whose existence immediately implies Choice).\n\nAlthough Class Comprehension and Limitation of Size appear to tell us\nexactly what classes there are and what sets there are, more axioms\nare required to make our universe large enough. These can be taken to\nbe the axioms of Z (other than extensionality and choice,\nwhich are not needed): the sethood of pairs of sets, unions of sets,\npower sets of sets, and the existence of an infinite set are enough to\ngive us the world of ZFC. Foundation is usually added. The\nresulting theory is a conservative extension of ZFC: it\nproves all the theorems of ZFC about sets, and it does not\nprove any theorem about sets which is not provable in ZFC.\nFor those with qualms about choice (or about global choice),\nLimitation of Size can be restricted to merely assert that the image\nof a set under a class function is a set.\n\nWe have two comments about this. First, the mental furniture of set\ntheorists does seem to include proper classes, though usually it is\nimportant to them that all talk of proper classes can be explained\naway (the proper classes are in some sense \u201cvirtual\u201d).\nSecond, this theory (especially the version with the strong axiom of\nLimitation of Size) seems to capture the intuition of Cantor about the\nAbsolute Infinite.\n\nA stronger theory with classes, but still essentially a version of\nstandard set theory, is the Kelley-Morse set theory in which Class\nComprehension is strengthened to allow quantification over all classes\nin the formulas defining classes. Kelley-Morse set theory is not\nfinitely axiomatizable, and it is stronger than ZFC in the\nsense that it allows a proof of the consistency of ZFC.\n",
