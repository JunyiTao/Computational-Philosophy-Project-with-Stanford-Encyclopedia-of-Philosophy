    "main_text": "Philosophy and the History of Philosophy\n4. Philosophy and the History of Philosophy\n\nGadamer\u2019s commitment to the historically conditioned character\nof understanding, coupled with the hermeneutic imperative that we\nengage with our historical situatedness, means that he takes\nphilosophy to itself stand in a critical relation to the history of\nphilosophy. Gadamer\u2019s own thought certainly reflects a\nhermeneutical commitment to both philosophical dialogue and historical\nengagement. His public debates with contemporary figures such as\nHabermas and Derrida, although they have not always lived up to\nGadamer\u2019s own ideals of hermeneutic dialogue (at least not in\nrespect of Derrida), have provided clear evidence of Gadamer\u2019s\nown commitment to such engagement. The dialogue with philosophy and\nits history also makes up a large part of Gadamer\u2019s published\nwork and, while that dialogue has encompassed a range of thinkers, its\nprimary focus has been on Plato, Aristotle, Hegel and Heidegger.\n\nIn the case of Plato and Aristotle (see Gadamer 1980, 1986a, 1991),\nGadamer has argued for a particular way of reading both thinkers that\nattends to the character of their texts, that takes those texts to\ndisplay a high degree of consistency, and that, particularly in the\nlater work, also views Plato and Aristotle as holding essentially\nsimilar views. In The Beginning of Philosophy (1997a),\nGadamer also takes Plato and Aristotle as providing the indispensable\npoint of entry to an understanding of Pre-Socratic thought. When it\ncomes to Hegel (see Gadamer 1971), although there is much that Gadamer\nfinds sympathetic to his own hermeneutic project (particularly\nHegel\u2019s attempt to move beyond the dichotomy of subject and\nobject, as well as aspects of Hegel\u2019s revival of ancient\ndialectic), Gadamer\u2019s commitment to a hermeneutics of finitude\n(and so to what Hegel terms \u2018bad infinity\u2019) places him in\ndirect opposition to the Hegelian philosophy of reflection that aims\nat totality and completion. It is with Heidegger, however, that\nGadamer had his most significant, sustained and yet also most\nproblematic philosophical engagement (see especially Gadamer 1994a).\nAlthough Gadamer emphasized the continuities between his own work and\nthat of Heidegger, and was clearly gratified by those occasions when\nHeidegger gave his approval to Gadamer\u2019s work, he can also be\nseen as involved in a subtle reworking of Heidegger\u2019s ideas. On\na number of points, that reworking has a rather different character\nfrom that which is explicit in Heidegger. In particular, Gadamer\nargues that Heidegger\u2019s attempts, in his later thinking, to find\na \u2018non-metaphysical\u2019 path of thought led Heidegger into a\nsituation in which he experienced a \u2018lack of (or need for)\nlanguage\u2019 (a Sprachnot). Gadamer\u2019s own work can\nthus be seen as an attempt to take up the path of Heidegger\u2019s\nlater thought in a way that does not abandon, but rather attempts to\nwork with our existing language. Similarly, while Heidegger views the\nhistory of philosophy as characterized by a \u2018forgetting\u2019\nof being\u2014a forgetting that is inaugurated by Plato\u2014Gadamer\ntakes the history of philosophy to have no such tendency. In this\nrespect, many of the differences between Gadamer and Heidegger become\nclearest in their differing readings of the philosophical tradition,\nas well as in their approaches to poets such as H\u00f6lderlin.\n",
