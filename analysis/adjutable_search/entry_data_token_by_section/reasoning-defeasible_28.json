    "main_text": "Causation and Defeasible Reasoning || The Need for Explicit Causal Information\n6.1 The Need for Explicit Causal Information\n\nHanks and McDermott, computer scientists at Yale, demonstrated that\nthe existing systems of nonmonotonic logic were unable to give the\nright solution to a simple problem about predicting the course of\nevents (Hanks and McDermott 1987). The problem became known as the\nYale shooting problem. Hanks and McDermott assume that some sort\nof law of inertia can be assumed: that normally properties of\nthings do not change. In the Yale shooting problem, there are two\nrelevant properties: being loaded (a property of a gun) and being\nalive (a property of the intended victim of the shooting). Let\u2019s\nassume that in the initial situation, \\(s_0\\), the gun\nis loaded and the victim is alive,\nLoaded\\((s_0)\\) and\nAlive\\((s_0)\\), and that two actions are\nperformed in sequence: Wait and Shoot. Let\u2019s\ncall the situation that results from a moment of waiting\n\\(s_1\\), and the situation that follows both waiting\nand then shooting \\(s_2\\). There are then three\ninstances of the law of inertia that are relevant:\n\nAlive\\((s_0) \\Rightarrow\\)\nAlive\\((s_1)\\)\nLoaded\\((s_0) \\Rightarrow\\)\nLoaded\\((s_1)\\)\nAlive\\((s_1) \\Rightarrow\\)\nAlive\\((s_2)\\)\n\n\nWe need to make one final assumption: that shooting the victim with a\nloaded gun results in death (not being alive):\n\n((Alive\\((s_1)\\) &\nLoaded\\((s_1)) \\rightarrow \\neg\\)Alive\\((s_2)\\)\n\n\nIntuitively, we should be able to derive the defeasible conclusion\nthat the victim is still alive after waiting, but dead after waiting\nand shooting: Alive\\((s_1) \\amp\n\\neg\\)Alive\\((s_2)\\). However, none of the nonmonotonic\nlogics described above give us this result, since each of the three\ninstances of the law of inertia can be violated: by the victim\u2019s\ninexplicably dying while we are waiting, by the gun\u2019s\nmiraculously becoming unloaded while we are waiting, or by the\nvictim\u2019s dying as a result of the shooting. Nothing introduced\ninto nonmonotonic logic up to this point provides us with a basis for\npreferring the second exception to the law of inertia to the first or\nthird. What\u2019s missing is a recognition of the importance of\ncausal structure to defeasible\nconsequence.[10]\n\nThere are several even simpler examples that illustrate the need to\ninclude explicitly causal information in the input to defeasible\nreasoning. Consider, for instance, this problem of Judea Pearl\u2019s\n(Pearl 1988): if the sprinkler is on, then normally the sidewalk is\nwet, and, if the sidewalk is wet, then normally it is raining.\nHowever, we should not infer that it is raining from the fact that the\nsprinkler is on. (See Lifschitz 1990 and Lin and Reiter 1994 for\nadditional examples of this kind.) Similarly, if we also know that if\nthe sidewalk is wet, then it is slippery, we should be able to infer\nthat the sidewalk is slippery if the sprinkler is on and it is\nnot raining.\n\nThe distinction between causal and evidential rules has been used in\nthe argumentative-narrative model of reasoning with evidence developed\nby Floris Bex and his colleagues (Bex et al. 2010; Bex 2011).\n",
