    "main_text": "Contemporary Philosophical Approaches to Tort Law || Assessing Civil Recourse Theory\n4.5 Assessing Civil Recourse Theory\n\nOne prominent objection to civil recourse theory, made both by\ndefenders of corrective justice accounts and defenders of economic\nanalysis, is that the principle of civil recourse is true but trivial.\nThe founders of the economic analysis of tort law, Richard Posner and\nGuido Calabresi, both of whom were at the time federal appellate\njudges in the United States, have argued that the principle of civil\nrecourse is empty, and could provide no possible guidance to any judge\nattempting to decide a case. Instead, other factors, including\ninstrumental ones, must be introduced in order to explain the\nresolution of the case and the measure of damages; that it all takes\nplace before a court at the initiative of the plaintiff is\ninstitutionally true but analytically insignificant for Posner (2013)\nand Calabresi (2013). More generally, the entitlement of someone to\nclaim a remedy from the person who has wronged them is a generic\nfeature of private legal relationships, and so fails to shed any\ndistinctive light on tort law. Instead, just as contract law provides\nplaintiffs with remedies because they have been wronged, however\nimperfectly those remedies might repair those wrongs, so too does the\nlaw of tort. That legal structure does not, however, lead to the\nconclusion that contract remedies have some point other than to\nenforce the contractual right that was violated, however imperfect\nthat remedy may be as a substitute. So, too, in the case of tort law,\nany obligation that the state has to provide a forum and avenue of\nrecourse does not show that the principle of recourse is anything\nother than the enforcement of the right that was violated. The claim\nthat there is no legal duty to pay damages unless the plaintiff brings\nsuit has also been disputed (Steel & Stevens 2020).\n\nA second objection to civil recourse theory charges that it is nothing\nmore than a notational variant on corrective justice theory, sharing\nits focus on wrongdoing, as well as its accounts of the objective\nstandard in negligence and its explanation of the lack of recovery for\npure economic loss (Benson 1995; Zipursky 2003). One of the\ndifficulties in assessing this objection is that, as we saw above,\nthere are different formulations of corrective justice theory.\nDiscussions of corrective justice in the civil recourse literature\noften associate it with the idea that the plaintiff must be made\nwhole, that is, with a purely compensatory idea, which some civil\nrecourse writers describe as moving from a less just state of affairs\nto a more just one. The idea that tort liability always leads to a net\nimprovement in justice is difficult to fit to the world in which tort\nlaw actually operates (Goldberg & Zipursky 2020). Yet prominent\nwriters about corrective justice, including Weinrib and Ripstein, do\nnot claim that the point of corrective justice is to increase justice\nglobally; instead, they characterize remedies in terms of the specific\ntransaction. Aristotle explicitly rejects the suggestion the point of\ncorrective justice is to produce greater justice along any further\ndimension when he states that duties of corrective justice apply even\nin cases in which a \u201cdecent\u201d person is required pay\ndamages to a \u201cbase\u201d one (Nicomachean Ethics, Book\nV, Ch. 4). For Aristotle, the basis of liability is the past\ntransaction between them, rather than the comparative magnitude of\ntheir holdings along any other dimension. Since civil recourse theory\nalso begins with a focus on the wrongful transaction, corrective\njustice writers suggest that it adds nothing to corrective justice\nanalysis and does not contrast with it.\n\nCivil recourse theory does, however, differ in at least one important\nway from corrective justice theory. It contends that the purpose of a\ntort remedy is not to enforce the plaintiff\u2019s right against the\ndefendant, but to permit the plaintiff to exercise a power to proceed\nagainst the defendant; the state owes a duty to the plaintiff to\nprovide a forum in which that power can be exercised. For corrective\njustice theory, the remedy enforces the right that was violated; for\ncivil recourse theory, the remedy addresses the fact that some right\nwas violated, rather than enforcing the specific right that was\nviolated. On this view, damages seeking to repair the specific rights\nviolated and the magnitude of the loss are only one form of recourse.\nThe disparate remedies provided by tort law are unified by the fact\nthat they are forms of recourse rather than by their aim of repairing\nrights violations.\n\nThis focus on the plaintiff\u2019s right against the state\ndistinguishes civil recourse theory from corrective justice but raises\na further puzzle about the status of that right. As a doctrinal and\ninterpretive matter, private rights of action in tort have been\nabolished in particular cases, as most prominently New Zealand has\ndone for all personal injuries but, more pervasively, as virtually\nevery common law country has done for a broad range of workplace\naccidents that take place in the course of employment. This raises two\npossibilities, each of which faces difficulties. One possibility is\nthat abolishing the private cause of action abolishes the\nvictim\u2019s right against the state to be empowered to seek\nredress, in which case the principle that there is no right without a\nremedy is dramatically narrowed in scope. Rather than seeing a right\nto recourse as something the state must grant because self-help has\nbeen abolished, on this first alternative, the right of recourse\nappears to apply only to cases in which the state has granted both the\nright and the cause of action, since the state can abolish both\nself-help and the cause of action. While this first alternative\ndescribes a familiar structure of positive law, it detaches civil\nrecourse theory from its roots in Lockean political philosophy and so\ndeprives it of its broader explanatory ambitions. Alternatively,\nprohibiting self-help in cases of automobile accidents or workplace\naccidents while also failing to provide a private right of action\ncould be characterized as a violation of the rights of those who have\nbeen denied both self-help and recourse, in which case the theory\nwould require that the state must provide a remedy for that violation.\nSuch an account fails to fit familiar features of legal doctrine,\nwhich does not require states limiting the rights of action to provide\nan alternative remedy to those who would otherwise be able to exercise\nthem. Other critics have criticized the ways in which civil recourse\ntheory characterizes legal powers (Herstein 2015), or suggested that\nit only applies in circumstances in which corrective justice cannot be\nrealized (Stone 2022).\n\nSome critics of civil recourse theory have charged it with focusing on\nrevenge in a way that is morally suspect and at odds with the ideas of\nlegality. Some defenders have suggested that a focus on revenge\nprovides a more satisfying interpretation of tort law (Oman 2011;\nHershovitz 2014; Gold 2020). On this interpretation, the Lockean idea\nof a social contract is framed in terms of a default moral position in\nwhich self-help motivated by resentment or outrage is the appropriate\nresponse to having been wronged. For understandable reasons, states do\nnot permit self-help, particularly self-help carried out in anger, and\nso must provide a substitute for the conduct they have prohibited. On\nthis understanding, civil recourse is plainly distinct from corrective\njustice, because the point of the remedy is not merely to grant power\nto the plaintiff but to enable the plaintiff to act out of anger in a\ncontrolled setting. Such an interpretation faces both analytical and\nnormative challenges. The analytical challenge is in explaining how\nthe entire account does not presuppose a prior and more fundamental\nprinciple of corrective justice: if recourse is a substitute for\nlegitimate revenge, the most obvious interpretation of the imagined\nsocial contract would represent the right of recourse as the\ncompensation due to those who have been improperly deprived of a\nnatural right to exact revenge. The normative difficulty comes from\nthe assumption that there is a right to take revenge, so that the\nstate owes compensation for depriving people of it. However pervasive\nthe desire for revenge might be in human psychology, prohibiting it\ndoes not seem to be the kind of wrongful act that requires\ncompensation (Ripstein 2011; Steel 2021). A different interpretation\nof the revenge rationale understands the granting of a right of\nrecourse not as something that is owed as a matter of justice but\nrather as a political compromise in order to maintain peace by giving\ncertain moral emotions an output. As a piece of political sociology,\nthis account would need to explain how that outlet is properly\npreserved in a system in which most cases are settled, and why it is\nrequired in cases of injury for which the law provides a remedy even\nthough outrage would seem both inappropriate and idiosyncratic, such\nas mistaken but harmless trespasses to land and cases in which the\ndefendant\u2019s best efforts fell below the standard imposed by\nlaw.\n",
