    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in mathematics\n2. Mathematical explanation in mathematics\n\nMuch mathematical activity is driven by factors other than\nestablishing that a certain theorem is true. In many cases\nmathematicians are unsatisfied by merely knowing that a mathematical\nfact holds and reprove it, while also claiming explanatory benefits\nfor the new proof. This type of explanatory activity appears within\nmathematics itself (see the Preamble) and thus one often speaks of\n\u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cintra-mathematical\nexplanations\u201d (Baron, Colyvan & Ripley 2020, Betti 2010,\nMancosu 2008). The expression \u201cinternal mathematical\nexplanation\u201d covers a wide range of different phenomena: an\ninternal mathematical explanation could amount to the recasting of an\nentire area of mathematics or it might aim at providing explanatory\nproofs for specific theorems. The variety of these mathematical\nexplanatory activities has been investigated in D\u2019Alessandro (2020),\nHafner and Mancosu (2005), Lange (2018b), and Sandborg (1997, Ch.\n1).\n\nAmongst these different explanatory activities, most of the attention\nhas been focused on proofs which not only prove that a\ntheorem is true, but also show why it is true. While there\nmight not be agreement on specific instances, many mathematicians\noften claim that certain proofs have an explanatory power and that\nothers do not. These claims are found throughout the history of\nmathematics and the philosophy of mathematics (see Lange 2015c, 2016,\n2017 (Ch. 7\u20139) and Mancosu 2001). In the words of Bouligand:\n\nMany theorems can be given different demonstrations. The most\ninstructive are of course those that let one understand the deep\nreasons of the results that one is establishing. (Bouligand, 1932, 6,\nMancosu\u2019s translation)\n\n\nAnd the real algebraic geometer Gregory Brumfiel draws a stark\ncontrast between two different types of proofs to be found in real\nalgebraic geometry, i.e., what he calls transcendental proofs (i.e.,\nproofs based on transfer theorems that infer the truth of a statement\nfor all real closed fields from its truth on a specific real closed\nfield, say the real numbers) vs. a type of proof that holds uniformly\nfor all real closed fields. The first type of proof is rejected by\nBrumfiel as non-explanatory and, by contrast, the latter provide\nexplanatory benefits. In his words:\n\nIn this book we absolutely and unequivocally refuse to give proofs of\nthis [\u2026] type [transcendental proofs]. Every result is proved\nuniformly for all real closed ground fields. Our philosophical\nobjection to transcendental proofs is that they might logically prove\na result, but they do not explain it, except for the special case of\nreal numbers. (Brumfiel 1979, 166)\n\n\nAs the previous examples show, explanatory proofs could be of several\ntypes and explain in different manners. A recent debate has focused on\nthe issue of whether proofs by induction are explanatory. On the one\nhand, Lange (2010) argues that proofs by induction are not\nexplanatory. His argument relies on the use of a form of upward and\ndownward induction from a fixed number k, with k\u22601. According to\nLange, if proofs by ordinary mathematical induction are explanatory,\nso are proofs by upward and downward induction from a fixed number k,\nwith k\u22601. But if so, then the typical asymmetry of explanations,\nwhich also holds of mathematical explanations, is not respected: for a\ncertain property P, P(1) is part of the explanation of P(k) and P(k)\nis part of the explanation of P(1). Baker (2009b) rejects\nLange\u2019s argument by arguing against the explanatory equivalence\nbetween proofs by ordinary mathematical induction and proofs by upward\nand downward induction. Hoeltje et al. (2013) reject what they see as\nan unacknowledged assumption in Lange\u2019s argument, namely that a\nuniversal sentence explains its instances. Dougherty (2017)\u2019s\nline of attack is based on Lange\u2019s need to presuppose a\nproblematic notion of identity of proofs, which he questions using an\nalternative criterion of identity spelled out using two equivalent\ncharacterizations (the first appealing to the language of homotopy\ntype theory and the second using algebraic representatives to proofs).\nBoth Baldwin (2016) and Lehet (2019) defend the explanatory value of\ninduction in mathematics: while Baldwin offers positive considerations\nas to why inductive arguments are explanatory, Lehet dwells on\ninductive definitions which \u2013 she argues \u2013 might be cases\nof explanations in mathematics.\n\nThe distinction between explanatory and non-explanatory proofs has\nalso been applied to other types of proofs, for instance proofs that\nexplain by using diagrams (see D\u2019Alessandro 2020, Brown 1997),\nor proofs that explain by drawing on analogies (see Lange 2017).\nSignificant philosophical activity has focused on those proofs that\nexplain by revealing the reasons, or the grounds, why a theorem is\ntrue. As stressed by Lange (2021c), in this context the word\n\u201cground\u201d should not be understood as connected to the\nrecent literature on metaphysical grounding (e.g., see Correia and\nSchnieder (2002)). We should rather think of the notion of\n\u201cconceptual grounding\u201d, as developed by, e.g. Smithson\n(2020). This notion of ground has an illustrious pedigree in\nphilosophers and mathematicians such as Bolzano (see Kitcher 1975,\nMancosu 1999 and Sebestik 1992) or Cournot (see Mancosu 1999), and\nrecent contributions have stressed its value in the mathematical realm\n(see Betti 2010, Detlefsen 1988, Jansson 2017, Pincock 2015b,\nPoggiolesi and Genco 2023). Indeed, just as in the scientific\nliterature it is widely accepted that causal explanations track a\ncausal relation in the world and explain by revealing the causes of\nwhy a certain fact holds, it seems reasonable to accept that (at least\ncertain) mathematical explanatory proofs track a grounding relation in\nthe mathematical realm and thus explain by mentioning the grounds or\nreasons why a theorem is true.\n",
