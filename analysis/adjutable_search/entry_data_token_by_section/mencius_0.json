    "main_text": "Life and Confucian Background\n1. Life and Confucian Background\n\n\u201cMencius\u201d is a Latinization (coined by Jesuit missionaries\nin the 17th century) of the Chinese \u201cMengzi,\u201d meaning\nMaster Meng. His full name was \u201cMeng Ke.\u201d Our main access\nto Mencius\u2019s thinking is through the eponymous collection of his\ndialogues, debates, and sayings, the Mengzi\n(Mencius). This work was probably compiled by his disciples\nor disciples of his disciples. It was subsequently edited and\nshortened by Zhao Qi in the second century C.E., who also wrote a\ncommentary on the text. This version of the text was used by\nsubsequent scholars and is the version available to us nowadays. The\nreceived text of the Mengzi is divided into seven\n\u201cbooks,\u201d each of which is subdivided into two parts\n(labeled \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d in English), and then\nfurther subdivided into \u201cchapters.\u201d As a result, a passage\ncan be uniquely identified in any translation; for example, 1A1 is the\nfirst passage in any edition or translation of the text and 7B38 is\nthe last.\n\nMencius lived in the second half of the Zhou dynasty (c.\n1040\u2013221 BCE), a period of great social and intellectual\nferment. The founders of the Zhou dynasty had justified their rule by\nclaiming that it was mandated by Heaven (ti\u0101n). Heaven\nis a higher power that is responsible for the general course of\nhistory, and that favors those with Virtue\n (d\u00e9).[1]\n However, during the Eastern Zhou period (770\u2013221 BCE), it\nseemed increasingly clear that the Zhou dynasty had lost\nHeaven\u2019s favor. The Zhou king had become merely a figurehead,\nand real power lay in the hands of the rulers (typically dukes) of the\ndifferent states into which the realm was divided. These rulers\nincreasingly usurped the power and prerogatives of the Zhou king, and\nalso waged war against each other. Those in positions of power lived\nin fear of execution or assassination, while peasants suffered under\nthe burden of heavy taxation, the depredations of bandits, and the\ndevastation of invading armies. During this period,\n\u201cmasters\u201d articulated various accounts of the Way\n(d\u00e0o, the right way to live and to organize society)\nthat would rescue people from the contemporary chaos and suffering.\nOne of these thinkers was Mencius, who self\u2013identified as a\nfollower of Confucius: \u201cEver since man came into this world,\nthere has never been one greater than Confucius\u201d (2A2; Lau 2003,\n67). Consequently, it is helpful in understanding Mencius to know\nsomething about the basic themes of Confucianism. Confucius is the\nfirst individual thinker we know of to advocate a systematic vision of\nthe Way. The Analects is traditionally viewed as a reliable\nsource of his sayings, but in contemporary scholarship there is\nconsiderable controversy over its historical\n accuracy.[2]\n Nonetheless, we clearly find in the Analects expressions of\nall the major themes that would be characteristic of Confucianism for\nthe next two and a half millennia. In particular, the Confucius of the\nAnalects emphasizes the importance of (1) revivalistic\ntraditionalism; (2) rule through Virtue rather than brute force; (3)\nritual as a model for ethical behavior; (4) the family; and (5)\nethical cultivation.\n\nConfucius saw himself as merely explicating and defending the\nteachings of the wise sage kings of the past: \u201cI transmit rather\nthan innovate. I trust in and love the ancient ways\u201d\n(Analects 7.1; Slingerland 2003, 64). However, Confucius\nhimself called for changes, sometimes radical ones, to contemporary\npractice. Like revivalists of modern times (such as Martin Luther\nKing, Jr., Gandhi, or William Sloane Coffin), Confucius sought to\nbring about positive change in the present by reviving ideals from his\nown tradition that were treated by his contemporaries as stagnant\nplatitudes. Mencius similarly took inspiration from the ancient sages.\nHowever, Mencius also stressed the need to read the classics\ncreatively and critically. Speaking of one of the Confucian classics,\nhe stated, \u201cIt would be better not to have the\nDocuments than to believe everything in it\u201d (7B3; Van\nNorden 2008, 185).\n\nOne of the lessons Confucius learned from the ancient texts was the\nimportance of ruling the people through ethical inspiration rather\nthan coercion. Many rulers and government ministers in\nConfucius\u2019s era advocated the use of military power to address\nexternal threats and strict punishments to deal with internal\ndisorder. Confucius did not completely dismiss the use of force, but\nhe regarded it as a last resort, and as ultimately ineffective when\nused as the primary method of governing. \u201cIf you try to guide\nthe common people with coercive regulations and keep them in line with\npunishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no\nsense of shame\u201d (Analects 2.3; Slingerland 2003, 8).\n(We see a similar denigration of the use of brute force in Mencius. In\na memorable turn of phrase, Mencius warned one ruler that to attempt\nto conquer the world through warfare is as hopeless as \u201cclimbing\na tree in search of a fish\u201d [1A7].) In place of penal sanctions,\nConfucius advocated leading the people by moral inspiration and by the\nsubtle but ubiquitous effect of social mores: \u201cIf, however, you\nguide them with Virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the\npeople will have a sense of shame and will rectify themselves\u201d\n(ibid.). Confucius\u2019s reference to Virtue here reflects the\nconcept\u2019s political origins. The word we render\n\u201cVirtue\u201d is \u201cde.\u201d It originally\nreferred to a sort of political charisma a king accumulated through\nhis good character and acts of kindness and generosity. Subjects would\nwillingly follow a ruler with Virtue, without the need for coercion.\nAlthough Virtue was originally something only a true king could\npossess, it came to be thought of as an attribute of any person with\ngood character (i.e., a \u201cvirtuous\u201d person), regardless of\nsocial\n status.[3]\n By the end of the Zhou dynasty, it had come to be used as a countable\nnoun referring to specific virtues, such as benevolence, courage, and\n wisdom.[4]\n Although de is thus very close to our concept of virtue, its\nassociations with royal charisma are distinctive. Consequently, it has\nbecome conventional to use \u201cVirtue\u201d (with a capital\n\u201cV\u201d) when translating the specific term\n\u201cde,\u201d and to use \u201cvirtue\u201d (with a\nlower case \u201cv\u201d) when one needs a generic term for\nreferring to traits of good character, such as righteousness and\nloyalty.\n\nAs Analects 2.3 (quoted above) suggests, ritual plays an\nimportant role in Confucius\u2019s social and ethical philosophy.\n\u201cRitual (l\u012d)\u201d originally referred to formal\nceremonies, such as burnt offerings of food and wine to the spirits of\none\u2019s ancestors. However, its meaning gradually expanded over\ntime to include etiquette (e.g., the proper way to greet or say\nfarewell to a guest) and ethics in general. Confucius stressed that\nappropriate emotions are essential to correct performance of rituals:\n\u201cSomeone who lacks magnanimity when occupying high office, who\nis not respectful when performing ritual, and who remains unmoved by\nsorrow when overseeing mourning rites\u2014how could I bear to look\nupon such a person?\u201d (Analects 3.26; Slingerland 2003,\n18) Mencius also stressed the importance of ritual. However, he\nemphasized that ritual cannot be followed inflexibly (see Section 2,\nbelow, and Mengzi 4A17, 5A2, 6B2, and Analects 9.3).\n\n\nThe family is central to Confucian ethics in at least two ways. First,\nConfucius advocates agent\u2013relative constraints on action that\nare based on familial\n relationships.[5]\n When the ruler of a state brags to Confucius that his subjects are so\n\u201cupright\u201d that a son turned in his father for stealing a\nsheep, Confucius responds, \u201cAmong my people, those who we\nconsider \u2018upright\u2019 are different from this: fathers cover\nup for their sons, and sons cover up for their fathers.\n\u2018Uprightness\u2019 is to be found in this\u201d\n(Analects 13.18; Slingerland 2003, 147). Second, the family\nis a crucial environment for nurturing virtue. Confucius\u2019s\ndisciple Youzi sketched an influential account of the role of filial\npiety in the development of complete virtue: \u201cA young person who\nis filial and respectful of his elders rarely becomes the kind of\nperson who is inclined to defy his superiors, and there has never been\na case of one who is disinclined to defy his superiors stirring up\nrebellion. The gentleman applies himself to the roots. \u2018Once the\nroots are firmly established, the Way will grow.\u2019 Might we not\nsay that filial piety and respect for elders constitute the root of\nGoodness?\u201d (Analects 1.2; Slingerland 2003, 1) We see\nhere the beginning of what became one of Mencius\u2019s most\ninfluential doctrines: that benevolence and righteousness are achieved\nthough \u201cextension\u201d of the love and respect first\nmanifested in the family.\n\nConfucius was painfully aware that virtue and the proper performance\nof the rituals are not common in his society:\n\n\nI have yet to meet a man who loves Virtue as much as he loves sex\n(Analects 9.18; cf. Slingerland 2003, 92).\n\nNowadays \u201cfilial\u201d means simply being able to provide\none\u2019s parents with nourishment. But even dogs and horses are\nprovided with nourishment. If you are not respectful, wherein lies the\ndifference? (Analects 2.7; Slingerland 2003, 10)\n\n\nConsequently, one of the central issues in Confucianism is how to\ncultivate virtues such as benevolence, loyalty, and filial piety.\nConfucius stresses the importance of both learning (by studying\nclassic texts and following the rituals) and reflecting: \u201cIf you\nlearn without reflecting, you will be lost. If you reflect without\nlearning, you will be in danger\u201d (Analects 2.15; cf.\nSlingerland 2003, 13). However, many of the debates among Confucians\nof the following two and a half millennia are about the precise form\nthat learning and reflecting take, and their relative importance (see\nIvanhoe 2000). Xunzi (discussed in Section 5, below) emphasized study\nof the classics and performance of rituals, as did Dong Zhongshu,\nwhose formulation of Confucianism was deeply influential in the Han\ndynasty (202 BCE-220 CE). In contrast, Mencius, while not denying the\nvalue of the classics and ritual, stressed reflection based upon\none\u2019s own innate dispositions toward virtue.\n\nMencius was born about a century after the death of\n Confucius.[6]\n Details of Mencius\u2019s early life are sketchy and uncertain, but\nhe is said to have been born in the state of Zou, in what is now\nShandong Province. His father supposedly died when Mencius was young,\nleaving him and his mother in poverty, and there are several famous\nstories of the determination of Mencius\u2019s mother to provide a\ngood education for her\n son.[7]\n Mencius is said to have studied under Confucius\u2019s grandson\nZisi, and then as an adult he traveled to different states in an\nattempt to convince their rulers to govern through benevolence and\nmoral suasion rather than brute force. Like the majority of later\nConfucians, Mencius was what we would describe as a \u201cpublic\nintellectual.\u201d He offered advice on everything from foreign\npolicy to the minutiae of public works. One passage from the\nMengzi is a detailed treatise on tax policy (3A3), which\nincludes Mencius\u2019s famous proposal to adopt the\n\u201cwell\u2013field system\u201d of taxation: a village\u2019s\nfields would be divided into nine equal sections, so that the borders\nbetween them looked like what we would recognize as a\ntic\u2013tac\u2013toe grid. (This shape happens to resemble the\ncharacter for \u201cwell,\u201d hence the name\n\u201cwell\u2013field.\u201d) One family would be assigned to each\nof the eight outer squares, and would keep the produce from that\nfield. Caring for the inner field would be the joint responsibility of\nall the families, and the produce from that field would belong to the\ngovernment as its tax. \n\nMencius held office in the state of Qi (2B6\u20137). During this\nperiod, he was involved in Qi\u2019s invasion of Yan, although the\nprecise nature of his role was disputed. The state of Yan was in\nturmoil due to a succession crisis. Mencius was asked, unofficially,\nwhether it might be legitimate to invade Yan to restore order. He\nreplied that it was. However, after Qi successfully invaded and\nannexed Yan, Mencius complained that he had not encouraged the\nspecific actions that Qi took, which apparently included widespread\nkilling of noncombatants and taking spoils of war (see 2B8, 1B10,\n1B11, and 2B9, in that order). Mencius eventually resigned his\nposition, when it became clear to him that the ruler was unwilling to\nenact any of the reforms that he proposed (2B10\u201313).\n\nAfter years of traveling from state to state, trying to advise rulers,\nMencius retired from public life. Mencius advocated acceptance of the\nwill of Heaven (2B13); however, he must have been disappointed with\nhis inability to improve government during his lifetime, and this is\nreflected in the plaintive tone of the closing passage of the\nMengzi: \u201cFrom Confucius to the present time is a little\nmore than one hundred years. It is not long from the era of a sage,\nand we are close to the home of a sage. Yet where is he? Where is\nhe?\u201d (7B38; Van Norden 2008, 197).\n",
