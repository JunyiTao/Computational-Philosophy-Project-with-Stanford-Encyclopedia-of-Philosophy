    "main_text": "Linguistic Turn\n6. Reception of Reinhold\u2019s Philosophy \n\nDuring Reinhold\u2019s own lifetime, or at least during certain\nphases of the same, he was among the more influential philosophers in\nGermany \u2014 first as an immensely successful popularizer of the\nKantian revolution and then, with his effort to construct an\nElementary Philosophy, as one of the founders of \u201cpost-Kantian\nidealism.\u201d This, however, nearly exhausts his positive influence\nupon his contemporaries.\n\nFollowing the heyday of German idealism, Reinhold\u2019s name has\ngenerally been relegated to the history of philosophy, within which he\nis assigned the role of serving as a small, but not insignificant rung\non the alleged ladder \u201cfrom Kant to Hegel,\u201d and this is\nprecisely how he is still treated in most general histories of\nphilosophy. In this context, Reinhold is usually credited with (or\nblamed for) putting the issues of systematic form and\n\u201cphilosophical foundations\u201d at the center of philosophical\nconcern. Even those, such as Fichte, who roundly criticized the\ndetails of his Elementary Philosophy professed sincere admiration for\nReinhold\u2019s \u201csystematic spirit.\u201d And many of those\nwho rejected his contention that the Principle of Consciousness could\nserve as the first principle of a philosophy as a whole, nevertheless\npraised him as the philosopher who first recognized the need for some\nsuch principle and first sought to provide Kantianism with a solid\n\u201cfoundation.\u201d In both of these respects, Reinhold served\nas an important catalyst or stimulus for further philosophical\ndevelopments.\n\nGiven this situation, it his hardly surprising that until recently the\nonly works of Reinhold familiar even to most scholars\u2014with a few\nminor exceptions\u2014were the Letters on the Kantian\nPhilosophy and the three, above-mentioned volumes in which he\nexpounded his Elementary Philosophy. This, however, is unfortunate,\ninasmuch as these texts represent only a small fraction of\nReinhold\u2019s literary output and do not include some of his most\noriginal ideas, projects, and literary productions, such as his final\nwritings on philosophy and language and his pioneering, lifelong\nefforts to get philosophers to take seriously the history of their own\ndiscipline and to understand the \u201chistory of philosophy\u201d\nphilosophically.\n\nThis situation has begun to change, however. The first critical\nedition of Reinhold\u2019s complete works, Karl Leonhard\nReinhold: Gesammelte Schriften, was inaugurated in 2007.\nFurthermore, the critical edition of Reinhold\u2019s voluminous and\nimportant philosophical correspondence, Karl Leonhard Reinhold:\nKorrespondenzausgabe, has resumed regular output since 2007,\nafter a 25-year hiatus. Newly edited editions of some of\nReinhold\u2019s major works have also begun to appear, most notably\nthe two volumes of his Beytr\u00e4ge zur Berichtigung bisheriger\nMissverst\u00e4ndnisse der Philosophen, edited by Faustino\nFabbianelli, and an edition of Versuch einer neuen Theorie des\nmenschlichen Vorstellungsverm\u00f6gen, edited by Ernst-Otto\nOnnasch, all issued in the \u201cPhilosophische Bibliothek\u201d\nseries published by Felix Meiner.\n\nFor many years, the serious secondary literary on Reinhold was very\nsparse and was dominated by Alfred Klimmt\u2019s monograph (see\nbelow). Recent years, however, have seen a spate of new articles and\nmonographs devoted to Reinhold. Also worth mentioning is Alexander von\nSch\u00f6nborn\u2019s annotated bibliography of Reinhold\u2019s\nwritings, a fine example of scholarly detective work and an essential\ntool for further research. In conjunction with and as part of the\nrenaissance of Fichte studies over the past decades, there have been\nnumerous efforts to reexamine the relationship between Reinhold and\nFichte, and, in particular, to reassess the precise debt of the\nWissenschaftslehre to the Elementary Philosophy. Accordingly,\nthe scholarly literature on Fichte includes numerous studies of this\naspect of Reinhold\u2019s achievement. Even more recently and for the\nfirst time ever, Reinhold\u2019s ideas have begun to be expounded,\ncriticized, and debated among Anglophone scholars and philosophers,\nincluding Karl Ameriks, Frederick C. Beiser, Daniel Breazeale, Paul\nGuyer, Paul Franks, Michelle Kosch, and Alexander von\nSch\u00f6nborn.\n\nAppreciation and discussion of Reinhold among Anglophone readers can\nbe expected to spread more widely as more of Reinhold\u2019s writings\nbecome available in English. Recently, several partial translations of\nworks by Reinhold have appeared: one, by George di Giovanni, of\nexcerpts from the Fundament; another, by Sabine Rohr, of\nportions of the Verhandlung \u00fcber die Grundbegriffe und\nGrunds\u00e4tze der Moralit\u00e4t aus dem Gesichtspunke des gemeinen\nund gesunden Verstandes; and two, by J\u00f6rg Noller and John\nWalsh, of excerpts from the Beytr\u00e4ge II and\nVermischter Schriften II relevant to the post-Kantian debate\non free will. In 2005 a fine translation of the first series of\nReinhold\u2019s \u201cLetters on the Kantian Philosophy,\u201d\ntranslated by James Hebbeler and edited by Karl Ameriks, was published\nin the series of \u201cCambridge Texts in the History of\nPhilosophy.\u201d Furthermore, a translation of the second volume of\nReinhold\u2019s Letters on the Kantian Philosophy is\ncurrently underway. The rest of Reinhold\u2019s philosophical\nwritings still await English translation.\n\nIn 1998 Reinhold\u2019s philosophy was the subject of an\ninternational academic conference\u2014the first such conference ever\nto be devoted to Reinhold\u2014in Bad Homburg, Germany. The second\ninternational Reinhold conference was held in Luzern, Switzerland in\n2002; the third, in Rome, Italy in 2004; the fourth in Montreal,\nCanada in 2007; the fifth in Siegen, Germany in 2010; and the sixth in\nKiel, Germany in 2017. (The proceedings of the first five of these\nconferences have been published.) The level of scholarship and\nphilosophical acumen on display at these two events was very high and\naugurs well for the future. Indeed, one could argue that the future of\nReinhold Studies is brighter today than at any time since\nReinhold\u2019s death.\n",
