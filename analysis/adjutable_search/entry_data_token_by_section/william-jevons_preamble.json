    "main_text": "\n\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons (1835\u20131882) was an economist and\nphilosopher who foreshadowed several developments of the 20th century.\nHe is one of the main contributors to the \u2018marginal\nrevolution\u2019, which revolutionised economic theory and shifted\nclassical to neoclassical economics.  He was the first economist to\nconstruct index numbers, and he had a tremendous influence on the\ndevelopment of empirical methods and the use of statistics and\neconometrics in the social sciences.  His philosophy can be seen as a\nprecursor of logical empiricism, but because of the peculiar form of\nhis logic, he would not have many direct followers.  His textbooks on\nlogic were widely used in class and reprinted many times. \n",
