    "main_text": "Writings on Value Judgment, Humanism, and Religion\n5. Writings on Value Judgment, Humanism, and Religion\n\nFeigl\u2019s writings on practical issues like ethics, humanism, and\nreligion are rather less well known (but see, rather recently, the\nreconstruction in Siegetsleitner 2014, ch. 11). Still, they are worth\nconsidering, especially since they contain some interesting\napplications and extensions of the logical empiricist agenda. The\nall-embracing idea, though, came from the eighteenth century:\nAccording to Feigl, \u201ca new age of enlightenment, scientific as\nwell as ethical, is our most imperative need\u201d (1981, p. 406).\nTherefore, \u201c[t]he straightforward spirit of eighteenth-century\nEnlightenment (e.g. Hume, Kant) needs reviving and\n\u2018updating\u2019\u201d (1981, p. 399). The programmatic frame\nfor this \u2018updating\u2019 Feigl labeled \u201cscientific\nhumanism\u201d (ibid., pp. 368, 405, 408, 418)\u2014by which he\nunderstood the attempt at a \u201csynthesis of the scientific\nattitude with an active interest in the whole scale of human\nvalues\u201d (ibid., p. 368). It was this conception within which he\ntheorized about the relationships between ethics and logic and between\nreligion and empirical science.\n\nAs concerns the relationship between ethics and logic, Feigl draws a\nprincipled distinction between two kinds of justification:\n\u201cvindication\u201d and \u201cvalidation\u201d (see Feigl\n1981, pp. 14, 256\u2013260, 385). While validation \u201cinvolves\nreliance upon the principles of logic\u201d (ibid., p. 245),\nvindication has to do with the pragmatics of evaluating certain types\nof behavior with respect to certain ends. Thus the latter, pragmatic,\nform of justification may be called \u2018justificatio\nactionis,\u2019 whereas the former, logical, form of\njustification may be called \u2018justificatio\ncognitionis\u2019 (see ibid., p. 385). Feigl\u2019s point,\nthen, is to show that specific ethical norms are capable of being\nvalidated, but that general ethical principles (and the respective\nethical systems) are only capable of being vindicated. Feigl\nwrites:\n\nValidation terminates with the exhibition of the norms that govern the\nrealm of argument concerned. If any further question can be raised at\nall, it must be the question concerning the pragmatic justification\n(vindication) of the (act of) adoption of the validating principles.\nBut this is a question of an entirely different kind. (1981, p. 386)\n\n\nTwo things should be noted here. First, in contrast to other logical\nempiricist accounts of ethics (for example, in the fist place, A.J.\nAyer\u2019s), Feigl\u2019s conception is, as has been argued (see\nKellerwessel 2010), committed to a certain form of\ncognitivism. That means that \u201cmoral judgments are to be\nreconstructed as knowledge-claims and as subject to validation (or\ninvalidation) by virtue of their accordance (or non-accordance) with\nthe supreme norms of a given ethical system\u201d (Feigl 1981, p.\n388). Accordingly, within such a given ethical system, moral\nreasoning can be justified by the \u201crules of deductive and\ninductive inference\u201d (ibid., p. 385) and thus be reconstructed\nalong cognitive, i.e. rational, lines. However, secondly, the\nrespective ethical system (and its \u201csupreme norms\u201d) itself\ncan only be vindicated by pragmatic maxims. Thus, Feigl\nallows the possibility of a \u201cpragmatic justification of the\nadoption of an alternative frame\u201d (ibid., p. 386), thereby\nimplying that there exists a plurality of alternative ethical systems.\nIt is interesting to see that Feigl refers the reader here to\nCarnap\u2019s distinction between \u201cinternal\u201d and\n\u201cexternal\u201d questions in his 1950 \u201cEmpiricism,\nSemantics, and Ontology\u201d (see Feigl 1981, p. 391, Fn. 3; see\nfurther Feigl 1981, pp. 13\u201314). Indeed, there is a deep analogy\nbetween this distinction drawn by Carnap and Feigl\u2019s distinction\nbetween the validation within an ethical system and the\nvindication of the ethical system (and its supreme norms)\nitself. Furthermore, it can be stated that Feigl, in his pragmatic\nargument for scientific realism, was also inspired by\nCarnap\u2019s distinction and its relativization of the ontological\ndimension (see, for further details, Neuber 2011, p. 179).\n\nOn the whole, scientific humanism is designed to avoid the extremes.\nIt qualifies, according to Feigl, as \u201ca tenable middle ground\nbetween the relativists and the absolutists in morals\u201d (1981, p.\n417). In contrast to relativism, it is assumed that certain basic\nhuman values, such as justice, fairness or equality, are universally\napplicable. However, in contrast to (for instance, Kantian)\nabsolutism, it is at the same time assumed that those values are\nrelated to human interests and thus empirically variable. They\n\u201cmay have come out of the natural development of human beings in\nthe social context\u201d (ibid., p. 420), and they can only be\njustified pragmatically (by way of vindication). But, Feigl maintains,\nthat does not make them arbitrary: \u201cIf we dig deeper into human\nnature we find that in some social contexts certain moral ideals\ninevitably work themselves out\u201d (ibid., p. 418). In the\n\u201cage of scientific enlightenment\u201d (ibid., p. 420) an\nethically disinterested or even cynical view of the world is therefore\nout of place: \u201cPsychology points in the direction of human needs\nand interests that must be satisfied. And in the social context,\ncertain traffic rules simply have to be obeyed if we are to survive as\na society. Thus we have ideals of justice and equality.\u201d\n(ibid.)\n\nFeigl\u2019s broadly naturalistic view of human beings and the world,\ntogether with the (liberalized) logical empiricist criterion of\nmeaning, entails a constructive but at the same time critical approach\ntoward religion. To be sure, Feigl did not deny the existence of\nreligious experiences (see, for example, Feigl 1981, 399\u2013400).\nBut he did not \u201csee [\u2026] the slightest reason for\naccepting any sort of theology\u201d (ibid., p. 399).\nAlthough some of the dogmas of theology were seen by Feigl as\n\u201cperfectly meaningful\u201d (ibid., p. 13), he conceived of\nthem as being false (or as being extremely unlikely). The option of a\n\u201cdemythologized\u201d (or modernized) theology\u00a0(Tillich,\nBultmann, Bonhoeffer, and others) is, Feigl further maintained,\n\u201cno longer a theology at all; it reduces to a moral message,\nformulated by the use of allegorical, but essentially exhorting,\nconsoling, edifying, or fortifying language\u201d (ibid., p. 406). By\naccepting scientific humanism, on the other hand, we are, according to\nFeigl, in a position to \u201cadopt an ethics without supernatural\nfoundation or supernatural sanctions\u201d (ibid., p. 405). Religious\nexperiences, in turn, are then explainable in purely naturalistic\nterms. They do not serve as the basis of scientific or everyday\nexplanation of human behavior. Rather, they are themselves\nsubject of scientific explanation. Or, in Feigl\u2019s own\nwords: \u201c[W]e do not need the theistic kind of reasoning in order\nto account for the phenomenon of religious experience. The influence\nof the cultural and moral traditions as well as psychology can provide\na very plausible naturalistic explanation of religious experience. As\nVoltaire once put it, if God didn\u2019t exist, he would have to be\ninvented.\u201d (ibid., pp. 415\u2013416)\n\nThree further points concerning Feigl\u2019s scientific humanism call\nfor comment. First, Feigl\u2019s early affiliation with American\nUnitarianism; second, his involvement in the American Humanist\nAssociation; third, the background to his plea for scientific humanism\nin Roy Wood Sellars\u2019 contributions in that field.\n\nOn the first point, suffice it to mention that Feigl served as\npresident of the Men\u2019s Club of the First Unitarian Church in\nIowa City as early as 1937\u201338 and that he still gave talks at the\nFirst Unitarian Society of Minneapolis in the late 1950s. Unitarian\nideals were values such as individual freedom, democratic processes in\nhuman relations, and universal brotherhood, undivided by nations,\nrace, or creed.\n\nThese ideals came very close to those of the American Humanist\nAssociation, which was founded in 1941. In 1944 Feigl was elected\nassistant secretary of the\u00a0Association. In retrospect, he writes:\n\n\n[O]ur attitude toward theology and religion was that of the naturalist\nor scientific humanists. Indeed, several of us found in the general\nposition of the American Humanist Association an ideology that seemed\nvery similar to our basic philosophical attitude. If, as most\nhumanists prefer, \u2018religion\u2019 is not connected with any\ntheology whatever, then a deep commitment to such human values as\nbasic and equal rights, the civil liberties, the ideal of a peaceful\nand harmonious world community, may well be said to be the religion of\nthe humanists \u2013 and of the positivists. (Feigl 1981, pp.\n78\u201379)\n\nBy \u2018us,\u2019 Feigl meant the emigrated logical empiricists.\nPhilipp Frank, in particular, also championed the humanist idea (see\nFrank 2021). \n\nAs for the influence of Roy Wood Sellars, the first thing to note is\nthat Sellars as early as 1918 had published a book titled The Next\nStep in Religion. In the preface to that book, Sellars made it\nclear that \u201cthe deepest spiritual life has always concerned\nitself with the appreciation and maintenance of values. He who\nacknowledges, and wishes to further, human values cannot be said to be\nirreligious or unspiritual\u201d (Sellars 1918, Foreword). Moreover,\nSellars pointed out: \u201cSuch attitudes and expectations as prayer,\nritual, worship, immortality, providence, are expressions of the\npre-scientific view of the world. But as man partly outgrows, partly\nlearns to reject the primitive thought of the world, this perspective\nand these elements will drop from religion.\u201d (p. 6) On this\nbasis, religion is redefined as \u201cloyalty to the values of\nlife\u201d (p. 7). In fact, Sellars\u2019 approach is deeply\nrooted in an appreciation of the progress of science (see esp. Sellars\n1918, ch. XVI) and thus comes quite close to Feigl\u2019s\nunderstanding of what he called scientific humanism. Moreover, Feigl\nhad certainly read the Humanist Manifesto, which Sellars,\ntogether with Raymond B. Bragg, had co-edited in 1933 (see Kurtz\n1973). As late as 1980, Feigl (like Willard von Orman Quine, A. J.\nAyer, and Sidney Hook) signed the Secular Humanist\nDeclaration of the Council for Democratic and Secular\nHumanism (see Kurtz 1983).\n\nMore recently, a view very close to Feigl\u2019s scientific humanism\nhas been advocated by Ronald Dworkin, according to whom\n\u201creligion is deeper than God\u201d (Dworkin 2013:1) and the\nreligious attitude \u201caccepts the full, independent reality of\nvalues\u201d (10). Like Feigl and Sellars, Dworkin views science as a\nparadigm for promoting human values.\n",
