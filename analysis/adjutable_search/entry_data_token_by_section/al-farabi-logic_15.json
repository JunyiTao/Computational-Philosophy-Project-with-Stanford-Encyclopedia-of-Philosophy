    "main_text": "Foundations of Arabic\n10. Poetry and Music\n\nFor al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, music theory sits on the very edge of\nbeing a syllogistic art along with rhetoric and poetry:\n\n\n\u2026 it becomes clear that [the theoretical art of music] has much\nin common with that of the scholars in the linguistic arts from the\npeople of each tongue, and has much in common with the art of rhetoric\nand the art of poetry, both of which are parts of the art of logic in\nmany things. ([Music] 173)\n\n\nThe link to poetry is clear, he tells us, given that poetry is\nperfected by being set to music. Besides this there are formal\nsimilarities: poetry is formed by concatenating letters from a finite\nalphabet, and music is formed by concatenating sounds from a finite\npalette. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b grants that in the case of music the\npalette is dictated by nature, whereas the letters of a national\nalphabet are adopted by convention in that nation ([Music]\n120f). But he notes that in some cultures the music accompanying a\npoem is counted as a part of the poem, and that this can be justified\nby the fact that sometimes the poetic metre is sustained by the music\nrather than the words ([Poetry]\n 91.15\u201317).[27]\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never considers music on its own as a\nsyllogistic art. There is an obvious reason for this, namely that\nmusic is not built of words, and syllogisms (by Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition which al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b cites at\n[Syllogism] 19.8) are a form of verbal discourse\n(qawl). But this requires only that the premises are verbal;\nthe conclusion, on both Aristotle\u2019s definition and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s own quoted in\n Section 7\n above, is simply a \u201cthing\u201d. Already in Aristotle the\nconclusion of a practical syllogism is an action, not a proposition.\n(Thus Aristotle, De Motu Animalium 7, 701a11: \u201cThe two\npropositions result in a conclusion which is an action\u201d.)\n\nIn what sense is it true that poetry contains words that compel assent\nto something that one didn\u2019t previously know?\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b discusses this question in three essays:\n[Canons], [Poetry], and [Proportion]. In\nall of them, part of his answer is that poetry excites our imagination\nand thereby persuades us to adopt certain attitudes. \n\nThis takes \u201csyllogism\u201d in a very weak sense. But in all\nthree works al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b also indicates that poetry\ncontains text that is \u201cpotentially\u201d a syllogism. His only\nexamples, in [Proportion] 505.22f, yield invalid categorical\nsyllogisms in second figure, as follows (see Aouad & Schoeler\n2002):\n\nThe person is beautiful. The sun is beautiful. Therefore the\nperson is a\n sun.[28]\nFire acts quickly. The sword acts quickly, viz. to kill. Therefore\nthe sword is a fire.\n\n\nHis point can be teased out in several different ways; the reader may\nhave better suggestions than ours. But here at least is a reading that\nmatches al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s text. Consider the following\nline of Ab\u016b Tamm\u0101m, in a poem written in 838 to celebrate a\nmilitary victory:\n\n\nKnowledge lies in the bright spears gleaming between two armies.\n(translated in Stetkevych 2002: 156) \n\n\nReading this in context, we realize that the poet is telling us that\nthe weapons gave certainty through a decisive victory. Knowledge is\nwhat gives certainty. So we can expand the text by what it brings to\nmind:\n\n\nThe spears give certainty. Knowledge gives certainty. Therefore the\nspears are knowledge.\n\n\nThis is not deductive reasoning. It\u2019s a verbalizing of thoughts\nthat the poem brings to our minds. Spelling it out, we are drawn to\nappreciate the fact that the battle resolved the situation. The text\nis an invalid syllogism in just the same way as\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s two examples above, but the fact that\nit is in second figure is really neither here nor there. \n\nNote that in this case the poem provides the conclusion, not the\npremises. So it fits Black\u2019s (1990: 226) description that\n\u201cWhat appears in the finished product is not a poetic syllogism\n\u2026 but only its conclusion\u201d. Are the hearers supposed to\nreconstruct the poet\u2019s premises by telepathy? Black leaves the\nproblem open, but in fact it\u2019s a problem we have met before. In\n[Syllogism] 19.10f al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us that\n\n\nA syllogism is just composed to reach a quaesitum which was\npreviously defined; the quaesitum was assumed first and one\nseeks to verify it by a syllogism.\n\n\nThis applies in various contexts, for example, when the questioner in\na debate has the task of finding a syllogism to refute the\nresponder\u2019s claim; \u201cthe enquiry is always about a\nquaesitum whose syllogism has not yet been found\u201d\n([Debate] 45.6). In the poetical case the hearers have the\ntask of finding a middle term that generates a poetic syllogism; in\nour example the middle term is \u201cgiving certainty\u201d. And\nagain, the premises yield the conclusion by imaginative suggestion,\nnot by deduction.\n\nThere remain some problems with al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\naccount of poetic syllogisms. First, he never says that only the\nconclusion appears in the poem. Black (1990: 235\u20138) suggests\nthat the practical syllogism might be a key to understanding other\ncases. \n\nSecond, why does al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b say in [Canons]\n268.15 that \u201cpoetic discourse is in all cases absolutely\nfalse\u201d? This is a gross exaggeration, and it raises the question\nwhether a poet can really expect the audience to assent to a pack of\nlies. It seems we can handle this problem.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s statement in [Canons] is a\ntypical Neoplatonist soundbite, witness the Alexandrian Elias (In\nCategorias Prooemium 117.2\u20135):\n\n\nEither all the premises [of the syllogism] are true, making it\ndemonstrative, or they are all false and they make it poetic and\nmythic, or some are true and some are false \u2026. \n\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s own more mature view, in\n[Proportion] 506.3f, is that\n\n\nPoetry doesn\u2019t aim either to tell lies or not to tell them; its\naim and purpose is to arouse the imagination and the passion of the\nsoul. \n\n\nAnd even if some blatant lies do occur, we would surely admit (though\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself never quite says it in the texts that\nwe have) that a false statement may still contain poetic truth.\n",
