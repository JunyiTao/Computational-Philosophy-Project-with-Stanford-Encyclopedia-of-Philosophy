    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy has been divided into theoretical and practical since the\ntime of Aristotle\u2019s distinction of the sciences, and within\ntheoretical philosophy, the enquire on nature was of major import in\nAncient and Medieval times. Most of its contents later developed into\nmodern natural science as the seeds of physics or chemistry, but its\nfounding concepts are still worth reflecting upon. Concepts such as\nthose of body and extension, motion and change, time and place,\nfiniteness and infiniteness, and of nature itself have kept their\nphilosophical gist.\n\nThe Iranian philosopher Ibn Sina [Avicenna] (d. 1037 CE) organized his\nphilosophical encyclopedia \u201cThe Healing\u201d in four sections:\nLogic, mathematical, and natural sciences, and sciences of the Divine;\nthe doctrine on the human soul was part of the natural sciences. The\nAndalusian Ibn Rushd [Averroes] (d. 1198 CE) was a faithful disciple\nof Aristotle and he stuck to the organization of the Aristotelian\ncorpus implemented by Andronicus of Rhodes (fl. 1st century BCE), a\nscholar of the Peripatetic school who gave the science of the soul a\nplace of its own, as would Averroes. On the Soul belongs to\nthe physical works, but it is devoted to living natural beings with\nconsiderable focus on humans and their capacities for sensation and\nthought, and Andronicus placed it after the first four physical\ntreatises and before metaphysics. The mentioned treatises are the\nPhysics, On the Heavens, On Generation and\nCorruption, and the Meteorology.\n\nWe may say that the Physics, which is the first and the\nlongest treatise on natural philosophy (184a\u2013267b in\nBekker\u2019s numbering) contains a number of Aristotelian books that\ndeal with key issues of this science, but Averroes was not aware of\nthis fact that modern research has brought to light. His work was\nbased on the belief in the unity of the treatise, so that he always\nstrove for a coherent, unified reading and interpretation of\nAristotle.\n\nAverroes composed Long, Middle, and Short commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics and some essays,\nmas\u0101\u2019il, quaestiones, on physical\nmatters. The Middle and Short commentaries were revised by Averroes\nhimself, and the Long Commentary shows traces of revision, but in\ngeneral, the Long Commentary represents the last stage of his thought.\nThe Middle Commentaries were favored by later Jewish philosophers,\nbut, as S. Harvey has shown, the Long Commentary on the\nPhysics was soon translated into Hebrew and also drew their\ninterest (Harvey 1985). The Long Commentary was the most influential\nof the three in the Latin West and a recent collective publication\nhighlights its influence in the field of natural philosophy (Bakker\n2015). For this reason the research for this article will rely mainly\non the Long Commentary, but additionally on his Middle Commentary on\nComing-to-be and Passing-away (De generatione et\ncorruptione). The Physics focuses on one kind of change,\nnamely, local motion, while the latter deals with three othe kinds:\nchanges in substance, quality and quantity. Occasional references to\nthe other commentaries, or to other works, will be made.\n",
