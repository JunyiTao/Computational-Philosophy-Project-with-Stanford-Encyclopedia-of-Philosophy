    "main_text": "Political Philosophy in the Roman Empire || Platonisms and Other Philosophies in the Empire\n7.2 Platonisms and Other Philosophies in the Empire\n\nWhile the men of affairs in the Roman Senate and imperial court turned\noften (though not exclusively) to Stoicism, in the Greek centers of\nphilosophy and among provincial Greek men of affairs Platonism\nremained an important framework for thinking about both ethics and\npolitics, as did a related if somewhat shadowy form of\n Pythagoreanism\n which can be seen as a continuation of the genre of Hellenistic\nkingship treatises (Centrone 2000). The most important contributions\nmade to political thought by the Platonist philosopher of the\nsecond-century AD, Plutarch (c.46\u2013c.120 CE), are his paired\nbiographical lives of Greek and Roman statesmen, each with a\ncomparison drawing political morals. Together with the histories of\nThucydides, Livy and Sallust, these Lives instructed\ngenerations of students in the principles and perils of political\nethics, and instituted the distinction between statesman and demagogue\nas we have come to know it today: with figures like the fifth-century\nBCE Athenian \u201cAristides the Just\u201d embodying the ideal\nstatesmen, in contrast to the Platonic view of all past and present\nstatesmen as fatally flawed. Plutarch also made important\ncontributions to political philosophy in the many essays collected in\nhis volumes of Moralia.\n\nPlutarch was a committed but in some ways revisionist Platonist. His\nattitude to public life was more Roman than Platonic (befitting the\nrole in public affairs that he played in his own city): the political\nlife was for him unproblematically noble, not inferior to the life of\nphilosophy. Similarly, he revised the strict Platonic dictum that\nphilosophers must rule by allowing that philosophers might rule merely\nin the sense of advising rulers, not of being rulers themselves. (In\nfact, this move had some Platonic pedigree in the\nStatesman\u2019s insistence that the science of statecraft\nis the same whether known and exercised by an advisor or by an actual\nruler (259a).) And he considered philosophy to be more of a\ncharacter-building study than a source of knowledge of exact or\npolitically relevant knowledge. Where statesmen were educated in\nphilosophy, as for example in the Lives of Pericles, Cicero,\nBrutus, and Cato Minor, he treats this as valuable mainly because of\nthe virtue\u2014in particular, moderation and\nself-restraint\u2014which it imparts to them (Van Raalte 2005). The\nstudy of philosophy serves as a sort of inoculation against greed and\nimmoderate ambition. But it need not impart any particular substantive\nknowledge to the statesman (so competing philosophies could all be\nuseful in shaping virtue: Anaxagaorean influence on Pericles, an\neclectic mixture of Stoicism, Academic skepticism, and Platonism on\nCicero; Stoicism on the younger Cato). Indeed, excessively rigid\nadherence to a philosophy could be deleterious, making a statesman\nrigid and inflexible. The younger Cato was defeated when he stood for\nthe consulship because, Plutarch says, he experienced the same thing\nthat happens to fruits that appear \u201cout of season\u201d\n(Phoc. 3.1). Like such fruits, he was admired, but \u201cthe\nweight and grandeur\u201d of his virtue was \u201cout of all\nproportion to the immediate times\u201d (asummetron tois\nkathest\u014dsi kairois, Phoc. 3.2\u20133).\n\nPlutarch\u2019s political sympathies lay with monarchy. He treated\nthe exemplary Greek or Roman statesman as inherently and ideally a\nkind of monarchical figure, even when functioning within a democratic\nor republican environment. \u201cAristocratic and kingly\u201d was\nhis praise for Pericles\u2019 type of true statesmanship (literally,\nhis \u201cpolitics\u201d or \u201cpolicy\u201d,\npoliteia), once he has given up his initial recourse to\ndemagogic methods (Per.14.2). Thus for all his admiration for\nGreek statesmen of the classical age, and his profound later influence\non republican sentiments in Europe, Plutarch preferred monarchy as the\nbest constitution and believed that he was following his master Plato\nin so doing. As John Dillon puts it, he held \u201cthat the\naccomplished statesman, like a first-rate musician, will be able to\nmake the best of any of the three basic constitutions [monarchy,\naristocracy, or democracy] that he is given to work on\u201d (Dillon\n1997). To quote Plutarch himself on this point from his fragmentary\nwriting \u201cOn Monarchy, Democracy, and Oligarchy\u201d:\n\n\u2026if he [the statesman] is given the choice among governments,\nlike so many tools, he would follow Plato\u2019s advice and choose no\nother than monarchy, the only one which is able to sustain that top\nnote of virtue, high in the highest sense, and never let it be tuned\ndown under compulsion or expediency. For the other forms of government\nin a certain sense, although controlled by the statesman, control him,\nand although carried along by him, carry him along, since he has no\nfirmly established strength to oppose those from whom his strength is\nderived\u2026. (Peri mon. 827bc)\n\n\nPlato\u2019s collective virtuous aristocracy in the Republic\n(his philosopher-kings and -queens, in the plural), was transmuted by\nPlutarch, perhaps under the influence of the singular kingly political\nexpert in the Statesman, into a monarchical\n ideal.[16]\n\nLater Platonic philosophers, known as Neoplatonists (see the entry on\n Plotinus),\n also focused primarily on ethics in the context of cosmology and\ntheology, stressing the ascent of the soul to a disembodied pure\nunderstanding of the One. Yet they made room for the political virtues\nof the embodied soul as a first step in this process of divinization\nor \u201cbecoming like God\u201d (O\u2019Meara 2003). In working\nout the political implications of such views, Plato\u2019s\nLaws became an important model for theocratic political\nreform, especially as Neoplatonism became influential for a certain\nstrand of Christian thinkers, in particular those able to absorb the\ntranslation of Greek texts into Arabic.\n",
