    "main_text": "\n\nThe economic, political, and social frameworks that each society \nhas\u2014its laws, institutions, policies, etc.\u2014result in\ndifferent distributions of benefits and burdens across members of the\nsociety. These frameworks are the result of human political processes\nand they constantly change both across societies and within societies\nover time. The structure of these frameworks is important because the\ndistributions of benefits and burdens resulting from them\nfundamentally affect people\u2019s lives. Arguments about which\nframeworks and/or resulting distributions are morally preferable\nconstitute the topic of distributive justice. Principles of\ndistributive justice are therefore best thought of as providing moral\nguidance for the political processes and structures that affect the\ndistribution of benefits and burdens in societies, and any principles\nwhich do offer this kind of moral guidance on distribution, regardless\nof the terminology they employ, should be considered principles of\ndistributive justice.\n\nThis entry is structured in the following way. After outlining the\nscope of the entry and the role of distributive principles, the first\nrelatively simple principle of distributive justice examined is Strict\nEgalitarianism, which calls for the allocation of equal material goods\nto all members of society. John Rawls\u2019 alternative distributive\nprinciple, which he calls the Difference Principle, is examined next.\nThe Difference Principle permits diverging from strict equality so\nlong as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged\nin society materially better off than they would be under strict\nequality. Some have thought that neither strict equality nor\nRawls\u2019 Difference Principle capture the important moral roles of\nluck and responsibility. The \u201cLuck Egalitarianism\u201d\nliterature comprises varying attempts to design distributive\nprinciples that are appropriately sensitive to considerations of\nresponsibility and luck. Desert-based principles similarly emphasize\nthe moral roles of responsibility and luck but are distinct because\nthey approach these factors through claims about what people deserve\nbecause of their work.\n\nAdvocates of welfare-based principles (of which utilitarianism is the\nmost famous) do not believe the primary distributive concern should be\nmaterial goods and services. They argue that material goods and\nservices have no intrinsic value but are valuable only in so far as\nthey increase welfare. Hence, they argue, distributive principles\nshould be designed and assessed according to how they affect welfare,\neither its maximization or distribution. Advocates of libertarian\nprinciples, by contrast to each of the principles so far mentioned,\ngenerally criticize any distributive ideal that requires the pursuit\nof specific \u2018patterns\u2019, such as maximization or equality\nof welfare or of material goods. They argue that the pursuit of such\npatterns conflicts with the more important moral demands of liberty or\nself-ownership. Finally, feminist critiques of existing distributive\nprinciples note that they tend to ignore the particular circumstances\nof women, so feminists tend to argue for principles which are more\nsensitive to facts such as that women often have primary\nresponsibility for child-rearing and on average, spend less of their\nlifetimes than men in the market economy. \n",
