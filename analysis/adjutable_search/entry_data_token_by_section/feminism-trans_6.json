    "main_text": "The Empire Strikes Back || The Transgender Paradigm\n4.3 The Transgender Paradigm\n\n\nStone's article laid the foundations for the emergence of\ntransgender studies, which can be characterized as the\ncoming-to-academic-voice of (some) trans people against a history of\nscholarly objectification. The early nineties also witnessed the\nemergence of current transgender politics, articulated in the popular\nworks of Leslie Feinberg (1992, 1993, 1996, 1998) and Kate Bornstein\n(1994). Three major features of what might be called the transgender\nparadigm paralleled the ideas of Stone: 1) the recognition of\ngender-based oppression, usually targeting trans people, as distinct\nfrom and non-reducible to sexist oppression; 2) the positioning of\ntrans people as problematically situated with respect to the binary\ncategories man and woman; and 3) the endorsement\nof a politics of visibility.\n\n\nThis is not to suggest that such politics are uniform. For example,\nwhile Feinberg tends to emphasize the historical persistence of\ntransgender people as a kind of people or oppressed group, Bornstein\ntends to emphasize the constructed (and oppressive) nature of gender\ncategories as a whole, the desirability of viewing gender as fashion,\nand the importance of moving toward a more consensual gender system.\nNotably, Bornstein draws on the ethnomethodological work of Garfinkel\n(1967) and Kessler and McKenna (1977). The work of Kessler and McKenna\nis especially remarkable for its early broad use of\n\u2018gender\u2019 to apply even to biological sex in order to\nindicate the implication of sex within cultural interpretation and\npractice. Ethnomethodology is a sociological analysis of how\nindividuals construct their common-sense knowledge of the world in\nsocial contexts. Bornstein draws principally on Garfinkel's\nnotion of the natural attitude about sex. This attitude, for\nGarfinkel, constitutes the everyday \u201ccommon-sense\u201d about\nsex. It is held by those he dubbed \u201cnormals\u201d for whom the\ncategories male and female are exclusive, exhaustive, invariant, and\napplied on the basis of genitalia. Notably, part of the natural\nattitude involves dismissing counter-examples (e.g., intersexual\nindividuals who show that the neat categorization of humans into two\ndiscrete categories is bogus) as abnormal and aberrant. \n\n\nAt any rate, these and other popular works characterized and perhaps\nprovided the foundation for the emerging Anglo-American transgender\npolitics of the 1990s which while insisting upon the distinction\nbetween gender identity and presentation (on the one hand) and sexual\norientation (on the other) also fought for representation within LGB\npolitics. This led to the development of a somewhat more inclusive LGBT\npolitics, grounded in the idea that gender-variant individuals had\nalways, in the first place, been central to gay and lesbian liberation\nand that gay and lesbian individuals themselves may be subject to\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender presentation.\n\n\nThe emergence of transgender politics included the prolonged\nconflict between trans activists and non trans feminists over the\nexclusion of trans women from the Michigan Womyn's Music\nFestival. In 1994, the trans activist group, Transexual Menace,\norganized \u2018Camp Trans\u2019 directly opposite the festival. (The\nterm transexual, spelled with one s, was intended to\nsignal a break from the traditional medical conception of\ntranssexuality). The point was to challenge what was seen as the\nfestival organizers' transphobic attempt to exclude trans women\nthrough its \u2018womyn-born womyn\u2019 policy. The political\nconflict persists to this day.\n\n\nIn 1994, The Transsexual Empire was re-issued with a new\nintroduction by Raymond that explicitly takes up the new transgender\npolitics. Her critique largely involves the claim that any gender\ntransgression by transgender people still involves the uptake of sexist\ngender roles and therefore fails at genuine gender transcendence (1994,\nxxix). In Raymond's view, most self-identified transgender people\nare predominantly men who are in some way performing a stereotypical\nand sexist femininity (ibid.). However, she also discusses\nFeinberg's Stone Butch Blues, a novel which played an\nimportant, informative role in the emergence of transgender politics.\nIn this novel, we follow the lead protagonist, Jess, who moves from the\ncategory of butch (in butch-femme lesbian subculture) to the\ncategory transsexual, and who then recognizes that transition\nfrom female to male is likewise unfulfilling. Jess ends up occupying a\nmiddle ground, identifying simply as a \u2018he-she.\u2019\nRaymond's major concern with this trajectory is that,\nJess ultimately refuses self-identification as a woman (1994,\nxxxii).\n\n\nRaymond's theoretical framework regarding gender transcendence\nand a strict biological binary prior to cultural imposition guides this\ndiscussion. Given her distinction between integration and integrity,\nany mixing and matching of gender would fail to achieve the goal of\ncomplete gender transcendence, and therefore fail as a politics of\nliberation. Moreover, given that she does not allow room for a third\nspace between man and woman, given that she does not recognize trans\noppression as somewhat independent of sexist oppression, and given that\nwomen-identified-women are central to her views about resistance, it is\nhardly surprising that she should be dismayed by Jess' decision.\nAside from problems mentioned with this theory earlier, it is worth\nadding that, as Cressida Heyes notes, Raymond's theory, which\nrejects transgender resistance a priori, seems to be unfalsifiable\n(2003, 1108).\n",
