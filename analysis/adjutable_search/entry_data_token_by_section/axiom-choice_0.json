    "main_text": "Origins and Chronology of the Axiom of Choice\n1. Origins and Chronology of the Axiom of Choice\n\n\nIn 1904 Ernst Zermelo formulated the Axiom of Choice (abbreviated as\nAC throughout this article) in terms of what he called\ncoverings (Zermelo 1904).  He starts with an arbitrary set\n\\(M\\) and uses the symbol \\(M'\\) to denote an\narbitrary nonempty subset of \\(M\\), the collection of which he\ndenotes by M.  He continues:\n\n           \nImagine that with every subset \\(M'\\) there is associated\nan arbitrary element \\(m_{1}'\\), that occurs in\n\\(M'\\) itself; let \\(m_{1}'\\) be called\nthe \u201cdistinguished\u201d element of \\(M'\\). This\nyields a \u201ccovering\u201d \\(g\\) of the set \\(M\\) by\ncertain elements of the set \\(M\\). The number of these coverings\nis equal to the product [of the cardinalities of all the subsets\n\\(M'\\)] and is certainly different from 0.\n\n\n\n\nThe last sentence of this quotation\u2014which asserts, in effect,\nthat coverings always exist for the collection of nonempty subsets of\nany (nonempty) set\u2014is Zermelo\u2019s first formulation of\nthe Axiom of \n Choice[1].\n This is now usually stated in terms of choice functions:\nhere a choice function on a collection \\(\\sH\\)\n  of nonempty sets is a map \\(f\\) with domain \n \\(\\sH\\)\n  such that \\(f(X) \\in X\\) for every \\(X \\in \\sH\\). \n\nAs a very simple example, let \\(\\sH\\)\nbe the collection of nonempty subsets of \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\), i.e., \n\\(\\sH = \\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{0,1\\}\\}\\). Then \n\\(\\sH\\) has the two distinct choice functions\n\\(f_{1}\\) and \\(f_{2}\\) given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\nf_{1}(\\{0\\}) &= 0 \\\\\nf_{1}(\\{1\\}) &= 1 \\\\\nf_{1}(\\{0, 1\\}) &= 0 \\\\\nf_{2}(\\{0\\}) &= 0 \\\\\nf_{2}(\\{1\\}) &= 1 \\\\\nf_{2}(\\{0, 1\\}) &= 1\n\\end{align}\n\n\n  A more interesting example of a choice function is provided by\ntaking \\(\\sH\\)\nto be the set of (unordered) pairs of real numbers and the function\nto be that assigning to each pair its least element. A different choice\nfunction is obtained by assigning to each pair its greatest\nelement. Clearly many more choice functions on\n\\(\\sH\\) can be defined.\n\n  Stated in terms of choice functions, Zermelo\u2019s first formulation of\nAC reads:\n\nAC1: \nAny collection of nonempty sets has a choice function.\n\n\nAC1 can be reformulated in terms of indexed\nor variable sets. An indexed collection of sets\n \\(\\sA = \\{A_{i}: i \\in I\\}\\)\n may be conceived as a variable set, to wit, as a set\nvarying over the index set \\(I\\). Each\n\\(A_{i}\\) is then the \u201cvalue\u201d of the\nvariable set \\(\\sA\\)\nat stage \\(i\\). A choice function on\n\\(\\sA\\) is a map \\(f: I \\rightarrow \\bigcup_{i\\in I} A_{i}\\) such that \n\\(f(i) \\in A_{i}\\) for all \\(i\\in I\\).  A choice function on\n\\(\\sA\\) is thus a \u201cchoice\u201d of an element of the variable set\n\\(\\sA\\) at each stage; in other words, a choice function on\n\\(\\sA\\) is a variable element of \\(\\sA\\). \nAC1 is then equivalent to the assertion\n\nAC2: \n Any indexed collection of  sets has a choice function.\n\n\n\nInformally speaking, AC2 amounts to the assertion\nthat a variable set with an element at each stage has a variable\nelement.\n\nAC1 can also be reformulated in terms of\nrelations, viz.\n\nAC3: \n For any relation \\(R\\) between sets \\(A\\), \\(B\\),\n\n\\[ \n{\\forall x\\inn A}\\ \\exists y\\inn B[R(x,y)] \\Rightarrow \n \\exists f[f: A \\rightarrow B \\amp {\\forall x\\inn A}[R(x,fx)]].\n\\]\n\n\n  In other words, every relation contains a function having the same\ndomain.\n\n\nFinally AC3  is easily shown to be equivalent\n(in the usual set theories) \n to:[2]\n\nAC4: \n Any surjective function has a right inverse.\n\n\n\nIn a 1908 paper Zermelo introduced a modified form of AC. Let\nus call a transversal (or choice set) for a family\nof sets \\(\\sH\\) any subset \n\\(T \\subseteq \\bigcup \\sH\\)\n for which each intersection \\(T \\cap X\\) for\n\\(X \\in \\sH\\)\nhas exactly one element.  As a very simple example, let \n\\(\\sH = \\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2, 3\\}\\}\\). Then \n\\(\\sH\\)\nhas the two transversals \\(\\{0, 1, 2\\}\\) and \\(\\{0, 1, 3\\}\\). \nA more substantial example is afforded  by letting\n\\(\\sH\\) be the collection of all lines in the Euclidean plane parallel to the\n\\(x\\)-axis. Then the set \\(T\\) of points on the \\(y\\)-axis is a\ntransversal for \\(\\sH\\).\n\nStated in terms of transversals, then, Zermelo\u2019s second (1908)\nformulation of AC amounts to the assertion that any family of\nmutually disjoint nonempty sets has a\n transversal.[3]\n\n Zermelo asserts that \u201cthe purely objective character\u201d of\nthis principle \u201cis immediately evident.\u201d In making this\nassertion Zermelo meant to emphasize the fact that in this form the\nprinciple makes no appeal to the possibility of making\n\u201cchoices\u201d. It may also be that Zermelo had the following\n\u201ccombinatorial\u201d justification of the principle in\nmind. Given a family \\(\\sH\\) of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, call\na subset \\(S \\subseteq \\bigcup \\sH\\) a selector for \\(\\sH\\)\nif \\(S\\cap X \\ne \\varnothing\\) for all \\(X \\in \\sH\\). Clearly\nselectors for \\(\\sH\\) exist; \\(\\bigcup \\sH\\) itself is an example. Now\none can imagine taking a selector \\(S\\) for \\(\\sH\\) and\n\u201cthinning out\u201d each intersection \\(S \\cap X\\) for \\(X\\in\n\\sH\\) until it contains just a single element. The result is a\ntransversal for \\(\\sH\\). This argument, suitably refined, yields a\nprecise derivation of\nAC in this formulation from the set-theoretical\nprinciple known as Zorn\u2019s lemma (see below). \n\n Let us call Zermelo\u2019s 1908 formulation the combinatorial\n axiom of choice: \n\nCAC: \n Any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a\ntransversal.\n\n\n It is to be noted that AC1 and CAC\nfor finite collections of sets are both provable (by\ninduction) in the usual set theories. But in the case of an\ninfinite collection, even when each of its members is finite,\nthe question of the existence of a choice function or a transversal is\n problematic[4].\n For example, as already mentioned, it is easy to come up with a\nchoice function for the collection of pairs of real numbers (simply\nchoose the smaller element of each pair). But it is by no means\nobvious how to produce a choice function for the collection of pairs\nof arbitrary sets of real numbers.\n\n Zermelo\u2019s original purpose in introducing AC was to\nestablish a central principle of Cantor\u2019s set theory, namely, that\nevery set admits a well-ordering and so can also be assigned a\ncardinal number. Zermelo\u2019s 1904 introduction of the axiom, as well as\nthe use to which he put it, provoked considerable criticism from the\nmathematicians of the day.  The chief objection raised was to what\nsome saw as its highly non-constructive, even idealist, character:\nwhile the axiom asserts the possibility of making a number \nof\u2014perhaps even an uncountable number\u2014of arbitrary\n\u201cchoices\u201d, it gives no indication whatsoever of how these\nlatter are actually to be effected, of how, otherwise put, choice\nfunctions are to be defined. This was particularly\nobjectionable to mathematicians of a \u201cconstructive\u201d bent\nsuch as the so-called French Empiricists Baire, Borel and Lebesgue,\nfor whom a mathematical object could be asserted to exist only if it\ncan be defined in such a way as to characterize it uniquely.\nZermelo\u2019s response to his critics came in the form in two papers in\n1908. In the first of these, as remarked above, he\nreformulated AC in terms of transversals; in the second\n(1908a) he made explicit the further assumptions needed to carry\nthrough his proof of the well-ordering theorem. These assumptions\nconstituted the first explicit presentation of an axiom system for set\ntheory.\n\n As the debate concerning the Axiom of Choice rumbled on, it became\napparent that the proofs of a number of significant mathematical\ntheorems made essential use of it, thereby leading many mathematicians\nto treat it as an indispensable tool of their trade.  Hilbert, for\nexample, came to regard AC as an essential principle of\nmathematics[5] and\nemployed it in his defence of classical mathematical reasoning against\nthe attacks of the intuitionists.  Indeed his \u03b5-operators are\nessentially just choice functions (see the entry on the\n  epsilon calculus).\n\n Although the usefulness of AC quickly become clear,\ndoubts about its soundness remained. These doubts were reinforced by\nthe fact that it had certain strikingly counterintuitive\nconsequences.  The most spectacular of these was Banach\nand Tarski\u2019s paradoxical decompositions of the sphere\n(Banach and Tarski 1924): any solid sphere can be split into finitely\nmany pieces which can be reassembled to form two solid spheres of the\nsame size; and any solid sphere can be split into finitely many\npieces in such a way as to enable them to be reassembled to form a\nsolid sphere of arbitrary size. (See Wagon 1993.) \n\n It was not until the middle 1930s that the question of the soundness\nof AC was finally put to rest with Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s\nproof of its consistency relative to the other axioms of set theory.\n\n\n Here is a brief chronology of\n AC:[6]\n\n\n1904/1908\nZermelo introduces axioms of set theory, explicitly formulates AC \nand uses it to prove the well-ordering theorem,\nthereby raising a storm of controversy.\n\n\n1904\nRussell recognizes AC as the multiplicative\naxiom: the product of arbitrary nonzero cardinal numbers is\nnonzero.\n\n\n1914\nHausdorff derives from AC the existence of\nnonmeasurable sets in the \u201cparadoxical\u201d\nform that \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) of a sphere is congruent to \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\) of it\n(Hausdorff 1914).\n\n\n1922\nFraenkel introduces the \u201cpermutation method\u201d to\nestablish independence of AC from a system of set\ntheory with atoms (Fraenkel 1922).\n\n\n1924\nBuilding on the work of Hausdorff, Banach and Tarski derive from\nAC their paradoxical decompositions of the sphere.\n\n\n1926\nHilbert introduces into his proof theory the\n\u201ctransfinite\u201d or \u201cepsilon\u201d axiom as a version\nof AC . (Hilbert 1926).\n\n\n1936\nLindenbaum and Mostowski extend and refine Fraenkel\u2019s permutation\nmethod, and prove the independence of various statements of set theory\nweaker than AC . (Lindenbaum and Tarski 1938) \n\n\n1935\u201338\nG\u00f6del establishes relative consistency of\n AC with the\n axioms of set theory (G\u00f6del 1938a, 1938b, 1939, 1940). \n\n\n1950s\nMendelson, Shoenfield and Specker, working independently, use the\npermutation method to establish the independence of various forms of AC \nfrom a system of set theory without atoms, but\nalso lacking the axiom of foundation (Mendelson 1956, 1958,\nShoenfield 1955, Specker 1957).\n\n\n1963\nPaul Cohen proves independence of AC from the standard\naxioms of set theory (Cohen 1963, 1964).\n\n\n",
