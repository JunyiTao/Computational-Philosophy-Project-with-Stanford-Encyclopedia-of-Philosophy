    "main_text": "Legalism (Fajia)\n6. Chinese Buddhist Ethics\n\nBuddhism is not indigenous to China, and it has a long and rich\ntradition of thought and practice in India and in areas other than\nChina. This brief section will focus on ethical aspects of the most\ndistinctive form of Buddhism that developed once it was introduced to\nChina: Chan Buddhism, or as it came to be known later in Japan, Zen.\nIt should be noted, however, that prominent forms of Chinese Buddhism\nalso include Tiantai and Huayan. All three forms of Chinese Buddhism\ndeveloped in interaction with indigenous Chinese thought, especially\nDaoism. Chan developed partly as a response to the perception of some\nChinese Buddhists that Tiantai and Huayan had developed in overly\nscholastic directions with proliferating metaphysical distinctions and\ndoctrines that hinder rather than aid Enlightenment.\n\nThe immediate focus of Buddhist ethics is the problem of suffering,\nand a conception of the self is at the heart of the Buddhist response\nto that problem. The self is conceived as a floating collection of\nvarious psychophysical reactions and responses with no fixed center or\nunchanging ego entity. The usual human conception of self as a fixed\nand unchanging center is a delusion. Our bodily attributes, various\nfeelings, perceptions, ideas, wishes, dreams, and in general a\nconsciousness of the world display a constant interplay and\ninterconnection that leads us to the belief that there is some\ndefinite \u2018I\u2019 that underlies and is independent of the\never-shifting series. But there is only the interacting and\ninterconnected series. Human suffering ultimately stems from a concern\nfor the existence and pleasures and pains of the kind of self that\nnever existed in the first place. Recognition of the impermanence of\nthe self can lead to release or mitigation of suffering, but the\nrecognition cannot merely be intellectual. It must involve\ntransformation of one\u2019s desires. The belief on some abstract\nlevel, for example, that there are no permanent selves is a belief\nthat can co-exist with having and acting on intense desires to avoid\ndeath, as if death were some evil befalling some underlying\n\u2018I\u2019. Similarly, the intellectual recognition that none of\nthe \u201dthings\u201c of ordinary life are fixed and separate\nentities, anymore than the self is, can lead to recognition of all of\nlife as an interdependent whole and to the practical attitude of\ncompassion for all of life. But if the latter recognition is again\nmerely intellectual, one can still have and act on intensely\nself-regarding desires at severe cost to others. In both cases a\ntransformation of desire is what is required in order to go beyond the\nmerely intellectual and to achieve true Enlightenment and meaningful\nrecognition of one\u2019s true nature as impermanent and as\ninterdependent with all other things.\n\nRecall the practical focus and the closeness to pre-theoretical\nexperience that are distinctive of indigenous Chinese philosophy.\nThese traits interacted with Buddhism as it was introduced into China.\nThe \u2018Chan\u2019 in \u201dChan Buddhism\u201c comes from the\nSanskrit \u2018dhyana\u2019 which means meditation. Though\nmeditation practice is not the only practice employed in Chan, its\ncentral role does illustrate the focus on achieving transformation of\none\u2019s desires through experience of the self and the world. This\nkind of transformation is different than reaching intellectual\nconviction through textual study and understanding of argumentation,\nand also different than escape from the world of suffering through\nobliteration of one\u2019s consciousness as an individual being.\nChinese Buddhism in the form of Chan was especially influential in\nputting forward this conception of Enlightenment as lived in this\nworld rather than escaping from it.\n\nDaoism in particular has themes that make it especially appropriate\nfor interaction with Buddhism. Recall the theme that one must keep\ndesires from interfering with one\u2019s attention to the matter at\nhand. Correspondingly, a major theme in Chan is that all forms of\nstriving, especially the very striving for Enlightenment, interfere\nwith attention to one\u2019s true nature (Hui Neng, 638\u2013713,\nPlatform Scripture). Hence the reason for the otherwise\npuzzlingly harsh reactions of Chan masters to the earnest strivings of\ntheir students to reach Enlightenment (Yi Xuan, d. 866, The\nRecorded Conversations of Linji Yi Xuan) especially if such\nstrivings have any tinge of the academic or doctrinal about them\n(Huang Po, d. 850, The Transmission of Mind). Recall also the\ntheme in Daodejing concerning the dao as the source\nof the myriad things. The Buddha\u2019s insight into the nature of\nthe many things brought him to recognize the Many as also the One.\nFinally, recall the skeptical theme in Daoism about the limits of\nconceptualization. The Buddha\u2019s insight into the Many as also\nthe One does not mean that the Many are really only One, but rather\nMany and Once at once, and if we have difficulty making sense of that,\nit is founded in the limits of our conceptualization. Finally, there\nis the same possibility for ambiguity as to whether there is some\nineffable and nonconceptual access to an ultimate reality or whether\nthere is skeptical question that goes all the way down (or all the way\nup?). In the Zhuangzi this ambiguity is quite apparent. And\nthough Chan is usually taken to affirm a foundation in ineffable\naccess (Kasulis, 1986), there are those who argue that a thoroughgoing\nskepticism is truer to its spirit (Wright, 1998).\n\nSince the self is a bundle of changing psychological and physical\nattributes whose boundaries are conventionally established, and since\nits attributes exist only in relation to other things outside its\nconventionally established boundaries, it ought to dampen its\nself-regarding cares and concerns and widen the boundaries of its\nconcerns to embrace all life. This Buddhist reasoning certainly is an\ninteresting way to ground impersonal concern, and it may appeal to\nthose of us who see little plausibility in the idea of Cartesian\nsubstances as fixed ego entities. On the other hand, it\u2019s not clear\nthat a metaphysical deconstruction of an essential self assures that\ncare for all others is normatively required. Further, this reasoning\nmay seem to drain all passion from life, and it requires that we\ndampen the attachment we have not only to our selves but also to\nparticular others such as friends and family members. Buddhism is\nespecially well known for its advocacy of detachment, not only from\nmaterial possessions, worldly power and status, but also from\nparticular people and communities. For example, in Ashvaghosha\u2019s\npoem on \u201dNanda the Fair,\u201c the Buddha explains to Nanda\nthat delusion alone ties one person to another (Conze, 1959, 110). The\nargument is that a family is like a group of travelers at an inn who\ncome together for a while and then part. No one belongs to anyone\nelse. A family is held together only as sand is held in a clenched\nfist. A number of Neo-Confucians, such as the Cheng brothers and Zhu\nXi, harshly accused Buddhists of selfishness while not quite squaring\nthat accusation with the ideal of the Boddhisattvas in Mahayana\nBuddhism, who delay their entrance into Nirvana, their final release\nfrom suffering, until all beings are liberated from suffering. What\nthe neo-Confucians might have been saying is that the real appeal of\nBuddhism is to the selfish impulse to save oneself, regardless of what\ntheir doctrines say. \n\nBuddhist traditions are diverse, long-lived, and philosophically\nsophisticated in addressing these questions. Worries about the\ndesirability and realistic possibility of assuming the kind of\ndetached attitude the Buddhists upheld are similar to worries\nraised by Daoist identification with the cosmos. As the discussion of\nZhuangzi and wife suggests, it may be possible to distinguish as an\nalternative to the pure and complete detachment exemplified in\nAshvagosha another kind that is consistent with emotional involvement\nwith others for as long as they are given to us.\n",
