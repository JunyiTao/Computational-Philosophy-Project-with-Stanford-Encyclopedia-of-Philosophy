    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n10. Moral Philosophy\n\nCook Wilson hardly wrote on topics outside the theory of knowledge and\nlogic, but two remarks ought to be made concerning moral philosophy.\nFirst, the last piece included in Statement and Inference is\ncomposed of notes for an address to a discussion society in 1897, that\nwas announced as \u2018The Ontological Proof for God\u2019s\nExistence\u2019. In this text, which opens with a discussion of\nHutcheson and Butler, Cook Wilson argued that in the case of\n\u201cemotions as are proper to the moral consciousness\u201d, such\nas the feeling of gratitude:\n\nWe cannot separate the judgement from the act as something in itself\nspeculative and in itself without the emotion. We cannot judge here\nexcept emotionally. This is true also of all moral and aesthetic\njudgements. Reason in them can only manifest itself emotionally. (SI,\n860)\n\n\nHe argued further, in what amounts to a form of moral realism, that\nthere must be a real experience, i.e., in the case of gratitude,\n\u201cGoodwill of a person, then, must here be a real\nexperience\u201d (SI, 861), and that the feeling of \u201creverence\nwith its solemnity and awe\u201d is in itself \u201cnot fear, love,\nadmiration, respect, but something quite sui generis\u201d\n(SI, 861). It is a feeling that, Cook Wilson argued, \u201cseems\ndirected to one spirit and one alone, and only possible for spirit\nconceived as God\u201d (SI, 864). In other words, the existence of\nthe feeling of reverence presupposes that God exists. Cook Wilson thus\nsketched within the span of a few pages a theory of emotions, which is\nechoed today in the moral realism that has been developed, possibly\nwithout knowledge of it, in the wake of David Wiggins\u2019\n\u2018Truth, Invention and the Meaning of Life\u2019 (Wiggins 1976)\nand a series of influential papers by John McDowell\u2014now\ncollected in McDowell (2001).\n\nCook Wilson\u2019s ideas had a limited impact on Oxford theology.\nAcknowledging his debt, the theologian and philosopher C. C. J. Webb\ndescribed religious experience as one that \u201ccannot be adequately\naccounted for except as apprehension of a real object\u201d (Webb\n1945, 38), but he nevertheless chose to describe his standpoint as a\nform of \u2018Platonic idealism\u2019 (Webb 1945, 35). Cook\nWilson\u2019s realism also formed part of the philosophical\nbackground to C. S. Lewis\u2019 \u201cnew look\u201d in the 1920s,\nvia E. F. Carritt\u2019s teaching. In Surprised by Joy,\nLewis also described awe as \u201ca commerce with something\nwhich [\u2026] proclaims itself sheerly objective\u201d (Lewis\n1955, 221), but he quickly moved away from this position (see Lewis\n(1955, chaps. XIII\u2013XIV) and McGrath (2014, chap. 2)).\n\nSecondly, Prichard is also responsible for an extension of Cook\nWilson\u2019s conception of knowledge to moral philosophy, with his\npaper \u2018Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?\u2019 (Prichard\n1912), whose main argument is analogous to Cook Wilson\u2019s\nargument for the impossibility of defining knowledge. In a nutshell,\nduty is sui generis and not definable in terms of anything\nelse. The parallel is explicit in Prichard (1912, 21 &\n35\u201336). That we ought to do certain things, we are told, arises\n\u201cin our unreflective consciousness, being an activity of moral\nthinking occasioned by the various situations in which we find\nourselves\u201d, and the demand that it is proved that we ought to do\nthese things is \u201cillegitimate\u201d (Prichard 1912, 36). In\norder to find out our duty, \u201cthe only remedy lies in actually\ngetting into a situation which occasions the obligation\u201d and\n\u201cthen letting our moral capacities of thinking do their\nwork\u201d (Prichard 1912, 37). This paper became so influential that\nPrichard was elected in 1928 to the White\u2019s Chair of Moral\nPhilosophy at Corpus Christi, although his primary domain of\ncompetence had been the theory of knowledge. His papers in moral\nphilosophy were edited after his death as Prichard (1949, now 2002).\nPrichard stands at the origin of the school of \u2018moral\u2019 or\n\u2018Oxford intuitionism\u2019, of which another pupil of Cook\nWilson, the Aristotle scholar W. D. Ross (Ross 1930, 1939) remains the\nforemost representative, along with H. W. B. Joseph, E. F. Carritt,\nand J. Laird. Some of the views they expressed have recently gained\nnew currency within \u2018moral particularism\u2019, e.g., in the\nwritings of Jonathan Dancy (Dancy 1993, 2004).\n",
