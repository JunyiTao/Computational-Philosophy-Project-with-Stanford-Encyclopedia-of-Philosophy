    "main_text": "Responses to the Hole Argument || Accept the indeterminacy\n9.2 Accept the indeterminacy\n\nAn alternative response to the hole argument is to accept that\ngenerally covariant theories of space and time such as general\nrelativity are indeterministic. Perhaps (the thought goes) this\nindeterminism is not troubling, because it is an indeterminism only\nabout which objects instantiate which properties and not about which\npatterns of properties are instantiated. It is not obvious, however,\nthat this is sufficient to defuse worries about indeterminism: at the\nvery least, if another response to the argument were available, they\nwould seem to be preferable.\n\nA related response here is to redefine determinism, and to\nargue that, in the relevant sense, theories such as general relativity\nare deterministic after all, in spite of the hole argument.\nModifications to the definition of determinism in light of the hole\nargument have been explored by Belot (1995b), Brighouse (1994, 2020),\nButterfield (1989), Melia (1999), and Pooley (2021).\n",
