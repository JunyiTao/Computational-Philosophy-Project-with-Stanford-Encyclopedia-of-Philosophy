In the case of both notions, the\nexperience of the sublime consists in a feeling of the superiority of\nour own power of reason, as a supersensible faculty, over nature\n(\u00a728, 261).\n\nIn the case of the mathematically sublime, the feeling of\nreason\u2019s superiority over nature takes the form, more\nspecifically, of a feeling of reason\u2019s superiority to\nimagination, conceived of as the natural capacity required for sensory\napprehension, including the apprehension of the magnitudes of\nempirically given things. We have this feeling when we are confronted\nwith something that is so large that it overwhelms imagination\u2019s\ncapacity to comprehend it. In such a situation imagination strives to\ncomprehend the object in accordance with a demand of reason, but fails\nto do so.\n\n\nJust because there is in our imagination a striving to advance to the\ninfinite, while in our reason there lies a claim to absolute totality,\nas to a real idea, the very inadequacy of our faculty for estimating\nthe magnitude of the things in the sensible world [viz., imagination]\nawakens the feeling of a supersensible faculty in us. (\u00a725,\n250)\n\n\nThe fact that we are capable, through reason, of thinking infinity as\na whole, \u201cindicates a faculty of the mind which surpasses every\nstandard of sense\u201d (\u00a726, 254). While Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of the mathematically sublime mentions the Pyramids in\nEgypt and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome (\u00a726, 252), it is\nnot clear that these are intended as examples of the sublime; and Kant\nclaims explicitly that the most appropriate examples are of things in\nnature. More specifically, they must be natural things the concept of\nwhich does not involve the idea of a purpose (\u00a726,\n252\u2013253): this rules out animals, the concept of which is\nconnected with the idea of biological function, but it apparently\nincludes mountains and the sea (\u00a726, 256).\n\nIn the case of the dynamically sublime, the feeling of reason\u2019s\nsuperiority to nature is more direct than in the mathematical case.\nKant says that we consider nature as \u201cdynamically sublime\u201d\nwhen we consider it as \u201ca power that has no dominion over\nus\u201d (\u00a728, 260). We have the feeling of the dynamically\nsublime when we experience nature as fearful while knowing ourselves\nto be in a position of safety and hence without in fact being afraid.\nIn this situation\n\n\nthe irresistibility of [nature\u2019s] power certainly makes us,\nconsidered as natural beings, recognize our physical powerlessness,\nbut at the same time it reveals a capacity for judging ourselves as\nindependent of nature and a superiority over nature\u2026whereby the\nhumanity in our person remains undemeaned even though the human being\nmust submit to that dominion. (\u00a728, 261\u2013262)\n\n\nKant\u2019s examples include overhanging cliffs, thunder clouds,\nvolcanoes and hurricanes (\u00a728, 261).\n\nThe feeling associated with the sublime is a feeling of pleasure in\nthe superiority of our reason over nature, but it also involves\ndispleasure. In the case of the mathematically sublime, the\ndispleasure comes from the awareness of the inadequacy of our\nimagination; in the dynamical case it comes from the awareness of our\nphysical powerlessness in the face of nature\u2019s might. Kant is\nnot consistent in his descriptions of how the pleasure and the\ndispleasure are related, but one characterization describes them as\nalternating: the \u201cmovement of the mind\u201d in the\nrepresentation of the sublime\n\n\nmay be compared to a vibration, i.e., to a rapidly alternating\nrepulsion from and attraction to one and the same object. (\u00a727,\n258)\n\n\nKant also describes the feeling of the sublime as a \u201cpleasure\nwhich is possible only by means of a displeasure\u201d (\u00a727,\n260) and as a \u201cnegative liking\u201d (General Remark following\n\u00a729, 269). He also appears to identify it with the feeling of\nrespect, which in his practical philosophy is associated with\nrecognition of the moral law (\u00a727, 257).\n\nJudgments of the sublime are like judgments of beauty in being based\non feeling, more specifically on pleasure or liking. They are also\nlike judgments of beauty in claiming the universal validity of the\npleasure, where that claim is understood as involving necessity\n(everyone who perceives the object ought to share the feeling)\n(\u00a729, 266). But as we have seen, the pleasure is different in\nthat it involves a negative element. The following differences should\nalso be noted:\n\n(particularly emphasized by Kant) In making a judgment of the\nsublime, we regard the object as \u201ccontrapurposive\u201d, rather\nthan purposive, for the faculties of imagination and judgment\n(\u00a723, 245). While judgments of the sublime do involve the\nrepresentation of purposiveness, the purposiveness differs from that\ninvolved in a judgment of beauty in two ways.\n\n\nIt is not the object, but the aesthetic judgment itself which is\nrepresented as purposive.\nThe aesthetic judgment is represented as purposive not for\nimagination or judgment, but for reason (\u00a727, 260) or for the\n\u201cwhole vocation of the mind\u201d (\u00a727, 259).\n \nThe claim to universal validity made by a judgment of the sublime\nrests, not on the universal validity of the conditions of cognition,\nbut rather on the universal validity of moral feeling (\u00a729,\n255\u2013256).\nWhile we can correctly call objects beautiful, we cannot properly\ncall them sublime (\u00a723, 245); sublimity strictly speaking\n\u201cis not contained in anything in nature, but only in our\nmind\u201d (\u00a728, 264). This means, according to Kant, that there\nis no need for a deduction of the sublime.\nWhile judgments of beauty involve a relation between the faculties\nof imagination and understanding, the faculties brought into relation\nin a judgment of the sublime are imagination and reason (\u00a729,\n266).\n\n\nThe importance of the sublime within Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory is\na matter of dispute. In the Introductions to the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant has a great deal to say about the beautiful, but\nmentions the sublime only fleetingly (FI XII, 249\u2013250) and in\nthe Analytic of the Sublime itself he notes that\n\n\nthe concept of the sublime in nature is far from being as important\nand rich in consequences as that of its beauty\n\n\nand that the\n\n\ntheory of the sublime is a mere appendix to the aesthetic judging of\nthe purposiveness of nature. (\u00a723, 246)\n\n\nKant\u2019s views about the sublime also appear to be less\nhistorically distinctive than his views about the beautiful, showing\nin particular the influence of Burke. On the other hand, Kant\u2019s\naccount of the sublime has been influential in literary theory (see\n Section 2.9\n below), and the sublime also plays a significant role in Kant\u2019s\naccount of the connection between aesthetic judgment and morality.\nCommentators who have emphasized the importance of the sublime in\nconnection with moral feeling include Clewis (2009) and Matherne\n(forthcoming); the latter explores in particular the experience of the\nsublime as enabling the perception of our own freedom.\n\nOne focus of debate regarding the sublime concerns whether sublimity,\naccording to Kant, is restricted to objects of nature, or whether\nthere can also be sublime art; Abaci (2008) defends Kant\u2019s\nrestriction of sublimity to nature; Clewis (2010) defends the opposite\nview. For discussion of the Kantian sublime as it might apply to\nspecific works of art, see chs. 6 and 7 of Lyotard 1988 [1991] (on\nBarnett Newman\u2019s paintings as an instance of the Kantian\nsublime) and Myskja 2002 (which brings Kant\u2019s notion of the\nsublime to bear on Samuel Beckett\u2019s novel Molloy).\nZuckert 2021 offers a clear and helpful discussion of Lyotard\u2019s\nview of Kant\u2019s account of the sublime in application to art.\n\nAn orthogonal question concerns the proper object of a judgment of the\nsublime (whether of nature or art). We might suppose that it is the\nphysical object occasioning the feeling of the sublime, for example\nSt. Peter\u2019s in Rome, or an erupting volcano. But, as we saw\nabove, Kant says that sublimity does not belong to objects but is\n\u201conly in our mind\u201d (\u00a728, 264). Commentators have\nsuggested various candidates for what is properly called sublime,\nincluding rational ideas, human reason, and the feeling of pleasure\nwhich constitutes our experience of the sublime; for discussion, see\nMoore (2018).\n\nA good overview of Kant\u2019s theory of the sublime and its\nconnection with Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory more generally is\nprovided in Crowther 1989; other useful expositions include Guyer\n(1993: ch. 7), Matthews (1996), Budd (1998), and Allison (2001: ch.\n13). The more recent overview in Merritt 2018 offers a helpful account\nof the historical sources of Kant\u2019s theory, including\nStoicism..\n",
