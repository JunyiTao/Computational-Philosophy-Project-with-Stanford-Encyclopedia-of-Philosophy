Empirical Research\n\nThe explanatory strategies and theoretical toolkit of the cognitive\nsciences have been used to guide and account for an enormous range of\nempirical work. Cognitive-evolutionary approaches to normative\npsychology are likewise interdisciplinary, and aspire to\naccommodate empirical research done on norms by anthropologists,\nsociologists, behavioral economists, and developmental, comparative,\nand other kinds of psychologists. This section provides a sampling of\nthe sorts of findings that have been marshalled to illuminate\ninteresting aspects of norm-guided behavior and support different\nclaims about normative cognition.\n",
