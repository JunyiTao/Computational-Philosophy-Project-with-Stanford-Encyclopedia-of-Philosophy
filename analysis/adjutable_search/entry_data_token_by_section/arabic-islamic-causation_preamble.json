    "main_text": "\n\nIn the classical period of Arabic and Islamic thought\n(9th\u201312th centuries), original and\ninfluential accounts of causation emerged from debate within two\nintellectual traditions: speculative theology (kal\u0101m)\nand Greek philosophy (falsafah). Among the theologians\n(mutakallim\u016bn), dispute about the distribution of agency\nand causal power played a role in the interpretation of revealed\naccounts of God and his relationship to the world. By contrast, the\nphilosophers (fal\u0101sifah) saw themselves as developing a\nrationalist science begun by Aristotle. In this tradition, to know a\nthing is to know its causes. Discovery of the nature of causation is\nregarded as fundamental to science.\n\nIn the classical period, at least, theology and philosophy developed\nseparately. Indeed, philosophy\u2019s independence from theology in\nthis period is striking as compared to its subordinate status as the\nhandmaid of theology in the Medieval Latin West. Nevertheless, debate\nacross theology and philosophy contributed to the development of both\ntraditions.\n",
