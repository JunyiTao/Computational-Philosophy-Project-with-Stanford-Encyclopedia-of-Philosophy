    "main_text": "Theoretical Options for Natural Law Theorists || Natural goodness\n2.1 Natural goodness\n\nIt is essential to the natural law position that there be some things\nthat are universally and naturally good. But how is universal, natural\ngoodness possible?\u00a0 Given the variability of human tastes and\ndesires, how could there be such universal goods?\n\nNatural law theorists have at least three answers available to them.\nThe first answer is Hobbesian, and proceeds on the basis of a\nsubjectivist theory of the good. On subjectivist theories of the good,\nwhat makes it true that something is good is that it is desired, or\nliked, or in some way is the object of one\u2019s pro-attitudes, or\nwould be the object of one\u2019s pro-attitudes in some suitable\nconditions. One might think that to affirm a subjectivist theory of\nthe good is to reject natural law theory, given the immense variation\nin human desire. But this is not so. For one might hold that human\nbeings\u2019 common nature, their similarity in physiological\nconstitution, makes them such as to have some desires in common, and\nthese desires may be so central to human aims and purposes that we can\nbuild important and correct precepts of rationality around them. This\nis in fact what Hobbes claims. For while on the Hobbesian view what is\ngood is what is desired, Hobbes thinks that humans are similarly\nconstructed so that for each human (when he or she is properly\nbiologically functioning) his or her central aim is the avoidance of\nviolent death. Thus Hobbes is able to build his entire natural law\ntheory around a single good, the good of self-preservation, which is\nso important to human life that exceptionlessly binding precepts can\nbe formulated with reference to its achievement.\n\nThe second answer is Aristotelian. The idea here is to reject a\nsubjectivism about the good, holding that what makes it true that\nsomething is good is not that it stands in some relation to desire but\nrather that it is somehow perfective or completing\nof a being, where what is perfective or completing of a being depends\non that being\u2019s nature. So what is good for an oak is what is\ncompleting or perfective of the oak, and this depends on the kind of\nthing that an oak is by nature; and what is good for a dog is what is\ncompleting or perfective of the dog, and this depends on the kind of\nthing that a dog is by nature; and what is good for a human depends on\nwhat is completing or perfective of a human, and this depends on the\nkind of thing a human is by nature. So the fact of variability of\ndesire is not on its own enough to cast doubt on the natural law\nuniversal goods thesis: as the good is not defined fundamentally by\nreference to desire, the fact of variation in desire is not enough to\nraise questions about universal goods. This is the view affirmed by\nAquinas, and the majority of adherents to the natural law\ntradition.\n\nThe third answer is Platonic. Like the Aristotelian view, it rejects a\nsubjectivism about the good. But it does not hold that the good is to\nbe understood in terms of human nature. The role of human nature is\nnot to define or set the good, but merely to define what the\npossibilities of human achievement are. So one might think that some\nthings \u2014 knowledge, beauty, etc. \u2014 are just good in\nthemselves, apart from any reference to human desire or perfection,\nbut hold that the pursuit of these are only part of the natural law\ninsofar as they fall within the ambit of human practical possibility.\nThis view of the good is not much defended \u2014 in part because of\nthe scathing criticism offered of Plato\u2019s view by Aristotle in\nthe Nicomachean Ethics (NE I, 6) \u2014 but it was affirmed\nby Iris Murdoch (1970), and forms part of the natural law view\ndefended by Michael Moore (1982).\n\nNone of these answers is without difficulties. While there are\ncontemporary defenders of Hobbesian moral theories (see Gauthier\n1986), there is no one who is on record defending Hobbes\u2019s\ninteresting combination of a thoroughgoing subjectivism about the good\nalong with an account of a dominant substantive good around which the\nmoral rules are formulated. The basic reason for this just seems to be\nthat Hobbes\u2019s arguments that the human desire for\nself-preservation is such an entirely dominant desire are implausible,\nand there do not seem to be any better arguments available. The\nPlatonic version of the view has struck many as both too\nmetaphysically ornate to be defensible, on one hand, and as not\nfitting very well with a conception of ethics grounded in nature, on\nthe other. While the Aristotelian version of the view has also been\ncharged with some of the metaphysical excesses that the Platonist view\nallegedly countenances, most contemporary natural law theory is\nAristotelian in its orientation, holding that there is still good\nreason to hold to an understanding of flourishing in nature and that\nnone of the advances of modern science has called this part of the\nAristotelian view into question. (For defenses of such Aristotelian\naccounts of the good, see Foot 2001, Thompson 1995, and Thompson\n2004.) \n",
