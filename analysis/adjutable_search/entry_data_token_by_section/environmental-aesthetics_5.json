This revival was the result of several\ndifferent factors. In part, it was a response to the growing public\nconcern about the apparent degeneration of the environment, aesthetic\nand otherwise. It was also the result of the academic world becoming\naware of the significance of the environmental movement\u2014at the\nlevel of both theoretical discussion and practical action. It is\nnoteworthy that the emergence of the philosophical study of\nenvironmental ethics also dates from this time. Some of the earlier\nwork in environmental aesthetics focused on empirical research\nconducted in response to public apprehension about the aesthetic state\nof the environment. Critics of this research argued that the landscape\nassessment and planning techniques used in environmental management\nwere inadequate in stressing mainly formal properties, while\noverlooking expressive and other kinds of aesthetic qualities (Sagoff\n1974, Carlson 1976). Empirical approaches were also faulted as fixated\non \u201cscenic beauty\u201d and overly influenced by ideas such as\nthat of the picturesque (Carlson 1977). In general, the area was\nthought to be beset by theoretical problems (Sparshott 1972), and the\nempirical research in particular was said to lack an adequate\nconceptual framework, often being conducted in what one critic called\na \u201ctheoretical vacuum\u201d (Appleton 1975b). Attempts to fill\nthis vacuum prompted the idea of sociobiological underpinnings for the\naesthetic appreciation of nature, such as \u201cprospect-refuge\ntheory\u201d (Appleton 1975a 1982), as well as other kinds of\nevolution-related accounts (Orians and Heerwagen 1986 1992), the idea\nof which has recently received more attention from some philosophers\n(Davies 2012, Paden et al 2012, Paden 2015a 2016, Bartalesi\nand Portera 2015). In addition, the concerns of this period motivated\nthe development of a variety of theoretical models of aesthetic\nresponse grounded in, for example, developmental and environmental\npsychology (Kaplan and Kaplan 1989, Bourassa 1991). There are\noverviews (Zube 1984, Cats-Baril and Gibson 1986, Daniel 2001) and\ncollections (Saarinen et al 1984, Nasar 1988, Sheppard and\nHarshaw 2001) of this and related kinds of research, as well as more\nrecent studies that, although they are essentially empirical in\norientation, are of considerable theoretical interest (Porteous 1996,\nBell 1999, Parsons and Daniel 2002, Gobster et al 2007, Hill\nand Daniel 2008, Gobster 2008 2013). One comprehensive review of this\nkind of research also includes some discussion of its relationship to\nphilosophical work in environmental aesthetics (Thompson and Tarvlou\n2009).\n\nWithin philosophical aesthetics itself, the renewed interest in the\naesthetics of nature was also fueled by another development: the\npublication of Ronald Hepburn\u2019s seminal article\n\u201cContemporary Aesthetics and the Neglect of Natural\nBeauty\u201d (Hepburn 1966). Hepburn\u2019s essay is commonly\nrecognized as setting the agenda for the aesthetics of nature for the\nlate twentieth century (Brook 2010, Saito 2010, Sep\u00e4nmaa 2010,\nCarlson 2014b). After noting that by essentially reducing all of\naesthetics to philosophy of art, analytic aesthetics had virtually\nignored the natural world, Hepburn argued that aesthetic appreciation\nof art frequently provides misleading models for the appreciation of\nnature. However, he nonetheless observed that there is in the\naesthetic appreciation of nature, as in the appreciation of art, a\ndistinction between appreciation that is only trivial and superficial\nand that which is serious and deep. He furthermore suggested that for\nnature such serious appreciation might require new and different\napproaches that can accommodate not only nature\u2019s indeterminate\nand varying character, but also both our multi-sensory experience and\nour diverse understanding of it. By focusing attention on natural\nbeauty, Hepburn demonstrated that there could be significant\nphilosophical investigation of the aesthetic experience of the world\nbeyond the artworld. He thereby not only generated renewed interest in\nthe aesthetics of nature, he also laid foundations for environmental\naesthetics in general as well as for the aesthetics of everyday\nlife.\n\nIn the wake of Hepburn\u2019s article, the next major developments in\nthe emerging field of environmental aesthetics challenged both the\nidea that nature appreciation is not aesthetic and the persistence of\nart-oriented approaches to the aesthetic appreciation of nature.\nAlthough these views about the appreciation of nature had found some\ngrounding in analytic aesthetics\u2019 reduction of aesthetics to\nphilosophy of art, as art\u2019s monopoly on philosophical aesthetics\nbegan to weaken, they were increasing recognized to be deeply\ncounterintuitive. Concerning the former, many of our fundamental\nparadigms of aesthetic experience seem to be instances of appreciation\nof nature, such as our delight in a sunset or in a bird in flight.\nMoreover, the Western tradition in aesthetics, as well as other\ntraditions, such as the Japanese, has long been committed to doctrines\nthat explicitly contradict the nonaesthetic conception of nature\nappreciation, such as the conviction that, as one philosopher\nexpressed it, anything that can be viewed can be viewed aesthetically\n(Ziff 1979). Concerning the art-oriented models, it was argued by some\nthat such approaches do not fully realize serious, appropriate\nappreciation of nature, but rather distort the true character of\nnatural environments. For example, the landscape model recommends\nframing and flattening environments into scenery. Moreover, in\nfocusing heavily on artistic qualities, these accounts are thought to\nneglect much of our normal experience and understanding of nature\n(Hepburn 1966 1993, Carlson 1979 2000, Berleant 1985 1988 1992, Saito\n1998a 1998b). The problem, in short, is that they do not acknowledge\nthe importance of aesthetically appreciating nature, as one\naesthetician puts it, \u201cas nature\u201d (Budd 2002).\n",
