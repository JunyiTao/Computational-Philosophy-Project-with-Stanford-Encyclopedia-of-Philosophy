    "main_text": "Influence || On Renaissance and Early Modern Philosophy\n5.4 On Contemporary Philosophy\n\nWhile Stoic texts were not widely read or readily accessible in the\n19th and early 20th centuries, some of their views were presented in\nanthologies and historical surveys, such as Prantl\u2019s 1855\nHistory of Western Logic, the first volume of which contains\na lengthy chapter on Stoic logic. A recent study by S. Bobzien (2021)\nhas suggested that the latter might have found its way to Gottlob\nFrege, the 20th century philosopher credited by many with founding\nanalytic philosophy. In this work, Bobzien produces evidence that some\nof Frege\u2019s own work is derived from, and heavily indebted to,\nthese Stoic texts.\n",
