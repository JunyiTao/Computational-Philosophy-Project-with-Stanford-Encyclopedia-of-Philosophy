    "main_text": "Objections to Classical Foundationalism || The Sellarsian Dilemma\n3.2 The Sellarsian Dilemma\n\nBonJour was quite aware that some classical foundationalists would\nattempt to avoid the regress problem raised in the previous section by\nappeal to the idea that some things are simply \u201cgiven\u201d to\nus, or that we directly \u201capprehend\u201d or are\n\u201cacquainted with\u201d them. Inspired by Sellars (1963),\nBonJour (1978, 1985: ch. 4) presented the following objection to\nclassical foundationalism, often referred to as the \u201cSellarsian\nDilemma\u201d. Does the awareness or acquaintance that is the alleged\nsource of noninferential justification involve the acceptance of a\nproposition or thought, or at least the categorization of some sensory\nitem or the application of some concept to experience? If, on the one\nhand, the acquaintance or awareness is propositional or conceptual in\nthis way, then while such acts or episodes of awareness seem capable,\nin principle, of justifying other beliefs, they would surely need to\nbe justified themselves. The episode of awareness would involve\nsomething like the acceptance of a proposition, or the categorization\nof experience, and such an attitude or act clearly needs justification\nif it is to justify anything else. But then, the allegedly\nfoundational belief is not foundational after all. If, on the other\nhand, we can regard direct awareness as nonpropositional and\nnonconceptual, then while these acts or states of awareness do not\nrequire or even admit of justification they also don\u2019t seem\ncapable on their own of providing a reason or justification for\npropositional items like beliefs. Therefore, the classical\nfoundationalist\u2019s acquaintance or direct awareness cannot serve\nas a foundational source of knowledge or justified belief.\n\nOne proposed solution to the dilemma begins by emphasizing that\nacquaintance with a fact is not by itself an epistemic relation. The\nacquaintance theorist can argue that one has a noninferentially\njustified belief that P only when one has the thought that\nP and one is acquainted with the fact that P, the\nthought that P, and the relation of correspondence holding\nbetween the thought that P and the fact that P. On\nsuch a view no single act of acquaintance yields knowledge or\njustified belief, but when everything that is constitutive of a\nthought or a proposition\u2019s being true is immediately before\nconsciousness, there is nothing more that one could want or need to\njustify a belief. Acts of acquaintance, including acquaintance with\npropositions, do not involve belief, judgment, or concept application,\nand so do not need justification. However, if the objects of\nacquaintance, that with which we are acquainted, can be propositional,\nthen perhaps acquaintance with the rights sorts of items (including\npropositional ones) can make a difference to justification. This view\nthus grants that a single act of acquaintance with a fact does not\nprovide justification, but rejects the dilemma\u2019s assumption that\nthere are no acts of acquaintance that can, singly or in any\ncombination, make a difference to justification. (See Fumerton 1995\nfor a reply of this sort. For a reply that is similar in many\nrespects, see BonJour 2000 and 2003.)\n\nA classical foundationalist who prefers McGrew\u2019s (1995, 1998)\nview, according to which noninferentially justified beliefs are formed\nby demonstrative reference, would give a somewhat different response.\nAn act of acquaintance alone is not sufficient for justification; one\nmust also form a belief in such a way that the direct object of\nacquaintance becomes a constituent of the belief itself, or part of\nthe belief\u2019s very content. The relevance of the truth-maker to\nthe proposition believed is transparent and guaranteed by the manner\nin which the belief is formed: acquaintance simply picks out some\nfeature of experience and takes it up into the content of a belief or\njudgment that asserts that the feature exists or is instantiated. This\nview thus grants that an act of acquaintance does not automatically\nprovide justification for a corresponding belief, but rejects the\ndilemma\u2019s assumption that there is no way to use the act of\nacquaintance in forming one\u2019s belief in a way that does make a\ndifference to justification.\n",
