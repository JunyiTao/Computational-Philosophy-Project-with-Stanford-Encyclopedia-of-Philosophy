    "main_text": "The Bible || Property\n2.3 Property\n\n\u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d was one of the ten commandments\n (Exodus 20:15).\n Medieval writers assumed that the institution of private property was\nnormal and right and that property should be respected. However, the\nNew Testament encouraged voluntary poverty: \n\n\nJesus saith to him: If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast,\nand give to the poor\u2026Then Jesus said to his disciples: Amen, I\nsay to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of\nheaven. And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to pass\nthrough the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.\n (Matthew 19:21\u201324;\n cf.\n Luke 18:22)\n \n\n\nThe New Testament also seemed to recommend voluntary communism as an\nideal. The early Christian community in Jerusalem \n\n\nhad but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that aught of\nthe things which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common\nunto them. \u2026 neither was there any one needy among them. For as\nmany as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the\nprice of the things they sold, and laid it down before the feet of the\napostles. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had\nneed.\n (Acts 4:32\u201335;\n cf.\n Acts 2:44\u201345)\n \n\n\nThe leading institutions of medieval Europe included monasticism and\nother forms of religious life based on a vow of poverty and communal\nliving.\n",
