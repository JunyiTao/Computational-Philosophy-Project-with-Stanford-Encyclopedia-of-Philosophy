    "main_text": "Yorck\u2019s Life\n1. Yorck\u2019s Life\n\nCount Paul Yorck von Wartenburg was born in Berlin on March 1, 1835.\nHis grandfather was the famous Field Marshal Hans David Ludwig Yorck\nvon Wartenburg. (The Field Marshal\u2019s courageous signing of the\nConvention of Tauroggen, originally unauthorized by the king and thus\nin effect treasonous, started the Prussian War of Liberation against\nNapoleon in 1813. It made the Field Marshal Yorck a national hero.)\nPaul Yorck\u2019s father, Ludwig David Yorck von Wartenburg, managed\nthe family\u2019s estate at Klein-Oels in Silesia (near Breslau,\ntoday Wrok\u0142aw) where Paul Yorck grew up. Paul Yorck\u2019s\nparents were well-connected to a number of literary, philosophical,\nand artistic circles in Berlin and elsewhere. They were acquainted\nwith Friedrich Schleiermacher, Ludwig Tieck, Bettina von Arnim,\nAlexander von Humboldt, Karl August Varnhagen, Johann Gustav Droysen,\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel, and Ernst von Wildenbruch, to name but a few.\nThe family Yorck von Wartenburg belonged to the dominant elite in\nPrussia and the German Empire. Yorck\u2019s life-long enthusiasm for\nhistory and historical reality must be seen against this biographical\nbackground.\n\nIn 1855 Paul Yorck began his university studies in law at Bonn, but\nsoon moved to the university at Breslau where he also enrolled in\nphilosophy courses. After passing the second law exam, Yorck published\nhis exam essay \u201cThe Catharsis of Aristotle and Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus of Colonus\u201d (Yorck 1866), the only publication by him\nduring his lifetime. When his father passed away in 1865 Yorck took\nover the management of the family estate at Klein-Oels. He also\nassumed his father\u2019s hereditary seat in the Prussian Upper\nChamber [Herrenhaus] where he participated in political\ndebates. He took part in the Franco-Prussian war (1870\u20131871);\nand he was present at the Proclamation of the German Empire in the\nHall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in 1871.\n\nIn the same year Yorck met Dilthey, who had been called to the\nUniversity at Breslau. They quickly became friends and Dilthey was a\nfrequent guest at Klein-Oels, often staying for prolonged working\nholidays. The posthumously published Dilthey\u2013Yorck\nCorrespondence (Yorck 1923) is an impressive testimony to\nthis friendship.\n\nFrom the early 1890s Yorck worked on a manuscript on Heraclitus (Yorck\n1896/97) and a book about the Stances of Consciousness and\nHistory (Yorck\n 1892\u20131897).[1]\n Before his death, Yorck declared the two works unfinished and not\nready for publication. Published only posthumously, they are, in the\nwords of Karlfried Gr\u00fcnder (1970, 55), \u201csketches\u201d of\nfirst drafts for \u201cgreat philosophical books.\u201d Paul Yorck\ndied at Klein-Oels, September 12, 1897. His grandson, Count Peter\nYorck, who had studied Yorck\u2019s unfinished works, was a leading\nmember of the Kreisauer Circle, the German resistance cell responsible\nfor the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944.\n",
