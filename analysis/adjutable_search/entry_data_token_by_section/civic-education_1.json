    "main_text": "The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions || Ancient Greece\n1.1 Ancient Greece\n\nThe ancient Greek city state or polis was thought to be an educational\ncommunity, expressed by the Greek term paideia. The purpose\nof political\u2014that is civic or city\u2014life was the\nself-development of the citizens. This meant more than just education,\nwhich is how paideia is usually translated. Education for the\nGreeks involved a deeply formative and life-long process whose goal\nwas for each person (read: man) to be an asset to his friends, to his\nfamily, and, most important, to the polis.\n\nBecoming such an asset necessitated internalizing and living up to the\nhighest ethical ideals of the community. So paideia included\neducation in the arts, philosophy and rhetoric, history, science, and\nmathematics; training in sports and warfare; enculturation or learning\nof the city\u2019s religious, social, political, and professional\ncustoms and training to participate in them; and the development of\none\u2019s moral character through the virtues. Above all, the person\nshould have a keen sense of duty to the city. Every aspect of Greek\nculture in the Classical Age\u2014from the arts to politics and\nathletics\u2014was devoted to the development of personal powers in\npublic service.\n\nPaideia was inseparable from another Greek concept:\narete or excellence, especially excellence of reputation but\nalso goodness and excellence in all aspects of life. Together\npaideia and ar\u00eate form one process of\nself-development, which is nothing other than civic-development. Thus\none could only develop himself in politics, through participation in\nthe activities of the polis; and as individuals developed the\ncharacteristics of virtue, so would the polis itself become more\nvirtuous and excellent.\n\nAll persons, whatever their occupations or tasks, were teachers, and\nthe purpose of education\u2014which was political life\nitself\u2014was to develop a greater (a nobler, stronger, more\nvirtuous) public community. So politics was more than regulating or\nordering the affairs of the community; it was also a\n\u201cschool\u201d for ordering the lives\u2014internal and\nexternal\u2014of the citizens. Therefore, the practice of Athenian\ndemocratic politics was not only a means of engendering good policies\nfor the city, but it was also a \u201ccurriculum\u201d for the\nintellectual, moral, and civic education of her citizens.\n\u201c\u2026[A]sk in general what great benefit the state derives\nfrom the training by which it educates its citizens, and the reply\nwill be perfectly straightforward. The good education they have\nreceived will make them good men\u2026\u201d (Plato, Laws,\n641b7\u201310). Indeed, later in the Laws the Athenian\nremarks that education should be designed to produce the desire to\nbecome \u201cperfect citizens\u201d who know, preceding Aristotle,\n\u201chow to rule and be ruled\u201d (643e4\u20136).\n",
