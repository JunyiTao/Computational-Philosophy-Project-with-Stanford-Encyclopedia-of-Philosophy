In contemporary popular\ndiscourse, globalization often functions as little more than a synonym\nfor one or more of the following phenomena: the pursuit of classical\nliberal (or \u201cfree market\u201d) policies in the world economy\n(\u201ceconomic liberalization\u201d), the growing dominance of\nwestern (or even American) forms of political, economic, and cultural\nlife (\u201cwesternization\u201d or \u201cAmericanization\u201d),\na global political order built on liberal notions of international law\n(the \u201cglobal liberal order\u201d), an ominous network of\ntop-down rule by global elites (\u201cglobalism\u201d or \u201cglobal technocracy\u201d),\nthe proliferation of new information technologies (the \u201cInternet\nRevolution\u201d), as well as the notion that humanity stands at the\nthreshold of realizing one single unified community in which major\nsources of social conflict have vanished (\u201cglobal\nintegration\u201d). Globalization is a politically-contested\nphenomenon about which there are significant disagreements and\nstruggles, with many nationalist and populist movements and leaders\nworldwide (including Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan,\nHungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and former US President Donald\nTrump) pushing back against what they view as its unappealing\nfeatures.\n\nFortunately, recent social theory has formulated a more precise\nconcept of globalization than those typically offered by politicians\nand pundits. Although sharp differences continue to separate\nparticipants in the ongoing debate about the term, most contemporary\nsocial theorists endorse the view that globalization refers to\nfundamental changes in the spatial and temporal contours of social\nexistence, according to which the significance of space or territory\nundergoes shifts in the face of a no less dramatic acceleration in the\ntemporal structure of crucial forms of human activity. Geographical\ndistance is typically measured in time. As the time necessary to\nconnect distinct geographical locations is reduced, distance or space\nundergoes compression or \u201cannihilation.\u201d The human\nexperience of space is intimately connected to the temporal structure\nof those activities by means of which we experience space. Changes in\nthe temporality of human activity inevitably generate altered\nexperiences of space or territory. Theorists of globalization disagree\nabout the precise sources of recent shifts in the spatial and temporal\ncontours of human life. Nonetheless, they generally agree that\nalterations in humanity\u2019s experiences of space and time are\nworking to undermine the importance of local and even national\nboundaries in many arenas of human endeavor. Since globalization\ncontains far-reaching implications for virtually every facet of human\nlife, it necessarily suggests the need to rethink key questions of\nnormative political theory.\n", "toc": [{"#GlobHistIdea": "1.

Globalization in the History of Ideas\n\nThe term globalization has only become commonplace in the last three\ndecades, and academic commentators who employed the term as late as\nthe 1970s accurately recognized the novelty of doing so (Modelski\n1972). At least since the advent of industrial capitalism, however,\nintellectual discourse has been replete with allusions to phenomena\nstrikingly akin to those that have garnered the attention of recent\ntheorists of globalization. Nineteenth and twentieth-century\nphilosophy, literature, and social commentary include numerous\nreferences to an inchoate yet widely shared awareness that experiences\nof distance and space are inevitably transformed by the emergence of\nhigh-speed forms of transportation (for example, rail and air travel)\nand communication (the telegraph or telephone) that dramatically\nheighten possibilities for human interaction across existing\ngeographical and political divides (Harvey 1989; Kern 1983). Long\nbefore the introduction of the term globalization into recent popular\nand scholarly debate, the appearance of novel high-speed forms of\nsocial activity generated extensive commentary about the compression\nof space.\n\nWriting in 1839, an English journalist commented on the implications\nof rail travel by anxiously postulating that as distance was\n\u201cannihilated, the surface of our country would, as it were,\nshrivel in size until it became not much bigger than one immense\ncity\u201d (Harvey 1996, 242). A few years later, Heinrich Heine, the\n\u00e9migr\u00e9 German-Jewish poet, captured this same experience\nwhen he noted: \u201cspace is killed by the railways. I feel as if\nthe mountains and forests of all countries were advancing on Paris.\nEven now, I can smell the German linden trees; the North Sea\u2019s\nbreakers are rolling against my door\u201d (Schivelbusch 1978, 34).\nAnother young German \u00e9migr\u00e9, the socialist theorist Karl\nMarx, in 1848 formulated the first theoretical explanation of the\nsense of territorial compression that so fascinated his\ncontemporaries. In Marx\u2019s account, the imperatives of capitalist\nproduction inevitably drove the bourgeoisie to \u201cnestle\neverywhere, settle everywhere, and establish connections\neverywhere.\u201d The juggernaut of industrial capitalism constituted\nthe most basic source of technologies resulting in the annihilation of\nspace, helping to pave the way for \u201cintercourse in every\ndirection, universal interdependence of nations,\u201d in contrast to\na narrow-minded provincialism that had plagued humanity for untold\neons (Marx 1848, 476). Despite their ills as instruments of capitalist\nexploitation, Marx argued, new technologies that increased\npossibilities for human interaction across borders ultimately\nrepresented a progressive force in history. They provided the\nnecessary infrastructure for a cosmopolitan future socialist\ncivilization, while simultaneously functioning in the present as\nindispensable organizational tools for a working class destined to\nundertake a revolution no less oblivious to traditional territorial\ndivisions than the system of capitalist exploitation it hoped to\ndismantle.\n\nEuropean intellectuals have hardly been alone in their fascination\nwith the experience of territorial compression, as evinced by the key\nrole played by the same theme in early twentieth-century American\nthought. In 1904, the literary figure Henry Adams diagnosed the\nexistence of a \u201claw of acceleration,\u201d fundamental to the\nworkings of social development, in order to make sense of the rapidly\nchanging spatial and temporal contours of human activity. Modern\nsociety could only be properly understood if the seemingly\nirrepressible acceleration of basic technological and social processes\nwas given a central place in social and historical analysis (Adams\n1931 [1904]). John Dewey argued in 1927 that recent economic and\ntechnological trends implied the emergence of a \u201cnew\nworld\u201d no less noteworthy than the opening up of America to\nEuropean exploration and conquest in 1492. For Dewey, the invention of\nsteam, electricity, and the telephone offered formidable challenges to\nrelatively static and homogeneous forms of local community life that\nhad long represented the main theatre for most human activity.\nEconomic activity increasingly exploded the confines of local\ncommunities to a degree that would have stunned our historical\npredecessors, for example, while the steamship, railroad, automobile,\nand air travel considerably intensified rates of geographical\nmobility. Dewey went beyond previous discussions of the changing\ntemporal and spatial contours of human activity, however, by\nsuggesting that the compression of space posed fundamental questions\nfor democracy. Dewey observed that small-scale political communities\n(for example, the New England township), a crucial site for the\nexercise of effective democratic participation, seemed ever more\nperipheral to the great issues of an interconnected world.\nIncreasingly dense networks of social ties across borders rendered\nlocal forms of self-government ineffective. Dewey wondered, \u201cHow\ncan a public be organized, we may ask, when literally it does not stay\nin place?\u201d (Dewey 1927, 140). To the extent that democratic\ncitizenship minimally presupposes the possibility of action in concert\nwith others, how might citizenship be sustained in a social world\nsubject to ever more astonishing possibilities for movement and\nmobility? New high-speed technologies attributed a shifting and\nunstable character to social life, as demonstrated by increased rates\nof change and turnover in many arenas of activity (most important\nperhaps, the economy) directly affected by them, and the relative\nfluidity and inconstancy of social relations there. If citizenship\nrequires some modicum of constancy and stability in social life,\nhowever, did not recent changes in the temporal and spatial conditions\nof human activity bode poorly for political participation? How might\ncitizens come together and act in concert when contemporary\nsociety\u2019s \u201cmania for motion and speed\u201d made it\ndifficult for them even to get acquainted with one another, let alone\nidentify objects of common concern? (Dewey 1927, 140).\n\nThe unabated proliferation of high-speed technologies is probably the\nmain source of the numerous references in intellectual life since 1950\nto the annihilation of distance. The Canadian cultural critic Marshall\nMcLuhan made the theme of a technologically based \u201cglobal\nvillage,\u201d generated by social \u201cacceleration at all levels\nof human organization,\u201d the centerpiece of an anxiety-ridden\nanalysis of new media technologies in the 1960s (McLuhan 1964, 103).\nArguing in the 1970s and 1980s that recent shifts in the spatial and\ntemporal contours of social life exacerbated authoritarian political\ntrends, the French social critic Paul Virilio seemed to confirm many\nof Dewey\u2019s darkest worries about the decay of democracy.\nAccording to his analysis, the high-speed imperatives of modern\nwarfare and weapons systems strengthened the executive and debilitated\nrepresentative legislatures. The compression of territory thereby\npaved the way for executive-centered emergency government (Virilio\n1977). But it was probably the German philosopher Martin Heidegger who\nmost clearly anticipated contemporary debates about globalization.\nHeidegger not only described the \u201cabolition of distance\u201d\nas a constitutive feature of our contemporary condition, but he linked\nrecent shifts in spatial experience to no less fundamental alterations\nin the temporality of human activity: \u201cAll distances in time and\nspace are shrinking. Man now reaches overnight, by places, places\nwhich formerly took weeks and months of travel\u201d (Heidegger 1950,\n165). Heidegger also accurately prophesied that new communication and\ninformation technologies would soon spawn novel possibilities for\ndramatically extending the scope of virtual reality:\n\u201cDistant sites of the most ancient cultures are shown on film as\nif they stood this very moment amidst today\u2019s street\ntraffic\u2026The peak of this abolition of every possibility of\nremoteness is reached by television, which will soon pervade and\ndominate the whole machinery of communication\u201d (Heidegger 1950,\n165). Heidegger\u2019s description of growing possibilities for\nsimultaneity and instantaneousness in human experience ultimately\nproved no less apprehensive than the views of many of his\npredecessors. In his analysis, the compression of space increasingly\nmeant that from the perspective of human experience \u201ceverything\nis equally far and equally near.\u201d Instead of opening up new\npossibilities for rich and multi-faceted interaction with events once\ndistant from the purview of most individuals, the abolition of\ndistance tended to generate a \u201cuniform distanceless\u201d in\nwhich fundamentally distinct objects became part of a bland\nhomogeneous experiential mass (Heidegger 1950, 166). The loss of any\nmeaningful distinction between \u201cnearness\u201d and\n\u201cdistance\u201d contributed to a leveling down of human\nexperience, which in turn spawned an indifference that rendered human\nexperience monotonous and one-dimensional.\n2. Globalization in Contemporary Social Theory\n\nSince the mid-1980s, social theorists have moved beyond the relatively\nunderdeveloped character of previous reflections on the compression or\nannihilation of space to offer a rigorous conception of globalization.\nTo be sure, major disagreements remain about the precise nature of the\ncausal forces behind globalization, with David Harvey (1989 1996)\nbuilding directly on Marx\u2019s pioneering explanation of\nglobalization, while others (Giddens 19990; Held, McGrew, Goldblatt\n& Perraton 1999) question the exclusive focus on economic factors\ncharacteristic of the Marxist approach. Nonetheless, a consensus about\nthe basic rudiments of the concept of globalization appears to be\nemerging.\n\nFirst, recent analysts associate globalization with\ndeterritorialization, according to which a growing variety of\nsocial activities takes place irrespective of the geographical\nlocation of participants. As Jan Aart Scholte observes, \u201cglobal\nevents can \u2013 via telecommunication, digital computers,\naudiovisual media, rocketry and the like \u2013 occur almost\nsimultaneously anywhere and everywhere in the world\u201d (Scholte\n1996, 45). Globalization refers to increased possibilities for action\nbetween and among people in situations where latitudinal and\nlongitudinal location seems immaterial to the social activity at hand.\nEven though geographical location remains crucial for many\nundertakings (for example, farming to satisfy the needs of a local\nmarket), deterritorialization manifests itself in many social spheres.\nBusiness people on different continents now engage in electronic\ncommerce; academics make use of the latest Internet conferencing\nequipment to organize seminars in which participants are located at\ndisparate geographical locations; the Internet allows people to\ncommunicate instantaneously with each other notwithstanding vast\ngeographical distances separating them. Territory in the sense of a\ntraditional sense of a geographically identifiable location no longer\nconstitutes the whole of \u201csocial space\u201d in which human\nactivity takes places. In this initial sense of the term,\nglobalization refers to the spread of new forms of non-territorial\nsocial activity (Ruggie 1993; Scholte 2000).\n\nSecond, theorists conceive of globalization as linked to the growth of\nsocial interconnectedness across existing geographical and\npolitical boundaries. In this view, deterritorialization is a crucial\nfacet of globalization. Yet an exclusive focus on it would be\nmisleading. Since the vast majority of human activities is still tied\nto a concrete geographical location, the more decisive facet of\nglobalization concerns the manner in which distant events and forces\nimpact on local and regional endeavors (Tomlinson 1999, 9). For\nexample, this encyclopedia might be seen as an example of a\ndeterritorialized social space since it allows for the exchange of\nideas in cyberspace. The only prerequisite for its use is access to\nthe Internet. Although substantial inequalities in Internet access\nstill exist, use of the encyclopedia is in principle unrelated to any\nspecific geographical location. However, the reader may very well be\nmaking use of the encyclopedia as a supplement to course work\nundertaken at a school or university. That institution is not only\nlocated at a specific geographical juncture, but its location is\nprobably essential for understanding many of its key attributes: the\nlevel of funding may vary according to the state or region where the\nuniversity is located, or the same academic major might require\ndifferent courses and readings at a university in China, for example,\nthan in Argentina or Norway. Globalization refers to those processes\nwhereby geographically distant events and decisions impact to a\ngrowing degree on \u201clocal\u201d university life. For example,\nthe insistence by powerful political leaders in wealthy countries that\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank recommend to Latin\nand South American countries that they commit themselves to a\nparticular set of economic policies might result in poorly paid\nteachers and researchers as well as large, understaffed lecture\nclasses in S\u00e3o Paolo or Lima; the latest innovations in\ninformation technology from a computer research laboratory in India\ncould quickly change the classroom experience of students in British\nColumbia or Tokyo. Globalization refers \u201cto processes of change\nwhich underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs\nby linking together and expanding human activity across regions and\ncontinents\u201d (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt & Perraton 1999, 15).\nGlobalization in this sense is a matter of degree since any given\nsocial activity might influence events more or less faraway: even\nthough a growing number of activities seems intermeshed with events in\ndistant continents, certain human activities remain primarily local or\nregional in scope. Also, the magnitude and impact of the activity\nmight vary: geographically removed events could have a relatively\nminimal or a far more extensive influence on events at a particular\nlocality. Finally, we might consider the degree to which\ninterconnectedness across frontiers is no longer merely haphazard but\ninstead predictable and regularized (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt &\nPerraton 1999).\n\nThird, globalization must also include reference to the speed\nor velocity of social activity. Deterritorialization and\ninterconnectedness initially seem chiefly spatial in nature. Yet it is\neasy to see how these spatial shifts are directly tied to the\nacceleration of crucial forms of social activity. As we observed above\nin our discussion of the conceptual forerunners to the present-day\ndebate on globalization, the proliferation of high-speed\ntransportation, communication, and information technologies\nconstitutes the most immediate source for the blurring of geographical\nand territorial boundaries that prescient observers have diagnosed at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century. The compression of space\npresupposes rapid-fire forms of technology; shifts in our experiences\nof territory depend on concomitant changes in the temporality of human\naction. High-speed technology only represents the tip of the iceberg,\nhowever. The linking together and expanding of social activities\nacross borders is predicated on the possibility of relatively fast\nflows and movements of people, information, capital, and goods.\nWithout these fast flows, it is difficult to see how distant events\ncould possibly posses the influence they now enjoy. High-speed\ntechnology plays a pivotal role in the velocity of human affairs. But\nmany other factors contribute to the overall pace and speed of social\nactivity. The organizational structure of the modern capitalist\nfactory offers one example; certain contemporary habits and\ninclinations, including the \u201cmania for motion and speed\u201d\ndescribed by Dewey, represent another. Deterritorialization and the\nexpansion of interconnectedness are intimately tied to the\nacceleration of social life, while social acceleration itself takes\nmany different forms (Eriksen 2001; Rosa 2013). Here as well, we can\neasily see why globalization is always a matter of degree. The\nvelocity or speed of flows, movements, and interchanges across borders\ncan vary no less than their magnitude, impact, or regularity.\n\nFourth, even though analysts disagree about the causal forces that\ngenerate globalization, most agree that globalization should be\nconceived as a relatively long-term process. The triad of\ndeterritorialization, interconnectedness, and social acceleration\nhardly represents a sudden or recent event in contemporary social\nlife. Globalization is a constitutive feature of the modern world, and\nmodern history includes many examples of globalization (Giddens 1990).\nAs we saw above, nineteenth-century thinkers captured at least some of\nits core features; the compression of territoriality composed an\nimportant element of their lived experience. Nonetheless, some\ncontemporary theorists believe that globalization has taken a\nparticularly intense form in recent decades, as innovations in\ncommunication, transportation, and information technologies (for\nexample, computerization) have generated stunning new possibilities\nfor simultaneity and instantaneousness (Harvey 1989). In this view,\npresent-day intellectual interest in the problem of globalization can\nbe linked directly to the emergence of new high-speed technologies\nthat tend to minimize the significance of distance and heighten\npossibilities for deterritorialization and social interconnectedness.\nAlthough the intense sense of territorial compression experienced by\nso many of our contemporaries is surely reminiscent of the experiences\nof earlier generations, some contemporary writers nonetheless argue\nthat it would be mistaken to obscure the countless ways in which\nongoing transformations of the spatial and temporal contours of human\nexperience are especially far-reaching. While our nineteenth-century\npredecessors understandably marveled at the railroad or the telegraph,\na comparatively vast array of social activities is now being\ntransformed by innovations that accelerate social activity and\nconsiderably deepen longstanding trends towards deterritorialization\nand social interconnectedness. To be sure, the impact of\ndeterritorialization, social interconnectedness, and social\nacceleration are by no means universal or uniform: migrant workers\nengaging in traditional forms of low-wage agricultural labor in the\nfields of southern California, for example, probably operate in a\ndifferent spatial and temporal context than the Internet entrepreneurs\nof San Francisco or Seattle. Distinct assumptions about space and time\noften coexist uneasily during a specific historical juncture (Gurvitch\n1964). Nonetheless, the impact of recent technological innovations is\nprofound, and even those who do not have a job directly affected by\nthe new technology are shaped by it in innumerable ways as citizens\nand consumers (Eriksen 2001, 16).\n\nFifth, globalization should be understood as a multi-pronged\nprocess, since deterritorialization, social interconnectedness, and\nacceleration manifest themselves in many different (economic,\npolitical, and cultural) arenas of social activity. Although each\nfacet of globalization is linked to the core components of\nglobalization described above, each consists of a complex and\nrelatively autonomous series of empirical developments, requiring\ncareful examination in order to disclose the causal mechanisms\nspecific to it (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt & Perraton 1999). Each\nmanifestation of globalization also generates distinct conflicts and\ndislocations. For example, there is substantial empirical evidence\nthat cross-border flows and exchanges (of goods, people, information,\netc.), as well as the emergence of directly transnational forms of\nproduction by means of which a single commodity is manufactured\nsimultaneously in distant corners of the globe, are gaining in\nprominence (Castells 1996). High-speed technologies and organizational\napproaches are employed by transnationally operating firms, the\nso-called \u201cglobal players,\u201d with great effectiveness. The\nemergence of \u201caround-the-world, around-the-clock\u201d\nfinancial markets, where major cross-border financial transactions are\nmade in cyberspace at the blink of an eye, represents a familiar\nexample of the economic face of globalization. Global financial\nmarkets also challenge traditional attempts by liberal democratic\nnation-states to rein in the activities of bankers, spawning\nunderstandable anxieties about the growing power and influence of\nfinancial markets over democratically elected representative\ninstitutions. In political life, globalization takes a distinct form,\nthough the general trends towards deterritorialization,\ninterconnectedness across borders, and the acceleration of social\nactivity are fundamental here as well. Transnational movements, in\nwhich activists employ rapid-fire communication technologies to join\nforces across borders in combating ills that seem correspondingly\ntransnational in scope (for example, the depletion of the ozone\nlayer), offer an example of political globalization (Tarrow 2005).\nAnother would be the tendency towards ambitious supranational forms of\nsocial and economic lawmaking and regulation, where individual\nnation-states cooperate to pursue regulation whose jurisdiction\ntranscends national borders no less than the cross-border economic\nprocesses that undermine traditional modes of nation state-based\nregulation. Political scientists typically describe such supranational\norganizations (the European Union, for example, or United\nStates-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA) as important manifestations\nof political and legal globalization. The proliferation of\nsupranational organizations has been no less conflict-laden than\neconomic globalization, however. Critics insist that local, regional,\nand national forms of self-government are being supplanted by\ninsufficiently democratic forms of global governance remote from the\nneeds of ordinary citizens (Maus 2006; Streeck 2016). In contrast,\ndefenders describe new forms of supranational legal and political\ndecision as indispensable forerunners to more inclusive and advanced\nforms of self-government, even as they worry about existing democratic\ndeficits and technocratic traits (Habermas 2015).\n3. The Normative Challenges of Globalization\n\nThe wide-ranging impact of globalization on human existence means that\nit necessarily touches on many basic philosophical and\npolitical-theoretical questions. At a minimum, globalization suggests\nthat academic philosophers in the rich countries of the West should\npay closer attention to the neglected voices and intellectual\ntraditions of peoples with whom our fate is intertwined in ever more\nintimate ways (Dallmayr 1998). In this section, however, we focus\nexclusively on the immediate challenges posed by globalization to\nnormative political theory.\n\nWestern political theory has traditionally presupposed the existence\nof territorially bound communities, whose borders can be more or less\nneatly delineated from those of other communities. In this vein, the\ninfluential liberal political philosopher John Rawls described bounded\ncommunities whose fundamental structure consisted of\n\u201cself-sufficient schemes of cooperation for all the essential\npurposes of human life\u201d (Rawls 1993, 301). Although political\nand legal thinkers historically have exerted substantial energy in\nformulating defensible normative models of relations between states\n(Nardin and Mapel 1992), like Rawls they typically have relied on a\nclear delineation of \u201cdomestic\u201d from \u201cforeign\u201d\naffairs. In addition, they have often argued that the domestic arena\nrepresents a normatively privileged site, since fundamental normative\nideals and principles (for example, liberty or justice) are more\nlikely to be successfully realized in the domestic arena than in\nrelations among states. According to one influential strand within\ninternational relations theory, relations between states are\nmore-or-less lawless. Since the achievement of justice or democracy,\nfor example, presupposes an effective political sovereign, the lacuna\nof sovereignty at the global level means that justice and democracy\nare necessarily incomplete and probably unattainable there. In this\nconventional realist view of international politics, core features of\nthe modern system of sovereign states relegate the pursuit of western\npolitical thought\u2019s most noble normative goals primarily to the\ndomestic arena (Mearsheimer 2003.) Significantly, some prominent\nmid-century proponents of international realism rejected this\nposition\u2019s deep hostility to international law and supranational\npolitical organization, in part because they presciently confronted\nchallenges that we now typically associate with intensified\nglobalization (Scheuerman 2011).\n\nGlobalization poses a fundamental challenge to each of these\ntraditional assumptions. It is no longer self-evident that\nnation-states can be described as \u201cself-sufficient schemes of\ncooperation for all the essential purposes of human life\u201d in the\ncontext of intense deterritorialization and the spread and\nintensification of social relations across borders. The idea of a\nbounded community seems suspect given recent shifts in the\nspatio-temporal contours of human life. Even the most powerful and\nprivileged political units are now subject to increasingly\ndeterritorialized activities (for example, global financial markets or\ndigitalized mass communication) over which they have limited control,\nand they find themselves nested in webs of social relations whose\nscope explodes the confines of national borders. Of course, in much of\nhuman history social relations have transcended existing political\ndivides. However, globalization implies a profound quantitative\nincrease in and intensification of social relations of this type.\nWhile attempts to offer a clear delineation of the\n\u201cdomestic\u201d from the \u201cforeign\u201d probably made\nsense at an earlier juncture in history, this distinction no longer\naccords with core developmental trends in many arenas of social\nactivity. As the possibility of a clear division between domestic and\nforeign affairs dissipates, the traditional tendency to picture the\ndomestic arena as a privileged site for the realization of normative\nideals and principles becomes problematic as well. As an empirical\nmatter, the decay of the domestic-foreign frontier seems highly\nambivalent, since it might easily pave the way for the decay of the\nmore attractive attributes of domestic political life: as\n\u201cforeign\u201d affairs collapse inward onto\n\u201cdomestic\u201d political life, the insufficiently lawful\ncontours of the former make disturbing inroads onto the latter\n(Scheuerman 2004). As a normative matter, however, the disintegration\nof the domestic-foreign divide probably calls for us to consider, to a\ngreater extent than ever before, how our fundamental normative\ncommitments about political life can be effectively achieved on a\nglobal scale. If we take the principles of justice or democracy\nseriously, for example, it is no longer self-evident that the domestic\narena is the exclusive or perhaps even main site for their pursuit,\nsince domestic and foreign affairs are now deeply and irrevocably\nintermeshed. In a globalizing world, the lack of democracy or justice\nin the global setting necessarily impacts deeply on the pursuit of\njustice or democracy at home. Indeed, it may no longer be possible to\nachieve our normative ideals at home without undertaking to do so\ntransnationally as well.\n\nTo claim, for example, that questions of distributive justice have no\nstanding in the making of foreign affairs represents at best empirical\nnaivete about economic globalization. At worst, it constitutes a\ndisingenuous refusal to grapple with the fact that the material\nexistence of those fortunate enough to live in the rich countries is\ninextricably tied to the material status of the vast majority of\nhumanity residing in poor and underdeveloped regions. Growing material\ninequality spawned by economic globalization is linked to growing\ndomestic material inequality in the rich democracies (Falk 1999; Pogge\n2002). Similarly, in the context of global warming and the destruction\nof the ozone layer, a dogmatic insistence on the sanctity of national\nsovereignty risks constituting a cynical fig leaf for irresponsible\nactivities whose impact extends well beyond the borders of those\ncountries most directly responsible. Global warming and\nozone-depletion cry out for ambitious forms of transnational\ncooperation and regulation, and the refusal by the rich democracies to\naccept this necessity implies a failure to take the process of\nglobalization seriously when doing so conflicts with their immediate\nmaterial interests. Although it might initially seem to be\nillustrative of clever Realpolitik on the part of the\nculpable nations to ward off strict cross-border environmental\nregulation, their stubbornness is probably short-sighted: global\nwarming and ozone depletion will affect the children of Americans who\ndrive gas-guzzling SUVs or use environmentally unsound\nair-conditioning as well as the future generations of South Africa or\nAfghanistan (Cerutti 2007). If we keep in mind that environmental\ndegradation probably impacts negatively on democratic politics (for\nexample, by undermining its legitimacy and stability), the failure to\npursue effective transnational environmental regulation potentially\nundermines democracy at home as well as abroad.\n\nPhilosophers and political theorists have eagerly addressed the\nnormative and political implications of our globalizing world. A\nlively debate about the possibility of achieving justice at the global\nlevel pits representatives of cosmopolitanism against myriad\ncommunitarians, nationalists, realists, and others who privilege the\nnation-state and moral, political, and social ties resting on it\n(Lieven 2020; Tamir 2019). In contrast, cosmopolitans tend to\nunderscore our universal obligations to those who reside faraway and\nwith whom we may share little in the way of language, custom, or\nculture, oftentimes arguing that claims to \u201cjustice at\nhome\u201d can and should be applied elsewhere as well (Beardsworth\n2011; Beitz 1999; Caney 2006; Wallace-Brown & Held 2010). In this\nway, cosmopolitanism builds directly on the universalistic impulses of\nmodern moral and political thought. Cosmopolitanism\u2019s critics\ndispute the view that our obligations to foreigners possess the same\nstatus as those to members of particular local and national\ncommunities of which we remain very much a part. They by no means deny\nthe need to redress global inequality, for example, but they often\nexpress skepticism in the face of cosmopolitanism\u2019s tendency to\ndefend significant legal and political reforms as necessary to address\nthe inequities of a planet where millions of people a year die of\nstarvation or curable diseases (Miller 2007; 2013; Nagel 2005). Nor do\ncosmopolitanism\u2019s critics necessarily deny that the process of\nglobalization is real, though some of them suggest that its impact has\nbeen grossly exaggerated (Kymlicka 1999; Nussbaum et al.\n1996; Streeck 2016). Nonetheless, they doubt that humanity has\nachieved a rich or sufficiently articulated sense of a common fate\nsuch that far-reaching attempts to achieve greater global justice (for\nexample, substantial redistribution from the rich to poor) could prove\nsuccessful. Cosmopolitans not only counter with a flurry of\nuniversalist and egalitarian moral arguments, but they also accuse\ntheir opponents of obscuring the threat posed by globalization to the\nparticular forms of national community whose ethical primacy\ncommunitarians, nationalists, and others endorse. From the\ncosmopolitan perspective, the tendency to favor moral and political\nobligations to fellow members of the nation-state represents a\nmisguided and increasingly reactionary nostalgia for a rapidly\ndecaying constellation of political practices and institutions.\n\nA similar divide characterizes the ongoing debate about the prospects\nof democratic institutions at the global level. In a cosmopolitan\nmode, Daniele Archibugi (2008) and the late David Held (1995) have\nargued that globalization requires the extension of liberal democratic\ninstitutions (including the rule of law and elected representative\ninstitutions) to the transnational level. Nation state-based liberal\ndemocracy is poorly equipped to deal with deleterious side effects of\npresent-day globalization such as ozone depletion or burgeoning\nmaterial inequality. In addition, a growing array of genuinely\ntransnational forms of activity calls out for correspondingly\ntransnational modes of liberal democratic decision-making. According\nto this model, \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cnational\u201d matters\nshould remain under the auspices of existing liberal democratic\ninstitutions. But in those areas where deterritorialization and social\ninterconnectedness across national borders are especially striking,\nnew transnational institutions (for example, cross-border referenda),\nalong with a dramatic strengthening and further democratization of\nexisting forms of supranational authority (in particular, the United\nNations), are necessary if we are to assure that popular sovereignty\nremains an effective principle. In the same spirit, cosmopolitans\ndebate whether a loose system of global \u201cgovernance\u201d\nsuffices, or instead cosmopolitan ideals require something along the\nlines of a global \u201cgovernment\u201d or state (Cabrera 2011;\nScheuerman 2014). J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a prominent\ncosmopolitan-minded theorist, has tried to formulate a defense of the\nEuropean Union that conceives of it as a key stepping stone towards\nsupranational democracy. If the EU is to help succeed in salvaging the\nprinciple of popular sovereignty in a world where the decay of nation\nstate-based democracy makes democracy vulnerable, the EU will need to\nstrengthen its elected representative organs and better guarantee the\ncivil, political, and social and economic rights of all Europeans\n(Habermas 2001, 58\u2013113; 2009). Representing a novel form of\npostnational constitutionalism, it potentially offers some broader\nlessons for those hoping to save democratic constitutionalism under\nnovel global conditions. Despite dire threats to the EU posed by\nnationalist and populist movements, Habermas and other\ncosmopolitan-minded intellectuals believe that it can be effectively\nreformed and preserved (Habermas 2012).\n\nIn opposition to Archibugi, Held, Habermas, and other cosmopolitans,\nskeptics underscore the purportedly utopian character of such\nproposals, arguing that democratic politics presupposes deep feelings\nof trust, commitment, and belonging that remain uncommon at the\npostnational and global levels. Largely non-voluntary commonalities of\nbelief, history, and custom compose necessary preconditions of any\nviable democracy, and since these commonalities are missing beyond the\nsphere of the nation-state, global or cosmopolitan democracy is doomed\nto fail (Archibugi, Held, and Koehler 1998; Lieven 2020). Critics\ninspired by realist international theory argue that cosmopolitanism\nobscures the fundamentally pluralistic, dynamic, and conflictual\nnature of political life on our divided planet. Notwithstanding its\npacific self-understanding, cosmopolitan democracy inadvertently opens\nthe door to new and even more horrible forms of political violence.\nCosmpolitanism\u2019s universalistic normative discourse not only\nignores the harsh and unavoidably agonistic character of political\nlife, but it also tends to serve as a convenient ideological cloak for\nterrible wars waged by political blocs no less self-interested than\nthe traditional nation state (Zolo 1997, 24).\n\nOngoing political developments suggest that such debates are of more\nthan narrow scholarly interest. Until recently, some of\nglobalization\u2019s key prongs seemed destined to transform human\naffairs in seemingly permanent ways: economic globalization, as well\nas the growth of a panoply of international and global political and\nlegal institutions, continued to transpire at a rapid rate. Such\ninstitutional developments, it should be noted, were interpreted by\nsome cosmopolitan theorists as broadly corroborating their overall\nnormative aspirations. With the resurgence of nationalist and populist\npolitical movements, many of which diffusely (and sometimes\nmisleadingly) target elements of globalization, globalization\u2019s\nfuture prospects seem increasingly uncertain. For example, with\npowerful political leaders regularly making disdainful remarks about\nthe UN and EU, it seems unclear whether one of globalization\u2019s\nmost striking features, i.e., enhanced political and legal\ndecision-making \u201cbeyond the nation state,\u201d will continue\nunabated. Tragically perhaps, the failure to manage economic\nglobalization so as to minimize avoidable inequalities and injustices\nhas opened the door to a nationalist and populist backlash, with many\npeople now ready to embrace politicians and movements promising to\npush back against \u201cfree trade,\u201d relatively porous borders\n(for migrants and refugees), and other manifestations of globalization\n(Stiglitz 2018). Even if it seems unlikely that nationalists or\npopulists can succeed in fully halting, let alone reversing,\nstructural trends towards deterritorialization, intensified\ninterconnectedness, and social acceleration, they may manage to\nreshape them in ways that cosmopolitans are likely to find alarming.\nWhether or not nationalists and populists can successfully respond to\nmany fundamental global challenges (e.g., climate change or nuclear\nproliferation), however, remains far less likely.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Henry, 1931, <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em>, New\nYork: Modern Library.", "Appadurai, A., 1996, <em>Modernity At Large: Cultural Dimensions\nOf Globalization</em>, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota\nPress.", "Archibugi, Daniele, 2008, <em>The Global Commonwealth of Citizens:\nToward Cosmopolitan Democracy</em>, Princeton: Princeton University\nPress.", "Archibugi, Daniele, Held, David, and Koehler, Martin (eds.), 1998,\n<em>Re-imagining Political Community: Studies in Cosmopolitan\nDemocracy</em>, Stanford: Stanford University Press.", "Beardsworth, Richard, 2011, <em>Cosmopolitanism and International\nRelations Theory</em>, Cambridge: Polity Press.", "Beitz, Charles, 1999, <em>Political Theory and International\nRelations</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press.", "Brown, Garrett W., and Held, David, 2010, <em>The Cosmopolitanism\nReader</em>, Cambridge: Polity Press.", "Cabrera, Luis (ed.), 2011, <em>Global Governance, Global\nGovernment</em>: <em>Institutional Visions for an Evolving World\nSystem</em>, Albany: SUNY Press.", "Caney, Simon, 2005, <em>Justice Beyond Borders</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Castells, Manuel, 1996, <em>The Rise of Network Society</em>,\nOxford: Blackwell.", "Cerutti, Furio, 2007, <em>Global Challenges for Leviathan: A\nPolitical Philosophy of Nuclear Weapons and Global Warming</em>,\nLanham, MD: Lexington Books.", "Dallmayr, Fred, 1998, <em>Alternative Visions: Paths in the Global\nVillage</em>, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp;
