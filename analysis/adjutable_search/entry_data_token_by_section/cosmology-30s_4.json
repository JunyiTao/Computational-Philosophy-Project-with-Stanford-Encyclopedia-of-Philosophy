    "main_text": "Cosmology and its philosophy\n3. Cosmology and its philosophy\n\nBecause it represented such a radical departure from previous\nscientific thinking about the Universe, relativistic cosmology needed\nto work out its philosophical underpinnings, most especially in regard\nto its methodology. \u2018How is this new science to be\nconducted?\u2019 was thus a compelling question. But method, of\ncourse, is always linked to metaphysics and epistemology. A full-blown\nphilosophical discussion was evidently required. It came soon enough:\nwithin a span of less than a year, a vigorous debate between two\nphilosophically opposed camps developed. The debate required nearly\ntwo decades to reach its full resolution. But, with the resolution,\ncosmology had philosophically certified its methodology within the\ncontext of a consensus metaphysics and epistemology. Before going into\nthe details of the debate, however, several general points should be\nnoted. Let us turn to the details of the origin of the debate.\n",
