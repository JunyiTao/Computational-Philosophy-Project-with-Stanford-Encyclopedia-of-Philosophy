    "main_text": "Bodily Practices || Performativity\n5.2 Performativity \n\nIn the work of Butler (1990, 1993, 2004), the subjection of our bodies\nto such normalizing practices become viewed, not only a way in which\nalready sexed bodies seek to approximate an ideal, but as the process\nwhereby sexed subjects come into existence at all. Here Butler is\nfollowing Beauvoir\u2019s claim that we become\ndifferentiated as women and men, rather than being born as such. Since\n1990 with the appearance of Gender Trouble, her performative\naccount of gendered subjectivity has dominated feminist theory. Butler\nrejects the view that gender differences, with their accompanying\npresumptions of heterosexuality, have their origin in biological or\nnatural differences. She explores, instead, how such a\n\u201cnaturalising trick\u201d is pulled off; asking by what means a\nunity of biology, gendered identification, and heterosexuality comes\nto appear natural. Butler, like Foucault, views discourses as\nproductive of the identities they appear to be describing. When a baby\nis born and the midwife says \u201cit\u2019s a girl\u201d she is\nnot reporting an already determinate state of affairs, but taking part\nin a practice which constitutes that state of affairs. The effect of\nrepetition of acts of this kind is to make it appear that\nthere are two distinct natures, male and female. These gendered\nperformances are ones which we act out ourselves and which others act\nout in relation to us. They are acted out in accordance with social\nscripts prescribing ideals which are unrealizable, but which\nnone the less provide the framework for our activities. These dominant\nideals reinforce the power of certain groups; e.g., men and\nheterosexuals, over others. These others: women, gay people, trans and\ngender non-conforming people, those with differently abled bodies, or\nbodies differently shaped from the dominant ideal, are treated\nsocially as outsiders, \u201cthe abject\u201d, and subject to social\npunishments.\n\nThe performances by means of which our bodies become gendered vary in\ndifferent contexts, and can change over time. Constituting myself as a\ncaring mother, my performance would differ from that of a sexy pop\nstar. Moreover these practices are not independent of those which\nproduce other aspects of our identity. Butler has stressed the way in\nwhich gendered performances incorporate a presumptive heterosexuality;\nbut, as intersectional theorists have made clear, they also are\nco-constituted with class, race and national and cultural positioning,\nas well as age and a variety of forms of abilities and disabilities.\nIn bodily acts manifesting gendered positionality, other social\npositions are carried along, in such a way that it is not possible to\ndisentangle a strand of gender which is universally present.\n\nIf gender becomes a matter of bodily style and performance, as this\nmodel suggests, then there is no necessary link between\ngender and any particular bodily shape. The alignment between\nanatomical shape and gendered performance is itself just a norm.\nFurthermore this norm, along with others governing gendered\nperformance, is open to destabilization and change. For Butler same\nsex practices are one way of destabilizing the normative links of\ngender and heterosexuality. Various trans performances, in a parallel\nway, challenge the link of anatomical shape and gender. The trans\ncommunity, problematised by sexual difference theory, therefore comes\nto occupy a central position for Butler. They are pivotal to the\nprocess of \u201cqueering\u201d by means of which gender binaries,\nestablished by normalizing practices, are to be undermined and\nunravelled. So, for example, the television documentary, Pregnant\nMan by McDonald (2008), featuring a pregnant man who is referred\nto as a man and presented as a regular guy, works to undermine our\nbinaries. What remains problematic about this, however, is that the\neffect of performance is unpredictable. Drag, for example, can support\nor dislodge gendered stereotypes and we cannot always sort out which\nany instance will produce. This make possibilities for reflective\nagency difficult to negotiate (McNay 2000).\n",
