    "main_text": "Disunity and pluralism || Metapluralism\n6. Conclusion: Why unity? And what difference does it really make?\n\nFrom Greek philosophy to current debates, justifications for adopting\npositions on matters of unification have varied from the metaphysical\nand theological to the epistemic, social and pragmatic. Whether as a\nmatter of truth (Thalos 2013) or consequence, views on matters of\nunity and unification make a difference in both science and\nphilosophy, and, by application, in society as well. In science they\nprovide strong heuristic or methodological guidance and even\njustification for hypotheses, projects, and specific goals. In this\nsense, different rallying cries and idioms such as simplicity, unity,\ndisunity, emergence or interdisciplinarity, have been endowed with a\nnormative value. Their evaluative role extends broadly. They are used\nto provide legitimacy, even if rhetorically, in social contexts,\nespecially in situations involving sources of funding and profit. They\nset a standard of what carries the authority and legitimacy of what it\nis to be scientific. As a result, they make a difference in scientific\nevaluation, management and application, especially in public domains\nsuch as healthcare and economic decision-making. For instance,\npointing to the complexity of causal structures challenges traditional\ndeterministic or simple causal strategies of policy decision-making\nwith known risks and unknown effects of known properties (Mitchell\n2009). Last but not least is the influence that implicit assumptions\nabout what unification can do have on science education (Klein\n1990).\n\nPhilosophically, assumptions about unification help choose what sort\nof philosophical questions to pursue and what target areas to explore.\nFor instance, fundamentalist assumptions typically lead one to address\nepistemological and metaphysical issues in terms of only results and\ninterpretations of fundamental levels of disciplines. Assumptions of\nthis sort help define what counts as scientific and shape scientistic\nor naturalized philosophical projects. In this sense, they determine,\nor at least strongly suggest, what relevant science carries authority\nin philosophical debate.\n\nAt the end of the day, one should not lose sight of the larger context\nthat sustains problems and projects in most disciplines and practices.\nWe are as free to pursue them as Kant\u2019s dove is free to fly,\nthat is, not without the surrounding air resistance to flap its\nwings upon and against. Philosophy was once thought to stand for the\nsystematic unity of the sciences. The foundational character of unity\nbecame the distinctive project of philosophy, in which conceptual\nunity played the role of the standard of intelligibility. In addition,\nthe ideal of unity, frequently under the guise of harmony, has long\nbeen a standard of aesthetic virtue, although this image has been\neloquently challenged by, for instance, John Bailey and Iris Murdoch\n(Bailey 1976; Murdoch 1992). Unities and unifications help us meet\ncognitive and practical demands upon our life as well as cultural\ndemands upon our self-images that are both cosmic and earthly. It is\nnot surprising that talk of the many meanings and levels of\nunity\u2014the fundamental level, unification, system, organization,\nuniversality, simplicity, atomism, reduction, harmony, complexity or\ntotality\u2014can place an urgent grip on our intellectual\nimagination.\n",
