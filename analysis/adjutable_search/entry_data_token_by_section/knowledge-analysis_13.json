    "main_text": "Is Knowledge Analyzable?\n7. Is Knowledge Analyzable?\n\nGettier\u2019s paper launched a flurry of philosophical activity by\nepistemologists attempting to revise the JTB theory, usually by adding\none or more conditions, to close the gap between knowledge and\njustified true belief. We have seen already how several of these\nattempts failed. When intuitive counterexamples were proposed to each\ntheory, epistemologists often responded by amending their theories,\ncomplicating the existing conditions or adding new ones. Much of this\ndialectic is chronicled thoroughly by Shope 1983, to which the\ninterested reader is directed.\n\nAfter some decades of such iterations, some epistemologists began to\ndoubt that progress was being made. In her 1994 paper, \u201cThe\nInescapability of Gettier Problems\u201d, Linda Zagzebski suggested\nthat no analysis sufficiently similar to the JTB analysis could ever\navoid the problems highlighted by Gettier\u2019s cases. More\nprecisely, Zagzebski argued, any analysans of the form JTB+X,\nwhere X is a condition or list of conditions logically\nindependent from justification, truth, and belief, would be\nsusceptible to Gettier-style counterexamples. She offered what was in\neffect a recipe for constructing Gettier cases:\n\n(1)Start with an\nexample of a case where a subject has a justified false belief that\nalso meets condition X.\n(2)Modify the case so\nthat the belief is true merely by luck.\n\n\nZagzebski suggests that the resultant case will always represent an\nintuitive lack of knowledge. So any non-redundant addition to the JTB\ntheory will leave the Gettier problem\n unsolved.[28]\n We may illustrate the application of the recipe using one of\nZagzebski\u2019s own examples, refuting Alvin Plantinga\u2019s\n(1996) attempt to solve the Gettier problem by appending to the JTB\nanalysis a condition requiring that the subject\u2019s faculties be\nworking properly in an appropriate environment.\n\nIn step one of Zagzebski\u2019s procedure, we imagine a case in which\na subject\u2019s faculties are working properly in an appropriate\nenvironment, but the ensuing belief, though justified, is false.\nZagzebski invites us to imagine that Mary has very good\neyesight\u2014good enough for her cognitive faculties typically to\nyield knowledge that her husband is sitting in the living room. Such\nfaculties, even when working properly in suitable environments,\nhowever, are not infallible\u2014if they were, the condition would\nnot be independent from truth\u2014so we can imagine a case in which\nthey go wrong. Perhaps this is an unusual instance in which\nMary\u2019s husband\u2019s brother, who looks a lot like the\nhusband, is in the living room, and Mary concludes, on the basis of\nthe proper function of her visual capacity, that her husband is in the\nliving room. This belief, since false, is certainly not knowledge.\n\nIn step two, we imagine Mary\u2019s misidentification of the occupant\nof the living room as before, but add to the case that the husband is,\nby luck, also in the living room. Now Mary\u2019s belief is true, but\nintuitively, it is no more an instance of knowledge than the false\nbelief in the first step was.\n\nSince the recipe is a general one, it appears to be applicable to any\ncondition one might add to the JTB theory, so long as it does not\nitself entail truth. The argument generalizes against all\n\u201cnon-redundant\u201d JTB+X analyses.\n\nOne potential response to Zagzebski\u2019s argument, and the failure\nof the Gettier project more generally, would be to conclude that\nknowledge is unanalyzable. Although it would represent a significant\ndeparture from much analytic epistemology of the late twentieth\ncentury, it is not clear that this is ultimately a particularly\nradical suggestion. Few concepts of interest have proved susceptible\nto traditional analysis (Fodor 1998). One prominent approach to\nknowledge in this vein is discussed in\n \u00a711\n below.\n\nAnother possible line is the one mentioned in\n \u00a72\u2014to\n strengthen the justification condition to rule out Gettier cases as\njustified. In order for this strategy to prevent Zagzebski\u2019s\nrecipe from working, one would need to posit a justification condition\nthat precludes the possibility of step one above\u2014the only\nobvious way to do this is for justification to entail truth. If it\ndoes, then it will of course be impossible to start with a case that\nhas justified false belief. This kind of approach is not at all mainstream, but it does\nhave its defenders\u2014see e.g., Sturgeon\n1993 and Merricks\n1995. Sutton 2007 and Littlejohn 2012 defend factive approaches to\njustification on other grounds.\n\nA third avenue of response would be to consider potential analyses of\nknowledge that are not of the nonredundant form JTB+X. Indeed,\nwe have already seen some such attempts, albeit unsuccessful ones. For\ninstance, the causal theory of knowledge includes a clause requiring\nthat the belief that p be caused by the fact that p.\nThis condition entails both belief and truth, and so is not\nsusceptible to Zagzebski\u2019s recipe. (As we\u2019ve seen, it\nfalls to Gettier-style cases on other grounds.) One family of\nstrategies along these lines would build into an analysis of knowledge\na prohibition on epistemic luck directly; let us consider this sort of\nmove in more detail.\n",
