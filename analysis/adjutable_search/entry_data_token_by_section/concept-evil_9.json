    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action\n3. Contemporary Theories of Evil Action\n\nSpurred on by Arendt\u2019s work, and dissatisfied with analyses of\nevil found in the history of philosophy, several theorists since the\n1980s have sought to offer necessary and sufficient conditions for\nevil. Some theorists focus on evil character, or evil personhood, as\nthe root concept of evil (See, e.g., Haybron 2002b, 280; Perrett 2002,\n304\u2013305; Singer 2004, 190). These theorists consider the concept\nof evil action to be a derivative concept, i.e., they define an evil\naction as the sort of action that an evil person performs. But just as\nmany theorists, or more, believe that the concept of evil action is\nthe root concept of evil (See, e.g., Garrard 1998, 44; Russell 2014,\n31\u201334; Kekes 2005, 2; Thomas 1993, 74\u201382). These theorists\nconsider the concept of evil personhood to be a derivative concept,\ni.e., they define an evil person as someone who performs, or is prone\nto perform, evil actions. Some theorists who believe that evil action\nis the root concept believe that only one or two component properties\nare essential for evil action, while others believe that evil action\nhas a multitude of essential components. This section discusses\ndifferent views about the essential components of evil action.\n",
