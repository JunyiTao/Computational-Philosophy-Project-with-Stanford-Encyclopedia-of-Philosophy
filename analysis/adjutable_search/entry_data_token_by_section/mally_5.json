    "main_text": "Ontology and Logic || Mally\u2019s Deontic Logic\n2.5 Mally\u2019s Deontic Logic\n\n\nWe conclude this section by noting again that Mally developed the\nfirst formal logical system of deontic logic, in Mally 1926. This\nsystem is described and analyzed in some detail in the entry\n Mally\u2019s deontic logic.\n This entry explains how Mally introduced an operator (!) to\nform statements of the form \u2018It ought to be the case that\nA\u2019 (\u2018!A\u2019), and how the logical axioms of his system\nimplied the following, problematic claim:\n\n!A \u2194 A\n\n\n\nThis scheme states that something is obligatory if and only if it is\nthe case. In other words, in Mally\u2019s system, the obligatory and the\nfactual collapse. This, of course, is unacceptable. The first one to\nshow this was Karl Menger in 1939. Further discussion of Mally\u2019s\ndeontic logic can be found in Morscher 1998, as well as in the entry\ncited above, i.e., Lokhorst 2013a. We would like to reiterate\nLokhorst\u2019s claim that despite the flaw in Mally\u2019s deontic logic, his\n\u201cpioneering effort deserves rehabilitation rather than\ncontempt\u201d. See also Lokhorst\u2019s papers on an intuitionistic\nreformulation of Mally\u2019s deontic logic, where he tries to capture\nMally\u2019s basic ideas whilst avoiding the collapse referred to above\n(Lokhorst 2013b and 2015).\n\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that a proper understanding and analysis\nof Mally\u2019s deontic logic can only be reached through his\nparticular meta-ethical view. This will be sketched in \nsection 3, and it is also touched \nby Mally 1940 in his paper on\n\u201cobjective truth\u201d. Yet not even the most recent study of\nthe critical work on Mally\u2019s deontic logic (Krickler 2008) seems\nto be aware of Mally\u2019s philosophy of values and its peculiar\ndescription of value (Wert) and ought\n (Sollen): \u201cValue and ought\ncan only be understood via emotional presentation\u201d (Mally 1926:\n74 or Mally 1971: 312). Much more about that will be explained in the\nfollowing section, especially at the end of\n section 3.3.3 below.\n",
