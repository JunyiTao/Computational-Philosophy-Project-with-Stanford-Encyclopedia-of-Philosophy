    "main_text": "The Middle Wittgenstein\u2019s Finitistic Constructivism || Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Constructive Formalism\n2.1 Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Constructive Formalism\n\nTo best understand Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate Philosophy of\nMathematics, one must fully appreciate his strong variant of\nformalism, according to which \u201c[w]e make\nmathematics\u201d (WVC 34, note 1; PR \u00a7159) by\ninventing purely formal mathematical calculi, with\n\u2018stipulated\u2019 axioms (PR \u00a7202), syntactical\nrules of transformation, and decision procedures that enable us to\ninvent \u201cmathematical truth\u201d and \u201cmathematical\nfalsity\u201d by algorithmically deciding so-called mathematical\n\u2018propositions\u2019 (PR \u00a7\u00a7122, 162).\n\nThe core idea of Wittgenstein\u2019s formalism from 1929 (if\nnot 1918) through 1944 is that mathematics is essentially syntactical,\ndevoid of reference and semantics. The most obvious aspect of this\nview, which has been noted by numerous commentators who do not refer\nto Wittgenstein as a \u2018formalist\u2019 (Kielkopf 1970:\n360\u201338; Klenk 1976: 5, 8, 9; Fogelin 1968: 267; Frascolla 1994:\n40; Marion 1998: 13\u201314), is that, contra Platonism, the\nsigns and propositions of a mathematical calculus do not\nrefer to anything. As Wittgenstein says at (WVC 34,\nnote 1), \u201c[n]umbers are not represented by proxies; numbers\nare there\u201d. This means not only that numbers are there\nin the use, it means that the numerals are the\nnumbers, for \u201c[a]rithmetic doesn\u2019t talk about numbers, it\nworks with numbers\u201d (PR \u00a7109).\n\n\nWhat arithmetic is concerned with is the schema \\(||||\\).\u2014But\ndoes arithmetic talk about the lines I draw with pencil on\npaper?\u2014Arithmetic doesn\u2019t talk about the lines, it\noperates with them. (PG 333)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Wittgenstein says that (WVC 106)\n\u201cmathematics is always a machine, a calculus\u201d and\n\u201c[a] calculus is an abacus, a calculator, a calculating\nmachine\u201d, which \u201cworks by means of strokes, numerals,\netc\u201d. The \u201cjustified side of formalism\u201d, according\nto Wittgenstein (WVC 105), is that mathematical symbols\n\u201clack a meaning\u201d (i.e.,\nBedeutung)\u2014they do not \u201cgo proxy\nfor\u201d things which are \u201ctheir\nmeaning[s]\u201d.\n\n\nYou could say arithmetic is a kind of geometry; i.e. what in geometry\nare constructions on paper, in arithmetic are calculations (on\npaper).\u2014You could say it is a more general kind of geometry.\n(PR \u00a7109; PR \u00a7111)\n\n\nThis is the core of Wittgenstein\u2019s life-long formalism. When we\nprove a theorem or decide a proposition, we operate in a purely\nformal, syntactical manner. In doing mathematics, we do\nnot discover pre-existing truths that were \u201calready there\nwithout one knowing\u201d (PG 481)\u2014we invent\nmathematics, bit-by-little-bit. \u201cIf you want to know what \\(2 +\n2 = 4\\) means\u201d, says Wittgenstein, \u201cyou have to ask how we\nwork it out\u201d, because \u201cwe consider the process of\ncalculation as the essential thing\u201d (PG 333). Hence,\nthe only meaning (i.e., sense) that a mathematical proposition has is\nintra-systemic meaning, which is wholly determined by its\nsyntactical relations to other propositions of the calculus.\n\nA second important aspect of the intermediate Wittgenstein\u2019s\nstrong formalism is his view that extra-mathematical application\n(and/or reference) is not a necessary condition of a\nmathematical calculus. Mathematical calculi do not require\nextra-mathematical applications, Wittgenstein argues, since we\n\u201ccan develop arithmetic completely autonomously and its\napplication takes care of itself since wherever it\u2019s applicable\nwe may also apply it\u201d (PR \u00a7109; cf. PG\n308, WVC 104).\n\nAs we shall shortly see, the middle Wittgenstein is also drawn to\nstrong formalism by a new concern with questions of\ndecidability. Undoubtedly influenced by the writings of\nBrouwer and David Hilbert, Wittgenstein uses strong formalism to forge\na new connection between mathematical meaningfulness and algorithmic\ndecidability.\n\n\nAn equation is a rule of syntax. Doesn\u2019t that explain why we\ncannot have questions in mathematics that are in principle\nunanswerable? For if the rules of syntax cannot be grasped,\nthey\u2019re of no use at all\u2026. [This] makes intelligible the\nattempts of the formalist to see mathematics as a game with signs.\n(PR \u00a7121)\n\n\nIn\n Section 2.3,\n we shall see how Wittgenstein goes beyond both Hilbert and Brouwer by\nmaintaining the Law of the Excluded Middle in a way that\nrestricts mathematical propositions to expressions that are\nalgorithmically decidable.\n",
