    "main_text": "Philosophy || Legal Philosophy\n4.3 Legal Philosophy\n4.3.1 Citizenship\n\nIn her defense of equality, Sophie de Grouchy considers the problems\nbrought about by inequality of status, privileges, and wealth and the\nway in which the law contributes to these problems by maintaining\nprivileges. She is in agreement with the principles debated in the\nearly days of the French revolution, in particular by Emmanuel\nSiey\u00e8s who argued that to be unequal in the eyes of the law is\nto be potentially dominated. That is, a citizen can use a privileged\nrelationship to the law to abuse another. Grouchy argues that this was\none the greatest wrongs of the Ancient R\u00e9gime, i.e., when the\nlaw is not applied equally to all, those who cannot manipulate it\nperceive themselves as dominated:\n\n\n[When the law allows for] privileges, hereditary, personal or local\nwhich offer a legal loophole, direct or indirect, [t]hen the people\nare tempted to see criminal laws as made against them and in favor of\nthe rich, as the result of an association designed to oppress them.\n(Letter VIII, p. 152\n\n4.3.2 Punishment\n\nMuch of Grouchy\u2019s discussion of the law focuses of the question\nof punishment. Before 1789, there were a number of ways in which the\nlaw could kill its criminals depending both on the kind of crime they\nhad committed and their station. Aristocrats were decapitated with a\nsword. This was regarded as the most honorable death, although it was\nnot always the least painful or horrible. The Count Lally-Tollendal,\nwho received the death penalty in 1766 for having betrayed the\nKing\u2019s interest at war, had to be hit three times by the sword\nbefore his neck could be broken and the head detached. Sanson, the\nexecutor of the Revolution, cited his example when defending the\nproposed new machine that would cut heads off neatly and instantly.\nNonetheless, decapitation was more honorable than the sentences\nreserved for commoners of death by hanging (murderers) or the wheel\n(thieves, highway robbers). The crime women were most commonly accused\nof was infanticide or performing abortions. These were punished by\nhanging when they were found guilty of having killed their infants,\nbut, as was most often the case, when evidence was lacking, they would\ndo prison time for fornication, or be freed until more evidence could\nbe found.\n\nGrouchy\u2019s discussion of punishment is clearly influenced by the\nwritings of the Milanese criminologist Cesare Beccaria. Beccaria had\nalready argued for the necessity of equal penalties for all as even\nprivileges must rest on an equal respect for the law. His book On\nCrimes and Punishment published in 1764 was translated in French\nthat same year and published with a lengthy commentary from Voltaire.\nBeccaria came to Paris and spent much of 1776 in Madame\nHelvetius\u2019s salon in Auteuil. His influence was no doubt still\npresent some years later when the Marquis de Condorcet, and their\nfuture brother-in-law Pierre-George Cabanis, and later\nCondorcet\u2019s wife Sophie de Grouchy also became frequent\nvisitors. This, as well as Condorcet\u2019s close connection with\nVoltaire, and his own engagement at the time Beccaria\u2019s book was\npublished in penal reform, goes some way towards explaining\nGrouchy\u2019s affinities with Beccaria\u2019s claims. In her\nLetters on Sympathy, she argues that:\n\n\nIn order for the fear of a sentence to be effective and beneficial the\nsentence must not outrage. Its justice must be perceptible to average\nreason, and it must especially awaken the conscience, at the same time\nas it punishes its silence and slumber. But this will not be so\n[\u2026] if a judge can arbitrarily harden or soften a sentence; if\nthere are privileges, hereditary, personal or local which offer a\nlegal loophole, direct or indirect. (Letter VIII)\n\n4.3.3 Marriage and family laws\n\nDivorce was legalized and made more accessible for a brief period\nduring the French Revolution before it was codified under Napoleon in\na way that made much more difficult to obtain, especially for women.\nGrouchy in her Letters argues in favor not only of divorce,\nbut of short-term, renewable marriage contracts and clear rights for\nchildren born outside marriage and for their mothers. In these she is\nin agreement with another woman philosopher of the Revolution, Olympe\nde Gouges. Grouchy derived these arguments at least in part from\nMontesquieu\u2019s analysis of the Roman law in the Spirit of the\nLaw.\n4.3.4 Commercial law\n\nGrouchy also argued that a heavily regulated market increased poverty,\nforcing the poor to remain poor, or even become poorer because they\ncouldn\u2019t regulate their exchanges or negotiate their work and\nproduction fairly. Grouchy, like Condorcet and Turgot, believed that\nshackling the market with strict laws was a form of domination and\nthat allowing farmers and merchants to set their own prices would go\nsome way towards relieving poverty in the country. Thus she can be\ninterpreted as one of the original defenders of commercial\nrepublicanism (Berg\u00e8s 2018a).",
