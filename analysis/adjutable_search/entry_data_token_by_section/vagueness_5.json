    "main_text": "Subvaluationism\n6. Subvaluationism\n\nWhereas the supervaluationist analyzes borderline cases in terms of\ntruth-value gaps the dialetheist analyzes them in terms of truth-value\ngluts. A glut is a proposition that is both true and false. The rule\nfor assigning gluts is the mirror image of the rule for assigning\ngaps: A statement is true exactly if it comes out true on at least one\nprecisification. The statement is false just if it comes out false on\nat least one precisification. So if the statement comes out true under\none precisification and false under another precisification, the\nstatement is both true and false.\n\nTo avoid triviality, the dialetheist must adopt a paraconsistent logic\nthat stops two contradictory statements from jointly implying\neverything. The resulting \u201csubvaluationism\u201d is a dual of\nsupervaluationism.\n\nThe spiritual father of subvaluationism is Georg Hegel. For Hegel, the\nbasic kind of vagueness is conflict vagueness. The shopper in between\nthe wings of a revolving doorway is both inside the building and\noutside the building. Degree vagueness is just a special case of the\nconflict inherent in becoming. Any process requires a gradual\nmanifestation of a contradiction inherent in the original state. At\nsome stage, a metamorphosizing caterpillar is not a butterfly (by\nvirtue of what it was) and a butterfly (by virtue of what it will be).\nHegelians believed this dialectical conception of vagueness solved the\nsorites and demonstrated the inadequacy of classical logic (Weber\n2010). The Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov (1908 [1937]) proposed a\nlogic of contradiction to succeed classical logic (Hyde 2008,\n93\u20135). One of his students, Henry Mehlberg (1958) went on to\nsubstitute gaps for gluts. The first version of supervaluationism is\nthus a synthesis, reconciling the thesis of classical logic with the\nanti-thesis posed by the logic of contradiction.\n\nFrom a formal point of view, there seems no more reason to prefer one\ndeparture from classical logic rather than the other (Cobreros and\nTranchini 2019). Since Western philosophers abominate contradiction,\nparity with dialetheism would diminish the great popularity of\nsupervaluationism.\n\nA Machiavellian epistemicist will welcome this battle between the gaps\nand the gluts. He roots for the weaker side. Although he does not want\nthe subvaluationist to win, the Machiavellian epistemicist does want\nthe subvaluationist to achieve mutual annihilation with his\nsupervaluationist doppelg\u00e4nger. His political calculation is:\nGaps + Gluts = Bivalence.\n\nPablo Cobreros (2011) has argued that subvaluationism provides a\nbetter treatment of higher-order vagueness than supervaluationism. But\nfor the most part, the subvaluationists (and their frenemies) have\nmerely claimed subvaluationism to be at least as attractive as\nsupervaluationism (Hyde and Colyvan 2008). This modest ambition seems\nprudent. After all, truth-value gaps have far more independent support\nfrom the history of philosophy (at least Western philosophy). Prior to\nthe explosive growth of vagueness research after 1975, ordinary\nlanguage philosophers amassed a panoramic battery of analyses\nsuggesting that gaps are involved in presupposition, reference\nfailure, fiction, future contingent propositions, performatives, and\nso on and so on. Supervaluationism rigorously consolidated these\nappeals to ordinary language.\n\nDialetheists characterize intolerance for contradiction as a shallow\nphenomenon, restricted to a twentieth-century Western academic milieu\n(maybe even now being eclipsed by the rise of China). Experimental\nphilosophers have challenged the old appeals to ordinary language with\nempirical results suggesting that glutty talk is as readily stimulated\nby borderline cases as gappy talk (Alxatib and Pelletier 2011, Ripley\n2011).\n",
