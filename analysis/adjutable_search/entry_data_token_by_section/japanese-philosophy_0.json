    "main_text": "Philosophy as Engaged Knowing\n1. Philosophy as Engaged Knowing\n\nMost Japanese philosophers have assumed the relation between knower\nand known is an interactive conjunction between the two rather than a\nbridge spanning the disjunction between what is in the knower\u2019s\nmind and the known which stands outside it. The Japanese philosopher\nis thus more likely to be viewed as a person who tries to fathom\nreality by working within it rather than one who tries to understand\nit by standing apart from it. In other words, the Japanese\nphilosopher\u2019s project more often involves personal engagement\nthan impersonal detachment. The difference in emphasis between\ntraditional Japanese philosophy and modern Western philosophy became\nclear to the Japanese when the latter was first introduced into their\ncountry in full force in the mid-nineteenth century. A crucial issue\nfor the intellectual leadership of the time was how to identify in\nJapanese what the Westerners called philosophy. Wanting to\nassimilate Western philosophy along with other aspects of Western\nculture, the architects of Japanese modernization wanted to give the\nfield its own Japanese name, rather than treating it as a foreign term\npronounced phonetically.\n\nTo capture the philosophical sense of wisdom\n(-sophy), they picked a likely candidate from the classical\nEast Asian tradition, namely, tetsu. More provocative,\nthough, was their choice for the other part of the neologism, namely,\ngaku. That word also had a classical pedigree: it signified\nlearning, especially in the sense of modeling oneself after a\ntextual or human model (that is, a master text or a personal master).\nProbably more significantly, though, the term gaku at the\ntime was prominent in neologisms for disciplines in the newly\nestablished Western-style universities, functioning as an equivalent\nfor the German Wissenschaft. Hence, it rendered the\n-ology suffix of fields like biology or geology as well as\nthe humanistic \u201csciences\u201d (Wissenschaften) like\nhistory or literary studies. By this protocol of nomenclature, the\nWestern discipline of philosophy came to be called in Japan\nby the compound word tetsugaku and academic philosophers were\n(and still are) called tetsugakusha, that is, \u201cones who\npartake in the Wissenschaft of wisdom.\u201d\n\nThe salient point is that the label chosen was not a more traditional\nterm like tetsujin, \u201cwise people.\u201d A word like\ntetsujin might have more closely approximated the original\nGreek meaning of the philosopher as a \u201clover of wisdom\u201d\nthan does tetsugakusha, which suggests something more like a\n\u201cscholar of wisdomology.\u201d As a result, we might say\ntetsujin better refers to the premodern Japanese sense of the\nphilosopher, that is, a sage who has mastery in one of the traditional\nWays (d\u014d or michi) such as the Way of\nthe buddhas, the Way of the Confucian scholarly sages, the Way of the\n(Shint\u014d) kami, or even one of the Ways of the\ntraditional arts such as calligraphy, tea ceremony, pottery, painting,\nflower arranging, or any of the various martial arts. (Traditional\nJapan used a variety of terms for the sagely master; for convenience\nin this article tetsujin will appear throughout.)\n\nIn effect, by creating the new term tetsugakusha instead of\ndrawing on an already existing term from their own tradition, the\nJapanese were drawing a distinction between two species of\nunderstanding and two forms of philosophizing. One species of knowers\naspires to a scholarly (\u201cscientific\u201d) detachment that\nmutes personal affect with the aim of reflecting external affairs as\nthey exist independently of human ideation. That kind of understanding\nis the goal of the Wissenschaften\u2014the empirical\nsciences, literary criticism, studies of history, and social\nsciences\u2014that define most departments in the academy alongside\nphilosophy.\n\nThe other species of understanding characterizes those who personally\nengage reality, transforming themselves and reality together into a\ncoherent and harmonious whole. That more traditional Japanese sense of\nunderstanding transcends mere skill or know-how, it should be noted.\nTo be a Confucian sage or a master calligrapher is not simply to be\nproficient in technique (any more than being a logician in the West is\nsimply knowing how to construct a syllogism). Although rigorously\ndisciplined in their early training, the members of the engaged\nknowing family of philosophers eventually go beyond fixed templates\nand regimens to respond creatively to what-is. When engaged\nunderstanding prevails, the knower and known collaborate in an act of\ninnovation rather than simple discovery. From the Japanese standpoint,\nin their praxis as philosophers, the tetsugakusha are akin to\nhow geologists understand clay whereas the tetsujin are akin\nto how master potters understand clay. The geologist acquires\nscientific knowledge (geology) to forge an external relation between\nthe knower and the clay, each of which preexists the knowledge and\nbasically remains unchanged by the knowledge (a Wissenschaft\nis typically grounded in the descriptive). By contrast, the knowledge\nof the potter is expressed in, by, and with the clay as an interactive\nproject (the masterwork of pottery). Both the clay and the\n\u201cbodymind\u201d of the potter are transformed in the act of\nengaged wisdom. For the tetsugakusha, philosophy bridges the\nphilosopher\u2019s connection with reality; for the\ntetsujin, on the other hand, philosophy is the Way the\nphilosopher and reality are purposively engaged with each other and\ntransform each other. For the tetsugakusha philosophy is a\nlink the self creates to connect with the world; for the\ntetsujin philosophy is a product created out of the mutual\nengagement between self and world. The distinction parallels what\nHenri Bergson characterized in the opening pages of Introduction\nto Metaphysics as two ways of knowing: \u201cmoving\naround\u201d an object as contrasted with \u201centering it\u201d\n(Bergson 1955, 21).\n",
