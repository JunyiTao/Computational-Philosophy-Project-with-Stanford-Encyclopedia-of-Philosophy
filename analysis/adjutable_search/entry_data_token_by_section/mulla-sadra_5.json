    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Proof for the existence of God\n3.3 Proof for the existence of God\n\nThese doctrines establish the basic principles for Mulla Sadra\u2019s\nargument for the existence of God. There are many proofs for the\nexistence of God because as Mulla Sadra says there are many signs that\nindicate Him and facets about Him (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, VI: 15).\nKalam cosmological proofs began with the intuition of\nphenomenal existence requiring a cause; there was a creation which\nneeded a cause to be. There had to be a reason why there was something\nrather than nothing. Avicenna\u2019s famous proof for the Necessary\nBeing began with the concept of existence, proceeded with a modal\ndistinction between necessity and contingent, and arrived at the\nexigency of a Necessary Being. Avicenna himself called his argument\nthe \u2018proof of the veracious\u2019 (burhan al-siddiqin)\nand his commentator Tusi provided a typology of three proofs for the\nexistence of a Creator, which in turn are the kalam\ncosmological argument, the proof from motion that derives from\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, and the Avicennan ontological\nargument:\n\n\nThe systematic theologians infer from the origination of bodies and\nproperties [pertaining to them] the existence of the Creator and from\nconsidering the states of the creation to his attributes one after\nanother.\n\nThe natural philosophers also infer from the existence of motion a\nMover and from the impossibility of linking motive beings in a chain\ninfinitely the existence of the First Mover who is unmoved. Then from\nthat they infer the existence of the First Principle.\n\nHowever, the metaphysicians infer from their reflection upon being\nthat it is either necessary or contingent to prove the Necessary. Then\nby reflecting upon what is entailed by necessity and contingency, they\ninfer his attributes and from his attributes they infer the nature of\nthe emanation of his acts from him one after another.\n\nThe master mentioned the preponderance of this method over the others\nbecause it is more reliable and nobler. That is because the more\nexcellent of demonstrations is one that yields certainty and it is the\ninference from the cause to the effect; however, its opposite which is\nthe inference from the effect to the cause may yield certainty and\nthat is if the thing sought has a cause that can only be discerned\nthrough it as has been explained in apodeixis. These two\nlevels are posed in his saying \u2014 exalted is He: \u2018We shall\nshow them our signs in the horizons and in their souls until it is\nclear to them that He is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is\nwitness for everything?\u2019 [Q. 41:52] (Avicenna, al-Isharat\nwa-l-tanbihat, Qum, 1996, III: 66-7).\n\n\nTusi mentions two types of argumentation that the tradition describes\nas assertoric proof or quia (burhan inni) and\ndemonstrative proof or propter quid (burhan limmi),\nthe former is an inference from effect to cause and the latter is from\ncause to effect. The demonstrative proof for Mulla Sadra is the one\nthat is \u2018most reliable, most illuminating and most noble\u2019\nand it involves an inference of reality by taking God, Existence, as a\nwitness to the totality of existence. This is what he calls the\n\u2018way of the veracious\u2019 (sabil al-siddiqin). What\nhe means by siddiq is not the same as Avicenna and the gap in\nmeaning is a good illustration of the difference in their\nphilosophical method. For Mulla Sadra, the siddiq is one who\npossesses intuition and inner disclosure that is attained through\ngrace and spiritual exercise. In the exegesis of Q. 57:19 on the\nphrase \u2018those who believe in God and His messengers are the\nveracious ones and witness before their Lord\u2019, he argues that\nthe siddiq is characterised by witnessing the truth through\ninner revelation:\n\nWhat is meant by faith in God and his messengers is a perfect degree\nof knowledge that is only realised in true knowers. True, inner\nrevealed faith is meant which the saints and mystics possess\nespecially because they are the veracious ones and witnesses due to\nthe utmost level of their attestation [of truth] acquiring through\ninner revelation (kashf) and due to their self-annihilation\nacquired due to their inner spiritual struggle against the carnal\nforces of their souls (Mulla Sadra 1988, VI: 229).\n\n\nThe Avicennan argument was insufficient because it provided an\nassertoric not a demonstrative proof and because it engaged with the\nconcept but not the concrete reality of being. The Sadrian proof of\nthe veracious is a natural corollary to his position on the\nfundamental reality and modulation of existence; in fact the latter is\nsignificant for its proof.\n\nExistence is a concrete reality that is simple and unique and there is\nno distinction among its individuals essentially except by perfection\nand imperfection and intensity and debilitation (Mulla Sadra 1964:\n69).\n\n\nThese degrees of existence are acts of the divine essence such that\neven cosmological proofs are ultimately ontological. Ontological\nproofs depend on the intelligibility of the concept of being, which\nmust be shared between our notion of our existence and God\u2019s\nexistence. This is precisely the point made earlier about the\npossibility of theology depending upon the concept of modulation.\n\nJourney III of the Four Journeys begins with a discussion of\nthe ways of proving the existence of God. Having discussed previous\ncosmological and ontological proofs, Mulla Sadra expresses his own\n\u2018method of the veracious\u2019 (manhaj al-siddiqin) in\nthe following manner as a \u2018detailed thought\nexperiment\u2019:\n\n\nThe reality of existence (haqiqat al-wujud), by virtue of its\nbeing a simple thing (amran basitan), not possessing an\nessence or a constituent property or a means of being defined, is\nidentical to the Necessary, requiring the most complete perfection\nthat is infinitely intense, because every other degree [of existence],\nwhich is weaker in intensity is not the pure reality of existence.\nRather, it is existence with deficiency since the deficiency of\neverything is other than that thing necessarily. The deficiency of\nexistence is not existence itself but rather its privation and this\nprivation is merely attached to existence concomitantly and not the\nfoundation of existence, due to its actuality in a subsequent degree\n[of existence] and what comes after that. Deficiencies and privations\ncomprise secondary [entities] insofar as they are secondary, but the\nFirst is its complete perfection, which has no definition and nothing\nmay be conceived that is more perfect than it. Deficiency and\nontological indigence issue from emanation and existentiation and are\nperfected by it [the Necessary]. The haeccity of these secondaries is\nattached to the First. So he treats their deficiencies with his\nperfection and their ontological indigence with his ontological\nrichness.\n\nThus through this demonstration is the existence of the Necessary\nproven (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, VI: 17\u20138).\n\n\nThe Sadrian argument may be summarised as follows (in effect combining\ntwo syllogisms):\n\nThere is existence\nExistence is a perfection above which no perfection may be\nconceived\nGod is perfection and perfection in existence\nExistence is a singular and simple reality; there is no\nmetaphysical pluralism\nThat singular reality is graded in intensity in a scale of\nperfection (that is, a denial of a pure monism).\nThat scale must have a limit point, a point of greatest intensity\nand of greatest existence.\nHence God exists (= existence).\n\n\nThus the proof begins with the concept and reality of existence and of\nGod and ends with it. It displays an apparent similarity with the\nargument for the existence of God by intensity or the limit case\nargument found in Aquinas and discussed in Miller 1996, and even more\nrecently in some forms of the modal ontological argument (Nagasawa\n2017, Speaks 2018).\n\nNevertheless, the Sadrian proof remains susceptible to the common\ncriticisms of ontological proofs. It actually seems to be\ntautological. Because he argues that the reality of being eludes human\nability to confine it to discourse, it is not perhaps surprising that\nthe manhaj al-siddiqin is not in strictu sensu an\napodeictic proof. In a perceptive gloss, Tabataba\u2019i (d. 1981),\nthe eminent philosopher and commentator, argues that Mulla Sadra does\nnot provide a demonstration but rather an assertoric argument because\nin effect all proofs for the existence of God begin with his effects\nand deduce his existence as the cause of those effects. This is\nbecause existence is an a priori intuition that all sound\nintellects possess and within that intuition, the existence of a\nNecessary Being is logically necessary. Proofs for the existence of\nGod, therefore, are not attempts at producing demonstrations that\nconvince or even fulfil the scientific parameters within proof theory,\nbut are mere reminders to what we already know in our souls and hence\ncorroborate and support faith in the One. This perhaps why Mulla Sadra\nnever refers to his argument as a \u2018demonstration\u2019 but as a\nway (manhaj) of understanding and as a thought experiment\n(tadhkira). Thus the \u2018argument\u2019 may be a useful\nmeans for the exposition of a theistic viewpoint but does not fall\ninto the category of persuasion.\n",
