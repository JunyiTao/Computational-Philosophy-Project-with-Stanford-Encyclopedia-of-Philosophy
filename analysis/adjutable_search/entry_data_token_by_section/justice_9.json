    "main_text": "Justice: Four Distinctions || Comparative versus Non-Comparative Justice\n2.4 Comparative versus Non-Comparative Justice\n\nJustice takes a comparative form when to determine what is due to one\nperson we need to look at what others can also claim: to determine how\nlarge a slice of pie is rightfully John\u2019s, we have to know how\nmany others have a claim to the pie, and also what the principle for\nsharing it should be \u2013 equality, or something else. Justice\ntakes a non-comparative form when we can determine what is due to a\nperson merely by knowing relevant facts about that particular person:\nif John has already been promised the whole of the pie, then that is\nwhat he can rightfully claim for himself. Some theories of justice\nseem to imply that justice is always a comparative notion \u2013 for\nexample when it is said that justice consists in the absence of\narbitrary inequality \u2013 whereas others imply that it is always\nnon-comparative. But conceptually, at least, both forms seem\nadmissible; indeed we can find cases in which it appears we have to\nchoose between doing justice comparatively and doing it\nnon-comparatively (see Feinberg 1974; for a critical response, see\nMontague 1980). For example, we might have several candidates all of\nwhom are roughly equally deserving of an academic honour, but the\nnumber of honours we are permitted to award is smaller than the number\nof candidates. If we honour some but not others, we perpetrate a\ncomparative injustice, but if to avoid doing so we honour no-one at\nall, then each is treated less well than they deserve, and so unjustly\nfrom a non-comparative perspective.\n\nTheories of justice can then be categorised according to whether they\nare comparative, non-comparative, or neither. Principles of equality\n\u2013 principles requiring the equal distribution of some kind of\nbenefit \u2013 are plainly comparative in form, since what is due to\neach person is simply an equal share of the benefit in question rather\nthan any fixed amount. In the case of principles of desert, the\nposition is less straightforward. These principles take the form\n\u2018A deserves X by virtue of P\u2019, where\nX is a mode of treatment, and P is a personal\ncharacteristic possessed by A (Feinberg 1970). In the case of\nboth X and P, we can ask whether they are to be\nidentified comparatively or non-comparatively. Thus what A\ndeserves might either be an entitlement, or an absolute amount of some\nbenefit \u2013 \u2018a living wage\u2019, say \u2013 or it might\nbe a share of some collective benefit, or a multiple or\nfraction of what others are receiving \u2013 \u2018twice what\nB is getting\u2019, say. Turning to P, or what is often\ncalled the desert basis, this may be a feature of A that we can\nidentify without reference to anyone else, or it may be a comparative\nfeature, such as being the best student in a graduating class. So\ndesert-based claims of justice might take one of four different forms\ndepending on whether the basis of desert and/or the deserved mode of\ntreatment is comparative or non-comparative (see Olsaretti 2003 for\nessays that address this question; for a more advanced treatment, see\nKagan 2012, Part III).\n\nAmong principles of justice that are straightforwardly non-comparative\nare \u2018sufficiency\u2019 principles which hold that what justice\nrequires is that each person should have \u2018enough\u2019, on some\ndimension or other \u2013 for instance, have all of their needs\nfulfilled, or have a specified set of capabilities that they are able\nto exercise (for a general defence of sufficiency, though not one that\nlinks it specifically to justice, see Frankfurt 2015; for a critique,\nsee Casal 2007). Such principles, however, need to be supplemented by\nother principles, not only to tell us what to do with the surplus\n(assuming there is one) once everyone has sufficient resources, but\nalso to guide us in situations where there are too few resources to\nbring everyone up to the sufficiency threshold. Should we, for\nexample, maximise the number of people who achieve sufficiency, or\nminimise the aggregate shortfall suffered by those in the relevant\ngroup? Unless we are prepared to say that these are not matters of\njustice, a theory of justice that contains only the sufficiency\nprinciple and nothing else looks incomplete.\n\nSome theories of justice cannot readily be classified either as\ncomparative or as non-comparative. Consider one part of Rawls\u2019\ntheory of social justice, the difference principle, which as noted\nabove requires that social and economic inequalities be arranged to\nthe greatest benefit of the least advantaged (Rawls 1971, 1999,\n\u00a712\u201313). Under this principle, ideally just shares are\ncalculated by determining what each person would receive under the set\nof social institutions whose economic effect is to raise the worst off\nperson to the highest possible level. This is neither a fixed amount,\nnor one that depends in any direct sense on what other individuals are\nreceiving, or should receive. Applying the difference principle does\nrequire making comparisons, but these are comparisons between the\neffects of different social institutions \u2013 say different tax\nlaws, or different ways of defining property rights \u2013 not\nbetween individual people and the amounts of benefit they are\nreceiving. We might call theories of this kind \u2018holistic\u2019\nor \u2018systemic\u2019.\n",
