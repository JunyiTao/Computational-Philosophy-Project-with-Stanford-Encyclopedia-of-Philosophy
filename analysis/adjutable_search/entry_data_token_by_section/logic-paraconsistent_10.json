    "main_text": "Systems of Paraconsistent Logic\n3. Systems of Paraconsistent Logic\n\nA number of formal techniques to invalidate ECQ have been devised.\nAs the interest in paraconsistent logic grew, different\ntechniques developed in different parts of the world. As a result, the\ndevelopment of the techniques has somewhat a regional flavour (though\nthere are, of course, exceptions, and the regional differences can be\nover-exaggerated; see Tanaka 2003). Some of these have been summarised in Brown 2002 and\nPriest 2002. The list of systems canvassed here is by no means exhaustive and will be expanded in future updates.\n\nMost paraconsistent logicians do not propose a wholesale rejection of\nclassical logic. They usually accept the validity of classical\ninferences in consistent contexts. It is the need to isolate an\ninconsistency without spreading everywhere that motivates the\nrejection of ECQ. Depending on how much revision one thinks is needed,\nwe have a technique for paraconsistency. The taxonomy given here is\nbased on the degree of revision to classical logic. (On comparing paraconsistent logics based on proximity to classical logic, see Arieli, Avron and Zamansky (2011) and for more methodological concerns Wansing and Odinstov (2016).) Since the logical novelty can be seen at the propositional level, we will concentrate on\nthe propositional paraconsistent logics.\n",
