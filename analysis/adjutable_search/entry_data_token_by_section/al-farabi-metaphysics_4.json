    "main_text": "F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ontology: the Book of Letters and On the One and Unity || Logical and grammatical form, and the role of particles\n3.2 Logical and grammatical form, and the role of particles\n\nSomething more, however, is needed to explain why\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee concentrates so heavily on the meanings of\nparticles, and why he thinks (as he does) that this study\nwill lead to a scientific investigation of being and its causes.\n\nA crucial point is that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is worried not just\nabout lexical confusions (confusions between two meanings of a term or\nbetween two similar terms), but about confusions arising from the\nmisleading grammatical form of a term: he thinks that these confusions\nhave given rise to serious philosophical errors, and he thinks that\nthe translation process has made such confusions more likely. Part I\nof the Book of Letters distinguishes between the primitive\nterms of a language and the terms derived or \u201cparonymous\u201d\n[mushtaqq] from them. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes the\nnotion of paronymy ultimately from Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories 1 (1a12\u201315). A proper noun like\n\u201cSocrates\u201d, a common noun like \u201chorse\u201d, and an\nabstract accidental term like \u201cwhiteness\u201d are all\nprimitive terms, but the concrete accidental term \u201cwhite\u201d\nis paronymous or derived from \u201cwhiteness\u201d, not necessarily\nin the sense that it arises later in the history of the language than\n\u201cwhiteness\u201d, but in the sense that something is called\n\u201cwhite\u201d (rather than \u201cwhiteness\u201d)\nbecause there is a whiteness in it. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee,\nunlike Aristotle, also treats (finite) verbs as being paronymous from\ntheir infinitives, where the infinitive [ma\u1e63dar] in\nArabic is a noun expressing the action of the verb. The grammatical\nform of a paronymous term suggests that something is X by\nhaving an X-ness present in it, or V\u2019s by\nhaving an action of V-ing in it. But sometimes the\ngrammatical form of a term misleadingly fails to track its logical\nform, and in these cases there is a risk of being deceived by what\nAristotle in On Sophistical Refutations calls sophisms of\nskh\u00eama t\u00eas lexe\u00f4s: this is usually\ntranslated into English as \u201csophisms of figure of speech\u201d,\nbut they would more accurately be called \u201csophisms of\ngrammatical form\u201d, i.e., sophisms which arise because the\ngrammatical form of an expression fails to correspond to its logical\nform, and which can be solved only by diagnosing this\n discrepancy.[17]\n The Arabic translators of Greek philosophical texts, in trying to\nfind Arabic equivalents for the Greek source-terms, often use such\nawkward and potentially misleading expressions, and so do Arabic\nphilosophical texts written in imitation of the language of the\ntranslations. In particular, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that the\nGreek word for \u201cbeing\u201d was non-paronymous, but that some\ntranslators, not finding a good non-paronymous Arabic equivalent,\ninstead used the paronymous word, \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d,\nliterally \u201cfound\u201d, and that this gave rise to the\ngrammatical appearance that something is existent or\n\u201cfound\u201d [mawj\u00fbd] through an existence or\n\u201cfinding\u201d [wuj\u00fbd] present in it, as\nsomething is white through a whiteness present in it.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, applying a methodological principle of\ncharity, seems to assume that in each case the Greek original was free\nof such infelicities: this means that, in practice, his reconstructed\nGreek serves as an ideal logical language, i.e., a language in which\ngrammatical form always tracks logical form.\n\nWhere grammatical form tracks logical form, a non-paronymous noun will\nsignify either a substance or a being in one of the nine Aristotelian\ncategories of accidents, and a paronymous noun or a verb will signify\nthat such a being is present in or attributed to some underlying\nsubject. But metaphysics, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee understands it,\nis not about things in the categories (Book of Letters\nI,11\u201317), but rather about the categories themselves (especially\nsubstance) and about trans-categorial concepts such as being, unity,\nessence, cause, and also God (who also, for F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee,\ndoes not fall under any category). And where grammatical form tracks\nlogical form, these concepts will be signified neither by\nnon-paronymous nouns, nor by paronymous nouns or verbs, but by\nparticles. Particles in an ideal logical language thus correspond\nroughly to what a modern philosopher would call logical constants. And\nit is clear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that at least some\nimportant metaphysical notions were expressed in Greek by particles,\nor by terms morphologically derived from\n particles.[18]\n As noted above, the names of many of the Aristotelian categories in\nArabic (and of some of them in Greek) either are particles or are\nmorphologically derived from particles, and the scientific questions\nfrom Posterior Analytics II, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntreats in Book of Letters Part III, are distinguished by\ntheir different interrogative words (\u201cif/whether\u201d,\n\u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhy\u201d), which in Arabic are all\nparticles. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee may well have thought that the\nGreek original of Metaphysics V was devoted to distinguishing\nthe many meanings of particles (not just of words in\ngeneral), not in the sense that the lexical items that head each\nchapter of Metaphysics V are in all cases themselves\nparticles or even nouns morphologically derived from particles\n(although some of them\n are),[19]\n but in the sense that the many meanings of these nouns would track\nthe many meanings of some particle, as the meanings of the noun\n\u201ccause\u201d (Metaphysics V,2) track the meanings of\nthe particle \u201cbecause\u201d. There is in fact good reason to\nthink this is true for a reasonable number of the chapters of\nMetaphysics\n V.[20]\nMetaphysics V also discusses the categories of quantity and\nquality (V,13\u201314), where, as noted, the name of the category is\nderived from an interrogative word which is a particle in Arabic and\nwhich F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee might well expect to be a particle in\nGreek (although in fact it is not), and the category of substance\n(V,8), where it is reasonable to say that the many meanings of\n\u201csubstance\u201d track the many meanings of the question\n\u201cwhat it is\u201d from Posterior Analytics II and\nBook of Letters Part III, where again the interrogative word\n\u201cwhat\u201d (ti in Greek, m\u00e2 in Arabic)\nis a particle in Arabic. We can also reasonably say that the many\nmeanings of \u201cbeing\u201d (V,7, on in Greek,\nmawj\u00fbd in Arabic) track the many meanings of the\nquestion \u201cwhether it is\u201d from Posterior Analytics\nII and Book of Letters Part III (ei esti in Greek,\nhal mawj\u00fbd in Arabic), where the interrogative word\n\u201cwhether\u201d is a particle in both languages. More\nsurprisingly, although F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee cites the Greek word\nfor \u201cbeing\u201d as ast\u00een = estin,\nwhich is in fact the third-person singular present-tense verb\n\u201cis\u201d, he says explicitly that this word is not a verb and\nthat it is not a paronymous noun: his description of its functions\nimplies that it also cannot be a non-paronymous noun, and so for\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee this word must be a\n particle.[21]\n",
