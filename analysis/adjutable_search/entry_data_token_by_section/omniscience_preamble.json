    "main_text": "\nOmniscience is the property of having complete or maximal knowledge. Along with omnipotence and perfect goodness, it is usually taken to be one of the central divine attributes. One source of the attribution of omniscience to God derives from the numerous biblical passages that ascribe vast knowledge to him. St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae I, q. 14), in his discussion of the knowledge of God, cites such texts as Job 12:13: \u201cWith God are wisdom and strength; he has counsel and understanding\u201d and Rom. 11:33: \u201cO the depths of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!\u201d Another source is provided by the requirements of formulating one or another theological doctrine. For example, the doctrine of divine providence holds that God has a plan for the world according to which all things are in his care and work out according to his good will. As Flint puts it,\n\nto see God as provident is to see him as knowingly and lovingly directing each and every event involving each and every creature toward the ends he has ordained for them (Flint 1998: 12).\n\nIt is thus natural to think than an account of providence requires attributing vast knowledge to God. (For a dissenting interpretation of providence which does not require complete knowledge, see Hasker 2004.) A third motivation for including omniscience among the divine attributes derives from \u201cperfect being theology\u201d. Perfect being theology appeals to St. Anselm, who held that God is that than which nothing greater can be thought (Proslogion, c.1077). Anselm expands on what he means by greatness by giving the formula that \u201cGod is whatever it is better to be than not\u201d, and he concludes that this includes such properties as making other things from nothing, being just, being happy, and being perceptive, omnipotent, and merciful. Anselm can derive omniscience from this list because he holds that \u201cto perceive is nothing else than to know\u201d (Anselm 1998: 90). Other exponents of perfect being theology could simply, and more directly, affirm that it is better to have knowledge than not; so having knowledge is a property that contributes to greatness. Interestingly, the first of these sources, the biblical ascriptions of great knowledge to God, together with additional passages attributing other perfections to him, as Leftow argues, license a version of the third motivation, perfect being theology. On this view, perfect being theology \u201csimply tries to show what authoritative statements about God\u2019s perfections entail\u201d (Leftow 2011: 108).\nThis entry will address philosophical issues concerning omniscience as a divine attribute or a perfection, without considering its potential application in theology.\n",
