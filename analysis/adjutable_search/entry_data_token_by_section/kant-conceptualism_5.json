    "main_text": "Frame I: Conceptual Content || Concepts and Correctness Conditions\n3.3 Concepts and Correctness Conditions\n\nConceptualism states that concepts or conceptual synthesis determine\nthe cognitive relation an intuition has to its object. How should we\nunderstand this notion of a \u2018cognitive relation\u2019 to the\nobject? Conceptualism typically understands this in terms of the\ncorrectness conditions possessed by the intuition and in virtue of\nwhich the intuition represents a (putatively) mind-independent object\nand its properties (Sellars 1968: ch. 1; McDowell 1996; Ginsborg\n2008). This constitutes the attribution to Kant, in more or less\nexplicit terms, of what is now called the \u2018Content View\u2019,\nwhich, in contemporary terms, understands perceptual experience to\npresent or convey information about a subject\u2019s environment to\nthe subject of that experience in virtue of the experience\u2019s\nhaving content (Siegel 2010: \u00a71; 2011: ch. 2). Thus, according to the Content\nView, part of what it is for a mental state to count as an\nobjective experience is that it can be evaluated for its\ncorrectness, and the conditions of its correctness are determined by\nits content.\n\nIt is important that the content attributed to a sensory state by the\nContent View requires more than the state\u2019s merely being\nnon-arbitrarily associated with a representational content.\nFor one might plausibly agree that there are non-arbitrary conditions\nfor associating experiences with particular correctness conditions,\nwithout thereby thinking that experience is something that is had in\nvirtue of a relation to a content that sets such a correctness\ncondition. It is this \u2018in virtue of\u2019 claim that I take to\nbe the distinctive claim of the Content View.\n\nWhat does it mean to say that a sensory experience has\n\u2018content\u2019 in the sense relevant to the Content View?\nContemporary philosophy typically construes the phrase \u201cmental\ncontent\u201d as referring to that thing which fulfills a certain set\nof functional roles\u2014namely, it is that which (i) may be the\nobject of different cognitive states within the same subject (e.g., of\nbelief and desire), (ii) which may be the object of the same (or a\ndifferent) cognitive state in other subjects (e.g., that you and I\nmight be able to believe the same thing and thus communicate), and\n(iii) which has veridicality conditions (e.g., that which you and I\nboth believe is true or both perceive correctly) (see, e.g., Frege\n1956; McGinn 1982; Searle 1983; Fodor 1987; Peacocke 1992; McDowell\n1996; Heck 2000, 2007; Byrne 2005; McGrath 2005 [2014]; Hanks 2009;\nChalmers 2011).\n\nTypically, when contemporary philosophers ask about the content of a\nmental state, they are asking about something which is supposed to\nfulfil these three roles. The traditional satisfier for this\nfunctional specification is an abstract entity\u2014a proposition.\nAccording to this propositionalist view I might, e.g., both see\nthat there is snow on Mt Washington and (thereby) believe\nthat there is snow on Mt Washington. Moreover, you and I may\nboth see that there is snow on Mt Washington, and the\ncontents of our visual experiences may well be accurate. In any case,\nwhether the satisfier of these functional roles for mental content is\na proposition or something else, it must be the kind of thing to which\na mental state can be related, and in virtue of which a sensory state\ncounts as an experience of something (typically, something in the\nexperiencer\u2019s environment).\n\nSticking with the propositional notion of content, for simplicity, we\ncan also note the different kinds of \u201cvehicles\u201d through\nwhich that content can be conveyed. For example a particular token\nsentence \u201cThere is snow on Mt. Washington\u201d conveys the\ncontent there is snow on Mt. Washington. But there may be\nother vehicles for such content as well, including mental vehicles,\nsuch as the act of judging that there is snow on Mt.\nWashington, or the event of seeing that there is snow on Mt.\nWashington. For the purposes of our toy example, all of these\ndifferent vehicles convey the same abstract propositional content,\nwhich sets the correctness conditions for each instance.\n\nHence, in asking whether it is correct to understand Kant as endorsing\nthe Content View, we first need to know whether it is even coherent to\nascribe to him a notion of \u201ccontent\u201d, conceptual or not\n(and irrespective of whether he would use the corresponding German\nword \u201cInhalt\u201d for this notion), in the terms set\nout above.\n\nIt seems highly plausible that Kant did accept the existence of\ncontent as it is functionally specified above. This is his notion of a\n\u201cjudgment\u201d (Urteil). The vehicles for judgment\nare mental states\u2014\u201crepresentations\u201d\n(Vorstellungen). Judgments (or equivalently for Kant,\nthoughts) are the product of \u201crelating\u201d representations,\nin the act of judging, in one consciousness (Prol \u00a722, 4:304; cf.\nJL \u00a717, 9:101; V-Lo/Wiener, 24:928)\n\nIn addition to serving as the content of psychological vehicles (i.e.,\nmental states) and the bearers of truth, Kant also considers\njudgements to be the objects of different epistemic attitudes. For\nexample, he distinguishes between varieties of\n\u201cholding-for-true\u201d or \u201cassent\u201d\n(F\u00fcrwahrhalten) in the Canon of Pure Reason at the end\nof the First Critique (A820/B848; see Stevenson 2003;\nChignell 2007b; Pasternack 2014).\n\nHence, Kant seems to acknowledge the existence of content in the\nrelevant sense. There is something\u2014judgement\u2014that is\ncarried or expressed by psychological states, which can be the object\nof different epistemic attitudes, and which is the bearer of truth and\nfalsity. Furthermore, since judgements are constituted by concepts,\nKant obviously accepts that at least some mental states\u2014i.e.,\nacts of judging\u2014have conceptual content.\n\nThe next question is whether Kant allows that any other mental state\nis also a bearer of conceptual \u2018content\u2019 in the\nrelevant sense. Plausibly, Kant\u2019s conception of\n\u2018experience\u2019 (Erfahrung), insofar as\nthis is a mental state, possesses conceptual content in some sense.\nSince Kant often characterizes experience as a complex state\nconsisting of both intuition and judgment, it may be that experience\npossesses conceptual content simply in virtue of being partly\nconstituted by a conceptual judgment. It is somewhat less clear, given\nthe discussion above, whether there is conceptual content in what Kant\ncalls \u201cperception\u201d (Wahrnehmung). But since\nintuition is the primary locus of the contemporary debate, our\nquestion here is whether the Content View is true of intuition.\n\nSome advocates of Conceptualism (e.g., McDowell 1996, 1998; Ginsborg\n2006b; Gr\u00fcne 2009: 53\u201371) think that it is at least\npartially constitutive of intuition that it have correctness\nconditions. However, this view is also shared by nonconceptualist\ninterpreters (e.g., Hanna 2005). In this way, both Conceptualism and\nNonconceptualism typically agree that an intuition\u2019s cognitive\nrelation to an object depends on correctness conditions constituting\nits \u2018content\u2019 (in the contemporary sense), but disagree as\nto whether that content is conceptual.But, if Kant rejects the Content\nView, and so rejects the claim that it is in virtue of having content\nthat intuition counts as related to an object, a central means for\nframing the dispute between Conceptualism and Nonconceptualism\u2019s\nunderstanding of intuition is undermined.\n\nWhy think that Kant rejects the Content View? McLear (2016b) provides\nthree arguments against the applicability of the Content View to\nKant\u2019s conception of intuition:\n\nKant denies that illusion/hallucination is to be explained by\nappeal to veridicality conditions of intuitive representation.\nKant holds that a state\u2019s possession of correctness\nconditions requires combination, which can only occur via acts of the\nunderstanding.\nKant\u2019s \u201cmodal condition\u201d on cognition requires\nthat sense experience contribute something over and above a\ncorrectness condition to the \u201cproof\u201d of the real\npossibility of a represented object.\n\n\nAccording to the first argument, Kant denies that error due to\nhallucination or illusion may be traced to misrepresentation by\nintuition. As Kant says, \n\n\ntruth and illusion are not in the object in so far as it is intuited,\nbut are in the judgment made about the object in so far as it is\nthought. (A293\u20134/B350) \n\n\nThis would be a surprising thing to say if Kant endorsed the Content\nView, for one of the central reasons for endorsing the Content View\nstems from the straightforward manner in which misleading experience\n(i.e., illusion and hallucination) is explained by erroneous\nrepresentational content in the experience.\n\nThe second argument points out the connection Kant draws between\npossession of a correctness condition and combination or synthesis. As\nKant says at the beginning of the B-edition of the Transcendental\nDeduction, \n\n\na manifold\u2019s combination as such can never come to us through\nthe senses; nor, therefore, can it already be part of what is\ncontained in the pure form of sensible intuition. (B129\u201330) \n\n\nHence, correctness conditions must depend on the intellect, and cannot\nbe given as part of sensible intuition. If the first argument gives us\nreason to doubt that intuition can have \u2018content\u2019 in the\nsense required by the Content View, the second argument explains\nwhy\u2014viz. only intellectual representations can have\n\u2018content\u2019 in the relevant sense.\n\nFinally, the third argument presses the claim that the cognitive\ncontribution of intuition lies not in the possession of correctness\nconditions concerning some perceived object, but rather in the\ncontribution the intuition makes to proving the real possibility of\nthe object, as is required for cognition (Bxxvi). Intuition, in\nrelating a cognizer to an actual being, provides the ground necessary\nto prove its real possibility as an object of thought, and thereby\nprovides the ground necessary for its cognition (more on this point in\n \u00a75.8\n below).\n\nGomes (2017a) raises further considerations against the applicability\nof the Content View to intuition\u2014viz. that (i) representational\ncontent is inherently general in a way that is in marked tension with\nKant\u2019s characterization of intuition as the way in which the\nmind represents particulars (A19/B33; A68/B93; A320/B376-7; JL 9:91);\n(ii) proper consideration of Kant\u2019s argument in the Fourth\nParalogism and Refutation of Idealism militates against the Content\nView.\n\nIn Gomes\u2019 first argument, he appeals to a conception of\nrepresentational content as \u201cspecificational\u201d and thus as\nrequiring \n\n\na selection from amongst the ways the world could be in order to fix\nthe way which determines the truth conditions for the representational\nstate. (Gomes 2017a: 545; see also McLear 2016b: 129\u2013130) \n\n\nThe particularity of intuition seems to be such that it singularly and\nimmediately relates us to particular objects without adverting to\ngeneral marks common to all such objects, and which are constitutive\nof conceptual representation (A19/B33).\n\nIn Gomes\u2019 second argument, he points out that Kant rejects any\ninterpretation of the relation of intuition to its object solely in\nterms of the intuition as the causal result of the inferred\nobject\u2019s effect on the subject\u2019s senses. Kant instead\nclaims that in perceptual experience I have \u201can immediate\nconsciousness of the existence of other things outside me\u201d\n(B276). Gomes elucidates how this point has been picked up and\ndeveloped in contemporary literature on the nature of perceptual\nexperience (Gomes 2017a: 549; see also Child 1994: 147\u2013149;\nCampbell 2002: 132\u2013133).\n\nIf McLear and Gomes are correct much of the contemporary debate\nconcerning Kant\u2019s conception of the content of intuition has\npresupposed a notion of \u201ccontent\u201d that Kant rejects.\nRecall that Conceptualist readings of Kant claim that there is a\nrelevant sense in which (i) intuitions have content; (ii) the content\nof the intuition is conceptual; (iii) it is this conceptual content\nthat constitutes or determines the cognitive relation of the intuition\n(as a mental state or act) to a mind-independent object (or in the\ncase of inner sense, to the object that is oneself). It was seen above\nthat (ii) is problematic because intuition plausibly lacks conceptual\ncontent in Kant\u2019s sense of the term \u201ccontent\u201d\n(Inhalt). With regard to (iii) the standard conception of an\nintuition\u2019s cognitive relation to an object as requiring\njudgment is also problematic. This might seem to indicate that\nConceptualism is false and Nonconceptualism true. However, if Kant\nalso rejects (i), and so the idea that intuitions have content in the\nsense required by the Content View, then even\nNonconceptualist readings of Kant that construe Kant\u2019s\nnonconceptualism in terms of an intuition\u2019s having a\nnonconceptual representational content (e.g., Hanna 2005) are going to\nbe problematic, because that content is still understood in terms of a\nversion of the rejected Content View.\n\nIf these points are all correct then there is a danger that the\ndispute between Conceptualism and Nonconceptualism has simply failed\nto connect with Kant\u2019s views. The next section examines an\nalternative frame from that of the content-centric one. This\nalternative frames the dispute in terms of the presence or absence of\nparticular kinds of cognitive abilities and the dependence relations\nthat may or may not hold between such abilities and the occurrence or\ngeneration of intuition. An advantage of this frame is that it avoids\nthe challenges raised above to the claims constituting the first\nframe.\n",
