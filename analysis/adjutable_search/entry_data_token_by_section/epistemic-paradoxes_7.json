    "main_text": "Anti-expertise\n5. Anti-expertise\n\nIn the surprise test paradox, the student\u2019s premises are\nself-defeating. Any reason the student has for predicting a test date\nor a non-test date is available to the teacher. Thus the teacher can\nsimulate the student\u2019s forecast and know what the student\nexpects.\n\nThe student\u2019s overall conclusion, that the test is impossible,\nis also self-defeating. If the student believes his conclusion then he\nwill not expect the test. So if he receives a test, it will be a\nsurprise. The event will be all the more unexpected because the\nstudent has deluded himself into thinking the test is impossible.\n\nJust as someone\u2019s awareness of a prediction can affect the\nlikelihood of it being true, awareness of that sensitivity to his\nawareness can also affect its truth. If each cycle of awareness is\nself-defeating, then there is no stable resting place for a\nconclusion.\n\nSuppose a psychologist offers you a red box and a blue box (Skyrms\n1982). The psychologist can predict which box you will choose with 90%\naccuracy. He has put one dollar in the box he predicts you will choose\nand ten dollars in the other box. Should you choose the red box or the\nblue box? You cannot decide. For any choice becomes a reason to\nreverse your decision.\n\nEpistemic paradoxes affect decision theory because rational choices\nare based on beliefs and desires. If the agent cannot form a\nrational belief, it is difficult to interpret his behavior as a\nchoice. In decision theory, the whole point of attributing\nbeliefs and desires is to set up practical syllogisms that make sense\nof actions as means to ends. Subtracting rationality from the agent\nmakes the framework useless. Given this commitment to charitable\ninterpretation, there is no possibility of you rationally choosing an\noption that you believe to be inferior. So if you choose, you cannot\nreally believe you were operating as an anti-expert, that is, someone\nwhose opinions on a topic are reliably wrong (Egan and Elga 2005).\n\nThe medieval philosopher John Buridan (Sophismata, Sophism\n13) gave a starkly minimal example of such instability:\n\n(B)\nYou do not believe this sentence. \n\n\nIf you believe (B) it is false. If you do not believe (B) it is true.\nYou are an anti-expert about (B); your opinion is reliably wrong. An\noutsider who monitors your opinion can reckon whether (B) is true. But\nyou are not able to exploit your anti-expertise.\n\nOn the bright side, you are able to exploit the anti-expertise of\nothers. Four out of five anti-experts recommend against reading any\nfurther!\n",
