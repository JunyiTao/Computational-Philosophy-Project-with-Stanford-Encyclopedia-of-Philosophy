    "main_text": "Principles and Theories || Wide Reflective Equilibrium\n2.1 Wide Reflective Equilibrium\n\nAs mentioned above, a narrow reflective equilibrium is\nreached where principles are matched to initial judgments, allowing\nonly for the \u201csmoothing out of certain irregularities\u201d\n(Rawls 1971: 49). In moral and political philosophy this is of\ninterest mainly as a contrast with the wide reflective\nequilibrium endorsed by Rawls, Daniels, and many others in their wake\n(but see Beisbart, Betz, & Brun 2021). A wide reflective\nequilibrium is achieved where the deliberator has brought judgments\nand principles into agreement having reflected on a wide range of\nconsiderations. Wide reflective equilibrium contrasts with narrow\nreflective equilibrium in several respects.\n\nFirst, we are not merely looking for principles that look like our\ninitial judgments, giving our pre-theoretical opinions a philosophical\nsheen. Rather, a wide range of principles should be\nconsidered. Indeed, we should consider all principles to which our\njudgments might plausibly conform, though \u201cit is doubtful\nwhether one can ever reach this state\u201d (Rawls 1971: 49). We will\nreturn to this contrast between the ideal and the practical.\n\nSecond, our initial judgments are revisable. If you encounter\na principle that seems to fit many of your most important judgments,\nor even that does not fit them but has appeal nonetheless, you are\nfree to change judgments that disagree with that principle. Perhaps a\nprinciple even ranges over terrain on which you had no prior judgments\n(e.g., moral dimensions of generative AI), in which case you can make\nnew judgments that agree or disagree with it, as you see fit.\nEverything is up for grabs. (Note that this second feature is\nconsistent with giving initial judgments either no priority or weak\npresumptive priority as discussed earlier.)\n\nThird, we are to consider not just a very wide range of principles,\nbut a wide range of arguments for them. Ideally we\nshould consider all such arguments (Rawls 1971: 49). We are also to\nconsider arguments against principles. The arguments show the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the principles under consideration\n(Daniels 1996: 82). One important kind of argument is the thought\nexperiment. For instance, in relation to the principle of utility, one\nmight consider utilitarian sheriffs, utility monsters, experience\nmachines, trolley problems, and repugnant conclusions, among countless\nothers. A \u201cdirected reflective equilibrium\u201d offers a\nsequencing for consideration of such cases (Slavny et al. 2021). Note\nthat such arguments may not only support one principle over another,\nbut generate new principles, such as variant forms of\nutilitarianism\u2014and there will be new arguments for and against\nthese variants, which generate their own variants, and so on.\n\nFourth, as well as arguments, we should consider \u201cdevices of\nrepresentation\u201d (Rawls 2005: 23\u201328) or\n\u201cjustificatory devices\u201d (Daniels 1996: 59\u201360). It\nmay be that we have greater confidence in certain conditions on the\nselection of principles than we antecedently have in any particular\nprinciples. Prominent examples of such justificatory devices are\nRawls\u2019 original position, other contemporary (Scanlon 1998) and\nhistorical (Locke 1689; Rousseau 1762) contractualist devices, as well\nas their contractarian (Hobbes 1651; Gauthier 1986) and ideal observer\n(Hume 1740, book 3; Smith 1759) counterparts. Whether we find any such\ndevice useful is a matter of whether it fits our judgments in wide\nreflective equilibrium. If we do, we may have a powerful new argument\nfor the principles that the device supports.\n\nFinally, moral and non-moral background theories can inform\nour equilibrium. Arguments for and against principles referred to\nabove are \u201cinferences from relevant background theories\u201d\n(Daniels 1996: 82). Background theories can similarly be used to\ninform our assessment of justificatory devices. For instance, our view\nof Rawls\u2019 contract device may be informed by our view of\npersonal identity (Daniels 1996: 60). Indeed, Rawls\n\n\nwent to great lengths to insure that the principles of justice did\n\u2018fit\u2019 with what we know about psychology, biology,\nevolutionary theory, economics, and other social and natural sciences.\n(Freeman 2007: 40)\n\n\nA wide reflective equilibrium achieves coherence not only between\njudgments and principles regarding the issue at hand, but across the\nfull breadth of the deliberator\u2019s thought that might have\nimplications for it.\n\nTo summarize, wide reflective equilibrium consists of agreement\nbetween revisable judgments and principles following reflection on a\nwide range of principles, arguments, justificatory devices, and\nbackground theories. In its pure form, it is an impossibly demanding\nmethod, drawing a vast and ever-growing expanse of principles,\narguments and theories within its ambit. This exacting standard can\nnevertheless inform our approach to a more modest reflective\nequilibrium, as where Rawls compares his theory of justice\u2019s\n\u201cprinciples and arguments with a few other familiar\nviews,\u201d which \u201cmoves us closer to the philosophical ideal;\nit does not, of course, achieve it\u201d (Rawls 1971: 49, 50; see\nalso Rawls 2005: 97).\n",
