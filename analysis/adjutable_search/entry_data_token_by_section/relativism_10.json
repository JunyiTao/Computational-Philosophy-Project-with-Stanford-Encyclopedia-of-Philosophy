    "main_text": "Why Relativism? || Context Dependence\n2.5 Context Dependence\nRelativists argue that beliefs and values get their justification or truth only relative to specific epistemic systems or practices (see Kusch forthcoming). Strong support for this view has come from social scientists and cultural theorist who focus on the socio-cultural determinants of human beliefs and actions. The social sciences, from their very inception, were hospitable to relativism. Indeed, August Comte, the father of sociology, claimed that a strength of \u201cpositive sociology\u201d was its \u201ctendency to render relative the ideas which were at first absolute\u201d (Comte 1976 [1830\u201342]: 89). Comte also was responsible for the battle cry \u201call is relative\u201d, but immediately and no doubt self-consciously contradicted himself by adding \u201cand that\u2019s the only absolute\u201d. Other social scientists, under the influence of Karl Marx (1818\u20131883), Max Weber (1864\u20131920), and Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911), have given credence to the idea that human beliefs and actions could be understood and evaluated only relative to their social and economic background and context (cf., Kinzel 2019). Beliefs, desires and actions, the argument goes, are never independent of a background of cultural presuppositions, interests and values. We cannot step out of our language, culture and socio-historical conditions to survey reality from an Archimedean vantage point. Even perceptions are \u201ctheory-laden\u201d and could vary between linguistic and cultural groupings. The sociological view that beliefs are context-dependent, in the sense that their context helps explain why people have the beliefs they do, has also been used to support what is sometimes called \u201csocial\u201d or \u201csociological relativism\u201d or the view that truth or correctness is relative to social contexts because we can both understand and judge beliefs and values only relative to the context out of which they arise. Context-dependence is also used to explain empirical observations of diversity in beliefs and values; different social contexts, the argument goes, give rise to differing, possibly incompatible norms and values.\n",
