    "main_text": "The Euthyphro Question || Constitutivist Strategies\n7.3 Objections to Constitutivism\n\nRecent debates about constructivism focus on its \u201cconstitutivist\nstrategy\u201d, which explains the normativity of (practical or\nmoral) reasons in terms of what is constitutive of agency. For\ninstance, Korsgaard (2009) argues that the principles governing action\nare \u201cconstitutive standards\u201d of agency, that is, standards\narising from the nature of agency itself. The marks of agency are\nautonomy and efficacy, and the categorical and hypothetical\nimperatives are norms grounded on these two properties. These norms\nare \u201cconstitutive\u201d of agency in that (i) they determine\nwhat an agent is (\u201cconstitution requirement\u201d), (ii) an\nagent makes herself into an agent, and into the particular agent who\nshe is, by conforming to those standards (\u201cself-constitution\nrequirement\u201d). According to Korsgaard (2019), Kantian\nconstructivism is uniquely positioned to vindicate the\nself-constitution requirement while Humean and Aristotelian theories\nfail to meet it. But there is a disagreement about whether\nconstitutivism is compatible with Kant\u2019s ethics. While some\nscholar hold that the constitutivist strategy is a distinctively\nKantian move in response to moral skepticism (O\u2019Neill 1989,\nKorsgaard 2019, Engstrom 2009, Bagnoli 2019, Shafer 2019), others hold\nthat it does not serve the Kantian agenda (Gobsch 2019, Saemi 2016,\nTenenbaum 2016).\n\nConstitutive standards are supposed to be partly descriptive of the\nvery activity that they have to assess (Korsgaard 2008: 9). Critics\nobject that it is unclear whether and how they can be violated (Cohen\n1996: 177; Lavin 2004; Kolodny 2005). For an agent to be correctly\nsaid to have norms, she must be able to break those norms. Suppose\nthat there is a norm that prevents deception. To say that a rational\nagent is guided by such a norm is to say that she can violate it. But\nif the norm is constitutive of reasoning, how can she break the norm\nby reasoning? If constitutive norms cannot be violated, constitutivism\nimplies that immoralism and irrationality are impossible. Korsgaard\nreplies that to count as acting at all, we must at least be trying to\nfollow the principles of practical reason, but she allows that we may\nfail to do so adequately or fully (Korsgaard 2009: 45\u201349,\n159\u2013176. For instance, while adopting the moral end of\nbenevolence, we may lack grace and understanding, so as to provoke\nresentment, rather than elicit gratitude. Herman proposes that in\ndefective instances of acting, the constitutive norms are not\nmisapplied but misrepresented (Herman 2007: 171\u2013172,\n245\u2013246). For instance, by making a poor judgment about what to\ndo in self-defense, one mischaracterizes and misunderstands what\nself-defense is and what it requires.\n\nA second objection is that the constitutivist strategy partly depends\non the claim that agency is inescapable, but critics think that agency\nis as optional as any other particular activity (Enoch 2006; Tiffany\n2012, Leffner 2019). Constitutivists have tried to answer\nEnoch\u2019s \u201cschmagency\u201d objection by arguing that it\nfails to appreciate the inescapability of agency itself. While it is\npossible to disengage from any particular ordinary activities, some\nsort of agency continues to operate (Ferrero 2010a; Velleman 2009:\n138\u2013141; James 2012). In this sense, agency is not optional.\nEnoch has further objected that, even when some sort of activity is\nalways in place, this is not enough to say that the norms constituting\nthe activity produce normative reasons for action for any one agent\n(Enoch 2011b). But the constitutivist point is that questions about\nreasons to be agents must be taken up within agency (Velleman 2009:\n204\u2013206). One does not need a reason to be an agent rather than\nnot, and so Enoch\u2019s question is not a live question (Rosati\n2016: 201 n. 71; Silverstein 2015: 1136\u20131138). A similar reply\nis produced on the basis of considerations about the desires that are\nappropriate to idealized agents (Smith 2012, 2013; Lindeman 2019).\nFinally, 0\u2019Hagan (2014) defends a minimal conception of\nconstitutivism against Enoch\u2019s shmagency objection, arguing that\nagential constitutivism has the resources to take morality, normative\nand ethical deliberation seriously. She provides an analysis of the\ninescapability and nature of deliberation to support the conclusion\nthat constitutivism coheres with the phenomenology of first-personal\ndeliberation and supports a non-realist but robust account of moral\nobjectivity.\n\nAlthough these replies are effective against some versions of the\nshmagency objection, several authors point out that they leave\nconstitutivism vulnerable to other worries. For instance, Tenenbaum\n(2019) contends that the constitutivism leaves us alienated from the\nmoral norms that it claims we must follow. For Ferrero (2019) the\nappeal to inescapability works best as a defensive move, but fails to\nsustain robust normativity.\n\nWhether agents have conclusive reasons to be agents, however, might\ndepend on the particular version of constitutivism. For most\nconstitutivists, this involves grounding authoritative norms in the\nteleological structure of agency (Korsgaard 2009, Engstrom 2009). For\nothers, the constitutivist project can be salvaged only if it is\nsupplemented with a reductive metanormative account of reasons for\naction, which links reasons to sound or successful practical reasoning\n(Silverstein 2016).\n\nA third worry is voiced by Bratman (2012). He criticizes\nconstructivists for imposing excessive constraints on rational\ndeliberation, which eventually put agents in tension with their own\npre-reflective normative judgments. As a consequence, reflective\nagents may find themselves holding incompatible (prereflective and\nreflective) judgments. For instance, one might be required to\nreflectively give up one\u2019s loyalties and attachments because\nthey do not cohere with one\u2019s impartial duties, even though such\nloyalties shape one\u2019s life. This is a problem even when the\nconstitutive norm is a formal requirement of consistency, as it is for\nStreet. Furthermore, if the input judgments include attitudes such as\nlove and caring, which are not necessarily responsive to\nintersubjective pressures, agents may end up endorsing reflective\njudgments that are not aligned with their unreflective judgments. This\nobjection points to a difficulty for constructivism insofar as it\nadopts constitutive strategies, but it also indicates the importance\nof the temporal dimensions of rational agency (James 2012; Ferrero\n2009, 2010b; Smith 2013: 315ff). Relatedly, s new significant line of\nresearch develops varieties of constructivism that take into account\nthe predicaments of contingency,the possibility normative revisions\n(Baldwin 2013, Richardson 2018), moral progress (Arruda 2016), and\nconcrete forms of normativity (Gledhill and Stein 2020).\n\nIn the last thirty years, constructivism emerged and established\nitself as one recognizable form of metaethics. As with other\nmetaethical theories, it faces serious objections, but it also makes a\nsignificant contribution to many debates, some of which originated\nfrom constructivist challenges to traditional metaethics.\n",
