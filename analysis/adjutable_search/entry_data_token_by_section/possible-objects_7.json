    "main_text": "Fictional Objects\n5. Fictional Objects\n\nLet us shift our attention from mythological creatures to fictional\nobjects. Fictional objects include fictional characters but not all\nfictional objects are fictional characters. Sherlock Holmes is a\nfictional object and a fictional character. His liver is a fictional\nobject but not a fictional character. It may be tempting to think that\nfictional objects are non-actual possible objects, even though it is\nobvious that not all non-actual possible objects are fictional\nobjects.\n\nThere are two main problems with the claim that fictional objects are\npossible objects. One is the problem of impossible fictional objects.\nSome fictional objects are ascribed incompatible properties in their\nhome fiction by their original author (usually inadvertently). This\nseems to be sufficient for them to have those properties according to\ntheir home fiction, for what the author says in the fiction\n(inadvertently or not) seems to hold the highest authority on truth in\nthat fiction. On the assumption that a fictional object has a given\nproperty if it has that property according to its home fiction, those\nfictional objects are impossible objects, for no possible object has\nincompatible properties. The other problem is the failure of\nuniqueness. It may be viewed as the problem of meeting the Quinean\ndemand for clear identity conditions. Holmes is a particular fictional\nobject. So if we are to identify Holmes with a possible object, we\nshould identify Holmes with a particular possible object. But there\nare many particular possible objects that are equally suited for the\nidentification with Holmes. One of them has n-many hairs,\nwhereas another has (n+1)-many hairs. No fictional story\nabout a particular fictional object written or told by a human being\nis detailed enough to exclude all possible objects but one to be\nidentified with that fictional object, unless it is a fiction about an\nactual object or a non-actual possible object analogous to\nKaplan\u2019s automobile or Salmon\u2019s Noman.\n\nStrangely enough, there is also a problem with the claim that\nfictional objects are non-actual objects. That is, there is some\nplausible consideration in support of the claim that fictional objects\nare actual objects. We make various assertions about fictional objects\noutside the stories in which they occur and some of them are true: for\nexample, that Sherlock Holmes is admired by many readers of the Holmes\nstories. The simplest and most systematic explanation appears to be to\npostulate Holmes as an actual object possessing the properties such\ntrue assertions ascribe to him. Fictional objects may then be said to\nbe theoretical objects of literary criticism as much as electrons are\ntheoretical objects of physics. This type of view enjoys surprisingly\nwide acceptance. (Searle 1974, van Inwagen 1977, 1983, Fine 1982,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999). The theorists in this camp, except van\nInwagen (van Inwagen 2003: 153\u201355), also think that fictional\nobjects are brought into existence by their authors as actual objects.\nEven if this type of view is to be followed, it must still be denied\nthat Holmes is actually a detective, for if we enumerate all\nindividuals who are actually detectives, Holmes will not be among\nthem. By the same token, Holmes is not actually a resident of Baker\nStreet or even a human being. Though actual, Holmes is actually hardly\nany of those things Conan Doyle\u2019s stories describe him as being.\nHolmes must not be a concrete object at all but instead an abstract\nobject which has the property of being a detective according to\nDoyle\u2019s stories, the property of being a resident of Baker\nStreet according to Doyle\u2019s stories, and so on.\n\nMeinongian theories overcome the problems of impossibility and\nnon-uniqueness in a straightforward way. According to Parsons\u2019\ntheory, a fictional object x which originates in a certain\nstory is the object that has exactly the nuclear properties F\nsuch that according to the story, Fx (Parsons 1980:\n49\u201360, 228\u201323). A fictional object to which the story\nascribes incompatible properties is simply an impossible object, but\nsuch an object is harmless because it does not exist. As for the\nproblem of non-uniqueness, Sherlock Holmes is not identified as a\ncomplete object. Instead Holmes is said to be the object having just\nthe nuclear properties Holmes has according to the stories. There is\nno number n such that Holmes has exactly n-many\nhairs according to the stories. So Parsons\u2019 Holmes does not have\nn-many hairs, for any n. It is an incomplete\nobject.\n\nZalta offers a similar picture of fictional objects which is subsumed\nunder his general theory of encoding. According to him, a fictional\nobject x which originates in a certain story is the object\nthat encodes exactly the properties F such that according to\nthe story, Fx (Zalta 1988: 123\u201329). Zalta\u2019s\ntreatment of the problem of impossibility is similar to\nParsons\u2019. A fictional object to which the story ascribes\nincompatible properties is an object which encodes those properties,\namong others. Such an object is harmless because it does not exemplify\nthe incompatible properties. Zalta\u2019s solution to the problem of\nnon-uniqueness is equally similar to Parsons\u2019. Sherlock Holmes,\nfor Zalta, is simply an incomplete object which does not encode the\nproperty of having exactly n-many hairs, for any\nn.\n\nThough not meant to be a fictional object, Vulcan may be given the\nsame treatment as explicitly fictional objects. According to Parsons,\nthe word \u2018Vulcan\u2019 is ambiguous. In one sense, it is the\nname of a fictional object which originates in a false astronomical\nstory. In the other sense, it does not refer to anything. Zalta does\nnot recognize Parsons\u2019 second sense and simply regards\n\u2018Vulcan\u2019 as the name of a fictional object.\n\nFor another Meinongian approach to fictional objects, see\nCasta\u00f1eda 1979. Charles Crittenden offers a view in a\nMeinongian spirit but with a later-Wittgensteinian twist (Crittenden\n1991). Like Parsons, Crittenden maintains that some objects do not\nexist and that fictional objects are such objects. Following later\nWittgenstein, however, he sees no need to go beyond describing the\n\u201clanguage game\u201d we play in our fictional discourse and\ndismisses all metaphysical theorizing. Robert Howell criticizes\nParsons\u2019 theory, among others, and recommends an approach which\nconstrues fictional objects as non-actual objects in fictional worlds,\nwhere fictional worlds include not just possible but impossible worlds\n(Howell 1979). Nicholas Wolterstorff argues for the view that\nfictional objects are kinds (Wolterstorff 1980). For criticism of this\nview, see Walton 1983. Van Inwagen 2003 contains useful compact\ndiscussions of some Meinongian and non-Meinongian theories of\nfictional objects.\n\nGregory Currie denies that fictional names like \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019 are proper names or even singular terms (Currie 1990).\nHe claims that sentences of fiction in which \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019 occurs should be regarded as jointly forming a long\nconjunction in which every occurrence of \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019\nis replaced with a variable bound by an initial existential quantifier\nin the way suggested by Frank Ramsey (Ramsey 1931).\n\nKendall Walton urges that we should take seriously the element of\nmake-believe, or pretense, inherent in the telling of a fictional\nstory by the author and the listening to it by the audience (Walton\n1990, also Evans 1982: 353\u201368, Kripke 2013). According to this\npretense theory, the pretense involved in the language game of\nfictional discourse shields the whole language game from a separate\nlanguage game aimed at non-fictional reality, and it is in the latter\nlanguage game that we seek theories of objects of various kinds as\nreal objects. If this is right, any search for the real ontological\nstatus of fictional objects appears to be misguided. For the view that\nthe pretense theory is compatible with a theory of fictional objects\nas real objects, see Zalta 2000.\n",
