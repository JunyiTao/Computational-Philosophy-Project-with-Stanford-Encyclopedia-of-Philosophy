This is a third Rawlsian argument for being\nconcerned with their distribution. Some argue that a minimum of social\nresources are necessary for an individual to enjoy equal opportunities\n(Cordelli 2015b) and that \u201c[s]ocial deprivation conflicts with\nequality of opportunity\u201d (Brownlee 2013, 214). And some\negalitarians noted that the quality of personal, micro-interactions\nbetween parents and children are an important determinant of\nchildren\u2019s future opportunities (Swift 2003; Brighouse &\nSwift 2009, 2014); presumably, some of the influencing of future\nopportunities is due to the benefits in motivation and self-confidence\nthat come with being well loved and emotionally cared for by\none\u2019s parents.\n\nSome philosophers sympathetic to the aim of including personal\nrelationship goods on the agenda of justice deny that the principle of\nequal opportunities to positions of advantage \u2013 like good jobs \u2013\nrequires that all adults enjoy certain relationship goods, like those\nuniquely available through marriage. Brake (2017) illustrates this\nclaim with the case of gay people who can have equal opportunities for\nadvantageous jobs without having access to marriage. It seems,\nhowever, that, if the arguments at\n 3.2\n are correct, some decent social contact that goes beyond occasional\nsocial interactions with strangers is necessary for mental health and\nhence also for equality of opportunity. Further, if the principle of\nfair equality of opportunity applies to all positions of advantage, it\nshould also apply to marriage.\n",
