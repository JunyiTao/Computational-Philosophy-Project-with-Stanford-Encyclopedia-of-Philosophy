    "main_text": "Life and work\n1. Life and work\n\n\nAfter an early education in geometry and astronomy in his native\nPitan\u00ea (in Aeolis, the northwest Aegean coast of modern Turkey),\nArcesilaus escaped to Athens against his guardian\u2019s wishes. There he is\nsaid to have studied rhetoric in association with Theophrastus\n(Aristotle\u2019s successor) until c. 295\u2013290 BCE, when he abandoned\nit to study philosophy in Plato\u2019s Academy with Crantor (d. 276/5) and\nits leaders Polemo (d. 270/69) and Crates (d.268/7). He became the head\nof the Academy (\u2018scholarch\u2019) after Crates\u2019 death and\nled the school for more than 25 years until his own death in 241/40\nBCE.\n\n\nLike Socrates, his philosophical model, and Carneades, who carried\nforward his skepticism in the 2nd c. BCE, Arcesilaus did not\nwrite any philosophical works. His arguments were initially preserved\nby his students\u2014including Pythodorus, who wrote up some of\nthem, and Lakydes, his successor as scholarch\u2014and in the work\nof his opponents, most notably, the Stoic Chrysippus, whose\nreformulation of Stoicism was prompted by Arcesilaus\u2019 criticisms\nof the views of the first generation of Stoics. But Arcesilaus\u2019\narguments were later overlaid by Carneadean elaborations and subsumed\ninto the general Academic and anti-Academic traditions; so it is only\nthrough those later traditions that we know about them. Our knowledge\nof his work depends on scraps from the biographical tradition\n(preserved in Diogenes Laertius and Philodemus) and brief general\nreports from later skeptical writers\u2014Cicero and Sextus\nEmpiricus and Plutarch\u2014and their opponents\u2014Antiochus\nand Numenius (preserved in Cicero and Eusebius respectively). But since\nthese offer incompatible interpretations of Arcesilaus\u2019\nphilosophical position, reflecting the writers\u2019 distinctive views\nabout later developments in the skeptical Academy, the precise nature\nof his skepticism remains controversial.\n",
