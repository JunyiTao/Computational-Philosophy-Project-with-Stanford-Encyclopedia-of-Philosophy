    "main_text": "Practical and Theoretical Reason\n1. Practical and Theoretical Reason\n\n Practical reason defines a distinctive standpoint of\nreflection. When agents deliberate about action, they think about\nthemselves and their situation in characteristic ways. What are some\nof the salient features of the practical point of view?\n\n A natural way to interpret this point of view is to contrast it with\nthe standpoint of theoretical reason. The latter standpoint is\noccupied when we engage in reasoning that is directed at the\nresolution of questions that are in some sense theoretical rather than\npractical; but how are we to understand this opposition between the\ntheoretical and the practical? One possibility is to understand\ntheoretical reflection as reasoning about questions of explanation and\nprediction. Looking backward to events that have already taken place,\nit asks why they have occurred; looking forward, it attempts to\ndetermine what is going to happen in the future. In these ways,\ntheoretical reflection is concerned with matters of fact and their\nexplanation.  Furthermore it treats these issues in impersonal terms\nthat are accessible (in principle) to anyone.  Theoretical reasoning,\nunderstood along these lines, finds paradigmatic expression in the\nnatural and social sciences.\n\n Practical reason, by contrast, takes a distinctively normative\nquestion as its starting point. It typically asks, of a set of\nalternatives for action none of which has yet been performed, what one\nought to do, or what it would be best to do. It is thus concerned not\nwith matters of fact and their explanation, but with matters of value,\nof what it would be desirable to do.  In practical reasoning agents\nattempt to assess and weigh their reasons for action, the\nconsiderations that speak for and against alternative courses of\naction that are open to them. Moreover they do this from a\ndistinctively first-personal point of view, one that is defined in\nterms of a practical predicament in which they find themselves (either\nindividually or collectively\u2014people sometimes reason jointly\nabout what they should do together).\n\n There is, however, a different way of understanding the contrast\nbetween practical and theoretical reason, stressing the parallels\nrather than the differences between the two forms of\nreflection. According to this interpretation, theoretical reflection\ntoo is concerned with a normative rather than a factual question,\nnamely with the question of what one ought to believe.  It attempts to\nanswer this normative question by assessing and weighing reasons for\nbelief, the considerations that speak for and against the particular\nconclusions one might draw about the way the world is. Furthermore, it\ndoes this from a standpoint of first-personal reflection: the stance\nof theoretical reasoning in this sense is the committed stance of the\nbeliever, not the stance of detached contemplation of one\u2019s\nbeliefs themselves (Moran 2001). Seen in this way, the contrast\nbetween practical and theoretical reason is essentially a contrast\nbetween two different systems of norms: those for the regulation of\naction on the one hand, and those for the regulation of belief on the\nother.\n\n Theoretical reason, interpreted along these lines, addresses the\nconsiderations that recommend accepting particular claims as to what\nis or is not the case.  That is, it involves reflection with an eye to\nthe truth of propositions, and the reasons for belief in which it\ndeals are considerations that speak in favor of such propositions\u2019\nbeing true, or worthy of acceptance. Practical reason, by contrast, is\nconcerned not with the truth of propositions but with the desirability\nor value of actions. The reasons in which it deals are considerations\nthat speak in favor of particular actions being good, or worthy of\nperformance in some way. This difference in subject matter corresponds\nto a further difference between the two forms of reason, in respect of\ntheir consequences. Theoretical reflection about what one ought to\nbelieve produces changes in one\u2019s overall set of beliefs, whereas\npractical reason gives rise to action; as noted above, it is practical\nnot only in its subject matter, but also in its issue.\n\n Two observations should be made about this way of understanding\npractical reason. First, the contrast just drawn might suggest that\nthere is a categorial difference in the consequences of theoretical\nand practical reason, insofar as the former produces changes in our\nmental states, whereas the latter gives rise to bodily movements. But\nit would be misleading to contrast the two kinds of rational capacity\nin these terms. Practical reasoning gives rise not to bodily movements\nper se, but to intentional actions, and these are intelligible as such\nonly to the extent they reflect our mental states. It would thus be\nmore accurate to characterize the issue of both theoretical and\npractical reason as attitudes; the difference is that\ntheoretical reasoning leads to modifications of our beliefs, whereas\npractical reasoning leads to modifications of our intentions (Harman\n1986, Bratman 1987).\n\n Second, it is important to be clear that in neither case do the\ncharacteristic modifications of attitude occur infallibly. There is\nroom for irrationality both in the theoretical and the practical\ndomain, which in its strongest form involves a failure to form the\nattitudes that one acknowledges to be called for by the considerations\none has reflected on. Thus a person might end up reading a mystery\nnovel for another hour, while at the same time judging that it would\nbe better on the whole to go back to work on their paper for the\nupcoming conference. Practical irrationality of this latter kind is\nknown as akrasia, incontinence, or weakness of will, and its\nnature and even possibility are traditional subjects of philosophical\nspeculation in their own right. If we assume that this strong kind of\npractical irrationality is possible, however, then we must grant that\npractical reason is not automatically practical in its issue. A more\naccurate way to represent the consequences of practical reason would\nbe to say that deliberation about action generates appropriate\nintentions insofar as an agent is rational (Korsgaard 1996a).  \n\nIntentions and beliefs are not the only attitudes that are answerable\nto reasons; emotions too have their reasons, understood as\nconsiderations by reference to which they can be justified or\ncriticized. Thus it is appropriate or fitting for someone who is in\nthe presence of imminent danger to feel fear, and by the same token\nfear is inapt or irrational if it is felt about something that is not\ndangerous at all. Though emotions are responsive to reasons, however,\nwe do not typically form or modify them through processes of\nreflection or deliberation. Reflective modification of our beliefs and\nintentions, by contrast, is common, and commonly understood to involve\nan exercise of our capacities for theoretical and practical\nreason. \n\nReasoning is an inferential process that takes as input some attitudes\nof a subject, and yields as output the formation or modification of\nother attitudes. Inferential processes of this kind are involved in\nthe paradigmatic cases in which we exercise our capacities for both\ntheoretical and practical reason. In the practical case, however,\nthere is an interesting question about how exactly to understand the\nnew or modified attitudes that are the outputs of our reasoning about\nwhat to do. On a broad understanding of practical reasoning, it is an\ninferential process through which new intentions are formed or old\nones modified. According to this view, we resolve through reasoning\nthe question of what we are going to do (Broome 2013, McHugh and Way\n2016). A narrower understanding has it that reasoning should be\nunderstood as an inferential process whereby we modify our beliefs,\nincluding our normative beliefs about what we ought to do. On this\ninterpretation, practical reasoning, strictly speaking, is an\ninferential process through which we adjust our beliefs about action,\nincluding our beliefs about what we have reason to do; but the\nadjustments in our intentions that result from such reflection are not\nthemselves conclusions of reasoning (Raz 2011, chap. 7). Agents who\nhave resolved the question of what they ought to do still have a\nquestion to settle, about what they are going to do. But proponents of\nthe narrower view would note that this further question is not one\nthat is to be resolved through reasoning: once one has figured out\nwhat one ought to do, there is no practical reasoning left to\nbe done. \n\nProponents of both the broader and the narrower accounts of reasoning\nshould agree, however, that there are rational constraints on\nintentions. The akratic agent, for instance, is a paradigm of\nirrationality, and this means that there is some kind of requirement\nto intend to do what one believes one ought to do (just as there are\nrational norms that are violated when one is afraid of something that\none knows to pose no real danger at all). Our capacity for practical\nreason must involve some capacity to modify our intentions in\naccordance with this requirement, otherwise practical reason will be\npractical only in its subject matter, but not in its issue.\n",
