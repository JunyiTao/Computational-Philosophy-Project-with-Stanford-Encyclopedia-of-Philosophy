In\n Section 4,\n we will lay out those varieties, and note their pairwise logical\nrelations. For now, though, we will stick to the core idea of\nsupervenience\u2014namely, that there cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference. A number of\ngeneral points of philosophical interest can be made just by working\nwith that simple and easy idea.\n",
