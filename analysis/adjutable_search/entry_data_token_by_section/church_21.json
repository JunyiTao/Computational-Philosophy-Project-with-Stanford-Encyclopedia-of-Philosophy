(1932 [BE: 52])\n\n\nIt turned out that despite this restriction a form of Russell\u2019s\nparadox is derivable in the system of 1932. Nevertheless, it was here\nthat Church first formulated the (untyped) \u03bb-calculus as a mere\npart of the whole system. This part turned out to be of great\nimportance for the theory of computation, formal semantics and for the\nfoundations of mathematics in general. So much for inconsistency! (See\n supplement D\n for a description of the \u03bb-calculus).\n\nIn the second paper (Church 1933), the problem about Russell\u2019s\nparadox was corrected. But Kleene and Rosser (1935) established that\nboth systems\u2014those of Church 1932 and 1933\u2014as well as\nrelated early systems of combinatory logic fell prey to\nRichard\u2019s paradox. The mere part\u2014the pure untyped\n\u03bb-calculus\u2014is, however, consistent in the sense that not\nall equations between \u03bb terms are derivable. This follows from\nan early result due to Church himself and Rosser (1936)\u2014the\nChurch-Rosser theorem (see the entry on the\n lambda calculus\n for discussion). Significant mathematical models for the\n\u03bb-calculus were developed later (Scott and Strachey 1971;\nPlotkin 1993; see Hindley & Seldin 2008: ch. 16). Church also\nproved the consistency of a variant of the system of (1933) by\nelementary means (1934), thus escaping, as he hoped, the\nincompleteness theorems of G\u00f6del (1931). But this system was too\nweak to satisfy requirement (2), and Church abandoned the system. (A\ntype-free system with a similar motivation was proposed later by\nMyhill 1975.) It is remarkable that in his failed struggle to produce\na consistent, type-free foundational system, Church nevertheless\nintroduced ideas that have profoundly affected the development of\nlogic.\n",
