    "main_text": "Political Convictions\n3. Political Convictions\n\n Rehberg formed his political convictions early, long before the\nRevolution.  Like all the Hannoverians, the inspiration for his\npolitics came from the British\n constitution.[31]\n\nHannoverian admiration for the British constitution is not surprising,\ngiven that Britian had long standing dynastic relations with the House\nof Hannover.  But there were other sources for this admiration, all of\nthem, ironically, perfectly French.  Rehberg and the Hannoverians had\nread their Voltaire, Montesquieu and Jean Louis De Lolme, who had all\npraised the English constitution, making it their model for modern\ngovernment and their antidote to absolutism.  Like their French\nforbears, the Hannoverians admired the British constitution for its\nmixture of modern freedom and ancient institutions.  The British had\npreserved their monarchy, their aristocracy and the ancient role of\nParliament as a representative institution; but they had also\nliberalized these institutions by granting toleration, freedom of\nspeech, and the right of commoners to hold office and participate in\ngovernment.  The great strength of the British constitution, in the\nHannoverian view, is that it served as a bulwark against the two chief\ndangers of the modern political world: radical democracy and monarchic\nabsolutism.  The British constitution wisely limited the franchise to\nthe aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie, which saved their system from\nochlocracy; but it also ensured that the king had to govern with the\nco-operation of parliament.  Contrary to Montesquieu and De Lolme,\nhowever, the Hannoverians did not see the balance of power, the system\nof checks and balances, as the reason for the success of the British\nsystem; they found it instead in the British party system, which\nthey admired for two grounds: it organized politicans into effective\ngroups in behalf of the public good, and it avoided corruption and\ncomplacency through\n opposition.[32]\n\n\n Although Rehberg's conservative views were formed before the\nRevolution, his early reaction to events in France was not hostile.\nHe was sympathetic to the moderate French reformers in the National\nAssembly, and he was hostile to royalists who insisted that France\nreturn to the days of absolute rule.  Unlike Burke, he refused to\nwhitewash the ancien r\u00e9gime, and he fully recognized\nthat, before the Revolution, France had been in desperate need of\nsocial and political reform.  Its taxes fell heavily on the poor, its\naristocrats had undeserved privileges, and its monarchs had ruled by\nwhim.  Like all the Hannoverians, Rehberg's great hope was that France\nwould evolve toward something like the British constitution, that it\nwould become something like a Parliament along the Seine.  He knew\nthat France and Britian were very different societies, having\ndifferent languages, traditions and values, and that it was impossible\nfor one country to adopt wholesale the constitution of another.\nNevertheless, he still hoped that the Estates General could become\nsomething like the British parliament.  If only\nFrench aristocrats could be more like their British cousins, and if\nonly Louis XVI could be persuaded to limits his powers like George\nIII.  When, however, it became clear that the Constituent Assembly was\nbent on more radical democratic and egalitarian changes, Rehberg's\nsympathy transformed into antipathy.  His opposition became resolute,\neven passionate, when he saw that the French were ready to import\nthese radical changes into Germany.  \n\n Despite his implacable hostility to radical democracy and\negalitarianism, Rehberg's general stance toward the Revolution, as\nthat of the Hannoverians in general, is best described as reform\nconservatism.  Its task was to walk the fine middle path between\nrevolution and reaction.  Rehberg disapproved of the reactionaries in\nGermany no less than the revolutionaries in France.  He realized that\nthe expectations aroused by the Revolution made it impossible to\nreturn to the old authoritarian ways.[33]\n\nThe only means to preserve the old order against revolutionary ferment\nwas through timely reforms.  Reform from above should placate and\ndampen the revolutionary demands coming from below.  The best way\nforward, he believed, was for the German Kleinstaat to evolve\nin the direction of the English Parliament.  The estates should become\nagain what they had been in the medieval past: representative bodies\nthat could check the power of kings and serve the interests of the\npublic.  Given Rehberg's mistrust of democracy and egalitarianism, it\nis perhaps going too far to describe his reform program as \u201cone\nof constitutional advance under the disguise of antiquarian\n claims\u201d.[34]\n Nevertheless, when we consider his\nliberal values and contempt for reactionaries, it is necessary to\nadmit that there is some measure of truth to this description. \n\n Although Rehberg and the Hannoverians were eager to uphold the\ntraditional order against the radical currents of the Revolution, it\nis also important to be clear about just what kind of order they\nwanted to preserve.  They were sharply critical of the ancien\nr\u00e9gime of Friedrich II's Prussia and of Louis XVI's France.\nThey feared and condemned the despotic power of absolute monarchs,\nwhich they saw as threats to the traditional liberties of the\nestates. Their sympathies were for the pluralistic structure of the\nold Kleinstaat, where each locality or province had its\ntraditional laws and customs, and where the estates gave some degree\nof representation.  The Hannoverians saw the constitution of their own\nElectorate as the norm for the German Kleinstaat. In the late\neighteenth century the Electorate of Hannover still had a thriving\naristocracy, a pliable peasantry, and a still nascent middle class.\nThe government was still in the hands of the St\u00e4nde, i.e.,\ngoverning committees representing clergy, town and landed interests.\nIf these could only be reformed along the lines of the British\nParliament, Rehberg believed, German states would not have to fear the\nexcesses of absolutism or radical democracy.  \n\n The core of Rehberg's reform program came with his ideas about\nreforming the St\u00e4nde. In the past the\nSt\u00e4nde had been dominated by aristocratic cliques who were\nconcerned chiefly with their own interests rather than the public\ngood.  They would quarrel constantly with the princes to preserve\ntheir old privileges.  The best positions were held by aristocrats,\nwho alone had voting rights.  Despite these defects, Rehberg believed\nthat the St\u00e4nde still had a valuable role to perform in\nthe modern state, and that it would be a disaster to replace them with\na bureaucracy.  Whereas a bureacracy fostered a spirit of obedience\nand order, the St\u00e4nde were open to discussion and debate\nabout the public interest.  Its members were not beholden to a\nmonarch, but the interests of their locality and constituency.  If the\nSt\u00e4nde were to survive in the modern era, they would have\nto respond more directly to their constituency, work more\nco-operatively with the monarch, and hold regular meetings to discuss\nand debate public affairs.  Most importantly, they would have to be\naccessible to the bougeoisie as well as the aristocracy, so that men of\ntalent could have the opportunity to rise to the top.  Although\nRehberg wanted the St\u00e4nde to be more representative\ninstitutions, he still wanted to limit access to them.  He feared\ndirect representation of people\u2014the slippery slope toward the dreaded\nuniversal franchise\u2014 and advocated representation on the basis of\nproperty.  His chief demand for reform is that\nLandstandschaft\u2014the right to participate and vote in\ncommittees\u2014be extended to anyone who owned land and not simply to the\ntraditional aristocracy.  Hence a bourgeois purchaser of traditional\naristocratic land could now be accepted into the St\u00e4nde.\nSuch a proposal is very modest and cautious; but it was also intended\nonly for the near future; for Rehberg also advocated, though for the\nmore distant future, the participation of the peasantry in the\n estates.[35]\n\n\nPrima facie it is strange to find Rehberg, a burgher whose\ntalents were thwarted by the aristocracy, to be such an advocate of\nits preservation.  It seems as if he were a humble and obedient\nservant in his politics as well as in his bureacratic work.  Yet\naristocracy was fundamental to Rehberg's whole political outlook.\nAristocracy was natural for him, given his insistence that rights and\nobligations are inherited, handed down from one generation to another\n(see below, section 4).  More importantly, aristocracy was his bulwark\nagainst major fears: democracy and egalitarianism.  The chief danger\nto democracy is that it could lead to ochlocracy, government by the\nmob.  It was axiomatic for Rehberg that all government had to be\nmeritocratic, and he could see no way of ensuring this principle in a\nradically democratic and equalitarian society.  He believed firmly in\nthe value of a social and political hierarchy, the importance of\nmaintaining class differences between\n people.[36]\n Class\ndifferences were in his view both desirable and inevitable: desirable,\nbecause they allow merit to rule; and inevitable, because people have\nmore or less merit or talent according to circumstances, temperament\nand birth.  \n",
