    "main_text": "Physical Theory || God\n2.7 God\n\nIn accord with their ontology, the Stoics make God a corporeal entity,\nidentical with the active principle. God is further characterized as\neternal reason (logos: Diogenes Laertius, 44B) or intelligent\ndesigning fire or breath (pneuma) which structures matter in\naccordance with its plan (Aetius, 46A). The Stoic God is thus immanent\nthroughout the cosmos and directs its development down to the smallest\ndetail. The entire cosmos is a living thing, and God stands to the\ncosmos as an animal\u2019s life force stands to the animal\u2019s\nbody, enlivening, moving and directing it by its presence throughout.\nThe designing fire is likened to sperm or seed which contains the\nfirst principles or directions of all the things which will\nsubsequently develop (Diogenes Laertius, 46B; Aristocles in Eusebius,\n46G). This makes cosmic nature and all its parts inherently governed\nby a rational force. God and divine actions are not, like the gods of\nGreek Mythology, random and unpredictable. It is rather orderly,\nrational, and providential. The association of God with\npneuma may have its origins in medical theories of the\nHellenistic period: see Baltzly 2003 and Annas 1992. On the issue of\nGod and its relation to the cosmos in Stoicism, see the essays in\nSalles 2009.\n",
