Existential Phenomenology, the Social World and Historical Time\n\nThe individual thus lives in an active and disclosing way. The\ndisclosure concerns first and foremost the individual himself or\nherself. The individual basically understands his or her own being, an\nunderstanding which, according Ortega, does not belong to the common\nlife of man in general; rather, it belongs solely to each unique\nindividual (Obras, VI: 25). It is only within his or her own\nfactual existence that the individual can fathom \u201cI am I and my\ncircumstances\u201d. The individuation of the individual\u2019s being is\nthat which identifies what he or she may become. If the\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d of the individual connote, for Ortega, any\nsituation toward which an act may be directed by the \u201cI\u201d,\nthen circumstances, for the most part, constitute more a condition,\nand not a denial, of the individual\u2019s freedom of action. That is to\nsay, once it is established that freedom entails choice, a choice must\nbe made with respect to the variety of possibilities which arise out\nof the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of the individual. To create his\ndestiny so that he may become \u201cthe novelist of himself\u201d,\nthe individual \u201cmust choose among these possibilities\u201d.\n\u201cTherefore\u201d, Ortega argued, \u201cI am free. But\nunderstand it well, I am free by coercion, whether I want to be or\nnot\u201d. The conditions of freedom evolve within given alternatives\nand freedom of action, and thereby result in the ability to choose and\nact under whatever confronting circumstances that may arise. Thus, for\nOrtega, how an individual constitutes himself or herself becomes\ndetermined very much by the way in which one allows for the possession\nof his or her being. The individual has not chosen freely his or her\n\u201ccircumstances;\u201d nevertheless, each can freely take over\nthe responsibility of his or her being and allow it to disclose itself\nas uniquely his or hers. \u201cMan\u2019s destiny, then\u201d, he\nposited, \u201cis primarily action. We do not live to think, on the\ncontrary: we think in order that we may succeed in surviving\u201d\n(Obras, VI: 34; 5: 304). For once given his life, man\u2019s being\nor essence becomes an ever-changing reality. As man\u2019s essence becomes\ncharacterized in conjunction with the conditions of his\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d, individual man is placed into and\ndelivered over to the being which is his and which he has to be. In\nthis manner, the burden of action and decision-making is placed upon\nthe individual as the very essence of one\u2019s being consists in an\never-changing reality in the making. One\u2019s ability to be this or that\nbeing is contingent upon his or her actions, and thus for Ortega, the\nindividual is fundamentally different from animals and stones:\n\nThis life that is given to us is given to us empty, and man has to go\non filling it for himself, occupying it. Such is our occupation. This\nis not the case with the stone, the plant, and the animal. Their being\nis given already to them predetermined and resolute\u2026But man is\ngiven the necessity of having to be doing something always, upon pain\nof succumbing, yet what he has to do is not present to him from the\noutset and once and for all. Because the most strange and most\nconfounding thing about this circumstance or world in which we have to\nlive consists in the fact that it always presents to us, within its\ninexorable circle or horizon, a variety of possibilities for our\naction, a variety in the face of which we are obliged to choose and,\ntherefore, to exercise our freedom. The circumstance\u2014I\nrepeat\u2014the here and now within which we are inexorably inscribed\nand imprisoned, does not at each moment impose on us a single act or\nactivity but various possible acts or activities and cruelly leaves us\nto our own initiative and inspiration, hence to our own responsibility\n(Obras, VII: 102\u201303).\n\nExistentialist philosophers are noted for their emphasis on freedom of\naction and the necessity for the individual to choose what he or she\nwill be; it becomes apparent, from the above statement, that Ortega\nhas absorbed this intellectual tradition into his own philosophy.\nClearly, other philosophers have been concerned with the nature of\nhuman freedom preceding the philosophical activity in Europe from the\nlate 1920s to the 1950s. However, the central interest which unites\nOrtega and existential philosophy concerns not only the issue of human\nfreedom, but also an emphasis on the experience and practice of it.\nThis being the case, the essence of man\u2019s being takes on a dual\ncharacteristic in Ortega\u2019s philosophy of human life, the\ndifferentiation between the internal trait of the individual\u2014the\n\u201cI\u201d\u2014and its external manifestation within the\nenvironment of physical entities. He views the \u201cI\u201d both as\nconstituting and as being constituted by the tangible reality of the\nworld. Life as the confrontation of the \u201cI\u201d with its\nenvironment\u2014environments in which various possibilities\nexist\u2014places man outside himself. As we observed,\n\u201cpossibility\u201d connotes, for Ortega, that which possesses\npotential actuality (from the viewpoint of the individual\u2019s\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d). From this point of view of the\ncircumstantialities of life, taking into account the \u201cI\u201d\nas the prime human reality is not sufficient unto itself since the\nrealization of this factor of life spurs the individual into action\nand thereby confronts him or her with external reality\n(Obras, V: 72\u201373). Thus, continual confrontation with\nhis \u201ccircumstances\u201d demonstrates the essential factor that\nprevents the individual from being isolated, locked in his or her ego.\nThe individual must act in life and, under such conditions, the living\nexperience becomes a task and the individual becomes what the\npotential possibilities of his or her finite being exhibit him or her\nto be.\n\nThe essential finitude of the individual is experienced at the very\nheart of life itself. \u201cLife is anguish\u201d, he remarked,\n\u201cand enthusiasm and delight and bitterness and innumerable\nthings\u201d. According to Ortega, at a certain point during his or\nher experience, the individual may plunge into the mood of\nanxiety\u2014as if he or she were \u201cbetween the sword and the\nwall\u201d\u2014when death becomes imminent. \u201cDeath\u201d, he\ncontinued, \u201cis certain, there is no escaping it! Could there be\nless choice?\u201d (Obras, VIII: 297; VII: 104). Ortega\nperceived the reality and the fact of death as essential in revealing\nthe very essence and contingency of the individual\u2019s being, which\nresembles similar views expressed by Heidegger. For, in the face of\n\u201cpossible death\u201d, to experience life as being also implies\nan awareness of the possibility of life as not being. The acceptance\nof death, therefore, as a possible here-and-now discloses the\nradical\u2014basic\u2014finitude of human life.\n\nThe perceptible factual occurrence of death also characterizes human\nlife as an occurrence of time as well as reality. As the individual\nbecomes aware of the reality of death, through experience, his or her\nfiniteness discloses itself essentially in time:\n\n\nOur vital knowledge of other men and of ourselves is open knowledge\nthat is never stable\u2026. Our vital knowledge is open, floating\nbecause the theme for this knowledge, life, Man, is already in itself\na being ever open to new possibilities.\n\nOur past undoubtedly weighs on us; it inclined us to be more this than\nthat in the future, but it does not chain us nor drag us\u2026. Life\nis change; it is at every new moment becoming something distinct from\nwhat it was, therefore, it never becomes definitely itself.\nOnly death, by preventing any new change, changes man into the\ndefinitive and immutable himself\u2026from the moment we begin to\nbe, death may intervene into the very substance of our life,\ncollaborate in it, compress it and densify it, may make it urgency\nimminence and the need of doing our best at every instant.\n(Obras, VII: 186\u201387)\n\n\nThis characterization of human life, then, posits the notion that time\nis in man, for the events in men\u2019s lives are related by their position\nin time. \u201cI am I and my circumstances\u201d, as the starting\npoint of the human condition, also expresses the fact that the living\nexperience of the individual consists of something that takes place\ntemporally as well as spatially. What does \u201cI am I and my\ncircumstances\u201d imply, then, in this sense? Ortega\u2019s emphasis on\nman as a being-that-lives-in-the-world may suggest something like a\npurpose, an end; however, a specific end was never his intended\npurpose. The here-and-now of the individual becomes his primary\nconcern. Indeed, he tended to define individuals\u2019\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d in terms of \u201ccertain elemental,\nbasic phenomena that involve human society\u201d and that in actual\nfact imposes themselves from the outside on the historical process\nthat he theoretically followed from within. As the temporality of man\nis very much a part of the here-and-now, man\u2019s being-in-the-making,\nfor Ortega, constitutes a \u201chappening\u201d toward the future.\nThe future is not-here-yet and the past is no-longer-here and these\ntwo features tend to permeate the very center of man\u2019s being as their\npositions are related to each other in time. As death relates to the\nindividual\u2019s internal finitude, the past and present relate to his or\nher finitude in its external, temporal manifestation. The\npresent\u2014the here-and-now\u2014becomes understood as that moment\nduring which the past and future are divided. The life of the present\nmoment\u2014when \u201csome men are born and when some men\ndie\u201d\u2014in its very essence \u201cis boxed in\u201d, Ortega\naverred, \u201cbetween other lives which came before or which are to\ncome after\u2026\u201d (Obras, V: 35\u201337). Once an\nindividual becomes aware of himself or herself as a being based on the\nfacts of his or her past (such facts as where one was born or who\none\u2019s parents were), and also as projected towards the future which he\nor she chooses, the individual will assume full responsibility for his\nor her life and choices. Ortega viewed the future as the more\nimportant aspect of temporality because it is the \u201copen\narea\u201d toward which man directs himself and in which man\nmanifests his own being. The individual directs himself or herself\ntoward the future and, accordingly, takes upon himself or herself the\ninheritance of the past, thereby becoming oriented to his or her\nactual and present predicament. In short, the present originates from\nthe past so as to engender the future.\n\nOrtega\u2019s schematization of the past, present and future is sustained\nin the unity of a temporality that assumes peculiar features in the\nexperience of the individual\u2019s vital dimensions. Through living\nexperiences, \u201cman goes on being and un-being\u201d. Hence, the\ntemporal experience of living is not structured in a one-dimensional\nprogression. Rather, as a continual process of being and not-being, it\nhas to be viewed from the three-dimensional perspective of past,\npresent and future. The individual reflects upon the past as he or she\nconfronts continually the situation of having to make conscious\ndecisions with respect to the present and the future. As we have\nlearned, life, death, free choice, and finitude dwell together in the\nliving experiences of individuals. Man\u2019s choice and\n\u201cdestiny\u201d, then, are contemporaneous\u2014embedded in the\nhere-and-now. Accordingly, the contemporaneity of man presupposes the\nauthentic temporality of man:\n\n\nThe past is the moment of identity in man, the inexorable and fatal.\nBut, for the same reason, if man\u2019s only Eleatic being is what\nhe has been, this means that his authentic being, what, in effect, he\nis\u2014and not merely \u201chas been\u201d\u2014is distinct from\nthe past, and consists precisely and formally in \u201cbeing what one\nhas not been\u201d, in non-Eleatic being. And since the term\n\u201cbeing\u201d is occupied irresistibly by its traditional static\nsignification, one should agree to liberate oneself of it. Man is not,\nsave the he \u201cgoes on being\u201d this and that.\n(Obras, VI: 39)\n\n\nAuthentic being, thus understood, has its essential weight not solely\nin the past, nor in the future, but in the individual\u2019s\nhere-and-now\u2014the present in its reflexive connection with the\npast. Hence, as an authentic being, man is as contemporary as he is\nhistorical, and thereby the historicity of man makes explicit the\ntemporal manifestations of his vital dimensions.\n\nThrough the \u201cI\u201d and its \u201ccircumstances\u201d,\nOrtega balanced the principle of individual variety with his\nphilosophy of human life. However, in considering the individual to be\na historical being occasioned by his or her temporality, Ortega began\nto pursue a line of thought that would eventually position him to\nestablish a principle of coherence for the realities of the\nindividual, society and history; this theme would be borne out of the\nphenomenological thrust of Ortega\u2019s philosophy of human society and\nhis theory of generations. For life, as the process of happening and\nthe temporality of the individual, makes implicit the assumption that\n\u201cman goes on being\u201d and thus has a discernible principle\nof coherence.\n\nOnce human life has been established as the fundamental standpoint of\nreality, for Ortega,\n\n\nwe are ipso facto given two terms or factors that are equally\nprimary and, moreover, inseparable: Man, who lives, and the\ncircumstances or world in which man lives.\n\n\nAs a being that lives, the individual relates to other living beings.\nFor Ortega, \u201call realities must in some way make themselves\npresent, or at least announce themselves within the shaken boundaries\nof our human life\u201d (Obras, VII: 101). Hence, the basic\nreality of human life constitutes the life of an individual with the\nlives of other individuals as well as situations that pertain to the\nconfrontation of the individual with the existent realities of\nphysical objects. In accordance with this viewpoint, man\u2014as a\nbeing-that-lives-in-the-world\u2014does not perceive the world from\nthe isolation of his ego, for the very essence of his being consists\nin living in an actively disclosing manner. For Ortega,\nbeing-in-the-world has a dual characteristic: as it relates to\n\u201cI am I\u201d, being-in-the-world functions as\nbeing-for-itself; but as it relates to \u201cmy circumstances\u201d,\nbeing-in-the-world functions as being-for-and-with-others. \u201cOur\nworld\u201d, he explained,\n\n\nthe world of each one of us, is not totum revolutum, but is\norganized in \u201cpragmatic fields\u201d. Each thing belongs to one\nor some of these fields, in which it articulates its\nbeing-for with that of others, and so on successively.\n(Obras, VII: 130)\n\n\nThrough an approach reminiscent of Kant and Husserl, Ortega posited\nthe fact that \u201call men live in one and the same world\u201d. He\ncontinued,\n\n\nThis is the attitude that we may call the natural, normal and everyday\nattitude in which we live; and, because of it, because of living\nwith others in a presumed world\u2014hence our\nworld\u2014our living is co-living, living together.\n(Obras, VII: 152)\n\n\nAny meaningful interaction with the other \u201cconsists in my\nrelation with becoming active, in my acting on him and his on me. In\npractice, the former usually follows upon the latter\u201d. In this\nmanner, then, the discovery of the body of the other, as an object in\nreality, becomes a reverse revelation of the \u201cI\u201d and its\nbeing. The being which is subsequently revealed to the \u201cI\u201d\nis revealed as being-for-and-with-others. This component of\nbeing-for-itself-and-others is an integral part of being-in-the-world\nand being-for-itself and, thereby provided Ortega with the\nphenomenological perspective through which he developed his idea of\nindividuals interacting in human society. He explains:\n\n\nThis means that the appearance of the Other is a fact that always\nremains as it were at the back of our life, because on becoming aware\nfor the first time that we are living, we already find ourselves, not\nonly with others and among others, but accustomed to others. Which\nleads us to formulate this first social theorem: Man is a\nnativitate open to the other, to the alien being; or, in\nother words: before each one of us became aware of himself,\nhe had already had the basic experience that there are others who are\nnot \u201cI\u201d, the Others; that is to say, again, Man, on being\na nativitate open to the other, to the alter who is\nnot himself is a nativitate, like it or not\u2026. Being\nopen to the other, to others, is a permanent and constitutive state of\nMan, not a definite action in respect to them. \u2026 This state is\nnot yet properly a \u201csocial relation\u201d, because it is not\nyet defined in any concrete act. It is simple co-existence, matrix for\nall possible \u201csocial relations\u201d. It is simple presence\nwithin the horizon of my life\u2014a presence which is, above all,\nmore compresence of the Other, singular or plural. (Obras,\nVII: 149\u201350)\n\n\nFor Ortega, framing the social world as a horizon connotes, as it\ndid for Husserl, the context in which the experience of human\ninteraction (among \u201cI\u201d, and \u201cWe\u201d and\n\u201cOther\u201d) occurs. The various \u201cI\u2019s\u201d constitute\nthe fundamental units of the structure and content of the social\nworld. \u201cHusserl says very well\u201d, Ortega recalled,\n\u201cthe meaning of the term man implies a reciprocal\nexistence of one for the other, hence, a community of men, a\nsociety\u201d (Obras, VII: 148). As we saw previously,\nin describing reality, Ortega postulated the distinction between\nthings (i.e., plants, stones and animals) and man through the fact\nthat things exist and man lives. By dint of the unique qualities\nof human existence, the individual possesses an essence that is\npeculiarly one\u2019s own, which means that humans are not\nonly split off from nature\u2014plants, stones, minerals and the\nlike. All individual human acts, for Ortega, are directed toward some\nobject and, as such, the actions of the individual are manifested in\naccord with the nature of the objects toward which they are directed\nand in accord with their physical, spatial context. If the object is a\nstone, the individual\u2019s actions would be unilateral; however, if the\nobject is an animal, an individual discovers that his or her\nactions would be manifested toward an anticipated reaction by the\nanimal to which they are directed:\n\n\nWe know that a stone is not aware of our action on it\u2026. But as\nsoon as we begin dealing with an animal, the relation changes\u2026.\nThere is, then, no doubt that, in my relation with the animal, the act\nof my behavior toward it is not, as it was in the case of the stone,\nunilateral; rather, my act, before being performed, when I am planning\nit, already calculates with the probable act of reaction on the\nanimal\u2019s part, in such a manner that my act, even in the state of pure\nproject, moves toward the animal but returns to me in an inverted\nsense, anticipating the animal\u2019s reply. (Obras, VII:\n133\u201334)\n\n\nWe find this sort of transcendental reflection\u2014by way of action,\nresponses and reciprocal responses\u2014to be fundamental in the kind\nof description made by Ortega of the social world. With an animal as\nan object toward which individuals  direct\ntheir actions, one finds more of a reciprocal response than\noccurs with stones and other inanimate objects.\nAn individual and an animal, according to Ortega,\nexist-for-each-other but not to the same degree as between man and\nman;  the latter relate to one another as\nbeing-with-and-for-the-other. Yet the question remains: what kind of\nbehavior can be constituted as being social and what are the\ncontingencies implicit in this behavior? The contingency, for Ortega,\nrelates to the fact that social behavior entails interaction between\nindividuals, in contrast to acts between individuals and\nanimals\u2014 human life remains the ultimate\nreality\u2014and this human interaction has to be reciprocal. It is a\nkind of reciprocity of action that can only arise and occur amongst\nhumans:\n\n\nDoes not the word \u201csocial\u201d immediately point to a reality\nconsisting in the fact that man conducts himself in confrontation with\nother beings which, in their turn, conduct themselves with respect to\nhim\u2014therefore, to actions in which, in one way or another, the\nreciprocity intervenes\u2026in short, to say the same thing in\nanother way, that the two actors mutually respond to each other, that\nis, they correspond? (Obras, VII: 135\u201337)\n\n\n Upon experiencing the others as other individuals, Ortega\nmaintains,  the \u201cI\u201d understands and relates to them\nas modalities that are analogous to the \u201cI\u201d and are\ninextricably connected, as fundamental units of human reality, to\ntheir \u201ccircumstances\u201d as well. This interaction manifests\nitself in such a manner that the \u201cI\u201d, for Ortega,\napprehends the world-about-the-others and the\nworld-about-the-\u201cI\u201d as one and the same world\u2014from\nan objective, empirical standpoint\u2014that differs in each\nindividual case only insofar as it affects consciousness differently.\nFor we all perceive reality through our sense-perception, albeit our\nindividual perceptions of this very reality are registered\ndifferently. For Ortega, as we have seen, I am the only one who is an\n\u201cI\u201d. All the other \u201cI\u2019s\u201d are similar to\nobjects (in the sense that they are perceived solely as physical\norganisms) and, once viewed as being \u201can other\nperson\u201d (that is, a being perceived as possessing both a\nbody and an inwardness, an other \u201cI\u201d), are\nreferred to as the \u201cothers\u201d. My own place in this\nworld\u2014in time and space\u2014is related to my \u201cI\u201d\nand my body. Therefore, when the \u201cego\u201d (which is my\n\u201cI\u201d) encounters an \u201calien ego\u201d, it is\nessential for it (the \u201cego\u201d) to transcend itself and\nthereby make possible meaningful attempts to understand and perceive\nthe existence of other \u201cegos\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019s\u201d. The\nOther, as \u201cI\u201d, according to Ortega, embodies an\n\u201cego\u201d that possesses a similar quality of consciousness,\ninwardness and solitude: an ego that will be regarded as also\npossessing both primary and secondary modal qualities and whose\nfundamental essence and structure will also be encountered as existent\nwithin the \u201cI\u201d. Thus, for Ortega, in order to attempt to\nenter this sphere of the \u201cother\u2019s inwardness\u201d, it becomes\nessential to strive toward attaining the transcendental attitude.\n\u201cIn this sense of radical reality\u201d, he explained,\n\n\n\u201chuman life\u201d means strictly and exclusively the life of\neach individual, that is, always and only my life\u2026. If, by\nchance\u2014I added\u2014appears in this my world something that\nmust also be called \u201chuman life\u201d in another sense, neither\nradical nor primary nor patent, but secondary, derivative and more or\nless latent and hypothetical\u2026 What is decisive in this step and\nin this appearance is that when my life and everything in it, on being\npatent to me, on being mine, have immanent character\u2014hence the\ntruism that my life is immanent to itself, that it is all within\nitself\u2014the indirect presentation, or compresence, of the alien\nhuman life startles and confronts me with something transcendent to my\nown life\u2026. (Obras, VII: 141)\n\n\nThrough the mediacy of a human world, then, the \u201cI\u201d and\nthe Other, communicate as collective human lives. The radical reality\nof the \u201cI\u201d, as the inwardness of human life, is unique to\nthe individual \u201cI\u201d, and, to the extent possible, relates\ntranscendentally to the \u201cI\u201d of the other. The\nconsciousness of the \u201cI\u201d becomes separated from the\nconsciousness of the other by the very distinction that separates, in\nthe first instance, the \u201cI\u2019s\u201d consciousness of its own\nbody, and secondly, the distinction that separates the body of the\n\u201cI\u201d from the body of the other, and finally, the\ndistinction that separates the other\u2019s body from its consciousness.\nAlternatively, the bodies of the \u201cI\u201d and the other, as\nexistent physical structures in the common world of \u201chuman\nlives\u201d, are necessary \u201cbroadcasting centers\u201d, as\nOrtega calls it, between the consciousness of the \u201cI\u201d and\nthe others. In this connection, the relations between the bodies of\nthe \u201cI\u201d and the Other consists of a relation of\ntranscendental exteriority. \u201cWhat is certainly patent in my\nlife\u201d, he explained,\n\n\nis the notification, the signal, that there are other human lives; but\nsince human life in its radicality is only mine, and these\nwill be lives of others like myself, each the life of each, it follows\nthat, because they are others, all their lives will be situated\noutside of or beyond or trans-mine. Hence they are\ntranscendent. (Obras, VII: 142)\n\n\nExpressed in this manner, the individual, as a\nbeing-who-lives-in-the-world and as a being-for-and-with-others, is an\nempirically finite being who has to transcend the finitude of his\n\u201cradical reality\u201d. As we have seen, from the perspective\noften associated with existential philosophy, Ortega averred that for\nthe individual to transcend the determinacy of one\u2019s being and to\nattain individual consciousness, an individual  has to make\nfree choices and decisions. From an ontological point of view, Ortega\nmakes a case, like Husserl, for the necessity of entering the\ntranscendental attitude so that an individual may bring oneself\ncloser to an understanding and consciousness of the experience of the\n\u201cother\u201d. The phenomenological and existential philosophies\nare thus linked together, for the individual remains an empirical,\nfinite, concrete, and unique being in his particular\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d who has been placed decisively within the\nspatiotemporal context in the here-and-now of one\u2019s world, and\nthrough this perspective, one transcends\none\u2019s \u201cradical reality\u201d in its every detail\n(Obras, V: 545\u201347). Although he called into question\nthe \u201cabstract analogical transposition\u201d of Husserl\u2019s\n\u201ctranscendental reduction\u201d, Ortega\u2019s phenomenological\napproach to the importance of transcending individual\nexperience\u2014as the fundamentals basis for understanding the very\nexperience of reality\u2014still remains very much within the\ntradition of Husserl,  his students, and followers\nthroughout disparate phases of the phenomenological method:\nHeidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. When Ortega\npresented the ontological ramifications of reality, clearly he\nconsidered the human body to be connected to the totality of what he\ncalled human life or radical reality and, as such, to be the\nfoundation of its vital structure. More specifically: the body is a\nbody of an individual insofar as it exists in the indissoluble unity\nof its radical reality. But, he questioned, \u201cwhat do we mean\nwhen we say that an Other is before us, that is, an other like myself,\nanother Man?\u201d His answer,\n\n\n\u2026I, ego, means for us no more than \u201chuman life\u201d,\nand human life\u2026is properly, originally, and radically only the\nlife of each of us, hence, my life. (Obras, VII:\n158\u201359)\n\n\nTo some, it would appear to be an obvious fact that individuals\nare able to understand others, in their being and essence, both\nas alike and other than themselves. From a phenomenological\nstandpoint, however, this fact is a problem which is neither obvious\nnor easy to explain, and it is a problem whose solution was viewed\ndifferently by both Ortega and Husserl. For Husserl, the solution to\nthis problem was found in his notion of Einf\u00fchlung\n(\u201cempathy\u201d, or literally, \u201cfeeling oneself into\nanother\u201d). Husserl\u2019s concept of the Einf\u00fchlung in\nLebenswelt resembles David Hume\u2019s idea of\n\u201csympathy\u201d, and its philosophical function (as a\npropensity \u201cto sympathize with others\u201d, and as a\n\u201ctranscendental theory of experiencing someone else\u201d) was\nintended to establish, as thoroughly as possible, a way of presenting\nthe \u201cother\u201d to us. (see Hume 1739 [1985: 367\u201369]).\nOrtega renounced the supposition inherent in this solution to the\nproblem because the notion of Einf\u00fchlung\nassumes the \u201cother\u201d is \u201canalogous\u201d to my\n\u201cI\u201d; the concept assumes that it is a double of\nmy \u201cI\u201d and still fails to serve the function of\nexplaining the most difficult question\u2014namely, how is it\npossible that this \u201cdouble\u201d of myself continues to appear\nto me as constituting the other? The main thrust of Ortega\u2019s argument\nis directed against Husserl\u2019s formulation, in Cartesian\nMeditations, of the alter ego as \u201can\nanalogue\u201d of the ego. The solution of \u201can analogical\ntransposition or projection\u201d, therefore proved inadequate for\nOrtega, and the notion of the \u201cappearance of the Other\u201d\nbecame the problem to which he extended his\nexistential-phenomenological position of being-for-itself and\nbeing-for-and-with-others. In order to clarify somewhat the\nproblem, Ortega replaced Husserl\u2019s notion of \u201cin [my] every\nintentionality\u201d with his own idea of \u201cmy life as\nradical reality\u201d (see especially Husserl 1933 [1964:\n89\u2013100, 104\u201311]; ZPI: vol. 14, 3\u201311, 429\u201333;\nvol. 15, 40\u201350; see also, Scheler 1923 [1954: 6\u201350];\nObras, VII: 161\u201363). As the individual is never a\nwordless \u201cI\u201d\u2014for, as radical reality his life is\nbeing-in-the-world\u2014also one is never an isolated\n(Other-less) \u201cI\u201d. For Ortega, this manifestation of\n\u201cradical realty\u201d constitutes the fundamental feature of\nbeing-for-and-with-others and consequently cannot be explained as an\nisolated \u201cI\u201d that somehow discovers a way of confronting\nanother equally isolated \u201cI\u201d. An individual does not\nhave to find his or her way to another individual for, with\nthe disclosure of one\u2019s own being as being-for-and-with-others,\nthe being of other \u201cI\u2019s\u201d becomes disclosed to one as\npossessing this identical feature:\n\n\nObserve then: being the other does not represent an accident or\nadventure that may or may not befall Man, but is an original\nattribute. I, in my solitude, could not call myself by a generic name\nlike \u201cman\u201d. The reality represented by this name appears\nto me only when there is another being who responds or reciprocates to\nme. Husserl says very well: \u201cThe meaning of the term\n\u2018man\u2019 implies a reciprocal existence of one for the other,\nhence a community of men, a society\u201d. And conversely:\n\u201cIt is equally clear that men cannot be apprehended unless there\nare (really or potentially) other men around them\u201d.\nHence\u2014I add\u2014to speak of man outside and apart from a\nsociety is to say something that is self-contradictory and\nmeaningless\u2026. Man does not appear in\nsolitude\u2014although his ultimate truth is solitude; man appears in\nsociality as the Other, frequenting the One, as the reciprocator\n(Obras, VII: 148).\n\n\nThe \u201cI\u201d and the other, then, are constituted by their\nappearance before each other, in the common world of society, and as\neach engages in reciprocal interaction. In this regard, Ortega was in\nbasic agreement with Husserl as the former attempted to reconcile the\nrealms of \u201cI\u201d and other, solitude and society, by\nestablishing the fact that a referral to the other (on the part of the\n\u201cI\u201d) is an indispensable condition for the constitution of\nbeing-in-the-world.\n\nThus, in the social world of being-for-and-with-others, an individual\ndirects oneself away from the possibilities that may be viewed as\nbeing exclusively one\u2019s own and attempts to broaden\nthe understanding of oneself by relating to the common world\npossibilities of others. The social world in which the individual\nlives\u2014as one who remains linked with other individuals through\nmanifold relations\u2014becomes a realm that the individual apprehends\nand interprets to be meaningful for one\u2019s own possibilities,\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d and  here-and-now. Adopting this\nstandpoint, Ortega contended that, as individuals who are rooted in\nour radical realities, we must \u201cmake an attempt at\ninterpenetration, at de-solitudinizing\nourselves\u2026\u201d (Obras, VII: 140). This being the\ncase, as the spatial-temporal dimension of an individual\u2019s radical\nreality become part and parcel of one\u2019s here-and-now, the reality\nof the social world (as the context and mediacy through which groups\nof individuals interact) is also enmeshed in their here-and-now.\nThrough one\u2019s own finitude, the individual\u2019s temporality\nreveals+ itself as the consciousness of the intrasubjective\nstructure of his life. The reality of the social world, conversely,\nreveals itself to the individual as an intersubjectively structured\nworld which the \u201cI\u201d shared through interacting\nwith others. The spatial-temporal manifestations of this\nintersubjectivity connect the \u201cI\u201d to the others and, at\nthe same time, sharply differentiate the world of the \u201cI\u201d\nfrom the social world of the others. \u201cThe first thing\u201d, he\nexplains,\n\n\nI fall foul of in my proper and radical world is Other Men, the Other\nsingular and plural, among whom I am born and begin to live. From the\nbeginning, then, I find myself in a human world or society.\n(Obras, VII: 177)\n\n\nIn the context of social reality, the individual therefore measures\none\u2019s \u201cI\u201d by what constitutes the Others and by what\nthey have achieved and failed to achieve in the social world. The\nexperience of the social world by an \u201cI\u201d thereby\njustifies and corroborates itself (as a being-in-the-world) through\nthe experience of the others with whom the \u201cI\u201d interacts.\nThe possibilities of  individuals and their subsequent\nunderstanding of themselves can be broadened after\ntheir encounter with the \u201cothers\u201d in the social\nworld common to all \u201cI\u2019s\u201d. However, Ortega also\nperceives the shared social world, in several aspects as\nconstricting, instead of  expanding, the individual\u2019s\npossibilities. As an empirically finite being whose radical reality\ncontinually confronts the possibility of death, the individual,\nfor Ortega, can make efforts to transcend the determinacy of\none\u2019s being by making, existentially, free choices and\ndecisions. Conversely, the individual, as a social,  empirically\nfinite being who, interrelated with other individuals, finds\nit difficult to transcend and recoil from the process of the\nreciprocity of human interaction in the context of social reality and,\nhence, becomes conditioned (by society) to act with a view toward what\nothers have done and currently are doing. Once given this social\nworld that may be interpreted to signify the possible realm of action\nfor all of us (as \u201call men find themselves among men\u201d), in\nOrtega\u2019s view, the individual must discriminate between what\nconstitutes the possibilities of  Others\u2014humans in\ngeneral in the social world\u2014and what constitutes the\npossibilities inherent in the uniqueness of his own finite being.\n\u201cWhat is yours\u201d, he states,\n\n\ndoes not exist for me\u2014your ideas and convictions do not exist\nfor me. I see them as alien and something as opposed to me\u2026.\nAll Yous are such\u2014because they are different from me\u2014and\nwhen I say I, I am only a minute portion of the world, the tiny part\nof it that I now begin accurately to call \u201cI\u201d.\n(Obras, VII: 178, 189\u201390)\n\n\nIn this connection, the individual must live neither as an isolated\n\u201cI\u201d nor as a conformist to the common social world of the\nothers. Rather, the individual must live the existence of a unique\n\u201cI\u201d. That is to say, the unique individual consists of\none who lives in an actively and disclosing manner and who has\nthe ability both to come out of and to withdraw into the possibilities\nwhich are permitted within the realm of the\n\u201cyous\u201d and \u201cwes\u201d that\none confronts in the reality of the social world. \u201cIt is in\nthe world of the yous, and by virtue of them\u201d, he\nelaborates,\n\n\nthat the thing I am, my I, gradually takes shape for me. I discover\nmyself, then, as one of countless yous, but as different from\nthem all, with gifts and defects of my own, with a unique character\nand conduct, that together draw my authentic and correct profile for\nme\u2014hence as another and particular you, as alter tu.\n(Obras, VII: 196)\n\n\nAt this point of our analysis, it becomes apparent that the term\n\u201csocial world\u201d, or society, for Ortega, connotes merely\nthe category which he utilized to describe the\nphenomenological interaction between individual \u201cI\u2019s\u201d both\nas unique individuals and as social individuals. In other words, the\nsocial world entails the realm in which the interactive process of the\n\u201cI\u201d and its \u201ccircumstances\u201d becomes extended\nto the inclusion of other \u201cI\u2019s\u201d. Departing from this\nperspective, Ortega became concerned with the fundamental patterns of\nhuman interaction that underlie the larger context of social reality.\nThe reduction of the whole of what constitutes social reality into its\ncomponent elements discloses the phenomenological grounding of\nOrtega\u2019s analysis of human society. Hence, the social relation of\nindividuals identifies the distinctive unity which is defined by the\nreciprocal interaction of its unique individual components. As he\nexplains:\n\n\n\u2026the basic structure that is social relation, in which man\nmoves appearing and defining himself in front of the other man, and\nfrom being the pure other, the unknown man, the not-yet-identified\nindividual, becomes the unique individual\u2014the You and I. But now\nwe have become aware of something that is a constituent factor in all\nthat we have called \u201csocial relation\u201d\u2026namely, that\nall these actions of ours and all these reactions of others in which\nthe so-called \u201csocial relation\u201d consists, originate in an\nindividual as such, I [myself] for example, and are directed to\nanother individual as such. Therefore, the \u201csocial\nrelation\u201d, as it has so far appeared to us, is always explicitly\na reality between individuals, a reality formally inter-individual.\n(Obras, VII: 202\u20133)\n\n",
