    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Epistemic value\n4.9 Epistemic value\n\nKnowledge tends to have good effects, at least when combined with\nbenevolence. Similarly, true belief tends to have good effects, while\nfalse belief tends to have bad effects. But some also hold that\nknowledge or belief or high confidence in true propositions is\nnon-instrumentally good (good for its own sake), and perhaps\nalso that belief or high confidence in false propositions is\nnon-instrumentally bad (see the entry on\n the value of knowledge).\n These evaluative claims sometimes go hand in hand with slogans like\n\u2018belief aims at the truth\u2019 and \u2018belief aims at\nknowledge\u2019, the thought being that the goodness of things that\nhave an aim or function consists in their achieving those aims or\nfulfilling those functions. \n\nOnce this starting point is granted, the question arises whether all\ntruths are equally non-instrumentally good to believe, and all\nfalsehoods equally bad. There is reason to think not: it would be a\nwarped kind of concern for the truth that led someone to memorise\nphone books rather than doing science, on the grounds that this is\nmore efficiently generates epistemic value. The concept of naturalness\nseems potentially useful in explaining which truths are most valuable\nto believe. Indeed, if we are willing to apply \u2018natural\u2019\nto propositions as well as properties, the following simple\ngeneralization looks tenable: the more natural a proposition is, the\nbetter it is to know it or believe it or have high confidence in it if\nit is true, and (one might add) the worse it is to believe it or have\nhigh confidence in it if it is false.\n\nSider\n (2011)\n gives pride of place to evaluative considerations in his discussion\nof naturalness: according to him, the fact that \u201cit\u2019s\nbetter to think and speak in joint-carving terms\u201d\nunifies many of the other roles for naturalness. He characterises\nnaturalness as a second \u201caim of belief\u201d, on a par with\ntruth. He furthermore holds that merely using words or concepts that\nstand for unnatural properties is (non-instruementally) bad, even when\nthere is no difference in the propositions believed. His thought is\nthat simply using such words or concepts, no matter what beliefs one\nforms, involves \u2018carving the world up\n incorrectly\u2019.[59]\n Dorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n argue against Sider\u2019s picture of naturalness as a value\nindependent of truth, on the grounds that believing a false natural\nproposition is worse than believing a false unnatural one,\nwhereas on Sider\u2019s account it should be better. For example, a\npill that induces many false beliefs about phone numbers should be\npreferred to one that will induce a single false belief about whether\nneutrinos have mass. They also claim that the value or disvalue in\nusing certain words or concepts is merely instrumental, flowing\nentirely from their tendencies to promote or hinder belief.\n\nThe idea that naturalness matters to epistemic value strikes some as\nmysterious. Dasgupta\n (2018)\n doubts that there is any more non-instrumental value in learning about the distribution\nof natural properties than in learning about the distribution of \nunnatural ones, on\nthe grounds that there would need to be some deeper explanation for\nsuch value-theoretic facts, and no adequate explanation is available.\nHis strategy is to consider some other feature of properties he calls\n\u201cgraturalness\u201d, which grueness is stipulated to have to a\nhigher degree than greenness. When the opponent attempts to explain\nthe evaluative importance of naturalness by appealing to some feature\nwhich naturalness necessarily has and graturalness necessarily lacks\n(e.g.\u00a0making for similarity), Dasgupta will respond by\nintroducing a corresponding \u201cgrueified\u201d feature which\ngraturalness necessarily has and naturalness necessarily lacks\n(e.g.\u00a0making for \u201cgrimilarity\u201d), and complain that\nthe explanatory challenge has merely been pushed back rather than met,\nsince we now need an explanation for the claim that the feature the\nopponent pointed to has an evaluative significance that its grueified\ncounterpart lacks. This strategy is extremely general: indeed, it is\nunclear whether any claim of non-instrumental value could be\nexplained in a way that would satisfy Dasgupta\u2019s criteria for\nadequate explanation.\n\nThose who take naturalness to correlate with epistemic value might\nconsider trying to define naturalness in value-theoretic\nterms. McDaniel\n (2017b)\n attempts something like this, although he appeals to the concept of\nobligation rather than value. He proposes that\nfor a property to be \u201cfundamental\u201d (i.e.\u00a0natural) is for there to be a prima facie\nobligation to form true beliefs about it. One challenge facing views\nalong these lines is that belief is an attitude to propositions,\nwhereas naturalness applies also to properties and relations. McDaniel\naddresses this challenge using a theory of propositions as structured\nentities: for being F to be more natural (to a certain\ndegree) than being G is for it to be the case that whenever\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are two true propositions differing only in that\nbeing F appears in a position in the structure of \\(p\\) where\nbeing G appears in the structure of \\(q\\), there is a\nstronger (by a certain degree) prima facie obligation to believe \\(p\\)\nthan to believe \\(q\\). Note that if this scheme worked, it could also\nused to recover naturalness comparisons for properties and relations\nfrom naturalness comparisons for propositions, independent of the\nconnection to obligation. But it is certainly not uncontroversial than\nthis can be done, even setting aside concerns about the consistency of\nthe required fine-grained theory of propositions. One might think that\nthe naturalness of a proposition turns on factors like the\ndiversity of its \u201cconstituents\u201d as well as the\nsum of their individual degrees of naturalness, so that substituting a\nless natural constituent for a more natural one might sometimes\nincrease the naturalness of a proposition by decreasing its diversity.\nFor example, the proposition that every grue gemstone is surrounded by\ngrue rock is not obviously less natural, or less valuable to believe if true, than the proposition\nthat every grue gemstone is surrounded by green rock.\n4.10 Definability\n\nThere are various logical operations which map some properties to\nothers. One property can be the negation of another, or the\nconjunction or disjunction of two or more others. A monadic property\ncan be the reflexivization of a binary relation; its existential or\nuniversal quantification in one or other of its argument places, or\nthe result of saturating one or other of its argument places with an\nobject: given the relation of loving, reflexivization yields\nloving oneself; quantification yields loving\nsomething, loving everything, being loved by\nsomething, and being loved by everything; while\nsaturation yields, for example, loving Socrates and being\nloved by Socrates. In each of these cases, let us say that the\noutput property is \u201cdefinable from\u201d the input properties\nand objects (taken collectively), and \u201cpartly definable\nfrom\u201d each of the input properties (individually). Let us also\nassume that partial definability is transitive.\n\nThese examples do not amount to definitions of \u2018definable\u2019\nand \u2018partly definable\u2019. Nevertheless, the notions seem\nclear enough for our present purpose, which is to consider how\ndefinability might relate to naturalness. Here are several\ngeneralizations one might find tempting:\n\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is less natural\nthan \\(q\\).\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is not perfectly\nnatural.\nIf \\(p\\) is not partly definable from any \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is\nperfectly natural.\n\n\nA worry about these proposals is that on some accounts, every property\nwill count as partly definable from itself. Then (1) will be\ninconsistent, (2) will entail that no property is perfectly natural,\nand (3) will be vacuously true. The claim that partial definability is\nreflexive might, for example, be motivated by the claim that every\nproperty is the negation of its negation. It might also be motivated,\nat least as far as relations are concerned, by the especially\nplausible claim that every binary relation is the converse of its\nconverse, together with the claim that the the converse of any\nrelation is partially definable from\n it.[60]\n\n\nThese worries do not apply to the corresponding generalizations about\nstrict partial definability, where \\(p\\) is strictly\npartially definable from \\(q\\) just in case \\(p\\) is partially\ndefinable from \\(q\\) and \\(q\\) is not partially definable from \\(p\\):\n\n\nIf \\(p\\) is strictly partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is less\nnatural than \\(q\\).\nIf \\(p\\) is strictly partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is not\nperfectly natural.\nIf \\(p\\) is not strictly partly definable from any \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is\nperfectly natural.\n\n\nAnd here are two other weakenings of (1) and (2) which are also not\ntrivialised even if partial definability is reflexive:\n\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is not more natural\nthan \\(q\\).\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\) and \\(p\\) is perfectly\nnatural, \\(q\\) is perfectly\n natural.[61]\n\n\nGeneralizations like 1\u20138 are interesting only against the\nbackground of a sufficiently fine-grained theory of properties. All\nare trivialised by intensionalism, the thesis that necessarily\ncoextensive properties are always identical. Consider the following\nconsequence of intensionalism:\n\n\n(D) being \\(F\\) is identical to\nbeing either \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) or \\(F\\) and not\n \\(G\\).[62]\n\n\n\nSince the conjunction and conjunction and disjunction of any two\nproperties count as partially definable out of each of those\nproperties and partial definability is transitive,\n (D)\n implies that every \\(n\\)-ary property is partially definable from\nevery other: being \\(F\\) is partly definable from being\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\), which is in turn partly definable from being\n\\(G\\). This makes (1) inconsistent; makes (2) imply that no\nproperty is perfectly natural; makes (3) and (6) imply that every\nproperty is perfectly natural; makes (4) and (5) vacuously true; makes\n(7) imply that all properties are equally natural; and makes (8) imply\nthat every property is perfectly natural if any are.\n\nIntensionalism is controversial, so the fact that it conflicts with\nour generalizations linking naturalness to definability is not by\nitself a big problem for the generalizations. But once intensionalism\nis denied, there is an urgent need for a systematic theory of\nproperties to replace it. For example: given that\n (D)\n is false for some \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), it would be good to know whether\nit is false for all of them. If so, are there more general principles\nwhich explain this? If not, what marks the difference between the\n\\(F\\), \\(G\\) pairs for which\n (D)\n is true and those for which it is false? Without a background theory\nto provide some guidance with these questions, generalizations linking\npartial definability to naturalness will be of little use: we can\nstill know in many cases that \\(p\\) is partially definable from \\(q\\),\nby knowing of some particular operations that can be applied to \\(q\\)\nto get \\(p\\), but it will be unclear how to argue for any claim of\nstrict partial definability. The task of coming up with a\nconsistent non-intensionalist theory strong enough to answer answer\nsuch questions is by no means straightforward. The most popular\nfine-grained picture holds that properties (and propositions) are\n\u201cstructured\u201d, where this is taken to imply that, for\nexample, bearing \\(R\\) to \\(a\\) is identical to bearing\n\\(S\\) to \\(b\\) only if \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are identical, and \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\) are identical. Unfortunately, when principles of this sort\nare spelled out in the higher-order logic mentioned in \u00a73.4\nabove, and generalized in the obvious way, they lead to an\ninconsistency: the \u201cRussell-Myhill paradox\u201d, first\nidentified in Russell\n 1903\n (appendix B), and subsequently rediscovered by Myhill\n (1958):\n see Goodman\n 2017\n and Dorr\n 2018\n (\u00a76). But this certainly is not the end of the story, even\nwithin the higher order framework. For example, Dorr\n (2016)\n develops a consistent non-intensionalist theory that entails that\n (D)\n is false for every \\(F\\) and\n \\(G\\).[63]\n\n\nOf course, even if one has a fine-grained view that makes partial\ndefinability discriminating enough to be interesting, one may have\nother reasons for rejecting generalizations like (1\u20138). Lewis\n (1970a;\n 1986b, 56\u20139), Creswell\n (1985),\n and Soames\n (2002,\n ch. 11) propose theories on which there are both\n\u201cunstructured\u201d and \u201cstructured\u201d properties and\npropositions, with the former conforming to intensionalism, and the\nlatter being in some sense \u201cconstructed\u201d\n(e.g.\u00a0set-theoretically) out of the former. The notion of\n\u201cconstruction\u201d, or its transitive closure, can provide an\nnon-trivial interpretation of partial definability in these theories.\nBut a hallmark of this kind of theory is that every structured\nproperty is necessarily coextensive with an unstructured one. Given\nthis, generalisation 6 would imply that every property is necessarily\ncoextensive with a perfectly natural property, a claim that is in\nobvious tension with the proposals we have considered linking\nnaturalness to similarity, duplication, qualitativeness, modality,\nlawhood, and mental and linguistic content.\n\nThe concept of full definability also has some notable\npossible applications in the theory of naturalness. We could appeal to\nit to provide an alternative articulation of the intuitive thought\nabout the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of the perfectly natural\nproperties, which Lewis captured using\n TSB:\n\nDefinability\n\nEvery property is fully definable out of some perfectly natural\nproperties and some\n objects.[64]\n\n\nSetting aside doubts about the intelligibility of\n Definability,\n it would seem to be at least as strong as\n TSB.[65]\n At least in the paradigm cases where a proposition is fully definable\nout of some properties and objects, the complete truth about which\nobjects there are and which ones instantiate each of those properties\nwill either necessitate that proposition or necessitate its negation.\nBy contrast, the inference from\n TSB\n to\n Definability\n is quite controversial. There are arguments which purport to show\nthat whenever a property supervenes on some properties, it is\ndefinable in terms of them (Jackson\n 1998;\n Stalnaker\n 1996);\n but these arguments rely on an intensionalist theory of properties,\nand raise difficult issues even in that setting (Leuenberger\n 2018).\n \n\nAssuming that\n TSB\n is weaker than\n Definability,\n it is arguably too weak to capture the intuitive idea that a\ndescription of the world in terms of perfectly natural properties\nshould be a \u201ccomplete\u201d description. Indeed, the claim that\nproperties that not perfectly natural are definable in terms of\nperfectly natural properties seems to be required for the\nsimplicity-of-definition criterion to yield sensible results.\nMoreover, many of those who see a gulf between definability and mere\nsupervenience have also felt that there is something metaphysically\nsuspect about infinite descending chains of definability. If we can\nfind a way to spell out a ban on such chains, it will plausibly imply\nthat every property is fully definable out of indefinable\nproperties (and objects); and this claim will in turn\n Definability\n if we take indefinability to imply perfect naturalness, as in (3) or\n(6) above. \n\nOn the other hand,\n Definability\n also faces objections that\n TSB\n avoids. For example, many philosophers follow Moore\n (1903)\n in denying that moral properties are definable from physical\nproperties while still affirming that they supervene on physical\nproperties; some such philosophers might be reluctant to say that any\nmoral properties are perfectly natural, perhaps because they are\nattracted to modal independence principles. \n4.11 Grounding\n\nMost of the present section has focused on generalisations linking naturalness with relatively familiar, easy-to-grasp notions.  We have not yet discussed possible links between naturalness and many other \u201cheavy duty\u201d metaphysical notions \u2014 notions whose good standing and theoretical utility is as controversial as that of naturalness itself.  Among the notions for which such connections might be worth investigating are: essence (Fine 1994); ontological dependence (see the entry on ontological dependence); truthmaking (see the entry on truthmakers); substance (see the entry on substance); reality and factuality (Fine 2001); modes of being (explained in terms of naturalness in McDaniel 2017b, ch.\u00a01); and degrees of being (McDaniel 2017b, ch.\u00a07).  Space precludes a discussion of these topics.  But to convey a sense of the possibilities, let us briefly consider some possible connections to grounding, a notion that has been especially prominent in the recent metaphysics literature (for background, see the\nentry on metaphysical grounding).\n\n\nEspecially given the widespread use of \u2018fundamental\u2019 as\nequivalent to \u2018ungrounded\u2019, it seems plausible that there\nmight be some intimate link between naturalness and\ngrounding. So far, however, most discussions of naturalness and\ngrounding tend to treat the notions as being in some sense rivals\n(see, e.g., Sider\n 2011,\n ch. 8), so there have been few attempts at systematic theorising\nusing both together. Here are some generalizations that seem worth\nconsidering:\n\nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by the\nfact that \\(G(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\), then \\(F\\) is less natural than\n\\(G\\). \nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by the\nfact that \\(G(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\), then \\(F\\) is not more natural than\n\\(G\\). \nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by some\nfact, then \\(F\\) is not perfectly natural. \nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by the\nfact that \\(G(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\), and \\(F\\) is perfectly natural, then\n\\(G\\) is perfectly natural.\nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is not partly grounded by\nany fact, then \\(F\\) is perfectly natural. \n\n\nNote that (1) implies (2) and (3), which each imply (4); (5) is independent of (1\u20134). The notion of\npartial ground might in turn be defined in terms of full\nground, which relates a plurality of facts (e.g. the fact that snow is\nwhite and the fact that grass is green) to a single fact (e.g. the\nfact that snow is white and grass is green): one fact partially\ngrounds another just in case it belongs to some plurality of facts\nthat fully grounds\n it.[66]\n\n\nThese suggestions are all quite tendentious. (1) is especially\nproblematic since it rules out cases where the fact that\n\\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is grounded by the fact that\n\\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\): for example, one might want to say that the\nfact that Central Park is in New York City is partially grounded by\nthe fact that Central Park is in Manhattan. While (2) avoids this\nproblem, it is still hard to square with a thesis endorsed by most grounding\ntheorists: that an existential generalization is partially grounded by\neach of its instances (Fine\n 2012,\n 59; Rosen\n 2010,\n 117). Consider a blob of clay \\(x\\) with a certain very specific\nshape-property \\(S\\). The thesis about existential generalizations\nentails that the fact that \\(x\\) has some shape or other is\npartially grounded by the fact that \\(x\\) has \\(S\\). But the idea that\n\\(S\\) is more natural than having some shape or other fits\npoorly with many other parts of the naturalness role, such as the\nconnections to similarity, content, laws, and ampliative reasoning. A\nworry about (3) is that it might make it too hard for a property to\ncount as perfectly natural. One might think that whenever the fact\nthat \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is ungrounded, there are also some other\nobjects \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) such that the fact that\n\\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) is grounded: perhaps, for example, the\nungrounded facts are all predications of mereologically simple objects\nof properties which are also instantiated by certain mereologically\ncomplex objects. Several of the generalizations also run into trouble\nif we assume a moderately coarse-grained conception of facts, on which\n(for example) the fact that Cleopatra loves Cleopatra is identical to\nthe fact that Cleopatra is a self-lover. For example, under this\nassumption, (5) will have the surprising consequence that if the fact\nthat \\(R(x,x)\\) is ungrounded, not only the binary relation \\(R\\), but\nalso the monadic property bearing \\(R\\) to oneself is\nperfectly\n natural.[67]\n (Grounding-theorists often assume a fine-grained account of facts\nwhich would avoid this kind of problem; but there are worries about\nthe consistency of such accounts similar to the worries about\nfine-grained theories of properties discussed in\n \u00a74.10.)\n \n\nMore ambitiously, one might attempt to provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for perfect naturalness in grounding-theoretic\nterms, by strengthening (5) to (6), or (3) to (7):\n\n\\(F\\) is perfectly natural if and only if it is possible for there\nto be some \\(x_1,\\ldots, x_n\\) such that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and the\nfact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is ungrounded. \n\\(F\\) is perfectly natural if and only if it is possible for there\nto be some \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) such that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\), and it\nis necessary that for any \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) such that\n\\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\), the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is\nungrounded. \n\n\n(6) and (7) are compatible, but their conjunction has a controversial\npurely grounding-theoretic consequence, namely that whenever\n\\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and the fact that \\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) is\nungrounded, the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is also ungrounded.\n\n\nOne could also consider trying to define grounding in terms of\nnaturalness. Here is a simple proposal, using the notion of\nnaturalness for propositions (see \u00a73.3),\nand assuming that facts are equated with true propositions:\n\n\\(p\\) is fully grounded by \\(qq\\) if and only if (a)\neach of \\(qq\\) is true; (b) it is necessary that if all of \\(qq\\)\nare true then \\(p\\) is true, and (c) each of \\(qq\\) is more natural \nthan \\(p\\).[68]\n\n\n\nGrounding theorists (who have generally been pessimistic about\nattempts to define grounding in other terms) will likely object that\n(8) wrongly entails that whenever \\(p\\) is fully grounded by \\(qq\\),\nand \\(r\\) is both true and more natural than \\(p\\) obtains, \\(p\\) is also fully grounded by \\(qq\\)\ntogether with \\(r\\) (even if \\(r\\) is intuitively completely\nirrelevant to \\(p\\)). One might try to refine (8) to avoid this\nobjection by adding some further \u201crelevance\u201d condition,\nalso explained in terms of naturalness; but it is not obvious how this\nshould go. \n\nOne further possible application of the ideology of grounding worth\nconsidering is in making precise the idea about the\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d of the description of the world in terms of\nperfectly natural properties which Lewis cashed out as\n TSB.\n An obvious idea is simply to replace the notion of metaphysical\nnecessitation in\n TSB\n with that of grounding: \n\nGrounding Completeness\n\nNecessarily, every fact is either fully grounded by, or a member of,\nsome collection of facts each of which is either (a) the fact that\n\\(R(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) or \\(\\neg R(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\), for some\nperfectly natural \\(R\\) and objects \\(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\); (b) the fact\nthat \\(\\exists y(y=x)\\), for some object \\(x\\), or (c) the fact that\nevery object is one of \\(xx\\), where \\(xx\\) are all the objects there\nare. \n\nGiven the standard assumption that full grounding entails\nnecessitation, this will be at least as strong as\n TSB,\n while arguably not being as strong as\n Definability\n (see\n \u00a74.10).\n5. Doubts about naturalness\n\nThe question whether to admit distinctions of naturalness among\nproperties is often treated as a major choice point for theorising in\nmetaphysics. Lewis presents his various proposals involving\nnaturalness as part of an overarching argument for the good standing\nof the notion of naturalness, based on its theoretical utility.\nMeanwhile, the rejection of distinctions of naturalness is often (e.g.\nby Taylor\n 1993)\n thought of as bound up with the denial of \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nor \u201cfull-blooded\u201d realism, and associated with\ncontroversial claims about mind-dependence or\nperspective-relativity.\n\nBut it is not obvious what is at issue in such disagreements. If\n\u201crejecting\u201d naturalness means holding that\n\u2018natural\u2019 is literally unintelligible (on the\nrelevant use), it seems misguided. So long as we take understanding a\nword to be a matter of induction into a practice rather than some\ndubious \u201cmagical grasp\u201d (Sider\n 2011,\n \u00a72.1), it is hard to imagine some plausibly attainable standard\nfor intelligibility that the practice of using \u2018natural\u2019\nin the relevant way fails to meet. A more promising idea is simply to\nequate \u201crejection\u201d of naturalness with the claim that no\nproperty is more natural than any other. (Similarly, atheists will do\nbetter claiming that nothing is more holy than anything else than\nclaiming that the word \u2018holy\u2019 is unintelligible.)\nUnfortunately, if we try to structure a debate around the question\n\u2018Are some properties more natural than others?\u2019, we will\nrun a serious risk of equivocation. One participant may treat it as\ndefinitional that if there are any distinctions of naturalness,\nnaturalness plays a certain wide array of the roles that Lewis and\nothers have claimed for it in the theories of similarity, lawhood,\nreference, epistemic value, etc.; such a philosopher will treat any\nargument that no single ranking of properties plays all of these roles\nas an argument that no property is more natural than any other.\nAnother participant might give pride of place to (say) the connection\nbetween naturalness and similarity, treating as obvious that some\nproperties are more natural than others (since some things are more\nsimilar to one another than others), while treating it as an open\nquestion whether naturalness has any interesting connection to\nlawhood, reference, etc. Such philosophers need not disagree over\nanything important.\n\nDorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n argue that \u2018Are some properties more natural than\nothers?\u2019 is too sensitive to unimportant disagreements about how\nphilosophical terms of art get their meanings to be a useful\n question.[69]\n Inspired by Lewis\u2019s work on theoretical terms (Lewis\n 1970b),\n they suggest that the central debates in this vicinity should focus,\ninstead, on the question which collections of the roles that\nnaturalness has been held to play in the literature are such that\nthere is some ranking of properties that plays all the roles\nin the collection. \u201cNaturalness enthusiasts\u201d will hold\nthat there is a single ranking of properties playing all or most of\nthe roles; \u201cnaturalness sceptics\u201d, meanwhile, will hold\nthat different roles impose incompatible constraints, so that no\nranking satisfies more than a few of them. (For example, one might\nthink that there is no family of properties on which all others\nsupervene and which are also such that properties with short, simple\ndefinitions terms of this family tend to be easier to refer to than\nproperties with only long, complex definitions.) Dorr and Hawthorne\ngive a long list of collections of roles whose co-satisfiability is\nnon-obvious. They also discuss one separate axis of disagreement: some\nwill think that \u2018natural\u2019, or at least \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019, is precise, or can readily be made so, while\nothers will regard it as vague, perhaps to a high\n degree.[70]\n\n\nOn this picture, the impression of a single choice point between\n\u201cadmitting\u201d and \u201crejecting\u201d naturalness is\nmisleading: the true theoretical landscape is quite intricate.\nMoreover, even the most \u201csceptical\u201d positions do not seem\nto have much of an anti-realist flavour. There is no obvious\nway to argue from the claim that there are extensive failures of\nco-satisfiability between the various alleged roles for naturalness,\nor from the claim that \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019 are highly vague, to some controversial claim of\nmind-dependence or relativity. Theories about naturalness provide ways\nof sharpening and fleshing out what Lewis\n (1984, 228)\n calls \u201cthe traditional realism that recognises objective\nsameness and difference, joints in the world, discriminatory\nclassifications not of our own making\u201d. But the ideas discussed\nin this article do not seem particularly helpful for making any\nnontrivial sense of the competing vision, on which questions of\nsimilarity and classification are in some systematic way\n\u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cup to us\u201d.",
