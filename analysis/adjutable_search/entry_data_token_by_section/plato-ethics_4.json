    "main_text": "The middle dialogues: Justice and other virtues || Virtues of state and soul\n3.2 Virtues of state and soul\n\r\nThe division of functions that leads to the separation of the three\r\nclasses for the purpose of achieving the social conditions for justice\r\nconcludes the discussion of the social order (427d\u2013434c). The\r\npeculiar manner in which Socrates further develops his explanation of\r\nthe nature of justice can best be understood with reference to the\r\nupshot of this discussion. The catalogue of what in later tradition\r\nhas been dubbed \u2018the four cardinal Platonic virtues\u2019\r\n\u2013 wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice \u2013 is first\r\npresented without comment. Piety, as the text indicates, is\r\nn\u03bft treated as a virtue; religious practices should, rather,\r\nbe left to tradition and to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi on the\r\nground that: \u201cWe have no knowledge of these things\u201d\r\n(427b\u2013c). The definition of justice is to be discovered\r\nby a process of elimination. If there are four virtues in the city,\r\nthen justice must be the one that is left over after the other three\r\nhave been identified. There is no proof offered that there are\r\nexactly four virtues in a state, nor that they are items that can be\r\nlifted up, singly, for inspection, like objects from a basket.\r\nInstead, Socrates points out the role they play in the maintenance of\r\nthe social order. About wisdom (sophia) \u2013 the only purely\r\nintellectual virtue and the exclusive possession of the rulers \u2013 little\r\nmore is said at this point than that it is \u2018good council\u2019\r\n(euboulia) in decisions about the internal and external\r\naffairs of the city. Courage (andreia) is the soldiers\u2019\r\nspecific virtue. Socrates takes some trouble explaining its nature\r\nbecause it is a mixture of belief (doxa) and steadfastness of\r\ncharacter (s\u00f4t\u00earia). It is compared to colorfast\r\nwool: Through thick and thin, the guardians must be dyed-in-the-wool\r\nadherents to the laws\u2019 decrees about what is to be feared and\r\nwhat is to be faced with confidence. Moderation\r\n(s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea) is not an intellectual excellence\r\neither, but rather a combination of belief with a certain disposition\r\nto support order. It is a conviction (doxa, 431e) shared by\r\nall classes about who should rule \u2013 a conviction based on a\r\nstate of \u2018order\u2019 (kosmos),\r\n\u2018consonance\u2019 (sumph\u00f4nia), and\r\n\u2018harmony\u2019 (harmonia). The state\u2019s third\r\nclass, then, has no specific virtue of its own. Finally, the\r\nidentification of justice is due to the sudden insight on\r\nSocrates\u2019 part that justice is the principle that has been at\r\nwork all along in the founding of the model state \u2013 namely, that\r\neveryone is to \u201cdo their own thing and not meddle with that of\r\nanother\u201d (433a).\n\r\nThe promise to establish the isomorphic structure of the city and soul\r\nhas not been forgotten. After the definition and assignment of the\r\nfour virtues to the three classes of the city, the investigation turns\r\nto the role and function of the soul\u2019s virtues. The soul is held\r\nto consist of three parts corresponding to the three classes in the\r\ncity. The lengthy argument for the tri-partition of the soul into a\r\nrational (logistikon), a spirited (thumoeides), and\r\nan appetitive (epithum\u00eatikon) part (434d\u2013441c)\r\ncan here be neither reproduced nor subjected to a critical evaluation.\r\nThat Plato lets Socrates express reservations concerning the adequacy\r\nof his own procedure, despite his unusually circumspect way of\r\njustifying the division of the soul\u2019s faculties, indicates that\r\nhe regards it as an important innovation. Indeed, there is no\r\nindication of separate parts of the soul in any of the earlier\r\ndialogues; irrational desires have been attributed there to the\r\ninfluence of the body. In the Republic, by contrast, the soul\r\nitself becomes the source of the appetites and desires. The difference\r\nbetween the rational and the appetitive part is easily justified\r\nbecause the opposition between the decrees of reason and the various\r\nkinds of unreasonable desires is familiar to everyone. The existence\r\nof a third, a \u2018spirited\u2019 or courageous part \u2013\r\ndifferent from both reason and appetite \u2013 is harder to prove.\r\nBut the phenomenon of moral indignation is treated as evidence for a\r\npsychic force that is reducible neither to reason nor to any of the\r\nappetites; it is rather an ally of reason in a well-ordered soul, a\r\nforce opposed to the unruly appetites. This concludes the proof that\r\nthere are three parts in the soul, corresponding to the three classes\r\nin the city \u2013 namely, the rational part representing the wisdom\r\nof the rulers, the spirited part, manifest in the courage of the\r\nsoldiers, and the appetitive part that motivates the rest of the\r\npopulation in its quest for material gain.\n\r\nThe discussion of the division of the soul sets the stage for the\r\nfinal determination of the contrast between justice and injustice\r\n(441c-445e): There will be justice in the city if the members of all\r\nthree classes mind their own business; similarly, in the individual\r\nsoul, there will be justice if each part of the soul fulfills its\r\nown function properly. This presupposes that the soul\u2019s two\r\nupper parts have been given the right kind of training and education\r\nin order to control the appetitive part. The three other virtues are\r\nthen assigned to the respective parts of the soul. Courage is the\r\nexcellence of the spirited part, wisdom belongs to the rational part,\r\nand moderation is the consent of all three parts about who should rule\r\nand who should obey. Justice turns out to be the overall unifying\r\nquality of the soul, for the just person not only refrains from\r\nmeddling with what is not his externally but also harmonizes the\r\nthree parts of the soul internally. While justice is order and\r\nharmony, injustice is its opposite: It is a rebellion of one part of\r\nthe city or soul against the others, and it results in the\r\ninappropriate rule of their inferior parts. Justice and injustice in\r\nthe soul are, then, analogous to health and illness in the body. This\r\ncomparison suffices to bring the investigation to its desired result:\r\nIf justice is health and harmony of the soul, then injustice must be\r\ndisease and disorder. Hence, it is clear that justice is a good state\r\nof the soul that makes its possessor happy, and injustice is its\r\nopposite. As no one in his right mind would prefer to live with a\r\nruined body, similarly no one would prefer to live with a diseased soul. In\r\nprinciple, the discussion of justice has, therefore, reached its\r\npromised goal already at the end of Book IV. Socrates has met\r\nGlaucon\u2019s and Adeimantus\u2019 challenge to prove that justice\r\nis a good, in and by itself, for the soul of its possessor, and\r\nthat it is preferable to injustice.\n\r\nThat the Republic\u2019s discussion does not end here but\r\noccupies six more books is due most of all to several loose ends that\r\nneed to be tied up. Apart from the fact that reason and order are to\r\nreign supreme, little has been said about the citizens\u2019 way of\r\nlife. This gap will be filled, at least in part, by the description of\r\nthe communal life of the upper classes without private property and\r\nfamily in Book V. More importantly, nothing has been said about the\r\nrulers and their particular kind of knowledge. This is a crucial point\r\nbecause, as the definitions of the three \u2018inferior\u2019\r\nvirtues show, their quality is contingent on the rulers\u2019 wisdom.\r\nSocrates addresses this problem with the provocative thesis\r\n(473c\u2013d): \u201cUntil philosophers rule as kings or those who\r\nare now called kings and leaders genuinely and adequately philosophize\r\n... cities will have no rest from evils, nor will the human\r\nrace.\u201d This thesis starts the discussion of the\r\nphilosophers\u2019 knowledge and of their upbringing and education,\r\nwhich will continue through Books VI and VII. Because they also\r\nintroduce the special objects of the philosophers\u2019 knowledge,\r\nthese books provide the metaphysical underpinning of the entire\r\nconception of the good soul and the good state, for the \u2018Form of\r\nthe Good\u2019 turns out to be the ultimate source of all being and\r\nknowledge. A short summary of the upshot of the educational program\r\nmust suffice here. The future philosophers, both women and men, are\r\nselected from the group of guardians whose general cultural training\r\nthey share. If they combine moral firmness with quickness of mind,\r\nthey are subject to a rigorous curriculum of higher learning that will\r\nprepare them for the ascent from the world of the senses to the world\r\nof intelligence and truth, an ascent whose stages are summed up in the\r\nsimiles of the Sun, the Line, and the Cave (508a\u2013518b). To\r\nachieve this ascent, the students have to undergo, first, a\r\npreparatory schooling of ten years\u2019 duration in the\r\n\u2018liberal arts\u2019: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and\r\ntheoretical harmonics (518c\u2013531c). Afterwards, they are admitted\r\nto the training in the master-science of \u2018dialectic\u2019, a\r\nscience that supposedly enables its possessor to deal in a systematic\r\nway with the objects of real knowledge \u2013 the Forms in general\r\n\u2013 and with the Form of the Good in particular \u2013 the\r\nprinciple of the goodness of all else (531c\u2013535a). This study is\r\nto last for another five years. Successful candidates are then sent\r\nback into the Cave as administrators of ordinary political life for 15\r\nyears. At the age of fifty, the rulers are granted leave to pursue\r\nphilosophy, but even that pursuit is interrupted by periods of service\r\nas overseers over the order of the state. This completes, in a\r\nnutshell, the description of the philosopher-kings\u2019 and\r\n-queens\u2019 education and activities (539d\u2013541b).\n\r\nPlato\u2019s design of an autocratic rule by an aristocracy of the\r\nmind has received a lot of flak. But our assessment of his politics\r\nmust here be limited to an assessment of the kind of happiness it supposedly\r\nprovides. Regardless of whether or not we find plausible Plato\u2019s\r\nassumption of an overall principle of the good as the basis of the\r\npolitical order, his model state has, at least in theory, the\r\nadvantage that it guarantees both internal and external peace. That is\r\nno mean feat in a society where interstate and civil wars were a\r\nconstant threat and often enough ended in the destruction of the\r\nentire city. In addition, the division of functions guarantees a high\r\ndegree of efficiency if every citizen does what he/she is naturally\r\nsuited to do. But what about the citizens\u2019 needs beyond those\r\nfor security and material goods? Are they to find their life\u2019s\r\nfulfillment only in the pursuit of their jobs? Plato seems to think\r\nso when he characterizes each class by its specific kind of desire\r\nand its respective good (581c): The philosophers are lovers of wisdom\r\n(philosophoi), the soldiers lovers of honor\r\n(philotimoi), and the workers are lovers of material goods\r\n(philochr\u00eamatoi). That human beings find, or at least\r\ntry to find, satisfaction in the kinds of goods they cherish is a\r\npoint that is further pursued in the depiction of the decay of the\r\ncity and its ruling citizens, from the best (the aristocracy of\r\nthe mind) down to the worst (the tyranny of lust) in\r\nBooks VIII and IX. A discussion of the tenability of this explanation\r\nof political and psychological decadence will not be attempted here.\r\nIt is supposed to show that all inferior forms of government of city\r\nand soul are doomed to fail because of the inherent tensions between\r\nthe goods that the different citizens aim for.\n\r\nSome brief comments on Plato\u2019s conception of happiness are in\r\norder at this point. He clearly goes on the assumption that human\r\nbeings are happy insofar as they achieve the goals they cherish.\r\nThough this notion seems to come close to the \u2018preference\r\nsatisfaction\u2019 for all citizens that is nowadays regarded as the\r\nprimary aim of every liberal state, Plato\u2019s restriction of each\r\nclass to one type of good must seem objectionable, most\r\nobviously in the case of the citizens of the third class who\r\nsupposedly covet nothing but material goods. This\r\n\u2018reductive\u2019 view of their human nature militates not only\r\nagainst present-day intuitions \u2013 it should also militate against\r\nPlato\u2019s own moral psychology, in that all human souls consist of\r\nthree parts \u2013 a rational, a spirited, and an appetitive part\r\n\u2013 whose health and harmony constitute the soul\u2019s and the\r\nstate\u2019s happiness. Why, then, reduce the third class to\r\nanimal-like creatures with low appetites, as suggested by the\r\ncomparison of the people to a strong beast that must be placated\r\n(493a\u2013c)? This comparison is echoed later in the comparison of\r\nthe soul to a multiform beast, where reason just barely controls the\r\nhydra-like heads of the appetites and manages to do so only thanks to\r\nthe aid of a lion-like spirit (588c\u2013590d). Is Plato thereby\r\ngiving vent to anti-democratic sentiments, showing contempt for the\r\nrabble, as has often been claimed? He can at least be cleared of the\r\nsuspicion that the workers are mere serfs of the upper classes\r\nbecause he explicitly grants them the free enjoyment of all the\r\ncustomary goods that he denies to the upper classes (419a):\r\n\u201cOthers own land, build fine big houses, acquire furnishings to\r\ngo along with them, make their own private sacrifices to the gods,\r\nentertain guests, and also, of course, possess what you were talking\r\nabout just now, gold and silver and all the things that are thought to\r\nbelong to people who are blessedly happy.\u201d\r\n\u2018Appetite\u2019 is clearly not confined to food, drink, and\r\nsex. But apart from the granting of material largesse, the members of\r\nthe third class are quite neglected in Plato\u2019s ideal city.\r\nApparently, no education is provided for them, for there is no\r\nsuggestion that they participate in the guardians\u2019 musical and\r\nathletic training, and there is no mention that obedience to the\r\nrulers\u2019 commands is not the only source of happiness for the\r\nthird class. Plato seems to sidestep his own insight that all human\r\nbeings have an immortal soul and have to take care of it as best they\r\ncan, as he not only demands in the Phaedo but is going to\r\nconfirm in a fanciful way in the Myth of Er at the end of\r\nRepublic Book X.\n\r\nThe lifestyle designated for the upper classes also seems open to\r\nobjections. The soldiers\u2019 musical and physical training is\r\nstrictly regimented; they must take satisfaction in obedience to\r\nthe laws for the sake of preserving the city\u2019s inner and outer\r\npeace, and in the deeds of valor in war. Theirs is an austere\r\ncamp-life; not all of them will be selected for higher education. But\r\neven the philosophers\u2019 lives leave a lot to be desired, and not\r\nonly because they have to starve their common human appetites and\r\ndevote many years to administrative duties back in the\r\n\u2018Cave\u2019. Their intellectual pursuits are also not\r\naltogether enviable, as a closer inspection would show. Not only do\r\nthe philosophers have two jobs \u2013 in violation of the rule\r\n\u2018one person \u2013 one function\u2019 \u2013 in that they are\r\nresponsible for both administrative work and philosophical thought.\r\nThey are also not to enjoy open-ended research but are, rather, subject\r\nto a mental training that is explicitly designed to turn their minds\r\naway from the enjoyment of all worldly beauty in order to focus\r\nexclusively on the contemplation of the Forms. This is indicated by\r\nthe injunctions concerning the study of astronomy and harmonics\r\n(529a\u2013531d): The students are not to crane their necks to watch\r\nthe beauty of the \u201cembroidery in the heavens\u201d but rather\r\nto concern themselves with the ideal motions of ideal moving bodies\r\nin a purely geometrical fashion, and they are not to listen to audible\r\nsounds, but to attend to the mathematics of harmonics. The universe is\r\nnot treated as an admirable cosmos \u2013 with the explicit purpose of\r\nproviding moral and intellectual support to the citizens \u2013 in the way\r\nPlato is going to explain in the Philebus, the\r\nTimaeus, and in the Laws. Given these limitations of\r\nthe philosophers\u2019 mental exercises in the Republic, the\r\nclaim that their lives are 729 times more pleasant than the\r\ntyrants\u2019 (IX 587e) seems like a gross exaggeration, even if they\r\nenjoy the pleasures of being filled with pure and unadulterated truths\r\nwhile everyone else enjoys only semblances of the really real\r\n(581e\u2013588a).\n\r\nFor all the advances that the Republic represents in certain\r\nrespects, Plato\u2019s ideal city must seem to us far from ideal. The\r\nsystem resembles a well-oiled machine where everyone has their\r\neconomic niche and function, but its machine-like character must seem\r\nrepellent to us, given that no deviations are permitted from the\r\nprescribed pattern. If innovations are forbidden, no room is left for\r\ncreativity and personal development. Plato seems to presuppose that\r\nthe fulfillment of a person\u2019s function is sufficient to secure\r\nher happiness, or at least that is suggested by the\r\n\u2018functional\u2019 argument that defeats Thrasymachus\r\n(352d\u2013354a). It states that every object, animal, and person has\r\na specific function or work (ergon). If it performs its\r\nfunction well, it does well: For a living thing, \u2018doing\r\nwell\u2019 means \u2018living well\u2019 and living well is\r\ntantamount to \u2018living happily\u2019. Though Socrates\u2019\r\nrefutation of Thrasymachus is found wanting as a proof of\r\njustice\u2019s superiority, the ergon-argument is nowhere\r\nrevoked. On the contrary, it is affirmed by the principle of\r\n\u2018one person \u2013 one job\u2019 that is the very basis of\r\nPlato\u2019s ideal city. But the confinement of everyone\u2019s\r\nactivities to just one kind of work seems rather a narrow one\r\nin the case of the citizens of the third class, given that they are\r\nnot permitted to engage in politics, even if it may be economically\r\nmost efficient. These features suffice to make the ideal life in\r\nPlato\u2019s city unattractive to us, not to speak of certain other\r\nfeatures that have not been explored here, such as the communal life\r\nenvisaged for the upper classes and the assignment of sexual\r\npartnerships by a lottery that is rigged for the purposes of eugenics.\r\nBut the feature that must strike us as strangest about Plato\u2019s\r\ndepiction of his citizens\u2019 lives is that he does not acknowledge\r\nthe one factor that could throw a more favorable light on the\r\nlife of the third class, the life of tailors, carpenters, doctors,\r\narchitects, sailors, i.e., that they will take pride and joy in their\r\nown work and in what they produce, given that they each in their own\r\nway make valuable contributions to the community\u2019s well-being,\r\nwithout which the city could not function. Plato does not seem to\r\nacknowledge this when he addresses them, rather ungraciously, as\r\n\u2018money-lovers\u2019, indicating that he regards material gain\r\nas the only motivating factor in their lives.\n\r\nHave these deficiencies escaped Plato\u2019s notice? Justified as\r\nthis critique must seem, it should be pointed out that Plato is\r\nclearly not concerned with the conditions that would make his city\r\nattractive to all citizens. His aim is rather more limited: He wants\r\nto present a model and work out its essential features.\r\nThe same explanation applies to his depiction of the city\u2019s and\r\nits citizens\u2019 decay in Books VIII and IX. Contrary to certain\r\ncritics\u2019 assumptions, Plato is not there trying to predict and\r\nexplain the course of history. Rather, he wants to explain the\r\ngeneration and decay typical of each political system and the\r\npsychopathology of its leaders. Plato finds the basis of both in the\r\nspecific values \u2013 be they honor, money, freedom, or lust \u2013\r\nthat are embedded in the constitutions of the different types of\r\nstate. It is unlikely that Plato presupposes that there are, in reality,\r\npure representatives of these types, though some historical states may\r\nhave been better representatives of those types than others. But the\r\nquestion remains whether he had a notion of the fact that his\r\nblack-and-white picture of civic life in the model-state disregards\r\nthe claim of individuals to have their own aims and ends and not to\r\nbe treated like automata, with no thoughts and wishes of their own.\r\nThough the Republic contains some suggestions that would\r\nmitigate this bleak picture, for the sake of balancing this picture, it\r\nis more fruitful to look at other works of Plato\u2019s middle period\r\nthat concentrate on and prioritize the conditions of the\r\nindividual soul rather than focus on the demands of the\r\ncommunity. These works are the Symposium and the\r\nPhaedrus, for though each dialogue should be studied as a\r\nunity of its own, it is also necessary to treat the different\r\ndialogues as part of a wider picture.\n",
