    "main_text": "Logic || The history of logic\n3.5 The history of logic\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz revolutionized the history of logic. He proposed to\nlook at the history of logical ideas through the glasses of\nmathematical logic. The reason was that he was convinced about the\ncontinuity of formal logic from Aristotle to modern mathematical\nlogic, perhaps with a break from the 16th century to Boole\nand Frege (of course, with the exception of Leibniz). Thus, old sound\nlogical theories should be considered as anticipations of ideas\nadvanced in the 19th and the 20th centuries.\nGuided by this assumption, \u0141ukasiewicz showed that the Stoics\ninvented propositional calculus, contrary to the prevailing view that\nStoic logic was a part of Aristotle\u2019s logic. In particular,\n\u0141ukasiewicz demonstrated that the Stoic logic of propositions was\na system of rules, not theorems. Another of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nhistorical discoveries consisted in the rehabilitation of medieval\nlogic, commonly neglected as fruitless scholasticism. He was joined in\nthese investigations by Boche\u0144ski and Salamucha.\n\nHistorical work inspired logicians of the LWS toward modern\ninterpretations of traditional logical doctrines. The most famous is\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s formalization of the Aristotelian logic of\ncategorical sentences (the syllogistic plus conversion and other rules\nof so-called direct inference). \u0141ukasiewicz interpreted this\nlogic as a specific formal theory, not as a fragment of predicate\nlogic, as it was usually done (for example by Frege or Russell). Yet\nthe logic of categorical sentences assumes propositional logic as\nprior. The logic of assertoric sentences (\u0141ukasiewicz also\nconsidered its modal extension) has the following form. Let the\nformulas (lower-case letters are term variables) Uab,\nIab, Yab, Oab stand for the sentences\n\u201cevery a is b\u201d, \u201csome a\nare b\u201d, \u201cno a is b\u201d and\n\u201csome a are not b\u201d. We can define\nYab as NIab and Oab as NUab. The\naxioms are as follows: (a) Uaa; (b) Iaa; (c)\nCKUmbUamUab (the Barbara modus); (d) CKUmbImaIab\n(the Datisi mode); the rules are: all the rules of propositional\ncalculus, substitution for term variables, the definitional\nreplacement according to the definitions of Yab and\nOab.\n",
