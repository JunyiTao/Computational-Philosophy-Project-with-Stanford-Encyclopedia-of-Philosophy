Background\n\nThe notion of replication arose as a concern in the period immediately\nafter the Second World War (see\n Figure 1),\n with the rise of information theory, communication theory,\ncybernetics, and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s 1944 book What is\nLife? Biologists immediately began to consider the\ninformational aspect of life, in each of these theoretical frameworks,\nin areas ranging from neurology to molecular biology, but especially\nthe latter (Brookes 1956; Eigen & de Maeyer 1966; Gatlin 1972;\nJohnson 1970; Linschitz 1953; Margalef 1957 [1958]; Quastler 1953;\nRashevsky 1955). It was only after the development of communications\ntheory by Shannon (1948) and cybernetics by Wiener (1948) after\nit that inheritance in biology took on a specifically\ninformational tint (Griffiths & Stotz 2007). This is the case in\nparticular of the work of Watson and Crick on the double helix\nstructure of DNA (Watson & Crick 1953), as well as Crick\u2019s\nCentral Dogma, which states that information cannot flow from protein\nto DNA. The Central Dogma (Crick 1958) was initially cast in terms of\nstructural information (\u0160ustar 2007;\n Figure 2) and\n later recast by Crick as a more cybernetic or computational kind of\ninformation (Crick 1970). [See Eugene V. Koonin 2012 & 2015 for\ndiscussion of the nature of the Central Dogma in current biology.]\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Yearly frequency of count for\nthe word \u201creplication\u201d in Google text\u2019s English\ncorpus from 1800\u20132000 with smoothing = 3. Data obtained from\nGoogle Ngram Viewer (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nStructural information is effectively based on the transfer of\nmolecular primary sequences (linear sequence) in the synthesis of\npolypeptides; that is, it is the literal sequence of basic groups\n(amino acids), before the protein folds into secondary and higher\nconformations. This is a physical and causal account of information:\nthe new molecule has its sequence because it was templated in some way\nby the \u201cinformation\u201d-imparting molecule (in this case, DNA\nto proteins). Griffiths and Stotz (see below) call this, accordingly,\n\u201cCrick information\u201d.\n\nHowever, in the late 1950s, after the structure of DNA had become more\nwidely understood, chemist Homer Jacobson proposed a\ncybernetic model of reproduction (Jacobson 1958), going so\nfar as to make a literal model out of train sets and electronic\ncircuits. Later, von Neumann proposed a theory of self-reproducing\nautomata (Neumann 1966), which has become a parallel but influential\nresearch program to the issue in biology (Mitchell 2009). Jacob (1973)\ncemented the logical description of heredity, but the ultimate\nclassical source of the notion that genes are information comes from\nWilliams\u2019 classic 1966 book Adaptation and Natural\nSelection, in which he referred to genes as \u201ccybernetic\nabstractions\u201d (1966: 33).\n\nThe cybernetic notion of reproduction (and, later, replication) rested\non the notion that genes were controllers of phenotypes;\nlater, this came to be identified (e.g., by Gatlin) as synonymous with\nthe \u201ccommunication\u201d conception of information that Shannon\nproposed. In biology, genes came to be seen as \u201cprograms\u201d\nfor phenotypes [senders] that passed themselves on to progeny\n[receivers], around 1961 (Peluffo 2015).\n\nWilliams\u2019 book was one inspiration for Dawkins\u2019\nSelfish Gene (1976), and much of what Dawkins proposed about\nreplicators is an extension of Williams\u2019 views, in conjunction\nwith those of William D. Hamilton (1964) and various ethological\nideas. This view is now known as the gene\u2019s eye view (for\ndiscussions see Okasha 2006, Chapter 5; \u00c5gren 2021).\n\nWilliams introduced the notion of a gene as a substrate neutral\nentity:\n\n\nI use the term \u2018gene\u2019 to mean that which separates and\nrecombines with appreciable frequency, (1966: 20)\n\n\nand he further defined an evolutionary gene (that is, one\nthat is selectively important):\n\n\n[A] gene could be defined as any hereditary information for which\nthere is a favorable or unfavorable selection bias equal to several or\nmany times its rate of endogenous change. (1966: 25)\n\n\nHis answer to the question of what a gene is, is that a gene is\nevolutionary just insofar as it is something heritable that is subject\nto rates of selection that exceed the mutation rate. This is a\ndefinition, not a discovery. If it is favorably or unfavorably\nselected and heritable, it is an evolutionary gene. According to this\ndefinition, items that are not made of DNA can be classed as\nevolutionary genes so long as they match Williams\u2019 definition\n(Lu & Bourrat 2018).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The Central Dogma of genetics\nas envisaged by Crick around 1965 (Thieffry & Sarkar 1998).\n\n2. Genes and Information\n\nThe language of \u201ccodes\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d\nflows easily enough with respect to replication [see the entry\n biological information].\n Transcription, translation, punctuation, redundancy, synonymy,\nediting, proofreading, errors, repairing of errors, messages, copies,\nand information all sound natural enough. Yet, the literature dealing\nwith information is both extensive and factious. Several different\nformal analyses of information can be found and very little agreement\nabout which analysis is best for which subjects. On one point, these\nscholars tend to agree\u2014cybernetic information and\ncommunication-theoretic information will not do for replication in\nbiological contexts. Some argue for semantic information\n(Godfrey-Smith 2000a; Sarkar 2000; Sterelny 2000b). The trouble is\nthat no widely accepted version of semantic information exists. Winnie\n(2000) distinguishes between Classical and Algorithmic Information\nTheory and opts for a revised version of the Algorithmic Theory. But,\nonce again, the problem is that no such formal analysis currently\nexists.\n\nIn the face of all this disagreement and unfinished business,\nbiologists such as Maynard Smith (2000) maintain either that informal\nanalyses of \u201cinformation\u201d are good enough or that some\nfuture formal version of information theory will justify the sorts of\ninferences that they make. The sense of \u201cinformation\u201d used\nin the Central Dogma of molecular biology is more like a fit of\ntemplate, or the primary structure of the protein sequence compared to\nthe sequence of the DNA base pairs. Attempts have been made in what is\nnow known as bioinformatics to use Classical Information Theory\n(Shannon\u2019s theory of communication) to extract functional and\nphylogenetic information (Brooks & Wiley 1988; Gatlin 1972;\nMaclaurin 1998; Rodrick Wallace & Wallace 1998), but they appear\nto have been unsuccessful in the main.\n\nWhile the most likely conclusion is that no version of information\ntheory as currently formulated can handle \u201cinformation\u201d as\nit functions in biology (Griffiths 2001), attempts have continued to\nbe made to formulate just such a version (Bergstrom & Rosvall\n2011; Sternberg 2008). However, this undercuts the motivation for\nappealing to information theory to elucidate genes in the first\ninstance. Griffiths & Stotz (2013: 153) have argued for\n\u201cCrick\u201d information, which they define as \u201cthe\nspecification of the order of amino acids in a polypeptide\nchain\u201d. This specificity definition is more chemical than\nabstract [see the section below on\n Developmental Systems Theory].\n\nThe \u201cinformational gene\u201d conception, as James R. Griesemer\n(2005) terms it, is a highly abstract concept of a process and the\nentities that comprise it. This is intentional, as it permits\nDarwinian dynamics to be applied to a range of phenomena, such as\nsociocultural, cybernetic, and medical processes. However, this raises\na metaphysical concern, namely that the view that a gene is nothing\nbut information is a version of Aristotelian hylomorphism [see the\nentry\n form versus matter].\n That is, information is a type of form, which can be used to explain\nphysical processes. Classical hylomorphism was roundly demolished as a\nscientific hypothesis when Daltonian elements were named and\ninvestigated in the nineteenth century. By 1900, terms like\n\u201csubstance\u201d (for matter that is propertyless apart from\nmass and extension in space) and \u201cform\u201d had taken on a\nlargely philosophical sense that differed extensively from\nAristotle\u2019s own physical views. Griesemer notes:\n\n\nWe know that the informational genes are tied to matter and structure,\nbut if evolutionary theory \u2013 to be general enough to cover\ncultural and conceptual change \u2013 must be devoid of all reference\nto concrete mechanism, it cannot follow from the theory, for example,\nthat genes are inside organisms or are even parts of organisms, as\nDawkins\u2019s language suggests. Strictly, only the correlations\nbetween replicator and vehicle due to causal connections of a\ncompletely unspecified sort can be implied by such a theory. Striving\nto get matter and specific structure out of the theory in order to\nmake it apply to immaterial realms may thus leave it bankrupt as an\naccount of causal connection for the material, biological cases.\n(2005: 79)\n\n\nAnd yet, this kind of hylomorphism has remained, even in science.\nBiologists have argued that form determined many properties of\norganisms in ways that could not be reduced to the actions of their\nparts, and this kind of thinking remained and was co-opted by the\nmolecular biologists and geneticists. Thus, we get the Central Dogma\nof molecular biology:\n\n\nThe Central Dogma\n\nThis states that once \u2018information\u2019 has passed into\nprotein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer\nof information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid\nto protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or\nfrom protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the\nprecise determination of sequence, either of bases in the\nnucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. (Crick\n1958)\n\n\nRead physically, this means only that the structure of the DNA\nmolecule is not reproduced from the structure of proteins, a perfectly\nreasonable account of the molecular processes. However, because Crick\nused the word \u201cinformation\u201d, some scientists, including\nDawkins, took this to mean that genes are informational entities,\nwhich \u201ccode\u201d for organismic traits from the molecular\nlevel up to the entire organism and even beyond. This is striking in a\npurple passage of The Blind Watchmaker, where Dawkins\ndescribes genes as follows:\n\n\nIt is raining DNA outside. [downy seeds from willow trees] \u2026\nThe cotton wool is mostly made of cellulose, and it dwarfs the tiny\ncapsule that contains the DNA, the genetic information. The DNA\ncontent must be a small proportion of the total, so why did I say that\nit was raining DNA rather than cellulose? The answer is that it is the\nDNA that matters\u2026 whose coded characters spell out specific\ninstructions for building willow trees\u2026 It is raining\ninstructions out there, it\u2019s raining programs; it\u2019s\nraining tree-growing, fluff spreading, algorithms. That is not a\nmetaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn\u2019t be any plainer if\nit were raining floppy disks. (1986: 111)\n\n\nSo, we now turn to Dawkins\u2019 view of genes as\nreplicators and the way in which he takes information to be\ncybernetic and physical at the same time.\n3. Dawkins\u2019 View\n\nRichard Dawkins introduced the distinction between replicators and\nvehicles in The Selfish Gene (1976). For his purposes,\nDawkins found the contrast between genes and organisms too restrictive\nand specific. Everyone agrees that genes are replicators, but genes\nmay not be the only replicators. Dawkins also argued that perhaps more\ninclusive entities than single genes might also function as\nreplicators. At the very least, the possibility should not be ignored.\nSo, Dawkins adopted \u201creplicator\u201d as a more inclusive and\ngeneral term than \u201cgene\u201d. In The Extended\nPhenotype, he defined a replicator as \u201canything in the\nuniverse of which copies are made\u201d (Dawkins 1982b: 83). He also\nintroduced the term \u201cvehicle\u201d for those entities produced\nby replicators that help these replicators increase in numbers by\ninteracting effectively with their environments. This distinction can\nbe expressed in terms of either entities or processes. According to\nDawkins, replicators function in replication, while vehicles function\nin environmental interaction.\n3.1 Genes as Replicators\n\nA longstanding dispute in evolutionary biology concerns the levels at\nwhich selection can occur (Bourrat 2015b, 2021; Brandon 1996;\nKerr & Godfrey-Smith 2002; Keller 1999; Lloyd 1988; Okasha 2006,\n2016; Sober & Wilson 1998; Williams 1966) [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n Some authors see this dispute as concerning the levels at which\nreplication can take place. Other authors take the levels of selection\ndispute to concern environmental interaction and insist that\nenvironmental interaction can take place at a variety of levels, from\nsingle genes, cells, and organisms to colonies, demes, and possibly\nentire species. Organisms certainly interact with their environments\nin ways that bias the transmission of their genes, but then so do\nentities that are both less inclusive than entire organisms (e.g.,\nsperm cells) and more inclusive (e.g., beehives).\n\nDawkins argued that replication in biological evolution\noccurs exclusively at the level of the genetic material. The term\n\u201creplication\u201d refers first and foremost to copying, and\ngenes are the self-replicating molecules of biology. Some critics\n(e.g., Lewontin 1991: 48) interpreted this to mean that a strand of\nDNA placed on a glass slide might start replicating all on its own. Of\ncourse, no biologist has ever held such a view. Genes do replicate\nthemselves, but only with the aid of highly complicated molecular\nmachinery. Too often, however, the importance of this machinery has\ngone unnoticed. To be sure, when we make copies on a photocopier, we\nare interested in the texts, figures, or just scrawls that appear on\nthese sheets of paper. We are not interested in how the photocopier\nworks, even if it does all the work.\n\nIn Dawkins\u2019 early writings, replicators and vehicles played\ndifferent but complementary and equally important roles in selection;\nhowever, as he honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles\nbecame less and less fundamental. Initially, Dawkins was content to\ndethrone the organism from its pride of place in biology. It is an\nimportant focus of environmental interaction, but other entities, both\nbelow and above the organismic level, can also function as vehicles.\nIn later writings, however, Dawkins went even further to argue that\nphenotypic traits are what really matter for evolution by natural\nselection to occur and that they can be treated independently of their\nbeing organized into vehicles. More than that, features such as spider\nwebs should be viewed as part of a spider\u2019s phenotype. Hence,\nDawkins titled his second book The Extended Phenotype\n(Dawkins 1982b).\n\nDawkins never lost his fascination with vehicular adaptations, a\nfascination that his critics denigrate as Panglossian adaptationism.\nHe filled his books with adaptationist scenarios, some more firmly\nsupported by data than others; however, from the perspective of\nthe structure of evolutionary theory, he held that replicators are\nmuch more important than vehicles. For example, Dawkins argued at some\nlength that adaptations are always for the good of replicators, not\nvehicles (Lloyd 1992) [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n Vehicles exhibit these adaptations, but ultimately all\nadaptations must be explicable in terms of changes in gene\nfrequencies. Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins (1994: 617)\nproclaims that he \u201ccoined the term \u2018vehicle\u2019 not to\npraise it but to bury it\u201d. As prevalent as organisms might be,\nas definite as the causal roles that they play in selection are,\nreference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous\ncharacterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Although\nDawkins is far from a genetic determinist, he is certainly a\ngenetic reductionist. Whether reductionism itself is good or\nbad is a moot question (Sarkar 1998).\n\nAccording to Dawkins, replicators have three basic\nproperties\u2014longevity, fecundity and\ncopy-fidelity. Longevity means longevity of the gene\ntype in the form of copies through descent (Dawkins 1982b:\n84; Hull 1980), although the stability of gene tokens is\nincluded in the definition in The Selfish Gene (1976: 18). No\ngene as a physical body lasts all that long. In mitosis, a gene loses\nhalf of its substance at each replication. What endures, he says, is\nnot the entity itself but the information incorporated in its\nstructure. It is this information that is copied with such high\nfidelity. Mutations do occur, but at very low frequencies. Even so, in\nsome organisms, mutation rates must be too high because mechanisms\nhave evolved that search out and repair such errors. Therefore, the\ngenotype is an informational notion; information is equivalent to\nAristotelian form. The type is the form of the tokens, in\nDawkins\u2019 view.\n\nOne source of variation in genes of sexual organisms supplementing\nmutation is crossover. Pairs of homologous chromosomes line up next to\neach other at meiosis, crossover, and recombine. For stretches of DNA\nin which different alleles exist, the result can be a change in\ninformation. Quite obviously, the shorter the stretch of DNA involved,\nthe less likely that crossover will occur and the message change.\nDawkins appeals to such dismantling of entities to argue against\norganisms functioning as replicators. In sexual organisms, organisms\nthemselves are torn apart and repeatedly assembled each generation\n(Caporael 2003). If long stretches of DNA lack the necessary identity\nby descent to function as replicators, then sexual organisms certainly\nlack it. However, some other explanation has to be provided for\nasexual organisms because they pass on their overall structure largely\nunchanged from generation to generation. For example, R. A. Fisher,\nin The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (Fisher\n1930) considered the entire genetic complement of asexual organisms to\nbe a single gene, and this view has been repeated from time to time\nsince. According to Dawkins, genes, and only genes, can function as\nreplicators in biological evolution. How large these genetic units are\ndepends on such things as the prevalence of sex, the frequency of\ncrossover or lateral gene transfers, and the intensity of\nselection.\n\n\nIf there were sex but no crossing-over, each chromosome would be a\nreplicator, and we should speak of adaptations as being for the good\nof the chromosome. If there is no sex we can, by the same token, treat\nthe entire genome of an asexual organism as a replicator. But the\norganism itself is not a replicator. (Dawkins 1982a: 95)\n\n\nDawkins offered two reasons for organisms not being able to function\nas replicators. The first is the one he uses to delineate evolutionary\ngenes. As is the case for long stretches of DNA, organisms are too\neasily and frequently broken up to be considered units of replication.\nA second reason is that they cannot pass on changes in their\nstructure, although some phenotypic change may result in generational\nchange. In fact, some epigenetic mechanisms have been shown\nto be passed on across generations (Jablonka & Raz 2009; see the\nentry on\n inheritance systems).\n The amount of DNA that counts as a replicator certainly varies; but,\naccording to Dawkins, nothing more inclusive than the genetic material\nfunctions as replicators in biological evolution.\n\nIn The Selfish Gene, although Dawkins wanted his definition\nof gene to be close to that of Williams\u2019 (1966)\n\u201cevolutionary gene\u201d, it is not quite:\n\n\nA gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material which\npotentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural\nselection. (Dawkins 1976: 30)\n\n\nWhere Williams\u2019 definition is substrate neutral, Dawkins\u2019\nis explicitly chromosomal and DNA-based. Where William\u2019s\n\u201cgene\u201d refers to any entity, which is the reason\nwhy it is an informational notion, Dawkins\u2019 gene, by contrast,\nis tied to DNA, a view later heavily criticized by Stent (1977),\nan influential molecular biologist at the time.\n\nOn Dawkins\u2019 account, the limits of genes need not be absolutely\nsharp. Nor must all genes be of the same length. The greater the\nselection pressure, the smaller the gene. At the most fundamental\nlevel, selection takes place between alternative alleles residing at\nthe same locus.\n\n\nAs far as a gene is concerned, its alleles are its deadly rivals, but\nother genes are just a part of its environment, comparable to\ntemperature, food, and predators, or companions. (Dawkins 1976:\n40)\n\n\nAlleles cannot cooperate with each other, only compete. That is\nwhere the \u201cselfish\u201d in \u201cselfish gene\u201d comes\nin. According to Dawkins (1976: 95), the selfish gene is not just one\nphysical bit of DNA. It is \u201call replicas of a particular bit of\nDNA, distributed throughout the world\u201d (for a recent defense of\na similar approach, see Haig 2012). Hence, genes do not form classes\nof spatiotemporally unrelated individuals but trees. They must be\nreplicas. But, being a replica is not enough. The linear repetition of\nthe \u201csame gene\u201d in the form of several hundred copies is\nquite common. These replicas, however, do not reside at the same\nlocus. Although identical in structure, these genes do not\ncompete with each other in the way that alleles at the same locus can.\nIn the simplest and most basic sense, alleles compete with alternative\nalleles at the same locus. Any other sorts of competition and\ncooperation are merely extrapolations from this fundamental sense of\nallelic competition. Although genes may cooperate with each other in\nvery complicated ways in embryological development, in replication\nthey can be treated as \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d. In\ndevelopment, the effects of genes blend. In replication, replicators\ndo not blend.\n3.2 Hull\u2019s Interactors\n\nDawkins introduced the general notions of replicator and vehicle so\nthat selection need not be limited exclusively to gene-based\nbiological evolution. However, as the preceding discussion indicates,\nhis later revisions to his general theoretical outlook were influenced\nstrongly by the traditional perspective of genes and organisms. Genes\ncontain the information necessary to produce organisms and their\nadaptations. Genes \u201cride around\u201d in and\n\u201cguide\u201d organisms. As Dawkins describes them, vehicles are\nrelatively discrete entities that \u201chouse\u201d replicators and\nthat can be regarded as machines programmed to preserve and propagate\nthe replicators that ride inside them. Although these terms may be\nappropriate for the relations between genes and organisms, they\ninterfere with a more general analysis of replication and selection.\nWhat really matters in selection is that entities at various levels of\norganization interact with their environments in such a way that the\nrelevant replicators increase in relative frequency. The actual causal\nchain that connects replicators and vehicles need not be limited to\ndevelopment.\n\nFor example, Dawkins argues at some length that genes and only genes\ncan function as replicators in biological evolution. He adds that\n\u201call adaptations are for the preservation of DNA; DNA itself\njust is\u201d (Dawkins 1982a: 45). But, DNA itself exhibits\nadaptations. Anyone who has spent much time examining the molecular\nstructure of DNA soon realizes that it is adapted to replicate. In\naddition, the proliferation of junk DNA, transposons, and meiotic\ndrive are three examples in which the only phenotypes that matter are\nphenotypic characteristics of genes (Brandon 1996; Sterelny 1996:\n388). Dawkins\u2019 characterizations of replicators, vehicles, and\nthe relations between the two are too closely tied to genes,\norganisms, and development. DNA can certainly replicate itself, but it\ncan also function as a \u201cvehicle\u201d, even though it cannot\ncode for, ride around in, or direct itself. In sum, a more general\ncharacterization of selection is needed, a characterization that does\nnot assume that the only causal connection between replicators and\nvehicles is development from embryo to maturity. Such a generalization\nwas offered by Hull (1980, 1981, 1988), who proposed that the relevant\nnotion is \u201cinteractor\u201d rather than \u201cvehicle\u201d,\nas interactors are causal and active while vehicles are passive\nentities.\n4. Other Examples of Replicators\n\nAlthough Dawkins finds it desirable to replace genes with replicators\nin his general characterization of the evolutionary process, he says\nvery little about this more general notion in The Selfish\nGene. Only one chapter (11) is dedicated to \u201cmemetic\u201d\nevolution. Instead, as we saw, he discusses the special case of genes\nas replicators. The primacy of the genetic perspective in the\ncharacterization of replicators is claimed by some (Griesemer 2000b)\nto be one of the chief weaknesses not only in Dawkins\u2019\ndiscussions but also in the work of his successors [see the section\nbelow on\n Reproducers].\n Hull and his colleagues (Hull, Langman, & Glenn 2001) claim to be\nproviding a general notion of replication, adequate to handle all\ndifferent sorts of replication, when too often we are simply reading\npeculiarities of genetic replication into our general analysis of\nreplication.\n4.1 The Immune System\n\nDoes replication play the same role in other sorts of selection that\nit plays in gene-based biological evolution? The reaction of the\nimmune system to antigens is closest to the standard biological\nexample of replication and selection (Hull et al. 2001). Certainly,\nimmune systems arose through the same process as other functional\nsystems. The basic structure of the human immune system is\n\u201cbuilt into our genes\u201d, and the only genes that count in\nevolution are the ones that we received from our ancestors and can\nsubsequently pass on to our progeny. In Dawkins\u2019 (1982b: 83)\nterminology, the genes that code for our immune system are active,\ngerm-line replicators. They are active because they influence their\nprobability to be copied; they are germ-line because they can\npotentially have an infinity of descendants.\n\nHowever, the genes that function in the reaction of the immune system\nto antigens have two peculiarities. First, they incorporate mechanisms\ndesigned to produce very high frequencies of mutation; second, none of\nthe genes involved in the functioning of the immune system are\ngerm-line. For instance, the genes that give rise to B-cells are\ndesigned to mutate extensively until one of these cells identifies an\ninvader as foreign. It then proliferates extensively as it attacks the\ninvader. As an organism matures, it accumulates more and more of the\nB-cells that have been successful in its past. More than this, as\nthe process of proliferation continues, the strength of the affinities\nto binding sites increases. Initially, the primary antibodies almost\nalways exhibit a weak affinity for their targets; however, as the\nreaction to the antigen continues, these affinities become\nstronger.\n\nWithin the confines of a single organism, the reaction of the immune\nsystem to antigens has all the characteristics of selection processes;\nhowever, when the organism dies, all of these adaptations are lost. In\nsome species, females pass on not only the genes for the basic\nstructure of their immune systems but also some of the machinery that\npast invasions of antigens have produced in them. However, these cells\nare rapidly removed from the offspring as it develops its own immune\nsystem. The reaction of the immune system to antigens departs from\ngene-based selection in biological evolution in two ways. First, from\nthe organismal perspective, the genes that function in protecting an\norganism from invaders are not germ-line. They are somatic. Second,\nthe relevant mutation rates are much, much higher in the immune system\nthan in ordinary gene-based selection. Instead of mechanisms existing\nto discover mutations and repair them, mechanisms exist that encourage\nmutations\u2014massively so. If the functioning of the immune system\nis to count as an adaptive process, some changes must be made.\nOne possibility is to clarify what counts as a \u201cgerm-line\u201d\nreplicator and reject the notion that extremely low mutation\nrates are inherent in all selection processes [see the section below\non\n Challenges to the Replicator].\n4.2 Sociocultural Evolution\n\nThe temptation to regard cultures and societies as evolving entities\nin a way analogous to organisms has a long tradition. In The\nSelfish Gene (Chapter 11), Dawkins proposes a version of it that\nmakes use of the concept of the replicator. He chose the word\n\u201cmeme\u201d for a sociocultural replicator due to its\nsimilarities with the word gene:\n\n\nWe need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of\na unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.\n\u2018Mimeme\u2019 comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a\nmonosyllable that sounds a bit like \u2018gene\u2019 (Dawkins 1976:\n192).\n\n\nThe basic idea underlying Dawkins\u2019 proposal is that since\nevolution by natural selection in the biological domain requires\nreplication, it must also be the case in the sociocultural domain, and\nthat imitation, at least in many cases, is the way through which\nsociocultural entities, the memes, replicate.\n\nImportant differences exist between sociocultural evolution and\nbiological evolution (Claidi\u00e8re & Andr\u00e9 2012) [see\nthe entry on\n cultural evolution].\n For example, Dawkins (1976) admits that he is on shaky ground when it\ncomes to the high-fidelity copying required of replicators. Memes seem\nto get changed much more frequently than genes (see Sterelny (2006)\nfor a review). In general, however, it is fair to say that the\nstandards used to evaluate sociocultural transmission are not on par\nwith those used to evaluate biological transmission. An overly\nidealized view of Mendelian genetics is contrasted with a much more\nrealistic view of cultural change. So the criticism goes, one problem\nwith memes is that they do not have discrete boundaries, do not all\ncome in the same size, and, in their functioning, are strongly\ninfluenced by their environments. Genes, so the critics claim, have\nsharp boundaries, are all of the same size, and are immune to\nenvironmental influences. If sociocultural evolution is to be\nevaluated fairly, the same level of criticism must be applied to all\nputative examples of selection, from gene-based selection in\nbiological evolution and the reaction of the immune system to antigens\nto the development of the central nervous system and social learning\n(Hull et al. 2001). The collection of articles in Aunger (2000)\npresent the arguments for and against a memetic approach to\nculture, and a more recent discussion is available in Lewens\n(2015).\n\nDawkins (1976) also places considerable emphasis on human brains as\nthe \u201cvehicles\u201d for memetic evolution. He defines\n\u201cmeme\u201d as an entity capable of being transmitted from one\nbrain to another. Computers are also plausible vehicles for memes, as\nwell as artifacts more generally, which can \u201cstore\u201d and\nthen release information when a copy of the artifact is made by\nemulation (mimesis): that is, without the presence of a\ndemonstration. However, Dawkins\u2019 discussion of memes\nis marred by the pervasiveness of the gene-organism perspective.\nFor example, he defines \u201creplicator\u201d in terms of\ntransmission of information\u2014memes leaping from brain to brain or\nfrom brains to computers and back again. But, memes do not leap from\nbrain to brain or from computer to computer. Their content is\ntransmitted in a variety of ways, including books, audiotapes,\nconversations, and the like. As much as the physical basis changes,\nthe message remains sufficiently unchanged. All instances of this\nmessage are equally memes, not just the ones residing in human brains\nand computers.\n\nSeveral accounts of memetic replication have been proposed in the\nliterature. Some consider that there is no replication in cultural\nevolution, but that memes are \u201cattractor points\u201d in\nculture (Atran 1998). Others consider that the interactor is the meme\nitself (Blackmore 1999) or that the meme is the selected cultural\nheritable information, just as Williams\u2019 \u201cevolutionary\ngene\u201d is the selected genetic heritable information, and the\nmemetic interactor is the repertoire of behaviors it elicits (Wilkins\n1998). One view that has been offered several times is that memes are\nactive neural structures (Aunger 1998, 2002; Delius 1991).\n\nAll the objections to the gene-meme analogy to one side, Dawkins\n(1976: 211) finds the chief difference between genetic and memetic\nchange is that biological evolution is at bottom a war between alleles\nresiding at the same locus: \u201cMemes seem to have nothing\nequivalent to chromosomes and nothing equivalent to alleles\u201d.\nFirst, the usual depiction of alleles residing at the same locus on\nhomologous chromosomes so central to Mendelian genetics is an\noversimplification; but, and more importantly, for at least half of\nthe history of life on earth, replication and selection took place in\nthe absence of chromosomes, meiosis, and the like. If gene-based\nbiological evolution took place for so long in the absence of the\nMendelian apparatus and still does so in many extant organisms, then\ndemanding that memetic evolution proceeds by this very special and\npossibly aberrant sort of inheritance seems too strong. The cost of\nmeiosis remains a serious problem in ordinary biological evolution.\nDemanding that cultural evolution incorporates this same highly\nproblematic element in its own makeup seems strange in the extreme. If\nwe are to develop a general analysis of selection, we must\ndistinguish between essential and contingent features of this\nprocess.\n\nNumerous evolutionary biologists question how fundamental to selection\nthe perspective of alleles at a locus actually is. Almost everyone\nagrees that evolution involves changes in gene frequencies. However,\nfew go on to add that evolution is nothing but changes in\ngene frequencies. When one looks at evolutionary biology, one\ndiscovers that it involves much more than changes in gene frequencies.\nTo be successful, memetic evolution must be fleshed out.\n\nIn 2000, Aunger summarized the disputes between proponents and\nskeptics of the memetic approach as revolving around three\nlevels:\n\n\nwhether culture is properly seen as composed of independently\ntransmitted information units;\nwhether these so-called memes have the necessary qualifications to\nserve as replicators; and\nwhether a Darwinian or selectionist approach such as memetics is\nthe most feasible or desirable form for a science of culture to take.\n(Aunger 2000: 11)\n\n\n\nHowever, over 20 years after the diagnosis, it seems that the\nmemetic approach has, by and large, been abandoned, with some of its\ninsights incorporated into other evolutionary approaches to culture.\nPerhaps the most successful is dual-inheritance theory (Richerson\n& Boyd 2008), also known as gene-culture coevolution. A very\ngeneral characterization of sociocultural evolution has been attempted\nby El Mouden, Andr\u00e9, Morin, and Nettle (2014). This approach,\nwhich relies on the most abstract formalism used by evolutionary\ntheorists\u2014namely, the Price equation (for an introduction to the\nPrice equation see Okasha 2006: Chapter 1)\u2014highlights some\nof the differences between biological and sociocultural evolution, and\nwhy a pure memetic approach seems difficult to implement as a general\nframework.\n4.3 The Extended Replicator\n\nSome of Dawkins\u2019 critics think that genes play too important a\nrole in his notion of replication. Replication, so they argue, can\noccur at other levels of organization as well. Just as Dawkins\nextended the notion of the phenotype, these authors propose to make\nthe notion of replicators more general as well\u2014to extend the\nreplicator so to speak. Dawkins introduced his Extended\nPhenotype conception for two reasons. First, he wanted to extend\nthe notion of a \u201cphenotypic trait\u201d. The sort of nest that\na bird builds or the song that it sings can count as phenotypic traits\njust as much as the shape of its bill. Second, as mentioned earlier,\nDawkins wanted to break the hold that organisms have over how we\nconceptualize the living world. Traits do tend to come bundled into\nreasonably discrete entities; but, for making inferences about the\nevolutionary process, traits can be treated as separate and distinct.\nHowever, as he proceeded, Dawkins eventually decided that extending\nthe phenotype was not enough. He had to bury it. All sorts of\nfascinating mechanisms to one side, what really matters in selection\ntakes place at the level of replicators.\n\nAlthough such critics of Dawkins as Sterelny, Smith, and Dickison\n(1996) declined to join with Dawkins in his demotion of environmental\ninteraction, they did agree with him that replicators are special.\nThey play a special role in development. However, they do not limit\nreplicators to genes, even in biological evolution. Sterelny et al.\npropose to extend the replicator to include nonstandard entities:\n\u201cthe set of developmental resources that are adapted from the\ntransmission of similarity across the generations\u201d (Sterelny\n2001: 338). For example, the sort of burrow that a particular organism\ndigs is influenced by its genetic makeup; however, if these burrows\nare used over and over again, characteristics of these burrows can\nthemselves be viewed as replicators. The effects of these burrows get\npassed on from generation to generation, but not via the DNA.\n\nAs more and more non-DNA replicators, including epigenetic\ninheritance, are acknowledged, Dawkins\u2019 view began to grade into\nthe conception of the Extended Replicator, which Sterelny et al.\n(1996) specify as any non-genetic as well as genetic replicators where\n\u201cgenetic\u201d refers to DNA. These two views are so\ngeneral that any case that can be described in one can be redescribed\nin the other. Differences lie in ease of description. According to\nSterelny et al. (1996), the burrows that some organisms dig can\nfunction as replicators\u2014extended replicators\u2014while Dawkins\nportrays them as instances of extended phenotypes. The contrast is\nbetween selfish burrows and selfish genes for burrowing.\n\nIn the version of replication formulated by Sterelny et al. (1996),\nboth copying and biofunction are crucial. Copying is quite obviously a\ncausal phenomenon, but not any old causal connection will do.\nSimilarity of copies is necessary but not sufficient. These\ncopies must be copies of copies. One copy must produce another copy\nand that copy produce still another copy and so on. For one entity to\nbe a copy of another, it must be the output of a process whose\nbiofunction is to conserve function. The function of copying is to\nproduce from one token another token, which is similar in the relevant\nrespects. Genes fit this definition, but so do lots of examples of\nnon-genetic transmission, such as habitat stability resulting from\nnest site imprinting, the song that a bird learns, and various\nmicroorganism symbionts, not to mention sociocultural\ntransmission.\n5. Challenges to the Replicator\n5.1 Developmental Systems Theory\n\nIn the wake of Oyama\u2019s The Ontogeny of Information\n(1985, 2000) and other work, notably that of Daniel Lehrman (1953) and\nPatrick Bateson (2001), a view of biological evolution has arisen that\nemphasizes development (see also Griffiths & Gray 1994a). In the\nnineteenth century, development was an extremely active research\nprogram. The next great discoveries in biology were predicted to be in\nthe area of development; however, this was not to be. First\nMendelian genetics and then a version of evolutionary theory centered\non population genetics took over biology, and they did so while\navoiding development. Everyone knew that development was central to\nboth evolution and reproduction, but no one could see how to integrate\nthe masses of developmental data available into the emerging synthesis\nof evolutionary biology and genetics. As a result, development was\nleft out of the Modern Synthesis (Beurton, Falk, & Rheinberger\n2000; Gilbert 1991). Considering how central development actually is\nin metazoan and metaphyte biology, the advances made while ignoring it\nare staggering.\n\nEven so, developmental biology continued on its course until, at long\nlast, we seem to understand development well enough to begin\nintegrating it into the rest of biology. On the most conservative\nview, current versions of evolutionary theory can remain largely\nunchanged as development is grafted onto them. On a second view, both\nperspectives are likely to require some modification to achieve this\nintegration. Our understanding of development may have to be modified,\nbut so too for evolutionary theory (Pigliucci & M\u00fcller 2010).\nFinally, at the other extreme, development will all but replace\nevolutionary theory. In their more exuberant moments, some advocates\nof Developmental Systems Theory (DST) seem to be claiming just that.\nJust as some molecular biologists think that molecular biology is\nrapidly replacing all the rest of biology, some advocates of DST argue\nthat developmental theories will simply replace current versions of\nevolutionary theory.\n\nOn some versions of the DST view, genes have no uniquely privileged\nrole in repeated cycles of development (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths\n& Gray 1994b). In fact, no element of the developmental matrix\nplays any privileged causal role\u2014not genes, not organisms, not\nthe environment, not anything. Everything counts as a resource;\nhowever, in particular situations, certain resources will play\nmore important roles than other resources. In rejecting any privileged\nrole for genes, advocates of DST are especially skeptical of one\nparticular role supposedly played by genes\u2014the transmission of\ninformation. According to some, information is central to\ndevelopmentalism, but genes are not the only mechanisms for\ninformation transfer. According to others, information plays no role\nin the emerging developmentalist perspective. The developmental system\nas a whole is the unit of selection [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n If genes have no special role and whole developmental cycles are\nreplicators, as some developmental systems theorists argue, the\ndistinction between replicator and interactor becomes blurred.\n\nIn the continuing debate over developmental versus traditional\ntheories of evolutionary biology, Sterelny et al. (1996) hold a fairly\nconservative position. They agree with the developmentalists that\ngenes play no privileged role in the development of phenotypes from\ngenotypes. Genes do play a role in this process, simply not a\nprivileged role. Genes can serve as a causal bridge from\nphenotype to phenotype, but other entities can do so as well. Genes\nare not the only replicators in biological evolution. The repeated\ncycles in inheritance include many different sorts of constancies and\nrepetitions\u2014genes, cellular machinery, phenotypic traits\nincluding behaviors, and social structures. Information remains\ncentral to selection processes, but genes are not the only carriers of\nsuch information. Genes predict phenotypic characters only in the same\nsense that environmental factors predict them. Sterelny (2000a) has\nargued that developmental considerations require no fundamental\nreevaluation of evolutionary conceptions along the lines of DST.\n5.2 Evolution by Natural Selection without Replication\n\nGodfrey-Smith (2009; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b; Griesemer 2005)\ncontrasts the replicator/interactor approach to natural selection with\na more classical approach. This latter approach is usually given as a\n\u201crecipe\u201d for evolution by natural selection, to use\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s terminology (see also Brandon 1990: 3.1). Ever\nsince Darwin, a number of authors have proposed that for evolution by\nnatural selection to occur, three conditions or ingredients are\nnecessary. A population should exhibit (1) variation that (2)\nleads to differences in fitness between the entities forming the\npopulation [see the entry on\n fitness],\n (3) which are heritable (reviewed in Godfrey-Smith 2007). The most\nfamous version of these recipes is that provided by Lewontin\n(1970).\n\nThere is a difference in emphasis between the two approaches in that\nthe replicator/interactor approach focuses on the entities\nforming the population, while the classical approach provides a\npopulation description of evolutionary change. Another difference\nbetween the two approaches is that under the classical approach,\nreplication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur. In fact, as long as heritability is positive, and the two other\nconditions are satisfied, evolution by natural selection can occur\n(but will not necessarily do so, cf. Godfrey-Smith 2009: 25). An\nabstract definition of heritability (\\(h^2\\))\u2014although by no\nmeans fully general (see Bourrat 2015a, 2022)\u2014is that it\nrepresents the slope of the regression of average offspring character\non parent or mid-parent (in case of sexual species) character [see the\nentry on\n heritability].\n Given that a positive heritability does not entail replication of\ncharacter between parent and offspring, but is rather a special\ncase in which heritability would be exactly 1 in the absence of\nenvironmental variation, the replicator/interactor perspective is\nsubsumed by the classical approach. Godfrey-Smith concurs:\n\n\nFrom this point of view, we can see the replicator analysis as picking\nout a special case of what is covered (or supposed to be covered) by\nthe classical view. (2009: 36; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b)\n\n\nTo see why a lack of replication does not prevent evolution by natural\nselection from occurring, suppose a population of entities exists with\ndifferent sizes, as presented in\n Figure 3(a),\n in which there is selection for larger entities. We assume that the\nentities reproduce asexually in discrete generations and that there is\nno environmental variation. At the parental generation, there are two\ntypes of individuals, with respective sizes of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and 1.\nDue to the selection for size, entities of size \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\nproduce 3 offspring while entities of size 1 produce 4 offspring.\nSuppose now that there is a positive heritability, as defined above,\nso that, on average, offspring resemble more their parent than they\nresemble other entities of the parental generation, as displayed on\n Figure 3(a),\n but only slightly so (\\(h^2 = 0.2\\)). After one generation, although\nthere is no high-fidelity replication, the average size of the\npopulation has changed due to the effect of natural selection.\nThis simple example demonstrates quite straightforwardly that\nreplication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur.\n\nWe said earlier that replication would imply a heritability of exactly\n1 in the absence of environmental variation. Although this is correct,\nthe reverse is not true. In fact, take again a similar population as\nin\n Figure 3(a),\n but this time assume a different pattern of inheritance for the two\ntypes of entities, as displayed in\n Figure 3(b).\n With this pattern of inheritance, although there is no replication,\nentities on average have the exact same character\nvalue as their parent. In the case of the entities of size\n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), some offspring have the exact same character\nas their parent, but that is not required either, as is the case with\nthe entities of size 1, of which none of the offspring has the same\ncharacter as their parent.\n\nOne possible response against regarding the classical approach to\nevolution by natural selection as unconditionally superior to the\nreplicator/interactor approach is to argue that although\nevolution by natural selection can occur without replication, when\nthis happens, the evolutionary change resulting is not a pure\ncase of evolution by natural selection. Rather, it is evolution by\nnatural selection mixed with some other evolutionary processes. A\nrationale for this claim is that the fact that offspring do not\nresemble their parent introduces some variation into the population of\nwhich the origin is not natural selection. In abstract terms, the\nintroduction of variation can be regarded as a form of mutation\n(Bourrat 2019). Under this interpretation, the classical\napproach, on the one hand, and the replicator/interactor approach, on\nthe other hand, simply emphasize different aspects of evolutionary\nexplanations. The classical approach gives us evolutionary\nexplanations in the context of other evolutionary processes\noccurring, while the replicator/interactor approach gives us\nevolutionary explanations of what the effect of natural selection\nwould be in the absence of any other evolutionary process acting in\nthe population\u2014that is, in its pure form. Understood that\nway, the two approaches do not necessarily need to be opposed.\n\nAnother problem with the idea of replication is that it is description\ndependent. Described finely, two objects can never be identical. The\nsame applies to parents and offspring. This, in itself, does not\nrepresent a challenge to the replicator/interactor view. However,\nand more problematically, a coarser grain of description might\nlead parents and offspring to be regarded as copies of one another\nwhen a finer-grained description would show that they are not. Such a\ncoarse-grained way of viewing evolutionary processes has been endorsed\nby some memeticists (see Boudry 2018; Dennett 2017 for explicit\ndefences). However, without a principled way to choose which\ngrain(s) of description ought to be used for the study of a particular\nevolutionary setting, the claim that replication is fundamental to\nevolution by natural selection in the context of other evolutionary\nprocesses occurring becomes arbitrary. This problem is a general one\nin evolutionary theory (see Bourrat, 2020), but is even more\nproblematic in the context of cultural evolution where the\nline between genotype and phenotype is difficult to draw\nand multiple channels of transmission exist (Charbonneau\n& Bourrat 2021; Bourrat & Charbonneau\n2022). \n5.3 Origins of Replicators\n\nAnother challenge to the replicator/interactor approach to evolution\nby natural selection is to see replicators themselves as a\nproduct of natural selection rather than as a necessary\nstarting point. One premise of this argument is that some form of\nnatural selection must have occurred on entities that initially were\nnot replicating, perhaps not even reproducing. This is recognized by\nDawkins, who notes in passing in the second chapter of The Selfish\nGene that \u201cDarwin\u2019s \u2018survival of the\nfittest\u2019 is really a special case of a more general law of\nsurvival of the stable\u201d (Dawkins 1976: 13) and that life\noriginated from selection of molecules for stability.\n\n\n\n\n(a) Population in which there is no replication and a low heritability\n(\\(h^2\\)), yet evolution by natural selection occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Population in which there is no replication, yet heritability is\n1. Evolution by natural selection occurs.\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the idea that\nevolution by natural selection can occur without replication.\n\n\nThe idea that selection can occur without there being replicators was\nfirst introduced as \u201cchemical selection\u201d in line with the\nviews of Oparin, who proposed that coacervates (colloidal droplets)\ncould encapsulate protobiological chemicals and self-replicate without\ngenes through mechanical fission, a view also independently proposed\nby Haldane (Oparin 1936 [1938]; Haldane 1929; see Kolb 2016).\nThis was later extended by the work of Sidney Fox, who showed that\nproteinoid spheres could mechanically reproduce stably (Hsu & Fox\n1976).\n\nIf modern biological systems evolved from molecules that did not have\nthe ability to reproduce, let alone replicate, one might ask: what is\nthe simplest case of evolution by natural selection? It is a case in\nwhich different types of entities have different persistences but do\nnot produce any offspring. In this model, the types with the property\nof persisting longer represent an increasing frequency of the total\npopulation over time. One problem, though in a model of persistence\nalone, is that each time one entity goes out of existence, it is not\nreplaced by another entity; thus, over time, the population size tends\ntowards zero. Although this does not mean that evolution by natural\nselection cannot occur in such populations, this places important\nconstraints on the evolutionary dynamics of this population (Van Valen\n1989). Further, it is possible to regard the ability for a population\nto maintain its size or increase its size as a primordial form of\nadaptation. This idea casts some doubt on the view that paradigmatic\ncases of evolution by natural selection require a\npopulation of entities that reproduce, a view championed by\nGodfrey-Smith (2009). Several authors, following in Van Valen\u2019s\nfootsteps, have recently argued that important cases of evolution\nby natural selection must involve reproduction, and that differential\npersistence with or without differential growth can be sufficient\n(Bouchard 2008, 2011; Bourrat, 2014; Charbonneau 2014;\nDoolittle 2014; Doolittle and Inkpen 2018; for a review, see\nPapale 2021). Nonetheless, assuming a metapopulation, it is clear\nthat populations with the ability to maintain or increase their size\nwould out-compete those that are unable to do so. Thus, the ability\nfor a population to sustain its population size might be regarded as a\nprimordial form of adaptation without which other adaptations would be\nalmost impossible to evolve.\n\nA next \u201cstage\u201d in the evolution from primordial\nentities unable to reproduce to modern biological systems might thus\nhave been for entities to produce new offspring entities (or multiply)\nwithout the ability to pass on their properties reliably. In such a\nsituation, the size of a population could be maintained. The most\nextreme form of that would be to imagine a population of two types in\nwhich each type has the same probability to produce an offspring of\nthe other types as its own type. With entities of the two types having\ndifferent persistence, a modest form of evolution by natural selection\nis still possible. Versions of this model have been proposed by\nWilkins, Stanyon, and Musgrave (2012), Earnshaw-Whyte (2012), and\nBourrat (2015a). Since there is, on average, no more resemblance\nbetween an offspring and its parent than any other entity of the\nparental generation, and evolution by natural selection is still\nobserved in such a scenario, one might think that heritability is,\nstrictly speaking, not a necessary condition for evolution by natural\nselection.\n\nWilkins et al. (2012) argue that, over time, in a reactor with limited\nincoming chemical species, hypercycles (as defined by Eigen et al.\n1991) of reactions will tend to include reaction types that are more\nstable and capture more source molecules and energy than variant\nreaction types, leading to the evolution by natural selection of\nreplicator-like molecules as well as energetically efficient\n\u201cmetabolic\u201d molecules. Recent work in biochemistry has\nadded strength to that suggestion (Altstein 2015). Hence, given that\nno replicator is required for selection (in this case, chemical),\nreplicator molecules can be seen as the outcome of selective\nevolution, not a necessary prior condition for it. In effect, the\nevolution of replicators is the first major transition of evolution,\ndespite the view of Szathm\u00e1ry and Maynard Smith that\nreplicators needed to come first (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry\n1995; Szathm\u00e1ry & Maynard Smith 1997). Bourrat\n(2014) further developed this idea into a series of agent-based\nmodels. He showed that replication is an attractor in populations\nlacking heritability once small random mutations increasing or\ndecreasing the fidelity of character inheritance are introduced.\n5.4 Reproducers\n\nThe works on the origins of replicators tie in with the notion of\nthe reproducer proposed by Griesemer (2000a,b, 2002, 2005;\nWimsatt & Griesemer 2007), although it was published first, based\non a circulated manuscript by Griesemer, by Szathm\u00e1ry and\nMaynard Smith (1997). A reproducer is an entity that develops and has\na material overlap between the \u201cparent\u201d and\n\u201cprogeny\u201d. This causal relationship between parents and\nprogeny is called \u201cprogeneration\u201d, the \u201cincrease in\nnumerically distinct objects of a given kind\u201d. Reproduction is a\ncomposite process of development and progeneration, leading to objects\nthat are themselves capable of development and progeneration. Thus,\nthe reproducer concept extends the notion of a developmental\nsystem.\n\nHere, inheritance is a system property, not a property of\nparts, unless they are also reproducing systems, and is\ndevelopmentally acquired. Organisms do not arise already capable of\nreproduction in the main, but must undergo orderly transitions before\nthey may reproduce.\n\nThe relation between reproducers, and replicators and interactors,\nvaries according to author. Griesemer treats replication as the\nterminal form of reproduction, once coding mechanisms have been\nevolved, which is itself an evolved form of multiplication (Griesemer\n2000a: 76). Unlike Dawkins\u2019 replicator concept, which Griesemer\nbelieves is based on a similarity relationship of\n\u201ccopying\u201d, a reproducer requires material overlap\nof systems. However, replication arises when material overlap evolves\nprogeneration, and progeneration evolves a codical inheritance system,\nas\n Figure 4\n indicates.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Wimsatt and Griesemer\u2019s\nreproducer concept (Wimsatt & Griesemer 2007, 268).\n\n\nOthers, particularly Jablonka and Lamb (2005, 2007), think that\nreproducers are distinct from replication and that some\nepigenetic inheritance systems are reproducers without being\nreplicators. For them, a reproducer is the \u201ctarget of\nselection\u201d [see the entry on\n inheritance systems].\n\nGodfrey-Smith (2009: 83; see also Okasha 2006: 14) takes issue with\nGriesemer\u2019s requirement of \u201cmaterial overlap\u201d as\nbeing too narrow a definiendum of reproducers. He thinks that\nreproducers need not contribute actual material to their progeny\n(where they template for sequences, as in the case of viruses).\nGriesemer believes Godfrey-Smith has over-interpreted the requirement;\nhe is primarily concerned with the idea that parents cause\nprogeny (Griesemer 2014). Charbonneau (2014) furthers the move made by\nGodfrey-Smith, arguing that the existence of parent-offspring\nlineages is unnecessary for evolution by natural selection to\noccur.\n\nAn aspect of reproducers sensu lato that has fascinated some\nis that it does not imply a particular level of reproduction or\nprogeneration; indeed, Szathm\u00e1ry and Maynard Smith consider\nthat the major transitions of evolution each involve an evolved mode\nof progeneration that is more inclusive or novel than what it evolved\nfrom (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995; Szathm\u00e1ry\n& Maynard Smith 1997).\n\nGodfrey-Smith also proposed a taxonomy of reproducers, dividing them\ninto simple, collective, and scaffolded (Godfrey-Smith\n2009: 87ff). Simple reproducers are\n\n\nentities that can reproduce \u2026 using their own machinery, in\nconjunction with external sources of energy and raw materials.\n\n\nHe gives an example of a bacterial cell. Collective reproducers\n\n\n\u2026 are reproducing entities with parts that themselves have the\ncapacity to reproduce, where the parts do so largely through their own\nresources rather than the coordinated activity as a whole.\n\n\nAnd, scaffolded reproducers\n\n\nare entities which get reproduced as part of the reproduction of some\nlarger unit (a simple reproducer), or that are reproduced by some\nother entity.\n\n\nExamples here includes viruses and chromosomes. Godfrey-Smith applies\nthe scaffolded reproducer category to sociocultural evolution.\n\nThe notion of reproducers has also been applied to speciation and\ncladogenesis (A. Hamilton & Haber 2006). While it may apply to\npopulations, given that taxa do not share the kind of causal unity\nfound in populations and organisms, it is unlikely to apply to species\nor supraspecific taxa, and macroevolution in general.\n\nRecently, Veigl, Suarez, and Stencel (2022) have extended\nGriesemer\u2019s reproducer. In lieu of \u201creproducer\u201d, they\npropose the notion of the \u201creconstitutor\u201d, which is a\nstructure that is \u201cre-produced\u201d at\nevery generation irrespectively of the causal origin of the\nreconstruction. While, as presented above, the idea that\nmaterial overlap is a necessary condition for an entity to\nbe a reproducer and, consequently, to be an entity involved\nin a process of evolution by natural selection seems overly\nrestrictive, the notion proposed by Veigl et al. appears overly\nliberal for at least two reasons. First, without looking\nfor the causal connections between entities involved in\nevolution by natural selection across generations, that is, what\nis transmitted, predicting an evolutionary trajectory at the level of\nthese entities would be difficult. Second, the idea of the\nreconstitutor erases an important distinction made in evolutionary\ntheory between two forms of evolution: namely,\ntransformational and variational evolution (see Lewontin 1983).\nThese two forms of evolution are exemplified by change due\nto mutation and changes due to selection, respectively. The\ndistinction between mutation and selection, along with drift, is\nat the heart of population genetics and general formulations of\nevolutionary theory such as the Price equation (e.g., Frank 2012, who\nemphasize the distinction between \u201cselection\u201d and \u201ctransmission\u201d as\ntwo important and distinct evolutionary processes). To adopt\nthe reconstitutor as a fundamental evolutionary entity would\nrequire extremely strong arguments against the view that mutation and\nselection described at one level are fundamentally different\nevolutionary processes or, at the very least, clear advantages\nfor the notion of the reconstitutor over the reproducer.\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe idea that evolution by natural selection requires the existence of\nreplicators has been a very useful heuristic in evolutionary\nbiology, but also a way of motivating the application of an\nevolutionary thinking beyond the boundaries of evolutionary biology.\nWe started by showing how the notion of gene can be abstracted away\nfrom its physical basis and characterized in purely informational\nterms. We then showed how Dawkins and Hull pursued this abstraction\nand attempted to free the gene from its biological substrate. This\nmotivated responses both from proponents of the replicator concept,\nwho furthered the abstraction, and also critics. As successful and\ninspiring as such an abstraction has been, it should not be reified:\nevolution by natural selection and adaptation can occur even in the\nabsence of replicators. High fidelity certainly facilitates adaptive\nevolution, but this might be because replicators are themselves the\nproduct of evolution rather than necessary for it.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["\u00c5gren, Arvid J., 2021, <em>The Gene\u2019s-Eye View of\nEvolution</em>, Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press.", "Altstein, Anatoly D., 2015, \u201cThe Progene Hypothesis: The\nNucleoprotein World and How Life Began\u201d, <em>Biology\nDirect</em>, 10(1): 67. doi:10.1186/s13062-015-0096-z", "Atran, Scott, 1998, \u201cFolk Biology and the Anthropology of\nScience: Cognitive Universals and the Cultural Particulars\u201d,\n<em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>, 21(4): 547\u2013609.\ndoi:10.1017/S0140525X98001277", "Aunger, Robert, 1998, \u201cThe\u2018Core Meme\u2019\nMeme\u201d, <em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>, 21(4):\n569\u2013570. doi:10.1017/S0140525X98221273", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000, <em>Darwinizing Culture: The Status\nof Memetics as a Science</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.\ndoi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780192632449.001.0001", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2002, <em>The Electric Meme: A New Theory\nof How We Think</em>, New York: Free Press.", "Bateson, Patrick, 2001, \u201cBehavioral Development and\nDarwinian Evolution\u201d, in Oyama et al. 2001: 149\u2013166.", "Bergstrom, Carl and Martin Rosvall, 2011, \u201cThe Transmission\nSense of Information\u201d, <em>Biology and Philosophy</em>, 26(2):\n159\u2013176. doi:10.1007/s10539-009-9180-z", "Beurton, Peter, Raphael Falk, and Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger\n(eds), 2000, <em>The Concept of the Gene in Development and Evolution:\nHistorical and Epistemological Perspectives</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511527296", "Blackmore, Susan J., 1999, <em>The Meme Machine</em>, Oxford; New\nYork: Oxford University Press.", "Bouchard, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, 2008, \u201cCausal Processes,\nFitness, and the Differential Persistence of Lineages\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 75(5): 560\u2013570.\ndoi:10.1086/594507", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2011, \u201cDarwinism Without Populations:\nA More Inclusive Understanding of the \u2018Survival of the\nFittest\u2019\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of\nScience Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and\nBiomedical Sciences</em>, 42(1): 106\u2013114.\ndoi:10.1016/j.shpsc.2010.11.002", "Boudry, Maarten, 2018, \u201cReplicate after Reading: On the\nExtraction and Evocation of Cultural Information\u201d, <em>Biology\n&amp; Philosophy</em>, 33(3): 27. doi:10.1007/s10539-018-9637-z", "Bourrat, Pierrick, 2014, \u201cFrom Survivors to Replicators:\nEvolution by Natural Selection Revisited\u201d, <em>Biology and\nPhilosophy</em>, 29(4): 517\u2013538.\ndoi:10.1007/s10539-013-9383-1", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2015a, \u201cHow to Read\n\u2018Heritability\u2019 in the Recipe Approach to Natural\nSelection\u201d, <em>The British Journal for the Philosophy of\nScience</em>, 66(4): 883\u2013903. doi:10.1093/bjps/axu015", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2015b, \u201cLevels of Selection Are\nArtefacts of Different Fitness Temporal Measures\u201d,\n<em>Ratio</em>, 28(1): 40\u201350. doi:10.1111/rati.12053", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2019, \u201cIn What Sense Can There Be\nEvolution by Natural Selection without Perfect Inheritance?\u201d,\n<em>International Studies in the Philosophy of Science</em>, 32(1):\n39\u201377. doi:10.1080/02698595.2019.1623485", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2020, \u201cNatural Selection and the\nReference Grain Problem\u201d, <em>Studies in History and\nPhilosophy of Science</em> (Part A), 80: 1\u20138.\ndoi:10.1016/j.shpsa.2019.03.003", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2021, <em>Facts, Conventions, and the\nLevels of Selection</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\ndoi:10.1017/9781108885812", "Bourrat, Pierrick, and Mathieu Charbonneau,\n2022, \u201cGrains of Description in Biological and Cultural\nTransmission\u201d, <em>Journal of Cognition and Culture</em>,\n22(3\u20134): 185\u2013202. doi:10.1163/15685373-12340131", "Brandon, Robert N., 1990, <em>Adaptation and Environment</em>,\nPrinceton, NJ: Princeton University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996, <em>Concepts and Methods in\nEvolutionary Biology</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Brookes, Bertram C., 1956, \u201cAn Introduction to the\nMathematical Theory of Information\u201d, <em>The Mathematical\nGazette</em>, 40(333): 170\u2013180. doi:10.2307/3608805", "Brooks, Daniel R. and Edward O.
