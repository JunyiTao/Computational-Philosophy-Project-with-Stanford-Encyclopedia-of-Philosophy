The widespread use of abstraction (that is,\nincorporating some but not all of the relevant parameters into\nscientific descriptions) and idealization (distorting the natures of\ncertain parameters) suggests that even many of our best theories and\nmodels are not strictly correct. The common realist contention that\ntheories can be viewed as gradually converging on the truth as\nscientific inquiry advances suggests that such progress is amenable to\nassessment or measurement in some way, if only in principle. And even\nfor realists who are not convergentists as such, the importance of\ncashing out the metaphor of theories being close to the truth is\npressing in the face of antirealist assertions to the effect that the\nmetaphor is empty. The challenge to make good on the metaphor and\nexplicate, in precise terms, what approximate truth could be, is one\nsource of skepticism about realism. Two broad strategies have emerged\nin response to this challenge: attempts to quantify approximate truth\nby formally defining the concept and the related notion of relative\napproximate truth; and attempts to explicate the concept\ninformally.\n\nThe formal route was inaugurated by Popper (1972: 231\u2013236), who\ndefined relative orderings of \u201cverisimilitude\u201d (literally,\n\u201clikeness to truth\u201d) between theories in a given domain\nover time by means of a comparison of their true and false\nconsequences. D. Miller (1974) and Tich\u00fd (1974) proved that\nthere is a technical problem with this account, however, yielding the\nconsequence that in order for theory A to have greater\nverisimilitude than theory B, A must be true\nsimpliciter, which leaves the realist desideratum of\nexplaining how strictly false theories can differ with respect to\napproximate truth unsatisfied (see also Oddie 1986a). Another formal\naccount is the possible worlds approach (also called the\n\u201csimilarity\u201d approach), according to which the truth\nconditions of a theory are identified with the set of possible worlds\nin which it is true, and \u201ctruth-likeness\u201d is calculated by\nmeans of a function that measures the average or some other\nmathematical \u201cdistance\u201d between the actual world and the\nworlds in that set, thereby facilitating orderings of theories with\nrespect to truth-likeness (Tich\u00fd 1976, 1978; Oddie 1986b;\nNiiniluoto 1987, 1998; for critiques, see D. Miller 1976 and Aronson\n1990). One last attempt to formalize approximate truth is the type\nhierarchies approach, which analyzes truth-likeness in terms of\nsimilarity relationships between nodes in tree-structured graphs of\ntypes and subtypes representing scientific concepts on the one hand,\nand the entities in the world they putatively represent on the other\n(Aronson 1990; Aronson, Harr\u00e9, & Way 1994: 15\u201349; for\na critique, see Psillos 1999: 270\u2013273).\n\nLess formally and perhaps more typically, realists have attempted to\nexplicate approximate truth in qualitative terms. One common\nsuggestion is that a theory may be considered more approximately true\nthan one that preceded it if the earlier theory can be described as a\n\u201climiting case\u201d of the later one. The idea of limiting\ncases and inter-theory relations more generally is elaborated by Post\n(1971; see also French & Kamminga 1993), who argues that certain\nheuristic principles in science yield theories that\n\u201cconserve\u201d the successful parts of their predecessors. His\n\u201cGeneral Correspondence Principle\u201d states that later\ntheories commonly account for the successes of their predecessors by\n\u201cdegenerating\u201d into earlier theories in domains in which\nthe earlier ones are well confirmed. Hence, for example, the often\ncited claim that certain equations in relativistic physics degenerate\ninto the corresponding equations in classical physics in the limit, as\nvelocity tends to zero. The realist may then contend that later\ntheories offer more approximately true descriptions of the relevant\nsubject matter, and that the ways in which they do this can be\nilluminated in part by studying the ways in which they build on the\nlimiting cases represented by their predecessors. (For further takes\non approximate truth, see Leplin 1981; Boyd 1990; Weston 1992; Smith\n1998; Chakravartty 2010, and Northcott 2013.)\n",
