    "main_text": "Memory and Justification || Foundationalism and Coherentism\n2.1 Foundationalism and Coherentism\n\nOne way to illuminate memory\u2019s justificatory role is to turn the\nspotlight to the structure of justification. Some of what we\njustifiedly believe helps us justifiedly believe other things. But,\naccording to foundationalism, not all that justifies stands in need of\njustification itself. There are foundations for our justification,\nplaces where we need look for no further support. If there is\nfoundational justification, memory might provide some of it. Perhaps\nmemory is not relevantly different from perception, which is a good\ncandidate for being a basic source of justification. Visual perception\nprovides justification for believing how spatially distant things are.\nMemory simply provides justification for believing how temporally\ndistant things are (Taylor 1956).\n\nOr memory might not provide foundational support. Instead all support\nit gives might come from other justifiers; it does not sit at the\nbottom of the structure. Most contemporary epistemology accepts\nfoundationalism (see entry on\n foundationalist theories of justification).\n So, several sections below help locate memory in the foundationalist\nstructure. But there are alternatives to foundationalism.\n\nOne alternative is coherentism, according to which, roughly, a belief\nis justified if and only if it coheres with other beliefs (see entry\non\n coherentist theories of justification).\n Beliefs that fit together well are mutually supporting, or supporting\nas a set. Coherentism is not as popular as it once was, but still has\nsome advocates (Poston 2014). But even if coherentism is false,\ncoherence relations may still matter for justification. Coherence\nmight not create justification, but it may increase any already\npresent (Lewis 1946). Thanks to memory you might have several beliefs\nthat all fit together. If these beliefs are already justified, their\nfitting together could boost their justification. And even if\ncoherence does not help, incoherence may hurt (Audi 1995; Olsson\n2017). A poor fit among recollections might eliminate justification\nthat memory would otherwise help provide.\n",
