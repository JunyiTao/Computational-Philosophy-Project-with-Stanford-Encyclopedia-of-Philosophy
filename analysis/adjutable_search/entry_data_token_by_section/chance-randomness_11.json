The simplest way in which chance is\nhistory-dependent is when the conditions that may produce a certain\nevent change over time:\n\n\nSuppose you enter a labyrinth at 11:00 a.m., planning to choose your\nturn whenever you come to a branch point by tossing a coin. When you\nenter at 11:00, you may have a 42% chance of reaching the center by\nnoon. But in the first half hour you may stray into a region from\nwhich it is hard to reach the center, so that by 11:30 your chance of\nreaching the center by noon has fallen to 26%. But then you turn\nlucky; by 11:45 you are not far from the center and your chance of\nreaching it by noon is 78%. At 11:49 you reach the center; then and\nforevermore your chance of reaching it by noon is 100%. (Lewis, 1980:\n91)\n\n\nBut there are more complicated types of history-dependence. In Lewis\u2019\nexample, the property which changes to alter the chances is how close\nthe agent is to the centre. But there are cases where the property\nwhich changes is a previous outcome of the very same process. Indeed,\nany process in which successive outcomes of repeated trials are\nnot probabilistically independent will have this feature.\n\n\nOne example of chance without randomness involves an unbiased urn\nwhere balls are drawn without replacement. Each draw (with the\nexception of the last) is an event which happens by chance, but the\nsequence of outcomes will not be random (because the first half of the\nsequence will carry significant information about the composition of\nthe second half, which may aid compressibility). But a more compelling\nexample is found in stochastic processes in which the chances of future\noutcomes depend on past outcomes. One well-known class of such process\nare Markov chains, which produce a discrete sequence of outcomes with\nthe property that the value of an outcome is dependent on the value of\nthe immediately prior outcome (but that immediately prior outcome\nscreens off the rest of the history). A binary Markov chain might be\nthe weather (Gates and Tong 1976): if the two possible outcomes are\n\u2018sunny\u2019 and \u2018rainy\u2019, it is plausible to suppose\nthat whether tomorrow is rainy depends on whether today was rainy (a\nrainy day is more likely to be preceded by another rainy day); but\nknowing that today was rainy arguably makes yesterday\u2019s weather\nirrelevant.\n\n\nIf a Markov chain is the correct model of a process, then even when\nthe individual trial outcomes happen by chance, we should expect the\nentire sequence of repeated trials to be non-random. In the weather\ncase just discussed, we should expect a sunny day to be followed by a\nsunny day, and a rainy day by a rainy one. In our notation 11 and 00\nshould be more frequent than 10 or 01. But the condition of Borel\nnormality, which all random sequences obey, entails that every finite\nsequence of outcomes of equal length should have equal frequency in the\nsequence. So no Borel normal sequence, and hence no random sequence,\ncan model the sequence of outcomes of a Markov chain, even though each\noutcome happens by chance.\n",
