    "main_text": "Range of Meanings and Uses || Sublimated vengeance\n3.8 Sublimated vengeance\n\nRetributivism has also often been conflated with revenge or the desire\nfor vengeance. But the two concepts should not be confused. Robert\nNozick drew five distinctions between the two, including that revenge\nis personal but retribution is not, and that\n\n\n[r]evenge involves a particular emotional tone, pleasure in the\nsuffering of another, while retribution either need involve no\nemotional tone, or involves another one, namely, pleasure at justice\nbeing done. (1981: 367)\n\n\nThese imply that even if no one wanted to take revenge on a wrongdoer,\nthere could still be a retributive reason to punish her (Moore 1997:\n89; for a skeptical take on these distinctions, see Fassin 2018:\n36).\n\nThese distinctions do not imply that the desire for revenge plays no\nmotivational role leading people to value retributive justice. Perhaps\nretributive justice is the sublimated, generalized version of the\nthirst for revenge. The two are nonetheless different. As George\nFletcher wrote (2000: 417), retributivism \u201cis not to be\nidentified with vengeance or revenge, any more than love is to be\nidentified with lust\u201d.\n",
