    "main_text": "Psychology || Intellect and Intellection\n4.1 Intellect and Intellection\n\nIn a few instances in his Book of Definitions, Israeli\ndiverges from models given by his forerunner al-Kindi. Although\nIsraeli posits a first intellect and a second\nintellect, Israeli describes three hypostases of intellect.\nFirst intellect, the entity which emerges from the\nconjunction of first matter and first form, contains all subsequent\nforms, which emanate from the first intellect and determine\nthe specificality of all substances and knows all things eternally.\nThe secondary hypostasis of intellect is actually in the rational\nsoul, and is potential intellect before it passes into the actual\nintellect of the first intellect. The \u201csecond intellect\u201d\n(actually the third hypostasis of intellect) is a faculty of the\nrational soul, which via sense perception and imagination (the\n\u201cinternal senses\u201d) conveys information to the higher\nhypostasis in the rational soul. The second intellect of the rational\nsoul unites with the objects of its intellection in a spiritual,\nnon-corporeal sense and similarly, upon conveyance of the intellection\nto the higher intellect of the rational soul, the higher hypostasis of\nintellect within the rational soul also spiritually unites with the\nobjects of its intellection. (Altmann and Stern, Isaac\nIsraeli, pp. 36\u20137) Since Israeli here diverges from\nal-Kindi, Stern accuses Israeli of a clumsy misreading of the latter.\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 39) However, since Israeli\u2019s\ndescription of internal senses largely mirrors the description in John\nof Damascus\u2019 De Fide Orthodoxa, (Book II, Chapter 20)\nit is likely that Israeli derived his overall schema of intellection\nfrom another source. While Stern rejected the connection between the\ntext of John of Damascus and Israeli (Isaac Israeli, p. 59), Harry\nWolfson rejoined that De Fida Orthodoxa was available in\nArabic translation in the tenth century (Wolfson, 1961, p. 279).\nFurther, it is possible that Israeli was drew his conception from\nanother lost source common to himself and John of Damascus, or from a\nlost Arabic commentator on the latter.\n",
