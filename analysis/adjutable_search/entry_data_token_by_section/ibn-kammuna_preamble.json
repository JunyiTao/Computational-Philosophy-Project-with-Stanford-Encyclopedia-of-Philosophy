    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe centuries following the remarkable achievement of Ibn Sina\n(Avicenna; d. 1037) were a remarkably creative period in the sciences\nand philosophy. Sa\u2018d ibn Mansur Ibn Kamm\u016bna, a Jew from Baghdad,\nactively participated in the lively discourse of his day. In his\ncopious writings he takes up the entire gamut of philosophical issues\ndiscussed by his contemporaries. Editions, translations and studies of\nworks by Ibn Kamm\u016bna and other thinkers of the time have appeared in\nrecent years. Nonetheless, it remains\ndifficult at this stage to contextualize Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s work, or to\ndecide wherein lies his most noteworthy contribution.\n\nNo topic so engaged Ibn Kamm\u016bna more than the study of the human soul,\nespecially its proper characterization and the proofs for its survival\nafter the death of the body. So, after first surveying Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s\nbiography, writings, and image, we will present Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s views on\nthe soul and its afterlife. Then we shall follow the thread of one\nconcept whose significance for the thought of the age has been firmly\nestablished, namely, h\u0323ads [most usually translated as\n\u201cintuition\u201d], through his major writings. At the very\nleast, this shall afford us a glimpse at the way Ibn Kamm\u016bna handles a\nkey notion of psychology, epistemology, and the theory of prophecy, in\nvarious literary formats. Following that, we will present the\nfirst-ever survey of his religious ethics; the key texts have only\nrecently been published. Finally, we will have a look at some of the\nsophistries and paradoxes that are attributed to him.\n\n\nAll agree that the publication of editions of Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s writings\n(all of which are in Arabic) are a necessary first step in the study\nof his contribution. There is far less agreement as to how to assess\nthe worth of editions, as well as the need or lack thereof for redoing\neditions that are already available. Discussion of these and related\nissues are essential to our topic, and bear upon the proper\nunderstanding of Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s position on the issues of his day. With\nthis in mind, we will end with a short, critical discussion of some\neditions that have appeared, just before the bibliography.\n",
