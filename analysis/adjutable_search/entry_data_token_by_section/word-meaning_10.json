    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language || Internalism\n3.4 Internalism\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Loar 1981; McGinn 1982; Block 1986) objected\nto the reduction of lexical meaning to reference, or to\nnon-psychological factors that are alleged to determine reference. In\ntheir view, there are two aspects of meaning (more generally, of\ncontent): the narrow aspect, that captures the intuition that\n\u2018water\u2019 has the same meaning in both Earthian and\nTwin-Earthian English, and the wide aspect, that captures the\nexternalist intuition that \u2018water\u2019 picks out different\nsubstances in the two worlds. The wide notion is required to account\nfor the difference in reference between English and Twin-English\n\u2018water\u2019; the narrow notion is needed, first and foremost,\nto account for the relation between a subject\u2019s beliefs and her\nbehavior. The idea is that how an object of reference is\ndescribed (not just which object one refers to) can make a difference\nin determining behavior. Oedipus married Jocasta because he thought he\nwas marrying the queen of Thebes, not his mother, though as a matter\nof fact Jocasta was his mother. This applies to words of all\ncategories: someone may believe that water quenches thirst without\nbelieving that H2O does; Lois Lane believed that Superman\nwas a superhero but she definitely did not believe the same of her\ncolleague Clark Kent, so she behaved one way to the man she identified\nas Superman and another way to the man she identified as Clark Kent\n(though they were the same man). Theorists that countenance these two\ncomponents of meaning and content usually identify the narrow aspect\nwith the inferential or conceptual role of an\nexpression e, i.e., with the aspect of e that\ncontributes to determine the inferential relations between sentences\ncontaining an occurrence of e and other sentences. Crucially,\nthe two aspects are independent: neither determines the other. The\nstress on the independence of the two factors also characterizes more\nrecent versions of so-called \u201cdual aspect\u201d theories, such\nas Chalmers (1996, 2002).\n\nWhile dual theorists agree with Putnam\u2019s claim that some aspects\nof meaning are not \u201cin the head\u201d, others have opted for\nplain internalism. For example, Segal (2000) rejected the intuitions\nthat are usually associated with the Twin-Earth cases by arguing that\nmeaning (and content in general) \u201clocally supervenes\u201d on a\nsubject\u2019s intrinsic physical properties. But the most\ninfluential critic of externalism has undoubtedly been Chomsky (2000).\nFirst, he argued that much of the alleged support for externalism\ncomes in fact from \u201cintuitions\u201d about words\u2019\nreference in this or that circumstance. But \u2018reference\u2019\n(and the verb \u2018refer\u2019 as used by philosophers) is a\ntechnical term, not an ordinary word, hence we have no more intuitions\nabout reference than we have about tensors or c-command. Second, if we\nlook at how words such as \u2018water\u2019 are applied in ordinary\ncircumstances, we find that speakers may call \u2018water\u2019\nliquids that contain a smaller proportion of H2O than other\nliquids they do not call \u2018water\u2019 (e.g., tea): our use of\n\u2018water\u2019 does not appear to be governed by hypotheses about\nmicrostructure. According to Chomsky, it may well be that progress in\nthe scientific study of the language faculty will allow us to\nunderstand in what respects one\u2019s picture of the world is framed\nin terms of things selected and individuated by properties of the\nlexicon, or involves entities and relationships describable by the\nresources of the language faculty. Some semantic properties\ndo appear to be integrated with other aspects of language. However,\nso-called \u201cnatural kind words\u201d (which in fact have little\nto do with kinds in nature, Chomsky claims) may do little more than\nindicating \u201cpositions in belief systems\u201d: studying them\nmay be of some interest for \u201cethnoscience\u201d, surely not for\na science of language. Along similar lines, others have maintained\nthat the genuine semantic properties of linguistic expressions should\nbe regarded as part of syntax, and that they constrain but do not\ndetermine truth conditions (e.g., Pietroski 2005, 2010). Hence, the\nconnection between meaning and truth conditions (and reference) may be\nsignificantly looser than assumed by many philosophers.\n",
