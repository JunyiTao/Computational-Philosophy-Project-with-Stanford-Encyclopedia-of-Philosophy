    "main_text": "Applications\n10. Applications\n\nAs indicated at the outset, applications of computational\nlinguistics techniques range from those minimally dependent on\nlinguistic structure and meaning, such as document retrieval and\nclustering, to those that attain some level of competence in\ncomprehending and using language, such as dialogue agents that provide\nhelp and information in limited domains like personal scheduling,\nflight booking, or help desks, and intelligent tutoring systems. In the\nfollowing we enumerate some of these applications. In several cases\n(especially machine translation) we have already provided considerable\ndetail, but the intent here is to provide a bird's eye view of\nthe state of the art, rather than technical elucidations.\nWith the advent of ubiquitous computing, it has become increasingly\ndifficult to provide a systematic categorization of NLP applications:\nKeyword-based retrieval of documents (or snippets) and database access\nare integrated into some dialogue agents and many voice-based services;\nanimated dialogue agents interact with users both in tutoring systems\nand games; chatbot techniques are incorporated into various useful or\nentertaining agents as a backends; and language-enabled robots, though\ndistinctive in combining vision and action with language, are gradually\nbeing equipped with web access, QA abilities, tutorial functions, and\nno doubt eventually with collaborative problem solving abilities. Thus\nthe application categories in the subsections that follow, rather than\nbeing mutually exclusive, are ever more interwined in practice.\n\n",
