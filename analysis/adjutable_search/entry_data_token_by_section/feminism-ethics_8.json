Elena Flores Ru\u00edz observes that \u201cprofessional\nphilosophy sleepwalks; its somnambulatory practices stroll\nsilently, policing checkpoints without the burden of consciousness of\nits actions and practices\u201d (2014, 199). In other words,\nphilosophers have at times presumed that they speak for many without\nsufficient attention to their own presumptions. Ru\u00edz\u2019s\nclaim is akin to Rosemarie Tong\u2019s observation made decades\nearlier, that traditional ethical theory demonstrates \u201ca sleepy\ninattentiveness to women\u2019s concerns\u201d (1993, 160). The\nprovocation to alertness is evident in feminist critiques of\ntraditional ethical theories such as deontology, consequentialism,\nsocial contract theory, and virtue ethics. Some feminist ethicists\nsympathetically extend canonical work to concerns that male theorists\ndid not address, while other feminist ethicists resoundingly reject\ntraditional ethical theories because the theories rely on a conception\nof moral agency or moral value with which they disagree.\n2.4.1 Deontology, rights, and duties\n\nSome feminist ethicists endorse deontological moral theories on the\ngrounds that granting women\u2014who have been subordinated in\nprivate and public spheres\u2014the same rights routinely granted to\nmen in positions of power would enable women\u2019s freedom and\nflourishing, especially in contexts of political liberalism. Feminist\nethicists have long argued that we should acknowledge women\u2019s\nequal capacities for moral agency and extend human rights to them\n(Astell 1694; Wollstonecraft 1792; Stanton [1848] 1997; Mill [1869]\n1987; Nussbaum 1999; Baehr 2004; Stone-Mediatore 2004; Hay 2013).\nWhile building on existing frameworks of liberalism, rights theory,\nand deontology, feminist ethicists have argued for granting rights\nwhere they have been previously neglected (Brennan 2010). They have\nargued for rights in the issues of enfranchisement (Truth [1867]\n1995), reproduction (Steinbock 1994), abortion (Thomson 1971), bodily\nintegrity (Varden 2012), women\u2019s and non-heterosexual\npeople\u2019s sexuality (Goldman 2012; Cuomo 2007), sexual harassment\n(Superson 1993), pornography (Easton 1995), violence against women\n(Dauer and Gomez 2006), rape (MacKinnon 2006), and more. While\nrecognizing limits to the universality of women\u2019s experiences,\nfeminist philosophers have argued for global human rights as a remedy\nfor gendered oppression and dehumanization (Cudd 2005; Meyers\n2016).\n\nFeminist criticism of duty-centered frameworks, or, deontology,\ninclude those articulated by authors of the ethic of care, who argue\nagainst an ethic of duty, especially Kantian ethics, on several\ngrounds. First, they claim that it proceeds from absolutist and\nuniversal principles which are unduly prioritized over consideration\nof the material contexts informing embodied experiences,\nparticularities, and relationships. Second, they claim that it\ninaccurately separates capacities for rationality from capacities for\nemotion, and that it wrongly describes the latter as morally\nuninformative or worthless most likely because of their traditional\nassociation with women or femininity (Noddings 1984; Held 1993; Slote\n2007). Moreover, an ethic of duty is likely to overly idealize moral\nagents\u2019 capacities for rationality and choice (Tronto 1995;\nTessman 2015). Some feminist ethicists embrace forms of obligation yet\nreject Kantian deontology when it denies the possibility of moral\ndilemmas (Tessman 2015). Feminists who argue that duties are socially\nconstructed, rather than a priori, ground the nature of obligations in\nthe normative practices of the nonideal world (Walker 1998; Walker\n2003).\n\nTransnational feminists, scholars of intersectionality, and\npostcolonial feminists argue that feminist advocates of global human\nrights routinely impose their own cultural expectations and regional\npractices upon the women who are purportedly the objects of their\nconcern (Mohanty 1997; Narayan 1997; Narayan 2002; Silvey 2009;\nNarayan 2013; Khader 2018a; Khader 2018b). Critical analyses of some\nfeminist deontologists\u2019 concerns include arguments that\nuniversal morals, rights, and duties are not the best bulwark against\nrelativist condonation of any and all possible treatments of women and\nsubordinated people (Khader 2018b) and suggest that advocacy of human\nrights is perhaps well-intentioned but \u201centangled with\nimperialist precommitments in the contemporary West\u201d (Khader\n2018a, 19).\n2.4.2 Consequentialism and utilitarianism\n\nSince John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill argued both for\nutilitarianism and against the subjection of women, one could say that\nthere have been feminists as long as there have been utilitarians. In\nThe Subjection of Women ([1869] 1987), Mill argues that the\ndesirable outcome of human moral progress generally is hindered by\nwomen\u2019s legal and social subordination. He adds that not only\neach woman\u2019s, but each man\u2019s personal moral character is\ndirectly harmed by the injustice of unequal social arrangements (Okin\n2005). Mill expresses special concern that \u201cthe object of being\nattractive to men had \u2026 become the polar star of feminine\neducation and formation of character,\u201d an immoral\n\u201cinfluence over the minds of women\u201d (Mill [1869] 1987,\n28\u201329), as well as an immoral influence on the understandings of\nthe boys and girls that such women raise. Consistent with the\nutilitarian principle that everyone counts equally and no single\nperson\u2019s preferences count more than another\u2019s, Mill\nargues that men and women are fundamentally equal in their capacities\nfor higher and lower pleasures and, arguably, in their\nresponsibilities and interests (Mendus 1994). Harriet Taylor likewise\nargues in The Enfranchisement of Women for the moral\nimprovement of humankind generally and \u201cthe elevation of\ncharacter [and] intellect\u201d that would permit each woman and man\nto be both morally better and happier, which are overlapping and\nimportant considerations to Taylor (1998, 65).\n\nContemporary feminist ethicists who address utilitarianism either\ncritique Mill\u2019s work in particular (Annas 1977; Mendus 1994;\nMorales 2005), or defend a feminist version of consequentialism\n(Driver 2005; Gardner 2012), or apply consequentialist aims to\nfeminist issues (Tulloch 2005; Dea 2016b). Some consequentialist\nfeminists provide reasons for thinking that utilitarianism can\naccommodate feminist aims because it is responsive to empirical\ninformation, can accommodate the value of relationships in good lives,\nand is appreciative of distinctive vulnerabilities (Driver 2005).\n\nCritics of utilitarianism include those who specifically resist the\nexpectation of utilitarian impartiality, insofar as impartiality in\ndecision-making ignores emotional connections or personal\nrelationships with particular beings. Feminists have advanced\ncriticisms of impartiality from the points of view of care ethics\n(Noddings 1984; Held 2006; Ruddick 1989), ecofeminist or environmental\nethics (Adams 1990; Donovan 1990; George 1994; Warren 2000), and\nanalytical social ethics (Baier 1994; Friedman 1994). Impartiality may\nyield implausible requirements to value the well-being of all equally\nregardless of one\u2019s commitments, material circumstances in a\nnonideal world, or obligations of caring (Walker 1998; Walker 2003).\nImpartiality as a desirable quality of moral agents may overly\nidealize moral agency (Tessman 2015) or tacitly presume a biased\nperspective in favor of adult, racially privileged, masculine agents\nin a formal or public sphere whose decisions are unencumbered by\nrelationships of unequal power (Kittay 1999).\n\nSome feminists criticize consequentialism for failing to capture the\nqualitatively problematic nature of oppressions that are not reducible\nto harms (Frye 1983; Card 1996; Young 2009). For example, Card argues\nthat even if certain behavior does not produce more harm than good,\nits symbolism could violate one\u2019s dignity. Her example is the\ncase of women being barred from Harvard\u2019s Lamont Law library\neven when helpful male classmates provided them photocopies of course\nreadings (2002, 104\u2013105). Card also objects on Rawlsian grounds\nthat the wrongness of slavery was not the balance of benefits and\nharms, contra consequentialism, but the fact that trade-offs could\nnever justify slavery (2002, 57).\n\nAnti-imperialist and non-Western feminists argue that Mill\u2019s\nviews in particular purport to be universal but include \u201cWestern\nEuropean biases and instrumental reasoning\u201d that establish\n\u201cproblematic rhetorical models for women\u2019s rights\narguments\u201d (Botting and Kronewitter 2012). For example, Eileen\nBotting and Sean Kronewitter argue that The Subjection of\nWomen contains several examples of primitivist and Orientalist\nrhetorical moves, such as associating \u201cthe barbarism of\npatriarchal marriage with Eastern cultures and religions\u201d (2012,\n471). They also object that Mill offers instrumental arguments for\nwomen\u2019s rights, such as favoring the reduction of men\u2019s\nselfishness and the increase in men\u2019s intellectual stimulation\nin marriage, as well as doubling mental resources for the higher\nservice of humanity (2012, 470), suggesting that women\u2019s\nliberation is secondary to greater purposes.\n2.4.3 Moral contractarianism\n\nSome feminist ethicists argue for forms of contractarian ethics, that\nis, the view \u201cthat moral norms derive their normative force from\nthe idea of contract or mutual agreement\u201d (Cudd and Eftekhari\n2018). Contractarian ethics permit moral agents to critically assess\nthe value of any relationship, especially family relationships that\nmay be oppressive on gendered dimensions (Okin 1989; Hampton 1993;\nSample 2002; Radzik 2005). Other feminist contractarians appreciate\nHobbes\u2019s social contract theory for its applicability to women\nin positions of vulnerability. For example, Jean Hampton endorses\nHobbes\u2019s view that \u201cyou are under no obligation to make\nyourself prey to others\u201d (Hampton 1998, 236). Hampton combines\ninsights of both Kant and Hobbes in her version of feminist\ncontractarianism, \u201cbuilding in the Kantian assumption that all\npersons have intrinsic value and thus must have their interests\nrespected\u201d (Superson 2012; see also Richardson 2007).\nContractarianism arguably corrects gross injustices and inequities\ntraceable to gendered oppressions and the most serious evils that are\nsocially constructed (Anderson 1999; Hartley and Watson 2010).\n\nSome feminists argue for the usefulness of contractarian ethics to\nevaluate one\u2019s adaptive preferences, that is, \u201cpreferences\nformed in unconscious response to oppression\u201d (Walsh 2015, 829).\nFor example, Mary Barbara Walsh argues that social contract theory\nmodels \u201cthe conditions of autonomous choice, independence and\ndialogical reflection,\u201d and therefore \u201cexposes preferences\nthat fail to meet\u201d the conditions of autonomy. Feminist\ncontractarianism may thereby generate new understandings of social\ncontracts grounded in appreciation of material conditions,\ncommitments, and consent (Stark 2007; Welch 2012). Feminist\ncontractarians whose moral theories are influenced by John\nRawls\u2019s political philosophy suggest that his methodology, which\ninvolves reasoning from behind a veil of ignorance to decide which\nrules persons are rational to agree to, promotes critical appraisal of\npreferences that one would not hold in a better world (Richardson\n2007, 414).\n\nFeminist critics of contractarianism also raise concerns about\nadaptive preferences. In the actual, nonideal conditions in which\nindividuals and groups develop, dominant perspectives and oppressive\nsocial arrangements can make persons come to prefer things that they\nwould not otherwise prefer, such that the resultant preferences, when\nsatisfied, are not for the agent\u2019s own good, and may even\ncontribute to her group\u2019s oppression (Superson 2012). Feminists\nwho are concerned that not all moral agents can meaningfully consent\nto contracts point to examples of women who are denied access to the\npublic sphere, the market, education, and information (Held 1987;\nPateman 1988). Others point out that traditionally, social contract\ntheory has not attended to the inclusion of the needs of children,\ndisabled community members, or their caregivers (Held 1987; Kittay\n1999; Edenberg and Friedman 2013). Feminist critics of\ncontractarianism tend to argue both for full consideration of needs\nborn of differences between bodies and social locations, and against\ndescribing gender, embodiment, or dependency as a mere secondary\ncharacteristic irrelevant to what a body in need of care requires to\nflourish and thus what a \u201creasonable man\u201d would choose\nbehind a veil of ignorance (Nussbaum 2006; Pateman and Mills\n2007).\n2.4.4 Virtue ethics\n\nSome feminist ethicists contend that virtue ethics, which focuses on\nliving a good life or flourishing, offers the best approach to\nensuring that ethical theory correctly represents the conditions\npermitting vulnerable bodies to flourish in oppressive contexts.\nAlthough virtue ethics is most notably associated with Aristotle,\nwhose idealized and masculine agent is not generally considered\nparadigmatically feminist (Berges 2015, 3\u20134), feminists and\ntheir forerunners have engaged critically for several centuries with\nquestions about which virtues and qualities of character would promote\na good life in the context of what we now describe as women\u2019s\nsubordination. Philosophers who argue for feminist ethical virtues\nraise concerns that sexist oppression presents challenges to the\nexercise of virtues on the part of women and gender non-conforming\npeople. Robin Dillon observes that feminist virtue ethics\n\u201cidentifies problems for character in contexts of domination and\nsubordination and proposes ways of addressing those problems, and it\nidentifies problems of unreflective theory and proposes\npower-conscious alternatives\u201d (2017a, 381). Because the history\nof traditional virtue ethics is freighted with past characterizations\nof virtues as either gendered or as universal but less accessible to\nwomen, Dillon proposes what she calls \u201cfeminist critical\ncharacter ethics\u201d as an alternative to feminist virtue ethics\n(2017a, 380). Advocates of feminist virtue ethics and critical\ncharacter ethics consider the relationships of gender to accounts of\ncharacter, virtues, vices, and good lives (Baier 1994; Card 1996;\nCuomo 1998; Calhoun 1999; Dillon 2017a; Snow 2002; Tessman 2005; Green\nand Mews 2011; Berges 2015; Broad 2015; Harvey 2018).\n\nLike the ethic of care, virtue ethics is often described as offering a\ntheory that is not beholden to abstract and universal principles\n(Groenhout 2014), but instead acknowledges \u201cthat moral reasoning\nmight be an extraordinarily complex phenomenon \u2026, a view on\nwhich what the ethical life requires of us cannot be codified or\nreduced to a single principle or set of principles\u201d (Moody-Adams\n1991, 209\u2013210). A further commonality between care and virtue\nthat is of interest to feminists is that \u201cvirtue theory, like\ncare ethics, rejects a simplistic dichotomy between reason and\nemotion, and does not begin from the assumption that all human beings\nare essentially equal\u201d (Groenhout 2014, 487). Ethical theories\nof virtue or character tend to appreciate the importance of emotions\nand interpersonal relationships to a person\u2019s moral development.\nSome virtue ethics also focus on what opportunities for virtue are\navailable to agents in particular social contexts, which is useful in\nfeminist ethics when it comes to delineating our responsibilities as\nrelational beings and as characters who may exhibit vices resulting\nfrom oppression (Bartky 1990; Potter 2001; Bell 2009; Tessman 2009a;\nSlote 2011; Boryczka 2012).\n\nIndeed, the ethic of care bears so many important similarities to\nvirtue ethics that some authors have argued that a feminist ethic of\ncare just is a form or a subset of virtue ethics (Groenhout 1998;\nSlote 1998; McLaren 2001; Halwani 2003). Others believe that at a\nminimum, care and virtue ethics should inform each other and are\ncompatible with each other (Benner 1997; Sander-Staudt 2006). Here,\ntoo, however, feminist ethicists disagree. Some contend that lumping\ntogether care and virtue might render the complexity of moral\nexperiences and available moral responses less understandable rather\nthan more articulate (Groenhout 2014). Others suggest that this\nconsolidation might overlook important theoretical distinctions,\nincluding the capacity for virtue ethics to be gender-neutral while\nthe ethic of care maintains a commitment to embodied, particular, and\ngendered experiences (Sander-Staudt 2006).\n\nVirtue ethics provides wider opportunities for feminist ethics to\nattend to virtues such as integrity and courage in oppressive contexts\nthat the ethic of care tends not to prioritize (Davion 1993;\nSander-Staudt 2006). Resistance itself may be a \u201cburdened\nvirtue,\u201d which is Lisa Tessman\u2019s term for virtues that\nallow moral agents, even ones damaged by oppression, to endure and\nresist oppression, permitting a form of nobility that falls short of\neudaimonia (Tessman 2005). Tessman argues that when agents\nlive under conditions of systemic injustice, their opportunities to\nflourish are blocked and their pursuits may even be hopeless. She\nsuggests that \u201cthe burdened virtues include all those traits\nthat make a contribution to human flourishing\u2014if they succeed in\ndoing so at all\u2014only because they enable survival of or\nresistance to oppression \u2026, while in other ways they detract\nfrom their bearer's well-being, in some cases so deeply that their\nbearer may be said to lead a wretched life\u201d (Tessman 2005, 95).\nFeminist ethicists have explored virtues that permit the sort of\n\u201cconditioned flourishing\u201d that Tessman describes (2009,\n14), extending discussion of the virtues to specific applications in\nnonideal circumstances in which vulnerability is fundamental to the\nnature of a moral agent (Nussbaum 1986; Card 1996; Walker 2003). For\nexample, feminists have argued for distinctive virtues in contexts\nsuch as whistleblowing and organizational resistance (DesAutels 2009),\nhealthcare (Tong 1998), and ecological activism (Cuomo 1998).\n\nFeminist criticisms of the limits of virtue ethics point to its\nemphasis on the personal as potentially problematic when it comes to\n\u201caccounting for the possibility of social criticism and\nresistance on the part of the self who is constituted by the very\nsocial relationships and cultural traditions that would be the target\nof her resistance\u201d (Friedman 1993). Virtue ethics may also\ninclude intrusive requirements to self-evaluate one\u2019s every\nfeeling or practice to an extent that an ethic of duty, for example,\nwould not require (Conly 2001). Some care ethicists, most notably Nel\nNoddings (1984), argue that virtue ethics can be overly self-regarding\nrather than attentive to the point of view of another, and that it\nlocates moral motivation in rational, abstract, and idealized\nconceptions of the good life rather than in the natural well-spring of\nmoral motivation that is generated by encounters with particular\npersons.\n",
