    "main_text": "\n\nFatalism is the thesis that human acts occur by necessity and hence\nare unfree. Theological fatalism is the thesis that infallible\nforeknowledge of a human act makes the act necessary and hence unfree.\nIf there is a being who knows the entire future infallibly, then no\nhuman act is free.\n\nFatalism seems to be entailed by infallible foreknowledge by the\nfollowing informal line of reasoning:\n\nFor any future act you will perform, if some being infallibly believed\nin the past that the act would occur, there is nothing you can do now\nabout the fact that he believed what he believed since nobody has any\ncontrol over past events; nor can you make him mistaken in his belief,\ngiven that he is infallible. Therefore, there is nothing you can do\nnow about the fact that he believed in a way that cannot be mistaken\nthat you would do what you will do. But if so, you cannot do otherwise\nthan what he believed you would do. And if you cannot do otherwise,\nyou will not perform the act freely.\n\nThe same argument can be applied to any infallibly foreknown act of\nany human being. If there is a being who infallibly knows everything\nthat will happen in the future, no human being has any control over\nthe future.\n\nThis theological fatalist argument creates a dilemma for anyone who\nthinks it important to maintain both (1) there is a deity who\ninfallibly knows the entire future, and (2) human beings have free\nwill in the strong sense usually called libertarian. But it has also\nfascinated many who have not shared either of these commitments,\nbecause taking the argument\u2019s full measure requires rethinking\nsome of the most fundamental questions in philosophy, especially ones\nconcerning time, truth, and modality. Those philosophers who think\nthere is a way to consistently maintain both (1) and (2) are called\ncompatibilists about infallible foreknowledge and human free will.\nCompatibilists must either identify a false premise in the argument\nfor theological fatalism or show that the conclusion does not follow\nfrom the premises. Incompatibilists accept the incompatibility of\ninfallible foreknowledge and human free will and deny either\ninfallible foreknowledge or free will in the sense targeted by the\nargument.\n",
