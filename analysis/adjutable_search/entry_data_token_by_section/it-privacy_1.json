    "main_text": "Conceptions of privacy and the value of privacy || Constitutional vs. informational privacy\n1.1 Constitutional vs. informational privacy\n\nInspired by subsequent developments in U.S. law, a distinction can be\nmade between (1) constitutional (or decisional)\nprivacy and (2) tort (or informational)\nprivacy (DeCew 1997). The first refers to the freedom to make\none\u2019s own decisions without interference by others in regard to\nmatters seen as intimate and personal, such as the decision to use\ncontraceptives or to have an abortion. The second is concerned with\nthe interest of individuals in exercising control over access to\ninformation about themselves and is most often referred to as\n\u201cinformational privacy\u201d. Think here, for instance, about\ninformation disclosed on Facebook or other social media. All too\neasily, such information might be beyond the control of the\nindividual.\n\nStatements about privacy can be either descriptive or normative,\ndepending on whether they are used to describe the way people define\nsituations and conditions of privacy and the way they value them, or\nare used to indicate that there ought to be constraints on the use of\ninformation or information processing. These conditions or constraints\ntypically involve personal information regarding individuals, or ways\nof information processing that may affect individuals. Informational\nprivacy in a normative sense refers typically to a non-absolute moral\nright of persons to have direct or indirect control over access to (1)\ninformation about oneself, (2) situations in which others could\nacquire information about oneself, and (3) technology that can be used\nto generate, process or disseminate information about oneself.\n",
