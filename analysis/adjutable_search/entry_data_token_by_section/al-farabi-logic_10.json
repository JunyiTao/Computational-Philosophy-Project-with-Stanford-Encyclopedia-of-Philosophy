    "main_text": "Tools for Inference || Modal Logic\n6.3 Modal Logic\n\nThere is almost no mention of modal syllogisms in any of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s surviving works. He must have\ndiscussed modal syllogisms in his [Commentary on Prior\nAnalytics]; but the relevant part of this work is lost and we\nhave to rely on citations by Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides. These\ncitations between them tell us of only one modal syllogistic mood that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b either accepted or\n rejected.[17]\n\nFrom [Commentary on De Interpretatione] 193.3\u201319 and\nquotations in Maimonides, we know that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nclaimed, against Galen, that logic with possibility statements is\nuseful in practical arts where actual outcomes have to be predicted,\nsuch as medicine, agriculture, and navigation (Schacht & Meyerhof\n1937: 67). This looks at first sight like a confusion between\npossibility and probability. But more likely al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nbelieved that the laws of modal logic could be tweaked so as to work\nwith \u201cProbably\u201d in place of a modal operator. In fact\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does say at [Demonstration]\n44.20\u201322 that in many of the arts, \u201cNecessarily every\nA is a B\u201d and \u201cMost As are\nBs\u201d are treated as equivalent. (But wouldn\u2019t this\ncorrelate \u201cProbably\u201d with \u201cNecessarily\u201d rather\nthan \u201cPossibly\u201d? Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is not here to\nanswer the question.)\n\nThere is further evidence of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b experimenting\nwith other sentence forms in modal logic. Both Avicenna (Street 2001)\nand Averroes (Ibn Rushd, Maq\u0101l\u0101t 102.13f) cite\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b as considering syllogistic premises\ncontaining \u201cinsofar as\u201d, for example, \u201cEvery\nA can be a B insofar as it is a B\u201d. \n\nFrom Averroes (Ibn Rushd, Maq\u0101l\u0101t 129.11\u201317)\nwe also know that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b observed that to get the\nsyllogism\n\n\nEvery C is a possible B. Every B is a possible\nA.\n\nTherefore every C is a possible A.\n\n\n(a form that Aristotle accepted as perfect) we need that \u201cEvery\nB\u201d in the second premise means \u201cEvery possible\nB\u201d; otherwise the Cs might be possible Bs\nbut not actual Bs, so that they would escape the quantifier of\nthe second premise, and hence violate the dictum de omni.\nFrom this al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b inferred that at least in this\nmodal syllogism, Aristotle intended \u2018Every B\u2019 to be read as\n\u2018Every possible B\u2019.\n\nExactly what al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b meant by the dictum de\nomni is hard to make out from Averroes\u2019 account. But\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s use of it seems to contain an attempt\nto give a set-theoretic justification of\n Barbara[18]\n in modal contexts. Another quotation from Averroes (Ibn Rushd,\nMaq\u0101l\u0101t 154.18f) shows al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nusing the dictum de omni (again presumably a set-theoretic\nargument) to justify a syllogism where the major premise has a\nnegative subject:\n\n\nA sculpture is not an animal. What is not an animal is not a\nhuman.\n\nTherefore a sculpture is not a human.\n\n\nThis is\n Celarent[19]\n but with the middle term made negative.\n",
