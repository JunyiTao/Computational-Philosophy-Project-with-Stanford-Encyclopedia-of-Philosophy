    "main_text": "Interactivity || Interactivity and Creativity\n4.3 Interactivity and Creativity\n\nJust as the case of digital art can enrich our understanding of\ninteractivity, so it can enrich our understanding of artistic\ncreativity and creative attribution. This is in part because the\nissues of interactivity and creativity are closely related. In making\na work that is strongly interactive, an artist cedes to the user a\ncertain amount of control in determining the look, sound, or structure\nof the work\u2019s display(s). This raises a question about the\nuser\u2019s opportunities to be creative \u2014 to engage in\ncreative interactions with a work \u2014 and how these opportunities\ncan be supported or constrained by the artist\u2019s design. In order\nto answer this question, we need to unpack the notion of creative\ncontrol. In addition, we need to consider how creativity can be\nattributed to multiple agents involved at different stages of a\nwork\u2019s production. As it turns out, the case of AI art is\nparticularly useful when considering the conditions of creativity and\ncreative collaboration.\n\nThere is already a robust debate about the nature of creativity as it\noccurs in many different areas of human activity (see, e.g., Gaut\n& Kieran, eds., 2018; Paul & Kaufman, eds., 2014) There is a\ncase to be made, however, that this debate can be enriched by drawing\non work in the philosophy of AI. In everyday life, sophisticated AI\nsystems are now being used for all kinds of purposes: We rely on these\nsystems when we use Internet search engines, play strategic\nvideogames, accept purchasing recommendations from online retailers,\nand check for viruses on our computers. In addition, we can use AI to\ngenerate new images and text, some of which can be incorporated into\nworks of art. One can type a series of prompts into a chatbot like\nChatGPT in order to generate a new screenplay in a certain genre.\nSimilarly, one can assemble a set of images on which to train an\n\u201cartbot\u201d like MidJourney in order to generate paintings,\ndrawings, or what look like photographs. It is common to attribute\ncreative agency to the person who purposively initiates, and then\nmonitors, the program used to generate the images or text that make up\na work of AI art. A question remains, however, as to whether this\nshould be the sole creative attribution when AI is involved.\nSome artists describe the AI system with which they work as a creative\n\u201cpartner\u201d, and not just a sophisticated artistic tool.\nThis is particularly the case with recent artworks that rely on\n\u201cDeep Learning\u201d (DL) to generate images or text in a\nremarkably independent way. Both chatbots and artbots rely on deep\nlearning to categorize huge datasets (images or text) according to\npreviously undetected patterns. To do this, a DL system must give\nitself new instructions \u2014 ones that depart from the initial\ninstructions of the program \u2014 for the kind of image or text\nsegment, and for the particular image or text segment, to be\nproduced.\n\nAmong AI artists, the ones who write their own DL programs are the\nmost likely to describe AI as a creative partner rather than just a\ncreative tool. This seems particularly fitting when there is a\nsynchronous collaboration between the artist and their DL system. For\nexample, the works of Sougwen Chun are the result of Chun drawing\nalongside and in response to the actions of a mechanical drawing arm\nthat is controlled by Chun\u2019s custom-made program, D.O.U.G. (short\nfor \u201cDrawing Operations Unity Generation X\u201d).\nChun and D.O.U.G. take turns adding to a single drawing. During this\nprocess, it is harder than one might think to say what makes the\ndifference such that Chun is a creative agent, engaged in a creative\ndrawing process, and D.O.U.G. is not. This is the case even though it\nis Chun alone who comes up with the idea for the work and initiates\nthe drawing program.\n\nAs Margaret Boden has argued (2014), when philosophers deny the\npossibility of a computer ever being creative, they tend to\nunderestimate the capacities of computers to produce items that are\ngenuinely new as well as valuable in some domain. Still, many\ncreativity theorists argue that novelty and value are insufficient for\ncreativity; a third condition is needed, one concerning the manner of\nproduction. In order for something novel and valuable to count as\ncreative, it must have been produced in a way that is agent-driven.\nThe agency condition can be filled out, or broken down, in a variety\nof ways. At its core, however, the notion of agency is generally\nassumed to be opposed to the notion of having been\n\u2018programmed\u2019, or simply instructed, to perform certain\ntasks in a \u201cmechanical\u201d, or blind, fashion. Thus, the most\nbasic objection to the possibility of creative computers is that they\ncan only do what they are programmed to do, according to the\nintentions of a human agent. This objection needs clarification,\nhowever, since no set of rules completely determines the actions\ninvolved in following that set of rules. Since the advent of DL and\nother kinds of generative algorithm, it is possible for a computer\nprogram to change itself, to detect independent phenomena other than\nthe ones that it was designed to detect, and to mimic spontaneity\nthrough randomness. Is this an instance of creative rule-following? If\nit is, we might expand our notion of creative collaboration. Perhaps\ncreative collaboration is found, not just between human beings, but\nalso between human beings and machines. In so far as the machines in\nquestion support strong interactivity, a work of digital art might\ninvolve three-part collaborations between human artists, human users,\nand AI.\n",
