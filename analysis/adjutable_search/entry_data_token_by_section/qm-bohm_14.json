    "main_text": "Identical Particles\n15. Identical Particles \n\nFundamental particles of the same kind, for example electrons, are\ntreated in quantum mechanics as if they are somehow identical or\nindistinguishable. This treatment is reflected in the symmetry\nproperties of the wave function of a many-particle system under\npermutations of the coordinates of those particles. For electrons, and\nfor other fermions, the wave function must change its sign\nwhen the coordinates of a pair of particles are exchanged; it must\nbe antisymmetric. For photons and other bosons it\nmust be symmetric, with no change at all.\n\nThe justification usually given for this is that the only way to keep\ntrack of the individual particles and thereby retain their\nindividuality is by following their trajectories, which of course one\ncannot and must not do, and in any case does not have, in standard\nquantum mechanics. (Like so many arguments used to justify various\nclaims in quantum mechanics, this sort of argument, with its\npositivistic slant, is rather weak. Its conclusion, however, is quite\nsolid.) On this basis one often hears it maintained that Bohmian\nmechanics, because its particles have trajectories (deterministic ones\nto boot), is unable to deal with identical particles.\n\nThere is, however, no problem whatsoever in incorporating bosons and\nfermions into Bohmian mechanics. One simply stipulates that the wave\nfunction in Bohmian mechanics has the same symmetry properties under\npermutations as in standard quantum mechanics. Once again, in Bohmian\nmechanics one does not change the wave function or its evolution\nequation; one merely adds to it the actual configuration of the\nparticles and its guiding equation.\n\nIn fact, by taking the configuration seriously in Bohmian mechanics,\none perhaps arrives even more naturally than in standard quantum\nmechanics at the classification of fundamental quantum particles as\nbosons and fermions, with wave functions of the appropriate\nsymmetries. That\u2019s because the natural configuration space for a\nsystem of \\(N\\) particles, say electrons, described by the same\ndynamical parameters such as charge, consists of \\(N\\)-point subsets\nof physical space, and not \\(N\\)-tuples of points in physical\nspace. It is natural, in other words, to regard the labelling we\nassign to particles as an unphysical convenience, and to use on the\nfundamental level unlabelled configurations rather than labelled\nones. Wave functions on this natural configuration space are in effect\nsymmetric, trivially so.\n\nMoreover the natural configuration space has a non-trivial\ntopology. When this is taken into account the possibility of\nantisymmetric wave functions, of fermions, naturally\nemerges. (D\u00fcrr et al. 2006, following Nelson 1985 for stochastic\nmechanics. For a similar early analysis that is more traditionally\nquantum, see Leinaas and Myrheim 1977.)\n",
