An egalitarian distribution in which everyone has\nthe same bundle is trivially envy-free, but is generally\nPareto-inefficient, which means that there exist other feasible\nallocations that are better for some individuals and worse for none. A\ncompetitive equilibrium with equal shares (i.e., equal budgets) is the\ncentral example of a Pareto-efficient and envy-free allocation. It is\nenvy-free since all agents have the same budget options, so that\neveryone could buy everyone\u2019s bundle. It is Pareto-efficient\nbecause, by an important theorem of welfare economics, any perfectly\ncompetitive equilibrium is Pareto-efficient (in absence of asymmetric\ninformation, externalities, public goods). A non-technical\npresentation of this theorem can be found in Hausman and McPherson\n(2006, 5.2).\n\nThis concept of equity does not need any other information than\nindividual ordinal preferences. It is not welfarist, in the sense that\nfrom utility data alone it is impossible to distinguish an envy-free\nallocation from an allocation with envy. Moreover, an envy-free\nallocation may be Pareto-indifferent (everyone is indifferent) to\nanother allocation that has envy. On the other hand, this concept is\nstrongly egalitarian, and it is quite natural to view it as capturing\nthe idea of equality of resources (Dworkin 2000). When resources are\nmulti-dimensional, for instance when there are several consumption\ngoods, and when individual preferences are heterogeneous, it is not\nobvious to define equality of resources, but the no-envy criterion\nseems the best concept for this purpose. It guarantees that no\nindividual will consider that another has a better bundle than his. It\nhas been shown by Varian (1976) that, if preferences are sufficiently\ndiverse and numerous (a continuum), then the competitive equilibrium\nwith equal shares is the only Pareto-efficient and envy-free\nallocation.\n\nThis concept can also be related to the idea of equality of\nopportunities (Kolm 1996). An allocation is envy-free if and only if\nthe bundles granted to everyone could have been chosen by each\nindividual in the same opportunity set, such as, for instance, the set\ncontaining all the bundles of the allocation under consideration.\nAlong this vein, the concept of no-envy can also be shown to have a\nclose connection with incentive considerations. A no-envy test is used\nin the theory of optimal taxation in order to make sure that no one\nwould have interest to lie about one\u2019s preferences (Boadway and\nKeen 2000). Consider the condition that, when an allocation is\nselected and some individuals\u2019 preferences change so that their\nbundle goes up in their own preference ranking, then the selected\nallocation is still acceptable. A particular version of this condition\nplays a central role in the theory of incentives, under the name of\nMaskin monotonicity (see e.g. Jackson 2001), but it can also be given\nan ethical meaning, in terms of neutrality with respect to changes in\npreferences. Notice that envy-free allocations satisfy this condition,\nsince after such a change of preferences every individual\u2019s\nbundle goes up in his ranking, thereby precluding any appearance of\nenvy. Conversely, it turns out that this condition implies that the\nselected allocation must be envy-free, under the additional assumption\nthat, in any selected allocation, individuals with identical\npreferences must have equivalent bundles. If one also requires the\nselection to be Pareto-efficient, then one obtains a characterization\nof the competitive equilibrium with equal shares (Gevers 1986).\n",
