The Bible\n\nFor medieval Christians the Bible was what we call the Vulgate, a\nLatin translation of the Old Testament (as Christians called the\nJewish scriptures) and the New\n Testament.[4]\n The Protestant reformers have persuaded many that the Bible was\nneglected during the middle ages\u2014according to Luther the Bible\n\u201chas come to lie forgotten in the dust under the bench\u201d\n(see Luther [1539] 1915: vol. 1, 7; cf.\n 2 Kings 22:8).\n However, the many copies of the Bible made during the middle ages,\nthe many commentaries on books of the Bible made by medieval scholars\nand the constant references to the Bible in their writings show that\nthe Bible was a very familiar book.\n",
