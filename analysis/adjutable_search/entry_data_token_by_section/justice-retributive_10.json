    "main_text": "Range of Meanings and Uses || Lex talionis: Payback as response in kind\n3.6 Lex talionis: Payback as response in kind\n\nLex talionis is Latin for the law of retaliation. It connects\nto the original retributive notion of paying back a debt, and it\nspecifies that the debt is to be paid back in kind. It is reflected in\nthe Biblical injunction (which some Biblical scholars warn should be\ntaken symbolically, not literally) to take \u201can eye for an eye, a\ntooth for a tooth\u201d (Exodus 21: 23\u201325;\nLeviticus 24:17\u201320). Kant also endorses, in a somewhat\ndifferent way, this notion of punishment. Invoking the principle of\nequality for punishment, Kant writes: \n\n\nwhatever undeserved evil you inflict upon another within the people,\nthat you inflict upon yourself. (1797 [1991: 141]) \n\n\nThus, he who steals \n\n\ndeprives himself (by the principle of retribution) of security in any\nproperty\u2026. [and if] he has committed murder he must die. (1797\n[1991: 142])\n\n\nLex talionis provides a controversial principle of\nproportionality (for more on lex talionis as a measure of\nproportional punishment, see section 2 of the supplementary document\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality).\n But while retributive justice includes a commitment to punishment\nthat is proportional to the crime, it cannot be reduced to a measure\nof proportionality (Moore 1997: 88; Husak 2019).\n 3.7 Retrospective criminal justice\n\nIt is commonly said that the difference between consequentialist and\nretributive theories of punishment is that the former is prospective,\nlooking to the good that punishment may accomplish, while the latter\nis retrospective, seeking to do justice for what a wrongdoer has done.\nThat is a difference between the two, but retributivism\nshould not be reduced to the claim that it is punishment in response\nto a past crime. Other theories may refer to the fact that wrongdoers\nhave already done something in virtue of which it is proper to punish\nthem without thereby being retributivist. See, e.g., Quinn 1985 (it is\nrational to threaten people with punishment for crimes, and that\nrationality is transmitted to punishment if they commit crimes);\nTadros 2011 (criminals have a duty to endure punishment to make up for\nthe harm they have caused).\n",
