In its narrowest sense, \u201cvalue\ntheory\u201d is used for a relatively narrow area of normative\nethical theory particularly, but not exclusively, of concern to\nconsequentialists. In this narrow sense, \u201cvalue theory\u201d is\nroughly synonymous with \u201caxiology\u201d.

    "main_text": "\n1. Basic Questions\n\nThe theory of value begins with a subject matter. It is hard to\nspecify in some general way exactly what counts, but it certainly\nincludes what we are talking about when we say any of the following\nsorts of things (compare Ziff [1960]):\n\n\u201cpleasure is good/bad\u201d; \u201cit would be good/bad if you\ndid that\u201d; \u201cit is good/bad for him to talk to her\u201d;\n\u201ctoo much cholesterol is good/bad for your health\u201d;\n\u201cthat is a good/bad knife\u201d; \u201cJack is a good/bad\nthief\u201d; \u201che\u2019s a good/bad man\u201d;\n\u201cit\u2019s good/bad that you came\u201d; \u201cit would be\nbetter/worse if you didn\u2019t\u201d; \u201clettuce is\nbetter/worse for you than Oreos\u201d; \u201cmy new can opener is\nbetter/worse than my old one\u201d; \u201cMack is a better/worse\nthief than Jack\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s better/worse for it to end\nnow, than for us to get caught later\u201d; \u201cbest/worst of all,\nwould be if they won the World Series and kept all of their\nplayers for next year\u201d; \u201ccelery is the best/worst thing\nfor your health\u201d; \u201cMack is the best/worst thief\naround\u201d\n\n\nThe word \u201cvalue\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere on this\nlist; it is full, however, of \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cbetter\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d, and correspondingly of\n\u201cbad\u201d, \u201cworse\u201d, and \u201cworst\u201d. And\nthese words are used in a number of different kinds of constructions,\nof which we may take these four to be the main exemplars:\n\nPleasure is good.\nIt is good that you came.\nIt is good for him to talk to her.\nThat is a good knife.\n\n\nSentences like 1, in which \u201cgood\u201d is predicated of a mass\nterm, constitute a central part of traditional axiology, in which\nphilosophers have wanted to know what things (of which there can be\nmore or less) are good. I\u2019ll stipulatively call them value\nclaims, and use the word \u201cstuff\u201d for the kind of thing of\nwhich they predicate value (like pleasure, knowledge, and money).\nSentences like 2 make claims about what I\u2019ll (again\nstipulatively) call goodness simpliciter; this is the kind of\ngoodness appealed to by traditional utilitarianism. Sentences like 3\nare good for sentences, and when the subject following\n\u201cfor\u201d is a person, we usually take them to be claims about\nwelfare or well-being. And sentences like 4 are what, following Geach\n[1956], I\u2019ll call attributive uses of \u201cgood\u201d,\nbecause \u201cgood\u201d functions as a predicate modifier, rather\nthan as a predicate in its own right.\n\nMany of the basic issues in the theory of value begin with questions\nor assumptions about how these various kinds of claim are related to\none another. Some of these are introduced in the next two sections,\nfocusing in 1.1 on the relationship between our four kinds of\nsentences, and focusing in 1.2 on the relationship between\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d, and between\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d.\n1.1 Varieties of Goodness\n\nClaims about good simpliciter are those which have garnered the\nmost attention in moral philosophy. This is partly because as it is\nusually understood, these are the \u201cgood\u201d claims that\nconsequentialists hold to have a bearing on what we ought to do.\nConsequentialism, so understood, is the view that you ought to do\nwhatever action is such that it would be best if you did it. This\nleaves, however, a wide variety of possible theories about how such\nclaims are related to other kinds of \u201cgood\u201d claim.\n1.1.1 Good Simpliciter and Good For\n\nFor example, consider a simple point of view theory, according\nto which what is good simpliciter differs from what is good for\nJack, in that being good for Jack is being good from a certain point\nof view \u2014 Jack\u2019s \u2014 whereas being good\nsimpliciter is being good from a more general point of view\n\u2014 the point of view of the universe (compare Nagel [1985]). The\npoint of view theory reduces both good for and good\nsimpliciter to good from the point of view of, and\nunderstands good simpliciter claims as about the point of view\nof the universe. One problem for this view is to make sense of what\nsort of thing points of view could be, such that Jack and the universe\nare both the kinds of thing to have one.\n\nAccording to a different sort of theory, the agglomerative\ntheory, goodness simpliciter is just what you get by\n\u201cadding up\u201d what is good for all of the various people\nthat there are. Rawls [1971] attributes this view to utilitarians, and\nit fits with utilitarian discussions such as that of Smart\u2019s\ncontribution to Smart and Williams [1973], but much more work would\nhave to be done in order to make it precise. We sometimes say things\nlike, \u201cwearing that outfit in the sun all day is not going to be\ngood for your tan line\u201d, but your tan line is not one of the\nthings whose good it seems plausible to \u201cadd up\u201d in order\nto get what is good simpliciter. Certainly it is not one of the\nthings whose good classical utilitarians would want to add up. So the\nfact that sapient and even sentient beings are not the only kinds of\nthing that things can be good or bad for sets an important constraint\nboth on accounts of the good for relation, and on theories\nabout how it is related to good simpliciter.\n\nRather than accounting for either of goodness simpliciter or\ngoodness-for in terms of the other, some philosophers have\ntaken one of these seriously at the expense of the other. For example,\nPhilippa Foot [1985] gives an important but compressed argument that\napparent talk about what is good simpliciter can be made\nsense of as elliptical talk about what is good for some unmentioned\nperson, and Foot\u2019s view can be strengthened (compare Shanklin\n[2011], Finlay [2014]) by allowing that apparent good\nsimpliciter claims are often generically quantified\nstatements about what is, in general, good for a person. Thomson\n[2008] famously defends a similar view.\n\nG.E. Moore [1903], in contrast, struggled to make sense of good-for\nclaims. In his refutation of egoism, Moore attributed to ethical\negoists the theory that what is good for Jack (or \u201cin\nJack\u2019s good\u201d) is just what is good and in Jack\u2019s\npossession, or alternatively, what it is good that Jack possesses.\nMoore didn\u2019t argue against these theses directly, but he did\nshow that they cannot be combined with universalizable egoism. It is\nnow generally recognized that to avoid Moore\u2019s arguments,\negoists need only to reject these analyses of good for, which\nare in any case unpromising (Smith [2003]).\n1.1.2 Attributive Good\n\nOther kinds of views understand good simpliciter in terms of\nattributive good. What, after all, are the kinds of things to which we\nattribute goodness simpliciter? According to many philosophers,\nit is to propositions, or states of affairs. This is supported by a\ncursory study of the examples we have considered, in which what is\nbeing said to be good appears to be picked out by complementizers like\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cthat\u201d, and \u201cfor\u201d: \u201cit\nwould be good if you did that\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s good that you\ncame\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s better for it to end now\u201d. If\ncomplementizer phrases denote propositions or possible states of\naffairs, then it is reasonable to conjecture, along with Foot [1985]\nthat being good simpliciter is being a good state of affairs,\nand hence that it is a special case of attributive good (if it makes\nsense at all \u2014 Geach and Foot both argue that it does not, on\nthe ground that states of affairs are too thin of a kind to support\nattributive good claims).\n\nSee the\n\nSupplement on Four Complications about Attributive Good\n\n\nfor further complications that arise when we consider the attributive\nsense of \u201cgood\u201d.\n\nSome philosophers have used the examples of attributive good and\ngood for in order to advance arguments against noncognitivist\nmetaethical theories (See the entry\n cognitivism and non-cognitivism).\n The basic outlines of such an argument go like this: noncognitivist\ntheories are designed to deal with good simpliciter, but have\nsome kind of difficulties accounting for attributive good or for\ngood for. Hence, there is a general problem with noncognitivist\ntheories, or at least a significant lacuna they leave. It has\nsimilarly been worried that noncognitivist theories will have problems\naccounting for so-called \u201cagent-relative\u201d value [see\nsection 4], again, apparently, because of its relational nature. There\nis no place to consider this claim here, but note that it would be\nsurprising if relational uses of \u201cgood\u201d like these were in\nfact a deep or special problem for noncognitivism; Hare\u2019s\naccount in The Language of Morals (Hare [1952]) was\nspecifically about attributive uses of \u201cgood\u201d, and it is\nnot clear why relational noncognitive attitudes should be harder to\nmake sense of than relational beliefs.\n1.1.3 Relational Strategies\n\nIn an extension of the strategies just discussed, some theorists have\nproposed views of \u201cgood\u201d which aspire to treat all of good\nsimpliciter, good for, and attributive good as special\ncases. A paradigm of this approach is the \u201cend-relational\u201d\ntheory of Paul Ziff [1960] and Stephen Finlay [2004], [2014].\nAccording to Ziff, all claims about goodness are relative to ends or\npurposes, and \u201cgood for\u201d and attributive\n\u201cgood\u201d sentences are simply different ways of making these\npurposes (more or less) explicit. Talk about what is good for Jack,\nfor example, makes the purpose of Jack\u2019s being happy (say)\nexplicit, while talk about what is a good knife makes our usual\npurposes for knives (cutting things, say) explicit. The claim about\ngoodness is then relativized accordingly.\n\nViews adopting this strategy need to develop in detail answers to just\nwhat, exactly, the further, relational, parameter on\n\u201cgood\u201d is. Some hold that it is ends, while others\nsay things like \u201caims\u201d. A filled-out version of this view\nmust also be able to tell us the mechanics of how these ends\ncan be made explicit in \u201cgood for\u201d and attributive\n\u201cgood\u201d claims, and needs to really make sense of both of\nthose kinds of claim as of one very general kind. And, of course, this\nsort of view yields the prediction that non-explicitly relativized\n\u201cgood\u201d sentences \u2014 including those used throughout\nmoral philosophy \u2014 are really only true or false once the end\nparameter is specified, perhaps by context.\n\nThis means that this view is open to the objection that it fails to\naccount for a central class of uses of \u201cgood\u201d in ethics,\nwhich by all evidence are non-relative, and for which the\nlinguistic data do not support the hypothesis that they are\ncontext-sensitive. J.L. Mackie held a view like this one and embraced\nthis result \u2014 Mackie\u2019s [1977] error theory about\n\u201cgood\u201d extended only to such putative non-relational\nsenses of \u201cgood\u201d. Though he grants that there are such\nuses of \u201cgood\u201d, Mackie concludes that they are mistaken.\nFinlay [2014], in contrast, argues that he can use ordinary pragmatic\neffects in order to explain the appearances. The apparently\nnon-relational senses of \u201cgood\u201d, Finlay argues, really are\nrelational, and his theory aspires to explain why they seem\notherwise.\n1.1.4 What\u2019s Special About Value Claims\n\nThe sentences I have called \u201cvalue claims\u201d present special\ncomplications. Unlike the other sorts of \u201cgood\u201d sentences,\nthey do not appear to admit, in a natural way, of comparisons.\nSuppose, for example, with G.E. Moore, that pleasure is good and\nknowledge is good. Which, we might ask, is better? This question does\nnot appear to make very much sense, until we fix on some amount\nof pleasure and some amount of knowledge. But if Sue is a good\ndancer and Huw is a good dancer, then it makes perfect sense to ask\nwho is the better dancer, and without needing to fix on any particular\namount of dancing \u2014 much less on any amount of Sue or\nHuw. In general, just as the kinds of thing that can be tall are the\nsame kinds of thing as can be taller than each other, the kinds of\nthing that can be good are the same kinds of thing as can be better\nthan one another. But the sentences that we are calling \u201cvalue\nclaims\u201d, which predicate \u201cgood\u201d of some stuff,\nappear not to be like this.\n\nOne possible response to this observation, if it is taken seriously,\nis to conclude that so-called \u201cvalue claims\u201d have a\ndifferent kind of logical form or structure. One way of implementing\nthis idea, the good-first theory, is to suppose that\n\u201cpleasure is good\u201d means something roughly like,\n\u201c(other things equal) it is better for there to be more\npleasure\u201d, rather than, \u201cpleasure is better than most\nthings (in some relevant comparison class)\u201d, on a model with\n\u201cSue is a good dancer\u201d, which means roughly, \u201cSue is\na better dancer than most (in some relevant comparison class)\u201d.\nAccording to a very different kind of theory, the value-first\ntheory, when we say that pleasure is good, we are saying that pleasure\nis a value, and things are better just in case there is more of the\nthings which are values. These two theories offer competing orders of\nexplanation for the same phenomenon. The good-first theory analyzes\nvalue claims in terms of \u201cgood\u201d simpliciter, while the\nvalue-first theory analyzes \u201cgood\u201d simpliciter in\nterms of value claims. The good-first theory corresponds to the thesis\nthat states of affairs are the \u201cprimary bearers\u201d of value;\nthe value-first theory corresponds to the alternative thesis that it\nis things like pleasure or goodness (or perhaps their instances) that\nare the \u201cprimary bearers\u201d of value.\n\nAccording to a more skeptical view, sentences like \u201cpleasure is\ngood\u201d do not express a distinctive kind of claim at all, but are\nmerely what you get when you take a sentence like \u201cpleasure is\ngood for Jill to experience\u201d, generically quantify out Jill, and\nellipse \u201cto experience\u201d. Following an idea also developed\nby Finlay [2014], Robert Shanklin [2011] argues that in general,\ngood-for sentences pattern with experiencer adjectives like\n\u201cfun\u201d, which admit of these very syntactic\ntransformations: witness \u201cJack is fun for Jill to talk\nto\u201d, \u201cJack is fun to talk to\u201d, \u201cJack is\nfun\u201d. This view debunks the issue over which the views discussed\nin the last paragraph disagree, for it denies that there is any such\ndistinct topic for value claims to be about. (It may also explain the\nfailures of comparative forms, above, on the basis of differences in\nthe elided material.)\n1.2 Good, Better, Bad\n1.2.1 Good and Better\n\nOn a natural view, the relationship between \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cbetter\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d would seem to be the same\nas that between \u201ctall\u201d, \u201ctaller\u201d, and\n\u201ctallest\u201d. \u201cTall\u201d is a gradable adjective, and\n\u201ctaller\u201d is its comparative form. On standard views,\ngradable adjectives are analyzed in terms of their comparative form.\nAt bottom is the relation of being taller than, and someone is\nthe tallest woman\u00a0just in case she is taller than every woman.\nSimilarly, someone is tall, just in case she is taller than a\ncontextually appropriate standard (Kennedy [2005]), or taller than\nsufficiently many (this many be vague) in some contextually\nappropriate comparison class.\n\nMuch moral philosophy appears to assume that things are very different\nfor \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cbetter\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d.\nInstead of treating \u201cbetter than\u201d as basic, and something\nas being good just in case it is better than sufficiently many in some\ncomparison class, philosophers very often assume, or write as if they\nassume, that \u201cgood\u201d is basic. For example, many theorists\nhave proposed analyses of what it is to be good\u00a0which are\nincompatible with the claim that \u201cgood\u201d is to be\nunderstood in terms of \u201cbetter\u201d. In the absence of some\nreason to think that \u201cgood\u201d is very different from\n\u201ctall\u201d, however, this may be a very peculiar kind of claim\nto make, and it may distort some other issues in the theory of\nvalue.\n1.2.2 Value\n\nMoreover, it is difficult to see how one could do things the other way\naround, and understand \u201cbetter\u201d in terms of\n\u201cgood\u201d. Jon is a better sprinter than Jan not because it\nis more the case that Jon is a good sprinter than that Jan is a good\nsprinter \u2014 they are both excellent sprinters, so neither one of\nthese is more the case than the other. It is, however, possible to see\nhow to understand both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d in\nterms of value. If good is to better as tall is to taller, then the\nanalogue of value should intuitively be height. One person is taller\nthan another just in case her height is greater; similarly, one state\nof affairs is better than another just in case its value is greater.\nIf we postulate something called \u201cvalue\u201d to play this\nrole, then it is natural (though not obligatory) to identify value\nwith amounts of values \u2014 amounts of things like pleasure\nor knowledge, which \u201cvalue\u201d claims claim to be good.\n\nBut this move appears to be implausible or unnecessary when applied to\nattributive \u201cgood\u201d. It is not particularly plausible that\nthere is such a thing as can-opener value, such that one can-opener is\nbetter than another just in case it has more can-opener value. In\ngeneral, not all comparatives need be analyzable in terms of something\nlike height, of which there can be literally more or less. Take, for\nexample, the case of \u201cscary\u201d. The analogy with height\nwould yield the prediction that if one horror film is scarier than\nanother, it is because it has more of something \u2014 scariness\n\u2014 than the other. This may be right, but it is not obviously so.\nIf it is not, then the analogy need not hold for \u201cgood\u201d\nand its cognates, either. In this case, it may be that being better\nthan does not merely amount to having more value than.\n1.2.3 Good and Bad\n\nThese questions, moreover, are related to others. For example,\n\u201cbetter\u201d would appear to be the inverse relation of\n\u201cworse\u201d. A is better than B just in case B is worse than\nA. So if \u201cgood\u201d is just \u201cbetter than sufficiently\nmany\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d is just \u201cworse than\nsufficiently many\u201d, all of the interesting facts in the\nneighborhood would seem to be captured by an assessment of what stands\nin the better than relation to what. The same point goes if to\nbe good is just to be better than a contextually set standard. But it\nhas been held by many moral philosophers that an inventory of what is\nbetter than what would still leave something interesting and important\nout: what is good.\n\nIf this is right, then it is one important motivation for denying that\n\u201cgood\u201d can be understood in terms of \u201cbetter\u201d.\nBut it is important to be careful about this kind of argument.\nSuppose, for example, that, as is commonly held about\n\u201ctall\u201d, the relevant comparison class or standard for\n\u201cgood\u201d is somehow supplied by the context of utterance.\nThen to know whether \u201cthat is good\u201d is true, you do\nneed to know more than all of the facts about what is better than what\n\u2014 you also need to know something about the comparison class or\nstandard that is supplied by the context of utterance. The assumption\nthat \u201cgood\u201d is context-dependent in this way may therefore\nitself be just the kind of thing to explain the intuition which drives\nthe preceding argument.\n2. Traditional Questions\n\nTraditional axiology seeks to investigate what things are good, how\ngood they are, and how their goodness is related to one another.\nWhatever we take the \u201cprimary bearers\u201d of value to be, one\nof the central questions of traditional axiology is that of what\nstuffs are good: what is of value.\n2.1 Intrinsic Value\n2.1.1 What is Intrinsic Value?\n\nOf course, the central question philosophers have been interested in,\nis that of what is of intrinsic value, which is taken to\ncontrast with instrumental value. Paradigmatically, money is\nsupposed to be good, but not intrinsically good: it is supposed to be\ngood because it leads to other good things: HD TV\u2019s and houses\nin desirable school districts and vanilla lattes, for example. These\nthings, in turn, may only be good for what they lead to: exciting NFL\nSundays and adequate educations and caffeine highs, for example. And\nthose things, in turn, may be good only for what they lead to, but\neventually, it is argued, something must be good, and not just for\nwhat it leads to. Such things are said to be intrinsically\ngood.\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 adoption of the term \u201cintrinsic\u201d for\nthis distinction reflects a common theory, according to which whatever\nis non-instrumentally good must be good in virtue of its intrinsic\nproperties. This idea is supported by a natural argument: if something\nis good only because it is related to something else, the argument\ngoes, then it must be its relation to the other thing that is\nnon-instrumentally good, and the thing itself is good only because it\nis needed in order to obtain this relation. The premise in this\nargument is highly controversial (Schroeder [2005]), and in fact many\nphilosophers believe that something can be non-instrumentally good in\nvirtue of its relation to something else. Consequently, sometimes the\nterm \u201cintrinsic\u201d is reserved for what is good in virtue of\nits intrinsic properties, or for the view that goodness itself\nis an intrinsic property, and non-instrumental value is instead called\n\u201ctelic\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d (Korsgaard [1983]).\nI\u2019ll stick to \u201cintrinsic\u201d, but keep in mind that\nintrinsic goodness may not be an intrinsic property, and that what is\nintrinsically good may turn out not to be so in virtue of its\nintrinsic properties.\n\nSee the\n\nSupplement on Atomism/Holism about Value\n\n\nfor further discussion of the implications of the assumption that\nintrinsic value supervenes on intrinsic properties.\n\nInstrumental value is also sometimes contrasted with\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d value. The idea behind this distinction is\nthat instrumental values lead causally to intrinsic values,\nwhile constitutive values amount to intrinsic values. For\nexample, my giving you money, or a latte, may causally result in your\nexperiencing pleasure, whereas your experiencing pleasure may\nconstitute, without causing, your being happy. For many\npurposes this distinction is not very important and often not noted,\nand constitutive values can be thought, along with instrumental\nvalues, as things that are ways of getting something of intrinsic\nvalue. I\u2019ll use \u201cinstrumental\u201d in a broad sense, to\ninclude such values.\n2.1.2 What is the Intrinsic/Instrumental Distinction Among?\n\nI have assumed, here, that the intrinsic/instrumental distinction is\namong what I have been calling \u201cvalue claims\u201d, such as\n\u201cpleasure is good\u201d, rather than among one of the other\nkinds of uses of \u201cgood\u201d from part 1. It does not make\nsense, for example, to say that something is a good can opener, but\nonly instrumentally, or that Sue is a good dancer, but only\ninstrumentally. Perhaps it does make sense to say that vitamins are\ngood for Jack, but only instrumentally; if that is right, then the\ninstrumental/intrinsic distinction will be more general, and it may\ntell us something about the structure of and relationship between the\ndifferent senses of \u201cgood\u201d, to look at which uses of\n\u201cgood\u201d allow an intrinsic/instrumental distinction.\n\nIt is sometimes said that consequentialists, since they appeal to\nclaims about what is good simpliciter in their explanatory\ntheories, are committed to holding that states of affairs are the\n\u201cprimary\u201d bearers of value, and hence are the only things\nof intrinsic value. This is not right. First, consequentialists can\nappeal in their explanatory moral theory to facts about what state of\naffairs would be best, without holding that states of affairs are the\n\u201cprimary\u201d bearers of value; instead of having a\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theory, they may have a\n\u201cvalue-first\u201d theory (see section 1.1.4), according to\nwhich states of affairs are good or bad in virtue of there\nbeing more things of value in them. Moreover, even those who take a\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theory are not really committed to holding\nthat it is states of affairs that are intrinsically valuable; states\nof affairs are not, after all, something that you can collect more or\nless of. So they are not really in parallel to pleasure or\nknowledge.\n\nFor more discussion of intrinsic value, see the entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic value.\n2.2 Monism/Pluralism\n\nOne of the oldest questions in the theory of value is that of whether\nthere is more than one fundamental (intrinsic) value. Monists say\n\u201cno\u201d, and pluralists say \u201cyes\u201d. This question\nonly makes sense as a question about intrinsic values; clearly there\nis more than one instrumental value, and monists and pluralists will\ndisagree, in many cases, not over whether something is of value, but\nover whether its value is intrinsic. For example, as important\nas he held the value of knowledge to be, Mill was committed to holding\nthat its value is instrumental, not intrinsic. G.E. Moore disagreed,\nholding that knowledge is indeed a value, but an intrinsic one, and\nthis expanded Moore\u2019s list of basic values. Mill\u2019s theory\nfamously has a pluralistic element as well, in contrast with\nBentham\u2019s, but whether Mill properly counts as a pluralist about\nvalue depends on whether his view was that there is only one value\n\u2014 happiness \u2014 but two different kinds of pleasure which\ncontribute to it, one more effectively than the other, or whether his\nview was that each kind of pleasure is a distinctive value. This point\nwill be important in what follows.\n2.2.1 Ontology and Explanation\n\nAt least three quite different sorts of issues are at stake in this\ndebate. First is an ontological/explanatory issue. Some monists have\nheld that a plural list of values would be explanatorily\nunsatisfactory. If pleasure and knowledge are both values, they have\nheld, there remains a further question to be asked: why? If this\nquestion has an answer, some have thought, it must be because there is\na further, more basic, value under which the explanation subsumes both\npleasure and knowledge. Hence, pluralist theories are either\nexplanatorily inadequate, or have not really located the basic\nintrinsic values.\n\nThis argument relies on a highly controversial principle about how an\nexplanation of why something is a value must work \u2014 a very\nsimilar principle to that which was appealed to in the argument that\nintrinsic value must be an intrinsic property [section 2.1.1]. If this\nprinciple is false, then an explanatory theory of why both\npleasure and knowledge are values can be offered which does not work\nby subsuming them under a further, more fundamental value. Reductive\ntheories of what it is to be a value satisfy this description,\nand other kinds of theory may do so, as well (Schroeder [2005]). If\none of these kinds of theory is correct, then even pluralists can\noffer an explanation of why the basic values that they appeal to are\nvalues.\n2.2.2 Revisionary Commitments?\n\nMoreover, against the monist, the pluralist can argue that the basic\nposits to which her theory appeals are not different in kind\nfrom those to which the monist appeals; they are only different in\nnumber. This leads to the second major issue that is at stake\nin the debate between monists and pluralists. Monistic theories carry\nstrong implications about what is of value. Given any monistic theory,\neverything that is of value must be either the one intrinsic value, or\nelse must lead to the one intrinsic value. This means that if some\nthings that are intuitively of value, such as knowledge, do not, in\nfact, always lead to what a theory holds to be the one intrinsic value\n(for example, pleasure), then the theory is committed to denying that\nthese things are really always of value after all.\n\nConfronted with these kinds of difficulties in subsuming everything\nthat is pre-theoretically of value under one master value, pluralists\ndon\u2019t fret: they simply add to their list of basic intrinsic\nvalues, and hence can be more confident in preserving the\npre-theoretical phenomena. Monists, in contrast, have a choice. They\ncan change their mind about the basic intrinsic value and try all over\nagain, they can work on developing resourceful arguments that\nknowledge really does lead to pleasure, or they can bite the bullet\nand conclude that knowledge is really not, after all, always good, but\nonly under certain specific conditions. If the explanatory commitments\nof the pluralist are not different in kind from those of the\nmonist, but only different in number, then it is natural for\nthe pluralist to think that this kind of slavish adherence to the\nnumber one is a kind of fetish it is better to do without, if we want\nto develop a theory that gets things right. This is a\nperspective that many historical pluralists have shared.\n2.2.3 Incommensurability\n\nThe third important issue in the debate between monists and\npluralists, and the most central over recent decades, is that over the\nrelationship between pluralism and incommensurability. If one state of\naffairs is better than another just in case it contains more value\nthan the other, and there are two or more basic intrinsic values, then\nit is not clear how two states of affairs can be compared, if one\ncontains more of the first value, but the other contains more of the\nsecond. Which state of affairs is better, under such a circumstance?\nIn contrast, if there is only one intrinsic value, then this\ncan\u2019t happen: the state of affairs that is better is the one\nthat has more of the basic intrinsic value, whatever that is.\n\nReasoning like this has led some philosophers to believe that\npluralism is the key to explaining the complexity of real moral\nsituations and the genuine tradeoffs that they involve. If some things\nreally are incomparable or incommensurable, they reason, then\npluralism about value could explain why. Very similar reasoning\nhas led other philosophers, however, to the view that monism\nhas to be right: practical wisdom requires being able to make\nchoices, even in complicated situations, they argue. But that would be\nimpossible, if the options available in some choice were incomparable\nin this way. So if pluralism leads to this kind of incomparability,\nthen pluralism must be false.\n\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll consider the debate over the\ncomparability of values on which this question hinges. But even if we\ngrant all of the assumptions on both sides so far, monists have the\nbetter of these two arguments. Value pluralism may be one way\nto obtain incomparable options, but there could be other ways, even\nconsistently with value monism. For example, take the interpretation\nof Mill on which he believes that there is only one intrinsic value\n\u2014 happiness \u2014 but that happiness is a complicated sort of\nthing, which can happen in each of two different ways \u2014 either\nthrough higher pleasures, or through lower pleasures. If Mill has this\nview, and holds, further, that it is in some cases indeterminate\nwhether someone who has slightly more higher pleasures is happier than\nsomeone who has quite a few more lower pleasures, then he can explain\nwhy it is indeterminate whether it is better to be the first way or\nthe second way, without having to appeal to pluralism in his theory of\nvalue. The pluralism would be within his theory of\nhappiness alone.\n\nSee a more detailed discussion in the entry on\n value pluralism.\n2.3 Incommensurability/Incomparability\n\nWe have just seen that one of the issues at stake in the debate\nbetween monists and pluralists about value turns on the question\n(vaguely put) of whether values can be incomparable or\nincommensurable. This is consequently an area of active dispute in its\nown right. There are, in fact, many distinct issues in this debate,\nand sometimes several of them are run together.\n2.3.1 Is there Weak Incomparability?\n\nOne of the most important questions at stake is whether it must always\nbe true, for two states of affairs, that things would be better if the\nfirst obtained than if the second did, that things would be better if\nthe second obtained than if the first did, or that things would be\nequally good if either obtained. The claim that it can sometimes\nhappen that none of these is true is sometimes referred to as the\nclaim of incomparability, in this case as applied to good\nsimpliciter. Ruth Chang [2002] has argued that in addition to\n\u201cbetter than\u201d, \u201cworse than\u201d, and\n\u201cequally good\u201d, there is a fourth \u201cpositive value\nrelation\u201d, which she calls parity. Chang reserves the use\nof \u201cincomparable\u201d to apply more narrowly, to the\npossibility that in addition to none of the other three relations\nholding between them, it is possible that two states of affairs may\nfail even to be \u201con a par\u201d. However, we can distinguish\nbetween weak incomparability, defined as above, and\nstrong incomparability, further requiring the lack of parity,\nwhatever that turns out to be. Since the notion of parity is\nitself a theoretical idea about how to account for what happens when\nthe other three relations fail to obtain, a question which I\nwon\u2019t pursue here, it will be weak incomparability that will\ninterest us here.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the question of whether good\nsimpliciter admits of incomparability from the question of\nwhether good for and attributive good admit of incomparability.\nMany discussions of the incomparability of values proceed at a very\nabstract level, and interchange examples of each of these kinds of\nvalue claims. For example, a typical example of a purported\nincomparability might compare, say, Mozart to Rodin. Is Mozart a\nbetter artist than Rodin? Is Rodin a better artist than Mozart? Are\nthey equally good? If none of these is the case, then we have an\nexample of incomparability in attributive good, but not an example of\nincomparability in good simpliciter. These questions may be\nparallel or closely related, and investigation of each may be\ninstructive in consideration of the other, but they still need to be\nkept separate.\n\nFor example, one important argument against the incomparability of\nvalue was mentioned in the previous section. It is that\nincomparability would rule out the possibility of practical wisdom,\nbecause practical wisdom requires the ability to make correct choices\neven in complicated choice situations. Choices are presumably between\nactions, or between possible consequences of those actions. So it\ncould be that attributive good is sometimes incomparable, because\nneither Mozart nor Rodin is a better artist than the other and they\nare not equally good, but that good simpliciter is always\ncomparable, so that there is always an answer as to which of two\nactions would lead to an outcome that is better.\n2.3.2 What Happens when there is Weak Incomparability?\n\nEven once it is agreed that good simpliciter is incomparable in\nthis sense, many theories have been offered as to what that\nincomparability involves and why it exists. One important constraint\non such theories is that they not predict more incomparabilities than\nwe really observe. For example, though Rodin may not be a better or\nworse artist than Mozart, nor equally good, he is certainly a better\nartist than Salieri \u2014 even though Salieri, like Mozart, is a\nbetter composer than Rodin. This is a problem for the idea that\nincomparability can be explained by value pluralism. The argument from\nvalue pluralism to incomparability suggested that it would be\nimpossible to compare any two states of affairs where one contained\nmore of one basic value and the other contained more of another. But\ncases like that of Rodin and Salieri show that the explanation of what\nis incomparable between Rodin and Mozart can\u2019t simply be that\nsince Rodin is a better sculptor and Mozart is a better composer,\nthere is no way of settling who is the better artist. If that were the\ncorrect explanation, then Rodin and Salieri would also be\nincomparable, but intuitively, they are not. Constraints like these\ncan narrow down the viable theories about what is going on in cases of\nincomparability, and are evidence that incomparability is probably not\ngoing to be straightforwardly explained by value pluralism.\n\nThere are many other kinds of theses that go under the title of the\nincomparability or incommensurability of values. For example, some\ntheories which posit lexical orderings are said to commit to\n\u201cincomparabilities\u201d. Kant\u2019s thesis that rational\nagents have a dignity and not a price is often taken to be a thesis\nabout a kind of incommensurability, as well. Some have interpreted\nKant to be holding simply that respect for rational agents is of\ninfinite value, or that it is to be lexically ordered over the value\nof anything else. Another thesis in the neighborhood, however, would\nbe somewhat weaker. It might be that a human life is \u201cabove\nprice\u201d in the sense that killing one to save one is not an\nacceptable exchange, but that for some positive value of \\(n\\),\nkilling one to save \\(n\\) would be an acceptable exchange. On this\nview, there is no single \u201cexchange value\u201d for a life,\nbecause the value of a human life depends on whether you are\n\u201cbuying\u201d or \u201cselling\u201d \u2014 it is higher\nwhen you are going to take it away, but lower when you are going to\npreserve it. Such a view would intelligibly count as a kind of\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d, because it sets no single value on\nhuman lives.\n\nA more detailed discussion of the commensurability of values can be\nfound in the entry on\n incommensurable values.\n3. Relation to the Deontic\n\nOne of the biggest and most important questions about value is the\nmatter of its relation to the deontic \u2014 to categories like\nright, reason, rational, just, and\nought. According to teleological views, of which\nclassical consequentialism and universalizable egoism are classic\nexamples, deontic categories are posterior to and to be explained in\nterms of evaluative categories like good and good for.\nThe contrasting view, according to which deontic categories are prior\nto, and explain, the evaluative categories, is one which, as Aristotle\nsays, has no name. But its most important genus is that of\n\u201cfitting attitude\u201d accounts, and Scanlon\u2019s [1998]\n\u201cbuck-passing\u201d theory is another closely related\ncontemporary example.\n3.1 Teleology\n\nTeleological theories are not, strictly speaking, theories about\nvalue. They are theories about right action, or about what one ought\nto do. But they are committed to claims about value, because\nthey appeal to evaluative facts, in order to explain what is right and\nwrong, and what we ought to do \u2014 deontic facts. The most\nobvious consequence of these theories, is therefore that evaluative\nfacts must not then be explained in terms of deontic facts. The\nevaluative, on such views, is prior to the deontic.\n3.1.1 Classical Consequentialism\n\nThe most familiar sort of view falling under this umbrella is\nclassical consequentialism, sometimes called (for reasons\nwe\u2019ll see in section 3.3) \u201cagent-neutral\nconsequentialism\u201d. According to classical consequentialism,\nevery agent ought always to do whatever action, out of all of the\nactions available to her at that time, is the one such that if she did\nit, things would be best. Not all defenders of consequentialism\ninterpret it in such classical terms; other prominent forms of\nconsequentialism focus on rules or motives, and evaluate actions only\nderivatively.\n\nClassical consequentialism is sometimes supported by appeal to the\nintuition that one should always do the best action, and then the\nassumption that actions are only instrumentally good or bad \u2014\nfor the sake of what they lead to (compare especially Moore [1903]).\nThe problem with this reasoning is that non-consequentialists can\nagree that agents ought always to do the best action. The important\nfeature of this claim to recognize is that it is a claim not about\nintrinsic or instrumental value, but about attributive good. And as\nnoted in section 2.1, \u201cinstrumental\u201d and\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d don\u2019t really apply to attributive good.\nJust as how good of a can opener something is or how good of a\ntorturer someone is does not depend on how good the world is, as a\nresult of the fact that they exist, how good of an action something is\nneed not depend on how good the world is, as a result that it happens.\nIndeed, if it did, then the evaluative standards governing actions\nwould be quite different from those governing nearly everything\nelse.\n3.1.2 Problems in Principle vs. Problems of Implementation\n\nClassical consequentialism, and its instantiation in the form of\nutilitarianism, has been well-explored, and its advantages and costs\ncannot be surveyed here. Many of the issues for classical\nconsequentialism, however, are issues for details of its exact\nformulation or implementation, and not problems in principle\nwith its appeal to the evaluative in order to explain the deontic. For\nexample, the worry that consequentialism is too demanding has been\naddressed within the consequentialist framework, by replacing\n\u201cbest\u201d with \u201cgood enough\u201d \u2014 substituting\na \u201csatisficing\u201d conception for a \u201cmaximizing\u201d\none (Slote [1989]). For another example, problems faced by certain\nconsequentialist theories, like traditional utilitarianism, about\naccounting for things like justice can be solved by other\nconsequentialist theories, simply by adopting a more generous picture\nabout what sort of things contribute to how good things are (Sen\n[1982]).\n\nIn section 3.3 we\u2019ll address one of the most central issues\nabout classical consequentialism: its inability to allow for\nagent-centered constraints. This issue does pose an\nin-principle general problem for the aspiration of consequentialism to\nexplain deontic categories in terms of the evaluative. For more, see\nthe entry on\n consequentialism and utilitarianism.\n3.1.3 Other Teleological Theories\n\nUniversalizable egoism is another familiar teleological theory.\nAccording to universalizable egoism, each agent ought always to do\nwhatever action has the feature that, of all available alternatives,\nit is the one such that, were she to do it, things would be best\nfor her. Rather than asking agents to maximize the good, egoism\nasks agents to maximize what is good for them. Universalizable\negoism shares many features with classical consequentialism, and\nSidgwick found both deeply attractive. Many others have joined\nSidgwick in holding that there is something deeply attractive about\nwhat consequentialism and egoism have in common \u2014 which\ninvolves, at minimum, the teleological idea that the deontic is to be\nexplained in terms of the evaluative (Portmore [2005]).\n\nOf course, not all teleological theories share the broad features of\nconsequentialism and egoism. Classical Natural Law theories (Finnis\n[1980], Murphy [2001]) are teleological, in the sense that they seek\nto explain what we ought to do in terms of what is good, but they do\nso in a very different way from consequentialism and egoism. According\nto an example of such a Natural Law theory, there are a variety of\nnatural values, each of which calls for a certain kind of distinctive\nresponse or respect, and agents ought always to act in ways that\nrespond to the values with that kind of respect. For more on natural\nlaw theories, see the entry on\n the natural law tradition in ethics.\u00a0\n And Barbara Hermann has prominently argued for interpreting\nKant\u2019s ethical theory in teleological terms.\u00a0 For more on\nHerman\u2019s interpretation of Kant, see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy,\n especially section 13.\u00a0Philip Pettit [1997] prominently\ndistinguishes between values that we are called to\n\u201cpromote\u201d and those which call for other responses.\u00a0\nAs Pettit notes, classical consequentialists hold that all values are\nto be promoted, and one way of thinking of some of these other kinds\nof teleological theories is that like consequentialism they explain\nwhat we ought to do in terms of what is good, but unlike\nconsequentialism they hold that some kinds of good call for responses\nother than promotion.\n3.2 Fitting Attitudes\n\nIn contrast to teleological theories, which seek to account for\ndeontic categories in terms of evaluative ones, Fitting Attitudes\naccounts aspire to account for evaluative categories \u2014 like good\nsimpliciter, good for, and attributive good \u2014 in\nterms of the deontic. Whereas teleology has implications about\nvalue but is not itself a theory primarily about value, but\nrather about what is right, Fitting Attitudes accounts are\nprimarily theses about value \u2014 in accounting for it in terms of\nthe deontic, they tell us what it is for something to be good. Hence,\nthey are theories about the nature of value.\n\nThe basic idea behind all kinds of Fitting Attitudes account is that\n\u201cgood\u201d is closely linked to \u201cdesirable\u201d.\n\u201cDesireable\u201d, of course, in contrast to\n\u201cvisible\u201d and \u201caudible\u201d, which mean\n\u201cable to be seen\u201d and \u201cable to be heard\u201d, does\nnot mean \u201cable to be desired\u201d. It means, rather, something\nlike \u201ccorrectly desired\u201d or \u201cappropriately\ndesired\u201d. If being good just is being desirable, and being\ndesirable just is being correctly or appropriately desired, it follows\nthat being good just is being correctly or appropriately desired. But\ncorrect and appropriate are deontic concepts, so if\nbeing good is just being desirable, then goodness can itself be\naccounted for in terms of the deontic. And that is the basic idea\nbehind Fitting Attitudes accounts (Ewing [1947], Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f6nnow-Rasmussen [2004]).\n3.2.1 Two Fitting Attitudes Accounts\n\nDifferent Fitting Attitudes accounts, however, work by appealing to\ndifferent deontic concepts. Some of the problems facing Fitting\nAttitudes views can be exhibited by considering a couple exemplars.\nAccording to a formula from Sidgwick, for example, the good is what\nought to be desired. But this slogan is not by itself very helpful\nuntil we know more: desired by whom? By everyone? By at least someone?\nBy someone in particular? And for which of our senses of\n\u201cgood\u201d does this seek to provide an account? Is it an\naccount of good simpliciter, saying that it would be good if\n\\(p\\) just in case ____ ought to desire that \\(p\\), where\n\u201c____\u201d is filled in by whoever it is, who is supposed to\nhave the desire? Or is it an account of \u201cvalue\u201d claims,\nsaying that pleasure is good just in case pleasure ought to be desired\nby ____?\n\nThe former of these two accounts would fit in with the\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theory from section 1.1.4; the latter would\nfit in with the \u201cvalue-first\u201d theory. We observed in\nsection 1.1.4 that \u201cvalue\u201d claims don\u2019t admit of\ncomparatives in the same way that other uses of \u201cgood\u201d do;\nthis is important here because if \u201cbetter\u201d simpliciter is\nprior to \u201cgood\u201d simpliciter, then strictly speaking a\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theorist needs to offer a Fitting Attitudes\naccount of \u201cbetter\u201d, rather than of \u201cgood\u201d.\nSuch a modification of the Sidgwickian slogan might say that it would\nbe better if \\(p\\) than if \\(q\\) just in case ____ ought to desire\nthat \\(p\\) more than that \\(q\\) (or alternatively, to prefer \\(p\\) to\n\\(q\\)).\n\nIn What We Owe to Each Other, T.M. Scanlon offered an\ninfluential contemporary view with much in common with Fitting\nAttitudes accounts, which he called the Buck-Passing theory of\nvalue. According to Scanlon\u2019s slogan, \u201cto call something\nvaluable is to say that it has other properties that provide reasons\nfor behaving in certain ways with respect to it.\u201d One important\ndifference from Sidgwick\u2019s view is that it appeals to a\ndifferent deontic concept: reasons instead of ought. But\nit also aspires to be more neutral than Sidgwick\u2019s slogan on the\nspecific response that is called for. Sidgwick\u2019s slogan required\nthat it is desire that is always relevant, whereas\nScanlon\u2019s slogan leaves open that there may be different\n\u201ccertain ways\u201d of responding to different kinds of\nvalues.\n\nBut despite these differences, the Scanlonian slogan shares with the\nSidgwickian slogan the feature of being massively underspecified. For\nwhich sense of \u201cgood\u201d does it aspire to provide an\naccount? Is it really supposed to be directly an account of\n\u201cgood\u201d, or, if we respect the priority of\n\u201cbetter\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d, should we really try to\nunderstand it as, at bottom, an account of \u201cbetter than\u201d?\nAnd crucially, which are the \u201ccertain ways\u201d that are\ninvolved? It can\u2019t just be that the speaker has to have some\ncertain ways in mind, because there are some ways of responding such\nthat reasons to respond in that way are evidence that the thing in\nquestion is bad rather than that it is good \u2014 for\nexample, the attitude of dread. So does the theory require that\nthere is some particular set of certain ways, such that a thing is\ngood just in case there are reasons to respond to it in any of\nthose ways? Scanlon\u2019s initial remarks suggest rather that\nfor each sort of thing, there are different \u201ccertain ways\u201d\nsuch that when we say that that thing is good, we are saying\nthat there are reasons to respond to it in those ways. This is a\nmatter that would need to be sorted out by any worked out view.\n\nA further complication with the Scanlonian formula, is that appealing\nin the analysis to the bare existential claim that there are\nreasons to respond to something in one of these \u201ccertain\nways\u201d faces large difficulties. Suppose, for example, that there\nis some reason to respond in one of the \u201ccertain ways\u201d,\nbut there are competing, and weightier, reasons not to, so that all\nthings considered, responding in any of the \u201ccertain ways\u201d\nwould be a mistake. Plausibly, the thing under consideration should\nnot turn out to be good in such a case. So even a view like\nScanlon\u2019s, which appeals to reasons, may need, once it is more\nfully developed, to appeal to specific claims about the weight\nof those reasons.\n3.2.2 The Wrong Kind of Reason\n\nEven once these kinds of questions are sorted out, however, other\nsignificant questions remain. For example, one of the famous problems\nfacing such views is the Wrong Kind of Reasons problem (Crisp\n[2000], Rabinowicz and R\u00f6nnow-Rasmussen [2004]). The problem\narises from the observation that intuitively, some factors can affect\nwhat you ought to desire without affecting what is good. It may be\ntrue that if we make something better, then other things being equal,\nyou ought to desire it more. But we can also create incentives\nfor you to desire it, without making it any better. For example, you\nmight be offered a substantial financial reward for desiring something\nbad, or an evil demon might (credibly) threaten to kill your family\nunless you do so. If these kinds of circumstances can affect what you\nought to desire, as is at least intuitively plausible, then they will\nbe counterexamples to views based on the Sidgwickian formula.\nSimilarly, if these kinds of circumstances can give you reasons\nto desire the thing which is bad, then they will be counterexamples to\nviews based on the Scanlonian formula. It is in the context of the\nScanlonian formula that this issue has been called the \u201cWrong\nKind of Reasons\u201d problem, because if these circumstances do give\nyou reasons to desire the thing that is bad, they are reasons of the\nwrong kind to figure in a Scanlon-style account of what it is to be\ngood.\n\nThis issue has recently been the topic of much fruitful investigation,\nand investigators have drawn parallels between the kinds of reason to\ndesire that are provided by these kinds of \u201cexternal\u201d\nincentives and familiar issues about pragmatic reasons for belief and\nthe kind of reason to intend that exists in Gregory Kavka\u2019s\nToxin Puzzle (Hieronymi [2005]). Focusing on the cases of desire,\nbelief, and intention, which are all kinds of mental state, some have\nclaimed that the distinction between the \u201cright kind\u201d and\n\u201cwrong kind\u201d of reason can be drawn on the basis of the\ndistinction between \u201cobject-given\u201d reasons, which refer to\nthe object of the attitude, and \u201cstate-given\u201d reasons,\nwhich refer to the mental state itself, rather than to its object\n(Parfit [2001], Piller [2006]). But questions have also been raised\nabout whether the \u201cobject-given\u201d/\u201cstate-given\u201d\ndistinction is general enough to really explain the distinction\nbetween reasons of the right kind and reasons of the wrong kind, and\nit has even been disputed whether the distinction tracks anything at\nall.\n\nOne reason to think that the distinction may not be general enough, is\nthat situations very much like Wrong Kind of Reasons situations can\narise even where no mental states are in play. For example, games are\nsubject to norms of correctness. External incentives to cheat \u2014\nfor example, a credible threat from an evil demon that she will kill\nyour family unless you do so \u2014 can plausibly not only provide\nyou with reasons to cheat, but make it the case that you ought to. But\njust as such external incentives don\u2019t make it appropriate or\ncorrect to desire something bad, they don\u2019t make it a correct\nmove of the game to cheat (Schroeder [2010]). If this is right, and\nthe right kind/wrong kind distinction among reasons really does arise\nin a broad spectrum of cases, including ones like this one, it is not\nlikely that a distinction that only applies to reasons for mental\nstates is going to lie at the bottom of it.\n\nFurther discussion of fitting attitudes accounts of\nvalue and the wrong kind of reasons problem can be found in the entry\non\n fitting attitude theories of value.\n3.2.4 Application to the Varieties of Goodness\n\nOne significant attraction to Fitting Attitudes-style accounts, is\nthat they offer prospects of being successfully applied to attributive\ngood and good for, as well as to good simpliciter\n(Darwall [2002], R\u00f6nnow-Rasmussen [2009], Suikkanen [2009]). Just\nas reasons to prefer one state of affairs to another can underwrite\none state of affairs being better than another, reasons to choose one\ncan-opener over another can underwrite its being a better can opener\nthan the other, and reasons to prefer some state of affairs for\nsomeone\u2019s sake can underwrite its being better for that\nperson than another. For example, here is a quick sketch of what an\naccount might look like, which accepts the good-first theory from\nsection 1.1.4, holds as in section 1.1.2 that good simpliciter\nis a special case of attributive good, and understands attributive\n\u201cgood\u201d in terms of attributive \u201cbetter\u201d and\n\u201cgood for\u201d in terms of \u201cbetter for\u201d:\n\n\nAttributive better: For all kinds K, and things\nA and B, for A to be a better K\nthan B is for the set of all of the right kind of reasons to\nchoose A over B when selecting a K to be\nweightier than the set of all of the right kind of reasons to choose\nB over A when selecting a K.\n\nBetter for: For all things A, B, and\nC, A is better for C than B is\njust in case the set of all of the right kind of reasons to choose\nA over B on C\u2019s behalf is weightier\nthan the set of all of the right kind of reasons to choose B\nover A on C\u2019s behalf.\n\n\nIf being a good K is just being a better K than most (in some\ncomparison class), and \u201cit would be good if \\(p\\)\u201d just\nmeans that \\(p\\)\u2018s obtaining is a good state of affairs, and\nvalue claims like \u201cpleasure is good\u201d just mean that other\nthings being equal, it is better for there to be more pleasure, then\nthis pair of accounts has the right structure to account for the full\nrange of \u201cgood\u201d claims that we have encountered. But it\nalso shows how the various senses of \u201cgood\u201d are related,\nand allows that even attributive good and good for have, at\nbottom, a common shared structure. So the prospect of being able to\noffer such a unified story about what the various senses of\n\u201cgood\u201d have in common, though not the exclusive property\nof the Fitting Attitudes approach, is nevertheless one of its\nattractions.\n3.3 Agent-Relative Value?\n3.3.1 Agent-Centered Constraints\n\nThe most central, in-principle problem for classical consequentialism\nis the possibility of what are called agent-centered\nconstraints (Scheffler [1983]). It has long been a traditional\nobjection to utilitarian theories that because they place no intrinsic\ndisvalue on wrong actions like murder, they yield the prediction that\nif you have a choice between murdering and allowing two people to die,\nit is clear that you should murder. After all, other things being\nequal, the situation is stacked 2-to-1 \u2014 there are two deaths on\none side, but only one death on the other, and each death is equally\nbad.\n\nConsequentialists who hold that killings of innocents are\nintrinsically bad can avoid this prediction. As long as a murder is at\nleast twice as bad as an ordinary death not by murder,\nconsequentialists can explain why you ought not to murder, even in\norder to prevent two deaths. So there is no in-principle problem for\nconsequentialism posed by this sort of example; whether it is an issue\nfor a given consequentialist depends on her axiology: on what she\nthinks is intrinsically bad, and how bad she thinks it is.\n\nBut the problem is very closely related to a genuine problem for\nconsequentialism. What if you could prevent two murders by murdering?\nPostulating an intrinsic disvalue to murders does nothing to account\nfor the intuition that you still ought not to murder, even in this\ncase. But most people find it pre-theoretically natural to assume that\neven if you should murder in order to prevent thousands of murders,\nyou shouldn\u2019t do it in order to prevent just two. The constraint\nagainst murdering, on this natural intuition, goes beyond the idea\nthat murders are bad. It requires that the badness of your own murders\naffects what you should do more than it affects what others should do\nin order to prevent you from murdering. That is why it is called\n\u201cagent-centered\u201d.\n3.3.2 Agent-Relative Value\n\nThe problem with agent-centered constraints is that there seems to be\nno single natural way of evaluating outcomes that yields all of the\nright predictions. For each agent, there is some way of evaluating\noutcomes that yields the right predictions about what she ought to do,\nbut these rankings treat that agent\u2019s murders as contributing\nmore to the badness of outcomes than other agents\u2019 murders. So\nas a result, an incompatible ranking of outcomes appears to be\nrequired in order to yield the right predictions about what some other\nagent ought to do \u2014 namely, one which rates his murders\nas contributing more to the badness of outcomes than the first\nagent\u2019s murders. (The situation is slightly more complicated\n\u2014 Oddie and Milne [1991] prove that under pretty minimal\nassumptions there is always some agent-neutral ranking that\nyields the right consequentialist predictions, but their proof does\nnot show that this ranking has any independent plausibility, and Nair\n[2014] argues that it cannot be an independently plausible account of\nwhat is a better outcome.)\n\nAs a result of this observation, philosophers have postulated a thing\ncalled agent-relative value. The idea of agent-relative value\nis that if the better than relation is relativized to\nagents, then outcomes in which Franz murders can be\nworse-relative-to Franz than outcomes in which Jens murders,\neven though outcomes in which Jens murders are worse-relative-to Jens\nthan outcomes in which Franz murders. These contrasting rankings of\nthese two kinds of outcomes are not incompatible, because each is\nrelativized to a different agent \u2014 the former to Franz, and the\nlatter to Jens.\n\nThe idea of agent-relative value is attractive to teleologists,\nbecause it allows a view that is very similar in structure to\nclassical consequentialism to account for constraints. According to\nthis view, sometimes called Agent-Relative Teleology or\nAgent-Centered Consequentialism, each agent ought always to do\nwhat will bring about the results that are best-relative-to her. Such\na view can easily accommodate an agent-centered constraint not to\nmurder, on the assumption that each agent\u2019s murders are\nsufficiently worse-relative-to her than other agent\u2019s murders\nare (Sen [1983], Portmore [2007]).\n\nSome philosophers have claimed that Agent-Relative Teleology is not\neven a distinct theory from classical consequentialism, holding that\nthe word \u201cgood\u201d in English picks out agent-relative value\nin a context-dependent way, so that when consequentialists say,\n\u201ceveryone ought to do what will have the best results\u201d,\nwhat they are really saying is that \u201ceveryone ought to do what\nwill have the best-relative-to-her results\u201d (Smith [2003]). And\nother philosophers have suggested that Agent-Relative Teleology is\nsuch an attractive theory that everyone is really committed to it\n(Dreier [1996]). These theses are bold claims in the theory of value,\nbecause they tell us strong and surprising things about the nature of\nwhat we are talking about, when we use the word,\n\u201cgood\u201d.\n3.3.3 Problems and Prospects\n\nIn fact, it is highly controversial whether there is even such a thing\nas agent-relative value in the first place. Agent-Relative\nTeleologists typically appeal to a distinction between agent-relative\nand agent-neutral value, but others have contested that no one has\never successfully made such a distinction in a theory-neutral way\n(Schroeder [2007]). Moreover, even if there is such a distinction,\nrelativizing \u201cgood\u201d to agents is not sufficient to deal\nwith all intuitive cases of constraints, because common sense allows\nthat you ought not to murder, even in order to prevent yourself\nfrom murdering twice in the future. In order to deal with such cases,\n\u201cgood\u201d will need to be relativized not just to agents, but\nto times (Brook [1991]). Yet a further source of difficulties\narises for views according to which \u201cgood\u201d in English is\nused to make claims about agent-relative value in a context-dependent\nway; such views fail ordinary tests for context-dependence, and\ndon\u2019t always generate the readings of sentences which their\nproponents require.\n\nOne of the motivations for thinking that there must be such a thing as\nagent-relative value comes from proponents of Fitting Attitudes\naccounts of value, and goes like this: if the good is what ought to be\ndesired, then there will be two kinds of good. What ought to be\ndesired by everyone will be the \u201cagent-neutral\u201d good, and\nwhat ought to be desired by some particular person will be the good\nrelative-to that person. Ancestors of this idea can be found in\nSidgwick and Ewing, and it has found a number of contemporary\nproponents. Whether it is right will turn not only on whether Fitting\nAttitudes accounts turn out to be correct, but on what role the answer\nto the questions, \u201cwho ought?\u201d or \u201cwhose\nreasons?\u201d plays in the shape of an adequate Fitting Attitudes\naccount. All of these issues remain unresolved.\n\nThe questions of whether there is such a thing as agent-relative\nvalue, and if so, what role it might play in an agent-centered variant\non classical consequentialism, are at the heart of the debate between\nconsequentialists and deontologists, and over the fundamental question\nof the relative priority of the evaluative versus the deontic. These\nare large and open questions, but as I hope I\u2019ve illustrated\nhere, they are intimately interconnected with a very wide range of\nboth traditional and non-traditional questions in the theory of value,\nbroadly construed.\n",
