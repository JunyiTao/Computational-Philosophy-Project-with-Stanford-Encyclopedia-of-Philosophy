Fuzzy logic and vagueness\n\nModeling reasoning with vague predicates and propositions is often\ncited as the main motivation for introducing fuzzy logics. There are\nmany alternative theories of\n vagueness,\n but there is a general agreement that the susceptibility to the\n sorites paradox\n is a main feature of vagueness. Consider the following version of the\nparadox:\n\n(1)\\(10^{100}\\)\nis a huge number.\n(2)If \\(n\\) is\na huge number, then \\(n-1\\) is also huge.\n\n\nOn the face of it, it seems not to be unreasonable to accept these two\nassumptions. By instantiating \\(n\\) with \\(10^{100}\\) in\n (2)\n and applying modus ponens with\n (1)\n as the other premise we conclude that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge. By\nsimply repeating this type of inference we arrive at the unreasonable\nstatement\n\n(3)\\(0\\) is a\nhuge number.\n\n\nFuzzy logic suggests an analysis of the sorites paradox that\nrespects the intuition that statement\n (2),\n while arguably not totally true, is almost true.\n\nThere are various ways to model this form of reasoning in t-norm-based\nfuzzy logics that dissolve the paradox. For example, one may declare\nthat any instance of modus ponens is sound if the degree of\ntruth of the conclusion is not lower than that of the strong\nconjunction of its premises.[5]\n As indicated, one stipulates that every instance of\n (2)\n is true to degree \\(1-\\epsilon\\), for some very small number\n\\(\\epsilon\\). Even if we declare\n (1)\n to be perfectly true, the statement that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge, too,\nmight then be less than perfectly true without sacrificing the\nsoundness of instantiation and modus ponens. If, moreover,\nthe degree of truth of the conjunction of two not perfectly true (and\nnot perfectly false) statements is less than that of each conjunct, we\nmay safely declare that statement\n (3)\n is perfectly false and nevertheless insist on the soundness of each\nstep in the indicated chain of inferences. Informally speaking, the\nparadox disappears by assuming that repeatedly decreasing some\nperfectly huge number by a small amount leads to numbers of which it\nis less and less true that they are huge too.\n\nAn alternative truth-degree-based solution to the sorites\nparadox has been proposed in H\u00e1jek & Nov\u00e1k\n2003. They introduce a new truth-functional connective modeling the\nexpression \u201cit is almost true that\u201d. In this manner they\nformalize sorites-style reasoning within an axiomatic theory\nof an appropriate t-norm-based fuzzy logic.\n\nNicholas J.J. Smith (2005 and 2008) has argued that the so-called\ncloseness principle captures the essence of vagueness. It\nexpresses that statements of the same form about indistinguishable\nobjects should remain close in respect of truth. It is a hallmark of\nmany approaches to the sorites paradox that employ fuzzy logic that\nthey are compatible with this\n principle.[6]\n\n",
