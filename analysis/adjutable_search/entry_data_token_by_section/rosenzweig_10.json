    "main_text": "The Star of Redemption || Overview\n3.1 Overview\n\n\nRosenzweig understands The Star of Redemption as his\ncontribution to the \u201cnew thinking,\u201d and the book does\npolemicize against those systems of German Idealism in which Rosenzweig\nfinds the \u201cold thinking\u201d to be most fully realized. But the\nStar\u2019s post-Kantian metaphysical aspirations, its\nsystematic structure, and its dramatic scope recommend its comparison\nto the great systems of Schelling and Hegel more than to any other\nphilosophical work. Indeed, Rosenzweig insists in numerous contexts\nthat the Star be understood \u201conly as a system of\nphilosophy,\u201d that is, as committed to the very task of systematic\nthinking to which the German Idealists were committed. This tension\nbetween the systematic goals of the Star and\nRosenzweig\u2019s explicit call for a \u201cnew thinking\u201d that\nwould turn away from the assumptions and tendencies of the\nphilosophical tradition culminating in German Idealism has been the\nsource of considerable puzzlement among readers of the Star\nfrom Rosenzweig\u2019s own time down to the present. One might suggest\nthat Rosenzweig shares with the German Idealists the conviction that\nthe fundamental questions human beings ask\u2014including those\nquestions about the relationship between the individual self and the\nwhole of the world which perplexed Rosenzweig during his own personal\nand intellectual development\u2014can only find their grounded\nanswers within the context of a philosophical system. At the same time,\nhowever, Rosenzweig insists that the perennial philosophical quest for\n\u201cknowledge of the All\u201d can only reach its goals if\nphilosophy takes into consideration the insights of the \u201cnew\nthinking\u201d regarding temporality, revelation, and the human\nbeing\u2019s fundamental individuality.\n\n\nThe Star is such a multi-faceted work, however, that\ngenerations of readers have discovered in it myriad philosophical\ninsights which far outspan its systematic aspirations. The book\u2019s\ninfluence on later Jewish thought and continental thought may well be\nsaid to rest far more heavily on the fruitfulness of some of those\nindividual insights in the book that appear to be decidedly\nanti-systematic, than on the book\u2019s own overall\ncommitment to systematicity. The book offers a rich account of the\ntemporal situatedness of the human being, and suggests that the\nactuality we experience can only be understood through the tenses of\npast, present, and future. It exemplifies the fusion of philosophy and\ntheology which the \u201cnew thinking\u201d is meant to realize; and\nits philosophical utilization of theological concepts like\n\u201ccreation,\u201d \u201crevelation,\u201d and\n\u201credemption,\u201d seeks both to aid philosophy in fulfilling\nits own 2500-year potential, and to answer those perennial questions of\nJewish and Christian theology that have perplexed religious thinkers\nthroughout the ages. The Star works out its own aesthetics and\nhistory of art. Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the Star\nis its formulation of a \u201cspeech-thinking,\u201d which presents\nlanguage as the \u201corganon\u201d through which the unifying\nrelations between beings occur and can be understood. At the center of\nthis speech-thinking is a philosophy of dialogue which traces the\nawakening of selfhood through an I-You relation into which the self is\ncalled by the Absolute other. The book introduces a form of dialectical\nlogic meant to rival Hegel\u2019s. It offers a series of\ninterpretations of Biblical texts meant to evoke the uniqueness of the\nBible as a written text which nevertheless makes it possible to hear\nthe divine word. The Star presents Judaism and Christianity as\ncommunal forms whose institutions and liturgical calendar enable human\nbeings to bring eternity into time. And the book includes within it a\nsweeping history of religion and philosophy, politics and culture, from\nancient times to the present. In short, much like the systems of German\nIdealism, the Star offers the reader numerous points of\naccess; but all these points of access are meant to hold together\nwithin a single overarching vision of truth and the path to it.\n\n\nRosenzweig understands the task of system to entail grasping and\narticulating \u201cthe All\u201d\u2014the whole of what is\u2014in\nits identity and difference, that is, as both a single unity and as\nthe most comprehensive diversity of particulars. While he sees the\nquest for knowledge of the All as rooted in the early questions of the\npre-Socratics, he identifies the German Idealists as those who\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d system as the explicit overarching task of\nphilosophy. Committed as Rosenzweig remains, in the Star, to\nthis systematic task, he breaks from German Idealism perhaps most\ndramatically in the standpoint out of which he insists systematic\nknowledge is to be attained. In the systems of German Idealism, the\nphilosopher seeks to attain the standpoint of the Absolute\u2014the\nvery Absolute out of which all particular beings are understood to\nhave unfolded dialectically. According to Rosenzweig, such Absolute\nIdealism fails to grasp particulars in their particularity, because it\nassumes the fundamental unity of all particulars within the Absolute\nfrom the start. In contrast, Rosenzweig seeks to grasp the\n\u201cAll\u201d, in the Star, not from an Absolute\nstandpoint, but rather from the standpoint of the finite individual\nhuman being whom he finds situated\nin the middle of the course of the All, a course Rosenzweig\nunderstands as beginning in particularity, and advancing through the\nrelations between particulars to an ultimate redemptive realization of\nunity. One may read the very first sentence of\nthe Star\u2014\u201cAll knowing of the All begins in death,\nthe fear of death\u201d\u2014as a programmatic announcement of\nRosenzweig\u2019s basic quarrel with German Idealism over the standpoint\nout of which systematic knowledge may be attained: an Absolute\nstandpoint that claims to overcome the limits of human finitude will\nnot yield true knowledge of the All. Only a proper recognition of the\nunique character of the individual mortal human being holds the\npromise for systematic knowledge.\n\n\nThe Star is a disorienting work in many ways. Keeping in mind\nthe overall structure of the book can do much to help keep the reader\nfrom getting lost while reading it. The Star is divided into\nthree parts, each of which is itself divided into three\n\u201cbooks\u201d and includes, as well, both an introductory\nchapter presenting the particular sort of shift in thinking Rosenzweig\nwants to achieve through the books of that part, and a transitional\nchapter that prepares the reader to move on to what comes next. The\nthree books of the first part of the Star present\nphilosophical constructions of what Rosenzweig asserts to be the three\nfundamental kinds of beings\u2014God, world, self\u2014as\nthe elements out of which the system will be realized. The\nthree books of the second part introduce the course along\nwhich God, world, and self enter into relations among themselves that\nadvance towards unity, relations Rosenzweig denotes through the\ntheological notions of creation, revelation, and redemption. The third\npart of the book inquires into the possibility of envisioning\nthat figure of the star, in its redemptive unity, whose\nconstruction out of the elements along their course the reader has\nfollowed in the first and second parts of the book. The Star\nends with a depiction of what is seen in this vision\u2014God\u2019s face\nin the form of the star of redemption\u2014and then guides\nthe reader out from the setting of such vision back into everyday\nlife.\n",
