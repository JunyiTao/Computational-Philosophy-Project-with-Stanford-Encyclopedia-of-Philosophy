    "main_text": "Should we doubt the evidential force of intellectual intuitions? || Naturalized epistemology\n6.4 Naturalized epistemology\n\nThere are other objections to the reliance on intuitions in philosophy\nthat do not call into question their reliability. They call into\nquestion their relevance. Casullo (2003) proposes to treat\n\u201cexperience\u201d as a natural kind term, and Hilary Kornblith\nand Philip Kitcher propose to treat epistemic terms such as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cjustification\u201d in that way\ntoo. Kornblith thinks that intuitions can help direct us to the\nappropriate objects, or phenomena, of investigation but not much more.\nFor instance, we have an intuition that knowledge is not a type of\nfurniture so we should not start our empirical investigation into the\nessential nature of knowledge by looking at furniture (Kornblith 1998,\n2005, 2006). If we think of normative terms such as\n\u201cwrong\u201d as natural kind terms, and so as analogous to a\nnatural kind term like \u201cwater\u201d, there would be some\nreference-fixing description associated with \u201cwrong\u201d as\nthere is for \u201cwater\u201d. For \u201cwater\u201d that\ndescription is something like: the stuff, whatever it is,\nthat in the actual world has the properties of quenching\nthirst, putting out certain fires, falling from the clouds as rain,\nfilling the lakes and rivers, etc., on the planet on which we live.\nEmpirical investigation is then needed to discover what this\nreference-fixing description in fact refers to. On Kornblith\u2019s\nview, there is little room for rational intuitions to play in\ndiscovering the essential nature of knowledge or normative kinds. They\ndo not play a role in determining the content of any relevant\nreference-fixing description and, at most, tell us where not\nto look to find what does fulfill a given description.\n\nIt would be a mistake to take \u201ccube\u201d to be a natural kind\nterm understood through some reference-fixing description such as: a\nthree-dimensional solid that looks such-and-such a way when looked at\nfrom various angles and that feels so-and-so when turned around in\nyour hands; is able to fit snugly through square holes cut out of a\nboard, etc. \u201cCube\u201d is not a natural kind term and we\nunderstand what a cube is through understanding its definition,\nnamely, a three-dimensional solid with six faces all of which are\nsquares.\n\nRational intuitions seem relevant to testing proposed definitions of\n\u201ccube\u201d, but not proposed reference-fixing descriptions of\n\u201cwater\u201d. If someone thought that the correct definition of\n\u201ccube\u201d is: a three-dimensional solid with six faces\nall of which are parallelograms with equal sides, we could show\nit is not a correct definition of \u201ccube\u201d by imagining a\n\u201csquished\u201d cube that satisfies that definition but,\nintuitively, is not a cube. None of the properties mentioned in the\nreference-fixing description for water are either necessary, or taken\nsingly or together, sufficient conditions of a liquid\u2019s being\nwater. So it does not seem that rational intuitions could play much of\na role in determining what the essential nature of knowledge is if\n\u201cknowledge\u201d were a natural kind term whose reference is\nfixed by some description. People would have to empirically discover\nthe nature of knowledge with the aid of its reference-fixing\ndescription, just as they had to empirically discover the nature of\nwater. The same thing would seem to apply to normative terms like\n\u201cright\u201d or \u201cwhat there is most reason to do (or\nbelieve)\u201d if they were natural kind terms.\n\nOn the basis of thinking about these examples involving\n\u201cwater\u201d and \u201ccube\u201d, a person might think that\nwhether rational intuitions have a small or a large role in\ndiscovering the essential nature of normative concepts, and other\nconcepts of interest to philosophers, depends on whether those\nconcepts are like the concept of water or instead like that\nof cube. But Peter Railton\u2019s view that normative terms\nare natural kind terms allows for a large role for rational intuitions\nin determining their reference-fixing descriptions.\n\nRailton calls a reference-fixing description a \u201cjob\ndescription\u201d. He is interested in normative concepts like\nright and what there is most reason to do, and\ndescribes in general terms what a job description might include.\nRailton says that there may not be much to say about \u201cthe\nconcept of a reason full stop\u201d. Perhaps all we can say\nin that regard is that a reason is a consideration that counts in\nfavor of something: an action, a desire, an emotion, a belief, etc.\nBut Railton thinks that the concept most reason to do has\n\n\n\na distinctive, all-important role in your conceptual scheme\u2014it\nexpresses \u201cstops the buck\u201d in deliberating and deciding\nwhat we ought to do, what ultimately matters. \n\n\nHe goes on to add that the relevant \u201cjob description\u201d\nincludes reference to paradigm cases. For example, it is assumed that\nagony gives everyone some reason to avoid performing actions that\nproduce it, that vengeance is not itself a reason to do something, and\nthat acrophobia sometimes is not a sufficient reason to avoid doing\nsomething that will save your life (Railton 2017a: 51).\n\nIn another essay on Parfit\u2019s On What Matters, Vol III,\nRailton says that the job description of rightness is \n\n\nnecessarily connected to the guidance of deliberation,\u2026,has\nanalytic connections to ought claims about action and\nmotivation,\u2026,has certain paradigm cases, etc. \n\n\nHe thinks that the job description of minimizing suffering is\ncompletely different (Railton 2017b: 118\u2013119). Nevertheless,\nRailton thinks that the two concepts might refer to the same thing in\nthe way that water and H2O refer to the\nsame thing despite being different concepts. That will be true if the\nacts that have the naturalistic property of minimizing suffering\nuniquely (or best) fulfill the job description associated with the\nnormative concept rightness.\n\nRational intuitions might play a role in Railton\u2019s view that\nnormative terms are natural kind terms by supplying the paradigm cases\nthat are elements of the job descriptions associated with normative\nconcepts. He says that it is \u201cinconceivable\u201d that there\nnot be reason to stop prolonged agony that is being inflicted on\nsomeone just for amusement (2017a: 56). On Railton\u2019s view, to\ndetermine what the natures of right, reason, most reason, etc., are\nyou need to consider more than just what rational intuitions might\nreveal. They can help determine what paradigm cases should be included\nin the relevant \u201cjob description\u201d, but that description\nincludes more than just paradigm cases. On Railton\u2019s view,\ninsofar as \u201cold style\u201d analytic philosophy only considered\nthe data supplied by rational intuitions, it mistakenly left important\ndata aside. This is true of attempts to analyze normative concepts but\nalso true of attempts to analyze other concepts that have been of\ninterest to philosophers, for example, knowledge, causality,\npersonal identity, justice, being morally responsible, acting\nfreely, etc.\n\nRailton\u2019s view is that normative concepts are hybrid concepts,\nsomewhat like the concept of ruby as a red gemstone\nwith such-and-such chemical structure (see\n example 15)\n or of an ice cube. \u201cIce\u201d is a natural kind term,\nor at least its definition as \u201cfrozen water\u201d is partly\ngiven by the natural kind term, \u201cwater\u201d. But, as we have\nseen, \u201ccube\u201d is not a natural kind terms. So \u201cice\ncube\u201d is partly a natural kind term and partly not.\n",
