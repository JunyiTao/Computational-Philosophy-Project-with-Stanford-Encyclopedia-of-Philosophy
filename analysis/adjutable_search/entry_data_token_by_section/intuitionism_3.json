    "main_text": "Mathematics\n3. Mathematics\n\nAlthough Brouwer\u2019s development of intuitionism played an\nimportant role in the foundational debate among mathematicians at the\nbeginning of the 20th century, the far reaching implications of his\nphilosophy for mathematics became only apparent after many years of\nresearch. The two most characteristic properties of intuitionism are\nthe logical principles of reasoning that it allows in proofs and the\nfull conception of the intuitionistic continuum. Only as far as the\nlatter is concerned, intuitionism becomes incomparable with classical\nmathematics. In this entry the focus is on those principles of\nintuitionism that set it apart from other mathematical disciplines,\nand therefore its other constructive aspects will be treated in less\ndetail. \n",
