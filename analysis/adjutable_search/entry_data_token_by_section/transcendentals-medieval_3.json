Three Models of the Transcendentals: Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent and Eckhart, and John Duns Scotus\n\n\nFrom 1225 onwards, a series of medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals was formulated by such diverse authors as Philip the\nChancellor, the authors of the Summa Halensis, Bonaventure,\nand Albert the Great that are centered, for historical\n reasons,[2]\non the transcendentality of the good.\nBetween 1250 and 1330, the doctrine reached its maturity in the works\nof Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, the early\nScotists, and William of Ockham. The whole tradition of reflection on\nthe transcendental properties of being was synthesized in the\nDisputationes metaphysicae of Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n(published 1597), which built the most elaborate account of the\ntranscendentals known in the high and later Middle Ages.\n\n\nInsight into the variety of medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals, however, is better served by the contrast of typical\nmodels of a doctrine of the transcendentals than by an overview of the\nhistory of the transcendentals tout\n court.[3]\nApart from the differences in the internal\nconnection of the transcendental concepts, one of the most important\naspects on which these different models of a doctrine of the\ntranscendentals vary is the relation between the transcendental and the\ntranscendent. According to Thomas Aquinas, transcendental being extends\nonly to created being, whereas Henry of Ghent and Meister Eckhart\nformulate a doctrine of the transcendentals in which God is the first\nknown; Duns Scotus, finally, makes transcendental being indifferent to\nfinite and infinite being; it is univocally common to God and creature.\n(See Aertsen 2012, 666.)\n",
