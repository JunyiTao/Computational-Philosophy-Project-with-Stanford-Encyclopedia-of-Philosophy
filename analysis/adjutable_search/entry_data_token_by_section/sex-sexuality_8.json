    "main_text": "Normative Issues || Sex and Technology\n2.4 Sex and Technology\n\nThe discussion of sexual exclusion and inclusion has led some\nphilosophers to suggest that sexual needs can be met by sexual robots\nthat can replace the need for partnered sex, especially if the\ntechnology is advanced enough so that sex with the robots provides an\nalmost identical experience to sex with another human being (DiNucci\n2017; McArthur 2017). This raises a few philosophical questions of its\nown. First, if the robots are sophisticated enough, they might be\npersons, which means that they, too, might have rights to sexual\nautonomy, which takes us back to the same issues with rights to\npartnered sex. It also raises the general question of how to morally\ninteract with them (Nyholm 2022; Petersen 2017).\n\nSecond, there are feminist concerns as to what these robots would look\nlike: if they are meant to \u201cappeal to a stereotypical male\ngaze,\u201d then \u201ctheir use might encourage or exacerbate the\nobjectification and dehumanization of actual women\u201d (Liberman\n2022, 458). Another feminist concern, regardless of the robots\u2019\nlook, is that ease of sex with them, and their inability to genuinely\nrefuse sex, might also entrench sexist attitudes toward women,\nespecially that of male entitlement to sex (Danaher, Earp, and\nSandberg 2017; Richardson 2005).\n\nIssues with sex robots do not exhaust those of sex and technology.\nAnother has to do with the effects on our lives of the use of dating\nand hook up apps, weighing their benefits and their costs. While such\napps have allowed people to meet each other with more ease and to be\nselective in their choices, some worry that they allow them to be\ntoo selective, abetting lookism and racist desires (McArthur\n2022a and 2022b; see also Klincewicz, Frank, and Jane 2022). Neil\nMcArthur argues that the benefits are greater than the costs, many of\nwhich can, anyway, be fixed (2022a, 2022b).\n\nMcArthur also argues that technology has given rise to a new sexual\nidentity\u2014digisexuality. Digisexuals are \u201cpeople for whom\nadvanced technologies are an integral part of their preferred sexual\nexperience, and who might not see the need for human sexual partners\nin order to have fulfilling sex\u201d (2022a, 342). McArthur thinks\nthat new identities are a good thing, because they allow like-minded\npeople to find each other, and such identities can help usher in legal\nand social protections (if needed).\n\nIn addition to robots and apps, a third issue with sexual technology\nare \u201cInternet-mediated haptic sex toys capable of remote\ntransmission of tactile sensation\u201d (Arrell 2022, 586). Such\ntechnologies have a large array of benefits, but they raise their own\nproblems, such as third parties hacking the systems and thus having\nsex by deception or assaulting one or more of the parties to the\nsystems, and partners claiming to be something other than who they\nare, such that even if one is not deceived that one is having sex\nwith, say, John, who John says he is, is not who he actually is\n(Sparrow and Karas 2020).\n\nVirtual reality and augmented reality technologies (or, more\ngenerally, extended reality technologies) are, according to Robbie\nArrell, more likely than androids to be the future because they are\ncheaper, multi-purposed, can be moved around and stored more easily,\nand they are but a short step from current pornography technology\n(2022, 595). Although these technologies have benefits, they raise the\nmoral worries of deepfakes and the possibility of people coming to\nprefer sex through them than with real-life sex partners (Arrell 2022,\n595\u2013596).\n",
