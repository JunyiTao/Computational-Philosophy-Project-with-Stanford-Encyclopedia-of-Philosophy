    "main_text": "Three tasks of process philosophy\n2. Three tasks of process philosophy\n\nAs may have become clear from the brief review of historical\ncontributions to (Western) process philosophy in section 1, process\nphilosophy is a complex and highly diversified field that is not tied\nto any school, method, position, or even paradigmatic notion of\nprocess. Some process philosophers (e.g. Whitehead) took organismic\nprocesses as their central model for a concept of occurrences that\ngenerate the internal and external coherence of an entity. Others\n(e.g. James) chose as their canonical illustrations individual\npsychological processes, or (e.g. Alexander) took evolutionary\ndevelopment as paradigmatic. Some process philosophers (e.g. Whitehead\nand Morgan) articulated their approach in the form of an axiomatic\ntheory and in close relation to science, while others (e.g. Bergson)\nworked from an almost mystical sort of sympathetic apprehension of\nreality and insisted that process metaphysics could, if at all, only\nbe expressed by means of a highly metaphorical use of language. Some\nprocessists (e.g., Roger Boscovich) championed a materialist position,\nwhile others endorsed idealism (e.g., Leibniz and Hegel). The\nhistorical overview in the preceding section also displays that the\ntools of process philosophy are not tied to any specific method of\nphilosophical inquiry, giving present-day process philosophers a broad\nspectrum of approaches with which to build their theories: by\nconceptual analysis (via informal and formal reconstructions of\nconceptual contents); by the integrative interpretation of scientific\nresults; or by phenomenological investigations. Similarly, while\ncompatibility with recent results of science is for many process\nphilosophers a privileged methodological constraint, others take\nscience to be merely an aspect of the more comprehensive philosophical\ndatum of cultural praxis.\n\nIn short, process philosophy is best understood as the effort to\nreplace a longstanding philosophical research paradigm, in a\nsense close to T. Kuhn\u2019s use of the term, i.e., to replace a set\nof longstanding fundamental assumptions that delimit the scope of\nlegitimate topics and direct theory construction. For example, process\nphilosophers assume that the only primary or basic ontological\ncategories should be terms for occurring entities, and that\ncertain formal theories\u2014for example, set theory\u2014are\nill-suited of themselves, without modifications, to express the\ndynamic relationships among occurrences. Or again, process thinkers\nhold that philosophical research may legitimately address\n\u2018creative\u2019 phenomena that cannot be described as the\nmodification of a pre-existing and persistent unit, such as phenomena\nof complexity or self-organization. What unifies contemporary\nprocess-philosophical research more than any other aspect, however, is\nits metaphilosophical aim to revise long-standing theoretical habits.\nGiven its current role as a rival to the dominant substance-geared\nparadigm of Western metaphysics, process philosophy has the\noverarching task of establishing the following three claims:\n\nClaim 1: The basic assumptions of the \u2018substance\nparadigm\u2019 (i.e., a metaphysics based on static entities such as\nsubstances, objects, states of affairs, or instantaneous stages) are\ndispensable theoretical presuppositions rather than laws of\nthought.\nClaim 2: Process-based theories perform just as well or\nbetter than substance-based theories in application to the familiar\nphilosophical topics identified within the substance paradigm.\nClaim 3: There are other important philosophical topics\nthat can only be addressed within a process metaphysics.\n\n\nContributions to current process-philosophical research typically\nfocus on (aspects of) only one of these three components of a theory\n revision.[3]\n More often than not, however, the larger purpose of the contribution\nremains implicit, which is one of the reasons why contemporary process\nphilosophy, especially non-Whiteheadian process thought, does not\nclearly stand out as a unified effort at theory revision. Process\nphilosophy currently presents itself as an internally diversified,\ngeographically and disciplinarily distributed phenomenon of innovative\nthought in Western philosophy. Accordingly, there are significant\ndifferences in how process philosophers approach claims (1)\u2013(3).\nIn the following the focus will be on arguments for claims\n(1)\u2013(3) within contemporary analytical process philosophy. The\nreader should thus keep in mind that the pointers set in the following\nsections are partially representative at best and need to be\nsupplemented by introductions to, e.g., contemporary\n Whiteheadian\n process thought and French process thought\n (Gilles Deleuze,\n Alain Badiou). In addition, pointers to process-philosophical\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion are all but omitted, since\nextensive and in-depth treatments are provided in the entries on\n Charles Hartshorne\n and\n process theism.\n\nIn order to support (Claim 1), two strategies have been pursued. The\nfirst strategy is to argue that the core assumptions of the substance\nparadigm\u2014especially the focus on discrete, countable, static\nindividuals and the neglect of dynamic aspects\u2014simply reflect\nthe cognitive dispositions that are typical for the speakers of the\nlanguages in which Western metaphysics were mainly developed, such as\nAncient Greek, Latin, German, and\n English.[4]\n The second strategy is to select a well-known argument for the\nnecessity of substance-based metaphysics and to show that it involves\na petitio principii. For example, consider Peter F.\nStrawson\u2019s widely accepted argument against the very possibility\nof process\n metaphysics.[5]\n Strawson\u2019s argument can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nFor objective and identifiable concrete entities to be knowable,\nthey must be (i) distinguishable from other co-existents, and (ii)\nreidentifiable for one or more members in a community of speakers and\nknowers.\nDistinguishability and reidentifiability are conditions of\n\u201creferential identification\u201d for a community of knowers;\nthey require a matrix for the emplacement of our experiential\nencounters with entities in a unified all-encompassing framework of\ncoordination.\nSpatio-temporal location provides such a matrix; in order to\nconstitute the space-time framework essential for interpersonal\ncommunication entities must \u201cconfer upon it their own\nfundamental characteristics. That is to say they must be\nthree-dimensional objects with some endurance through time \u2026\nThey must collectively have enough diversity, richness, stability, and\nendurance to make possible just that conception of a single unitary\n[space-time] framework which we possess\u201d (Strawson 1959, p.\n39).\nOnly one category of entities possesses these required features:\n\u201cOf the categories of object which we recognize, only those\nsatisfy these requirements which are, or possess, material\nbodies\u2014in the broad sense of the expression. Hence given a\ncertain general feature of the conceptual scheme which we possess, and\ngiven the character of available major categories, things which are,\nor possess, material bodies must be [epistemologically] basic\nparticulars\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\nIf this line of reasoning were correct, the substance paradigm would\nbe indispensable, and (Claim 1) above would be false. For it is clear\nthat any viable metaphysical theory must have room for identifiable\nindividuals that can be located in space and time. However, step (4)\nin Strawson\u2019s argument begs the question on two counts.\n\nAll of the conditions that Strawson requires in step (3) (diversity,\nrichness, stability, and endurance or transtemporal sameness) arguably\nare fulfilled as much by the entities that we conceptualize as\nphysical processes as by entities that \u201care or possess\nbodies.\u201d For example, William Penn (2022) recently argued for an\nexclusively process-based version of scientific realism\u2014already\nthe praxis of natural science, but in particular also the scientific\nmodels for the fundamental constitution of matter, commits to a\nthoroughly processual ontology without underlying \u201cbasic\nparticulars\u201d: the stability of recurrent dynamic patterns does\nnot entail staticity. Furthermore, one might argue that the entities\nwe conceptualize as processes are physically realized without being\nliterally embodied, and for some of them it holds that we can point at\nthem and distinguish them (\u201cthis trickle versus that\ntrickle\u201d) and re-identify them (\u201cthe trickle was gone for\na minute, but then it came again\u201d). In nature\u2019s\nspatio-temporal framework we distinguish and re-identify both\nthings and processes. That Strawson\u2019s argument could have\nappeared plausible is perhaps due to the fact that his illustrations\nfor processes are sounds and explosions, which are not, like many\nother physical processes, lasting occurrences with determinate\nlocation (such as fires, tornadoes, or waterfalls). The initial\nplausibility of step (4) may also derive from a core assumption of the\nsubstance paradigm, namely, the thesis that all processes can be\nontologically understood as modifications of substances. On this\nreductionist view, all processes are \u2018owned\u2019 and we\nidentify them via their owner: the murder of C\u00e6sar, the\nconstruction of the forbidden city, etc. But the fact that\nthese processes involve certain things and persons is merely one of\nthe aspects that an ontological interpretation of processes should\ncapture, and not a decisive one, since many processes (e.g.,\ntornadoes, lightening bolts, today\u2019s rush-hour in New York) lack\na proper \u2018subject\u2019 altogether.\n\nEven more important is the second question-begging element involved in\nstep (4) of Strawson\u2019s argument, for it displays the theoretical\nbias of the substance paradigm at a more fundamental level. Strawson\nsets up conditions for the ontological category or entity type that\ncan constitute a space-time framework and claims in step (4) (i) that\n\u201cthings that are or possess bodies\u201d can fulfill these\nconditions, and (ii) that therefore such things are\n\u201cbasic particulars.\u201d In this way Strawson turns a common\nsense concept, viz. \u201cmaterial thing,\u201d into a basic\nontological category without asking whether it is possible that what\nwe common-sensically call a \u2018thing\u2019 might not also\nontologically be interpreted in terms of a category from process\nmetaphysics (e.g., as a bundle of activities or, in a Whiteheadian\nfashion, as ongoing pattern of events). Strawson elsewhere rejects\nsuch an interpretation as \u201crevisionary metaphysics\u201d while\nmetaphysics based on material things or substances is\n\u201cdescriptive,\u201d but these adjectives are themselves in need\nof a convincing justification\u2014as long as an ontological category\nfully captures the inferential content of a common sense concept, it\nis as descriptive as any other.\n\nIn short, then, Strawson\u2019s argument fails on two counts. It is\nsimply not the case that material things are the indispensable basis\nfor a framework of knowable, uniquely located, re-identifiable items.\nPhysical processes of a suitable sort can accomplish this task as\nwell. Moreover, even if material things were the only candidates for\nepistemically reidentifiable items, it still would be an open question\nhow we should interpret things ontologically. To be sure, the rebuttal\nof Strawson\u2019s argument does not suffice to establish Claim\n1, but it keeps process philosophy in the running.\n",
