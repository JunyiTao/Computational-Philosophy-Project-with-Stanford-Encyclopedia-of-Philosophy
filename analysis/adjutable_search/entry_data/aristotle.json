    "preamble": "\n\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.) numbers among the greatest\nphilosophers of all time. Judged solely in terms of his philosophical\ninfluence, only Plato is his peer: Aristotle\u2019s works shaped centuries\nof philosophy from Late Antiquity through the Renaissance, and even\ntoday continue to be studied with keen, non-antiquarian interest. A\nprodigious researcher and writer, Aristotle left a great body of work,\nperhaps numbering as many as two-hundred treatises, from which\napproximately thirty-one\n survive.[1] \n His extant writings span a wide range of\ndisciplines, from logic, metaphysics and philosophy of mind, through\nethics, political theory, aesthetics and rhetoric, and into such\nprimarily non-philosophical fields as empirical biology, where he\nexcelled at detailed plant and animal observation and description. \nIn all these areas, Aristotle\u2019s theories have provided\nillumination, met with resistance, sparked debate, and generally\nstimulated the sustained interest of an abiding readership.\n\n\nBecause of its wide range and its remoteness in time,\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy defies easy encapsulation. The long\nhistory of interpretation and appropriation of Aristotelian texts and\nthemes\u2014spanning over two millennia and comprising philosophers\nworking within a variety of religious and secular traditions\u2014has\nrendered even basic points of interpretation controversial. The\nset of entries on Aristotle in this site addresses this situation by\nproceeding in three tiers. First, the present, general entry\noffers a brief account of Aristotle\u2019s life and characterizes his\ncentral philosophical commitments, highlighting his most distinctive\nmethods and most influential\n achievements.[2] \n Second are General Topics, which offer detailed introductions\nto the main areas of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical activity. Finally,\nthere follow Special Topics, which investigate in greater\ndetail more narrowly focused issues, especially those of central\nconcern in recent Aristotelian scholarship. \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Aristotle\u2019s Life\n\n\n           \nBorn in 384 B.C.E. in the Macedonian region of northeastern Greece in\nthe small city of Stagira (whence the moniker \u2018the\nStagirite\u2019, which one still occasionally encounters in\nAristotelian scholarship), Aristotle was sent to Athens at about the\nage of seventeen to study in Plato\u2019s Academy, then a pre-eminent\nplace of learning in the Greek world. Once in Athens, Aristotle\nremained associated with the Academy until Plato\u2019s death in 347,\nat which time he left for Assos, in Asia Minor, on the northwest coast\nof present-day Turkey. There he continued the philosophical activity\nhe had begun in the Academy, but in all likelihood also began to\nexpand his researches into marine biology. He remained at Assos for\napproximately three years, when, evidently upon the death of his host\nHermeias, a friend and former Academic who had been the ruler of\nAssos, Aristotle moved to the nearby coastal island of Lesbos. There\nhe continued his philosophical and empirical researches for an\nadditional two years, working in conjunction with Theophrastus, a\nnative of Lesbos who was also reported in antiquity to have been\nassociated with Plato\u2019s Academy. While in Lesbos, Aristotle\nmarried Pythias, the niece of Hermeias, with whom he had a daughter,\nalso named Pythias.\n\n\nIn 343, upon the request of Philip, the king of Macedon, Aristotle\nleft Lesbos for Pella, the Macedonian capital, in order to tutor the\nking\u2019s thirteen-year-old son, Alexander\u2014the boy who was\neventually to become Alexander the Great. Although speculation\nconcerning Aristotle\u2019s influence upon the developing Alexander has\nproven irresistible to historians, in fact little concrete is known\nabout their interaction. On the balance, it seems reasonable to\nconclude that some tuition took place, but that it lasted only two or\nthree years, when Alexander was aged from thirteen to fifteen. By\nfifteen, Alexander was apparently already serving as a deputy military\ncommander for his father, a circumstance undermining, if\ninconclusively, the judgment of those historians who conjecture a\nlonger period of tuition. Be that as it may, some suppose that their\nassociation lasted as long as eight years.\n\n\nIt is difficult to rule out that possibility decisively, since little\nis known about the period of Aristotle\u2019s life from\n341\u2013335.  He evidently remained a further five years in Stagira\nor Macedon before returning to Athens for the second and final time,\nin 335. In Athens, Aristotle set up his own school in a public\nexercise area dedicated to the god Apollo Lykeios, whence its name,\nthe Lyceum.  Those affiliated with Aristotle\u2019s school\nlater came to be called Peripatetics, probably because of the\nexistence of an ambulatory (peripatos) on the school\u2019s\nproperty adjacent to the exercise ground.  Members of the Lyceum\nconducted research into a wide range of subjects, all of which were of\ninterest to Aristotle himself: botany, biology, logic, music,\nmathematics, astronomy, medicine, cosmology, physics, the history of\nphilosophy, metaphysics, psychology, ethics, theology, rhetoric,\npolitical history, government and political theory, and the arts. In\nall these areas, the Lyceum collected manuscripts, thereby, according\nto some ancient accounts, assembling the first great library of\nantiquity. \n\n\nDuring this period, Aristotle\u2019s wife, Pythias, died and he\ndeveloped a new relationship with Herpyllis, perhaps like him a native\nof Stagira, though her origins are disputed, as is the question of her\nexact relationship to Aristotle. Some suppose that she was merely his\nslave; others infer from the provisions of Aristotle\u2019s will that\nshe was a freed woman and likely his wife at the time of his\ndeath. In any event, they had children together, including a son,\nNicomachus, named for Aristotle\u2019s father and after whom his\nNicomachean Ethics is presumably named.\n\n\nAfter thirteen years in Athens, Aristotle once again found cause to\nretire from the city, in 323. Probably his departure was\noccasioned by a resurgence of the always-simmering anti-Macedonian\nsentiment in Athens, which was free to come to the boil after Alexander\nsuccumbed to disease in Babylon during that same year. Because of\nhis connections to Macedon, Aristotle reasonably feared for his safety\nand left Athens, remarking, as an oft-repeated ancient tale would tell\nit, that he saw no reason to permit Athens to sin twice against\nphilosophy. He withdrew directly to Chalcis, on Euboea, an island\noff the Attic coast, and died there of natural causes the following\nyear, in\n 322.[3]\n2. The Aristotelian Corpus: Character and Primary Divisions\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s writings tend to present formidable difficulties to\nhis novice readers. To begin, he makes heavy use of unexplained\ntechnical terminology, and his sentence structure can at times prove\nfrustrating. Further, on occasion a chapter or even a full\ntreatise coming down to us under his name appears haphazardly\norganized, if organized at all; indeed, in several cases, scholars\ndispute whether a continuous treatise currently arranged under a single\ntitle was ever intended by Aristotle to be published in its present\nform or was rather stitched together by some later editor employing\nwhatever principles of organization he deemed\n suitable.[4] \n This helps explain why\nstudents who turn to Aristotle after first being introduced to the\nsupple and mellifluous prose on display in Plato\u2019s dialogues\noften find the experience frustrating. Aristotle\u2019s prose\nrequires some acclimatization.\n\n           \nAll the more puzzling, then, is Cicero\u2019s observation that if\nPlato\u2019s prose was silver, Aristotle\u2019s was a flowing river\nof gold (Ac. Pr. 38.119, cf. Top. 1.3, De\nor. 1.2.49). Cicero was arguably the greatest prose stylist of\nLatin and was also without question an accomplished and fair-minded\ncritic of the prose styles of others writing in both Latin and\nGreek. We must assume, then, that Cicero had before him works of\nAristotle other than those we possess. In fact, we know that\nAristotle wrote dialogues, presumably while still in the Academy, and\nin their few surviving remnants we are afforded a glimpse of the style\nCicero describes. In most of what we possess, unfortunately, we\nfind work of a much less polished character. Rather,\nAristotle\u2019s extant works read like what they very probably are:\nlecture notes, drafts first written and then reworked, ongoing records\nof continuing investigations, and, generally speaking, in-house\ncompilations intended not for a general audience but for an inner\ncircle of auditors. These are to be contrasted with the\n\u201cexoteric\u201d writings Aristotle sometimes mentions, his more\ngraceful compositions intended for a wider audience (Pol.\n1278b30; EE 1217b22, 1218b34). Unfortunately, then, we\nare left for the most part, though certainly not entirely, with\nunfinished works in progress rather than with finished and polished\nproductions. Still, many of those who persist with Aristotle come\nto appreciate the unembellished directness of his style.\n\n\n           \nMore importantly, the unvarnished condition of Aristotle\u2019s\nsurviving treatises does not hamper our ability to come to grips with their\nphilosophical content. His thirty-one surviving works (that is,\nthose contained in the \u201cCorpus Aristotelicum\u201d of our\nmedieval manuscripts that are judged to be authentic) all contain\nrecognizably Aristotelian doctrine; and most of these contain theses\nwhose basic purport is clear, even where matters of detail and nuance\nare subject to exegetical controversy. \n\n\n           \nThese works may be categorized in terms of the intuitive\norganizational principles preferred by Aristotle. He refers to the\nbranches of learning as \u201csciences\u201d\n(epist\u00eamai), best regarded as organized bodies of\nlearning completed for presentation rather than as ongoing records of\nempirical researches. Moreover, again in his terminology, natural\nsciences such as physics are but one branch of theoretical\nscience, which comprises both empirical and non-empirical\npursuits. He distinguishes theoretical science from more practically\noriented studies, some of which concern human conduct and others of\nwhich focus on the productive crafts. Thus, the Aristotelian sciences\ndivide into three: (i) theoretical, (ii) practical, and (iii)\nproductive.  The principles of division are straightforward:\ntheoretical science seeks knowledge for its own sake; practical\nscience concerns conduct and goodness in action, both individual and\nsocietal; and productive science aims at the creation of beautiful or\nuseful objects (Top. 145a15\u201316;\nPhys. 192b8\u201312; DC 298a27\u201332,\nDA 403a27\u2013b2; Met. 1025b25, 1026a18\u201319,\n1064a16\u201319, b1\u20133; EN 1139a26\u201328,\n1141b29\u201332).\n\n\n(i) The theoretical sciences include prominently what\nAristotle calls first philosophy, or metaphysics as we now\ncall it, but also mathematics, and physics, or\nnatural philosophy.  Physics studies the natural universe as a\nwhole, and tends in Aristotle\u2019s hands to concentrate on\nconceptual puzzles pertaining to nature rather than on empirical research;\nbut it reaches further, so that it includes also a theory of causal\nexplanation and finally even a proof of an unmoved mover thought to be\nthe first and final cause of all motion. Many of the puzzles of primary\nconcern to Aristotle have proven perennially attractive to\nphilosophers, mathematicians, and theoretically inclined natural\nscientists. They include, as a small sample, Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes of motion, puzzles about time, the nature of place, and\ndifficulties encountered in thought about the infinite. \n\n\nNatural philosophy also incorporates the special sciences, including\nbiology, botany, and astronomical theory. Most contemporary\ncritics think that Aristotle treats psychology as a sub-branch of\nnatural philosophy, because he regards the soul (psuch\u00ea)\nas the basic principle of life, including all animal and plant\nlife. In fact, however, the evidence for this conclusion is\ninconclusive at best. It is instructive to note that earlier periods of\nAristotelian scholarship thought this controversial, so that, for\ninstance, even something as innocuous-sounding as the question of the\nproper home of psychology in Aristotle\u2019s division of the sciences\nignited a multi-decade debate in the\n Renaissance.[5] \n\n\n(ii) Practical sciences are less contentious, at least as\nregards their range. These deal with conduct and action, both\nindividual and societal. Practical science thus contrasts with\ntheoretical science, which seeks knowledge for its own sake, and, less\nobviously, with the productive sciences, which deal with the creation\nof products external to sciences themselves. Both politics and\nethics fall under this branch.\n\n\n(iii) Finally, then, the productive sciences are mainly\ncrafts aimed at the production of artefacts, or of human productions\nmore broadly construed. The productive sciences include, among\nothers, ship-building, agriculture, and medicine, but also the arts of\nmusic, theatre, and dance. Another form of productive science is\nrhetoric, which treats the principles of speech-making appropriate to\nvarious forensic and persuasive settings, including centrally political\nassemblies.\n\n\nSignificantly, Aristotle\u2019s tri-fold division of the sciences\nmakes no mention of logic. Although he did not use the word\n\u2018logic\u2019 in our sense of the term, Aristotle in fact\ndeveloped the first formalized system of logic and valid\ninference. In Aristotle\u2019s framework\u2014although he is\nnowhere explicit about this\u2014logic belongs to no one science, but\nrather formulates the principles of correct argumentation suitable to\nall areas of inquiry in common. It systematizes the principles\nlicensing acceptable inference, and helps to highlight at an abstract\nlevel seductive patterns of incorrect inference to be avoided by anyone\nwith a primary interest in truth.   So, alongside his more\ntechnical work in logic and logical theory, Aristotle investigates\ninformal styles of argumentation and seeks to expose common patterns of\nfallacious reasoning.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s investigations into logic and the forms of\nargumentation make up part of the group of works coming down to us from\nthe Middle Ages under the heading the Organon\n(organon = tool in Greek). Although not so\ncharacterized in these terms by Aristotle, the name is apt, so long as\nit is borne in mind that intellectual inquiry requires a broad range of\ntools. Thus, in addition to logic and argumentation (treated\nprimarily in the Prior Analytics and Topics), the\nworks included in the Organon deal with category theory, the\ndoctrine of propositions and terms, the structure of scientific theory,\nand to some extent the basic principles of epistemology.\n\n\n           \nWhen we slot Aristotle\u2019s most important surviving authentic works\ninto this scheme, we end up with the following basic\ndivisions of his major writings:\n\nOrganon\n\n \nCategories (Cat.)\nDe Interpretatione (DI) [On Interpretation]\nPrior Analytics (APr)\nPosterior Analytics (APo)\nTopics (Top.)\nSophistical Refutations (SE)\n\n\nTheoretical Sciences\n\n \nPhysics (Phys.)\nGeneration and Corruption (Gen. et Corr.)\nDe Caelo (DC) [On the Heavens]\nMetaphysics (Met.)\nDe Anima (DA) [On the Soul]\nParva Naturalia (PN) [Brief Natural Treatises]\nHistory of Animals (HA)\nParts of Animals (PA)\nMovement of Animals (MA)\nMeteorology (Meteor.)\nProgression of Animals (IA)\nGeneration of Animals (GA)\n\n\nPractical Sciences\n\n \nNicomachean Ethics (EN)\nEudemian Ethics (EE)\nMagna Moralia (MM) [Great Ethics]\nPolitics (Pol.)\n\n\nProductive Science\n \n \nRhetoric (Rhet.)\nPoetics (Poet.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe titles in this list are those in most common use today in\nEnglish-language scholarship, followed by standard abbreviations in\nparentheses. For no discernible reason, Latin titles are\ncustomarily employed in some cases, English in others. Where\nLatin titles are in general use, English equivalents are given in\nsquare brackets.\n3. Phainomena and the Endoxic Method\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s basic approach to philosophy is best grasped initially by\nway of contrast. Whereas Descartes seeks to place philosophy and\nscience on firm foundations by subjecting all knowledge claims to a\nsearing methodological doubt, Aristotle begins with the conviction\nthat our perceptual and cognitive faculties are basically dependable,\nthat they for the most part put us into direct contact with the\nfeatures and divisions of our world, and that we need not dally with\nsceptical postures before engaging in substantive philosophy.\nAccordingly, he proceeds in all areas of inquiry in the manner of a\nmodern-day natural scientist, who takes it for granted that progress\nfollows the assiduous application of a well-trained mind and so, when\npresented with a problem, simply goes to work.  When he goes to work,\nAristotle begins by considering how the world appears, reflecting on\nthe puzzles those appearances throw up, and reviewing what has been\nsaid about those puzzles to date. These methods comprise his twin\nappeals to phainomena and the endoxic method. \n\n\n           \nThese two methods reflect in different ways Aristotle\u2019s deepest\nmotivations for doing philosophy in the first place. \u201cHuman\nbeings began to do philosophy,\u201d he says, \u201ceven as they do\nnow, because of wonder, at first because they wondered about the\nstrange things right in front of them, and then later, advancing\nlittle by little, because they came to find greater things\npuzzling\u201d (Met. 982b12). Human beings philosophize,\naccording to Aristotle, because they find aspects of their experience\npuzzling. The sorts of puzzles we encounter in thinking about the\nuniverse and our place within it\u2014aporiai, in\nAristotle\u2019s terminology\u2014tax our understanding and induce us to\nphilosophize.\n\n\n           \nAccording to Aristotle, it behooves us to begin philosophizing by\nlaying out the phainomena, the appearances, or, more\nfully, things appearing to be the case, and then also\ncollecting the endoxa, the credible opinions handed down\nregarding matters we find puzzling. As a typical example, in a\npassage of his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle confronts a\npuzzle of human conduct, the fact that we are apparently sometimes\nakratic or weak-willed. When introducing this puzzle, Aristotle pauses\nto reflect upon a precept governing his approach to many areas of inquiry:\n\n\nAs in other cases, we must set out the appearances\n(phainomena) and run through all the puzzles regarding\nthem. In this way we must prove the credible opinions\n(endoxa) about these sorts of experiences\u2014ideally, all\nthe credible opinions, but if not all, then most of them, those which\nare the most important. For if the objections are answered and\nthe credible opinions remain, we shall have an adequate proof.\n(EN 1145b2\u20137)\n\n\nScholars dispute concerning the degree to which Aristotle regards\nhimself as beholden to the credible opinions (endoxa) he\nrecounts and the basic appearances (phainomena) to which\n he\n appeals.[6] \n Of course, since the endoxa will sometimes conflict with one\nanother, often precisely because the phainomena generate\naporiai, or puzzles, it is not always possible to respect them\nin their entirety. So, as a group they must be re-interpreted and\nsystematized, and, where that does not suffice, some must be rejected\noutright. It is in any case abundantly clear that Aristotle is\nwilling to abandon some or all of the endoxa and\nphainomena whenever science or philosophy demands that he do\nso (Met. 1073b36, 1074b6; PA 644b5; EN\n1145b2\u201330).\n\n\nStill, his attitude towards phainomena does betray a\npreference to conserve as many appearances as is practicable in a given\ndomain\u2014not because the appearances are unassailably accurate, but\nrather because, as he supposes, appearances tend to track the\ntruth.   We are outfitted with sense organs and powers of\nmind so structured as to put us into contact with the world and\nthus to provide us with data regarding its basic constituents and\ndivisions. While our faculties are not infallible, neither are\nthey systematically deceptive or misdirecting. Since\nphilosophy\u2019s aim is truth and much of what appears to us proves\nupon analysis to be correct, phainomena provide both an\nimpetus to philosophize and a check on some of its more extravagant\nimpulses. \n\n\nOf course, it is not always clear what constitutes a\nphainomenon; still less is it clear which phainomenon\nis to be respected in the face of bona fide\ndisagreement. This is in part why Aristotle endorses his second\nand related methodological precept, that we ought to begin\nphilosophical discussions by collecting the most stable and entrenched\nopinions regarding the topic of inquiry handed down to us by our\npredecessors. Aristotle\u2019s term for these privileged views,\nendoxa, is variously rendered as \u2018reputable\nopinions\u2019, \u2018credible opinions\u2019, \u2018entrenched\nbeliefs\u2019, \u2018credible beliefs\u2019, or \u2018common\nbeliefs\u2019.  Each of these translations captures at least part of\nwhat Aristotle intends with this word, but it is important to\nappreciate that it is a fairly technical term for\nhim. An endoxon is the sort of opinion we spontaneously\nregard as reputable or worthy of respect, even if upon reflection we\nmay come to question its veracity. (Aristotle appropriates this term\nfrom ordinary Greek, in which an endoxos is a notable or\nhonourable man, a man of high repute whom we would spontaneously\nrespect\u2014though we might, of course, upon closer inspection, find\ncause to criticize him.)  As he explains his use of the\nterm, endoxa are widely shared opinions, often ultimately\nissuing from those we esteem most: \u2018Endoxa are those\nopinions accepted by everyone, or by the majority, or by the\nwise\u2014and among the wise, by all or most of them, or by those who\nare the most notable and having the highest reputation\u2019\n(Top. 100b21\u201323). Endoxa play a special role\nin Aristotelian philosophy in part because they form a significant\nsub-class of phainomena (EN 1154b3\u20138): because they\nare the privileged opinions we find ourselves unreflectively endorsing\nand reaffirming after some reflection, they themselves come to qualify\nas appearances to be preserved where possible.\n\n\nFor this reason, Aristotle\u2019s method of beginning with the\nendoxa is more than a pious platitude to the effect that it\nbehooves us to mind our superiors. He does think this, as far as\nit goes, but he also maintains, more instructively, that we can be led\nastray by the terms within which philosophical problems are bequeathed\nto us. Very often, the puzzles confronting us were given crisp\nformulations by earlier thinkers and we find them puzzling precisely\nfor that reason. Equally often, however, if we reflect upon the\nterms within which the puzzles are cast, we find a way forward; when a\nformulation of a puzzle betrays an untenable structuring assumption, a\nsolution naturally commends itself. This is why in more abstract\ndomains of inquiry we are likely to find ourselves seeking guidance\nfrom our predecessors even as we call into question their\nways of articulating the problems we are confronting.  \n\n\nAristotle applies his method of running through the\nphainomena and collecting the endoxa widely, in\nnearly every area of his philosophy. To take a typical\nillustration, we find the method clearly deployed in his discussion of\ntime in Physics iv 10\u201314. We begin with a\nphainomenon: we feel sure that time exists\nor at least that time passes. So much is, inescapably,\nhow our world appears: we experience time as passing, as\nunidirectional, as unrecoverable when lost. Yet when we move to\noffer an account of what time might be, we find ourselves\nflummoxed. For guidance, we turn to what has been said about time\nby those who have reflected upon its nature. It emerges directly\nthat both philosophers and natural scientists have raised problems\nabout time. \n\n\nAs Aristotle sets them out, these problems take the form of puzzles,\nor aporiai, regarding whether and if so how time exists\n(Phys. 218a8\u201330). If we say that time is the totality of the\npast, present and future, we immediately find someone objecting that\ntime exists but that the past and future do not. According to the\nobjector, only the present exists. If we retort then that time is\nwhat did exist, what exists at present and\nwhat will exist, then we notice first that our account is\ninsufficient: after all, there are many things which did, do, or will\nexist, but these are things that are in time and so not the\nsame as time itself. We further see that our account already threatens\ncircularity, since to say that something did or will\nexist seems only to say that it existed at an earlier time or\nwill come to exist at a later time. Then again we find\nsomeone objecting to our account that even the notion of the\npresent is troubling. After all, either the present is\nconstantly changing or it remains forever the same. If it remains\nforever the same, then the current present is the same as the present\nof 10,000 years ago; yet that is absurd. If it is constantly changing,\nthen no two presents are the same, in which case a past present must\nhave come into and out of existence before the present present. When?\nEither it went out of existence even as it came into existence, which\nseems odd to say the least, or it went out of existence at some\ninstant after it came into existence, in which case, again, two\npresents must have existed at the same instant. Now, Aristotle does\nnot endorse the claims set out in stating these sorts\nof aporiai; in fact, very often he cannot, because\nsome aporiai qualify as aporiai just because they\ncomprise individually plausible arguments generating incompatible\nconclusions.  They thus serve as springboards to deeper, more\ndemanding analysis. \n\n\nIn general, then, in setting such aporiai, Aristotle does not\nmean to endorse any given endoxon on one side or the\nother. Rather, he thinks that such considerations present credible\npuzzles, reflection upon which may steer us towards a defensible\nunderstanding of the nature of time. In this way, aporiai\nbring into sharp relief the issues requiring attention if progress is\nto be made. Thus, by reflecting upon the aporiai regarding\ntime, we are led immediately to think about duration and divisibility,\nabout\nquanta and continua, and about a variety of\ncategorial questions. That is, if time exists, then what sort of\nthing is it?  Is it the sort of thing which exists absolutely and\nindependently?  Or is it rather the sort of thing which, like a\nsurface, depends upon other things for its existence?  When we\nbegin to address these sorts of questions, we also begin to ascertain\nthe sorts of assumptions at play in the endoxa coming down to\nus regarding the nature of time.   Consequently, when we\ncollect the endoxa and survey them critically, we learn\nsomething about our quarry, in this case about the nature of\ntime\u2014and crucially also something about the constellation of\nconcepts which must be refined if we are to make genuine philosophical\nprogress with respect to it. What holds in the case of time, Aristotle implies, holds generally. This is why he\ncharacteristically begins a philosophical inquiry by presenting the\nphainomena, collecting the endoxa, and running\nthrough the puzzles to which they give rise. \n4. Logic, Science, and Dialectic\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s reliance on endoxa takes on a still greater\nsignificance given the role such opinions play in dialectic,\nwhich he regards as an important form of non-scientific\nreasoning. Dialectic, like science\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea), trades in logical inference; but\nscience requires premises of a sort beyond the scope of ordinary\ndialectical reasoning. Whereas science relies upon premises which\nare necessary and known to be so, a dialectical discussion can proceed\nby relying on endoxa, and so can claim only to be as secure as\nthe endoxa upon which it relies. This is not a problem,\nsuggests Aristotle, since we often reason fruitfully and well in\ncircumstances where we cannot claim to have attained scientific\nunderstanding.   Minimally, however, all\nreasoning\u2014whether scientific or dialectical\u2014must respect\nthe canons of logic and inference. \n4.1 Logic\n\n\n           \nAmong the great achievements to which Aristotle can lay claim is the\nfirst systematic treatment of the principles of correct reasoning, the\nfirst logic. Although today we recognize many forms of logic\nbeyond Aristotle\u2019s, it remains true that he not only developed a\ntheory of deduction, now called syllogistic, but added to it a modal\nsyllogistic and went a long way towards proving some meta-theorems\npertinent to these systems. Of course, philosophers before\nAristotle reasoned well or reasoned poorly, and the competent among them\nhad a secure working grasp of the principles of validity and\nsoundness in argumentation. No-one before Aristotle, however, developed a\nsystematic treatment of the principles governing correct inference; and\nno-one before him attempted to codify the formal and syntactic\nprinciples at play in such inference. Aristotle somewhat\nuncharacteristically draws attention to this fact at the end of a\ndiscussion of logic inference and fallacy:\n\n\nOnce you have surveyed our work, if it seems to you that our system\nhas developed adequately in comparison with other treatments arising\nfrom the tradition to date\u2014bearing in mind how things were at the\nbeginning of our inquiry\u2014it falls to you, our students, to be\nindulgent with respect to any omissions in our system, and to feel a\ngreat debt of gratitude for the discoveries it contains (Soph.\nRef. 184b2\u20138).\n\n\nEven if we now regard it as commonplace that his logic is but a\nfraction of the logic we know and use, Aristotle\u2019s accomplishment\nwas so encompassing that no less a figure than Kant, writing over two\nmillennia after the appearance of Aristotle\u2019s treatises on logic,\nfound it easy to offer an appropriately laudatory judgment: \u2018That\nfrom the earliest times logic has traveled a secure course can be seen\nfrom the fact that since the time of Aristotle it has not had to go a\nsingle step backwards\u2026What is further remarkable about logic is\nthat until now it has also been unable to take a single step forward,\nand therefore seems to all appearance to  be finished and\ncomplete\u2019 (Critique of Pure Reason B vii).\n\n\n           \nIn Aristotle\u2019s logic, the basic ingredients of reasoning are\ngiven in terms of inclusion and exclusion relations,\nof the sort graphically captured many years later by the device of Venn\ndiagrams. He begins with the notion of a patently correct sort of\nargument, one whose evident and unassailable acceptability induces\nAristotle to refer to is as a \u2018perfect deduction\u2019\n(APr. 24b22\u201325). Generally, a deduction\n(sullogismon), according to Aristotle, is a valid or\nacceptable argument. More exactly, a deduction is \u2018an\nargument in which when certain things are laid down something else\nfollows of necessity in virtue of their being so\u2019 (APr.\n24b18\u201320). His view of deductions is, then, akin to a notion of\nvalidity, though there are some minor differences.   For\nexample, Aristotle maintains that irrelevant premises will ruin a\ndeduction, whereas validity is indifferent to irrelevance or indeed to\nthe addition of premises of any kind to an already valid\nargument. Moreover, Aristotle insists that deductions make\nprogress, whereas every inference from p to p is\ntrivially valid. Still, Aristotle\u2019s general conception of\ndeduction is sufficiently close to validity that we may pass into\nspeaking in terms of valid structures when characterizing his\nsyllogistic. In general, he contends that a deduction is the sort\nof argument whose structure guarantees its validity,\nirrespective of the truth or falsity of its premises. This holds\nintuitively for the following structure:\n\nAll As are Bs.\nAll Bs are Cs.\nHence, all As are Cs.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, anything taking this form will be a deduction in\nAristotle\u2019s sense. Let the As,\nBs, and Cs be anything at all, and\nif indeed the As are Bs, and\nthe Bs Cs, then of necessity\nthe As will be Cs.   This\nparticular deduction is perfect because its validity needs no\nproof, and perhaps because it admits of no proof either: any proof\nwould seem to rely ultimately upon the intuitive validity of this sort\nof argument. \n\n\nAristotle seeks to exploit the intuitive validity of perfect\ndeductions in a surprisingly bold way, given the infancy of his\nsubject: he thinks he can establish principles of transformation in\nterms of which every deduction (or, more precisely, every\nnon-modal deduction) can be translated into a perfect deduction. He\ncontends that by using such transformations we can place all\ndeduction on a firm footing.\n\n\nIf we focus on just the simplest kinds of deduction,\nAristotle\u2019s procedure comes quickly into view.   The\nperfect deduction already presented is an instance of universal\naffirmation: all As are Bs; all\nBs Cs; and so, all\nAs are Cs. Now, contends\nAristotle, it is possible to run through all combinations of simple\npremises and display their basic inferential structures and then to\nrelate them back to this and similarly perfect deductions. Thus,\nif we vary the quantity of a proposition\u2019s subject\n(universal all versus indeterminate some) along with\nthe quality or kind of the predication (positive\nversus negative), we arrive at all the possible combinations\nof the most basic kind of arguments.\n\n\nIt turns out that some of these arguments are deductions, or valid\nsyllogisms, and some are not. Those which are not admit of\ncounterexamples, whereas those which are, of course, do not. There are\ncounterexamples to those, for instance, suffering from what came to be\ncalled undistributed middle terms, e.g.: all As\nare Bs; some\nBs are Cs; so, all\nAs are Cs (all university students are literate;\nsome literate people read poetry; so, all university students read\npoetry). There is no counterexample to the perfect deduction in the\nform of a universal affirmation: if all\nAs are Bs, and all\nBs Cs, then there is no escaping the fact that\nall As are Cs. So, if all the kinds of deductions\npossible can be reduced to the intuitively valid sorts, then the\nvalidity of all can be vouchsafed. \n\n\nTo effect this sort of reduction, Aristotle relies upon a series of\nmeta-theorems, some of which he proves and others of which he merely\nreports (though it turns out that they do all indeed admit of\nproofs). His principles are meta-theorems in the sense\nthat no argument can run afoul of them and still qualify as a genuine\ndeduction. They include such theorems as: (i) no deduction\ncontains two negative premises; (ii) a deduction with a negative\nconclusion must have a negative premise; (iii) a deduction with a\nuniversal conclusion requires two universal premises; and (iv) a\ndeduction with a negative conclusion requires exactly one negative\npremise. He does, in fact, offer proofs for the most significant of his\nmeta-theorems, so that we can be assured that all deductions in his\nsystem are valid, even when their validity is difficult to grasp\nimmediately.\n\n\nIn developing and proving these meta-theorems of logic, Aristotle\ncharts territory left unexplored before him and unimproved for many\ncenturies after his death.   \n\n\nFor a fuller account of Aristotle\u2019s achievements in logic,\n see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Logic.\n4.2  Science\n\n           \nAristotle approaches the study of logic not as an end in itself, but\nwith a view to its role in human inquiry and explanation. Logic is a\ntool, he thinks, one making an important but incomplete contribution\nto science and dialectic. Its contribution is incomplete because\nscience (epist\u00eam\u00ea) employs arguments which are\nmore than mere deductions. A deduction is minimally a valid syllogism,\nand certainly science must employ arguments passing this\nthreshold. Still, science needs more: a science proceeds\nby organizing the data in its domain into a series of\narguments which, beyond being deductions, feature premises which are\nnecessary and, as Aristotle says, \u201cbetter known by\nnature\u201d, or \u201cmore intelligible by nature\u201d\n(gn\u00f4rim\u00f4teron phusei)\n(APo. 71b33\u201372a25; Top. 141b3\u201314;\nPhys. 184a16\u201323). By this he means that they should\nreveal the genuine, mind-independent natures of things. \n\n\nHe further insists that science\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea)\u2014a comparatively broad term in\nhis usage, since it extends to fields of inquiry like mathematics and\nmetaphysics no less than the empirical sciences\u2014not only reports\nthe facts but also explains them by displaying their priority\nrelations (APo. 78a22\u201328). That is, science explains what is\nless well known by what is better known and more fundamental, and what\nis explanatorily anemic by what is explanatorily fruitful. \n\n\nWe may, for instance, wish to know why trees lose their leaves in the\nautumn. We may say, rightly, that this is due to the wind blowing\nthrough them. Still, this is not a deep or general explanation, since\nthe wind blows equally at other times of year without the same\nresult. A deeper explanation\u2014one unavailable to Aristotle but\nillustrating his view nicely\u2014is more general, and also more\ncausal in character: trees shed their leaves because diminished\nsunlight in the autumn inhibits the production of chlorophyll, which\nis required for photosynthesis, and without photosynthesis trees go\ndormant.  Importantly, science should not only record these facts but\nalso display them in their correct explanatory order. That is,\nalthough a deciduous tree which fails to photosynthesize is also a\ntree lacking in chlorophyll production, its failing to produce\nchlorophyll explains its inability to photosynthesize and not the\nother way around.  This sort of asymmetry must be captured in\nscientific explanation. Aristotle\u2019s method of scientific exposition is\ndesigned precisely to discharge this requirement.\n\n\nScience seeks to capture not only the causal priorities in nature,\nbut also its deep, invariant patterns. Consequently, in addition\nto being explanatorily basic, the first premise in a scientific\ndeduction will be necessary. So, says Aristotle:\n\n\nWe think we understand a thing without qualification, and not in the\nsophistic, accidental way, whenever we think we know the cause in\nvirtue of which something is\u2014that it is the cause of that very\nthing\u2014and also know that this cannot be otherwise. \nClearly, knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) is something of this\nsort. After all, both those with knowledge and those without it\nsuppose that this is so\u2014although only those with knowledge are\nactually in this condition. Hence, whatever is known without\nqualification cannot be otherwise. (APo 71b9\u201316; cf.\nAPo 71b33\u201372a5; Top. 141b3\u201314, Phys.\n184a10\u201323; Met. 1029b3\u201313) \n\n\nFor this reason, science requires more than mere deduction.\nAltogether, then, the currency of science is demonstration\n(apodeixis), where a demonstration is a deduction with\npremises revealing the causal structures of the world, set forth so as\nto capture what is necessary and to reveal what is better known and\nmore intelligible by nature (APo\n71b33\u201372a5, Phys. 184a16\u201323, EN 1095b2\u20134). \n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s approach to the appropriate form of scientific explanation\ninvites reflection upon a troubling epistemological question: how does\ndemonstration begin? If we are to lay out demonstrations such that the\nless well known is inferred by means of deduction from the better\nknown, then unless we reach rock-bottom, we will evidently be forced\neither to continue ever backwards towards the increasingly better\nknown, which seems implausibly endless, or lapse into some form of\ncircularity, which seems undesirable.  The alternative seems to be\npermanent ignorance.  Aristotle contends:\n\n\nSome people think that since knowledge obtained via demonstration\nrequires the knowledge of primary things, there is no knowledge. \nOthers think that there is knowledge and that all knowledge is\ndemonstrable. Neither of these views is either true or\nnecessary.   The first group, those supposing that there is\nno knowledge at all, contend that we are confronted with an infinite\nregress. They contend that we cannot know posterior things\nbecause of prior things if none of the prior things is primary. \nHere what they contend is correct: it is indeed impossible to traverse\nan infinite series. Yet, they maintain, if the regress comes to a\nhalt, and there are first principles, they will be unknowable, since\nsurely there will be no demonstration of first principles\u2014given,\nas they maintain, that only what is demonstrated can be known. \nBut if it is not possible to know the primary things, then neither can\nwe know without qualification or in any proper way the things derived\nfrom them. Rather, we can know them instead only on the basis of\na hypothesis, to wit, if the primary things obtain, then so\ntoo do the things derived from them. The other group agrees that\nknowledge results only from demonstration, but believes that nothing\nstands in the way of demonstration, since they admit circular and\nreciprocal demonstration as possible. (APo. 72b5\u201321)\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s own preferred alternative is clear:\n\n\nWe contend that not all knowledge is demonstrative: knowledge of the\nimmediate premises is indemonstrable. Indeed, the necessity here\nis apparent; for if it is necessary to know the prior things, that is,\nthose things from which the demonstration is derived, and if eventually\nthe regress comes to a standstill, it is necessary that these immediate\npremises be indemonstrable. (APo. 72b21\u201323)\n\n\nIn sum, if all knowledge requires demonstration, and all\ndemonstration proceeds from what is more intelligible by nature to what\nis less so, then either the process goes on indefinitely or it comes to\na halt in undemonstrated first principles, which are known, and known\nsecurely. Aristotle dismisses the only remaining possibility,\nthat demonstration might be circular, rather curtly, with the remark\nthat this amounts to  \u2018simply saying that something is the\ncase if it is the case,\u2019 by which device \u2018it is easy to\nprove anything\u2019 (APo. 72b32\u201373a6).\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s own preferred alternative, that there are first\nprinciples of the sciences graspable by those willing to engage in\nassiduous study, has caused consternation in many of his readers.\n  In Posterior Analytics ii 19, he describes the\nprocess by which knowers move from perception to memory, and from memory\nto experience (empeiria)\u2014which is a fairly technical\nterm in this connection, reflecting the point at which a single\nuniversal comes to take root in the mind\u2014and finally from\nexperience to a grasp of first principles.   This final\nintellectual state Aristotle characterizes as a kind of unmediated\nintellectual apprehension (nous) of first principles\n(APo. 100a10\u2013b6).\n\nScholars have understandably queried what seems a casually asserted\npassage from the contingent, given in sense experience, to the\nnecessary, as required for the first principles of science. Perhaps,\nhowever, Aristotle simply envisages a kind of a posteriori\nnecessity for the sciences, including the natural sciences. In any\nevent, he thinks that we can and do have knowledge, so that somehow we\nbegin in sense perception and build up to an understanding of the\nnecessary and invariant features of the world. This is the knowledge\nfeatured in genuine science (epist\u00eam\u00ea). In\nreflecting on the sort of progression Aristotle envisages, some\ncommentators have charged him with an epistemological optimism\nbordering on the na\u00efve; others contend that it is rather the\ncharge of na\u00efvet\u00e9 which is itself na\u00efve, betraying as\nit does an unargued and untenable alignment of the necessary and\nthe a\n priori.[7]\n4.3 Dialectic\n\n\n           \nNot all rigorous reasoning qualifies as scientific. Indeed,\nlittle of Aristotle\u2019s extant writing conforms to the demands for\nscientific presentation laid down in the Posterior\nAnalytics. As he recognizes, we often find ourselves\nreasoning from premises which have the status of endoxa,\nopinions widely believed or endorsed by the wise, even though they are\nnot known to be necessary. Still less often do we reason having\nfirst secured the first principles of our domain of inquiry. So,\nwe need some \u2018method by which we will be able to reason\ndeductively about any matter proposed to us on the basis of\nendoxa, and to give an account of ourselves [when we are under\nexamination by an interlocutor] without lapsing into\ncontradiction\u2019 (Top. 100a18\u201320).   This method\nhe characterizes as dialectic. \n\n\n           \nThe suggestion that we often use dialectic when engaged in\nphilosophical exchange reflects Aristotle\u2019s supposition that\nthere are two sorts of dialectic: one negative, or destructive, and the\nother positive, or constructive. In fact, in his work dedicated\nto dialectic, the Topics, he identifies three roles for\ndialectic in intellectual inquiry, the first of which is mainly\npreparatory:\n\n\nDialectic is useful for three purposes: for training, for\nconversational exchange, and for sciences of a philosophical\nsort. That it is useful for training purposes is directly evident\non the basis of these considerations: once we have a direction for our\ninquiry we will more readily be able to engage a subject proposed to\nus. It is useful for conversational exchange because once we have\nenumerated the beliefs of the many, we shall engage them not on the\nbasis of the convictions of others but on the basis of their own; and\nwe shall re-orient them whenever they appear to have said something\nincorrect to us. It is useful for philosophical sorts of sciences\nbecause when we are able to run through the puzzles on both sides of an\nissue we more readily perceive what is true and what is false. \nFurther, it is useful for uncovering what is primary among the\ncommitments of a science. For it is impossible to say anything\nregarding the first principles of a science on the basis of the first\nprinciples proper to the very science under discussion, since among all\nthe commitments of a science, the first principles are the primary\nones. This comes rather, necessarily, from discussion of the\ncredible beliefs (endoxa) belonging to the science. This\nis peculiar to dialectic, or is at least most proper to it. For\nsince it is what cross-examines, dialectic contains the way to the\nfirst principles of all inquiries. (Top. 101a26\u2013b4)\n\n\nThe first two of the three forms of dialectic identified by Aristotle\nare rather limited in scope. By contrast, the third is philosophically\nsignificant.\n\n\n           \nIn its third guise, dialectic has a role to play in \u2018science\nconducted in a philosophical manner\u2019 (pros tas kata\nphilosphian epist\u00eamas; Top. 101a27\u201328, 101a34),\nwhere this sort of science includes what we actually find him pursuing\nin his major philosophical treatises. In these contexts,\ndialectic helps to sort the endoxa, relegating some to a\ndisputed status while elevating others; it submits endoxa to\ncross-examination in order to test their staying power; and, most\nnotably, according to Aristotle, dialectic puts us on the road to first\nprinciples (Top. 100a18\u2013b4). If that is so, then\ndialectic plays a significant role in the order of philosophical\ndiscovery: we come to establish first principles in part by determining\nwhich among our initial endoxa withstand sustained\nscrutiny. Here, as elsewhere in his philosophy, Aristotle evinces\na noteworthy confidence in the powers of human reason and\ninvestigation.\n5. Essentialism and Homonymy\n\n           \nHowever we arrive at secure principles in philosophy and science,\nwhether by some process leading to a rational grasping of necessary\ntruths, or by sustained dialectical investigation operating over\njudiciously selected endoxa, it does turn out, according to\nAristotle, that we can uncover and come to know genuinely necessary\nfeatures of reality. Such features, suggests Aristotle, are those\ncaptured in the essence-specifying definitions used in science (again\nin the broad sense of epist\u00eam\u00ea). \n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s commitment to essentialism runs deep.   He\nrelies upon a host of loosely related locutions when discussing the\nessences of things, and these give some clue to his general\norientation. Among the locutions one finds rendered as\nessence in contemporary translations of Aristotle into English\nare: (i) to ti esti (the what it is); (ii) to einai\n(being); (iii) ousia (being); (iv) hoper esti (precisely\nwhat something is) and, most importantly, (v) to ti \u00ean\neinai (the what it was to be) (APo 83a7; Top.\n141b35; Phys. 190a17, 201a18\u201321; Gen. et Corr. 319b4;\nDA 424a25, 429b10; Met. 1003b24, 1006a32, 1006b13;\nEN 1102a30, 1130a12\u201313). Among these, the last locution\n(v) requires explication both because it is the most peculiar and\nbecause it is Aristotle\u2019s favored technical term for\nessence. It is an abbreviated way of saying \u2018that which it\nwas for an instance of kind K to be an instance of kind\nK,\u2019 for instance \u2018that which it was (all along)\nfor a human being to be a human being\u2019. In speaking this\nway, Aristotle supposes that if we wish to know what a human being is,\nwe cannot identify transient or non-universal features of that kind;\nnor indeed can we identify even universal features which do not run\nexplanatorily deep. Rather, as his preferred locution indicates,\nhe is interested in what makes a human being human\u2014and he\nassumes, first, that there is some feature F which all and only humans\nhave in common and, second, that F explains the other features which we\nfind across the range of humans. \n\n\n           \nImportantly, this second feature of Aristotelian essentialism\ndifferentiates his approach from the now more common modal approach,\naccording to\n which:[8]\n\nF is an essential property of\nx =df if x loses F,\nthen x ceases to exist.\n\n\n\n\nAristotle rejects this approach for several reasons, including most\nnotably that he thinks that certain non-essential features satisfy the\ndefinition. Thus, beyond the categorical and logical features\n(everyone is such as to be either identical or not identical with the\nnumber nine), Aristotle recognizes a category of properties which he\ncalls idia (Cat. 3a21, 4a10; Top. 102a18\u201330,\n134a5\u2013135b6), now usually known by their Medieval Latin rendering\npropria. Propria are non-essential properties which flow\nfrom the essence of a kind, such that they are necessary to that kind\neven without being essential. For instance, if we suppose that\nbeing rational is essential to human beings, then it will\nfollow that every human being is capable of grammar. \nBeing capable of grammar is not the same property as being rational,\nthough it follows from it. Aristotle assumes his readers will\nappreciate that being rational asymmetrically explains\nbeing capable of grammar, even though, necessarily, something\nis rational if and only if it is also capable of grammar. Thus,\nbecause it is explanatorily prior, being rational has a better\nclaim to being the essence of human beings than does being capable\nof grammar.   Consequently, Aristotle\u2019s\nessentialism is more fine-grained than mere modal essentialism. \nAristotelian essentialism holds:\n\nF is an essential property of x =df (i) if\nx loses F, then x ceases to exist; and\n(ii) F is in an objective sense an explanatorily basic\nfeature of x.\n\n\n\n\n In sum, in Aristotle\u2019s approach, what it is to be, for\ninstance, a human being is just what it always has been and always will\nbe, namely being rational.   Accordingly, this is\nthe feature to be captured in an essence-specifying account of human\nbeings (APo 75a42\u2013b2; Met. 103b1\u20132, 1041a25\u201332).\n\n\n           \nAristotle believes for a broad range of cases that kinds have essences\ndiscoverable by diligent research. He in fact does not devote\nmuch energy to arguing for this contention; still less is he inclined\nto expend energy combating anti-realist challenges to essentialism,\nperhaps in part because he is impressed by the deep regularities he\nfinds, or thinks he finds, underwriting his results in biological\n investigation.[9] \n Still, he cannot be accused of profligacy regarding the prospects\nof essentialism. \n\n\nOn the contrary, he denies essentialism in many cases where others\nare prepared to embrace it. One finds this sort of denial\nprominently, though not exclusively, in his criticism of Plato. \nIndeed, it becomes a signature criticism of Plato and Platonists for\nAristotle that many of their preferred examples of sameness and\ninvariance in the world are actually cases of multivocity, or\nhomonymy in his technical terminology. In the opening of the\nCategories, Aristotle distinguishes between synonymy\nand homonymy  (later called univocity and\nmultivocity). His preferred phrase for multivocity,\nwhich is extremely common in his writings, is  \u2018being spoken\nof in many ways\u2019, or, more simply, \u2018multiply meant\u2019\n(pollach\u00f4s legomenon). All these locutions have a\nquasi-technical status for him. The least complex is\nunivocity:\n\na and b are univocally F iff (i)\na is F, (ii) b is F, and (iii) the\naccounts of\nF-ness in \u2018a is F\u2019 and\n\u2018b is F\u2019 are the same.\n\n\n\n\nThus, for instance, since the accounts of \u2018human\u2019 in\n\u2018Socrates is human\u2019 and \u2018Plato is human\u2019 will\nbe the same, \u2018human\u2019 is univocal or synonymous in these\napplications. (Note that Aristotle\u2019s notion of the word \u2018synonymy\u2019 is\nnot the same as the contemporary English usage where it applies to\ndifferent words with the same meaning.)  In cases of\nunivocity, we expect single, non-disjunctive definitions which capture\nand state the essence of the kinds in question. Let us allow once\nmore for purposes of illustration that the essence-specifying\ndefinition of human is rational animal. Then,\nsince human means rational animal across the range of\nits applications, there is some single essence to all members of the\nkind.\n\n\n           \nBy contrast, when synonymy fails we have homonymy. According to\nAristotle:\n\na and b are homonymously F iff (i)\na is F, (ii) b is F, (iii) the\naccounts of F-ness in \u2018a is F\u2019\nand \u2018b is F\u2019 do not completely\noverlap.\n\n\n\n\nTo take an easy example without philosophical significance,\nbank is homonymous in \u2018Socrates and Alcibiades had a\npicnic on the bank\u2019 and \u2018Socrates and Alcibiades opened a\njoint account at the bank.\u2019  This case is illustrative, if\nuninteresting, because the accounts of bank in these\noccurrences have nothing whatsoever in common. Part of the philosophical \ninterest in Aristotle\u2019s account of homonymy resides in its\nallowing partial overlap. Matters become more interesting if we\nexamine whether\u2014to use an illustration well suited to\nAristotle\u2019s purposes but left largely unexplored by\nhim\u2014conscious is synonymous across \u2018Charlene was\nconscious of some awkwardness created by her remarks\u2019 and\n\u2018Higher vertebrates, unlike mollusks, are conscious.\u2019 \nIn these instances, the situation with respect to synonymy or homonymy\nis perhaps not immediately clear, and so requires reflection and\nphilosophical investigation. \n\n\n           \nVery regularly, according to Aristotle, this sort of reflection leads\nto an interesting discovery, namely that we have been presuming a\nunivocal account where in fact none is forthcoming. This,\naccording to Aristotle, is where the Platonists go wrong: they presume\nunivocity where the world delivers homonymy or multivocity. (For\na vivid illustration of Plato\u2019s univocity assumption at work, see\nMeno 71e1\u201372a5, where Socrates insists that there is but one\nkind of excellence (aret\u00ea) common to all kinds\nof excellent people, not a separate sort for men, women, slaves,\nchildren, and so on.)  In one especially important example,\nAristotle parts company with Plato over the univocity of goodness:\n\n\nWe had perhaps better consider the universal good and run through\nthe puzzles concerning what is meant by it\u2014even though this sort\nof investigation is unwelcome to us, because those who introduced the\nForms are friends of ours. Yet presumably it would be the better\ncourse to destroy even what is close to us, as something necessary for\npreserving the truth\u2014and all the more so, given that we are\nphilosophers. For though we love them both, piety bids us to\nhonour the truth before our friends. (EN\n1096a11\u201316)  \n\n\nAristotle counters that Plato is wrong to assume that goodness is\n\u2018something universal, common to all good things, and\nsingle\u2019 (EN 1096a28). Rather, goodness is different in\ndifferent cases. If he is right about this, far-reaching consequences\nregarding ethical theory and practice follow.\n\n\n           \nTo establish non-univocity, Aristotle\u2019s appeals to a variety of\ntests in his Topics where, again, his idiom is linguistic but\nhis quarry is metaphysical. Consider the following sentences:\n\nSocrates is good.\nCommunism is good.\nAfter a light meal, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is good.\nRedoubling one\u2019s effort after failure is always good.\nMaria\u2019s singing is good, but Renata\u2019s is sublime.\n\n\n\nAmong the tests for non-univocity recommended in the Topics\nis a simple paraphrase test: if paraphrases yield distinct,\nnon-interchangeable accounts, then the predicate is\nmultivocal.   So, for example, suitable paraphrases might\nbe:\n\nSocrates is a virtuous\nperson.\nCommunism is a just social\nsystem.\nAfter a light meal,\ncr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is tasty and satisfying.\nTrying harder after one has\nfailed is always edifying.\nMaria\u2019s singing\nreaches a high artistic standard, but Renata\u2019s\nsurpasses that standard by any measure.\n\n\n\nSince we cannot interchange these paraphrases\u2014we cannot say,\nfor instance, that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a just social\nsystem\u2014good must be non-univocal across this range of\napplications. If that is correct, then Platonists are wrong to\nassume univocity in this case, since goodness exhibits complexity\nignored by their assumption.\n\n\n           \nSo far, then, Aristotle\u2019s appeals to homonymy or multivocity are\nprimarily destructive, in the sense that they attempt to undermine a\nPlatonic presumption regarded by Aristotle as unsustainable. \nImportantly, just as Aristotle sees a positive as well as a negative\nrole for dialectic in philosophy, so he envisages in addition to its\ndestructive applications a philosophically constructive role for\nhomonymy. To appreciate his basic idea, it serves to reflect upon a\ncontinuum of positions in philosophical analysis ranging from pure\nPlatonic univocity to disaggregated Wittgensteinean family\nresemblance. One might in the face of a successful challenge to\nPlatonic univocity assume that, for instance, the various cases of\ngoodness have nothing in common across all cases, so that good things\nform at best a motley kind, of the sort championed by Wittgensteineans\nenamored of the metaphor of family resemblances: all good things belong\nto a kind only in the limited sense that they manifest a tapestry of\npartially overlapping properties, as every member of a single family is\nunmistakably a member of that family even though there is no one\nphysical attribute shared by all of those family members. \n\n\n           \nAristotle insists that there is a tertium quid between family\nresemblance and pure univocity: he identifies, and trumpets, a kind of\ncore-dependent homonymy (also referred to in the literature,\nwith varying degrees of accuracy, as focal meaning and\nfocal\n connexion).[10] \n Core-dependent homonyms exhibit a kind\nof order in multiplicity: although shy of univocity, because\nhomonymous, such concepts do not devolve into patchwork family\nresemblances either. To rely upon one of Aristotle\u2019s own\nfavorite illustrations, consider:\n\nSocrates is healthy.\nSocrates\u2019 exercise regimen is healthy.\nSocrates\u2019 complexion is healthy.\n\n\n\nAristotle assumes that his readers will immediately appreciate two\nfeatures of these three predications of healthy. First,\nthey are non-univocal, since the second is paraphraseable roughly as\npromotes health and the third as is indicative of\nhealth, whereas the first means, rather, something more\nfundamental, like is sound of body or is functioning\nwell. Hence, healthy is non-univocal. Second,\neven so, the last two predications rely upon the first for their\nelucidations: each appeals to health in its core sense in an\nasymmetrical way. That is, any account of each of the latter two\npredications must allude to the first, whereas an account of\nthe first makes no reference to the second or third in its\naccount. So, suggests Aristotle, health is not only a\nhomonym, but a core-dependent homonym: while not univocal\nneither is it a case of rank multivocity. \n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s illustration does succeed in showing that there is\nconceptual space between mere family resemblance and pure\nunivocity. So, he is right that these are not exhaustive\noptions. The interest in this sort of result resides in its\nexportability to richer, if more abstract philosophical concepts. \nAristotle appeals to homonymy frequently, across a full range of\nphilosophical concepts including justice, causation,\nlove, life, sameness, goodness, and\nbody. His most celebrated appeal to core-dependent homonymy\ncomes in the case of a concept so highly abstract that it is difficult\nto gauge his success without extended metaphysical reflection. This is\nhis appeal to the core-dependent homonymy of being, which has\ninspired both philosophical and scholarly\ncontroversy.[11]\nAristotle denies that there could be a science of being, on the\ngrounds that there is no single genus being under which all\nand only beings fall (SE 11\n172a13\u201315\u201315; APr. 92b14; Met. B 3,\n998b22; EE i 8, 1217b33\u201335). One motivation for his\nreasoning this way may be that he regards the notion of a genus as\n ineliminably taxonomical and contrastive,[12] \n so that it makes ready sense to speak of\na genus of being only if one can equally well speak of a genus of\nnon-being\u2014just as among living beings one can speak of the\nanimals and the non-animals, viz. the plant kingdom. Since there are\nno non-beings, there accordingly can be no genus of non-being, and so,\nultimately, no genus of being either.  Consequently, since each\nscience studies one essential kind arrayed under a single genus, there\ncan be no science of being either.\n\n\n           \nSubsequently, without expressly reversing his judgment about the\nexistence of a science of being, Aristotle announces that there is\nnonetheless a science of being qua being (Met. iv 4),\nfirst philosophy, which takes as its subject matter beings insofar as\nthey are beings and thus considers all and only those features\npertaining to beings as such\u2014to beings, that is, not insofar as\nthey are mathematical or physical or human beings, but insofar as they\nare beings, full stop. Although the matter is disputed, his\nrecognition of this science evidently turns crucially on his commitment\nto the core-dependent homonymy of being\n itself.[13] \n Although the case is not\nas clear and uncontroversial as Aristotle\u2019s relatively easy\nappeal to health (which is why, after all, he selected it as\nan illustration), we are supposed to be able upon reflection to detect\nan analogous core-dependence in the following instances of\nexists:\n\nSocrates exists.\nSocrates\u2019 location exists.\nSocrates\u2019 weighing 73 kilos exists.\nSocrates\u2019 being morose today exists.\n\n\n\nOf course, the last three items on this list are rather awkward\nlocutions, but this is because they strive to make explicit that we can\nspeak of dependent beings as existing if we wish to do so\u2014but\nonly because of their dependence upon the core instance of being,\nnamely substance. (Here it is noteworthy that \u2018primary\nsubstance\u2019 is the conventional and not very happy rendering of\nAristotle\u2019s prot\u00ea ousia in Greek, which\nmeans, more literally, \u2018primary\n being\u2019).[14] \n According to this\napproach, we would not have Socrates\u2019 weighing anything at all or\nfeeling any way today were it not for the prior fact of his\nexistence. So, exists in the first instance serves as\nthe core instance of being, in terms of which the others are to be\nexplicated. If this is correct, then, implies Aristotle,\nbeing is a core-dependent homonym; further, a science of\nbeing\u2014or, rather, a science of being qua\nbeing\u2014becomes possible, even though there is no genus of being,\nsince it is finally possible to study all beings insofar as they are\nrelated to the core instance of being, and then also to study that\ncore instance, namely substance, insofar as it serves as the prime\noccasion of being.\n6. Category Theory\n\n\n           \nIn speaking of beings which depend upon substance for their existence,\nAristotle implicitly appeals to a foundational philosophical commitment\nwhich appears early in his thought and remains stable throughout his\nentire philosophical career: his theory of categories. In what is\nusually regarded as an early work, The Categories, Aristotle\nrather abruptly announces:\n\n\nOf things said without combination, each signifies either: (i) a\nsubstance (ousia); (ii) a quantity; (iii) a quality; (iv) a\nrelative; (v) where; (vi) when; (vii) being in a position; (viii)\nhaving; (ix) acting upon; or (x) a being affected. (Cat.\n1b25\u201327)\n\n\nAristotle does little to frame his theory of categories, offering no\nexplicit derivation of it, nor even specifying overtly what his theory\nof categories categorizes. If librarians categorize books and\nbotanists categorize plants, then what does the philosophical category\ntheorist categorize?  \n\n\n           \nAristotle does not say explicitly, but his examples make reasonably\nclear that he means to categorize the basic kinds of beings there may\nbe. If we again take some clues from linguistic data, without\ninferring that the ultimate objects of categorization are themselves\nlinguistic, we can contrast things said \u201cwith\ncombination\u201d:\n\nMan runs.\n\n\n\nwith things said \u2018without combination\u2019:\n\nMan\nRuns\n\n\n\n\u2018Man runs\u2019 is truth-evaluable, whereas neither \n\u2018man\u2019 nor \u2018runs\u2019 is. Aristotle says that\nthings of this sort signify entities, evidently\nextra-linguistic entities, which are thus, correlatively, in the first\ncase sufficiently complex to be what makes the sentence \u2018Man\nruns\u2019 true, that is a man running, and in the second,\nitems below the level of truth-making, so, e.g., an entity a man,\ntaken by itself, and an action running, taken by itself. \nIf that is correct, the entities categorized by the categories are the\nsorts of basic beings that fall below the level of truth-makers, or\nfacts. Such beings evidently contribute, so to speak, to the\nfacticity of facts, just as, in their linguistic analogues, nouns and\nverbs, things said \u2018without combination\u2019, contribute to the\ntruth-evaluability of simple assertions. The constituents of\nfacts contribute to facts as the semantically relevant parts of a\nproposition contribute to its having the truth conditions it has. \nThus, the items categorized in Aristotle\u2019s categories are the\nconstituents of facts. If it is a fact that Socrates is\npale, then the basic beings in view are Socrates and\nbeing pale.   In Aristotle\u2019s terms, the first\nis a substance and the second is a quality. \n\n\nImportantly, these beings may be basic without being\nabsolutely simple. After all, Socrates is made up of all\nmanner of parts\u2014arms and legs, organs and bones, molecules and\natoms, and so on down. As a useful linguistic analogue, we may\nconsider phonemes, which are basic, relative to the morphemes\nof a linguistic theory, and yet also complex, since they are made up of\nsimpler sound components, which are irrelevant from the\nlinguist\u2019s point of view because of their lying beneath the level\nof semantic relevance. \n\n\n           \nThe theory of categories in total recognizes ten sorts of\nextra-linguistic basic beings:\n\n\nCategory\nIllustration\n\n\nSubstance\nman, horse\n\n\nQuality\nwhite, grammatical\n\n\nQuantity\ntwo-feet long\n\n\nRelative\ndouble, slave\n\n\nPlace\nin the market\n\n\nTime\nyesterday, tomorrow\n\n\nPosition\nlying, sitting\n\n\nHaving\nhas shoes on\n\n\nActing Upon\ncutting, burning\n\n\nBeing Affected\nbeing cut, being burnt\n\n\n\n\nAlthough he does not say so overtly in the Categories,\nAristotle evidently presumes that these ten categories of being are\nboth exhaustive and irreducible, so that while there are no other\nbasic beings, it is not possible to eliminate any one of these\ncategories in favor of another.\n\n\n           \nBoth claims have come in for criticism, and each surely\n requires\n defense.[15]\nAristotle offers neither conviction a defense in his\nCategories. Nor, indeed, does he offer any principled\ngrounding for just these categories of being, a circumstance which has\nleft him open to further criticism from later philosophers, including\nfamously Kant who, after lauding Aristotle for coming up with the idea\nof category theory, proceeds to excoriate him for selecting his\nparticular categories on no principled basis whatsoever. Kant\nalleges that Aristotle picked his categories of being just as he\nhappened to stumble upon them in his reveries (Critique of Pure\nReason, A81/B107).   According to Kant, then,\nAristotle\u2019s categories are ungrounded. \nPhilosophers and scholars both before and after Kant have sought to\nprovide the needed grounding, whereas Aristotle himself mainly tends to\njustify the theory of categories by putting it to work in his various\nphilosophical investigations.\n\n\n           \nWe have already implicitly encountered in passing two of\nAristotle\u2019s appeals to category theory: (i) in his approach to\ntime, which he comes to treat as a non-substantial being; and (ii) in his\ncommitment to the core-dependent homonymy of being, which introduces\nsome rather more contentious considerations. These may be\nrevisited briefly to illustrate how Aristotle thinks that his doctrine\nof categories provides philosophical guidance where it is most\nneeded.\n\n\nThinking first of time and its various puzzles, or aporiai,\nwe saw that Aristotle poses a simple question: does time exist? \nHe answers this question in the affirmative, but only because in the\nend he treats it as a categorically circumscribed question.  \nHe claims that \u2018time is the measure of motion with respect to the\nbefore and after\u2019 (Phys. 219b1\u20132).   By\noffering this definition, Aristotle is able to advance the judgment\nthat time does exist, because it is an entity in the category of\nquantity: time is to motion or change as length is to a line. \nTime thus exists, but like all items in any non-substance category, it\nexists in a dependent sort of way. Just as if there were no lines\nthere would be no length, so if there were no change there would be no\ntime. Now, this feature of Aristotle\u2019s theory of time has\noccasioned both critical and favorable\n reactions.[16] \n In the present context,\nhowever, it is important only that it serves to demonstrate how\nAristotle handles questions of existence: they are, at root, questions\nabout category membership. A question as to whether, e.g.,\nuniversals or places or relations exist, is ultimately, for Aristotle,\nalso a question concerning their category of being, if any.\n\n\n           \nAs time is a dependent entity in Aristotle\u2019s theory, so too are\nall entities in categories outside of substance. This helps\nexplain why Aristotle thinks it appropriate to deploy his apparatus of\ncore-dependent homonymy in the case of being. If we ask\nwhether qualities or quantities exist, Aristotle will answer in the\naffirmative, but then point out also that as dependent entities they do\nnot exist in the independent manner of substances. Thus, even in\nthe relatively rarified case of being, the theory of\ncategories provides a reason for uncovering core-dependent\nhomonymy. Since all other categories of being depend upon\nsubstance, it should be the case that an analysis of any one of them\nwill ultimately make asymmetrical reference to substance. Aristotle\ncontends in his Categories, relying on a distinction that\ntracks essential (said-of) and accidental (in)\npredication, that:\n\n\nAll other things are either said-of primary\nsubstances, which are their subjects, or are in them as\nsubjects. Hence, if there were no primary substances, it would be\nimpossible for anything else to exist. (Cat. 2b5\u20136)\n \n\n\nIf this is so, then, Aristotle infers, all the non-substance\ncategories rely upon substance as the core of their being. So, he\nconcludes, being qualifies as a case of core-dependent homonymy.\n\n\n           \nNow, one may challenge Aristotle\u2019s contentions here, first by\nquerying whether he has established the non-univocity of being\nbefore proceeding to argue for its core-dependence. Be that as it\nmay, if we allow its non-univocity, then, according to Aristotle, the\napparatus of the categories provides ample reason to conclude that\nbeing qualifies as a philosophically significant instance of\ncore-dependent homonymy.\n\n\n           \nIn this way, Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of being and substance, like\nmuch else in his philosophy, relies upon an antecedent commitment to\nhis theory of categories.   Indeed, the theory of categories\nspans his entire career and serves as a kind of scaffolding for much of\nhis philosophical theorizing, ranging from metaphysics and philosophy\nof nature to psychology and value theory. \n\n\n           \nFor this reason, questions regarding the ultimate tenability of\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of categories take on a special urgency for\nevaluating much of his philosophy. \n\n\nFor more detail on the theory of categories and its grounding,\n see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Categories.\n7. The Four Causal Account of Explanatory Adequacy\n\n\n           \nEqually central to Aristotle\u2019s thought is his four-causal\nexplanatory scheme. Judged in terms of its influence, this\ndoctrine is surely one of his most significant philosophical\ncontributions. Like other philosophers, Aristotle expects the\nexplanations he seeks in philosophy and science to meet certain\ncriteria of adequacy. Unlike some other philosophers, however, he\ntakes care to state his criteria for adequacy explicitly; then, having\ndone so, he finds frequent fault with his predecessors for failing to\nmeet its terms. He states his scheme in a methodological passage\nin the second book of his Physics:\n\n\n One way in which cause is spoken of is that out of which a thing\ncomes to be and which persists, e.g. the bronze of the statue, the\nsilver of the bowl, and the genera of which the bronze and the silver\nare species.\n\n In another way cause is spoken of as the form or the pattern, i.e.\nwhat is mentioned in the account (logos) belonging to the\nessence and its genera, e.g. the cause of an octave is a ratio of 2:1,\nor number more generally, as well as the parts mentioned in the account\n(logos).\n\n Further, the primary source of the change and rest is spoken of as a\ncause, e.g. the man who deliberated is a cause, the father is the cause\nof the child, and generally the maker is the cause of what is made and\nwhat brings about change is a cause of what is changed.\n\n Further, the end (telos) is spoken of as a cause. \nThis is that for the sake of which (hou heneka) a\nthing is done, e.g. health is the cause of walking about. \n\u2018Why is he walking about?\u2019  We say: \u2018To be\nhealthy\u2019\u2014and, having said that, we think we have indicated\nthe cause.\n(Phys. 194b23\u201335)\n\n\n\nAlthough some of Aristotle\u2019s illustrations are not immediately\npellucid, his approach to explanation is reasonably\nstraightforward.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s attitude towards explanation is best understood\nfirst by considering a simple example he proposes in Physics\nii 3. A bronze statue admits of various different dimensions of\nexplanation. If we were to confront a statue without first\nrecognizing what it was, we would, thinks Aristotle, spontaneously ask\na series of questions about it. We would wish to know what it\nis, what it is made of, what brought it about,\nandwhat it is for.   In Aristotle\u2019s terms, in\nasking these questions we are seeking knowledge of the statue\u2019s\nfour causes (aitia): the formal, material, efficient,\nand final. According to Aristotle, when we have\nidentified these four causes, we have satisfied a reasonable demand for\nexplanatory adequacy. \n\n\nMore fully, the four-causal account of explanatory adequacy requires\nan investigator to cite these four causes:\n\nThe Four Causes\n\nmaterial\n that from which\nsomething is generated and out of which it is made, e.g. the bronze of\na statue.\n\n\nformal\n the structure which the\nmatter realizes and in terms of which it comes to be something\ndeterminate, e.g., the shape of the president, in virtue of which this\nquantity of bronze is said to be a statue of a president.\n\n\nefficient\n the agent responsible\nfor a quantity of matter\u2019s coming to be informed, e.g. the sculptor who\nshaped the quantity of bronze into its current shape, the shape of the\npresident.\n\n\nfinal\n the purpose or goal of\nthe compound of form and matter, e.g. the statue was created for the\npurpose of honoring the president.\n\n\n\n\nIn Physics ii 3, Aristotle makes twin claims about this\nfour-causal schema: (i) that citing all four causes is\nnecessary for adequacy in explanation; and (ii) that these\nfour causes are sufficient for adequacy in explanation. \nEach of these claims requires some elaboration and also some\nqualification. \n\n\n           \nAs for the necessity claim, Aristotle does not suppose that all\nphenomena admit of all four causes. Thus, for example,\ncoincidences lack final causes, since they do not occur for the sake of\nanything; that is, after all,  what makes them coincidences. \nIf a debtor is on his way to the market to buy milk and she runs into\nher creditor, who is on his way to the same market to buy bread, then\nshe may agree to pay the money owed immediately. Although\nresulting in a wanted outcome, their meeting was not for the sake of\nsettling the debt; nor indeed was it for the sake of anything at\nall. It was a simple co-incidence. Hence, it lacks a final\ncause. Similarly, if we think that there are mathematical or\ngeometrical abstractions, for instance a triangle existing as an object\nof thought independent of any material realization, then the triangle\nwill trivially lack a material\n cause.[17] \n Still, these significant exceptions\naside, Aristotle expects the vast majority of explanations to conform\nto his four-causal schema. In non-exceptional cases, a failure to\nspecify all four of causes, is, he maintains, a failure in explanatory\nadequacy.\n\n\n           \nThe sufficiency claim is exceptionless, though it may yet be misleading\nif one pertinent issue is left unremarked. In providing his\nillustration of the material cause Aristotle first cites the bronze of\na statue and the silver of a bowl, and then mentions also \u2018the\ngenera of which the bronze and the silver are species\u2019\n(Phys. 194b25\u201327). By this he means the types of metal\nto which silver and bronze belong, or more generally still, simply\nmetal. That is, one might specify the material cause of\na statue more or less proximately, by specifying the character of the\nmatter more or less precisely. Hence, when he implies that citing\nall four causes is sufficient for explanation, Aristotle does not\nintend to suggest that a citation at any level of generality\nsuffices. He means to insist rather that there is no fifth kind\nof cause, that his preferred four cases subsume all kinds of\ncause. He does not argue for this conclusion fully, though he\ndoes challenge his readers to identify a kind of cause which qualifies\nas a sort distinct from the four mentioned (Phys.\n195a4\u20135). \n\n\n           \nSo far, then, Aristotle\u2019s four causal schema has whatever\nintuitive plausibility his illustrations may afford it. He does\nnot rest content there, however. Instead, he thinks he can argue\nforcefully for the four causes as real explanatory factors, that is, as\nfeatures which must be cited not merely because they make for\nsatisfying explanations, but because they are genuinely operative\ncausal factors, the omission of which renders any putative explanation\nobjectively incomplete and so inadequate. \n\n\n           \nIt should be noted that Aristotle\u2019s arguments for the four causes\ntaken individually all proceed against the backdrop of the general\nconnection he forges between causal explanation and knowledge. Because\nhe thinks that the four aitia feature in answers to\nknowledge-seeking questions (Phys. 194b18; A Po. 71 b\n9\u201311, 94 a 20), some scholars have come to understand them more as\nbecauses than as causes\u2014that is, as\nexplanations rather than as causes narrowly\n construed.[18] \n Most such judgments\nreflect an antecedent commitment to one or another view of causation\nand explanation\u2014that causation relates events rather than\npropositions; that explanations are inquiry-relative; that causation is\nextensional and explanation intensional; that explanations must adhere\nto some manner of nomic-deductive model, whereas causes need not; or\nthat causes must be prior in time to their effects, while explanations,\nespecially intentional explanations, may appeal to states of affairs\nposterior in time to the actions they explain. \n\n\nGenerally, Aristotle does not respect these sorts of\ncommitments. Thus, to the extent that they are defensible, his\napproach to aitia may be regarded as blurring the canons of\ncausation and explanation. It should certainly not, however, be\nceded up front that Aristotle is guilty of any such conflation, or even\nthat scholars who render his account of the four aitia in\ncausal terms have failed to come to grips with developments in causal\ntheory in the wake of Hume. Rather, because of the lack of\nuniformity in contemporary accounts of causation and explanation, and a\npersistent and justifiable tendency to regard causal explanations as\nfoundational relative to other sorts of explanations, we may\nlegitimately wonder whether Aristotle\u2019s conception of the four\naitia is in any significant way discontinuous with later,\nHumean-inspired approaches, and then again, to the degree that it is,\nwhether Aristotle\u2019s approach suffers for the comparison. Be that\nas it may, we will do well when considering Aristotle\u2019s defense\nof his four aitia to bear in mind that controversy surrounds\nhow best to construe his knowledge-driven approach to causation and\nexplanation relative to some later approaches. \n\n\nFor more on the four causes in general, see the entry on\n Aristotle on Causality.\n8. Hylomorphism\n\n\n           \nCentral to Aristotle\u2019s four-causal account of explanatory\nadequacy are the notions of matter (hul\u00ea) and\nform (eidos or morph\u00ea). Together, they\nconstitute one of his most fundamental philosophical commitments, to\nhylomorphism:\n\nHylomorphism =df\nordinary objects are composites of matter and form. \n\n\n\nThe appeal in this definition to \u2018ordinary objects\u2019\nrequires reflection, but as a first approximation, it serves to rely on\nthe sorts of examples Aristotle himself employs when motivating\nhylomorphism: statues and houses, horses and humans. In general,\nwe may focus on artefacts and familiar living beings. \nHylomorphism holds that no such object is metaphysically simple, but\nrather comprises two distinct metaphysical elements, one formal and one\nmaterial.\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s hylomorphism was formulated originally to handle\nvarious puzzles about change.   Among the endoxa\nconfronting Aristotle in his Physics are some striking\nchallenges to the coherence of the very notion of change, owing to\n Parmenides\n and\n Zeno. \nAristotle\u2019s initial impulse in the face of such challenges, as we\nhave seen, is to preserve the appearances (phainomena), to\nexplain how change is possible. Key to Aristotle\u2019s response\nto the challenges bequeathed him is his insistence that all change\ninvolves at least two factors: something persisting and something\ngained or lost. Thus, when Socrates goes to the beach and comes\naway sun-tanned, something continues to exist, namely Socrates, even\nwhile something is lost, his pallor, and something else gained, his\ntan. This is a change in the category of quality, whence the\ncommon locution \u2018qualitative change\u2019. If he gains\nweight, then again something remains, Socrates, and something is gained,\nin this case a quantity of matter. Accordingly, in this instance we\nhave not a qualitative but a quantitative change. \n\n\nIn general, argues Aristotle, in whatever category a change occurs,\nsomething is lost and something gained within that category,\neven while something else, a substance, remains in existence, as the\nsubject of that change. Of course, substances can come into or go out of\nexistence, in cases of\ngeneration or destruction; and these are changes in the category of\nsubstance. Evidently even in cases of change in this category, however,\nsomething persists. To take an example favourable to Aristotle,\nin the case of the generation of a statue, the bronze persists, but it\ncomes to acquire a new form, a substantial rather than accidental\nform. In all cases, whether substantial or accidental, the\ntwo-factor analysis obtains: something remains the same and something\nis gained or lost. \n\n\n           \nIn its most rudimentary formulation, hylomorphism simply labels each of\nthe two factors: what persists is matter and what is gained is\nform. Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism quickly becomes\nmuch more complex, however, as the notions of matter and form are\npressed into philosophical service. Importantly, matter and form\ncome to be paired with another fundamental distinction, that between\npotentiality and actuality. Again in the case\nof the generation of a statue, we may say that the bronze is\npotentially a statue, but that it is an actual statue\nwhen and only when it is informed with the form of a\nstatue.   Of course, before being made into a statue, the\nbronze was also in potentiality a fair number of other\nartefacts\u2014a cannon, a steam-engine, or a goal on a football\npitch. Still, it was not in potentiality butter or a beach\nball. This shows that potentiality is not the same as\npossibility: to say that x is potentially F is to say that\nx already has actual features in virtue of which it might be\nmade to be F by the imposition of a F form upon it. So, given\nthese various connections, it becomes possible to define form and\nmatter generically as\n\nform =df that which makes some matter which is\npotentially F actually F\nmatter =df that which persists and which is, for some\nrange of Fs, potentially F\n\n\n\nOf course, these definitions are circular, but that is not in itself\na problem: actuality and potentiality are, for Aristotle, fundamental\nconcepts which admit of explication and description but do not admit of\nreductive analyses.\n\n\n           \nEncapsulating Aristotle\u2019s discussions of change in\nPhysics i 7 and 8, and putting the matter more crisply than he\nhimself does, we have the following simple argument for matter and\nform: (1) a necessary condition of there being change is the existence\nof matter and form; (2) there is change; hence (3) there are matter and\nform. The second premise is a phainomenon; so, if that\nis accepted without further defense, only the first requires\njustification. The first premise is justified by the thought that since\nthere is no generation ex nihilo, in every instance of change\nsomething persists while something else is gained or lost. In\nsubstantial generation or destruction, a substantial form is gained or\nlost; in mere accidental change, the form gained or lost is itself\naccidental. Since these two ways of changing exhaust the kinds of\nchange there are, in every instance of change there are two\nfactors present. These are matter and form.\n\n\n           \nFor these reasons, Aristotle intends his hylomorphism to be much more\nthan a simple explanatory heuristic. On the contrary, he maintains,\nmatter and form are mind-independent features of the world and must,\ntherefore, be mentioned in any full explanation of its workings.\n9. Aristotelian Teleology\n\n\n           \nWe may mainly pass over as uncontroversial the suggestion that there\nare efficient causes in favor of the most controversial and difficult\nof Aristotle four causes, the final\n cause.[19] \n We should note before doing so, however, that Aristotle\u2019s commitment\nto efficient causation does receive a defense in Aristotle\u2019s preferred\nterminology; he thus does more than many other philosophers who take\nit as given that causes of an efficient sort are operative. Partly by\nway of criticizing Plato\u2019s theory of Forms, which he regards as\ninadequate because of its inability to account for change and\ngeneration, Aristotle observes that nothing potential can bring itself\ninto actuality without the agency of an actually operative efficient\ncause. Since what is potential is always in potentiality relative to\nsome range of actualities, and nothing becomes actual of its own\naccord\u2014no pile of bricks, for instance, spontaneously organizes\nitself into a house or a wall\u2014an actually operative agent is\nrequired for every instance of change.  This is the efficient\ncause. These sorts of considerations also incline Aristotle to speak\nof the priority of actuality over potentiality: potentialities are\nmade actual by actualities, and indeed are always potentialities for\nsome actuality or other.  The operation of some actuality upon some\npotentiality is an instance of efficient causation.\n\nThat said, most of Aristotle\u2019s readers do not find themselves in need\nof a defense of the existence of efficient causation.  By contrast,\nmost think that Aristotle does need to provide a defense of final\ncausation. It is natural and easy for us to recognize final causal\nactivity in the products of human craft: computers and can-openers are\ndevices dedicated to the execution of certain tasks, and both their\nformal and material features will be explained by appeal to their\nfunctions. Nor is it a mystery where artefacts obtain their functions:\nwe give artefacts their functions. The ends of artefacts are the results of\nthe designing activities of intentional agents. Aristotle recognizes\nthese kinds of final causation, but also, and more problematically,\nenvisages a much greater role for teleology in natural explanation:\nnature exhibits teleology without design. He thinks, for instance,\nthat living organisms not only have parts which require teleological\nexplanation\u2014that, for instance, kidneys are for\npurifying the blood and teeth are for tearing and chewing\nfood\u2014but that whole organisms, human beings and other animals,\nalso have final causes. \n\n\nCrucially, Aristotle denies overtly that the causes operative in\nnature are intention-dependent. He thinks, that is, that\norganisms have final causes, but that they did not come to have them by\ndint of the designing activities of some intentional agent or\nother. He thus denies that a necessary condition of\nx\u2019s having a final cause is x\u2019s being\ndesigned. \n\n\nAlthough he has been persistently criticized for his commitment to\nsuch natural ends, Aristotle is not susceptible to a fair number of\nthe objections standardly made to his view.  Indeed, it is evident\nthat whatever the merits of the most penetrating of such criticisms,\nmuch of the contumely directed at Aristotle is stunningly\n illiterate.[20]  \n To take but one of any number of mind-numbing examples, the famous\nAmerican psychologist B. F. Skinner reveals that \u2018Aristotle\nargued that a falling body accelerated because it grew more jubilant\nas it found itself nearer its home\u2019 (1971, 6). To anyone who has\nactually read Aristotle, it is unsurprising that this ascription comes\nwithout an accompanying textual citation.  For Aristotle, as Skinner\nwould portray him, rocks are conscious beings having end states which\nthey so delight in procuring that they accelerate themselves in\nexaltation as they grow ever closer to attaining them. There is no\nexcuse for this sort of intellectual slovenliness, when already by the\nlate-nineteenth century, the German scholar Zeller was able to say\nwith perfect accuracy that \u2018The most important feature of the\nAristotelian teleology is the fact that it is neither anthropocentric\nnor is it due to the actions of a creator existing outside the world\nor even of a mere arranger of the world, but is always thought of as\nimmanent in nature\u2019 (1883, \u00a748).\n\n\n           \nIndeed, it is hardly necessary to caricature Aristotle\u2019s\nteleological commitments in order to bring them into critical\nfocus. In fact, Aristotle offers two sorts of defenses of\nnon-intentional teleology in nature, the first of which is replete with\ndifficulty. He claims in Physics ii 8:\nFor these [viz. teeth and all other parts of natural\nbeings] and all other natural things come about as they do either\nalways or for the most part, whereas nothing which comes about due to\nchance or spontaneity comes about always or for the most part. \n\u2026 If, then, these are either the result of coincidence or for the\nsake of something, and they cannot be the result of coincidence or\nspontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of\nsomething. Moreover, even those making these sorts of claims\n[viz. that everything comes to be by necessity] will agree that such\nthings are natural. Therefore, that for the sake of which is\npresent among things which come to be and exist by nature.\n(Phys. 198b32\u2013199a8)\n\n\nThe argument here, which has been variously formulated\n by\n scholars,[21]\nseems doubly problematic. \n\n\n           \nIn this argument Aristotle seems to introduce as a phainomenon\nthat nature exhibits regularity, so that the parts of nature come about\nin patterned and regular ways.   Thus, for instance, humans\ntend to have teeth arranged in a predictable sort of way, with incisors\nin the front and molars in the back. He then seems to contend, as\nan exhaustive and exclusive disjunction, that things happen either by\nchance or for the sake of something, only to suggest, finally, that\nwhat is \u2018always or for the most part\u2019\u2014what happens in\na patterned and predictable way\u2014is not plausibly thought to be\ndue to chance. Hence, he concludes, whatever happens always or\nfor the most part must happen for the sake of something, and so must\nadmit of a teleological cause. Thus, teeth show up always or for\nthe most part with incisors in the front and molars in the back; since\nthis is a regular and predictable occurrence, it cannot be due to\nchance. Given that whatever is not due to chance has a final\ncause, teeth have a final cause.\n\n\n           \nIf so much captures Aristotle\u2019s dominant argument for teleology, then\nhis view is unmotivated. The argument is problematic in the first\ninstance because it assumes an exhaustive and exclusive disjunction\nbetween what is by chance and what is for the sake of something. But\nthere are obviously other possibilities. Hearts beat not in order to\nmake noise, but they do so always and not by chance.  Second, and this\nis perplexing if we have represented him correctly, Aristotle is\nhimself aware of one sort of counterexample to this view and is indeed\nkeen to point it out himself: although, he insists, bile is regularly\nand predictably yellow, its being yellow is neither due simply to\nchance nor for the sake of anything. Aristotle in fact mentions many\nsuch counterexamples (Part. An. 676b16\u2013677b10,\nGen. An. 778a29\u2013b6). It seems to follow, then, short of\nascribing a straight contradiction to him, either that he is not\ncorrectly represented as we have interpreted this argument or that he\nsimply changed his mind about the grounds of teleology. Taking up\nthe first alternative, one possibility is that Aristotle is not really\ntrying to argue for teleology from the ground up in\nPhysics ii 8, but is taking it as already established that\nthere are teleological causes, and restricting himself to observing\nthat many natural phenomena, namely those which occur always or for the\nmost part, are good candidates for admitting of teleological\nexplanation.\n\n\n           \nThat would leave open the possibility of a broader sort of motivation\nfor teleology, perhaps of the sort Aristotle offers elsewhere in the\nPhysics, when speaking about the impulse to find\nnon-intention-dependent teleological causes at work in nature:\nThis is most obvious in the case of animals other than man:\nthey make things using neither craft nor on the basis of inquiry nor by\ndeliberation. This is in fact a source of puzzlement for those\nwho wonder whether it is by reason or by some other faculty that these\ncreatures work\u2014spiders, ants and the like. Advancing bit by\nbit in this same direction it becomes apparent that even in plants\nfeatures conducive to an end occur\u2014leaves, for example, grow in\norder to provide shade for the fruit. If then it is both by\nnature and for an end that the swallow makes its nest and the spider\nits web, and plants grow leaves for the sake of the fruit and send\ntheir roots down rather than up for the sake of nourishment, it is\nplain that this kind of cause is operative in things which come to be\nand are by nature. And since nature is twofold, as matter and as\nform, the form is the end, and since all other things are for sake of\nthe end, the form must be the cause in the sense of that for the sake\nof which. (Phys. 199a20\u201332)\n\n\nAs Aristotle quite rightly observes in this passage, we find\nourselves regularly and easily speaking in teleological terms when\ncharacterizing non-human animals and plants. It is consistent\nwith our so speaking, of course, that all of our easy language in these\ncontexts is rather too easy: it is in fact lax and careless, because unwarrantedly\nanthropocentric. We might yet demand that all such language be\nassiduously reduced to some non-teleological idiom when we are being\nscientifically strict and empirically serious, though we would first\nneed to survey the explanatory costs and benefits of our attempting to\ndo so. Aristotle considers and rejects some views hostile to\nteleology in Physics ii 8 and Generation and\nCorruption\n i.[22] \n10. Substance\n\n\n           \nOnce Aristotle has his four-causal explanatory schema fully on the\nscene, he relies upon it in virtually all of his most advanced\nphilosophical investigation. As he deploys it in various\nframeworks, we find him augmenting and refining the schema even as he\napplies it, sometimes with surprising results. One important\nquestion concerns how his hylomorphism intersects with the theory of\nsubstance advanced in the context of his theory of categories. \n\n\n\nAs we have seen, Aristotle insists upon the primacy of primary\nsubstance in his Categories. According to that work, however,\nstar instances of primary substance are familiar living beings like\nSocrates or an individual horse (Cat. 2a11014). Yet with the\nadvent of hylomorphism, these primary substances are revealed to be\nmetaphysical complexes: Socrates is a compound of matter and form. So,\nnow we have not one but three potential candidates for primary\nsubstance: form, matter, and the compound of matter and form. The\nquestion thus arises: which among them is the primary substance?  Is\nit the matter, the form, or the compound?  The compound corresponds to\na basic object of experience and seems to be a basic subject of\npredication: we say that Socrates lives in Athens, not that his matter\nlives in Athens. Still, matter underlies the compound and in this way\nseems a more basic subject than the compound, at least in the sense\nthat it can exist before and after it does. On the other hand, the\nmatter is nothing definite at all until enformed; so, perhaps form, as\ndetermining what the compound is, has the best claim on\nsubstantiality. \n\n\n           \nIn the middle books of his Metaphysics, which contain some of\nhis most complex and engaging investigations into basic being,\nAristotle settles on form (Met. vii 17). A\nquestion thus arises as to how form satisfies Aristotle\u2019s final\ncriteria for substantiality. He expects a substance to be, as he says,\nsome particular thing (tode ti), but also to be something\nknowable, some essence or other. These criteria seem to pull in\ndifferent directions, the first in favor of particular substances, as\nthe primary substances of the Categories had been particulars,\nand the second in favor of universals as substances, because they alone\nare knowable. In the lively controversy surrounding these\nmatters, many scholars have concluded that Aristotle adopts a third way\nforward: form is both knowable and particular. This matter,\nhowever, remains very acutely\n disputed.[23]\n\n\n\n           \nVery briefly, and not engaging these controversies, it becomes clear\nthat Aristotle prefers form in virtue of its role in generation and\ndiachronic persistence. When a statue is generated, or when a new\nanimal comes into being, something persists, namely the matter, which\ncomes to realize the substantial form in question. Even so,\ninsists Aristotle, the matter does not by itself provide the identity\nconditions for the new substance. First, as we have seen, the\nmatter is merely potentially some F until such time as it is made\nactually F by the presence of an F form. Further, the matter can\nbe replenished, and is replenished in the case of all\norganisms, and so seems to be form-dependent for its own diachronic\nidentity conditions. For these reasons, Aristotle thinks of the\nform as prior to the matter, and thus more fundamental than the\nmatter. This sort of matter, the form-dependent matter, Aristotle\nregards as proximate matter (Met. 1038b6, 1042b10),\nthus extending the notion of matter beyond its original role as\nmetaphysical substrate. \n\n\n           \nFurther, in Metaphysics vii 17 Aristotle offers a suggestive\nargument to the effect that matter alone cannot be substance. Let the\nvarious bits of matter belonging to Socrates be labeled as a,\nb, c, \u2026, n. Consistent with the\nnon-existence of Socrates is the existence\nof a, b, c, \u2026, n, since\nthese elements exist when they are spread from here to Alpha Centauri,\nbut if that happens, of course, Socrates no longer exists. Heading in the\nother direction, Socrates can exist without just these elements, since\nhe may exist when some one of a, b, c,\n\u2026, n is replaced or goes out of existence. So, in\naddition to his material elements, insists Aristotle, Socrates is also\nsomething else, something more (heteron ti; Met.\n1041b19\u201320). This something more is form, which is \u2018not\nan element\u2026but a primary cause of a thing\u2019s being what it\nis\u2019 (Met.  1041b28\u201330). The cause of a thing\u2019s being\nthe actual thing it is, as we have seen, is form. Hence, concludes\nAristotle, as the source of being and unity, form is substance. \n\n\nEven if this much is granted\u2014and to repeat, much of what has\njust been said is unavoidably controversial\u2014many questions\nremain. For example, is form best understood as universal or\nparticular?  However that issue is to be resolved, what is the\nrelation of form to the compound and to matter?  If form is\nsubstance, then what is the fate of these other two candidates? \nAre they also substances, if to a lesser degree?  It seems odd to\nconclude that they are nothing at all, or that the compound in\nparticular is nothing in actuality; yet it is difficult to contend that\nthey might belong to some category other than substance. \n\n\nFor an approach to some of these questions, see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.\n \n11. Living Beings\n\n\nHowever these and like issues are to be resolved, given the primacy of\nform as substance, it is unsurprising to find Aristotle identifying\nthe soul, which he introduces as a principle or source\n(arch\u00ea) of all life, as the form of a living\ncompound. For Aristotle, in fact, all living things, and not only\nhuman beings, have souls: \u2018what is ensouled is distinguished\nfrom what is unensouled by living\u2019 (DA 431a20\u201322;\ncf. DA 412a13, 423a20\u20136; De Part. An.\n687a24\u2013690a10; Met. 1075a16\u201325).  It is\nappropriate, then, to treat all ensouled bodies in hylomorphic\nterms: \n\n\nThe soul is the cause and source of the living body. But\ncause and source are meant in many ways [or are\nhomonymous].   Similarly, the soul is a cause in accordance\nwith the ways delineated, which are three: it is (i) the cause as the\nsource of motion [=the efficient cause], (ii) that for the sake of\nwhich [=the final cause], and (iii) as the substance of ensouled\nbodies. That it is a cause as substance is clear, for substance\nis the cause of being for all things, and for living things, being is\nlife, and the soul is also the cause and source of life. (DA\n415b8\u201314; cf. PN 467b12\u201325, Phys. 255a56\u201310) \n\n\n\n\nSo, the soul and body are simply special cases of form and\nmatter:\n\n\nsoul\u2009:\u2009body :: form\u2009:\u2009matter ::\nactuality\u2009:\u2009potentiality\n\n\n\n\nFurther, the soul, as the end of the compound organism, is also the\nfinal cause of the body. Minimally, this is to be understood as the\nview that any given body is the body that it is because it is\norganized around a function which serves to unify the entire\norganism. In this sense, the body\u2019s unity derives from the fact it has\na single end, or single life directionality, a state of affairs that\nAristotle captures by characterizing the body as the sort of matter\nwhich is organic (organikon; DA 412a28). By\nthis he means that the body serves as a tool for implementing the\ncharacteristic life activities of the kind to which the organism\nbelongs (organon = tool in Greek).  Taking all this\ntogether, Aristotle offers the view that the soul is the \u2018first\nactuality of a natural organic body\u2019 (DA\n412b5\u20136), that it is a \u2018substance as form of a natural\nbody which has life in potentiality\u2019 (DA \n412a20\u20131) and, again, that it \u2018is a first actuality of a\nnatural body which has life in potentiality\u2019 (DA \n412a27\u20138).\n\n\nAristotle contends that his hylomorphism provides an attractive middle\nway between what he sees as the mirroring excesses of his\npredecessors. In one direction, he means to reject Presocratic kinds\nof materialism; in the other, he opposes Platonic dualism.  He gives\nthe Presocratics credit for identifying the material causes of life,\nbut then faults them for failing to grasp its formal cause.  By\ncontrast, Plato earns praise for grasping the formal cause of life;\nunfortunately, as Aristotle sees things, he then proceeds to neglect\nthe material cause, and comes to believe that the soul can exist\nwithout its material basis.  Hylomorphism, in Aristotle\u2019s view,\ncaptures what is right in both camps while eschewing the unwarranted\nmono-dimensionality of each. To account for living organisms,\nAristotle contends, the natural scientist must attend to both matter\nand form.\n\n\nAristotle deploys hylomorphic analyses not only to the whole organism,\nbut to the individual faculties of the soul as well. Perception\ninvolves the reception of sensible forms without matter, and thinking,\nby analogy, consists in the mind\u2019s being enformed by intelligible\nforms. With each of these extensions, Aristotle both expands and\ntaxes his basic hylomorphism, sometimes straining its basic framework\nalmost beyond recognition. \n\n\n           \nFor more detail on Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism in psychological\nexplanation, see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Psychology.\n12. Happiness and Political Association\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s basic teleological framework extends to his ethical\nand political theories, which he regards as complementing one\nanother.   He takes it as given that most people wish to lead\ngood lives; the question then becomes what the best life for human\nbeings consists in. Because he believes that the best life for a\nhuman being is not a matter of subjective preference, he also believes\nthat people can (and, sadly, often do) choose to lead sub-optimal\nlives. In order to avoid such unhappy eventualities, Aristotle\nrecommends reflection on the criteria any successful candidate for the\nbest life must satisfy. He proceeds to propose one kind of life\nas meeting those criteria uniquely and therefore promotes it as the\nsuperior form of human life. This is a life lived in accordance with\nreason. \n\n\nWhen stating the general criteria for the final good for human beings,\nAristotle invites his readers to review them (EN\n1094a22\u201327). This is advisable, since much of the work of\nsorting through candidate lives is in fact accomplished during the\nhigher-order task of determining the criteria appropriate to this\ntask. Once these are set, it becomes relatively straightforward for\nAristotle to dismiss some contenders, including for instance hedonism,\nthe perennially popular view that pleasure is the highest good for\nhuman beings. \n\n\nAccording to the criteria advanced, the final good for human beings\nmust: (i) be pursued for its own sake (EN 1094a1); (ii) be\nsuch that we wish for other things for its sake (EN 1094a19);\n(iii) be such that we do not wish for it on account of other things\n(EN 1094a21); (iv) be complete (teleion), in the\nsense that it is always choiceworthy and always chosen for itself\n(EN 1097a26\u201333); and finally (v) be self-sufficient\n(autark\u00eas), in the sense that its presence suffices to\nmake a life lacking in nothing (EN 1097b6\u201316). Plainly\nsome candidates for the best life fall down in the face of these\ncriteria. According to Aristotle, neither the life of pleasure nor the\nlife of honour satisfies them all.\n\n\n           \nWhat does satisfy them all is happiness eudaimonia. Scholars in fact\ndispute whether eudaimonia is best rendered as\n\u2018happiness\u2019 or \u2018flourishing\u2019 or \u2018living\nwell\u2019 or simply transliterated and left an untranslated\n technical\n term.[24] \n If we have already determined that happiness is some sort of\nsubjective state, perhaps simple desire fulfillment, then\n\u2018happiness\u2019 will indeed be an inappropriate translation:\neudaimonia is achieved, according to Aristotle, by fully\nrealizing our natures, by actualizing to the highest degree our human\ncapacities, and neither our nature nor our endowment of human\ncapacities is a matter of choice for us. Still, as Aristotle frankly\nacknowledges, people will consent without hesitation to the suggestion\nthat happiness is our best good\u2014even while differing materially\nabout how they understand what happiness is. So, while seeming to\nagree, people in fact disagree about the human good.  Consequently, it\nis necessary to reflect on the nature of happiness\n(eudaimonia): \n\n\nBut perhaps saying that the highest good is happiness\n(eudaimonia) will appear to be a platitude and what is wanted\nis a much clearer expression of what this is. Perhaps this would come\nabout if the function (ergon) of a human being were\nidentified. For just as the good, and doing well, for a flute player,\na sculptor, and every sort of craftsman\u2014and in general, for\nwhatever has a function and a characteristic action\u2014seems to\ndepend upon function, so the same seems true for a human being, if\nindeed a human being has a function. Or do the carpenter and cobbler\nhave their functions, while a human being has none and is rather\nnaturally without a function (argon)?  Or rather, just as\nthere seems to be some particular function for the eye and the hand\nand in general for each of the parts of a human being, should one in\nthe same way posit a particular function for the human being in\naddition to all these?  Whatever might this be?  For living is common\neven to plants, whereas something characteristic (idion) is\nwanted; so, one should set aside the life of nutrition and\ngrowth. Following that would be some sort of life of perception, yet\nthis is also common, to the horse and the bull and to every\nanimal. What remains, therefore, is a life of action belonging to the\nkind of soul that has reason. (EN\n1097b22\u20131098a4)\n\n\nIn determining what eudaimonia consists in, Aristotle makes a crucial\nappeal to the human function (ergon), and thus to his\noverarching teleological framework. \n\n\nHe thinks that he can identify the human function in terms of\nreason, which then provides ample grounds for characterizing the happy\nlife as involving centrally the exercise of reason, whether practical\nor theoretical. Happiness turns out to be an activity of the\nrational soul, conducted in accordance with virtue or excellence, or,\nin what comes to the same thing, in rational activity executed\nexcellently (EN 1098a161\u201317).   It bears noting in\nthis regard that Aristotle\u2019s word for virtue,\naret\u00ea, is broader than the dominant sense of the English\nword \u2018virtue\u2019, since it comprises all manner of\nexcellences, thus including but extending beyond the moral virtues.\nThus when he says that happiness consists in an activity in\n\u2018accordance with virtue\u2019 (kat\u2019 aret\u00ean;\nEN 1098a18), Aristotle means that it is a kind of excellent\nactivity, and not merely morally virtuous activity.\n\n\n           \nThe suggestion that only excellently executed or\nvirtuously performed rational activity constitutes human\nhappiness provides the impetus for Aristotle\u2019s virtue\nethics. Strikingly, first, he insists that the good life is a life of\nactivity; no state suffices, since we are commended and\npraised for living good lives, and we are rightly commended or praised\nonly for things we (do) (EN 1105b20\u20131106a13).\nFurther, given that we must not only act, but act excellently or\nvirtuously, it falls to the ethical theorist to determine what virtue\nor excellence consists in with respect to the individual human\nvirtues, including, for instance, courage and practical\nintelligence. This is why so much of Aristotle\u2019s ethical writing\nis given over to an investigation of virtue, both in general and in\nparticular, and extending to both practical and theoretical forms.\n\n\n For more on Aristotle\u2019s virtue-based ethics, see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Ethics.\n\n\nAristotle concludes his discussion of human happiness in his\nNicomachean Ethics by introducing political theory as a\ncontinuation and completion of ethical theory.   Ethical\ntheory characterizes the best form of human life; political theory\ncharacterizes the forms of social organization best suited to its\nrealization (EN 1181b12\u201323). \n\n\n           \nThe basic political unit for Aristotle is the polis, which is\nboth a state in the sense of being an authority-wielding\nmonopoly and a civil society in the sense of being a series of\norganized communities with varying degrees of converging\ninterest.   Aristotle\u2019s political theory is markedly\nunlike some later, liberal theories, in that he does not think that the\npolis requires justification as a body threatening to infringe\non antecedently existing human rights. Rather, he advances a form\nof political naturalism which treats human beings as by nature\npolitical animals, not only in the weak sense of being gregariously\ndisposed, nor even in the sense of their merely benefiting from mutual\ncommercial exchange, but in the strong sense of their flourishing as\nhuman beings at all only within the framework of an organized\npolis. The polis \u2018comes into being for the sake\nof living, but it remains in existence for the sake of living\nwell\u2019 (Pol. 1252b29\u201330; cf. 1253a31\u201337). \n\n\nThe polis is thus to be judged against the goal of\npromoting human happiness. A superior form of political organization\nenhances human life; an inferior form hampers and hinders\nit.   One major question pursued in Aristotle\u2019s\nPolitics is thus structured by just this question: what sort\nof political arrangement best meets the goal of developing and\naugmenting human flourishing?   Aristotle considers a fair\nnumber of differing forms of political organization, and sets most\naside as inimical to the goal human happiness. For example, given\nhis overarching framework, he has no difficulty rejecting\ncontractarianism on the grounds that it treats as merely instrumental\nthose forms of political activity which are in fact partially\nconstitutive of human flourishing (Pol. iii 9). \n\n\nIn thinking about the possible kinds of political organization,\nAristotle relies on the structural observations that rulers may be one, few,\nor many, and that their forms of rule may be legitimate or\nillegitimate, as measured against the goal of promoting human\nflourishing (Pol. 1279a26\u201331). Taken together, these factors\nyield six possible forms of government, three correct and three\ndeviant:\n\n\n\nCorrect\nDeviant\n\n\nOne Ruler\nKingship\nTyranny\n\n\nFew Rulers\nAristocracy\nOligarchy\n\n\nMany Rulers\nPolity\nDemocracy\n\n\n\n\nThe correct are differentiated from the deviant by their relative\nabilities to realize the basic function of the polis: living\nwell. Given that we prize human happiness, we should, insists\nAristotle, prefer forms of political association best suited to this\ngoal. \n\n\nNecessary to the end of enhancing human flourishing, maintains\nAristotle, is the maintenance of a suitable level of distributive\njustice. Accordingly, he arrives at his classification of better\nand worse governments partly by considerations of distributive\njustice. He contends, in a manner directly analogous to his\nattitude towards eudaimonia, that everyone will find it easy\nto agree to the proposition that we should prefer a just state to an\nunjust state, and even to the formal proposal that the distribution of\njustice requires treating equal claims similarly and unequal claims\ndissimilarly. Still, here too people will differ about what\nconstitutes an equal or an unequal claim or, more generally, an equal\nor an unequal person. A democrat will presume that all citizens\nare equal, whereas an aristocrat will maintain that the best citizens\nare, quite obviously, superior to the inferior. Accordingly, the\ndemocrat will expect the formal constraint of justice to yield equal\ndistribution to all, whereas the aristocrat will take for granted that\nthe best citizens are entitled to more than the worst. \n\n\nWhen sorting through these claims, Aristotle relies upon his own\naccount of distributive justice, as advanced in Nicomachean\nEthics v 3. That account is deeply meritocratic. He\naccordingly disparages oligarchs, who suppose that justice requires\npreferential claims for the rich, but also democrats, who contend that\nthe state must boost liberty across all citizens irrespective of\nmerit. The best polis has neither function: its goal is\nto enhance human flourishing, an end to which liberty is at best\ninstrumental, and not something to be pursued for its own sake.\n\n\nStill, we should also proceed with a sober eye on what is in fact\npossible for human beings, given our deep and abiding acquisitional\npropensities. Given these tendencies, it turns out that although\ndeviant, democracy may yet play a central role in the sort of mixed\nconstitution which emerges as the best form of political organization\navailable to us. Inferior though it is to polity (that is, rule\nby the many serving the goal of human flourishing), and especially to\naristocracy (government by the best humans, the aristoi, also\ndedicated to the goal of human flourishing), democracy, as the best\namongst the deviant forms of government, may also be the most we can\nrealistically hope to achieve. \n\n\nFor an in-depth discussion of Aristotle\u2019s political theory,\nincluding his political naturalism, see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Politics.\n13. Rhetoric and the Arts\n\n\n           \nAristotle regards rhetoric and the arts as belonging to the productive\nsciences. As a family, these differ from the practical sciences\nof ethics and politics, which concern human conduct, and from the\ntheoretical sciences, which aim at truth for its own sake. \nBecause they are concerned with the creation of human products broadly\nconceived, the productive sciences include activities with obvious,\nartefactual products like ships and buildings, but also agriculture and\nmedicine, and even, more nebulously, rhetoric, which aims at the\nproduction of persuasive speech (Rhet. 1355b26; cf.\nTop. 149b5), and tragedy, which aims at\nthe production of edifying drama (Poet.\n1448b16\u201317).   If we bear in mind that Aristotle\napproaches all these activities within the broader context of his\nteleological explanatory framework, then at least some of the highly\npolemicized interpretative difficulties which have grown up around his\nworks in this area, particularly the Poetics, may be sharply\ndelimited. \n\n\n           \nOne such controversy centers on the question of whether\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and Poetics are primarily\ndescriptive or prescriptive\n works.[25] \n To the degree that they are indeed\nprescriptive, one may wonder whether Aristotle has presumed in these\ntreatises to dictate to figures of the stature of Sophocles and\nEuripides how best to pursue their crafts. To some\nextent\u2014but only to some extent\u2014it may seem that he\ndoes. There are, at any rate, clearly prescriptive elements in\nboth these texts. Still, he does not arrive at these\nrecommendations a priori. Rather, it is plain that\nAristotle has collected the best works of forensic speech and tragedy\navailable to him, and has studied them to discern their more and less\nsuccessful features. In proceeding in this way, he aims to\ncapture and codify what is best in both rhetorical practice and\ntragedy, in each case relative to its appropriate productive goal.\n\n\nThe general goal of rhetoric is clear. Rhetoric, says Aristotle,\n\u2018is the power to see, in each case, the possible ways to\npersuade\u2019 (Rhet. 1355b26). Different contexts, however,\nrequire different techniques. Thus, suggests Aristotle, speakers will\nusually find themselves in one of three contexts where persuasion is\nparamount: deliberative (Rhet. i 4\u20138), epideictic\n(Rhet. i 9), and judicial (Rhet. i 10\u201314). In each\nof these contexts, speakers will have at their disposal three main\navenues of persuasion: the character of the speaker, the emotional\nconstitution of the audience, and the general argument\n(logos) of the speech itself (Rhet. i 3). Rhetoric\nthus examines techniques of persuasion pursuant to each of these\nareas. \n\n\nWhen discussing these techniques, Aristotle draws heavily upon topics\ntreated in his logical, ethical, and psychological writings. In this\nway, the Rhetoric illuminates Aristotle\u2019s writings in these\ncomparatively theoretical areas by developing in concrete ways topics\ntreated more abstractly elsewhere. For example, because a successful\npersuasive speech proceeds alert to the emotional state of the\naudience on the occasion of its delivery, Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric contains some of his most nuanced and specific\ntreatments of the emotions.    Heading in another\ndirection, a close reading of the Rhetoric reveals that\nAristotle treats the art of persuasion as closely akin to dialectic\n(see \u00a74.3 above). Like dialectic, rhetoric trades in\ntechniques that are not scientific in the strict sense (see \u00a74.2\nabove), and though its goal is persuasion, it reaches its end best if\nit recognizes that people naturally find proofs and well-turned\narguments persuasive (Rhet. 1354a1, 1356a25,\n1356a30).   Accordingly, rhetoric, again like dialectic,\nbegins with credible opinions (endoxa), though mainly of the\npopular variety rather than those endorsed most readily by the wise\n(Top. 100a29\u201335; 104a8\u201320; Rhet.\n1356b34). Finally, rhetoric proceeds from such opinions to\nconclusions which the audience will understand to follow by cogent\npatterns of inference (Rhet. 1354a12\u201318,\n1355a5\u201321). For this reason, too, the rhetorician will do\nwell understand the patterns of human reasoning. \n\n\nFor more on Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric, see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric.\n\n\nBy highlighting and refining techniques for successful speech, the\nRhetoric is plainly prescriptive\u2014but only relative to\nthe goal of persuasion.   It does not, however, select its\nown goal or in any way dictate the end of persuasive speech: rather,\nthe end of rhetoric is given by the nature of the craft itself. \nIn this sense, the Rhetoric is like both the Nicomachean\nEthics and the Politics in bearing the stamp of\nAristotle\u2019s broad and encompassing teleology. \n\n\nThe same holds true of the Poetics, but in this case the\nend is not easily or uncontroversially articulated. It is often\nassumed that the goal of tragedy is catharsis\u2014the\npurification or purgation of the emotions aroused in a tragic\nperformance. Despite its prevalence, as an interpretation of what\nAristotle actually says in the Poetics this understanding is\nunderdetermined at best. When defining tragedy in a general way,\nAristotle claims:\n\n\nTragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious and\ncomplete, and which has some greatness about it. It imitates in words\nwith pleasant accompaniments, each type belonging separately to the\ndifferent parts of the work. It imitates people performing actions and\ndoes not rely on narration. It achieves, through pity and fear, the\ncatharsis of these sorts of feelings. (Poet.\n1449b21\u201329)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough he has been represented in countless works of scholarship\nas contending that tragedy is for the sake of catharsis,\nAristotle is in fact far more circumspect. While he does contend\nthat tragedy will effect or accomplish catharsis, in so speaking he\ndoes not use language which clearly implies that catharsis is in itself\nthe function of tragedy. Although a good blender will achieve a\nblade speed of 36,000 rotations per minute, this is not its function;\nrather, it achieves this speed in service of its function, namely\nblending. Similarly, then, on one approach, tragedy achieves\ncatharsis, though not because it is its function to do so.  \nThis remains so, even if it is integral to realizing its function that\ntragedy achieve catharsis\u2014as it is equally integral that it makes\nus of imitation (mim\u00easis), and does so by using words\nalong with pleasant accompaniments (namely, rhythm, harmony, and song;\nPoet. 1447b27). \n\n\n           \nUnfortunately, Aristotle is not completely forthcoming on the question\nof the function of tragedy.   One clue towards his attitude\ncomes from a passage in which he differentiates tragedy from historical\nwriting:\n\n\nThe poet and the historian differ not in that one writes in meter and\nthe other not; for one could put the writings of Herodotus into verse\nand they would be history none the less, with or without meter.  The\ndifference resides in this: the one speaks of what has happened, and\nthe other of what might be. Accordingly, poetry is more philosophical\nand more momentous than history. The poet speaks more of the\nuniversal, while the historian speaks of particulars. It is universal\nthat when certain things turn out a certain way someone will in all\nlikelihood or of necessity act or speak in a certain way\u2014which\nis what the poet, though attaching particular names to the situation,\nstrives for (Poet. 1451a38\u20131451b10).\n\n \n\n\nIn characterizing poetry as more philosophical, universal, and\nmomentous than history, Aristotle praises poets for their ability to\nassay deep features of human character, to dissect the ways in which\nhuman fortune engages and tests character, and to display how human\nfoibles may be amplified in uncommon circumstances. We do not,\nhowever, reflect on character primarily for entertainment value. \nRather, and in general, Aristotle thinks of the goal of tragedy in\nbroadly intellectualist terms: the function of tragedy is\n\u2018learning, that is, figuring out what each thing is\u2019\n(Poet. 1448b16\u201317). In Aristotle\u2019s view,\ntragedy teaches us about ourselves. \n\n\n           \nThat said, catharsis is undoubtedly a key concept in Aristotle\u2019s\nPoetics, one which, along with imitation\n(mim\u00easis), has generated enormous\n controversy.[26] \n These\ncontroversies center around three poles of interpretation: the\nsubject of catharsis, the matter of the catharsis,\nand the nature of catharsis. To illustrate what is\nmeant:  on a na\u00efve understanding of catharsis\u2014which may\nbe correct despite its na\u00efvet\u00e9\u2014the audience\n(the subject) undergoes catharsis by having the emotions (the\nmatter) of pity and fear it experiences purged (the\nnature). By varying just these three possibilities, scholars have\nproduced a variety of interpretations\u2014that it is the actors or\neven the plot of the tragedy which are the subjects of catharsis, that\nthe purification is cognitive or structural rather than emotional, and\nthat catharsis is purification rather than purgation. On this\nlast contrast, just as we might purify blood by filtering it, rather\nthan purging the body of blood by letting it, so we might refine our\nemotions, by cleansing them of their more unhealthy elements, rather\nthan ridding ourselves of the emotions by purging them\naltogether. The difference is considerable, since on one view the\nemotions are regarded as in themselves destructive and so to be purged,\nwhile on the other, the emotions may be perfectly healthy, even though,\nlike other psychological states, they may be improved by\nrefinement. The immediate context of the Poetics does\nnot by itself settle these disputes conclusively. \n\n\n           \nAristotle says comparatively more about the second main concept of the\nPoetics, imitation (mim\u00easis). Although\nless controversial than catharsis, Aristotle\u2019s conception of\nmim\u00easis has also been\n debated.[27] \n Aristotle thinks that\nimitation is a deeply ingrained human proclivity. Like political\nassociation, he contends, mim\u00easis is\nnatural. We engage in imitation from an early age,\nalready in language learning by aping competent speakers as we learn,\nand then also later, in the acquisition of character by treating others\nas role models. In both these ways, we imitate because we learn\nand grow by imitation, and for humans, learning is both natural and a\ndelight (Poet. 1148b4\u201324). This same tendency, in\nmore sophisticated and complex ways, leads us into the practice of\ndrama. As we engage in more advanced forms of\nmim\u00easis, imitation gives way to representation\nand depiction, where we need not be regarded as attempting to\ncopy anyone or anything in any narrow sense of the term. \nFor tragedy does not set out merely to copy what is the case, but\nrather, as we have seen in Aristotle\u2019s differentiation of tragedy\nfrom history, to speak of what might be, to engage universal themes in\na philosophical manner, and to enlighten an audience by their\ndepiction. So, although mim\u00easis is at root simple\nimitation, as it comes to serve the goals of tragedy, it grows more\nsophisticated and powerful, especially in the hands of those poets able\nto deploy it to good effect. \n14. Aristotle\u2019s Legacy\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s influence is difficult to overestimate. After\nhis death, his school, the Lyceum, carried on for some period of time,\nthough precisely how long is unclear. In the century immediately\nafter his death, Aristotle\u2019s works seem to have fallen out of\ncirculation; they reappear in the first century B.C.E., after which time\nthey began to be disseminated, at first narrowly, but then much more\nbroadly. They eventually came to form the backbone of some seven\ncenturies of philosophy, in the form of the\n commentary tradition,\n much of it original philosophy carried on in\na broadly Aristotelian framework. They also played a very\nsignificant, if subordinate role, in the Neoplatonic philosophy of\n Plotinus\n and\n Porphyry. \nThereafter, from the sixth through the twelfth centuries, although the\nbulk of Aristotle\u2019s writings were lost to the West, they received\nextensive consideration in\n Byzantine Philosophy,\n and in Arabic Philosophy,  where Aristotle was so\nprominent that be became known simply as The First Teacher (see\nthe entry on the\n influence of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on the Latin West).\n In this tradition, the notably rigorous and illuminating commentaries of\nAvicenna and Averroes interpreted and developed Aristotle\u2019s views\nin striking ways. These commentaries in turn proved exceedingly\ninfluential in the earliest reception of the Aristotelian corpus into\nthe Latin West in the twelfth century.\n\n           \nAmong Aristotle\u2019s greatest exponents during the early period of\nhis reintroduction to the West,\n Albertus Magnus,\n and above all his student\n Thomas Aquinas,\n sought to reconcile Aristotle\u2019s philosophy with Christian\nthought. Some Aristotelians disdain Aquinas as bastardizing Aristotle,\nwhile some Christians disown Aquinas as pandering to pagan\nphilosophy. Many others in both camps take a much more positive view,\nseeing Thomism as a brilliant synthesis of two towering traditions;\narguably, the incisive commentaries written by Aquinas towards the end\nof his life aim not so much at synthesis as straightforward exegesis\nand exposition, and in these respects they have few equals in any\nperiod of philosophy.  Partly due to the attention of Aquinas, but for\nmany other reasons as well, Aristotelian philosophy set the framework\nfor the Christian philosophy of the twelfth through the sixteenth\ncenturies, though, of course, that rich period contains a broad range\nof philosophical activity, some more and some less in sympathy with\nAristotelian themes. To see the extent of Aristotle\u2019s influence, however,\nit is necessary only to recall that the two concepts forming the\nso-called\n binarium famosissimum\n (\u201cthe most famous pair\u201d) of that\nperiod, namely universal hylomorphism and the doctrine of the plurality\nof forms, found their first formulations in Aristotle\u2019s\ntexts.\n\n\n           \nInterest in Aristotle continued unabated throughout the renaissance in\nthe form of\n Renaissance Aristotelianism.\n The dominant figures of this period overlap\nwith the last flowerings of Medieval Aristotelian Scholasticism, which\nreached a rich and highly influential close in the figure of\nSu\u00e1rez, whose life in turn overlaps with Descartes. From\nthe end of late Scholasticism, the study of Aristotle has undergone\nvarious periods of relative neglect and intense interest, but has been\ncarried forward unabated down to the present day. \n\n\nToday, philosophers of various stripes continue to look to Aristotle\nfor guidance and inspiration in many different areas, ranging from the\nphilosophy of mind to theories of the infinite, though perhaps\nAristotle\u2019s influence is seen most overtly and avowedly in the\nresurgence of\n virtue ethics\n which began in the last half of the twentieth century. \nIt seems safe at this stage to predict that Aristotle\u2019s stature\nis unlikely to diminish anytime in the foreseeable future. If it is any\nindication of the direction of things to come, a quick search of the\npresent Encyclopedia turns up more citations to \u2018Aristotle\u2019 and\n\u2018Aristotelianism\u2019 than to any other philosopher or\nphilosophical movement. Only Plato comes close. \n",
