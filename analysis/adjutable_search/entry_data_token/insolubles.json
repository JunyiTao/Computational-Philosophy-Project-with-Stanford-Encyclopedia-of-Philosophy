Origins of the Medieval Discussion\n\nThe Liar Paradox was well known to antiquity. Its discovery is often\ncredited to Eubulides the Megarian (4th century BCE), on the basis of\na remark by Diogenes Laertius (Lives of the Philosophers\nII.108), although in fact Diogenes says only that Eubulides discussed\nthe paradox, not that he discovered\n it.[2]\n A little later, the poet and grammarian Philetus (or Philitas) of Cos\n(c. 330\u2013c. 270 BCE), if we are to believe the story in Athenaeus\nof Naucratis\u2019s Deipnosophists IX.401e, worried so much\nover the Liar that he wasted away and died of insomnia, as, according\nto Athenaeus, his epitaph recorded:\n\n\nPhiletus of Cos am I\n\n\u2019Twas The Liar who made me die,\n\nAnd the bad nights caused\n thereby.[3]\n\n\nDiogenes Laertius also reports (VII.196\u201398) that, in addition to\na huge number of other works on a variety of topics, the Stoic\nlogician Chrysippus (c. 279\u2013206 BCE) wrote:\n\nIntroduction to the Liar;\nLiar Propositions: An Introduction;\nsix books on the Liar itself;\nReply to Those Who Think There Are Propositions That Are Both\nTrue and False;\nReply to Those Who Solve the Liar Proposition by\nDivision;\nOn the Solution to the Liar (in three books);\nReply to Those Who Say The Liar Argument Has False\nPremises.\n\n\nUnfortunately, almost none of Chrysippus\u2019 work survives.\n1.1 Unlikely Ancient Sources\n\nNonetheless, it does not appear that medieval interest in insolubles\nwas derived directly from these or any other known ancient sources\nthat discuss the Liar. Many of the relevant works were lost (e.g., the\nworks of Chrysippus), while others were never translated into Latin\nand so were effectively unavailable to the Latin Middle Ages, though\nthings may be different for the Arabic and Byzantine traditions, which\nare only starting to be studied (see, e.g., Alwishah & Sanson\n2009, Gerogiorgakis 2009, El-Rouayheb 2020 and Zarepour 2020). Indeed,\nit is not at all clear just what it was that prompted medieval\ninterest. One might have supposed that, even if particular theories\nabout the Liar were not transmitted to the Latin West from antiquity,\nat least formulations of Liar-type paradoxes must have been known and\navailable to stimulate the medieval discussions. In fact, however,\nthere are strikingly few possibilities.\n\nSeneca (Epistle 45.10), for instance, mentions the Liar\nparadox by its Greek name pseudomenon, but does not actually\nformulate it. Again, St Augustine perhaps has the Liar in mind in his\nAgainst the Academicians (Contra academicos\nIII.13.29), where he refers to the \u201cmost lying calumny,\n\u2018if it is true [it is] false, if it is false it is\ntrue\u2019\u201d. But neither passage would likely be sufficient by\nitself to suggest the special problems of the Liar to anyone not\nalready familiar with them.\n\nSomewhat more explicit is Aulus Gellius\u2019s (2nd century CE)\nAttic Nights (XVIII.ii.10), \u201cWhen I lie and say I am\nlying, am I lying or speaking the truth?\u201d But Gellius was not\nwidely read in the Middle Ages, and no known medieval author cites him\nin the context of\n insolubles.[4]\n Again, Cicero\u2019s Academica priora,\nII.xxix.95\u2013xxx.97, contains a fairly clear formulation:\n\n\nIf you lie and speak that truth [namely, that you lie], are you lying\nor speaking the truth? \u2026 If you say you lie, and you speak the\ntruth, you lie; but you say you lie, and you speak the truth;\ntherefore, you lie.\n\n\nBut this passage is never cited in the\ninsolubilia-literature. Moreover Cicero, who wrote in Latin\nand so did not have to be translated to be available to the Middle\nAges, calls such paradoxes \u201cinexplicables\u201d\n(inexplicabilia). If he was the catalyst for the medieval\ndiscussions, we would have expected to find that term in the\ninsolubilia-literature, and we do not; the unanimous medieval\nterm is \u2018insolubles\u2019.\n1.2 St. Paul\u2019s Reference to Epimenides\n\nOne initially plausible stimulus for the medieval discussions would\nappear to be the Epistle to Titus 1:12: \u201cOne of themselves, even\na prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [= Cretans] are always\nliars, evil beasts, slow bellies\u201d. The Cretan in question is\ntraditionally said to have been the sixth-century BCE thinker\nEpimenides. For this reason, the Liar Paradox is nowadays sometimes\nreferred to as the \u201cEpimenides\u201d. Yet, blatant as the\nparadox is here, and authoritative as the Epistle was taken to be, not\na single medieval author is known to have discussed or even\nacknowledged the logical and semantic problems this text poses. When\nmedieval authors discuss the passage at all, for instance in\nScriptural commentaries, they seem to be concerned only with why St.\nPaul should be quoting pagan\n sources.[5]\n It is not known who was the first to link this text with the Liar\nParadox.\n1.3 Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations\n\nBy contrast with these passages, none of which was cited in the\ninsolubilia-literature, there is a text from\nAristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations 25, [A-SR]:\n180a27\u2013b7, that, almost from the very beginning of the\ninsolubilia-literature to the end of the Middle Ages, served\nas the framework for discussing insolubles. It occurs in\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the fallacy of confusing things said\n\u201cin a certain respect\u201d (secundum quid) with\nthings said \u201cabsolutely\u201d or \u201cwithout\nqualification\u201d (simpliciter). In this context,\nAristotle considers someone who takes an oath that he will become an\noath-breaker, and then does so. Absolutely or without qualification,\nAristotle says, such a man is an oath-breaker, even though with\nrespect to the particular oath to become an oath-breaker he\nis an oath-keeper. Then Aristotle adds the intriguing remark,\n\u201cThe argument is similar too concerning the same man\u2019s\nlying and speaking the truth at the same time\u201d ([A-SR]:\n180b2\u20133). It was this sentence that many medieval authors took\nto be a reference to the Liar Paradox, which therefore, on the\nauthority of Aristotle, could be solved as a fallacy secundum quid\net simpliciter.\n\nThe widespread appeal to this passage throughout the history of the\ninsolubilia-literature indicates that the text did play some\nrole in prompting medieval interest in insolubles. This suggestion is\nreinforced by the fact that the earliest known medieval statement of\nthe Liar occurs in 1132, around the time the Sophistical\nRefutations first began to circulate in Western Europe in Latin\ntranslation (see\n Section 2\n below).\n\nNevertheless, it is not immediately obvious how Aristotle\u2019s\nremarks can be made to fit the Liar Paradox. The oath-breaker, as the\nexample was generally interpreted, takes two oaths: one,\nwhich he keeps, that he will break his oath, and a second (it does not\nmatter what it is) that he breaks, thereby fulfilling the first oath.\nThe man is an oath-breaker and an oath-fulfiller, but with respect to\ndifferent oaths; by breaking his second oath, rendering it\nfalse, he fulfills the first oath, making it true. However, it is\npossible to interpret the passage as referring to a single oath, when\nthe oath is broken at the same time as it is made. Seen that way, it\nconnects the Liar paradox with the fallacy secundum quid et\n simpliciter.[6]\n\nIn short, it seems clear that the Sophistical Refutations was\ninstrumental in prompting medieval interest in insolubles. But more\nmust have been involved too. Martin (1993) suggests a connection with\ntheories of obligations (cf.\n Section 3.3\n below). Before medieval logicians could formulate genuine Liar-type\nparadoxes, they first had to go well beyond anything found in\nAristotle\u2019s text. At present we cannot say whether they did this\non the basis of some still unidentified ancient source or whether it\nwas through their own intellectual power and logical insight.\n1.4 The Many Varieties of Insolubles\n\nThe medievals discussed many more insolubles than the Liar Paradox,\nthough most can be seen as variants of it. One common variant was what\nis now called the \u2018yes\u2019-\u2018no\u2019 paradox: Socrates\nsays \u201cWhat Plato is saying is false\u201d, while Plato says\n\u201cWhat Socrates is saying is true\u201d (see, e.g., Buridan\n[B-SD]: 974). There is also the \u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019\nparadox, where Plato instead says \u201cWhat Socrates is saying is\nfalse\u201d (Buridan [B-SD]: 971). There is even a\n\u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019 paradox, where\nSocrates says that Plato is saying something false, Plato that Cicero\nis saying something false and Cicero that Socrates is saying something\nfalse (Albert [AS-I]: 353). There are conjunctive insolubles, e.g.,\n\u201cGod exists and some conjunction is false\u201d, where God has\nannihilated any other conjunction, and disjunctive insolubles, e.g.,\n\u201cA man is an ass or some disjunction is false\u201d, where God\nhas instead annihilated any other disjunctive proposition (Albert\n[AS-I]: 357\u20138). There is also a nice example where a landowner\nhas decreed that only those who speak truly will be allowed across his\nbridge and those who lie about their business will be thrown in the\nwater (or maybe even hanged on the nearby gallows). When Socrates is\nchallenged on coming to the river, he says \u201cYou will throw me in\nthe water\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: 135; Buridan [B-SD]: 993; see\nalso Cervantes Don Quixote, vol. II book III ch. XIX, p.\n714).\n\nThe medievals discovered what is now usually referred to as\nCurry\u2019s Paradox, in the form \u201cIf this conditional is true\nthen a man is an ass\u201d (see Read 2002: section 9), or in its\ncontraposed form, \u201cIf God exists then some conditional is\nfalse\u201d (where this is the only conditional: Albert [AS-I]: 359);\nor in the form of an inference (consequentia), nowadays\ndubbed \u201cV-Curry\u201d, \u201cThis inference is valid so you\nare an ass\u201d (see the discussion in\n Section 3.9\n below). There were also epistemic paradoxes, such as \u201cYou do\nnot know this proposition\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: 139): you do not\nknow it, for if you did, it would be true and you would not know it.\nBut now you must realise that you do know it. Such insolubles can\ninvolve doubt as well as knowledge, e.g., \u201cSocrates knows the\nproposition written on the wall to be doubtful to him\u201d (see\n note 32).\n Further insolubles arise from the medieval theory of (logical)\n Obligations,\n e.g., \u201cSomething proposed is denied by you\u201d (Bradwardine\n[B-I]: 125), and \u201cThe king is sitting or a disjunctive doubt is\nproposed\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: 151)\u2014in the theory of\nobligations, the respondent is taken never to know whether the king is\nsitting.\n2. Early Developments to the 1320s\n\nIn 1132, Adam of Balsham, the founder of the important logical school\nof the \u201cParvipontani\u201d (so called because they\ngathered at the Petit Pont in Paris), wrote an Art of\nDiscussing (Ars disserendi), in which he treats, among\nother things, various kinds of yes/no questions, including\n\u201cwhether he speaks truly who says he lies\u201d and\n\u201cwhether he who says nothing but that he lies is speaking the\ntruth\u201d. ([AB]: 107.)\n\nThe importance of this passage should not be exaggerated. It is true\nthat it gives us the earliest known explicit medieval formulation of\nthe\n Liar.[7]\n But Adam makes no attempt to solve the paradox, does not say it was a\ncurrent topic of discussion in his day, and in fact does not even\nindicate he recognized its paradoxicalness. He simply offers it as an\nexample of one kind of yes/no question.\n\nIt is not until later in the twelfth century that one finds an\nexplicit statement of the special problems raised by insolubles. In\nhis On the Natures of Things (De naturis rerum), of\nunknown date but apparently well known by the end of the century,\nAlexander Neckham ([N-NR]: 289)\n wrote[8]:\n\n\nAgain, if Socrates says he lies, and says nothing else, he says some\nproposition. Therefore, either a true one or a false one. Therefore,\nif Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true or what is\nfalse.\n\nBut if (1) Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies, and\nhe says what is true, then it is true that Socrates lies. And\nif it is true that Socrates lies, Socrates says what is false.\nTherefore, if Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies,\nand he says what is true, he says what is false.\n\nBut if (2) Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies, and\nhe says what is false, then it is false that Socrates says\nwhat is false. And if it is false that Socrates says what is false,\nSocrates does not say what is false. But if Socrates says only that he\nlies, he says either what is true or what is false. Therefore, if\nSocrates says he lies, he says what is true. Therefore, if Socrates\nsays only that he lies, and he says what is false, then he says what\nis true.\n\nBut if Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true or false.\nTherefore, if Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true\nand says what is false.\n\n\nNevertheless, although it is clear that Neckham was fully aware of\nwhat is paradoxical about the Liar, he makes no attempt to\nsolve the paradox. He presents it only as an example of the\n\u201cvanities\u201d logic deals with. This suggests that by his day\nothers were trying to solve the paradox, and in fact in the\ndiscussion of the fallacy secundum quid et simpliciter\ncontained in the so-called Munich Logic (= Dialectica\nMonacensis) from sometime in the second half of the century, we\nfind the remark: \u201cBut how this fallacy arises in uttering the\ninsoluble \u2018I am saying a falsehood\u2019, that is a matter\ndiscussed in the treatise on\n insolubles\u201d.[9]\n\nThe first text we have that actually tries to solve the paradox is an\nanonymous treatise from the very end of the twelfth or the very early\nthirteenth century (De Rijk 1966). From then on, there are a great\nnumber of surviving treatments (see Spade 1975). In the early 1320s,\nThomas Bradwardine, in a preliminary section of his own treatise on\ninsolubles, lists eight views in circulation in his day, in addition\nto his own (see Bradwardine [B-I], ch. 2; Spade 1987: 43\u201346).\nSome of these views can no longer be identified in the texts that\nsurvive from the period before Bradwardine, but among the surviving\nviews, we can distinguish five broad approaches to\n\u201csolving\u201d the\n paradox.[10]\n (Sometimes these approaches are combined in a single author.)\n2.1 Insolubles as Fallacies secundum quid et simpliciter\n\nAs might be expected in view of\n Section 1.3\n above, many of these early theories attempted to analyze insolubles\nas fallacies secundum quid et simpliciter. Later in the\ninsolubilia-literature, discussions often continued to be\ncast in terms of this fallacy. It was claimed in (Spade 1987: 32) that\ntheir real focus was generally on entirely different theoretical\nissues, and that the role of the fallacy thus became purely\n\u201chonorary\u201d, preserving the authority of Aristotle.\nHowever, that assessment was challenged in (Dutilh Novaes & Read\n2008). Bradwardine, for example, explicitly and repeatedly casts his\nsolution in terms of Aristotle\u2019s discussion, making actual (not\nmerely \u201chonorary\u201d) use of the conceptual framework offered\nby the fallacy secundum quid et\n simpliciter.[11]\n\nAs remarked above, Aristotle had suggested ([A-SR]: 180b5\u20137)\nthat insolubles are false simpliciter (absolutely/without\nqualification), but true secundum quid (in a certain\nrespect). Some authors in the early medieval literature, however,\nargued that insolubles are without qualification neither true nor\nfalse, but only true in a certain respect and false in a certain\n respect.[12]\n Others used the terminology of simpliciter and secundum\nquid, but applied it to reference (suppositio) rather\nthan to truth and falsehood, so that in insolubles certain terms did\nnot refer \u201cwithout qualification\u201d to their referents, but\nonly \u201cin a certain respect\u201d. This view is in effect a kind\nof restriction on\n self-reference.[13]\n2.2 The Theory of Transcasus\n\nThe theory of transcasus has nothing to do with the fallacy\nsecundum quid et simpliciter, although it too seems to have\nhad its origins in antiquity. The word transcasus is not a\ncommon Latin word. It seems to be a literal translation of Greek\nmetaptosis. In Stoic logic, propositions that change their\ntruth value over time were called metapiptonta (from the same\nroot). Walter Burley in fact used the word transcasus exactly\nthis way in 1302 in two short logical works (Spade 1987:\n33\u201334).\n\nNevertheless, in the particular context of insolubles, while the term\ntranscasus does have an association with time, it does not\nimply any change of truth value over time. Rather the theory\nof transcasus held that in the proposition \u201cThis\nstatement is false\u201d, the term \u201cfalse\u201d refers\nnot to the proposition in which it occurs, but rather to some\nproposition uttered earlier. Thus, when the liar says \u201cI am\nlying\u201d, what he really means is \u201cWhat I said just a moment\nago was a lie\u201d. If the speaker did not in fact say anything\nearlier, then his present statement is simply false and no paradox\n arises.[14]\n\nThis view, like the last of those discussed in\n Section 2.4\n below, amounts in practice to a restriction on self-reference. But it\nis not clear exactly what motivated it. In any event, the theory of\ntranscasus appears to have disappeared as a theory actually\nheld by anyone after the early period, although it continued to be\nmentioned in later authors\u2019 surveys of earlier\n views.[15]\n2.3 Exercised Act vs. Signified (or Conceived) Act\n\nA third theory from this early period distinguishes the\n\u201cexercised\u201d act from the \u201csignified\u201d or\n\u201cconceived\u201d act. The details of this theory are not yet\nwell understood, but the basic strategy is to distinguish what the\nliar says he is doing (namely, lying) from what he really\nis doing. The author of the Questions on the Sophistical\nRefutations attributed to John Duns Scotus, who held a version of\nthis theory (Scotus [DS-Q], questions 52\u201353, pp. 505\u201315),\nthought that what the liar is really doing (the \u201cexercised\nact\u201d) is speaking the truth. In order to avoid the paradox, this\ntheory would seem to be committed to saying that the exercised act and\nthe signified act are two distinct acts, so that the theory,\nlike the theory of transcasus\n (Section 2.2\n above), is committed to some kind of restriction on\n self-reference.[16]\n2.4 The Theory of Restriction\n\nEven when not combined with transcasus or the theory that\ndistinguishes exercised act from signified act, a very popular\napproach throughout the insolubilia-literature, in the early\nperiod (and for that matter even in our own day), before\nBradwardine\u2019s sustained attack on it (see\n  Section 3.1),\n was to deny or restrict the possibility of self-reference. Such\ntheories had the title \u201crestriction\u201d (restrictio)\nand their proponents were called \u201crestricters\u201d\n(restringentes). All such theories maintained that in some or\neven all cases, terms in propositions could not \u201csupposit\nfor\u201d (stand for, refer to) the propositions in which they\noccur.\n\nSome theories of restriction went further and also ruled out other\npatterns of reference. For example:\n\nProposition a = \u2018b is true\u2019, and\nb = \u2018a is false\u2019 (the\n\u2018yes\u2019-\u2018no\u2019 paradox). Here a refers to\nb and b refers back to a. But reference is not a\ntransitive relation, so that there is no real self-reference\nhere. Nevertheless, the situation is paradoxical, and as a result some\nrestricters ruled out all referential \u201cloops\u201d.\nProposition a is a certain token of the form\n\u2018a is false\u2019, and b is a second token of the\nsame type. Token a is self-referential, but token b is\nnot, since it refers to a, not to itself. Yet some restricters\nthought the two tokens should be treated semantically alike, so that\nnot only could the subject of a not refer to a itself,\nneither could the subject of b.\nProposition a = \u2018b is true\u2019, and\nproposition b = \u2018b is false\u2019. Here, b\nis self-referential, but a is not. Nevertheless, b is\nthe contradictory of a. Hence, by saying its contradictory is\ntrue, a is in effect saying that it itself is false. Thus,\nalthough it is not self-referential, a is nevertheless\nparadoxical. Some restricters prevented such cases by maintaining that\nnot only were terms unable to refer to the propositions in which they\noccurred, they also could not refer to the contradictories of\nthe propositions in which they occurred.\n\n\nAs a general theory, restriction is open to an obvious objection: it\nrules out innocuous forms of reference along with pathological ones.\nThe sentence \u201cThis sentence has five words\u201d is not\nparadoxical, after all, even though it is self-referential; in fact,\nit seems obviously true. Yet the general theory of restriction would\ndisallow it.\n\nMedieval authors sometimes raised this objection. As a result, we find\ntwo kinds of restriction-theories in the medieval literature:\n(a) general or strong theories that rule out self-reference, and\nperhaps other patterns of reference too, in innocuous as well as\npathological cases; and (b) more specialized or weaker theories that\nrule out certain forms of reference only when they result in paradox.\nWalter Burley and William of Ockham, for example, held the latter form\nof restriction (Spade 1974).\n\nIf general or strong theories of restriction are open to the objection\nstated above, the weaker theories are open to a different objection:\nthey risk being vacuous if their proponents did not have any\nindependent way of identifying paradoxical cases. Perhaps, their\ntheories amounted to saying \u201call forms of reference are allowed,\nexcept for paradoxical ones, which are not allowed\u201d. This is no\ndoubt true, but it is also a\n tautology.[17]\n The restrictivist response largely died out after Bradwardine\u2019s\nattack on it in chs. 3\u20134 of his Insolubles. However, in\nthe late 1320s, Walter de Segrave (or Sexgrave) gave a spirited\ndefence of restrictivism against Bradwardine\u2019s arguments (see\n  Section 3.2\n and Spade 1975 item LXVIII, pp. 113\u20136).\n\n2.5 Cassation\n\nUnlike restriction, which remained (and remains) a popular view, the\ntheory of \u201ccassation\u201d disappeared very early (though it\nhas its contemporary advocates). It is maintained in the earliest\nknown treatise on insolubles (De Rijk 1966) and in one other early\nanonymous text (Spade 1975: 43\u201344), but seems to have died out\nafter about 1225, although it continued to be mentioned in later\nauthors\u2019 surveys of previous views, no doubt because of its\ninclusion in Bradwardine\u2019s own survey. It was briefly revived by\nJohn Dumbleton in the 1340s: see\n  Section 3.6\n and Spade 1975 item XXXVI, pp. 63\u20135). His essential idea was\nthat signification requires uptake, so any utterance which cannot be\nunderstood cannot constitute a proposition\u2014and the insolubles\ndefy understanding, for self-reference generates a regress of deferred\nintelligibility.\n\n\u2018Cassation\u2019 is now an archaic word (though it survives in\nlegal documents and other languages), but merely means \u201cmaking\nnull and void, canceling\u201d. In effect, this theory holds that one\nwho utters an insoluble proposition \u201cisn\u2019t saying\nanything\u201d. The second of the texts just cited even gives a\ncurious \u201cordinary language\u201d argument, appealing to the\nrusticus (the man-in-the-street), who, if you were to say to\nhim \u201cWhat I am saying is false\u201d, would reply\n\u201cNil dicis\u201d (\u201cYou are saying\nnothing\u201d).\n\nThe treatise in De Rijk 1966 presents more of a theory. Much of it is\nobscure to modern scholars, but it seems to appeal to a distinction\nbetween a mental act of asserting and a vocal act of uttering a\nproposition. \u201cSaying\u201d requires both acts; it is \u201can\nassertion with utterance\u201d. In the case of the liar who says\n\u201cWhat I am saying is false\u201d, the mental act of asserting\nis present, and for that matter so is the physical act of uttering the\nwords. But somehow (this is the obscure part) there is no\n\u201csaying\u201d.\n\nIt is tempting to interpret this view as an appeal to a kind of\nfallacy of composition; just as someone who is both good and an author\nis not necessarily a good author, so too something that is both\nmentally asserted and vocally uttered is not necessarily\n\u201csaid\u201d (asserted with utterance). It is tempting, yes, but\nhighly speculative. Nevertheless, whatever the correct interpretation,\nit appears that the distinction between asserting and uttering drawn\nby this theory escapes the facile \u201crefutation\u201d of it used\nas early as the mid-thirteenth century, that it \u201cplainly\ncontradicts sensation that is not\n deceived\u201d.[18]\n3. The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century\n\nThe preceding theories represent the earliest stage of the\ninsolubilia-literature. Although these theories are sometimes\nmentioned in the later literature, and in the case of\n\u201crestriction\u201d often accepted in the later\nliterature, much more sophisticated treatments began to emerge in the\nsecond quarter of the fourteenth century. The turning point is Thomas\nBradwardine, whose own theory was enormously influential on later\nauthors. Shortly after Bradwardine, two other English authors from\nthis middle period are also important: Roger Swyneshed\n (Section 3.3),\n and William Heytesbury\n (Section 3.4).\n A little later, important contributions were made by Parisian\nauthors, Gregory of Rimini\n (Section 3.7),\n John Buridan\n (Section 3.8)\n and Albert of Saxony\n (Section 3.9).\n3.1 Thomas Bradwardine\n\nThomas Bradwardine (c. 1300\u20131349) wrote his Insolubles\nat Oxford sometime between 1321 and 1324. It became one of the most\nimportant works on the topic in the Middle Ages. In fact, in the late\n1350s, Ralph Strode, in his own treatise on the topic, surveys the\nearlier views (quoting Bradwardine\u2019s own survey and theory\nalmost verbatim), and then says (Spade 1981: 116):\n\n\nFor the opinions mentioned above were those of the old [logicians],\nwho understood little or nothing about insolubles. After them there\narose the prince of modern philosophers of nature, namely Master\nThomas Bradwardine. He was the first one who discovered something\nworthwhile about insolubles.\n\n\nBradwardine\u2019s theory is built around a distinctive theory of\ntruth, which in turn depends on a conception of signification,\ndescribed by Spade as an \u201cadverbial\u201d theory of\npropositional signification (Spade 2007: 180\u201387\n [Other Internet Resources];\n cf. Read 2008b: \u00a713.2). By virtue of their constituent terms,\npropositions signify things; but, in addition, a proposition as a\nwhole signifies that such-and-such is the case. This\nconception may be related to Walter Burley\u2019s theory of the\npropositio in re (see, e.g., Cesalli 2001). It is this latter\nkind of signification that is the basis for Bradwardine\u2019s theory\nof truth.\n\nFor Bradwardine, (D1) a proposition is true if it signifies\nonly as is the case (tantum sicut est), and (D2) it\nis false if it signifies otherwise than is the case (aliter quam\nest). Note the absence of the \u2018only\u2019 in the criterion\nfor falsehood. Truth therefore, is more demanding than falsehood. In\norder for a proposition to be true, all of what it signifies\nto be the case must in fact be the case; if any of what it\nsignifies to be the case fails to be the case, the\nproposition is false. He will then argue that insolubles signify more\nthan at first appears, and that not everything they signify can be the\ncase. Consequently, they are simply false.\n\nThus what is most distinctive in Bradwardine\u2019s theory is his\n\u201cmultiple-meanings\u201d theory of signification. For him,\npropositions signify many things, not in the sense of being ambiguous,\nbut as requiring a multitude of conditions to be satisfied for their\ntruth. For example, \u2018Some man is running\u2019 signifies not\nonly that a man is running, but also that there is a man, and a\nrunner. Indeed, Bradwardine claims that a proposition signifies\neverything which follows from it. This is his famous second postulate,\n(P2). There is considerable controversy over its correct\ninterpretation (for a careful discussion, see Dutilh Novaes 2009:\n\u00a71). (P2) is interpreted by Spade (1981:120) as what he calls\n\u201cBradwardine\u2019s Principle\u201d (BP):\n\n\nIf p only if q, then P signifies that\nq,\n\n\nwhere the name replacing \u2018P\u2019 names the sentence\nreplacing \u2018p\u2019. However, he concedes that, when read\nin this way, the principle does not support the proof Bradwardine\ngives of his second thesis, (T2), which we will discuss below.\nAccordingly, Spade attributes a further principle to Bradwardine, the\n\u201cConverse Bradwardine Principle\u201d\n (CBP):[19]\n\n\nWhatever a sentence signifies follows from it. If P signifies\nthat q, then p only if q.\n\n\nHowever, he admits that Bradwardine never states or mentions this\nprinciple, and that with it, Bradwardine\u2019s solution\ncollapses.\n\nIt is claimed in Read 2009 that (P2) should be interpreted more\ngenerously, not in terms of how it is actually stated by Bradwardine,\nbut how it is actually used by him. As used, it is a closure\nprinciple, that a proposition signifies everything which follows from\nwhat it signifies. This arguably has (BP) as a consequence, but is\nstronger than it, and sufficient for Bradwardine\u2019s proof of\n(T2).\n\nBradwardine\u2019s solution to the insolubles is stated in his second\nthesis, (T2): \u201cEvery proposition which signifies that it itself\nis not true, or is false, also signifies that it is true and is\nfalse\u201d. The proof has four stages (Bradwardine B-I\n\u00a76.6.1\u20136):\n\nsuppose first that a signifies that a is not true,\nand nothing else. If a is not true, then by (D1) it does not\nsignify only as is the case, so it is not the case that a is\nnot true (since we are supposing that is all it signifies), that is,\na is true. So if a is not true, it is true. But a\nsignifies that a is not true, so by (P2) a signifies\nthat it is true. Thus a does not and cannot signify only that\na is not true.\nSo suppose that a signifies that a is not true and\nalso that b is c. If a is not true, then by (D1)\nit does not signify only as is the case, so it is not the case that\na is not true and b is c, that is, either\na is true or b is not c, by (P4), a statement of\nthe De Morgan Laws. So again by (P2), a signifies either that\na is true or b is not c. But a signifies\nthat b is c, so by (P5), Disjunctive Syllogism, and (P2)\nagain, a signifies that a is true.\nsuppose that a signifies that a is false. Then by\n(P1), Bivalence, and (P2), a signifies that a is not\ntrue, so by (1) and (2) above, a signifies that a is\ntrue.\nso by steps 2 and 3, if a signifies that a is not\ntrue or that a is false, a also signifies that a\nis true. But a cannot be both true and false. So things cannot\nbe only as a signifies, so by (D2) a is false.\n\n\nIn the subsequent chapter, Ch. 7, Bradwardine considers the problem of\nrevenge in various guises. (See, e.g., the entry on the\n Liar paradox,\n and especially the section on\n Expressive power and \u2018revenge\u2019.)\n Take Socrates\u2019 utterance of \u2018Socrates utters a\nfalsehood\u2019, where Socrates utters nothing else.\nBradwardine\u2019s claim is that Socrates\u2019 utterance is false,\nthat is, that Socrates utters a falsehood. How can Bradwardine\u2019s\nclaim that Socrates utters a falsehood be true, while Socrates\u2019\nutterance of the same thing is false? The reason, Bradwardine replies,\nis that Socrates\u2019 utterance is self-referential, and signifies\nnot only that Socrates\u2019 utterance is false but also, by (T2),\nthat it is true (and so is false), whereas Bradwardine\u2019s\nutterance is not self-referential (rather, it refers to\nSocrates\u2019 utterance) and so not subject to (T2).\n3.2 Walter Segrave\n\nWalter de Segrave (or de Sexgrave) was at Merton College, Oxford from\n1321 until at least 1338, and had obtained his Magister Artium by\n1336. From 1340\u201342 he was Chancellor to Richard Aungerville, that is,\nRichard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, who famously gathered around him\nsome of the very best minds in the kingdom, including Walter Burley,\nThomas Bradwardine and Richard Kilvington. Segrave subsequently became\nDean of Chichester, but was dead by 1349. His Insolubles is\nhis only known work, which appears to have been composed at Oxford in\nthe late 1320s or early 1330s, which is consistent with the fact that\nit is clearly a response to Bradwardine\u2019s own\nInsolubles. (See Spade 1975 item LXVIII) \n\nSegrave shares many assumptions with Bradwardine, indeed, at a couple\nof points he appears to endorse Bradwardine\u2019s second postulate\n(P2), that a proposition signifies everything implied by what it\nsignifies. For the heart of Segrave\u2019s solution is that, since\nwhoever asserts a proposition asserts that it is true, the restriction\non supposition that Segrave maintains is that \n\nThe extremes of a proposition only supposit for those things for which\nthe whole can mean that it itself is true, assuming that it exists,\nand those extremes do not supposit for such things for which the\nwhole, assuming that it exists, would mean that it itself is false.\nAnd this is my main point.\n The reason Segrave gives is that\n\n\n... it is because the extremes take their supposition from the copula,\nwhose significate is that the proposition is true, as was said, so the\nextreme does not supposit for anything for which the whole would mean\nthat it itself is false or is not true, because this would be\ninconsistent with the significate of the copula, and so the extremes\nare restricted by the meaning of the copula.\n He cites the authority of Aristotle in\nMetaphysics \u0394 7:\n\n\nEvery proposition means things to be in reality as it signifies. This\nis self-evident and is clear from the Philosopher and the Commentator\n[that is, Averroes] in comment 14 on the fifth book of the Metaphysics\nand in the explanation in that comment as a whole: for the copula in\nthe proposition signifies it to be a truth, as is elucidated there.\n\n\nBurley and Bradwardine agree on one thing: that insolubles commit the\nfallacy (simpliciter et secundum quid), taking this from\nAristotle\u2019s treatment in his De Sophisticis Elenchis of\nthe example of the man who swears that he is forsworn. Segrave says\nthey are mistaken: according to him, insolubles commit the fallacy of\naccident. \n\nThe fallacy of accident is the first of the fallacies described by\nAristotle in De Sophisticis Elenchis as those\n\u201cindependent of language,\u201d and discussed at some length in\nch.24. The classic example is the Hidden Man puzzle: you know your\nfather (or Coriscus), your father (or Coriscus) is the man\napproaching, but you don\u2019t know the man approaching (since he is\nwearing a mask, or too far away to recognise, etc.). Aristotle\u2019s\ndiagnosis was that one or more of the two properties attached to\nCoriscus (being known by you and being the man approaching) is\naccidental (or incidental) to him and so there is no essential\nconnection to support inferring the conclusion from the premises. \n\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the fallacy of accident is neither\nclear nor convincing. One medieval attempt to clarify the fallacy of\naccident is found in Giles of Rome. The fallacy arises, he said, when\nthere is a variation in the supposition of the middle term. Burley\nextends the idea of variation of the supposition of terms to the\nextremes (Burley,  Tractatus super librum Elenchorum, cited\nin Ockham 1979, p.231 n.3):\n\nIn this fallacy there should be assigned three, namely, the attribute,\nthe accident and the subject thing. And according to Giles, the major\nextreme is always the attribute and the middle term the subject thing\nand the minor extreme the accident. But this is not a big worry, for\nit suffices for there to be this fallacy that some term is not\nincluded but is compared to two other terms in the argument. Whence it\nshould be realised that the fallacy of accident sometimes results from\na variation of the middle term and sometimes from a variation of the\nmajor or minor extreme.\n Accordingly, Segrave\u2019s analysis appeals to the\nfallacy of accident:\n\n\nInsolubles commit the fallacy of accident because by arguing like\nthis:\n\n\nThis is said by Socrates and this is a falsehood, so a falsehood is\nsaid by Socrates,\n the term \u2018falsehood\u2019 supposits in the minor\npremise for something it does not supposit for in the conclusion.\nSimilarly, in arguing like this:\n\n\nNo falsehood is said by Socrates, this is a falsehood, so this is not\nsaid by Socrates,\n there is a variation in the middle term because the term\n\u2018falsehood\u2019 supposits for one thing in the major premise\nand another in the minor, according to those advocating this solution.\nAnd thus it is clear that they have to solve these kinds of\nparalogisms according to the fallacy of accident, namely, from a\nvariation of the middle term or of an extreme term.\n\n3.3 Roger Swyneshed\n\nSometime between roughly 1330 and 1335, the English Benedictine Roger\nSwyneshed adopted a theory in some respects reminiscent of\nBradwardine\u2019s, but with interesting features of its own. Like\nBradwardine, Swyneshed held that for a proposition to be true, it is\nnot enough that it \u201csignify as is the case\u201d. But whereas\nBradwardine maintained that in addition the proposition must not\nsignify otherwise than is the case (that is, it must signify\nonly as is the case), Swyneshed said that in addition the\nproposition must not \u201cfalsify itself\u201d. Propositions that\nfalsify themselves are said to be those that are \u201crelevant\n(pertinens) to inferring that they are false\u201d. Thus\nwhere Bradwardine amended the account of both signification and\nconsequently of truth, Swyneshed amended only the account of truth.\nInsolubles do falsify themselves, and so are false for that reason,\neven though they signify as is the case.\n\nThe notion of \u201crelevance\u201d clearly relates to the theory of\nObligationes (q.v.). Much of Bradwardine\u2019s,\nSwyneshed\u2019s and Heytesbury\u2019s treatises uses the\nterminology of\n Obligationes-treatises.[21]\n But the main historical interest of his theory does not lie there.\nRather, it lies in three famous and controversial conclusions he drew\nfrom his principles:\n\nSome false propositions signify as is the case. Insolubles\n do.[22]\n Thus, where a is the insoluble \u2018a is\nfalse\u2019, a is self-falsifying and so false. But it\nsignifies as is the case (namely, that it is false).\nIn some valid formal inferences, falsehoods follow from truths.\nFor consider the inference \u201cThe conclusion of this inference is\nfalse; therefore, the conclusion of this inference is false\u201d.\nThe premise and the conclusion of this inference are not only two\ntokens of the same type, but more importantly say the same thing about\nthe same thing, so, Swyneshed claimed, the inference is a formally\nvalid one. (Bradwardine and Buridan would both disagree.) But while\nthe conclusion is a self-falsifying insoluble, and so is false, the\npremise is not self-falsifying, and is in fact true.\n(The conclusion of the inference is false, on\nSwyneshed\u2019s account, because it falsifies itself.) Here then, a\nfalsehood validly follows from a truth.\nIn the case of insolubles, two mutually contradictory propositions\nare false at the same time. Where a = \u2018a is\nfalse\u2019, a is insoluble and false. But its contradictory,\n\u2018a is not false\u2019, Swyneshed claims, is\nnot insoluble and is not self-falsifying. Nevertheless, it is\nfalse because it signifies otherwise than is the case. The insoluble\na really is\n false.[23]\n\n\nMany authors found these conclusions ridiculous, especially the second\nand third ones. But they had their defenders as\n well.[24]\n\nSwyneshed explicitly considers a situation where a =\n\u2018a does not signify as is the case\u2019, and says that\na is neither true nor false in that situation. This is the only\nknown case of a medieval author\u2019s actually allowing failure of\nbivalence for insolubles, even though several authors refer to (and\nreject) such\n theories.[25]\n3.4 William Heytesbury\n\nIn 1335, the Mertonian logician and philosopher of nature William\nHeytesbury wrote an important treatise entitled Rules for Solving\nSophisms (Regulae solvendi\n sophismata).[26]\n The first of its six chapters is on insolubles. The Rules as\na whole, and this first chapter in particular, were widely read and\ncommented on, particularly in Italy in the late-fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries (see, e.g.,\n Section 4.4\n below). Indeed, Heytesbury\u2019s theory is a competitor to\nBradwardine\u2019s as the most influential theory of insolubles in\nthe whole of the Middle\n Ages.[27]\n\nHeytesbury treated insolubles as paradoxical only with respect\nto certain assumed circumstances (what he calls the\ncasus or \u201cscenario\u201d). For example, the\nproposition \u2018Socrates is uttering a falsehood\u2019 is not\nparadoxical in the abstract, all by itself, but only in contexts\nwhere, say, it is Socrates who utters that proposition, the\nproposition is the only proposition Socrates utters (it is\nnot an embedded quotation, for instance, part of some larger statement\nhe is making), and where his proposition signifies just as it normally\ndoes. Spoken and written language are thoroughly arbitrary, for\nmedieval authors, so that the vocal sequence or inscription\n\u2018Socrates is uttering a falsehood\u2019 could theoretically\nsignify any way you want. It might, for example, signify that 2 + 2 =\n4, in which case it would not be insoluble at all but\nstraightforwardly true.\n\nIt is the last condition that is the focal point for\nHeytesbury\u2019s attack. He holds that in the casus where\nSocrates himself says just \u2018Socrates is uttering a\nfalsehood\u2019 and nothing else, his proposition cannot, on\npain of contradiction, signify just as it normally does\n(precise sicut verba communiter pretendunt, as he puts it).\nIf it does signify as it normally does, it must signify some other way\nas well.\n\nHow else might it signify? Heytesbury did not think it was up to him\nto answer that question, as Bradwardine had. The proposition\u2019s\nadditional signification cannot be predicted, given the arbitrariness\nof spoken and written language. Depending on what else it signifies,\ndifferent verdicts about the proposition are appropriate. In short,\nHeytesbury\u2019s strategy is to say,\n\n\nYou tell me exactly what Socrates\u2019s statement\nsignifies, and I\u2019ll tell you first of all whether the case you\ndescribe is possible, and if it is, I\u2019ll tell you whether his\nstatement is true or false.\n\n\nThis \u201cshift the burden\u201d strategy is a consequence of the\nfact that Heytesbury, even more than Bradwardine and Swyneshed, views\nthe question of insolubles in the context of obligationes, a\nhighly formalized medieval disputation context that is a subject of\nmuch recent\n discussion.[28]\n But Heytesbury shares one claim at least with Bradwardine: that no\nproposition, in a suitable scenario, can signify only and precisely\nthat it itself is false. It must signify something more than just\nthis. See Heytesbury [H-OI] \u00a750 and Bradwardine [B-I] \u00a7\nA4.3.\n3.5 The Modified Heytesbury Solution\n\nMany later authors felt that Heytesbury had simply sidestepped the\nreal theoretical issue, and went on to stipulate what Heytesbury would\nnot: an insoluble\u2019s \u201cadditional\u201d signification. They\nheld that, in circumstances that make it insoluble, a proposition not\nonly signifies as it normally does; it also signifies that it is\ntrue. This \u201cadjustment\u201d to Heytesbury\u2019s theory\nhas the effect of combining it with the tradition stemming from\n Bradwardine.[29]\n It proved to be an appealing combination. We might call this the\nmodified Heytesbury solution. \n\nThat John of Holland subscribes to the modified view is not\nimmediately obvious, but clear enough when his text is examined\ncarefully. In response to a counter-argument, where A is\n\u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019, he writes (John of Holland\n1985, p.130):\n\nI deny the first inference, namely \u2018A is a falsehood, and\nSocrates says A, therefore Socrates says a falsehood\u2019, because\nit is a fallacy secundum quid et simpliciter. For the\nconclusion signifies many things conjunctively, namely that Socrates\nsays a falsehood and something else (according to some people,\nviz that \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019 is true).\n That parenthetical clause contains the modified\nHeytesbury solution. At this point, John has mentioned it but\nhasn\u2019t yet committed himself to it. But in his response to the\nfourth counter-argument, he writes:\n\n\nI reply that \u2018Socrates does not say a falsehood\u2019 is not\nthe contradictory of the insoluble, because the insoluble is not a\nsingular proposition. Hence it is not necessary that this proposition\ncontradict it. But if one asks, what then is the contradictory of this\ninsoluble, I say that it is \u2018Not-(Socrates says a\nfalsehood)\u2019 signifying disjunctively that either Socrates does\nnot say a falsehood or that \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019 is\nnot true. Then this disjunction is true if one of its parts is,\nnamely: \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019 is not true. And the\nreason is that from the fact that the insoluble signifies\nconjunctively that Socrates says a falsehood and that \u2018Socrates\nsays a falsehood\u2019 is true (at least as many people say), it is\nnecessary that its contradictory is a proposition in which the\nnegation is preposed to the whole.\n That strongly suggests that John of Holland accepts the\nmodified view, and stands significantly in contrast to\nHeytesbury\u2019s view, which refuses to specify what the additional\nmeaning is. But none of those who hold the modified view seems to\noffer any argument, as Bradwardine had done, to show that this\nadditional signification is that the proposition itself is\n true.[20]\n3.6 John Dumbleton\n\nJohn Dumbleton became Master of Arts at Oxford and Bachelor of\nTheology at Paris. He was listed as Fellow of Merton College in 1338\nand was also a founding Fellow of Queens College in 1341. He studied\ntheology at Paris in the mid-1340s, returning to Oxford around 1347:\nhe was listed again at Merton in 1348. His Summa Logicae et\nPhilosophiae Naturalis was left unfinished at his death, probably\nfrom the Black Death in 1349. \n\nDumbleton\u2019s treatise on insolubles constitutes a very small part\nof his long treatise, running to some 400,000 words, entitled\nSumma Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis. It is preserved in\n21 manuscripts, though two omit the first part, on logic. Part I:\nSumma Logicae opens with a short treatise on signification.\nThis is essential for underpinning and defending Dumbleton\u2019s\napproach to the insolubles, for he argues for a version of\ncassatio: insolubles signify in such a way that they fail to\nexpress propositions. The reason for this failure, he says, is that an\nutterance, spoken or written, is a proposition only if it communicates\nsomething from the speaker to the hearer. \n\nDumbleton restricts the word \u2018term\u2019 to spoken sounds and\nwritten marks. Given that they don\u2019t signify naturally, he says,\nwe need \n\n... to explain first in what manner written and spoken terms signify;\nsecondly, in what manner they are imposed to signify; thirdly, in what\nmanner a term is significative of any thing whatsoever at our\npleasure; fourthly, how we come to know terms; and lastly in what\nmanner any thing can be signified by any term.\n Dumbleton\u2019s answer is that a term only signifies\nwhen and insofar as our understanding performs an act which consists\nin calling to mind or remembering the true intention of the thing by\nmeans of the proper intention of the term:\n\n\nA term\u2019s signifying to someone is nothing other than that\nterm\u2019s calling to mind the true intention of something else by\nmeans of the term\u2019s proper intention.\n >\n\n\nThis analysis of the notion of signification leads Dumbleton to the\nfirst conclusion of his treatise on insolubles: \n\nThe first of the conclusions is this: any term signifies only while\nand insofar as there is actual comprehension by it. This conclusion is\nclear like this: no term signifies by its own nature, nor by any\nnature introduced in it by an impositor, but terms only make us\ncomprehend other things; therefore, if a term signifies, it signifies\nonly while and insofar as there is actual apprehension through it.\nMoreover, an intention only signifies while there is actual\napprehension through it, but an intention signifies to us\nnaturally-before and more than a term, and the signification of a term\nderives from the signification of the intention, therefore all the\nmore so does a term only signify in so far as there is actual\napprehension through it.\n\n\nApplied to insolubles, the idea is that, although there is an\nutterance involved which signifies in some way, the order of priority\nresults in a regress whereby its signification is not well founded and\nthe utterance fails to constitute a proposition. So the scenario must\nbe rejected in proposing that the utterance does constitute a\nproposition: \n\nIf one supposes that the proposition \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019, or a similar one, is spoken, call it A, take what is\nexactly comprehended through its subject\u2014about which the\ncoupling is performed in order to produce the proposition\u2014call\nthat B. B is either proposition A or another proposition. Not another,\nbecause then there would not be a composition about the self-same\nproposition, which contradicts the hypothesis. If what is signified is\nA, then A is not the proposition \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019, but this one \u2018\u201cThis proposition is\nfalse\u201d is false\u2019. The inference holds like this: because A\nis a proposition equivalent to one where the subject refers to the\nproposition A itself, which signifies in some way about A\u2014e.g.,\ntake the proposition: \u2018This proposition exists\u2019, call it\nC, referring to \u2018God exists\u2019. C is the same as the\nproposition \u2018\u201cGod exists\u201d exists\u2019\u2014so, in\nthe scenario proposed, to the subject of the proposition\n\u2018\u201cThis proposition is false\u201d is false\u2019 there\nwould then correspond a further proposition and so on ad infinitum.\nAnd because there is successive reference ad infinitum, it follows\nthat it is not fully comprehended.\n The solution presented by Dumbleton here is highly\nreminiscent of that put forward in Ryle 1951, sometimes referred to as\nthe \u201cnamely-rider\u201d solution. The upshot is that\nDumbleton\u2019s solution to the insolubles is part of a broader\nanalysis of linguistic understanding and communication. Indeed, not\nonly do insolubles fail to constitute propositions, so too do many\nother expressions.\n\n3.7 Gregory of Rimini\n\nGregory of Rimini\u2019s main writing was done in Paris in the 1340s.\nAlthough today we know of no text or passage of his that discusses\ninsolubles, there must have been one, because in 1372 Peter of Ailly\ncites Gregory\u2019s theory in some detail and uses it in writing his\nown treatise on insolubles (see Peter of Ailly [P-CI], and\n Section 4.3\n below).\n\nGregory\u2019s view relies on the traditional medieval notion (going\nback to Aristotle\u2019s On Interpretation 1, 16a3\u20135)\nof \u201cmental language\u201d, the \u201clanguage of\nthought\u201d that underlies and is expressed in spoken and written\n language.[30]\n Unlike spoken and written languages, where the signification of words\nand propositions is thoroughly a matter of convention, signification\nin mental language is fixed by nature once and for all, the same for\neveryone. Consequently, propositions in mental language can never\nsignify otherwise than they \u201cnormally\u201d do. It follows that\nan analysis like Bradwardine\u2019s or Heytesbury\u2019s, or the\nmodified Heytesbury solution, according to which insolubles do signify\notherwise than they normally do, cannot be applied to propositions\nformed in mental language. Although neither Bradwardine nor Heytesbury\nseems to have drawn this conclusion, it follows from their theories\nthat insolubles cannot be formulated in mental language.\n\nIn the absence of any text by Gregory on the topic, we cannot be sure\nthat he reasoned like this from Heytesbury\u2019s position. But for\nwhatever reason, he apparently did confine insolubles to spoken and\nwritten language; for Gregory there are no insolubles in mental\nlanguage. An insoluble proposition in spoken or written language\ncorresponds to and expresses not the mental proposition one\nwould normally expect on the basis of the usual linguistic\nconventions, but a complex and non-paradoxical mental\nproposition.\n\nFor example, where a is the spoken or written proposition\n\u2018a is false\u2019, a corresponds to and expresses\nthe conjunction of two mental propositions. The first\nconjunct signifies that a is false. Note that this mental\nproposition is not the insoluble a, since that was in spoken or\nwritten language whereas this proposition is mental. Unlike a,\nthis proposition is not self-referential; it refers instead to\na.\n\nThe second conjunct signifies that the first conjunct is\nfalse. Since the first conjunct signifies that a is false, this\nmeans that the second conjunct amounts to saying that a is\nnot false, but rather true.\n\nOne way, therefore, of viewing Gregory\u2019s theory is to say that\nhe adopted the modified Heytesbury view described in\n Section 3.5\n above, the view that combines Heytesbury with Bradwardine, but that\nGregory then moved that whole analysis into mental language. As in\nHeytesbury\u2019s theory, insolubles for Gregory do not signify just\nas their words normally do\u2014they do not express the mental\nproposition one would expect from the normal linguistic conventions.\nAs in Bradwardine\u2019s theory, insolubles for Gregory do signify\npartly that way (through the first conjunct of the mental\nproposition). But they do not signify precisely that way;\nthey also signify that they are true (through the second conjunct of\nthe mental proposition).\n\nGiven our present knowledge of Gregory\u2019s views, this\nreconstruction must remain speculative.\n3.8 John Buridan\n\nJohn Buridan was another logician of the 14th century\nholding a theory of the insolubles similar to Bradwardine\u2019s and\nthe modified Heytesbury solution. However, there may have been no\ndirect influence. Like Rimini, Buridan also taught at the University\nof Paris, but unlike Rimini, rather unusually remained a teaching\nmaster in the Arts Faculty for his entire career, from the 1320s until\nat least 1358. We can trace the development of his approach to the\ninsolubles from his early Quaestiones Elencorum, dating from\nthe 1330s, and Treatise on Consequences, through his\ncommentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics,\nSophistical Refutations, and Metaphysics, to the\nvarious treatises of the Summulae de Dialectica, which was\nrepeatedly revised over twenty years. His final view is described in\nthe ninth and last treatise of the Summulae, with the\nindependent title Sophismata, in a version from the mid-1350s\n(see Pironet 1993).\n\nBuridan\u2019s early view was that every proposition, not just\ninsolubles, signifies its own truth. This idea, which we have already\nencountered in Segrave and the modified Heytesbury solution, can be\nfound as early as Bonaventure\u2019s Quaestiones disputatae de\nmysterio Trinitatis (q1 a1), composed in the 1250s. Buridan gives\nonly the briefest of arguments for this claim about signification, not\ngrounding it in any principle like Bradwardine\u2019s (P2). He\nwrites, in his early work Questiones Elencorum (Buridan 1994,\np.92):\n\nFor every proposition is affirmative or negative. But each of them\nsignifies itself to be true or at least from each it follows that it\nis true. This is clear first concerning affirmatives, for every\naffirmative proposition signifies that its subject and predicate\nsupposit for the same, and this is for it to be true ... Secondly, it\nis clear concerning negatives, for a negative does not signify that\nthe subject and predicate supposit for the same, and this is for the\nnegative proposition to be true.\n Thus insolubles, which signify their own falsity,\nsignify that they are both true and false, and so are false.\nBuridan\u2019s view on insolubles may have developed out of Girard of\nOdo\u2019s, whose Logica was composed in Paris in the early\n1320s. Girard\u2019s idea was that the Liar paradox, \u2018I say\nsomething false\u2019, has four things wrong with it\n(malitiae), the fourth being that, since it is affirmative,\nit asserts the unity of its subject with its predicate, but its\npredicate (\u2018something false\u2019) denies this (see Giraldus\nOdonis Logica, 396\u20138).\n\n\nHowever, as early as the Treatise on Consequences, Buridan\nthinks this final step, concluding that insolubles are false because\nthey signify that they are both true and false, needs qualification.\nFor he rejects the idea that a proposition is true if things are how\nit signifies, even however it signifies. Things can be, e.g., how\n\u2018No proposition is negative\u2019 signifies, but it cannot be\ntrue (since it is itself negative, and thus falsifies itself when\nformed). Rather, affirmative propositions are true if their terms\nsupposit for the same, negative if they supposit for different things.\nIndeed, he later rejects the suggestion that propositions signify\ntheir own truth. He did so both for ontological reasons, since that\nwould require some kind of propositional meanings (the famous\ncomplexe significabilia\u2014see, e.g., Klima 2009:\n\u00a710.2); and also because that would make every proposition\nmeta-linguistic. Rather, his later theory claims that every\nproposition virtually implies another proposition asserting the truth\nof the first. Then an insoluble like \u2018Socrates utters a\nfalsehood\u2019, uttered by Socrates, is false not because its terms\ndon\u2019t supposit for the same, but because the terms in the\nimplied proposition can\u2019t also do so. Buridan\u2019s solution\nhas been much discussed in recent decades and has been edited and\ntranslated several times (see Buridan [B-S], [B-S2], [B-B], [B-SD],\n[B-SD2]), but it is deeply problematic (see, e.g., Read 2002: \u00a75;\nRead 2006: \u00a76; with a response on Buridan\u2019s behalf in Klima\n2009, \u00a710.5).\n3.9 Albert of Saxony\n\nMuch closer to Bradwardine\u2019s theory than to Buridan\u2019s is\nthat of another Paris logician, Albert of Saxony, who arrived in Paris\nsometime before 1351 and taught there until around 1362. His view of\nthe insolubles is similar to Buridan\u2019s early view, arguing in a\nsimilar way that every proposition signifies its own truth. But there\nis reason to doubt whether Albert was a student or even follower of\nBuridan, for Buridan belonged to the Picardian Nation at the\nUniversity, whereas Albert was in the English (or by then\n\u201cAnglo-German\u201d) Nation, and in general his outlook follows\nthe English logical tradition from earlier in the century. What is\nperhaps most impressive, and enjoyable, about Albert\u2019s treatise\non Insolubles (Albert of Saxony, [AS-I]), the first part of\nthe sixth treatise of his Perutilis Logica (A Really\nUseful Logic), is the extensive list of insolubles treated, and\ntheir variety. For example, we find there a paradox much discussed in\nthe recent literature on paradoxes under the title\n\u2018V-Curry\u2019, closely related to\n Curry\u2019s paradox.\n In fact, in its contemporary form it appears in Dumbleton\u2019s\ndiscussion of the insolubles (see above,\n Section 3.6)\n and in Heytesbury\u2019s Sophismata Asinina ([H-SA}:\nsophism 18, p. 413): consider the inference with sole premise\n\u2018This inference is valid\u2019 and conclusion \u2018A man is\nan ass\u2019. Albert contraposes it, inferring \u2018This inference\nis invalid\u2019 from the premise \u2018God exists\u2019. The text\ntranslated in \u201cInsolubles\u201d ([AS-I]: XIV, p. 368) follows\nthe Venice 1522 edition. As given in [AS-L] (p. 1158), following the\nmanuscripts, the text should read:\n\n\nLet this inference be A, its premise [\u2018God exists\u2019]\nB, and its conclusion [\u2018This inference is invalid\u2019]\nC, and let \u2018this\u2019 indicate the inference itself.\nThen I put forward inference A, and I ask whether inference\nA is valid or not.\n\n[i] If one says that it is valid, then, since its premise is true, it\nfollows that its conclusion is true. And if its conclusion is true,\nthen things are as its conclusion signifies. But the conclusion\nsignifies that inference A is not valid. Therefore, inference\nA is not valid.\n\n[ii] But if one says that inference A is not valid\u2014on the\ncontrary: If inference A is not valid, it is possible that\nB be true while C is false. But that is false, which I\nprove as follows. For if A is not valid, then C is true,\nand so A is valid, since B is not true unless C\nis true. So if A is not valid, A is valid. The premise\n[\u2018If A is not valid then C is true\u2019] is\nclear, for if A is not valid, things are as C signifies,\nbecause C signifies that A is not valid; and,\nconsequently, C is true. The first inference is evident, for in\norder that A be valid it is enough that B cannot be true\nwithout C, if it is formulated. The last inference holds\n\u201cfrom the first to the last\u201d.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, Albert\u2019s argument in [ii] is that if A is\ninvalid, it must be possible for B to be true and C\nfalse. But if A is invalid, C is true. So it is\nimpossible for B to be true and C false. So even if\nA is invalid, it is valid, and so A is valid. But by\n[i], if A is valid it is invalid. So it is\nboth\u2014paradox.\n\nDumbleton\u2019s response to the paradox was to deny that the premise\n(of his version, \u2018This inference is valid\u2019) constitutes a\nproposition, given the regressive reference of its subject\n(\u2018this inference\u2019\u2014which inference?\u2014\u2018this\ninference\u2019, \u2026; see\n 3.6 John Dumbleton).\n Albert\u2019s response, however, in line with his general approach\nto the insolubles, is to agree that his inverted inference is indeed\ninvalid, but to deny that it follows that C (\u2018This\ninference is invalid\u2019) is true, for C signifies more than\njust that A is invalid. Thus the premise (\u2018God\nexists\u2019) can be true without the conclusion being true, and so\nthe inference really is invalid.\n4. The Late Period\n\nThe period of greatest innovation and sophistication in the medieval\ninsolubilia-literature seems to have been the second quarter\nof the fourteenth century. After about 1350, less original work is\nknown. Insolubles continued to be discussed, but it seems that for the\nmost part the theories adopted were variations or elaborations of the\nones already seen. Paul of Venice (1499), writing in about\n1396\u20137, in the final section of his Logica Magna, lists\nfifteen theories in addition to his own, supplementing\nBradwardine\u2019s list of nine with later developments, but most\nfrom before 1350 (see Spade 1973: 82\u20134). This later period is\nnot yet fully researched, however, so it is too early for a clear\nverdict.\n4.1 Marsilius of Inghen\n\nSpade (1980: 6) suggests the Marsilius\u2019s solution to the\ninsolubles derives, like Gregory\u2019s, from Bradwardine\u2019s. It\nis actually more similar to the modified Heytesbury solution and to\nAlbert of Saxony\u2019s. Marsilius\u2019s treatise was written in\nParis, probably in the 1360s, where Marsilius was in the English\nNation. (He may even have overlapped with Albert, before Albert left\nParis in 1362.) Marsilius\u2019s main idea is that every proposition\nhas two significations, a material signification, which is what we\ntake as its normal or ordinary meaning, about things, and a formal\nsignification, which is meta-linguistic, affirmative propositions\nsignifying that their subject and predicate supposit for the same\nthing, negatives that they don\u2019t. The consequence is that\ninsolubles falsify themselves. Take \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019, for example. Its material signification contradicts its\nformal signification, for its material signification is that\nit\u2019s false, that is, that its predicate does not apply to its\nsubject (that is, to itself), whereas, being affirmative, its formal\nsignification is that its predicate does apply to its subject. So,\nMarsilius concludes, every proposition signifying itself to be false\nfalsifies itself\u2014in being self-contradictory, not in\nSwyneshed\u2019s sense of that phrase. \n\nBut Marsilius rejects the rather simple-minded proof that we noted\nBuridan and Albert give that every proposition asserts or signifies\nits own truth. For that proof turned on the assumption that every\naffirmative (resp. negative) proposition is true if its subject and\npredicate supposit (resp. don\u2019t supposit) for the same thing, by\nthe definition of truth. But insolubles are an immediate\ncounterexample to this. As just noted, \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019 is false (since it falsifies itself), and so its subject\nand predicate do supposit for the same thing. Indeed, \u2018This is\nfalse\u2019 says that \u2018This is false\u2019 is false (rather in\nthe way Gregory\u2019s second mental proposition said that the first\nmental proposition was false) and so, in saying that it\u2019s false\nthat it\u2019s false, its formal signification is that it\u2019s\ntrue. It\u2019s implicitly contradictory and so false. \n4.2 John Wyclif\n\nPerhaps one of the genuinely new theories to emerge from this late\nperiod is that of John Wyclif, who wrote a Summary of\nInsolubles (Summa insolubilium),\n [31]\n probably in the early 1360s, and included another discussion of\ninsolubles in his Continuation of the Logic (Logicae\ncontinuatio), III.8. The theory is essentially the same in the\ntwo treatments.\n\nFor Wyclif, the key to resolving insolubles is to recognize various\nsenses in which propositions can be true or false. There are three\nmain senses of \u2018true\u2019, and accordingly of\n\u2018false\u2019:\n\nIn the transcendental sense, truth is convertible with being, so\nthat any proposition is true in this sense, no matter what it\nsignifies. This sense can be disregarded in discussing insolubles.\nNothing (that is, no being) is false in the sense that it fails to be\ntrue in this sense.\nIn a second sense, a proposition is true if and only if what it\n\u201cprimarily signifies\u201d exists. These \u201cprimary\nsignificates\u201d are neither substances nor accidents, but rather\n\u201cbeings of reason\u201d. It is perhaps plausible to interpret\nan existing primary significate as analogous to a \u201cfact\u201d\nin the modern philosophical sense. A proposition is false in this\nsecond sense if and only if its primary significate fails to\nexist.\nIn a third sense, a proposition is true if and only if what it\nprimarily signifies exists and is independent of the\nproposition itself. It is false in this third sense if and only if its\nprimary significate either fails to exist or else exists but depends\non the proposition itself.\n\n\nThe \u201cindependence\u201d required by the third kind of truth is\nan obscure and difficult matter. But here is how it applies to\ninsolubles:\n\nWhere a = \u2018a is false\u2019, its primary\nsignificate either exists or does not. If it does, then in any event\nit is not independent of a in the sense required by the third\nkind of truth. In either case, then, a will be false\nin the third sense. If the word \u2018false\u2019 in a is\ntaken in the second sense, therefore, a\u2019s primary\nsignificate does exist, since it is a fact that a is false in\nthe third sense. In short, the insoluble is true in the second sense,\nbut false in the third sense.\n\nOur present understanding of Wyclif\u2019s theory does not go much\nbeyond this. Many questions and problems remain. For instance, if the\nword \u2018false\u2019 in a is not taken in the third sense\nbut in the second, the paradox seems to emerge all over again\nin a form that cannot be handled by this theory.\n\nWhatever its virtues or defects, Wyclif\u2019s theory had some\ninfluence on later authors. Robert Alyngton\u2019s own\nInsolubilia, for instance, from around 1380, explicitly\nappeals to Wyclif\u2019s theory. Its influence can also be seen in\nPeter of Mantua\u2019s account (see\n Section 4.4\n below) and in an anonymous late treatise preserved in a Prague\nmanuscript (see Wyclif [W-SI]: xxiv\u2013xxv.)\n4.3 Peter of Ailly\n\nAs already mentioned\n (Section 3.7\n above), in 1372 the Frenchman Peter of Ailly (Petrus de Alliaco)\nwrote an Insolubilia that preserves all we know of Gregory of\nRimini\u2019s theory. Peter\u2019s theory looks much like\nGregory\u2019s. Nevertheless, he did not accept Gregory\u2019s view\nentirely. Whereas for Gregory, an insoluble in spoken or written\nlanguage corresponds to or expresses a conjunction of two\npropositions in mental language, for Peter it corresponds to or\nexpresses two distinct mental propositions, not their\nconjunction. The two distinct mental propositions are the same two\nthat Gregory had conjoined.\n\nIn medieval semantics, propositions that correspond to two distinct\nmental propositions are ambiguous or equivocal. (Indeed, that is the\nmedieval account of equivocation.) Thus, for Peter,\ninsolubles in spoken or written language are strictly equivocal and do\nnot have a single signification. In one sense (answering to the first\nof Gregory\u2019s conjuncts), they are true; in another sense\n(answering to Gregory\u2019s second conjunct), they are false. By\ncontrast, for Gregory, insolubles are just false, not ambiguous at\nall; they correspond to a single false conjunction, one\nconjunct of which is true and the other false.\n\nPeter\u2019s theory has the phenomenological advantage that it\naccounts for the psychological \u201cflip-flop\u201d sense we have\nwhen thinking about insolubles. When we look at them one way they seem\ntrue; when we look at them another way, they seem false. No other\nmedieval theory seems to account for this psychological fact. For\nfurther discussion, see Dutilh Novaes 2008a: \u00a73.8.\n4.4 Peter of Mantua\n\nStrobino 2012 contains the first significant discussion of Peter of\nMantua\u2019s account of insolubles in modern times. Mantua\u2019s\ntreatise, composed in the early 1390s, shows influences from Albert of\nSaxony and William Heytesbury (whose opinions he criticises\nextensively) and of Wyclif\u2019s theory. Mantua\u2019s theory is\nalso mentioned in Paul of Venice\u2019s Logica Magna, in\naddition to the fifteen theories Paul specifically enumerates. Once\nagain, the theory frames itself in Aristotelian terms, whereby the\ninsolubles are absolutely or unqualifiedly false, but true in a\ncertain respect. Like Wyclif\u2019s, his main notion of truth\n(Wyclif\u2019s third, Mantua\u2019s second) requires that\npropositions not be self-referential. If they are self-referential,\nthey are false in this sense. But Mantua\u2019s other notion (similar\nto but narrower than Wyclif\u2019s second) applies only to\nself-referential propositions that are true according to their primary\nsignification. For example, \u2018This proposition is not true\u2019\nis false in the first sense (since it is self-referential), but true\nin the second sense, because it is self-referential and not true (in\nthe first sense). Strobino (\u00a7 3.4) argues that Mantua\u2019s\ntheory, like Wyclif\u2019s, cannot deal with the problem of revenge,\ne.g., with such a proposition as \u2018This proposition is not true\nin either sense\u2019.\n4.5 Paul of Venice\n\nThe authenticity of the Logica Magna is a matter of some\ncontention. Assuming that Paul was the author, we can find discussions\nby him of the insolubles in at least four works, his Logica\nParva (translated in Paul of Venice 1984 and edited in Paul of\nVenice 2002), his Logica Magna (in the treatise on\n\u2018Insolubles\u2019, in a forthcoming edition and English\ntranslation by Barbara Bartocci and Stephen Read from Paul of Venice\n1499 and the one extant manuscript), in the Quadratura (in at\nleast four of its 200 chapters, Paul of Venice 1493), and in the final\nsophism, no.50, in his Sophismata Aurea (Paul of Venice\n1483). Paul follows two of the leading solutions to the insolubles in\nthe fourteenth century, the modified Heytesbury solution and Roger\nSwyneshed\u2019s, in different works: the modified Heytesbury\nsolution in the Logica Parva and the Quadratura, and\nthat of Swyneshed in the Logica Magna and the Sophismata\n Aurea.[31a]\n\n\nIn the Logica Parva, an elementary pedagogical text, Paul\nclearly follows Heytesbury in accepting an insoluble scenario only if\nit is left open that the insoluble proposition has a secondary or\nadditional signification, but (unlike Heytesbury) specifies that\nadditional signification as asserting its own truth. He spells it out\ntowards the end of ch.6: \n\nIt should be noted that an insoluble has two significates, one exact\n(adequatum) and one principal. The exact significate is a\nsubject-predicate significate similar to the insoluble utterance.\nE.g., the exact significate of \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019\nis Socrates saying a falsehood or that Socrates says a falsehood. But\nthe principal significate is a compound significate, e.g., that\nSocrates says a falsehood and that the proposition is true.\n However, that the solution Paul presents here is not his\nown, that is, not his preferred solution, is made clear at the end of\nthe chapter, where Paul writes:\n\n\nNotice that not everything I have said here, or in other treatises,\nhave I said according to my own view, but partly according to the view\nof others, in order to enable young beginners to progress more easily.\n Paul\u2019s own view, then, is more likely that which\nhe presents in his major treatment of the insolubles, in his\nLogica Magna.\n\n\nPaul devotes the whole of the first chapter of his treatise on\ninsolubles in the Logica Magna to the rejection of fifteen\nother proposed solutions. The treatment can be seen as falling into\nfour groups, the first three groups corresponding to three sources on\nwhich Paul draws: first, he runs rapidly through seven of the eight\nalternative solutions considered by Bradwardine in his treatise, for\nthe most part summarising almost verbatim Bradwardine\u2019s\nown criticism. He then turns to Heytesbury\u2019s criticism of\nalternative solutions, starting with the second of the four solutions\nconsidered by Heytesbury, that of John Dumbleton. (The first one\nHeytesbury rejects is Swyneshed\u2019s, which Paul will himself\naccept.) The next (third on Heytesbury\u2019s list) is\nKilvington\u2019s, and then Paul comes to Bradwardine\u2019s own\nsolution. Thus the first ten solutions considered are all from Oxford,\nor at least, those discussed at Oxford in the two decades from the\nearly 1320s to the early 1340s. With the eleventh solution, Paul turns\nto his third source, namely, Peter of Mantua, the eleventh being\nAlbert of Saxony\u2019s solution, presented at Paris in the early\n1350s, and possibly the same as John Buridan\u2019s own early\nsolution. (However, Marsilius of Inghen, whose solution is not\ndiscussed by Peter or Paul, appears to have distinguished\nAlbert\u2019s solution from Buridan\u2019s early view: see Spade\n1975, 79.) Albert\u2019s is the first view discussed by Mantua. Next\ncomes Heytesbury\u2019s (Mantua\u2019s second) solution. Before\nproceeding to the third solution discussed by Mantua, Paul considers\nPeter of Ailly\u2019s solution at some length, seemingly drawing\ndirectly on Ailly\u2019s own treatise, to the discussion of which\nPaul appends (without distinguishing it by number) a criticism of\nMantua\u2019s solution. Finally, Paul turns to a rejection of\nrestrictivism, the first solution rejected by Bradwardine and the\nthird by Mantua. But Paul deals with the specific form given to it by\nWalter Segrave (see\n Section 3.2).\n \n\nAfter this extended discussion of alternatives (occupying a quarter of\nhis treatise), Paul sets out to develop his own solution, based firmly\non Roger Swyneshed\u2019s proposals from the 1330s. In his second\nchapter, he systematically lays out his distinctions\n(divisiones) and assumptions (suppositiones), then\ndraws seven Conclusions and seven Corollaries. The basic idea is\nSwyneshed\u2019s, namely, to provide a solution which does not depend\non postulating tacit or hidden or consequential significates for\ninsoluble propositions beyond what is clearly shown---what they\nstandardly suggest or indicate by the straightforward combination of\ntheir parts (in Heytesbury\u2019s phrase, \u201c sicut termini\ncommuniter pretendunt\u201d). Instead, as Swyneshed had\nproposed, Paul tightens the criterion for truth, to exclude those that\nfalsify themselves, weakening the criterion for falsehood to admit\nthose examples that do falsify themselves even if otherwise\nimpeccable. Roger\u2019s second and third notorious Conclusions\nreappear as Paul\u2019s fifth and second respectively. Paul will\nlater describe the second Conclusion as a fundamental principle:\n\nI deny the inference: \u2018The contradictory of A is false,\ntherefore A is true,\u2019 since in the case of insolubles I uphold\nas a fundamental principle that two mutually contradictory\npropositions may both be false.\n Consequently, Paul defines an insoluble as a\nself-falsifying proposition:\n\n\nAn insoluble proposition is a proposition having reflection on itself\nwholly or partially implying its own falsity or that it is not itself\ntrue, such as \u2018This is false,\u2019 \u2018This is not\ntrue,\u2019 referring to themselves, and \u2018This is true,\u2019\nreferring to its contradictory. And so on for many other examples\nwhich can be identified on the basis of what has been said. Therefore\ninsolubles are self-falsifying propositions.\n\n\nIn the rest of the treatise, Paul considers, in ch.3, the objections\nwhich Heytesbury had directed at Swyneshed\u2019s solution, many of\nwhich had already been addressed in discussing the Conclusions and\nCorollaries in ch.2; shows at some length, in ch.4, how his solution\ndeals with the much-discussed example where Socrates only says\n\u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019; extends the account, in ch.5,\nto deal with other examples, such as that where Socrates says that his\nsole business is to be hung on the gallows, which are not obviously\ninsolubles until the background scenario is added; in ch.6 to examples\nlike \u2018A falsehood exists\u2019 which become insoluble in a\nsuitable scenario; and in ch.7 to examples involving exclusive and\nexceptive propositions, such as \u2018Only a false proposition is\nexclusive\u2019 (assuming it is the only exclusive proposition) and\n\u2018No proposition except A is false\u2019 (where this is A and is\nthe only exceptive proposition). \n5. Observations\n\nSeveral instructive observations can be made about the medieval\ninsolubilia-literature.\n\nFirst, although this article has focused on Liar-type paradoxes, and\nalthough the medieval literature did too, it also included other kinds\nof puzzles. For example (the \u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019\nparadox), where a = \u2018b is false\u2019 and\nb = \u2018a is false\u2019, no Liar-type paradox\narises; contradiction can be avoided by simply taking one of the two\npropositions as true and the other as false. But medieval logicians\nregarded such cases as problematic because they require us to assign\ndifferent truth values to propositions that are semantically exactly\nalike; there is no reason to pick a as the true proposition\nrather than b or conversely (see Read 2006). Cases like this,\nwhich violate only a kind of semantic \u201cprinciple of sufficient\nreason\u201d, were often included under the heading\n\u201cinsolubles\u201d (for example, Buridan, Sophismata\nVIII.8). A variety of epistemic and pragmatic puzzles were often\nincluded as\n well.[32]\n There was rarely any attempt, as is usual in present-day literature\non the paradoxes, to ignore all the inessentials and focus in on a\nsingle paradigmatic case that gets at the kernel of the issue. For\nmedieval authors, the issue was a broad one. Many did not attempt to\ngive any precise and rigorous characterization of what it takes to be\nan insoluble. Often, the definitions they did give are quite general\nand include much more than Liar-type paradoxes. In contrast,\nBradwardine\u2019s definition is precise: an insoluble is \u201ca\ndifficult paralogism secundum quid et simpliciter arising\nfrom some [speech-] act\u2019s reflection on itself with a privative\ndetermination\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: \u00a72.1).\n\nSecondly, medieval authors did not have any sense of theoretical\n\u201ccrisis\u201d over insolubles, as modern discussions of the\nparadoxes often do. The medievals did not regard the paradoxes as\nthreatening the very foundations of reasoning. On the contrary, most\nauthors seem to have regarded them as merely argumentative nuisances,\nand their main concern was to come up with a way of dealing with them\nwhen they arose in disputation. No doubt this difference from the\nreaction to the logical paradoxes in modern logic is due to the\ndifferent contexts in which the discussions emerged. Modern logic is a\nformalized, systematic discipline, closely tied to the foundations of\nmathematics; medieval logic, by contrast, was much looser and informal\n(which of course is not to say it lacked insight), much more tied to\nthe give and take of live academic disputation.\n\nThirdly, and related to the second point, most medieval authors\nthought it was entirely feasible to find a completely satisfactory\n\u201csolution\u201d to insolubles. Insolubles were regarded as\nresting on a straightforward but pernicious fallacy, although authors\ndisagreed over just what the fallacy is. William of Ockham, for\ninstance, writes,\n\n\nAs for insolubles, you should know it is not because they can in no\nway be solved that some sophisms are called insolubles, but because\nthey are solved with difficulty. (Ockham [O-SL]: III-3,\n46)\n\n\nOne medieval author who is known to have departed from this confident\nview is William Heytesbury, who raises objections against his own\nview, and then remarks (Heytesbury [H-OI]: 45, emphasis added):\n\n\nMany objections of this sort can be raised against this view, which it\nwould be difficult or impossible to answer to complete\nsatisfaction.\n\n\nAgain, about his own view he says (p. 21, emphasis added):\n\n\nI do not claim that it or any [opinion] is altogether satisfactory,\nbecause I do not see that this is possible. Nevertheless I\nrate this one among all of them to be nearer the truth.\n\n\nRichard Lavenham, an English contemporary of Wyclif, perhaps put the\nprevailing optimism best (Spade 1975: 93; Heytesbury [H-OI]: 8):\n\n\nJust as the bond of love is sometimes called insoluble, not because it\ncan in no way be untied (sit solubilis) but because it can be\nuntied [only] with difficulty, so a proposition is sometimes called\ninsoluble, not because it is not solvable but because it is solvable\n[only] with difficulty.\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature in Translation", "Primary Literature in the Original Languages", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature in Translation": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Albert of Saxony [Albert von Sachsen], [AS-I],\n\u201cInsolubles\u201d, in <em>The Cambridge Translations of\nMedieval Philosophical Texts.
