    "main_text": "The Pervasiveness of Religious Diversity\n1. The Pervasiveness of Religious Diversity\n\nMost religions are theistic in the sense that they posit the existence\nof a personal Supreme Being (God) or set of personal deities, although\nwithin some belief systems normally labeled religions\u2014for\nexample, Buddhism\u2014there is no belief in such a being.\nMonotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam agree\nthat there is a sole God. Polytheistic religions such as Taoism,\nJapanese Shinto, and Chinese folk religion hold that there are\nmultiple deities (gods). While Hinduism typically recognizes many gods\nand goddesses, it is not polytheistic. Those varieties of Hinduism\nthat count these many deities as aspects of a single God can be\nconsidered monotheistic. Other strands of Hinduism are henotheistic,\nworshiping one deity but recognizing many others. While much of what\nfollows is applicable to any theistic religion, the focus will be on\nthe diversity issues that arise predominately in those religions that\nbelieve in a sole personal Supreme Being (God).\n\nWhile there is obviously widespread diversity of thought among these\nmonotheistic religions (theistic systems) on such issues as the\nGod\u2019s nature and character, the relationship between divine control\nand human freedom, the extent to which God unilaterally intervenes in\nour world, and how God would have us live, it is being increasingly\nrecognized that widespread diversity of thought on all these issues\nalso exists just as clearly, and in exactly the same sense, within\nbasic theistic systems. For example, within Christianity, believers\ndiffer significantly on the nature of God. Some see God as\nall-controlling, others as self-limiting, and still others as\nincapable of unilaterally controlling any aspect of reality. Some\nbelieve God to have infallible knowledge only of all that has occurred\nor is occurring, others claim God also has knowledge of all that will\nactually occur, while those who believe God possesses middle knowledge\nadd that God knows all that would actually occur in any possible\ncontext. Some believe the moral principles stipulated by God for\ncorrect human behavior flow from God\u2019s nature or character and thus\nthat such principles determine God\u2019s behavior, while others believe\nthat God acts in accordance with a different set of moral rules than\nthose moral rules given to humans; that for God what is right is\nsimply whatever God does. Some believe that only those who have\nconsciously \u201cgiven their lives to Christ\u201d will spend eternity in\nGod\u2019s presence. Others believe that many who have never even heard\nthe name of Jesus will enter God\u2019s presence, while others yet do not\neven believe subjective immortality (a conscious afterlife) to be a\nreality. Muslims also differ significantly among themselves on these\nsame divine attributes (Aijaz 2015). Consider, for example, the wide\nvariety of Muslim perspectives on such issues as the autonomy of the\nindividual when interpreting the Qur\u2019an, how best to apply core\nIslamic values to modern life, and the status of women. We find\nequally pervasive, significant intra-system diversity in Hinduism\n(Sharma 2011) and Judaism (Shatz 2011).\n\nMoreover, there is also an increasing awareness that the practical\nimport of intra-theistic diversity is just as significant as is that\nof inter-theistic diversity. For most Christians, for instance, the\npractical significance of retaining or modifying beliefs about God\u2019s\npower or knowledge is just as great as retaining or modifying the\nbelief that Christianity is a better theistic explanatory hypothesis\nthan Islam. In fact, as Dennis Potter points out, whether there are\nactually differing inter-theistic perspectives on a given issues often\ndepends on which intra-theistic perspectives we are considering\n(Potter 2013). So both types of diversity will be given equal\nattention in our discussion\n",
