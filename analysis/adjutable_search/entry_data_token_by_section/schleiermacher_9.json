Political and Social Philosophy\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s political and social philosophy is found\nscattered through a considerable number of works from different\nperiods. Its most systematic, though not necessarily most interesting,\nstatement occurs in his lectures on the theory of the state, which\nwere delivered between 1808\u20139 and 1833.\n\nConcerning international politics, Schleiermacher\u2019s fundamental\nposition is thoroughly Herderian: a cosmopolitan commitment to equal\nmoral respect for all peoples in all their diversity. This position is\nalready articulated in On What Gives Value to Life\n(1792\u20133); it is central to On Religion (1799) and the\nSoliloquies (1800), in the form of a commitment to the\nHerderian ideal of \u201chumanity\u201d; and it survives in later\nworks as well (for example, in the 1831 address on Leibniz\u2019s\nidea of a universal language).\n\nConcerning domestic politics: Schleiermacher was always somewhat\nreticent about fundamental constitutional questions (no doubt due to a\ncertain aversion to the state as such, a greater concern to protect\nagainst it than to develop it). To judge from his early enthusiasm for\nthe French Revolution, his republican-democratic model of an ideal\nchurch in On Religion, and his advocacy of the democratic\nnature of the university in Occasional Thoughts on Universities in\na German Spirit, together with an Appendix on One about to be\nFounded (1808), the early Schleiermacher was strongly attracted\nto republicanism and democracy (like Herder and the young Friedrich\nSchlegel). However, his later position\u2014while it still makes\nconsent a conditio sine qua non of any genuine state\u2014is\nmore sympathetic to aristocratic and monarchical forms of government.\nThus in his lectures on the theory of the state from 1829\u201333 he\nargues that whereas smaller and \u201clower\u201d states are\nnaturally democratic, larger and \u201chigher\u201d ones are\nnaturally aristocratic or monarchical.\n\nHowever, Schleiermacher\u2019s domestic politics is more consistently\nradical in another respect: liberalism. (Here again he is probably\nindebted to Herder.) This ideal is already prominent in two works from\n1799: the essay Toward a Theory of Sociable Conduct argues\nthat there should be a sphere of free (by which Schleiermacher means\nespecially: state-free) social interaction, in order to make possible\nthe development and communication of individuality; and On\nReligion argues strongly against state-interference in religion,\nmaking the liberation of religion from such interference a fundamental\npart of its program for developing individualism in religion, and\ndiagnosing some of the worst vices of current religion and churches in\nterms of such interference. This liberalism remains prominent in the\nethics lectures of 1812\u201313, which add to the positions just\nmentioned a proscription of state interference in the universities.\nAnd it is still central to Schleiermacher\u2019s political thought in\nhis (otherwise much more conservative) late lectures on the theory of\nthe state from 1829\u201333, where he argues that the three spheres\nof sociality, religion, and science (e.g., the universities) lie\nbeyond the legitimate power of the state, and notes critically that\nthe current (Prussian) state falls short of this ideal. His Augsburg\nConfession sermons from 1830 are likewise still liberal.\nSchleiermacher has several reasons for this broad liberalism, but one\nof his most fundamental ones lies in the need to free up a domain in\nwhich the basic good of individuality can develop.\n\nSchleiermacher devotes especially close attention to the question of\nreligion\u2019s proper relation to the state (and to other\nsocio-political institutions). As was mentioned, in On\nReligion he indicates two main reasons why religion should be\nliberated from state interference: first, because individualism in\nreligion, the autonomous development of a multiplicity of forms of\nreligion, is valuable; and second, because state-interference corrupts\nthe nature of religion, in particular by attracting the wrong sorts of\npeople into leadership positions within the church (men with worldly\nskills and motives rather than religious ones) and foisting alien\npolitical functions onto religious mysteries such as baptism and\nmarriage. He argues that the true socio-political center of religion\nshould instead be the family\u2014a position that he subsequently\ngoes on to illustrate in Christmas Eve (1806), a work that\ndepicts in a literary way a sort of ideal interweaving of (Christian)\nreligion with family life.\n\nOne especially important and interesting case to which he applied his\ngeneral insistence on the freedom of religion from state-interference\nwas that of Prussia\u2019s Jews. (Once again, Herder had already set\nan example here\u2014by not only developing a very sympathetic\ninterpretation of ancient Judaism but also forcefully criticizing\nmodern anti-semitism.) In an early work on the subject of Jewish\nemancipation in Prussia, Letters on the Occasion of the\nPolitical-Theological Task and the Open Letter of Jewish\nHouseholders (1799), Schleiermacher argues that Jews should\nreceive full citizenship and civil rights, provided only that they\ncompromise in their religious observances to a point that allows them\nto meet their duties to the state and that they give up such\npolitically threatening commitments as those to a coming messiah and\nto their status as a separate nation. He in particular argues that\nJews should not have to resort to the expedient of baptism as a means\nof achieving citizenship and civil rights (as some (Jewish)\ncontemporaries had proposed), on the grounds that this expedient would\nbe detrimental both to the Jews and their religion themselves and to\nChristianity. In the latter connection his main concern is that it\nwould further water down an already rather watery church. But another\nof his concerns is that it would in effect amount to yet more\ninterference by the state in a religious mystery (baptism). It is\nsignificant to note that Schleiermacher adopts this strikingly liberal\nposition concerning the Jews despite himself being rather critical of\nJudaism as religion: in On Religion he argues that\nReimarus\u2019s conception that there are deep continuities between\nJudaism and Christianity is mistaken, and that although Judaism was a\nbeautiful religion in its day it has long since become corrupted and\nis now effectively moribund (unlike vibrant Christianity).\n\nA further important aspect of Schleiermacher\u2019s socio-political\nphilosophy, especially in its earlier phases, is his feminism (in\nwhich he is again influenced by Herder, who was a pioneer in this\narea, but even more so by Friedrich Schlegel). His feminism has\nseveral sides. First, he encourages women to strive for goods that\nhave traditionally been the monopoly of men. For example, in his short\nIdea for a Catechism of Reason for Noble Ladies, he enjoins\nwomen, \u201cLet yourself covet men\u2019s culture, art, wisdom, and\nhonor\u201d. Second, as a special case of this, he encourages women\nto seek sexual fulfillment, and to free themselves from inhibitions\nabout discussing sex. This is one of the central themes of his\nConfidential Letters Concerning Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s\nLucinde (1800). Third, he identifies women as valuable moral and\nintellectual resources for the benefit and improvement of society as a\nwhole. One example of this lies in their natural aversion to the sorts\nof insensitivity and violence to which men are commonly prone, and\ntheir potential for restraining instead of encouraging or permitting\nthese. In this vein the Idea for a Catechism enjoins women,\n\u201cYou should not bear false witness for men. You should not\nbeautify their barbarism with words and works\u201d. Another (less\nmorally urgent and more localized) example, discussed in Toward a\nTheory of Sociable Conduct, concerns the ability of women, due to\ntheir broad education but their freedom from the narrow confines of\nthe professions, to direct social conversation away from limited\nprofessional concerns toward deeper, and more widely shared ones\n(Schleiermacher is thinking here especially of the hostesses of salons\nof the period that he himself attended). Yet another example can be\nfound in an argument that Schleiermacher develops in his ethics\nlectures to the effect that women are by nature more attuned to\nrecognizing and respecting individuality, whereas men are more attuned\nto recognizing and respecting abstract generalizations, and that\naccordingly one of the key functions of marriage is to bring about a\nvaluable blending of these (equally important) intellectual-moral\nqualities in each partner. (It should be noted, however, that\nSchleiermacher in his later years tended to become more conservative\nin his views about women.)\n\nAt the risk of repetition, it is worth underscoring that in its broad\ncosmopolitan concern for other peoples, Jews, and women\nSchleiermacher\u2019s socio-political philosophy was continuing a\nparadigm that was above all the achievement of a single predecessor:\nHerder.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of Schleiermacher\u2019s socio-political\nphilosophy, especially prominent in the works from 1799\u20131800, is\na broad critique of some central modern socio-economic institutions\nand a set of proposals for remedying their harmful effects. (The\nSoliloquies casts this critique in the form of an attack on\nthe self-satisfaction of the Enlightenment very reminiscent of\nHerder\u2019s attack on the same in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory (1774).) Three parts of Schleiermacher\u2019s case are\nespecially interesting: First, in Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct he implicitly criticizes modern division of labor on the\ngrounds that it blinkers people, inhibiting their development of their\nown individuality and their sense for the individuality of others. His\nproposed solution here is the development of a sphere of\n\u201csociability\u201d\u2014that is, a sphere of free conversation\nand social intercourse, in which such one-sidedness can be overcome.\nSecond, in On Religion he criticizes the deadeningly\nrepetitive labor that is typical of modern economies as an obstacle to\nspiritual, and in particular religious, self-development. His proposed\nsolution in this case is mainly an expectation that advances in\ntechnology will free people from the sort of labor in question. Third,\nin On Religion and the Soliloquies he criticizes the\nhedonism, utilitarianism, and materialism of the modern age for\npreventing people\u2019s spiritual and religious self-development.\nHis proposed solution here is primarily the sort of revival of a\nvibrant religious and moral life for which On Religion and\nthe Soliloquies plead.\n\nA final noteworthy aspect of Schleiermacher\u2019s socio-political\nphilosophy is his philosophy of education, a subject with which he\nengaged throughout his career. Especially interesting in this regard\nis a work that he published in 1808 in connection with the plans for\nfounding a new university in Berlin (now known as the Humboldt\nUniversity): Occasional Thoughts on Universities in a German\nSpirit, together with an Appendix on One about to be Founded.\nThis work preceded Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s better known pieces on\nthe same topic, which date from 1809\u201310, and evidently had a\nstrong influence on them. Schleiermacher and Humboldt both write in a\nvery liberal and progressive spirit with only modest differences\nbetween their positions. They thereby not only collectively generated\nthe model of the university that Humboldt actually implemented in\nBerlin and which thereby became the main inspiration of the modern\nuniversity tout court, but also developed many principles on the\nsubject that would still repay serious consideration today (for\nexample, Britain could still learn a lot from them). Among the\nprinciples that Schleiermacher developed and which Humboldt took over\nare: a conception that the university should promote not only\nknowledge but also individuality; a principle that this requires the\ngreatest possible independence of the university from the state\n(something that will ultimately also serve the state\u2019s own\ninterests better); a principle that it also requires that there should\nbe as much freedom as possible within the university for both\nfaculty and students; a principle that students should be admitted to\nuniversity regardless of their class background provided only that\nthey are academically qualified; a principle that philosophy should\nreplace theology as the top faculty; a principle of combining research\nwith teaching; and a principle (based on a philosophy of language that\nSchleiermacher shares with Humboldt according to which language is\nfundamental to thought and moreover oral language is more fundamental\nthan written) that the teaching in question should be primarily oral\nin character (for Schleiermacher the lecture, for Humboldt the\nseminar). Indeed, Schleiermacher is in certain ways even more radical\nand progressive than Humboldt in that he, for example, explicitly\ncalls for the university to be run on a democratic model and\ndemands that students from the lower classes not only be admitted to\nuniversity but also receive financial support from the state in order\nto enable them to attend.\n\nSchleiermacher also gave more general lectures on pedagogy, or the\nphilosophy of education, namely, in 1813\u201314, 1820\u20131, and\n1826\u2014among which those from 1826 are most fully developed.\nHowever, by the time he delivered this last cycle of lectures his\nviews had become much more politically conservative and orthodoxly\nChristian, so that the radical edge of his earlier work on the subject\nwas blunted, the interests of the state and the church were now\nassigned greater weight as goals of education, and such principles as\nfreedom in education accordingly underwent heavy qualification.\n",
