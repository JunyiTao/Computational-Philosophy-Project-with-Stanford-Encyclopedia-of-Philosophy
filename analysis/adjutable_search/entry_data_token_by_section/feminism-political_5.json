Notable among them are the so-called French Feminists,\nnamely Cixous, Kristeva, and Irigaray. Of them all, Irigaray may have\nthe most developed political philosophy, including several books on\nthe rights that should be afforded to girls and women.\nIrigaray\u2019s early work (1974 [1985a] and 1977 [1985b]) made the\ncase that in the history of philosophy women have been denied their\nown essence or identity. Rather, they have been positioned as\nmen\u2019s mirror negation. So that to be a man is to not be a woman,\nand hence that woman equals only not-man. Her strategy in response to\nthis is to speak back from the margins to which women have been\nrelegated and to claim some kind of \u201cessence\u201d for women,\nand, along with that, a set of rights that are specifically for girls\nand women (Irigaray 1989 [1994] and 1992 [1996]). Criticisms of her\nviews have been heated, including among feminists themselves,\nespecially those who are wary of any kind of essentialist and\nbiological conflation of women\u2019s identity. To the extent that\nIrigaray is an essentialist, her view would be relegated to what is\nsometimes called symbolic difference feminism (Dietz 2003). However,\nthere are also compelling arguments that Irigaray is wielding\nessentialism strategically or metaphorically, that she isn\u2019t\nclaiming that women really do have some kind of irreducible essence\nthat the history of metaphysics has denied them (Fuss 1989). This\nother reading would put Irigaray more in the performative group\ndescribed below\n (section 2.8).\n The same kind of argument could be made for the work of Julia\nKristeva\u2014that her metaphors of the female chora, for example,\nare describing the Western imaginary, not any kind of womanly reality.\nSo whether French feminist thought should be grouped as difference\nfeminism or performative feminism is still very much open to\ndebate.\n\nTo the extent that the above two types of feminist theory are\npinpointing some kind of specific difference between the sexes, they\nraise concerns about essentialism or identifying distinct values that\nwomen have as women. Such concerns are part of a larger set of\ncriticisms that have run through feminist theorizing since the 1970s,\nwith non-white, non-middle-class, and non-western women questioning\nthe very category of \u201cwoman\u201d and the notion that this\ntitle could be a boundary-spanning category that could unite women of\nvarious walks of life. (See the entries on\n identity politics\n and\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n Criticisms of a unitary identity of \u201cwoman\u201d have been\nmotivated by worries that much feminist theory has originated from the\nstandpoint of a particular class of women who mistake their own\nparticular standpoint for a universal one. In her 1981 book,\nAin\u2019t I a Woman?: Black women and feminism, bell hooks\nnotes that the feminist movement pretends to speak for all women but\nwas made up of primarily white, middle class women who, because of\ntheir narrow perspective, did not represent the needs of poor women\nand women of color and ended up reinforcing class stereotypes (hooks\n1981). What is so damning about this kind of critique is that it\nmirrors the one that feminists have leveled against mainstream\npolitical theorists who have taken the particular category of men to\nbe a universal category of mankind, a schema that does not in fact\ninclude women under the category of mankind but marks them as other\n(Lloyd 1984 [1993]).\n\nThe question of subjectivity has been a particularly fertile one for\nfeminist political philosophy. Feminist politics and activism,\ninformed by poststructuralist and postcolonial critiques of the\nsubject, have spurred new work that seeks to understand what remains\nof the \u201cfeminist subject\u201d after critiques of essentialism\nand Eurocentrism (Butler 1995; Kramer 2017; Weeks 1998; Zerilli\n2005).\n",
