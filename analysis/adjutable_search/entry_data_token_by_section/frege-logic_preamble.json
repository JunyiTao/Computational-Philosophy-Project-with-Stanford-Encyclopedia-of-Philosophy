    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (b. 1848, d. 1925) is often credited\nwith inventing modern quantificational logic in his\nBegriffsschrift. While there has been some controversy over\nexactly what was novel with Frege, and what can be found in the work\nof contemporaries such as George Boole, Augustus DeMorgan, Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Venn (see, e.g.,\nPutnam 1982 or Boolos 1994 for accounts that resist the tendency to\nattribute all of modern logic to Frege, and also the entry on\n the algebra of logic tradition),\n there is no doubt that Frege\u2019s work\u2014especially as\nchampioned by Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2014had a\nhuge influence on how philosophical and mathematical logic\nprogressed.\n\nWhile this entry is intended to provide the reader with an overview of\nFrege\u2019s logical systems as presented in Begriffsschrift\nand Grundgesetze, it is not intended to be a guide to\ntranslating Frege\u2019s logical systems into modern notation, hence\nthere is very little modern notation in what follows. Despite the\ncommon approach of \u201cinvestigating\u201d various aspects of\nFrege\u2019s logic and his logicist program via a translation of his\naxioms and theorems into modern notation, such an approach can often\nlead to misunderstandings of Frege\u2019s actual views, since his own\nnotation (in both logical systems) differs in significant ways from\nmodern first- and higher-order quantificational logic. As a result,\nanyone who is interested in understanding Frege\u2019s logical and\nphilosophical views on their own terms needs to examine those views in\ntheir native habitat\u2014the logics and formal languages of\nBegriffsschrift and Grundgesetze\u2014and as a\nresult, needs to become fluent in working with Frege\u2019s notation,\ndeductive systems, etc., directly. This entry is, amongst other\nthings, intended as a means to begin that journey.\n",
