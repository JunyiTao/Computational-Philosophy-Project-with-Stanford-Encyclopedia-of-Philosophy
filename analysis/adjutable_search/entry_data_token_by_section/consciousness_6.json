The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness?\n\n\nThe What question asks us to describe and model the\nprincipal features of consciousness, but just which features are\nrelevant will vary with the sort of consciousness we aim to capture.\nThe main properties of access consciousness may be quite unlike those\nof qualitative or phenomenal consciousness, and those of reflexive\nconsciousness or narrative consciousness may differ from both. However,\nby building up detailed theories of each type, we may hope to find\nimportant links between them and perhaps even to discover that they\ncoincide in at least some key respects.\n",
