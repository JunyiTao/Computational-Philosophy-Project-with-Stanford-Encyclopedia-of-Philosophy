    "main_text": "The Significance of Past Wrongdoing || Non-Identity-Problem and Claims to Compensation\n5.1 Non-Identity-Problem and Claims to Compensation\n\nConcerning the first issue the non-identity-problem can be relevant:\nhow can individuals today have a just claim to compensation owing to\nwhat was done to others in the past when the (potential) claimants may\nnot exist today had past people not suffered these harms (Morris 1984;\nKumar & Silver 2004; Kershnar 2004: 70\u201375; Meyer 2004b and\n2013)? For\n example,[16]\n do African Americans, whose ancestors were subjected to the terrible\ninjustices of being kidnapped in Africa and subsequently enslaved,\nhave a just claim to compensation? (See, e.g., Bedau 1972; Boxill 1984\n[1992]; Brooks 1999: parts 6 and 7; Soyinka 1999: 44\u201369;\nFullinwider 2000; Lyons 2004b; Miller & Kumar [eds] 2007) Let us\nset aside a host of specifically legal questions concerning, for\nexample, the statute of limitations and liability. Let us also assume\nthat it is sometimes possible to identify with certainty direct\ndescendants of enslaved people. Consider the case of Robert, who has\nbeen identified as one such person (see Fishkin 1991: 91\u201393).\nPeople can claim compensation for harms they suffered. As a descendant\nof enslaved people, has Robert been harmed owing to the injustices\nsuffered by his ancestors?\n\nFirst, consider briefly the common understanding of harm, namely the\nsubjunctive-historical understanding (see\n \u00a73.1).\n According to this interpretation of harm, a person can be understood\nto be fully compensated for an act or policy (or event) when she is as\nwell off as she would have been had the act not been carried out.\nAccording to this interpretation of harm, it is not the case that\nRobert has been harmed by his ancestors\u2019 having been kidnapped\nand enslaved. If his ancestors had not been kidnapped and enslaved,\nRobert would not exist today. His existence depends on the fact that\nthe genealogical chain was not broken at any point. Hence, the initial\nkidnapping in Africa, the transport to America, and the slavery of his\nancestors are necessary conditions for Robert\u2019s having come into\nexistence at all. He would not have been better off had his ancestors\nnot been badly wronged. Thus, we cannot rely upon this interpretation\nof harm and its accompanying interpretations of compensation in\nclaiming that Robert has been harmed and should be compensated; the\nrequired state of affairs under this interpretation implies the\nnonexistence of the claimant to\n compensation.[17]\n\nTo this claim we can respond in a number of ways. As suggested by our\ndiscussion in\n section 3\n and\n section 4\n we can allow for an identity-independent notion of harm in addition\nto the common identity-dependent notion of harm. Consider the\nthreshold notion of harm at\n (III).\n Under this interpretation of harm, a person can be understood to be\nfully compensated for an act or policy (or event) if that person does\nnot fall below the specified standard. According to this\ninterpretation, Robert can be harmed because his ancestors were\nkidnapped and enslaved. Whether Robert has been harmed due to the way\nhis ancestors were treated depends upon whether the way they were\ntreated has led to Robert\u2019s falling below the specified standard\nof well-being. That this is true in the case of Robert, however, will\nturn on a causal link between the past injustices and his\ncurrent state of well-being. Employing this interpretation of\nharm and its accompanying interpretation of compensation requires a\nforward-looking assessment of what others ought to do today in terms\nof providing compensation for past\n injustice.[18]\n By providing measures of compensation they ought to counteract the\nconsequences of past wrongs in such a way that the indirect currently\nliving and future indirect victims are as well off as they ought to\nbe. When we analyze historical claims on the basis of such a threshold\nnotion of harm, the current (and future) normative relevance of past\nwrongs will depend upon their causal relevance for the well-being of\ncurrently living (and future) generations. Fulfilling our duties to\nboth the latter might well require compensation for the consequences\nthat stem from the fact that their predecessors have been badly\nwronged. That their predecessors were wronged, however, does not in\nitself (independently from its particular consequences) give rise to\njust claims of compensation on the part of their descendants\ntoday.\n",
