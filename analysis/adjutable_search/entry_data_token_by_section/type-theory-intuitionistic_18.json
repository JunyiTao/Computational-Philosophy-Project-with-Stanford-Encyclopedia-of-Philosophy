    "main_text": "Extensions || Iterative Sets and CZF\n4.4 Iterative Sets and CZF\nAn important application of well-founded trees is Aczel\u2019s (1978)\nconstruction of a type-theoretic model of Constructive Zermelo\nFraenkel Set Theory. To this end he defines the type of iterative sets\nas\n\n\\[\\V = \\W x {:} \\U. x.\\]\n\nLet \\(A {:} \\U\\) be a small type, and \\(x {:} A\\vdash M\\) be an indexed\nfamily of iterative sets. Then \\(\\sup(A,x.M)\\), or with a more\nsuggestive notation \\(\\{ M\\mid x {:} A\\}\\), is an iterative set. To\nparaphrase: an iterative set is a family of iterative sets indexed by a small type.\nNote that an iterative set is a data-structure in the sense of\nfunctional programming: a possibly infinitely branching well-founded\ntree. Different trees may represent the same set. We therefore need to\ndefine a notion of extensional equality between iterative sets which\ndisregards repetition and order of elements. This definition is\nformally similar to the definition of bisimulation of processes in\nprocess algebra. The type \\(\\V\\) up to extensional equality can be\nviewed as a constructive type-theoretic model of the cumulative\nhierarchy, see the entry on \n  set theory: constructive and intuitionistic ZF\nfor further information about CZF.\n",
