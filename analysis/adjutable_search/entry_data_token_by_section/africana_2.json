    "main_text": "Africana Philosophy: Continental Africa\n3. Africana Philosophy: Continental Africa\n\n\nThe various peoples on the continent that came to be called\n\u201cAfrica\u201d had constructed a variety of more or less complex\nsocieties of varying scale and scope many generations before fifteenth\ncentury encounters with acquisitive explorers and adventurers from the\nvarying configurations of polities, regions, cities, and states that\nhave been identified as Europe and from elsewhere. Several of these\nancient societies\u2014the kingdoms of Mali and Ghana and the royal\ndynasties of Kemet (Ancient Egypt), for example\u2014had evolved\ncomplex social strata that included persons of accomplished learning.\nSome of these persons were stationed in institutions devoted to the\nproduction and distribution of knowledge and creative expression and to\nthe preservation of that knowledge and expression in written and\nartistic works stored in libraries and other repositories and, in the\ncase of works of art, incorporated into the ontologically-structured\nroutines of daily life. Others, in social orders in which advanced\nknowledge was produced and mediated via oral literatures and\ntraditions, were selected and trained to be griots: that is,\npersons with rigorously structured memories who thus became the living\nrepositories, guardians, and mediators of a people\u2019s and/or a\npolitical community\u2019s genealogies and intellectual legacies,\ntheir keepers of wisdom. And in order to preserve shared, adaptive life\nacross generations in all of the various social orders, it was socially\nnecessary to construct and maintain interpretive orderings of natural\nand social realities, as well of creatively imagined origins and\ngenealogies and constructed histories, by which to meaningfully order\nindividual and shared life.\n\n\nThe production of these interpretive and expressive orderings, the\nworking out of the norms by which to structure, justify, and legitimate\nthe interpretations so as to order personal and social life, were,\nindeed, \u201cphilosophical\u201d endeavors: labors devoted\nto the production of successful, time-tested, enduring thought-praxis\nand aesthetic strategies by which to resolve emergent and recurrent\nchallenges to transgenerational survival and flourishing. These were\nexperience-conditioned thoughtful means by which to provide knowledge\nto guide the ordering of meaningful individual and shared life\ntransmitted across generations past, present, and future. Such efforts\nare as old as the peoples now routinely referred to as\n\u201cAfricans.\u201d And the efforts were not destroyed by the\nholocausts of imperialist colonization and domination, nor by\nracialized enslavement and apartheid-oppression, fostered by Europeans\nand others. Still, the philosophizing efforts were disrupted and\ndistorted to various degrees in many instances, were creatively\nadaptive in many others.\n\n\nFor example, during twentieth century anti-colonial and decolonizing\nstruggles to regain freedom from the domination and authoritative\njurisdiction of white racial supremacy over the lives, lands, and\nresources of African peoples, the disruptions and distortions would\ncompel reinvigorated and determined adaptive creativity on the part of\nAfrican peoples who endeavored to recover and repair old, and/or to\ninvent new, agendas and strategies for living in keeping with their will\nto endure. There is a long history of efforts by scholars African and\nof African descent to reclaim Egypt from the intellectual annexation to\nEurope that was urged by Hegel in his The Philosophy of\nHistory. It is still the case that many people throughout Europe\nand the United States regard Egypt as being in \u201cthe Middle\nEast\u201d rather than as constituting the northern portion of the\nAfrican continent. This costly mis-education of popular imaginations\npersists, as well, in historical accounts of various areas of thought\n(though increasingly less so in historiography related to Africa). The\nsystematic production of ignorance and distorted, unethical\n\u201cknowledge\u201d about the peoples of Continental Africa persists\nin academic Philosophy, especially in the training of new\nprofessionals; in the writing of canonical histories of the discipline;\nand in the construction of disciplinary curricula though progressive\nchange has begun. Few in academic Philosophy not engaged in the work of\nAfricana philosophy are likely to know of a long tradition of\nscholarship contesting the claims of the Greco-Roman\n\u201corigins\u201d of Philosophy, an example of which is the\ncontroversial work by George G.M. James, Stolen Legacy (James 1954), in\nwhich he argues, as the title declares, that Greek thinkers\n\u201cstole\u201d Egyptian intellectual legacies that have since been\nattributed erroneously to Greek thinkers as their creations.\n\n\nA provocative and controversial argument, indeed. Still, widespread\ndisciplinary ignorance regarding the histories of ancient peoples and\ncivilizations other than those stipulated as being ancestors of\nEuropean White peoples is a direct and continuing consequence of racism\nin the formation, organization, and practices of communities of\ndiscourse and scholarship and the development of racially segregated\nidea-spaces, intellectual traditions and networks, and scholarly\norganizations throughout Europe and North America. For example, few\nacademic philosophers and workers in other disciplines who are neither\nAfrican nor of African descent are likely to know of the Association\nfor the Study of Classical African Civilizations, an international\norganization of scholars and intellectuals African and of African\ndescent who are determined to \u201crescue and rehabilitate\u201d the\nhistories, intellectual traditions, and wisdom philosophies of Ancient\nAfrica. Thus, few academic philosophers are likely to know of the\nscholarship of various persons in the Association such as Maulana\nKarenga (1986) and Jacob H. Carruthers (1984). Both scholars have contributed\nadditional research and scholarship to studies devoted to reclaiming\nEgyptian thought-traditions as African traditions of thought.\nThese scholars\u2019 efforts and works are paradigmatic examples of\nthe determined production and mediation of new knowledge of African and\nAfrican-descended peoples by African and African-descended, and other,\nscholars who have deliberately worked independently of the mainstream\norganizations of academic professionals in Philosophy and other\ndisciplines.\n\n\nWith little to no evidence in much of the canonical literature and\ncurricula of academic Philosophy that Western philosophers have focused\nattention on questions of historical relations between Egyptian and\nGreco-Roman thinkers, or on African thinkers and traditions of thought,\na number of the pioneers of Africana philosophy have turned to\nindependent, often controversial figures and scholarly projects outside\nof academic, professional Philosophy for their inspiration and for\nintellectual resources and strategies in taking on the challenges of\ncreating intellectual spaces in academic Philosophy for \u201cmatters\nAfrican.\u201d A major resource and intellectual mentor continue to be\nworks by and the person of Cheikh Anta Diop, the intellectually daring\nand pioneering Senegalese scholar who, in The African Origin of\nCivilization: Myth or Reality, published in the early 1970s,\nargued for the reality of the African origin of human civilization. Diop had begun the\nchallenging work of reclaiming African heritages decades earlier by\narguing in a dissertation submitted for the Ph.D. at the University of\nParis that ancient Egyptian civilization was a black African\ncivilization. His explorations in support of his claims have enormous\nimplications for revisions to histories of the origins of Western\nPhilosophy. Similarly, Martin Bernal\u2019s loudly and heatedly\ncontested multi-volume Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of\nClassical Civilization is by far the most widely read, and\nintensely debated, work in this vein to which many have turned.\nHowever, Bernal\u2019s work, which acknowledges a long line of African\nand African-descended scholars who are his precursors, Diop included,\nhas raised hardly a ripple in academic Philosophy. The discipline has\nthus long been overdue for a spirited and disciplined critical\nreconsideration of the possibilities and realities of informing\nGreco-Roman and African Egyptian contributions to the\nhistories of emergence and development of philosophical thought that\nhas been canonized as foundational to the genealogy of Western\nPhilosophy. Africana philosophy has been forged as a novel context of\nprovocations for such critical reconsiderations.\n\n\nMeanwhile, for several decades academic philosophers in Africa, and\nelsewhere, have been involved in intense debates and discussions that\nhave prompted reconstructions of disciplinary enterprises of Philosophy\n(departments in educational institutions as well as national and\ninternational organizations of professional philosophers). The initial\nfocal question at the center of the debates and discussions was whether\nor not there were proper instances of Philosophy in traditional (i.e.,\npre-Modern) Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular. The publication in 1945\nof Placide Tempels\u2019 La Philosophie Bantoue triggered\nmuch of the debate.\n\n\nThe historical context in which the debates and discussions emerged\nand in which they were waged was conditioned thoroughly by European\ncolonial domination and exploitation of African peoples rationalized\nthrough rank-ordering racial characterizations. This rationalizing work\nwas aided significantly by the intellectual efforts of canonical\nEuropean philosophers. David Hume, in a footnote in his \u201cOf\nNational Characters,\u201d philosophized about the \u201cnatural\ninferiority\u201d of Negroes to White people (Hume 1742) and was supported by\nImmanuel Kant (1764), who elaborated his own theory of inferior and superior\nracial types in his writings on anthropology (Kant 1798). Since successive\ngenerations of European and Euro-American White people had been\neducated into widely-shared common senses of their racial superiority\nto inferior Africans by such supposedly philosophically well-reasoned,\nscience-verified, and theologically sanctioned teachings, the claim\nthat there were Africans capable of producing thought of the caliber of\nPhilosophy was regarded by most of them as utterly preposterous.\n\n\nAt the core of the controversy was the pressing question\nwhether African persons were fully and sufficiently human and capable\nintellectually in comparison to the model human par excellence: the\nman of Europe, the White Man, the avatar for all White people\nand for humanity proper, whose defining characteristics were capacities\nfor reasoning and articulate speech (logos). Consequently, the\nclaim of Bantu Philosophy made by Placide Tempels, a Belgium\npriest engaged in missionary work in the then-called Belgian Congo,\nthat Bantu Africans (related ethnic groups identified by the dominant\nlanguage group, Bantu, spoken by the related groups) had an indigenous\nphilosophy was a serious challenge to the racialized philosophical\nontology-cum-anthropology that undergirded colonial domination and\nexploitation. However, Tempels tempered the unsettling implications of\nhis claim by also claiming that Bantu Africans did not have conscious\nknowledge of their philosophy. Rather, he claimed, it was he who was\nable, using the tools at his disposal by virtue of his training in\nPhilosophy, to engage in a hermeneutic of the practices and language of\nthe Bantu and extract the constitutive epistemology and axiology\nstructuring the operative, behavior-guiding philosophy at work in their\nlinguistic practices and normative actions.\n\n\nNonetheless, the impact of Bantu Philosophy was\nsubstantial. Of particular consequence, the debates it prompted helped\nto direct the attention of researchers and scholars in several\ndisciplines (anthropology, ethnology, history, religion, philosophy) to\nthe identification and exploration of the articulate systems of thought\nof various groups of \u201ctraditional\u201d Africans. A number of\nEuropean scholars and researchers who had spent years studying and\nliving among various African peoples were pleased to find confirmed in\nTempels\u2019 book their own positive assessments of Africans\u2019\nthought-systems, social organization, and artistic creativity. Others,\nhowever, disagreed and challenged Tempels\u2019 claims, in a\nparticular case criticizing him for mistaking an \u201cimpetus\nfor\u201d philosophy in the language and behavior of Bantu-speaking\nAfricans as evidence of a developed capacity for articulating a proper\nPhilosophy. This critic concluded that Bantu-Africans had not yet\nfulfilled the conceptual conditions for \u201ctaking off\u201d into\nphilosophizing properly (Crahay 1965). Other scholars engaged in comparative\nexplorations of thought-systems of various African peoples countered\nthe criticism by providing accounts of a number of such systems that\ngave clear evidence of their very capable and developed\nrationality (Forde 1954; Fortes 1965).\n\n\nThe subsequent decades of debates (mid 1940 through the 1980s)\nregarding the possibility of African philosophy and disclosures of the\nlong-developed rationality and humanity of African peoples were\nsignificant consequences for intellectual agendas and practices of\nrevolutionary developments in political arenas manifested in\nanti-colonial struggles throughout the African continent, and in\nefforts to construct new political, economic, social, and cultural\norders after the successes of those struggles. A significant number\namong new generations of African intellectuals\u2014many of them\neducated in institutions in Africa, many of which were administered by\npersons of European descent; and more than a few of them educated\nfurther in the most elite institutions of the colonizing \u201cMother\nCountry\u201d\u2014became radicalized in their opposition to\nracialized colonial domination and exploitation of African peoples and\nresources. A number of these engaged intellectuals regarded Tempels and\nsimilarly oriented European and Euro-American thinkers as allies in\ntheir struggles against the dehumanizing rationalizations that\nsupported European colonialism. Some regarded Bantu Philosophy\nas a defense, even a vindication, of Africans as rational human beings\nquite capable of managing their own lives and therefore capable of\nindependence from colonial rule. Others, however, thought\nTempels\u2019 claims, and similar offerings by others, were misguided\nand misleading candidates for proper instances of philosophical thought\nby Africans. For these dissenters such candidates were really more\nethnological studies of African peoples than philosophical\narticulations by them, and that their proponents were more\nmisguided in seeming to attribute unconscious, unwritten, and widely\nshared putative philosophical systems to all of the persons in the\nparticular groups under discussion. These dissenters disparaged such\naccounts as \u201cethno-philosophy.\u201d\n\n\nAfrican and African-descended intellectuals involved in and\notherwise supporting anti-colonial liberation struggles and\npost-colonial efforts to rehabilitate and further development new\nAfrican nation-states found in these raging debates intellectual\nweapons with which to reclaim, reconstruct, and redefine the histories,\npersonhood, peoplehood, needs, and future possibilities of African\npeoples. Life under exploitative, dehumanizing colonialism compelled\nintellectual and artistic engagements with prevailing conditions and\nspurred the nurturing of imaginative visions of possibilities of\nliberation and of how liberation might be achieved; whether and how\nmodes and agendas of life before the holocausts might be recovered,\nrestored, or adapted to new circumstances as thinkers and practitioners\nof the religious and theological, creative and expressive artists of\nliterature, music, sculpture, dance, and painting all grappled with the\nprofound existential challenges of the loss of personal and communal\nintegrity through the violent imposition of the conflicts of Tradition\nand Modernity and the need for liberation and freedom.\nTwentieth-century struggles on the African continent have thus had\nsignificant consequences for, and impacts on, creative intellectual and\nexpressive work in and with regard to continental Africa, and the\nAfrican Diaspora generally, in giving rise to widespread, prolific, and\nin many cases especially important articulations of social, political,\nethical, and expressive aesthetic thought and feeling. These\narticulations and expressions have become important object-lessons as\nwell as inspiring resources of agendas and critiques drawn on to forge\ndistinctive disciplinary enterprises of academic Philosophy. They have\nbecome, as well, the focus of informative critical thought for a number\nof philosophers focusing on \u201cmatters African.\u201d\n\n\nFor example, the Tempels-inspired debates over the possibilities for\nand nature of philosophizing by persons African became focused, for a\ntime, on discussions of the nature and anthropological distributions of\nmodes of rationality unique to philosophizing, discussions that quickly\nprompted intense debates about the universality or relativity of\n\u201creason,\u201d whether there were cultural (or racial or ethnic)\ndifferences in the nature or the exercise of reasoning, by persons\nAfrican in particular historical and cultural contexts in particular.\nPositions taken in these and other focal debates were developed from\nthe resources of a variety of traditions and schools of academic\nPhilosophy and other disciplines, including analytic philosophy,\nphenomenology, hermeneutical, and existential philosophizings, various\nmodes of social and political philosophy, and Afrocentrism.\n\n\nToday there are a significant and still growing number of formally\ntrained African philosophers throughout the world who draw on and\ncontribute to the discipline and profession of Philosophy. Explicit\ndevelopments of discursive formations, within and beyond the\ndiscipline, that are distinguished as being \u201cAfrican\u201d have\nbeen unfolding through efforts by persons African, African-descended,\nand not of African descent to identify, reconstruct, and create\ntraditions and repositories of literate African thought and artistic\nexpression\u2014oral, written, and in iconic forms of art\u2014as\nforms of philosophizing. An important development has been the taking\non for serious consideration the expressed articulate thought of\nparticular persons past and present who were and are without formal\ntraining or degrees, in academic Philosophy especially, but who have\nengaged in and articulated more or less systematic reflections on\nvarious aspects of life, and the inclusion of instances and traditions\nof such expressed articulate thought in revised and new canons of\nAfrican philosophical thought. An important leading example of efforts\nalong these lines has been the groundbreaking work of deceased Kenyan\nphilosopher H. Odera Oruka on the philosophical thought of traditional\nAfrican sages. Engaging in actual field work in Kenya, Oruka\ninterviewed and conversed with several locally recognized and respected\nsages and amassed a substantial body of transcribed, critically edited,\nand now published texts that are the focus of critical studies as well\nas motivations for more refined work of the same kind in numerous\nplaces on the African continent. Other philosophers, a number of them\nfrom other countries and not of African descent, have taken up\nOruka\u2019s lead and continue to explore the articulate thought of\nindigenous sages while incorporating the sages\u2019 articulations\ninto their research, scholarship, and course-offerings. \u201cSage\nphilosophy\u201d has thus become a subfield of energetic work in\nAfricana philosophy in continental Africa (Oruka 1990b).\n\n\nThe Tempels-inspired debates over whether African or\nAfrican-descended peoples have philosophies or can philosophize have\nbeen resolved\u2014or are no longer taken seriously\u2014and given\nway to explorations of other concerns. Both the anti-colonial struggles\nand the challenges of sustaining post-colonial successes and resolving\nsetbacks and failures have prompted much academic philosophizing. The\nevidence is the development of programs of study leading to advanced\nand terminal degrees in Philosophy with strong emphasis, in a number of\ninstances, on African philosophy in a significant number of\ninstitutions of higher education in several countries (Kenya, Nigeria,\nPeoples Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Republic of Benin, Senegal,\nSouth Africa); the appearance of a variety of journals and other\npublished (and unpublished) philosophical writings and other modes of\narticulate expression (literary works, especially); the development of\nnational organizations (in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, and elsewhere)\nand international organizations (the Inter-African Council of\nPhilosophy and the Afro-Asian Philosophy Association, the latter with\nheadquarters in Cairo, Egypt, with members from throughout North\nAfrica, Sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey, Europe, and elsewhere) of\nprofessional philosophers and other knowledge-workers; and the\norganization of national, regional, and international conferences\ndevoted to explorations of topics and issues explicitly characterized\nas philosophical.\n\n\nThe continuing maturation of these developments is evident in the\nemergence of different philosophical orientations, agendas, and foci\nthat have, in turn, prompted several thinkers to endeavor to develop\ncritical, metaphilosophical overviews of developing schools or trends\nthat account for their emergence and implications, their similarities\nand differences. H. Odera Oruka (1990a) provided one such overview and\ndistinguished what he termed four \u201ccurrents\u201d in African\nphilosophy. One of these, already mentioned, he joined others in\nlabeling and characterizing as ethno-philosophy: that is,\nsecond-order works that purport to identify and engage in an exegesis\nof the philosophical schemes and significances of articulated thoughts\nand expressions, acts, and modes of behavior shared by and thus\ncharacteristic of particular African ethnic groups. Another current,\npreviously mentioned as having been initiated by Oruka, he termed\nphilosophic sagacity to distinguish what he regarded as the\nrigorous and critically reflective thought of independent-minded\nindigenous thinkers who were not formally educated in modern schools.\nNationalist-ideological philosophy for Oruka was constituted\nby the articulations of persons actively engaged in political life,\nespecially those who led or otherwise contributed substantially to\nstruggles for African independence and sought to articulate conceptions\nby which to create new, liberatory social and political orders. His\ndesignation for a fourth current, professional\nphilosophy, was reserved for work by academically trained\nprofessional teachers and scholars of academic Philosophy and their\nstudents.\n\n\nOther nuanced characterizations and examinations of trends in\nphilosophizing on the African continent have been developed. O. Nkombe\nand Alphonse J. Smet (1978) identified an ideological trend, quite\nsimilar in characterization to Oruka\u2019s\n\u201cnationalist-ideological current,\u201d that includes several\nvery rich lines of articulate socio-political thought devoted to\nreconstructing the political and cultural situations of African peoples\nthat were consequences of European imperialism, enslavement, and\ncolonization: African personality; Pan-Africanism; N\u00e9gritude;\nAfrican humanism; African socialism; scientific socialism;\nConsciencism; and African \u201cauthenticity.\u201d A second trend,\nthe traditionalist, includes efforts that are quite similar to\nOruka\u2019s sage philosophy in that the efforts are focused on\nidentifying philosophizing practices by traditional Africa thinkers,\nexploring the philosophical aspects of manifestations of these\npractices, and examining just how these practices resulted in the\ndevelopment of repositories of wisdom and esoteric knowledge. Nkombe\nand Smet identified a third trend: the intellectual orientations and\npractices of critical thinkers characterized by these\nthinkers\u2019 critiques of the projects of persons grouped in the\nideological and traditionalist trends structuring\ntheir critiques by norms and strategies drawn from familiar\nLeft-critical (Marxist), Liberal Democratic, and creative\nappropriations of other traditions of European thought. Thinkers in the\ncritical group applied the label\n\u201cethno-philosophy\u201d to a number of the instances of thought\nin the traditionalist trend to set apart the latter modes of\nthought, as previously noted, as more akin to ethnology than proper\nphilosophizing. Finally, Nkombe and Smet labeled a fourth grouping the\nsynthetic trend, one characterized by the use of philosophical\nhermeneutics to explore issues and to examine new problems emerging in\nAfrican contexts.\n\n\nStill other scholars have attributed somewhat different\ncharacterizations to these and other traditions or modes of\nphilosophizing in Africa and, importantly, identified newer\ndevelopments. An example of the latter is the pathsetting\nmetaphilosophical and anthologizing work of Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, the\ndeceased philosopher from Nigeria who pioneered bringing into several\nidea-spaces and discursive communities of academic Philosophy in the\nUnited States and Africa the interdisciplinary writings of contemporary\nscholars and artists from across Africa, African Diasporas, and other\ncountries all of whom are significant contributors to\npostcolonial philosophizings. These are critical explorations\nof the challenges and opportunities facing Africans and people of\nAfrican descent in various national and transnational situations\ndefined by configurations of conditions after colonialism in\nwhich political liberation has not ended the suffering of African\npeoples, resolved long-running problems of individual and social\nidentity, or settled questions regarding the most appropriate relations\nof individuals to communities; of appropriate roles and\nresponsibilities of women and men and their relations to one another;\nof justice and equity after centuries of injustice and dehumanization;\nor of the most appropriate terms on which to order social and political\nlife (Eze 1997).\n\n\nThe heuristic value of the concept of postcolonial is not to\nbe underappreciated, for the various instances in which the successes\nof defeating the classical, directly administered colonial ventures in\nAfrica of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been compromised\nby situations of indirect rule, or neocolonialism, effected through\neconomic control of the new African nation-states by Western European\nand U.S. American transnational capitalist enterprises and\nmultinational organizations and agencies supposedly providing advice\nand aid. These compromises must be fully appreciated in order to\nunderstand the prospects for full national independence and\nself-determination in the areas of economic, political, social, and\ncultural life generally. Of decisive issue is on what terms, via which\nstrategies, African countries will contend with emergent challenges,\nsome of which are of magnitudes and character neither encountered nor\nimaginable by \u201ctraditional\u201d African thinkers, or, even, by\ncontemporary thinkers. Foremost are the challenges from the scourge of\nHIV AIDS, which is proving to have as much impact demographically,\nthus in other areas of life, as were depletions of populations during\nthe centuries of export enslavement though with consequential\ndifferential impacts on age groups. Likewise challenging are questions\nof the priority and efficacy of armed struggle and the terms of\nengagement in light of recent and ongoing histories of such ventures\non the African continent, too many of which involve conscripting\nchildren into armies as armed warriors. Still other challenges: the\nterms and practices of political governance, at the level of the state\nespecially, as many African nations struggle against collapse or\ndebilitating dysfunction due to corruption, crippling economic\nexploitation, massive underdevelopment of human capital\u2014of\nfemales especially\u2014scarcities of food and other vital resources,\nand due to campaigns of genocide as ethnic affirmations coupled with\nethnic denunciations \u2018go imperial\u2019.\n\n\nScholarly efforts to develop informative and critical\nmetaphilosophical overviews of African philosophical trends, currents,\nand schools of thought, in part to forge new conceptions through which\nto take up these and other pressing challenges, are confirmation of\nthe rich diversity of formal philosophizing by academic philosophers\nand other intellectuals and artists that emerged on the African\ncontinent during recent decades, and of the continuing maturation of\ntheir efforts. A significant number of these intellectual workers,\nphilosophers among them, have cultivated international relationships\nwith other scholars and artists and their organizations; and some of\nthem have spent several years in, or even relocated to, the United\nStates, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, and other countries\nfor both formal education and to work in institutions of higher\neducation.  In the process of doing so many have also developed the\nprofessional relations, practices, and levels of accomplishment and\nrecognition that have led to the publication of works that are\ncontinuing to attract wider critical attention in various discursive\ncommunities and are being added to course and seminar readings. These\nmovements, relocations, cultivations of transnational relationships,\nand expansion of the literature of published works have enriched the\ndevelopment of new idea-spaces, the circulation of ideas, the\nformation of new discursive communities, and thereby contributed\nsubstantially to the development of Africana philosophy. There are now\nhistories of African philosophy and major collections of writings in\nthe subfield by professional African, African-descended, and other\nphilosophers published by major, transnational publishing firms\ncovering a still-expanding list of subject-matters organized, in many\ninstances, by themes long established in academic Philosophy:\nhistorical studies; issues of methodology, logic, epistemology,\nmetaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics; philosophy of religion; political\nand social philosophy (Hallen 2009; Kwame 1995; Mosley 1995; Wiredu\n2004). In several noteworthy instances, these philosophizings are\nconducted by way of deliberate explorations of articulations of the\nsettled thought structuring the life-worlds of particular ethnic\ngroups. Such explorations are being conducted in increasing numbers\nand, in the process, are rehabilitating and giving new meaning and\nheuristic direction to the once disparaged notion of\n\u201cethno-philosophy\u201d by establishing the legitimacy and\nresourcefulness of culturally and ethnologically contextualized\nstudies of articulated thought. As well, such studies will prove\nimportant for comparative studies of philosophizing (Bell\n2002). Hopefully, these efforts will motivate similar studies in other\nparts of the world, contribute to comparative studies that will\nenhance our understandings of philosophizing globally, and curtail\npractices of making false generalizations in some modes of\nphilosophical discourse, as, for example, characterizing the\nthought-endeavors of canonical Greek and European thinkers as being\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in their defining features or salience while\nbeing silent about the racial/ethnic, cultural, and gendered\ncharacteristics of the endeavors on the pretext that such matters are\nof no consequence for the thinkers\u2019\n\u201cphilosophy.\u201d\n",
