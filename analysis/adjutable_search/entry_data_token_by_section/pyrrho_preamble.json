    "main_text": "\n\nPyrrho was the starting-point for a philosophical movement known as\nPyrrhonism that flourished beginning several centuries after his own\ntime. This later Pyrrhonism was one of the two major traditions of\nsceptical thought in the Greco-Roman world (the other being located in\nPlato\u2019s Academy during much of the Hellenistic period). Perhaps\nthe central question about Pyrrho is whether or to what extent he\nhimself was a sceptic in the later Pyrrhonist mold. The later\nPyrrhonists claimed inspiration from him; and, as we shall see, there\nis undeniably some basis for this. But it does not follow that\nPyrrho\u2019s philosophy was identical to that of this later\nmovement, or even that the later Pyrrhonists thought that it was\nidentical; the claims of indebtedness that are expressed by or\nattributed to members of the later Pyrrhonist tradition are broad and\ngeneral in character (and in Sextus Empiricus\u2019 case notably\ncautious\u2014see Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.7), and do not in\nthemselves point to any particular reconstruction of Pyrrho\u2019s\nthought. It is necessary, therefore, to focus on the meager evidence\nbearing explicitly upon Pyrrho\u2019s own ideas and attitudes. How we\nread this evidence will also, of course, affect our conception of\nPyrrho\u2019s relations with his own philosophical contemporaries and\npredecessors.\n",
