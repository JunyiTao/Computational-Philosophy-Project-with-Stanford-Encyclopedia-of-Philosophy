    "main_text": "The Sceptical Argument || The Extensionality Condition\n2.1 The Extensionality Condition\n\nHere is how Kripke first lays out the two conditions:\n\n\nAn answer to the skeptic must satisfy two conditions. First, it must\ngive an account of what fact it is (about my mental state) that\nconstitutes my meaning plus, not quus. But further, there is a\ncondition that any putative candidate for such a fact must satisfy. It\nmust, in some sense, show how I am justified in giving the answer\n\u2018125\u2019 to \u2018\\(68+57\\)\u2019.\nThe\n\u2018directions\u2019 \u2026 that determine what I should do in\neach instance, must somehow be \u2018contained\u2019 in any\ncandidate for the fact as to what I meant. Otherwise, the skeptic has\nnot been answered when he holds that my present response is arbitrary.\n(1982: 11)\n\n\nTo begin with, Kripke claims that whatever fact makes it the case that\na speaker means addition by \u2018+\u2019 must single out the\naddition function, as opposed to the quaddition function, as what is\nmeant. It follows from this that the putative meaning-constituting\nfact must account for the conditions of correct application of\n\u2018+\u2019. In other words, the fact in which my meaning addition\nby \u2018+\u2019 consists must single out \u20184\u2019 as the\ncorrect response to \u2018\\(2 + 2\\)\u2019,\n\u2018110\u2019 as the correct response to \u2018\\(55\n+ 55\\)\u2019, \u2018125\u2019 as\nthe correct response to the query \u2018\\(68 +\n57\\)\u2019, and so on. Meaning facts render the applications\nof expressions correct or incorrect, and so a fact cannot count as a\nmeaning-constituting fact unless it does this. This is an\nuncontroversial claim, which most philosophers accept. As Simon\nBlackburn notes, this \n\n\ndistinguishes the production of terms from mere noise, and turns\nutterance into assertion\u2014into the making of judgement, \n\n\nand so \n\n\nit is not seriously open to a philosopher to deny that, in this\nminimal sense, there is such a thing as correctness and incorrectness.\n(1984 [2002: 29]; see also Wikforss 2001: 206; Hattiangadi 2006, 222;\nGl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 35; see Travis 2006 for a dissenting\nview) \n\n\nMoreover, this is something on which those who seek to offer a\nreductive account of meaning (e.g., Fodor 1990; Millikan 1984) and\nthose who are sceptical about the prospects of reduction (e.g.,\nBoghossian 1989; Verheggen 2011; Bridges 2014) seem to agree.\n\nWe\u2019ll call this first condition the extensionality\ncondition. In the case of a predicate like \u2018green\u2019,\nfor example, it requires that the fact which constitutes its meaning\ndetermines the appropriate class of things to which\n\u2018green\u2019 is correctly applicable. This will be the class of\ngreen things as opposed, say, to the class of grue things\n(where an object is grue if and only if it is green before some\nspecified time t and blue thereafter), and in the arithmetical\ncase on which we have focussed so far, the extension of\n\u2018+\u2019 will contain the triple \\(\\langle 57, 68, 125\\rangle\\)\n(and not the triple \\(\\langle 57, 68, 5\\rangle\\)).\n\nTo see how a candidate meaning-constituting fact might fail the\nextensionality condition, consider a simple form of dispositional\ntheory of meaning which proposes as constitutive of my meaning\naddition the fact that I\u2019m disposed to answer with the\nsum (as opposed, say, to the quum) when faced with\narithmetical queries of the form \u2018\\(x +\ny\\)\u2019. The sceptic argues that this fact doesn\u2019t\nsingle out the addition function:\n\n\nLet \u2018quaddition\u2019 be redefined so as to be a function which\nagrees with addition for all pairs of numbers small enough for me to\nhave any disposition to add them, and let it diverge from addition\nthereafter (say, it is 5). Then, just as the skeptic previously\nproposed the hypothesis that I meant quaddition in the old sense, now\nhe proposes quaddition in the new sense. A dispositional account will\nbe impotent to refute him. As before, there are infinitely many\ncandidates the skeptic can propose for the role of quaddition. (Kripke\n1982: 27)\n\n\nWe\u2019ll consider whether dispositionalism can muster resources to\ndeal plausibly with this problem concerning the satisfaction of the\nextensionality condition below (in\n section 4).\n",
