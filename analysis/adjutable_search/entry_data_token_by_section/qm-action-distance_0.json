    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe quantum realm involves curious correlations between distant\nevents. A well-known example is David Bohm's (1951) version of\nthe famous thought experiment that Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen\nproposed in 1935 (henceforth, the EPR/B experiment). Pairs of particles\nare emitted from a source in the so-called spin singlet state and rush\nin opposite directions (see Fig. 1 below). When the particles are\nwidely separated from each other, they each encounter a measuring\napparatus that can be set to measure their spin components along\nvarious directions. Although the measurement events are distant from\neach other, so that no slower-than-light or light signal can travel\nbetween them, the measurement outcomes are curiously\n correlated.[1]\n That is, while the outcome of each of the distant spin measurements\nseems to be a matter of pure chance, they are correlated with each\nother: The joint probability of the distant outcomes is different from\nthe product of their single probabilities. For example, the\nprobability that each of the particles will spin clockwise about the\nz-axis in a z-spin measurement (i.e., a measurement\nof the spin component along the z direction) appears to be\n\u00bd. Yet, the outcomes of such measurements are perfectly\nanti-correlated: If the left-hand-side (L-) particle happens to spin\nclockwise (anti-clockwise) about the z-axis, the\nright-hand-side (R-) particle will spin anti-clockwise (clockwise)\nabout that axis. And this is true even if the measurements are made\nsimultaneously.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A schematic illustration of the EPR/B\nexperiment. Particle pairs in the spin singlet state are emitted in\nopposite directions and when they are distant from each other\n(i.e., space-like separated), they encounter measurement apparatuses\nthat can be set to measure spin components along various\ndirections.\n\n\n\nThe curious EPR/B correlations strongly suggest the existence of\nnon-local influences between the two measurement events, and indeed\northodox \u2018collapse\u2019 quantum mechanics supports this\nsuggestion. According to this theory, before the measurements the\nparticles do not have any definite spin. The particles come to possess\na definite spin only with the first spin measurement, and the outcome\nof this measurement is a matter of chance. If, for example, the first\nmeasurement is a z-spin measurement on the L-particle, the\nL-particle will spin either clockwise or anti-clockwise about the\nz-axis with equal chance. And the outcome of the\nL-measurement causes an instantaneous change in the spin properties of\nthe distant R-particle. If the L-particle spins clockwise\n(anti-clockwise) about the z-axis, the R-particle will\ninstantly spin anti-clockwise (clockwise) about the same axis. (It is\ncommon to call spins in opposite directions \u2018spin up\u2019 and\n\u2018spin down,\u2019 where by convention a clockwise spinning may\nbe called \u2018spin up\u2019 and anti-clockwise spinning may be\ncalled \u2018spin down.\u2019)\n\n\nIt may be argued that orthodox quantum mechanics is false, and that\nthe non-locality postulated by it does not reflect any non-locality in\nthe quantum realm. Alternatively, it may be argued that orthodox\nquantum mechanics is a good instrument for predictions rather than a\nfundamental theory of the physical nature of the universe. On this\ninstrumental interpretation, the predictions of quantum mechanics are\nnot an adequate basis for any conclusion about non-locality: This\ntheory is just an incredible oracle (or a crystal ball), which provides\na very successful algorithm for predicting measurement outcomes and\ntheir probabilities, but it offers little information about ontological\nmatters, such as the nature of objects, properties and causation in the\nquantum realm.\n\n\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen (1935) thought that quantum mechanics is\nincomplete and that the curious correlations between distant systems\ndo not amount to action at a distance between them. The apparent\ninstantaneous change in the R-particle's properties during the\nL-measurement is not really a change of properties, but rather a\nchange of knowledge. (For more about the EPR argument, see the entry\non the EPR argument, Redhead 1987, chapter 3, and Albert 1992, chapter\n3. For discussions of the EPR argument in the relativistic context,\nsee Ghirardi and Grassi 1994 and Redhead and La Riviere 1997.) On this\nview, quantum states of systems do not always reflect their complete\nstate. Quantum states of systems generally provide information about\nsome of the properties that systems possess and information\nabout the probabilities of outcomes of measurements on them, and this\ninformation does not generally reflect the complete state of the\nsystems. In particular, the information encoded in the spin singlet\nstate is about the probabilities of measurement outcomes of spin\nproperties in various directions, about the conditional probabilities\nthat the L- (R-) particle has a certain spin property given that the\nR- (L-) particle has another spin property, and about the\nanti-correlation between the spins that the particles may have in any\ngiven direction (for more details, see section 5.1). Thus, the outcome\nof a z-spin measurement on the L-particle and the spin\nsinglet state (interpreted as a state of knowledge) jointly provide\ninformation about the z-spin property of the R-particle. For\nexample, if the outcome of the L-measurement is z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 we know that the R-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019; and if we assume, as EPR did, that there is no\ncurious action at a distance between the distant wings (and that the\nchange of the quantum-mechanical state of the particle pair in the\nL-measurement is only a change in state of knowledge), we could also\nconclude that the R-particle had z-spin \u2018down\u2019\neven before the L-measurement occurs.\n\n\nHow could the L-outcome change our\nknowledge/ignorance about the R-outcome if it has no influence on it?\nThe simplest and most straightforward reply is that the L- and the R-\noutcome have a common cause that causes them to be correlated, so that\nknowledge of one outcome provides knowledge about the\n other.[2]\n Yet, the question is whether the predictions of orthodox quantum\nmechanics, which have been highly confirmed by various experiments,\nare compatible with the quantum realm being local in the sense of\ninvolving no influences between systems between which light and\nslower-than-light signals cannot travel (i.e., space-like separated\nsystems). More particularly, the question is whether it is possible to\nconstruct a local, common-cause model of the EPR/B experiment, i.e., a\nmodel that postulates no influence between systems/events in the\ndistant wings of the experiment, and that the correlation between them\nare due to the state of the particle pair at the source. In 1935,\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen believed that this is possible. But, as\nJohn Bell demonstrated in 1964, this belief is difficult to\nuphold.\n",
