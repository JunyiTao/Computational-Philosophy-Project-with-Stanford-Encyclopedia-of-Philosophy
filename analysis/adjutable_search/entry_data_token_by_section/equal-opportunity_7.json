    "main_text": "Radical/Luck Egalitarian Equality of Opportunity\n8. Radical/Luck Egalitarian Equality of Opportunity\n\nTo this point, the entry has largely focused on the \u201csocietal\nfactors\u201d which determine differential prospects for\nsuccess\u2014whether in the form of legal constraints on\nopportunities, discrimination in hiring, family background etc. The\nrange of conceptions of Equality of Opportunity canvassed to this\npoint tend mostly to take for granted that there are at least some\nnatural or non-societal factors that differentially affect\npersons\u2019 prospects for success without undermining Equality of\nOpportunity. Under FEO and associated conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity, for instance, it is acceptable for more talented people\nto enjoy greater chances of success in social competition than those\nwho are less talented, provided those chances were not themselves\ninfluenced in the wrong ways by social factors, such as class, family,\nand perhaps other associational sources of inequality.\n\nThis position is challenged by a still thicker conception of Equality\nof Opportunity, which might be termed Radical Equality of Opportunity\n(Segall 2013; Swift 2014) and is often called Luck Egalitarianism (LE)\n(also labelled \u201cSocialist Equality of Opportunity\u201d by\nCohen 2009). Roughly, under the LE conception of Equality of\nOpportunity no factors other than persons\u2019 own responsible\nchoices should affect differential prospects for success (for some\nprominent early defences see Cohen 1989; Temkin 1993). LE thereby goes\nbeyond FEO and not only condemns the influence of societal\ninequalities but also differences in natural talent and ability.\nSuppose, in a simplified case, that the highest paying jobs in a given\nsociety select according to intellectual aptitude and that, even when\nsociety is organized to a point where class, gender-based, racialized,\nfamilial etc. inequalities do not affect persons\u2019 different\nprospects for success, natural differences in persons\u2019\nintelligence determine who does or does not get the highest paying\njobs. Unequal prospects based upon those natural differences are\ninconsistent with true Equality of Opportunity under the LE view,\nbecause those with lower intelligence still have relevantly unequal\nopportunities to succeed as compared with others.\n\nFor some, the intuitive appeal of the LE view is that differential\nprospects for success should be relevantly under the control of each\nindividual. Echoing concerns first voiced by Rawls (1999: 87, 274,\n447) in his A Theory of Justice, what drives the Luck\nEgalitarian view is an objection to the distributive influence of\nfactors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view and, by\nthat token, unfair determinants of inequality. As such, only\ndifferences that are the result of individuals\u2019 own responsible\nchoices (and, it is claimed, therefore non-arbitrary) create\nfair inequalities in success. The range of factors that are\nunacceptable determinants of differential success under the LE is\ntherefore broader than under thinner conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity and excludes everything other than the results of\none\u2019s own choices. The details of the LE version of\nEquality of Opportunity will be further unpacked in what follows, but\nit is worth noting that the LE view tends to differ from FEO and other\nthinner conceptions of Equality of Opportunity in other respects as\nwell. Many of the conceptions of Equality of Opportunity surveyed\nabove have a relatively limited scope inasmuch as they are concerned\nwith opportunities for certain goods, often in the context of\ncompetition\u2014usually socially advantageous positions of certain\nkinds, like jobs, offices, places in education. LE tends to be\nunderstood more broadly\u2014as a view about overall fairness of\npersons\u2019 life prospects (Segall 2013). It is therefore concerned\nwith persons\u2019 opportunities in general with respect to whatever\nhas value in life\u2014what has become known as the\n\u201ccurrency\u201d of egalitarian concern. Broadly, the LE view\nholds that if someone is worse off than others, in terms of the\noverall \u201ccurrency\u201d of what matters, because of factors\nother than their own choices, then this is an unfair violation of\nEquality of Opportunity. The LE view is therefore consistent with\npersons facing unequal opportunities to obtain particular jobs or\nroles, provided persons enjoy equal overall prospects for\nsuccess, measured in whatever \u201ccurrency\u201d is favoured. The\nLE view also naturally tends towards a global application in a way\nthat distinguishes it from some of the other conceptions. Thinner\nconceptions of Equality of Opportunity are frequently consistent with\ncriteria for success which exclude or disadvantage people on the basis\nof their nationality or geographical proximity. For instance,\nuniversity admissions may give priority to domestic applicants or even\nexclude foreign students from eligibility altogether. Certain jobs\nwill require candidates to travel for interview and relocate in the\nevent that they are successful, which will effectively exclude many\npeople from being able to compete for or accept the role. These\nconstraints will often pass as acceptable under conceptions of\nEquality of Opportunity surveyed in the above, but for the LE view\nthey are just another potential source of inequality which may stand\nin the way of realizing Equality of Opportunity (for more see\n section 10.2).\n\nLE lies near the thickest end of the continuum by which we can\norganize various conceptions of Equality of Opportunity. It holds that\nonly choice is an appropriate source of unequal prospects for success.\nA still thicker conception might deny that even choice should\ndetermine differences, and, instead, that no factors are\nacceptable determinants of unequal success (for a qualified version of\nsuch a view see Persson 2007). This would amount to Equality of\nOpportunity as equal outcome. Whether or not this is a justified\nposition, it might be strained to label this an Equal\nOpportunity view. Although LE occupies this place on the\ncontinuum of conceptions, where few factors are acceptable\ndeterminants of unequal prospects, it is misleading to think of LE as\ncommending equal chances for success. Equal chances of\nsuccess could be secured by simply having an equal lottery between\neveryone, the outcome of which results in some people faring very well\nand others faring very poorly. This would be straightforwardly\ninconsistent with LE, because the inequalities would not be a result\nof persons\u2019 own choices but, rather, the outcome of the lottery\n(for an example of this type see B. Barry 1988)\n\nAt the heart of LE is the distinction, first introduced by Ronald\nDworkin, between \u201coption luck\u201d and \u201cbrute\nluck\u201d. Option luck is\n\n\na matter of how deliberate and calculated gambles turn\nout\u2014whether someone gains or loses through accepting an isolated\nrisk he or she should have anticipated and might have declined.\n(Dworkin 1981: 293)\n\n\nBrute luck is defined in contradistinction to option luck as \u201ca\nmatter of how risks fall out that are not in that sense deliberate\ngambles\u201d (1981: 293). To illustrate the distinction, Dworkin\ncontinues:\n\n\nIf I buy a stock on the exchange that rise, then my option luck is\ngood. If I am hit by a falling meteorite whose course could not have\nbeen predicted, then my bad luck is brute. (1981: 293)\n\n\nRoughly, then, brute luck is a matter of things that happen to us\nwhich are relevantly independent of our choices, including both things\nthat happen to us over the course of our lives and things which we are\nborn with, whereas option luck is a matter of the reasonably\nforeseeable consequences for us of the choices we could reasonably\nhave avoided making. For LE, inequalities in brute luck are unfair and\nunjust, whereas inequalities in option luck are fair and just. Persons\ntherefore enjoy Equality of Opportunity in the relevant way when their\nbrute luck is equal with others and outcomes differ only as a result\nof differences in option luck\u2014namely the foreseeable outcomes of\ntheir own responsible choices. These essentials of the LE view have\nbeen further refined in various work, and the LE view has generated\nsubstantial debate (for some critical views see Anderson 1999;\nFleurbaey 2001; Scheffler 2003; 2005; Seligman 2007; for some\ndefences, see Arneson 2004; N. Barry 2006; Elford 2017; Knight 2005;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2016; Segall 2007; Stemplowska 2013; Voigt\n2007).\n\nBeyond matters of substantive debate between critics and defenders of\nLE, there are various complexities pertaining to the application of\nthe LE view. One is that persons\u2019 choices are generally, if not\nalways, made in the context of pre-existing unfair inequality. Suppose\nwe have two young people\u2014Sydney and Miriam\u2014who face a\nchoice between going to university to acquire new skills or working a\nlow paying job. The outcome of that choice will affect their prospects\nfor success in applications for high paying jobs in the future, and\nthe earnings from those jobs will far exceed what they are able to\nearn in a low paying job, even when they take up that low paid work\nimmediately. Sydney enjoys the good brute luck of having been born\ninto a rich family, which can help pay for her university fees and are\nnot themselves suffering from any financial hardship. Miriam, on the\nother hand, is from a poor family, which does not have the means to\nhelp her financially through university and struggles to pay domestic\nbills. Suppose Sydney opts to go to university, Miriam chooses to take\na low paying job, and as a result Sydney enjoys far better prospects\nin the competition for higher paying jobs. Although the differences in\nadvantage between Sydney and Miriam were partly the result of their\nrespective choices (and, to that extent, constitute option luck),\nthose choices were made in the context of considerably different\ncircumstances, which themselves represent unfair brute luck\ndifferences between the two (see Swift 2008: 364 for a note on how\ncritics of LE have sometimes overlooked this important qualifier).\nThis brief illustration indicates that the question of how far persons\nshould be held liable for option luck disadvantage (or entitled to\noption luck advantage) under conditions of unequal brute luck is a\nprofoundly difficult one. To add to the complexity, choices may not\nonly be influenced in the sense that they are taken in the context of\na certain range of options, which may differ, unfairly, for different\npersons, but persons\u2019 choices are themselves informed by\ndifferent dispositions, inclinations, and knowledge bases which\nthemselves depend partly on brute factors (Voorhoeve 2008). How much\neffort a person is inclined to make, which options they view as being\nviable or valuable, and how focused different persons become on tasks\nare all things which differ across persons and may be affected, to one\ndegree or another, by brute luck factors such as a person\u2019s\nsocial circumstances or their genetic predisposition to think in\ncertain ways. Again, the question of how to disentangle brute from\noption luck considerations looks immensely challenging.\n\nStill further, circumstances constrain which options are\nreasonable for people to pursue and to that extent might\naffect which choices qualify as \u201cdeliberate gambles\u201d in\nDworkin\u2019s sense. Suppose, in the example above, that Miriam has\na gravely ill mother who urgently needs expensive medication that she\ncan only get if Miriam immediately begins earning money in whichever\njob is available. It is plausible to think that going to university,\nrather than earning immediate money, is simply an unreasonable option\nfor Miriam, given what it would mean for her mother\u2019s health.\nFor this reason, one might argue that Miriam\u2019s resulting\ndisadvantage in the future employment stakes is more brute luck than\noption luck, even though it issued from a choice she made (for\nanalysis of a similar case, see de Shalit and Wolff 2011).\n\nThe most well-developed theory attempting to grapple with some of the\nchallenges of this sort is offered by John Roemer (1998; 2002; 2003).\nRoemer starts from the perspective that there are aspects of a\nperson\u2019s environment which are relevantly beyond that\nperson\u2019s control\u2014their\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d\u2014which can be distinguished from a\nperson\u2019s acts of autonomous volition\u2014their\n\u201ceffort\u201d. Roemer offers a proposal designed to help\npolicymakers determine the extent to which persons\u2019 outcomes are\na result of their circumstances or their efforts. That proposal\ninvolves sorting people into \u201ctypes\u201d based on how\nadvantageous their circumstances are. Distributive differences within\neach types reflect the differential \u201ceffort\u201d individuals\nmake. Equality of Opportunity requires equalizing between\ntypes (given that the difference between types is based on\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d\u2014factors outside of\nindividuals\u2019 control in the relevant sense) but not equalizing\nto eliminate differences in individuals\u2019 place within\ntypes (given that such differences are based on \u201ceffort\u201d).\nTo crudely illustrate, suppose we have an \u201cadvantaged\u201d\ntype (e.g., from a rich background) and a \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d\ntype (e.g., from a poor background), and within each type we have\n\u201clow effort\u201d and \u201chigh effort\u201d groups.\nRoemer\u2019s proposal involves equalizing between \u201chigh\neffort\u201d \u201cadvantaged\u201d and \u201chigh effort\u201d\n\u201cdisadvantaged\u201d individuals and also equalizing between\n\u201clow effort\u201d \u201cadvantaged\u201d and \u201clow\neffort\u201d \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d individuals but does not\nrequire further equalization between \u201chigh effort\u201d and\n\u201clow effort\u201d (for critiques see Hurley 2003: ch. 7;\nPhillips 2006: 20\u201323; Risse 2002).\n\nAlthough the LE conception of Equality of Opportunity has classically\ninvolved a view of option luck which appears to take for granted\nDworkin\u2019s original way of specifying the idea, this aspect of LE\nhas been scrutinized and developed in other work (Arneson 2004; Dekker\n2009; Elford 2018; Olsaretti 2009; Stemplowska 2009; Temkin 2011).\nSuppose Taylor chooses to stay at home and take care of her two\nchildren and that this leaves her worse off than she would have been\nby going out to work a full-time job. Assuming her choice was\nrelevantly unconstrained by those circumstances, her being worse off\nlooks like a matter of option luck. She made a choice and should be\nheld liable for its foreseeable consequences. LE views have often\nimplicitly supposed that it is the actual foreseeable consequences of\nchoice, or the consequences determined by the uncoerced responses from\nothers (for instance through the free market) which ought to determine\nthe consequences. But this might be questioned, as the basic\ndistinction between choices and circumstances at the root of LE is, in\nfact, consistent with a range of different views regarding the\nconsequences that persons should be held liable for/entitled to as a\nresult of their choices (Arneson 2004; Olsaretti 2009; Stemplowska\n2009). Perhaps care-giving choices should be rewarded more highly than\nthe market rewards them, and perhaps more highly than the other\nvocations. One could argue for this conclusion on various grounds\n(Olsaretti 2009: 182\u2013186). Perhaps it would be valuable to\nincentivize care-giving choices in a way that the market presently\nfails to do, or, for a different reason, because there is something\nbasically valuable about care-giving that means such choices are\ndeserving of reward (Temkin 2011). The point is that the Equality of\nOpportunity aspect of LE\u2014that persons should only fare better or\nworse than others as a result of their own choices\u2014is\nconsistent with a range of accounts concerning which benefits or\nliabilities ought to pertain to different choices.\n\nThe LE position has engendered a substantial amount of debate since\nits inception. Some lines of criticism point to its putatively\nimplausible implications for policymaking (Wolff 1998).However, the LE\nconception of Equality of Opportunity is an abstract, ideal conception\nwhich few, if any, of its advocates believe can be perfectly\ninstantiated (Arneson 2004: 13\u201314). Almost all those who hold an\nLE conception also tend to view it as one consideration of justice, to\nbe considered against other values. LE is a view concerning which\ninequalities are fair, even if unfair inequalities can be justified on\nother grounds. For instance, just as with FEO, LE fairness is in\ntension with the family inasmuch as the existence of the family\ngenerates brute luck inequalities between different children. It is\nconsistent with LE to hold that the family is an all-things-considered\njustified and valuable social mode of organization, whilst contending\nthat it standardly generates lamentable, unfair inequalities which we\nhave reason to mitigate.\n\nThere are different approaches to the inequalities that are\njustified under the LE view. LE is sometimes understood as a view\nwhich merely permits those inequalities, such that the\nelimination of those inequalities would not be bad. This LE conception\nof Equality of Opportunity would be consistent with redistributive\nmeasures to create equal outcomes, even if it would not\nmandate the elimination of option luck inequality (Segall\n2013). Alternatively, LE is sometimes understood as a view that\nrequires option luck inequalities, under which redistribution\nto eliminate option luck inequalities would be positively unfair\n(Cohen 2006: 444), even if that might be justified by other values.\nUnderstood in this way, LE shares with the meritocratic conception the\nnotion that some differences in prospects are required (the\nmore qualified should be advantaged in the competition),\nrather than merely permitted.\n",
