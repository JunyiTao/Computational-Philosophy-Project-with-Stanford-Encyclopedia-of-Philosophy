    "main_text": "Terminology and Definitions || Gene\u2014Genome\u2014Genomics\n1.1 Gene\u2014Genome\u2014Genomics\n\nThe term \u2018genomics\u2019 derives from the term\n\u2018genome\u2019, which itself derives (in part) from the term\n\u2018gene\u2019. The meaning(s) of\u2014and the relationships\nbetween\u2014these different terms is by no means simple.\n\nThe term \u2018gene\u2019 was introduced in 1909 by the Danish\nbiologist Wilhelm Johannsen, who used it to refer to the (then\nuncharacterised) elements that specify the inherited characteristics\nof an organism (see\n gene\n and\n molecular genetics\n entries for an overview of the complex history of the term\n\u2018gene\u2019).\n\nThe term \u2018genome\u2019 was introduced in 1920 by the German\nbotanist Hans Winkler (1877\u20131945) in his publication\n\u201cVerbreitung und Ursache der Parthenogenesis im Pflanzen- und\nTierreiche\u201d (Prevalence and Cause of Parthenogenesis in the\nPlant and Animal Kingdom). Winkler defined the term as follows:\n\n\nIch schlage vor, f\u00fcr den haploiden Chromosomensatz, der im Verein\nmit dem zugeh\u00f6rigen Protoplasma die materielle Grundlage der\nsystematischen Einheit darstellt, den Ausdruck: das Genom zu verwenden\n[\u2026]. (Winkler 1920: 165)\n\nI propose to use the expression \u2018genome\u2019 for the haploid\nset of chromosomes that, in conjunction with the associated\nprotoplasm, represents the material foundation of the systematic unit\n[often translated as \u2018species\u2019]. (Translation by S.G.)\n\n\nThe etymology of the term is not clear but most authors and\nencyclopaedia entries assume that it is a combination of the German\nwords \u2018Gen\u2019 and \u2018Chromosom\u2019,\nleading to the composite \u2018Genom\u2019. In general, the\norigin and the different meanings of the -ome suffix are not entirely\nclear and there are now several accounts that try to bring some\nstructure and/or meaning to the ever flourishing -omes terminology in\ncontemporary life sciences (see, e.g., Lederberg & McCray 2001;\nFields & Johnston 2002; Yadav 2007; Eisen 2012: Baker 2013; for interesting/entertaining\nlists, see -omes and -omics in the \n Other Internet Resources section  below).\n\nThe term \u2018genomics\u2019, finally, was invented in 1986 at a\nmeeting of several scientists who were brainstorming (in a bar) to\ncome up with a name for a new journal that Frank Ruddle (Yale\nUniversity) and Victor McKusick (Johns Hopkins University) were\nsetting up. The aim of this journal was to publish data on the\nsequencing, mapping and comparison of genomes. To capture these\ndifferent activities\u2014and in analogy to the well-established\ndiscipline of genetics\u2014Thomas Roderick (Jackson Laboratory)\nproposed the term \u2018genomics\u2019 (Kuska 1998). Unbeknownst to\nthe people involved this was a significant moment in the history of\nthe life sciences, as it is here that the -omics suffix appears for the\nfirst time.\n",
