    "main_text": "Feminist Approaches to Bioethical Analysis || Listening to marginalized voices\n3.4 Listening to marginalized voices\n\nFeminist bioethics is distinctive in the emphasis it places on\nrecognizing the historical and continuing exclusion of minority\nviewpoints as a form of epistemic injustice in which the knowledge of\nmarginalized groups is kept out of mainstream bioethics. From early\non, feminist bioethics looked beyond the marginalization of sex and\ngender to other forms of exclusion, and sought to identify how power\nrelations interacting with minority statuses can perpetuate moral\nharms in research, clinical care, and public health. The dismissal of\nthe experiences and perspectives of women, Black, or disabled people\nis now increasingly acknowledged in bioethics. However, feminist\nanalyses also illuminate relevant examples of damaging exclusions that\nfall outside the boundaries of familiar minority categories or\nprotected characteristics. These include the suppression of\n\u201canomalous\u201d knowledge that is assumed to be distorted by\nmental illness (Bluhm 2011; Thachuk 2011) and the silence within\nmainstream bioethics about the role of low-paid care workers in\nhealthcare. They have also drawn connections between epistemic\ninjustice and feminist work on microaggressions experienced by\npatients in clinical settings (Buchman et al. 2017; Freeman &\nStewart 2019).\n",
