Mach offers a\nselectionist account of group-level change consisting of selection\nupon naturally produced variation, passed on through processes of\nheredity. As with Darwinian evolution, scientific variation itself is\nnot directed. Emphasizing the importance of natural variation, Mach\nhad a Feyerabendian tolerance of nonscientific beliefs\u2014the\nfamiliar point being that it is better to tolerate some error than risk\nlosing variation which might yield fruit later. As an indication of\nvariation\u2019s importance, several chapters in his various books are\ndirected almost entirely to this subject.  Variation is not something\nwhich we consciously produce, but rather something which happens by\naccident.\n\n\nThe mind is not able to come up with new ideas on its own, that is,\nit is unable to direct creativity. Thus, variation is not\ndirected, but science relies on fantasy, chance, luck, etc., for\nproduction of its ideas. Once produced, scientists choose those\nideas which best fit the facts. Mach also comments on the debates\nover whether reasoning, inductive or deductive, can produce knowledge,\narguing that reasoning cannot by itself produce knowledge, but rather\ncan only operate on existing variation: \u201cThus syllogism and\ninduction do not create new knowledge, but merely make sure that there\nis no contradiction between our various insights and show clearly how\nthese are connected, and lead our attention to different sides of some\nparticular insight, teaching us to recognize it in different\nforms. Obviously, then, the genuine source from which the\nenquirer gains knowledge must lie elsewhere.\u201d [KE:\n231]\n\n\nAlthough the mind cannot direct the creation of ideas, it can direct\nthe selection of them. Selection occurs when the\nscientists choose the theories, out of the pool of available variation,\nwhich best fit the data and other pre-existing ideas. It is also\nworth noting that Mach talks of the tendency for resistance to change\nas being both necessary and problematic for science. Mach was not\nonly one of the founders of Gestalt Theory, but also applied its core\nconcepts to the process of science. Packaged together with his use of\nhistory to elucidate science, he anticipates Kuhn\u2019s ideas on\nscientific change and progressive rationality.\n",
