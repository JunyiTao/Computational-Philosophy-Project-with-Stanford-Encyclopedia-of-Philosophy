Emptiness\n\nThe annihilation of the self, as the negation of negation\n\u201cconstitutes the basis of every selfless morality since ancient\ntimes,\u201d asserts Watsuji (Watsuji 1996, 225). The negating of the\ngroup or society, and the emptying of the individual in\nWatsuji\u2019s sense of the negation of each by the other pole of\nningen, makes evident that both are ultimately\n\u2018empty,\u2019 causing one to reflect upon that which is\nultimate, and at the base of both one\u2019s individuality and the\ngroups with which one associates. The losing of self is a returning to\none\u2019s authenticity, to one\u2019s home ground as that source\nfrom which all things derive, and by which they are sustained. It is\nthe abandonment of the self as independent which paves the way for the\nnondual relation between the self and others that terminates in the\nactivity of benevolence and compassion through a unification of minds.\nThe ethics of benevolence is the development of the capacity to\nembrace others as oneself or, more precisely, to forget one\u2019s\nself such that the distinction between the self and other does not\narise in this nondualistic awareness. One has now abandoned\none\u2019s self, one\u2019s individuality, and become the authentic\nground of the self and the other as the realization of absolute\ntotality. Ethics is now a matter of spontaneous compassion,\nspontaneous caring, and concern for the whole. This is the birth of\nselfless morality, for which the only counterparts in the West are the\nmystical traditions and perhaps some forms of religiosity in which it\nis God who moves in us, and not we ourselves. The double negation\nreferred to earlier whereby the individual is negated by the group\naspect of self, and the group aspect is in turn negated by the\nindividual aspect, is not to be taken as a complete negation that\nobliterates that which is negated. The negated are preserved, else\nthere would be no true self-contradiction. This robust sense of the\nimportance of self-contradiction shares much with the more developed\nsense of the identity of self-contradiction about which Nishida said\nso much (see the entry on\n Nishida Kitar\u014d).\n What is stressed by both thinkers is that some judgments of logical\ncontradiction are at best penultimate judgments, which may point us in\nthe direction of a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of\nour own experience. Watsuji refers to \u2018wakaru \u2019\n(to understand), which is derived from \u2018wakeru \u2019\n(to divide); and in order to understand, one must already have\npresupposed something whole, that is to say, a system or unity. For\nexample, in self-reflection, we make our own self, other. Yet\nthe distinction reveals the original unity, for the self is other as\nobjectified and of course is divided from the originally unified self.\nTo think of a thing is to distinguish it from something else, and yet\nin order to make such a distinction, the two must already have had\nsomething in common. Thus, to emphasize the contradiction is to plunge\ninto the world as many; to emphasize the context, or background, or\nmatrix is to plunge into the world as one. Readers will be familiar\nwith the logical formulation, often encountered in Zen but ubiquitous\nin Buddhism generally, that A is A; and A\nis not-A; therefore, A is A. There is a\ndouble negation in evidence here: an individual is an individual, and\nyet an individual is not individual unless one stands opposed to other\nindividuals. That an individual stands opposed to others means that\none is related to others as a member of a group or groups. Because an\nindividual is a member of a group, one is both a member as an\nindividual, and an otherwise isolated individual as a member of a\ngroup. We are both, in mutual interactive negation, and as such we are\ndetermined by the group or community, and yet we ourselves determine\nand shape the group or community. As such we are living\nself-contradictions, and, therefore, living identities of\nself-contradiction. \n\nMorality, for Watsuji, is a coming back to authentic unity through an\ninitial opposition between the self and other, and then a\nre-establishing of betweenness between self and other, ideally\nculminating in a nondualistic connection between the self and others\nthat actually negates any trace of difference or opposition in the\nemptiness of the home ground. This is the negation of negation, and it\noccurs in both time and space. It is not simply a matter of\nenlightenment as a private, individual experience, calling one to\nawareness of the interconnectedness of all things. Rather, it is a\nspatio-temporal series of interconnected actions, occurring in the\nbetweenness between us, which leads us to an awareness of betweenness\nthat ultimately eliminates the self and other, but of course, only\nfrom within a nondualist perspective. Dualistically comprehended, both\nthe self and other are preserved. As the Zen saying goes, \u201cnot\none, not two.\u201d As Taigen Dan Leighton explains,\n\u201cnonduality is not about transcending the duality of form and\nemptiness. This deeper nonduality is not the opposite of duality, but\nthe synthesis of duality and nonduality, with both included, and both\nseen as ultimately not separate, but as integrated\u201d(Leighton\n2004, 35). For Watsuji, emptiness is what makes the subject-object\nrelation, or better, the relation both inherent in ningen and\nbetween ningen possible. What is left is betweenness itself\nin which human actions occur. In this sense, betweenness is emptiness,\nand emptiness is betweenness. Betweenness is the place where\ncompassion arises and is acted out selflessly in the spatio-temporal\ntheatre of the world. It is that which makes possible the variety of\nrelationships of which human beings are capable. Watsuji\u2019s\nningen views each person\u2019s ethical identity as\nintegrally related to that of others and extends it beyond merely\nhuman relations. Self and other, self and nature, are viewed as\ninseparable from ethical identity and are related to, rather than\nviewed as opposed to or exclusive of each other. In Watsuji\u2019s\nningen we find this nondualism lived out in ways that extend\nethical identity beyond relations between human beings to encompass\nthe world in which we live \u2014 it is part of milieu or\nf\u016bdo. \n5. The State\n\nWatsuji\u2019s theory of the state, and his vocal support of the\nEmperor system, garnered considerable criticism after the Second World\nWar. La Fleur maintains that Watsuji\u2019s detractors were\n\u201cdominant in Japanese intellectual life from 1945 to\napproximately 1975,\u201d while his admirers became \u201cnewly\narticulate since the decade of the 1980s\u201d (LaFleur 1994, 453).\nThe former group considered his position to be a dangerous one. He\nargued that the culmination of the double negation, which he conceived\nof as a single movement, was the restoration of the absolute totality.\nIn other words, while the individual negates the group in order to be\nan authentic and independent individual, the second negation is to\nabandon one\u2019s independence as an individual in the full\nrealization of totality. It is a \u2018surrender\u2019 to totality,\nmoving one beyond the myriad specific groups to the one total and\nabsolute whole. It would seem natural that this ultimate wholeness\nwould be the home ground of nothingness, and in a way it is. But\nWatsuji argues that it is the state that takes on the authority of\ntotality. It is the highest and best social structure thus far. The\npolitical implications of this position could easily result in a\ntotalitarian state ethics. Indeed, Watsuji extolled the superiority of\ntraditional Japanese culture because of its emphasis on self-negation,\nincluding the making of the ultimate sacrifice if required by the\nEmperor. In America\u2019s National Character (1944), he\ncontrasted this willingness to an assumed selfishness or egocentrism\nfound in the West, together with a utilitarian ethic of expediency,\nwhich he felt was rarely able to commit to self-surrender in aid of\nthe state. What he saw as most exemplary in the Japanese way of life\nwas the Bushido ideal of \u201cthe absolute negativity of the\nsubject\u201d (Odin 1996, 67), through which the totality of the\nwhole is able to be achieved. There is no doubt that Watsuji\u2019s\nposition could easily be interpreted as a totalitarian state ethics.\nYet, insofar as Watsuji\u2019s analysis of Japanese ethics is an\naccount of how the Japanese do actually act in the world, then it is\nlittle surprise that the Japanese errors of excess which culminated in\nthe fascism of the Second World War period should be found somehow\nimplicit and possible in Watsuji\u2019s acute presentation of\nJapanese cultural history. Perhaps the fault to be found lies not in\nhis analysis per se, but rather in his all too sanguine collapsing of\nthe descriptive and the prescriptive. That the Japanese\nway-in-the-world might include a totalitarian seed is something which\ndemands a normative warning. Surely this is not what should be\napplauded as an aspect of the alleged superiority of Japanese culture,\nnor should Bushido in and of itself be taken as a blameless path to\nthe highest of ethical achievements. The willingness to be loyal,\nwhatever the rights and wrongs of the situation might be, in order to\nremain loyal to one\u2019s Lord, however evil or foolhardy he might\nbe, is not an adequate or rational position, and it is surely not\nlaudable ethically. It is, perhaps, the way the samurai saw\nthemselves, as martial servants loyal to death. But the\n\u2018is\u2019 here is clearly not a moral \u2018ought\u2019. \n\nWhat Watsuji adds to this picture which makes it extremely difficult\nto condemn him too harshly, and possibly to condemn him at all, is his\nadament insistence in the third volume of Rinrigaku that no\none nation has charted the correct political and cultural path, and\nthat the diversity of each is to be both encouraged and respected. He\nwrites of unity in diversity, and rejects the idea that any nation has\nthe right to culturally assimilate another. Each nation is shaped by\nits particular geography, climate, culture and history, and the\nresultant diversity is both to be protected and appreciated, and the\nnotion of a universal state is, therefore, but an unwanted and\ndangerous delusion. We must know our own traditions, and to cherish\nthose, but we must not extol them as superior out of our ignorance of\nother ways and cultural traditions. In fact, such ignorance, resulting\nfrom Japan\u2019s unwise self-imposed isolationism, Watsuji saw as\nthe most tragic flaw in Japan\u2019s own history, and a cause of the\nSecond World War. Japan knew so little of the outside world in the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, that it exaggerated its\nown worth and power, and vastly underestimated the importance of\npolitical and diplomatic involvement in the happenings of the rest of\nthe world. Nationalism must not express itself at the expense of\ninternationalism, and internationalism must not establish itself at\nthe expense of nationalism. Here is another pair of seeming\ncontradictions to be held together by the unity of mutual interaction;\nthe one modifies the other, and that tension is not to be resolved.\nInternationalism must be a unity of independent and distinctive\nnations. \n\nFive months before the end of the Second World War, Watsuji organized\na study group to re-think the Tokugawa Period (1600-1868), which\nresulted in his popular work, Closed Nation: Japan\u2019s\nTragedy (Sakoku), published in 1950. Some critics\nreacted by dubbing this work \u201cWatsuji\u2019s Tragedy\u201d\n(LaFleur 2001, 1), yet La Fleur insists that Sakoku, together\nwith a collection of other contemporaneous writings, provides a\nserious and important insight into Watsuji\u2019s later philosophical\nposition. His focal thesis was that the tragedy of the Japanese\ninvolvement in the Second World War was a direct result of\nJapan\u2019s policy of national seclusion. Isolationism took Japan\nout of the events of the world\u2019s activities for two centuries,\nallowing the West to outstrip Japan in terms of science and\ntechnology. But even more important is Watsuji\u2019s insistence that\nthe nationalists and militarists should have seen that Japan was in no\nposition to win the war since both \u201cmen and materiel were in\nincreasingly short supply\u201d (LaFleur 2001, 3). Not that Watsuji\nopposed the war, but the point he was making was that the tragedy came\nto be because the earlier isolationist attitude had been revived from\n1940 on. Japan was out of touch with the strengths and determination\nof its adversaries, and seemingly convinced that the character of the\nJapanese people would ensure success. Furthermore, coupled with this\nshort-term return to a head-in-the-sand isolationism of the 1940s, was\nWatsuji\u2019s insistence that throughout most of Japan\u2019s\nhistory, the Japanese people had demonstrated an intense curiosity and\na robust desire to learn, and in particular to learn from cultures\nquite different from their own: \u201cNo matter how far we go back in\nJapanese culture we will not find an age in which evidence of\nadmiration of foreign cultures is not to be found\u201d (Watsuji\n1998, 250). Japan was withdrawing inwards at precisely the time when\nthe West\u2019s expansionism and imperialism was gathering steam.\nLaFleur goes so far as to suggest that in a 1943 lecture to Navy\nofficials, Watsuji attempted to warn those in charge of the dangerous\ncourse they continued to pursue. LaFleur speculates that this is why\nWatsuji felt no need to recant after the War had ended. The salient\npoint of all of this is that the instances of isolationism in Japanese\nhistory are exceptions which run counter to what Watsuji saw as the\ndominant tendency of the Japanese to both welcome and encourage\noutside influence. Japan\u2019s national character throughout the\nbulk of its history displays a remarkable openness to and interest in\nother cultures, and a steadfast desire to learn from those cultures.\nHe was advocating a return to this more \u2018normal\u2019 attitude\ntowards the outside world, and not a return to Japanese nationalism or\nchauvinism. Watsuji presents us with a complex perspective. \n6. Religion\n\nWatsuji\u2019s interest in religion was as a social phenomenon, that\nis, in religion as an aspect of the cultural environment. And yet in\nthe Watsuji scholarship there remains disagreement about how religion\n\u2014 Buddhism in particular \u2014 is to be read in his work\n(Sevilla 2016, 608\u2013609). William LaFleur remarks, for example, that\nWatsuji \u201cembraces a religious solution\u2026philosophically\nand methodologically\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 238). While David Dilworth\ncontends that \u201cWatsuji\u2019s position was not essentially a\nBuddhistic or religious one\u201d(Dilworth 1974, 17). While there is\ndisagreement on LaFleur\u2019s claim that \u201cit was in the\nBuddhist notion of emptiness that Watsuji found the principle that\ngives his system\u2026coherence\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 239), it\ncannot be denied that when Watsuji writes of emptiness as that final\nplace or context in which all distinctions disappear, or empty, and\nyet from which they emerge, that this notion is at least partly rooted\nin his study of Buddhist philosophy and culture, and the concept of\nemptiness in particular. Watsuji \u201cembraces a religious\nsolution\u2026philosophically and methodologically\u201d (LaFleur\n1978, 238).The Buddhist notion of\nprat\u00eetya-samutp\u00e2da, or \u2018dependent\nco-origination\u2019 (or \u2018relationality,\u2019\n\u2018conditioned co-production,\u2019 \u2018dependent\nco-arising,\u2019 \u2018co-dependent origination\u2019) implies\nthat everything is \u2018empty\u2019 that is to say, \u201cthat\neverything is deprived of its substantiality, nothing exists\nindependently, everything is related to everything else, nothing ranks\nas a first cause, and even the self is but a delusory\nconstruction\u201d (Abe 1985, 153). The delusion of independent\nindividuality can be overcome by recognizing our radical relational\ninterconnectedness. At the same time, even this negation must be\nemptied or negated, hence our radical relational interconnectedness is\npossible only because true individuals have created a network in the\nbetweenness between them. The result is a selfless awareness of that\ntotality beyond all limited, social totalities, namely the emptiness\nor nothingness at the bottom of all things, whether individual or\ngroup. LaFleur summarises Watsuji\u2019s position: \u201cthe social\nside of human existence \u2018empties\u2019 the individuated side of\nany possible priority or autonomy and the individuated side does\nsomething exactly the same and exactly proportionate to and for the\nsocial side. There can be no doubt, I think, that for Watsuji,\nemptiness is the key to it all\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 250).\nWatsuji\u2019s emptiness is more a recognition of underlying\nrelatedness, and manifests as a place, a basho, that is the\ndynamic and creative origination of all relationships and all networks\nof interactions. However, it is important to keep in mind that even\nwhen Watsuji uses religious language (as in \u201cit is a religious\necstasy of the great emptiness\u201d (LaFleur 1978, 249), that\necstasy is not a mystical-like insight into one\u2019s union with God\nor the Absolute or a recognition of floating in\n\u2018other-power,\u2019 but a relational union of those persons\ninvolved in some communal forms, eventually culminating in the state.\nIt is an ethical, or political, or communal ecstasy and not a\nreligious identification with a transcendent Other \u2013 and as much as\nwe hear the influence of Buddhism, we also hear, for example, echoed\nof the Hegelian concept of sublation (Sevilla 2016, 626). Watsuji\ngives no evidence of deep religiosity but expresses a profound and\nsometimes ecstatic ethical humanism, one which is, nonetheless,\nsignificantly Buddhist in conception. \n\nIn denying the reality of the subject/object distinction, and\naffirming the emptiness of all things, Watsuji was able to argue that\nas the individual negates or rebels against society, thereby emptying\nsociety of an unchanging objective status, and as the second negation\nestablishes the totality of society by emptying the individual, it\nreduces the individual ego to emptiness as well. Neither of the dual\ncharacteristics of ningen are either unchanging or ultimately\nreal. What is ultimate is the emptiness which is revealed as their\nbasis, for all things are empty, and yet, once this truth is realized,\nit is as individuals and societies that nothingness is expressed and\nrevealed. Emptiness negates itself, or empties itself as the beings of\nthis world. And it does this in the emptiness of betweenness, the\nempty space within which relations between individuals and societies\nform and continue to re-form. The state, as the culminating social\norganization thus far achieved, is the form of forms,\n\u201ctranscending all the other levels of social\norganization\u2026giving to each of those protected forms a proper\nplace\u201d (LaFleur 1994, 457). The state is, ultimately, \u201cthe\nmoral systematiser of all those organizations\u201d (LaFleur, french,\n457). However, the problem of the proper relation of the individual to\nsociety emerges, for Watsuji goes on to argue that \u201cthe state\nsubsumes within itself all these forms of private life and continually\nturns them into the form of the public domain\u201d (LaFleur 1994,\n457). In attempting to move away from the selfishness of egoistic\naction, Watsuji has given primacy to the state over individual and\ngroup rights. As LaFleur states, \u201cby valorizing the state as\nthat entity that has the moral authority\u2014in fact the moral\nobligation\u2014to \u2018turn private things into the public domain,\nWatsuji provides a smooth rationale for a totalizing state\u201d\n(LaFleur 1994, 458). Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that his\nintent was not to advocate tyranny or fascism, but to seek out an\nethical and social theory whereby human beings as human beings could\ninteract easily and fruitfully in the space between them, creating as\na result a society, and a world-wide association of societies which\nselflessly recognized the value of the individual and the crucial\nimportance of the well-being of the whole. His solution may have been\ninadequate, and open to unwelcome misuse. His analysis of\n\u2018betweenness\u2019 shows it to be communality, and communality\nas a mutuality wherein each individual may affect every other\nindividual and thereby affect the community or communities; and the\ncommunity, as an historical expression of the whole may affect each\nindividual. Ideally, what would result would be an enlightened sense\nof our interconnectedness with all human beings, regardless of race,\ncolor, religion, or creed, and a selfless, compassionate capacity to\nidentify with others as though they were oneself. By reintroducing a\nvivial sense of our communitarian interconnectedness, and our spatial\nand bodily place in the betweenness between us, where we meet, love,\nand strive to live ethical lives together, Watsuji provides an ethical\nand political theory which might well prove to be helpful both to\nnon-Japanese societies, and to a modern Japan itself which is torn\nbetween what it was, and what it is becoming.
