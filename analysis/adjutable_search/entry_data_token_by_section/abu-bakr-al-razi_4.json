    "main_text": "Religion and Prophecy\n5. Religion and Prophecy\n\nIf the five eternal theory was considered problematic by\ncontemporaries and later authors, al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s views on\nreligion were considered utterly outrageous and heretical. In his\nProofs of Prophecy, Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim selectively\nquotes and paraphrases from a work by al-R\u0101z\u012b on this topic,\nand presents him as having flatly denied the validity of prophetic\nrevelation. Accepting this evidence as more or less reliable, some\nmodern-day scholars have celebrated al-R\u0101z\u012b as a\n\u201cfreethinker\u201d comparable with such daringly unorthodox\nthinkers as Ibn al-R\u0101wand\u012b (Urvoy 1996, Stroumsa 1999), or\neven as having had pagan sympathies (Vallat 2015a, 2015b, 2016).\nAgainst this, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b quotes our\nal-R\u0101z\u012b as having offered interpretations of the\nQur\u02be\u0101n, which were designed to show that this revelatory\ntext and indeed the whole history of prophecy was in agreement with\nhis own philosophy (this evidence is presented and discussed in Rashed\n2000, 2008). The bio-bibliographical tradition is also ambiguous in\nits evidence. For instance al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, who clearly\nadmired al-R\u0101z\u012b, admits that he made foolish and obstinate\nremarks about religion and prophecy. But another broadly favorable\nwitness, Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aybi\u02bfa, says that a supposed work\nattacking religion was perhaps written by \u201cmalicious enemies of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b and ascribed to him\u201d (for references, see\nAdamson 2021: 11).\n\nThe most ample, if not necessarily trustworthy, evidence is found in\nAb\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim. He says that in face-to-face debate,\nal-R\u0101z\u012b argued against prophecy on the grounds that it would\nbe unjust to single out only some people for knowledge that is useful\nby everyone. Furthermore, appointing only a certain few as religious\nleaders (im\u0101ms) would lead to dissension between their\nfollowers (Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim, AHR: 1). Followers of religious\nlaw are guilty of the cardinal intellectual sin of the Islamic world,\ntaql\u012bd, which means uncritically adopting beliefs on the\nbasis of authority (AHR: 24). Instead, al-R\u0101z\u012b argues, God\ngives reason (\u02bfaql) to everyone, and in this respect\neveryone is created equal, able to determine for themselves what goals\nthey should be pursuing. Furthermore, Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim tells\nus about a range of more specific religious teachings rejected by\nal-R\u0101z\u012b in his book against prophecy, such as\nanthropomorphic descriptions of God and the possibility of miracles,\nincluding the inimitability of the Qur\u02be\u0101n\n(i\u02bfj\u0101z).\n\nIn several respects this teaching on prophecy fits well with what we\nknow of al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s philosophy more generally. It\ninvokes the idea that reason is given to the soul as a gift from God,\nsomething confirmed in other sources and suggested at the beginning of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s Spiritual Medicine. Furthermore,\nAb\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim has al-R\u0101z\u012b arguing that God would\nnot send prophets because this is an unreasonable and overly difficult\nway to achieve His goals (Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim, AHR: 1;\n131\u20132). Why not just give everyone the ability to figure things\nout for themselves? This same premise that God only proceeds in the\nmost rational way is also important in his theodicy as we know it from\nother sources, as seen above. Furthermore the critique of\ntaql\u012bd, while admittedly commonplace, does sound like it\ncould come from al-R\u0101z\u012b: his irreverent approach to Galen\nbears witness to a similar independence of mind, albeit in a very\ndifferent context.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence presented by Fakhr al-D\u012bn casts\nserious doubt on the notion that al-R\u0101z\u012b was openly hostile\nto the Islamic revelation. And this is backed up by evidence internal\nto al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s own surviving works, for instance\nacknowledgment of the preeminent value of \u201cbooks sent by\nGod\u201d in Doubts about Galen (al-R\u0101z\u012b, DG:\n\u00a72.1). At a minimum it seems clear that al-R\u0101z\u012b was a\nforthright rationalist, who believed that the truth of a revelatory\ntext would necessarily accord with the truth discoverable by human\nreason. But that position would not be so remarkable: it is shared\nfrom other philosophers of the Islamic world, from al-Kind\u012b to\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b to Ibn Rushd. The question is whether\nal-R\u0101z\u012b went further and insisted that revelation is\nuseless, or even counterproductive, as claimed by Ab\u016b\n\u1e24\u0101tim.\n\nRecent material brought to light by Philippe Vallat (2015a, 2015b,\n2016) could confirm this interpretation. It would show that\nal-R\u0101z\u012b said in debate with a theologian named Ab\u016b\nQ\u0101sim al-Balkh\u012b, also called al-Ka\u02bfb\u012b, that\n\u201cprophets are unnecessary, because we have reason which\nsuffices, assuming that prophecy is in accordance with reason\u201d\n(on al-Ka\u02bfb\u012b in general see El Omari 2016; and on their\ndebate Rashed 2000, Shihadeh 2006: 103). It has however been argued\nthat Vallat\u2019s new evidence cannot convincingly be linked to the\ndebate between al-Ka\u02bfb\u012b and al-R\u0101z\u012b, who is never\nnamed in these texts (Adamson 2021: 148\u2013151). A different\napproach would be to read Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim as having\ndistorted al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s position, which may have been a\nmore targeted attack on schismatic and controversialist groups\nincluding the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b branch of Islam to which\nAb\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim belonged. Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012blism is\ncharacterized by its insistence on the need for a religious leader or\nim\u0101m to guide the faithful to a true understanding of\nIslam. It may have been this doctrine, and not prophecy more\ngenerally, that al-R\u0101z\u012b attacked, as a signal example of the\ndangers of taql\u012bd (Mohaghegh 1970: 160\u20131; Adamson\n2021: 147).\n",
