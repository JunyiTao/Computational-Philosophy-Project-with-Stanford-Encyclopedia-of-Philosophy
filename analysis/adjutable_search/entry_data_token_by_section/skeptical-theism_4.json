Outweighing Goods and Inductive Inferences\n\nOne of the key claims of the outweighing goods argument is\nN-O1.2: there is at least one evil e such\nthat God\u2019s permission of e is not necessary for some outweighing\ngood. One way of defending this premise is to appeal to how things\nseem to us. But another way to defend\nN-O1.2 is to eschew talk of how things\nseem to us and use more traditional inductive inferences.\n",
