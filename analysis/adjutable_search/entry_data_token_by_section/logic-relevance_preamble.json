    "main_text": "\n\nRelevance logics are non-classical logics. Called\n\u2018relevant logics\u2019 in Britain and Australasia, these\nsystems developed as attempts to avoid the paradoxes of material and\nstrict implication. These so-called paradoxes are valid conclusions\nthat follow from the definitions of material and strict implication\nbut are seen, by some, as problematic.\n\nFor example, the material implication \\((p \\rightarrow q)\\)\nis true whenever \\(p\\) is false or \\(q\\) is true \u2014\ni.e., \\((\\neg p \\vee q)\\). So if \\(p\\) is true,\nthen the material implication is true when \\(q\\) is true. Among\nthe paradoxes of material implication are the following:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n& p \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow p), \\\\\n& \\neg p \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow q), \\\\\n& (p \\rightarrow q) \\vee(q \\rightarrow r).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe first asserts that every proposition implies a true one; the\nsecond that a false proposition implies every proposition, and the\nthird that for any three propositions, either the first implies the\nsecond or the second implies the third.\n\nSimilarly, the strict implication \\((p \\rightarrow q)\\) is\ntrue whenever it is not possible that \\(p\\) is true and\n\\(q\\) is false \u2014 i.e., \\(\\neg \\diamond(p \\amp \\neg q)\\). Among the paradoxes of strict implication are the\nfollowing:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n& (p \\amp \\neg p) \\rightarrow q, \\\\\n& p \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow q), \\\\\n& p \\rightarrow(q \\vee \\neg q).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe first asserts that a contradiction strictly implies every\nproposition; the second and third imply that every proposition\nstrictly implies a tautology.\n\nMany philosophers, beginning with Hugh MacColl (1908), have claimed\nthat these theses are counterintuitive. They claim that these formulae\nfail to be valid if we interpret \\(\\rightarrow\\) as representing the concept of\nimplication that we have before we learn classical logic. Relevance\nlogicians claim that what is unsettling about these so-called\nparadoxes is that in each of them the antecedent seems irrelevant to\nthe consequent.\n\nIn addition, relevance logicians have had qualms about certain\ninferences that classical logic makes valid. For example, consider the\nclassically valid inference\n\nThe moon is made of green cheese. Therefore, either it is raining in\nEcuador now or it is not.\n\n\nAgain here there seems to be a failure of relevance. The conclusion\nseems to have nothing to do with the premise. Relevance logicians have\nattempted to construct logics that reject theses and arguments that\ncommit \u201cfallacies of relevance\u201d.\n\nRelevant logicians point out that what is wrong with some of the\nparadoxes (and fallacies) is that the antecedents and consequents (or\npremises and conclusions) are on completely different topics. The\nnotion of a topic, however, would seem not to be something that a\nlogician should be interested in \u2014 it has to do with the\ncontent, not the form, of a sentence or inference. But there is a\nformal principle that relevant logicians apply to force theorems and\ninferences to \u201cstay on topic\u201d. This is the variable\nsharing principle. The variable sharing principle says that no\nformula of the form \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) can be proven in a relevance\nlogic if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do not have at least one propositional\nvariable (sometimes called a proposition letter) in common and that no\ninference can be shown valid if the premises and conclusion do not\nshare at least one propositional variable.\n\nAt this point some confusion is natural about what relevant logicians\nare attempting to do. The variable sharing principle is only a\nnecessary condition that a logic must have to count as a relevance\nlogic. It is not sufficient. Moreover, this principle does not give us\na criterion that eliminates all of the paradoxes and fallacies. Some\nremain paradoxical or fallacious even though they satisfy variable\nsharing. As we shall see, however, relevant logic does provide us with\na relevant notion of proof in terms of the real use of premises (see\nthe section \u201cProof Theory\u201d below), but it does not by\nitself tell us what counts as a true (and relevant) implication. It is\nonly when the formal theory is put together with a philosophical\ninterpretation that it can do this (see the section \u201cSemantics\nfor Relevant Implication\u201d below).\n\nIn this article we will give a brief and relatively non-technical\noverview of the field of relevance logic.\n",
