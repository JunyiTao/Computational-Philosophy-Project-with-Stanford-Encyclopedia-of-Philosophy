    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Agrippa, and the Five Modes\n4.3 Agrippa, and the Five Modes\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Agrippa (1st to\n2nd century CE; SE PH 1.164\u2013177; DL\n9.88\u201389). However, the modes of argument that Sextus calls the\nFive Modes are attributed to him. These modes are among the most\nfamous arguments of ancient skepticism (Barnes 1990, Hankinson\n2010).\n\n\n5\u20131 Diaph\u00f4nia:\n\nThe mode that argues from disagreement. With respect to some matter\nthat presents itself, there is undecided (anepikriton)\nconflict, both among the views of ordinary life and the views held by\nphilosophers. Due to this, we are unable to choose or reject one\nthing, and must fall back on suspension.\n\n5\u20132 Eis apeiron ekballonta:\n\nArguments that throw one into an infinite regress. That which\nis brought forward to make a given matter credible needs yet something\nelse to make it credible, and so on ad infinitum.\nSince we thus have no starting point for our argument, suspension of\njudgment follows.\n\n5\u20133 Pros ti:\n\nArguments from relativity. X only ever appears\nsuch-and-such in relation to the subject judging and to the things\nobserved together with it. Suspension on how X really is\nfollows.\n\n5\u20134 Hypothesis:\n\nSomeone makes an assumption without providing argument. A dogmatist,\nif thrown back into an infinite regress of arguments, just assumes\nsomething as a starting-point, without providing an argument\n(anapodeikt\u00f4s). We suspend over mere\nhypotheses\u2014they could be false, opposite hypotheses could be\nformulated, and so on.\n\n5\u20135 Ton diall\u00ealon:\n\nArguments that disclose a circularity. This mode is used when\nthat which ought to confirm a given investigated matter requires\nconfirmation (pistis\u2014credibility) from that matter. We\nare unable to assume either in order to establish the other. We\nsuspend judgment on both.\n\n\nIt is a commonplace to say that, while the Ten Modes, as presented in\nSextus, are concerned with conflicting appearances, the Five Modes are\nabout argument or proof. In these modes, the skeptics develop\nstrategies by which to attack theories that the dogmatists defend. If\nthis is how we characterize the Modes, Aristotle\u2019s objection\n(section 2.3) immediately comes to mind. Do the Five Modes reveal the\nskeptic\u2019s lack of understanding because they presuppose that\neverything is subject to proof? (Barnes 1990; Hankinson 1995,\n182\u201392; Long 2006, ch.3) The three so-called formal\nmodes\u2014Regress, Hypothesis, and Circularity\u2014can be\nconstrued in this fashion: when employing them, the skeptic can argue\nthat every premise must be supported by argument; if it is not so\nsupported, the theory begins from a mere hypothesis (on earlier uses\nof the term hupothesis in Plato and in medicine, cf. Cooper\n2002 [2004a]); or it is ultimately circular.\n\nHowever, the skeptic might not be vulnerable to this objection. First,\nthe Five Modes can be construed as dialectical, invoking dogmatic\ntheories of justification (Striker 2004). Second, they might be\nbroader in scope. 5\u20131 and 5\u20133\nexplore disagreement and relativity. Skeptical examination often\nbegins with the Mode of Disagreement: different answers to a given\nquestion are surveyed, and the conflict between them is observed. The\ninterpretation of 5\u20131 hangs, for the most part, on\nthe question of whether anepikriton should be translated as\n\u2018undecided\u2019 or \u2018undecidable\u2019 (Barnes 1990). It\nwould be dogmatic to claim that matters are undecidable. The\nPyrrhonist must prefer the idea that, up to now, matters have not been\ndecided. In applying the Mode of Disagreement, skeptics can\neither record a conflicting argument that others have formulated or\ncome up with an argument that disagrees with a view formulated by a\ndogmatist (cf. Sienkiewicz 2019, 47\u201351). This leads to the question of\nwhether something can be found that would decide matters, and thus to\nthe application of further modes. Scholars have observed that\n5\u20133, the Mode of Relativity, does not really fit into\nthe Five Modes. However, the Five Modes could be designed to supersede\nand include the Ten Modes, and 5\u20133 might be viewed as\ncapturing the common thread of the Ten Modes. With the help of\n5\u20133, the skeptic can argue that the premises that\ntheorists employ are formulated from particular points of view, in\nparticular contexts, and so on (for a reading that emphasizes the role\nof the first mode at the expense of the role of the third, cf.\nSienkiewicz 2019).\n\nThird, even the so-called formal modes (5-2,\n5\u20134, 5\u20135) might not be narrowly\nconcerned with proof, but rather with everything that can lend\ncredibility to something else. Consider Regress\n(5\u20132), the first of the formal modes. The text does\nnot actually speak of proof (apodeixis) (this is obscured by\nBury\u2019s Loeb translation; 5\u20134 is the only place\nin Sextus\u2019 report of the Five Modes that uses a cognate of\napodeixis). Sextus\u2019 language is wider: the mode deals\nwith everything that can make something else credible. We might read\nthis in the context of the Hellenistic view that proof is a species of\nsign (PH 2.122). A sign reveals something non-evident. Smoke\nthat reveals fire has, from this point of view, a function and\nstructure that is similar to a proof. The target of the Five Modes\nmight be sign-inferences in general. If this is so, then their target\nmight include what we would call inductive reasoning and causal\nexplanations (when Sextus introduces a further set of modes, the\nCausal Modes, he says that they are not really needed, because the\nrelevant work can be done by the Five Modes; PH\n1.180\u201386). Taken together, the Five Modes deny all \u201cproof,\ncriterion, sign, cause, movement, learning, coming into being, and\nthat there is anything by nature good or bad.\u201d (DL 9.90). This\nis notably more than just proof. Indeed, it is an excellent summary of\nthe key topics in Sextus\u2019 discussions of logic, physics, and\nethics.\n",
