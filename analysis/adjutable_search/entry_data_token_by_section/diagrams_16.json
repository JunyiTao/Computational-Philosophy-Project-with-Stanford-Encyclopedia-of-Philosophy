This question has a long history both in\nphilosophy and in psychology, independently of each other. More\nrecently, however, some philosophers have participated in this\n\u201cimagery debate\u201d, one of the most time-honored\ncontroversies in psychology, and some cognitive psychologists find\ncertain epistemological theories in philosophy useful to support their\nviews on the issue.\n\nThe nature of mental representation has been one of the perennial\ntopics in philosophy, and we can easily trace back philosophical\ndiscussions on images and mental representation to ancient\n times.[13]\n The writings of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume concern themselves\nin large part with mental discourse, the meaning of words, mental\nimages, particular ideas, abstract ideas, impressions, and so on.\nDescartes\u2019 well-known distinction between imagining and\nconceiving something has generated much discussion about the unique\nrole of visual images in mental representations. The development of\ncognitive science in the 20th century naturally has brought certain\ngroup of philosophers and psychologists closer and we find a number of\nauthors whose works easily belong to both disciplines (Block\n 1983;\n Dennett\n 1981;\n Fodor\n 1981).\n\nImagery based on introspection was the main focus in the early\ndevelopment of psychology until the behavioristic approach became\npredominant in the discipline. During the era of behaviorism, anything\nrelated to mental inspection, including images, was excluded from any\nserious research agenda. Finally when the topic of mental images made\na comeback in psychology in 1960s, researchers adopted a more humble\nagenda for mental imagery than before: Not all mental representations\ninvolve imagery, and imagery is one of many ways of manipulating\ninformation in the mind. Also, thanks to the influence of behaviorism,\nit is acknowledged that introspection is not enough to explore\nimagery, but a claim about mental imagery needs to be confirmable by\nexperiments in order to show that we successfully externalize mental\nevents. That is, if what a certain mental introspection tells us is\ngenuine, then there would be observable external consequences of that\nmental state.\n\nThus the contemporary imagery debate among cognitive scientists is\nabout the claim that picture-like images exist as mental\nrepresentations and about how we interpret certain\n experiments.[14]\n\nKosslyn\n (1980,\n 1994) and other pictorialists (Shepard & Metzler\n 1971)\n present experimental data to support their position that some of our\nmental images are more like pictures than a linear form of language\n(for example, natural languages or artificial symbolic languages) in\nsome important aspects, even though not all visual mental images and\npictures are of exactly the same kind. By contrast, Pylyshyn\n (1981)\n and other descriptionalists (Dennett\n 1981)\n raise questions about the picture-like status of mental images and\nargue that mental images are formed out of structured descriptions. To\nthem, mental images represent in the manner of language rather than\npictures and, hence, there are no picture-like visual mental\nimages.\n\nBoth sides of the debate sometimes used a philosophical theory as a\nsupporting factor. For example, pictorialists in the imagery debate\nfound the modern sense-datum theory in philosophy quite close to their\npoint of view. By the same token, the critics of the sense-datum\ntheory argued that the mistaken pictorial view of mental images arises\nmainly from our confusion about ordinary language and claimed that\nmental images are epiphenomena.\n",
