    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nRosmini was born in 1797 at Rovereto, Italy, a staunchly\nItalian-speaking town, but at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire and ruled from Vienna. The Rosmini family, citizens of Rovereto\nfor several centuries, had become rich through the manufacture of silk,\nand enjoyed the way of life proper to the lesser aristocracy. \nAntonio\u2019s\nprimary and secondary education was, however, catered for at the public\nschool, and through his own intensive reading. Tertiary education was\ncompleted at the University of Padua. After ordination to the\npriesthood in 1821, Rosmini studied and wrote at Rovereto until 1826,\nand from 1826\u201328 at Milan. Despite his instinctive distaste for \nthe\nexcesses of the French Revolution, which inevitably played a large part\nin the cultural formation of persons growing to maturity in the first\nquarter of the 19th century, Rosmini was not afraid to take a stand\nagainst State interference in religious affairs. His \nPanegyric for Pius VII (1823) \nwas considerably censored by the\nAustrian-Hungarian government and published only in 1831. By this time,\nRosmini had founded his religious order (1828), and published at Rome\nhis fundamental philosophical work, \nA New Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas (1830). \nAs the title suggests, this was intended\nto supersede Locke\u2019s famous Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding. From then on, a torrent of philosophical and\ntheological works poured out until his death at Stresa. From 1836 until\n1855, Rosmini was involved in constant controversy. The approbation of\nhis religious order (1836\u201338), his work on conscience (1840),\ntheological disputes (1843\u201348) and his participation in the \npolitical\nevents of 1848, occasioned strong debate which led in 1849 to the\ninclusion of two of his works, The Five Wounds of Holy Church\nand the Civil Constitution according to Social Justice, in the\nIndex of Prohibited Books. Strengthened by this, \nRosmini\u2019s\ntheological and political opponents pressed for an examination of all\nhis works which led, however, to his exoneration (1854), a year before\nhis death at Stresa in northern Italy (1855). Condemnation came\nposthumously (1888\u20139) when forty propositions, taken mostly from \nbooks\npublished after his death, were included in the decree Post\nObitum of Leo XIII. A remarkable swing in ecclesiastical opinion\ntook place in 2001 when a Vatican Note stated: \u2018The\nmotives for preoccupation and for doctrinal and prudential difficulties\nwhich determined the promulgation of the decree Post Obitum\ncondemning the \u201cForty Propositions\u201d drawn from the works of \nAntonio\nRosmini can now be considered as surmounted\u2019 (CDF,\nOsservatore Romano, 1 July 2001).\n",
