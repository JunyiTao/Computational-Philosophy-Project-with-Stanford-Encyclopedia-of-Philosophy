    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\n\nWe are fortunate in having a list of titles of works ascribed to\nal-Kindi, which is found in the Fihrist of the tenth century\nbookseller Ibn al-Nadim. Thanks to Ibn al-Nadim we know that al-Kindi\nwrote hundreds of treatises on a very wide variety of scientific and\nphilosophical disciplines. Indeed the scientific and mathematical\ntitles far outnumber the philosophical titles. Many of the latter would\nnow be lost if not for a single manuscript, held in Istanbul, which\ncontains most of al-Kindi\u2019s extant philosophical writings (edited\nin Abu Rida 1950 and 1953; several important texts are edited and\ntranslated in Rashed and Jolivet 1998). This includes the work for\nwhich he is best known, On First Philosophy. Our version of\nthis treatise is incomplete, comprising only the first part, which is\ndivided into four sections. The first section is essentially an\nexhortation to the reader to honor Greek philosophical wisdom. The\nsecond contains al-Kindi\u2019s celebrated discussion of the eternity\nof the world. The third and fourth establish the existence of a\n\u201ctrue One,\u201d i.e. God, which is the source of unity in all\nother things, and consider the inapplicability of language to this true\nOne.\n\n\nThe Istanbul manuscript also includes one of the few copies of\nal-Kindi\u2019s On the Intellect to survive in Arabic (it is\nalso preserved in Latin translation). This is the first treatise in the\nArabic tradition to give a taxonomy of the types of intellect, such as\nwill become familiar in al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes. Other works\nshed further light on al-Kindi\u2019s psychology (i.e. theory of\nsoul): the Discourse on the Soul consists of supposed\nquotations from Greek philosophers, That There are Separate\nSubstances uses Aristotle\u2019s Categories to prove\nthat the soul is immaterial, and On Sleep and Dream gives an\naccount of prophetic dreams in terms of Aristotle\u2019s theory of the\nimagination. Related to al-Kindi\u2019s psychological theories is his\nonly significant surviving work on ethics, On Dispelling\nSorrows. (He also composed a collection of ethical anecdotes and\nsayings ascribed to Socrates, for which see Fakhry 1963.)\n\n\nAl-Kindi sets out his cosmological theories in two further texts\nfound in the same manuscript, On the Proximate Agent Cause of\nGeneration and Corruption and On the Prostration of the\nOutermost Sphere. Also relevant here are numerous works on\nmeteorology and weather forecasting. These apply the same cosmological\nideas to show how heavenly motion produces rain and other\nmeteorological phenomena in the lower world where we live. While these\nworks are influenced by Aristotle, al-Kindi also draws on other Greek\nsources, such as Ptolemy. His knowledge of the Greek scientific\ntradition was in fact extensive. For instance, he uses Euclid and ideas\nthat can be traced to Ptolemy in a well-known work on optics, On\nPerspectives, which is preserved only in Latin. Al-Kindi\u2019s\nextant scientific corpus is sizable and includes treatises on the\nmanufacture of drugs, music, astrology, and mathematics (see further\nRosenthal 1942). But the focus here will be on al-Kindi\u2019s\nphilosophical views.\n",
