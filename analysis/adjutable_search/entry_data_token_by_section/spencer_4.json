    "main_text": "Political Rights\n6. Conclusion\n\nAllan Gibbard has suggested that, for Sidgwick, in refining and\nsystematizing common sense, we transform \u201cunconscious\nutilitarianism\u201d into \u201cconscious utilitarianism.\u201d We\n\u201capply scientific techniques of felicific assessment to further\nthe achievement of the old, unconscious goal\u201d (Gibbard in Miller\nand Williams, eds., 1982: 72). Spencer\u2019s \u201cliberal\u201d\nutilitarianism was comparable moral science. Sidgwick, however, aimed\nsimply at \u201cprogress in the direction of a closer approximation\nto a perfectly enlightened Utilitarianism\u201d (Sidgwick, 1907:\n455). Spencer, by contrast, had more grandiose aspirations for\nrepairing utilitarianism. Merely moving towards \u201cperfectly\nenlightened Utilitarianism\u201d was scientifically under ambitious.\nFully \u201cenlightened\u201d utilitarianism was conceptually\naccessible and perhaps even politically practicable. And Spencer had\ndiscovered its secret, namely indefeasible moral rights.\n\nSpencer, then, merits greater esteem if for no other reason than that\nSidgwick, besides Mill, took him so seriously as a fellow utilitarian\nworthy of his critical attention. Unfortunately, contemporary\nintellectual history has been less kind, preferring a more convenient\nand simplistic narrative of the liberal canon that excludes him.\n\nSpencer\u2019s \u201cliberal\u201d utilitarianism was bolder and\narguably more unstable than either Mill or Sidgwick\u2019s. He\nfollowed Mill investing utilitarianism with robust moral rights hoping\nto keep it ethically appealing without forgoing its systemic\ncoherence. While the principle of utility retreats to the background\nas a standard of overall normative assessment, moral rights serve as\neveryday sources of direct moral obligation, making Spencer no less an\nindirect utilitarian than Mill. But Spencer\u2019s indirect\nutilitarianism is more volatile, more logically precarious, because\nSpencer burdened rights with indefeasibility while Mill made them\nstringent but nevertheless overridable depending on the magnitude of\nthe utility at stake. For Spencer, we never compromise basic rights\nlet the heavens fall. But for Mill, the prospect of collapsing heavens\nwould easily justify appealing directly to the principle of utility at\nthe expense of respect for moral rights.\n\nNow, critics of utilitarianism from William Whewell (1794\u20131866)\nto David Lyons more recently have taken Mill and subsequent liberal\nutilitarians to task for trying to have their utilitarian cake and eat\ntheir liberalism too. As Lyons argues with great effect, by imposing\nliberal juridical constraints on the pursuit of general utility, Mill\nintroduces as a second normative criterion with independent\n\u201cmoral force\u201d compromising his utilitarianism. He risks\nembracing value pluralism if not abandoning utilitarianism altogether.\nAnd if Mill\u2019s liberal version of utilitarianism is just value\npluralism in disguise, then he still faces the further dilemma of how\nto arbitrate conflicts between utility and rights. If utility trumps\nrights only when enough of it is at stake, we must still ask how much\nenough is enough? And any systematic answer we might give simply\ninjects another normative criterion into the problematic logic of our\nliberal utilitarian stew since we have now introduced a third higher\ncriterion that legislates conflicts between the moral force of the\nprinciple of utility and the moral force of\n rights.[21]\n\nIf these dilemmas hold for Mill\u2019s utilitarianism, then the\nimplications are both better and worse for Spencer. Though for Mill,\nutility always trumps rights when enough of the former is in jeopardy,\nwith Spencer, fundamental rights always trump utility no matter how\nmuch of the latter is imperiled. Hence, Spencer does not need to\nintroduce surreptitiously supplemental criteria for adjudicating\nconflicts between utility and rights because rights are indefeasible,\nnever giving way to the demands of utility or disutility no matter how\nimmediate and no matter how promising or how catastrophic. In short,\nfor Spencer, basic moral rights always carry the greater, practical\n(if not formal) moral force. Liberalism always supersedes\nutilitarianism in practice no matter how insistently Spencer feigns\nloyalty to the latter.\n\nNaturally, one can salvage this kind of utilitarianism\u2019s\nauthenticity by implausibly contending that indefeasible moral rights\nalways (meaning literally without exception) work out for the\nutilitarian best over both the short and long-terms. As Wayne Sumner\ncorrectly suggests, \u201cabsolute rights are not an impossible\noutput for a consequentialist methodology\u201d (Sumner, 1987: 211).\nWhile this maneuver would certainly rescue the logical integrity of\nSpencer\u2019s liberal version of utilitarianism, it does so at the\ncost of considerable common sense credibility. And even if it were\nmiraculously true that respecting rights without exception just\nhappened to maximize long-term utility, empirically demonstrating this\ntruth would certainly prove challenging at best. Moreover,\nnotwithstanding this maneuver\u2019s practical plausibility, it would\nnevertheless seem to cause utilitarianism to retire a \u201cresidual\nposition\u201d that is indeed hardly \u201cworth calling\nutilitarianism\u201d (Williams in Smart and Williams, 1973: 135).\n\nWhether Spencer actually envisioned his utilitarianism this way is\nunclear. In any case, insofar as he also held that social evolution\nwas tending towards human moral perfectibility, he could afford to\nworry less and less about whether rights-based utilitarianism was a\nplausible philosophical enterprise. Increasing moral perfectibility\nmakes secondary decision procedures like basic moral rights\nunnecessary as a utility-promoting strategy. Why bother with promoting\ngeneral utility indirectly once we have learned to promote it directly\nwith certainty of success? Why bother with substitute sources of\nstand-in obligation when, thanks to having become moral saints, act\nutilitarianism will fortunately always do? But moral\nperfectibility\u2019s unlikelihood is no less plausible than the\nlikelihood of fanatical respect for basic moral rights always working\nout for the utilitarian\n best.[22]\n In any case, just as the latter strategy causes utilitarianism to\nretire completely for practical purposes, so the former strategy\namounts to liberalism entirely retiring in turn. Hence, Mill\u2019s\nversion of \u201cliberal\u201d utilitarianism must be deemed more\ncompelling and promising for those of us who remain stubbornly drawn\nto this problematical philosophical enterprise.\n\nSpencer\u2019s rights-based utilitarianism nonetheless has much to\nrecommend for it despite its unconventional features and implausible\nimplications. Even more than Mill, he suggests how liberal\nutilitarians could attempt to moderate utilitarianism in other ways,\nenabling it to retain a certain measure of considerable ethical\nappeal. Spencer\u2019s utilitarianism wears its liberalism not only\nby constraining the pursuit of utility externally by deploying robust\nmoral rights with palpable independent moral force. It also, and more\nsuccessfully, shows how utilitarians can liberalize their\nutilitarianism by building internal constraints into their maximizing\naims. If, following Spencer, we make our maximizing goal\ndistribution-sensitive by including everyone\u2019s happiness within\nit so that each individual obtains his or her fair share, then we have\nsalvaged some kind of consequentialist authenticity while\nsimultaneously securing individual integrity too. We have salvaged\nutilitarianism as a happiness-promoting, if not a\nhappiness-maximizing, consequentialism. Because everyone is \u201cto\ncount for one, nobody for more than one\u201d not just as a resource\nfor generating utility but also as deserving to experience a share of\nit, no one may be sacrificed callously without limit for the good of\nthe\n rest.[23]\n No one may be treated as a means only but must be treated as an end\nas well.\n\nSpencer\u2019s utilitarianism also has much to recommend for it\nsimply for its much undervalued importance in the development of\nmodern liberalism. If Mill and Sidgwick are critical to making sense\nof our liberal canon, then Spencer is no less critical. If both are\ncrucial for coming to terms with Rawls particularly, and consequently\nwith post-Rawlsianism generally, as I strongly believe both are, then\nSpencer surely deserves better from recent intellectual history.\nIntellectual history is one of the many important narratives we tell\nand retell ourselves. What a shame when we succumb to scholarly\nlaziness in constructing these narratives just because such laziness\nboth facilitates meeting the pedagogical challenges of teaching the\nliberal tradition and answering our need for a coherent philosophical\nidentity.\n",
