    "main_text": "The method of intuition\n3. The method of intuition\n\nAs we already noted, Bergson\u2019s thought must be seen as an\nattempt to overcome Kant. In Bergson\u2019s eyes, Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy is scandalous, since it eliminates the possibility of\nabsolute knowledge and mires metaphysics in antinomies.\nBergson\u2019s own method of intuition is supposed to restore the\npossibility of absolute knowledge \u2013 here one should see a\nkinship between Bergsonian intuition and what Kant calls intellectual\nintuition \u2013 and metaphysics. To do this, intuition in\nBergson\u2019s sense must place us above the divisions of the\ndifferent schools of philosophy like rationalism and empiricism or\nidealism and realism. Philosophy, for Bergson, does not consist in\nchoosing between concepts and in taking sides (The Creative\nMind, p. 175\u201376). These antinomies of concepts and\npositions, according to him, result from the normal or habitual way\nour intelligence works. Here we find Bergson\u2019s connection to\nAmerican pragmatism. The normal way our intelligence works is guided\nby needs and thus the knowledge it gathers is not disinterested; it is\nrelative knowledge. And how it gathers knowledge is through what\nBergson calls \u201canalysis,\u201d that is, the dividing of things\naccording to perspectives taken. Comprehensive analytic knowledge then\nconsists in reconstruction or re-composition of a thing by means of\nsynthesizing the perspectives. This synthesis, while helping us\nsatisfy needs, never gives us the thing itself; it only gives us a\ngeneral concept of things. Thus, intuition reverses the normal working\nof intelligence, which is interested and analytic (synthesis being\nonly a development of analysis). In the fourth chapter to Matter\nand Memory, Bergson calls this reversal of habitual intelligence\n\u201cthe turn of experience\u201d where experience becomes\nconcerned with utility, where it becomes human experience (Matter and\nMemory, pp.184\u201385). This placement of oneself up above the turn\nis not easy; above all else, Bergson appreciates effort.\n\nIntuition therefore is a kind of experience, and indeed Bergson\nhimself calls his thought \u201cthe true empiricism\u201d (The\nCreative Mind, p. 175). What sort of experience? In the opening pages\nof \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d he calls intuition\nsympathy (The Creative Mind, p. 159). As we have seen from our\ndiscussion of multiplicity in Time and Free Will, sympathy\nconsists in putting ourselves in the place of others. Bergsonian\nintuition then consists in entering into the thing, rather than going\naround it from the outside. This \u201centering into,\u201d for\nBergson, gives us absolute knowledge. In a moment, we are going to\nhave to qualify this \u201cabsoluteness.\u201d In any case, for\nBergson, intuition is entering into ourselves \u2013 he says we seize\nourselves from within \u2013 but this self-sympathy develops\nheterogeneously into others. In other words, when one sympathizes with\noneself, one installs oneself within duration and then feels a\n\u201ccertain well defined tension, whose very determinateness seems\nlike a choice between an infinity of possible durations\u201d (The\nCreative Mind, p. 185). In order to help us understand intuition,\nwhich is always an intuition of duration, let us return to the color\nspectrum image. Bergson says that we should suppose that perhaps there\nis no other color than orange. Yet, if we could enter into orange,\nthat is, if we could sympathize with it, we would \u201csense\nourselves caught,\u201d as Bergson says, \u201cbetween red and\nyellow.\u201d This means that if we make an effort when we perceive\norange, we sense a variety of shades. If we make more of an effort, we\nsense that the darkest shade of orange is a different color, red,\nwhile the lightest is also a different color, yellow. Thus, we would\nhave a sense, beneath orange, of the whole color spectrum. So,\nlikewise, I may introspect and sympathize with my own duration; my\nduration may be the only one. But, if I make an effort, I sense in my\nduration a variety of shades. In other words, the intuition of\nduration puts me in contact with a whole continuity of durations,\nwhich I could, with effort, try to follow upwardly or downwardly,\nupward to spirit or downward to inert matter (The Creative\nMind, p. 187). Thus Bergsonian intuition is always an intuition\nof what is other. Here we see that Bergson has not only tried to break\nwith Kant, but also with Parmenides\u2019s philosophy of the\nsame.\n\nBefore, we leave this discussion, it is important to realize that\nintuition, understood as my self-sympathy, like the one color orange,\nis what Bergson calls a \u201ccomponent part\u201d (The Creative\nMind, pp. 170\u201372). Just as the color orange is a real part of\nthe color spectrum \u2014 the mathematical equation which defines the\nlight waves of orange, on the contrary, being not a component part,\nfor Bergson, but a \u201cpartial expression\u201d \u2013 my own\nduration is a real part of the duration itself. From this\npart, I can, as Bergson would say, \u201cdilate\u201d or\n\u201cenlarge\u201d and move into other durations. But this starting\npoint in a part implies \u2013 and Bergson himself never seems to\nrealize this\u2013 that intuition never gives us absolute knowledge\nof the whole of the duration, all the component parts of the\nduration. The whole is never given in an intuition; only a\ncontracted part is given. Nevertheless, this experience is an integral\none, in the sense of integrating an infinity of durations. And thus,\neven though we cannot know all durations, every single one that comes\ninto existence must be related, as a part, to the others. The\nduration is that to which everything is related and in this sense it\nis absolute.\n\nBecause intuition in Bergson is \u201cintegral experience\u201d\n(The Creative Mind, p. 200), it is made up of an indefinite\nseries of acts, which correspond to the degrees of duration. This\nseries of acts is why Bergson calls intuition a method. The first act\nis a kind of leap, and the idea of a leap is opposed to the idea of a\nre-constitution after analysis. One should make the effort to reverse\nthe habitual mode of intelligence and set oneself up immediately in\nthe duration. But then, second, one should make the effort to dilate\none\u2019s duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Third, one\nshould make the effort to differentiate (as with the color orange) the\nextremes of this heterogeneity. With the second and third steps, one\ncan see a similarity to Plato\u2019s idea of dialectic understood as\ncollection and division. The method resembles that of the good butcher\nwho knows how to cut at the articulations or the good tailor who knows\nhow to sew pieces of cloth together into clothes that fit. On the\nbasis of the division into extremes or into a duality, one can then\nconfront our everyday \u201cmixtures\u201d of the two extremes.\nWithin the mixture, one makes a division or \u201ccut\u201d into\ndifferences in kind: into matter and spirit, for instance. Then one\nshows how the duality is actually a monism, how the two extremes are\n\u201csewn\u201d together, through memory, in the continuous\nheterogeneity of duration. Indeed, for Bergson, intuition is memory;\nit is not perception.\n",
