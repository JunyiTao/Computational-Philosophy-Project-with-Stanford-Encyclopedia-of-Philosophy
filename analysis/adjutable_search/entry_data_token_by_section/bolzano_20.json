Bolzano, however,\nmodified and justified it in an original way and consistently applied\nit to many different areas. By the supreme moral law Bolzano means\n\u201ca practical truth [i.e., a true ought proposition] from which\nevery other practical truth [\u2026] can be derived\nobjectively, i.e., as the consequence from its\n\u2018ground\u2019\u201d (RW I, 228; cf. also RW I, 44, 244, 256,\nRW IV, 27, 217, 221, and WL II, 348, WL IV, 178). Thus, on the basis\nof the asymmetry of Bolzano\u2019s entailment relation\n(Abfolge), the supreme moral law must be an ought proposition\nthat does not objectively follow from (i.e., it is not entailed by)\nany other ought proposition. It must therefore be a basic truth, i.e.,\na truth that does not have an objective \u201cground\u201d,\nbut can only \\(be\\) an objective \u201cground\u201d of other\n(practical) truths (WL II, 375, RW I, 229, RW IV, 207).\n\nBolzano\u2019s supreme moral law consists in the utilitarian\nrequirement of advancing the general welfare (RW IV, 206, 227, 236;\nBolzano 1836, 23, 43; WL IV, 26 f., 178). Briefly, this supreme moral\nlaw is formulated thus: \u201cStrive to bring about the greatest\namount of happiness\u201d (RW I, 250), or: \u201cAlways act as the\nbest for all or the welfare of the whole demands\u201d (RW IV, 216,\nalso 218, 221, and 229). On the basis of careful considerations,\nBolzano arrives at the following definitive version of his\nsupreme moral law: \n\nAlways choose from all actions that are possible for you the one\nwhich, all consequences considered, most advances the welfare of the\nwhole, in whatever parts (RW I, 236; cf. WL IV, 119).\n\n\nBolzano specifies the content of the thus obtained formulation of the\nsupreme moral law in several respects (RW I, 235). His explanations\nexhibit a remarkable awareness of problems. Thus, he points out that\nall sentient beings are equal and must be equally involved in the\nincrease of happiness or decrease of suffering (RW I, 235). The\naddendum that this goes for beings \u201cfor whom there are no\nvarying degrees of virtue\u201d indicates that Bolzano would allow\nfor certain distinctions in the case of beings which are capable of\nbeing virtuous (and for which there are consequently also differences\nof degree in regard to kinds of happiness which other beings cannot\nappreciate). The capacity of being virtuous is therefore \u2014 no\nless than sentience \u2014 a morally relevant quality for him. In\nthis Bolzano agrees with considerations in contemporary ethics,\naccording to which the quality of personhood is, in addition to\nsentience, morally relevant.\n\nBolzano stresses that, in assessing an action according to the\nprinciple of advancing the general welfare, one must \u201cnot only\nlook at its proximate consequences, but also at further ones\u201d\n(RW I, 237). Since we can never know all the consequences of an\naction, the principle of advancing the general welfare demands that we\nalways decide in favor of the action which seems most conducive to the\nwelfare of the whole according to those consequences thereof which\nwe can foresee arising from it (RW I, 241). With a similar\nargument Bolzano replies to the objection that according to his\nprinciple the moral value of our actions would depend on mere\nchance, as the following example seems to show: \u201cIf someone\nwith the intention of killing his neighbor drew a dagger against him,\nbut accidentally only opened a boil and this were now healed thereby,\nhe would have performed a good work\u201d. This view, however, rests\non a misunderstanding, according to Bolzano, since for him \u201cthe\nmoral goodness of an action (i.e., its claim to being\nrewardable) is always a matter of whether the action has been\nundertaken with a view to agreeing with the law\u201d (RW I,\n240).\n",
