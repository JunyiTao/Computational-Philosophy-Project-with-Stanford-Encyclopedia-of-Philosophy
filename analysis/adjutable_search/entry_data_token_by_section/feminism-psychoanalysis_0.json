    "main_text": "The Freudian Riddle of Femininity\n1. The Freudian Riddle of Femininity\n\nRooted in both clinical practice with patients and speculative\nattempts to apprehend and delineate foundational concepts,\nFreud\u2019s psychoanalysis aims to offer descriptions of psychical\nstructures that underlie and account for individual experience in the\nvariety of its empirical formations. Rather than the rationally\nself-interested individual presumed by liberal political theory or the\nself-contained and independent cogito presumed by Cartesian\nepistemology, Freud puts forward a divided subject, unknown to itself,\nan \u2018I\u2019 traversed by multiple\nagencies. According to Kristeva,\n\u201cFreud\u2019s discovery designated sexuality as the nexus\nbetween language and society, drives and the socio-symbolic\norder\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 84]). Freud\u2019s break-through\ninsight, in other words, is that sexual bonds initiate us into\nsubjectivity and civilization.\n\nFreud distinguishes human drives from instincts insofar as drives\n(unlike instincts) have no pre-given aim or object supplied by nature\nand follow no pre-set biological path.  For those who\ninhabit a human world, drives might come to be attached to any number\nof aims or objects, and felt through any number of bodily locales.\nDrives, according to Freud, become specified in these ways through the\nmediation of ideas or representations. Human embodiment is thus imbued\nwith opaque meaning, and sexuality emerges from a kind of instinctual\ninadequacy that presents desire as a difficulty or problem, and\npropels its increasing complexification.\n\nThe core of Freud\u2019s claim about the impact of sexuality on\npsychic processes can be discerned starting with Freud\u2019s early\nworks on hysteria, although a crucial transformation in his thinking\nmust be clarified. In Studies in Hysteria (1895),\nwritten in collaboration with Josef Breuer, Freud examines the\nphenomenon whereby a symptom might exist in the absence of an organic\nlesion. Hysteria is diagnosed when it is an idea or memory that makes\none ill, without any physical disease being the cause. By definition,\nhysteria is ideogenic (caused by an idea), as it designates the\nprocess by which a troubling but repressed idea is converted into a\nbodily symptom. Freud initially posits that hysterical symptoms arise\nas a result of violent childhood seduction (what today would be called\nmolestation), a real trauma that is then retroactively set in motion\nby a second, comparatively more mild, event, after a period of\nlatency. The \u2018seduction hypothesis\u2019 is an attempt to\nexplain the aetiology of hysteria (the origins of neurosis) by the\ntraumatic force of a premature sexual experience occurring in early\nchildhood, an external event that impinges upon the psychical\napparatus but whose memory is repressed, cut off from consciousness.\nThe repressed memory becomes somatized (enacted on the body and in\nbodily symptoms) when a later event, usually occurring in puberty,\ncatalyzes the earlier memory traces. The talking cure is developed as\na way to bring repressed memories forward and abreact or release them,\nre-binding the idea to its severed and dispersed affect (unrepressing\nit) and thereby dissolving the bodily symptom.\n\nIn the later Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905a),\nFreud contends, contrary to the earlier supposition that sexuality\nintervenes from the outside, that sexuality is a primordial and innate\n(if also inchoate) force of infantile life, arising from the bodily\nsensations that accompany the life processes. In the interim between\nthese two works, Freud had abandoned the seduction hypothesis and\nreplaced it with the thesis of infantile sexuality and the idea that\nsymptoms are brought about via the conflicts and repressions of\nunconscious fantasy. In other words, it is no longer repressed memory\nthat makes one ill and traumatic sexual violence no longer figures as\nthe primary cause of symptoms. Instead of an actual past experience,\nFreud posits fantasy as the determining factor of neurotic symptoms.\nTo understand the significance of this transition in his thinking, we\nmust grasp what Freud means by psychical reality and its distinction\nfrom material reality. In contrast to the historical, intersubjective\ndomain of material reality, psychical reality is the vital domain of\nfantasy and intra-psychic life, operating independently of objective\nconsiderations of veracity. In Freud\u2019s view, unconscious\nfantasies are not lies or deceptions, but reveal a truth, not about\nthe objective world, but about the internal life of the subject, who\none is and what one wants. It might be better to say that fantasies\nconceal this truth, since conscious articulations of desire and\nidentity will often lead us astray, expressing but distorting,\nmanifesting but denying, the subject\u2019s wishes.\n\nAs Freud documents in \u201cRemembering, Repeating, and\nWorking-Through\u201d (1914b), the conjectural move from memory to\ndesire and from fact to fantasy is also a move from external scenes of\nseduction to internal psychical acts, from past events to present-day\nforces, and from passive submission to active maintenance of discord.\nInstead of an external event impinging upon a child\u2019s\nundeveloped sexuality, the idea of infantile sexuality presupposes\nboth an energetic drive force at work from earliest childhood and an\ninternal or intrapsychic dissension, a subject at odds with its own\ndesires. The thesis of infantile sexuality universalizes the event of\ntrauma, locating its experience in the instinctual excitations that\noverwhelm the psychical apparatus which is prematurely affected. In\ndiscarding the seduction hypothesis, Freud not only discovers the\ndomain of fantasy and psychical reality, but he also paves the way for\nconsidering the energetics of the libido, the intrapsychic conflict\nthat is intrinsic to human being, and the idea of responsibility for\nthe dissonances of desire and the skirmishes that shape a life and its\npatterns. While controversy has swirled around Freud\u2019s rejection\nof the seduction hypothesis, without the scandalous supposition of\ninfantile sexuality there would be no psychoanalytic theory of the\nunconscious. Although some revisionists have argued that Freud\nabandons his principles and betrays his patients, in fact Freud never\nabjures the reality of sexual abuse or denies that some children are\nmolested. Rather, the transformation in his thinking concerns the\naetiology of hysteria in a diagnostic sense; neuroses are no longer\nsaid to originate in (presumably rare) childhood sexual violence, and\nthus they can be seen to pervade rather than oppose whatever might be\nconsidered normal sexual development. In discarding the idea of a\nprimary or ontological innocence of the psyche which is then violently\nimposed upon from the outside, Freud arrives at the fundamental\npremise of psychoanalytic thought.\n\nThe exemplar of this phantasmatic activity of the unconscious is the\nOedipal Complex. In Freud\u2019s later writings on femininity,\nincluding \u201cFemininity\u201d (1933), \u201cFemale\nSexuality\u201d (1931), and \u201cSome Psychical Consequences of the\nAnatomical Distinction between the Sexes\u201d (1925), Freud\npostulates that the little girl\u2019s Oedipal Complex runs a\ndifferent course than the little boy\u2019s and holds a different\nrelation to castration anxiety. Crucially, Freud maintains that\nfemininity cannot be grasped from a biological or conventional\nperspective (Freud 1933 [1968: 114]). Another way of putting this is\nthat sexual difference is centrally concerned with psychical reality\nrather than material reality, with the realm of fantasy rather than\nnature or culture. The Oedipal story is the story of psychic\ndevelopment, the story of how we become subjects and in becoming\nsubjects, how we become sexually differentiated.\n\nThe boy and the girl start off, pre-Oedipally, in the same emotional\nplace, attached to the mother, and it is because of this shared\nstarting point that Freud claims the little girl is a little man; they\nare not yet distinct or sexually differentiated. It is for this reason\nas well that Freud maintains the idea of a single, masculine, libido:\nthe libido is not neutral in Freud\u2019s view since its original\nobject is the mother and this desire for the mother is associated by\nFreud with masculinity and activity, just as he associates infant\nclitoral pleasure with phallic enjoyment. Still Freud acknowledges\nthat in the libido\u2019s most primordial stages, there can be no\nsexual distinction. It is not until children pass through the Oedipal\nComplex that they can properly be said to have a genital organization\nsince this is acquired through a relation to castration and is the\nlast stage in sexual development (following oral, anal, and phallic\nstages). Hence both children at infancy are \u2018little men,\u2019\ntheir desire construed through the terms of a single masculine\nlibido. \n\nFreud seems genuinely puzzled by how femininity comes\nabout given the girl\u2019s prehistory of love\nand attachment to the mother, why would she switch allegiances to the\nfather? And since, prior to genital organization, she too goes through\na phallic (masturbatory) stage, why would she switch the site of\nbodily pleasure from the clitoris to the vagina? These are among the\nmysteries he means to designate when referring to the riddle of\nfemininity. That he understands it to be a riddle also intimates that\nhe understands sexual identity not as a natural pre-given essence,\nrooted in anatomy, but rather as a form of individuation and\ndifferentiation realized through complex interaction between the\nbodily drives and familial others. The boy\u2019s story is more\nseamless and continuous since he retains his phallic pleasure and,\nalthough he must displace the immediate object of his desire (no\nlonger the mother, but someone like her), can look forward to\nsubstitute objects. The boy\u2019s Oedipal attachment to the mother\nfollows uninterruptedly from a pre-Oedipal attachment and it is\nbrought to an end by the threat of castration emanating from the\nfather. At the conclusion of the Oedipal Complex the boy identifies\nwith the father, establishes a super-ego within, and abandons the\nimmediate object of desire with the promise that he too will one day\npossess a similar object modeled on the mother. But the girl\u2019s\nOedipal Complex is necessarily more complicated since it can only be\ninstigated by a break from the pre-Oedipal relation to the mother and\nis therefore a secondary formation. Freud postulates that it is the\nrealization that the beloved mother is castrated that prompts the\nlittle girl to turn her love toward her father. For the girl, in other\nwords, castration does not resolve the Oedipal Complex but leads her\nto enter it, and for this reason Freud claims that it is never wholly\nbrought to a conclusion or demolished, thus accounting, in his view,\nfor girls\u2019 weaker super-egos and lesser capacity for\nsublimation. The girl turns from her mother not in fear but in\ncontempt and because of envy for what the mother does not possess. The\nfather represents for her neither a threat (she finds herself already\ncastrated) nor the prospect of a fulfilled desire in the future (the\nonly replacement for the missing penis is a child of her own), as he\ndoes for the boy who can identify with him and hope to eventually have\nwhat he has. The father\u2019s only promise is thus as a refuge from\nloss, represented by the mother who bears this loss and who is at\nfault for the girl\u2019s own. In the girl\u2019s Oedipal scenario,\nthe father, unlike the castrated mother, stands for the virile\ncapacity of desire itself, which she herself lacks but might reclaim\nthrough another man\u2019s provision of the opportunity to have a\nchild. In the trajectory of the girl\u2019s Oedipal Complex,\nfemininity is realized as the desire to be the object of masculine\ndesire.\n\nFreud\u2019s theories of sexuality and the unconscious implicate not\nonly individual psychology but also the constitution of social life.\nFormed in ambivalent relation to others, sexuality and sexual identity\npermeate the bonds of civilization and ramify throughout all social\nrelations. In turning his attention to broader cultural questions,\nFreud offers a story or myth of the origin of political structures\nthat parallels and echoes his understanding of the individual psyche.\nTo understand the political import of the Oedipal Complex, it will be\nhelpful to place it more generally within the scope of Freud\u2019s\nunderstanding of group psychology. In Group Psychology and the\nAnalysis of the Ego (1921), Freud contests\nany clear-cut opposition between group and individual psychology and\nalleges that human infancy is from the beginning immersed in a world\nof others. Even in ostensibly individual psychology, there is always\nanother involved, as model or object, as site of identification or as\nobject of love. Identification and love, which form the core of\nidentity, are already \u201csocial phenomena\u201d and, inversely\nsocial relations are themselves premised on developments that occur in\nthe family. It is thus mistaken to sever individual from group\npsychology as though they were not by nature intermingled or to\nsuppose that there is some kind of special social instinct separate\nfrom the drives that energize the individual. Put another way, the\nindividual subject is neither formed wholly independently in a kind of\nsolitary interiority nor formed as merely an effect of exterior social\nforces.\n\nTotem and Taboo (1913) is Freud\u2019s attempt to\nexplain the origin of social life, the bonds that, on his account,\nhold men together, on the basis of psychic phenomena. Freud\nenvisages a primitive pre-political sociality in which a primal horde\nof brothers is oppressed by a powerful father who claims for himself\nall the women, all the enjoyment, available in the community. The\nbrothers are deprived or exiled, and they are motivated to bond\ntogether to overthrow the father; they aim, that is, to kill the\nfather and take for themselves his women, offenses that mirror, at a\ncollective level, the Oedipal desires of male children. In\nFreud\u2019s story, the father\u2019s murder results not in lawless\nfreedom and unlimited access to sexual objects (a fraternal civil\nwar), but rather in the creation of totems and taboos\u2014the primal\nfather becomes a totemic figure, a revered ancestral object, and the\nbrother\u2019s actions in killing him and claiming his women are\nreconceived as the prohibited transgressions of murder and incest. The\ntwo blood taboos that are instituted as law, the prohibitions on\nincest and murder, thus have a common origin and emerge\nsimultaneously, and together they mandate the social processes of\nexogamy (marriage outside one\u2019s own kin) and totemism (communal\nbonds of affiliation established through the medium of a common\nancestor). Freud thereby allies political formation with the two\nprimal wishes of children and the two crimes of Oedipus, predicating\nexogamy on the incest taboo, and fraternal bonds on the sacralization\nof life and the prohibition on murder. Totemism and exogamy also\nentail fraternal equality: in order that no one take the place of the\nfather and assume his singular power, the brothers are equally\nconstrained and equally respected, the distribution of women equally\nallotted. Depicting the creation of a stable society grounded in law\n(though founded in violence), Freud\u2019s tale serves as a paradigm\nfor not only rudimentary, but also enduring and contemporary,\npolitical relations, which he views as rooted in unconscious drives\nbut oriented toward achieving a stabilization or equilibrium of those\ndrives at the communal level. In Freud\u2019s narrative, it is the\nfather/son relationship that matters for the establishment of this\nsemi-stable political relation, a band of brothers with equal rights.\nThis lineage founds political order in murderous fraternity, with\nwomen as objects of exchange not citizen-subjects.\n\nMoreover, in explaining the advent of lawful existence, Freud\nidentifies something recalcitrant, intractable in social\narrangements\u2014a kind of self-assault (the super-ego) that links\npleasure with aggression, and thus that carries a potentially\ndestabilizing force. The sons\u2019 attitude toward the father is one\nof ambivalence, hatred qualified by admiration, murder followed by\nguilt and remorse. The brothers commemorate this loss and maintain\ntheir bond with one another in the public ceremony of the totem meal\nwhere together they consume a common substance (the father\u2019s\nbody transubstantiated into the sacrificed totem), and thereby affirm\ntheir fellowship and mutual obligation. This confirmation of shared\npaternal substance and kinship, and the collective affect of love,\nloss, guilt, and mourning, maintains ties of identity. The law that\nemerges from the father\u2019s murder ritualizes and enforces his\nedicts, forbidding murder and incest in the public realm, and takes\nhold internally in the superegoic \u2019no\u2019 of prohibition,\nproducing a permanent sense of guilt that drives civilization and\nrenders it a perpetual source of discontent. Women, however, appear\nnot as subjects of the law but as objects of its exchange; moreover,\ngiven the indefinite prolongation of their Oedipal Complex, women will\nbe more likely to be hostile to the edicts of civilization insofar as\nthese infringe upon family life.\n\nThe relation between father and son is also contained, if concealed,\nin the account Freud offers in The Ego and the Id (1923) of\nhow the ego emerges. There Freud writes that identification is\n\u201cthe earliest expression of an emotional tie with another\nperson\u201d (Freud 1923 [1968: 37]), i.e., it is prior to\nobject-cathexes or relations of desire. The primordial libidinal, but\nnon-objectal, attachment is with the father of \u201cpersonal\nprehistory\u201d (Freud 1923 [1968: 37]). The subsequent and\nrecurring retreat from object-cathexis (investment of instinctual\nenergy in an object) to identification (withdrawal of that energy into\nthe self), is the primary mechanism of ego-formation, taking the lost\nobject into oneself. Since the ego is the \u201cprecipitate\u201d of\nabandoned objects, it is configured through loss, in a melancholy\nreabsorption that incorporates via identification objects from which\nthe ego would otherwise be exiled. Just as the father retains\ndominance in political life after his death, so he dominates psychic\nlife even prior to the ego\u2019s formation. In Freudian theory, the\nfather\u2019s reign is pervasive, his sovereignty extended in every\ndomain. Freud\u2019s privileging of paternal and fraternal\nrelations provides the impetus for much of psychoanalytic\nfeminism, as will be discussed below.\n",
