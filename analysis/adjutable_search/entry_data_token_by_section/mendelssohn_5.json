    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n6. Aesthetics\n\nMendelssohn makes singular contributions to the development of the\nnewly developing discipline of aesthetics in 18th century Germany (for\noverviews of German aesthetics and Mendelssohn\u2019s place in it at\nthe time, see Beiser 2009, Pollok 2010, Madonna 2011, and Guyer 2014).\nIn On the Main Principles of the Fine Arts and Sciences,\nMendelssohn sets out from the assumption that the human spirit has\nlearned to imitate beauty, \u201cthe self-empowered mistress of all\nour sentiments,\u201d in works of art. He then proceeds to ask what\nthe arts have in common or, in other words, what beauty is.\nBatteux\u2019s thesis that art consists in the imitation of nature\nmerely defers the question or, better, requires its revision to the\neffect that we ask what the beauties of nature and of art have in\ncommon. After rejecting Hutcheson\u2019s appeal to an aesthetic sense\nas a deus ex machina that forecloses inquiry, Mendelssohn contends\nthat the common feature is a sensuously perfect representation (a\ncontention that can be traced back to Sulzer and Baumgarten).\n\u201cSensuous\u201d in this connection stands not simply for the\nfact that an object is sensed by the external senses, but also for the\nfact that an entire array of an object\u2019s features is perceived\nall at once. Unlike the distinct representation of a triangle whereby\nthe intellect distinguishes parts and aspects of the triangle from one\nanother, a sensuous representation is clear but indistinct, that is to\nsay, to have a sensuous representation is to perceive something\nwithout intellectually distinguishing its parts or aspects. But we can\nsensuously perceive an order or harmony to those aspects without\nintellectually distinguishing them. Beauty or the perfect sensuous\nrepresentation \u2014 whether in nature or in art \u2014 accordingly\npertains to forms, orders, harmonies, and \u201cindeed, everything\ncapable of being represented to the senses as a perfection\u201d\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 172). On this definition of art,\nwhat is represented can be ugly or repugnant as long as the\nrepresentation is sensuously perfect (though Mendelssohn does address,\nas discussed below, the mixed sentiment that accrues when the object\nrepresented is unpleasant). From these considerations, Mendelssohn\nderives two necessary conditions of fine art and letters: faithfulness\nof the representation (\u201cimitation\u201d) and, far more\nimportantly, the artistry, even \u201cgenius,\u201d involved. In\nthis connection, he argues that, as far as individual beauties in\nnature are concerned, they are inferior to the beauties produced by\narts. In On the Main Principles Mendelssohn also establishes\nthe general distinction between fine arts and fine science along the\nlines of the difference between natural and artificial signs. Whereas\nthe \u201cfine arts\u201d (beaux arts) \u2014 music,\ndance, painting, sculpture, and architecture \u2014 predominantly\nwork with natural signs, the \u201cfine sciences\u201d (belles\nlettres) \u2014 poetry and rhetoric \u2014 typically employ\nartificial signs. The distinction is hardly ironclad, however, and\nMendelssohn ends On the Main Principles with a discussion of\nways the arts may borrow from one another (e.g., allegorical painting)\nor combine (e.g., opera).\n\nAt one point in the dialogue On Sentiments\n(Mendelssohn\u2019s second publication but first publication on\naesthetic matters), one of the protagonists differentiates three sorts\nof pleasure: sensuous, beautiful, and intellectual (a differentiation\nwhich approximates respectively the three sorts of perceptions\nelaborated by Leibniz and Wolff, among others, namely, confused,\nclear, and distinct). In this context, Mendelssohn explains how beauty\naffords a distinctive pleasure precisely as the unity of the\nmultiplicity of things taken in by the senses (a view subsequently\niterated, as we have seen, in On the Main Principles).\nUnaddressed by this differentiation of pleasures, however, are the\nso-called \u201cmixed sentiments\u201d that we seem to experience\nsometimes in viewing what is otherwise painful, terrifying, or, at any\nrate, does not exhibit the harmony or order typical of beauty. At\nfirst (namely, in On Sentiments) Mendelssohn thought that the\nproblem could still be handled by identifying some perfection in the\nobject \u2014 e.g., the skillfulness of the gladiator, the virtue of\nthe tragic figure \u2014 as the source of the pleasure that we feel.\nSix years later, in Rhapsody or additions to the Letter on\nsentiments, he revises his explanation of these mixed sentiments\nby noting that each individual representation has a subjective and an\nobjective component (for a valuable account of Mendelssohn\u2019s\ndeveloping conception of mixed sentiments, see Pollok 2018a).\nSubjectively or \u201cas a determination of the soul,\u201d the\nrepresentation can affirm some perfection in the soul and thus be\npleasing, even though objectively or \u201cas a picture of the\nobject,\u201d we might find it repugnant. Tragedy is more complicated\nsince the sympathy that we feel for the tragic figure is based upon\nboth objective and subjective perfections (i.e., in him or her and us)\nas well as upon objective imperfection, the pain and injustice that\nbefall him or her.\n\nMendelssohn gives another twist to his interpretation of \u201cmixed\nsentiments\u201d in the Rhapsody and then later in \u201cOn\nthe Sublime and the Na\u00efve in the Fine Sciences.\u201d\nExperiences of the sheer immensities of things \u2014 \u201cthe\nunfathomable world of the sea, a far-reaching plain, the innumerable\nlegions of stars, the eternity of time, every height and depth that\nexhausts us\u201d (Philosophical Writings, p. 144) \u2014\nsometimes make us tremble, but we still find them alluring. It is\ngratifying to experience them, though they confirm an imperfection as\nwell as a perfection in us. In \u201cOn the Sublime,\u201d\nMendelssohn further distinguishes beauty as something bounded from\nimmensity as something unbounded. He then distinguishes extended from\nnon-extended (intensive) immensity. The sea\u2019s unfathomableness\nwould be an example of extended immensity in nature; uniform\nrepetition of temporal intervals in music would be an example of an\nattempt to represent the experience of an extended immensity in art.\nBut Mendelssohn seems to be more interested in the non-extended or\nintensive immensities. \u201cPower, genius, virtue have their\nunextended immensity that likewise arouses a spine-tingling sentiment\nbut has the advantage of not ending, through tedious uniformity, in\nsatiation and even disgust, as generally happens in the case of the\nextended immensity\u201d (Philosophical Writings, p. 194).\nMendelssohn then introduces the category of sublimity for the perfect\nrepresentation of such intensive immensity, a representation that\nproduces awe precisely because it passes beyond our customary\nexpectations. For an insightful treatment of Mendelssohn\u2019s view\nof mixed sentiments as \u201ca complex account of the multiple\nsources of aesthetic responses to art,\u201d see Guyer 2011.\n\nThere is one last aspect of Mendelssohn\u2019s aesthetics that\ndeserves mention, not least for its bearing on subsequent developments\nin aesthetics. It has already been noted that the pleasures of beauty\nand sublimity are not to be identified as purely sensuous or purely\nintellectual pleasures. In keeping with this differentiation,\nMendelssohn differentiates the sort of approval involved in aesthetic\nexperiences from knowledge or desire, though he insists that aesthetic\nfeelings of pleasure can, nonetheless, serve \u201cas the transition\n(Uebergang) as it were from knowing to desiring\u201d\n(Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 61f; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 169, 307\u2013310). In his adoption of three\ndistinct capacities of the mind and in his appraisal of the aesthetic\ndimension as providing a bridge between matters of truth and falsity\n(capacities of knowing) and matters of good and evil (capacities of\ndesiring), Mendelssohn plainly anticipates central aspects of\nKant\u2019s mature, critical philosophy. A further, though less\nprecise similarity also deserves mention, namely, the likeness between\nKant\u2019s conception of the disinterested character of experience\nof the beautiful and Mendelssohn\u2019s conception of the experience\nas something affording us a pleasure that is neither simply sensuous\nor intellectual. \u201cWe consider the beauty of nature and art with\npleasure and satisfaction, without the slightest movement of desire.\nInstead, it appears to be a particular mark of beauty that it is\nconsidered with tranquil satisfaction; that it pleases if we also do\nnot possess it and we are still far removed from demanding to possess\nit\u201d (Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 61;\nPhilosophical Writings, pp. 34\u201351). For a more detailed\nreview of the robust affinities of Kant\u2019s aesthetics with\nMendelssohn\u2019s (despite Kant\u2019s rejection of perfectionism\nin aesthetics) together with a discussion of certain advantages of\nMendelssohn\u2019s aesthetics in contrast to Kant\u2019s, see Guyer\n2018b. More recently, while indicating how, prima facie appearances to\nthe contrary notwithstanding, \u201cKant\u2019s core aesthetic\nexperience seems deeply Mendelssohnian,\u201d Guyer nonetheless\nidentifies significant differences between their aesthetics. These\ndifferences include Mendelssohn\u2019s appreciation of the broader\nrange of properties \u2013 not least sensory qualities \u00ad\u2013\nthat enter into aesthetic experience and his recognition of \u201cthe\ncentrality of the expression of emotion in the experience of\nart.\u201d Guyer suggests two reasons for these differences:\nMendelssohn\u2019s lack of concern for the question of the universal\nvalidity of aesthetic judgment (presumably imperiled in Kant\u2019s\nview by introducing a role for sentiment) and the central role that\nMendelssohn assigns to emotion in moral motivation; see Guyer 2020,\n245\u2013255.\n",
