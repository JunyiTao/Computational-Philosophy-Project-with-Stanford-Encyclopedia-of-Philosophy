Hedonistic vs. Pluralistic Consequentialisms\n\nSome moral theorists seek a single simple basic principle because they\nassume that simplicity is needed in order to decide what is right when\nless basic principles or reasons conflict. This assumption seems to\nmake hedonism attractive. Unfortunately, however, hedonism is not as\nsimple as they assume, because hedonists count both pleasures and\npains. Pleasure is distinct from the absence of pain, and pain is\ndistinct from the absence of pleasure, since sometimes people feel\nneither pleasure nor pain, and sometimes they feel both at once.\nNonetheless, hedonism was adopted partly because it seemed simpler\nthan competing views.\n\nThe simplicity of hedonism was also a source of opposition. From the\nstart, the hedonism in classic utilitarianism was treated with\ncontempt. Some contemporaries of Bentham and Mill argued that hedonism\nlowers the value of human life to the level of animals, because it\nimplies that, as Bentham said, an unsophisticated game (such as\npush-pin) is as good as highly intellectual poetry if the game creates\nas much pleasure (Bentham 1843). Quantitative hedonists\nsometimes respond that great poetry almost always creates more\npleasure than trivial games (or sex and drugs and rock-and-roll),\nbecause the pleasures of poetry are more certain (or probable),\ndurable (or lasting), fecund (likely to lead to other pleasures), pure\n(unlikely to lead to pains), and so on.\n\nMill used a different strategy to avoid calling push-pin as good as\npoetry. He distinguished higher and lower qualities of pleasures\naccording to the preferences of people who have experienced both kinds\n(Mill 1861, 56; compare Plato 1993 and Hutcheson 1755, 421\u201323).\nThis qualitative hedonism has been subjected to much\ncriticism, including charges that it is incoherent and does not count\nas hedonism (Moore 1903, 80\u201381; cf. Feldman 1997,\n106\u201324).\n\nEven if qualitative hedonism is coherent and is a kind of hedonism, it\nstill might not seem plausible. Some critics argue that not\nall pleasures are valuable, since, for example, there is no\nvalue in the pleasures that a sadist gets from whipping a victim or\nthat an addict gets from drugs. Other opponents object that not\nonly pleasures are intrinsically valuable, because other\nthings are valuable independently of whether they lead to pleasure or\navoid pain. For example, my love for my wife does not seem to become\nless valuable when I get less pleasure from her because she contracts\nsome horrible disease. Similarly, freedom seems valuable even when it\ncreates anxiety, and even when it is freedom to do something (such as\nleave one\u2019s country) that one does not want to do. Again, many\npeople value knowledge of distant galaxies regardless of whether this\nknowledge will create pleasure or avoid pain.\n\nThese points against hedonism are often supplemented with the story of\nthe experience machine found in Nozick 1974 (42\u201345; cf. De\nBrigard 2010) and the movie, The Matrix. People on this\nmachine believe they are spending time with their friends,\nwinning Olympic gold medals and Nobel prizes, having sex with their\nfavorite lovers, or doing whatever gives them the greatest balance of\npleasure over pain. Although they have no real friends or lovers and\nactually accomplish nothing, people on the experience machine get just\nas much pleasure as if their beliefs were true. Moreover, they feel no\n(or little) pain. Assuming that the machine is reliable, it would seem\nirrational not to hook oneself up to this machine if pleasure\nand pain were all that mattered, as hedonists claim. Since it does\nnot seem irrational to refuse to hook oneself up to this\nmachine, hedonism seems inadequate. The reason is that hedonism\noverlooks the value of real friendship, knowledge, freedom,\nand achievements, all of which are lacking for deluded people on the\nexperience machine.\n\nSome hedonists claim that this objection rests on a misinterpretation\nof hedonism. If hedonists see pleasure and pain as\nsensations, then a machine might be able to reproduce those\nsensations. However, we can also say that a mother is pleased that her\ndaughter gets good grades. Such propositional pleasure occurs\nonly when the state of affairs in which the person takes pleasure\nexists (that is, when the daughter actually gets good grades). But the\nrelevant states of affairs would not really exist if one were hooked\nup to the experience machine. Hence, hedonists who value propositional\npleasure rather than or in addition to sensational pleasure can deny\nthat more pleasure is achieved by hooking oneself up to such an\nexperience machine (Feldman 1997, 79\u2013105; see also\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1998 and Feldman 2004 for more on hedonism).\n\nA related position rests on the claim that what is good is desire\nsatisfaction or the fulfillment of preferences; and what is bad is the\nfrustration of desires or preferences. What is desired or preferred is\nusually not a sensation but is, rather, a state of affairs, such as\nhaving a friend or accomplishing a goal. If a person desires or\nprefers to have true friends and true accomplishments and not to be\ndeluded, then hooking this person up to the experience machine need\nnot maximize desire satisfaction. Utilitarians who adopt this theory\nof value can then claim that an agent morally ought to do an act if\nand only if that act maximizes desire satisfaction or preference\nfulfillment (that is, the degree to which the act achieves whatever is\ndesired or preferred). What maximizes desire satisfaction or\npreference fulfillment need not maximize sensations of pleasure when\nwhat is desired or preferred is not a sensation of pleasure. This\nposition is usually described as preference\nutilitarianism.\n\nOne problem for preference utilitarianism concerns how to make\ninterpersonal comparisons (though this problem also arises for several\nother theories of value). If we want to know what one person prefers,\nwe can ask what that person would choose in conflicts. We cannot,\nhowever, use the same method to determine whether one person\u2019s\npreference is stronger or weaker than another person\u2019s\npreference, since these different people might choose differently in\nthe decisive conflicts. We need to settle which preference (or\npleasure) is stronger because we may know that Jones prefers A\u2019s\nbeing done to A\u2019s not being done (and Jones would receive more\npleasure from A\u2019s being done than from A\u2019s not being\ndone), whereas Smith prefers A\u2019s not being done (and Smith would\nreceive more pleasure from A\u2019s not being done than from\nA\u2019s being done). To determine whether it is right to do A or not\nto do A, we must be able to compare the strengths of Jones\u2019s and\nSmith\u2019s preferences (or the amounts of pleasure each would\nreceive in her preferred outcome) in order to determine whether doing\nA or not doing A would be better overall. Utilitarians and\nconsequentialists have proposed many ways to solve this problem of\ninterpersonal comparison, and each attempt has received criticisms.\nDebates about this problem still rage. (For a recent discussion with\nreferences, see Coakley 2015.)\n\nPreference utilitarianism is also often criticized on the grounds that\nsome preferences are misinformed, crazy, horrendous, or trivial. I\nmight prefer to drink the liquid in a glass because I think that it is\nbeer, though it really is strong acid. Or I might prefer to die merely\nbecause I am clinically depressed. Or I might prefer to torture\nchildren. Or I might prefer to spend my life learning to write as\nsmall as possible. In all such cases, opponents of preference\nutilitarianism can deny that what I prefer is really good. Preference\nutilitarians can respond by limiting the preferences that make\nsomething good, such as by referring to informed desires that do not\ndisappear after therapy (Brandt 1979). However, it is not clear that\nsuch qualifications can solve all of the problems for a preference\ntheory of value without making the theory circular by depending on\nsubstantive assumptions about which preferences are for good\nthings.\n\nMany consequentialists deny that all values can be reduced to any\nsingle ground, such as pleasure or desire satisfaction, so they\ninstead adopt a pluralistic theory of value. Moore\u2019s ideal\nutilitarianism, for example, takes into account the values of\nbeauty and truth (or knowledge) in addition to pleasure (Moore 1903,\n83\u201385, 194; 1912). Other consequentialists add the intrinsic\nvalues of friendship or love, freedom or ability, justice or fairness,\ndesert, life, virtue, and so on.\n\nIf the recognized values all concern individual welfare, then the\ntheory of value can be called welfarist (Sen 1979). When a\nwelfarist theory of value is combined with the other elements of\nclassic utilitarianism, the resulting theory can be called\nwelfarist consequentialism.\n\nOne non-welfarist theory of value is perfectionism, which\nclaims that certain states make a person\u2019s life good without\nnecessarily being good for the person in any way that increases that\nperson\u2019s welfare (Hurka 1993, esp. 17). If this theory of value\nis combined with other elements of classic utilitarianism, the\nresulting theory can be called perfectionist consequentialism\nor, in deference to its Aristotelian roots, eudaemonistic\nconsequentialism.\n\nSimilarly, some consequentialists hold that an act is right if and\nonly if it maximizes some function of both happiness and capabilities\n(Sen 1985, Nussbaum 2000). Disabilities are then seen as bad\nregardless of whether they are accompanied by pain or loss of\npleasure.\n\nOr one could hold that an act is right if it maximizes fulfillment (or\nminimizes violation) of certain specified moral rights. Such theories\nare sometimes described as a utilitarianism of rights. This\napproach could be built into total consequentialism with rights\nweighed against happiness and other values or, alternatively, the\ndisvalue of rights violations could be lexically ranked prior to any\nother kind of loss or harm (cf. Rawls 1971, 42). Such a lexical\nranking within a consequentialist moral theory would yield the result\nthat nobody is ever justified in violating rights for the sake of\nhappiness or any value other than rights, although it would still\nallow some rights violations in order to avoid or prevent other rights\nviolations.\n\nWhen consequentialists incorporate a variety of values, they need to\nrank or weigh each value against the others. This is often difficult.\nSome consequentialists even hold that certain values are\nincommensurable or incomparable in that no comparison of their values\nis possible (Griffin 1986 and Chang 1997). This position allows\nconsequentialists to recognize the possibility of irresolvable moral\ndilemmas (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, 81; Railton 2003, 249\u201391).\n\nPluralism about values also enables consequentialists to handle many\nof the problems that plague hedonistic utilitarianism. For example,\nopponents often charge that classical utilitarians cannot explain our\nobligations to keep promises and not to lie when no pain is caused or\npleasure is lost. Whether or not hedonists can meet this challenge,\npluralists can hold that knowledge is intrinsically good and/or that\nfalse belief is intrinsically bad. Then, if deception causes false\nbeliefs, deception is instrumentally bad, and agents ought not to lie\nwithout a good reason, even when lying causes no pain or loss of\npleasure. Since lying is an attempt to deceive, to lie is to attempt\nto do what is morally wrong (in the absence of defeating factors).\nSimilarly, if a promise to do an act is an attempt to make an audience\nbelieve that the promiser will do the act, then to break a promise is\nfor a promiser to make false a belief that the promiser created or\ntried to create. Although there is more tale to tell, the disvalue of\nfalse belief can be part of a consequentialist story about why it is\nmorally wrong to break promises.\n\nWhen such pluralist versions of consequentialism are not welfarist,\nsome philosophers would not call them utilitarian. However,\nthis usage is not uniform, since even non-welfarist views are\nsometimes called utilitarian. Whatever you call them, the important\npoint is that consequentialism and the other elements of classical\nutilitarianism are compatible with many different theories about which\nthings are good or valuable.\n\nInstead of turning pluralist, some consequentialists foreswear the\naggregation of values. Classic utilitarianism added up the values\nwithin each part of the consequences to determine which total set of\nconsequences has the most value in it. One could, instead, aggregate\ngoods for each individual but not aggregate goods of separate\nindividuals (Roberts 2002). Alternatively, one could give up all\naggregation, including aggregation for individuals, and instead rank\nthe complete worlds or sets\u00a0of consequences\u00a0caused\u00a0by\nacts without adding up the values of the parts of those worlds or\nconsequences. One motive for this move is Moore\u2019s principle of\norganic unity (Moore 1903, 27\u201336), which claims that the value\nof a combination or \u201corganic unity\u201d of two or more things\ncannot be calculated simply by adding the values of the things that\nare combined or unified. For example, even if punishment of a criminal\ncauses pain, a consequentialist can hold that a world with both the\ncrime and the punishment is better than a world with the crime but not\nthe punishment, perhaps because the former contains more justice,\nwithout adding the value of this justice to\u00a0the negative value of\nthe pain of\u00a0the punishment. Similarly, a world might seem better\nwhen people do not get pleasures that they do not deserve, even if\nthis judgment is not reached by adding the values of these pleasures\nto other values to calculate any total. Cases like these lead some\nconsequentialists to deny that moral rightness is any aggregative\nfunction of the values of particular effects of acts. Instead, they\ncompare the whole world\u00a0that results from an action with the\nwhole world that results from not doing that action. If the former is\nbetter, then the action is morally right (J.J.C. Smart 1973, 32;\nFeldman 1997, 17\u201335). This approach can be called holistic\nconsequentialism or world utilitarianism.\n\nAnother way to incorporate relations among values is to consider\ndistribution. Compare one outcome where most people are\ndestitute but a few lucky people have extremely large amounts of goods\nwith another outcome that contains slightly less total goods but where\nevery person has nearly the same amount of goods. Egalitarian critics\nof classical utilitarianism argue that the latter outcome is better,\nso more than the total amount of good matters. Traditional hedonistic\nutilitarians who prefer the latter outcome often try to justify\negalitarian distributions of goods by appealing to a principle of\ndiminishing marginal utility. Other consequentialists, however,\nincorporate a more robust commitment to equality. Early on, Sidgwick\n(1907, 417) responded to such objections by allowing distribution to\nbreak ties between other values. More recently, some consequentialists\nhave added some notion of fairness (Broome 1991, 192\u2013200) or\ndesert (Feldman 1997, 154\u201374) to their test of which outcome is\nbest. (See also Kagan 1998, 48\u201359.) Others turn to\nprioritarianism, which puts more weight on people who are worse off\n(Adler and Norheim 2022, Arneson 2022). Such consequentialists do not\nsimply add up values; they look at patterns.\n\nA related issue arises from population change. Imagine that a\ngovernment considers whether to provide free contraceptives to curb a\nrise in population. Without free contraceptives, overcrowding will\nbring hunger, disease, and pain, so each person will be worse off.\nStill, each new person will have enough pleasure and other goods that\nthe total net utility will increase with the population. Classic\nutilitarianism focuses on total utility, so it seems to imply that\nthis government should not provide free contraceptives. That seems\nimplausible to many utilitarians. To avoid this result, some\nutilitarians claim that an act is morally wrong if and only if its\nconsequences contain more pain (or other disvalues) than an\nalternative, regardless of positive values (cf. R. N. Smart 1958).\nThis negative utilitarianism implies that the government\nshould provide contraceptives, since that program reduces pain (and\nother disvalues), even though it also decreases total net pleasure (or\ngood). Unfortunately, negative utilitarianism also seems to imply that\nthe government should painlessly kill everyone it can, since dead\npeople feel no pain (and have no false beliefs, diseases, or\ndisabilities \u2013 though killing them does cause loss of ability).\nA more popular response is average utilitarianism, which says that the\nbest consequences are those with the highest average utility (cf.\nRawls 1971, 161\u201375). The average utility would be higher with\nthe contraceptive program than without it, so average utilitarianism\nyields the more plausible result\u2014that the government should\nadopt the contraceptive program. Critics sometimes charge that the\naverage utility could also be increased by killing the worst off, but\nthis claim is not at all clear, because such killing would put\neveryone in danger (since, after the worst off are killed, another\ngroup becomes the worst off, and then they might be killed next).\nStill, average utilitarianism faces problems of its own (such as\n\u201cthe mere addition paradox\u201d in Parfit 1984, chap. 19). In\nany case, all maximizing consequentialists, whether or not they are\npluralists, must decide whether moral rightness depends on maximizing\ntotal good or average good.\n\nA final challenge to consequentialists\u2019 accounts of value\nderives from Geach 1956 and has been pressed by Thomson 2001. Thomson\nargues that \u201cA is a good X\u201d (such as a good poison) does\nnot entail \u201cA is good\u201d, so the term \u201cgood\u201d is\nan attributive adjective and cannot legitimately be used without\nqualification. On this view, it is senseless to call something good\nunless this means that it is good for someone or in some respect or\nfor some use or at some activity or as an instance of some kind.\nConsequentialists are supposed to violate this restriction when they\nsay that the total or average consequences or the world as a whole is\ngood without any such qualification. However, consequentialists can\nrespond either that the term \u201cgood\u201d has predicative uses\nin addition to its attributive uses or that when they call a world or\ntotal set of consequences good, they are calling it good for\nconsequences or for a world (Sinnott-Armstrong 2003a). If so, the fact\nthat \u201cgood\u201d is often used attributively creates no problem\nfor consequentialists.\n",
