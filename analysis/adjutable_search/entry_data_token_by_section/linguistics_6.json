    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories || Competence and performance\n2.1 Competence and performance\n\nEssentialists invariably distinguish between what Chomsky (1965)\ncalled competence and performance.\nCompetence is what knowing a language confers: a tacit grasp of the\nstructural properties of all the sentences of a language. Performance\ninvolves actual real-time use, and may diverge radically from the\nunderlying competence, for at least two reasons: (a) an attempt to\nproduce an utterance may be perturbed by non-linguistic factors like\nbeing distracted or interrupted, changing plans or losing attention,\nbeing drunk or having a brain injury; or (b) certain capacity limits\nof the mechanisms of perception or production may be overstepped.\n\nEmergentists tend to feel that the competence/performance distinction\nsidelines language use too much. Bybee and McClelland put it this\nway:\n\nOne common view is that language has an essential and unique inner\nstructure that conforms to a universal ideal, and what people say is a\npotentially imperfect reflection of this inner essence, muddied by\nperformance factors. According to an opposing view\u2026language use\nhas a major impact on language structure. The experience that users\nhave with language shapes cognitive representations, which are built\nup through the application of general principles of human cognition to\nlinguistic input. The structure that appears to underlie language use\nreflects the operation of these principles as they shape how\nindividual speakers and hearers represent form and meaning and adapt\nthese forms and meanings as they speak. (Bybee and McClelland 2005:\n382)\n\n\nAnd Externalists are often concerned to describe and explain not only\nlanguage structure, but also the workings of processing mechanisms and\nthe etiology of performance errors.\n\nHowever, every linguist accepts that some idealization away from the\nspeech phenomena is necessary. Emergentists and Externalists are\nalmost always happy to idealize away from sporadic speech errors. What\nthey are not so keen to do is to idealize away from limitations on\nlinguistic processing and the short-term memory on which it relies.\nAcceptance of a thoroughgoing competence/performance distinction thus\ntends to be a hallmark of Essentialist approaches, which take the\nnature of language to be entirely independent of other human cognitive\nprocesses (though of course capable of connecting to them).\n\nThe Essentialists\u2019 practice of idealizing away from even\npsycholinguistically relevant factors like limits on memory and\nprocessing plays a significant role in various important debates\nwithin linguistics. Perhaps the most salient and famous is the issue\nof whether English is a finite-state language.\n\nThe claim that English is not accepted by any finite-state automaton\ncan only be supported by showing that every grammar for English has\ncenter- embedding to an unbounded depth (see Levelt 2008: 20\u201323\nfor an exposition and proof of the relevant theorem, originally from\nChomsky 1959). But even depth-3 center-embedding of clauses (a clause\ninterrupting a clause that itself interrupts a clause) is in practice\nextraordinarily hard to process. Hardly anyone can readily understand\neven semantically plausible sentences like Vehicles that engineers\nwho car companies trust build crash every day. And such sentences\nvirtually never occur, even in writing. Karlsson (2007) undertakes an\nextensive examination of available textual material, and concludes\nthat depth-3 center-embeddings are vanishingly rare, and no genuine\ndepth-4 center-embedding has ever occurred at all in naturally\ncomposed text. He proposes that there is no reason to regard\ncenter-embedding as grammatical beyond depth 3 (and for spoken\nlanguage, depth 2). Karlsson is proposing a grammar that stays close\nto what performance data can confirm; the standard Essentialist view\nis that we should project massively from what is observed, and say\nthat depth-n center-embedding is fully grammatical for all\nn.\n",
