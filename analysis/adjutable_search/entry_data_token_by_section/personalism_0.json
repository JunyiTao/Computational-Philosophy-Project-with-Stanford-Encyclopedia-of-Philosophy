What is personalism?\n\n\nPersonalism exists in many different versions, and this makes it\nsomewhat difficult to define as a philosophical and theological\nmovement. Many philosophical schools have at their core one particular\nthinker or even one central work which serves as a canonical\ntouchstone. Personalism is a more diffused and eclectic movement and\nhas no such common reference point. It is, in point of fact, more\nproper to speak of many\npersonalisms than one personalism. In 1947 Jacques Maritain\ncould write that there are at least \u201ca dozen personalist\ndoctrines, which at times have nothing more in common than the word\n\u2018person.\u2019\u201d Moreover, because of their emphasis on\nthe subjectivity of the person, some of the more important exponents\nof personalism have not undertaken systematic treatises of their\ntheories.\n\n\nIt is perhaps more proper to speak of personalism as a\n\u201ccurrent\u201d or a broader \u201cworldview\u201d, since it\nrepresents more than one school or one doctrine while at the same time\nthe most important forms of personalism do display some central and\nessential commonalities. Most important of the latter is the general\naffirmation of the centrality of the person for philosophical\nthought. Personalism posits ultimate reality and value in personhood\n\u2013 human as well as (at least for most personalists) divine. It\nemphasizes the significance, uniqueness and inviolability of the\nperson, as well as the person\u2019s essentially relational or\nsocial dimension. The title \u201cpersonalism\u201d can\ntherefore legitimately be applied to any school of thought that\nfocuses on the centrality of persons and their unique status among beings\nin general, and personalists normally acknowledge the indirect\ncontributions of a wide range of thinkers throughout the history of\nphilosophy who did not regard themselves as personalists. Personalists\nbelieve that the person should be the ontological and\nepistemological starting point of philosophical reflection. Many are\nconcerned to investigate the experience, the status, and the dignity\nof the human being as person, and regard this as the starting-point\nfor all subsequent philosophical analysis.\n\n\nPersonalists regard personhood (or \u201cpersonality\u201d) as the\nfundamental notion, as that which gives meaning to all of reality and\nconstitutes its supreme value. Personhood carries with it an\ninviolable dignity that merits unconditional respect. Personalism has\nfor the most part not been primarily a theoretical philosophy of the\nperson. Although it does defend a unique theoretical understanding of\nthe person, this understanding is in itself such as to support the\nprioritization of practical or moral philosophy, while at the same\ntime the moral experience of the person is such as to decisively\ndetermine the theoretical understanding. For personalists, a person\ncombines subjectivity and objectivity, causal activity and\nreceptivity, unicity and relation, identity and creativity. Stressing\nthe moral nature of the person, or the person as the subject and\nobject of free activity, personalism tends to focus on practical,\nmoral action and ethical questions.\n\n\nSome personalists are idealists, believing that reality and its sense\nis constituted by consciousness, while others espouse philosophical\nrealism and argue that the natural order is independent of human\nconsciousness. For taxonomic convenience, the many strains of\npersonalism can be grouped into two fundamental categories:\npersonalism in a strict sense and personalism in a broader\nsense. Strict personalism places the person at the center of a\nphilosophical system that originates from an \u201cintuition\u201d\nof the person himself, and then goes on to analyse the personal\nreality and the personal experience that are the objects of this\nintuition. The method of the main twentieth-century European version\nof this strict personalism draws extensively from phenomenology and\nexistentialism, departing from traditional metaphysics and\nconstituting a separate philosophical system. In the idealistic\nversion of personalism, it becomes more obvious, however, that the\ndeeper sources of strict personalism are often to be found in the\nearly critical reception of German idealism and in some aspects of\nmoral sense philosophy. The original intuition is really that of\nself-awareness, by which one grasps not least values and essential\nmeanings through unmediated experience. The knowledge produced by\nreflecting on this experience is nothing more than an explicitation of\nthe original intuition, which in turn generates an awareness of a\nframework for moral action. The intuition of the person as the center\nof values and meaning is not exhausted, however, in phenomenological\nor existential analyses. These analyses often point beyond themselves,\nindicating a constitutive transcendence of the person himself,\nirreducible either to its specific manifestations or to the sum-total\nof those manifestations. Despite their differences, both the American\nschool of Bowne and his first followers and the European personalism\nof Emmanuel Mounier represent personalism in this strict sense.\n\n\nPersonalism in the broader sense does not consider the person as the\nobject of an original intuition, nor does it conceive of philosophical\nresearch as beginning with an analysis of immediate personal\nexperience and its context.  Rather, in the scope of a general\nmetaphysics the person manifests his singular value and essential\nrole. Thus the person occupies the central place in philosophical\ndiscourse, but this discourse is not reduced to an explicitation or\ndevelopment of an original intuition of the person.  The person does\nnot justify metaphysics but rather metaphysics justifies the person\nand his various operations. Instead of constituting an autonomous\nmetaphysics, personalism in the broader sense offers an\nanthropological-ontological shift in perspective within an existing\nmetaphysics and draws out the ethical consequences of this\nshift. Perhaps the best known strain of personalism in the broad sense\nis so-called \u201cThomistic personalism.\u201d Represented by such\nfigures as Jacques Maritain, Yves Simon, \u00c9tienne Gilson, Robert\nSpaemann, and Karol Wojty\u0142a, Thomistic personalism draws on\nprinciples of Thomas Aquinas\u2019s philosophical and theological\nanthropology in what it sees as a coherent development of inchoate\nelements of Aquinas\u2019s thought.\n\n\nAs a philosophical school, personalism finds its foundations in\nhuman reason and experience, though historically personalism has\nnearly always been united to Biblical theism. Von Balthasar suggests\nthat \u201cWithout the biblical background it [personalism] is\ninconceivable.\u201d Yet while most personalists are theists, belief\nin God is not necessary to all personalist philosophies, and some\nprofess an atheist personalism.\n\n\n Though generally\nconsidered a philosophical school, the personalist approach is often\napplied to other disciplines as well, yielding a plethora of titles\nsuch as theological personalism, economic personalism, ecological\npersonalism and psychological personalism (along with their inversions:\n\u201cpersonalistic theology,\u201d \u201cpersonalistic\neconomics,\u201d \u201cpersonalistic psychology\u201d) and so\nforth.\n",
