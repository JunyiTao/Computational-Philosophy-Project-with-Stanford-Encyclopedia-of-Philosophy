    "main_text": "Conventions of language || Conventional theories of meaning\n7.1 Conventional theories of meaning\n\n\nDavid Lewis (1969) provides the first systematic theory of how social\nconvention generates linguistic meaning. Subsequent philosophers to\noffer convention-based accounts include Jonathan Bennett (1976), Simon\nBlackburn (1984), Wayne Davis (2003), Ernie Lepore and Matthew Stone\n(2015), Brian Loar (1976), and Stephen Schiffer (1972).\n\n\nLewis begins by studying signaling problems. A\ncommunicator has privileged information differentiating among\nstates \\(s_{1},\\ldots, s_{m}\\).\nAudience members can choose among responses\n\\(F(s_{1}), \\ldots, F(s_{m})\\). Everyone prefers that audience\nmembers do \\(F(s_{i})\\) if\n\\(s_{i}\\) obtains. There is a set of signals\n\\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\), \\(m \\le n\\), that the communicator can pass to the audience. In\nLewis\u2019s example, the sexton knows whether the redcoats are staying\nhome, coming by land, or coming by sea. By placing either zero, one,\nor two lanterns in the belfry, he signals Paul Revere whether to go\nhome, warn people that redcoats are coming by land, or warn people\nthat the redcoats are coming by sea. A signaling problem is a\ncoordination problem, because communicator and audience must\ncoordinate so that the communicator\u2019s signal elicits the mutually\ndesired action. Building on Lewis\u2019s discussion, Skyrms (2010) offers\nan intensive analysis of signaling problems, with applications to\ndiverse biological cases studies ranging from bacteria to apes.\n\n\nIn comparison with normal linguistic interaction, signaling problems\nare very specialized. A fundamental difference is that people normally\nneed not agree upon which action(s) would be desirable, given some\nstate of affairs. When we search for an audience reaction canonically\nassociated with an assertion that \\(p\\), the most natural\ncandidate is something like believing that \\(p\\) (or\nperhaps believing that the speaker believes \\(p)\\). Yet coming to\nbelieve a proposition is not an action, and Lewis\u2019s definition of\nconvention presupposes that conventions are regularities of action.\nHence, believing what people say cannot be part of a Lewisian\nconvention.\n\n\nAlthough Lewis explored various ways around this difficulty, he\neventually concluded that we should alter the analysis of convention.\nIn \u201cLanguages and Language\u201d (1975/1983), he broadened the\nanalysis so that regularities of action and belief could serve\nas conventions. Clause (4) of Lewis\u2019s definition entails that\neveryone prefers to conform to the convention given that everyone else\ndoes. Preferences regarding one\u2019s own beliefs are dubiously\nrelevant to ordinary conversation. Thus, in his revised analysis, Lewis\nsubstitutes a new clause:\n\n\nThe expectation of conformity to the convention gives everyone a good\nreason why he himself should conform. (p. 167)\n\n\nThe \u201creason\u201d in question might be either a\npractical reason, in the case of action, or an\nepistemic reason, in the case of belief.\n\n\nLewis defines a language as a function that assigns\ntruth-conditions to sentences. More precisely, and ignoring\ncomplications such as vagueness and indexicality, a language \\(L\\)\nis a mapping that assigns each sentence \\(s\\) a set of possible\nworlds \\(L(s)\\). A sentence \\(s\\) is \u201ctrue in\n\\(L\\)\u201d iff the actual world belongs to\n\\(L(s)\\). There are infinitely many possible languages.\nWe must explain what it is for a given group of agents to use a given\nlanguage. In other words, what is the \u201cactual language\u201d\nrelation? Lewis proposes:\n\n\nA language \\(L\\) is used by a population \\(G\\) iff there\nprevails in \\(G\\) a convention of truthfulness and trust in\n\\(L\\), sustained by an interest in communication,\n\n\nwhere a speaker is \u201ctruthful in \\(L\\)\u201d iff she\ntries to avoid uttering sentences not true in \\(L\\), and a speaker\nis \u201ctrusting in \\(L\\)\u201d iff she believes that sentences\nuttered by other speakers are true in \\(L\\). Given that this\nconvention prevails, speakers who want to communicate have reason to\nconform to it, which in turn perpetuates the convention. Note that\nLewis\u2019s account avoids the Russell-Quine regress argument from\n section 1.1, since Lewisian convention does not\npresuppose explicit agreement between participants.\n\n\nIn many respects, Lewis\u2019s account descends from Grice\u2019s theory of\nspeaker-meaning. A simplified version of Grice\u2019s account runs as\nfollows: a speaker speaker-means that \\(p\\) iff\nshe performs an action with an intention of inducing the belief that\n\\(p\\) in her audience by means of their recognition of that very\nintention. Although Lewis does not explicitly build speaker-meaning\ninto his analysis of the \u201cactual language\u201d relation, a\nbroadly Gricean communicative mechanism informs his discussion. Like\nGrice, Lewis emphasizes how meaning emerges from coordination between\nthe speaker\u2019s communicative intentions and the hearer\u2019s communicative\nexpectations. Grice does not provide a very compelling account of how\nspeakers and hearers coordinate their communicative intentions and\nexpectations by exploiting a pre-existing practice. Lewis\nfills this lacuna by citing a standing convention of truthfulness and\ntrust.\n\n\nStephen Schiffer (1972) and Jonathan Bennett (1976) offer alternative\n\u201cneo-Gricean\u201d accounts that combine Lewisian convention\nwith more explicit appeal to Gricean speaker-meaning. In effect, both\ntheories are sophisticated variants upon the following:\n\n\nSentence \\(s\\) means that \\(p\\) as used by population\n\\(G\\) iff there prevails in \\(G\\) a convention to use\nutterances of \\(s\\) so as to speaker-mean that \\(p\\).\n\n\nThus, both accounts analyze sentence meaning as the result of a\nconvention that certain sentences are used to communicate certain\npropositions.\n\n\n A fundamental question for philosophy of language is how meaning\narises from use. How do we confer significance upon inherently\nmeaningless linguistic expressions by employing them in linguistic\npractice? Neo-Gricean accounts such as Lewis\u2019s, Schiffer\u2019s, and\nBennett\u2019s provide detailed answers to this question. For instance,\nLewis isolates a self-perpetuating communicative mechanism that\nsystematically associates sentences with propositional contents. He\nreduces social convention to the propositional attitudes of individual\nspeakers, and he then uses social convention to explain how meaning\narises from use. He thereby depicts linguistic expressions as\ninheriting content from antecedently contentful propositional\nattitudes. On this approach, thought is the primary locus of\nintentionality, and language enjoys intentional content merely in a\nderivative way, through its employment in communicative\ntransactions. That general view of the relation between language and\nthought goes back at least to Book III of Locke\u2019s Essay on Human\nUnderstanding. It is currently quite popular. Much of its\npopularity stems from the widespread perception that Lewis\u2019s account,\nor some other such account, successfully explains how language\ninherits content from thought.\n",
