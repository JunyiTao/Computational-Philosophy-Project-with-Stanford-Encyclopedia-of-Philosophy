    "main_text": "Confucianism || The Rise of the Four-Seven Debate\n3.2 The Rise of the Four-Seven Debate\n\nThe new dynasty of Chos\u014fn, which emerged after toppling the Buddhist Kory\u014f dynasty, was strongly supported by the leading Confucian literati of the time. As I mentioned above, Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn in his Array of Critiques against Buddhism (Pulssi chapby\u014fn \u4f5b\u6c0f\u96dc\u8fa8, 1398) launched the most extensive criticisms against Buddhism. But his contribution was not confined to a purely negative polemic. He was also an ideological architect of Neo-Confucian worldview with a full commitment to the order of universal principle in the world dominated by the ki force. But it should be mentioned that Ch\u014fng\u2019s diatribe against Buddhism did not go unanswered and was impressively answered by his Buddhist contemporary Kihwa in the Exposition of Orthodoxy (Hy\u014fnch\u014fng non \u986f\u6b63\u8ad6) where the latter offers alternative, Buddhist interpretations of the project of self-cultivation. Kihwa shows that the question of how most appropriately to cultivate one\u2019s life can be safely answered from a Buddhist perspective in the context of issues of the reproduction of ethical life and established forms of social relationships, the moral psychology of the emotions, and questions of the meaning of suffering and evil. In other words, one can be a Buddhist without forsaking the moral value of benevolence or for that matter filial piety. His response shows a remarkably syncretic, inter-cultural, and ecumenical solution to the abstract problem raised by Ch\u014fng. Buddhism is not nihilism.\n\nWhile Kihwa\u2019s noble effort and his elegant solutions were praiseworthy, it was not meant to buck the decisive trend of the age and it was too isolated to contain the massive wave of Neo-Confucianism, which was the leading Zeitgeist at the time. Succeeding Ch\u014fng, who perished untimely due to a political conflict, Kw\u014fn K\u016dn \u6b0a\u8fd1 (1352\u20131409) and others such as Yi Onj\u014fk \u674e\u5f66\u8fea (1491\u20131553) seamlessly propelled Neo-Confucianism to the status of philosophical orthodoxy. While not fully prepared to be explosive in its creativity and imagination, this phase of Korean Confucianism clearly ushered in a new era of appropriation that nicely prepared the next phase of full development. Among others, Kw\u014fn was the one of the earliest who systematically developed the metaphysics of Principle and Vital Force, suggesting that the heart/mind in us must have its own nature, which is none other than the heavenly principle (ch\u014fnli \u5929\u7406). In other words, the heart/mind is Principle in terms of its Essence, but, in respect of Function, because it is mixed with Vital Force, issues feelings (ch\u014fng \u60c5) or intentions (\u016di \u610f). Unbeknownst to him, Kw\u014fn served as the catalyst for what is known as the \u201cFour-Seven Debate (see below)\u201d (Kim 2016b).\nBut it is in the middle of the sixteenth century that Korean Neo-Confucians were ready to go beyond the stage of mere appropriation and began making rich, dynamic and lively contributions to the in-depth understanding of the central Neo-Confucian ideas. They even brought about new themes not prevalent in the original form of Neo-Confucianism. It is well-known that, with the \u201cFour-Seven Debate\u201d, which originated in the mid-sixteenth century, the Korean Neo-Confucians made a remarkably lively and impressive contribution to the importance of emotions in our examined life. The debate originally took place between T\u2019oegye and Ki Taes\u016dng (1527\u20131572 pen name: Kobong) when they began exchanging letters in the spring of 1559. As \u201cthe most important intellectual event in the entire history of Korean Confucian thought\u201d (Kalton et al. 1994), the debate was prima facie over the origin of Four Sprouts and Seven Emotions (such as joy, anger, love, fear, sorrow, hatred, desire). But when you examine it carefully, you can see that it is about (1) the feasibility of a metaphysics of Principle (i) and Vital Force (ki) in terms of their causal efficacy and normativity and (2) its moral and psychological philosophy of mind, human nature, and feelings, and, most importantly, (3) how best to achieve sagehood despite our emotions in our examined life with bodies.\n\nAt the start of the debate, T\u2019oegye suggested that \n  \n the issuance of the Four Sprouts involves pure i and, therefore involves nothing but good; the issuance of the Seven Emotions includes ki and therefore involves mixture of both good and evil. (The First letter to Kobong, A1a, 1559 Spring, in Yi Hwang [T\u2019oegye] CW, Vol. 1, Book 16, 402a; Kalton et al. 1994, 1).\n  \n\n Let\u2019s call this the thesis of separate issuance. T\u2019oegye\u2019s basic insight here is fundamentally oriented by his profound interest in, and experience of, self-cultivation in what he calls \u201cSage Learning\u201d (see his The Ten Diagrams of Sage Learning in Kalton 1988). T\u2019oegye argued that making an appeal to the multiplicity of the roles played by univocal notion of feelings in the social context did not do any good. The strategy on the part of T\u2019oegye was then to ground the Four Sprouts (and the Heart-mind of the Dao) on the active Principle on the one hand and to ground the Seven Emotions (and the Heart-mind of an ordinary person) on Vital Force, thus drastically bifurcating the feelings in their disparity. In particular, he most cautiously wanted to make sure that the potentially wayward feelings arising from our bodily nature do not undermine the fundamental dynamism towards appropriateness of the Mencian Four Sprouts (Ivanhoe 2015). \n\nNow, in his replies, Kobong criticized the obvious dualism implied by the thesis of separate issuance on the part of T\u2019oegye. He said that both the Four Sprouts and the Seven Emotions are all basic human feelings of one and the same stripe. In his first letter to T\u2019oegye, Kobong audaciously suggests that the Four are a good side to the Seven. Let\u2019s call this the thesis of the continuum between the Four and the Seven. According to Kobong, then T\u2019oegye\u2019s fallacy stemmed ultimately from the latter\u2019s assumption that the Four and the Seven are two separate kinds of feelings and accordingly there are two kinds of good feelings\u2014the ones in the Seven and the ones in the Four. It was also wrong to view Principle and Vital Force as being independent from each other.\n\nLater, the forcible reply on the part of Kobong led T\u2019oegye to concede that both Principle and Vital Force are actually present in the origination of all feelings when the heart-mind is activated, and his attempt to differentiate them in terms of stimulus had to be revised. As part of his response, T\u2019oegye came up with a formula that recognized the interdependent roles of Principle and Vital Force but weighed them differently: in the case of the Seven Emotions, Vital Force gives issue and Principle follows it; in the case of the Four Sprouts, Principle gives issue and Vital Force accords with it (Yi Hwang [T\u2019oegye] CW, Vol. 1, Book 16, 417b). Thus, instead of the original \u201cseparate issuance\u201d theory, T\u2019oegye now proposed a theory of \u201calternate issuance\u201d (hobal \u4e92\u767c) by which Principle would be the one to issue in the case of the Four Sprouts, even though, traditionally, Principle was not considered a self-issuing agent within the Principle-Vital Force relationship (Chung 1995: 73). T\u2019oegye at this point acknowledged that the Four and the Seven are all basic human feelings and that both involve Principle and Vital Force simultaneously when they issue. As he puts it,\n  \n\n Principle and Vital Force need, and depend on, each other: one being an Essence (ch\u2019e) and the other a Function (yon \u7528). (Yi Hwang [T\u2019oegye] CW, Vol. 1, Book 16, 405a)\n  \n However, he still insisted that they are different things because they originate from the different sources. According to him, the Four are related to original human nature because they are, as informed by the heavenly principle, inborn and innately good, while the Seven are related to the physical endowment because they arise from contacts with external objects and can be good or evil. The Seven are not genuine moral feelings. From a Mencian perspective, self-cultivation requires the nourishment of the Four and the exercise of emotional control over the Seven. So, for T\u2019oeyge, the Four together with Principle always maintain its transcendent, independent status regardless of the concrete course of events and also preserves its causal efficacy in initiating the desirable patterns of behavior. As he variously puts it in his works such as \u201cthe Four-Seven Letters\u201d as well as \u201cCritique on the Position that the Heart/Mind does not have Essence and Function\u201d, \u201cPrinciple issues (\u7406\u767c)\u201d, \u201cPrinciple moves (\u7406\u52d5)\u201d and \u201cPrinciple comes into being of itself (\u7406\u81ea\u5230)\u201d (Yi Hwang [T\u2019oegye] CW, Vol. 1, Book 16, 464-465a).\n\nIt is clear that T\u2019oegye stressed the role of Principle in the path to self-cultivation because of its autonomous character. He prescribed that self-cultivation could be attained only by redirecting the blind orientations of Vital Force and nourishing human nature via the practice of \u201cReverent Mindfulness\u201d (ky\u014fng \u656c). In the Ten Diagrams of Sage Learning, T\u2019oegye suggests that \u201cReverent Mindfulness is the beginning and the completion of the sage learning\u201d (Yi Hwang [T\u2019oegye] CW, Vol. 1, Book 7, 203a). This has two aspects, external and internal: Externally, Reverent Mindfulness is always informed and constrained by the Confucian ideal of good behavior conforming to the strict adherence of the rules of propriety (Chung 1995: 134). Thus, Reverent Mindfulness involves being \u201ccautious and watchful in the hidden, secluded places\u201d as well as being \u201cproperly ordered and controlled, grave and quiet\u201d. Internally, the practice of Reverent Mindfulness also involves preserving one\u2019s internal refined state. Already in his Four-Seven debate with Kobong, T\u2019oegye suggested that Reverent Mindfulness is achieved when the original state of heart/mind is maintained by \u201cconcentrating on one thing without departing from it\u201d and also by \u201cregulating the exterior to nourish the interior\u201d (Yi Hwang [T\u2019oegye] CW, Vol. 1, Book 7, 203b; Kalton 1988, 85\u201387).\n\nA few years after T\u2019oegye\u2019s death, a new Four-Seven debate was ignited, this time between Yi I (pen name: Yulgok) and his friend S\u014fng Hon (pen name: Ugye), when the latter sent a letter to the former in 1572. Ugye was an enthusiastic follower of T\u2019oegye\u2019s understanding of the Four-Seven relationship, and thus one can safely assume that Ugye vicariously debated the matter with Yulgok. Following T\u2019oegye, Ugye suggests that the Four Sprouts and Seven Emotions come from Principle and Vital Force respectively. In a famous analogy, Ugye then compares Principle and Vital Force to a rider controlling his horse, just like T\u2019oegye did to explain his alternate issuance theory.\n\nIn response to Ugye, Yulgok insists: \n  \n the Four Sprouts are the good side of the Seven Emotions. The Seven Emotions comprehend the Four Sprouts. (Kalton et al. 1994: 131) \n Thus, on Yulgok, the Four and the Seven are not separate, but the former are rather a proper subset of the latter. Yulgok\u2019s view is important because it pushes us deeper into the nature of aroused feelings. In the presence of good and bad feelings, what makes it possible to say that good feelings are preferable to bad feelings? Yulgok suggests that no real progress can be made if one separates the works of Principle and Vital Force in the relevant situations in life. As for the nature of Principle, Yulgok forcibly denies its transcendent and independent existence as well as its causal efficacy. While Principle \u201cpervades\u201d (itong \u7406\u901a) and Vital Force \u201cdelimits\u201d (kiguk \u5c40), Principle is in and of itself causally impotent and acquires its agency only when it follows Vital Force (Yi I [Yulgok] CW, 10.26a). However, it does not follow that Principle and Vital Force are for this reason independent from each other. Despite Principle\u2019s role as the universal order structuring norms, Vital Force is the only particularizing power that moves things on the model of Principle. Yulgok thus claims: \n  \n In general, Principle is the master of Vital Force, and Vital Force is what Principle mounts upon\u2026. They are not two [separate] things, but again they are not a single thing. They are not a single thing, therefore they are one and yet two; they are not two things, therefore they are two and yet one. (Yi I, [Yulgok] CW, 10.2b)\n\nOn the front of self-cultivation, Yulgok proposes a model of Integrity (s\u014fng \u8aa0) for achieving sagehood (Ro 1989). Integrity is the foundation of self-cultivation because it enables one to nourish one\u2019s own Vital Force, and the heart/mind can be made the master of one\u2019s body and the commander of human nature and feelings through its agency. But Integrity as the source of transforming Vital Force within us does its works exactly because it is the real principle of heaven and the original essence of the mind/heart. The heart/mind then originally possesses Integrity as its inherent moral quality.\n\nThe Four-Seven Debate continued in one form or other down to the beginning of the twentieth century. T\u2019oegye and Yulgok and their opposed strategies for dealing with this challenge tower over the history of Korean Neo-Confucian thought. As a matter of fact, the Four-Seven Debate later spilled over to another debate (\u201cHorak \u6e56\u6d1b Debate\u201d) where Han W\u014fnjin (1681\u20131751) and Yi Kan (1677\u20131727) had a lengthy discussion over whether there is any difference between human nature and sub-human nature, and also over what, and how much, shelter human nature can provide from evil in the context of moral community (R. Kim 2015). It also ignited the Heart/mind (Sims\u014fl \u5fc3\u8aaa) Debate from the middle of the nineteenth century well into the twentieth century.\n",
