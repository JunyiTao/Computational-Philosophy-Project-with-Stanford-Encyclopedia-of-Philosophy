    "main_text": "Common Presuppositions of Classical Indian Schools || The Touchstone of Everyday Speech\n1.2 The Touchstone of Everyday Speech\nEveryday patterns of speech\n(vyavah\u0101ra) are taken as a starting\npoint for theorizing in epistemology as in other areas of philosophy.\nSo, for example, perception and inference\u2014more exotic candidate\nsources, too\u2014are defended as veritable knowledge-generators by the\nobservation that people commonly regard them in that way. People cite a\nbelief\u2019s pedigree in questions of justification. Note that even in\nEnglish we do commonly recognize perception and some of the others as\ncertificational. Thus this seems to be a common human practice, not\nrestricted to classical Indian civilization, for sometimes we say, for\ninstance, \u201cS is indeed over there, since I see him,\u201d and \u201cYou couldn\u2019t\nreally have perceived S because condition Y does not hold\u201d (\u201cYou can\u2019t\nsee anyone from this distance\u201d). Habits of speech are reinforced by\nsuccess in action, classical theorists recognize in accepting the\npresumptive authority of common opinion. But \u201ca knowledge source\u201d may\nbe thought of as a technical term, one that entails factivity, as we\nhave seen, as a matter of definition. Similarly with justification\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya), the having of\nwhich, if veritable (or objective), as opposed to the apparent\n(\u0101bh\u0101sa), means that the justified\ncognition is true.\n",
