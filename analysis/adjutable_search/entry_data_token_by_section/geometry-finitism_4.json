    "main_text": "Some general considerations || Physicists\n1.4 Physicists\n\nAs is commonly known, one of the hot topics in physics is the search\nfor the unification of quantum (field) theory and general relativity\ntheory. If successful, the famous \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d\nwould result. As is equally well-known, the hardest problem to solve\nis how to deal with space-time. Quantum (field) theory requires space\nand time as a background, whereas in general relativity the structure\nof space-time is largely determined by the masses and the energy\npresent. One way out\u2014and most of\n section 3\n deals with such examples\u2014is to find a \u201cdeeper\u201d\nstructure that underlies both theories and that, in a sense, generates\nspace and time from more fundamental concepts. Clearly, if such a\ntheory were to be found, it would not merely produce\n\u201cjust\u201d a model, but it would actually be considered as a\ngenuine representation of reality. Most of these models, speculative\nas some of them may be at the present moment, turn out to be discrete\nand hence these proposals, in contradistinction, e.g., with the\nlogicians, do claim to be a correct description. For a recent informal\noverview, see Rovelli (2016), especially chapter 11, \u201cThe End of\nInfinity\u201d.\n\nTwo remarks need to be made. First, from the mathematical perspective,\nthe focus of this entry is on geometry and not on other possibilities\nto reformulate physical theories in a discrete way. An excellent\nexample of such an alternative is to be found in Carroll (2023), where\nquantum mechanics is made discrete not through space and/or time but\nthrough the Hilbert state space. This space has an infinite number of\ndimensions in the standard presentation but what if there are only a\nfinite (though large) number of dimensions? Secondly, from the\nhistorical perspective, it must be added that on and off some\nphysicist tried to find out what discrete counterparts of existing\nclassical physical theories could look like. Usually the philosophical\nunderpinnings of such an attempt tend to be rather idiosyncratic. In\n section 2\n one such example will be presented. Typically such attempts did not\ncreate a major stir, they quickly disappeared into the background, but\nnevertheless they do contain some interesting and relevant ideas.\n",
