    "main_text": "\n\n This entry is about two kinds of circularity: object\ncircularity, where an object is taken to be part of itself in\nsome sense; and definition circularity, where a collection is\ndefined in terms of itself.  Instances of these two kinds of\ncircularity are sometimes problematic, and sometimes not.  We are\nprimarily interested in object circularity in this entry, especially\ninstances which look problematic when one tries to model them in set\ntheory.  But we shall also discuss circular definitions.\n\n The term non-wellfounded set refers to sets which contain\nthemselves as members, and more generally which are part of an\ninfinite sequence of sets each term of which is an element of the\npreceding set.  So they exhibit object circularity in a blatant way.\nDiscussion of such sets is very old in the history of set theory, but\nnon-wellfounded sets are ruled out of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (the\nstandard theory) due to the Foundation Axiom (FA).  As it happens,\nthere are alternatives to this axiom FA.  This entry is especially\nconcerned with one of them, an axiom first formulated by Marco Forti\nand Furio Honsell in a 1983 paper.  It is now standard to call this principle the\nAnti-Foundation Axiom (AFA), following its treatment in an\ninfluential book written by Peter Aczel in 1988.\n\n The attraction of using AFA is that it gives a set of tools for\nmodeling circular phenomena of various sorts.  These tools are\nconnected to important circular definitions, as we shall see.  We\nshall also be concerned with situating both the mathematics and the\nunderlying intuitions in a broader picture, one derived from work in\ncoalgebra.\nIncorporating concepts and results from category theory,\ncoalgebra leads us to concepts such as corecursion\nand coinduction; these are in a sense duals to the more\nstandard notions of recursion\nand induction.\n\n\n The topic of this entry also has connections to work in game theory\n(the universal Harsanyi type spaces), semantics (especially\nsituation-theoretic accounts, or others where a \u201cworld\u201d is allowed\nto be part of itself), fractals sets and other self-similar sets, the\nanalysis of recursion, category theory, and the philosophical side of\nset theory.\n",
