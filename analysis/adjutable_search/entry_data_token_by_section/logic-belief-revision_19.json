This means that the revision \\(K* p\\) of a belief set\n\\(K\\) by a sentence \\(p\\) can be replaced by a revision \\(k* p\\) of a\nsentence by another sentence. If this revision is non-prioritized, we\nmay treat \\(k\\) and \\(p\\) equally, so that \\(k* p = p* k\\). Such an\noperation can be described as the merging of two belief\nrepresentations. It can represent a process of conflict resolution\nthrough selective combination of information from two agents or\nsources. This operation can also be generalized to the merge of\nseveral elements, representing efforts to combine information from\nseveral agents or sources (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 2011).\n",
