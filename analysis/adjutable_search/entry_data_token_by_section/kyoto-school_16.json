These\nnotebooks document in detail secret meetings regularly held by Kyoto\nSchool members (including Tanabe and Nishitani but not Nishida) at the\nbequest of the Japanese navy between February 1942 and just before the\nend of the war. While on the one hand the existence of these secret\nmeetings demonstrates an even more intimate connection between the\nKyoto School and the military than was previously known, on the other\nhand it is crucially significant that they were in cooperation with a\ncertain moderate faction of the navy, a faction that was opposed to\nthe extremists that dominated the army. There had long existed a\nconsiderable tension between the bellicose arrogance of the army and\nthe comparatively more moderate and worldly stance of the navy. As the\npolitically more powerful army was setting a war-bound course for\nPearl Harbor, some reticent navy officials evidently petitioned the\nKyoto School to shed light on the political situation from their\n\u201cworld-historical standpoint,\u201d presumably in order to sway\npublic sentiment in a more prudent direction.\n\nIn short, the \u201c\u014cshima Memos\u201d help reveal how the\nKyoto School found themselves in a position where they were called on\nto fight a \u201cwar of thought\u201d on two fronts: against Western\nimperialism, they felt called on to delineate a world-historical role\nfor Japan in freeing itself and other Asian peoples from colonization\nand exploitation by the Western empires; and, against Japanese\nultra-nationalism, they felt that it was up to them to convince the\npublic and the military of the illegitimacy of an imperialistic\nresponse to Western imperialism.\n\n\u014cshima Yasuma had himself published, in 1965, an often overlooked\naccount of these meetings under the title, \u201cThe Pacific War and\nthe Kyoto School: On the Political Participation of\nIntellectuals\u201d (\u014cshima 2000, 274\u2013304; also see Horio\n1994, 301ff.). In this article, \u014cshima summarized the evolving\npurpose of the secret Kyoto School meetings in three stages: In the\nvery first meetings (which apparently took place prior to those\ndocumented in the recovered notebooks), the main theme was \u201chow\nto avoid the outbreak of war.\u201d Since war in fact broke out very\nsoon thereafter, the theme quickly switched to \u201chow to bring the\nwar to a favorable end as soon as possible, by way of rationally\npersuading the army.\u201d To do this they reportedly agreed that it\nwould be necessary to overthrow the cabinet of T\u014dj\u014d Hideki.\nHowever, according to \u014cshima, all criticism of T\u014dj\u014d and\nthe army had to be expurgated in the discussions published in the\npages of Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron, and the statements of the\nKyoto School had to be \u201cveiled in two or three layers of\ncloth\u201d in order to avoid censorship and persecution. Towards the\nend of the war, the theme of the secret meetings is said to have\nchanged to that of \u201chow to handle the postwar\nsituation.\u201d\n\nAmong these three themes only the second is recorded in any detail in\nthe notebooks that were discovered and published by \u014chashi as the\n\u201c\u014cshima Memos.\u201d Although there may well have been\npreliminary discussions on how to avoid war, more explicit references\nto overthrowing T\u014dj\u014d Hideki, and more lengthy discussions\nabout postwar issues, these do not in fact show up in the recovered\nnotebooks. Nevertheless, the \u201c\u014cshima Memos\u201d do show\nus a more detailed and uncensored account of the Kyoto School\u2019s\n\u201cwar of thought\u201d on two fronts during a tumultuous and\ntragic time of what was, in fact, Japan\u2019s imperialistic response\nto Western imperialism.\n",
