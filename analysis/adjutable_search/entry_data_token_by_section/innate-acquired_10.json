    "main_text": "Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates || Innateness as a psychological primitive\n2.3 Innateness as a psychological primitive\n\nRichard Samuels (1998; 2002; 2004; 2007) has developed a version of\nCowie\u2019s mystery hypothesis called psychological primitivism. On\nthis view, that a belief or behavior is \u2018innate\u2019 means\nthat it serves as an explanatory primitive for psychological science.\nAn explanatory primitive is a concept that is deployed by a discipline\nto explain certain phenomena, but which cannot in principle be\nexplained by that discipline. Samuels maintains that there is a sharp\nexplanatory boundary between psychology and other fields. A necessary\ncondition for any psychological explanation, he claims, is that it\napply to the whole organism and not to a specific (sub-personal)\ncomponent (Samuels 1998). This condition excludes many explanations\ncouched in neurobiological terms, because they apply to sub-personal\ncomponents and not to the organism as a whole. However, there are\nother predicates that apply to the whole organism and yet do not\nqualify as psychological (e.g being a carnivore). So, the\npersonal/sub-personal distinction is not sufficient for marking the\nboundary that Samuels wants to draw. As a result it is not entirely\nclear how to draw the line between psychological and non-psychological\nphenomena. Samuels examples of psychological explanations feature\nprocesses such as conditioning, perception, and inference; whereas\nneurological and hormonal explanations purportedly fall outside\npsychology (Samuels 1998; 2002; 2004). Some authors criticize\nSamuels\u2019 primitivism on the grounds that this sharp distinction\nbetween psychology and other sciences does not exist (Gross and Rey\n2012; Linquist 2018). For example, psychological explanations of\ndepression and anxiety cite both intentional states and sub-personal\nprocesses as components of the same mechanism. The issue of how\npsychological explanations are related to biological explanations is\none of the most pressing questions in the philosophy of cognitive\nscience and has recently been explored in the context of debates over\nmechanistic explanation (see Gaj 2016; Milkowski, et al. 2019 for\nreviews).\n\nA further problem with Samuels\u2019s primitivism is that some\n\u201cbiological\u201d (i.e. not psychologically explainable) events\ncan have pronounced psychological effects over an individual\u2019s\nlifetime. For example, someone who undergoes brain trauma or suffers\nfrom the overuse of pharmaceuticals might thereby acquire certain\nbeliefs or behaviors. Phineas Gage, the 19th century\nrailroad worker who became famous for surviving a massive brain\ninjury, is reported to have acquired several new personality traits\nafter an iron rod pierced his prefrontal cortex (Twomey 2010). Samuels\nworries that according to primitivism such traits would be innate\nsince they cannot, by hypothesis, be explained in psychological terms.\nHe worries that this would be highly counterintuitive.\n\nTo avoid such implications, Samuels shores up his proposal with a\nproviso: a psychological structure is innate just in case it is\npsychologically primitive and it would develop under normal\nconditions for a member of the species. This move has prompted\nsome philosophers to generate further counterexamples of acquired\ntraits that are psychologically unexplainable but nonetheless emerge\nunder \u201cnormal\u201d conditions (e.g. Khalidi 2007). A deeper\nquestion, however, concerns the very notion of a \u201cnormal\u201d\ndevelopmental environment. Spelling out this idea is no easy matter.\nPresumably, a necessary condition for some environment to qualify as\nnormal for a species is that it was encountered ancestrally. But this\nraises the twin problems of how far back in time is relevant, and how\ncan we classify environments as types. Samuels argues that these\nproblems plague any discipline that appeals to the notion of a normal\nenvironment and are thus not unique to psychology. However, it remains\nan open question whether the concept of normal environment can made\ncoherent. We return to this issue in Section 3.4 (below).\n",
