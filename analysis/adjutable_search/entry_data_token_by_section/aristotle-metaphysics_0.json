    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n1. The Subject Matter of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nAristotle himself described his subject matter in a variety of ways:\nas \u2018first philosophy\u2019, or \u2018the study of being qua\nbeing\u2019, or \u2018wisdom\u2019, or \u2018theology\u2019. A\ncomment on these descriptions will help to clarify Aristotle\u2019s\ntopic.\n\nIn Metaphysics \u0391.1, Aristotle says that \u201ceveryone\ntakes what is called \u2018wisdom\u2019 (sophia) to be\nconcerned with the primary causes (aitia) and the\nstarting-points (or principles, archai)\u201d\n(981b28), and it is these causes and principles that he\nproposes to study in this work. It is his customary practice to begin\nan inquiry by reviewing the opinions previously held by others, and\nthat is what he does here, as Book \u0391 continues with a history of\nthe thought of his predecessors about causes and principles.\n\nThese causes and principles are clearly the subject matter of what he\ncalls \u2018first philosophy\u2019. But this does not mean the\nbranch of philosophy that should be studied first. Rather, it concerns\nissues that are in some sense the most fundamental or at the highest\nlevel of generality. Aristotle distinguished between things that are\n\u201cbetter known to us\u201d and things that are \u201cbetter\nknown in\n themselves,\u201d[1]\n and maintained that we should begin our study of a given topic with\nthings better known to us and arrive ultimately at an understanding of\nthings better known in themselves. The principles studied by\n\u2018first philosophy\u2019 may seem very general and abstract, but\nthey are, according to Aristotle, better known in themselves, however\nremote they may seem from the world of ordinary experience. Still,\nsince they are to be studied only by one who has already studied\nnature (which is the subject matter of the Physics), they are\nquite appropriately described as coming \u201cafter the\nPhysics.\u201d\n\nAristotle\u2019s description \u2018the study of being qua\nbeing\u2019 is frequently and easily misunderstood, for it seems to\nsuggest that there is a single (albeit special) subject\nmatter\u2014being qua being\u2014that is under investigation. But\nAristotle\u2019s description does not involve two things\u2014(1) a\nstudy and (2) a subject matter (being qua being)\u2014for he did not\nthink that there is any such subject matter as \u2018being qua\nbeing\u2019. Rather, his description involves three things: (1) a\nstudy, (2) a subject matter (being), and (3) a manner in which the\nsubject matter is studied (qua being).\n\nAristotle\u2019s Greek word that has been Latinized as\n\u2018qua\u2019 means roughly \u2018in so far as\u2019 or\n\u2018under the aspect\u2019. A study of x qua y,\nthen, is a study of x that concerns itself solely with the\ny aspect of x. So Aristotle\u2019s study does not\nconcern some recondite subject matter known as \u2018being qua\nbeing\u2019. Rather it is a study of being, or better, of\nbeings\u2014of things that can be said to be\u2014that studies them\nin a particular way: as beings, in so far as they are beings.\n\nOf course, first philosophy is not the only field of inquiry to study\nbeings. Natural science and mathematics also study beings, but in\ndifferent ways, under different aspects. The natural scientist studies\nthem as things that are subject to the laws of nature, as things that\nmove and undergo change. That is, the natural scientist studies things\nqua movable (i.e., in so far as they are subject to change). The\nmathematician studies things qua countable and measurable. The\nmetaphysician, on the other hand, studies them in a more general and\nabstract way\u2014qua beings. So first philosophy studies the causes\nand principles of beings qua beings. In \u0393.2, Aristotle adds that\nfor this reason it studies the causes and principles of substances\n(ousiai). We will explain this connection in Section 3\nbelow.\n\nIn Book \u0395, Aristotle adds another description to the study of\nthe causes and principles of beings qua beings. Whereas natural\nscience studies objects that are material and subject to change, and\nmathematics studies objects that although not subject to change are\nnevertheless not separate from (i.e., independent of) matter, there is\nstill room for a science that studies things (if indeed there are any)\nthat are eternal, not subject to change, and independent of matter.\nSuch a science, he says, is theology, and this is the\n\u201cfirst\u201d and \u201chighest\u201d science.\nAristotle\u2019s identification of theology, so conceived, with the\nstudy of being qua being has proved challenging to his interpreters.\nWe discuss this identification in\n Section 14\n below.\n\nFinally, we may note that in Book \u0392, Aristotle delineates his\nsubject matter in a different way, by listing the problems or\nperplexities (aporiai) he hopes to deal with. Characteristic\nof these perplexities, he says, is that they tie our thinking up in\nknots. They include the following, among others: Are sensible\nsubstances the only ones that exist, or are there others besides them?\nIs it kinds or individuals that are the elements and principles of\nthings? And if it is kinds, which ones: the most generic or the most\nspecific? Is there a cause apart from matter? Is there anything apart\nfrom material compounds? Are the principles limited, either in number\nor in kind? Are the principles of perishable things themselves\nperishable? Are the principles universal or particular, and do they\nexist potentially or actually? Are mathematical objects (numbers,\nlines, figures, points) substances? If they are, are they separate\nfrom or do they always belong to sensible things? And (\u201cthe\nhardest and most perplexing of all,\u201d Aristotle says) are unity\nand being the substance of things, or are they attributes of some\nother subject? In the remainder of Book \u0392, Aristotle presents\narguments on both sides of each of these issues, and in subsequent\nbooks he takes up many of them again. But it is not always clear\nprecisely how he resolves them, and it is possible that Aristotle did\nnot think that the Metaphysics contains definitive solutions\nto all of these perplexities.\n",
