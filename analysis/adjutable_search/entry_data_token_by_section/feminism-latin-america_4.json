As\nthe century came to a close, critiquing (marginal) voices emerged,\narguing that liberal feminism tended to overlook difference, inequity,\nand exclusion amongst women located in vastly different social and\ncultural locations (Coba & Herrera 2013: 18). The Eighth Encuentro\n(November 1999) held in Juan Dolio, Dominican Republic, reflected the\npresence of these emerging voices as dominant feminisms\u2019\n\u201cOthers\u201d: Indigenous women, Afro-descended women, and\nlesbians whose position relative to the Encuentros had been marginal.\nThe claims of inclusivity and diversity of the Encuentros were brought\nunder critical scrutiny as they argued that their identities had been\nobscured under liberal feminism, which took gender to be\ncharacteristic of a foundational unity for the encounters. These\ndesencuentros (\u201cdisencounters\u201d) formed the basis\nof new social and political critique that characterized the emerging\nvoices.\n\nIn response to the neoliberal shifts of the 80s and 90s, the early\n21st century brought with it an anti-neoliberal discourse\nto Latin American feminisms that was further fed by decolonial and\nanti-patriarchal stances. Amongst these were positions that argued for\nthe decolonization of universal feminism by taking into account the\naxes of race, ethnicity, and sexuality in the articulations of\nidentity. The 2000s were also marked by an attempt to dry out the\ninstitutionalization of gender. At the same time, there has not been\nan impetus to reconfigure a social movement in the wake of neoliberal\nshifts (Coba & Herrera 2013: 19).\n\nWe are currently witnessing an emergence of ideas that is starting to\nreshape how we think about Latin American feminisms. However, the\nproject of reconfiguration is still very much in process. In this\ncontext, critical ideas about race and the history of racism have\nentered mainstream concerns, predominantly voiced from Afro-descended\nstandpoints (Curiel 2007). Further, lesbian feminists have brought\nforth criticisms of liberal feminism for not only paying less\nattention to race and racism, but also for centering on\nheteronormativity as part of the feminist agenda. One notable position\nholds that there is an inextricable link between lesbianism and\nfeminism insofar as the adoption of a self-conscious feminism entails\nshifting engagement with dominant masculinity on all levels and this\nincludes the realm of desire (Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso 2011: 403).\nIndigenous feminists have also uncovered critical insights in the\nrelationships among community, the state, and political belonging.\nTheir ideas about the balance between ethnic belonging and critiques\nof sexism are a call to dominant liberal feminism to rethink its\nconcept of culture and community that risks reducing Indigenous women\nto targets of development (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164). The emergence of\nthese critical ideas takes liberal feminism to task by calling out the\ndominance of middle-class, white/mestiza, and heteronormative\nmodels for feminist projects as not only exclusionary, but also\nprofoundly harmful. Notably, most of these positions take\ndecolonization as an orienting project and maintain that racism and\nheterosexism are rooted in colonialism whose impact continues to\nplague Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nIn 2007, GLEFAS (Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio, Formac\u00edon y\nAcci\u00f3n Feminista) was founded with the intention of creating a\nspace for dialogue within the lesbian and feminist movement in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean as well as with other social and land\nstruggle movements in the region. They self-describe as seeking to\nproduce political analysis from an anti-racist, anti-military,\nanti-colonial, anti-capitalist, lesbian feminist perspective. In line\nwith their philosophical vision, they published Tejiendo de otro\nmodo: Feminismo, epistemolog\u00eda y apuestas decoloniales en Abya\nYala (2014b) as an outgrowth of a colloquium held in Chapel Hill,\nNorth Carolina in 2012. The book brings together a diverse group of\ncontemporary voices that intervene on hegemonic understandings of\nfeminism in the region in order to make room for a collective that\nappreciates the diversity of knowledges. Speaking from the margins,\nthe book takes as its central claim that decolonization is concomitant\nwith de-patriarchialization. Hence, it reflects a shift in\ncontemporary Latin American feminist writings that are paving the way\nfor critical considerations of capitalism, imperialism, democracy, and\nidentity. These new voices of dissent are changing the landscape of\nLatin American feminisms with unique ideas that call for rethinking\nwhat it means to be a feminist today.\n",
