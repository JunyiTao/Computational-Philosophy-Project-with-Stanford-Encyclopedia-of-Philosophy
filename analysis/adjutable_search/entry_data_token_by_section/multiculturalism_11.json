Political retreat from multiculturalism?\n\nThe biggest challenge to multiculturalism today may not be philosophical but\npolitical: a political retreat or backlash against immigrant\nmulticulturalism in particular. Some scholars have diagnosed a\n\u201cretreat\u201d from multiculturalism in Europe and Australia,\nwhich they attribute to a lack of public support based partly on the\nlimited success of such policies to foster the integration of\nminorities (Joppke 2004, McGhee 2008). But other scholars argue there\nis lack of evidence of any such retreat. Based on their analysis of\nBritish policies, Varun Uberoi and Tariq Modood find that legal\nexemptions for minority religious practices, anti-discrimination\nmeasures, and multicultural education policies remain in place, and\nthere is no country-wide evidence suggesting that public services are\nno longer delivered in different languages (2013, 134). Further\nresearch is needed on whether and why there has been a retreat from\nmulticulturalism policies.\n\nPerhaps the claim about a \u201cretreat\u201d from multiculturalism\nhas less to do with any actual changes in state policies and more with\nconcerns about lack of social unity and increasing tensions among\ndiverse groups in liberal democratic societies and the sense that\nmulticulturalism is somehow to blame. Consider then-Prime Minister\nDavid Cameron\u2019s 2011 speech: \u201cUnder the doctrine of state\nmulticulturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live\nseparate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream.\nWe\u2019ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they [young\nMuslims] feel they want to belong\u201d (Cameron 2011). According to\nCameron, multiculturalism stands for separation and division, not\nintegration and unity. But the survey of different theories of\nmulticulturalism above demonstrates that most theories of immigrant\nmulticulturalism do not aim at separation but rather devising fairer\nterms of inclusion for religious and cultural minorities into\nmainstream society (Kymlicka 1995).\n\nGoing forward, public debate about immigrant multiculturalism should be pursued in a\nbroader context that considers the politics of immigration, race,\nreligion, and national security. Multiculturalism may become an easy\nrhetorical scapegoat for public fear and anxiety whenever national\nsecurity is seen to be threatened and when economic conditions are bad. In\nEurope, concerns about the radicalization of Muslim minorities have\nbecome central to public debates about immigration and\nmulticulturalism. This was especially true in the face of the European\nmigration crisis as over a million people fleeing war and violence in\nSyria, Iraq, and elsewhere made perilous journeys by sea and land\ninto Europe. This crisis tapped into fears about terrorism and security, especially after the November 2015 Paris and July 2016 Nice attacks; it also renewed concerns about the limits\nof past efforts to integrate newcomers and their descendants. Evidence\nfrom across Europe suggests that Muslims are struggling to succeed in\neducation and the labor market in comparison to other religious and\ncultural minorities (Givens 2007).\n\nSocioeconomic and political marginalization interacts with immigrants\u2019 own sense of belonging: it is hard to imagine newcomers feeling integrated before they make\nsignificant steps toward socioeconomic integration. Integration is a two-way street: not only must immigrants work to integrate themselves, but the state itself must make accommodations to facilitate integration, as many multicultural theorists have emphasized. As\nCecile Laborde observes, North African youth in France are\n\u201croutinely blamed for not being integrated,\u201d but this\nblame \u201cconfuses French society\u2019s institutional responsibility to\nintegrate immigrants with immigrants\u2019 personal failure to integrate\ninto society\u201d (Laborde 2008, 208). The challenge of integrating\nimmigrants has been heightened by increasing public acceptability of\nexpressions of anti-Muslim sentiment. The rise of far-right political\nparties and their anti-Muslim publicity campaigns, coupled with the\nmedia\u2019s willingness to report, often uncritically, their positions\ndamage the prospects for integrating Muslims in Europe (Lenard 2010,\n311). Muslim political leaders report that it is \u201cpart of\nmainstream public dialogue\u201d to refer to the \u201cmenace of\nforeign cultures and the threat posed by immigrants in general, and\nMuslims in particular, to social solidarity and cultural\nhomogeneity\u201d (Klausen 2005, 123). Muslims have been, in\nLaborde\u2019s words, \u201creduced to their presumed identity, culture,\nor religion, and consequently stigmatized as immigrant, Arab, or\nMuslim\u201d (2008, 17). The challenges posed by integrating Muslims\nare thought to be more complex than the challenges of integrating\nearlier waves of immigrants, but as Patti Lenard argues, this alleged\ncomplexity derives from the simplistic and unfair elision between\nIslamic fundamentalism and the vast majority of Muslim minorities in\nEurope who desire integration on fairer terms of the sort that\nmulticulturalists defend (Lenard 2010, 318).\n\nIn light of these concerns with immigrant multiculturalism,\nmulticultural theorists need to continue to make the case that the\nideal of multicultural citizenship stands for fairer terms of\nintegration, not separation and division, and offer answers to\nquestions such as: Why is multicultural citizenship more desirable\nthan the traditional liberal ideal of common citizenship based on a\nuniform set of rights and opportunities for everyone? Are\nmulticulturalism policies actually fostering greater integration of\nimmigrants and their descendants? How should we think about the\nrelationship between multiculturalism and struggles to address\ninequalities based on race, indigeneity, class, gender, sexuality, and\ndisability? It is also important to study the development of\nmulticulturalism beyond the West, including whether and how Western\ntheories and practices of multiculturalism have traveled and been\nincorporated. For example, what lessons have states that only recently\nopened up to significant immigration, such as South Korea, drawn from\nthe experiences of other states, and what sorts of multiculturalism\npolicies have they adopted and why?
