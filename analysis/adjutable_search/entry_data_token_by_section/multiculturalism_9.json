Focusing on Taylor\u2019s theory\nof the politics of recognition, Glen Coulthard has argued that\n\u201cinstead of ushering in an era of peaceful coexistence grounded\non the Hegelian idea of reciprocity, the politics of\nrecognition in its contemporary form promises to reproduce the very\nconfigurations of colonial power that indigenous peoples\u2019 demands for\nrecognition have historically sought to transcend\u201d (2007, 438\u20139;\nsee also Coulthard 2014). There are several elements to Coulthard\u2019s\ncritique. First, he argues that the politics of recognition, through\nits focus on reformist state redistributionist schemes like granting\ncultural rights and concessions to aboriginal communities, affirms\nrather than challenges the political economy of colonialism. In this\nregard, the politics of recognition reveals itself to be a variant of\nliberalism, which \u201cfails to confront the structural/economic\naspects of colonialism at its generative roots\u201d (2007, 446).\nSecond, the contemporary politics of recognition toward indigenous\ncommunities rests on a flawed sociological assumption: that both\nparties engaged in the struggle for recognition are mutually dependent\non one another\u2019s acknowledgement for their freedom and self-worth.\nYet, no such mutual dependency exists in actual relations between\nnation-states and indigenous communities: \u201cthe master\u2014that\nis, the colonial state and state society\u2014does not require\nrecognition from the previously self-determining communities upon\nwhich its territorial, economic, and social infrastructure is\nconstituted\u201d (451). Third, Coulthard argues that true\nemancipation for the colonized cannot occur without struggle and\nconflict that \u201cserves as the mediating force through which the\ncolonized come to shed their colonial identities\u201d (449). He\nemploys Frantz Fanon to argue that the road to true self-determination\nfor the oppressed lies in self-affirmation: rather than depending on\ntheir oppressors for their freedom and self-worth, \u201cthe\ncolonized must initiate the process of decolonization by recognizing\nthemselves as free, dignified and distinct contributors to\nhumanity\u201d (454). This means that indigenous peoples should\n\u201ccollectively redirect our struggles away from a politics that\nseeks to attain a conciliatory form of settler-state recognition for\nIndigenous nations toward a resurgent politics of recognition premised\non self-actualization, direct action, and the resurgence of cultural\npractices that are attentive to the subjective and structural\ncomposition of settler-colonial power\u201d (2014, 24).\n\nTaylor, Kymlicka, and other proponents of the contemporary politics of\nrecognition might agree with Coulthard that self-affirmation by\noppressed groups is critical for true self-determination and freedom\nof indigenous communities, but such self-affirmation need not be\nviewed as mutually exclusive from state efforts to extend\ninstitutional accommodations. State recognition of self-government\nrights and other forms of accommodation are important steps toward\nrectifying historical injustices and transforming structural\ninequalities between the state and indigenous communities. Coulthard\u2019s\nanalysis redirects attention to the importance of evaluating and\nchallenging the structural and psycho-affective dimensions of colonial\ndomination, but by arguing that indigenous peoples should \u201cturn\naway\u201d (2007, 456) from settler-states and settler societies may\nplay into the neoliberal turn toward the privatization of dependency\nand to risk reinforcing the marginalization of indigenous communities\nat a time when economic and other forms of state support may be\ncritical to the survival of indigenous communities.\n",
