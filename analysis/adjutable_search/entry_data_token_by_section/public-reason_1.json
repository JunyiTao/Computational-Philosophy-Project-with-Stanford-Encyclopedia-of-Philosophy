    "main_text": "Why Public Reason? || Rationality and Morality\n1.1 Rationality and Morality\n\nSome philosophers present the idea of public reason, or the public use\nof reason, as an essential and central part of the nature of rational\ndiscourse about moral norms. Habermas\u2019s influential account of\ndiscourse ethics (Habermas 1990; Habermas 1996) has been presented by\nsome as grounding a conception of public reason in this way. On this\nview, the validity of moral and political norms can only be\nestablished by an intersubjective and idealized practice of\nargumentation. Only through an inclusive and noncoercive discursive\nprocess where all participants are equally situated can genuinely\nintersubjectively valid norms emerge. Habermas thus proposes a\ndialogical principle of universalization, (U), stating that a moral\nnorm \u201cis valid just in case the foreseeable consequences and\nside-effects of its general observance for the interests and\nvalue-orientations of each individual could be\njointly accepted by all concerned without\ncoercion\u201d (Habermas 1998, 42). For Habermas, this principle\nfollows from the presuppositions of rational moral discourse. Thus, at\nleast on one interpretation, to engage in reasoned moral or political\nargument with others is to commit oneself to something like the idea\nof public reason\u2014to commit oneself to finding norms that could\nbe jointly accepted by all concerned without coercion. On this\naccount, public reason is grounded in the nature of reasoned moral\nargument: one cannot, without contradiction, avoid the idea of public\nreason insofar as one wants to engage in reasoned moral or political\nargument with others.\n\nAlthough Habermas\u2019s account of discourse ethics has been\ninfluential amongst those who favor some version of discursive or\ndeliberative democracy (Bohman 1996; Chambers 1996; Dryzek 1990;\nDryzek 2000), its capacity to serve as the basis for public reason is\nthe subject of a number of criticisms. Perhaps most importantly, by\ngrounding public reason in a broader account of truth, validity, and\nrational argument, public reason becomes tied to a specific and\ncontroversial philosophical doctrine. But some proponents of public\nreason believe its role is to serve as a mechanism of justification\namongst persons who reasonably disagree about philosophical and other\nissues typically embedded in what Rawls calls comprehensive\ndoctrines (Rawls 1996, 13). If one believes the idea of public\nreason should stand apart from any particular comprehensive doctrine\nor philosophical theory of truth and rationality, the appeal to the\npresuppositions of rational discourse will be a problematic basis for\npublic reason (see Rawls 1996, 376\u2013381).\n\nOthers, most notably Gaus, argue that the idea of public reason\nfollows from certain basic features of our everyday moral practices\nand reactive attitudes, along with certain claims about the nature of\nreasons (Gaus 2011). On this view, social morality involves a\nparticular kind of interpersonal relationship; one where we claim the\nstanding to make demands of others, and where, under the right\nconditions, we acknowledge the standing of others to make demands on\nus (Gaus 2011, 184). But for this sort of relationship to exist, we\nmust believe that when we make moral demands of others, those others\nhave sufficient reasons to comply with our demands\u2014if they did\nnot have sufficient reasons to comply, then the reactive attitudes\nthat form an essential part of the interpersonal relationship of\nsocial morality would cease to make sense (Gaus 2011, 205\u2013232).\nIf, as Gaus maintains, different people have different reasons\ndepending on their differing epistemic positions and sets of justified\nbeliefs, the practice of making moral demands of others must involve\npublic reason: the moral demands we make on others must be justifiable\nto those others by appeal to reasons they have, and not simply by\nappeal to the truth as we see it.\n\nAlthough it differs from discourse ethics in important respects, this\naccount also promises to ground public reason in a broader account of\nthe nature of social morality and epistemology. It is thus also\nvulnerable to similar worries about whether public reason ought to be\nembedded in a comprehensive and controversial philosophical theory of\nmorality and epistemology. For criticisms of the effort to\njustify public reason in part by appeal to the reactive attitudes see\n(Tahzib 2019; Taylor 2018).\n",
