    "main_text": "Visual thinking and proof || The reliability question\n3.1 The reliability question\nThe negative view stated earlier that diagrams can have no role in\nproof entails claim (a). The idea behind (a) is that, because\ndiagrammatic reasoning is unreliable, if a process of thinking through\nan argument contains some non-superfluous diagrammatic thinking, that\nprocess lacks the epistemic security to be a case of thinking through\na proof.\nThis view, claim (a) in particular, is threatened by cases in which\nthe reliability of the diagrammatic thinking is demonstrated\nnon-visually. The clearest kind of example would be provided by a\nformal system which has diagrams in place of formulas among its\nsyntactic objects, and types of inter-diagram transition for inference\nrules. Suppose you take in such a formal system and an interpretation\nof it, and then think through a proof of the system\u2019s soundness\nwith respect to that interpretation; suppose you then inspect a\nsequence of diagrams, checking along the way that it constitutes a\nderivation in the system; suppose finally that you recover the\ninterpretation to reach a conclusion. (The order is unimportant: one\ncan go through the derivation first and then follow the soundness\nproof.) That entire process would constitute thinking through a proof\nof the conclusion; and the diagrammatic thinking involved would not be\nsuperfluous.\nShin et al. (2013) report that formal diagrammatic systems of logic\nand geometry have been proven to be sound. People have indeed followed\nproofs in these systems. That is enough to refute claim (a), the claim\nthat all diagrammatic thinking in thinking through a proof is\nsuperfluous. For a concrete example, Figure 1\npresents a derivation of Euclid\u2019s first theorem, that on any\nstraight line segment an equilateral triangle is constructible, in a\nformal diagrammatic system of a part of Euclidean geometry (Miller\n2001).\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nWhat about Tennant\u2019s claim that a proof is \u201ca syntactic\nobject consisting only of sentences\u201d as opposed to diagrams? A\nproof is never a syntactic object. A formal derivation on its\nown is a syntactic object but not a proof. Without an interpretation\nof the language of the formal system the end-formula of the derivation\nsays nothing; and so nothing is proved. Without a demonstration of the\nsystem\u2019s soundness with respect to the interpretation, one may\nlack sufficient reason to believe that all derivable conclusions are\ntrue. A formal derivation plus an interpretation and\nsoundness proof can be a proof of the derived conclusion, but that\nwhole package is not a syntactic object. Moreover, the part of the\nproof which really is a syntactic object, the formal derivation, need\nnot consist solely of sentences; it can consist of diagrams.\nWith claim (a) disposed of, consider again claim (b) that, while\nnot all diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking through a proof\nis superfluous, all non-superfluous diagrammatic thinking will be\nreplaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking\nthrough that same proof. The visual thinking in following the proof of\nEuclid\u2019s first theorem using Miller\u2019s formal system\nconsists in going through a sequence of diagrams and at each step\nseeing that the next diagram results from a permitted alteration of\nthe previous diagram. It is clear that in a process that counts as\nthinking through this proof, the diagrammatic thinking is\nneither superfluous nor replaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking. That\nknocks out (b), leaving only (c): some thinking that involves a\ndiagram in thinking through a proof is neither superfluous nor\nreplaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking (without changing the\nproof).\n",
