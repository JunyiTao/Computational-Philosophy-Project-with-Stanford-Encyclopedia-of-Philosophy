Second Definition (D2): \u201cKnowledge is True Judgement\u201d: 187b\u2013201c\n\n\n151\u2013187 has considered and rejected the proposal that knowledge is\nperception. Sometimes in 151\u2013187 \u201cperception\u201d seems to\nmean \u201cimmediate sensory awareness\u201d; at other times it\nseems to mean \u201cjudgements made about immediate sensory\nawareness.\u201d The proposal that \u201cKnowledge is immediate\nsensory awareness\u201d is rejected as incoherent: \u201cKnowledge\nis not to be found in our bodily experiences, but in our reasonings\nabout those experiences\u201d (186d2). The proposal that\n\u201cKnowledge is judgement about immediate sensory awareness\u201d\nraises the question how judgements, or beliefs, can emerge\nfrom immediate sensory awareness.  Answering this question is the\nmain aim in 187\u2013201.\n\n\nEmpiricists claim that sensation, which in itself has no cognitive\ncontent, is the source of all beliefs, which essentially have\ncognitive content\u2014which are by their very nature candidates for\ntruth or falsity. So unless we can explain how beliefs can be true or\nfalse, we cannot explain how there can be beliefs at all. Hence\nPlato\u2019s interest in the question of false belief. What Plato wants to\nshow in 187\u2013201 is that there is no way for the empiricist to\nconstruct contentful belief from contentless sensory awareness\nalone. The corollary is, of course, that we need something else\nbesides sensory awareness to explain belief. In modern terms, we need\nirreducible semantic properties. In Plato\u2019s terms, we need\nthe Forms.\n\n\nIn pursuit of this strategy of argument in 187\u2013201, Plato rejects in\nturn five possible empiricist explanations of how there can be false\nbelief. In the First Puzzle (188a\u2013c) he proposes a basic \ndifficulty for any empiricist. Then he argues that no move available\nto the empiricist circumvents this basic difficulty, however much\ncomplexity it may introduce (the other four Puzzles: 188d\u2013201b). The\nFifth Puzzle collapses back into the Third Puzzle, and the Third\nPuzzle collapses back into the First. The proposal that gives us the\nFourth Puzzle is disproved by the counter-examples that make the Fifth\nPuzzle necessary. As for the Second Puzzle, Plato deploys this to show\nhow empiricism has the disabling drawback that it turns an outrageous\nsophistical argument into a valid disproof of the possibility of at\nleast some sorts of false belief.\n\n\nThus 187\u2013201 continues the critique of perception-based accounts of\nknowledge that 151\u2013187 began. Contrary to what some\u2014for instance\nCornford\u2014have thought, it is no digression from the main path of the\nTheaetetus. On the contrary, the discussion of false belief\nis the most obvious way forward.\n\n\nAs Plato stresses throughout the dialogue, it is Theaetetus who is\ncaught in this problem about false belief. It is not Socrates, nor\nPlato. There is clear evidence at Philebus 38c ff. that false\nbelief (at least of some sorts) was no problem at all to Plato himself\n(at least at some points in his career). Plato\u2019s question is not\n\u201cHow on earth can there be false judgement?\u201d Rather it is\n\u201cWhat sort of background assumptions about knowledge must\nTheaetetus be making, given that he is puzzled by the question how\nthere can be false judgement?\u201d\n\n\nIs it only false judgements of identity that are at issue in\n187\u2013201, or is it any false judgement? One interpretation of\n187\u2013201 says that it is only about false judgements of\nmisidentification. Call this view misidentificationism. The\nmain alternative interpretation of 187\u2013201 says that it is about any\nand every false judgement. Call this view\nanti-misidentificationism. The present discussion assumes the truth of\nanti-misidentificationism; see Chappell 2005: 154\u2013157 for the\narguments.\n\n\nI turn to the detail of the five proposals about how to explain false\nbelief that occupy Stephanus pages 187 to 200 of the dialogue.\n",
