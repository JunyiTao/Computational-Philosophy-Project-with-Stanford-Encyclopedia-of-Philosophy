Well certainly pretty well\neveryone thinks that what happened in the past cannot be undone. The\npast cannot now be altered. For if one were to undo the past, that\nwould mean that something which did happen did not happen; or, at the\nvery least, that it was true that something happened and then later\nwas not true that it happened. Most people (but not such a large\nmajority) also think that something else is impossible, namely\naffecting what happened in the past or causing something to have\nhappened in the past. (This is not the same thing, of course, as\naltering the past. If one caused something to have happened, one would\nnot thereby bring it about that something that did not happen did\nhappen.) But it is one thing to think that one cannot make it true\nthat there was a sea-battle yesterday, and quite another thing to\nthink that one cannot make it true yesterday that there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow.\n\nThis might be called the Ockhamist solution to the problem. What\nOckham (c1285\u20131347) says is:\n\nSome propositions are about the present as regards both their wording\nand their subject matter (secundum vocem et secundum rem).\nWhere such [propositions] are concerned, it is universally true that\nevery true proposition about the present has [corresponding to it] a\nnecessary one about the past\u2026 Other propositions are about the\npresent as regards their wording only and are equivalently about the\nfuture, since their truth depends on propositions about the future.\n(Ockham, Predestination, God\u2019s Foreknowledge and Future\nContingents, 46\u20137)\n\n\nIn the spirit of this we may say that some propositions about the past\nare really (at any rate in part) about the future. And in these cases\nthey are not necessary. And we may then apply this to \u201cit was\ntrue in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\u201d\nThis, we may say, is (in part) really about 1/1/2100.\n\nPropositions which are in this way verbally about one time,\nt, but are really (in part) about a later time, are often\nsaid to express \u201csoft facts\u201d about t.\nUnfortunately it is not at all clear quite how the notion of a soft\nfact should be made precise. One might, for instance, say that if a\nproposition about t logically entails a proposition about a\nlater time, it expresses a soft fact about t. But if that is\nthe correct account, it seems that many propositions expressing soft\nfacts about the past will be necessary, even when they are partly\nabout the future. For instance, a proposition which conjoins some\nplausibly necessary proposition about the past with a law of nature to\nthe effect that in these circumstances something in the future will\nensue would seem to entail something about the future; but since it is\na conjunction of two plausibly necessary propositions, it seems to be\nnecessary itself.\n\nHowever it seems there is one variety of proposition which presumably\nexpresses a soft fact about the past, but is very plausibly not\nnecessary, namely a proposition which is equivalent to a conjunction\nwhere one of the conjuncts is plausibly wholly about the future, and\nwhere the other conjunct does not entail it. And, if the Aristotelian\nsolution is wrong, our example seems to fit this bill. The\nproposition, \u201cit was true in 1900 that there would be a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100\u201d is plausibly equivalent to \u201cthere\nwas such a time as 1900 and there will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\u201d And this proposition will not be necessary, if it is\nnot necessary that there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\n\nNotice that this does not show that the fatalist is wrong. It could\nstill be that the proposition that there will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100 is necessary. But it does seem to show that this\nargument does not show that fatalism is correct. The position seems to\nbe that, either the argument does not work, because the Aristotelian\nsolution is correct, or the argument does not work because, in the\nabsence of an independent reason to suppose that the proposition that\nthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 is necessary, we have no reason\nto suppose that the proposition, \u201cit was true in 1900 that there\nwould be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100\u201d is a necessary\nproposition.\n",
