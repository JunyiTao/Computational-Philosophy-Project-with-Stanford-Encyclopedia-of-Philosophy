    "main_text": "Philosophy || Dummett\n6.4 Finitism\n\nVarious forms of Finitism are based on a similar view as the\none expressed by Dummett, but in which the constructions that are\nallowed to prove mathematical statements are required to exist not\nonly in principle, but also in practice. Depending on the the precise\nimplementation of the latter notion one arrives at different forms of\nFinitism, such as the Ultra-Intuitionism developed by\nAlexander Yessenin-Volpin (1970) and the Strict Finitism\ndeveloped by Crispin Wright (1982).\n",
