Traditional philosophical\nmethods of conceptual or linguistic analysis can give us some\nguidance, indicating that some accounts offer a better fit with the\nordinary concept of happiness. Thus it has been argued that hedonism\nis false to the concept of happiness as we know it; the intuitions\ntaken to support hedonism point instead to an emotional state view\n(Haybron 2001). And some have argued that life\nsatisfaction is compatible with profoundly negative emotional states\nlike depression\u2014a suffering artist might not value emotional\nmatters much, and wholeheartedly affirm her life (Carson 1981, Davis\n1981b, Haybron 2005, Feldman 2010). Yet it might seem\ncounterintuitive to deem such a person happy. At the same time, people\ndo sometimes use \u2018happiness\u2019 to denote states of life\nsatisfaction: life satisfaction theories do seem faithful to some\nordinary uses of \u2018happiness\u2019. The trouble is that\nHAPPINESS appears to be a \u201cmongrel concept,\u201d as Ned Block\n(1995) called the concept of consciousness: the ordinary notion is\nsomething of a mess. We use the term to denote different things in\ndifferent contexts, and often have no clear notion of what we are\nreferring to. This suggests that accounts of happiness must be\nsomewhat revisionary, and that we must assess theories on grounds\nother than simple fidelity to the lay concept of\nhappiness\u2014\u201cdescriptive adequacy,\u201d in Sumner\u2019s\n(1996) terms. One candidate is practical utility: which conception of\nhappiness best answers to our interests in the notion? We talk about\nhappiness because we care about it. The question is why we care about\nit, and which psychological states within the extension of the\nordinary term make the most sense of this concern. Even if there is no\nsimple answer to the question what happiness is, it may well turn out\nthat our interests in happiness cluster so strongly around a\nparticular psychological kind that happiness can best, or most\nprofitably, be understood in terms of that type of state (Haybron\n2003). Alternatively, we may choose to distinguish different\nvarieties of happiness. It will be less important how we use the word,\nhowever, than that we be clear about the nature and significance of\nthe phenomena that interest us.\n",
