    "main_text": "Perfect Knowledge of Being Awake\n8. Perfect Knowledge of Being Awake\n\nBy design, the constructive arguments of the Meditations\nunfold even though the meditator remains in doubt about being awake.\nThis of course reinforces the ongoing theme that perfect knowledge\ndoes not properly encompass judgments of external sense. (The judgment\nthat an external material world exists is not strictly a judgment of\nexternal sense \u2013 as if knowing its existence simply by sensing\nit. Rather, as we\u2019ve seen, the judgment arises from an complex\ninference about the possible causes of sensations.) In the closing\nparagraph of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes revisits the issue of\ndreaming. He claims to show how, in principle \u2013 even if not\neasily in practice \u2013 it is possible to achieve perfect knowledge\nthat one is presently awake.\n\nA casual reading of that final paragraph might suggest that Descartes\noffers a naturalistic solution to the problem (i.e., a\nnon-theistic solution), in the form of a continuity test: since\ncontinuity with past experiences holds only of waking but not\ndreaming, checking for the requisite continuity provides a test for\nascertaining that one is awake. The following remarks can be read in\nthis way:\n\nI now notice that there is a vast difference between the two\n[\u201cbeing asleep and being awake\u201d], in that dreams are never\nlinked by memory with all the other actions of life as waking\nexperiences are. \u2026 But when I distinctly see where things come\nfrom and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my\nperceptions of them with the whole of the rest of my life without a\nbreak, then I am quite certain that when I encounter these things I am\nnot asleep but awake. (AT 7:89f, CSM 2:61f)\n\n\nThis naturalistic \u201csolution\u201d prompts two obvious\ncriticisms, both raised by Hobbes in the Third Objections. First, the\nsolution runs contrary to Descartes\u2019 No Atheistic Perfect\nKnowledge Thesis: since the continuity test (on the naturalistic\nreading of it) does not invoke God, it thus appears, as Hobbes notes,\n\u201cthat someone can know he is awake without knowledge of\nthe true God\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Second, it seems that one\ncould dream the requisite continuity: one could \u201cdream\nthat his dream fits in with his ideas of a long series of past\nevents,\u201d thus undermining the credibility of the continuity test\n(AT 7:195, CSM 2:137).\n\nMirroring our discussion in\n Section 7.2,\n one kind of interpretation has Descartes relaxing his epistemic\nstandards. He\u2019s aware that the naturalistic solution does not\nstand up to methodic doubt, but he\u2019s not attempting to overcome\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt with perfect knowledge. A problem for this\ninterpretation is that it doesn\u2019t square with the following\nreply Descartes makes to Hobbes\u2019 first objection: \u201can\natheist can infer that he is awake on the basis of memory of his past\nlife\u201d (via the continuity test); but \u201che cannot know that\nthis criterion is sufficient to give him the certainty that he is not\nmistaken, if he does not know that he was created by a non-deceiving\nGod\u201d (Replies 3, AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Evidently,\nDescartes\u2019 solution is not supposed to be available to the\natheist. Taken at face value, this reply rules out a relaxed standards\ninterpretation; it indeed rules out any interpretation involving a\nnaturalistic solution to the problem of dreaming.\n\nOn closer inspection, the Sixth Meditation passage puts forward not a\nnaturalistic solution, but a theistic one. The meditator\nfinally concludes that he\u2019s awake because, as the passage\nexplicitly reads, \u201cGod is not a deceiver\u201d (AT 7:90, CSM\n2:62).\n\nHow does his argument go? Recall, in the proof of the external\nmaterial world\n (Section 7.2),\n that Descartes mysteriously invokes the following (divinely\nguaranteed) truth rule:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThe dreaming passage looks to have Descartes again invoking this rule.\nThe passage opens with the meditator observing the following:\n\nI can almost always make use of more than one sense to investigate the\nsame thing; and in addition, I can use both my memory, which connects\npresent experiences with preceding ones, and my intellect, which has\nby now examined all the causes of error. Accordingly, I should not\nhave any further fears about the falsity of what my senses tell me\nevery day; on the contrary, the exaggerated doubts of the last few\ndays should be dismissed as laughable. This applies especially to\n\u2026 my inability to distinguish between being asleep and being\nawake. (AT 7:89, CSM 2:61)\n\n\nReferring to the worry that he\u2019s presently dreaming as\nexaggerated suggests that condition (i) is met \u2013 i.e.,\nsuggesting that the present circumstance includes a \u201cnatural\npropensity\u201d to believe he\u2019s awake. As such, he needs only\nto establish condition (ii), and he\u2019ll have a divine guarantee\nof being awake. Here, notice that an important theme of the above\npassage concerns the meditator\u2019s faculties for correcting\nsensory error \u2013 a theme suggestive of condition (ii). In\ncontext, Descartes\u2019 appeal to the continuity test is perhaps\nbest understood in conjunction with condition (ii). As the meditator\nsays (speaking of his apparently waking experience):\n\n[W]hen I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they\ncome to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with the\nwhole of the rest of my life without a break, then I am quite certain\nthat when I encounter these things I am not asleep but awake. And I\nought not to have even the slightest doubt of their reality if,\nafter calling upon all the senses as well as my memory and my\nintellect in order to check them, I receive no conflicting reports\nfrom any of these sources. For from the fact that God is not\na deceiver it follows that in cases like these I am\ncompletely free from error. (AT 7:90, CSM 2:62; italics added)\n\n\nCentral to the inference is the meditator\u2019s effort to check the\ncorrectness of his belief, by means of his various faculties. The\ncases like these to which Descartes refers look to be those\nwhere conditions (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. Recall what\nDescartes writes in conjunction with the proof of the external\nmaterial world: from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a\ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there\nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some\nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Perhaps,\ntherefore, we can understand Descartes\u2019 theistic solution to the\nNow Dreaming Doubt as building on the same rule he employs in\nhis proof for the external material world.\n\nWhat about Hobbes\u2019s other objection \u2013 in effect, that one\ncould dream both (i) and (ii)? Descartes\u2019 response:\n\u201cA dreamer cannot really connect his dreams with the ideas of\npast events, though he may dream that he does. For everyone admits\nthat a man may be deceived in his sleep\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137).\nPerhaps Descartes thinks the situation with dreaming parallels that of\nwaking life: those who are sufficiently tired, or otherwise\nperceptually inattentive, \u201ccannot really\u201d perceive truths\nclearly and distinctly, though it may seem to them that they\ndo. Whether in waking or dreaming, the Fourth Meditation theodicy has\nGod allowing us to make judgment errors, provided that they are\ncorrectable. Descartes is committed to holding that when our\nperception is confused, we can in principle come to discover the\nconfusion \u2013 even if not easily. When we lack clear and distinct\nperception, we are at fault (not God) for any resulting judgments, in\npart because we can discover that our perception is confused.\nDescartes needs it that the same principle holds even while dreaming.\n(And again, nearly the entirety of the Meditations unfolds\nunder the supposition that, for all we know, we may presently be\ndreaming.) For the case at hand \u2013 i.e., the possibility of\nmistakenly judging that I\u2019m awake, while in a dream\n\u2013 Descartes needs it that we could, in principle, discover that\nwe\u2019re mistaken. Apropos of condition (ii), therefore, is whether\nGod has provided us a faculty by which to discover that we\u2019re\ndreaming, on occasions when we wrongly believe ourselves to be awake.\nEvidently, Descartes thinks so, as he tells Gassendi:\n\nWhen, for example, we are asleep and are aware that we are dreaming,\nwe need imagination in order to dream, but to be aware that we are\ndreaming we need only the intellect. (Replies 5, AT 7:358f, CSM 2:248)\n\n\nImportantly, Descartes does not say we can easily correct the\nmistake of dreaming that we\u2019re awake. To the contrary,\nthe Sixth Meditation treatment of the Now Dreaming Doubt closes with a\nconcession that his solution is perhaps more theoretical than\npractical:\n\nBut since the pressure of things to be done does not always allow us\nto stop and make such a meticulous check, it must be admitted that in\nthis human life we are often liable to make mistakes about particular\nthings, and we must acknowledge the weakness of our nature. (AT 7:90,\nCSM 2:62)\n\n\nThus the importance of Descartes\u2019 First Meditation remark that\n\u201cno danger or error will result\u201d from the program of\nmethodical doubt, \u201cbecause the task now in hand does not involve\naction\u201d (AT 7:22, CSM 2:15). Methodical doubt should not be\napplied to practical matters. Prudence dictates that when making\npractical decisions I should assume I\u2019m awake, even if I\ndon\u2019t perfectly know that I\u2019m awake. Judgment errors made\nwhile mistakenly assuming I\u2019m awake do not have\nactual practical consequences, unlike those made while mistakenly\nassuming I\u2019m dreaming.\n\n(For further discussion, see Newman 1999, Williams 1978, and\nWilson 1978.)\n",
