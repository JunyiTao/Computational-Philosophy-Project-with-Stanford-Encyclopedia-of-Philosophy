    "main_text": "\n\n\nPascal did not publish any philosophical works during his relatively\nbrief lifetime. His status in French literature today is based\nprimarily on the posthumous publication of a notebook in which he\ndrafted or recorded ideas for a planned defence of Christianity, the\nPens\u00e9es de M. Pascal sur la religion et sur quelques autres\nsujets (1670). Nonetheless, his philosophical commitments can be gleaned from\nhis contributions to scientific and theological debates in\nFrance in the mid-seventeenth century.\n",
