    "main_text": "The Andersonian-Kangerian-Leibnizian Reduction || Syntax\n3.1 Syntax\n\nAssume that we have a language of classical modal propositional logic,\nwith a distinguished (deontic) propositional constant:\n\n\n\u201c\\(d\\)\u201d for \u201call (relevant) normative demands are\nmet\u201d.\n\n\nNow consider the following axiom system, \u201cKd\u201d:\n\n\nKd:\nAll Tautologies\n(TAUT) \n\n\u00a0\n\\(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow(\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box\nq)\\)\n(K) \n\n\u00a0\n\\(\\Diamond d\\)\n\\((\\Diamond d)\\) \n\n\u00a0\nIf \\(\\vdash p\\) and \\(\\vdash p \\rightarrow q\\) then \\(\\vdash\nq\\)\n(MP) \n\n\u00a0\nIf \\(\\vdash p\\) then \\(\\vdash \\Box p\\)\n(NEC) \n\n\nKd is just the normal modal logic K with \\(\\Diamond d\\)\n added.[34]\n \\(\\Diamond d\\) is interpreted as telling us that it is possible that\nall normative demands are met. In import when added to system K, it is\nsimilar to (though stronger than) the \u201cNo Conflicts\u201d axiom\nof SDL. All of the Traditional Scheme\u2019s deontic\noperators are easily defined derivatively once we provide \u201cthe\nreductive clause\u201d for \\(\\OB\\): \n\n\\[\\OB p \\eqdf \\Box(d \\rightarrow p)\\]\n\n\nSo in Kd, \\(p\\) is obligatory if \\(p\\) is necessitated\nby all normative demands being met, permissible if \\(p\\) is\ncompatible with all normative demands being met,\nimpermissible if \\(p\\) is incompatible with all normative\ndemands, etc. Since none of the operators of the Traditional Scheme\nare taken as primitive, and the basic logic is a modal logic with\nnecessity and possibility as the primitive modal operators, this is\nreferred to as \u201ca reduction\u201d (of deontic logic to modal\nlogic)\n\nProofs of SDL-ish formulas are then just K-proofs of the corresponding\nmodal formulae involving\n \u201c\\(d\\)\u201d.[35]\n It is well-known that all theorems of SDL are derivable in Kd\nand conversely, that if some formula in the language of SDL is not a\ntheorem of SDL, then its translation following the Kangerian reduction\nis also not a theorem of\n Kd.[36]\n In addition to containing all theorems of SDL, we note a few theorems\nthat are specific to Kd because of the non-overlapping\nsyntactic ingredients, \\(d, \\Box\\), and \\(\\Diamond\\):\n\n\n\\(\\vdash \\OB d \\)\n\\((\\OB d)\\) \n\n\\(\\vdash \\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow(\\OB p \\rightarrow \\OB\nq)\\)\n(RM\u2019) \n\n\\(\\vdash \\Box p \\rightarrow \\OB p\\)\n(Nec\u2019) \n\n\\(\\vdash \\OB p \\rightarrow \\Diamond p\\)\n(\u201cKant\u2019s\n Law\u201d)[37]\n\n\n\\(\\vdash \\neg \\Diamond(\\OB p \\amp \\OB \\neg p)\\)\n(NC\u2019) \n\n\nThese are easily\n derived.[38]\n\nAlthough our underlying modal system is just K, adding further\nnon-deontic axiom schema (i.e., those that cannot be abbreviated via\nSDL formulas, nor involving \\(d\\) specifically) can nonetheless have a\ndeontic impact. To illustrate, suppose we added a fourth axiom, one to\nthe effect that necessity is truth-implicating, standardly called\naxiom \u201cT\u201d: \n\n\\[ \\Box p \\rightarrow p \\tag{T} \\]\n\n\nCall the system that results from adding this formula to our current\nsystem \u201cKTd\u201d. The addition of T makes derivable our\npreviously mentioned axiom \\(\\OB\\)-U of SDL+, which we have shown is\nnot derivable in SDL\n itself:[39]\n \n\n\\[ \\vdash \\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p) \\]\n\n\nSo, reflecting on the fact that SDL+ is derivable in KTd, we\nsee that the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction must either rely on a\nnon-truth-implicating conception of necessity in order for its pure\ndeontic fragment to match SDL, or SDL itself is not susceptible to the\nAndersonian-Kangerian reduction. Put another way, the most plausible\nversion of the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction can\u2019t help but\nview \u201cStandard Deontic Logic\u201d as too weak.\n\nAnderson\u2019s approach is practically equivalent to Kanger\u2019s.\nFirst, consider the fact that we can easily define another constant in\nKd, as follows: \n\n\\[ s \\eqdf \\neg d. \\]\n\n\nwhere this new constant would now be derivatively read as follows:\n\n\n\u201csome (relevant) normative demand has been violated\u201d.\n\n\nClearly our current axiom, \\(\\Diamond d\\), could be replaced with\n\\(\\neg \\Box s\\), asserting that it is not necessary that some\nnormative demand is violated. We could then define \\(\\OB\\) as:\n\n\\[ \\OB p \\eqdf \\Box(\\neg p \\rightarrow s). \\]\n\n\nEssentially, Anderson took this equivalent course with\n\u201c\\(s\\)\u201d being his primitive (initially standing for\nsomething like \u201cthe sanction has been invoked\u201d or\n\u201cthere is a liability to sanction\u201d), and \\(\\neg \\Box s\\),\nas the axiom added to some modal system (e.g., at least as strong as\nmodal system KT).\n\nWe should also note that Anderson was famous as a founding figure in\n relevance logic,\n and along with using strict implication, \\(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q)\\),\nhe also explored the use of a relevant (and thus neither material nor\nstrict) form of implication, \\(\\Rightarrow\\), to express the reduction\nas: \\(\\OB p \\eqdf \\neg p \\Rightarrow\n s\\).[40]\n (A bit more on this can be found within the entry on\n Mally\u2019s deontic logic.\n See further references there.) This alternative reflects the fact\nthat there is an issue in both Kanger\u2019s and Anderson\u2019s\nstrict necessitation (or entailment) approaches of just what notion of\n\u201cnecessity\u201d is involved in claiming that meetings all\nnormative demands (or avoiding the sanction) in some sense\nnecessitates \\(p\\).\n\nAs a substantive matter, how should we think of these\n\u201creductions\u201d? For example, should we view them as giving\nus an analysis of what it is for something to be obligatory?\nTaking Kanger's approach first, it would seem that \\(d\\) must be read\nas a distinctive deontic ingredient, if we are to get the derivative\ndeontic reading for the \u201creduced\u201d deontic operators. Also,\nas our reading suggests, it is not clear that \\(d\\) does not, at least\nby intention, express a complex quantificational notion involving the\nvery concept of obligation (demand) as a proper part, namely that all\nobligations have been fulfilled, so that the \u201creduction\u201d,\npresented as an analysis, would appear to be circular. If we\nread \\(d\\) instead as \u201cideal circumstances obtain\u201d, the\nclaim of a substantive reduction or analysis appears more promising,\nuntil we ask: Are the circumstances ideal only with respect to meeting\nnormative demands or obligations, or are they ideal in other\n(for example supererogatory) ways that go beyond merely satisfying\nnormative demands? Anderson\u2019s \u201cliability to\nsanction\u201d approach may appear more promising, since the idea\nthat something is obligatory if (and only if) and because\nnon-compliance necessitates (in some sense) liability to (or perhaps\ndesert of) punishment does not appear to be circular (unless the\nnotion of \u201cliability\u201d itself ultimately involves the idea\nof permissibility of punishment), but is it plausible? Alternatively,\nperhaps a norm that is merely an ideal cannot be\nviolated, in which case perhaps norms that have been\nviolated can be distinguished (as a subset) from norms that\nhave not been complied with, and then the notion of an\nobligation as something that must obtain unless some norm is violated\nwill not be obviously circular. There is a substantive philosophical\nquestion lingering here that the language of a \u201creduction\u201d\nbrings naturally to the surface, but is sloughed over. The formal\nutility of the reduction does not hinge on this, but its philosophical\nsignificance does.\n",
