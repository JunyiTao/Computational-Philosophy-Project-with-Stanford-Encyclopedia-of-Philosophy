    "main_text": "The Morality of Procreation || Enhancement\n3.4 Enhancement\n\nSome couples who undergo IVF also opt for preimplantation genetic\ndiagnosis (PGD) whereby the genomes of their embryos are analyzed and\nparticular embryos then selected for implantation. This is more common\namong couples at risk for transmitting a genetic disease or who are\ntrying to create a child compatible with an existing ill child so that\nshe can be used as a source of donated stem cells. However, it can be\nused for selecting for or against other traits, such as sex, or\ndisability\u2014for example, some deaf parents want to raise children\nwho inherit their deafness. Such uses of PGD are controversial (on sex\nselection see Heyd 2003; Robertson 2003; Purdy 2007; ESHRE Task Force\n2013; on selecting deafness see Karpin 2007; Fahmy 2011; Schroeder\n2018).\n\nCurrent technology is mostly limited to selecting among existing\nembryos. However, the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing\ntechniques has finally made it possible to genetically alter gametes\nand embryos in vivo. This has made questions about the permissibility\nof genetic enhancement pressing.\n\nSeveral critics of genetic enhancement argue that permitting\nenhancement is liable to undermine important human values. Sandel\nargues that the control that enhancement technology would allow\nparents is liable to undermine their humility in the face of the gift\nof their children, impose responsibilities that we are not prepared to\ndeal with, and threaten social solidarity (Sandel 2007). Habermas\nargues that parents who genetically enhance their children will,\nthrough the control they exert, prevent their children from entering\nrelationships of moral equality and undermine their ability to be\nautonomous (Habermas 2003). Both have been criticized for exaggerating\nthe likely effects of permitting enhancement technologies (Fenton\n2006; Lev 2011).\n\nA second argument against permitting parents to genetically enhance\ntheir offspring is that it is liable to exacerbate unfairness.\nEnhancements will probably be available only to richer parents. As a\nresult, their offspring, who are already advantaged over their peers,\nwould be even better able to compete against them (Etieyibo 2012).This\nis commonly raised as a particular objection to genetic (or other\nbiomedical) enhancements, but it is not clear why there is something\ndistinctive about genetic enhancement that renders it more troubling\nthan other ways in which parents attempt to enhance their children,\nsuch as private schooling.\n\nThe fairness objection also assumes that the advantages of genetic\nenhancement are competitive advantages, so that an enhancement would\nmake the recipient better able to compete with others for goods such\nas careers and social status. This assumption underlies concerns both\nthat the availability of enhancements would exacerbate existing\ninequalities and that if universally available they would be\ncollectively self-defeating (as, for example, if everyone were to add\n6 inches to their height) (Glannon 2001). However, this assumption\nmight be false; for example, literacy is a non-genetic enhancement\nwhich is beneficial both to the literate person and others (Buchanan\n2008).\n\nWhile most discussions of the ethics of genetic enhancement have\nfocused on whether the practice is ever permissible, some ethicists\nargue that it is not only permissible for parents to enhance their\nchildren, but a positive duty. Savulescu (2001) argues for what he\ncalls the Principle of Procreative Beneficence: couples should use\npre-genetic diagnosis and selective abortion to choose the child, of\nthe children they could have, who will have the best life. This\nnaturally extends to using genetic enhancement. Savulescu\u2019s\njustification for the principle of Procreative Beneficence is that it\nseems irrational not to select the best child when no other reasons\nare relevant to one\u2019s choice. But this seems like a very weak\nprinciple: it seems likely that at least some other reason will\nfrequently apply. For example, prospective parents might just prefer\nto leave their child\u2019s genetic makeup up to chance. If this is\nnot an irrational preference, then it plausibly gives some reason for\nthem not to select any particular embryo to implant. Savulescu\u2019s\nview is extended in further papers which claim that the principle of\nProcreative Beneficence has greater moral weight than simply being a\ntiebreaker when no other reasons apply (Savulescu and Kahane 2009,\n281; for criticism see Parker 2010, Carter and Gordon 2013, Bennett\n2014). These and related issues are discussed at length in the entries\non\n enhancement and\n eugenics.\n\nFinally, controversy is not limited to genetic interventions: there\nare live debates about whether parents may choose (male) circumcision,\nclitoridectomy, marrow donation, sex assignment of inter-sexed\nchildren, and other surgical interventions (see, e.g., Benatar and\nBenatar 2003 on circumcision; Parens 2006, on surgically shaping\nchildren).\n",
