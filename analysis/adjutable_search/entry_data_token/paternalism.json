Introduction\n\nThe government requires people to contribute to a pension system\n(Social Security). It requires motorcyclists to wear helmets. It\nforbids people from swimming at a public beach when lifeguards are not\npresent. It forbids the sale of various drugs deemed to be\nineffective. It forbids the sale of various drugs believed to be\nharmful. It does not allow consent to certain forms of assault to be a\ndefense against prosecution for that assault.\n\nThe civil law does not allow the enforcement of certain kinds of\ncontracts, e.g., for gambling debts. It requires minors to have blood\ntransfusions even if their religious beliefs forbid it. Persons may be\ncivilly committed if they are a danger to themselves.\n\nDoctors do not tell their patients the truth about their medical\ncondition. A physician may tell the wife of a man whose car went off a\nbridge into the water and drowned that he died instantly when in fact\nhe died a rather ghastly death.\n\nA husband may hide the sleeping pills from a depressed wife. A\nphilosophy department may require a student to take logic courses.\n\nA teacher may be less than honest about telling a student that he has\nlittle philosophical ability.\n\nAll of these rules, policies, and actions may be done for various\nreasons; may be justified by various considerations. When they are\njustified solely on the grounds that the person affected would be\nbetter off, or would be less harmed, as a result of the rule, policy,\netc., and the person in question would prefer not to be treated this\nway, we have an instance of paternalism.\n\nAs the examples indicate the question of paternalism is one that\narises in many different areas of our personal and public life. As\nsuch, it is an important realm of applied ethics. But it also raises\ncertain theoretical issues. Perhaps the most important is: what powers\nit is legitimate for a state, operating both coercively and in terms\nof incentives, to possess? It also raises questions about the proper\nways in which individuals, either in an institutional or purely\npersonal setting, should relate to one another. How should we think\nabout individual autonomy and its limits? What is it to respect the\npersonhood of others? What is the trade-off, if any, between regard\nfor the welfare of another and respect for their right to make their\nown decisions?\n\nThis entry examines some of the conceptual issues involved in\nanalyzing paternalism, and then discusses the normative issues\nconcerning the legitimacy of paternalism by the state and various\ncivil institutions.\n2. Conceptual Issues\n\nThe analysis of paternalism involves at least the following elements.\nIt involves some kind of limitation on the freedom or autonomy of some\nagent and it does so for a particular class of reasons. As with many\nother concepts used in normative debate determining the exact\nboundaries of the concept is a contested issue. \n\nAnd as often is the case the first question is whether the concept\nitself is normative or descriptive. Is application of the concept a\nmatter for empirical determination, so that if two people disagree\nabout the application to a particular case they are disagreeing about\nsome matter of fact or of definition? Or does their disagreement\nreflect different views about the legitimacy of the application in\nquestion?\n\nWhile it is clear that for some to characterize a policy as\npaternalistic is to condemn or criticize it, that does not establish\nthat the term itself is an evaluative one. As a matter of methodology\nit is preferable to see if some concept can be defined in\nnon-normative terms and only if that fails to capture the relevant\nphenomena to accept a normative definition.\n\nI suggest the following conditions as an analysis of X acts\npaternalistically towards Y by doing (omitting)\nZ:\n\nZ (or its omission) interferes with the liberty or autonomy\nof Y.\nX does so without the consent of Y.\nX does so only because X believes Z will\nimprove the welfare of Y (where this includes preventing his\nwelfare from diminishing), or in some way promote the interests,\nvalues, or good of Y.\n\n\nCondition one is the trickiest to capture. Clear cases include\nthreatening bodily compulsion, lying, withholding information that the\nperson has a right to have, or imposing requirements or conditions.\nBut what about the following case? A father, skeptical about the\nfinancial acumen of a child, instead of bequeathing the money\ndirectly, gives it to another child with instructions to use it in the\nbest interests of the first child. The first child has no legal claim\non the inheritance. There does not seem to be an interference with the\nchild\u2019s liberty nor on most conceptions the child\u2019s\nautonomy.\n\nOr consider the case of a wife who hides her sleeping pills so that\nher potentially suicidal husband cannot use them. Her act may satisfy\nthe second and third conditions but what about the first? Does her\naction limit the liberty or autonomy of her husband?\n\nThe second condition is supposed to be read as distinct from acting\nagainst the consent of an agent. The agent may neither consent nor not\nconsent. He may, for example, be unaware of what is being done to him.\nThere is also the distinct issue of whether one acts not knowing about\nthe consent of the person in question. Perhaps the person in fact\nconsents but this is not known to the paternaliser.\n\nThe third condition also can be complicated. There may be more than\none reason for interfering with Y. In addition to concern for\nthe welfare of Y there may be concern for how Y\u2019s\nactions may affect third-parties. Is the \u201cjust for\u201d\ncondition too strong? Or what about the case where a legislature\npasses a legal rule for paternalistic reasons but there are sufficient\nnon-paternalistic reasons to justify passage of the rule? \n\nIf, in order to decide on any of the above issues, one must decide a\nnormative issue, e.g., does someone have a right to some information,\nthen the concept is not purely descriptive. Ultimately the question of\nhow to refine the conditions, and what conditions to use, is a matter\nfor philosophical judgment. The term \u201cpaternalism\u201d as used\nin ordinary contexts may be too amorphous for thinking about\nparticular normative issues. One should decide upon an analysis based\non a hypothesis of what will be most useful for thinking about a\nparticular range of problems. One might adopt one analysis in the\ncontext of doctors and patients and another in the context of whether\nthe state should ban unhealthy foods. \n\nGiven some particular analysis of paternalism there will be various\nnormative views about when paternalism is justified. The following\nterminology is useful.\n2.1 Hard vs. soft paternalism\n\nSoft paternalism is the view that the only conditions under which\nstate paternalism is justified is when it is necessary to determine\nwhether the person being interfered with is acting voluntarily and\nknowledgeably. To use Mill\u2019s famous example of the person about\nto walk across a damaged bridge, if we could not communicate the\ndanger (he speaks only Japanese) a soft paternalist would justify\nforcibly preventing him from crossing the bridge in order to determine\nwhether he knows about its condition. If he knows, and wants to, say,\ncommit suicide he must be allowed to proceed. A hard paternalist says\nthat, at least sometimes, it may be permissible to prevent him from\ncrossing the bridge even if he knows of its condition. We are entitled\nto prevent voluntary suicide.\n2.2 Broad vs. narrow paternalism\n\nA narrow paternalist is only concerned with the question of state\ncoercion, i.e., the use of legal coercion. A broad paternalist is\nconcerned with any paternalistic action: state, institutional\n(hospital policy), or individual.\n2.3 Weak vs. strong paternalism\n\nA weak paternalist believes that it is legitimate to interfere with\nthe means that agents choose to achieve their ends, if those means are\nlikely to defeat those ends. So if a person really prefers safety to\nconvenience then it is legitimate to force them to wear seatbelts. A\nstrong paternalist believes that people may have mistaken, confused or\nirrational ends and it is legitimate to interfere to prevent them from\nachieving those ends. If a person really prefers the wind rustling\nthrough their hair to increased safety it is legitimate to make them\nwear helmets while motorcycling because their ends are irrational or\nmistaken. If one is a weak but not a strong paternalist we may\nonly interfere with mistakes about the facts not with mistakes about\nvalues. So if a person tries to jump out of a window believing he will\nfloat gently to the ground we may restrain him. If he jumps because he\nbelieves that it is important to be spontaneous we may not.\n2.4 Pure vs. impure paternalism\n\nSuppose we prevent persons from manufacturing cigarettes because we\nbelieve they are harmful to consumers. The group we are trying to\nprotect is the group of consumers not manufacturers (who may not be\nsmokers at all). Our reason for interfering with the manufacturer is\nthat he is causing harm to others. Nevertheless the basic\njustification is paternalist because the consumer consents (assuming\nthe relevant information is available to him) to the harm. It is not\nlike the case where we prevent manufacturers from polluting the air.\nIn pure paternalism the class being protected is identical with the\nclass being interfered with, e.g., preventing swimmers from swimming\nwhen lifeguards are not present. In the case of impure paternalism the\nclass of persons interfered with is larger than the class being\nprotected.\n2.5 Moral vs. welfare paternalism\n\nThe usual justification for paternalism refers to the interests of the\nperson being interfered with. These interests are defined in terms of\nthe things that make a person\u2019s life go better; in particular\ntheir physical and psychological condition. It is things like death or\nmisery or painful emotional states which are in question. Sometimes,\nhowever, advocates of state intervention seek to protect the moral\nwelfare of the person. So, for example, it may be argued that\nprostitutes are better off being prevented from plying their trade\neven if they make a decent living and their health is protected\nagainst disease. They are better off because it is morally corrupting\nto sell one\u2019s sexual services. The interference is justified,\ntherefore, to promote the moral well-being of the person. This then\ncan be called moral paternalism. Still another distinction within\nmoral paternalism is between interferences to improve a person\u2019s\nmoral character, and hence her well-being, and interferences to make\nsomeone a better person\u2014even if her life does not go better for\nher as a result. \n\nFinally, it is important to distinguish paternalism, whether welfare\nor moral, from other ideas used to justify interference with persons;\neven cases where the interference is not justified in terms of\nprotecting or promoting the interests of others. In particular moral\npaternalism should be distinguished from legal moralism, i.e., the\nidea that certain ways of acting are morally wrong or degrading and\nmay be prohibited. So, for example, the barroom \u201csport\u201d of\ndwarf tossing (where dwarfs who are paid, and are protected with\nhelmets, etc. participate in contests to see who can throw them\nfurthest) might be thought to be legitimately prohibited. Not because\nthe dwarf is injured in any way, not because the dwarf corrupts\nhimself by agreeing to participate in such activities, but simply\nbecause the activity is wrong.\n\nTo be sure it is not always easy to distinguish between legal moralism\nand moral paternalism. If one believes, as Plato does, that acting\nwrongly damages the soul of the agent, then it will be possible to\ninvoke moral paternalism rather than legal moralism. What is important\nis that there are two distinct justifications that are possible; one\nappealing to the mere immorality of the conduct interfered with, the\nother to the harm done to the agent\u2019s character.\n3. Normative Issues\n\nIs there a burden of proof attached to paternalism? Does the\npaternalist or anti-paternalist have to give a reason for their\naction? As we have seen the analysis of paternalism seems to cut both\nways. It is an interference with liberty which might be thought to\nplace the burden of proof on the paternalist. It is an act intended to\nproduce good for the agent which might be thought to place the burden\nof proof on those who object to paternalism. It might be thought, as\nMill did, that the burden of proof is different depending on who is\nbeing treated paternalistically. If it is a child then the assumption\nis that, other things being equal, the burden of proof is on those who\nresist paternalism. If it is an adult of sound mind the presumption is\nreversed.\n\nSuppose we start from the presumption that paternalism is wrong. The\nquestion becomes under what, if any, circumstances, can the\npresumption be overcome? The possible answers are \u201cunder no\ncircumstances\u201d, \u201cunder some circumstances\u201d, and\n\u201cunder any circumstances\u201d\n\nThe last seems very implausible. Essentially it is the view that the\nfact that an act is (intended to be) beneficial for a person, and does\nnot affect or violate the interests of others, settles the question of\nwhether it may be done. Only a view which ignores the means by which\ngood is promoted, and the ethical status of such means, can hold this.\nAny sensible view has to distinguish between good done to agents at\ntheir request or with their consent, and good thrust upon them against\ntheir will.\n\nSo the normative options seem to be just two. Either we are never\npermitted to aim at doing good for others against their wishes, and in\nways which limit their liberty, or we are permitted to do so.\n\nWhy might one think that at least the state may never do so? One might\nthink so because of various beliefs about the impossibility of in fact\ndoing good for people against their will or because one thinks that\nalthough possible to do good it is in fact inconsistent with some\nnormative standard which ought to prevail.\n\nWith respect to the impossibility question one might believe either\nthat it is not possible to do any good by acting paternalistically or\nthat although it is possible to do some good the process will (almost)\nalways produce bads which outweigh the good.\n\nIf one thought that (almost) always more harm than good is done by the\nstate when it acts paternalistically this raises the question of\nwhether we can distinguish the conditions in which (rarely) more good\nthan harm is done and build that into our guidelines. If this is\npossible, and allowing paternalism in these exceptional cases does not\ncreate further harms which outweigh the good produced, then we should\nsometimes be paternalists. If it is impossible to distinguish the\n\u201cgood\u201d from the \u201cbad\u201d cases then, at least if\nwe are rule consequentialists, we ought not to have such a rule; and\nwe ought not to try and make the distinctions on a case by case\nbasis.\n\nBut one might believe that the question of whether more good than harm\nis produced is not simply an empirical one. It depends on our\nunderstanding of the good of persons. If the good simply included\nitems such as longer life, greater health, more income, or less\ndepression, then it makes it look like an empirical issue. But if we\nconceive of the good of individuals as including items such as being\nrespected as an independent agent, having a right to make decisions\nfor oneself, or having one\u2019s autonomy not infringed, then the\nissue of whether the agent is better off after being paternalised is\npartly a normative matter. One might believe that one cannot make\npeople better off by infringing their autonomy in the same way that\nsome people believe one cannot make a person better off by putting\nthem in a Nozickian experience machine (one in which they are floating\nin a tank but seem to be having all kinds of wonderful experiences).\nCompare Mill\u2019s statement that \u201c\u2026a man\u2019s mode\nof laying out his own existence is best not because it is the best in\nitself, but because it is his own mode\u2026\u201d (1859: Chapter\nIII).\n\nKantian views are frequently absolutistic in their objections to\npaternalism. On these views we must always respect the rational agency\nof other persons. To deny an adult the right to make their own\ndecisions, however mistaken from some standpoint they are, is to treat\nthem as simply means to their own good, rather than as ends in\nthemselves. In a way anti-paternalism is already incorporated into\nKantian theories by their prohibition against lying and\nforce\u2014the main instruments of paternalistic interference. Since\nthese instrumentalities are already denied even to prevent individuals\nfrom harming others, they will certainly be forbidden to prevent them\nfrom harming themselves. Of course, one may object to the former\nabsolutism while accepting the latter.\n\nIf one believes that sometimes paternalism is justifiable one may do\nso for various kinds of theoretical reasons. The broadest is simply\nconsequentialist, i.e., more good than harm is produced. A narrower\njustification is that sometimes the individual\u2019s (long-run)\nautonomy is advanced by restricting his autonomy (short-run). So one\nmight prevent people from taking mind-destroying drugs on the grounds\nthat allowing them to do so destroys their autonomy and preventing\nthem from doing so preserves it. This is essentially Mill\u2019s\nargument against allowing people to contract into slavery. Note that\nif the theory of the good associated with a particular\nconsequentialism is broad enough, i.e., includes autonomy as one of\nthe goods, it can be equivalent to the autonomy theory (assuming that\nthe structure of the autonomy view is a maximizing one).\n\nA different theoretical basis is (moral) contractualism. On this view\nif there are cases of justified paternalism they are justified on the\nbasis that we (all of us) would agree to such interference, given\nsuitable knowledge and suitable motivation. So, for instance, it might\nbe argued that since we know we are subject to depression we all would\nagree, at least, to short-term anti-suicide interventions, to\ndetermine whether we are suffering from such a condition, and to\nattempt to cure it. More generally, we might accept what Feinberg\ncalled \u201csoft paternalism.\u201d This is the view that when we\nare not acting fully voluntarily it is permissible to intervene to\nprovide information, or to point out defects in our rationality, but\nthat if we then do make a voluntary choice it must be respected. Or we\nmight agree to being forced to wear seat-belts knowing our disposition\nto discount future benefits for present ones. The justification here\nis neither consequentialist nor based simply on the preservation of\nautonomy. Rather either kind of consideration may be taken into\naccount, as well as others, in determining what we would reasonably\nagree to.\n4. Libertarian Paternalism\n\nIn recent years there has been a new, influential, strand of thought\nabout paternalistic interferences. It has been referred to as New\nPaternalism or Libertarian Paternalism. It is influenced by research\nin the behavioral sciences on the many ways in which our cognitive and\naffective capacities are flawed and limited.\n\nThe first theorists to emphasize these findings for making social\npolicy were the Nudgers\u2014Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler (2003).\nThey argued that since people were such bad decision makers we should\nnudge them in the direction of their own desired goals by\norchestrating their choices so that they are more likely to do what\nachieves their ends.\n\nThe claim is that, unlike traditional paternalism which rules out\nchoices by compulsion or adds costs to the choices by coercion, nudges\nsimply change the presentation of the choices in such a way that\npeople were more likely to choose options that are best for them. In\naddition they argue that any arrangement of choices will make some\nchoices more or less likely so that some decision about the choice\narchitecture is inevitable.\n\nThe first issue is what exactly distinguishes Nudges from other ways\nof influencing people\u2019s choices. Here are various examples of\nNudges. These were given in the earliest discussions of nudging and\nhave tended to be the ones focused on.\n\nCafeteria. In order to influence students to make healthier\nfood choices as they pass the cafeteria options place the healthy\nfoods at eye level and place the less healthy choices higher or lower\nthan eye level. Sometimes the nudge involves putting the healthful\nfood earlier in the line.\n\nOpt-In vs Opt-Out. Given that many employees often fail to\nenroll (opt-in) in retirement plans, employers make the default\nautomatic enrollment in such programs, allowing employees to easily\nopt-out. Such programs have been shown to increase savings rates.\n\nSave More Tomorrow. Employees are asked to commit now to\nhaving a portion of their salary increase in subsequent years put\ndirectly into their pension plan. People are loss averse, and thus\nmore willing to forgo a raise in take-home income than they are to\nactively re-direct the additional funds they have already received to\ntheir retirement accounts each year.\n\nSize of Plates. Using smaller plates in a cafeteria cuts down\non the amount of food consumed.\n\nPainting Traffic Lanes. In order to get drivers to slow down\non a sharp turn the lane lines are painted closer together than usual.\nThis creates the illusion for the drivers that they are driving faster\nthan they actually are and they slow down as a result.\n\nThe initial examples above served as the focus of much of the early\nliterature. The early critics attempted to distinguish interventions\nsuch as Cafeteria from interventions such as merely providing\ninformation. It is clear from more recent writings that the category\nof nudges is intended to be quite broad. According to Sunstein all the\nfollowing are nudges: reminders, warnings, a GPS, disclosure of the\ninterest rate of a bank card, any information about what people like\nyou do, simplification of government forms, default rules, subliminal\nmessages urging people to eat healthy food.\n\nThaler and Sunstein also provided a characterization of a nudge as\n\n\n\nany aspect of the choice architecture that alters people\u2019s\nbehavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or\nsignificantly changing their economic incentive. (2008: 6)\n\n4.1 Definitional issues\n\nWhy is the view labeled by its introducers as Libertarian Paternalism?\nIn the paradigmatic definitions of nudging the intervention is always\nby way of what is called \u201cchoice architecture.\u201d Choice\narchitecture is the design of different ways in which choices can be\npresented to an agent. Examples include the number of choices, whether\nthe choice is opt-in or opt-out, the way in which alternatives are\ndescribed or presented, the incentives attached to the choices,\netc.\n\nTheir view is Libertarian because it preserves freedom of choice. No\nchoice is eliminated or made more difficult. Nobody is coerced. The\nchoice set remains the same. No significant costs or incentives are\nattached to the choices the agent faces.\n\nTheir view is Paternalistic because it seeks to promote the good of\nthe agent being nudged. And it is the good as viewed by the agent\nherself. We are not nudging towards ends she does not hold. Nudging is\nabout means not ends.\n\nTheir definition of Paternalism is very weak in the sense that it\nallows many more acts to count as paternalistic than would be under\nalmost all traditional definitions of paternalism.\n\nIn terms of the analysis of Paternalism given in this entry is Nudging\npaternalistic? The first condition in the definition is: the action\n(or its omission) interferes with the liberty or autonomy of Y.\nNothing corresponds to this in the definition above. Putting a warning\nlabel on a cigarette pack does not interfere with the liberty of\nautonomy of any cigarette smoker.\n\nBasically, the definition of paternalism in Libertarian Paternalism is\nfocused solely on the fact that nudges are being used to make the\nagents being nudged better off. We could replace\n\u201cpaternalism\u201d with \u201cbenevolence\u201d and nothing\nimportant would be left out since the \u201clibertarian\u201d aspect\npicks up everything else that is significant. Whether this expansion\nof the definition of paternalism is warranted or not is a matter of\nwhat issues are being explored and whether such an expansion makes\nthings clearer or more confused.\n\nThere are nudges which are not paternalistic ( on their definition)\nbecause the aim is to promote the general good\u2014even if the\nchooser is not benefitted. Nudging building managers to put in\nelevators with braille buttons, influencing people to contribute to\nOxfam by putting up pictures of starving infants, are examples where\nthe good to be promoted is the welfare of people other than those\nbeing influenced.\n\nHowever one comes out on the issue of whether the definition of\npaternalism is useful or not we turn to the more important issues\nabout whether, and in what circumstances, nudges are justifiable ways\nof influencing persons to make certain choices.\n4.2 Normative Issues\n\nGiven that nudges are not coercive, that they are intended to promote\nthe good of individuals as they themselves perceive that good, that\nthey have been shown to often be effective, are there any plausible\nnormative objections to their use?\n\nAs with any policy intervention, either by the state or by private\norganizations, there are possible misuses to worry about. Perhaps\nthere are slippery-slopes to be avoided. Perhaps proponents of nudging\nover-estimate the amount and seriousness of faulty reasoning by\nagents; mistakes that nudgers wish to harness to promote the agents\nwelfare. Perhaps they are mistaken about what agents really value when\nthey claim people prefer health to more sugary beverages.\n\nBut these objections are not objections to nudging but to the misuse\nof this type of behavioral intervention. Are there objections to the\nvery nature of nudging itself?\n\nThere is one feature of many nudges that must be considered which,\nalthough not intrinsic to the concept of a nudge, is often present in\nthe background as a crucial feature. One author actually links these\nbackground conditions to the definition of Libertarian\nPaternalism.\n\n\nLibertarian Paternalism is the set of interventions aimed at\novercoming the unavoidable cognitive biases and decisional\ninadequacies of an individual by exploiting them in such a way as to\ninfluence her decisions (in an easily reversible manner) towards the\nchoices she herself would make under idealised conditions. (Rebanato\n2012: 6) \n\n\nAn example of this use of cognitive biases is changing opt-in to\nopt-out. It is because of cognitive bias to doing nothing to change\nthe status quo that there are relatively fewer opt-outs than might be\nexpected.\n\nGiven this background, there are at least three objections that have\nobjected to features intrinsic to some\u2014by no means\nall\u2014nudges. The first is that nudging often occurs without the\nnudged being aware they are being nudged. The second is that nudging\noften works by harnessing defects in the thinking of those being\nnudged. The third is that some nudges (besides those subject to the\nfirst two objections) are forms of objectionable manipulation.\n4.3 Transparency\n\nOne issue with many nudges is what the person being nudged knows about\nthe nudge. In the Cafeteria example the students are aware that food\nhas been placed at different levels of eyesight. In that sense the\nnudge is transparent to them. It is not like subliminal messaging in\nwhich they are not aware of messages directed to them. Let us call\nnudges which are transparent in this sense narrow nudges.\n\nFor an example of a nudge that is not even narrowly transparent\nconsider the experiment where, in order to increase office\nworker\u2019s payments for the coffee they take from the coffee\nmachine a painting of a pair of eyes is hung above the coffee pot.\nThis did increase the rate of payment. Most workers questioned about\nthe painting either had not noticed it at all or made no connection\nwith the issue of payment.\n\nIn the cafeteria example while aware that the food is on different\nlevels the students are not aware that the placing of the food has\nbeen done in order to promote a certain end\u2014eating more healthy\nfoods. The placement of the food is not random, nor motivated by\naesthetic considerations. It is deliberate and motivated by a\nparticular set of considerations. Some nudges are more transparent in\nthe sense that it is obvious they have been deliberately introduced\nand their motivation is also clear. For example, the warnings on\ncigarette packages that smoking is dangerous to one\u2019s health.\nCall these broad nudges.\n\nThere is some evidence that making nudges broad does not interfere\nwith their efficacy. A recent study in the context of end-of-life care\nshowed the effect of a default is not weakened when people are told\nthat a default was chosen because it is usually effective (Lowenstein\net al. 2014).\n\nNote that there could be an even more transparent feature of\nnudges\u2014call them very broad nudges. This would be when the\nmechanism by which the nudge influences is made public as well.\nSuppose we presented an opt-out set up and said (1) we are doing this\nto increase participation in the retirement program, and (2) if this\nis effective it is because people have a tendency to stick with the\nstatus-quo.\n\nNudges which are neither narrow nor broad\u2014such as subliminal\nmessages to movie-goers to buy fruit instead of popcorn\u2014might be\nan effective way of encouraging consumption of healthier food. But\nthey seem to have a morally dubious character. Even if the facts are\nthat such messages have rather weak efficacy we object to their\nby-passing any possibility to avoid or resist them.\n\nSunstein has put forward what he calls a transparency condition:\n\n\nChoice architecture should be transparent and subject to public\nscrutiny, certainly if public officials are responsible for it. At a\nminimum, this proposition means that when such officials institute\nsome kind of reform, they should not hide it from the public\u2026If\nofficials alter a default rule so as to promote clean energy or\nconservation, they should disclose what they are doing. (2015: 19)\n\n\n\nThis formulation leaves open a number of issues. Are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d and \u201csubject to public scrutiny\u201d\ndifferent conditions? The \u201cminimum\u201d interpretation is only\na condition of publicity about what officials are doing. The\ngovernment could announce in advance that they are going to use\nsubliminal messages on television programs to promote health. Sunstein\nbelieves that this would satisfy his transparency condition but that\nit might be objectionable on grounds of manipulation.\n\nIt remains open for discussion how to formulate a norm which is closer\nto the intuitive idea of transparency, to distinguish various sense of\ntransparency\u2014such as narrow and broad\u2014and to debate\nwhether such transparency is a necessary component of legitimate\nnudges. Must, for example, the public utility which hopes to encourage\nenergy conservation preface its informational message about the\naverage consumption of your neighbors with the fact that they are\nsending this information because they think it will encourage\nconservation? Does it have to disclose they believe it may do so\nbecause people have a tendency to conform to what their neighbors are\ndoing?\n\nWhy is transparency required? One possible objection to\nnon-transparency is that it interferes with the autonomy of those\ninfluenced. It seems too strong to think that this is true of all\nnon-transparent nudges but a more limited claim is that a nudge limits\nautonomy when it influences an agent\u2019s choices and were she\naware of the nudge she would reject the influence and the influence\nwould no longer be effective in her choices.\n\nAnother issue concerning autonomy is whether it is affected by both\nintentional and unintentional nudges. If the cafeteria manager places\nthe food at random she will still be influencing people\u2019s\nchoices. Are the choices more autonomous in this case than in a case\nin which the food is placed in exactly the same way but deliberately\nin order to affect the choices?\n4.4 Harnessing Bad Reasoning\n\nThe second objection to nudges has to do with a specific mechanism\nthrough which the end of nudging\u2014promotion of agent\nends\u2014is sometimes accomplished. Consider the cafeteria example.\nThe reason we place the healthy foods at eye level is because there is\na tendency to choose what is at eye level over options that are not.\nThe thought is that nudgers can harness this tendency by putting\nhealthy foods at that level.\n\nSince the positioning of foods is not a rational ground for choosing\nnudgers use this non-rational tendency so that healthy foods are\nchosen. Note in this case we get both a lack of transparency and the\nharnessing of non-rational tendencies.\n\nSome argue that taking advantage of our non-rational tendencies, even\nfor good ends, is objectionable.\n\nConsider the opt-out nudge. It relies upon, and works in virtue of, the\nfact that we tend to go with the given even if there are better\noptions easily available. It is because we irrationally choose the\nworse option that we present the better option for the agent to choose\nirrationally.\n\nFraming effects: It is one of the most confirmed findings of empirical\ndecision theory that subjects decisions are affected by different ways\nof presenting information. For example, in deciding on whether to have\nan operation which can cure one\u2019s disease but has the\npossibility of causing death how one chooses is affected by whether\none is told (A) or (B):\n\n90% of patients who have the operation survive. (survival\nrate)\n10% of the patients who have the operation die.\n(mortality rate)\n\n\nThis is exactly the same information but those told\n (A)\n are more likely to choose the operation than those given\n (B).\n It is irrational to make the decision differently depending on how it\nis worded.\n\nThis harnessing of the irrational for our own good is not paradoxical\nbut it strikes some as problematic in the same way getting children to\nread by offering them financial incentives is problematic. We are\ngetting them to read for the wrong reasons. At least in these cases\nthere is the idea that once reading they will come to appreciate the\npleasures and importance of reading for its own sake. But do people\nwho stick with opt-in out of a tendency to stick with the given learn\nto change their faulty heuristic? If anything, it is reinforced\nbecause their faulty heuristic has a good consequence.\n\nIf we think of cases of rational persuasion, then in the ideal case,\nwe would find that the agent chooses because she believes she has been\ngiven reasons, these reasons support her choice, and she acts because\nof those reasons. In the case of harnessing non-rational tendencies\nfor nudges these conditions are not satisfied.\n\nIt is a good thing that, usually, we act not simply in accordance with\nthe reasons there are to act, but also out of, in recognition, of\nthose reasons. This desirable feature may be out-weighed if the goods\naccomplished by nudges are important, and alternative interventions\nare much less effective and/or require much costly or difficult to\noperate.\n\nIt is clear that while many nudges (as defined) harness bad reasoning,\nmost do not. Some do not harness reasoning at all, e.g., the\neyes/coffee case.\n4.5 Manipulation\n\nSince nudges are defined to exclude coercion, and they usually are not\ncases of outright deception (as opposed to a lack of transparency) the\nconcept that is often used to criticize nudges is that of\nmanipulation. The charge of manipulation is raised often against the\nacts of others even when, like nudging, they are benevolently\nmotivated. We think of manipulation, like other forms of paternalism\nas failing to respect us as rational and capable choosers. After all,\nif we were capable choosers why not just present us with the reasons\nwhich favor our acting in particular way?\n\n\nNudging uses the clever tricks of modern psychology and economics to\nmanipulate people. We don\u2019t like manipulation when it\u2019s\ndone to sell us things; we shouldn\u2019t like manipulation when our\ngovernments do it to us. (Wilkinson, see Other Internet Resources)\n\n\n\nThe problem is that manipulation seems a very amorphous and\nill-understood concept. There is widespread disagreement about what\nkinds of influence are manipulative and the conditions under which\nthey are wrong.\n\nThere seems to be only general agreement on the idea that in some way\nor other manipulation interferes, or perverts, or takes advantage of\nfactors that people would not want to influence, the decision making\nof agents. Whether manipulation must be intentional, whether it must\nbe hidden, whether the motive of the manipulator matters, whether\nthere has to be a gap between the way in which the influence causes\nbehavior and the reasons which justify it , whether there has to be a\nmanipulator if one is manipulated, all are contested in the literature\n(see papers in Coons and Weber 2013).\n\nEven if there were a consensus on the widely shared view that\ninterpersonal manipulation is unjustified only when there is a bypass or subversion\nof the rational capacities of the person being influenced there will\nbe much disagreement about what \u201cbypass\u201d and\n\u201csubverts\u201d come to. Does making use of framing effects in\nconveying information \u201cbypass\u201d or \u201csubvert\u201d\nrational capacities? Is harnessing a non-rational propensity of a\nperson bypassing or subverting rational capacities?\n\nPerhaps people perceive a process as manipulative only if they already\ndisapprove of it for other reasons. A recent series of experiments\ndiscovered that people\u2019s views of whether a given nudge was\nmanipulative varied with whether the nudge was in the direction of\ntheir political convictions or not (Fox and Tannenbaum 2015).\n\nIn almost every case, respondents on the left of the political\nspectrum supported nudges when they were illustrated with a liberal\nagenda but opposed them when they were illustrated with a conservative\none; meanwhile, respondents on the political right exhibited the\nopposite pattern.\n\nGiven the very different conceptions of manipulation there is\ndisagreement about why, when it is, manipulation is wrong. Because it\nviolates dignity? Because it violates autonomy? Because it violates a\nconception of liberty?\n\nIt is clear that many nudges are not plausibly examples of\nmanipulation. Warning labels, default rules such as opt-out, providing\ncaloric information on menus cannot count as manipulation without\nusing such an expansive conception of manipulation as to deprive it of\nany use.\n\nNudgers are clear that they want the influence they use to be easily\navoidable. That is why they do not consider making choices very costly\nor difficult to be a nudge. But manipulations vary in their strength\nor effectiveness. Perhaps certain subliminal messages are quite weak\nin their force; only people who already are thinking about buying\npopcorn are affected. Would only the influences that are difficult to\nevade or avoid be considered manipulative?\n\nIn the case of paternalistic acts there seemed to be only one or two\nconcepts which figure in the normative objections\u2014e.g.,\nautonomy, liberty\u2014and they belong to a similar class of values.\nIn the case of objectionable nudging there seem to be a greater\ndiversity of normative values at stake, and they seem to have no\noverarching conceptual unity.\n\nUntil more refined notions of manipulation and of subverting rational\ndecision-making are developed it may be more fruitful to look at\nspecific nudges which strike one as problematic because of some\nidentifiable features they have, and to distinguish them from other\nnudges which lack such features. There may be no common features which\nexplain why those nudges that are wrongful all fall under a plausible\nconcept of manipulation.\n5. Paternalistic Lies \n\nThere is one class of manipulation which clearly raises issues about whether the person\nbeing manipulated had had their autonomy and/or liberty interfered with--lies. Lies motivated\nby the claim that the person being lied to will have her interests advanced are the most common\nexamples of paternalism that are claimed to be, at least sometimes, justified. \n\nPaternalistic lies, and other forms of deception such as truthful but misleading assertions, raise interesting conceptual as well as normative issues.  Unlike coercion which makes certain\nchoices more costly, and hence restricts agents\u2019 options, many lies make it more difficult for the\nagent to take certain options without increasing their cost. Further this difficulty is hidden from the person being lied to. This raises the issue of what exactly are the features of the\nperson being lied to which are affected.  Is it her liberty, her freedom, her autonomy? Is it\nthe voluntariness of her action? Is it none of these things but something like her ability to\naccomplish her aims? Thinking about these questions is important in evaluating whether, and when,\npaternalistic lies are justifiable. \n\n\n\nThis discussion is about lying not deception. One can deceive without\nlying, e.g. by asserting something which you believe true but from\nwhich you know that the hearer will infer something false.  Or by not\nasserting at all as when a husband replaces his sleeping pills with\ncough medicine to prevent his wife from harming herself.  By a lie I\nmean an assertion P by A who does not believe\nthat P and intends a listener to either come to believe that\nP or at least to believe that A believes\nthat P.\n\nA lie may not in fact deceive the listener for many\nreasons\u2014P might actually be true or the listener may be\naware that she is being lied to\u2014but it is still pro tanto wrong\nas an abuse of assertion whose function is to provide evidence of what\nthe speaker takes to be the truth. Paternalistic lies are prima facie\nwrong, as Kantians would claim, because they are violations of our\nright as rational creatures to determine our ends, and the means to\nobtain them, for ourselves. \n\nSince lying is pro tanto wrong any specific lie can turn out to be\njustified if there are reasons that outweigh the ones making it\nwrong. And defenders of paternalistic lies argue there are sometimes\nharms avoided or goods produced that outweigh the harms of\nlying. Anti-paternalists argue that such calculations fail to take\ninto account that lies interfere with important values such as the\nautonomy, liberty, and rationality of the person and these values may\noutweigh the harms avoided or goods produced. \n\nLet us start with autonomy. Does being lied to interfere with, or diminish the autonomy of the\nperson being lied to?  Obviously to answer this we need to be given an understanding of what it is for a person to be, or to act, autonomously. For example, if we understand autonomy as a\ngeneral characteristic of a person\u2019s relationship to their goals, ideals, preferences, values, and so forth then the lie must affect that relationship. If the lie, for example, asserts that some value, e.g. politeness, causes mostly misery, then their autonomy understood as self-reflection on how they should live is undermined. \n\nIf, on the other hand, the lie is relevant to how, given their ends, they can best attain them\nthen what is diminished is their likelihood of achieving their autonomously chosen ends, or of\nacting in accordance with their values. Their capacity for reflective acceptance remains intact.\n\nAt the level of choosing what to do in order to attain goals, or promote ends, or acting in accordance with values, being lied to diminishes the likelihood of achieving\nany of these.  Is this failure also to be considered a diminishment of autonomy? \n\nFirst, it should be noted that being lied to does not, and is not always intended to, affect choices.  When a doctor falsely tells a patient that he does not have a fatal disease she is\ntrying to prevent the patient from becoming depressed. It is mood not particular choices that are at issue. \n\nSecond, it not clear that having choices fail because of a lie affects autonomy. If it does\nthen whenever a person, out of ignorance, has their choice fail they have acted non-autonomously.\nBut it is not obvious that when I choose a medicine on the basis of inaccurate information, and\nfail to get cured, that my choice of the medicine was not autonomous. Perhaps it is the voluntariness of my choice that is affected.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the exercise of autonomy in a given choice as requiring freedom as non-interference. This assume the actor is autonomous in some basic\ncapacity sense. And non-interference is then analyzed in terms of what makes one\u2019s choices more costly(coercion) or more difficult(deception) to pursue.\n\nAn interesting case to think about is the prescribing of placebos. In the typical case the\ndoctor is mis-leading the patient about the inert nature of the medication. But he is doing\nso because there is good reason to think that the patient will be better off for having\ntaken the placebo. The patient's practical reasoning is distorted by the lie so something\nimportant for autonomy is removed but the patient's welfare is increased.\n\nIn conclusion it seems clear that lying interferes with something significant concerning the choices and actions of the person lied to and in doing so acts prima facie wrongly. But being clearer about what is, and what what is not, diminished by paternalistic lies needs further\ninvestigation in order to evaluate the legitimacy of such lies.  \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, Larry, 2010, \u201cVoluntary Enslavement\u201d,\n<em>San Diego Legal Studies Paper No. 10\u2013042</em>, October 19,\n2010.\n [<a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1694662\" target=\"other\">Alexander 2010 available online</a>]", "Arneson, Richard J., 1989, \u201cPaternalism, Utility, and\nFairness\u201d, <em>Revue Internationale de Philosophie</em>,\n43(170(3)): 409\u201323.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2005, \u201cJoel Feinberg and the\nJustification of Hard Paternalism\u201d, <em>Legal Theory</em>,\n11(3): 259\u2013284. doi:10.1017/S1352325205050147", "Bergelson, Vera, 2007, \u201cThe Right to Be Hurt: Testing the\nBoundaries of Consent\u201d, <em>The George Washington Law\nReview</em>, 75: 165\u2013255.", "Boven, Luc, 2008, \u201cThe Ethics of Nudge\u201d, in\nGrune-Yanoff and S.O.
