Later Work on Variety, Its Value, and the Question of Normativity\n\nThe new term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d, post-1985, marked fresh\nperspectives about what variety or \u201cdiversity\u201d might mean,\nand what the benefits and values of biodiversity might be. There also\nwas a continuation and further development of the core perspectives on\nvalue established during the pre-history. Wilson (1985) made the case\nfor a \u201cbiological diversity crisis\u201d by arguing that this\nmeans the loss of potential uses, yet to be discovered. Wilson also\nechoed Myers and Ayensu (1983) and others arguing for the importance\nof systematics and the need for discovery of species to address\nknowledge gaps. Later, Wilson (1988) brought these arguments together,\narguing that the new term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d reflects our lack\nof knowledge about the components of life\u2019s variation and their\nimportance to humankind.\n\nThe pre-history perspectives, in the writings of Myers and others,\ninfluenced the Brundtland Report, a landmark United Nations report on\nsustainable development (WCED 1987). This report contains the\nmuch-quoted definition:\n\n\nSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the\npresent without compromising the ability of future generations to meet\ntheir own needs.\n\n\nThis is followed by a key requirement:\n\n\nThe loss of plant and animal species can greatly limit the options of\nfuture generations; so sustainable development requires the\nconservation of plant and animal species.\n\n\nThe report\u2019s call for governments to form a \u201cspecies\nconvention\u201d helped catalyse the creation of the Convention on\nBiological Diversity (CBD; see below).\n\nThese perspectives foreshadow later discussion themes, including:\nfurther exploration of biodiversity option value (including the\nquestion of normativity); analysis of what we mean by\n\u201cvariety\u201d and how we measure it; and further exploration\nof the \u201cinsurance\u201d aspect of biodiversity value (setting\nthe stage for a multitude of ecological interpretations of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d).\n",
