    "main_text": "The Debate Over the Self\n3. The Politics of Community\n\nIn retrospect, it seems obvious that communitarian critics of\nliberalism may have been motivated not so much by philosophical\nconcerns as by certain pressing political concerns, namely, the\nnegative social and psychological effects related to the atomistic\ntendencies of modern liberal societies. Whatever the soundness of\nliberal principles, in other words, the fact remains that many\ncommunitarians seem worried by a perception that traditional liberal\ninstitutions and practices have contributed to, or at least do not\nseem up to the task of dealing with, such modern phenomena as\nalienation from the political process, unbridled greed, loneliness,\nurban crime, and high divorce rates. And given the seriousness of\nthese problems in the United States, it was perhaps inevitable that a\nsecond wave of 1990s communitarians such as Amitai Etzioni and William\nGalston would turn to the more practical political terrain of\nemphasizing social responsibility and promoting policies meant to stem\nthe erosion of communal life in an increasingly fragmented\n society.[11]\n Much of this thinking has been carried out in the flagship\ncommunitarian periodical, The Responsive Community, which is\nedited by Amitai Etzioni and includes contributions by an eclectic\ngroup of philosophers, social scientists, and public policy makers\n[this periodical, regrettably, folded in 2004 due to financial\nconstraints]. Etzioni is also the director of a think-tank,\nInstitute for Communitarian Policy Studies, that produces\nworking papers and advises government officials in\n Washington.[12]\n\nSuch political communitarians blame both the left and the right for\nour current malaise. The political left is chastised not just for\nsupporting welfare rights economically unsustainable in an era of slow\ngrowth and aging populations, but also for shifting power away from\nlocal communities and democratic institutions and towards centralized\nbureaucratic structures better equipped to administer the fair and\nequal distribution of benefits, thus leading to a growing sense of\npowerlessness and alienation from the political process. Moreover, the\nmodern welfare state with its universalizing logic of rights and\nentitlements has undermined family and social ties in civil society by\nrendering superfluous obligations to communities, by actively\ndiscouraging private efforts to help others (e.g., union rules and\nstrict regulations in Sweden prevent parents from participating\nvoluntarily in the governance of some day care centers to which they\nsend their children), and even by providing incentives that discourage\nthe formation of families (e.g., welfare payments are cut off in many\nAmerican states if a recipient marries a working person) and encourage\nthe break-up of families (e.g., no-fault divorce in the US is often\nfinancially rewarding for the non custodial parent, usually the\nfather).\n\nLibertarian solutions favored by the political right have contributed\neven more directly to the erosion of social responsibilities and\nvalued forms of communal life, particularly in the UK and the US. Far\nfrom producing beneficial communal consequences, the invisible hand of\nunregulated free-market capitalism undermines the family (e.g., few\ncorporations provide enough leave to parents of newborn children),\ndisrupts local communities (e.g., following plant closings or the\nshifting of corporate headquarters), and corrupts the political\nprocess (e.g., US politicians are often dependent on economic interest\ngroups for their political survival, with the consequence that they no\nlonger represent the community at large). Moreover, the valorization\nof greed in the Thatcher/Reagan era justified the extension of\ninstrumental considerations governing relationships in the marketplace\ninto spheres previously informed by a sense of uncalculated\nreciprocity and civil obligation. This trend has been reinforced by\nincreasing globalization, which pressures states into conforming to\nthe dictates of the international marketplace.\n\nMore specifically in the American context, communitarian thinkers such\nas Mary Ann Glendon indict a new version of rights discourse that has\nachieved dominance of late (Glendon 1991). Whereas the assertion of\nrights was once confined to matters of essential human interest, a\nstrident rights rhetoric has colonized contemporary political\ndiscourse, thus leaving little room for reasoned discussion and\ncompromise, justifying the neglect of social responsibilities without\nwhich a society could not function, and ultimately weakening all\nappeals to rights by devaluing the really important ones.\n\nTo remedy this imbalance between rights and responsibilities in the\nUS, political communitarians proposed a moratorium on the manufacture\nof new rights and changes to our \u201chabits of the heart\u201d\naway from exclusive focus on personal fulfillment and towards concern\nwith bolstering families, schools, neighborhoods, and national\npolitical life, changes to be supported by certain public policies.\nNotice that this proposal takes for granted basic civil and political\nliberties already in place, thus alleviating the concern that\ncommunitarians are embarking on a slippery slope to authoritarianism.\nStill, commmunitarian thinkers quietly lifted the call for a\nmoratorium on the minting of new rights, presumably because of growing\nconsensus that marginalized groups, such as same-sex couples seeking\nthe right to legally sanctioned marriage, have a legitimate claim to\nnew rights (Macedo, 2015) and would be paying the price for the\nexcesses of others if the moratorium is put into effect.\n\nMore serious from the standpoint of those generally sympathetic to\ncommunitarian aspirations, however, is the question of what exactly\nthis has to do with community. For one thing, Etzioni himself seeks to\njustify his policies with reference to need to maintain a balance\nbetween social order and freedom, (Etzioni 1996) as opposed\nto appealing to the importance of community. But there is nothing\ndistinctively communitarian about the preoccupation with social order;\nboth liberals such as John Stuart Mill and Burkean conservatives\naffirm the need for order. And when the term community is employed by\npolitical communitarians, it seems to mean anything they want it to\nmean. Worse, as Elizabeth Frazer has argued, it has often been used to\njustify hierarchical arrangements and delegitimize areas of conflict\nand contestation in modern societies (Frazer 1999).\n\nStill, it is possible to make sense of the term community as a\nnormative\n ideal.[13]\n Communitarians begin by positing a need to experience our lives as\nbound up with the good of the communities out of which our identity\nhas been constituted. This excludes contingent attachments such as\ngolf-club memberships, that do not usually bear on ones sense of\nidentity and well-being (the co-authors of Habits of the\nHeart (Bellah et al. 1985) employ the term\n\u201clifestyle enclaves\u201d to describe these attachments).\nUnlike pre-modern defenders of Gemeinshaft, however, it is\nassumed that there are many valued forms of communal life in\nthe modern world. So the distinctive communitarian political project\nis to identify valued forms of community and to devise policies\ndesigned to protect and promote them, without sacrificing too much\nfreedom. Typically, communitarians would invoke the following types of\ncommunities:\n\n\n\nCommunities of place, or communities based on geographical location.\nThis is perhaps the most common meaning associated with the word\ncommunity. In this sense, community is linked to locality, in the\nphysical, geographical sense of a community that is located somewhere.\nIt can refer to a small village or a big city. A community of place\nalso has an affective component\u2014it refers to the place one calls\n\u201chome\u201d, often the place where one is born and bred and the\nplace where one would like to end one\u2019s days even if home is\nleft as an adult. At the very least, communitarians posit an interest\nin identifying with familiar surroundings.\n\nIn terms of political implications, it means that, for example,\npolitical authorities ought to consider the existent character of the\nlocal community when considering plans for development (Jane Jacobs\nfamously documented the negative effects of razing, instead of\nrenovating, run-down tenements that are replaced by functionally\nadequate but characterless low-income housing blocs (Jacobs 1965).\nEven big cities can and should strive to protect and promote a\ndistinctive ethos (Bell and de-Shalit 2011). Other suggestions to\nprotect communities of place include: granting community councils veto\npower over building projects that fail to respect existent\narchitectural styles; implementing laws regulating plant closures so\nas to protect local communities from the effects of rapid capital\nmobility and sudden industrial change; promoting local-ownership of\ncorporations; (Shuman 1999) and imposing restrictions on large-scale\ndiscount outlets such as Wal-Mart that threaten to displace small,\nfragmented, and diverse family and locally owned stores (Ehrenhalt\n1999). \n\n\nCommunities of memory, or groups of strangers who share a\nmorally-significant history. This term\u2014first employed by the\nco-authors of Habits of the Heart\u2014refers to imagined\ncommunities that have a shared history going back several generations.\nBesides tying us to the past, such communities turn us towards the\nfuture\u2014members strive to realize the ideals and aspirations\nembedded in past experiences of those communities, seeing their\nefforts as being, in part, contributions to a common good. They\nprovide a source of meaning and hope in peoples lives. Typical\nexamples include the nation and language-based ethnocultural\ngroups.\n\nIn Western liberal democracies, this typically translates into various\nnation-building exercises meant to nourish the bonds of commonality\nthat tie people to their nations, such as national service and\nnational history lessons in school textbooks. Self-described\nrepublicans such as Michael Sandel place special emphasis upon the\nnational political community and argue for measures that increase\ncivic engagement and public-spiritedness (Sandel 1996). However, there\nis increased recognition of the multi-national nature of contemporary\nstates, and modern Western states must also try to make room for the\npolitical rights of minority groups. These political measures have\nbeen widely discussed in the recent literature on nationalism,\ncitizenship, and multiculturalism (Kymlicka 1995, Miller 1995, Macedo\n2000, Tamir 1993). \n\n\nPsychological communities, or communities of face-to-face personal\ninteraction governed by sentiments of trust, co-operation, and\naltruism. This refers to a group of persons who participate in common\nactivity and experience a psychological sense of togetherness as\nshared ends are sought. Such communities, based on face-to-face\ninteraction, are governed by sentiments of trust, cooperation, and\naltruism in the sense that constituent members have the good of the\ncommunity in mind and act on behalf of the community\u2019s interest. They\ndiffer from communities of place by not being necessarily defined by\nlocality and proximity. The differ from communities of memory in the\nsense that they are more \u201creal\u201d, they are typically based\non face to face social interaction at one point in time and\nconsequently tend to be restricted in\n size.[14]\n The family is the prototypical example. Other examples include\nsmall-scale work or school settings founded on trust and social\ncooperation. \n\nCommunitarians tend to favor policies designed to protect and promote\nties to the family and family-like groups. This would include such\nmeasures as encouraging marriage and increasing the difficulty of\nlegal marriage dissolution. These policies are supported by empirical\nevidence that points to the psychological and social benefits of\nmarriage (Waite 1996). Communitarians also favor political legislation\nthat can help to restructure education in such a way that peoples\ndeepest needs in membership and participation in psychological\ncommunities are tapped at a young age. The primary school system in\nJapan, where students learn about group cooperation and benefits and\nrewards are assigned to the classroom as a whole rather than to\nindividual students, could be a useful model (Reid 1999). \n\n\nWhat makes the political project of communitarianism distinctive is\nthat it involves the promotion of all three forms of valued communal\nlife. This leads, however, to the worry that seeking the goods of\nvarious communities may conflict in practice. Etzioni, for example,\nargues for a whole host of pro-family measures: mothers and fathers\nshould devote more time and energy to parenting (in view of the fact\nthat most childcare centers do a poor job of caring for children),\nlabor unions and employers ought to make it easier for parents to work\nat home, and the government should force corporations to provide six\nmonths of paid leave and another year of unpaid leave (Etzioni 1993,\nch.2 and Etzioni 1996, ch.6). The combined effect of these changes of\nthe heart and public policies in all likelihood would be to make\ncitizens into largely private, family-centered persons.\n\nYet Etzioni also argues that the American political system is corrupt\nto the core, concluding that only extensive involvement in public\naffairs by virtuous citizens can remedy the situation: \u201conce\ncitizens are informed, they must make it their civic duty to\norganize others locally, regionally, and nationally to act on\ntheir understanding of what it takes to clean up public life in\nAmerica\u201d (Etzioni 1993, 244) But few can afford sufficient time\nand energy to devote themselves fully to both family life and public\naffairs, and favoring one ideal is most likely to erode the other.\nSurely it is no coincidence that republican America in\nJefferson\u2019s day relied on active, public-spirited male citizens\nlargely freed from family responsibilities. Conversely, societies\ncomposed of persons leading rich and fulfilling family lives (such as\ncontemporary Singapore) tend to be ruled by paternalistic despots who\ncan rely on a compliant, politically apathetic populace.\n\nCommunitarians who advocate both increased commitment to public\naffairs and strengthened ties to the workplace (to the point that it\nbecomes a psychological community) also face the problem of\nconflicting commitments. Michael Sandel, for example, speaks favorable\nof \u201cproud craftsmen\u201d in the Jacksonian era and of Louis\nBrandeis\u2019s idea of \u201cindustrial democracy, in which workers\nparticipated in management and shared responsibilities for running the\nbusiness\u201d (Sandel 1996, 170, 213) Identification with the\nworkplace and industrial democracy are said to improve workers civic\ncapacities, but that may not be the case. In the same way that\nextensive involvement in family life can conflict with commitments to\npublic life, few persons will have sufficient time and energy for\nextensive participation in both workplace and public affairs. Recall\nthat the republican society of ancient Athens relied on active,\npublic-spirited males freed from the need to work (slaves did most of\nthe drudge labor).\n\nIt is also worth noting that devotion to the workplace can undermine\nfamily life. As Tatsuo Inoue of Tokyo University argues,\nJapanese-style communitarianism\u2014strong communal identity based\non the workplace\u2014sometimes leads to karoshi (death from\noverwork) and frequently deprives workers of \u201cthe right to sit\ndown at the dinner table with their families\u201d (Inoue 1993). Just\nas liberals (pace Ronald Dworkin) sometimes have to choose between\nideals (e.g., freedom and equality) that come into conflict with one\nanother if a serious effort is made to realize any one of them fully,\nso communitarians may have to make some hard choices between valued\nforms of communal life.\n\nStill, there may be some actual or potential win-win scenarios cases\nwhere promoting a particular form of communal life can promote, rather\nthan undermine, other forms\u2014and political communitarians will of\ncourse favor change of this sort. For example, critics have objected\nto residential community associations, or \u201cwalled\ncommunities\u201d, on the grounds that they undermine attachment to\nthe polity at large and erode the social cohesion and trust needed to\npromote social justice and sustain the democratic process (McKenzie\n 1994).[15]\n Might it then be possible to reform urban planning so that people can\nnurture strong local communities without undermining attachment to the\nnational community, perhaps even strengthening broader forms of\npublic-spiritedness? Many practical suggestions along these lines have\nbeen raised. Architects and urban planners in the US known as the New\nUrbanists, for example, have proposed various measures to strengthen\ncommunity building\u2014affordable housing, public transport,\npedestrian focused environments, and public space as an integral part\nof neighborhoods\u2014that would not have the\n\u201cprivatizing\u201d consequences of gated communities. The\nproblem, as Gerald Frug points out, is that \u201cvirtually\neverything they want to do is now illegal. To promote the new urbanist\nversion of urban design, cities would have revise municipal zoning\nlaws and development policy from top to\n bottom.\u201d[16]\n This points to the need for public policy recommendations explicitly\ndesigned to favor complementing forms of communal attachments.\n\nJust as it would be wrong to assume that communitarian goals always\nconflict, so one should allow for the possibility that individual\nrights and communitarian goals can co-exist and complement each\n other.[17]\n In Singapore, for example, it can be argued that more secure\ndemocratic rights would have the effect of strengthening commitment to\nthe common national\n good.[18]\n The Singapore government does not hide the fact that it makes life\ndifficult for many who aim to enter the political arena on the side of\nopposition parties: Between 1971 and 1993, according to Attorney\nGeneral Chan Sek Keong, eleven opposition politicians were made\nbankrupt (and hence ineligible to run in\n elections).[19]\n Whether intended or not, such actions send an unpatriotic message to\nthe community at large: Politics is a dangerous game for those who\nhaven\u2019t been specially anointed by the top leadership of the\nruling party, so you should stick to your own private affairs. As\nSingaporean journalist Cherian George puts it, one can hardly blame\npeople for ignoring their social and political obligations \u201cwhen\nthey hear so many cautionary tales: Of Singaporeans whose careers came\nto a premature end after they voiced dissent; of critics who found\nthemselves under investigation; of individuals who were detained\nwithout trial even though they seemed not to pose any real threat; of\ntapped phones and opened letters\u201d. The moral of these stories:\nIn Singapore, better to mind your own business, make money, and leave\npolitics to the\n politicians.\u2019[20]\n Put positively, if the aim is to secure attachment to the community\nat large, then implementing genuinely competitive elections, including\nthe freedom to run for the opposition without fear of\n retaliation,[21]\n is an important first step (see also Chan 2014). The communitarian\ncase for democratic elections is particularly powerful in small\ncommunities where it is easier to establish a sense of communal\nsolidarity (in larger political communities, such as China, elections\nmay contribute to disharmony; see Bell 2015, chs. 1 and 4).\n\nThe Singapore case, however, points to another dimension of the\npolitics of community that brings us back to the communitarian defense\nof cultural particularism. Democratic reformers in Singapore typically\nthink of democracy in terms of free and fair competitive elections\nwhat Western analysts often label \u201cminimal democracy\u201d. In\nHong Kong, the situation is similar\u2014the aspiration to\n\u201cfull\u201d democracy put forward by social critics turns out\nto mean (nothing more than) an elected legislature and Chief\nExecutive. Put differently, it is quite striking that the republican\ntradition in communitarian thought with its vision of strong democracy\nsupported by active, public-spirited citizens who participate in\npolitical decision-making and held shape the future direction of their\nsociety though political debate seems largely absent from political\ndiscourse in Singapore and Hong Kong, and perhaps East Asia more\ngenerally. Many East Asians are clamoring for secure democratic\nrights, but this rarely translates into the demand that all citizens\nshould be committed to politics on an ongoing basis or the view that,\nas David Miller puts it, \u201cpolitics is indeed a necessary part of\nthe good life\u201d (Miller 2000). At one level, the relative absence\nof republican ideals can be explained by the fact that there are no\nequivalents of Aristotle and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in East Asian\nphilosophy. It can also be argued that republicanism fails to resonate\nbecause East Asians typically place more emphasis on other forms of\ncommunal life\u2014the family in particular has been important theme\nin Confucian ethical theory and practice (relative to Western\nphilosophy). To the extent that different forms of communal life do\nconflict in practice, in short, it may the case that different\ncultures will draw the line in different places. \n\nBut this is not to suggest that each community draws the line in its\nown way, and there is no more room for moral debate or social\ncritique. While there may be a strong case for endorsing \u201cthe\nway things are done\u201d if shared understandings conform to the\nviews shared by both defenders and critics of the political status\nquo, more often than not social critics will find fault with the\ncommunitarian excesses in particular societies. For example, Chang\nKyung-Sup argues that Korean \u201cfamilism\u201d harms individuals\nand poses a serious stumbling block to the establishment of a\ndemocratic polity in Korea (see Chang 2004). In this context, it may\nwell be counter-productive to place too much emphasis on the moral\nqualities of family\n life[22].\n But other societies\u2014relatively individualistic societies\nsuffering from the undesirable social consequences of divorce and\nsingle-parent families or communitarian societies that justify\nsacrificing families in the interests of the workplace\u2014may need\nto rejuvenate family life and they may well look to Korean\n\u201cfamilism\u201d for ideas. In other words, what seems like a\ncommunitarian excess\u2019 in one society can be a source of\ninspiration for another. \n\nSo, the conclusion is, yes, community is valuable\u2014at least as\nvaluable as the need for freedom, if not more\n so[23].\n Communitarians have usefully distinguished between forms of valuable\ncommunities and Anglo-American political communitarians have designed\nmenus of policy options to promote those forms of communities. The\nvarieties of communitarian politics in East Asia offers further\npossibilities. However, which form of community to emphasize and which\nform to deemphasize depends upon the needs and problems of particular\nsocieties. The political implications of communitarianism, in short,\ndepend upon the cultural outlooks and social priorities of particular\n contexts[24].\n \n\nLet me end with the question of why East Asians should look to\ncommunitarianism when the rich and diverse Confucian tradition can be\ndrawn upon to express communitarian values. After all, there is\nsubstantial overlap between the two philosophies\u2014both emphasize\nthe value of relationships for the good life as well as stress the\nimportance of education and non-coercive modes of moral education with\nlegal rights as last resort fall-back mechanisms (see Bell 2008, ch.\n9)\u2014so why not stick to the \u201clocal\u201d philosophy of\nConfucianism? In an East Asian context, it seems strange to promote a\ncommunitarian philosophy that was shaped by concerns about\nindividualistic excesses in Western countries when the communitarian\nConfucian tradition continues to shape values and inform \u201chabits\nof the heart\u201d (see Sun 2013; Hammond and Richey 2015; Billioud\nand Thoravel 2015). And it\u2019s still a matter of argument whether\ncommunitarianism really constitutes a philosophy or tradition, as\nopposed to a critical extension of the liberal tradition. But nobody\ndoubts that Confucianism constitutes its own tradition. So what good\nreason can there be for East Asians to identify with communitarianism\nrather than Confucianism? \n\nOne response is that Confucianism has been tainted by its apparent\nendorsement of immoral practices, such as patriarchal values that have\ncontributed to the subordination and suffering of women. But\ncontemporary feminist theorists have reinterpreted Confucianism to\nmake it more compatible with modern-day values while maintaining\ncommitment to central Confucian values (see, e.g., Chan 2007). And\nthose central Confucian values\u2014commitment to the family, to the\nmaterial well-being of the people, to meritocracy in education and\npolitics, to ritual (li), humaneness (ren),\ndiversity in harmony (he), and this-wordly outlooks\u2014may\nin fact be more appropriate for modern-day societies than many other\nphilosophies (consider the fact that most Western philosophers prior\nto the twentieth century devalued the family). Bai Tongdong, for\nexample, argues that a modernized form of central Confucian values can\ninspire humane governance both at home and abroad (Bai 2019). \n\nIn an East Asian context, what communitarianism can do is help to\nremedy the drawbacks of Confucianism. For example, there is a tension\nbetween the universalizing impulses of early\nConfucianism\u2014Confucius and Mencius did not consider the\npossibility of morally legitimate alternatives to their\nvalues\u2014and the moral pluralism that tends to characterize the\nmodern world. Communitarians can remind Confucians that their\nphilosophy may be more appropriate in certain settings than others,\nand that they should allow for the possibility of morally legitimate\nalternatives in different contexts. It seems strange, for example, for\nConfucians to think that Christian believers should change their\nprimary religious allegiance from God to family ancestors (just as it\nseems strange for Christians to ask Confucians to do the opposite).\n\n\nCommunitarian insights about civil society as the sites for moral\neducation can help to remedy the Confucian focus on the family as the\nonly (or main) springboard for moral learning. Confucians have long\nargued that it is possible and desirable to extend family values\noutside the family, but the family-centered reality in most East Asian\nsocieties with a Confucian heritage suggests that Confucianism may not\nbe sufficient. There has been some work exploring the\n\u2019intermediary associations\u2019 in Confucianism (see, e.g., de\nBary 1998), but the communitarians debates in the West may offer more\ninsights in this respect. Also, the Confucian emphasis on meritocratic\nrule by the most talented and virtuous members of the community may\nencourage excessive political passivity on the part of ordinary\ncitizens. Again, Confucians can look to communitarianism (as well as\ncontemporary debates about deliberative democracy) for insights about\nvalues and practices that allow ordinary citizens to make meaningful\ncontributions to the political process, even in political contexts\n(such as China) without democratic elections to choose top leaders.\nDemocratic education is not, to say the least, a Confucian imperative.\nIn short, communitarian insights can usefully supplement Confucian\nvalues in an East Asian context, just as they can supplement liberal\nvalues in Western societies.  Overall, though, it must be conceded\nthat communitarianism has lost salience as a motivating political\nideal in both East Asia and the West. Do we have any reason to think\nit might be revived? In East Asia, we can expect that communitarian\nthemes will continue to take the form of Confucian values. In the\nWest, however, the excesses of populism may present an opportunity for\ncommunitarian-inspired political activists. Populism, arguably, is a\nresponse to the decline of valued forms of community. Strongmen such\nas Donald Trump rail against elites and promise to restore traditional\nsources of meaning to disempowered and atomized individuals. But the\nproblem is not elitism or hierarchy per se. Any modern society needs\nhierarchies and the task is to distinguish between bad forms of\nhierarchy that benefit the powerful and oppress the weak, and good\nforms of hierarchy that express morally defensible values (Bell and\nWang 2020). Hierarchical forms of communal life can be reinterpreted\nand modernized so they are compatible with progressive values.\nWhat\u2019s missing is a social and political movement that can\nrestore and reinterpret forms of communal life appropriate for the\nmodern world.\n",
