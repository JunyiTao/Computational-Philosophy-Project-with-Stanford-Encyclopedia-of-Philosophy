    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions || (Quantum) Computation and Scientific Explanation\n5.6 (Quantum) Computation and Scientific Explanation\n\nIn the general philosophy of science literature on\n scientific explanation\n there is a distinction between so-called \u201chow-actually\u201d\nand \u201chow-possibly\u201d explanation, where the former aims to\nconvey how a particular outcome actually came about, and the latter\naims to convey how the occurrence of an event can have been possible.\nThat how-actually explanation actually explains is uncontroversial,\nbut the merit (if any) of how-possibly explanation has been debated.\nWhile some view how-possibly explanation as genuinely explanatory,\nothers have argued that how-possibly \u2018explanation\u2019 is\nbetter thought of as, at best, a merely heuristically useful\nexercise.\n\nIt turns out that the science of quantum computation is able to\nilluminate this debate. Cuffaro (2015) argues that when one examines\nthe question of the source of quantum \u201cspeed-up\u201d, one sees\nthat to answer this question is to compare algorithmic processes of\nvarious kinds, and in so doing to describe the possibility spaces\nassociated with these processes. By doing so one explains how it is\npossible for one process to outperform its rival. Further, Cuffaro\nargues that in examples like this, once one has answered the\nhow-possibly question, nothing is actually gained by subsequently\nasking a how-actually question.\n",
