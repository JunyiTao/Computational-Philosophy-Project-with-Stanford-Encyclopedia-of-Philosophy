Generalizations\n\n\nSo far in this article only single-agent justification logics, \nanalogous to single-agent logics of knowledge, have been considered. \nJustification Logic can be thought of as logic of explicit \nknowledge, related to more conventional logics of implicit \nknowledge. A number of systems beyond those discussed above have been\ninvestigated in the literature, involving multiple agents, or having \nboth implicit and explicit operators, or some combination of these.\n",
