    "main_text": "\n1. Life,  Works and Background \n\n\nAntiochus was born in the latter part of the second century B.C.E. in\nAscalon (whose site is in present-day Israel) and died in 69/8\nB.C.E. (On Antiochus\u2019 life, see Hatzimichali 2012). Early in life he\nmoved to Athens, at this time still the center of the ancient\nphilosophical world, where he became a member of the Academy, the\nphilosophical school founded by Plato in the fourth century B.C.E. He\nmay also have studied with certain of the Stoic philosophers then\nactive in Athens. His membership in the Academy dates from around 110\nB.C.E., the date when Philo of Larissa became the school\u2019s head, or\nscholarch. At this time Philo championed a form of the skepticism that\nhad been defended in the Academy since the scholarchate of \n Arcesilaus,\nin the first half of the third century B.C.E. Antiochus was for many\nyears a student and follower of Philo, whose views he defended in his\nwritings, but at an uncertain point (though before 79 B.C.E.;\nsee Section 3) he broke sharply with Philo and\nrejected skepticism (Cicero, Acad.  2.69).\n\nA measure of caution is in order. \u201cSkeptic\u201d is an ancient\nGreek term meaning inquirer. The Academics did not use it of\nthemselves; The descriptive appellation \u2018skeptic[al] \u2019 was\nfirst applied by Pyrrhonians to their school in order to signal their\ncommitment to open-minded inquiry (see the overview in the entry on\n ancient skepticism). Understood in\nthis way, the term applies at least as well to the skeptical Academy\nas to the Pyrrhonian school, which was founded or revived by\nAenesidemus, an Academic who reacted against what he saw as an\nincreasingly dogmatic tendency in the Academy of his time in the first\ncentury B.C.E. Later in antiquity the term \u201cskeptic\u201d seems\nto have been applied to both schools.  A range of arguments that, in\none way or another, call the existence or possibility of knowledge\ninto question, together with the positions or attitudes taken in\nresponse to, or expressed by, these arguments, have been styled\n\u201cskeptical\u201d, and several forms of skepticism were defended\nby different Academics in the course of the school\u2019s history.\n\n\nFrom his break with Philo Antiochus was a dogmatist, who maintained\nthat knowledge was possible and that there were truths known to him\nand other human beings. It is clear that he began a new school of\nthought and attracted followers. Later in antiquity, when different\nphases in the history of the Academy corresponding to changes in\ndoctrine and philosophical approach were distinguished, some people\nspoke of a fourth Academy of Philo and a fifth of Antiochus (Sextus\nEmpiricus [S.E.], Outlines of Pyrrhonism, i.e.,\nPyrrhoneae hypotyposes [PH] 1.220). These\ndistinctions were not meant to correspond to changes in the Academy as\nan institution, and evidence about institutional developments and the\nrelations between them and Antiochus\u2019 change in intellectual direction\nis fragmentary and unclear. It is not plain, e.g., whether he began\nexpounding his new views while still a member of the Academy or after\nforming a group around himself, which he dubbed the \u2018Old Academy\u2019 in\norder to signal his allegiance to the original Old Academy of Plato\nand his immediate successors and to contrast it with the \u2018New Academy\u2019\nof Philo and his predecessors from the time of Arcesilaus (cf. Polito\n2012) \n\n\nPolitical instability in Athens led Philo to transfer his activities\nto Rome in 88 B.C.E. We know that Antiochus was in Alexandria the\nfollowing year in the company of Lucullus, a Roman general and\nstatesman, with whom he maintained ties for the rest of his life. He\nalso exerted an influence on other prominent Romans. Cicero, though\nnot a follower of his, studied with Antiochus in Athens in 79.  Varro,\napart from Cicero the greatest Roman intellectual of the first century\nB.C.E., and Brutus, the assassin of Caesar, were adherents of\nAntiochus\u2019 philosophy (on Varro, see Blank 2012).\n\n\nNone of Antiochus\u2019 books have survived, but we know something\nabout them. He wrote an epistemological work called Canonica\nin at least two books. The title comes from\n\u2018kan\u00f4n,\u2019 meaning a ruler or straightedge, a\nterm that was used by philosophers in the Hellenistic period for the\nstandard or criterion of truth. It is cited by Sextus Empiricus in his\nsurvey of views about the criterion of truth at Against the\nprofessors, i.e., Adversus Mathematicos [M]\n7.162, 202, and modern scholars have conjectured that it was\nSextus\u2019 source for much of that survey (cf. Tarrant, 1985,\n94\u20136; Sedley, 1992). The Sosus, possibly a dialogue,\nwas also an epistemological work and belonged to the last phase of\nAntiochus\u2019 controversy with Philo\n(Cicero, Acad. 2.12). He wrote a book about the gods,\nconcerning which we know nothing more.  He sent a book to the Roman\nStoic, Balbus, in which he maintained that, despite differences in\nterminology, the Stoics and Peripatetics (as Aristotle\u2019s\nsuccessors in his school, the Peripatos, were called) were largely in\nagreement on matters of substance (Cicero, N.D. 1.16). And\nCicero informs us that he wrote in many places about his view of the\nrelation between happiness and virtue (T.D. 5.22).\n2. Overview of Antiochus\u2019 Philosophy\n\n\nAntiochus regarded the criterion of truth and the goal\n(telos, end) of human life as the two most important concerns\nof philosophy (Cicero, Acad. 2.29), and we are best informed\nabout his epistemological and ethical views. As we have seen, the\noccasion for his break from Philo was a disagreement about\nknowledge. After years of loyally defending the skepticism of Philo\nand his Academic predecessors, Antiochus came to embrace the opposing\ndogmatic position that knowledge is possible. What is more, he\nmaintained that the original or Old Academy of Plato and his immediate\nfollowers were of the same opinion. This put him in conflict with his\nmore immediate predecessors, some of whom had argued that Plato should\nalso be interpreted as a skeptic (Cicero, Acad. 1.46).  Thus,\naccording to Antiochus, it was not he who was departing from Academic\ntradition, but the institution from the time of Arcesilaus to Philo\nthat had betrayed the true Academic inheritance of the original Old\nAcademy, which he was now restoring.\n\n\nThere is a further complication. The epistemology that Antiochus\ndefended was Stoic in all essential points (Brittain 2012). This was\nobvious to his contemporaries, some of whom charged that, far from\nbeing an Academic of any kind, he was a Stoic and belonged in the Stoa\nrather than in the Academy (Acad. 2.69, 132, cf. 137;\nS.E. PH 1.235). In reply, Antiochus maintained that the Old\nAcademy, the Peripatos and the Stoa were in fundamental\nagreement. According to him, far from being an innovator, Zeno of\nCitium, the founder of Stoicism, was responsible mainly only for a new\nterminology and a handful of corrections to the Old Academic doctrine\n(Cicero,\nAcad. 1.35). Though unconvincing to many of his\ncontemporaries, this historical thesis explains how Antiochus could\ndefend Stoic epistemology against the arguments made by his Academic\npredecessors while claiming to revive the Old Academy. His arguments\nabout both epistemology and ethics were embedded in this\nreinterpretation of Academic history and thus were part of an argument\nabout who was the legitimate heir of the school\u2019s\ntradition.\n\n\nMatters were likely more complicated still, and the state of the\nevidence leaves much room for interpretative disagreement. Some\nscholars have argued that his engagement with Platonism was more\nthoroughgoing than ancient and modern interpreters who have emphasized\nhis debts to Stoicism tend to allow. The tantalizing fact that Zeno\nstudied with the Academic scholarch, Polemo, lends some plausibility\nto the idea that Stoicism was itself indebted to the Old Academy in\ncertain respects. And the case has been made that Antiochus exerted an\ninfluence on, or prefigured, developments in Middle Platonism (see\nBonazzi 2012).\n\nEpistemology and ethics belong respectively to Logic and Ethics which,\ntogether with Physics, were the three parts of philosophy recognized\nin the Hellenistic era (cf. Ac. 1, 19). We are better informed about\nAntiochus\u2019 epistemology and ethical theory than his Physics, which\naccurately reflects his own priorities, though, as we have seen, he\nwrote a book about the gods, a subject that belonged to Physics. For\nfirm evidence about Antiochean Physics we we are largely reliant on\nthe brief exposition of the views of the Old Academics and\nPeripatetics by the Antiochean spokesman, Varro, in Acad. 1\n(24\u201329), who also mentions a few \u201ccorrections\u201d by Zeno,\nwhich Antiochus may have adopted (1. 39). Here as elsewhere it is hard\nto tell whether and to what extent the resemblance between Antiochus\u2019\nview, according to which material reality is constituted by two things\nand their interaction, one active, one passive, and Stoic views\nreflects the influence of the latter on Antiochus or is evidence of an\nOld Academic influence on Stoicism (see Inwood 2012). \n3. Epistemology\n\n\nAcademic skepticism arose out of the debate, initiated by Arcesilaus,\nabout the nature and possibility of knowledge between the Academy and\nrival schools of philosophy, chiefly the Stoics. The Academy\u2019s method\nof argument was, in the first instance at least, dialectical. Their\nmodel was Socrates as depicted in Plato\u2019s Socratic dialogues, where he\nputs questions to his interlocutors and deduces conclusions unwelcome\nto them from their replies. Following Socrates\u2019 example, the Academics\ntook their premises from the doctrines of their Stoic opponents or\nfrom assumptions that the Stoics could reject only at a high cost in\nplausibility. By arguing in this way, the Academics hoped to enhance\ntheir and their opponents\u2019 understanding of the issues and, if\npossible, to progress towards the discovery of the truth that would\nresolve the question in contention. The difficulties that the\nAcademics uncovered in this way were, then, in large part internal to\ntheir interlocutors\u2019 position, and, in drawing them out, the Academics\ndid not necessarily commit themselves to a position of their own.\n\n\nStoic epistemology attempts to show how it is possible for human\nbeings to attain wisdom, which the Stoics take to be a condition\nentirely free of opinion, i.e., false or insecure judgment (see the \nsection on Logic in the entry on\n Stoicism).  For this to be possible, they\nmaintain, there must be a criterion of truth (see Striker 1990). In\ntheir theory, it is what they called a cognitive impression that plays\nthis part.  This they define as an impression from what is, stamped\nand impressed in exact accordance with what is, and such as could not\nbe from what is not (cf. Annas 1990, Frede 1999, Sedley 2002).\nCognitive impressions, then, are true impressions which are, in\naddition, distinguished by a special character belongs only to true\nimpressions (though not to all of them) and which enables human beings\nto discriminate cognitive from non-cognitive impressions. In the\nparadigm case, which the definition has in view, cognitive impressions\nare perceptual, but in a broader sense of the term, non-perceptual\nimpressions that afford an equally secure grasp of their contents can\nalso be called cognitive. According to the Stoics, by confining assent\nto cognitive impressions, it is possible to avoid error entirely.\n\n\nThe existence of the special character alleged to distinguish\ncognitive impressions from other impressions was the principal target\nof the Academics\u2019 arguments (see Section 3 of the entry on\n Carneades). \n If such impressions do not exist, it follows immediately in the\ncontext of Stoic epistemology that nothing can be known. On the basis\nof this result and the Stoic doctrine that the wise, i.e., human\nbeings as they ought to be, do not hold (mere) opinions\n(S.E. M 7.155\u20137), the Academics went on to argue that one\nought to suspend judgement about all matters.\n\n\nThese two doctrines\u2014that nothing can be known, or a claim\nthat implied it in the Stoic context, and that one ought to suspend\njudgment\u2014make up the skeptical Academic position, in the sense\nof the position put forward and defended by Academics if not\nnecessarily endorsed by them. The Stoics, followed by Antiochus in his\ndogmatic phase, argued that this position is self-refuting since to\nadopt a position is to assent to its component doctrines and assent is\nimpossible without taking oneself to know. The Stoics also argued,\nagain followed by Antiochus, that the skepticism called for by the\nAcademics\u2019 arguments was a practical impossibility since action\nis impossible without assent.\n\n\nEven though, as previously noted, the Academics were not necessarily\ncommitted to the skeptical position, they defended the possibility of\na life of committed skepticism in order to prevent the Stoics from\nescaping the difficulties raised for their position indirectly by\nmeans of these anti-skeptical arguments.  Arcesilaus made a start, but\nit was Carneades, his successor in the 2nd century B.C.E., who did the\nmost, and who was responsible for the version of the defense with\nwhich Antiochus was familiar.\n\n\nCarneades argued that, in the absence of cognitive impressions, a\nbasis for action and inquiry could be found in so-called probable\nimpressions (from probabilis, meaning that which lends itself\nto or invites approval, Cicero\u2019s Latin for the Greek\npithanos, meaning persuasive) (see Section 3 of the entry\n on Carneades).\n \n\n\nBuilding on this account of probable impressions, Carneades defended\ntwo views about assent. According to one proposal, the wise\nperson will always withhold assent, but will be able to act and\ninquire by following or using probable impressions in a way that does\nnot amount to assent, and so does not involve holding opinions about\nanything (Acad. 2.59, 99, 108). According to the second, the\nwise person will assent to what is probable and so form opinions, but\nprovisionally and on the understanding that he may be wrong\n(Acad. 2.59, 67, 78, 112).\n\n\nIt is a matter of controversy whether Carneades went beyond putting\nthese views forward for the sake of argument and actually subscribed\nto one of them. It appears, however, that some of his successors\nendorsed one or both of the skeptical doctrines. One tendency, led by\nClitomachus, Carneades\u2019 student and eventual successor as scholarch,\nfavored what we may call a radical skeptical position embracing both\ndoctrines. Though Clitomachus rejected assent, he accepted Carneades\u2019\nproposal that we could follow or use impressions without assenting to\nthem and adopted this attitude toward, among other impressions, the\nskeptical doctrines that nothing can be known and that one ought\ntherefore suspend judgment (Acad. 2.109\u201310). The other\ntendency endorsed a moderate or mitigated form of skepticism. Though\nit accepted the first skeptical doctrine, namely that nothing can be\nknown, this tendency permitted the wise to form opinions by assenting\nto non-cognitive impressions so long as they are sufficiently probable\nand the assent given to them is bestowed in the provisional spirit of\nCarneades\u2019 second proposal. And this tendency took the opinion that\nnothing can be known to be among the impressions to which one should\nassent in this way. The appearance of paradox dissolves when one\nrealizes that in accepting that one does not know anything one is not\ntaking oneself to know this, but only opining that it is highly\nprobable. The most prominent proponent of this view was Antiochus\u2019\nteacher, Philo, and it is this mitigated form of Academic skepticism\nthat Antiochus defended before his conversion to dogmatism.\n\n\nWe are informed about Antiochus\u2019 case against Academic\nskepticism by Cicero\u2019s Academica, substantial parts of which\nhave survived intact. Antiochus seems to have followed the Stoics, who\nproduced a substantial literature defending their position and\nattacking the Academy\u2019s probabilistic alternative, but also to have\nadded some elements of his own to the argument (cf. Striker 1997). He\ndefended the veracity of the senses. He seems to have argued that in\norder even to possess a concept of the truth we must indisputably\napprehend some truths in a way that is possible only if there are\ncognitive impressions (Acad. 2.33). He argued that probable\nimpressions are a wholly inadequate substitute for cognitive\nimpressions (Acad. 2.35\u20136), so that the charge that by\nabolishing the cognitive impression (as they think) the Academics\ndeprive human beings of a basis for action stands\n(Acad. 2.31, 33, 54, 62, 102\u20133, 110). And he argued that, in\nmaintaining the skeptical position, the Academics must take themselves\nto know at least one thing, viz., that nothing can be known\n(Acad. 2.28\u20139, 109; cf.  Burnyeat 1997).\n\n\nThere is one more twist in the story, however. After removing to Rome,\nPhilo published a pair of books \u2013 the so-called Roman Books \u2013\nwhich, when they came to Antiochus\u2019 attention in Alexandria, seemed to\nhim to represent a radical and intellectually untenable departure from\nhis teacher\u2019s previous position. This was the occasion for\nthe Sosus, which contained a stinging riposte to Philo\u2019s new\nideas. In opposition to Antiochus\u2019 view that there were two Academies,\nan Old and a New, Philo maintained that there had only ever been\none. But he now held that the Academics from Plato to Philo himself\nwere not united by their skepticism, as we have seen some Academics\nbelieved. Rather they had never been skeptics because they had never\nmeant to challenge the possibility of knowledge. Philo did not deny\nthat Arcesilaus and Carneades had argued against the existence of\ncognitive impressions. Rather, he now maintained that these arguments\nshowed, and were always intended to show, not that cognition or\napprehension is impossible, but that it is impossible on the Stoic\nconception of apprehension, which is therefore mistaken\n(Acad. 2.18; S.E. PH 1.235).\n\n\nPhilo\u2019s Roman innovation, then, was to reject the Stoic account of\nknowledge while continuing to accept his predecessors\u2019 arguments that\nthe requirement that cognitive impressions be set apart from other\nimpressions by a special character cannot be satisfied (cf. Barnes\n1989, 70\u201376).  For there to be knowledge, he now held, it was\nenough that there be impressions which are true and accurately formed\n(Cicero Acad. 2.18). It is not hard to see why Antiochus was\ndisturbed, for, if this is right, Philo was the legitimate heir of a\nsingle unbroken Academic tradition stretching back to Plato in which\nthere was no place for alien Stoic doctrines. Cicero, who is our\nprincipal source, chose not to recount the details of this controversy\n(Acad. 2.12). But we know that Antiochus argued that, by\nabandoning the full Stoic account of cognition and its commitment to\ncognitive impressions satisfying the complete Stoic definition, Philo\nsucceeded only in bringing about the result he most wanted to avoid,\nnamely that knowledge is impossible (Acad. 2.18). Presumably\nAntiochus drew on the case he had already brought against Academic\nprobabilism to argue that impressions which fail to satisfy the full\nStoic definition of the cognitive impression cannot provide a basis\nfor judgment of any kind let alone judgments of the kind that deserve\nto be called knowledge.\n4. Ethics\n\n\nAntiochus maintained that his ethical theory was that of the\nPeripatetics and original Old Academics just as he had maintained that\nhis Stoicizing epistemology was in substance that of the Old Academy\n(Cicero, Fin. 5.7, 14; Acad. 1.22). He could make\nthis claim about his ethical theory with more justice. On the crucial\nquestion of whether to recognize external and bodily items as goods in\naddition to virtue, he agreed with Aristotle and the Peripatos and\ndisagreed with the Stoics, who made virtue the sole good. Nonetheless,\nhis theory is greatly indebted to the Stoa, and it draws on anti-Stoic\narguments of his predecessors in the Academy that also tend to\npresuppose Stoic ideas.  Roughly speaking, Antiochus defended the\nPeripatetic view about goods on the basis of considerations and in the\ncontext of assumptions that belong to a Stoic and not an Aristotelian\nframework (cf. White 1978).\n\n\nCicero expounds and criticizes Antiochus\u2019 theory in book 5 of the\nDe finibus and draws on Antiochus in his critique of Stoic\nethics in book 4 (trans. in Annas and Woolf 2001). The Stoics\nmaintained that only virtue, which is identical with wisdom or the\nperfection of reason, is good and only vice, its opposite, evil,\nwhereas all the so-called goods, like health and strength, and their\nopposites, the so-called evils, were indifferent (see the section\nEthics in the entry on Stoicism).\nNonetheless the Stoics took some indifferents, often those generally\nregarded as goods by others, to be preferred and some, often those\ngenerally regarded as evils, to be dispreferred. This distinction\nfurnished the material or subject matter for rational\nselection. Virtue consists in fully rational selection among them. The\nwise or virtuous person acts with a view to obtaining preferred items\nand avoiding their opposites, but it is as an expression of his\nperfected reason that acts of selection are good, not because they\nsecure, or tend to secure, preferred items for him or protect, or tend\nto protect, him from their dispreferred opposites. According to the\nStoics, the sole necessary and sufficient condition for human good and\ntherefore happiness is the possession of virtue. Indifferent items\ncannot add to or detract from the goodness of such a life by their\npresence or absence.\n\n\nTo judge by Cicero\u2019s evidence from book 4 of the of the De\nfinibus, Antiochus appears to have argued against this position\nby confronting the Stoics with a dilemma.  Either the so-called\npreferred indifferents really were absolutely and utterly\nindifferent. In that case, the Stoic position collapsed into that of\nphilosophers like the heterodox Stoic, Ariston of Chios, who refused\nto make distinctions of any kind among the indifferents, thus\nrendering virtue incapable of supplying practical guidance by\ndestroying the basis for rational selection among actions (Cicero,\nFin.  4.47, 60, 69). Or speaking of preferred indifferents\nwas a merely verbal innovation, and the Stoics really regarded the\nitems they called preferred as goods, albeit lesser goods, capable of\nmaking a life better by their presence and worse by their\nabsence. Antiochus favored the latter diagnosis (Cicero,\nFin. 5.74), and his own position was that virtue is the chief\ngood, but not the sole good; this is the Peripatetic view, which he\nmay well have been right to attribute to the original Old Academy as\nwell (Cicero, Fin. 4.60, 61; 5.14; Acad. 1.22).\n\n\nThe way in which Antiochus appeals to human nature and its development\nin the exposition and defense of his ethics is modeled closely on\nStoic theory, however. To be sure, Aristotle assigns an important role\nto the development of character through habituation. But Antiochus\nfollows the Stoics and Epicureans in using what modern scholarship has\nbeen called the \u201ccradle argument\u201d (Fin.  5.55). The idea is\nthat by attending to the behavior of infants, who have not yet been\ncorrupted by contact with society, we will be able to isolate our\noriginal natural impulses and discover what the first objects of\nnatural concern or attachment are. If one accepts a general principle\naccording to which the object or objects with which we are naturally\nconcerned or to which we are attached by nature provide the basis for\ndetermining the human good, the cradle argument can be used to answer\nthe question what is the true goal of human life.\n The Epicureans maintained that infants are naturally impelled to\npleasure, and that the goal for adult humans is a life of\npleasure. The Stoics argued that our first natural impulses were not\ntoward pleasure (and away from pain) but towards the \u201cnatural\nadvantages,\u201d things like health and strength, bodily integrity and\nwell-functioning senses (and away from their opposites). But it was\nnot because they thought these items were goods; they insisted that\nthey are indifferent, though preferred. The infant\u2019s natural concern\nfor them is the first stage of a development in which what is truly\ngood only appears later. According to the Stoics, if all goes well, a\nhuman being\u2019s motives undergo a radical transformation from the\ninfant\u2019s.  Only at a later point does the human being recognize virtue\nand virtuous activity as the only human goods and act for the sake of\nthe true good.  Preferred indifferents are the material or subject\nmatter for the rational selection in which virtue consists, but\nnothing more.  Since the objects of our first natural impulses turn\nout not to be good but indifferent, to be the object of a natural\nimpulse, or to be in accord with our nature in the way such objects\nare, is not thereby to be good.\n\n\nAntiochus agrees with the Stoics about the importance of the first\nnatural impulses and, by and large, about which items are the objects\nof those impulses. But unlike them, he accepts the principle that what\nagrees or accords with a creature\u2019s fully developed adult nature, as\nit is expressed in its natural impulses, is good for that creature,\nand that the good life for human beings is therefore the life\ncharacterized by the fullest possible enjoyment of the goods\ncorresponding to our natural impulses (Cicero, Acad. 1.19,\n22; Fin. 5.24\u20135). He believes that he has an Old\nAcademic authority for this in Polemon (Cicero, Fin.  4.14;\nAcad. 2.131), head of the Academy at the end of the fourth\ncentury B.C.E. Nonetheless, despite admitting other goods, he holds\nthat virtue is the highest human good, and he believes that his theory\ncan explain why it is the chief human good without having to make it\nthe only good as the Stoics had done.\n\n\nOn his view, the development which leads a human being to virtue does\nnot involve a radical transformation of the kind posited by the\nStoics. Rather, if all goes well, a human being comes to value reason,\nand hence virtue as the perfection of reason, above all other things\nbecause reason is the most important part of human nature. It is not\nso much the character of a human being\u2019s motivation that is\ntransformed as he develops, according to Antiochus, but rather the\nself which is the object of his natural concern. As a result, though\nvirtue is the chief human good, there is room for other goods as well,\nbecause they are in accord with human nature too, albeit less\nimportant parts of it. Antiochus\u2019 use of the Stoic framework puts him\nin a position to fault the Stoics for abandoning or forgetting the\nnature from which they set out (Cicero, Fin. 4.26, 43; 5.72)\nand for failing to see the difference between taking reason to be the\nmost important part of human nature\u2014which is correct\u2014and\nthinking that it is the only part (4.41).\n\n\nLike the Stoics, however, Antiochus wants to claim that virtue is\nsufficient for happiness. Stoic ethics ensures this result by denying\nthat there are any goods or evils apart from virtue and vice and\ntherefore any items capable of affecting the goodness of a life except\nvirtue and vice. This option was not open to Antiochus because he\nthinks that there are other goods and evils, which do have this\npower. His solution, which is the most distinctive feature of his\nethical system and the one that seems to have drawn the most\ncriticism, is to distinguish between the happy life (vita\nbeata in Cicero\u2019s Latin), for which virtue is sufficient, and the\ncompletely or entirely happy life (vita beatissima)\n(Fin. 5.71, 95; T.D. 5.22), which requires bodily\nand external goods as well (see Irwin 1992).\n",
