In his\ntheory of ideas, corpuscles provide at least a structural basis for\nsimple ideas, and depending upon one\u2019s interpretation, there may\nbe a causal relationship as well. Further, and of particular interest\nhere, Locke often appears to identify a material substance\u2019s\nreal essence with the set or some subset of its component\nparticles\u2019 primary qualities. In the following well-known\npassage, for instance, he points to the primary qualities of a\nbody\u2019s parts\u2014their bulk or solidity, motion, and\nshape\u2014as the causal ground of the qualities we perceive.\n\nThe particular Bulk, Number, Figure, and Motion of the parts of\nFire, or Snow, are really in them whether any ones Senses\nperceive them or no: and therefore they may be called real\nQualities, because they really exist in those Bodies. But\nLight, Heat, Whiteness, or Coldness, are no more really\nin them, than Sickness or Pain is in Manna. Take away the\nSensation of them; let not the Eyes see Light, or Colours, nor the\nEars hear Sounds; let the Palate not Taste, nor the Nose Smell, and\nall Colours, Tastes, Odors, and Sounds, as they are such particular\nIdeas, vanish and cease, and are reduced to their Causes,\ni.e. Bulk, Figure, and Motion of Parts (E II.viii.17, pp.\n137\u2013138).\n\n\nHe similarly seems to identify the real essence of bodies with primary\nqualities just prior to the \u201cmicroscopical eyes\u201d passage.\nThere, he suggests that instead of seeing colors (or instead of seeing\nthem as we currently do), we could discover bodies\u2019 internal\nconstitutions, if only we knew the \u201ctexture and motion of the\nminute Parts of corporeal things\u201d (E II.xxiii.12, pp.\n302\u2013303). A commitment to the corpuscular hypothesis is again\nsuggested when he despairs of understanding the production of\nsecondary qualities: even if \u201cwe could discover the size,\nfigure, or motion of those invisible parts, which immediately produce\nthem [secondary qualities],\u201d we still cannot discover any\n\u201cundoubted Rules\u201d concerning their production or\nconnection, nor \u201cconceive how any size, figure, or\nmotion of any Particles, can possibly produce in us the\nIdea of any Colour, Taste, or Sound\u201d\n(E IV.iii.13, p. 545). Here, he appears to despair of understanding\nhow secondary qualities are produced by primary ones; he appears to\ntake the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s reductionist claim to be true,\nbut he despairs that we could understand how the reduction works.\n\nHis discussion of tertiary qualities is similar. If we knew the\n\u201cFigure, Size, Texture, and Motion of the minute Constituent\nparts of any two Bodies,\u201d we would then be able to derive\ntertiary qualities; we would be able to deduce that opium causes\nsleep, and we would understand why (E IV.iii.25, pp. 555\u201356; see\nalso E IV.iii.13, p. 545). In all of these passages, then, and in many\nsimilar ones, Locke appears to accept at least some components of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis\u2014that material bodies are compounded from\nminute particles, and certain observable qualities are reducible to\nthe particles\u2019 primary qualities of size, shape, and motion.\nThis tendency to speak as though the corpuscular hypothesis is true,\neither in whole or in part, has been termed Locke\u2019s\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d side (Downing 2007).\n\nIn apparent tension with this so-called dogmatic side is what has been\ntermed his \u201cagnostic\u201d or \u201cskeptical\u201d side. The\nfollowing features of his discussion seem to suggest that he has\nreasons either for remaining agnostic about whether the corpuscular\nhypothesis is true, or more seriously, for believing that it is wholly\nunable to explain the phenomena it purports to explain and therefore\ncannot be true.\n\nFirst, he refers to the corpuscular hypothesis as a hypothesis, and\none that falls well short of providing us with scientific knowledge.\nFurther, he remarks that it is not his aim to adjudicate among\ncompeting hypotheses.\n\nI have here instanced in the corpuscularian Hypothesis, as that which\nis thought to go farthest in an intelligible Explication of the\nQualities of Bodies; and I fear the Weakness of humane Understanding\nis scarce able to substitute another, which will afford us a fuller\nand clearer discovery of the necessary Connexion, and\nCo-existence, of the Powers, which are to be observed united\nin several sorts of them. This at least is certain, that which ever\nHypothesis be clearest and truest, (for that it is not my business to\ndetermine,) our Knowledge concerning corporeal Substances, will be\nvery little advanced by any of them, till we are made see, what\nQualities and Powers of Bodies have a necessary Connexion or\nRepugnancy one with another; which in the present State of\nPhilosophy, I think, we know but to a very small degree (E IV.iii.16,\npp. 547\u2013548).\n\n\nThe hypothetical status of all physical theories is underscored also\nin Some Thoughts Concerning Education: \u201cThe systems of\nnatural philosophy\u2026are to be read, more to know the\nhypotheses\u2026than with hopes to gain thereby a\ncomprehensive, scientifical, and satisfactory knowledge of the works\nof nature\u201d (Locke, quoted in Rogers 1982, p. 230). Still, while\nall physical theories are ultimately hypotheses, it is useful to bear\nin mind Peter Anstey\u2019s remarks about this one\u2019s genesis.\nThe hypothesis originated among theorists championing an experimental\nmethod over a purely speculative one, and while they did not exclude\nspeculation entirely, they circumscribed its role, engaging in it only\nafter observation and experiment had already given the theory a solid\nfoundation. Furthermore, the corpuscular hypothesis had credibility\ninsofar as its theorists avoided the question about matter\u2019s\ninfinite divisibility and thereby adhered to their prohibition against\nquestions they thought could never be answered experimentally (see\nAnstey, 2011, pp. 4\u20135).\n\nSecond, if Locke indeed identifies material bodies\u2019 real\nessences with the primary qualities of their constituent corpuscles,\nthat view of real essences combined with his pessimism about ever\ndiscovering them implies pessimism about the corpuscular hypothesis.\nSpecifically, it implies pessimism about the claims that bodies are\nmade of corpuscles and that those bodies\u2019 observable qualities\nare reducible to the corpuscles\u2019 qualities. In the same passages\nwhere Locke seems to support or assume the corpuscular\nhypothesis\u2019s central tenets\u2014that observable bodies are\nmade up of corpuscles and that those corpuscles have a restricted set\nof inherent properties\u2014he simultaneously appears very skeptical\nabout the possibility of reducing observable properties such as color\nand taste to that restricted set of primary properties.\n\nThird, Locke arguably believes that the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s\nlimitations are so serious that they amount to fatal flaws, an\ninterpretation that Wilson (1979) was perhaps the first to defend.\nAlthough Wilson develops her line of argument mainly in connection\nwith difficulties Locke raises about the corpuscular\nhypothesis\u2019s purported ability to explain sensation and more\ngenerally, the relation between thought and\n matter,[17]\n some other phenomena are troublesome as well. Locke appears to\nconsider such phenomena so obscure that we can attempt to understand\nthem only by attributing them to God\u2019s direct action.\n\nThe coherence and continuity of the parts of Matter; the production of\nSensation in us of Colours and Sounds, etc. by impulse and\nmotion; nay, the original Rules and Communication of Motion being\nsuch, wherein we can discover no natural connexion with any\nIdeas we have, we cannot but ascribe them to the arbitrary\nWill and good Pleasure of the Wise Architect (E IV.iii.29, pp.\n559\u2013560).\n\n\nElsewhere, Locke will use the term \u2018superaddition\u2019 to\nrefer to God\u2019s role. For the moment, superadded properties may\nbe neutrally described as those that God confers by fiat. Section\n3.3., which reviews some of the main positions in the debate about\nLocke\u2019s stance toward the corpuscular hypothesis, will also\naddress the various interpretations of superaddition.\n [18]\n First, however, we will examine the problematic phenomena.\n",
