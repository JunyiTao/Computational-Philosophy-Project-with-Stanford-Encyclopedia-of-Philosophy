Is a priori justification fallible and defeasible?\n\nA type of justification (say, via perception) is fallible if and only\nif it is possible to be justified in that way in holding a false\nbelief. A type of justification is defeasible if and only if that\njustification could be overridden by further evidence that goes\nagainst the truth of the proposition or undercut by considerations\nthat call into question whether there really is justification (say,\npoor lighting conditions that call into question whether vision\nprovides evidence in those circumstances).\n\nJust as we can be empirically justified in believing a false\nproposition (e.g.,\n 9b:\n two quarts of water plus two quarts of carbon tetrachloride do not\ncombine to yield four quarts of liquid), philosophers argue that we\ncan also be a priori justified in believing a false\nproposition. Perhaps Kant was a priori justified in believing\nthat every event has a cause. He thought that the proposition had that\nstatus. Yet many physicists believe that there are genuinely random\nevents at the subatomic level, and reasonably believe it false that\nevery event has a cause. You might initially be a priori\njustified in believing that no matter how happiness has been produced\nit is intrinsically good\n (12a),\n or that it is always wrong to punish an innocent person\n (13a).\n You might later think of counterexamples to such claims (e.g., by\nconsidering happiness produced through the suffering of others or\npunishing an innocent person to prevent some evil men from punishing\nhim and many other innocent people). Then your initial a\npriori justification would be defeated. John Hawthorne notes how\neven paradigmatic instances of a priori justification, such\nas someone\u2019s carefully working through a mathematical proof, can\nbe undercut if the person gets empirical evidence that he is mad or\nthat his proof is probably mistaken (based on evidence provided by\nexpert testimony, a bad track record, or of distorting background\nconditions, etc.) (Hawthorne 2013: 2009). These examples seem to show\nthat a priori justification is fallible and defeasible (i.e.,\nit can be defeated by further a priori or empirical\nevidence).\n\nConsider another example that makes this point. A sorites paradox\ninvolving heaps consists of the general claim that if you take one\nbean away from a heap of beans, you still have a heap, and a more\nspecific claim that, say, any cone-shaped stack of a thousand beans is\na heap. These two premises will lead you, bean by bean, to the\nconclusion that one, or even no beans, is a heap! It seems that we are\na priori justified in believing both the general and the more\nspecific claim are true, but at least one of them must not be true\n(perhaps the general claim is false, or even neither true nor false)\nbecause together they lead to an absurd conclusion. So this is another\nreason to think that a priori justification is fallible. (See\nSosa 1998: 258\u2013259, for an example about heaps.) George Bealer\nargues that philosophical paradoxes show that intuition is fallible\n(1998: 202). With a paradox, you are justified in believing each of a\nset of propositions taken separately, but at least one of them must be\nfalse because the set is inconsistent.\n\nWhy have some thought that a proposition that is a priori\njustified cannot be defeated by empirical evidence? Kant said that\na priori knowledge is \u201cknowledge that is absolutely\nindependent of all experience\u201d (Kant 1787 [1965: 43(B3)]). But\nit might be that the requirement that a priori knowledge be\nabsolutely independent of all experience is\ntoo stringent. Enabling experiences may be required. It avoids this\ndifficulty to hold instead that a priori knowledge and\njustification are independent of all experience beyond what is\nneeded to grasp the relevant concepts involved in the relevant\nproposition (see, below,\n sec. 4.1).\n The fact that a priori knowledge is not independent of all\nexperience does not show that it is empirically defeasible, but it\ndoes defeat the argument that it is not empirically defeasible\nbecause it is independent of all experience.\n\nWhen it is just a matter of a priori justification, not\nknowledge, Philip Kitcher thinks that if there is such a thing as all\nthings considered a priori justification, then \u201ca\nperson is entitled to ignore empirical information about the type of\nworld she inhabits\u201d (Kitcher 1983: 30; see, also, 24,\n80\u201387). This view seems to rest on Kant\u2019s idea but applied\nto justification, not just knowledge. If a priori\njustification is independent of all empirical experience,\nthen no such experience can count either for or against a\nproposition that is justified a priori. Hilary Putnam thinks\nthat if there is a priori justification, then there are\n\u201ctruths which it is always rational to believe\u201d (Putnam\n1983: 90). On Kitcher\u2019s understanding of a priori\njustification, it is not defeasible by empirical information;\non Putnam\u2019s, it is not defeasible at all.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how either view is defensible in light of the\nobjections by Sosa, Bealer, and Hawthorne. Insofar as justification is\nrelative to the evidence a person has, or should have, it seems\npossible for further evidence, either empirical or from intuition or\nrational insight, to override or undercut a person\u2019s current\nevidence and thereby destroy that person\u2019s current justification\nand knowledge. Nothing in the nature of a priori\njustification rules out that possibility. (See the discussion of\nHartry Field, in\n Section 4.5\n below, for more on why it is possible for empirical evidence\nin particular to defeat a priori justification.)\n\nUp to this point, the discussion has focused on the sorts of\npropositions that can be justified, or known, a priori, and\nwhether a priori justification is fallible and defeasible.\nBut what does it mean to say that someone is a priori\njustified in believing propositions like those expressed by each of\nthe first sentences in the fifteen examples above, that is, by\n 1a\u201315a?\n The discussion will now focus on that question.\n\nThen I will turn to the three main views about the nature of a\npriori justification. One view is that a priori\njustification is not significantly different from empirical\njustification. A second view is that it rests on a distinct type of\ninternal mental state often called rational intuition or rational\ninsight and that those intuitions or insights can provide evidence for\nor against certain propositions. A third view is that a person can be\na priori entitled to believe certain propositions\nindependently of any evidence, or can be default reasonable in\naccepting a proposition independent of any evidence.\n",
