    "main_text": "Varieties of Functionalism || Machine State Functionalism\n3.1 Machine State Functionalism\n\nThe early functionalist theories of Putnam (1960, 1967; see also Block\nand Fodor 1972) can be seen as a response to the difficulties facing\nbehaviorism as a scientific psychological theory, and as an\nendorsement of the (new) computational theories of mind which were\nbecoming increasingly significant rivals to it. (But see Putnam 1988,\nfor subsequent doubts about machine functionalism, Chalmers 1996b, for\na response, and Shagrir 2005, for a comprehensive account of the\nevolution of Putnam\u2019s views on the subject)\n\nAccording to machine state functionalism, any creature with a\nmind can be regarded as a Turing machine (an idealized finite state\ndigital computer), whose operation can be fully specified by a set of\ninstructions (a \u201cmachine table\u201d or program) having the\nform:\n\nIf the machine is in state Si, and receives input\nIj, it will go into state Sk\nand produce output Ol (for a finite number of\nstates, inputs and outputs). \n\nA machine table of this sort describes the operation of a\ndeterministic automaton, but most machine state\nfunctionalists (e.g. Putnam 1967) take the proper model for the mind\nto be that of a probabilistic automaton: one in which the\nprogram specifies, for each state and set of inputs, the\nprobability with which the machine will enter some subsequent\nstate and produce some particular output.\n\nOn either model, however, the mental states of a creature are to be\nidentified with such \u201cmachine table states\u201d\n(S1,\u2026,Sn). These states\nare not mere behavioral dispositions, since they are specified in\nterms of their relations not only to inputs and outputs, but also to\nthe state of the machine at the time. For example, if believing it\nwill rain is regarded as a machine state, it will not be regarded\nas a disposition to take one\u2019s umbrella after looking at the\nweather report, but rather as a disposition to take one\u2019s\numbrella if one looks at the weather report and is in the\nstate of wanting to stay dry. So machine state functionalism can avoid\nwhat many have thought to be a fatal difficulty for behaviorism. In\naddition, machines of this sort provide at least a simple model of how\ninternal states whose effects on output occur by means of mechanical\nprocesses can be viewed as representations (though the\nquestion of what, exactly, they represent has been an ongoing\ntopic of discussion (see sections 4.4\u20135). Finally, machine table\nstates are not tied to any particular physical (or other) realization;\nthe same program, after all, can be run on different sorts of computer\nhardware.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see, therefore, why Turing machines provided a\nfruitful model for early functionalist theories. And the idea that\nmental states are best regarded as computational states appears in\nmany theories of the mind (see, for example, Rey 1997; but see\nPiccinini 2004 for dissent and the entry on the\n computational theory of mind\n for a comprehensive discussion of this question). Nonetheless,\nbecause machine table states are total states of a system, most\ncontemporary functionalists \u2013 both analytic functionalists and\npsychofunctionalists \u2013 have adopted another way of\ncharacterizing mental states, namely, as states implicitly defined by\nthe co-called Ramsey-sentence of a psychological theory \u2013 either\none that derives from our commonly held beliefs about the causal roles\nof mental states in the production of behavior, or from the results of\nempirical psychological investigation. This will be the focus of the\nnext section.\n",
