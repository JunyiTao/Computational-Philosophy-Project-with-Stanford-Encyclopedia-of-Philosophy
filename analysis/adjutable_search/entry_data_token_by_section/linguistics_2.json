    "main_text": "Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism || The Emergentists\n1.2 The Emergentists\n\nEmergentists aim to explain the capacity for language in terms of\nnon-linguistic human capacities: thinking, communicating, and\ninteracting. Edward Sapir expressed a characteristic Emergentist theme\nwhen he wrote:\n\nLanguage is primarily a cultural or social product and must be\nunderstood as such\u2026 It is peculiarly important that linguists,\nwho are often accused, and accused justly, of failure to look beyond\nthe pretty patterns of their subject matter, should become aware of\nwhat their science may mean for the interpretation of human conduct in\ngeneral. (Sapir 1929: 214)\n\n\nThe \u201cpretty patterns\u201d derided here are characteristic of\nstructuralist analyses. Sociolinguistics, which is much closer in\nspirit to Sapir\u2019s project, studies the influence of social and\nlinguistic structure on each other. One particularly influential\nstudy, Labov (1966), examines the influence of social class on\nlanguage variation. Other sociolinguists examine the relation between\nstatus within a group on linguistic innovation (Eckert 1989). This\ninterest in variation within languages is characteristic of\nEmergentist approaches to the study of language.\n\nAnother kind of Emergentist, like Tomasello (2003), will stress the\nrole of theory of mind and the capacity to use symbols to change\nconspecifics\u2019 mental states as uniquely human preadaptations for\nlanguage acquisition, use, and invention. MacWhinney (2005) aims to\nexplain linguistic phenomena (such as phrase structure and constraints\non long distance dependencies) in terms of the way conversation\nfacilitates accurate information-tracking and\nperspective-switching.\n\nFunctionalist research programs generally fall within the broad\ntendency to approach the study of language as an Emergentist.\nAccording to one proponent:\n\nThe functionalist view of language [is] as a system of communicative\nsocial interaction\u2026 Syntax is not radically arbitrary, in this\nview, but rather is relatively motivated by semantic,\npragmatic, and cognitive concerns. (Van Valin 1991, quoted in Newmeyer\n1991: 4; emphasis in original)\n\n\nAnd according to Russ Tomlin, a linguist who takes a functionalist\napproach:\n\nSyntax is not autonomous from semantics or pragmatics\u2026the\nrejection of autonomy derives from the observation that the use of\nparticular grammatical forms is strongly linked, even\ndeterministically linked, to the presence of particular semantic or\npragmatic functions in discourse. (Tomlin 1990, quoted by Newmeyer\n(1991): 4)\n\n\nThe idea that linguistic form is autonomous, and more specifically\nthat syntactic form (rather than, say, phonological form) is\nautonomous, is a characteristic theme of the Essentialists. And the\nclaims of Van Valin and Tomlin to the effect that syntax is\nnot independent of semantics and pragmatics might tempt some\nto think that Emergentism and Essentialism are logically incompatible.\nBut this would be a mistake, since there are a large number of\nnonequivalent autonomy of form theses.\n\nEven in the context of trying to explain what the autonomy thesis is,\nNewmeyer (1991: 3) talks about five formulations of the thesis, each\nof which can be found in some Essentialists\u2019 writings, without\n(apparently) realizing that they are non-equivalent. One is the\nrelatively strong claim that the central properties of linguistic form\nmust not be defined with essential reference to\n\u201cconcepts outside the system\u201d, which suggests that no\nprimitives in linguistics could be defined in psychological or\nbiological terms. Another takes autonomy of form to be a\nnormative claim: that linguistic concepts ought not\nto be defined or characterized in terms of non-linguistic concepts.\nThe third and fourth versions are ontological: one denies that central\nlinguistic concepts should be ontologically reduced to\nnon-linguistic ones, and the other denies that they can be.\nAnd in the fifth version the autonomy of syntax is taken to deny that\nsyntactic patterning can be explained in terms of meaning or\ndiscourse functions.\n\nFor each of these versions of autonomy, there are Essentialists who\nagree with it. Probably the paradigmatic Essentialist agrees with them\nall. But Emergentists need not disagree with them all. Paradigmatic\nfunctionalists like Tomlin, Van Valin and MacWhinney could in\nprinciple hold that the explanation of syntactic form, for example,\nwill ultimately be in terms of discourse functions and semantics, but\nstill accept that syntactic categories cannot be reduced to\nnon-linguistic ones.\n",
