    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Natural Kinds\n3. The Epistemology of Natural Kinds\n\nMany of these considerations from the practice of classification\nin the special sciences have led to an emerging naturalist approach to\nthe topic of natural kinds. It is clear from the examination of\nclassification in the special sciences, that it is difficult to find a\nconcept of natural kind that fits all of the different practices of\nclassification. This has sometimes been used as a core argument in\nfavour of pluralism about natural kinds (Dupr\u00e9 2001) or to\neliminate the need for natural kinds altogether (Hacking\n2007a). Additionally, this first argument has been used to support the\nhomeostatic property cluster view of kinds, because this takes a more\nliberal approach to classification. Indeed one of the motivations for\nBoyd\u2019s original HPC view was to outline an account of natural\nkinds that was liberal enough to accommodate a diversity of natural\nkinds, also including the kinds in the biological and social\nsciences.\n\nMany of the claims made in support of pluralism stem from concerns\nabout natural kind classification in the context of scientific\npractice. This approach tends to examine specific scientific case\nstudies and derive philosophical implications about classification\nfrom the examination of these classificatory practices (Kendig 2015).\nIt is important to point out that many of the discussions are\nepistemic in nature; that is to say the claim that there are different\nways to classify in scientific practice, which are all equally\nlegitimate ways of generating knowledge for practising scientists\ndepending on their theoretical interests and research questions.\n\nIn recent literature, some have argued for a move away from the\nmetaphysics of natural kinds to an epistemology-first approach to\nclassification. Slater (2015), Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015) argue that\nthe epistemic value of natural kinds can be considered independently\nfrom the metaphysics of natural kinds. They claim that it is more\nfruitful to be led by classification in scientific practice first and\nforemost. A philosophical account of our classificatory practices\nshould describe how kinds are made in the context of scientific\npractice, we might refer these as acts of \u201ckinding\u201d.\nSlater claims that what matters for classification is the role that\nour classes play in inductive inferences within the context of\nscientific practice. Slater argues that this requires a minimal\nmetaphysical commitment \u201cthat these properties be sufficiently\nstably co-instantiated to accommodate the inferential and explanatory\nuses to which particular sciences are put\u201d Slater (2015), p.\n396). Similarly, Magnus (2012) argues that a natural kind in a domain\nallows enquiry in the domain to achieve inductive and explanatory\nsuccess, a success which would be impossible without a pre-existing\ncommitment to a natural kind classification.\n\nAdditionally, those that take an epistemology first approach are\ncritical of metaphysical accounts of natural kinds which are overly\nprescriptive and homogeneous about what counts as a natural kind. The\nconsequence of taking a metaphysics first approach is that many of the\nimportant and heterogeneous practices of kinding that are used in the\ncontext of scientific practice do not count as natural kind\nclassifications in the metaphysical sense. The implication here is\nthat an epistemology first approach is more consistent with a\ndescriptive and naturalistic account of classification.\nEpistemological accounts of natural kinds must come first and our\nmetaphysical accounts must be informed by these epistemological\nconsiderations.\n\nEreshefsky and Reydon (2015) have argued that this has led to a\nfundamental mismatch between scientific kinds and natural kinds. In\nthe homeostatic property cluster view of kinds, the overarching\nprinciples of similarity and homeostatic mechanisms lead to many\nexamples of scientific kinds which do not then count as natural kinds.\nFor example, according to Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015), non-causal,\nfunctional and heterostatic kinds would not count as natural kinds\ndespite the fact that many successful scientific kinds are non-causal,\nfunctional or heterostatic.\n\nIn contrast, Lemeire (2018) argues that a purely epistemic approach to\nnatural kinds is misguided. The epistemic approach rests on the\nassumption that for kind categories to be epistemically fruitful, they\nhave to get something right about the world. However, epistemic\nsuccess is constrained by deference to the world not only in cases of\nnatural kind classification, but also in cases of conventional and\npragmatic classification, where the product of kinding is not\nconsidered to be a natural kind. For this reason, Lemiere argues that\na purely epistemic approach fails to give us a principled way of\ndistinguishing between the natural kinds and their conventional\ncounterparts. A metaphysical account of which features individuals\nrequire to be considered as natural kinds is required to lead our\ncategorization practices. An epistemic approach alone cannot provide a\nprincipled way of doing this.\n\nKendig and Grey (2021) are also critical of purely epistemic\napproaches to natural kinds. They accept that there is value to\nepistemology first accounts of natural kinds in so far as they\nhighlight the epistemic value of natural kind classifications to\nscientists. Nevertheless, they argue that doing this successfully\nrequires accurate metaphysical presuppositions. Their argument focuses\non Slater\u2019s HPC view of natural kinds to expose why metaphysical\npresuppositions are necessary for our categorisation practices. They\nclaim that it is not possible to evaluate the stability of a cluster\nof properties without taking stock of the metaphysical picture used to\naccount for that stability\n\nReydon (2016) has argued for a model which attempts to reconcile and\nintegrate the metaphysics and the epistemology in the act of\nclassification. On his co-creation model of natural kinds, both nature\nand the classifier are constitutive of the creation of kinds\u2019\n(p. 70); kinds are \u2018co-determined by aspects of the state of\naffairs in nature as well as by background assumptions and decisions\nby investigators\u2019 (p. 59).\n",
