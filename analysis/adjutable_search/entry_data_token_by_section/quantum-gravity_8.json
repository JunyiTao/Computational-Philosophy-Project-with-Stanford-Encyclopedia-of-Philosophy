But it also stems\nfrom the fact that most theories of quantum gravity appear to predict\ndepartures from classical relativity only at energy scales on the\norder of 1019 GeV. (By way of comparison, the proton-proton\ncollisions at Fermilab have an energy on the order of 103\nGeV.) Whereas research in particle physics proceeds in large part by\nexamining the data collected in large particle accelerators, which are\nable to smash particles together at sufficiently high energies to\nprobe the properties of atomic nuclei in the fallout, gravity is so\nweak that there is no physically realistic way to do a comparable\nexperiment that would reveal properties at the energy scales at which\nquantum gravitational effects are expected to be\nimportant\u2014it would take a particle accelerator of galactic size\nto even approach the required energies. (In a little more detail, the\nweakness of gravity can be compared to the strength of the\nelectromagnetic interaction \u2014 cf. Callender and Huggett (eds.)\n2001, p. 4. An electron couples to the electromagnetic field with a\nstrength of 10\u22122, while the coupling of a mass to the\ngravitational field is 10\u221222. Feynman (1963, p. 697)\ngives an example that highlights this difference in magnitudes more\ndramatically by showing how the gravitational coupling between a\nproton and an electron in a hydrogen atom would shift the\nwave-function of an electron by just 43 arcseconds over a time period\nof 100 times the age of the Universe! Hence, quantum gravity is more\nof a theorist\u2019s problem.)\n\nThough progress is being made in trying to at least draw observational\nconsequences of loop quantum gravity, a theory of quantum gravity\nwhich arguably does make predictions (Amelino-Camelia, 2003,\nin the Other Internet Resources section below; D. Mattingly, 2005), it\nis remarkable that the most notable \u201ctest\u201d of quantum\ntheories of gravity imposed by the community to date involves a\nphenomenon which has never been observed, the so-called Hawking\nradiation from black holes. Based on earlier work of Bekenstein (1973)\nand others, Hawking (1974) predicted that black holes would radiate\nenergy, and would do so in proportion to their gravitational\n\u201ctemperature,\u201d which was in turn understood to be\nproportional to their mass, angular momentum, and charge. Associated\nwith this temperature is an entropy (see the entry on\n the philosophy of statistical mechanics),\n and one would expect a theory of quantum gravity to allow one to\ncalculate the entropy associated with a black hole of given mass,\nangular momentum, and charge, the entropy corresponding to the number\nof quantum (micro-)states of the gravitational field having the same\nmass, charge, and angular momentum. (See Unruh, 2001, and references\ntherein.) In their own ways, string theory and loop quantum gravity\nhave both passed the test of predicting an entropy for black holes\nwhich accords with Hawking\u2019s calculation, using very different\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom. String theory gets the number right\nfor a not-particularly-physically-realistic subset of black holes\ncalled near-extremal black holes, while loop quantum gravity gets it\nright for generic black holes, but only up to an overall constant.\nMore recently, the causal set approach has also managed to derive the\ncorrect value. If the Hawking effect is real, then this\nconsonance could be counted as evidence in favor of either or both/all\ntheories.\n\nErik Curiel (2001) has argued against the manner in which the ability\nto derive the Bekenstein-Hawking result as a theorem of an approach is\nused as evidence for that approach in much the same way that\nempirical evidence is used to justify a theory in normal\ncircumstances, say predicting the value of a well-confirmed\nexperimental result. It is true that black hole physics is used as\ntesting ground for quantum gravity and the Bekenstein-Hawking result\ndoes not have the status of an empirical fact. However, it is a strong\ndeduction from a framework that is fairly mature, namely\nquantum field theory on a curved spacetime background. In this sense,\nalthough it does not provide a constraint as strong as an\nexperimentally observed phenomenon, it might legitimately function as\na constraint on possible theories. Constraints on theory construction\ncome in a variety of shapes and sizes, and not all take the form of\nempirical data \u2014 thought experiments are a case in point. In the\ncontext of quantum gravity it is especially important that one have\nsome agreed upon constraints to guide the construction. Without them,\nwork would halt. It also seems reasonable to insist that a full theory\nof quantum gravity be able to reproduce predictions of the\nsemi-classical theory of gravity, since this will be one of its\npossible limits. Still, Curiel is right that researchers ought to be\nrather more wary of attributing too much evidential weight to such\nfeatures that remain empirically unconfirmed.\n\nCuriel goes on to question, more generally, the ranking of approaches\nto quantum gravity given what he views as the absence of demonstrated\nscientific merit in any of them: elegance and consistency might well\nbe merits of a scientific theory, but they do not count as\nscientific. (ibid, p. S437). However, this claim hinges on the\ndirect alignment of scientific merit and empirical clout; but this\nrequires an argument, for it is far from obvious: from whence this\nprescription? Surely if a theory is mathematically inconsistent that\nsays something about its physical status too? Moreover, the\nrelationship between experimental and observational data and theories\nis not a simple matter. Finally, it is perhaps too quick to say that\napproaches do not have empirical consequences. Already known empirical\ndata can confirm the predictions of a theory; therefore, it is clear\nthat we can judge the extent to which the various contenders satisfy\nthis old evidence, and how they do so. For example, string theory at\nleast has the potential of explaining why there are three generations\nof elementary particles by invoking the Euler characteristic of the\ncompact spaces it employs\u2014the Euler characteristic is equal to\ntwice the number of generations (see Seifert, 2004, for details).\nWhatever one might think about string theory\u2019s relationship with\nanthropic reasoning, we do have here a potential explanation of a\npreviously inexplicable piece of old empirical data, which ought to\nlend some credence to the theory. There is also the not inconsiderable\nfact that string theory is able to derive general relativity (and all\nthe physically observed facts that are associated with this theory) as\na low energy feature. This is not a novel fact, but it is an\nphysical, empirical consequence of the theory nonetheless.\n\nHowever, it should be noted, finally, that to date neither of the main\nresearch programs has been shown to properly reproduce the world we\nsee at low energies. Indeed, it is a major challenge of loop quantum\ngravity to show that it indeed has general relativity as a low-energy\nlimit, and a major challenge of string theory to show that it has the\nstandard model of particle physics plus general relativity as a\nlow-energy limit. There are promising indications that both theories\nmight be able to overcome this challenge (see Thiemann for the loop\nquantum gravity case; for the string theoretic case, see Gra\u00f1a,\n2006). A similar problem faces causal set theory in the form of the\n\u2018inverse problem\u2019, which roughly amounts to the difficulty\nof getting continuous manifolds (with their corresponding symmetries)\nfrom a fundamentally discrete theory (see Wallden, 2010, for a good\nrecent review of causal sets, including a discussion of this problem,\non which progress has also been made).\n",
