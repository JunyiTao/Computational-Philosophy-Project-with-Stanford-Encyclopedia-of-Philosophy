    "main_text": "Teleosemantic Theories || Desire-First Theories\n3.3 Desire-First Theories\n\nDavid Papineau\u2019s theory also emphasizes the \u2018use\u2019 of\nrepresentations in the production of behavioral output, but does so in\na different way than Millikan\u2019s account. In a first step,\nPapineau (1984, 1987, 1993, 1998) identifies a desire\u2019s content\nwith the effect it is supposed to produce; then, in a second step, he\nprovides an account of belief content in terms of desire content.\nHence, his theory can aptly be described as a\n\u2018desire-first\u2019 version of teleosemantics.\n\nIn a bit more detail, the theory runs as follows. According to\nPapineau, a desire\u2019s satisfaction condition is \u201cthat\neffect which it is the desire\u2019s biological purpose to\nproduce\u201d (1993, 58\u201359), by which he means that\n\u201c[s]ome past selection mechanism has favored that desire \u2013\nor, more precisely, the ability to form that type of desire \u2013 in\nvirtue of that desire producing that effect\u201d (1993, 59). So our\ndesires have the function of bringing about certain conditions \u2013\neither conditions that enhanced the fitness of our ancestors in the\ndistant past (if the selection mechanism in question was natural\nselection) or conditions that constituted a reward for us in the\nrecent past (if the selection mechanism was a mechanism of individual\nlearning). These conditions are the satisfaction conditions of our\ndesires or, in other words, their contents.\n\nThe truth condition of a belief, Papineau tells us, can (roughly) be\nequated with \u201cthat condition which guarantees that actions based\non that belief will satisfy the desires it is acting in concert\nwith\u201d (1993, 70). Suppose that I have the desire to get food\n(which is, on Papineau\u2019s view, a desire with the function of\nbringing it about that I get food), and this desire collaborates with\na certain belief B to cause me to go and look in the fridge. On\nPapineau\u2019s view, it seems that we can say that B has the content\nthat there is food in the fridge, because there being food in the\nfridge is the condition that guarantees that my desire to get food\nwill be satisfied by the action I am performing.\n\nBoth parts of Papineau\u2019s theory have been criticized. Against\nhis account of desire content, critics have raised two main types of\nobjections. First, they have proposed straightforward counterexamples\nto the account: cases where a desire has p as a satisfaction\ncondition, but where it seems that the desire cannot possibly have the\nfunction of bringing it about that p (En\u00e7 1994; Loewer 1997,\n116\u2013117). These counterexamples include entirely novel desires, like\nJohn\u2019s desire to bury his broken iPhone 12 under a Magnolia\ntree, which lack a selectional history and thus, prima facie, a\nfunction. They also include desires directed at actions that have\nnever been fitness-enhancing or rewarding, like the desire to commit\nsuicide, and desires that cannot contribute to their own satisfaction,\nlike the desire for sunny weather or the desire to change the\npast.\n\nIn reply to this line of criticism, Papineau could appeal to the\ncompositionality of desires (in the way that he appeals, in the case\nof a closely related problem, to the compositionality of beliefs; cf.\nPapineau 1993, 75 and 82\u201383). In short, he could argue that once some\nbasic desires and beliefs have content, the concepts that are the\nconstituents of these attitudes acquire contents as well (in virtue of\nthe role they play within these attitudes), and these concepts can\nthen be recombined to produce further desires which may be entirely\nnovel, incapable of contributing to their own satisfaction, or\ndirected at actions that are neither fitness-enhancing nor rewarding.\nHowever, this solution would have to be spelled out in detail in order\nto be fully convincing.\n\nA second line of objection against Papineau\u2019s account of desires\nis that it leaves desire content highly indeterminate. My desire for\nfood, for instance, usually gives rise to a whole chain of events: the\noccurrence of certain bodily movements, the ingestion of food, the\nuptake of nutrients and, ultimately, the enhancement of my biological\nfitness. Arguably, all of these events could be characterized as\n\u201ceffects which it is the desire\u2019s biological purpose to\nproduce\u201d, so it may seem that the theory does not assign a\nunique content to my desire. In a later paper, Papineau (1998, 9)\nattempts to solve this problem by saying that a desire\u2019s content\nis determined by its \u201cspecific function\u201d, where the\nspecific function of a trait is \u2018\u2018the immediate\neffect it produces at the lowest level of description where it appears\nas an unanalysed component in the functional analysis\u2019\u2019\n(Papineau 1998, 4; our \n emphasis).[14]\n This move rules out contents\nlike I induce the uptake of nutrients or I enhance my\nbiological fitness (for the desire that is, ex hypothesi, a\ndesire for food), but it is controversial whether it succeeds in fully\nresolving the indeterminacy problem (cf. Schulte 2019, 164\u2013168).\n\nPapineau\u2019s account of belief content, which is adapted from the\n\u2018success semantics\u2019 of Frank Ramsey (1927) and J.T. Whyte\n(1990), also faces some problems. The first problem is that none of\nthe actions we ordinarily perform are based on a single belief. If I\ngo to the fridge to look for food, my action is not only based on the\nbelief that there is food in the fridge, but also on my belief about\nthe location of the fridge in my apartment, about my own current\nposition, about my physical abilities, and so on. Papineau (1993, 73)\nrecognizes this problem and proposes the following solution: his\ninitial formula should be applied to sets of beliefs on which actions\nare based, and the truth-conditions of a single belief should then be\nidentified by comparing the collective truth-conditions of different\nsets which contain that belief as a member. Even if this solution\nworks, however, a second problem remains: the truth of all the beliefs\non which my action is based still does not guarantee that my\naction will be successful, not only because (for all we know) the laws\ngoverning our universe are indeterministic, but also because my\nsuccess requires that a number of background conditions hold\n(conditions involving gravity, the concentration of oxygen, etc.),\nabout which I may have no beliefs at all (Perry 1993). This suggests\nthat Papineau\u2019s account of belief content must be modified\nfurther, but it is unclear how this should be done (for two different\nproposals, cf. Blackburn 2005 and Nanay 2013).\n\nFinally, we should note that there is one respect in which\nPapineau\u2019s view has changed somewhat in recent years. In his\nearlier writings, Papineau focuses on organisms with a belief-desire\npsychology and is doubtful whether we can attribute determinate\ncontents to creatures with simpler mechanisms of behavior control\n(see, e.g., Papineau 1998, 5). In his most recent paper on the topic,\nhowever, Papineau (2016) proposes a new general account of content\nthat also applies to those simpler creatures. According to this\naccount, a representation R is always part of a producer-consumer\nsystem S, and the content of R is the condition p that ensures that\nthe behavior generated by the consumer in response to R fulfills the\nspecific function of S (Papineau 2016, 100). For organisms that\npossess beliefs and desires, the desire-first account sketched above\nstill applies, but as a special case of the more general\nproducer-consumer theory.\n",
