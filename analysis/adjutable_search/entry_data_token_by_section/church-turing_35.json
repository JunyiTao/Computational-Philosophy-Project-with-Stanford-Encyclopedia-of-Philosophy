Turing\nchose to emphasize this when explaining these electronic machines in a\nmanner suitable for an audience of uninitiates:\n\n\nThe idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that\nthese machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be\ndone by a human computer. (Turing 1950a [2004: 444])\n\n\nHe made the point a little more precisely in the technical document\ncontaining his design for the ACE:\n\n\nThe class of problems capable of solution by the machine [the ACE] can\nbe defined fairly specifically. They are [a subset of] those problems\nwhich can be solved by human clerical labour, working to fixed rules,\nand without understanding. (Turing 1945 [2005: 386])\n\n\nTuring went on to characterize this subset in terms of the\namount of paper and time available to the human clerk.\n\nIt was presumably because he considered the point to be essential for\nunderstanding the nature of the new electronic machines that he chose\nto begin his Programmers\u2019 Handbook for Manchester Electronic\nComputer Mark II with this explanation:\n\n\nElectronic computers are intended to carry out any definite rule of\nthumb process which could have been done by a human operator working\nin a disciplined but unintelligent manner. (Turing c1950:\n1)\n\n\nIt was not some deficiency of imagination that led Turing to model his\nL.C.M.s on what could be achieved by a human computer. The\npurpose for which he invented the Turing machine demanded it. The\nEntscheidungsproblem is the problem of finding a humanly\nexecutable method of a certain sort, and, as was explained\nearlier, Turing\u2019s aim was to show that there is no such method\nin the case of the full first-order predicate calculus.\n",
