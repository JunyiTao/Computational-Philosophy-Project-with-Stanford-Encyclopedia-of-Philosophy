    "main_text": "Quantum Probabilities || Probabilistic models\n3.1 Probabilistic models\nA probabilistic model as used in classical physics and\nother sciences can be thought of as a triple \\((\\SC,\\EC,\\MC)\\),\na sample space \\(\\SC\\), an event algebra \\(\\EC\\) and\na probability measure \\(\\MC\\). When a die is rolled the sample\nspace \\(\\SC\\) consists of six mutually exclusive possibilities, one and\nonly one of which actually occurs. The event algebra can be set equal\nto the collection of all \\(2^6\\) subsets of \\(\\SC\\), including the empty\nset and \\(\\SC\\) itself; it forms a Boolean algebra under complements and\nintersections. Finally, \\(\\MC\\) assigns probabilities, real numbers\nbetween 0 and 1, to the different sets in \\(\\EC\\) according to certain\nrules. Again we need only consider the simplest situation in which\n\\(\\SC\\) is finite or countable, and a nonnegative number \\(p_j\\) is\nassigned to each \\(j\\in\\SC\\) in such a manner that \\(\\sum_j p_j = 1\\). The\nprobability for some \\(E\\in \\EC\\) is then given by the formula\n\\[\\Pr(E) = \\sum_{j\\in E} p_j.  \\label{eqn4}\\]\nNote that the mathematical rules of probability theory do not\nconstrain the choice of the \\(p_j\\), aside from the requirement that\nthey be nonnegative and sum to 1. It is up to the scientist\nconstructing the model to come up with appropriate values, which may\nbe done using a variety of considerations; among them pure guesswork,\nas well as carefully fitting parameters using results of previous\nexperiments.\n",
