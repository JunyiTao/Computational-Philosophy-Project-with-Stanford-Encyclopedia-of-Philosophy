This model is presupposed in many debates about\nmarkets. But there are reasons to think that it is insufficient, both\ndescriptively and normatively, for capturing today\u2019s\nrealities.\n\nThere is, first of all, the problem of markets having become global,\nwhereas the political framework is still largely based on nation\nstates. This can lead to enforcement deficits, but also puts pressure\non states to forego stricter regulations or higher taxation because\ncapital, especially financial capital, will leave the country and\nescape to so-called \u201ctax havens\u201d (Dietsch 2015). In recent\nyears, there has been increased interest in international\nmarkets: What distinguishes them from domestic markets; for example,\ndo the immense inequalities of power and the different institutional\nframeworks in different countries mean that they need to be\nconceptualized differently? How could they be regulated and\nsupplemented by other institutions in order to achieve more global\njustice? How could the community of states, or at least groups of\nstates, cooperate to achieve this? These questions are embedded in the\nwider debate about global justice (cf. e.g., Pogge 2002; Caney 2005;\nBrock 2009, see also Blake 2008). This debate turns, for example, on\ninstitutions such as the World Trade Organization that could enforce\ncertain standards on labor conditions (see. e.g., Barry/Reddy 2008),\nor on how the trade in natural resources could be embedded in\ninstitutions that prevent the \u201cresource curse\u201d that haunts\ncountries with rich natural resources but weak governance structures\n(see e.g., Wenar 2015). Such proposals ask how the institutions that\nstructure international markets could be changed in ways that make the\ngains from trade mutual and give everyone a fair share (see also James\n2005; Risse 2007; Kurjanska/Risse 2008; Christensen 2017).\n\nSecondly, problems of market failures and market instabilities seem to\nbe much more pervasive than has often been assumed, especially in\ncomplex, interrelated markets such as financial markets (cf. e.g.,\nMinsky 1986, esp. ch. 9; on financial markets in general see also\nHerzog 2017). This means that it is far more difficult for states to\nregulate them. It has to do with the role of psychological effects\nsuch as herding (cf. e.g., Akerlof and Shilling 2003) and maybe also\nwith massive imbalances of power within such markets, which are often\ncaused by asymmetries of information or barriers to market entry. The\nconsequences of regulatory changes are hard to predict when there are\nnonlinear causal chains and the reaction of \u201cthe markets\u201d\nis difficult to anticipate, so that it is unclear how to evaluate\ntheir impact on society. This raises the question of whether states\nhave to use a more flexible approach to regulating markets, or whether\nthere might be ways of reducing the fragility of the global economic\nsystem.\n\nA third ground on which the dichotomy between \u201cthe market\u201d\nand \u201cthe state\u201d has been criticized is that it obfuscates\nthe influence of powerful economic agents, e.g., large-scale\ncorporations, on political decision-making. As some authors have\nargued, some capitalist countries, notably the United States, are\ncoming close to a situation in which it is not the state that\nregulates markets. Rather powerful agents among both the corporate and\nthe political elites set the rules of the game to their own advantage,\nat the costs of society at large (e.g., Crouch 2011).\n\nAll these points are particularly urgent because the problems of\nlimited natural resources and climate change raise issues about the\nability of the market-cum-political-framework as we know it to steer\ntowards a more sustainable path. Because many of the activities that\nharm the natural environment take place as market activities,\nregulating them will often require a regulation of markets. Given how\ndifficult it is to establish such a regulatory framework on a global\nscale, however, voluntary action by individual market participants\nalso seems to be called for, e.g., by buying sustainably grown\nproducts and cars with a low carbon emission. Such voluntary actions\nshould, ideally, create incentives for companies to find innovative\nsolutions to reduce resource consumption and energy consumption (cf.\nalso 5.2 below). Although they are certainly part of the problem,\nmarkets might then also be part of the solution to the challenges\nraised by poverty, resource depletion, and climate change.\n",
