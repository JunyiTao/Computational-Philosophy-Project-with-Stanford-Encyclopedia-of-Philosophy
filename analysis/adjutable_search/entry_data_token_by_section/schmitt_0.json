    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nCarl Schmitt\u2019s early career as an academic lawyer falls into the last\nyears of the Wilhelmine Empire. (See for Schmitt\u2019s life and career:\nBendersky 1983; Balakrishnan 2000; Mehring 2009.) But Schmitt wrote\nhis most influential works, as a young professor of\nconstitutional law in Bonn and later in Berlin, during the\nWeimar-period: Political Theology, presenting Schmitt\u2019s\ntheory of sovereignty, appeared in 1922, to be followed in 1923 by The\nCrisis of Parliamentary Democracy, which attacked the\nlegitimacy of parliamentary government. In 1927, Schmitt published the\nfirst version of his most famous work, The Concept of the\nPolitical, defending the view that all true politics is based on\nthe distinction between friend and enemy. The culmination of Schmitt\u2019s\nwork in the Weimar period, and arguably his greatest achievement, is\nthe 1928 Constitutional Theory, which systematically applied\nSchmitt\u2019s political theory to the interpretation of the Weimar\nconstitution. During the political and constitutional crisis of the\nlater Weimar Republic Schmitt published Legality and\nLegitimacy, a clear-sighted analysis of the breakdown of\nparliamentary government in Germany, as well as The Guardian of the\nConstitution, which argued that the president as the head of the\nexecutive, and not a constitutional court, ought to be recognized as\nthe guardian of the constitution. In these works from the later Weimar\nperiod, Schmitt\u2019s declared aim to defend the Weimar constitution is at\ntimes barely distinguishable from a call for constitutional revision\ntowards a more authoritarian political framework (Dyzenhaus 1997,\n70\u201385; Berthold 1999; Kennedy 2004, 154\u201378; Breuer 2012).\n\n\nThough Schmitt had not been a supporter of National Socialism before\nHitler came to power, he sided with the Nazis after 1933. Schmitt\nquickly obtained an influential position in the legal profession and\ncame to be perceived as the \u2018Crown Jurist\u2019 of National\nSocialism.  (R\u00fcthers 1990; Mehring 2009, 304\u2013436) He\ndevoted himself, with undue enthusiasm, to such tasks as the defence\nof Hitler\u2019s extra-judicial killings of political opponents (PB\n227\u201332) and the purging of German jurisprudence of Jewish\ninfluence (Gross 2007; Mehring 2009, 358\u201380). But Schmitt was\nousted from his position of power within legal academia in 1936, after\ninfighting with academic competitors who viewed Schmitt as a turncoat\nwho had converted to Nazism only to advance his career. There is\nconsiderable debate about the causes of Schmitt\u2019s willingness to\nassociate himself with the Nazis. Some authors point to Schmitt\u2019s\nstrong ambition and his opportunistic character but deny ideological\naffinity (Bendersky 1983, 195\u2013242; Schwab 1989). But a strong\ncase has been made that Schmitt\u2019s anti-liberal jurisprudence, as well\nas his fervent anti-semitism, disposed him to support the Nazi regime\n(Dyzenhaus 1997, 85\u2013101; Scheuerman 1999). Throughout the later\nNazi period, Schmitt\u2019s work focused on questions of international law.\nThe immediate motivation for this turn seems to have been the aim to\njustify Nazi-expansionism. But Schmitt was interested in the wider\nquestion of the foundations of international law, and he was convinced\nthat the turn towards liberal cosmopolitanism in 20th century\ninternational law would undermine the conditions of stable and\nlegitimate international legal order. Schmitt\u2019s theoretical work on\nthe foundations of international law culminated in The Nomos of\nthe Earth, written in the early 1940\u2019s, but not published before\n1950. Due to his support for and involvement with the Nazi\ndictatorship, Schmitt was briefly detained and interrogated at the end\nof the war as a potential defendant in the Nuremberg trials (ECS; AN),\nthe legitimacy of which he impugned in a legal brief prepared for the\ndefense of the German industrialist Friedrich Flick (IC). The\nobstinately unrepentant Schmitt was not allowed to return to an\nacademic job after 1945 (Mehring 2009, 438\u201363). But he\nnevertheless remained an important figure in West Germany\u2019s\nconservative intellectual scene to his death in 1985 (van Laak 2002)\nand enjoyed a considerable degree of clandestine influence elsewhere\n(Scheuerman 1999, 183\u2013251; M\u00fcller 2003).\n Unsurprisingly, the significance and value of Schmitt\u2019s works is\nsubject to heated controversy (Caldwell 2005). A group of authors\nsympathetic to Schmitt argue that Schmitt\u2019s analysis of liberal\nconstitutionalism during the Weimar period is separable from his\nsupport for National Socialism and that it constitutes an insightful\nand important analysis of the political presuppositions of a\nwell-functioning liberal constitutional system (Bendersky 1983; Schwab\n1989; Gottfried 1990; Kennedy 2004; Schupmann 2017). From the left, Schmitt\u2019s work is\nsometimes taken to illustrate the affinities between a purely economic\nliberalism and political authoritarianism (Mauss 1980; Cristi 1998).\nThe view that the Schmitt of the Weimar period can be read as a\ndefender of liberal order has been questioned by authors who stress\nthe continuity between Schmitt\u2019s conceptions of law, sovereignty, and\ndemocracy and fascist ideology (Wolin 1992; Dyzenhaus 1997; Scheuerman\n1999). However, engagement with Schmitt is nevertheless considered to\nbe important. It has been argued that Rawlsian political liberalism is\nvulnerable to Schmitt\u2019s critique of liberalism due to its\nunwillingness to base itself explicitly on a liberal conception of the\ngood (Dyzenhaus 1997, 218\u201358) or due to its refusal to recognize\nthe antagonistic nature of politics (Mouffe 1999b). Moreover,\nSchmitt\u2019s views on sovereignty and emergency powers are often seen as\nthe intellectual basis of contemporary calls for a strong executive\npower unhampered by constraints of legality (Dyzenhaus 2006,\n35\u201354; Scheuerman 2006; Posner and Vermeule 2010,\n3\u201324). Finally, there are an increasing number of authors who\nconcentrate on particular arguments of Schmitt\u2019s that are seen as\nworth developing in a systematic context. Two focal points of recent\ninterest are Schmitt\u2019s theory of popular sovereignty (Arato 1995;\nLindahl 2007; Kalyvas 2008, 79\u2013186; Loughlin 2010, 209\u201337;\nKahn 2011; Colon-Rios 2012, 79\u2013101; Minkkinen 2013; Vinx 2013a)\nand his conception of international order (Odysseos and Petito 2007;\nSlomp 2009; Legg 2011; Benhabib, 2012; Vinx 2013b; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017, chapter 10).\n",
