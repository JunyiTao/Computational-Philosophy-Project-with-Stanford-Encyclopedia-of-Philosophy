    "main_text": "Knowledge-How and Skill || Skill Across Cultures\n9.1 Skill Across Cultures\n\nThe most recent debate on knowledge-how has intertwined with a debate\non the nature of skills. While there is no consensus on what counts as\na skill, by and large people take skills to manifest in purposeful and\ngoal-directed activities and to be learnable and improvable through\npractice (Fitts & Posner 1967; Stanley & Krakauer 2013;\nWillingham 1998; Yarrow, Brown, & Krakauer 2009). Skills are\nusually contrasted with knacks (or mere talents). Some\ncontrast them with habits (Pear 1926; Ryle 1949) in that these are\nperformed automatically, whereas the exercise of intelligent\ncapacities involves self-control, attention to the conditions, and\nawareness of the task. Others, instead, argue that understanding skill\nrequires a better understanding of what habits amount to (Gallagher\n2017; Hutto & Robertson 2020).\n\nThe topic of skill and expertise is central since ancient philosophy\nthrough the notion of techn\u0113. Although both Plato and\nAristotle took techn\u0113 to be a kind of knowledge, there\nis significant controversy about their conceptions regarding the\nnature of this kind of knowledge and its relation to experience\n(empeiria) on one hand, and scientific knowledge\n(epist\u0113m\u0113) on the other (Johansen 2017; Lorenz\n& Morison 2019; Coope 2020). Annas (1995, 2001, 2011) develops an\ninterpretation on which skill and virtue (or phron\u0113sis)\nare closer in Aristotle\u2019s action theory than usually thought and\nthey are both conceived along a broadly intellectualist model. \n\nIn contemporary times, the notion of skill is central to the\nphilosophy of the twentieth-century French phenomenologist Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty. Merleau-Ponty (1945 [1962]) distinguishes between\nmotor intentionality\u2014the sort of intentionality\nrelevant for motor skills\u2014and cognitive intentionality.\nWhile the latter is conceptual and representational, Merleau-Ponty\nthought that motor intentionality is non-representational and\nnon-conceptual. Central to Merleau-Ponty is the role of motor skills\nin shaping perceptual experience: in paradigmatic cases of perception,\nthe flow of information taken in by perceivers is inseparable from the\nway they move through a scene. On this view, even superficially static\nperceptions engage motor skills, such as seeing the color of a table\nas uniform when different parts of it are differently illuminated (see\nSiegel 2020 for an helpful introduction).\n\nThis phenomenological tradition inspires Dreyfus\u2019 (1991, 2000,\n2002, 2005, 2007) critique of standard action theory. According to\nDreyfus, theories on which an action is intentional only if the agent\nis in a mental state that represents the goal of her action (cf.\nSearle 1980, 2001) or on which actions are permeated by conceptual\nrationality (cf. McDowell 2007) are not supported by the phenomenology\nof purposive activity. Paradigmatic examples of these purposive\nactivities are, for Dreyfus, skillful activities like playing tennis\nor habitual activity like rolling over in bed or making gestures while\nspeaking. In this sort of skillful coping, Dreyfus thought that the\nmind does not represent the world as detached from it. Rather, it is\nfundamentally embedded, absorbed, and embodied (see Gehrman &\nSchwenkler 2020 for an helpful introduction to Dreyfus on skills).\n\n\nThe notion of skill is central also in Eastern philosophy. Garfield\nand Priest (2020) examine the various roles that the notion of skill\nplays in the Indian school of Mahayana Buddhism, in Daoism, and in\nChan/Zen thought. In Daoism as well as in Chan/Zen Buddhism, the\nemphasis on skill is also connected, fundamentally, to concerns about\nliving a good and ethical life. Sarkissan (2020) argues that two\nprominent types of expertise often encountered in ancient Chinese\nthought from the sixth to third centuries BCE: The first is expertise\nat a particular craft, occupation, or dao, as is most\nfamously presented in the Daoist anthology Zhuangzi. The\nsecond is ethical expertise in the Ruist (Confucian) and Mohist\nschools (cf. for more on skill in Buddhism, see also MacKenzie\n2020).\n",
