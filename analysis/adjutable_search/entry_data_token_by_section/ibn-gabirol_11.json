For Plato, participation is in a form, and a highest\nform\u2014participated in by all\u2014is the form of being. For\nthe Neoplatonist, as for Ibn Gabirol, the focus on the form is replaced\n(or amplified) by the focus on the Universal Intellect that contains\nall forms (simultaneously, in potency, as one nested in the next).\nImagine the conceptual implication of this Neoplatonic focus on\nIntellect (versus a Platonic focus on the form of being) for a\nparticipation theory\u2014if we think of it carefully, we will find\nthat the Neoplatonic model can quite organically gives rise to the kind\nof hylomorphic focus we find in Ibn Gabirol: In a Neoplatonic\nIntellect, all the forms are \u201cin\u201d Intellect, a notion which\ncan easily be seen as emphasizing Intellect's material role as\nsustainer. This would mean that the move from Platonic talk of forms to\nNeoplatonic talk of Intellect organically invites a new focus on the\nrole of [spiritual] matter (viz. the matter of Intellect by which it\nreceives or holds all the forms). This immediately transforms the\nPlatonic concept of participating in form/s to the concept of\nparticipating in matter (the receiver) (or, we might say, participating\nin matter as the means to participating in forms). And so, whereas for\nPlato all things participate in the form of being, for Ibn Gabirol, all\nthings are grounded in / have as their underlying \u201ctrue\nsubstrate\u201d the substance of Intellect which is to say, they\nparticipate in matter (viz. the spiritual matter of pure intellect)\nplus forms.\n",
