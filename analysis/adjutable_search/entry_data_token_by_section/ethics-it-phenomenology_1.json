    "main_text": "Views on the Nature of Information Technology || Information Technology as an Artifact or Tool\n1.1 Information Technology as an Artifact or Tool\n\nThe most common view of information technology is that it is an\nartifact or tool simply available, to use of not to use, in order for\nhumans to achieve their objectives and outcomes. Some of these tools\nmight be very useful and others not. When users (and the term\n\u2018user\u2019 here is important) take up a tool or artifact (word\nprocessor, mobile phone, etc) it will tend to have an impact on the\nway they do things. For example if I write with a word processor I\nwould tend to have different writing practices than I would with pen\nand paper\u2014for example, with the \u2018cutting and\npasting\u2019function of a word processor I can simply type out my\nideas and then reorder them later without being preoccupied with the\ncomposition of the whole from the start. Thus, tools function as\nextensions of human capabilities, allowing us to achieve what we can\nnot achieve with the body alone\u2014and one might add that some\ntools are more \u2018extensive\u2019 than others as our pen vs. word\nprocessor suggest. According to this view, we need to understand the\nimpact that the use of the tools (information technology in this case)\nhas on human society as they are taken up and used in everyday\npractices. For example, how will communication with mobile phones\nchange our social interaction and social relationships? In asking such\na question this view does not primarily concern itself with the\ndevelopment of the technology\u2014why and how did it come about in\nthe first instance. It mostly assumes that the design of a particular\ntechnology is rational and objective; one might call it an engineering\nor scientific solution to a particular problem. It also mostly assumes\nthat the particular technology\u2014mobile phones in this\ncase\u2014operates in a more or less uniform manner in different\nsocial practices and settings. In other words, it assumes that a\nparticular technology has certain determinate effects on, or in, the\ncontext of its use. This way of conceptualizing information technology\nleads to questions such as \u201cwhat is the impact of the mobile\nphone on communication patterns\u201d or \u201cwhat is the impact of\nmobile phones on privacy/privacy expectations\u201d. This view of\ntechnology is often criticized for a greater or lesser degree of\ntechnological determinism. Technological determinism is the view that\ntechnology more or less causes certain ways of doing or ways of\norganizing to come about. For example, a technological determinist may\nargue that the Internet\u2019s open and non-hierarchical architecture\ncan more or less cause a society that uses it to become more\nopen and less hierarchical. The work of Postman (1993) is an example\nof this type of critical evaluation of the impact of technology on\nsociety.\n",
