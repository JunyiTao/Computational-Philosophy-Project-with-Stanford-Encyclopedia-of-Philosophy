    "main_text": "\n\nNormative democratic theory deals with the moral foundations of\ndemocracy and democratic institutions, as well as the moral duties of\ndemocratic representatives and citizens. It is distinct from\ndescriptive and explanatory democratic theory, which aim to describe\nand explain how democracy and democratic institutions function.\nNormative democracy theory aims to provide an account of when and why\ndemocracy is morally desirable as well as moral principles for guiding\nthe design of democratic institutions and the actions of citizens and\nrepresentatives. Of course, normative democratic theory is inherently\ninterdisciplinary and must draw on the results of political science,\nsociology, psychology, and economics in order to give concrete moral\nguidance.\n\nThis brief outline of normative democratic theory focuses attention on\nseven related issues. First, it proposes a definition of democracy.\nSecond, it outlines different approaches to the question of why\ndemocracy is morally valuable at all. Third, it\ndiscusses the issue of whether and when democratic institutions have\nauthority and different conceptions of the limits of democratic\nauthority. Fourth, it explores the question\nof what it is reasonable to demand of citizens in large democratic\nsocieties. This issue is central to the evaluation of normative\ndemocratic theories. A large body of opinion has it that most\nclassical normative democratic theory is incompatible with what we can\nreasonably expect from citizens. Fifth, it surveys different accounts\nof the proper characterization of equality in the processes of\nrepresentation and the moral norms of representation. Sixth, it discusses\nthe relationship between central findings in social choice theory and\ndemocracy. Seventh, it discusses the question of who should be included\nin the group that makes democratic decisions. \n",
