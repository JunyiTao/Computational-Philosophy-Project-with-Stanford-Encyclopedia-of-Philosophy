Moore\u2019s theory is wrong since it presupposes\nnon-existent non-natural properties of goodness and badness. But if\nnaturalism is not an option, that still leaves two\nalternatives\u2014some kind of non-cognitivism or an error-theory\n (see \u00a71).\n Russell\u2019s dominant view was to be a form of emotivism, and hence of\nnon-cognitivism. But although emotivism was Russell\u2019s dominant view\nfrom 1913 onwards, there were two significant wobbles. In 1922 he\nproposed a version of the error theory, anticipating J. L. Mackie by\nover twenty years. And in 1954 in Human Society in Ethics and\nPolitics, he endeavored to inject a little objectivity into\nethics by developing a form of naturalism. The first wobble is more\ninteresting than the second, but neither should be neglected in an\naccount of Russell\u2019s ethics, even though Russell abandoned the theory\nof HSEP within weeks of publication, reverting to the\nemotivism of 1935.\n",
