    "main_text": "Metaphysical Arguments from Moral Disagreement || Disagreement and Inaccessibility\n3.2 Disagreement and Inaccessibility\n\n\nOf course, the role such a reconstruction of Mackie\u2019s argument\nassigns to moral disagreement is exceedingly limited, so it hardly\naccounts for the attention that moral disagreement has received in the\ndebate about moral realism. Can the argument be reconstructed in a more\ndirect way? As several commentators have pointed out, what might be\nneeded is an epistemic premise (e.g., Bennigson 1996; Loeb 1998;\nTersman 2006, ch. 3, Enoch 2009; and Locke 2017). The question is what\nthe existence of moral facts predicts about existing moral\ndisagreement, and the problem is that it is hard to see how it\ngenerates any such predictions on its own. Further assumptions are\nneeded, and one candidate is the idea that the facts, if they exist,\nare accessible to us in the sense that we can in favorable epistemic\ncircumstances acquire knowledge of them. David Wiggins has formulated\nthe idea as follows: \u201cIf X is true, then X will under favourable\ncircumstances command convergence\u201d (1987, 147). Given such a\nclaim, one could then argue that moral realism predicts less\ndisagreement (in the relevant circumstances) than that which actually\nexists. This would be a direct reason to reject it.\n\n\nThis alternative construal of the argument leaves realists with the\noption of denying that the moral facts they posit are accessible.\nHowever, that is a move realists are typically not inclined to make. A\npersuasive argument to the effect that moral realists are committed to\nviewing moral facts as inaccessible would rather be seen as an\nembarrassment, as it would leave them, to use Russ\nShafer-Landau\u2019s phrase, with \u201ca logically coherent position\nthat contains about zero appeal\u201d. (2012, 1). Indeed, some\nrealists even make the claim that moral facts are epistemically\naccessible a part of their definition of the position (Boyd 1988, 182).\nA more common response is therefore to try to find ways to reconcile\nthe existing disagreement both with the existence and with the\naccessibility of moral facts.\n\n\nThe prospects of such a response depend on what the accessibility is\ntaken to entail. There may be little reason for realists to go beyond\nthe relatively modest claim that we can attain knowledge of some moral\nfacts in favorable circumstances. Given such a weak interpretation of\n\u201caccessible\u201d, realists may employ all the strategies\noutlined in section 1.3 to argue that most of the existing disagreement\noccurs between persons who are not in ideal circumstances which would\nrender it irrelevant in the present context. After all, the fact that\npeople have failed to reach agreement (which entails, on a realist\nview, that some have failed to obtain knowledge) in conditions that are\nnot favorable need not show that they would fail also in\ncircumstances that are. As for the remaining disagreement,\nsuch as that between philosophers, realists could point out that it\nprimarily concerns highly general and theoretical facts whose\naccessibility they can consistently remain agnostic about, for example\ndue to underdetermination concerns.\n\n\nIn addition, realists may in fact concede that some contested moral\nissues do not allow for objectively correct answers and thus grant some\namount of indeterminacy in the moral realm. The idea is that they may\ndo so and still insist that other moral questions have such answers, by\nattributing the indeterminacy to vagueness which in turn may be the\nresult of the applicability of incommensurable values or requirements\n(see, e.g., Brink 1989, 202; Sturgeon 1994, 95; and Shafer-Landau 1994\nand 1995). That proposal has received some attention (e.g.,\nConstantinescu 2012 and 2014) and deserves further examination.\nHowever, a potential concern with it is that the set of moral issues\nwhich may most plausibly be taken to involve vagueness might not\noverlap so well with the set of issues over which there is the fiercest\ndisagreement among competent inquirers (for this point, see Loeb 1998,\n290; Tersman 2006, 133; and Schroeter and Schroeter 2013, 7\u20138).\nWouldn\u2019t such inquirers be likely to spot the indeterminacy and\nabstain from forming any (conflicting) beliefs about those issues? If\nso, then the appeal to vagueness provides just limited help to realists\nin accommodating the most likely candidates for qualifying as radical\nmoral disagreements.\n",
