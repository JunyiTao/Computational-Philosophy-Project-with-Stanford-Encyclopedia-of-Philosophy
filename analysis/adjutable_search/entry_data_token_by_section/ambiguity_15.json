    "main_text": "Detecting Ambiguity || Definitional Tests\n4.4 Definitional Tests\n\nAristotle offers a test for ambiguity: try to construct a definition\nthat encompasses both meanings and posit an ambiguity only if you\nfail. The notion of definition here has to be taken as a heavy-weight\nnotion: \u2018bank\u2019 is ambiguous even though you can\n\u2018define\u2019 it as \u2018financial institution or river\nside\u2019. However, we can get a reasonable grip on what Aristotle\nhad in mind. \u2018Uncle\u2019 is not ambiguous because it has a\nsingle definition that covers both: x is an uncle iff\nx is the brother of y and y has a\nchild. \n\nThe test depends partly on how strict we are about what counts as a\ndefinition. And on the assumption that there are interesting\ndefinitions to be had (see Fodor 1998).\n",
