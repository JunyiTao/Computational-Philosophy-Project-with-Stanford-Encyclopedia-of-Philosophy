    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning for Life: the Evidence || Fine-Tuning in Biology\n1.3 Fine-Tuning in Biology\n\nBiological organisms are fine-tuned for life in the sense that their\nability to solve problems of survival and reproduction depends\ncrucially and sensitively on specific details of their behaviour and\nphysiology. For example, many animals rely on their visual apparatus\nto spot prey, predators, or potential mates. The proper functioning of\ntheir visual apparatus, in turn, depends sensitively on physiological\ndetails of their eyes and brain.\n\nBiological fine-tuning has a long tradition of being regarded as\nevidence for divine design (Paley 1802), but modern biology regards it\nas the product of Darwinian evolution, notably as driven by natural\nand sexual selection. Relatively recently, some researchers have\nclaimed that some specific \u201cfine-tuned\u201d features of\norganisms cannot possibly be the outcomes of Darwinian evolutionary\ndevelopment alone and that interventions by some designer must be\ninvoked to account for them. For example, Michael Behe (1996) claims\nthat the so-called flagellum, a bacterial organ that enables\nmotion, is irreducibly complex in the sense that it cannot be\nthe outcome of consecutive small-scale individual evolutionary steps,\nas they are allowed by standard, Darwinian, evolutionary theory. In a\nsimilar vein, William Dembski (1998) argues that some evolutionary\nsteps hypothesized by Darwinian are so improbable that one would not\nrationally expect them to occur even once in a volume the size of the\nvisible universe. Behe and Dembski conclude that an intelligent\ndesigner likely intervened in the evolutionary course of events.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus in modern biology is that the challenges to\nDarwinian evolutionary theory brought forward by Behe, Dembski and\nothers can be met. According to Kenneth Miller (1999), Behe\u2019s\narguments fail to establish that there are no plausible small-step\nevolutionary paths which have Behe\u2019s allegedly\n\u201cirreducibly complex\u201d features as outcomes. For example,\nas Miller argues, there is in fact strong evidence for a Darwinian\nevolutionary history of the flagellum and its constituents (Miller\n1999: 147\u2013148).\n",
