    "main_text": "Critics of Children\u2019s Rights\n2. Critics of Children\u2019s Rights\n\nGrant that on either account of what it is to have a right children\ncould, in principle, be the holders of rights. Ought children to have\nrights? And, if so, what rights should they have? Note that the rights\ncan be moral or legal. Children do have rights in law (under the UN\nConvention most notably). These need not be accepted as moral rights.\nHowever, someone could believe that the best way, on balance, to\nprotect the interests of children is by continuing to accord them the\nlegal rights they have under something like the Convention. Someone\nmight also believe that children should have legal rights but not\nthose they are currently accorded. Conversely, if children do have\nmoral rights, these need not be enshrined in law, although there would\nevidently be a strong presumption that they should. In the first\ninstance, the question is whether children should have moral rights.\nIf they should, then there would be a good case for thinking that\nthese should be legally protected rights.\n\nThose who claim that children should have all the rights that adults\npresently have are called \u2018liberationists\u2019 (to be\ndiscussed in the next section) and include Holt, Farson and Cohen\n(Farson 1974; Holt 1975; Cohen 1980). We can distinguish real from\nrhetorical liberationists. The latter are those who see the demand for\nequal rights for children as a means both of drawing attention to the\ndiscrimination that children suffer by comparison with adults in their\ntreatment and for improving their condition. A rhetorical\nliberationist does not actually believe that children should be the\nequals of adults. Rather, he thinks that claiming as much is the best\nway of advancing their interests. A real liberationist does view\nchildren as the equals of adults. Then there are those who think that\nchildren should have some but not all of the rights which adults have.\nFinally, there are those who think that children should not have any\nrights. Or, put less brusquely, they are sceptical, for theoretical\nand political reasons, about attributing rights to children. Their\ncase is made in three ways. The first is to assert what liberationists\ndeny, namely that children are not qualified, as adults are, to have\nrights. The second is to argue that the ascription of rights to\nchildren is inappropriate because it displays a misunderstanding of\nwhat childhood is, what children are like, or what relationships\nchildren stand in to adults. The third is to argue that,\nnotwithstanding their lack of rights, children can be assured of\nadequate moral protection by other means.\n\nWith respect to the first claim, the question of qualification is the question of whether children have the requisite capacity for\nrights. On the will theory of rights the relevant capacity qualifying\nchildren for possession of rights is that of the ability to choose.\nBut there is a more general issue of capacity that is in dispute\nwhatever theory of rights is defended and that follows from attention\nto the fact that rights have a content. Each right is a right to do,\nto be, or to have something. Arguably, only those rights can be\npossessed whose content can be appropriately attributed to their\nowners. A right to free speech cannot properly be possessed by an\nentity incapable of speech. One conventional way to think of rights in\nterms of their content is to distinguish between freedom rights\n(rights to choose, such as to vote, practise a religion, and to\nassociate) and welfare rights (rights that protect important interests\nsuch as health).\n\nChildren in general lack certain cognitive abilities\u2014to acquire\nand to process information in an ordered fashion, to form consistent\nand stable beliefs, to appreciate the significance of options and\ntheir consequences. They also lack certain volitional\nabilities\u2014to form, retain and act in the light of consistent\ndesires, and to make independent choices. Children are not unique amongst\nhumans in this respect. Those adults who are seriously mentally\nimpaired are also disqualified in this sense, which is of course just\nto say that these adults are childlike. Children are unique in the\nfollowing regard. Not all humans are seriously mentally impaired, but\nall humans were once children. Thus every one of us was, during our\nearly years, not qualified to be a holder of rights even if now we are\nso qualified.\n\nIt is worth distinguishing \u2013 as Schapiro (1999, 2003) does\n\u2013 between two ways in which a child is, relative to an adult,\nincapable. Schapiro argues that childhood is a \u2018normative\npredicament\u2019 wherein the child is in a state of nature, lacking\nany independent will whereby she might authoritatively and in her own\nvoice order her desires. She is an \u2018instinctual wanton\u2019.\nOn her account, the capacities a child lacks are not those of making\ngood choices, but those of making any choices as such.\n\nA child\u2019s incapacity, in the senses indicated above, would seem\nto disqualify them from having liberty rights. Someone incapable of\nchoosing cannot have a right whose content is a fundamental choice.\nIf, as some maintain, all human rights are best interpreted as\nprotecting human agency and its preconditions, then it would follow\nthat those incapable of agency, such as young children, should not be\naccorded human rights (Griffin 2002). On the other hand, it could be\nmaintained that, whilst children lack agency, they certainly have\nfundamental interests meriting protection and thus at least have\nwelfare rights (Brighouse 2002). Moreover, it can be important to\nrecognise that children become beings capable of making choices and\nthat rights may be attributed in recognition of this gradual\ndevelopment (Brennan 2002).\n\nThe second claim that may be made in denying rights to children is\nthat the ascription of rights to children is inappropriate because it\ndisplays a misunderstanding of what childhood is, of what children are\nlike, or of what relationships children do or ought to stand in to\nadults. This claim comes in various forms.\n\nOn one view we should start our thinking about what morally we owe\nto children by specifying our obligations as adults to them\n(O\u2019Neill 1988). There certainly exist what are called perfect\nobligations. These are obligations that are either owed to all\nchildren or to some specified set of children. They are perfect in\nthat it is completely specified whom they are owed to and what is owed\nto them. We all are obliged not to maltreat any child, and parents\nhave a particular duty to care for their children. But then there are\nimperfect obligations which are those of caring for children to whom\nwe do not, as parents for instance, have specific obligations. All\nadults owe these, but they are not owed to all children (how could\nthey possibly be?) nor is it specified what precisely is owed to\nthem. The obligations are imperfect because which children we should\ncare for is not specified nor is it specified precisely what is owed\nto them. Both are left to individual discretion, depending in part on\ncircumstances. \n\nPerhaps then we can agree that we are all under a duty to prevent the\nabuse of children. But clearly we cannot, as individuals, each act to\nstop every child being abused. Moreover what we ought to do\u2014for\ninstance, by reporting suspected cases of abuse\u2014will depend on\nthe circumstances, and also on what is in place by way of particular\ninstitutions and laws to deal with child abuse.\n\nCrucially whilst perfect obligations correlate with rights, imperfect\nobligations do not. This means that anyone who starts and finishes\nthinking about what morally is owed to children in terms of their\nrights is unable to capture what imperfect obligations express. Yet\nthis is to miss much of what is most important about the way in which,\nmorally, we should as adults stand in relation to children. For the\nfulfilment of these imperfect duties of care and concern is what\ncentrally protects and promotes the lives of children as children.\nThinking ethically about children\u2019s lives in terms of their\nputative rights is to misperceive what is of central importance and\nvalue in these lives.\n\nOne possible response to O\u2019Neill\u2019s argument is as follows\n(Coady 1992). She does not deny that perfect obligations correlate\nwith rights. Thus, to the extent that we do have perfect obligations\nto children, they do have corresponding rights. Yet O\u2019Neill\ndenies that imperfect obligations correlate with rights. But why\nshould we think that? The imperfect obligations are fundamental ones.\nThey are not supererogatory, that is beyond duty. Adults must show\nconsideration and kindness to children in general. So why cannot\nchildren claim such kindness and consideration from adults as their\nright? O\u2019Neill does say that when imperfect obligations are\ninstitutionalised\u2014when, for instance there are laws and\ninstitutions specifying who should act and how to detect and prevent\nchild abuse\u2014there are created positive special obligations to\nwhich correspond positive rights. But she adds that the obligations\nof, say, the social worker exceed the positive obligations associated\nwith her job. However this is true of all our obligations, whether\nperfect or imperfect. A parent can have positive, that is legally\nrecognised and sanctioned, duties to her child. Yet her perfect\nobligations to her children are not exhaustively specified by what the\nlaw requires of her.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s argument does not rely on any specification of\nthe content of the obligations that might be owed by adults to\nchildren. Rather it is about the structure of our moral reasoning in\nrespect of children, and the priority\u2014false in the\nargument\u2019s view\u2014that is given to rights. As an argument it\nthus bears some comparison with a view that expresses general\nscepticism about rights in the context of adult-child relations and\nwhich emphasises the particular character of the family (Schrag 1980;\nSchoeman 1980). This view draws attention to the quality and nature of\nthe relationships within a family. These are marked by an especial\nintimacy and by deep, unconditional love between its members. One can\ngrant that many families do not conform to this ideal and yet\nacknowledge that when the family does conform to the ideal it is a\ndistinctive, and distinctively valuable, form of human\nassociation.\n\nWhat arguably follows from this ideal of the family is the\ninappropriateness of asserting or claiming rights. For to do so would\nbe to subvert and ultimately destroy what constitutes the family as\nthe distinctive form of human association it is. Appeal is being made\nhere to a familiar and oft-drawn distinction between two ways in which\nindividuals engaged in a common enterprise or bound together in some\nenduring association can be assured of their beneficent, or at least\nminimally good, treatment of one another. One way is by the\nrecognition\u2014in law or custom or shared morality\u2014of rights\nthat all individuals can claim, or by rules of justice\u2014similarly\nand generally recognised\u2014which provide an assurance of fair\ntreatment. Another way is by reliance on the dispositions or attitudes\nthat the individuals bound together have\u2014spontaneously and\nnaturally\u2014towards one another. Thus, for instance, if each is\nmotivated by general benevolence in respect of all then no one has any\nneed to claim or assert what is due to him as of right or rule. In the\ncase of the family, it is argued, neither justice nor benevolence\nsuffices but love does. Of course children may have rights against\nthose who are not family members (a right, for instance, that their\nschool teachers provide them with information and skills). Some rights\nare held against particular individuals. Others, including the most\nimportant ones, are held against everyone, including parents and other\nfamily members\n\nA further and quite distinct allegation is that not only is there no\nneed for any such claims, but that allowing them to be made will\nerode, and in due course destroy, the dispositions and attitudes that\nrendered the need for rights and rules of justices unnecessary in the\nfirst place. This further claim is an influential one in the general\ncritique communitarianism makes, within political philosophy, of what\nis characterised as a rights-based and individualistic liberalism\n(see, for instance, Sandel 1982, 32\u20135). In the context of the\nfamily the claim is that granting its members rights will subvert and\nbring about the end of the love between them that made rights\nsuperfluous in the first place.\n\nThe arguments considered thus far have appealed to the role that\nrights generally do and should play in our moral lives. A further\nargument considers what would actually follow from granting rights to\nchildren (Purdy 1992). The argument is that we need as adults to have\nacquired certain traits of character if we are to be able to pursue\nour goals and lead a valuable life. To acquire these traits it is\nessential that we not be allowed as children to make our own choices.\nGranting children the liberty to exercise rights is destructive of the\npreconditions for the possibility of having fulfilling adult lives.\nThe central, and empirical, premise in this argument is that children\ndo not spontaneously and naturally grow into adults. They need to be\nnurtured, supported, and, more particularly, subjected to control and\ndiscipline. Without that context giving children the rights that\nadults have is bad for the children. It is also bad for the adults\nthey will turn into and for the society we share as adults and\nchildren.\n\nThe defence of the view that children should not, as the liberationist\nasserts, have all the rights that adults have has rested on the claims\nthat, first, children lack the capacities that qualify adults for the\npossession of rights, and, second, that talk of children\u2019s\nrights does not capture the truth about their lives or about the\nfamily or encourages a destructive permissiveness that has poor\nconsequences for adults and their society. The third step in defence\nof the denial of rights to children is to provide reassurance that\nsuch a denial is not bad for children.\n\nOne can thus maintain that rights do not exhaust the moral domain.\nThere are things we ought to do which do not correspond to the\nobligations we have as the correlates of rights. As adults we should\nprotect and promote the welfare of children. It need not follow that\nthey have rights against us.\n\nTo those who insist that children should, like other historically disadvantaged and discriminated groups, be emancipated by according them rights the reply\n(O\u2019Neill 1988, 459\u2013 463) is that such talk about rights\ntalk misses what is distinctively different about children as a group.\nThis is that childhood is not a permanently maintained status\nassociated with oppression or discrimination. It is rather a stage of\nhuman development which all go through. Moreover the adults who deny\nthat children do have rights may nevertheless also believe that it is\ntheir duty to ensure that the children for whom they have care do pass\nfrom childhood into adulthood.\n",
