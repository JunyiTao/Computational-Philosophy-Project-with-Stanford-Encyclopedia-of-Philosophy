Let\u2019s call\nthe proposition that a God of this sort exists\n\u201comni-theism\u201d. One interesting question, then, is how best\nto argue for atheism understood locally as the proposition that\nomni-theism is false.\n\nIt is often claimed that a good argument for atheism is impossible\nbecause, while it is at least possible to prove that something of a\ncertain sort exists, it is impossible to prove that nothing of that\nsort exists. One reason to reject this claim is that the descriptions\nof some kinds of objects are self-contradictory. For example, we can\nprove that no circular square exists because such an object would have\nto be both circular and non-circular, which is impossible. Thus, one\nway to argue for the nonexistence of the God of omni-theism (or\n\u201comni-God\u201d for short) is to argue that such a God is an\nimpossible object like a circular square.\n\nMany attempts have been made to construct such arguments. For example,\nit has been claimed that an omnibenevolent being would be impeccable\nand so incapable of wrongdoing, while an omnipotent being would be\nquite capable of doing things that would be wrong to do. There are,\nhowever, sophisticated and plausible replies to arguments like these.\nMore importantly, even if such an argument succeeded, omni-theists\ncould plausibly claim that, by \u201comnipotent\u201d, they mean,\nnot maximally powerful, but optimally powerful, where the optimal\ndegree of power may not be maximal if maximal power rules out\npossessing the optimal degree of some other perfection like moral\ngoodness.\n\nSimilar problems face attempts to show that omni-theism must be false\nbecause it is incompatible with certain known facts about the world.\nSuch arguments typically depend on detailed and contested\ninterpretations of divine attributes like omnibenevolence.\n\nA very different approach is based on the idea that disproof need not\nbe demonstrative. The goal of this approach is to show that the\nexistence of an omni-God is so improbable that confident belief in the\nnon-existence of such a God is justified. Two such arguments are\ndiscussed in detail below: the \u201clow priors argument\u201d and\nthe \u201cdecisive evidence argument\u201d. Each of these arguments\nemploys the same specific strategy, which is to argue that some\nalternative hypothesis to omni-theism is many times more probable than\nomni-theism. This doesn\u2019t imply that the alternative hypothesis\nis probably true, but it does imply that omni-theism is very probably\nfalse. In the case of the second argument, the alternative hypothesis\n(aesthetic deism) is arguably a form of theism, and even in the case\nof the first argument it is arguable that the alternative hypothesis\n(source physicalism) is compatible with some forms of theism (in\nparticular ones in which God is an emergent entity). This is not a\nproblem for either argument, however, precisely because both are\narguments for local atheism instead of global atheism.\n",
