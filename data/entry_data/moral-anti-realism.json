    "main_text": "\n1. Characterizing Moral Anti-realism\n\nTraditionally, to hold a realist position with respect to X\nis to hold that X exists objectively. On this view, moral\nanti-realism is the denial of the thesis that moral\nproperties\u2014or facts, objects, relations, events, etc. (whatever\ncategories one is willing to countenance)\u2014exist objectively.\nThis could involve either (1) the denial that moral properties exist\nat all, or (2) the acceptance that they do exist but this existence is\n(in the relevant sense) non-objective. There are broadly two ways of\nendorsing (1): moral noncognitivism and moral error theory. Proponents\nof (2) may be variously thought of as moral non-objectivists, or\nidealists, or constructivists. So understood, moral anti-realism is\nthe disjunction of three theses:\n\nmoral noncognitivism\nmoral error theory\nmoral non-objectivism\n\n\nUsing such labels is not a precise science, nor an uncontroversial\nmatter; here they are employed just to situate ourselves roughly. In\nthis spirit of preliminary imprecision, these views can be initially\ncharacterized as follows:\n\nMoral noncognitivism holds that our moral judgments\nare not in the business of aiming at truth. So, for example, A.J. Ayer\ndeclared that when we say \u201cStealing money is wrong\u201d we do\nnot express a proposition that can be true or false, but rather it is\nas if we say \u201cStealing money!!\u201d with the tone of\nvoice indicating that a special feeling of disapproval is being\nexpressed (Ayer [1936] 1971: 110). Note how the predicate\n\u201c\u2026 is wrong\u201d has disappeared in Ayer\u2019s\ntranslation schema; thus the issues of whether the property of\nwrongness exists, and whether that existence is objective, also\ndisappear.\n\nThe moral error theorist thinks that although our\nmoral judgments aim at the truth, they systematically fail to secure\nit: the world simply doesn\u2019t contain the relevant\n\u201cstuff\u201d to render our moral judgments true. For a more\nfamiliar analogy, compare what an atheist usually claims about\nreligious judgments. On the face of it, religious discourse is\ncognitivist in nature: it would seem that when someone says \u201cGod\nexists\u201d or \u201cGod loves you\u201d they are usually\nasserting something that purports to be true. However, according to\nthe atheist, the world isn\u2019t furnished with the right kind of\nstuff (gods, afterlife, miracles, etc.) necessary to render these\nassertions true. The moral error theorist claims that when we say\n\u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d we are asserting that the act\nof stealing instantiates the property of moral wrongness, but in fact\nthere is no such property, or at least nothing in the world\ninstantiates it, and thus the utterance is untrue.\n\nNon-objectivism (as it will be called here) allows\nthat moral facts exist but holds that they are non-objective. The\nslogan version comes from Hamlet: \u201cthere is nothing either good\nor bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d For a quick example of a\nnon-objective fact, consider the different properties that a\nparticular diamond might have. It is true that the diamond is made of\ncarbon, and also true that the diamond is worth $1000, say. But the\nstatus of these facts seems different. That the diamond is carbon\nseems an objective fact: it doesn\u2019t depend on what we think of\nthe matter. (We could all be under the impression that it is not\ncarbon, and all be wrong.) That the diamond is worth $1000, by\ncontrast, seems to depend on us. If we all thought that it was worth\nmore (or less), then it would be worth more (or less).\n\n[This entry uses the label \u201cnon-objectivism\u201d instead of\nthe simple \u201csubjectivism\u201d since there is an entrenched\nusage in metaethics for using the latter to denote the thesis that in\nmaking a moral judgment one is reporting (as opposed to expressing)\none\u2019s own mental attitudes (e.g., \u201cStealing is morally\nwrong\u201d means \u201cI disapprove of stealing\u201d). So\nunderstood, subjectivism is a kind of non-objectivist theory, but\nthere are many other kinds of non-objectivist theory, too.]\n\nIt is tempting to construe this idea of non-objectivity as\n\u201cmind-dependence,\u201d though this, as we will see below, is a\ntricky notion, since something may be mind-independent in one sense\nand mind-dependent in another. Cars, for example, are designed and\nconstructed by creatures with minds, and yet in another sense cars are\nclearly concrete entities whose ongoing existence does not depend on\nour mental activity. Those who feel pessimistic that the notion of\nmind-dependence can be straightened out might prefer to characterize\nmoral realism in a way that makes no reference to objectivity. There\nis also the concern that the objectivity clause threatens to render\nmoral anti-realism trivially true, since there is little room for\ndoubting that the moral status of actions usually (if not always)\ndepends in some manner on mental phenomena, such as the\nintentions with which the action was performed or the episodes of\npleasure and pain that ensue from it. (See Sayre-McCord 1986; also his\nthe entry on\n moral realism.)\n Whether such pessimism is warranted is not something to be decided\nhastily. Perhaps the judicious course is to make a terminological\ndistinction between minimal moral realism\u2014which is the\ndenial of noncognitivism and error theory\u2014and robust moral\nrealism\u2014which in addition asserts the objectivity of moral\nfacts. (See Rosen 1994 for this distinction.) In what follows,\nhowever, \u201cmoral realism\u201d will continue to be used to\ndenote the traditional robust version.\n\nIf moral anti-realism is understood in this manner, then there are\nseveral things with which it is important not to confuse it.\n\nFirst, moral anti-realism is not a form of moral\nskepticism. If we take moral skepticism to be the claim that\nthere is no such thing as moral knowledge, and we take knowledge to be\njustified true belief, then there are three ways of being a moral\nskeptic: one can deny that moral judgments are beliefs, one can deny\nthat moral judgments are ever true, or one can deny that moral\njudgments are ever justified. The noncognitivist makes the first of\nthese denials, and the error theorist makes the second, thus\nnoncognitivists and error theorists count as both moral anti-realists\nand moral skeptics. However, since the non-objectivity of some fact\ndoes not pose a particular problem regarding the possibility of\none\u2019s knowing it (I might know that a certain diamond is worth\n$1000, for example), then there is nothing to stop the moral\nnon-objectivist from accepting the existence of moral knowledge. So\nmoral non-objectivism is a form of moral anti-realism that need not be\na form of moral skepticism. Conversely, one might maintain that moral\njudgments are sometimes objectively true\u2014thus being a moral\nrealist\u2014while also maintaining that moral judgments always lack\njustification\u2014thus being a moral skeptic. (See entry for\n moral skepticism.)\n\nSpeaking more generally, moral anti-realism, as it has been defined\nhere, contains no epistemological clause: it is silent on the question\nof whether we are justified in making moral judgments. This is worth\nnoting since moral realists often want to support a view of morality\nthat would guarantee our justified access to a realm of objective\nmoral facts. But any such epistemic guarantee will need to be argued\nfor separately; it is not implied by realism itself. Indeed, if\nobjective facts are those that do not depend on our mental activity,\nthen they are precisely those facts that we can all be mistaken about,\nand thus it seems reasonable to suppose that the desire for moral\nfacts to be objective and the desire for a guarantee of epistemic\naccess to moral facts are desiderata that are in tension with each\nother.\n\nSecond, it is worth stating explicitly that moral anti-realism is not\na form of moral relativism\u2014or, perhaps more\nusefully noted: that moral relativism is not a form of moral\nanti-realism. Moral relativism is a form of cognitivism according to\nwhich moral claims contain an indexical element, such that the truth\nof any such claim requires relativization to some individual or group.\nAccording to a simple form of relativism, the claim \u201cStealing is\nmorally wrong\u201d might be true when one person utters it, and\nfalse when someone else utters it. The important thing to note is that\nthis would not necessarily make moral wrongness non-objective. For\nexample, suppose someone were to make the relativistic claim that\ndifferent moral values, virtues, and duties apply to different groups\nof people due to, say, their social caste. If this person were asked\nin virtue of what these relativistic moral facts obtain, there is\nnothing to prevent them offering the full-blooded realist answer:\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the way the universe objectively is.\u201d\nRelativism does not stand opposite objectivism; it stands opposite\nabsolutism (the form of cognitivism according to which the truth of\nmoral claims does not require relativization to any individual or\ngroup). One can be both a moral relativist and a moral objectivist\n(and thus a moral realist); conversely, one can be both a moral\nnon-objectivist (and thus a moral anti-realist) and a moral\nabsolutist. (See entries for\n relativism\n and\n moral relativism.)\n\nOf course, someone could simply stipulate that moral realism includes\nthe denial of moral relativism, and perhaps the philosophical\ncommunity could be persuaded to adopt this definition (in which case\nthis entry would need to be revised). But it seems reasonable to\nsuspect that the common tendency to think that moral realism and moral\nrelativism are opposed to each other is, more often than not, due a\nconfused conflation of the objectivism/non-objectivism distinction and\nthe absolutism/relativism distinction.\n\nThird and finally, it might be helpful to clarify the relationship\nbetween moral anti-realism and moral naturalism. The\nmoral naturalist believes that moral facts exist and fit within the\nworldview presented by science. (For example, a utilitarian view that\nidentifies moral obligation with the production of happiness will\ncount as a form of moral naturalism, since there is nothing\nparticularly scientifically mysterious about happiness.) A moral\nnaturalist may maintain that moral facts are objective in nature, in\nwhich case this moral naturalist will count as a moral realist. But a\nmoral naturalist may instead maintain that the moral facts are not\nobjective in nature, in which case this moral naturalist will count as\na moral anti-realist. Consider, for example, a simplistic\nnon-objectivist theory that identifies moral goodness (say) with\nwhatever a person approves of. Such a view would be a form of\nanti-realism (in virtue of its non-objectivism), but since the\nphenomenon of people approving of things is something that can be\naccommodated smoothly within a scientific framework, it would also be\na form of moral naturalism. Conversely, if a moral realist maintains\nthat the objective moral facts cannot be accommodated within the\nscientific worldview, then this moral realist will count as a moral\nnon-naturalist. (See entries for\n naturalism\n and\n moral naturalism.)\n\nThe noncognitivist and the error theorist, it should be noted, count\nas neither moral naturalists nor moral non-naturalists, since they do\nnot believe in moral facts at all. These kinds of moral anti-realist,\nhowever, may well be naturalists in a more general sense: they may\nmaintain that the only items that we should admit into our ontology\nare those that fit within the scientific worldview. Indeed, it is\nquite likely that it is their commitment to this more general\nontological naturalism that lies behind the noncognitivist\u2019s and\nthe error theorist\u2019s moral skepticism, since they may deem that\nmoral properties (were they to exist) would have to have\ncharacteristics that cannot be accommodated within a naturalistic\nframework.\n\nSumming up: Some moral anti-realists will count as moral skeptics, but\nsome may believe in moral knowledge. Some moral anti-realists will be\nrelativists, but some may be moral absolutists (and many are neither).\nSome moral anti-realists will be moral naturalists, but some may be\nmoral non-naturalists, and some will be neither moral naturalists nor\nnon-naturalists. These various positions can be combined into a\npotentially bewildering array of possible complex metaethical\npositions (e.g., non-skeptical, relativistic, non-naturalistic moral\nanti-realism)\u2014though, needless to say, these views may vary\ngreatly in plausibility.\n2. Who Bears the Burden of Proof?\n\nIt is widely assumed that moral realism enjoys some sort of\npresumption in its favor that the anti-realist has to work to\novercome. Jonathan Dancy writes that \u201cwe take moral value to be\npart of the fabric of the world; \u2026 and we should take it in the\nabsence of contrary considerations that actions and agents do have the\nsorts of moral properties we experience in them\u201d (1986: 172). In\na similar vein, David McNaughton claims \u201cThe realist\u2019s\ncontention is that he has only to rebut the arguments designed to\npersuade us that moral realism is philosophically untenable in order\nto have made out his case\u201d (1988: 40\u201341). David Brink\nconcurs: \u201cWe begin as (tacit) cognitivists and realists about\nethics.\u2026 Moral Realism should be our metaethical starting\npoint, and we should give it up only if it does involve unacceptable\nmetaphysical and epistemological commitments\u201d (1989:\n23\u201324).\n\nIt may be questioned, however, whether moral realism really does enjoy\nintuitive support, and also questioned whether, if it does, this\nshould burden the anti-realist with extra labor.\n\nOn the first matter, it may be argued that some of the distinctions\ndrawn in distinguishing moral realism from anti-realism are too\nfine-grained or abstruse for \u201cthe folk\u201d to have any\ndeterminate opinion. It is, for example, radically unclear to what\nextent common sense embraces the objectivity of moral facts.\nThere have been some empirical investigations ostensibly examining the\nextent to which ordinary people endorse moral objectivism (e.g.,\nGoodwin & Darley 2008; Uttich et al. 2014), but, upon examination,\nmany of these studies seem in fact to examine the extent to which\nordinary people endorse moral absolutism. (See Hopster 2019.)\nAnd if even professional researchers struggle to grasp the concept of\nmoral objectivity, it is difficult to maintain confidently that\n\u201cthe folk\u201d have a firm and determinate intuition on the\nsubject. Furthermore, even if empirical investigation of collective\nopinion were to locate strong intuitions in favor of a\nmind-independent morality, there may be other equally robust\nintuitions in favor of morality being mind-dependent. (For\nexample, the fact that we seem unwilling to defer to experts when\nforming moral views appears to count against realism; see McGrath\n2011. Similarly, the fact that we do not expect a person necessarily\nto accept others\u2019 reasons for their moral views seems to reveal\nanti-realist tendencies; see Foot 1958 for discussion.) Given the\ndifficulties in deciding and articulating just what kind of\nobjectivity is relevant to the moral realism/anti-realism division,\nand given the range and potential subtlety of options, it might be\nthought rash to claim that common sense has a firm opinion one way or\nthe other on this subject.\n\nOn the second matter: even if we were to identify a widespread\nunivocal intuition in favor of moral realism, it remains unclear to\nwhat extent we should adopt a methodology that rewards moral realism\nwith a dialectical advantage when it comes to metaethics. By\ncomparison, we do not think that physicists should endeavor to come up\nwith intuitive theories. (There is, for example, a widespread\nerroneous intuition that a fast-moving ball exiting a curved tube will\ncontinue to travel on a curving trajectory (McCloskey et al. 1980).\nThe fact that Newtonian physics predicts that the ball will in fact\ncontinue on a straight trajectory is surely in no sense a mark against\nthe theory.) Moreover, it is important to distinguish between any such\npro-realist intuitions ex ante and ex post. Once\nsomeone has accepted considerations and arguments in favor of moral\nanti-realism, then any counter-intuitiveness that this conclusion\nhas\u2014ex ante\u2014may be considered irrelevant. One noteworthy\ntype of strategy here is the \u201cdebunking argument,\u201d which\nseeks to undermine moral intuitions by showing that they are the\nproduct of processes that we have no grounds for thinking are reliable\nindicators of truth. (See Street 2006; O\u2019Neill 2015; Joyce 2013,\n2016.) To the extent that the anti-realist can provide a plausible\nexplanation for why humans would tend to think of morality as\nobjective, even if it is not objective, then any counter-intuitiveness\nin the anti-realist\u2019s failure to accommodate objectivity can no\nlonger be raised as an ongoing consideration against moral\nanti-realism.\n\nA theory\u2019s clashing with common sense is not the only way in\nwhich it can face a burden of proof. Of two theories, A and B, if A\nexplains a range of observable phenomena more readily than B, then\nproponents of B will have to undertake extra labor of squaring their\ntheory with the available evidence\u2014and this may be the case even\nif B strikes people as the more intuitive theory. For example, perhaps\nNewtonian physics is more intuitive than Einsteinian, but there is\nobservable data\u2014e.g., the results of the famous solar eclipse\nexperiments of 1919\u2014that the latter theory is much better\nequipped to explain.\n\nWhat is it, then, that metaethical theories are expected to explain?\nThe range of phenomena is ill-defined and open-ended, but is typically\ntaken to include such things as the manifest features of moral\nlanguage, the importance of morality in our lives, moral practices and\ninstitutions, the way moral considerations engage motivation, the\ncharacter of moral disagreement, and the acquisition of moral\nattitudes.\n\nConsider the first of these explananda: moral language. Here it seems\nreasonable to claim that the noncognitivist shoulders a burden of\nproof. Moral predicates appear to function linguistically like any\nother predicate: Just as the sentence \u201cThe cat is brown\u201d\nmay be used as an antecedent of a conditional, as a premise of an\nargument, as the basis of a question (\u201cIs the cat\nbrown?\u201d), have its predicate nominalized (\u201cBrownness is\nhad by the cat\u201d), be embedded in a propositional attitude claim\n(\u201cMary believes that the cat is brown\u201d), and have the\ntruth predicate applied to it (\u201c\u2018The cat is brown\u2019\nis true\u201d)\u2014so too can all these things be done, without\nobvious incoherence, with a moral sentence like \u201cStealing is\nmorally wrong.\u201d This is entirely as the cognitivist would\npredict. By contrast, for a noncognitivist who maintains (as Ayer did)\nthat this moral judgment amounts to nothing more than\n\u201cStealing!\u201d uttered in a special disapproval-expressing\ntone, all of this linguistic evidence represents a major (and perhaps\ninsurmountable) challenge.\n\nOther explananda, on the other hand, may reveal that it is the moral\nrealist who has the extra explaining to do. If moral properties are\ntaken to have an essential normativity\u2014in terms of, say, placing\npractical demands upon us\u2014then the realist faces the challenge\nof explaining how any such thing could exist objectively. The\nmoral non-objectivist, by contrast, sees moral normativity as\nsomething that we create\u2014that practical demands arise from our\ndesires, emotions, values, judgments, practices, or institutions. Thus\nthe task of providing a moral ontology that accommodates normativity\nseems a much easier one for the non-objectivist than for the moral\nrealist. (The noncognitivist and the error theorist would seem to have\nan even easier time, since for them there is no moral ontology at\nall.)\n\nThere remains a great deal of dispute concerning what the phenomena\nare that a metaethical theory should be expected to explain; and even\nwhen some such phenomenon is roughly agreed upon, there is often\nsignificant disagreement over its exact nature. For example, pretty\nmuch everyone agrees that any decent metaethical theory should be able\nto explain the close connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation\u2014but it is a live question whether that connection\nshould be construed as a necessary one, or whether a reliably\ncontingent connection will suffice. (See Svavard\u00f3ttir 2006;\nRosati 2021.) Even when such disputes can be settled, there remains\nplenty of room for arguing over the importance of the explanandum in\nquestion (relative to other explananda), and for arguing whether a\ngiven theory does indeed adequately explain the phenomenon.\n\nIn short, attempts to establish the burden of proof are as slippery\nand indecisive in the debate between the moral realist and the moral\nanti-realist as they tend to be generally in philosophy. The matter is\ncomplicated by the fact that there are two kinds of burden-of-proof\ncase that can be pressed, and here they tend to pull against each\nother. On the one hand, it is widely assumed that common sense favors\nthe moral realist. On the other hand, moral realists face a cluster of\nexplanatory challenges concerning the nature of moral facts (how they\nrelate to non-moral facts, how we have access to them, why they have\npractical importance)\u2014challenges that seem much more tractable\nfor the moral non-objectivist and often simply don\u2019t arise for\neither the noncognitivist or the error theorist. This tension between\nwhat is considered to be the intuitive position and what is\nconsidered to be the empirically, metaphysically, and\nepistemologically defensible position, motivates and animates\nmuch of the debate between the moral realist and moral\nanti-realist.\n3. Arguing For and Against Moral Anti-realism\n\nGiven that moral anti-realism is a disjunction of three views, then\nany argument for any of those views is an argument for moral\nanti-realism. By the same token, any argument against any of the three\nviews can contribute to an argument for moral realism, and if one is\npersuaded by arguments against all three, then one is committed to\nmoral realism. Here is not the place to present such arguments in\ndetail, but offer a flavor of the kinds of considerations that push\nphilosophers to and fro on these matters.\n3.1 Noncognitivism\n\nOn the face of it, when we make a public moral judgment, like\n\u201cThat act of stealing was morally wrong,\u201d what we are\ndoing is asserting that the act of stealing in question instantiates a\ncertain property: moral wrongness. This raises a number of extremely\nthorny metaethical questions: What kind of property is moral\nwrongness? How does it relate to the natural properties instantiated\nby the action? How do we have epistemic access to the property? How do\nwe confirm whether something does or does not instantiate the\nproperty? (And so on.) The difficulty of answering such questions may\nlead one to reject the presupposition that prompted them: One might\ndeny that in making a moral judgment we are engaging in the assignment\nof properties at all. Such a rejection is, roughly speaking, the\nnoncognitivist proposal. (See entry for\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.)\n\nIt is impossible to characterize noncognitivism in a way that will\nplease everyone. Sometimes it is presented as a view about mental\nstates and sometimes about moral language. This is because it is a\nclaim about \u201cmoral judgments,\u201d and we can consider moral\njudgments either as private mental acts or as public utterances. If we\nare thinking of moral judgments as mental states, then noncognitivism\nis the claim that moral judgments are not beliefs. If we are thinking\nof moral judgments as speech acts, then noncognitivism is the view\nthat moral judgments do not express beliefs\u2014i.e., it is\nthe view that moral judgments are not assertions. Here, for brevity,\nthe latter formulation will be preferred.\n\nIf moral judgments are not assertions, then what are they? Here the\ndifferent kinds of answers give rise to different forms of\nnoncognitivism. Ayer, as was mentioned earlier, maintained that when\nwe make a moral judgment we are expressing certain feelings, such as\napproval or disapproval. Another influential kind of noncognitivism\ncalled \u201cprescriptivism\u201d claims that moral judgments are\nreally veiled commands whose true meaning should be captured using the\nimperative mood: Someone who says \u201cStealing is morally\nwrong\u201d is really saying something like \u201cDon\u2019t\nsteal!\u201d (see Carnap 1935: 24\u201325). R.M. Hare (1952, 1963)\nrestricted this to commands that one is willing to universalize.\n\nIf noncognitivism is defined as the negation of cognitivism\u2014as a\ntheory about what moral judgments are not\u2014then the two theories\nare not just contraries but contradictories. However, a degree of\nbenign relaxation of criteria allows for the possibility of\n\u201cmixed\u201d theories. If we consider noncognitivism not as a\npurely negative thesis, but as a range of positive proposals (such as\nthose just mentioned), then it becomes possible that the nature of\nmoral judgments combines both cognitivist and noncognitivist elements.\nFor example, moral judgments (as speech acts) may be two\nthings: They may be assertions and ways of issuing commands.\n(By analogy: To call someone a \u201ckraut\u201d is both to assert\nthat they are German and to express a derogatory attitude toward\npeople of this nationality.) C.L. Stevenson held such a mixed view\n(1944); for modern versions, see Copp 2001; Schroeder 2009; Svoboda\n2011.\n\nAs mentioned, one of the major attractions of noncognitivism is that\nit is a means of sidestepping a number of thorny puzzles about\nmorality. In addition, there are several features of morality that, it\nhas been argued, the noncognitivist can accommodate more readily than\nthe cognitivist. Here are three.\n\nFirst, it has often been argued that noncognitivism does a good job of\naccounting for the motivational efficacy of moral judgment. If, when I\nsay \u201cStealing is morally wrong,\u201d I am expressing my\ndisapproval of stealing, and if disapproval is a motivation-engaging\nstate, then it seems to follow that when I sincerely judge that\nstealing is morally wrong, I will also be motivated not to steal. By\ncontrast, if a Humean view of psychology is accepted, according to\nwhich beliefs alone can never motivate, then the cognitivist must\nallow that moral judgment alone cannot motivate; it requires\nthe presence of certain desires as well. A number of philosophers have\nargued that the cognitivist view of moral motivation seems inadequate\n(Smith 1994; Toppinen 2004; see also Carbonell 2013). See entry for\n moral motivation.\n\nSecond, it has been argued that moral disagreements have certain\nqualities that are accommodated better by the noncognitivist than the\ncognitivist. The fact that moral disagreements are often both vehement\nand seemingly intractable, for example, might be taken as evidence\nthat what is really going on is a clash of emotional attitudes rather\nthan a clash of beliefs (Stevenson 1948; Gibbard 1992; Blackburn\n1998).\n\nThird, it has often been observed that we are markedly uncomfortable\nwith the idea that anyone should come to hold a moral view on the\nbasis of having deferred to an expert on morality\u2014in contrast to\nthe way that we are perfectly comfortable with the idea that a person\nshould defer to experts when forming beliefs about, say, plate\ntectonics. This reluctance to defer to experts in forming our moral\nviews would make sense if what we are doing when we make a moral\njudgment is expressing our emotional attitudes on the matter. (See\nMcGrath 2009: 322, 2011; Hills 2011.)\n\nStanding against these considerations in favor of noncognitivism are a\nnumber of weighty problems. The most well-known challenge for\nnoncognitivism is the so-called Frege-Geach problem. If\n\u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d is not even the kind of thing\nthat can be true or false, then how can we make sense of it when it is\nembedded in logically complex contexts (such as \u201cIf stealing is\nmorally wrong, then encouraging your brother to steal is morally\nwrong\u201d), and how are we to make sense of it as a premise in a\nvalid argument (since validity is, by definition, a truth-preserving\nrelation)?\n\nThere have been considerable efforts on behalf of noncognitivism to\nanswer this challenge. Simon Blackburn, for example, has pursued what\nhe calls a \u201cquasi-realist\u201d program (Blackburn 1984, 1993,\n1998). The quasi-realist is someone who endorses an anti-realist\nmetaphysical stance but who seeks, through philosophical maneuvering,\nto earn the right for moral discourse to enjoy all the\ntrappings of realist talk. Such a view may hold that although the\nunderlying logical structure of the sentence \u201cStealing is\nmorally wrong\u201d is nothing more than \u201cStealing:\nBoo!\u201d, it is nevertheless legitimate for ordinary speakers to\nsay things like \u201cIf stealing is morally wrong, then encouraging\nyour brother to steal is wrong\u201d or \u201c\u2018Stealing is\nmorally wrong\u2019 is true.\u201d One might, for instance, argue\nthat all that is required to make it acceptable to consider\n\u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d true or false (and thus a\nlegitimate antecedent in a conditional) is that it has the appropriate\nsurface propositional grammar (\u201cx is P\u201d); and one might\nmaintain that choosing to employ such grammar to express one\u2019s\nnoncognitive attitudes brings no ontological commitment to any\ntroublesome property of moral wrongness.\n\nOne of the main challenges for the quasi-realist is to maintain a\ntheoretic distance from the moral realist. If the quasi-realist\nprogram succeeds in vindicating the use of the truth predicate for\nmoral sentences, and if in addition it makes it permissible to say\n\u201cIt is a fact that stealing is wrong,\u201d \u201cIt is a\nmind-independent fact that stealing is wrong,\u201d \u201cStealing\nwould be wrong even if our attitude toward it were different,\u201d\nand so on\u2014mimicking all and any of the moral realist\u2019s\nassertions\u2014then in what sense is quasi-realism\nquasi-realism?\u2014Why has it not simply collapsed into the\nrobust moral realism that it set out to oppose? (See Wright 1988;\nDreier 2018.) [A quick note on terminology: Although I have here\npresented Blackburn\u2019s quasi-realism as a potential avenue for\nthe noncognitivist to pursue, it should be noted that Blackburn\nhimself eschews the label \u201cnoncognitivism\u201d to describe the\nposition he defends (Blackburn 1996); his preferred term is\n\u201cprojectivism.\u201d (For discussion of the relation between\nthe two views\u2014noncognitivism and projectivism\u2014see Joyce\n2009.)]\n3.2 Error Theory\n\nThe error theorist is a cognitivist: maintaining that moral judgment\nconsists of beliefs and assertions. However, the error theorist thinks\nthat these beliefs and assertions are never true. (The error theorist\ncontrasts here with what can be called the \u201csuccess\ntheorist.\u201d) Moral judgments are never true because the\nproperties that would be necessary to render them\ntrue\u2014properties like moral wrongness, moral goodness, virtue,\nevil, etc.\u2014simply don\u2019t exist, or at least are not\ninstantiated. Defenders of moral error theory include Mackie 1977,\nHinckfuss 1987, Joyce 2001, and Olson 2014.\n\nIf I assert that my dog is a reptile, then I\u2019ve asserted\nsomething false\u2014though in this case there are other things that\nare reptiles. If I assert that my dog is a unicorn then again\nI\u2019ve asserted something false\u2014though in this case\nthere\u2019s nothing in the actual world to which I could attach the\npredicate \u201c\u2026 is a unicorn\u201d and end up with a true\nassertion. The error theorist thinks that employing moral discourse is\nrather like talking about unicorns, though in the case of unicorns\nmost people now know that they don\u2019t exist, while in the case of\nmoral properties most people are unaware of the error. To be an error\ntheorist about unicorns doesn\u2019t require that you think unicorns\nare impossible creatures; it\u2019s enough that you think\nthat they simply don\u2019t actually exist. In the same way, to be a\nmoral error theorist doesn\u2019t require that you think that moral\nproperties couldn\u2019t possibly exist; it would be enough to think\nthat they are never actually instantiated. (Note that there may be a\ndifference between saying \u201cProperty P is never actually\ninstantiated\u201d and \u201cProperty P doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d\nbut that\u2019s a problem for metaphysicians to sort out. Holding\neither view with respect to moral properties is enough to make one a\nmoral error theorist.)\n\nTo be an error theorist about unicorns does not mean that every\nassertion involving the word \u201cunicorn\u201d is false. There\nwould be no error, for example, in asserting \u201cUnicorns do not\nexist,\u201d \u201cThe ancient Greeks believed that unicorns lived\nin India,\u201d or \u201cMy dog is not a unicorn.\u201d What is\ndistinctive about these three sentences is that one would not, in\nasserting them, be committing oneself to the existence of unicorns.\n(It would be rather troubling if this were not true of the first, in\nparticular!) Similarly, the moral error theorist may allow that the\nfollowing are true: \u201cMoral wrongness does not exist,\u201d\n\u201cAugustine believed that stealing pears was wrong,\u201d and\n\u201cStealing is not morally wrong.\u201d\n\nThe last example (\u201cStealing is not morally wrong\u201d) calls\nfor an extra comment. In ordinary conversation\u2014where,\npresumably, the possibility of moral error theory is not considered a\nlive option\u2014someone who claims that X is not wrong\nwould be taken to be implying that X is morally good or at\nleast morally permissible. And if \u201cX\u201d denotes\nsomething awful, like torturing innocent people, then this can be used\nto make the error theorist look awful. But when we are doing\nmetaethics, and the possibility of moral error theory is on the table,\nthen this ordinary implication breaks down. The error theorist\ndoesn\u2019t think that torturing innocent people is morally wrong,\nbut doesn\u2019t think that it is morally good or morally permissible\neither. It is important that criticisms of the moral error theorist do\nnot trade on equivocating between the implications that hold in\nordinary contexts and the implications that hold in metaethical\ncontexts.\n\nThe sentence \u201cUnicorns exist\u201d is false, but there are\nnevertheless various contexts where one might have reason to utter the\nsentence: telling a story, joking, acting, speaking metaphorically,\ngiving an example of a two-word sentence, etc. What is distinctive\nabout these contexts is that one would not be asserting the\nsentence, and thus (as before) one would not, in making these\nutterances, be committing oneself to the existence of unicorns.\nSimilarly, the moral error theorist might propose that we carry on\nsaying things like \u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d but in a\nmanner that deprives our utterances of ontological commitment to moral\nproperties and, thus, removes the error from our discourse.\nIf the error theorist proposes to accomplish this by modeling moral\nlanguage on a way that familiar engagement with fictions nullifies\ncommitment, then such a moral error theorist is a\nfictionalist. (See entry for\n fictionalism;\n see also Kalderon 2005; Joyce 2017.) Other moral error theorists may\nthink that we would be better off if we pretty much eliminated moral\ntalk from our thoughts and language. Such moral error theorists are\nknown as \u201cabolitionists\u201d or \u201celiminativists.\u201d\n(I say \u201cpretty much\u201d since presumably even the\nabolitionist allows that we can carry on using moral language in the\ncontext of plays, jokes, etc.) (For debate between fictionalists and\nabolitionists, see Garner & Joyce 2019.)\n\nError theory is commonly defined as the view that moral judgments are\n(i) truth-evaluable but (ii) always false. But there are various\nreasons for preferring to render (i) as a claim about speech\nacts\u2014that moral judgments aim at the truth (i.e., they\nare assertions)\u2014and (ii) as the broader claim that moral\njudgments are \u201cuntrue\u201d rather than \u201cfalse.\u201d\nOne might, for example, be drawn to error theory because one thinks\nthat there is a sufficient amount of indeterminacy, fragmentation, or\nconfusion surrounding moral concepts that the judgments that employ\nthem, while satisfying the conditions for being beliefs and\nassertions, do not satisfy the conditions for having truth value.\nPerhaps, for example, moral concepts are historically derived from a\ntheistic framework within which they made sense, yet removed from\nwhich they are mere remnants that evoke strong intuitions but, upon\nexamination, make no sense. (See Anscombe 1958; MacIntyre 1984.) If\nthis is so, then it may be argued that the concept moral\nwrongness is just so ill-defined that someone who makes the moral\njudgment \u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d fails to put forward\na proposition that could be true; but since the speaker and audience\nare presumably unaware of this fact, the judgment should still count\nas an assertion. (One needs to tread carefully here. The proposal that\nmoral judgments lack truth value is traditionally associated with\nnoncognitivism. But the noncognitivist thinks that moral judgments\nlack truth value because they are not assertions at all. The error\ntheorist, by contrast, thinks that moral judgments are\n(typically) asserted, but that they fail to be true. Failing to have a\ntruth value is one way of failing to be true. Being false is the other\nway.)\n\nMost arguments for moral error theory, however, presuppose that moral\nconcepts do have a reasonably determinate content, but that there is\nsimply nothing in the world to satisfy this content. The traditional\nform of argument for moral error theory, thus, has two steps. First,\nthe error theorist undertakes the conceptual step of\nestablishing that in participating in moral discourse we commit\nourselves to the world being a certain way (that it contains certain\ninstantiated properties, etc.). Then the error theorist undertakes the\nontological step of establishing that the world is not that\nway. The latter may be achieved (in principle, at least) either\nthrough a priori means or through a posteriori\nmethods.\n\nOne example of an argument with this structure is as follows. First it\nis noted that \u201cS morally ought to \u03c6\u201d is true\nonly if S is a moral agent. The further conceptual steps of\nthe argument then seek to establish that in order to be moral agent,\nS must have the capacity to perform actions that are morally\nblameworthy and praiseworthy, and that these capacities presuppose\nthat S has a certain kind of control over their actions. The\nontological step of the argument then seeks to establish that no such\nautonomous control exists in nature; it\u2019s an illusion. (See\nentry for\n skepticism about moral responsibility.)\n A couple of iterations of modus tollens then take us to the\nconclusion that \u201cS morally ought to \u03c6\u201d is\nnever true.\n\nThe argument just sketched would locate the moral error in a mistake\nwe make about the kind of creatures we are. The more widely discussed\narguments, however, locate the moral error in a mistake we make about\nthe kind of world we inhabit. John Mackie (who coined the term\n\u201cerror theory\u201d in 1977) argues that when we participate in\nmoral discourse we commit ourselves to the existence of objective\nvalues and objective prescriptions, but there are no such things.\nEssentially, Mackie argues that the moral realist is correct about\nmorality conceptually speaking\u2014we are moral\nrealists\u2014but the moral realist is incorrect about how the world\nactually is. Moral facts place demands upon us, but (Mackie asks) how\ncould such demands exist objectively? This would\nseem to require rules of conduct somehow written into the fabric of\nthe universe, and nothing in our understanding of the objective\nnaturalistic world (Mackie goes on) suggests that anything of the kind\nexists. Mackie famously calls such properties \u201cqueer\u201d (in\nwhat seems now an increasingly anachronistic use of the term).\n\nMackie occasionally cashes out his \u201cargument from\nqueerness\u201d in terms of practical reasons. He writes that\n\u201cto say that [objective prescriptions] are intrinsically\naction-guiding [which is one way he sometimes describes the\nnormativity whose existence he denies] is to say that the reasons that\nthey give for doing or for not doing something are independent of that\nagent\u2019s desires or purposes\u201d (Mackie 1982: 115). Surely if\nsomeone is morally required to do something (Mackie thinks), then that\nperson must have a reason to do it. (After all, if one were to deny\nthis, then what kind of \u201cnormative teeth\u201d would moral\nproperties have? \u201cYes, I know that X is morally wrong,\nbut I have no reason to avoid moral wrongness, so the wrongness of\nX is nothing to me\u201d would become, in principle, an\nacceptable thing to say.) But since morality often seems to demand\nthat we do things that we don\u2019t want to do, then morality seems\nto imply the existence of reasons to do things that we don\u2019t\nwant to do. One could, at this point, simply throw up one\u2019s\nhands and claim that such reasons would be too weird to countenance.\nBut one could also go beyond the \u201cargument from queerness\u201d\nby instead arguing methodically that a Humean (instrumentalist) theory\nof reasons for action\u2014according to which reasons ultimately\ndepend on our ends\u2014is superior to any form of practical\nnon-instrumentalism. (See entry for\n reason for action: internal and external.)\n According to such a view, the practical non-instrumentalist is\ncorrect about morality conceptually speaking\u2014in\nengaging in moral discourse, we commit ourselves to\nnon-instrumentalist reasons\u2014but the practical\nnon-instrumentalist is incorrect about how the world actually is: a\nHumean theory of reasons for action is more defensible. (It is worth\nnoting that endorsing Humean instrumentalism about reasons for action\ndoes not in any obvious way commit one to the endorsement of\ninstrumentalism about other kinds of reasons, such as epistemic\nreasons. See Joyce 2019; Cowie 2019.)\n\nIf an argument for moral error theory has two steps\u2014the\nconceptual and the ontological\u2014then there are two places to\nobject. If we consider Mackie\u2019s argument, for example, then one\nkind of opponent will agree that objective values and prescriptions\nwould be too weird to countenance, but maintain that it doesn\u2019t\nmatter because moral discourse is not committed to the existence of\nsuch strange creatures. Another kind of opponent will agree with\nMackie that morality is committed to the existence of objective values\nand prescriptions, but maintain that there is nothing particularly\nstrange about them.\n\nError theorists must be prepared to defend themselves on both fronts.\nThis job is made difficult by the fact that it may be hard to\narticulate precisely what it is that is so troubling about morality.\nThis failure need not be due to a lack of clear thinking or\nimagination on the error theorists\u2019 part, for the thing that is\ntroubling them may be that there is something deeply mysterious about\nmorality. The moral error theorist may, for example, perceive that\nmoral imperatives are imbued with a kind of mystical practical\nauthority\u2014a quality that, being mysterious, of course\ncannot be articulated in terms satisfactory to an analytic\nphilosopher. Such an error theorist is forced to fall back on vague\nmetaphors in presenting their case: Moral properties have a\n\u201cto-be-pursuedness\u201d to them (Mackie 1977: 40), moral facts\nwould require that \u201cthe universe takes sides\u201d (Burgess\n[1978] 2007), moral believers are committed to \u201cdemands as real\nas trees and as authoritative as orders from headquarters\u201d\n(Garner 1994: 61), and so on. Indeed, it may be the vague, equivocal,\nquasi-mystical, and/or ineliminably metaphorical imponderabilia of\nmoral discourse that so troubles the error theorist. (See Hussain\n2004.)\n\nEven if the error theorist can articulate a clear and determinate\nproblematic feature of morality, the dispute over whether this quality\nshould count as a \u201cnon-negotiable component\u201d of morality\nhas a tendency to lead quickly to impasse, for there is no accepted\nmethodology for deciding when a discourse is \u201ccentrally\ncommitted\u201d to a given thesis. What is evidently needed is a\nworkable model of the identity criteria for concepts (allowing us\nconfidently to either affirm or deny such claims as \u201cThe concept\nof moral obligation is the concept of an objective\nrequirement\u201d)\u2014but we have no such model, and there is no\nconsensus even on what approximate shape such a model would take.\n\nIt is also possible that the most reasonable account of conceptual\ncontent will leave many concepts with significantly indistinct\nborders. There may simply be no fact of the matter about whether moral\ndiscourse is committed to the existence of non-instrumental reasons\n(for example). Thinking along these lines, David Lewis makes use of\nthe distinction between speaking strictly and speaking loosely:\n\u201cStrictly speaking, Mackie is right: genuine values would have\nto meet an impossible condition, so it is an error to think there are\nany. Loosely speaking, the name may go to a claimant that deserves it\nimperfectly \u2026 What to make of the situation is mainly a matter\nof temperament\u201d (Lewis [1989] 2000: 93). Lewis\u2019s own\ntemperament leads him to seek to vindicate value discourse, and he\nthinks that this can be done by supporting a dispositional theory of\nvalue (of a kind to be discussed in the next section). But since there\nis no logical or methodological requirement that we should prefer\nspeaking loosely over speaking strictly, or vice versa, then this\nwould leave the dispute between moral error theorists and success\ntheorists a fundamentally undecidable matter\u2014there may simply be\nno fact of the matter about who is correct. (See Joyce 2012.)\n3.3 Non-objectivism\n\nTo deny both noncognitivism and the moral error theory suffices to\nmake one a minimal moral realist. Traditionally, however, moral\nrealism has required the acceptance of a further thesis: the\nobjectivity of morality. \u201cMoral non-objectivism\u201d denotes\nthe view that moral facts exist and are mind-dependent (in the\nrelevant sense), while \u201cmoral objectivism\u201d holds that they\nexist and are mind-independent. (Note that this taxonomy makes the two\ncontraries rather than contradictories; the error theorist and the\nnoncognitivist count as neither objectivists nor non-objectivists. The\nerror theorist may, however, be an objectivist in a different sense:\nin holding that objectivity is a feature of morality\nconceptually speaking.) Let us say that if one is a moral\ncognitivist and a moral success theorist and a moral\nobjectivist, then one is a robust\nmoral realist.\n\nYet this third condition, even more than the first two, introduces a\ngreat deal of messiness into the dialectic, and the line between the\nrealist and the anti-realist becomes obscure (and, one might think,\nless interesting). The basic problem is that there are many\nnon-equivalent ways of understanding the relation of\nmind-(in)dependence, and thus one philosopher\u2019s realism\nbecomes another philosopher\u2019s anti-realism. At least one\nphilosopher, Gideon Rosen, has expressed pessimism that the relevant\nnotion of objectivity can be sharpened to a useful philosophical\npoint:\n\nTo be sure, we do have \u201cintuitions\u201d of a sort about when\nthe rhetoric of objectivity is appropriate and when it isn\u2019t.\nBut these intuitions are fragile, and every effort I know to find the\nprinciple that underlies them collapses. We sense that there\nis a heady metaphysical thesis at stake in these debates over realism\n\u2026 [b]ut after a point, when every attempt to say just what the\nissue is has come up empty, we have no real choice but to conclude\nthat despite all the wonderful, suggestive imagery, there is\nultimately nothing in the neighborhood to discuss. (1994: 279. See\nalso Dworkin 1996.)\n\n\nAs Rosen says, metaphors to mark non-objectivism from objectivism are\neasy to come by and easy to motivate in the uninitiated. The\nobjectivist about X likens our X-oriented activity\nto astronomy, geography, or exploration; the non-objectivist likens it\nto sculpture or imaginative writing. (These are Michael\nDummett\u2019s metaphors (1978: xxv).) The objectivist sees the goal\nof our inquiries as being to \u201ccarve the beast of reality at the\njoints\u201d (as the popular paraphrase of Plato\u2019s\nPhaedrus puts it); the non-objectivist sees our inquiries as\nthe application of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d: imposing a\nnoncompulsory conceptual framework onto an undifferentiated reality\n(to use Hilary Putnam\u2019s equally memorable image (1987: 19)). The\nobjectivist sees inquiry as a process of detection, our\njudgments aiming to reflect the extension of the truth\npredicate with respect to a certain subject; the non-objectivist sees\ninquiry as a process of projection, our judgments\ndetermining the extension of the truth predicate regarding\nthat subject.\n\nThe claim \u201cX is mind-(in)dependent\u201d is certainly\ntoo coarse-grained to do serious work in capturing these powerful\nmetaphors; it is, perhaps, better thought of as a slogan or as a piece\nof shorthand. There are two conspicuous points at which the phrase\nrequires precisification. First, we need to decide what exactly the\nword \u201cmind\u201d stands for. It can be construed strictly and\nliterally, to mean mental activity, or it can be understood\nin a more liberal manner, to include such things as conceptual\nschemes, theories, methods of proof, linguistic practices,\nconventions, sentences, institutions, culture, means of epistemic\naccess, etc. Were the moral facts to depend on any of these\nanthropocentric things, the anti-realist imagery of humans as\ninventors of morality may seem more apt than that of humans as\ndiscoverers. Second, we need to decide what kind of relation is\ndenoted by \u201c(in)dependent.\u201d Consider the following\npossibilities, any of which might form the basis of the claim that\ngoodness depends on mental activity (in this case, for\nsimplicity, Mary\u2019s attitude of approval):\n\n\nx is good iff Mary approves of x.\n\nx is good iff Mary would approve of x (in\nsuch-and-such circumstances).\n\nx is good iff x merits Mary\u2019s approval.\n\n\nThe catalog can be made longer, depending on whether the\n\u201ciff\u201d is construed as necessary or contingent, conceptual,\na priori, or a posteriori. To illustrate further the\nubiquity of and variation among mind-dependence relations on the menu\nof moral theories, consider the following:\n\nAccording to classic utilitarianism, one is obligated to act so as\nto maximize moral goodness, and moral goodness is identical to\nhappiness. Happiness is a mental phenomenon.\nAccording to Kant, one\u2019s moral obligations are determined by\nwhich maxims can be consistently willed as universal laws; moreover,\nthe only thing that is good in itself is a good will. Willing is a\nmental activity, and the will is a mental faculty.\nAccording to John Rawls (1971), fairness is determined by the\nresults of an imaginary collective decision, wherein self-interested\nagents negotiate principles of distribution behind a veil of\nignorance. Decision-making, negotiation, and agency all require mental\nactivity.\nAccording to Michael Smith (1994), the morally right action for a\nperson to perform depends in part on what advice would be given to\nthat person by her epistemically and rationally idealized counterpart.\n(See also Railton 1986.) Epistemic improvement and rational\nimprovement are mental phenomena.\nAccording to Richard Boyd (1988), moral goodness is identical to a\ncluster of properties conducive to the satisfaction of human needs,\nwhich tend to occur together and promote each other. Human needs may\nnot all be mental, but the needs that depend in no way on the\nexistence of mental activity are surely few.\nAccording to Frank Jackson (1998), ethical terms pick out\nproperties that play a certain role in the conceptual network\ndetermined by mature folk morality. \u201cThe folk\u201d necessarily\nhave minds, and the relevant process of \u201cmaturing\u201d is\npresumably one that implicates a variety of psychological events.\n\n\nIndeed, it is difficult to think of any serious version of moral\nsuccess theory for which the moral facts depend in no way on\nmental activity. Yet to conclude that the distinction between minimal\nand robust realism cannot be upheld would be premature. Many\nmetaethicists who reject noncognitivism and the error theory, and thus\ncount as minimal realists, continue to define their position (often\nunder the label \u201cconstructivism\u201d) in contrast to a realist\nview. (See Bagnoli 2002; Ronzoni 2010; Street 2010, 2012. See also the\nentry on\n constructivism in metaethics.)\n The challenge is to pick among the various mind-(in)dependence\nrelations in the hope of drawing a distinction that is philosophically\ninteresting and meshes satisfactorily with our preexisting\nphilosophical taxonomy, such that some success theorists count as\nrealists and some do not.\n\nElizabeth Tropman (2018) argues that the best way of understanding\nmoral objectivity is as follows: The fact that x is\nM (where \u201c\u2026 is M\u201d is some moral\npredicate) is objective if and only if this fact doesn\u2019t depend\nonly on any actual or hypothetical agent\u2019s (i) belief or\nnoncognitive attitude about x\u2019s being M, or\n(ii) noncognitive attitude about x. According to this view,\nmany of the aforementioned examples of moral theories, although making\nmoral facts dependent in various ways on various kinds of mental\nphenomena, will not count as non-objective. Consider, for example, the\nutilitarian view that what makes a particular action, \u03c6, morally\nobligatory is that it produces maximal happiness. According to this\nview, although some agent\u2019s (or agents\u2019) mental\nstates\u2014in this case, their happiness\u2014may contribute to\n\u03c6\u2019s moral status, they do not exclusively determine it.\nOther factors also contribute to \u03c6\u2019s moral status, such as\nhow \u03c6 compares with other potential actions in terms of happiness\nproduction,. Therefore, on Tropman\u2019s view, this form of\nutilitarianism would satisfy the requirements for morality to count as\nobjective.\n\nThe attractions of moral non-objectivism are that it ticks a lot of\nboxes that its competitors fail to tick. Unlike noncognitivism or\nerror theory, moral non-objectivism is a form of moral anti-realism\nthat allows for the existence of moral beliefs, moral facts, and moral\ntruth, and thus also potentially makes conceptual space for such\nthings as moral progress and moral knowledge. Unlike moral realism, by\nmaking the moral facts depend on us, moral non-objectivism seems to\nhave an easier time accounting for a moral ontology that is both\nnaturalistic and normative.\n\nGiven the wide variety of versions of moral non-objectivity,\nidentifying generic problems is not a straightforward task. One way of\nbringing out some potential worries is to see the non-objectivist as\nfacing a dilemma. Moral non-objectivism comes in both relativistic and\nabsolutist flavors, and either way one goes poses challenges.\n\nConsider first an absolutist version on non-objectivism. Here we would\nhave to identify some agent or group of agents whose beliefs or\nnoncognitive attitudes determine the moral facts. Reasonable\ncontenders for this role are not going to be actual particular people.\nIt would not, for example, be a reasonable theory that maintained that\nthe moral facts for everyone throughout all time are determined by\nwhat Richard Joyce thinks on the matter. (The only plausible contender\nfor this role might be God, but such a theory faces its own\narray of problems.) Rather, absolutist non-objectivists are likely to\nplump for idealized hypothetical agents. Roderick Firth (1952), for\nexample, identifies moral properties with dispositions to prompt\nresponsive attitudes in an \u201cideal observer\u201d\u2014where\nthe ideal observer is defined in terms such as omniscience,\ndisinterestedness, and dispassionateness. (Slightly confusingly for\nour purposes, Firth explicitly characterizes this theory as an\nobjectivist one, but this is because he has in mind a kind of\nexistential mind-dependence relation. The moral status of an\naction, on this view, doesn\u2019t depend on the existence of an\nideal observer\u2019s mental activity; rather, it depends on how such\nan agent counterfactually would respond. We can consider this as\nfurther evidence of the difficulties in nailing down a fixed notion of\nmoral objectivity.) A structurally similar version of\nabsolutist non-objectivism is Ronald Milo\u2019s contractarian\nconstructivism (1995), according to which the moral facts are\ndetermined by the choices that would be made by a hypothetical\nidealized group of rational contractors. (See also Scanlon 1998.)\n\nThe challenge for such theories is to explain why one should\ncare about the moral status of actions. Since the person or\ngroup that determines the moral status of my actions is not\nme, and is not even someone I\u2019ve ever met or\nnecessarily care about, then why should their hypothetical responses\nmatter to me? Any particular proposed action of mine will have an\ninfinity of dispositional properties. My proposed action of, say,\nstealing a newspaper may have the dispositional property that a\nFirthian ideal observer would disapprove of it, while simultaneously\nhaving the dispositional property that a Miloesque idealized group of\nrational contractors would choose to refrain from it. But it also has\na myriad of other dispositions to prompt responses in hypothetical\nagents: it may also be such that drunken Vikings would heartily cheer\nit, be such that zealous medieval samurai would think it dishonorable,\nbe such that Soviet communists seeking to promote the Workers\u2019\nRevolution would regard it as obligatory, and so on. The question is\nwhy I, in trying to decide how to act, should care about any of these\ndispositional properties\u2014or (perhaps more pointedly) why I\nshould care about one of them very much indeed while ignoring all the\nothers. Simply labeling one of these dispositional properties\n\u201cmoral wrongness\u201d doesn\u2019t make that property\nmatter.\n\nOne response to this challenge is to make the idealized judges, whose\nbeliefs or noncognitive states determine the moral status of\nagents\u2019 actions, versions of the agents themselves (see Carson\n1984). Perhaps I have reason to care about what I would think\nif I were, say, fully informed and had fully reflected on the matter.\nThis brings us back to the other horn of the dilemma: the relativistic\nversion on non-objectivism. The problem is that securing the practical\nsignificance of moral facts in this manner (something that the\nabsolutist version struggles to secure) comes at a price. If you and I\nare quite different people\u2014with different desires, interests,\nand goals\u2014then the idealized version of me may have a different\nresponse to a situation than the idealized version of you would have\n(see Sobel 1999). In this case, the very same action may be morally\nright relative to me and morally wrong relative to you, and\nthat\u2019s all there is to it: there would be no way for you and me\nto settle our moral disagreement. Indeed, there may not even\nbe a disagreement, since if when I say \u201cX is\nmorally right\u201d I mean \u2026 relative to idealized\nme, and when you say \u201cNo, X is not morally\nright\u201d you mean \u2026 relative to idealized you,\nthen we are not really contradicting each other. (See entry for\n moral relativism.)\n If relativistic non-objectivism makes moral disagreement disappear,\nthen it very probably also makes the notion of moral progress\ndisappear. If the moral views I held in the past were true\nrelative to me then (though false relative to me now), and my\ncurrent very different moral views are true relative to me now (but\nfalse relative to past me), then the best one could say on behalf of\nmoral progress is that there has been progress from my current\npoint of view (something that will be seen as moral deterioration\nfrom my past point of view). To the extent, then, that we do wish to\naccommodate the existence of moral disagreement and moral progress,\nrelativistic non-objectivism has some explaining to do. (Note that the\nversion of relativistic non-objectivism just discussed is\nindividual-relative, but the same problems concerning disagreement and\nmoral progress would arise if a culture-oriented version of relativism\nwere examined instead.)\n\nThe proposal that moral facts are non-objective\u2014that morality is\nsomething created, not discovered\u2014is often rejected in popular\ndiscussion because people have only crude versions of non-objectivism\nin mind, such as views that would make the moral facts for a person be\njust whatever whimsically suits them (e.g., \u201cX is\nmorally wrong\u201d = \u201cI disapprove of X\u201d). But\nno professional philosopher endorses such a view; nobody thinks that\nthe non-objectivity of morality would be like the non-objectivity of\nchoosing your favorite ice cream flavor. Serious forms of moral\nnon-objectivism are sophisticated and subtle. Still, there is a real\nworry that if the non-objectivism is too\nsophisticated\u2014especially if it looks to the responses of highly\nidealized hypothetical agents as being determinative of the moral\nfacts\u2014then the question of why, on this account, morality would\nmatter to non-idealized non-hypothetical agents comes to the\nfore.\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has not attempted to adjudicate the rich and noisy debate\nbetween the moral realist and moral anti-realist, but rather has\nattempted to clarify just what their debate is about. But even this\nmuch more modest task is doomed to lead to unsatisfactory results, for\nthere is much confusion\u2014perhaps a hopeless\nconfusion\u2014about how the terms of the debate should be drawn up.\nIt is entirely possible that when subjected to acute critical\nexamination, the traditional dialectic between the moral realist and\nthe moral anti-realist will crumble into a bunch of evocative\nmetaphors from which well-formed philosophical theses cannot be\nextracted. If this is true, it would not follow that metaethics is\nbankrupt; far from it\u2014it may be more accurate to think that\nmodern metaethics has prospered to such an extent that the old terms\nno longer fit its complex landscape.\n\nBut for present, at least, the terms \u201cmoral realist\u201d and\n\u201cmoral anti-realist\u201d seem firmly entrenched. With so much\nill-defined, however, it would seem close to pointless to conduct\nmetaethical debate under these terms. This latitude means\nthat the terms \u201cmoral realist\u201d and \u201cmoral\nanti-realist\u201d are free to be bandied with rhetorical\nforce\u2014more as badges of honor or terms of abuse (as the case may\nbe) than as useful descriptive labels. Rather like arguments over\nwhether some avant-garde gallery installation does or does not count\nas \u201cart,\u201d taxonomic bickering over whether a given\nphilosopher is or is not a \u201cmoral realist\u201d is an activity\nas tiresome as it is fruitless.\n\nJust as important as gaining a clear and distinct understanding of\nthese labels is gaining an appreciation of what of real consequence\nturns on the debate. This seems particularly pressing here because a\nnatural suspicion is that much of the opposition to moral anti-realism\ndevelops from a nebulous but nagging practical concern about what\nmight happen\u2014to individuals, to the community, to\nsocial order\u2014if moral anti-realism, in one guise or another,\nwere widely adopted. The embrace of moral anti-realism, it is assumed,\nwill have an insidious influence. This concern presupposes that most\nof the folk are already pretheoretically inclined toward\nmoral realism\u2014an assumption that was queried earlier. But even\nif it is true that most people are naive moral realists, the question\nof what would happen if they ceased to be so is an empirical matter,\nconcerning which neither optimism nor pessimism seems prima facie more\nwarranted than the other. As with the opposition to moral\nnon-objectivism, the more general opposition to moral anti-realism is\nfrequently based on an under-estimation of the resources available to\nthe anti-realist\u2014on an unexamined assumption that the silliest,\ncrudest, or most pernicious version will stand as a good\nrepresentative of a whole range of extremely varied and often\nsophisticated theories.\n",
