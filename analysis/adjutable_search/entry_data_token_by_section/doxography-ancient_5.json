    "main_text": "Doxography broad and narrow\n6. Doxography broad and narrow\n\nConsequently, doxography in the narrower sense (derived from the\nnature of the majority of the sources discussed and edited by Diels in\nthe Doxographi Graeci), can be defined as: the normally very\nbrief presentation according to theme, or subject, of contrasting (or\neven bizarre, or compromise) tenets in natural philosophy (or science,\nif you wish), which in itself does not provide a decisive answer to\nthe issue involved although it may assist you to find a solution. The\napplication of the term \u2018doxography\u2019 to what one finds in\nAristotle (or, on a much more limited scale, in Plato, who\noccasionally quotes the views of others to further a discussion) can\ntherefore be misleading (see Mansfeld 2000).\n\nTurning now to doxography in the broad sense, we observe that\nCicero\u2019s leisured and extensive presentations, e.g., in his\nOn the Nature of the Gods of the Epicurean and Stoic\ndoctrines in the field of theology-cum-physics\u2014presentations\nfollowed by Academic-Skeptical refutations\u2014may be, and have\nbeen, called by the name of doxography. But there are obvious\ndifferences from doxographies of the A\u00ebtian type. To be sure, one\nmight perhaps, with some hesitation, maintain that what we have here\nis a sort of blow-up of the dialectical scheme one also finds in the\nPlacita literature, with the skeptical component made\nexplicit: contrasting doctrines which turn out to be improvable.\nSuch\u00a0 a move however\u00a0 is less valid for Diogenes\nLa\u00ebrtius, in spite of the fact that this author several times\nmakes a distinction between the life (bios) of a person\n(Plato; the Stoic Zeno of Citium) and the areskonta or\ndogmata of this person, or of his school. It is therefore\nperhaps better to classify these overviews in Cicero and Diogenes\nLa\u00ebrtius as belonging with an ancient genre which we may view as\na sub-species of doxography, namely the (largely lost) literature\nPeri Hairese\u00f4n (\u2018On Schools\u2019), which deals\nwith philosophical, or medical, schools and eventually may include\narguments against the position of a particular hairesis\n(\u2018school\u2019). Philodemus, and Arius Didymus (on ethics),\nbelong here as well.\n\nScholars, as we have noticed, also speak of ethical doxographies. One\ncould justify this usage by submitting that this is going beyond\nDiels, and back to Aristotle. We have seen that Aristotle advised his\npupils (and himself) also to construct lists of ethical propositions\nand problems. In his ethical treatises we actually find dialectical\noverviews concerning problems in ethics, though on a much more modest\nscale than in the physical treatises. But a doxographical literature\nin the field of ethics, which as to scale and taxonomy would be even\nremotely comparable to physical doxography, never existed. Yet one\noccasionally encounters short lists and overviews of ethical tenets in\nsome later authors. It is therefore possible that modest doxographical\ncollections of ethical views did circulate, and we may have some\nevidence concerned with the circulation (and adaptation) of a\ndiaeretical overview of tenets about the End, or Highest Good (Algra\n1997).\n",
