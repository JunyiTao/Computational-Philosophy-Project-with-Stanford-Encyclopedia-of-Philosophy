Further Contemporary Design Discussions\n4.1 Cosmological: Fine-tuning\n\nIntuitively, if the laws of physics were different, the evolution of\nlife would not have taken the same path. If gravity were stronger, for\nexample, then flying insects and giraffes would most likely not exist.\nContemporary physics provides significantly more drama to the story.\nEven an extraordinarily small change in one of many key parameters in\nthe laws of physics would have made life impossible anywhere in the\nuniverse. Consider two examples:\n\nThe expansion rate of the universe is represented by the\ncosmological constant \u039b. If \u039b were slighter greater,\nthere would be no energy sources, such as stars. If it were slightly\nless, the Big Bang would have quickly led to a Big Crunch in which the\nuniverse collapsed back onto itself. For life to be possible, \u039b\ncannot vary more than one part in 1053 (Collins 2003)\n\nLife depends on, among other things, a balance of carbon and\noxygen in the universe. If the strong nuclear force were different by\n0.4%, there would not be enough of one or the other for life to exist\n(Oberhummer, Cs\u00f3t\u00f3, and Schlattl 2000). Varying this\nconstant either way \u201cwould destroy almost all carbon or almost\nall oxygen in every star\u201d (Barrow 2002, 155). \n\n\nMany examples of fine-tuning have to do with star formation. Stars are\nimportant since life requires a variety of elements: oxygen, carbon,\nhydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Stars contain the only\nknown mechanism for producing large quantities of these elements and\nare therefore necessary for life. Lee Smolin estimates that when all\nof the fine-tuning examples are considered, the chance of stars\nexisting in the universe is 1 in 10229. \u201cIn my\nopinion, a probability this tiny is not something we can let go\nunexplained. Luck will certainly not do here; we need some rational\nexplanation of how something this unlikely turned out to be the\ncase\u201d (Smolin 1999, 45). Smolin is not merely claiming that all\nimprobable events require an explanation, but some improbable events\nare special. (In poker, every set of five cards dealt to the dealer\nhas the same probability, assuming that the cards are shuffled\nsufficiently. If the dealer is dealt a pair on three successive hands,\nno special explanation is required. If the dealer is dealt a royal\nflush on three successive hands, an explanation would rightly be\ndemanded, and the improbability of this case isn\u2019t even close to\nthe magnitude of the improbability that Smolin mentioned.) Physicists\nwho have written on fine-tuning agree with Smolin that it cries out\nfor an explanation. (What physicists in general think is, of course,\nharder to determine.) One explanation is that the universe appears to\nbe fine-tuned for the existence of life because it literally has been\nconstructed for life by an intelligent agent.\n\nThere are two other types of responses to fine-tuning: (i) it does\nnot, in fact, require a special explanation, and (ii) there are\nalternative explanations to theistic design. Let\u2019s briefly\nconsider these (also see the entry on\n fine-tuning).\n4.1.1 No explanation needed\n\nThree approaches have been taken to undermine the demand for\nexplanation presented by fine-tuning.\n4.1.1.1 Weak anthropic principle\n\nIn a sense, it is necessary for the fine-tuned constants to have\nvalues in the life-permitting range: If those values were not within\nthat range, people would not exist. The fine-tuned constants\nmust take on the values that they have in order for\nscientists to be surprised by their discovery in the first place. They\ncould not have discovered anything else. According to the weak\nanthropic principle, we ought not to be surprised by having made such\na discovery, since no other observation was possible. But if we should\nnot have been surprised to have made such a discovery, then there is\nnothing unusual here that requires a special explanation. The demand\nfor explanation is simply misplaced.\n4.1.1.2 Observational selection effect\n\nSober gives a related but stronger argument based on observational\nselection effects (Sober 2009, 77\u201380). Say that Jones nets a\nlarge number of fish from a local lake, all of which are over 10\ninches long. Let \\(h_{\\textrm{all}}\\) = \u2018all of the fish in the lake\nare over 10 inches long\u2019 and \\(h_{1/2}\\) = \u2018Half of the\nfish in the lake are over 10 inches long\u2019. The evidence \\(e\\) is\nsuch that \\(P(e|h_{\\textrm{all}}) >\nP(e | h_{1/2})\\). Now say that Jones discovers\nthat his net is covered with 10 inch holes, preventing him from\ncapturing any smaller fish. In that case, \\(e\\) does not favor one\nhypothesis over the other. The evidence \\(e\\) is an artifact of the net\nitself, not a random sample of the fish in the lake.\n\nWhen it comes to fine-tuning, Sober considers\n\\(h_{\\textrm{design}}\\) = \u2018the constants have been set in place by an\nintelligence, specifically God\u2019, and\n\\(h_{\\textrm{chance}}\\) = \u2018the constants are what they are as a matter\nof mindless random chance\u2019. While intuitively\n\n\\(P(\\textrm{constants are just right for life} | h_{\\textrm{design}}) >\\) \n  \\(\\;\\; P(\\textrm{constants are just right for life} | h_{\\textrm{chance}}) \\)\n\n\none has to consider the role of the observer, who is analogous to the\nnet in the fishing example. Since human observers could only detect\nconstants in the life-permitting range, Sober argues, the correct\nprobabilities are\n\n\\( P(\\textrm{you observe that the constants are right} |\nh_{\\textrm{design}} \\amp \\textrm{you exist}) =\\) \n\\(\\;\\; P(\\textrm{you\nobserve that the constants are right} | h_{\\textrm{chance}} \\amp\n\\textrm{you exist}) \\)\n\n\nGiven this equality, fine-tuning does not favor \\(h_{\\textrm{design}}\\)\nover \\(h_{\\textrm{chance}}\\). The selection effect prevents any\nconfirmation of design.\n\nSober\u2019s analysis is critiqued in Monton 2006 and Kotzen\n2012. Also see Jantzen 2014a (sec. 18.4). We should note that if\nSober is correct, then the naturalistic explanations for fine-tuning\nconsidered below (4.1.2) are likewise misguided.\n4.1.1.3 Probabilities do not apply\n\nLet C stand for a fine-tuned parameter with physically\npossible values in the range [0, \u221e). If we assume that nature is\nnot biased toward one value of C rather than another, then\neach unit subinterval in this range should be assigned equal\nprobability. Fine-tuning is surprising insofar as the life-permitting\nrange of C is tiny compared to the full interval, which\ncorresponds to a very small probability.\n\nAs McGrew, McGrew & Vestrup argue (2001), there is a problem here\nin that, strictly speaking, mathematical probabilities do not apply in\nthese circumstances. When a probability distribution is defined over a\nspace of possible outcomes, it must add up to exactly 1. But for any\nuniform distribution over an infinitely large space, the sum of the\nprobabilities will grow arbitrarily large as each unit interval is\nadded up. Since the range of C is infinite, McGrew et\nal.  conclude that there is no sense in which life-friendly\nuniverses are improbable; the probabilities are mathematically\nundefined.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to truncate the interval of possible\nvalues. Instead of allowing C to range from [0, \u221e), one\ncould form a finite interval [0, N], where N is very\nlarge relative to the life-permitting range of C. A\nprobability distribution could then be defined over the truncated\nrange.\n\nA more rigorous account employs measure theory. Measure is sometimes\nused in physics as a surrogate for probability. For example, there are\nmany more irrational numbers than rational ones. In measure theoretic\nterms, almost all real numbers are irrational, where\n\u201calmost all\u201d means all but a set of zero measure. In\nphysics, a property found for almost all of the solutions to an\nequation requires no explanation; it\u2019s what one should expect.\nIt\u2019s not unusual, for instance, for a pin balancing on its tip\nto fall over. Falling over is to be expected. In contrast, if a\nproperty that has zero measure in the relevant space were actually\nobserved to be the case, like the pin continuing to balance on its\ntip, that would demand a special explanation (Earman 1987, 315).\nAssuming one\u2019s model for the system is correct, nature appears\nto be strongly biased against such behavior (Gibbons, Hawking &\nStewart 1987, 736). The argument for fine-tuning can thus be recast\nsuch that almost all values of C are outside of the\nlife-permitting range. The fact that our universe is life-permitting\nis therefore in need of explanation.\n\nThe question of whether probabilities either do not apply or have been\nimproperly applied to cosmological fine-tuning continues to draw\ninterest. For more, see Davies 1992, Callender 2004, Holder\n2004, Koperski 2005, Manson 2009, Jantzen 2014a (sec. 18.3), and\nSober 2019 (sec. 5.1). Manson (2018) argues that neither theism nor\nnaturalism provides a better explanation for fine-tuning.\n4.1.2 Rival explanations\n\nAssuming that fine-tuning does require an explanation, there are\nseveral approaches one might take (Koperski 2015, section 2.4).\n4.1.2.1 Scientific progress\n\nThat the universe is fine-tuned for life is based on current science.\nJust as current science explained or explained away many past\nanomalies, future science may explain or explain away fine-tuning.\nScience may one day find a naturalistic answer, eliminating the need\nfor design. For suggestions along these lines, see Harnik, Kribs &\nPerez 2006, and Loeb 2014.\n\nWhile this is a popular stance, it is a promissory note rather than an\nexplanation. The appeal to what might yet be discovered is not itself\na rival hypothesis.\n4.1.2.2 Exotic life\n\nIt\u2019s conceivable that life could exist in a universe with\nparameter values that we do not typically believe are life-permitting.\nIn other words, there may be exotic forms of life that could survive\nin a very different sort of universe. If so, then perhaps the\nparameter intervals that are in fact life-permitting are not\nfine-tuned after all.\n\nThe main difficulty with this suggestion is that all life requires a\nmeans for overcoming the second law of thermodynamics. Life requires\nthe extraction of energy from the environment. Any life-form\nimaginable must therefore have systems that allow for something like\nmetabolism and respiration, which in turn require a minimal amount of\ncomplexity (e.g., there can be no single-molecule life forms). Many\nexamples of fine-tuning do not allow for such complexity, however. If\nthere were no stars, for example, then there would be no stable\nsources of energy and no mechanism for producing the heavier elements\nin the periodic table. Such a universe would lack the chemical\nbuilding blocks needed for a living entity to extract energy from the\nenvironment and thereby resist the pull of entropy.\n4.1.2.3 Multiverse\n\nWhile the odds of winning a national lottery are low, your odds would\nobviously increase if you were to buy several million tickets. The\nsame idea applies to the most popular explanation for fine-tuning: a\nmultiverse. Perhaps physical reality consists of a massive array of\nuniverses each with a different set of values for the relevant\nconstants. If there are many\u2014perhaps infinitely\nmany\u2014universes, then the odds of a life-permitting universe\nbeing produced would seem to be much greater. While most of the\nuniverses in the multiverse would be unfit for life, so the argument\ngoes, ours is one of the few where all of the constants have the\nrequired values.\n\nWhile the philosophical literature on the multiverse continues to grow\n(see Collins 2009, 2012, and Kraay 2014), many of the arguments\nagainst it share a common premise: a multiverse would not, by itself,\nbe a sufficient explanation of fine-tuning. More would have to be\nknown about the way in which universes are produced. By analogy, just\nbecause a roulette wheel has 38 spaces does not guarantee that the\nprobability of Red 25 is 1/38. If the wheel is rigged in some\nway\u2014by using magnets for example\u2014to prevent that outcome,\nthen the probability might be extremely small. If the table were\nrigged and yet Red 25 was the actual winner, that would\nrequire a special explanation. Likewise, one would have to know\nwhether universe production within the multiverse is biased for,\nagainst, or is indifferent to the life-permitting values of the\nrelevant constants. Depending on the outcome, the existence of a\nmultiverse might or might not explain fine-tuning.\n\nA more pressing problem would be the proliferation of \u201cBoltzmann\nbrains\u201d (BB) in a multiverse (Carroll 2020). BBs are intelligent\nbeings produced by quantum fluctuations. The beliefs of such\nnonstandard observers are formed by random processes and therefore\nlack rational support. Since there would be many orders of magnitude\nmore BBs than standard observers in a multiverse, it is statistically\nlikely that you are not, in fact, a standard observer after all. This\nfact serves as a defeater for most of your beliefs, including your\nbelief in a multiverse. Belief in a multiverse is therefore\nself-defeating.\n4.2 Biological: Intelligent Design\n\nA high-profile development in design arguments over the past 20 years\nor so involves what has come to be known as Intelligent Design (ID).\nAlthough there are variants, it generally involves efforts to\nconstruct design arguments taking cognizance of various contemporary\nscientific developments (primarily in biology, biochemistry, and\ncosmology)\u2014developments which, as most ID advocates see it, both\nreveal the inadequacy of mainstream explanatory accounts (condition\n(a)) and offer compelling evidence for design in nature at some level\n(condition (e) again).\n\nID advocates propose two specialized Rs\u2014irreducible\ncomplexity (Behe 1996) and specified complex information\n(Dembski 1998,\n 2002).[11]\n Although distinctions are sometimes blurred and while ID arguments\ninvolving each of those Rs tend to be gap arguments,\nan additional focus on mind-reflective aspects of nature is typically\nmore visible in ID arguments citing specified complexity than in\narguments citing irreducible complexity.\n\nThe movement has elicited vociferous criticism and opposition (Pennock\n2000). Opponents have pressed a number of objections against ID\nincluding, inter alia contentions that ID advocates have\nsimply gotten the relevant science wrong, that even where the science\nis right the empirical evidences cited by design advocates do not\nconstitute substantive grounds for design conclusions, that the\nexistence of demonstrably superior alternative explanations for the\nphenomena cited undercuts the cogency of ID cases, and that design\ntheories are not legitimate science, but are just disguised\ncreationism, God-of-the-gaps arguments, religiously motivated,\netc.\n\nWe will not pursue that dispute here except to note that even if the\ncase is made that ID could not count as proper science, which is\n controversial,[12]\n that would not in itself demonstrate a defect in design arguments as\nsuch. Science need not be seen as exhausting the space of legitimate\nconclusions from empirical data. In any case, the floods of vitriol\nflowing from both\n\nsides in the current ID discussion suggest that much more than the\npropriety of selected inferences from particular empirical evidences\nis at issue.\n5. The Persistence of Design Thinking\n\nThat question is: why do design arguments remain so durable if\nempirical evidence is inferentially ambiguous, the arguments logically\ncontroversial, and the conclusions vociferously disputed? One\npossibility is that they really are better arguments than most\nphilosophical critics concede. Another possibility is that design\nintuitions do not rest upon inferences at all. The situation\nmay parallel that of the existence of an external world, the existence\nof other minds, and a number of other familiar matters. The 18th\ncentury Scottish Common Sense philosopher Thomas Reid (and his\ncontemporary followers) argued that we are simply so constructed that\nin certain normally-realized experiential circumstances we simply\nfind that we in fact have involuntary convictions about such\na world, about other minds, and so forth. That would explain why\nhistorical philosophical attempts to reconstruct the\narguments by which such beliefs either arose or were justified were\nsuch notorious failures\u2014failures in the face of which ordinary\nbelief nonetheless proceeded happily and helplessly onward. If a\nsimilar involuntary belief-producing mechanism operated with respect\nto intuitions of design, that would similarly explain why\nargumentative attempts have been less than universally compelling but\nyet why design ideas fail to disappear despite the purported failure\nof such arguments.\n\nA number of prominent figures historically in fact held that we could\ndetermine more or less perceptually that various things in nature were\ncandidates for design attributions\u2014that they were in the\nrequisite respects design-like. Some, like William Whewell,\nheld that we could perceptually identify some things as more than mere\ncandidates for design (1834, 344). Thomas Reid also held a view in\nthis\n region,[13]\n as did Hume\u2019s Cleanthes, and, more recently, Alvin Plantinga\n(2011, 263\u2013264).\n\nIf something like that were the operative process, then ID, in trying\nto forge a scientific link to design in the sense of\ninferences from empirically determined evidences would be\nmisconstructing the actual basis for design belief, as would be design\narguments more generally. It is perhaps telling, in this regard, that\nscientific theorizing typically involves substantial creativity and\nthat the resultant theories are typically novel and unexpected. Design\nintuitions, however, do not seem to emerge as novel construals from\ncreative grappling with data, but are embedded in our thinking nearly\nnaturally\u2014so much so that, again, Crick thinks that biologists\nhave to be immunized against it.\n6. Conclusion\n\nPerception and appreciation of the incredible intricacy and the beauty\nof things in nature\u2014whether biological or cosmic\u2014has\ncertainly inclined many toward thoughts of purpose and design in\nnature, and has constituted important moments of affirmation for those\nwho already accept design positions. Regardless of what one thinks of\nthe arguments at this point, so long as nature has the power to move\nus (as even Kant admitted that the \u2018starry heavens above\u2019\ndid), design convictions and arguments are unlikely to disappear\nquietly.",
