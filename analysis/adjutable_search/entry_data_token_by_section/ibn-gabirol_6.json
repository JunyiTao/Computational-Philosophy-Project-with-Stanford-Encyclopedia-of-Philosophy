    "main_text": "The Divine Creative Act\n4. The Divine Creative Act\n\n\nIbn Gabirol describes God's creative act in many ways across\nhis philosophical and poetic writings. While it is certainly possible\nto find a single overall theological picture emerging from across Ibn\nGabirol's work, it is at least worth noting a degree of tension\nbetween a range of different and sometimes seemingly conflicting ideas.\nIn what follows, we will look at the complex play of creation,\nemanation, Will, Wisdom, Word, and desire in Ibn Gabirol's\ncosmo-ontology.\n",
