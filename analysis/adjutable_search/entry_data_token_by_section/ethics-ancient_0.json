    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn their moral theories, the ancient philosophers depended on several\nimportant notions. These include virtue and the virtues, happiness\n(eudaimonia), and the soul. We can begin with virtue.\n\nVirtue is a general term that translates the Greek word\naret\u00ea. Sometimes aret\u00ea is also\ntranslated as excellence. Many objects, natural or artificial, have\ntheir particular aret\u00ea or kind of excellence. There is\nthe excellence of a horse and the excellence of a knife. Then, of\ncourse, there is human excellence. Conceptions of human excellence\ninclude such disparate figures as the Homeric warrior chieftain and\nthe Athenian statesman of the period of its imperial expansion.\nPlato\u2019s character Meno sums up one important strain of thought\nwhen he says that excellence for a man is managing the business of the\ncity so that he benefits his friends, harms his enemies, and comes to\nno harm himself (Meno 71e). From this description we can see\nthat some versions of human excellence have a problematic relation to\nthe moral virtues.\n\nIn the ancient world, courage, moderation, justice and piety were\nleading instances of moral virtue. A virtue is a settled disposition\nto act in a certain way; justice, for instance, is the settled\ndisposition to act, let\u2019s say, so that each one receives their\ndue. This settled disposition consists in a practical knowledge about\nhow to bring it about, in each situation, that each receives their\ndue. It also includes a strong positive attitude toward bringing it\nabout that each receives their due. Just people, then, are not ones\nwho occasionally act justly, or even who regularly act justly but do\nso out of some other motive; rather they are people who reliably act\nthat way because they place a positive, high intrinsic value on\nrendering to each their due and they are good at it. Courage is a\nsettled disposition that allows one to act reliably to pursue right\nends in fearful situations, because one values so acting\nintrinsically. Moderation is the virtue that deals similarly with\none\u2019s appetites and emotions.\n\nHuman excellence can be conceived in ways that do not include the\nmoral virtues. For instance, someone thought of as excellent for\nbenefiting friends and harming enemies can be cruel, arbitrary,\nrapacious, and ravenous of appetite. Most ancient philosophers,\nhowever, argue that human excellence must include the moral virtues\nand that the excellent human will be, above all, courageous, moderate,\nand just. This argument depends on making a link between the moral\nvirtues and happiness. While most ancient philosophers hold that\nhappiness is the proper goal or end of human life, the notion is both\nsimple and complicated, as Aristotle points out. It seems simple to\nsay everyone wants to be happy; it is complicated to say what\nhappiness is. We can approach the problem by discussing, first, the\nrelation of happiness to human excellence and, then, the relation of\nhuman excellence to the moral virtues.\n\nIt is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living\nwell and doing well. These phrases imply certain activities associated\nwith human living. Ancient philosophers argued that whatever\nactivities constitute human living \u2013 e.g., those associated with\npleasure \u2013 one can engage in those activities in a mediocre or\neven a poor way. One can feel and react to pleasures sometimes\nappropriately and sometimes inappropriately; or one might always act\nshamefully and dishonorably. However, to carry out the activities that\nconstitute human living well over a whole lifetime, or long stretches\nof it, is living well or doing well. At this point the relation of\nhappiness to human excellence should be clear. Human excellence is the\npsychological basis for carrying out the activities of a human life\nwell; to that extent human excellence is also happiness.\n\nSo described, human excellence is general and covers many activities\nof a human life. However, one can see how human excellence might at\nleast include the moral virtues. The moral virtue relevant to fear,\nfor instance, is courage. Courage is a reliable disposition to react\nto fear in an appropriate way. What counts as appropriate entails\nharnessing fear for good or honorable ends. Such ends are not confined\nto one\u2019s own welfare but include, e.g., the welfare of\none\u2019s city. In this way, moral virtues become the kind of human\nexcellence that is other-regarding. The moral virtues, then, are\nexcellent qualities of character \u2013 intrinsically valuable for\nthe one who has them; but they are also valuable for others. In rough\noutline, we can see one important way ancient moral theory tries to\nlink happiness to moral virtue by way of human excellence. Happiness\nderives from human excellence; human excellence includes the moral\nvirtues, which are implicitly or explicitly other-regarding.\n\nSince happiness plays such a vital role in ancient moral theory, we\nshould note the difference between the Greek word eudaimonia\nand its usual translation as \u2018happiness\u2019. Although its\nusage varies, most often the English word \u2018happiness\u2019\nrefers to a feeling. For example, we say, \u201cYou can tell he feels\nhappy right now, from the way he looks and how he is behaving.\u201d\nThe feeling is described as one of contentment or satisfaction,\nperhaps with the way one\u2019s life as a whole is going. While some\nthink there is a distinction between feeling happy and feeling\ncontent, still happiness is a good and pleasant feeling. However,\n\u2018happiness\u2019 has a secondary sense that does not focus on\nfeelings but rather on activities. For instance, one might say,\n\u201cIt was a happy time in my life; my work was going well.\u201d\nThe speaker need not be referring to the feelings he or she was\nexperiencing but just to the fact that some important activity was\ngoing well. Of course, if their work is going well, they might feel\ncontentment. But in speaking of their happiness, they might just as\nwell be referring to their absorption in some successful activity. For\nancient philosophers eudaimonia is closer to the secondary\nsense of our own term. Happiness means not so much feeling a certain\nway, or feeling a certain way about how one\u2019s life as a whole is\ngoing, but rather carrying out certain activities or functioning in a\ncertain way. This sort of happiness is an admirable and praiseworthy\naccomplishment, whereas achieving satisfaction or contentment may not\nbe.\n\nIn this way, then, ancient philosophers typically justify moral\nvirtue. Being courageous, just, and moderate is valuable for the\nvirtuous person because these virtues are inextricably linked with\nhappiness. Everyone wants to be happy, so anyone who realizes the link\nbetween virtue and happiness will also want to be virtuous. This\nargument depends on two central ideas. First, human excellence is a\ngood of the soul \u2013 not a material or bodily good such as wealth\nor political power. Another way to put this idea is to say happiness\nis not something external, like wealth or political power, but an\ninternal, psychological good. The second central idea is that the most\nimportant good of the soul is moral virtue. By being virtuous one\nenjoys a psychological state whose value outweighs whatever other\nkinds of goods one might have by being vicious.\n\nFinally, a few words about the soul are in order since, typically,\nphilosophers argue that virtue is a good of the soul. In some ways,\nthis claim is found in many traditions. Many thinkers argue that being\nmoral does not necessarily provide physical beauty, health, or\nprosperity. Rather, as something good, virtue must be understood as\nbelonging to the soul; it is a psychological good. However, in order\nto explain virtue as a good of the soul, one does not have to hold\nthat the soul is immortal. While Plato, for example, holds that the\nsoul is immortal and that its virtue is a good that transcends death,\nhis argument for virtue as a psychological good does not depend on the\nimmortality of the soul. He argues that virtue is a psychological good\nin this life. To live a mortal human life with this good is in itself\nhappiness.\n\nThis position that links happiness and virtue is called eudaimonism\n\u2013 a word based on the principal Greek word for happiness,\neudaimonia. By eudaimonism, we will mean one of several\ntheses: (a) virtue, together with its active exercise, is identical\nwith happiness; (b) virtue, together with its activities, is the most\nimportant and dominant constituent of happiness; (c) virtue is the\nonly means to happiness. However, one must be cautious not to conclude\nthat ancient theories in general attempt to construe the value of\nvirtue simply as a means to achieving happiness. Each theory, as we\nshall see, has its own approach to the nature of the link between\nvirtue and happiness. It would not be advisable to see ancient\ntheories as concerned with such contemporary issues as whether moral\ndiscourse \u2013 i.e., discourse about what one ought to do \u2013\ncan or should be reduced to non-moral discourse \u2013 i.e., to\ndiscourse about what is good for one.\n\nThese reflections on virtue can provide an occasion for contrasting\nancient moral theory and modern. One way to put the contrast is to say\nthat ancient moral theory is agent-centered while modern\nmoral theory is action-centered. To say that it is\naction-centered means that, as a theory of morality, it explains\nmorality, to begin with, in terms of actions and their circumstances,\nand the ways in which actions are moral or immoral. We can roughly\ndivide modern thinkers into two groups. Those who judge the morality\nof an action on the basis of its known or expected consequences are\nconsequentialist; those who judge the morality of an action on the\nbasis of its conformity to certain kinds of laws, prohibitions, or\npositive commandments are deontologists. The former include, e.g.,\nthose utilitarians who say an action is moral if it provides the\ngreatest good for the greatest number. Deontologists say an action is\nmoral if it conforms to a moral principle, e.g., the obligation to\ntell the truth. While these thinkers are not uninterested in the moral\ndisposition to produce such actions, or in what disposition is\nrequired if they are to show any moral worth in the persons who do\nthem, their focus is on actions, their consequences, and the rules or\nother principles to which they conform. The result of these ways of\napproaching morality is that moral assessment falls on actions. This\nfocus explains, for instance, contemporary fascination with such\nquestions of casuistry as, e.g., the conditions under which an action\nlike abortion is morally permitted or immoral.\n\nBy contrast, ancient moral theory explains morality in terms that\nfocus on the moral agent. These thinkers are interested in what\nconstitutes, e.g., a just person. They are concerned about the state\nof mind and character, the set of values, the attitudes to oneself and\nto others, and the conception of one\u2019s own place in the common\nlife of a community that belong to just persons simply insofar as they\nare just. A modern might object that this way of proceeding is\nbackwards. Just actions are logically prior to just persons and must\nbe specifiable in advance of any account of what it is to be a just\nperson. Of course, the ancients had a rough idea of what just actions\nwere; and this rough idea certainly contributed to the notion of a\njust person, and his motivation and system of values. Still, the\nnotion of a just person is not exhausted by an account of the\nconsequences of just actions, or any principle for determining which\nactions are and which are not just. For the ancients, the just person\nis compared to a craftsman, e.g., a physician. Acting as a physician\nis not simply a collection of medically effective actions. It is\nknowing when such actions are appropriate, among other things; and\nthis kind of knowledge is not always definable. To understand what\nbeing a physician means one must turn to the physician\u2019s\njudgment and even motivation. These are manifested in particular\nactions but are not reducible to those actions. In the same way, what\nconstitutes a just person is not exhausted by the actions he or she\ndoes nor, for that matter, by any catalogue of possible just actions.\nRather, being a just person entails qualities of character proper to\nthe just person, in the light of which they decide what actions\njustice requires of them and are inclined or disposed to act\naccordingly.\n",
