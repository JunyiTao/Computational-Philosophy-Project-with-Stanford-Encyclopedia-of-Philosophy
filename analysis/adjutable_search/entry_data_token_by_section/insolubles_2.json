    "main_text": "Origins of the Medieval Discussion || St. Paul\u2019s Reference to Epimenides\n1.2 St. Paul\u2019s Reference to Epimenides\n\nOne initially plausible stimulus for the medieval discussions would\nappear to be the Epistle to Titus 1:12: \u201cOne of themselves, even\na prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [= Cretans] are always\nliars, evil beasts, slow bellies\u201d. The Cretan in question is\ntraditionally said to have been the sixth-century BCE thinker\nEpimenides. For this reason, the Liar Paradox is nowadays sometimes\nreferred to as the \u201cEpimenides\u201d. Yet, blatant as the\nparadox is here, and authoritative as the Epistle was taken to be, not\na single medieval author is known to have discussed or even\nacknowledged the logical and semantic problems this text poses. When\nmedieval authors discuss the passage at all, for instance in\nScriptural commentaries, they seem to be concerned only with why St.\nPaul should be quoting pagan\n sources.[5]\n It is not known who was the first to link this text with the Liar\nParadox.\n",
