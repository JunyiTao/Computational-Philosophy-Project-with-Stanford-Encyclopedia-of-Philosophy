    "main_text": "Analyzing social convention\n3. Analyzing social convention\n\n\nAlthough philosophers have always been interested in social\nconventions, Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature\noffered the first systematic analysis of what they are. The\ntopic then lay dormant until Lewis revived it in Convention,\nproviding an analysis heavily influenced by Hume\u2019s but far more\ndetailed and rigorous. Lewis\u2019s analysis continues to shape the\ncontemporary discussion. In this section, we briefly discuss Hume and\nthen discuss Lewis in detail. Henceforth, \u201cconvention\u201d\nmeans \u201csocial convention.\u201d\n",
