    "main_text": "Mereology and metaphysics || Persistence\n5. Concluding remarks\n\nMedieval philosophers study a variety of wholes and parts, and they\noften do so with a remarkable degree of sophistication. To be sure,\nsome aspects of medieval mereology are idiosyncratic, but many of the\npuzzles that medieval philosophers wrestle with are analogous to ones\nthat interest contemporary students of logic and metaphysics. Medieval\nphilosophers are particularly attuned to the relationship between\nmereology and various problems in metaphysics, and many of their\nsolutions to puzzles of identity and survival are embraced by\nphilosophers in other periods. Even the idiosyncratic aspects of\nmedieval mereology reveal a sophisticated appreciation of three\nfundamental questions in mereology, namely, what items are wholes,\nwhat items are parts, and under what conditions is one item a part of\nanother item. This survey can only hint at the richness of medieval\nmereology. In part, this is due to the overwhelming number of medieval\nauthors who say something or other, somewhere or other, about parts\nand wholes. But it is also due to the fact that there are still more\ntexts to be unearthed, properly edited, and studied with care. Based\non what we have already discovered, we should be confident that we\nwill find many more interesting reflections on parts and wholes and\nthat we will uncover further connections between medieval mereology\nand more recent theories of parts and wholes.\n",
