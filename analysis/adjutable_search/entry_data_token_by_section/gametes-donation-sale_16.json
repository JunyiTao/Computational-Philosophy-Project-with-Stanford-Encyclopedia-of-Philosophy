    "main_text": "Donor Matching and Selection || Parental Virtues, Expectations, and Openness to the Unbidden\n3.4 Parental Virtues, Expectations, and Openness to the Unbidden\n\nGamete donor selection may also be motivated by a desire to parent a\n\u2018particular kind of child\u2019 such as where a music lover\nseeks out a concert pianist in order to increase the likelihood that\nthe future child will possess such talents, or where a couple seek out\ngamete donors with genius level IQ in order to increase the likelihood\nof rearing an academically gifted child (as with the couples who\npurchased sperm in the 1990s from the \u2018repository of germinal\nchoice\u2019) (Plotz 2006) .\n\nSuch cases raise a different kind of concern about whether selection,\nwhen performed in order to satisfy these kinds of preferences,\nencourages and facilitates the development of ethically troubling\nattitudes on the part of prospective parents.\n\nThis concern has been expressed in various different ways. Some, for\nexample, suggest that selection motivated by such desires is\nincompatible with parental virtues such as \u2018acceptingness\u2019\n(McDougall 2007), \u2018openness to the unbidden\u2019 (Sandel\n2007), and \u2018unconditional love\u2019 (Herrisone-Kelly 2007).\nThose who take this view hold onto the traditional notion of the child\nas a gift and correspondingly suggest that parents ought to care, not\nabout the traits that their children possess, but about developing a\nloving relationship with and raising whatever child they receive.\nOthers take a more Kantian line, suggesting that such parents\nare wrongfully instrumentalising their children: treating them as a\nmeans of fulfilling parental hopes and dreams rather than as entities\nwho, once born, exist for their own sake (Davis 1997).\n\nYet the suggestion that a selective mentality is incompatible with\nimportant parental virtues or problematically instrumentalises\none\u2019s future children has been the subject of some debate.\nAuthors such as Ruddick (2000) and Green (2008), challenge the\n\u2018maternalist assumption\u2019 that parents\n\n\nwho want a child should accept and welcome any child they happen to\nreceive, prepared to appreciate the child\u2019s developing\nindividuality, however different from their own. (Ruddick 2000:\n102)\n\n\nThey hold instead that other conceptions of parenthood can, provided\nthey are not taken to extremes, be perfectly adaptive, and crucially,\ndo not require parents to refrain from all attempts to shape the\ncharacteristics of their prospective children. They suggest that\nparents should rightly be viewed as both guardians of the\nchildren\u2019s future interests, and \u2018gardeners\u2019 who may\nshape and raise children in line with their own preferences and\npriorities.\n\nOthers question whether the virtues of the prospective parent are the\nsame as those of an existing parent. For, although some hold that a\ndesire to have a hand in the characteristics of one\u2019s future\nchildren is part of a broader desire to parent and thus requires\n\u201ccommitting oneself to acting and evaluating one\u2019s actions\nand decisions in light of the project of parenthood\u201d (Vehmas\n2001: 439), others argue that a desire to select is not incompatible\nwith such a commitment. Kamm argues, for example, that a distinction\ncan be made between \u2018caring to have\u2019 a particular child\nand \u2018caring about\u2019 one\u2019s future children once born\nand suggests that there is little reason to assume that the desire to\nseek out certain attributes in one\u2019s children is incompatible\nwith parental virtues or common conceptions of the good parent. She\nnotes\n\n\none can know that one will care about someone just as much whether or\nnot she has certain traits and yet care to have someone that has,\nrather than lacks such traits. (Kamm 2009: 113)\n\n\nThis is echoed by Wilkinson who, discussing a hypothetical example of\ntwo prospective parents who seek to ensure the birth of a blue eyed\nchild and agree that they will put it up for adoption after birth\nshould it not possess such characteristics, notes\n\n\nit is not the desire to select that violates the principle of\nunconditional love [or other parental virtues], but rather the plan to\nreject the child if it does not live up to expectations \u2026 it is\nentirely possible to want to select characteristics while not having\nthis problematic attitude of rejection. (Wilkinson 2010: 29)\n\n\nSome suggest, however, that although selection is not necessarily\nmorally problematic, we should still be concerned that a selective\nmentality may be a precursor of conditional, as opposed to\nunconditional, love once the child is born, or to unrealistic\nexpectations and feelings of entitlement. Thus, the suggestion here is\nthat people who go to great lengths and incur great expense in\nprocuring what are, for them, the \u2018perfect\u2019 gametes, may\nbe more likely to reject or otherwise mistreat their children should\nthey fail to develop the \u2018right\u2019 capacities and interests\n(see, for example: Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). Again, however, it is not\nat all clear that the link between a selective mentality in\nreproduction and overzealous and unforgiving parenting styles is a\nnecessary one, as the majority of parents are not liable to be so\nna\u00efve as to \u201cpresume to know what they are getting simply\nbecause they had a hand in selecting some of their child\u2019s\ngenetic features\u201d (Fahmy 2011: 7), or indeed that gamete donor\nselection is as likely as other more expensive and\neffective forms of selective reproduction (such as genetic\nengineering) to produce such problematic expectations and\nattitudes.\n",
