    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough Gilbert Ryle published on a wide range of topics in\nphilosophy (notably in the history of philosophy and in philosophy of\nlanguage), including a series of lectures centred on philosophical\ndilemmas, a series of articles on the concept of thinking, and a book\non Plato, The Concept of Mind remains his best known and most\nimportant work. Through this work, Ryle is thought to have\naccomplished two major tasks. First, he was seen to have put the final\nnail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism. Second, he is thought to have\nargued on behalf of, and suggested as dualism\u2019s replacement, the\ndoctrine known as philosophical (and sometimes\nanalytical) behaviourism. Sometimes known as an\n\u201cordinary language\u201d, sometimes as an\n\u201canalytic\u201d philosopher, Ryle\u2014even when mentioned in\nthe same breath as Wittgenstein and his followers\u2014is considered\nto be on a different, somewhat idiosyncratic (and difficult to\ncharacterise), philosophical track.\n\nPhilosophical behaviourism has long been rejected; what was worth\nkeeping has been appropriated by the philosophical doctrine of\nfunctionalism, which is the most widely accepted view in philosophy of\nmind today. It is a view that is thought to have saved the\n\u201creality\u201d of the mental from the\n\u201celiminativist\u201d or \u201cfictionalist\u201d tendencies\nof behaviourism while acknowledging the insight (often attributed to\nRyle) that the mental is importantly related to behavioural output or\nresponse (as well as to stimulus or input). According to a reasonably\ncharitable assessment, the best of Ryle\u2019s lessons has long been\nassimilated while the problematic has been discarded. If there are\nconsiderations still brewing from the 1930s and 40s that would\nthreaten the orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of mind, these lie\nsomewhere in work of Wittgenstein and his followers\u2014not in\nRyle.\n\nBut the view just outlined, though widespread, represents a\nfundamental misapprehension of Ryle\u2019s work. First, Cartesianism\nis dead in only one of its ontological aspects: substance dualism may\nwell have been repudiated but property dualism still claims a number\nof contemporary defenders. The problem of finding a place for the\nmental in the physical world, of accommodating the causal power of the\nmental, and of accounting for the phenomenal aspects of consciousness\nare all live problems in the philosophy of mind today because they\nshare some of the doctrine\u2019s ontological, epistemological, and\nsemantic assumptions.\n\nSecond, and importantly, Ryle is not a philosophical\nbehaviourist\u2014at least he does not subscribe to any of the main\ntenets associated with that doctrine as it is known today. One may be\nconfused by this if one is also confused about Ryle\u2019s conception\nof philosophy. Although there is some truth in identifying him as an\nanalytic philosopher\u2014he announces (1932, 61) that \u201cthe\nsole and whole function of philosophy\u201d is philosophical\nanalysis\u2014this is likely to be misunderstood today if one thinks\nthat the proper goal of philosophy (attainable if not in practice at\nleast in ideals) is definitional analysis. It is this that encourages\nthe association with behaviourism (in at least one of its many senses)\nBut Ryle was not an analytical philosopher in this sense. True, Ryle\nacknowledges the influence of Moore\u2019s emphasis on common sense\n(and thus on ordinary language); true, he takes himself to be pursuing\nthe type of philosophical investigation (exemplified by\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions) that involves uncovering the\nlogical form of grammatically misleading expressions. But it is\nimportant to take account of the differences that separate Ryle from\nthe early Moore and Russell for it is their conception of philosophy\nthat has been inherited by many of us working within the\n\u201canalytic\u201d tradition in philosophy today. That is the\nthird point. For Ryle does not believe in meanings (concepts\nor propositions) as these have been traditionally construed (as stable\nobjects or rules, the grasp of which is logically prior to, and thus\nmay be used to explain, the use of expressions). Indeed, Ryle\u2019s\nconception of philosophy was not fundamentally different from that of\nWittgenstein. Ryle sets out in print as early as 1932 a philosophical\nagenda that prefigures the published work of the later Wittgenstein;\nthe \u201celasticity of significance\u201d and \u201cinflections of\nmeaning\u201d Ryle finds in most expressions appear to be the family\nof structures, more or less related, noticed by Wittgenstein; and\nRyle\u2019s attack on the \u201cintellectualist legend\u201d shares\nWittgenstein\u2019s concern to understand a\nproper\u2014non-exalted\u2014place for rules in an explanation of\nvarious philosophically interesting achievements. In spite of the fact\nthat some of Wittgenstein\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were\ndismissive of Ryle\u2019s\n work,[1]\n the best way to understand Ryle is to see him, if not as following in\nWittgenstein\u2019s footsteps, then as walking some stretches of\nphilosophical terrain down a parallel path.\n",
