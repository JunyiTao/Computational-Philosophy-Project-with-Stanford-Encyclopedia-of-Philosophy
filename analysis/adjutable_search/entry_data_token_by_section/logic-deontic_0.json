    "main_text": "Informal Preliminaries and Background\n1. Informal Preliminaries and Background\n\nDeontic logic has been regularly influenced by reflection on the logic\nof modal notions, such as necessity (in varying senses of the\nterm). In particular, analogies between alethic (truth-implicating)\nmodal notions and deontic notions were noticed before the fourteenth\ncentury in Europe, where we might say that the rudiments of formal\n(though not symbolic) deontic logic experienced its initial European\nstirrings. In Islamic thought, such analogies go back at least as far\nas the tenth century.\n\nAlthough interest in what can be arguably called formal aspects of\ndeontic logic continued off and on, the trend toward studying logic\nusing the symbolic and exact techniques of mathematics began\nprimarily in the nineteenth century, and became dominant in the\ntwentieth century. Work in twentieth century symbolic modal logic\nprovided the explicit impetus for von Wright (1951a, 1951b), the\ncentral early figure in the emergence of deontic logic as a\nfull-fledged branch of symbolic logic in the twentieth\ncentury. However, we note that prior to von Wright 1951a, there was\none significant earlier episode in symbolic deontic logic, namely\nMally 1926. See supplement A:\n Mally and Symbolic Deontic Logic.[6]\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we first spell out a few\nfolk-logical features of alethic modal notions, and then give an\nimpressionistic sense of how natural it was for early developments of\ndeontic logic to explore deontic analogs to those features.\n",
