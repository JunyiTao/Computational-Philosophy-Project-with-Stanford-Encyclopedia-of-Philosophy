    "main_text": "Visual thinking and discovery || Discovering a proof strategy\n4.2 Discovering a proof strategy\nIn some cases visual thinking inclines one to believe something on\nthe basis of assumptions suggested by the visual representation that\nremain to be justified given the subject\u2019s current knowledge. In\nsuch cases there is always the danger that the subject takes the\nvisual representation to show the correctness of the assumptions and\nends up with an unwarranted belief. In such a case, even if the belief\nis true, the subject has not made a discovery, as the means of\nbelief-acquisition is unreliable. Here is an example using Figure 7\n(Montuchi and Page 1988).\n\n\nFigure 7\n\nUsing this diagram one can come to think the following about the\nreal numbers. When for a constant \\(k\\) the positive values of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are constrained to satisfy the equation \\(x \\cdot y = k\\),\nthe positive values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for which \\(x + y\\) is minimal\nare \\(x = \\sqrt{k} = y\\). (Let \u201c#\u201d denote this claim.)\nSuppose that one knows the conventions for representing functions\nby graphs in a Cartesian co-ordinate system, knows also that the\ndiagonal represents the function \\(y = x\\), and that a line segment\nwith gradient \u20131 from \\((0, b)\\) to \\((b, 0)\\) represents the\nfunction \\(x + y = b\\). Then looking at the diagram may incline one to\nthink that for no positive value of \\(x\\) does the value of \\(y\\) in\nthe function \\(x\\cdot y = k\\) fall below the value of \\(y\\) in \\(x + y\n= 2\\sqrt{k}\\), and that these functions coincide just at the\ndiagonal. From these beliefs the subject may (correctly) infer the\nconclusion #. But mere attention to the diagram cannot warrant\nbelieving that, for a given positive \\(x\\)-value, the \\(y\\)-value of\n\\(x\\cdot y = k\\) never falls below the \\(y\\)-value of \\(x + y =\n2\\sqrt{k}\\) and that the functions coincide just at the diagonal; for\nthe conventions of representation do not rule out that the curve of\n\\(x\\cdot y = k\\) meets the curve of \\(x + y = 2\\sqrt{k}\\) at two\npoints extremely close to the diagonal, and that the former curve\nfalls under the latter in between those two points. So the visual\nthinking is not in this case a means of discovering proposition #.\nBut it is useful because it provides the idea for a proof of the\nconclusion\u2014one of the major benefits of visual thinking in\nmathematics. In brief: for each equation \\((x\\cdot y = k\\); \\(x + y =\n2\\sqrt{k})\\) if \\(x = y\\), their common value is \\(\\sqrt{k}\\). So the\nfunctions expressed by those equations meet at the diagonal. To show\nthat, for a fixed positive \\(x\\)-value, the \\(y\\)-values of \\(x\\cdot y\n= k\\) never fall below the \\(y\\)-values of \\(x + y = 2\\sqrt{k}\\), it\nsuffices to show that \\(2\\sqrt{k} - x \\le k/x\\). As a geometric mean\nis less than or equal to the corresponding arithmetic mean, \\(\\sqrt{[x\n\\cdot (k/x)]} \\le [x + (k/x)]/2\\).  So \\(2\\sqrt{k} \\le x + (k/x)\\).\nSo \\(2\\sqrt{k} - x \\le k/x\\).\nIn this example, visual attention to, and reasoning about, the\ndiagram is not part of a way of discovering the conclusion. But if it\ngave one the idea for the argument just given, it would be part of\nwhat led to a way of discovering the conclusion, and that is\nimportant.\nCan visual thinking lead to discovery of an idea for a proof in\nmore advanced contexts? Yes. Carter (2010) gives an example from free\nprobability theory. The case is about certain permutations (those\ndenoted by \u201c\\(p\\)\u201d with a circumflex in Carter 2010) on a\nfinite set of natural numbers. Using specific kinds of diagram, easily\nseen properties of the diagrams lead one naturally to certain\nproperties of the permutations (crossing and non-crossing, having\nneighbouring pairs), and to a certain operation (cancellation of\nneighbouring pairs). All of these have algebraic definitions, but the\nideas defined were noticed by thinking in terms of the diagrams. For\nthe relevant permutations \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\sigma(\\sigma(n)) = n\\); so a\npermutation can be represented by a set of lines joining dots. The\npermutations represented on the left and right in Figure 8 are\nnon-crossing and crossing respectively, the former with neighbouring\npairs \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) and \\(\\{6, 7\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (a)\n (b)\n\n\nFigure 8\n\nA permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2p\\}\\) is defined to\nhave a crossing just when there are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\) in\n\\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2p\\}\\) such that \\(a < b < c < d\\) and\n\\(\\sigma(a) = c\\) and \\(\\sigma(b) = d\\). The focus is on the proof of\na theorem which employs this notion. (The theorem is that when a\npermutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2p\\}\\) of the relevant kind is\nnon-crossing, there will be exactly \\(p+1\\) R-equivalence classes,\nwhere \\(R\\) is a certain equivalence relation on \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots,\n2p\\}\\) defined in terms of the permutation.) Carter says that the\nproofs of some lemmas \u201crely on a visualization of the\nsetup\u201d, in that to grasp the correctness of one or more of the\nsteps one needs to visualize the situation. There is also a nice\nexample of some reasoning in terms of a diagram which gives the idea\nfor a proof (\u201csuggests a proof strategy\u201d) for the lemma\nthat every non-crossing permutation has a neighbouring\npair. Reflection on a diagram such as Figure 9 does the work.\n\n\nFigure 9\n\nThe reasoning is this. Suppose that \\(\\pi\\) has no neighbouring\npair.  Choose \\(j\\) such that \\(\\pi(j) - j = a\\) is minimal, that is,\nfor all \\(k, \\pi(j) - j \\le \\pi(k) - k\\). As \\(\\pi\\) has no\nneighbouring pair, \\(\\pi(j+1) \\ne j\\). So either \\(\\pi(j+1)\\) is less\nthan \\(j\\) and we have a crossing, or by minimality of \\(\\pi(j) - j\\),\n\\(\\pi(j+1)\\) is greater than \\(j+a\\) and again we have a\ncrossing. Carter reports that this disjunction was initially believed\nby thinking in term of the diagram, and the proof of the lemma given\nin the published paper is a non-diagrammatic \u201cversion\u201d of\nthat reasoning. In this case study, visual thinking is shown to\ncontribute to discovery in several ways; in particular, by leading the\nmathematicians to notice crucial properties\u2014the\n\u201cdefinitions are based on the diagrams\u201d\u2014and in\ngiving them the ideas for parts of the overall proof.\n",
