    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics || The Philosophy of Space and Time (1928)\n4.4 The Philosophy of Space and Time (1928)\n\nPublished only 4 years after the Axiomatization, The\nPhilosophy of Space and Time (1928h) is an engaging unification\nof a multitude of ideas Reichenbach had previously published,\nincluding the distinction between descriptive and inductive\nsimplicity, the synonymy of \u201cequivalent descriptions,\u201d the\ndistinction between differential and universal forces, the necessity\nof coordinating definitions and their \u201cconventionality,\u201d\nthe conventionality of spatial metrics and of \u201cmetrical\u201d\nsimultaneity, and the account of the logical structure of relativity\ntheories in terms of properties of causal relations in the\nAxiomatization. \n\nThe introduction to The Philosophy of Space and Time betrays\nthe Marxist inclinations Reichenbach retained from his student years.\nScience he says, has become mechanized, and develops so rapidly and\nautomatically that its practitioners cannot reflect on what they are\ndoing or why. (He might as well have said they are \u201calienated\nfrom their labor,\u201d but he did not.) A philosophical\ncounterweight (he might as well have said \u201cantithesis,\u201d\nbut he did not) is needed. The counterweight cannot be provided by\nindividuals announcing philosophical manifestos; it requires that\nphilosophers organize into groups so that, collectively, they can keep\nup with, and exercise analytic control over, the products of the\nscientific machine. The Vienna Circle, and Reichenbach\u2019s own\ngroup of philosophers and physicists in Berlin, are the models.\nTogether, philosophers should produce results, not\nmanifestos. This last demand was the conclusion of the editorial\nReichenbach placed in the first issue of Erkenntnis in 1930\n(Reichenbach, 1930a); Schlick and Carnap, his collaborators in\nfounding the journal, refused to sign the editorial, Schlick resigned\nentirely as an editor. \n\nThe book begins with a clear and compelling discussion of the\ninterdependence of properties and laws, illustrated through the\nrelations of alternative measures of length and alternative\ngeometries. The examples are then used to make two general claims,\nfirst that within the structure of complex theories there are\nidentifiable points that are definitions, and, second, that\nalternative systems of definitions and laws that account for the same\n\u201cfacts\u201d say the same thing, have the same content.\nReichenbach\u2019s \u201cdefinitions\u201d are not purely verbal,\nthey are \u201ccoordinative definitions\u201d that specify physical\nprocedures for determining the values of quantities. The point is\nreinforced with a distinction between differential and universal\nforces. Universal forces influence all objects in the same way (where\ntheory specifies what a \u201cway\u201d is) and cannot be shielded\nagainst. Heat, for example, is a differential force because it affects\nbodies of different compositions differently, whereas gravity is a\nuniversal force. A space with curvature can be equally described as a\nspace without curvature but with a universal force. Without explicit\nstatement, Reichenbach takes for granted the view, later defended in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c), that talk in coordinative\ndefinitions about ordinary, middle-sized, nearby physical objects and\nprocesses is intelligible and legitimate. \n\nReichenbach has a complex discussion of visualization. He introduces\nHelmholtz\u2019s idea that to visualize a geometry is to understand\nwhat experiences one would have in a world in which that geometry\nholds, and extends the idea to the visualization of spaces with\ncompact topologies, where, Reichenbach argues, Euclidean geometry\ncould be sustained but at the cost of causal anomalies. For example,\nin a toroidal space, travel on a geodesic would bring one back to\none\u2019s starting point, which, Reichenbach argues, would require\neither abandoning Euclid or else allowing \u201ccausal\nanomalies\u201d in the form of duplicate worlds at regular distances\nfrom one another. (By \u201cEuclidean\u201d geometry, Reichenbach\nmeans here a geometry on a manifold homeomorphic to\nR3, since there is a complete Euclidean metric for\ntoroidal 3-space.) Reichenbach gives other examples of causal\nanomalies but no general characterization. \n\nEven with Helmholtz available, Reichenbach is concerned to dispute\nfurther the very idea that Euclidean geometry has a privileged status\nin mathematical visualization that indicates some intrinsic limitation\nof thought. If humans had somehow been transported to a non-Euclidean\nworld, he says, they would have non-Euclidean\nvisualizations\u2014surely a puzzling counterfactual. The very idea\nthat \u201cpure visualization\u201d has some normative content is a\nmistake, he argues: \u201cthe normative function of visualization is\nnot of visual but of logical origin.\u201d (p. 91). We do not presume\nto know just what Reichenbach meant here, but for a plausible\nelucidation one might turn to recent philosophical work on the logical\nrelations implicit in geometrical diagrams. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of space and time begins with a near\nirony. Having argued against Kant\u2019s effort to justify the basics\nof Newtonian physics a priori, Reichenbach proceeds to argue that we\ncan know almost a priori that Newtonian theory is false. For\nexample, Newton does not distinguish between the length of a moving\nsegment and its length at rest, but according to Reichenbach, this is\nan a priori mistake: \u201cthe measurement of a segment with\na measuring rod that moves relative to it requires the\nformulation of a new concept\u2026The length of a moving\nline-segment is the distance between simultaneous positions of its\nendpoints.\u201d (p. 155) And further: \u201cIt follows from the\nnature of the extended concept of length that the length of a moving\nsegment is generally different from its rest-length.\u201d To say\nwhich is the true length is \u201cnonsense\u201d (p. 157). Thus is\nNewton refuted. \n\nMost of the rest of the book is a restatement of the\nAxiomatization with more extended examples and fewer proofs,\nand explicitly construed as a reduction of space time relations to\ncausal relations supplemented with definitions. The fundamental causal\nrelation to which Reichenbach appeals must be asymmetric and allow\nreidentification of objects or their features. Reichenbach thinks to\nobtain the asymmetry via a criterion of causation that invokes both\nthe preservation of something material and the asymmetry of\nintervention. A \u201cmark\u201d placed at the beginning of a causal\nprocess can be received at the end of the process; Reichenbach\u2019s\nexample is the color of a light signal. The asymmetry is that if the\nbeginning of the process is marked, the end of the process bears the\nmark, but if the end of the process is marked, the beginning\ndoes not bear the mark. The analysis thus depends on a distinction\nbetween observing a mark and the asymmetric relation of causing a\nmark. Reichenbach recognizes that for his empiricist, causal\nconstruction of the space metric, signals must be reidentifiable, a\nrelation he notes that Kurt Lewin had discussed (in his 1922\nHabilitationsschrift) as \u201cgenidentity\u201d (see also Padovani\n(2013)). Unsurprisingly, Reichenbach offers no guide to\nreidentification, which is obtained in all cases, including those of\nlight signals, from elaborate convictions\u2014or at least\nhabits\u2014about all kinds of details and regularities of the world.\nHad Reichenbach thought it necessary to his constructions in the\nAxiomatization first to establish empiricist criteria of\ngenidentity, the construction would not have begun. \n\nFurther Reading. Ryckman (2007) gives a more general overview\nof Reichenbach\u2019s philosophy of physics. Wilholt (2012, pp.\n44\u201348) provides a useful description of Reichenbach\u2019s\nconventionalism and Giovanelli (2016) discusses in great detail\nReichenbach\u2019s early views on the geometrization of physics by\ngeneral relativity which were at some point supposed to form an\nappendix to The Philosophy of Space and Time. The collection\nby Lutz & Tuboly (2021) contains several articles that provide\ncontext for Reichenbach\u2019s philosophy of physics.\n",
