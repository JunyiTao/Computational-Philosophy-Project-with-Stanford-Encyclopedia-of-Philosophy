    "main_text": "Three Jury Theorems || The Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem\n2.5 The Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem\n\nThe dilemma can be escaped with a jury theorem with more plausible\npremises and conclusions. Think of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as being\nrich enough to justify Conditional Independence; so \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)\ncontains the common causes, or a good enough proxy or substitute for\nthem.\n\nAlthough voters will be incompetent under some (unfortunate) instances\n\\(x\\) of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), they will plausibly be competent\nmost of the time, i.e., under most facts instances. This suggests\nreplacing Conditional Competence with the weaker premise of\nTendency to Competence. What is this axiom? It says that\ncompetence is more often high than low. More precisely, competence\nexceeds 0.5 by some amount at least as often as it falls below 0.5 by\nthis amount, for any positive amount. So, competence is 0.51 at least\nas often as 0.49; it is 0.55 at least as often as 0.45; etc. Formally,\nan individual \\(i\\)\u2019s specific competence\n\\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\) depends on the (random) facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\),\nhence is itself random. If its value exceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the\nfacts can be called truth-conducive or easy for\n\\(i\\); if its value is below \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the facts can be called\nmisleading or difficult for \\(i\\); if its value is\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the facts can be called neutral for \\(i\\),\nas they do not push in any direction. A discrete random number (such\nas specific competence \\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\)) tends to\nexceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) if, for each \\(\\epsilon>0\\), it equals\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon\\) at least as likely as\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. A competence distribution that\ntends to exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}.\\)\n\n[An\n extended description of Figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 2\n gives an example where specific competence (with values \\(0,\n\\frac{1}{8},\\) \\(\\frac{1}{4},\\) \\(\\frac{3}{8}, \\ldots, 1)\\) tends to\nexceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\): competence is \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) with higher\nprobably than \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\); it is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) with higher\nprobably than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\); etc. Visually, this makes the\ndistribution lean to the right.\n\nThis leads to the following jury theorem (Dietrich & Spiekermann\n2013a).\n\nPrimitives of the Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem: same as\nfor the Conditional Jury Theorem.\n\nTendency to Competence (TC): The conditional\ncorrectness probability \\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\)\u2014the specific\ncompetence\u2014tends to exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and is the same\nfor all individuals \\(i\\).\n\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem: Assuming CI and\nTC, the probability of majority correctness, \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\),\nincreases in\n (odd[9])\n group size \\(n\\) and converges to a value which is below 1 unless CC\nholds.\n\nWhat is the limit of majority correctness under CI and TC? It is the\nprobability that the facts (e.g., the shared evidence) are\ntruth-conducive plus half the probability that the facts are\n neutral.[10]\n Loosely speaking, group performance in the limit is as good as the\nfacts. Unsurprisingly, the group cannot beat the facts. It should\nalready count as a success to match the facts asymptotically.\n\nThe twofold evolution from the Conditional Jury Theorem is that the\ncompetence premise is weakened to TC and the infallibility conclusion\nis reversed. Therefore, majorities can be wrong even in asymptotically\nlarge bodies\u2014unless CC holds, i.e., unless voters are\nalways competent. \u201cUnless\u201d can be read strongly\nin the theorem, as meaning \u201cif and only if it is not\nthe case that\u201d.\n",
