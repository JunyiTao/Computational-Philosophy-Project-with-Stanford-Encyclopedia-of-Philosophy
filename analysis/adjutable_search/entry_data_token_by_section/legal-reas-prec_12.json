    "main_text": "Analogy || Reasons\n4.2 Reasons\n\n\nThe reasons-based approach to analogical reasoning focuses on the\njustifications for the analogical case (for two very different\naccounts see Raz 1979, 201\u20136 and Brewer 1996). It considers the\nextent to which the rationale for the decision in the earlier case is\napplicable to the case at hand. Take the case of the impersonation of\na boyfriend in the law of rape. Whether this situation is analogous to\nthe impersonation of a husband depends on the reasons for the latter\nvitiating consent. There need be no single principle that underlies\nthe rationale: it may rest on a number of factors that reinforce the\nconclusion.\n\n\nOne consequence of this approach is that if the rationale for the\nearlier decision is tied exclusively to the particular category used\nin the ratio, there will be no scope for analogical extension\nto broader categories. In English law duress is not a defence to\nmurder regardless of the circumstances, due (it is said) to the\nuniqueness of deliberate killing and the fact that duress is, at best,\nan excuse. On this rationale there is no room for arguing that duress\nshould be excluded in cases of physically disabling a victim. On the\nquestion of whether duress could be a partial defence to\nmurder, on the other hand, there is an arguable analogy to\nthe excuse of provocation, which operates to reduce murder to\nmanslaughter. Killing may be inexcusable, but that does not mean that\nevery deliberate killing warrants a conviction for murder. Of\ncourse, duress involves an actual decision to kill, whereas\nprovocation a temporary loss of self-control. The case for reducing\nkilling under duress to manslaughter depends upon whether the\nrationale for provocation (e.g. as a concession to human frailty)\nextends to it. Two factors\u2014the defendant's loss of\nself-control and the victim's involvement in the\nkilling\u2014readily distinguish the two situations, and weaken any\nanalogy.\n\n\nThe reasons-based approach helps to explain why individual cases, and\nindividual doctrines, can ground analogies. It also explains what is\naccurate in the principles-based approach, since some of the\nconsiderations underlying analogical cases will be principles.  But\nthere are more legal considerations than principles, and these too\nplay a role in analogical reasoning.\n",
