    "main_text": "The Commonplace Thesis Refined\n3. The Commonplace Thesis Refined\n\n\nThe notions of chance and randomness discussed and clarified in the\nprevious two sections are those that have proved scientifically and\nphilosophically most fruitful. Whatever misfit there may be between\nordinary language uses of these terms and these scientific\nprecisifications, is made up for by the usefulness of these concepts.\nThis is particularly so with the notion of randomness, chance being in\nphilosopher\u2019s mouths much closer to what we ordinarily take ourselves\nto know about chance. On these conceptions, randomness is\nfundamentally a product notion, applying in the first instance to\nsequences of outcomes, while chance is a process notion, applying in\nthe single case to the process or chance setup which produces a token\noutcome. Of course the terminology in common usage is somewhat\nslippery; it\u2019s not clear, for example, whether to count random\nsampling as a product notion, because of the connection with\nrandomness, or as a process notion, because sampling is a process. The\northodox view of the process, in fact, is that it should be governed\nby a random sequence; we enumerate the population, and sample an\nindividual \\(n\\) just in case the \\(n\\)-th outcome in a\npre-chosen random sequence is 1. (Of course the sample thus selected\nmay not be random in some intuitive sense; nevertheless, it will not\nbe biased because of any defect in the selection procedure, but rather\nonly due to bad luck.)\n\n\nWith these precise notions in mind, we can return to the Commonplace\nThesis CT connecting chance and randomness. Two readings make\nthemselves available, depending on whether we take single outcomes or\nsequences of outcomes to be primary:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{CTa}\\):\n\nA sequence of outcomes happens by chance iff that sequence is\nrandom.\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{CTb}\\):\n\nAn outcome happens by chance iff there is a random sequence of outcomes\nincluding it.\n\n\nGiven the standard probability calculus, any sequence of outcomes is\nitself an outcome (in the domain of the chance function defined over a\n\\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of outcomes, as in standard mathematical probability);\nso we may without loss of generality consider only (CTb). But a\nproblem presents itself, if we consider chancy outcomes in possible\nsituations in which only very few events ever occur. It may be that\nthe events which do occur, by chance, are all of the same type, in\nwhich case the sequence of outcomes won\u2019t be random. This problem is\nanalogous to the \u2018problem of the single case\u2019 for\n frequency views of chance\n (H\u00e1jek 2012:\n \u00a73.3),\n because\nrandomness is, like frequency, a property of an outcome sequence. The\nproblem arises because the outcomes may be too few or too orderly to\nproperly represent the randomness of the entire sequence of which they\nare part (all infinite random sequences have at least some non-random\ninitial subsequences). The most common solution in the case of\nfrequentism was to opt for a hypothetical outcome sequence\u2014a\nsequence of outcomes produced under the same conditions with a stable\nlimit frequency (von Mises 1957: 14\u20135). Likewise, we may refine\nthe commonplace thesis as follows:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{RCT}\\):\n\nAn outcome happens by chance iff, were the trial which generated that\noutcome repeated often enough under the same conditions, we would\nobtain a random sequence including the outcome (or of which the\noutcome is a subsequence).\n\n\nHere the idea is that chancy outcomes would, if repeated often\nenough, produce an appropriately homogenous sequence of outcomes which\nis random. If the trial is actually repeated often enough, this\nsequence should be the actual sequence of outcomes; the whole point of\nKolmogorov randomness was to permit finite sequences to be random.\n\n\nRCT is intuitively appealing, even once we distinguish process and\nproduct randomness in the way sketched above. It receives significant\nsupport from the fact that fair coins, tossed often enough, do in our\nexperience invariably give rise to random sequences, and that the\nexistence of a random sequence of outcomes is compelling evidence for\nchance. The truth of RCT explains this useful constraint on the\nepistemology of chance, since if we saw an actual finite random\nsequence, we could infer that the outcomes constituting that sequence\nhappened by chance. However, in the next two sections, we will see that\nthere are apparent counterexamples even to RCT, posing grave\n difficulties for the Commonplace Thesis. In\n \u00a74\n we\nwill see a number of cases where there are apparently chancy outcomes\n without randomness, while in\n \u00a75\n we will see cases\nof apparent randomness where there is no chance involved.\n\n\nA fundamental problem with RCT seems to emerge when we consider the\nfate of hypothetical frequentism as a theory of chance. For there\nseems to be no fact of the matter, in a case of genuine chance, as to\nwhat sequence of outcomes would result: as Jeffrey (1977: 193) puts\nit, \u2018there is no telling whether the coin would have landed head\nup on a toss that never takes place. That\u2019s what probability is all\nabout.\u2019 Many philosophers (e.g., H\u00e1jek 2009) have\nfollowed Jeffrey in scepticism about the existence and tractability of\nthe hypothetical sequences apparently required by the right hand side\nof RCT. However, there is some reason to think that RCT will fare\nbetter than hypothetical frequentism in this respect. In particular,\nRCT does not propose to analyse chance in terms of these\nhypothetical sequences, so we can rely on the law of large numbers to\nguide our expectation that chance processes produce certain outcome\nfrequencies, in the limit, with probability 1; this at least may\nprovide some reason for thinking that the outcome sequences will\nbehave as needed for RCT to turn out true. Even so, one might suspect\nthat many difficulties for hypothetical frequentism will recur for\nRCT. However, these difficulties stem from general issues with merely\npossible evidential manifestations of chance processes, and have\nnothing specifically to do with randomness. The objections canvassed\nbelow are, by contrast, specifically concerned with the interaction\nbetween chance and randomness. So these more general potential worries\nwill be set aside, though they should not be forgotten\u2014they may\neven be, in the end, the most significant problem for RCT (if the\nright kind of merely possible sequence doesn\u2019t exist, we must retreat\nto CTa or CTb and their problems).\n",
