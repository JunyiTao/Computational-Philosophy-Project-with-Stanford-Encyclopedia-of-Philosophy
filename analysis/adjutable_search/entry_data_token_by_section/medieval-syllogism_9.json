    "main_text": "Later Medieval Developments of the Theory\n10. Summary\n\nThe theory of the syllogism was the most important logical theory\nduring the Middle Ages and for a long time it was practically\nsynonymous with logic as a discipline. Buridan altered this picture by\nmaking syllogistic part of a much larger and more complex logic of\nconsequence. \n\nAt first, medieval commentators on Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nAnalytics sought to save what they took to be Aristotle\u2019s\noriginal system. Kilwardby thought this could be done by interpreting\nmodal sentences in light of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics of essence\ntogether with his account of essential prediction in the Posterior\nAnalytics. This was a very influential interpretation, but it was\nultimately abandoned because it did not succeed in saving\nAristotle.\n\nIn the early fourteenth century, Campsall tried to save Aristotle by\ndeveloping a more radical interpretation restricting the supposition\nof subject and predicate terms in modal sentences. This enabled him to\nprove the conversion rules and many of the syllogistic moods accepted\nby Aristotle, but not even this interpretation could make sense of the\nPrior Analytics.\n\nBy the second quarter of the fourteenth century, modal logic had begun\nto change and new distinctions were used to develop the theory of the\nmodal syllogism, such as the distinction between de dicto and\nde re modal sentences. Ockham was the first simply to abandon\nAristotle\u2019s theory in favor of a newer and more systematic account. He\nwas not quite successful, however, and it was left to Buridan to\nsubsume modal syllogistic as part of his larger project of\nsystematizing the whole of logic.\n\nThe history of syllogistic does not end with the Middle Ages, of\ncourse, but it is fair to say that the theory did not really change in\nthe six centuries since Buridan. What did change, and for the worse,\nwas people\u2019s knowledge of the original sources and hence also of the\nrichness and sophistication of medieval logic, a state of ignorance\nthat made the doctrine easy for logicians of the early twentieth\ncentury to ridicule.\n",
