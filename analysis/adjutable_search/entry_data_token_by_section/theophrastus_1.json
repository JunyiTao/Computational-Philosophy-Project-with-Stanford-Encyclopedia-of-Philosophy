    "main_text": "Logic\n2. Logic\n\nTheophrastus wrote more logical treatises than Aristotle, though most\nof them deal with topics similar to those of the Aristotelian\ntreatises. The fragments and later testimonies that have survived from\nhis contributions to logic are mainly to be found in the ancient\ncommentaries of Aristotle\u2019s logical works. Theophrastus is\nreported there to have improved over some parts of the Aristotelian\nsyllogistic, but he is also supposed to have introduced a number of\ninnovations, sometimes independently sometimes working together with\nhis colleague Eudemus of Rhodes.\n\nTheophrastus abandoned some of Aristotle\u2019s statements about\npropositions, and in particular his account of the quantifiers (see\nBrunschwig 1982; Mignucci 1998). He distinguished, for instance,\nbetween singular and particular propositions, maintaining that the\nformer are definite while the latter are indefinite; that is to say,\nhe considered propositions AiB and AoB to\nbe indefinite, because in cases such as \u201cSome man is\njust\u201d and \u201cNot every man is just\u201d the quantifier\npicks up at least one individual without specifying which one (frs.\n82A\u2013E FHS&G). Moreover, Theophrastus claimed that the\nproposition \u201cNot every B is A\u201d has a\ndifferent meaning from the proposition \u201cSome B is not\nA\u201d, since the latter means that there is at least one\nB which is not A, whereas the former implies that there\nare several Bs which are not As (fr. 83 FHS&G).\nFinally, he used the expression \u201cby transposition\u201d\n(kata metathesin / ek metathese\u014ds) to indicate\naffirmative propositions whose predicates are indefinite, e.g.,\n\u201cA man is not-just\u201d (frs. 87A\u2013F FHS&G), and he\nestablished the convertibility of universal negative sentences (frs.\n90A\u2013B FHS&G).\n\nTheophrastus is reported to have added to the four syllogisms of the\nfirst figure another five (Baralipton, Celantes, Dabitis,\nFapesmo, and Frisesomorum), which Aristotle had just\nmentioned in the second book of his Prior Analytics (frs.\n91A\u2013E FHS&G). In this way, he redefined the first figure, so\nthat it includes every syllogism in which the middle term is subject\nof one premise and predicate of the other. Furthermore, he put the\nsyllogisms of the second and third figure in a different order from\nthat chosen by Aristotle, listing them according to the type and\ncomplexity of the proof needed for reducing them to the syllogisms of\nthe first figure. For instance, his discussion of Ferison precedes\nthat of Bocardo, since the latter is proved by reductio ad\nabsurdum while the former by conversion of the minor premise\n(frs. 96A\u2013B FHS&G).\n\nMore interestingly, Theophrastus introduced the so-called\n\u201cprosleptic\u201d (kata prosl\u0113psin) syllogisms\nthat have prosleptic premises, i.e., propositions with three terms of\nwhich two are definite and the other indefinite (frs. 110A\u2013D\nFHS&G). The following are prosleptic premises:\n\nWhatever holds of all A, of all of that B\nholds.\nWhatever holds of all A, that holds of all B.\nA holds of all of that of all of which B\nholds.\n\n\nIn fact, these three types of prosleptic premises are used in\nconstructing three figures of prosleptic syllogisms, which are\ncomposed of one prosleptic and one categorical premise; for instance,\nthe following is a first figure prosleptic syllogism:\n\n\nWhatever holds of every man, of all of that substance holds.\n\n\nAnimal holds of every man.\n\n\nTherefore, substance holds of every animal.\n\n\n\nTheophrastus claimed that certain prosleptic premises were equivalent\nto categorical propositions; for instance, \u201cA holds of\nall of that of all of which B holds\u201d is equivalent to\n\u201cA holds of all B\u201d. Nevertheless, since\nthere are prosleptic premises that are not equivalent to categorical\npropositions, many prosleptic syllogisms cannot be reduced to\ncategorical syllogisms (see Lejewski 1961, 1976; Kneale and Kneale\n1972).\n\nThere has been a scholarly debate about whether Theophrastus\nrecognized arguments in modus ponens, modus tollens,\nmodus ponendo tollens and modus tollendo ponens:\n\nIf p, then q; but p; therefore\nq.\nIf p, then q; but not-q; therefore\nnot-p.\nEither p or q; but p; therefore\nnot-q.\nEither p or q; but not-q; therefore\np.\n\n\nWhile earlier commentators doubted that Theophrastus ever considered\nanything of the sort (see Boche\u0144ski 1947), recent scholars have\nmaintained that he studied such arguments, or at least that he studied\narguments which can be regarded as their forerunners (see Barnes 1985;\nMignucci 1998; Bobzien 2002, 2004). More specifically, our sources\nreport that Theophrastus and Eudemus, being inspired by\nAristotle\u2019s syllogisms \u201cfrom a hypothesis\u201d (ex\nhupothese\u014ds: Prior Analytics 1.44), discussed\n\u201chypothetical\u201d (hupothetikoi) syllogisms, i.e.,\narguments at least one of whose premises is hypothetical, that is a\nproposition compounded of at least two propositions.\nTheophrastus\u2019 hypothetical propositions mark either a\nconnectedness or a separateness, i.e., they are either conditional or\ndisjunctive propositions (with exclusive \u201cor\u201d), and his\nhypothetical syllogisms have the following forms (frs. 111\u2013112\nFHS&G):\n\n\n\nIf something is A, it is B.\n\n\na is A.\n\n\nTherefore, a is B.\n\n\n\n\nIf something is A, it is B.\n\n\na is not A.\n\n\nTherefore, a is not B.\n\n\n\n\nEither something is A or it is B.\n\n\na is A.\n\n\nTherefore, a is not B.\n\n\n\n\nEither something is A or it is B.\n\n\na is not A.\n\n\nTherefore, a is B.\n\n\n\n\nTheophrastus also considered relative quantified propositions such as\nthose containing \u201cmore\u201d, \u201cless\u201d and\n\u201cequal\u201d, and seems to have considered syllogisms built\nfrom such premises (fr. 111E FHS&G). But however innovative his\nadditions to Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic may have been,\nTheophrastus\u2019 hypothetical syllogisms cannot be said to form\npart of an elaborate and comprehensive system of propositional logic,\nand thus he cannot be credited with the invention of a logical\ncalculus similar to that of the Stoics.\n\nTheophrastus also developed the so-called \u201cwholly\nhypothetical\u201d (di\u2019 holou hypothetikoi)\nsyllogisms, which were abbreviated categorical arguments of the\nfollowing form (frs. 113A\u2013D FHS&G):\n\n\nIf [something is] A, [it is] B.\n\n\nIf [something is] B, [it is] C.\n\n\nTherefore, if [something is] A, [it is] C.\n\n\n\nIn parallel to the Aristotelian syllogistic, Theophrastus\ndistinguished three figures of wholly hypotheticals, each with sixteen\nmodes. He claimed that all second and third figure syllogisms could be\nreduced to first figure syllogisms, and he also regarded some of them\nas reducible to Aristotle\u2019s categorical syllogisms, presumably\nby way of the equivalence to \u201cEvery A is B\u201d\n(see Bobzien 2000).\n\nFinally, in modal logic, Theophrastus seems to have deviated from the\nAristotelian doctrine. In contrast to Aristotle, Theophrastus defined\npossibility as no longer entailing non-necessity (fr. 101 FHS&G).\nHe recognized that the problematic universal negative proposition\n\u201cA possibly holds of no B\u201d converts, just as\nthe assertoric universal negative and the necessary proposition do\n(frs. 102A\u2013C FHS&G). Furthermore, he introduced the in\npeiorem rule for mixed modal syllogisms, according to which the\nconclusion always has the same modal character as the weaker of the\npremises, assuming that possibility is weaker than actuality, and\nactuality is weaker than necessity (frs. 106\u2013107 FHS&G).\n\n",
