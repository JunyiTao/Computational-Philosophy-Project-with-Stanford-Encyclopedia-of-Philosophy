    "main_text": "Truth in Fiction || Impossible Fictions\n2.4 Impossible Fictions\n\nSome works of fiction describe scenarios that are impossible: not just\nphysically impossible (like fantasy stories), but metaphysically or\nlogically impossible (like certain time-travel stories and stories\nthat deny mathematical facts such as Ted Chiang\u2019s\n\u201cDivision by Zero\u201d, 1991). Early in his paper, Lewis\ncompletes Analyses 1 and 2 with the clause: \u201c\u2018In fiction\nF, \u03c6\u2019 is vacuously true iff there is no\npossible world where F is told as known fact\u201d. That\nclause implies that anything whatsoever is true in impossible stories.\nBut he then notes that some such stories involve venial\ncontradictions, contradictions due merely to a slip-up on the\nauthor\u2019s part (the Holmes stories, for example, since these\nsometimes locate Dr. Watson\u2019s old war wound in his leg and\nsometimes in his shoulder). To avoid the unpalatable conclusion that\nanything whatsoever is true in these stories as well, Lewis suggests\ntowards the end of \u201cTruth in Fiction\u201d that any such story\nshould be represented as a series of minimally revised consistent\nversions of the original, with truth in the story being truth in\nall the minimally revised consistent versions (Lewis 1978\n[1983: 274\u20135])\u2014what he later called the method of\nintersection. On this view, it is true in the stories that Dr. Watson\nhad a war-wound, but it is not true in the stories that he had one on\nhis shoulder and it is not true in the stories that he had one on his\nleg. \n\nPostscript B to the original article shows a change of mind. To\npreserve what he calls the \u201cdistinctive peculiarity of\ninconsistent fiction\u201d (Lewis 1983: 277), Lewis now suggests we\nadopt the method of union: what is true in a fiction is what\nis true in at least one consistent fragment, so that we can have\n\u201cIn fiction F, \\(\\phi\\)\u201d is true and \u201cIn fiction\nF, \\(\\neg \\phi\\)\u201d is true, but never \u201cIn fiction\nF, \\(\\phi \\land \\neg\\phi\\)\u201d is true. \n\nYet, as Lewis himself acknowledged, this account does not work with\nblatantly inconsistent stories whose contradictions are not venial,\nand with respect to these stories he takes a hard line: \u201cwe\nshould not expect to have a non-trivial concept of truth in blatantly\nimpossible fiction\u201d (Lewis 1978 [1983: 275). Many disagree,\noffering examples of such stories where the issue of truth and falsity\nappears to arise much as it does for consistent\nstories. Currie\u2019s (1990) example is of a story that turns on the\nhero\u2019s disproof of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\nresults. Such a story simply can\u2019t be divided into consistent\nfragments.  Similarly, consider Graham Priest\u2019s story of\nSylvan\u2019s Box, which involves the discovery of a box belonging to\nthe late Richard Sylvan that is at once empty and non-empty (Priest\n1997, 2005). (Other examples may include stories about donkeys that\ntalk and pigs who lead revolutions, as well as fictions in which\nactual people and fictional characters interact, for example,\nPirandello\u2019s Six Characters in Search of an Author\n[1921]; cf. Byrne 1993; Woodward 2011; for an even more radical take\non the inconsistency in fiction, see Woods 2018.) Some bite the\nLewisian bullet at this point. Hanley (2004), for example, argues that\nsome such fictions may be susceptible to the method of union; in other\ncases, the best way to interpret them is simply to doubt the\nreliability of their narrators. Nolan (2007) similarly argues that our\nintuitive judgment of what is true in the fiction in such cases tracks\nthe narrator\u2019s beliefs rather than the represented facts.\n\nMost writers agree, however, that there can be a coherent notion of\ntruth in fiction even for \u201cblatantly\u201d inconsistent\nfictions (see, for example, Byrne 1993; Le Poidevin 1995; Phillips\n1999; Gendler 2000; Weatherson 2004, Priest 2005, Proudfoot 2006). But\neven when there is agreement about this, there is no agreement about\nthe resources needed to capture such a notion of truth. Some think\nthat the best and perhaps most obvious solution to the problem of\ninconsistent fiction is a generalization of Lewis\u2019s own\napproach: we should admit appropriately selected impossible worlds to\nthe set of worlds that realize what is told in such a story (see\nPriest 1997, 2005; Woods 2003: ch. 6; Berto 2012: chs. 7, 8; Jago\n2014; cf. also the entry on\n impossible worlds).\n\n\nImpossible worlds, however, are for many a difficult pill to swallow.\nLewis himself makes a throwaway remark that might suggest a moderate\nalternative \u2013 he adds:\n\n\nor perhaps we should expect to have [a non-trivial concept of truth in\nblatantly impossible fiction] only under the pretense\u2014not to be\ntaken too seriously\u2014that there are impossible possible worlds as\nwell as possible possible worlds. (1978 [1983: 275]) \n\n\n(such a view would be a kind of extended modal fictionalism\u2014see\n\u00a71.5 of the entry on \n modal fictionalism).  \nLewis makes a further appeal to this idea in a letter to\nGraham Priest (9 January, 2001), although only to assert that the idea\nis of limited usefulness.  In his words,\n\n\nI agree with you about the many uses to which we could put\nmake-believedly possible impossibilities, if we are willing to use\nthem.  The trouble is that all these uses seem to require a\ndistinction between the subtle ones and the blatant ones (very likely\ncontext-dependent, very likely a matter of degree) and that is just\nwhat I don\u2019t understand.  (Lewis 2004: 177)\n\n\nCurrie\u2019s diagnosis of the problem of truth in impossible\nfictions is very different. He thinks that worlds simply constitute\nthe wrong currency for characterizing the notion of truth in fiction,\neven when authorial and community belief is added to the mix (as on\n Analysis 2).\n Currie thinks that once we understand the notion of truth in fiction\nin doxastic terms as what we can reasonably take the fictional author\nto believe\n (account C\n above), the case of radically inconsistent fiction presents no\nfurther problems. There is no bar, he thinks, to supposing that\nsomeone believes impossible propositions, even simple impossible\npropositions like \\(7+5 \u226012\\), and so there can be no objection to\nthe claim that even blatantly impossible propositions can be true in a\nwork of fiction. \n\nBut while this may work for the simplest cases, it is not clear that\nwe can be so sanguine about others. Thus, consider stories like\nGendler\u2019s story of the Tower of Goldbach in which \\(7+5 \u2260\n12\\) and \\(7+5=12\\) (Gendler 2000), or Priest\u2019s story of\nSylvan\u2019s box, empty and non-empty at the same time. It is one\nthing to allow that such contradictory propositions are both true in\nthe relevant story; understanding how it can be reasonable to\nattribute belief in both propositions to a fictional author may be\nmore difficult. Or consider a story in which everything whatsoever is\ntrue (imagine a story in which God or Sylvan discloses this to\nPriest). Even those who think that there is no bar to believing\nimpossible propositions are likely to reject as incoherent the thought\nthat someone can believe all propositions (cf. Priest 2000).\n\n\nNote that the problem of impossible fictions affects Walton\u2019s\nmake-believe account rather differently.  Truth in fiction for Walton\nis a function of prescriptions to imagine, and he is relatively\nsanguine about such prescriptions in the case of impossible fictions.\nEven contradictions, he suspects, can be imagined in the relevant\nsense, but he adds that even if they can\u2019t, his account of\nfictionality or fictional truth is safe.  He offers two options:\nfirst, there might be prescriptions to imagine a contradiction even if\nactually imagining it is not possible; secondly, there might be\nseparate prescriptions to imagine p and not-p, but not\ntheir conjunction (Walton 1990, 64\u20136).\n\nThe second way is an analogue of Lewis\u2019s method of intersection.\nPerhaps the first way is needed to deal with the case of blatant\ncontradictions, but as Walton notes even this is far from clear.\nWhile imagining a contradiction may well not be possible if\nimagination relies purely on mental imagery, the kind of imagining\ninvoked in fiction is very different: what is at stake here is\npropositional imagining and it is difficult to motivate the\nclaim that imagining even blatant contradictions is impossible.\nAttempts to do so tend to rest on quite contentious views of what\npropositional imagining must involve (cf. Everett 2013; cf. also Kung\n2016 on the telescopic versus stipulative views of imagining).\n",
