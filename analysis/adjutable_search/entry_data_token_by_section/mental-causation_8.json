    "main_text": "Problem I: Property Dualism\n4. Problem I: Property Dualism\n\nThis \u201cnew epiphenomenalism\u201d (Campbell 1984, ch. 7)\nimmediately confronts a particularly strong version of\n property dualism,\n one insisting that mental properties are sui generis,\nperhaps dependent on, but in no way reducible to the dispositional and\nstructural properties recognized by the physical sciences. Some\nproperty dualists accord this status only to a certain class of mental\nproperty, namely\n qualia,\n the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d features of conscious\nexperience. Other property dualists, including some\n emergentists,\n are willing to extend the thesis to all mental properties.\n\nSuppose that this robust form of property dualism is true. Can mental\nsubstances or events cause what they do qua mental, in virtue\nof their mental properties? The arguments against soul\u2013body\ninteraction, now couched in terms of properties, could enter again\nhere. For example, if you were worried about the mind\u2013body nexus\nfor souls (\u00a72.1), it seems you should also wonder how\nnon-physical properties can find any traction in the physical world.\nSimilarly, Completeness (\u00a72.4) seems to lose none of its\nattractiveness when formulated explicitly in terms of properties. You\ncould add to the principle a clause stipulating that a\n\u201csufficient physical cause\u201d is one that\u2019s sufficient\nin virtue of its physical properties (see also \u00a75.4). Bring in\nNo Overdetermination, and the efficacy of mental properties\nis again threatened. The arguments here and the responses to it are\nstructurally similar to those in \u00a72, so we will not pursue\nfurther this version of the property-based problem. (Property dualism\nalso faces the Exclusion Problem, to be discussed in \u00a76.)\n",
