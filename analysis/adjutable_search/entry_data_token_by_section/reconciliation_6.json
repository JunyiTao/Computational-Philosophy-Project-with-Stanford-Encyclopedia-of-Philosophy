    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Amnesties\n3.4 Amnesties\n\nAmnesties, which grant legal protection from civil and/or criminal\nliability, are a particularly controversial form of reconciliation\nprocess. Amnesty can be granted to individuals or classes of persons.\nIt can be granted unconditionally or conditionally. If conditional,\nthe granting of amnesty occurs only if certain provisions are met. For\nexample, in South Africa, perpetrators had to make a complete\ndisclosure of the rights violations for which they were responsible\nand demonstrate that such violations were committed for political\nreasons (Dyzenhaus 2000). Amnesties may also be conditional on\nnonrecidivism (Freeman 2011). Finally, amnesties vary in the extent to\nwhich they preclude other negative consequences (e.g., being fired)\n(Greenawalt 2000). \n\nA number of moral objections to amnesties have been raised. Amnesties\nseem at least prima facie unjust; specifically, amnesty\nprevents retributive and/or corrective justice from being done\n(Greenawalt 2000). Granting amnesty is claimed to be inimical to\ncountering historical impunity for political leaders and government\nagents responsible for egregious violations of human rights. And\nachieving the aspiration of \u201cNever Again\u201d seems\nintuitively less likely if future political leaders and actors believe\nthey will not be held accountable for their actions. The danger posed\nby amnesty policies is that, in failing to hold wrongdoers accountable\nand undermining the ability of victims to seek legal recourse for\ntheir harms, they may (inadvertently) send the message that the abuses\nof the past were not wrong or that the victims did not deserve better\ntreatment (Pensky 2008). Justified anger against the perpetrators will\nnot be exorcised, and may instead find expression in acts of\nrevenge.\n\nAmnesties continue to be used by states and in fact have increased in\nfrequency (Mallinder 2008). Communities adopt amnesties for a variety\nof reasons. Amnesties may encourage perpetrators to give full and\ntruthful testimony to truth commissions. Here, the value of\nremembering the past is emphasized. In contrast, as in Cambodia,\namnesties can be used as part of a strategy to forget the past.\nAmnesties also may be used to incentivize an end to conflict, as was\nthe case in South Africa (Dyzenhaus 2000).\n\nArguments for the moral permissibility of amnesty challenge the idea\nthat granting amnesty reinforces impunity or undermines stability and\njustice (Mallinder 2008). Freeman (2011) claims that amnesties can be\njustified as a measure of last resort, so long as victims are included\nin the process of deciding to pass an amnesty and amnesties are used\nfor the sake of facilitating an end to conflict or reconciliation.\nGreenawalt (2000) argues that amnesties can be justified when\nnecessary to prevent even greater injustice from occurring, such as\nviolations of human rights as part of an ongoing conflict. By\ndemonstrating mercy to perpetrators, amnesties might help end a cycle\nof violence (O\u2019Shea 2002).\n",
