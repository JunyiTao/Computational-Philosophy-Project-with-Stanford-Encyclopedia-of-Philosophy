    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Applied Phenomenology: Art and Aesthetics\n3.1 Applied Phenomenology: Art and Aesthetics\n\nAccording to a phenomenological theme that Henry traces back to\nHusserl and Heidegger, the world is not limited to any existing world,\nbut includes in itself the possibility of creating new fields of\nexperience for the human. Art would thus be such a possibility,\ninsofar as the artist surpasses \u201chabitual facticity\u201d and\nestablishes through the work of art a dimension of being that is\n\u201cabsolutely specific\u201d and \u201coriginal\u201d. Above\nall art reveals, through its ability to create a new ontological\ndimension, a more fundamental reality than the world itself, namely\n\u201cthe possibility of world\u201d as such. In this sense, art\nreveals that which is ordinarily concealed: \u201ca pure appearing\nthat brings things into visibility\u201d (AP 284). In other words, if\nthings are given to us in an immediate way\u2014when we perceive\nbodies and, to a certain extent, our own body\u2014such thematic\ngivenness is only possible because space is given in a non-thematic\nway, as Kant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic already emphasizes.\nSpace is, therefore, not what we perceive but that which allows\nperception. As Henry argues, this is the kind of role that Heidegger\nattributes to the world insofar as it is not the sum of beings\nanymore, but the condition of their appearing. Thus, by creating\n\u201ca world\u201d, art reveals precisely this form of original\nappearing. Beyond the things perceived, art \u201cmake[s] us see\nthe appearing that conceals itself and in which the thing unveils\nitself\u201d (AP 284).\n\nHenry follows Heidegger here so far as to say that art reveals an\noriginal appearing. But he opposes Heidegger in at least two essential\npoints: 1) The idea that the world of art is a world apart from\nordinary experience; and 2) The idea that the original appearing is\nthe appearing of a world. With regard to the first point, Henry\nobserves that the rise of art as a separate domain is historically\nsituated in modernity. Such a separation did not exist when some of\nhumanity\u2019s greatest art works were created, the temples of\nancient Greece or the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, for instance. The\nfunction of these edifices was to serve as a place where the divine\ncould be worshipped, and the divine was the chief concern of those who\nconceived them, not beauty. As Henry concludes, it is only through our\nretrospective glance and through the projection of our own\n20th-century concept of art that we find these works\nbeautiful; and beauty has even become the only thing we are capable of\nfinding in them \u201csince we have lost their original\nmeaning\u201d, i.e., \u201csince we do not anymore see a temple as\nan access to the sacred essence of things, but as a work of art\u201d\n(AP 285\u20136).\n\nBut Henry\u2019s highlighting of the religious origin of art is also\nconnected to the question of the original appearing that is unveiled\nby art. In his critique of Heidegger, Henry distinguishes between\nBeing and Time, on the one hand, and Heidegger\u2019s later\ntexts that were influenced by H\u00f6lderlin and Nietzsche on the\nother. With regard to Being and Time, Henry\u2019s\nopposition is clearly marked: \u201cthe original appearing is not the\none that Heidegger thought of, it is not the world\u201d, which means\nthat \n\n\nit is not an ek-static appearing [\u2026], it is therefore not an\nhorizon, but what I call Life, i.e., a revelation\nthat is not the revelation of an other, that does not open to an\nexteriority, but that opens to itself. (AP 286) \n\n\nThe original appearing to which art refers is the immanent\nself-appearing of life given through auto-affection or pathos. In a\nfundamental sense for Henry, such affective appearing is given in\nsuffering and joy as basic tonalities. With regard to\nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s and Nietzsche\u2019s reference to the Greek\ngods, this means that Dionysus has to be seen as the \u201cfirst\ngod\u201d, since he is the god of desire, of life tied to itself in\nboth suffering and joy (AP 287). Moreover, Dionysus \u201chas no\nworld\u201d but suffers the burden of his own pathos from which he\nseeks to escape by generating Apollo, i.e., the god of light and,\nthus, the hope of distancing oneself from pathos. Here art becomes a\nsource of light, a figure through which Dionysus strives to escape\nfrom suffering. This is not, however, Henry\u2019s concept of art: it\nis through the influence of Kandinsky\u2019s writings that he\nconceives of art as an \u201cintensification of life\u201d (AP 296),\nwhere life is understood as auto-affection and original appearing.\n",
