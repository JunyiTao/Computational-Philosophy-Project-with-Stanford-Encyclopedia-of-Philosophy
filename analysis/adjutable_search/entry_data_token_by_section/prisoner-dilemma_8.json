Asynchronous Moves and Trust Games\n\nIt has often been argued that rational self-interested players can\nobtain the cooperative outcome by making their moves conditional on\nthe moves of the other player. Peter Danielson, for example, favors a\nstrategy of reciprocal cooperation: if the other player would\ncooperate if you cooperate and would defect if you don't, then\ncooperate, but otherwise defect. Conditional strategies like this are\nruled out in the versions of the game described above, but they may be\npossible in versions that more accurately model real world situations.\nIn this section and the next, we consider two such versions. In this\nsection we eliminate the requirement that the two players move\nsimultaneously. Consider the situation of a firm whose sole competitor\nhas just lowered prices. Or suppose the buyer of a car has just paid\nthe agreed purchase price and the seller has not yet handed over the\ntitle. We can think of these as situations in which one player has to\nchoose to cooperate or defect after the other player has already made\na similar choice. The corresponding game is an asynchronous\nor extended PD.\n\nCareful discussion of an asynchronous PD example, as Skyrms (1998) and\nVanderschraaf recently note, occurs in the writings of David Hume,\nwell before Flood and Dresher's formulation of the ordinary PD. Hume\nwrites about two neighboring grain farmers:\n\nYour corn is ripe today; mine will be so tomorrow. \u2019Tis\nprofitable for us both, that I shou'd labour with you to-day, and that\nyou shou'd aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for you, and know you\nhave as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains on your\naccount; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in\nexpectation of a return, I know I shou'd be disappointed, and that I\nshou'd in vain depend upon your gratitude. Here then I leave you to\nlabour alone: You treat me in the same manner. The seasons change; and\nboth of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and\nsecurity.\n\n\nIn deference to Hume, Skyrms and Vanderschraaf refer to this kind of\nasynchronous PD as the \u201cfarmer's dilemma.\u201d It is\ninstructive to picture it in a tree diagram.\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nHere, time flows to the right. The node marked by a square indicates\nPlayer One's choice point, those marked by circles indicate Player\nTwo's. The moves and the payoffs to each player are exactly as in the\nordinary PD, but here Player Two can choose his move according to what\nPlayer One does. Tree diagrams like Figure 5 are said to be\nextensive-form game representations, whereas the payoff\nmatrices given previously are normal-form representations. As\nHume's analysis indicates, making the game asynchronous does not\nremove the dilemma. Player One knows that if he were to choose \\(\\bC\\)\non the first move, Player Two would choose \\(\\bD\\) on the second move\n(since she prefers the temptation to the reward), so he would himself\nend up with the sucker payoff. If Player One were to choose \\(\\bD\\),\nPlayer Two would still choose \\(\\bD\\) (since she prefers the\npunishment to the sucker payoff), and he would end up with the\npunishment payoff. Since he prefers the punishment payoff to the\nsucker payoff, Player One will choose \\(\\bD\\) on the first move and\nboth players will end up with the punishment payoff. This kind of\n\u201cbackward\u201d reasoning, in which the players first evaluate\nwhat would happen on the last move if various game histories were\nrealized, and use this to determine what would happen on preceding\nmoves applies quite broadly to games in extensive form, and a more\ngeneral version of it will be discussed under finite\niteration below.\n\nThe farmer's dilemma can be represented in normal form by\nunderstanding Player One to be choosing between \\(\\bC\\) and \\(\\bD\\)\nand Player Two to be (simultaneously) choosing among four conditional\nmoves: cooperate unconditionally \\((\\bCu)\\), defect unconditionally\n\\((\\bDu)\\), imitate Player One's move \\((\\bI)\\), and do the opposite\nof Player One's move \\((\\bO)\\). The result is a two player game with\nthe following matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bCu\\)\n\\(\\bDu\\)\n\\(\\bI\\)\n\\(\\bO\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(R,R\\)\n\\(S,T\\)\n\\(R,R\\)\n\\(S,T\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(T,S\\)\n\\(P,P\\)\n\\(P,P\\)\n\\(T,S\\)  \n\n\nThe reader may note that this game is a (multiple-move) equilibrium\ndilemma. The sole (weak) nash equilibrium results when Player One\nchooses \\(\\bD\\) and Player Two chooses \\(\\bDu\\), thereby achieving for\nthemselves the inferior payoffs of \\(P\\) and \\(P\\). The game is not,\nhowever, a dominance PD. Indeed, there is no dominant move for either\nplayer. It is commonly believed that rational self-interested players\nwill reach a nash equilibrium even when neither player has a dominant\nmove. If so, the farmer's dilemma is still a dilemma.\n\nTo preserve the symmetry between the players that characterizes the\nordinary PD, we may wish to modify the asynchronous game. Let us take\nextended PD to be played in stages. First each player chooses a first\nmove \\((\\bC \\text{ or } \\bD)\\) and a second move \\((\\bCu, \\bDu, \\bI,\n\\text{ or } \\bO)\\). Next a referee determines who moves first, giving\neach player an equal chance. Finally the outcome is computed in the\nappropriate way. For example, suppose Row plays \\((\\bD, \\bO)\\)\n(meaning that he will defect if he moves first and do the opposite of\nhis opponent if he moves second) and Column plays \\((\\bC, \\bDu)\\).\nThen Row will get \\(P\\) if he goes first and \\(T\\) if he goes second,\nwhich implies that his expected payoff is \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}(P+T)\\).\nColumn will get \\(S\\) if she goes first and \\(P\\) if she goes second,\ngiving her an expected payoff of \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}(P+S)\\). It is\nstraightforward, but tedious, to calculate the entire eight by eight\npayoff matrix. After doing so, the reader may observe that, like the\nfarmer's dilemma, the symmetric form of the extended PD is an\nequilibrium PD, but not a dominance PD. The sole nash equilibrium\noccurs when both players adopt the strategy \\((\\bD, \\bDu)\\), thereby\nachieving the inferior payoffs of \\((P,P)\\).\n\nSome particularly simple and suggestive variations of on this theme\nhave been studied under the labels \u201cinvestor game\u201d or\n\u201ctrust game\u201d (See, for example, Kreps (1990), Berg (1995)\nand Bicchieri and Suntuoso (2015) and note that the game nomenclature\nis not consistent accross these references.) Player One is given \\(s\\)\nunits of utility. He may choose to pass any number \\(s\\prime \\lt s\\)\nto a \u201ctrustee\u201d, who triples that number and passes it to\nPlayer Two. Player Two may then either keep the units that she has or\nreturn some of them to Player One. So formulated, the game has the\nadvantage that one can take the proportion of her utility that a\nplayer surrenders as her degree of cooperativeness. If one\nrestricts the moves so that Player One may give none or \\(s\\), and\nPlayer Two may give none or \\(2s\\) one gets exactly the farmer's\ndilemma). \n\nIn the farmer's dilemma and the trust game, unlike the PD, the\nsimilarly-labeled moves of the two players seem to have somewhat\ndifferent flavors. We are more likely to regard Player One's\ncooperation as generous or perhaps calculated (even\nif we regard the calculations involved to be irrational), and Player\nTwo's as fair. The label trusting is appropriate\nonly with regard to Player One's cooperative move, though Player Two's\ncooperation might be thought to show her to be worthy of that\ntrust.\n\nIt may be worth noting that an asynchronous version of the stag hunt,\nunlike the PD, presents few issues of interest. If the first player\ndoes his part in the hunt for stag on day one, the second should do\nher part on day two. If he hunts hare on day one, she should do\nlikewise on day two. The first player, realizing this, should hunt\nstag on day one. So rational players should have no difficulty\nreaching the cooperative outcome in the asynchronous stag hunt.\n",
