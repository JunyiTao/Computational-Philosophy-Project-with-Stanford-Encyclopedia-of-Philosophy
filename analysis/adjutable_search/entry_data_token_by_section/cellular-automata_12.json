    "main_text": "CA and Philosophy || CA and Free Will\n3.2 CA and Free Will \n\nPhilosophers have debated the relationship between determinism and\nfree will for over two millennia. Two opposite stances can be taken\ntowards the problem: compatibilism maintains that free will\nis compatible with a deterministic world, which\nincompatibilism denies (see the entries on\n free will\n and\n compatibilism).\n Surprisingly enough, both Daniel Dennett and Stephen Wolfram argued\nthat adopting the CA perspective can provide a solution, or perhaps a\ndissolution, of the longstanding mystery of free will.\n\nA major obstacle to accepting compatibilism is our persuasion that\ndeterminism implies inevitability (Dennett 2003: 25). We may thus make\ncompatibilism palatable by exhibiting an intuitive counterexample to\nthat conviction: a deterministic world in which, however, not\neverything is inevitable, i.e., something is avoidable (Ibid: 56).\nDennett maintains that CA can do this. He takes Life as a\nvivid illustration of how, in a deterministic but complex enough\nworld, we can abstract away from the bottom level and the micro-laws\ndeterministically governing it, and describe what is happening by\ntaking the emergent level seriously. Recall the eater-glider dynamics:\n\n\n\nAn Eater devouring a Glider\n\n\n\n\\(t_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_4\\)\n\n\n\nAt \\(t_0\\), an observer aiming at predicting the evolution of this\nspace-time region has basically two choices: she can take into account\n(what Dennett calls) the physical level, and compute pixel by\npixel the value of each cell state at each time step; or, she can\nfocus on the design level, and employ high-level concepts\nsuch as those of glider and eater to ground her\npredictions (Dennett 2003: 39). The first option is perfectly\ndeterministic, but has a flaw: it is time consuming, in such a way\nthat, by the time you have made the required computation, the world\nhas already evolved (this is especially true of a universal\nCA\u2014as we have already hinted at above, and shall expand on\nsoon). The second option is much faster: you know without much\ncalculation what is going to happen to a glider meeting an eater. The\npredictions though, cannot be 100% reliable: \n\n\nWhereas at the physical level, there are absolutely no exceptions to\nthe general law, at the design level our generalizations have to be\nhedged: they require \u201cusually\u201d clauses (\u2026). Stray\nbits of debris from earlier events can \u201cbreak\u201d or\n\u201ckill\u201d one of the objects in the ontology at this level.\nTheir salience as real things is considerable, but not guaranteed.\n(Dennett 2003: 40)\n\n\nDennett\u2019s point is that avoidance itself is a\nhigh-level concept. As such, it is compatible with a deterministic\nbottom level (because the concepts at the emergent level are, by\ndesign, independent from the micro-laws). The physical\ndescription and the design description of Life\nare different interpretations of the same basic ontology, namely, the\nsparse ontology of CA. While in theory we could avoid the introduction\nof emergent concepts, in practice it is only by speaking of gliders,\nmovements and avoidance that we can make sense of the evolution of the\nsystem (Dennett 2003: 43\u201344). Even without knowing\nLife\u2019s physics, we could do a good job if we predicted\nthe future by mentioning only high level patterns. Life is\njust a toy universe but, Dennett claims, these new intuitions are\nsufficient to see that, in some deterministic worlds, something is\navoidable. For instance, it is true at the design level that gliders\nactually avoid eaters. Thus, the inference from determinism to\ninevitability can be blocked. \n\nA reply to Dennett\u2019s argument consists in denying that\nLife-avoidance is real avoidance. Dennett himself puts a\nversion of this argument in the mouth of Conrad, a fictional skeptic\nphilosopher discussing Dennett\u2019s idea throughout his book: \n\n\nIt may look like avoidance, but it\u2019s not real avoidance. Real\navoidance involves changing something that was going to happen into\nsomething that doesn\u2019t happen. (Dennett 2003: 58)\n\n\nRephrasing Dennett\u2019s example, we can identify an ambiguity in\nConrad\u2019s argument. Imagine that a baseball is going to\nhit you in the face\u2014but you dodge it: a clear case of\nreal human avoidance. In what sense was the baseball\n\u201cgoing to\u201d hit you in the face? (Dennett 2003: 59) One\nmight say that it was never really going to hit you,\nprecisely because it triggered the reaction of whatever\n\u201cavoidance system\u201d you have. What is the difference\nbetween this avoidance and Life-avoidance? For Dennett, this\nis not a difference in kind, but in complexity: gliders and humans\nboth have avoidance systems, but human systems are much more\nsophisticated. The choice of a universal CA as a toy universe allows\nus to draw a stronger conclusion: since we know that Life is\nequivalent to a universal Turing machine, as explained above, some\npatterns in that universe may display avoidance systems at least as\ncomplex as ours. Dennett claims that compatibilism has thus won the\nfirst round: \n\n\nyou agree that (\u2026) I\u2019ve shifted the burden of proof:\nthere shall be no inferring inevitability in any sense from\ndeterminism without mounting a supporting argument. (Dennett 2003: 61)\n\n\n\nStephen Wolfram addresses the phenomenon of free will in his book on\nCA, with an ambitious tone:\n\n\nFrom the discoveries in this book it finally now seems possible to\ngive an explanation for this [free will]. And the key, I believe, is\nthe phenomenon of computational irreducibility. (Wolfram 2002:\n750)\n\n\nWe have introduced the issue of computational (or algorithmic)\nirreducibility when we explained the philosophical consequence of a\nuniversality proof for an automaton, namely that, although a system\nfollows definite underlying laws, \u201cits overall behavior can\nstill have aspects that fundamentally cannot be described by\nreasonable laws\u201d (Wolfram 2002: 750). This is again the issue of\npredictability via step by step micro-computations. In this\n\u201cseparation between the underlying rules for the system and its\noverall behavior\u201d (Wolfram 2002: 751) lies the secret of free\nwill, since it seems that we attribute free will to a system just when\n\u201cwe cannot readily make predictions about the behavior of the\nsystem\u201d (Wolfram 2002: 751). According to Wolfram, CA play a\nleading role in providing a new framework to understand the\nphenomenon. While explanations from chaos theory and quantum\nrandomness have recently been proposed (see the entry on\n chaos),\n \u201cnothing like this is actually needed\u201d (Wolfram 2002:\n752). By observing CA, we can understand how something with simple and\ndefinite micro-rules, like those governing our neurons, can produce a\nbehavior free of obvious rules: \n\n\nthe crucial point is that this happens just through the intrinsic\nevolution of the system\u2014without the need for any additional\ninput from outside or from any sort of explicit source of randomness.\n(Wolfram 2002: 752) \n\n\nWolfram\u2019s point is similar to some of Dennett\u2019s remarks,\nnamely: taking some sort of \u201cdesign stance\u201d, Wolfram\nsuggests that one can talk about a cellular automaton as if it just\n\u201cdecides\u201d to do this or that\u2014\u201cthereby\neffectively attributing to it some sort of free will\u201d (Wolfram\n2002: 752). One easily sees the closeness to Dennett\u2019s famous\nintentional stance (Dennett 1987; see the entry on\n intentionality,\n esp. Section 9).\n\nHow important are CA to these accounts? Dennett and Wolfram both use\nCA as intuition pumps. However, their positions seem to be slightly\ndifferent. For while the former sees CA as a \u201cuseful\ntoolkit\u201d to develop intuitions and vividly illustrate his\narguments (Dennett 2003: 40), the latter claims that CA provides a\n\u201cnew kind of intuition\u201d, one that \u201cno branch of\neveryday experience\u201d could provide (Wolfram 2002: 41). \n\nThe importance Wolfram attaches to CA seems to rely on a single,\ngeneric \u201cindispensability argument\u201d to the conclusion that\nCA justify the foundation of \u201ca new kind of science\u201d\n(Wolfram 2002: 7\u201316). We can reconstruct this argument as\nfollows:\n\n(NKS1)\n The observation of CA evolution leads to a scientific discovery:\n\u201cvery simple rules produce highly complex behavior\u201d\n(Wolfram 2002: 39).\n(NKS2)\n This discovery\u2014the \u201cnew\nintuition\u201d\u2014promises to explain old and new phenomena and\nuncover important regularities.\n(NKS3)\n Therefore, the core of our current scientific practices (based on\nthe \u201cold intuition\u201d) should be radically changed to\naccommodate this discovery.\n\n\n (NKS1)\n is to be taken at face value. It entails that the concepts involved\nwere not previously known. Wolfram talks in terms of \u201cthe single\nmost surprising scientific discovery I have ever made\u201d (Wolfram\n2002: 27). Is\n (NKS1)\n true? For sure, the idea that a deterministic and simple system may\nproduce unpredictable behavior started circulating in the scientific\ncommunity well before Wolfram\u2019s work. Signs of what is now chaos\ntheory can be traced back to the 19th and early 20th century, e.g., to\nthe work of Poincar\u00e9 1914. One might grant that CA allowed the\ndiscovery that simple systems may produce complex\nbehavior via the proof that they have unpredictable emergent\ncomputational complexity (although this discovery itself, as outlined\nin our brief historical section, was not made but only greatly\npublicized by Wolfram). Why was this discovery not made earlier?\nWolfram\u2019s own diagnosis is twofold: on the one hand, we have the\n\u201cengineering\u201d intuition that to produce something complex\nwe should build something complex\u2014that is because this is how\nordinary machines work. On the other, CA were not obviously connected\nto any established discipline, and therefore they were not studied in\nacademic circles. \n\nAs for\n (NKS2),\n we just examined the case of free will. In Wolfram\u2019s\nperspective, free will looks just like another puzzling philosophical\nphenomenon explained away by the advance of (a new kind of) science.\nJust as life was puzzling before the discovery of the double helix,\nfree will was puzzling before the discovery of a suitable scientific\ntheory, one that can finally account for the separation between micro\nand macro level. Many reductionist philosophers are no strangers to\nthis kind of argument. The concepts and intuitions used in\ncontemporary philosophy are often rooted in current scientific\npractices. When groundbreaking discoveries are made, old arguments may\nbe revised: troublesome concepts become harmless and new challenges\nare introduced. From this perspective, Wolfram\u2019s account of the\nfree will problem may lack philosophical rigor, but it is a promising\nstart to re-address the challenge armed with new scientific models of\ndeterminism and complexity\u2014pretty much as Dennett does. While\nmany successful applications are needed to fully vindicate\n (NKS2),\n our first assessment concludes that, at the very least, it is not\nobviously false. As for the \u201cnew regularities\u201d promised by\n (NKS2),\n we will address them in the next section. \n",
