    "main_text": "Transcendental idealism\n3. Transcendental idealism\n\nPerhaps the central and most controversial thesis of the Critique\nof Pure Reason is that human beings experience only appearances,\nnot things in themselves; and that space and time are only subjective\nforms of human intuition that would not subsist in themselves if one\nwere to abstract from all subjective conditions of human intuition.\nKant calls this thesis transcendental\n idealism.[7]\n One of his best summaries of it is arguably the following:\n\nWe have therefore wanted to say that all our intuition is nothing but\nthe representation of appearance; that the things that we intuit are\nnot in themselves what we intuit them to be, nor are their relations\nso constituted in themselves as they appear to us; and that if we\nremove our own subject or even only the subjective constitution of the\nsenses in general, then all constitution, all relations of objects in\nspace and time, indeed space and time themselves would disappear, and\nas appearances they cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What\nmay be the case with objects in themselves and abstracted from all\nthis receptivity of our sensibility remains entirely unknown to us. We\nare acquainted with nothing except our way of perceiving them, which\nis peculiar to us, and which therefore does not necessarily pertain to\nevery being, though to be sure it pertains to every human being. We\nare concerned solely with this. Space and time are its pure forms,\nsensation in general its matter. We can cognize only the former a\npriori, i.e., prior to all actual perception, and they are therefore\ncalled pure intuition; the latter, however, is that in our cognition\nthat is responsible for its being called a posteriori cognition, i.e.,\nempirical intuition. The former adheres to our sensibility absolutely\nnecessarily, whatever sort of sensations we may have; the latter can\nbe very different.\n (A42/B59\u201360)[8]\n\n\nKant introduces transcendental idealism in the part of the\nCritique called the Transcendental Aesthetic, and scholars\ngenerally agree that for Kant transcendental idealism encompasses at\nleast the following claims:\n\nIn some sense, human beings experience only appearances, not\nthings in themselves.\nSpace and time are not things in themselves, or determinations of\nthings in themselves that would remain if one abstracted from all\nsubjective conditions of human intuition. [Kant labels this conclusion\na) at A26/B42 and again at A32\u201333/B49. It is at least a crucial\npart of what he means by calling space and time transcendentally ideal\n(A28/B44, A35\u201336/B52)].\nSpace and time are nothing other than the subjective forms of\nhuman sensible intuition. [Kant labels this conclusion b) at A26/B42\nand again at A33/B49\u201350].\nSpace and time are empirically real, which means that\n\u201ceverything that can come before us externally as an\nobject\u201d is in both space and time, and that our internal\nintuitions of ourselves are in time (A28/B44,\nA34\u201335/B51\u201351).\n\n\nBut scholars disagree widely on how to interpret these claims, and\nthere is no such thing as the standard interpretation of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism. Two general types of interpretation have been\nespecially influential, however. This section provides an overview of\nthese two interpretations, although it should be emphasized that much\nimportant scholarship on transcendental idealism does not fall neatly\ninto either of these two camps.\n",
