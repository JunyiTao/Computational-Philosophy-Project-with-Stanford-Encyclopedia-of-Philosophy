    "main_text": "Indexicals\n3. Indexicals\n\nWe\u2019ve now seen two basic models of how words refer to things. On the\ndescriptivist model, words refer by being associated, somehow, with a\ndescription that serves to isolate a particular object as the\nreferent. Different versions of this model derive from different ways\nof associating the relevant descriptions with particular uses of\nwords. On the causal model, in contrast, words are associated with\nchains of use that lead back to some original act of dubbing. That act\nitself then serves to bridge the gap between word and world. While\nboth these models were developed with names in mind, we should ask\nourselves \u201cCan either serve to explain linguistic reference\nin general? That is, can either model plausibly extend to\nother sorts of referential terms, beyond just names?\u201d\n\nTo answer this question, and ultimately to introduce a third distinct\nmodel of linguistic reference, we turn now to the indexicals. That is,\nwe turn to terms like \u2018I\u2019, \u2018you\u2019,\n\u2018here\u2019, \u2018now\u2019, \u2018he\u2019,\n\u2018she\u2019, \u2018this\u2019, and \u2018that\u2019. As\nwe\u2019ll soon see, it is hardly clear that all indexicals refer\nin the same way. In particular, a distinction has often been drawn\nbetween what are called \u2018pure\u2019 and \u2018impure\u2019\nindexicals, with rather different theories of reference being offered\nfor each. The challenges that arise in trying to offer accounts of the\nimpure indexicals will bring us full circle to one of the questions\nwith which we began: namely, do words refer because we use them to do\nso, or rather do we use them to do so because they already refer?\n",
