Revised Hilbert Programs\n\nEven if no finitary consistency proof of arithmetic can be given, the\nquestion of finding consistency proofs is nevertheless of value: the\nmethods used in such proofs, although they must go beyond\nHilbert\u2019s original sense of finitism, might provide genuine\ninsight into the constructive content of arithmetic and stronger\ntheories. What G\u00f6del\u2019s result showed was that there can be\nno absolute consistency proof of all of mathematics; hence work in\nproof theory after G\u00f6del concentrated on relative results, both:\nrelative to the system for which a consistency proof was given, and\nrelative to the proof methods used.\n\nReductive proof theory in this sense has followed two traditions: the\nfirst, mainly carried out by proof theorists following Gentzen and\nSch\u00fctte, has pursued a program of what is called ordinal\nanalysis, and is exemplified by Gentzen\u2019s first consistency\nproof of \\(\\PA\\) by induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0 . \\varepsilon_0\\)\nis a certain transfinite (though countable) ordinal, however,\n\u201cinduction up\nto \\(\\varepsilon_0\\)\u201d in the sense used\nhere is not a genuinely transfinite procedure. Ordinal analysis does\nnot operate with infinite ordinal numbers, but rather with ordinal\nnotation systems which themselves can be formalized in very weak\n(essentially, finitary) systems. An ordinal analysis of a system \\(T\\)\nis given if: (a) one can produce an ordinal notation system which\nmimics the ordinals less than some ordinal \\(\\alpha_T\\) so that (b) it\ncan be proved finitarily that the formalization \\(TI(\\alpha_T)\\) of\nthe principle of induction up to \\(\\alpha_T\\) implies the consistency\nof \\(T\\) (i.e., \\(S \\vdash TI(\\alpha_T)\\rightarrow Con_T)\\) and (c)\n\\(T\\) proves \\(TI(\\beta)\\) for all \\(\\beta \\lt \\alpha_T\\) (\\(S\\) is a\ntheory formalizing finitary metamathematics and is generally a weak\nsub-theory of \\(T)\\). To have any foundational significance it is also\nrequired that one can give a constructive argument for transfinite\ninduction up to \\(\\alpha_T\\). As mentioned above, this was done for by\nGentzen and Takeuti for \\(\\varepsilon_0\\), the proof theoretic ordinal\nof \\(\\PA\\), but becomes more difficult and of progressively\nquestionable philosophical significance for stronger theories. See the\nentry on\n proof theory\n for a survey of Gentzen\u2019s consistency proof,\n Mancosu et al. 2021\n for an accessible textbook presentation, and\n Thomas-Bolduc and Darnell 2022\n on Takeuti\u2019s well-ordering proof.\n\nA philosophically more satisfactory continuation of Hilbert\u2019s\nProgram in proof theoretic terms has been suggested by Kreisel\n (1983;\n 1968) and Feferman\n (Feferman, 1988;\n Feferman, 1993a). This work proceeds from \na wider conception of\nHilbert\u2019s Program as an attempt to justify ideal mathematics by\nrestricted means. In this conception, the aim of Hilbert\u2019s proof\ntheory was to show that, at least as far as a certain class of real\npropositions is concerned, ideal mathematics does not go beyond real\nmathematics. A finitary consistency proof of the kind envisaged by\nHilbert would have accomplished this: if ideal mathematics proves a\nreal proposition, then this proposition is already provable by real\n(i.e., finitary) methods. In a sense this reduces ideal\nmathematics to real mathematics. A proof-theoretic reduction\nof a theory \\(T\\) to a theory \\(S\\) shows that, as far as a certain\nclass of propositions is concerned, if \\(T\\) proves a proposition,\nthen \\(S\\) proves it too, and the proof of this fact is itself\nfinitary. Hilbert\u2019s proof theoretic program can then be seen to\nbe a search for a proof theoretic reduction of all of mathematics to\nfinitary mathematics; in a relativized program one looks for\nreductions of theories weaker than all of classical mathematics to\ntheories often stronger than finitary mathematics. Proof theorists\nhave obtained a number of such results, including reductions of\ntheories which on their face require a significant amount of ideal\nmathematics for their justification (e.g., subsystems of analysis) to\nfinitary systems.\n (Feferman, 1993b)\n has used such results in combination with other results that show\nthat most, if not all, of scientifically applicable mathematics can be\ncarried out in systems for which such reductions are available to\nargue against the\n indispensability argument\n in the philosophy of mathematics. The philosophical significance of\nsuch proof theoretic reductions is currently the subject of debate\n (Hofweber, 2000;\n Feferman, 2000).\n\nThe program of so-called reverse mathematics developed by, in\nparticular, Friedman and Simpson, is another continuation of\nHilbert\u2019s program. In the face of G\u00f6del\u2019s results\nshowing that not all of classical mathematics can be reduced to the\nfinitary, they seek to answer the question: how much of classical\nmathematics can be so reduced? Reverse mathematics seeks to give a\nprecise answer to this question by investigating which theorems of\nclassical mathematics are provable in weak subsystems of analysis\nwhich are reducible to finitary mathematics (in the sense discussed in\nthe preceding paragraph). A typical result is that the Hahn-Banach\ntheorem of functional analysis is provable in a theory known as\n\\(WKL_0\\) (for \u201cweak K\u00f6nig lemma\u201d); \\(WKL_0\\) is\nconservative over \\(\\PRA\\) for \\(\\Pi^{0}_2\\) sentences (i.e.,\nsentences of the form \\(\\forall x\\exists yA(x, y)\\). (See\n Simpson 1988\n for an overview and\n Simpson 1999\n for a technical treatment.)\n",
