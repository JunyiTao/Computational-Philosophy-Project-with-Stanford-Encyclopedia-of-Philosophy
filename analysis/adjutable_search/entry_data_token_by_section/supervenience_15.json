But in some cases we\nmight be interested in a notion according to which things that are\nvery much alike in B-respects must also be very much alike in\nA-respects. This is similarity-based supervenience (Kim\n1987). (The remainder of this section closely paraphrases McLaughlin\n1995).\n\nWeak and strong versions of similarity-based supervenience can be\ndefined in the expected fashion:\n\nA weakly supervenessim on B if and only\nif for any world w, and for any x and y in\nw, if x and y are not largely different\nwith respect to B-properties, then they are not largely\ndifferent with respect to A-properties.\n\n\nA strongly supervenessim on B if and only\nif for any worlds w1 and w2,\nand for any x in w1 and y in\nw2, if x in w1 is not\nlargely different from y in w2 with\nrespect to B-properties, then x in\nw1 is not largely different from y in\nw2 with respect to A-properties.\n\n\nThese are versions of individual supervenience; global versions can\nalso be formulated. Strong implies weak, but not conversely, except\nfor the special case of intrinsic properties. (The latter can be shown\nby slight modification of Moyer\u2019s argument mentioned in Section\n4.3.4.)\n\nSimilarity-based supervenience is logically independent of\nindiscernibility-based supervenience: neither implies the other.\nSimilarity-based supervenience fails to imply indiscernibility-based\nsupervenience. It may be that there can be A-differences\nwithout B-differences, but that there cannot be\nlarge A-differences without large\nB-differences. And indiscernibility-based supervenience\nlikewise fails to imply similarity-based supervenience. The reason is\nthat there may be small B-differences that are critical\npoints for big A-differences. When that happens,\nsimilarity-based supervenience will fail, even though\nindiscernibility-based supervenience may hold. For example, it might\nwell be the case that small physical differences can be accompanied by\nlarge mental and moral differences. Similarly, a small physical\ndifference like a misplaced brush stroke might have a large effect on\nthe aesthetic value of a painting. Suffice it to note that it remains\nan open question whether there are any interesting philosophical uses\nof similarity-based supervenience.\n",
