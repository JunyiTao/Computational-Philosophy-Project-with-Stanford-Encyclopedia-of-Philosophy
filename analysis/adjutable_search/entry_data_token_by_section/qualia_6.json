If I have a red\nafter-image as a result of a flashbulb going off, the spot I\n\u2018see\u2019 in front of the photographer\u2019s face looks red,\neven though there is no such spot. If I live in a world in which all\nand only things that are purple are poisonous, it is still the case\nthat an object that looks purple to me does not thereby look poisonous\n(in the phenomenal sense of \u2018looks\u2019). If I feel a pain in\na leg, I need not even have a leg. My pain might be a pain in a\nphantom limb. Facts such as these have been taken to provide further\nsupport for the contention that some sort of representational account\nis appropriate for qualia. \n\nIf qualia are not qualities of experiences, as some philosophers\nmaintain on the basis of an appeal to introspection, and the only\nqualities revealed in introspection are qualities represented by\nexperiences (qualities that, in the perceptual case, if they belong to\nanything, belong to external things), a natural representational\nproposal is that qualia are really representational contents of\nexperiences into which the represented qualities enter. This would\nalso explain why we talk of experiences *having* qualia or *having* a\nphenomenal character. For the representational content of an\nexperience is something the experience has; just as meaning is\nsomething a word has. Moreover, just as the meaning of a word is not a\nquality the word possesses, so the phenomenal character of an\nexperience is not a quality the experience possesses.\n\nIf qualia are representational contents, just which contents are\nthese? Obviously there can be differences in the representational\ncontents of experiences without any phenomenal difference. If you and\nI see a telescope from the same viewing angle, for example, then even\nif I do not recognize it as a telescope and you do (so that our\nexperiences differ representationally at this level), the way the\ntelescope looks to both of us is likely pretty much the same (in the\nphenomenal sense of \u2018looks\u2019). Likewise, if a child is\nviewing the same item from the same vantage point, her experience will\nlikely be pretty similar to yours and mine too. Phenomenally, our\nexperiences are all very much alike, notwithstanding certain\nhigher-level representational differences. This, according to some\nrepresentationalists, is because we all have experiences that\nrepresent to us the same 3-D surfaces, edges, colors, and\nsurface-shapes plus a myriad of other surface details.\n\nThe representation we share here has a content much like that of the 2\n1/2-D sketch posited by David Marr in his famous theory of vision\n(1982) to which further shape and color information has been appended\n(for details, see Tye 1995). This content is plausibly viewed as\nnonconceptual. It forms the output of the early, largely modular\nsensory processing and the input to one or another system of\nhigher-level cognitive processing. Representationalists sometimes\nclaim that it is here at this level of content that qualia are to be\nfound (see Dretske 1995, Tye 1995, 2000; for an opposing\nrepresentational view, see McDowell 1994).\n\nOne worry for this view is that if qualia are to be handled in terms\nof representational content, then there had better be a content that\nis shared by veridical visual experiences and their hallucinatory\ncounterparts. Disjunctivists have disputed the supposition that there\nis a common content (see, e.g., Hinton 1973, Martin 1997, Snowdon\n1990). Perhaps veridical experiences have only singular contents and\nhallucinatory experiences have gappy contents or no content at all\n(for an extended discussion of visual experience and content, see\nPautz 2010, Siegel 2011).\n\nAn alternative possibility is that qualia are properties represented\nby experiences. On this view, there need be no common content shared\nby veridical experiences and their hallucinatory counterparts. It\nsuffices that the same properties be represented. Of course, such a\nview requires that a further account be provided of what it is that\nmakes a property represented by an experience a quale.\n\nSome philosophers try to ground qualia in modes of representation\ndeployed by experiences within their representational contents. On one\nversion of this view, visual experiences not only represent the\nexternal world but also represent themselves (for a recent collection\nof essays elaboarating this view, see Kriegel and Williford 2006). For\nexample, my current visual experience of a red object not only\nrepresents the object as red (this is my focal awareness) but also\nrepresents itself as red (this is normally a kind of peripheral\nawareness I have of my experience). When I introspect, the experience\nalone provides me with awareness of itself \u2014 no higher order\nthought is necessary. What the experience is like for me is supposedly\nits redness, where this is a mode of representation my experience uses\nto represent real world redness.\n\nThis view is incompatible with the phenomenon of transparency (see\nsection 6) and it is very close to the classic qualiaphile view,\naccording to which when the subject introspects, she is aware of the\ntoken experience and its phenomenal properties. The new twist is that\nthis awareness uses the token experience itself and one of its\ncontents.\n\nRepresentationalists about qualia are often also externalists about\nrepresentational content (but not always \u2014 see, for example,\nChalmers 2004). On this view, what a given experience represents is\nmetaphysically determined at least, in part, by factors in the\nexternal environment. Thus, it is usually held, microphysical twins\ncan differ with respect to the representational contents of their\nexperiences. If these differences in content are of the right sort\nthen, according to the wide representationalist, microphysical twins\ncannot fail to differ with respect to the phenomenal\ncharacter of their experiences. What makes for a difference in\nrepresentational content in microphysical duplicates is some external\ndifference, some connection between the subjects and items in their\nrespective environments. The generic connection is sometimes called\n\u2018tracking\u2019, though there is no general agreement as to in\nwhat exactly tracking consists.\n\nOn wide representationalism, qualia (like meanings) ain\u2019t in the\nhead. The classic, Cartesian-based picture of experience and its\nrelation to the world is thus turned upside down. Qualia are not\nintrinsic qualities of inner ideas of which their subjects are\ndirectly aware, qualities that are necessarily shared by internal\nduplicates however different their environments may be. Rather, they\nare representational contents certain inner states possess, contents\nwhose nature is fixed at least in part by certain external relations\nbetween individuals and their environments (Byrne and Tye 2006; for an\nopposing but still representationalist view, see Pautz 2006).\n\nRepresentationalism, as presented so far, is an identity thesis with\nrespect to qualia: qualia are supposedly one and the same as certain\nrepresentational contents. Sometimes it is held instead that\nqualia are one and the same as certain representational\nproperties of experiences (or properties represented in\nexperiences); and sometimes it is is argued that these\nrepresentational properties are themselves irreducible (Siewert 1998).\nThere is also a weaker version of representationalism, according to\nwhich it is metaphysically necessary that experiences exactly alike\nwith respect to their representational contents are exactly alike with\nrespect to their qualia. Obviously, this supervenience thesis leaves\nopen the further question as to the essential nature of qualia.\n\nFor further discussion, see Section 3 of the entry on\n representational theory of consciousness.\n Objections to representationalism are covered in the next\nsection.\n",
