    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention in Aesthetics\n4.1 Attention in Aesthetics\n\nThe subject matter of aesthetics can be demarcated in various ways,\neach of which is somewhat controversial (see Lopes, 2014). A natural\nthought here is that aesthetics might be identified as the branch of\nphilosophy that is concerned with one particular sort of experience.\nIf this proposal is to be informative then it obviously needs to be\nsupplemented with some specification of which sort of experience that\nis. It is clear that this specification cannot be given via an\nextensional specification of the objects that are experienced: the\nsame wine might be experienced by the connoisseur and the thirsty man,\nwith only one of their experiences being aesthetic; the same painting\nmight be seen aesthetically by the art lover, and from a purely\nfinancial point of view by its dealer.\n\nOne response to this would be individuate experiences more finely than\ntheir objects, by instead identifying some particular set of\nproperties that are experienced as belonging to those objects\nin the aesthetic case (see the section on aesthetic objects in the\nentry on\n the concept of the aesthetic).\n An alternative response would be to consider not only the contents\nthat are experienced, but also the way in which the subject\nexperiences them, perhaps by identifying some particular\nattitude that characterises the subject in the aesthetic\ncase, or perhaps by identifying some mode of attention that that\nsubject instantiates (see the section on the aesthetic attitude in the\nentry on\n the concept of the aesthetic).\n\nAttempts to identify such an aesthetic mode of attention are\nwell-represented in the philosophical tradition. Kant\u2019s famous\nclaims about judgements of beauty having a first moment of\ndisinterested pleasure are usually read as a paradigm of the\nattitude-identifying approach (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology),\n but Jessica Williams has argued that Kant must also be operating with\na notion of aesthetic attention, as being a mode of attention\ninvolving a distinctive combination of imagination and understanding\n(Williams, 2021).\n\nSome such notion of attention also plays a central role in R.G.\nCollingwood\u2019s account of the way in which art (and, in\nparticular, literature) contributes positively to a society\u2019s\nculture. Collingwood describes attention as \u201cthe assertion of\nourselves as the owners of our feelings\u201d, and takes this\nself-assertion to be crucial in enabling us to exercise volition over\nthose feelings, so that \u201cTheir brute power over us is thus\nreplaced by our power over them\u201d (Collingwood, 1938, p. 222).\nCollingwood therefore takes the diminution of a society\u2019s\nartistic culture to make it vulnerable to emotive influences (while\nhimself suggesting that this might best read, not as a broad\nphilosophical claim, but as a point about Europe in the nineteen\nthirties).\n\nAttempts to demarcate the aesthetic via the identification of an\naesthetic attitude, or of an aesthetic mode of attention, have been\nattacked \u2014 for their details, and for their more general\norientation (most famously by George Dickie, in his 1964 paper). Those\nlines of attack have led to a widespread acceptance of the idea that\nthere is something wrongheaded about specifying necessary and\nsufficient conditions for qualifying as aesthetic via the\nidentification of some particular aesthetic attitude. Many\nphilosophers nonetheless retain the idea that there are informative\nthings that can be said, in the service of less strictly defined\ntheoretical ends, about the sorts of attitudes that are often found to\nbe exemplified in aesthetic cases. It is in this spirit that some\nideas about distinctive forms of aesthetic attention have recently\nbeen revived.\n\nServaas van der Berg suggests that a distinctive mode of attention can\nbe seen in cases of aesthetic appreciation (van der Berg, 2019). He\nclaims that this mode of attention is distinguished by its\nmotivational structure, which has a form that is similar to the\nmotivational structure of game playing, as theorised by Bernard Suits\n(Suits, 1978) and Thi Nguyen (Nguyen, 2020). This structure is one\nthat inverts the normal order of priorities between means and ends: in\nnormal actions one\u2019s means are typically taken in order to bring\nabout one\u2019s ends, but the game-playing golfer (for example)\ninstead adopts the end of getting his ball into a hole in order that\nhe can take the means to reaching that end. Van der Berg argues that a\nsimilar inversion is seen in aesthetic appreciation, where the\ncognitive means that are required in order to reach understanding\nprovide the reasons for adopting the end of understanding an item that\nis being appreciated aesthetically.\n\nBence Nanay has set out a position with similar aims \u2014 not\naspiring to give necessary or sufficient conditions for the aesthetic,\nbut aiming to cast some light on the way in which certain central\ncases of aesthetic experience operate. He does this by giving a theory\nof the distinctive way in which our attention is engaged in the course\nof these experiences. Nanay emphasizes the psychological distinction\nbetween focused and distributed attention, and uses examples from a\nrange of arts to suggest that aesthetic experiences often require\nattention of both sorts.\u00a0 He also suggests this contributes to\nthe value that we place on such experiences (Nanay, 2015, 2016).\n",
