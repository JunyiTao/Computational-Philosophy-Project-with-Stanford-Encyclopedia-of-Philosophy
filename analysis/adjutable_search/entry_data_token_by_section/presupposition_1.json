    "main_text": "Characterizing Presupposition || Projection\n1.2 Projection\n\nThe hallmark of presuppositions, as well as the most thoroughly\nstudied presuppositional phenomenon, is projection\n(Langendoen and Savin, 1971). Consider (2). This has all the\npresuppositions in (3). These presuppositions all follow from\nutterances of the base sentence in (2), as do the regular entailments\nin (4): someone who sincerely uttered (2) would certainly be expected\nto accept the truth of (3) and (4), as well:\n\n(2)\nIt\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts.\n(3a)\nThere is a (salient and identifiable) knave.\n(3b)\nThere were (salient and identifiable) tarts.\n(3c)\nSomebody stole the tarts.\n(4a)\nThe knave did something illegal.\n(4b)\nThe knave took possession of the tarts.\n\n\nNow consider the sentences in (5):\n\n(5a)\nIt isn\u2019t the knave that stole the tarts. (negation)\n(5b)\nIf it\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts, he will be punished.\n(antecedent of a conditional)\n(5c)\nIs it the knave that stole the tarts? (question)\n(5d)\nMaybe/It is possible that it\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts.\n(possibility modal)\n(5e)\nPresumably/probably it\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts.\n(evidential modal, probability adverb)\n(5f)\nThe king thinks it\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts. (belief\noperator)\n\n\nIn all these examples, sentence (2) is embedded under various\noperators. What is notable is that whereas the statements in (4) do\nnot follow from any of these embeddings (and would not be expected to\nfollow according to classical logics), the presuppositions do follow.\nWe say that the presuppositions are projected. Certainly, the\ninference is more robust in some cases than in others: while it is\nhard to imagine sincerely uttering (5a) without believing some tarts\nto be salient, it is easier to imagine a circumstance in which (5f)\ncould be uttered when in fact the tarts were not stolen, but hidden.\nBut in the absence of special factors, to which we will turn shortly,\nsomeone who sincerely uttered any of the sentences in (5) might be\nexpected to believe all of the presuppositions in (3a)\u2013(3b).\n\nProjection from embeddings, especially negation, is standardly used as\na diagnostic for presupposition (hence the term \u201cnegation\ntest\u201d). However it is important to try several types of\nembedding when testing for presupposition for a few different reasons.\nFirst of all, it is not always clear how to apply a given embedding\ndiagnostic. For example, although it is widely agreed that the\nadditive particle \u201ctoo\u201d is a presupposition-inducing\nexpression, the negation test is awkward to apply because it is not\nimmediately clear whether the negation outscopes the additive or\nvice versa in (6b), and it\u2019s not obvious how the negation\ninteracts with focus:\n\n(6a)\nFred kissed BETTY, too.\n(6b)\nFred didn\u2019t kiss BETTY, too.\n\n\nWe leave it as an exercise for the reader to show that embedding (6a)\nunder a different operator e.g., under a modal or in the antecedent of\na conditional, provides evidence that this sentence presupposes that\nsomeone other than Betty was kissed by Fred.\n\nAdditionally, some inferences seem to project from negation but not\nother embeddings. For example, both (7a) and (7b) seem to presuppose\nthat the speaker has sensory experience with the pie, and this type of\ndata has led some to conjecture that uses of predicates of personal\ntaste are associated with a presupposition that the judgment of taste\nresulted from direct\n experience.[2]\n However, we don\u2019t get any projection of this inference from the\nconditional in (7c), and example (7d) seems to imply that the speaker\nhas not tasted the pie themselves. This data suggests that any account\nclaiming a presupposition of direct experience for predicates of\npersonal taste needs to be highly nuanced.\n\n(7a)\nThe pie is tasty.\n(7b)\nThe pie isn\u2019t tasty.\n(7c)\nIf the pie is tasty, it will go quickly.\n(7d)\nIs the pie tasty?\n\n\nMore generally, such examples demonstrate why it\u2019s important to look\nat a wide range of embeddings when identifying presuppositions on the\nbasis of their projection behavior.\n",
