Practical reason: morality and the primacy of pure practical reason\n\nThe first Critique only hints at the form of Kant\u2019s\nmoral theory would\n take.[18]\n The account of practical reason in the Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals (1785) and Critique of Practical\nReason (1788) is radically new. Kant now presents the supreme\nprinciple of practical reason\u2014the Categorical Imperative. It is\nan imperative: it represents a command for human beings, who\nhave needs and inclinations and are not perfectly rational. It is\ncategorical or unconditional: it must always guide our\naction.\n\nKant\u2019s first formulation of this principle runs as follows:\n\u201cact only according to that maxim through which you can at the\nsame time will that it become a universal law\u201d (4:421). (Kant\nalso gives other versions of this Imperative, which he sees as\nequivalent: see\n Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy,\n \u00a75\u2013\u00a79.) Kant argues that this principle\nis\u00a0implicit in common human reasoning. Although it requires much\nphilosophical effort to articulate this principle, we rely on it\nwhenever we make moral judgments.\n\nAlongside the Categorical Imperative, Kant also mentions the principle\nof \u201chypothetical imperatives.\u201d As he puts it,\n\u201cWhoever wills the end also wills (in so far as reason has\ndecisive influence on his actions) the indispensably necessary means\nto it that is in his control\u201d (4:417; cf.\n 5:19f[19]).\n Following Hume, many philosophers hold that practical reasoning is\nessentially instrumental. In this case, practical reason only gives\nconditional or \u201chypothetical\u201d instructions. These have an\n\u201cif\u2014then\u201d structure.\u00a0If someone has\nparticular ends or inclinations, then they should adopt\nsuitable means. (This is the idea of\n instrumental rationality;\n see also\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a74;\n Kant and Hume on morality,\n \u00a73.)\n\nIn Kant\u2019s view, this is just a matter of consistency. In his\nterms, the principle of hypothetical imperatives is\nanalytic\u2014to pursue an end is to employ\n\u201cthe indispensably necessary means\u201d (4:417; cf. Korsgaard\n1997, Newton 2017, Pollok 2017: Ch. 8). Someone who fails to take up\nnecessary means is not, in fact, pursuing that end. At best, they are\nhoping or wishing. At worst, they are involved in a practical\ncontradiction\u2014a sure sign of irrationality. However, they can\novercome this contradiction by abandoning the end. Seen as mere\nconsistency, rationality cannot require more.\n\nBy contrast, the categorical imperative is synthetic (4:420,\n447). It provides an end that every rational agent must\n adopt.[20]\n For Kant, the requirement to adopt universalizable maxims means that\nwe must respect all rational beings as\n\u201cends-in-themselves\u201d (4:428). For Kant, reason\u2014and\nonly reason\u2014is the source of this unconditional demand.\n",
