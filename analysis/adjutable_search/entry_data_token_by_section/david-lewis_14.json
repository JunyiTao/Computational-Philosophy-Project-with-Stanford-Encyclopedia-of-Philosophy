    "main_text": "Humean Supervenience || Laws and Chances\n5.1 Laws and Chances\n\nLewis\u2019s reductionist project starts with\n laws of nature.\n Building on some scattered remarks by Ramsey and Mill, Lewis proposed\na version of the \u2018best-system\u2019 theory of laws of nature.\nThere is no paper devoted to this view, but it is discussed in section\n3.3 of Counterfactuals, in \u201cNew Work For a Theory of\nUniversals\u201d, extensively in Postscript C to the reprint of\n\u201cA Subjectivist\u2019s Guide to Objective Chance\u201d in\n(1986b), and in \u201cHumean Supervenience Debugged\u201d\n(1994a).\n\nThe simple version of the theory is that the laws are the winners of a\n\u2018competition\u2019 among all collections of truths. Some truths\nare simple, e.g. the truth that this table is brown. Some truths are\nstrong; they tell us a lot about the world. For example, the\nconjunction of every truth in this Encyclopedia rules out a large\nchunk of modal space. Typically, these are exclusive categories;\nsimple truths are not strong, and strong truths are not simple. But\nthere are some exceptions. The truth that any two objects are\nattracted to one another, with a force proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them,\nis relatively simple, but also quite strong in that it tells us a lot\nabout the forces between many distinct objects. The laws, says Lewis,\nare these simple but strong truths.\n\nTwo qualifications are needed before we get to Lewis\u2019s 1973 view\nof laws. It is collections of truths, not individual truths, that are\nmeasured and compared for simplicity and strength. And it is not every\ntruth in the winning collection (or best system), but only the\ngeneralisations within it, that are laws. So even if the best system\nincludes particular facts about the Big Bang or its immediate\naftermath, e.g. that the early universe was a low entropy state, those\nfacts are not laws on Lewis\u2019s view.\n\nIn \u201cNew Work For a Theory of Universals\u201d, Lewis notes\nanother restriction that is needed. If we measure the simplicity of\nsome truths by the length of their statement in an arbitrarily chosen\nlanguage, then any truth at all can be made simple. Let Fx be\ntrue if and only if x is in a world where every truth in this\nEncyclopedia is true. Then Everything is F is simply\nstateable in a language containing F, and is presumably\nstrong. So Everything is F will be a law. But this kind of\nconstruction would clearly trivialise the theory of laws.\nLewis\u2019s solution is to say that we measure the simplicity of a\nclaim by how easily stateable it is in a language where all predicates\ndenote perfectly natural properties. He notes that this move\nrequires that the natural properties are specified prior to specifying\nthe laws, which means that we can\u2019t reductively specify\nnaturalness in terms of laws. (In any case, since Lewis holds that\nlaws are contingent (1986a: 91) but which properties are natural is\nnot contingent (1986a: 60n), this approach would not be open to\nLewis.)\n\nIn \u201cHumean Supervenience Debugged\u201d, Lewis notes how to\nextend this theory to indeterministic worlds. Some laws don\u2019t\nsay what will happen, but what will have a chance of happening. If the\nchances of events could be determined antecedently to the laws being\ndetermined, we could let facts about chances be treated more or less\nlike any other fact for the purposes of our \u2018competition\u2019.\nBut, as we\u2019ll see, Lewis doesn\u2019t think the prospects for\ndoing this are very promising. So instead he aims to reduce laws and\nchances simultaneously to distributions of properties.\n\nInstead of ranking collections of truths by two measures, strength and\nsimplicity, we will rank them by three, strength, simplicity and fit.\nA collection of truths that entails that what does happen has (at\nearlier times) a higher chance of happening has better fit than a\ncollection that entails that what happens had a lower chance of\nhappening. The laws are those generalisations in the collection of\ntruths that do the best by these three measures of strength,\nsimplicity and fit. The collection will entail various\n\u2018history-to-chance\u2019 conditionals. These are conditionals\nof the form If Ht then Pt(A) = x, where\nHt is a proposition about the history of the world\nto t, and Pt is the function from\npropositions to their chance at t. The chance of A\nat t in w is x if and only if there is some\nsuch conditional If Ht then Pt(A) = x,\nwhere Ht is the history of w to\nt.\n\nThe position that I\u2019ve sketched here is the position that Lewis\nsays that he originally was drawn towards in 1975, and that he\nendorsed in print in 1994. (The dates are from his own description of\nthe evolution of his views in (1994a).) But in between, in both\n(1980a) and Postscript C to its reprinting in (1986b), he rejected\nthis position because he thought it conflicted with a non-negotiable\nconceptual truth about chance. This truth was what he called the\n\u201cPrincipal Principle\u201d.\n\nThe Principal Principle says that a rational agent conforms their\ncredences to the chances. More precisely, it says the following is\ntrue. Assume we have a number x, proposition A, time\nt, rational agent whose evidence is entirely about times up\nto and including t, and a proposition E that (a) is\nabout times up to and including t and (b) entails that the\nchance of A at t is x. In any such case,\nthe agent\u2019s credence in A given E is\nx.\n\nAn agent who knows what happens after t need not be guided by\nchances at t. If I\u2019ve seen the coin land heads, that\nits chance of landing heads was 0.5 at some earlier time is no reason\nto have my credence in heads be 0.5. Conversely, if all I know is that\nthe chance is 0.5, that\u2019s no reason for my conditional credence\nin heads to be 0.5 conditional on anything at all. Conditional on it\nlanding heads, my credence in heads is 1, for instance. But given\nthese two restrictions, the Principal Principle seems like a good\nconstraint. Lewis calls evidence about times after t\n\u2018inadmissible\u2019, which lets us give a slightly more concise\nsummary of what the Principal Principle says. For agents with no\ninadmissible evidence, the rational credence in A,\nconditional on the chance of A being x, combined\nwith any admissible evidence, is x.\n\nThe problem Lewis faced in the 1980s papers is that the best systems\naccount of chance makes the Principal Principle either useless or\nfalse. Here is a somewhat stylised example. (I make no claims about\nthe physical plausibility of this setup; more plausible examples would\nbe more complicated, but would make much the same point.) Let\nt be some time before any particle has decayed. Let\nA be the proposition that every radioactive particle will\ndecay before it reaches its actual half-life. At t,\nA has a positive chance of occurring. Indeed, its chance is 1\nin 2n, where n is the number of\nradioactive particles in the world. (Assume, again for the sake of our\nstylised example, that n is finite.) But if A\noccurred, the best system of the world would be different from how it\nactually is. It would improve fit, for instance, to say that the\nchance of decay within the actual half-life would be 1. So someone who\nknows that the chance of A is 1 in 2n\nknows that A won\u2019t happen.\n\nLewis called A an \u2018undermining\u2019 future; it has a\nchance of happening, but if it happens the chances are different. The\nproblem with underminers is that they conflict with the Principal\nPrinciple. Someone who knows the chance of A should, by the\nPrincipal Principle, have credence 1 in 2n that\nA will happen. But given the chance of A, it is\npossible to deduce ~A, and hence have credence in A.\nThis looks like an inconsistency, so like any principle that implies a\ncontradiction, the Principal Principle must be false. The most obvious\nway out is to say that information about the chance of A is\ninadmissible, since it reveals something about the future, namely that\nA doesn\u2019t occur. But to say that chances are\ninadmissible is to make the Principal Principle useless. So given the\nbest systems theory of laws and chances, the Principal Principle is\neither false or useless. Since the Principal Principle is neither\nfalse nor useless, Lewis concluded in these 1980s papers that the best\nsystems theory of laws and chances was false.\n\nThe problem with this was that it wasn\u2019t clear what could\nreplace the best systems theory. Lewis floated two approaches in the\npostscripts to the reprinting of (1980a), one based on primitive\nchances, and the other based on history-to-chance conditionals being\nnecessary. But neither seemed metaphysically plausible, and although\neach was consistent with the Principal Principle, they made it either\nmysterious (in the first case) or implausible (in the second). A\nbetter response, as set out in \u201cHumean Supervenience\nDebugged\u201d, was to qualify the Principal Principle. Lewis said\nthat what was really true was the \u201cNew Principle\u201d. His\nproposal was based on ideas developed by Ned Hall (1994) and Michael\nThau (1994).\n\nWe\u2019ll explain the New Principle by starting with a special case\nof the old Principle. Let T be the \u2018theory of\nchance\u2019 for the world, the conjunction of all history-to-chance\nconditionals. And let H be the history of the world to\nt. Assuming T is admissible, the old Principal\nPrinciple says that the credence in A given H \u2227\nT should be the chance of A at t. The New\nPrinciple says that the credence in A given H \u2227\nT should be the chance of A given T at\nt. That is, where C is the agent\u2019s credence\nfunction, and P is the chance function, and the agent has no\ninadmissible evidence, it should be that C(A |\nH \u2227 T) = P(A | T).\nThis compares to the old principle, which held that\nC(A | H \u2227 T) =\nP(A).\n\nThat\u2019s the special case of the New Principle for an agent with\nno inadmissible evidence. The general case follows from this special\ncase. In general, assuming the agent has no inadmissible evidence, the\nrational credence in A given E is the expected\nvalue, given E, of the chance of A given H\n\u2227 T. That is, where C is the agent\u2019s\ncredence function, and P is the chance function, it should be\nthe sum across all possible combinations of H and T\nof C(H \u2227 T |\nE)P(A | H \u2227 T).\n\nThe New Principle is, Lewis argues, consistent with the best systems\ntheory of laws and chances. Lewis had originally thought that any\nspecification of chance had to be consistent with the Principal\nPrinciple. But in later works he argued that the New Principle was a\nclose enough approximation to the Principal Principle that a theory of\nchances consistent with it was close enough to our pre-theoretic\nnotion of chance to deserve the name. So he could, and did, happily\nendorse the best systems theory of laws and chance.\n",
