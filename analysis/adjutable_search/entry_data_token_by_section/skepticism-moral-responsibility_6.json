Chief among them have been findings in neuroscience that\nputatively indicate that unconscious brain activity causally initiates\naction prior to the conscious awareness of the intention to act (see,\ne.g., Libet et al. 1983; Libet 1985, 1999; Soon et al. 2008; Wegner\n2002) and recent findings in psychology and social psychology on\nautomaticity, situationism, and the adaptive\nunconscious (see, e.g., Bargh 1997, 2008; Bargh & Chartrand\n1999; Bargh & Ferguson 2000; T. Wilson 2002; Doris 2002).\n\nThe neuroscientific threat to moral responsibility originates with the\npioneering work of Benjamin Libet and his colleagues. In their\ngroundbreaking study on the neuroscience of movement, Libet et al.\n(1983) investigated the timing of brain processes and compared them to\nthe timing of conscious will in relation to self-initiated voluntary\nacts. They found that the conscious intention to move (which they\nlabeled W) came 200 milliseconds before the motor act, but\n350-400 milliseconds after readiness potential (RP)\u2014a\nramp-like buildup of electrical activity that occurs in the brain and\nprecedes actual movement. These findings lead Libet and others to\nconclude that the conscious intention or decision to move cannot be\nthe true cause of action because it comes too late in the\nneuropsychological sequence (see Libet 1985, 1999; Wegner 2002; Soon\net al. 2008; Pockett 2004; Obhi & Haggard 2004; Haggard &\nEimer 1999; Roediger, Goode, & Zaromb 2008). For some scientific\nskeptics, these and other findings (e.g., Soon et al. 2008) suggest\nthat the causal efficacy of the kind of willing required for free will\nand moral responsibility is an illusion (e.g., Wegner 2002).\n\nThere are, however, powerful objections to this interpretation of the\nneuroscientific findings. Some critics argue that there is no direct\nway to tell which conscious phenomena, if any, correspond to which\nneural events (Mele 2009). In particular, it is difficult to determine\nwhat the readiness potential corresponds to\u2014is it, for instance,\nan intention formation or decision, or is it merely\nan urge of some sort? Al Mele (2009), for instance, has\nforcefully argued that the readiness potential (RP) that precedes\naction by a half-second or more need not be construed as the\ncause of the action but rather is best interpreted as the\nbeginning of forming an intention to act. On this reading,\nconscious intentions can still be causes. Other critics have pointed\nto the \u201cimpossible demand\u201d of Libet-like experiments (N.\nLevy 2005), or the unusual nature of its experimental design (Nahmias\n2002, 2011), or to its irrelevance to moral responsibility (N. Levy\n2014a), or to alternative explanations that are less threatening\n(Rosenthal 2002; Dennett 2003). These objections have led many\ncontemporary philosophers (including many skeptics) to reject the\nneuroscientific argument for moral responsibility (see, e.g., Pereboom\n& Caruso forthcoming; N. Levy 2005, 2014a; Morris 2009). \n\nThere are, however, other scientific threats to moral responsibility\nbesides those posed by neuroscience. Recent work in psychology and\nsocial psychology on automaticity, situationism, and\nthe adaptive unconscious, for instance, has shown that the\ncauses that move us are often less transparent to ourselves than we\nmight assume\u2014diverging in many cases from the conscious reasons\nwe provide to explain and/or justify our actions (see, e.g., Nisbett\n& Wilson 1977; T. Wilson 2002; Doris 2002; Bargh 1997, 2008; Bargh\n& Chartrand 1999; Bargh & Ferguson 2000; Kahneman 2011). These\nfindings reveal just how wide open our internal psychological\nprocesses are to the influence of external stimuli and events in our\nimmediate environment, without knowledge or awareness of such\ninfluence. They also reveal the extent to which our decisions and\nbehaviors are driven by implicit biases (see, e.g., Uhlmann &\nCohen 2005; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz 1998; Nosek et al. 2007)\nand other unconscious System-1 processes (Kahneman 2011). No longer is\nit believed that only \u201clower level\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d\nprocesses can be carried out non-consciously. We now know that the\nhigher mental processes that have traditionally served as\nquintessential examples of \u2018free will\u2019\u2014such as\nevaluation and judgment, reasoning and problem solving, and\ninter-personal behavior\u2014can and often do occur in the absence of\nconscious choice and guidance (Bargh & Ferguson 2000; T. Wilson\n2002; Kahneman 2011).\n\nWhile these findings may not be enough on their own to establish\nglobal skepticism about moral responsibility, they represent a\npotential threat to our everyday folk understanding of ourselves as\nconscious, rational, responsible agents, since they indicate that the\nconscious mind exercises less control over our behavior than we have\ntraditionally assumed. Even some compatibilists now admit that because\nof these findings \u201cfree will is at best an occasional\nphenomenon\u201d (Baumeister 2008: 17; see also Nelkin 2005; Herdova\n2016). This is an important concession because it acknowledges that\nthe threat of shrinking agency (Nadelhoffer 2011) remains a\nserious one independent of the neuroscientific concerns discussed\nabove. The deflationary view of consciousness which emerges from these\nempirical findings, including the fact that we often lack transparent\nawareness of our true motivational states, is potentially agency\nundermining and could shrink the realm of morally responsible action\n(see N. Levy 2014a; Nadelhoffer 2011; King &\nCarruthers 2012; Sie & Wouters 2010, Brink 2013; Caruso 2015a; cf. Vargas 2013;\nK. Levy 2015; McKenna & Warmke forthcoming; Ciurria 2013; Mele\n& Shepherd 2013). A major point of disagreement, however, is over\nwhether consciousness is necessary for moral responsibility, and, if\nso, what role or function it must serve (cf. N. Levy 2014a; Shepherd 2012, 2015a,b,c; Searle 2000, 2001; Hodgson 2005, 2012; Sher 2009; Doris 2002, 2015; Nahmias 2002;\nSmith 2005, 2008; Sifferd 2016). \n\nLastly, independent of the two more specific concerns mentioned above,\nthere is also the more general insight, more threatening to\nagent-causal libertarianism than compatibilism, that as the brain\nsciences progress and we better understand the mechanisms that\nundergird human behavior, the more it becomes obvious that we lack\nwhat some have called \u201csoul control\u201d (see Clark 2013).\nNaturalists about the mind argue that there is no longer any reason to\nbelieve in a non-physical self which controls action and is liberated\nfrom the deterministic laws of nature; a little uncaused\ncauser capable of exercising counter-causal free will. While most\ncontemporary philosophers, including most compatibilists, have long\ngiven up on the idea of soul control, eliminating such thinking from\nour folk psychological attitudes may not be so easy and may come at a\ncost for some. There is some evidence, for example, that we are\n\u201cnatural born\u201d dualists (Bloom 2004) and that, at least in\nthe United States, a majority of adults continue to believe in a\nnon-physical soul that governs behavior (Demertzi et al. 2009;\nFahrenberg & Cheetham 2000; World Values Survey 1991\u20132004; Riekki et al. 2013). To whatever extent, then, such dualistic thinking is present in our folk psychological attitudes about free will and moral\nresponsibility (cf. Nadelhoffer 2014; Mele 2014), it is likely to come\nunder pressure and require some revision as the brain sciences advance\nand this information reaches the general public (see, e.g., Greene\n& Cohen 2004). Of course, how and in what direction this revision\nwill occur is an open empirical question\u2014e.g., some may adopt a\nrevisionism about free will and moral responsibility\n(\u00e0 la Vargas 2005b, 2009, 2007, 2012a) while other may opt for\na more eliminativist response (\u00e0 la Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Waller 1990, 2011; Strawson 1986; Caruso 2015b).\n\n[Note: While most anti-skeptical arguments focus on objections to the\nmanipulation argument, the luck objection, the Basic Argument, the\nLuck Pincer, etc., some recent anti-skeptical arguments have also\nfocused on the role of reference and alternative ways of thinking\nabout free will and moral responsibility. See, for example, the\narguments of Shaun Nichols (2013, 2015; Nichols et al. 2016) and \nOis\u00edn Deery (2015)\non reference and preservationism,\nKelly McCormick (2013, 2016) on anchoring reference in the context of\nresponsibility talk, and Manuel Vargas on preferring\nrevisionism to eliminativism (2005b, 2009, 2007,\n2012a).]\n",
