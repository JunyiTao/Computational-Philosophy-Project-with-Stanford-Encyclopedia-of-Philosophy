Hypothetico-deductivism\n\nThe central idea of hypothetico-deductive (HD) confirmation can be\nroughly described as \u201cdeduction-in-reverse\u201d: evidence is\nsaid to confirm a hypothesis in case the latter, while not entailed by\nthe former, is able to entail it, with the help of suitable auxiliary\nhypotheses and assumptions. The basic version (sometimes labelled\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d) of the HD notion of confirmation can be\nspelled out thus:\n\nHD-confirmation\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(h\\wedge k\\) is consistent:\n\n\n \\(e\\) HD-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash e\\) and \\(k \\not\\vDash e\\);\n\\(e\\) HD-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash \\neg e\\), and \\(k \\not\\vDash \\neg\ne\\);\n\\(e\\) is HD-neutral for hypothesis \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) otherwise.\n\n\n\nNote that clause (ii) above represents HD-disconfirmation as plain\nlogical inconsistency of the target hypothesis with the data (given\nthe auxiliaries) (see Hempel 1945, 98).\n",
