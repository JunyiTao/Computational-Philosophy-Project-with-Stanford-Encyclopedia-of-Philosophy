Condition\n(iii) \u2014 a similarly weakened version of the axiom of replacement \u2014\nmay be called the \u03940-replacement scheme. \n\n\nIt is quite easy to see that if A is a transitive set such\nthat <A, \u2208 | A> is a model of\nZFC, then A is admissible. More generally,\nthe result continues to hold when the power set axiom is omitted from\nZFC, so that both H(\u03c9) and\nH(\u03c91) are admissible. However, since the\nlatter is uncountable, the Barwise compactness theorem fails to apply\nto it.\n",
