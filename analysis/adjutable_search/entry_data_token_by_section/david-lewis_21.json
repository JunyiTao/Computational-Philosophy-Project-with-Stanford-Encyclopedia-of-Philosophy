    "main_text": "Other Writings\n7. Other Writings\n\nLewis wrote a lot that isn\u2019t covered by the broad categories\nwe\u2019ve discussed so far. The point of this section is to provide\na sample of that material. It isn\u2019t close to being\ncomprehensive. It doesn\u2019t include his treatment of\n qualia\n in (1988h) and (1995b). It doesn\u2019t include his contributions to\n causal decision theory\n in (1979e) and (1981b). It goes very quickly over his many papers in\nethics. And it skips his contributions to debates about non-classical\nlogics, such as (1982c) and (1990). We\u2019ve tried to restrict\nattention to those areas where Lewis\u2019s contributions were\ngroundbreaking, influential, and set out a new positive theory.\nShockingly, there is a lot to cover that meets those constraints, and\nis not included in the above survey of the major themes of his\nphilosophy.\n",
