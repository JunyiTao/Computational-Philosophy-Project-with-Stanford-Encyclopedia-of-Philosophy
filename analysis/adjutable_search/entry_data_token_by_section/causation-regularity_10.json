    "main_text": "Inferential Theories of Causation || Causal Model Approaches\n2.5 Causal Model Approaches\n\nIn his seminal book on causality, Pearl (2000) expounded a formal\nframework of causal models, which is centred on structural equations.\nA structural equation \n\n\\[v_i=f_i(pa_i, u_i),\\;\\; i=1, \\ldots, n\\]\n\n\ntells us that the values \\(pa_i\\) of certain parent variables\ndetermine the value \\(v_i\\) of a child variable according to a\nfunction \\(f_i\\) in the context of a valuation \\(u_i\\) of background\nvariables. At bottom, a causal model is a set of structural equations.\nEach equation stands for some causal law or mechanism. We can view\nthese equations as representing elementary causal dependencies. The\nnotion of a parent variable relies on causal graphs, which represent\nelementary causal relations by directed edges between nodes. Each node\nstands for a distinct variable of the causal model. Causal models have\nbeen used to study both deterministic and probabilistic causation.\n(For details, see the entry on\n causal models.)\n\nA distinctive feature of the semantics of structural equations is that\nit encodes some notion of asymmetric determination. The values of the\nparent variables determine the value of the child variable, but not\nthe other way around. Together with Halpern, Pearl devised several\ncounterfactual analyses of causation in the framework of causal\nmodels. These analyses incorporate elements of the inferential\napproach to causation. To be more precise, condition AC2(a) of the\noriginal and the updated Halpern-Pearl definition of actual causality\nis counterfactual, while AC2(b) is inferential. The latter condition\nrequires that a given effect must be a consequence of its cause for a\nrange of background conditions. (See Halpern (2016) for details.)\nNotably, the framework of causal models has also been used to develop\ninferential approaches to causation that work without a counterfactual\ncondition along the lines of Lewis (1973). We explain the basic\nconcepts of the accounts by Beckers and Vennekens (2018) and Bochman\n(2018).\n\nBeckers and Vennekens (2018) begin with explaining what it is for the\nvalue of a variable to determine the value of another\nvariable\u2014according to a structural equation\u2014in a context\n\\(L\\). This explanation gives us the notion of \\(C\\) being a direct\npossible contributing cause of \\(E\\). Such a direct possible\ncontributing cause is actual if \\(C\\), \\(E\\), and the context \\(L\\)\nare actual. For \\(C\\) to be an actual contributing cause of \\(E\\),\nthere must be a sequence \n\n\\[\\langle C, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, E\\rangle\\quad (n\\geq 1)\\]\n\n\nsuch that each element of the sequence is a direct actual contributing\ncause of its successor (if there is one). Finally, \\(C\\) is a cause of\n\\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) is an actual contributing cause of \\(E\\),\n(ii)\nthe causal path between \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) satisfies a specific\ntemporal constraint, while\n(iii)\nthere would be no such path if \\(\\neg C\\) were realized instead of\n\\(C\\).\n\n\nThe temporal constraint basically requires that the events of the\nsequence \\(\\langle C, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, E\\rangle\\) are temporally\nordered, i.e., no element in the sequence occurs later than its\nsuccessor.\n\nBeckers and Vennekens (2018) deliver rigorous solutions to a number of\ncausal problems, including overdetermination, early and late\npreemption, switches, and some scenarios of prevention. The account is\nnon-reductive since structural equations represent elementary causal\ndependencies. The framework of causal models does not give us a\nfurther analysis of such dependencies. The benefit of this strategy is\nthat the problem of spurious causal relations in common cause\nscenarios does not arise in the first place. The problem of singular\ncausal relations is not explicitly addressed, but it allows for a\ntrivial solution in the framework of causal models. We can build a\ncausal model with a structural equation saying that a collision of the\nEarth with a huge meteor leads to the extinction of dinosaurs. A\nnon-trivial solution is as challenging as in the other inferential\napproaches. It seems very difficult to cite all the different causal\nlaws and background conditions that causally determine dinosaurs to\ndie.\n\nThe analysis by Beckers and Vennekens (2018) is inferential in spirit,\nbut not explicitly inferential in the sense that they define a logical\ninference system with structural equations. Bochman (2018) goes a step\nfurther in this respect. His analysis is centred on what computer\nscientists call a production inference relation. This\ninference relation is characterized by certain metalogical axioms,\nsuch as Strengthening (of the antecedent), Weakening (of the\nconsequent), Cut, and Or. To get some understanding of a production\ninference relation, it suffices to know that it can be reduced to a\nset of rules \n\n\\[A_1 \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_k \\Rightarrow B_1 \\vee \\ldots \\vee B_n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_k\\) and \\(B_1, \\ldots, B_n\\) are propositional\nliterals, i.e., propositional atoms or negations thereof. Such a rule\nrepresents an elementary causal dependency in manner akin to a\nstructural equation. The symbol \\(\\Rightarrow\\) stands for some notion\nof asymmetric determination accordingly. Bochman (2018) shows how\nstructural equations using only binary variables may be translated\ninto a set of rules.\n\nIt seems as if we could now define \\(C\\) to be a cause of \\(E\\) iff we\ncan infer \\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in the context \\(K\\). But things are more\ncomplicated. The challenge is that the inferential path between \\(C\\)\nand \\(E\\) must also represent some active causal path, i.e., a\nsequence of events such that each event actually caused its successor\n(if there is one). In other words, we need some notion of an\ninferential path that corresponds to a causal path in the actual\nsetting of events. Once such a notion is established, Bochman defines\n\\(C\\) to be a cause of \\(E\\) iff (i) we can infer \\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in\nthe context \\(K\\), while (ii) we cannot infer \\(E\\) from the context\n\\(K\\) alone. The details of this inferential account are a bit\nintricate, and so we must refer the reader to Bochman (2018) to get a\nfull understanding. There, we can also find rigorous solutions to a\nnumber of causal problems, including overdetermination, early and late\npreemption, and some scenarios of prevention. It is worth noting,\nfinally, that Bochman presents his analysis as an inferential\nexplication of NESS conditions.\n",
