Some Recent Accounts of Structured Propositions\n\nHaving discussed structured proposition accounts in a general way, the\nbest way to further illuminate these accounts of propositions is to\ndiscuss some recent work on structured propositions. In so doing, we\nshall see various respects in which accounts of structured\npropositions can differ. Three caveats before proceeding. First, as\nwas mentioned above, structured proposition accounts, unlike possible\nworld accounts of propositions, allow for distinct necessarily\nequivalent propositions, and thus individuate propositions more finely\nthan possible worlds accounts. There are other accounts of\npropositions, or things that are intended to do the work of\npropositions, as in the previously mentioned example of Bealer [1993],\nthat are not structured proposition accounts (given the way that term\nis used here), but that allow for distinct necessarily equivalent\npropositions or things that are to do the work of propositions.\nAnother example is the interpreted logical form account defended by\nLarson and Ludlow [1993]. Though such accounts will not be discussed\nhere, the reader should be aware of them and that they are motivated\nby many of the considerations that motivate structured proposition\ntheorists. In particular, they attempt to individuate propositions (or\nthings that do the work of propositions) more finely than possible\nworlds accounts of propositions. Second, discussing a sampling of\nrecent work on the view that propositions are structured will not (and\nis not intended to) exhaust the versions of structured proposition\napproaches that there are. Rather, only some of the main issues and\ncurrent approaches will be highlighted. To that end, three broad\napproaches to structured propositions will be discussed; these are the\nNeo-Russellian Approach, the Structured Intensions Approach, and the\nAlgebraic Approach. In discussing each approach, a number of authors\nwho adopt the approach will be mentioned, but for definiteness, only a\nrepresentative of each approach will be highlighted in explaining it.\nThe reader should be aware that these groupings are somewhat loose,\nand that there may be important differences among authors who are\ngrouped together. Third, though questions will be raised here and\nthere, criticisms of the various approaches discussed will be left\naside. The task at hand is simply that of introducing the reader to\napproaches to structured propositions; criticizing the various\napproaches is a task for another day.\n",
