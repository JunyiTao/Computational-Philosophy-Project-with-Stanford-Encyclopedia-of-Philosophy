    "preamble": "\n\n\nPerfectionism has acquired a number of meanings in contemporary\nmoral and political philosophy. The term is used to refer to an\naccount of a good human life, an account of human well-being, a moral\ntheory, and an approach to politics. Historically, perfectionism\nis associated with ethical theories that characterize the human good in\nterms of the development of human nature. Writers as diverse as\nAristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Marx, and T.H. Green are perfectionists in\nthis sense.\n\n\nSpeaking generally, perfectionist writers advance an objective\naccount of the good and then develop an account of ethics and/or\npolitics that is informed by this account of the good. Different\nperfectionist writers propose different accounts of the good and arrive\nat different ethical and political conclusions. But all\nperfectionists defend an account of the good that is objective in the\nsense that it identifies states of affairs, activities, and/or\nrelationships as good in themselves and not good in virtue of the fact\nthat they are desired or enjoyed by human beings.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Perfectionism and Value Theory\n\n\nThe first thing to say is that an objective account of the good need\nnot make reference to the good of human beings. Some people think\nthat certain aspects of the natural world are valuable and would have\nvalue even if no human being existed. Others believe that great\nachievements in art and science have value beyond any effect that they\nhave on the lives of human beings. Perfectionist views that\naffirm judgments of this kind are examples of what can be called\nnonhumanistic perfectionism. Perfectionist accounts of\nthe human good, by contrast, are accounts that seek to identify the\ngoods that contribute to the value of a life for human beings.\n\n\nThe good life for human beings can be understood in at least two\nimportantly different ways. On the first understanding, such a life is\nconstrued in terms of well-being. The best life for a human being is a\nlife that goes maximally well for the person who leads it. On the\nsecond understanding, the good life for a human being is construed in\nterms of excellence or success. An excellent human life could be a\nlife that is best in terms of well-being, but it need not be, for it\nis possible that such a life requires a human being to make sacrifices\nin his own well-being for the sake of other persons or goods. Thus the\nnotion of an excellent human life is broader than that of a life high\nin well-being. And since it is the broader notion, a general\ncharacterization of perfectionism should employ it rather than\n well-being.[1]\n\n\nPerfectionism, so understood, contrasts with both hedonism and desire\nsatisfaction accounts of the human good. Let \u2018X\u2019\nrefer to an object, an activity or a relationship. Then, for the\nperfectionist, if X is good, then it is not good in virtue of\nthe fact that it is desired, or would be desired under appropriate\nconditions, by human beings. Likewise, for the perfectionist,\nif X is good, it does not follow that X must be a\npleasant mental state or causally related to one. Perfectionist\naccounts of the human good, of course, can allow that some goods are\nexperiential, but they reject the hedonistic thesis that all intrinsic\nhuman goods consist in pleasurable sensations or attitudes.\n1.1 Two Versions of Perfectionism\n\n\nPutting nonhumanistic perfectionism aside, perfectionist goods are\ncomponents of an excellent human life. Historically, as noted\nabove, perfectionists have related these goods to the development of\nhuman nature. For example, the development of rationality is\noften considered to be a perfectionist good because it is a capacity\nessential to human nature. Following Aristotle, a number of\ncontemporary writers have sought to develop accounts of the human good\nalong these lines (Hurka 1993, Foot 2003). We can use the term\nhuman nature perfectionism to refer generally to accounts of\nthe human good that relate perfectionist goods to the development of\nhuman nature. Other writers, however, have characterized\nperfectionism without any reference to human nature. John Rawls\ncharacterizes perfectionism as requiring the maximum \u201cachievement\nof human excellence in art, science and culture\u201d (Rawls 1971,\n325). Derek Parfit characterizes perfectionism in terms of the\nachievement or realization of \u201cthe best things in life\u201d\n(Parfit 1986, 162). Here it is the existence of the objective\ngoods, and not their relation to the development of human nature, that\nis highlighted. Similarly, other writers have identified\nperfectionism with the realization of a specified list of objective\ngoods (Finnis 1980, Griffin 1986, Arneson 2000). We can use the\nterm objective goods perfectionism to refer generally to\naccounts of the human good that identify perfectionist goods without\nrelating them to the development of human\n nature.[2]\n\n\nBoth types of perfectionism confront formidable challenges.\nProponents of human nature perfectionism must present an adequate\naccount of human nature. More precisely, they must give a plausible\naccount of the properties that are central to human nature and the\ndevelopment of which explain why certain activities and states are\ngood for human beings (Hurka 1993). Whether there is any account of\nhuman nature that both yields plausible results and has genuine\nexplanatory power can be doubted (Dorsey 2010). By contrast,\nproponents of objective goods perfectionism, having freed the\nidentification of objective goods from dependence on the development\nof human nature, must explain why some things, and not others, are\ncounted as good. Objective goods perfectionists need not formulate an\nexhaustive list of these goods. They may think such an undertaking to\nbe misguided. But they should have something to say about what makes\nan alleged good an objective good, one worthy of pursuit (Sumner 1996,\nSher 1997).\n1.2 Perfectionism and Pluralism\n\n\nThe distinction between human nature perfectionism and objective\ngoods perfectionism helps us approach an important question in value\ntheory. Must perfectionists be monists, holding that there is at\nbottom only one form of life that is best for all human beings; or can\nthey hold that there exists a plurality of equally good forms of life\nfor human beings? The question is important, since it is very\nplausible to think that the best life for one human being may differ\nfrom the best life for another.\n\n\nHuman nature perfectionism identifies the human good with the\ndevelopment of human nature. This looks like a monistic ideal,\none that identifies a single form of life as best for all human\nbeings. But, in fact, the ideal leaves many issues open.\nLet us stipulate that the best life for a human being is the life that\nmaximizes the development of his nature. Then, it still could be\ntrue that for different human beings different activities and pursuits\nwould best promote their good. This could be true, since\ndifferent people may be able to best develop different aspects of human\nnature. Given their temperament and talents, some do well to\nconcentrate on artistic pursuits, while others do well to focus on\ntheoretical studies or athletic achievements. Moreover, even\nthose who do well to focus on the same type of perfection, may find\nthat some activities and goals serve this end better for them than for\nothers. Finally, different tradeoffs between one\u2019s own\nperfection and the perfection of others may be rationally eligible and\nthis too will contribute to the plurality and variety of modes of life\nconsistent with the perfectionist ideal.\n\n\nThe compatibility of objective goods perfectionism and value pluralism\nalso can be established. One need only assume that some perfectionist\ngoods are either roughly equal or incomparable in value (Finnis 1980,\nRaz 1986). Friendship and understanding, for example, may both be\nperfectionist goods, but they may not be comparable in a way that\nallows us to rank lives that realize these goods to different\ndegrees. More generally, perfectionist goods may be combinable in\ndifferent proportions, yielding a range of different types of life\nthat are valuable and worthy of pursuit.  The adjective\n\u201cperfect\u201d when applied to a human life suggests one that\nis maximally good or excellent, but if goods conflict and are\nincomparable, or if combinations of goods are of equal or incomparable\nvalue, then a plurality of different types of life may have a title to\nthat designation\u2014or perhaps no life can be strictly perfect, but\nmany can be very good.\n\n\nNothing said here, of course, rules out the possibility that there\nreally is only one way of life that is maximally best for human\nbeings. The point pressed is merely that perfectionism is\nconsistent with value pluralism. Put otherwise, if objective\ngoods are plural and incomparable, as many recent writers maintain,\nthen this fact about the nature of value does not undercut the\nplausibility of perfectionism, of either the human nature or objective\ngoods variety. To be sure, a plausible perfectionism will\nrecognize that pluralism has its limits. Perfectionist value\ntheory seeks to identify goods and activities that human beings ought\nto preserve, promote and engage with. It implies that some ways\nof living are not valuable for human beings, even if they are fully\nembraced.\n2. Perfectionist Ethics\n\n\nPerfectionism as a moral theory directs human beings to protect and\npromote objectively good human lives. As such, it can take an egoistic\nor non-egoistic form. Egoistic forms of perfectionism are well\nrepresented in the history of moral philosophy. These theories direct\neach human being to perfect himself as much as possible, or at least\nto some threshold level. Egoistic forms of perfectionism need not be\nnarrowly self-interested. A number of perfectionist writers have held\nthat the good of others contributes substantially to one\u2019s own good\n(Green 1986; Hobhouse 1911). By promoting the good of others, one can\nthereby promote one\u2019s own good.  On such views, there is no deep\nconflict between one\u2019s own perfection and the perfection of\nothers. Non-egoistic forms of perfectionism, by contrast, allow for\nsuch conflicts. They hold that each human being has a non-derivative\nduty to perfect others as well as a duty to perfect himself. Such\nviews, at least in principle, can direct human beings to sacrifice\ntheir own perfection for the sake of\nothers.[3]\n\n\nWhether it takes an egoistic or non-egoistic form, perfectionism is\nbest understood as a moral theory that directs human beings to care\nabout the perfection of others as well as themselves. This claim is\nconsistent with recognizing, what is evidently true, that there are\nserious limits to our ability to bring about the perfection of others.\nThese limits explain why some philosophers, most notably Kant, have\nheld that we cannot have a duty to promote the perfection of others\n(Kant 1797). Many perfectionist goods require self-direction for their\nrealization. We cannot compel another to develop her capacities, at\nleast not all of them. Nor can we compel another to participate in\nvaluable social relationships. This valid point, however, should not be\noverstated. We can work to ensure that others live under conditions\nthat are conducive to their own self-development or their own\nrealization of perfectionist goods. Indirect promotion may be possible\nwhere direct promotion is not. The fact that human beings cannot\ndirectly bring about the perfection of others is nonetheless important.\nIt may explain why, in practice if not in principle, a plausible\nperfectionism would direct each human being to be more concerned with\nher own perfection than with the perfection of others.\n2.1 Consequentialism and Deontology\n\n\nThe best life for a human being might be one that simultaneously\nbest perfects himself and best perfects others. But this\npossibility is unlikely. Even if the conflict between one\u2019s\nown good and the good of others is not as sharp as it is often taken to\nbe, there will, in all likelihood, be circumstances in which human\nbeings must choose between their own perfection and the perfection of\nothers.\n\n\nHow then should this conflict be adjudicated within perfectionist\nethics? Egoistic forms of perfectionism have a ready answer to this\nquestion.  One should promote the perfection of others only to the\nextent that the perfection of others furthers one\u2019s own\nperfection. Non-egoistic forms, by contrast, must find a way to\nbalance the conflicting demands. One natural response to this problem\nis straightforwardly consequentialist. Perfectionism, it can be said,\nrequires that we pursue the greatest development of all human beings\nat all times (Hurka 1993, 55\u201360). So understood, perfectionism\ngives each human being a shared comprehensive goal.  This makes\nperfectionism a very demanding moral theory. It is demanding in two\nrespects. First, it demands, other things being the same, that we\nweigh the perfection of others equally with our own\nperfection. Second, it demands that, to the extent left open by the\nfirst demand, that we maximize our own perfection.\n\n\nPerhaps this kind of consequentialist perfectionism asks too much of\nus. We can imagine forms of perfectionism that relax both of its\ndemands.\n\n\nConsider, for example, a perfectionist moral theory that includes an\nagent-centered prerogative. Such a theory could allow that\npersons can favor their own perfection, to some reasonable degree, over\nthe perfection of others and that persons need only pursue their own\nperfection up to some threshold level. This relaxed perfectionism\nwould depart from the main historical defenses of perfectionism (which\nemphasize maximization) and it would not well fit the term\nperfectionism (which connotes maximization). But the important\nquestion is whether a view of this type is nonetheless plausible.\n\n\nThe answer depends, in part, on whether human nature or objective\ngoods perfectionism is the favored view. If perfection is\nunderstood in terms of the development of human nature, then a view\nthat departs from the maximizing injunction will look less\npromising. A person who has extraordinary potential for\nexcellence, but who only achieves a threshold level of development does\nnot plausibly achieve perfection. Since she was capable of so\nmuch more, we should not be content with her modest achievements.\nIntuitively, we should judge that she has not fully lived up to the\nrequirements of perfectionist morality (Hurka 1993, 56).\nMoreover, on this version of perfectionism, an agent\u2019s\nprimary moral goal is to develop human nature, not to lead a rewarding\nor fulfilling life. But if the development of human nature is the\ngoal, then it is a bit of a mystery why each human being\u2019s own\ndevelopment should have special value for himself (Hurka 1993,\n62\u201363).\n\n\nMatters look different if perfection is understood in terms of the\nrealization of objective goods. For, on this version of\nperfectionism, it is plausible to hold that each human being has an\nagent-relative interest in leading a successful life, where success is\nunderstood in terms of the pursuit of valuable goals and the\nrealization of perfectionist goods. A successful life, so\nunderstood, plausibly requires only a threshold realization of certain\nperfectionist goods, such as friendship, knowledge, and aesthetic\nexperience. For these reasons, a non-maximizing injunction fits\nbetter with objective goods perfectionism than with human nature\nperfectionism.\n\n\nWhatever its merits, the introduction of an agent-centered\nprerogative into perfectionist morality would exacerbate a problem with\nstandard consequentialist versions of perfectionism. It would\nappear to give human beings a moral liberty to harm others if doing so\nwould promote their own\n perfection.[4]\nTrue, the problem is present even without the\nintroduction of the agent-centered prerogative. A pure\nconsequentialist perfectionism in principle could enjoin the sacrifice\nof those who had little potential for perfectionist achievement for\nthose who had great potential. But such a view would at least\nhave the virtue that those who were sacrificed would be contributing to\nthe goal of maximum perfectionist achievement\u2014a goal they\nshould share if they are consequentialist perfectionists. The\nsame is not guaranteed to hold true if the prerogative is\nintroduced.\n\n\nSince the worry here is one that confronts consequentialist accounts\nof morality in general, it might be thought that perfectionist morality\nshould take a deontological structure instead. Deontological\nperfectionism would hold that the goal of promoting human perfection is\nconstrained by the requirement to respect the perfection, or the\ncapacity to achieve it, in each human being. The structure of\nsuch a view can be glimpsed by considering the objective goods version\nof perfectionism. For it is plausible that the achievement of\ncertain objective goods, such as friendship or community with others,\nrequires that we treat others with respect. Requirements of\nrespect, it can be said, are constitutively necessary conditions for\nthe realization of many perfectionist goods.\n\n\nThis is not the place to explore the structure of such a view in\ndetail. Nor is it the place to discuss the extent to which it\nrepresents a genuine departure from consequentialism (Pettit and Smith\n2004). Instead, another possible response to the worry can\nbe mentioned. As Rawls pointed out, perfectionism is often taken\nto be merely one element of a general moral theory (Rawls 1971,\n325). The moral duty to maximize human perfection must be balanced\nagainst other moral principles. Deontological constraints and\nagent-centered prerogatives might limit the duty to promote human\nperfection, but they might do so because they are derived from\nindependent moral principles. On this mixed view, in which\nperfectionism is understood as merely one element of a general moral\ntheory, it is possible to recommend perfectionism as an agent-neutral\nmaximizing doctrine and avoid the unwanted implications that morality\nis excessively demanding and that it endorses the sacrifice of some for\nthe sake of greater overall human perfection.\n2.2 Elitism and Inequality\n\n\nPerfectionist ethics has often been associated with elitist\ndoctrines. Whether it takes a consequentialist or deontological\nstructure, perfectionism is compatible with assigning different weights\nto the perfection of different human beings. And a number of\nimportant perfectionist writers have maintained that the perfection\nthat matters the most is the perfection of those who are capable of\nachieving the most. This \u201csuperman\u201d version of\nperfectionism, a view famously associated with Nietzsche, gives\nabsolute weight to the excellence achievable by certain great men, such\nas Socrates or Goethe and zero weight to the rest of humanity\n(Nietzsche 1873/1876; Griffin 1986, 60\u201361).\n\n\nThe superman version of perfectionism is an extreme view. It\nholds that some human lives count for much and many human lives count\nfor nothing. This view should not be confused with a different\nand less extreme view, one that can be termed the prioritarian\nversion of perfectionism. This view holds that we should\nvalue the perfection of each and every human being, but in aggregating\nhuman perfection we should count the greater perfections more than the lesser\n perfections.[5]\nHow much more?  On a simple version of the view, greater perfections\ncount for more than lesser perfections simply in virtue of being\ngreater.  A human life that achieves twice as much perfection as\nanother human life has twice as much value.  But it is possible that\ngreater perfections count for even more.  On a complex version of the\nview, greater perfections count for more than lesser perfections in\nvirtue of being greater and in virtue of an appropriate multiplier.\nMore precisely, on this version of the view, an equal unit increase of\nperfection counts for more the greater the perfection already\nattained.  Accordingly, a human life that achieved twice as much\nperfection as another human life would have more than twice its\nvalue.\n\n\nThe prioritarian version of perfectionism, on either the simple or\ncomplex version of the view, does not imply that the lives of those\nwho can achieve little count for nothing. It holds only that greater\nperfections\u2014a greater development of human nature or a greater\nrealization of objective goods\u2014 have greater value. It directs\nus to pursue the greatest overall human perfection, where this is\ndetermined by a weighted summing of the perfection of all human\nbeings.\n\n\nCompared with the superman version, the prioritarian version of\nperfectionism is significantly more plausible. It captures the\nthought that greater achievements are more valuable than lesser\nachievements without denying value to the latter. It recognizes\nthe claims of greatness without excluding all other achievements from\nmoral concern. Still, while not elitist, prioritarian\nperfectionism will likely have inegalitarian implications for the\ndistribution of resources. Thomas Nagel explains:\n\n\nA society should try to foster the creation and preservation of what\nis best, or as good as it possibly can be, and this is just as\nimportant as the widespread dissemination of what is merely good\nenough. Such an aim can be pursued only by recognizing and\nexploiting the natural inequalities between persons, encouraging\nspecialization and distinction of levels in education, and accepting\nthe variation in accomplishment which results. (Nagel 1991, 135)\n\n\nOne might object to these claims by holding that a sufficient amount\nof goods that are \u201cmerely good enough\u201d should be able to\noutweigh a small number of truly excellent goods. But if the excellent\ngoods are weighted more heavily, as recommended by the prioritarian\nversion of perfectionism, then in practice this possibility may be\nunlikely. (Much depends here on the strength of the prioritarian\nmultiplier.) Nagel appears to accept the prioritarian view, for he\nconcludes that \u201cno egalitarianism can be right which would permit\nhaute cuisine, haute couture, and exquisite houses to disappear just\nbecause not everyone can have them\u201d (Nagel 1991, 138).\n\n\nThe prioritarian version of perfectionism, then, may license\nsignificant inequality in the distribution of resources. The\ninegalitarian character of the view has some attractive consequences,\nhowever. When applied to population ethics, it has the potential to\navoid Parfit\u2019s \u201cRepugnant Conclusion\u201d. As Parfit\nexplains:\n\n\nWe might claim that, even if some change brings a great net benefit\nto those who are affected, it is a change for the worse if it involves\nthe loss of one of the best things in life (Parfit 1986, 163).\n\n\nThe focus here, as with Nagel\u2019s remarks, is on perfectionist goods\nrather than on the welfare of human beings. To avoid the repugnant\nconclusion, it must be claimed that these goods\u2014\u201cthe\nkinds of experience and activity which do most to make life most worth\nliving\u201d\u2014take absolute priority over less\nvaluable experiences and activities.\n\n\nThis claim, as Parfit allows, is vulnerable to counterexample. It is\nvery hard to believe that the best artistic experience is infinitely\nbetter than a slightly less good, but still excellent, artistic\nexperience. Viewing a Picasso might be better than viewing a Braque,\nbut not infinitely better. It is more plausible, then, to construe the\nprioritarian version of perfectionism as just assigning some finite\npositive multiplier to the greater perfections. But while such a view\nwould not be vulnerable to the kind of counterexample just adduced, it\nwould disable it from answering the Repugnant Conclusion (Hurka 1993,\n81\u201382).\n\n\nThe discussion so far has emphasized the perfectionist concern with\ncreating and preserving the best human experiences and activities. This\nconcern inclines perfectionism toward inequality. But it is possible to\ndefend an egalitarian version of the view; and the history of\nperfectionist ethics contains a number of such examples. Here four\npossibilities for developing an egalitarian version of perfectionism\nbriefly can be mentioned.\n\n\n(1) One can hold, as Spinoza did, that the most important\nperfectionist goods, such as understanding, are non-competitive. Their\nrealization by one human being does not impede, and may advance, their\nrealization in others. Maximum perfection, so understood, is compatible\nwith equality of material condition (Spinoza 1667).\n\n\n(2) One can hold, as some writers like T. H. Green did, that\ninequality in the distribution of resources impedes the perfection of\nall, the rich as well as the poor. Perfectionist values, on this view,\ncan be fully realized only in a society in which each member is roughly\nequal in power and status (Green 1986; Brink 2003, 77\u201388).\n\n\n(3) One can hold that the perfection of each human being matters\nequally and that the distribution of resources most likely to promote\nthe greatest overall human perfection is not one that contains great\ninequalities. Such a view would reject the prioritarian multiplier\ndiscussed above, holding instead that equal unit increases of\nperfection for those who achieve little count the same as equal unit\nincreases of perfection for those who achieve much; e.g., an increase\nfrom 9 to 10 has the same value as an increase from 99 to 100.\n\n\n(4) One can hold that perfectionism inclines toward inequality, but\nthat other non-perfectionist principles impose an egalitarian\nconstraint on the pursuit of perfectionist values.\n\n\nThese possibilities show that there is no tight connection between\nperfectionism and inequality. The degree to which perfectionism\nlicenses inequality will depend on answers to a number of difficult\nquestions, e.g. which version of perfectionism is best?, how great are\nthe natural differences between human beings?, to what extent are\nperfectionist goods competitive?, and what, if any, non-perfectionist\nmoral principles limit the pursuit of perfectionist values? The answers\nto these questions are very much in dispute within perfectionist\nmorality. Without firm answers to them, no one should reject\nperfectionist ethics out of hand because of a commitment to egalitarian\nvalues.\n2.3 Self-Regarding Duties\n\n\nHuman beings should care about their own perfection as well as the\nperfection of others. As we have seen, the standard of perfection\nis objective in the sense that it guides, or should guide, human\naction, even if it what it recommends is not desired. These\nclaims explain why perfectionism assigns an important place to\nself-regarding duties. A self-regarding duty to develop\none\u2019s talents, if there is such a duty, is categorical. One\nhas the duty whether or not one has a desire to fulfill it.\n\n\nThe possibility of self-regarding duties of this kind are sometimes\nrejected on conceptual grounds. Moral duties concern one\u2019s\ntreatment of others, and so a moral duty to oneself is a confused\nnotion. But this worry should not detain us for long. The\nkey point is that we can have categorical reasons to develop our nature\nor to engage in valuable, as opposed to worthless, activities. It\nis a secondary issue whether we should classify a self-regarding duty\nas a moral duty or as (merely) a categorical non-moral duty (Raz\n1994, 40). But while the worry should not detain us, it does point\nto an attractive feature of perfectionist ethics. Much\ncontemporary moral theory ignores duties to oneself, whether understood\nas moral duties or not, and focuses exclusively on our duties toward\nothers. Perfectionist ethics is an important corrective to this\ntendency. By expanding the domain of ethical concern, it has the\npotential to enrich contemporary moral philosophy (Hurka 1993, 5).\n\n\nDifferent perfectionist theories offer different accounts of the\ncontent of self-regarding duties. Generally speaking, it is\nuseful to distinguish negative from positive duties to oneself.\nNegative duties are duties to refrain from damaging or destroying\none\u2019s capacity to lead a good life. For example, barring\nexceptional circumstances, one has duties to refrain from suicide and\nself-mutilation. Positive duties, by contrast, are duties to\nexercise one\u2019s capacity to develop one\u2019s nature and/or to\nrealize perfectionist goods. For example, one has a duty to\ndevelop one\u2019s talents and not to devote one\u2019s life entirely\nto idleness and pleasure (Kant 1797).\n\n\nSpecific negative and positive self-regarding duties are derived\nfrom the more comprehensive duty to oneself to do what one can to lead\na good or excellent life. It is probably true, as Aristotle\npointed out, that the success of one\u2019s life depends on factors\noutside of one\u2019s control. If so, then no one can have a\nduty to lead a good life. Still, excluding the effects of luck,\nwe can say that each human being will have a more or less successful\nlife depending on the decisions they make and the options they\npursue. And we can add that each human being has a comprehensive\nduty to lead a successful life, to the extent that it is within his or\nher power to do so.\n\n\nStated at this level of abstraction, the perfectionist case for\naffirming self-regarding duties does not look particularly\ncontroversial. Resistance to it will likely derive from one\nof two quarters. Some will reject the very possibility of\ncategorical duties, whether to oneself or to others. Others will\naccept the possibility of categorical duties, but insist that they are\nlimited to the treatment of others. This latter view, on its\nface, looks unstable. It is likely motivated by the worry that if\nself-regarding duties are acknowledged, then the door is open for\npaternalistic interference. To address this concern, we must turn\nnow from perfectionist ethics to perfectionist politics.\n3. Perfectionism in Politics\n\n\nThe transition from perfectionist ethics to perfectionist politics\nis a natural one to make. Political institutions can be arranged,\nand state policies can be adopted, that promote or impede perfectionist\nvalues in various ways and to varying degrees. If one is\ncommitted to perfectionist ethics, then this commitment establishes a\npresumption in favor of perfectionism in politics. Other things\nbeing equal, one should favor political institutions and state policies\nthat do the best job of promoting the good in the context in which they\napply. Importantly, this natural presumption can be\ndefeated. For one thing, the political pursuit of perfectionist\nends might be self-defeating. This possibility is considered\nbelow. But it will be useful to begin by assuming that\nperfectionist state policies can be effective in achieving their\naims.\n\n\nCritics of perfectionist politics often reject the idea that there\nare objectively better and worse ways of living. Subjectivism or\nnihilism about the good often stands behind anti-perfectionist\ncommitments. But the most influential recent philosophical\ncriticisms of perfectionist politics do not stem from this\nquarter. Sophisticated critics of perfectionism grant, if only\nfor the sake of argument, the claims of perfectionist value\ntheory. They then seek to show that perfectionist state policies,\neven if informed by a sound understanding of the good, nonetheless\nwould be illegitimate. The character of perfectionist politics is\nbest appreciated by considering these arguments and their\nlimitations.\n3.1 The Principle of State Neutrality\n\n\nMany contemporary writers on politics reject perfectionism and hold\nthat the state should be neutral among rival understandings of the\ngood (Dworkin 1978; Ackerman 1980; Larmore 1987; Rawls 1993). The\nprinciple of state neutrality, as it can be called, articulates a\nprincipled constraint on permissible or legitimate state action.\nThe constraint can, and has been, formulated in different\n ways.[6]\nThree formulations of the\nconstraint have attracted support of late, and can be mentioned\nbriefly\n here.[7]\n\nThe state should not promote the good, either coercively\nor non-coercively, unless those who are subject to the state\u2019s\nauthority consent to its doing so.\nThe state should not aim to promote the good unless there\nis a societal consensus in support of its doing so.\nThe state should not justify what it does by appealing to\nconceptions of the good that are subject to reasonable\ndisagreement.\n\n\n\nAs these formulations bring out, the idea of state neutrality has\nbeen understood broadly in recent political\n philosophy.[8]\nA natural interpretation of the principle\nwould allow the state to promote the good, so long as it did so in an\neven-handed manner. But most proponents of state neutrality wish\nto keep the state out of the business of promoting the good altogether,\nat least if the good to be promoted is controversial or subject to\nreasonable\n disagreement.[9]\n\n\nA perfectionist approach to politics rejects the principle of state\nneutrality on all these formulations. For perfectionists, there\nis no general principle in political morality that forbids the state\nfrom directly promoting the good, even when the good is subject to\ndisagreement. It will be helpful to spell out in a\nlittle more detail the implications of this rejection of state\nneutrality.\n\n\nThe first formulation presented above follows from a consent-based\naccount of political legitimacy. Contemporary Lockeans do not reject\nstate action the promotes the good, so long as the state action in\nquestion enjoys the consent of the governed (Simmons 2005).\nPerfectionist political theory rejects consent theory and so rejects\nthis formulation of the neutrality constraint. The second formulation\nappeals to societal consensus, rather than actual consent. It holds\nthat in large pluralistic societies, the state should not aim to\npromote the good, since what is considered good often will be subject\nto controversy. This formulation of the constraint is not\nextensionally equivalent to the first one, since there can be a\nsocietal consensus that an institution or practice is good and ought\nto be supported by the state even when there is not universal\nagreement on the matter.\n\n\nThe second formulation is vulnerable to the following objection.  A\nstate might intentionally promote a particular religion, adherence to\nwhich was backed by a firm societal consensus.  This state does not\nlook to be a neutral state. The second formulation confronts another\nproblem.  It targets the aims of state officials.  But these aims are\nnot always open to view, and state officials may have a variety of\nmotives in mind when they make political decisions.  For this reason,\nsome have thought that it is more promising to apply the neutrality\nconstraint not to the aims of state officials, but rather to the\njustifications they give in public for the decisions they make. This\nyields the third formulation of the neutrality constraint. Defenders\nof state neutrality often defend the doctrine by appealing to the\nideal of public reason. Public reasons, they argue, must be shareable\nin a way that excludes appeal to controversial ideals of the\ngood. Thus state neutrality and public justification in politics\nemerge as different sides of the same\ncoin.[10]\n\n\nRecently, some proponents of state neutrality have argued that the\nthird formulation of the constraint is insufficiently demanding.\nState action may have an adequate neutral justification and yet remain\nnon-neutral.  For example, if state action that was designed to\npromote a particular religion were justified on the grounds that doing\nso were an effective means to serve some neutral end, such as civil\npeace, then the action would remain non-neutral, even if otherwise\njustified (Patten 2012, Kramer 2017). In response, proponents of state\nneutrality can propose a fourth formulation of the constraint, one\nthat combines elements from the second and third formulations.\n\nThe state should not justify what it does by appealing to\nconceptions of the good that are subject to reasonable disagreement.\nNor should it promote neutral ends by aiming to promote some\npermissible conceptions of the good over others.\n\n\n\nThis formulation of state neutrality applies to both the means and ends \nof state action.[11]\n\n\nFormulations of the neutrality constraint, such as the ones distinguished here,\nfigure in recent influential versions of social contract theory, most\nnotably that of Rawls and his followers (Nagel 1991; Rawls 1993; Barry\n1995). These views represent the chief contemporary rival to\nperfectionist political theory. In developing an account of\npolitical morality, these modern day contractualists instruct us to\nbracket our full understanding of the human good. Only by so\ndoing, is it possible to present an account of political morality that\nhas a hope of securing the allegiance of citizens who hold very\ndifferent conceptions of the good.\n\n\nThe plausibility of the principle of state neutrality remains very\nmuch in dispute in contemporary political philosophy. Proponents\nof the principle maintain that state neutrality is necessary if the\nstate is to respond appropriately to the fact that reasonable citizens\nin modern democratic societies are committed to conflicting conceptions\nof the good. They also hold that state neutrality is vital to\nensuring stable and mutually beneficial social cooperation in these\nsocieties. Those sympathetic to perfectionist politics\ncounter: (1) That support for valuable forms of life requires\npolitical action and that strict adherence to the principle of state\nneutrality \u201cwould undermine the chances of survival of many\ncherished aspects of our culture;\u201d (Raz 1986, 162) (2) That\nit is possible to reject state neutrality and embrace value pluralism\nand hold that there are a plurality of good, but incompatible, forms of\nlife fully worthy of respect (Raz 1986); (3) That proponents of state\nneutrality overvalue the goods associated with agreement and undervalue\nother goods (Wall 1998); and (4) That state neutrality is neither\nnecessary or sufficient for stable social cooperation and for\npreventing the abuse of state power (Sher 1997).\n\n\nMuch of the debate over state neutrality assumes that there is a\nstrict incompatibility between state neutrality and perfectionist\npolitics. But, in reality, the relationship between the two is\nmore complex. While perfectionists reject the principle of state\nneutrality on its common formulations, they need not reject it on all\npossible formulations of the principle. To explain: some\nperfectionists, as just noted, embrace value pluralism and hold that\nthere are a plurality of good, but incompatible, forms of life fully\nworthy of respect. These perfectionists can claim further that\nthe truth of value pluralism explains how fully reasonable people can\nadopt and pursue different ideals of the good. With this idea in\nmind, they could propose the following restricted principle of state\nneutrality.\n\n\nRNP: If two or more ideals of the good are eligible for those\nwho live in a particular political society, and if these ideals have\nadherents in that political society, and if these ideals cannot be\nranked by reason as better or worse than one another, then the state,\nto the extent that it aims to promote the good in this political\nsociety, should be neutral between these ideals in its support of them.\n(Wall 2010)\n\n\nRNP restricts the scope of state neutrality to ideals of the good\nthat are fully reasonable. Whether or not it is a sound principle\nof political morality, it is a principle that both responds to the fact\nof reasonable pluralism and is available to the political\nperfectionist. Since RNP does not rule out state action that\npromotes reasonable over unreasonable conceptions of the good, a\nproponent of this principle can accept it while affirming the\nperfectionist claim that \u201ccertain conceptions of the good are\nworthless and demeaning, and that political action may and should be\ntaken to eradicate or at least curtail them\u201d (Raz 1986:\n133).\n3.2 Respecting Persons\n\n\nStill, the principle of state neutrality, on its common\nformulations, remains an anti-perfectionist principle\u2014one with\nwide, if not completely unrestricted, scope. Its proponents\nseldom present it as a foundational normative commitment,\nhowever. As mentioned above, state neutrality is often defended\nas an appropriate response to the fact that reasonable people in modern\nsocieties disagree in good faith over the nature of the good and/or the\ngood life for human beings. But how exactly would state\nneutrality constitute an appropriate response to this purported\nfact?\n\n\nA popular answer appeals to a moral norm of respect for persons,\nwhere persons are understood as rational agents. The distinctive\nfeature of persons is \u201cthat they are beings capable of thinking\nand acting on the basis of reasons\u201d (Larmore 1996,\n137). To respect another person one must engage his capacity to\nrespond to reasons. In politics to respect another person is\n\u201cto insist that coercive or political principles be as\njustifiable to that person as they are to us\u201d (Larmore 1990,\n137). The mutual justification of political principles, it is then\nargued, is possible only if all citizens bracket their controversial\nviews about the good and seek to argue from common ground. Note\nthat this way of grounding state neutrality explains why the principle,\non its second and third formulations, does not rule out state promotion\nof shared or uncontroversial conceptions of the good. Since a\nshared conception of the good could figure in common ground\njustifications for political principles, its promotion need not express\ndisrespect to any citizen. State neutrality thus applies only to\ndisputed conceptions of the good.\n\n\nSuppose now that a modern state favors a disputed ideal of the\ngood. We need to explain why this action would be disrespectful\nto some of its citizens. The state might favor an unworthy ideal;\nbut if so, then its action would not be justified on perfectionist\ngrounds. So we must assume that it favors a sound ideal. On\nthis assumption, how would its action express disrespect to those whose\nviews were disfavored? Proponents of state neutrality point out\nthat people can have mistaken views, even while being appropriately\nreasonable. (This possibility is often explained by reference to\nwhat Rawls termed \u201cthe burdens of judgment.\u201d) They\nthen insist that if someone is appropriately reasonable, then his views\nabout the good should not be denigrated by the\n state.[12]\n\n\nThis argument immediately invites two questions. First, what\nis the connection between respecting a person\u2019s appropriately\nreasonable views about the good and respecting her? Second, how\nshould we construe the phrase appropriately reasonable\u2014that is,\nhow reasonable is appropriately reasonable? The first question is\npressing, since the argument, as it stands, appears to confuse respect\nfor persons with respect for the views that they currently endorse.\nPeople, after all, are not stuck with the conception of the good\nthat they affirm. As rational agents, they can revise their views\nin response to evidence, argument and reflection (Raz\n1998). If this is correct, then, so long as the state respects\ntheir capacities as rational agents, it is unclear why it must also\nrespect their mistaken, albeit reasonably affirmed, views.\n\n\nProponents of state neutrality can respond that there is an intimate\nconnection between the views about the good that a person affirms after\nreasonable examination and his social identity. By disrespecting\nthe former, the state disrespects the latter. As one writer\nexplains:\n\nOf course it remains the case that respect is for persons, not for\ntheir doctrines. But these doctrines are so deeply a part of\npeople\u2019s search for the meaning of life that public governmental\ndenigration of those doctrines puts those people at a disadvantage,\nsuggesting that they are less worthy than other citizens, and, in\neffect, not treating them as fully equal ends in themselves. (Nussbaum\n2011, 22)\n\n\nIn considering these claims it is important to keep in mind that we\nare assuming that the state is favoring a sound ideal of the good over\na misguided or false ideal. If we assume further that persons\nwith mistaken views about the good are not rationally sealed off from\ntrue beliefs about the good, then we can hold that the state in\nfavoring the sound ideal is, among other things, attempting to engage\nthe rational powers of its citizens. This will be true, at least,\nif state officials justify their favoritism toward the ideal by\nappealing to the reasons that establish its soundness. By doing\nso, state officials arguably would show respect for all citizens\nunderstood as rational agents (Galston 1991, 109).\n\n\nWe have arrived at two contrasting understandings of the norm of\nrespect for persons. For lack of better terms, let us call them\nRespect (1) and Respect (2).\n\n\nRespect (1): Respect for persons, understood as rational\nagents, requires the state to respect the rational powers of its\ncitizens, including their capacities to examine and revise their\nconception of the good. It also requires the state to justify its\nsupport for sound or true conceptions of the good by presenting valid\nreasons to its citizens for doing what it is doing.\n\nRespect (2): Respect for persons, understood as rational\nagents, requires the state to respect the doctrines that its citizens\naffirm, including their conceptions of the good, whether sound or not,\nprovided that these doctrines are (i) the product of the appropriately\nreasonable exercise of their rational powers and (ii) bound up with\ntheir sense of identity.\n\n\n\nNaturally, if Respect (1) is the favored view, then an appeal to the\nnorm of respect for persons will not ground the principle of state\nneutrality, at least on its common formulations. By contrast, if\nRespect (2) is the favored view, then it may provide a good measure of\nsupport for the principle. The type and degree of support that it\nprovides, however, will depend on how clauses (i) and (ii) get\nspecified.\n\n\nConsider clause (ii) first. It suggests that a person\u2019s\nbeliefs about the good can be bound up with her sense of\nidentity. We might call these identity-constituting\ncommitments. Other beliefs about the good may not be central\nto a person\u2019s identity, call them peripheral\ncommitments. The distinction is not sharp, and a commitment\nthat is peripheral for one person may be identity-constituting for\nanother. Still, while fluid, the distinction does seem to mark\nsomething important. Certain commitments are very tightly bound\nup with a person\u2019s sense of who he is, while others are\nnot. The present modest point is that, given Respect (2), respect\nfor persons requires the state to respond in the right way to its\ncitizens\u2019 identity constituting commitments. It does not\nspeak to the issue of how the state should respond to their peripheral\ncommitments. Thus an appeal to Respect (2) would not explain why\nstate action that favors disputed conceptions of the good that do not\nimpugn the identity-constituting commitments of any of its citizens\nwould be impermissible.\n\n\nNext consider clause (i), which is of greater importance and brings\nus to the question of how to construe the phrase \u201cappropriately\nreasonable\u201d in the statement of the respect for persons\nnorm. Respect for persons, on Respect (2), requires the state to\nrespect the conceptions of the good of its citizens provided that these\nconceptions are the products of the appropriately reasonable exercise\nof their rational powers. The standards of appropriate exercise\ncan be set high or low. Consider the\n following.[13]\n\n\n\nFully Reasonable: a conception of the good is appropriately reasonable\nso long as \u201cits adherents are stably disposed to affirm it as\nthey acquire new information and subject it to critical\nreflection\u201d (Cohen 2009, 52). Adherents of such a conception\napportion their beliefs to their evidence, are alert and attentive to\nnew evidence, and appropriately update their beliefs as new evidence\nbecomes available.\n\n\nModerately Reasonable: a conception of the good is appropriately\nreasonable so long as its adherents are stably disposed to affirm it,\ngiven the evidence that they have, and given that they satisfy minimal\nstandards of coherence and consistency. Adherents of such a conception\nupdate their beliefs as they become aware of new evidence.\n\n\nMinimally Reasonable: a conception of the good is appropriately\nreasonable so long as it is the product of a person\u2019s efforts to find\nmeaning or value in life. (Nussbaum 2011)\n\n\n\nThe first of these specifications is demanding, especially if the\nstandards of critical reflection are themselves demanding. Many\nconceptions of the good affirmed by people in modern societies will not\nqualify as appropriately reasonable under it. The second\nspecification lowers the standards, but it too is inconsistent with a\nrange of conceptions of the good that flout simple demands of\nconsistency and are not responsive to evidence, such as those oriented\naround astrology or New Age religions (Nussbaum 2011). If\neither of these specifications is factored into Respect (2), then the\nnorm of respect for persons will not rule out nonneutral state action\nthat favors some disputed conceptions of the good over other less\nreasonable conceptions.\n\n\nThe first two specifications, however, can do justice to the thought\nthat respect for persons is respect for their distinctive capacity to\nrespond to the reasons that apply to them. It is much less clear\nthat the third specification can do so. Since irrational and even\nsilly conceptions of the good can be the product of efforts to find\nmeaning or value in life, they are entitled to full respect under\nit. However, since these conceptions of the good are not the\nproduct of the exercise of rational capacities\u2014except in the\nvery minimal sense in which any belief is the product of such\ncapacities\u2014the third specification fits uncomfortably with the\nthought that respect for persons is respect for their rational capacity\nto respond to reasons. Yet this minimal specification of the\nstandards of reasonableness\u2014precisely because it is so\nundemanding\u2014can support a principle of state neutrality with\nwide scope.\n\n\nThere is a tension, then, between construals of Respect (2) that\ntake seriously the claim that the distinctive feature of persons is\ntheir capacity to respond to reasons and construals of Respect (2) that\ncan ground a principle of state neutrality that has the kind of wide\nscope associated with common understandings of the principle.\nThere may be no cogent construal of Respect (2) that both does justice\nto the thought that persons are owed respect in virtue of their\nrational capacities and grounds a principle of state neutrality with\nwide scope. Moreover, Respect (1) remains an eligible\ninterpretation of the norm of respect for persons and, as emphasized\nhere, it cannot ground a principle of state neutrality of the sort that\nproponents of the principle traditionally have wanted to defend.\n\n\nNo conclusions can be drawn in this entry concerning the best\ninterpretation of the norm of respect for persons. In light of\nthe foregoing discussion, two modest points can be registered.\nFirst, a simple and straightforward appeal to the norm of respect for\npersons cannot ground or justify the principle of state neutrality (on\nany of its common formulations), since this norm, like other normative\ncommitments, is subject to a range of interpretations, which are very\nmuch in dispute among moral and political philosophers.\nSecond, perfectionists and anti-perfectionists alike can\naccept that respect for persons is a factor relevant to assessing the\nlegitimacy of state action. Their disagreement over how this norm\nis best characterized is reflected in their disagreement over state\nneutrality.\n3.3  Self-Respect and Societal Excellence\n\nPutting respect for others aside, considerations of self-respect, and\nthe social conditions that support a secure sense of self-respect,\nhave been thought to bear on the advisability of perfectionist\npolitical action.  Most notably, Rawls claimed that a secure sense of\nself-respect, and the social conditions that support it, is a\nfundamental primary good, one that political institutions ought to\nsecure for those subject to them.  Self-respect, Rawls further\nclaimed, requires two elements: (i) a \u201csecure conviction that\n[one\u2019s] conception of [one\u2019s] good, [one\u2019s] plan of\nlife, is worth carrying out\u201d and (ii) \u201ca confidence in\none\u2019s ability, so far as it is within one\u2019s power, to\nfulfill one\u2019s intentions\u201d (Rawls 1971, 440).\n\nThe first of these elements \u2013 the conviction claim \u2013 may\ntell against state measures designed to promote some activities and\npursuits over others on the grounds that they are especially valuable\nor worthy of advancement.  For such state action could express the\nview that the disfavored pursuits are not equally worthwhile and this,\nin turn, could damage the self-respect of those whose conception of\nthe good is bound up with them.  Presumably, this is why Rawls held\nthat \u201cdemocracy in judging one another\u2019s aims is the\nfoundation of self-respect in a well-ordered society\u201d (Rawls\n1971,442).\n\nTwo perfectionist responses to this line of thought can be mentioned\nbriefly here.  First, state efforts to promote excellence can be\ndesigned to encourage a wide range of human achievements that can be\nappreciated by many who do not directly participate in them.  Further,\npeople\u2019s self-respect may be affected significantly by the\nexcellence realized by their society.  If so, then by promoting\nsocietal excellence, the state would further the self-respect of its\nmembers (Kramer 2017). These positive effects on self-respect of state\naction that promotes excellence would need to be balanced against any\nnegative effects of such action.  Second, self-respect, as\ncharacterized by Rawls, may not be the relevant good.  Rather, the\nrelevant good may be merited self-respect (Wall 2013b).  Put\notherwise, each person may have a genuine interest in living a life\nthat is valuable and worthwhile, not one that he merely has a secure\nconviction is valuable and worthwhile, whether or not it in fact is.\nOn this view of self-respect, perfectionist political action that\nfavors worthwhile pursuits over base pursuits can further the relevant\ngood by contributing to a social environment that nourishes it.  As\nthis second response brings out, concerns over self-respect engage\ndeeper questions in value theory that divide perfectionists from many\nof their critics.\n3.4 The Harm Principle\n\n\nThose who reject the principle of state neutrality entrust the state\nwith the task of promoting the good. This can give rise to the worry\nthat a perfectionist account of politics is insufficiently sensitive to\nthe harm of coercion and to the value of liberty. If the state need not\nbe neutral among rival understandings of the good, then is the door not\nopen for the coercive imposition of state policies designed to promote\nthe good? In fact, many versions of perfectionism drawn from the\nhistory of political thought have paid little heed to the value of\nindividual liberty. It is an important matter, then, to what extent\nperfectionist politics can be reconciled with a proper regard for\nindividual liberty.\n\n\nTo approach this issue, it will be helpful to consider the so called\nharm principle. The harm principle, as articulated by writers in the\nliberal political tradition from Mill to Feinberg, is often taken to\nbe an essential safeguard for individual freedom in political\nsociety. At least at first pass, the harm principle substantially\nrestricts the power of governments to promote the good. It holds that\ngovernments cannot coercively interfere with persons unless doing so\nis necessary to prevent them from causing clear and direct harm to\nothers. The harm principle requires interpretation and can be\nunderstood in different ways. But for present purposes our question is\nwhether the harm principle is best understood to be an\nanti-perfectionist principle\u2014a principle that provides reasons\nfor rejecting or limiting perfectionist politics.\n\n\nThe first thing to say is that not all perfectionist policies are\ncoercive. Governments can and do promote the good noncoercively. A\ngovernment may promote the good, for example, when it intelligently\nsubsidizes art. This perfectionist policy need involve no coercive\ninterference\n whatsoever.[14]\nSo the harm principle, even if sound, would\nnot bar all perfectionist policies. It would rule out only coercive\ngovernmental policies designed to favor some options and discourage\nothers. The question then is whether this restriction is itself\nanti-perfectionist.\n\n\nHere we need to proceed with caution. The extent to which\nperfectionism licenses the coercive promotion of the good depends,\namong other things, on the degree to which autonomy or liberty is\nitself recognized to be a perfectionist good. On some versions of\nperfectionism the harm principle would be an anti-perfectionist\nprinciple, while on others it would not be. Consider, in this\nregard, Mill\u2019s own defense of the harm principle. For Mill\n\u201cindividuality\u201d is an essential component of a good human\nlife. Mill\u2019s notion of individuality can be understood to be a\nconception of autonomy. A person is autonomous for Mill if he leads his\nlife on his own terms and develops his capacities and faculties\naccording to \u201chis own mode of laying out his existence\u201d\n(Mill 1859, 64). The important point for present purposes is not Mill\u2019s\nparticular characterization of autonomy, but rather the structure of\nhis view. Autonomy is understood to be an essential aspect of a good\nhuman life, not a separate norm. And the value of autonomy explains, at\nleast in part, why Mill recommends the harm principle.\n\n\nThe Millian defense of the harm principle sits well with the\nperfectionist focus on good human lives. (Brink 2013) Its availability nicely\nillustrates how perfectionist politics can be consistent with a strong\nrejection of state coercion. But it is natural to suspect that\nMill overstates his case. Even granting that\n\u201cindividuality\u201d is an aspect of a good human life, we\nshould wonder why it takes priority over all other aspects. If a\ngovernmental policy, say a policy that criminalizes the sale and use of\ndangerous recreational drugs, would prevent many from ruining their\nlives while infringing the individuality of only a few, then, contrary\nto Mill, the government may do better in discharging its duty to\npromote good human lives by adopting the policy than by not adopting\nit.\n\n\nThis point can be pushed further. Autonomy, it can be argued,\nrequires that one have access to an adequate range of valuable or\nworthwhile options (Raz 1986). This adequacy requirement does not imply\nthat every time an option is closed off one\u2019s autonomy will be set\nback. Moreover, what may be of value is not autonomous agency per se,\nbut valuable autonomous agency. Joseph Raz explains: \u201cSince our\nconcern for autonomy is a concern to enable people to have a good life\nit furnishes us with reason to secure that autonomy which could be\nvaluable. Providing, preserving or protecting bad options does not\nenable one to enjoy valuable autonomy\u201d (Raz 1986, 412). If\nvaluable autonomy, and not autonomy per se, is what has perfectionist\nvalue, then when governments eliminate, or make it more costly for\npersons to pursue, worthless options, then they may do no perfectionist\nharm and much perfectionist good.\n\n\nOn Raz\u2019s view, the harm principle is superseded by an autonomy\nprinciple that captures the truth in it while avoiding its\nexaggerations. The autonomy principle holds that the state has negative\nduties to respect the autonomy of its citizens as well as positive\nduties to promote and sustain social conditions that contribute to its\nrealization. The harm principle, to the extent that it is sound, is\nvindicated because it follows, given certain contingent facts, from the\nautonomy principle. This leads Raz to reformulate the harm principle as\na principle \u201cthat regards the prevention of harm to anyone\n(himself included) as the only justifiable ground for coercive\ninterference with a person\u201d (Raz 1986, 412\u201313). So construed, the\nharm principle would permit the coercive enforcement of at least some\nself-regarding duties.\n\n\nBoth Mill and Raz accept versions of the harm principle. But they\naccept it not as a limit on perfectionist politics, but rather as a\nprinciple that guides the proper promotion of the good. Their political\ntheories are examples of perfectionist liberalism and their discussions\nof the harm principle show how perfectionist politics can be supportive\nof individual liberty. It can be objected, however, that the defense of\nindividual liberty provided by perfectionist liberalism is\ninsufficient. Recall that on the perfectionist view discussed here\nautonomy is an aspect of a good human life. It is not a separate norm.\nA strong and uncompromising defense of the harm principle, it may be\nthought, must be based on a different understanding of the value of\nautonomy, one that holds that the autonomy of persons cannot be\ninfringed even when doing so is, all things considered, in their best\ninterests. Autonomy, on this view, is a sovereign right, not an ideal\nto be promoted (Feinberg 1989). The nature and plausibility of this\nalternative view of autonomy, however, are not matters that can be\ntaken up\n here.[15]\n3.5 Manipulation and Independence\n\n\nMost perfectionist writers accept that sometimes the state can\npermissibly use coercion to promote the good. Still, coercion is\nin general a clumsy device for pursuing perfectionist ends\n(Hurka 1993, 157). Noncoercive perfectionism, such as subsidizing\nvaluable pursuits, attaching penalties to worthless ones or creating\nnew valuable options, is often the better method for promoting\nthe\n good.[16]\nEven noncoercive\nperfectionist measures, however, may pose a threat to autonomy.\nAs one critic expresses the worry,\n\n\nMessing with the options that one faces, changing one\u2019s\npayoffs can be seen as manipulation \u2026 If it is done\nintentionally, it also takes on the insulting aspect of manipulation,\nfor it treats the agent as someone incapable of making independent\nmoral decisions on the merits of the case. (Waldron 1989,\n1145\u20131146)\n\n\nThe objection is that noncoercive state perfectionism is inherently\nmanipulative. It distorts the rational decision making of\ncitizens by altering the value of their options. It is also\ninsulting\u2014the state treats its subjects as if they were\nchildren\u2014and this is objectionable, over and above any impact\nit has on their autonomy.\n\n\nThese are important concerns. Before discussing them more\nfully, we need to clarify their character. The noncoercive\nperfectionist measures in question are paternalistic in the sense that\nthey are intended to help citizens lead better lives. Not every\nkind of noncoercive state perfectionism is paternalistic,\nhowever. Recall nonhumanistic versions of perfectionism.\nThose who accept these views might favor state support for excellence\nin science and art not because doing so will enable citizens to lead\nbetter lives, but because the state ought to promote excellence.\nThis defense of noncoercive state paternalism does not presume that\nsome citizens are not good at making independent moral decisions about\nhow to lead their lives. The manipulation objection to\nnoncoercive state perfectionism, accordingly, must target a subset of\nthese measures.\n\n\nFocus then on noncoercive state perfectionist measures that are\nintended to help citizens make better decisions about how to lead their\nlives. Even if these measures are well designed, they may invade\nautonomy. And if autonomy is itself a perfectionist good, then\nthere would be perfectionist reasons to oppose these perfectionist\nmeasures. These reasons would not establish that no such measures\nshould be undertaken. Presumably, the autonomy-based reasons\ncould be outweighed in some cases, but\u2014assuming again that\nautonomy is a perfectionist good\u2014these reasons would establish\nthat there is a pro tanto case against state perfectionism of\nthis kind.\n\n\nIs it true that noncoercive state perfectionism that aims to help\ncitizens make better choices is inherently manipulative in an\nautonomy-invading way? Perhaps not. No government\n\u201ccan avoid either nonrationally shaping its citizen\u2019s\npreferences or providing them with incentives\u201d (Sher 1997,\n66). This is true, since even if governments do not adopt\nperfectionist measures, the unintended consequences of state action\nwill have effects on citizen preferences for options and on the\nrelative costs of the different options that they confront. Thus\nit can be said that \u201cif all political arrangements do\nnonrationally shape preferences and provide incentives, a government\nwill not further diminish autonomy simply by producing these effects\nintentionally\u201d (Sher 1997, 67).\n\n\nThis line of argument can be extended further. Every political\nsociety provides its members with an ethical environment, an\nenvironment that consists of options and pressures, some rational and\nsome not, that affect how the options are perceived. A political\nsociety that does not engage in state perfectionism of any kind can be\nsaid to countenance the ethical environment that results from its\npolitical decisions. (It countenances this environment insofar as\nit could have made decisions that would have affected it, but chose not\nto do so.) It is possible that an ethical environment that\nresults from no state perfectionism will be ideal for the autonomous\ndecision making of its members. This may not always be the case,\nhowever. Noncoercive state perfectionist measures may be able to\ncounteract or cancel various pressures and influences that would\notherwise impede rational decision making by its citizens.\nDesigned well, such measures might contribute to an ethical environment\nin which people were best able to respond to the reasons for and\nagainst the options that they confront.\n\n\nThis argument puts the spotlight squarely on the effects of\nperfectionist measures. If these measures help citizens respond\nbetter to the reasons for and against the choices that they confront,\nthen they may not invade, but rather protect and promote, autonomous\ndecision making. If so, this state perfectionism could not be\nresisted by appeal to autonomy\u2019s perfectionist value.\nEven if this argument were accepted, however, it would not\naddress all the concerns that motivate the manipulation\nobjection. That objection points not only to the effect that\nnoncoercive state perfectionism can have on autonomous decision making,\nbut also to its potentially insulting character. And its\npotentially insulting character is a function of the fact that it is\nintentionally undertaken by the state.\n\n\nNoncoercive state perfectionism can take two forms. It might\nbe designed to protect and promote autonomous agency, or it might be\ndesigned to help citizens pursue or engage with valuable options\n(Wall 1998, 197\u2013198). The second form may seem insulting in the\nway that the first is not. For the first form of state\nperfectionism merely seeks to empower citizens to make authentic\ndecisions about how to lead their own lives. It does not attempt\nto encourage them to take up some pursuits over others on the grounds\nthat doing so would constitute a more valuable exercise of their\nautonomous agency. It is possible that people have a fundamental\nright to ethical independence that rules out at least this second form\nof state \n perfectionism.[17]\n\n\nWe cannot escape the influence of our ethical environment: we\nare subject to the examples, exhortations, and celebrations of other\npeople\u2019s ideas about how to live. But we must insist that\nthat environment be created under the aegis of ethical independence:\nthat it be created organically by the decisions of millions of people\nwith the freedom to make their own choices, not through political\nmajorities imposing their decisions on everyone. (Dworkin 2011,\n371)\n\n\nIf there is a right to ethical independence (and if people generally\nbelieved in its existence), then this would help to explain the sense\nof insult mentioned above. State perfectionism, it could be said,\nusurps the responsibility of people to lead their own lives as they see\nfit, provided that they allow others the same freedom. By so\ndoing, it treats adult citizens as if they were children.\n\n\nThe right to ethical independence may be thought to follow from\nsomething even more fundamental\u2014the equal moral status of\ncitizens. State perfectionist measures, whether coercive or not,\nthat aim to encourage some pursuits and discourage others on the\ngrounds that they have greater ethical value offends this status by\npresuming that some citizens are not fully capable of forming, pursuing\nand revising a conception of the good (Quong 2011, 101\u2013106).\nThis denial of equal moral status explains why such measures send an\ninsulting message, one that is objectionable over and above any impact\nit has on the autonomy of citizens.\n\n\nIn response, perfectionists can argue that the purported right to\nethical independence is an exaggeration of an important, but more\nmodest truth. If autonomy is a perfectionist good, and if it is a\ncentral component in a well lived life, then persons have rights to\nmake important life-shaping decisions that governments must\nrespect. By acknowledging and honoring these rights, governments\ntreat their citizens not as children, but as independent moral\nagents. However, these rights do not follow from, or add up to, a\ngeneral right of ethical independence, one that rules out all\ngovernmental efforts to promote the good.\n\n\nFurther, perfectionists can argue that it is no insult to a\nperson\u2019s status as a moral equal to treat him in ways that\npresume that his rational capacities are not perfect, but subject to\nerror. Our capacity to form, pursue and revise a conception of\nthe good, like our capacity for a sense of justice, can lead us to\nmistaken conclusions. When the state supports valuable pursuits\nover worthless ones, it no more denies the equal moral status of those\nwho reject its action than when it enforces a sound conception of\njustice that is in dispute. In both cases, presuming that\ncitizens can make errors does not express the view that they lack, or\nare deficient in, the capacities that constitute equal moral\nstatus.\n3.6 Indirect Arguments\n\n\nThe principle of state neutrality, the harm principle, and the\npurported right to ethical independence all impose moral limits on the\npower of governments to promote the good or the means by which they can\nuse to promote the good. But sometimes it is claimed not that\nperfectionist politics are in principle illegitimate, but rather that\nthey are or would be self-defeating. The best way for the state to\npromote the good, it is sometimes claimed, is for it to refrain\nscrupulously from all direct efforts at promoting the good (Kymlicka\n1990, 199\u2013205). An indirect argument against perfectionist politics\nthus grants that it is permissible for the state to promote good human\nlives, but seeks to shows that efforts by the state to do so will fail.\nIndirect arguments of this kind take different forms. Some arguments\nappeal to the nature of the human good, while others point to the\nincompetence of modern governments.\n\n\nThe most influential argument that appeals to the nature of the\nhuman good holds that for an activity or relationship to improve a\nperson\u2019s life he or she must endorse its value. This argument, which is\noften referred to as the endorsement constraint, holds that\npolitical measures that compel or guide people into activities or\npursuits that they do not value will be counterproductive. These\nmeasures will not improve the lives of anyone; and they may do harm by\ndirecting people away from activities and pursuits that would add value\nto their lives.\n\n\nThe endorsement constraint is based on a simple idea. To add value\nto a human life, an activity or relationship must be affirmed from the\ninside. \u201cNo life goes better by being led from the outside\naccording to values the person does not endorse\u201d (Kymlicka 1990,\n203). Questions can be raised about what constitutes endorsement of an\nactivity. For example, does endorsement require a positive affirmation\nof the value of an activity or does it merely require that one not be\nalienated from it? Different versions of the endorsement constraint can\nbe distinguished depending on how the motive that is taken to condition\nthe value of activities is characterized. And different versions of the\nendorsement constraint will have different implications for state\npolicies. Suppose, for example, that many citizens have no opinion\nwhatsoever on the value of art and that they are induced to attend art\nmuseums because their government gives them a tax break for doing so.\nHere they do not endorse the activity in the strong sense of positively\naffirming its value. Nevertheless, the government policy of giving tax\nbreaks to citizens who attend art museums may do some good if\nendorsement does not require positive affirmation. If the citizens are\nnot alienated from the activity, then they may derive value from\nit.\n\n\nThe endorsement constraint looks particularly compelling when\ncertain examples are considered. To take one such example: it is widely\nthought that for religious worship to add value to a life it must be\ntrue that the person actually sees the value of religious worship from\n\u201cthe inside.\u201d Critics of the endorsement constraint contend\nthat the argument overgeneralizes from these plausible examples (Wall\n1998). Critics also contend that the endorsement constraint has real\nforce when directed at state efforts to compel people to pursue\nparticular activities, but much less force when directed at state\nefforts to discourage, or forbid, certain worthless activities (Hurka\n1995, 47\u201348). For example, if the state criminalizes prostitution, then\nit need not compel anyone to pursue an activity that he or she judges\nto be of no value. Closing off a worthless option can leave many\nworthwhile options open for people to pursue according to their own\njudgments about the value of these options.\n\n\nThe endorsement constraint can be bolstered so that it speaks\nagainst state efforts to screen off bad options, even when these\nefforts leave citizens free to pursue valuable options according to\ntheir own judgments. The endorsement constraint, it is sometimes\nclaimed, is necessary to ensure that people lead lives of ethical\nintegrity. To lead a life of ethical integrity one must respond well to\nthe challenge one\u2019s life presents one with. And such a challenge, or so\nit may be argued, cannot be made better when \u201cit has been\nnarrowed, simplified, and bowdlerized by others in advance\u201d\n(Dworkin 1995, 271).\n\n\nThis defense of the endorsement constraint grounds it in a\nbackground conception of a good human life, one that holds that the\ngoodness of a human life lies in \u201cthe inherent value of a skilled\nperformance of living\u201d (Dworkin 1995, 244). This background\nconception of a good human life (a conception Ronald Dworkin refers to\nas \u201cthe challenge model\u201d) has been subject to telling\ncriticism (Arneson 2003); but its availability nicely illustrates how\nan ethical concern for promoting good human lives can ground resistance\nto perfectionist state policies designed to promote such lives.\n\n\nRather than appealing to a background conception of a good human\nlife, indirect arguments more frequently appeal to more mundane facts\nabout the competence of modern governments. For a variety of reasons,\nit is often thought that modern governments simply are not up to the\ntask of promoting the good. It will be helpful to distinguish local\nfrom global versions of this objection. It might be true that a\nparticular state should not directly promote the good. Those in power\nin this state might hold false beliefs about the good, for example. In\naddition, it might be true that states in general should not directly\npromote certain objective goods. Friendship is a good that plausibly\ncontributes to the objective value of human lives, but if states try to\npromote it directly they may do more harm than good. These are both\ninstances of local worries about perfectionist politics.\n\n\nThe global objection generalizes from either or both of these\nworries. It holds either that all states lack the competence to promote\nthe good or that all (or perhaps most) goods are such that it would be\ncounterproductive for the state directly to promote them. Local worries\nabout the effectiveness of perfectionist politics present no deep\nproblem for perfectionist political theory. No serious writer on\npolitics does not share them to some extent. Global distrust of\nperfectionist politics, however, may seem to present a genuine\nobjection. If global distrust of the competence of modern governments\nto promote the good were warranted, then the best policy for states to\nadopt might be state neutrality. For consequentialist reasons, a\nperfectionist approach to politics could recommend that the state never\naim to promote the good.\n\n\nThe global objection rests on very strong claims. Perfectionists can\nreply that those who advance them exaggerate valid worries about the\npotential for states to abuse their power. In addition, they can argue\nthat the global objection threatens more than perfectionist politics.\nIf states cannot competently promote the good, then, for the same\nreasons, they may not be able to enforce justice competently either\n(Caney 1991). Finally, perfectionists can argue that institutional\nsafeguards, such as legally codified rights, can be effective in\npreventing the abuse of state power, including state power that\npromotes perfectionist goods (Sher 1997).\n\n\nBe this as it may, it is important not to confuse means with ends.\nThe end of perfectionist politics is the protection and promotion of\nobjective goods and/or objectively valuable human lives. The question\nof where and how often the state should rely on indirect, rather than\ndirect, measures to promote the good is a question within perfectionist\npolitical\n theory.[18]\nThough nothing of much importance turns on it, one could categorize a\nview that holds that perfectionist political ends are, for contingent\nreasons, always best pursued indirectly as a genuine instance of\nperfectionism. Indeed, one can imagine a view that holds that\nperfectionist political ends will be best achieved if no state official\naccepts the perfectionist approach to politics. This would be an\nextreme limiting case\u2014a self-effacing perfectionism, but\nperhaps a perfectionist theory of politics nonetheless.\nAlternatively, one might conclude that a perfectionism that always\ncounseled its own rejection would not be worthy of the name.\n4. Conclusion\n\n\nPerfectionism has a distinguished pedigree in the history of ideas,\nbut like many theories in moral and political philosophy it remains\nvery much a work in progress. The topics discussed in this \nentry\u2014perfectionist value theory, perfectionist ethics and\nperfectionism as an approach to politics\u2014are subject to\non-going controversy and development. Moreover, these topics, while\ncomplementary, remain partially independent of one another. It is\npossible to affirm perfectionist ethics and reject perfectionism as an\napproach to politics. Likewise, it is possible to accept some of the\nclaims of perfectionist value theory while rejecting perfectionist\nethical and political conclusions.\n",
