    "main_text": "Nietzsche\u2019s Metaethics || Nietzsche\u2019s Anti-Realism\n3.2 Nietzsche\u2019s Anti-Realism\n\nIf Nietzsche is not a realist about value, then he must be an\nanti-realist: he must deny that there is any objective fact of the\nmatter that would privilege his evaluative perspective over its\ntarget. (This, in fact, is the most familiar reading outside the\nsecondary literature on Nietzsche; one finds this view of\nNietzsche\u2019s metaethics, for example, in the sociologist Max\nWeber and the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, among many\nothers.) We must be careful about the kinds of judgments to which this\nanti-realism applies. Recall that in his critique of morality,\nNietzsche appears to hold that, e.g., \u201cherd\u201d morality is\ngood for the herd, but that it is bad for higher\nmen. He says, for example, that, \u201cThe ideas of the herd\nshould rule in the herd \u2014 but not reach out beyond\nit\u201d (WP 287; emphasis added); and elsewhere he describes slave\nmorality as simply \u201cthe prudence of the lowest order\u201d (GM\nI:13). It may appear that regarding value judgments pertaining to\nwelfare or prudential goodness \u2014 what is good or bad for\nparticular sorts of persons \u2014 Nietzsche believes there is an\nobjective fact of the matter, though one relative to type-facts about\npersons. But this is not right: while Nietzsche believes it is\nobjectively correct that different moralities have certain effects on\ndifferent kinds of people, that these effects are \u201cgood\u201d\nor \u201cbad\u201d itself admits of anti-realist interpretation (cf.\nLeiter 2015: 119 for a revision of the view defended in Leiter 2002).\nEven more importantly, though, Nietzsche\u2019s anti-realism applies\nto the \u201crevaluative\u201d judgment that follows upon these\njudgments about the effects of different moralities: that is, the\njudgment that because herd morality is good for the\nherd but bad for higher men, herd morality (or the universal\nreign of herd morality) is bad or disvaluable. (Leiter 2019: 84\u2013111\nargues that Nietzsche\u2019s anti-realism even extends to epistemic\nvalue, an issue beyond the scope of this entry.)\n\nNietzsche certainly says much that sounds like he is denying the\nobjectivity of values. Zarathustra tells us that, \u201cVerily, men\ngave themselves all their good and evil [Gut und\nB\u00f6se]\u201d (Z I:15) and that \u201cgood and evil that are\nnot transitory do not exist\u201d (Z II:12). In The Gay\nScience, Nietzsche explains that, \u201cWhatever has\nvalue in our world now does not have value in itself,\naccording to its nature \u2014 nature is always value-less, but has\nbeen given value at some time\u201d (301; cf. D 3). Indeed,\nlike certain radical anti-realists, he tends to equate evaluative\nquestions with matters of taste. \u201cWhat is now decisive against\nChristianity is our taste [Geschmack], no longer our\nreasons\u201d (GS 132), he writes, noting later in the same work that\nwhat counts as \u201cjustice\u2026is by all means a matter of\ntaste, nothing more\u201d (GS 184).\n\nNietzsche\u2019s primary argument for anti-realism about value is\nexplanatory: moral facts don\u2019t figure in the\n\u201cbest explanation\u201d of experience, and so are not real\nconstituents of the objective world (Leiter 2019: 17\u201348). Moral\nvalues, in short, can be \u201cexplained away.\u201d Such a\nconclusion follows from Nietzsche\u2019s naturalism (on the latter,\nsee the competing accounts in Janaway 2007 and Leiter 2013). As we saw\nin the context of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality, Nietzsche\nthinks a person\u2019s moral beliefs can be explained in naturalistic\nterms, i.e., in terms of type-facts about that person. Thus, to\nexplain a person\u2019s moral judgments, one needn\u2019t appeal to\nthe existence of objective moral facts: psycho-physical facts about\nthe person suffice. Thus, since non-evaluative type-facts are the\nprimary explanatory facts, and since explanatory power is the mark of\nobjective facts, it appears that there cannot be any value facts.\nMoral judgments and evaluations are \u201cimages\u201d and\n\u201cfantasies,\u201d says Nietzsche, the mere effects of\ntype-facts about agents (D 119).\n\nTo describe Nietzsche as a moral anti-realist is so far only to\nascribe to him a metaphysical view: namely, that there are no\nobjective facts about what is morally right and wrong. It is a\nsomewhat vexed interpretive question whether we should also ascribe to\nNietzsche a particular view about the semantics of moral judgment, a\ntopic about which no philosopher prior to the 20th century\nhad a worked\u2013out view (see again Hussain 2013). For example,\nwhile it seems clear (from the passages quoted above) that Nietzsche\nhas distinct views on the central metaphysical question about value,\nit seems equally apparent that there are inadequate textual resources\nfor ascribing to him a satisfying answer to the semantic question.\nElements of his view, for example, might suggest assimilation to what\nwe would call non-cognitivism and, in particular, expressivism. For\nexample, in describing master and Christian morality as\n\u201copposite forms in the optics of value [Werthe],\u201d\nNietzsche goes on to assert that, as opposite \u201coptical\u201d\nforms, they \u201care\u2026immune to reasons and refutations. One\ncannot refute Christianity; one cannot refute a disease of the\neye\u2026. The concepts \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018untrue\u2019\nhave, as it seems to me, no meaning in optics\u201d (CW Epilogue).\nThis passage \u2014 typical of putatively expressivist passages in\nNietzsche \u2014 is, however, ambiguous. For the passage could mean\nthat \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are meaningless\nnot because evaluative judgments are essentially\nnon-cognitive, but rather because competing evaluative views are\nimmune to the effects of reasoning. There may be rational\ngrounds for thinking one view better than another, perhaps for\nthinking one true and the other false, but since reasoning has so\nlittle impact in this context, it is \u201cmeaningless\u201d (in the\nsense of pointless) to raise issues of truth and falsity.\n\nMore recently, Hussain (2007) has argued that we read Nietzsche as a\nfictionalist about moral value: granted that Nietzsche is an\nanti-realist about value (there exists no objective fact\nabout what has value in-itself), Hussain wonders what it is those who\n\u201ccreate values\u201d can understand themselves to have done?\nValuation, in this Nietzschean world, Hussain argues, involves a kind\nof \u201cmake-believe,\u201d pretending that things are\nvaluable-in-themselves, while knowing that nothing, in fact, has such\nvalue. There is a pressing philosophical question here \u2014 whether\n\u201cmake-believe\u201d about value really could suffice for\nvaluing \u2014 but also an interpretive problem: does Nietzsche\nreally think that moral judgments express beliefs,\nthat is, truth-apt propositional attitudes which then requires\nfictionalist treatment? It would be astonishing if any\n19th-century philosopher were to have a clear\nanswer to such a question (Hussain 2013 seems to have come around to\nthis view).\n\nWhile Nietzsche was, to be sure, among the first to recognize the\nextent to which linguistic and grammatical practices generate\nmetaphysical assumptions and problems, he simply did not view\nmetaphysical questions themselves as best framed as issues\nabout the semantics of a given region of discourse (e.g., are the\nterms genuinely and successfully referential, or are they\n\u201cmerely\u201d expressive?). It is doubtful, then, that there\nare adequate grounds for assigning Nietzsche a view on such subtle\nmatters as whether ethical language is primarily cognitive or\nnon-cognitive, when it clearly evinces aspects of both descriptive and\nprescriptive discourse.\n\nTwo aspects of Nietzsche\u2019s work may, however, seem to be in\ntension with value anti-realism, even understood as only a\nmetaphysical doctrine: first, his reliance on the distinction between\n\u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d types of human beings;\nand second, the force and seriousness with which he presents his\nevaluative judgments.\n\nAs we saw, above, Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality presupposes a\ndistinction between higher and lower types of people. But are there\nobjective facts about who is \u201chigh\u201d and who is\n\u201clow\u201d? And if so, would such a view be compatible with\nanti-realism?\n\nSuppose there are objective facts about \u201chigh\u201d and\n\u201clow\u201d: Goethe really is a higher type, and the\nherd animal really is a lower type. But there is still no\nobjective fact about whether MPS is non-prudentially\ndisvaluable just because it has the effect of thwarting the\nflourishing of objectively higher types. Realism about\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d does not entail realism about\nnon-prudential value, so the argument might go.\n\nSuch a response cannot work for two reasons. First, the judgment that\n\u201cX is a higher person\u201d includes a significant evaluative\ncomponent: \u201cGoethe is a higher type\u201d is not\nevaluatively neutral in the manner of \u201cGoethe is a\ntaller than average type.\u201d In saying that someone is a\nhigher type, we seem committed to some positive evaluative attitude\ntowards that person (e.g., that it is good to have persons like that\naround). If there is an objective fact that \u201cX is a higher\ntype,\u201d and it is a fact that MPS thwarts the flourishing of\nhigher types, then it would seem that at least some objective weight\nmust accrue to the Nietzschean position that MPS is disvaluable\nbecause of this effect it has.\n\nSecond, if it is an objective fact that Goethe is a higher type and,\nsay, Hitler is a herd animal, then the following counterfactual would\nseem to be true:\n\n(C) If Hitler had been like Goethe, he would have been better off.\n\n\nHe would have been better off because he would have been a higher\ntype, instead of a lower type \u2014 and it is an objective fact that\nthe high are really high, and the low are really\nlow. But this seemingly objective judgment \u2014 that Hitler would\nhave been better off had he been more like Goethe \u2014 is\na non-prudential value judgment; it is not a judgment about what is\ngood for Hitler under the circumstances, but rather a judgment about\nwhat would make Hitler better off, but for his circumstances. In\ngeneral, it seems that conceding the objectivity of \u201chigh\u201d\nand \u201clow\u201d permits one to make objective non-prudential\nvalue judgments like: the good of the higher type is superior to the\ngood of the lower type.\n\nFor these reasons, if Nietzsche is an anti-realist about\nnon-prudential moral value, then he must also be an anti-realist about\njudgments of \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow,\u201d It may be an\nobjective fact that MPS thwarts the flourishing of those Nietzsche\nregards as higher types; but it is not an objective fact that\nthey are really higher.\n\nIn fact, there is textual evidence that this is exactly\nNietzsche\u2019s view. For example, in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, Nietzsche writes that, \u201cGood and evil, and\nrich and poor, and high and low [Hoch und Gering], and all\nthe names of values \u2014 arms shall they be and clattering signs\nthat life must overcome itself again and again\u201d (Z II:7). Here\nNietzsche is explicit that \u201chigh and low\u201d are simply\n\u201cnames of values,\u201d just like \u201cgood and evil.\u201d\nBut since, as we have just seen, Nietzsche is an anti-realist about\nthese latter evaluative concepts, it should hardly be surprisingly\nthat he is an anti-realist about the former.\n\nThe actual contexts in which Nietzsche marks traits as\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d invite the same reading.\nConsider, for example, the exposition in the Genealogy (I:14)\nof the sense in which slave morality is the \u201cprudence of the\nlowest order\u201d (GM, I:13). According to Nietzsche, slave morality\ntakes certain typical characteristics of the \u201clowest\norder\u201d and redescribes them in morally praiseworthy lights. So,\nfor example, their impotence becomes \u201cgoodness of heart,\u201d\ntheir anxious lowliness becomes \u201chumility,\u201d their\n\u201cinoffensiveness\u201d and \u201clingering at the door\u201d\nbecomes \u201cpatience\u201d, and their desire for retaliation\nbecomes a desire for justice. If Nietzsche were really a realist about\nthe concept of \u201clowness\u201d, then we ought to be able to\nidentify the objective facts in virtue of which something is really\nlow. Yet when Nietzsche tries to describe all patience as\nnothing more than a \u201clingering at the door\u201d and\nall humility as simply \u201canxious lowliness,\u201d it is\nnatural to think that there is no \u201cobjective\u201d fact about\n\u201clowness\u201d here but simply a polemical and evaluatively\nloaded characterization. To think that all humility is really\n\u201canxious lowliness\u201d is just to identify oneself as one who\nshares Nietzsche\u2019s evaluative sensibility, one \u201cwhose ears\nare related to ours\u201d (GS 381), one \u201cpredisposed and\npredestined\u201d for Nietzsche\u2019s insights (BGE 30). In short,\ngiven the way in which Nietzsche actually speaks of the\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow,\u201d we should understand\nNietzsche\u2019s metaethical position as also characterizing these\nterms: to say that \u201cX is low\u201d is not to describe an\nobjective fact, but rather to identify oneself as sharing in a certain\nevaluative sensibility or taste.\n\nThere remains a final interpretive difficulty: for Nietzsche simply\ndoes not write like someone who thinks his evaluative judgments are\nmerely his idiosyncratic preferences! On the metaethical position\nelaborated here, it seems Nietzsche must believe that if, in response\nto his point that \u201cmorality were to blame if the highest\npower and splendor actually possible to the type man was never in\nfact attained\u201d (GM Pref:6), someone were to say, \u201cSo much\nthe better for morality!\u201d, there would be nothing further to say\nto that person: at the best, Nietzsche might turn his back and say,\n\u201cOh well \u2014 doesn\u2019t share my evaluative\ntastes.\u201d Yet there seems to be a substantial amount of\nNietzschean rhetoric (see, e.g., BGE 259; TI V:6 & IX:35; EH IV:4,\n7, 8) that cannot be reconciled with this metaethical view, and which\ncries out instead for some sort of realist construal. Three sorts of\nconsiderations, however, block the inference from Nietzsche\u2019s\nrhetoric to the conclusion that he embraced a realist metaphysics of\nvalue.\n\nFirst, while the rhetoric is forceful, the language of truth and\nfalsity is conspicuously absent. As some of the passages quoted above\nsuggest, Nietzsche writes with great force and passion in opposition\nto MPS. But it is striking that he does not use the epistemic value\nterms \u2014 the language of truth and falsity, real and unreal\n\u2014 in this context. This, of course, might not be notable, except\nfor the fact that in his equally forceful attacks on, e.g., Christian\ncosmology, or religious interpretations of natural events, he invokes\nthe conceptual apparatus of truth and falsity, truth and lie, reality\nand appearance, all the time (cf. Leiter 1994, pp. 336\u2013338).\nThus, for example, Nietzsche lampoons Christian cosmology as lacking\n\u201ceven a single point of contact with reality\u201d and as\n\u201cpure fiction\u201d which\n\u201cfalsifies\u2026reality\u201d (\u201cdie Wirklichtkeit\nf\u00e4lscht\u201d) (A, 15). Such epistemic value terms are\nstrikingly absent in Nietzsche\u2019s remarks about value. One\nnatural explanation for this difference in rhetoric \u2014 natural\nespecially in light of the substantial evidence for his anti-realism\n\u2014 is precisely that in the moral case he does not think there is\nany fact of the matter.\n\nSecond, in undertaking a \u201crevaluation of all values,\u201d\nNietzsche, as we have seen, wants to alert \u201chigher\u201d types\nto the fact that MPS is not, in fact, conducive to their flourishing.\nThus, he needs to \u201cwake up\u201d his appropriate readers\n\u2014 those whose \u201cears are related\u201d to his \u2014 to\nthe dangers of MPS, a task made all the more difficult by MPS\u2019s\npretension to be \u201cmorality itself.\u201d Given, then, that\nNietzsche\u2019s target is a certain sort of misunderstanding on the\npart of higher men, and given the difficulty of supplanting the norms\nthat figure in this misunderstanding (the norms of MPS), it should be\nunsurprising that Nietzsche writes with passion and force: he must\nshake higher types out of their intuitive commitment to the moral\ntraditions of two millennia! Moreover, Nietzsche\u2019s naturalism,\nand the prominent role it assigns to non-conscious drives and\ntype-facts, leads him to be skeptical about the efficacy of reasons\nand arguments. But a skeptic about the efficacy of rational persuasion\nmight very well opt for persuasion through other rhetorical\ndevices.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, a rhetorical tone like\nNietzsche\u2019s \u2014 looked at in the context of his life \u2014\ndoes not really suggest realism about the content, but rather\ndesperation on the part of the author to reach an increasingly distant\nand uninterested audience. The Nietzsche who was almost completely\nignored during the years before illness erased his intellect and\ndeprived him of his sanity might have resorted to more and more\nstrident and violent rhetoric in frustration over not being heard\n\u2014 and not because he was a realist. Indeed, in the absence of\nexplicit evidence of value realism, this seems the most plausible\nexplanation for the vast majority of the passages with which we have\nbeen concerned in this section.\n\nFor these various reasons, then, the character of Nietzsche\u2019s\nrhetoric can be understood as compatible with his anti-realism about\nvalue.\n",
