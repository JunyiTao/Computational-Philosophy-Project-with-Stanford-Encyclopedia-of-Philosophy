The Public/Private Split and Its Implications\n\nLiberal, Marxist and radical feminists have all characterized women as\ndoubly alienated in capitalism because of the public/private split\nthat relegates their work as mothers and houseworkers to the home, and\npsychologically denies them full personhood, citizenship and human\nrights (Foreman 1974, Okin 1989, Pateman 1988, Goldman 1969). Noting\nthat women workers on average only have about 70% of the average\nsalary of men in the contemporary U.S., feminists have claimed this is\nbecause women\u2019s work, tied stereotypically to housework and\nhence thought unskilled is undervalued, whether it is cleaning or rote\nservice work, or nurturing work thought to be connected to natural\nmaternal motivations and aptitudes. Hence some feminists have\norganized in campaigns for \u201ccomparable worth\u201d to raise\nwomen\u2019s wages to the same as men\u2019s wages involving\ncomparable skills (Brenner 2000; cf. also articles in Hansen and\nPhilipson eds. 1990).\n\nMany radical feminists maintain that women\u2019s work is part of a\nseparate patriarchal mode of reproduction that underlies all economic\nsystems of production and in which men exploit women\u2019s\nreproductive labor (Delphy 1984; O\u2019Brien 1981; Leghorn and\nParker 1981; Rich 1980; Mies 1986). Smith (1974), O\u2019Brien\n(1981), Hartsock (1983 a,b), Haraway (1985) and Harding (1986)\npioneered in combining this radical feminist assumption with a\nperspectival Marxist theory of knowledge to argue that one\u2019s\nrelation to the work of production and reproduction gave each gender\nand each social class a different way of knowing the social totality.\nWomen\u2019s work, they argued, ties them to nature and human needs\nin a different way than men\u2019s work does, which creates the\npossibility of a less alienated and more comprehensive understanding\nof the workings of the social totality. Patricia Hill Collins argues\nfurther that the racial division of labor, institutional racism and\ndifferent family structures put African American women in yet a\ndifferent epistemic relation to society than white and other women\n(2000). Writing in a post-modernist re-articulation of this feminist\nstandpoint theory, Donna Haraway argues that the breakdown of the\nnature/culture distinction because of scientific technology and its\nalteration of the human body makes us into \u201ccyborgs\u201d.\nHence our perspectives are so intersectional that they cannot be\nunified simply by a common relation to work. What is required for a\nfeminist politics is not a situated identity politics, whether of\ngender and/or race and/or class, but an affinity politics based on\nalliances and coalitions that combine epistemic perspectives (Haraway\n1985).\n\nLike these radical feminists, some socialist-feminists have tried to\ndevelop a \u201cdual systems\u201d theory (cf. Young 1981). This\ninvolves theorizing a separate system of work relations that organizes\nand directs human sexuality, nurturance, affection and biological\nreproduction. Rather than seeing this as an unchanging universal base\nfor patriarchy, however, they have argued that this system, thought of\nas the \u201csex/gender system\u201d (Rubin 1975; Hartmann 1978,\n1981a,b), or as \u201csex/affective production\u201d (Ferguson 1989,\n1991; Ferguson and Folbre 1981) has different historical modes, just\nas Marx argued that economies do. Rubin argues that sex/gender systems\nhave been based in different kinship arrangements, most of which have\nsupported the exchange of women by men in marriage, and hence have\nsupported male domination and compulsory heterosexuality. She is\nhopeful that since capitalism shifted the organization of the economy\nfrom kinship to commodity production, the power of fathers and\nhusbands over daughters and wives, and the ability to enforce\nheterosexuality, will continue to decline, and women\u2019s\nincreasing ability to be economically independent will lead to\nwomen\u2019s liberation and equality with men.\n\nWith a different historical twist, Hartmann argues that a historical\nbargain was cemented between capitalist and working class male\npatriarchs to shore up patriarchal privileges that were being weakened\nby the entrance of women into wage labor in the 19th\ncentury by the creation of the \u201cfamily wage\u201d to allow men\nsufficient wages to support a non-wage-earning wife and children at\nhome (1981a). While Ferguson and Folbre (1981) agree that there is no\ninevitable fit between capitalism and patriarchy, they argue that\nthere are conflicts, and that the family wage bargain has broken down\nat present. Indeed, both Ferguson and Smart (1984) argue that welfare\nstate capitalism and the persistent sexual division of wage labor in\nwhich work coded as women\u2019s is paid less than men\u2019s with\nless job security are ways that a \u201cpublic patriarchy\u201d has\nreplaced different systems of family patriarchy that were operating in\nearly and pre-capitalist societies. Walby (1990) has a similar\nanalysis, but to her the connection between forms of capitalism and\nforms of patriarchy is more functional and less accidental than it\nappears to Ferguson and Smart.\n\nWalby argues that there are two different basic forms of patriarchy\nwhich emerge in response to the tensions between capitalist economies\nand patriarchal household economies: private and public patriarchy.\nPrivate patriarchy as a form is marked by excluding women from\neconomic and political power while public patriarchy works by\nsegregating women. There is a semi-automatic re-adjustment of the dual\nsystems when the older private father patriarchy based on the\npatriarchal family is broken down due to the pressures of early\nindustrial capitalism. The family wage and women\u2019s second class\ncitizenship that marked that initial re-adjustment are then\nfunctionally replaced by a public form of patriarchy, the patriarchal\nwelfare state, where women enter the wage labor force permanently but\nin segregated less well paid jobs. But Ferguson (1989,1991), Smart\n(1984) and Folbre (1994) suggest that although the patriarchal control\nof fathers and husbands over wife and children as economic assets has\nbeen diminished in advanced capitalism, there is always a dialectical\nand contradictory tension between patriarchy and capitalism in which\nboth advances and retreats for women\u2019s equality as citizens and\nin work relations are constantly occurring in the new form of public\npatriarchy. Thus, the new \u201cmarriage\u201d of patriarchal\ncapitalism operates to relegate women to unpaid or lesser paid caring\nlabor, whether in the household or in wage labor, thus keeping women\nby and large unequal to men. This is especially notable in the rise of\npoor single-mother-headed families. However, as it forces more and\nmore women into wage labor, women are given opportunities for some\nindependence from men and the possibility to challenge male dominance\nand sex segregation in all spheres of social life. Examples are the\nrise of the first and second wave women\u2019s movements and\nconsequent gains in civil rights for women.\n\nThe work of feminist sociologist Dorothy Smith (1989) has been a\nnotable intervention into the public-private split by bringing into\nview the institutions and power regimes that regulate the everyday\nworld, their gender subtext, and basis in a gendered division of\nlabor. Legal feminist critics expand on the biopolitics of the\npatriarchal welfare state, which psychiatrizes as it threatens mothers\nwith the loss of child custody. This represents a new eugenics twist\non the enduring mistrust of working-class mothers and casting those\nwho are imprisoned as undeserving parent (Guggenheim 2007; Law 2012).\nAfrican American mothers bear the brunt of punitive and racist family\nand criminal law (Roberts 2022; Thompson 2010; Solinger et\nal. 2010).\n",
