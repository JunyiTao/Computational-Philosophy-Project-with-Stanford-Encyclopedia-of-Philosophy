    "main_text": "The Role of the Critic and Schlegel\u2019s Romantic Nationalism || Nationalism versus Cosmopolitanism\n6.2 Nationalism versus Cosmopolitanism\n\nThrough his translations and essays A.W. Schlegel intended to make\nforeign literary traditions and literary works accessible to the\nGerman public, but he also thought that the opposite was necessary.\nThat is, Schlegel understood that his task as an art critic was also\nto defend and disseminate German culture, within Germany and\nthroughout Europe. Indeed, Schlegel\u2019s preoccupation with the\nhistorical and cultural diversities had two different, even opposite,\nconsequences. On the one hand it made Schlegel\u2019s approach to\ndifferent cultures and their artistic production much more tolerant,\nbecause he was aware of the fact that one needs to immerse oneself in\ntheir culture in order to grasp the universal or poetical nature of\nthe particular work of art and avoid a provincial attitude. In fact,\nSchlegel liked to think of himself as a citizen of the world. But, on\nthe other hand, it led him to harbor a certain nationalistic\nsentiment, which he projected both abroad and to the German literati.\nSo, as well as restoring German culture (many of his writings can be\nregarded as a manifesto of German Romanticism and German philosophy),\nhe also encouraged his fellow countrymen, in a highly patriotic tone,\nto become deeply national and historical and to depict \u201cwhat\nGermans of olden times were and what they should become again\u201d,\nlest they should lose their \u201cunity as Germans\u201d (LDA: 441).\nSchlegel believed that for the true potential of Romantic literature\nto be realized in Germany, Germans needed to regain an interest in the\ngreat events of their history and in their identity as an independent\nnation (Carlson 1994: 143).\n\nIn his late essay Abri\u00df von den Europ\u00e4ischen\nVerh\u00e4ltnissen der Deutschen Literatur (1825), written for an\nEnglish audience, he repeats an idea he had also defended in his\nLectures on Dramatic Art, namely that German literature was\nyoung because of the historical evolution of the German language, and\nnot because of its qualities (LDA: 421, SW: VIII, 207). Schlegel\nfervently defended German authors (such as Klopstock, Lessing,\nWinkelmann, Wieland, Goethe, or Herder) as well as German\nphilosophers, from the English accusations of being abstract and\nobscure (SW: VIII, 212). He also claimed that Germans were the most\ncosmopolitan and intellectual leaders of European culture, and that\nGermany had reached its maturity, its autonomy, and hence its freedom\n(SW: VIII, 214). This is why, for Schlegel, Germany had a central role\nin the development of European culture: in the recuperation of the\nRoman and Greek cultures, which were the very foundations of Europe.\nThe evidence of this \u2018superiority\u2019 would lie in the\ndevelopment of natural sciences, philosophy, and the critical\ninterpretation of classical texts (SW: VII, 214\u2013217). In short,\nA.W. Schlegel\u2019s concern became more and more a problem of\nnational identity (Schmelling 1994: 35\u201336). But, at the same\ntime, these assertions must be seen against the background of his\nstatements from earlier texts, such as the Wettstreit der\nSprachen (The Contest of Languages) from 1798, in which\nSchlegel develops his idea of a \u201ccosmopolitan literature\u201d\n(Albrecht 2005: 307) and seems to criticize and make fun of all forms\nof nationalism. As Andrea Albrecht argues, Schlegel\u2019s engagement\nwith translations, investigation, and dissemination of European and\nnon-European literature, must be seen as a sign and proof of his\ncosmopolitanism. In the third part of his Berlin lectures\nfrom 1803, Schlegel expresses his desire that all different\nnationalities be united. But, again, this desire to transcend national\nboarders seems to go hand in hand with the necessity of establishing\nGermany as the new \u201ccenter for the human spirit\u201d (quoted\nin Albrecht 2005: 308, my translation), the rationale behind this\nbeing, that \u201cuniversality, cosmopolitanism, is the real German\ncharacteristic\u201d (VLK: III, 36). Undoubtedly, Schlegel\u2019s\ncosmopolitanism is uncannily mixed up with a strange form of blind,\nromantic nationalism.\n\nAfter the disastrous consequences of German nationalism during the\n20th century, and the fact that \n\n\nit is also a common view that \u201cpolitical romanticism\u201d, in\nits regard for organic community, was a precursor to Nazism, (Black\n1964: 32) \n\n\nsuch \u2018romantic\u2019 nationalistic statements are not received\nwithout a certain apprehension. However, without trying to solve the\nambivalent character of the Romantic political program, it is\nimportant to note how these very statements show that Schlegel was not\nan impartial critic. He too was in some way trapped in what he called\nthe Romantic spirit, despite his efforts to contemplate art, history,\nand society from a neutral perspective. In explaining the spirit\nof the Romantic, Schlegel himself is being very\nromantic. The very division he made between the ancient and\nthe modern, as well as his views of Shakespeare, Aristophanes, or the\nGreeks as a people who were \n\n\nconscious of no wants, and aspired at no higher perfection than that\nwhich they could actually attain by the exercise of their own\nfaculties, (LDA: 9) \n\n\nwere inevitably influenced by his own time.\n",
