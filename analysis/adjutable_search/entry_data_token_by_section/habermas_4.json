Habermas\u2019s Mature Social Theory: The Theory of Communicative Action\n\n\nThe idea of reason, which is differentiated in the various claims to\nvalidity, is necessarily built into the way in which the species of\ntalking animals reproduces itself. (2001a: chapter 5, 85)\n\n\nHabermas\u2019s mature work begins with The Theory of\nCommunicative Action (1981 [1984a/1987]), the fruits of a long\nand difficult decade he spent at the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg\n(M\u00fcller-Doohm 2016: 214). It is an ambitious and wide-ranging\nwork, which provides a general framework within which several related\nresearch programs are arranged. It comprises:\n\nA sketch of a unified theory of meaning and action.\nA typological theory of social action.\nA social ontology.\nAn outline of a critical social theory tied to (1)\u2013(3).\n\n\nThis section will discuss these topics in turn.\n",
