    "main_text": "Objections to Externalist Versions of Foundationalism || Challenges to Sufficiency: Norman and Truetemp\n7.1 Challenges to Sufficiency: Norman and Truetemp\n\nThe very ease with which the externalist can potentially broaden the\nfoundational base of knowledge or justified belief is, ironically, one\nof the primary concerns of those philosophers unhappy with externalist\nepistemology. One of the best-known objections to externalism attempts\nto show that the externalist\u2019s conditions for foundational\nbelief are not sufficient for justification. Recall that for the\nreliabilist a belief is justified if it is the product of a reliable\nbelief-independent process and there are no defeaters for the belief\navailable to the subject. Consider BonJour\u2019s (1985: ch. 3) case\nof Norman: We can imagine that Norman is a highly reliable\nclairvoyant, that his clairvoyance produces a belief that the\nPresident is in New York. Suppose also that he does not realize that\nhe is a clairvoyant, and that he has no reasons or evidence for or\nagainst the belief or the reliability of whatever process produced it.\nIntuitively, Norman\u2019s belief is unjustified. Or consider\nLehrer\u2019s (1990) case of Truetemp, who, without knowing it, has a\nchip implanted in his head that produces very precise and highly\naccurate beliefs about the ambient temperature. Truetemp often gets\ntemperature beliefs from the operation of the chip, but he has never\nchecked their correctness. Intuitively, Truetemp\u2019s belief that\nthe temperature is now exactly 47 degrees is not justified.\nReliabilism seems to yield the wrong result, justifying too many\nbeliefs.\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to respond to such cases. One\nresponse is defended by Bergmann (2006: ch. 1 and 2) and was already\ndiscussed above in connection with regress problems for access\ninternalism\n (section 3.1).\n Proponents of the objection often claim that what the cases suggest\nis that there must be something the subject is aware of or has access\nto that makes a difference to his perspective on the truth or\nappropriateness of the belief. Bergmann argues that this requirement,\nas tempting or intuitive as it may be, leads to serious regress\nproblems. (For some replies on behalf of internalism, see Rogers and\nMatheson 2011, Hasan 2011, and Fales 2014.)\n\nMany others attempt to accommodate these intuitions in some way.\nGoldman (1986) argues that in the cases described it is natural to\nthink that subjects like Norman do have defeaters available, and this\nexplains our intuition to regard them as unjustified. However, many,\nincluding some other reliabilists, think it is easy to further specify\nor amend the cases to ensure that the defeaters are not available\n(Lyons 2009: 123\u20134). Some accept a modest form of internalism,\nintroducing a relatively weak access requirement, e.g., that the\nsubject must have an experience or accessible mental state that is in\nfact a reliable way to arrive at beliefs, though the subject need not\nhave access to the reliability of the experience (Alston 1989).\nHowever, there seem to be many possible cases, including versions of\nthe cases of Norman and Truetemp, where these conditions are satisfied\nbut the intuition is the same; we might suppose for example that some\nphenomenological sensation, like some unusual sort of itch, headache,\nor olfactory sensation, is in fact a highly reliable indicator of the\ntruth of their beliefs regarding the whereabouts of the President or\nthe ambient temperature. This intuitively makes no difference when\nthey are unaware that it is reliable (see Lyons 2009: 125).\n\nA more recent attempt to respond to the Norman and Truetemp cases adds\na restriction for basic or foundational beliefs: they must be\nperceptual beliefs, beliefs produced by a \u201cperceptual\nsystem\u201d (see Lyons 2009: ch. 4, for more on what counts as a\nperceptual system). Lyons (2009: ch. 5) argues that the original\nNorman case doesn\u2019t specify whether the belief is a product of a\nperceptual system, and in the Truetemp case it is the product of an\nimplanted chip and not a perceptual system; he also argues that once\nwe change the details to make the beliefs the result of perceptual\nsystems the intuitions seem to change. For example, imagine that\nNorman* is like Norman except that he belongs to an alien species all\nmembers of which have clairvoyant abilities, thanks to their evolved\nperceptual organs and reliable processes of information transfer.\nLyons claims that, intuitively, someone like Norman*\u2019s belief\nthat the President is in New York is justified, even if Norman* is not\naware of the existence or reliability of such processes.\n\nJust as the cases of Norman and Truetemp are designed to show that\nreliabilism makes getting foundational justification too easy, other,\nsimilar cases seem to show that reliabilism make getting\nnonfoundational justification too easy. Suppose, for example,\nthat while you are asleep a group of logician-neuroscientists implant\na device in your head that takes some of your highly reliable\nfoundational beliefs (say, introspective or perceptual beliefs) as\ninput and responds by selecting at random from a list of complex\ntheorems of logic and producing a belief in that theorem. Intuitively,\nsuch beliefs are not justified despite their high degree of\nreliability. (This example is taken from Lyons 2009: 126). One\nintuitive diagnosis is that the relation between the output beliefs\nand input beliefs is not evidential or inferential, or the process by\nwhich the output beliefs are generated is not an evidential or\ninferential one. The challenge for the reliabilist who wants to avoid\nsaying that such beliefs are justified, and avoid adding internalist\nconstraints, is to provide a better account of inferential processes.\nTo retain its externalism, the account must not have good inference\ndepend on awareness of or access to the connection between\npropositions believed.\n",
