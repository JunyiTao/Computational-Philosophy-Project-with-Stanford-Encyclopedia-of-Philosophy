    "main_text": "Freedom of conscience || Freedom of conscience and conscientious objection today\n6.1 Freedom of conscience and conscientious objection today\n\nFreedom of conscience is today protected by the United Nations\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which reads: \u201cEveryone\nhas the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d\n(art. 18).\n\nAccording to Strohm, this article should not be taken to imply freedom\nto act according to one\u2019s conscience, but it only refers to\n\u201cmatters of inward conviction\u201d (Strohm 2011: 88). If this\ninterpretation is correct, article 18 does not seem to raise any\ninteresting philosophical or practical problem today, as very few\npeople today would deny freedom in matters of inward\nconviction. More problematic is the moral and political debate about\nthe freedom to act, or to refrain from acting,\naccording to one\u2019s conscience, especially where there are\nprofessional roles or legal obligations that would demand otherwise.\nIn fact, appeals to conscience and freedom of conscience are often\ndeployed to claim and justify \u201cconscientious objection\u201d to\ncertain activities that someone would otherwise be required to\nperform.\n\nOne example is conscientious objection to the military service where\nconscription is in place. Although originally conscientious objection\nto war was mainly a religious issue (the Quakers were the most famous\ngroup of conscientious objectors to war), in more recent times the\nobjection to war has been put forward and granted without explicit\nreference to any religious justification (Moskos and Chamber\n1993).\n\nAs most States have now abolished conscription, appeals to freedom of\nconscience and to conscientious objection today can be found mainly in\ndebates in medical ethics with regard to health practitioners who\nconscientiously object to performing medical procedures they morally\noppose, such as abortions (for overviews of the debate in medical\nethics, see Wicclair 2011; Wester 2015).\n\nAccording to those who are against a right to conscientious objection,\nprofessional obligations trump any value conscience might have and any\nprinciple that might justify conscientious objection qua\nconscientious (e.g., Savulescu 2006; Giubilini 2014 and 2017,\nSavulescu and Schuklenk 2017); according to defenders of conscientious\nobjection, professionals\u2019 conscience must be protected to the\nlargest extent possible, i.e., up to the point where respecting\nconscience would significantly jeopardize physical or psychological\nhealth of patients (e.g., Sulmasy 2008; Wicclair 2011), a compromise\nthat, depending on circumstances\u2014for example a too high\npercentage of objecting practitioners which would make it nearly\nimpossible to refer patients to non-objecting doctors\u2014might be\nvery difficult to achieve (Minerva 2015). Between these two stances,\nthere are positions that are neither for nor against conscientious\nobjection in principle, but pose tighter restrictions to those who\nadvance conscientious objection (McLeod 2020), for example the\nrequirement to provide reasons for the objection, and to submit such\nreasons to public scrutiny or experts\u2019 assessment of the\nreasonability of one\u2019s objection (Card 2007, Card 2020), or the\nqualification that objection can only be justified if consistent with\nthe internal values of the profession (Wicclair 2000; Deans 2013).\n\n\nHowever, if it is the validity or the soundness of the reasons\nprovided which is considered relevant for the justification of\nconscientious objection, it seems that the value of conscience and the\nprinciple of freedom of conscience are no longer at stake. What makes\nan objection good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, has nothing to\ndo with its being conscientious, unless we add a \u201cgenuineness\nrequirement\u201d (e.g., Meyers and Woods 1996) to an assessment of\nthe legitimacy of a conscientious objection, whereby professional need\nto demonstrate that the moral beliefs at stake are deeply and\nsincerity held. The interesting question in this case would be whether\na test can be devised that can reliably track genuine conscientious\nobjections.\n",
