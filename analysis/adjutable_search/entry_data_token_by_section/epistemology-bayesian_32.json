    "main_text": "The Problem of Idealization || Striving for Ideals\n6.2 Striving for Ideals\n\nProbabilism is often thought to have a counterexample to this effect:\nit implies that we should meet a very high standard, but it is not the\ncase that we should, because we cannot. In reply, some Bayesians hold\nthat this is actually not a counterexample, and that the apparent\ncounterexample can be explained away once an appropriate reading of\n\u2018ought\u2019 is in place and clearly distinguished from another\nreading.\n\nTo see that there are two readings of \u2018ought\u2019, think about\nthe following scenario. Suppose that this is true:\n\n\n (i) We ought to launch a war now.\n\n\n\nThe truth of this particular norm might sound like a counterexample to\nthe general norm below:\n\n\n (ii) There ought to be no war.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps there can be a context in which (i) and (ii) are both true\nand hence the former is not a counterexample to the latter. An example\nis the context in which we know for sure that we are able to launch a\nwar that ends all existing wars. Indeed, the occurrences of\n\u2018ought\u2019 in those two sentences seem to have very different\nreadings. Sentence (ii) can be understood to express a norm which\nportrays what the state of the world ought to be\nlike\u2014what the world would be like if things were ideal.\nSuch a norm is often called an ought-to-be norm or\nevaluative norm, pointing to one or another ideal. On the\nother hand, sentence (i) can be understood as a norm which specifies\nwhat an agent ought to do in a less-than-ideal situation that\nshe turns out to be in\u2014possibly with the goal to improve the\nexisting situation and bring it closer to the ideal specified by an\nought-to-be norm, or at least to prevent the situation from getting\nworse. This kind of norm is often called an ought-to-do norm,\na deliberative norm, or a prescriptive norm. So,\nalthough the truth of (i) can sound like a counterexample to (ii), the\ntension between the two seems to disappear with appropriate readings\nof \u2018ought\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, suppose that an ordinary human has some incoherent\ncredences, and that it is not the case that she ought to remove the\nincoherence right away because she has not detected the incoherence.\nThe norm just stated can be thought of as an ought-to-do norm and,\nhence, need not be taken as a counterexample to Probabilism construed\nas an ought-to-be norm:\n\n\nProbabilism (Ought-to-Be Version). It\nought to be that one\u2019s credences fit together in the\nprobabilistic way.\n\n\n\nThe ought-to-be reading of \u2018ought\u2019 has been employed\nimplicitly or explicitly to defend Bayesian norms\u2014not just by\nBayesian philosophers (Zynda 1996; Christensen 2004: ch. 6; Titelbaum\n2013a: ch. 3 and 4; Wedgwood 2014; Eder forthcoming), but also by\nBayesian psychologists (Baron 2012). The distinction between the\nought-to-be and the ought-to-do oughts is most often defended in the\nbroader context of normative studies, such as in deontic logic\n(Casta\u00f1eda 1970; Horty 2001: sec. 3.3 and 3.4) and in\nmetaethics (Broome 1999; Wedgwood 2006; Schroeder 2011).\n\nThe ought-to-be construal of Probabilism still leaves us a\nprescriptive issue: How should a person go about detecting and fixing\nthe incoherence of one\u2019s credences, noting that it is absurd to\nstrive for coherence at all costs? This is an issue about\nought-to-do/prescriptive norms, addressed by a prescriptive research\nprogram in an area of psychology called judgment and decision\nmaking. For a survey of that area, see Baron (2004, 2012) and\nElqayam & Evans (2013). In fact, many psychologists even think\nthat, for better or worse, this prescriptive program has become the\n\u201cnew paradigm\u201d in the psychology of reasoning; for\nreferences, see Elqayam & Over (2013).\n\nThe prescriptive issue mentioned above raises some other questions.\nThere is an empirical, computational question: What is the\nextent to which a human brain can approximate the Bayesian ideal of\nsynchronic and diachronic coherence? See Griffiths, Kemp, &\nTenenbaum (2008) for a survey of some recent results. And there are\nphilosophical questions: Why is it epistemically better for a\nhuman\u2019s credences to be less incoherent? Speaking of being\nless incoherent, how can we develop a measure of degrees of\nincoherence? See de Bona & Staffel (2018) and Staffel (2019) for\nproposals.\n",
