    "main_text": "The Connectionist Challenge\n5. The Connectionist Challenge\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, cognitive scientists almost universally\nmodeled mental activity as rule-governed symbol manipulation. In the\n1980s, connectionism gained currency as an alternative computational\nframework. Connectionists employ computational models, called\nneural networks, that differ quite significantly from\nTuring-style models. There is no central processor. There are no\nmemory locations for symbols to be inscribed. Instead, there is a\nnetwork of nodes bearing weighted connections to one another.\nDuring computation, waves of activation spread through the network. A\nnode\u2019s activation level depends upon the weighted activations of\nthe nodes to which it is connected. Nodes function somewhat\nanalogously to neurons, and connections between nodes function\nsomewhat analogously to synapses. One should receive the\nneurophysiological analogy cautiously, as there are numerous important\ndifferences between neural networks and actual neural configurations\nin the brain (Bechtel & Abramson 2002: 341\u2013343;\nBerm\u00fadez 2010: 237\u2013239; Clark 2014: 87\u201389; Harnish\n2002: 359\u2013362).\n\nConnectionists raise many objections to the classical computational\nparadigm (Rumelhart, McClelland, & the PDP Research Group 1986;\nHorgan & Tienson 1996; McLaughlin & Warfield 1994; Bechtel\n& Abrahamsen 2002), such as that classical systems are not\nbiologically realistic or that they are unable to model certain\npsychological tasks. Classicists in turn launch various arguments\nagainst connectionism. The most famous arguments showcase\nproductivity, systematicity of thought, and systematicity of thinking.\nFodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argue that these phenomena support classical\nCTM over connectionist CTM.\n\nFodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s argument hinges on the distinction between\neliminative connectionism and implementationist\nconnectionism (cf. Pinker & Prince 1988). Eliminative\nconnectionists advance neural networks as a replacement for\nthe Turing-style formalism. They deny that mental computation consists\nin rule-governed symbol manipulation. Implementationist connectionists\nallow that, in some cases, mental computation may instantiate\nrule-governed symbol manipulation. They advance neural networks not to\nreplace classical computations but rather to model how classical\ncomputations are implemented in the brain. The hope is that, because\nneural network computation more closely resembles actual brain\nactivity, it can illuminate the physical realization of rule-governed\nsymbol manipulation.\n\nBuilding on Aydede\u2019s (2015) discussion, we may reconstruct Fodor\nand Pylyshyn\u2019s argument like so:\n\n Representational mental states and processes exist. An\nexplanatorily adequate account of cognition should acknowledge these\nstates and processes.\n The representational states and processes that figure in\nhigh-level cognition have certain fundamental properties: thought is\nproductive and systematic; inferential thinking is\nsystematic. The states and processes have these properties as\na matter of nomic necessity: it is a psychological law that\nthey have the properties.\n A theory of mental computation is explanatorily adequate only if\nit explains the nomic necessity of systematicity and\nproductivity.\n The only way to explain the nomic necessity of systematicity and\nproductivity is to postulate that high-level cognition instantiates\ncomputation over mental symbols with a compositional semantics.\nSpecifically, we must accept RTT+COMP.\n Either a connectionist theory endorses RTT+COMP or it does\nnot.\n If it does, then it is a version of implementationist\nconnectionism.\n If it does not, then it is a version of eliminative\nconnectionism. As per (iv), it does not explain productivity and\nsystematicity. As per (iii), it is not explanatorily adequate.\n Conclusion: Eliminative connectionist theories\nare not explanatorily adequate.\n\n\nThe argument does not say that neural networks are unable to\nmodel systematicity. One can certainly build a neural network that is\nsystematic. For example, one might build a neural network that can\nrepresent that John loves Mary only if it can represent that Mary\nloves John. The problem is that one might just as well build a neural\nnetwork that can represent that John loves Mary but cannot represent\nthat Mary loves John. Hence, nothing about the connectionist framework\nper se guarantees systematicity. For that reason, the\nframework does not explain the nomic necessity of systematicity. It\ndoes not explain why all the minds we find are systematic. In\ncontrast, the classical framework mandates systematicity, and so it\nexplains the nomic necessity of systematicity. The only apparent\nrecourse for connectionists is to adopt the classical explanation,\nthereby becoming implementationist rather than eliminative\nconnectionists.\n\nFodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s argument has spawned a massive literature,\nincluding too many rebuttals to survey here. The most popular\nresponses fall into five categories:\n\n Deny (i). Some connectionists deny that cognitive\nscience should posit representational mental states. They believe that\nmature scientific theorizing about the mind will delineate\nconnectionist models specified in non-representational terms (P.S.\nChurchland 1986; P.S. Churchland & Sejnowski 1989; P.M. Churchland\n1990; P.M. Churchland & P.S. Churchland 1990; Ramsey 2007). If so,\nthen Fodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s argument falters at its first step.\nThere is no need to explain why representational mental states are\nsystematic and productive if one rejects all talk about\nrepresentational mental states.\n Accept (viii). Some authors, such as Marcus (2001), feel\nthat neural networks are best deployed to illuminate the\nimplementation of Turing-style models, rather than as replacements for\nTuring-style models.\n Deny (ii). Some authors claim that Fodor and Pylyshyn\ngreatly exaggerate the extent to which thought is productive\n(Rumelhart & McClelland 1986) or systematic (Dennett 1991; Johnson\n2004). Horgan and Tienson (1996: 91\u201394) question the\nsystematicity of thinking. They contend that we deviate from norms of\ndeductive inference more than one would expect if we were following\nthe rigid mechanical rules postulated by CCTM.\n Deny (iv). Braddon-Mitchell and Fitzpatrick (1990) offer\nan evolutionary explanation for the systematicity of thought,\nbypassing any appeal to structured mental representations. In a\nsimilar vein, Horgan and Tienson (1996: 90) seek to explain\nsystematicity by emphasizing how our survival depends upon our ability\nto keep track of objects in the environment and their ever-changing\nproperties. Clark (1991) argues that systematicity follows from the\nholistic nature of thought ascription.\n Deny (vi). Chalmers (1990, 1993), Smolensky (1991), and\nvan Gelder (1991) claim that one can reject Turing-style models while\nstill postulating mental representations with compositionally and\ncomputationally relevant internal structure.\n\n\nWe focus here on (vi).\n\nAs discussed in\n section 1.2,\n Fodor elucidates constituency structure in terms of part/whole\nrelations. A complex representation\u2019s constituents are literal\nparts of it. One consequence is that, whenever the first\nrepresentation is tokened, so are its constituents. Fodor takes this\nconsequence to be definitive of classical computation. As Fodor and\nMcLaughlin (1990: 186) put it: \n\n\nfor a pair of expression types E1, E2, the first is a\nClassical constituent of the second only if the\nfirst is tokened whenever the second is tokened. \n\n\nThus, structured representations have a concatenative\nstructure: each token of a structured representation involves a\nconcatenation of tokens of the constituent representations.\nConnectionists who deny (vi) espouse a non-concatenative\nconception of constituency structure, according to which structure is\nencoded by a suitable distributed representation.\nDevelopments of the non-concatenative conception are usually quite\ntechnical (Elman 1989; Hinton 1990; Pollack 1990; Smolensky 1990,\n1991, 1995; Touretzky 1990). Most models use vector or\ntensor algebra to define operations over connectionist\nrepresentations, which are codified by activity vectors across nodes\nin a neural network. The representations are said to have\nimplicit constituency structure: the constituents are not\nliteral parts of the complex representation, but they can be extracted\nfrom the complex representation through suitable computational\noperations over it.\n\nFodor and McLaughlin (1990) grant that distributed representations may\nhave constituency structure \u201cin an extended sense\u201d. But\nthey insist that distributed representations are ill-suited to explain\nsystematicity. They focus especially on the systematicity of thinking,\nthe classical explanation for which postulates mechanical operations\nthat respond to constituency structure. Fodor and McLaughlin argue\nthat the non-concatenative conception cannot replicate the classical\nexplanation and offers no satisfactory substitute for it. Chalmers\n(1993) and Niklasson and van Gelder (1994) disagree. They contend that\na neural network can execute structure-sensitive computations over\nrepresentations that have non-concatenative constituency structure.\nThey conclude that connectionists can explain productivity and\nsystematicity without retreating to implementationist\nconnectionism.\n\nAydede (1995, 1997a) agrees that there is a legitimate notion of\nnon-concatenative constituency structure, but he questions whether the\nresulting models are non-classical. He denies that we should regard\nconcatenative structure as integral to LOTH. According to Aydede,\nconcatenative structure is just one possible physical realization of\nconstituency structure. Non-concatenative structure is another\npossible realization. We can accept RTT+COMP without glossing\nconstituency structure in concatenative terms. On this view, a neural\nnetwork whose operations are sensitive to non-concatenative\nconstituency structure may still count as broadly classical and in\nparticular as manipulating Mentalese expressions.\n\nThe debate between classical and connectionist CTM is still active,\nalthough not as active as during the 1990s. Recent anti-connectionist\narguments tend to have a more empirical flavor. For example, Gallistel\nand King (2009) defend CCTM by canvassing a range of non-human\nempirical case studies. According to Gallistel and King, the case\nstudies manifest a kind of productivity that CCTM can easily explain\nbut eliminative connectionism cannot.\n",
