    "main_text": "Forms and Arguments\n2. Forms and Arguments\n\nIn general, the term \u2018relativism\u2019 refers to many different\nideas. For example, in anthropology it sometimes connotes, among other\nthings, the rather uncontroversial notion that anthropologists should\nstrive to be impartial and unprejudiced in their empirical inquires.\nHowever, in moral philosophy \u2018relativism\u2019 is usually taken\nto suggest an empirical, a metaethical, or a normative position. The\nempirical position is usually:\n\nDescriptive Moral Relativism (DMR). As a matter of\nempirical fact, there are deep and widespread moral disagreements\nacross different societies, and these disagreements are much more\nsignificant than whatever agreements there may be.\n\n\nSometimes what is emphasized is moral diversity rather than strict\ndisagreement. DMR is often thought to have been established\nby anthropology and other empirical disciplines. However, it is not\nuncontroversial: Empirical as well as philosophical objections have\nbeen raised against it. Hence, it is one focal point of debate.\n\nThe metaethical position usually concerns the truth or justification\nof moral judgments, and it has been given somewhat different\ndefinitions. Metaethical relativists generally suppose that many\nfundamental moral disagreements cannot be rationally resolved, and on\nthis basis they argue that moral judgments lack the moral authority or\nnormative force that moral objectivists usually contend these\njudgments may have. Hence, metaethical relativism is in part a\nnegative thesis that challenges the claims of moral objectivists.\nHowever, it often involves a positive thesis as well, namely that\nmoral judgments nonetheless have moral authority or normative force,\nnot absolutely or universally (as objectivists contend), but relative\nto some group of persons such as a society or culture. This point is\ntypically made with respect to truth or justification (or both), and\nthe following definition will be a useful reference point:\n\nMetaethical Moral Relativism (MMR). The truth or\nfalsity of moral judgments, or their justification, is not absolute or\nuniversal, but is relative to the traditions, convictions, or\npractices of a group of persons.\n\n\nWith respect to truth-value, this means that a moral judgment such as\n\u2018Polygamy is morally wrong\u2019 may be true relative to one\nsociety, but false relative to another. It is not true, or false,\nsimply speaking. Likewise, with respect to justification, this\njudgment may be justified in one society, but not another. Taken in\none way, this last point is uncontroversial: The people in one society\nmay have different evidence available to them than the people in the\nother society. But proponents of MMR usually have something\nstronger and more provocative in mind: That the standards of\njustification in the two societies may differ from one another and\nthat there is no rational basis for resolving these differences. This\nis why the justification of moral judgments is relative rather than\nabsolute.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation of different\nformulations of relativism (for discussion of some of these, see\nFricker 2013, Krausz 2011 and L\u00f3pez de Sa 2011). It is\nimportant to note several distinctions that may be made in formulating\ndifferent metaethical relativist positions. First, a distinction is\nsometimes drawn between content relativism, the view that sentences\nmay have different contents (meanings) in different frameworks, and\ntruth relativism, the view that sentences have the same content in\ndifferent frameworks, but their truth-value may vary across these\nframeworks (for a discussion of this distinction in terms of moral\nrelativism, see Prinz 2007: 180\u20133). In the discussions that follow,\ntruth relativism is ordinarily assumed. Second, it is sometimes said\nthat the truth or justification of moral judgments may be relative to\nan individual person as well as a group of persons. In this article,\nthe latter will be assumed, as in the definition of MMR,\nunless otherwise noted. Third, that to which truth or justification is\nrelative may be the persons making the moral judgments or the persons\nabout whom the judgments are made. These are sometimes called\nappraiser and agent relativism respectively. Appraiser relativism\nsuggests that we do or should make moral judgments on the basis of our\nown standards, while agent relativism implies that the relevant\nstandards are those of the persons we are judging (of course, in some\ncases these may coincide). Appraiser relativism is the more common\nposition, and it will usually be assumed in the discussion that\nfollows. Finally, MMR may be offered as the best explanation\nof what people already believe, or it may be put forward as a position\npeople ought to accept regardless of what they now believe. There will\nbe occasion to discuss both claims below, though the latter is\nprobably the more common one.\n\nMetaethical moral relativist positions are typically contrasted with\nmoral objectivism. Let us say that moral objectivism maintains that\nmoral judgments are ordinarily true or false in an absolute or\nuniversal sense, that some of them are true, and that people sometimes\nare justified in accepting true moral judgments (and rejecting false\nones) on the basis of evidence available to any reasonable and\nwell-informed person. There are different ways of challenging moral\nobjectivism. Moral skepticism says that we are never justified in\naccepting or rejecting moral judgments. Other views\u2014variously\ncalled moral non-cognitivism, expressivism, anti-realism, nihilism,\netc.\u2014contend that moral judgments lack truth-value, at least\nbeyond the truth-value implied by the minimalist claim that to assert\nthat S is true is simply to assert S (a related view, the error\ntheory, claims that moral judgments are always false). MMR is\noften distinguished from all of these views: Instead of denying\ntruth-value or justification, it affirms relative forms of these.\nHowever, metaethical moral relativist views are sometimes regarded as\nconnected with positions that say moral judgments lack truth-value,\nsince the relativist views contend that moral judgments lack\ntruth-value in an absolute or universal sense. This is sometimes\nsimply a question of terminology, but not always. If it is said that\nmoral judgments lack truth-value (beyond the claim of minimalism),\nthen there cannot be relative truth-value in the sense that moral\nrelativists usually intend (though it might be contended that there is\na sense in which there could still be justification). As will be seen\nbelow, there is a debate about the relationship between MMR\nand non-cognitivist or expressivist positions.\n\nMost arguments for MMR are based on DMR and the\ncontention that it is implausible to suppose fundamental moral\ndisagreements can always be resolved rationally (for overviews of\nthese arguments, see Plakias 2020 and Seipel 2020b). Sometimes it is\nsaid that some moral disagreements are faultless, meaning that neither\nparty has made a mistake (see K\u00f6lbel 2004). For instance, Harman\n(1996), Prinz (2007) and Wong (1984 and 2006) have all stressed the\nimportance of moral disagreements in arguing for MMR, and\nsuch arguments will be considered in some detail in subsequent\nsections. However, some arguments for MMR have a rather\ndifferent approach, and two of these should be noted here.\n\nFirst, MMR might be defended as a consequence of the general\nrelativist thesis that the truth or justification of all\njudgments is not absolute or universal, but relative to some group of\npersons. For example, this general position might be maintained on the\nground that each society has its own conceptual framework and that\nconceptual frameworks are incommensurable with one another. Hence, we\ncan only speak of truth or justification in relative terms (see the\ndiscussion of incommensurability in the Summer 2015 archived version\nof the entry on\n relativism\n (section 4.2)). This position might be thought to have the\ndisadvantage that it can only be put forward as true or justified\nrelative to some conceptual framework (the suggestion is usually that\nthis framework is our own), and many find it implausible with regard\nto common sense judgments and judgments in the natural sciences.\nHowever, this is one avenue to MMR. But most proponents of\nMMR focus on distinctive features of morality and reject\ngeneral relativism. In fact, they often contrast morality and science\nwith respect to issues of truth and justification. For example, Harman\n(2000b), Prinz (2007) and Wong (1996 and 2006) all associate moral\nrelativism with naturalism, a position that usually presupposes the\nobjectivity of the natural sciences.\n\nSecond, a metaethical moral relativist position might be defended by\nemphasizing aspects of morality other than disagreement. For example,\nRovane (2011 and 2013) has maintained that relativism is best\nunderstood, not as a response to disagreement, but as a response to\nalternative conceptual schemes that portray different worlds that are\nnormatively insulated from one another. On this account, the\ntruth-bearers in one world are not logically related to the\ntruth-bearers in another world (so there cannot be strict\ndisagreement), and yet it is not possible to embrace both worlds (so\nthey are alternatives). Rovane argues that in the moral domain, but\nnot in the domain of the natural sciences, there may be different\nworlds in this sense. Hence, a moral judgment may be true for the\noccupant of one world, but not for the occupant of another. An\nimplication of this view, she says, is that learning and teaching\nacross different moral worlds might not be possible.\n\nIn a partially similar view, Velleman (2015) has claimed, on the basis\nof ethnographic and historical data, that different communities\nconstruct available action types differently. Moreover, reasons for\naction are always dependent on the perspective of the particular\ncommunity since they arise out of the drive for mutual\ninterpretability needed for social life within the community. Hence,\nthere are no perspective-independent reasons. There cannot be\nstraight-forward disagreement across these communities because they do\nnot have common sets of action types. The communities may nonetheless\naddress the basic themes of morality, but in incompatible ways given\ntheir different perspectives. So moralities can only have local\nvalidity.\n\nBoth Rovane and Velleman stress moral diversity rather than moral\ndisagreement. They maintain, not that disagreements cannot be\nrationally resolved, but that there is no basis for showing that,\namong various incompatible alternatives, one is rationally superior to\nanother.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting that MMR is sometimes\njustified by appealing in a significant way to a distinctive analysis\nof moral judgments in combination with a claim about moral\ndisagreement. For example, Prinz (2007) argues that what he calls\n\u201cmoral sentimentalism\u201d implies a form of MMR once\nwe acknowledge moral disagreements. According to moral sentimentalism,\nan action is morally right (wrong) if and only if some observer of the\naction has a sentiment of approbation (disapprobation) concerning it.\nPrinz defends this position on the basis of a metaethical argument\nthat it is the most plausible account in light of empirical studies\nlinking moral judgments and emotions. Since people often have\nconflicting sentiments about the same action, a judgment of the form\n\u2018Action X is right\u2019 may be true (when expressed\nby a person who approves of X), and \u2018X is\nwrong\u2019 may also be true (when expressed by a person who\ndisapproves of X). On this view, the truth of such moral\njudgments is relative to the sentiments of the persons who make them.\nMoral sentimentalism is a crucial feature of this argument and many\nphilosophers would deny that moral rightness and wrongness depend on\nour sentiments in this way. But most arguments for MMR are\nnot based on moral sentimentalism.\n\nIn another example, Harman (2000a) argues that a moral judgment that a\nperson ought to do X (an \u201cinner judgment\u201d)\nimplies that the person has motivating reasons to do X, and\nthat a person is likely to have such reasons only if he or she has\nimplicitly entered into an agreement with others about what to do.\nHence, moral judgments of this kind are valid only for groups of\npersons who have made such agreements. An action may be right relative\nto one agreement and wrong relative to another (this combines agent\nand appraisal relativism insofar as Harman assumes that the person\nmaking the judgment and the person to whom the judgment is addressed\nare both parties to the agreement).\n\nHarman\u2019s relativism is presented as a thesis about logical form,\nbut the relativist implication arises only because it is supposed that\nthe relevant motivating reasons are not universal and so probably\narose from an agreement that some but not all persons have made. In\nthis sense, moral disagreement is an important feature of the\nargument. But the main focus is on the internalist idea that inner\njudgments imply motivating reasons, reasons that are not provided\nsimply by being rational, but require particular desires or intentions\nthat a person may or may not have. Internalism in this sense is a\ncontroversial view, and many would say that a moral judgment can apply\nto a person whether or not that person is motivated to follow it (see\nthe section on \u2018Psychological: Moral Motivation\u2019 in the\nentry on\n moral epistemology).\n However, internalism is not a standard feature of most arguments for\nmoral relativism, and in fact some relativists are critical of\ninternalism (for example, see Wong 2006: ch. 7)\n\nIt is worth noting that internalism is one expression of a more\ngeneral viewpoint that emphasizes the action-guiding character of\nmoral judgments. Though Harman and others (for example, Dreier 1990\nand 2006) have argued that a form of moral relativism provides the\nbest explanation of internalism, a more common argument has been that\nthe action-guiding character of moral judgments is best explained by a\nnon-cognitivist or expressivist account according to which moral\njudgments lack truth-value (at least beyond the claim of minimalism).\nIn fact, some have claimed that the expressivist position avoids, and\nis superior to, moral relativism because it accounts for the\naction-guiding character of moral judgments without taking on the\nproblems that moral relativism is thought to involve (for instance,\nsee Blackburn 1998: ch. 9 and 1999, and Horgan and Timmons 2006). By\ncontrast, others have maintained that positions such as\nnon-cognitivism and expressivism are committed to a form of moral\nrelativism (for example, see Bloomfield 2003, Foot 2002b, and\nShafer-Landau 2003: ch 1). For an assessment of this debate, see\nMiller 2011, and for a discussion of non-cognitivism and related\npositions, see the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n\nFinally, the term \u2018moral relativism\u2019 is sometimes\nassociated with a normative position concerning how we ought to think\nabout, or behave towards, persons with whom we morally disagree.\nUsually the position is formulated in terms of tolerance. In\nparticular, it is said that we should not interfere with the actions\nof persons that are based on moral judgments we reject, when the\ndisagreement is not or cannot be rationally resolved. This is thought\nto apply especially to relationships between our society and those\nsocieties with which we have significant moral disagreements. Since\ntolerance so-understood is a normative thesis about what we morally\nought to do, it is best regarded, not as a form of moral relativism\nper se, but as a thesis that has often been thought to be\nimplied by relativist positions such as DMR and MMR.\nDespite the popularity of this thought, most philosophers believe it\nis mistaken. The main question is what philosophical relationship, if\nany, obtains between moral relativism and tolerance.\n\nThe remainder of this entry will discuss DMR, the contention\nthat it is unlikely that fundamental moral disagreements can be\nrationally resolved, arguments for and challenges to MMR,\nmixed positions that combine moral relativism and moral objectivism,\nand the relationship between moral relativism and tolerance. But first\nthere needs to be some consideration of the recent contributions of\nexperimental philosophy to these discussions.\n",
