    "main_text": "Physics\n3. Physics\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s treatment of the principles of physics\nprovides an illuminating example of his philosophical method. In his\nvarious summae he addresses the same set of issues treated in\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s physics, which are ultimately those already\naddressed by Aristotle\u2019s Physics. Thus we get\nconsiderations of body, motion, time, place, and void. Yet ideas from\nthe kal\u0101m tradition are brought into the mix too, and\nsometimes allowed to prevail. Thus he usually upholds the atomism\nshared by both the Mu\u02bftazilite and Ash\u02bfarite schools of\nkal\u0101m against the continuism of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. In\nother cases, Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to be following the lead of\nAb\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (who was himself an atomist), as he\nembraces a \u201cPlatonic\u201d understanding of time and place,\naccording to which these are independent principles rather than\nmeasurements and limits of bodies and their motions.\n\nThe fundamental distinction in kal\u0101m physics is that\nbetween the atomic substance (jawhar) or \u201cindivisible\npart\u201d, on the one hand, and the accidental properties\n(a\u02bfr\u0101\u1e0d) that belong to these atoms, on the\nother hand (Dhanani 1994, Sabra 2006). As far back as the initial\nreception of Greek philosophy into Arabic, fal\u0101sifa like\nal-Kind\u012b (in a lost work) had rejected atomism in favor of\nAristotelian continuism. This is the view that every part of every\nbody, no matter how small, can in principle be divided into yet\nsmaller sub-parts. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was also a strong opponent of\natomism (Lettinck 1988, McGinnis 2013, Dhanani 2015), and his\narguments provoked discussion in a number of twelfth century authors\n(see, e.g., McGinnis 2019). Fakhr al-D\u012bn is thus joining a\nlong-running debate when he addresses the cogency of atomism. His\nstatements on the question present a typically confusing picture. He\nseems to reject atomism in his \u201cphilosophical\u201d\n(falsaf\u012b, \u1e25ikm\u012b) works, only to\naccept it in his kal\u0101m works (Zark\u0101n 1963:\n67\u201398). However his late summa, the\nMa\u1e6d\u0101lib, may show that he came to embrace\nkal\u0101m atomism as his own considered view (Dhanani 2015;\nsee also Setia 2004 and 2006, and Baffioni 1982: 211\u201375; for his\nopposition to hylomorphism see Ibrahim 2020).\n\nAs a decisive consideration in favor of atomism he here states that,\nif continuism were true, each body would have an infinity of parts, so\nthat a mustard seed could be \u201cstretched\u201d to coincide with\nthe whole universe (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.6, 71; see Dhanani\n2015: 102 for the passage). Another atomist argument is that if a true\nsphere were to meet a true surface, it would make contact at an\nindivisible point. We can further argue as follows:\n\n\nOnce it is established that the locus of contact is something\nindivisible, the existence of the individual atom must be\nacknowledged. For if we roll a sphere in a full circle on a plane\nsurface, there can be no doubt that as soon as one point of contact\nceases, contact is established with another\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.6, 48\u20139).\n\n\nAs this argument shows, the atoms under consideration here are akin to\ngeometrical points, rather than the very small, extended but\nindivisible bodies proposed in ancient Greek atomism and by the\nearlier Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b. This itself an inheritance\nfrom the kal\u0101m tradition. Geometry was also used by some\nto rebut atomism, so in both the Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib and a\nseparate treatise dedicated to this issue (Alta\u015f 2015), Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn sets out geometrical arguments against atomism and offers\ncounter-refutations.\n\nIf he is indeed an atomist, it would make sense that he should believe\nin the possibility of void, since in both classical and\nkal\u0101m atomism these two doctrines are usually found\ntogether. Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b and Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\nal-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were also proponents of the void, and both were\ninfluential figures for Fakhr al-D\u012bn. On this topic, he seems to\nbe fairly consistent in upholding the possibility of void against\nAristotelian and Avicennan arguments for its impossibility (Adamson\n2018a). For example, he rejects the Aristotelian argument that, if the\nspeed of motion is inversely proportional to the density of the\nmedium, then motion in a void would be infinitely fast:\n\n\nIf we assume that part of the [required] time is to accommodate the\nmotion in itself, and part of it to accommodate the hindrance, then\nthe motion in pure void will take place in that amount of time that is\nappropriate to the motion as it is in itself. Motion occurring in a\nplenum, meanwhile, will occur in that amount of time plus a further\namount of time, as rendered appropriate by whatever is in the interval\nthat offers [175] hindrance. So it is established that the conclusion\nthey sought to force [on the proponent of void, sc. that motion in a\nvoid would be infinitely fast given the total lack of resistance] does\nnot follow (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.5,\n174.19\u2013175.1).\n\n\nIn other words, the density of the medium only slows the intrinsic\nspeed of the motion that it would have in a vaccuum, which is\nfinite.\n\nVoid is defined either as a case in which two bodies fail to be in\ncontact, with no body between them (Arba\u02bf\u012bn vol.2,\n32) or as a space that has nothing placed within it\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.5, 155). Physical arguments provide\nevidence that void is in fact not just possible but actually occurs,\nas when two flat surfaces are pulled apart: it will take some time,\nhowever minimal, until air rushes in to fill the empty space\n(Arba\u02bf\u012bn vol.2, 35). The second definition of void\njust mentioned brings us to Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s notion of space\nor place, and already suggests his view that place is not dependent on\nbodies, as Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 had claimed (Adamson 2017). For Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, following Aristotle, place is the inner boundary of a\ncontaining body, for example the interior surface of a jug that\nsurrounds the water placed in the jug (Lammer 2018: \u00a75.3). Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn subjects this conception to a barrage of criticisms, for\nexample that a jewel inside a bag would remain in the same\n\u201cplace\u201d even as it is being transported between cities\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.5, 147). Instead, place is for him\nindeed \u201cspace\u201d (fa\u1e0d\u0101\u02be,\n\u1e25ayyiz), which is independent of bodies and may be\neither occupied by a body or not.\n\nWe find a parallel between this idea about space and his account of\ntime (Setia 2008, Adamson 2018b, Adamson & Lammer 2020). For Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 time is a measure of motion (\u02bfAbd\nal-Muta\u02bf\u0101l 2003, McGinnis 2003 and 2008). In the first\ninstance it is the measure of the motion of the outermost heaven,\nsince this is the fastest motion in the cosmos, which accounts for the\napparent diurnal rotation of the fixed stars around the Earth. This,\nfor Fakhr al-D\u012bn, is the \u201cperipatetic\u201d account of\ntime. In his Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib he refutes it and also a\nvariant of the view found in Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t, according to\nwhich time is the measure of existence rather than motion.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn does at least agree that time is real. To establish\nthis he cites an old kal\u0101m idea that time offers a\ncoordination between independent events (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith\nvol.1, 761; Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.5, 47), which is why it is\npossible for me to arrange to meet with you tomorrow (one event) when\nthe sun rises (another event). But time\u2019s existence is not\nsupervenient on motions or cases of existence. Were that the case,\nthen we would have multiple, simultaneous times for the various\nmotions, which would need a superordinate time to coordinate them.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s discussions of time give us a nice example\nof how his views developed, even while circling around the same set of\narguments (Adamson & Lammer 2020). In the\nMab\u0101\u1e25ith he expresses an an agnostic point of\nview:\n\n\nI have not yet arrived at the realization of the truth about time, so\nlet your expectation from this book be a thorough examination and\nreport of whatever can possibly be said [about time] from all points\nof view (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith vol.1, 761).\n\n\nWhen he writes the Mulakhkha\u1e63, by contrast, he is\ncoming around to the view that beforeness and afterness are\n\u201citems of consideration\u201d (um\u016br\ni\u02bftib\u0101riyya). Yet at the end of his career, he has\nadopted the contrary view. Now he endorses what he says is\nPlato\u2019s view of time: it is \u201ca substance subsisting in\nitself and independent in itself\u201d (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib\nvol.6, 76). The allusion to Plato presumably refers to the\nTimaeus. He is apparently following his fellow philosopher of\nRayy, Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b, both in accepting the\nindependence of time and place and in seeing Plato as an authority for\nthat physical theory (Adamson 2021a: ch.5). One difference between the\ntwo R\u0101z\u012bs, however, is that Fakhr al-D\u012bn makes it clear\nthat time and place are both created by God, and not\n\u201ceternal\u201d principles. Thus his overall account of physics\nenvisions a created spatio-temporal framework within which bodies may,\nbut need not, exist.\n",
