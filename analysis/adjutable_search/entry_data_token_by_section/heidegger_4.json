Of course, if authentic Dasein were\nindividualized in the sense of being a self-sufficient Cartesian\nsubject, then perhaps an extreme form of subjectivist relativism would\nindeed beckon. Fortunately, however, authentic Dasein isn't a\nCartesian subject, in part because it has a transformed and not a\nsevered relationship with the \u2018they\u2019. This reconnects us\nwith our earlier remark that the philosophical framework advocated\nwithin Being and Time appears to mandate a kind of\ncultural relativism. This seems right, but it is important to\ntry to understand precisely what sort of cultural relativism is on\noffer. Here is one interpretation.\n\n\nAlthough worlds (networks of involvements, what Heidegger sometimes\ncalls Reality) are culturally relative phenomena, Heidegger\noccasionally seems to suggest that nature, as it is in itself,\nis not. Thus, on the one hand, nature may be discovered as\nready-to-hand equipment: the \u201cwood is a forest of timber, the\nmountain is a quarry of rock; the river is water-power, the wind is\nwind \u2018in the sails\u2019\u2009\u201d (Being and Time 15:\n100). Under these circumstances, nature is revealed in certain\nculturally specific forms determined by our socially conditioned\npatterns of skilled practical activity. On the other hand, when nature\nis discovered as present-at-hand, by say science, its intelligibility\nhas an essentially cross-cultural character. Indeed, Heidegger often\nseems to hold the largely commonsense view that there are\nculture-independent causal properties of nature which explain why it is\nthat you can make missiles out of rocks or branches, but not out of air\nor water. Science can tell us both what those causal properties are,\nand how the underlying causal processes work. Such properties and\nprocesses are what Heidegger calls the Real, and he comments:\n\u201c[the] fact that Reality [intelligibility] is ontologically\ngrounded in the Being of Dasein does not signify that only when Dasein\nexists and as long as Dasein exists can the Real [e.g., nature as\nrevealed by science] be as that which in itself it is\u201d\n(Being and Time, 43: 255). \n\n\nIf the picture just sketched is a productive way to understand\nHeidegger, then, perhaps surprisingly, his position might best be\nthought of as a mild kind of scientific realism. For, on this\ninterpretation, one of Dasein's cultural practices, the practice\nof science, has the special quality of revealing natural entities as\nthey are in themselves, that is, independently of Dasein's\nculturally conditioned uses and articulations of them. Crucially,\nhowever, this sort of scientific realism maintains ample conceptual\nroom for Sheehan's well-observed point that, for Heidegger, at\nevery stage of his thinking, \u201cthere is no \u2018is\u2019 to\nthings without a taking-as\u2026 no sense that is independent of\nhuman being\u2026 Before homo sapiens evolved, there was no\n\u2018being\u2019 on earth\u2026 because \u2018being\u2019 for\nHeidegger does not mean \u2018in existence\u2019\u2009\u201d (Sheehan\n2001). Indeed, Being concerns sense-making (intelligibility), and the\ndifferent ways in which entities make sense to us, including as\npresent-at-hand, are dependent on the fact that we are Dasein,\ncreatures with a particular mode of Being. So while natural entities do\nnot require the existence of Dasein in order just to occur (in an\nordinary, straightforward sense of \u2018occur\u2019), they do\nrequire Dasein in order to be intelligible at all, including\nas entities that just occur. Understood properly, then, the\nfollowing two claims that Heidegger makes are entirely consistent with\neach other. First: \u201cBeing (not entities) is dependent upon the\nunderstanding of Being; that is to say, Reality (not the Real) is\ndependent upon care\u201d. Secondly: \u201c[O]nly as long as Dasein\nis (that is, only as long as an understanding of Being is ontically\npossible), \u2018is there\u2019 Being. When Dasein does not exist,\n\u2018independence\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 not either, nor\n\u2018is\u2019 the \u2018in-itself\u2019\u2009\u201d. (Both quotations\nfrom Being and Time, 43: 255.)\n\n\nHow does all this relate to Heidegger's account of truth?\nAnswering this question adds a new dimension to the pivotal phenomenon\nof revealing. Heidegger points out that the philosophical tradition\nstandardly conceives of truth as attaching to propositions, and as\ninvolving some sort of correspondence between propositions and states\nof affairs. But whereas for the tradition (as Heidegger characterizes\nit), propositional truth as correspondence exhausts the phenomenon of\ntruth, for Heidegger, it is merely the particular manifestation of\ntruth that is operative in those domains, such as science, that concern\nthemselves with the Real. According to Heidegger, propositional truth\nas correspondence is made possible by a more fundamental phenomenon\nthat he dubs \u2018original truth\u2019. Heidegger's key\nthought here is that before (in a conceptual sense of\n\u2018before\u2019) there can be any question of correspondence\nbetween propositions and states of affairs, there needs to be in place\na field of intelligibility (Reality, a world), a sense-making structure\nwithin which entities may be found. Unconcealing is the\nDasein-involving process that establishes this prior field of\nintelligibility. This is the domain of original truth\u2014what we\nmight call truth as revealing or truth as\nunconcealing. Original truth cannot be reduced to propositional\ntruth as correspondence, because the former is an a priori,\ntranscendental condition for the latter. Of course, since Dasein is the\nsource of intelligibility, truth as unconcealing is possible only\nbecause there is Dasein, which means that without Dasein there would be\nno truth\u2014including propositional truth as correspondence. But\nit is reasonable to hear this seemingly relativistic consequence as a\nfurther modulation of the point (see above) that entities require\nDasein in order to be intelligible at all, including, now, as entities\nthat are capable of entering into states of affairs that may correspond\nto propositions.\n\n\nHeidegger's analysis of truth also countenances a third\nmanifestation of the phenomenon, one that is perhaps best characterized\nas being located between original truth and propositional\ntruth. This intermediate phenomenon is what might be called\nHeidegger's instrumental notion of truth (Dahlstrom\n2001, Overgaard 2002). As we saw earlier, for Heidegger, the\nreferential structure of significance may be articulated not only by\nwords but by skilled practical activity (e.g., hammering) in which items\nof equipment are used in culturally appropriate ways. By\nHeidegger's lights, such equipmental activity counts as a\nmanifestation of unconcealing and thus as the realization of a species\nof truth. This fact further threatens the idea that truth attaches only\nto propositions, although some uses of language may themselves be\nanalysed as realizing the instrumental form of truth (e.g., when I\nexclaim that \u2018this hammer is too heavy for the job\u2019, rather\nthan assert that it has the objective property of weighing 2.5 kilos;\nOvergaard 2002, 77; cf. Being and Time 33:199\u2013200).\n\n\nIt is at this point that an ongoing dispute in Heidegger scholarship\ncomes to the fore. It has been argued (e.g., Dahlstrom 2001, Overgaard\n2002) that a number of prominent readings of Heidegger (e.g., Okrent\n1988, Dreyfus 1991) place such heavy philosophical emphasis on Dasein\nas a site of skilled practical activity that they end up simply\nidentifying Dasein's understanding of Being with skilled\npractical activity. Because of this shared tendency, such readings are\noften grouped together as advocating a pragmatist\ninterpretation of Heidegger. According to its critics, the inadequacy\nof the pragmatist interpretation is exposed once it is applied to\nHeidegger's account of truth. For although the pragmatist\ninterpretation correctly recognizes that, for Heidegger, propositional\ncorrespondence is not the most fundamental phenomenon of truth, it\ntakes the fundamental variety to be exhausted by Dasein's\nsense-making skilled practical activity. But (the critic points out)\nthis is to ignore the fact that even though instrumental truth is more\nbasic than traditional propositional truth, nevertheless it too depends\non a prior field of significance (one that determines the correct and\nincorrect uses of equipment) and thus on the phenomenon of original\ntruth. Put another way, the pragmatist interpretation falls short\nbecause it fails to distinguish original truth from instrumental truth.\nIt is worth commenting here that not every so-called pragmatist reading\nis on a par with respect to this issue. For example, Dreyfus (2008)\nseparates out (what he calls) background coping\n(Dasein's familiarity with, and knowledge of how to navigate the meaningful structures of,\nits world) from (what he calls) skilled or absorbed\ncoping (Dasein's skilled practical activity), and argues that,\nfor Heidegger, the former is ontologically more basic than the latter.\nIf original truth is manifested in background coping, and instrumental\ntruth in skilled coping, this disrupts the thought that the two notions\nof truth are being run together (for discussion, see Overgaard 2002\n85\u20136, note 17).\n\n\nHow should one respond to Heidegger's analysis of truth?\nOne objection is that original truth ultimately fails to qualify as a\nform of truth at all. As Tugendhat (1967) observes, it is a plausible\ncondition on the acceptability of any proposed account of truth that it\naccommodate a distinction between what is asserted or intended and how\nthings are in themselves. It is clear that propositional truth as\ncorrespondence satisfies this condition, and notice that (if we squint\na little) so too does instrumental truth, since despite my intentions,\nI can fail, in my actions, to use the hammer in ways that successfully\narticulate its place in the relevant equipmental network. However, as\nTugendhat argues, it is genuinely hard to see how original truth as\nunconcealing could possibly support a distinction between what is\nasserted or intended and how things are in themselves. After all,\nunconcealing is, in part, the process through which entities are made\nintelligible to Dasein in such a way that the distinction in question\ncan apply. Thus, Tugendhat concludes, although unconcealing may be a\ngenuine phenomenon that constitutes a transcendental condition for\nthere to be truth, it is not itself a species of truth. (For\ndiscussions of Tugendhat's critique, see Dahlstrom 2001,\nOvergaard 2002.)\n\n\nWhether or not unconcealing ought to count as a species of truth,\nit is arguable that the place which it (along with its partner\nstructure, Reality) occupies in the Heideggerian framework must\nultimately threaten even the mild kind of scientific realism that we\nhave been attributing, somewhat tentatively, to Heidegger. The tension\ncomes into view just at the point where unconcealing is reinterpreted\nin terms of Dasein's essential historicality. Because\nintelligibility, and thus unconcealing, has an essentially historical\ncharacter, it is difficult to resist the thought that the propositional\nand instrumental truths generated out of some specific field of\nintelligibility will be relativistically tied to a particular culture\nin a particular time period. Moreover, at one point, Heidegger suggests\nthat even truth as revealed by science is itself subject to this kind\nof relativistic constraint. Thus he says that \u201cevery factical\nscience is always manifestly in the grip of historizing\u201d\n(Being and Time 76: 444). The implication is that, for\nHeidegger, one cannot straightforwardly subject the truth of one age to\nthe standards of another, which means, for example, that contemporary\nchemistry and alchemical chemistry might both be true (cf. Dreyfus\n1990, 261\u20132). But even if this more radical position is ultimately\nHeidegger's, there remains space here for some form of realism.\nGiven the transcendental relation that, according to Heidegger, obtains\nbetween fields of intelligibility and science, the view on offer might\nstill support a historically conditioned form of Kantian empirical\nrealism with respect to science. Nevertheless it must, it seems, reject\nthe full-on scientific realist commitment to the idea that the history\nof science is regulated by progress towards some final and unassailable\nset of scientifically established truths about nature, by a journey\ntowards, as it were, God's science (Haugeland 2007).\nThe realist waters in which our preliminary interpretation has been\nswimming are muddied even further by another aspect of Dasein's\nessential historicality. Officially, it is seemingly not supposed to be\na consequence of that historicality that we cannot discover universal\nfeatures of ourselves. The evidence for this is that there are many\nconclusions reached in Being and Time that putatively apply to\nall Dasein, for example that Dasein's everyday experience is\ncharacterized by the structural domains of readiness-to-hand,\nun-readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand (for additional evidence, see\nPolt 1999 92\u20134). Moreover, Heidegger isn't saying that any route\nto understanding is as good as any other. For example, he prioritizes\nauthenticity as the road to an answer to the question of the meaning of\nBeing. Thus:\n\nthe idea of existence, which guides us as that\nwhich we see in advance, has been made definite [transformed from\npre-ontological to ontological, from implicit and vague to explicitly\narticulated] by the clarification of our ownmost\npotentiality-for-Being. (Being and Time 63: 358)\n\n\n Still,\nif this priority claim and the features shared by all Dasein really are\nsupposed to be ahistorical, universal conditions (applicable everywhere\nthroughout history), we are seemingly owed an account of just how such\nconditions are even possible, given Dasein's essential\nhistoricality.\n\n\nFinally, one might wonder whether the \u2018realist\nHeidegger\u2019 can live with the account of temporality given in\nBeing and Time. If temporality is the a priori condition for\nus to encounter entities as equipment, and if, in the relevant sense,\nthe unfolding of time coincides with the unfolding of Dasein (Dasein,\nas temporality, temporalizes; see above), then equipmental entities\nwill be intelligible to us only in (what we might call) Dasein-time,\nthe time that we ourselves are. Now, we have seen previously that\nnature is often encountered as equipment, which means that natural\nequipment will be intelligible to us only in Dasein-time. But what\nabout nature in a non-equipmental form\u2014nature (as one might\nsurely be tempted to say) as it is in itself? One might try to argue\nthat those encounters with nature that reveal nature as it is in itself\nare precisely those encounters that reveal nature as present-at-hand,\nand that to reveal nature as present-at-hand is, in part, to reveal\nnature within present-at-hand time (e.g., clock time), a time which is,\nin the relevant sense, independent of Dasein. Unfortunately\nthere's a snag with this story (and thus for the attempt to see\nHeidegger as a realist). Heidegger claims that presence-at-hand (as\nrevealed by theoretical reflection) is subject to the same\nDasein-dependent temporality as readiness-to-hand: \n\n\n\u2026if\nDasein's Being is completely grounded in temporality, then\ntemporality must make possible Being-in-the-world and therewith\nDasein's transcendence; this transcendence in turn provides the\nsupport for concernful Being alongside entities within-the-world,\nwhether this Being is theoretical or practical.\n(Being and Time 69: 415, my emphasis)\n\n\n But now if theoretical\ninvestigations reveal nature in present-at-hand time, and if in the\nswitching over from the practical use of equipment to the theoretical\ninvestigation of objects, time remains the same Dasein-time, then\npresent-at-hand time is Dasein-dependent too. Given this, it seems that\nthe only way we can give any sense to the idea of nature as it is in\nitself is to conceive of such nature as being outside of time.\nInterestingly, in the History of the Concept of Time (a text\nbased on Heidegger's notes for a 1925 lecture course and often\nthought of as a draft of Being and Time), Heidegger seems to\nembrace this very option, arguing that nature is within time only when\nit is encountered in Dasein's world, and concluding that nature\nas it is in itself is entirely atemporal. It is worth noting the\nsomewhat Kantian implication of this conclusion: if all understanding\nis grounded in temporality, then the atemporality of nature as it is in\nitself would mean that, for Heidegger, we cannot understand natural\nthings as they really are in themselves (cf. Dostal 1993).\n",
