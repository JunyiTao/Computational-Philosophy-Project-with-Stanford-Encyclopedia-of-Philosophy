    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Spurious Fragments and Testimonia\n1.4 Spurious Fragments and Testimonia\n\nThere are 15 fragments which are generally believed to be spurious (8,\n8a, 9\u201312, 14, 15, 19, 20a, 20b, 20c, 21\u2013 23) and six\ntestimonia (11\u201313, 16b, 17b, 30) that are based on spurious\nworks (Huffman 1993, 341\u2013420). In two instances we are given\ntitles for the spurious works from which the fragments come. Fragment\n21 is said to come from On the Soul and Fr. 22 from On\nRhythms and Measures. There are two problematic references to a\nwork entitled Bacchae. Stobaeus cites Frs. 17 and 18 as\ncoming from this work. Fr. 18, which dealt with the sun, was lost in\nthe transmission of Stobaeus, but Fr. 17 is generally accepted as\nauthentic on the basis of its contents and on those grounds would\nappear to come from On Nature. This might suggest that\nBacchae was an alternative title for On Nature\n(Burkert 1972a, 269). On the other hand, Proclus describes the\nBacchae as teaching theology by means of mathematics (DK 44\nB19; Huffman 1993, 417\u20138), which is not a very apt description\nof the central surviving fragments of On Nature, but would\nfit the astrological material of controversial authenticity, which is\ncited elsewhere by Proclus (A14\u2014see 1.3 above). Thus it may be\nthat Bacchae is the title of a spurious work and that Fr. 17\nwas mistakenly assigned to that work. Kingsley argues that the title\nis genuine and one of several pieces of evidence for a connection\nbetween the Pythagoreans and Bacchic mysteries (1995: 262).\nStamatellos (2007: 102\u2013103) suggests that Fragments 21 and 23\nare authentic, but the overwhelming consensus of other scholars\nregards them as spurious (see Burkert 1972: 242\u2013243, who refers\nto previous scholarship and Huffman 1993: 343\u2013344). Mansfeld\n(2016) suggests a quite plausible emendation to Fr. 12 but still\nregards it as spurious. McKirahan (2016) argues that B14 is genuine,\nbut Philolaus\u2019 use of psyche in the genuine B13 is\nincompatible with its use in B14.\n",
