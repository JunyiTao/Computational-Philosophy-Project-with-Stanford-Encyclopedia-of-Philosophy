    "main_text": "Mysterianism || Negative Mysterianism\n4.1 Negative Mysterianism\n\nThe negative mysterian holds that the true doctrine of the Trinity is\nnot understandable because it is too poor in intelligible content for\nit to positively seem either consistent or inconsistent to us. In the\nlate fourth-century pro-Nicene consensus this takes the form of\nrefusing to state in literal language what there are three of in God,\nhow they\u2019re related to God or to the divine essence, and how\nthey\u2019re related to each other. (See\n section 3.3\n in the supplementary document on the history of Trinity theories.)\nThe Persons of the Trinity, in this way of thinking, are somewhat like\nthree men, but also somewhat like a mind, its thought, and its will,\nand also somewhat like a root, a tree, and a branch. Multiple\nincongruous analogies are given, the idea being that a minimal content\nof the doctrine is thereby expressed, though we remain unable to\nconvert the non-literal claims to literal ones, and may even be unable\nto express in what respects the analogies do and don\u2019t fit.\nNegative mysterianism goes hand in hand with the doctrines of divine\nincomprehensibility (that God or God\u2019s essence can\u2019t be\nunderstood completely, at all, or adequately) and divine ineffability\n(that no human concept, or at least none of some subset of these,\napplies literally to God). Some recent studies have emphasized the\ncentrality of negative mysterianism to the pro-Nicene tradition of\ntrinitarian thought, chastising recent theorists who seem to feel\nunconstrained by it (Ayres 2004; Coakley 1999; Dixon 2003).\n\nThe practical upshot of this is being content to merely repeat the\napproved trinitarian sentences. Thus, after considering and rejecting\nas inadequate multiple analogies for the Trinity, Gregory of Nazianzus\nconcludes,\n\nSo, in the end, I resolved that it was best to say\n\u201cgoodbye\u201d to images and shadows, deceptive and utterly\ninadequate as they are to express that reality. I resolved to keep\nclose to the more truly religious view and rest content with some few\nwords, taking the Spirit as my guide and, in his company and in\npartnership with him, safeguarding to the end the genuine illumination\nI had received from him, as I strike out a path through this world. To\nthe best of my powers I will persuade all men to worship Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit as the single Godhead and power, because to him belong\nall glory, honor, and might forever and ever. Amen. (Nazianzus,\nOration 31, 143.)\n\n\nOpponents of this sort of mysterianism object to it as misdirection,\nspecial pleading, neglect of common sense, or even deliberate\nobfuscation. They emphasize that trinitarian theories are human\nconstructs, and a desideratum of any theory is clarity. We literally\ncan\u2019t believe what is expressed in trinitarian language, if we\ndon\u2019t grasp the meaning of it, and to the extent that we\ndon\u2019t understand a doctrine, it can\u2019t guide our other\ntheological beliefs, our actions, or our worship (Cartwright 1987;\nDixon 2003, 125\u201331; Nye 1691b, 47; Tuggy 2003a, 176\u201380).\nNegative mysterians reply that it is well-grounded in tradition, and\nthat those who are not naively overconfident in human reason expect\nsome unclarity in the content of this\u00a0doctrine.\n",
