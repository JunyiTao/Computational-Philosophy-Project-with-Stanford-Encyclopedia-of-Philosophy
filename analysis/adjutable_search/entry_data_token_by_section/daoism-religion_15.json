    "main_text": "Main Schools and Lineages || Quanzhen\n3.7 Quanzhen (Complete Reality, or Complete Perfection)\n\nIn 1127, the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) captured Kaifeng,\nand the Song dynasty was obliged to move its capital to Hangzhou,\nestablishing the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279). It was under\nthe Jin rule that Quanzhen (Complete Reality, or Complete Perfection)\nwas created (Yao 2000; Goossaert 2001; Marsone 2010). This monastic\norder is, with the Way of the Celestial Masters, the main branch of\npresent-day Daoism.\n\nQuanzhen was founded by Wang Zhe (1113\u201370), who was active as a\npreacher in Shandong in the late 1160s, and by his seven main\ndisciples, among whom Ma Yu, Sun Bu\u2019er (the latter\u2019s\nwife), and Qiu Chuji deserve mention. Five \u201clay\nassociations\u201d were established to support the teaching, which\nspread rapidly. Controversies with Buddhism led to proscriptions in\nthe second half of the 13th century, which included the\nburning of a Daoist Canon recently compiled by Quanzhen\nrepresentatives. Quanzhen, however, maintained a strong local\npresence, and after the reunification of China under the Yuan dynasty\nit obtained again the favor of the court. While the Ming dynasty\n(1368\u20131644) gave priority to the Celestial Masters, Wang\nChangyue (1592\u20131680) gained the support of the newly-established\nManchu Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912). Since then, his\nLongmen (Dragon Gate) lineage has been the main branch of\nQuanzhen (Esposito 2004). In the present day, Wang Changyue\u2019s temple, the Baiyun\nGuan (Abbey of the White Cloud) in Beijing, is the\nseat of the China Daoist Association (Zhongguo daojiao xiehui).\n\nUnlike Tianshi dao, whose priests are married and live with their\nfamilies, Quanzhen is a celibate monastic order, and under this form\nit has propagated mainly in northern China. In addition to certain\nforms of ritual, the main practices of Quanzhen monks include\nmeditation and Internal Alchemy (Eskildson 2004). However, the overall\nimage of Quanzhen (and Longmen) is complex, as it also includes\nnon-institutional and non-monastic forms. At their origins lies the\nfact that Wang Zhe and his seven disciples are also identified as the\nso-called Beizong, or Northern Lineage, of Neidan; and especially the\nfact that Longmen as a whole traces its origins to the above-mentioned\nQiu Chuji, who is traditionally known as a Neidan practitioner. From\nthe Yuan period onwards, therefore, several masters and adepts of\nNeidan have claimed affiliation to Quanzhen and/or Longmen, and have\ncreated innumerable sub-lineages throughout China with little or no\nconnection to the central institution.\n",
