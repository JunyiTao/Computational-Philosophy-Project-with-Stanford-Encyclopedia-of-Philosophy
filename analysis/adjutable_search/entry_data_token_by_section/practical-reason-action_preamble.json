    "main_text": "\n\nA wave of recent philosophical work on practical rationality is\norganized by the following implicit argument: Practical reasoning is\nfiguring out what to do; to do is to act; so the forms of practical\ninference can be derived from the structure or features of action. Now\nit is not as though earlier work in analytic philosophy had failed to\nregister the connection between action and practical rationality; in\nfact, practical reasoning was usually picked out as, roughly,\nreasoning directed toward action. But for much of the twentieth\ncentury, attention moved quickly away from this initial delineation of\nthe subject area, to the interplay of beliefs and desires within the\nmind (instrumentalist theories, including their Davidsonian and\nWilliamsian variants), or to procedures for checking that a plan of\naction was supported by sufficient yet consistent reasons (Kantian\ntheories), or to the ultra-refined sensibilities of the practically\nintelligent reasoner (Aristotelian theories). The hallmark of the\nemerging family of treatments to be surveyed here is, first, the\nsustained attention paid to answering the question, \u201cWhat does\nit take to be an action (at all)?\u201d, and second, the use made of\na distinction between full-fledged action and its lesser relatives;\ncharacterizations and terminology vary, but often the less robust\nalternative is called \u201cmere activity\u201d or \u201cmere\nbehavior\u201d. Very schematically, these arguments for a theory of\npractical reasoning try to show that reasons brought to bear on choice\nmust have some particular logical form, if action is not to lapse into\nsomething less than that.\n\nThe current state of the dialectic is evidently transitional, because\nwork of this sort for the most part does not yet speak to other work\nof the same kind. (Recent exceptions are marked below, and it does\nspeak to earlier but differently focused work in the field.) Despite\ntheir shared agreement that practical reasoning is where the action\nis, and the consequent willingness to accord explanatory priority to\naction theory in developing theories of practical rationality, these\ntheorists differ among themselves as to what the most central features\nof actions are, and accordingly they disagree about what the\nlegitimate patterns of practical inference turn out to be. They also\ndiffer in their underlying philosophical motivations, as well as in\nwhat they take to be the upshots of their views for substantive moral\ntheory. For that reason, the considerations in play do not have the\nsort of mutual coherence and organization characteristic of the\ndiscussion of some of the more settled philosophical problem\nspaces.\n\nThe purpose of this overview is to provide a map of this territory,\nand because interchanges between the theorists in it are infrequent,\nthis is primarily going to mean describing the disparate research\nprograms that have adopted its framing argument. Because the priority\nis to highlight both their common ground, and the ways in which these\nprograms nonetheless talk past one another, this article will not\npress a number of problems internal to the several research programs.\nIf you notice some obvious but unaddressed objection to some line of\ninquiry, don\u2019t assume you\u2019re making a mistake, but don\u2019t let it\nsidetrack you.\n\nThe features of action that have come in for the most attention are,\nfirst, its calculative structure, second, its attributability, third,\nits aspiration to be challenging and ambitious, fourth, its role in\nsocial practice, and fifth, its evaluative features, and they will be\ndiscussed in that order. That will permit us to conclude with remarks\nabout the prospects and agenda of this approach to practical\ndeliberation.\n",
