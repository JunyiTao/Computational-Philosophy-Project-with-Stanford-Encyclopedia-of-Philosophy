    "main_text": "The Text of the Book of Changes || Rituals\n1.4 Rituals\n\nIf one just reads the Shuogua and the Xugua,\ndivination does not seem to have a role in decision making. However,\nin the Xici, divination plays an important role in helping\ninquirers to make critical decisions. In fact, an extended passage is\ndevoted to discussing how to perform divination with 50 yarrow stalks\n(Xici I: 8, more about it later). In addition, the\nXici authors identify divination as one of four ways to use\nthe hexagrams: (1) to use the hexagram statements and line statements\nas warnings against danger and downfall; (2) to use the\nChanges in trigrams and hexagrams to understand the ceaseless\nchanges in the natural realm and the human realm; (3) to use hexagram\nimages to enhance rulers\u2019 authority; (4) to use divination to\nprovoke inquirers to think more deeply about their choices\n(Xici I: 9; WB67: 314). Based on these four-fold uses of\nhexagrams, the Xici authors highlight the broad appeal of the\nChanges. It can be a book of \u201cwisdom\u201d\n(zhi \u667a) for those who are interested in pondering the\ncauses and patterns of change; it can be a book of\n\u201ckindness\u201d (ren \u4ec1) for those who are\ninterested in improving the political order; it can be a book of\n\u201clife\u201d (riyong \u65e5\u7528) for those who\njust want to live, overcome obstacles, and make fewer mistakes\n(Xici I: 4; WB67: 298).\n\nRecently, Chung-ying Cheng has suggested that we must stop explaining\n\u201cthe source, the formation, and the system of underlying\nphilosophy\u201d in interpreting the Xici. Rather, we should\nlook at its philosophy as a sustained discussion about time, location,\nand judgment that are derived from the divinatory practices (Cheng\n2020: xi\u2013xvi). In other words, instead of seeing divination and\nphilosophy as categorically exclusive, we see them as a continuum. It\nis from divination that we develop an acute sensitivity to the\ncombined effects of temporal and spatial factors that determine our\njudgment. And it is this acute sensitivity to time and space that\ngives us the mental resources to develop a strategy to solve problems,\na courage to face challenges, and a determination to overcome fear in\ncrises.\n\nFrom this perspective, the discussion of divination in Xici\nI:8 is revealing. The passage goes as follows:\n\n\nThe number of the total is fifty. Of these forty-nine are uses. They\nare divided into two portions, to represent the two primal forces.\nHereupon one is set apart, to represent the three powers. They are\ncounted through by fours, to represent the four seasons. The remainder\nis put aside, to represent the intercalary month. There are two\nintercalary months in five years, therefore the putting aside is\nrepeated, and this gives us the whole. (WB67: 310\u2013311)\n\n\nSet in terse language, the rituals include several steps, as Richard\nWilhelm summarizes.\n\n\nOne takes fifty yarrow stalks, of which only forty-nine are used.\nThese forty-nine are first divided into two heaps [at random], then a\nstalk from the right-hand heap is inserted between the ring finger and\nthe little finger of the left hand. The left heap is counted through\nby fours, and the remainder (four or less) is inserted between the\nring finger and the middle finger. This constitutes one change. Now\none is holding in one\u2019s hand either five or nine stalks in all.\nThe two remaining heaps are put together, and the same process is\nrepeated twice. These second and third times, one obtains either four\nor eight stalks. The five stalks of the first counting and the four of\neach of the succeeding countings are regarded as a unit having the\nnumber value three; the nine stalks of the first counting and the\neight of the succeeding countings have the numerical value two. When\nthree successive changes produce the sum 3+3+3=9, this makes the old\nyang, i.e., a firm line that moves. The sum 2+2+2=6 makes the old yin,\na yielding line that moves. Seven is the young yang, and eight the\nyoung yin; they are not taken into account as individual line. (WB67:\n311)\n\n\nThe goal of these elaborate and repeated rituals is finding hexagrams\nby counting yarrow stalks. In every step of the process, the inquirer\nis reminded that his or her action is part of the continual unfolding\nof the universe. In the end, the inquirer finds a hexagram from which\nhe or she can draw lessons. Hence, the purpose of the entire process\nis stilling the mind, making one more reflexive, and preparing one to\nmake critical decisions.\n\nIn the final passage of Xici II we see a discussion of the\nimportance of decision making in divination.\n\n\nThe eight trigrams point the way by means of their images; the words\naccompanying the lines, and the decisions, speak according to the\ncircumstances. In that the firm and the yielding are interspersed,\ngood fortune and misfortune can be discerned.\n\nChanges and movements are judged according to the furtherance (that\nthey bring). Good fortune and misfortune change according to the\nconditions. Therefore: Love and hate combat each other, and good\nfortune and misfortune result therefrom. The far and the near injure\neach other, and remorse and humiliation result therefrom. The true and\nthe false influence each other, and advantage and injury result\ntherefrom. In all the situations of the Changes it is thus:\nWhen closely related things do not harmonize, misfortune is the\nresult: this gives rise to injury, remorse, and humiliation.\n(Xici II: 12; WB67: 355\u2013355)\n\n\nNo matter how we call it\u2014a critical moment, a pivotal juncture,\nor a turning point\u2014an inquirer engaged in divination is at a\ncrossroads in search of a direction. It is a time when the person\nfeels most vulnerable and perplexed. That person is totally alone in\nthis challenging situation when there is no precedent to guide him or\nher forward, nor are there rule books to help him or her navigate the\ncomplex situation. It is this revealing moment of\n\u201cnothingness\u201d\u2014no precedence, no guidance, nothing to\nhold on to\u2014that the trigrams and hexagrams are intended to\ncapture.\n\nYet, the tone of the authors of Xici is decidedly upbeat and\nproactive in discussing this moment of \u201cnothingness.\u201d They\ntell us that when we engage in divination, we can adjust our plans in\naccordance with the circumstances, think more broadly and creatively\nin searching for solutions, and develop strategies that are outside of\nthe conventions. The goal of practicing the rituals of divination,\nthey declare, is to balance the competing claims, and to make the\nimpossible possible.\n",
