    "main_text": "\n\nFran\u00e7ois Poulain de la Barre (1648\u20131723) is known for his\ntreatises De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des deux sexes [On\nthe Equality of the Two Sexes] (1673), De l\u2019\u00e9ducation\ndes dames [On the Education of Ladies] (1674) and De\nl\u2019excellence des hommes [On the Excellence of Men] (1675).\nDespite its name the third treatise continues his defense of equality\nbetween the sexes by overturning rhetorically presented arguments on\nthe behalf of the excellence of men. Together the three books\nconstitute one of the most detailed analyses of the subjugation of\nwomen written in the seventeenth century.\n\nPoulain\u2019s thought was deeply influenced by Ren\u00e9\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy. He used Descartes\u2019 methods of doubt\nand right reasoning in order to reject prejudices about the\ninferiority of women and his arguments in defense of the equality of\nthe sexes use many insights drawn from Descartes\u2019 account of\nthe nature of the human being. After an introductory biographical\nsketch, this entry will first examine the Cartesian foundations of\nPoulain\u2019s thought and then proceed to a discussion of his\nanalysis of the subjugation of women. Next, his four main arguments\nfor the equality of the sexes are presented and evaluated. The entry\ncloses with a brief discussion of Poulain\u2019s direct and indirect\nrelations to later developments in the history of feminist thought.\nThroughout, the aim is to present Poulain\u2019s core ideas as well\nas examine their philosophical validity.\n",
