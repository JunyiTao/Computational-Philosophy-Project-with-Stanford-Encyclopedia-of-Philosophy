But there are at least four arguments to the effect that\npeople\u2019s preferences really do change over time. First, many\nsuccessful explanations of behavioural change have interpreted the\nempirical behavioural evidence as preference change. These\nexplanations can be differentiated into models of external\ninfluences and models of internal coherence. External\ninfluence models attempt to establish general links between external\nevents and agents\u2019 preference formations. They include, for\nexample, social imitation (Leibenstein 1950), parental influence\n(Cavalli-Sforza 1973), habit formation (Pollack 1976), and the effect\nof production patterns on consumption (Duesenberry 1949). Internal\ncoherence models take certain external influences as given, and model\npreference change as an accommodation of these external influences.\nThey include, for example, religious convictions (Iannaccone 1990) and\nthe effect of cognitive dissonance on preferences (Elster 1982).\n\nA second argument for preference change is based on the correlations\nbetween physiological changes and changes in behaviour. Changes in\nblood sugar levels, for example, are correlated to feeding behaviour,\nsexual behaviour varies with hormonal changes, and many behavioural\npatterns change with increasing age (for references and discussion,\nsee Loewenstein 1996). These correlations are not deterministic; such\nbehavioural changes can be resisted in many cases. It is plausible to\nincorporate these potential physiological effects as visceral\npreferences in the general preference framework, and to treat the\nrelevant physiological changes as closely connected with preference\nchanges.\n\nThird, most humans have introspective evidence for their own\npreferences changing over time. The favourite activities of a child\nare replaced by new pleasures as we grow up. Thus was the experience\nof Shakespeare\u2019s Benedick: \u201c\u2026but doth not the\nappetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot\nendure in his age\u201d (Much ado about nothing Act II,\nScene III). Even in adult life, we are literally overcome by sudden\nand very radical (\u201ctransformative\u201d) changes of preference. Paul (2014) has investigated the types of decision-making that this involves. It would be strange to\nclaim in such cases that it is only our beliefs about the different types of\nactivities that change. Explanations in terms of preference change are\nmuch more in line with how we spontaneously interpret our experiences\nof such changes.\n\nLast, certain concepts like taste refinement or self-restraint cannot\neasily be understood without a notion of real preference change. In\nparticular, self-restraint presupposes that the motivational\ncomponents of one\u2019s self can change, for example, through\nmaturation or social influence; and that one can and should plan\none\u2019s future self by curbing certain appetites or by designing\nthe environment in ways that affect one\u2019s preferences.\n",
