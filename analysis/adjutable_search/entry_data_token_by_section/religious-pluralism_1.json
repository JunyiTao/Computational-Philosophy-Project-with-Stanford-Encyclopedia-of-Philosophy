Possible Responses to Religious Diversity\n\nOne obvious response to religious diversity of any form is to maintain\nthat since there exists no divine reality\u2014since the referent in\nall religious truth claims related to the divine is\nnonexistent\u2014all such claims should be considered false. Another\npossible response, sometimes put forth by religious relativists, is\nthat there is no singular truth when considering mutually incompatible\nreligious claims about reality; more than one of the conflicting sets\nof specific truth-claims can be correct concurrently (Runzo 1988,\n351\u2013357). However, most current discussions of religious\ndiversity presuppose a realist theory of truth\u2014that there is a\ntruth to the matter.\n\nUnfortunately there is no standard way to categorize responses to the\ndiversity of perspectives on religious truth claims. Religious\nexclusivism and religious pluralism appear in most categorizations,\nbut not always with the same meanings. Religious inclusivism also\nsometime appears, but primarily in discussions about sufficient\nconditions for spending eternity with God, as it does in the\ndiscussion below (section 8) on the Eternal Destiny of Humankind.\nAccordingly, our general discussion of religious truth claims will\nfocus on three basic categories: religious exclusivism, religious\nnon-exclusivism, and religious pluralism. For our purposes,\nindividuals are religious exclusivists when they believe that their\nperspective on some disputed inter-theistic truth claim\u2014for\nexample, that Allah is the true God\u2014or some disputed\nintra-theistic truth claim\u2014for example, that the Christian God\ncannot control free human choice\u2014to be the truth or at least\ncloser to the truth than any other competing religious perspective on\nthis\n issue.[1]\n Individuals are religious non-exclusivists with respect to a disputed\nreligious truth claim when they deny that any given religious\nperspective on this claim is superior to all other competing religious\nperspectives on this issue. Finally, individuals are religious\npluralists with respect to a given inter-theistic or intra-theistic\ntruth claim when they maintain not only (as non-exclusivists) that no\nsingle religious perspective is superior to all others but also make a\npositive claim about the truth of the matter. The nature of this claim\ndepends on the type of issue in question. If the issue is one on which\nit is possible that the perspectives of more than one religion or\nvariant thereof could be true\u2014for example, the sufficient\nconditions for spending eternity in God\u2019s presence\u2014pluralists\nclaim that the religious perspectives of more than one basic theistic\nsystem or variant thereof can justifiably be considered equally close\nto the truth (Marbaniang 2010). If the issue is one on which there can\nbe only one actual truth to the matter, but we have no objective means\nof determining exactly what that truth is\u2014for example, the\nactual nature of God\u2014pluralists claim that the perspectives of\nmore than one basic theistic system or variant thereof can justifiably\nbe considered to reflect some aspect of this truth (Byrne 2011,\n 36\u20137).[2]\n",
