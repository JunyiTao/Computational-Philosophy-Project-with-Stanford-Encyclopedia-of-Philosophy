    "main_text": "\n\nThis article discusses several interrelated questions that\nphilosophers, theologians, and psychologists address about religious\nemotions. Do they have some essence? Is there one emotion-type that\nwarrants the title \u201creligious,\u201d or are there many\nreligious emotion-types? How do religious emotions differ from\n\u201cordinary\u201d emotions? Is \u2018emotion\u2019 the right\nword for the experiences under consideration? Are religious emotions\n\u201ccognitive\u201d or \u201cnon-cognitive,\u201d\n\u201crational\u201d or \u201cnon-rational\u201d? What good are\nthey? What epistemic import, if any, have they? This article will\nfocus on emotions in or purportedly in the Judeo-Christian\ntradition.\n",
