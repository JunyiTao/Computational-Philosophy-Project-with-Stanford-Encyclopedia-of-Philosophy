    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk || Uses and Extensions of the Concept\n2.6 Uses and Extensions of the Concept\n\nCornel West extends the analytic grasp of the concept as part of a\ncritical discussion of double-consciousness in his first book,\nProphecy Deliverance! (1982). In the first chapter, West\nsuggests an ingredient missing from Du Bois\u2019s analysis of the\nself-consciousness of Africans in America, claiming that\n\nDu Bois overlooked the broader dialectic of being American yet feeling\nEuropean, of being provincial but yearning for British\ncosmopolitanism, of being at once incompletely civilized and\nmaterially prosperous, a genteel Brahmin amid uncouth conditions.\nBlack Americans labored rather under the burden of a triple crisis of\nself-consciousness. Their cultural predicament was comprised of\nAfrican appearance and unconscious cultural mores, involuntary\ndisplacement to America without American status, and American\nalienation from the European ethos complicated through domination by\nincompletely European Americans. (1982: 30\u20131)\n\n\nWest further complicates his own enumeration of the tangled elements\nof the African-American cultural dialectic, referring to the\n\u201canxiety-ridden provinciality\u201d of Protestant-American\nself-identity, and the \u201cdistinctly antimodern values and\nsensibilities\u201d dominant in the southern states, the\n\u201cgeographic cradle of black America\u201d (1982: 31).\n\nWest\u2019s formulations do not unmake but add refinements on Du\nBois\u2019s basic claim. It\u2019s worth noting that, near the end\nof West\u2019s discussion, he acknowledges that, in the first\nattempts to shape their own self-identity, \u201cBlack people were\nrelatively uninformed about British culture\u2026\u201d. This seems\nto minimize the significance of \u201cBritish cosmopolitanism\u201d\nand \u201calienation from the European ethos\u201d as issues for\nblack folk in America generally.\n\nIn The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness\n(1993) Paul Gilroy extends Du Boisian double-consciousness both beyond\nthe American context and at odds with an essentialist understanding of\nrace. Gilroy claims double consciousness as an overriding thematic\nelement in Du Bois\u2019s thought and writing, both in and beyond\nSouls, part of Du Bois\u2019s attempt to subvert rigidly\nfixed racial identities as imposed categories keyed to the oppressive\nsocial structures of white supremacy. The \u201cStrivings\u201d text\nis taken as one early expression of Du Bois\u2019s own ambivalence\ntoward modernity \u2013 an ambivalence shared widely in diasporic\nblack cultures and political debates \u2013 and as prefiguring the\nincreasingly transnational and pan-racial scope of Du Bois\u2019s\nevolving concerns.\n\nIn a reading of Souls that is central to his book, Gilroy\nhighlights the\n\nnagging anxiety over the inner contradictions of modernity and a\nradical scepticism towards the ideology of progress with which it is\nassociated (1993: 117)\n\n\nhe finds there in germ form. Elements of an implicit global-diasporic\n\u2013 hence \u201cBlack Atlantic\u201d \u2013 perspective on\n\u201cthe meaning of being black\u201d in that text are in tension\nwith, and textually submerged under, the \u201csmooth flow of\nAfrican-American exceptionalisms\u201d (1993: 120). These elements\nwithin the discourse of Souls point to the wider significance\nof double consciousness, according to Gilroy. He claims this\nglobal-diasporic theme would, subsequent to Souls, come\n\u201cto illuminate the experience of post-slave populations in\ngeneral\u201d and to \u201canimate a dream of global co-operation\namong people of color which came to full fruition only in [Du\nBois\u2019] later work\u201d (1993: 126).\n\nPaget Henry\u2019s phenomenological treatment of Du Bois\u2019s\nconception in his \u201cAfricana Phenomenology: Its Philosophical\nImplications\u201d (2005) identifies a \u201ctheory\u201d of double\nconsciousness as part of a \u201ccomprehensive phenomenology of\nAfricana self-consciousness\u201d (2005: 85). Henry distinguishes Du\nBoisian double-consciousness from the double consciousness found in\nHegel\u2019s discussion of lordship and bondage in the\nPhenomenology by its focus on \u2018the Africana\nsubject\u2019 Hegel neglected entirely. Henry offers further\nan explication of Du Boisian \u201csecond sight\u201d: on his view,\nit is\n\nthe ability of the racialized Africana subject to see him/herself as\n\u201ca negro\u201d, that is, through the eyes of the white other.\n(2005: 89)\n\n\nHenry characterizes this as a \u201ccategoric form of self-blindness\n\u2026 a classic case of false consciousness\u201d (2005: 90). But\nHenry claims a further, ethically propitious form of second sight is\npossible \u2013 what he calls \u201cpotentiated second sight\u201d.\nThis is a \u201cvery special access and insight into the dehumanizing\n\u2018will to power\u2019 of the European imperial subject\u201d.\nThis \u201cpotentiating\u201d of second sight can occur, according\nto Henry, when an Africana subject is able to uproot the\n\u201cblackface\u201d stereotype from her consciousness and\nreconceive herself as \u201can African\u201d by operating\n\u201cwithin the creative codes of African discourses and\nsymbols\u201d (2005: 91). Henry cites the Rastafarians as an example\nof this route to potentiated second sight. An alternate route is\nthrough an individually acquired standpoint on the world, independent\nof white supremacy: Du Bois himself is an exemplar.\n\nHenry sees a close relation between Du Boisian double-consciousness\nand Frantz Fanon\u2019s existential-psychoanalytic account of black\nself-consciousness, found in Fanon\u2019s Black Skin, White\nMasks (1967). Noting the Freudian and Sartrean idiom in which\nFanon carries through his analyses in that text, Henry writes that\n\u201cthere is no finer or more detailed account of the state of\nracial double consciousness\u201d (2005: 95). In the very first pages\nof that text, Fanon makes clear his psychoanalytic orientation,\nwriting of the black\u2019s \u201cinferiority complex\u201d \u2013\na term first appearing in the book in an epigraph from Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism. Fanon\nobserves that\n\nThe effective disalienation of the black man entails an immediate\nrecognition of social and economic realities. If there is an\ninferiority complex, it is the outcome of a double process: primarily,\neconomic; subsequently, the internalization \u2013 or better, the\nepidermalization \u2013 of this inferiority. (1967: 10\u201311)\n\n\nHenry details a process he dubs \u201cnegrification\u201d, to which\nthe black is subject in the confines of the West. In that process,\n\u201ccolonized Africana people lost their earlier cultural\nidentities and became identified by the color of their skin\u201d\n(2005: 96). The white colonizer projects the most reprehensible and\nforbidden aspects of himself onto the black man, thereby bringing\nabout the stereotype of \u201cthe Negro\u201d. Fanon also borrows\nJungian formulations for his account, writing of the \u201ccollective\nunconscious of homo occidentalis\u201d, in which the black\nman \u201csymbolizes evil, sin, wretchedness, death, war,\nfamine\u201d. Referring to his native land, Fanon writes\n\n[i]n Martinique, whose collective unconscious makes it a European\ncountry, when a \u201cblue\u201d Negro \u2013 a coal-black one\n\u2013 comes to visit, one reacts at once: \u201cWhat bad luck is he\nbringing?\u201d (1967: 191)\n\n\nIn an earlier text, Caliban\u2019s Reason (2000), Henry uses\nthe Shakespearean motif, from The Tempest, of the clash of\nthe European colonizer Prospero with the native Caliban. He cites the\n\u201cCalibanization\u201d of the Africans imported by European\nslavers to the Caribbean:\n\n[C]olor eclipsed culture. \u2026 Africans were transformed into\nnegroes and niggers in the minds of Europeans. This racial violence\nshattered the cultural foundations of the African self\u2026. Race\nbecame the primary signifier of Europeans and Africans and of the\ndifferences between them. Consequently, the identities of these two\ngroups were rigidly inscribed in a set of binary oppositions that\nlinked the binary black/white to other binaries such as\nprimitive/civilized, irrational/rational, body/mind,\nprelogical/logical, flesh/spirit. (2000: 11\u20132)\n\n\nHenry sees Calibanization \u2013 the imposition of a racialized\nidentity based on a set of insidiously contrastive binaries on top of\nan original and native cultural identity grounded in African ways of\nlife \u2013 as the production of a form of double consciousness.\n\nLewis Gordon touches on double consciousness in his Introduction\nto Africana Philosophy (2008). Gordon starts from Du Bois\u2019s\n\u2018unasked\u2019 question, \u201cHow does it feel to be a\nproblem?\u201d For Gordon, this question presupposes the\nsubjectivity, and the humanity, of the black person being addressed.\nAnd yet, the ascription of the status of a \u201cproblem\u201d to\nthat person involves at the same time a denial of the\nhumanity of that black addressee. Gordon notes that \u201c[t]he\nappeal to blacks as problem-people is an assertion of their ultimate\nlocation outside the system of order and rationality\u201d (2008:\n76). This outsider status, Gordon suggests, is crucial to the\nformation of double consciousness, leading as it does to \u201cthe\nsplitting of worlds and consciousness itself according to the norms of\nU.S. society and its contradictions\u201d. Those norms instantiate\nthe fact that \u201c\u2018American\u2019 was persistently defined\nas \u2018white\u2019 in North America and the rest of the\nAmericas\u201d (2008: 77).\n\nGordon takes the \u201cnegative version\u201d of double\nconsciousness to result when the self-image of the black person is\nwholly determined by how racial others view her \u2013 her view of\nherself is a \u201cwhite point of view\u201d (2008: 78), relegating\nher to the status of noncitizen or second class citizen. Its\nepistemological significance is that one of the two perspectives\nimplicit in it \u2013 that of the white world \u2013 is necessarily\npartial, yet positions itself as universal, and so, is \u201ca form\nof consciousness that hides itself\u201d (2008: 79). But this\ndominant white self-concept brings into being a\n\u201csubaltern\u201d consciousness, a consciousness of the\ncontradictions of that dominant self-concept. This, Gordon claims, is\nthe second, doubling consciousness in its affirmative, fully realized\nmanifestation.\n",
