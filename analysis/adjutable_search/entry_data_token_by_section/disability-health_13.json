The reluctance of many\nparents to have a disabled child often rests on an exaggerated view of\nthe physical and emotional demands of raising such children, or on a\nfailure to appreciate the capacities of such children to form\nrewarding parent-child relationships. The latter is likely to play a\nmajor role in the strength of the desire to avoid having a child with\na serious cognitive impairment. Indeed, surveys show that prospective\nparents are far more reluctant to have a child with a cognitive or\naffective impairment than a sensory or motor impairment (Wertz 1998).\n\n This reluctance may also rest to a great extent on the\noverwhelming salience of the impairment in a setting where little else\ncan be known about the future child. That salience reinforces the\nalready-powerful tendency to see only the stigmatized trait. Botkin\nmay express the dominant view among prospective parents in arguing\nthat the burden of raising a child with a disability should be treated\nas equivalent to the burden of raising an unwanted child (Botkin 1995:\n32\u201339).  Ferguson argues that the findings from research and\nfrom parent narratives in the past thirty years contradict such\nassertions and demonstrate that families with a child who has a\ndisability look much like other families in terms of satisfaction,\nstress, and system functioning (Ferguson 2001: 373\u201395). Other\nresearch suggests that raising children with severe cognitive and\nother disabilities has greater stresses but similar rewards\n(Aschbrenner, et al. 2010; Blacher and Baker 2007; Gerstein et\nal. 2009).\n\nProspective parents with disabilities are less likely to be encumbered\nby these stereotypes about disabled children, but they may believe\nthat their disabilities have been sufficiently difficult for them that\nthey do not want to pass them on to their children. Moreover, even if\ntheir impairment is not genetic and they are likely to become the\nbiological parent of a child without a disability, they must struggle\nwith deeply-rooted skepticism about their own ability to parent\ndisabled or nondisabled children. If one of the most pervasive\nassumptions about disability is its association with a need for help\nor \u201ccare\u201d from others, the person with a disability may\nthink herself incapable of doing so for others.\n\nThe prospect of parenting by people with disabilities provides an\nopportunity to consider the question of which components of customary\nparent-child relationships are essential to good parenting (Blustein\n1982; Ruddick 1998; O\u2019Neill 2002). Parents with disabilities,\nparticularly cognitive disabilities, are often regarded as unfit to\nmeet the \u201cspecial needs\u201d of disabled children, and\nincapable of serving as mentors and role models for nondisabled\nchildren. Although some judicial decisions, empirical reports, and\npersonal narratives recognize that many people with physical, sensory,\naffective, and cognitive impairments can effectively raise children\nalone or with some assistance, daily life, social service agencies,\nand attitudes of professionals and the public still thwart people with\ndisabilities in their parenting goals (Collings and Llewellyn\n2012; Picciuto 2015). However, social attitudes\nare gradually changing as examples of successful parenting by people\nwith disabilities proliferate (Mutcherson 2008).\n",
