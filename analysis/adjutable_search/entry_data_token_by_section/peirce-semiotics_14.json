As a chain\nof signs moves towards a final end there are different interpretants\nplaying different but important roles. Peirce identifies three\ndifferent ways in which we grasp the way a sign stands for an object.\nHe calls these three types of interpretant, the immediate\ninterpretant, the dynamic interpretant and the final\ninterpretant and describes them like this.\n\nThe [Dynamic] Interpretant is whatever interpretation any mind\nactually makes of a sign. [\u2026]The Final Interpretant does not\nconsist in the way in which any mind does act but in the way in which\nevery mind would act. That is, it consists in a truth which might be\nexpressed in a conditional proposition of this type: \u201cIf so and\nso were to happen to any mind this sign would determine that mind to\nsuch and such conduct.\u201d [\u2026] The Immediate Interpretant\nconsists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to\nproduce, not to any actual reaction. [\u2026] [I]f there be any\nfourth kind of Interpretant on the same footing as those three, there\nmust be a dreadful rupture of my mental retina, for I can\u2019t see it at\nall. (CP8 .315 1909).\n\n\nWe shall examine each of these in turn, but to get a clearer\nunderstanding of the three interpretants it is helpful to look, very\nbriefly, at Peirce\u2019s three grades of clarity, or understanding since\nPeirce took these to inform his division of interpretants.\n\nIn his 1878 paper, \u201cHow To Make Our Ideas Clear\u201d (W3,\n257\u2013275) Peirce introduces three grades of clarity, or levels of\nunderstanding. In this paper, he introduces his famous pragmatic maxim\nas a development of rationalist notions of \u201cclear and distinct\nideas\u201d. Combining his pragmatic maxim with notions of clarity\nfrom Descartes and Leibniz, Peirce identifies three grades of\nunderstanding. The first grade of clarity is to have an unreflective\ngrasp of some concept in everyday experience. The second grade of\nclarity is to have, or be capable of providing, a general definition\nof that concept. The third grade of clarity, though, comes from\nPeirce\u2019s famous statement of the pragmatic maxim:\n\nConsider what effects, which might conceivably have practical\nbearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject. (W3, 266)\n\n\nA full understanding of some concept, then, involves familiarity with\nit in day-to-day encounters, the ability to offer some general\ndefinition of it, and knowing what effects to expect from holding that\nconcept to be true.\n\nAlthough these grades of clarity are part of Peirce\u2019s pragmatism, his\ngreater understanding of the interconnectedness of his thought led him\nto realize that they were also crucial to his work on semiotic. In\nparticular, he saw the three grades of clarity or understanding as\nreflected in his notion of the interpretant and of course felt that\nthe interpretant also had three grades or divisions. Peirce himself\nsays:\n\nIn the Second Part of my [\u201cHow To Make Our Ideas Clear\u201d],\nI made three grades of clearness of Interpretation. The first was such\nFamiliarity as gave a person familiarity with a sign and readiness in\nusing it or interpreting it. In his consciousness he seemed to himself\nto be quite at home with the Sign. [\u2026] The second was Logical\nAnalysis [and is equivalent to] Lady Welby\u2019s Sense. The third was\nPragmatistic Analysis [and is] identified with the Final Interpretant.\n(CP8 .185 1909).\n\n\nHere, then, Peirce identifies the first grade of clarity with the\ndynamic interpretant, the second grade with the immediate\ninterpretant, and the third grade with the final interpretant.\n4.2.1 The Immediate Interpretant\n\nAs its identification with the second grade of clarity suggests, the\nimmediate interpretant is a general definitional understanding of the\nrelationship between the sign and dynamic object. In an extended\nexample, where the dynamic object is the weather on a stormy day,\nPeirce describes the immediate interpretant as \u201cthe schema in\n[our] imagination, i.e. the vague Image of what there is in common to\nthe different images of a stormy day\u201d (CP8 .314 1907). The\nimmediate interpretant, then, is something like recognition of the\nsyntax of the sign and the more general features of its meaning.\nIndeed, Peirce seems to take the immediate interpretant to be\n\u201call that is explicit in the sign apart from its context and\ncircumstances of utterance\u201d (CP5 .473 1907). Also instructive\nis David Savan\u2019s description of the immediate interpretant as the:\n\nexplicit content of the sign which would enable a person to say\nwhether or not the sign was applicable to anything concerning which\nthat person had sufficient acquaintance. It is the total unanalyzed\nimpression which the sign might be expected to produce, prior to any\ncritical reflection upon it. (Savan 1988, 53).\n\n\nIn terms of an example where ordinary sentences are the signs, the\nimmediate interpretant will involve something like our recognition of\ngrammatical categories, syntactic structures and conventional rules of\nuse. For instance, without knowing anything about its context of\nutterance, we can surmise certain things about the sentence, \u201cwe\ndon\u2019t want to hurt him, do we?\u201d. We know it is a question, we\nknow it concerns doing harm to some person, a male, and so on. These\nthings are part of the immediate interpretant of the sign.\n4.2.2 The Dynamic Interpretant\n\nThe second type of interpretant that any sign must have is the dynamic\ninterpretant. This is our understanding of the sign/dynamic object\nrelationship at some actual instance in the chain of signs. Peirce\ndescribes the dynamic interpretant as the \u201ceffect actually\nproduced on the mind\u201d (CP8 .343 1908), or as the \u201cactual\neffect which the sign, as a sign, really determines\u201d (CP4 .536\n1906). The dynamic interpretant, then, is the understanding we\nreach, or which the sign determines, at any particular semiotic\nstage.\n\nTo continue with linguistic examples, we know that the dynamic\ninterpretant is the actual interpretation we make, or understanding we\nreach, in the first instance of interpretation. For instance, when you\nsay to me whilst pointing at some cowardly woman we know, \u201cI saw\nher duck under the table\u201d, the dynamic interpretant is my\nunderstanding that you are the utterer, that I am the addressee, and\nthat you saw our cowardly acquaintance hide beneath a table.\n\nThere is also an interesting connection between the dynamic\ninterpretant and the immediate object. As the understanding we\nactually reach at any particular point in the sign chain, the dynamic\ninterpretant represents an incomplete understanding, or\ninterpretation, of the dynamic object. More important, though, is that\nthe immediate object of some sign in a sign chain consists of the\nactual interpretations made previously, that is, it consists of the\ndynamic interpretants from earlier stages in the sign chain. As\nRansdell (1977, 169) puts it, the \u201cimmediate object is, in other\nwords, the funded result of all interpretation prior to the\ninterpretation of the given sign\u201d. The dynamic interpretant\nthen, is the actual interpretation or understanding we make at some\npoint in the semiotic process, and also constitutes, along with\nprevious dynamic interpretants, the immediate object, or partial\nunderstanding we have of the dynamic object at any particular point in\nthe semiotic process.\n4.2.3 The Final Interpretant\n\nPeirce describes the final interpretant as, \u201cthat which would\nfinally be decided to be the true interpretation if consideration of\nthe matter were carried so far that an ultimate opinion were\nreached\u201d (CP8 .184 1909). Elsewhere he describes it as the\n\u201ceffect that would be produced on the mind by the sign after\nsufficient development of thought\u201d (CP8 .343 1908). The final\ninterpretant, then, seems to be what our understanding of the dynamic\nobject would be at the end of inquiry, that is, if we had a reached a\ntrue understanding of the dynamic object. Peirce\u2019s notion of inquiry\nis clearly central here. As Hookway points out, we might best define\nthe final interpretant as the understanding:\n\nwhich would be reached if a process of enriching the interpretant\nthrough scientific enquiry were to proceed indefinitely. It\nincorporates a complete and true conception of the objects of the\nsign; it is the interpretant we should all agree on in the long run.\n(Hookway 1985, 139).\n\n\nAs an example, consider again the kinds of utterance that we have\nalready looked at. In such a case as your uttering, \u201cI saw her\nduck under the table\u201d, the final interpretant would be the\nunderstanding where there is \u201cno latitude of interpretation at\nall\u201d (CP5 .447 1905), that is, where the meanings of the\nwords, the identity of the agents involved and so on, are absolutely\ndeterminate. So, the final interpretant of your utterance of \u201cI\nsaw her duck under the table\u201d is my coming to a determinate\nunderstanding of what you mean. We can envisage how this would come\nabout, by my asking a variety of questions, like \u201care you using\n\u2018duck\u2019 as a verb or a noun?\u201d, or even \u201care you\ntalking to me?\u201d and developing a series of dynamic interpretants\nthat get us closer and closer to the final interpretant.\n\nJust as the dynamic interpretant has clear connections with other\nelements of Peirce\u2019s semiotic, so too does the final interpretant. As\nshould be clear, from the connections that emerge from the notion of\ninquiry, the final interpretant interacts strongly with the dynamic\nobject. The final interpretant, then, is important to our\nunderstanding of the dynamic object in a couple of ways. First, it is\nthe point where our grasp of the dynamic object would be complete and,\naccording to Ransdell (1977, 169\u2013170), is where the immediate\nobject and the dynamic object coincide. This represents the full\nassimilation or integration of the dynamic object into our system of\nsigns. Second, the final interpretant functions as an exemplar or\nnormative standard by which we can judge our actual interpretative\nresponses to the sign. As David Savan puts it, \u201cPeirce\u2019s\nintention was to identify the third type of interpretant as providing\na norm or standard by which particular stages (Dynamical\nInterpretants) of an historical process may be judged.\u201d (Savan\n1988, 62).\n\nFrom the point of view of Peirce scholars, an interesting element of\nthis division of objects and interpretants is how it might be used to\ninform accounts of meaning raised in analytic philosophy of\nlanguage. Risto Hilpinen (2019), for instance, argues that we can see\nclear parallels between Peirce\u2019s immediate object and\nFrege\u2019s notion of \u201csense\u201d. Atkin (2008a) suggests a\nrange of connections between Peirce\u2019s later division of objects\nand interpretants and analytic accounts of meaning and reference, and\neven identifies a historical connection between Peirce\u2019s\naccounts of signs and recent work on meaning by John Perry (Atkin\n2008b). (For other related work on Peirce\u2019s sign\ntheories as accounts of reference and meaning see Bellucci\n2021, Agler 2010, and Hilpinen 2015).\n",
