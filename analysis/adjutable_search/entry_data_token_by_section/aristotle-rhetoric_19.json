    "main_text": "The Topoi || The (Lacking) Definition of \u2018Topos\u2019\n7.1 The (Lacking) Definition of \u2018Topos\u2019\n\nIt is striking that the work that is almost exclusively dedicated to\nthe collection of topoi, the book Topics, does not\neven make an attempt to define the concept of topos. At any\nrate the Rhetoric gives a sort of defining characterization:\n\u201cI call the same thing element and topos; for an\nelement or a topos is a heading under which many enthymemes\nfall\u201d (Rhet. 1403a18\u201319). By\n\u2018element\u2019 Aristotle does not mean a proper part of the\nenthymeme, but rather a general scheme under which many concrete\nenthymemes of the same type can be subsumed. According to this\ndefinition, the topos is a general argumentative scheme or\npattern, and the concrete arguments are instantiations of the general\ntopos. That the topos is a general instruction from\nwhich several arguments can be derived is crucial for\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of an artful method of argumentation;\nfor a teacher of rhetoric who makes his pupils learn ready samples of\narguments would not be imparting the art itself to them, but only the\nproducts of this art, just as if someone pretending to teach the art\nof shoe-making only gave samples of already made shoes to his pupils\n(see Sophistical Refutations 183b36ff.).\n",
