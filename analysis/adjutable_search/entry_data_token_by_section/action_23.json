After all, if agency can be\nmanifested without any events being present, it is difficult to see\nhow agency can be explained in the terms of the standard story of\naction (that is, in terms of the causal history of the bodily\nmovements that manifest our agency). Hornsby (2004) argues that the\nfailure of the standard causal theory to account for omissions is\nsymptomatic of its more general failure to locate the agent in an\naccount of intentional action that reduces agency to causal\nconnections between non-agential happenings.\n\nThere are at least two ways in which causal theorists try to answer\nthese charges. One possibility is to argue that even though\nintentional omissions are absences, what makes them intentional is\nthat facts about their causal history are analogous to the facts about\ncausal history that make \u201dpositive actions\u201c instances of\nagency (Clarke 2010; 2014). On this view, just as positive actions are\ncaused by an intention, intentional omissions are cases in which the\nnon-obtaining of a certain event is similarly explained by an\nintention. However, Sartorio (2009) argues that intentional omissions\npose a serious challenge even to this broader understanding of the\nstandard causal theory of action. Sartorio argues that intentional\nomissions are often not best explained by other events (such as the\nformation of an intention), but by the non-occurrence of\ncertain events (the best explanation of why I omitted to help my\nfriend move might be that I omitted to form the intention to\nhelp them, rather than that I did form the intention not to help\nthem). Another strategy to make omissions compatible with the standard\ncausal theory is to try to show that omissions are events, while\navoiding the questionable view that the omission must be identified\nwith what the agent intentionally did at the time of the omission\n(Payton 2021).\n",
