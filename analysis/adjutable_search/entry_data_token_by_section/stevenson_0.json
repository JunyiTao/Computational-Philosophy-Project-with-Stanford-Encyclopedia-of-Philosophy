    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nC. L. Stevenson was born in 1908 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In his youth, he\ndeveloped a life-long passion for literature and the arts, especially\npoetry and music, whose power to influence a person\u2019s emotions and\nactions fascinated him\u2014a fascination that would remain at the\ncenter of Stevenson\u2019s personal and professional life.\n\nIn 1926, Stevenson entered Yale University, earning a prize for best\nentrance examination for piano at the Yale School of Music. He\ngraduated from Yale in 1930 with a B.A. in English Literature, a field\nhe intended to pursue upon entering Cambridge University, England\nlater that year. While at Cambridge, however, Stevenson became\nincreasingly attracted to philosophy, in large part because of\nacquaintances with I. A. Richards, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig\nWittgenstein. Each of these figures produced important, and different,\nkinds of work on the nature, analysis, and use of language, had strong\npersonalities, and shared Stevenson\u2019s love for literature, arts, and\naesthetics. Stevenson earned his B.A. in Philosophy from Cambridge in\n1933 and entered Harvard that same year to earn his Ph.D. in Philosophy,\nwhich he received in 1935. While at Harvard, Stevenson worked closely\nwith Ralph Barton Perry, whose General Theory of Value\n(1926), conversant in early American pragmatism and early Continental\nphenomenology, had a lasting influence on Stevenson\u2019s work (Sartris\n1984; Warnock 1978).\n\nStevenson remained at Harvard as an instructor for three years until\n1938, during which time three early essays were published in\nMind: \u201cThe Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms\u201d\n(1937), \u201cEthical Judgments and Avoidability\u201d (1938a), and\n\u201cPersuasive Definitions\u201d (1938b). In 1939, Stevenson\naccepted the position of Assistant Professor at Yale, where he\nremained until 1946, and during which time his landmark Ethics and\nLanguage was published in 1944. One of the conclusions Stevenson\nreached in this book was that some ethical disputes may be rationally\nirresolvable. Apparently on these grounds, and in the historical\ncontext of World War II atrocity, Stevenson was denied\n tenure.[1]\n The University of Michigan immediately offered Stevenson a position\nas Associate Professor, which he accepted, and where he remained until\n1978. Stevenson\u2019s most important articles in ethics are collected in\nFacts and Values (1963a), which also contains an informative\nretrospective essay (1963b) that clarifies, expands, and refines his\nmature views. His partly related work in aesthetics (e.g., 1950b,\n1957, 1958) remains uncollected.\n\nStevenson passed away in 1979 in Bennington, Vermont, where he had\nmoved to be near family and where he had accepted a position as\nProfessor of Philosophy at Bennington College. He was survived by his\nsecond wife Nora, whom he married in 1965, after the death, two years\nearlier, of his first wife, Louise. With Louise, Stevenson had three\nchildren, including acclaimed poet Anne Stevenson.\n",
