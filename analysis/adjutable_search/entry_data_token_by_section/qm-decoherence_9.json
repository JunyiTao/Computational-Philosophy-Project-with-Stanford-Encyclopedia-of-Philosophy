    "main_text": "The Role(s) of Decoherence in Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics || Pilot-wave theories\n3.2 Pilot-wave theories\n\n\u2018Hidden variables\u2019 approaches seek to explain quantum\nphenomena as equilibrium statistical effects arising from a\ndeeper-level theory, rather strongly in analogy with attempts at\nunderstanding thermodynamics in terms of statistical mechanics (see\nthe entry on\n philosophy of statistical mechanics).\n Of these, the most developed are the so-called pilot-wave theories,\nin particular the theory by de Broglie and Bohm (see also the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics).\n Pilot-wave theories are no-collapse formulations of quantum mechanics\nthat assign to the wave function the role of determining the evolution\nof (\u2018piloting\u2019, \u2018guiding\u2019) the variables\ncharacterising the system, say particle configurations, as in de\nBroglie\u2019s (1928) and Bohm\u2019s (1952) theory, or fermion\nnumber density, as in Bell\u2019s (1987, Chapter 19)\n\u2018beable\u2019 quantum field theory, or again field\nconfigurations, as in various proposals for pilot-wave quantum field\ntheories (for a recent survey, see Struyve 2011).\n\nDe Broglie\u2019s idea was to modify classical Hamiltonian mechanics\nin such a way as to make it analogous to classical wave optics, by\nsubstituting for Hamilton and Jacobi\u2019s action function the phase\n\\(S\\) of a physical wave. Such a \u2018wave mechanics\u2019 of\ncourse yields non-classical motions, but in order to understand how de\nBroglie\u2019s dynamics relates to typical quantum phenomena, we must\ninclude Bohm\u2019s (1952, Part II) analysis of the appearance of\ncollapse. In the case of measurements, Bohm argued that the wave\nfunction evolves into a superposition of components that are and\nremain separated in the total configuration space of measured system\nand apparatus, so that the total configuration is\n\u2018trapped\u2019 inside a single component of the wave\nfunction, which will guide its further evolution, as if the wave had\ncollapsed (\u2018effective\u2019 wave function). This analysis\nallows one to recover the apparent collapse upon measurement (and the\nquantum probabilities are further recovered via statistical\nconsiderations). \n\nIt is natural to extend this analysis from the case of measurements\ninduced by an apparatus to that of \u2018spontaneous\nmeasurements\u2019 as performed by the environment in the theory of\ndecoherence, thus applying the same strategy to recover both quantum\nand classical phenomena. The resulting picture is one in which de\nBroglie\u2013Bohm theory, in cases of decoherence, describes the\nmotion of particles that are trapped inside one of the extremely well\nlocalised components selected by the decoherence interaction. Thus, de\nBroglie\u2013Bohm trajectories will partake of the classical motions\non the level defined by decoherence (the width of the components).\nThis use of decoherence would arguably resolve the puzzles discussed,\ne.g., by Holland (1996) with regard to the possibility of a\n\u2018classical limit\u2019 of de Broglie\u2019s theory. One\nbaffling problem, for instance, is that trajectories with different\ninitial conditions cannot cross in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory,\nbecause the wave guides the particles by way of a first-order\nequation, while, as is well known, Newton\u2019s equations are\nsecond-order and possible trajectories in Newton\u2019s theory do\ncross. Now, however, the non-interfering components produced by\ndecoherence can indeed cross, and so will the trajectories of\nparticles trapped inside them.\n\nIf the main instances of decoherence are indeed coextensive with\ninstances of separation in configuration, de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory\ncan thus use the results of decoherence relating to the\nformation of classical structures, while providing an interpretation\nof quantum mechanics that explains why these structures are indeed\nobservationally\n relevant.[24]\n This picture is natural, but not self-evident. De Broglie\u2013Bohm\ntheory and decoherence contemplate two a priori distinct\nmechanisms connected to apparent collapse: respectively, separation of\ncomponents in configuration space and suppression of interference.\nWhile the former obviously implies the latter, it is equally obvious\nthat decoherence need not imply separation in configuration space. One\ncan expect, however, that decoherence interactions of the form of\napproximate position measurements will.\n\nA discussion of the role of decoherence in pilot-wave theory in the\nform suggested above has been given by Rosaler (2015, 2016). An\ninformal discussion is given in Bohm and Hiley (1993, Chapter 8),\npartial results are given by Appleby\n (1999),[25]\n and some simulations have been realised by Sanz and co-workers (e.g.\nSanz and Borondo\n 2009).[26]\n Relevant results have also been derived by Toro\u0161, Donadi and\nBassi (2016) who show quantitative correspondence with a spontaneous\ncollapse model (see also Romano 2016). A rather different approach is\ninstead suggested by Allori (2001; see also Allori and Zangh\u00ec\n 2009).[27]\n\nWhile, as argued above, it appears plausible that decoherence might be\ninstrumental in recovering the classicality of pilot-wave trajectories\nin the case of the non-relativistic particle theory, it is less clear\nwhether this strategy might work equally well in the case of field\ntheory. Doubts to this effect have been raised, e.g., by Saunders\n(1999) and by Wallace (2008, 2012b). Essentially, these authors doubt\nwhether the configuration-space variables, or some coarse-grainings\nthereof, are, indeed, decohering\n variables.[28]\n",
