    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It || Metaphysical Deduction\n2.2 Metaphysical Deduction\n\n\nThe Aesthetic is about the conditions of experience, Kant\u2019s official\nproject. The chapter leading up to the Transcendental Deduction, The\nClue to the Discovery of All Pure Concepts of the Understanding (but\ngenerally called the Metaphysical Deduction because of a remark that\nKant once made, B159) has a very different starting point.\n\n\nStarting from (and, Bvii, taking for granted the adequacy of) Aristotelian\nlogic (the syllogisms and the formal concepts that Aristotle called categories), Kant proceeds by analysis to draw out the implications of these concepts and syllogisms for the conceptual structure (the \u201cfunction of thought in judgment\u201d (A70=B95)) within which all thought and experience must take place. The result is what Kant called the \n Categories. That is to say, Kant tries to deduce the conceptual structure of experience from the components of Aristotelian logic.\n\n\nThus, in Kant\u2019s thought about the mind early in CPR, there\nis not one central movement but two, one in the Transcendental\nAesthetic and the other in the Metaphysical Deduction. The first is a\nmove up from experience (of objects) to the necessary conditions of\nsuch experience. The second is a move down from the Aristotelian functions\nof judgment to the concepts that we have to use in judging, namely, the\nCategories. One is inference up from experience, the other deduction\ndown from conceptual structures of the most abstract kind.\n",
