    "main_text": "God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects I: Views on Which Necessarily Existing Abstracta Are All Grounded in God || Theistic Mentalism (with Divine Simplicity)\n3.4 Theistic Mentalism (with Divine Simplicity)\n\nTheistic mentalism with divine simplicity is the view that necessarily\nexisting abstracta are identical with divine mental states, and that\nGod is simple. Because God is simple, each abstract object is\nidentical with God and thus each other. This is a view held most\nfamously by Augustine and\n Aquinas.[11]\n Because this is a mentalist view, the criticisms leveled in the\nsection on theistic mentalism without divine simplicity will apply\nhere. In addition, the person who accepts divine simplicity alongside\nher divine mentalism also will face\n criticisms of divine simplicity.\n Plantinga (1980) is perhaps the locus classicus of\ncontemporary criticism of divine simplicity. He argues that according\nto divine simplicity, God is identical with his attributes and has\n(all of) his attributes essentially. But, he argues, God isn\u2019t\nan attribute; and God has many different attributes. (For discussion\nmore sympathetic to divine simplicity, see Mann 1982; Stump and\nKretzmann 1985; Leftow 1990; Stump 1997; Wolterstorff 1991; and\nBergmann and Brower 2006.) The sorts of difficulties that Plantinga\nhas raised have seemed decisive to many. (It is beyond the scope of\nthis essay to evaluate them, however.) This isn\u2019t to say that\nthey can\u2019t be met. But the theistic mentalist who accepts divine\nsimplicity has, prima facie, a great number of difficulties\nwith her view.\n",
