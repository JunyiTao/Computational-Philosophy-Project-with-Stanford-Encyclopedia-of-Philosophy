    "main_text": "Choice Rules, or Choosing Optimally\n3. Choice Rules, or Choosing Optimally\nThere are many philosophical issues that arise in decision theory,\nbut that is not our concern here. See Joyce 2004 and reference therein\nfor discussions of the main philosophical issues. This section\nprovides enough background on decision theory to understand the key\nresults of epistemic game theory presented in the remainder of this\nentry.\nDecision rules or choice rules determine what\neach individual player will, or should do, given her preferences and\nher information in a given context. In the epistemic game theory\nliterature the most commonly used choice rules are:\n(strict) dominance, maximization of expected utility\nand admissibility (also known as weak dominance). One can do\nepistemic analysis of games using alternative choice rules, e.g.,\nminmax regret (Halpern & Pass 2011). In this entry, we focus only\non the most common ones.\nDecision theorists distinguish between choice\nunder uncertainty and choice under risk. In the\nlatter case, the decision maker has probabilistic information about\nthe possible states of the world. In the former case, there is no such\ninformation. There is an extensive literature concerning decision\nmaking in both types of situations (see Peterson 2009 for a discussion\nand pointers to the relevant literature). In the setting of epistemic\ngame theory, the appropriate notion of a \u201crational choice\u201d\ndepends on the type of game model used to describe the informational\ncontext of the game. So, in general, \u201crationality\u201d should\nbe read as following a given choice rule. The general approach is to\nstart with a definition of an irrational choice (for\ninstance, one that is strictly dominated given one\u2019s\nbeliefs), and then define rationality as not being irrational. Some\nauthors have recently looked at the consequences of lifting this\nsimplifying assumption (cf., the tripartite notion of\na categorization in Cubitt & Sugden (2011) and Pacuit\n& Roy (2011)), but the presentation of this goes beyond the scope\nof this entry.\nFinally, when the underlying notion of rationality\ngoes beyond maximization of expected utility, some authors\nhave reserved the word \u201coptimal\u201d to qualify decisions that\nmeet the latter requirement, but not necessarily the full requirements\nof rationality. See the remarks in Section\n5.2 for more on this.\n",
