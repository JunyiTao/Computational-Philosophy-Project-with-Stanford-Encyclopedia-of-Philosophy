Missing Heritability and related philosophical issues arising from GWAS\n\nThe development of alternative methods of estimating heritability\n(e.g., GWAS and SNP heritability) has given rise to what is commonly\nreferred to as the \u2018missing heritability problem\u2019, which\nhas seen ample attention by behavioral geneticists and some attention\nby philosophers of science and biology. At face value, the missing\nheritability arises out of a numerical gap between traditional\nheritability estimates and SNP-based heritability estimates of the\nsame trait. For example, traditional heritability estimates for IQ\nobtained using twin and family studies range between .5 and .7 while\nSNP-based heritability estimates of IQ are currently no greater than\n.25 (Plomin and von stumm 2018). Missing heritability is greatest\namong complex, behavioral traits.\n\nSince Maher (2008) first coined the term \u201cmissing\nheritability,\u201d statisticians and geneticists have written\nextensively about the issue. In nearly all cases, contributors speak\nto possible explanations for why there is missing heritability and\nemphasize technological and methodological solutions that should close\nthe numerical gap between traditional and SNP heritability estimates.\nExplanations for missing heritability typically focus on various\nmanners in which standard format GWAS are unable to track genetic\neffects that are unavoidably part and parcel of twin and family\nstudies. Notably, contributors appeal to non-linear interactions\nbetween genetic variants (\u2018GxG interaction\u2019, or\nepistasis). Epistatic interactions between SNPs entail that the effect\nof a given SNP will be modified (enhanced or diminished, for example)\nin the presence of another SNP, which violates the additivity\nassumption of SNP heritability. Similarly, gene-environment\ninteraction and epigenesis have been proposed as explanations for\nmissing heritability (Zuk et al. 2012). Specific variants or groups of\nvariants may have effects that are enhanced, diminished, or even muted\nwith different environments, again violating the additivity assumption\nof SNP heritability. Some missing heritability may be attributable to\nthe presenence of low-frequency, high-penetrance variants, which\nrequire massive samples to detect (Zuk et al. 2014). (See Eric\nTurkheimer (2011, 2012) and Matthews & Turkheimer (forthcoming) for a\nmore thorough review of explanations of and solutions to missing\nheritability.)\n\nThe missing heritability problem is an example of a conflict between\ntwo seemingly compatible scientific methods that give conflicting\nresults and thus has rich implications for philosophy of science. One\nof these implications is pursued by Bourrat and Lu (2017), who argue\nthat the missing heritability problem is largely\n\u2018dissolved\u2019 in two complementary steps. On the one hand,\nBourrat and Lu indicate that the numerical gap between alternative\nmethods of estimating heritability may be partially narrowed by\ndecreasing traditional estimates, which have historically been charged\nas being overestimated. On the other hand, Bourrat and Lu argue that\nthe numerical gap may be closed even more by altering SNP heritability\ntechniques so as to include non-linear and epigenetic factors that\nthey claim are currently untracked by GWAS.\n\nTo the contrary, Matthews & Turkheimer (forthcoming) argue that the\nmissing heritability problem is much more severe and prospective\ndissolutions are out of sight. Their analysis tracks the historical\nintroduction of missing heritability by Maher, who commented on a\nbroader challenge facing behavioral geneticists in the ongoing effort\nto explain, understand, and accurately predict the overwhelming\ncomplex relationships between genetic differences and complex\nbehavioral differences, such as schizophrenia, depression, and\nintelligence. Matthews & Turkheimer offer a tripartite\ncharacterization of the problem, which treats the numerical gap\nbetween traditional and SNP heritability as just one quantitative and\nindependent leg of a multi-faceted problem. On their view, the\nremaining two legs of the problem regard prediction (the challenge of\naccurately predicting complex behavioral phenotype from molecular\ngenotype) and mechanism (the challenge of elucidating meaningful\ncausal-mechanical stories that link molecular genetic differences to\ncomplex behavioral differences). Although most behavioral geneticists,\nas well as Bourrat and Liu, focus their efforts on the numerical gap\nbetween alternative methods of estimating heritability, Matthews and\nTurkheimer emphasize the fact that resolving the statistical problem\nwill not advance prediction nor explanation of the heritability of\nhuman behavior.\n\nThe development of GWAS and SNP heritability raises anew old\nphilosophical questions regarding causal relationships. Researchers in\nthe field are well aware of a handful of conceptual issues that\nprovoke skepticism regarding the question of whether or not SNPs\nidentified by GWAS are causal or not. John Dupr\u00e9 identifies\nGWAS as one among several approaches in the increasingly large effort\nto correlate genetic differences with phenotypic differences. He says\nthat GWAS \u201cuses the large amount of genetic data we now have\nabout human populations to find correlations with medical\noutcomes\u2014physiological and psychological disease\u201d (2013,\n285). Dupre goes on to say \u201cas everyone involved in such\nresearch is aware, this is hardly a search for sufficient causes. GWAS\nwill at best provide clues to the detailed causal processes involved\nin pathology\u201d (2013, 286). Some GWAS researchers are more\nbullish on causation that Dupr\u00e9 indicates (See e.g. Plomin\n2018). A well-known issue in population genetics, linkage\ndisequilibrium, occurs when there is non-random association of alleles\nat different loci. GWAS researchers acknowledge that many of the SNPs\nof interest today are in linkage with many other SNPs in the genome.\nThe implication is that it remains underdetermined whether SNPs are\ncausal variants, or merely in linkage with causal variants (perhaps\nthrough evolutionary drift).\n\nThere is also strong evidence that current GWAS are susceptible to\npopulation stratification. Because human populations exhibit ethnic or\ncultural subgroups with distinct allele frequencies, population\nstratification increases the likelihood that GWAS identify false\npositive SNPs. Not only is there evidence of population stratification\namong large groups of individuals of different biogeographic\nancestries (Europeans, Asians, Africans), but populations are\nstratified within groups as well. For example, individuals of European\ndescent would include both Parisians as well as English immigrants.\n\nWhat may be the greatest impediment to causal interpretations of SNP\nheritability is that it is biologically vacuous. SNP heritability is\nconstructed using all genetic variants included in any given SNP chip,\na significant portion of which are statistically insignificant.\nMoreover, although SNP heritability represents another figure of\nphenotypic variance \u2018explained\u2019 by genetic differences,\nSNP heritability has not led to the discovery of meaningful\nbiological stories or etiologies that would causally link patterns of\nnucleotides to patterns of complex human behaviors. Judea Pearl and\nDana MacKenzie refer to GWAS as a \u201cprototypical \u2018big\ndata\u2019 method that allows researchers to comb through the whole\ngenome statistically, looking for genes that happen to show up more in\npeople with a certain disease\u201d (2018, 339\u2013340). They go on to\nsay \u201cIt is important to notice the word\n\u2018association\u2019 in the term GWAS. This method does not prove\ncausality; it only identifies genes associated with a certain disease\nin the given sample\u201d (340). They echo our point here, in saying\nthat the methods used in GWAS hamper efforts at making causal\ninferences.\n",
