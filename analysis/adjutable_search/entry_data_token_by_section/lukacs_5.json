History and Class Consciousness\n\nNot only did Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s 1918 conversion to communism and his\nsubsequent engagement with philosophical Marxism confound his friends,\nbut even today\u2019s readers can find it difficult to track the many\nshifts in Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s theoretical commitments between 1918 and\n1923.\n\nIn the December 1918 article \u201cBolshevism as an Ethical\nProblem,\u201d Luk\u00e1cs draws a connection between his newfound\nMarxist convictions and his previous ethical views: whereas the\nhistorical necessity of class struggle is only a descriptive\nclaim in Marxism, the normative, ethical requirement to\nestablish a classless society must be separated from issues of truth\nand recognized as a utopian form of ethical idealism, appropriate for\nthe expression of a pure will. In 1918, Luk\u00e1cs still thought\nthat this insight led to a paradox: In order for the proletarian\n\u201cmessianic class\u201d (1918: 218) to overcome class society,\nit must first seize power by creating the most extreme form of class\ndominance, i.e., a dictatorship. Bolshevism thus presupposes that evil\nactions can produce good outcomes, or, as Luk\u00e1cs puts it in the\nessay \u201cTactics and Ethics,\u201d that tragedy cannot be avoided\nin revolutionary politics (1919a: 10). By the time History and\nClass Consciousness appeared, however, Luk\u00e1cs seems to\nhave thought of himself as having found another conception of\nrevolutionary action that paved the way for a new approach to\npolitical practice.\n",
