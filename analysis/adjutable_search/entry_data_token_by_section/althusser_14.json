It\nwas excerpted from a larger essay titled \u201cOn the Reproduction of\nCapitalism.\u201d This work analyzed the necessary relationship\nbetween state and subject such that a given economic mode of\nproduction might subsist. It includes not only an analysis of the\nstate and its legal and educational systems but also of the\npsychological relationship which exists between subject and state as\nideology. This narrative of subjectification was intended to help\nadvance Althusser\u2019s argument that regimes or states are able to\nmaintain control by reproducing subjects who believe that their\nposition within the social structure is a natural one. Ideology, or\nthe background ideas that we possess about the way in which the world\nmust function and of how we function within it is, in this account,\nunderstood to be always present. Specific socio-economic structures,\nhowever, require particular ideologies. These ideologies are\ninstantiated by institutions or \u201cIdeological State\nApparatuses\u201d like family, schools, church, etc., which provide\nthe developing subject with categories in which she can recognize\nherself. Inasmuch as a person does so and embraces the practices\nassociated with those institutions, she has been successfully\n\u201chailed\u201d or \u201cinterpellated\u201d and recognized\nherself as that subject who does those kinds of things. As the effect\nof these recognitions is to continue existing social relations,\nAlthusser argued that a Dictatorship of the Proletariat is necessary\nso that Ideological State Apparatuses productive of the bourgeois\nsubject can be replaced with those productive of proletarian or\ncommunist subjects.\n 4.3 Aesthetic Theory\n\nAlthusser\u2019s engagement with aesthetic theory was not nearly\nso consistent as those with philosophy of science and social\nphilosophy. However, dramaturgical speculations from the\nearly 1960s were crucial to the development of his method of\nsymptomatic reading and forays into the criticism of\nvisual art beginning in the mid-1960s likewise proved of decisive\nimportance for the development of his theory of ideology. In\nparticular, Althusser\u2019s Brechtian musings on aesthetics\nprovide partial answers to the question of how criticism\nof ideological notions of the real as well as the\ndevelopment of revolutionary strategy is possible. Althusser does\nnot argue that art provides a glimpse of actual social conditions\nunfiltered by ideology. Indeed, he argues that art mostly\nreproduces ideology. Further, there is no formal way\nto distinguish between a work of art and other cultural\nproductions like advertising. A person can \u201csees\nherself\u201d in a pick-up truck advertisement as easily as a\nsubject can mis-recognize herself as the subject of a drama.\nHowever, some art, that which Althusser\ndeems \u201cauthentic\u201d (1996a), troubles a subject\u2019s\nusual relationship between herself and the world. This habitual\nrelation is one where the world is always seen to conform to and\nto confirm the subject\u2019s view of \u201cthe way\nthings are\u201d. Authentic art though makes felt or known the\ndistance between the real world and a subject\u2019s\nhabitual ideological view of it. In this moment, the space for\ncriticism, investigation, and, perhaps, the possibility for\nacting to change the world is inaugurated.\n\n\n",
