    "main_text": "\n\nSpinoza\u2019s epistemology and philosophy of mind are governed by\nsome rather unintuitive commitments: first, a commitment to universal\nintelligibility, often described as Spinoza\u2019s version of what,\nwith Leibniz, came to be known as the Principle of Sufficient Reason\n(PSR); second, a commitment to the explanatory closure of the mental\nand the physical; third, a commitment to the explanatory and\nontological priority of an infinite thinker over any finite mind. The\nentry discusses these commitments before diving into the details of\nSpinoza\u2019s theories of cognition and mindedness. (In line with\nSpinoza\u2019s own practice, what follows treats\n\u201cconceive\u201d, \u201cunderstand\u201d, \u201cthink\u201d,\n\u201cexplain\u201d, and \u201ccognize\u201d as roughly\ninterchangeable [cf. Wilson 1999: ch.10; Della Rocca 1996].)\n",
