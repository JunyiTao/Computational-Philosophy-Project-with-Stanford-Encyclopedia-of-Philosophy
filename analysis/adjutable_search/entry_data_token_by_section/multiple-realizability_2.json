Functionalism in the philosophy of mind\nindividuates mental states in terms of their causes and effects. Pain,\nfor example, is caused by tissue damage or trauma to bodily regions,\nand in turn causes specific beliefs (e.g., that one is in pain),\ndesires (e.g., that one relieves the pain), and behaviors such as\ncrying out, nursing the damaged area, and seeking out pain relieving\ndrugs. Any internal state that mediates a similar pattern of causes\nand effects is of the mental type pain, regardless of the specific\nphysical mechanisms that realize that pattern of causes and effects in\nany given case. Ned Block and Jerry Fodor (1972) note that the\nmultiple realizability of mental types on physical types shows that\nany physicalist type-identity hypothesis will fail to be sufficiently\nabstract. Functionalism, on the other hand, seems to be at the correct\nlevel of abstraction up from explanations of behavior based on\nphysical mechanisms. In particular, it seems sufficiently abstract to\nhandle multiple realizability. Block and Fodor (1972) also note that\nmultiple realizability at the level of physical description is a\ncommon characteristic of ordinary functional kinds, like mousetraps\nand valve lifters. So it appears to be a reasonable empirical\nhypothesis that characterizing mental kinds as functional kinds is at\nthe correct level of abstraction.\n\nSome contemporary nonreductive physicalists deny that mental kinds are\ncorrectly identified with functional kinds. A popular criticism of\nthis sort hinges on issues about individualism in psychology. But\nPutnam later used multiple realizability itself to argue against\nfunctionalism, arguing that mental kinds are both\n\u201ccompositionally\u201d and \u201ccomputationally\u201d\nplastic. The first point is his familiar contention of the multiple\nrealizability of the mental on the physical. The second contends that\nthe same mental kind can be a property of systems that are not in the\nsame computational state (see Putnam 1988 for details). In this\nargument, multiple realizability strikes back against the very theory\nof mind it initially was used to defend. \n",
