    "main_text": "Building on Hume || Neo-Humeanism: The As-if Theory\n4.3 Neo-Humeanism: The As-if Theory\n\nPrice offers two general approaches to neo-Humeans. The first he calls\nthe \u201cAs-If\u201d Theory (1940a: ch. 5; also 1930b:\n192\u2013195). The central idea is that a judgement of the form\n\u201cit is as if p\u201d can be true even if\n\u201cp\u201d is not true. One could say of a man who looked\nvery tired, \u201che is as if he had trained for two hours\u201d,\neven if he had not. For material object discourse, the proposal\nbecomes: if someone says, \u201cThere is a table\u201d, they are to\nbe treated as saying \u201cMy current sensibilia is as if there is a\ntable\u201d.\n\nIn Price\u2019s view, Hume tried but failed to show that \u201cthere\nis a table\u201d is false. Hume, being an empiricist, should have\nheld that there is no way to determine whether (or not) there is a\ntable, which Price says is equivalent to claiming that the words\n\u201cThere is a table\u201d are \u201cmeaningless\u201d (1940a:\n143). So the theory should be that although \u201cthere is a\ntable\u201d is strictly meaningless, the claim \u201cit is as if\nthere is a table\u201d is not meaningless, and is, according to the\nas-if theory, what our statement \u201cthere is a table\u201d in\neffect means. One might wonder how a meaningless sentence can be\nembedded in a meaningful complex sentence, but Price clarifies this:\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d simply means \u201cnot confirmable or\ndisconfirmable\u201d (1940a: 148\u2013150).\n\nAccording to this account, our ordinary thought about the surrounding\nworld amounts to the following: We sense various sensibilia, which\ngiven our imaginative propensities makes us envisage continuous and\nvaried streams of unsensed sensibilia which would amount to the\npresence of objects. And we describe things in terms of it being as if\nthese streams occurred although we are not committing to their\nactually having occurred. This practice allows us to anticipate future\nexperiences.\n\nHe interestingly argues that the as-if approach has advantages over\nphenomenalism (1940a: 177\u2013192). First, phenomenalism treats the\npresence of an object as the truth of a counterfactual conditional,\nwhereas in ordinary thought the presence of an object amounts to a\nthing\u2019s real existence (1940a: 177ff). On the as-if approach,\nwhen someone understands a material object claim they envisage the\nsequences of sensibilia their experiences lead them to think of. Price\nthinks this fits ordinary thought better. It builds into ordinary\nunderstanding an envisaging of more than counterfactual conditionals.\nHowever, the whole point of calling it \u201cas-if\u201d-envisaging\nis to treat ordinary talk non-seriously. Where that leaves the\nsupposed advantage is unclear.\n",
