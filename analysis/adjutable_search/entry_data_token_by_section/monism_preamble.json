    "main_text": "\n\nThere are many monisms. What they share is that they attribute\noneness. Where they differ is in what they target\nand how they count.\n\nThis entry focuses on two of the more historically important monisms:\nexistence monism and priority monism. Existence\nmonism targets concrete objects and counts by tokens. This is the\ndoctrine that exactly one concrete object token exists. Priority\nmonism also targets concrete objects but counts by basic tokens. This\nis the doctrine that exactly one concrete object token is basic, and\nis equivalent to the classical doctrine that the whole is prior to its\n(proper) parts.\n\nFor roughly a century, neither existence nor priority monism was\naccorded much respect, nor were they even properly distinguished.\nIndeed, the tradition associated with these doctrines was long\ndismissed as being somewhere between obscure and ridiculous. But\nattitudes have evolved, because there are serious arguments for such\nmonisms. Priority monism may especially deserve serious\nreconsideration.\n\nThough this entry will focus on existence monism and priority monism,\nthere are of course other historically important monisms, including\nsubstance monism. Substance monism targets concrete objects\nand counts by highest types. This is the doctrine that all concrete\nobjects fall under one highest type (perhaps material, or mental, or\nsome neutral underlying type: here the way divides). This topic is\ncovered elsewhere in the encyclopedia (Robinson 2011).\n",
