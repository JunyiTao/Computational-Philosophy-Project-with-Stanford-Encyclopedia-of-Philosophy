    "main_text": "Alethic pluralism about truth: a plurality of properties || Strength\n1.1 Strength\n\n\nThe pluralist\u2019s thesis that there are many ways of being true\nis typically construed as being tantamount to the claim that the number\nof truth properties is greater than one. However, this basic\ninterpretation,\n\n(1) there is more than one truth property.\n\n\n\nis compatible with both moderate as well as more radical\nprecisifications. According to moderate pluralism, at least one way of\nbeing true among the multitude of others is universally shared:\n\n(2) there is more than one truth property, some of which are had by\nall true sentences.\n\n\n\nAccording to strong pluralism, however, there is no such universal\nor common way of being true:\n\n(3) there is more than one truth property, none of which is had by\nall true sentences.\n\n\n\nPrecisifying pluralism about truth in these two ways brings several\nconsequences to the fore. Firstly, both versions of pluralism conflict\nwith strong monism about truth:\n\n(4) there is exactly one truth property, which is had by all true\nsentences.\n\n\n\nSecondly, moderate\u2014but not strong\u2014pluralism is\ncompatible with a moderate version of monism about truth:\n\n(5) there is one truth property, which is had by all true\nsentences.\n\n\n\n(2) and (5) are compatible because (5) does not rule out the\npossibility that the truth property had by all true sentences might be\none among the multitude of truth properties endorsed by the moderate\npluralist (i.e., by someone who endorses (2)). Only strong pluralism in\n(3) entails the denial of the claim that all true sentences are true in\nthe same way. Thus, moderate pluralists and moderate monists\ncan in principle find common ground.\n",
