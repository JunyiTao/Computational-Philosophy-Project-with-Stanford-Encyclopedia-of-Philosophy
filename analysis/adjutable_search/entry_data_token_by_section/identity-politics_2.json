    "main_text": "Liberalism and Identity Politics\n3. Liberalism and Identity Politics\n\nInstitutionalized liberal democracy is a key condition of\npossibility for contemporary identity politics. The citizen\nmobilizations that made democracy real also shaped and unified groups\npreviously marginal to the polity, while extensions of formal rights\ninvited expectations of material and symbolic equality. The perceived\npaucity of rewards offered by liberal capitalism, however, spurred\nforms of radical critique that sought to explain the persistence of\ninequity. At the most basic philosophical level, critics of liberalism\nsuggested that liberal social ontology\u2014the model of the nature of\nand relationship between subjects and collectives\u2014was misguided.\nThe social ontology of most liberal political theories consists of\ncitizens conceptualized as essentially similar individuals, as for\nexample in John Rawls\u2019 famous thought experiment using the\n\u201coriginal position,\u201d in which representatives of the\ncitizenry are conceptually divested of all specific identities or\naffiliations in order to make rational decisions about the social\ncontract (Rawls 1971). To the extent that group interests are\nrepresented in liberal polities, they tend to be understood as\nassociational, forms of interest group pluralism whereby those sharing\nparticular interests voluntarily join together to create a political\nlobby. Citizens are free to register their individual preferences\n(through voting, for example), or to aggregate themselves for the\nopportunity to lobby more systematically (e.g., by forming an\nassociation such as a neighborhood community league). These lobbies,\nhowever, are not defined by the identity of their members so much as by\nspecific shared interests and goals, and when pressing their case the\nmarginalized subjectivity of the group members is not itself called\ninto question. Finally, political parties, the other primary organs of\nliberal democratic government, critics suggest, have few moments of\ninclusivity, being organized around party discipline, responsiveness to\nlobby groups, and broad-based electoral popularity. Ultimately\nconventional liberal democracy, diverse radical critics claim, cannot\neffectively address the ongoing structural marginalization that\npersists in late capitalist liberal states, and may even be complicit\nwith it (Young 1990; P. Williams 1991; Brown 1995; M. Williams 1998;\nMills 2017).\n\nOn a philosophical level, liberal understandings of the political\nsubject and its relationship to collectivity came to seem inadequate to\nensuring representation for women, gay men and lesbians, or racial-ethnic\ngroups (M. Williams 1998). Critics charged that the neutral citizen of\nliberal theory was in fact the bearer of an identity coded white, male,\nbourgeois, able, and heterosexual (Pateman 1988; Young 1990; Di Stefano\n1991; Mills 1997; Pateman and Mills 2007). This implicit ontology in\npart explained the persistent historical failure of liberal democracies\nto achieve full inclusion in power structures for members of\nmarginalized groups. A richer understanding of political subjects as\nconstituted through and by their social location was required. In\nparticular, the history and experience of injustice brought with it\ncertain perspectives and needs that could not be assimilated through\nexisting institutions. Individuals are oppressed by virtue of their\nmembership in a particular social group\u2014that is, a\ncollective whose members have relatively little mobility into or out of\nthe collective, who usually experience their membership as involuntary,\nwho are generally identified as members by others, and whose\nopportunities are deeply shaped by the relation of their group to\ncorollary groups through privilege and oppression (Cudd 2006). Liberal\ndemocratic institutions have persistently grappled with the challenge\nof recognizing such asymmetries of identity while stressing procedural\nconsistency and literal equality in institutions. Thus for example the\ntwentieth-century U.S. discussion of the categories of race organized\naround color-blind versus color-conscious public policy (Appiah and\nGutmann 1996). Color-blindness\u2014that is, the view that\nrace should be ignored in public policy and everyday\nexchange\u2014had hegemony in popular discourse. Drawing attention to\nrace\u2014whether in a personal description or in university\nadmissions procedures\u2014was characterized as unfair and racist.\nAdvocates of color-consciousness, on the other hand, argued that racism\nwould not disappear without proactive efforts, which required the\ninvocation of race. Affirmative action requires statistics about the\nnumbers of members of oppressed racial groups employed in certain\ncontexts, which in turn requires racial identification and\ncategorization. Thus those working against racism face a paradox\nfamiliar in identity politics: the very identity they aim to transform\nmust be invoked to make their case.\n\nCritics have also charged that integration (or,\nmore provocatively, assimilation) is a guiding principle of liberalism\n(see Callan 2005). If the liberal subject is coded in the way Young\n(1990) suggests, then attempts to apply liberal norms of equality will\nrisk demanding that the marginalized conform to the identities of their\noppressors. For example, many commentators on the politics of gender\nand sexuality objected to campaigns defending \u201cgay\nmarriage\u201d or otherwise representing queer people as living up to\nheterosexual (white, or middle-class) norms, on the grounds that these\nlegal developments assimilate same-sex relationships to an existing\ndominant model, rather than challenging its historical, material, and\nsymbolic terms (e.g., Card 2007; Puar 2017). If this\nis equality, they claim, then it looks suspiciously like\nthe erasure of socially subordinate identities rather than their\ngenuine incorporation into the polity. One of the central charges\nagainst identity politics by liberals, among others, has been its\nalleged reliance on notions of sameness to justify political\nmobilization. Looking for people who are like you rather\nthan who share your political values as allies runs the risk of\nsidelining critical political analysis of complex social locations and\nghettoizing members of social groups as the only persons capable of\nmaking or understanding claims to justice. After an initial wave of\nrelatively uncompromising identity politics, proponents have taken\nthese criticisms to heart and moved to more philosophically nuanced\naccounts that appeal to coalitions as better\norganizing structures. On this view, separatism around a single\nidentity formation must be muted by recognition of the intersectional\nnature of social group memberships. The idea of a dominant identity\nfrom which the oppressed may need to dissociate themselves remains, but\nthe alternative becomes a more fluid and diverse grouping, less intent\non guarantees of internal homogeneity.\n\nFinally, the literature on multiculturalism takes up questions of\nrace, ethnicity, and cultural diversity in relation to the liberal\nstate (Levy 2000; Kymlicka 2001). Some multicultural\nstates\u2014notably Canada\u2014allegedly aim to permit the various\ncultural identities of their residents to be preserved rather than\nassimilated, despite the concern that the over-arching liberal aims of\nsuch states may be at odds with the values of those they claim to\nprotect. For example, Susan Moller Okin argued that multiculturalism is\nsometimes \u201cbad for women,\u201d especially when it works to\npreserve patriarchal values in minority cultures. If multiculturalism\nimplies a form of cultural relativism that prevents judgment of or\ninterference with the \u201cprivate\u201d practices of minorities,\nfemale genital mutilation, forced marriage, compulsory veiling, or\nbeing deprived of education may be the consequence. Okin\u2019s\ncritics countered that she falsely portrayed culture as static,\ninternally homogeneous, and defined by men\u2019s values, allowing\nliberalism to represent a culturally unmarked medium for the defense of\nindividual rights (Okin et al. 1999). For many commentators on\nmulticulturalism this is the nub of the issue: is there an\ninconsistency between defending the rights of minority cultures, while\nprohibiting those (allegedly) cultural practices that the state judges\nilliberal (Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005; Phillips 2007)? Can\nliberalism sustain the cultural and value-neutrality that some\ncommentators still ascribe to it, or to what extent should it embrace\nits own cultural specificity (Taylor 1994; Foster and Herzog 1994;\nKymlicka 1995)? Defenders of the right to cultural expression of\nminorities in multicultural states thus practice forms of identity\npolitics that are both made possible by liberalism and sometimes in\ntension with it (see Laden and Owen 2007). Increasingly it is difficult\nto see what divides anything called \u201cliberalism\u201d from\nanything called \u201cidentity politics,\u201d and some commentators\nhave suggested possible rapprochements (e.g., Laden\n2001).\n",
