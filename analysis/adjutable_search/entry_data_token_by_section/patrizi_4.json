    "main_text": "Use of Pre-Platonic Sources\n5. The Relation of Philosophy to Science\n\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Francesco Patrizi's\nheritage as a forebear of early modern science and philosophy is his\nongoing attempt in his major works to incorporate a systematic account\nof the natural world within an overall methodological and metaphysical\ncontext, anticipating by doing so some of the defining characteristics\nof such thinkers as Galileo, Descartes and Leibniz. Perhaps\nnowhere is this more clearly displayed than in his later writings,\nespecially the Pancosmia section of the Nova \u2026\nPhilosophia and in his discussion of mathematical and physical\nspace (Brickman, tr. 1943; Vedrine, ed. 1996).\n\n\nIn the Pancosmia Patrizi is intent upon replacing the four\nAristotelian elements with his own alternatives \u2013 space, light,\nheat and humidity. Space (spatium) is viewed as\npreferable to the Aristotelian conception of \u201cplace\u201d,\nconstrued as the inner surface of the body surrounding any\nobject. Patrizi elevates the notion of space to make it the first\nprinciple of the corporeal world. Space is construed as prior to\nall bodies, even light, and constitutes two distinct realms. \nMundane space is finite in extent and contains the physical\ncosmos. It is surrounded in turn by an infinite external space\nempty of all bodies. The universe consists of three separate\nworlds: the \u201cEmpyrean\u201d, an infinite space filled with\nlight; the \u201cAetheric\u201d, which contains all the stars and\nother heavenly bodies down to the Moon; and the\n\u201cElementary\u201d, which embraces the sublunar realm. \nPatrizi holds that the stars and planets move freely through the\naether, doing away with the fixed celestial spheres which had\ndominated cosmology from antiquity and had even been accepted by\nCopernicus. \n\n\nOne can easily see numerous sources in the history of science which\nmay have influenced Patrizi's conception of the universe. \nThe infinity of space and the existence of a vacuum were maintained by\nthe ancient atomists, and, as noted, the centrality of light as an\nintermediary level between the corporeal and incorporeal has solid\nroots in the Platonic tradition. In some ways Patrizi's\ncosmology may well reveal the influence of similar attacks on the\nAristotelian position put forward by his contemporary and\ncorrespondent, Bernardino Telesio of Cosenza. But it is equally\nclear that his system represents his own unique blend of metaphysics\nand physics. He does not embrace a Brunonian schema which couples\nthe notion of an infinite universe with that of an infinite number of\nworld-systems spread throughout it.  Patrizi's universe is\nstill geocentric, though it places the Earth at the center of an\ninfinite expanse of light-filled space beyond the material realm. \nAnd although it rejects the Sun-centered universe, it does accept the\nEarth's diurnal rotation. An innovative production, it\ncould hardly help but influence later theories (Filippona La Bruna\n1965; Grant 1981; Petkovi\u0107 2002).\n\n\nAnother fundamental distinction Patrizi introduces is that between\nmathematical and physical space, a view which will have profound import\nfor the main figures identified with early modern thought, such as\nGalileo, Kepler, Newton, Descartes and Leibniz. In\nPatrizi's system, mathematical space is a pure reality,\nontologically prior to all bodies; its primary unit is the geometrical\npoint. Physical space, on the other hand, contains bodies, which\nare not purely three-dimensional geometrical forms, but provide the\nadditional factor of resistance, a view which can be seen as\nanticipating Leibniz's addition of the notion of force to\nDescartes' conception of bodies as geometrically definable\n(Kristeller 1964, 123). Thus Patrizi can be counted among the\nRenaissance thinkers such as Jacopo Mazzoni, Galileo's mentor at\nthe University of Pisa, who posited mathematics as prior to physics and\nquite probably opened the doors to the mathematized physics which would\ncome to dominate early modern science (Purnell 1972; Wallace\n1998). Yet for Patrizi it is geometry which is the most valuable\ntool for the study of the physical world, not arithmetic. Perhaps\noddly for someone with a background so deeply rooted in Platonism,\nPatrizi considered numbers to be merely products of thought, not\nconstitutive or revelatory of the ultimate character of the natural\nworld. Perhaps it would take the development of analytic geometry\nto alter such a view in due course. \n\n\nAlthough space was put forward as the main principle of the\nphysical, the three derivative principles also play important roles in\nPatrizi's model. The primary occupant of space is light;\nfrom it in turn heat is produced, which is construed as a formal and\nactive principle. It is probably no coincidence that heat had\nbeen one of the three basic principles underlying his colleague\nTelesio's system of nature, together with cold and matter,\nalthough Telesio's was a qualitative rather than quantifiable\nuniverse, as Patrizi's would be. The final constituent of\nPatrizi's physics is humidity (fluor), which is passive\nand material and somewhat akin to the elements associated with\npre-Socratic thinkers such as Empedocles.\n\n\nIn sum, then, given the innovative, retrospective, Platonic and\nAristotelian/anti-Aristotelian aspects of Patrizi's thought, what\nis the best way to \u201ccategorize\u201d him as a Renaissance\nphilosopher?  Humanist, scientist, mathematician, literary critic\nand poet, historian, engineer and utopian theorist, it is hard to find\none category which fills the bill. Perhaps there is a message\nhere, not just about Francesco Patrizi of Cherso but about many\nRenaissance thinkers of his day. Confronted by so many models\nfrom previous ages and seeking to discover the best means to move into\nthe future, it is hardly surprising that many of the most open-minded\nthinkers of the time can best be viewed more appropriately as\ntransitional figures, rather than Platonists, Aristotelians or\n\u201cphilosophers of nature\u201d as many have been claimed to have\nbeen. For example, to characterize Patrizi as a\n\u201cRenaissance Platonist\u201d with such thinkers as Marsilio\nFicino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola is to ignore or understate the\nsignificant differences among them. And to see him as a\n\u201cphilosopher of nature\u201d with such contemporaries as\nBernardino Telesio and Giordano Bruno hardly fits as well. That\nhe should be so hard to define \u2013 both looking back and looking\nforward \u2013 should not disturb us. He was, after all, a\n\u201cRenaissance\u201d thinker, helping to usher in a new age.\n",
