    "main_text": "Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre || Philosophy of Religion\n5. The later Wissenschaftslehre and the Reception of Fichte\u2019s Philosophy\n\nFor much of the nineteenth century, beginning with Hegel\u2019s\nself-serving interpretation of the history of modern philosophy,\nFichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre was generally assimilated\ninto the larger history of German idealism. Criticized by both\nSchelling and Hegel as a one-sided, \u201csubjective\u201d idealism\nand a prime instance of the \u201cphilosophy of reflection,\u201d\nFichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre was almost universally\ntreated as a superseded rung on the ladder \u201cfrom Kant to\nHegel\u201d and thus assigned a purely historical significance.\nNeglected as the Wissenschaftslehre may have been during this\nperiod, Fichte was not entirely forgotten, but remained influential as\nthe author of the Addresses to the German Nation and was\nalternately hailed and vilified as one of the founders of modern\npan-German nationalism.\n\nThis same situation prevailed throughout much of the twentieth century\nas well, during which Fichte\u2019s fortune seemed closely tied to\nthat of Germany. Particularly during the long periods preceding,\nduring, and following the two World Wars, Fichte was discussed almost\nexclusively in the context of German politics and national identity,\nand his technical philosophy tended to be dismissed as a monstrous or\ncomical speculative aberration of no relevance whatsoever to\ncontemporary philosophy. There were, to be sure, isolated exceptions\nand authors such as Fritz Medicus, Martial Gueroult, Xavier\nL\u00e9on, and Max Wundt who, during the first half of the twentieth\ncentury, took Fichte seriously as a philosopher and made lasting\ncontributions to the study of his thought. But the real boom in Fichte\nstudies has come only in the past six decades, during which the\nWissenschaftslehre has once again become the object of\nintense philosophical scrutiny and lively, world-wide\ndiscussion\u2014as is evidenced by the establishment of large and\nactive professional societies devoted to Fichte in Europe, Japan, and\nNorth America.\n\nJ. H. Stirling once quipped that \u201cFichte had two\nphilosophical epochs; and if both belong to biography, only one\nbelongs to history,\u201d and until quite recently there was a great\ndeal of truth to this observation. Indeed, even today, Fichte\u2019s\ntechnical writings of the post-Jena period remain little-known to the\nvast majority of philosophers. Admittedly, it is hard to recognize\nthese late texts\u2014which drop the strategy of beginning with an\nanalysis of the self, along with the strong emphasis upon the\n\u201cprimacy of the practical,\u201d and which include\nunembarrassed references to an apparently transcendent\n\u201cabsolute\u201d (\u201cBeing,\u201d \u201cAbsolute\nBeing,\u201d \u201cGod\u201d)\u2014as the work of the same author\nwho wrote the Foundations of the Entire Wissenschaftslehre.\nThough Fichte himself always insisted that his basic philosophy\nremained the same, no matter how much his presentation thereof may\nhave altered over the years, many sympathetic readers and not a few\nwell-informed scholars have found it impossible to reconcile this\nclaim with what at least appear to be the profound systematic and\ndoctrinal differences between the \u201cearly\u201d and\n\u201clate\u201d Wissenschaftslehre. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the problematic \u201cunity\u201d of Fichte\u2019s\nthought continues to be vigorously debated by experts in the\nfield.\n\nWhatever one may conclude concerning the relationship between\nFichte\u2019s earlier and later writings, it is certainly the case\nthat, with the publication of numerous, faithfully edited\n\u201cnew\u201d manuscripts of later versions of the\nWissenschaftslehre, the focus of much of the best\ncontemporary Fichte scholarship has shifted to his later texts, most\nof which were entirely unknown to earlier generations of readers.\nSeldom has a new edition of a philosopher\u2019s literary corpus had\na greater effect upon the contemporary reputation of the thinker in\nquestion or a more stimulating effect upon contemporary scholarship\nthan in the case of the monumental new critical edition of\nFichte\u2019s works begun in the early nineteen-sixties under the\nauspices of the Bavarian Academy of the Sciences and the general\neditorship of Reinhard Lauth and others. Now complete, this edition\nhas contributed directly and enormously to the contemporary revival of\ninterest in Fichte\u2019s philosophy in general, and in the later\nversions of the Wissenschaftslehre in particular. Much of the\nbest recent work on Fichte, particularly in Germany, Italy, and Japan,\nhas been devoted exclusively to his later thought. Stirling\u2019s\nobservation is thus no longer true, inasmuch as the work of\nFichte\u2019s \u201csecond epoch\u201d has, however belatedly, now\nbecome the object of genuine and lively philosophical discussion and\ndispute.\n\nIn contrast, anglophone Fichte scholarship, which has also experienced\nquite a renaissance of its own over the past few decades, has remained\nlargely focused upon the \u201cclassical\u201d texts of the Jena\nperiod. This is no doubt due, in large part at least, to the\nappearance, during these same decades, of new, reliable translations\nof almost all of Fichte\u2019s early writings and the lack of\ntranslations of his later, unpublished texts. But it is also a\nreflection of the relatively anemic tradition of Fichte scholarship in\nEngland and North America, where even the early\nWissenschaftslehre has long been neglected and\nunder-appreciated. Until quite recently, virtually no scholars writing\nin English were interested in examining the\nWissenschaftslehre in its own right, but were mainly\nconcerned to determine Fichte\u2019s position in relationship to\nKant\u2019s or Hegel\u2019s. This situation, however, has\nfundamentally altered, and some of the most insightful and original\ncurrent work on Fichte is being done in English. The recent\npublication of an English translation of the Fichte\u2019s second\nseries of lectures on the Wissenschaftslehr from 1804\nsuggests that anglophone Fichte scholarship is at least ready to begin\ncoming to terms with Fichte\u2019s later philosophy.\n",
