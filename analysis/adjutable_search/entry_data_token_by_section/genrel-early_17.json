In December 1921, the Berlin Academy\npublished Theodore Kaluza\u2019s novel proposal for unification of\ngravitation and electromagnetism upon the basis of a five-dimensional\nRiemannian geometry. But earlier that year, in February, came Arthur\nStanley Eddington\u2019s further generalization of Weyl\u2019s\nfour-dimensional geometry, wherein the sole primitive geometrical\nnotion is the non-metrical comparison of direction or orientation at\nthe same or neighboring points. In Weyl\u2019s geometry the magnitude\nof vectors at the same point, but pointing in different directions,\nmight be directly compared to one another; in Eddington\u2019s,\ncomparison was immediate only for vectors pointing in the same\ndirection. His \u201ctheory of the affine field\u201d encompassed\nboth Weyl\u2019s geometry and the semi-Riemannian geometry of\nEinstein\u2019s general relativity as special cases. Little attention\nwas paid however, to Eddington\u2019s claim, prefacing his paper,\nthat his objective had not been to \u201cseek (the) unknown laws (of\nmatter)\u201d as befits a unified field theory. Rather it lay\n\u201cin consolidating the known (field) laws\u201d wherein\n\u201cthe whole scheme seems simplified, and new light is thrown on\nthe origin of the fundamental laws of physics\u201d (1921: 105).\n\nEddington was persuaded that Weyl\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nrelativity of length\u201d was \u201can essential part of the\nrelativistic conception\u201d, a view he retained to the end of his\nlife (e.g., 1939: 28). But he was also convinced that the largely\nantagonistic reception accorded Weyl\u2019s theory was due to its\nconfusing formulation. The flaw lay in Weyl\u2019s failure to make\ntransparently obvious that the locally scale invariant (\u201cpure\ninfinitesimal\u201d) \u201cworld geometry\u201d was not the\nphysical geometry of actual spacetime, but an entirely mathematical\nconstruct inherently serving to specify the ideal of an\nobserver-independent external world. To remedy this, Eddington devised\na general method of deductive presentation of field physics in which\n\u201cworld geometry\u201d is developed mathematically as\nconceptually separate from physics. A \u201cworld geometry\u201d is\na purely mathematical construction the derived objects of which\npossess only structural properties requisite to the ideal of a\ncompletely impersonal world; these are objects, as he wrote in\nSpace, Time and Gravitation (1920), a semi-popular\nbest-seller, represented \u201cfrom the point of view of no one in\nparticular\u201d. Naturally, this ideal had changed with the progress\nof physical theory. In the light of relativity theory, such a world is\nindifferent to specification of reference frame and, after Weyl, of\ngauge of length (scale). A world geometry is not the physical theory\nof such a world but a framework or \u201cgraphical\nrepresentation\u201d within whose terms existing physical theory\nmight be displayed, essentially through a purely formal identification\nof known tensors of the existing physical laws of gravitation and\nelectromagnetism with those derived within the world geometry. Such a\ngeometrical representation of physics cannot really be said to be\nright or wrong, for it only implements, if it can, current ideas\ngoverning the conception of objects and properties of an impersonal\nobjective external world. But when existing physics, in particular,\nEinstein\u2019s theory of gravitation, is set in the context of\nEddington\u2019s world geometry, it yields a surprising consequence:\nThe Einstein law of gravitation appears as a definition! In the form\n\\(R_{\\mu\\nu} = 0\\) it defines what in the \u201cworld geometry\u201d\nappears to the mind as \u201cvacuum\u201d while in the form of the\nEinstein field equation noted above, it defines what is to be\nencountered by the mind as \u201cmatter\u201d. This result is what\nis meant by his stated claim of throwing \u201cnew light on the\norigin of the fundamental laws of physics\u201d (see Ryckman 2005:\nchapters 7 & 8). Eddington\u2019s notoriously difficult and\nopaque later works (1936, 1946), took their inspiration from this\nargumentation in attempting to carry out a similar, algebraic not\ngeometric, program of deriving fundamental physical laws, and the\nconstants occurring in them, from a priori epistemological\nprinciples.\n",
