    "main_text": "Practical reason: morality and the primacy of pure practical reason || Moral constraint implies freedom: Kant\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d\n2.2 Moral constraint implies freedom: Kant\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d\n\nAs well as claiming that freedom implies the Categorical Imperative,\nKant claims that moral obligation implies freedom.\n\nKant insists that \u201cnothing in appearances can be explained by\nthe concept of freedom\u201d (5:30). Morality, he claims,\n\u201cexists in the sensible world [the world as known through the\nsenses and by science] but without infringing on its laws\u201d\n(5:43). Every action counts as an event in the world of everyday\nobjects (or \u201cappearances,\u201d in Kant\u2019s terminology).\nWe must take every event to be caused\u2014in terms of everyday\nexplanations as well as in sciences such as physics and neuroscience.\nConsidered as events in the objective world, human actions do\nnot provide us with a warrant for freedom.\n\nInstead, it is to our consciousness or subjectivity that Kant\nturns:\n\nAsk [someone] whether, if his prince demanded, on pain of\u2026\nimmediate execution, that he give false testimony against an honorable\nman who the prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext, he\nwould consider it possible to overcome his love of life\u2026 He\nwould perhaps not venture to assert whether he would do it or not, but\nhe must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for him. He\njudges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware that\nhe ought to do it and cognizes freedom within him, which, without the\nmoral law, would have remained unknown to him. (5:30; cf. 5:155f)\n\n\nAs Kant also says, \u201cthe moral law, and with it practical reason,\n[have] come in and forced this concept [freedom] upon us\u201d\n(5:30). In the next section, Kant refers to this as a \u201cfact of\nreason\u201d: \u201cConsciousness of this fundamental law may be\ncalled a fact of reason because one cannot reason it out from\nantecedent data of reason\u201d (5:31; cf. 5: 6, 42f, 47, 55, 91,\n104).\n\nThis \u201cfact\u201d has caused considerable controversy, for\nseveral reasons. Kant is not altogether clear about what he takes this\nfact to demonstrate. He has argued that facts about human beings\ncannot provide the basis for morality\u2014morality must be given a\npriori, that is, independently of experience. Further, Kant speaks of\n\u201ccognizing the moral law.\u201d But he is well aware that his\nown account of this \u201claw\u201d is quite new. Not least, this\n\u201cfact, as it were\u201d does not feature in his earlier\ntreatise, the Groundwork, and does not appear again.\n\nOne school of thought\u2014which includes many influential Kant\nscholars, and is sympathetically represented in Allison 1990 (Chs. 12\nand 13)\u2014sees a fundamental change in Kant\u2019s thought here.\nPart III of the Groundwork seems to give a\n\u201cdeduction\u201d (justification) of freedom. But in the second\nCritique Kant realizes that his own premises do not allow\nsuch an argument. So he stops argument short by appealing to a\nsupposedly indubitable fact.\n\nOther commentators emphasize the clear continuities between the two\nbooks. In particular, Kant relies on common moral consciousness in\nboth. \u0141uk\u00f3w 1993 emphasizes the parallel between\nAchtung (\u201crespect\u201d or \u201creverence\u201d for\nmorality) and the fact of reason. Kant refers to respect in all his\nethical writings: it is the only feeling \u201cself-wrought\nby a rational concept [= the moral law]\u201d (4:401n). As such, it\nclearly resembles what he now calls \u201cthe sole fact of pure\nreason\u201d (5:31). (See also O\u2019Neill 2002 and Timmermann\n2010.) Moreover, Kant uses the Latin word factum. Arguably,\nthis is better translated as deed rather than fact. In other\nwords, Kant points to an act of reason as well as the\nfact that it creates (Kleingeld 2010).\n\nIn any case, Kant\u2019s line of thought in the long passage quoted\nabove is fairly clear: We all (most of us) recognize that there are\nsituations where we ought to do something, even though it will cost us\ndearly. In other words, we feel that we are subject to an\nunconditional moral imperative. When we acknowledge this\n\u201cought,\u201d we show our belief in the possibility of acting\non it. This shows us to be free\u2014not merely in the negative sense\nthat we could go against our inclinations, but also in the positive\nsense that we can do our duty (4:446). Only our moral awareness\nreveals this freedom.\n\nClearly, this line of thought is not immune to criticism. For example,\nour feeling of moral constraint might be explained in terms of a\nFreudian super-ego. But it shows why Kant thought that moral\nawareness\u2014unlike any other sort of experience\u2014gives us a\npractical certainty of our freedom. While this is not knowledge in the\nempirical or scientific sense, it provides a basis for practical\nreasoning: \u201ca fact [Faktum] in which pure reason in us\nproves itself actually practical\u201d (5:42). And if Kant is right\nthat only the Categorical Imperative reveals our capacity to act in\nways that we can justify to others, then we can see why he claims,\n\u201cfreedom and unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each\nother\u201d (5:29f).\n",
