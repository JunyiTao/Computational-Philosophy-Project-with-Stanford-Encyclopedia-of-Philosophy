    "main_text": "Categories of Rights\n3. Categories of Rights\n\nCivil rights have often been understood by way of contrast with claims\nsaid to belong to different categories of rights: political, social,\nwelfare and cultural, among others. Competing conceptions of civil\nrights have drawn the contrasts in different ways and for different\npurposes. To the extent that a particular contrast is used to express\na view that unduly limits the scope of claims belonging to free and\nequal citizenship, the contrast is subject to critique and revision on\nthe basis of a suitably capacious idea of civil rights. Such critique\nand revision were what led to the abandonment of the once widespread\nview that political rights are not civil rights. And, in the judgment\nof many, though not all, contemporary thinkers, welfare and cultural\nrights, like political rights, are essential to the freedom and\nequality of citizens and so ought to be counted as types of civil\nrights rather than as rights of an altogether different kind.\n",
