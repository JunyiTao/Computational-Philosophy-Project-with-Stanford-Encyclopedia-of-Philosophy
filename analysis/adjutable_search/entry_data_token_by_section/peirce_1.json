Difficulty of Access to Peirce\u2019s Writings\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s extensive publications are scattered among various\npublication media, and have been difficult to collect. Shortly after\nhis death in 1914, his widow Juliette sold his unpublished manuscripts\nto the Department of Philosophy at Harvard University. Initially they\nwere under the care of Josiah Royce, but after Royce\u2019s death in 1916,\nand especially after the end of the First World War, the papers were\npoorly cared for. Many of them were misplaced, lost, given away,\nscrambled, and the like. Carolyn Eisele, one of several genuine heroes\nin the great effort to locate and assemble Peirce\u2019s writings,\ndiscovered a lost trunk full of Peirce\u2019s papers and manuscripts only\nin the mid-1950s; the trunk had been secreted, apparently for decades,\nin an unlit, obscure part of the basement in Harvard\u2019s Widener\nLibrary.\n\n\nIn the 1930s volumes of The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders\nPeirce began to appear, with Charles Hartshorne, Paul Weiss, and\nArthur Burks as their editors. For almost three decades these volumes,\nand various collections of entries culled from them were the only\ngenerally available source for Peirce\u2019s thoughts. Unfortunately, many\nof the entries in the Collected Papers are not integral\npieces of Peirce\u2019s own design, but rather stretches of writing that\nwere cobbled together by the editors at their own discretion\n(sometimes one might almost say \u201cwhim\u201d) from different Peircean\nsources. Often a single entry will consist of patches of writing from\nvery different periods of Peirce\u2019s intellectual life, and these\npatches might even be in tension or outright contradiction with each\nother. Such entries in the Collected Papers make very\ndifficult reading if one tries to regard them as consistent, sustained\npassages of argument. They also tend to give the reader a false\npicture of Peirce as unsystematic, desultory, and unable to complete a\ntrain of thought. In general, even though Peirce is often obscure and \neven at his best is seldom\neasy to read, the Collected Papers make Peirce\u2019s thinking look \nmuch more obscure than it really is.\n\n\nThe only sensible and intelligent way to publish the works of someone\nlike Peirce, who wrote voluminously and over such a long period of\ntime (57 years), is to arrange the publication chronologically and to\nemploy extremely careful editing. In such a fashion, the entire set of\nPeircean works can be presented, as Peirce conceived them and in their\nnatural temporal setting and order. Finally, beginning in 1976 with\nthe organizational conception of Max H. Fisch and the help of Edward\nMoore, the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) was created at Indiana\nUniversity-Purdue University at Indianapolis (UIPUI). Then, under the\nPEP, in the 1980s, there began to appear a meticulously edited\nchronological edition of carefully selected works of Peirce: this is\nthe Writings of Charles S. Peirce: a Chronological Edition,\nedited by The Peirce Edition Project of the Indiana University-Purdue\nUniversity at Indianapolis. Although the Chronological\nEdition has been fettered from time to time by lack of proper\nfunding, the Chronological Edition has succeeded in covering\nextremely well in its first seven published volumes the major writings\nfrom 1857 to 1892. (At the present time, October 2014, Volume 7 is\nstill awaiting publication, even though Volume 8, covering writings\nfrom 1890 to 1892 already has been published. Volume 7 is to be an\nedition of Peirce\u2019s definitions for the Century\nDictionary. It is to be edited by the Peirce Edition Project in\nconjunction with the University of Quebec at Montreal (UQAM)), under\nthe supervision of Professor Francois Latraverse.) The impressive\nachievement of the PEP is finally making it possible to assess the\nreal Peirce, instead of the chopped-up and then re-pasted-together\npicture of Peirce previously available. In particular the\nChronological Edition has made it possible to see the\ndevelopment of Peirce\u2019s thinking from its earliest stages to its later\ndevelopments. Questions long vexed in Peirce scholarship are finally\nbeginning to be debated usefully by Peirce scholars: whether there is\ngenuine systematic unity in Peirce\u2019s thought, whether his ideas\nchanged or remained the same over time, in what particulars his\nthought did change and why, when exactly certain notions were first\nconceived by Peirce, whether there were definite \u201cperiods\u201d\nin Peirce\u2019s intellectual development, and what exactly Peirce meant by\nsome of his more obscure notions such as his universal categories (on\nwhich see below).  Continued funding for the Peirce Edition Project is\nobviously a crucial priority in the ongoing effort to bring to public\nlight the thoughts of this extremely important American\nphilosopher.\n\n\nIn addition to the Chronological Edition of the Peirce\nEdition Project, other venues for editing and publishing Peirce\u2019s work\nare regularly found, and there are several excellent editions of\nparticular lectures, lecture-series, chains of correspondence, and the\nlike. Just four such editions will be mentioned here. First, there is\nthe edition of Peirce\u2019s Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, edited\nby Kenneth Laine Ketner and with an introduction on the consequences\nof mathematics by Kenneth Laine Ketner and Hilary Putnam and comments\non the lectures by Hilary Putnam, entitled Reasoning and the Logic\nof Things. Second, there is the edition of Peirce\u2019s Harvard\nLectures on Pragmatism of 1903, edited by Patricia Ann Turrisi,\nentitled Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right\nThinking. Third, there is the four-volume edition of Peirce\u2019s\nmathematical writings edited by Carolyn Eisele, entitled The New\nElements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce. Fourth, there is\nthe two-part edition of Peirce\u2019s writings on the history and logic of\nscience edited by Carolyn Eisele, entitled Historical Perspectives\non Peirce\u2019s Logic of Science: A History of Science.\n",
