    "main_text": "Deservers, Desert, and Desert Bases\n2. Deservers, Desert, and Desert Bases\n\nIn his seminal work on desert and justice (Feinberg 1970) Joel\nFeinberg presented a catalog of types of seemingly uncontroversial\ndesert claims: a student might deserve a high grade in virtue of\nhaving written a good paper; an athlete might deserve a prize in\nvirtue of having excelled in a competition; a successful researcher\nmight deserve an expression of gratitude in virtue of having perfected\na disease-preventing serum; a criminal might deserve the contempt of\nhis community in virtue of having committed crimes; the victim of an\nindustrial accident may deserve compensation from his negligent\nemployer; a hard-working public official may deserve to be promoted to\na higher office in virtue of her diligence. Leibniz, Kant, and others\nfocused on examples in which a person is said to deserve happiness in\nvirtue of having been morally excellent. \n\nIn all these familiar cases, the deserver is a person. But as Feinberg\nhimself mentioned, there does not seem to be any conceptual barrier to\nsaying that non-persons may also be deservers. Thus, for example, it\nseems acceptable to say that a beautiful ancient city deserves to be\npreserved; that a unique and formerly vibrant ecosystem deserves to be\nrestored; that the scene of a horrible massacre deserves to be torn\ndown. In moral and political discussions, cases under scrutiny tend to\nbe ones in which deservers are either individual people or groups of\npeople. This should not blind us to the fact that non-persons can also\nbe deservers. \n\nDesert claims also typically involve a desert. This is the\nthing that the deserver is said to deserve. As Feinberg indicated,\nfamiliar deserts include such things as grades, wages, prizes,\nrespect, honors and awards, rights, love, benefits and other such\nthings. Leibniz and Kant would surely insist that we include happiness\namong the possible deserts; and others would insist that we should\nmention welfare. \n\nThose deserts may seem at first to be \u201cpositive.\u201d However,\nthere are \u201cnegative\u201d counterparts. Indeed, some of the\nitems on that list are already negative. Thus, some grades are bad\ngrades, as for example, the F a student might deserve for a very weak\npaper. Other deserts are uniformly negative: burdens, fines, booby\nprizes, contempt, dishonors, onerous obligations, penalties,\ncondemnation, hate, etc. \n\nSome contributors to the literature on desert suggest that every\ndesert is either a plus or a minus. Some speak, in this context of\n\u201cbenefits and burdens,\u201d or advantages and disadvantages.\nHowever, there are cases in which someone deserves something that is\nneither good nor bad, neither a benefit nor a burden. Suppose someone\nwho has done outstanding academic work deserves to get an A, while\nsomeone who has done completely unsatisfactory work deserves to get an\nF. It is reasonable to suppose that the A is a good grade \u2013\nsomething the recipient will be pleased to get \u2013 and the F is a\nbad grade \u2013 something that the recipient will be disappointed to\nget. But suppose a student did mediocre work and deserves a mediocre\ngrade \u2013 a C. This is neither good nor bad, neither a benefit nor\na burden. Nevertheless, someone might deserve it. This would be a case\nin which someone deserves something that is neither\n\u201cpositive\u201d nor \u201cnegative.\u201d \n\nThe same could be true of welfare. Someone might deserve happiness and\n(we may assume) that would be a good thing to get; someone else might\ndeserve unhappiness and (we may assume) that would be a bad thing to\nget. But another person might deserve to be at an intermediate welfare\nlevel, neither happy nor unhappy. While it might be good in some way\nfor the person to be at that neutral welfare level, the thing he\ndeserves would be neither good nor bad. So while it is convenient to\nsay that deserts are benefits or burdens \u2013 things that will be\ngood or bad for the deserver to receive \u2013 in fact some deserts\nare neither benefits nor burdens. \n\nFeinberg suggested that we can distinguish between \u201cbasic\u201d\nand \u201cderived\u201d deserts. He went on to say that basic\ndeserts are always responsive attitudes such as approval and\ndisapproval. On this view, derived deserts are forms of treatment that\nwould be fitting expressions of the more fundamental basic deserts.\nThus, giving a student an A might be the fitting expression for\napproval of her work; giving a student an F might be the most fitting\nexpression of serious disapproval of her work. Some recent\ncontributors to the literature on desert seem to ignore this\ndistinction between basic and derived desert, but others continue to\nemploy the distinction and to treat it as important. Scanlon, for\nexample, makes it a central feature of his conception of desert (see\nScanlon 2013, 2018). \n\nPerhaps the most important and controversial bit of information we\ntypically seek in connection with a claim about desert concerns the\ndesert base. This is generally taken to be the feature in\nvirtue of which the deserver deserves the desert. On this view, a\ndesert base is always a property. If we adopt this view, we will say\n(for example) that the student deserves a high grade in virtue of her\npossession of the property of having produced course work of high\nquality. On another view, a desert base is always a fact. If we\nadopt this view we will prefer to say that the student deserves her\nhigh grade in virtue of the fact that her work was of such high\nquality. \n\nWe are inclined to think that it makes no difference whether we take\ndesert bases to be properties or to be facts. The views seem to be\nintertranslatable. In this article, simply as a matter of convenience,\nwe generally speak of desert bases as properties. \n\nIn some cases there is little debate about whether a certain property\nserves as a desert base for a certain sort of treatment. This may be\nillustrated by the example of the student who produced outstanding\nwork in a course and deserves a high grade. Few would debate the claim\nthat the student deserves the grade in virtue of the high quality of\nher work. The desert base in that case would be having produced\nacademic work of high quality. Similarly consider the case of the\ncold-blooded criminal who has inflicted great harm on many innocent\nvictims. It is reasonable to suppose that he deserves a harsh penalty\nin virtue of his evil behavior. In this case, the desert base is\nsomething like having inflicted great harm on many innocent\nvictims. \n\nIn other cases, however, there would be more controversy about desert\nbases. A good example involves the desert of wages. Suppose an\nemployee works hard, is productive, is loyal to his employer, and in\nvirtue of some health problems in his family, needs more money. We may\nagree in such a case that the employee deserves a raise \u2013 but we\nmay disagree about the basis on which he deserves that raise. \n\nThere is general agreement that properties of certain types cannot\nserve as desert bases. Consider a case in which punishing an innocent\nperson would have good consequences. The person has this property:\nbeing such that punishing him would have good consequences.\nBut it would be seriously counterintuitive to say that the person\ndeserves punishment in virtue of his possession of this property. \n\nCertain general principles about desert bases have been introduced in\nan effort to explain why certain properties seem ineligible to serve\nas desert bases. Perhaps the least controversial principle is the\nso-called \u201cAboutness Principle,\u201d mentioned by Feinberg. In\nits propositional form, this principle says that a person can deserve\nsomething in virtue of a certain fact only if that fact is a fact\n\u201cabout the person.\u201d In its property form, the principle\nwould say that a person can deserve something in virtue of a certain\nproperty only if the person actually has the property. The Aboutness\nPrinciple does not offer any assistance with respect to the punishment\ncase just mentioned. After all, the innocent person in that example\nactually does have the property of being such that punishing him\nwould have good consequences. The fact that punishing him would\nhave good consequences is a fact about him. \n\nSome have said that if someone deserves something, D, in virtue of\nhaving some desert base, DB, then the deserving one must be\nresponsible for having DB (see, for example, Rawls 1971; Rachels 1978;\nSadurski 1985). This \u201cResponsibility Principle\u201d seems to\nbe satisfied by many of the examples already discussed. The good\nstudent, we may suppose, is responsible for having produced good\nacademic work. The cold-blooded criminal, similarly, may seem\nresponsible for his vicious behavior. The hard working employee bears\nsome responsibility for having worked so hard. We may generalize from\nthese cases and conclude that all cases of desert are like this: if\nsomeone deserves something, D, on some basis, DB, then he or she is\nresponsible for having DB. Appeal to the Responsibility Principle\nwould explain why the innocent person does not deserve punishment. He\nis not responsible for having the property of being such that\npunishing him would have good consequences. \n\nA variety of cases have been offered as counterexamples to the\nResponsibility Principle. Feldman (1995a) described a case in which\npatrons at a restaurant became ill as a result of having been served\nspoiled food. He claimed that the patrons in such a case would deserve\ncompensation. The desert base here seems to be having been harmed\nby the negligent food preparation by the restaurant \u2013 yet\nthe patrons were not responsible for having that desert base. They\nwere innocent victims. A similar thing happens in the case of someone\nwho has been egregiously insulted. She may deserve an apology in\nvirtue of having been insulted, but she is not responsible for the\ninsult. Another case mentioned by McLeod involves a child who, through\nno fault of his own, comes down with a painful illness. He deserves\nthe care and sympathy of his parents, yet he is not responsible for\nhaving become ill. \n\nOthers have suggested what may be called \u201cthe Temporality\nPrinciple\u201d: the idea here is roughly this: if someone deserves\nsomething, D, in virtue of having a certain desert base, DB, then he\nor she must already have DB at the time he or she begins to deserve D\n(see, for example, Rachels 1978; Kleinig 1971; Sadurski 1985). You\ncannot deserve something on the basis of a property you will begin to\nhave only later. The Temporality Principle has been invoked in an\neffort to explain why it is wrong to engage in\n\u201cpre-punishment.\u201d It is said that even if a certain person\nis going to commit a crime, he does not begin to deserve punishment\nfor that crime until he actually commits it. This line of thought has\nbeen debated. One problem is that even before he commits the crime,\nthe future criminal already has this property: being such that he\nwill later commit a crime. It might be said that he deserves\npunishment in virtue of already having this property even before he\ncommits the crime. While the Temporality Principle is widely endorsed,\ncounterexamples have been presented (see, for example, Feldman 1995b).\nThose counterexamples have not been universally accepted (see, for\nexample, Smilansky 1996a, 1996b).\n\nIn many cases, when we make a desert claim we mention a\ndistributor. This is the person or institution from whom the\ndeserver deserves to receive the desert. In some cases, the identity\nof the distributor will be clear. In other cases, it is not so clear.\nConsider, for example, the motto that the McDonald\u2019s restaurants\nformerly used: \u2018You deserve a break today.\u2019 No distributor\nis explicitly mentioned in the motto. It just says that you deserve a\nbreak. Perhaps when McDonald\u2019s made this statement, they did not\nhave any particular distributor in mind. Maybe they just thought that\nyou deserve it from someone. The same would be true of the\nGates Foundation\u2019s former motto according to which \u2018Every\nperson deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive\nlife.\u2019 The motto does not mention anyone who has the job of\nensuring that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive\nlife. Given that no one has the capacity to ensure that everyone lives\na healthy and productive life, we may conclude that in this case no\ndistributor is mentioned precisely because no one is qualified to be a\ndistributor. \n\nIn other cases, there is a distributor and its identity is clear.\nConsider, for example, the claim that a certain elderly professor\ndeserves some respect from his unruly students. Here the distributor\nis explicitly mentioned: it is the unruly students. Those who endorse\nthe notion that virtuous people deserve happiness in heaven will\npresumably say that the distributor in that case is God. In social and\npolitical contexts we often find philosophers assuming that citizens\ndeserve certain rights from the government of their country. \n\nIt may seem that we could relocate this reference to the distributor.\nWe could build reference to the distributor into the description of\nthe desert. Thus, instead of saying that the desert in the example\ninvolving the elderly professor is respect, we could say that\nthe desert is respect from his students. \n\nIn some cases a desert statement may also indicate something about the\nstrength of the deserver\u2019s desert of the thing deserved. The\nstrength of someone\u2019s desert of something might be indicated\nloosely, as when we say that someone\u2019s desert of something is\n\u201cvery strong,\u201d or \u201conly slight.\u201d In some cases\nwe can use some numbers to represent strengths of desert, though the\nchoice of a numbering system will be to some extent arbitrary. But\nthere are some important facts here: sometimes you deserve both A and\nB, but you deserve A more than you deserve B; sometimes two different\ndeservers deserve the same thing and it is not possible for both of\nthem to get it; maybe one of them deserves it more than the other.\nSometimes you deserve something, but only to a very slight degree and\nthis desert could easily be overridden by some other consideration.\n\n\nIn many cases a desert statement (if fully spelled out) would also\nindicate some times. One of these is the time of the\ndeserving; the other is the time when the receipt of the desert is\nsupposed to take place. Thus, for example, suppose a lot of money has\nbeen withheld from a certain person\u2019s paycheck each week for a\nwhole year. Suppose in fact the government has withheld more than the\nperson owes in taxes. Then he deserves a refund. Suppose refunds are\nall given out on April 1. We might want to say this: at every moment\nin March, the taxpayer deserves to get a refund on April 1. In this\nexample, the time of the deserving is every moment in March.\nThe time at which the deserver deserves to receive the desert is April\n1. \n",
