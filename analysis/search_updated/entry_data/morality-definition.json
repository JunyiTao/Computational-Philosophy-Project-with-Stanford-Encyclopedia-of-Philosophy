    "preamble": "\n\nThe topic of this entry is not\u2014at least directly\u2014moral\ntheory; rather, it is the definition of morality. Moral\ntheories are large and complex things; definitions are not. The\nquestion of the definition of morality is the question of identifying\nthe target of moral theorizing. Identifying this target\nenables us to see different moral theories as attempting to capture\nthe very same thing. And it enables psychologists, anthropologists,\nevolutionary biologists, and other more empirically-oriented theorists\nto design their experiments or formulate their hypotheses without\nprejudicing matters too much in terms of the specific content a code,\njudgment, or norm must have in order to count as distinctively\nmoral.\n\nThere does not seem to be much reason to think that a single\ndefinition of morality will be applicable to all moral discussions.\nOne reason for this is that \u201cmorality\u201d seems to be used in\ntwo distinct broad senses: a descriptive sense and a normative sense.\nMore particularly, the term \u201cmorality\u201d can be used\neither\n\ndescriptively to refer to certain codes of conduct put forward by\na society or a group (such as a religion), or accepted by an\nindividual for her own behavior, or\nnormatively to refer to a code of conduct that, given specified\nconditions, would be put forward by all rational people.\n\n\nWhich of these two senses of \u201cmorality\u201d a moral\nphilosopher is using plays a crucial, although sometimes\nunacknowledged, role in the development of an ethical theory. If one\nuses \u201cmorality\u201d in its descriptive sense, and therefore\nuses it to refer to codes of conduct actually put forward by distinct\ngroups or societies, one will almost certainly deny that there is a\nuniversal morality that applies to all human beings. The descriptive\nuse of \u201cmorality\u201d is the one used by anthropologists when\nthey report on the morality of the societies that they study.\nRecently, some comparative and evolutionary psychologists (Haidt 2006;\nHauser 2006; De Waal 1996) have taken morality, or a close\nanticipation of it, to be present among groups of non-human animals:\nprimarily, but not exclusively, other primates.\n\nAccepting that there are two uses or senses of\n\u201cmorality\u201d\u2014a descriptive sense and a normative\nsense\u2014does not commit one to holding that the \u201cdistinction\nbetween descriptions and norms\u2014between what is and what ought to\nbe\u2014is obvious and unbridgeable\u201d, as some have held that it\ndoes (Churchland 2011: 185). To see this, note that it is obvious that\nthere is a descriptive sense of morality. That is, it is obvious that\none can sensibly describe the moralities of various groups without\nmaking any normative claims. And it should be equally obvious that\nthat one might hold that a certain code of conduct would be put\nforward by all rational people under certain conditions without having\nany particular views about the nature of the is/ought gap or the\npossibility of crossing it.\n\nAny definition of \u201cmorality\u201d in the descriptive sense will\nneed to specify which of the codes put forward by a society\nor group count as moral. Even in small homogeneous societies that have\nno written language, distinctions are sometimes made between morality,\netiquette, law, and religion. And in larger and more complex societies\nthese distinctions are often sharply marked. So \u201cmorality\u201d\ncannot be taken to refer to every code of conduct put forward by a\nsociety.\n\nIn the normative sense, \u201cmorality\u201d refers to a code of\nconduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets certain\nintellectual and volitional conditions, almost always including the\ncondition of being rational. That a person meets these conditions is\ntypically expressed by saying that the person counts as a moral\nagent. However, merely showing that a certain code would be\naccepted by any moral agent is not enough to show that the code is the\nmoral code. It might well be that all moral agents would also accept a\ncode of prudence or rationality, but this would not by itself show\nthat prudence was part of morality. So something else must be added;\nfor example, that the code can be understood to involve a certain kind\nof impartiality, or that it can be understood as having the function\nof making it possible for people to live together in groups.\n\nAs we\u2019ve just seen, not all codes that are put forward by\nsocieties or groups are moral codes in the descriptive sense of\nmorality, and not all codes that would be accepted by all moral\nagents are moral codes in the normative sense of morality. So any\ndefinition of morality\u2014in either sense\u2014will require\nfurther criteria. Still, each of these two very brief descriptions of\ncodes might be regarded as offering some features of morality that\nwould be included in any adequate definition. In that way they might\nbe taken to be offering some definitional features of\nmorality, in each of its two senses. When one has specified enough\ndefinitional features to allow one to classify all the relevant moral\ntheories as theories of a common subject, one might then be taken to\nhave given a definition of morality. This is the sense of\n\u201cdefinition\u201d at work in this entry.\n\nExplicit attempts, by philosophers, to define morality are hard to\nfind, at least since the beginning of the twentieth century. One\npossible explanation for this is the combined effect of early\npositivistic worries about the metaphysical status of normative\nproperties, followed (or augmented) by Wittgensteinian worries about\ndefinitions of any significant terms whatsoever. Whatever the\nexplanation, when definitions have been offered, they have tended to\nbe directed at the notion of moral judgment (Hare 1952, 1981) rather\nthan at morality itself. However, to the degree that these definitions\nof moral judgment are adequate, they might, without much effort, be\nconverted into definitions of morality in the descriptive sense. For\nexample, a particular person\u2019s morality might be regarded as the\ncontent of the basic moral judgments that person is prepared to\naccept.\n\nOne might use a detailed definition of moral judgment to define\nmorality in a descriptive sense in another way\u2014other than simply\nas the content of a person\u2019s moral judgments, or the content of\nthe moral judgments that prevail in a certain society or group. In\nparticular, the very features of a judgment that make it qualify as a\nmoral judgment might be transposed from a psychological key to\nsomething more abstract. Here is one simplified example. Suppose that\na negative judgment of an action only counts as a negative moral\njudgment if it involves the idea that there is a prima facie case for\npunishing that action. In that case, a definition of morality in the\ndescriptive sense will include a corresponding idea: that the\nprohibitions of morality, taken in the descriptive sense, are those\nthat are backed by the threat of punishment. Of course, if one goes\nthis route, other conditions will need to be included, to\ndifferentiate morality from criminal law.\n\nWhat counts as definitional of morality, in either sense of\n\u201cmorality\u201d, is controversial. Moreover, the line between\nwhat is part of a definition, in the sense at issue, and what is part\nof a moral theory, is not entirely sharp. For example, some might\nregard it as definitional of morality, in the normative sense, that it\ngoverns only interpersonal interactions. Others, however, might take\nthis to be a substantive theoretical claim. Some might take it as\ndefinitional of \u201cmorality\u201d in its descriptive sense that\nit be a code of conduct that a person or group takes to be most\nimportant. But others might say that attention to religion casts doubt\non this idea.\n\n\u201cMorality\u201d, when used in a descriptive sense, has an\nimportant feature that \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense\ndoes not have: a feature that stems from its relational nature. This\nfeature is the following: that if one is not a member of the relevant\nsociety or group, or is not the relevant individual, then accepting a\ncertain account of the content of a morality, in the descriptive\nsense, has no implications for how one thinks one should behave. On\nthe other hand, if one accepts a moral theory\u2019s account of moral\nagents, and of the conditions under which all moral agents would\nendorse a code of conduct as a moral code, then one accepts that moral\ntheory\u2019s normative definition of \u201cmorality\u201d.\nAccepting an account of \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense\ncommits one to regarding some behavior as immoral, perhaps even\nbehavior that one is tempted to perform. Because accepting an account\nof \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense involves this\ncommitment, it is not surprising that philosophers seriously disagree\nabout which account to accept.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Is Morality Unified Enough to Define?\n\nAn assumption suggested by the very existence of this encyclopedia\nentry is that there is some unifying set of features in virtue of\nwhich all moral systems count as moral systems. But Sinnott-Armstrong\n(2016) directly argues against an analogous hypothesis in connection\nwith moral judgments, and also seems to take this view to suggest that\nmorality itself is not a unified domain. He points out that moral\njudgments cannot be unified by any appeal to the notion of harm to\nothers, since there are such things as moral ideals, and there are\nharmless behaviors that a significant number of people regard as\nmorally wrong: Sinnott-Armstrong gives example such as cannibalism and\nflag-burning. Whether people who condemn such behaviors morally are\ncorrect in those judgments is largely irrelevant to the question of\nwhether they count as moral in the first place.\n\nSinnott-Armstrong seems right in holding that moral judgments cannot\nbe delimited from other judgments simply by appeal to their content.\nIt seems quite possible for someone to have been raised in such a way\nas to hold that it is morally wrong for adult men to wear shorts. And\nit also seems plausible that, as he also argues, moral judgments\ncannot be identified by reference to any sort of neurological feature\ncommon and peculiar to them and them alone. A third strategy might be\nto claim that moral judgments are those one makes as a result of\nhaving been inducted into a social practice that has a certain\nfunction. However, this function cannot simply be to help facilitate\nthe sorts of social interactions that enable societies to flourish and\npersist, since too many obviously non-moral judgments do this.\n\nBeyond the problem just described, attempts to pick out moral codes in\nthe descriptive sense by appeal to their function often seem to be\nspecifying the function that the theorist thinks morality, in the\nnormative sense, would serve, rather than the function that actual\nmoralities do serve. For example, Greene claims that \n\n\nmorality is a set of psychological adaptations that allow otherwise\nselfish individuals to reap the benefits of cooperation, (2013: 23)\n\n\n\nand Haidt claims that \n\n\nmoral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms,\npractices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved\npsychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate\nself-interest and make cooperative societies possible. (2011: 270)\n\n\n\nBut these claims need to deal with the existence of dysfunctional\nmoralities that do not in fact serve these functions. Perhaps this\nproblem could be alleviated by pointing out that many instances of a\nkind that have a function\u2014for example, an actual human\nheart\u2014fail to fulfill that function.\n\nEven if Sinnott-Armstrong\u2019s position is correct with regard to\nmorality in the descriptive sense, there might nevertheless be a code\nof conduct that, given certain specified conditions, would be put\nforward by all rational agents. That is, even if the descriptive sense\nof morality is a family-resemblance notion, vaguely bordered and\nopen-textured, or even if it is significantly disjunctive and\ndisunified, the normative sense might not be. By way of comparison, we\nmight think of the notion of food in two ways: as what people regard\nas food, and as what they would regard as food if they were rational and\nfully informed. Certainly there is not much that unifies the first\ncategory: not even being digestible or nutritious, since people regard\nvarious indigestible and non-nutritious substances as food, and forego\nmuch that is digestible and nutritious. But that does not mean that we\ncannot theorize about what it would be rational to regard as food.\n2. Descriptive Definitions of \u201cMorality\u201d\n\nAn initial na\u00efve attempt at a descriptive definition of\n\u201cmorality\u201d might take it to refer to the most important\ncode of conduct put forward by a society and accepted by the members\nof that society. But the existence of large and heterogeneous\nsocieties raises conceptual problems for such a descriptive\ndefinition, since there may not be any such society-wide code that is\nregarded as most important. As a result, a definition might be offered\nin which \u201cmorality\u201d refers to the most important code of\nconduct put forward and accepted by any group, or even by an\nindividual. Apart from containing some prohibitions on harming\n(certain) others, different moralities\u2014when\n\u201cmorality\u201d is understood in this way\u2014can vary in\ncontent quite substantially.\n\nEtiquette is sometimes included as a part of morality, applying to\nnorms that are considered less serious than the kinds of norms for\nbehavior that are more central to morality. Hobbes expresses this sort\nof view when he uses the term \u201csmall morals\u201d to describe\n\u201cdecency of behavior, as how one man should salute another, or\nhow a man should wash his mouth or pick his teeth before\ncompany\u201d, and distinguishes these from \u201cthose qualities of\nmankind that concern their living together in peace and unity\u201d\n(1660 [1994]: Chapter XI, paragraph 1). When etiquette is included as\npart of morality, morality is almost always being understood in the\ndescriptive sense. One reason for this is that it is clear that the\nrules of etiquette are relative to a society or group. Moreover, there\nare no plausible conditions under which we could pick out the\n\u201ccorrect\u201d rules of etiquette as those that would be\naccepted by all rational beings.\n\nLaw is distinguished from morality by having explicit written rules,\npenalties, and officials who interpret the laws and apply the\npenalties. Although there is often considerable overlap in the conduct\ngoverned by morality and that governed by law, laws are often\nevaluated\u2014and changed\u2014on moral grounds. Some theorists,\nincluding Ronald Dworkin (1986), have even maintained that the\ninterpretation of law must make use of morality.\n\nAlthough the morality of a group or society may derive from its\nreligion, morality and religion are not the same thing, even in that\ncase. Morality is only a guide to conduct, whereas religion is always\nmore than this. For example, religion includes stories about events in\nthe past, usually about supernatural beings, that are used to explain\nor justify the behavior that it prohibits or requires. Although there\nis often a considerable overlap in the conduct prohibited or required\nby religion and that prohibited or required by morality, religions may\nprohibit or require more than is prohibited or required by guides to\nbehavior that are explicitly labeled as moral guides, and may\nrecommend some behavior that is prohibited by morality. Even when\nmorality is not regarded as the code of conduct that is put forward by\na formal religion, it is often thought to require some religious\nexplanation and justification. However, just as with law, some\nreligious practices and precepts are criticized on moral grounds,\ne.g., that the practice or precept involves discrimination on the\nbasis of race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nWhen \u201cmorality\u201d is used simply to refer to a code of\nconduct put forward by an actual group, including a society, even if\nit is distinguished from etiquette, law, and religion, it is being\nused in a descriptive sense. It is also being used in the descriptive\nsense when it refers to important attitudes of individuals. Just as\none can refer to the morality of the Greeks, so one can refer to the\nmorality of a particular person. This descriptive use of\n\u201cmorality\u201d is now becoming more prominent because of the\nwork of psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt (2006), who have been\ninfluenced by the views of David Hume (1751), including his attempt to\npresent a naturalistic account of moral judgments.\n\nGuides to behavior that are regarded as moralities normally involve\navoiding and preventing harm to others (Frankena 1980), and perhaps\nsome norm of honesty (Strawson 1961). But all of them involve other\nmatters as well, and Hare\u2019s view of morality as that which is\nmost important allows that these other matters may be more important\nthan avoiding and preventing harm to others (Hare 1952, 1963, 1981).\nThis view of morality as concerning that which is most important to a\nperson or group allows matters related to religious practices and\nprecepts, or matters related to customs and traditions, e.g., purity\nand sanctity, to be more important than avoiding and preventing\nharm.\n\nWhen \u201cmorality\u201d is used in a descriptive sense, moralities\ncan differ from each other quite extensively in their content and in\nthe foundation that members of the society claim their morality to\nhave. Some societies may claim that their morality, which is more\nconcerned with purity and sanctity, is based on the commands of God.\nThe descriptive sense of \u201cmorality\u201d, which allows for the\nview that morality is based on religion in this way, picks out codes\nof conduct that are often in significant conflict with all normative\naccounts of morality.\n\nA society might have a morality that takes accepting its traditions\nand customs, including accepting the authority of certain people and\nemphasizing loyalty to the group, as more important than avoiding and\npreventing harm. Such a morality might not count as immoral any\nbehavior that shows loyalty to the preferred group, even if that\nbehavior causes significant harm to innocent people who are not in\nthat group. The familiarity of this kind of morality, which makes\nin-group loyalty almost equivalent to morality, seems to allow some\ncomparative and evolutionary psychologists, including Frans De Waal\n(1996), to regard non-human animals to be acting in ways very similar\nto those that are regarded as moral.\n\nAlthough all societies include more than just a concern for minimizing\nharm to (some) human beings in their moralities, this feature of\nmorality, unlike purity and sanctity, or accepting authority and\nemphasizing loyalty, is included in everything that is regarded as a\nmorality by any society. Because minimizing harm can conflict with\naccepting authority and emphasizing loyalty, there can be fundamental\ndisagreements within a society about the morally right way to behave\nin particular kinds of situations. Philosophers such as Bentham (1789)\nand Mill (1861), who accept a normative account of morality that takes\nthe avoiding and preventing harm element of morality to be most\nimportant, criticize all actual moralities (referred to by\n\u201cmorality\u201d in the descriptive sense) that give precedence\nto purity and loyalty when they are in conflict with avoiding and\npreventing harm.\n\nSome psychologists, such as Haidt, take morality to include concern\nwith, at least, all three of the triad of (1) harm, (2) purity, and\n(3) loyalty, and hold that different members of a society can and do\ntake different features of morality to be most important. But beyond a\nconcern with avoiding and preventing such harms to members of certain\ngroups, there may be no common content shared by all moralities in the\ndescriptive sense. Nor may there be any common justification that\nthose who accept morality claim for it; some may appeal to religion,\nothers to tradition, and others to rational human nature. Beyond the\nconcern with harm, the only other feature that all descriptive\nmoralities have in common is that they are put forward by an\nindividual or a group, usually a society, in which case they provide a\nguide for the behavior of the people in that group or society. In the\ndescriptive sense of \u201cmorality\u201d, morality may not even\nincorporate impartiality with regard to all moral agents, and it may\nnot be universalizable in any significant way (compare MacIntyre\n1957).\n\nAlthough most philosophers do not use \u201cmorality\u201d in any of\nthe above descriptive senses, some philosophers do. Ethical\nrelativists such as Harman (1975), Westermarck (1960), and Prinz\n(2007), deny that there is any universal normative morality and claim\nthat the actual moralities of societies or individuals are the only\nmoralities there are. These relativists hold that only when the term\n\u201cmorality\u201d is used in this descriptive sense is there\nsomething that \u201cmorality\u201d actually refers to. They claim\nthat it is a mistake to take \u201cmorality\u201d to refer to a\nuniversal code of conduct that, under certain conditions, would be\nendorsed by all rational persons. Although ethical relativists admit\nthat many speakers of English use \u201cmorality\u201d to refer to\nsuch a universal code of conduct, they claim such persons are mistaken\nin thinking that there is anything that is the referent of the word\n\u201cmorality\u201d taken in that sense.\n\nWong (1984, 2006, 2014) claims to be an ethical relativist because he\ndenies that there is any universal moral code that would be endorsed\nby all rational people. But what seems to stand behind this claim is\nthe idea that there are cultural variations in the relative weights\ngiven to, for example, considerations of justice and considerations of\ninterpersonal responsibility. And he assumes that those who believe in\na universal morality are committed to the idea that \u201cif there is\nfundamental disagreement, someone has got it wrong\u201d (2014: 339).\nBut Gert (2005) is certainly not a relativist, and it is central to\nhis moral theory that there are fundamental disagreements in the\nrankings of various harms and benefits, and with regard to who is\nprotected by morality, and no unique right answer in such cases. Wong\nhimself is willing to say that some moralities are better than others,\nbecause he thinks that the moral domain is delimited by a functional\ncriterion: among the functions of a morality are that it promote and\nregulate social cooperation, help individuals rank their own\nmotivations, and reduce harm.\n\nWhen used with its descriptive sense, \u201cmorality\u201d can refer\nto codes of conduct with widely differing content, and still be used\nunambiguously. This parallels the way in which \u201claw\u201d is\nused unambiguously even though different societies have laws with\nwidely differing content. However, when \u201cmorality\u201d is used\nin its descriptive sense, it sometimes does not refer to the code of a\nsociety, but to the code of a group or an individual. As a result,\nwhen the guide to conduct put forward by, for example, a religious\ngroup conflicts with the guide to conduct put forward by a society, it\nis not clear whether to say that there are conflicting moralities,\nconflicting elements within morality, or that the code of the\nreligious group conflicts with morality.\n\nIn small homogeneous societies there may be a guide to behavior that\nis put forward by the society and that is accepted by (almost) all\nmembers of the society. For such societies there is (almost) no\nambiguity about which guide \u201cmorality\u201d refers to. However,\nin larger societies people often belong to groups that put forward\nguides to behavior that conflict with the guide put forward by their\nsociety, and members of the society do not always accept the guide put\nforward by their society. If they accept the conflicting guide of some\nother group to which they belong (often a religious group) rather than\nthe guide put forward by their society, in cases of conflict they will\nregard those who follow the guide put forward by their society as\nacting immorally.\n\nIn the descriptive sense of \u201cmorality\u201d, a person\u2019s\nown morality cannot be a guide to behavior that that person would\nprefer others not to follow. However, that fact that an individual\nadopts a moral code of conduct for his own use does not entail that\nthe person requires it to be adopted by anyone else. An\nindividual may adopt for himself a very demanding moral guide that he\nthinks may be too difficult for most others to follow. He may judge\npeople who do not adopt his code of conduct as not being as morally\ngood as he is, without judging them to be immoral if they do not adopt\nit. However, such cases do not undermine the restriction; a guide is\nplausibly referred to as a morality only when the individual would be\nwilling for others to follow it, at least if\n\u201cfollow\u201d is taken to mean \u201csuccessfully\nfollow\u201d. For it may be that the individual would not be willing\nfor others to try to follow that code, because of worries\nabout the bad effects of predictable failures due to partiality or\nlack of sufficient foresight or intelligence.\n3. Implicit and Explicit Definitions in Allied Fields\n\nPhilosophers, because they do not need to produce operational tests or\ncriteria in the way that psychologists, biologists, and\nanthropologists do, often simply take for granted that everyone knows\nwhat belongs, and does not belong, to the moral domain. This attitude\nfinds expression in the philosopher\u2019s common appeal to\nintuition, or to what everyone agrees about. For example, Michael\nSmith (1994) provides a very detailed analysis of normative reasons,\nbut in distinguishing specifically moral reasons from other sorts of\nreasons, he says only that they are picked out by appeal to a number\nof platitudes. And he makes no effort to provide anything like a\ncomprehensive list of such platitudes. Moreover, it is very likely\nthat there will be disagreement as to what counts as\nplatitudinous. Or, if it is definitional of \u201cplatitude\u201d\nthat it be uncontroversial, it may be that what is platitudinous about\nmorality will be so thin as to fail to separate morality from other\ndomains. Failing to specify which particular criteria one takes to\ngovern one\u2019s own theorizing, and consequently tacitly relying on\nthe idea that everyone already knows what counts as moral, can lead to\na number of problems. One, of course, is a conflation of morality with\nother things (see Machery 2012 on Churchland 2011). Another is that\none mistakes one\u2019s own cultural biases for universal truths\n(Haidt and Kesiber 2010).\n\nBecause theorists in psychology and anthropology often need to design\nquestionnaires and other sorts of probes of the attitudes of subjects,\nthey might be expected to be more sensitive to the need for a\nreasonably clear means of separating moral judgments from other sorts\nof judgments. After all, examining the specifically moral judgments of\nindividuals is one of the most direct means of determining what the\nmoral code of a person or group might be. But despite this\nexpectation, and roughly half a century ago, Abraham Edel (1962: 56)\ndecried the lack of an explicit concern to delimit the domain of\nmorality among anthropologists, writing that \u201cmorality\u2026is\ntaken for granted, in the sense that one can invoke it or refer to it\nat will; but it is not explained, depicted, or analysed\u201d. One\nexplanation for this that Edel suggested is the same as the\nexplanation for the same phenomenon in Philosophy: \u201cit is\nassumed that we all know what morality is and no explicit account need\nbe given\u201d. But the danger for those making this assumption, he\npoints out, is that of \u201cmerging the morality concept with social\ncontrol concepts\u201d. Reinforcing this tendency was the influence,\nin anthropology, of the sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim (1906\n[2009]), for whom morality was simply a matter of how a given society\nenforces whatever social rules it happens to have.\n\nThe failure to offer an operational definition of morality or moral\njudgment may help explain the widespread but dubious assumption in\ncontemporary anthropology, noted by James Laidlaw (2016: 456), that\naltruism is the essential and irreducible core of ethics. But Laidlaw\nalso notes that many of the features of what Bernard Williams (1985)\ndescribed as \u201cthe morality system\u201d\u2014features that\nWilliams himself criticized as the parochial result of a\nsecularization of Christian values\u2014are in fact widely shared\noutside of the West. This state of affairs leads Laidlaw to ask the\ncrucial question: \n\n\nWhich features, formal or substantive, are shared by the\n\u201cmorality system\u201d of the modern West and those of the\nother major agrarian civilizations and literate religions? \n\n\nThis is, to a very close approximation, a request for the definition\nof morality in the descriptive sense.\n\nKlenk (2019) notes that in recent years anthropology has taken what he\nterms an \u201cethical turn\u201d, recognizing moral systems, and\nethics more generally, as a distinct object of anthropological study.\nThis is a move away from the Durkheimian paradigm, and includes the\nstudy of self-development, virtues, habits, and the role of explicit\ndeliberation when moral breakdowns occur. However, Klenk\u2019s\nsurvey of attempts by anthropologists to study morality as an\nindependent domain lead him to conclude that, so far, their efforts do\n\n\n\nnot readily allow a distinction between moral considerations and other\nnormative considerations such as prudential, epistemic, or aesthetic\nones. (2019: 342)\n\n\nIn light of Edel\u2019s worry about a conflation of moral systems\nwith systems of social control, it is interesting to consider Curry\n(2016), who defends the hypothesis that \n\n\nmorality turns out to be a collection of biological and cultural\nsolutions to the problems of cooperation and conflict recurrent in\nhuman social life. (2016: 29) \n\n\nCurry notes that rules related to kinship, mutualism, exchange, and\nvarious forms of conflict resolution appear in virtually all\nsocieties. And he argues that many of them have precursors in animal\nbehavior, and can be explained by appeal to his central hypothesis of\nmorality as a solution to problems of cooperation and conflict\nresolution. He also notes that philosophers, from Aristotle through\nHume, Russell, and Rawls, all took cooperation and conflict resolution\nto be central ideas in understanding morality. It is unclear, however,\nwhether Curry\u2019s view can adequately distinguish morality from\nlaw and from other systems that aim to reduce conflict by providing\nsolutions to coordination problems.\n\nTurning from anthropology to psychology, one significant topic of\ninvestigation is the existence and nature of a distinction between the\nmoral and the conventional. More specifically, the distinction at\nissue is between (a) acts that are judged wrong only because of a\ncontingent convention or because they go against the dictates of some\nrelevant authority, and (b) those that are judged to be wrong quite\nindependently of these things, that have a seriousness to them, and\nthat are justified by appeal to the notions of harm, rights, or\njustice. Elliot Turiel emphasized this distinction, and drew attention\nto the danger, if one overlooks it, of lumping together moral rules\nwith non-moral \u201cconventions that further the coordination of\nsocial interactions within social systems\u201d (1983:\n109\u2013111). Those who accept this distinction are implicitly\noffering a definition of morality in the descriptive sense. Not\neveryone does accept the distinction, however. Edouard Machery and Ron\nMallon (2010) for example, are suspicious of the idea that\nauthority-independence, universality, justification by appeal to harm,\njustice, or rights, and seriousness form a cluster found together with\nsufficient regularity to be used to set moral norms apart from other\nnorms. Kelly et al. (2007) are similarly skeptical, and bring\nempirical evidence to bear on the question.\n\nThe psychologist Kurt Gray might be seen as offering an account of\nmoral judgment that would allow us to determine the morality of an\nindividual or group. He and his co-authors suggest that \n\n\nmorality is essentially represented by a cognitive template that\ncombines a perceived intentional agent with a perceived suffering\npatient. (Gray, Young, & Waytz 2012: 102) \n\n\nThis claim, while quite strong, is nevertheless not as implausibly\nstrong as it might seem, since the thesis is directly concerned with\nthe template we use when thinking about moral matters; it is\nnot directly concerned with the nature of morality itself. In the\nsense of \u201ctemplate\u201d at issue here, the template we use\nwhen thinking about dogs might include having four legs, a tail, and\nfur, among other things. But that does not mean that an animal must\nhave these features to count as a dog, or even that we believe\nthis.\n\nGiven the way that Gray et al. think of templates, even if their\nhypothesis is correct, it would not mean that our psychology requires\nus to think of the moral as always involving intentional agents and\nperceiving patients. In line with this, and despite some lapses in\nwhich they suggest that \u201cmoral acts can be defined in\nterms of intention and suffering\u201d, (2012: 109) their considered\nview seems to be only that the dyadic template fits the\nmajority of moral situations, as we conceive them. Moreover,\nthe link between immoral behavior and suffering to which they appeal\nin defending their general view is sometimes so indirect as to\nundermine its significance. For example, they fit authority violations\ninto their suffering-based template by noting that \u201cauthority\nstructures provide a way of peacefully resolving conflict\u201d and\nthat \u201cviolence results when social structures are\nthreatened\u201d. In a similar stretch, they account for judgments\nthat promiscuity is wrong by gesturing at the suffering involved in\nsexually transmitted diseases (2012: 107).\n\nAnother position in cognitive psychology that has relevance for the\ndefinition of morality in the descriptive sense takes moral judgment\nto be a natural kind: the product of an innate moral grammar (Mikhail\n2007). If moral judgment is a natural kind in this way, then a\nperson\u2019s moral code might simply consist in the moral judgments\nthat person is disposed to make. One piece of evidence that there is\nsuch a grammar is to be found in the relative universality of certain\nmoral concepts in human cultures: concepts such as obligation,\npermission, and prohibition. Another is an argument similar to\nChomsky\u2019s famous \u201cpoverty of the stimulus\u201d argument\nfor a universal human grammar (Dwyer et al. 2010; see also Roedder and\nHarman 2010).\n\nIn evolutionary biology, morality is sometimes simply equated with\nfairness (Baumard et al. 2013: 60, 77) or reciprocal altruism\n(Alexander 1987: 77). But it is also sometimes identified by reference\nto an evolved capacity to make a certain sort of judgment and perhaps\nalso to signal that one has made it (Hauser 2006). This also makes\nmorality into something very much like a natural kind, that can be\nidentified by reference to causal/historical processes. In that case,\na content-based definition of morality isn\u2019t required: certain\ncentral features are all that one needs to begin one\u2019s\ntheorizing, since they will be enough to draw attention to certain\npsychologically and biologically individuated mechanisms, and the\nstudy of morality will be a detailed inquiry into the nature and\nevolutionary history of these mechanisms.\n4. Normative Definitions of \u201cMorality\u201d\n\nThose who use \u201cmorality\u201d normatively hold that morality is\n(or would be) the behavioral code that meets the following condition:\nall rational persons, under certain specified conditions, would\nendorse it. Indeed, this is a plausible basic schema for definitions\nof \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense. Although some hold\nthat no code could meet the condition, many theorists hold that there\nis one that does; we can call the former \u201cmoral skeptics\u201d\nand the latter \u201cmoral realists\u201d (see entries on LINK:\nmoral skepticism and moral realism).\n\nMany moral skeptics would reject the claim that there are any\nuniversal ethical truths, where the ethical is a broader category than\nthe moral. But another interesting class of moral skeptics includes\nthose who think that we should only abandon the narrower category of\nthe moral\u2014partly because of the notion of a code that\nis central to that category. These moral skeptics hold that we should\ndo our ethical theorizing in terms of the good life, or the virtues.\nElizabeth Anscombe (1958) gave expression to this kind of view, which\nalso finds echoes in the work of Bernard Williams (1985). On the other\nhand, some virtue theorists might take perfect rationality to entail\nvirtue, and might understand morality to be something like the code\nthat such a person would implicitly endorse by acting in virtuous\nways. In that case, even a virtue theorist might count as a moral\nrealist in the sense above.\n\nConsequentialist views might not seem to fit the basic schema for\ndefinitions of \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense, since\nthey do not appear to make reference to the notions of endorsement or\nrationality. But this appearance is deceptive. Mill himself explicitly\ndefines morality as\n\n\nthe rules and precepts for human conduct, by the observance of which\n[a happy existence] might be, to the greatest extent possible,\nsecured. (1861 [2002: 12])\n\n\nAnd he thinks that the mind is not in a \u201cright state\u201d\nunless it is in \u201cthe state most conducive to the general\nhappiness\u201d\u2014in which case it would certainly favor morality\nas just characterized. And the act-consequentialist J.J.C. Smart\n(1956) is also explicit that he is thinking of ethics as the study of\nhow it is most rational to behave. His embrace of utilitarianism is\nthe result of his belief that maximizing utility is always the\nrational thing to do. On reflection it is not surprising that many\nmoral theorists implicitly hold that the codes they offer would be\nendorsed by all rational people, at least under certain conditions.\nUnless one holds this, one will have to admit that, having been shown\nthat a certain behavior is morally required, a rational person might\nsimply shrug and ask \u201cSo what? What is that to me?\u201d And,\nthough some exceptions are mentioned below, very few moral realists\nthink that their arguments leave this option open. Even fewer think\nthis option remains open if we are allowed to add some additional\nconditions beyond mere rationality: a restriction on beliefs, for\nexample (similar to Rawls\u2019 (1971: 118) veil of ignorance), or\nimpartiality.\n\nDefinitions of morality in the normative sense\u2014and,\nconsequently, moral theories\u2014differ in their accounts of\nrationality, and in their specifications of the conditions under which\nall rational persons would necessarily endorse the code of conduct\nthat therefore would count as morality. These definitions and theories\nalso differ in how they understand what it is to endorse a code in the\nrelevant way. Related to these differences, definitions of\n\u201cmorality\u201d\u2014and moral theories\u2014differ with\nregard to those to whom morality applies: that is, those whose\nbehavior is subject to moral judgment. Some hold that morality applies\nonly to those rational beings that have certain specific features of\nhuman beings: features that make it rational for them to endorse\nmorality. These features might, for example, include fallibility and\nvulnerability. Other moral theories claim to put forward an account of\nmorality that provides a guide to all rational beings, even if these\nbeings do not have these human characteristics, e.g., God.\n\nAmong those who use \u201cmorality\u201d normatively, virtually all\nhold that \u201cmorality\u201d refers to a code of conduct that\napplies to all who can understand it and can govern their\nbehavior by it, though many hold that it protects a larger\ngroup. Among such theorists it is also common to hold that morality\nshould never be overridden. That is, it is common to hold that no one\nshould ever violate a moral prohibition or requirement for non-moral\nreasons. This claim is trivial if \u201cshould\u201d is taken to\nmean \u201cmorally should\u201d. So the claim about moral\noverridingness is typically understood with \u201cshould\u201d\nmeaning \u201crationally should\u201d, with the result that moral\nrequirements are asserted to be rational requirements. Though common,\nthis view is by no means always taken as definitional. Sidgwick (1874)\ndespaired of showing that rationality required us to choose\nmorality over egoism, though he certainly did not think rationality\nrequired egoism either. More explicitly, Gert (2005) held that though\nmoral behavior is always rationally permissible, it is not\nalways rationally required. Foot (1972) seems to have held\nthat any reason\u2014and therefore any rational requirement\u2014to\nact morally would have to stem from a contingent commitment or an\nobjective interest. And she also seems to have held that sometimes\nneither of these sorts of reasons might be available, so that moral\nbehavior might not be rationally required for some agents. Finally,\nmoral realists who hold desire-based theories of reasons and formal,\nmeans/end theories of rationality sometimes explicitly deny that moral\nbehavior is always even rationally permissible (Goldman\n2009), and in fact this seems to be a consequence of Foot\u2019s view\nas well, though she does not emphasize it.\n\nDespite the fact that theorists such as Sidgwick, Gert, Foot, and\nGoldman do not hold that moral behavior is rationally required, they\nare by no means precluded from using \u201cmorality\u201d in the\nnormative sense. Using \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense,\nand holding that there is such a thing, only entails holding that\nrational people would put a certain system forward; it does not entail\nholding that rational people would always be motivated to follow that\nsystem themselves. But to the degree that a theorist would deny even\nthe claim about endorsement, and hold instead that rational people\nmight not only fail to act morally, but might even reject it as a\npublic system, that theorist is either not using\n\u201cmorality\u201d in a normative sense, or is denying the\nexistence of morality in that sense. Such a theorist may also be using\n\u201cmorality\u201d in a descriptive sense, or may not have any\nparticular sense in mind.\n\nWhen \u201cmorality\u201d is used in its normative sense, it need\nnot have either of the two formal features that are essential to\nmoralities referred to by the descriptive sense: that it be a code of\nconduct that is put forward by a society, group, or individual, or\nthat it be accepted as a guide to behavior by the members of that\nsociety or group, or by that individual. Indeed, it is possible that\nmorality, in the normative sense, has never been put forward by any\nparticular society, by any group at all, or even by any individual.\nThis is partly a consequence of the fact that \u201cmorality\u201d\nin the normative sense is understood in terms of a conditional that is\nlikely to be counterfactual: it is the code that would be endorsed by\nany fully rational person under certain conditions.\n\nIf one is a moral realist, and one also acknowledges the descriptive\nsense of \u201cmorality\u201d, one may require that descriptive\nmoralities at least approximate, in some ways, morality in the\nnormative sense. That is, one might claim that the guides to behavior\nof some societies lack so many of the essential features of morality\nin the normative sense, that it is incorrect to say that these\nsocieties even have a morality in a descriptive sense. This is an\nextreme view, however. A more moderate position would hold that all\nsocieties have something that can be regarded as their morality, but\nthat many of these moralities\u2014perhaps, indeed, all of\nthem\u2014are defective. That is, a moral realist might hold that\nalthough these actual guides to behavior have enough of the features\nof normative morality to be classified as descriptive moralities, they\nwould not be endorsed in their entirety by all moral agents.\n\nWhile moral realists do not claim that any actual society has or has\never had morality as its actual guide to conduct, \u201cnatural\nlaw\u201d theories of morality claim that any rational person in any\nsociety, even one that has a defective morality, is capable of knowing\nwhat general kinds of actions morality prohibits, requires,\ndiscourages, encourages, and allows. In the theological version of\nnatural law theories, such as that put forward by Aquinas, this is\nbecause God implanted this knowledge in the reason of all persons. In\nthe secular version of natural law theories, such as that put forward\nby Hobbes (1660), natural reason is sufficient to allow all rational\npersons to know what morality prohibits, requires, etc. Natural law\ntheorists also claim that morality applies to all rational persons,\nnot only those now living, but also those who lived in the past.\n\nIn contrast to natural law theories, other moral theories do not hold\nquite so strong a view about the universality of knowledge of\nmorality. Still, many hold that morality is known to all who can\nlegitimately be judged by it. Baier (1958), Rawls (1971) and\ncontractarians deny that there can be an esoteric morality:\none that judges people even though they cannot know what it prohibits,\nrequires, etc. For all of the above theorists, morality is what we can\ncall a public system: a system of norms (1) that is knowable\nby all those to whom it applies and (2) that is not irrational for any\nof those to whom it applies to follow (Gert 2005: 10). Moral judgments\nof blame thus differ from legal or religious judgments of blame in\nthat they cannot be made about persons who are legitimately ignorant\nof what they are required to do. Act consequentialists seem to hold\nthat everyone should know that they are morally required to act so as\nto bring about the best consequences, but even they do not seem to\nthink judgments of moral blame are appropriate if a person is\nlegitimately ignorant of what action would bring about the best\nconsequences (Singer 1993: 228). Parallel views seem to be held by\nrule consequentialists (Hooker 2001: 72).\n\nThe ideal situation for a legal system would be that it be a public\nsystem. But in any large society this is not possible. Games are\ncloser to being public systems and most adults playing a game know its\nrules, or they know that there are judges whose interpretation\ndetermines what behavior the game prohibits, requires, etc. Although a\ngame is often a public system, its rules apply only to those playing\nthe game. If a person does not care enough about the game to abide by\nthe rules, she can usually quit. Morality is the one public system\nthat no rational person can quit. The fact that one cannot quit\nmorality means that one can do nothing to escape being legitimately\nliable to sanction for violating its norms, except by ceasing to be a\nmoral agent. Morality applies to people simply by virtue of their\nbeing rational persons who know what morality prohibits, requires,\netc., and being able to guide their behavior accordingly.\n\nPublic systems can be formal or informal. To say a\npublic system is informal is to say that it has no authoritative\njudges and no decision procedure that provides a unique guide to\naction in all situations, or that resolves all disagreements. To say\nthat a public system is formal is to say that it has one or both of\nthese things (Gert 2005: 9). Professional basketball is a formal\npublic system; all the players know that what the referees call a foul\ndetermines what is a foul. Pickup basketball is an informal public\nsystem. The existence of persistent moral disagreements shows that\nmorality is most plausibly regarded as an informal public system. This\nis true even for such moral theories as the Divine Command theory and\nact utilitarianism, inasmuch as there are no authoritative judges of\nGod\u2019s will, or of which act will maximize utility, and there are\nno decision procedures for determining these things (Scanlon 2011:\n261\u20132). When persistent moral disagreement is recognized, those\nwho understand that morality is an informal public system admit that\nhow one should act is morally unresolvable, and if some resolution is\nrequired, the political or legal system can be used to resolve it.\nThese formal systems have the means to provide unique guides, but they\ndo not provide the uniquely correct moral guide to the action that\nshould be performed.\n\nAn important example of a moral problem left unsettled by the informal\npublic system of morality is whether fetuses are impartially protected\nby morality and so whether or under what conditions abortions are\nallowed. There is continuing disagreement among fully informed moral\nagents about this moral question, even though the legal and political\nsystem in the United States has provided fairly clear guidelines about\nthe conditions under which abortion is legally allowed. Despite this\nimportant and controversial issue, morality, like all informal public\nsystems, presupposes agreement on how to act in most moral situations,\ne.g., all agree that killing or seriously harming any moral agent\nrequires strong justification in order to be morally allowed. No one\nthinks it is morally justified to cheat, deceive, injure, or kill a\nmoral agent simply in order to gain sufficient money to take a\nfantastic vacation. Moral matters are often thought to be\ncontroversial because everyday decisions, about which there is no\ncontroversy, are rarely discussed. The amount of agreement concerning\nwhat rules are moral rules, and on when it is justified to violate one\nof these rules, explains why morality can be a public system even\nthough it is an informal system.\n\nBy using the notion of an informal public system, we can improve the\nbasic schema for definitions of \u201cmorality\u201d in the\nnormative sense. The old schema was that morality is the code\nthat all rational persons, under certain specified conditions, would\nendorse. The improved schema is that morality is the informal\npublic system that all rational persons, under certain specified\nconditions, would endorse. Some theorists might not regard the\ninformal nature of the moral system as definitional, holding that\nmorality might give knowable precise answers to every question. This\nwould have the result that conscientious moral agents often cannot\nknow what morality permits, requires, or allows. Some philosophers\ndeny that this is a genuine possibility.\n\nOn any definition of \u201cmorality\u201d, whether descriptive or\nnormative, it is a code of conduct. However, on ethical- or\ngroup-relativist accounts or on individualistic accounts\u2014all of\nwhich are best regarded as accounts of morality in the descriptive\nsense\u2014morality often has no special content that distinguishes\nit from nonmoral codes of conduct, such as law or religion. Just as a\nlegal code of conduct can have almost any content, as long as it is\ncapable of guiding behavior, and a religious code of conduct has no\nlimits on content, most relativist and individualist accounts of\nmorality place few limits on the content of a moral code. Of course,\nactual codes do have certain minimal limits\u2014otherwise the\nsocieties they characterize would lack the minimum required degree of\nsocial cooperation required to sustain their existence over time. On\nthe other hand, for moral realists who explicitly hold that morality\nis an informal public system that all rational persons would put\nforward for governing the behavior of all moral agents, it has a\nfairly definite content. Hobbes (1660), Mill (1861), and most other\nnon-religiously influenced philosophers in the Anglo-American\ntradition limit morality to behavior that, directly or indirectly,\naffects others.\n\nThe claim that morality only governs behavior that affects others is\nsomewhat controversial, and so probably should not be counted as\ndefinitional of morality, even if it turns out to be entailed by the\ncorrect moral theory. Some have claimed that morality also governs\nbehavior that affects only the agent herself, such as taking\nrecreational drugs, masturbation, and not developing one\u2019s\ntalents. Kant (1785) may provide an account of this wide concept of\nmorality. Interpreted this way, Kant\u2019s theory still fits the\nbasic schema, but includes these self-regarding moral requirements\nbecause of the particular account of rationality he employs. However,\npace Kant, it is doubtful that all moral agents would put\nforward a universal guide to behavior that governs behavior that does\nnot affect them at all. Indeed, when the concept of morality is\ncompletely distinguished from religion, moral rules do seem to limit\ntheir content to behavior that directly or indirectly causes or risks\nharm to others. Some behavior that seems to affect only oneself, e.g.,\ntaking recreational drugs, may have a significant indirect harmful\neffect on others by supporting the illegal and harmful activity of\nthose who benefit from the sale of those drugs.\n\nConfusion about the content of morality sometimes arises because\nmorality is not distinguished sufficiently from religion. Regarding\nself-affecting behavior as governed by morality is supported by the\nidea that we are created by God and are obliged to obey God\u2019s\ncommands, and so may be a holdover from the time when morality was not\nclearly distinguished from religion. This religious holdover might\nalso affect the claim that some sexual practices such as homosexuality\nare immoral. Those who clearly distinguish morality from religion\ntypically do not regard sexual orientation as a moral matter.\n\nIt is possible to hold that having a certain sort of social goal is\ndefinitional of morality (Frankena 1963). Stephen Toulmin (1950) took\nit to be the harmony of society. Baier (1958) took it to be \u201cthe\ngood of everyone alike\u201d. Utilitarians sometimes claim it is the\nproduction of the greatest good. Gert (2005) took it to be the\nlessening of evil or harm. This latter goal may seem to be a\nsignificant narrowing of the utilitarian claim, but utilitarians\nalways include the lessening of harm as essential to producing the\ngreatest good and almost all of their examples involve the avoiding or\npreventing of harm. It is notable that the paradigm cases of moral\nrules are those that prohibit causing harm directly or indirectly,\nsuch as rules prohibiting killing, causing pain, deceiving, and\nbreaking promises. Even those precepts that require or encourage\npositive action, such as helping the needy, are almost always related\nto preventing or relieving harms, rather than promoting goods such as\npleasure.\n\nAmong the views of moral realists, differences in content are less\nsignificant than similarities. For all such philosophers, morality\nprohibits actions such as killing, causing pain, deceiving, and\nbreaking promises. For some, morality also requires charitable\nactions, but failure to act charitably on every possible occasion does\nnot require justification in the same way that any act of killing,\ncausing pain, deceiving, and breaking promises requires justification.\nBoth Kant (1785) and Mill (1861) distinguish between duties of perfect\nobligation and duties of imperfect obligation and regard not harming\nas the former kind of duty and helping as the latter kind of duty. For\nGert (2005), morality encourages charitable action, but does not\nrequire it; it is always morally good to be charitable, but it is not\nimmoral not to be charitable.\n\nEven if the plausible basic schema for definitions of\n\u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense is accepted, one\u2019s\nunderstanding of what morality is, in this sense, will still depend\nvery significantly on how one understands rationality. As has already\nbeen mentioned, morality, in the normative sense, is sometimes taken\nto prohibit certain forms of consensual sexual activity, or the use of\nrecreational drugs. But including such prohibitions in an account of\nmorality as a universal guide that all rational persons would put\nforward requires a very particular view of rationality. After all,\nmany will deny that it is irrational to favor harmless consensual\nsexual activities, or to favor the use of certain drugs for purely\nrecreational purposes.\n\nOne concept of rationality that supports the exclusion of sexual\nmatters, at least at the basic level, from the norms of morality, is\nthat for an action to count as irrational it must be an act that harms\noneself without producing a compensating benefit for\nsomeone\u2014perhaps oneself, perhaps someone else. Such an account\nof rationality might be called \u201chybrid\u201d, since it gives\ndifferent roles to self-interest and to altruism. An account of\nmorality based on the hybrid concept of rationality could agree with\nHobbes (1660) that morality is concerned with promoting people living\ntogether in peace and harmony, which includes obeying the rules\nprohibiting causing harm to others. Although moral prohibitions\nagainst actions that cause harm or significantly increase the risk of\nharm are not absolute, in order to avoid acting immorally,\njustification is always needed when violating these prohibitions. Kant\n(1797) seems to hold that it is never justified to violate some of\nthese prohibitions, e.g., the prohibition against lying. This is\nlargely a result of the fact that Kant\u2019s (1785) concept of\nrationality is purely formal, in contrast with the hybrid concept of\nrationality described above.\n\nMost moral realists who offer moral theories do not bother to offer\nanything like a definition of morality. Instead, what these\nphilosophers offer is a theory of the nature and justification of a\nset of norms with which they take their audience already to be\nacquainted. In effect, they tacitly pick morality out by reference to\ncertain salient and relative uncontroversial bits of its content: that\nit prohibits killing, stealing, deceiving, cheating, and so on. In\nfact, this would not be a bad way of defining morality, if the point\nof such a definition were only to be relatively theory-neutral, and to\nallow theorizing to begin. We could call it \u201cthe\nreference-fixing definition\u201d or \u201cthe substantive\ndefinition\u201d (see Prinz and Nichols 2010: 122).\n\nSome, including Hare (1952, 1963), have been tempted to argue against\nthe possibility of a substantive definition of morality, on the basis\nof the claim that moral disapproval is an attitude that can be\ndirected at anything whatsoever. Foot (1958a, 1958b), argued against\nthis idea, but the substantive definition still has the drawback is\nthat it does not, somehow, seem to get at the essence of morality. One\nmight suggest that the substantive definition has the advantage of\nincluding Divine Command theories of morality, while such theories\nmight seem to make trouble for definitions based on the plausible\nschema given above. But it is plausible to hold that Divine Command\ntheories rest on Natural Law theories, which do in fact fit the\nschema. Divine Command theories that do not rest on Natural Law might\nmake trouble for the schema, but one might also think that such\ntheories rest instead on a confusion, since they seem to entail that\nGod might have made it immoral to act beneficently.\n5. Variations\n\nAs one gives more substance and detail to the general notions of\nendorsement, rationality, and the relevant conditions under which\nrational people would endorse morality, one moves further from\nproviding a definition of morality in the normative sense, and closer\nto providing an actual moral theory. And a similar claim is true for\ndefinitions of morality in the descriptive sense, as one specifies in\nmore detail what one means in claiming that a person or group endorses\na system or code. In the following four subsections, four broad ways\nof making the definitions of morality more precise are presented. They\nare all sufficiently schematic to be regarded as varieties of\ndefinition, rather than as theories.\n5.1 Morality as linked to norms for responses to behavior\n\nExpressivists about morality do not take there to be any objective\ncontent to morality that could underwrite what we above called\n\u201cthe substantive definition\u201d. Rather, they explicitly\nrecognize the existence of significant variation in what rules and\nideals different people put forward as morality in the normative\nsense. And they doubt that this variation is compatible with moral\nrealism. Consequently, they need to offer some unifying features of\nthese different sets of rules and ideals, despite variation in their\ncontent. As a result of this pressure, some expressivists end up\noffering explicit accounts of a distinctively moral attitude\none might hold towards an act token or type. These accounts can of\ncourse be taken to underwrite various forms of morality in the\ndescriptive sense. But they can also be taken to provide the basis of\none form of moral realism.\n\nTo see how an expressivist view can be co-opted by a moral realist of\na certain sort, consider Allan Gibbard\u2019s (1990) moral\nexpressivism. Gibbard holds that moral judgments are expressions of\nthe acceptance of norms for feeling the emotions of guilt and anger.\nOne can accept Gibbard\u2019s view of what it is to endorse a moral\nclaim without accepting the view that, in conflicts, all disagreements\nare faultless. That is, even a moral realist can use Gibbard\u2019s\nview of the nature of moral judgment, and extract from it a definition\nof morality. Used by such a theorist, Gibbard\u2019s view entails\nthat morality, in the normative sense, is the code that is picked out\nby the correct set of norms for feeling guilt and anger: that\nis, the norms a rational person would endorse. This is\nequivalent to accepting the plausible general schema for a definition\nof \u201cmorality\u201d given above, and understanding endorsement\nin a special sense. To endorse a code in the relevant way, on this\ndefinition, is to think that violations of its norms make guilt and\nanger appropriate.\n\nClosely related to Gibbard\u2019s account is one according to which\nthe norms of relevance are not norms for the emotions, but are norms\nfor other reactions to behavior. For example, a person\u2019s\nmorality might be the set of rules and ideals they regard as picked\nout by appropriate norms for praise and blame, and other social\nsanctions (Sprigge 1964: 317). In fact, reference to praise and blame\nmay be more adequate than reference to guilt and anger, since the\nlatter seem only to pick out moral prohibitions, and not to make room\nfor the idea that morality also recommends or encourages certain\nbehaviors even if it does not require them. For example, it is\nplausible that there is such a thing as supererogatory action, and\nthat the specification of what counts as supererogatory is part of\nmorality\u2014whether in the descriptive or normative sense. But it\ndoes not seem likely that we can account for this part of morality by\nappeal to norms for guilt and anger, and it is not at all clear that\nthere are emotions that are as closely linked to supererogation as\nguilt and anger are to moral transgression. On the other hand, it\nseems plausible that norms for praising action might help to pick out\nwhat counts as supererogatory.\n\nAnother version of the present strategy would replace talk of praise\nand blame with talk of reward and punishment. This view would take\nmorality to be a system that explained what kinds of actions are\nappropriately rewarded and\u2014more centrally\u2014punished. This\nsort of view, which remains closely related to Gibbard\u2019s\nsuggestion, can also be regarded as fitting the general schema given\nabove. On this view, the notion of endorsing a code is unpacked in\nterms of the acceptance of norms for reward and punishment. Skorupski\n(1993), following Mill (1861), advocates a definition of morality\nalong these lines, though he then understands punishment primarily in\nterms of blame, and understands blame as very closely linked to\nemotion\u2014indeed, merely having the emotion can count as\nblaming\u2014so that the resulting view is similar to Gibbard\u2019s\nin one important way, at least when one focuses on moral\nwrongness.\n\nIt is certainly plausible that it is appropriate to feel guilt when\none acts immorally, and to feel anger at those who act immorally\ntowards those one cares about. It is even plausible that it is\nonly appropriate, in some particular sense of\n\u201cappropriate\u201d, to feel guilt and anger in connection with\nmoral transgressions. So norms for guilt and anger may well uniquely\npick out certain moral norms. And similar claims might be made about\nnorms for praise and blame. However, it is not equally clear that\nmorality is properly defined in terms of emotions or other\nreactions to behavior. For it may be, as Skorupski emphasizes, that we\nneed to understand guilt and anger, and praise and blame, in terms of\nmoral concepts. This worry about direction of explanation seems less\npressing for the notions of reward and punishment. These responses to\nbehavior, at least in themselves, might simply be understood\nin terms of the meting out of benefits and harms. Of course they will\nonly count as reward and punishment when they are linked to\nsomeone\u2019s having followed or violated a rule that all rational\npeople would want to see enforced by such responses.\n5.2 Morality as linked to advocacy of a code\n\nOne way of understanding the notion of endorsement is as advocacy.\nAdvocating a code is a second- or third-personal matter, since one\nadvocates a code to others. Moreover, it is consistent with advocating\na code, that one does not plan on following that code oneself. Just as\nasserting something one believes to be false still counts as asserting\nit, hypocritical advocacy of a code still counts as advocacy of that\ncode. When endorsement is understood as advocacy, it can be used in\ndefinitions of morality, in the descriptive sense, as long as it is\nthe morality of a group or society. And advocacy can also be used as\nan interpretation of endorsement when providing a definition of\nmorality in the normative sense. Of course those who accept a\ndefinition of morality in any of these senses\u2014as the code that a\ngroup or society endorses, or as the code that would be universally\nadvocated by all rational agents under certain conditions\u2014do not\nhold that the advocacy would necessarily, or even probably, be\nhypocritical. But they do hold that the important thing about a moral\ncode\u2014what picks it out as a moral code\u2014is that it would be\nput forward by all the relevant agents, not that it would be\nfollowed by all of them. The notion of advocacy has less of a\nplace in a descriptive account of a single person\u2019s morality,\nsince when someone is hypocritical we often deny that they really hold\nthe moral view that they advocate.\n\nMill (1861), in addition to offering a moral theory, takes pains to\nexplain how morality differs from other normative systems. For him,\nnorms that simply promote utility are norms of expediency. In order to\nqualify as morally wrong, an act must be one that ought to be\npunished. Thinking that an act of a certain kind ought to be punished\nis a third-personal matter, so it seems plausible to put Mill\u2019s\nview of what is definitional of morality into the category being\ndiscussed in this section. It is worth noting that hypocrisy is, for\nMill, not only a possibility, but\u2014given the present sorry state\nof moral education\u2014virtually unavoidable. That is because being\nmotivated to advocate punishment for a certain kind of act is quite\ndifferent from being motivated to refrain from that same kind of act.\nAdvocating punishment for a certain kind of act might be one\u2019s\nutility-maximizing choice, while actually performing that kind of act\n(trying, of course, to avoid detection) might also be\nutility-maximizing. And for Mill what determines what a person will\nadvocate, and how a person will act, are the foreseeable consequences\nfor that person.\n\nBernard Gert\u2019s (2005) moral view also operates with a definition\nof morality that understands endorsement as advocacy, in the sense of\nputting forward as a guide for all rational agents. Gert offers the\nfollowing two conditions as those under which all rational persons\nwould put forward a universal guide for governing the behavior of all\nmoral agents. The first condition is that they are seeking agreement\nwith all other rational persons or moral agents. The second condition\nis that they use only those beliefs that are shared by all rational\npersons: for example, that they themselves are fallible and vulnerable\nand that all those to whom morality applies are also fallible and\nvulnerable. The second condition rules out both religious beliefs and\nscientific beliefs since there are no religious beliefs or scientific\nbeliefs that all rational persons share. This condition is plausible\nbecause no universal guide to behavior that applies to all rational\npersons can be based on beliefs that some of these rational persons do\nnot share.\n5.3 Morality as linked to acceptance of a code\n\nAnother way of understanding the notion of endorsement is as\nacceptance. Unlike advocating a code, accepting a code is a\nfirst-personal matter. It might include intending to conform\none\u2019s own behavior to that code, feeling guilty when one does\nnot, and so on. One cannot hypocritically accept a code. Indeed,\nhypocrisy is simply a matter of advocating a code one does not accept.\nSo this notion of endorsement is available to someone who is trying to\nprovide a definition of morality in the descriptive sense, even when\nconsidering a single person\u2019s morality.\n\nParadigmatic views in the natural law tradition starting with Aquinas\nhold both that the laws of morality have their source in God, and that\nthese laws constitute the principles of human practical rationality\n(Finnis 1980; MacIntyre 1999). Views in this tradition may be seen as\nusing the basic schema for definitions of morality in the normative\nsense, understanding endorsement as acceptance. Members of this\ntradition typically hold that all rational persons know what kinds of\nactions morality prohibits, requires, discourages, encourages, and\nallows. It is central to Aquinas\u2019s view that morality is known\nto all those whose behavior is subject to moral judgment, even if they\ndo not know of the revelations of Christianity. This is why Aquinas\nholds that knowing what morality prohibits and requires does not\ninvolve knowing why morality prohibits and requires what it does.\n\nThose who belong to the natural law tradition also hold that reason\nendorses acting morally. This sort of endorsement of course has a\ncognitive component. But it is also motivational. Aquinas does not\nhold that knowledge of morality is always effective: it can be blotted\nout by evil persuasions or corrupt habits. But if reason is not\nopposed by such forces, any rational person would not only know what\nwas prohibited and required by morality, but would follow those\nprohibitions and requirements. So, for natural law theorists,\nendorsement amounts to acceptance.\n5.4 Morality as linked to justification to others\n\nThe lack of an explicit and widely accepted definition of morality may\npartially explain the resilience of act-consequentialist accounts of\nmorality. Without an explicit definition, it may be easier to ignore\nthe fact that act-consequentialist theories are not particularly\nconcerned with interpersonal interactions, but typically apply just as\nwell to desert island scenarios as to individuals who live in\nsocieties. In any case, it has been recognized that in order to combat\nconsequentialism, it would be helpful to have something like a\nplausible definition of morality that made it clear that the subject\nmatter of morality is something different from simply the goodness and\nbadness of consequences. T.M. Scanlon (1982, 1998), applying this\nstrategy, suggests that the subject matter of morality\u2014what we\nare talking about, when we talk about morality\u2014is a system of\nrules for the regulation of behavior that is not reasonably rejectable\nbased on a desire for informed unforced general agreement.\n\nScanlon\u2019s suggestion regarding the subject matter of morality\ncan easily be seen as an instance of the general schema given above.\nHis \u201csystem of rules\u201d is a specific kind of informal\npublic system; he understands endorsement by all rational people as\nnon-rejection by all reasonable people; and he offers a specific\naccount of the conditions under which moral agents would reach the\nrelevant agreement. But Scanlon also places very heavy emphasis on the\nfact that if he is right about the subject matter of morality, then\nwhat compliance with moral norms allows us to do is to justify our\nbehavior to others in ways that they cannot reasonably reject. Indeed,\nthe ability to justify ourselves to reasonable people is a primary\nsource of moral motivation for Scanlon (see also Sprigge 1964: 319).\nThis might seem to suggest a somewhat different definitional claim\nabout morality: that morality consists in the most basic norms in\nterms of which we justify ourselves to others. But it is plausible\nthat this purportedly definitional claim is better thought of as a\ncorollary of Scanlon\u2019s particular version of the general schema,\nwith endorsement understood as non-rejection. For, if morality is the\nsystem of norms that would be endorsed in this way, we can justify our\nactions to others by pointing out that even they, were they\nreasonable, would have endorsed rules that allowed our behavior.\n\nStephen Darwall\u2019s (2006) moral view can also be seen as flowing\nfrom a version of the general schema, and yielding claims about\njustifiability to others. Darwall claims that morality is a matter of equal accountability among free and rational beings. On his view, I\nbehave morally towards you to the degree that I respect the claims you\nhave authority to make on me. Darwall also holds that I will respect\nthose claims if I acknowledge certain assumptions to which I am\ncommitted simply in virtue of being a rational, deliberating agent. As\na result, his view is that morality\u2014or at least the morality of\nobligation\u2014is a \u201cscheme of accountability\u201d (a\ncertain sort of informal public system) that all rational people will\nendorse. Unlike Scanlon\u2019s view, however, Darwall\u2019s view\nmakes use of a stronger sense of endorsement than non-rejection.\nSpecifically, it includes the recognition of the reasons provided by\nthe authoritative demands of other people. And that recognition is\npositively motivational.\n\nBoth Scanlon\u2019s and Darwall\u2019s views emphasize the social\nnature of morality, taken in the normative sense: Scanlon, by\nreference to justification to others; Darwall, by appeal to the\nrelevance of second-personal reasons. But Darwall builds a\nresponsiveness to second-personal reasons into the relevant notion of\nrationality, while Scanlon simply makes the empirical claim that many\npeople are motivated by a desire to justify themselves to others, and\nnotes that his definition of morality will yield rules that will allow\none to do this, if one follows them. The sort of definition described\nin\n section 5.1\n also makes the social nature of morality essential to it, since it\ncentrally features the notion of a response to the behavior of others.\nThe definitions described in sections\n 5.2\n and\n 5.3\n do not entail the social nature of morality, since it is\npossible to accept, and even to advocate, a code that concerns only\nself-regarding behavior. But on any plausible account of rationality a\ncode that would be advocated by all moral agents will govern\ninterpersonal interactions, and will include rules that prohibit\ncausing harm without sufficient reason. Only the definition offered in\n section 5.3\n therefore can be taken as realistically compatible with an egoistic\nmorality.\n",
