    "main_text": "Mencius and His Philosophical Opponents\n4. Mencius and His Philosophical Opponents\n\nMencius was often an incisive critic of other philosophers. In\nresponse to a philosopher who advocated price fixing, Mencius asks,\n\u201cIf a fine shoe and a shoddy shoe are the same price, will\nanyone make the former?\u201d (3A4; Van Norden 2008, 73) When the\nsame philosopher suggests that rulers and government officials should\nfarm the land, just like their subjects, Mencius draws an analogy with\nother crafts: just as the potter, blacksmith, and farmer each benefit\nby focusing on his craft and exchanging goods with the others, so does\neveryone benefit when good rulers and officials focus on their own\nactivities in exchange for financial support from the other members of\nsociety (3A4). Another philosopher argues that human nature is\nidentical with the characteristics a human has in virtue of being\nalive. Mencius performs a swift reductio ad absurdum, pointing out\nthat\u2014since dogs, oxen, and humans are the same in being\nalive\u2014the proposed definition entails that dogs, oxen, and\nhumans have the same nature\n (6A3).[17]\n\nMencius viewed himself as a defender of the Confucian tradition, and\nsaw the two major contemporary threats to that tradition as the\ndoctrines of Mozi and Yang Zhu: \u201cthe doctrines of Yang Zhu and\nMozi fill the world. If a doctrine does not lean toward Yang Zhu, then\nit leans toward Mozi. Yang Zhu is \u2018for oneself.\u2019 This is\nto not have a ruler. Mozi is \u2018impartial caring.\u2019 This is\nto not have a father. To not have a father and to not have a ruler is\nto be an animal\u201d (Mengzi 3B9; Van Norden 2008, 85).\nMozi (fifth century BCE) is the first systematic philosophical critic\nof Confucianism. He is generally interpreted as a sort of impartial\nconsequentialist, who grounds ethics in maximizing overall benefit or\nprofit, where this is defined in terms of material goods such as\nwealth, populousness, and social order. On this basis, Mozi criticizes\nthe Confucian emphasis on ritual, regarding as wasteful such Confucian\npractices as elaborate funerals, lengthy mourning periods, and musical\nperformances. In addition, Mozi advocated impartial caring\n(ji\u0101n \u00e0i, sometimes translated \u201cuniversal\nlove\u201d), which he distinguished from the filial piety or\ndifferentiated caring of the Confucians. Mozi argued that caring more\nfor oneself, one\u2019s family, or one\u2019s state was the cause of\nthe warfare and cruelty of his era, and that impartial caring would\nlead to greater harmony and material satisfaction. Mozi certainly did\nnot advocate eliminating the family as a social institution. However,\nhe clearly rejected Confucian differentiated caring in favor of\nimpartial caring: \u201cI have heard that in order to be a superior\nperson in the world, one must regard the well-being of one\u2019s\nfriends as one regards one\u2019s own well being; one must regard the\nparents of one\u2019s friends as one regards one\u2019s own parents.\nOnly in this way can one be a superior person\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van\nNorden 2001, 70). Mozi presented a number of ingenious arguments in\nfavor of his position, including a \u201cstate of nature\u201d\nargument to justify government authority (Mozi 11; Ivanhoe\nand Van Norden 2005,\n 65),[18]\n and a thought-experiment to justify impartial caring that seems\nalmost game-theoretic in its precision (Mozi 16; Ivanhoe and\nVan Norden 2005, 69\u201370). In addition, to win over those\nattracted to Confucianism, Mozi argues that the goal of filial piety\nwill in fact be best achieved by not favoring one\u2019s own parents\nover others: \u201cClearly one must first care for and\nbenefit the parents of others in order to expect that they in turn\nwill respond by caring for and benefiting one\u2019s own parents. And\nso for such mutually filial sons to realize unlimited good results,\nmust they not first care for and benefit other people\u2019s\nparents?\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van Norden, 75; emphasis\n mine)[19]\n Mozi acknowledged that people do not seem to be predisposed to have\nimpartial care for others. However, he argued that human motivations\nare highly malleable, and can be radically altered, so long as humans\nare given appropriate rewards for compliance and punishments for\ndisobedience. As evidence for his claim, he cites the example of\n\nKing Ling of the state of Chu [who] was fond of slender waists. During\nhis reign the people of Chu ate no more than one meal a day and became\nso weak that they could not raise themselves up without the support of\na cane nor could they walk without leaning against a wall. Curtailing\none\u2019s food is something very difficult to do, but masses of\npeople did it in order to please King Ling. Within a single generation\nthe people changed because they wanted to accord with the wishes of\ntheir superior. (Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 75)\n\n\nMozi was not just an original philosophical thinker; he was also the\nfounder of an organized movement, the Mohists, which survived his\ndeath and continued to be influential until the Qin dynasty (221\nBCE\u2013207 BCE) reunified China. \n\nThere is controversy about what the views of Yang Zhu (fifth to fourth\ncentury BCE)\n were.[20]\n However, a plausible case can be made that he defended ethical egoism\nbased on a particular conception of human nature. Yang Zhu\u2019s\nline of argument has considerable plausibility in his philosophical\ncontext. Although Mohists and Confucians disagreed about many things,\nthey agreed on two key points: the proper Way to live and to organize\nsociety is dictated by Heaven, and this Way will sometimes demand\nextreme self\u2013sacrifice of those who follow it. Yang Zhu invoked\nthe notion of \u201chuman nature [r\u00e9n\nx\u00ecng]\u201d to drive a wedge between the former\ncommitment and the latter. Yang Zhu appealed to the fact that nothing\nseems more natural for humans than self\u2013preservation. But if\nthere is a human nature, it must be dictated by Heaven, and therefore\nmust be consistent with the Way. Consequently, following one\u2019s\ninstinct for self\u2013preservation is actually the highest\nexpression of Heaven\u2019s will, and the self\u2013sacrificing\npractices of the Confucians and Mohists are simply perversions of our\nHeaven\u2013given nature. The Mohist response to this, as suggested\nby the example (cited above) of King Ling of Chu, was that there is no\nsuch thing as human nature; human motivations are highly malleable,\nand almost exclusively the products of environmental influences. \n\nMencius\u2019s doctrine that human nature is good was part of his\nstrategy to present a Confucian response to both the Mohists and Yang\nZhu. Mencius agreed with Yang Zhu that humans have a determinate\nnature. However, he presented arguments that there is more to human\nnature than the purely self\u2013interested motivations identified by\nYang Zhu. His most famous argument for this conclusion is the thought\nexperiment of the child at the well:\n\nThe reason why I say that all humans have hearts that are not\nunfeeling toward others is this. Suppose someone suddenly saw a child\nabout to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a\nfeeling of alarm and compassion\u2014not because one sought to get in\ngood with the child\u2019s parents, not because one wanted fame among\none\u2019s neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike\nthe sound of the child\u2019s cries. From this we can see that if one\nis without the feeling of compassion, one is not human.\n(Mengzi 2A6; Van Norden 2008, 46)\n\n\nConsequently, Mencius agreed with Yang Zhu that we are following the\nwill of Heaven (and hence the Way) by following our nature. However,\nhe argued that Yang Zhu had an implausibly impoverished conception of\nwhat human nature is like. \n\nAgainst the Mohists, Mencius argues that human nature places practical\nand ethical constraints on an ethical doctrine. These points are\nexpressed in an argument Mencius has with the Mohist Yi Zhi. Mencius\nasks the rhetorical question, \u201cDoes Yi Zhi truly hold that\none\u2019s affection for one\u2019s own nephew is like one\u2019s\naffection for a neighbor\u2019s baby?\u201d (3A5; Van Norden 2008,\n74) In other words, since humans naturally care more for relatives\nthan for strangers, any ethical system that, like Mohism, demands\nimpartiality will be impractical. Mencius also states, \u201cHeaven,\nin giving birth to things, causes them to have one source, but Yi Zhi\ngives them two sources\u201d (ibid.). In other words, the Mohists\nacknowledge the ethical authority of Heaven (the \u201csource\u201d\nof the Way), but their doctrine of impartial care is set up as a\nsecond \u201csource,\u201d and one that demands deviating from our\nHeaven\u2013endowed nature. In summary, the impartial caring\nadvocated by the Mohists is both perverse and\n impractical.[21]\n\n\nMencius also presents an argument that the Mohist position is\nself\u2013defeating in\n practice.[22]\n When he is politely greeted by a ruler who suggests that Mencius had\ndeigned to visit because he \u201cmust have a way of profiting my\nstate,\u201d Mencius rebukes him:\n\nWhy must Your Majesty speak of \u201cprofit\u201d? Let there simply\nbe benevolence and righteousness. If your majesty says, \u201cHow can\nI profit my state?\u201d the Chief Counselors will say, \u201cHow\ncan I profit my clan?\u201d and the nobles and commoners will say,\n\u201cHow can I profit my self?\u201d Superiors and subordinates\nwill seize profit from each other, and the state will be endangered.\n\u2026 Never have the benevolent left their parents behind. Never\nhave the righteous put their ruler last. Let Your Majesty speak only\nof benevolence and righteousness. Why must one speak of\n\u201cprofit\u201d? (1A1; Van Norden 2008, 1)\n\n\nAlthough the Mohists are not mentioned explicitly in this passage, the\nword \u201cprofit\u201d is central to their formulation of impartial\nconsequentialism, so it is likely that Mencius intended their views as\npart of his target. Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107) concisely summarized\nthe argument here: \u201cA gentleman never fails to desire profit,\nbut if one is single\u2013mindedly focused on profit, then it leads\nto harm. If there is only benevolence and righteousness, then one will\nnot seek profit, but one will never fail to profit\u201d (Van Norden\n2008, 2).\n",
