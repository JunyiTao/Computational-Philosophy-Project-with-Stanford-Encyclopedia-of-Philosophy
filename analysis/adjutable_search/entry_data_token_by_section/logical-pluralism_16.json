    "main_text": "Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism || Pluralism about Modelling\n5.3 Pluralism about Modelling\n\nShapiro and Cook have suggested that the job of a formal logic is to\nmodel a natural language (S. Shapiro 2006, 2014; Cook 2010). Since\nmodels are simplified structures intended to exhibit some but not all\nof the features of the phenomenon being modelled, there may be several\nrival models of the same language, each capturing different aspects of\nthat language. As Shapiro writes:\n\n\n\u2026with mathematical models generally, there is typically no\nquestion of \u201cgetting it exactly right\u201d. For a given\npurpose, there may be bad models\u2014models that are clearly\nincorrect\u2014and there may be good models, but it is\nunlikely that one can speak of one and only one correct model. (S.\nShapiro 2006: 49\u201350, emphasis in original)\n\n\nThis sounds like it might support a species of logical\nnihilism\u2014a view on which there is no correct logic (see\n \u00a73)\u2014but\n Cook prefers to think of it as offering two different kinds of\npluralism. The first, less controversial, kind holds that which logic\nis the correct one is relative to one\u2019s goal. If one wants to\nstudy vagueness, the correct logic might be one that allows for\nintermediate truth-values, whereas if one wants to study identity,\nperhaps first-order classical logic with identity is to be preferred.\nSince the correct model is goal-relative, so is the correct logic.\n\nBut Cook wonders whether his and Shapiro\u2019s logic-as-modelling\nview could also support a more radical pluralism, since it seems\npossible that even relative to a specific purpose, there could be two\nrival logics, each clearly better than all the rest relative to that\npurpose, yet neither of which is better than the other. Under such\ncircumstances Cook thinks we might want to say that both are correct,\nand hence that there is more than one correct logic. However one could\nalso hold that in such circumstances there are two equally good\nlogics, neither of which counts as correct.\n",
