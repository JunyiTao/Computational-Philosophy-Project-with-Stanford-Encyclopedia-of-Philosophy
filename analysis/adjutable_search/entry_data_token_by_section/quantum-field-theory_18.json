    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || The Role of Symmetries\n5.5 Taking Stock: Where do we Stand?\n\nA particle interpretation of QFT answers most intuitively what\nhappens in particle scattering experiments and why we seem to detect\nparticle trajectories. Moreover, it would explain most naturally why\nparticle talk appears almost unavoidable. However, the particle\ninterpretation in particular is troubled by numerous serious\nproblems. There are no-go theorems to the effect that, in a\nrelativistic setting, quantum \u201cparticle\u201d states cannot be\nlocalized in any finite region of space-time no matter how large it\nis. Besides localizability, another hard core requirement for the\nparticle concept that seems to be violated in QFT is\ncountability. First, many take the Unruh effect to indicate that the\nparticle number is observer or context dependent. And second,\ninteracting quantum field theories cannot be interpreted in terms of\nparticles because their representations are unitarily inequivalent to\nFock space (Haag\u2019s theorem), which is the only known way to represent\ncountable entities in systems with an infinite number of degrees of\nfreedom.\n\n\nAt first sight the field interpretation seems to be much better\noff, considering that a field is not a localized entity and that it\nmay vary continuously\u2014so no requirements for localizability and\ncountability. Accordingly, the field interpretation is often taken to\nbe implied by the failure of the particle interpretation. However, on\ncloser scrutiny the field interpretation itself is not above reproach.\nTo begin with, since \u201cquantum fields\u201d are operator valued\nit is not clear in which sense QFT should be describing physical\nfields, i.e., as ascribing physical properties to points in space. In\norder to get determinate physical properties, or even just\nprobabilities, one needs a quantum state. However, since quantum\nstates as such are not spatio-temporally defined, it is questionable\nwhether field values calculated with their help can still be viewed as\nlocal properties. The second serious challenge is that the arguably\nstrongest field interpretation\u2014the wave functional\nversion\u2014may be hit by similar problems as the particle\ninterpretation, since wave functional space is unitarily equivalent to\nFock space.\n\n\nThe occurrence of unitarily inequivalent representations\n(UIRs), which first seemed to cause problems specifically for the\nparticle interpretation but which appears to carry over to the field\ninterpretation, may well be a severe obstacle for any ontological\ninterpretation of QFT. However, it is controversial whether the two\nmost prominent examples, namely the Unruh effect and Haag\u2019s theorem,\nreally do cause the contended problems in the first place. Thus one of\nthe crucial tasks for the philosophy of QFT is further unmasking the\nontological significance of UIRs.\n\n\nThe two remaining contestants approach QFT in a way that breaks more\nradically with traditional ontologies than any of the proposed\nparticle and field interpretations. Ontic Structural Realism\n(OSR) takes the paramount significance of symmetry groups to\nindicate that symmetry structures as such have an ontological primacy\nover objects. However, since most OSRists are decidedly against\nPlatonism, it is not altogether clear how symmetry structures could be\nontologically prior to objects if they only exist in concrete\nrealizations, namely in those objects that exhibit these\nsymmetries.\nDispositional Trope Ontology (DTO) deprives both particles\nand fields of their fundamental status, and proposes an ontology whose\nbasic elements are properties understood as particulars, called\n\u2018tropes\u2019. One of the advantages of the DTO approach is its\ngreat generality concerning the nature of objects which it analyzes as\nbundles of (partly dispositional) properties/tropes: DTO is flexible\nenough to encompass both particle and field like features without\nbeing committed to either a particle or a field ontology.\n\n\nIn conclusion one has to recall that one reason why the ontological\ninterpretation of QFT is so difficult is the fact that it is\nexceptionally unclear which parts of the formalism should be taken to\nrepresent anything physical in the first place. And it looks as if\nthat problem will persist for quite some time.\n\n",
