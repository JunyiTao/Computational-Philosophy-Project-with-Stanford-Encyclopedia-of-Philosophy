    "main_text": "Newton's Life || Newton's Years in London and His Final Years\n2. Newton's Work and Influence\n\n\nThree factors stand in the way of giving an account of Newton's work\nand influence. First is the contrast between the public Newton,\nconsisting of publications in his lifetime and in the decade or two\nfollowing his death, and the private Newton, consisting of his\nunpublished work in math and physics, his efforts in chymistry \u2014\nthat is, the 17th century blend of alchemy and chemistry \u2014 and\nhis writings in radical theology \u2014 material that has become\npublic mostly since World War II. Only the public Newton influenced\nthe eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, yet any account of\nNewton himself confined to this material can at best be only\nfragmentary. Second is the contrast, often shocking, between the\nactual content of Newton's public writings and the positions\nattributed to him by others, including most importantly his\npopularizers.  The term \u201cNewtonian\u201d refers to several\ndifferent intellectual strands unfolding in the eighteenth century,\nsome of them tied more closely to Voltaire, Pemberton, and Maclaurin\n\u2014 or for that matter to those who saw themselves as extending\nhis work, such as Clairaut, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace\n\u2014 than to Newton himself.  Third is the contrast between the\nenormous range of subjects to which Newton devoted his full\nconcentration at one time or another during the 60 years of his\nintellectual career \u2014 mathematics, optics, mechanics, astronomy,\nexperimental chemistry, alchemy, and theology \u2014 and the\nremarkably little information we have about what drove him or his\nsense of himself. Biographers and analysts who try to piece together a\nunified picture of Newton and his intellectual endeavors often end up\ntelling us almost as much about themselves as about Newton.\n\n\nCompounding the diversity of the subjects to which Newton devoted time\nare sharp contrasts in his work within each subject. Optics and\norbital mechanics both fall under what we now call physics, and even\nthen they were seen as tied to one another, as indicated by Descartes'\nfirst work on the subject, Le Monde, ou Trait\u00e9 de la\nlumier\u00e8. Nevertheless, two very different\n\u201cNewtonian\u201d traditions in physics arose from Newton's\nOpticks and Principia: from his Opticks a\ntradition centered on meticulous experimentation and from his\nPrincipia a tradition centered on mathematical theory. The\nmost important element common to these two was Newton's deep\ncommitment to having the empirical world serve not only as the\nultimate arbiter, but also as the sole basis for adopting provisional\ntheory. Throughout all of this work he displayed distrust of what was\nthen known as the method of hypotheses \u2013 putting forward\nhypotheses that reach beyond all known phenomena and then testing them\nby deducing observable conclusions from them. Newton insisted instead\non having specific phenomena decide each element of theory, with the\ngoal of limiting the provisional aspect of theory as much as possible\nto the step of inductively generalizing from the specific\nphenomena. This stance is perhaps best summarized in his fourth Rule\nof Reasoning, added in the third edition of the Principia,\nbut adopted as early as his Optical Lectures of the 1670s:\n\n\nIn experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena\nby induction should be taken to be either exactly or very nearly true\nnotwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena make\nsuch propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions.\n\n\n This rule should be followed so that arguments based on\ninduction may not be nullified by hypotheses.\n\n\n\nSuch a commitment to empirically driven science was a hallmark of\nthe Royal Society from its very beginnings, and one can find it in the\nresearch of Kepler, Galileo, Huygens, and in the experimental efforts\nof the Royal Academy of Paris. Newton, however, carried this\ncommitment further first by eschewing the method of hypotheses and\nsecond by displaying in his Principia and Opticks how\nrich a set of theoretical results can be secured through well-designed\nexperiments and mathematical theory designed to allow inferences from\nphenomena. The success of those after him in building on these\ntheoretical results completed the process of transforming natural\nphilosophy into modern empirical science.\n\n\nNewton's commitment to having phenomena decide the elements of\ntheory required questions to be left open when no available phenomena\ncould decide them. Newton contrasted himself most strongly with\nLeibniz in this regard at the end of his anonymous review of the Royal\nSociety's report on the priority dispute over the calculus:\n\n\nIt must be allowed that these two Gentlemen differ very much in\nPhilosophy. The one proceeds upon the Evidence arising from\nExperiments and Phenomena, and stops where such Evidence is wanting;\nthe other is taken up with Hypotheses, and propounds them, not to be\nexamined by Experiments, but to be believed without Examination.\nThe one for want of Experiments to decide the Question, doth not affirm\nwhether the Cause of Gravity be Mechanical or not Mechanical; the other\nthat it is a perpetual Miracle if it be not Mechanical.\n\n\nNewton could have said much the same about the question of what\nlight consists of, waves or particles, for while he felt that the latter\nwas far more probable, he saw it still not decided by any experiment or\nphenomenon in his lifetime. Leaving questions about the ultimate\ncause of gravity and the constitution of light open was the other\nfactor in his work driving a wedge between natural philosophy and\nempirical science.\n\n\nThe many other areas of Newton's intellectual endeavors made less of a\ndifference to eighteenth century philosophy and science. In\nmathematics, Newton was the first to develop a full range of\nalgorithms for symbolically determining what we now call integrals and\nderivatives, but he subsequently became fundamentally opposed to the\nidea, championed by Leibniz, of transforming mathematics into a\ndiscipline grounded in symbol manipulation. Newton thought the only\nway of rendering limits rigorous lay in extending geometry to\nincorporate them, a view that went entirely against the tide in the\ndevelopment of mathematics in the eighteenth and nineteenth\nceturies. In chemistry Newton conducted a vast array of experiments,\nbut the experimental tradition coming out of his Opticks, and\nnot his experiments in chemistry, lay behind Lavoisier calling himself\na Newtonian; indeed, one must wonder whether Lavoisier would even have\nassociated his new form of chemistry with Newton had he been aware of\nNewton's fascination with writings in the alchemical tradition. And\neven in theology, there is Newton the anti-Trinitarian mild heretic\nwho was not that much more radical in his departures from Roman and\nAnglican Christianity than many others at the time, and Newton, the\nwild religious zealot predicting the end of the Earth, who did not\nemerge to public view until quite recently.\n\n\nThere is surprisingly little cross-referencing of themes from one area\nof Newton's endeavors to another. The common element across almost all\nof them is that of a problem-solver extraordinaire, taking on\none problem at a time and staying with it until he had found, usually\nrather promptly, a solution. All of his technical writings display\nthis, but so too does his unpublished manuscript reconstructing\nSolomon's Temple from the biblical account of it and his posthumously\npublished Chronology of the Ancient Kingdoms in which he\nattempted to infer from astronomical phenomena the dating of major\nevents in the Old Testament. The Newton one encounters in his writings\nseems to compartmentalize his interests at any given moment. Whether\nhe had a unified conception of what he was up to in all his\nintellectual efforts, and if so what this conception might be, has\nbeen a continuing source of controversy among Newton scholars.\n\n\nOf course, were it not for the Principia, there would be no\nentry at all for Newton in an Encyclopedia of Philosophy. In science,\nhe would have been known only for the contributions he made to optics,\nwhich, while notable, were no more so than those made by Huygens and\nGrimaldi, neither of whom had much impact on philosophy; and in\nmathematics, his failure to publish would have relegated his work\nto not much more than a footnote to the achievements of Leibniz and\nhis school. Regardless of which aspect of Newton's endeavors\n\u201cNewtonian\u201d might be applied to, the word gained its aura\nfrom the Principia. But this adds still a further\ncomplication, for the Principia itself was substantially\ndifferent things to different people. The press-run of the first\nedition (estimated to be around 300) was too small for it to have been\nread by all that many individuals. The second edition also appeared in\ntwo pirated Amsterdam editions, and hence was much more widely\navailable, as was the third edition and its English (and later\nFrench) translation. The Principia, however, is not an easy\nbook to read, so one must still ask, even of those who had access to\nit, whether they read all or only portions of the book and to what\nextent they grasped the full complexity of what they read.  The\ndetailed commentary provided in the three volume Jesuit edition\n(1739\u201342) made the work less daunting. But even then the vast majority\nof those invoking the word \u201cNewtonian\u201d were unlikely to\nhave been much more conversant with the Principia itself than\nthose in the first half of the 20th century who invoked\n\u2018relativity\u2019 were likely to have read Einstein's two\nspecial relativity papers of 1905 or his general relativity paper of\n1916. An important question to ask of any philosophers commenting on\nNewton is, what primary sources had they read?\n\n\nThe 1740s witnessed a major transformation in the standing of the\nscience in the Principia. The Principia itself\nhad left a number of loose-ends, most of them detectable by only highly\ndiscerning readers. By 1730, however, some of these loose-ends\nhad been cited in Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's elogium\nfor\n Newton[4] and in\nJohn Machin's appendix to the 1729 English translation of the\nPrincipia, raising questions about just how secure Newton's\ntheory of gravity was, empirically. The shift on the continent began\nin the 1730s when Maupertuis convinced the Royal Academy to conduct\nexpeditions to Lapland and Peru to determine whether Newton's claims\nabout the non-spherical shape of the Earth and the variation of\nsurface gravity with latitude are correct.  Several of the loose-ends\nwere successfully resolved during the 1740's through such notable\nadvances beyond the Principia as Clairaut's\nTh\u00e9orie de la Figure de la Terre; the return of the\nexpedition from Peru; d'Alembert's 1749 rigid-body solution for the\nwobble of the Earth that produces the precession of the equinoxes;\nClairaut's 1749 resolution of the factor of 2 discrepancy between\ntheory and observation in the mean motion of the lunar apogee, glossed\nover by Newton but emphasized by Machin; and the prize-winning first\never successful description of the motion of the Moon by Tobias Mayer\nin 1753, based on a theory of this motion derived from gravity by\nEuler in the early 1750s taking advantage of Clairaut's solution for\nthe mean motion of the apogee.\n\n\nEuler was the central figure in turning the three laws of motion put\nforward by Newton in the Principia into Newtonian\nmechanics. These three laws, as Newton formulated them, apply to\n\u201cpoint-masses,\u201d a term Euler had put forward in his\nMechanica of 1736. Most of the effort of eighteenth century\nmechanics was devoted to solving problems of the motion of rigid\nbodies, elastic strings and bodies, and fluids, all of which require\nprinciples beyond Newton's three laws. From the 1740s on this led to\nalternative approaches to formulating a general mechanics, employing\nsuch different principles as the conservation of vis viva,\nthe principle of least action, and d'Alembert's principle. The\n\u201cNewtonian\u201d formulation of a general mechanics sprang from\nEuler's proposal in 1750 that Newton's second law, in an F=ma\nformulation that appears nowhere in the Principia, could be\napplied locally within bodies and fluids to yield differential\nequations for the motions of bodies, elastic and rigid, and\nfluids. During the 1750s Euler developed his equations for the motion\nof fluids, and in the 1760s, his equations of rigid-body\nmotion. What we call Newtonian mechanics was accordingly something for\nwhich Euler was more responsible than Newton.\n\n\nAlthough some loose-ends continued to defy resolution until much later\nin the eighteenth century, by the early 1750s Newton's theory of\ngravity had become the accepted basis for ongoing research among\nalmost everyone working in orbital astronomy. Clairaut's successful\nprediction of the month of return of Halley's comet at the end of this\ndecade made a larger segment of the educated public aware of the\nextent to which empirical grounds for doubting Newton's theory of\ngravity had largely disappeared. Even so, one must still ask of anyone\noutside active research in gravitational astronomy just how aware they\nwere of the developments from ongoing efforts when they made their\nvarious pronouncements about the standing of the science of the\nPrincipia among the community of researchers. The naivety of\nthese pronouncements cuts both ways: on the one hand, they often\nreflected a bloated view of how secure Newton's theory was at the\ntime, and, on the other, they often underestimated how strong the\nevidence favoring it had become. The upshot is a need to be attentive\nto the question of what anyone, even including Newton himself, had in\nmind when they spoke of the science of the Principia.\n\n\nTo view the seventy years of research after Newton died as merely tying\nup the loose-ends of the Principia or as simply compiling more\nevidence for his theory of gravity is to miss the whole point.\nResearch predicated on Newton's theory had answered a huge number\nof questions about the world dating from long before it. The\nmotion of the Moon and the trajectories of comets were two early\nexamples, both of which answered such questions as how one comet\ndiffers from another and what details make the Moon's motion so\nmuch more complicated than that of the satellites of Jupiter and\nSaturn. In the 1770s Laplace had developed a proper theory of the\ntides, reaching far beyond the suggestions Newton had made in the\nPrincipia by including the effects of the Earth's\nrotation and the non-radial components of the gravitational forces of\nthe Sun and Moon, components that dominate the radial component that\nNewton had singled out. In 1786 Laplace identified a large 900\nyear fluctuation in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn arising from\nquite subtle features of their respective orbits. With this\ndiscovery, calculation of the motion of the planets from the theory of\ngravity became the basis for predicting planet positions, with\nobservation serving primarily to identify further forces not yet taken\ninto consideration in the calculation. These advances in our\nunderstanding of planetary motion led Laplace to produce the four\nprincipal volumes of his Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique\nc\u00e9leste from 1799 to 1805, a work collecting in one place\nall the theoretical and empirical results of the research predicated on\nNewton's Principia. From that time forward,\nNewtonian science sprang from Laplace's work, not\nNewton's.\n\n\nThe success of the research in celestial mechanics predicated on the\nPrincipia was unprecedented. Nothing of comparable scope\nand accuracy had ever occurred before in empirical research of any\nkind. That led to a new philosophical question: what was it about\nthe science of the Principia that enabled it to achieve what\nit did? Philosophers like Locke and Berkeley began asking this\nquestion while Newton was still alive, but it gained increasing force\nas successes piled on one another over the decades after he died.\nThis question had a practical side, as those working in other fields\nlike chemistry pursued comparable success, and others like Hume and\nAdam Smith aimed for a science of human affairs. It had, of\ncourse, a philosophical side, giving rise to the subdiscipline of\nphilosophy of science, starting with Kant and continuing throughout the\nnineteenth century as other areas of physical science began showing\nsimilar signs of success. The Einsteinian revolution in the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, in which Newtonian theory was shown\nto hold only as a limiting case of the special and general theories of\nrelativity, added a further twist to the question, for now all the\nsuccesses of Newtonian science, which still remain in place, have to be\nseen as predicated on a theory that holds only to high approximation in\nparochial circumstances.\n\n\nThe extraordinary character of the Principia gave rise\nto a still continuing tendency to place great weight on everything\nNewton said. This, however, was, and still is, easy to carry to\nexcess. One need look no further than Book 2 of the\nPrincipia to see that Newton had no more claim to being\nsomehow in tune with nature and the truth than any number of his\ncontemporaries. Newton's manuscripts do reveal an exceptional\nlevel of attention to detail of phrasing, from which we can rightly\nconclude that his pronouncements, especially in print, were\ngenerally backed by careful, self-critical reflection.\nBut this conclusion does not automatically extend to every statement he\never made. We must constantly be mindful of the possibility of\ntoo much weight being placed, then or now, on any pronouncement that\nstands in relative isolation over his 60 year career; and, to counter\nthe tendency to excess, we should be even more vigilant than usual in\nnot losing sight of the context, circumstantial as well as historical\nand textual, of both Newton's statements and the eighteenth century\nreaction to\nthem.\n",
