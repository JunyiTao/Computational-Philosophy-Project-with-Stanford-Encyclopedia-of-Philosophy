    "main_text": "Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre || Philosophy of Nature\n4.2 Philosophy of Nature\n\nHaving established the foundation of his new system, Fichte then\nturned to the task of constructing upon this foundation a\nfully-articulated transcendental system, the overall structure of\nwhich is most clearly outlined in the concluding section of the\ntranscripts of his lectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova\nmethodo. According to this plan, which has no analog in\nFichte\u2019s later writings, the Entire Wissenschaftslehre\nis to consisting of four, systematically interrelated parts:: (1)\nfirst philosophy, which corresponds to the \u201cfoundational\u201d\nportion of the system, as presented in the Foundation of the\nentire Wissenschaftslehre and revised in the lectures on\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo; (2) \u201ctheoretical\nphilosophy\u201d or \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d (3)\n\u201cpractical philosophy\u201d or ethics (corresponding to the\ncontent of the System of Ethics); and (4) \u201cphilosophy\nof the postulates,\u201d which includes the subdisciplines of\n\u201cnatural law\u201d or \u201ctheory of right\u201d (as\nexpounded in the Foundation of Natural Right) and philosophy\nof religion.\n\nBy \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d Fichte seems to have had in\nmind something similar to Kant\u2019s Metaphysical First\nPrinciples of Nature, though Fichte himself devoted very little\nattention to the execution of such a project. The closest he ever came\nto developing a philosophy of nature according to transcendental\nprinciples is the compressed account of space, time, and matter\npresented in the Outline of the Distinctive Character of the\nWissenschaftslehre with Respect to the Theoretical Faculty and\nthe lectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova methodo. In neither\nof these works, however, does he make any effort to distinguish\nrigorously between the \u201ctheoretical\u201d aspect of the\nfoundational portion of his system and a distinctively\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d subdivision of the same (\u201cphilosophy\nof nature\u201d). In fact, a \u201cphilosophy of nature in\naccordance with the principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre\u201d turns out to me even more modest\nthan Kant\u2019s and more closely resembles what later came to be\ncalled the philosophy of (natural) science than it does the\nspeculative Naturphilosophie of Schelling and Hegel. Indeed,\ndisagreement concerning the compatibility of a rigorously\ntranscendental philosophy with a speculative, a priori\n\u201cphilosophy of nature\u201d was the very issue that\nprecipitated the rift between Fichte and his erstwhile disciple,\nSchelling. The popular picture of Fichte\u2019s attitude toward\nnature, namely, that he viewed the latter almost entirely from the\nperspective of human projects, that is, as the necessary realm for\nmoral striving, is therefore very close to the truth.\n",
