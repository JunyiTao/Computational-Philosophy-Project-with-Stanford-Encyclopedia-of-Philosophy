    "main_text": "Human Nature, the Participant Perspective and Morality\n5. Human Nature, the Participant Perspective and Morality\n5.1. Human Nature from a Participant Perspective\n\nIn such a culture-mind coevolutionary account, there may be a place\nfor the referents of some of the traditional philosophical slogans\nintended to pin down \u201cthe human essence\u201c or \u201chuman\nnature\u201d\u2014reason, linguistic capacity (\u201cthe\nspeaking animal\u201d, Herder 1772 [2008: 97]), a more general\nsymbolic capacity (animal symbolicum, Cassirer 1944: 44),\nfreedom of the will (Pico della Mirandola 1486 [1965: 5]; Sartre 1946\n[2007: 29, 47]), a specific, \u201cpolitical\u201d form of\nsociality, or a unique type of moral motivation (Hutcheson 1730:\n\u00a715). These are likely, at best, to be the (still evolving)\nproducts in contemporary humans of processes set in motion by a trait\nconstellation that includes proto-versions of (some of) these\ncapacities. Such a view may also be compatible with an account of\n\u201cwhat contemporary humans are like\u201d that abstracts from\nthe evolutionary time scale of eons and focuses instead on the present\n(cf. Dupr\u00e9 1993: 43), whilst neither merely cataloguing widely\ndistributed traits\n (\u00a73.2)\n nor attempting explanations in terms of the human genome\n (\u00a74.1).\n The traditional slogans appear to be attempts to summarise some such\naccounts. It seems clear, though, that their aims are significantly\ndifferent from those of the biologically, or otherwise scientifically\norientated positions thus far surveyed.\n\nTwo features of such accounts are worth emphasising, both of which we\nalready encountered in Aristotle\u2019s contribution to the original\npackage. The first involves a shift in perspective from that of the\nscientific observer to that of a participant in a\ncontemporary human life form. Whereas the human\u2014or\nnon-human\u2014biologist may ask what modern humans are like, just as\nthey may ask what bonobos are like, the question that traditional\nphilosophical accounts of human nature are plausibly attempting to\nanswer is what it is like to live one\u2019s life as a contemporary\nhuman. This question is likely to provoke the counter-question as to\nwhether there is anything that it is like to live simply as a\ncontemporary human, rather than as a\nhuman-in-a-specific-historical-and-cultural context (Habermas 1958:\n32; Geertz 1973: 52f.; Dupr\u00e9 2003: 110f.). For the traditional\nsloganeers, the answer is clearly affirmative. The second feature of\nsuch accounts is that they tend to take it that reference to the\ncapacities named in the traditional slogans is in some sense\nnormatively, in particular, ethically\nsignificant.\n\nThe first claim of such accounts, then, is that there is some property\nof contemporary humans that is in some way descriptively or causally\ncentral to participating in their form of life. The second is that\nsuch participation involves subjection to normative standards rooted\nin the possession of some such property. Importantly, there is a step\nfrom the first to the second form of significance, and justification\nof the step requires argument. Even from a participant perspective,\nthere is no automatic move from explanatory to normative\nsignificance.\n\nAccording to an \u201cinternal\u201d, participant account of human\nnature, certain capacities of contemporary, perhaps modern humans\nunavoidably structure the way they (we) live their (our)\nlives. Talk of \u201cstructuring\u201d refers to three kinds of\ncontributions to the matrix of capacities and dispositions that both\nenable and constrain the ways humans live their lives. These are\ncontributions, first, to the specific shape other features of humans\nlives have and, second, to the way other such features hang together\n(Midgley 2000: 56ff.; Roughley 2011: 16ff.). Relatedly, they also make\npossible a whole new set of practices. All three relations are\nexplanatory, although their explanatory role appears not necessarily\nto correspond to the role corresponding features, or earlier versions\nof the features, might have played in the evolutionary genealogy of\ncontemporary human psychology. Having linguistic capacities is a prime\ncandidate for the role of such a structural property: human\nperception, emotion, action planning and thought are all plausibly\ntransformed in linguistic creatures, as are the connections between\nperception and belief, and the myriad relationships between thought\nand behaviour, connections exploited and deepened in a rich set of\npractices unavailable to non-linguistic animals. Similar things could\nbe claimed for other properties named by the traditional slogans.\n\nIn contrast to the ways in which such capacities have frequently been\nreferred to in the slogan mode, particularly to the pathos that has\ntended to accompany it, it seems highly implausible that any one such\nproperty will stand alone as structurally significant. It is more\nlikely that we should be picking out a constellation of properties, a\nconstellation that may well include properties variants of which are\npossessed by other animals. Other properties, including capacities\nthat may be specific to contemporary humans, such as humour, may be\nless plausible candidates for a structural role.\n\nNote that the fact that such accounts aim to answer a question asked\nfrom the participant perspective does not rule out that the features\nin question may be illuminated in their role for human\nself-understanding by data from empirical science. On the contrary, it\nseems highly likely that disciplines such as developmental and\ncomparative psychology, and neuroscience will contribute significantly\nto an understanding of the possibilities and constraints inherent in\nthe relevant capacities and in the way they interact.\n5.2. Human Nature and the Human ergon\n\nThe paradigmatic strategy for deriving ethical consequences from\nclaims about structural features of the human life form is the\nPlatonic and Aristotelian ergon or function argument. The\nfirst premise of Aristotle\u2019s version (Nicomachean\nEthics 1097b\u20131098a) connects function and goodness: if the\ncharacteristic function of an entity of a type X is to \u03c6,\nthen a good entity of type X is one that \u03c6s well. Aristotle\nconfers plausibility on the claim by using examples such as social\nroles and bodily organs. If the function of an eye as an exemplar of\nits kind is to enable seeing, then a good eye is one that enables its\nbearer to see well. The second premise of the argument is a claim we\nencountered in\n section 1.4\n of this entry, a claim we can now see as predicating a structural\nproperty of human life, the exercise of reason. According to this\nclaim, the function or end of individual humans as humans is,\ndepending on interpretation (Nussbaum 1995: 113ff.), either the\nexercise of reason or life according to reason. If this is correct, it\nfollows that a good human being is one whose life centrally involves\nthe exercise of, or life in accordance with, reason.\n\nIn the light of the discussion so far, it ought to be clear that, as\nit stands, the second premise of this argument is incompatible with\nthe evolutionary biology of species. It asserts that the exercise of\nreason is not only the key structural property of human life, but also\nthe realization of the fully developed human form. No sense can be\nmade of this latter notion in evolutionary terms. Nevertheless, a\nseries of prominent contemporary ethicists\u2014Alasdair MacIntyre\n(1999), Rosalind Hursthouse (1999), Philippa Foot (2001) and Martha\nNussbaum (2006)\u2014have all made variants of the ergon\nargument central to their ethical theories. As each of these authors\nadvance some version of the second premise, it is instructive to\nexamine the ways in which they aim to avoid the challenge from\nevolutionary biology.\n\nBefore doing so, it is first worth noting that any ethical theory or\ntheory of value is engaged in an enterprise that has no clear place in\nan evolutionary analysis. If we want to know what goodness is or what\n\u201cgood\u201d means, evolutionary theory is not the obvious place\nto look. This is particularly clear in view of the fact that\nevolutionary theory operates at the level of populations (Sober 1980:\n370; Walsh 2006: 434), whereas ethical theory operates, at least\nprimarily, at the level of individual agents. However, the specific\nconflict between evolutionary biology and neo-Aristotelian ethics\nresults from the latter\u2019s constructive use of the concept of\nspecies and, in particular, of a teleological conception of a fully\ndeveloped form of individual members of the species\n\u201cqua members of [the] species\u201d (MacIntyre 1999:\n64, 71; cf. Thompson 2008: 29; Foot 2001: 27). The characterisation of\nachieving that form as fulfilling a \u201cfunction\u201d, which\nhelps the analogy with bodily organs and social roles, is frequently\nreplaced in contemporary discussions by talk of\n\u201cflourishing\u201d (Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonia).\nSuch talk more naturally suggests comparisons with the lives of other\norganisms (although Aristotle himself excludes other animals from\neudaimonia; cf. Nicomachean Ethics 1009b). The\nconcept of flourishing in turn picks out\nbiological\u2014etymologically: botanical\u2014processes, but again\nnot of a sort that play a role in evolutionary theory. It also seems\nprimarily predicated of individual organisms. It may play a role in\necology; it is, however, most clearly at home in practical\napplications of biological knowledge, as in horticulture. In this\nrespect, it is comparable to the concept of health.\n\nNeo-Aristotelians claim that to describe an organism, whether a plant\nor a non-human or human animal, as flourishing is to measure it\nagainst a standard that is specific to the species to which it\nbelongs. To do so is to evaluate it as a more or less good\n\u201cspecimen of its species (or sub-species)\u201d (Hursthouse\n1999: 198). The key move is then to claim that moral evaluation is,\n\u201cquite seriously\u201d (Foot 2001: 16), evaluation of the same\nsort: just as a non-defective animal or plant exemplifies flourishing\nwithin the relevant species\u2019 life form, someone who is morally\ngood is someone who exemplifies human flourishing, i.e., the fully\ndeveloped form of the species. This metaethical claim has provoked the\nworry as to whether such attributions to other organisms are really\nanything more than classifications, or at most evaluations of\n\u201cstretched and deflated\u201d kinds that are missing the key\nfeature of authority that we require for genuine normativity (Lenman\n2005: 46ff.).\n5.2.1. Sidestepping the Darwinian Challenge?\n\nIndependently of questions concerning their theory of value, ethical\nNeo-Aristotelians need to respond to the question of how reference to\na fully developed form of the species can survive the challenge from\nevolutionary theory. Three kinds of response may appear promising.\n\nThe first adverts to the plurality of forms of biological\nscience, claiming that there are life sciences, such as physiology,\nbotany, zoology and ethology in the context of which such evaluations\nhave a place (Hursthouse 1999: 202; 2012: 172; MacIntyre 1999: 65).\nAnd if ethology can legitimately attribute not only characteristic\nfeatures, but also defects or flourishing to species members, in spite\nof species not being natural kinds, then there is little reason why\nethics shouldn\u2019t do so too. This strategy might ground in one of\nthe moves sketched in\n section 3.1\n of this entry. It might be argued, with Kitcher and Dupr\u00e9,\nthat such attributions are legitimate in other branches of biological\nscience because there is a plurality of species concepts, indeed of\nkinds of species, where these are relative to epistemic interests. Or\nthe claim might simply rest on a difference in what is taken to be the\nrelevant time frame, where temporal relevance is indexed relative to\nthe present. In ethics we are, it might be claimed, interested in\nhumans as they are \u201cat the moment and for a few millennia back\nand for maybe not much longer in the future\u201d (Hursthouse 2012:\n171).\n\nThis move amounts to the concession that talk of \u201cthe human\nspecies\u201d is not to be understood literally. Whether this\nconcession undermines the ethical theories that use the term is\nperhaps unclear. It leaves open the possibility that, as human nature\nmay change significantly, there may be significant changes in what it\nmeans for humans to flourish and therefore in what is ethically\nrequired. This might be seen as a virtue, rather than a vice of the\nview.\n\nA second response to the challenge from evolutionary biology\naims to draw metaphysical consequences from epistemic or semantic\nclaims. Michael Thompson has argued that what he calls alternatively\n\u201cthe human life form\u201d and \u201cthe human species\u201d\nis an a priori category. Thompson substantiates this claim by\nexamining forms of discourse touched on in\n section 3.2,\n forms of discourse that are generally taken to be of mere heuristic\nimportance for amateur practices of identification, viz. field guides\nor animal documentaries. Statements such as \u201cThe domestic cat\nhas four legs, two eyes, two ears and guts in its belly\u201d, are,\nThompson claims, instances of an important kind of predication that is\nneither tensed nor quantifiable. He calls these \u201cnatural\nhistorical descriptions\u201d or \u201cAristotelian\ncategoricals\u201d (Thompson 2008: 64ff.). Such generic claims are\nnot, he argues, made false where what is predicated is less than\nuniversal, or even statistically rare. Decisively, according to\nThompson, our access to the notion of the human life form is\nnon-empirical. It is, he claims, a presupposition of understanding\nourselves from the first-person perspective as breathing, eating or\nfeeling pain (Thompson 2004: 66ff.). Thus understood, the concept is\nindependent of biology and therefore, if coherent, immune to problems\nraised by the Darwinian challenge.\n\nLike Foot and Hursthouse, Thompson thinks that his Aristotelian\ncategoricals allow inferences to specific judgments that members of\nspecies are defective (Thompson 2004: 54ff.; 2008: 80). He admits that\nsuch judgments in the case of the human life form are likely to be\nfraught with difficulties, but nevertheless believes that judgments of\n(non-)defective realization of a life form are the model for ethical\nevaluation (Thompson 2004: 30, 81f.). It may seem unclear how this\nmight be the case in view of the fact that access to the human life\nform is supposed to be given as a presupposition of using the concept\nof \u201cI\u201d. Another worry is that the everyday understanding\non which Thompson draws may be nothing other than a branch of folk\nbiology. The folk tendency to ascribe teleological essences to\nspecies, as to \u201craces\u201d and genders, is no indication of\nthe reality of such essences (Lewens 2012: 469f.; Stotz &\nGriffiths 2018: 60ff.; cf. Pellegrin 1982 [1986: 16ff., 120] and\nCharles 2000: 343ff., 368, on Aristotle\u2019s own orientation to the\nusage of \u201cthe people\u201d).\n\nA final response to evolutionary biologists\u2019 worries\naims equally to distinguish the Neo-Aristotelian account of human\nnature from that of the sciences. However, it does so not by\nintroducing a special metaphysics of \u201clife forms\u201d, but by\nexplicitly constructing an ethical concept of human nature. Martha\nNussbaum argues that the notion of human nature in play in what she\ncalls \u201cAristotelian essentialism\u201d is, as she puts it,\n\u201cinternal and evaluative\u201d. It is a hermeneutic product of\n\u201chuman\u201d self-understanding, constructed from within our\nbest ethical outlook: \u201can ethical theory of human nature\u201d,\nshe claims,\n\n\nshould force us to answer for ourselves, on the basis of our very own\nethical judgment, the question which beings are fully human ones.\n(Nussbaum 1995: 121f.; cf. Nussbaum 1992: 212ff.; 2006: 181ff.;\nMcDowell 1980 [1998: 18ff.]; Hursthouse 1999: 229; 2012: 174f.)\n\n\nThere can be no question here of moving from a biological\n\u201cis\u201d to an ethical \u201cought\u201d; rather, which\nfeatures are taken to belong to human nature is itself seen as the\nresult of ethical deliberation. Such a conception maintains the claim\nthat the key ethical standard is that of human flourishing. However,\nit is clear that what counts as flourishing can only be specified on\nthe basis of ethical deliberation, understood as striving for\nreflective equilibrium (Nussbaum 2006: 352ff.). In view of such a\nmethodological proposal, there is a serious question as to what work\nis precisely done by the concept of human nature.\n5.2.2. Human Flourishing\n\nNeo-Aristotelians vary in the extent to which they flesh out a\nconception of species-specific flourishing. Nussbaum draws up a\ncomprehensive, open-ended catalogue of what she calls \u201cthe\ncentral human capacities\u201d. These are in part picked out because\nof their vulnerability to undermining or support by political\nmeasures. They include both basic bodily needs and more specifically\nhuman capacities, such as for humour, play, autonomy and practical\nreason (Nussbaum 1992: 216ff.; 2006: 76ff.). Such a catalogue allows\nthe setting of three thresholds, below which a human organism would\nnot count as living a human life at all (anencephalic\nchildren, for instance), as living a fully human life or as\nliving a good human life (Nussbaum 2006: 181). Nussbaum\nexplicitly argues that being of human parents is insufficient for\ncrossing the first, evaluatively set threshold. Her conception is\npartly intended to provide guidelines as to how societies should\nconceive disability and as to when it is appropriate to take political\nmeasures in order to enable agents with nonstandard physical or mental\nconditions to cross the second and third thresholds.\n\nNussbaum has been careful to insist that enabling independence, rather\nthan providing care, should be the prime aim. Nevertheless, the\nstructure of an account that insists on a \u201cspecies norm\u201d,\nbelow which humans lacking certain capacities count as less than fully\nflourishing, has prompted accusations of illiberality. According to\nthe complaint, it disrespects the right of members of, for example,\ndeaf communities to set the standards for their own forms of life\n(Glackin 2016: 320ff.).\n\nOther accounts of species-specific flourishing have been considerably\nmore abstract. According to Hursthouse, plants flourish when their\nparts and operations are well suited to the ends of individual\nsurvival and continuance of the species. In social animals,\nflourishing also tends to involve characteristic pleasure and freedom\nfrom pain, and a contribution to appropriate functioning of relevant\nsocial groups (Hursthouse 1999: 197ff.). The good of human character\ntraits conducive to pursuit of these four ends is transformed,\nHursthouse claims, by the addition of \u201crationality\u201d. As a\nresult, humans flourish when they do what they correctly take\nthemselves to have reason to do\u2014under the constraint that they\ndo not thereby cease to foster the four ends set for other social\nanimals (Hursthouse 1999: 222ff.). Impersonal benevolence is, for\nexample, because of this constraint, unlikely to be a virtue. In such\nan ethical outlook, what particular agents have reason to do is the\nprimary standard; it just seems to be applied under particular\nconstraints. A key question is thus whether the content of this\nprimary standard is really determined by the notion of\nspecies-specific flourishing.\n\nWhere Hursthouse\u2019s account builds up to, and attempts to provide\na \u201cnatural\u201d framework for, the traditional Aristotelian\nergon of reason, MacIntyre builds his account around the\nclaim that flourishing specific to the human \u201cspecies\u201d is\nessentially a matter of becoming an \u201cindependent practical\nreasoner\u201d (MacIntyre 1999: 67ff.). It is because of the central\nimportance of reasoning that, although human flourishing shares\ncertain preconditions with the flourishing, say, of dolphins, it is\nalso vulnerable in specific ways. MacIntyre argues that particular\nkinds of social practices enable the development of human reasoning\ncapacities and that, because independent practical reasoning is,\nparadoxically, at core cooperatively developed and structured, the\ngeneral aim of human flourishing is attained by participation in\nnetworks in local communities (MacIntyre 1999: 108).\n\u201cIndependent practical reasoners\u201d are \u201cdependent\nrational animals\u201d. MacIntyre\u2019s account thus makes room on\nan explanatory level for the evolutionary insight that humans can only\nbecome rational in a socio-cultural context which provides scaffolding\nfor the development and exercise of rationality\n (\u00a74).\n Normatively, however, this point is subordinated to the claim that,\nfrom the point of view of participation in the contemporary human life\nform, flourishing corresponds to the traditional slogan.\n5.3. Reason as the Unique Structural Property\n\nMacIntyre, Hursthouse and Nussbaum (Nussbaum 2006: 159f.) all aim to\nlocate the human capacity for reasoning within a framework that\nencompasses other animals. Each argues that, although the capacities\nto recognise reasons as reasons and for deliberation on their basis\ntransform the needs and abilities humans share with other animals, the\nreasons in question remain in some way dependent on humans\u2019\nembodied and social form of life. This emphasis is intended to\ndistinguish an Aristotelian approach from other approaches for which\nthe capacity to evaluate reasons for action as reasons and to distance\noneself from ones desires is also the \u201ccentral difference\u201d\nbetween humans and other animals (Korsgaard 2006: 104; 2018: 38ff.;\ncf. MacIntyre 1999: 71ff.). According to Korsgaard\u2019s Kantian\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s ergon argument, humans\ncannot act without taking a normative stand on whether their desires\nprovide them with reasons to act. This she takes to be the key\nstructural feature of their life, which brings with it \u201ca whole\nnew way of functioning well or badly\u201d (Korsgaard 2018: 48; cf.\n1996: 93). In such an account, \u201chuman nature\u201d is\nmonistically understood as this one structural feature which is so\ntransformative that the concept of life applicable to organisms that\ninstantiate it is no longer that applicable to organisms that\ndon\u2019t. Only \u201chumans\u201d live their lives,\nbecause only they possess the type of intentional control over their\nbodily movements that grounds in evaluation of their actions and\nself-evaluation as agents (Korsgaard 2006: 118; 2008: 141ff.; cf.\nPlessner 1928 [1975: 309f.]).\n\nWe have arrived at an interpretation of the traditional slogan that\ncuts it off from a metaphysics with any claims to be\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d. The claim now is that the structural\neffect of the capacity for reasoning transforms those features of\nhumans that they share with other animals so thoroughly that those\nfeatures pale into insignificance. What is \u201cnatural\u201d about\nthe capacity for reasoning for humans here is its unavoidability for\ncontemporary members of the species, at least for those without\nserious mental disabilities. Such assertions also tend to shade into\nnormative claims that discount the normative status of\n\u201canimal\u201d needs in view of the normative authority of human\nreasoning (cf. McDowell 1996 [1998: 172f.]).\n\nThe most radical version of this thought leads to the claim\nencountered towards the end of\n section 1.4:\n that talk of \u201chuman nature\u201d involves no essential\nreference at all to the species Homo sapiens or to the\nhominin lineage. According to this view, the kind to which\ncontemporary humans belong is a kind to which entities could also\nbelong who have no genealogical relationship to humans. That kind is\nthe kind of entities that act and believe in accordance with the\nreasons they take themselves to have. Aliens, synthetically created\nagents and angels are further candidates for membership in the kind,\nwhich would, unlike biological taxa, be spatiotemporally unrestricted.\nThe traditional term for the kind, as employed by Aquinas and Kant, is\n\u201cperson\u201d (cf. Hull 1986: 9).\n\nRoger Scruton has recently taken this line, arguing that persons can\nonly be adequately understood in terms of a web of concepts\ninapplicable to other animals, concepts whose applicability grounds in\nan essential moral dimension of the personal life form. The concepts\npick out components of a life form that is permeated by relationships\nof responsibility, as expressed in reactive attitudes such as\nindignation, guilt and gratitude. Such emotions he takes to involve a\ndemand for accountability, and as such to be exclusive to the personal\nlife form, not variants of animal emotions (Scruton 2017: 52). As a\nresult, he claims, they situate their bearers in some sense\n\u201coutside the natural order\u201d (Scruton 2017: 26). According\nto such an account, we should embrace a methodological dualism with\nrespect to humans: as animals, they are subject to the same kinds of\nbiological explanations as all other organisms, but as persons, they\nare subject to explanations that are radically different in kind.\nThese are explanations in terms of reasons and meanings, that is,\nexercises in \u201cVerstehen\u201d, whose applicability Scruton\ntakes to be independent of causal explanation (Scruton 2017: 30ff.,\n46).\n\nSuch an account demonstrates with admirable clarity that there is no\nnecessary connection between a theory of \u201chuman nature\u201d\nand metaphysical naturalism. It also reinforces the fact, emphasised\nthroughout this entry, that discussions of \u201chuman nature\u201d\nrequire both serious conceptual spadework and explicit justification\nof the use of any one such concept rather than another.",
