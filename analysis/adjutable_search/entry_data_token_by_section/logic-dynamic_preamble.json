    "main_text": "\n\nLogics of programs are modal logics arising from the idea of\nassociating a modality \\([\\alpha]\\) with each computer program\n\\(\\alpha\\) of a programming language. The formula \\([\\alpha]A\\) is\nthen to be read as: \\(A\\) is true after the execution of the program\n\\(\\alpha\\). This idea comes from the line of works by Engeler [1967],\nHoare [1969], Yanov [1959], and others who formulated and studied\nlogical languages in which the properties of program connectives can\nbe expressed. The algorithmic logic (AL) first developed by Salwicki\n[1970] and the dynamic logic (DL) elaborated by Pratt [1976] are\nproper continuations of these works. We will here concentrate on DL.\nThe numerous papers devoted to DL and its variants as well as its many\napplications in program verification and data structures show that it\nconstitutes a useful tool for studying the properties of programs.\nPratt chose to depict DL on what one might call the first-order level,\nand it was his work that triggered Fischer and Ladner [1979] to define\nthe propositional variant of DL a couple of years later. This article\npresents an introduction to PDL, the propositional variant of DL.\n",
