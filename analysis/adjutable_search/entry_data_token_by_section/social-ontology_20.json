    "main_text": "Key Domains Addressed by Social Ontology || Group Minds, Collective Intentionality, and Group Agency\n5.2 Group Minds, Collective Intentionality, and Group Agency\n\nCan groups take actions? Can they have intentions or beliefs? Can they\nbear responsibility? If so, how are these to be understood? Through\nmuch of the twentieth century ascriptions of intentions and actions to\ngroups were widely regarded as either erroneous or else merely\n\u201csummative\u201d: that is, for a group to have an intention or\ntake an action is merely for all the members of the group to have that\nintention or take that action (see Tollefsen 2015).\n\nSchweikard and Schmid (see entry on\n collective intentionality)\n find more nuanced approaches in Scheler 1913 and Walther 1923.\nScheler identifies various kinds of social entities, some of which\ninvolve people acting in solidarity, and Walther proposes an account\nof structured attitudes in terms of empathy. In the recent literature,\nGilbert (1989, 1990) introduces new reasons for denying summative\napproaches: members of social groups are subject to norms that do not\napply merely to individuals who have matching attitudes. If a couple\nis walking together to the store, one person violates a norm if she\nsuddenly takes off in a different direction without excusing herself.\nBut this would not violate any norms if collective intentions were\nmerely summative. Gilbert argues that social groups, as opposed to\nmere collections of individuals, are formed by the members making\njoint commitments. She describes the formation of such commitments,\nand analyzes group attitudes in terms of them.\n\nBratman (1993, 2014) is more concerned with demystifying shared\nintentions by explaining how they can arise from individual attitudes.\nInstead of searching for a general analysis, he proposes sufficient\nconditions for the formation of shared intention, as applied to the\ncase of \u201cmodestly social\u201d groups. These are small,\nunstructured groups of people, in which all members participate\nknowledgably in coordination with one another. Bratman analyzes shared\nintention in terms of the common knowledge of group members, together\nwith \u201cmeshing\u201d intentions by group members to perform an\naction by way of the actions and plans of the other members. Bratman\nargues that the norms Gilbert observes can be derived from these\ninterpersonal intentions together with standard moral obligations.\n\nTuomela and Miller (1988) and Searle (1990) account for group\nintention differently. Following Sellars (1968, 1980), they propose\nthat there is an overlooked class of attitudes that individual people\npossess: in addition to \u201cI-attitudes\u201d, individuals also\nhave \u201cwe-attitudes\u201d. According to Searle, these are\ndistinct primitive mental states. For a group to collectively intend\nJ, according to Searle, is for all the members of the group to\nwe-intend J. His view is somewhat similar to a \u201csummative\u201d\nview of group attitudes, except that collective attitudes are sums of\nwe-attitudes rather than I-attitudes. Tuomela and Miller also\ndistinguish attitudes in the \u201cwe-mode\u201d from attitudes in\nthe \u201cI-mode\u201d. The most unified form of group attitude, in\ntheir view, is made up of the members having we-mode attitudes. But\nfor Tuomela and Miller, we-mode attitudes are not primitive, but are\nbuilt out of more standard attitudes. They also admit different\nspecies of group attitudes, some of which are built of I-mode\nattitudes of group members, much like Bratman does. In recent years,\npsychologists and cognitive scientists have begun to investigate\nwhether there are distinctively social attitudes (see Knoblich,\nButterfill et al. 2011, Gallotti & Frith 2013, Tomasello\n2014).\n\nIn addition to collective intentions, other philosophers have worked\non the analysis of other attitudes, such collective belief and\njudgment (Gilbert 1987, Wray 2001, Hakli 2006, List 2014).\n\nThe analysis of collective attitudes raises questions about the nature\nof group minds more generally, and whether or not they are to be\nunderstood as extensions of individual properties applied to groups. A\nnumber of theorists take a functionalist approach to group minds and\nagency. On this approach, group agents or group cognitive systems are\nunderstood to function in a similar way as individuals do, at a\ncertain level of description. A widely accepted theory of individual\nagency is that people have a modular system that we use to navigate\nthe world. We have beliefs, knowledge, form intentions, plan, reason,\nand take action. All of these components can be described in terms of\ntheir functional contributions to the system, and they integrate with\none another to perform unified functions. They compose, in other\nwords, a \u201csystem of practical activity\u201d. Group agency is\nunderstood on this model: for group agents, the same functional system\nis realized, but by groups or distributed systems rather than by\nindividuals. (See Bratman 1987, 1993, 2014; List & Pettit 2011; Theiner &\nO\u2019Connor 2010; Theiner 2014; Epstein forthcoming). List and\nPettit argue that such realizers constitute new \u201cloci of\nagency\u201d, or \u201cgroups with minds of their own\u201d.\n\nOthers challenge group minds by arguing against functional treatments\nof mind altogether. Rupert (2014), for instance, argues that having\nphenomenal states is a requirement for intentionality, but that groups\ncannot have such states (see also Schwitzgebel 2015, List\nforthcoming). Other theorists object to the typical focus of this\nliterature on small unstructured collectives of adults interacting\nwith one another. They instead work on the attitudes of complex\ngroups, corporations, and large-scale systems (Hutchins 1995, Huebner\n2013). Questions of moral agency and corporate\nresponsibility may also bear on how to analyze group agency and group\nminds (see French 1979, Tollefsen 2002, Pettit 2007, Hess 2010, List\n& Pettit 2011).\n",
