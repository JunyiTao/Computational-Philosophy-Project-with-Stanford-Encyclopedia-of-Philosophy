    "main_text": "Theodicies || A Soul-Making Theodicy\n7.1 A Soul-Making Theodicy\n\nOne very important type of theodicy, championed especially by John\nHick, involves the idea that the evils that the world contains can be\nseen to be justified if one views the world as designed by God to be an\nenvironment in which people, through their free choices, can undergo\nspiritual growth that will ultimately fit them for communion with\nGod:\n\nThe value-judgement that is implicitly being invoked here is that one\nwho has attained to goodness by meeting and eventually mastering\ntemptation, and thus by rightly making responsibly choices in concrete\nsituations, is good in a richer and more valuable sense than would be\none created ab initio in a state either of innocence or of virtue. In\nthe former case, which is that of the actual moral achievements of\nmankind, the individual\u2019s goodness has within it the strength of\ntemptations overcome, a stability based upon an accumulation of right\nchoices, and a positive and responsible character that comes from the\ninvestment of costly personal effort. (1977, 255\u20136)\n\n\nHick\u2019s basic suggestion, then, is that soul-making is a great good,\nthat God would therefore be justified in designing a world with that\npurpose in mind, that our world is very well designed in that regard,\nand thus that, if one views evil as a problem, it is because one\nmistakenly thinks that the world ought, instead, to be a hedonistic\nparadise.\n Is this theodicy satisfactory? There are a number of reasons for\nholding that it is not. First, what about the horrendous suffering\nthat people undergo, either at the hands of others\u2014as in the\nHolocaust\u2014or because of terminal illnesses such as cancer? One\nwriter\u2014Eleonore Stump\u2014has suggested that the terrible\nsuffering that many people undergo at the ends of their lives, in\ncases where it cannot be alleviated, is to be viewed as suffering that\nhas been ordained by God for the spiritual health of the individual in\nquestion (1993b, 349). But given that it does not seem to be true\nthat terrible terminal illnesses more commonly fall upon those in bad\nspiritual health than upon those of good character, let alone that\nthey fall only upon the former, this \u2018spiritual\nchemotherapy\u2019 view seems quite hopeless. More generally, there\nseems to be no reason at all why a world must contain horrendous\nsuffering if it is to provide a good environment for the development\nof character in response to challenges and temptations.\n\nSecondly, and is illustrated by the weakness of Hick\u2019s own discussion (1977, 309\u201317), a soul-making theodicy provides no justification for the existence of any animal pain, let alone for a world where\npredation is not only present but a major feature of non-human animal\nlife, and has been so for millions of years. The world could perfectly well have contained only human persons, or only human persons plus herbivores.\n\nThirdly, the soul-making theodicy also provides no account of the suffering that young, innocent children endure, either because of terrible diseases, or at the hands of adults. For here, as in the case of animals, there is no soul-making purpose that is served.\n\nFinally, if one\u2019s purpose were to create a world that would be a good\nplace for soul-making, would our earth count as a job well done?  It\nis very hard to see that it would. Some people die young, before they\nhave had any chance at all to master temptations, to respond to\nchallenges, and to develop morally. Others endure suffering so great\nthat it is virtually impossible for them to develop those moral\ntraits that involve relationships with others. Still others enjoy\nlives of ease and luxury where there is virtually nothing that\nchallenges them to undergo moral growth.\n",
