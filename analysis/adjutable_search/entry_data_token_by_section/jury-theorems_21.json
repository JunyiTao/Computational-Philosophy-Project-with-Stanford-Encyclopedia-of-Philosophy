This section defines the epistemic aggregation problem more\ngenerally\n (Section 5.1),\n and then discusses jury theorems for aggregating votes over multiple\nalternatives\n (Section 5.2),\n aggregating estimations\n (Section 5.3),\n aggregating evaluations or grades\n (Section 5.4),\n aggregating judgments over interconnected propositions\n (Section 5.5),\n and aggregating votes of voters tracking individual facts\n (Section 5.6).\n Many theorems reach the implausible infallibility conclusion; the\ncritical analysis of this conclusion\n (Section 2)\n continues to apply.\n",
