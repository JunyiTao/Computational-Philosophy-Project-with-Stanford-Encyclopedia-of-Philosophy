Idealizing to a\ncertain extent, we say that \\(A\\) is true if we possess\na construction method that, when effected, will yield a construction\nthat is correctly described by \\(A\\). According to\nBrouwer, to say that a proposition \\(A\\) is false then\nmust mean that it is impossible to effect an appropriate construction;\nnotation \\(\\neg A\\). Such an impossibility is recognized either\nimmediately (e.g., the impossibility to identify 1 unit and 2 units)\nor mediately. In the former case, one observes directly that an\nintended construction is blocked; it \u201cdoes not go through\u201d\n(Brouwer 1907: 127 [1975: 73]). In the latter case, one shows that a\nproposition \\(A\\) is contradictory by reducing \\(A\\)\nto a known falsehood, e.g., one shows that \\(A\n\\rightarrow 1=2\\) (Brouwer 1954A: 3). In practice, one defines \\(\\neg\nA := A \\rightarrow 1=2\\) (and hence \\(\\neg 1=2\\) is seen as a\nparticular case of \\(A \\rightarrow A)\\).\n\nThe notion of \u201cnegation as impossibility\u201d is known as\n\u201cstrong negation\u201d. One speaks of the \u201cweak\nnegation\u201d of \\(A\\) to express that so far no\nproof of \\(A\\) has been found. This excludes neither\nfinding a proof of \\(A\\) nor finding a proof of \\(\\neg\nA\\) later. Clearly, then, to assert the weak negation of \\(A\\)\nis not to assign a truth value besides true and false\nto it; Barzin and Errera\u2019s claim (see\n section 4.3\n below) that its treatment of negation turns Brouwer\u2019s logic\ninto a three-valued one is groundless. The distinction between weak\nand strong negation is important for the so-called \u201cweak\ncounterexamples\u201d.\n",
