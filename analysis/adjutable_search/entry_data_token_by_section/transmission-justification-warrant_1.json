    "main_text": "Epistemic Transmission\n2. Epistemic Transmission\n\nAs said, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) based on evidence \\(e\\)\ntransmits across entailment from \\(p\\) to \\(p\\)\u2019s consequence\n\\(q\\) whenever \\(q\\) is justified for \\(s\\) in virtue of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) and her knowledge of\n\\(q\\)\u2019s deducibility from \\(p\\). This initial characterization\ncan be distilled into three conditions individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for epistemic transmission:\n\n\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to\n\\(p\\)\u2019s logical consequence \\(q\\) if and only if:\n\n(C1)\n\\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\),\n(C2)\n\\(s\\) knows that \\(q\\) is deducible from \\(p\\),\n(C3)\n\\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(q\\) in virtue of\nthe satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n\n\n\nCondition\n (C3)\n is crucial for distinguishing transmission of justification\nacross (known) entailment from closure of justification\nacross (known) entailment. Saying that \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for\nbelieving \\(p\\) is closed under \\(p\\)\u2019s (known) entailment to\n\\(q\\) is saying that:\n\n\nIf \n\n(C1)\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) and \n(C2)\n \\(s\\) knows that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), then \n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{c}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(q\\).\n\n\n\nOne can coherently accept the above principle\u2014known as the\n principle of epistemic closure\u2014but\n deny a corresponding principle of epistemic transmission,\ncashed out in terms of the conditions outlined above:\n\n\nIf \n\n(C1)\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) and \n(C2)\n \\(s\\) knows that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), then \n(C3)\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(q\\) in virtue of\nthe satisfaction of (C1) and (C2).\n\n\n\nThe principle of epistemic closure just requires that when\n\\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) and knows that \\(q\\) is\ndeducible from \\(p, s\\) have justification for believing \\(q\\). In\naddition, the principle of epistemic transmission requires\nthis justification to be had in virtue of her having justification for\n\\(p\\) and knowing that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\) (for further discussion see\nTucker 2010b\n [OIR]).\n\nAnother important distinction is the one between the principle of\nepistemic transmission and a different principle of transmission\ndiscussed by Pritchard (2012a) under the label of evidential\ntransmission principle. According to it,\n\n\nIf \\(s\\) perceptually knows that \\(p\\) in virtue of evidence set\n\\(e\\), and \\(s\\) competently deduces \\(q\\) from \\(p\\) (thereby coming\nto believe that \\(q\\) while retaining her knowledge that \\(p)\\), then\n\\(s\\) knows that \\(q\\), where that knowledge is sufficiently supported\nby \\(e\\). (Pritchard 2012a: 75)\n\n\nPritchard\u2019s principle, to begin with, concerns (perceptual)\nknowledge and not propositional justification. Moreover, it deserves\nemphasis that there are inferences that apparently satisfy\nPritchard\u2019s principle but fail to satisfy the principle of\nepistemic transmission. Consider for instance the following\ntriad:\n\nZebra\n\n\\(\\rE_3\\).\n The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\\(\\rP_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised to look\nlike zebras.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pritchard, the evidence set of a normal zoo-goer standing\nbefore the zebra enclosure typically includes, above and beyond\n \\(\\rE_3\\),\n the background proposition that \n\n\\((\\rE_B)\\)\n to disguise mules like zebras would be very costly and\ntime-consuming, would bring no comparable benefit and would be\nrelatively easy to unmask.\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\) knows\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n on the basis of her evidence set, and competently deduces\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n from \\(\\rP_3\\) thereby coming to believe \\(\\rQ_3\\). Pritchard\u2019s\nevidential transmission principle apparently accommodates the\nfact that \\(s\\) thereby comes to know \\(\\rQ_3\\). For her evidence\nset\u2014because of its inclusion of\n \\(\\rE_B\\)\u2014sufficiently\n supports \\(\\rQ_3\\). But the principle of epistemic\ntransmission is not satisfied. Although \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for \\(\\rP_3\\) and \n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\nshe knows that \\(\\rP_3\\) entails \\(\\rQ_3\\), \n\n\nshe has justification for believing \\(\\rQ_3\\) in virtue of, not\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)) and (C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)),\nbut the independent\nsupport lent to it by \\(\\rE_B\\).\n\nCondition\n (C3)\n suffices to distinguish the notion of epistemic transmission from\ndifferent notions in the neighborhood. However, as it stands, it is\nstill unsuitable for the purpose to completely characterize epistemic\ntransmission. The problem is that there are cases in which it is\nintuitive that the justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to\n\\(q\\) even if (C3), strictly speaking, is not satisfied.\nThese cases can be described as situations in which only part\nof the justification that \\(s\\) has for \\(q\\) is based on her\njustification for \\(p\\) and her knowledge of the entailment from \\(p\\)\nto \\(q\\). Consider this example. Suppose you are traveling on a train\nheading to Edinburgh. At 16:00, as you enter Newcastle upon Tyne, you\nspot the train station sign. Then, at 16:05, the ticket controller\ntells you that you are not yet in Scotland. Now consider the following\nreasoning:\n\nJourney\n\n\\(\\rE_4\\).\n At 16:05 the ticket controller tells you that you are not yet in\nScotland.\n\\(\\rP_4\\).\n You are not yet in Scotland.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_4\\).\n You are not yet in Edinburgh.\n\n\n\nAs you learn\n \\(\\rE_4\\),\n given suitable background information, you get justification for\n \\(\\rP_4\\);\n moreover, to the extent to which you know that not being in Scotland\nis sufficient for not being in Edinburgh, you also acquire via\ntransmission justification for\n \\(\\rQ_4\\).\n This additional justification is transmitted irrespective of the fact\nthat you already have justification for \\(\\rQ_4\\), acquired\nby spotting the train station sign \u2018Newcastle upon Tyne\u2019.\nIf\n (C3)\n were read as requiring that the whole of the justification\navailable for a proposition \\(q\\) were had in virtue of the\nsatisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2),\n cases like these would become invisible.\n\n\nA way to deal with this complication is to amend the tripartite\nanalysis of epistemic transmission by turning\n (C3)\n into (C3\\(^{+}\\)), saying that at least part of the\njustification that \\(s\\) has for \\(q\\) has been achieved by her in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n Let us say that a justification for \\(q\\) is an additional\njustification for \\(q\\) whenever it is not a first-time\njustification for it. Condition (C3\\(^{+}\\)) can be reformulated as\nthis disjunction:\n\n(C3\\(^{+}\\))\n \\(s\\) has first-time justification for \\(q\\) in virtue\nof the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2),\n\nor\n\n\\(s\\) has an additional justification for \\(q\\) in virtue\nof the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n\n\n\nMuch of the extant literature on epistemic transmission concentrates\non examples of transmission of first-time justification. These\nexamples include\n Toadstool.\n We have seen, however, that what intuitively transmits in other cases\nis simply additional justification. Epistemologists have identified at\nleast two\u2014possibly overlapping\u2014kinds of additional\njustification (cf. Moretti & Piazza 2013).\n\nOne is what can be called independent justification because\nit appears\u2014intuitively\u2014independent of the original\njustification for \\(q\\). This notion of justification can probably be\nsharpened by appealing to counterfactual analysis. Suppose\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to\n\\(p\\)\u2019s logical consequence \\(q\\). This justification\ntransmitted to \\(q\\) is an additional independent\njustification just in case these three conditions are met: \n\n(IN1)\n\\(s\\) was already justified in believing \\(q\\) before acquiring\n\\(e\\), \n(IN2)\nas \\(s\\) acquires \\(e, s\\) is still justified in believing \\(q\\),\nand \n(IN3)\nif \\(s\\) had not been antecedently justified in believing \\(q\\),\nupon learning \\(e, s\\) would have acquired via transmission a\nfirst-time justification for believing \\(q\\). \n\n\nJourney\n instantiates transmission of justification by meeting\n (IN1),\n (IN2), and\n (IN3).\n Thus, Journey exemplifies a case of transmission of\nadditional independent justification.\n\nConsider now that justification for a proposition or belief normally\ncomes in degrees of strength. The second kind of additional\njustification can be characterized as quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. Suppose again that \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to \\(p\\)\u2019s\nconsequence \\(q\\). This justification transmitted to \\(q\\) is an\nadditional quantitatively strengthening justification just in\ncase these two conditions are satisfied:\n\n(STR1)\n \\(s\\) was already justified in believing \\(q\\) before acquiring\n\\(e\\), and \n(STR2)\n as \\(s\\) acquires \\(e\\), the strength of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for believing \\(q\\) increases. \n\n\nHere is an example from Moretti (2012). Your background information\nsays that only one ticket out of 5,000 of a fair lottery has been\nbought by a person born in 1970, and that all other tickets have been\nbought by older or younger people. Consider now this reasoning:\n\nLottery\n\n\\(\\rE_5\\).\n The lottery winner\u2019s passport certifies she was born in\n1980.\n\\(\\rP_5\\).\n The lottery\u2019s winner was born in 1980.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_5\\).\n The lottery\u2019s winner was not born in 1970.\n\n\n\nGiven its high chance,\n \\(\\rQ_5\\)\n is already justified on your background information only. It is\nintuitive that as you learn\n \\(\\rE_5\\),\n you acquire an additional quantitatively strengthening justification\nfor \\(\\rQ_5\\) via transmission. For your justification for\n \\(\\rP_5\\)\n transmitted to \\(\\rQ_5\\) is intuitively quantitatively stronger than\nyour initial justification for \\(\\rQ_5\\).\n\nIn many cases when \\(q\\) receives via transmission from \\(p\\) an\nadditional independent justification, \\(q\\) also receives a\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This is not always true\nthough. For there seem to be cases in which an additional independent\njustification transmitted from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) intuitively\nlessens an antecedent justification for \\(q\\) (cf. Wright\n2011).\n\nAn interesting question is whether it is true that as \\(q\\) gets via\ntransmission from \\(p\\) an additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification, \\(q\\) also gets an independent justification. This\nseems true in some cases\u2014for instance in\n Lottery.\n It is controversial, however, if it is the case that\nwhenever \\(q\\) gets via transmission a quantitatively\nstrengthening justification, \\(q\\) also gets an independent\njustification. Wright (2011) and Moretti & Piazza (2013) describe\ntwo examples in which a subject allegedly receives via transmission a\nquantitatively strengthening but not independent additional\njustification.\n\nTo summarize, additional justification comes in two species\nat least: independent justification and quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. This enables us to lay down three\nspecifications of the general condition\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n necessary for justification transmission, each of which represents a\ncondition necessary for the transmission of one particular type of\njustification. Let\u2019s call these specifications\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}\\)),\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ai}}\\)), and\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{aqs}}\\)).\n\n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has first time justification for \\(q\\) in virtue\nof the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n\n\n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ai}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has additional independent justification for \\(q\\)\nin virtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n \n\n\n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{aqs}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification for \\(q\\) in virtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n \n\n\nTransmission of first-time justification makes the advancement of\njustified belief through deductive reasoning possible. Yet the\nacquisition of first-time justification for \\(q\\) isn\u2019t the sole\npossible improvement of one\u2019s epistemic position relative to\n\\(q\\) that one could expect from transmission of justification.\nMoretti & Piazza (2013), for instance, describe a variety of\ndifferent ways in which s\u2019s epistemic standing toward a\nproposition can be improved upon acquiring an additional justification\nfor it via transmission.\n\nWe conclude this section with a note about transmissivity as\nresolving doubts. Let us say that \\(s\\) doubts \\(q\\)\njust in case \\(s\\) either disbelieves or withholds\nbelief about \\(q\\), namely, refrains from both believing and\ndisbelieving \\(q\\) after deciding about \\(q\\). \\(s\\)\u2019s\ndoubting \\(q\\) should be distinguished from \\(s\\)\u2019s being\nopen minded about \\(q\\) and from \\(s\\)\u2019s having\nno doxastic attitude whatsoever towards \\(q\\) (cf. Tucker\n2010a). Let us say that a deductively valid argument from \\(p\\) to\n\\(q\\) is able to resolve doubt about its conclusion just in case it is\npossible for \\(s\\) to be rationally moved from doubting \\(q\\) to\nbelieving \\(q\\) solely in virtue of grasping the argument from \\(p\\)\nto \\(q\\) and the evidence offered for \\(p\\).\n\nSome authors (e.g., Davies 1998, 2003, 2004, 2009; McLaughlin 2000;\nWright 2002, 2003, 2007) have proposed that we should conceive of an\nargument\u2019s epistemic transmissivity in a way that is very\nclosely related or even identical to the argument\u2019s ability to\nresolve doubt about its conclusion. Whereas some of these authors have\neventually conceded that epistemic transmissivity cannot be defined as\nability to resolve doubt (e.g., Wright 2011), others have attempted to\narticulate this view in full (see mainly Davies 2003, 2004, 2009).\n\nHowever, there is nowadays wide agreement in the literature that the\nproperty of being a transmissive argument doesn\u2019t\ncoincide with the one of being an argument able to resolve doubt about\nits conclusion (see for example, Beebee 2001; Coliva 2010; Markie\n2005; Pryor 2004; Bergmann 2004, 2006; White 2006; Silins 2005; Tucker\n2010a). A good reason to think so is that whereas the property of\nbeing transmissive appears to be a genuinely epistemic\nproperty of an argument, the one of resolving doubt seems to be only a\ndialectical feature of it, which varies with the audience\nwhose doubt the argument is used to address.\n",
