    "main_text": "\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Republic centers on a simple question: is it always\nbetter to be just than unjust? The puzzles in Book One prepare for\nthis question, and Glaucon and Adeimantus make it explicit at the\nbeginning of Book Two. To answer the question, Socrates takes a long\nway around, sketching an account of a good city on the grounds that a\ngood city would be just and that defining justice as a virtue of a\ncity would help to define justice as a virtue of a human being.\nSocrates is finally close to answering the question after he\ncharacterizes justice as a personal virtue at the end of Book Four,\nbut he is interrupted and challenged to defend some of the more\ncontroversial features of the good city he has sketched. In Books Five\nthrough Seven, he addresses this challenge, arguing (in effect) that\nthe just city and the just human being as he has sketched them are in\nfact good and are in principle possible. After this long digression,\nSocrates in Books Eight and Nine finally delivers three\n\u201cproofs\u201d that it is always better to be just than\nunjust. Then, because Socrates wants not only to show that it is\nalways better to be just but also to convince Glaucon and Adeimantus\nof this point, and because Socrates\u2019 proofs are opposed by the\nteachings of poets, he bolsters his case in Book Ten by indicting the\npoets\u2019 claims to represent the truth and by offering a new myth that\nis consonant with his proofs.\n\n\nAs this overview makes clear, the center of Plato\u2019s Republic\nis a contribution to ethics: a discussion of what the virtue justice \nis and why a person should be just. Yet because Socrates links his \ndiscussion of personal justice to an account of justice in the city \nand makes claims about how good and bad cities are arranged, the \nRepublic sustains reflections on political questions, as \nwell. Not that ethics and politics exhaust the concerns of the \nRepublic. The account in Books Five through Seven of how a \njust city and a just person are in principle possible is an account \nof how knowledge can rule, which includes discussion of what \nknowledge and its objects are. Moreover, the indictment of the poets \ninvolves a wide-ranging discussion of art. This article, however, \nfocuses on the ethics and politics of Plato\u2019s Republic. For \nmore on what the Republic says about knowledge and its \nobjects, see \n Plato: middle period metaphysics and epistemology,\n and for more about the discussion of the poets, see \n Plato: rhetoric and poetry.\n \n\n\nThis article attempts to provide a constructive guide to the main \nissues of ethics and politics in the Republic. Two \nassumptions shape its organization. First, it assumes that an account\nof ethics and politics in the Republic requires a \npreliminary understanding of the question Socrates is facing and the \nstrategy Socrates uses to answer the question. Second, it assumes \nthat politics in the Republic is based upon the moral \npsychology in the Republic, and thus that the former is more\nprofitably discussed after the latter. With these assumptions in \nplace, the following outline unfolds:\n",
