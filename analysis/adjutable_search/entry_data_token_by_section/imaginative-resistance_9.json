    "main_text": "Imagination || No-Imagination Theories\n3.2 No-Imagination Theories\n\nNo-imagination theories appeal neither to cognitive imagination nor to\nconative imagination in their explanations of the mechanism(s)\ninvolved in the resistance reactions. \n\nGendler (2008a, 2008b) claims that alief, which she proposes as an\ninnate propensity to automatically respond to a real or apparent\nstimulus, is what is responsible for resistance reactions, not\nimagination (for more on alief, see section 3.3 of the entry on\n imagination).\n Alief is more primitive and fundamental than cognitive or conative\nimagination. It is responsible for generating a resistance response to\nprompted imaginings due to the perceived (perhaps unconsciously\nperceived or registered) possibility of contagion. \n\nAnother explanation of imaginative resistance that locates the source\nof resistance reactions somewhere other than the imagination puts\nemotions center stage. Ronald de Sousa (2010) claims that what is\ngoing on in resistance cases is not that we are unable to make sense\nof the content of the imagined situation but that we fail to\nexperience certain emotional responses or fail to respond altogether\nto certain imagined prospects. For instance, Giselda\nengenders moral repulsion on the side of the imaginer while\nprescribing that they feel moral allegiance or approval. The\nknock-knock joke, on the other hand, fails to engender amusement while\nthe author insists that we find it hilarious.\n",
