    "main_text": "Methodology\n2. Methodology\n\nThis discussion inherits the complexities of two very intricate\nphilosophical debates (about God, and about time). Given the nature of\nthe topic, it is perhaps not unreasonable to wonder what methodology\ncan be fruitfully employed here.\n\nAs the topic is the God of Western theism, there are constraints\narising from relevant passages in Western Scripture. Much of the\ndiscussion focuses on the Judeo-Christian, especially the Christian,\ntradition. (But note that specific Christian doctrines such as the\ndoctrine of the Trinity or the Incarnation, while closely related, are\nnot the focus here; for more on these, see, e.g., (Le Poidevin 2023).) The Bible contains many\npassages calling God eternal, as well as ones that elaborate on\nGod\u2019s eternality. For example, there are passages telling us\nthat God\u2019s \u201cyears have no end\u201d (Ps. 102:27, all\nquotations are from the New Revised Standard Version) and that God\nexists \u201cfrom everlasting to everlasting\u201d (Pss. 90:2,\n103:17). God says, \u201clet there be lights in the dome of the sky\nto separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for\nseasons and for days and years\u201d (Gen. 1:14), and \u201cI am the\nfirst and I am the last\u201d (Isa. 44:6). Moreover, we are told that\nGod promised us eternal life \u201cbefore the ages began\u201d\n(Titus 1:2), and that \u201cHe himself is before all things\u201d\n(Col. 1:17). These passages require interpretation, and that\u2019s\nwhere the philosophical work begins (see, e.g., Leftow 2005 for a\nformulation of constraints based on these passages).\n\nOne broad methodological choice concerns whether or not to let\none\u2019s theological commitments determine one\u2019s views about\nthe metaphysics, or even the physics of time. A salient alternative\nwould be to do the opposite, for example by taking as one\u2019s\nstarting point the metaphysical view of time suggested by our best\nphysical theories and then drawing out any theological implications. A\nthird approach might involve giving equal weight to both poles and\nseeking to come to a coherent and adequate conception of both time and\nGod as part of the same endeavor. There probably exist a variety of\nstances across the philosophical and theological landscapes (for\nexplicit reflection on related methodological questions see, e.g.,\nMurray & Rea 2008: 47; Mullins 2016: Ch. 1).\n",
