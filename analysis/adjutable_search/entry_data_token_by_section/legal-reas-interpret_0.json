What Do Legal Theorists Mean By \u2018Legal Reasoning\u2019?\n\n\nThis may seem like an easy question, for surely legal reasoning is\nsimply reasoning about the law, or about how judges should decide\ncases. On closer inspection, however, our ease may evaporate, for both\nof these formulations are ambiguous, at least according to some ways of\nthinking about the law.\u00a0\u00a0Some legal theorists regard the questions,\n\u2018what is the law?\u2019, and \u2018how should judges decide\ncases?\u2019 as distinct questions with distinct answers (see e.g.\nHart 1994; Kelsen 1967; Raz 1979 & 1994). That is to say, their\naccounts of law and their accounts of adjudication are not one and the\nsame, and they contend that in settling disputes which come before\nthem, the remit of judges is wider than merely trying to establish what\nthe law is as regards the issues in the case at hand. In adjudication,\nsuch theorists claim, extra-legal considerations can come into play,\nand judges may have discretion to modify existing law or to fill in\ngaps where existing law is indeterminate. This being so, for some legal\ntheorists, the first formulation above, that legal reasoning is\nreasoning about the law, is ambiguous between: (a) reasoning to\nestablish the content of the law as it presently exists, and (b)\nreasoning from that content to the decision which a court should reach\nin a case which comes before it. \n\n\nMoreover, the second formulation of the ambit of legal reasoning\ngiven above, i.e. that legal reasoning is about how judges should\ndecide cases, is also ambiguous on some approaches to legal theory.\nThis is because the answer to the question, \u201chow should a court\ndecide a case, reasoning from the existing law applicable to it?\u201d\n(i.e. legal reasoning in the sense given in (b) above) and the answer\nto the question, \u201chow should a court decide a case, all things\nconsidered?\u201d, may sometimes come apart. A particular instance\nmight be the kind of situation which could arise for a judge in a\n\u2018wicked\u2019 legal system where the law on some issue is so\nmorally odious that, all things considered, the judge should not decide\nthe case according to the law at all, but rather should refuse to apply\nthe law (see Hart 1958; Hart 1994, chapter 9, section 3; Raz 1994,\nessay 14. This possibility is also noted by Dworkin 1986, chapter 3,\n101\u2013108, in discussing whether the Nazis had law).\n\n\nThere are thus three things (at least, there may be others) which\nlegal theorists could mean by legal reasoning: (a) reasoning to\nestablish the existing content of the law on a given issue, (b)\nreasoning from the existing content of the law to the decision which a\ncourt should reach in a case involving that issue which comes before\nit, and (c) reasoning about the decision which a court should reach in\na case, all things considered.\n\n\nIt should be noted that some legal theorists, most notably for\npresent purposes Ronald Dworkin, do not carve up the questions and\nissues on this topic in the way outlined above. For Dworkin, when\njudges decide a case according to law, they do no more than ascertain\nthe content of the law and apply it to the facts of the case. In other\nwords, judges never resort to extra-legal considerations in deciding\ncases according to law: all the considerations which they are entitled\nto take into account are part of the law. This means that, according to\nDworkin, when judges reason about the law in sense (b), what they are\ndoing amounts to no more nor less than reasoning about the law in sense\n(a), i.e. reasoning to establish the content of the law (see Dworkin\n1977 & 1986).\n\n\nThis entry is concerned with legal reasoning in senses (a) and (b),\nand with sense (b) in particular. It should be noted that the\ndiscussion does not directly address the different accounts of the\nnature and limits of law which are revealed by those varying views\nmentioned above regarding what it is that judges do when they reason\nabout the law in sense (b). Where such differences have a bearing upon\nissues pertaining to the role of interpretation and coherence in legal\nreasoning, they will be mentioned in the text. For further discussion\nof the nature and limits of law, see various entries under nature\nof law in this volume.\n",
