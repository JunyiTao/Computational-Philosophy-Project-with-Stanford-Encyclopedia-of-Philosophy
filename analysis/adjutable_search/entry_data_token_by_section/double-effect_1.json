    "main_text": "Applications\n2. Applications\n\nMany morally reflective people have been persuaded that something\nalong the lines of double effect must be correct. No doubt this is\nbecause at least some of the examples cited as illustrations of DE\nhave considerable intuitive appeal.\n\nTerror bomber vs Tactical bomber: The terror\nbomber aims to bring about civilian deaths in order to weaken the\nresolve of the enemy: when his bombs kill civilians this is a\nconsequence that he intends. The tactical bomber aims at military\ntargets while foreseeing that bombing such targets will cause civilian\ndeaths. When his bombs kill civilians this is a foreseen but\nunintended consequence of his actions. Even if it is equally certain\nthat the two bombers will cause the same number of civilian deaths,\nterror bombing is impermissible while tactical bombing is\npermissible.\n\nEuthanasia vs Pain relief that hastens death:\nA doctor who intends to hasten the death of a terminally ill\npatient by injecting a large dose of morphine would act impermissibly\nbecause he intends to bring about the patient\u2019s death. However,\na doctor who intended to relieve the patient\u2019s pain with that\nsame dose and merely foresaw the hastening of the patient\u2019s\ndeath would act permissibly. (The mistaken assumption that the use of\nopioid drugs for pain relief tends to hasten death is discussed below\nin section 5.1.)\n\nAbortion vs Hysterectomy: A doctor who\nbelieved that abortion was wrong, even in order to save the\nmother\u2019s life, might nevertheless consistently believe that it\nwould be permissible to perform a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman\nwith cancer. In carrying out the hysterectomy, the doctor would aim to\nsave the woman\u2019s life while merely foreseeing the death of the\nfetus. Performing an abortion, by contrast, would involve intending to\nkill the fetus as a means to saving the mother.\n\nPre-emptive Killing vs Active Self-defense:\nTo kill a person whom you know to be plotting to kill you\nwould be impermissible because it would be a case of intentional\nkilling; however, to strike in self-defense against an aggressor is\npermissible, even if one foresees that the blow by which one defends\noneself will be fatal.\n\nSuicide vs Heroic Shielding: Sacrificing\none\u2019s own life in order to save the lives of others can be\ndistinguished from suicide by characterizing the agent\u2019s\nintention: a soldier who throws himself on a live grenade intends to\nshield others from its blast and merely foresees his own death; by\ncontrast, a person who commits suicide intends to bring his or her own\nlife to an end.\n\nThe Trolley Problems, Pushing a Bystander onto a Track to\nstop the trolley vs Diverting a Trolley onto a track with one person\naway from a track with five: You are a bystander\nstanding near a switch watching a runaway trolley barrel down a track\non which five people who cannot escape are positioned. Pushing another\nbystander onto the track to stop the trolley would be wrong, many\nbelieve. However, many believe that it would be permissible to turn a\nswitch and divert the trolley onto a different track on which one\nperson who cannot escape is positioned (examples from Thomson, 1985,\nbased on examples in Foot 1967).\n",
