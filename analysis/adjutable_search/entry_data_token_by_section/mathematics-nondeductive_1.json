    "main_text": "Introduction || Discovery versus Justification\n1.1 Discovery versus Justification\n\nThe broad claim that there are some non-deductive aspects of\nmathematical activity seems relatively uncontroversial. For\nthis merely amounts to the claim that not everything that\nmathematicians do when they do mathematics consists of deriving\nstatements from other statements. As James Franklin puts it:\n\nMathematics cannot consist just of conjectures, refutations and\nproofs. Anyone can generate conjectures, but which ones are worth\ninvestigating? \u2026 Which might be capable of proof by a method in\nthe mathematician\u2019s repertoire? \u2026 Which are unlikely to\nyield answer until after the next review of tenure? The mathematician\nmust answer these questions to allocate his time and effort. (Franklin\n1987, 2)\n\n\nOne way to narrow the general claim so as to make it more substantive\nis make use of the familiar (though not entirely unproblematic)\ndistinction between \u2018context of discovery\u2019 and\n\u2018context of justification\u2019. On the one hand, this\ndistinction may allow the traditional deductivist view to be\nmaintained in the face of Lakatos\u2019s critique, by arguing that\nwhat Lakatos is pointing to concerns the context of discovery in\nmathematics. Within the context of justification, derivation of\nresults from axioms may still be the correct and complete story. Some\nof the reactions of mathematicians to Lakatos\u2019s views have this\ncharacter, for example the following remark by Morris Kline in a\nletter written to Lakatos:\n\nI do believe we need much more literature emphasizing the discovery\nside of mathematics. All the emphasis, as you know and as you imply,\nis on the deductive structure of mathematics and the impression being\ngiven to students is that one deduces new conclusions from old\n ones.[1]\n\n\nIt is also possible to find passages along similar lines in the work\nof P\u00f3lya, who was a major influence on Lakatos:\n\nStudying the methods of solving problems, we perceive another\nface of mathematics. Yes, mathematics has two faces; it is the\nrigorous science of Euclid, but it is also something else. Mathematics\npresented in the Euclidean way appears as a systematic, deductive\nscience, but mathematics in the making appears an\nexperimental, inductive science. (P\u00f3lya 1945, vii)\n[italics in original]\n\n\nConversely, in order to pose a genuine challenge to the familiar\ndeductivist position, the counterclaim needs to be that non-deductive\nmethods play a role in the justification of mathematical\nresults (Paseau 2015). It will therefore be primarily justificatory\ncontexts which will be focused on in the remainder of this\n survey.[2]\n",
