    "main_text": "Alternative Tests || The Turing Test is Too Hard\n5.1 The Turing Test is Too Hard\n\nSome people have claimed that The Turing Test doesn\u2019t set an\nappropriate goal for current research in AI because we are plainly so\nfar away from attaining this goal. Amongst these people there are some\nwho have gone on to offer reasons for thinking that it is doubtful\nthat we shall ever be able to create a machine that can pass The\nTuring Test\u2014or, at any rate, that it is doubtful that we shall\nbe able to do this at any time in the foreseeable future. Perhaps the\nmost interesting arguments of this kind are due to French (1990); at\nany rate, these are the arguments that we shall go on to consider.\n(Cullen (2009) sets out similar considerations.)\n\nAccording to French, The Turing Test is \u201cvirtually\nuseless\u201d as a real test of intelligence, because nothing without\na \u201chuman subcognitive substrate\u201d could pass the test, and\nyet the development of an artificial \u201chuman cognitive\nsubstrate\u201d is almost impossibly difficult. At the very least,\nthere are straightforward sets of questions that reveal\n\u201clow-level cognitive structure\u201d and that\u2014in\nFrench\u2019s view\u2014are almost certain to be successful in\nseparating human beings from machines.\n\nFirst, if interrogators are allowed to draw on the results of research\ninto, say, associative priming, then there is data that will\nvery plausibly separate human beings from machines. For example, there\nis research that shows that, if humans are presented with series of\nstrings of letters, they require less time to recognize that a string\nis a word (in a language that they speak) if it is preceded by a\nrelated word (in the language that they speak), rather than by an\nunrelated word (in the language that they speak) or a string of\nletters that is not a word (in the language that they speak). Provided\nthat the interrogator has accurate data about average recognition\ntimes for subjects who speak the language in question, the\ninterrogator can distinguish between the machine and the human simply\nby looking at recognition times for appropriate series of strings of\nletters. Or so says French. It isn\u2019t clear to us that this is\nright. After all, the design of The Turing Test makes it hard to see\nhow the interrogator will get reliable information about response\ntimes to series of strings of symbols. The point of putting the\ncomputer in a separate room and requiring communication by teletype\nwas precisely to rule out certain irrelevant ways of identifying the\ncomputer. If these requirements don\u2019t already rule out\nidentification of the computer by the application of tests of\nassociative priming, then the requirements can surely be altered to\nbring it about that this is the case. (Perhaps it is also worth noting\nthat administration of the kind of test that French imagines is not\nordinary conversation; nor is it something that one would expect that\nany but a few expert interrogators would happen upon. So, even if the\ncircumstances of The Turing Test do not rule out the kind of procedure\nthat French here envisages, it is not clear that The Turing Test will\nbe impossibly hard for machines to pass.)\n\nSecond, at a slightly higher cognitive level, there are certain kinds\nof \u201cratings games\u201d that French supposes will be very\nreliable discriminators between humans and machines. For instance, the\n\u201cNeologism Ratings Game\u201d\u2014which asks participants to\nrank made-up words on their appropriateness as names for given kinds\nof entities\u2014and the \u201cCategory Rating\nGame\u201d\u2014which asks participants to rate things of one\ncategory as things of another category\u2014are both, according to\nFrench, likely to prove highly reliable in discriminating between\nhumans and machines. For, in the first case, the ratings that humans\nmake depend upon large numbers of culturally acquired associations\n(which it would be well-nigh impossible to identify and describe, and\nhence which it would (arguably) be well-nigh impossible to program\ninto a computer). And, in the second case, the ratings that people\nactually make are highly dependent upon particular social and cultural\nsettings (and upon the particular ways in which human life is\nexperienced). To take French\u2019s examples, there would be\nwidespread agreement amongst competent English speakers in the\ntechnologically developed Western world that \u201cFlugblogs\u201d\nis not an appropriate name for a breakfast cereal, while\n\u201cFlugly\u201d is an appropriate name for a child\u2019s teddy\nbear. And there would also be widespread agreement amongst competent\nspeakers of English in the developed world that pens rate higher as\nweapons than grand pianos rate as wheelbarrows. Again, there are\nquestions that can be raised about French\u2019s argument here. It is\nnot clear to us that the data upon which the ratings games rely is as\nreliable as French would have us suppose. (At least one of us thinks\nthat \u201cFlugly\u201d would be an entirely inappropriate name for\na child\u2019s teddy bear, a response that is due to the similarity\nbetween the made-up word \u201cFlugly\u201d and the word\n\u201cFugly,\u201d that had some currency in the primarily\nundergraduate University college that we both attended. At least one\nof us also thinks that young children would very likely be delighted\nto eat a cereal called \u201cFlugblogs,\u201d and that a good answer\nto the question about ratings pens and grand pianos is that it all\ndepends upon the pens and grand pianos in question. What if the grand\npiano has wheels? What if the opponent has a sword or a sub-machine\ngun? It isn\u2019t obvious that a refusal to play this kind of\nratings game would necessarily be a give-away that one is a machine.)\nMoreover, even if the data is reliable, it is not obvious that any but\na select group of interrogators will hit upon this kind of strategy\nfor trying to unmask the machine; nor is it obvious that it is\nimpossibly hard to build a machine that is able to perform in the way\nin which typical humans do on these kinds of tests. In particular,\nif\u2014as Turing assumes\u2014it is possible to make learning\nmachines that can be \u201ctrained up\u201d to learn how to do\nvarious kinds of tasks, then it is quite unclear why these machines\ncouldn\u2019t acquire just the same kinds of \u201csubcognitive\ncompetencies\u201d that human children acquire when they are\n\u201ctrained up\u201d in the use of language.\n\nThere are other reasons that have been given for thinking that The\nTuring Test is too hard (and, for this reason, inappropriate in\nsetting goals for current research into artificial intelligence). In\ngeneral, the idea is that there may well be features of human\ncognition that are particularly hard to simulate, but that are not in\nany sense essential for intelligence (or thought, or possession of a\nmind). The problem here is not merely that The Turing Test really does\ntest for human intelligence; rather, the problem here is the\nfact\u2014if indeed it is a fact\u2014that there are quite\ninessential features of human intelligence that are extraordinarily\ndifficult to replicate in a machine. If this complaint is\njustified\u2014if, indeed, there are features of human intelligence\nthat are extraordinarily difficult to replicate in machines,\nand that could and would be reliably used to unmask machines\nin runs of The Turing Test\u2014then there is reason to worry about\nthe idea that The Turing Test sets an appropriate direction for\nresearch in artificial intelligence. However, as our discussion of\nFrench shows, there may be reason for caution in supposing that the\nkinds of considerations discussed in the present section show that we\nare already in a position to say that The Turing Test does indeed set\ninappropriate goals for research in artificial intelligence.\n",
