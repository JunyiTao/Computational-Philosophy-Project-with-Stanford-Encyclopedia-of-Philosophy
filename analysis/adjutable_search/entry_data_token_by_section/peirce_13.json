    "main_text": "Peirce\u2019s Reduction Thesis\n14. Peirce\u2019s Reduction Thesis\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s so-called \u201cReduction Thesis\u201d is the thesis that\nall relations, relations of arbitrary adicity, may be constructed from\ntriadic relations alone, whereas monadic and dyadic relations alone\nare not sufficient to allow the construction of even a single\n\u201cnon-degenerate\u201d (that is: non-Cartesian-factorable)\ntriadic relation. Although the germ of his argument for the Reduction\nThesis lay in his 1873 [1870] paper \u201cDescription of a Notation for the\nLogic of Relatives,\u201d the Thesis was for over a century doubted\nby many, especially after the publication of a proof by Willard Van\nOrman Quine that all relations could be constructed exclusively from\ndyadic ones. As it turns out, both Peirce and Quine were correct: the\nissue entirely depends on exactly what constructive resources are to\nbe allowed to be used in building relations out of other\nrelations. (Obviously, the more extensive and powerful are the\nconstructive resources, the more likely it is that all relations can\nbe constructed from dyadic ones alone by using them.) An exact\nexposition and proof of Peirce\u2019s Reduction Thesis was finally\naccomplished in 1988 (Burch 1991), and it makes clear that Peirce\u2019s\nconstructive resources are to be understood to include only negation,\na generalization of de Morgan\u2019s relative product operation, and the\nuse of a particular triadic relation that Peirce called \u201cthe\nteridentity relation\u201d and that we might today write as x = y\n= z.\n\n\nPeirce felt that the teridentity relation was in some way more\nprimitive logically and thus more fundamental than the usual dyadic\nidentity relation x = y, which he derived from two instances\nof the triadic identity relation by two applications of the relative\nproduct operation of de Morgan. Peirce also felt that de Morgan\u2019s\nrelative product operation was logically a more primitive and\nfundamental operation than, say, the Boolean product or the Boolean\nsum. The full philosophical import of his Reduction Thesis, and the\nphilosophical importance of his triadism insofar as this triadism\nrests on his Reduction Thesis, cannot be ascertained without a prior\nunderstanding of his non-typical theory of identity and his special\nview of the fundamental nature of the relative product operation.\n15. Contemporary Practical Applications of Peirce\u2019s Ideas\n\n\nCurrently, considerable interest is being taken in Peirce\u2019s ideas by\nresearchers wholly outside the arena of academic philosophy. The\ninterest comes from industry, business, technology, intelligence\norganizations, and the military; and it has resulted in the existence\nof a substantial number of agencies, institutes, businesses, and\nlaboratories in which ongoing research into and development of\nPeircean concepts are being vigorously undertaken.\n\n\nThis interest arose, originally, in two ways. First, some thirty years\nago in the former Soviet Union interest in Peirce and Karl Popper had\nled logicians and computer scientists like Victor Konstantinovich Finn\nand Dmitri Pospelov to try to find ways in which computer programs\ncould generate Peircean hypotheses (Popperian\n\u201cconjectures\u201d) in \u201csemeiotic\u201d contexts\n(non-numerical or qualitative contexts). Under the guide in particular\nof Finn\u2019s intelligent systems laboratory in VINITI-RAN (the\nAll-Russian Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences), elaborate techniques for automatic\ngeneration of hypotheses were found and were extensively utilized for\nmany practical purposes. Finn called his approach to hypothesis\ngeneration the \u201cJSM Method of Automatic Hypothesis\nGeneration\u201d (so named for similarities to John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nmethods for identifying causes).  Among the purposes for which the JSM\nMethod has proved fruitful are sociological prediction,\npharmacological discovery, and the analysis of processes of industrial\nproduction. Interest in Finn\u2019s work, and through it in the practical\napplication of Peirce\u2019s philosophy, has spread to France, Germany,\nDenmark, Finland, and ultimately the United States.\n\n\nSecond, as the limits of expert systems and production rule\nprogramming in the area of artificial intelligence became increasingly\nclear to computer scientists, they began to search for methods beyond\nthose that depended merely on imitating experts. One promising line of\nresearch has been to automate phases of (Peirce\u2019s concept of) the\nscientific method, complete with techniques for hypothesis generation\nand making assessments of the costs and benefits of exploring\nhypotheses. In some areas of research added impetus has been provided\nby the similarity of Peircean techniques to techniques that have\nalready proven useful. For example, in the field of automated\nmulti-track radar, the similarity of Peircean scientific method to the\nso-called \u201cKalman filter\u201d has been noted by many systems\nanalysts. Again, those interested in military command-and-control\noften note the similarity of Peircean scientific method to the classic\nOODA loop (\u201cobserve, orient, decide, act\u201d) of\ncommand-and-control-theory. The aerospace industry, especially in\nFrance and the United States, is currently investigating Peircean\nideas in connection with avionics systems that monitor aircraft\n\u201chealth.\u201d\n\n\nAlmost simultaneously with Finn\u2019s development of Automatic Generation\nof Hypotheses, German mathematicians Rudolf Wille and Bernhardt Ganter\nwere developing an aspect of Galois Theory and lattice theory (the\nlatter being, as was said, Peirce\u2019s invention) that came to be known\nas \u201cFormal Concept Analysis.\u201d Interestingly enough, even though the\ntwo groups of researchers initially were working completely\nindependently of each other, the mathematical apparatus of Finn\u2019s\nAutomatic Generation of Hypotheses is at its core the very same\napparatus as that of Wille\u2019s and Ganter\u2019s Formal Concept Analysis.\nFor obvious reasons, then, there has now grown up an extensive\ncooperation between the German researchers and the Russian\nresearchers, principally through the writings and intermediary work of\nSergei Kuznetsov, who has been working both with the German group and\nwith the Russian group.\n\n\nThe heart of both sets of ideas is the notion of clustering items by\nsimilarity. The algorithms for clustering into formal concepts are the\nsame as the algorithms for preliminary groupings by similarity for the\npurpose of automatically generating hypotheses. As it turns out, and\nas Kuznetsov has shown, these algorithms are equivalent in their\neffect to algorithms for finding the maximal complete subgraphs of\narbitrary graphs. This fact has proved extremely useful in recent\nyears, since the latter algorithms are the core of what has come to be\nknown as \u201cSocial Network Analysis.\u201d And Social Network Analysis has\nbecome a major intellectual tool in the world\u2019s battles against\ncriminal organizations and terrorist networks. So all three sets of\nideas have become matters of crucial practical importance and even\nurgency in contemporary affairs.\n\n\nSuch practical applications of Peircean ideas may seem surprising to\nmany philosophers whose minds are rooted strictly in the academic\nworld. The applications, however, most certainly would not have\nsurprised Peirce in the least. Indeed, given his lifelong ideas and\ngoals as a scientist-philosopher, he probably would have found the\ncurrent practical importance of his ideas entirely to be expected.\n16. Significant Students of Peirce\n\n\nDuring the time of Peirce\u2019s teaching logic at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, that is: during the years from 1879 through 1884, Peirce\nhad a number of students in logic who then went on to establish\nsignificant reputations in their own right. Often mentioned in this\nconnection are John Dewey, Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd-Franklin,\nOscar Howard Mitchell, Benjamin I. Gilman, Fabian Franklin, and \nThorstein Veblen. Here we provide brief descriptions of\nthree of these students, Dewey, Ladd-Franklin, and Mitchell. Of\nnecessity the accounts given here of the work of these students will\nbe extremely brief. It is obvious that full-length accounts of each of\nthem can be given, and in the case of one of them, John Dewey,\nfull-length accounts have, indeed, often been given.\n\n\nWithout a doubt, the best known of all Peirce\u2019s students, even including \nThorstein Veblen, is John Dewey (1859\u20131952). \nDewey attended Peirce\u2019s logic class at John\u2019s\nHopkins during the years 1882 through 1883. Along with Peirce, Dewey\nunderstood the subject of logic in an extremely broad way, so that the\nsubject in his mind, as well as in Peirce\u2019s mind, comprised the entire\ntopic of the methodology of the exact sciences. It is not surprising,\nthen, that the structure of logic in Dewey\u2019s own works in logic,\nviz. most notably in his book Logic: the Theory of Inquiry\n(1938), is a close approximation of the structure of the scientific\nmethod as Peirce understands it. Recall that for Peirce inquiry begins\nwith an anomalous situation, in which a particular puzzle or set of\npuzzles is elicited from an indeterminate background. Then, by an\nongoing, and in fact ultimately endless, process, hypotheses are\nformulated (abduction) and tested (deduction and induction). so that\nat each iteration of the methodological \u201cloop,\u201d indeterminacy as to\nthe original anomalous situation is successively, though never\ntotally, eliminated. Dewey\u2019s own account of inquiry, especially\ninsofar as Dewey considers it to be the successive elimination of\nindeterminacy, is remarkably akin to Peirce\u2019s account of scientific\nmethodology in action. Of course there are differences. Dewey often\nwrites as though at each stage of development of the method of logic\n(of science) the next stage is more or less already specified; for\nexample, at any stage of indeterminacy, Dewey writes as if the\nrelevant hypothesis or hypotheses to test at the next stage are more\nor less already determined. By contrast, Peirce (although he sometimes\nspeaks this way) more often emphasizes the creative and non-determined\naspect of eliciting/developing hypotheses. Nevertheless, even despite\nthe differences in emphasis from Peirce to Dewey, the similarities\nbetween their positions are unmistakeable.\n\n\nUnlike Dewey, both Christine Ladd and Oscar Howard Mitchell\nconcentrated on formal deductive logic, i.e. mathematical logic,\nrather than on the informal methodology of the sciences. Also unlike\nDewey, Ladd and Mitchell both published articles in the 1883\nvolume Studies in Logic, which was edited by Peirce. Again,\nin his own \u201cPreface\u201d to this volume Peirce singles out\nboth Ladd and Mitchell for commentary and overt praise\n(p. v). To these two students of Peirce we now turn.\n\n\nChristine Ladd, born December 1, 1847, was later (from her marriage to\nFabian Franklin in 1882) known as Christine Ladd-Franklin. Although\nshe is almost unknown today, she was very well-known and\nhighly-regarded as a mathematician, logician, and psychologist from\nthe 1870s until her death on March 5, 1930 at the age of 82. Her\nearliest published work was in mathematics, in the Educational\nTimes of England. Here it attracted the attention of the great\nmathematician J. J. Sylvester, who also published in the \nEducational Times and who in 1876 assumed the position of the\nfirst professor of mathematics at the new Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. (It was Sylvester who hired Peirce in 1879.) On the\nstrength of her already-published work, as known by Sylvester, Ladd\napplied to Johns Hopkins in 1888 to become a graduate student in\nmathematics.  Although, because she was a woman, she could not become\na regular graduate student at Johns Hopkins, still at the ardent and\ninsistent urgings of Sylvester, she was admitted as a special-status\nstudent, and she was even awarded a fellowship to study\nmathematics. She held this fellowship from 1879 until 1882, when she\ncompleted all the requirements for the Ph.D. degree. It was during\nthis period that she became attracted to mathematical logic, and to\nthe teachings on logic of Peirce, with whom she studied\ncarefully. Because of her gender, her status as a student of\nmathematics was recorded only in notes rather than on the usual\nstudent lists. For the same reason, she could not actually be given\nthe Ph.D. degree in 1882, although she was ultimately (but not until\n1926), awarded the Ph.D. degree in mathematics. (Meanwhile, Vassar\nCollege awarded her an LL.D. degree in 1887.) On August 24, 1882, upon\nthe completion of her mathematics fellowship, she married a member of\nthe Johns Hopkins department of mathematics and a fellow-student of\nPeirce\u2019s, Fabian Franklin (b. 1853, d. 1939). Both she and Fabian\nFranklin seem to have stayed closely connected to Peirce until his\ndeath in 1914.\n\n\nAs can be gathered from the foregoing, it was studying with Peirce\nthat focussed Ladd\u2019s attention from mathematics in general to\nmathematical logic (also called symbolic logic) in particular.  Ladd\u2019s\nbest-known, and most-celebrated work was her paper \u201cOn the Algebra of\nLogic,\u201d published in Studies in Logic by the members of the Johns\nHopkins University (C. S. Peirce, editor), Little, Brown, 1883,\npp. 17\u201371. In it, she is (or at least was once) widely regarded\nas having achieved for the first time in history a completely general\nand unified account of the Aristotelian syllogism, including a general\naccount of the differences between valid and invalid\nsyllogisms. (Josiah Royce, for example, held this view of\nLadd-Franklin\u2019s work in logic.) It is thus worth looking in some\ndetail at how she achieves this result through the algebraizing of the\nsyllogism, but here such detail will not be entered into. Basically,\nhowever, we can say that her basic idea is to associate with each\npossible syllogism a certain \u201ctriad\u201d. The syllogism is\nvalid if and only if the \u201ctriad\u201d is an\n\u201cantilogism,\u201d that is to say, is an inconsistent\n\u201ctriad\u201d. Ladd-Franklin wrote on the antilogism as late as\n1928 in volume 37 of Mind, pp. 532\u2013534. Whether or not\nher work is really the first work to unify the theory of the\nsyllogism, and whether or not she ultimately merits the exalted status\nas a logician that Royce assigns to her must remain a task for future\nexploration to determine.\n\n\nIn addition to her major work on the syllogism, equivalently on the\nnotion of the antilogism, Ladd-Franklin as well wrote some of the\nentries in the three-volume work of James Mark Baldwin\n(1861\u20131934), Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology,\n1901\u20131905, for example the entries \u201csyllogism,\u201d\n\u201csymbolic logic,\u201d and \u201calgebra of logic.\u201d In\nfact she was an associate editor of Baldwin\u2019s Dictionary. She\nalso wrote at least one related paper in the Journal of\nPhilosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method, later named simply\nthe Journal of Philosophy. Her specialty in psychology\nwas the theory of vision, and she early espoused the theory that all\ncolor vision both developed historically and was based on three\nprimary colors, hence three distinct processes of chemical\nreaction. Her writings on the psychology of vision continued to pour\nfirth voluminously, and these continued from the early 1890s through\nat least 1926, when she published a paper on the mysterious visual\nphenomenon known as \u201cblue arcs\u201d in the Proceedings of\nthe National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\nPeirce praised O. H. Mitchell as being his very best student in\nlogic. Mitchell was trained as a mathematician even befoe coming to\nJohns Hopkins, and he was especially noted by all those who knew him\nas being extraordinarily meticulous and attentive to detail. He was so\nattentive to exactitude that he was even noted for slowness and\nponderousness in speech. But what was there in Mitchell\u2019s 1883 paper\nthat stimulated Peirce\u2019s high praise? It seems to be closely\nconnected, perhaps identical, with what Peirce praises Mitchell for\naccomplishing in Peirce\u2019s entry in Baldwin\u2019s Dictionary of\nPhilosophy and Psychology, particularly in his article there for\nthe word \u201cdimension.\u201d In the article Peirce credits\nMitchell with having introduced \u201cthe concept of a\nmultidimensional logical universe\u201d into exact logic, and Peirce\nclaims that it is one of the \u201cfecund contributions\u201d that\nMitchell made to exact logic. There seem to be two components to the\nidea of a multidimensional logical universe. The first one is simply\nthe idea of multiple quantification in connection with polyadic\npredicates, so that (in modern terminology) we can have propositions\nwith quantifiers occurring within the scope of other quantifiers. That\nMitchell employs a formalism suggestive of this idea is undeniable,\nbut whether he successfully distinguishes (for all x)(there\nexists a y) from (there exists a y)(for\nall x) is very much less than obvious. Moreover, that\nMitchell was the very first logician to have conceived of multiple\nquantification and polyadic predicates seems a bit dubious, especially\nsince by 1870 Peirce himself was already making use of notions for\nwhich multiple quantification and polyadic predicates are\ninvolved. The second component of the idea of a multidimensional\nlogical universe is (again, using modern terminology) the idea that\nthe universe of discourse relevant to one variable might not be the\nsame as the universe of discourse relevant to another\nvariable. Moreover, since the universe of discourse relevant to one\nvariable might be all the times there are, all the places there are,\nall possible situations, or even all possible worlds, it is not\ndifficult (though it is perhaps a bit far-fetched) to connect\nMitchell\u2019s idea of a multidimensional logical universe to the idea of\ntense logic or even modal logic. Whether a careful study of Mitchell\u2019s\nlogical contribution really supports such a reading of Mitchell\u2019s\ncontributions to logic is not as yet clearly determined.\n\n\nClearly, close study of the logical accomplishments of Peirce\u2019s\nnotable students is in order.",
