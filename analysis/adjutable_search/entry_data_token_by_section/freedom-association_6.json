    "main_text": "The Right to Exclude || Collective Associations\n3.2 Collective Associations\n\nThe importance of exclusion goes beyond the intimate settings of the\nfamily and friendships. It is also an integral part of\ncollective associations. For a devotional community,\nrecreational club, business club, union, or even nation to be what it\nis and to represent particular values, beliefs, or interests, it must\nbe able to determine, at least broadly, the criteria by which members\nare selected. This fact has limited states\u2019 rights to interfere\nwith certain groups\u2019 decisions about membership (Gutmann 1998a:\n6). However, the purposes of an association are open to reasonable\ndisagreement, and this often necessitates judicial interpretation and\ndecision (see Roberts v. United States Jaycees 468 U.S. 609\n(1984); Dale v. Boy Scouts of America 530 U.S. 640 (2000);\nJohnson 2001: 1641ff; Linder 1984).\n\nOne approach is simply to collapse all distinctions among different\ntypes of collective associations: associations are associations\nregardless of whether they are primarily expressive, commercial, or\ncreedal, and they should enjoy an absolute right over whom to admit,\nfor whatever reason they decide (Epstein 2008: 155). On this view, a\nnation, sports club, church, or business should devise its own rules\non who is in and who is out (Lomasky 2008: 184\u2013186). One\nargument for such a strong right is that only near or absolute freedom\nto exclude people adequately honors the great, inherent value of free\nassociation as something integral to the lives of free human beings\n(Kateb 1998: 37).\n\nBut, there are dangers in thinking that the right to exclude remains\nthe same, or even looks similar, across all forms of collective\nassociation. Exile from a nation differs radically from exclusion from\na sports club, which in turn differs markedly from ex-communication\nfrom a devotional community. A second approach interprets the scope\nand value of the right to exclude according to the primary goods and\nfunctions served by the relevant kind of association.\n\nExpressive associations are distinct for several reasons.\nFirst, they are intertwined with other basic rights of expression such\nas freedom of speech and freedom of religion (UDHR Articles\n18\u201319). A creed\u2019s right to exclude people, sometimes\ncashed out in terms of shunning, where excommunication involves being\nexcluded from familial associations as well (Greenawalt 1998: 142) is\noften justified in the name of worshipful or spiritual identity (i.e.,\nthe right of the Jews to be \u201cseparate\u201d or view themselves\nas \u201cchosen\u201d, the right of the Catholic Church to refuse to\nappoint women as bishops) as well as the secondary functions of a\ncreed to promote common identity, enhance internal harmony, expand the\nflock, raise funds, and gain further insight (Kymlicka 1995; Taylor\n1995). The limits of creeds\u2019 rights to exclude (or expel) are\nusually found in their harmfulness to non-members, whose interests,\nwhen push comes to shove, must take priority, in the name of equality\nof moral worth (White 1997: 383ff; Fine 2010: 352\u20133).\n\nSecond, expressive associations \u201care credited with enhancing the\nquality of democracy by cultivating citizenship and promoting open\nfora for public deliberation and self-government\u201d, opening up a\n\u201cparallel polis\u201d through a \u201cplurality of non-state\nsocial groups\u201d, by which the state can be kept in check and its\npowers limited (Craiutu 2008: 263\u20134; Levy 2014: 27). Put\ndifferently, one core function of many expressive associations or\n\u201cintermediate\u201d associations is to check the power of the\nstate. Intermediate groups give people an alternative to acting\nthrough the state. They enable people to act in concert and thereby\nmore easily resist the wrongful threats to personal freedom that\ngovernments can pose (Levy 2014: 1). An important part of preserving\nthis function of such associations is for a citizenry to become\naccustomed to the art of association, and to join with like-minded\npeople in the pursuit of what they perceive, in competition with\nothers, as the common good. This can only occur when groups are\nallowed to exclude people who have different understandings of that\ngood. In other words, to create genuine space for democratic dissent,\ngroups must be allowed to exclude people based on a principle of\nexpressive discrimination: such \u201cexpressive exclusion\u201d\nsits at the intersection of speech, association, and\ndemocracy (Bedi 2010).\n\nThird, expressive associations also have a role to play in increasing\nthe various \u201cexperiments of living\u201d to which people have\naccess. A plurality of opinions, creeds and ideologies increases the\nchance that people will find ways of life that suit them (Mill 1859:\nch. III). The diversity of ways of life that is fermented by allowing\ngroups to exclude people who fail to conform to their way of life, is\nsomething which also has collective value (Galston 1995: 523).\nHowever, Seana Shiffrin has argued for an alternative emphasis. In\nresponding to Dale v The Boy Scouts of America, in which the\nright of the Boy Scouts to exclude James Dale because of his\nhomosexuality was upheld, she suggests that we should think of such\nassociations less in terms of the messages they express to others,\ni.e., that the Boy Scouts as an institution does not endorse\nhomosexuality, and more in terms of the space that associations\nprovide. Specifically, associations offer a space for a person \n\n\nto control what influences she is exposed to, to what subjects she\ndirects her mind, and whether she, at all times, directs her mind\ntoward anything at all or instead \u201cspaces out\u201d and allows\nthe mind to relax and wander. (Shiffrin 2005: 841; cf. Farber 2001)\n\n\n\nIf we are constantly exposed to people or subjects with which we are\nunfamiliar or uncomfortable, or reminded of lifestyles or values that\nunsettle us, then a prime function of association is being upset. Of\ncourse, as we will see below, this associative protection might have\nadverse effects on other kinds of associative duty.\n\nCommercial associations vary from direct, tight-knit teams to\nlooser, long-distance networks. Commercial enterprises have as their\nmain purpose making, providing and selling goods and services to make\na profit. Employers have an interest in excluding people whom they\nregard as incapable of doing the job well because their work\nwon\u2019t be profitable. For the same reason, employers can have an\ninterest in excluding rabble rousers who aim to mobilize an otherwise\ncompliant workforce. Employees may well take a different view of their\nown interests with respect to their share of the profits, the optimum\npatterns of inclusions and exclusion within the enterprise, and the\ndegree of control they should have over shift-patterns, workload, and\nworking conditions (Nichols & Armstrong 1976: 82).\n\nThe differences in bargaining power between employees and employers\nhave led, historically, to the formation of particular kinds of\nassociations within the workplace. Trade unions form to protect\nemployees\u2019 position vis-\u00e0-vis their bosses, and\nthereby introduce some parity between these groups. In industries\nwhere conflict between capital and labor is pronounced, this can also\nissue in the right of unions to operate closed shops. In other words,\nanyone wishing to take employment must join the relevant union and,\nthus, employers can be denied access to potential employees who refuse\n(White 1998: 346\u2013347). Here then is a group right to compel\nassociation amongst a set of people\u2014with possible provisos for\nconscientious objectors\u2014to achieve the overall good of this\nassociational form, which is to make good on workers\u2019 basic\nrights (Rosenblum 1998; cf. Moreno 2008). However, implicitly, these\nmechanisms assume a particularly adversarial understanding of economic\nrelations, such that granting people this kind of group right can\nserve as a self-fulfilling prophecy, exacerbating what might otherwise\nbe congenial and mutually beneficial employer-employee relations. On\nsuch a view, the state might have to prevent freedom of association\namong the owners of capital, leading us into situations of monopoly.\nBut, beyond those kinds of provisions, the state should avoid\ninterfering with the spontaneous orderings that emerge from unimpeded\nassociation (Lomasky 2008; Epstein 2008; cf. Brody 1992 [1994:\n386]).\n\nExpressive and commercial associations are but two paradigms of\ncollective associations. The arguments for their right to\nexclude\u2014such as First Amendment-style rights or democracy in the\ncase of expressive associations and bargaining power within an\nadversarial relationship in the case of unions\u2014do not readily\napply to the activities of other collective associations such as\nrecreational groups, national groups, or cultural groups, which do not\nnecessarily qualify as expressive associations.\n\nRecreational associations: Members of a recreational group\nlike a chess club have interests in excluding people who would join\nwithout any intention of learning about chess or playing chess, but\nwith the (admittedly bizarre) desire to disrupt other people\u2019s\nenjoyment of the game. Minimal rules of inclusion are likely to refer\nto basic decency and decorum: a club might exclude people who swear\nprofusely during matches or react badly to losing. The right to\nexclude ensures the group can pursue such values as teamwork,\ncompetitive advantage, cohesiveness, autonomy, self-determination, and\nself-respect (McKinnon 2000: 498). In certain cases, a group may also\nwish to see a traditional pursuit continue because it is in danger of\nnot having enough adherents. Yet, the group might desire not just that\nthe pursuit survive, but that it survive for their group.\nThey might exclude some would-be participants so as to ensure the\nactivity is pursued by their specific community only. Were the\npractice to survive because of an increase in adherents outside this\ngroup, this might\u2014in the minds of members\u2014be a less\nvalued, even worthless result. Among other things, the group might\nregard the pursuit as a uniquely powerful means by which to bond\ntogether. This wish, though understandable at one level, becomes\nespecially troubling if exclusion is rooted in bigotry. The limits of\nsuch groups\u2019 rights to exclude turn largely on potential harms\nto non-members.\n\nCultural associations: Like commercial associations, cultural\nassociations vary from tight-knit clans to loose, anonymous\ncollectives. Cultural groups, sharing a common history, ethnicity,\nlanguage, and set of traditions, typically have distinct, persistent\nways of life. The Romani people, whose lifestyle is traditionally\nnomadic, are an example. Histories of colonization, conquest and\nannexation have destroyed many such groups\u2019 ways of life. Many\ncountries have laws banning, or hindering, a nomadic existence.\nHowever, though ravaged, the cultural practices and associational\nforms that make sense of members\u2019 conception of the good often\nremain in force. By preserving the associational forms of life that\nare organic to different communities, including their political\ndecision-making procedures and their patterns and practices of\ninclusion and exclusion, these cultural practices can also be made\nsustainable (Kymlicka 1995).\n\nNational and state associations: Given their size and nature,\nstates and nations seem to be peripheral examples of associations.\nNonetheless, if they are stable and enduring, they tick many of the\nboxes of meaningful association by offering a persistent, exclusive\nsocial context laden with common purposes that heavily inform our\nsense of identity. States use borders and border-control to exclude\nnon-members from their territories and to prevent them from acquiring\nmembership (Dagger 1985; Goodin 1988; Mason 1997: 442). Borders limit\nthe associative rights of people both within and without states\u2019\nboundaries. Such exclusion might be necessary to preserve a form and\nquality of citizenry-association that is conducive to a functioning\npolitical community. Of particular importance might be the need to\nsustain those forms of solidarity necessary to underpin social welfare\nprovisions (Miller 2016: 27). However, such exclusion can find its\nlimits when it bumps up against the basic human rights of would-be\nimmigrants. A state must justify its exclusionary practices before it\ncan justify treating its members better than it treats non-members. If\na state denies someone membership unjustifiably, it cannot appeal to\nthat person\u2019s non-membership to justify treating her less well\nthan it treats its members (Frick forthcoming).\nLimits to collective exclusion\n\nMeeting Basic Needs: As noted above, our freedom to associate\n(and disassociate) can often prevent particular people from enjoying\nthe goods of association since a person\u2019s positive right to\nassociate is shaped partly by other people\u2019s desire to associate\nor not with her. For some associations, this is not always\nproblematic. Friendship, for example, operates according to a mutual\ndesire to spend time together. Where this is lacking, a desire for the\nfriendship to be sustained, even from the person scorned, will likely,\nthough not always, dissipate. Unrequited love is another matter\naltogether. But, nobody believes that requiting love should\nbe imposed on anyone (though other associative duties might\nnonetheless emerge, perhaps with the end of letting the rejected\nperson down gradually).\n\nHowever, in certain contexts, our right to refuse to associate is\nhighly morally complex, such as when, for example, the excluded person\nhas a legitimate interest in the set of non-associative goods that we\nare denying her by excluding her. Take for example the right to\neducation. The Little Rock Nine who were turned away by National\nGuards at the doors of their school were primarily after a set of\ngoods, the value of which had nothing to do with association (Baldwin\n1958). The associational aspect was of little importance to either the\nstudents or their parents. Their right to an education and its\nopportunities conflicted with the alleged dissociative and expressive\nrights of the people who sought to deny them access to those goods.\nHere then, freedom of association was not really what was at stake.\nRather, the association was the means (more rightly perhaps, the\ncost) of claiming some other kind of right. The same\nprinciples can be applied to cases where someone seeks employment\namongst people with whom she would otherwise choose not to associate\n(cf. Lomasky 2008: 193ff).\n\nTake as another example the purposes served by recreational clubs.\nShould chess clubs be allowed to discriminate based on gender, for\nexample, in a boys\u2019 club that deprives interested girls of the\nopportunity to learn amongst peers and mentors, especially if no other\nchess club exists for girls to join? To suggest that the interested\ngirl is always free to set up her own chess club without trained\nmentors misses the point that chess is a game we learn best from\npeople already schooled in the activity and its tradition, and this\ncan often require resources to which she as an individual simply does\nnot have access (MacIntyre 1981 [1985: 194]). Given persisting biases\nabout whether girls can play chess well, a girls-only club, staffed by\nfemale mentors and peers, would be less problematic than a boys-only\nclub\u2014although there remain practical questions about how, in any\ngiven community, these are to be encouraged, established and\nmaintained. But, if perceptions changed such that society came to\ndoubt boys\u2019 ability to play chess at the highest levels, then\ngirls-only clubs would be more problematic than boys-only clubs. All\nthat said, new associations sometimes do form in reaction to the\nperceived prejudices of existing groups. In the wake of Dale v The\nBoy Scouts of America, new Scouting groups developed with more\ninclusive membership policies and more liberal ideas about who can be\na leader. While these groups might lack the historical prestige of the\nBoy Scouts of America, they at least solve the problem of\nscarcity.\n\nTake as a final example asylum seekers\u2019 fundamentally important\nneeds for assistance. Should nations\u2019 interests in\nself-governance take priority over such seekers\u2019 basic needs?\nGiven the intensity and severity of their needs, asylum seekers\u2019\nrights arguably take precedence over national interests in restricting\npeople\u2019s rights to free movement and association (Miller 2007;\ncf. Wellman 2008: 109). On the ground, this means that states must\nprocess applications of those asylum seekers who have reached their\njurisdiction. But, they do not have to open their borders to every\nperson anywhere in the world who is seeking refuge. Moreover, they may\nbe able to meet their obligations to such people without admitting\nthem to their own territories.\n\nAssociative Aspects of Other Personal Freedoms: When our\nright to exclude people prevents them from exercising other personal\nrights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion,\nand rights to educational opportunities, then a tension arises between\nthese competing freedoms. If someone is excluded from well-resourced\ngroups because of the color of her skin, then her ability to develop\nher \u201cpolitical opinions, engage in literary and artistic\npursuits and other cultural, economic and social activities\u201d (UN\nHuman Rights Council resolution 15/21, preamble) is undermined.\nEnsuring that her rights to equal respect, consideration, and fair\nopportunity are secured means protecting her from unjust\ndiscrimination by checking others\u2019 rights to be exclusive (White\n1997: 383ff).\n\nIn commercial domains, businesses can form, or refuse to form,\nassociations with certain customers through commercial exchanges. A\nbusiness might assert a right not to engage in certain kinds of\nexchanges with customers: the Christian owners of the Ashers Bakery in\nNorthern Ireland refused to bake a cake with a slogan supporting\ngay-marriage. Their objection, they said, was to the message\nfor the cake, not to the customers requesting the cake. By contrast, a\nblack photographer might assert a right to refuse a commission to\nphotograph a Neo-Nazi group that is holding a conference on their\nviews. In that case, her objection would be both to the message and to\nthe customers seeking her services.\n\nCompelling State Interest I (Equality): The state has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring that its citizens have access to those\ngoods that allow them to participate fully in the life of the\ncommunity. As such, the state has its own claim-rights and powers\ngrounded in these interests. Women\u2019s rights to gain access to\nthe privileges and advantages bestowed on members of commercial\ninstitutions, ethnic minorities\u2019 rights to live in safe\nneighborhoods irrespective of what local neighborhood associations\nmight fear (Anderson 2010), children\u2019s rights to attend properly\nequipped schools despite the racial prejudices of other students or\ntheir parents, and the rights of traditionally excluded groups to have\nemployment opportunities, all count as state interests that are\ncompelling enough to limit our rights to be exclusive. \n\nAnother potentially compelling interest we have is in being protected\nagainst the consequences of membership in our own\nassociations. There is a tension, for instance, between the demands a\ncommunity makes of its citizens and the impact that parental authority\ncan have on children\u2019s ability to learn about those demands.\nFocusing on the case of Wisconsin v Yoder (406 U.S. 205\n(1972)), which ruled that Amish parents\u2019 constitutionally\nprotected freedom of religion allowed them to take their children out\nof state education after the eighth grade, Richard Arneson and Ian\nShapiro note that these parents\u2019 wishes to remove their children\nfrom school after the eighth grade might interfere with their children\nlearning about the civic duties necessary to be effective members of\nthe wider political community, rendering them ill-equipped to\nparticipate in that community. In such cases, Amish children\u2019s\nassociative rights and concomitant duties as US citizens are adversely\naffected by their parents\u2019 desires to sustain their own\nassociative preferences (Arneson & Shapiro 1996; cf. Galston 1995:\n518\u2013520). More broadly, we can speak of children having a right\nto an \u201copen future\u201d, which includes rights to freedom of\nassociation. As Joel Feinberg puts it, a proper education\n\u201cequips the child with the knowledge and skills that will help\nhim choose whatever form of life fits his native disposition and\nmature disposition\u201d (Feinberg 1980 [1992: 84]). This open\nfuture, with its range of associative opportunities, is effectively\nforeclosed when a child is removed from a sufficiently advanced,\nformal education.\n\nIf the imperative to keep a child\u2019s future open is not weighed\nappropriately against parents\u2019 rights to influence their\nchild\u2019s development, oppressive consequences can follow. In\nXinjiang province in North West China, the state has taken active\nmeasures to prevent young people from the Uighur majority from\nengaging in Islamic practices, forbidding people under 18 from\nentering Mosques and preventing them from using their native tongue in\nclassrooms. In defending these policies, the Chinese state argues that\nit does this both to prevent what they perceive as the threat of\nterroristic activities (see d) below) and to keep open\nchildren\u2019s possibilities to grow up with a more open future than\nthey would have if they are inculcated in traditional Islamic\npractices. We can test the credibility of such defenses, specifically\nas they relate to threats of terrorism, by examining the community\nhistory, attitudes, and general behaviors of the people who are denied\naccess to those religious practices.\n\nCompelling State Interest II (Keeping the Peace): Exclusion\ncan serve the development of associations which make it their target\nto destroy the state and the social peace. Terrorist groups for\nexample will exclude people who are unsympathetic to the violent means\nthey advocate, even though they may share doctrinal or creedal\nsimilarities. Exclusion here thus allows particular beliefs and\nintentions to thrive unchallenged. Such exclusion conflicts also with\nboth other people\u2019s general rights to associate as they please\nand the other goods that social peace makes possible. As a result, a\n\u201ccompelling state interest\u201d can prevent certain\nassociations from forming or staying together. In some cases, the\nstate has a compelling interest to compel, i.e., force, associations,\nsuch as those achieved through desegregation, even when desegregation\ncan (and historically did) trigger violent responses. In other cases,\nthe state might claim that it has a compelling interest to prevent the\nfree associations of, for example, communists or anarchists of various\nstripes (Hook 1953; Whittington 2008).\n\nHowever, in connection with this \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d\ninterest, an array of other interests can be served or hindered when\nwe seek to justify state action against particular associations. For\ninstance, states and power-players sometimes use accusations of\n\u201cmoral disorder\u201d and \u201cthreats of anarchy\u201d\nagainst workers assembling for their rights to vote. Matthew\nArnold\u2019s reaction to the 1866 Hyde Park demonstrations, for\ninstance, described such demands as \u201ctending to anarchy\u201d\nand called that order be imposed on such assemblages for the sake of\ncivilization (Mitchell 2003: 13\u201314). Perception is an important\npart of \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d. Where a group of people\nperceive another group as a threat, keeping the peace might involve\nappeasing them in their false picture of reality. Alternatively, other\npeople might view seemingly disruptive associations as agitating for a\nmore just political settlement. What this shows is that an\nassociation\u2019s intentions always come with a certain level of\nopacity, which complicates the task of adjudicating between legitimate\nand illegitimate exercises of associative rights. It also complicates\nthe task of drawing the limits of those rights: When struggles ensue\nbetween certain groups and the state, the state often uses intrusive\ntactics to render those groups\u2019 aims transparent, such as police\ninfiltration, surveillance, discrediting, and disrupting, to manage,\nundermine or destroy such organizations. How we judge these state\nmeasures will ultimately depend on the seriousness of the perceived\nthreats that these groups pose.\n",
