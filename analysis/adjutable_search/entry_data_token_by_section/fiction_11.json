    "main_text": "Truth in Fiction || Truth in Fiction and the Role of \u201cAuthors\u201d\n2.3 Truth in Fiction and the Role of \u201cAuthors\u201d\n\nCurrie\u2019s answer to the problem of the unreliable narrator is\nquite different. His account of what is true in fiction eschews any\nappeal to worlds in favor and appeal to the beliefs of someone he\ncalls the fictional author:\n\nC \u201cIn\nthe fiction F, \u03c6\u201d is\ntrue iff it is reasonable for the informed reader to infer that the\nfictional author of F believes that \u03c6 (Currie 1990:\n80).\n\n\nHere the fictional author is \u201cthat fictional character\nconstructed within our make-believe whom we take to be telling us the\nstory as known fact\u201d (Currie 1990: 76), and the \u201cinformed\nreader\u201d is a reader who knows the relevant facts about the\ncommunity in which the work was written (1990: 97). The view also\noffers a distinctive way of dealing with the problem of unreliable\nnarrators. When the evidence suggests that a narrator is unreliable,\nwe are supposed to construct a hidden, completely reliable and\nknowledgeable fictional author who is \u201cspeaking with the voice\nof one of the (unreliable) characters in the story\u201d (1990: 125);\nthe reader figures out what is true in the story by forming an\nimpression of the beliefs of the author, based on the text of the\nstory and facts about its community of origin. While many commentators\nhave lauded the move away from possible worlds, a number have doubted\nthat positing such an author is adequate to the task of explaining\ntruth in fiction (e.g., Byrne 1993; Howard-Snyder 2002; Swirski 2014),\neven complaining that it seems gratuitous to postulate \u201csome\nshadowy meta-narrator who has all true beliefs but is choosing not to\nreveal himself\u201d just to deal with a narrator who is unreliable\n(Matravers 1995; see Currie 1995a, 1995b for further discussion, and\nCurrie 2010 for a more sceptical perspective on internal narrators).\nOther philosophers have offered alternative accounts of the (real,\nhypothetical, \u2026) authors whose beliefs or intentions determine what is\ntrue in fiction.  Stock, for example, argues for an extreme\nintentionalism on which, with some important qualifications aside,\nwhat is true in a fiction is what the real author intends her audience\nto imagine as being true (Stock 2017).  Others prefer more moderate\nappeals to the real author (e.g., Livingston 2005, for whom fictional\ntruth rests on what it is appropriate to make believe, given a goal of\nunderstanding fictive utterances in the author\u2019s artistic context).\n\n\nAlex Byrne has a final criticism that he thinks affects Currie\u2019s\nand Lewis\u2019s accounts of truth in fiction in equal measure. It is\neasy to see that if F is a fiction then the sentence \u201cIn\nfiction F, F is told as known fact\u201d is true for\nboth Lewis and Currie. Byrne (1993) labels this consequence of the two\nviews idealism, and he offers two objections. First, certain\nfictions are what Currie calls mindless: fictions in which\nthere is no intelligent life, and so no one to tell the tale. In such\nstories, it is false that there is someone who is telling the story.\nSecond, postulating knowing tellers would suggest quite extraordinary\nepistemic capacities on the part of these tellers in the case of\nfictions that carry detailed information about the psychology of\ncharacters, say. Currie\u2019s response to the first kind of\ncomplaint is that the postulation of a teller for every tale is simply\na staple of literary and aesthetic theory (Currie 1990: 75\u20136).\nIf so, not worrying about how the teller got her information (it is\nenough that she must have got it somehow or other; cf. Hanley 2004)\nmight be another such staple.\n\nOne worry about such a response is that it seems little different from\nsaying we should treat the story as if it were told from a God\u2019s\neye point of view. But the response is probably best treated as an\ninstance of something far more general: an appropriately dismissive\nattitude to certain sorts of questions. Walton calls questions of this\ntype \u201csilly questions\u201d. One of his many examples concerns\nthe way Othello is able to come up with superb verse\u2014in English\ntoo!\u2014despite his great distress; another one concerns the way\nnarrators in literary works tell of events they could not possibly\nknow about (Walton 1990: 174ff). In Walton\u2019s view, we should\nsimply stop worrying about the apparent threat posed by questions of\nthis kind, perhaps by disallowing or de-emphasizing offending\nfictional truths (such as that Othello was a great literary talent, or\nthat the narrator was somehow able to determine that the characters in\na novel \u201clived happily ever after\u201d (1990: 177\u20138)).\nSuch questions are \u201clargely if not entirely irrelevant to\nappreciation and criticism\u201d (Walton 1990: 238). If this is\nright, there is little reason to think that idealism of the kind Byrne\nobjects to constitutes a fatal defect in the approaches of either\nCurrie or Lewis.\n\nByrne himself defines truth in fiction in terms of what a Reader can\ninfer about what the Author invites him to make-believe, where the\nReader and Author are idealised entities identified in terms of\npragmatic principles of interpretation.  This allows Byrne to explain\nhow it can be true in a story that there is no one left to tell the\ntale and why it is rarely true in stories that there exists someone\nwith unexplained and extraordinary epistemological powers who knows\nthe deepest thoughts of others (Byrne 1993). The same conclusion is\navailable on some other author-based views, such as those of\nLivingston 2005 and Stock 2017. In fact, all such approaches promise\nto deliver a fairly direct way of defusing \u201csilly questions\u201d\nconcerning truth in fiction.\n\n\nWhatever the best way of dealing with the issue of \u201cidealism\u201d, it is\nan issue that affects Lewis and Currie in equal measure. But there is\nanother issue that some take to be an important reason for preferring\nan author-based account like Currie\u2019s to a possible worlds-based\naccount like Lewis\u2019s, namely what sense to make of truth in impossible\nfictions, a topic we turn to next.\n\n",
