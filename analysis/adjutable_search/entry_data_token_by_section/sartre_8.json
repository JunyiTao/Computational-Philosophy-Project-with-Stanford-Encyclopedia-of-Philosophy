    "main_text": "Existentialist Marxism: Critique of Dialectical Reason\n7. Politics and Anti-Colonialism\n\nAlthough it is not possible to address all of Sartre\u2019s rich and\nvaried contributions to ethics and politics here, we will introduce\nsome of the key ideas about race and anti-colonialism that were\nimportant themes in his post Being and Nothingness work and\nare currently significant issues in our times. Sartre was generally\nstridently anti-colonialist, perhaps even advocating a\nmulticulturalism avant la lettre, as Michael Walzer has\nargued in his Preface to Anti-semite and Jew (Walzer 1995:\nxiv). His books and more journalistic writings typically call out what\nhe saw as the bad faith of many French and European citizens.\n\nThe issue of race was part of Sartre\u2019s French intellectual\nscene, and Sartre himself played a major role in facilitating that in\nthe pages of Les Temps Modernes, L\u2019Express,\nand elsewhere. Debates about the intersection of philosophy and race,\nand colonialism and multiculturalism, were all being had. These\nconcerned not only the French Algerian and African\n\u201ccolonies\u201d but also Vietnam via Tran Duc Thao, who had\nchallenged Sartre\u2019s efforts to bring phenomenological\nexistentialism together with Marxism. Initially at least,\nSartre\u2019s arguments here typically drew on and extended some of\nthe categories deployed in Being and Nothingness. There is an\nobvious sense in which a critique of racism automatically ensues from\nSartrean existentialism. Racism is a form of bad faith, for Sartre,\nsince it typically (perhaps necessarily) involves believing in\nessences or types, and indeed constructing essences and types. His\nNotebooks suggest that all oppression rests on bad faith. In\nracism, in particular, there is an \u201cinfernal circle of\nirresponsible responsibility, of culpable ignorance and ignorance\nwhich is knowledge\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956: 49]),\nas well as what Sartre calls\npassive complicity. Many of us (or Sartre\u2019s own French society)\nmay not obviously be bigots, but we sustain a system that is\nobjectively unjust through our choices and sometimes wilful ignorance.\nIn relation to colonialism, Sartre likewise contends that we have all\nprofited from colonialist exploitation and sustained its systems, even\nif we are not ourselves a \u201csettler\u201d.\n\nThis is also the key argument of Anti-semite and the Jew,\ncomposed very quickly in 1944 and without much detailed knowledge of\nJudaism but with more direct knowledge of the sort of passive\nanti-semitism of many French citizens. The text was written following\nthe Dreyfus affair and before all of the horrors of the holocaust were\nwidely known. Sartre was aiming to understand (and critique) the\nsituation he observed around him, in which the imminent return of the\nFrench Jews exiled by the Nazis was not unambiguously welcomed by all.\nThe book is perceptive about its prime targets, the explicit or\nimplicit anti-semite, who defines the real Frenchmen by excluding\nothers, notably the Jew. Now, of course, few of his contemporaries\nwould admit to being anti-semites, just as few would admit to being\nracist. But there are patterns of bad faith that Sartre thinks are\nclear: we participate in social systems that force the dilemma of\nauthenticity or inauthenticity upon the Jew, asking them to choose\nbetween their concrete practical identities (religious and cultural)\nand more universal ascriptions (liberty, etc.) in a way that cannot be\nreadily navigated within the terms of the debate. Sartre consistently\nascribes responsibility to collectives here, even if those collectives\nare ultimately sustained by individual decisions and choices. For him,\nit is not just the assassin say, nor just Eichmann and the Nazi\nregime, who are held responsible. Rather, these more obviously\negregious activities were sustained by their society and the\nindividuals in it, through culpable ignorance and patterns of bad\nfaith.\n\nSartre also addressed the negritude movement in his Preface to\nBlack Orpheus (1948), an anthology of negritude poetry. He\ncalled for an anti-racist racism and saw himself as resolutely on the\nside of the negritude movement, but he also envisaged such\ninterventions as a step towards ultimately revealing the category of\nrace itself as an example of bad faith. Here the reception from Frantz\nFanon and others was mixed. In Black Skin, White Masks\n(1952), Fanon argues this effectively undermined his own\nlived-experience and its power (see entries on\n negritude\n and\n Fanon;\n cf. also Gordon 1995). Sartre continued to address colonialism and\nracism in subsequent work, effecting a rapprochement of sorts with\nFanon that culminated in his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to\nFanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth (1961), where also\nSartre appears to endorse a counter-violence. \n\nAlthough we have not given much attention to Sartre\u2019s literary\nand artistic productions since\n section 3\n above, he continued to produce artistic work of political\nsignificance throughout his career. Continuous with insights from his\nWhat is Literature?, Sartre argues that in a society that\nremains unjust and dominated by oppression, the prose-writer (if not\nthe poet) must combat this violence by jolting the reader and audience\nfrom their complacency, rather than simply be concerned with art for\nits own sake. His literary works hence are typically both\nphilosophical and political. Although the number of these works\ndiminished over time, there is still a powerful literary exploration\nof the philosophical and political themes of the Critique in\nthe play, The Condemned of Altona (1960).\n\nWe cannot neatly sum up a public intellectual and man of letters, like\nSartre, to conclude. We do think, however, that it is arguable, with\nthe benefit of hindsight, that some of Sartre\u2019s interventions\nare prescient rather than outmoded remnants of the nineteenth century\n(\u00e0 la Foucault). They certainly presage issues that\nare in the foreground today, concerning class, race, and gender. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that Sartre got it all correct, of course, whatever\nthat might mean in regard to the complex realities of socio-political\nlife. Indeed, if one is to take a stand on so many of the major\nsocio-political issues of one\u2019s time, as Sartre did, it is\ninevitable that history will not look kindly on them all.\nSartre\u2019s life and writings hence present a complex and difficult\ninterpretive task, but they remain a powerful provocation for thought\nand action today.\n",
