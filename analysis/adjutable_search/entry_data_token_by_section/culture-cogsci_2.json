    "main_text": "A First Pass at the Subject Matter || What is Culture?\n1.2 What is Culture?\n\nWhile \u2018cognitive science\u2019 refers to an approach\nto studying a particular set of phenomena,\n\u2018culture\u2019 would appear to refer directly to a type of\nphenomenon, rather than a way of investigating it. This much may seem\nuncontroversial, but little else about culture (or\n\u2018culture\u2019) is (Risjord 2012; Lenard 2020). Before it\nbecame central to the social sciences and humanities, the term had a\nlife of its own outside of academia, where it was primarily used to\nrefer to the training of mental capacities in humans. In this sense,\n\u2018culture\u2019 was roughly synonymous with\n\u2018education\u2019: a cultured individual was an educated person,\nand the qualities of educated people, and the things that educated\npeople produced and consumed, were construed as cultural (Jahoda\n2012). Vernacular usage has retained many of these connotations, and\nsome of the more technical uses of \u2018culture\u2019 remain\nindebted to these folk origins. Still, most contemporary academic\nunderstandings of the subject matter have been greatly influenced by\nthe work of eighteenth-century philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder,\nwhose approach to culture emphasized how human thinking and behavior\nare extremely flexible, and steered by environmental variation and\nsocial learning (Denby 2005).\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, historical influences\nlike these informed numerous conceptions of culture, with differences\nbetween them often reflecting the different theoretical work the\nnotion was being asked to do. By the middle of the century, Kroeber\nand Kluckhohn were able to identify more than 150 definitions, making\nexplicit numerous views about what was required of the concept, and\nthe demands placed on the it by different fields and theorists\n(Kroeber & Kluckhorn 1952). A more recent overview (Baldwin et al.\n2006) argues that definitions of \u2018culture\u2019 currently in\nuse can be placed into one of seven genres based on what they take as\ntheir central theme: structure/pattern, function, process, product,\nrefinement, power/ideology, or group membership. The fact that\ncognitive scientists are mostly concerned with patterns, processes,\nand functions is reflected in this entry, but it is worth noting that\nthe other themes tend to attract more attention from adjacent academic\ndisciplines. For example, political philosophers and critical\ntheorists examining postmodernism and postcolonialism often analyze\npower relations in terms of \u2018dominant cultures\u2019 (Gemignani\n& Pe\u00f1a 2007), while those doing aesthetics often\nconcentrate on material artifacts that count as \u2018cultural\nproducts\u2019 and part of a \u2018cultural heritage\u2019\n(Hammersley 2019). In sociology and much of cultural anthropology, the\nemphasis is often on non-material cultural products such as beliefs,\nvalues, and norms, and on how these serve to structure human social\narrangements (Sewell 2005). Edward Tylor, the founding father of\ncultural anthropology, famously articulated a holistic variation on\nthis theme, describing culture as\n\n\nthat complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law,\ncustom, and any other capacities acquired by man as a member of\nsociety. (Tylor 1871: 1)\n\n\nThe diversity of the theoretical aims and approaches across academic\ndisciplines interested in culture, along with the inherent complexity\nof those phenomena identified as cultural, have also inspired\npessimistic conclusions. Some have argued against the possibility of a\nunified conception of culture, suggesting no single definition could\nsatisfy all of the demands placed on the term and still be coherent or\ntheoretically useful (Byrne, Barnard, et al. 2004; Segall 1984).\nOthers have argued that the lack of such a single univocal definition\nwould be no hinderance to scientific research, since no single\nidealization of the idea of culture will be equally useful for all\nexplanatory purposes (Sperber & Claidi\u00e8re 2008). That said,\nmany contend that in order to clarify what culture does and does not\ndo, refined conceptual tools are needed to think clearly about its\ndifferent manifestations and facets, and especially to distinguish it\nfrom related but importantly distinct phenomena such as ecological\ninheritance (Odling-Smee & Laland 2011) and epigenetics (Jahoda\n1984; Jablonka & Lamb 2005). In light of this, Ramsey\u2019s\nrecent explication (2013) of a conception of culture that is both\ncurrently influential and that has a venerable history (Cavalli-Sforza\n& Feldman 1981; R. Boyd & Richerson 1985) is well-suited to\nserve as a touchstone for this entry:\n\n\nCulture is information transmitted between individuals or groups,\nwhere this information flows through and brings about the reproduction\nof, and a lasting change in, the behavioral trait. (Ramsey 2013:\n466)\n\n\nCognitive science research using alternative conceptions of culture\nwill be noted below (see especially\n Section 2.2).\n",
