    "main_text": "\n\nRudolph Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) mediated the\ntransition from the exuberance of German idealism, in the first half\nof the nineteenth century, to the sober, scholarly and scientific\nethos that came to prevail in the second half. He adapted the notion\nof \u201cchief\u201d or defining problems in the philosophical\nsub-disciplines, inherited from Herbart, and brought opposing\napproaches to bear on them, in a quasi-systematic way, preparing the\nway for the modern textbook. A professor in a changing situation,\nmoving toward bureaucratic centralization in an encompassing national\nstate, he mostly restricted his attention to academic issues,\nappealing to his peers (but not the public) in the now rising\nprofessional journal (while maintaining a lively interest in things\nquotidian). Given the increasing amounts of data and the rising\nimportance of the burgeoning new disciplines, Lotze hoped to preserve\na special place for philosophy as a value-theoretic investigation.\nLotze\u2019s influence was far-reaching and not yet widely admitted\nor well understood. While he accidentally inspired numerous\nmaterialists (and was simultaneously claimed by the idealists), his\nstrong association with certain traditionalist preachers, on the one\nhand, and liberal theological movements, on the other, blunted his\ninterest for the philosophical revolutionaries of the twentieth\ncentury, while simultaneously preserving a continued line of\nsubterranean influence.\n",
