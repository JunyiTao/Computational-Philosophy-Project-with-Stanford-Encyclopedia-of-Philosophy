    "main_text": "Convention || Later Revisions\n2.3 Later Revisions\n\nIn \u201cLanguages and Language\u201d (1975b), Lewis makes two major\nrevisions to the picture presented in Convention. He changes\nthe account of what a convention is, and he changes the account of\njust what convention must obtain in order for a population to speak a\nlanguage.\n\nThere are two changes to the account of convention. First, Lewis now\nsays that conventions may be regularities in action and belief, rather\nthan just in action. Second, he weakens the third condition, which was\napproximate sameness of preferences, to the condition that (almost)\neach agent has a reason to conform when they believe others conform.\nThe reason in question may be a practical reason, when conformity\nrequires action, or an epistemic reason, when convention requires\nbelief.\n\nIn Convention, the conventions that sustained language were\nregularities amongst speakers. As we noted, it would be more natural\nto say that the conventions solved co-ordination problems between\nspeakers of a language and their hearers. That is what the new account\nof what it is for a population to speak a language does. The\npopulation P speaks the language L iff there are\nconventions of truthfulness and trust in L. Speakers are\ntruthful in L if and only if they only utter sentences they\nbelieve are true sentences of L. Hearers are trusting in\nL if and only if they take the sentences they hear to be\n(generally) true sentences of L.\n\nThe old account took linguistic conventions to be grounded in\nco-ordination between speakers generally. We each communicate in\nEnglish because we think we\u2019ll be understood that way given\neveryone else communicates that way, and we want to be understood. In\nthe new account there is still this kind of many-way co-ordination\nbetween all the speakers of a language, but the most basic kind of\nco-ordination is a two-way co-ordination between individual speakers,\nwho want to be understood, and hearers, who want to understand. This\nseems like a more natural starting point. The new account also makes\nit possible for someone to be part of a population that uses a\nlanguage even if they don\u2019t say anything because they\ndon\u2019t have anything to say. As long as they are trusting in\nL, they are part of the population that conforms to the\nlinguistic regularity.\n\nJohn Hawthorne (1990) argued that Lewis\u2019s account cannot explain\nthe intuitive meaning of very long sentences. While not accepting all\nof Hawthorne\u2019s reasons as to why very long sentences are a\nproblem, in \u201cMeaning Without Use: Reply to Hawthorne\u201d\n(1992a) Lewis agreed that such sentences pose a problem to his view.\nTo see the problem, let L be the function from each sentence\nof English to its intuitive truth condition, and let L* be\nthe restriction of that function to sentences that aren\u2019t very\nlong. Arguably we do not trust speakers who utter very long sentences\nto have uttered truths, under the ordinary English interpretation of\ntheir sentences. We think, as Lewis said, that such speakers are\n\u201ctrying to win a bet or set a record, or feigning madness or\nraving for real, or doing it to annoy, or filibustering, or making an\nexperiment to test the limits of what it is humanly possible to say\nand mean.\u201d (Lewis 1992a: 108) That means that while there may be\na convention of truthfulness and trust in L*, there is no\nconvention of trust in L in its full generality. So the\n\u201cLanguages and Language\u201d theory implies that we speak\nL*, not L, which is wrong.\n\nLewis\u2019s solution to this puzzle relies on his theory of natural\nproperties, described below in Section 4.6. He argues that some\ngrammars (in the above sense of grammar) are more natural than others.\nBy default, we speak a language with a natural grammar. Since\nL has a natural grammar, and L* doesn\u2019t, other\nthings being equal, we should be interpreted as speaking L\nrather than L*. Even if other things are not quite equal,\ni.e. we don\u2019t naturally trust speakers of very long sentences,\nif there is a convention of truthfulness and trust in L in\nthe vast majority of verbal interactions, and there is no other\nlanguage with a natural grammar in which there is a convention of\ntruthfulness and truth, then the theory will hold, correctly, that we\ndo speak L.\n",
