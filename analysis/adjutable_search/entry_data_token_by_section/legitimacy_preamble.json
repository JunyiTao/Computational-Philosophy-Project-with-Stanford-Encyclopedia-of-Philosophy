    "main_text": "\n\nPolitical legitimacy is a virtue of political institutions and of the\ndecisions\u2014about laws, policies, and candidates for political\noffice\u2014made within them. This entry will survey the main answers\nthat have been given to the following questions. First, how should\nlegitimacy be defined? Is it primarily a descriptive or a normative\nconcept? If legitimacy is understood normatively, what does it entail?\nSome associate legitimacy with the justification of coercive power and\nwith the creation of political authority. Others associate it with the\njustification, or at least the sanctioning, of existing political\nauthority. Authority stands for a right to rule\u2014a right to issue\ncommands and, possibly, to enforce these commands using coercive\npower. An additional question is whether legitimate political\nauthority is understood to entail political obligations or not. Most\npeople probably think it does. But some think that the moral\nobligation to obey political authority can be separated from an\naccount of legitimate authority, or at least that such obligations\narise only if further conditions hold.\n\nNext there are questions about the requirements of legitimacy. When\nare political institutions and the decisions made within them\nappropriately called legitimate? Some have argued that this question\nmust be answered primarily on the basis of procedural features of\npolitical decision-making. Others argue that legitimacy\ndepends\u2014exclusively or at least in part\u2014on the substantive\nvalues that are realized. And on what grounds is the procedure versus\nsubstance question to be settled, is it on moral grounds\u2014\nrelating to values such as freedom or equality\u2014or is it on\nepistemic grounds\u2014relating to the epistemic merits of how\npolitical decisions are made? A related question is: does political\nlegitimacy demand democracy or not? Insofar as democracy is seen as\nnecessary for political legitimacy, when are democratic decisions\nlegitimate? Can that question be answered with reference to procedural\nfeatures only, or does democratic legitimacy depend both on procedural\nvalues and on the quality of the decisions made? And what is the role\nof epistemic considerations in this regard? Finally, there is the\nquestion which political institutions are subject to the legitimacy\nrequirement. Historically, legitimacy was associated with the state\nand institutions and decisions within the state. The contemporary\nliterature tends to judge this as too narrow, however. This raises the\nquestion how the concept of legitimacy may apply\u2014beyond the\nnation state and decisions made within it\u2014to the international\nand global context.\n",
