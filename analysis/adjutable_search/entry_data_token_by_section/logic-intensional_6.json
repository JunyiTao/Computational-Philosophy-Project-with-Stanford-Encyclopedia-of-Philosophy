    "main_text": "A Brief History || Montague, Tich\u00fd, Bressan, and Gallin\n2.5 Montague, Tich\u00fd, Bressan, and Gallin\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s ideas were extended and formalized by Richard Montague, Pavel\nTich\u00fd, and Aldo Bressan, independently. All made use of some version\nof Kripke/Hintikka possible world semantics, instead of the more specialized\nstructure of Carnap. All treated intensions functionally.\n\n\nIn part, Bressan wanted to provide a logical foundation for physics. The connection\nwith physics is this. When we say something has such-and-such a mass,\nfor instance, we mean that if we had conducted certain experiments, we\nwould have gotten certain results. This does not assume we did conduct\nthose experiments, and thus alternate states (or cases, as Bressan\ncalls them) arise. Hence there is a need for a rich modal language,\nwith an ontology that includes numbers as well as physical objects. In\nBressan 1972, an elaborate modal system was developed, with a full\ntype hierarchy including numbers as in Principia Mathematica.\n\n\nMontague\u2019s work is primarily in Montague 1960 and 1970, and has natural\nlanguage as its primary motivation. The treatment is\nsemantic, but in Gallin 1975 an axiom system is presented. The\nlogic Gallin axiomatized is a full type-theoretic system,\nwith intensional objects of each type. Completeness is proved relative\nto an analog of Henkin models, familiar for higher type classical\nlogics.\n\n\nTich\u00fd created a system of intensional logic very similar to\nthat of Montague, beginning, in English, in Tich\u00fd 1971, with a\ndetailed presentation in Tich\u00fd 1988. Unfortunately his work did\nnot become widely known. Like Montague\u2019s semantics,\nTich\u00fd\u2019s formal work is based on a type hierarchy with\nintensions mapping worlds to extensions at each type level, but it\ngoes beyond Montague in certain respects. For one thing, intensions\ndepend not only on worlds, but also on times. For another, in addition\nto intensions and extensions Tich\u00fd also\nconsiders constructions. The idea is that expressions\ndetermine intensions and extensions, and this itself is a formal\nprocess in which compound expressions act using the simpler\nexpressions that go into their making; compositionality at the level\nof constructions, in other words. Using this formal machinery,\n\u201c\\(1+4\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(2+3\\)\u201d prescribe different\nconstructions; their meaning is not simply captured by their\nintensional representation as discussed here.\n",
