He claims that\nthe world contains both goodness and badness and he postulates two\nantithetical principles to account for each one of them (De\nIside 369C\u2013D), since God can only be the principle of\ngoodness (ibid; cf. Republic 379c, Theaetetus\n176a). And he criticizes the Epicureans and the Stoics, who postulate\neither matter (the atoms) or god respectively as active principles of\nthe world (De Iside 369A). Plutarch expresses his dualism\nalso in religious-symbolic terms: he equates the pair of good and evil\nprinciples with the Persian pair of gods Oromazes and Areimanius\n(De Iside 369D\u2013E). Plutarch's pervasive dualism gives\nrise to problems, however. The constant presence and operation of the\ndisorderly, non-rational aspect of the soul in the universe (De\nan. procr. 1027A), implies God's failure totally to\ndominate. Plutarch appears to maintain that God's power is limited by\nthe necessity (anank\u00ea) imposed by matter. Yet, on the\nother hand, he does distinguish between the rule of nature, or fate,\non the one hand, and divine providence on the other, arguing, against\nthe Stoics, that God can dominate nature (De facie 927A-B)\nand can function providentially for us (De comm. not. 1075E,\nDe Iside 371A, De defect oraculorum 413E\n\u2013Ammonius speaking). The fact that God, by means of his\nlogos, with which he is often identified (De Iside\n373A-B), moulds the principle of disorder, the Indefinite Dyad,\nsuggests to Plutarch the supremacy of God over any other force. This\nis actually one of the reasons why Plutarch defends temporal creation;\nif the world were eternal and God responsible for it, then God would\nbe the cause of both good and bad, while on Plutarch's interpretation\nof the Timaeus badness is accounted for by the evil world\nsoul, which, as I said above, according to Plutarch is pre-cosmic (see\nDillon 2002, 234; see also below, sect. 4.3).\n\nThe problem however remains. It becomes more serious if we move from\nthe cosmic macrocosm to the human microcosm. If disorder,\nnon-rationality, and badness are cosmic forces, producing what is bad\nin the world, the question is how they relate to the bad or the vice\ncaused by human beings. Plutarch distinguishes three causes, fate,\nchance, and ourselves as causes of what is up to us, all of which play\na role in what happens to us (Quaest. Conv. 740C-D). The\nfirst two kinds of causes need some explanation in view of Plutarch's\nmetaphysical principles. Presumably, fate amounts to God, chance to\nthe non-rational part of the world soul, since the latter can bring\nabout events not planned by God which are disorderly and evil.\nPlutarch's distinction amounts to three classes of events. Some events\nare fated (or planned by God), some happen by chance (or through the\noperation of the non-rational aspect of the world soul), while there\nis a third class of events for which we, humans, are the only causes\n(De tranq. an. 476E). We can, Plutarch says, decide what to\ndo, how to live our lives, but not how life will turn out in terms of\ndesired or intended outcomes of our actions (ibid. 467A-B; Eliasson\n2008, 130\u2013141). He criticizes the Stoics for violating this\ndistinction, arguing that the Stoic notion of \u201cthat which is up\nto us\u201d coincides with the Stoic notion of fate (De Stoic.\nrepugn. 1056E-D). In view of that evidence Plutarch may appear to\ndefend human freedom, but the problem remains, since it is still\nunclear how the human's participation in the intelligible realm\nthrough soul and intellect, sharing the characteristics of the\n(originally non-rational) world soul and the (naturally rational)\ndivine intellect, shapes one's character and accounts for one's\nactions in life.\n",
