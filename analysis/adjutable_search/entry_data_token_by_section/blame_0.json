    "main_text": "What is Blame?\n1. What is Blame?\n\nTo begin, note that almost all philosophical discussions of blame\nignore (or mention only to set aside) the form of blame sometimes\ncharacterized as causal or explanatory responsibility (Kenner 1967;\nHart 1968; Beardsley 1969). It is this notion of blame that is at\nstake when we say that Hurricane Hugo is to blame for the destruction\nof Charleston\u2019s harbor, or that the cat is to blame for knocking over\nthe vase. Theorists contrast this sense of \u201cblame\u201d with\nthe sort of interpersonal blame that, for example, one gives\nup when one forgives. (As Pamela Hieronymi (2001) has pointed out,\nforgiveness in fact requires not giving up one\u2019s judgment\nthat the other person is explanatorily to blame.) But just\nwhat the relation is between causal blame and interpersonal blame is\nan important question that has not been well-explored. Nevertheless,\nin this entry the focus will be on the latter form of blame, which is\na response to moral agents on the basis of their wrong, bad, or\notherwise objectionable actions, attitudes, or characters.\n\nTheories of blame could be organized in a number of different ways,\ndepending on one\u2019s purposes. Consider three of these possible ways.\nFirst, we could categorize theories of blame according to the\ncontent of blaming attitudes. On this way of dividing up\nthings, the view put forth by Pamela Hieronymi (2004)\u2014which\nholds that the force of blame is located in judgments of ill\nwill\u2014would be categorized with that of R. Jay Wallace (1994,\n2011)\u2014which holds that blame is an emotional response to ill\nwill displayed in others\u2019 actions. Alternatively, we could categorize\ntheories of blame according to those psychological states or\ndispositions that are thought to constitute blame. This\nsecond way of dividing things up emphasizes an important difference\nbetween Hieronymi\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s theories: for Hieronymi, blame can\nbe identified primarily with a judgment, but for Wallace, blame is\nprimarily an emotion. A third way might instead focus on\nobjects of blaming attitudes and behaviors. Is blame directed\nexclusively at actions? Or can it instead be directed at attitudes,\nincluding beliefs, as in the case of epistemic blame (see, e.g.,\nRettler 2018)? Here a theory that emphasizes the significance of\nemotions might opt for a more circumscribed account, since it\u2019s not\nclear that indignation or other forms of blaming anger are really apt\nresponses to, say, culpable epistemic failures. By contrast, a theory\n(like Hieronymi\u2019s or Angela Smith\u2019s (2005)) that has a more\nminimal conception of blame can more easily account for blame for\nattitudes. \n\nOf course, any scheme for categorizing theories has its advantages and\ndisadvantages, and by selecting one scheme over the other, one\nnecessarily emphasizes certain aspects of blame while ignoring other\naspects of blame that might be equally important. Nevertheless, the taxonomy to follow is consonant with much of the literature in classifying theories according to the\nactivity or mental state that is thought to constitute blame. According to this way of\ncarving things up, we get four categories: cognitive, emotional,\nconative, and functional accounts of blame.\n",
