    "main_text": "Correspondence revisited || Representation and Correspondence\n3.2 Representation and Correspondence\n\nMuch of the subsequent discussion of Field-style approaches to\ncorrespondence has focused on the role of representation in these\nviews. Field\u2019s own (1972) discussion relies on a causal relation\nbetween terms and their referents, and a similar relation for\nsatisfaction. These are instances of representation relations.\nAccording to representational views, meaningful items, like perhaps\nthoughts or sentences or their constituents, have their contents in\nvirtue of standing in the right relation to the things they\nrepresent. On many views, including Field\u2019s, a name stands in\nsuch a relation to its bearer, and the relation is a causal one.\n\nThe project of developing a naturalist account of the representation\nrelation has been an important one in the philosophy of mind and\nlanguage. (See the entry on\n mental representation.)\n But, it has implications for the theory of truth. Representational\nviews of content lead naturally to correspondence theories of truth.\nTo make this vivid, suppose you hold that sentences or beliefs stand\nin a representation relation to some objects. It is natural to suppose\nthat for true beliefs or sentences, those objects would be facts. We\nthen have a correspondence theory, with the correspondence relation\nexplicated as a representation relation: a truth bearer is true if it\nrepresents a fact.\n\nAs we have discussed, many contemporary views reject facts, but one\ncan hold a representational view of content without them. One\ninterpretation of Field\u2019s theory is just that. The relations of\nreference and satisfaction are representation relations, and truth for\nsentences is determined compositionally in terms of those\nrepresentation relations, and the nature of the objects they\nrepresent. If we have such relations, we have the building blocks for\na correspondence theory without facts. Field (1972) anticipated a\nnaturalist reduction of the representation via a causal theory, but\nany view that accepts representation relations for truth bearers or\ntheir constituents can provide a similar theory of truth. (See Jackson\n(2006) and Lynch (2009) for further discussion.)\n\nRepresentational views of content provide a natural way to approach\nthe correspondence theory of truth, and likewise,\nanti-representational views provide a natural way to avoid the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. This is most clear in the work of\nDavidson, as we will discuss more in section 6.5.\n",
