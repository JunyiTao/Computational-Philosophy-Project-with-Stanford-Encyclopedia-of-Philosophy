Richard Feynman once came up with the idea that\nthe electron could go backwards in time as a possible interpretation\nof the positron (Feynman 1949). In fact he imagined the possibility\nthat perhaps there were only one electron in the world zig-zagging back\nand forth in time. An electron moving backwards in time would carry\nnegative energy whereas it would with respect to our ordinary time\nsense have positive charge and positive energy. But few consider this\nas a viable interpretation today (Earman 1967a, 1976).\n\nMore recently, the Bell type experiments have been interpreted by some\nas if quantum events could be connected in such a way that the past\nlight cone might be accessible under non-local interaction; not only\nin the sense of action at a distance but as backward causation. One of\nthe most enticing experiments of this kind is the Delayed Choice\nQuantum Eraser designed by Yoon-Ho Kim et al. (2000). It is a\nrather complicated construction. It is set up to measure correlated\npairs of photons, which are in an entangled state, so that one of the\ntwo photons is detected 8 nanoseconds before its partner. The results\nof the experiment are quite amazing. They seem to indicate that the\nbehavior of the photons detected these 8 nanoseconds before their\npartners is determined by how the partners will be detected. Indeed it\nmight be tempting to interpret these results as an example of the\nfuture causing the past. The result is, however, in accordance with\nthe predictions of quantum mechanics.\n\nHowever, David Ellerman (2015) argues that interpreting delayed-choice\nexperiments or similar experiments as revealing cases of backward\ncausation or retrocausation relies on what he calls the separation\nfallacy:\n\nWe have seen the same fallacy of interpretation in two-slit\nexperiments, which-way interferometer experiments, polarization\nanalyzers, and Stern-Gerlach experiments. The common element in all\nthe cases is that there is some separation apparatus that puts a\nparticle into a certain superposition of spatially\n\u201centangled\u201d or correlated eigenstates in such a manner\nthat when an appropriately spatially-positioned detector induces a\ncollapse to an eigenstate, then the detector will only register one of\nthe eigenstates. The separation fallacy is that this is misinterpreted\nas showing that the particle was already in that eigenstate in that\nposition as a result of the previous \u201cseparation.\u201d In fact\nthe superposition evolves until some distinction is made that\nconstitutes a measurement, and only then is the state reduced to an\neigenstate. The quantum erasers are more elaborate versions of these\nsimpler experiments, and a similar separation fallacy arises in that\ncontext.\n\n\nThus, Ellerman argues that when one describes a system in a\nsuperposition of certain eigenstates, it does not mean that the system\nis in any of these eigenstates before some measurement is carried out.\nTherefore, it is wrong to interpret delayed-choice experiments, and\ntheir like, as if the future measurement determines some past\neigenstates, which all were parts of a superposition.\n\nIn his discussion of the experimental violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities\nDon Howard (1989) distinguishes, based on an earlier work done by Jon\nJarrett, between locality and separability. The locality condition\nstates that a measurement of a pair of objects emerging from a singlet\nis statistically independent of the setting of the apparatus used to\nmeasure its counterpart. However, the separability condition is\ndefined as the joint probability is equal to the the product of the\nprobability of each state. We know that the experimental violation of\nBell\u2019s inequalities involves the invalidation of one of these\nconditions. Moreover, if we take Ellerman\u2019s argument into\nconsideration, the two entangled particles, although separated, are\nstill in a state of superposition until the measurement takes\nplace.\n\nIf we consider the notion of the entangled state in quantum mechanics,\nwe find that it is characterized as a unified, non-separable state due\nto the help of the notion of superposition of possible eigenstates\nrepresented by one common wave function for the correlated pair. Such\na superposition is neither distance-dependent nor time-dependent.\nTherefore it is not surprising that based on the correct predictions\nof quantum mechanics it is impossible to find support of the violation\nof normal causation within this kind of experiment. With reference to\nthe philosophical discussion about quantum mechanical entanglement, we\ncan conclude that the experimental results of this sort violate the\nprinciple of separability rather than the principle of locality.\n\nPhillippe Eberhard and Ronald R. Roos (1989) have established a\ntheorem which says that if quantum mechanics is correct, it is\nimpossible to use quantum effects to generate a break in the chain of\nnormal causation. Quantum field theory does not allow any superluminal\ncommunication between different observers. Indeed, this is not so\nstrange, since quantum field theory is relativistically invariant\nwhereas superluminal frames of reference are not. But Eberhard and\nRoos\u2019 theorem does not rule out all forms of backward causation.\nTwo possible scenarios are still open: (1) entangled pairs exchange\nsome form of superluminal information (and energy) below the limits of\nHeisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relations; or (2) causation may be\nsymmetrical so that the direction of causation in a physical system is\ndetermined by its boundary conditions.\n\nCosta de Beauregard (1977, 1979), for instance, has suggested that\nwhen a system of two photons in a singlet state is measured by two\nobservers in two regions separated by a space-like distance, then it\nis precisely the act of observation that produces the past of the\nmeasuring process in the sense that it influences the source that\nemitted the two photons. de Beauregard\u2019s idea is that the\nelement of reality being revealed in the formulation of the EPR\nparadox is real only because it was created by actually performed acts\nof observation that was propagated backwards in time with one of the\ntwo correlated quantum objects from the measuring device to the source\nof the photons.\n\nSome physicists, like Elitzur et al. (2016), suggest a form\nof too-late-choice experiment that supports such a time-symmetric\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics according to which backwards\ncausation plays a significant role. In the normal EPR experiment, each\nmeasurement determines, say, the spin value of two separated, say,\nelectrons in a singlet state along a certain orientation of the\napparatus. The outcome then proves that the spin value of one electron\nhas been affected by the distant experimenter\u2019s choice of spin\norientation of the other electron. However, what Elitzur et\nal. now imagine is a reversal setting in which a chosen spin\nvalue determines the corresponding orientation. Based on their\nanalysis, they conclude that \u201cit turns out that the orientation is\nsimilarly subject to nonlocal effects [as the spin value.]\u201d\n\nSeveral other philosophers and physicists have come forward with\nsimilar ideas. Aharonov and Vaidman (1997) have formulated a two\nvector approach to quantum mechanics \u201cin which a quantum system is\ndescribed, at a given time, by two (instead of one) quantum states:\nthe usual one evolving toward the future and the second evolving\nbackwards in time from a future measurement.\u201d Also Cramer\u2019s\ntransactional interpretation of quantum mechanics involves the idea of\na second wave travelling backwards in time (Cramer, 1986). The basic\nassumption behind all of them is that in the micro-world we find only\ncausal symmetry, and this fact together with proper boundary\nconditions can be used to give an explanation of outcomes that seem\notherwise paradoxical. Such quantum correlation experiments can,\nhowever, be interpreted in many other ways. In the end it seems as if\nit all depends one whether one assumes that Bell experiments break\nwith either the locality condition or the separability condition. A\ntime-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics is required only if\none believes that it is the locality condition that is violated in\norder to avoid being in conflict with relativity theory.\n",
