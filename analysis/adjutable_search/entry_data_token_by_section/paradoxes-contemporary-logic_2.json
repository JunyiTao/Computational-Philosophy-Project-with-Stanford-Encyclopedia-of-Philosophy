    "main_text": "Paradoxes: early developments (1897\u20131917) || Russell\u2019s contradiction\n2.2 Russell\u2019s contradiction\n\nThe second famous published antinomy (Russell 1903, paragraphs 78,\n101\u2013106; Frege 1903, Appendix, dated October 1902; see the entry\n Russell\u2019s paradox\n and Klement 2010) takes us from Cantor\u2019s paradise into the\nrealm of the foundations of logic and the philosophy of mathematics.\nIt is strikingly simple, involves only predicate application, and it\nhas an explicit self-referential (reflexive) character. In\nRussell\u2019s own words (June 16, 1902, letter to Frege, translation\nin van Heijenoort 1963, pp. 124\u2013125),\n\nlet \\(w\\) be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be\npredicated of itself. Can \\(w\\) be predicated of itself? From each\nanswer, the opposite follows. Likewise, there is no class (as a\ntotality) of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not\nbelong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain\ncircumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.\n\n\nRussell was at first entangled in the study of \u201cthe\ncontradictions in the relation of continuous quantity to number and\nthe continuum\u201d (cited in Moore 1995, p. 219), and he obtained\nhis contradiction (May 1901) as a result of considering the antinomy\narising with Cantor\u2019s theorem (see Russell 1903, footnote 7,\npar. 344; par. 100, p. 101). Russell probably realized the importance\nof the discovery only after Frege\u2019s reply. The effect of the\nantinomy is that it is impossible to have an abstraction operation\n\\(\\phi \\mapsto \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) mapping injectively any concept\n(property) \\(\\phi\\) into its extension (the class of all \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\phi(x))\\) (i.e., so that if the classes defined by \\(\\phi\\)\nand \\(\\psi\\) are equal, then \\(\\phi(a)\\leftrightarrow \\psi(a)\\), for\nevery object \\(a)\\). As a consequence, it is also impossible to lay\nout the foundations of set theory on a pure logical notion of\nset where membership faithfully mirrors predicate application, in\nthe sense that, in the light of Frege, \\(x \\in y\\) means that (1) \\(y\n= \\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) for some concept \\(\\phi\\), and (2) \\(\\phi\\)\ntruly applies to \\(x\\). (For historical details on Russell\u2019s\ndiscovery of the paradox, see Moore 1995).\n",
