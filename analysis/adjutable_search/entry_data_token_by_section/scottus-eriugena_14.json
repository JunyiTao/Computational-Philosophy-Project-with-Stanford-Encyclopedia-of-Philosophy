    "main_text": "The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon || Creation as Divine Self-Manifestation\n3.4 Creation as Divine Self-Manifestation\n\nEriugena conceives of the act of creation as a kind of\nself-manifestation wherein the hidden transcendent God creates himself\nby manifesting himself in divine outpourings or theophanies (I.446d).\nHe moves from darkness into the light, from self-ignorance into\nself-knowledge. The divine self-creation or self-manifestation\n(I.455b) is, at the same time (or rather timelessly), the expression\nof the Word (Logos) and hence the creation of all other things, since all\nthings are contained in the Word. The Word enfolds in itself the Ideas\nor Primary Causes of all things and in that sense all things are\nalways already in God:\n\n\n\u2026the Creative nature permits nothing outside itself because\noutside it nothing can be, yet everything which it has created and\ncreates it contains within itself, but in such a way that it itself is\nother, because it is superessential, than what it creates within\nitself. (Periphyseon, III.675c)\n\n\nGod\u2019s transcendent otherness above creatures is precisely that\nwhich allows creatures to be within God and yet other than God.\nEriugena stresses both the divine transcendence above and immanence in\ncreation. The immanence of God in the world is at the same time the\nimmanence of creatures within God. Creatures however, as fallen, do\nnot yet know that they reside in God. In cosmological terms, however,\nGod and the creature are one and the same:\n\n\nIt follows that we ought not to understand God and the creature as two\nthings distinct from one another, but as one and the same. For both\nthe creature, by subsisting, is in God; and God, by manifesting\nhimself, in a marvelous and ineffable manner creates himself in the\ncreature\u2026. (Periphyseon, III.678c)\n\n\nElsewhere Eriugena\u2019s asserts that God is the \u201cessence of\nall things\u201d (essentia omnium) and the \u201cform of\nall things\u201d (forma omnium). In the thirteenth century,\nexpressions such as these led to the accusation of heresy, i.e., that\nEriugena is collapsing the difference between God and creation. It\nmust be noted, however, that although Eriugena asserts the identity of\nGod and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the\n\u201cgenus\u201d or \u201cwhole\u201d (totum) of which\nthe creatures are \u201cspecies\u201d or \u201cparts\u201d. Only\nmetaphorically (metaforice, translative) can it be\nsaid that God is a \u201cgenus\u201d or a \u201cwhole\u201d.\nAssertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always\nbalanced in Eriugena\u2019s writings by assertions of God\u2019s\ntranscendence above all things. God is both \u201cform of all\nthings\u201d and also is without form, formless. Since God cannot be\nsaid to be anything, God cannot be simply identified with any or every\ncreature either.\n",
