    "main_text": "Art as Craft, Magic, Representation and Amusement || Art as Magic\n1.3 Art as Magic\n\nCollingwood takes pains to analyze the notion of magic because\nproperly understood, magic is much more closely intertwined with art\nproper than one would have thought; nevertheless, it too falls prey to\nthe master argument: it is a kind of craft, and art is not craft.\n\nMagic is not, contra the prevailing anthropology of the time, mere bad\nscience\u2014\u2018superstitious\u2019 false beliefs like that of\nnot walking under ladders because of the evil that will surely follow.\nNor is it explicable as Freudian neurosis, which assumes that every\nsociety employing magical practices is to that extent sick. Magic is\nthe ritualized representation of useful emotion, not for the sake of\ncatharsis, but for the practical value of the emotion. The war-dance,\nfor example, instills courage by dint of drums and spears, and\nfrightens the enemy should he catch a glimpse. Of course false beliefs\nmay play a role, which the theory of magic-as-bad-science seizes upon;\nthe rain dancer may think he increases the probability of rain. But\nthat is a \u2018perversion\u2019 of magic; the true magical effect\nis the reinforcement of hope and hard work that a drought puts to the\ntest. The Freudian theory regards the representation as omnipotent\nwish-fulfilment and therefore fails to account for this latter effect,\nwhich indeed Collingwood supposes to be vital to any healthy society.\nHappily, our society, or our societies, are replete with magical\nphenomena. Religion, patriotism, sport, social customs such as dinner\nparties, weddings, funerals, dances, and so on all involve in one way\nor another ritualized actions that are undertaken at least partly for\nmagical reasons. (Of course magical phenomena are probably on the\nwane.)\n\nArt proper is often bound up with magical \u2018art\u2019, and\nindeed it is common amongst critics to confuse them. Religious\nart\u2014say a twelfth-century crucifix\u2014may be aesthetically\nfine as well as induce a pious awe in the mind of the believer. But\nthe fact that a suitably kitschy product may also serve the latter\npurpose shows that the magical effect can be aimed at independently\nfrom the aesthetic (admittedly, Collingwood underestimates the problem\nof disentangling these purportedly different responses\u2014for some\npeople, only an aesthetically fine thing can generate strong pious\nemotions; perhaps Collingwood can allow that some art proper may be\ninstrumentally necessary for the achievement of magical ends).\nFrequently, the particular form of this mistake is to think that an\nattitude towards the subject-matter embodied in a work is rightly\ntaken as the object of purely aesthetic criticism. Thus it is common\nto hear for example of a play praised for taking a salutary view of\nsexual politics and would therefore encourage the sexes to get on\nbetter; to say so is to say that the play is very good at what\nCollingwood is calling \u2018magic\u2019, but is neither here nor\nthere as regards its status as art.\n1.4 Art as Amusement\n\nThe aim of amusement art is to stimulate an emotion by \u2018make\nbelieve\u2019 means, and to discharge it. If the emotion is intended\nto remain undischarged\u2014if the aim is that the audience should\nleave the theatre indignant at global warming for example\u2014then\nthe work is one of magic; if the emotions it evokes are intended to be\n\u2018earthed\u2019, the work is one of amusement. Most of\nliterature and drama are actually amusement\u2014not only for example\nThackeray but most of Shakespeare are included. But remember that\namusement and art proper can co-exist, i.e., in the same work (in\nShakespeare\u2019s case, the same work is often actually a bundle of\nworks, some magical, some amusement, and some, at least in favourable\ncases, of art proper). Collingwood stresses\u2014in 1938\u2014the\nrise of decadent amusement works, especially pornography but also for\nexample the case of literature or film appealing to our love of\nimaginatively dwelling amongst the upper classes. And he warns of a\ndanger they present to our society (or rather of the danger of the\nconditions that give rise to an ever growing demand for them); that is\nwhat Plato meant to proscribe in his famous banishment of the\n\u2018artist\u2019 from his republic, and Collingwood sees Plato as\nhaving foretold the eventual doom of Greco-Roman civilisation. Now all\nthis is by the way; amusement is craft, not art. But the points he\nraises in this connection are important to his main subject, because a\ncertain tradition wrongly identifies the success-conditions of arts of\namusement as the standard of taste for art proper. Hume, for example,\nwrote as if the criterion for success in a work of art is the\nexcitation of pleasure in suitably refined individuals. But pleasure\nhas a name; the \u2018artist\u2019 who busies himself with arousing\nthat particular emotion is merely a craftsman.\n2. Art as Expression\n\nIf art proper is not the stimulation of preconceived emotion, and not\nthe representation of it either, then what precisely does it mean to\nsay that, nevertheless, art is the expression of emotion? The key is\nto remember that art is not craft\u2014Collingwood assumes that the\nreader will accept this, once it is pointed out\u2014and hence the\ndistinction between means and ends does not, strictly speaking, apply.\nNor does the distinction between planning and execution. Instead,\nCollingwood writes in a passage that is often quoted, when a person\nexpresses an emotion, he is\n\nconscious of \u2026 a perturbation or excitement which he feels\ngoing on within him, but of whose nature he is ignorant. While in this\nstate, all he can say about his emotion is: \u2018I feel \u2026 I\ndon\u2019t know what I feel.\u2019 From this helpless and oppressed\ncondition he extricates himself by doing something which we call\nexpressing himself. This is an activity which has something to do with\nthe thing we call language: he expresses himself by speaking. It also\nsomething to do with consciousness: the emotion expressed is an\nemotion of whose nature the person who feels it is no longer\nunconscious. It also has something to do with the way in which he\nfeels the emotion. As unexpressed, he feels it in what we called a\nhelpless and oppressed way; as expressed, he feels in a way from which\nthis sense of oppression has vanished. His mind is somehow lightened\nand eased (109\u201310).\n\n\nThe following three points emerge from this. 1. To express is to\nbecome conscious of an emotion: that is why the distinction\nbetween plan and execution cannot be applied. 2. Expression\nindividualises; rather than describing the emotion in words\nwhose signification is in principle general, the expression is a\nintrinsic feature of the utterance, of the \u2018utterance\nitself\u2019 (although he does not credit him, this is an evident\nexample where Collingwood follows Croce). Thus we cannot speak of the\nemotion embodied in a work of art as if it were the content which the\nart provides the form. 3. The \u2018lightening\u2019 of which\nCollingwood speaks is not that of catharsis, which provides an outlet\nfor the emotion and may take place without its agents being conscious\nof it at all. It is the achievement of clarity, of focus of mind,\nwhich may indeed intensify what is felt rather than attenuate it\n(though typically it does not).\n\nThis last point suggests that there is such a thing as an\n\u2018aesthetic emotion\u2019, but it \u2018is not a specific kind\nof emotion pre-existing to the expression of it\u2019 (117). Instead,\nit is an \u2018emotional colouring which attends the expression of\nany emotion whatever\u2019 (ibid.) Expression, in this\nsense, must be sharply distinguished from the betrayal of emotion;\none\u2019s tears may be said to \u2018express\u2019 one\u2019s\nsadness, or stamping one\u2019s feet ones anger, but these can occur\nwithout the making lucid and intelligible of the emotion that is\nrequisite for expression in Collingwood\u2019s sense. Betrayal can\neven occur that is wholly unconscious; one can blush without noticing\nit. The relation between expressive object and emotion is that of\nembodiment or realization, not of inference.\n3. Art as Imaginative Creation\n\nTo conceive art as the craft of emotional stimulation or\narousal\u2014whether for the sake of amusement or magic\u2014is to\nregard the material work of art as the intended means towards a\npreconceived end. The falsity of that conception\u2014assuming that\nart is essentially the expression of emotion\u2014shows that the work\nof art as not an artifact at all (so artworks are not\nartifacts; Collingwood was aware that language sometimes suggests\ntheoretical mistakes). Instead, the artistic process is a specialized\ntype of making that Collingwood calls creation: to create\nsomething is to make it non-technically, but \u2018consciously and\nvoluntarily\u2019 (128), and hence intentionally. The creator\n\u2018need not be acting in order to achieve any ulterior end; he not\nbe following a preconceived plan; and he is certainly not transforming\nanything that can be properly be called a raw material\u2019\n(129).\n\nNow take for example a lecture given on a scientific topic. There are,\nin Collingwood\u2019s view, actually at least two things: The lecture\nas a created thing, and the lecture as a particular sound-event. The\nformer may be complete in advance of, or indeed without ever, being\nuttered or written down: the actual speech-event, as a sequence of\nnoise, enables a suitably equipped listener to reconstruct the created\nthing is his own mind, therefore to grasp its scientific content, but\nis inessential to it. And so it is with works of art. A tune, for\nexample, needn\u2019t be sung, played or written down in order to\nexist. Thus Collingwood:\n\nI have already said that a thing which \u2018exists in a\nperson\u2019s head\u2019 and nowhere else is alternatively called an\nimaginary thing. The actual making of the tune is therefore\nalternatively called the making of an imaginary tune. This is a case\nof creation \u2026 Hence the making a tune is an instance of\nimaginative creation. The same applies to the making of a poem, or a\npicture, or any other work of art. (134)\n\n\nCollingwood is not supposing that every work of art could in point of\nfact exist only people\u2019s minds; of music, for example, he writes\n\u2018[P]erhaps no one can do that [possess himself of the music]\nunless he does hear the noises\u2019 (140; of course there are some\nprima facie counterexamples to this; later Beethoven, for\nexample). The human imagination is typically too weak; in most cases\nwe have to depend on the \u2018bodily\u2019 work of art for sensory\nhelps. But in principle, the \u2018total imaginative\nexperience\u2019 that constitutes the proper work of art must be\nconceived as only contingently related to the bodily work.\n\nWhat precisely is the motivation for this move, the conception of the\nwork of art as imagined or ideal object? Leave aside the special cases\nof music and poetry, which Richard Wollheim notes have the special\nfeature that they can be written down (see Wollheim 1972). Why not\nconceive painting, for example, as the creation of certain painted\nobjects? This would be consistent with the thesis that painting is a\nnot craft. The answer given by Collingwood is clear, but leads to\ntrouble when we consider the question of interpretation. An experience\nof a painting involves a great deal that no one would say is \u2018in\nthe painting\u2019, which is, after all, a nearly flat canvas with\npaint on it. Not only do we see things that are not really present,\nbut for example we have impressions of space and mass, perhaps by\nmeans of what Berenson called \u2018ideated\nsensations\u2019\u2014those which involve imaginary motor or\nkinaesthetic sensations. These phenomena are not literally features of\nthe canvas, but they are in some sense features of the work. So\nCollingwood, in brief, includes within the work of art proper all that\nwould normally be ascribed to the (correct) interpretation\u2014the\n(correct) experience\u2014of the artwork. But there is no reason to\naccept this, any more we should include all the relational\nfacts\u2014sowing, fertilization, watering and so on\u2014that\ncontribute to a growing plant to the plant itself. On contrary, the\nposition makes it impossible for two spectators to disagree on the\ninterpretation of a work. Irrespective of the concern with the privacy\nof the experience, if they attribute different properties to the\nobject\u2014that is, they find different properties in their\nrespective total imaginative experiences\u2014they are simply\nconcerned with different objects, and their verdicts are compatible.\nWe could set the artist\u2019s own experience as a criterion of\nunderstanding the work, but that would make his death significant in\nway that we do not actually recognize, and would run against the grain\nof Collingwood\u2019s antipathy to aesthetic individualism and the\n\u2018cult of genius\u2019, discussed below. As a matter of\nspeculation, Collingwood perhaps thought that aesthetically relevant\nproperties\u2014expressive properties\u2014have to be intrinsic\nproperties of the work of art; in that case, perhaps his conclusion\ndoes follow. But it is much more satisfactory to hold that what we are\narguing over when we disagree over the expressive properties of a work\nof art is the same object.\n4. A Theory of Expressive Imagination\n\nNot a great deal hangs on that thesis, at any rate. A great deal more\nhangs on the thesis that art essentially exercises the expressive\nimagination. The difference between the imagined lecture and the tune\nis that the content of the lecture is verbal and cognitive, and brings\nthose departments of mind into play; whilst the tune, among other\nthings, brings the emotional department of the mind much more vividly\ninto play. The substance of Collingwood\u2019s view is largely\ndependent on his account of this distinction.\n\nAt the most basic level Collingwood distinguishes thinking from\nfeeling. The objects of each, respectively, are thoughts and\n\u2018sensa\u2019: \u2018sensa\u2019 is Collingwood\u2019s name\nfor all the data of the senses\u2014of touch, smell, sight, and so\non. Thoughts can be true or false, justified or not, where sensa have\nno such duality: they are felt or not felt, but cannot contradict each\nother. There is sense in which sensa can be said to be real or unreal,\ntrue or false (for example in hallucination), but this not an\nintrinsic feature of sensa themselves; that distinction applies only\nto thoughts involving them. A first point that is directly relevant to\nthe theory of expression is that probably all sensa have an emotional\n\u2018charge\u2019. Thus for example every colour carries with it a\ncertain emotional quality. Not that they are invariably experienced\nwith their particular emotional charge; the charge is more like a\ndisposition to be experienced a certain way, under certain\ncircumstances. Children or artists are more likely to experience them;\neducated adult Europeans, Collingwood says, tend to have rather\n\u2018sterilized\u2019 experience.\n\nSensa are occurrent phenomena, and therefore fleeting (222): If I hear\nthe bell striking the hour of four, the experience comprises many\npassing sensa, each no sooner generated than gone. But if I am to be\naware of them as a process extended in time with particular\nmorphology, I must retain the sound of the bell, along with the\nsilences in between. The objects that I so retain cannot be the sensa\nthemselves. Instead, the faculty of \u2018conscious attention\u2019\ngenerates \u2018ideas\u2019 corresponding to the sensa, and which\nare retained. Sensa alone\u2014or sense data, or\nimpressions\u2014are never sufficient for consciousness. Collingwood\ncites Kant approvingly in the connection; noting that we have always\nto \u2018fill in\u2019 occurrent perception to generate a complete\nworld of 3-D objects, he writes:\n\nMoreover (this is a point Kant has made), it is only so far as I\nimagine them that I am aware of the matchbook as a solid body at all.\nA person who could really see, but could not imagine, would see not a\nsolid world of bodies of bodies, but merely (as Berkeley has it)\n\u2018various colours variously disposed\u2019. Thus, as Kant says,\nimagination is an \u2018indispensable function\u2019 for our\nknowledge of the world around us. (192)\n\n\nWhen one is conscious of a feeling of anger, one is aware of it as\none\u2019s own. By becoming conscious of it\u2014therefore not of\nthe sensation of anger but the anger transformed by\nconsciousness\u2014what we feel \u2018is correspondingly\nchanged\u2019 (207); the \u2018effect of this experience \u2026 is\nmake them less violent\u2019 (209). And another word for this is\nimagination. \u2018We become able to perpetuate feeling \u2026 at\nwill\u2019 (209). \u2018Imagination is thus the new form which\nfeeling takes when transformed by the activity of consciousness\u2019\n(215). With this level of consciousness comes the beginning of\nself-consciousness; \u2018it is assertion of ourselves as the owners\nof our feeling\u2019 (222; feeling that is \u2018as modified by\nconsciousness\u2019). But imagination, since it deals not with sensa\nbut with their ideated analogues, is a type of thought, and with the\nintroduction of thought comes the possibility of error. Thus if the\nbasic action of the consciousness is to think \u2018This is how I\nfeel\u2019, its denial is \u2018This is not how I feel\u2019 (216).\nThe possibility of such disowned feeling is the possibility of false,\nor corrupt consciousness (217).\n\nThought is established by the intellect, but there are two, separable\nroles of thought called \u2018primary\u2019 and\n\u2018secondary\u2019. Its primary role is to \u2018apprehend or\nconstruct relations\u2019 (216) amongst ideas, as just described (in\nfact Collingwood thinks in such relations the relata are fused in a\nnew idea comprising a \u2018peculiar colouring or modification of the\nold\u2019 (223)). The secondary role is to apprehend or construct\n\u2018relations between acts of primary intellection\u2019; by this\nCollingwood means conceptions of the past, future, the possible etc.,\nand presumably all that content of human thought which can not be\naccounted for in terms of the imagination.\n5. Language\n\nThat Collingwood has a theory of language might seem tangential to his\ntheory of art, but in fact it is integral to it. For\nCollingwood\u2019s approach to it comes not from the theory of\nreference and truth as in Frege or Russell, but from the point of view\nwhich regards language as fundamentally or in the first instance\nexpressive behaviour. Concepts of referential semantics\u2014as a\n\u2018symbolism\u2019 in Collingwood\u2019s\nterminology\u2014become applicable only later, with a certain degree\nof sophistication is attained. \u2018In its original or native state,\nlanguage in imaginative or expressive \u2026 It is imaginative\nactivity whose function is to express emotion.\u2019 (225). Of course\n\u2018imaginative\u2019 must be understood in the broader sense just\ndescribed, denoting all consciousness of ideated analogues of\nsensation or feeling. From this angle, we can speak of the\n\u2018totality of our motor activities\u2019 as a \u2018parent\norganism\u2019 (247), from which every type of \u2018language\n(speech, gesture, and so forth)\u2019 is an \u2018offshoot\u2019\n(246).\n\nAt the most fundamental level, at the \u2018psychic\u2019 level as\nCollingwood calls it, various sorts of bodily activity are said to\npsychically express an underlying emotional charge on a sensum;\ncringing or flinching express fear, for example. At this stage\nconsciousness of the imagination is not involved\u2014only sensa;\nthis level is shared with animals, and is \u2018completely\nuncontrollable\u2019 (234). With the consciousness of ideas comes\n\u2018emotions of consciousness\u2019, which require language for\ntheir expression. A cry from a child, for example, may be either\npsychic or imaginative, depending whether it is involuntary or\nvoluntary. If it is voluntary, it is the work of the conscious\nimagination, and thus in the most rudimentary sense linguistic.\n\nIt is essential to Collingwood\u2019s view that there are not,\nparadoxical as it sounds, any unexpressed emotions. A psychical\nemotion, on one hand, simply has its being in its expression; an\nemotion of fear must show up somewhere, whether by cringing, shying or\nflinching, an increase in pulse or blood pressure, a tightness of the\nchest, or something else bodily or physiological. On the other hand,\nif someone tries but fails to express an emotion, the emotion at most\nremains \u2018shut up\u2019 in the psychic level; in order to be\nconscious of the emotion, \u2018the same consciousness which\ngenerates these emotions converts them from impressions into ideas\ngenerates also and simultaneously their appropriate linguistic\nexpression.\u2019(238). There is no other way to be conscious of an\nemotion; to express an emotion is to be conscious of it.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s remarks about the relation between speaker and\nhearer are of special interest not just to aestheticians but to\nphilosophers of mind interested in knowledge of other minds. A\nvoluntary cry is underpinned by a self-conscious imaginative act; and\nhowever rudimentary it is, self-consciousness is at once the\nconsciousness of others. \u2018[A]s persons\u2019, writes\nCollingwood, \u2018they construct a new set of relations between\nthemselves, arising out their consciousness of themselves and one\nanother; these are linguistic relations.\u2019 (248).\n\nThe relation of the listener and speaker to an expressive act is\ntotally symmetric:\n\nThe hearer, therefore, conscious that he is being addressed by another\nperson like himself \u2026 takes what he hears exactly as if it were\nspeech of his own: he speaks to himself with the words that he hears\naddressed to him, and thus constructs in himself the idea which those\nwords express. At the same time, being conscious of the speaker as a\nperson other than himself, he attributes that idea to this other\nperson. Understanding what some one says to you is thus attributing to\nhim the idea which his words arouse in yourself; and this implies\ntreating them as words of your own. (250).\n\n\nRemember, again, that we are talking of the expressive\ndimension of language, not the referential dimension (about which more\nin a moment). To understand another person\u2019s emotions is\nprecisely to adopt the person\u2019s expressive language as\none\u2019s own, imaginatively experiencing the ideas as if they were\none\u2019s own (that is, as if they expressed one\u2019s own\nemotion; of course the ideas, as analogues of sensation, are\nnecessarily one\u2019s own). This aspect of Collingwood, of the\nnecessary publicity of language and meaning, can be stressed as a\npotential way out of the threat of the seeming privacy of the work of\nart as mentioned above, in connection with p. 134 of the\nPrinciples.\n\nThere is however one evident mistake in Collingwood\u2019s\npresentation. Sensa are, as we\u2019ve seen, fleeting. But no idea\n\u2018can be formed as such in consciousness except by a mind whose\nsense-emotional experience contains the corresponding impression\n\u2026 at that very moment.\u2019 (251). This cannot be right. To\nunderstand Othello, we don\u2019t have to actually have an impression\nof jealousy; we only need to have the idea. In fact, by what we said\nin section IV, there are no impressions (sensa) of jealousy at all;\njealousy is an emotion of consciousness. The solution, which as far as\nI can see is consistent with everything else Collingwood says, is\nsimply to erase the requirement that the listener must undergo\nanything at the psychical level, the level of sensa, coevally\nwith expression (we leave open the question of whether it must have\nhappened to one in the past).\n\nEarlier, we said that thought involving relations is the domain of\nthought in its \u2018secondary\u2019 role, the realm of intellect.\nThoughts delivered by the imagination are \u2018seamless\u2019:\n\nThus what I imagine, however complex it may be, is imagined as a\nsingle whole, where relation between the part are present simply as\nqualities of the whole.\n\n\n\u2018Analytical thought\u2019\u2014intellect, thought in its\nsecondary role\u2014may begin with the same experience, but instead\nof being \u2018an indivisible unity it becomes a manifold, a network\nof things with relations between them\u2019 (253). Collingwood also\ncharacterises the intellect as the domain of concepts, and of\ngeneralisation (273, 281).\n\nNow one might be tempted to suppose that thoughts as grasped by the\nintellect are roughly the same as propositions, in the sense intended\nby analytical philosophers. But Collingwood holds that the proposition\nis \u2018a fictitious entity\u2019 (266), and devotes a long passage\nto excoriating that tendency in philosophy. Every actual episode of\nthought is performed with its own particular degree and character of\nemotion; there is no such thing as the thought shorn of its emotional\nhusk. All mental activity has some emotional character, including\nintellectual activity. The cry of \u2018Eureka\u2019 said to have\naccompanied Archimedes\u2019 discovery of a principle of hydrostatics\nis but an extreme example. Thus language is expressive of\nemotion even in its scientific use. This applies even to mathematical\nsymbols and technical symbols. Insofar as they are used, they\nautomatically acquire the expressive character of the underlying\nthoughts. Thus Collingwood says: \u2018Symbolism is thus intellectual\nlanguage; language, because it expresses emotions; intellectualized,\nbecause adapted to the expression of intellectual emotions\u2019\n(269). In \u2018poeticizing\u2019 such language, Collingwood does\nnot intend to demean it; presumably the aim is to do justice to the\nrarefied air of pure intellect:\n\nThe progressive intellectualization of language, its progressive\nconversion by the word of grammar and logic into a scientific\nsymbolism, thus represents not a progressive drying-up of emotions,\nbut its progressive articulation and specialization. We are not\ngetting away from an emotional atmosphere into a dry, rational\natmosphere; we are acquiring new emotions and new means of expressing\nthem. (269)\n\n\nNevertheless, Collingwood\u2019s account of language, needless to\nsay, is radical; he is quite serious in his denial of the possibility\nof what earlier I called a theory of the purely referential dimension\nof language, which generalizes about truth-conditions of sentences in\nabstraction from their use:\n\n\u2026 we are concerned with a modification of language, not a\ntheory of it. Its assumptions are neither certainly nor probably, nor\never possibly, true. They are, in fact, not assumptions, but\nproposals; and what they propose is the conversion of language into\nsomething which, if it could be realized, would not be language at\nall. (262)\n\n6. Practical Consequences: Art and Artists\n\nWith his theory of language in place, Collingwood takes the theory of\nart to be complete. At the end of section III we said that Collingwood\ndefines Art as imaginative expression, assuming that readers will\nagree once they have the mistakes of the technical or craft theory\npointed out for them. He then poses a particular theory of mind in\nwhich imagination and expression are built into the structural fabric\nof the mind, so that every intentional mental act is in some sense an\nact of an expressive imagination. That includes linguistic acts. In\nfact, properly understood, language encompasses all expressive acts\nwhatsoever, and every linguistic act is one way or another an\nexpressive act. Language and art become interchangeable (274).\n\u2018Every utterance\u2019, Collingwood says, \u2018and every\ngesture that each one of us makes is a work of art\u2019 (285).\nCollingwood next turns to \u2018practical\u2019 questions, of which\nwe will consider two: the relation of art to artists, and relation\nbetween the artist and the community. In answering them, we will\nconsider some questions naturally arising from the preceding.\n\nIf all activity is in that sense \u2018artistic\u2019, then it is\nnatural to wonder whether the theory has anything to tell us about\nart, that is, the peculiar business of the painter, the poet,\nthe musician and the like. Of course, most activity is undertaken with\na some purpose in mind or other, in which case it is craft, however\nhum-drum the theory of it might be. For example, I just ate an orange\nwhich I took from a bowl; the theory of what I did could be written\ndown in a practical guide to eating oranges. But surely I was\nconscious of eating the orange; by Collingwood\u2019s\ntheory, then, was I not expressing something? In that case, by the\nsame theory, just by being conscious, was I not engaged in art? And is\nthat not absurd?\n\nCollingwood says nothing in direct reply to this worry, but I think it\nobvious that the reply would be this. In so far as I was conscious of\nthe orange, it is true that I was involved in expression. But this\nconscious experience was un-sustained, fleeting, and lacking in depth\n(307). Furthermore, it took place in a mind that was busy with other\nthings, and which was dominated by an overarching purpose, namely to\neat the orange, whose sub-tasks include selecting it, peeling it,\nputting a section in my mouth, trying not spill too much juice, and so\non; all this would be written down in my practical guide to eating\noranges. Life, then, is full of \u2018artworks\u2019, but they are\nmostly shallow, unworthy of comment. However, there are times when\nconsciousness settles on something, such that the mental activity does\napproach the character of art, in the proper sense of the word.\nSitting in a park, for example, we might dwell on the look of an oak\ntree, or suddenly think of an original stanza of poetry, or a snatch\nof melody. These are instances of imaginative expression, and are\ncloser to what we should ordinarily call a work of art. But they are\nlikely to be lost, unless some record of the experience is made. The\n\u2018artist\u2019, then, is one who has these experiences of\nconsciousness more deeply than the average person, and who has\nmastered the practice of preserving them.\n\nBut the act of \u2018preserving them\u2019 has to be understood in a\nspecial sense. \u2018There is no question\u2019, says Collingwood,\n\u201cof \u2018externalizing\u2019 an inward experience which is\ncomplete in itself and by itself\u201d (304). Collingwood is denying\nthat a painter could in point of fact dispense with the medium, even\nif in principle he could (in sense of \u2018could in principle\u2019\nin which a man might run a hundred miles per hour). Instead, although\n\u2018you see something in your subject, of course, before you begin\nto paint it\u2019 (303), the \u2018experience develops itself and\ndefines itself in your mind as you paint\u2019 (ibid.). The\nwork of art develops by means of positive feedback between painting\nand experience. What develops is the \u2018total imaginative\nexperience\u2019 that Collingwood identifies as the work of art,\nstrictly speaking (304). Again, the work of art proper is not to be\nidentified with the \u2018bodily work\u2019\u2014the painted\ncanvas, the sculpted bust\u2014but with the experience of it. What is\ntrue that in point of fact the imaginative experiences requires the\nbodily work; the human imagination is not able to hold within it\nanything approaching the richness made available by the plastic arts.\nIn particular, the \u2018outward element\u2019\u2014the bodily\nwork\u2014provides the sensuous content or impressions out of which\nthe conscious imagination generates ideas, constituting the\n\u2018total imaginative experience\u2019 (see Davies 2008 for more\non this issue).\n7. Practical Consequences: The Artist and the Community\n\n\u2018Theoretically\u2019, Collingwood says, \u2018the artist is a\nperson who comes to know himself, to know his own emotion\u2019\n(291). Despite this, however, Collingwood is anxious to show this does\nnot entail aesthetic solipsism, as if the artist need not ever concern\nhimself with others. Quite the opposite: necessarily the artistic\nachievement is collaborative, involving the audience and other\nartists.\n\nCollingwood begins his account of the relation between artist and\nspectator by saying that a spectator understands a given work just\ninsofar as his imaginative experience is identical with that had by\nthe artist in creating it. This can never be known with certainty, but\nso it is with all understanding of language (remember that\n\u2018language\u2019 in Collingwood\u2019s usage means all\nexpressive behaviour). It is also piecemeal: \u2018Understanding\n\u2026 is a complex business, consisting of many phases, each\ncomplete in itself but each leading on to the next\u2019 (311).\nCollingwood does speak of identity of understanding, but\nreally his real account is more fluid. First, he accepts that any\nutterance is endlessly interpretable; there no such thing as\n\u2018the\u2019 meaning of a work (ibid.). Second, the\naudience\u2019s role is collaborative, in the sense that the artist\nis concerned to express emotions that are mutually held; failure in\nthis may rightly cause the artist to doubt whether he expressed\nanything, and suffers instead from a \u2018corruption of\nconsciousness\u2019 as explained earlier. The audience, then,\nactively participates in re-creating the imaginative experience. This\nsecond point flows from his conception of art as a language:\n\nThe child learning his mother tongue, as we have seen, learns\nsimultaneously to be a speaker and to be a listener; he listens to\nothers speaking, and speaks to others listening. It is the same with\nartists. They become poets or painters or musicians not by some\nprocess of development from within, as they grow beards; but by living\nin a society where these languages are current. Like other speakers,\nthey speak to those who understand.\n (317)[1]\n\n\nCollingwood further dilutes the air of aesthetic solipsism by\nobserving that the artist never works alone; on the one hand the\nartist freely borrows from what has already been achieved, and on the\nother, at least in the performing arts, the players have their own\nessential role. A work of art is collaborative, not simply the\ncreation of an individual; the \u2018cult of individual genius\u2019\nis totally misplaced and indeed pernicious.\n8. Problems\n\nCollingwood\u2019s theory is generally lumped together with that of\nBenedetto Croce as an expressive and idealist theory. There are of\ncourse differences, but the established picture is not inaccurate. And\ntogether with Croce\u2019s theory, Collingwood\u2019s has a fatal\ndefect (without questioning the starting-point, that the essence of\nart to be expressive): In identifying the artwork with what we would\nnormally think of as the experience of the artwork, he makes nonsense\nof the idea that the spectator interprets the artwork, and\ncan do so more or less accurately; that different people can argue\nabout the self-same work of art. It has become a truism that the\nartist is no better placed than the audience to interpret a work\nrightly, a truism that Collingwood, with his fulminations again\naesthetic individualism, would agree. But then the various imaginative\nexperiences have nothing to conform to, if artwork and experience and\nhence artwork and interpretation cannot be separated. That would be\nfatal to the theory; however, it is not clear that anything\nsubstantial would be lost, if Collingwood were simply to identify the\nwork of art with the \u2018bodily work\u2019, thereby\nre-establishing room for interpretation to operate. This would seem to\nsit better with his idea that art is on a level with language, where\nlanguage is a public phenomenon.\n\nAn apparent further defect in Collingwood\u2019s case in particular\nis his account of language. It is full of admirable insights, but it\nis probably misconceived from back to front. The insistence that\nlanguage is always expressive is dogmatic, and leads Collingwood to\ndeny that there is any categorical distinction between poetry and\nscientific writing, which many may take as a reductio ad\nabsurdum (298). And more seriously so far as his philosophy of\nart is concerned, one might wonder about his account of consciousness\nas tied to language. According to it\u2014the theory of\nimagination\u2014merely to attend to something is thereby to\nexpress it, and furthermore is to do something\nlinguistic. Even if we allow Collingwood his generalised\nnotion of language as appertaining to gesture and so on, surely there\nhas to be a separation between consciousness or attention and\nexpression. As C. J. Ducasse pointed out, it seems that when we look\nat a vase full of flowers, do we not create a \u201cwork of\nart\u201d unless we draw or paint it (Ducasse 1929, 52\u201354).\n\nFinally, it is hard to swallow whole Collingwood\u2019s distinction\nbetween art and craft. The consequences are too severe. For example,\nCollingwood, rigorously applying the distinction, says that insofar as\nhis activity is art in the proper sense, an artist, since he has no\nidea what he is to express until he expresses it, cannot set out to\nwrite, say, a tragedy\n (116).[2]\n There is something right in the idea that that the artist cannot\n\u2018plan and execute\u2019 an inspiration. But the distinction\nCollingwood is after is surely not so cut and dried as that. He needs\nat any rate a more selective weapon to attack his bugbear of amusement\nart.",
