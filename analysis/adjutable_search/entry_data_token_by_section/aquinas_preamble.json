    "main_text": "\n\nBetween antiquity and modernity stands Thomas Aquinas (ca.\n1225\u20131274). The greatest figure of thirteenth-century Europe in\nthe two preeminent sciences of the era, philosophy and theology, he\nepitomizes the scholastic method of the newly founded universities.\nLike\n Dante\n or Michelangelo, Aquinas takes inspiration from antiquity, especially\n Aristotle,\n and builds something entirely new. Viewed through a theological lens,\nAquinas has often been seen as the summit of the Christian tradition\nthat runs back to\n Augustine\n and the early Church. Viewed as a philosopher, he is a foundational\nfigure of modern thought. His efforts at a systematic reworking of\nAristotelianism reshaped Western philosophy and provoked countless\nelaborations and disputations among later medieval and modern\nphilosophers.\n",
