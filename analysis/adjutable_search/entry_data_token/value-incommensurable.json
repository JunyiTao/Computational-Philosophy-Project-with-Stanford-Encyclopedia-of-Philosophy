Value Incommensurability \n\nIncommensurability between values must be distinguished from the kind\nof incommensurability associated with Paul Feyerabend (1978, 1981,\n1993) and Thomas Kuhn (1977, 1983, 1996) in epistemology and the\nphilosophy of science. Feyerabend and Kuhn were concerned with\nincommensurability between rival theories or paradigms \u2014 that\nis, the inability to express or comprehend one conceptual scheme, such\nas Aristotelian physics, in terms of another, such as Newtonian\nphysics.\n\nIn contrast, contemporary inquiry into value incommensurability\nconcerns comparisons among abstract values (such as liberty or\nequality) or particular bearers of value (such as a certain\ninstitution or its effects on liberty or equality). The term\n\u201cbearer of value\u201d is to be understood broadly. Bearers of\nvalue can be objects of potential choice (such as a career) or states\nof affairs that cannot be chosen (such as a beautiful sunset). Such\nbearers of value are valuable in virtue of the abstract value or\nvalues they instantiate or display (so, for example, an institution\nmight be valuable in virtue of the liberty or equality that it\nengenders or embodies).\n1.1 Measurement and Comparison \n\nThe term \u201cincommensurable\u201d suggests the lack of a common\nmeasure. This idea has its historical roots in mathematics. For the\nancient Greeks, who had not recognized irrational numbers, the\ndimensions of certain mathematical objects were found to lack a common\nunit of measurement. Consider the side and the diagonal of a unit\nsquare. These can be compared or ranked ordinally, since the diagonal\nis longer. However, without the use of irrational numbers, there is no\nway to specify with cardinal numbers exactly how much longer the\ndiagonal is than the side of a unit square. The significance of this\nkind of incommensurability, especially for the Pythagoreans, is a\nmatter of some debate (Burkert 1972, 455\u2013465). Hippasus of Metapontum,\nwho was thought by many to have demonstrated this kind of\nincommensurability, is held by legend to have been drowned by the gods\nfor revealing his discovery (Heath 1921, 154; von Fritz 1970,\n407).\n\nGiven these historical roots, some authors reserve the term\n\u201cincommensurable\u201d for comparisons that can be made, but\nnot cardinally (Stocker 1980, 176; Stocker 1997, 203; Chang 1997b, 2).\nOthers interpret the idea of a common measure more broadly. On this\nbroader interpretation, for there to be a common measure, all that is\nrequired is that ordinal comparisons or rankings are possible. Values\nor bearers of value are then incommensurable only when not even an\nordinal comparison or ranking is possible (e.g., Raz 1986; Rabinowicz\n2021a). On this interpretation, incommensurability is defined as the\nrelation that holds between two items when neither is better than the\nother nor are they equally as good.\n\nOthers\nhave not given an exact\ndefinition of the term, but use it as an inclusive umbrella term for\ncomparability problems in general. This inclusive interpretation has\nthe advantage of encompassing a field of diverse philosophical\ndiscussions which engages in problems concerning value comparisons.\nThis entry encourages the use of \u201cincommensurable\u201d in the\netymologically correct way i.e., to refer to the lack of a cardinal\nscale.\n1.2 Incommensurable or Incomparable? \n\nBecause the idea of comparison is closely tied to the topic of value\nincommensurability, this has led to use of the term\n\u201cincomparable\u201d alongside \u201cincommensurable\u201d in\nthe literature. Some authors use the terms interchangeably (e.g., Raz\n1986). Others use them to refer to distinct concepts (e.g., Chang\n1997b). This entry will use the term \u201cincomparable\u201d to\nrefer to the possibility that no positive value relation holds between\ntwo value bearers (Chang 1997b). Positive value relations specify how\ntwo items compare (e.g., \u201cbetter than\u201d) rather than how\ntwo items do not compare (e.g., \u201cnot better than\u201d).\n\nIncomparability is often taken to be a three-place relation: A is\nincomparable with B with respect to V. \u201cV\u201d is here some\nspecific consideration for which the items are being compared. One\ncareer may be incomparable to another with respect to the sense of\npurpose it will bring to your life, yet they may be comparable with\nrespect to financial stability since one is clearly better than the\nother in this regard. Some argue that without specifying this\n\u201ccovering consideration\u201d the comparative claim makes no\nsense (Chang 1997; Thomson 1997; Andersson 2016b). Often, however, the\ncovering consideration is not explicitly expressed, but implicitly\nassumed by the context of utterance.\n\nSpecifying the covering consideration also allows us to identify\n\u201cnoncomparability\u201d. If no single covering consideration is\napplicable to the things we are comparing, then the things are\nnoncomparable. For example, the number four is noncomparable with the\ncolor blue with respect to their tastiness. This form of comparative\nfailure is considered to be of no interest from the perspective of\npractical reasoning and is consequently not given much consideration\nin the literature.\n\nFrom the fact that two things are incommensurable i.e., lack a common\nunit of measurement, it does not follow that they are incomparable. It\nis possible to correctly judge that one thing is better than the other\nwhile it being impossible to measure how much better it is. However,\nwhen there is incomparability there is also incommensurability. If no\npositive value relation holds between two things, then they cannot be\nplaced on the same cardinal scale.\n\nWhile both incommensurability and incomparability are important\nconcepts, much of the recent research has focused on the more specific\npossibility of incomparable value bearers. Different competing\naccounts have been given for examples that seem to point to the\npossibility of things being incomparable. These examples often take\nthe form similar to that of Joseph Raz\u2019s example in which a\nperson faces the choice between two successful careers: one as a\nlawyer and one as a clarinetist. Neither career seems better than the\nother, and they also do not appear to be equally good. If they were of\nequal value, then a slightly improved version of the legal career\nwould be better than the musical career, but this judgment appears\nincorrect (Raz 1986, 332).\n\nThe focus on incomparability can be motived by its possible\nsignificance for rational choice. Comparing alternatives are central\nfor rational choice, we want to know what alternative is the best, and\nthus examples of incomparability are taken to be a threat to rational\ndecision-making. Incommensurability on the other hand is mostly of\ntheoretical interest. The possibility of incommensurable values\nintroduces restrictions for normative theories, in the sense that they\nshould not assume that all values can be represented on the same\ncardinal scale. The focus on incomparability can thus be justified by\nreferring to its relation to practical reason and rational choice.\n\nThe remainder of section 1 considers proposed ways in which to\nconceive of value incommensurability.\n1.3 Conceptions of Value Incommensurability \n\nThis section outlines three conceptions of value incommensurability,\neach one capturing some sense in which incommensurability is due to\nthe lack of a common measure.\n\nThe first conception characterizes value incommensurability in terms\nof restrictions on how the further realization of one value outranks\nrealization of another value. James Griffin has proposed forms of\nvalue incommensurability of this sort. One form involves what he calls\n\u201ctrumping.\u201d In a conflict between values A and\nB, A is said to trump B if\n\u201cany amount of A, no matter how small, is more\nvaluable than any amount of B, no matter how\nlarge\u201d (Griffin 1986, 83). A weaker form of value\nincommensurability involves what Griffin calls\n\u201cdiscontinuity.\u201d Two values, A and B,\nare incommensurable in this sense if \u201cso long as we have enough\nof B any amount of A outranks any further amount of\nB; or that enough of A outranks any amount of\nB\u201d (Griffin 1986, 85).\n\nIf values are incommensurable in this first sense, there is no\nambiguity whether the realization of one value outranks realization of\nthe other. Ambiguity as to whether the realization of one value\noutranks realization of the other, however, is thought by many\ntheorists to be a central feature of incommensurable values. The\nsecond and third conceptions of value incommensurability aim to\ncapture this feature.\n\nAccording to the second conception, values are incommensurable if and\nonly if there is no true general overall ranking of the realization of\none value against the realization of the other value. David Wiggins,\nfor example, puts this forward as one conception of value\nincommensurability. He writes that two values are incommensurable if\n\u201cthere is no general way in which A and B trade off in the whole\nrange of situations of choice and comparison in which they\nfigure\u201d (1997, 59).\n\nThis second conception of value incommensurability denies what Henry\nRichardson calls \u201cstrong commensurability\u201d (1994,\n104\u2013105). Strong commensurability is the thesis that there is a true\nranking of the realization of one value against the realization of the\nother value in terms of one common value across all conflicts of\nvalue. A denial of such a singular common value, however, does not\nrule out what Richardson calls \u201cweak commensurability\u201d\n(1994, 105). Weak commensurability is the thesis that in any given\nconflict of values, there is a true ranking of the realization of one\nvalue against the realization of the other value in terms of some\nvalue. This value may be one of the values in question or some\nindependent value. This value also may differ across value conflicts.\nThe denial of strong commensurability does not entail a denial of weak\ncommensurability. Even if there is no systematic or general way to\nresolve any given conflict of values, there may be some value in\nvirtue of which the realization of one value ranks against realization\nof the other. Donald Regan defends the thesis of strong\ncommensurability (Regan 1997).\n\nThe third conception of value incommensurability denies both strong\nand weak commensurability (Richardson 1994, Wiggins 1997, Williams\n1981). This conception claims that in some conflicts of values, there\nis no true ranking of values.\n\nThis third conception of value incommensurability is sometimes said to\nbe necessary to explain why, in conflicts of value, a gain in one\nvalue does not always cancel the loss in another value. This view\nassumes that, whenever there is a true ranking between the realization\nof one value and the realization of another value, the gain in one of\nthe values cancels the loss in the other. Many commentators question\nthat assumption. This entry leaves open the possibility that when\nthere is a true ranking between the realization of one value and the\nrealization of another value, the gain in one of the two values need\nnot cancel the loss in the other.\n\nIf we accept this possibility, a number of questions arise. One\nquestion is what a ranking of realizations of values means if a gain\nin one value does not cancel the loss in the other. A second question\nis whether the first and second conceptions of value\nincommensurability each admit of two versions: one version in which\nthe gain in one value cancels the loss of the other and one version in\nwhich it does not. A third question concerns the relation between\nvalue incommensurability and tragedy. It may be thought that what\nmakes a choice tragic is that, no matter which alternative is chosen,\nthe gain in value cannot cancel the loss in the other value. Not all\nauthors, however, regard all value conflicts involving incommensurable\nvalues as tragic (Richardson 1994, 117). Wiggins, for example,\nreserves the second conception of value incommensurability for what he\ncalls \u201ccommon or garden variety incommensurable\u201d choices\nand the third conception for what he calls \u201ccircumstantially cum\ntragically incommensurable\u201d choices (1997, 64).\n2. Incomparability \n\nRather than focus on commensurability between abstract values, recent\nresearch focuses on the incomparability between concrete bearers of\nvalue, often in the context of choice (Broome 1997, 2000; Chang 1997,\n2002; Griffin 1986; Raz 1986). Bearers of value sometimes appear\nincomparable in cases like Joseph Raz\u2019s example of the choice\nbetween careers (described above in subsection 1.2).\n\nThe case for incomparability in such examples relies in part on what\nRuth Chang calls the \u201cSmall Improvement Argument\u201d (Chang\n2002b, 667). As noted in the initial discussion of the example, if the\nlegal and musical careers were of equal value, then a slightly\nimproved version of the legal career would be better than the musical\ncareer, but this judgment appears incorrect. The Small Improvement\nArgument takes the following general form: \u201cif (1) A is\nneither better nor worse than B (with respect to V),\n(2) A+ is better than A (with respect to\nV), (3) A+ is not better than B (with\nrespect to V), then (4) A and B are not\nrelated by any of the standard trichotomy of relations (relativized to\nV)\u201d where V represents the relevant set of\nconsiderations for purposes of the comparison (Chang 2002b,\n667\u2013668).  In addition to Raz, Derek Parfit and Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong are among those who have advanced the Small\nImprovement Argument (Parfit 1984; Sinnott-Armstrong 1985). A similar\nargument, but for preference relations has, however, a longer\nhistory. Leonard J. Savage hints towards this possibility already\n1954, in 1958 R. Duncan Luce presents a version of the argument that\nhe attributes to Howard Raiffa, and it is also discussed by Ronald de\nSousa in 1974 (Savage 1954; Luce 1958; de Sousa 1974).\n\nFocusing on the incomparability of bearers of value has given rise to\ntwo lines of inquiry in the literature. The first concerns the\nrelation between incomparability and vagueness; some argue that\nalleged examples of incomparability are better understood in terms of\nvagueness. The second concerns the range of comparative relations that\ncan hold between two items; some argue that the Small Improvement\nArgument does not establish incomparability but rather that there are\nmore value relations than previously believed. This section summarizes\ndebate within each line of inquiry.\n2.1 Vagueness\n\nRaz distinguishes incomparability from what he calls the\n\u201cindeterminacy\u201d of value. Recall that Raz defines two\nbearers of value as incomparable if and only if it is not true that\n\u201ceither one is better than the other or they are of equal\nvalue.\u201d The indeterminacy of value is a case of vagueness: it is\nneither true nor false of two items that \u201ceither one is better\nthan the other or they are of equal value.\u201d Raz regards the\nindeterminacy of value to result from the \u201cgeneral indeterminacy\nof language\u201d (1986, 324).\n\nIn contrast, other philosophers argue for interpreting alleged\nexamples of incomparability as vagueness (Griffin 1986, 96; Broome\n1997, 2000; Andersson 2017; Elson 2017; Dos Santos 2019). Some have\nargued that the Small Improvement Argument fails to rule out the\npossibility that it is indeterminate how the value bearers relate;\nthey may be related by one of the standard trichotomous relations, but\nit could be indeterminate which (Wasserman 2004; Klockseim 2010;\nGustafsson 2013).\n\nThere are also more positive arguments in favor of the vagueness\ninterpretation. For example, Broome introduces what he calls a\n\u201cstandard configuration\u201d (1997, 96; 2000, 23). Imagine the\nmusical and legal careers from Raz\u2019s example. Fix the musical\ncareer as the \u201cstandard.\u201d Now imagine variations in the\nlegal career arranged in a line such that in one direction, the\nvariations are increasingly better than the standard and in the other\ndirection, the standard is increasingly better than the variations.\nThere is an intermediate zone of legal careers that are not better\nthan the standard and such that the standard is not better than the\nlegal careers. If this zone contains one item, Broome defines this\nlegal career to be equally good with the standard. If this zone\ncontains more than one item, the zone is either one of \u201chard\nindeterminacy\u201d or one of \u201csoft indeterminacy.\u201d A\nzone cannot be both one of hard indeterminacy and one of soft\nindeterminacy. In a zone of hard indeterminacy, it is false that the\nlegal careers are better than the standard and false that the standard\nis better than the legal careers (1997, 73, 76). In a zone of soft\nindeterminacy, it is neither true nor false that the legal careers are\nbetter than the standard and neither true nor false that the standard\nis better than the legal careers (1997, 76). The latter is a zone of\nvagueness. Broome argues that indeterminate comparatives, including\n\u201cbetter than\u201d are softly indeterminate, thus there is no\nhard indeterminacy and no room for the possibility suggested by the\nSmall Improvement Argument.\n\nBy understanding incomparability to entail vagueness, Broome disagrees\nwith Raz (Broome 2000, 30). Raz defines incomparability so that it is\ncompatible with vagueness, but not so that it entails vagueness.\nGriffin also argues that incomparability entails vagueness (1986, 96).\nWhere Broome disagrees with Griffin is with regard to the width and\nsignificance of the zone of soft indeterminacy. Broome takes Griffin\nto suggest that if there is a zone of soft indeterminacy, it is narrow\nand unimportant. Broome argues that vagueness need not imply either\nnarrowness or lack of importance (2000, 30\u201331). \n\nCentral to Broome\u2019s argument is his controversial\n\u201ccollapsing principle\u201d for comparatives: For any x\nand y, if it is false that y is Fer than x\nand not false that x is Fer than y, then it is\ntrue that x is Fer than y (1997, 74). Many\ncounterexamples have been presented to show the implausibility of the\nprinciple (Carlson 2004, 2013; Elson 2014b; Gustafsson 2018). While\nthere are attempts to defend the collapsing principle, or versions of\nit, (Constantinescu 2012; Andersson & Herlitz 2018) the\ncounterexamples make Broome\u2019s argument less convincing. Another\nline of argument has consequently been developed in defense of the\nvagueness interpretation. It is argued that the vagueness\ninterpretation is theoretically parsimonious since it is natural to\naccept the existence of evaluative vagueness and if it can\neffortlessly account for alleged examples of incomparability then\nthere is no reason to accept the more mysterious notion of\nincomparability or to introduce more value relations beyond the\nstandard trichotomous relations (Andersson 2017; Elson 2017).\n2.2 \u201cRoughly Equal\u201d and \u201cOn a Par\u201d\n\nThe second line of inquiry concerns the set of possible comparative\nrelations that can obtain between two items. The small improvement\nargument for the incomparability of the musical career and the legal\ncareer in Raz\u2019s example assumes what Chang calls the\n\u201ctrichotomy thesis.\u201d The trichotomy thesis holds that if\ntwo items can be compared in terms of some value or set of values,\nthen the two items are related by one of the standard trichotomy of\ncomparative relations, \u201cbetter than,\u201d \u201cworse\nthan,\u201d or \u201cequally good\u201d (2002b, 660). A number of\nauthors have argued that these three comparative relations do not\nexhaust the space of comparative relations. If they are correct, the\nmusical career and the legal career may, in fact, be comparable.\n\nJames Griffin and Derek Parfit argue that items may in fact be\n\u201croughly equal\u201d and hence comparable (Griffin 1986, 80\u201381,\n96\u201398, and 104; 1997, 38\u201339; 2000, 285\u2013289; Parfit 1987, 431). As an\nillustration, Parfit imagines comparing two poets and a novelist for a\nliterary prize (1987, 431). Neither the First Poet nor the Novelist is\nworse than the other and the Second Poet is slightly better than the\nFirst Poet. If the First Poet and the Novelist were equally good, it\nwould follow that the Second Poet is better than the Novelist. This\njudgment, according to Parfit, need not follow. Instead, the First\nPoet and the Novelist may be roughly equal. The intuition is that even\nthough three items display the respects in virtue of which the\ncomparisons are made, some comparisons are inherently rough so that\neven though two alternatives are not worse than one other, they are\nnot equally good. In turn, the musical and legal careers in\nRaz\u2019s example may be roughly equal. Parfit later referred to\nthis possibility as there being \u201cevaluative imprecision\u201d\n(Parfit 2016, 113).\n\n\u201cRoughly equal,\u201d as used here, is to be distinguished from\ntwo other ways in which the term has been used: (1) to refer to a\nsmall difference in value between two items and (2) to refer to a\nchoice of little significance (Raz 1986, 333). As used here, two items\nA and B are said to be roughly equal if neither is worse than the\nother and C\u2019s being better than B does not imply that C is\nbetter than A when the comparisons are all in virtue of the same set\nof respects.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether \u201croughly equal\u201d is in\nfact a fourth comparative relation to be considered in addition to the\nthree standard relations, \u201cbetter than,\u201d \u201cworse\nthan,\u201d and \u201cequally good.\u201d One way to conceive of\n\u201croughly equal\u201d is as a \u201croughed up\u201d version\nof \u201cequally good.\u201d On this interpretation, the trichotomy\nthesis basically holds; there are simply precise and rough versions\n(Chang 2002b, 661, fn. 5). Furthermore, \u201croughly equal\u201d is\na relation that can be defined only in virtue of three items, and as\nsuch, appears to be something distinct from a standard comparative\nrelation. The standard comparative relations are binary; transitivity\nwith respect to them is a separate condition (Hsieh 2005, 195).\n\nA separate proposal for a genuine fourth relationship is Ruth\nChang\u2019s argument for \u201con a par\u201d (Chang 1997; Chang\n2002b). Two items are said to be on a par if neither is better than\nthe other, their differences preclude their being equally good, and\nyet they are comparable. Whereas \u201croughly equal\u201d is\ninvoked to allow for comparability among alternatives that display the\nsame respects (e.g., literary merit), \u201con a par\u201d is\ninvoked to allow for comparability between alternatives that are\ndifferent in the respects that they display. Imagine comparing Mozart\nand Michelangelo in terms of creativity. According to Chang, neither\nMozart nor Michelangelo is less creative than the other. Because the\ntwo artists display creativity in such different fields, however, it\nwould be mistaken to judge them to be equally creative. Nevertheless,\naccording to Chang, they are comparable with respect to creativity.\nSomething can be said about their relative merits with respect to the\nsame consideration. According to Chang, they are on a par.\n\nChang\u2019s argument relies on invoking a continuum that resembles\nBroome\u2019s standard configuration. Chang asks us to imagine a\nsequence of sculptors who are successively worse than Michelangelo\nuntil we arrive at a sculptor who is clearly worse than Mozart in\nterms of creativity. Chang then brings to bear the intuition that\n\u201cbetween two evaluatively very different items, a small\nunidimensional difference cannot trigger incomparability where before\nthere was comparability\u201d (2002b, 673). In the light of this\nintuition, because Mozart is comparable to this bad sculptor, Mozart\nis also comparable to each of the sculptors in the sequence, including\nMichelangelo. The soundness of this so-called Chaining Argument has,\nhowever, been questioned (Boot 2009; Elson 2014a; Andersson\n2016a).\n\nWhether \u201croughly equal\u201d or \u201con a par\u201d imply\ncomparability is a matter of some debate. \u201cRoughly equal\u201d\nand \u201con a par,\u201d for example, are intransitive, so to\nrecognize them as distinct comparative relations would require us to\nreconsider the transitivity of comparative relations (Hsieh 2007).\nSome authors suggest that one of the three standard comparative\nrelations obtains between all items that are claimed to be\nincomparable, roughly equal, or on a par (Regan 1997). In the case of\n\u201con a par,\u201d Joshua Gert and Erik Carlson have argued that\nit can be defined in terms of the three standard comparative relations\n(Gert 2004; 2015; Carlson 2010). Gert\u2019s suggestion is developed\nfurther by Wlodek Rabinowicz who provides a Fitting Attitudes account\nof value relations (Rabinowicz 2008; 2012). The Fitting Attitudes\naccount typically analyzes goodness in terms of a normative component\nand an attitudinal component. By acknowledging that there can be two\nlevels of normativity, requirement and permissibility, the account\nleaves room for both parity and standard value relations. X is\nbetter than Y if and only if it is rationally required to\nprefer X to Y, and X and Y are on a par if\nand only if it is rationally permissible to prefer X to\nY and also rationally permissible to prefer Y to\nX. Interestingly, preferences and the lack of preferences\ntogether with the two levels of normativity can be combined in 15\ndifferent ways. This means that the fitting attitudes analysis\nprovides the conceptual space for 15 possible value relations.\n\nAnother view is that values can be \u201cclumpy,\u201d meaning that\nthe values sort items into clumps. According to this view, once we\nrecognize the way in which the relation \u201cequally good\u201d\nfunctions in the context of clumpy values, items that appear to\nrequire \u201croughly equal\u201d or \u201con a par\u201d can be\njudged equally good (Hsieh 2005).\n3. Arguments for Value Incommensurability and Incomparability\n\nWhile recent research has focused on value incomparability and how to\ninterpret examples that have the structure described by the Small\nImprovement Argument, earlier research had less focus on the structure\nof value but focused more on substantial consideration that talks in\nfavor of incomparability. In this section, such considerations will be\ndiscussed.\n\nFirst, a note on terminology. Most of the arguments discuss something\nthat is similar to the phenomenon of incomparability but refer to the\nphenomenon in terms of \u201cincommensurability\u201d.  In this\nsection, the terminology of the discussed authors will be respected,\nand thus \u201cincommensurability\u201d will sometimes be used, even\nthough, the authors possibly refer to the phenomenon of\nincomparability.\n\nIt should be noted that value pluralism seems central for the\npossibility of incomparability. After all, the most direct argument\nagainst the possibility that values are incommensurable or\nincomparable is based on value monism (e.g., Mill 1861 [1979] and Sidgwick\n1874 [1981]). Donald Regan, for example, argues that \u201cgiven any two\nitems (objects, experiences, states of affairs, whatever) sufficiently\nwell specified so that it is apposite to inquire into their\n(intrinsic) value in the Moorean sense, then either one is better than\nthe other, or the two are precisely equal in value\u201d (Regan 1997,\n129).\n\nThis argument has been questioned. As Ruth Chang points out, by\nreferring to John Stuart Mill, that values may have both qualitative\nand quantitative aspects could in principle allow for value bearers to\nbe incomparable due to a difference in their qualitative features.\n(Chang 1997b, 16\u201317).\n\nFor purposes of this entry, it will not be assumed that value monism\nrules out incomparability. In any case, many philosophers argue for\nsome form of value pluralism (Berlin 1969, Finnis 1981, Nagel 1979,\nRaz 1986, Stocker 1990, Taylor 1982, Williams 1981). Although this\nentry will not assume value pluralism, most philosophers who argue for\nincommensurability or incomparability are value pluralists, so it will\nbe simpler to present their views by talking of separate values.\n3.1 Constitutive Incommensurability\n\nIt has been argued that value incomparability is constitutive of\ncertain goods and values and consequently we should assume its\nexistence. Two versions of this second argument will be discussed\nhere.\n\nOne version of this argument comes from Joseph Raz. Consider being\noffered a significant amount of money to leave one\u2019s spouse for\na month. The indignation that is typically experienced in response to\nsuch an offer, according to Raz, is grounded in part in the symbolic\nsignificance of certain actions (1986, 349). In this case, \u201cwhat\nhas symbolic significance is the very judgment that companionship is\nincommensurable with money\u201d (1986, 350). Although this form of\nvalue incommensurability looks like trumping, Raz does not see this as\na case of trumping. He rejects the view that companionship is more\nvaluable than money. If such a view were correct, then those who forgo\ncompanionship for money would be acting against reason (1986, 352).\nInstead, Raz takes the view that a \u201cbelief in incommensurability\nis itself a qualification for having certain relations\u201d (1986,\n351). Someone who does not regard companionship and money as\nincommensurable simply has chosen a kind of life that may be\nfulfilling in many ways, but being capable of having companionship is\nnot one of them.\n\nIn Raz\u2019s account, the symbolic significance of judging money to\nbe incommensurable with companionship involves the existence of a\nsocial convention that determines participation in that convention\n(e.g., marriage) that requires a belief in value incommensurability.\nThis conventional nature of belief in value incommensurability in\nRaz\u2019s account raises a question for some authors about its\nrobustness as an account of value incommensurability. For example,\nChang objects that incommensurability appears to become relative to\none\u2019s participation in social conventions (2001, 48). It remains\nan open question how much of a problem this point raises. Raz\u2019s\naccount appears to illustrate a basic sense in which the values of\nmoney and companionship can be incommensurable. Insofar as it is not\nagainst reason to choose money over companionship, there is no general\nway to resolve a conflict of values between money and companionship.\nIn Raz\u2019s account, the resolution depends upon which social\nconvention one has chosen to pursue.\n\nElizabeth Anderson advances a second argument for constitutive\nincommensurability. Her account is grounded in a pragmatic account of\nvalue. Anderson reduces \u201c\u2018x is good\u2019 roughly to\n\u2018it is rational to value x,\u2019 where to value something is\nto adopt toward it a favorable attitude susceptible to rational\nreflection\u201d (1997, 95). She argues that in virtue of these\nattitudes there may be no good reason to compare the overall values of\ntwo goods. Pragmatism holds that if such a comparison serves no\npractical function, then the comparative value judgment has no truth\nvalue, meaning that the goods are incommensurable (1997, 99). Because\nthe favorable attitudes one adopts toward goods help to make them\ngood, Anderson\u2019s account can be seen as an argument for\nconstitutive incommensurability (Chang 2001, 49).\n\nAnderson advances three ways in which there may be no good reason to\ncompare the overall values of goods. First, it may be boring or\npointless to engage in comparison. To illustrate, \u201cthe project\nof comprehensively ranking all works of art in terms of their\nintrinsic aesthetic value is foolish, boring, and stultifying\u201d\n(1997, 100). Second, Anderson points to instances in which \u201cit\nmakes sense to leave room for the free play of nonrational motivations\nlike whims and moods\u201d as in the choice of what to do on a\nleisurely Sunday afternoon (1997, 91). Third, Anderson argues that the\nroles that goods play in deliberation can be so different that\n\u201cattempts to compare them head to head are incoherent\u201d\n(1997, 91). Imagine that the only way to save one\u2019s dying mother\nis to give up a friendship. Rather than compare their overall values,\nargues Anderson, ordinary moral thinking focuses on what one owes to\none\u2019s mother and one\u2019s friends (1997, 102). This focus on\nobligation recognizes mother and friend each to be intrinsically\nvaluable and yet valuable in different ways (1997, 103). There is no\ngood reason, according to Anderson, to compare their overall values\nwith regard to some common measure.\n\nChang argues against each of the three points raised by Anderson\n(Chang 2001). In response to the first point, Chang notes there are\noccasions in which comparisons do need to be made between goods for\nwhich Anderson argues there is no good reason to make comparisons. In\nresponse to the second point, Chang argues that the range of instances\nfor which the second argument applies is small. In response to the\nthird point, Chang contends that Anderson\u2019s argument assumes\nthat if goods are comparable then they have some value or evaluative\nproperty in common. Chang points out that this need not be the\ncase.\n3.2 Moral Dilemmas\n\nBoth value incommensurability and incomparability have been invoked to\nmake sense of a central feature of supposed moral\ndilemmas\u2014namely, that no matter which alternative the agent\nchooses, she fails to do something she ought to do. The apparent value\nconflicts involved in these choices have led some philosophers to\nrelate moral dilemmas to the incomparability or incommensurability of\nvalues. Henry Richardson, for example, takes the situation confronting\nSophie in the novel Sophie\u2019s Choice\u2014that one of\nher two children will be spared death, but only if she chooses which\none to save\u2014to point to the incommensurability of values (1994,\n115\u2013117).\n\nIt has been argued that the mere fact of a moral dilemma does not\nimply incomparability. James Griffin, for example, argues that the\nfeature of \u201cirreplaceability\u201d in moral dilemmas often may\nbe mistaken as evidence for incomparability (1997, 37).\nIrreplaceability is the feature that what is lost in choosing one\nalternative over another cannot be replaced by what is gained in\nchoosing another alternative. Although a conflict of values displays\nthis feature, not all instances of irreplaceability need involve\nplural values. Some moral dilemmas, for example, may involve not a\nconflict of values, but a conflict of obligations that arises from the\nsame consideration. Consider forced choices in saving lives. If there\nis a dilemma, it need not involve conflicting values, but rather\nconflicting obligations that arise from the same consideration. Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong calls such dilemmas \u201csymmetrical\u201d (1988,\n54\u201358). The dilemma encountering Sophie, it may be said, does not\npoint to the incommensurability of values.\n\nRichardson acknowledges that the moral considerations underlying\nSophie\u2019s dilemma are not incommensurable. Nonetheless, he takes\nvalue incommensurability to be essential to understanding the tragedy\nof the dilemma that Sophie encounters. \u201cIt is a distinguishing\nfeature of love, including parental love,\u201d he writes,\n\u201cthat it cherishes the particular and unique features of the\nbeloved\u201d (115). He concludes, \u201cthe fact that she cannot\nadequately represent each child\u2019s value on a single scale is\nwhat makes the choosing tragic\u201d (116). By locating the\nincommensurability of values at the level of what is valuable about\neach of her children, Richardson argues that the tragedy of the\ndilemma points to incomparability.\n\nAnother common approach to argue for value incommensurability is with\nreference to \u201cnon-symmetrical\u201d dilemmas. As the name\nsuggests, in non-symmetrical dilemmas, the alternatives are favored by\ndifferent values (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988). If these values are\nincommensurable in the third sense as discussed in subsection 1.3,\nthere is no systematic resolution of the value conflict. Consider\nJean-Paul Sartre\u2019s well-known example of his pupil who faced the\nchoice between going to England to join the Free French Forces and\nstaying at home to help his mother live (Sartre 1975, 295\u2013296). No\nmatter which alternative he chooses, certain values will remain\nunrealized. An idea along these lines is considered, for example, by\nWalter Sinnott-Armstrong (1988, 69\u201371) and Bernard Williams (1981,\n74\u201378) in their discussions of moral dilemmas.\n3.3 Akrasia\n\nValue incommensurability also features in debates about\nakrasia (Nussbaum 2001, 113\u2013117). David Wiggins, for example,\ninvokes the idea of value incommensurability to suggest \u201cthe\nheterogeneity of the psychic sources of desire satisfaction and of\nevaluation\u201d (1998, 266). This heterogeneity, according to\nWiggins, allows for a coherent account of the agent\u2019s attraction\nto what is not best. It allows for a divergence between desire and\nvalue such that the akratic individual can be attracted to a value\nthat should not be sought at that point in time. Wiggins invokes value\nincommensurability to capture the idea that a gain in the value that\nshould not be sought does not reduce the loss in choosing what is not\nbest.\n\nIn contrast, Michael Stocker denies that value incommensurability is\nrequired for a coherent account of akrasia (1990, 214\u2013240).\nFor Stocker, coherent akrasia is possible with a single value\nin just the way that it is possible to be attracted to two objects\nthat differ with respect to the same value (e.g., \u201ca languorous\nlesser pleasure and a piquant better pleasure\u201d (1990, 230)).\nRecall the discussion of quantitative and qualitative aspects of a\nsingle value at the outset of section 3.\n4. Deliberation and Choice \n\nAs suggested above much of the inquiry into value incomparability is\nmotivated more generally by theories of practical reason and rational\nchoice. Even if a conception of justified choice can accommodate value\nincomparability, questions remain about how to justify choice on the\nbasis of incomparability and how to reason about incomparability. This\nsection considers these issues as they have been discussed in the\ncontemporary philosophical literature.\n\nIt is worth noting the potential for drawing connections between the\nphilosophical literature and the literature in psychology and the\nsocial sciences on decision-making. One area for such potential is the\npsychological literature on the difficulty of making decisions (Yates,\nVeinott, and Patalano 2003). Jane Beattie and Sema Barlas (2001), for\nexample, advance the thesis that the observed variation in the\ndifficulty of making trade-offs between alternatives can be explained\nin part by the category to which the alternatives belong. The authors\nconsider three categories: commodities (\u201cobjects that are\nappropriately bought and sold in markets\u201d), currencies\n(\u201cobjects that act as stand-ins for commodities\u201d), and\nnoncommodities (\u201cobjects that either cannot be transferred\n(e.g., pain) or that lose some of their value by being traded in\nmarkets (e.g., friendship)\u201d) (Beattie and Barlas 2001, 30). The\nauthors\u2019 experimental findings are consistent with participants\nholding normative commitments about exchanging currencies and\nnoncommodities similar to those considered in the discussion of\nconstitutive incommensurability in subsection 3.2. For example,\nBeattie and Barlas report that participants \u201chad a significant\ntendency to choose noncommodities over commodities and\ncurrencies\u201d and that choices between noncommodities and\ncurrencies were the easiest for participants (2001, 50\u201351). The\nauthors interpret these results to support the view that people choose\nnoncommodities over currencies on the basis of a rule without engaging\nin a calculation of trade-offs (2001, 51\u201353). In the context of\nempirical research, it should also be noted that philosophers have\ncontributed with empirical research on the characterization of hard\nchoices (Messerli and Reuter 2017a, 2017b).\n4.1 Optimization and Maximization\n\nAt a minimum, for the choice of an alternative to qualify as\njustified, there must not be an overriding reason against choosing it.\nBeyond that, conceptions of justified choice differ in what is\nrequired for the choice of an alternative to qualify as justified.\n\nRuth Chang defines \u201ccomparativism\u201d as the view that\n\u201ccomparative facts are what make a choice objectively correct;\nthey are that in virtue of which a choice is objectively rational or\nwhat one has most or sufficient normative reason to do. So, whether you\nare a consequentialist, deontologist, virtue theorist, perfectionist,\ncontractualist, etc., about the grounds of rational choice, you should\nbe, first and foremost, I suggest, a comparativist\u201d (2016, 213).\nIf alternatives are incomparable, then the lack of a comparative fact\nprecludes the possibility of justified choice.\n\nOne response has been to argue that apparently incomparable\nalternatives are, in fact, comparable. As discussed in subsection 2.2,\njudgments of incomparability frequently involve comparisons that are\ndifficult and it may be that judgments of incomparability are mistaken\n(Regan 1997) or that, due to vagueness, it is indeterminate which\nvalue relation holds. In addition, as discussed, alternatives that\nappear incomparable by way of \u201cbetter than,\u201d \u201cworse\nthan,\u201d or \u201cequally good\u201d may be comparable by way of\nsome fourth comparative relation, such as \u201croughly equal\u201d\nor \u201con a par.\u201d This means that there is a comparative fact\nthat makes a choice objectively correct in cases of apparent\nincomparability. It does not, however, help us identify the\nobjectively correct alternative.\n\nA common form of comparativism is optimization.\nAccording to optimization, the fact that an alternative is at least as\ngood as the other alternatives is what justifies its choice.\nConsequently, if two alternatives are incomparable no justified choice\ncan be made between them. Another line of response, one from within\nthe economics literature, has been to distinguish between\n\u201coptimization\u201d and \u201cmaximization\u201d as theories\nof justified choice (Sen 1997, 746; Sen 2000, 486). The theory of\nmaximization as justified choice only requires the choice of an\nalternative that is not worse than other alternatives. Because\nincomparable alternatives are not worse than one another, the choice\nof either is justified according to the theory of maximization as\njustified choice. Maximization is thus a rejection of comparativism.\nHowever, Hsieh (2007) argues that proponents of comparativism have no\nreason to reject maximization as an account of justified choice and\nconsequently incomparability need not pose a problem for the\npossibility of justified choice.\n4.2 Cyclical Choice\n\nOne objection voiced against accounts that permit justified choice\nbetween alternatives that are roughly equal or on a par or between\nincomparable alternatives is that such accounts may justify a series\nof choices that leaves a person worse off. Consider Raz\u2019s\nexample of career choice. Suppose the person chooses the musical\ncareer over the legal career. At a future time, she has the\nopportunity to pursue a legal career that is slightly worse than the\ninitial legal career. Suppose this slightly worse legal career and the\nmusical career are judged roughly equal or on a par. If justified\nchoice permits her to choose either of two alternatives when they are\nroughly equal or on a par, then she would be justified in choosing the\nslightly worse legal career. Similarly, if justified choice does not\nrequire the comparability of alternatives, she could be justified in\nchoosing the slightly worse legal career. Through a series of such\napparently justified choices, she would be left significantly worse\noff in a manner analogous to a \u201cmoney pump\u201d (Chang 1997,\n11).\n\nOne response is to question whether the problem posed by choices of\nthis sort is serious. John Broome, for example, notes that after\nhaving chosen one kind of career, a person may change her mind and\nchoose the kind of career she previously rejected. According to\nBroome, there would be a puzzle only if she did not repudiate her\nprevious choice (2000, 34).\n\nAnother line of response is that the considerations that make some\nalternatives worthy of choice count against the constant switching\namong alternatives envisioned in this objection. First, the constant\nswitching among alternatives is akin to not choosing an alternative.\nIf the alternatives are such that choosing either is better than\nchoosing neither, then the considerations that make the alternatives\nworthy of choice count against constantly switching among them.\nSecond, to switch constantly among careers appears to misunderstand\nwhat makes the alternatives worthy of choice. Not only is pursuing a\ncareer the kind of activity that depends upon continued engagement for\nits success, but it is also the kind of activity that is unlikely to\nbe judged truly successful unless one demonstrates some commitment to\nit. Third, for a career to be considered successful, it may require\nthe chooser to adopt a favorable attitude toward the considerations\nthat favor it over other careers. In turn, when subsequently presented\nwith the choice of a legal career, the considerations favoring it may\nno longer apply to her in the same way as they did before (Hsieh\n2007).\n\nRuth Chang advances a hybrid view on rational choice to meet the\nchallenge of cyclical choice. She distinguishes \u201cgiven\nreasons\u201d from \u201cwill-based\u201d reasons. Roughly put,\ngiven reasons could here be understood as those that are grounded in\nnormative facts while will-based reasons are \u201creasons in virtue\nof some act of the will; they are a matter of our creation. They are\nvoluntarist in their normative source. In short, we create will-based\nreasons and receive given ones.\u201d (Chang 2013, 177). Will-based\nreasons come into play when the given reasons no longer can guide our\nactions. When two alternatives are on a par, given reasons fail to\nguide us and at this stage, will-based reasons can provide guidance\nand guarantee that the agent commits to her choice. Anders Herlitz\n(2019) argues that Chang\u2019s approach and other \u201ctwo-step\nmodels\u201d violate an intuitively plausible constraint on rational\nchoice called Basic Contraction Consistency. By violating this\nconstraint two-step models also allow for money pumps. This could,\nhowever, possibly be avoided by introducing additional formal\nconditions for the second step in the model (Herlitz 2019,\n299\u2013307).\n4.3 Rational Eligibility\n\nThe idea expressed in the distinction between optimization and\nmaximization in subsection 4.1 can be expressed more generally in\nterms of the idea of rational eligibility. To say that an alternative\nis rationally eligible is to mean that choosing it would not be an\nunjustified choice. Which alternatives are judged rationally eligible\nmay vary with the theory of justified choice. According to\nmaximization as a theory of justified choice, an alternative is\nrationally eligible if and only if there is no better alternative.\n\nIsaac Levi (1986; 2004) argues for\n\u201cv-admissibility\u201d as a criterion of justified\nchoice. For v-admissibility, value incomparability does not\npose a problem for the possibility of justified choice. An alternative\nis v-admissible if and only if it is optimal according to at\nleast one of the relevant considerations at hand. In some conflicts of\nvalue, maximization and v-admissibility specify the same\nalternatives as rationally eligible. Suppose that alternative\nX is better than alternative Y with respect to\nconsideration A and alternative Y is better than\nalternative X with respect to consideration B.\nAccording to maximization as a theory of justified choice, both\nX and Y are rationally eligible; neither alternative\nis better than the other with respect to A and B\ntaken together. Both alternatives are also rationally eligible\naccording to v-admissibility; X is optimal with\nrespect to A and Y is optimal with respect to\nB.\n\nIn some conflicts of value, maximization and v-admissibility\nspecify different sets of alternatives as rationally eligible.\nV-admissibility is more restrictive than maximization (Levi\n2004). Add to the above example alternative Z. Suppose that\nX is better than Z, which is better than Y,\nall with respect to A. Suppose also that Y is better\nthan Z, which is better than X, all with respect to\nB. According to maximization as a theory of justified choice,\nX, Y, and Z are rationally eligible; no\nalternative is better than the other with respect to A and\nB taken together. However, Z is not rationally\neligible according to v-admissibility. Z is not\noptimal with respect to A. Nor is it optimal with respect to\nB. Only X and Y are rationally eligible\naccording to v-admissibility. According to Levi,\nv-admissibility captures what he takes to be a plausible\njudgment\u2014namely, that it would be unjustified to choose the\nalternative that is second worse on all relevant respects (Levi 2004).\nThe plausibility of this judgment might be questioned. Suppose that\nZ is only slightly worse than X with respect to\nA and Z is only slightly worse than Y with\nrespect to B. Does the judgment still hold?\n\nFor Joseph Raz, incomparability also does not pose a problem for the\npossibility of justified choice (1997). If incomparable options give\nus reasons to choose both alternatives, they are both rationally\neligible from the perspective of justified choice. As such, the choice\nof either alternative is justified on the basis of reason.\n\nOne question that arises is this. If an agent has reason to choose\neither alternative and they are not equally good, what makes her\nchoice of one alternative over another intelligible to her? For Raz,\nwhat explains the choice of one alternative over the other is the\nexercise of the will. By the will, Raz has in mind \u201cthe ability\nto choose and perform intentional actions\u201d and \u201cthe most\ntypical exercise or manifestation of the will is in choosing among\noptions that reason merely renders eligible\u201d (1997, 111).\n\nJohn Finnis advances a similar view in response to the question of\nintelligibility. Finnis writes, \u201cin free choice, one has reasons\nfor each of the alternative options, but these reasons are not\ncausally determinative.\u2026 No factor but the choosing itself\nsettles which alternative is chosen\u201d (1997, 220). In a\nchoice between alternatives each favored by different, incomparable\nvalues, even though there are reasons to choose both alternatives,\nbecause reasons are not causally determinative, the lack of a reason\nto choose one alternative over another need not render the choice\nunintelligible.\n\nDonald Regan challenges this view. According to Regan, unless grounded\nin an adequate reason, \u201ca decision to go one way rather than\nanother will be something that happened to the agent rather than\nsomething she did\u201d and hence be unintelligible to the agent\nherself (1997, 144). Suppose the agent has no more reason to choose\none alternative over another and the choice, as suggested above, is\nsettled by her wants. On Regan\u2019s view, if the agent\u2019s\nchoice is to be intelligible to her, her wants must be grounded in\nreasons. Because she has no more reason to choose one alternative over\nanother initially, the reasons grounding her wants must be available\nto her only after the initially relevant reasons are exhausted. This\nstrikes Regan as implausible (1997, 150). Regan concludes that no\nchoice between incomparable bearers of value is intelligible in the\nways suggested by Raz or Finnis.\n4.4 External Resources\n\nA number of authors have argued that practical reason has available to\nit the resources to accommodate incomparability in ways that would\nappear to address the concern raised by Regan.\n\nCharles Taylor outlines two such sets of resources. First, we are able\nto appeal to \u201cconstitutive goods that lie behind the life\ngoods\u201d our sense of which is \u201cfleshed out, and passed on,\nin a whole range of media: stories, legends, portraits of exemplary\nfigures and their actions and passions, as well as in artistic works,\nmusic, dance, ritual, modes of worship, and so on\u201d (1997, 179).\nSecond, we cannot escape the need to live an integrated life or to\nhave this, at a minimum, as an aspiration (1997, 180). Given that a\nlife is finite, leading a life involves an articulation of how\ndifferent goods fit into it relative to one another. More generally,\nour lives take on a certain \u201cshape\u201d and this shape\nprovides guidance in making choices in the face of incomparability\n(1997, 183). Michael Stocker similarly points out that alternatives\nare rarely considered in the abstract (1997). Instead, they are\nusually considered in concrete ways in which they are\nvaluable\u2014for example, as part of one\u2019s life. Once\nconsidered in such concrete contexts, there are considerations\naccording to which alternatives can be evaluated for purposes of\njustified choice. In his analysis of incommensurability, Fred\nD\u2019Agostino discusses the role of social institutions in\nresolving value conflicts (2003).\n\nAnother resource that has been invoked is morality. Recall Elizabeth\nAnderson\u2019s discussion of the example of the choice between\nsaving the life of one\u2019s mother and maintaining a close\nfriendship. Anderson regards the attempt to invoke a comparison of\nvalues as incoherent from the perspective of practical reason.\nInstead, ordinary moral thinking focuses on the obligations one has to\none\u2019s mother and one\u2019s friends. In turn, Anderson suggests\nthat the obligations themselves will provide guidance (1997, 106). The\navailability of such resources to reason is independent of her\ntheories of value and rationality. John Finnis also points to\nprinciples of morality as guiding reason which avoids comparability\nproblems (1997). It remains an open question as to how wide a range of\ncases it is in which morality can provide such guidance.\n\nOne worry that may arise in appealing to such external resources is\nthat they address the problem of incomparability by simply denying it.\nThe shape of one\u2019s life or the \u201cconstitutive goods that\nlie behind the life goods,\u201d for example, would appear to be\nsources of value. Insofar as they provide a value against which to\nresolve the initial value conflict, it might be said that there was no\nproblem of incomparability in the first place.\n\nTwo responses to this worry can be given. First, even if these\nexternal resources can ground comparisons, it does not follow that\nthey provide a systematic resolution to value conflicts. Insofar as\nthe shapes of people\u2019s lives differ, the way in which two\nindividuals resolve the same value conflict may be different. The fact\nthat it may be consistent with reason to resolve the same value\nconflict in different ways points to the possibility of\nincomparability.\n\nSecond, in the case of moral considerations, there may not be any\ndenial of incomparability. Moral considerations may provide guidance\nwithout comparing alternative courses of action (Finnis 1997,\n225\u2013226). Furthermore, some philosophers argue that the moral\nwrongness of certain actions is intelligible only in virtue of\nincomparability. For example, Alan Strudler argues that to deliberate\nabout the permissibility of lying in terms of comparable options is to\nmisunderstand the wrong in lying (1998, 1561\u20131564).\n4.5 Non-Maximizing Choice\n\nIt would appear that conceptions of justified choice that do not rely\non comparisons avoid the problems posed by incomparability. Stocker\naims to provide one such account of justified choice (1990; 1997). Two\nfeatures help to distinguish his account. First, he argues for\nevaluating alternatives as \u201cthe best\u201d in an absolute,\nrather than a relative, sense. Optimization and maximization rely on\nchoosing \u201cthe best\u201d in a relative sense: given the\nrelevant comparison class, there is no better alternative. To be\n\u201cthe best\u201d in an absolute sense, an alternative\n\u201cmust be, of its kind, excellent\u2014satisfying, or coming\nclose to, ideals and standards\u201d (1997, 206). This is the sense,\nfor example, in which a person can be the best of friends even if we\nmay have even better friends. More generally, an alternative can be\nabsolutely best even if there are better alternatives, and even if an\nalternative is relatively best, it may not be absolutely best. The\nsecond distinctive feature of Stocker\u2019s account is his appeal to\na good life, for example, or part of a good life or project. This\nappeal does not require the alternative to be the best for that life\nor project. Instead, the alternative need only be good enough for that\nlife or project to qualify as a justified choice.\n\nStocker\u2019s account of justified choice differs from the concept\nof \u201csatisficing\u201d as used in the economics and rational\nchoice literature. Introduced into the economics literature by Herbert\nSimon (1955), satisficing is the process of choosing in which it is\nrational to stop seeking alternatives when the agent finds one that is\n\u201cgood enough\u201d (Byron 2004). Where satisficing differs from\nStocker\u2019s account is that satisficing is instrumentally rational\nin virtue of a more general maximizing account of choice. In\nsituations in which finding the best alternative is prohibitively\ncostly or impossible, for example, satisficing becomes rational. In\ncontrast, on Stocker\u2019s account, choosing the alternative that is\n\u201cgood enough\u201d is non-instrumentally rational (Stocker\n2004).\n\nObjections discussed in previous sections may be raised with respect\nto Stocker\u2019s account. Suppose two alternatives are both good in\nan absolute sense and incomparable. According to Stocker\u2019s\naccount, insofar as both alternatives are good enough for an\nagent\u2019s life, the choice of either alternative appears\njustified. As discussed in subsection 4.2, Regan and others may object\nthat the choice of either alternative is not intelligible to the\nagent. Also, the appeal to a good life may raise the worry discussed\nin subsection 4.4 that Stocker\u2019s account addresses the problem\nof incomparability by simply denying it.\n4.6 Deliberation about Ends\n\nThe topics of value incommensurability and incomparability also arise\nin accounts that concern deliberation about ends. This section\ndiscusses two accounts.\n\nThe first account is by Henry Richardson (1994). Richardson argues for\nthe possibility of rational deliberation about ends. According to\nRichardson, if comparability is a prerequisite for rational choice,\nchoices involving conflicting values could be made rationally if each\nof the values were expressed in terms of their contribution to\nfurthering some common end. This conception of choice treats this\ncommon end as the one final end relevant for the choice. According to\nRichardson, the idea that comparability is a prerequisite for rational\nchoice seems to rule out rational deliberation about ends (1994,\n15).\n\nRichardson defends an account of rational deliberation about ends that\ndoes not depend upon comparability. In his account, rational\ndeliberation involves achieving coherence among one\u2019s ends.\nBriefly, coherence is \u201ca matter of finding or constructing\nintelligible connections or links or mutual support among them and of\nremoving relations of opposition or conflict\u201d (Richardson 1994,\n144). For Richardson, coherence among ends need not result in their\nbeing comparable (1994, 180).\n\nThe second account is by Elijah Millgram (1997). Like Richardson,\nMillgram argues that comparability is not a prerequisite for\ndeliberation. However, in contrast to Richardson, Millgram argues that\npractical deliberation results in the comparability of ends (1997,\n151). By this he means that through deliberation, one develops a\ncoherent conception of what matters and a \u201cbackground against\nwhich one can judge not only that one consideration is more important\nthan another, but how much more important\u201d (1997, 163).\nFor Millgram, comparing one\u2019s ends is a \u201ccentral part of\nattaining unified agency\u201d (1997, 162).\n\nMillgram proposes two ways in which deliberation results in the\ncomparability of ends. The first proposal is that one can learn what\nis important and how it is important through experience (1997, 161).\nThe second proposal is that deliberation about ends is\n\u201csomething like the construction by the agent of a conception of\nwhat matters \u2026 out of raw materials such as desires, ends,\npreferences, and reflexes\u201d (1997, 168). Millgram identifies an\nobjection to each proposal and briefly responds to each.\n\nThe objection to the first proposal is this. If the incomparability of\nends can be resolved by experience, this suggests that the judgment of\nincomparability reflects incomplete knowledge about the values\nexpressed in these ends. In other words, experience seems to help only\nif the values expressed in these ends are themselves comparable (1997,\n168). Millgram responds as follows. The agent who uses her experience\nto develop a coherent conception of what matters is like the painter\nwho uses her experience to paint a picture that is not a copy of an\nexisting image. Even if the ends are comparable in her conception of\nwhat matters, the values they reflect need not be comparable just as\nthe painting need not be an exact copy of an existing image.\n\nThe objection to the second proposal is this. The second proposal\nsuggests that deliberation is not driven by experience, which places\nit in tension with the first proposal. Millgram responds by continuing\nthe analogy with the painter. Imagine a painter who paints a picture\nthat is not a copy of an existing image. Just because the painting is\nnot a copy of an existing image does not mean there is no source of\ncorrection and constraint on it. Similarly, deliberation may involve\nthe construction by the agent of a conception of what matters, but\nthis does not imply that it is not informed or constrained by\nexperience (1997, 168\u2013169).\n4.7 Risky Actions\n\nCaspar Hare (2010) introduces and discusses a problem relating to how\nrational choice theory can encompass risky actions involving outcomes\nthat are on a par. If we assume that two outcomes, A and\nB, are on a par, it follows that a small improvement, or mild\nsweetening as Hare phrases it, to one of the outcomes would not break\nthe parity relation. We can imagine two actions, X and\nY. If we opt for X then we will either end up with a\nsweetened A in state 1 or a sweetened B in state 2, and\nthe outcomes are equiprobable. If we opt for Y, we will end up\nwith B in state 1 or A in state 2, and the outcomes are\nequiprobable. On the one hand, it seems as if we ought to opt for\nX since we will end up with a sweetened alternative, A+\nor B+. On the other hand, it is difficult to say why X\nis better than Y. The outcome in state 1 is not better if we do\nX rather than Y since the outcomes, A+ and\nB, are on a par, and the outcome in state 2 is not better if we\ndo Y rather than X since the outcomes, B+ and\nA, are on a par. The problem can be construed as a lottery\nwhere one lottery is deemed comparable with another, yet their outcomes\nare incomparable (see Rabinowicz, 2021b, for this axiological\nformulation of Hare\u2019s problem). Hare argues that we should\n\u201ctake the sugar\u201d, i.e., we ought to opt for X (see also\nBader 2019). Inspired by a Fitting-Attitudes Analysis of value Wlodek\nRabinowicz argues that even though outcomes may be on a par, it is\npossible for an action to be better than another (2021b). Others such\nas Schoenfield (2014), Bales, Cohen & Handfield (2014), and Doody\n(2019) reach the opposite conclusion.\n5. Social Choices and Institutions \n\nAs discussed above, social practices and institutions play a role in\nthe inquiry into value incommensurability and incomparability. They\nare claimed by some philosophers to ground the possibility of these\nphenomena as in the case of constitutive incommensurability\n(subsection 3.2), and to help resolve value conflicts, as in the case\nof providing external resources for practical reason (subsection 4.4).\nThis section discusses additional areas in which considerations about\nsocial institutions intersect with the inquiry at hand.\n\nTo begin, some philosophers have pointed to a structural similarity\nbetween a single individual trying to choose in the face of\nincomparability and the process of incorporating the varied interests\nand preferences of the members of society into a single decision. The\npreferences of different individuals, for example, may be taken to\nreflect differing evaluative judgments about alternatives so that\ncombining these different preferences into a single decision becomes\nanalogous to resolving value conflicts in the individual case. Given\nthis analogy, Fred D\u2019Agostino has applied methods of\ndecision-making at the social level from social choice theory and\npolitical theory to consider the resolution of value conflicts at the\nindividual level (2003).\n\nAt the same time, Richard Pildes and Elizabeth Anderson caution\nagainst wholeheartedly adopting this analogy. The analogy, according\nto them, assumes that individuals already have rationally ordered\npreferences. Given incomparability, however, there is no reason to\nmake such an assumption. In turn, Pildes and Anderson argue that\n\u201cindividuals need to participate actively in democratic\ninstitutions to enable them to achieve a rational ordering of their\npreferences for collective choices\u201d (1990, 2177).\n\nValue incommensurability and incomparability also have been considered\nwith respect to the law. Matthew Adler discusses the variety of ways\nin which legal scholars have engaged the topic of value\nincommensurability (1998). One question is whether the possibility of\nvalue incommensurability poses a problem for evaluating government\npolicy options and laws, more generally. Some authors respond that it\ndoes not. Cass Sunstein, for example, argues that recognition of value\nincommensurability helps \u201cto reveal what is at stake in many\nareas of the law\u201d (1994, 780). According to Sunstein, important\ncommitments of a well-functioning legal system are reflected in\nrecognizing value incommensurability.\n\nMore generally, a number of scholars have focused on the relation\nbetween incomparability and the structure of social and political\ninstitutions. John Finnis, for example, takes the open-endedness of\nsocial life to render it impossible to treat legal or policy choices\nas involving comparable alternatives (1997, 221\u2013222). Michael\nWalzer\u2019s account of distributive justice also relates\nincomparability to the structure of social and political institutions.\nAccording to Walzer (1983), different social goods occupy different\n\u201cspheres,\u201d each one governed by a distinct set of\ndistributive norms. What is unjust is to convert the accumulation of\ngoods in one sphere into the accumulation of goods in another sphere\nwithout regard for that second sphere\u2019s distributive norms.\nUnderlying Walzer\u2019s account, it seems, is a commitment to a kind\nof constitutive incommensurability. Given its connection to the\npossibility of plural and incompatible ways of life, the concepts of\nvalue incommensurability and incomparability also play a role in many\naccounts of political liberalism, including Joseph Raz\u2019s account\n(1986) and Isaiah Berlin\u2019s account (1969). The latter\u2019s\ninquiry into the relation between incommensurable values and political\ninstitutions motivated much of the further inquiry into the topic.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, M., 1998, \u201cLaw and Incommensurability:\nIntroduction,\u201d <em>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</em>,\n146: 1169\u20131184.", "Anderson, E., 1993, <em>Value in Ethics and Economics</em>,\nCambridge: Harvard University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1997, \u201cPractical Reason and\nIncommensurable Goods,\u201d in <em>Incommensurability,\nIncomparability, and Practical Reason</em>, R.
