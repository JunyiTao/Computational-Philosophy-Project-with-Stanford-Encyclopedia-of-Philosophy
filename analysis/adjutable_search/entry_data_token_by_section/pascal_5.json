    "main_text": "Ethics and Politics\n6. Pascal and Human Existence\n\n\nWhile it would be anachronistic to describe Pascal as an\nexistentialist, one of the most prominent features of his work is the\nphilosophical reflection on the radical contingency of human affairs\nthat emerges especially in the final years of his life. He used these\nreflections to puncture the pride, arrogance, and self-love of those\nwho thought of themselves as superior to the vicissitudes of human\nlife. Oliver Cromwell provided a contemporary illustration by his fall\nfrom power as a result of a relatively trivial\nillness. \u201cCromwell would have ravaged the whole of Christendom;\nthe royal family was lost, and his own family was about to become\nall-powerful, except for a little grain of sand that lodged in his\nbladder. Even Rome was about to tremble beneath him. Once this little\npiece of stone became lodged there, he died, his family was disgraced,\npeace was established all round, and the king was restored\u201d\n(Fragment 632: II, 799). Many of Pascal's intuitions about the\ncontingency of human existence were a commonplace in the period,\nespecially among Calvinist theologians (Rivet, 1651). They were\ninspired in part by a growing acceptance within cosmology of the\ninfinite extent of the universe and, in contrast, the relative brevity\nof human lives. They owed even more to a theological perspective that\nclaimed to represent human affairs from God's perspective, including\nthe absolute will by which He predestines individuals for salvation or\neternal perdition. Pascal's distinctive contribution was to capture\nsome of these insights in the elegant, pithy phrases that\ncharacterized the poetic style of the Pens\u00e9es.\nFragment 104, for example, compares a human life to a \u2018thinking\nreed.\u2019 \u201cIt is not in space that I should search for my\ndignity, but in the control of my thoughts \u2026 The universe\ncomprehends me by space and engulfs me like a point; by means of\nthought, I comprehend it\u201d (II, 574).\n\n\nOne could question the validity of considering the value of finite\nbeings from the naturalistic perspective of an infinite universe, or\neven the conceivability of a divine perspective that, even according\nto Pascal, is not naturally accessible to finite minds. Given his\nextremely poor health and the expressions of abandonment that emerge\nfrom his later writings, one cannot avoid considering whether Pascal's\nchoice of \u2018wretchedness\u2019 (la mis\u00e8re) as a\nsub-title for one group of \u2018thoughts\u2019 reflected his\npersonal experiences. \u201cThe greatness of human beings consists in\ntheir ability to know their wretchedness\u201d (Fragment 105: II,\n574).  Pascal's rejection of any naturalistic explanation of the human\nmind or soul, his emphasis on dread of an unknown future (because,\naccording to his theology, we do not know whether we are saved or\ndamned), the apparent insignificance of human existence, and the\nexperience of being dominated by political and natural forces that far\nexceed our limited powers, strike a chord of recognition with some of\nthe existentialist writings that emerged in Europe following the\nSecond World War. This was philosophy in a different register. For\nthat reason, some commentators reject the suggestion that Pascal was\nnot a philosopher (Brun, 1992; Hunter, 2013). Rather than speculate\nabout matters that transcend the limited capacity of the human\nintellect, Pascal invites his readers to recognize the description of\nhis personal experiences as resonating with their own. While\nemphasizing the natural insignificance of individual human lives, he\ndid not conclude that human existence was absurd. He pointed instead,\nas Christian existentialists have done since, to a source of meaning\nthat would transcend the limitations of our thought. Access, however,\nwas strictly limited to those to whom God freely gave the gift of\nreligious faith, without any merit on the part of the recipient.\n",
