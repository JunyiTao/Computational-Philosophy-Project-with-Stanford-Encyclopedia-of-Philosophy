    "main_text": "Facts and States of Affairs || Are Facts Just Obtaining States of Affairs?\n3.2 Are Facts Just Obtaining States of Affairs?\n\nStates of affairs contain particulars and properties; facts tie them.\nThis similarity encourages the question whether a fact is nothing but\na state of affairs that obtains (see Horwich 1990: 113 who\ntakes true Russellian propositions to be facts). On this view the\nreason why it is redundant to say that a fact obtains is that a fact\nis just an obtaining state of affairs. However, the identification of\nfacts with obtaining states of affairs creates problems for the theory\nof truthmaking. Assume that the fact that Socrates is wise is just the\nobtaining state of affairs Socrates\u2019 being wise. The\nfact is supposed to make it true that Socrates is wise. But if the\nfact is just the obtaining state of affairs Socrates\u2019 being\nwise, we need in turn something that explains why the state of\naffairs obtains. For it seems correct to say \u201cThe state of\naffairs Socrates\u2019 being wise obtains because Socrates\nis wise\u201d, but not \u201cSocrates is wise because the state of\naffairs Socrates\u2019 being wise obtains\u201d. Hence,\nobtaining states of affairs cannot play the same role as facts. They\ncannot be truth-makers. The question \u201cWhy is it true that\nSocrates is wise?\u201d cannot be conclusively answered by\nsaying \u201cBecause Socrates\u2019 being wise\nobtains\u201d. This answer is in need of a further explanation of the\nsame type as the one we were originally after.\n",
