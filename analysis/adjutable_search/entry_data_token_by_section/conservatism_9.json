    "main_text": "The Development of Conservative Thought || North American traditions\n2.5 North American traditions\n\nConservatism does not rest on a defence of a landed nobility, monarchy\nand established church, so even though the United States lacks these,\nan American conservatism is possible. However, it is argued that owing\nto its foundation as a constitutional republic, its essentially\nliberal political culture has determined American conservatism\u2019s\ncore commitments (Hartz 1955). Thus Gray argues that right-wing\nthought in the U.S.A. is almost exclusively neo-conservative and\nlibertarian, with a\n\n\nvirtual absence\u2026of anything comparable to European\nconservatism\u2026United States conservative thought is merely an\nindigenous variation on classical liberal themes of limited\ngovernment, individualism and economic progress [reflecting the]\nnear-ubiquity in American intellectual culture of individualist,\nuniversalist and Enlightenment themes. (Gray 2010: 166)\n\n\nJames Madison, one of the authors of The Federalist papers\n(1788), is claimed as an early American conservative; others are\nAlexander Hamilton, John Adams and John Calhoun. But it is probably\ntrue that Burkean conservatism has not produced thinkers in North\nAmerica of the depth of its leading British representatives, Burke\nhimself, Coleridge and Oakeshott. The original thinkers have instead\nbeen those of the maverick or \u201cheroic\u201d right\u2014a\ntradition including Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss and Hayek, whose patron\nis Nietzsche\u2014or those who belong to the libertarian right, such\nas Nozick. These thinkers are not sceptical conservatives in the\nBurkean tradition (Skorupski 2015; on Burke\u2019s influence in North\nAmerica, see Deane 2012). Vannatta describes as \u201cpragmatic\nconservatives\u201d Holmes and Dewey, whose political starting-point\nis present experience, customs and tradition (Vannatta 2014).\n",
