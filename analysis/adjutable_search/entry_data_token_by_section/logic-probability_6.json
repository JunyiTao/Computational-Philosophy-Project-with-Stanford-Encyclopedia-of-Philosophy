    "main_text": "Basic Probability Operators || Qualitative Representations of Uncertainty\n3.1 Qualitative Representations of Uncertainty\n\nThere are several applications in which qualitative theories of\nprobability might be useful, or even necessary. In some situations\nthere are no frequencies available to use as estimates for the\nprobabilities, or it might be practically impossible to obtain those\nfrequencies. Furthermore, people are often willing to compare\nthe probabilities of two statements (\u2018\\(\\phi\\) is more probable\nthan \\(\\psi\\)\u2019), without being able to assign explicit\nprobabilities to each of the statements individually\n(Szolovits and Pauker 1978, Halpern and Rabin 1987). In such\nsituations qualitative probability logics will be useful.\n\nOne of the earliest qualitative probability logics is Hamblin\u2019s\n(1959). The language is extended with a unary operator \\(\\Box\\), which\nis to be read as \u2018probably\u2019. Hence a formula such as\n\\(\\Box\\phi\\) is to be read as \u2018probably \\(\\phi\\)\u2019. This\nnotion of \u2018probable\u2019 can be formalized as sufficiently\nhigh (numerical) probability (i.e.\u00a0\\(P(\\phi)\\geq t\\), for\nsome threshold value \\(1/2 < t \\leq 1\\)), or alternatively in terms\nof plausibility, which is a non-metrical generalization of\nprobability. Burgess (1969) further develops these systems, focusing\non the \u2018high numerical probability\u2019-interpretation. Both\nHamblin and Burgess introduce additional operators into their systems\n(expressing, for example, metaphysical necessity and/or knowledge),\nand study the interaction between the \u2018probably\u2019-operator\nand these other modal operators. However, the\n\u2018probably\u2019-operator already displays some interesting\nfeatures on its own (independent from any other operators). If it is\ninterpreted as \u2018sufficiently high probability\u2019, then it\nfails to satisfy the principle \\((\\Box\\phi\\wedge\\Box\\psi) \\to\n\\Box(\\phi\\wedge\\psi)\\). This means that it is not a normal\nmodal operator, and cannot be given a Kripke (relational) semantics.\nHerzig and Longin (2003) and Arl\u00f3 Costa (2005) provide weaker\nsystems of neighborhood semantics for such\n\u2018probably\u2019-operators, while Yalcin (2010) discusses their\nbehavior from a more linguistically oriented perspective.\n\nAnother route is taken by Segerberg (1971) and G\u00e4rdenfors (1975a,\n1975b), who build on earlier work by de Finetti (1937), Kraft, Pratt\nand Seidenberg (1959) and Scott (1964). They introduce a\nbinary operator \\(\\geq\\); the formula \\(\\phi\\geq\\psi\\) is to\nbe read as \u2018\\(\\phi\\) is at least as probable as \\(\\psi\\)\u2019\n(formally: \\(P(\\phi)\\geq P(\\psi)\\)). The key idea is that one can\ncompletely axiomatize the behavior of \\(\\geq\\) without having to use\nthe \u2018underlying\u2019 probabilities of the individual formulas.\nIt should be noted that with comparative probability (a binary\noperator), one can also express some absolute probabilistic properties\n(unary operators). For example, \\(\\phi\\geq \\top\\) expresses that\n\\(\\phi\\) has probability 1, and \\(\\phi\\geq\\neg\\phi\\) expresses that\n\\(\\phi\\) has probability at least 1/2. More recently, Delgrande and\nRenne (2015) and Delgrande, Renne, and Sack (2019) further extend the\nqualitative approach, by allowing the arguments of \\(\\geq\\) to be\nfinite sequences of formulas (of potentially different\nlengths). The formula \\((\\phi_1,\\dots,\\phi_n) \\geq\n(\\psi_1,\\dots,\\psi_m)\\) is informally to be read as \u2018the sum of\nthe probabilities of the \\(\\phi_i\\)\u2019s is at least as high as the\nsum of the probabilities of the \\(\\psi_j\\)\u2019s\u2019. The\nresulting logic can be axiomatized completely, and \ncan capture any rational quantity, making it as expressive as some\nquantitiative probability logics.  However, it is still\ndistinct from quantitative probability logics, as there are no numbers\nin the language.  In the following sections, we direct our attention\nto quantitative probability logics.\n",
