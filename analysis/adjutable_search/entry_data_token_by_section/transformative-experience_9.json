Certainly, there are epistemic elements associated with\npersonal transformation: agents may not know how an\nexperience will personally transform them and they won\u2019t know\nwhat it\u2019s like to be transformed. There might also be\nde se knowledge, or self-locating knowledge of the kind that\noccurs when one knows who or where one is within a world (see Lewis\n1979). Significantly for the context of transformative experience,\nde se knowledge can apply to a temporal part of a person, so\nit\u2019s possible that someone who undergoes a transformative\nexperience will \u201clocate\u201d themselves as being the person\nwho results from the transformation, while their earlier self would\nhave lacked this de se knowledge since they may not have\ntaken the future, radically transformed person to be themselves. In\nany case, many of the considerations in the previous section apply to\nthese epistemic elements. However, personal transformation also\nintroduces interesting metaphysical issues, and this section focuses\nupon those.\n\nPaul describes the situation as being one that \u201cradically\nchanges what it is like to be you, perhaps by replacing your core\npreferences with very different ones\u201d (Paul 2015a, 156). Life goals,\ncore preferences, or the way one experiences the world may constitute\npart of the change that occurs. Ullmann-Margalit (2006, 159) adds that\nbecause our beliefs and desires shape the core of who we are, changes\nto them turn us into a \u201cdifferent person\u201d. There\u2019s\nalso a terrifying sense of finality since these personal\ntransformations are \u201cirrevocable\u201d (Ullman-Margalit 2006, 160) or at least potentially\nirrevocable. This picture painted by Paul and Ullmann-Margalit is\nsometimes characterized as a \u201cReplacement Model\u201d (see\nLambert & Schwenkler 2020b, \u00a7 5) because the agent contemplating\nundergoing transformation ends up \u201creplaced\u201d by the\ntransformed person. There\u2019s supposed to be a literal sense in\nwhich the pre-transformation agent ceases to exist.\n\nSpelling out the sense in which the agent no longer exists is tricky.\nFocusing on core features is one natural way to explain the difference\nbetween the pre-transformed agent and future transformed person.\nPerhaps when enough core features are lost, the pre-transformed agent\nceases to exist. (In essentialist language, perhaps some of these core\nfeatures are essential, or such that the agent cannot survive the loss\nof them.) There\u2019s an open question regarding which of our\nfeatures count as core in this way, and some empirical studies suggest\nthat we at least do regard some our features as being essential in\nthis way. Molouki, Chen, Urminsky, and Bartels (2020) have done\nempirical work to see whether people exhibit semi-uniform views about\nwhich features are central to their selves. Their findings support\nearlier work by Strohminger and Nichols (2014) suggesting that\nfeatures concerning morality (e.g., character traits) and personality\nare taken to be most central. Changes that are perceived as most\ndrastic involve morality and personality, as well as features that are\ntaken to be causally central. For instance, if someone takes\n\u201cbeing a philosopher\u201d to be causally central to how they\nnavigate the world, then they tend to regard losing that feature as a\ndrastic change. Valence and desires also matter: people take negative\nand undesired change to be more drastic. The explanation for\nasymmetric valence and desire perceptions rests upon the fact that\npeople project their future selves to undergo positive development, so\nnegative and undesired changes lie outside their self-conception.\nThese finding cohere with many of the sorts of personal\ntransformations that constitute personal transformations.\n\nA second sort of claim that\u2019s frequently made is that the\npre-transformed agent cannot identify first-personally with the future\ntransformed person, and vice versa. For instance, Velleman (1996)\ndraws a distinction between imagining what Napoleon saw when looking\nout at Austerlitz and imagining oneself as Napoleon looking out at\nAusterlitz. The latter removes all first-personal traces of the\nimaginer (and is likely impossible to do). Paul (2017) makes a similar\nclaim when distinguishing between affective and cognitive empathy. The\nformer involves projecting our current selves into potential future\nscenarios, like if I imagine what it will be for me (a childless\nperson) to have a child. It\u2019s akin to the way we empathize with\nothers. The latter is much richer, and it involves experiencing the\npotential future from the perspective of the future, rather than\ncurrent self. To cognitively empathize with my future self who has a\nchild, I would have to put myself into the first-personal experience\nof that person who now has the preferences and perspective of a\nparent. According to Paul, I lack the ability to cognitively empathize\nwith my future parent self because that self is too unrelated to my\ncurrent self. In general, we are not able to empathize with our\ndistant future selves, even if those selves haven\u2019t undergone a\ndramatic transformation. If Velleman and Paul are right, then the\nsevering of the first-personal perspective and empathy that occurs\nafter transformation is one way in which the pre-transformed agent\nceases to exist.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s helpful to take a step back and consider the ways\nin which the future-transformed person is a different person. Suppose\nthat losing central features and a disconnect in first-personal\nperspective are sufficient for replacing the pre-transformed agent\nwith a new person. How do we explain the connection between the future\nand past person? On the replacement theory, transformative change\nresults in a new person. Can we coherently say that the\npre-transformed person has become the new person? Or does\ntransformation annihilate and replace them?\n\nThe trick to explaining how one can become someone new without being\nannihilated involves articulating two different senses of\n\u201csameness\u201d: one in which the past and future persons are\nthe same and one in which they are not. For instance, Glazier (2020)\nnotes that the type of explanation demanded mirrors a debate about\nwhether contingentism is a coherent view. On contingentism,\nit\u2019s possible that I (or anyone else) could be someone else.\nPhilosophers who champion the necessity of identity tend to reject\nthis claim as straightforwardly absurd. To explain how their account\nis coherent, the contingentist must identify two senses in which\nidentity claims are necessary. Glazier\u2019s suggestion rests on the\nclaim that that no one\u2019s perspective is impossible. Roughly,\nthere\u2019s a proprial, or perspectival, sense in which a\nclaim like \u201cI am Fred\u201d is necessary. It\u2019s necessary\nfrom \u201cI\u2019s\u201d perspective that they are Fred because\nfrom their perspective the world is centered upon both the\n\u201cI\u201d and \u201cFred\u201d. However, it\u2019s possible\nthat the world could have centered on someone else, say Georgia. In\nthat case, there\u2019s a non-proprial sense in which \u201cI\u201d\nshould have been Georgia. This latter, non-proprial sense in which\n\u201cI should have been Georgia\u201d generates the contingency of\nidentity.\n\nChan (2019) offers a different account on which the past and future\npersons might be the same metaphysically speaking, but\ndifferent in terms of their practical identities. These\npractical identities are characterized by the traits that are changed\nin personal transformation: core preferences, life goals, ways of\nnavigating the world, continuity of first-personal identity, and the\nlike. Importantly, these traits form the person\u2019s self, or at\nleast the self that\u2019s relevant for considerations of\nself-interest. This explains why ordinary decision-making procedures\nhave difficulty when it comes to transformative experiences. (More on\nthis in the next section.) Furthermore, distinguishing between\nmetaphysical and practical senses of sameness explains the (practical)\nsense in which the person becomes someone new and the (metaphysical)\nsense in which they endure and are not annihilated.\n",
