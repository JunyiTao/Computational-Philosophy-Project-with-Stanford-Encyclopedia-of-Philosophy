The framework based on\ncounting-up units implies not only that biodiversity as variety is\nthat total count, but also that we can carry out lots of other\nimportant, associated, calculations that will be useful for\ndecision-making and policy\u2014notably looking at gains and losses.\nThis idea of a biodiversity \u201ccalculus\u201d contrasts with the\necologically oriented perspective that there are many different\nindices called \u201cbiodiversity\u201d.\n\nOne important companion calculation is called\n\u201ccomplementarity\u201d (Kirkpatrick 1983)\u2014the gains and\nlosses in biodiversity as objects are gained or lost. While\nbiodiversity is quantified by an inferred count of number of different\nunits, decision-making about biodiversity uses various calculations\nbased on those units. Complementarity usefully indicates marginal\nchanges\u2014the number of units lost, or the increase in the number\nrepresented by an added protected area. Faith (1994) focussed on\ncomplementarity as an example of useful calculations (referred to as\n\u201ccomponents of biodiversity\u201d) based on inferred counts of\nunits:\n\n\nThe problem of prioritising areas illustrates how pattern\n(specifically environmental pattern) can be used as a surrogate for\nbiodiversity, in predicting the same components of biodiversity that\nwould be used at the species level directly, notably\ncomplementarity.\n\n\nThe approach using environmental pattern for such calculations can be\ngeneralised to cover other patterns to make inferences about\nunderlying units. For PD, the pattern is phylogeny and a\nspecies\u2019 complementarity reflects the relative number of\nadditional features contributed by that species. PD decision-making\nsometimes uses calculations that are integrated with species\u2019\nestimated extinction probabilities\u2014extending the idea of\ncomplementarity to \u201cexpected\u201d loss. Priorities for\nconservation efforts for endangered species then can respond both to\ndegree of threat and to amount of potential loss of PD. One such\nconservation program is the EDGE of Existence program\n(\u201cevolutionarily distinct and globally endangered\u201d; see\nthe link in\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nBy recognising other calculations as useful, but not equated with\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d, and by side-stepping the weaknesses of the\nobjects-differences framework, we can focus on counting-up different\nunits, and focus on the value of having many different units. Thus,\nthe idea of a useful calculus further reinforces the role of\nbiodiversity-as-variety in providing option and insurance values.\n\nThis perspective is relevant to the second part of the IPBES\ndefinition of biodiversity (above), where \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\nis to include various measures of \u201cchange\u201d in\ndistribution, abundance etc. This perhaps reflects the ecology\nperspectives in which \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is equated with\nvarious ecological indices and calculations, such as dissimilarity or\nrelative abundance. Sometimes it is not at all clear how the key idea\nof \u201cbiodiversity loss\u201d\u2014complementarity\u2014applies\nin such cases. This issue is addressed further in the section below on\necology and ecosystems framings.\n",
