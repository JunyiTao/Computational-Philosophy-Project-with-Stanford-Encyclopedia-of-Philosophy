    "main_text": "Bargaining and Cooperative Games\n5. Bargaining and Cooperative Games\n\nAt the time when Arrow declared social choice to be impossible, Nash\n(1950) published a possibility theorem for the bargaining problem,\nwhich is the problem of finding an option acceptable to two parties,\namong a subset of alternatives. Interestingly, Nash relied on the\naxiomatic analysis just like Arrow, so that both can be given credit\nfor the introduction of this method in normative economics. In the\nsame decade, a similar contribution was made by Shapley (1953) to the\ntheory of cooperative games. The development of such approaches has\nbeen impressive since then, but some questioning has emerged regarding\nthe ethical relevance of this theory to issues of distributive\njustice.\n",
