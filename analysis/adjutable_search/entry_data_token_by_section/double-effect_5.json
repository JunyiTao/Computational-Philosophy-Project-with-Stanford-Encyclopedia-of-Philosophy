    "main_text": "Criticisms || The Side Effect Effect\n4.3 The Side Effect Effect\n\nAre we more inclined to call a harmful result a merely foreseen side\neffect when we believe that it is permissibly brought about, while\nalso being more inclined to describe a harmful result as something\nthat was intended as part of the agent\u2019s means when we believe\nthat it is impermissibly brought about? If so, there will be an\nassociation between permissible harms that are classified as side\neffects and impermissibly caused harms that are classified as results\nbrought about intentionally, but this association cannot be explained\nby the principle of double effect. Research by Joshua Knobe (2003,\n2006) has demonstrated that the ways in which we distinguish between\nresults that are intended or brought about intentionally and those\nthat are mere side effects may be influenced by normative judgments in\nsuch a way as to bias our descriptions: we are more likely to say a\nresult was brought about intentionally when we disapprove of it. This\nwas first pointed out by Gilbert Harman (1976), but is now often\nreferred to as \u201cThe Knobe Effect\u201d or \u201cThe Side\nEffect Effect\u201d. Suppose that an agent decided to swerve a\nrunaway trolley away from a track with a rare wildflower on it and\nonto a track with one track workman on it. Would you say that the\nagent intended to cause the track workman\u2019s death in order to\nspare the wildflower? If you would also say that the bystander who\nswitches the trolley away from the track with five track workmen on it\nand onto a track with one track workman on it foresees the death of\nthe one as a side effect of saving the five, but does not intend it,\nthen your judgments exemplify the Side Effect Effect. If you believe\nthat it is permissible to swerve the trolley onto the one to save five\nbut not permissible to swerve the trolley onto the one to save the\nwildflower, then this moral judgment influences whether the death of\nthe one is intended or a merely foreseen side effect. Does the\ndistinction between intended and merely foreseen consequences of\naction relied upon by the principle of double effect fail to serve as\nan evaluatively neutral basis for moral judgments? If so, it might\nguide and explain how actions are described without being a reliable\nguide to evaluating actions.\n",
