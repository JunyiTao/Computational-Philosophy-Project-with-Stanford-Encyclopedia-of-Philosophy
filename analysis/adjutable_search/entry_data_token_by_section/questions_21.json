On this view, it is possible for there to be two subjects who\nknow the truth of exactly the same answer-propositions but exhibit a\ndifference in knowledge-wh because one subject has a false belief that\nthe other subject lacks. George (2013) argues for this possibility\nusing an example in which there are two shops: Newstopia and\nPaperWorld. Newstopia sells newspapers, including ones from Italy,\nwhereas PaperWorld is a stationery shop and does not sell newspapers.\nConsider the following question:\n\n (51) Where can one buy\nan Italian newspaper? \n\n\n(51) is to be read as a \u201cmention-some\u201d question, so that a\nless-than-exhaustive answer is considered appropriate. That is, to\nanswer (51) it suffices to name one place where one can buy an Italian\nnewspaper. Suppose, next, that the epistemic and doxastic states of\ntwo individuals, Janna and Rupert, are as follows:\n\n (52)  a.\nJanna and Rupert know\nthat one can buy an Italian newspaper at Newstopia. \n\n   b.\nRupert believes\n(falsely) that one can buy an Italian newspaper at PaperWorld. \n \n   c.\nNeither Rupert nor Janna\nhas any other beliefs or knowledge concerning the availability of\nItalian newspapers.  \n\n\nIn the scenario described in (52), George (2013) argues, we can fix\nthe relevant contextual parameters and standards governing\nknowledge-wh in such a way that (53a) is true, yet, relative to the\nsame contextual parameters and standards, (53b) is false, and its\nfalsity is a consequence of Rupert\u2019s false belief about\nPaperWorld:\n\n (53)  a.\nJanna knows where one\ncan buy an Italian newspaper.  \n   b.\nRupert knows where one\ncan buy an Italian newspaper.  \n\n\nThe difference between Janna and Rupert can be described this way:\nwhereas Janna knows the truth of each answer to (51) that she\nbelieves, the same cannot be said of Rupert.\n\nPhillips and George (2018) present experimental empirical evidence\nsupporting the false-belief sensitivity of knowledge-wh. There is also\na substantial discussion of false-belief sensitivity in Theiler et\nal. 2018, where it is referred to as false answer\nsensitivity.\n",
