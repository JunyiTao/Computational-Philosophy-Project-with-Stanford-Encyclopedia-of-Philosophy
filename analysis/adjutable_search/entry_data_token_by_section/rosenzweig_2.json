    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || Hegel and the State\n1.2 Hegel and the State\n\n\nIn the fall of 1910, Rosenzweig left Freiburg for Berlin, where he\nbegan a period of archival work on Hegel\u2019s handwritten\nNachlass. Here he gathered the material for what would\neventually be his two-volume work, Hegel und der Staat.\nRosenzweig earned his PhD in the summer of 1912 for part of this work,\nand the book was nearly completed before the outbreak of the First\nWorld War, but Rosenzweig would only come to publish it in 1920.\nRosenzweig\u2019s Hegel und der Staat addresses itself to the\ntask Meinecke had delineated, in his Cosmopolitanism and the\nNational State, of understanding the political ideas of the\n19th Century as rooted in the personal and intellectual\ndevelopment of the creative thinkers who articulated them. In the book,\nRosenzweig traces the genesis of Hegel\u2019s political thought back\nto Hegel\u2019s earliest personal and philosophical musings over the\nrelationship between the human being and the world. Through careful\nreadings of Hegel\u2019s early handwritten manuscripts, Rosenzweig\nattempts to show that the Hegel of the mid-1790s found himself in a\nstate of perplexity over the possibility of reconciling the radical\nsubjectivity of the free individual human being with the objectivity of\nthe world. According to Rosenzweig, the path which the young Hegel\nfinds out of this perplexity, whereby he comes to understand the free\nself as realizing itself, and at once reconciling itself to the world,\nin time, enabled Hegel\u2019s own personal reconciliation\nwith his moment in history. More decisively for the history of\npolitical philosophy, it determined both the historical character of\nHegel\u2019s later thought, and the way he later came to understand\nthe reciprocal relation between the individual and the state in\nhistory.\n\n\nTowards the end of the book, Rosenzweig\u2014once again taking up\nMeinecke\u2019s Fragestellung\u2014considers Hegel\u2019s\nambiguous relation to the idea of the nation state. He notes how far\nHegel\u2019s rational view of the state is from the nationalist\nthought that arose in the second half of the 19th Century.\nBut he at once finds the confidence in the state which Hegel bequeathed\nto later nationalist thinkers\u2014a confidence in the state as the\nlocus of personal or national fulfillment, respectively\u2014to have\ncontributed to both the rise and the fall of the Bismarckian Reich.\n\n\nIn his post-war preface to Hegel und der Staat, Rosenzweig\nreflects on his initial hopes that the book might serve to\n\u201cdissolve the hard and limited Hegelian conception of the state\n\u2026 in its coming-to-be through the life of its thinker.\u201d\nIt is indeed the case that in situating Hegel\u2019s mature views of the\nstate within the trajectory of a lifetime of reflection about the\nrelationship between the self and the world in time, these mature\nviews seem to give way before the myriad political ideas and practical\npossibilities Hegel\u2019s thought might generate.  Perhaps the greatest\ncontribution Hegel und der Staat makes to its time, then, is\nthe way it shows Hegel\u2019s political thinking to be unexpectedly\nfruitful, just as Dilthey and Nohl had shown Hegel\u2019s theological thought to\nbe in the first decade of the 1900s. For it introduces to its readers\na Hegel whose reflections on selfhood, politics, and history are\nremarkably diverse, and hence available for appropriation in\nremarkably diverse directions. It is for this reason Rosenzweig had\nhoped, before the outset of the First World War, that his presentation\nof Hegel might help \u201copen up the prospect of a German future\nthat would be\u2014both inwardly and outwardly\u2014more\nspacious,\u201d that it might \u201cplay its small part in\npreparing, insofar as a book can\u201d, the path upon which\n\u201cthe Bismarckian state, its breathing restricted both internally\nand externally, would expand itself into a free empire breathing the\nair of the world.\u201d After the War, however, Rosenzweig could only\nmourn the fact that \u201ca field of ruins marks the spot where the\nempire previously stood.\u201d\n",
