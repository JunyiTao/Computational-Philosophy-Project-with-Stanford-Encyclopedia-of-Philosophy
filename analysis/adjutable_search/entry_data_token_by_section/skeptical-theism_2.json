    "main_text": "Outweighing Goods and Noseeum Inferences || Noseeum Inferences\n1.2 Noseeum Inferences\n\nConsider two situations given in the literature: a fawn, caught in a\nforest fire, that burned to death (cf. Rowe 1979), and a five-year-old\ngirl who was raped and then strangled to death (cf. Russell 1989).\nTheir sufferings are paradigms of evil. Now one might reflect on their\nsuffering, and try hard to identify God\u2019s reasons for permitting\ntheir suffering. An important sub-argument for\nN-O1.2 follows:\n\nNot-Outweighed\n\nN-O1.21\nAfter extensive reflection, it seems that there is no outweighing\ngood that would justify God\u2019s permission of the fawn\u2019s\nsuffering and the girl\u2019s suffering.\nN-O1.22\nTherefore, it is prima facie reasonable to believe that\nthere is no outweighing good that would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering.\nN-O1.2\nThere is at least one evil e such that God\u2019s\npermission of e is not necessary for some outweighing\ngood.\n\n\n\nThis argument is not valid, but inductive in nature. In defense of\nN-O1.21, authors like Rowe argue that the\nsuffering of the fawn and the girl seem unconnected from the concerns\nof traditional theodicies. Their suffering isn\u2019t the result of\ntheir own free will, for instance; nor does their suffering contribute\nto their \u201csoul-building\u201d of creating a superior moral\ncharacter. And while eternal union with God may be extremely good, it\nis hard to see how this suffering would be connected to it. Reflecting\non their suffering, it is hard to identify outweighing goods that\nwould justify God\u2019s permission of that suffering.\n\nThis way of defending N-O1.2 is sometimes\ncalled a \u201cnoseeum\u201d inference (Wykstra 1996). From the\nclaim that we \u201cno see\u201d an outweighing good, one infers\nthat there is no such outweighing good and, thus, there is no God.\n(Wykstra\u2019s inspiration for this term comes from the name of an\ninsect \u2013 a \u2018no-see-um\u2019 \u2013 that is normally too\nsmall to be seen, but can still leave a nasty welt.) Alternatively,\nthis way of defending N-O1.2 is called an\nargument from \u201cfailure of theodicy\u201d (Draper 2013), since\nit is the apparent failure of theodicies that make\nN-O1.2 reasonable to believe.\n",
