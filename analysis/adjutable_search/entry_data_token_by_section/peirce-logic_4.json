    "main_text": "From Symbolic to Iconic Representation || Pragmatic maxim applied to the logic of relations\n2.1 Pragmatic maxim applied to the logic of relations\n\nWithout challenging these existing explanations involving\nPeirce\u2019s EG, in this entry we would like to bring in one\noverlooked but crucial aspect of Peirce\u2019s journey to EG so that\nour story may fill in part of the puzzle of Peirce\u2019s overall\nphilosophy. Peirce\u2019s mission for a new logic started with how to\nrepresent relations, which led him to invent quantifiers and bound\nvariables, as we discussed in the previous section. The same\ncommitment, that is, to represent relations in a logical system, we\nclaim, was a main motivation behind Peirce\u2019s search for a new\nkind of sign systems\u2014iconic representation of relations.\nPeirce\u2019s work on Euler/Venn diagrams provides us with another\npiece of evidence to support our claim that the main motivation behind\nEG was to represent relations. While improving Venn systems, Peirce\nrealizes that the following defect cannot be eliminated:\n\n\n[T]he system [Venn\u2019s] affords no means of exhibiting reasoning,\nthe gist of which is of a relational or abstractional kind. It does\nnot extend to the logic of relatives. (Peirce 1911b [CP 4.356])\n\n\nAgain, we do not think this is the crucial ingredient for the\ncreation of EG, but one key element which works nicely together with\nhis theory of signs and his model-theoretic view of logic.\n\nPeirce\u2019s graphical representation first appears in his 1897\npaper \u201cThe Logic of Relatives\u201d. After his own new linear\nnotation came out in 1885 as seen above, why did Peirce revisit the\nlogic of relations? The first paragraph of the paper provides a direct\nanswer:\n\n\nI desire to convey some idea of what the new logic is, how two\n\u201calgebras\u201d, that is, systems of diagrammatical\nrepresentation by means of letters and other characters, more or less\nanalogous to those of the algebra of arithmetic, have been invented\nfor the study of the logic of relatives, and\u2026. (1897a [CP\n3.456])\n\n\nTwo things should be noted. One is that diagrammatic systems are also\ncalled \u201calgebra\u201d by Peirce. That is, according to Peirce,\nalgebra is not limited to symbolic systems. The other is that Peirce\nmakes it clear that two different forms of algebra carry out\nthe new logic, not new logics.\n\nIn thinking about the scope of the logic of relations, the question\narises: Why did Pierce feel the need for another form of\nrepresentation different from the 1885 notation? \u201cI must clearly\nshow what a relation is\u201d (1897a [CP 3.456]). The clear\nunderstanding of \u201crelations\u201d, Peirce believes, is a guide\nfor his excursion into different forms of logical systems. Here we\nwould like to draw reader\u2019s attention to Peirce\u2019s\nwell-known paper \u201cHow To Make Our Ideas Clear \u201d (1878),\nwhere three sections are devoted to the three grades of meaning (see\nthe entry on\n Peirce\u2019s theory of signs).\n\nThe first grade of understanding the word \u201crelation\u201d comes\nfrom our ordinary experience, and the second grade is to have a more\nabstract and general definition-like understanding. According to\nPeirce, that is not enough to achieve a full understanding of the word\n\u201crelation\u201d. Finally, Peirce\u2019s hallmark of the\npragmatic maxim leads us to the third grade of clarity:\n\n\nIt appears, then, the rule for attaining the third grade of clearness\nof apprehension is as follows: Consider what effects, which might\nconceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our\nconception to have. Then the whole of our conception of those effects\nis the whole of our conception of the object. (1878 [CP 5.402])\n\n\nIn order to understand what a relation is, we need to know what\nfollows from it. Then, the question is how we know what its\nconsequences are. Here is one answer given by Peirce in the 1897a\npaper, as far as the term \u201crelation\u201d goes:\n\n\nThe third grade of clearness consists in such a representation of the\nidea that fruitful reasoning can be made to turn upon it, and that it\ncan be applied to the resolution of difficult practical problems.\n(1897a [CP 3.457])\n\n\nTherefore, how a relation is represented is crucial in figuring out\nwhat follows from a relational state of affairs. Better\nrepresentations will yield more \u201cfruitful reasoning\u201d and\nhence, will be more helpful for solving practical problems. It is\nobvious that in the paper Peirce intends to search for more\ndesirable representations. Importantly, in section 4 when the\nthird grade of clearness of the meaning \u201crelation\u201d is\ndiscussed, diagrammatic representation of relations makes its first\nappearance.\n\nInfluenced by A. B. Kempe\u2019s graphic\n representation,[25]\n Peirce finds an analogy between relations and chemical compounds:\n\n\nA chemical atom is quite like a relative in having a definite number\nof loose ends or \u201cunsaturated bonds\u201d, corresponding to the\nblanks of the relative. (1897a [CP 3.469])\n\n\nA chemical molecule consists of chemical atoms, and how atoms are\nconnected with one another is based on the number of loose ends of\neach atom. For example, chemical atom H has one loose end and chemical\natom O has two. So, the following combination is possible, and it is a\nrepresentation of the water molecule, H2O:\n\n\n\n\nAn analogy to the logic of relations runs like this: A sentence\nconsists of names (proper names or indices) and predicates, and each\npredicate has a fixed arity. For example, the predicate\n\u201clove\u201d needs two names and \u201cgive\u201d three.\nHence, the following diagrammatic representation is grammatical and it\nis a representation of the proposition \u201cJohn loves\nMary\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nPeirce created a novel and productive analogy in representation\nbetween chemistry and the logic of relation by adopting the doctrine\nof valency as the key element for the analogy, as shown in the above\ntwo diagrams. Believing that this graphic style of representation\nwould help us conceive the consequences or effects of a given relation\nin a more efficient\n way,[26]\n Peirce presents Entitative Graphs, which is a predecessor of\n EG.[27]\n\nEG keeps the representation of a relation developed here, and remains\nas Peirce\u2019s final and the most cherished notation for the logic\nof relations (1903a). EG consists of three parts, Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, which correspond to propositional, first-order, and modal\nlogic, respectively. After presenting the Alpha system in a formal\nway, we discuss the Beta system of EG focusing on Peirce\u2019s novel\nideas in expanding a propositional graphic system to a\nquantificational graphic system. For more details, we recommend works\non EG by Roberts, Zeman, Sowa, and Shin.\n",
