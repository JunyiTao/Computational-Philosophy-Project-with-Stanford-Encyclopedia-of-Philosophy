    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Natural Kinds || Natural Classifications\n1.1 Natural Classifications\n1.1.1 Naturalism (weak realism)\n\nA common view concerning our so-called natural kind classifications is\nthat there are genuinely natural ways of classifying things.\nIntuitively, to group all instances of the metal zinc together is to\nengage in a natural classification, whereas to group together\nTrajan\u2019s column, the number two, and Julius Caesar is to\nclassify things in an arbitrary manner. The classifications\n\u2018cars manufactured in Germany\u2019, \u2018culinary\nvegetables\u2019, \u2018altars\u2019 are not arbitrary, but neither\nare they natural, since they reflect human interests. This view we\ncall naturalism. It is often called realism because\nof the close affinity to scientific realism; indeed naturalism may be\nregarded as a consequence or component of standard scientific realism.\nScientific realists hold that successful scientific theories represent\ntheory-independent phenomena. Thus the theoretical posits of science\nreflect natural divisions in nature; for example, the periodic system\nfor classifying the chemical elements reflects natural divisions\nbetween the elements. However, since \u2018realism\u2019 is also\nassociated with ontological doctrines (e.g., realism about universals,\nmodal realism etc.) it would be preferable to use weak\nrealism (or, as above, naturalism) to label the\nontologically uncommitted view that our classifications are often\nnatural. (We will note below that not all natural classifications are\nclassifications into natural kinds.)\n\nNaturalism need not maintain that all the classifications we in fact\ntake to be natural are indeed natural. Sometimes scientists and others\nerr in the natural kinds they take to exist. There is no kind that is\nphlogiston or phlogisticated air. Many might suppose jade to be a\nnatural kind of mineral, but it is not because there are two distinct\nminerals called \u2018jade\u2019. (See LaPorte 2004, 94\u2013100\nand Hacking 2007b for detailed discussions of jade.) Similarly,\nbiologists now believe that reptiles do not form a natural kind.\nNaturalism is the view that there are in fact natural divisions among\nthings, so that when we attempt to make a natural classification,\nthere is a fact of the matter as to whether that classification is\nindeed genuinely natural.\n\nAssuming that one is a naturalist about (some of) our classifications,\nwhat makes a classification into one of natural kinds? The following\nare often suggested criteria or characteristics of a natural kind\nclassification (some of which are more contentious than others):\n\n\nMembers of a natural kind should have some (natural) properties\nin common.\n\nThis is a necessary condition of kindhood, but not a sufficient\ncondition, for objects of very different kinds may share some natural\nproperty. As Mill (1884) remarks, white objects do not form a natural\nkind. Natural properties here are often taken to be intrinsic\nproperties. The latter claim, as will be discussed in Section\n2.1, leads to problems with biological kinds. Some, it should be\nnoted, hold that not all natural properties are intrinsic.\n\nNatural kinds should permit inductive inferences.\n\nThis is a point emphasized by Whewell (1860) and Mill (1884), and is\ncentral to Quine\u2019s (1969) discussion of natural kinds (see\nSection 1.2.1). On its own, this criterion also does not help\ndistinguish natural kinds from sets of objects sharing some natural\nproperty, and in that sense does not go beyond Criterion 1. Criterion\n2 is also a necessary but not sufficient condition on natural kind\nclassifications.\n\nNatural kinds should participate in laws of nature.\n\nThis may be considered as a stronger, metaphysical version of\nCriterion 2. It is correspondingly more contentious: if something is a\nduck, then it has webbed feet; but one need not hold that such\ninductively obtained conditionals regarding biological kinds must\nconstitute laws of nature. Even if this is a necessary condition, like\nCriteria 1 and 2, it fails to be a sufficient criterion. For laws of\nnature may concern natural qualities and quantities that do not define\nkinds (e.g. Newton\u2019s law of gravitation).\n\nMembers of a natural kind should form a kind.\n\nCriteria 1\u20133 supply related conditions that fail to be\nsufficient for kindhood. We may expand on Mill\u2019s example of\nwhite things, which do not form a natural kind; neither do negatively\ncharged things, nor do things with a mass of 1 kg. It is not\nimmediately clear what this criterion requires, but we may say that an\nadequacy condition on a satisfactory account of what kinds are must\naddress this \u2018kindhood\u2019 question (Hawley and Bird\n2011).\n\nNatural kinds should form a hierarchy.\n\nIf any two kinds overlap at all, then one is a subkind of the other,\nor they are identical (Kuhn 2000; Ellis 2001, 2002). This is\nexhibited, for example, by Linnaean taxonomy in biology. No organism\nis a member of two distinct species or genera. If organisms from\ndifferent species are members of the same genus, then all members of\nboth species are members of that genus. (One might add that every\norganism is a member of some species and some genus. In which case,\nthe Linnaean taxonomy provides a partition into species among all\norganisms and also within each genus.)\n\nNatural kinds should be categorically distinct.\n\nThere cannot be a smooth transition from one kind to another (Ellis\n2001). For then the borderline between them could not be one drawn by\nnature but is one that is somehow or other drawn by us. In which case\nthe kinds would not be genuinely natural. This is exhibited by the\nchemical elements. Chlorine and argon are neighbours in the periodic\ntable. There are no atoms that are intermediate between chlorine atoms\nand argon atoms, for the nucleus of an atom cannot have a number of\nprotons between seventeen (chlorine) and eighteen (argon).\n\n1.1.2 Conventionalism\n\nNaturalism about natural kind classifications contrasts with\nconventionalism (also called constructivism or\nconstructionism), the view natural kinds don\u2019t exist\nindependently of the scientists and others who talk about them. John\nStuart Mill expresses the contrast thus: \u201cIn so far as a natural\nclassification is grounded on real kinds, its groups are certainly not\nconventional; it is perfectly true that they do not depend upon an\narbitrary choice of the naturalist\u201d (Mill 1884, bk. IV, ch. II).\nWhile the sciences do, it appears, employ classifications according to\nkinds, the conventionalist will maintain that the purposes of\nscientists are just one species of interest among many: others will\ninclude the interests of automobile enthusiasts, of cooks, and of\nreligious people or sociologists of religion. Conventionalists\n(constructivists, constructionists) deny that any of our\nclassifications, including those of science, are naturally privileged\nforms of classification. The classifications of botanists do not carve\nnature at its joints any more than the classifications of cooks.\n\nWe may distinguish between weak conventionalism and strong\nconventionalism. Weak conventionalism asserts that our actual\nclassifications are not, or are very unlikely to be, natural. The\nprincipal ground for weak conventionalism is scepticism about the\nability of science to uncover the natural principles of\nclassification. We may attribute this reason for conventionalism to\nLocke (1690: III). It appears (although this is a matter of debate)\nthat Locke thought that if there were real essences of species, these\nwould be found in the shared imperceptible micro-structural properties\nof things, and that there may be such genuinely natural species but\nthat science was ill-equipped to do better than speculate about them.\n(Locke also held, employing Criterion 6 above, that there would be\n\u2018gaps\u2019 or \u2018chasms\u2019 between genuine species but\nthat observation showed only smooth gradations between the kinds we\nactually employ, which therefore must be conventional.)\n\nStrong conventionalism, however, goes on to deny even that\nconventionalism is forced upon us simply by ignorance. It denies that\nthere are any such natural divisions, known or unknown. Strong\nconventionalists claim that the differences and similarities that we\nattribute to things exist in virtue of, for example, the social\nfunction of the relevant concepts rather than in natural facts. For\nexample, the concept of gender is used to mark a distinction of social\nrole. The conventionalist treats natural kinds in the same way. The\nchemical elements, biological species, quarks, neutrinos and bosons\nare equally constructed by the activity of scientists. The key claim\nis that natural kinds are constructed rather than discovered. As\nWoolgar claims \u201cthere is no object beyond discourse\u201d\n(1988, 73).\n\nHacking (1999) argues against the strong version of conventionalism\n(which he terms \u2018universal constructivism\u2019). The point of\nsocial constructivism is to reveal that some of our classificatory\ncategories and practices, though they may appear inevitable, are\nactually contingent and relative to the practice of classification in\nthe context of social institutions and norms. However, according to\nHacking, some constructed categories reflect real divisions and so we\nneed not be constructivists in the strong sense. There is still room\nto distinguish between constructed kinds that reflect real categories\nand those that do not.\n\nFor example, Hacking (1999, Ch. 5) distinguishes between \u2018child\nabuse\u2019 and \u2018satanic ritual abuse\u2019. Satanic ritual\nabuse is a socially constructed idea, but not a social kind. In the\n1990s, there was an exhaustive investigation into satanic ritual abuse\nin Great Britain after a number of reported cases. However, an\nindependent commission claimed that none of the charges were\nsubstantiated by evidence. Thus, our constructed categories are\nsubject to empirical investigation. We must establish a referent class\nfor our constructed categories. For example and in contrast, a kind\nsuch as child abuse is considered real. The emergence of the category\ncan be traced to a definite time (1961) at a definite place (Denver)\nin the discussions of paediatricians. Moreover, the reference of the\ncategory was abused children. This reference dynamically changed as\nthe idea became embedded in new legislation, incorporated in practices\ninvolving social workers, police, schoolteachers etc. (see Hacking\n1999, Ch. 5.) But, importantly real instances of the category were\nfound through empirical investigation.\n\nThe chief claim made by all varieties of conventionalism is that facts\nabout the structure of the world are in some sense dependent on human\nbeings, their concepts and their activities in society. The denial of\nthis view, which we will examine in Section 1.2, is the claim that\nfacts about the world are independent of human beings, their concepts\nand their activities, that is, that there are real independent natural\nkinds in the world. The claim that scientific facts about the world\nare dependent on human activity has been analysed in\ndifferent ways by constructivists. Kukla (2000, Ch. 3) distinguishes\n(i) material, (ii) causal, and (iii) constitutive dependence. The\nfirst, and weakest, claim is material dependence, namely that\nscientific entities are constructed by the activities of scientists in\nthe laboratory. Chemical reactions are brought about by scientists in\nthe laboratory using purified chemicals in a controlled environment\n(Knorr-Cetina et al. 1983). The resultant kinds are merely the\nconstructs of this highly artificial environment, along with the\npragmatic interests of the scientists (i.e., what they are testing for\nand the methodology they choose to use). However, it is clear that\nscientists still abstract from a complex reality and in some\ncircumstances the materials used are purifications of some naturally\noccurring materials. Indeed, material dependence is a rather weak kind\nof conventionalism and could even be made compatible with some\nversions of naturalism/realism (cf. Hacking 1983). Therefore, no\ngeneral conclusion may be drawn about the natural world and its kinds,\nfrom the fact that scientists study scientific kinds in a highly\nidealized and controlled setting. The second element in Kukla\u2019s\nthree-fold distinction is causal dependence, which occurs when the\nrelevant facts are caused to be true by the fact that they are\nbelieved to be true (e.g. belief that there will be a run on the bank\ncan cause a run on the bank, Merton 1948). Hacking\u2019s (1995)\nhuman, interactive kinds, such as person with multiple-personality\ndisorder, may be regarded as instances, where the kind and its members\nare brought into existence by the belief that there are such kinds and\npeople do belong to them. Lastly, the constitutive dependence thesis\nclaims that convention is constitutive of the physical facts.\nPlausibly, conventions exist in virtue of people holding that they do.\nWoolgar\u2019s constructivism is of the type that treats all\nscientific facts like conventions in this respect.\n1.1.3 Promiscuous Realism\n\nDupr\u00e9 (1993) promiscuous realism claims that there are\ncountless ways of taxonomizing the world into kinds. The structure of\nthe world is vastly complex and can be categorized in many different\ncross-cutting ways, according to the different theoretical interests\nwe happen to be pursuing. Nevertheless, Dupr\u00e9 insists that his\nview is not conventionalist, but rather that he is committed to\nnaturalism and realism about natural kinds. He accepts that there are\nproperties that members of natural kinds have in common, but denies\nthat these are intrinsic properties of kinds (see Criterion 1 above).\nHe also denies that there is a hierarchical structure of natural kinds\nin the world (see Criterion 5 above) and that kinds are categorically\ndistinct (see Criterion 6 above).\n\nDupr\u00e9 (1993, 28) argues that promiscuous realism about natural\nkinds reflects our classificatory practices within the context of both\ncommon sense and particular sciences. The kinds classified by common\nsense and scientific practice often cross one another. For example, in\ncommon sense we classify lilies as a certain kind of flower. However,\nin biological classification the genus Lilium comprises over\none hundred species, including bulbs such as garlic and onions.\nMoreover, species with the name \u201clily\u201d in common sense do\nnot all in fact belong to the lilium genus in biological\nclassification (e.g., Calla Lilies and Canna Lilies). Therefore,\ncommon sense and biological science provide us with pluralistic ways\nof taxonomizing lilies. Each is equally legitimate, according to\nDupr\u00e9, depending on our interests. Furthermore, Dupr\u00e9\n(1993, 38) argues that cross-classification occurs even within the\ncontext of a science. Taking the biological classification of species\nas an example, he argues that there are countless ways of taxonomizing\nspecies, depending on the model of biological systematics that is used\n(see Section 2.1 below). There are equally legitimate, objectively\ngrounded ways of classifying natural kinds. There is accordingly no\nunique way of carving nature at its joints; different systems of\nclassification are equally acceptable, scientifically, and\nmetaphysically.\n",
