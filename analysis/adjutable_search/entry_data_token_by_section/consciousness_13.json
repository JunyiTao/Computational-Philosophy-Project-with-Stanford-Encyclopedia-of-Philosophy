    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Intentionality and transparency\n4.7 Intentionality and transparency\n\n\nConscious mental states are typically regarded as having a\nrepresentational or intentional aspect in so far as they are about\nthings, refer to things or have satisfaction conditions. One's\nconscious visual experience correctly represents the world if\nthere are lilacs in a white vase on the table (pace Travis 2004), one's\nconscious memory is of the attack on the World Trade Center,\nand one's conscious desire is for a glass of cold water.\nHowever, nonconscious states can also exhibit intentionality in such\nways, and it is important to understand the ways in which the\nrepresentational aspects of conscious states resemble and differ from\nthose of nonconscious states (Carruthers 2000). Searle (1990) offers a\ncontrary view according to which only conscious states and dispositions\nto have conscious states can be genuinely intentional, but most\ntheorists regard intentionality as extending widely into the\nunconscious domain. (See the entry on\n consciousness and intentionality.)\n\n\nOne potentially important dimension of difference concerns so called\ntransparency, which is an important feature of consciousness\nin two interrelated metaphoric senses, each of which has an\nintentional, an experiential and a functional aspect.\n\n\nConscious perceptual experience is often said to be transparent, or\nin G.E. Moore's (1922) phrase \u201cdiaphanous\u201d. We\ntransparently \u201clook through\u201d our sensory experience in so\nfar as we seem directly aware of external objects and events present to\nus rather than being aware of any properties of experience by which it\npresents or represents such objects to us. When I look out at the\nwind-blown meadow, it is the undulating green grass of which I am aware\nnot of any green property of my visual experience. (See the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness.)\n Moore himself believed we could become aware of those latter\nqualities with effort and redirection of attention, though some\ncontemporary transparency advocates deny it (Harman 1990, Tye\n1995, Kind 2003).\n\n\nConscious thoughts and experiences are also transparent in a\nsemantic sense in that their meanings seem immediately known to us in\nthe very act of thinking them (Van Gulick 1992). In that sense we might\nbe said to \u2018think right through\u2019 them to what they mean or\nrepresent. Transparency in this semantic sense may correspond at least\npartly with what John Searle calls the \u201cintrinsic\nintentionality\u201d of consciousness (Searle 1992).\n\n\nOur conscious mental states seem to have their meanings\nintrinsically or from the inside just by being what they are in\nthemselves, by contrast with many externalist theories of mental\ncontent that ground meaning in causal, counterfactual or informational\nrelations between bearers of intentionality and their semantic or\nreferential objects.\n\n\nThe view of conscious content as intrinsically determined and\ninternally self-evident is sometimes supported by appeals to brain in\nthe vat intuitions, which make it seem that the envatted brain's\nconscious mental states would keep all their normal intentional\ncontents despite the loss of all their normal causal and informational\nlinks to the world (Horgan and Tienson 2002). There is continued\ncontroversy about such cases and about competing internalist (Searle\n1992) and externalist views (Dretske 1995) of conscious\nintentionality.\n\n\nThough semantic transparency and intrinsic intentionality have some\naffinities, they should not be simply equated, since it may be possible\nto accommodate the former notion within a more externalist account of\ncontent and meaning. Both semantic and sensory transparency obviously\nconcern the representational or intentional aspects of consciousness,\nbut they are also experiential aspects of our conscious life. They are\npart of what it's like or how it feels phenomenally to be conscious.\nThey also both have functional aspects, in so far as conscious experiences\ninteract with each other in richly content-appropriate ways that\nmanifest our transparent understanding of their contents.\n",
