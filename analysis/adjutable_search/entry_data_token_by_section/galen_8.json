    "main_text": "Logic: Historical Contribution\n4. Logic: Historical Contribution\nWe have devoted considerable attention to the importance of logic for Galen in relation to the theory of demonstration and early intellectual training. Some account should also be given of his contribution to the broader theoretical study of logic, because\u2014although not of similar relevance to epistemology or the theory of science\u2014this contribution is, at least arguably, of considerable historical importance.\nCertain caveats must be given at the outset. Galen\u2019s most important work in this area, Demonstration, is lost to us except for fragments (though a shorter work, the important Introduction to Logic (Inst. Log.), does survive); and the precise nature of Galen\u2019s innovations, and final views, is a matter of debate amongst experts (for an overview, as well as an account of different views, see Morison 2008). In an area of great technical complexity and interpretive difficulty, we can here attempt no more than the briefest summary of the main issues and points of discussion. These may be said, broadly, to revolve around the questions of the nature and extent of the originality of Galen\u2019s contribution, and of the way in which he draws upon the work of both Aristotle and the Stoics.\nGalen\u2019s commentary on Aristotle (in a way consistent with the approach considered in \u00a73.5) involves not just explication but also addition. He claims that in his commentary on the Categories (again, unfortunately lost) he added an eleventh category to Aristotle\u2019s ten: that of \u201ccomposition\u201d. In the context of Aristotelian syllogistic logic, meanwhile, there is some suggestion that he felt it necessary to posit a fourth figure in addition to the Aristotelian three. In fact, there seems considerable doubt concerning both the value of such a fourth figure and Galen\u2019s authorship of it (Morison 2008: 85\u201391); a preferable interpretation may be that references to this \u201cfourth syllogism\u201d are not to a new categorization within the system of Aristotle\u2019s simple syllogisms, but rather (more interestingly) to an original attempt at the analysis of compound syllogisms, which Galen apparently carried out with specific reference to certain arguments in Plato.\nNo less interpretively challenging is the material concerning the other main areas of Galen\u2019s contribution, those relating to hypothetical logic and to the \u201crelational syllogism\u201d. The subject again resists non-specialist summary; but it seems uncontroversial, at least, (a) that Galen engages in detail with Stoic hypothetical syllogistic; (b) that he attacks the Stoics for particular aspects of their use of it; and (c) that this attack is in some way related to his own insistence on the priority of \u201cthings\u201d over \u201cexpressions\u201d (a motto which runs through much of Galen\u2019s other work, too, in the context of discussions of language). A final area of complexity and doubt concerns the relational syllogism, the introduction of which Galen claims as his innovation at Inst. Log. 16. What seems clear is that Galen brought this new type of syllogism forward in response to what he perceived as inadequacies in both Aristotelian and Stoic logic; also that he believed it to be of particular relevance for proofs in geometry and mathematics. An example of a relational syllogism\u2014from which such relevance is indeed clear\u2014is:\n\nTheo has twice as many possessions as Dio;\nbut Philo has twice as many possessions as Theo;\ntherefore, Philo has four times as many possessions as Dio.\n\n(One puzzling feature of relational syllogisms as presented by Galen is that he apparently sometimes does and sometimes does not mention the relevant axiom on which the syllogism depends, as part of the syllogism.)\nExperts have found Galen\u2019s theoretical contribution to logic not only interpretively problematic (although see Bobzien 2004), but also ultimately frustrating in its failure both to give a clear and consistent account of itself and to fulfil its ambition systematically to provide what is missing in the pre-existing tradition. What does seem clear is that Galen made a distinctive and in some ways influential and challenging contribution in this area, responding in an original way to both the Aristotelian and the Stoic logical tradition; and that even in the most abstract realm of logical analysis he retained a concern for the practical value of logic and its relatedness to things.\n",
