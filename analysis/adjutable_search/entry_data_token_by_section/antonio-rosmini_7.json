    "main_text": "Natural theology\n8. Natural theology\n\n\nRosmini\u2019s natural theology, in the conventional philosophical sense\nof natural theology, can be summarised under two headings: proofs for\nthe existence of God, found scattered throughout his philosophical\nwritings, and theodicy, developed at length in a work of that name. But\nit will also be considered, under the heading \u2018Being\u2019\naccording to the meaning given it by Rosmini.\n8.1 The existence of God\n\n\nIn his natural theology, Rosmini offers considerations which are\nconsistent with the basic principles of his philosophical teaching.\nAlthough he does not deny the validity of a posteriori proofs\nof the existence of God, he affirms that an a priori method is\nmore satisfactory because it sets off from the idea of being, the\nfoundation of his philosophy, and argues to the necessity of God\u2019s\nexistence. First, however, he posits a fundamental barrier to the\nperception of God at a purely natural level of human nature. For\nRosmini, what is real can only be perceived through feeling, which\nindeed is part of human existence but only at a finite level where it\ncannot be the vehicle of the perception of God\u2019s infinite reality.\nIdeal being, however, while expressing only the possibility, not the\nreality of things, is shown on analysis to be characterised by\nnecessity, eternity and immateriality, factors which are intrinsic\nmarks of possibility. The idea of being, therefore, with its divine\ncharacteristics serves as a bridge between God and human beings,\nenabling us to posit proofs of God\u2019s existence without our knowing him\nthrough perception, or real contact. One example of the a\npriori proofs may be given here. If infinite, intelligible being\nis present to the human mind\u2014and Rosmini would maintain that it is\u2014an infinite mind capable of giving this idea to humans must exist.\nBut such a mind cannot not be God. In this and all similar proofs,\nthere is a common mode of procedure. The existence of God is necessary\nfor the existence of intelligible being; but intelligible being\ncertainly exists; the existence of God is therefore necessary. Having\ndetermined the existence of God, Rosmini then makes use of divinely\nrevealed truth as a basis on which to offer some reflections about the\nnature of what he has proved to exist. These reflections, he would\nmaintain, lie within the scope of philosophy because they depend\nmethodologically solely on reason, and conclude with rational, not\nauthoritative affirmations. Their basis in revelation, however,\nprecludes any examination of them here.\n8.2 Theodicy\n\n\nRosmini provides an exact description of his aim in his work on\ntheodicy. \u2018Theodicy (theou dike) means \u201cjustice of God\u201d. The\nintent of this work, therefore, is simply this: to justify God\u2019s equity\nand goodness in the distribution of good and evil in the world.\u2019\n(Theodicy preface).\n\n\nHe also provides a clear indication of the method he will follow in\nthe three books composing his Theodicy. The first prescribes\nthe norms to be followed in judging about the disposition of divine\nprovidence if error is to be avoided; the second considers the laws of\nnature, the necessary limitations of what is created and the chain of\ncauses operating in the universe; the third is devoted to the laws\naccording to which God\u2019s action takes place in the world he has\ncreated. These laws all spring from a single norm, the law of the least\nmeans, which Rosmini, following Aquinas, posits as follows: \u2018The\nwise worker carries out his work in the briefest way possible\u2019\n(Sapiens operator perficit opus suum breviori via qua potest.\nST, III, q. 4, art. 5, ad 3um). From this law, another ten are\ndeduced whose titles provide a useful indication of their possible\napplication. They are the laws of: excluded superfluity, the permission\nof evil, excluded equality, unity in the divine work, heroism,\nantagonism, rapidity in work, accumulation of good, and germ. These\nlaws, according to Rosmini, are concerned with God\u2019s providence\nrelative to universal good. At the same time, but relative to\nparticular good, the law followed is that of: supreme justice, equity,\nfittingness and conformity to God\u2019s divine attributes. Divine\ngovernance consists in acting in such a way that the aspects of\nuniversal and particular good are harmonised.\n",
