    "main_text": "Fish and Insects\n3. Fish and Insects\n\nIn addition to pork and beef, there are salmon and crickets. In\naddition to lamb and chicken, there are mussels and shrimp. There is\nlittle in the philosophical literature about insects and sea creatures\nand their products, and this entry reflects\n that.[8]\n Yet the topics are important. The organization Fish Count estimates\nthat at least a trillion sea creatures are wild-caught or farmed each\nyear (Mood & Brooke 2010, 2012, in Other Internet Resources). \nGlobally, humans consume more\nthan 20 kg of fish per capita annually (FAO 2016). In the US, we\nconsume 1.5 lbs of honey per capita annually (Bee Culture 2016).\nEstimates of insect consumption are less sure. The UN FAO estimates\nthat insects are part of the traditional diets of two billion humans\nthough whether they are eaten\u2014whether those diets are adhered\nto\u2014and in what quantity is unclear (FAO 2013).\n\nSeafood is produced by farming and by fishing. Fishing techniques vary\nfrom a person using a line in a boat to large trawlers pulling nets\nacross the ocean floor. The arguments for and against seafood\nproduction are much like the arguments for and against meat\nproduction: Some worry about the effects on humans of these practices.\n(Some workers, for example, are enslaved on shrimpers.) Some worry\nabout the effects on the environment of these practices. (Some coral\nreefs, for example, are destroyed by trawlers.) Some worry about the\npermissibility of killing, hurting, or controlling sea creatures or\ntreating them merely as tools. This last worry should not be\nundersold: Again, Mood and Brooke (2010, 2012, in Other Internet\nResources) estimate that\nbetween 970 billion and 2.7 trillion fish are\nwild-caught yearly and between 37 and 120 billion farmed fish are\nkilled. If killing, hurting, or controlling these creatures or\ntreating them as mere tools is wrong, then the scale of our wrongdoing\nwith regard to sea creatures beggars belief.\n\nAre these actions wrong? Complicating the question is that there is\nsignificantly more doubt about which sea creatures have mental lives\nat all and what those mental lives are like. And while whether shrimp\nare sentient is clearly irrelevant to the permissibility of enslaving\nworkers who catch them, it does matter to the permissibility of\nkilling shrimp. This doubt is greater still with regard to insect\nmental lives. In conversation, people sometimes say that bee mental\nlife is such that nothing wrong is done to bees in raising them.\nNothing wrong is done to bees in killing them. Because they are not\nsentient, there is no hurting them. Because of these facts about bee\nmental life, the argument goes, \u201ctaking\u201d their honey need\nbe no more morally problematic than \u201ctaking\u201d apples from\nan apple tree. (There is little on the environmental impact of honey\nproduction or (human) workers and honey. So it is unclear how forceful\nenvironment- and human-based worries about honey are.)\n\nThis argument supporting honey production hinges on some empirical\nclaims about bee mental life. For an up-to-date assessment of bee\nmental life, see Tye 2016, which argues that bees \u201chave a rich\nperceptual consciousness\u201d and \u201ccan feel some\nemotions\u201d and that \u201cthe most plausible hypothesis\noverall\u2026is that bees feel pain\u201d (2016: 158\u2013159) and\nsee, too, Barron & Klein 2016, which argues that insects,\ngenerally, have a capacity for consciousness. The argument supporting\nhoney production might be objected to on those empirical grounds. It\nmight, instead, be objected to on the grounds that we are uncertain\nwhat the mental lives of bees are like. It could be that they are much\nricher than we realize. If so, killing them or taking excessive\nhoney\u2014and thereby causing them significant harms\u2014might\nwell be morally wrong. And, the objection continues, the costs of not\ndoing so, of just letting bees be, would be small. If so, caution\nrequires not taking any honey or killing bees or hurting them.\nArguments like this are sometimes put applied to larger creatures. For\ndiscussion of such arguments, see Guerrero 2007.\n",
