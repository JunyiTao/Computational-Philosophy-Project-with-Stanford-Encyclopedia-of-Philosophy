    "main_text": "What is Digital Art? || Digital Art: Production\n1.3 Digital Art: Production\n\nWhether or not a work of digital art is a work of representational\nart, and even with the most abstract works of digital art, there are\nlayers of representation involved in the complex processes of their\nproduction and presentation. Most of these layers, and arguably the\nmost important ones, are digital. Where there are analog systems\ninvolved, digital translation makes possible the realization of the\nvalues of the final work. This is perhaps best seen with paradigmatic\ncases of digital art. Consider the following two relatively early\nworks:\n\nCraig Kalpakjian, Corridor, 1995. Computer-generated\nanimation on laser video disc, in the collection of the San Francisco\nMuseum of Modern Art. The video leads us slowly down an empty office\nhallway that is slightly curved and evenly lit, with pale, blank walls\nand opaque glass windows.\nCory Arcangel and Paul B. Davis, Landscape Study #4,\n2002. Installation. A \u201creverse-engineered\u201d video game that\naims to transpose our everyday surroundings onto a video game\nplatform. The work \u201cplays\u201d on a Nintendo gaming system and\ndisplays a continuously scrolling landscape with the blocky,\nminimalist graphics of the Mario Bros. game.\n\n\nThe first of these works involves digital moving imagery that is\nentirely generated by a computer program. At the same time, the video\nlooks like it was or could have been recorded in an actual office\nsetting. The particular significance of the work depends on the viewer\nbeing aware of its digital composition while at the same time being\nstruck by its photorealistic familiarity. According to the San\nFrancisco Museum of Modern Art (SF MoMA),\n\n\nKalpakjian thus reveals the complete artificiality of the built\nenvironments we inhabit, and their aesthetic distance from more\nhumanistic forms. (SF MoMA n.d.)\n\n\nThe second work involves imagery that was initially captured\ndigitally. Arcangel & Davis began by taking 360-degree photographs\nof Buffalo, New York. They scanned and modified the photographs on\ntheir computer so that the images could be coded according to the\ngraphics capabilities of the Nintendo gaming system, and in order to\ngive the images the distinctive look and feel of the Mario\nBros. game. Arcangel & Davis then programmed the landscape\nimagery to scroll continuously across a TV screen, as in the Mario\nBros. game. Finally, Arcangel & Davis melted the chips in a\nSuper Mario cartridge, replacing them with their\nself-manufactured chips so that their landscape \u201cgame\u201d\ncould be run on any Nintendo system. As well as all the ways in which\nArcangel & Davis\u2019s work relies on both the technology and\naesthetics of videogames, there are clearly ways in which it\ndeliberately removes or blocks certain key features or capacities of\nvideogames, perhaps most notably their robust interactivity. Playing a\nvideogame essentially involves the prescribed creation of new display\ninstances of a work. But we do not \u201cplay\u201d Landscape\nStudy #4, and its imagery is fixed by the artist. The kind of\ninteractivity typical of videogames can also be found in artworks made\nwithout computers (see Lopes 2010: 49). But this type of interactivity\nis most closely associated with digital art because complex\ninteractivity is so much easier to achieve with the use of computers.\nThis suggests a high degree of self-consciousness in Arcangel &\nDavis\u2019s decision to block the interactivity of their\nreverse-engineered videogame. From the perspective of the philosophy\nof digital art, such a decision highlights the need for further\ndiscussion of the link between the nature of the digital and the\nnature of interactivity.\n\nWhat is it about the ways in which the works by Arcangel & Davis,\nand by Kalpakjian, are produced that makes them digital in an\nappreciatively relevant sense? Computer imaging depends on the\ninherent programmability and automation of digital computers. Digital\nimage capture depends on sampling and subsequently on the\nnear-instantaneous processes of discrete coding. None of this would be\npossible without a series of linked systems each with finitely\ndifferentiated settings.\n\nAt the most basic level, the myriad transistors in a computer are\nessentially tiny digital schemes, each with two types: the\n\u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d settings of the\ntransistor-capacitor switch. The settings are discrete and\ndistinguishable, as are their compliance classes, of 1s and 0s. The\nubiquity of binary code in computer processing is a consequence of the\nfact that a digital computer is essentially a vast collection of\non-off switches. A particular sequence of 1s and 0s realized at a\nparticular time in virtue of the requisite arrangement of transistors\nis a binary instance of a particular number, interchangeable with all\nother instances of the same number and not interchangeable with any\ninstances of different numbers. The difference between instances of\none number and instances of other numbers is strictly limited to the\ndifference in the ordering of 1s and 0s. In other words,\nGoodman\u2019s condition of finite differentiation is clearly met. In\nturn, the numbers can refer to other values, including the\nlight-intensity values of an image. A computation simply involves the\ngeneration of output strings of binary digits from input strings, in\naccordance with a general rule that depends on the properties of the\nstrings (Piccinini 2008). The modern (digital) computer encodes both\ninput data and assembly languages as sequences of binary digits, or\nbits, and allows for the internal storage of instructions. This makes\nthe computer essentially programmable in the sense that it can be\nmodified to compute new functions simply by being fed an appropriate\narrangement of bits.\n\nA program is a list of instructions, and instructions are strings of\ndigits. The modern digital computer has components that serve to copy\nand store programs inside the machine, and to supply instructions to\nthe computer\u2019s processing units for implementation in the\nappropriate order. The outputs of a system can be dependent on\nspecific inputs often in tandem with the conditional if-then\nstatements. This is what is involved in a\ncomputer executing conditional branching instructions such that it can\nmonitor and respond to its own intermediate computational states and\neven modify instructions based on its own processes. Such\nmodifications are dictated by an algorithm\u2014the program\u2019s\nset of rules and operations. It is the digital computer\u2019s\ncapacity for branching, due to its digital programmability, that\nallows for the kinds of higher-level automation involved in the use of\nimaging applications and sequential image-generation. Our artists,\nKalpakjian, and Arcangel & Davis, do not have to enter the strings\nof digits for every basic operation of the computer that underlies the\ncomplex operations involved in describing and manipulating images. If\nthey did have to do this, they would never finish making their\nartworks. Rather, artists can rely on open-source code, libraries, or\ncommercial software that automatically and instantaneously supplies\nthe lines of code required for the execution of their artistic\ndecisions.\n\nThe imaging software with which Kalpakjian works allows him to\ngenerate architectural interiors in rich detail. Arcangel & Davis\ndo not require as much from their imaging software given that they are\nmanipulating previously captured and scanned images. The process of\nscanning the photographs, just like the process involved in digital\nphotography, involves sampling and quantization of a visual source;\nassigning an integer, from a finite range, to the average\nlight-intensity measured across each small area of source-space\ncorresponding to a cell in a grid. This process involves averaging and\nrounding up values, and it involves measurement, or sampling, of light\nintensities at (spatially and temporally) discrete intervals. Some,\nindeed many, of the differences in light intensity across the source\nimage or scene (and at different times, in the case of moving imagery)\nare thereby dropped by the process of digital image-capture. Among\nsome media theorists, this fact has led to deep suspicion of the\ndigitally recorded image, prompting the feeling that the digital image\nis always a poor substitute for the analog. Current digital\ntechnologies for image-capture and display have such high rates of\nsampling frequency and resolution that the values dropped in\nquantization are well below the threshold of human perception. At the\nsame time, Arcangel & Davis\u2019s Landscape Study #4\nreminds us that digital artists may choose to exploit visible\npixellation for particular artistic ends.\n\nA digitally recorded image need not appear any less richly detailed or\nvaried in color than an analog image. All the same, in the terms of D.\nN. Rodowick, whereas the analog photograph is an \u201cisomorphic\ntranscription\u201d of its subject, a digital photograph is a\n\u201cdata-output\u201d, with a symbolically-mediated link to its\nsubject (Rodowick 2007: 117\u20138). This ontological\ndivide\u2014described by William J. Mitchell as a \u201csudden and\ndecisive rupture\u201d in the history of photography (1994: 59), is\nthen assumed to have aesthetic implications: Rodowick insists that the\n\u201cdiscontinuities\u201d in digital information \u201cproduce\nperceptual or aesthetic effects\u201d. Despite this insistence,\nhowever, Rodowick goes on to acknowledge that, with enough resolution,\n\u201ca digital photograph can simulate the look of a continuously\nproduced analogical image\u201d. This concession would seem to work\nagainst any attempt to identify the aesthetic effects of pixellation,\neven if \u201cthe pixel grid remains in the logical structure of the\nimage\u201d (Rodowick 2007: 119). But if we are to interpret Rodowick\ncharitably, he could be implying that ontology at least partly\ndetermines appropriate appreciation; even if a digital photograph can\nlook just like an analog photograph, its (known) digital status\naffects which of its perceptible features are aesthetically relevant\nand how we appropriately engage with them.\n",
