    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\nThe Arabic influence in logic is thinner than in other disciplines\n(apart from ethics), because only a few works of Arabic logic were\ntranslated into Latin. The most influential translations were the\nIsagoge part of Avicenna\u2019s summa The Healing\n(al-Shif\u0101\u02be) and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s\nIntentions of the Philosophers, the first part of which is a\nreworking of Avicennian logic. Ram\u00f3n Llull produced an Arabic\ncompendium of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s text, which he himself\ntranslated into Latin (Lohr 1965). To these sources one may add\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Enumeration of the Sciences,\nwhich transmitted much material on logical disciplines. Hermannus\nAlemannus\u2019 translation of Averroes\u2019 commentary on the\nPoetics was important because it remained the only source on\nAristotelian poetics available in the Middle Ages and had a rich\nmanuscript transmission (for its influence on Petrarch\u2019s\nnegative judgement about Arabic poetry see Burnett 1997). Other\ntranslated texts remained largely uninfluential, such as William of\nLuna\u2019s translations of five commentaries by Averroes on\nAristotle\u2019s logical works, or the Averroes translations made\nfrom Hebrew in the Renaissance. In sum, this means that the Latin West\nwas not aware of the more innovative parts of Arabic logic, such as in\nsyllogistics and modal logic (Street 2005).\n\nSeveral particular doctrines of Arabic logic, however, were very\ninfluential. Among them was Avicenna\u2019s theory of the subject\nmatter of logic, with its related doctrine of first and second\nintentions. Avicenna\u2019s basic claim is that logic deals with\nsecond-order concepts. This is discussed in the logic part of The\nHealing, but spelled out in technical vocabulary in the\nmetaphysics part (Metaphysics I,2): \u201cThe subject matter\nof logic is the secondary intelligible concepts\n(al-ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b al-ma\u02bfq\u016bla\nal-th\u0101niyya, intentiones intellectae secundo),\nwhich depend on the primary intelligible concepts with respect to the\nmanner by which one arrives through them at the unknown from the\nknown\u201d. In this sentence, \u201cconcept\u201d\n(ma\u02bfnan) is rendered in Latin with the term\nintentio.\n\nA brief note on this term is at place: In Arabic-Latin translation\nliterature, intentio is very often used to render\nma\u00b4nan, with the consequence that the term\nintentio took on a similarly broad semantic range as its\nArabic counterpart. In the writings of Avicenna, ma\u02bfnan\nmay mean \u201cconcept\u201d, but also \u201cmeaning\u201d of a\nword, or something \u201cintelligible\u201d by the intellect, or\n\u201cperceptible\u201d by estimation but not by the external senses\n(on estimation see section 5.1). In Averroes\u2019 epistemology, the\nterm ma\u02bfnan has a specific meaning as the object of\nmemory and a broader meaning as the abstracted content of sensory,\nimaginative or intelligible forms (Black 1996, 166).\n\nIn Avicenna\u2019s theory of logic, second intentions are defined as\nthe properties of concepts which these concepts acquire when used in\nattaining knowledge, for example: being a subject or being a\npredicate, being a premise or being a syllogism. Avicenna thus\nconfirms that logic has a proper subject matter, and hence becomes a\nfull-fledged part of philosophy, and not only a tool for the\nphilosophical disciplines (Sabra 1980, 752\u2013753).\nAvicenna\u2019s definition of logic appears already in Dominicus\nGundisalvi (De divisione philosophiae 150). Further Latin\nwriters to adopt Avicenna\u2019s thesis that the subject matter of\nlogic is second intentions are Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas,\nfollowed by many subsequent authors such as Pseudo-Robert Kilwardby,\nRadulphus Brito, Hervaeus Natalis, Peter Aureoli, Duns Scotus and\nWilliam of Ockham (Knudsen 1982; Maier\u00f9 1987; Perler 1994).\n\nIt was a matter of dispute how first and second intentions differ,\nwhat they refer to and what their ontological status is, a dispute\nbordering on epistemology and the philosophy of mind. Important\nparticipants in this discussion are Roger Bacon, who defines\nintentions as intelligible species, that is, mental likenesses of\nthings, and Hervaeus Natalis and Peter Aureoli, who (apart from\ndisagreeing on many issues) both hold that intentions are neither\nidentical with extramental things nor with qualities of the intellect;\nthey have their own \u201cintentional being\u201d (esse\nintentionale), which is the result of a cognitive act (Perler\n1994). This position was criticized both by nominalists and realists:\nthe nominalist William of Ockham objected against the reification of\nintentions and held that intentions are always natural signs in the\nmind; second intentions are natural signs which signify other natural\nsigns (Summa logicae I.12); the realist author Walter Burley\nrejects the idea of a special being of intentions and argues that\nsecond intentions are part of extramental reality (Knudsen 1982).\nLogic as the science of second intentions continued to be a\nphilosophical topic well into the sixteenth century, especially among\nThomists and Scotist authors.\n",
