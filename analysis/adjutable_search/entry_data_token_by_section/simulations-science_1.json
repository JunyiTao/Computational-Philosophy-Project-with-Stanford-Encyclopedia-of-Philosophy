    "main_text": "What is Computer Simulation? || A Broad Definition\n1.2 A Broad Definition\n\n\nMore broadly, we can think of computer simulation as a comprehensive\nmethod for studying systems. In this broader sense of the term, it\nrefers to an entire process. This process includes choosing\na model; finding a way of implementing that model in a form that can be\nrun on a computer; calculating the output of the algorithm; and\nvisualizing and studying the resultant data. The method includes\nthis entire process\u2014used to make inferences about the target\nsystem that one tries to model\u2014as well as the procedures used to\nsanction those inferences. This is more or less the definition of\ncomputer simulation studies in Winsberg 2003 (111).\n\u201cSuccessful simulation studies do more than compute numbers. They\nmake use of a variety of techniques to draw inferences from these\nnumbers. Simulations make creative use of calculational\ntechniques that can only be motivated extra-mathematically and\nextra-theoretically. As such, unlike simple computations that can be\ncarried out on a computer, the results of simulations are not\nautomatically reliable. Much effort and expertise goes into deciding\nwhich simulation results are reliable and which are not.\u201d \nWhen philosophers of science write about computer simulation, and make\nclaims about what epistemological or methodological properties\n\u201ccomputer simulations\u201d have, they usually mean the term to\nbe understood in this broad sense of a computer simulation\nstudy. \n",
