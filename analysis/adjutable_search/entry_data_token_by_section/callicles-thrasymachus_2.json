    "main_text": "Callicles\n4. Callicles\n\nNothing is known of any historical Callicles, and, if there were one,\nit is odd that such a forceful personality would have left no trace in\nthe historical record. All we can say on the basis of the\nGorgias itself is that he is an Athenian aristocrat with\npolitical ambitions and personal connections to Gorgias. E.R. Dodds\nnotes that, given Plato\u2019s usual practices, \u201cthe\nprobabilities are strongly against\u201d Callicles\u2019 being\nsimply a literary invention (1959, 12); but as Dodds also remarks, it\nis tempting to see in Callicles a fragment of Plato himself\u2014a\nfrightening vision, perhaps, of what he might have become without\nSocrates (1959, 14). At any rate the Gorgias repeatedly marks\nhim as a kind of antithesis or double to Socrates as the paradigmatic\nphilosopher. Socrates opens their debate with a somewhat jokey survey\nof how much the two have in common (481c\u2013d); they later exchange\nspeeches arguing for their diametrically opposed ways of life, with\nrepeated allusions to the contrasted brothers Zethus and Amphion in\nEuripides\u2019 play Antiope (485e, 486d, 489e, 506b). These\ndramatic touches express the philosophical reality: more than any\nother character in Plato, Callicles is Socrates\u2019 philosophical\nantithesis and polar opposite.\n\nCallicles\u2019 version of the immoralist challenge turns out to\ninvolve four main components, which I will discuss in order: (1) a\ncritique of conventional justice, (2) a positive account of\n\u2018justice according to nature\u2019, (3) a theory of the\nvirtues, and (4) a hedonistic conception of the good.\n\n(1) Conventional Justice: Callicles\u2019 critique of conventional\njustice emerges from his diagnosis of the orator Polus\u2019 failure\nin the preceding argument. Polus had accused Gorgias of succumbing to\nshame in assenting to Socrates\u2019 suggestion that he would teach\njustice to any student ignorant of it; Callicles accuses Polus of\nsuccumbing to shame himself, and being tricked by Socrates, whose\narguments equivocate between natural and conventional values.\nAccording to convention [nomos], doing injustice is more\nshameful than suffering it, as Polus allowed; but \u201cby nature all\nthat is worse is also more shameful, like suffering what\u2019s\nunjust\u201d (483a, tr. here and throughout Zeyl, sometimes revised).\nCallicles locates the origins of the convention in a conspiracy of the\nweak: \u201cthe people who institute our laws are the weak and the\nmany\u2026 they assign praise and blame with themselves and their\nown advantage in mind\u201d (483b). This diagnosis of ordinary moral\nlanguage as a mask for self-interest is reminiscent of Thrasymachus;\nbut there is also a contrast, for Thrasymachus presented the laws as\nadapted to serve the strong, i.e., the rulers. Callicles is perhaps\nmore narrowly focussed on democratic societies, which he depicts as\ninvolving the tyranny of the weak many over exceptional individuals.\nThe many \u201cmold the best and the most powerful among us \u2026\nand with charms and incantations we subdue them into slavery, telling\nthem that one is supposed to get no more than his fair share\u201d\n(483e\u2013484a). This rhetorically powerful critique of justice\ninaugurates a durable philosophical tradition: Nietzsche, Foucault,\nand their successors in various projects of genealogy and\n\u2018unmasking\u2019 are all Callicles\u2019 heirs. \n\n(2) Natural Justice: Callicles\u2019 denunciation of conventional\njustice is bound up with a ringing endorsement of its opposite, the\njust \u2018according to nature\u2019; in fact his opening speech is\nperhaps our most important text for the sophistic contrast between\nnature [phusis] and convention [nomos].\nNomos is, as noted above (in section 1), first and foremost\nLaw in all its grandeur, attributed by Hesiod to the will of Zeus. But\nin sophistic contexts, nomos is often used to designate some\nnorm or institution\u2014language, religion, moral values, law\nitself\u2014as merely a matter of social construction. That is why\nnomos varies from polis to polis and nation\nto nation, and can be changed by our decisions. What is by nature, by\ncontrast, is a kind of ethical and political \u2018given\u2019,\noutrunning our wishes or beliefs; and the contrast involves at least\nan implicit privileging of nature as inherently authoritative (see\nKerferd 1981a, Chapter 10). This project of disentangling the\ncontributions of nature and convention in human life can be seen as an\nextension to the human realm of Presocratic natural science, with its\nattempts to identify the eternal explanatory first principles\n[archai] behind the ever-changing, diverse phenomena of the\ncosmos.\n\nThe implications of the nomos-phusis contrast always depend\non how the \u2018natural\u2019 is understood. Callicles looks both\nto international politics and to the animal world to identify what is\nnatural rather than conventional: \u201cboth among the other animals\nand in whole cities and races of men, it [nature] shows that this is\nwhat justice has been decided to be: that the superior rule the\ninferior and have a greater share than they\u201d (483d). He adds two\nexamples at the level of \u2018cities and races\u2019: the invasions\nof Greece by the Persian Emperor Xerxes, and of Scythia by his father\nDarius (483d\u2013e). He also imagines an individual within society who\nwould exercise superiority to the full: if a man of outsize ability\nmanages to throw off our moralistic shackles, \u201che would rise up\nand be revealed as our master, and here the justice of nature would\nshine forth\u201d (484a\u2013b). So what the justice of nature amounts to\nis simple: it is for the superior man to appropriate the power and\npossessions of the inferior (484c). Thus Callicles\u2019 genealogy of\nmorals, like Glaucon\u2019s in Republic II, presents\npleonexia as an eternal and universal first principle of\nhuman nature; and he goes further than either Thrasymachus or Glaucon\nin taking this nature as the basis for a positive norm.\n\nFor all its ranting sound, Callicles has a straightforward and\nlogically valid argument here: (1) observation of nature can disclose\nthe content of \u2018natural justice\u2019; (2) nature is to be\nobserved in the realms where moral conventions have no hold, viz among\nstates and among animals; (3) such observation discloses the\ndomination and exploitation of the weak by the strong; (4) therefore,\nit is natural justice for the strong to rule over and have more than\nthe weak. From a modern point of view, premise (1) is likely to appear\nthe most dubious, for it violates the plausible principle, most\nfamously advanced by David Hume, that no normative claims may be\ninferred from purely descriptive premises (\u2018no ought from an\nis\u2019). But then, legitimate or not, this kind of appeal to nature\nruns through almost all of ancient ethics: it is central to the moral\ntheory of Plato himself, as well as Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the\nStoics. So Socrates\u2019 objection is instead to (2) and (3):\nCallicles gets nature wrong. In truth, Socrates insists later on,\n\u201cpartnership and friendship, orderliness, self-control, and\njustice hold together heaven and earth, and gods and men, and that is\nwhy they call this universe a world order, my friend, and not an\nundisciplined world-disorder\u201d (507e\u2013508a). Callicles advocates\npleonexia only because he \u2018neglects geometry\u2019\n(508a): instead of predatory animals, we should observe and emulate\nthe orderly structure of the cosmos as a whole.\n\n(3) Callicles\u2019 theory of the virtues: As with Thrasymachus,\nSocrates\u2019 response is to press Callicles regarding the deeper\ncommitments on which his views depend. He first prods Callicles to\narticulate the conception of the \u2018superior\u2019 which his\naccount of natural justice involves. Callicles has said that nature\nreveals that it is just for the \u2018superior\u2019,\n\u2018better\u2019 or \u2018stronger\u2019 to have more: but who\nare they (488b\u2013c)? In practice, as Socrates points out, \u2018the\nmany\u2019, whom Callicles has condemned as weak, are in fact\nstronger: they are able, as Callicles himself has complained, to\nsuppress the gifted few. So, like Thrasymachus when faced with the\nfact that rulers sometimes make mistakes in the pursuit of\nself-interest, Callicles now has to distinguish the\n\u2018strength\u2019 he admires from actual political power. (This\nleaves it unclear whether and why we should still see the invasions of\nDarius and Xerxes as examples of the \u2018strong\u2019 exercising\nthe \u2018justice of nature\u2019; since both their expeditions were\nnotorious failures, the examples are rather perplexing anyway.)\n\nCallicles goes on to articulate (with some help from Socrates) a\nconception of \u2018superiority\u2019 in terms of a pair of very\ntraditional sounding virtues: intelligence [phron\u00easis],\nparticularly about the affairs of the city, and courage\n[andreia], which makes men \u201ccompetent to accomplish\nwhatever they have in mind, without slackening off because of softness\nof spirit\u201d (491a\u2013b). These are the familiar\n\u2018functional\u2019 virtues of the Homeric warrior, and the claim\nthat such a man should be rewarded with a \u2018greater share\u2019\nis no sophistic novelty but a restatement of the Homeric warrior\nethic: the best fighter in the battle of the day deserves the best cut\nof the meat at night. At the same time, Callicles is interestingly\nreluctant to describe his \u2018superior\u2019 man as possessing the\nvirtue of justice [dikaiosun\u00ea], which we might have\nexpected him to redefine as conformity to the justice of nature.\nInstead, he seems to dispense with any conception of justice as a\nvirtue; and he explicitly rejects the fourth traditional virtue which\nPlato will take as canonical in the Republic,\ns\u00f4phrosun\u00ea, temperance or moderation.\n\nThis traditional side of Calliclean \u2018natural justice\u2019 is\nworth emphasising, since Callicles is often read as a representative\nof the sophistic movement and their subversive \u2018modern\u2019\nideas. (Nietzsche, for instance, discusses the sophists\u2014with\nimmense admiration\u2014in a way that is hard to make sense of\nunless we take Callicles as a principal source (1968, 232\u20134; and\nsee Dodds 1958, 386\u201391, on Callicles\u2019 influence on\nNietzsche\u2019s own thought).) Despite Callicles\u2019 opposition\nof nomos and phusis, and his association with\nGorgias, this reading is somewhat misleading. Callicles is clearly not\na professional sophist himself\u2014indeed Socrates mentions that\nhe despises them (520b). And his friend Gorgias is properly speaking a\nrhetorician, i.e. a teacher of public speaking\u2014presumably a\nmore practical, less intellectually pretentious (and so, to Callicles,\nmore manly) line of work. Most of all, the work to which Callicles\nputs the trendy nomos-phusis distinction is essentially\ntraditional: his position is a somewhat feral variant on the ancient\nelitist tradition in Greek moral thought, found for instance in\nTheognis as well as Homer\u2019s warrior ethic. \n\n(4) Hedonism: Once the \u2018strong\u2019 have been identified as a\nruthlessly intelligent and daring natural elite, a second point of\nclarification arises: of what, exactly, do they deserve more? Socrates\nalready pressed the point at the outset by, in his usual fashion,\nposing it in the lowliest terms: should the stronger have a greater\nshare of food and drink, or clothes, or land? These suggestions are\nscornfully rejected at first (490c\u2013d); but Callicles does in the end\nallow that eating and drinking, and even scratching or the life of a\ncatamite (a boy or youth who makes himself constantly available to a\nman for the man\u2019s sexual pleasure), count as instances of the\nappetitive fulfilment he recommends (494b\u2013e). \n\nSo it is not made clear to us what pleasures Callicles himself had in\nmind\u2014perhaps he himself is hazy on that point. All he says is\nthat the superior man must \u201callow his own appetites to get as\nlarge as possible and not restrain them. And when they are as large as\npossible, he ought to be competent to devote himself to them by virtue\nof his courage and intelligence, and to fill him with whatever he may\nhave an appetite for at the time\u201d (491e\u2013492a). This seems to\nleave the content of those appetites entirely a matter of subjective\npreference. And Callicles eventually allows himself, without much\nresistance, to be committed by Socrates to a simple and extreme form\nof hedonism: all pleasures are good and pleasure is the good\n(495a\u2013e). Their arguments over this thesis stand at the start of a\nfascinating and complex Greek debate over the nature and value of\npleasure, which is here understood as the \u2018filling\u2019 or\n\u2018replenishment\u2019 of some painful lack (e.g., the pleasure\nof drinking is a replenishment in relation to the pain of thirst).\nHowever, it is difficult to be sure how much this discussion tells us\nabout Callicles, since it is Socrates who elaborates the conception of\npleasure as replenishment on which it depends. Even the strength of\nCallicles\u2019 commitment to the hedonistic equation of pleasure and\nthe good is uncertain. At 499b, having been refuted by Socrates, he\ncasually allows that some pleasures are better than others; and as\nnoted above, hedonism was introduced in the first place not as a\nthesis he was keen to propound, but as the answer to a question he\ncould not avoid\u2014viz, the stronger should \u2018have\nmore\u2019 of what? Callicles\u2019 philosophical\nenthusiasm is not, it seems, for pleasure itself but for the\nintensity, self-assertion and extravagance that accompany its pursuit\non a grand scale: he endorses hedonism so as to repudiate the\nrestraints of temperance, rather than the other way around. One way to\nunderstand this rather oddly structured position is, again, as\ninspired by the Homeric tradition. Callicles\u2019 somewhat murky\nideal, the superior man, is imagined as having the arrogant grandeur\nof the larger-than-life Homeric heroes; but what this new breed of\nhero is supposed to fight for and be rewarded by remains cloudy to his\nimagination.\n",
