    "main_text": "How to Characterize Quotation || Quotation Identified Syntactically\n1.2 Quotation Identified Syntactically\n\nA syntactic characterization might go something like this:\nTake two quotation marks\u2014 single apostrophes in Britain, double\nin the United States, double angles in parts of Europe \u2014 and\nput, for example, a letter, a word, or a sentence between the two.\nWhat results is a quotation, as in (4)\u2013(5). But then consider\nthe following sentences:\n\n(6)\nMy name is Donald.\n(7)\nBachelor has eight letters.\n\n\nWe can see there are two problems with the syntactic\ncharacterization:\n\nIn spoken language, no obvious correlates of quotation marks\nexist. Spoken utterances of (6) seem often to be\nunaccompanied by lexical items corresponding to\n\u2018quote/unquote\u2019.\nEven if attention is restricted to written language, quotation is\nnot invariably indicated by the use of quotation marks. Sometimes, for\nexample, italicization is used instead, as in (7).\n\n\nOther devices employed as substitutes for quotation marks include bold\nface, indentation, and line indentation (cf. Quine 1940, pp.\n23\u201324; Geach 1957, p. 82). There\u2019s no clear limit on the\nrange of distinct written options, other than that they are used as\nquotation marks, but this renders the syntactic characterization\nincomplete, and thus, unsatisfactory.\n",
