    "main_text": "Explanation, Prediction, Retrodiction\n5. Explanation, Prediction, Retrodiction\n\nHempel\u2019s critics\u2014both early and late\u2014have not always\nshown an appreciation for the full dimensions of his explication.\nMichael Scriven (1959), for example, once objected to \u201cthe\ndeductive model, with its syllogistic form, where no student of\nelementary logic could fail to complete the inference, given the\npremise\u201d (1959: 462), when no restriction is placed on the\ncomplexity of the relevant laws or the intricacy of these deductions\n(Hempel 1965c: 339). Similar objections have been lodged more recently\nby William Bechtel and Adele Abrahamsen (2005), for example, who\nclaim, in defense of \u201cthe mechanist alternative\u201d, that,\namong its many benefits,\n\n\ninvestigators are not limited to linguistic representations and\nlogical inference in presenting explanations but frequently employ\ndiagrams and reasoning about mechanisms by simulating them. (2005:\n421)\n\n\nHempel\u2019s conditions of adequacy, however, are capable of\nsatisfaction without their presentation as formal arguments.\n\nHempel remarks that his model of explanation does not directly apply\nto the wordless gesticulations of a Yugoslavian automobile mechanic or\nguarantee that explanations that are adequate are invariably\nsubjectively satisfying. His purpose was to formalize the conditions\nthat must be satisfied when an explanation is adequate without denying\nthat background knowledge and prior beliefs frequently make a\ndifference in ordinary conversational contexts. Jan might not know\nsome of the antecedent conditions, Jim might have misunderstood the\ngeneral laws, or features of the explanandum event may have been\nmissed by them both. Even when information is conveyed using diagrams\nand simulations, for example, as long as it satisfies conditions\n (CA-1)\n through\n (CA-4)\u2014no\n matter whether those conditions are satisfied implicitly or\nexplicitly\u2014an adequate scientific explanation is at hand. But it\nhas to satisfy all four of those requirements.\n\nDemonstrating that an adequate scientific explanation is at hand,\nhowever, imposes demands beyond the acquisition of information about\ninitial conditions and laws. In the examiner\u2019s sense of\nknowledge Ian Hacking identified (Hacking 1967: 319), to prove an\nadequate scientific explanation is available, it would be necessary to\nshow that each of Hempel\u2019s adequacy conditions has been\nsatisfied. It would not be enough to show, say, that one person is\nknowledgeable about the initial conditions, another about the covering\nlaws, and a third about the explanandum. It would be necessary to show\nthat the explanandum can be derived from the explanans, that those\nlaws were required for the derivation, and that the initial conditions\nwere those present on that occasion.\n (CA-1)\u2013(CA-4)\n qualifies as a \u201ccheck list\u201d to insure that a scientific\nexplanation is adequate.\n",
