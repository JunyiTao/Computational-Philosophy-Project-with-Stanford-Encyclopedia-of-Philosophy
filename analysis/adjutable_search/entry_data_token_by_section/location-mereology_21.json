Given the symmetry and\ntransitivity of identity, it also yields an argument against the\npossibility of multilocated material objects. Since, necessarily, a\nmaterial object is identical to each of its exact locations, and since\nnothing can be identical to two different entities, no material object\ncan have two different exact locations.\n\nThis leaves open the possibility of multilocation for entities (e.g.,\nuniversals) that are not material objects. This possibility is ruled\nout by Supersubstantivalism+, according to which it is necessary that\nany entity is identical to anything at which it is exactly\nlocated.\n",
