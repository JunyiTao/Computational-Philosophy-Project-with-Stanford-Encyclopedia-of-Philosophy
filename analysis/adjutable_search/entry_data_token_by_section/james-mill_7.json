    "main_text": "The Essay on Government || Macaulay\u2019s \u201cFamous Attack\u201d\n4.4 Macaulay\u2019s \u201cFamous Attack\u201d\nAlways the critic, Mill was himself a frequent target of criticism, much of which came from quarters hostile to the kinds of sweeping reforms favored by Bentham and the philosophic radicals. Mill\u2019s Essay on Government first appeared in 1820, and was subsequently reprinted in editions of his Essays in 1823, 1825, and 1828, which reached an ever wider audience, including (Mill boasted) \u201cthe young men of the Cambridge Union.\u201d Fearing that the cause of moderate reform was in danger from Mill and the philosophic radicals, Whig polemicists weighed in against Mill. One of them, Sir James Mackintosh (1765\u20131832), was an old Whig stalwart with a plodding and ofttimes pompous prose style. The other, T. B. Macaulay (1800\u20131859), was a much younger and altogether more formidable foe.\nMacaulay\u2019s \u201cMill on Government,\u201d published in the March 1829 issue of The Edinburgh Review, is a remarkable mixture of logical criticism, irony, mordant wit, and droll parody. That Mill\u2019s Essay on Government is remembered at all today doubtless owes something to Macaulay\u2019s memorable critique. The most remarkable feature of Macaulay\u2019s critique is that it seems to be largely aloof from particular political issues, focusing instead on what we would nowadays call methodological matters. Against his older adversary the twenty-eight-year-old Macaulay defends the \u201chistorical\u201d or \u201cinductive\u201d approach to the study of politics against Mill\u2019s abstract, ahistorical, and \u201cdeductive\u201d method. Macaulay maintains that we learn more from \u201cexperience\u201d than from \u201ctheory,\u201d and had best beware of the simplifications and \u201csophisms\u201d to be found in Mill\u2019s Essay on Government. The most pernicious of these is the \u201claw\u201d that men act always on the basis of self-interest. This law, Macaulay counters, is either trivially true (because logically circular) or patently false; in either case it hardly suffices as a foundation upon which to erect an argument for radical reform, much less a comprehensive theory of politics. And if Mill\u2019s deductive logic fails, the entire edifice\u2014including his supposedly \u201cscientific\u201d arguments in favor of radical reform\u2014collapses with it (Macaulay 1992).\nThat James Mill, fierce polemicist that he was, did not respond quickly and with no holds barred seems surprising, to say the least. His eldest son offers one possible explanation. In his Autobiography J. S. Mill remarks that \u201cI was not at all satisfied with the mode in which my father met the criticisms of Macaulay. He did not, as I thought he ought to have done, justify himself by saying, \u2018I was not writing a scientific treatise on polities. I was writing an article for parliamentary reform\u2019. He treated Macaulay\u2019s argument as simply irrational; an attack upon the reasoning faculty; an example of the saying of Hobbes, that when reason is against a man, a man will be against reason (J.S. Mill 1873, 165, 167).\u201d\nYet the younger Mill\u2019s account of his father\u2019s reaction to Macaulay\u2019s \u201cfamous attack\u201d (as the son later described it) is misleading in at least two respects. In the first place, James Mill did not, and given his own premises could not, distinguish between a \u201cscientific treatise on politics\u201d and a coherent and compelling argument for \u201cparliamentary reform.\u201d For he believed that any reforms that were workable and worth having could be based only on an adequately scientific theory of politics. The Essay on Government was intended to be both, if only in brief outline. Moreover, the younger Mill leaves the impression that his father, although angered by the attack, never replied to Macaulay. But this is untrue.\nFor a time James Mill tried, without success, to persuade his friend and fellow Benthamite Etienne Dumont to reply to \u201cthe curly-headed coxcomb, who only abuses what he does not understand\u201d (Mill to Dumont, 1829b). In the meantime there appeared Sir James Mackintosh\u2019s Dissertation on Ethical Philosophy (1830) in which Mill\u2019s Essay on Government was singled out for special censure. There was nothing new in this; but what caught Mill\u2019s eye was that Mackintosh\u2019s mode and manner of argument was borrowed, as the author acknowledged, from \u201cthe writer of a late criticism on Mr. Mill\u2019s Essay.\u2014See Edinburgh Review, No. 97, March 1829.\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d says Mill with evident relish, \u201cis convenient; because the answer, which does for Sir James, will answer the same purpose with the Edinburgh Review\u201d (Mill 1992, 305). Of course, the \u201cwriter of a late criticism\u201d to whom Mackintosh refers was none other than Macaulay, whom the elder Mill then proceeds to answer in the guise of replying to Mackintosh.\nIn his reply Mill reiterates and defends the arguments advanced in his Essay on Government: all men\u2014including rulers and representatives\u2014are moved mainly if not exclusively by considerations of self-interest, and therefore the only security for good government is to be found in making the interests of representatives identical with those of their constituents. But, unlike the cool, detached, and ostensibly deductive Essay on Government, Mill\u2019s reply contains a good deal of vitriol. He writes like a schoolmaster who, having lost all patience with a slow-witted pupil, is content to ridicule him before his cleverer classmates. The sight is not a pretty one, and shows James Mill at his polemical worst. Whether, or to what extent, such a splenetic rejoinder could suffice as a refutation is surely questionable.\n",
