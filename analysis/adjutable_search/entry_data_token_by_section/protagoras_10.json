    "main_text": "Protagoras\u2019 Political Thought || Protagoras on justice and law\n5.3 Protagoras on justice and law\n\nThe emphasis on the political dimension can be paralleled with the\nso-called Protagoras\u2019 \u201cApology\u201d in the\nTheaetetus\u2014the problem of the compatibility between\nthis dialogue and the Protagoras is one of the most urgent\nproblems in Protagoras\u2019 scholarship. In the myth, it is only\nstated that human beings, insofar as they are human beings, have a\npredisposition towards justice (dike). In the\n\u201cApology\u201d (and partly in the second part of\nProtagoras\u2019 speech in the Protagoras), there are not\nonly individual decisions at stake but also collective ones. In the\nlatter case the discussion is about the law (nomos), which\ndepends on human decisions and can be modified according to the\ncircumstances \n\n\nwhatever seems [or: is decreed to be, dokein] just and fine\nto each city also is that for it, so long as it thinks [or:\nadopt this law, nomizein]. (80A21a DK) \n\n\nThese two claims can be easily recombined by arguing that the law is\nthe concrete actualisation of the human predisposition towards\njustice.\n\nWhat is more controversial is how the apparent relativism of the\n\u201cApology\u201d can be read into the myth and how it can be\nreconciled with its emphasis on the \u201cnaturalistic\u201d notion\nof justice in the myth. But the tension is probably more apparent than\nreal, for in the myth it is not said that justice can be developed in\none sense only, and the notion of \u201cuseful\u201d, which plays an\nimportant role in both dialogues, paves the way for a consistent\nreading of the two testimonies. Indeed, nomos is not the\nresult of arbitrary decisions but depends on objective situations. But\nsince situations and contexts are different and what is useful varies\nfrom context to context (cf. Protagoras 333e\u2013334c), thus\nnomos also varies. Once again, more than\n\u201crelativism\u201d it is \u201cpluralism\u201d (according to\nwhich the variety of human laws depends on the complexity of reality)\nthat seems to better describe Protagoras\u2019 view. The joint\nreading of the two texts produces therefore something like the\nfollowing: human beings have a predisposition towards justice, which\nis what will enable them to live a prosperous life (the alternative,\nwithout justice, would be conflict and use of force like in the animal\nworld, see below,\n \u00a75.4,\n the reference to Hesiod in the myth); justice, insofar as it is the\ncondition for social life, is in the interest of human beings.\nConcretely speaking, this predisposition towards justice will find its\nactualisation in specific laws, which promote an advantageous\nrelationship with reality. But since reality is complex and unstable,\nlaws can be accordingly modified. The task of the politician (and the\nsophist) is therefore to promote the interest of the political\ncommunity (polis) in any given situation by establishing the\nright (that is, advantageous) laws \n\n\nthe clever and competent orators [i.e., those who publicly discuss\npolitical matters, hence politicians and sophists] make good things\nseem to be just to cities instead of bad ones. (80A21a DK) \n\n\nRemarkably, this conclusion perfectly fits with what Protagoras argues\nin both dialogues by insisting on the importance of competent and\nexpert teachers.\n\nAll in all, Protagoras appears as one of the first supporters of a\nconventionalist notion of justice (Neschke-Hentschke 1995:\n56\u201359; Bonazzi 2020: 67\u201368). Law and justice coincide: the\njust is what is established by law, which is the result of human\ndecisions, a set of rules that men establish together. Interestingly,\nit is precisely this kind of conventionalist account of justice and\nthe relation between nomos and the useful that will be\nobjects of heated debates in the second half of the fifth century BCE,\nmost notably among the sophists (see Antiphon 87B44 DK, significantly\nfrom a treatise entitled Truth,\nXenophon, Memorabilia Book I, Ch. 40\u201346, Callicles in\nPlato\u2019s Gorgias 483b\u2013484b, Thrasymachus in\nPlato\u2019s Republic 338c\u2013339a,\nThucydides History V 84\u2013105).\n",
