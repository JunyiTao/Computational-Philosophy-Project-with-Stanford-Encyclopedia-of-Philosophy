    "main_text": "Method and Metaphysics in the Statesman || The Statesman and the Herdsman\n7.1 The Statesman and the Herdsman\n\n\nThe Statesman embarks on its division without a new paradigm.\nApparently the angler from the previous dialogue serves as a viable\nguide for the method of dichotomous division itself. As we noted in\n\u00a7 3.1, the Statesman opens its investigation with a\ncollection of kinds (king, statesman, household manager, slave-owner)\nthat share salient features in common, and this collection allows a crude\ndescription of the kind to be defined, which guides the inquiry. Since\ninstances of the target kind can direct and control other people by\nmeans of their understanding without physical manipulation, the\nStranger starts his division from the wide kind knowledge and\nimmediately divides it into practical and theoretical, and then looks\nfor the statesman down the branch originating from theoretical\nknowledge. The opening division takes place in two stages\u2014a\nfirst stage focusing on the statesman\u2019s knowledge, followed by a\nlecture on method, and a second stage focusing on the object of that\nknowledge. Both phases of the division are peculiar but in different\nways.\n\n\nConsider stage one. Having set off down the theoretical branch of\nknowledge in search for the statesman, the Stranger divides\ntheoretical knowledge into two sub-kinds. One kind recognizes\ndifference, judges things recognized and then leaves off (the art of\ncalculation is here); the other kind recognizes difference and judges\nthings recognized, and then directs on the basis of that judgment\n(statecraft is here) (Statesman 259d\u2013260c). Directing\nsuggests practical, if not hands-on, knowledge, so keep in mind that\npractical knowledge was marked off from theoretical knowledge and\nabandoned at the start. Next he divides directive knowledge into two\nsorts, of which one passes on the directions of others (heralds are\nhere), while the other passes on its own directions for the sake of\ngeneration (the statesman is here) (Statesman\n260c\u2013261b). Knowledge for the sake of generation/production\nagain suggests practical expertise, and the statesman\u2019s knowledge\nlooks ever more practical as the division continues. At the next\ndivision one kind passes on its own directions to generate inanimate\nthings (the master-builder belongs here), while the other does so to\ngenerate animate things (the statesman belongs here)\n(Statesman 261b\u2013d). The Stranger then divides this\nlatter kind into those who generate and rear single animate things\n(ox-drivers and grooms are here), and those who generate and rear them\nin herds (the statesman and herdsman are here) (Statesman\n261d). Once the statesman merges with the herdsman, the theoretical\nbranch has become thoroughly mixed up with the practical branch\noriginally discarded, since the knowledge of horse-breeders, cowherds,\nshepherds, and swineherds is practical and scarcely theoretical. No\nwonder the statesman will prove to have company at the terminus:\nfarmers, millers, physical trainers, doctors, and other experts also\ntake care of practical aspects of human life (Statesman\n267e\u2013268a).\n\n\nAt the end of the first stage of the division, when the inquirers have\nreached herd-rearing, the Stranger invites Young Socrates to make the\nnext division himself. By now the boy sees where the division is\nheading and proposes to mark off the rearing of humans (statecraft)\nfrom the rearing of other animals (ordinary herding)\n(Statesman 262a). The Stranger stops him, objecting that such\na division is like dividing the human race into Greek and barbarian:\nbarbarian is not a proper kind because its members share only a\nnegative feature, being non-Greek speakers. The mistake is like\nmarking off all numbers other than 10,000 (Statesman\n262c\u2013263a). The Stranger advises Young Socrates to divide\nthrough the middle of things and not break off one small part from a\nlarge part without a form (e.g., he should divide number into even and\nodd, and human into male and female [Statesman\n262e]). Someone hoping to encounter forms should, he says, make\ndivisions into parts that also have a form (Statesman\n262a\u2013c).\n\n\nAlthough the Stranger admits that he is wandering from the topic and\nshould put off discussion of method until another occasion, he tarries\na little longer to give a lecture on the difference between mere parts\nof a kind and parts that are themselves genuine kinds\n(Statesman 263b). Apparently, real kinds include only members\nwith some positive feature in common, while other parts allow members\nsharing only a negative feature. Scholars have taken the Stranger\u2019s\nlecture very seriously as indicating Plato\u2019s views about proper\nprocedure and the metaphysics on which division relies, and they\nappeal especially to Plato\u2019s Phaedrus, where the elder\nSocrates announces that someone engaging in correct procedure should\ndivide kinds at their natural joints, not hack off bits like a bad\nbutcher (Phaedrus 265e) (see Moravcsik 1973, Cohen 1973, and\nWedin 1987). Before we assess Young Socrates\u2019 mistake and the\nStranger\u2019s lecture, we ought to consider the second stage of the\ndivision, since it purports to demonstrate correct procedure.\n\n\nFirst the visitor retraces his steps and points out that in speaking\nof rearing animate things, he and Young Socrates had already in effect\ndivided living creatures into wild and tame (Statesman\n264a). All rearing deals with tame animals, and some of that rearing\ndevotes itself to tame animals in herds. He then divides herd-rearing\ninto aquatic and terrestrial (the branch he pursues), next marks off\nthe winged from the footed (the branch he pursues), then the horned\n(oxen, sheep) from the hornless (the branch he pursues), then the\ninterbreeding (horses, donkeys) from the non-interbreeding (the branch\nhe pursues), and finally the four-footed (just pigs are left) from the\ntwo-footed (humans). He now defines statecraft as rearing the\ntwo-footed, non-interbreeding, hornless, terrestrial, tame herd:\nhumans (Statesman 267a\u2013c).\n\n\nThis division has given Platonic division a bad name, and there is\nmuch to query (see Dorter 1994: 181\u201391), but perhaps the most\nobviously dubious move comes at the end: according to the division,\nthe swineherd has more in common with the statesman than with the\ncowherd and shepherd. Later in the dialogue the visitor says that the\nstatesman differs from all other herdsman (including the swineherd) in\na crucial respect. No one disputes with the cowherd his claim to look\nafter all aspects of the life of his herd\u2014he rears them; he is\ntheir doctor, their match-maker, their breeder and trainer\u2014and\nthe same is true of all other herdsmen, with one exception: the\nherdsman of humans, the statesman. In his case alone many rivals\ncompete for the title of caretaker\u2014farmers produce their food,\ndoctors cure their diseases, physical trainers guide their exercise,\nand other experts attend to other human needs (Statesman\n267e\u2013268d). Given this difference, would it not have been better\nto distinguish humans from other herded animals at the outset, as\nYoung Socrates proposed?\n\n\nYoung Socrates\u2019 division into the herding of humans and the herding of\nother animals seems in retrospect to have considerable merit and\nindeed to apply two lessons from earlier in the day (cf. \u00a7 6.1\nabove). First, the Stranger said in the Sophist that parts of\nknowledge derive their names from the objects they are set over\n(Sophist 257c\u2013d), and that claim justifies identifying\nstatecraft\u2014a mode of herding\u2014as human herding. Second, a\nnegation specifies the complement of a form within a wider kind, and\nthat thesis justifies distinguishing herded animals into humans and\nother animals. In the Sophist, kinds designated by negations,\nsuch as the not-large and the not-beautiful, have their own\ndistinctive feature (not-large, not-beautiful), and one might construe\nthem as forms, though the Stranger does not explicitly identify them\nas such (Sophist 257e\u2013258c). Evidence from the\nSophist thus encourages a division of animals herded into\nhumans and other animals, especially since the negative kind has a\npositive name: \u201cbeast.\u201d\n\n\nYoung Socrates has in fact made an error, but the nature of his error\nbecomes evident only later in the dialogue. In his zeal to reach the\ndestination he makes two related mistakes, one about the\nobjects of human herding, and the other about the associated\nart. The Stranger exploits the first mistake in the second\nstage of the division by relying on the boy\u2019s assumption that herding\nis a single undifferentiated activity with branches marked off by the\nphysical traits of the animals herded. But is statecraft concerned\nwith humans as biological specimens? Human biology studies our\nphysical traits, but the upcoming Myth in the Statesman\nreveals that the aspect of humans salient to statecraft is our way of\nlife, our culture and expertise (Statesman\n274b\u2013d).[3]\nYoung Socrates seems to view the objects of statecraft from the wrong\nperspective. Second, in focusing on the objects of\nstatecraft, he ignores the art itself and fails to notice that many\narts\u2014farming, medicine, physical training, as well as\nstatecraft\u2014look after the needs of human beings\n(Statesman 267e\u2013268a). As caretaker of humans, the\nstatesman has lots of competition. The manner of the\nstatesman\u2019s care, rooted in the structure of his expertise,\ndistinguishes statecraft from other arts that look after human beings\n(Statesman 274e\u2013275a; cf. Lane 1998, 44).\n\n\nWhat should we make of the Stranger\u2019s lecture on parts and kinds,\ngiven that it overlooks the real faults in Young Socrates\u2019 proposal\nand that the second stage of the division yields such odd results? The\nStranger probably suspects the nature of the boy\u2019s confusion and\nadopts an approach to help him see his mistake. His lecture assumes\nthe boy\u2019s point of view (that statecraft differs from other modes of\nherding because of the physical traits of the animals herded), advises\nhim to divide kinds into sub-kinds with roughly equal extension, and\nthen demonstrates in hilarious detail the results of that\nassumption. According to this interpretation, we should not take the\nStranger\u2019s lecture to reveal Plato\u2019s views on metaphysics and\nmethod. In the lecture itself the visitor appears to warn Young\nSocrates and the audience to beware of his advice (Statesman\n263b: \u201cBut be absolutely on your guard against ever thinking\nthat you have heard this [i.e., the difference between kind and part]\nclearly distinguished by me\u201d).\n\n\nOur suspicions should increase when we reflect on the Stranger\u2019s\npractice in the dichotomous divisions in the Sophist and\nearlier in the Statesman. At the beginning of the\nStatesman the visitor declares that his search for the\nstatesman will start from the same genus used in the search for the\nsophist, but he will cut it in a different place (Statesman\n258b\u2013c). No one remarks on the fact that in the Sophist\nthe visitor divided the genus art or expertise\n(techn\u00ea), whereas now he calls the genus\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (epist\u00eam\u00ea); he blurs the\ndifference further by using the terms techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea interchangeably in the\nStatesman. In the Sophist he cut the genus at step\none into productive and acquisitive (later he added separative), and\nthis time cuts it at step one into practical and theoretical. Recall\nthat in the Phaedrus the elder Socrates advises his\ninterlocutor to divide kinds at the natural joints: dividing at the\nnatural joints mattered in that dialogue, because Socrates was\nclassifying kinds in order to sort out an ambiguity between two senses\nof the word \u201clove\u201d (eros), a vulgar love on the\nleft and a heavenly love on the right (Phaedrus\n265e\u2013266b). The Sophist and Statesman use\ndichotomous division for a different purpose and consequently ignore\nparts on the left once marked off: the Stranger aims to define a\nsingle kind at the bottom of the right-hand branch of a\ntree. The target (however vague or even misguided the initial\nconception of it) determines what genus to divide at the start, then a\nuseful first cut and relevant next steps. Different targets (the\nangler, the sophist, the noble sophist, the statesman) prompt the\ninvestigators to carve up kinds in different ways (cf. Ackrill 1970,\n384; Cavini 1995, 131; Lane 1998, 34\u201338), and what counts as an\nappropriate cut depends on the target of the investigation. We should\nnot expect genuine kinds at intermediate steps on either the left- or\nright-hand side of the division.\n\n\nThe Stranger\u2019s lecture on parts and kinds and the second stage of the\ndichotomous division contribute to the overall impression that the\nStatesman is a philosophical exercise designed to train\nstudents to recognize, diagnose, and correct mistakes. The dialogue is\nfull of trial and error, with many mistakes noticed and corrected\nalong the way, while others go unremarked. This strategy provokes the\ninterlocutor and audience to see for themselves what has gone wrong\nand why. In this way they learn the methods of Platonic dialectic.\n",
