He received his MA in\nPhilosophy from the University of New Zealand (Wellington) in 1957 and\nthe following year completed a first-class Honours degree in\nmathematics there. His MA thesis, a 385-page work entitled Moral\nScepticism was given a mark of 95% by Arthur Prior, though he\nlater commented that this was \u201cnot so much a mark as an\nexclamation mark\u201d (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert\n(ed.) 2018, xiv). Blackwell agreed to publish a condensed version\nof the thesis but the required revisions were never undertaken.\n\n\nIn 1959, his teacher George Hughes then employed Sylvan to build a\nsmall electro-mechanical computer capable of determining whether input\nformulae were logical truths, logical falsehoods, or\nneither\u2014with green, red and amber lights displaying the\nrespective outcomes. He worked out how to build it from scratch using\nrelays and uniselectors discarded by the post office and it was a\nsuccess, but when run some years later it drew so much power that it\nblacked out the building it was housed in, ruining several experiments\nin biology running in the building at the time. The Biology Department\ninsisted that it never be used again (Hyde 2014, 43).\n\n\nIn mid-1959, while bushwalking in Australia, he met Jack Smart (then\nin Adelaide, later a colleague at the Australian National University\nand good bushwalking friend thereafter) who encouraged him to go to\nPrinceton for graduate work, as opposed to the then more usual choice\nof UK universities like Cambridge. At Smart\u2019s urging, \u201cas\na brash young man\u201d Sylvan travelled to Princeton with a\nFulbright scholarship for doctoral studies under Alonzo Church to\n\u201crepair and renovate a derelict philosophy of science\u201d\n(Sylvan 2000a, 7). After two and a half years he was awarded an MA\nfrom Princeton University but left before completing his PhD,\ndissatisfied with the intellectual climate there and subsequent lack\nof progress on his project. (He later received a PhD from Princeton in\n1980 for chapter one of Routley 1980.) He accepted a lectureship at\nSydney University in 1962 where he began lecturing undergraduates in\nlogic\u2014introducing modern Russellian theory, displacing John\nAnderson\u2019s long insistence on Aristotelian theory. There he met\nVal Plumwood (then Val Macrae, later Val Routley) and, in 1964, they\nmoved to the University of New England where Sylvan joined Len Goddard\nand a growing department\u2014the first to have begun teaching modern\nlogic in Australia under Goddard in 1957. Goddard and Sylvan founded\nthe first Australian Masters program in logic and formed\nthe Australasian Association of Logic, and with Len Goddard,\nDavid Londey, Ross Brady, Malcolm Rennie and Val Plumwood, he\ndeveloped what became known as the New England Group\u2014working on\nnon-classical logic and paradoxes, among other things\u2014but\nGoddard left a few years later, returning to St Andrews in\nScotland. In 1967, with a year\u2019s sabbatical owing, Sylvan and\nPlumwood married (with Plumwood taking the name Routley) and they\ndrove from the University to St Andrews to continue work with Goddard\n(traversing northern Australia, shipping the car from Darwin to\nSingapore, then overland into India and Pakistan, through the Middle\nEast and Eastern Europe). Upon return, in 1968, Sylvan took a\nposition at Monash University before being appointed to a Senior\nFellowship in Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences at\nthe Australian National University (ANU) in 1971, where he remained\nfor the rest of his career. With only postgraduate students to\nsupervise, his days teaching undergraduates was at an end. A number of\nresearchers from the New England Group subsequently joined him there\nand, with the addition of Bob Meyer, Graham Priest, and others, a\ngroup re-formed around Sylvan at the ANU\u2014the well-known Canberra\nLogic Group that went on to pioneering research in non-classical,\nespecially relevant, logic. Through his contribution to the formation\nof research groups that were both innovative and productive, Sylvan\ninfluenced a whole generation of Australian philosophers and\nlogicians. (For more on this history of modern logic in Australia,\ncf. Routley 1984c, Goddard 1992, and Brady and Mortensen 2014.)\n\n\nThe natural world also fascinated Sylvan. By the time of his death\nhe had purchased, and worked to conserve, five large tracts of rich\nforest areas\u2014four of which were subsequently bequeathed\nfor conservation.\n He took such a delight in nature, not so much the\ndelight that a romantic might take in the overall beauty of it all,\nbut a delight in its richness and complexity, in the detail that he\nfound in the structure of mosses and in the behaviour of\ninsects. \u2026 It\u2019s as if in a strange way he was part of it\n\u2026.  (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert (ed.)\n2018, xxv).\n\n\nWithin a year of arriving at the ANU (the centre of Australian\nforestry policy development), he and Plumwood became aware of plans\nfor extensive clearing of \u201cuseless\u201d native forest for pine\nplantations across the country and so began work on a sustained\ncritique of Australian forestry practices (Routley and Routley 1973a)\nalongside joint work rethinking issues in environmental\nphilosophy. The critical and \u201cpugilistic\u201d style of the\nbook caused an uproar in forestry\u2014with an attempt to suppress\nits publication (cf. Routley and Plumwood 1986). The repressive nature\nof the Australian forestry industry was widely understood from within,\nwith one forestry insider commenting, on receipt of a letter from\nSylvan early in the project, that: \u201cfor an Australian forester,\nreceiving a letter from you is somewhat akin to a new Party member\ngetting a birthday card from Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u201d (Sylvan\nRSC, Box #45). Closer to home, they were also criticised by some\ncolleagues who, in the days before applied philosophy had come of age,\nsaw their work as \u201cpropaganda\u201d rather than scholarly\nresearch. Despite resistance though, the book\u2019s successful\npublication helped reform forestry in Australia, being subsequently\ndescribed by a leading forestry expert as \u201cmonumentally\nimportant\u201d and \u201cthe most incisive and devastating economic\nanalysis of forestry \u2026 ever done in Australia\u201d (Byron\n1999, 53). All three editions published through the ANU Press between\n1973 and 1975 sold out but by 1975 Sylvan was, remarkably, banned from\nusing the ANU\u2019s Forestry Department Library (the central store\nfor documents relating to the development of national forestry policy)\nand further, planned editions were effectively stopped.\n\n\nIn 1975, Sylvan and Plumwood realised their dream of moving \u201coff\ngrid\u201d into the temperate rainforest in the coastal ranges east\nof Canberra where they began building a house from local stone (one of\nfive houses that Sylvan built over his life). Working first from a\ntent, then a shed, over the subsequent five years it took to build the\nhouse they produced much of their key work on relevant logic,\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and environmental philosophy\u2014often\ndiscussing philosophy while building with graduate students and guests\nwho could be roped in to help. After a productive twenty-year\npartnership, Sylvan and Plumwood parted ways in 1983, and he married\nLouise Sylvan (n\u00e9e Merlin). That was also the year he changed\nhis name from \u2018Richard Routley\u2019 to \u2018Richard\nSylvan\u2019 while Val Routley, as she was then known, became Val\nPlumwood. Sylvan and Plumwood continued to work and correspond on\nclosely related themes in environmental philosophy until\nSylvan\u2019s death in 1996.\n\n\nWhile his students and research assistants found him supportive and\nkind, Sylvan\u2019s style sometimes offended his peers. He could be\nvery blunt in his assessment of other\u2019s arguments and his shy\ndemeanour and lack of small talk did little to counteract feelings of\nrude-dismissal\u2014friend and colleague Bob Meyer commenting that he\n\u201cwas a difficult man; not only did he fail to suffer fools\ngladly, but he often disdained suffering them at all\u201d (Meyer\n1996). Sylvan himself also commented, for example, that his\n\u201cCritique of Deep Ecology\u201d (Sylvan 1985) would \u201crisk\noffending many friends in the deeper ecology movement\u201d (i) and,\nwhile he remained good friends with chief target Arne Naess, some\nwere, no doubt, offended. It earned him the title \u2018the bad boy\nof deep ecology\u2019 (Orton 2005, Other Internet\nResources)\u2014still considered a \u201cdeep ecologist\u201d\ndespite the substance of his criticism concluding in his rejecting\ndeep ecology in favour of what he termed \u201cdeep green\ntheory\u201d. Some who took offense on reading his response to their\nwork would later go on to befriend and work with Sylvan, having gotten\npast his blunt exterior. But with opposing-authority there was rarely\nany rapprochement; his anti-authoritarianism was deep-rooted and his\nanarchist tendencies manifest\u2014in both academic work and in his\nbehaviour.\n\n\nHis publishing habits also drew attention. Seeking an outlet for\nlonger papers and essays in the late 1970s, and wary of\n\u201cprofiteering\u201d publishers, in the do-it-yourself spirit\nthat infused much of Sylvan\u2019s life he began publishing a number\nof pre-print series in the Research School of Social Sciences where he\nworked at the ANU. Beginning with work of the Canberra Logic Group,\nthe \u201cYellow Series\u201d (as it became known) included over\ntwenty publications by Group members between 1978 and 1985. There\nfollowed other Series including work in logic, metaphysics, the\nphilosophy of science and much of his own work in environmental\nphilosophy. In total, there were over fifty such publications of which\nover half were Sylvan\u2019s own work. The publications ranged from\ntens of pages to hundreds and could be purchased by post from the\ndepartment for a few dollars. The largest, at just over one thousand\npages (Exploring Meinong\u2019s Jungle and Beyond), for\nexample, was available in hardback for $10. Such anomalous publishing\nhabits meant that a considerable amount of his work is now very hard\nto access (though, in some cases, republication through more usual\nchannels is underway\u2014e.g., Eckert (ed.) 2018; Hyde (ed.) 2019;\nand Weber (ed.) 2019).\n\n\nHe died in June 1996 aged 60, while entering a sacred temple in Bali\nto discuss Hindu philosophy with priests there.
