Organ Retrieval from Living Donors\n\nThe successful early transplants used organs taken from living donors.\nFor a long time the hope was that, when technical problems were\novercome, enough organs would be supplied by dead donors (Price 2009).\nThat way, healthy living people need not undergo the risk and\ndiscomfort of non-therapeutic organ retrieval. That hope however was\nfalse and the persistent shortage of donors has led to the increasing\nuse of living donors. It has been reported that 37,360 live donor\nkidney transplants occurred in 2019\n (Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation),\n over 37% of the global total. For livers, the global total from\nliving donors was 7,610, over 21% of the total. Rules governing living\ndonation have generally become more permissive, allowing donations\nfrom close genetic relatives, then spouses, then partners and friends,\nand, in some jurisdictions, even strangers.\n\nThe primary ethical question raised by living donation is to do with\nthe risk of having an organ taken. Having an organ taken imposes risks\nof death, disease, and discomfort from trauma, infection, the use of a\ngeneral anaesthetic, and the loss of all or part of an organ (although\nthe liver will usually regenerate, replacing the part removed). These\nrisks are not negligible. However, the risk of death is not enormous.\nFocusing on the kidney, the most frequently donated organ and the\nsafest to take from live donors, it has been estimated that the risk\nof death from kidney retrieval is 1/3000. There appears to be no\ndifference between healthy screened living kidney donors and the\ngeneral population in long-term survival and the risk of kidney\nfailure. (Ibrahim et al. 2009). That said, the general population is\nless healthy on average than the healthy screened living donors, who\ndo in fact undergo some extra risk of long-term renal failure as a\nresult of one kidney being removed (Grams et al. 2016).\n\nUnder what conditions, if any, is it permissible to impose such a risk\non someone who will receive no therapeutic benefit? For competent\npeople, it is overwhelmingly accepted that their valid consent is a\nnecessary condition of morally permissible retrieval. (A very few\nwriters disagree, e.g., Rakowski 1991 and, less clearly, Fabre 2006).\nBut even if consent is necessary, it may not be sufficient, and a\nfurther question is how much risk it is permissible to impose even on\nthose who consent. Living donor transplantation also raises important\nquestions about the validity of consent and about whether organs may\never be taken from healthy non-competent people, such as children.\n",
