    "main_text": "The Critique of Logical Positivism || The Verifiability Criterion of Cognitive Significance\n2.3 The Verifiability Criterion of Cognitive Significance\n\nHempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability\ncriterion could not be sustained. Since it restricts empirical\nknowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences,\nscientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from\nobservables. In a series of studies about cognitive significance and\nempirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability\ncriterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but\nthat universal generalizations are not, even though they include\ngeneral laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery.\nHypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are\nmeaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are\nnot. The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too\nstrong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not\njustifiable.\n\nIndeed, on the assumption that a sentence \\(S\\) is\nmeaningful if and only if its negation is meaningful, Hempel\ndemonstrated that the criterion produced consequences that were\ncounterintuitive if not logically inconsistent. The sentence,\n\u201cAt least one stork is red-legged\u201d, for example, is\nmeaningful because it can be verified by observing one red-legged\nstork; yet its negation, \u201cIt is not the case that even one stork\nis red-legged\u201d, cannot be shown to be true by observing any\nfinite number of red-legged storks and is therefore not meaningful.\nAssertions about God or The Absolute were meaningless by this\ncriterion, since they are not observation statements or deducible from\nthem. They concern entities that are non-observable. That was a\ndesirable result. But by the same standard, claims that were made by\nscientific laws and theories were also meaningless.\n\nIndeed, scientific theories affirming the existence of gravitational\nattractions and of electromagnetic fields were thus rendered\ncomparable to beliefs about transcendent entities such as an\nomnipotent, omniscient, and omni-benevolent God, for example, because\nno finite sets of observation sentences are sufficient to deduce the\nexistence of entities of those kinds. These considerations suggested\nthat the logical relationship between scientific theories and\nempirical evidence cannot be exhausted by means of observation\nsentences and their deductive consequences alone, but needs\nto include observation sentences and their inductive\nconsequences as well (Hempel 1958). More attention would now be\ndevoted to the notions of testability and of confirmation and\ndisconfirmation as forms of partial verification and partial\nfalsification, where Hempel would recommend an alternative to the\nstandard conception of scientific theories to overcome otherwise\nintractable problems with the observational/theoretical\ndistinction.\n",
