    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical perplexity about intention begins with its appearance in\nthree guises: intention for the future, as I intend to complete this\nentry by the end of the month; the intention with which someone acts,\nas I am typing with the further intention of writing an introductory\nsentence; and intentional action, as in the fact that I am typing\nthese words intentionally. As Elizabeth Anscombe wrote in a similar\ncontext, \u2018it is implausible to say that the word is equivocal as\nit occurs in these different cases\u2019 and from the fact that\n\u2018we are tempted to speak of \u201cdifferent senses\u201d of a\nword which is clearly not equivocal, we may infer that we are pretty\nmuch in the dark about the character of the concept which it\nrepresents\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, p. 1).\n\nThe principal task of the philosophy of intention is to uncover and\ndescribe the unity of these three forms. This project matters for\nquestions in the philosophy of mind, but also for ethics, where it is\ninvolved in the doctrine of double effect, for epistemology, and most\nobviously, for the nature of practical reason.\n\nWe can classify theories of intention roughly but usefully on two\naxes. First, how do they find unity in the guises of intention? Do\nthey explain one in terms of another? Which, if any, do they treat as\nprimary? There is a deep opposition here between accounts that take\nintention to be a mental state in terms of which we can explain\nintentional action, and those that do not. Second, how do they\nunderstand the relation between intention and evaluative thought,\nwhich bears on the possibility of akrasia, and the relation\nbetween intention and belief, which bears on the nature and scope of\nself-knowledge? These questions arise whatever the relation between\nintending and doing. Sections 1 and 2 address the first axis of\ndisagreement, while sections 3 to 5 primarily address the second.\n",
