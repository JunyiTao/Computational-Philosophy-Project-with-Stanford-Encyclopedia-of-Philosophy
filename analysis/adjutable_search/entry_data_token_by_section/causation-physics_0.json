    "main_text": "Different Philosophical Projects || Metaphysical, Descriptive, and Functional Projects\n1.1 Metaphysical, Descriptive, and Functional Projects\n\nIn discussing the role of causation in physics or in our conception of\nthe world more generally we may be engaged in several different\nphilosophical projects (Woodward 2014): a metaphysical\nproject, a descriptive project, and what Woodward calls\na \u201cfunctional project\u201d. While there are obvious\npoints of contact among these projects and a philosophical account may\ncontribute to more than one project simultaneously, the three projects\nhave distinctly different core aims and are characterized by different\nmethodologies.\n\nThe aim of the metaphysical project is to uncover the\nmetaphysical grounds or truth-makers for causal claims. The main\ndivision in the metaphysics of causation is between broadly Humean and\nnon-Humean accounts of causation. Humean accounts deny the existence\nof fundamental modalities and maintain that fundamentally the universe\nis composed of a distribution of categorical properties and relations\ninstantiated by localized entities\u2014what David Lewis called the\n\u201cHumean mosaic\u201d (Lewis 1973; Loewer 2012). On the Humean\nview, all true modal claims, including causal claims, are grounded in\nnon-modal features of the mosaic. Even though Humeans deny that modal\nproperties, including causal properties, are part of the world\u2019s\nfundamental ontology, they may allow for the existence of\nnon-fundamental causal facts that are reducible to fundamental\nphysical properties. Thus, Humeans can be\u2014and many of them\nare\u2014non-fundamentalists rather than\neliminativists about\n causation.[1]\n\nNon-Humeans, by contrast, take fundamental properties to include modal\nproperties, such as nomic necessitation relations, dispositional\nessences, or causal properties. For non-Humeans causal features can be\namong the fundamental building blocks of the world. Some non-Humeans\nhold that the dynamical laws of physics are fundamentally causal laws\nin virtue of which earlier states of a system or of the world produce\nlater states (Maudlin 2007). Others maintain that objects possess\nfundamental dispositions, capacities, or essences that are causal in\nnature (Cartwright 1989; Bird 2007).\n\nIn contrast with the metaphysical project, the descriptive\nproject aims to describe our causal reasoning practices.\nTraditionally philosophers have tended to conceive of this project as\nhaving as its core aim to provide conceptual analyses of our everyday\nconcept or concepts of cause. A conceptual analysis offers necessary and\nsufficient conditions for claims of the form \u201cc causes\ne\u201d. Regularity accounts, Mackie\u2019s INUS\ncondition account, or David Lewis\u2019s counterfactual analysis are\nall examples of the descriptive project. In principle, the project\ncould appeal to a broad range of data, including empirical work by\npsychologists and cognitive scientists. Generally, however, the\ndescriptive project has focused almost exclusively on probing what\nphilosophers upon reflection take to be commonsense intuitions\nconcerning causal judgements (often involving Billy and Suzy throwing\nrocks or assassins pouring poison in drinks). Those developing\nconceptual analyses tend to focus their analyses on commonsense causal\nclaims rather than on the use of causal notions in physics or in the\nsciences more generally.\n\nA third project, the functional project, which Woodward\noutlines and defends in (Woodward 2014), asks what kind of functional\nrole causal concepts play in our cognitive architecture and what\npurposes and goals causal cognition can serve. An influential argument\nfor the indispensability of causal concepts is Nancy\nCartwright\u2019s argument that causal notions play a crucial role in\ndistinguishing effective from ineffective strategies (Cartwright\n1979).\n\nThe functional project has close affinities to what in recent years\nhas been discussed under the term conceptual engineering\n(Cappelen 2018). Conceptual engineering aims to develop precise\nphilosophical concepts that fulfil certain cognitive goals, often\ntaking an existing concept as its starting point, offering a\nphilosophical precissification of this concept and then engaging in an\nassessment of the precissified concept\u2019s usefulness. In taking\nexisting concepts of causation as its starting point the functional\nproject concerning causation engages primarily in what David Chalmers\ncalls \u201cre-engineering\u201d rather than \u201cde novo\nengineering\u201d (Chalmers 2018, see\n Other Internet Resources).\n Unlike the descriptive project, the functional project possesses a\nmethodological or normative dimension, evaluating the usefulness of\ncausal concepts and of types of causal reasoning.\n",
