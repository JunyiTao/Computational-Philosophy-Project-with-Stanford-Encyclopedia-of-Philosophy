    "main_text": "Later Developments || Affirmative Propositions with Empty Terms\n5.2 Affirmative Propositions with Empty Terms\n\n\nThe fact that universal affirmatives with empty subject terms are\nfalse runs into a problem with Aristotelian scientific theory.\nAristotle held that \u2018Every human is an animal\u2019 is a\nnecessary truth.  If so, it is true at every time.  So at every time\nits subject is non-empty.  And so there are humans at every time.  But\nthe dominant theology held that before the last day of creation there\nwere no humans.  So there is a contradiction.\n\nOckham avoids this problem by abandoning parts of Aristotle\u2019s theory:\nAlthough it conflicts with the texts of Aristotle, yet\naccording to the truth no proposition among those which concern\nprecisely corruptible things [which is] entirely affirmative and\nentirely about the present is able to be a principle or a conclusion\nof a demonstration because any such is contingent. For if some such\nwere necessary this would seem to be so especially for this one\n\u201cA human is a rational animal\u201d. But this is contingent\nbecause it follows \u201cA human is a rational animal, therefore a\nhuman is an animal\u201d and further \u201ctherefore a human is\ncomposed of a body and a sensitive soul\u201d. But this is contingent\nbecause if there was no human that would be false because of the false\n[thing] implied because it would imply that something is composed from\na body and soul which would then be false. [Ockham SL\nIII.2.5]\n\nThe contradiction might also vanish if propositions in scientific\ntheory have unusual meanings.  One option is that universal\naffirmatives are understood in scientific theory as universalized\nconditionals, as they are understood today.  This would not interfere\nwith the fact that they are not conditionals in uses outside of\nscientific theory.  Although De Rijk (1973, 52) states that Ockham\nholds such a view, he seems to explicitly reject it, stating that\n\u2018A human is a rational animal\u2019 is not equivalent to\n\u2018If a human is then a human is a rational animal \u201cbecause\nthis is a conditional and not a categorical\u201d. [Ockham SL\nII.11]\n\nBuridan\u2019s view is neater.  He holds that when engaged in\nscientific theory, the subject matter is not limited to presently\nexisting things.  Instead, the propositions have their usual meanings,\nbut an expanded subject matter.  When the word \u2018human\u2019 is\nused, one is discussing every human, past and future, and even\npossible humans. [Buridan SdD 4.3.4] With such an understanding, the\nsubject of \u2018Every human is an animal\u2019 is not empty at\nall.\n\nWork on logic continued for the next couple of centuries, though\nmost of it was lost and had little influence. But the topic of empty\nterms was squarely faced, and solutions that were given within the\nMedieval tradition were consistent with [SQUARE]. I rely here on\nAshworth 1974, 201\u201302, who reports the most common themes in the\ncontext of post-medieval discussions of contraposition. One theme is\nthat contraposition is invalid when applied to universal or empty\nterms, for the sorts of reasons given by Buridan. The O form is\nexplicitly held to lack existential import. A second theme, which\nAshworth says was the most usual thing to say, is also found in\nBuridan: additional inferences, such as contraposition, become valid\nwhen supplemented by an additional premise asserting that the terms in\nquestion are non-empty.\n",
