    "main_text": "Theorizing Ethical Supervenience || The modal strength of ethical supervenience\n1.3 The modal strength of ethical supervenience\n\nSo far this entry has talked freely of necessity, possibility, and\npossible worlds. However, one can use such talk to discuss importantly\ndifferent modal standards: for example, philosophers talk of\nlogical necessity, conceptual necessity,\nmetaphysical necessity, nomic necessity, and\nnormative necessity. The aim of this section is to briefly\norient readers to each of these notions. To begin, consider some\nexamples:\n\nAll bachelors are bachelors\nAll bachelors are unmarried\nNothing can travel faster than light\nAtoms of gold contain 79 protons\nPain is bad\n\n\nOn one traditional gloss, a sentence is logically necessary\nif it would remain true given any uniform and grammatically legitimate\nreinterpretation of the non-logical expressions of that sentence.\nSentence (1) is a promising example: the only non-logical word in (1)\nis \u2018bachelor\u2019, and any uniform and grammatically\nappropriate interpretation of \u2018bachelor\u2019 in (1) will\nresult in a true sentence. (For more on logical truths, see the entry\non\n logical truth.\n Section 1.1 of that entry discusses the alleged modal force of\nlogical truths.)\n\nBy contrast, (2) is not a logical truth: one could easily hold fixed\nits logical structure, but vary the meaning of \u2018bachelor\u2019\nor \u2018unmarried\u2019 and thereby produce a false sentence.\nHowever, (2) is a promising candidate to be conceptually necessary. On\none gloss, a sentence is conceptually necessary (or\n\u201canalytically true\u201d) if it is true solely in virtue of the\nmeanings or concepts involved in the sentence. Sentence (2) is a\ntraditional example. If \u2018bachelor\u2019 means unmarried\nmale, then the meaning of the sentence suffices to explain why it\nis true. (The notion of analyticity is famously controversial; for\ndiscussion, see the entry on the\n analytic-synthetic distinction.)\n\nTwo notes are relevant here. First, some philosophers will talk of\n\u2018logical\u2019 necessity or supervenience as a way of\ndiscussing what this entry is calling conceptual necessity or\nsupervenience. Here, as elsewhere, it is important to keep track of\nwhat exactly an author intends to express by their terms. Second, some\nproponents of analytic truth will nonetheless reject the idea of a\ndistinct conceptual modality (e.g. Jackson 1998, Ch. 3). Such\nphilosophers can, however, capture importantly related phenomena by\ndiscussing modal claims formulated in terms of sentences and their\nintensions.\n\nNext consider (3): this does not seem to be true simply because of the\nconcepts it expresses. Rather, if it is true, it seems to reflect an\nimportant law of nature: a deep and non-accidental pattern in our\nuniverse. Some philosophers think that such laws underwrite a\ndistinctive sort of modality: a proposition is nomically\nnecessary just in case its falsity is incompatible with the laws\nof nature. On this view, (3) is nomically necessarily true, because it\nfollows from the laws governing the speed of light.\n\nNow consider (4). It is commonly thought that (4) is necessarily true.\nFor example: a substance composed overwhelmingly of atoms that do not\ncontain 79 protons in their nuclei could not be gold. But (4) does not\non its face look like a conceptual truth: it was a substantive\ndiscovery that there were protons at all, let alone how many protons\nan atom of gold characteristically possesses. Further (4) does not\nseem like it reflects a law of nature in the way that (3) does:\nrather, (4) seems to follow immediately from facts about what it is to\nbe gold. Examples like (4) thus purport to give us an initial grasp on\nmetaphysical modality as distinct from the other modalities considered\nthus far.\n\nStill more controversial is the notion of normative necessity\n(Fine2002, Rosen 2020). One way of understanding this idea appeals to\nan analogy with nomic modality. We can think of nomically necessary\nfacts as those which follow from facts about the laws of nature. For\nexample, the nomic impossibility of something traveling faster than\nlight is a direct consequence of it being a law of nature that that\nnothing can travel faster than light. Someone might similarly claim\nthat there are fundamental normative laws or principles.\nSuppose that (5) stated one of those laws. Then the normative\nimpossibility of a state\u2019s being good just because it is painful\ncould be understood as expressing a consequence of that underlying\nnormative law.\n\nThere is enormous controversy about each of these alleged varieties of\nmodality. For each of logical, conceptual, nomic, metaphysical and\nnormative flavors of modality, some philosophers have raised important\nchallenges to whether that flavor of modality is well-regimented,\ntheoretically useful, or genuinely distinct from others on the list.\nThis entry will not enter seriously into those debates. (For\ndiscussion of some of the issues, see the entry on\n varieties of modality.)\n If we instead provisionally assume that each of these notions is\nlegitimate, this will put us in a position to ask (in\n Section 2,\n below): what is the modal strength of the supervenience thesis that\nwe should accept?\n",
