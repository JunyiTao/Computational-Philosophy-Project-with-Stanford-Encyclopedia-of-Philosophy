    "main_text": "Human Perfection || The Station of No Station\n6.1 The Station of No Station\n\nEach of \u201cthe levels, stations, and stages\u201d represents an\nactualization of a potential deiformity, or an instance of becoming\ncharacterized by one or more divine names. Each divine attribute and\neach prophetic archetype sets up a \u201cstation\u201d\n(maq\u00e2m) in which human beings can stand and from which\nthey can observe the nature of things. There are countless stations of\nknowledge and spiritual perfection, and each bestows specific\ncharacter traits and points of view. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee often\ntells us that such-and-such a chapter of the Openings\npertains to the standpoint of Moses, or Jesus, or Abraham. In the same\nway, he divides Ringstones into twenty-seven chapters, each\nof which is dedicated to a prophet or sage who is presented as a word\nor logos (kalima) embodying the wisdom (hikma) of a\nspecific divine name. His ultimate purpose in describing the various\nstandpoints is to highlight the Station of No Station (maq\u00e2m\nl\u00e2 maq\u00e2m), also called \u201cthe Muhammadan\nStation\u201d. This is full realization of the Reality of Realities;\nit embraces all stations and standpoints without being determined and\ndefined by any of them. \u201cThe people of perfection have realized\nall stations and states and passed beyond these to the station above\nboth majesty and beauty, so they have no attribute and no\ndescription\u201d (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 2:133.19).\n\nPerfect Man, standing in the Station of No Station, is in effect the\nhuman analogue of Nondelimited Being, which assumes every delimitation\nwithout itself becoming limited. Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee sometimes calls\nthis station \u201cthe point at the center of the circle of\nexistence\u201d because it has no dimensions in itself, but all of\nmanifest reality is arranged in reference to it. He also explains it\nin terms of the contrast between Being and quiddity (i.e., fixed\nentity). Everyone other than Perfect Man has a specific whatness,\ndistinguishing him from everyone else, which is to say that each\nperson stands in a defined \u201clevel, station, and stage\u201d.\nPerfect Man, however, manifests the Real per se, so his whatness is\nidentical with Being, not with this or that. Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee\nwrites:\n\nNo one tastes this and reaches its source except him whose essence has\ncome to be nondelimited. Then the bonds\u2014the contingent\nproperties, states, attributes, stations, configurations, acts, and\nbeliefs\u2014are loosened, and he is not confined by any of them. By\nhis essence he flows in everything, just as existence flows in the\nrealities of all things without end or beginning\u2026. When the\nReal gave me to witness this tremendous place of witnessing, I saw\nthat its possessor has no fixed entity and no reality.\n(Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee, al-Nafah\u00e2t, 265\u201366; cited in\nChittick 2004)\n\n",
