    "main_text": "Critical Reflections\n7. Critical Reflections\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s intermittently-encountered claim that Will is the\nthing-in-itself only to us, provides philosophical space for\nhim to assert consistently that mystical experience provides a\npositive insight. It also relativizes to the human condition,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s position that the world is Will. This entails\nthat his outlook on daily life as a cruel and violence-filled world\n\u2013 a world generated by the application of the principle of\nsufficient reason, is based on a human-conditioned intuition, namely,\nthe direct, double-knowledge of one\u2019s body as both subject and\nobject. So along these lines, Schopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic vision\nof the world can itself be seen to be grounded upon the subject-object\ndistinction, i.e., the general root of the principle of sufficient\nreason. As mentioned above, we can see this fundamental reliance upon\nthe subject-object distinction reflected in the very title of his\nbook, The World as Will and Representation, that can be read\nas, in effect, The World as Subjectively and Objectively\nApprehended.\n\nThis observation does not render (within the parameters of his\noutlook) Schopenhauer\u2019s ruthlessly competitive world-scenario\ntypically any less avoidable, but it does lead one to understand\nSchopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic vision of the world-as-Will, as less\nof an outlook derived from an absolute standpoint that transcends\nhuman nature \u2013 although he frequently speaks in this\nabsolutistic way \u2013 and as more of an outlook expressive of human\nnature in its effort to achieve philosophical understanding. Owing to\nits fundamental reliance upon the subject-object distinction,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s classical account of the daily world as the\nobjectification of Will, is understandable not only as a traditional\nmetaphysical theory that purports to describe the unconditional truth.\nIt can be understood alternatively as an expression of the human\nperspective on the world, that, as an embodied individual, we\ntypically cannot avoid. This tempered approach, though, does leave us\nwith the decisive question of why the world would appear to be so\nviolent, if the universe\u2019s core is not thoroughly\n\u201cWill,\u201d but is also something mysterious beyond this. For\nif Will is only one of an untold number of the universe\u2019s\ndimensions, there would be no reason to expect that the individuating\neffects of the principle of sufficient reason would generate a world\nthat feasts on itself in the manner that Schopenhauer describes.\n",
