    "main_text": "Developmental and Evolutionary Implications || Assimilation\n4.4 Assimilation\n\nOne of the most interesting ways in which multiple inheritance systems\ncan interact evolutionarily is through processes such as the\nBaldwin Effect and genetic assimilation. These\nnotions purport to explain how selection can drive developmental\nresponses to environmental demands to become less dependent on the\npresence of the external stimuli, and become increasingly hereditary\n(see Ancel 1999, 2000; Crispo 2007; Scheiner 2014, Weber & Depew\n2003). In these processes, non-genetic variants affect the selection\nof genetic variations in favor of those that produce congruent\nphenotypic results (Jablonka & Lamb 2005/2014: chap. 7). In the\nsimplest case, originally discussed by Baldwin, a developmental\nresponse to the environment allows organisms to survive and reproduce\nfor enough generations for genetic mutations to accumulate through\nnatural selection and make the developmental accommodation to the\nexternal stimulus unnecessary. The genetic mutations that are favored\nare those that act in tandem with the developmental response. Conrad\nWaddington characterized a process he termed genetic\nassimilation leading to similar results, but emphasized the role\nplayed by changes in combinations of genes and reorganization of\ngenetic networks following the reshuffling of genes during the sexual\nprocess. The developmentally produced variants that lead the\nassimilation process need not be hereditary, and may be the result of\nrecurrent plastic developmental responses in each generation. When\nthey are hereditary, however, their inheritance can reinforce their\nspread in the population.\n\nA similar phenomenon can result from processes of niche construction,\nwhich affect the selective environment faced by organisms and their\ndescendants (Odling-Smee et al. 2003). A particularly well known\nexample of the possible effects of cultural niche construction on\ngenetic evolution is the relationship between a history of dairy\nfarming in a culture and the prevalence of adults with a genetic\nvariant enabling them to continuously produce lactase, the enzyme\nneeded to digest fresh milk (Durham 1991; Mace 2009). This example\nillustrates how cultural evolution can drive genetic evolution, a\nelement of gene-culture coevolution.\n\nPhenomena such as these may be characterized as being\n\u201cLamarckian\u201d in flavor, even though they operate according\nto traditional Darwinian theory, since they provide room for\ninstructive or induced processes in evolution. The epigenetic,\nbehavioral, and symbolic dimensions in evolution discussed by Jablonka\nand Lamb produce induced variation which may affect evolution through\nprocesses of assimilation as well as through their hereditary affects.\nIn this way various inheritance systems other than the genetic can\nindirectly affect the evolution of genetic traits.\n\nAssimilation may typically result in the response being partially\nrather than entirely independent of external stimuli. In other words,\nthe response may become less dependent on external stimuli, and more\nbiased in favor of particular results, without becoming automatic.\nJablonka and Lamb call this phenomenon partial assimilation\n(Jablonka & Lamb 2005: 290), and see it as particularly important\nfor understanding the way behavior (BISs) and language (the SIS)\naffect the evolution of mind. A further mechanism, identified by\nAvital and Jablonka, is assimilate and stretch. Here, given a\nlimited and fixed capacity for learning, new learned elements may be\nrecruited, when part of a behavioral sequence that formerly depended\non learning becomes genetically assimilated (Avital & Jablonka\n2000).\n\nAlexander Badyaev suggests an evolutionary continuum of inheritance\nsystems that reflect the extent or stage of assimilation from\nepigenetic (in the broad sense of Jablonka and Lamb) to genetic\ninheritance. Parental effects may be a transient stage along this\ncontinuum, whose assimilation depends on the dynamics of the\nenvironment, and other constraints (Badyaev 2009; Badyaev & Uller\n2009; Helanter\u00e4 & Uller 2010; see also: Yona et al.\n2015).\n\nThe overall picture that emerges from the consideration of\nassimilation is of evolution driven by developmental capacities and\nbiases that affect which genetic mutations are selected. Mary-Jane\nWest-Eberhard summarized this observation with the claim that genes\nare typically followers in evolution rather than the ones leading the\nway (Jablonka 2006; West-Eberhard 2003).\n",
