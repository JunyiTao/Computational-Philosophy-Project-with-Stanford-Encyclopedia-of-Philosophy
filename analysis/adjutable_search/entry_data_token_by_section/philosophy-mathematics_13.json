    "main_text": "Structuralism and Nominalism || What Numbers Could Not Be\n4.1 What Numbers Could Not Be\n\nAs if saddling platonism with one difficult problem were not enough\n (section 3.4),\n Benacerraf formulated a challenge for set-theoretic platonism\n(Benacerraf 1965). The challenge takes the following form.\n\nThere exist infinitely many ways of identifying the natural numbers\nwith pure sets. Let us restrict, without essential loss of generality,\nour discussion to two such ways: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{I}{:} & \\\\ 0 &= \\varnothing \\\\ 1 &= \\{\\varnothing\\} \\\\ 2 &= \\{\\{\\varnothing\\}\\} \\\\ 3 &= \\{\\{\\{\\varnothing\\}\\}\\} \\\\ \\vdots&\\\\ &\\\\ \\mathrm{II}{:} & \\\\ 0 &= \\varnothing \\\\ 1 &= \\{\\varnothing \\} \\\\ 2 &= \\{\\varnothing , \\{ \\varnothing \\}\\}\\\\ 3 &= \\{\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\}, \\{\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\} \\\\ \\vdots& \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThe simple question that Benacerraf asks is:\n\nWhich of these consists solely of true identity statements: I or\nII?\n\nIt seems very difficult to answer this question. It is not hard to see\nhow a successor function and addition and multiplication operations\ncan be defined on the number-candidates of I and on the\nnumber-candidates of II so that all the arithmetical statements that\nwe take to be true come out true. Indeed, if this is done in the\nnatural way, then we arrive at isomorphic structures (in the\nset-theoretic sense of the word), and isomorphic structures make the\nsame sentences true (they are elementarily equivalent). It is\nonly when we ask extra-arithmetical questions, such as \u2018\\(1 \\in\n3\\)?\u2019 that the two accounts of the natural numbers yield\ndiverging answers. So it is impossible that both accounts are correct.\nAccording to story I, \\(3 = \\{\\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\}\\), whereas\naccording to story II, \\(3 = \\{\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\{\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\}\\). If both accounts were correct,\nthen the transitivity of identity would yield a purely set theoretic\nfalsehood.\n\nSumming up, we arrive at the following situation. On the one hand,\nthere appear to be no reasons why one account is superior to the\nother. On the other hand, the accounts cannot both be correct. This\npredicament is sometimes called labelled Benacerraf\u2019s\nidentification problem.\n\nThe proper conclusion to draw from this conundrum appears to be that\nneither account I nor account II is correct. Since similar\nconsiderations would emerge from comparing other reasonable-looking\nattempts to reduce natural numbers to sets, it appears that natural\nnumbers are not sets after all. It is clear, moreover, that a similar\nargument can be formulated for the rational numbers, the real\nnumbers\u2026 Benacerraf concludes that they, too, are not sets at\nall.\n\nIt is not at all clear whether G\u00f6del, for instance, is committed\nto reducing the natural numbers to pure sets. A platonist can uphold\nthe claim that the natural numbers can be embedded into the\nset-theoretic universe while maintaining that the embedding should not\nbe seen as an ontological reduction. Indeed, on Linsky and\nZalta\u2019s plenitudinous platonist account, the natural numbers\nhave no properties beyond those that are attributed to them by our\ntheory of the natural numbers (Peano Arithmetic). But then it seems\nthat platonists would have to take a similar line with respect to the\nrational numbers, the complex numbers, \u2026. Whereas maintaining\nthat the natural numbers are sui generis admittedly has some appeal,\nit is perhaps less natural to maintain that the complex numbers, for\ninstance, are also sui generis. And, anyway, even if the natural\nnumbers, the complex numbers, \u2026 are in some sense not reducible\nto anything else, one may wonder if there may not be another way to\nelucidate their nature.\n",
