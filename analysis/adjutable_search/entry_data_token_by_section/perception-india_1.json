    "main_text": "Perspectives on Perception\n2. Perspectives on Perception\n\nMost classical Indian philosophical schools accept perception as the\nprimary means of knowledge, but differ on the nature, kinds and\nobjects of perceptual knowledge. Here we first survey Buddhist and\northodox Hindu schools\u2019 definitions of perception (excluding\nVai\u015bes\u0323ika and Yoga schools since they simply take on board\nNy\u0101ya and S\u0101\u1e43khya ideas, respectively) and note the\nissues raised by these definitions. As mentioned above, the orthodox\nschools generally accept both non-conceptualized (indeterminate) and\nconceptualized (determinate) perceptual states in sharp contrast to\nthe Buddhist view that perception is always non-conceptualized or\nindeterminate awareness.\n",
