    "main_text": "Apprehension & Judgement\n4. Apprehension & Judgement\n\nSince Cook Wilson\u2019s philosophy was largely defined in opposition\nto British Idealism, it is worth beginning with some points of\nexplicit disagreement. Roughly put, under the idealist view knowledge\nis constituted by a coherent set of mutually supporting beliefs, none\nof which are basic, while others would be derivative. Surprisingly,\nwhen H. H. Joachim published The Nature of Truth (1906),\nperhaps the best statement of the coherence theory of truth usually\nattributed to the British Idealists, Cook Wilson criticized him for\nrelying on a discredited \u2018correspondence\u2019 theory (SI,\n809\u2013810). Cook Wilson did not argue directly against the\ncoherence theory, as Russell did (Russell 1910, 131\u2013146), but\nsimply took the opposite foundationalist stance. He reasoned that the\nchain of justification ought to come to an end and that this end point\nis some non-derivative knowledge, which he called\n\u2018apprehension\u2019 (SI, 816). As he put it: \u201cit becomes\nevident that there must be apprehensions not got by inference or\nreasoning\u201d (UL, \u00a7 18).\n\nAs Farquharson noted (SI, 78 n.), Cook Wilson did not define his key\nnotion of \u2018apprehension\u2019. (This is related with Cook\nWilson\u2019s claim discussed in section 5 that knowledge is\nundefinable.) The notion appears to be at the same time close to\nAristotle\u2019s \u2018noesis\u2019 and to Russell\u2019s\n\u2018acquaintance\u2019. Cook Wilson obviously took his lead from a\ntradition beginning with Posterior Analytics B 19 and his\ncomments are reminiscent of Thomas Reid, who argues in his Essays\non the Intellectual Powers of Man (Bk. II, chap. v) that\nperception involves some conception of the object and the conviction\nof its existence, this conviction being immediate, non-inferential and\nnot open to doubt. Cook Wilson was not exactly faithful to Aristotle\nand Reid, however, since he argued that apprehensions can be both\nperceptual and non-perceptual (SI, 79), and that some are obtained by\ninference while some are not, the latter being the material of\ninference (SI, 84\u201385). Furthermore, he argued that perceptual\napprehensions should not be confused with sensations, as the mere\nhaving of a sensation is not yet to know what the sensation is, an\nidea that has echoes in Austin (Austin 1979, 91\u201394 & 122\nn.2). For this, one needs an \u201coriginative act of\nconsciousness\u201d that goes beyond mere passivity and compares the\nsensation in order to apprehend its definite character. As Cook Wilson\nput it: \u201cwe are really comparing but we do not recognize that we\nare\u201d (SI, 46).\n\nCook Wilson thought it misleading to base logic on\n\u2018judgement\u2019 instead of \u2018proposition\u2019 or\n\u2018statement\u2019 (SI, 94) and he questioned the traditional\nanalysis of proposition under the form \u2018S is\nP\u2019, which he saw has having various meanings (Joseph\n(1916a, 6), see also section 9 for a related point). In his polemics\nagainst idealism, Cook Wilson\u2019s main target was the traditional\ntheory of judgement that one finds, e.g., in Bradley\u2019s\nPrinciples of Logic (Bradley 1928), where the topic is simply\ndivided into \u2018judgement\u2019 and \u2018inference\u2019.\nThere would thus be a common form of thinking called the\n\u2018judgement\u2019 that \u2018S is P\u2019,\nwhich would include non-inferred knowledge, opinion, and belief, but\nwould exclude inferred knowledge. One would be misled, he argued, by\nthe common verbal form \u2018S is P\u2019 that\nknowledge, belief, and opinion are species of the same genre called\n\u2018judgement\u2019 (SI, 86\u20137). He claimed instead to follow\n\u2018ordinary usage\u2019 in adopting a \u2018judicial\u2019\naccount of \u2018judgement\u2019:\n\nA judgement is a decision. To judge is to decide. It implies previous\nindecision; a previous thinking process, in which we were doubting.\nThose verbal statements, therefore, which result from a state of mind\nnot preceded by such doubt, statements which are not decisions, are\nnot judgements, though they may have the same verbal form as\njudgements. (SI, 92\u20133)\n\n\nHe further argued first that inferring is thus one of the forms of\njudgement: \u201cif we take judging in its most natural sense, that\nis as decision on evidence after deliberation, then inferring is just\none of those form of apprehending to which the words judging and\njudgement most properly apply\u201d (SI, 86). Some inferences are,\nhowever, immediately apprehended, e.g., when one recognizes that it\nfollows from \u2018if p, then q\u2019 and\n\u2018p\u2019, that \u2018q\u2019. Furthermore,\nthe presence of a prior indecision or doubt, as opposed to confidence,\nis deemed an essential ingredient of judgement. It does not, however,\nfully put an end to doubt: as a judge may well be mistaken, our\nordinary judgements \u201cform fallible opinions only\u201d (Joseph\n1916a, 160).\n\nNow, if indecision and doubt are involved prior to judgement,\napprehension or knowledge (perceptual or not) could not be judgement,\nbecause, by definition, there is no room for doubt in these cases.\nWhen one is of the opinion that p, one has found the evidence\nbeing in favour of p, without being conclusive. But Cook\nWilson thought statements of opinion as not involving the expression\nof a decision, so they not judgement either:\n\n\nIt is a peculiar thing\u2014the result of estimate\u2014and we call\nit by a peculiar name, opinion. For it, taken in its strict and proper\nsense, we can use no term that belongs to knowing. For the opinion\nthat A is B is founded on evidence we know to be insufficient, whereas\nit is of the very nature of knowledge not to make its statements at\nall on grounds recognized to be insufficient, nor to come to any\ndecision except that the grounds are insufficient; for it is here that\nin the knowing activity we stop. (SI, 99\u2013100)\n\n\nMoreover, there is no \u2018common mental attitude\u2019 involved in\n\u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018opining\u2019:\n\n\nOne need hardly add that there is no verbal form corresponding to any\nsuch fiction as a mental activity manifested in a common mental\nattitude to the object about which we know or about which we have an\nopinion. Moreover it is vain to seek such a common quality in belief,\non the ground that the man who knows that A is B and the\nman who has that opinion both believe\nthat A is B. (SI, 100)\n\n\nIt is an important characteristic of \u2018believing\u2019, setting\nit apart from other \u2018activities of consciousness\u2019, that it\nis accompanied with a feeling of confidence, greater than in\nopining:\n\nTo a high degree of such confidence, where it naturally exists, is\nattached the word belief, and language here, as not infrequently, is\ntrue to distinctions which have value in our consciousness. It is not\nopinion, it is not knowledge, it is not properly even judgement. (SI,\n102)\n\n\nThe upshot of these remarks is that \u2018knowledge\u2019,\n\u2018belief\u2019, and \u2018opinion\u2019 are not, as idealists\nwould have it, species of the same genre, \u2018judgement\u2019 or\n\u2018thinking\u2019: these are all distinct and sui\ngeneris. This leads to the all-important distinction between\n\u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018belief\u2019, discussed in the\nnext section: they do not merely differ in kind, they are not even two\nspecies of the same genus (Prichard 1950, 87). But Cook Wilson also\nheld the view that knowing is more foundational, so to speak, as it is\npresupposed by other \u2018activities of thinking\u2019 such as\njudging and opining. For example, opinion involves knowledge, but goes\nbeyond it:\n\n\nThere will be something else besides judgement to be recognized in the\nformation of opinion, that is to say knowledge, as manifested in such\nactivities as occur in ordinary perception; activities, in other\nwords, which are not properly speaking decisions.
