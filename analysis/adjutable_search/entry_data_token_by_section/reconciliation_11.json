Perhaps one of the greatest factors in determining whether\nreconciliation efforts will be successful is the manner in which they\nare selected. A number of measures (e.g., apologies, truth telling)\nare aimed at restoring a sense of dignity and inclusion to formerly\nmistreated or disempowered parties. This effect may be magnified if\nthose parties also have a say, for example, in choosing criminal\ntrials or truth commissions, determining the form reparations would\ntake, or designing memorials.\n\nRestorative justice approaches to criminal sentencing place a premium\non victims\u2019 participation (Johnstone 2002). In practices such as\nsentencing conferences and victim-offender mediation, the victim plays\nan active role in determining the manner in which the offender will\nmake up for her crime. In this way, the victim has a greater chance of\nreceiving a form of satisfaction that he will value more (e.g.,\nrestitution payments rather than the imprisonment of the offender).\nThe victim\u2019s active participation may also provide him with an\nopportunity to exorcise his resentments or fears, restore his sense of\ncontrol over his life, and reaffirm his status as a valued member of\nthe community who should not have been mistreated (Johnstone\n2002).\n\nRestorative justice models also value the active participation of\noffenders in finding a resolution to wrongdoing (Zehr 1990). For\nexample, offenders may be asked to propose forms of reparation they\ncould offer to victims. In being allowed an opportunity to play a role\nin building a better future, the offender may avoid a dangerous\nrage-shame spiral and regain a sense of self-worth (Braithwaite\n2000).\n\nIn political cases, the roles of victim and perpetrator are often not\nclear-cut or agreed upon. Here, incorporating input from the various\nparties to the conflict in designing reconciliation processes will\nincrease the chances that those measures will be viewed as legitimate\nacross the entire community (Barsalou and Baxter 2007). Inclusive\ndeliberative processes for the selection, design, and interpretation\nof reconciliation efforts can also provide a valuable model for the\nfuture of the community (Crocker 1999, Anker 2016). The future will\nnever be free of conflict, so an appropriate goal of reconciliation\nprocesses is to establish norms for resolving disagreements in a\npeaceful, just and equitable manner.\n",
