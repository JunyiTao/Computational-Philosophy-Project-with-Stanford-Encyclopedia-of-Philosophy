    "main_text": "Probability, Verisimilitude, and Plausibility\n7. Probability, Verisimilitude, and Plausibility\n\n\nGiven Peirce\u2019s tychism and his view that statistical information is\noften the best information we can have about phenomena, it should not\nbe surprising that Peirce devoted close attention to the analysis of\nsituations in which perfect exactness and perfect certitude were\nunattainable. It is only to be expected that he would devote a great\ndeal of attention, for example, to probability theory. Indeed, Peirce\ndid so from the dates of even his earliest thinking. Not only, for\nexample, did he extensively employ the concept of probability, but\nalso he offered a pragmaticistic account of the notion of probability\nitself. Yet it would be a huge mistake to think that Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophizing about situations of imperfection of exactness and\ncertitude were confined merely to the theory of probability.\n\n\nRather, from the outset of his thinking about the matters, in about\n1863, his attention was directed to the broadest sorts of issues\nconnected with statistical inference. And, as his thinking progressed,\nPeirce came ever more clearly to see that there are three distinct and\nmutually incommensurable measures of imperfection of certitude. Only\none was probability. The other two he called\n\u201cverisimilitude\u201d (or \u201clikelihood\u201d) and\n\u201cplausibility\u201d. Each of the three measures was associated\nwith one of his types of argument. Probability he associated with\ndeduction. Verisimilitude he associated with induction. And\nplausibility he associated with abduction. Let us look more closely at\neach of these three distinct measures of uncertainty.\n\n\nBy the time Peirce wrote on probability, the concept and its calculus\nwere well over two hundred years old. The probability calculus itself\nhad become more or less standardized by Peirce\u2019s time, and indeed\nPeirce\u2019s own axioms for the calculus are more or less the same that\nKolmogoroff gives for his \u201celementary theory of\nprobability.\u201d By contrast with the calculus, the philosophical\ntheory of the meaning of probability was hotly disputed. Two sides to\nthe dispute existed. There were the subjectivists, or\n\u201cconceptualists,\u201d as Peirce designated them. These\nbelieved that probability was a measure of the strength of belief\nactually accorded to a proposition or a measure of the degree of\nrational belief that ought to be accorded to a proposition. Among the\ndefenders of this sort of view, Augustus de Morgan and Adolphe\nQuetelet were major figures.  And there were the objectivists, or\n\u201cmaterialists,\u201d as Peirce designated them. These believed\nthat probability was a measure of the relative frequency with which an\nevent of some specific sort repeatedly happened.  John Venn was a\nmajor defender of this sort of view. Pierre Simon Laplace had spoken\nsometimes in a subjectivist way, sometimes in an objectivist way; but\nhis arguments basically depended on a subjectivist interpretation of\nprobability.\n\n\nPeirce vigorously attacked the subjectivist view of de Morgan and\nothers to the effect that probability is merely a measure of our level\nof confidence or strength of belief. He allowed that the logarithm of\nthe odds of an event might be used to assess the degree of rational\nbelief that should be accorded to an event, but only provided that the\nodds of the event were determined by the objective relative frequency\nof the event. In other words, Peirce suggested that any justifiable\nuse of subjectivism in connection with probability theory must\nultimately rest on quantities obtained by means of an objectivist\nunderstanding of probability.\n\n\nRather than holding that probability is a measure of degree of\nconfidence or belief, then, Peirce adopted an objectivist notion of\nprobability that he explicitly likened to the doctrine of John\nVenn. Indeed, he even held that probability is actually a notion with\nclear empirical content and that there are clear empirical procedures\nfor ascertaining that content.  First, he held, that that to which a\nprobability is assigned, insofar as the notion of probability is used\nscientifically, is not a proposition or an event or a state; nor is it\na type of event or state.  Rather, what is assigned a probability is\nan argument, an argument having premisses (Peirce insisted on\nthis spelling rather than the spelling \u201cpremises.\u201d) and a\nconclusion. Peirce\u2019s view in this regard is virtually\nindistinguishable from the view of Kolmogoroff that all probabilities\nare conditional probabilities. Second, Peirce held that, in order to\nascertain the probability of a particular argument, the observer notes\nall occasions on which all of its premisses are true, case by case,\njust as they come under observation. For each of these occasions the\nobserver notes whether the conclusion is true or not. The observer\nkeeps a running tally, the ongoing ratio whose numerator is the number\nof occasions so far observed on which the conclusion as well as the\npremisses are true and whose denominator is the number of occasions so\nfar observed on which the premisses are true irrespective of whether\nor not the conclusion is also true. At each observation the observer\ncomputes this ratio, which obviously encompasses all the observer\u2019s\npast observations of occasions on which the premisses are true. The\nprobability of the argument in question is defined by Peirce to be the\nlimit of the crucial ratio as the number of observations tends to grow\ninfinitely large (if this limit exists).\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s earliest account of the meaning of probability, then, is a\nversion of what is called the \u201clong run relative frequency\nview\u201d of probability. Late in his philosophical career, about\n1910, Peirce found fault with his earliest views on account of their\nfailure to make clear just how the occasions of observation are to be\nchosen.  He also emphasized that probability judgments are judgments\nabout what he called \u201cwould-be\u2019s.\u201d For this reason Peirce\nis often considered to be the originator of the sort of\n\u201cpropensity view\u201d of probability that is associated with\nKarl Popper. One should not, however, think that viewing Peirce as a\npropensity theorist is in conflict with viewing him as some sort of\nlong term relative frequency theorist. Rather, Peirce\u2019s view seems to\nbe that the propensity in question, when its sense is spelled out in\naccord with the pragmatic (or: pragmaticistic) theory of meaning, is a\ndispositional property that manifests itself in the set of concrete\nfacts that amount to a certain long term relative frequency tending\ntoward a certain limit as the number of appropriate occasions of\nobservation increases indefinitely.\n\n\nThere is an interesting connection between Peirce\u2019s tychism, his view that \nthere is objective spontaneity in the universe, and the foregoing account \nof probability. For Peirce understood the universe of appearances as a logical \nprocess, somewhat in the same manner that Hegel understood the universe of \nappearances as the phenomenology of spirit. He tended to consider a given \nstate of the universe as being a given set of premisses, so to say, of a \npossible inference. Then a subsequent state of the universe could be seen as \nbeing the conclusion of an actual inference. Thus Peirce tended to see the \nuniverse of appearances as bringing itself into being by a process \nthat is ultimately logical. The world, as it were, evolves by abducing,\ndeducing, and inducing itself. It is in some sense Hegel\u2019s \n\u201cThought thinking thought.\u201d\n\n\nAlong with his attack on a subjectivist account of probability, Peirce\nalso attacked the use of what came to be called the method of\n\u201cinverse probabilities\u201d as a way of solving the problem of\ninduction. In the process, he also excoriated the theoretical work, in\nthis connection, of de Morgan and Adolphe Quetelet (the Belgian\ncriminologist and early user of statistical analysis in\nsociology). Induction, as we have seen, Peirce counted as an inference\nfrom sample to population. The method of inverse probabilities offers\nitself as a way of calculating the (conditional) probability that a\npopulation has a trait in a certain proportion given that a sample\ndrawn from that population has the trait in that proportion. It\nproposes to calculate this conditional probability by applying the\nso-called \u201cBayes\u2019s Theorem\u201d in order to express it in\nterms of the (inverse conditional) probability that the sample has the\ntrait in the crucial proportion given that the population has the\ntrait in the crucial proportion. In the expression of the first\nconditional probability in terms of the second conditional\nprobability, however, there occur certain quantities, known as the\n\u201cBayesian prior probabilities.\u201d What Peirce pointed out is\nthat there is no way to assign any quantities in a rational fashion to\nthe requisite Bayesian prior probabilities. The appearance that one\ndoes have a reason for assigning particular quantities results only\nfrom an illicit substitution of subjective probabilities for the\nneeded objectivist probabilities. What the user of the method of\ninverse probabilities does is to equate complete lack of information\nabout something with the claim that all possibilities must have equal\nprobabilities. This equation was called \u201cthe principle of\ninsufficient reason\u201d in the nineteenth century; John Maynard\nKeynes later named it \u201cthe principle of indifference.\u201d\nThis principle is, however, completely irrational without a dependence\non a subjectivist account of probability.  What we need, however, is\nobjective probabilities, and so we have no reason for assigning any\nparticular values to the Bayesian prior probabilities. Only \u201cif\nuniverses were as plenty as blackberries,\u201d wrote Peirce, would\nthe analysis of de Morgan and Quetelet make any sense.\n\n\nIn rejecting Bayesianism and the method of inverse probabilities,\nPeirce argued that in fact no probability at all can be assigned to\ninductive arguments. Instead of probability, a different measure of\nimperfection of certitude must be assigned to inductive arguments:\nverisimilitude or likelihood. In explaining this notion Peirce offered\nan account of hypothesis-testing that is equivalent to standard\nstatistical hypothesis-testing. In effect we get an account of\nconfidence intervals and choices of statistical significance for\nrejecting null hypotheses. Such ideas became standard only in the\ntwentieth century as a result of the work of R. A. Fisher, Jerzy\nNeyman, and others. But already by 1878, in his paper \u201cThe\nProbabilitiy of Induction,\u201d Peirce had worked out the whole\nmatter. (This topic has been discussed expertly by Deborah Mayo, who\nalso has shown that the error-correction implicit in statistical\nhypothesis-testing is intimately affiliated with Peirce\u2019s notion of\nscience as self-correcting and convergent to \u201cthe\ntruth.\u201d)\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s accounts of his third type of deviance from perfect\ncertitude, namely plausibility, are much sketchier than his accounts\nof probability and verisimilitude. Unlike the other two forms of\nuncertainty, which can be spelled out mathematically with great\nprecision, plausibility seems to be capable of only a qualitative\naccount, even though plausibility does seem to comes in greater and\nlesser degree.  The question of the plausibility of a claim arises,\napparently, only in contexts in which one is seeking to adduce an\nexplanatory hypothesis for some actual fact that is surprising. The\nkey point is that the hypothesis must be plausible in order to taken\nseriously.  If we were, for example, to come upon a lump of ice in the\nmiddle of a desert, we might plausibly say that perhaps someone put it\nthere, or perhaps a freak storm had left a great hailstone. But we\nwould not plausibly say that it had been thrown off a flying saucer\nthat previously had swooped through. It should be obvious that the\nnotion of plausibility is a difficult one, which strongly invites\nfurther analysis but which is not easy to analyze in technical\ndetail.\n",
