    "main_text": "Philosophy || Philosophy of Gender\n3.7 Philosophy of Gender\n\nQuestions of gender and sexuality suffuse the entire corpus of\nScud\u00e9ry. Her prolix novels celebrate an egalitarian love\nbetween men and women. Despite their exotic settings, they condemn the\ntypical oppressions endured by the era\u2019s women: forced marriage,\nabduction, and domestic violence. Her fictitious orations emphasize\nthe right of women to exercise political authority.\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s defense of the right of women to participate in\nthe public sphere of civil society is particularly emphatic in her\nwritings focused on the figure of the poet Sappho. As Newman argues in\nher edition of these writings (2003), The Story of Sappho,\nembedded in the novel Artam\u00e8ne or the Great Cyrus, and\nthe Harangue of Sappho, the twentieth of the speeches\npresented in Illustrious Women or Heroic Harangues, clearly\nindict the social repression of women. The institution of marriage\nitself serves as an object of censure.\n\nThe Harangue of Sappho presents Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\nphilosophy of gender in lapidary form. Speaking to her auditor Erinne,\nSappho condemns the denial of women\u2019s rights to education and\nself-expression through a cult of false humility. A distorted virtue\nof modesty has reduced women to silence. \n\n\nYou must overcome the doubt concerning yourself that is planted in\nyour soul. It is this false modesty which prevents you from employing\nyour mind to achieve all that it is capable of attempting.\n[FI, 1, 423\u2013424] \n\n\nThis anti-intellectual modesty, which women are supposed to cultivate\nas one of the distinguishing traits of their sex, has only made women\ndoubt their own worth. Modesty has condemned self-expression to the\nstatus of a sin.\n\nEven graver in this silencing of women is society\u2019s sharp\ndemarcation between gender roles in the public square. Women are to\nexcel in the cultivation of physical beauty and the social graces; men\nare to excel in the pursuit of art and science. \n\n\nPeople who claim that beauty is woman\u2019s sphere and that the arts\nand letters and all the liberal and rarified sciences belong to\nmen\u2014and that we women are barred from them\u2014are very far\nfrom either truth or justice. [FI,1: 424] \n\n\nTo contest this gendered differentiation in the sphere of study and\nwork, women must recognize that the set of beliefs supporting this\nsexual segregation is simply a \u201ccustom and corruption of our\ntime\u201d [FI,  426]. In fact, society offers numerous\ncounter-examples of men who focus on the development of physical\nbeauty and social charm and of women who excel in scientific culture\nand intellectual debate. Both men and women can develop the powers of\nanalysis and judgment as well as those of imagination. To refuse women\nthe right to develop their intellectual gifts is to oppose Nature\nitself, which has clearly equipped women with such capacities. \n\n\nThe gods have made nothing useless in all nature\u2026.Now, why\nshould we women be the only ones supposed to rebel against this\nnatural order as if we were ungrateful to the gods? Why should our\nminds be kept in a perpetual state of uselessness and\nmediocrity?\u2026.No reason could possibly justify the belief that\nwhat is infinitely admirable in itself is supposedly wrong and\ncriminal in ourselves. [FI,1: 432] \n\n\nThe development of women\u2019s intellectual capacity requires the\nrefutation of the social prejudices concerning gender differentiation.\nThis refutation must demonstrate how these damaging prejudices\ncontradict the order of nature itself.\n\nTo liberate women\u2019s intellectual gifts, Scud\u00e9ry\nprivileges the role of writing. In writing and publishing her work, a\nwoman attracts acclaim in the future as well as in the present. The\nact of writing is far superior to being written about by others in the\nfashionable literary portraits of the time. \n\n\nIt is better to grant immortality to others than to receive it from\nothers. It is better to find glory within yourself than to borrow it\nfrom somewhere else\u2026.Poetry has many advantages. You only have\nto encourage others to speak about you in order to make yourself known\nto posterity. If you simply speak with good grace, you will be known\nwell enough\u2026.You have only to condemn the vices of your time\nand society will not fail to laud you. [FI,1: 438] \n\n\nThe writing of social criticism is especially appropriate for women\nwho have overcome the social stereotypes imprisoning women in the\nprivate sphere of sentiment. \n",
