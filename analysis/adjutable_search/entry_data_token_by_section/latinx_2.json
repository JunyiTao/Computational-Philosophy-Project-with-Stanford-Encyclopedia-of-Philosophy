    "main_text": "Current Issues || Social and Political Philosophy\n1.2 Social and Political Philosophy\n\nIf the first decade of twenty-first century work on Latinx philosophy\nwas dominated by questions of identity\u2014in particular, of\nspecifying the nature, experiences, and even preferred term for\nLatinxs\u2014the second decade might best be characterized as\ninvolving the arrival of questions in political philosophy (including\ncitizenship and immigration) and the development of a more pronounced\nmetaphilosophical sensibility. \n\nWrit large, a good deal of recent Latinx philosophy has centered on\nthe consequences of demographic changes in the United States, and on\nreactions to them. Philosophers have argued that Latinxs constitute\ndistinctive challenges for conventional understandings of social and\npolitical theory in the United States (Mendieta 2003; Gracia 2005;\nAlcoff 2006). In particular, the \u201cbrowning\u201d of America\n(Sundstrom 2008) and the implications of these demographic\ntransformation for whiteness (Alcoff 2015; Mendoza 2017) have been\nsubjects of important discussions.\n\nThis engagement with questions in political philosophy is not entirely\nnew, of course. For example, there has been ongoing philosophical\ndebate about the status of Latinxs with respect to affirmative action\n(Corlett 2003; Gracia 2008; McGary 2013; Gracia 2013). Within the\nrecent expansion of work in political philosophy, however, two issues\nhave emerged as particularly salient: citizenship and immigration\nethics.\n\nCitizenship, and its entanglement with race, has a long and\ncomplicated history within Latin America (Quijano 2000, von Vacano\n2012). The same is true in the United States, where the boundaries of\ncitizenship of oftentimes been carved with an eye towards the racial\nconsequences of those boundaries (Silva 2015a). The upshot of these\ncomplex but distinct histories is that Latinx populations sometimes\nstand in systematically produced situations of unorthodox citizenship.\nFor example, Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but those living on the\nisland cannot vote in US presidential elections. The Tohono\nO\u2019odham Nation, recognized by the US Bureau of Indian Affairs,\nis a tribal group divided by the US/Mexico border. Members born from\nthose enrolled in the tribe on the US side are US citizens, even if\nthey are born in Mexico and live with their fellow tribe members who\nare Mexican citizens (Luger 2018).\n\nMore generally, immigration rights, border politics, and the status of\npopulations that move across national boundaries have been the subject\nof particularly sustained discussions within Latinx philosophy\n(Cisneros 2013; Mendoza 2016; Reed-Sandoval 2016a; Orosco 2016a).\nMendoza (2016), for example, has argued that even if we suppose that\nnation states have some right to control their borders, it does not\nfollow that immigration enforcement is permissible or ethically\ndesirable. Reed-Sandoval (2016b) has argued that some populations\nwithin the larger web of immigration patterns (specific Oaxacan\ncommunities, in particular) have distinctive rights of migration,\ngiven their nature as a transborder community.\n",
