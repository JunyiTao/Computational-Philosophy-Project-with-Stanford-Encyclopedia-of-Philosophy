    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nCharles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Br\u00e8de et de Montesquieu,\nwas born on January 19th, 1689 at La Br\u00e8de, near Bordeaux, to a\nnoble and prosperous family. He was educated at the Oratorian\nColl\u00e8ge de Juilly, received a law degree from the University of\nBordeaux in 1708, and went to Paris to continue his legal studies. On\nthe death of his father in 1713 he returned to La Br\u00e8de to\nmanage the estates he inherited, and in 1715 he married Jeanne de\nLartigue, a practicing Protestant, with whom he had a son and two\ndaughters. In 1716 he inherited from his uncle the title Baron de La\nBr\u00e8de et de Montesquieu and the office of Pr\u00e9sident\n\u00e0 Mortier in the Parlement of Bordeaux, which was at the time\nchiefly a judicial and administrative body. For the next eleven years\nhe presided over the Tournelle, the Parlement's criminal division, in\nwhich capacity he heard legal proceedings, supervised prisons, and\nadministered various punishments including torture. During this time\nhe was also active in the Academy of Bordeaux, where he kept abreast\nof scientific developments, and gave papers on topics ranging from the\ncauses of echoes to the motives that should lead us to pursue the\nsciences.\n\n In 1721 Montesquieu published the Persian Letters, which was\nan instant success and made Montesquieu a literary celebrity. (He\npublished the Persian Letters anonymously, but his authorship\nwas an open secret.) He began to spend more time in Paris, where he\nfrequented salons and acted on behalf of the Parlement and the Academy\nof Bordeaux. During this period he wrote several minor works:\nDialogue de Sylla et d'Eucrate (1724), R\u00e9flexions sur\nla Monarchie Universelle (1724), and Le Temple de Gnide\n(1725). In 1725 he sold his life interest in his office and resigned\nfrom the Parlement. In 1728 he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie\nFran\u00e7aise, despite some religious opposition, and shortly\nthereafter left France to travel abroad. After visiting Italy,\nGermany, Austria, and other countries, he went to England, where he\nlived for two years. He was greatly impressed with the English\npolitical system, and drew on his observations of it in his later\nwork.\n\n On his return to France in 1731, troubled by failing eyesight,\nMontesquieu returned to La Br\u00e8de and began work on his\nmasterpiece, The Spirit of the Laws. During this time he also\nwrote Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans\nand of their Decline, which he published anonymously in 1734. In\nthis book he tried to work out the application of his views to the\nparticular case of Rome, and in so doing to discourage the use of Rome\nas a model for contemporary governments. Parts of\nConsiderations were incorporated into The Spirit of the\nLaws, which he published in 1748. Like the Persian Letters,\nThe Spirit of the Laws was both controversial and immensely\nsuccessful. Two years later he published a Defense of the Spirit of\nthe Laws to answer his various critics. Despite this effort, the\nRoman Catholic Church placed The Spirit of the Laws on the\nIndex of Forbidden Books in 1751. In 1755, Montesquieu died of a fever\nin Paris, leaving behind an unfinished essay on taste for the\nEncyclop\u00e9die of Diderot and D'Alembert.\n",
