    "main_text": "Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views || Evidence vs. dispositions\n4.5 Evidence vs. dispositions\n\nMaria Lasonen-Aarnio (2020) argues that the conflict comes from two\ndifferent modes of evaluation which we can apply to Aisha\u2019s\ncase. In addition to evaluating whether believers have correctly\nfollowed the epistemic requirements that apply to them, or have\ncorrectly accommodated their evidence, we can also evaluate their\nbelief-forming dispositions. If Aisha holds onto her belief about\nG, while recognizing the danger of hypoxia in her own case,\nshe is responding appropriately to her evidence and is (if her belief\nis formed in the right way) following the requirements that apply to\nher. But she is also manifesting a disposition that is unlikely to\nserve her well in the long term: ignoring what appears to be\na conclusive reason for belief (her belief that she\u2019s likely to\nbe hypoxic, and therefore likely to be responding inappropriately to\nher evidence) will often involve actual conclusive reasons\nfor belief. We can criticize Aisha for manifesting this disposition,\neven if this particular case is not one of the situations in which it\ngoes wrong. (A relevant comparison here is Rule versus Act\nUtilitarianism: a good rule might occasionally lead to imperfect\noutcomes, whereas a good outcome might occasionally be the result of a\nbad rule. See Coates [2012] for a similar suggestion about rules in\nthis context.)\n\nSmithies (2019) defends a similar view, discussed in more detail in\nthe next subsection.\n",
