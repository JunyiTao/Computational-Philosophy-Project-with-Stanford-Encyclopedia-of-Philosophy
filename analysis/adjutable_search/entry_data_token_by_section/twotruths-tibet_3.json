Gelug\n\nGelug\u2019s (Dge lugs) theory of the two truths is campioned by Tsongkhapa\nLobsang Dragpa (Tsong khapa Blo bzang grags pa, 1357\u20131419).\nTsongkhapa\u2019s theory is adopted, expanded and defended in the works of\nhis immediate disciples\u2014Gyaltsab J\u00e9 (Rgyal tshab Rje,\n1364\u20131432), Khedrub J\u00e9 (Mkhas grub Rje, 1385\u20131438),\nGend\u00fcn Drub (Dge \u2018dun grub,1391\u20131474)\u2014and other\ngreat Gelug thinkers such as Sera Jets\u00fcn Ch\u00f6kyi Gyaltsen (Se\nra Rje tsun Chos kyi rgyal tshan, 1469\u20131544), Panchen S\u00f6nam\nDragpa (Pa\u1e47 chen Bsod nams grags pa,1478\u20131554), Panchen\nLobsang Ch\u00f6kyi Gyaltsen (Pa\u1e47 chen Blo bzang chos kyi rgyal\ntshan,1567\u20131662), Jamyang Shepai Dorje (\u2018Jam dbyangs Bzhad\nba'i Rdo rje, 1648\u20131722), Changkya R\u00f6lpai Dorje (Lcang skya\nRol pa'i rdo rje, 1717\u201386), K\u00f6nchog Jigm\u00e9 Wangpo\n(Kon mchog \u2018jigs med dbang po, 1728\u201391), and many others\nscholars.\n\nGelug maintains that \u201cobjects of knowledge\u201d (shes\nbya) are the basis for dividing the two truths (Tsongkhapa\n 1984b:176).[4]\n This means that the two truths relate to \u201ctwo objects of\nknowledge,\u201d the idea it takes from the statement of the Buddha\nfrom Discourse on Meeting of the Father and the Son\n(Pit\u0101putrasam\u0101gama\n S\u016btra)[5]\n By object of knowledge Gelug means an object that is\ncognizable (blo'i yul du bya rung ba). It must be an object\nof cognitive processes in general ranging from those of ordinary\nsentient beings through to those of enlightened beings. This\ndefinition attempts to capture any thing knowable in the broadest\npossible sense. Since the Buddha maintains knowledge of the two truths\nto be necessary for awakening, the understanding of the two truths\nmust constitute an exhaustive understanding of all objects of\nknowledge.\n\nGelug\u2019s key argument to support this claim comes from its two-nature\ntheory in which it has been argued that every nominally (tha\nsnyad) or conventionally (kun rdzob) given phenomenon\npossesses dual natures: namely, the nominal (or conventional\nnature) and the ultimate nature. The conventional nature is\nunreal and deceptive while the ultimate nature is real and\nnondeceptive. Since two natures pertain to every phenomenon, the\ndivision of the two truths means the division of each entity into two\nnatures. Thus the division of the two truths, \u201creveals that it\nmakes sense to divide even the nature of a single entity, like a\nsprout, into dual natures\u2014its conventional and its ultimate\nnatures. It does not however show,\u201d as non-Gelug schools have\nit, \u201cthat the one nature of the sprout is itself divided into\ntwo truths in relation to ordinary beings (so skye) and to\nnoble beings (\u0101ryas)\u201d (Tsongkhapa 1984b: 173,\n1992: 406).\n\nThe relation of the two truths comes down to the way in which the\nsingle entity appears to cognitive processes\u2014deceptively and\nnondeceptively. The two natures correspond to these deceptive or\nnondeceptive modes of appearance. While they both belong to the same\nontological entity, they are epistemically or conceptually mutually\nexclusive. Take a sprout for instance. If it exists, it necessarily\nexhibits a dual nature, and yet those two natures cannot be\nontologically distinct. The ultimate nature of the sprout cannot be\nseparate from its conventional nature\u2014its color, texture, shape,\nextension, and so on. As an object of knowledge, the sprout retains\nits single ontological basis, but it is known through its two natures.\nThese two natures exclude one another so far as knowledge is\nconcerned. The cognitive process that knows the deceptive conventional\nnature of the sprout does not have direct access to its nondeceptive\nultimate nature. Similarly, the cognitive process that apprehends the\nnondeceptive ultimate nature of the sprout does not have direct access\nto its deceptive conventional nature. In Newland\u2019s words: \u201cA\ntable and its emptiness are a single entity. When an ordinary\nconventional mind takes a table as its object of observation, it sees\na table. When a mind of ultimate analysis searches for the table, it\nfinds the emptiness of the table. Hence, the two truths are posited in\nrelation to a single entity by way of the perspectives of the\nobserving consciousness. This is as close as Ge-luk-bas will come to\ndefining the two truths as perspectives\u201d (1992: 49).\n\nGelug\u2019s two-nature theory not only serves as the basic reference point\nfor its exposition of the basis of the division of the two truths,\ntheir meanings and definitions, but also serves as the basic\nontological reference for its account of the relationship between the\ntwo truths. Therefore Gelug proposes the view that the two truths are\nof single entity with distinct conceptual identities. This view is\nalso founded on the theory of the two natures. But how are the two\nnatures related? Are they identical or distinct? For Gelug argues that\nthere are only two possibilities: either the two natures are identical\n(ngo bo gcig) or distinct (ngo bo tha dad); there\ncannot be a third (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176). They are related in terms of\nbeing a single entity with distinct conceptual identities\u2014thus\nthey are both the same and different. Since the two natures are the\nbasis of the relationship between the two truths, the relationship\nbetween the two truths will reflect the relationship between the two\nnatures. Just as the two natures are of a same entity, ultimate truth\nand conventional truth are of same ontological status.\n\nGelug argues that the relationship between the two truths, therefore,\nthe two natures, is akin to the relationship between being conditioned\nand being impermanent (Tsongkhapa 1984b:176). It appropriates this\npoint from N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Bodhicittavivara\u1e47a,\nwhich states: \u201cReality is not perceived as separate from\nconventionality. The conventionality is explained to be empty. Empty\nalone is the conventionality, if one of them does not exist, neither\nwill the other, like being conditioned and being impermanent\u201d\n(v.67\u201368) (N\u0101g\u0101rjuna 1991:45\u201345, cited\nTsongkhapa, 1984b: 176; Khedrub J\u00e9 1992: 364). Commenting on\nthis passage from the Bodhicittavivara\u1e47a, Tsongkhapa\nargues that the first four lines (in original Tibetan verses) show\nthat things as they really are, are not ontologically distinct from\nthat of the conventionality. The latter two lines (in the original\nTibetan verse) show their relationship such that if one did not exist,\nneither could the other (med na mi \u2018bung ba'i \u2018brel\nba). This, in fact, he says, is equivalent to their being\nconstituted by a single-property relationship (bdag cig\npa'i \u2018brel ba). Therefore, like the case of being\nconditioned and being impermanent, the relation between the two truths\nis demonstrated as one of a single ontological identity (Tsongkhapa\n1984b: 176\u201377).\n\nThe way in which the two truths are related is thus analogous to the\nrelationship between being conditioned and being impermanent. They are\nontologically identical and mutually entailing. Just as a conditioned\nstate is not a result of impermanence, so emptiness is not a result of\nthe conventional truth (the five aggregates) or the destruction of the\nfive aggregates\u2014Hence in the Vimalak\u0131rtinirde\u015ba\nS\u016btra it is stated: \u201cMatter itself is void. Voidness\ndoes not result from the destruction of matter, but the nature of\nmatter is itself voidness\u201d (Vimalak\u012brti, 1991:74). The same\nprinciple applies in the case of consciousness and the emptiness of\nconsciousness, as well as to the rest of the five psychophysical\naggregates\u2014the aggregate and its emptiness are not causally\nrelated. For the causal relationship would imply either the aggregate\nis the cause, therefore its emptiness is the result, or the aggregate\nis the result, and its emptiness the cause. This would imply,\naccording to Gelug\u2019s reading, either the aggregate or the emptiness is\ntemporally prior to its counterpart, thus leading to the conlusion\nthat the conventional truth and ultimate truth exist independently of\neach other. Such a view is for Gelug is completely unacceptable.\n\nThe ontological identity between being conditioned and being\nimpermanent does not imply identity in all and every\nrespect. Insofar as their epistemic mode is concerned, conditioned and\nimpermanent phenomena are distinct and contrasting. The concept\nimpermanence always presents itself to the cognizing mind as\nmomentary instants, but not as conditioned. Similarly, the concept\nbeing-conditioned always presents itself to its cognizing\nmind as constituted by manifold momentary instants, but not as\nmoments. Thus it does not necessarily follow that the two truths are\nidentical in every respect just because they share a common\nontological identity. Where the modes of conceptual appearance are\nconcerned, ultimate nature and conventional nature are distinct. The\nconceptual mode of appearance of ultimate truth is nondeceptive and\nconsistent with its mode of existence, while that of conceptual mode\nof conventional truth is deceptive and inconsistent with its mode of\nexistence.\n\nConventional truth is uncritically confirmed by conventionally\nreliable cognitive process, whereas ultimate truth is critically\nconfirmed by ultimately reliable cognitive process. Hence, just as\nultimate truth is inaccessible to the conventionally reliable\ncognitive process for its uncritical mode of engagement, so, too, is\nconventional truth inaccessible to ultimately reliable cognitive\nprocess for its critical mode of engagement. This is how, in Gelug\u2019s\nview, the truths differ conceptually despite sharing a common\nontological entity. In summarizing Gelug\u2019s argument, Khedrub J\u00e9\nwrites: \u201cThe two truths are therefore of the same nature, but\ndifferent conceptual identities. They have a single-nature\nrelationship such that, if one did not exist, neither could the other,\njust like being conditioned and impermanent\u201d (1992: 364).\n\nThe two nature theory also supports Gelug\u2019s view that the truth is\ntwofold. Since the two natures of every conventional phenomenon\nprovide the ontological and epistemological foundation for each of the\ntruths, the division of truth into two is entirely appropriate. Both\nthe conventional and the ultimate are actual truths, and since the two\nnatures are mutually interlocking, neither of the two truths has\nprimacy over the other\u2014both have equal status, ontologically,\nepistemologically, and even soteriologically.\n\nGiven Gelug\u2019s stance on conventional truth as actual truth and its\nargument for the equal status of the two truths, Gelug must now\naddress the question: How can conventional truth, which is unreal\n(false) and deceptive, be truth (real) at all? In other words, how can\nthe two truths be of equal status given if conventional truth is\nunreal (false)? The success of Gelug\u2019s reply depends on its ability to\nmaintain harmony between the two truths, or their equal footing.There\nare several arguments by means of which Gelug defends this. The first,\nand the most obvious one, is the argument from the two-nature theory.\nIt argues since two truths are grounded in the dual nature of a single\nphenomenon, then \u201cjust as the ultimate reality of the sprout\n[for instance] is taken as characteristic of the sprout, hence it is\ndescribed as the sprout\u2019s nature, so, too,\u201d explains Tsongkhapa,\n\u201care the sprout\u2019s color, shape, etc., the sprout\u2019s\ncharacteristics. Therefore they too are its nature\u201d\n(1992: 406). Since the two natures are ontologically mutually\nentailing, the sprout\u2019s ultimate truth cannot exist ontologically\nseparate from its conventional truth, and vice versa. Neither truth\ncould exist without the other.\n\nThe most important argument Gelug advances for the unity of the two\ntruths draws upon an understanding of the compatible relation between\nconventional truth and dependent arising on the one hand, and between\nultimate truth and emptiness on the other. For Gelug emptiness and\ndependent arising are synonymous. The concept of emptiness is\nincoherent unless it means dependent arising, and equally the concept\nof dependent arising is incoherent unless it means emptiness of\nintrinsic reality. Gelug argues, as Tsongkhapa does in the Rten\n\u2018brel stod pa (In Praise of Dependent Arising, 1994a),\nsince emptiness means dependent arising, the emptiness of intrinsic\nreality and the efficacy of action and its agent are not\ncontradictory. If emptiness, however, is misinterpreted as\ncontradictory with dependent arising, then Gelug contends, there would\nbe neither action in empty phenomena, nor empty phenomena in action.\nBut that cannot be the case, for that would entail a rejection of both\nphenomena and action, a nihilistic view (v.11\u201312). Since there\nis no phenomenon other than what is dependently arisen, there is no\nphenomenon other than what is empty of intrinsic reality (v.15).\nUnderstood emptiness in this way, there is indeed no need to say that\nthey are noncontradictory\u2014the utter nonexistence of\nintrinsic reality and making sense of everything in the light of\nthe principle this arises depending on this (v.18). This is\nso because despite the fact that whatever is dependently arisen lacks\nintrinsic reality, and therefore empty, nonetheless its existence is\nillusion-like (v.27).\n\nSometimes Gelug varies its ontological argument slightly, as does\nTsongkhapa in the Lam gtso rnam gsum (The Three Principal\nPathways), to stressing the unity of the two truths in terms of\ntheir causal efficiency. It argues that empty phenomena is causally\nefficient is crucial in understanding the inextricable relationship\nbetween ultimate truth and conventional truth. The argument takes two\nforms: (1) appearance avoids realism\u2014the extreme of\nexistence, and (2) emptiness avoids inhilism\u2014the\nextreme of nonexistence. The former makes sense for Gelug\nbecause the appearance arises from causal conditions, and whatever\narises from the causal conditions is a non-eternal or non-permanent.\nWhen the causal conditions changes any thing that dependently arises\nfrom them also changes. Thus the appearance avoids the realism. The\nlatter makes sense because the empty phenomena arises from causal\nconditions, and whatever arise from the causal conditions is not a\nnon-existent, even though it lacks intrinsic reality. Only when the\ncausal conditions are satisfied do we see arising of the empty\nphenomena. Hence by understanding that the empty phenomenon itself is\ncausally efficient, the bearer of cause and effect, one is not robbed\nby the extreme view of nihilism (1985: 252).\n\nThe argument for the unity of the two truths also takes\nepistemological form which also rests on the idea that emptiness and\ndependently arising are unified. The knowledge of empty phenomena is\nconceptually interlinked with that of dependently arisen\nphenomena\u2014the latter is, in fact, founded on the former. To the\nextent that empty phenomena are understood in terms of relational and\ndependently arisen phenomena, to that extent empty phenomena are\nalways functional and causally effective. The phrase \u201cempty\nphenomena,\u201d although expressed negatively, is not negative in a\nmetaphysical sense\u2014it is not equivalent to no-thingness.\nAlthough the empty phenomenon appears to its cognizing consciousness\nnegatively and without any positive affirmation, it is nonetheless\nequivalent to a relational and dependently arisen phenomenon seen\ndeconstructively. Since seeing phenomena as empty does not violate the\ninevitable epistemic link with the understanding of phenomena as\ndependently arisen, and the converse also applies, so the unity\nbetween the two truths\u2014understanding things both as empty and as\ndependently arisen\u2014is still sustained.\n\nThe unity between the two truths, according to Gelug, does not apply\nmerely to ontological and epistemological issues; it applies equally\nto soteriology\u2014the practical means to the freedom from\nsuffering. As Jamyang Shepai Dorje argues that undermining either of\nthe two truths would result in a similar downfall\u2014a similar\neventual ruin. If, however, they are not undermined, the two are alike\ninsofar as the accomplishment of the two accumulations and the\nattainment of the two awakened bodies (k\u0101yas), and so forth, are\nconcerned. If one undermines conventional truth or denies it\u2019s\nreality, one would succumb to the extreme of nihilism, which would\nalso undermine the fruit and the means by which an awakened physical\nbody (r\u016bpak\u0101ya) is accomplished. It is therefore not\nsensible to approach the two truths with bias. Since this relation\ncontinues as a means to avoid falling into extremes, and also to\naccomplish the two accumulations and attain the two awakened bodies\n(k\u0101yas), it is imperative, says Jamyang Shepai Dorje, that the\ntwo truths be understood as mutually interrelated (1992:\n898\u201399).\n\nOne could object Gelug\u2019s position as follows: If the two natures are\nontologically identical, why is conventional truth unreal and\ndeceptive, while ultimate truth real and nondeceptive? To this Gelugs\nreplies that \u201cnondeceptive is the mode of reality (bden\ntshul) of the ultimate. That is, ultimate truth does not deceive\nthe world by posing one mode of appearance while existing in another\nmode\u201d (1992: 411). Ultimate truth is described as\nultimate, not because it is absolute or higher than\nconventional truth, but simply because of its consistent character,\ntherefore non-deceptive\u2014its mode of appearance and its mode of\nbeing are the same\u2014in contrast with the inconsistent (therefore\ndeceptive) character of conventional truth. Ultimate truth is\nnondeceptive for the same reason. The premise follows because to the\ncognizing consciousness, conventional truth presents itself as\ninherently or instrinsically real. It appears to be substance, or\nessence, and therefore it deceives ordinary beings. Insofar\nas conventional truth presents itself as more than\nconventional\u2014as inherently real\u2014they deceive the ordinary\nbeings. We take them to be what they are not\u2014to be intrinsically\nand objectively real. In that sense, they are unreal. \u201cBut to\nthe extent that we understand them as dependently arisen, empty,\ninterdependent phenomena,\u201d as Garfield explains, \u201cthey\nconstitute a conventional truth\u201d (1995: 208).\n\nAnother objection may be advanced as follows: Gelug\u2019s position\ncontradicts the Buddha\u2019s teachings since it is not possible to\nreconcile Gelug\u2019s view that there are two actual truths with the\nBuddha\u2019s declaration that nirv\u0101\u1e47a is the only\n truth.[6]\n For its answer to this objection Gelug appropriates\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s\nYukti\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dik\u0101v\u1e5btti which states\nthat nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not like conditioned phenomena, which\ndeceives the childish by presenting false appearances. For the\nexistence of nirv\u0101\u1e47a is always consistent with its\ncharacteristic of the nonarising nature. Unlike conditioned phenomena,\nit never appears, even to the childish, as having a nature of arising\n(skye ba'i ngo bo). Since nirv\u0101\u1e47a is always\nconsistent with the mode of existence of nirv\u0101\u1e47a, it is\nexplained as the noble truth. Yet this explanation is afforded\nstrictly in the terms of worldly conventions (1983:\n14\u201315ff, cited in Tsongkhapa 1992: 312, Khedrub J\u00e9 1992:\n360).\n\nFor Gelug the crucial point here, as Candrak\u012brti emphasizes, is\nthat nirv\u0101\u1e47a is the truth strictly in terms of worldly\nconventions. Gelug recognizes this linguistic convention as a\nhighly significant to the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika system and it insists\non conformity with the worldly conventions for the the following\nreasons. First, just as an illusion, a mirror image, etc., are real in\nan ordinary sense, despite the fact that they are deceptive and\nunreal, so, too, conventional phenomena in the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\nMadhyamaka sense are conventionally real, and can even be said to\nconstitute truths, despite being recognized by the M\u0101dhyamikas\nthemselves as unreal and deceptive. Second, because the concept\nultimate truth is also taken from its ordinary convention,\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a is spoken of as ultimate on the ground of\nits nondeceptive nature, in the sense that its mode of existence is\nconsistent with its mode of appearance. The nondeceptive nature of the\nempty phenomenon itself constitutes its reality, and so it is\nconventionally described as ultimate in the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\nsystem.\n\nThus Gelug asserts that neither of the two truths is more or less\nsignificant than the other. Indeed, while the illusion only makes\nsense as illusion in relation to that which is not illusion, the\nreflection only makes sense as reflection in relation to that which is\nreflected. So, too, does the real only make sense as real in relation\nto the illusion, the thing reflected in relation to its reflection.\nThis also holds in the case of discussions about the ultimate nature\nof things, such as the being of the sprout\u2014it only makes sense\ninasmuch as it holds in discussions of ordinary phenomena. The only\ncriterion that determines a thing\u2019s truth in the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\nMadhyamaka system, according to Gelug, is the causal effectiveness of\nthe thing as opposed to mere heuristic significance. The\nsprout\u2019s empty mode of being and its being as appearance are both\ntruths, insofar as both are causally effective, and thus both\nfunctional.\n\nThe two truths, understood as, respectively, the empty and the\ndependently arisen characters of phenomena, are on equal footing\naccording to Gelug. Nevertheless these truths have different\ndesignations\u2014the sprout\u2019s empty mode is always described as\n\u201cultimate truth,\u201d while the conventional properties, such\nas color and shape, are described as \u201cconventional\ntruths.\u201d The former is accepted as nondeceptive truth\nwhile the sprout\u2019s conventional properties are accepted as\ndeceptive or false truth, despite common sense\ndictating that they are true and real.\n\nIn conclusion Gelug\u2019s theory of the two truths is based on one\nfundamental thesis that each conventionally real phenomenon satisfies\nthe definitions of both truths for each phenomenon, as it sees it,\npossesses two natures that serve as the basis of the definitions of\nthe two truths. The two truths are conceptual distinctions applied to\na particular conventionally real phenomenon, and every conventionally\nreal phenomenon fulfills the criterion of both truths because each\nphenomenon constitutes these two natures they are not merely\none specific nature of a phenomenon mirrored in two different\nperspectives. As each phenomenon possesses two natures, so each\nverifying cognitive process has a different nature as its referent,\neven though there is only one ontological entity and one cognitive\nagent involved.\n",
