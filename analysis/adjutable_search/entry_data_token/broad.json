Broad\u2019s early interests were in science and\nmathematics. Despite being successful in these he came to believe that\nhe would never be a first-rate scientist, and turned to philosophy.\nBroad\u2019s interests were exceptionally wide-ranging. He devoted\nhis philosophical acuity to the mind-body problem, the nature of\nperception, memory, introspection, and the unconscious, to the nature\nof space, time and causation. He also wrote extensively on the\nphilosophy of probability and induction, ethics, the history of\nphilosophy and the philosophy of religion. The ample scope and scale\nof Broad\u2019s work is impressive. In addition he nourished an\ninterest in parapsychology\u2014a subject he approached with the\ndisinterested curiosity and scrupulous care that is characteristic of\nhis philosophical work.\n\nBroad did not have \u201ca philosophy\u201d\u2014if by that phrase\nis meant highly original philosophical theories, and a highly original\nway of approaching philosophical problems. He writes: \u201cI have\nnothing worth calling a system of philosophy of my own, and there is\nno philosopher of whom I should be willing to reckon myself a faithful\nfollower\u201d (1924, p. 77). The reader is nonetheless likely to\nreap philosophical insights from Broad\u2019s manner of meticulously\nsetting out and carefully assessing the theories that prima\nfacie provide solutions to a given philosophical problem. This\nfeature of his writings is aptly described by A. J. Ayer: \u201cThe\nsubject is discussed from every angle, the various possibilities\njudiciously set out, the precedents cited, the fallacious arguments\nexposed: nothing is skimped: looking for reason, we are not fobbed off\nwith rhetoric\u201d (Part of my Life, 1977, pp.\n117\u20138). Broad combines fairness, astuteness as well as rare\npowers of observation.\n\nPhilosophers who influenced Broad were (apart from the great\nphilosophers of the past) his teachers at Cambridge, Russell and\nMoore, and J. M. E. McTaggart and W. E. Johnson; at St. Andrew\u2019s\nhe received important additional influence from G. F. Stout and A. E.\nTaylor. The diversity of their thought is mirrored in Broad\u2019s\nown exceptional range of interests.\n\nBroad led a relatively uneventful life\u2014\u201cnot unlike,\u201d\nhe says in his \u201cAutobiography,\u201d \u201cthat of a monk in a\nmonastery\u201d (1959b, p. 67). He hadn\u2019t been out of the\nBritish Isles until 1946 when he visited Sweden\u2014a country he\n\u201cfell in love with,\u201d and returned to nearly every year. On\na professional level he made acquaintances with several Swedish\nphilosophers (such as Konrad-Marc Wogau at Uppsala University). In the\nacademic year 1953\u20134 Broad visited the University of Michigan at\nAnn Arbor and the University of California at Los Angeles. He writes\nwith great warmth of the \u201ckindness and hospitality\u201d with\nwhich he was received, and adds with characteristic modesty: \u201cIt\nwas good fun to be treated as a great philosopher\u201d (1959b).\nBroad was a homosexual, and never married.\n", "toc": [{"#BriChrLifWor": "1.

Perception\n\nBroad dealt with perception in several works. He is well known as an\nadvocate of The Theory of Representational Realism, according to which\nour perceptions are indirect cognitive transactions with the\nworld: a perceptual experience of a worldly object is not an immediate\nawareness of the object itself, but mediated by an immediate awareness\nof a sensum. For example, when we see a coin from a certain\nangle we are immediately aware of an elliptical sensum.\n2.1 Na\u00efve Realism Delineated\n\nBroad\u2019s treatment of perception in The Mind and Its Place in\nNature sets off with a careful description of Na\u00efve Realism.\nAnd this seems a suitable place to begin our exposition of his theory\nof perception. What, then, does Na\u00efve Realism say? To\npre-philosophical reflection perception seem to provide us with some\nsort of immediate cognitive contact with a physical object, for\nexample a bell. Consider a situation where we perceive a bell. Compare\nthis situation with one where we are merely thinking of a bell. There\nis a deep difference between the situations. We could \u201cvaguely\nexpress one part of this difference by saying that in the perceptual\nsituation we are \u2018in more immediate touch with\u2019 the bell\nthan in the thought-situation\u201d (1925, p. 144).\n\nThis rough and ready picture of the Na\u00efve Realist view must,\nhowever, be slightly modified. Suppose we visually perceive an apple.\nClearly there is a sense in which we do not perceive \u201call\u201d\nof the apple. There is a sense in which we are aware of only a\npart of its surface; and we are (in that sense) aware only of\nthe sensible colour of that part but not of its sensible temperature.\nThus perception provides us with a cognitive contact a part of the\napple, but no more. It is, then, strictly speaking only a part of the\napple with which we are acquainted; it is only a part of the\napple that is sensuously manifested to us. (1925, pp.\n148\u201350.)\n\nBroad does not equate or identify the perception of a worldly object\nwith the sort of immediate acquainting awareness we have (or seem to\nhave) with its facing surface (pace Chisholm, 1957, p. 154).\nHe is, on the contrary, careful to point out that the experience\nfeatures more than this awareness: it also has an intentional\ncontent. Broad designates this the external reference of\nthe experience. By virtue of its external reference the experience of\nthe apple represents the sensuously manifested constituent as an\nintegral part of a larger spatio-temporal whole, having a whole array\nof properties not sensuously manifested to us. (1925, pp.\n150\u20134.)\n\nWhat is the nature of the external reference? Broad warns against the\nrisk of unduly \u201cintellectualising\u201d perception. The\nexternal reference is not reached by inference from what is\nsensuously manifested; nor is it a belief or\njudgement simply accompanying the awareness of the manifested\nconstituent: \u201cAt the purely perceptual level, people do not have\nthe special experience called \u2018belief\u2019 or\n\u2018judgment\u2019\u201d (1925, p.\n 153).[1]\n2.2 Prehension: the Core Notion of Perceptual Immediacy\n\nWhen we visually perceive the apple we have an experience in which its\nfacing red surface is a sensuously manifested objective constituent;\nwe perceive the apple but are, strictly speaking, only acquainted with\na portion of\n it.[2]\n Broad sometimes prefers to say that we prehend the facing\nsurface (or ostensibly prehend the surface). Now the notion of\nprehension is fundamental for an understanding of Na\u00efve Realism\nas well as Representational Realism, so it seems advisable to briefly\ntake a somewhat closer look on Broad\u2019s account of it.\n\nBroad does not think it is possible to give a strict definition of\nphrases such as \u201cS prehends x as red\u201d or\nthe equivalent phrase \u201cx sensibly presents itself to\nS as\n red\u201d.[3]\n What one can do is to contrast the notion of prehension with other\nnotions: \u201cThe meaning of these phrases cannot be defined, it can\nonly be exemplified. One thing that is certain is that to prehend\nx as red is utterly different from judging that it\nis red or knowing that it is red\u201d (1952a, p. 13;\nitalics in original). For example, in the dark and with my eyes shut I\nmay very well judge (or know) that the apple is red. But in such\nconditions I am \u201cnot prehending anything as red, or, what is\nprecisely equivalent, nothing is sensibly presented to me as\nred\u201d (ibid, p. 14). Broad notes that this is\nsubstantiated by the fact that a cat or a dog that lacked concepts\nmight, it seems, have a prehension of something as red even though it\ncannot (lacking the requisite concepts) literally know or judge that\nit is red.\n\nPrehension is, however, intimately related to knowledge. Broad asks us\nto consider a subject \u201cwhich has appropriate general concepts\nand is capable of making judgements and knowing facts\u201d. Suppose\nthis subject prehends a certain particular object as red. Then this\n\u201csuffices to enable him to know the fact that it is\nred. Whether he does or does not actually contemplate this\nfact at the time depends on various contingent circumstances\u201d\n(1952a, p. 14; Broad\u2019s\n emphasis).[4]\n2.3 Na\u00efve Realism Dismantled\n\nNa\u00efve Realism, properly articulated, says that when we perceive a\nphysical object it is only a part of the apple that is sensuously\nmanifested to us: this, and only this, is an objective constituent in\nthe perceptual situation. Now can this view be defended? Broad does\nnot think so. He levels several arguments against Na\u00efve Realism,\ntwo of which will receive attention here.\n\nThe Argument from Hallucination. Consider a\nveridical perception and compare it with a subjectively\nindistinguishable delusive or hallucinatory perception, for example\nthat of a drunkard hallucinating a pink rat. Neither a pink rat nor a\npart of a pink rat could be a sensuously manifested constituent in the\ndelusive situation.\n\nAnd, since there is no relevant internal difference between the\nveridical and the delusive perceptual situation, it is reasonable to\nsuppose that in no case does a perceptual situation contain\nas a constituent the physical object which corresponds to its\nepistemological object, even when there is such a physical object.\n(1925, p. 156; italics added.)\n\n\nIt might be held that the subjective indistinguishability of a\nveridical perceptual and a hallucinatory situation entails\nthat the experiences have an identical constitution (and that,\ntherefore, no material object is a constituent even in the veridical\nsituation). That is, however, not Broad\u2019s position: it\ncould be that a material object is an objectively\nmanifested constituent in a veridical situation (whilst not in the\nindistinguishable hallucinatory situation). He holds, however, that\nthat is not the more reasonable view of the matter.\n\nThe Argument from Illusion. Consider a person perceiving a\npenny from a series of slightly different angles and distances. He\nwould unhesitatingly assume that in each of the slightly differing\nperceptual situations the facing brownish surface of a certain penny\nis sensuously manifested to him. But in Broad\u2019s view this could\nnot be so: \u201cIf he carefully inspects the objective constituents\nof these perceptual situations he will certainly find that they seem\nto be of different shapes and sizes\u201d (1925, p. 158). The\nobjective constituent will in most of the situations seem\nelliptical rather than circular. This indicates, Broad\nclaims, that in each perceptual situation, the constituent\u2014the\nsensuously manifested item\u2014cannot be the top of the penny. What\nhappens is that instead of being immediately aware of the circular\nsurface of the penny (as he takes himself to be) he is immediately\naware of an elliptical item, an elliptical sensum. Hence it is an\nelliptical sensum rather than the circular surface of the penny that\nis manifested to the subject. The same holds mutatis mutandis\nwhen we perceive a white sheet of paper dimly lit by a candle. On\ncareful consideration it seems clear that the paper looks yellowish to\nus. So what we are immediately aware of is a yellowish sensum rather\nthan the white sheet of paper we are looking at.\n\nIn order to bring out at least some of the facets of Broad\u2019s\ntheory it seems advisable to turn to a few of the many objections that\nhave been raised against it.\n\n(1) It has sometimes been objected that the argument from illusion is\nflawed from the start since there is usually no risk of anyone being\ntaken in by the situation. Broad\u2019s response to this objection is\nclear. When we look at the penny from an oblique angle it appears\nelliptical, but not in the sense that anyone is taking in by\nthe situation, and mistakenly comes to believe or judge that the penny\nis elliptical. He is explicit on the point: \u201c\u2018looking\nelliptical to me\u2019 stands for a peculiar experience, which,\nwhatever the right analysis of it may be, is not just a mistaken\njudgement about the shape\u201d (1923, p. 237). The penny\nsensibly appears elliptical. And it is this rather than any\nsupposed tendency to be deceived which creates problem for Na\u00efve\nRealism (pace Austin 1962, p. 26).\n\n(2) It has often been objected that philosophers who have made use of\nthe argument from illusion that they neglect the fact of\nperceptual constancy. In his later works Broad admits that\nthis complaint is justified. However, the \u201crecognition of the\nphenomenon of constancy merely shifts the point of application of the\nargument\u201d (1947b, p. 112). There is a class of perceptual\nexperiences of a material object, X, where constancy holds;\nthere is also a class of experiences of X where constancy\nbreaks down. In theory it is logically possible to hold that the\nfacing surface of X is sensuously presented in the perceptual\nexperiences belonging to the first class but not in the experiences\nbelonging to the second class. \u201cBut, in view of the continuity\nbetween the most normal and the most abnormal cases of seeing, such a\ndoctrine would be utterly implausible and could be defended only by\nthe most desperate special pleading\u201d (1952a, p. 9).\n\nWhat I just said might create the impression that Broad\u2019s\nphenomenology is rather unsophisticated or crude. On the whole that is\ncertainly not the case. For example, he points out that \u201cthe\nvisual field\u201d is three-dimensional: \u201cA sphere does\nlook different from a circle, just as a circle looks\ndifferent from an ellipse\u201d (1923, p. 290; Broad\u2019s\nemphasis). And the same holds, mutatis mutandis, for the\nintimately related characteristics distance and depth; these are also\npurely visual characteristics of the visual field (pp.\n 295\u2013300).[5]\n\n(The constancy objection to any argument of illusion that appeals to\ncases such as the penny seen obliquely is a compelling one, to say the\nleast. In spite of that I will, for convenience of exposition,\noccasionally make use of the example below.)\n\n(3) A stock objection to sense-data theories has been that they invite\nscepticism with regard to the external world. Broad regrets the\nsceptical consequences but\u2014given the strength of the case for\nthe sense-datum theory\u2014does not consider them sufficient grounds\nfor dismissal. Seeking to preserve as much as possible of the common\nsense notion of material objects he argues for the existence of such\nobjects conceived of as having \u201cprimary qualities\u201d such as\nshape, size, and position (apart from such properties as electric\ncharge and mass). (1925, pp. 195\u2013204.) Not surprisingly, he\nrejects the idea that material objects have \u201csecondary\nproperties\u201d such as (phenomenal) redness or (phenomenal)\nhotness. Broad is perfectly clear that it does not follow\nfrom the fact that such properties are never sensuously manifested in\nour perceptual experiences that the material objects causing our\nexperiences lack these properties: it does remain possible that there\nare red and green, hot and cold material objects even though they are\nnot objects of acquaintance. He argues, however, that there is no\nreason to believe that material objects have these properties. (1925,\npp. 205\u20136.)\n2.4 Rivalling Accounts of Perceptual Sensations\n\nNow Broad is perfectly clear that the sensum analysis of perception\ncannot be established simply by pointing to such phenomena as the\npenny seen obliquely. He does not for a moment suppose that it is\npossible to logically infer that there is an elliptical sensum from\nthe proposition that something sensibly appears elliptical\n(pace Barnes 1945, p. 113). What he claims is that there are\nconsiderations that can be adduced in support of the sensum analysis.\nWhen we look at the penny from the side we certainly seem to\nbe aware of something elliptical. So we certainly seem to have before\nour minds something that is elliptical. Obviously \u201cwe can quite\nwell mistakenly believe a property to be present which is\nreally absent, when we are dealing with something that is only known\nto us indirectly, like Julius C\u00e6sar or the North Pole\u201d\n(1923, p. 241; Broad\u2019s emphasis). But there are phenomenological\ndifferences between perception and belief (or thought) that seem to\ncall for different accounts of their nature. In perception we seem to\nbe dealing with properties that are presented to us. Consider the case\nof perceiving a stick half immersed in water. Here\n\nwe are dealing with a concrete visible object, which is bodily present\nto our senses; and it is very hard to understand how we could seem to\nourselves to see the property of bentness exhibited in a\nconcrete instance, if in fact nothing was present to our\nminds that possessed that property. (1923, p. 241; Broad\u2019s\nemphasis; see also pp. 244\u20135)\n\n\nI believe that what Broad is driving at here is that perceptual\nconsciousness has a presentational nature, and it is this\nthat makes it plausible to regard it as involving the literal presence\nof objects with various qualities, such as colours in the case of\nvisual perception, sounds in auditory, etc.\n\nBroad\u2019s theory of perception employs an act-object analysis of\nsensations. Lest it should be thought that he should be incapable to\nthink of any alternative account it should be noted that he examines\nsuch an analysis as early as in 1921. G. F. Stout and H. A. Prichard\ndefended such an alternative (both of whom Broad held in the highest\nregard). Their account could be considered an early version of the\nadverbial analysis of sensations. Broad asks us to consider a\nheadache. \u201cIt is by no means clear that a headache means a state\nof mind with a headachy object [i.e. an act with a certain object]; it\nseems on the whole more plausible to say that that it is just a\nheadachy state of mind\u201d (1921b, p. 392). To have a headache is\nnot to be aware of a headachy object but to feel in a certain\n way.[6]\n The alternative account claims that this holds mutatis\nmutandis for any type of sensation. Thus what is\ndescribed as \u2018a sensation of red\u2019 is a unitary state of\nmind, and strictly speaking not a state which decomposes into an act\nof sensing and a sensed red patch.\n\nBroad provides a fairly thorough discussion of the relative merits of\nthe adverbial and the act-object analysis. In a nutshell, his\nconclusion is that although the adverbial analysis is highly plausible\nregarding such mental phenomena as bodily feelings; but it is\nimplausible when it comes to those of visual and auditory experiences:\nthe act-object analysis is the more plausible account of such\nexperiences, in Broad\u2019s opinion. (See Broad 1923, pp.\n 252\u20137.)[7]\n\nSo much for sensations. What about sensa? What are they on\nBroad\u2019s account? A brief answer must suffice here. Sensa are a\ncertain kind of transitory particulars, which in the case of visual\nperception have such properties as shape, size, colour, etc (1925, p.\n 181f.).[8]\n2.5 The Theory of Representative Perception\n\nThe position Broad reaches is the following. A perceptual experience\nhas a certain intentional content. It differs from thought- and\nbelief-episodes by including a sensory phase, and it is primarily this\nthat is responsible for the distinctive phenomenology of perception.\nThe sensory phase consists of sensations. These decompose into acts of\nsensing and object sensed, sensa. A sensum has the phenomenal\nproperties that the perceived object (sensibly) appears to\nhave\u2014red or warm or squeaky. An act of sensing a sensum\nconstitutes an immediate acquainting awareness of the sensum in\nquestion. Although our perceptual experiences seem to grant\nus an acquaintance with the facing surfaces of material objects, sensa\nare the only items we are acquainted with.\n\nThe intentional content\u2014the external reference\u2014of a\nperceptual experience is in a certain sense based upon sensa\n(thought not in the sense that there is a train of swift\ninference leading from the presence of a sensum to the mind to a\ncertain perceptual belief). (1923, pp. 246\u20137.) It is this\ncontent which represents the environment as featuring a physical\nobject so-and-so. Sensa are clearly incapable of carrying such\ncontent. Furthermore, from the very nature of the case the general\nnotion of physical object \u201ccannot have been derived by\nabstraction from observed instances of it, as the notion of\n\u2018red\u2019 no doubt has\n been.\u201d[9]\n In fact, general concept of a physical object \u201cis not\n\u2018got out of\u2019 experience until it has been \u2018put\ninto\u2019 experience. It is best described as an innate principle of\ninterpretation which we apply to the data of sense-perception\u201d\n(1925, p. 217).\n3. Time\n\nIt is possible to distinguish roughly three different phases in\nBroad\u2019s philosophy of time.\n\nIn his (1921a) Broad defends a Russellian theory of time. On this\nEternalist view past, present, and future are equally real.\nThere is nothing ontologically special about the present: the present\nis no more real than the past or the future. Accordingly Broad rejects\nPresentism\u2014the view that only the present is\nreal\u2014as \u201cmere rhetoric rooted in confusion\u201d (1921a,\np. 226). Presentism has its roots in two errors. One of these errors\nis to equivocate between two different senses of\n\u201cco-existence\u201d. \u201cIn one sense the parts of any\nrelated whole co-exist; in another only those events that occupy the\nsame moment of time co-exist.\u201d The whole course of the history\nobviously cannot co-exist in the latter sense, but this does not\n\u201cprevent it from co-existing in the first\u201d. The other\nerror is to believe that \u201cpast, present, and future are\nessential characteristics of objects in time in the same way as before\nand after are, instead of being analysable into the temporal relations\nof states of mind and their objects\u201d (p. 337). Thus Broad\nrejects the view that past, present, and future are characteristics\npossessed by objects in time. These \u201ccharacteristics\u201d are\na mere reflection of our subjective perspective on objects. Some of\nour mental states are essentially contemporary or\nsimultaneous with their objects, e.g. our immediate awareness\nof sense data. Other states are essentially later than their\nobjects, e.g. memories. (Cf. p. 336.) A related, and perhaps more\nimportant facet of Broad\u2019s (1921a) position here, is his\nadoption of a Russellian analysis of tensed discourse. According to\nthis analysis\u2014versions of which were later to become\northodox\u2014the function of tensed verbs or temporal adjectives in\ntensed statements is performed in the analysans by a tenseless copula,\nIS, and a temporal relation\u2014earlier than,\nsimultaneous with, or later than. Thus \u201cIt is\nraining\u201d (or \u201cIt is raining now\u201d) is unpacked as\n\u201cIt IS raining at a moment simultaneous with my assertion that\nit is raining\u201d; \u201cIt has rained\u201d (or \u201cIt rained\nin the past\u201d) is analysed as \u201cIt IS raining at a moment\nearlier than my assertion that it has rained\u201d; \u201cIt will\nrain\u201d (or \u201cIt will rain in the future\u201d) is read as\n\u201cIt IS raining at a moment later than my assertion that it will\nrain\u201d. (Cf. p. 331.)\n\nIn Scientific Thought (1923) Broad rejects the Eternalism he\nhad defended in his (1921a) article. He now advances a theory that\n\u201caccepts the reality of the present and the past, but holds that\nthe future is simply nothing at all\u201d (1923, p. 66). An\nall-important corollary of this Growing Block Theory is the\nthesis that temporal passage is a fundamental feature of\nreality. This feature is accounted for in terms of what Broad holds is\nthe most fundamental form of change, becoming. Becoming is\nthe coming into existence of events.\n\nNothing has happened to the present by becoming past except that fresh\nslices of existence have been added to the total history of the world.\nThe past is thus as real as the present. On the other hand, the\nessence of a present event is, not that it precedes future events, but\nthat there is quite literally nothing to which it has the\nrelation of precedence. The sum total of existence is always\nincreasing, and it is this which gives the time-series a sense [i.e.\ndirection] as well as an order. A moment t is later than a\nmoment t* if the sum total of existence at t\nincludes the sum total of existence t* together with\nsomething more. (1923, p. 66\u20137; Broad\u2019s italics.)\n\n\nAn event is present by virtue of being the most recent\nincrement of reality; when the event is present there is, as Broad\nsays, nothing to which it stands in the relation of precedence. The\nevent becomes past by virtue of acquiring new relations, and\nit acquires these relations because the sum total of existence has\nbeen increased by the addition of fresh slices of reality. Temporal\npassage is the continual growth of the sum total of\nexistence.[10]\n\nOne of the rivalling views on time Broad discusses is a theory that\nmight be labeled The Moving Spotlight Theory. The Moving\nSpotlight Theory accepts the eternalist view that the past, the\npresent, and the future are equally real; it regards \u201cthe\nhistory of the world as existing eternally in a certain order of\nevents.\u201d But it differs from the Russellian theory in that it\naccepts presentness as an irreducible feature of reality. So the fact\nthat the leaf is falling now is not to be analysed as the fact that\nthe event is simultaneous with an utterance or a specific type of\nmental state. The theory claims that presentness is a characteristic\nmoving along the order of events: \u201cAlong [the order of events],\nand in a fixed direction, [\u2026] the characteristic of presentness\n[is] moving, somewhat like the spot of light from a policeman\u2019s\nbull\u2019s-eye traversing the fronts of the houses in a street. What\nis illuminated is the present, what has been illuminated is the past,\nand what has not yet been illuminated is the future\u201d (1923, p.\n59).\n\nBroad is critical of this theory. To understand the nature of time,\nThe Moving Spotlight Theory makes use of a spatial analogy. Such\nanalogies \u201cmay be useful for some purposes, but it is clear that\nthey explain nothing.\u201d Firstly, Broad asks us to consider the\nsuccessive lighting of presentness\u2014now on one event and now on\nanother, and so on. This is itself an event (or a series of\nevents), \u201cand ought therefore to be a part of the series of\nevents, and not simply something that happens to the latter from\noutside\u201d (1923, p. 60). If we suppose (as we seem compelled to)\nthat it is not a part of the original series of events, we are\nlaunched on a vicious regress of time-dimensions. For then the\nsuccessive lightning of later events would have to be conceived of as\nan event of the second order\u2014happening in a\ntime-dimension different from the original one formed by the series of\nfirst-order events. Secondly he presents a related line of\nreasoning\u2014sometimes termed The Rate of Passage\nArgument: If anything moves, it must move with some determinate\nvelocity. It will always be sensible to ask \u2018How fast does it\nmove?\u2019 But since the series along which presentness is supposed\nto move is itself temporal, this question becomes: \u2018how great a\nlapse of time 1 does presentness traverse in a unit of time 2?\u2019\nAgain, a regress of time-dimensions is imminent. (Both of these\narguments receive a clearer formulation and more extensive treatment\nin Broad\n (1938).)[11]\n\nBroad\u2019s later account of time differs in some significant\nrespects from both of the earlier accounts. He now views what he calls\nabsolute becoming as \u201cthe rock-bottom peculiarity of\ntime\u201d. Absolute becoming manifests itself \u201cas the\ncontinual supersession of what was the latest phase by a new\nphase, which will in turn be superseded by another new one. This seems\nto me to be the rock-bottom peculiarity of time, distinguishing\ntemporal sequence from all other instances of one-dimensional\norder, such as that of points on a line, numbers in order of\nmagnitude, and so on\u201d (1959, p. 766).\n\nThis theory has, in Broad\u2019s opinion, various advantages. One\nadvantage mentioned is that it seems to avoid the difficulties with\nthe rate of times passage\u2014difficulties which besets the\nMoving Spotlight Theory, but arguably also the Growing Block Theory.\nThe proposed theory also avoids presupposing that \u201cwhat has not\nyet supervened and what has already been superseded in some sense\n\u2018co-exist\u2019 with each other and with what is now\noccurring,\u201d which he views as a defect of the Moving Spotlight\nTheory. More interestingly, it avoids what Broad now regards as a\ndefect of the Growing Block Theory, viz. that of presupposing\n\u201cthat phases, which have already supervened and been superseded,\nin some sense \u2018co-exist\u2019 with each other and with that\nwhich is now happening\u201d (1959, p. 767).\n\n(For a book-length study on Broad's philosophy of time, see Oaklander\n2020.)\n4. Free Will\n\nBroad discusses the topic of free will in his inaugural lecture\n\u201cDeterminism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism\u201d (1934).\nIn this rather dense lecture he approaches the issue by associating\nfree will with moral responsibility. More specifically, he frames it\nin terms of the conditions necessary and sufficient for the\napplicability of \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018ought not\u2019 to\nactions. Everyone admits, he says, that there is some sense of\n\u2018could\u2019 in which \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018ought\nnot\u2019 entail \u2018could\u2019. The question revolves around\nthe sense of \u2018could\u2019 involved here: in precisely what\nsense of \u2018could\u2019 is it that if you to ought to perform an\naction you could perform that action?\n\nLet us introduce a couple of Broad\u2019s stipulative definitions. An\naction is obligable if and only if it is an action of which\n\u2018ought to be done\u2019 or \u2018ought not to be done\u2019\ncan be predicated. An action is substitutable if either it\nwas done but could have been left undone, or was left undone but could\nhave been done.\n\nAn action is obligable if and only if it is, in a certain\nsense, substitutable. There are several different senses of\n\u2018could\u2019 and hence of substitutability. Initially Broad\nfocuses on a sense of \u2018could\u2019 which he calls voluntary\nsubstitutability. Consider an action A that was not\nperformed. Suppose that if the agent had willed (chosen,\ndecided) to do A she would have done it. In that case\nA is voluntarily substitutable. Suppose, however, that she\nwould not have done A even if she had willed to do it. If\nthat\u2019s the case, A is not voluntarily substitutable.\nBroad takes it as evident that voluntary substitutability is a\nnecessary condition for obligability. That is, he takes it as evident\nthat,\n\nA is obligable only if A is voluntarily\nsubstitutable.\n\n\nBut is it also a sufficient condition? Is it also true\nthat,\n\nIf A is voluntarily substitutable then A is\nobligable.\n\n\nBroad presents an argument in favour of a negative answer, i.e. in\nfavour of the answer that it could very well be true that someone\nwould have done an action if he had willed to do it, while it is\nnonetheless false that the action is obligable (and hence false that\nit is voluntarily substitutable). We are asked to consider a person\nwho gradually becomes addicted to a drug like morphine. At the earlier\nstages he could have willed with sufficient strength to ensure that\nthe temptation would have been resisted. At the later stages he could\nnot. \u201cNow at every stage, from the earliest to the latest, the\nhypothetical proposition would be true: \u2018If he had willed with a\ncertain degree of force and persistence to avoid taking morphine, he\nwould have avoided taking it\u2019. Yet we would say at the earlier\nstages that he ought to have resisted, whilst at the final stages we\nshould be inclined to say that \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018ought\nnot\u2019 have ceased to apply\u201d (1934, p. 200). In other words,\nin the later stages we are inclined to hold that the action of\nabstaining from morphine has ceased to be obligable, in spite of the\nfact that it remains true that if he had willed with\nsufficient force and persistence to abstain he would have\nabstained.\n\nThis is Broad\u2019s version of an argument sometimes raised against\nthe classical compatibilist conditional analysis of \u2018S\ncould have done\n otherwise\u2019.[12]\n According to the classical compatibilist analysis this is to be\nunderstood simply as \u2018if S had willed to act\ndifferently S would have acted differently\u2019. The\nargument shows that this will not do: there are situations where an\nagent would have acted otherwise if she had willed\ndifferently but nonetheless could not have acted differently simply\nbecause she could not have willed to act\n differently.[13]\n\nSo voluntary substitutability is not sufficient for obligability: for\nan action to be obligable it is not sufficient that the agent would\nhave acted otherwise if she had willed otherwise. It is also clear\nthat a further condition must be fulfilled, viz. that she could\nhave willed to act otherwise. This leads us to the question as to\nthe correct analysis of \u2018could have willed differently\u2019.\nBroad examines a conditional analysis according to which this\nmeans:\n\nIf S had willed differently in the past S\u2019s\nconative-emotional dispositions and knowledge about S\u2019s\nown nature would have been so constituted that S, at the time\nwhen S acted, would have willed differently.\n\n\nCan we perhaps claim an action to be obligable if (a) it is\nvoluntarily substitutable, and (b) the agent could have willed to do\nit, in the specified conditional sense of \u2018could have\nwilled\u2019? In other words, is the joint condition of (a) and (b)\nsufficient for obligability? Broad rejects this proposal. Suppose the\nagent could not have willed differently in the past (say six\nmonths ago). It is \u201csurely irrelevant to say that, if\nhe had done so his conative dispositions would have been\ndifferent at a later stage from what they in fact were then, and that\nhe would have willed otherwise than he then did\u201d (1934,\np. 204). As he points out, at this juncture it is tempting to refer to\nstill earlier volitions (say twelve months ago). He contends, however,\nthat this is useless since the very same difficulty will reappear.\n\nBroad holds, then, that neither \u2018could have acted\ndifferently\u2019 nor \u2018could have willed\ndifferently\u2019 can be given a conditional analysis. Having\ndiscarded conditional types of substitutability he turns to\ncategorical substitutability. If an action is obligable it\nmust be substitutable in a categorical sense. \u201cWe must be able\nto say of an action, which was done, that it could have been avoided,\nin some sense of \u2018could\u2019 which is not definable in terms\nof \u2018would have, if\u2019\u201d (1934, p. 204). Note that the\nquoted passage merely states that categorical substitutability is a\nnecessary condition of obligability. It is clear, however,\nthat Broad also takes it to be a sufficient condition. Thus, his\nposition is that,\n\nA is obligable if and only if A is categorically\nsubstitutable.\n\n\nNow precisely what is categorical substitutability? As we\nshall presently see, Broad claims that this notion is only partly\nintelligible.\n\nCategorical substitutability involves a negative and a positive\ncondition. These are necessary and jointly sufficient for\nobligability. The negative condition says that the\nagent\u2019s willing of a certain action was not completely\ndetermined by the nomic and singular conditions which existed at the\ntime of willing. Not surprisingly, Broad regards an action that merely\nfulfils this condition as \u201can accident, lucky or\nunlucky as the case may be.\u201d Neither the agent nor\n\u201canything else in the universe can properly be praised or blamed\nfor it\u201d (1934, p. 212; Broad\u2019s italics).\n\nThe positive condition (which must also be fulfilled) says\nthat the willing of the action is \u201cliterally determined by the\nagent or self, considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a\ntotal cause which contains as factors events in and\ndispositions of the agent\u201d (1934, p. 214\u20135;\nBroad\u2019s italics). Thus a free action is an action that is caused\nby the agent.\n\n(Note that the view that there are agent-caused effects is a form of\nindeterminism, since it says that there are certain events\nwhich, although they are indeed caused, are not fixed as a matter of\nnatural law.)\n\nBroad rejects the idea of agent-causation as unintelligible.\n\nNow it is surely quite evident that, if the beginning of a certain\nprocess at a certain time is determined at all, its total cause\nmust contain as an essential factor another event or process\nwhich enters into the moment from which the determined event\nor process issues. I see no prima facie objection to there\nbeing events which are not completely determined. But, in so far as an\nevent is determined, an essential factor in its total cause\nmust be other events. How could an event possibly be\ndetermined to happen at a certain date if its total cause contained no\nfactor to which the notion of date has any application? And how can\nthe notion of date have any application to anything that is not an\nevent? (1934, p. 215; Broad\u2019s emphasis.)\n\n\nIf an agent wills to perform an action at a certain time there must be\na process or event that occurs at that time (or the moment before).\nThus there must be something about the agent that explains why the\nwilling of the action started precisely at that time rather than at a\nslightly earlier or later time. The agent per se will not\ndo.\n\nThe position Broad reaches is a version of what is sometimes called\nfree will pessimism: free will is incompatible with\ndeterminism, but there is no viable form of indeterminism\nwhich leaves room for free will, either; therefore, free will does not\nexist\u2014indeed could not exist.\n5. Emergentism\n\nIn the last chapter of his monumental The Mind and Its Place in\nNature Broad defends an Emergentist position with respect to the\nrelation between mind and matter: mental properties are, in his\nopinion, distinct from physical properties; they are properties that\nemerge when neurophysiological processes have attained a\nsufficiently high degree of complexity. His discussion and defense of\nEmergentism features two chief elements. Firstly, there is a\nmeticulous examination of the concept of emergence as such; secondly,\nthere is a discussion of whether there is reason to think that\nemergent phenomena actually exist.\n5.1 The Concept of Emergence\n\nChapter Two of The Mind and its Place in Nature is devoted to\na thorough discussion of the notion of emergence. In this\nchapter Broad is primarily interested in the notion or concept of\nemergence per se. Thus he is there not so much interested in\nthe actual existence of emergent phenomena.\n\nAn emergent property of an aggregate or a whole is, very\nroughly, a property that is something over and above the properties of\nits parts and the way they are arranged in the aggregate. Broad\nprefers to capture this in epistemic terms: an emergent property of a\nwhole is a property that it is impossible to logically infer from even\nthe most complete knowledge of the properties of the parts of the\nwhole. A property that can be so inferred is a\nreducible property. He captures the contrast between emergent\nand reducible properties in the following passage.\n\nPut in abstract terms the emergent theory asserts that there\nare certain wholes composed (say) of constituents A,\nB, and C in a relation R to each other;\nthat all wholes composed of constituents of the same kind as\nA, B, and C in relations of the same kind\nas R have certain characteristic properties; that A,\nB, and C are capable of occurring in other kinds of\ncomplex where the relation is not of the same kind as R; and\nthat the characteristic properties of the whole R(A,\nB, C) cannot, even in theory, be deduced from the\nmost complete knowledge of the properties of A, B,\nand C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the\nform R(A, B, C). The\nmechanistic theory rejects the last clause of this assertion.\n(1925, p. 61)\n\n\n\u2018The mechanistic theory\u2019 is Broad\u2019s label for the\ntheory that today is termed \u2018physicalism.\u2019\n\nSuppose a certain biological feature, e.g. the capacity for nutrition,\nis an emergent property. This means that the property is not a mere\nresult of an immensely high degree of organisational complexity at the\nchemical level. The property is, to be sure, nomically dependent on\nthe chemical level, but it is not a mere resultant of the properties,\nrelations, and laws operative at that level. If nutrition were a mere\nresultant property it would be a reducible property; it would\nbe a property that theoretically can be inferred from\nfeatures at the chemical level (i.e. the properties, relations and\nlaws which characterise the constituents in isolation or in other\nwholes than the one in question).\n\nBroad\u2019s concept of emergence is weakly epistemic; his\nnotion is at heart metaphysical: the epistemic predicament that we are\nin vis-\u00e0-vis an emergent property reflects an important\nmetaphysical fact about the property in question, viz. that it is\nneither identical with nor constituted by the properties and relations\nof the constituents of the whole in question. Thus Broad\u2019s\nnotion of emergence contrasts with a strongly epistemic\nnotion which, very roughly, says that a property is emergent for a\nfinite epistemic subject when provided with fairly extensive\ninformation about the properties and relations of the constituents the\nsubject is still unable logically to infer that property from the\ninformation in question although the property in fact is\nreducible to the features of the constituents.\n\nHempel and Oppenheim (1948) raise several objections to Emergentism.\nBrief attention to two of their objections will help bring out at\nleast a couple of the many facets of Broad\u2019s subtle account.\nFirstly, to assume that emergent phenomena exist is to assume that\nthere are certain phenomena that have \u201ca mysterious quality of\nabsolute unexplainability\u201d. They confidently assert that\n\u201cemergence [\u2026] is not an ontological trait inherent in\nsome phenomena; rather it is indicative of the scope of our knowledge\nat a given time\u201d (p. 119). This objection in effect implies that\nthe metaphysical notion of emergence is dismissed in favour of a\nstrongly epistemic notion.\n\nBroad stresses that it is an empirical question whether a certain\nbiological or chemical phenomenon is emergent or not. It is always\npossible that what strikes us as an emergent property of a biological\nof chemical phenomenon \u201cis due to our imperfect knowledge of\nmicroscopic structure or to our mathematical incompetence\u201d\n(1925, p. 81). He also emphasises the practical importance of seeking\nto devise reductions for as many properties as possible: that ambition\nis \u201cthe natural and proper ambition of the scientists\u201d\n(1933, p. 268).\n\nIt should perhaps also be added that although emergent properties are\nindeed \u201cunexplainable\u201d in the sense that that they are not\nsusceptible to a reductive explanation, this does not mean\nthat they are \u201cunexplainable\u201d in every sense: the\ninherence of an emergent property in a particular whole does admit of\nan explanation by nomic subsumption. We can explain its\ninherence in terms of the nature of the whole and an emergent law. The\nlaw of course remain a brute fact. But surely, so do some laws on\nany account of the world.\n\nHempel and Oppenheim also object that Emergentists are erroneously\ncommitted to regard the mass or weight of a whole as an emergent\nproperty. (Weight is, of course, a reducible characteristic if there\never was one!) The reason they give for this is that not even the\nweight of a whole can be logically inferred from premises that solely\ncontain propositions about the weight of the parts; in addition a law\nis needed which expresses the weight of the whole as some specific\nmathematical function of the weight of the constituent (1948, p. 119).\nHowever, Broad\u2019s account clearly anticipates the objection. He\nprovides the reason why a property such as weight (or mass) should not\nbe conceived as an emergent property. To \u201cexplain the behaviour\nof any whole in terms of its structure and components we\nalways need two independent kinds of information. (a) We need\nto know how the parts would behave separately. And (b) we need to know\nthe law or laws according to which the behaviour of the separate parts\nis compounded when they are acting together in any proportion and\narrangement\u201d (1925, p. 61; Broad\u2019s italics). So to know\nabout the mass of a whole X we need to know the mass of\nX\u2019s parts and the principle according to which\nthe mass of a whole is determined by the mass of the parts. It is\nthrough experience that we have found that the mass of a whole is the\nmathematical sum of the mass of the parts; and it is through\nexperience we have found that the very same principle (or law of\ncomposition) is applicable to any type of whole. To see this,\nconsider the last clause of Broad\u2019s characterisation of emergent\nproperties above. The clause says that an emergent property of a\ncertain whole cannot, even in theory, be logically inferred from the\nmost complete knowledge of the properties of the parts in\nisolation or in other wholes which are not of the form to be\nfound the whole in question. Is this applicable to the mass of a\ncertain whole? Is it applicable to the mass of X? No,\ncertainly not: we are able to logically infer the mass of any\nwhole, including X, from knowledge of the masses of parts in\nisolation or in wholes other than X.\n5.2 The Reality of Emergence\n\nIt is one thing to delineate the contours of the notion of emergence,\nanother to argue that emergent phenomena actually exist. A wide\nvariety of phenomena have been held to be emergent. Apart from\nconsciousness, various chemical and biological phenomena have been\nheld to be emergent. Broad is not willing to rule out a physicalistic\nreduction of chemistry and biology to physics: chemical and biological\nphenomena might, he believes, very well be reducible to complex\nmicrophysical processes. In his opinion, however, consciousness is a\ndifferent matter. We will turn to consciousness in a moment. When it\ncomes to biology and chemistry he declares that he does not see any\n\u201ca priori impossibility in a mechanistic biology or\nchemistry\u201d (1925, p. 72). He stresses that it is in practice\nenormously difficult to know whether, say, a certain biological\nfeature such as nutrition is emergent or not. It is evident from what\nBroad says that he recognises that the Emergentist stance has its\ndangers in that it tends to encourage acceptance of laws and\nproperties as ultimate and irreducible. There is a danger in this\nbecause, as he notes, reductive explanations have proved remarkably\nsuccessful in the past, and there is the possibility that what we take\nto be an emergent phenomenon is in fact reducible.\n5.3 Broad\u2019s Knowledge Argument\n\nIn the last chapter of his book Broad presents a taxonomy of no less\nthan seventeen different theories which are \u201cpossible\ntheoretically on the relation between Mind and Matter\u201d (1925, p.\n607). By a process of elimination Broad arrives at a more wieldy\nnumber of theories. Two of the remaining rivalling theories are\nPhysicalism\u2014in Broad\u2019s terminology,\n\u201cMechanism\u201d\u2014and Emergentism. Let us now take a\ncloser look at his case for Emergentism.\n\nBroad adduces a version of what has come to be known as The\nKnowledge Argument in favour of an Emergentist position with\nrespect to the place of consciousness in nature. He asks us to assume\nthat there is a mathematical archangel. The archangel\u2019s\nmathematical and logical capability is unlimited; in addition he is\ngifted with the capacity to perceive \u201cthe microscopic structure\nof atoms as easily as we can perceive hay-stacks\u201d. Now would\nthere be any limit to the archangel\u2019s knowledge of the world?\nBroad\u2019s answer is Yes.\n\nTake any ordinary statement, such as we find in chemistry books; e.g,\n\u201cNitrogen and Hydrogen combine when an electric discharge is\npassed through the mixture of the two. The resulting compound contains\nthree atoms of Hydrogen to one of Nitrogen; it is a gas readily\nsoluble in water and possessed of a characteristic smell.\u201d If\nthe mechanistic theory be true the archangel could deduce from his\nknowledge of the microscopic structure of atoms all these fact but the\nlast. He would know exactly what the microscopic structure must be;\nbut he would be totally unable to predict that a substance with this\nstructure must smell as ammonia does when it gets into the human nose.\nThe utmost that he could predict on this subject would be that certain\nchanges would take place in the mucous membrane, the olfactory nerves\nand so on. But he could not possibly know that these changes would be\naccompanied by the appearance of a smell in general or of the peculiar\nsmell of ammonia in particular, unless someone told him so or he had\nsmelled it for himself. If the existence of the so-called\n\u201csecondary qualities,\u201d or the fact of their appearance,\ndepends on the microscopic movements and arrangements of material\nparticles which do not have these qualities themselves, then the law\nof this dependence are certainly of the emergent type. [1925, p.\n71\u20132]\n\n\nThe archangel knows all the physicalistic (mechanistic) truths. There\nare, however, some truths that he does not know. But if Physicalism\nwere true the archangel should know all truths. Physicalism\nis, therefore, false.\n\nIf sound, Broad\u2019s argument establishes the negative conclusion\nthat mental phenomena are distinct from neurophysiological processes.\nBy itself it does not establish the Emergentist position, since the\nconclusion is consistent with the truth of, say, Substance Dualism (or\nwhat Broad calls \u201cDualism of incompatibles\u201d).\nBroad\u2019s overall argumentation for Emergentism, however, also\nincludes a fairly thorough discussion that seeks to undermine various\nlines of argument to the effect that mental properties and physical\nproperties are incompatible, i.e. arguments to the effect\nthat a material whole such as a nervous system could not possibly have\nmental properties. These are arguments that, if successful, would rule\nout Emergentism (which is a form of property dualism) in favour of\nsubstance dualism. Broad\u2019s case for Emergentism, then, includes\nmore than his knowledge argument and the simple methodological point\nthat Emergentism is a more ontologically economical position than\nsubstance dualism.\n6. Metaphilosophy\n\nBroad distinguishes two chief aspects of philosophical thinking. He\nlabels these critical philosophy and speculative philosophy.\nCritical philosophy has two chief tasks, one of which is to\nanalyse \u201ccertain very general concepts such as number, thing,\nquality, change, cause, etc.\u201d (1924, p. 82). We make use of\nthese and a whole host of other concepts in science and ordinary life.\nAlthough we are typically able to apply them fairly consistently, we\nare not able to analyse them. Nor are we able to state their precise\nrelations to each other. One task of critical philosophy is to provide\nanalyses of such concepts. It becomes evident that this is an\nimportant task as soon as it is realized that when we seek to apply\nthese concepts to odd or exceptional cases we are often uncertain\nwhether they are applicable. For example, it might be unclear whether\na certain individual with a multiple personality disorder is a\nperson or\n not.[14]\n Such difficulties arise because \u201cwe are not clear as to what we\nmean by \u2018being a person\u2019\u201d (1924, p. 83). There is,\ntherefore, a need for an intellectual discipline that seeks to analyse\nand define this and many other concepts.\n\nIn science and in daily life we do not merely use unanalysed concepts.\n\u201cWe also assume uncritically a number of very fundamental\npropositions. In all our arguments we assume the truth of certain\nprinciples of reasoning. Again, we always assume that every change has\na cause. And in induction we certainly assume something\u2014it is\nhard to say what\u2014about the fundamental \u2018make-up\u2019 of\nthe existent world\u201d (1924, p. 84).\n\nThe second task of critical philosophy is to examine these and other\nfundamental assumptions; it is \u201cto take these propositions which\nwe uncritically assume in science and daily life and to subject them\nto criticism\u201d\n (ibid.).[15]\n\nIn order to analyse a proposition we must seek to attain a clearer\ngrasp of the concepts featured in the proposition. Thus the analysis\nand criticism of a proposition depends on the analysis of concepts.\nAnd vice versa: by reflecting on the propositions in which a\ncertain concept occurs we clear up the meaning of it.\n\nNow, critical philosophy is one part or aspect of philosophical\nthinking. But critical philosophy \u201cdoes not include all that is\nunderstood by philosophy. It is certainly held to be the function of a\nphilosopher to discuss the nature of Reality as a whole, and to\nconsider the position and prospects of men in it\u201d (1924, p. 96).\nThis aspect of philosophical thinking is speculative\nphilosophy.\n\nSpeculative philosophy seeks to work out a view of reality as a whole\nby taking into account the whole range of human\nexperience\u2014scientific, social, ethical, \u00e6sthetic, and\nreligious: \u201cIts business is to take over all aspects of human\nexperience, to reflect upon them, and to try to think out a view of\nReality as a whole which shall do justice to all of them\u201d (1924,\np. 96).\n\nBroad\u2019s idea is that the various aspects of human experience and\n(putative) facts linked to these provide a point of departure for\nphilosophical reflection\u2014an exceedingly important sort of\nreflection aiming at a reasoned view of Reality as a whole.\n\nAs can be gathered from the above, philosophical thinking features,\naccording to Broad, a distinctive type of birds-eye view. He calls it\nsynopsis. Let us take a somewhat closer look at this. The\nplain man as well as the professional scientist or scholar\n\nconduct various parts of their living and their thinking in relatively\nwatertight compartments; turn blind eyes to awkward, abnormal, or\nmarginal facts; and skate successfully on the surface of the\nphenomena. But the desire to see how the various aspects of experience\nhang together does arise from time to time in most intelligent men,\nand philosophers are persons in whom it is especially strong and\npersistent. Now I understand by synopsis the necessary\npreliminary towards trying to satisfy this desire, viz. the deliberate\nviewing together of aspects of human experience which are generally\nviewed apart, and the endeavour to see how they are inter-related.\n(1947a, p. 4)\n\n\nOn reflection it is clear that the synoptic stance is necessary for\nthe discovery of various inadequacies in our picture of reality,\ninadequacies resulting from a far too insular perspective on reality.\nThe synoptic stance will, in effect, lead to the discovery of latent\nphilosophical problems: \u201cIt is synopsis, revealing prima\nfacie incoherence, which is the main motive to philosophical\nactivity\u201d (1958, p. 121; cf. 1947a, p. 16). And it is clearly\nonly after we have discovered and successfully addressed these\nproblems that we may lay claim to a satisfactory picture of reality as\na whole.\n\nBroad gives several examples of how synopsis is featured in\nphilosophical thinking. One of these is taken from the free will\nproblem (1947a, pp. 8\u201311). In a very condensed form the main\nfacts germane to the problem are these: (i) When we consider a\nsituation in which we did a certain action, we are quite convinced\nthat we could have done otherwise: we could have performed an\nalternative action. On reflection it seems clear that\n\u2018could\u2019 is used in some sense that is not analysable in\nterms of \u2018would have, if\u2019. (ii) Our moral judgments seem\nto presuppose that a person who in fact willed to do a certain action\ncould have willed otherwise. (iii) Given the past, the actual\nsituation and the laws of nature it seems impossible that anything\nother should have happened than what in fact did happen. If so, how\ncan our volitions be other than completely determined? (iv) It is\ndifficult, then, to reconcile the notions of moral responsibility with\nthe view that our volitions are completely determined.\n\nThe problem of free will is discovered when we look at (i) and (ii) in\nthe light of (iii) In other words, the very problem is discerned only\nbecause we have envisaged these facts together, i.e. because we have\ntaken a synoptic view of the facts.\n7. Other Philosophical Work\n\nProbability and Induction. Broad dealt with problems\nregarding induction\u2014\u201cthe glory of science and the scandal\nof\n philosophy\u201d[16]\n \u2014in a number of papers. A sample of his work on the subject is\nthe two early papers entitled \u201cThe Relation Induction and\nProbability\u201d (1918, 1920). Broad\u2019s focus is on the nature\nand justification of inductive inferences. He argues that unless the\nconclusions of such inferences are cast in terms of probability they\nall involve a formal fallacy. However in order to arrive at justified\ninductive conclusions we cannot simply place our confidence in any of\nthe known principles of probability theory (such as those we employ in\nreasoning with regard to artificial situations with bags containing\nred and white balls, and the like): we need some further premise.\nUnfortunately, this premise is \u201cextremely difficult to state\n[\u2026] so that it shall be at once plausible and\nnon-tautologous\u201d (1918, p. 389). Broad attempts to articulate\nthe supreme principle needed. He argues at length that the principle\nneeded says not simply (and crudely): \u201cthere is uniformity in\nnature.\u201d It also says that the particular things or substances\nin the world subject to uniformity belong to a variety of natural\nkinds. Indeed, on closer reflection it is clear that \u201c[t]he\nnotions of permanent substances, genuine natural kinds, and universal\ncausation are parts of a highly complex and closely interwoven whole\nand any of them breaks down hopelessly without the rest\u201d (1920,\np. 44). Notable also is the logic of conditions that Broad\u2019s\nformulates in \u201cThe Principles of Demonstrative Induction\u201d\n(1930b). He may quite well be the first who gave systematic attention\nto this\n topic.[17]\n\nCausation. Causation is dealt with in several of\nBroad\u2019s works (beginning as early as his first book,\nPerception, Physics and Reality, 1914). The logic of\nconditions formulated in (1930b) would square well with some version\nof the regularity theory of causation. However, in several works\nrather penetrating criticism of that theory is offered (e.g., in Ch.\n3, 1925). In (1933) he tries to formulate an alternative. Causality\ninvolves something between regularity and logical entailment; there is\nsome form of necessity, but not the kind involved in logical\nentailment. The latter is an absolute necessity. Consider the\nproposition \u2019Anything that has shape would have\nextension\u2019. This is not only true in the actual world: it is\ntrue in all logically possible worlds; there could not have been a\nworld in which there were things that had shape but lacked extension.\nNow compare the proposition \u2019Anything that had inertial mass\nwould have gravitational mass\u2019. There could not be things in the\nactual world which had inertial mass but lacked gravitational\nmass. But there could have been a world in which there were things\nthat had inertial mass but lacked gravitational mass. The kind of\nnecessity involved here is a contingent necessity. (Cf. 1933, pp.\n242\u20133.) Broad is, however, rather skeptical of the alternative\nhe has sought to formulate. He says with characteristic candor that\nthe notion of a necessity which is contingent might very well be\n\u201csheer nonsense\u201d.\n\nThe Unconscious. Broad examines issues surrounding \u201cthe\nunconscious\u201d at some length in The Mind and Its Place in\nNature. His objective is to capture a (literal) sense in which an\nexperiential mental state may be said to be unconscious. Although he\nrejects the view that the notion of unconscious experience is\nincoherent he argues that there is no compelling reason to assume that\nsuch actually exist. The assumption that there is a pure neural state\nwith causal properties that are similar to those of a certain mental\nstate is sufficient to explain the facts.\n\nTime Consciousness. Broad gave two different accounts of\ntemporal\n experience.[18]\n Consider an experience of a succession of notes:\nDo\u2013Re\u2013Mi. The earlier account\nclaims that what one is aware of is temporally extended; it\nincludes the present note as well as the immediate past ones:\n\u201cwhat is sensed at any moment stretches a little way back behind\nthat moment\u201d (1923, p. 348). What you are aware of when\nMi is present extends to, and so includes the past notes\nRe and Do. On the later account we are strictly\nspeaking aware only of the present note, Mi. But this\nawareness is coupled with a representation of the past notes under a\ndistinctive mode of temporal presentation. Broad introduces the notion\nof presentedness. When you are aware of the present note\nMi it is apprehended as possessing the maximum degree of\npresentedness, while the note Re is represented as possessing\na less degree of presentedness, and Do a still lesser\ndegree.\n\nThe Philosophy of Parapsychology. Parapsychology is the study\nof apparently paranormal events. Broad seeks to capture the nature and\nimportance of the subject. A paranormal event is an event that seems\nprima facie to conflict with what he terms a basic\nlimiting principle, i.e. a principle that \u201cwe\nunhesitatingly take for granted as the framework within which all our\npractical activities and our scientific theories are confined\u201d\n(1953, p. 7). There are a number of such principles. One says that an\nevent cannot begin to have any effect before it has occurred; another\nthat knowledge of the future is impossible except in certain familiar\nmanners, such as by inference from present facts. The basic limiting\nprinciples seem to \u201ccover very satisfactorily an enormous range\nof well-established facts of the most varied kinds\u201d. We are\ntherefore \u201cnaturally inclined to think that they must be\nall-embracing\u201d (p. 8). And for that reason these principles are\nof immense importance to our overall view of the universe and our\nplace in it. But just in proportion to this importance is \u201cthe\nphilosophic importance of any well-established exception to\nthem\u201d (p. 9).\n\nThe Philosophy of Religion. Broad\u2019s writings on this\nsubject have the virtues characteristic of everything he\nwrote\u2014thoroughness, lucidity and fairness. Broad rejects the\ntraditional arguments for the existence of God. His essay\n\u201cArguments for The Existence of God\u201d (1939) features a\nsearching critique of the cosmological argument and the ontological\nargument (regarding the argument from design, Broad states that he has\nnothing to add to the critique of Hume and Kant). He argues inter\nalia that the conclusion of the cosmological argument has a\nconsequence that few would stomach, viz. that there are no really\ncontingent facts, although many facts \u201cseem contingent relative\nto our ignorance\u201d. As to the ontological argument Broad claims\nthat the notion of the greatest possible being is \u201cmeaningless\nverbiage\u201d unless the properties that are essential to the notion\nof God admit of an intrinsic maximum. He argues that that\ncondition is not satisfied. Therefore, the argument is \u201cwrecked\nbefore ever it leaves port.\u201d In the latter part of his essay\nBroad turns to the argument from religious experience (in what might\nquite well be the first systematic treatment of the argument). The\nposition he takes is, in a nutshell, this. If a person has an\nexperience that she takes to be an experience of an X, it is\nreasonable to conclude that she did experience an X unless\nthere is some positive reason to think otherwise. To refuse to apply\nthis principle to religious experiences is not reasonable. The\nquestion then is whether there is some positive reason to think that\nreligious experiences are delusive. But on reflection it turns out\nthere is no such reason. We may therefore conclude that religious\nexperiences are probably veridical.\n\nEthics. In writings up to, and including Five Types of\nEthical Theory Broad assumes that ethical sentences express\njudgements. He favours an intuitionist or non-naturalist analysis. In\nlater works, however, he is undecided: it could be that ethical\nsentences express judgements; but, alternatively, they may express\nemotions or commands. Notwithstanding this, Broad fruitfully (and\nindefatigably!) classifies alternative types of ethical theories,\nuncovers their underlying assumptions, and draws out their logical\nconsequences. As to normative ethics, Broad does not think the\nutilitarian view that there is one and only one criterion of right\naction can be sustained. Neither did he accept hedonism. There are, he\nargues, other bearers of intrinsic value and disvalue than pleasure\nand pain.\n\nBroad made many specific contributions to the subject of moral\nphilosophy that could be mentioned. Here are three of these. (i) There\nis a fine discussion of psychological egoism (a discussion where he,\nas he quite correctly says, gives the psychological egoist \u201cthe\nlongest possible run for his\n money\u201d).[19]\n After Butler there is hardly need of further nails in the coffin of\nthat theory. But because of its shrewd and perceptive treatment of\nhuman motivation Broad\u2019s essay is nonetheless of remaining\ninterest. (ii) In Five Types Broad tentatively suggests a\nversion of what is currently known as the The Fitting Attitude\nAnalysis of value. He writes with characteristic cautiousness:\n\u201cI am not sure that \u2018X is good\u2019 could not\nbe defined as meaning that X is such that it would be a\nfitting object of desire to any mind which had an adequate idea of its\nnon-ethical characteristics\u201d (p.\n 283).[20]\n (iii) In an early paper (1916), Broad seems to anticipate ideas\ngaining currency much later among moral and political philosophers. He\nsuggests that the goodness of a complex state of affairs is not merely\na function of the value of its parts. Its goodness is restrained by a\ncondition which says, roughly, that the best possible state of affairs\nis one where the producers of some good are as nearly as possible\nidentical with the enjoyers of that good. The principle says that the\ncontributors to a cooperative scheme is bound by a duty of\nfairness. The principle Broad alludes to could be seen as an\nearly version of the Principle of Fairness (later to be found in the\nwork of H. L. A. Hart and John\n Rawls).[21]\n\nThe History of Philosophy. Broad wrote on a variety of\nscattered figures in the history of philosophy, e.g. Bacon, Butler,\nBerkeley, Newton, Leibniz and Kant. A notable work is Five Types\nof Ethical Theory that (alongside careful discussions of such\nphilosophers as Spinoza and Hume) includes a pioneering study of Henry\nSidgwick\u2019s The Methods of Ethics (1874), written at a\ntime when Sidgwick\u2019s work had passed into nearly complete\noblivion. Noteworthy here also are the two posthumously published book\nlength studies on Leibniz and Kant, respectively. Both of these\ncontain shrewd philosophical comment that are of general philosophical\ninterest.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLitBroWor\">Primary Literature: Broad\u2019s Works</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLitBroWor\">Primary Literature: Broad\u2019s Works</a>": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cellpad-small vert-top cell-rl\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "[1914]", "<em>Perception, Physics, and Reality</em>, Russell and Russell,\nNew York, 1973; this edition is a reissue of the work, originally\npublished by Cambridge University Press in 1914. </tr>\n<tr>", "[1915]", "\u201cPhenomenalism,\u201d <em>Proceedings of the Aristotelian\nSociety</em>, 15: 227\u201351. </tr>\n<tr>", "[1916]", "\u201cOn the Function of False Hypotheses in Ethics,\u201d\n<em>International Journal of Ethics</em>, 26: 377\u201397; reprinted\nin Broad 1971, 43\u201362 and\n [<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/intejethi.26.3.2377052\" target=\"other\">available online</a>].\n</tr>\n<tr>", "[1918]", "\u201cThe Relation between Induction and Probability (I)\u201d\n<em>Mind</em>, 27: 389\u2013404.
