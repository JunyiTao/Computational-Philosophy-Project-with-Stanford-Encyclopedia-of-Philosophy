    "main_text": "Logic || How the different conceptions of logic are related to each other\n2.2 How the different conceptions of logic are related to each other\n\nHow (L1) and (L2) relate to each other is subject of controversy. One\nstraightforward, though controversial view, is the following. For any\ngiven system of representations, like sentences in a natural language,\nthere is one and only one set of logical constants. Thus there will be\none formal language that best models what logically valid inferences\nthere are among these natural representations. This formal language\nwill have a logical vocabulary that captures the inferential\nproperties of the logical constants, and that models all other\nrelevant features of the natural system of representation with\nnon-logical vocabulary. One especially important system of\nrepresentations are our natural languages. Thus (L1) is the study of\nformal languages of which one is distinguished, and this one\ndistinguished language nicely represents the fixed and non-fixed\nfeatures of our natural languages, through its logical and non-logical\nvocabulary, at least assuming that our natural languages are similar\nto each other in this regard. And validity in that formal language, a\ntechnical notion defined in the appropriate way for that formal\nlanguage, nicely models logical validity or logical consequence in our\nnatural language system of representations. Or so this view of the\nrelationship between (L1) and (L2) holds.\n\nThis view of the relationship between (L1) and (L2), however, assumes\nthat there is one and only one set of logical constants for each\nsystem of representations. A contrary view holds that which\nexpressions are treated as logical constants is a matter of choice,\nwith different choices serving different purposes. If we fix, say,\n\u2018believes\u2019 and \u2018knows\u2019 then we can see that\n\u2018\\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)\u2019 is implied by \u2018\\(x\\)\nknows that \\(p\\)\u2019 (given widely held views about knowledge and\nbelief). This does not mean that \u2018believes\u2019 is a logical\nconstant in an absolute sense. Given other interests, other\nexpressions can be treated as logical. According to this conception,\ndifferent formal languages will be useful in modeling the inferences\nthat are formally valid given different set of \u2018logical\nconstants\u2019 or expressions whose meaning is kept fixed.\n\nThis debate thus concerns whether there is one and only one set of\nlogical constants for a system of representations, and if so, which\nones are the logical ones. We will not get into this debate here, but\nthere is quite a large literature on what logical constants are, and\nhow logic can be demarcated. For a general discussion and further\nreferences, see for example Engel 1991. Some of the classic papers\nin this debate include Hacking 1979, who defends a proof-theoretic\nway of distinguishing logical constants from other expressions. The\nleading idea here is that logical constants are those whose meaning\ncan be given by proof-theoretic introduction and elimination rules. On\nthe other hand, Mauthner 1946, van Benthem 1986, van Benthem\n1989, and Tarski 1986 defend semantic ways to mark that difference.\nThe leading idea here is that logical notions are \u2018permutation\ninvariant\u2019. Since logic is supposed to be completely general and\nneutral with respect to what the representations are about, it should\nnot matter to logic if we switch around the objects that these\nrepresentations are about. So, logical notions are those that are\ninvariant under permutations of the domain. Van Benthem 1989 gives a\ngeneral formulation to this idea. See the entry on\n logical constants\n for more.\n\nThe relationship between (L2) and (L3) was briefly addressed above.\nThey seem to be closely related because a logical truth can be\nunderstood as one that follows from an empty set of premises, and A\nbeing a logical consequence of B can be understood as it being a\nlogical truth that if A then B. There are some questions to be ironed\nout about how this is supposed to go more precisely. How should we\nunderstand cases of logical consequence from infinitely many premises?\nAre logical truths all finitely statable? But for our purposes we can\nsay that they are rather closely related.\n\nThe relationship between (L2) and (L4) on the other hand raises some\nquestions. For one, of course, there is an issue about what it means\nto say that judgments have a form, and whether they do in the relevant\nsense. But one way in which this question could be understood directly\nties it to (L2). If thoughts, and thus judgments, are realized by\nminds having a certain relation to mental representations, and if\nthese representations are themselves structured like a language, with\na \u201csyntax\u201d and a \u201csemantics\u201d (properly\nunderstood), then the form of a judgment could be understood just like\nthe form of a sentence. Such a view of thoughts is commonly called the\nLanguage of Thought hypothesis, see Fodor 1975, and if it is\ncorrect then in the language of thought there might be logical and\nnon-logical vocabulary. The form of a judgment could be understood\nalong the lines we understood the form of a linguistic representation\nwhen we talked about formally valid inferences. Thus the relationship\nbetween (L2) and (L4) is rather direct. On both conceptions of logic\nwe deal with logical constants, the difference is that one deals with\na system of mental representations, the other with a system of\nlinguistic representations. Both, presumably, would deal with\ncorresponding sets of logical constants. Even though mental and\nlinguistic representations form different sets of representations,\nsince they are closely connected with each other, for every logical\nconstant in one of these sets of representations there will be another\none of the corresponding syntactic type and with the same content, or\nat least a corresponding inferential role.\n\n\n\nBut this conception of their relationship assumes that the\n\u201cgeneral features of judgments\u201d or \u201cforms of\njudgment\u201d which (L4) is concerned with deal with something like\nthe logical constants in the language of thought. Here the judgment as\na mental act is assumed to operate on a mental representation that\nitself has syntactic structure. And the form of the judgment was\nunderstood as the form of the representation that represents the\ncontent of the judgment, whereby the form of the representation was\nunderstood along the lines of (L2), involving logical constants. But\nwhat if we can\u2019t understand \u201cform of judgment\u201d or\n\u201cform of thought\u201d that way? One way this could fail is if\nthe language of thought hypothesis itself fails, and if mental states\ndo not involve representations that have something like a syntactic\nform. The question then becomes, first how should we understand\n\u2018form of judgement\u2019 more precisely, and secondly, how does\nlogic, as the discipline concerned with forms of judgments in the\nsense of (L4), relate to (L2)?\n\nOne way to answer the first question is to understand \u201cform of\njudgment\u201d as not being concerned with the representation that\nmight be involved in a judgment, but rather with the content of the\njudgment, i.e. with what the judgment is representing to be the case.\nContents of judgments can be seen as propositions, and these can be\nunderstood as entities that are structured, for example Russellian\npropositions. Such propositions are ordered sets whose members are\nobjects and properties. How such a conception of (L4) relates to (L2)\nwill in part depend on how one thinks of the logical constants in\nRussellian propositions. If they are higher-order properties or\nfunctions that are members of these propositions alongside other\nobjects and properties then presumably the logical constants have\ncontent. But this seems to be in conflict with an understanding of\n(L4) as being concerned with the form that is left once we abstract\nfrom all content. If would seem that on such an understanding of (L4)\none can\u2019t closely associate \u2018form of judgment\u2019,\nunderstood as what\u2019s left once we abstract from all content of\nthe judgment, with logical constants if the latter have content.\n\nAnother way to understand \u201cform\u201d as being concerned with\nwhat the judgment is about, rather than the judgment itself, is to\nthink of what it is about, the world, itself as having a form. In this\nsense we associate \u201cform\u201d neither with the representation\nthat is involved in the judgment, nor with the proposition which is\nits content, but rather with the world that is judged about. On such a\nconception the world itself has a form or basic structure. (L4) would\nbe concerned with this structure. How (L4) relates to (L2) is then a\nsomewhat tricky question. One way, again, could be that the logical\nconstants that (L2) is concerned with correspond to the structure of\nwhat a representation in which they occur is about, but don\u2019t\ncontribute to the content of that representation. This again seems\nincompatible with the logical constants themselves having content. So,\nwhether one associates form of judgment with the\n\u2018syntactic\u2019 structure of a representation that is involved\nin the judgment, or with the content of that representation, or with\nthe structure of what the representation is about, the relationship\nbetween (L4) and (L2) will in part depend on whether one thinks the\nlogical constants themselves contribute to content. If they do, and if\nform is contrasted with content, then a close association seems\nimpossible. If the logical constants don\u2019t have content, then it\nmight be possible.\n\nFinally, the relationship between (L1) and (L4) either comes down to\nthe same as that between (L1) and (L2), if we understand \u2018form\nof thought\u2019 analogous to \u2018form of representation\u2019.\nIf not, then it will again depend on how (L4) is understood more\nprecisely.\n\nThus there are many ways in which (L1), (L2), (L3), and (L4) are\nconnected, and many in which they are quite different.\n",
