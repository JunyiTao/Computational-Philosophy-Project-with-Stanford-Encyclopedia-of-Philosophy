    "main_text": "Repatriation\n3. Repatriation\n\nRepatriation concerns the return of material heritage or human remains\nfrom museums, universities, or other institutions to their culture,\nnation, or owner of origin. If an object was clearly stolen or\notherwise unjustly acquired from an identifiable group, then\nrepatriation can seem uncontroversial (at least from a moral\nperspective) on the basis of standard norms of reparative justice, as\nwould apply to any other stolen item. However, claims for repatriation\ncan become controversial in cases where 1) the justice of acquisition\nis unclear, 2) the source cultural group is unclear or not clearly\ncontiguous with a contemporary group, or 3) the value of institutional\nretention of disputed objects is thought to outweigh competing claims,\nespecially if these are weakened by the aforementioned concerns.\nArguments that aim to overcome these potential objections are\ngenerally couched in terms of either cultural property (3.1) or\nreparations for historical injustices\n (3.2).\n",
