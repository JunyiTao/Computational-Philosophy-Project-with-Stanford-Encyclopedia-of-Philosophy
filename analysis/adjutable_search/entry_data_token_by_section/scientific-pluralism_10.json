A related but distinct debate focuses on\nepistemic core concepts that scientists use during their\ninvestigation: explanation, experiment, evidence, knowledge, model,\nunderstanding, objectivity, observation, probability, and so on.\nPhilosophical analysis of such epistemic core concepts is often\ncharacterized by monist ambitions of developing general and unified\ndefinitions with necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nHistory of science has become one of the major sources of\ndestabilization for such unifying ambitions. The project of historical\nepistemology (Feest & Sturm 2011; Arabatzis & Schickore [eds.]\n2012; Rheinberger 2018) aims to historize the epistemic core concepts\nin science by analyzing their shifting boundaries and roles in\nscientific practice. For example, historians of science have argued\nthat appeals to objectivity have served a wide range of epistemic\nfunctions. Scientists have appealed to objectivity to emphasize\ndifferent epistemic values of their research from the goal of being\ntrue to nature through idealization to the goal to purify science\nthrough mechanical elimination of subjectivity to the aim to improve\nscientific judgment through skills of trained experts (Daston &\nGalison 2007).\n\nScientific pluralism converges with historical epistemology in\nemphasizing the variability of epistemic core concepts. Objectivity,\nfor example, may not only be historically variable but also have\ndifferent meanings in different contexts of current scientific\npractice. Douglas (2004) distinguishes between three dimensions:\nobjectivity1 is conceived metaphysically as a grasp of the real\nobjects in the world, objectivity2 refers to an epistemic position of\ndetachment from personal interests and values, and objectivity3\nidentifies the social process of organizing science to reduce\nindividual biases and idiosyncrasies. Similar strategies of conceptual\ndiversification are common regarding other epistemic core concepts.\nFor example, the expansive debates about explanatory pluralism\n (section 2.3)\n suggest that \u201cexplanation\u201d does not have one general\ndefinition across all scientific disciplines and contexts of\napplication. Instead, philosophical accounts of explanation need to\naccount\n\n\nfor different ideal types of explanation, i.e., different exemplary\naccounts of what an explanation consists of, which are good as means\nof classification of different types of explanatory activities that\nare offered in different domains. (Mantzavinos 2015: 306)\n\n\nEpistemic concepts such as \u201cexplanation\u201d and\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d are embedded in widely different research\nprograms and attempts to provide general definitions run the risk of\nobscuring this diversity by being biased towards certain domains of\nresearch from which the definition is derived. However, pluralism\nabout epistemic concepts is not a truism and can be challenged both\nfrom unificationist and eliminativist angles. First, unificationist\nattempts to develop general definitions may reduce contextual accuracy\nbut come with the benefit of highlighting commonalities of different\nuses of epistemic core concepts. Despite all of their contextual\nvariability, claims of objectivity may still involve a distinct form\nof epistemic endorsement: to call something objective is to rely on it\nand to suggest that others should rely on it (Koskinen 2020). Second,\npluralism can also be challenged from an eliminativist angle that\ntreats conceptual plurality as evidence of fragmentation that\nultimately undermines the usefulness of a concept. If\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d is used to highlight heterogenous epistemic\nvalues, it may be more helpful to analyze these values directly\n(Ludwig 2017) rather than to rely on an ambiguous and vague notion of\nobjectivity that provides not much more than an abstract honorary\nlabel (Hacking 1999).\n",
