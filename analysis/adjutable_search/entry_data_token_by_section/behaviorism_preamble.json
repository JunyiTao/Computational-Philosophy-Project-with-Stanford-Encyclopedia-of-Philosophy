The behavior, in particular,\nof individual organisms. Not of social groups. Not of cultures. But of\npersons and animals. \n\nThis entry considers different types of behaviorism and outlines\nreasons for and against being a behaviorist. It consider contributions\nof behaviorism to the study of behavior. Special attention is given to\nthe so-called \u201cradical behaviorism\u201d of B. F. Skinner\n(1904\u201390). Skinner is given special (not exclusive) attention\nbecause he is the behaviorist who has received the most attention from\nphilosophers, fellow scientists and the public at large. General\nlessons can also be learned from Skinner about the conduct of\nbehavioral science in general. The entry describes those lessons. \n",
