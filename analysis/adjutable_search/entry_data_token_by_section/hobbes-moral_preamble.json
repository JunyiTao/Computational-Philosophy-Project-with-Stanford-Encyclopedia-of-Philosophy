    "main_text": "\n\nThe 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is now\nwidely regarded as one of a handful of truly great political\nphilosophers, whose masterwork Leviathan rivals in\nsignificance the political writings of Plato, Aristotle, Locke,\nRousseau, Kant, and Rawls. Hobbes is famous for his early and\nelaborate development of what has come to be known as \u201csocial\ncontract theory\u201d, the method of justifying political principles\nor arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made among\nsuitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamous\nfor having used the social contract method to arrive at the\nastonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an\nabsolute\u2014undivided and unlimited\u2014sovereign power. While\nhis methodological innovation had a profound constructive impact on\nsubsequent work in political philosophy, his substantive conclusions\nhave served mostly as a foil for the development of more palatable\nphilosophical positions. Hobbes\u2019s moral philosophy has been less\ninfluential than his political philosophy, in part because that theory\nis too ambiguous to have garnered any general consensus as to its\ncontent. Most scholars have taken Hobbes to have affirmed some sort of\npersonal relativism or subjectivism; but views that Hobbes espoused\ndivine command theory, virtue ethics, rule egoism, or a form of\nprojectivism also find support in Hobbes\u2019s texts and among\nscholars. Because Hobbes held that \u201cthe true doctrine of the\nLawes of Nature is the true Morall philosophie\u201d, differences in\ninterpretation of Hobbes\u2019s moral philosophy can be traced to\ndiffering understandings of the status and operation of Hobbes\u2019s\n\u201claws of nature\u201d, which laws will be discussed below. The\nformerly dominant view that Hobbes espoused psychological egoism as\nthe foundation of his moral theory is currently widely rejected, and\nthere has been to date no fully systematic study of Hobbes\u2019s\nmoral psychology.\n",
