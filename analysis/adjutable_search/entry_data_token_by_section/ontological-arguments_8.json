    "main_text": "St. Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument\n9. St. Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument\n\nThere is an enormous literature on the material in Proslogion\nII-III. Some commentators deny that St. Anselm tried to put\nforward any proofs of the existence of God. Even among commentators\nwho agree that St. Anselm intended to prove the existence of God,\nthere is disagreement about where the proof is located. Some\ncommentators claim that the main proof is in Proslogion II,\nand that the rest of the work draws out corollaries of that proof\n(see, e.g., Charlesworth 1965). Other commentators claim that the main\nproof is in Prologion III, and that the proof in\nProslogion II is merely an inferior first attempt (see, e.g.,\nMalcolm 1960). Yet other commentators claim that there is a single\nproof which spans at least Proslogion II-III\u2014see, e.g.,\nCampbell 1976 and, perhaps, the entire work\u2014see, e.g., La Croix\n1972. In what follows, we ignore this aspect of the controversy about the\nProslogion. Instead, we focus just on the question of the\nanalysis of the material in Proslogion II on the assumption\nthat there is an independent argument for the existence of God which\nis given therein. \n\nHere is one translation of the crucial part of Proslogion II\n(due to William Mann (1972, 260\u20131); alternative translations can\nbe found in Barnes 1972, Campbell 1976, Charlesworth 1965, and\nelsewhere):\n\nThus even the fool is convinced that something than which nothing\ngreater can be conceived is in the understanding, since when he hears\nthis, he understands it; and whatever is understood is in the\nunderstanding. And certainly that than which a greater cannot be\nconceived cannot be in the understanding alone. For if it is even in\nthe understanding alone, it can be conceived to exist in reality also,\nwhich is greater. Thus if that than which a greater cannot be\nconceived is in the understanding alone, then that than which a\ngreater cannot be conceived is itself that than which a greater can be\nconceived. But surely this cannot be. Thus without doubt something\nthan which a greater cannot be conceived exists, both in the\nunderstanding and in reality.\n\n\nThere have been many ingenious attempts to find an argument which can\nbe expressed in modern logical formalism, which is logically valid,\nand which might plausibly be claimed to be the argument which\nis expressed in this passage. To take a few prime examples, Adams\n1971, Barnes 1972 and Oppenheimer and Zalta 1991 have all produced\nformally valid analyses of the argument in this passage. We begin with\na brief presentation of each of these analyses, preceded by a\npresentation of the formulation of the argument given by Plantinga\n1967, and including a presentation of some of the formulations of\nLewis 1970. (Chambers 2000 works with the analysis of Adams 1971.)\n9.1 Formulation 1\n\nGod exists in the understanding but not in reality. (Assumption for\nreductio)\nExistence in reality is greater than existence in the understanding\nalone. (Premise)\nA being having all of God\u2019s properties plus existence in reality\ncan be conceived. (Premise)\nA being having all of God\u2019s properties plus existence in reality\nis greater than God. (From (1) and (2).)\nA being greater than God can be conceived. (From (3) and\n(4).)\nIt is false that a being greater than God can be conceived. (From\ndefinition of \u201cGod\u201d.)\nHence, it is false that God exists in the understanding but not in\nreality. (From (1), (5), (6).)\nGod exists in the understanding. (Premise, to which even the Fool\nagrees.)\nHence God exists in reality. (From (7), (8).)\n\n\nSee Plantinga 1967.\n9.2 Formulation 2\n\nThe Fool understands the expression \u201cthe being than which no\ngreater can be conceived\u201d. (Premise)\nIf a person understands an expression \u201cb\u201d, then\nb is in that person\u2019s understanding. (Premise)\nIf a thing is in a person\u2019s understanding, then the person can\nconceive of that thing\u2019s existing in reality. (Premise)\nEach thing which exists in reality is greater than any thing which\nexists only in the understanding. (Premise)\nIf a person can conceive of something, and that thing entails\nsomething else, then the person can also conceive of that other thing.\n(Premise)\nIf a person can conceive that a specified object has a given property,\nthen that person can conceive that something or other has that\nproperty. (Premise)\nHence the being than which no greater can be conceived exists in\nreality. (From (1)-(6), by a complex series of steps here\nomitted.)\n\n\nSee Barnes 1972.\n9.3 Formulation 3\n\nThere is a thing x, and a magnitude m, such that\nx exists in the understanding, m is the magnitude of\nx, and it it not possible that there is a thing y\nand a magnitude n such that n is the magnitude of\ny and n>m. (Premise)\nFor any thing x and magnitude m, if x\nexists in the understanding, m is the magnitude of\nx, and it is not possible that there is a thing y\nand magnitude n such that n is the magnitude of\ny and n>m, then it is possible that\nx exists in reality. (Premise)\nFor any thing x and magnitude m, if m is\nthe magnitude of x, and it it not possible that there is a\nthing y and a magnitude n such that n is\nthe magnitude of y and n>m, and\nx does not exist in reality, then it is not possible that if\nx exists in reality then there is a magnitude n such\nthat n is greater than m and n is the\nmagnitude of x. (Premise)\n(Hence) There is a thing x and a magnitude m such\nthat x exist in the understanding, and x exists in\nreality, and m is the magnitude of x, and it it not\npossible that there is a thing y and a magnitude n\nsuch that n is the magnitude of y and\nn>m. (From 1, 2, 3)\n\n\nSee Adams 1971.\n9.4 Formulation 4\n\nFor any understandable being x, there is a world w\nsuch that x exists in w. (Premise)\nFor any understandable being x, and for any worlds w\nand v, if x exists in w, but x\ndoes not exist in v, then the greatness of x in\nw exceeds the greatness of x in v.\n(Premise)\nThere is an understandable being x such that for no world\nw and being y does the greatness of y in\nw exceed the greatness of x in the actual world.\n(Premise)\n(Hence) There is a being x existing in the actual world such\nthat for no world w and being y does the greatness\nof y in w exceed the greatness of x in the\nactual world. (From (1)-(3).)\n\n\nSee Lewis 1970.\n\nLewis also suggests an alternative to (3) which yields a valid\nargument:\n\n(3\u2032) There is an understandable being x such that for\nno worlds v and w and being y does the\ngreatness of y in w exceed the greatness of x in\nv.\n\n\nand two alternatives to (3)\u2014not presented here\u2014which yield\ninvalid arguments. (Of course, these further two alternatives are\ncrucial to Lewis\u2019 overall analysis of the passage: essentially,\nLewis suggests that Anselm equivocates between an invalid argument\nwith plausible premises and a valid argument with question-begging\npremises. In this respect, Lewis\u2019 analysis is quite different\nfrom the other analyses currently under discussion.)\n9.5 Formulation 5\n\nThere is (in the understanding) something than which there is no\ngreater. (Premise)\n(Hence) There is (in the understanding) a unique thing than which\nthere is no greater. (From (1), assuming that the\n\u201cgreater-than\u201d relation is connected.)\n(Hence) There is (in the understanding) something which is the thing\nthan which there is no greater. (From (2), by a theorem about\ndescriptions.)\n(Hence) There is (in the understanding) nothing which is greater than\nthe thing than which there is no greater. (From (3), by another\ntheorem about descriptions.)\nIf that thing than which there is no greater does not exist (in\nreality), then there is (in the understanding) something which is\ngreater than that thing than which there is no greater.\n(Premise)\n(Hence) That thing than which there is no greater exists (in reality).\n(From (4) and (5).)\n(Hence) God exists. (From (6).)\n\n\nSee Oppenheimer and Zalta 1991.\n\nOppenheimer and Zalta 2011 provides a \u201csimplified\u201d version\nof this argument, in which the number of controversial assumptions is\nreduced. Since they also provide a clear reason for thinking that this\nnew version of the argument is not persuasive, it won't be considered\nfurther here. \n9.6 Critical Appraisal\n\nConsidered as interpretations of the argument presented in the\nProslogion, these formulations are subject to various kinds\nof criticisms. \n\nFirst, the modal interpretations of Lewis 1970 and Adams 1971\ndon\u2019t square very well with the rest of the Proslogion:\nthe claim that \u201cbeing than which no greater can be\nconceived\u201d should be read as \u201cbeing than which no greater\nis possible\u201d would have us render the claim of Proslogion\n15 to be that God is a being greater than any which is possible.\nAnd that is surely a bad result.\n\nSecond, the Meinongian interpretations of Barnes 1972, Adams\n1971 and Oppenheimer and Zalta 1991 produce arguments which, given the\nprinciples involved, could easily be much simplified, and which are\nobviously vulnerable to Gaunilo-type objections.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of Oppenheimer and Zalta. They have\nAnselm committed to the claim that if anyone can understand the phrase\n\u201cthat than which F\u201d, then there is something in\nthe understanding such that F (see their footnote 25); and\nthey also have him committed to the claim that if there is something\nwhich is the F-thing, then it\u2014i.e., the\nF-thing\u2014has the property F (see page 7).\nPlainly though, if Anselm is really committed to these principles,\nthen he could hardly fail to be committed to the more general\nprinciples: (1) if anyone can understand the phrase \u201can\nF\u201d, then there is at least one F-thing in the\nunderstanding; and (2) if there are some things which are the\nF-things, then they\u2014i.e., the\nF-things\u2014must have the property F. (It would\nsurely be absurd to claim that Anselm is only committed to the less\ngeneral principles: what could possibly have justified the\nrestrictions to the special cases?)\n\nBut, then, mark the consequences. We all understand the expression\n\u201can existent perfect being\u201d. So, by the first claim, there\nis at least one existent perfect being in the understanding. And, by\nthe second claim, any existent perfect being is existent. So, from\nthese two claims combined, there is\u2014in reality\u2014at least\none existent perfect being.\n\nThis argument gives Anselm everything that he wants, and very much\nmore briefly. (The Proslogion goes on and on, trying to\nestablish the properties of that than which no greater can be\nconceived. How much easier if we can just explicitly build all of the\nproperties which want to \u201cderive\u201d into the initial\ndescription.) So, if Anselm really were committed to the principles\nwhich Oppenheimer and Zalta appear to attribute to him, it is hard to\nunderstand why he didn\u2019t give the simpler argument. And, of\ncourse, it is also hard to understand why he didn\u2019t take\nGaunilo\u2019s criticism. After all, when it is set out in this way,\nit is obvious that the argument proves far too much.\n\nThird, some of the arguments have Anselm committed to claims\nabout greatness which do not seem to correspond with what he actually\nsays. The natural reading of the text is that, if two beings are\nidentical save that one exists only in the understanding and the other\nexists in reality as well, then the latter is greater than the former.\nBut Barnes 1971, for example, has Anselm committed to the much\nstronger claim that any existing thing is greater than every\nnon-existent thing.\n\nGiven these kinds of considerations, it is natural to wonder whether\nthere are better interpretations of Proslogion II\naccording to which the argument in question turns out NOT to\nbe logically valid. Here is a modest attempt to provide such an\nanalysis:\n\nWe start with the claim that the Fool understands the expression\n\u201cbeing than which no greater can be conceived\u201d, i.e., even\nthe Fool can entertain the idea or possess the concept of a being than\nwhich no greater can be conceived. Now, entertaining this idea or\npossessing this concept requires the entertainer or possessor to\nrecognise certain relationships which hold between given properties\nand the idea or concept in question. For example, given that you\npossess the concept of, or entertain the idea of, a smallest really\nexistent Martian, it follows that you must recognise some kind of\nconnection between the properties of being a Martian, really existing,\nand being smaller than other really existing Martians, and the concept\nor idea in question.\n\nFollowing Anselm, we might say that, since you understand the\nexpression \u201csmallest really existent Martian\u201d, there is,\nin your understanding, at least one smallest really existent Martian.\n(Or, apparently following Descartes, one might say that real existence\nis \u201cpart of\u201d\u2014or \u201ccontained in\u201d\u2014the\nidea of a smallest really existent Martian.) However, in saying this,\nit must be understood that we are not actually predicating properties\nof anything: we aren\u2019t supposing that there is something which\npossesses the properties of being a Martian, really existing, and\nbeing no larger than any other Martian. (After all, we can safely\nsuppose, we don\u2019t think that any Martians really exist.) In\nother words, we must be able to have the concept of, or entertain the\nidea of, a smallest really existing Martian without believing that\nthere really are any smallest Martians. Indeed, more strongly, we must\nbe able to entertain the concept of a smallest really existent\nMartian\u2014and to recognise that the property of \u201creally\nexisting\u201d is part of this concept\u2014while nonetheless\nmaintaining that there are no smallest existent Martians.\n\nIt will be useful to introduce vocabulary to mark the point which is\nbeing made here. We could, for instance, distinguish between the\nproperties which are encoded in an idea or concept, and the\nproperties which are attributed in positive atomic beliefs\nwhich have that idea or concept as an ingredient. The idea\n\u201creally existent Santa Claus\u201d encodes the property of real\nexistence; but it is perfectly possible to entertain this idea without\nattributing real existence to Santa Claus, i.e., without believing\nthat Santa Claus really exists.\n\nWe can then apply this distinction to Anselm\u2019s argument. On the\none hand, the idea \u201cbeing than which no greater can be\nconceived\u201d encodes the property of real existence\u2014this is\nwhat the reductio argument establishes (if it establishes\nanything at all). On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to\nentertain the idea of a being than which no greater can be\nconceived\u2014and to recognise that this idea encodes the property\nof real existence\u2014without attributing real existence to a being\nthan which no greater can be conceived, i.e., without believing that a\nbeing than which no greater can be conceived really exists.\n\nOf course, the argument which Anselm actually presents pays no\nattention to this distinction between encoding and\nattributing\u2014i.e., between entertaining an idea and holding a\nbelief\u2014and nor does it pay attention to various other niceties.\nWe begin from the point that the Fool entertains the idea of that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived (because the Fool understands the\nwords \u201cthat than which no greater can be conceived\u201d). From\nthis, we move quickly to the claim that even the Fool is\n\u201cconvinced\u201d\u2014i.e., believes\u2014that that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived possesses the property of existing\nin the understanding. And then the reductio argument is\nproduced to establish that that than which no greater can be conceived\ncannot exist only in the understanding but must also possess the\nproperty of existing in reality as well (and all mention of the Fool,\nand what it is that the Fool believes, disappears).\n\nAs it stands, this is deeply problematic. How are we supposed to\nregiment the references to the Fool in the argument? Is the\nreductio argument supposed to tell us something about what\neven the Fool believes, or ought to believe? Are the earlier\nreferences to the Fool supposed to be inessential and eliminable? How\nare we so much as to understand the claim that even the Fool believes\nthat that than which no greater can be conceived exists in the\nunderstanding? And how do we get from the Fool\u2019s\nunderstanding the words \u201cthat than which no greater can\nbe conceived\u201d to his believing that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived possesses the property of existing in the\nunderstanding?\n\nFollowing the earlier line of thought, it seems that the\nargument might go something like this:\n\n\n\n(Even) the Fool has the concept of that than which no greater can be\nconceived.\n\n\n(Hence) (Even) the Fool believes that that than which no greater can\nbe conceived exists in the understanding.\n\n\nNo one who believes that that than which no greater can be conceived\nexists in the understanding can reasonably believe that that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived exists only in the\nunderstanding.\n\n\n(Hence) (Even) the Fool cannot reasonably deny that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived exists in reality\n\n\n(Hence) That than which no greater can be conceived exists in\nreality.\n\n\nWhile this is not a good argument, it could appear compelling to one\nwho failed to attend to the distinction between entertaining ideas and\nholding beliefs and who was a bit hazy on the distinction between the\nvehicles of belief and their contents. When the Fool entertains the\nconcept of that than which no greater can be conceived he recognises\nthat he is entertaining this concept (i.e., he believes that he is\nentertaining the concept of that than which no greater can be\nconceived\u2014or, as we might say, that the concept is in his\nunderstanding). Conflating the concept with its object, this gives us\nthe belief that than which no greater can be conceived possesses the\nproperty of existing in the understanding. Now, suppose as hypothesis\nfor reductio, that we can reasonably believe that that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived possesses the property of existing\nonly in the understanding. Ignoring the distinction between\nentertaining ideas and holding beliefs, this means that we when we\nentertain the idea of that than which no greater can be conceived, we\nentertain the idea of a being which exists only in the understanding.\nBut that is absurd: when we entertain the idea of that than which no\ngreater can be conceived, our idea encodes the property of existing in\nreality. So there is a contradiction, and we can conclude that, in\norder to be reasonable, we must believe that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived exists in reality. But if any reasonable\nperson must believe that that than which no greater can be conceived\nexists in reality, then surely it is the case that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived exists in reality. And so we are done.\n\nNo doubt this suggestion about the interpretation of Anselm\u2019s\nargument is deficient in various ways. However, the point of including\nit is illustrative rather than dogmatic. In the literature, there has\nbeen great resistance to the idea that the argument which Anselm gives\nis one which modern logicians would not hesitate to pronounce invalid.\nBut it is very hard to see why there should be this resistance.\n(Certainly, it is not something for which there is much argument in\nthe literature.) The text of the Proslogion is so rough, and\nso much in need of polishing, that we should not be too quick to\ndismiss the suggestion that Anselm\u2019s argument is rather more\nlike the argument most recently sketched than it is like the logically\nvalid demonstrations provided by commentators such as Barnes, Adams,\nand Oppenheimer and Zalta. (For a more complex analysis of\nProslogion II that has it yielding a valid argument, see\nHinst 2014.)\n",
