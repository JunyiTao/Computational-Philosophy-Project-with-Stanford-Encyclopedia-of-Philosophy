    "main_text": "Axiology/Value Theory || Value-Feelings and Value-Modes\n2.1 Value-Feelings and Value-Modes\n\nLocke begins by considering what he takes to be the most basic feature\nof values; their emotional character. He writes\n\nthe value-mode establishes for itself, directly through feeling, a\nqualitative category which, as discriminated by its appropriate\nfeeling-quality, constitutes an emotionally mediated form of\nexperience. (VI 38)\n\n\nThere is a particular feeling or feeling-quality associated with each\nvalue-mode. In fact, Locke contends that value-modes differ in virtue\nof differences in feeling-qualities. The value-mode, or perhaps\nbetter, the mode of valuing, refers to the qualitative character of a\nparticular way of experiencing as mediated by a given emotion or\nattitude which Locke terms the feeling-quality. This has several\nimportant implications for the general theory of value: predicating a\nvalue to a subject depends on the feeling-quality associated with it;\nvalues are immediately recognized through an apprehension of their\nemotional quality; value-predicates are determined by the affective\nand volitional influence of the feeling-quality; and the imperatives\nof a given value are given immediately once the primary\nfeeling-quality has been established.\n\nLocke claims that there is a necessary connection between the\nfeeling-quality and the value-mode with the former determining the\nlater. The value-mode is normally established as the value is being\napprehended. If this were not the case, the value-mode would be\nindeterminate even while its immediate quality is being felt. The\nbasic categories of value are not rational: one cannot simply reason\none's way to an understanding of them. In developing and articulating\nhis axiology, Locke looks for the categories of value in the actual\nvaluations of human beings. Rather than predetermining the categories\nof valuation and attempting to cram experiences of values into them,\nhis theory begins with our concrete valuations and determines which if\nany features they have in common. It is then on the basis of the\ncommonalities observed to obtain between particular experiences of\nvalues that they are classed together as members of the same class.\nLocke writes,\n\n[f]lesh and blood values may not be as universal or objective as\nlogical truth or schematized judgments, but they are not thereby\ndeprived of some relative objectivity and universality of their own.\nThe basic qualities of values\u2026pertain to psychological\ncategories. They are not grounded in types of realms of value, but are\nrooted in modes or kinds of valuing. (VI 38)\n\n\nLocke is aware that it is not easy to demonstrate that the fundamental\nidentity and unity of a value-mode depends on a feeling-quality. It\nmay be that the position thus far articulated is merely hypothetical\nand speculative and requires an experimental methodology to prove it.\nLocke notes that the main objections to the position have been\naddresses by developments in the Gestalt psychology insofar as it has\nestablished an empirical basis for a comprehensive perceptual scheme\nfunctioning in recognition, comparison and choice. Further\ncircumstantial evidence is offered for the position by the phenomenon\nof transvaluation (see\n section 2.3\n below).\n",
