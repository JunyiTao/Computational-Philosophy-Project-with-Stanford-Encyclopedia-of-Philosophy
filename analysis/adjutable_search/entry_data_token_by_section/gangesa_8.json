    "main_text": "Perception || Apperception\n4.3 Apperception\n\n\u201cApperception,\u201d anuvyavas\u0101ya, is defined as\na perception taking a preceding cognition or another psychological\nproperty as its object, typically a scoping cognition in relation to\nanother scoped (Phillips 2012: 48\u201350). Efforts and desires can\nbe similarly targeted. Through apperception, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nclaims, one knows infallibly the intentionality, the\n\u201cobjecthood,\u201d vi\u1e63ayat\u0101, of the\ncognition scoped, in its qualificandum, qualifier, and relational\nportions. One knows, in other words, what the scoped purports to be\nabout, and one knows this independently of a determination of the\ntarget\u2019s being knowledge or not. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba argues that\nsince the sensory connection in this case is not mediated by a\nmaterial organ, apperception is infallible about the contents of the\nscoped, but not of course about its truth. He devotes a long section\nof his perception chapter to defending this and other views about\napperception in the face of opponents claiming he is giving up central\nplanks of his theory.\n\nApperception makes certification possible because it sets up the item\nto be certified, showing the type of cognition the scoped is. Our\napperceptive ability to determine whether the scoped cognition is\nputatively perceptual, inferential, analogical, testimonial, or of\nanother character has epistemic relevance, since, as with all\nperception, there would be a presumption in favor of its correctness.\nThus there would also be restoration of a presumption of the truth for\na scoped cognition that had been brought into doubt were it judged to\nbe perceptual, inferential, analogical, or testimonial in character,\nalthough further examination might prove the identification wong. Note\nthat if further examination were called for, its direction would be\ndetermined by the apperception of cognitive type. For, the criteria of\ngenuine perception, inference, and the rest vary according to origin.\nThe characteristic epistemic merits and flaws (gu\u1e47a and\ndo\u1e63a) are very different for each knowledge source and\nthere are also significant differences within species of perception in\nparticular. Thus apperceptive judgment of putative type directs\ninquiry, telling us what to check.\n\nCorollary to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s thesis of the apperceptibility\nof cognitive types is his view that illusion can be scoped such that\nthere too we find, abstractly, a cognition of an object as qualified\nby a qualifier, for example, of a piece of tin appearing to be silver.\nHe also presents the argument that the fact that we can later see the\nsame thing as really the tin it is shows that the illusion is a single\ncognition and not, contra the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara, two cognitions, a\nperception and a remembering along with a failure to notice their\ndifference. But scoping an illusory awareness is supposed to show\nthis, too, and in a particularly dramatic way when one knows that the\ncognition is illusory while it continues, such as apparent sight of a\ndouble moon or a person with hepatitis seeing a wall she knows is\nwhite as yellow. Although apperception is said not in itself to be\nable to determine the veridicality of an awareness, in such a case the\nsubject practically sees one thing (the wall) appearing to be\nsomething it is not (yellow), anyath\u0101-khy\u0101ti.\n",
