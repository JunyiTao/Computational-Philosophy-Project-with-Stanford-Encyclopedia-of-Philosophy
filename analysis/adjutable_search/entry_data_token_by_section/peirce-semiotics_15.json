    "main_text": "The Final Account: 1906\u201310 || Dividing the Interpretant\n4.3 Issues with the Final Account\n\nThis identification of the six elements of a sign is the clearest and\nleast controversial part of Peirce\u2019s final sign theories. Most of what\nwe know about Peirce\u2019s final account is gleaned from letters,\npartially worked out manuscripts and other miscellaneous items.\nConsequently, there is much to the final account that is still\nunclear, unsatisfactory, incomplete, and controversial. In this final\nsection, we shall look at two of the most interesting issues\nsurrounding the final account: Peirce\u2019s projected Final Classification\nof sixty-six signs; and what appears to be his identification of\nadditional interpretants.\n4.3.1 The Final Classification\n\nJust as the Early and Interim Accounts include a corresponding\nclassification of sign types, Peirce\u2019s final account holds similar\ntypological ambitions. Peirce states explicitly that there are\nsixty-six classes of sign in his final typology. (See EP2. 481).\nStrictly speaking, the six elements that we have detailed yield only\ntwenty eight sign types, but we are interested in Peirce\u2019s very final\ntypology. He believes that we can obtain these sixty-six classes,\nrather in the manner of the 1903 typology, by identifying ten elements\nof signs and signification, each of which has three qualifying\nclasses, and then working out their permissible combinations. These\nten elements include the six sign elements identified above, plus four\nother elements that focus on the relation between signs, objects and\ninterpretants. The ten elements and their respective sign types, taken\nfrom Peirce\u2019s 1908 letters to Lady Welby (EP2 483\u2013491), then,\nare as follows:\n\nIn respect of the Sign itself (what we have been calling the\nSign-Vehicle), a sign may be either a (i) Potisign (ii) Actisign or\n(iii) a Famisign.\n\n\n(By the time of the final accounts, Peirce was experimenting with\nterminology so these types are perhaps more familiar as Qualisigns,\nSinsigns and Legisigns).\n \nIn respect of the Immediate Object, a sign may be either i)\nDescriptive (ii) Designative or (iii) a Copulant.\nIn respect of the Dynamic Object, a sign may be either (i)\nAbstractive (ii) Concretive or (iii) Collective.\nIn respect of relation between the Sign and the Dynamic Object, a\nsign may be either, (i) an Icon (ii) an Index or (iii) a Symbol.\nIn respect of the Immediate Interpretant, a sign may be either (i)\nEjaculative, (ii) Imperative or (iii) Significative.\nIn respect of the Dynamic Interpretant, a sign may be either (i)\nSympathetic (ii) Shocking or (iii) Usual.\nIn respect of the relationship between the Sign and Dynamic\nInterpretant, a sign may be either (i) Suggestive (ii) Imperative or\n(iii) Indicative.\nIn respect of the Final Interpretant, a sign may be either, (i)\nGratiffic (ii) Action Producing or iii) Self-Control Producing.\nIn respect of the relation between the Sign and the Final\nInterpretant, a sign may be either a (i) Seme (ii) Pheme or (iii) a\nDelome.\nIn respect of the relation between the Sign, Dynamic Object and\nFinal Interpretant, a sign may be either (i) an Assurance of Instinct\n(ii) an Assurance of Experience or (iii) an Assurance of Form.\n\n\nThe reason that Peirce believes these ten elements will yield\nsixty-six classes is clear enough, the same combinatorial\nconsiderations given for the interim typology (outlined above in 3.4)\napply here. However, the precise manner and order in which these\nelements interact will determine what the sixty-six classes of signs\nwill look like in the final typology. Unfortunately, these ten\ndivisions and their classes represent a baffling array of\nunder-explained terminology, and there is little to indicate precisely\nhow we should set about the task of combining them. Even though we may\nbe confident on the number of signs in the final typology, other\ndetails are sketchy and underdeveloped, and there still exists no\nfully satisfactory account of the sixty-six classes. As Nathan Houser\npoints out, \u201ca sound and detailed extension of Peirce\u2019s analysis\nof signs to his full set of ten divisions and sixty-six classes is\nperhaps the most pressing problem for Peircian semiotics\u201d.\n(Houser 1992, 502).\n\nThere is, of course, good work on the final typology (see (Burks and\nWeiss 1949), (Sanders 1970), (Savan 1988), (Jappy 1989), (Jappy 2017),\n(Short 2007), (Muller 1994), and (Farias and Queiroz 2003) for the\nbest of this work), but ultimately, it is not clear that any account\nwill overcome the problems posed by the incomplete and cursory nature\nof the final account. Indeed, it is not clear that Peirce himself was\nfully at ease with his final typology and how its elements should hang\ntogether. As he himself said:\n\nThe ten divisions appear to me to be all Trichotomies; but it is\npossible that none of them are properly so. Of these ten Trichotomies,\nI have a clear apprehension of some, an unsatisfactory and doubtful\nnotion of others, and a tolerable but not thoroughly tried conception\nof others. (EP2. 483)\n\n\nDespite Peirce\u2019s own admission of doubts here, there is an\nongoing concern among Peirce scholars to determine the\nimportance of the later account and typology. Amongst the more\npositive positions in this debate, we see arguments that\nPeirce\u2019s later typology is crucial to a full understanding and\napplication of semiotics (see Quieroz 2012), or claims that it\nwhilst underdeveloped, it holds promise and deserves serious effort\nand attention (see Houser 1992 and Jappy 2017). More pessimistic\nPeirce scholars hold that the typology is either incoherent (see\nShort 2007), or that as an increasingly narrow classificatory\nproject, it runs counter to the more emergent and systemic properties\nof Peirce\u2019s semiotics (see Lizska 2019).\n4.3.2 Additional Interpretants\n\nAs is common with all of Peirce\u2019s work in philosophy, various changes\nin terminology and subtleties with accompanying neologisms occur from\none piece of work to the next. His work on interpretants is no\ndifferent. At various points in his final accounts of signs, Peirce\ndescribes the division of interpretants as being: immediate, dynamic\nand final; or as emotional, energetic, and logical; or as na\u00efve,\nrogate and normal; or as intentional, effective and communicational;\nor even destinate, effective and explicit. As Liszka (1990, 20) notes,\n\u201cthe received view in Peirce scholarship suggests that the\ndivisions of interpretant into immediate, dynamic, and final are\narchetypal, all other divisions being relatively synonymous with these\ncategories.\u201d There are, however, some dissenters from this\nview.\n\nIn discussing the interpretant, Peirce describes one of the\ntrichotomies above as follows:\n\nIn all cases [the Interpretant] includes feelings; for there must, at\nleast, be a sense of comprehending the meaning of the sign. If it\nincludes more than mere feeling, it must evoke some kind of effort. It\nmay include something besides, which, for the present, may be vaguely\ncalled \u201cthought\u201d. I term these three kinds of interpretant\nthe \u201cemotional\u201d, the \u201cenergetic\u201d, and the\n\u201clogical\u201d interpretants. (EP2. 409)\n\n\nFor some scholars, this describes a division distinct from the\nimmediate/dynamic/final trichotomy. Fitzgerald (1966, 78) claims that\nsince emotional, energetic and logical interpretants are actual\neffects, they must be seen as three sub-types of the dynamic\ninterpretant. This is because dynamic interpretants are described by\nPeirce as the effect actually produced on the mind. Short (1981, 1996,\nand 2004) thinks that each of the immediate, dynamic and final\ninterpretants may be further sub-divided into emotional, energetic and\nlogical. In particular, Short thinks that the immediate/dynamic/final\ntrichotomy describes the interpretant at some stage of an end-directed\nsemiotic process, whereas the emotional/energetic/logical trichotomy\ndescribes the types of interpretant possible at any given stage.\n\nThere are simple textual reasons that count against Fitzgerald\u2019s\nclaims. For instance, Peirce describes the dynamic interpretant as\nderiving its character from action (CP8 .315 1904), but later says,\n\u201caction cannot be a logical interpretant\u201d (CP5 .491\n1906). This seems to make the two inconsistent. (See Liszka (1990,\n21) for more on the problems with Fitzgerald\u2019s claim). Moreover, this\ninconsistency seems to suggest a problem for Short\u2019s view since his\naccount also suggests that the dynamic interpretant should include the\nlogical interpretant as a subdivision (Short 1981, 213). Short,\nhowever, claims textual support for his own view from instances where\nPeirce mentions the emotional/energetic/logical trichotomy alongside\nthe apparently separate claim that signs have three interpretants.\n(Short sites (CP8 .333 1904) and (CP4 .536 1906). Short takes this\nas suggesting that the two should be treated as different and distinct\ntrichotomies. (Short 2004, 235).\n\nHow far the textual evidence on the matter will prove decisive is\nunclear, especially given the fragmentary nature of Peirce\u2019s final\nwork on signs. However, one or two things militate in favor of the\n\u201creceived view\u201d. First, Peirce is notorious for\nexperimenting with terminology, especially when trying to pin down his\nown ideas, or describe the same phenomenon from different angles.\nSecond, it is unclear why trichotomies like the\nintentional/effectual/communicational should count as terminological\nexperiments whilst the emotional/energetic/logical counts as a\ndistinct division. And finally, there is little provision in Peirce\u2019s\nprojected sixty-six classes of signs for the kind of additional\nclassifications imposed by further subdivisions of the interpretant.\n(For more on this discussion see, Liszka 1990 and 1996; Fitzgerald\n1966; Lalor 1997; Short 1981, 1996, and 2004).\n",
