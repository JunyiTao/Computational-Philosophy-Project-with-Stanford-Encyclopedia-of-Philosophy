These also make use of classical logic, but base their\nsolutions primarily on some ideas from the philosophy of language.\nThey take the basic lesson of the Liar to be that truth predicates\nshow some form of context dependence, even in otherwise\nnon-context-dependent fragments of a language. They seek to explain\nhow this can be so, and rely on it to resolve the problems faced by\nthe Liar.\n\nContextualist theories share with a number of approaches we have\nalready seen the idea that there is something indeterminate or\nsemantically not well-formed about our Liar sentence \\(L\\). But,\ncontextualist views give a special role to issues of\n\u2018revenge\u2019 and lack of expressive power.\n4.4.1 Instability and revenge\n\nOne way of thinking about why the truth predicate is not well-behaved\non the Liar sentence is that there is not really a well-defined truth\nbearer provided by the Liar sentence. To make this vivid (as discussed\nby C. Parsons (1974)), suppose that truth bearers are propositions\nexpressed by sentences in contexts, and that the Liar sentence fails\nto express a proposition. This is the beginnings of an account of how\nthe Liar winds up ungrounded or in some sense indeterminate. At least,\nwe should not expect \\(\\Tr\\) to be well-behaved where sentences fail\nto express propositions.\n\nBut, it is an unstable proposal. We can reason that if the Liar\nsentence fails to express a proposition, it fails to express a true\nproposition. In the manner of a revenge paradox, if our Liar sentence\nhad originally said \u2018this sentence does not express a true\nproposition\u2019, then we would have our Liar sentence back. And, we\nhave shown that this sentence says something true, and so expresses a\ntrue proposition. Thus, from the assumption that the Liar sentence is\nindeterminate or lacks semantic status, we reason that it must have\nproper semantic status, and indeed say something true. We are hence\nback in paradox.\n\nContextualists do not see this as a new \u2018revenge\u2019 paradox,\nbut the basic problem posed by the Liar. First of all, in a setting\nwhere sentences are context dependent, the natural formulation of a\ntruth claim is always in terms of expressing a true proposition, or\nsome related semantically careful application of the truth predicate.\nBut more importantly, to the contextualist, the main issue behind the\nLiar is embodied in the reasoning on display here. It involves two key\nsteps. First, assigning the Liar semantically defective\nstatus\u2014failing to express a proposition or being somehow\nindeterminate. Second, concluding from the first step that the Liar\nmust be true\u2014and so not indeterminate or failing to express a\nproposition\u2014after all. Both steps appear to be the result of\nsound reasoning, and so the conclusions reached at both must be true.\nThe main problem of the Liar, according to a contextualist, is to\nexplain how this can be, and how the second step can be\nnon-paradoxical. (Such reasoning is explored by Glanzberg (2004c) and\nC. Parsons (1974). For a critical discussion, see Gauker (2006).)\n\nThus, contextualists seek to explain how the Liar sentence can have\nunstable semantic status, switching from defective to non-defective in\nthe course of this sort of inference. They do so by appealing to the\nrole of context in fixing the semantic status of sentences.\nSentences can have different semantic status in different contexts.\nThus, to contextualists, there must be some non-trivial effect of\ncontext involved in the Liar sentence, and more generally, in\npredication of truth.\n4.4.2 Contextual parameters on truth predicates\n\nOne prominent contextualist approach, advocated by Burge (1979) and\ndeveloped by Koons (1992) and Simmons (1993), starts with the idea\nthat the Tarskian hierarchy itself offers a way to see the truth\npredicate as context dependent. Tarski\u2019s hierarchy postulates a\nhierarchy of truth predicates \\(\\Tr_i\\). What if \\(i\\) is not merely a\nmarker of level in a hierarchy, but a genuine contextual parameter? If\nso, then the Liar sentence is in fact context-dependent: it has the\nform \\(\\neg \\Tr_i (\\left\\ulcorner L\\right\\urcorner)\\), where \\(i\\) is\nset by context. Context then sets the level of the truth\npredicate.\n\nThis idea can be seen as an improvement on the original Tarskian\napproach in several respects. First, once we have a contextual\nparameter, the need to insist that Liar sentences are never\nwell-formed disappears. Hence, we can think of each \\(\\Tr_i\\) as\nincluding some limited range of applicability to sentences of its own\nlanguage. Using the Kripkean techniques likes the closed-off\nconstruction we reviewed above, predicates like \\(\\Tr_i\\) can be\nconstructed which have as much self-applicability as Kripke\u2019s\nown. (Burge 1979 and the postscript to C. Parsons 1974 consider\nbriefly how Kripkean techniques could be applied in this setting.\nThough he works in a very different setting, ideas of Gaifman (1988,\n1992) can be construed as showing how even more subtle ways of\ninterpreting a context-dependent truth predicate can be\ndeveloped.)\n\nWith suitable care, other problems for the Tarskian hierarchy can be\navoided as well. Burge proposes that the parameter \\(i\\) in \\(\\Tr_i\\)\nis set by a Gricean pragmatic process. In effect, speakers implicate\nthat \\(i\\) is to be set to a level for which the discourse they are in\ncan be coherently interpreted (with a maximal coherent extension for\n\\(\\Tr_i)\\). Thus, truth does indeed find its own level, and so\nKripke\u2019s objection about how to fix levels for non-paradoxical\nsentences may be countered.\n\nThis approach gives substance to the idea that the Liar sentence is\ncontext dependent. Any sentence containing \\(\\Tr_i\\) will be context\ndependent, inheriting a contextual parameter along the way. This\noffers a way to make sense of the arguments for the instability of the\nsemantic status of \\(L\\) that motivated contextualism. In an initial\ncontext, we fix some level \\(i\\). This is the level at which \\(L\\) is\ninterpreted. Call this interpretation \\(L_i . L_i\\) says \\(\\neg \\Tr_i\n(\\left\\ulcorner L_{i}\\right\\urcorner)\\). By the usual Liar reasoning,\nwe show that \\(L_i\\) must lack determinate semantic status\u2014or\nfail to express a proposition. As we discussed, we then reason that\n\\(L\\) must come out true. According to the contextualist view at hand,\nthis is the claim that \\(L_i\\) is true according to some other\ncontext, where a wider truth predicate is in play. This amounts to\nbeing true at some higher level of the hierarchy. We can conclude, for\ninstance, that the Liar sentence as it was used at level \\(i\\) is true\naccording to a wider level \\(k \\gt i\\). Hence, \\(\\Tr_k (\\left\\ulcorner\nL_{i}\\right\\urcorner)\\), where \\(k \\gt i\\).\n\nThis form of contextualism thus maintains that once we see the\ncontext-dependent behavior of \\(\\Tr_i\\), we can make good sense of the\ninstability of \\(L\\). This can be seen as an improvement on both the\nTarskian view, and embodying some of the techniques of classical logic\nwe reviewed in\n \u00a74.2.\n Depending how the Burge view is spelled out technically, it will\neither have full capture and release at each level, or capture and\nrelease with the same restrictions as the closed-off Kripke\nconstruction.\n\nThe view that posits contextual parameters on the truth predicate does\nface a number of questions. For instance, it is fair to ask why we\nthink the truth predicate really has a contextual parameter,\nespecially if we mean a truth predicate like the one we use in natural\nlanguage. Merely noting that such a parameter would avoid paradox does\nnot show that it is present in natural language. Furthermore, whether\nit is acceptable to see truth as coming in levels at all,\ncontext-based or not, remains disputed. (Not all those who advocate\ncontextual parameters on the truth predicate agree about the role of\nhierarchy. In particular, Simmons (1993) advocates a view he labels\nthe \u2018singularity theory\u2019 which he proposes avoids outright\nhierarchical structures.) Finally, the Burgean appeal to Gricean\nmechanisms to set levels of truth has been challenged. (For instance,\nGaifman (1992) asks if the Gricean process does any substantial work\nin Burge\u2019s account.)\n\nContextualist approaches come in many varieties, each of which makes\nuse of slightly different apparatus. With contextualist theories the\nchoice often turns on issues in philosophy of language as well as\nlogic. We already noted a different way of developing contextualist\nideas from Gaifman (1988, 1992). We will now briefly review a few more\nalternatives.\n4.4.3 Contextual effects on quantifier domains\n\nAnother contextualist approach, stemming from work of C. Parsons\n(1974), seeks to build up the context dependence of the Liar sentence,\nand ultimately the context dependence of the truth predicate, from\nmore basic components. The key is to see the context dependence of the\nLiar sentence as derived from the context dependence of quantifier\ndomains.\n\nQuantification enters the picture when we think about how to account\nfor predication of truth when sentences display context dependence. In\nsuch an environment, it does not make good sense to predicate truth of\nsentences directly. Not all sentences will have the right kind of\ndeterminate semantic properties to be truth bearers; or, as we have\nbeen putting it, not all sentences will express propositions. But\nthen, to say that a sentence \\(S\\) is true in context \\(c\\) is to say\nthat there is a proposition \\(p\\) expressed by \\(S\\) in\n\\(c\\), and that proposition \\(p\\) is true.\n\nThe current contextualist proposal starts with the observation that\nquantifiers in natural language typically have context-dependent\ndomains of quantification. When we say \u2018Everyone is here\u2019,\nwe do not mean everyone in the world, but everyone in some\ncontextually provided subdomain. Context dependence enters the Liar,\naccording to this contextualist view, in the contextual effects on the\ndomain of the propositional quantifier \\(\\exists p\\).\n\nIn particular, this domain must expand in the course of the\nreasoning about the semantic status of the Liar. In the initial\ncontext, \\(\\exists p\\) must range over a small enough domain that\nthere is no proposition for \\(L\\) to express. In the subsequent\ncontext, the domain expands to allow \\(L\\) to express some true\nproposition. Proposals for how this expansion happens, and how to\nmodel the truth predicate and the relation of expressing a proposition\nin the presence of the Liar, have been explored by Glanzberg (2001,\n2004a), building on work of C. Parsons (1974). Defenders of this\napproach argue that it does better in locating the locus of context\ndependence than the parameters on truth predicates view.\n4.4.4 Situation theory\n\nAnother variant on the contextualist strategy for resolving the Liar,\ndeveloped by Barwise and Etchemendy (1987) and Groeneveld (1994),\nrelies on situation theory rather than quantifier domains to\nprovide the locus of context dependence. Situation theory is a highly\ndeveloped part of philosophy of language, so we shall again give only\nthe roughest sketch of how their view works.\n\nA situation is a partial state the world might be in: something like\n\\(a\\) being \\(F\\). Situations are classified by what are called\nsituation types. A proposition involves classifying a situation as\nbeing of a situation type. Thus, a proposition \\(\\{s\\); [\\(\\sigma]\\}\\)\ntell us that situation \\(s\\) is of type \\(\\sigma\\). The situation\n\\(s\\) here plays a number of roles, including that of providing a\ncontext.\n\nWhen it comes to the Liar, Barwise and Etchemendy construe Liar\npropositions as having the form \\(f_s = \\{s\\); [\\(\\Tr,f_s\\); 0]\\(\\}\\),\nrelative to an initial situation \\(s\\). This is a proposition \\(f_s\\)\nwhich says of itself that its falsity is a fact that holds in \\(s\\).\n(In Barwise and Etchemendy\u2019s notation, the 0 indicates falsity,\nso the situation type is that the state of affairs of the proposition\nbeing false holds. The proposition says this is a fact that holds in\n\\(s\\).) There is a sense in which this proposition cannot be\nexpressed. In particular, the state of affairs \\(\\langle \\Tr,f_s\\);\n\\(0\\rangle\\) cannot be in \\(s\\). (Actually, Barwise and Etchemendy say\nthat the proposition is expressible, but give up on what they call the\n\\(F\\)-closure of \\(s\\). But there is a core observation in common\nbetween these two points, and the details do not matter for our\npurposes here.) There is then a distinct situation \\(s' = s \\cup\n\\{\\langle \\Tr,f_s\\); \\(0\\rangle \\}\\), and the proposition \\(\\{s'\\);\n[\\(\\Tr,f_s\\); 0]\\(\\}\\) relative to this new situation\u2014this new\n\u2018context\u2019\u2014is true.\n\nThis idea clearly has a lot in common with the restriction on\nquantifier domains view. In particular, both approaches seek to show\nhow the domain of contents expressible in contexts can expand, to\naccount for the instability of the Liar sentence. For discussion of\nrelations between the situation-theoretic and quantifier domain\napproaches, see Glanzberg (2004a). Barwise and Etchemendy discuss\nrelations between their situation-based and a more traditional\napproach in 1987 (Ch. 11). For a detailed match-up between the Barwise\nand Etchemendy framework and a Burgean framework of indexed truth\npredicates, see Koons (1992).\n4.4.5 Issues for contextualism\n\nIt is a key challenge to contextualists to provide a full and\nwell-motivated account of the source and nature of the shift in\ncontext involved in the Liar, though of course, many contextualists\nbelieve they have met this challenge. In favor of the contextualist\napproach is that it takes the revenge phenomenon to be the basic\nproblem, and so is largely immune to the kinds of revenge issues that\naffect other approaches we have considered. But, it may be that there\nis another form of revenge which might be applied. To retain\nconsistency, contextualists must apply restrictions on quantifiers to\nsuch quantifiers as \u2018all contexts\u2019. To achieve this, it\nmust presumably be denied that there are any absolutely unrestricted\nquantifiers. Glanzberg (2004b, 2006) argues this is the correct\nconclusion, but it is highly controversial. For a survey of thinking\nabout this, see the papers in Rayo and Uzquiano 2006.\n4.5 The revision theory\n\nAnother approach to the Liar, advocated by Gupta (1982), Herzberger\n(1982), Gupta and Belnap (1993), and a number of others, is the\nrevision theory of truth. This approach shares some features\nwith the views we surveyed in\n \u00a74.3,\n in that it takes classical logic for granted. We also believe it has\nan affinity with the views discussed in\n \u00a74.4,\n as it rethinks some basic aspects of semantics. But it is a\ndistinctive approach. We will sketch some of the fundamentals of this\nview. For a discussion of the foundations of the revision theory, and\nits relations to contextualism, see L. Shapiro (2006). More details,\nand more references, may be found in the entry on\n the revision theory of truth.\n\nThe revision theory of truth starts with the idea that we may take the\nT-schema at face value. Indeed, Gupta and Belnap (1993) take up a\nsuggestion from Tarski (1944), that the instances of the T-schema can\nbe seen as partial definitions of truth; presumably with all the\ninstances together, for the right language or family of languages\nconstituting a complete definition. At the same time, the revision\ntheory holds fast to classical logic. Thus, we already know, we have\nthe Liar paradox for any language with enough expressive resources to\nproduce Liar sentences.\n\nIn response, the revision theory proposes a different way of\napproaching the semantic properties of the truth predicate. In keeping\nwith our practices here, we may begin with a classical model\n\\(\\mathcal{M}_0\\) for a language \\(\\mathcal{L}_0\\) without a truth\npredicate, and consider what happens when we add a truth predicate\n\\(\\Tr\\) to form the extended language \\(\\mathcal{L}^{+}_0\\). This\nlanguage has a full self-applicative truth predicate, and so can\ngenerate the Liar sentence \\(L\\).\n\nTo build a classical model for \\(\\mathcal{L}^{+}_0\\), we need an\nextension for \\(\\Tr\\). Let us pick a set: call it \\(H\\) for a\nhypothesis about what the extension of \\(\\Tr\\) might be.\n\\(H\\) may be \\(\\varnothing\\), it may be the entire domain of\n\\(\\mathcal{M}_0\\), or it may be anything else. It need not be a\nparticularly good approximation of the semantic properties of\n\\(\\Tr\\).\n\nEven if it is not, \\(\\langle \\mathcal{M}_0,H\\rangle\\) still provides a\nclassical model, in which we can interpret \\(\\mathcal{L}^{+}_0\\). With\nthat, we can in effect apply the T-schema, relative to our hypothesis\n\\(H\\), and see what we get. More precisely, we can let \\(\\tau(H) =\n\\{\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner | A\\) is true in \\(\\langle\n\\mathcal{M}_0,H\\rangle \\}. \\tau(H)\\) is generally a better hypothesis\nabout what is true in our language than \\(H\\) might have been. At\nleast, clearly, if \\(H\\) made foolish guesses about the truth of\nsentence of the truth-free fragment \\(\\mathcal{L}_0\\), they are\ncorrected in \\(\\tau(H)\\), which contains everything from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_0\\) true in \\(\\mathcal{M}_0\\). Thus, \\(\\langle\n\\mathcal{M}_0,\\tau(H)\\rangle\\) is generally a better model of\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{+}_0\\) then \\(\\langle \\mathcal{M}_0,H\\rangle\\).\n\nBetter in many respects. But when it comes to paradoxical sentences\nlike \\(L\\), we see something different. As a starting hypothesis, let\nus consider \\(H = \\varnothing\\). Consider what happens to the truth of\n\\(L\\) as we apply \\(\\tau\\):\n\n\n\\(n\\)\ntruth value of \\(L\\) in \\(\\langle \\mathcal{M}_0,\\tau^n\n(\\varnothing)\\rangle\\) \n\n0\ntrue \n\n1\nfalse \n\n2\ntrue \n\n3\nfalse \n\n4\ntrue \n\n\\(\\vdots\\) \n\\(\\vdots\\)  \n\n\nThe Liar sentence never stabilizes under this process. We reach an\nalternation of truth values which will go on for ever. This shows,\naccording the revision theory, that truth is a circular concept. As\nsuch, it does not have an extension in the ordinary sense. Rather, it\nhas a rule for revising extensions, which never stabilizes.\n\nIn the terminology of the revision theory, \\(\\tau\\) is a revision\nrule. It takes us from one hypothesis about the interpretation of\n\\(\\Tr\\) to another. Sequences of values we generate by such revision\nrules, starting with a given initial hypothesis, are revision\nsequences. We leave to a more full presentation the important\nissue of the right way to define transfinite revision\nsequences. (See the entry on\n revision theories of truth.)\n\nThe characteristic property of paradoxical sentences like the Liar\nsentence is that they are unstable in revision sequences: there is no\npoint in the sequence at which they reach a stable truth value. This\nclassifies sentences as stably true, stably false, and unstable. The\nrevision theory develops notions of consequence based on these, and\nrelated notions. See the entry on\n revision theories of truth\n for further exposition of this rich theory.\n4.6 Inconsistency views\n\nIn\n \u00a72.3.3\n we saw that the Liar paradox, in the presence of unrestricted capture\nand release and classical logic, leads to contradiction. So long as we\nhave EFQ (as classical logic does), this results in triviality. Most\nof the proposed solutions we have considered (with the exception of\nthe revision theory) try to avoid this result somehow, either by\nrestricting capture and release or departing from classical logic. But\nthere is another idea that has occasionally been argued, that the Liar\nparadox simply shows that the kinds of languages we speak, which\ncontain their own truth predicates, are inconsistent.\n\nThis is not an easy view to formulate. Though Tarski himself seemed to\nsuggest something along these lines (for natural languages,\nspecifically), it was argued by Herzberger (1967) that it is\nimpossible to have an inconsistent language.\n\nIn contrast, Eklund (2002) takes seriously the idea that our semantic\nintuitions, expressed, for instance, by unrestricted capture and\nrelease, really are inconsistent. Eklund grants that this does not\nmake sense if these intuitions have their source simply in our grasp\nof the truth conditions of sentences. But he suggests an alternative\npicture of semantic competence which does make sense of it (closely\nrelated to conceptual role views of meaning). He suggests that we\nthink of semantic competence in terms of a range of principles\nspeakers are disposed to accept in virtue of knowing a language. Those\nprinciples may be inconsistent. But even so, they determine semantic\nvalues. Semantic values will be whatever comes closest to satisfying\nthe principles\u2014whatever makes them maximally correct\u2014even\nif nothing can satisfy all of them due to an underlying\ninconsistency.\n\nEklund thus supports an idea suggested by Chihara (1979).\nChihara\u2019s main aim is to provide what he calls a\ndiagnosis of the paradox, which should explain why the\nparadox arises and why it appears compelling. But along the way, he\nsuggests that the source of the paradox is our acceptance of the\nT-schema (by convention, he suggests), in spite of its\ninconsistency.\n\nA related, though distinct, view is defended by Patterson (2007,\n2009). Patterson argues that competence with a language puts one in a\ncognitive state relating to an inconsistent theory\u2014one including\nthe unrestricted T-schema and governed by classical logic. He goes on\nto explore how such a cognitive state could allow us to successfully\ncommunicate, in spite of relating us to a false theory.\n\nA different sort of inconsistency theory is advocated by Scharp\n(2013). Scharp argues that truth is an inconsistent concept, like the\npre-relativistic concept of mass. As such, it is unsuitable for\ncareful theorizing. What we need to do, according to Scharp, is\nreplace the inconsistent concept of truth with a family of consistent\nconcepts that work better. Scharp develops just such a family of\nconcepts, and offers a theory of them.\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nThere is much more to say about the Liar paradox than we have covered\nhere: there are more approaches to the Liar variants we have\nmentioned, and more related paradoxes like those of denotation,\nproperties, etc. There are also more important technical results, and\nmore important philosophical implications and applications. Our goal\nhere has been to be more suggestive than exhaustive, and we hope to\nhave given the reader an indication of what the Liar paradox is, and\nwhat its consequences might be.",
