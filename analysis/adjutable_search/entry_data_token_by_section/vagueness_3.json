    "main_text": "Many-valued Logic\n4. Many-valued Logic\n\nAn early favorite was many-valued logic. On this approach, borderline\nstatements are assigned truth-values that lie between full truth and\nfull falsehood. Some logicians favor three truth-values, others prefer\nfour or five. The most popular approach is to use an infinite number\nof truth-values represented by the real numbers between 0 (for full\nfalsehood) and 1 (for full truth). This infinite spectrum of\ntruth-values might be of service for a continuous sorites argument\ninvolving \u2018small real number\u2019 (Weber and Colyvan 2010).\nClassical logic does not enforce a sharp boundary for infinite\ndomains. But it still enforces unlimited sensitivity for vague\npredicates. If two quantities \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are growing but \\(A\\) is\ngiven a headstart, then \\(A\\) will cease to equal a small real number\nbefore \\(B\\). Since this transitional difference holds regardless of\nthe lead\u2019s magnitude, \u201c\\(A\\) equals a small real\nnumber\u201d passes from true to false within an arbitrarily narrow\ninterval. If the number of truth-values is instead as numerous as the\nreal numbers, there is no longer any mismatch between the tiny size of\nthe transition and the large difference in truth-value.\n\nThere is a new mismatch, however. The number of truth-values now\ndwarfs the number of truth-value bearers. Since a natural language can\nexpress any proposition, the number of propositions equals the number\nof sentences. The number of sentences is \\(\\aleph_0\\) while (assuming\nthe continuum hypothesis) the number of real numbers is at least\n\\(\\aleph_1\\). Consequently, there are infinitely many truth-values\nwithout bearers.\n\nThis new mismatch seems more bearable than the old mismatch it is\ndesigned to avoid. Yet some find even a lower infinity of truth-values\nover-bearing. Instead of having just one artificially sharp line\nbetween the true and the false, the many-valued logician has\ninfinitely many sharp lines such as that between statements with a\ntruth of .323483925 and those with a higher truth-value. Mark\nSainsbury grimaces, \u2018\u2026 you do not improve a bad idea by\niterating it\u2019 (1996, 255).\n\nA proponent of an infinite-valued logic might cheer up Sainsbury with\nan analogy. It is a bad idea to model a circle with a straight line.\nUsing two lines is not much better, nor is there is much improvement\nusing a three-sided polygon (a triangle). But as we add more straight\nlines to the polygon (square, pentagon, hexagon, and so on) we make\nprogress\u2014by iterating the bad idea of modeling a circle with\nstraight lines.\n\nIndeed, it would be tempting to triumphantly conclude \u201cThe\ncircle has been modeled as an infinite-sided polygon\u201d. But has\nthe circle been revealed to be an infinite-sided polygon? Have curved\nlines been replaced by straight lines? Have curved lines (and hence\ncircles) been proven to not exist? A model can succeed without being\nclear what has been achieved.\n\nBut it is premature to dwell on the analogy \u201cPrecision is to\nvagueness as straightness is to curvature\u201d. The many-valued\nlogician must first vindicate the comparison by providing details\nabout how to calculate the truth-values of vague statements from the\ntruth-values of their component statements.\n\nProponents of many-valued logic approach this obligation with great\nindustry. Precise new rules are introduced to calculate the\ntruth-values of compound statements that contain statements with\nintermediate truth-values. For instance, the revised rule for\nconjunctions assigns the conjunction the same truth-value as the\nconjunct with the lowest truth-value. These rules are designed to\nyield all standard theorems when all the truth-values are 1 and 0. In\nthis sense, classical logic is a limiting case of many-valued logic.\nClassical logic is agreed to work fine in the area for which it was\ndesigned\u2014mathematics.\n\nMost theorems of standard logic break down when intermediate\ntruth-values are involved. (An irregular minority, such as \u2018If\n\\(P\\), then \\(P\\)\u2019, survive.) Even the classical contradiction\n\u2018Donald is bald and it is not the case that he is bald\u2019\nreceives a truth-value of .5 when \u2018Donald is bald\u2019 has a\ntruth-value of .5. Many-valued logicians note that the error they are\nimputing to classical logic is often so small that classical logic can\nstill be fruitfully applied. But they insist that the sorites paradox\nillustrates how tiny errors accumulate into a big error.\n\nCritics of the many-valued approach complain that it botches phenomena\nsuch as hedging. If I regard you as a borderline case of \u2018tall\nman\u2019, I cannot sincerely assert that you are tall and I cannot\nsincerely assert that you are of average height. But I can assert the\nhedged claim \u2018Either you are tall or of average height\u2019.\nThe many-valued rule for disjunction is to assign the whole statement\nthe truth-value of its highest disjunct. Normally, the added disjunct\nin a hedged claim is not more plausible than the other disjuncts. Thus\nit cannot increase the degree of truth. Disappointingly, the proponent\nof many-valued logic cannot trace the increase of assertibility to an\nincrease in the degree of truth.\n\nEpistemicists ascribe the increase in assertibility to the increasing\nprobability of truth. Since the addition of disjuncts can raise\nprobability indefinitely, the epistemicists correctly predict that we\ncan hedge our way to full assertibility. However, epistemicists do not\nhave a monopoly on this prediction.\n",
