    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nStebbing lived through some remarkably turbulent decades, in terms\nboth of social and political upheavals and of philosophical\ndevelopments, and these are reflected in the direction and development\nof her work. Her personal life and career, in contrast, were\nrelatively uneventful. She was born in 1885 in North London, the\nyoungest of six surviving children of a fish merchant. She went up to\nGirton College Cambridge in 1904, a time at which University study for\nwomen was very much the exception and long before Cambridge awarded\ndegrees or even full University membership to women. Apparently her\nfirst interest was to study science, but this was deemed by her family\nto be too demanding for her on the grounds of her delicate health, so\nshe matriculated in History. Whether or not it was a legitimate bar to\nscientific study, it is true that Stebbing suffered from ill health\nthroughout her life. In particular, she was afflicted with\nMeni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, a disorder of the inner ear which\ncaused her fits of vertigo, severe headaches, and forced prolonged\nperiods of bed rest.\n\nWhile at Cambridge Stebbing developed an interest in philosophy,\napparently after happening on a copy of F. H. Bradley\u2019s\nAppearance and Reality (1893). After completing her studies\nin History she took the first part of the Moral Sciences Tripos at\nCambridge and then moved to King\u2019s College London to take an MA\nin Moral Science, graduating in 1912. After various short-term and\npart-time posts teaching in schools and universities, she was\nappointed to a lectureship at Bedford College for women, in the\nUniversity of London, in 1920. In 1933 she made the national\nnewspapers when she became the first woman in the UK to be appointed\nto a full professorship in philosophy, again at Bedford College.\n(Bedford College became coeducational in the 1960s but was merged with\nRoyal Holloway College in 1985, though the philosophers there moved to\nKing\u2019s College London, which now has an established chair of\nphilosophy named after her.) During the late 1930s and early 1940s she\nknew, or worked or corresponded with, many of the major figures in\nmid-twentieth century philosophy. At the same time she devoted a great\ndeal of time, influence, and personal income, to securing the safety\nof refugees from Germany and Nazi occupied countries: both exiled\nscholars and orphaned or fugitive children. However, her health\ncontinued to deteriorate. She suffered and apparently recovered from\none bout of cancer, but the cancer returned, and she died in 1943 at\nthe age of 57.\n\nStebbing\u2019s given names were \u201cLizzie Susan\u201d. She\ndisliked the \u201cLizzie\u201d and was universally known throughout\nher life as \u201cSusan\u201d. In her writing and professional work,\nshe generally preferred to use just initials, and at least to begin\nwith, she published as \u201cL. S. Stebbing\u201d. One friend\nsuggested that Stebbing preferred philosophical debates not to become\nside-tracked by details of gender or status that might be indicated by\nfirst names or titles. (For a full account of her life, see Chapman\n2013.)\n",
