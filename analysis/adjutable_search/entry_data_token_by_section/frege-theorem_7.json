Thus, the following captures the main features of\nFrege\u2019s definition of membership in Gg I,\n\u00a734:[2]\n\n\\(x\\in y \\eqdef \\exists G (y\\eqclose \\epsilon G \\amp Gx)\\) \n\nIn other words, \\(x\\) is an element of \\(y\\) just in case \\(x\\) falls\nunder a concept of which \\(y\\) is the extension. For example, given\nthis definition, one can prove that John is a member of the extension\nof the concept being happy (formally: \\(j \\in \\epsilon H)\\)\nfrom the premise that John falls under the concept being\nhappy (\u2018\\(Hj\\)\u2019). Here is a simple proof: \n\n\n1. \\(~ Hj\\)\nPremise\n\n2. \\(~ \\epsilon H = \\epsilon H\\)\nInstance of axiom \\(x=x\\)\n\n3. \\(~ \\epsilon H\\eqclose \\epsilon H \\amp Hj\\)\nfrom 1,2, by &-Introduction \n\n4. \\(\\exists G (\\epsilon H\\eqclose \\epsilon G \\amp Gj)\\)\nfrom 3, by Existential\nIntroduction\n\n5. \\(~ j \\in \\epsilon H\\)\nfrom 4, by definition of \\(\\in\\)\n\n\nSome readers may wish to examine a somewhat more complex example, in\nwhich the above definition of membership is used to prove that 1 \\(\\in\n\\epsilon[\\lambda x \\, x+2^2 = 5]\\) given the premise that \\( 1+2^{2} =\n5\\).\n (A More Complex Example)\n\nBefore we turn to Basic Law V, it is important to mention an important\nfact about our representation of Frege\u2019s system, in which\nwe\u2019ve introduced the term-forming operator \\(\\epsilon\\) into\nsecond-order logic with identity. The resulting system has the\nfollowing principle, which asserts that every concept has an\nextension, as a theorem:\n\nExistence of Extensions:\n\n\\(\\forall G\\exists x(x = \\epsilon G)\\) \n\nTo see that this is derivable given our work thus far, recall line 2\nof the proof in the above example: the laws of identity allow us to\nassert that:\n\n\\(\\epsilon F = \\epsilon F\\) \n\nIn second-order logic with identity, this is an instance of \\(x = x\\)\n(strictly speaking, one first derives \\(\\forall x(x = x)\\) from the\naxiom \\(x = x\\) by GEN, and then instantiates the universally\nquantified variable \\(x\\) to \\(\\epsilon F\\)). So, by existential\ngeneralization, it follows that:\n\n\\(\\exists x(x = \\epsilon F)\\) \n\nBut now the Existence of Extensions principle follows by universal\ngeneralization on the concept variable \\(F\\). Thus, simply by adding a\nterm-forming operator such as \\(\\epsilon\\) to classical logic with\nidentity, it is provable that every concept gets correlated with an\nextension. Basic Law V will not only imply, but also place a condition\non, this correlation.\n",
