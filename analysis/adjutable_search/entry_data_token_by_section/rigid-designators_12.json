As Hughes says, the position \u201cthat proper names are rigid,\nand that identity statements involving only proper names are\naccordingly necessarily true or necessarily false,\u201d is \u201cas\nclose to uncontroversial as any interesting views in analytic\nphilosophy\u201d (2004, p. vii). \n\nStill, in saying that rigidity is widely favored, we should be\nprepared to qualify in view of those I\u2019ve called \u201cserious\ncounterpart theorists,\u201d who must adopt a revisionist\nunderstanding of what it is for a designator to designate\n\u201crigidly\u201d (or alternatively, they can just frame their\nposition as a rejection of rigidity: e.g., Varzi 2003, already\nquoted). Usually, counterpart theorists are motivated by objections to\nsome of the necessity that rigidity secures, according to the usual\nunderstanding. It appears to some (e.g., Gibbard 1975) that not all\nidentity statements containing just names are necessarily true.\nConsider this scenario: you mold one chunk of clay into the top half\nof a statue, and another chunk of clay into the bottom half. You stick\nthe halves together, thus bringing into existence both a statue, call\nit \u2018David\u2019, and a large lump of clay, call it\n\u2018Lumpl\u2019. Suppose, next, that you explode the statue: both\nDavid and Lumpl go out of existence. It is tempting to say that\n\u2018David = Lumpl\u2019 is true, but not necessarily true. It\ncould have been that: David exists and Lumpl exists but \u2018David\n\u2260 Lumpl\u2019 is true. This would have been the case had Lumpl\nsurvived David: e.g., had you squeezed the clay statue into a ball,\nthereby changing the shape of the relevant lump of clay, instead of\nexploding it, thereby bringing an end to the lump of clay.\n\nIf both \u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 are rigid\ndesignators, then \u2018David = Lumpl\u2019 is necessarily true\nif it is true in any possible world at all. So, if it is even possible\nthat David \u2260 Lumpl, then David \u2260 Lumpl. David and Lumpl are\ndistinct, however intimately related, because they have different\nmodal properties: Lumpl could instantiate ballhood, while David could\nnot. The rigidity of \u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019\nevidently requires as much. In order to say that \u2018David =\nLumpl\u2019 is contingently true, Gibbard gives up the thesis that\n\u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 are rigid designators in\nthe usual respect. He maintains that designators are\n\u201crigid,\u201d very loosely speaking, only with respect to a\nsortal: \u2018David\u2019 is statue-rigid, always referring to the\nsame statue, while \u2018Lumpl\u2019 is lump-rigid, always referring\nto the same lump. Accordingly, \u2018Possibly, David is no\nstatue\u2019 is false, while \u2018Possibly, Lumpl is no\nstatue\u2019 is true. What about the object that is, as a\nmatter of fact, both a statue and a lump? For Gibbard, objects have no\nmodal properties and it makes no sense to say that an object in some\nother possible world is identical to an object in the actual world.\nThis is counterintuitive, but again Gibbard does offer a non-standard\nsemantics to accommodate modal talk.\n\nDavid Lewis (1986, chap 4) offers a similar strategy for maintaining\nthat \u2018Possibly, David is no statue\u2019 is false, while\n\u2018Possibly, Lumpl is no statue\u2019 is true. For Lewis, what\nmakes a sentence like the above true or false is whether counterparts\nin other possible worlds associated with \u2018David\u2019 or\n\u2018Lumpl\u2019 are all statues. The use, in discourse, of\ndifferent names like \u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 can\ncreate different contexts, thus altering the counterparts that come\ninto play in determining the truth of sentences containing the names.\nThe sentences \u2018Possibly, David is no statue\u2019 and\n\u2018Possibly, Lumpl is no statue\u2019 can vary in truth value\nbecause the counterparts relevant to the truth value of the former\nsentence are all statues but the counterparts relevant to the truth\nvalue of the latter sentence are not.\n\nOrthodox rigidity proponents who distinguish between the referents of\n\u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 say that there is more\nthan one object at the same place and time where the statue stands.\nThe intimate relationship between David and Lumpl is usually\nunderstood as one of constitution: David is constituted by\nLumpl. Constitution has been championed by various philosophers to\naddress a variety of related issues (see, e.g., Baker 2000 on personal\nidentity).\n\nAnother possibility, which avoids commitment to constitution, is to\nmaintain an eliminativism about statues or clay lumps. One might\nmaintain that there is no real entity to name \u201cDavid,\u201d in\nthe way that the story above requires; there is only Lumpl in a\nstatuesque form. Accordingly, the problem of accounting for the modal\nstatus of a sentence to which \u2018David\u2019 contributes, like\n\u2018David = Lumpl\u2019, never arises. (For an appeal to\neliminativism to handle various candidates for constitution, see Fitch\n2001, pp. 382\u20133, 391n.5; Hershenov 2005; Merricks 2001.) In\norder to work as a general alternative approach, eliminativism would\nhave to work for all of a wide variety of would-be cases of\nconstitution.\n\nNotice that the unintuitive idea that more than one object can exist\nin the same place at the same time is not necessarily removed if we\naccept contingent identity. Gibbard, for example, acknowledges that\nLumpl and David are distinct objects in any world w in which\nDavid but not Lumpl comes to an end by being squeezed into a ball; but\ndespite the failure of identity to hold between David and Lumpl in\nw, the two share one spatiotemporal location before\nDavid is destroyed because the material of the clay lump that is Lumpl\nis precisely the material of David.\n\nA good collection of papers on this topic is Rea (1997), and a\ngood introduction is his \u201cIntroduction.\u201d\n",
