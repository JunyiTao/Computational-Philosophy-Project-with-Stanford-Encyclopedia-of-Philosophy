The Egoism vs. Altruism Debate in Psychology\n\nThe psychological literature relevant to the egoism vs.\naltruism debate is\n vast;[13]\n in the interests of a tolerable brevity, the entry will focus on the\nwork of Daniel Batson and his associates, who have done some of the\nmost influential and philosophically sophisticated work in this\narea.\n\nBatson, along with many other researchers, begins by borrowing an idea\nthat has deep roots in philosophical discussions of altruism. Though\nthe details and the terminology differ significantly from author to\nauthor, the core idea is that altruism is often the product of an\nemotional response to the distress of another person. Aquinas\n(1270 [1917]: II\u2013II, 30, 3), for example, maintains that \n\n\nmercy is the heartfelt sympathy for another\u2019s distress,\nimpelling us to succour him if we can. \n\n\nAnd Adam Smith (1759 [1853]: I, I, 1. 1) tells us that \n\n\npity or compassion [is] the emotion we feel for the misery of others,\nwhen we either see it, or are made to conceive it in a very lively\nmanner \n\n\nand these emotions \n\n\ninterest [man] in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness\nnecessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the\npleasure of seeing it.\n\n\nBatson (1991: 58) labels this response \u201cempathy\u201d which he\ncharacterizes as \u201can other-oriented emotional reaction to seeing\nsomeone suffer\u201d, and calls the traditional idea that empathy\nleads to altruism the empathy-altruism hypothesis. On\nBatson\u2019s account (1991: 86), empathy \n\n\nincludes feeling sympathetic, compassionate, warm, softhearted,\ntender, and the like, and according to the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis, it evokes altruistic motivation \n\n\nthough that motivation does not always lead to behavior. Batson (1991:\n117) contrasts empathy with a cluster of affective responses he calls\n\u201cpersonal distress\u201d which is \u201cmade up of more\nself-oriented feelings such as upset, alarm, anxiety, and\n distress\u201d.[14]\n\nIf the philosophical tradition that suggests the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis is on the right track, and Batson believes it is, one would\npredict that when people feel empathy they will desire to help those\nwho evoke the emotion, and thus be more inclined to engage in helping\nbehavior than people who do not feel empathy. This does not mean that\npeople will always engage in helping behavior when they feel\nempathy, since people may often have conflicting desires, and not all\nconflicts are resolved in favor of empathy\u2019s urgings. Nor does\nit mean that when people feel little or no empathy they will not\nengage in helping behavior, since the desire to help can also be\nproduced by a variety of processes in which empathy plays no role. But\nwe should expect that typically people feeling empathy will be more\nlikely to help than people who aren\u2019t feeling empathy, and the\nstronger their feelings of empathy the more likely it is that they\nwill engage in helping behavior.\n\nIn order to put this claim to empirical test, it is important to have\nways of inducing empathy in the laboratory, and there is a substantial\nbody of literature suggesting how this can be done. For example,\nStotland (1969) showed that subjects who were instructed to\nimagine how a specified person (often called \u201cthe\ntarget\u201d) felt when undergoing what subjects believed to\nbe a painful medical procedure reported stronger feelings of empathy\nand showed greater physiological arousal than subjects who were\ninstructed to watch the target person\u2019s\n movements.[15]\n Relatedly, Krebs (1975) demonstrated that subjects \nwho observe someone similar to themselves \nundergo painful experiences show more physiological\narousal, report identifying with the target more strongly, and report\nfeeling worse while waiting for the painful stimulus to begin than do\nsubjects who observe the same painful experiences administered to\nsomeone who is not similar to themselves. Krebs also showed that\nsubjects are more willing to help at some personal cost when the\nsufferer is similar to themselves. Batson (1991: 82\u201387) interprets\nthese findings as indicating that people are more inclined to feel\nempathy for those they believe to be similar to themselves, and thus\nthat empathy can often be induced by providing a person with evidence\nthat she and a target person are similar.\n\nTo make the case that empathy leads to helping behavior, Batson relies\nin part on work by others, including the just-cited Krebs (1975) study\nand a study by Dovidio et al. (1990). In that latter study,\nStotland\u2019s technique for manipulating empathy by instructing\nsubjects to take the perspective of the person in distress was used to\ninduce empathy for a young woman. Subjects focused on one of two quite\ndifferent problems that the young woman faced. When given an\nopportunity to help the young woman, subjects in whom empathy had been\nevoked were more likely to help than subjects in a low empathy\ncondition, and the increase in helping was specific to the problem\nthat had evoked the empathy.\n\nMany of Batson\u2019s own experiments, some of which are\ndescribed below, also support the contention that both spontaneously\nevoked empathy and empathy engendering experimental manipulations\nincrease the likelihood of helping behavior. Another important source\nof support for the link between empathy and helping behavior is a\nmeta-analysis of a large body of experimental literature by Eisenberg\nand Miller (1987) which found positive correlations between empathy\nand prosocial behavior in studies using a variety of techniques to\nassess empathy. On the basis of these and other findings, Batson\n(1991: 95) argues that \n\n\nthere is indeed an empathy-helping relationship; feeling empathy for a\nperson in need increases the likelihood of helping to relieve that\nneed.\n\n\nIt might be thought that establishing a causal link between empathy\nand helping behavior would be bad news for egoism. But, as Batson\nmakes clear, the fact that empathy leads to helping behavior does not\nresolve the dispute between egoism and altruism, since it does not\naddress the nature of the motivation for the helping behavior\nthat empathy evokes. One possibility is that empathy does indeed cause\na genuinely altruistic desire to help\u2014an ultimate desire for the\nwell-being of the sufferer. But there are also a variety of egoistic\nroutes by which empathy might lead to helping behavior. Perhaps the\nmost obvious of these is that empathy might simply be (or cause) an\nunpleasant experience, and that people are motivated to help because\nthey believe this is the best way to stop the unpleasant\nexperience that is caused by someone else\u2019s distress.\n\nQuite a different family of egoistic possibilities focus on the\nrewards to be expected for helping and/or the punishments to be\nexpected for withholding assistance. If people believe that others\nwill reward or sanction them for helping or failing to help in certain\ncircumstances, and that the feeling of empathy marks those cases in\nwhich social sanctions or rewards are most likely, then we would\nexpect people to be more helpful when they feel empathy, even if their\nultimate motivation is purely egoistic. A variation on this theme\nfocuses on rewards or punishments that are self-administered. If\npeople believe that helping may make them feel good, or that failing\nto help may make them feel bad, and that these feelings will be most\nlikely to occur in cases where they feel empathy, then once again we\nwould expect people who empathize to be more helpful, though their\nmotives may be not at all altruistic.\n\nDuring the last four decades, Batson and his collaborators have\nsystematically explored these egoistic hypotheses and many others.\nTheir strategy is to design experiments in which the altruistic\nexplanation of the link between empathy and helping can be compared to\none or another specific egoistic explanation. Reviewing all of these\nexperiments would require a far longer\n entry.[16]\n Instead the focus will be on two clusters of experiments that\nillustrate the potential philosophical rewards of designing and\ninterpreting experiments in this area, as well as some difficulties\nwith the project.\n",
