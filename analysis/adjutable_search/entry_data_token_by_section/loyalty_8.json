    "main_text": "The structure of loyalty || The objects of loyalty\n3.5 The objects of loyalty\n\nAs noted, the primary objects of loyalty tend to be persons, personal\ncollectivities (such as families), or quasi-persons such as\norganizations (the company for which one works) or social groups\n(one\u2019s church congregation). Some argue that it is only to such\nthat we can be loyal (Ladd, 1967; Baron, 1984). But that is at odds\nwith the view that almost \u201canything to which one\u2019s heart\ncan become attached or devoted\u201d may also become an object of\nloyalty\u2014principles, causes, brands, ideas, ideals, and\nideologies (Konvitz, 1973, 108). Royce himself argued that loyalty is\nthe \u201cwilling and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a\nperson to a cause\u201d (Royce, 1908, 16\u201317). In response,\nthose who personalize the objects of loyalty point out that we have\nequally available to us the language of commitment or devotion and, in\nthe case of what is spoken of as \u201cloyalty to one\u2019s\nprinciples,\u201d we have the language of integrity.\n\nThere is some reason to favor the more restrictive focus for loyalty.\nOur core loyalties, which also happen to be those that are\npsychologically more powerful (Walzer, 1970, 5), tend to secure the\nviability and sometimes the integrity of our particular human\nassociations. To the extent that our moral obligations encompass not\nonly our relations with other human beings in general but also our\nrelationships with particular others\u2014our friends, families,\nfellow citizens, and so on\u2014loyalty will be partially\nconstitutive and sustaining of these particular others in contexts in\nwhich narrow or short-term self-interest is likely to be better served\nby abandoning them. If we further argue that the core of morality is\nconcerned with the quality of relationships that people have with each\nother, both as fellow humans and in the various associative groups\nthat they form, then loyalty will constitute an important dimension of\nthat relational network. Even the \u201ccause\u201d with which Royce\nassociates loyalty is ultimately articulated in terms of devotion to a\ncommunity (Royce, 1908, 20; 1913, vol. 1, xvii). Although the\nobject of loyalty is another individual or association, not a cause,\nvalue, or ideal, there is, nevertheless, an important connection\nbetween our loyalties to individuals and groups, and the causes,\nvalues, and ideals to which we subscribe. In identifying with the\nobject of our loyalty, there is usually implicit in our\nloyalty a judgment that its object meshes with that for which we\nstand. That is, embedded in those associations to which our loyalty is\ngiven are certain presumptions about the compatibility of the basic\nvalues attributable to the object of loyalty with those to which we\nare committed (not that the values themselves are what ground the\nloyalty, for that might suggest that the loyalty is to the values). To\nthe extent that we discover it to be otherwise we have a reason for\ntaking some action\u2014either to try to bring about a change in the\nobject of our loyalty (what Albert Hirschman [1970] calls giving\nvoice) or to abandon it (Hirschman\u2019s exit option) on the ground\nthat it has forfeited its claim to our loyalty. There may, of course,\nbe some sort of persistence of loyalty despite a recognition that the\nobject of loyalty is no longer worthy of it. In such cases, the\nloyalty seems to ride on some commitment to an associational ideal\n(\u201cHe will always be our son.\u201d).\n\n\nIn theory, nothing prevents the \u201cpersonal\u201d object of\nloyalty being the whole human race (pace Ladd, 1967). A\nuniversalist particularism can be found in some environmental\ncontexts, when the future of humanity is up for consideration,\nor\u2014as it was nicely illustrated in Mary Shelley\u2019s\nFrankenstein\u2014when Victor Frankenstein decided not to\njeopardize the human race by creating a companion for his monster\n(Shelley, 1831 [1957, 187]). In contexts in which the human race can itself\nbe viewed as a collectivity, loyalty to it may be\nattributed\u2014though that may sometimes generate charges of\nspeciesism (Bernstein, 1991).\n",
