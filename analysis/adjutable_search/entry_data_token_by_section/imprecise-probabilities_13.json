You have no idea how likely they\nare, but they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Then you acquire\nsome evidence \\(E\\). Some simple probability\ntheory shows that for every \\(p\\in P\\) we have\nthe following relationship (using \\(p_i = p(E\\mid\nH_i)\\) for \\(i=1,2\\)).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(H_1\\mid E) & = {{p(E\\mid H_1)p(H_1)} \\over {p_1 p(H_1) +p_2\np(H_2)}} \\\\ & = {{p_1 p(H_1)} \\over {p_2 + (p_1 - p_2) p(H_1)}}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nIf your prior in \\(H_1\\) is vacuous\u2014if \\(P(H_1) =\n[0,1]\\)\u2014then the above equation shows that your posterior is\nvacuous as well. That is, if \\(p(H_1) = 0\\) then \\(p(H_1\\mid E) =\n0\\) and likewise for \\(p(H_1) = 1 = p(H_1\\mid E)\\), and since the\nright hand side of the above equation is a continuous function of\n\\(p(H_1)\\), for every \\(r\\in [0,1]\\) there is some \\(p(H_1)\\) such\nthat \\(p(H_1\\mid E) = r\\). So \\(P(H_1\\mid E)=[0,1]\\).\nIt seems like the imprecise probabilist cannot learn from vacuous\npriors. This problem of belief inertia goes back at least as far as\nLevi (1980), chapter 13.\nWalley also discusses the issue, but appears unmoved by it: \nhe says that vacuous posterior probabilities are just a\nconsequence of adopting a vacuous prior:\n\nThe vacuous previsions really are rather trivial models. That seems\nappropriate for models of \u201ccomplete ignorance\u201d which is a\nrather trivial state of uncertainty. On the other hand, one cannot\nexpect such models to be very useful in practical problems,\nnotwithstanding their theoretical importance. If the vacuous\nprevisions are used to model prior beliefs about a statistical\nparameter for instance, they give rise to vacuous posterior\nprevisions\u2026 However, prior previsions that are close to vacuous\nand make nearly minimal claims about prior beliefs can lead to\nreasonable posterior previsions. (Walley 1991:\n93)\n\nJoyce (2011)\nand Rinard (2013) have both discussed\nthis problem. Rinard\u2019s solution to it is to argue that this shows that\nthe vacuous prior is never a legitimate state of belief. Or rather,\nthat we only ever need to model your beliefs using non-vacuous priors,\neven if these are incomplete descriptions of your belief state. This\nis similar to Walley\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive\u201d representation of\nbelief. \nVallinder (2018) suggests that the problem of belief inertia is quite a general one.\nCastro and Hart (forthcoming) use the looming danger of belief inertia to argue against what I have called an \"objectivist\" interpretation of IP.\n\nAn alternative solution to this\nproblem, (inspired by Wilson 2001; and Cattaneo\n2008; 2014), would modify the update rule in such a way that\nthose extreme priors that give extremely small likelihoods to the\nevidence are excised from the representor. More work would need to be\ndone to make this precise and show how exactly the response would\ngo.\n",
