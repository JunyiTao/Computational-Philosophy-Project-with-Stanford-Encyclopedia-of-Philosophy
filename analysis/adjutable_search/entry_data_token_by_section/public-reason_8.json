    "main_text": "Content\n4. Content\n\nThe debate over the constituency of public reason has direct\nimplications regarding public reason\u2019s content. The greater the\ndegree to which the constituency of public reason is idealized, the\nmore we are restricting the content of public reason, that is, the\npool of ideas or arguments that could be reasonably endorsed by the\nmembers of the relevant constituency. And if the content of public\nreason is restricted in this way, it may be possible to determine\nwhich rules or principles are conclusively publicly justified via\nphilosophical analysis, without recourse to any actual deliberations\namongst citizens. Conversely, the less idealized our account of public\nreason\u2019s constituency, the more the content of public reason\nwill be determined by some actual process of deliberation between\nagents in the real world, or at least more realistic idealizations of\nsuch agents.\n\nOn Rawls\u2019s view, the content of public reason has two parts\n(Rawls 1996, 224). The first part consists of the principles of a\npolitical conception of justice. Although Rawls accepts that citizens\ncan and will reasonably disagree about the specific content of this\nconception, he claims that this disagreement will be limited to a\n\u201cfamily\u201d of liberal political conceptions, all of which\nshare the following features: (1) a list of basic rights, liberties,\nand opportunities; (2) an assignment of special priority to these\nrights, liberties, and opportunities, especially when compared with\npolicies aimed at the general good or perfectionist values; and (3)\nmeasures ensuring all citizens have adequate all-purpose means to make\nuse of their freedoms (Rawls 1996, 223; Rawls 1999b, 581\u2013582).\nConceptions of justice, to be political, must apply to society\u2019s\nbasic social and political institutions, must be able to be presented\nindependently of any particular view of the good life, and must be\nworked out by appeal to ideas implicit in the public political culture\nof a constitutional democracy (Rawls 1999b, 584). Thus, for Rawls,\nsome of the paradigmatic examples of the political values of justice\nand public reason would include: the idea of equal basic liberties;\nthe idea of equality of opportunity; and principles concerning a just\ndistribution of income and wealth (Rawls 1999b, 584). The second part\nof public reason, at least as presented by Rawls in Political\nLiberalism, are guidelines of inquiry which include principles of\nreasoning and rules of evidence to determine how substantive\nprinciples are to be applied, as well as important civic virtues such\nas reasonableness and civility (Rawls 1996, 224). Together, these two\ncomponents provide both the normative content and the guidelines for\ncitizens when engaged in public reason with one another about\nfundamental political matters.\n\nThose who adopt a more inclusive view of the constituency of public\nreason object that the normative content of public reason cannot be as\ndeterminate as Rawls suggests (e.g. Benhabib 2002, 108\u2013112; Gaus\n2011, 36\u201346; Habermas 1995, 126\u2013131). On Habermas\u2019s\nview, for example, the normative content of public reason is not\nsomething that is determined via philosophical analysis or argument.\nRather, philosophy provides a set of ideal rules or guidelines for the\nconduct of public reasoning. The ideal guidelines for public reasoning\nwould ensure that the discussion is inclusive, public, and free from\nany internal or external coercion, that anyone may raise a point that\nthey believe is relevant to the topic at hand, that any participant is\nallowed to challenge the rules for agenda setting, and that discussion\ncontinues until a consensus is reached (Habermas 1996, 304\u2013305).\nBut on this account, the philosopher \u201cleaves substantial\nquestions that must be answered here and now to the more or less\nenlightened engagement of participants, which does not mean that\nphilosophers may not also participate in the public debate, though in\nthe role of intellectuals, not of experts\u201d (Habermas 1995, 131).\nIn a similar vein, Gaus suggests that without making controversial\nassumptions, or else idealizing the constituency of public reason in a\nway that excludes too much of the diversity to which public reason is\nmeant to be the solution, the normative content of public reason is\nlargely indeterminate, that is, many different possible rules can be\njustified as better than anarchy, but no philosophical argument or\nanalysis can establish a determinate set of rules as being uniquely\ncapable of meeting the test of public reason (Gaus 2011, 43\u201344).\nOn his account, the content of public reason is given determinate\ncontent not by philosophical argument, nor necessarily by deliberation\namongst real citizens, but rather via a path-dependent evolutionary\nprocess, whereby stable norms evolve and are selected by virtue of\ntheir capacity to make cooperative life possible.\n\nAlthough much of the debate regarding public reason\u2019s content\nhas focused on the question of normative content, there are also\nimportant questions about the other aspect of public reason\u2019s\ncontent\u2014what Rawls describes as the guidelines of inquiry. Rawls\nsuggests that these guidelines of inquiry direct citizens to abstain\nfrom appealing to \u201ccomprehensive religious or philosophical\ndoctrines\u2014to what we as individuals or members of associations\nsee as the whole truth\u2014nor to elaborate economic theories of\ngeneral equilibrium, say, if these are in dispute\u201d. Instead he\nsuggests citizens must rely on \u201cplain truths now widely\naccepted, or available, to citizens generally,\u201d which include\nthe conclusions of science when not controversial (Rawls 1996,\n224\u2013225). One interesting issue is how testimony from scientists\nand other experts is to be incorporated into the guidelines of inquiry\n(see Donahue 2020). There is at least one other puzzling aspect\nof this proposal. As Rawls concedes, one of the things that reasonable\npeople disagree about is the nature of truth itself. There are\ncompeting philosophical theories of truth, and public reason is meant\nto abstain from appealing to particular philosophical doctrines. Rawls\nthus famously suggests that his account of political liberalism, of\nwhich the idea of public reason is a central part, \u201cdoes without\nthe concept of truth\u201d (Rawls 1996, 94). But without a concept of\ntruth, how can we make sense of what Rawls says about the guidelines\nof inquiry, in particular his claim that citizens should rely on\n\u201cplain truths now widely accepted\u201d? Some argue that Rawls\nis mistaken, and political philosophy cannot abstain from at least\nsome controversial claims about the nature of truth (Estlund 1998; Raz\n1990). Others accept that political philosophy must abstain from\ncontroversial philosophical theories of truth, but insist that public\nreason requires a \u201cpolitical\u201d (as opposed to\nphilosophical) account of the truth (Cohen 2008).
