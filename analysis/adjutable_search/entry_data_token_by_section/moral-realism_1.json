    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n2. Metaphysics\n\n\nPutting aside the arguments that appeal to moral disagreement, a\nsignificant motivation for anti-realism about morality is found in worries\nabout the metaphysics of moral realism and especially worries about whether\nmoral realism might be reconciled with (what has come to be called)\nnaturalism. It is hard, to say the least, to define naturalism in a\nclear way. Yet the underlying idea is fairly easy to convey. According\nto naturalism, the only facts we should believe in are those\ncountenanced by, or at least compatible with, the results of science.\nTo find, of some putative fact, that its existence is neither\nestablished by, nor even compatible with science, is to discover, as\nnaturalism would have it, that there is no such fact. If moral realism\nrequires facts that are incompatible with science (as many think it\ndoes) that alone would constitute a formidable argument against it.\n\n\nNoncognitivists and error theorists alike have no trouble respecting\nnaturalism while offering their respective accounts of moral claims. In\nboth cases, their accounts appeal to nothing not already embraced by\nnaturalism. Of course noncognitivists and error theories disagree in\ncrucial ways about the nature of moral thought, and noncognitivists and\nerror theorists disagree among themselves too about which versions of\ntheir preferred accounts are better. But they all are, from the point\nof view of naturalism, on safe ground.\n\n\nMoral realists, in contrast, are standardly seen as unable to\nsustain their accounts without appealing, in the end, to putative facts\nthat fly in the face of naturalism. This standard view can be traced to\na powerful and influential argument offered by G.E. Moore (1903). As\nMoore saw things, being a naturalist about morality required thinking\nthat moral terms could be defined correctly using terms that refer to\nnatural properties. Thus one might define \u2018good\u2019 as\n\u2018pleasant\u2019, thus securing naturalistic credentials for\nvalue (so long as pleasure was a natural property) or one might define\n\u2018good\u2019 as \u2018satisfies a desire we desire to\nhave\u2019 or as \u2018conforms to the rules in force in our\nsociety\u2019 or \u2018promotes the species.\u2019 Any one of these\nproposed definitions, if true, would establish that the facts required\nto make claims about what is good true or false were compatible with\nnaturalism. Yet, Moore argued, no such definition is true.\nAgainst every one, he maintain, a single line of argument was decisive.\nFor in each case, whatever naturalistic definition of moral terms was\non offer, it always made sense to ask, of things that had the\nnaturalistic property in question, whether those things were (really)\ngood.\n\n\nConsider someone who held not merely that pleasure was something good\nbut (as a definition would have it) that pleasure was\ngoodness\u2014that they were one and the same property. According to\nthat person, in claiming that something is pleasant one is claiming\nthat it is good, and vice versa. In that case, though, it\nwould not make sense for people to acknowledge that something is\npleasant and then wonder, nonetheless, whether it was good. That would\nbe like acknowledging that something is a triangle and then wondering,\nnonetheless, whether it has three sides. Yet, Moore maintained, the\ntwo cases are not alike. A person who wonders whether a triangle has\nthree sides shows he does not understand what it is to be a\ntriangle. His competence with the terms in question is revealed to be\ninadequate. In contrast, Moore observed, for any natural property\nwhatsoever it was always an open question whether things that had that\nnatural property were good.  A person who raised that question did not\nthereby reveal himself not to be competent with the terms in\nquestion. What this shows, Moore argued, was that moral terms did not\nrefer to natural properties and so a proper account of moral claims\nwould have to recognize that they purport to report non-natural\nfacts.\n\n\nNow of course moral realists can consistently acknowledge this and\nthen argue against naturalism\u2014perhaps, at least in part, on the\ngrounds that naturalism is incompatible with acknowledging moral facts. This\nwas, in fact, Moore\u2019s position. Yet one then has the burden of\nexplaining how moral facts are related to natural facts and the burden\nof explaining how we might manage to learn of these non-natural facts.\nA good deal of the work that has been done defending moral realism is\ndevoted either to meeting these burdens or to showing that they do not\npose a special problem just for morality. Moral realists of this sort\nallow that moral facts are not natural facts, and moral knowledge is\nnot simply of a piece with scientific knowledge, even as they defend\nthe idea that there are moral facts and (at least in principle) moral\nknowledge. They thus reject the idea that science is the measure and\ntest of all things (Shafer-Landau 2003, Parfit 2011, Scanlon 2014).\n\n\nImpressed by the plausibility of naturalism, though, many moral\nrealists have tried, in one way or another, to show that the moral\nfacts they are committed to are either themselves natural facts or are\nat least appropriately compatible with such facts (Boyd 1988, Brink\n1989, Railton 1986). If they are right, then naturalism poses no\nspecial threat to moral realism.\n \n\nFor a long time, people thought that Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument (as it has come to be called) established that no version of\nmoral naturalism was defensible. However, recent developments in the\nphilosophy of language and metaphysics have raised concerns about\nMoore\u2019s argument. Of special concern is the fact that the\nargument seems to rule out inappropriately the possibility of\nestablishing\u2014on grounds other than semantic analysis\u2014that\ntwo terms actually refer to the same property, substance, or\nentity.\n\n\nThe problem becomes clear if one thinks of, for instance, the claim\nthat water is H2O. That water is H2O cannot be\ndiscovered simply by appreciating the meanings of the terms involved,\nso if a person were to wonder of some water whether it is really\nH2O he would not thereby be revealing some incompetence\nwith the terms in question. His question would be, in the relevant\nway, an Open Question, even if, in fact, water is\nH2O. Similarly, some moral realists argue that value might,\nin fact, be properly identified with, say, what satisfies desires we\ndesire to have (to take one proposal Moore considered) even though\nthis cannot be discovered simply by appreciating the meanings of the\nterms involved. As a result, a person might intelligibly wonder\nwhether something that satisfied a desire she desired to have was\nactually good. The question might be, in the relevant way, an Open\nQuestion, even if, in fact, value is whatever satisfies a desire we\ndesire to have. Of course the point here is not that one or another\nsuch proposal is true, but that the openness of the Open Question is\nnot good grounds for supposing such proposals could not be true.\n\n\nPursing a different response to Moore's Open Question Argument, others\nhave defended the possibility of a successful semantic analysis\nreducing moral claims to claims expressible in entirely naturalistic\nterms (Jackson 1998, Finlay 2014). Accordingly, they argue that the\nopenness Moore points to, such as it is, is compatible with a correct\nsemantic analysis\u2014albeit not obvious\u2014showing that\nmoral facts are nothing over and above natural facts. \n\n\nOnce the Open Question is sidelined as being, at least, not\ndecisive, room is left for thinking a correct account of the moral\nfacts might identify them as natural facts. Just which facts those\nmight be, and what arguments one might offer for one account rather\nthan another, remains open, but the idea that we can know ahead of time\nthat there are no good arguments for such an account is no longer\nwidely accepted.\n",
