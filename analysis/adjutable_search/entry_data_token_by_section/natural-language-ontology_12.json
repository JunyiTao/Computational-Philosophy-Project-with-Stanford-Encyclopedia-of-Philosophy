    "main_text": "The Issue of Ontologies || The Ontology of Natural Language and the Core-Periphery Distinction\n4.1 The Ontology of Natural Language and the Core-Periphery Distinction\n\nNot only metaphysical assertions are generally set aside when pursuing\nnatural language ontology. Philosophers when clarifying metaphysical\nintuitions make use only of certain sorts of expressions (or uses of\nexpressions) and not others, and so for a linguist interested in the\nontology of natural language. Certainly, they will not appeal to\ntechnical philosophical expressions or uses of expressions, that is,\n(uses of) expressions meant to convey philosophical notions arrived at\nby reflection, whether by philosophers or non-philosophers (the\n\u201cfolk\u201d). It is a characteristic feature of natural\nlanguage to allow for expansion, permitting at least certain\ntypes of expressions to be used with a particular intended meaning and\nto allow conveying new concepts through the formation of new\nexpressions, by means of morphological processes or syntactic\ncomposition. These are entirely legitimate ways of using language, but\nthey are generally set aside when philosophers appeal to language as a\nway of clarifying metaphysical intuitions. For example, Heidegger\nintroduced the nominalization das Nichts \u201cthe\nnothing\u201d as well as the verb nichten \u201cto\nnothing\u201d. While this is not an illegitimate use of language, no\nphilosopher or linguist would take the existence of the nominalization\nor the verb to be evidence for there to be an entity that is a nothing\nor a corresponding process or state. Likewise, the possibility of\nforming, legitimately, the term the truth value true is\ncertainly never taken as evidence for truth values being entities.\nAnother example is the various meanings philosophers associate with\nthe noun existence. The fact that there are different notions\nof existence that different philosophers endorse and associate as the\nmeaning of the noun existence does not mean that the ontology\nof natural language reflects those notions all at once. As was\nmentioned in\n Section 2.2.4,\n not all expressions allow for \u201cnon-ordinary\u201d or\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d uses in that way. Expressions that belong\nto the functional part of grammar generally do not, such as\nauxiliaries (have, be, can, may), determiners, and\nquantifiers, and neither does the verb exist\n (\u00a71.3).\n\nPhilosophers and non-philosophers when engaging in ontological\nreflection may use or introduce expressions specifically meant to\nconvey their own ontological views. But such (uses of) expressions are\nnever considered indicative of the ontology implicit in natural\nlanguage. Yet they should come with a semantics as well, and may have\nto be assigned as semantic values entities or properties, even if\nfictional, in order to be integrated within a single compositional\nsemantics of the language. Still a distinction needs to be maintained,\nin some way, between what is implicitly accepted as part of our\nlinguistically manifest intuitions (non-technical expressions with\ntheir ordinary meaning) and what is added on through reflection.\n\nThe different ways in which the two sorts of linguistic data are\ntreated, by both philosophers and by linguists, motivate a distinction\nbetween the (ontological) core of natural language (or the\nuse of it) and its (ontological) periphery (Moltmann 2020c):\nonly the core, not the periphery, reflects our metaphysical intuitions\nand thus the ontology of natural language. Clearly, without a\ncore-periphery distinction, any ontological view or notion, as\nreflected in particular technical (uses) of terms, would be part of\nthe ontology of natural language. This would mean that the ontology of\nnatural language would no longer reflect metaphysical intuitions and\nwould comprise an unrestricted range of not generally mutually\ncompatible ontologies.\n\nThough the core-periphery distinction appears to have been tacitly\nmade throughout the history of philosophy as well as in the practice\nof contemporary semanticists, the task of making it precise faces\nconsiderable challenges. One challenge is to elaborate the distinction\ncontent-wise, say in terms of cognitive relations on the part of\nagents, distinguishing, in some way, between intuition or implicit\nacceptance and inferential or reflective acceptance (of part of the\nontology). A second challenge is to investigate whether the\ndistinction is grounded in the grammar of language. A plausible\nhypothesis to pursue is that it goes along with the divide between the\nfunctional part of language (which includes syncategorematic\nexpressions, syntactic categories and features, and auxiliary verbs)\nand the lexicon. The example of the contrast between\nexistence and exist suggests, though, that this may\nbe too simplified: the noun existence should belong to the\nperiphery (since it is able to convey just any notion of existence a\nparticular metaphysician has in mind), whereas the verb exist\nbelongs to the core, not permitting a non-ordinary use.\n\nThe question also arises whether and how the distinction relates to\nthe core-periphery distinction that Chomsky (1981, 1986) introduced\nfor syntax, where, very roughly, the core of the syntactic system of a\nlanguage represents universal grammar and the periphery exceptions and\noutside influences.\n\nNote that \u201cperiphery\u201d is not meant to mean\n\u201cmarginal\u201d in the sense of statistically less used.\nMoreover, it does not concern the kind of ontology itself: the\nperiphery may contain a technical use of a term which ends up denoting\nthe very same category or entity as a term from the core. What\nmatters, rather, is language-users\u2019 cognitive relation to\nsemantic values, whether it involves some form of reflection or\nderivative acceptance rather than implicit acceptance.\n\nGiven the core-periphery distinction,\n (2)\n will need to be revised as follows:\n\n(11)\n The ontology of a natural language is the ontology a speaker\nimplicitly accepts by way of making use of the core of the\nlanguage.\n\n\nThe periphery by itself imposes challenges for natural language\nsemantics and natural language ontology. The periphery, from a\nlinguistic point of view at least, is a legitimate part of natural\nlanguage (or a legitimate extension of it): technical (uses) of terms\ncertainly have a semantics and will reflect an ontology, even if it is\nnot the ontology of natural language, but one that goes beyond it. It\nis part of the task of natural language semantics to in principle\nallow for the semantic composition of the meaning of sentences\ncontaining philosophical (uses) of terms.\n\nIt has been argued that there is one kind of complex expression that\ngenerally belongs to the periphery, and that is reifying NPs of the\nsort the number eight, the property of being happy, the\nproposition that it is raining, or the truth value true\n(Moltmann 2020c). It is a general observation that philosophers\nusually stay away from reifying NPs when drawing on natural language\nfor motivating an ontological category. For example, Frege (1884) did\nnot motivate numbers as objects by appealing to the construction\nthe number eight in natural language, and he did not motivate\ntruth values as objects by appealing to the truth value true.\nRather he used expressions from the core like the number of\nplanets and eight when arguing for numbers being\nobjects, and his motivations for considering truth values to be\nobjects did not come from particular natural language sentences at\nall. Likewise, Hale (1987) argued for properties being objects not on\nthe basis of terms like the property of mercy, but rather\nsimple terms like mercy from the core of language. Finally,\nLink (1979) motivated mereological sums being part of the ontology of\nlanguage not on the basis of terms like the sum of the\nstudents from the periphery of language, but rather simple\ndefinite plurals like the students. The semantics of reifying\nterms itself appears to be associated with abstraction involving the\nintroduction of an entity on the basis of a nonreferential (use of) an\nexpression (Moltmann 2013, chap. 6). If such an operation of object\nintroduction (a form of derivative acceptance) defines the content of\nreifying terms\n (\u00a73.1.3),\n their classification as part of the periphery may become\nplausible.\n\nThe core-periphery distinction in natural language ontology would be\nimportant also for the quest for universals of natural language\nontology. Only the core reflects metaphysical intuitions, which are\ngenerally held to not display interpersonal inconsistency (see entry\non\n intuition).\n This means that only the core, not the periphery can represent a form\nof universal language-related ontology. Of course, the general\npresupposition that intuitions show no interpersonal inconsistency may\nbe in error, and so may be the assumption that the ontology of the\ncore is universal rather than showing language-particular\ndifferences.\n\nWhile philosophers and linguists generally appear to adopt a\ncore-periphery distinction implicitly, the distinction appears\nexplicitly in a general hypothesis about reference to abstract objects\nin natural language that has been pursued in Moltmann (2013):\n\n(12)\n\n\nThe Abstract-Objects Hypothesis\n\nNatural language does not involve reference to abstract objects in its\ncore, but only in its periphery. \n\n\nThe Abstract-Object Hypothesis is a particular thesis within\nnatural language ontology; it is not a methodological principle of\nnatural language ontology as such. This means that natural language\nontology, with (or even without) its core-periphery distinction, may\nbe pursued while not subscribing to the Abstract-Objects\nHypothesis.\n\nThe Abstract-Objects Hypothesis goes against the widely held belief\nthat reference to abstract objects in natural language is rampant\n (\u00a71.6).\n Based on a range of semantic and syntactic generalizations, Moltmann\n(2013) argues that this view is mistaken: what appear to be\nexpressions in the core of natural language, referring to abstract\nobjects (numbers, properties, propositions, degrees, expression types)\nare in fact expressions referring to particulars, pluralities of\n(actual or possible) particulars, or variable objects, or else they\nare expressions that fail to have a referential function in the first\nplace (numerals, clausal complements, predicative complements,\ncomplements of intensional transitive verbs). The particulars comprise\ntropes, including quantitative tropes (John\u2019s height) and number\ntropes (the number of planets) (see entry on\n tropes).\n Only in the periphery, so the view, is reference to abstract objects\npossible, for example through the use of reifying terms such as\nthe number eight, the property of being happy,\nthe word \u201chappy\u201d, or the proposition that it\nis raining. Thus, the view is that in its core, the ontology of\nnatural language displays a form of trope nominalism (see entry on\n nominalism in metaphysics).\n",
