Civil rights encompassed the rights\nto own property, enter into legally binding contracts, receive due\nprocess of law, bring private lawsuits, testify in court, and worship\none\u2019s religion. They also covered freedom of speech and the\npress (Amar 1998: 216\u201317). But they were traditionally conceived\nas excluding the right to vote or to hold public office, which were\nassigned to an entirely separate category, that of political rights,\nand conferred by law only on (some) adult males. Social rights\nconcerned the domain of interactions deemed \u201cprivate,\u201d which\nencompassed not only personal relationships such as friendships but\ntransactions between businesses and their clientele.\n\nThe separation of civil from political and social rights was\ntraditionally invoked to limit the scope of citizenship rights so as\nto keep the members of certain social groups, notably women, blacks,\nand wage-workers, in their subordinate status. The claims of members\nof those groups to the franchise were denied with the assertion that,\neven though all citizens were entitled to civil rights, not all were\nentitled to political rights. The franchise was said to be, not a\nright, but rather a \u201cprivilege,\u201d properly conferred only on those who\nwere fit to exercise it in a way that would promote the good of\nsociety (Keyssar: 38 and 177). And the claims of blacks to be served\nby a business or to travel in a railroad car to which whites had\naccess were denied with the assertion that civil rights did not touch\nupon social matters such as the decisions of persons and businesses to\nassociate with the members of one race but not another. Such decisions\nwere said to be analogous to a person\u2019s choice of friends or\ndinner guests.\n\nIn the decades following the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled\nthat, as a matter of constitutional law, political rights were not\namong the rights held by all adult citizens and that Congress had no\nauthority to prohibit racial discrimination in access to the goods and\nservices of private firms that catered to the public. In Minor v.\nHappersett, the Court invoked the civil-political distinction in\nholding that, even though women were undoubtedly citizens, \u201cthe\nConstitution, when it conferred citizenship, did not necessarily\nconfer the right of suffrage\u201d (1874: 177). And in the Civil Rights\nCases, the Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875,\nwriting that the Constitution did not confer upon Congress the power\n\u201cto adjust what may be called the social rights of men and races in\nthe community, but only to declare and vindicate those fundamental\nrights which appertain to the essence of citizenship\u201d (1883: 22).\n\nAccordingly, the court used the civil-political-social distinction to\nformulate its conception of citizenship, and its conception licensed a\nhierarchical sorting of citizens by sex and race. The court\u2019s\nrulings and reasoning reflected the dominant views of race and sex in\nAmerican society at the time and for decades thereafter. Those views\ndid not go unchallenged, however. Challenges were mounted by the women\nin the suffrage movement and by blacks, who argued that access to the\nballot was needed for the effective enjoyment of the rights to\nproperty, contract and the other traditional civil rights. \n",
