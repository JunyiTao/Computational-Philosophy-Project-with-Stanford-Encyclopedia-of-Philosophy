    "main_text": "Laws, Circularity and Prospects for Explanation\n9. Laws, Circularity and Prospects for Explanation\n\nGoing back to Armstrong (1983, 40), there have been\nchallenges to those who hold a Humean account of laws, and about\nwhether Humean laws are explanatory. More recently, Maudlin has\nput the challenge in a perspicuous way:\n\n\nIf one is a Humean, then the Humean Mosaic itself appears to admit of\nno further explanation. Since it is the ontological bedrock in terms\nof which all other existent things are to be explicated, none of these\nfurther things can really account for the structure of the Mosaic\nitself. This complaint has been long voiced, commonly as an objection\nto any Humean account of laws. If the laws are nothing but generic\nfeatures of the Humean Mosaic, then there is a sense in which one\ncannot appeal to those very laws to explain the particular features of\nthe Mosaic itself: the laws are what they are in virtue of the Mosaic\nrather than vice versa (Maudlin 2007, 172).\n\n\nLoewer (2012, 131) offers a response to the issue\nthat Maudlin highlights. Loewer\u2019s response is that the\ngreat Humean mosaic makes the laws of nature true. The move he makes\nto avoid the circularity is that Humean laws do not\nmetaphysically explain elements of the mosaic, but they do\nscientifically explain aspects of the mosaic, suggesting that\nthere are two notions of explanation and so no circularity. This\nmove has spawned a recent slew of excellent journal articles regarding\nthe viability of Loewer\u2019s move (see especially Lange 2013,\nMiller 2015, Roski 2018, and Shumener 2017).\n\n\nAn increasingly popular way to look at the relation between laws and\ntheir instances is taking instances as grounding laws. No individual\ninstance of a law can fully ground the law, but a conjunction of\ninstances does more fully ground the law. Another plausible way of\nviewing the relation between laws and their instances is to see laws\nas grounding their instances (Emery 2019). Because the grounding\nrelation is non-symmetric, both of these views cannot be true. The way\nout of this dilemma is one that illuminates the debate about\nexplanation in an interesting way. Consider that while (P\n& Q) is a full ground for Q, it seems wrong to\nclaim that (P & Q) explains why Q\n(Roski 2018). This is because the content of the explanandum (what is\nto be explained) is embedded in the content of the explanans (what is\nintended to do the explaining), and something cannot explain itself\n(or be an essential part of an explanation of itself). Notice that\nthis formulation exposes the problem: if the explanans includes the\nexplanandum as part of its content, it makes the explanation devoid of\nunderstanding. Ones audience would have to already have had an\nunderstanding of the explanandum. Successful explanations are not\ncircular, so anyone taking laws as grounds for their instances ought\nnot to think that the grounding relation is explanatory. The point\nhere is not to show that grounding is not an explanatory relation, but\nrather to show that laws of nature are not suited to explain\ntheir instances. Circularity also infects the DN model of\nexplanations. As the authors of the DN model pointed out:\n\n\u2026 the content of the explanandum is contained in the\nexplanans. That is correct since the explanandum is a semantic\nconsequence of the explanans (Hempel and Oppenheim, cf. 1948, 162;\nalso see Shumener 2017, 793).\n\nThe issue here undermines the importance of the role for explanations\nto provide understanding. The required validity brings semantic\ncircularity, because the content of the explanans would then be\nsufficient for the truth of the explanandum. In line with the regular\npresentations of the DN model, at least one law of nature is required\nto be a premise in an \u201cexplanatory argument\u201d. Indeed, at\nleast one law needs to be essential to the validity of the argument,\nand the laws being part of the explanans are clearly a factor\nregarding the circularity. To add to these challenges, it is good\nto remember what Dretske pointed out regarding laws and\nexplanation.\n\n\nTo say that a law is a universal truth having explanatory power is\nlike saying a chair is a breath of air used to seat people. You cannot\nmake a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear, not even a very good\nsow\u2019s ear; and you cannot make a generalization, not even a\npurely universal generalization, explain its instances. The fact that\nevery F is G fails to explain why any F is G, and it fails to explain\nit, not because its explanatory efforts are too feeble to have\nattracted our attention, but because the explanatory attempt is never\neven made \u2026 Subsuming an instance under a universal\ngeneralization has exactly as much explanatory power as deriving Q\nfrom P & Q. None (1977, 26).\n\n\nDretske\u2019s reaction to this quotation was to conclude that\nlaws of nature are not universally quantified conditionals; that they\nare not mere generalizations. Instead, it was thought that laws\nhad to be a different kind of thing: a relation between universals,\nphysically necessary generalizations, or a true axiom or theorem of an\nideal system, or even a metaphysically necessary generalization. \nAnother approach needs to be considered, maybe, just maybe, laws of\nnature are generalizations and just aren\u2019t explanatory in any\nvery significant way. This is an approach that identifies what sort of\nentity a law of nature is.\n",
