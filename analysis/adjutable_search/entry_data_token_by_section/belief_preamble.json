    "main_text": "\n\nAnglophone philosophers of mind generally use the term\n\u201cbelief\u201d to refer to the attitude we have, roughly,\nwhenever we take something to be the case or regard it as true. To\nbelieve something, in this sense, needn\u2019t involve actively\nreflecting on it: Of the vast number of things ordinary adults\nbelieve, only a few can be at the fore of the mind at any single time.\nNor does the term \u201cbelief\u201d, in standard philosophical\nusage, imply any uncertainty or any extended reflection about the\nmatter in question (as it sometimes does in ordinary English usage).\nMany of the things we believe, in the relevant sense, are quite\nmundane: that we have heads, that it\u2019s the 21st century, that a\ncoffee mug is on the desk. Forming beliefs is thus one of the most\nbasic and important features of the mind, and the concept of belief\nplays a crucial role in both philosophy of mind and epistemology. The\n\u201cmind-body problem\u201d, for example, so central to philosophy\nof mind, is in part the question of whether and how a purely physical\norganism can have beliefs. Much of epistemology revolves around\nquestions about when and how our beliefs are justified or qualify as\nknowledge.\n\nMost contemporary philosophers characterize belief as a\n\u201cpropositional attitude\u201d. Propositions are generally taken\nto be whatever it is that sentences express (see the entry on\n propositions).\n For example, if two sentences mean the same thing (e.g., \u201csnow\nis white\u201d in English, \u201cSchnee ist weiss\u201d in German),\nthey express the same proposition, and if two sentences differ in\nmeaning, they express different propositions. (Here we are setting\naside some complications that might arise concerning indexicals; see\nthe entry on\n indexicals.)\n A propositional attitude, then, is the mental state of\nhaving some attitude, stance, take, or opinion about a proposition or\nabout the potential state of affairs in which that proposition is\ntrue\u2014a mental state of the sort canonically expressible in the\nform \u201cS A that P\u201d, where\nS picks out the individual possessing the mental state,\nA picks out the attitude, and P is a sentence\nexpressing a proposition. For example: Ahmed [the subject] hopes [the\nattitude] that Alpha Centauri hosts intelligent life [the\nproposition], or Yifeng [the subject] doubts [the attitude] that New\nYork City will exist in four hundred years. What one person doubts or\nhopes, another might fear, or believe, or desire, or\nintend\u2014different attitudes, all toward the same proposition.\nDiscussions of belief are often embedded in more general discussions\nof the propositional attitudes; and treatments of the propositional\nattitudes often take belief as the first and foremost example.\n",
