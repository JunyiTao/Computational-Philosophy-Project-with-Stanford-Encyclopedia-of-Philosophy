Partial Belief and Subjective Probability\n\nIn \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n According to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual\u2019s subjective degrees\nof confidence. First written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time\nof its publication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey\u2019s death),\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 was not very widely discussed\nuntil after the publication of Savage\u2019s The Foundations of\nStatistics (1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence.\nMany of the key ideas and arguments original to the essay have\nreappeared in later foundational works in the subjectivist tradition\n(e.g., de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section\noutlines some of Ramsey\u2019s major contributions to this tradition,\nfocusing primarily on the procedure he suggests for measuring\nsubjective probability.\n\nRamsey\u2019s central goal in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a \u2018logic of\npartial belief\u2019. That is, the laws specify necessary conditions\non any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a manner analogous to how\nthe laws of classical logic might be taken to generate necessary\nconditions on any consistent set of full beliefs. The argument for\nthis claim is grounded in Ramsey\u2019s subjectivist approach to\nprobability. The essay begins, however, with a discussion of the two\nmajor approaches to understanding probabilities at the time in\nCambridge: frequentism, and a version of the logical interpretation\nput forward by the economist John Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on\nProbability (1921).\n\nRegarding frequentism \u2013 according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials \u2013 Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey\u2019s\npurposes and relate not to the consistency of partial beliefs but to\ntheir reasonableness. (We\u2019ll return to the role of frequencies\nin Ramsey\u2019s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes\u2019 theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions \u2013 roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes\u2019 assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition \u2013 to which Ramsey\nobjects:\n\n\n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them\u2026 moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161)\n\n\nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n\u2018This is red\u2019 and \u2018That is blue\u2019), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n\u2018we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging\u2019 (1926a, [FM] 162).\n\nHaving dismissed Keynes\u2019 theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat:\n\n\n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169)\n\n\nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in \u2018Truth and\nProbability,\u2019 in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue:\n\n\nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken\u2019s behaviour\u2026 Thus any set\nof actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)\u2026 (1927a, [FM]\n144)\n\n\nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs \u2013 that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they\u2019re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices.\n\nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n\u2018the degree of a belief\u2026 has no precise meaning unless we\nspecify more exactly how it is to be measured\u2019 (1926a, [FM]\n167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a procedure\nfor the measurement of partial belief, which includes as an initial\npart also the measurement of desires (or \u2018utilities\u2019). The\nprocedure takes as input the subject\u2019s preferences over\n\nworlds, or more accurately propositions that are\nmaximally specific with respect to matters the subject cares about,\nand\ngambles, including especially binary gambles of the form\n\u2018world \\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\), and world \\(\\omega_2\\)\notherwise\u2019, and ternary gambles of the form \u2018\\(\\omega_1\\)\nif \\(p \\amp q\\), \\(\\omega_2\\) if \\(p \\amp \\neg{q}\\), and \\(\\omega_3\\)\notherwise\u2019.\n\n\nWith those as inputs, the procedure supplies precise numerical\nrepresentations of her partial beliefs and utilities provided the\nagents\u2019 preferences satisfy a number of \u2018coherence\u2019\nrequirements. The procedure can be roughly summarised as follows.\nFirst, we elicit the subject\u2019s preferences by offering her a\nsequence of choices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. Then, on\nthe assumption that the subject is an expected utility maximiser, we\ncan use her preferences to determine her numerical utilities. Given\nher utilities, we can finally define the subject\u2019s degree of\nbelief towards the proposition \\(p\\) in terms of her utilities for\ngambles conditional on \\(p\\). The following paragraphs will briefly\ndiscuss these three steps in turn. More thorough treatments of\nRamsey\u2019s procedure can be found in Sahlin 1990, Bradley 2001,\nand Elliott 2017; see also Neth 2019 for an extension of the Ramseyan\nprocedure beyond expected utility theory.\n\nRegarding the first step, which requires us to elicit the\nsubject\u2019s preferences, Ramsey says:\n\n\n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world\u2026 Suppose next that the subject is\ncapable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief in different\npropositions by making him offers of the following kind. Would you\nrather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world [\\(\\omega_2\\)]\nif \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is false? (1926a,\n[FM] 177)\n\n\nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they \u2018had the\npower of the Almighty\u2019, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158\u201360;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255\u20136; Bradley 2001, \u00a73.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). A measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn\u2019t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured \u2013 placing a cold\nthermometer into a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for\nexample, but for most purposes this effect is negligible. The\nobjection at hand is therefore that merely having the subject come\nto believe that they have some choice over these worlds and\ngambles will generally involve a substantial change to their\nbeliefs \u2013 enough to undermine the accuracy of Ramsey\u2019s\nprocedure. For example, the process might alter the subject\u2019s\nbeliefs regarding the claim \u2018Experimenters have the capacity to\nmake it the case that \\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and\n\\(\\omega_2\\) obtains otherwise\u2019, with potentially many ripple on\neffects through to her other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note\nof a similar problem for an alternative procedure (1926a, [FM] 170),\nthough does not discuss the worry as it arises for his own\nproposal.\n\nThe second step of Ramsey\u2019s procedure takes us from preferences\nto utilities. This step is the most complicated, and it requires a\nsuite of background assumptions about the partial beliefs, utilities,\nand preferences of the subject. In his words,\n\n\nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person\u2019s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions. (1926a,\n[FM] 174)\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s point here is that, given some background psychological\nassumptions, it will be possible \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 to\nspecify exactly what a subject\u2019s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey leaves the details of this \u2018general\npsychological theory\u2019 almost entirely implicit. We can clarify\nmatters on his behalf by breaking the theory into three parts:\n\nFirst, there exists a function \\(\\varphi\\) that associates gambles\nwith real numbers, such that the subject weakly prefers a gamble\n\\(\\gamma_1\\) to another gamble \\(\\gamma_2\\) just in case\n\\(\\varphi(\\gamma_1)\\geq\\varphi(\\gamma_2)\\)\nSecond, this function \\(\\varphi\\) \u2018decomposes\u2019 into\ntwo further real-valued functions \\(\\bel\\) and \\(des,\\) in the sense\nthat if \\(\\gamma\\) is the binary gamble \n\u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_2\\)\nif \\(\\neg{p}\\)\u2019 then\n\\(\\varphi(\\gamma) =\nbel(p){\\cdot}des(\\omega_1\\&{}p) +\n(1-bel(p)){\\cdot}des(\\omega_2\\&\\neg{}p)\\)\n(and likewise for ternary gambles, mutatis\n  mutandis)\nThird, \\(bel\\) and \\(des\\) represent the subject\u2019s\npartial beliefs and utilities respectively; for instance,\n\\(bel(p)\\geq\\bel(q)\\) just in case the subject\u2019s degree of\nbelief towards \\(p\\) is at least as great as their degree of belief\ntowards \\(q\\), and likewise \\(des(p)\\geq{}des(q)\\) just in case the\nsubject desires that \\(p\\) at least as much as they desire that\n\\(q\\)\n\n\nIn other words, Ramsey assumes that our preferences conform to the\nrule of expected utility maximisation, where the expected\nutility of a gamble is given by the weighted average of the utilities\nof its outcomes, the weights being provided by the subject\u2019s\ndegrees of belief. While Ramsey recognised that these assumptions\ninvolve some idealisation, he justifies them by noting that the\ndevelopment of any measurement process \u2018cannot be accomplished\nwithout introducing a certain amount of hypothesis or fiction\u2019\n(1926a, [FM] 168), and that the assumptions come close enough to the\ntruth to render them still useful (1926a, [FM] 173).\n\nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey\u2019s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas:\n\nEthical Neutrality: \\(p\\) is ethically\nneutral for a subject iff, for all worlds \\(\\omega\\) consistent\nwith \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is indifferent between\n\\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp \\neg{p}\\).\n\nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey uses it to construct a definition (in terms of preferences over\ngambles) for when the difference in utility between two\nworlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to the\ndifference in utility between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[2]\n This equal differences in utility definition provides Ramsey\nwith the resources needed to sketch a representation theorem,\nwhich constitutes the centrepiece of his paper. According to this\ntheorem, the subject\u2019s preferences over worlds and gambles will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions (or \u2018axioms\u2019)\nonly if there exists at least one function, \\(des\\), which represents\nthe subject\u2019s preferences over worlds in the sense that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) is weakly preferred to \\(\\omega_2\\) if and only if\n\\(des(\\omega_1) \\geq des(\\omega_2)\\). Moreover, this function will be \nunique up to positive linear transformations \u2013 that is, for any\nother function \\(des^*\\) with the same property, \\(des^*(x) =\ndes(x)r+c \\) (for some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\)).\nAs such, \\(des\\) is an interval scale representation:\na numerical scale in which intervals of differences are\nmeaningful. For instance, the difference in utility between\n\\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as that between\n\\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) just in case \\(des(\\omega_1) -\ndes(\\omega_2) \\geq des(\\omega_3) - des(\\omega_4) \\). (Other examples\nof interval scales include temperatures as measured in degrees Celsius\nor Fahrenheit, and yearly dates as measured in the A.D. and Buddhist\nor Hindu systems.) Given Ramsey\u2019s background \u2018general\npsychological theory\u2019, the implication is that the\nsubject\u2019s preferences will satisfy Ramsey\u2019s eight axioms\nonly if this function \\(des\\) represents her utilities on an interval\nscale.\n\nIncluded among Ramsey\u2019s eight axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive. But the\naxioms also include some less obvious conditions, for instance that\nfor any pair of worlds \\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there\u2019s a\nfurther world \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility is exactly halfway between\nthat of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\). There has been very little\nempirical investigation into Ramsey\u2019s axioms, primarily due to\nthe widespread opinion that his representation result has been\nsuperseded by the results of Savage (1954) and later decision\ntheorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981). However, Ramsey\u2019s\nassumption that there exists an ethically neutral proposition (needed\nfor the definition of equal differences in utility to make sense) has\nattracted substantial critical discussion. Ramsey does not discuss any\nreasons to believe that even one ethically neutral proposition exists,\nstill less that their existence is a precondition for the\nconsistency of partial beliefs. For more discussion,\nincluding on why ethically neutral propositions are problematic for\nRamsey\u2019s proposal and whether they\u2019re necessary for it,\nsee Sobel 1998, Bradley 2001, Eriksson & H\u00e1jek 2007, and\nElliott 2017. A further question concerns whether this stage of\nRamsey\u2019s procedure presupposes the controversial\n\u2018deliberation crowds out prediction\u2019 thesis, according to\nwhich an agent deliberating about an action cannot have meaningful\ndegrees of belief regarding whether she will perform that action; see\nLiu & Price (2020) for discussion and Rabinowicz (2002) for a\ncritique of the thesis.\n\nThe third and final stage of Ramsey\u2019s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject\u2019s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief:\n\n\nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [\u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise\u2019], we can define the subject\u2019s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179)\n\n\nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition follows from the\nbackground assumption of the \u2018general psychological\ntheory\u2019 mentioned above: the world \\(\\omega_2\\) has the same\nutility as the gamble \u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\)\notherwise\u2019 just in case \n\\[des(\\omega_2) = bel(p)des(\\omega_1) + (1 - bel(p))des(\\omega_3)\\]\n\n\nWhere \\(des(\\omega_1) \\neq des(\\omega_3)\\), this equality can be\nrearranged to give a definition of \\(bel(p)\\)as follows:\n\n\\[bel(p) = \\frac{des(\\omega_2) - des(\\omega_3)}{des(\\omega_1) - des(\\omega_3)}\\]\n\n\nAs Ramsey notes,\n\n\nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179\u201380)\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n\u2018laws of probability\u2019 follow: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n&bel(p) + bel(\\neg p) = 1\\\\\n &bel(p \\,|\\, q) + \\bel(\\neg p \\,|\\, q) = 1\\\\\n &bel(p \\amp q) = bel(p)bel(q \\,|\\, p)\\\\\n &bel(p \\amp q) + bel(p \\amp \\neg q) = bel(p)\\\\\n &bel(p \\,\\vee\\, q) = bel(p) + bel(q), \\text{where }p\\amp q\\text{ is impossible} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRamsey goes on to say:\n\n\nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options\u2026 (1926a, [FM] 182)\n\n\nIn this passage we find an early version of what has come to be known\nas a representation theorem argument for probabilistic norms\non partial belief and for expected utility theory, of the kind later\nmade popular by Savage. (See also Skyrms 1987, Hajek 2008, and the\nentry on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility,\n \u00a72.2, for discussion). It is dubious, however, that Ramsey\n\u2018proved\u2019 that the stated laws must be true of any\nconsistent set of partial beliefs, even where\n\u2018consistency\u2019 is understood as being tied to the\n\u2018laws of preference\u2019 in the manner that Ramsey suggests.\nAmong the axioms of his representation theorem are some (like those\nregarding the ethically neutral proposition) which are not plausible\nas conditions of the consistency on those preferences.\nFurthermore, Ramsey\u2019s \u2018proof\u2019 requires substantive\npsychological assumptions about the connection between partial beliefs\nand preferences, which Ramsey admits are idealizations. Even if those\nassumptions happen to be true as a matter of fact, though, or close to\nthe truth, they are presupposed in the derivation and require\nindependent justification.\n\nImmediately following, Ramsey also states that:\n\n\nIf anyone\u2019s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182)\n\n\nThe reasoning behind this claim is never made explicit, though it is\nevident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known as a\nDutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937; see\nthe entry on\n Dutch book arguments\n for details).\n\nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable (as opposed to just\nconsistent). He proposes a condition of calibration,\nor fit with known frequencies:\n\n\nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it\u2026 And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195)\n\n\nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\n Interpretations of Probability,\n \u00a73.3.4, for more discussion.\n\nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey\u2019s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993, Elliott 2021; for criticisms of the approach,\nsee Joyce 1999, \u00a71.3; Eriksson & H\u00e1jek 2007; Meacham\n& Weisberg 2011; Stef\u00e1nsson 2017.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology still today, the default or\northodox way to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of\nchoices, along essentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward.\n",
