    "main_text": "Species Permanence and Change in Antiquity || Classical Discussions\n1.1 Classical Discussions\n\nIn many respects, the general idea of species change in Western\nthought is an ancient concept. The reflections of Empedocles (ca.\n495\u201335 BCE) and the views of the Greek Atomists among the\nPresocratic nature philosophers formed a Classical heritage on which\nlater speculations could be developed (Kirby 2013). These Presocratic\nspeculations combined naturalistic accounts of origins with\nreflections on the workings of chance-like processes to create\nexisting forms of life (see the entry ancient atomism). Particularly\nas the Presocratic Atomist speculations were restated by the Roman\npoet Titus Lucretius (ca. 99\u201350 BCE) in book five of his On\nthe Nature of Things (Lucretius [RN]), a source was available in\nAntiquity and recovered in the Latin West in 1417. This set out a\nspeculative account of the gradual origin of living beings from an\ninitial atomic chaos. Through an undirected process, the best adapted\nforms are sorted out and those not suited to their conditions are\neliminated\n\nThe speculative accounts of the early atomists were, however, opposed\non several levels by the subsequent mainstream Platonic, Neo-Platonic,\nAristotelian, and Stoic philosophical traditions. The writings of\nPlato (427\u2013327 BCE), particularly his long creation myth,\nTimaeus\u2014 the only Platonic dialogue available\ncontinuously in the Latin Western tradition\u2014 provided an\ninfluential non-Biblical source for arguments against the Atomist\ntradition. This dialogue serves as the locus classicus for\nthe notion of an externally-imposed origin of living beings through\nthe action of an intelligent Craftsman (demiurgos) who orders\nmathematically- conceived matter into a rational cosmos that includes\nliving beings fashioned in accord with eternal archetypes or forms.\nPlato\u2019s account initiated the long tradition of reflection that\nwas continued in Neo-Platonism and in Greek and Roman Stoicism to form\nthe foundation of the argument that organic beings could not be\nexplained by chance-like processes either in their origins or in their\ncomplex design. Particularly as developed in the influential writings\nof the Greek physician Claudius Galenus (129\u2013200 CE), a long\nheritage in the life sciences relied upon anatomy as evidence of\nrational design. These interpretations of \u201cteleological\ndesign\u201d interacted in complex ways with Jewish, Christian, and\nIslamic Biblical concepts of creation (Sedley 2007). One common\nmeaning of \u201cteleology\u201d frequently encountered in\ndiscussions of evolution since Darwin\u2014that of externally imposed\ndesign by an intelligent agency (demiurge, nature, God) on\npre-existing matter\u2014originates in these ancient discussions and\nis not accurately identified with the Biblical concept of creatio\nex nihilo (Carroll 2015).\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s (384\u2013322 BCE) seminal biological writings,\nthe external teleology of a designer-creator was replaced by an\ninternal teleological purposiveness associated with the immanent\naction of an internal cause\u2014 in living beings their informing\nsoul (psuche)\u2014 which functioned as the formal, final\nand efficient cause of life (Aristotle, De Anima II: 415b,\n10\u2013 30 [1984]). Aristotle also did not endorse the concept of an\nhistorical origin of the world, affirming instead the eternity of the\nworld order (Physics, I: 192a, 25\u201334), which became the\nmain interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s views by a later tradition\n(Dales and Argerami 1991).\n\nAnother issue that Aristotle treated extensively with relevance to the\nconception of species\u2014embryogenesis\u2014also had important\nimplications for later discussions. In the traditions indebted in some\nway to Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy, sexual generation and the\nsubsequent embryological development of the individual from primordial\nmatter, is a sequential process that occurs in time under the\nteleological action of the soul (psuche). In\nAristotle\u2019s own account, this soul-as-form is typically derived\nfrom the male parent, but it could also be derived even from the sun,\nas employed in his explanation of the origin of\nspontaneously-generated forms (Aristotle, De generatione\nanimalium, III: 762a, 20\u201335).\n\nThis theory of the passing on of soul-as-substantial form in\ngeneration also formed the basis of one meaning of\n\u201cspecies\u201d (eidos) in Aristotle\u2019s biological\nworks. \u201cSpecies\u201d\nin this sense denotes the individualized en-mattered form-as-soul that\nis perpetuated in generation eternally. Although connected by a\ncomplex theory of mental abstraction to the universal in thought and\nlanguage, a biological species is not a universal, but an eternal\nserial sequence of one individual generating another individual\n(De Anima, II: 415b, 1\u201310). The importance of this\nmeaning of eidos as distinct from the concept of a universal\nin thought and language bears on several issues explored in Sections\n3.3 and 3.4 below. \n",
