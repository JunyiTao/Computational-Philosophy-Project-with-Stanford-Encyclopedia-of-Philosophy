    "main_text": "A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology || A Case Study\n1.1 A Case Study\n\nFor a glimpse of what Bayesian epistemology is, let\u2019s see what\nBayesians have to say about this episode in scientific inquiry:\n\n\nExample (Eddington\u2019s Observation).\nEinstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity entails that light can\nbe deflected by a massive body such as the Sun. This physical effect,\npredicted by Einstein in a 1911 paper, was observed during a solar\neclipse on May 29, 1919, from locations chosen from Eddington\u2019s\ntwo expeditions. This result surprised the physics community and was\ndeemed a significant confirmation of Einstein\u2019s theory.\n\n\n\nThe above case makes a general point:\n\n\nThe Principle of Hypothetico-Deductive\nConfirmation. Suppose that a scientist is testing a hypothesis\nH. She deduces from it an empirical consequence E, and\ndoes an experiment, being not sure whether E is true. It turns\nout that she obtains E as new evidence as a result of the\nexperiment. Then she ought to become more confident in H.\nMoreover, the more surprising the evidence E is, the higher the\ncredence in H ought to be raised.\n\n\n\nThis intuition about how credences ought to change can be vindicated\nin Bayesian epistemology by appeal to two norms. But before turning to\nthem, we need a setting. Divide the space of possibilities into four,\naccording to whether hypothesis H is true or false and whether\nevidence E is true or false. Since H logically implies\nE, there are only three distinct possibilities on the table,\nwhich are depicted as the three dots in\n figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A Space of Three\nPossibilities. [An\n extended description of figure 1.]\n\n\nThose possibilities are mutually exclusive in the sense that\nno two of them can hold together; and they are jointly\nexhaustive in the sense that at least one of them must hold. A\nperson can be more or less confident that a given possibility holds.\nSuppose that it makes sense to say of a person that she is, say, 80%\nconfident that a certain possibility holds. In this case, say that\nthis person\u2019s degree of belief, or credence, in that possibility\nis equal to 0.8. A credence might be any other real number. (How to\nmake sense of real-valued credences is a major topic for Bayesians, to\nbe discussed in\n \u00a71.6\n and\n \u00a71.7\n below.)\n\nNow I can sketch the two core norms in Bayesian epistemology.\nAccording to the first norm, called Probabilism, one\u2019s\ncredences in the three possibilities in\n figure 1\n ought to fit together so nicely that they are non-negative and sum to\n1. Such a distribution of credences can be represented by a bar chart,\nas depicted on the left of\n figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Conditionalization on\nEvidence. [An\n extended description of figure 2.]\n\n\nNow, suppose that a person with this credence distribution receives\nE as new evidence. It seems that as a result, there should be\nsome change in credences. But how should they change? According to the\nsecond norm, called the Principle of Conditionalization, the\npossibility incompatible with E (i.e., the rightmost\npossibility) should have its credence dropped down to 0, and to\nsatisfy Probabilism, the remaining credences should be scaled\nup\u2014rescaled to sum to 1. So this person\u2019s credence in\nhypothesis H has to rise in a way such as that depicted in\n figure 2.\n \n\nMoreover, suppose that new evidence E is very surprising. It\nmeans that the person starts out being highly confident in the falsity\nof E, as depicted on the left of\n figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Conditionalization on\nSurprising Evidence. [An\n extended description of figure 3.]\n\n\nThen conditionalization on E requires a total credence collapse\nfollowed by a dramatic scaling-up of the other credences. In\nparticular, the credence in H is raised significantly, unless\nit is zero to begin with. This vindicates the intuition reported in\nthe case of Eddington\u2019s Observation.\n\n",
