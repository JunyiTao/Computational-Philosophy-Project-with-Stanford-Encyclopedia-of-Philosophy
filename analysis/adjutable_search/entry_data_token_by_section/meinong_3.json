    "main_text": "Some Epistemology Matters\n3. Some Epistemology Matters\n\nEpistemology has a double fact as its object: the known fact and the\nfact of knowing. Knowing is judging an objective (state of affairs,\nsee below 4.3.1) with entitlement [Berechtigung] \u2013 both\nexternal and internal (1915, Chapt. IV). The external entitlement is\nprovided by the truth or truth-conduciveness of the judged objective,\nthe internal by evidence [Evidenz]. Evidence is not just a\nsubjective feeling of conviction; it is an objective feature of the\nmental act component of judging (with or without certainty) and not of\nits mental content component. (For the difference between the act and\ncontent components of an experience see 4.1 below and the supplement\non\n Presentation of Objects via Psychological Content.)\n Following Brentano, Meinong stands up for a concept of evidence as a\nbasis for the theory of knowledge. Meinong, for instance, accepts\nBrentano\u2019s views on evidence as they pertain to the\n\u201cdirect\u2013indirect\u201d and \u201ca\npriori\u2013a posteriori\u201d distinctions. On the\none hand, direct evidence may be given as a borderline case in inner\nperception, in which case it is evidence a posteriori (1906,\n\u00a7\u00a79\u201313: 47\u201368; \u00a726: 111: \u201cThe\nevidence of inner perception, like that of memory, is mere conjectural\nevidence that only reaches the limit of certainty at the present\nlimit.\u201d [\u201cDie Evidenz der inneren Wahrnehmung ist,\ngleich der des Ged\u00e4chtnisses, blo\u00dfe Vermutungsevidenz, die\nnur an der Gegenw\u00e4rtigkeitsgrenze die Gewi\u00dfheitsgrenze\nerreicht.\u201d]). On the other hand, it may be given as\nknowledge of axiomatic truths, which is evidence a priori\n(1906, \u00a71; 1915, \u00a755).\n\nLike Brentano, Meinong also thinks that perceiving and remembering are\nalways cases of judging and not just representing (1915: 606\u20137,\n613) and that a judgement is indirectly evident if it is concluded\nfrom directly evident judgements. On the other hand, Meinong deviates\nin certain respects from Brentano\u2019s theory of evidence. Already\nin 1886, Meinong adds \u201cevidence for presumption\u201d\n[Vermutungsevidenz] to \u201cevidence for certainty\u201d.\nHe realizes that we trust in memory, outer perception, and induction\nnot \u201cblindly and thoughtlessly\u201d or by chance, although our\ntrust in these abilities does not derive from anything else. It has an\ninternal justification, which is directly given and neither derived\nfrom the a posteriori evidence of inner perception nor from the a\npriori evidence of axioms. In delivering a kind of inference to the\nbest explanation, Meinong concludes that this confidence can be\ncounted as a further source of knowledge. It manifests itself as\ndirect evidence, but evidence for something that may be erroneous, not\ncertain, and he therefore calls it \u201cdirect conjectural\nevidence\u201d ([unmittelbare Vermutungsevidenz],\n1886: 30\u201334). Brentano, who only accepted \u201cevidence for\ncertainty\u201d, strongly disapproved of Meinong\u2019s conception.\nHe considered Meinong\u2019s introduction of a new special mode of\ncognition to be a cutting rather than an unravelling of the Gordian\nknot (Kindinger 1965, 22\u20133). \u2013 Actually this disagreement\nwas the beginning of the estrangement between them.\n\nAs Meinong takes objectives as ideal objects, he gives up\nBrentano\u2019s definition of truth by means of evidence. Brentano\nrejects the correspondence theory of truth, on the grounds that (among\nother things) he does not see anything in reality that would\ncorrespond to true negative judgements such as \u201cthere are no\nunicorns\u201d and defines truth of judgements by their evidence\n(Brentano 1930: 139 [82]); see entries on Brentano\nand Brentano\u2019s Theory of Judgement). Meinong adopts a\nkind of identity theory of truth, which can be seen as a borderline\ncase of a correspondence theory (Meinong 1915, \u00a77; 1910,\n\u00a713; see below 5.6). According to Meinong, the true negative\njudgement \u201cthere are no unicorns\u201d has a subsistent\nobjective as its corresponding object (the fact of the non-being of\nunicorns). If the objective in question does not subsist (has\nnon-being) the judgement is false. However, though Meinong does not\nuse the notion of evidence for a definition of truth, he holds it\nstill relevant for a truth criterion because truth is a\n\u201cproprium\u201d of evidence (1915: 463), and evidence for\ncertainty (and for presumption, respectively) makes truth (and\nprobability, respectively) accessible to us. (A classical criticism of\nMeinong\u2019s theory of evidence is Nelson 1908: 479\u2013485.)\n\nMeinong\u2019s epistemology turned out to be relevant to analytic\ntheory of knowledge. Some of Chisholm\u2019s (1966: 38\u201355)\nrules of evidence, for example, are a kind of application of\nMeinong\u2019s conception of direct evidence for conjecture. Further,\nMeinong\u2019s treatment of epistemic concepts like truth or\nentitlement as value concepts anticipates the epistemic\nnormativity of some internalist positions. It is also worth\nmentioning, that Meinong (1915, \u00a754) linked the \u201cprinciple\nof the self-validity of all knowing\u201d [Prinzip der\nSelbstg\u00fcltigkeit alles Erkennens], a kind of prima facie\njustification principle, with the fallibilistic\nmethodological-epistemological \u201cprinciple of the critical\nopenness of all knowing\u201d [Prinzip der kritischen\nUnabgeschlossenheit alles Erkennens], which says that critical\nexamination is always possible, since there is always an unverified\njudgement left at the end of a justification process.\n\nIn his Erfahrungsgrundlagen (1906) Meinong shows that a\nperception taken only from a causal point of view cannot explain, for\nexample, why a perception picks out the distant object and not\nsomething between the perceived object and the observer. In\ninvestigating important features of perception, Meinong (1906,\n\u00a722) introduces the concept of a perceptive forum\n[Wahrnehmungsforum]. The perceptive forums include the\ninternal and external moments that affect the content of a perception.\nAs such the sensing organs, the determinations of the perceived object\nand other media come into consideration. The forums are transparent in\nthe sense that you cannot tell from the perceptive act which forums\nare involved. When you see, for example, a piece of chalk, by means of\nyour spectacles, you see the chalk but you do not notice your eyes and\nyour spectacles. But it is possible that the role of such media can be\nreconstructed by using causal approaches. Fritz Heider already\ndiscussed some of this accounts in his dissertation thesis Zur\nSubjektivitaet der Sinnesqualitaeten [On the subjectivity of\nsense qualities] (1920), and later, in his paper \u201cDing und\nMedium\u201d [\u201cThing and Medium\u201d] (1926/27), he took over\nMeinong\u2019s conception that media are so to say glass \u2013\nglass can mediate the seen of objects, but glass can also be seen as\nan object. From this point of view he elaborated fundamental features\nof media. Through its interesting, detailed descriptions this study\ntogether with later papers became a forerunner of some modern theories\nof media and communication (see, for example, Luhmann 1995;\nKr\u00e4mer 2008).\n",
