    "main_text": "Religious Views\n2. Religious Views\n\nThe seventeenth century is notable not only for the number but also\nfor the variety of arguments which were offered to prove God\u2019s\nexistence. Although writers such as Pascal and Bayle felt such\narguments to be both unnecessary and unavailable, demonstrations of\nGod\u2019s existence were felt by many to be not only possible but\ndesirable, since they were necessary in the fight against\n atheism.[18]\n Descartes, as is well known, felt that God\u2019s existence could\nbe, and epistemologically had to be, demonstrated, and offered a\nvariety of proofs to provide such a demonstration. His version of the\nontological argument, his proof from the supposed innate idea of God,\nhis proof from the need for an eternal conscious\n being,[19]\n and his proof from the need for continuing creation, all found\nsupporters in the later seventeenth century, though the first two were\ngenerally held to be unlikely to convince anyone.\n",
