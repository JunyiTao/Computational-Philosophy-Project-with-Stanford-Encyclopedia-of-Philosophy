Modern Conceptions of Analysis, outside Analytic Philosophy\n\n\nAs suggested in the supplementary document on \n Kant,\n the decompositional conception of analysis found its classic \nstatement in the work of Kant at the end of the eighteenth century. \nBut Kant was only expressing a conception widespread at the time. The\nconception can be found in a very blatant form, for example, in the \nwritings of Moses Mendelssohn, for whom, unlike Kant, it was \napplicable even in the case of geometry \n [Quotation].\n Typified in Kant's and Mendelssohn's view of concepts, it\nwas also reflected in scientific practice. Indeed, its popularity was\nfostered by the chemical revolution inaugurated by Lavoisier in the \nlate eighteenth century, the comparison between philosophical \nanalysis and chemical analysis being frequently drawn. As Lichtenberg\nput it, \u201cWhichever way you look at it, philosophy is always \nanalytical chemistry\u201d \n [Quotation].\n \n\n\nThis decompositional conception of analysis set the methodological \nagenda for philosophical approaches and debates in the (late) modern \nperiod (nineteenth and twentieth centuries). Responses and \ndevelopments, very broadly, can be divided into two. On the one hand,\nan essentially decompositional conception of analysis was accepted, \nbut a critical attitude was adopted towards it. If analysis simply \ninvolved breaking something down, then it appeared destructive and \nlife-diminishing, and the critique of analysis that this view \nengendered was a common theme in idealism and romanticism in all its \nmain varieties\u2014from German, British and French to North \nAmerican. One finds it reflected, for example, in remarks about the \nnegating and soul-destroying power of analytical thinking by Schiller\n\n [Quotation],\n Hegel \n [Quotation]\n and de Chardin \n [Quotation],\n in Bradley's doctrine that analysis is falsification \n [Quotation],\n and in the emphasis placed by Bergson on \u2018intuition\u2019 \n [Quotation].\n \n\n\nOn the other hand, analysis was seen more positively, but the Kantian\nconception underwent a certain degree of modification and \ndevelopment. In the nineteenth century, this was exemplified, in \nparticular, by Bolzano and the neo-Kantians. Bolzano's most \nimportant innovation was the method of variation, which involves \nconsidering what happens to the truth-value of a sentence when a \nconstituent term is substituted by another. This formed the basis for\nhis reconstruction of the analytic/synthetic distinction, \nKant's account of which he found defective. The neo-Kantians \nemphasized the role of structure in conceptualized experience and had\na greater appreciation of forms of analysis in mathematics and \nscience. In many ways, their work attempts to do justice to \nphilosophical and scientific practice while recognizing the central \nidealist claim that analysis is a kind of abstraction that inevitably\ninvolves falsification or distortion. On the neo-Kantian view, the \ncomplexity of experience is a complexity of form and content rather \nthan of separable constituents, requiring analysis into \n\u2018moments\u2019 or \u2018aspects\u2019 rather than \n\u2018elements\u2019 or \u2018parts\u2019. In the 1910s, the idea\nwas articulated with great subtlety by Ernst Cassirer \n [Quotation],\n and became familiar in Gestalt psychology.\n\n\nIn the twentieth century, both analytic philosophy and phenomenology \ncan be seen as developing far more sophisticated conceptions of \nanalysis, which draw on but go beyond mere decompositional analysis. \nThe following \n Section\n offers an account of analysis in analytic philosophy, illustrating \nthe range and richness of the conceptions and practices that arose. \nBut it is important to see these in the wider context of \ntwentieth-century methodological practices and debates, for it is not\njust in \u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy\u2014despite its \nname\u2014that analytic methods are accorded a central role. \nPhenomenology, in particular, contains its own distinctive set of \nanalytic methods, with similarities and differences to those of \nanalytic philosophy. Phenomenological analysis has frequently been \ncompared to conceptual clarification in the ordinary language \ntradition, for example, and the method of \u2018phenomenological \nreduction\u2019 that Husserl invented in 1905 offers a striking \nparallel to the reductive project opened up by Russell's theory\nof descriptions, which also made its appearance in 1905.\n\n\nJust like Frege and Russell, Husserl's initial concern was with\nthe foundations of mathematics, and in this shared concern we can see\nthe continued influence of the regressive conception of analysis. \nAccording to Husserl, the aim of \u2018eidetic reduction\u2019, as \nhe called it, was to isolate the \u2018essences\u2019 that underlie\nour various forms of thinking, and to apprehend them by \n\u2018essential intuition\u2019 \n(\u2018Wesenserschauung\u2019). The terminology may be \ndifferent, but this resembles Russell's early project to \nidentify the \u2018indefinables\u2019 of philosophical logic, as he\ndescribed it, and to apprehend them by \u2018acquaintance\u2019 \n(cf. POM, xx). Furthermore, in Husserl's later \ndiscussion of \u2018explication\u2019 (cf. EJ, \n\u00a7\u00a7 22-4 \n [Quotations]),\n we find appreciation of the \u2018transformative\u2019 dimension of\nanalysis, which can be fruitfully compared with Carnap's \naccount of explication (see the supplementary section on \n Carnap and Logical Positivism).\n Carnap himself describes Husserl's idea here as one of \n\u201cthe synthesis of identification between a confused, \nnonarticulated sense and a subsequently intended distinct, \narticulated sense\u201d (1950, 3 \n [Quotation]).\n \n\n\nPhenomenology is not the only source of analytic methodologies \noutside those of the analytic tradition. Mention might be made here, \ntoo, of R. G. Collingwood, working within the tradition of British \nidealism, which was still a powerful force prior to the Second World \nWar. In his Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), for \nexample, he criticizes Moorean philosophy, and develops his own \nresponse to what is essentially the paradox of analysis (concerning \nhow an analysis can be both correct and informative), which he \nrecognizes as having its root in Meno's paradox. In his \nEssay on Metaphysics (1940), he puts forward his own \nconception of metaphysical analysis, in direct response to what he \nperceived as the mistaken repudiation of metaphysics by the logical \npositivists. Metaphysical analysis is characterized here as the \ndetection of \u2018absolute presuppositions\u2019, which are taken \nas underlying and shaping the various conceptual practices that can \nbe identified in the history of philosophy and science. Even among \nthose explicitly critical of central strands in analytic philosophy, \nthen, analysis in one form or another can still be seen as alive and \nwell.\n\nFor further reading, see the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a75.\n",
