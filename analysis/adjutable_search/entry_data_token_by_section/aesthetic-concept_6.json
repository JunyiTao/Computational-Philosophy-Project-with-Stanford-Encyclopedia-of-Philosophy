    "main_text": "The Concept of the Aesthetic || The Aesthetic Attitude\n2.3 The Aesthetic Attitude\n\nThe Kantian notion of disinterest has its most direct recent\ndescendents in the aesthetic-attitude theories that flourished from\nthe early to mid 20th century. Though Kant followed the British in\napplying the term \u2018disinterested\u2019 strictly to pleasures,\nits migration to attitudes is not difficult to explain. For Kant the\npleasure involved in a judgment of taste is disinterested because such\na judgment does not issue in a motive to do anything in particular.\nFor this reason Kant refers to the judgment of taste as contemplative\nrather than practical (Kant 1790, 95). But if the judgment of taste is\nnot practical, then the attitude we bear toward its object is\npresumably also not practical: when we judge an object aesthetically\nwe are unconcerned with whether and how it may further our practical\naims. Hence it is natural to speak of our attitude toward the object\nas disinterested.\n\nTo say, however, that the migration of disinterest from pleasures to\nattitudes is natural is not to say that it is inconsequential.\nConsider the difference between Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory, the\nlast great theory of taste, and Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory,\nthe first great aesthetic-attitude theory. Whereas for Kant\ndisinterested pleasure is the means by which we discover things to\nbear aesthetic value, for Schopenhauer disinterested attention (or\n\u201cwill-less contemplation\u201d) is itself the locus of\naesthetic value. According to Schopenhauer, we lead our ordinary,\npractical lives in a kind of bondage to our own desires (Schopenhauer\n1819, 196). This bondage is a source not merely of pain but also of\ncognitive distortion in that it restricts our attention to those\naspects of things relevant to the fulfilling or thwarting of our\ndesires. Aesthetic contemplation, being will-less, is therefore both\nepistemically and hedonically valuable, allowing us a desire-free\nglimpse into the essences of things as well as a respite from\ndesire-induced pain:\n\nWhen, however, an external cause or inward disposition suddenly raises\nus out of the endless stream of willing, and snatches knowledge from\nthe thralldom of the will, the attention is now no longer directed to\nthe motives of willing, but comprehends things free from their\nrelation to the will \u2026 Then all at once the peace, always\nsought but always escaping us \u2026 comes to us of its own accord,\nand all is well with us. (Schopenhauer 1819, 196)\n\n\nThe two most influential aesthetic-attitude theories of the 20th\ncentury are those of Edward Bullough and Jerome Stolnitz. According to\nStolnitz\u2019s theory, which is the more straightforward of the two,\nbearing an aesthetic attitude toward an object is a matter of\nattending to it disinterestedly and sympathetically, where to attend\nto it disinterestedly is to attend to it with no purpose beyond that\nof attending to it, and to attend to it sympathetically is to\n\u201caccept it on its own terms,\u201d allowing it, and not\none\u2019s own preconceptions, to guide one\u2019s attention of it\n(Stolnitz 1960, 32\u201336). The result of such attention is a\ncomparatively richer experience of the object, i.e., an experience\ntaking in comparatively many of the object\u2019s features. Whereas a\npractical attitude limits and fragments the object of our experience,\nallowing us to \u201csee only those of its features which are\nrelevant to our purposes,\u2026. By contrast, the aesthetic attitude\n\u2018isolates\u2019 the object and focuses upon it\u2014the\n\u2018look\u2019 of the rocks, the sound of the ocean, the colors in\nthe painting.\u201d (Stolnitz 1960, 33, 35).\n\nBullough, who prefers to speak of \u201cpsychical distance\u201d\nrather than disinterest, characterizes aesthetic appreciation as\nsomething achieved\n\nby putting the phenomenon, so to speak, out of gear with our actual\npractical self; by allowing it to stand outside the context of our\npersonal needs and ends\u2014in short, by looking at it\n\u2018objectively\u2019 \u2026 by permitting only such reactions\non our part as emphasise the \u2018objective features of the\nexperience, and by interpreting even our \u2018subjective\u2019\naffections not as modes of our being but rather as\ncharacteristics of the phenomenon. (Bullough 1995, 298\u2013299;\nemphasis in original).\n\n\nBullough has been criticized for claiming that aesthetic appreciation\nrequires dispassionate detachment:\n\nBullough\u2019s characterization of the aesthetic attitude is the\neasiest to attack. When we cry at a tragedy, jump in fear at a horror\nmovie, or lose ourselves in the plot of a complex novel, we cannot be\nsaid to be detached, although we may be appreciating the aesthetic\nqualities of these works to the fullest\u2026 . And we can\nappreciate the aesthetic properties of the fog or storm while fearing\nthe dangers they present. (Goldman 2005, 264)\n\n\nBut such a criticism seems to overlook a subtlety of Bullough\u2019s\nview. While Bullough does hold that aesthetic appreciation requires\ndistance \u201cbetween our own self and its affections\u201d\n(Bullough 1995, 298), he does not take this to require that we not\nundergo affections but quite the opposite: only if we undergo\naffections have we affections from which to be distanced. So, for\nexample, the properly distanced spectator of a well-constructed\ntragedy is not the \u201cover-distanced\u201d spectator who feels no\npity or fear, nor the \u201cunder-distanced\u201d spectator who\nfeels pity and fear as she would to an actual, present catastrophe,\nbut the spectator who interprets the pity and fear she feels\n\u201cnot as modes of [her] being but rather as characteristics of\nthe phenomenon\u201d (Bullough 1995, 299). The properly distanced\nspectator of a tragedy, we might say, understands her fear and pity to\nbe part of what tragedy is about.\n\nThe notion of the aesthetic attitude has been attacked from all\ncorners and has very few remaining sympathizers. George Dickie is\nwidely regarded as having delivered the decisive blow in his essay\n\u201cThe Myth of the Aesthetic Attitude\u201d (Dickie 1964) by\narguing that all purported examples of interested attention are really\njust examples of inattention. So consider the case of the spectator at\na performance of Othello who becomes increasingly suspicious\nof his own wife as the action proceeds, or the case of the impresario\nwho sits gauging the size of the audience, or the case of the father\nwho sits taking pride in his daughter\u2019s performance, or the case\nof the moralist who sits gauging the moral effects the play is apt to\nproduce in its audience. These and all such cases will be regarded by\nthe attitude theorist as cases of interested attention to the\nperformance, when they are actually nothing but cases of inattention\nto the performance: the jealous husband is attending to his wife, the\nimpresario to the till, the father to his daughter, the moralist to\nthe effects of the play. But if none of them is attending to the\nperformance, then none of them is attending to it interestedly (Dickie\n1964, 57\u201359).\n\nThe attitude theorist, however, can plausibly resist Dickie\u2019s\ninterpretation of such examples. Clearly the impresario is not\nattending to the performance, but there is no reason to regard the\nattitude theorist as committed to thinking otherwise. As for the\nothers, it might be argued that they are all attending. The jealous\nhusband must be attending to the performance, since it is the action\nof the play, as presented by the performance, that is making him\nsuspicious. The proud father must be attending to the performance,\nsince he is attending to his daughter\u2019s performance, which is an\nelement of it. The moralist must be attending to the performance,\nsince he otherwise would have no basis by which to gauge its moral\neffects on the audience. It may be that none of these spectators is\ngiving the performance the attention it demands, but that is precisely\nthe attitude theorist\u2019s point.\n\nBut perhaps another of Dickie\u2019s criticisms, one lesser known,\nultimately poses a greater threat to the ambitions of the attitude\ntheorist. Stolnitz, it will be recalled, distinguishes between\ndisinterested and interested attention according to the purpose\ngoverning the attention: to attend disinterestedly is to attend with\nno purpose beyond that of attending; to attend interestedly is to\nattend with some purpose beyond that of attending. But Dickie objects\nthat a difference in purpose does not imply a difference in\nattention:\n\nSuppose Jones listens to a piece of music for the purpose of being\nable to analyze and describe it on an examination the next day and\nSmith listens to the same music with no such ulterior purpose. There\nis certainly a difference in the motives and intentions of the two\nmen: Jones has an ulterior purpose and Smith does not, but this does\nnot mean Jones\u2019s listening differs from Smith\u2019s\n\u2026 . There is only one way to listen to (to attend to)\nmusic, although there may be a variety of motives, intentions, and\nreasons for doing so and a variety of ways of being distracted from\nthe music. (Dickie 1964, 58).\n\n\nThere is again much here that the attitude theorist can resist. The\nidea that listening is a species of attending can be resisted: the\nquestion at hand, strictly speaking, is not whether Jones and Smith\nlisten to the music in the same way, but whether they\nattend in the same way to the music they are listening to.\nThe contention that Jones and Smith are attending in the same way\nappears to be question-begging, as it evidently depends on a principle\nof individuation that the attitude theorist rejects: if Jones\u2019s\nattention is governed by some ulterior purpose and Smith\u2019s is\nnot, and we individuate attention according to the purpose that\ngoverns it, their attention is not the same. Finally, even if we\nreject the attitude theorist\u2019s principle of individuation, the\nclaim that there is but one way to attend to music is doubtful: one\ncan seemingly attend to music in myriad ways\u2014as historical\ndocument, as cultural artifact, as aural wallpaper, as sonic\ndisturbance\u2014depending on which of the music\u2019s features one\nattends to in listening to it. But Dickie is nevertheless onto\nsomething crucial to the degree he urges that a difference in purpose\nneed not imply a relevant difference in attention.\nDisinterest plausibly figures in the definition of the aesthetic\nattitude only to the degree that it, and it alone, focuses attention\non the features of the object that matter aesthetically. The\npossibility that there are interests that focus attention on just\nthose same features implies that disinterest has no place in such a\ndefinition, which in turn implies that neither it nor the notion of\nthe aesthetic attitude is likely to be of any use in fixing the\nmeaning of the term \u2018aesthetic.\u2019 If to take the aesthetic\nattitude toward an object simply is to attend to its aesthetically\nrelevant properties, whether the attention is interested or\ndisinterested, then determining whether an attitude is aesthetic\napparently requires first determining which properties are the\naesthetically relevant ones. And this task seems always to result\neither in claims about the immediate graspability of aesthetic\nproperties, which are arguably insufficient to the task, or in claims\nabout the essentially formal nature of aesthetic properties, which are\narguably groundless.\n\nBut that the notions of disinterest and psychical distance prove\nunhelpful in fixing the meaning of the term \u2018aesthetic\u2019\ndoes not imply that they are mythic. At times we seem unable to get by\nwithout them. Consider the case of The Fall of\nMiletus\u2014a tragedy written by the Greek dramatist Phrynicus\nand staged in Athens barely two years after the violent Persian\ncapture of the Greek city of Miletus in 494 BC. Herodotus records\nthat\n\n[the Athenians] found many ways to express their sorrow at the fall of\nMiletus, and in particular, when Phrynicus composed and produced a\nplay called The Fall of Miletus, the audience burst into\ntears and fined him a thousand drachmas for reminding them of a\ndisaster that was so close to home; future productions of the play\nwere also banned. (Herodotus, The Histories, 359)\n\n\nHow are we to explain the Athenian reaction to this play without\nrecourse to something like interest or lack of distance? How, in\nparticular, are we to explain the difference between the sorrow\nelicited by a successful tragedy and the sorrow elicited in this case?\nThe distinction between attention and inattention is of no use here.\nThe difference is not that the Athenians could not attend to The\nFall whereas they could attend to other plays. The difference is\nthat they could not attend to The Fall as they could attend\nto other plays, and this because of their too intimate connection to\nwhat attending to The Fall required their attending to.\n",
