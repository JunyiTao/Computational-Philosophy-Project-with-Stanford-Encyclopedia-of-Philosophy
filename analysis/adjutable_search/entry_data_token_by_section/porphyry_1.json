    "main_text": "Works and Profile\n2. Works and Profile\n\nPorphyry was a prolific author who wrote about a whole range of\ntopics. There are some sixty works attributed to him, but most of them\nare now lost or survive in mere fragments. Extant (though not all\ncomplete) are: Life of Plotinus, Life of Pythagoras,\nLetter to Marcella, On Abstinence from Eating Food from\nAnimals, Starting-points Leading to the Intelligibles\n(usually called the Sententiae; in Latin the work is called\nSententiae ad intelligibilia ducentes), the Isagoge\n(Introduction), On the cave of the Nymphs,\nIntroduction to Ptolemy\u2019s opus quadripartitum (see\nBezza 2012) and there are commentaries on Ptolemy\u2019s\nHarmonics and Aristotle\u2019s Categories. An\nextant work attributed to Galen, To Gaurus, is almost\ncertainly by him. There are fragments of a history of philosophy and\nfragments of a number of works on psychology. One such work, the\nSymmikta zetemata, has been partly reconstructed by Heinrich\nD\u00f6rrie (1959). It has been argued by Pierre Hadot (1968 and\nseveral articles) that Porphyry is the author of anonymous fragments\nof a commentary on Plato\u2019s Parmenides. This attribution\nhas been widely accepted but also forcefully challenged (see below).\nHe also wrote commentaries on Plato\u2019s Timaeus and\nseveral works by Aristotle. The fragments of these are given in Smith\n1993, which contains the extant fragments and testimonia of Porphyry.\nIn addition we know that Porphyry wrote on such diverse subjects as\ngrammar, philology, rhetoric, and geometry. Against the\nChristians is perhaps Porphyry\u2019s best known title. Of this\nlarge work only some fragments have survived.\n\nIn his monumental study, La vie de Porphyre (1913), Bidez\nportrayed the young Porphyry as someone prone to religion and\nsuperstition. He was supposed to have become a more rational thinker\nduring his sojourn with Plotinus, though later to have relapsed to\nsome extent into his previous mode. Later research has found that\nthere is no clear support for such a view of Porphyry\u2019s\ndevelopment. He may throughout his life have used different styles,\nperhaps aiming at different readerships, while maintaining somehow\nboth his proneness for religion and superstition and his rational\ntendencies.\n\nIt is clear that Porphyry was a very learned man. He is sometimes\nclaimed as a highly important promulgator of the late ancient branch\nof Platonism (usually called \u2018Neoplatonism\u2019) rather than\nas an original philosopher. The former claim is certainly true: he\napplied Neoplatonic doctrines to traditional pagan religion and myths\nand was in many respects a more extrovert thinker interested in\napplying Platonic philosophy to various spheres than his master,\nPlotinus. The judgment that he was unoriginal may, however, be\noverhasty, since the sample of his writings we are left with is very\nsmall and among these his more theoretical works are clearly\nunderrepresented. What we have and know to be his, however, does not\nindicate drastic theoretical innovations, except in the sphere of the\nphilosophy of logic and language. To judge from the evidence of\nsubsequent ancient Platonists, Porphyry was an independent philosopher\nwhose views were taken very seriously indeed. Late ancient Platonists,\nhowever, often mention him in the pair \u201cPlotinus and\nPorphyry\u201d. So, as should be clear from what already has been\nsaid, Porphyrian scholarship, when soberly done, is filled with\ncaveats: we rarely know when he wrote what, and we do not know for\nsure what his philosophical doctrines were. What is extant suggests a\nclose doctrinal affinity with Plotinus, except for the fragment of the\nParmenides commentary for which the authorship and\nrelationship to Porphyry is disputed. To this we can add\nPorphyry\u2019s take on Aristotle\u2019s Categories with\nconsequences for his view on the structure of the sensible realm.\nThus, we are faced with a figure whom we know to have been respected\nin late antiquity, who was influential long beyond then, but we do not\nknow with any certainty what he stood for philosophically or what was\noriginal with him in the central areas of philosophy.\n",
