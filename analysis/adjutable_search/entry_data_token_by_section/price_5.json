    "main_text": "Four General Features || Metaphysical Neutrality\n2.4 Metaphysical Neutrality\n\nFourth, despite his major contributions to metaphysics, Price often\nmaintains metaphysical neutrality. For instance, he provides the most\nworked-out and discussed account of resemblance nominalism in the\nliterature (1953a: chapter 1), but ultimately stays neutral about\nwhether realism about (Aristotelian) universals (1953a: 10\u201314)\nis true.\n \u00a75.1\n discusses this extensively. He is also metaphysically neutral about\nthe nature of sense-data. Generally, his metaphysical neutralism takes\nthis form: First, he finds that the empirical evidence points us to\nthe existence of such things as sense-data, mental phenomena\n(including psychical phenomena), concepts, dispositions to recognise\nconcepts, etc. However, second, the empirical evidence does not\nadjudicate between whether sense-data are physical, mental, or\nneither, or whether our recognitional dispositions track resemblances\nor universals, etc. So, he neither affirms nor denies any of these\nmetaphysical accounts.\n\nAlso, Price (1940a) articulates two forms of Neo-Humeanism about\nexternal objects which are essentially neutralist; see\n \u00a7\u00a74.3\u20134.4\n below.\n\nTo be clear: he is no across-the-board metaphysical neutralist. For\ninstance, unlike his positivist colleagues (e.g., Ayer), he\ndoesn\u2019t think that metaphysics is nonsense. He is very critical\nof declarations of nonsense (1939 [1995: 26]; 1945: 30\u201331). He\ndefends positive ontological and metaphysical positions, e.g., the\nontological reality of sense-data and of dispositions, when\nhis evidence allows him to. But when his evidence is inconclusive, he\nstays neutral.\n\nWhen defending sense-data, Price (1932: 19\u201320) stresses what he\ncalls the neutrality of the admissions of sense-data in his\nsense. There is no immediate commitment to their persistence\nconditions, their privacy or publicity, the kind of entity they are,\nnor to their origins: the nature of sense-data is not given to us.\nUnderstanding them for instance as \u201csensible species\u201d\n(some Scholastics), \u201cimpressions\u201d (Hume), or\n\u201csensa\u201d (Broad) begs the question, for they bring in the\nassumption that their nature is physical, mental, or neither,\nrespectively (see also Murray 1933: 507f). Thus, he characteristically\nneither accepts nor denies any of these further metaphysical\nassumptions: they go beyond what he takes to be the evidence. Price\n(1927: 110) also compares not being immediately aware of the\nnature of sense-data with not being immediately aware of\nphysical objects. This neutrality-until-further-examination regarding\n\u201csense-data\u201d in effect places Price close to Moore\u2019s\n(1903; 1957[1965]) way of introducing sense-data (see also Lean 1953:\n2\u20133; Bauer 1967: 8\u20139; Crane 2000: 175\u2013177). In\nsummary, Price puts it thus: \n\n\nSo far as the main theme of this book goes, it really does not matter\nhow we answer them [\u2026 i.e. the questions about] the\nnature of sense-data. (1932: 104)\n\n\nDespite this metaphysical neutrality about the nature of\nsense-data, he is not ontologically neutral. He argues that sense-data\nare what are given to us and what are sensed in perceptual\nexperiences, which we obviously have: we simply have to accept their\nexistence. And, they have whatever nature they must have to\nplay the role in experience that they do, a role that allows them (a)\nto be related to the material things which we suppose are in the\nworld, and (b) to enable our consciousness of those material\nthings.\n\nHowever, even his metaphysical neutrality is not complete: it does not\nextend to denying metaphysical features that are phenomenogically\ngiven (recall\n \u00a72.1);\n for instance, it is to misunderstand visual sense-data to take them\nto be two-dimensional: \u201cIt is a plain phenomenological fact that\nvisual fields have the property of depth\u201d (1954a:\nvii\u2013viii; for discussion: Jackson 1977: 102; Crane 1992a: 15;\nBaldwin 1992: 183\u2013184; Martin 1992: 198). Price\u2019s\nmetaphysical neutralism, however, doesn\u2019t underplay metaphysical\nspeculation\u2019s importance for philosophy and science: he\nwrites,\n\n\nIf people accuse us of being speculative and even\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d we must refuse to be frightened. We must\npostulate unverifiable entities and processes if we cannot get on\nwithout them. The task of philosophical deflation, of\nremoving unnecessary metaphysical entities, comes at the end of a\nscience\u2019s progress, not at the beginning; if such writers as\nHume and Mach and the modern Logical Positivists had lived in the\nearly seventeenth century, Physics would never have got itself\nstarted.
