    "main_text": "Leibniz on the Laws of Motion\n4. Leibniz on the Laws of Motion\n\n\nThe laws of motion held a privileged place in the mechanical \nphilosophy of the early modern period. Together with bodies they \nserved as the chief explanatory postulates of the new physics. It is \nthus not surprising that Leibniz held strong views concerning the \njustification of the laws of motion, the content of those laws, and \ntheir implications for the epistemology and metaphysics of motion. In\nthinking about Leibniz\u2019s positive views on the laws of motion, it \nmight prove once again helpful to first look at his reasons for being\ndissatisfied with the account offered by Descartes. \n",
