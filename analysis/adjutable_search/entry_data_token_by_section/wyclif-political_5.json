    "main_text": "Divine Dominium: Creating, Lending, and Grace || Natural Dominium\n3.1 Natural Dominium\n\nDe Civili Dominio begins with the motto, \u201cCivil justice\npresupposes divine justice; civil dominium presupposes\nnatural dominium.\u201d Man's dominium is threefold \u2014\nnatural, civil, and evangelical \u2014 but comprehensible as an\ninstantiation of the justice of God's dominium. As he moved\ninto his general analysis of human dominium, Wyclif's\nthoughts turned to the most fundamental instance of God's loving\ngovernance, the Scriptural commandments. The foundation of all that is\nright (ius) in creation, he explains, is divine justice\n(iustitia), so we cannot begin to understand right and wrong\nin creation without understanding God's uncreated right. This was a\nsignificant departure from the Aristotelian position that unaided\nhuman reason is capable of justice, and Wyclif explicitly rejects any\nconception of justice that does not rely on uncreated\n right.[8]\n The laws of Scripture are the purest expression of uncreated right\navailable to human eyes, he explains, and are most clearly expressed\nin the Ten Commandments of Exodus 20, and again in the two greatest\ncommandments of Matthew 22: 37\u201340. Wyclif's analysis of Christ's law\nof love and of the Ten Commandments proceeds directly from his\ndisquisition on the relation of earthly justice to eternal right in\nDe Mandatis Divinis. That Wyclif uses the same title\n Robert Grosseteste\n had used in his analysis of the decalogue is no accident; Wyclif's\ndebt to Grosseteste's conceptions of sin, love of God, idolatry, and\nthe substance of true faith is obvious throughout the treatise. In\nDe Statu Innocencie, the innocence into which we were created\nbefore the Fall, he says, is the optimal condition for any rational\nbeing. In our prelapsarian state, our wills would have been in perfect\nconcord with the divine will, so that all human action would be just,\neffortlessly aligned with the natural order of creation. In this\ncondition, there would be no need for civil or criminal law, since we\nunderstood what is right naturally.\n\n\nThis denial of the need for human law is of special import, for Wyclif\nlater argues that the evangelical lord, or priest, as heir of Christ's\nrestoration of the possibility of natural dominium, should\nnever be concerned with such matters. In such a state, private\nproperty ownership was unknown. The natural dominium\ndescribed in Genesis 1:26 is characterized by lack of selfishness,\nownership, or any distinction between 'mine' and 'thine'. The true\nsense of Augustine's \u201cAll things belong to the just\u201d is most fully\napparent in the prelapsarian natural disposition to share in the use\nof creation while acting as faithful steward to its perfect lord. The\nFall was brought about by the first sin, which Wyclif characterizes as\na privation of God's right in man's soul. We are left with wills prone\nto value the physical, material world above spiritual concerns, and\nthe unavoidable result is private property ownership. We no longer\nunderstand a given created good as a gift on loan from God, but can\nonly see it in terms of our own self-interest, and the unfortunate\nresult is civil dominium, an enslavement to material goods.\n\n",
