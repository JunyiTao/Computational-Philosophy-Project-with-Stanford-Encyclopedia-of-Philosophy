    "main_text": "\n\nThe \u2018influence\u2019 of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on Judaic\nthought has never been studied as a whole: as a matter of fact, in\nrecent times it has not yet been the object of a comprehensive and\ndetailed analysis, apart from that made in a general article (Zonta\n1997a; see also a wide table and a short sketch of the\nArabic-to-Hebrew philosophical works: Zonta 2011b and 2011c). That\narticle concentrated on some particular subjects of this\n\u2018influence\u2019, i.e. on the quotations, translations and\ninterpretations of the texts written by some Arab-Islamic philosophers\n(the Brethren of Purity, Avicenna, and Averroes), but did not include\nother authors, as al-Kindi, al-Ghazali or Ibn Bajja, nor some minor\nfigures which left some traces in Medieval Jewish philosophy. Of\ncourse, the question of the general \u2018influence\u2019 of\nArab-Islamic philosophers on prominent authors as Ibn Gabirol and\nMaimonides has been examined in specific articles and parts of books\n(see in particular Pessin 2007, Davidson 2011, Pessin 2013). However,\nthis has not happened in the case of other Jewish authors, although a\nnumber of more or less explicit or implicit references to Medieval\nArabic and Islamic philosophy have been found by modern scholars in\nmany Jewish authors, active in the period 900\u20131500: among the\nmost well-known of them, are Jacob al-Qirqisani, Isaac Israeli,\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol, Bahya Ibn Paquda, Abraham bar Hiyya, Joseph Ibn\nZaddik, Moses Ibn Ezra, Judah Halevi, Abraham Ibn Daud, Moses\nMaimonides, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera, Levi ben\nGershom (Gersonides), Moses Narboni, and Hasdai Crescas. Usually, the\ndiscovery of these references has not driven modern scholars to arrive\nat even tentative conclusions about the real extent of this\n\u2018influence\u2019 and the ways of its spreading among Jewish\nauthors, apart from some particular cases \u2013 for example, that of\nArabic sources of 14th-century Jewish logic in Provence\n(see Zonta 1997b).\n\nDue to the complexity of the theme and the substantial shortage of\nprevious works especially and systematically devoted to it, a\ncomprehensive, if not detailed, analysis of the\n\u2018influence\u2019 of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on Judaic\nthought should observe some limits. The concept of\n\u201cinfluence\u201d in itself should be restricted to the cases\nwhere a direct and evident, if not necessarily explicit, employment of\nArabic and Islamic sources by Jewish authors has been or can be\nclearly ascertained. (For example, it is well-known that Maimonides\ndirectly knew and employed a number of Arabic philosophical sources;\nhowever, it should be admitted that, in many cases, Late Medieval\nJewish authors knew and employed these sources not directly, but\nthrough Maimonides.) This analysis should not limit itself to the\ncases when the text (or the texts) of an author were merely\n\u201ctranslated\u201d into Hebrew or literally quoted in their\nArabic originals. These cases have been studied in some books\n(Steinschneider 1893, Zonta 1996) and in a number of recent articles,\nbut such analysis should now spread to the cases where these texts\nwere commented on and in some cases directly and actually employed by\nJewish thinkers for building up their own philosophy. (In that regard,\nit should be noted that many Late Medieval Jewish philosophers seem to\nhave known Avicenna\u2019s philosophy; in reality, some of them might\nhave known it not directly, but mostly through al-Ghazali \u2013 as\nmight have happened even in the case of Maimonides too.) A historical\nexamination of this influence should proceed not according to the main\nlines of the history of Jewish philosophy, but according to the\nchronological order of the various Arabic and Islamic philosophers who\nwere read by Jewish authors, either in their original texts, or in\nMedieval Hebrew translations, or in some cases even in Medieval Latin\nversions \u2013 and it should be clear that Jewish philosophers\napparently did not employ as sources Arabic authors active after 1200\ncirca. Such examination should consider that \u201cArabic\nphilosophy\u201d and \u201cIslamic philosophy\u201d cannot be\ntotally identified, but their relationship appears at times to be just\nlike the intersection of two not completely identical concepts. (For\nexample, some major works of Islamic philosophy like Avicenna\u2019s\nThe Book of Science [Danesh name], were written in\nPersian, while there were some Medieval Christian philosophers active\nin the Near East who wrote their works in Arabic, and who should\nbetter be put among the cases of \u201cinfluence of\n[Christian-]Arabic philosophy on Judaic thought\u201d.)\n",
