    "main_text": "Russell\u2019s Humean Wobble: Human Society in Ethics and Politics\n12. Conclusion\n\nWe started out with Russell\u2019s adverse verdict on his own meta-ethics:\n\u201cI am not, myself, satisfied with what I have read or said on\nthe philosophical basis of ethics\u201d (RoE:\n165/Papers 11: 310\u201311). And we can see in a sense that\nhe was right. Every meta-ethic that he developed seems to be subject\nto insuperable, objections. But although Russell\u2019s writings on ethics\nare unsatisfactory, this does not mean that they are worthless.\nMeta-ethics is a difficult subject and it is hard to get it right. And\nif we ever are to get it right, we must learn from those,\nlike Russell, who got it interestingly and instructively wrong. In the\ncourse of his long philosophical career, Russell canvassed most of the\nmeta-ethical options that have dominated debate in the Twentieth and\nTwenty-First Centuries\u2014naturalism, non-naturalism, emotivism and\nthe error-theory, and even, to some extent, subjectivism and\nrelativism. And though none of his theories quite worked out, there is\nmuch to be learned from his mistakes. Nor is this all. His\narguments as well as his theories are often\ninteresting and instructive. As we have seen, the ethical corollary to\nthe argument of \u201cSeems Madam? Nay, It Is,\u201d puts the kybosh\non any attempt to resolve Sidgwick\u2019s Dualism of Practical Reason by\narguing that although we are distinct beings with different interests\nin the world of Appearance, we are, in Reality, all one\n (\u00a73).\n Russell\u2019s arguments against objectivism are often quite powerful, and\none anticipates Gilbert Harman\u2019s, influential argument that objective\nvalues can be safely dismissed since they lack explanatory power\n (\u00a79.3\u20139.4).\n Russell\u2019s damning critique of Moore\u2019s analytic consequentialism led\nMoore to abandon the view and perhaps to give up his \u201cunduly\nanti-reforming\u201d moral conservatism. Moreover Russell\u2019s\nindirect influence on meta-ethics may have been profound\nsince the Open Question Argument, was probably invented to deal with\nRussell\u2019s ideas. Finally, in the realm of normative ethics, Russell\ndeveloped a sensible and humane version of consequentialism, which\n(despite its shaky meta-ethical foundations) is resistant, if not\nimmune, to many of the standard criticisms, especially if\ncombined\u2014as Russell thought it should be combined\u2014with a\nhealthy dose of political skepticism. It provides a powerful tool for\nsocial and political criticism, a tool which Russell vigorously\nemployed on a vast range of topics in his writings on practical\nethics.\n\nIndeed, I should emphasize that, lengthy as this entry is, I have said\nvirtually nothing about the vast bulk of Russell\u2019s writings on moral\nand political topics. If we are to judge by his literary output,\nRussell was much more interested in social and political questions and\nthe rights and wrongs of war and peace than in abstract questions of\nethical theory. But, when it comes to Russell\u2019s popular writings,\nthere is no need for an intermediary. His books are easy to get hold\nof, easy to read, often very funny, and, despite the now dated\nallusions, easy to understand. Read them yourself and make up your own\nmind.\n",
