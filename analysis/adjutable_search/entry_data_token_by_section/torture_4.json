    "main_text": "The Moral Justification for One-off Acts of Torture in Emergencies || Case Study \u2013 The Terrorist and the Ticking Bomb\n3.2 Case Study \u2013 The Terrorist and the Ticking Bomb\n\nConsider the following case study:\n\n\nA terrorist group has planted a small nuclear device with a timing\nmechanism in London and it is about to go off. If it does it will kill\nthousands and make a large part of the city uninhabitable for decades.\nOne of the terrorists has been captured by the police, and if he can\nbe made to disclose the location of the device then the police can\nprobably disarm it and thereby save the lives of thousands. The police\nknow the terrorist in question. They know he has orchestrated\nterrorist attacks, albeit non-nuclear ones, in the past. Moreover, on\nthe basis of intercepted mobile phone calls and e-mails the police\nknow that this attack is under way in some location in London and that\nhe is the leader of the group. Unfortunately, the terrorist is\nrefusing to talk and time is slipping away. However, the police know\nthat there is a reasonable chance that he will talk, if tortured.\nMoreover, all their other sources of information have dried up.\nFurthermore, there is no other way to avoid catastrophe; evacuation of\nthe city, for example, cannot be undertaken in the limited time\navailable. Torture is not normally used by the police, and indeed it\nis unlawful to use it.\n\n\nIn this case study there is also a substantial moral justification for\ntorture, albeit one that many moral absolutists do not find\ncompelling. Consider the following points: (1) The police reasonably\nbelieve that torturing the terrorist will probably save thousands of\ninnocent lives; (2) the police know that there is no other way to save\nthose lives; (3) the threat to life is more or less imminent; (4) the\nthousands about to be murdered are innocent \u2013 the terrorist has no\ngood, let alone decisive, justificatory moral reason for murdering\nthem; (5) the terrorist is known to be (jointly with the other\nterrorists) morally responsible for planning, transporting, and arming\nthe nuclear device and, if it explodes, he will be (jointly with the\nother terrorists) morally responsible for the murder of thousands.\n\nIn addition to the above set of moral considerations, consider the\nfollowing points. The terrorist is culpable on two counts. Firstly,\nthe terrorist is forcing the police to choose between two evils,\nnamely, torturing the terrorist or allowing thousands of lives to be\nlost. Were the terrorist to do what he ought to do, namely, disclose\nthe location of the ticking bomb, the police could refrain from\ntorturing him. This would be true of the terrorist, even if he were\nnot actively participating in the bombing project. Secondly, the\nterrorist is in the process of completing his (jointly undertaken)\naction of murdering thousands of innocent people. He has already\nundertaken his individual actions of, say, transporting and arming the\nnuclear device; he has performed these individual actions (in the\ncontext of other individual actions performed by the other members of\nthe terrorist cell) in order to realise the end (shared by the other\nmembers of the cell) of murdering thousands of Londoners. In refusing\nto disclose the location of the device the terrorist is preventing the\npolice from preventing him from completing his (joint) action of\nmurdering thousands of innocent\n people.[14]\n To this extent the terrorist is in a different situation from a\nbystander who happens to know where the bomb is planted but will not\nreveal its whereabouts, and in a different situation from someone who\nmight have inadvertently put life at risk (Miller (2005); Hill\n(2007)).\n\nIn the institutional environment described, torture is both unlawful\nand highly unusual. Accordingly the police, if it is discovered that\nthey have tortured the terrorist, would be tried for a serious crime\nand, if found guilty, sentenced. We will return to this issue in the\nfollowing section. Here simply note that the bare illegality of their\nact of torture does not render it morally impermissible, given it was\notherwise morally permissible. Here it is the bare fact that it is\nillegal that is in question. So the relevant moral considerations\ncomprise whatever moral weight attaches to compliance with the law\njust for the sake of compliance with the law, as distinct from\ncompliance for the sake of the public benefits the law brings or\ncompliance because of the moral weight that attaches to the moral\nprinciple that a particular law might embody. But even if it is held\nthat compliance with the law for its own sake has some moral\nweight \u2013 and arguably it has none \u2013 it does not have\nsufficient moral weight to make a decisive difference in this kind of\nscenario. In short, if torturing the terrorist is morally permissible\nabsent questions of legality, the bare fact of torture being illegal\ndoes not render it morally impermissible.\n\nNote also that since the terrorist is, when being tortured, still in\nthe process of attempting to complete his (joint) action of murdering\nthousands of Londoners, and murdering also the police about to torture\nhim, the post factum legal defence of necessity may well be\navailable to the police should they subsequently be tried for\n torture.[15]\n\nSome commentators on scenarios of this kind are reluctant to concede\nthat the police are morally entitled \u2013 let alone morally\nobliged \u2013 to torture the offender. How do these commentators\njustify their position?\n\nSomeone might claim that torture is an absolute moral wrong (Matthews\n2008; Brecher 2008). (For criticisms of these authors see\nespecially Steinhoff 2013 and Allhoff 2012.) On this view there\nsimply are no real or imaginable circumstances in which torture could\nbe morally justified.\n\nThis is a hard view to sustain, not least because we have already seen\nthat being tortured is not necessarily worse than being killed, and\ntorturing someone not necessarily morally worse than killing him.\nNaturally, someone might hold that killing is an absolute moral wrong,\ni.e., killing anyone \u2013 no matter how guilty \u2013 is never morally\njustified. This view is consistent with holding that torture is an\nabsolute moral wrong, i.e. torturing anyone \u2013 no matter how\nguilty \u2013 is never morally justified. However, the price of\nconsistency is very high. The view that killing is an absolute moral\nwrong is a very implausible one. It would rule out, for example,\nkilling in self-defence. Let us, therefore, set it aside and continue\nwith the view that torture, but not killing, is an absolute moral\nwrong.\n\nFor those who hold that killing is not an absolute moral wrong, it is\nvery difficult to see how torture could be an absolute moral wrong,\ngiven that killing is sometimes morally worse than torture. In\nparticular, it is difficult to see how torturing (but not killing) the\nguilty terrorist and saving the lives of thousands could be morally\nworse than refraining from torturing him and allowing him to murder\nthousands \u2013 torturing the terrorist is a temporary infringement of\nhis autonomy, whereas his detonating of the nuclear device is a\npermanent violation of the autonomy of thousands.\n\nIn conclusion, the view that it is, all things considered, morally\nwrong to torture the terrorist in the scenario outlined faces very\nserious objections; and it is difficult to see how these objections\ncan be met. It is plausible, therefore, that there are some imaginable\ncircumstances in which it is morally permissible to torture\nsomeone.\n\nLet us now turn to the other argument of those opposing the moral\npermissibility of torture mentioned above. This is not the argument\nthat torture is an absolute moral wrong but rather that, as Michael\nDavis puts it, \u201cFor all practical purposes \u2013 and so, for\nmoral agents like us \u2013 torture is absolutely morally wrong\u201d\n(2005: 170). The basic idea is that while torture is not an absolute\nmoral wrong in the sense that the evil involved in performing any act\nof torture is so great as to override any other conceivable set of\nmoral considerations, nevertheless, there are no moral considerations\nthat in the real world have overridden, or ever will override, the\nmoral injunction against torture; the principle of refraining from\ntorture has always trumped, and will always trump, other moral\nimperatives. Proponents of this view can happily accept that the\noffenders in putative examples should be tortured, while\nsimultaneously claiming that the scenarios in these examples are\nentirely fanciful ones that have never been, and will never be,\nrealised in the real world.\n\nIt is important to stress here that the kind of scenario under\ndiscussion remains that of the one-off case of torture in an emergency\nsituation; what is not under consideration in this section is\nlegalised, or otherwise institutionalised, torture.\n\nThe central claim of the proponents of \u201cpractical moral\nabsolutes\u201d seems to be an empirical one; ticking bomb scenarios,\nsuch as our above-described terrorist case \u2013 and other relevant\none-off emergencies such as our above-described police beating case in\nwhich torture seems to be justified \u2013 have not, and will not,\nhappen.\n\nThe first point to be made is simply to reiterate that some of these\nscenarios \u2013 such as police officers beating up kidnappers and\nother offenders to rescue children \u2013 are not only realistic, they\nare real; they have actually happened. What of the ticking bomb\nscenario in particular? As stated above, it is by no means\nself-evident that this kind of scenario is entirely fanciful. Here it\ncan be conceded that there is no guarantee that torture would succeed\nin saving the lives of (to revert to our specific ticking bomb\nscenario) thousands of Londoners. This is because the person tortured\nmight not talk or he might talk too late or he might provide false or\nmisleading information. However, it should be noted that the police\nknow that the offender has committed the offence and is in a\nposition to provide the needed information, i.e. the police know that\nthe offender is guilty. Moreover, the information being sought is\ncheckable; if the terrorist gives the correct location of the bomb\nthen the police will find it \u2013 if he does not, then they will not\nfind it. Further, the police have no alternative methods by which to\navoid the death of the innocent. Given what is at stake and given the\nfact that the police know the offenders are guilty, the police are, it\nseems, justified in the use of torture, notwithstanding a degree of\nuncertainty in relation to the likelihood of success. (See Thiessen\n(2010) for arguments that so-called enhanced interrogation techniques\ndo in fact work.)\n\nThe second point is that, practicalities notwithstanding, the\nproponents of \u201cpractical moral absolutes\u201d still need to\noffer a principled account of the moral limits to torture \u2013 an\naccount of torture, so to speak, in the abstract. And these accounts\ncould differ from one advocate of practical moral absolutes to\nanother. For example, one advocate might accept that it would be\nmorally permissible to torture the terrorist to save the lives of ten\ninnocent people threatened by a non-nuclear explosive device, whereas\nanother advocate might reject this on the grounds that ten lives are\ntoo few. What the two advocates would have in common is the belief\nthat even the revised ticking-bomb scenario involving only the death\nof ten innocent people is, nevertheless, a fanciful scenario that has\nnot occurred, and will not ever occur. In short, different advocates\nof practical absolutism can ascribe different moral weight to\ndifferent moral considerations, and we need to know what these\nweightings are for any given advocate. For otherwise it is extremely\ndifficult to assess the validity or plausibility of the associated\ngeneral empirical claim that in practice no act of torture has ever\nbeen, nor ever will be, morally justified. Roughly speaking, the\ngreater the moral weight that is given by the practical moral\nabsolutist to refraining from torture \u2013 this moral weight\nconsidered both in itself and relative to other moral\nconsiderations \u2013 the more plausible the associated general\nempirical claim becomes. On the other hand, the greater the\nmoral weight that is given to the principle of refraining from\ntorture, the less plausible the narrowly moral claims of the\npractical absolutist become \u2013 indeed, at the limit the practical\nabsolutist becomes a moral absolutist tout court.\n\nAt any rate, the general point to be made here is that the practical\nmoral absolutist owes us a principled account of the moral weight to\nbe attached to refraining from torture relative to other moral\nconsiderations. For without it we are unable to adequately assess\nwhether or not putative counter-examples to this position are really\ncounter-examples or not. It is not good enough for the practical moral\nabsolutist just to give the thumbs down to any putative\ncounter-example that is offered.\n\nThe third general point against the practical moral absolutist is to\nreiterate that it has already been argued that torture is not the\nmorally worst act that anyone could, or indeed has or will, perform.\nIf this is correct, then it is plausible that there will be at least\nsome scenarios in which one will be forced to choose between\ntwo evils, the lesser one of which is torture. Indeed, the\nabove-described police beating scenario (certainly) and the ticking\nbomb scenario (possibly) are cases in point.\n",
