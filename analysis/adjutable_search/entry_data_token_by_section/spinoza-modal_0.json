    "main_text": "The Distribution of Modality\n1. The Distribution of Modality\n\nSpinoza\u2019s list of the basic types of existing things is\nexceedingly short: substances and modes\n (Ip4d).[2]\n Spinoza gives two extremely different, but equally striking accounts\nof how many tokens exist under each of these two basic types. There is\nonly one existing substance, God, and there are infinitely many modes.\nWithout yet unpacking these claims, we might ask Spinoza, \u201cBut\ncould there have been more substances or fewer modes\nthan there in fact are?\u201d Or, keeping the number of tokens fixed,\n\u201cCould there have been a different substance or\ndifferent modes than the ones that in fact exist?\u201d\nSurprisingly, Spinoza seems inclined to answer \u201cno\u201d to\nthese questions. If so, then Spinoza thinks the actual world is the\nonly possible world. This is the position of\nnecessitarianism, a belief that few in the history of Western\nphilosophy have explicitly embraced. And for good reason \u2014 on\nthe face of it, necessaritianism is highly counterintuitive. Surely\nthe world could have gone slightly differently than it has gone.\nCouldn\u2019t the Allies have lost WWII? Couldn\u2019t a leaf have\nlanded an eighth of a centimeter farther to the right than it in fact\nlanded? Similarly, surely the world could have contained different\nindividuals in different numbers than it in fact contains.\nCouldn\u2019t Leibniz have had a sister or not been born at all?\n\nSpinoza was aware of how deeply against the grain of common sense the\ntruth of necessitarianism would run. If he nonetheless believed in its\ntruth, he must have thought he had very compelling reasons for doing\nso. What might such reasons be? We will begin with substance\nnecessitarianism (2.1) and then turn to the necessity of modes (2.2).\nAlthough the case for interpreting Spinoza as a mode necessitarian is\nstrong, there are also Spinoza-friendly reasons for resisting such a\nreading. Seeing this tension will lead us into the middle of an\ninterpretive controversy that has ramifications for understanding many\nof Spinoza\u2019s other central metaphysical views. (In section 2, we\nwill undercover one possible way of reconciling Spinoza\u2019s drive\ntowards necessitarianism with what might have been equally important\nreasons for avoiding it.)\n",
