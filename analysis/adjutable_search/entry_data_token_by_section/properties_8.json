    "main_text": "Exemplification\n2. Exemplification\n\nWe saw right at the outset that objects exemplify, or instantiate,\nproperties. More generally, items of all sorts, including properties\nthemselves, exemplify properties, or, in different terminology,\nbear, have or possess properties. Reversing\norder, we can also say that properties characterize, or\ninhere in, the items that exemplify them. There is then a\nvery general phenomenon of exemplification to investigate, which has\nbeen labeled in various ways, as the variety of terms of art just\ndisplayed testifies. All such terms have often been given special\ntechnical senses in the rich array of different explorations of this\nterritory since Ancient and Medieval times up to the present age (see,\ne.g., Lowe 2006: 77). These explorations can hardly be disentangled\nfrom the task of providing a general ontological picture with its own\ncategorial distinctions. In line with what most philosophers do\nnowadays, we choose \u201cexemplification\u201d, or, equivalently,\n\u201cinstantiation\u201d (and their cognates), to discuss this\nphenomenon in general and to approach some different accounts that\nhave been given of it in recent times. This sweeping use of these\nterms is to be kept distinct from the more specialized uses of them\nthat will surface below (and to some extent have already surfaced\nabove) in describing specific approaches by different philosophers\nwith their own terminologies.\n",
