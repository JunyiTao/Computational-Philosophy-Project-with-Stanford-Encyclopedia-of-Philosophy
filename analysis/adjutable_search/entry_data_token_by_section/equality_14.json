    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Capabilities Approaches\n3.8 Capabilities Approaches\n\nTheories that limit themselves to the equal distribution of basic\nmeans, in the hope of doing justice to the different goals of all\nhuman beings, are often criticized as fetishistic, because they focus\non means as opposed to what individuals gain with these means (Sen\n1980). The value that goods have for someone depends on objective\npossibilities, the natural environment, and individual capacities.\nHence, in contrast to the resourcist approach, Amartya Sen proposes\norientating distribution around \u201ccapabilities to achieve\nfunctionings,\u201d i.e., the various things that a person manages to\ndo orbe in leading a life (Sen 1992). In other words, evaluating\nindividual well-being has to be tied to a capability for achieving and\nmaintaining various precious conditions and \u201cfunctionings\u201d\nconstitutive of a person\u2019s being, such as adequate nourishment, good\nhealth, the ability to move about freely or to appear in public\nwithout shame. The real freedom to acquire well-being is also\nimportant here, a freedom represented in the capability to oneself\nchoose forms of achievement and the combination of\n\u201cfunctionings.\u201d For Sen, capabilities are thus the measure\nof an equality of capabilities human beings enjoy to lead\ntheir lives. A problem consistently raised with capability approaches\nis the ability to weigh capabilities in order to arrive at a metric\nfor equality. The problem is intensified by the fact that various\nmoral perspectives are blended in the concept of capability (Cohen\n1993, p. 17\u201326, Williams 1987). Martha Nussbaum (1992, 2000) has\nlinked the capability approach to an Aristotelian, essentialistic,\n\u201cthick\u201d theory of the good \u2013 a theory meant to be,\nas she puts it, \u201cvague,\u201d incomplete, and open-ended enough\nto leave place for individual and cultural variation. On the basis of\nsuch a \u201cthick\u201d conception of necessary and universal\nelements of a good life, certain capabilities and functionings can be\ndesignated as foundational. In this manner, Nussbaum can endow the\ncapability approach with a precision that furnishes an index of\ninterpersonal comparison, but at the risk of not being neutral enough\nregarding the plurality of personal conceptions of the good, a\nneutrality normally required by most liberals (most importantly Rawls\n1993; but see Robeyns 2009 for a different take on the comparison with\nRawls). For further discussion, see the entry on the\n capability approach.\n",
