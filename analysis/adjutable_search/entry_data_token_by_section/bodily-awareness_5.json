    "main_text": "The perceptual model of bodily awareness || The body as a perceptual object\n2.1 The body as a perceptual object\n\nMcGinn (1996: 8) claims: \u201cbodily sensations do not have an\nintentional object in the way perceptual experiences do\u201d. His\nview is shared by many, for at least two reasons: (i) the body cannot\nboth anchor our perception of the world and be an object of perception\nfor risk of infinite regress; and (ii) the body senses do not need to\nidentify and reidentify the body since they give information about\nnothing else.\n\nThe first objection comes from Merleau-Ponty (1945: 92), who claims:\n\u201cThe body is not one more among external objects\u201d. He\ndraws the distinction between the objective body made of muscles and\nbones, and the lived body (corps propre), that is, the body\nthat we experience in pre-reflective awareness. He argues that the\nlived body is not an object that can be perceived from various\nperspectives, left aside or localized in objective space. On the\ncontrary, it is the zero-point (Husserl 1913), from which one can see\nthe objective space. If one were to adopt an objective stance on the\nlived body, then the objectified body could no longer anchor the way\none perceives the world. Likewise, Gallagher (2003) argues that bodily\nexperiences should not be understood in perceptual terms. Using\nWittgenstein\u2019s distinction between the self as a subject and the\nself as an object, Gallagher argues that the lived body must be\nconceived as subject. Only then can it ground our conscious experience\nof the world. However, subjectivity is not incompatible with\nintentionality. Arguably, one can perceive the self as a subject\n(Berm\u00fadez 1998). Furthermore, the lived body can be a\nperceptual object without being transformed into an object among\nothers. Dokic (2003), for instance, claims that bodily sensations\ndisplay a special kind of perceptual awareness, but it is\nstill perceptual.\n\nThe second objection against the perceptual model follows from\nShoemaker\u2019s (1994) standard model of perception. On his view,\none key condition of perception is that the way of gaining information\nallows for identification and re-identification of the perceived\nobjects. The difficulty with the body senses is that they seem to give\naccess only to a single object, namely, one\u2019s body. Several\nanswers have been offered to this objection. For instance, Schwenkler\n(2013) replies that the body senses still convey facts about different\nobjects insofar as they convey facts about different parts of the\nbody. It is not clear, however, whether this suffices to refute the\nobjection. Martin (1995), on the other hand, defends what he calls the\nsole-object view, according to which bodily sensations are only about\none\u2019s body and when they are not, they are illusory or\nhallucinatory. Still, on his view, this does not prevent bodily\nsensations to be perceptual. One indeed experiences one\u2019s body\nas a bounded object. By becoming aware of bodily boundaries, one then\nbecomes aware of a larger space that contains one\u2019s body as well\nas other objects (see also Berm\u00fadez 1998).\n",
