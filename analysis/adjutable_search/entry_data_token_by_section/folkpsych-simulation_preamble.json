    "main_text": "\n\nThe capacity for \u201cmindreading\u201d is understood in philosophy\nof mind and cognitive science as the capacity to represent, reason\nabout, and respond to others\u2019 mental states. Essentially the\nsame capacity is also known as \u201cfolk psychology\u201d,\n\u201cTheory of Mind\u201d, and \u201cmentalizing\u201d. An\nexample of everyday mindreading: you notice that Tom\u2019s\nfright embarrassed Mary and surprised Bill,\nwho had believed that Tom wanted to try\neverything. Mindreading is of crucial importance for our social life:\nour ability to predict, explain, and/or coordinate with others\u2019\nactions on countless occasions crucially relies on representing their\nmental states. For instance, by attributing to Steve the desire for a\nbanana and the belief that there are no more bananas at home but there\nare some left at the local grocery store, you can: (i)\nexplain why Steve has just left home; (ii) predict\nwhere Steve is heading; and (iii) coordinate your behavior\nwith his (meet him at the store, or prepare a surpise party while he\nis gone). Without mindreading, (i)\u2013(iii) do not come\neasily\u2014if they come at all. That much is fairly uncontroversial.\nWhat is controversial is how to explain mindreading. That is, how do\npeople arrive at representing others\u2019 mental states? This is the\nmain question to which the Simulation (or, mental simulation) Theory\n(ST) of mindreading offers an answer.\n\nCommon sense has it that, in many circumstances, we arrive at\nrepresenting others\u2019 mental states by putting ourselves in their\nshoes, or taking their perspective. For example, I can try to figure\nout my chess opponent\u2019s next decision by imagining what I would\ndecide if I were in her place. (Although we may also speak of this as\na kind of empathy, that term must be understood here without\nany implication of sympathy or benevolence.)\n\nST takes this commonsensical idea seriously and develops it into a\nfully-fledged theory. At the core of the theory, we find the thesis\nthat mental simulation plays a central role in mindreading:\nwe typically arrive at representing others\u2019 mental states by\nsimulating their mental states in our own mind. So, to figure out my\nchess opponent\u2019s next decision, I mentally switch roles with her\nin the game. In doing this, I simulate her relevant beliefs\nand goals, and then feed these simulated mental states into\nmy decision-making mechanism and let the mechanism produce a simulated\ndecision. This decision is projected on or attributed to the\nopponent. In other words, the basic idea of ST is that if the\nresources our own brain uses to guide our own behavior can be modified\nto work as representations of other people\u2019s mental states, then\nwe have no need to store general information about what makes people\ntick: we just do the ticking for them. Accordingly, ST challenges the\nTheory-Theory of mindreading (TT), the view that a tacit psychological\ntheory underlies the ability to represent and reason about\nothers\u2019 mental states. While TT maintains that mindreading is an\ninformation-rich and theory-driven process, ST sees it as\ninformationally poor and process driven (Goldman 1989).\n\nThis entry is organized as follows. In section 1 (The Origins and\nVarieties of ST), we briefly reconstruct ST\u2019s history and\nelaborate further on ST\u2019s main theoretical aims. We then go on\nto explain the very idea of mental simulation (section 2: What is\nMeant by \u201cMental Simulation\u201d?) In section 3 (Two Types of\nSimulation Processes), we consider the cognitive architecture\nunderlying mental simulation and introduce the distinction between\nhigh-level and low-level simulation processes. In section 4 (The Role\nof Mental Simulation in Mindreading), we discuss what role mental\nsimulation is supposed to play in mindreading, according to ST. This\ndiscussion carries over to section 5 (Simulation Theory and\nTheory-Theory), where we contrast the accounts of mindreading given by\nST and TT. Finally, section 6 (Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons)\nexamines some of the main arguments in favour of and against ST as\ntheory of mindreading.\n",
