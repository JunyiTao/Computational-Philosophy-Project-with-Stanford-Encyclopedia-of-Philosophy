    "main_text": "Objections to the MWI || The Problem of Preferred Basis\n6.2 The Problem of Preferred Basis\n\nA common criticism of the MWI stems from the fact that the formalism\nof quantum theory allows infinitely many ways to decompose the quantum\nstate of the Universe into a superposition of orthogonal states. The\nquestion arises: \u201cWhy choose the particular decomposition (2)\nand not any other?\u201d Since other decompositions might lead to a\nvery different picture, the whole construction seems to lack\npredictive power.\n\nThe locality of physical interactions defines the preferred basis. As\ndescribed in Section 3.5, only localized states of macroscopic objects\nare stable. And indeed, due to the extensive research on decoherence,\nthe problem of preferred basis is not considered as a serious\nobjection anymore, see Wallace 2010a. Singling out position as a\npreferred variable for solving the preferred basis problem might be\nconsidered as a weakness, but on the other hand, it is implausible\nthat out of a mathematical theory of vectors in Hilbert space one can\nderive what our world should be. We have to add some ingredients to\nour theory and adding locality, the property of all known physical\ninteractions, seems to be very natural (in fact, it plays a crucial\nrole in all interpretations). Hemmo and Shenker 2020 also argued that\nsomething has to be added to the Hilbert space structure, but viewed\nthe addition of a locality of interaction postulate as the reason that\nOckham\u2019s razor does not cut in favour of the MWI. Note, that\ntaking position as a preferred variable is not an ontological claim\nhere, in contrast to the options discussed in the next section.\n",
