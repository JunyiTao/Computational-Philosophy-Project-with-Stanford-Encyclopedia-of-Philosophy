The relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is\nconfounded relative to variable set \\(\\b{Z}\\) just in\ncase \\(P(Y\\mid X,\\b{Z}) \\ne P(Y\\mid \\do(X),\\b{Z})\\) (i.e., the\nrelationship is not identified). A confounding set of\nvariables is one that biases the effect measurement.\nFor instance, an unmeasured common cause is a confounder because it\nmakes it impossible to differentiate the probabilistic dependence\nbetween the variables resulting from the common cause from that\nresulting from a causal relationship between them. Simpson\u2019s\nParadox emerges on this account due to confounding by the third\nvariable. This notion of confounding can diverge from a common\ncolloquial understanding of confounders as alternative explanations of\nan observed outcome other than the treatment.\n\nA useful sufficient condition for identifiability is the\nback-door criterion (Pearl 1993, 2000 [2009: 79]).\nFirst we need to introduce some graphical terminology. A path\nbetween \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be a set of connected edges between \\(X\\) and\n\\(Y\\) going in any direction. \\(Y\\) is a descendant of \\(X\\)\nif there is a path from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) in which all the arrows go in\nthe same direction. When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are connected via a single\npath including a common cause such as \\(X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow\nY\\), \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) will\n typically[6]\n be unconditionally probabilistically dependent, but will be\nindependent conditional on \\(Z\\). For such a path, we say that \\(Z\\)\nblocks the path between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). In contrast, when\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are connected by a path including a common\neffect, such as \\(X \\rightarrow Z \\leftarrow Y\\), then the\npath will be blocked provided that one does not condition on\n\\(Z\\) or a descendant of \\(Z\\). This reflects the fact that\nindependent causes of a common effect will typically be dependent\nconditional on a common effect. An effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is\nidentifiable if there are no unblocked \u201cback-door paths\u201d\nbetween \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): all paths that pass through common causes are\nblocked, and all other paths excepting those by which the cause\ninfluences its effect are open.\n\n\nBack-door Criterion (Pearl 1993) Given a\nvariable pair \\(\\{X,Y\\}\\) in a DAG G, the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is\nidentifiable if there exists a variable set \\(\\b{Z}\\) in G\nsatisfying the following conditions:\n\nNo node in \\(\\b{Z}\\) is a descendant of \\(X\\), and\n\\(\\b{Z}\\) blocks every path between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) containing an\narrow into \\(X\\).\n\n\nIn this case, the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is identified by the\nformula \n\n  \\[\\tag{5}\n  p(\\r{Y}\\mid \\do(\\r{X})) = \\sum_{Z} p(\\r{Y}\\mid \\r{X},\\r{Z}) \\, p(\\r{Z})\\]\n  \n\n\nEquation (5)\n reveals that can be possible to derive a causal effect in a\npopulation by averaging over the effects in subpopulations partitioned\nby \\(Z\\). This is what we already saw in\n Section 2.2:\n if there is no dependence between being treated and being a part of a\nsubpopulation, associations cannot reverse at the general population\nlevel. Yet such a derivation is only licensed by causal assumptions\nabout the relationships between the variables. The reader can verify\nthat given the DAG in\n Figure 2,\n the variables satisfy the back-door criterion (with\n \\(\\b{Z}=\\{\\textit{Gender}\\}\\)).[7]\n\nIn our original example, the treatment increased the probability of\nrecovery in each subpopulation, but not it in the population as a\nwhole. Should one approve the drug or not? The causal approach makes\nit easy to see why one should. The probabilistic relationship between\nTreatment and Success in the population is an\nevidential rather than a causal one. Learning that someone took the\ndrug provides evidence about their gender, and this information is\nrelevant to predicting whether they will recover. But this does not\ntell one about whether the drug is causally efficacious. To learn\nthis, one needs to know how the chances of recovery for individuals in\nthe population would change given an intervention on\ntreatment. This can be determined by conditioning on gender\nwhich enables one both to learn the gender-specific effects of the\ndrug, and to derive the average effect in the whole population (using\nthe back-door criterion).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The DAG for the variables\nTreatment, Gender and Success (third\nvariable = confounding factor), contrasted with the DAG for the\nvariables Birth Control, Pregnancy, and\nThrombosis (third variable = mediator).\n\n\nThus, whether one should partition the population based on a factor in\norder to identify a particular causal relationship does not depend\nonly on the statistical distribution, but crucially on one\u2019s\ncausal background assumptions. Suppose that one was considering an\nintermediate variable such as Pregnancy in Hesslow\u2019s\n(1976) example. Recall that in the example birth control influences\nthrombosis both positively via a blood chemical and negatively by\nreducing one\u2019s chance of getting pregnant. This case is shown in\n Figure 3\n and contrasted with our running example where the third variable is a\nconfounding factor. In order to identify the effect of birth control\non thrombosis, it is crucial that one does not condition on\npregnancy. If there are no unmeasured common causes of birth control\nand thrombosis, then a probability-raising relationship between birth\ncontrol and thrombosis in the population as a whole would reliably\nindicate that taking birth control pills promotes thrombosis.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that there is no basis for distinguishing the\ntwo causal structures in\n Figure 3\n using statistics alone. Any data generated by the model on the left\ncould also have been generated by a model with the causal structure of\nthat on the right. Accordingly the judgment that one should partition\nthe population in one case but not the other cannot be based on the\nprobabilities alone, but requires the additional information supplied\nby the causal model.\n\nCoherent with\n Theorem 1,\n Pearl proves a causal version of Savage\u2019s (1954) sure-thing\nprinciple (see also\n Section 5.3):\n\n\nCausal sure-thing principle (Pearl 2016) An\naction \\(\\r{C}\\) that increases the probability of an event \\(\\r{E}\\)\nin each subpopulation must also increase the probability of \\(\\r{E}\\)\nin the population as a whole, provided that the action does not change\nthe distribution of the\n subpopulations.[8]\n\n\nFor example, if one assumes that Gender is not an effect of\nTreatment, it cannot be the case that the drug raises the\nprobability of recovery in both males and females, but has no effect\non recovery in the general population. This result provides an error\ntheory for why people often find Simpson\u2019s Paradox to be\nparadoxical in the first place. Specifically, Pearl (2000 [2009],\n2014) claims that people conflate observational claims that \\(\\r{X}\\)\nraises the probability of \\(\\r{Y}\\) with causal claims that\ndoing \\(\\r{X}\\) (versus \\(\\neg\\r{X}\\)) would raise the\nprobability of \\(\\r{Y}\\). And assuming that the partitioning variable\nis not an effect of \\(X\\), it is impossible for doing\n\\(\\r{X}\\) to raise the probability of \\(\\r{Y}\\) in all subpopulations,\nbut not in the population as a whole. So Pearl\u2019s explanation of\nthe paradox is that people conflate causal and non-causal expressions,\nand if the conditional probabilities in the examples are interpreted\ncausally, Simpson\u2019s reversals are impossible.\n",
