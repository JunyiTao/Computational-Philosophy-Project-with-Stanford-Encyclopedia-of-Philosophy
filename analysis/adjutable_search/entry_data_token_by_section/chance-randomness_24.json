Conclusion\n\n\nFrom what we have seen, the commonplace thesis cannot be sustained.\nIt would in many ways have been nice if chance of a process and\nrandomness of its product had gone hand in hand\u2014the epistemology\nof chance would be much aided if it invariably showed itself in random\noutputs, and we could have had a tight constraint on what outcomes to\nexpect of a repeated chance process, to say nothing of the further\ninteresting consequences the thesis may have for random sampling or\nprobabilistic explanation, mentioned in the introduction. But the\ncounterexamples to the thesis in\n \u00a7\u00a74\u20135\n show that it is false, even in\nits most plausible form. Various attempts to salvage the thesis, by\nappeal to non-standard accounts of chance or randomness, fail to give\nus a version of the thesis of much interest or bearing on the issues we\nhad hoped it would illuminate. A final attempt to argue directly for\nthe thesis from the connections between chance, randomness, and\ndeterminism also failed, though it does shed light on all three\nnotions. It is safest, therefore, to conclude that chance and\nrandomness, while they overlap in many cases, are separate\nconcepts.\n\n\nThis is not to say that there is no link between KML-randomness and\nphysical chance. The observation of a random sequence of outcomes is a\ndefeasible incentive to inquire into the physical basis of the outcome\nsequence, and it provides at least a prima facie reason to think that a\nprocess is chancy (though recall\n \u00a74.5).\nMoreover, if we knew that a process is chancy, we should expect\n(eventually, with high and increasing probability) a random sequence of\noutcomes. Conversely, a sequence of outcomes that appears predictable, compressible, and rule-governed will be strong disconfirming evidence for any hypothesis to the effect that the sequence was produced by chance alone. \nHellman concludes\nThe link, then, between mathematical and physical randomness is epistemic and only that. Observations of mathematically non-random sequences can be used to decide when further explanation in terms of as yet undiscovered causal factors is wanting. But, in no sense is any notion of mathematical randomness serving as an explication for \u2018ultimate physical randomness\u2019, whatever that might be. (Hellman, 1978: 86)\n\n\nTaking \u2018mathematical randomness\u2019 to be product randomness, and \u2018physical randomness\u2019 to mean process randomness (chanciness), this conclusion seems unavoidable.\n\nA parallel with the relationship between frequencies and chances is tempting and unsurprising. Relative frequencies are good but not infallible indicators of the chances, and the existence of outcome frequencies strictly between 0 and 1 is evidence that chance processes are involved in the production of those outcomes. But frequentism is implausible as a reductive account of chance. And it is no more plausible to think that chance is present iff random sequences of outcomes are.[27] An evidential and epistemic connection between chance\nand randomness falls well short of the conceptual connection proposed\nby the Commonplace Thesis with which we started.\n",
