    "main_text": "Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth || The New Riddle of Induction\n1.2 The New Riddle of Induction\n\nNelson Goodman posed a famous puzzle about inductive inference known\nas the (New) Riddle of Induction ([Goodman 1983]). Our next example is\ninspired by his puzzle. Goodman considered generalizations about\nemeralds, involving the familiar colours of green and blue, as well as\ncertain unusual ones:\n\nSuppose that all emeralds examined before a certain time \\(t\\)\nare green \u2026. Our evidence statements assert that emerald \\(a\\)\nis green, that emerald \\(b\\) is green, and so on\u2026.\n\n\nNow let us introduce another predicate less familiar than\n\u201cgreen\u201d. It is the predicate \u201cgrue\u201d and it\napplies to all things examined before \\(t\\) just in case they are\ngreen but to other things just in case they are blue. Then at time\n\\(t\\) we have, for each evidence statement asserting that a given\nemerald is green, a parallel evidence statement asserting that emerald\nis grue. The question is whether we should conjecture that all\nemeralds are green rather than that all emeralds are grue when we\nobtain a sample of green emeralds examined before time \\(t\\), and\nif so, why.\n\n\nClearly we have a family of grue predicates in this problem, one for\neach different \u201ccritical time\u201d \\(t\\); let\u2019s\nwrite grue\\((t)\\) to denote these grue predicates. Following\nGoodman, let us refer to methods as  projection rules  in\ndiscussing this example. A projection rule succeeds in a world just in\ncase it settles on a generalization that is correct in that world.\nThus in a world in which all examined emeralds are found to be green,\nwe want our projection rule to converge to the proposition that all\nemeralds are green. If all examined emeralds are grue\\((t)\\), we\nwant our projection rule to converge to the proposition that all\nemeralds are grue\\((t)\\). Note that this stipulation treats green\nand grue predicates completely on a par, with no bias towards either.\nAs before, let us consider two rules: the  natural projection\nrule which conjectures that all emeralds are green as long as only\ngreen emeralds are found, and the gruesome rule which keeps\nprojecting the next grue predicate consistent with the available\nevidence. Expressed in the green-blue vocabulary, the gruesome\nprojection rule conjectures that after observing some number of\n\\(n\\) green emeralds, all future ones will be blue. The figures\nbelow illustrates the possible observation sequences, the natural\nprojection rule, and the gruesome projection rule.\n\n\nFigure 3 [An extended description of figure 3 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nThe following figure shows the gruesome projection rule.\n\n\nFigure 4 [An extended description of figure 4 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nHow do these rules measure up to the goal of arriving at a true\ngeneralization? Suppose for the sake of the example that the only\nserious possibilities under consideration are: (1) Either all emeralds\nare green or (2) all emeralds are grue\\((t)\\) for some critical\ntime \\(t\\). Then the natural projection rule settles on the\ncorrect generalization no matter what the correct generalization is.\nFor if all emeralds are green, the natural projection rule asserts\nthis fact from the beginning. And suppose that all emeralds are\ngrue\\((t)\\) for some critical time \\(t\\). Then at time\n\\(t\\), a blue emerald will be observed. At this point the natural\nprojection rule settles on the conjecture that all emeralds are\ngrue\\((t)\\), which must be correct given our assumption about the\npossible observation sequences. Thus no matter what evidence is\nobtained in the course of inquiry\u2014consistent with our background\nassumptions\u2014the natural projection rule eventually settles on a\ncorrect generalization about the colour of emeralds.\n\nThe gruesome rule does not do as well. For if all emeralds are green,\nthe rule will never conjecture this fact because it keeps projecting\ngrue predicates. Hence there is a possible observation\nsequence\u2014namely those on which all emeralds are green\u2014on\nwhich the gruesome rule fails to converge to the right generalization.\nSo means-ends analysis would recommend the natural projection rule\nover the gruesome rule.\n",
