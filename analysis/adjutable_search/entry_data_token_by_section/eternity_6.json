    "main_text": "Some Views on God and Time\n4. Some Views on God and Time\n\nIt has recently been suggested that there are actually two orthogonal\nissues regarding God\u2019s relationship to time: (1) whether God is\nlocated in our spacetime\u2014the spacetime investigated by modern\nphysics; and (2) whether God is eternal or everlasting. (Note that\nthis is the terminology not employed here.) God could be eternal, with\na life that\u2019s not marked by temporal succession, while being\nlocated at every spacetime point. Conversely, God could be everlasting\nwhile not located in physical spacetime at all (Murray & Rea 2008:\nCh. 2).\n\nAt first sight, this distinction can seem to leave the second issue\nsomewhat mysterious: if it is not being located in our, physical\nspacetime, then what is it? What can it mean to say that an entity is\neverlasting, or exists at all times, if that doesn\u2019t commit one\nto a view on whether that entity is located in spacetime? What then\nare times\u2014are they not somehow to be understood in terms of\nspacetime, ultimately?\n\nBut there are two distinct issues in the vicinity. One is about\nGod\u2019s life, or, for want of a better phrase, the nature of\nGod\u2019s experience. Whether or not a being experiences succession,\nand more generally, what the (a)temporal features of its experience\nare, is distinct from whether or not that being is located in\nspacetime.\n\nHowever, there are also connections between these issues. The beings\nwe are most familiar with, such as ourselves, are spatiotemporal and\nexperience temporal succession; and for us, these facts are related.\nIt is partly because we are located in spacetime that we experience\nsuccession, and there are interesting questions about the details of\nthis connection.\n\nThis section outlines some views on God and time, with a focus on the\ncontemporary literature; further reading suggestions appear at the end\nof this section. Each view may involve claims both about whether God\nis located in time/spacetime, and about (a)temporal features of\nGod\u2019s experience. Specifically, timelessness views may involve\nboth the claim that God is not located in time/spacetime, and the\nclaim that God\u2019s life is atemporal, for example in the sense\nthat God doesn\u2019t experience succession. Similarly, temporal\nviews may involve both the claim that God is in time/spacetime and\nthat God\u2019s life is temporal, for example in the sense that God\nexperiences succession.\n",
