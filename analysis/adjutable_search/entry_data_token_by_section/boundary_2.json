    "main_text": "Issues || Natural vs. Artificial Boundaries\n1.2 Natural vs. Artificial Boundaries\n\nA second sort of puzzle relates to the fact that Aristotle\u2019s\nmereological (parthood-based) definition, and the common-sense\nintuition that it captures, seem to apply only to the realm of\ncontinuous entities. Modulo the above-mentioned difficulty, the\nthought that Maryland and Pennsylvania are bounded by the Mason-Dixon\nline is fair enough. But ordinary material objects \u2014 it might be\nobserved \u2014 are not truly continuous and speaking of an\nobject\u2019s boundary is like speaking of the \u201cflat top\u201d\nof a fakir\u2019s bed of nails (Simons 1991: 91). On closer\ninspection, the spatial boundaries of physical objects are imaginary\nentities surrounding swarms of subatomic particles, and their exact\nshape and location involve the same degree of idealization of a\ndrawing obtained by \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d, the same degree\nof arbitrariness as any mathematical graph smoothed out of scattered\nand inexact data, the same degree of abstraction as the figures\u2019\ncontours in a Seurat painting. Similarly, on closer inspection a\nbody\u2019s being in motion amounts to the fact that the vector sum\nof the motions of zillions of restless particles, averaged over time,\nis non-zero, hence it makes no sense to speak of the instant\nat which a body stops moving (Galton 1994: 4). All this may be seen as\ngood news vis-\u00e0-vis the generalized puzzles of Section\n1.1, which would not even get off the ground (at least in the form\ngiven above; see Smith 2007 and Wilson 2008 for qualifications). But\nthen the question arises: Is our boundary talk a mere fa\u00e7on\nde parler? Even with reference to the Mason-Dixon line \u2014\nand, more generally, those boundaries that demarcate adjacent parts of\na continuous manifold, as when an individual cognitive agent\nconceptualizes a black spot as being made of two halves \u2014 one\ncan raise the question of their ontological status. Such boundaries\nare puzzling; but are they real? After all, they stem\nentirely from our social practices and from the organizing activity of\nour intellect. It might be argued, therefore, that belief in their\nobjectivity epitomizes a form of metaphysical realism that cries for\njustification. Do such boundaries really exist?\n\nWe may, in this connection, introduce a conceptual distinction between\n\u201cnatural\u201d or bona fide boundaries, which would be\nobjective insofar as they are grounded in some physical discontinuity\nor qualitative heterogeneity betwixt an entity and its surroundings,\nand \u201cartificial\u201d or fiat boundaries, which are\nnot so grounded in the autonomous, mind-independent world (Smith 1995,\nbuilding on Curzon 1907). The coastline of Britain, or the boundary\nseparating a black spot from its white background, might be examples\nof the former, but geopolitical boundaries such as the Mason-Dixon\nline, or the boundary between the top and the bottom halves of the\nblack spot, are clearly of the latter sort. Moreover, just as\nfiat boundaries may be involved in the partitioning of larger\nwholes into proper parts, so they are often at work when we\ncircumclude a number of smaller entities into larger wholes: think of\nBenelux or Polynesia, but also of the easiness with which we represent\nthe world as consisting of forests, swarms of bees, constellations, or\nwhen we group our actions into baseball games, electoral campaigns,\nwars, etc. (Smith 1999b). Now, insofar as they are not truly\ncontinuous, even the surfaces of ordinary material objects \u2014\nhence the boundaries of the individual trees, the individual bees, the\nindividual stars \u2014 may be said to involve fiat\ndemarcations of just the same sort. (Cf. Goodman: \u201cWe make a\nstar as we make a constellation, by putting its parts together and\nmarking off its boundaries\u201d; 1980: 213.) On closer inspection,\neven the boundaries of our individual actions may be seen in this\nlight, indeed even a person\u2019s birth and death may to some extent\nreflect conventional decisions and stipulations, witness the\ncontroversies on abortion and euthanasia (see the entries on\n life\n and\n the definition of death).\n On closer inspection, even the extolled coastline of Britain is to\nsome extent fixed by us, witness the proverbial elusiveness of its\nobjective length and location (Mandelbrot 1967). So the question\narises: are there any natural, mind-independent, genuine\nbona fide boundaries? The natural/artificial distinction is\nintuitively clear; but how robust is it? Are there any concepts that\ntruly carve the world \u201cat the joints\u201d, as per\nPlato\u2019s butchering guidelines (Phaedrus, 265e)? And, if\nnot, is the fiat nature of our boundary talk a reason to\njustify an anti-realist attitude towards boundaries altogether?\n\nThe question has deep ramifications. For once the fiat/bona\nfide opposition has been recognized, it is clear that it can be\ndrawn not merely in relation to boundaries, but also in relation to\nthose entities that may be said to have boundaries (Smith and\nVarzi 2000; Smith 2001, 2019; Tahko 2012; Davies 2019). If (part of)\ntheir boundaries are artificial \u2014 if they reflect the\narticulation of reality that is effected through human cognition and\nsocial practices \u2014 then those entities themselves may be viewed\nas conceptual constructions, a product of our worldmaking, hence the\nquestion of the ontological status of fiat boundaries becomes\nof a piece with the more general issue of the conventional status of\nordinary objects and events. This is not to imply that we end up with\nimaginary or otherwise unreal wholes: as Frege wrote, the objectivity\nof the North Sea \u201cis not affected by the fact that it is a\nmatter of our arbitrary choice which part of all the water on the\nearth\u2019s surface we mark off and elect to call the \u2018North\nSea\u2019\u201d (1884, \u00a726). Or as James wrote, echoing\nMichelangelo: \u201cThe mind works on the data it receives very much\nas a sculptor works on his block of stone; in a sense the statue stood\nthere from eternity\u201d (1890: I/188). It does, however, follow\nthat the entities in question would only enjoy an individuality as a\nresult of our selective strokes: their objectivity is independent of\nus, but their individuality \u2014 their being the sorts of thing\nthey are, perhaps even their having the identity and persistence\nconditions they have \u2014 would depend on our choices and our\nidentification and reidentification criteria (Sidelle 1989; Heller\n1990; Zerubavel 1991; Jubien 1993; Varzi 2011, 2016; Azzouni 2017;\nPiras 2020).\n\nThese ramifications go well beyond the concerns of metaphysics; they\nextend across the board, especially insofar as we have a tendency to\ncall \u201cnatural\u201d exactly those boundaries that best suit our\nparochial interests. In the geopolitical domain, for instance, the\nrhetoric with which certain frontiers have been claimed to be\ndrawn by the hand of Nature, if not by the hand of God, has been\nresponsible for some of the most tragic vicissitudes in our history,\nas even Lord Curzon \u2014 the epitome of British imperialism \u2014\nrecognized (1907: 54). There is by now a large body of literature on\nthis topic, stemming mostly from the classic works of Reclus\n(1905\u20131908), Febvre (1922), and Ancel (1938) (see Broek 1941\nand, for recent overviews, Rankin and Schofield 2004 and Fall 2010).\nBut similar considerations apply to all sorts of atrocities that we\ncommitted and continue to commit in all sorts of domains. That\nrhetoric is at work every time we invoke Plato\u2019s carving\nguidelines fraudulently and surreptitiously, every time we stigmatize\nas a \u201cbad butcher\u201d whoever holds views or follows\npractices that don\u2019t match our own as though they were\n\u201cagainst nature\u201d. This does not mean that the guidelines\nthemselves are corrupt; the realist is still free to take them\nseriously, if cautiously. But is there any viable way to implement\nthem irrespective of our ideological, cultural, and individual biases?\nWe can hardly be wrong in attributing fiat status to a\nboundary that is manifestly drawn by us; but who can vet the\nobjectivity of a natural joint? Recent work in feminist metaphysics\nand epistemology and in the philosophy and sociology of race has\nbrought these issues to the fore (see the entries on\n feminist metaphysics,\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science,\n race,\n and the\n critical philosophy of race).\n No theory of boundaries can ignore them. \n",
