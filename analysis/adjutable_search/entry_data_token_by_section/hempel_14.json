    "main_text": "Explanation, Prediction, Retrodiction || The Paradoxes of Explanation\n5.2 The Paradoxes of Explanation\n\nIndeed, in the process of drawing the distinction between\nexplanation-seeking and reason-seeking why-questions, Hempel (1965c)\nproposed a different kind of symmetry thesis, where adequate answers\nto explanation-seeking why-questions also provide adequate answers to\nreason-seeking why-questions, but not conversely. That was very\nappropriate, since the purpose of reason-seeking why-questions is to\nestablish grounds for believing that the event described by the\nexplanandum sentence has taken (or will take) place, while\nexplanation-seeking why-questions typically take for granted that we\nknow their explanandum events have already occurred. It follows that,\nwhile Hempel\u2019s conditions are meant to specify when we know\nwhy, they also entail how we know that.\n\nInsofar as Hempel focused on logically equivalent formulations of\nlawlike sentences in addressing the paradoxes of confirmation, some\nmay find it remarkable that he does not explore the consequences of\nlogically equivalent formulations in relation to explanations. We tend\nto assume we can explain why a specific thing \\(c\\) is\nblack on the grounds that it is a raven and all ravens are black. Yet\nwe would hesitate to explain why a specific thing is not a raven on\nthe ground that it is not black. We may refer to this as the\nparadox of transposition. Notice, the contention that one member\nof a class of logically equivalent hypotheses is explanatory but\nothers are not generates \u201cparadoxes of explanation\u201d that\nparallel the \u201cparadoxes of confirmation\u201d (Fetzer 2000a).\nFigure 5 offers an illustration:\n\\[ \\frac{\\begin{gathered} (x)(\\neg Bx \\supset \\neg Rx)\\\\ \\neg Bc\\end{gathered}}{\\neg Rc} \\]\n\n\nFigure 5. The Transposition Paradox\n\n\nEven if we accept the transposed form of \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\supset\nBx)\\)\u201d as the basis for an answer to a reason-seeking\nwhy-question\u2014in this case, how we know that\n\\(c\\) is no raven\u2014Figure 5 surely does not\nexplain why that is the case, which presumably has to do with\nthe genes of entity \\(c\\) and its developmental history\nas a living thing. If logically equivalent forms equally qualify as\nlawlike\u2014there\u2019s no basis in extensional logic to deny\nit\u2014then Hempel confronts a dilemma. In fact, by his own\nconditions of adequacy, this argument is not only explanatory but also\npredictive. It is not a \u201cpostdiction\u201d as he has\ndefined it above, but it appears to qualify as a\n\u201cretrodiction\u201d that does not explain its explanandum\nevent.\n\nSuppose Hempel were to resort to Goodman\u2019s approach and deny\nthat the negation of a purely qualitative predicates is also a purely\nqualitative predicate. That would mean that sentences logically\nequivalent to lawlike sentences\u2014which have the same\ncontent\u2014are not therefore also lawlike by invoking pragmatic\ndifferences in their degree of entrenchment and projectibility of\ntheir constituent predicates. An appeal to pragmatic considerations\nwithin this context has a decidedly ad hoc quality about it,\nwhich appears to contravene the spirit of the paradoxes of\nconfirmation, where Hempel insists that the counterintuitive cases are\nconfirmatory and their paradoxical character is merely psychological.\nEven if Hempel were to adopt this position and take for granted that\none member of a class of logically equivalent sentences can be lawlike\nwhile the others are not, another difficulty arises from the use of\nmodus tollens in lieu of modus ponens, as Figure 6\nexemplifies:\n\\[\\frac{\\begin{gathered} (x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\\\ \\neg Bc \\end{gathered}} {\\neg Rc} \\]\n\n\nFigure 6. The Modus Tollens Paradox\n\n\nHere we have a more threatening problem, since there is no apparent\nbasis for denying that an argument having this form satisfies\nHempel\u2019s criteria and therefore ought to be both explanatory\nand predictive. Similarly for temporally quantified arguments,\nwhere the fact that a match of kind \\(K\\) has not\nlighted at \\(t^*\\) would certainly not be adequate to explain why\nit was not struck at t, even though every match of kind \\(K\\)\nwill light when it is struck, under suitable\nconditions! Something serious thus appears to be wrong (Fetzer\n2000a).\n",
