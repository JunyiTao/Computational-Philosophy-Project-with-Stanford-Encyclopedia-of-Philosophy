    "main_text": "The Positions || Permissivism\n1.3 Permissivism\n\nPermissive views are those according to which there are wide swathes\nof extraordinary objects.\n\nUniversalism is the permissivist thesis that composition is\nunrestricted: for any objects, there is a single object that is\ncomposed of those objects. What universalism does not tell us is which\nkinds of objects there are. Whenever there are some atoms\narranged turkeywise, universalism entails that there is some\nobject that they compose. But it remains open to universalists (like\nthe aforementioned non-nihilistic eliminativists) to deny that this\ncomposite is a turkey. However, assuming that there are such objects\nas turkeys, trout, and their front and back halves, universalism will\nentail that there are trout-turkeys, where a trout-turkey is a single\nobject composed of the undetached front half of a trout and the\nundetached back half of a turkey. These are objects that have both\nfins and feathers and whose finned parts may be a good distance from\ntheir feathered\n parts.[7]\n\nDiachronic universalism is the permissivist thesis that, for any times\nand any function from those times to sets of objects that exist at\nthose times, there is an object that exists at just those times and\nhas exactly those parts at those times. Roughly: there is an object\ncorresponding to every filled region of spacetime. So, assuming that\nyour kitchen table and living room table both exist, there also exists\na klable: an object that\u2019s entirely made up of your kitchen\ntable every day from midnight till noon and is entirely made up of\nyour living room table from noon till midnight. This is an object\nthat, twice a day, instantly and imperceptibly shifts its\n location.[8]\n\nSome accept even more plenitudinous forms of permissivism.\nFormulations vary, but the rough idea is that, so long as the\nempirical facts don\u2019t rule out there being an object with a\ngiven modal property in a given location, then there is an object in\nthat location with that modal property. When there is a red car parked\nin the garage, the empirical facts (e.g., that there is nothing blue\nthere) do rule out there being an object in the exact location of the\ncar that is necessarily blue. But they do not rule out there being an\nobject colocated with the car that is inside the garage as a matter of\nmetaphysical necessity (an \u201cincar\u201d) and that would cease to exist if\nthe car were to leave the\n garage.[9]\n\nOne further way of being a permissivist is by permitting a multitude\nof parts of ordinary objects that we do not naturally judge\nthem to have. For instance, one might hold that, in addition to\nordinary parts like arms and legs, you have extraordinary parts like\nleg complements, where your left-leg complement is an object made up\nof all of you except for your left leg. Together with some natural\nassumptions (e.g., about regions of space), leg complements and a\nlegion of other extraordinary parts will be delivered by the doctrine\nof arbitrary undetached parts\u2014or DAUP\u2014the thesis that for\nany material object o, if r is the region of space occupied by o, and\nif r\u2032 is an occupiable sub-region of r, then there exists a\nmaterial object that exactly occupies r\u2032 and which is part of o.\n(Roughly: for every region of space within the boundaries of a given a\nobject, that object has a part that exactly fills that\n region.)[10]\n",
