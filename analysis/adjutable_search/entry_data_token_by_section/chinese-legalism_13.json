    "main_text": "The Ruler\n5. The Ruler\n\nThe fa thinkers in general and Han Fei in particular are\noften condemned as defenders of \u201cmonarchic despotism\u201d and\n\u201cabsolute authoritarianism\u201d (Hsiao 1979: 386, 417).\nWhereas this verdict is not unanimous\u2014Angus C. Graham, for\ninstance, opined that Han Fei\u2019s system makes sense only\n\u201cif seen from the viewpoint of the bureaucrat rather than the\nman at the top\u201d (Graham 1989: 290\u2013292)\u2014it is fairly\nwidespread. In light of the fa thinkers\u2019 profound\nanti-ministerial stance, it is indeed easy to conclude that they were\nfully committed to the ruler alone. And yet, their endorsement of the\nruler is not devoid of deep underlying tension. The fa\nthinkers are devoted to the ruler as an institution, the sole\nguarantor of social and political order, but not necessarily to an\nindividual sovereign, whose weaknesses they realize well. In Han\nFeizi in particular, this tension between an abstract and a\nconcrete ruler attains truly tragic proportions.\n",
